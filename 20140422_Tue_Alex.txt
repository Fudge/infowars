[00:00.000 --> 00:11.600]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.600 --> 00:19.160]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.160 --> 00:35.040]  Texas Alex Jones the main White House propaganda bureau openly run and
[00:35.040 --> 00:42.440]  administered by former White House operatives has officially come out and
[00:42.440 --> 00:48.480]  attacked yours truly and the Bundy supporters in the ongoing standoff with
[00:48.480 --> 00:53.160]  the tyrannical BLM they have come out and officially called us extremist and
[00:53.160 --> 01:00.840]  terrorist basically and are busy demonizing the true independent free
[01:00.840 --> 01:07.800]  press in this country and again MSNBC lost 24% of their viewers last year
[01:07.800 --> 01:12.600]  they are in a total free fall their top shows have half a million viewers that
[01:12.600 --> 01:19.320]  is joke level but the reason we report on them is that they are a talking point
[01:19.320 --> 01:27.040]  then a battle order system a telegraph system to the rest of their operatives
[01:27.040 --> 01:32.160]  and it goes from the White House directly to MSNBC White House directly
[01:32.160 --> 01:37.400]  to CNN White House directly to media matters and of course media matters
[01:37.400 --> 01:42.160]  literally has almost zero traffic they're the size online maybe of a small
[01:42.160 --> 01:48.520]  town newspaper but the readers of it are the adult what's left of the dinosaur
[01:48.520 --> 01:54.720]  media who go there to scoop up the regurgitated lies to re regurgitate them
[01:54.720 --> 01:59.880]  on down the line against us so this is a big deal and it ties into what I've got
[01:59.880 --> 02:02.920]  into some yesterday but I'm going to cover in great detail I'm just gonna get
[02:02.920 --> 02:08.080]  to it in the first hour so we cover it and that is the documents released by the
[02:08.080 --> 02:12.680]  Clinton Library that we're going to be showing you on screen they're linked in
[02:12.680 --> 02:18.800]  the Breitbart article and they're linked to the World Net Daily article where
[02:18.800 --> 02:25.440]  they three years before drudge broke the big Clinton stories on the missiles and
[02:25.440 --> 02:30.640]  the Monica Lewinsky and and the rapes and the murders and all the rest of it
[02:30.640 --> 02:34.960]  drudge was already operating then but before he totally dominated you know the
[02:34.960 --> 02:41.120]  entire Internet the Western Journalism Center run by Joseph Farah was operating
[02:41.120 --> 02:47.560]  and the system was accurately predicting how successful it would be and then it
[02:47.560 --> 02:52.160]  must be defeated and how to give talking points to the controlled corporate
[02:52.160 --> 02:56.400]  press now it's a 300-plus page memo the Clint has only released 30-something
[02:56.400 --> 03:04.240]  pages and it is mind-boggling just to see how open they are about their
[03:04.240 --> 03:08.960]  program to tell the controlled press anyone that questions us is a
[03:08.960 --> 03:13.760]  conspiracy theorist and this is how you shut them down so we're going to be
[03:13.760 --> 03:18.480]  discussing that and how they fear grassroots media commentary or even
[03:18.480 --> 03:23.840]  ideas you being able to say you don't like BLM having 90% of the land in
[03:23.840 --> 03:28.960]  Nevada you saying you don't like Obama giving missiles any aircraft missiles
[03:28.960 --> 03:32.840]  al-Qaeda in Syria they want to be able to wall you off and make you feel like
[03:32.840 --> 03:40.520]  you're alone and they describe how local news stories could get into the Western
[03:40.520 --> 03:44.880]  Journalism Center and other real conservative publications and then end
[03:44.880 --> 03:49.640]  up hitting regional papers then national papers and how investigations in a
[03:49.640 --> 03:55.720]  criminal activity like Hillary's cattle gate or or suicide gate could come out
[03:55.720 --> 04:01.720]  can you imagine what's in the almost 300 pages that's redacted that we're not
[04:01.720 --> 04:06.680]  able to get by the way guys I had it yesterday I just want it pulled out of
[04:06.680 --> 04:12.440]  the stack in fact here it is you added it Clinton administration fears
[04:12.440 --> 04:16.880]  internet's ability to democratize news three years before drudge bombshell and
[04:16.880 --> 04:20.760]  then newly released Clinton document describes internet as right-wing tool
[04:20.760 --> 04:25.120]  of conspiracy commerce what they're afraid of is us creating our own system
[04:25.120 --> 04:30.360]  to self-fund to not be dependent on Rockefeller money federal money big
[04:30.360 --> 04:34.680]  globalist money because again they're afraid of us self-funding voting with
[04:34.680 --> 04:38.400]  dollars just like you couldn't get organic food 20 years ago now it's
[04:38.400 --> 04:42.000]  displacing all the garbage food and the price is dropping because of the market
[04:42.000 --> 04:46.800]  more people are coming in to produce it they talk about that in the memo that oh
[04:46.800 --> 04:50.080]  my god we can't give them any freedom this is right around the time they they
[04:50.080 --> 04:53.920]  lost the fairness doctrine to ban talk radio so we're gonna break that down
[04:53.920 --> 05:00.880]  today and tie it into the huge Bundy bombshells and more in the last 50
[05:00.880 --> 05:05.560]  years iodine has been phased out of our staple foods and replaced with the
[05:05.560 --> 05:11.240]  halogen bromine a practice now banned in nations around the world guess what
[05:11.240 --> 05:15.520]  else is in the halogen family fluoride ladies and gentlemen Alex Jones here in
[05:15.520 --> 05:21.000]  1924 the federal government did the right thing and encouraged salt producers to
[05:21.000 --> 05:26.520]  add iodine it's the good halogen on the periodic table and the results are on
[05:26.520 --> 05:31.880]  record reports documented a 15-point IQ increase in areas that had previously

[08:24.000 --> 08:29.680]  everyone should be asking themselves a very important question right now why
[08:29.680 --> 08:38.280]  do known admitted White House organs of propaganda directed by the White House
[08:38.280 --> 08:44.360]  and by former White House chiefs of staff and others why does that rotating
[08:44.360 --> 08:51.480]  door system focus more and more the majority of its time attacking Alex
[08:51.480 --> 09:01.440]  Jones Matt drudge WorldNet daily why do they do that they do that because we
[09:01.440 --> 09:06.960]  know their game plan we know how the world works and people have noticed
[09:06.960 --> 09:10.720]  that we know what we're talking about and that we understand the globalist
[09:10.720 --> 09:15.440]  program and that and that these people are not liberals these people are avowed
[09:15.440 --> 09:21.840]  authoritarians that use socialism as a tool of domestication and control and
[09:21.840 --> 09:29.440]  who themselves are fascist by any political yardstick and the dominant
[09:29.440 --> 09:34.840]  political party of the globalist in this country is the Democrats the
[09:34.840 --> 09:39.680]  Republicans are the loyal opposition working with the elite to make
[09:39.680 --> 09:43.840]  conservatives and libertarians and any other opposition feel like they've got
[09:43.840 --> 09:48.280]  somebody up there working for them so that they can never actually block the
[09:48.280 --> 09:54.080]  unpopular stuff that's happening but only water it down a little bit to to
[09:54.080 --> 09:59.360]  create the perception that we can still save the country by working through the
[09:59.360 --> 10:08.280]  current political system now that said when you see media matters openly
[10:08.280 --> 10:12.280]  publicly run by the White House then weekly meetings run by their former
[10:12.280 --> 10:16.640]  White House transition chief you are actually hearing what Obama and
[10:16.640 --> 10:23.240]  Hillary Clinton and the globalist and John Kerry and Diane Feinstein really
[10:23.240 --> 10:28.080]  have to say and because they're basically front people for the globalist
[10:28.080 --> 10:32.240]  you're hearing what the Davos group what the Bilderberg group what others are
[10:32.240 --> 10:37.400]  actually pitching now there's an article up on info wars.com that is
[10:37.400 --> 10:42.520]  linked in red that will put up on screen for viewers. MSNBC smears
[10:42.520 --> 10:49.480]  Bundy supporters as insurgents attacks info wars drudge.
[10:49.480 --> 10:54.440]  Host Chris Hayes who looks like another racial mad owl why do they all look the
[10:54.440 --> 11:01.880]  same it's just really weird laments the Alex Jonesification of the GOP now
[11:01.880 --> 11:06.240]  that's not what's really happening I would love to be able to get up here and
[11:06.240 --> 11:13.000]  toot my horn I guess just for the sake of largesse and ego but the truth is I've
[11:13.000 --> 11:17.640]  just been telling the truth for 19 years on air and now so much of it has
[11:17.640 --> 11:21.080]  come true because I was reading globalist battle plans that are public
[11:21.080 --> 11:25.240]  it was public the NSA spy on everything and 1996 it was in the
[11:25.240 --> 11:29.120]  telecommunications act it's public they secretly kill American citizens it's in

[11:38.280 --> 11:46.200]  born eco science it's not that I'm radical it's that I will cover the real
[11:46.200 --> 11:50.240]  radical garbage that's going on so let me explain what's happening here before
[11:50.240 --> 11:55.680]  I get into this and why it's so big if you're faced with something so
[11:55.680 --> 12:01.400]  incredibly radical so incredibly over the top so incredibly evil like two plus
[12:01.400 --> 12:06.680]  two equals five is being taught in public schools nationwide to first
[12:06.680 --> 12:10.440]  second and third graders that's been news for two years when you're faced with
[12:10.440 --> 12:15.640]  radical Newsweek covers that say the case for killing granny why death panels
[12:15.640 --> 12:21.880]  are good while they simultaneously deny they exist in the bill which is now law
[12:21.880 --> 12:28.720]  and call us cooks see when you're faced with that level of full spectrum lies
[12:28.720 --> 12:34.680]  and deceit while also throwing it in your face how do you respond to Peter
[12:34.680 --> 12:40.120]  Singer saying let parents kill their children up to age two how do you
[12:40.120 --> 12:48.280]  respond to the New York Times and the London Guardian calling for the arrest
[12:48.280 --> 12:52.280]  of anyone that disagrees with anthropogenic global warming or mammary
[12:52.280 --> 12:56.360]  global warming how do you respond to 53 million aborted babies how do you
[12:56.360 --> 13:02.640]  respond to 52% of blacks being aborted how do you respond to illegals being
[13:02.640 --> 13:05.800]  able to come here and get everything free including their babies born but then
[13:05.800 --> 13:11.000]  citizens can't get that how do you respond to tens of trillions of dollars
[13:11.000 --> 13:16.600]  stolen by offshore banks where we sign on to the foreign debt and then we're
[13:16.600 --> 13:21.200]  debt poppers and told how we were lazy and the very people we give the money
[13:21.200 --> 13:25.920]  then use the money to buy off all our politicians how do you respond to Warren
[13:25.920 --> 13:29.920]  Buffett being the biggest recipient of banker bailout money and the biggest
[13:29.920 --> 13:35.240]  public lobbyist spending over 300 million dollars look it up in the last six
[13:35.240 --> 13:42.360]  years promoting tax increases in TV ads print ads and underwriting ABC nightly

[14:06.360 --> 14:12.200]  attack they attack yours truly because they know ladies and gentlemen I've
[14:12.200 --> 14:15.960]  read the books they've written they think you're so stupid that you'll never go
[14:15.960 --> 14:19.920]  read them I've read their writings I know who they are I know who their
[14:19.920 --> 14:27.560]  minions are I know what their game plan is the truth is up until about a year or
[14:27.560 --> 14:31.800]  two ago they would tell the truth in policy papers what they were up to
[14:31.800 --> 14:35.880]  Gary Hart would write in Huffington Post we stage terror attacks and we may
[14:35.880 --> 14:41.720]  stage another one to launch a war against Iran I mean the list goes on and
[14:41.720 --> 14:46.640]  on they operate out in the open and have literally hundreds of books written by
[14:46.640 --> 14:50.840]  top futurist saying they're gonna build a world government and exterminate the
[14:50.840 --> 14:54.560]  majority of the population but first dumb us down and have us asked for our
[14:54.560 --> 14:59.060]  extermination I mean I've read stuff from the 20s and 30s about how they had
[14:59.060 --> 15:06.080]  to get children out of people's arms into baskets and into crates and into
[15:06.080 --> 15:11.920]  cradles and cribs to break the human connection to them because they found
[15:11.920 --> 15:16.600]  when they removed baby rats from their mothers they were addled stupid fearful
[15:16.600 --> 15:21.080]  and pathetic I mean the children don't get mothers milk their brains are a
[15:21.080 --> 15:25.560]  third smaller on average when given formula I mean there's a reason the
[15:25.560 --> 15:32.720]  public's dumb and cowardly and weak I was hanging on my parents neck like a
[15:32.720 --> 15:37.120]  monkey I slept with them I sat there and watched everything they did I have
[15:37.120 --> 15:42.040]  memories when I was like a year and a half old I'm realizing I had a symbiotic
[15:42.040 --> 15:45.320]  relationship with my parents and fearing something would happen to them
[15:45.320 --> 15:50.600]  because they were my my biological robot that did things for me kids supposed
[15:50.600 --> 15:53.560]  to be hanging like a monkey off their parents neck watching everything
[15:53.560 --> 16:00.200]  developing into a seriously smart aggressive creature instead you look at
[16:00.200 --> 16:04.320]  all these people their little kids the SWAT teams all of them are trying to be
[16:04.320 --> 16:08.280]  men trying to find their mother trying to find their father trying to find their
[16:08.280 --> 16:12.640]  tribe that they have biologically and now all the science is coming out and
[16:12.640 --> 16:17.040]  major universities I saw one out of Princeton just the other day another
[16:17.040 --> 16:22.360]  out of Calgary up in Canada and the top professors are going epigenetics it's
[16:22.360 --> 16:26.200]  incredible we need to be held and we need to be taught we need to go through
[16:26.200 --> 16:29.560]  things when we're a kid so that it triggers our epigenetics and boost the
[16:29.560 --> 16:34.200]  IQ and they're going I can't believe that everything we do is to lower IQ and
[16:34.200 --> 16:39.840]  to lower human development and accessing our real programming but you just think
[16:39.840 --> 16:45.320]  you just discovered that this year scientist the new adulthood is at 25
[16:45.320 --> 16:51.400]  it's about to be 30 these people we have a baby isn't held by their parents if a
[16:51.400 --> 16:56.760]  baby isn't given the fat in the mother's milk the baby releases hormones and
[16:56.760 --> 17:03.800]  chemicals and then activates genes this is on record to where they live in fear
[17:03.800 --> 17:07.960]  and are totally cowardly and have no idea what planet they're on and then have
[17:07.960 --> 17:11.720]  to be given antidepressants because they're so freaked out oh when your
[17:11.720 --> 17:15.720]  11 year old daughter has anxiety because she's got zits for the first time it goes
[17:15.720 --> 17:20.440]  into puberty it isn't go through the crisis deal with it learn how to deal
[17:20.440 --> 17:24.160]  with it no it's drug your daughter with serotonin reuptake inhibitors and
[17:24.160 --> 17:29.880]  and stuff like that psychotropics when your son gets beat up for the first time
[17:29.880 --> 17:33.400]  or beat somebody up as they start a fight the answer is drug them instead of
[17:33.400 --> 17:38.440]  giving them a medal you're not allowed to go through any of the rights of passage
[17:38.440 --> 17:43.480]  and I biologically realized this myself a long time ago because it's the rights

[34:02.280 --> 34:06.200]  in to the documents that have recently come out
[34:06.200 --> 34:12.600]  uh where bill clinton as early as 1993 when he first got in office
[34:12.600 --> 34:16.120]  they were putting out 300 plus page reports on how to shut down
[34:16.120 --> 34:19.400]  any free speech in america and they actually say
[34:19.400 --> 34:23.960]  we don't want voices out there we don't control
[34:23.960 --> 34:30.440]  and this is published on bill clinton's own presidential library website
[34:32.360 --> 34:38.520]  we're going to be going over that it shows exactly who these people are
[34:38.520 --> 34:45.960]  now who are these very people today the current clinton's that run obama as

[35:25.000 --> 35:30.520]  now long story short here ladies and gentlemen this is epic history happening
[35:30.520 --> 35:32.600]  right now and when i get up in the morning and see
[35:32.600 --> 35:36.360]  that poll watson's written this article and i watch this news piece i did not
[35:36.360 --> 35:39.720]  get happy for me personally
[35:39.720 --> 35:45.960]  my flesh or my worldly side went man you better watch it because when you've
[35:45.960 --> 35:50.280]  got ruthless mafia criminals like the attorney general bill clinton hillary
[35:50.280 --> 35:55.480]  clinton obama their frontman literally with you in
[35:55.480 --> 35:59.960]  their gun sites it's not fun so pray for us
[35:59.960 --> 36:03.640]  there's no telling what they're going to pull and they've pulled plenty they've
[36:03.640 --> 36:07.320]  put fbi disinformation operatives on us they've
[36:07.320 --> 36:11.160]  sent the white supremacists after us they've every time cops get killed they
[36:11.160 --> 36:14.360]  plant evidence that the person's a follower of mine and we have to go prove
[36:14.360 --> 36:20.200]  it isn't i mean they really want to bring me down
[36:20.200 --> 36:23.800]  and they want to bring down matt drudge obviously
[36:23.800 --> 36:27.960]  target number one and they want to bring down um people like
[36:27.960 --> 36:30.680]  world net daily i'm gonna say this again
[36:30.680 --> 36:33.960]  i've never really attacked blend back except when he attacks me
[36:33.960 --> 36:37.400]  or rush limbaugh or sean hannity or any of them because here's the deal when the
[36:37.400 --> 36:40.920]  globalists take over they will go after those people
[36:40.920 --> 36:44.840]  even if they've been part of a corrupt gop establishment
[36:44.840 --> 36:49.320]  they're going to extinct that just because the gop stood for pro-life
[36:49.320 --> 36:55.080]  and stood for low taxes and stood for lands rights and family rights it will be
[36:55.080 --> 37:00.120]  eradicated that's their goal number one
[37:00.120 --> 37:02.840]  and then they'll split the democratic party into different parties and
[37:02.840 --> 37:05.720]  continue the Balkanization that way they'll have a racial side of the
[37:05.720 --> 37:09.880]  democratic party and then kind of a economic side
[37:09.880 --> 37:13.240]  and they've already said that's their plan they do the same social engine
[37:13.240 --> 37:17.720]  the same social engineering in europe and they do it by saying they're not
[37:17.720 --> 37:21.240]  radical while pushing the most radical anti-human ideas
[37:21.240 --> 37:26.520]  and then demonizing mainline human values
[37:26.520 --> 37:30.840]  and it's called the overton window you guys put up on screen definition of the
[37:30.840 --> 37:34.680]  overton window thank you and the overton window is
[37:34.680 --> 37:38.280]  basically a sociology idea that i agree with it's a way of
[37:38.280 --> 37:41.720]  looking at it as an allegory of imagine a political window
[37:41.720 --> 37:45.480]  that you're looking out of that that you accept
[37:45.480 --> 37:48.520]  let me just read the definition the overton window is political theory that
[37:48.520 --> 37:52.360]  describes a narrow window the range of ideas the public will accept
[37:52.360 --> 37:56.600]  on this theory an ideas political viability depends mainly on whether
[37:56.600 --> 37:59.560]  it fails or falls within the narrow window
[37:59.560 --> 38:03.080]  rather than on politicians individual preferences
[38:03.080 --> 38:06.840]  it is named for its originator joseph p overton
[38:06.840 --> 38:12.680]  1960 a former vice president of the center for public policy at any given
[38:12.680 --> 38:17.000]  moment the window includes a range of policies considered politically
[38:17.000 --> 38:19.960]  acceptable in the current climate of public opinion
[38:19.960 --> 38:23.000]  which a politician can recommend without being considered
[38:23.000 --> 38:27.320]  too extreme to gain and keep the public's office now
[38:27.320 --> 38:31.080]  what the winehouse does is they have all their operatives and czars
[38:31.080 --> 38:34.600]  and and and minions come out and say we should kill babies up to age two we
[38:34.600 --> 38:37.720]  should kill old people yes we're going to bankrupt healthcare
[38:37.720 --> 38:40.920]  and bring in death panels yes we think men are inherently bad
[38:40.920 --> 38:44.200]  and all sex is rape yes world government's good
[38:44.200 --> 38:47.400]  yes we want to reduce the population down to 100 million
[38:47.400 --> 38:49.880]  yes we're bringing in planetary government putting fluoride in the water to
[38:49.880 --> 38:53.640]  brain damage you yes we're going to teach two plus two equals five
[38:53.640 --> 38:57.640]  yes we want force inoculations those are the surrogates
[38:57.640 --> 39:01.480]  they're there to move the overton window over into eugenics
[39:01.480 --> 39:04.920]  ultra hit larry inland and then call it liberal
[39:04.920 --> 39:10.120]  call the cyanide laced koolaid mother's milk okay
[39:10.120 --> 39:14.120]  i mean they're meant to go on tv on msnbc and a promo that runs every
[39:14.120 --> 39:17.880]  hour and say your kids belong to us when you destroy the idea
[39:17.880 --> 39:21.320]  that your kids belong to parents they belong to the state
[39:21.320 --> 39:24.600]  and they say openly we're going to destroy the idea
[39:24.600 --> 39:29.720]  of the family and then call that liberal total
[39:29.720 --> 39:34.200]  authoritarian sci-fi level evil that's they're not on the left these people
[39:34.200 --> 39:38.280]  are in the pit of hell i see things mainly as a circle the black hole of
[39:38.280 --> 39:41.800]  tyranny at the middle that is a political gravity
[39:41.800 --> 39:44.760]  that sucks in all the other individually
[39:44.760 --> 39:49.960]  truly diverse ideas that form a renaissance society
[39:49.960 --> 39:54.360]  a truly illuminated society the illuminati seeks to create darkness for
[39:54.360 --> 39:57.000]  everyone else but they're illuminated with the knowledge
[39:57.000 --> 40:00.840]  and you're basically blind see they're a counterfeit illuminati
[40:00.840 --> 40:06.280]  they're a counterfeit christ god eliminates the devil creates a black
[40:06.280 --> 40:09.960]  sunshine that only his people can see in but even
[40:09.960 --> 40:12.840]  they are blind to a certain level they're only allowed to operate in an evil
[40:12.840 --> 40:15.080]  spectrum i mean you're getting the deep knowledge
[40:15.080 --> 40:18.200]  here i hope you're listening right now
[40:18.200 --> 40:21.960]  this is the philosophy that they understand they've chosen evil because
[40:21.960 --> 40:26.440]  it will give them temporal power on this planet
[40:26.440 --> 40:30.760]  while they lose their soul and by soul if you don't believe in the soul
[40:30.760 --> 40:36.680]  they lose their true free human intellect they lose the incredible heights
[40:36.680 --> 40:40.040]  of free expression but again they label it as
[40:40.040 --> 40:42.920]  something good when it's something bad so
[40:42.920 --> 40:46.280]  everything in these msnbc and cnn pieces is
[40:46.280 --> 40:49.720]  accepted mainline politics they say it over and over again
[40:49.720 --> 40:54.600]  normal politics you know should your child be taught death
[40:54.600 --> 40:59.960]  education at five or at eleven well all death education has been proven to
[40:59.960 --> 41:02.680]  increase suicide look at the numbers all-time highs in
[41:02.680 --> 41:05.880]  youth the drugings cause that g is there a correlation
[41:05.880 --> 41:09.320]  of course there is is separating kids from their parents giving them
[41:09.320 --> 41:12.520]  formula meant to shrink the size of their brain development
[41:12.520 --> 41:15.880]  and makes them add a little cowardly creatures
[41:15.880 --> 41:21.080]  you know is that a good idea everything they do is to hurt you
[41:21.080 --> 41:26.440]  everything they do is to rob freedom from you and the promethean fire
[41:26.440 --> 41:30.920]  these people are an abomination they are a desolation
[41:30.920 --> 41:34.440]  there is no way to describe how evil they are so everything they do is to keep
[41:34.440 --> 41:37.720]  the overton window as far towards evil
[41:37.720 --> 41:41.960]  as far down the black hole as they can while demonizing any free thinker
[41:41.960 --> 41:47.320]  outside of that paradigm and trying to flog you and beat you over the head if
[41:47.320 --> 41:50.760]  you associate with anyone else i mean when we have people from the left on
[41:50.760 --> 41:54.200]  here they really get upset when we have
[41:54.200 --> 41:59.080]  muslims on or we have feminist on or we or we reach across to people
[41:59.080 --> 42:03.160]  when we get past the labels they go into absolute
[42:03.160 --> 42:07.160]  chicken with a head cut off mode because they need to keep you on a very narrow
[42:07.160 --> 42:12.120]  reservation that's continually radicalized
[42:12.120 --> 42:17.240]  racing away from common sense and so they're afraid because they know what
[42:17.240 --> 42:20.360]  i'm doing i'm not apologizing i'm not playing the game of being
[42:20.360 --> 42:23.480]  reasonable i go on these shows and i say you are the
[42:23.480 --> 42:27.000]  enemy working for offshore banks to deindustrialize this country
[42:27.000 --> 42:31.800]  disarmus and enslave us you're the enemy you're on notice i see you
[42:31.800 --> 42:36.040]  end of discussion and because it's true almost everyone recognizes the truth
[42:36.040 --> 42:39.160]  because you already subconsciously have a very powerful mind
[42:39.160 --> 42:43.240]  and your subconscious recognizes it and in your gut that's your subconscious
[42:43.240 --> 42:48.200]  says this man speaks the truth so see they can't allow a debate with someone
[42:48.200 --> 42:54.600]  that just cuts through it all it doesn't play along with the larger game
[42:54.600 --> 42:58.440]  so that's what they're up to here and so everything they do
[42:58.440 --> 43:02.280]  is to teach you that you don't have any power and that you could only have power
[43:02.280 --> 43:08.200]  but being part of a collective that is their projection their idea
[43:09.000 --> 43:12.440]  and so they come out in a 15 minute report the whole thing's up on info
[43:12.440 --> 43:15.080]  wars.com
[43:15.240 --> 43:21.960]  and they demonize anyone that dares stand up against tyranny and the
[43:21.960 --> 43:25.320]  idea of armed citizens you got the feds with police dogs
[43:25.320 --> 43:29.080]  you got the feds tasering people saying no free speech in an entire county area
[43:29.080 --> 43:33.320]  but in two little pens you've got them spending three million dollars on it
[43:33.320 --> 43:36.920]  you've got 200 vehicles 400 agents we now learn
[43:36.920 --> 43:40.920]  they're shooting the cattle illegally breaking the water pipes federal judge
[43:40.920 --> 43:44.200]  says it's part of a criminal conspiracy to run everyone out of business
[43:44.200 --> 43:49.080]  52 families are gone one family's left the image of them like Tiananmen Square
[43:49.080 --> 43:53.400]  beating people up citizens respond they come most of them without guns but some
[43:53.400 --> 43:56.040]  with guns and say if you're going to shoot us go
[43:56.040 --> 44:00.040]  ahead and do it we're going to then fight back against you
[44:00.040 --> 44:03.160]  and the image of cowboys and men women and children
[44:03.160 --> 44:06.440]  walking across the line with a loudspeaker saying we will shoot you
[44:06.440 --> 44:09.480]  was like east germans walking towards machine guns
[44:09.480 --> 44:14.120]  in the fall of eastern germany of the soviet nightmare
[44:14.120 --> 44:20.280]  east germany and crossing over the berlin wall it it's that level of people
[44:20.280 --> 44:25.880]  engaged in real civil disobedience against dehumanization and wickedness
[44:25.880 --> 44:29.640]  and they can't have that so they've got to have harry reid you know they're
[44:29.640 --> 44:33.320]  upset that the other senator is saying that this is patriotism
[44:33.320 --> 44:37.640]  because if that spreads if that happens
[44:37.640 --> 44:40.760]  and if the public ever realizes wow drudge has like
[44:40.760 --> 44:44.200]  10 million people visited side of day alex jones has over a million and a
[44:44.200 --> 44:48.600]  half to his sites and a million to his facebook and twitter and
[44:48.600 --> 44:52.200]  three million terrestrial listeners every day 15 million a week and
[44:52.200 --> 44:56.200]  msnbc has 500 000 why are they setting the parameters
[44:56.200 --> 44:59.560]  why are they controlling the debate alex jones doesn't tell me what to think
[44:59.560 --> 45:03.560]  he says what he thinks shows his evidence just tells it like it is
[45:03.560 --> 45:06.840]  i don't put on an act here i don't talk real slow and talk to you like you're a
[45:06.840 --> 45:09.400]  five-year-old
[45:11.800 --> 45:16.200]  the fact is msnbc is plunging in the ratings
[45:16.200 --> 45:19.640]  we are exploding in the ratings
[45:20.120 --> 45:24.280]  the truth is they're dying and and they tried to suppress a free press in this
[45:24.280 --> 45:27.080]  country they tried to stop talk radio being legalized where you could just go
[45:27.080 --> 45:29.800]  on the air and say what you think and take calls because they don't want you
[45:29.800 --> 45:32.520]  having a platform
[45:34.200 --> 45:37.320]  the only thing going up is msnbc's web rating for the skill a lot lower than
[45:37.320 --> 45:41.080]  ours their actual physical ratings in tv are down 24
[45:41.080 --> 45:44.760]  percent in one year you type in the headline msnbc
[45:44.760 --> 45:49.880]  ratings drop 24 percent in 2013 we'll put that on screen for you
[45:49.880 --> 45:53.160]  along with all the other globalist operations
[45:53.160 --> 45:56.760]  we're gonna skip this network break i gotta quit doing it but i can't open
[45:56.760 --> 46:01.960]  i want to get to this video in this audio now that we're analyzing here
[46:01.960 --> 46:07.160]  because they now understand
[46:07.560 --> 46:12.760]  that they're in free fall they now understand
[46:12.760 --> 46:16.200]  that the idea of freedom is getting out there so they want to brand
[46:16.200 --> 46:19.320]  the idea of libertarianism constitutionalism
[46:19.320 --> 46:24.360]  new renaissance space exploration humanity unifying globally around free
[46:24.360 --> 46:28.840]  will not around autocratic forced systems
[46:28.840 --> 46:32.680]  they're scared to death of real liberalism and so they want to say
[46:32.680 --> 46:36.040]  i'm gop so that all the democrats get the word
[46:36.040 --> 46:39.480]  oh i don't want to go to a tea party
[46:39.480 --> 46:42.360]  i don't want to be around those racists i don't want to be around that alex
[46:42.360 --> 46:46.520]  jones who msnbc says is deeply racist and then shows no proof or behind the
[46:46.520 --> 46:50.120]  boston bombing and shows no proof why are they so scared of us because they
[46:50.120 --> 46:54.280]  know that we're not putting out talking points we're putting out hardcore
[46:54.280 --> 46:58.520]  historical analysis with passion people are listening they're looking it up
[46:58.520 --> 47:02.040]  they're finding out i'm accurate and then more they're finding out their own
[47:02.040 --> 47:06.680]  information and they can see with their nsa systems
[47:06.680 --> 47:11.400]  how fast liberty is rising and they're hitting the panic button
[47:11.400 --> 47:14.280]  now also in this piece that and then we're going to play it
[47:14.280 --> 47:20.200]  also in this piece if you listen to it
[47:20.760 --> 47:25.400]  you notice they go 9 11 truth or alex jones knowing that the republicans and
[47:25.400 --> 47:29.480]  democrats attack 9 11 truthers under bush so they also want to make
[47:29.480 --> 47:33.080]  republicans go who i better not support anything alex jones does he's not
[47:33.080 --> 47:36.120]  loving truth or folks the government's been caught running al qaeda all over

[47:38.920 --> 47:43.160]  that was in the news yesterday there are real radical muslims my point is
[47:43.160 --> 47:46.040]  they're being allowed to operate so that when they attack us
[47:46.040 --> 47:50.360]  our liberties can be taken and they just want to boil that down and say oh
[47:50.360 --> 47:52.920]  you know he says the firefighters blew up the towers
[47:52.920 --> 47:57.080]  that's that's something they've said on fox and cnn i never said that
[47:57.080 --> 48:00.680]  they will they want you to to be divided they want conservatives divided away
[48:00.680 --> 48:03.000]  from me they want liberals divided away from me
[48:03.000 --> 48:06.680]  they want everybody because they don't want people understanding the unifying
[48:06.680 --> 48:10.760]  message of being aware of the social engineering
[48:10.760 --> 48:16.200]  globalist that are sitting on top of us using psychology psychiatry
[48:16.200 --> 48:22.200]  advertising propaganda spin psyops product placement propaganda placement
[48:22.200 --> 48:26.200]  behavior placement you know i coined the term propaganda placement and they now
[48:26.200 --> 48:31.000]  use it they call it behavior placement you don't have to i'm
[48:31.000 --> 48:34.840]  here telling you the magic trick is fixed and i'm telling you how he does the
[48:34.840 --> 48:37.080]  magic trick and and you're like a little kid new
[48:37.080 --> 48:41.160]  listeners going oh no it's real no it's not
[48:41.160 --> 48:44.680]  there's a compartment in that table where he reaches in and then there's a
[48:44.680 --> 48:47.800]  compartment the top of the hat and he reaches through with the spring and
[48:47.800 --> 48:52.280]  grabs a rabbit out of the box under it you're like well i can't see it i
[48:52.280 --> 48:54.920]  look i'm telling you there's a rabbit in that box
[48:54.920 --> 48:58.920]  go kick the box over there's a rabbit in it and they go oh your conspiracy
[48:58.920 --> 49:01.720]  theorist there's no rabbits in that box he's
[49:01.720 --> 49:05.240]  magically materializing it no i'm not the conspiracy theorist
[49:05.240 --> 49:09.960]  i'm telling you how these criminals are engaged in an open conspiracy against
[49:09.960 --> 49:14.120]  you and they're so weak they've got to dumb you down from birth
[49:14.120 --> 49:18.680]  so that they can manage you instead of empowering humanity
[49:18.680 --> 49:21.640]  now i'm going to go to this piece we're skipping this network break station
[49:21.640 --> 49:25.160]  should not play ads over this because because this is a network break this
[49:25.160 --> 49:27.960]  cost us a lot of money to skip these ads but i do it
[49:27.960 --> 49:31.320]  because airtime is so precious let's go ahead
[49:31.320 --> 49:36.200]  and go to the msnbc piece and i'll stop it here in there and analyze it but i
[49:36.200 --> 49:40.760]  basically already broken it down they are so scared they're saying oh my gosh
[49:40.760 --> 49:46.360]  you p a ha ha you're discredited because more and more of you are really
[49:46.360 --> 49:49.880]  saying what you think more and more of you are talking you know like radicals
[49:49.880 --> 49:53.080]  more and more of you are being insurgents more and more and you are being
[49:53.080 --> 49:56.600]  terrorist oh no oh no we're supposed to stage a revolution
[49:56.600 --> 49:59.800]  ourselves against you and when you fight back as counter-revolutionaries
[49:59.800 --> 50:02.760]  we're supposed to call you terrorist you're not supposed to get on the
[50:02.760 --> 50:06.440]  offense with the moral high ground and call us out as criminals for fast
[50:06.440 --> 50:08.440]  and furious and Benghazi and all the rest of it
[50:08.440 --> 50:11.400]  you're not supposed to restore the republic you're supposed to let us take
[50:11.400 --> 50:13.880]  your kids you're supposed to let us break up your families
[50:13.880 --> 50:17.160]  you're supposed to let us feed you gmo you're supposed to let us have the moral
[50:17.160 --> 50:19.720]  high ground you're supposed to let us lecture you all day
[50:19.720 --> 50:23.320]  you're supposed to let us be the boss and do what we say don't listen to this
[50:23.320 --> 50:28.120]  one Texan who tells you you don't have to follow them
[50:28.840 --> 50:32.360]  and then they try to patronize you and say you're following me
[50:32.360 --> 50:36.120]  this is not the jonesification of the world this is survival instinct
[50:36.120 --> 50:40.040]  kicking in and you know in your gut but also
[50:40.040 --> 50:43.400]  intellectually i'm real
[50:43.880 --> 50:47.320]  i'm real ladies and gentlemen red blooded big heart
[50:47.320 --> 50:51.080]  pumps blood i don't like being a slave i take it
[50:51.080 --> 50:54.760]  personal i'm committed i don't have any fear of these people
[50:54.760 --> 51:00.120]  only have fear that i'm too weak to to to really smash into the enemy
[51:00.120 --> 51:03.800]  all i want is to bring this scum down and see humanity go to the next level
[51:03.800 --> 51:08.120]  that's all i want and i know we're gonna beat them
[51:08.120 --> 51:11.400]  and i love you and i love those of you that stand and work
[51:11.400 --> 51:14.200]  and and bust your ass in this system they're trying to make as hard as they
[51:14.200 --> 51:17.880]  can to break up your families and and and shut down our society they're
[51:17.880 --> 51:21.800]  waging war on us but when humans know they're under attack they get stronger
[51:21.800 --> 51:25.000]  if you don't know you're under attack you get weaker and learn to live under
[51:25.000 --> 51:27.320]  the slavery but when you know you're under attack
[51:27.320 --> 51:31.000]  it only makes you stronger so admit you're under attack
[51:31.000 --> 51:34.840]  and then take action against the enemy let's go to the enemy transmission
[51:34.840 --> 51:40.120]  directly from the white house directed at the gop and the real libertarian tea
[51:40.120 --> 51:44.520]  party that is taking it over they call us an infection
[51:44.520 --> 51:48.680]  no ladies and gentlemen we are the cure here it is
[51:48.680 --> 51:52.040]  heller says these men and women are patriots
[51:52.040 --> 51:57.320]  so does the website info wars a paranoid online haven run by alex jones
[51:57.320 --> 52:01.960]  jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theorist whose stories often make their
[52:01.960 --> 52:05.640]  way from his website info wars where on any day you can find
[52:05.640 --> 52:10.280]  headlines about vaccines mass fluoridation and the 9-11 cover-up
[52:10.280 --> 52:15.080]  into the so-called mainstream gop establishment alex jones was a champion
[52:15.080 --> 52:18.840]  of cliven bundy from the very beginning because he's saying he'll do whatever
[52:18.840 --> 52:23.720]  he has to uh to not be uh you know have his grazing rights stolen
[52:23.720 --> 52:27.400]  by these pirates drudge elevated the story and it made its way
[52:27.400 --> 52:32.600]  onto fox news's airwaves brannon is a connoisseur of a wide range of jones
[52:32.600 --> 52:37.320]  backed conspiracies from obama care as socialist plot to vaccines to
[52:37.320 --> 52:41.320]  something called agenda 21 someone who is well acquainted with the
[52:41.320 --> 52:45.480]  rights favorite conspiracy theories kentucky senator ran paul i'm pleased
[52:45.480 --> 52:48.120]  to be here to support a fellow physician to support
[52:48.120 --> 52:51.480]  greg brannon ran paul is also a fan of alex jones
[52:51.480 --> 52:56.120]  he's been a guest on jones's radio show over the years paul apparently takes his
[52:56.120 --> 52:59.800]  cues from jones on fringe obsessions like bilderberg
[52:59.800 --> 53:04.200]  a yearly meeting of people that jones believes secretly run the world
[53:04.200 --> 53:07.640]  do you know anything about the bilderberg group only what i've learned from alex
[53:07.640 --> 53:10.760]  jones do you know for the people who don't
[53:10.760 --> 53:13.720]  know what's going on can you tell people who are the bilderberg group if you
[53:13.720 --> 53:16.760]  feel comfortable doing so yeah well i'm not probably the world's expert on it
[53:16.760 --> 53:21.320]  but i think it's people who get together who are very wealthy people who i think
[53:21.320 --> 53:25.320]  manipulate and use government to their own personal advantage
[53:25.320 --> 53:28.840]  for more and more republicans if you're not out on the fringe
[53:28.840 --> 53:32.840]  you're not in the party's mainstream i've actually seen this
[53:32.840 --> 53:36.200]  discussed in all sorts of corners of the right wing media and not just in the
[53:36.200 --> 53:39.720]  most conspiratorial circles that the reason
[53:39.720 --> 53:43.960]  that the blm came for cliven bundy's ranch is so that you could help the
[53:43.960 --> 53:47.320]  chinese build a solar plant on that land um
[53:47.320 --> 53:51.160]  do you want to back it up a little bit and again the full piece is up on
[53:51.160 --> 53:57.240]  info wars dot com again in the blm's website it said as an environmental
[53:57.240 --> 54:01.400]  easement next to the corridor that's how it works that they get to use one area
[54:01.400 --> 54:04.040]  then they have to have an area that's an easement that's not being used
[54:04.040 --> 54:09.800]  we're going to use the 600 000 acres of clive bundy's rangeland
[54:09.800 --> 54:12.680]  now they took it off the blm website they took it off the google site we have
[54:12.680 --> 54:16.600]  it saved scribb as it saved they do not deny it's real
[54:16.600 --> 54:21.160]  they just come out and say that you know there's nothing going on with harry
[54:21.160 --> 54:25.560]  reid's son rory reid is on record in over a hundred
[54:25.560 --> 54:29.720]  publications roiders ap you name it as a scandal
[54:29.720 --> 54:35.880]  that his dad got the deal with the chinese who put him on the company board
[54:35.880 --> 54:40.600]  but they prey on the msnbc audience and sit there and say
[54:40.600 --> 54:44.120]  you know what's even crazier they claim you're with the chinese in the land
[54:44.120 --> 54:47.160]  grab
[54:47.160 --> 54:50.360]  tell me another one tell me bill clinton lies next
[54:50.360 --> 54:53.720]  that's even better tell me tell me they ship guns in the mexico to play in the
[54:53.720 --> 54:57.640]  second amendment tell me tell me obama care
[54:57.640 --> 55:01.000]  is increasing prices and you can keep your doctor oh you are that you built
[55:01.000 --> 55:05.320]  your business oh that's even fun here
[55:05.320 --> 55:09.080]  oh i'm sorry let's go back to it i've actually seen this
[55:09.080 --> 55:12.440]  discussed in all sorts of corners of the right wing media and not just in the
[55:12.440 --> 55:15.960]  most conspiratorial circles that the reason
[55:15.960 --> 55:20.200]  that the blm came for cliven bundy's ranch is so that you could help the
[55:20.200 --> 55:25.240]  chinese build a solar plant on that land um do you want to respond to that
[55:25.240 --> 55:28.680]  allegation it's ridiculous that'd be a great story
[55:28.680 --> 55:31.880]  if it were true i don't represent anybody chinese or otherwise it has an
[55:31.880 --> 55:34.840]  interest in developing anything on that land
[55:34.840 --> 55:38.840]  i don't know what he was saying hit pause hit pause that land is listed in the
[55:38.840 --> 55:42.520]  documents as the environmental easement you notice he said he's a lawyer
[55:42.520 --> 55:45.400]  he goes i'll represent the chinese or anybody else
[55:45.400 --> 55:49.080]  on issues with that land back at up 10 seconds
[55:49.080 --> 55:53.640]  this is why they go alex jones got caught lying again not 1.6 billion
[55:53.640 --> 55:59.400]  it was 23 million bullets alex and they do one line item of all the stuff that
[55:59.400 --> 56:04.440]  was 1.6 billion now 2.6 or more remember there's no drones either
[56:04.440 --> 56:07.320]  in the skies alex jones lied about that
[56:07.320 --> 56:11.720]  there's no tax on in obama care for small businesses of $5,000 per employee
[56:11.720 --> 56:15.560]  even though it's hitting us this year matt drudge says he's gonna pay the fine
[56:15.560 --> 56:19.000]  he's a liar folks there's no there's no fees even though they're setting up the
[56:19.000 --> 56:23.560]  irs to take them let's go back to him lying to you
[56:23.560 --> 56:28.200]  with a cheshire grah cheshire cat grin confidence game
[56:28.200 --> 56:32.520]  with the male version of racial matter here it is allegation
[56:32.520 --> 56:35.560]  it's ridiculous that'd be a great story if it were true i don't represent
[56:35.560 --> 56:39.160]  anybody chinese or otherwise it has an interest in developing anything on that
[56:39.160 --> 56:41.880]  land i don't know what he was thinking you know
[56:41.880 --> 56:46.520]  he tends to be a reasonable guy supported immigration reform he supported
[56:46.520 --> 56:50.840]  an extension of unemployment insurance maybe he just had a bad day last friday
[56:50.840 --> 56:55.640]  but i think those were unfortunate comments and anything that is said that
[56:55.640 --> 57:00.840]  gives credence to those kind of ideas i think is is misplaced what about your
[57:00.840 --> 57:03.320]  father calling the folks are domestic terrorists there's been a lot of
[57:03.320 --> 57:07.240]  backlash over that that that phrasey ology for him seemed to me
[57:07.240 --> 57:10.840]  a bit hyperbolic what's what do you think of that
[57:10.840 --> 57:14.440]  well if my job was to respond and comment on everything my dad
[57:14.440 --> 57:17.480]  said i'd have another full-time job so i'm gonna decline
[57:17.480 --> 57:21.560]  oh really request no i don't want daddy i would say though that anybody that
[57:21.560 --> 57:25.400]  looks at that that situation would realize that
[57:25.400 --> 57:28.600]  that what those people are doing is simply inappropriate in america if you
[57:28.600 --> 57:31.320]  don't agree with the government you can't point
[57:31.320 --> 57:34.840]  well they tried to come out with signs and you tasered them and beat them up

[01:01:03.800 --> 01:01:06.680]  parents and kids and uh so i guess it's kind of the
[01:01:06.680 --> 01:01:10.200]  point of the spear point of the star how do you say point of the spear in
[01:01:10.200 --> 01:01:16.120]  spanish that'd be good go ahead and jump on the mic

[01:01:20.760 --> 01:01:26.360]  we're looking it up you guys need to know how to say spear in spanish

[01:01:29.720 --> 01:01:36.200]  in spear is punta de lanza well yeah i didn't even knew that now that you say it
[01:01:36.200 --> 01:01:39.640]  hey anyways side issue we're gonna open the phones up in the next segment
[01:01:39.640 --> 01:01:43.080]  get into some other news but i want to finish when we come back this is a short
[01:01:43.080 --> 01:01:47.240]  segment with the control of the media look i'm
[01:01:47.240 --> 01:01:50.840]  nothing really that special folks i've studied tyranny studied history i know
[01:01:50.840 --> 01:01:53.720]  how tyranny operates because i've read so many history books it
[01:01:53.720 --> 01:01:56.360]  repeats itself those that don't know history are doomed to repeat it i
[01:01:56.360 --> 01:02:00.120]  forget who said that but it's certainly true
[01:02:00.120 --> 01:02:03.160]  who did say those that don't know history are doomed to repeat it was that
[01:02:03.160 --> 01:02:07.640]  lord actin or did he say power corrupts an absolute power tends to corrupt
[01:02:07.640 --> 01:02:15.320]  absolutely that's the actual quote but we are the tip of the spear
[01:02:15.320 --> 01:02:20.920]  the tip of the lance and the system doesn't like it
[01:02:20.920 --> 01:02:24.280]  but it shows how powerless they are when good people stand up
[01:02:24.280 --> 01:02:27.560]  when you realize that clinton was deathly afraid of the internet
[01:02:27.560 --> 01:02:31.960]  when joseph farrah was first using it in 1993
[01:02:31.960 --> 01:02:36.040]  and matt drudge was developing his internet list using email
[01:02:36.040 --> 01:02:40.200]  they were already watching them hatefully then
[01:02:40.200 --> 01:02:43.720]  knowing that they were planning a criminal takeover it's edmund burke
[01:02:43.720 --> 01:02:47.640]  those who don't know history are doomed to repeat it
[01:02:47.640 --> 01:02:51.880]  and so we're here simply pointing out that we're going down a very authoritarian
[01:02:51.880 --> 01:02:55.640]  very tyrannical road and we need to stand up against it and be
[01:02:55.640 --> 01:03:02.040]  aware of it
[01:03:02.040 --> 01:03:06.200]  i mean there's a bunch of new news but the ranch is a microcosm of government
[01:03:06.200 --> 01:03:10.360]  oppression hypocrisy and tyranny that we look into and see our own
[01:03:10.360 --> 01:03:15.240]  reflection as a society in and that's why it resonates and that's why
[01:03:15.240 --> 01:03:18.520]  the system doesn't know what to do because you know what they say in the
[01:03:18.520 --> 01:03:20.840]  movie ants i want to come in with that intro if we can
[01:03:20.840 --> 01:03:26.440]  if you let one ant stand up they might all stand up
[01:03:26.440 --> 01:03:29.880]  they want to tell you you're worthless they want to tell you that
[01:03:29.880 --> 01:03:33.720]  that your words against them won't be heard and that you don't have power
[01:03:33.720 --> 01:03:39.800]  and that resistance is futile it's all words mr wordsworth
[01:03:39.800 --> 01:03:43.480]  the twilight zone intro we have will play that at the bottom of the hour
[01:03:43.480 --> 01:03:49.640]  and the truth is i'm only one guy who 22 years ago
[01:03:49.640 --> 01:03:53.720]  got out of high school and was going to community college
[01:03:53.720 --> 01:03:57.720]  and knew anti-american propaganda anti-freedom when i heard it
[01:03:57.720 --> 01:04:01.640]  who knew reeducation when i heard it
[01:04:01.960 --> 01:04:05.720]  who was smart enough to know what i was seeing and said there's a problem i
[01:04:05.720 --> 01:04:08.760]  better do something and then when i began to
[01:04:08.760 --> 01:04:13.000]  stand up and fight and went on access tv 19 years ago and radio 18 years ago or
[01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:18.120]  almost 19 years ago now people smarter than me gave me info
[01:04:18.120 --> 01:04:22.120]  and helped me and they were mainly retired veterans current military
[01:04:22.120 --> 01:04:26.680]  firefighters and police officers and it's funny today
[01:04:26.680 --> 01:04:30.040]  and engineers and people inside the system
[01:04:30.040 --> 01:04:35.320]  and executives and and and patriots and and writers and
[01:04:35.320 --> 01:04:40.040]  and by the time i'd only been on air seven years kurt vonnegut was a listener
[01:04:40.040 --> 01:04:45.080]  and i'm not bragging it's a testament to what you can do standing up
[01:04:45.080 --> 01:04:48.120]  and starting that journey and there are people out there a lot smarter than i
[01:04:48.120 --> 01:04:53.560]  am and i'm here getting the word out to rise up and raise up
[01:04:53.560 --> 01:04:57.160]  and activate other people that are going to bring down the new world order
[01:04:57.160 --> 01:05:00.360]  we're building an army
[01:05:01.080 --> 01:05:05.240]  a chemical spill contaminating the water supply and nine west virginia counties
[01:05:05.240 --> 01:05:08.760]  this year alone over 300 000 people in west virginia had their drinking water
[01:05:08.760 --> 01:05:11.480]  contaminate what are the health effects of having
[01:05:11.480 --> 01:05:15.080]  these drugs in our drinking water it's forced medical treatment without the

[01:08:42.600 --> 01:08:47.800]  for your mind it's not about the tortoise
[01:08:47.800 --> 01:08:51.240]  it's about bankrupting every rancher nationwide
[01:08:51.240 --> 01:08:55.720]  as the federal judge ruled just a few months ago in nevada
[01:08:55.720 --> 01:08:59.800]  judge jones called it a quote criminal conspiracy
[01:08:59.800 --> 01:09:04.200]  to bankrupt ranchers by raising grazing fees
[01:09:04.200 --> 01:09:07.800]  to levels designed to bankrupt them and it turned out that the nature
[01:09:07.800 --> 01:09:11.960]  conservancy seara club and others designed the program
[01:09:11.960 --> 01:09:17.480]  to bankrupt this entire country it's called agenda 21
[01:09:17.480 --> 01:09:20.680]  and coming up at the bottom of the hour i'm going to play unedited the first five
[01:09:20.680 --> 01:09:28.360]  minutes of the msnb msnbc peace where they totally demonize
[01:09:29.240 --> 01:09:33.880]  these people think the chinese are involved in an energy deal
[01:09:33.880 --> 01:09:38.120]  rory say it ain't so these people think there's a thing called zoo 21 they're
[01:09:38.120 --> 01:09:43.960]  crazy just a unesco treating
[01:09:44.120 --> 01:09:50.200]  that bush senior signed on to but the congress didn't ratify
[01:09:50.200 --> 01:09:54.920]  but in a larger issue the reason this story is so important
[01:09:54.920 --> 01:09:58.520]  is they demonize the drudge report
[01:09:59.480 --> 01:10:05.480]  and others and say that we're insurgents and you know what i guess if we have
[01:10:05.480 --> 01:10:07.640]  an occupied government run by the globalist that
[01:10:07.640 --> 01:10:10.920]  plan on looting the nation and making us poor for political control
[01:10:10.920 --> 01:10:15.480]  making us dependent i guess in an occupied america we are insurgents
[01:10:15.480 --> 01:10:22.600]  what's left of america and basic values basic property rights family values
[01:10:22.600 --> 01:10:26.360]  free will free speech values i want to show you some
[01:10:26.360 --> 01:10:29.720]  headlines uh here today of your tv viewer if you're a radio listener i'll
[01:10:29.720 --> 01:10:32.200]  read the headlines on air then i'm going to give the number out and i want to
[01:10:32.200 --> 01:10:35.640]  hear from listeners about what you think about this and the attack on on free
[01:10:35.640 --> 01:10:39.240]  speech in this country the free speech zones the
[01:10:39.240 --> 01:10:43.720]  attack on camera people everywhere about police under orders the
[01:10:43.720 --> 01:10:47.000]  moves to bring an internet taxation sopa sysba
[01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:50.760]  this new secret treaty that got leaked that obama wants to sign with asia
[01:10:50.760 --> 01:10:53.960]  restrict free speech wants to sign it with the chinese government
[01:10:53.960 --> 01:10:58.040]  the chinese government lobbying to have movies not be released that criticize
[01:10:58.040 --> 01:11:03.720]  communism that's in the news all the time from red dawn to x-men
[01:11:03.720 --> 01:11:09.160]  but msnbc says there's no communist chinese influence going on in america
[01:11:09.160 --> 01:11:13.000]  when bill clinton was being exposed for missile secrets on the drudge report
[01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:21.960]  back in 97 i remember nbc news saying is it racist to talk about chinese spies
[01:11:21.960 --> 01:11:26.520]  is it racist to talk about russian spies or israeli spies or
[01:11:26.520 --> 01:11:30.120]  british spies no i think it's about our country being infiltrated by outside
[01:11:30.120 --> 01:11:33.080]  powers that have their interest and we have ours
[01:11:33.080 --> 01:11:38.280]  but see america is globally captured now american elite developed the plan for
[01:11:38.280 --> 01:11:41.560]  planetary world government with the british government and created the
[01:11:41.560 --> 01:11:46.360]  united nations people always say get us out of the un
[01:11:46.360 --> 01:11:50.360]  the robber barons couldn't politically defeat the american people
[01:11:50.360 --> 01:11:54.120]  by 1906 so they went and brought british intelligence over
[01:11:54.120 --> 01:11:58.600]  to set up proud house at the council on fire relations this is all declassified
[01:11:58.600 --> 01:12:01.560]  to use the british empire intelligence model
[01:12:01.560 --> 01:12:05.640]  reestablished here in the u.s to form the new super
[01:12:05.640 --> 01:12:10.520]  uk power structure that doesn't mean england runs it all
[01:12:10.520 --> 01:12:13.960]  now america is the empire and actually treats the british
[01:12:13.960 --> 01:12:17.800]  arrogantly the british people and the people of the uk in general
[01:12:17.800 --> 01:12:21.960]  have paid for the planetary world government
[01:12:25.560 --> 01:12:30.120]  and i'm going to go over this document for folks uh here on air

[01:14:07.080 --> 01:14:10.840]  to the clinton library to get the horde
[01:14:10.840 --> 01:14:19.240]  of his documents that are deposited in the bowels of the infernal facility
[01:14:20.440 --> 01:14:26.600]  and this is only 20 something pages if you don't count the cover sheets
[01:14:26.600 --> 01:14:31.560]  of 300 plus that were allowed to be released
[01:14:31.560 --> 01:14:34.760]  and in the document that i'm showing you
[01:14:34.760 --> 01:14:40.760]  here from the clinton presidential library
[01:14:40.760 --> 01:14:45.160]  it talks about how they've got a deal with the western journalism center
[01:14:45.160 --> 01:14:49.240]  conservative newsletters like ron paul's
[01:14:49.240 --> 01:14:55.160]  the american spectator and the pittsburgh tribune review
[01:14:55.160 --> 01:14:59.560]  now imagine this is the white house then they say stories that first develop
[01:14:59.560 --> 01:15:03.720]  here then percolate into the wall street journal
[01:15:03.720 --> 01:15:07.880]  washington times new york post and then from their percolate
[01:15:07.880 --> 01:15:11.720]  into the controlled total controlled press
[01:15:11.720 --> 01:15:14.760]  and these operations are controlled pretty much now washington times is a
[01:15:14.760 --> 01:15:17.400]  good work so does the wall street journal but not as much new york post
[01:15:17.400 --> 01:15:20.040]  us some good stuff the point is is that you can see the strata
[01:15:20.040 --> 01:15:23.560]  and they talk about how then it flows out of alternative media that was
[01:15:23.560 --> 01:15:28.040]  alternative in its embryonic phase clinton wanted to abort it
[01:15:28.040 --> 01:15:31.880]  with audits and harassment and demonization and then it percolates
[01:15:31.880 --> 01:15:34.920]  into the wall street journal and others and then they say into the
[01:15:34.920 --> 01:15:38.680]  washington post and other publications and then in the
[01:15:38.680 --> 01:15:41.960]  new york times and they go on in here you ought to go
[01:15:41.960 --> 01:15:45.560]  read it for yourself it's up on info wars dot com to actually say
[01:15:45.560 --> 01:15:49.720]  they then can't control all the info and it gives the general public
[01:15:49.720 --> 01:15:54.040]  a voice oh you cannot have any alternative you can't have talk radio
[01:15:54.040 --> 01:15:55.880]  they're trying to bring back in the fairness doctrine
[01:15:55.880 --> 01:15:59.320]  or where my show would be banned they're trying to bring
[01:15:59.320 --> 01:16:02.760]  all of this in fact you're quoting from the document
[01:16:02.760 --> 01:16:07.000]  this is how the stream works firstly well-funded right wing think tanks and
[01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:10.600]  individuals underwrite conservative newsletters that's not true no one is
[01:16:10.600 --> 01:16:14.040]  underwriting us and newspapers such as the western
[01:16:14.040 --> 01:16:17.240]  journalism center no they they funded that with
[01:16:17.240 --> 01:16:20.360]  donations and with people buying the newsletter i happen to know
[01:16:20.360 --> 01:16:23.240]  the american spectator in the pittsburgh tribune review
[01:16:23.240 --> 01:16:27.960]  next the stories are reposted on the internet where they are bounced all
[01:16:27.960 --> 01:16:31.960]  over the world from the internet the stories are
[01:16:31.960 --> 01:16:35.720]  bounced into the mainstream media through one of two ways
[01:16:35.720 --> 01:16:39.240]  one the story will be picked up by the british tabloids
[01:16:39.240 --> 01:16:43.960]  and covered as a major story from which the american
[01:16:43.960 --> 01:16:48.120]  right off the center mainstream media wall street journal
[01:16:48.120 --> 01:16:51.160]  washington times a new york post will then pick up the story
[01:16:51.160 --> 01:16:54.120]  to the story will be bounced directly from the internet
[01:16:54.120 --> 01:16:57.000]  to the right of center mainstream american media
[01:16:57.000 --> 01:17:00.840]  after the mainstream right of center american media covers the story congressional
[01:17:00.840 --> 01:17:03.720]  committees will look into the story oh don't look into cattle gate or the
[01:17:03.720 --> 01:17:07.800]  murders or the missile secrets after congress looks into the story
[01:17:07.800 --> 01:17:12.040]  the story now has the legitimacy to be covered by the remainder
[01:17:12.040 --> 01:17:15.560]  of the american mainstream press as a real story
[01:17:15.560 --> 01:17:19.880]  now let's stop right there what do they say on cnms nbc
[01:17:19.880 --> 01:17:24.200]  oh my gosh alex jones says there's drones alex jones says fast and furious is
[01:17:24.200 --> 01:17:27.080]  staged to get the guns alex jones says there's billions of
[01:17:27.080 --> 01:17:31.080]  bullets none of it's true he's insane but look at this republican congressman
[01:17:31.080 --> 01:17:37.000]  they're having hearings on it meanwhile they bought all the bullets
[01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:40.280]  see how they do that meanwhile they did stage
[01:17:40.280 --> 01:17:46.440]  fast and furious cbs news had to admit because we already broke the information
[01:17:46.520 --> 01:17:50.200]  and again who can really run their blockade every time is drudgereport.com
[01:17:50.200 --> 01:17:54.120]  it's very hard for us but we're still able to do it now break through
[01:17:54.120 --> 01:17:58.040]  directly and really have them freak out
[01:17:58.920 --> 01:18:02.040]  but when it goes on drudge it assuredly breaks out
[01:18:02.040 --> 01:18:08.120]  and that's that's why they're so upset but now more and more there's other
[01:18:08.120 --> 01:18:11.160]  alternative media and people understand the paradigm now and they're
[01:18:11.160 --> 01:18:14.840]  decompartmentalized but when you read these memos it's exactly how the
[01:18:14.840 --> 01:18:19.320]  media is run today it says we've got to call it conspiracy theories
[01:18:19.320 --> 01:18:22.360]  they go on to say anything coming out on the internet
[01:18:22.360 --> 01:18:26.840]  we need to call it conspiracy theories even if it's documented we just call it
[01:18:26.840 --> 01:18:30.200]  a conspiracy theory and say it isn't mainstream
[01:18:30.200 --> 01:18:34.600]  it was the clintons that wrote up the term mainstream media alternative media
[01:18:34.600 --> 01:18:39.480]  and when we adopt the idea that we're the alternative media and they're the
[01:18:39.480 --> 01:18:42.760]  mainstream media no they're the dinosaur decepticon
[01:18:42.760 --> 01:18:47.000]  globalist corporate federal reserve anti-liberty anti-family
[01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:50.440]  the authors of our discontent they're the bad guys i mean look at them the
[01:18:50.440 --> 01:18:54.760]  liars caught lying caught cheating taxpayer funded
[01:18:54.760 --> 01:18:58.120]  bailout funded stimulus money funded and their
[01:18:58.120 --> 01:19:02.680]  ratings are in the toilet now too so you you you are the small media you're the
[01:19:02.680 --> 01:19:08.680]  vestigial media you're the imploded kleptocrat media
[01:19:08.680 --> 01:19:13.560]  and in the memos in the memo they've got emails they've got examples but put
[01:19:13.560 --> 01:19:18.440]  that drudge article back up and i'll cover that
[01:19:18.440 --> 01:19:24.360]  drudge report archives special reports shareware clinton to offer new
[01:19:24.360 --> 01:19:28.520]  missile defense tech to russia china see
[01:19:28.520 --> 01:19:32.200]  that's the type of thing that they're freaking out on the clinton files about
[01:19:32.200 --> 01:19:35.960]  is that clinton would dare give missile secrets to china and see now
[01:19:35.960 --> 01:19:38.760]  we always knew they didn't like drudge breaking that
[01:19:38.760 --> 01:19:42.360]  so now you know we have the documents see
[01:19:42.360 --> 01:19:46.600]  they don't want their treason their sedition their criminality being exposed
[01:19:46.600 --> 01:19:50.760]  and now they want to call us terrorists and they want to use the ndaa on us
[01:19:50.760 --> 01:19:54.120]  and they want to arrest us and they want to say i'm in the boston bombing and
[01:19:54.120 --> 01:19:57.560]  i'm deeply racist because they think their audience is so dumb and they're

[01:25:36.360 --> 01:25:40.920]  bypass i started writing for media bypass in 1996
[01:25:40.920 --> 01:25:44.600]  and it only had a circulation i think of like a hundred thousand
[01:25:44.600 --> 01:25:48.680]  but i wrote articles they contacted me they were looking for fighters
[01:25:48.680 --> 01:25:51.720]  i need to get the head of media bypass on i mean they got audited they got
[01:25:51.720 --> 01:25:55.000]  harassed they got 60 minutes pieces against them
[01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:59.640]  just for putting out stuff that's pretty milk toast today
[01:26:00.360 --> 01:26:03.080]  i remember talking to the head of media bypass i mean these guys are like we
[01:26:03.080 --> 01:26:05.480]  got to defeat them you know they're they're they're
[01:26:05.480 --> 01:26:09.080]  taking people's houses i mean these are like real people folks
[01:26:09.080 --> 01:26:12.920]  and it's got to feel good for all these old guys
[01:26:12.920 --> 01:26:17.240]  uh who were doing this in the 80s back when talk radio was banned
[01:26:17.240 --> 01:26:21.000]  in the so-called free country two of literally expose everything and they
[01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:25.720]  go on to say what are they exposing this is in section seven look at this
[01:26:25.720 --> 01:26:28.920]  the internet influence this is what they want to stop number one watergate
[01:26:28.920 --> 01:26:32.840]  vents foster home page imagine back then there might have been a
[01:26:32.840 --> 01:26:36.920]  dozen websites fighting them and then they influenced people like the young
[01:26:36.920 --> 01:26:41.640]  drudge in 1993 who started his website 94 95
[01:26:41.640 --> 01:26:45.960]  96 first it was email who then became the phenomenon
[01:26:45.960 --> 01:26:49.800]  and then see now we're influencing other people as well and drudge influenced
[01:26:49.800 --> 01:26:52.840]  me i could i mean i would go to a bunch of websites every day
[01:26:52.840 --> 01:26:55.560]  to look for news and stuff to cover on the radio but i would go to drudge
[01:26:55.560 --> 01:26:59.080]  number one and then that inspired me to have a
[01:26:59.080 --> 01:27:02.600]  website where i could post links my site was first like drudge because i wanted
[01:27:02.600 --> 01:27:07.240]  to post links so i could show listeners when i made a claim about a bill
[01:27:07.240 --> 01:27:12.360]  or photos i'd taken back then mainstream media would just lie
[01:27:12.360 --> 01:27:15.560]  they were mainstream media still then and they would just say there is no un
[01:27:15.560 --> 01:27:19.320]  takeover the parks well i would post the executive order
[01:27:19.320 --> 01:27:23.320]  i would go you know post photos and then threaten to arrest me
[01:27:23.320 --> 01:27:27.320]  for asking questions at the grand canyon and then i spend the rest of my time
[01:27:27.320 --> 01:27:30.840]  trying to pay a 20 000 dollar bandwidth bill because you know a half
[01:27:30.840 --> 01:27:38.120]  million people would visit my website in a month to look at those photos
[01:27:38.120 --> 01:27:40.920]  i mean i got into this when there was hardly anybody doing it that's why i
[01:27:40.920 --> 01:27:44.920]  went through so much hell the harassment the cars following me the
[01:27:44.920 --> 01:27:48.040]  audits guys beat me up in parking lots uh
[01:27:48.040 --> 01:27:51.640]  i mean back in the day folks back in like 1996
[01:27:51.640 --> 01:27:56.440]  i was kind of second wave there was first wave second wave i would say drudge
[01:27:56.440 --> 01:28:00.200]  was the end of the first wave i was the beginning of the second wave
[01:28:00.200 --> 01:28:03.720]  we're now into fourth wave there's been third wave
[01:28:03.720 --> 01:28:08.040]  by the mid 2000s that now we're going to fourth wave fifth wave starting to start
[01:28:08.040 --> 01:28:12.520]  and fifth wave is so big the enemy is just absolutely crapping their pants
[01:28:12.520 --> 01:28:14.920]  right now
[01:28:18.600 --> 01:28:22.440]  what are you gonna dispatch uh mercenaries to beat everybody up in the
[01:28:22.440 --> 01:28:26.360]  parking lot or threaten their families there's too many of us now
[01:28:26.360 --> 01:28:30.680]  you can't blow stuff up and blame us because you know our people are everywhere
[01:28:30.680 --> 01:28:34.440]  our people are everywhere and they're symbiotic they're independent
[01:28:34.440 --> 01:28:37.880]  they're not directed by a central system you can't track them and they don't
[01:28:37.880 --> 01:28:41.560]  care if you track them they're willing to lock and load
[01:28:41.560 --> 01:28:45.480]  and walk with their guns down at your guns pointed at them saying go ahead to
[01:28:45.480 --> 01:28:48.360]  shoot us and that courage freaks you out because
[01:28:48.360 --> 01:28:51.240]  other people see that courage and if you would have killed them it had been
[01:28:51.240 --> 01:28:56.920]  alamo part two it had been lexington part two right there
[01:28:56.920 --> 01:29:00.600]  and believe me i didn't even want that to happen i want to fix this peacefully
[01:29:00.600 --> 01:29:05.640]  but if you want a war to start if you chicken net pieces a traitorous crap
[01:29:05.640 --> 01:29:10.440]  at the white house and all of you think you had a problem with a few websites

[01:29:20.120 --> 01:29:23.080]  you're gonna legitimize us you're gonna lionize us
[01:29:23.080 --> 01:29:27.480]  you're gonna give us martyrdom and again i'm not looking for that
[01:29:27.480 --> 01:29:30.600]  i don't think i get 40 virgins or whatever it is
[01:29:30.600 --> 01:29:34.280]  what i get is a free future for my family and your family and what i get
[01:29:34.280 --> 01:29:37.720]  is not letting bug-eyed chicken-necked cowardly

[01:34:20.120 --> 01:34:24.040]  we now have the white house memos joseph eras on the show friday to talk about
[01:34:24.040 --> 01:34:27.320]  this where what was clinton worried about
[01:34:27.320 --> 01:34:31.800]  in 1993 94 whitewater vince foster home page
[01:34:31.800 --> 01:34:35.320]  i remember that site listing all the deaths people with their arms and legs
[01:34:35.320 --> 01:34:37.560]  chopped off shot nine times in the head
[01:34:37.560 --> 01:34:41.640]  fami malek would rule it a suicide clinton's medical examiner
[01:34:41.640 --> 01:34:45.240]  remember all that the clinton chronicles all of it
[01:34:45.240 --> 01:34:49.480]  oh how to shut down communications on the net between congressional republicans
[01:34:49.480 --> 01:34:53.240]  and right-wing conspiracy theory proponents
[01:34:53.240 --> 01:34:57.640]  and again they talk about defining any criticism of any claims of corruption
[01:34:57.640 --> 01:35:00.520]  that doesn't exist even though it all came out
[01:35:00.520 --> 01:35:05.000]  new york times article washington post article sandiego union tribune article
[01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:10.680]  washington post article this was them freaking out over just a few articles
[01:35:10.680 --> 01:35:15.160]  can you imagine now how they feel knowing that the average msnbc show has
[01:35:15.160 --> 01:35:20.360]  about a hundred thousand viewers their top shows half a mill
[01:35:20.360 --> 01:35:23.640]  can you imagine now now what's going to happen here though is is that they do
[01:35:23.640 --> 01:35:26.600]  have the stage terror card and they will probably play it it's all
[01:35:26.600 --> 01:35:29.960]  they've got even though we're gonna expose them on that front
[01:35:29.960 --> 01:35:34.840]  and i think because they are so exposed it'll be incredibly heinous
[01:35:34.840 --> 01:35:39.000]  i think i think obama's thinking about nuke in new york city i really do
[01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:41.800]  and i've been telling you that for a long time and now you said his number
[01:35:41.800 --> 01:35:47.640]  one fear is a nuke he doesn't say who blowing up manhattan
[01:35:47.640 --> 01:35:52.280]  and i think what the bundy ranch message sends them is this
[01:35:52.280 --> 01:35:55.720]  the words gone out that criminal elements hijacked the country interstaging
[01:35:55.720 --> 01:35:59.160]  terror attacks and so even if you try to nuke new york to
[01:35:59.160 --> 01:36:02.440]  bring in total martial law even if you unplug the internet and
[01:36:02.440 --> 01:36:06.920]  everything it's not going to work and i know you have a total blood lust to go
[01:36:06.920 --> 01:36:11.160]  after bitter clingers and socialist and communist are the foot soldiers of the
[01:36:11.160 --> 01:36:14.520]  foreign banks the fascist but they use socialist
[01:36:14.520 --> 01:36:19.080]  and communist as their foot soldiers and they so hate freedom
[01:36:19.080 --> 01:36:23.080]  and so want to put us in those weatherman camps
[01:36:23.080 --> 01:36:26.760]  and so want to be able to just say your kids belong to us and
[01:36:26.760 --> 01:36:32.040]  totally take over once and for all that they may do anything that's why it's
[01:36:32.040 --> 01:36:35.480]  important to really dominate them up front
[01:36:35.480 --> 01:36:39.240]  because if you let one tyrant stand up they might all stand up
[01:36:39.240 --> 01:36:42.680]  and stage a terror attack and then there goes america and then we'll have nuclear
[01:36:42.680 --> 01:36:46.040]  war and there goes the planet to turn a bug's life on its head
[01:36:46.040 --> 01:36:49.240]  you let one aunt stand up they might all stand up
[01:36:49.240 --> 01:36:52.440]  and then there goes our way of life well what about we keep letting the tyrants
[01:36:52.440 --> 01:36:55.640]  run all over us they're going to get so megalomaniacal
[01:36:55.640 --> 01:36:59.000]  they're going to jump the shark and bite off more than they can chew
[01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:02.360]  it's not just with us they're starting wars with russia china's starting wars
[01:37:02.360 --> 01:37:06.600]  with japan season the ships for ships japan took in the 1930s
[01:37:06.600 --> 01:37:10.520]  war is brewing because there's a global financial meltdown happening because
[01:37:10.520 --> 01:37:13.560]  of the derivatives and attacks on productivity
[01:37:13.560 --> 01:37:17.320]  and overpopulation in some areas i don't believe in the general theories of
[01:37:17.320 --> 01:37:21.400]  overpopulation the way they're deployed there is overpopulation in many areas
[01:37:21.400 --> 01:37:24.600]  and there's cultures that don't have missions
[01:37:24.600 --> 01:37:28.200]  and are just living in absolute squalor in hell
[01:37:28.200 --> 01:37:31.640]  and the globalists are usually aiding and abetting that as the british
[01:37:31.640 --> 01:37:35.000]  commission on human on population stated in 49
[01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:39.160]  i mean they admitted that because they don't want to get from easy and fire to
[01:37:39.160 --> 01:37:43.240]  the third world and build them up you industrialize you quit having
[01:37:43.240 --> 01:37:48.040]  even enough kids to replace yourself you get a 1.2 1.3 1.4
[01:37:48.040 --> 01:37:50.600]  replacement rate you need 2.1 as everybody knows
[01:37:50.600 --> 01:37:55.480]  to even hold the society up so they've figured out a collapse algorithm
[01:37:55.480 --> 01:37:59.560]  where they see the collapse before it happens and they orchestrate it
[01:37:59.560 --> 01:38:04.440]  before the flash points come that cause a collapse that they're not steering
[01:38:04.440 --> 01:38:08.280]  you see what i'm saying and then in that collapse
[01:38:08.280 --> 01:38:12.520]  they plan to target the best members of the human civilization
[01:38:12.520 --> 01:38:16.760]  because we're seen as alpha leaders who challenge them
[01:38:16.760 --> 01:38:19.960]  in their override of humanity and that's again their ultimate sin
[01:38:19.960 --> 01:38:24.440]  i keep restating that is a sin against humanity even if you believe in god
[01:38:24.440 --> 01:38:29.400]  that is a sin against the species it is eugenics
[01:38:29.400 --> 01:38:33.240]  inverted not even targeting of the weak
[01:38:33.240 --> 01:38:37.320]  is the targeting of the strong but eugenics was always about that
[01:38:37.320 --> 01:38:40.280]  that's outer eugenics is the targeting of the weak and the
[01:38:40.280 --> 01:38:45.800]  and the and the mentally ill but it's it's authored by
[01:38:45.800 --> 01:38:49.160]  inbred globalists who were obsessed with genes
[01:38:49.160 --> 01:38:53.880]  because they were so inbred most their children were absolute nightmares or
[01:38:53.880 --> 01:38:57.480]  or were born dead so the elite put all their money into finding
[01:38:57.480 --> 01:39:01.000]  what made humans operate
[01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:05.480]  it's incredible i mean they are master builders
[01:39:05.480 --> 01:39:09.160]  they are incredible engineers they are smart i mean i'll give it to them
[01:39:09.160 --> 01:39:11.800]  but the thing is they've got this twist of cane in them
[01:39:11.800 --> 01:39:16.280]  that makes them so wicked that anything they build ends up
[01:39:16.280 --> 01:39:20.840]  being predatory and just destroying everything in its path
[01:39:20.840 --> 01:39:25.720]  collectively the the globalists are an artificial intelligence already and
[01:39:25.720 --> 01:39:29.640]  let me announce to you here now unequivocally
[01:39:29.640 --> 01:39:33.880]  that artificial intelligence has existed for at least 10 years
[01:39:33.880 --> 01:39:39.800]  and it is called the internet the internet is a upload of an already
[01:39:39.800 --> 01:39:46.680]  existing sentient system but on a mass scale it is the collective
[01:39:46.680 --> 01:39:54.040]  minnesota multi phasic system squared to infinity algorithmed and sent
[01:39:54.040 --> 01:39:59.240]  into the giant mainframe grids to predict the future and then be able
[01:39:59.240 --> 01:40:03.080]  to steer the future with artificial stimuli
[01:40:03.080 --> 01:40:06.440]  brought in from the outside and i've told you this for 10 years
[01:40:06.440 --> 01:40:09.720]  now it's mainstream news
[01:40:10.040 --> 01:40:16.600]  and this artificial intelligence is piloted you can say is it conscious
[01:40:16.600 --> 01:40:20.680]  is it sentient i would say it is because it's animated by the ghost of the
[01:40:20.680 --> 01:40:25.240]  machine that is human will and intellect and choices and desires
[01:40:25.240 --> 01:40:30.280]  flowing through it okay
[01:40:30.280 --> 01:40:34.280]  but then you've got almost possession of the artificial system
[01:40:34.280 --> 01:40:38.120]  by the technocrats at the top those that control the keys
[01:40:38.120 --> 01:40:42.520]  to the nsa and the microsoft and google grids
[01:40:42.520 --> 01:40:46.520]  and what the elite did was decide to carve it up so that one person didn't
[01:40:46.520 --> 01:40:50.520]  have all the rings of mordor and so keys or rings
[01:40:50.520 --> 01:40:56.120]  were given to microsoft given to apple given to google given to the nsa the
[01:40:56.120 --> 01:40:59.480]  pentagon wants keys that's what cyber security is
[01:40:59.480 --> 01:41:02.520]  they're all battling the chinese were given keys
[01:41:02.520 --> 01:41:06.040]  the brits were given keys nato was given keys
[01:41:06.040 --> 01:41:09.320]  inner pole to a certain extent was given keys or rings
[01:41:09.320 --> 01:41:12.600]  they were given rings of power to use that analogy that's actually how the
[01:41:12.600 --> 01:41:15.240]  globalist uh describe it i said it's like a
[01:41:15.240 --> 01:41:18.680]  palantir or a ring and now we get the secret nsa documents that's what they
[01:41:18.680 --> 01:41:21.720]  call them rings and palantirs i mean i just know their mind
[01:41:21.720 --> 01:41:25.720]  because i have an organic system as well that's able to gather the data
[01:41:25.720 --> 01:41:29.640]  and understand how humans operate so i know how humans are manifesting
[01:41:29.640 --> 01:41:33.400]  because i know man i know how they're manifesting in the artificial
[01:41:33.400 --> 01:41:38.040]  intelligence do you understand that the artificial
[01:41:38.040 --> 01:41:41.400]  intelligence there it is seven people who've been entrusted with the keys of
[01:41:41.400 --> 01:41:43.480]  the internet i didn't even know that was in the news
[01:41:43.480 --> 01:41:47.560]  i already know most of the time what's in the news before it's in the news
[01:41:47.560 --> 01:41:54.360]  because i know the mind of this system because i live it and i study it
[01:41:54.360 --> 01:41:59.240]  and you can see it all being built around you so remember from the beginning
[01:41:59.240 --> 01:42:01.880]  they wanted to keep libertarian or traditionalist
[01:42:01.880 --> 01:42:05.480]  or conservative ideas out or anyone just exposing man a lot of people are getting
[01:42:05.480 --> 01:42:09.240]  murdered a lot of people are dying vince foster
[01:42:09.240 --> 01:42:15.000]  this shows these are just people we're facing and they'll always be people
[01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:18.600]  they claim they're going to dial into the internet they claim they're going to be
[01:42:18.600 --> 01:42:21.560]  sentient and tied into everything and then they openly say in all their
[01:42:21.560 --> 01:42:25.000]  writings that that those of us that don't join the collective will be
[01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:29.400]  eliminated that's a 1970s pentagon document that
[01:42:29.400 --> 01:42:34.040]  was reclassified it was declassified in 2001 reclassified
[01:42:34.040 --> 01:42:37.480]  the federation of american scientists released it
[01:42:37.480 --> 01:42:42.280]  and then it was reclassified but the pentagon said full spectrum dominance
[01:42:42.280 --> 01:42:46.920]  is the evolution of television smart computers
[01:42:46.920 --> 01:42:51.400]  smart glasses smart contacts the first ports it'll be status symbols
[01:42:51.400 --> 01:42:55.960]  brain implants and then moving completely into humans that will live a
[01:42:55.960 --> 01:43:00.920]  time in tanks for their safety in an embryonic
[01:43:00.920 --> 01:43:05.000]  dream state basically into the neural hive they call it a hive
[01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:10.200]  and then finally you will transcend your body and the biological side of you will
[01:43:10.200 --> 01:43:14.760]  be removed and if you don't accept that you will be just stepped on like a bug
[01:43:14.760 --> 01:43:18.760]  to quote rake hers well you're going alex i've heard of this before
[01:43:18.760 --> 01:43:23.160]  it's called the matrix yes the wachowski brothers got what they put in that movie
[01:43:23.160 --> 01:43:27.640]  from a lot of sources but it came ladies and gentlemen
[01:43:27.640 --> 01:43:34.280]  from the pentagon and darpa the internet came from DARPA and the pentagon
[01:43:34.280 --> 01:43:38.120]  this is a master decision that has been made
[01:43:38.120 --> 01:43:42.040]  to end you and your family as you know it the mega churches have all brought the
[01:43:42.040 --> 01:43:44.120]  xboxes and smartphones in for the kids
[01:43:44.120 --> 01:43:46.760]  they're telling the women divorce their husbands
[01:43:46.760 --> 01:43:50.680]  i mean you are just going to see the total manifestation of evil ladies and
[01:43:50.680 --> 01:43:52.920]  gentlemen
[01:43:52.920 --> 01:43:57.080]  you're going to see the will of the horrible people
[01:43:57.080 --> 01:44:00.680]  like a zealomanual and bill gates and bill clinton
[01:44:00.680 --> 01:44:04.600]  and george soros and the queen of england you're going to see these people
[01:44:04.600 --> 01:44:09.880]  given this incredible power i'm here to tell you the singularity
[01:44:09.880 --> 01:44:14.040]  is going to happen in stages but the singularity
[01:44:14.040 --> 01:44:17.560]  for humans dialing in for the elite to be able to predict
[01:44:17.560 --> 01:44:22.440]  general future trends to what with 100 algorithm
[01:44:22.440 --> 01:44:25.960]  is now happening the problem in the algorithm
[01:44:25.960 --> 01:44:31.240]  is alternative independent media exposing criminal operations
[01:44:31.240 --> 01:44:37.640]  because if you revert to your original human programming against corruption
[01:44:37.640 --> 01:44:42.280]  and if you click back into that mode and not their new programming they can't
[01:44:42.280 --> 01:44:44.680]  predict the future they can only predict the future
[01:44:44.680 --> 01:44:49.720]  because they're feeding you the stimuli to be able to predict the future
[01:44:49.720 --> 01:44:53.480]  that's how amazon can begin to ship your package before you go to the website
[01:44:53.480 --> 01:44:56.120]  and order it they know what you're going to order with their algorithms
[01:44:56.120 --> 01:45:00.120]  but that's only because they've been tracking you for 10 years
[01:45:00.120 --> 01:45:05.480]  when you break with them now you are reborn and this is not even religious
[01:45:05.480 --> 01:45:11.560]  this is a program level algorithm you have an ancient algorithm unknown
[01:45:11.560 --> 01:45:15.000]  in its true providence the eye has not seen here has not heard
[01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:18.440]  god's real operation they put out fake men
[01:45:18.440 --> 01:45:22.040]  to stunt and descience the ancient teachings
[01:45:22.040 --> 01:45:25.640]  so that you will not go back to the basic common sense
[01:45:25.640 --> 01:45:30.680]  of what the earth really is so you will accept these new demigods
[01:45:30.680 --> 01:45:35.000]  as your gods what type of god says we're crap
[01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:38.200]  when we were able to build this and plans to kill us
[01:45:38.200 --> 01:45:44.360]  when we manifest it as a god ray Kurzweil said i don't believe in god yet
[01:45:44.360 --> 01:45:48.680]  i went and saw transcendence last night an incredibly wicked movie
[01:45:48.680 --> 01:45:53.000]  where the where he is johnny depth the scientist the computer is
[01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:59.160]  god manifest and it it it brings the general public
[01:45:59.160 --> 01:46:04.360]  back to the stone age the singularity destroys technology except for
[01:46:04.360 --> 01:46:10.280]  itself and now it is a biotech in the earth's
[01:46:10.280 --> 01:46:14.280]  genetic code to save it well let me tell you
[01:46:14.280 --> 01:46:18.120]  everything that the system's bringing out rewrites the genetic code
[01:46:18.120 --> 01:46:21.800]  and ends the planet as we know it
[01:46:21.800 --> 01:46:27.320]  so this is what they're doing and their religion is in your face that they're
[01:46:27.320 --> 01:46:33.640]  god folks do you think rachel madow or janet rino is your god
[01:46:36.280 --> 01:46:40.200]  the creator made us and we were able to create this
[01:46:40.200 --> 01:46:44.520]  these people have hijacked the promethean fire that god gave us
[01:46:44.520 --> 01:46:49.480]  and then they tell us their god when the spark of god
[01:46:49.480 --> 01:46:54.440]  little g was given to us in the image
[01:46:54.440 --> 01:46:58.120]  and then everything they do is to attack the image
[01:46:58.120 --> 01:47:01.400]  and to attack the creation because it looks
[01:47:01.400 --> 01:47:05.640]  like and acts like and has the stamp and the smaller algorithm
[01:47:05.640 --> 01:47:09.880]  of the greater creator the truth is we are the nano tech
[01:47:09.880 --> 01:47:16.680]  of god we the life on this planet are the finger of god and the enemy has
[01:47:16.680 --> 01:47:23.320]  hacked us and is using our power to create to then create
[01:47:23.320 --> 01:47:28.120]  abominations on the face of the earth
[01:47:30.760 --> 01:47:34.520]  i mean are you going to be ruled by that narcissistic stunted small
[01:47:34.520 --> 01:47:37.480]  technician of evil
[01:47:38.520 --> 01:47:43.640]  rachel madow the people on msnbc saying quote i'm a terrorist connected to the
[01:47:43.640 --> 01:47:46.680]  boston bombing who's deeply racist my lawyer said oh you'll
[01:47:46.680 --> 01:47:49.400]  definitely want to lawsuit against them it'll take two years
[01:47:49.400 --> 01:47:53.240]  you want to do that no everyone knows they're discredited
[01:47:53.240 --> 01:47:57.400]  everyone has voted organically that they don't want to watch them
[01:47:57.400 --> 01:48:02.440]  we don't want your godhead we don't want your manifestation
[01:48:02.440 --> 01:48:06.280]  we don't think you're god we don't want to follow you
[01:48:06.280 --> 01:48:10.440]  we don't want to worship you we are fulfilled we are
[01:48:10.440 --> 01:48:15.640]  our destiny is there for us you are not our destiny
[01:48:15.640 --> 01:48:19.560]  you are an abomination you are death you stink
[01:48:19.560 --> 01:48:26.600]  you're ugly you smell literally you understand that you are a failure
[01:48:26.600 --> 01:48:32.520]  it's why you want to butcher us it's why you hate us
[01:48:32.520 --> 01:48:36.840]  do you understand that scum stand down get behind us
[01:48:36.840 --> 01:48:43.000]  msnbc white house get behind me satan get behind me i do not want to be part
[01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:45.960]  of your works i am a free sentient being in the
[01:48:45.960 --> 01:48:50.360]  universe and under universal law i declare my freedom
[01:48:50.360 --> 01:48:54.680]  i declare that i will have justice and i declare i am not your slave
[01:48:54.680 --> 01:49:00.520]  you got that you understand that i think you do you don't like that do you
[01:49:00.520 --> 01:49:04.680]  now get out of humanities way if you guys think you can get your own resources
[01:49:04.680 --> 01:49:07.480]  that weren't stolen and go off to some asteroid
[01:49:07.480 --> 01:49:11.080]  and build the hellish world you want to build you go there and feed off each
[01:49:11.080 --> 01:49:14.760]  other and be greedy and hateful and scum and pose that you're the good guys
[01:49:14.760 --> 01:49:19.000]  all day we don't want to be around you
[01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:23.080]  our children are ours and they belong to the thousand generations before us
[01:49:23.080 --> 01:49:27.560]  they do not belong to you you belong to your generations
[01:49:27.560 --> 01:49:32.440]  of evil failed scum guaranteed
[01:49:32.440 --> 01:49:36.200]  you go be with your people will be with ours how's that sound
[01:49:36.200 --> 01:49:40.440]  and people whose genetics resonate with us
[01:49:40.440 --> 01:49:43.960]  old young black white north south east west
[01:49:43.960 --> 01:49:50.920]  they will be called to the true light you will be called to your inferno
[01:49:50.920 --> 01:49:59.800]  that you flap around like blind moths so you've got your god we've got our god
[01:49:59.800 --> 01:50:03.880]  our god is the god that has justice and that has
[01:50:03.880 --> 01:50:08.920]  families and that has honor and truth and we can see the fruits of your god
[01:50:08.920 --> 01:50:13.800]  your god creates world war three your god creates al-qaeda
[01:50:13.800 --> 01:50:17.560]  your god creates death and destruction and abortion and fraud
[01:50:17.560 --> 01:50:20.360]  your god creates giant ghettos of dependent
[01:50:20.360 --> 01:50:24.120]  soulless people grown up in front of television their whole lives
[01:50:24.120 --> 01:50:28.840]  acting like thugs with giant prisons and record cancer rates
[01:50:28.840 --> 01:50:32.920]  we don't like where you take us we don't like the way you taste
[01:50:32.920 --> 01:50:36.840]  and you force fetus a lot of your evil we're now going to stick our fingers
[01:50:36.840 --> 01:50:41.560]  down our throats and vomit you out of us we're now going to exercise you
[01:50:41.560 --> 01:50:45.320]  we're now going to perform a global exorcism and kick your asses off the

[01:54:36.840 --> 01:54:42.120]  the documents the ones they released they were dacted over 90%
[01:54:42.120 --> 01:54:46.440]  saying we want to shut down new media we don't want the public you can go read
[01:54:46.440 --> 01:54:51.400]  the 30 pages or some where they say we don't want the public having access
[01:54:51.400 --> 01:54:55.080]  we only want controlled media this could really you know cause
[01:54:55.080 --> 01:54:58.760]  this big problems that's who these people are anytime the
[01:54:58.760 --> 01:55:02.120]  globalists get control of a country they put a dictatorship in if they can
[01:55:02.120 --> 01:55:05.400]  and that's what homeland security is is the incremental dictatorship the
[01:55:05.400 --> 01:55:09.000]  politically correct dictatorship over america and everyone's starting to see
[01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:11.560]  that and this could really boomerang on the
[01:55:11.560 --> 01:55:14.840]  establishment and we could have a renaissance a restoration in this
[01:55:14.840 --> 01:55:18.600]  country and then worldwide you notice the us doesn't even
[01:55:18.600 --> 01:55:22.120]  criticize chinese abuses anymore of their political class
[01:55:22.120 --> 01:55:27.400]  and their general public because they support it
[01:55:27.400 --> 01:55:30.840]  we have become the bad guys we have bad people running things
[01:55:30.840 --> 01:55:36.360]  we have to say no and now there's so many other media outlets in the world
[01:55:36.360 --> 01:55:40.840]  english is the world language they talk about this in the document as well
[01:55:40.840 --> 01:55:44.520]  and so if our stuff doesn't get published here or doesn't get picked up here it
[01:55:44.520 --> 01:55:48.280]  gets picked up around the world and see most media only cares about their
[01:55:48.280 --> 01:55:53.720]  market who they target i get asked all the time by consultants and people
[01:55:53.720 --> 01:55:56.440]  you know well how do you target your demographic
[01:55:56.440 --> 01:56:00.440]  i don't target anything i tell you what i think what i've researched
[01:56:00.440 --> 01:56:03.720]  and i want to reach russians and chinese and africans
[01:56:03.720 --> 01:56:07.720]  and brazilians and and mexicans and south islanders
[01:56:07.720 --> 01:56:12.120]  and germans and israelis and syrians i want to reach
[01:56:12.120 --> 01:56:16.280]  all of them i get a thrill when i get a call from syria
[01:56:16.280 --> 01:56:20.440]  or a call from israel i get a thrill when i get a call from germany or
[01:56:20.440 --> 01:56:24.600]  australia i want to reach people i want to empower
[01:56:24.600 --> 01:56:28.120]  people i want to stop the thugs and the bullies and the cartels
[01:56:28.120 --> 01:56:31.960]  their tax exempt while raising taxes so high it's making it hard to live
[01:56:31.960 --> 01:56:37.640]  worldwide i take it personal
[01:56:39.160 --> 01:56:43.320]  and we need to start taking it personal but it shows how scared they are a
[01:56:43.320 --> 01:56:46.680]  and and be what authoritarians they are and then you understand when you watch
[01:56:46.680 --> 01:56:50.600]  msnbc now when they're up there saying that drudge
[01:56:50.600 --> 01:56:53.240]  report picks up info wars and it's terrible and
[01:56:53.240 --> 01:56:56.600]  and it's connected to violence and terrorism and these people are radicals
[01:56:56.600 --> 01:57:00.040]  and what are we going to do that's a dying operation
[01:57:00.040 --> 01:57:04.520]  literally that just keeps the lights on as a propaganda operation losing money
[01:57:04.520 --> 01:57:07.240]  to make it look like they still have moral authority
[01:57:07.240 --> 01:57:11.080]  trying to boss everyone around but as soon as the libertarians figure out
[01:57:11.080 --> 01:57:13.800]  and the constitutionalist that they've got the power
[01:57:13.800 --> 01:57:16.600]  it's game over

[02:02:55.480 --> 02:03:00.440]  yes i would like to tell you about a bill that was defeated by two votes
[02:03:00.440 --> 02:03:07.960]  it's uh it's house bill uh 2700 as federal acquisition state lands monitoring
[02:03:07.960 --> 02:03:14.360]  and then this bill it would have uh it would have said monitor federal
[02:03:14.360 --> 02:03:18.360]  activity for proposals to sell a transfer federal land to
[02:03:18.360 --> 02:03:22.760]  private group or individual or to designate national monuments in the
[02:03:22.760 --> 02:03:27.080]  state notify the attorney general when state lands or
[02:03:27.080 --> 02:03:30.680]  private lands are acquired by the federal government
[02:03:30.680 --> 02:03:34.280]  also inform the governor the president of the senate
[02:03:34.280 --> 02:03:38.360]  uh the speaker of the house representative chair persons of the
[02:03:38.360 --> 02:03:41.880]  senate natural resources ruler fair committee house
[02:03:41.880 --> 02:03:47.560]  representatives energy etc and this was defeated by two votes
[02:03:47.560 --> 02:03:52.120]  and three of our rhino republicans voted against this bill
[02:03:52.120 --> 02:03:55.240]  yes because they all want to get a piece of it again
[02:03:55.240 --> 02:03:58.760]  more than half the west is a quote controlled by the feds
[02:03:58.760 --> 02:04:01.560]  and now they're trying to grab land in texas as well
[02:04:01.560 --> 02:04:05.480]  in other areas they're claiming all the waterway areas are going to quote be
[02:04:05.480 --> 02:04:08.440]  historic now or strategic and they're going to grab those
[02:04:08.440 --> 02:04:11.080]  that's why they're deploying homeland security gunboats all over rivers
[02:04:11.080 --> 02:04:15.880]  everywhere to menace the public so the storm troopers are everywhere
[02:04:15.880 --> 02:04:19.560]  and it is a resource power grab taxation power grab
[02:04:19.560 --> 02:04:23.480]  there's a lot of state moves to try to go after federal land
[02:04:23.480 --> 02:04:28.520]  and it's an idea whose time has come and it's the american system
[02:04:28.520 --> 02:04:31.320]  that's why you've got about five to ten percent of the land being federal in
[02:04:31.320 --> 02:04:35.800]  most eastern states and in the midwest and you go out to
[02:04:35.800 --> 02:04:39.960]  the west it's over half federal with right at 90 percent now
[02:04:39.960 --> 02:04:43.640]  in uh nevada and you're absolutely right
[02:04:43.640 --> 02:04:47.320]  we should get that bill passed and look at the rhinos that shot it down
[02:04:47.320 --> 02:04:51.080]  you want to get america moving again
[02:04:51.080 --> 02:04:54.840]  turn over to the state large portions of the west
[02:04:54.840 --> 02:04:58.680]  and uh divvy it up they're already mining on it it's just globalists the only
[02:04:58.680 --> 02:05:01.240]  ones get to come do it
[02:05:01.240 --> 02:05:05.000]  from the water table to our soils to the atmosphere itself
[02:05:05.000 --> 02:05:08.520]  our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day
[02:05:08.520 --> 02:05:12.520]  but it's not just the air outside that's toxic indoor air has been shown to have
[02:05:12.520 --> 02:05:16.200]  two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air
[02:05:16.200 --> 02:05:20.600]  and most americans spend 90 percent of their time inside using toxic chemicals
[02:05:20.600 --> 02:05:23.160]  within their homes there are more than 42 million
[02:05:23.160 --> 02:05:27.480]  smokers in the united states well over a thousand types of mold in mildew
[02:05:27.480 --> 02:05:30.920]  linked to numerous conditions and don't forget the fact that six million
[02:05:30.920 --> 02:05:34.120]  americans live with pets they're allergic to as well when i began to
[02:05:34.120 --> 02:05:38.360]  research these statistics it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my

[02:08:17.560 --> 02:08:30.680]  it's alex jones
[02:08:30.680 --> 02:08:35.640]  i warned of this in my first documentary film that came out in 1997
[02:08:35.640 --> 02:08:38.200]  because people wouldn't believe me that the un was taking over
[02:08:38.200 --> 02:08:40.920]  about half the land in the country all the public land
[02:08:40.920 --> 02:08:44.920]  under treating i showed the executive order i had members of congress on
[02:08:44.920 --> 02:08:48.360]  uh documenting that indeed it did do that
[02:08:48.360 --> 02:08:51.560]  but they really warned about the waterways movements
[02:08:51.560 --> 02:08:55.400]  they're being pushed by clinton at the time that were later brought in
[02:08:55.400 --> 02:08:59.160]  under executive order under bush and uh obama
[02:08:59.160 --> 02:09:03.080]  to say that any waterway including a pond in your backyard
[02:09:03.080 --> 02:09:06.360]  is arrestable offense if you build anything on it or
[02:09:06.360 --> 02:09:10.120]  have crops on it and you know the cases they're all over the news
[02:09:10.120 --> 02:09:14.840]  uh where somebody has one inch of water in their backyard or
[02:09:14.840 --> 02:09:17.800]  on their farm and they build something and they get arrested
[02:09:17.800 --> 02:09:21.080]  and the news goes that's good we need to arrest everyone
[02:09:21.080 --> 02:09:27.000]  i mean this is the new green police idea but the rivers themselves
[02:09:27.000 --> 02:09:30.680]  are under these different waterway acts being grabbed up and and and the blm
[02:09:30.680 --> 02:09:33.960]  is just coming in and saying this was state right away but
[02:09:33.960 --> 02:09:37.480]  in an executive order this has been designated as federal
[02:09:37.480 --> 02:09:41.080]  and don't even come into local sheriffs and people and say we'll give you
[02:09:41.080 --> 02:09:44.440]  federal grants if you petition the state to ask for this so they'll
[02:09:44.440 --> 02:09:48.440]  act like everyone wants it and then pretty soon you get to have federal
[02:09:48.440 --> 02:09:54.200]  goons at the boat ramp in Tennessee or in Texas
[02:09:54.200 --> 02:09:57.400]  and i've been running into them folks because i hunt and fish and it is not
[02:09:57.400 --> 02:10:01.400]  fun i mean they walk over hand on gun and just stare at you
[02:10:01.400 --> 02:10:04.920]  you're just like are you mentally ill i mean
[02:10:04.920 --> 02:10:09.480]  seriously but they want you to know you're not supposed to be here
[02:10:09.480 --> 02:10:15.000]  scum i told the story back in the i'm gonna go to
[02:10:15.000 --> 02:10:18.920]  your phone calls back in the fall i guess it was forgot to cold i took my
[02:10:18.920 --> 02:10:21.880]  children out my buddy Shane stoner on his boat on lake
[02:10:21.880 --> 02:10:25.880]  austin and they were wakeboarding his uh
[02:10:25.880 --> 02:10:30.520]  nephews the uh national champion for 11 year olds and wakeboarding
[02:10:30.520 --> 02:10:33.640]  or is it ten rocker stoner the point is for all out there having
[02:10:33.640 --> 02:10:38.520]  an absolutely great time and there's only about 10 boats out there and i
[02:10:38.520 --> 02:10:43.000]  watch the the lake police that i guess are with lcra
[02:10:43.000 --> 02:10:46.440]  driving around bugging their eyes out at people's boats with them pulled over
[02:10:46.440 --> 02:10:50.120]  or kayaks so they pull up behind us and are sitting there bugging their eyes
[02:10:50.120 --> 02:10:54.040]  out with their chest out literally like a cartoon character so i did it and
[02:10:54.040 --> 02:10:57.480]  Shane starts laughing and got his iphone ready and i stood there sticking my
[02:10:57.480 --> 02:11:02.120]  chest out and then they started laughing and drove past me
[02:11:02.120 --> 02:11:07.800]  i mean i can't imagine as a man with guns driving up
[02:11:07.800 --> 02:11:11.240]  but it's like that cop in georgetown at north of austin
[02:11:11.240 --> 02:11:15.480]  just tripping kids for no reason and shoving girls down just for fun
[02:11:15.480 --> 02:11:20.120]  in front of people hell let him pull a sword out just kill a few because he's
[02:11:20.120 --> 02:11:24.200]  god the samurai who everybody lionizes would sometimes test a new
[02:11:24.200 --> 02:11:27.000]  blade out on a villager that didn't bow far enough
[02:11:27.000 --> 02:11:29.960]  and i think that georgetown cop should have probably just pulled a samurai
[02:11:29.960 --> 02:11:34.680]  sword out and killed a half dozen kids huh means i'm being sarcastic here
[02:11:34.680 --> 02:11:39.240]  so now the blm says they're going to grab the red river
[02:11:39.240 --> 02:11:43.240]  and they'll get more so now they're moving into texas just declaring it's
[02:11:43.240 --> 02:11:45.720]  all theirs and let's go ahead and play this report and i'm going back to your
[02:11:45.720 --> 02:11:49.800]  phone calls here is that report how can blm come in
[02:11:49.800 --> 02:11:53.560]  and say hey this isn't yours even though it was patented from the state
[02:11:53.560 --> 02:11:57.160]  you've always paid taxes on it our families paid taxes for over a hundred
[02:11:57.160 --> 02:12:00.360]  years on this place we've got a deed to it but yet
[02:12:00.360 --> 02:12:04.600]  they walked in and said it wasn't ours ever since the louisiana purchase in
[02:12:04.600 --> 02:12:07.640]  1803 there has been controversy over where
[02:12:07.640 --> 02:12:12.200]  oklahoma ends and texas begins in layman's terms the boundary is the
[02:12:12.200 --> 02:12:15.240]  vegetation line on the south side of the red river
[02:12:15.240 --> 02:12:19.000]  over time the river moves this movement north towards oklahoma
[02:12:19.000 --> 02:12:23.560]  is the sticking point the sandy soils erode in a process called accretion
[02:12:23.560 --> 02:12:27.480]  which wipes out the bank so the property line follows the river
[02:12:27.480 --> 02:12:31.560]  but blm claims that the river moved by another process called a vulsion
[02:12:31.560 --> 02:12:34.600]  with a vulsion the land may be changed by flood or currents
[02:12:34.600 --> 02:12:39.160]  but the property line isn't so blm claims when the river moved back north
[02:12:39.160 --> 02:12:43.000]  the property line stayed put it doesn't help that oklahoma defines a
[02:12:43.000 --> 02:12:48.200]  vulsion differently than texas and the us originally here the river was
[02:12:48.200 --> 02:12:51.560]  after i don't know i'm trying to play it all i want to go to your calls
[02:12:51.560 --> 02:12:54.520]  look but listen it's all over the news in oklahoma it's on right part it's on
[02:12:54.520 --> 02:12:57.960]  drudgereport.com right now
[02:12:57.960 --> 02:13:02.040]  that all over the country they're not just claiming the waterways
[02:13:02.040 --> 02:13:05.560]  the mississippi every hundred years or so might move 20 miles sometimes
[02:13:05.560 --> 02:13:09.400]  are they going to claim wherever the river moves in that process is theirs
[02:13:09.400 --> 02:13:14.680]  yes they are and now they're claiming large areas
[02:13:14.680 --> 02:13:18.520]  thousands of acres of this guy's property that he has a deed to is theirs
[02:13:18.520 --> 02:13:22.120]  because they claim all the rivers in this country
[02:13:22.120 --> 02:13:25.880]  there's no end to these landgrabbers folks
[02:13:25.880 --> 02:13:30.600]  it doesn't matter you got a deed buddy they got guns and they'll kill you
[02:13:30.600 --> 02:13:35.560]  because they're god government's god that's what america's all about right
[02:13:35.560 --> 02:13:42.760]  just turn your property over to them you evil oklahoma larry in michigan
[02:13:42.760 --> 02:13:47.080]  you're on the air go ahead yeah hi there alex
[02:13:47.080 --> 02:13:52.440]  you know i've been watching this crime bunny stuff and but i've never
[02:13:52.440 --> 02:13:56.200]  heard anybody talk about these so-called cowboys
[02:13:56.200 --> 02:13:59.800]  they give them almost a million dollars for these professional
[02:13:59.800 --> 02:14:05.880]  cowboys to come in and take uh rustle their cattle but
[02:14:05.880 --> 02:14:09.960]  cowboys wouldn't run cattle to death they wouldn't go out and shoot prize
[02:14:09.960 --> 02:14:13.160]  bulls you know by the way listen even their fake
[02:14:13.160 --> 02:14:17.160]  court orders said they couldn't kill cows and they vandalized all the water
[02:14:17.160 --> 02:14:19.640]  tanks they weren't authorized to do that the pipes
[02:14:19.640 --> 02:14:23.400]  and shot his prized cows on purpose because that's what they are is a much
[02:14:23.400 --> 02:14:29.000]  of scum professional cowboy i guarantee if the blm
[02:14:29.000 --> 02:14:32.360]  would have walked over to people politely i've seen all the videos
[02:14:32.360 --> 02:14:35.960]  and said listen there's a court order don't try to go in there and get the
[02:14:35.960 --> 02:14:38.760]  cows or we're gonna we're gonna get in trouble uh

[02:14:44.760 --> 02:14:49.080]  everybody would turn around and left they'd ended up getting bundy's land
[02:14:49.080 --> 02:14:52.120]  but the pointing guns and the sticking their chest out
[02:14:52.120 --> 02:14:55.000]  i mean when those cops in that boat pulled up to me sticking their chest out
[02:14:55.000 --> 02:14:59.720]  and bugging their eyes out i sort of you know just doing it back to them
[02:14:59.720 --> 02:15:02.680]  and then they had to laugh and see how stupid they were and pulling around
[02:15:02.680 --> 02:15:06.760]  laughing but that's they're told go out and
[02:15:06.760 --> 02:15:10.120]  dominate our food let the american people know

[02:15:31.560 --> 02:15:37.960]  hey alex hey brother can you hear yep um i had a just a couple things i wanted
[02:15:37.960 --> 02:15:42.440]  to touch on was um you were talking about reaching people in
[02:15:42.440 --> 02:15:46.360]  other countries and everything i've been following the bundy thing on their
[02:15:46.360 --> 02:15:50.920]  web page and they're getting they're getting tons of people from
[02:15:50.920 --> 02:15:54.360]  all kinds of countries and they were live that
[02:15:54.360 --> 02:15:58.120]  after a celebration thing that night also
[02:15:58.120 --> 02:16:01.880]  uh a lot of people are interested in what's going on here
[02:16:01.880 --> 02:16:05.240]  that's right i mean this thing's perfect people are celebrating defeat of the
[02:16:05.240 --> 02:16:08.760]  tyrants they're celebrating liberty they're celebrating walking towards the
[02:16:08.760 --> 02:16:11.880]  guns this is courage this is honor this is just
[02:16:11.880 --> 02:16:15.720]  the people barely pushing back after bending over to everything
[02:16:15.720 --> 02:16:21.000]  and the statist are pulling their hair out as they sit on top of plunging
[02:16:21.000 --> 02:16:27.080]  ratings yeah um i have a question for you maybe
[02:16:27.080 --> 02:16:31.400]  you could answer for me i'm i put together a video i'm
[02:16:31.400 --> 02:16:37.480]  i'm a laskin indian but um i got this brilliant idea that if
[02:16:37.480 --> 02:16:44.760]  you could get the uh tribes to activate that uh in a situation
[02:16:44.760 --> 02:16:51.240]  like bundy's where they needed uh people the tribes could make these calls to
[02:16:51.240 --> 02:16:55.400]  other tribes they could activate several thousand people in a real short
[02:16:55.400 --> 02:16:58.760]  order of time but what i'm running into i mean i used
[02:16:58.760 --> 02:17:03.080]  one of your russell means uh videos part of it
[02:17:03.080 --> 02:17:09.400]  uh but i'm running into a lot of tribes don't seem to think they're
[02:17:09.400 --> 02:17:14.040]  involved and my question i guess you is if these guys
[02:17:14.040 --> 02:17:19.720]  get lucky and and do take over marshal or whatever how will that affect
[02:17:19.720 --> 02:17:23.240]  uh people like the indian nation and stuff well
[02:17:23.240 --> 02:17:27.720]  well that's true i mean listen listen the british develop concentration camps
[02:17:27.720 --> 02:17:33.000]  that term look it up folks in the 17 and 60 17 and 1800s
[02:17:33.000 --> 02:17:37.400]  they used them all over again in africa in england in scotland
[02:17:37.400 --> 02:17:41.080]  uh and in europe and then over here in north america
[02:17:41.080 --> 02:17:44.600]  so the reservation was really a concentration camp
[02:17:44.600 --> 02:17:49.080]  developed by the british to break a general population
[02:17:49.080 --> 02:17:52.040]  uh so they wouldn't say they were morally killing the men when the children
[02:17:52.040 --> 02:17:55.080]  they would just put you behind fences so you starve to death then those were
[02:17:55.080 --> 02:17:57.800]  used in the civil war by both sides against each other
[02:17:57.800 --> 02:18:01.240]  uh as well but the british wrote the book on concentration camps
[02:18:01.240 --> 02:18:04.280]  and so what russell means says in that great video titled
[02:18:04.280 --> 02:18:07.000]  you know we're all in the reservation now i think the title
[02:18:07.000 --> 02:18:09.800]  is that regardless the wrongs done against native americans
[02:18:09.800 --> 02:18:13.640]  nobody can debate that the new fake liberals and others act like they speak
[02:18:13.640 --> 02:18:16.920]  for the natives the point is the very same screw jobs
[02:18:16.920 --> 02:18:19.480]  that were brought down on the native americans that are still being brought
[02:18:19.480 --> 02:18:23.160]  down on them is now going to be visited on everyone
[02:18:23.160 --> 02:18:25.400]  everything you see that's been done to the natives
[02:18:25.400 --> 02:18:29.000]  is what's being done to everyone else it's what agenda 21 is putting us in
[02:18:29.000 --> 02:18:32.520]  small areas may look sharecroppers goes back to the
[02:18:32.520 --> 02:18:35.800]  romans how do you keep people on the land and in
[02:18:35.800 --> 02:18:39.560]  debt if they're not actually a slave uh well
[02:18:39.560 --> 02:18:43.720]  they had romans that became sharecroppers about 2000 years ago
[02:18:43.720 --> 02:18:47.880]  so the roman practice of sharecropping is still alive in america today
[02:18:47.880 --> 02:18:52.200]  there's a sharecropping ranch right next to our ranch that's been there
[02:18:52.200 --> 02:18:59.160]  for 160 years and it's the same family running it
[02:18:59.160 --> 02:19:03.800]  the same family running it so i hope that answers your questions sir
[02:19:03.800 --> 02:19:06.760]  we're all sharecroppers we're all native americans
[02:19:06.760 --> 02:19:10.280]  we are all going to be treated just like black people where
[02:19:10.280 --> 02:19:13.960]  the tyrants will do it to whatever group they can get away with it so they
[02:19:13.960 --> 02:19:16.520]  can beat the indians they'll do it if they can get blacks and get folks to
[02:19:16.520 --> 02:19:19.320]  convince that they don't have the same rights they'll do it to them
[02:19:19.320 --> 02:19:23.080]  or if they can bring drugs in and then people are dumb enough to use them
[02:19:23.080 --> 02:19:26.600]  oh well if you use drugs we can take your house see they
[02:19:26.600 --> 02:19:30.760]  they always bring in some excuse oh the bible says blacks are cursed so
[02:19:30.760 --> 02:19:34.200]  they deserve to be slaves you know the bottle doesn't say that but it's
[02:19:34.200 --> 02:19:37.400]  always some excuse or the you know the natives are
[02:19:37.400 --> 02:19:40.280]  sabbages so they deserve to have their land taken
[02:19:40.280 --> 02:19:45.480]  it's always the same story the only differences with manifest destiny
[02:19:45.480 --> 02:19:50.520]  is that there were a lot of other complex factors and they weren't trying
[02:19:50.520 --> 02:19:53.160]  to exterminate everyone they just wanted to exterminate the natives and that was
[02:19:53.160 --> 02:19:55.960]  bad enough now the globalists want to exterminate everyone
[02:19:55.960 --> 02:20:01.160]  because they've stolen the world we'll be right back

[02:25:23.160 --> 02:25:27.960]  jacari jackson's special report on the boston bombing the true story of the
[02:25:27.960 --> 02:25:30.680]  boston bombing we played the first four minutes yesterday
[02:25:30.680 --> 02:25:33.960]  a 16 minute segment's coming up the next segment then david knight
[02:25:33.960 --> 02:25:37.720]  is going to tie the bundy ranch into all the other farmers and ranchers and
[02:25:37.720 --> 02:25:41.480]  fisheries being shut down all over the united states
[02:25:41.480 --> 02:25:45.000]  so only the globalists can operate true feudalism
[02:25:45.000 --> 02:25:49.800]  let's talk to mark in california thanks for holding her on the air
[02:25:49.800 --> 02:25:53.640]  yeah three things i want you to embellish the judge that ruled
[02:25:53.640 --> 02:25:56.920]  that this uh it was a conspiracy conspire
[02:25:56.920 --> 02:26:01.160]  criminal conspiracy by china to take away the ranchers lands
[02:26:01.160 --> 02:26:04.840]  and then also for the listeners to go to their city councils
[02:26:04.840 --> 02:26:08.280]  i sat for uh four hours in front of mine and that
[02:26:08.280 --> 02:26:12.280]  in san jose and chuck reed they only gave me a minute but i brought a sign
[02:26:12.280 --> 02:26:15.240]  down there several times it says google john de camp alex
[02:26:15.240 --> 02:26:20.680]  jones the franklin cover-up and uh then uh another thing is that the city
[02:26:20.680 --> 02:26:25.960]  council is talking to in san jose to the various citizens
[02:26:25.960 --> 02:26:30.440]  uh about various issues that the policemen told me to sit down and shut up
[02:26:30.440 --> 02:26:35.000]  so i did that when i got up i mentioned that that policemen told me to sit down
[02:26:35.000 --> 02:26:38.280]  and to shut up for mark trout to sit down and shut up
[02:26:38.280 --> 02:26:41.880]  is exact words and oh yeah everywhere they're telling people they can't even
[02:26:41.880 --> 02:26:44.920]  have the three minutes of communication because job number one is to keep the
[02:26:44.920 --> 02:26:47.080]  scum down get ready to collapse the dollar and
[02:26:47.080 --> 02:26:50.120]  still the pension funds and they got to teach you not to be uppity when that
[02:26:50.120 --> 02:26:54.680]  happens yeah now this was a judge that ruled
[02:26:54.680 --> 02:26:58.280]  this conspiracy conspire uh criminal conspiracy
[02:26:58.280 --> 02:27:02.680]  with red china correct no no listen i appreciate your call no last year
[02:27:02.680 --> 02:27:06.920]  in nevada federal judge jones there's an article up at info wars.com ruled
[02:27:06.920 --> 02:27:11.400]  the blm for the last 20 years was in a criminal conspiracy to bankrupt the
[02:27:11.400 --> 02:27:14.840]  ranchers of the state to take their land
[02:27:14.840 --> 02:27:18.600]  okay federal judge blm in gauge in a criminal conspiracy against ranchers
[02:27:18.600 --> 02:27:22.280]  that's about the blm it doesn't deal with the bundy case even though he was
[02:27:22.280 --> 02:27:26.200]  part of the overall situation what proves china's involved is the blm
[02:27:26.200 --> 02:27:29.080]  documents all right he called for my forget which
[02:27:29.080 --> 02:27:32.040]  affiliate i should plug these stations that was the one out in santa
[02:27:32.040 --> 02:27:35.320]  cruz uh let's talk to uh mike and illinois

[02:27:44.680 --> 02:27:48.360]  brother thanks for calling well here's a couple things
[02:27:48.360 --> 02:27:51.560]  you know i listen to you every day it's often as i can
[02:27:51.560 --> 02:27:57.480]  um it almost seems like uh you're being optimistic about you know like what we
[02:27:57.480 --> 02:28:00.760]  can do because it seems like you know like that beyond
[02:28:00.760 --> 02:28:06.760]  blm standoff in abadda i mean that could have been totally different
[02:28:06.760 --> 02:28:10.680]  you know and then what well you know then they shoot a bunch innocent people
[02:28:10.680 --> 02:28:14.360]  and we have the big victory um
[02:28:14.360 --> 02:28:17.400]  grabbing the courage in the start of the new physical civil war
[02:28:17.400 --> 02:28:21.080]  we're already being attacked i don't want a physical civil war i want freedom
[02:28:21.080 --> 02:28:25.000]  for those blm people and everybody else the government's out of control no one
[02:28:25.000 --> 02:28:28.840]  can deny it a lot of people are scared now and realize how real this is so they've
[02:28:28.840 --> 02:28:31.400]  decided to join with the government and say
[02:28:31.400 --> 02:28:35.080]  any civil disobedience is terrorism well i don't agree with that and i didn't
[02:28:35.080 --> 02:28:38.840]  want violence to happen but when you got the feds threatened to shoot people
[02:28:38.840 --> 02:28:41.880]  the fact that some folks were there and had guns that's what the second amendment
[02:28:41.880 --> 02:28:45.160]  is for and so we're not the ones engaging in
[02:28:45.160 --> 02:28:49.080]  the violence we don't want this to happen and believe me the feds are freaked
[02:28:49.080 --> 02:28:51.640]  out right now they thought everybody would turn back being
[02:28:51.640 --> 02:28:55.800]  threatened to be shot they weren't and that's a lesson for them
[02:28:55.800 --> 02:29:00.120]  we're going to make the french resistance look like
[02:29:00.120 --> 02:29:05.800]  a literal cakewalk okay and and it doesn't matter how many lemmings they've
[02:29:05.800 --> 02:29:08.360]  got going along with it i don't want it to go to that
[02:29:08.360 --> 02:29:11.960]  i want to fix things the globalists want to have a civil war
[02:29:11.960 --> 02:29:15.000]  not that they'll even win it but it's better than them losing everything
[02:29:15.000 --> 02:29:17.640]  politically before they're a cornered my friend
[02:29:17.640 --> 02:29:21.240]  they're going to pull something and people are tired of i mean
[02:29:21.240 --> 02:29:25.000]  was bunny supposed to go bankrupt and go climb a ditch what do you think
[02:29:25.000 --> 02:29:29.640]  well i think the whole thing was bs i mean i agree ridiculous

[02:33:20.600 --> 02:33:23.640]  report from jacquard jackson about the boston bombing this is the one-year
[02:33:23.640 --> 02:33:27.640]  anniversary but i want you to see the kind of police state that is still going
[02:33:27.640 --> 02:33:30.920]  on this is a story that's linked on the dredge report on the right hand side of
[02:33:30.920 --> 02:33:33.960]  the dredge report a video of tsa agents patting down
[02:33:33.960 --> 02:33:38.040]  two and six year old children this is a video the child appears to say something
[02:33:38.040 --> 02:33:42.040]  like i i need to go and is clearly uncomfortable with the pat down
[02:33:42.040 --> 02:33:45.800]  as they should be this is nothing but child molestation
[02:33:45.800 --> 02:33:49.960]  in the phony name of security and this is something that they were supposed to
[02:33:49.960 --> 02:33:54.120]  have stopped doing years and years ago but this is a kind of police state that
[02:33:54.120 --> 02:33:57.720]  people are embracing in the aftermath of the boston bombing here's
[02:33:57.720 --> 02:34:03.160]  jacquard's report we're live it's 208 central
[02:34:03.160 --> 02:34:10.440]  and two explosions at boston marathon people hurt in large explosions oh man
[02:34:10.440 --> 02:34:15.240]  oh my gosh and that old uh i mean we're blaming on iran blaming on the patriot
[02:34:15.240 --> 02:34:20.440]  group or is it going to be a veteran or something i mean this is just so horrible
[02:34:20.440 --> 02:34:24.840]  uh and uh again i hope nobody's really been hurt bad and also hope it's a
[02:34:24.840 --> 02:34:28.920]  gas main uh or or something like that
[02:34:28.920 --> 02:34:32.760]  uh because they will again they're going to turn all public events first it's
[02:34:32.760 --> 02:34:37.240]  have checkpoints at the airport then it's the mall then it's the
[02:34:37.240 --> 02:34:41.720]  sports stadium then it's the hotel then it's the highway then it's the bus
[02:34:41.720 --> 02:34:46.040]  station is already in austin uh then it's army at the kite festival
[02:34:46.040 --> 02:34:50.520]  uh then it's oh any event has to have you know troops at it
[02:34:50.520 --> 02:34:55.240]  drudge now running the headline explosions at boston marathon and it goes
[02:34:55.240 --> 02:34:59.880]  multiple people injured at least a dozen injured uh after explosion
[02:34:59.880 --> 02:35:03.880]  i mean i hope this isn't a false flag or a real terror attack richard
[02:35:03.880 --> 02:35:07.560]  even if it's innocent they will use it because
[02:35:07.560 --> 02:35:11.240]  everyone's focused on it now and people can
[02:35:11.240 --> 02:35:16.440]  be controlled when they're all on the same emotion at the same time
[02:35:16.440 --> 02:35:19.240]  you know the government's been studying this since you know world war one
[02:35:19.240 --> 02:35:23.720]  pulling cat let's fade this out there's a whole process underway right now but
[02:35:23.720 --> 02:35:27.800]  the reality of the situation is it is almost impossible
[02:35:27.800 --> 02:35:33.640]  to protect an event especially one that is over a protracted space as a
[02:35:33.640 --> 02:35:37.320]  marathonist and you know i i hate to say it but these are the
[02:35:37.320 --> 02:35:41.160]  times that we live in uh richard that's what they're saying on singing in
[02:35:41.160 --> 02:35:45.080]  uh so they're already basically saying it's a terror attack oh my goodness
[02:35:45.080 --> 02:35:49.000]  we're helpless is what he's saying i know this they got tsa ready to roll
[02:35:49.000 --> 02:35:52.040]  out nationwide they're already doing it but they've they've been a
[02:35:52.040 --> 02:35:55.960]  i've talked to insiders they're gonna be everywhere now just federal check
[02:35:55.960 --> 02:35:59.320]  points when he said you know unfortunately these are times
[02:35:59.320 --> 02:36:03.560]  we live in so then when we sit when we see soldiers
[02:36:03.560 --> 02:36:07.160]  that our kids literally game we see soldiers
[02:36:07.160 --> 02:36:11.000]  you know everywhere well we're supposed to feel safe
[02:36:11.000 --> 02:36:15.240]  but again the explosion the main one there at the marathon sports and then you
[02:36:15.240 --> 02:36:19.720]  can hear after that Paula it's just absolutely
[02:36:19.720 --> 02:36:22.840]  heartbreaking to see this it's been a year since the bomb attack at the
[02:36:22.840 --> 02:36:25.960]  boston marathon info wars was pointing out the
[02:36:25.960 --> 02:36:29.880]  inconsistencies in the story from the very beginning was there any playing
[02:36:29.880 --> 02:36:32.440]  dollar joke because according to boston globe dot com
[02:36:32.440 --> 02:36:35.320]  they said they were doing drills this morning for the same exact thing that
[02:36:35.320 --> 02:36:38.680]  happened according to boston globe dot com now was used guys giving any warning
[02:36:38.680 --> 02:36:42.600]  ahead of time of this taking place as i said earlier there was no specific
[02:36:42.600 --> 02:36:46.120]  intelligence oh sir why would a lot of speakers telling people in the audience
[02:36:46.120 --> 02:36:48.920]  stuff become moments before the bomb went off
[02:36:48.920 --> 02:36:52.120]  is this another false flight stage attack to take our civil liberties and put
[02:36:52.120 --> 02:36:55.400]  more homeland security i was taking the hands down on the pants on the streets
[02:36:55.400 --> 02:36:59.480]  no and it wasn't just the boston globe who reported the drills
[02:36:59.480 --> 02:37:05.160]  there was dogs with their handlers going around sniffing
[02:37:05.160 --> 02:37:09.320]  um for explosives and and we were told on a
[02:37:09.320 --> 02:37:14.920]  um loud announcement that we shouldn't be concerned if it was just a drill
[02:37:14.920 --> 02:37:21.960]  so maybe maybe it was just a drill um but i've just never seen a drill like
[02:37:21.960 --> 02:37:24.680]  that the most show of force that a track coach
[02:37:24.680 --> 02:37:29.720]  has seen in a lifetime of marathons this brings up questions of prior knowledge
[02:37:29.720 --> 02:37:33.800]  and on the subject of prior knowledge we found out that the cia
[02:37:33.800 --> 02:37:38.440]  fbi and dhs knew of tamalins arnaev before the bombing
[02:37:38.440 --> 02:37:42.600]  reports show that the elders arnaev had previously attended a workshop sponsored
[02:37:42.600 --> 02:37:45.880]  by the cia the word is also out that the fbi and
[02:37:45.880 --> 02:37:49.720]  department of homeland security had been tipped to tamalins visit to a radical
[02:37:49.720 --> 02:37:54.040]  mosque in dagestan a neighbor of chetsnia the fbi felt that this was of
[02:37:54.040 --> 02:37:57.080]  little consequence and didn't consider him a threat
[02:37:57.080 --> 02:38:01.800]  also the suspects uncle ruslan who quickly distanced himself from his nephews
[02:38:01.800 --> 02:38:06.600]  worked for usaid as the article points out the us agency for international
[02:38:06.600 --> 02:38:09.800]  development is an agency used by the u.s government
[02:38:09.800 --> 02:38:14.440]  to operate humanitarian ngos instrumental in running color revolutions
[02:38:14.440 --> 02:38:18.280]  in former soviet states and he just so happened to be the
[02:38:18.280 --> 02:38:22.520]  relative of choice for state-run media i understand that there must be
[02:38:22.520 --> 02:38:25.800]  several criminals and other people on us data banks
[02:38:25.800 --> 02:38:29.320]  especially with the dhs putting toddlers on the no fly list
[02:38:29.320 --> 02:38:33.240]  but if you have a suspect who the russian government warned you about
[02:38:33.240 --> 02:38:37.720]  attended cia backed workshops that the dhs was briefed on
[02:38:37.720 --> 02:38:42.840]  and the fbi interviewed why does the fbi need public assistance identifying the
[02:38:42.840 --> 02:38:47.000]  suspect not to mention how the feds reportedly called this arnaev brothers
[02:38:47.000 --> 02:38:50.520]  after the bombing and before any other incidents
[02:38:50.520 --> 02:38:53.800]  somebody out there knows these individuals as friends
[02:38:53.800 --> 02:38:57.960]  neighbors co-workers or family members of the suspects
[02:38:57.960 --> 02:39:01.720]  though it may be difficult the nation is counting on those with information
[02:39:01.720 --> 02:39:06.760]  to come forward and provide it to us did you ask any of your co-workers their
[02:39:06.760 --> 02:39:11.080]  agents aside from stonewall and info wars reported dan badandi
[02:39:11.080 --> 02:39:15.320]  goons got in his face for dare asking real questions
[02:39:15.320 --> 02:39:19.720]  are both suspects seen planting these devices after the finish line of the
[02:39:19.720 --> 02:39:23.640]  ball of america? no sir the only one who was
[02:39:23.640 --> 02:39:27.000]  observed planting what we believe to be the device is suspect number two with a
[02:39:27.000 --> 02:39:29.640]  white cap let's talk about those photos
[02:39:29.640 --> 02:39:33.720]  bomb drills Monday morning we got photographs and info wars dot com photos
[02:39:33.720 --> 02:39:38.360]  of cars next question please jahar's white or gray backpack with the black
[02:39:38.360 --> 02:39:41.880]  stripes is clearly not the black backpack with the white or gray
[02:39:41.880 --> 02:39:45.320]  stripes that exploded in fact the bags are the exact
[02:39:45.320 --> 02:39:48.840]  opposite the only official photos that should be officially relied upon
[02:39:48.840 --> 02:39:52.280]  in this investigation are those you see before you today so what's the possible
[02:39:52.280 --> 02:39:55.240]  explanation for these bizarro backpacks
[02:39:55.240 --> 02:39:59.000]  and you're carrying a bag this is a light color
[02:39:59.000 --> 02:40:03.080]  like number two had yeah and then it's easy enough for you to go ahead and
[02:40:03.080 --> 02:40:06.840]  take out the actual device that may
[02:40:06.840 --> 02:40:11.320]  help house the weapon there's one theory doubt of the official story could
[02:40:11.320 --> 02:40:15.000]  easily been squashed by releasing footage of the bomb being placed
[02:40:15.000 --> 02:40:17.960]  footage that even governor devol patrick hasn't seen
[02:40:17.960 --> 02:40:23.080]  well the the videotape is not something i've seen has been described to me
[02:40:23.080 --> 02:40:28.680]  but it does seem to to be pretty clear that
[02:40:28.680 --> 02:40:35.400]  that this suspect took the backpack off put it down
[02:40:35.400 --> 02:40:38.440]  and that brings up another piece of questionable footage
[02:40:38.440 --> 02:40:42.840]  who was the naked man info wars reported david night contacted marette
[02:40:42.840 --> 02:40:47.160]  sarnef the onto the suspects who identify the stripped man as her
[02:40:47.160 --> 02:40:51.320]  nephew tamerlin hello is this merit

[02:41:12.840 --> 02:41:17.240]  even before the names of how boys were put out there

[02:42:03.160 --> 02:42:06.920]  ignored by the media the outlets that did pick up the naked man to arrest
[02:42:06.920 --> 02:42:10.760]  quickly wrote him off as somebody who was not really a suspect in the first
[02:42:10.760 --> 02:42:13.560]  place before we go any further let's talk
[02:42:13.560 --> 02:42:16.360]  about what the brothers allegedly did after the bombing
[02:42:16.360 --> 02:42:20.120]  aside from reportedly talking to the fbi as we mentioned earlier
[02:42:20.120 --> 02:42:23.080]  the story goes that the two had a seemingly normal life
[02:42:23.080 --> 02:42:27.240]  jihar went back to school but after being named suspects the brothers went on
[02:42:27.240 --> 02:42:30.520]  the run and allegedly killed an mit officer to get his
[02:42:30.520 --> 02:42:34.680]  gun thus the story goes to date there is no dna evidence
[02:42:34.680 --> 02:42:38.520]  or public photographic evidence that the brothers actually killed the officer
[02:42:38.520 --> 02:42:41.720]  in his patrol car and just like with the placing of the bomb
[02:42:41.720 --> 02:42:45.640]  the authorities want you to believe in footage that they refuse to show you
[02:42:45.640 --> 02:42:49.720]  so where did this story come from it's a theory that the brothers wanted a
[02:42:49.720 --> 02:42:52.280]  gun and targeted someone who would have one
[02:42:52.280 --> 02:42:55.880]  but whoever killed officer collier didn't bother to take his weapon
[02:42:55.880 --> 02:42:59.720]  now let me be very clear this is in no way to tarnish the image of the slain
[02:42:59.720 --> 02:43:02.760]  officer all due respect to him and his family
[02:43:02.760 --> 02:43:05.800]  i'm simply pointing out how hearsay surrounding his death
[02:43:05.800 --> 02:43:09.720]  is now considered gospel but what about the carjacking victim
[02:43:09.720 --> 02:43:13.560]  didn't the brothers confess to him well there are conflicting narratives
[02:43:13.560 --> 02:43:17.240]  concerning that too briefly the carjacking victim known as
[02:43:17.240 --> 02:43:20.360]  danie reported a movie like escape from the zarnaev brothers
[02:43:20.360 --> 02:43:24.520]  but before he got away danie says tamalin confessed to killing the mit
[02:43:24.520 --> 02:43:28.920]  officer as well as a role in the bombing contrast that with an earlier
[02:43:28.920 --> 02:43:32.600]  interview where danie says tamalin mentioned the bombing but said nothing
[02:43:32.600 --> 02:43:36.280]  of the mit shooting draw your own conclusion there
[02:43:36.280 --> 02:43:41.240]  oh and the 7-11 robbery that took place that wasn't the zarnaev brothers
[02:43:41.240 --> 02:43:44.360]  when the government and the shadow government has been gearing up
[02:43:44.360 --> 02:43:48.920]  to roll out and be our savior and and and and they stand to gain from it it's
[02:43:48.920 --> 02:43:52.120]  obvious i mean wherever the suspect is the government
[02:43:52.120 --> 02:43:56.360]  will appropriate it and create a narrative
[02:43:56.360 --> 02:44:00.760]  and and 90 percent of it probably i'm just guessing
[02:44:00.760 --> 02:44:04.440]  will be a fabrication to shape our thought of
[02:44:04.440 --> 02:44:09.560]  police and military and safety and they're licking their chops they're now
[02:44:09.560 --> 02:44:13.240]  saying were their right wing or patriot meetings in the area
[02:44:13.240 --> 02:44:17.640]  uh-oh oh oh man and that's singing in doing that
[02:44:17.640 --> 02:44:23.160]  oh wolf blitzer we are in trouble oh man i bet they even dragged me into it with
[02:44:23.160 --> 02:44:26.680]  my 1776 line
[02:44:32.520 --> 02:44:35.880]  that was footage from the quote shootout between the zarnaev brothers
[02:44:35.880 --> 02:44:39.560]  and the police this is one of the most contradictory moments following the
[02:44:39.560 --> 02:44:43.160]  bombing with various witnesses contesting whether or not the suspects
[02:44:43.160 --> 02:44:46.760]  tossed bombs at the police whether or not an officer was injured by friendly
[02:44:46.760 --> 02:44:51.320]  fire and whether or not jihar ran over tamalin if the naked man is tamalin's
[02:44:51.320 --> 02:44:55.480]  our naev as his aunt claims then the official story has much to explain as
[02:44:55.480 --> 02:44:59.640]  to how a bullet wounded man was struck by a car and appears virtually
[02:44:59.640 --> 02:45:02.520]  uninjured regardless of what happened after the
[02:45:02.520 --> 02:45:06.440]  confrontation with the police jihar is able to go and hide himself in a boat
[02:45:06.440 --> 02:45:09.640]  and tamalin is taken into custody according to his aunt
[02:45:09.640 --> 02:45:12.600]  the police state rolled into water town with a vengeance
[02:45:12.600 --> 02:45:17.640]  intimidating media forcing people out of their homes at gunpoint
[02:45:17.640 --> 02:45:24.600]  door to door armed searches without warrant police don't need
[02:45:24.600 --> 02:45:31.720]  warrants if property owners welcome them into their homes
[02:45:31.720 --> 02:45:38.920]  families thrown out of their homes at gunpoint to be searched without probable
[02:45:38.920 --> 02:45:46.280]  cause no guns were pointed at any families let's watch that clip again
[02:45:46.280 --> 02:45:49.880]  covered by footage of what actually happened
[02:45:49.880 --> 02:45:56.920]  door to door armed searches without warrant police don't need
[02:45:56.920 --> 02:46:03.960]  warrants if property owners welcome them into their homes
[02:46:03.960 --> 02:46:11.240]  families thrown out of their homes at gunpoint to be searched without probable
[02:46:11.240 --> 02:46:18.600]  cause no guns were pointed at any families but as you saw with your own
[02:46:18.600 --> 02:46:22.840]  eyes people were forced out of their homes and had guns pointed at them
[02:46:22.840 --> 02:46:26.600]  in the end it was a homeowner who called the police to report suspicious
[02:46:26.600 --> 02:46:31.240]  activity in his boat police responded fired multiple rounds into the boat
[02:46:31.240 --> 02:46:34.680]  and i'm sure we're shocked when jihar was able to climb out of the boat under
[02:46:34.680 --> 02:46:38.040]  his own power he is bloodied but doesn't yet seem to
[02:46:38.040 --> 02:46:41.720]  have the wound in his mouth that would be reported later if he indeed shot
[02:46:41.720 --> 02:46:44.520]  himself through the mouth i doubt he'd be this mobile
[02:46:44.520 --> 02:46:48.600]  and it's a pretty safe bet that he'd be suffering much heavier blood loss
[02:46:48.600 --> 02:46:52.920]  jihar is currently in custody awaiting trial his brother tamalin is now
[02:46:52.920 --> 02:46:56.760]  deceased but even with one suspect dead and another in jail
[02:46:56.760 --> 02:47:00.600]  the story didn't end there an acquaintance of tamalin was
[02:47:00.600 --> 02:47:04.200]  killed during an fbi interrogation the fbi story
[02:47:04.200 --> 02:47:08.040]  changed multiple times as to how their agent felt his life was in danger
[02:47:08.040 --> 02:47:11.800]  whether it was toteshev's martial arts skills or a potential weapon in his
[02:47:11.800 --> 02:47:15.400]  hands the fbi agent shot toteshev execution style
[02:47:15.400 --> 02:47:19.880]  according to toteshev's father info wars talked to toteshev's widow about the
[02:47:19.880 --> 02:47:23.880]  killing that night i was actually in atlanta georgia was
[02:47:23.880 --> 02:47:28.040]  about seven hours away from there was at work when it happened
[02:47:28.040 --> 02:47:32.680]  and um this is not what exactly he said he he felt
[02:47:32.680 --> 02:47:36.280]  strange about it he said this is not the first interview that was coming over
[02:47:36.280 --> 02:47:38.840]  and they called him they told him that's going to be the second of his last
[02:47:38.840 --> 02:47:42.360]  interview the agents from Boston they come in to speak with him
[02:47:42.360 --> 02:47:45.400]  and he said you guys i'm just tired of coming to your office you want to speak
[02:47:45.400 --> 02:47:49.480]  with me you can come to my house and he said that if anything happens to me
[02:47:49.480 --> 02:47:53.640]  just say say don't don't be quiet just say what happened to me if anything
[02:47:53.640 --> 02:47:56.840]  happens he wasn't scared if he would he probably
[02:47:56.840 --> 02:48:00.440]  would not want to speak with them at the first place but since he even invited
[02:48:00.440 --> 02:48:04.360]  him to our home that means he wasn't scared of them
[02:48:04.360 --> 02:48:09.400]  and um they have interviewed him he would not respond
[02:48:09.400 --> 02:48:14.360]  his cell phone or anything and they have his friend waiting him outside but
[02:48:14.360 --> 02:48:18.520]  suddenly they let him go after four hours um
[02:48:18.520 --> 02:48:22.760]  and some of the agents still were still with the Ibrahim and as
[02:48:22.760 --> 02:48:26.680]  right now they've been pulling so many statements that he was armed and he was
[02:48:26.680 --> 02:48:30.360]  unarmed and that he was um his body was a weapon
[02:48:30.360 --> 02:48:34.120]  since he's an MMA fighter but he just had his knee
[02:48:34.120 --> 02:48:38.360]  surgery back in March so he wasn't able to move
[02:48:38.360 --> 02:48:42.120]  pretty quick pretty fast or do anything and um
[02:48:42.120 --> 02:48:46.840]  after we actually after all that happened we when we was able to enter the
[02:48:46.840 --> 02:48:52.120]  house um he had seven shots one was in the back of the head
[02:48:52.120 --> 02:48:56.600]  and it has nothing to do with him uh start attacking them as
[02:48:56.600 --> 02:49:00.360]  as they said they're coming with the knife with the blade with the broom
[02:49:00.360 --> 02:49:06.280]  with the swords I think they um came with the five different statements
[02:49:06.280 --> 02:49:09.400]  um for those who don't know it's important you say that they've now
[02:49:09.400 --> 02:49:13.160]  admitted that he didn't have a weapon didn't attack him so as the runners take
[02:49:13.160 --> 02:49:16.760]  to the streets once again let us not forget all of the lies
[02:49:16.760 --> 02:49:20.040]  have truths disinformation and teleprompter reading
[02:49:20.040 --> 02:49:24.280]  that has hindered justice for all of the victims of April 15th
[02:49:24.280 --> 02:49:29.400]  2013 you can find more reports at info wars.com
[02:49:29.400 --> 02:49:34.920]  Alex Jones may sound crazy but still has 300 million YouTube uh well he had 300
[02:49:34.920 --> 02:49:38.120]  million people that have watched him on YouTube and that's a great report from
[02:49:38.120 --> 02:49:42.040]  Jakari Jackson I want to make it clear that we pointed out at the time and one
[02:49:42.040 --> 02:49:44.760]  of the reasons that they put these guys up as Patsy's
[02:49:44.760 --> 02:49:47.960]  was because we're making it clear at the time that the Southern Poverty Law Center
[02:49:47.960 --> 02:49:51.080]  and the mainstream media mockingbird press and I'm not using that as a
[02:49:51.080 --> 02:49:54.680]  metaphor that's a CIA operation they were setting up
[02:49:54.680 --> 02:49:58.920]  patriots they were going to blame this on quote unquote right wing patriots like
[02:49:58.920 --> 02:50:02.600]  we see them creating that narrative right now at the Bundy Ranch
[02:50:02.600 --> 02:50:05.720]  first they assassinate your character then they assassinate you
[02:50:05.720 --> 02:50:08.360]  we're going to talk about that when we come back we're going to talk about how
[02:50:08.360 --> 02:50:10.920]  they're setting this up and we're also going to talk about

[02:50:18.280 --> 02:50:22.280]  we had Glenn Beck put Mr Bundy on his show
[02:50:22.280 --> 02:50:26.280]  and start pushing the idea that he's part of the sovereign citizen movement
[02:50:26.280 --> 02:50:30.200]  that is a loaded term that's a loaded label that law enforcement has been
[02:50:30.200 --> 02:50:33.240]  trained to perceive as a direct immediate threat to their safety
[02:50:33.240 --> 02:50:36.360]  then three days later we got Harry Reid talking about domestic terrorists now
[02:50:36.360 --> 02:50:39.800]  today we've got MSNBC talking about insurgents
[02:50:39.800 --> 02:50:42.760]  they're keeping the rhetoric they're building it they're trying to create that
[02:50:42.760 --> 02:50:46.760]  narrative we're going to talk to you about that right after the break

[02:54:41.800 --> 02:54:45.800]  against the bundies but before i get into that let's let's repeat this
[02:54:45.800 --> 02:54:50.200]  tsa agents patting down two and six year old children this is a story that's up
[02:54:50.200 --> 02:54:53.160]  on info wars.com it's linked on the drudge report
[02:54:53.160 --> 02:54:57.960]  absolutely amazing and repulsive what they're doing to our children what
[02:54:57.960 --> 02:55:00.600]  we're letting them do to our children listen to this
[02:55:00.600 --> 02:55:05.000]  in response to a huge backlash the tsa amended its policy in 2011 to massively
[02:55:05.000 --> 02:55:07.400]  reduce pat downs of children under the age of 12
[02:55:07.400 --> 02:55:12.760]  infants were allowed to pass through x-ray or body scanners multiple times
[02:55:12.760 --> 02:55:17.000]  if there's any anomaly in order prevent the need for physical search now
[02:55:17.000 --> 02:55:20.760]  okay what are we doing allowing them to search our children to put their hands
[02:55:20.760 --> 02:55:24.040]  all over their bodies clearly in this video the girl that was
[02:55:24.040 --> 02:55:26.840]  having this done to her the six-year-old girl says i've got to go i've got to go
[02:55:26.840 --> 02:55:29.240]  she's not comfortable that she shouldn't be comfortable with that
[02:55:29.240 --> 02:55:33.160]  i'm not comfortable with that david simpson here in texas was not
[02:55:33.160 --> 02:55:37.000]  comfortable with that he put in a bill in 2011 and it
[02:55:37.000 --> 02:55:40.360]  immediately passed in the house and when it got to the senate
[02:55:40.360 --> 02:55:44.920]  dohurst our lieutenant governor who has his previous job description was all
[02:55:44.920 --> 02:55:49.160]  cia stuff these guys walked it back they basically threatened to turn texas into
[02:55:49.160 --> 02:55:51.960]  a no fly zone and we found the documents
[02:55:51.960 --> 02:55:57.160]  john corbett and part of his lawsuit and and discovery he listed
[02:55:57.160 --> 02:56:02.040]  documents that he was allowed to see and basically the government put on pacer
[02:56:02.040 --> 02:56:06.520]  dot gov they listed the unredacted portion of the lawsuit where he quoted
[02:56:06.520 --> 02:56:10.040]  them saying that in 2011 at the same time the threatening to turn
[02:56:10.040 --> 02:56:14.680]  texas into a no fly zone they uh they were saying internally in their own
[02:56:14.680 --> 02:56:19.320]  documents that there was no threat to airplanes or airports the whole thing
[02:56:19.320 --> 02:56:22.040]  was a lie it's a fraud why are we letting them do this to our
[02:56:22.040 --> 02:56:25.240]  children david simpson tried to walk that back not only
[02:56:25.240 --> 02:56:28.600]  then in 2011 but he tried to do it last year both times he lost
[02:56:28.600 --> 02:56:31.880]  thanks to people like david dohurst republican
[02:56:31.880 --> 02:56:35.640]  cia member who walked this thing back now we see it happening again
[02:56:35.640 --> 02:56:39.400]  and why are we allowing our children to be passed through x-ray machines
[02:56:39.400 --> 02:56:42.680]  multiple times so that they don't get touched by these
[02:56:42.680 --> 02:56:46.520]  invasive goons why would we let our kids be passed through x-ray machines
[02:56:46.520 --> 02:56:50.200]  multiple times that's absolutely asinine but i want to get back to this
[02:56:50.200 --> 02:56:53.800]  situation here at the bundy ranch as i mentioned before we see the rhetoric
[02:56:53.800 --> 02:56:57.000]  escalating it was a week ago that glenn beck tried to
[02:56:57.000 --> 02:57:00.920]  pen the label of a sovereign citizen movement on mr bundy and that was not
[02:57:00.920 --> 02:57:04.280]  what he was saying he was saying that the state and local government was sovereign
[02:57:04.280 --> 02:57:07.880]  they should be doing something about this then four days later three days
[02:57:07.880 --> 02:57:11.000]  later on thursday we saw that harry reed uses a term domestic
[02:57:11.000 --> 02:57:13.800]  terrorists clearly a lie clearly over the top
[02:57:13.800 --> 02:57:18.600]  now we've got msnbc calling the people that were there calling the bundy's
[02:57:18.600 --> 02:57:22.760]  insurgents escalating this this is what we saw developing
[02:57:22.760 --> 02:57:26.360]  at the boston bombing last year it was a southern poverty law center that was
[02:57:26.360 --> 02:57:28.840]  coming in and pushing on that at the time as well
[02:57:28.840 --> 02:57:32.440]  oh we think this might be some domestic terrorists this might be right wing
[02:57:32.440 --> 02:57:35.640]  terrorists we started exposing that we started
[02:57:35.640 --> 02:57:39.000]  looking at crowdsourcing investigations pictures that we're putting up
[02:57:39.000 --> 02:57:41.000]  showing how they were setting this thing up and they
[02:57:41.000 --> 02:57:44.280]  canceled their press conferences and went with a different story
[02:57:44.280 --> 02:57:47.960]  using these guys who they'd worked with in the past as patsies that's what i
[02:57:47.960 --> 02:57:51.480]  firmly believe but let's look at what's going on who are the real terrorists
[02:57:51.480 --> 02:57:55.080]  here what we saw at blm i just made a quick list of some of their crimes
[02:57:55.080 --> 02:57:58.840]  assault with deadly weapons as they were training snipers on people who are
[02:57:58.840 --> 02:58:03.240]  unarmed battery of protesters beating them armed
[02:58:03.240 --> 02:58:07.160]  robbery grand larceny denial of civil rights in the free speech areas
[02:58:07.160 --> 02:58:10.520]  impersonating an officer that's right impersonating an officer we have
[02:58:10.520 --> 02:58:14.280]  congressman steve stockman from texas who wrote a letter and said you know
[02:58:14.280 --> 02:58:17.320]  what when you have to use law enforcement
[02:58:17.320 --> 02:58:21.960]  the law says you shall contract with local law enforcement not do it yourself
[02:58:21.960 --> 02:58:39.800]  we're going to be right back in overdrive stay tuned i want to finish this

[03:00:05.880 --> 03:00:10.680]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups

[03:00:30.920 --> 03:00:33.800]  because i wanted to cover a couple of articles that really show
[03:00:33.800 --> 03:00:37.720]  how this is not limited to one rancher this is not something that's even
[03:00:37.720 --> 03:00:40.760]  necessarily limited to ranchers certainly not limited to that specific
[03:00:40.760 --> 03:00:44.200]  ranch take a look at this story out of north carolina we've got north carolina
[03:00:44.200 --> 03:00:47.240]  fish houses are navigating a variety of issues this
[03:00:47.240 --> 03:00:52.040]  is a story from journal now this is a a family business of
[03:00:52.040 --> 03:00:55.000]  fishermen lt everett and sons that ceased operation
[03:00:55.000 --> 03:01:00.600]  december 31st after 67 years in business why were they put out of
[03:01:00.600 --> 03:01:04.120]  business same reason that the ranchers in the
[03:01:04.120 --> 03:01:07.960]  bundy area and bunkerville were put out of business of course
[03:01:07.960 --> 03:01:11.160]  the bundy family has been there for 140 years listen to what happened to these
[03:01:11.160 --> 03:01:14.600]  fishermen who after 67 years in a family business
[03:01:14.600 --> 03:01:17.400]  estelle brothers now who took over from the father
[03:01:17.400 --> 03:01:21.560]  he cited a decrease in product due to state and federal regulations that
[03:01:21.560 --> 03:01:25.000]  affect many of the fish that they sold like sea bass grouper flounder red
[03:01:25.000 --> 03:01:28.360]  drum he said they cut down the allocations we just
[03:01:28.360 --> 03:01:32.600]  couldn't get enough seafood to keep going the regulations intended for the
[03:01:32.600 --> 03:01:37.080]  protection of fish stocks vary by species and can be very complex with harvest
[03:01:37.080 --> 03:01:41.000]  quotas size limits and times of the year you can fish
[03:01:41.000 --> 03:01:44.520]  all being part of the equation that was what was happening
[03:01:44.520 --> 03:01:47.480]  at the bundy ranch they came in when they started this and saying we're going
[03:01:47.480 --> 03:01:50.600]  to protect these endangered species the desert tortoise what they did was they
[03:01:50.600 --> 03:01:53.800]  came in and they cut the allocations by 90 percent
[03:01:53.800 --> 03:01:57.640]  can you keep your business in in effect if your business is immediately cut by
[03:01:57.640 --> 03:02:01.160]  90 percent if they cut it by the times of year taking
[03:02:01.160 --> 03:02:03.880]  your cattle off of the land at the peak times and that's what they're doing to
[03:02:03.880 --> 03:02:07.160]  these fishermen here they're cutting it down and let me explain something to you
[03:02:07.160 --> 03:02:10.360]  when they put these regulations on they're not just putting out
[03:02:10.360 --> 03:02:13.880]  family businesses that have been in business for generations
[03:02:13.880 --> 03:02:17.400]  they're also erecting barriers to make sure that there aren't going to be any
[03:02:17.400 --> 03:02:21.000]  new small businesses that are going to be competing with the multinational
[03:02:21.000 --> 03:02:23.720]  and international businesses that they're protecting listen to this quote
[03:02:23.720 --> 03:02:26.440]  here they say that high fuel prices can make it
[03:02:26.440 --> 03:02:29.640]  unprofitable for fishermen to run their boats for smaller harvest that's right
[03:02:29.640 --> 03:02:32.360]  they have this overhead cost if you cut down the amount of fish that they can
[03:02:32.360 --> 03:02:37.080]  get they can't do that and seafood imports compete with
[03:02:37.080 --> 03:02:41.320]  seafood caught in the united states see in these international waters where
[03:02:41.320 --> 03:02:43.800]  they're going in and fishing and then coming back and selling them in the
[03:02:43.800 --> 03:02:46.600]  united states or bringing them in with open
[03:02:46.600 --> 03:02:49.960]  free trade agreements quote-unquote that they prefer
[03:02:49.960 --> 03:02:54.120]  the international companies they're putting out the small businessman
[03:02:54.120 --> 03:02:58.360]  they're turning us over to the corporate food production
[03:02:58.360 --> 03:03:01.560]  and this is something that is not going to come back
[03:03:01.560 --> 03:03:04.440]  and if you think it's just about businesses and you don't basically like
[03:03:04.440 --> 03:03:07.640]  people who have their own business because maybe you know you
[03:03:07.640 --> 03:03:10.920]  you extrapolate the sins of the giant corporations to the small businessman
[03:03:10.920 --> 03:03:13.480]  in your neighborhood this is not just about that
[03:03:13.480 --> 03:03:17.240]  this is about your food supply they're cutting down the fish
[03:03:17.240 --> 03:03:20.840]  they're cutting down the beef the bundies were raising beef in
[03:03:20.840 --> 03:03:23.800]  open range that's what you want you don't want cattle that's
[03:03:23.800 --> 03:03:28.840]  corralled and fed these uh antibiotics and steroids and everything else that
[03:03:28.840 --> 03:03:32.040]  they give them in the factory farms that's the kind of meat that you want
[03:03:32.040 --> 03:03:35.800]  to eat if you're going to be eating beef but they don't want you eating beef
[03:03:35.800 --> 03:03:39.320]  the southern poverty law center at the same time that you've got the mockingbird
[03:03:39.320 --> 03:03:43.240]  press trying to again demonize these people as
[03:03:43.240 --> 03:03:46.280]  right-wing terrorists the southern poverty law center is trying to tell you
[03:03:46.280 --> 03:03:49.400]  that agenda 21 is a right-wing conspiracy it's not a right-wing
[03:03:49.400 --> 03:03:52.280]  conspiracy it's been mentioned by as as kit daniels
[03:03:52.280 --> 03:03:55.320]  point out this article today and we had an article that we talked about last
[03:03:55.320 --> 03:03:57.880]  night of the nightly news from the new american
[03:03:57.880 --> 03:04:01.720]  they're pointing out that it's it's not a right-wing conspiracy there's been
[03:04:01.720 --> 03:04:05.320]  three states where they've introduced anti-agenda 21 legislation
[03:04:05.320 --> 03:04:10.200]  and alabama it passed unanimously including all of the democrats there
[03:04:10.200 --> 03:04:14.680]  and one of the best books about agenda 21 is by rosa quarry who's a democrat
[03:04:14.680 --> 03:04:19.080]  she's a feminist a lesbian she's always been a democrat but on this
[03:04:19.080 --> 03:04:24.440]  issue she understands what's going on and we see what's happening here in texas
[03:04:24.440 --> 03:04:28.680]  the same type of situation texas only has one and a half percent
[03:04:28.680 --> 03:04:32.680]  of the land controlled by the federal government and they're trying to increase
[03:04:32.680 --> 03:04:35.800]  that now and i don't have time to talk about it but if you look at this
[03:04:35.800 --> 03:04:39.320]  article you'll see that the blm when they confiscated people's lands they go
[03:04:39.320 --> 03:04:42.520]  back to the louisiana purchase of 1803 glenn bett
[03:04:42.520 --> 03:04:46.600]  criticized five monday laughing at him because he's going back to 1864
[03:04:46.600 --> 03:04:50.280]  when it became a state they will use those arguments they are not arcane
[03:04:50.280 --> 03:04:53.640]  and they really do matter in the conclave clause
[03:04:53.640 --> 03:04:56.600]  well that's all we've got time for today we'll be back tomorrow alex will be
[03:04:56.600 --> 03:05:20.600]  back at 11 central noon and we'll have the nightly news side at seven
