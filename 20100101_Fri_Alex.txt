[00:00.000 --> 00:29.960]  Unhappy it is though to reflect that a brother's sword has been sheathed in a
[00:29.960 --> 00:36.200]  brother's breast and that the once happy and peaceful planes of America are
[00:36.200 --> 00:43.920]  either to be drenched with blood or inhabited by slaves sad alternative but
[00:43.920 --> 00:51.000]  can a virtuous man hesitate in his choice George Washington after the
[00:51.000 --> 00:56.240]  battles of Lexington and Concord Washington made this statement that it
[00:56.240 --> 01:02.200]  is better for our land to be drenched in blood than for us to become slaves to
[01:02.200 --> 01:08.120]  our own government he said that in 1776 both those two different quotes from
[01:08.120 --> 01:19.480]  letters our founding fathers knew who the enemy was it was the corrupt out of
[01:19.480 --> 01:27.940]  control bureaucracy filtering and stealing and robbing and grimeing and
[01:27.940 --> 01:33.460]  controlling we have to first identify the illegitimate bankers and have
[01:33.460 --> 01:38.560]  grand juries indict them and have the people expose them and get a spirit of
[01:38.560 --> 01:43.360]  victory and liberty about us to go out now that the people are ready to hear
[01:43.360 --> 01:48.760]  the truth and expose the enemies of the republic if the public is given true
[01:48.760 --> 01:53.200]  leadership and a real choice we can fix this in a nonviolent fashion the
[01:53.200 --> 01:56.840]  globalists will stage some terror attacks and try to bustle around with
[01:56.840 --> 02:01.720]  troops and poses our saviors are trying to nitty us right now they're trying to
[02:01.720 --> 02:06.760]  castrate us right now I don't want a violent confrontation we haven't reached
[02:06.760 --> 02:11.280]  the point that George Washington and reached in Lexington and Concord in
[02:11.280 --> 02:18.760]  1775 and then in 1776 with his shorter statement of that it is better for our
[02:18.760 --> 02:24.360]  land to be drenched in blood than for us to become slaves to our own government
[02:24.360 --> 02:33.200]  we have not reached that point in our fight against these tyrants yet we need
[02:33.200 --> 02:37.440]  to continue with the committees of correspondence to expose these individuals
[02:37.440 --> 02:42.560]  and to go out to the police and military and state the facts of the case and to
[02:42.560 --> 02:49.400]  show people the sides so they may choose choose your destiny wisely you did
[02:49.400 --> 02:53.160]  not know that every man and woman is the captain of their destiny the captain of
[02:53.160 --> 02:59.400]  the choices they make on the road to that destiny you have been taught to be so
[02:59.400 --> 03:05.160]  passive to just accept the world as it is and not realize you are the great
[03:05.160 --> 03:13.240]  captains of your fortune of your destiny I'm going to be covering George

[03:38.480 --> 03:44.240]  the new millennium began in 2001 but again everything's a lie everything's a
[03:44.240 --> 03:50.120]  fraud everything is deliberately defiled every form of reality and fact is
[03:50.120 --> 03:55.560]  deliberately turned on its head so that everything is a confusing jumble it's
[03:55.560 --> 03:58.880]  like going into a studio that has hundreds of wires all tied together and
[03:58.880 --> 04:03.960]  you can't figure it out so you just throw your hands up and walk away there
[04:03.960 --> 04:07.800]  is a method to the madness and the globalists have bragged about it so we're

[08:45.960 --> 08:51.840]  the Capitol then with guns come in an order congressman out the security
[08:51.840 --> 08:57.200]  system is doing the same thing 3,000 years ago that the Chinese ruling
[08:57.200 --> 09:01.840]  dynasty had done to them by their security staff oh you've got to be behind
[09:01.840 --> 09:05.720]  this walled area of the city where you're safe you can't ever go out oh
[09:05.720 --> 09:09.840]  you've got to have your feet bound because you're so pretty you're not

[09:44.480 --> 09:48.880]  City half a mile away from the Federal Reserve at a city park filming it from
[09:48.880 --> 09:53.360]  a distance and guys show up private security guards off their jurisdiction
[09:53.360 --> 09:58.040]  with guns hands-on guns you've seen the video on YouTube Kansas City Star said
[09:58.040 --> 10:02.440]  it was pretty good they said yeah Kansas City Star reporter called me up said
[10:02.440 --> 10:08.440]  kind of what's wrong with that what were they doing at the park but and then they
[10:08.440 --> 10:13.040]  called the Federal Reserve Federal Reserve said we never even did that we
[10:13.040 --> 10:16.400]  know nothing about it all over the country they do the same thing you've
[10:16.400 --> 10:22.240]  got video of it and the news just says it doesn't exist it's basically what
[10:22.240 --> 10:28.480]  ended up happening I see articles every week about the film New World Order
[10:29.280 --> 10:34.040]  made for IFC where it shows us at Bilderberg shows the black limousine
[10:34.040 --> 10:39.040]  shows the Secret Service talking into their rest the dark sunglasses and I
[10:39.040 --> 10:45.440]  saw what the Olympian newspaper at a Washington State last week just said
[10:45.440 --> 10:51.240]  I'm completely delusional I was imagining cars following me imagining this
[10:51.240 --> 10:57.680]  meeting psychology today said that it it doesn't matter if it's all admitted
[10:57.680 --> 11:01.720]  doesn't matter of Rick Perry's in the Dallas Morning News admitting he goes
[11:01.720 --> 11:06.880]  they just don't exist and it's their little funny game they know full well

[11:15.280 --> 11:24.360]  funny I mean one of these yuppies think it's funny
[11:26.760 --> 11:32.040]  they think it's funny playing mind games with people going there's no

[12:15.760 --> 12:21.200]  on a bully starting to fight with me and breaking their nose I get off on helping
[12:21.200 --> 12:25.000]  old ladies across the street I get off on telling the truth I get off on having
[12:25.000 --> 12:34.920]  courage I enjoy being virtuous doesn't mean I'm perfect but I enjoy wanting to
[12:34.920 --> 12:44.320]  be good and these people see that as weak they think it's funny and they wreck
[12:44.320 --> 12:49.880]  society and they always squeal like bloody murder when the system they've
[12:49.880 --> 12:54.240]  conjured up the tyranny they've risen through their evil actions out of the
[12:54.240 --> 12:59.200]  pit of hell that they've conjured when it's tearing them apart they squeal like
[12:59.200 --> 13:03.560]  little pigs all right I'm gonna shut up and get into the other news and then
[13:03.560 --> 13:14.200]  George Washington let's do this now trying to find it I've got my there's
[13:14.200 --> 13:23.200]  just too much I I've got my printout about eco snoop.com and if you guys can
[13:23.200 --> 13:31.640]  get me the eco snoop website up on screen Craig had that I this morning I
[13:31.640 --> 13:42.280]  came in early and we got it up on screen and everything I guess he's not here but
[13:44.080 --> 13:51.360]  eco snoop.com this is a new iPhone application you know we don't have
[13:51.360 --> 13:56.120]  George Searle's funding us with info wars.com applications the few people
[13:56.120 --> 13:58.720]  that have approached us just wanted to do some business deal with us I don't
[13:58.720 --> 14:02.800]  have time to do that somebody wants to give us an application to just stream my
[14:02.800 --> 14:08.160]  radio show and my website we would love to do it give it to us we'll launch it
[14:08.160 --> 14:16.600]  there's millions of these applications we need one instead eco snoop is an
[14:16.600 --> 14:26.800]  application where you go around spying and tattling on your neighbors and oh
[14:26.800 --> 14:30.680]  if an office building has the lights on it doesn't mean someone's working in
[14:30.680 --> 14:37.480]  there at night in an insurance office or in a bank or in a non-profit or in a
[14:37.480 --> 14:41.920]  sprockets manufacturer it doesn't mean that there's people actually work at
[14:41.920 --> 14:49.040]  night in America and all over the world you've been in an office at night the
[14:49.040 --> 14:58.320]  winners are there okay but the but the issue here is that they call it an
[14:58.320 --> 15:03.040]  offense they call it a crime and they have eco cop training for kids in England
[15:03.040 --> 15:12.240]  the US Australia they have TV show in the US called eco cops and it's all
[15:12.240 --> 15:17.520]  packaged in the idea of well we're not big brother we're just helping and we're
[15:17.520 --> 15:20.880]  gonna save you money on your energy and but then you see what people are
[15:20.880 --> 15:27.040]  tattling on it it uploads the iPhone to their site eco snoop and it says stuff
[15:27.040 --> 15:34.280]  in there like garden too long garden not watered or oh look at this gas station
[15:34.280 --> 15:39.840]  they have the lights on yeah it's a foggy rainy day and there's lights on at
[15:39.840 --> 15:48.800]  the gas station as if light and power is evil I want to play a video review of
[15:48.800 --> 15:55.680]  eco snoops for you and again this is only one of no exaggeration 20 30 I
[15:55.680 --> 15:59.960]  don't know things I see a week like this I mean it's just wall-to-wall and while
[15:59.960 --> 16:04.640]  you're at work paying taxes your kids are in the school you paid for being
[16:04.640 --> 16:08.880]  taught that you're bad and to be spied on and they set the precedent with this
[16:08.880 --> 16:14.400]  to get people spying and tattling and filling out dossiers on their parents
[16:14.400 --> 16:18.880]  on their schools on corporations and then they're already shifting it's like
[16:18.880 --> 16:22.360]  they have FBI meetings to fight al-qaeda and even rural areas you go to the
[16:22.360 --> 16:26.480]  meeting it's a two-day meeting got free coffee donuts ten minutes is al-qaeda

[34:55.520 --> 35:01.480]  what he did and rediscover what America is you know that it is the opposite of
[35:01.480 --> 35:06.280]  what government is today and that if George Washington was alive today he
[35:06.280 --> 35:09.800]  would probably already be in a shooting war with the government because the
[35:09.800 --> 35:14.120]  government is illegitimate and criminal or in a different world we need to
[35:14.120 --> 35:19.360]  circumvent that as long as we can and hopefully averted but it is time for all
[35:19.360 --> 35:23.920]  the corrupt people out there who have never really had it laid out in front of
[35:23.920 --> 35:29.480]  them the the real choices to make their decision and decide who they stand with
[35:29.480 --> 35:34.480]  the spirit of 1776 and George Washington Thomas Jefferson or with David
[35:34.480 --> 35:41.680]  Rockefeller the Rothschild's the New World Order now was the time to choose now
[35:41.680 --> 35:46.920]  was the time to relearn that incredible wisdom of the true revolutionary trail
[35:46.920 --> 35:55.280]  blazers our founding fathers chief among them general George Washington so I
[35:55.280 --> 36:02.680]  want to play this clip of a breakdown by a historian in a live speech just a few
[36:02.680 --> 36:06.520]  months ago of George Washington I'm quite the history buff on the
[36:06.520 --> 36:10.440]  Revolutionary War compared to the general public it's so massive I'm really
[36:10.440 --> 36:15.480]  a novice this is very accurate about the founding fathers for any of you that
[36:15.480 --> 36:20.080]  think you don't have the metal to be part of this second revolution against
[36:20.080 --> 36:25.200]  tyranny this restoration of the Republic all you need do is decide it's your
[36:25.200 --> 36:30.400]  destiny and set out to beat the New World Order and set your mind and your
[36:30.400 --> 36:36.480]  muscle and your will against them and they will fall here it is we tend to
[36:36.480 --> 36:44.520]  see them not just the people whose figure in history books Adams Jefferson
[36:44.520 --> 36:51.240]  Thomas Paine Benjamin Rush and of course Washington we tend to see them as sort of
[36:51.240 --> 36:57.720]  figures in a costume pageant it's often the way they're portrayed and we tend
[36:57.720 --> 37:02.200]  to see them as much older than they were because we're seeing them in the
[37:02.200 --> 37:06.200]  portraits of Gilbert Stewart and others when they were truly the founding fathers
[37:06.200 --> 37:11.960]  and furthermore none of them had had any prior experience in revolutions they
[37:11.960 --> 37:17.200]  weren't experienced revolutionaries who've flown in to take part in this
[37:17.200 --> 37:23.280]  biggest of all events they were winging it they were improvising at the time of
[37:23.280 --> 37:28.360]  the revolution they were all young it was a young man's young woman's cause
[37:28.360 --> 37:33.160]  George Washington took command of the Continental Army in the summer of 1775
[37:33.160 --> 37:39.840]  at the age of 43 he was the oldest of them Adams was 40 Jefferson was all of
[37:39.840 --> 37:45.240]  1933 when he wrote the Declaration of Independence and he wasn't chosen by his
[37:45.240 --> 37:48.800]  fellow members of the Continental Congress because he was a great military
[37:48.800 --> 37:54.280]  person he was chosen because they knew him they knew the kind of man he was
[37:54.280 --> 37:59.800]  they knew his character his integrity what Washington was above all was a
[37:59.800 --> 38:09.360]  leader he was a man people would follow and as events would prove he was a man
[38:09.360 --> 38:20.720]  whom some a few would follow through hell and he would not give up he would not
[38:20.720 --> 38:26.800]  quit the army was totally demoralized they'd been defeated they were soaking
[38:26.800 --> 38:31.640]  wet they were cold they were hungry and by the time Washington started his big
[38:31.640 --> 38:36.720]  retreat his long retreat across New Jersey they were down to only a few
[38:36.720 --> 38:43.080]  thousand men that's all well Washington took stock just as the British Army was
[38:43.080 --> 38:46.960]  taking stock of what the situation was and most every officer and all the
[38:46.960 --> 38:52.640]  politicians many of whom had fled from Philadelphia by this time and most
[38:52.640 --> 38:58.320]  everybody concluded that the war was over and we had lost it it was the only
[38:58.320 --> 39:05.800]  rational conclusion one could come to it wasn't a chance so Washington did what
[39:05.800 --> 39:10.040]  you sometimes have to do when everything's lost and all hopes gone he
[39:10.040 --> 39:16.420]  attacked they went up the river Christmas night nine miles up to
[39:16.420 --> 39:23.160]  mcconkies ferry they crossed the Delaware he had the nerve the courage the
[39:23.160 --> 39:28.360]  faith in the cause to carry the war once more to the enemy and they marched
[39:28.360 --> 39:32.760]  nine miles back down the river on the eastern side and struck a Trenton the
[39:32.760 --> 39:39.120]  next morning it was a fierce house-to-house savage battle small in
[39:39.120 --> 39:45.560]  scale very very severe and it was all over in about 45 minutes and we won for
[39:45.560 --> 39:52.920]  the first time now it wasn't a great battle like Brooklyn this was a small
[39:52.920 --> 40:00.240]  engagement but its consequences were enormous beyond reckoning because of
[40:00.240 --> 40:05.720]  the psychological effect it transformed the attitude of the army and of much of
[40:05.720 --> 40:11.200]  the country toward the war and in that it was a pivotal turning point
[40:11.200 --> 40:18.280]  Washington the political general never forgotten that Congress was boss and the
[40:18.280 --> 40:23.080]  war was at last over Washington in one of the most important events in our
[40:23.080 --> 40:30.320]  entire history turned back his command to the Congress no conquering general
[40:30.320 --> 40:36.880]  had done that before when George III heard that George Washington might do
[40:36.880 --> 40:42.820]  this King George III said if he does that he will be the greatest man in the
[40:42.820 --> 40:48.440]  world so what does it tell us it tells us the rich the original decision the
[40:48.440 --> 40:54.560]  Continental Congress was the wise one they knew the man they knew his character
[40:54.560 --> 40:59.960]  and he lived up to his reputation
[41:01.760 --> 41:07.560]  now compare that to what we've turned into today we need to rediscover true
[41:07.560 --> 41:13.720]  liberty true true freedom and virtue and we need to understand that the globalist
[41:13.720 --> 41:17.880]  are not invincible with all their lies and corruption and manipulation their
[41:17.880 --> 41:21.440]  control of the left and the right we just had a giant victory
[41:21.440 --> 41:27.400]  bancai moon secretary general the UN Herman von Roompi head of the EU
[41:27.400 --> 41:30.720]  announced global government is now being established we're gonna levy
[41:30.720 --> 41:36.440]  global carbon taxes we're going to shut down industrial society all announced
[41:36.440 --> 41:42.360]  this on TV they said we will pass it and they failed because the fraud was leaked
[41:42.360 --> 41:46.920]  and we're having many other victories and in my experience every time we fight
[41:46.920 --> 41:53.300]  if we fight and fight and fight and persevere if we lose 20 times and on the
[41:53.300 --> 41:59.920]  21st time when we win it is the act of resistance that is victory when you have
[41:59.920 --> 42:05.280]  right on your side hundreds of battles were fought by the colonies and you
[42:05.280 --> 42:13.080]  could do the numbers but maybe one out of 15 were one that's a guesstimation of
[42:13.080 --> 42:18.640]  because some battles it wasn't exactly clear who won but the vast majority were
[42:18.640 --> 42:26.360]  won by the crown but it was the perseverance and it was waiting till
[42:26.360 --> 42:30.280]  the main British army was tied down with the French and when their main fleet
[42:30.280 --> 42:34.960]  had been destroyed in the Atlantic it was the fact that they bankrupt the
[42:34.960 --> 42:42.640]  coffers of King George III and Hamilton and others came to Washington but they
[42:42.640 --> 42:46.120]  don't tell you that little short pieces they said we want you to be king a large
[42:46.120 --> 42:51.640]  contingent and he said no and he left he didn't want to be president but they
[42:51.640 --> 42:56.440]  do you know the people wanted it and then the second election he got voted in
[42:56.440 --> 43:01.880]  that's what the people wanted he couldn't wait to get out of Washington and in
[43:01.880 --> 43:06.520]  his farewell address he said don't get involved as an empire don't join
[43:06.520 --> 43:10.640]  alliances with other countries they will come in and take us over they will
[43:10.640 --> 43:16.280]  bring us down because the French had tried to come in and do that during his
[43:16.280 --> 43:25.760]  first and second term and he went home to his farm and died two years later he
[43:25.760 --> 43:30.280]  was offered to be the king of America that's why Mexico is so corrupt today
[43:30.280 --> 43:35.640]  they had kings they had Austrian Hungarian Empire kings the kings of Europe
[43:35.640 --> 43:39.640]  would sit in their princelings there and Mexico's run by a ruling shadow
[43:39.640 --> 43:50.720]  oligarchy today every other country has scum running in North Korea everywhere
[43:51.400 --> 43:55.760]  China has a bunch of corrupt thugs their people are good but they didn't have
[43:55.760 --> 43:59.800]  George Washington they didn't have Thomas Jefferson the French and their
[43:59.800 --> 44:04.240]  revolution was a wicked counterfeit of what happened here and they attempted to
[44:04.240 --> 44:08.880]  take that over through Washington and he said no later and that's a whole
[44:08.880 --> 44:15.280]  another history but I think about how domesticated we've become in this
[44:15.280 --> 44:22.840]  country I think about how all over the country I see the reports I talk to
[44:22.840 --> 44:28.760]  parents I meet parents where they're scared of an orange nerf gun where the
[44:28.760 --> 44:33.720]  schools are banning tag and dodgeball and hugging or talking we're all becoming
[44:33.720 --> 44:38.200]  prisoners under a psychiatric dictatorship mothers think it's good to
[44:38.200 --> 44:41.880]  make their sons and daughters cowards and helpless to raise them up to be
[44:41.880 --> 44:48.920]  hapless weaklings like legless and armless gerbils in a cage disarmed
[44:48.920 --> 44:55.240]  defanged so the boa constrictors of big government can eat them at their leisure
[44:56.880 --> 45:04.080]  rediscover the spirit of 1776 rediscover who your ancestors are rediscover what
[45:04.080 --> 45:12.600]  freedom really is you know in my film police state to the takeover we show
[45:12.600 --> 45:16.520]  government training manuals demonizing the founding fathers in my film the
[45:16.520 --> 45:19.680]  road to tyranny we have footage of Thomas Jefferson Benjamin Franklin being
[45:19.680 --> 45:26.600]  called terrorist by FEMA brainwashing police we've released over the years
[45:26.600 --> 45:30.480]  that's been leaked to us scores of inside government training manuals
[45:30.480 --> 45:34.560]  demonizing veterans gun owners conservatives libertarians real liberals
[45:34.560 --> 45:40.080]  who are against war not the fake establishment type you are the target
[45:40.080 --> 45:43.960]  of this criminal group they know history they know their history and they know our
[45:43.960 --> 45:47.600]  history and they know what they've got to destroy they know what they've got to
[45:47.600 --> 45:52.240]  bring down they know what they've got to demonize but the way they've destroyed
[45:52.240 --> 45:56.360]  the image of George Washington is showing you know one of the final
[45:56.360 --> 46:02.880]  portraits of him an old man big lips big mouth big ivory painful teeth that's
[46:02.880 --> 46:09.320]  he really had ivory teeth not wooden all the battle wounds he had going back
[46:09.320 --> 46:13.720]  when he was the militia and fighting the French they show that image an old man
[46:13.720 --> 46:18.600]  and they teach you in school that he had teeth that hurt and that he got bled
[46:18.600 --> 46:24.240]  to death and that's all you're taught it's just some boring stuffy guy they
[46:24.240 --> 46:28.240]  don't want you to know what founded this country or they want to demonize the
[46:28.240 --> 46:32.400]  founders and talk about the problems and the bad things they did which were
[46:32.400 --> 46:36.160]  there but compared to their contemporaries around the world these
[46:36.160 --> 46:40.640]  were the highest expression of the Renaissance the highest expression of
[46:40.640 --> 46:45.120]  virtue the highest expression of humanity the highest expression of the
[46:45.120 --> 46:50.640]  Greek philosophers I studied it all and it's not hype when you talk about our
[46:50.640 --> 46:55.920]  founding fathers and how great they were the world marveled the king of England
[46:55.920 --> 47:04.240]  said he is the greatest man in the world George Washington
[47:05.160 --> 47:14.400]  turning down kingship turning down the British payoff the king of England called
[47:14.400 --> 47:25.640]  in several US ambassadors one of them Adams and said you're gonna need a king
[47:25.640 --> 47:32.080]  even a you know even if you win this thing in the future they know the the
[47:32.080 --> 47:36.600]  royalty really believe they said what about democracy 51% will vote to rob
[47:36.600 --> 47:41.640]  the other 49 the howl of the mob they said no we have a republic where
[47:41.640 --> 47:45.600]  everyone's rights are protected and that's why they've now replaced the
[47:45.600 --> 47:57.200]  republic with the democracy if 51% say kill the other 49 it happens and I want
[47:57.200 --> 48:02.040]  to read to you two different quotes attributed confirmed to George Washington
[48:02.040 --> 48:07.200]  in letters and speeches different variants of this unhappy it is this is
[48:07.200 --> 48:13.680]  1775 after leisington and concord the massacres unhappy it is though to
[48:13.680 --> 48:18.960]  reflect that a brother's sword has been sheath and a brother's breast and that
[48:18.960 --> 48:23.000]  the once happy and peaceful planes of America are either to be drenched with
[48:23.000 --> 48:28.800]  blood or inhabited by slaves sad alternative but can a virtuous man
[48:28.800 --> 48:33.680]  hesitate in his choice George Washington after the battles of leisington and
[48:33.680 --> 48:38.080]  concord washington also repeatedly made the similar statement but shorter that
[48:38.080 --> 48:41.720]  it is better for our land to be drenched in blood than for us to become
[48:41.720 --> 48:46.800]  slaves of our own government he said that 1776 once he took command of the
[48:46.800 --> 48:53.760]  continental army and so FEMA is right to hate George Washington because it is an
[48:53.760 --> 49:00.640]  alien illegitimate criminal corporate receivership arm taking our country by
[49:00.640 --> 49:09.280]  fraud into bankruptcy and perfecting a neo feudalistic form of serfdom of
[49:09.280 --> 49:13.680]  shutting off people's resources through artificial scarcity and monopoly
[49:13.680 --> 49:18.400]  capitalism to create an ultra super elite and shut down all their competition
[49:18.400 --> 49:23.320]  and have one child policies and bring in a form of tyranny never dreamed of
[49:23.320 --> 49:32.560]  over man in all the government textbooks in all the reports in all their own
[49:32.560 --> 49:41.680]  statements this is a group of vicious wicked greedy control freaks versus
[49:41.680 --> 49:46.320]  free humanity that just wants to live and be comfortable and be free and be
[49:46.320 --> 49:50.520]  left alone well you're not gonna be left alone George Washington wanted to be
[49:50.520 --> 49:55.280]  left alone but government grew and grew and grew and the bureaucrats were rude
[49:55.280 --> 49:59.200]  and they violated the laws and they were corrupt and they did whatever they
[49:59.200 --> 50:06.000]  wanted and when police shot innocent unarmed citizens men back then got
[50:06.000 --> 50:12.720]  angry and they went to war and these were men who owned a lot of property they
[50:12.720 --> 50:18.400]  were members of the establishment but they understood tyranny there's another
[50:18.400 --> 50:21.960]  big reason men haven't risen up quicker and that is because and it's now been
[50:21.960 --> 50:27.320]  on Fox News and now in Japan and on oh they want to put lithium in your water
[50:27.320 --> 50:31.240]  an anti-psycho they want to put Prozac they're testing it oh they want to put

[50:42.080 --> 50:47.040]  becoming sterile it's so great and the economist how the population problem is
[50:47.040 --> 50:54.600]  solving itself and you open it up it says oh the dividends of the demographic

[53:57.040 --> 54:06.800]  that's 800-34 no tax the core message is unity George Washington's the great
[54:06.800 --> 54:13.520]  unifier he believes that the answer to how to have personal freedom and liberty
[54:13.520 --> 54:19.040]  is through a strong united government don't love any country too much don't
[54:19.040 --> 54:23.400]  hate any country too much either one will lead you to act against your own
[54:23.400 --> 54:29.960]  interests the goal is to establish an independent America a strong united
[54:29.960 --> 54:36.560]  America in 1797 George Washington handed over the presidency and returned to his
[54:36.560 --> 54:42.000]  beloved Mount Vernon for two years he enjoyed life receiving a steady stream
[54:42.000 --> 54:47.080]  of visitors and tending his plantation then early one winter morning he rode
[54:47.080 --> 54:51.120]  out to inspect his estate when he returned he complained of a small
[54:51.120 --> 54:58.680]  throat a fever developed and two days later on the 14th of December 1799 he
[54:58.680 --> 55:03.800]  died he was 67 years old
[55:06.840 --> 55:15.680]  okay folks the issue here is we're told that we have to constantly support
[55:15.680 --> 55:19.640]  other governments get involved in wars but that's the opposite of what George
[55:19.640 --> 55:25.840]  Washington said but again he's not a real American maybe he's al-Qaeda like
[55:25.840 --> 55:31.640]  FEMA teaches how brainwashing you police and military George Washington's now
[55:31.640 --> 55:41.240]  bad and Maury strong in the UN they're good well we've got to give our rights
[55:41.240 --> 55:45.880]  up because the underwear bomber but you look at the evidence there and that's
[55:45.880 --> 55:54.640]  clearly a staged event you know in the first hour of the show today well first
[55:54.640 --> 55:59.040]  off I'm going to be spending more time at least once a week focusing on a
[55:59.040 --> 56:03.880]  founding father we'll go back over key founding fathers little tidbits history
[56:03.880 --> 56:07.480]  more of their quotes I've always done that but not enough we're going to get
[56:07.480 --> 56:12.160]  into what America is so people know the difference between the tyranny they
[56:12.160 --> 56:16.120]  don't know what tyranny is because they never were given a choice they think
[56:16.120 --> 56:22.320]  checkpoints and secret arrest is freedom they don't know what real freedom was
[56:22.320 --> 56:27.800]  they don't know what our real history is people don't have basic logic they
[56:27.800 --> 56:31.120]  don't understand everything's not the way it's presented like who was good the
[56:31.120 --> 56:36.800]  north of the south and the civil war neither side it was manipulated by
[56:36.800 --> 56:40.760]  British intelligence on both sides and that's even mainline history but not
[56:40.760 --> 56:46.240]  taught and not on mainline television see once people have a real view of
[56:46.240 --> 56:51.040]  history it's all crystal once you learn this information you can go out for
[56:51.040 --> 56:58.360]  yourself and know more than I do but long live George Washington what does

[58:12.560 --> 58:16.240]  knowing we've killed over 50 million babies in this country is what matters
[58:16.240 --> 58:21.000]  knowing that if we stand up we can beat these people that's what matters tomorrow

[59:02.880 --> 59:07.040]  Americans at home I've truly never seen influence on our president in
[59:07.040 --> 59:12.160]  Congress and they really are calling the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of
[59:12.160 --> 59:17.160]  us as American citizens to pay attention fall of the Republic identifies the
[59:17.160 --> 59:21.960]  enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel hell bent on destroying
[59:21.960 --> 59:25.960]  sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government Tim Geithner
[59:25.960 --> 59:30.120]  Bernanke the arsonists they're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying
[59:30.120 --> 59:34.120]  who do we make the checkout to today seems like nobody does care and right

[1:00:17.480 --> 1:00:28.080]  Alex Jones Godfrey Bloom joining us coming up in the next segment member of
[1:00:28.080 --> 1:00:33.640]  the European Parliament for Yorkshire the United Kingdom Independence Party the
[1:00:33.640 --> 1:00:37.400]  last hour I'm gonna break down inner pole getting diplomatic immunity in the
[1:00:37.400 --> 1:00:41.960]  US and I'm gonna recap the latest developments with the vaunted shoe
[1:00:41.960 --> 1:00:49.080]  bomber slash underwear bomber slash syringe bomber and how completely staged
[1:00:49.080 --> 1:00:53.120]  that is the good news is we exposed the fact that bush was issuing terror
[1:00:53.120 --> 1:00:57.160]  alerts for political purposes and now it's been declassified and Governor
[1:00:57.160 --> 1:01:01.120]  Ridge wrote a book admitting it they had a homeland security that's pretty
[1:01:01.120 --> 1:01:06.800]  authoritative and we're gonna expose Obama and the Brits and the Germans and
[1:01:06.800 --> 1:01:10.640]  others for using this as a way to enslave their people and we exposed the
[1:01:10.640 --> 1:01:16.000]  flu shots as a fraud you know they tried to order forced inoculations in New
[1:01:16.000 --> 1:01:24.080]  York and Boston in Massachusetts that failed and they'll undoubtedly come back
[1:01:24.080 --> 1:01:27.640]  and try again you know I love the Cointel Pro that oh Alex said we'd have
[1:01:27.640 --> 1:01:32.960]  martial law Alex said we'd have forced inoculations Alex said we'd have this
[1:01:32.960 --> 1:01:36.640]  and that well we would have had all that if you wouldn't have stood up and
[1:01:36.640 --> 1:01:42.080]  taken action see the establishment wants to tell you there is no New World Order
[1:01:42.080 --> 1:01:46.640]  there is no threat there is no forced inoculation even as the internal
[1:01:46.640 --> 1:01:50.360]  documents went out from FEMA getting people ready for it then multiple
[1:01:50.360 --> 1:01:55.240]  states tried it the people stood up and said no they had to back off we had a
[1:01:55.240 --> 1:02:00.080]  major victory so Cointel Pro was exposed so then they flipped their operation
[1:02:00.080 --> 1:02:06.920]  saying there was never a plan for forced inoculations that's a lie see first
[1:02:06.920 --> 1:02:10.600]  there is no plan then they admit their plan and they come back and say oh there
[1:02:10.600 --> 1:02:17.920]  was no plan we're having victories and most Americans the news is reported have
[1:02:17.920 --> 1:02:20.960]  say I don't want to go through your body scanner I don't want my naked body
[1:02:20.960 --> 1:02:26.600]  recorded and so now they're saying oh look terrorist hit us we've got to put
[1:02:26.600 --> 1:02:32.120]  everybody in a watch list and we've got to put everybody through the scanner if
[1:02:32.120 --> 1:02:38.040]  you don't do it you don't fly don't worry only foreigners coming to America at
[1:02:38.040 --> 1:02:41.920]  the thumbprint biometrically meanwhile every other country we fly to we now
[1:02:41.920 --> 1:02:46.760]  have to do it it's all under UN treaty but they tell foreigners oh don't worry
[1:02:46.760 --> 1:02:51.960]  only foreigners coming to our countries like England and Germany only they have
[1:02:51.960 --> 1:02:56.080]  the thumbprint but then when the Germans or the Brits they go anywhere they've
[1:02:56.080 --> 1:02:59.920]  got a thumbprint because it's already internationalized and this is all
[1:02:59.920 --> 1:03:08.600]  rolled out psychologically to sell the public on going along with it now our
[1:03:08.600 --> 1:03:12.200]  guest is coming up then I'm going to get to Wayne Mike Mike Chris Mark and

[1:08:04.480 --> 1:08:09.920]  cities well in the coming of the very early skiing season and snow and ice
[1:08:09.920 --> 1:08:13.320]  that's come there what of course is indicative of the fact that as
[1:08:13.320 --> 1:08:17.520]  independent science has now confirmed that the globe is actually cooling and
[1:08:17.520 --> 1:08:24.680]  has been cooling since 2002 broadly flat since 1998 so we're all talking about
[1:08:24.680 --> 1:08:28.640]  something here which isn't happening I've heard time and time again members
[1:08:28.640 --> 1:08:33.560]  here talk of CO2 as a pollutant a pollutant is a life-giving natural gas it
[1:08:33.560 --> 1:08:36.800]  gives me the impression that some of our members haven't had the benefit of a
[1:08:36.800 --> 1:08:42.920]  formal education isn't this really just about the state being able to get its
[1:08:42.920 --> 1:08:48.760]  hand in ordinary people's trouser pocket to steal get more tax from them isn't
[1:08:48.760 --> 1:08:54.040]  this all about political control isn't all this about politics and big
[1:08:54.040 --> 1:09:00.360]  business the whole thing's a sham this bogus hypothesis this ridiculous
[1:09:00.360 --> 1:09:05.480]  nonsense that man-made CO2 is causing global warming enough please before we
[1:09:05.480 --> 1:09:14.400]  damage irrevocably the global economy okay well that's God tree bloom he's an
[1:09:14.400 --> 1:09:20.480]  economist military veteran he is on the economic monetary affairs committee for
[1:09:20.480 --> 1:09:25.880]  the European Union Parliament and their environment committee and we have him
[1:09:25.880 --> 1:09:31.280]  for the rest of the hour very honored to have him with us on this Monday the 28th
[1:09:31.280 --> 1:09:38.040]  day of December 2009 to give us a European Union view of how this
[1:09:38.040 --> 1:09:44.000]  unelected bureaucracy just continues to take over more and more of our sovereignty
[1:09:44.000 --> 1:09:49.000]  and how they openly admit this is a tax to control our lives and the words of
[1:09:49.000 --> 1:09:54.680]  Maury strong at the UN to destroy our industrial society so to get a view on
[1:09:54.680 --> 1:09:59.120]  what just happened in Copenhagen and so much more and on what's happening with
[1:09:59.120 --> 1:10:04.600]  the dollar the pound the euro what's happening with gold to get a lot of
[1:10:04.600 --> 1:10:09.640]  different perspectives we have Godfrey bloom MEP a member of European
[1:10:09.640 --> 1:10:14.800]  Parliament his website is Godfrey bloom MEP dot co.uk thank you for joining us
[1:10:14.800 --> 1:10:19.480]  sir great pleasure Alex good to have you here well I just played a brief clip of
[1:10:19.480 --> 1:10:26.120]  you in the EU standing up to these people what is the state of the European
[1:10:26.120 --> 1:10:31.280]  Union right now are they angry that their full power grab failed Gordon Brown is
[1:10:31.280 --> 1:10:35.880]  saying he doesn't care he is writing the agreement that the West will pledge
[1:10:35.880 --> 1:10:42.080]  money to the IMF and World Bank and UN regardless to these private bankers I
[1:10:42.080 --> 1:10:48.000]  mean this what when is this swindle and well I'm beginning to wonder actually
[1:10:48.000 --> 1:10:52.720]  it's extraordinary that I find that I used to think that the United
[1:10:52.720 --> 1:10:57.160]  Kingdom and to an extent Europe used to follow the United States in a lot of
[1:10:57.160 --> 1:11:02.160]  these matters and I'm rather a rather fancy now that we are actually slightly
[1:11:02.160 --> 1:11:05.640]  ahead of you and I'm watching America make some of the same mistakes that we've
[1:11:05.640 --> 1:11:12.840]  been making since 1945 we've actually handed over our country the United
[1:11:12.840 --> 1:11:17.200]  Kingdom one of the oldest democracies in the world has now handed its entire
[1:11:17.200 --> 1:11:23.200]  government over to an unelected bureaucracy in Brussels without the will
[1:11:23.200 --> 1:11:26.480]  of the British people without any form of referendum and without any
[1:11:26.480 --> 1:11:31.280]  understanding of what we've been doing and it's something that's been a
[1:11:31.280 --> 1:11:35.560]  conspiracy between all the major parties in the United Kingdom and all
[1:11:35.560 --> 1:11:40.800]  the political elements in the European Union quite quite disgraceful quite
[1:11:40.800 --> 1:11:46.960]  horrifying and unbelievable absolutely just like US politics I've studied
[1:11:46.960 --> 1:11:52.120]  somewhat the British system and it's the same thing special globalist interest
[1:11:52.120 --> 1:11:57.080]  come in buy off the two or three or four top parties the parties may fight with
[1:11:57.080 --> 1:12:01.800]  each other over power but not over carrying out their masters agenda can
[1:12:01.800 --> 1:12:06.720]  you break down how England has been absorbed and never been allowed to
[1:12:06.720 --> 1:12:12.080]  have a vote into the European Union so Americans and Canadians and Mexicans on
[1:12:12.080 --> 1:12:16.840]  the North American continent can draw parallels to how by stealth and that's
[1:12:16.840 --> 1:12:21.280]  in the SPP North American Union documents we're having North American
[1:12:21.280 --> 1:12:26.560]  integration and we're not allowed to have a vote on it either it's quite it's
[1:12:26.560 --> 1:12:32.400]  quite extraordinary in 1975 we had a referendum and we were told it was
[1:12:32.400 --> 1:12:35.640]  called something called the common market we were told it was a free trade
[1:12:35.640 --> 1:12:40.880]  zone and of course being a free economist myself and a global free trader
[1:12:40.880 --> 1:12:46.200]  and I'm a relatively young man at the time in 1975 I voted for it as a lot of
[1:12:46.200 --> 1:12:50.520]  people did on the basis that we were told quite categorically it wouldn't
[1:12:50.520 --> 1:12:55.160]  affect our sovereignty as a nation it was a free trade area with bring down
[1:12:55.160 --> 1:12:59.560]  trade barriers and bureaucracy and we could all trade with each other and be
[1:12:59.560 --> 1:13:03.640]  friends and we all thought that was a good idea there was no question of
[1:13:03.640 --> 1:13:08.760]  there being political union of any sort this wasn't on the agenda and we've seen
[1:13:08.760 --> 1:13:14.480]  a sort of salami slicing going on now since 1975 with one treaty after the
[1:13:14.480 --> 1:13:22.440]  other which has taken us towards what we now have which is a a soviet model we
[1:13:22.440 --> 1:13:26.040]  have a soviet model some people try and pretend it's the United States model but
[1:13:26.040 --> 1:13:31.400]  it isn't it's a soviet model where our laws are actually made by an unelected
[1:13:31.400 --> 1:13:36.200]  bureaucracy and I had some of your congressmen over to Brussels who were
[1:13:36.200 --> 1:13:39.880]  visiting and I had the pleasure of meeting them a little while ago just a
[1:13:39.880 --> 1:13:45.040]  few weeks ago and they were absolutely astounded and horrified but the European
[1:13:45.040 --> 1:13:50.640]  parliament doesn't actually make the law it's an amending chamber and so we now
[1:13:50.640 --> 1:13:56.880]  have 75 percent of our laws in England made by an unelected international or
[1:13:56.880 --> 1:14:01.840]  European bureaucracy with actually no recourse to the British voters there's
[1:14:01.840 --> 1:14:06.800]  no cost-benefit analysis there's no debate that you would expect to have in
[1:14:06.800 --> 1:14:11.600]  our Westminster chamber and people feel totally powerless and what's actually
[1:14:11.600 --> 1:14:16.160]  happening now is that fewer and fewer people are actually voting at elections
[1:14:16.160 --> 1:14:19.560]  because they know it doesn't do any good because their laws are no longer
[1:14:19.560 --> 1:14:24.640]  made in London which is what the bureaucrats love they love people
[1:14:24.640 --> 1:14:29.240]  capitulating going into a sense of apathy but I have to tell you your party the
[1:14:29.240 --> 1:14:34.480]  UK IP the UK independence party is certainly rising and a lot of people
[1:14:34.480 --> 1:14:39.320]  are losing that apathy and finding out that this illegitimate system can be
[1:14:39.320 --> 1:14:43.360]  resisted now expanding on that with European Union member of Parliament
[1:14:43.360 --> 1:14:50.080]  Godfrey bloom for those that don't know can you explain how this unelected
[1:14:50.080 --> 1:14:55.400]  bureaucracy circumvented or circumnavigated the checks and balances how
[1:14:55.400 --> 1:14:58.800]  they do this by stealth because I've studied it but I'm not as big an expert
[1:14:58.800 --> 1:15:01.800]  obviously as you are being in the European Parliament what for five years
[1:15:01.800 --> 1:15:06.640]  because when studying your system it's very similar and has the very same
[1:15:06.640 --> 1:15:12.520]  people involved that are running our North American Union by stealth and we're
[1:15:12.520 --> 1:15:17.440]  just a few decades behind you but but but the process of integration is now
[1:15:17.440 --> 1:15:22.920]  accelerated here as it is there and so by understanding this model we can then
[1:15:22.920 --> 1:15:27.360]  understand how to throw it off not just in Europe and England but here in North
[1:15:27.360 --> 1:15:34.520]  America as well it's extremely difficult actually because you like us have a
[1:15:34.520 --> 1:15:38.640]  two-party system we have the Conservatives of Labor you have Republicans
[1:15:38.640 --> 1:15:43.880]  and Democrats it's extremely difficult if the two parties that you have and
[1:15:43.880 --> 1:15:47.960]  that's a sort of democracy that's grown up over the years you either vote for
[1:15:47.960 --> 1:15:52.240]  the Republicans or Democrats over there we have a vote for the Conservative Party
[1:15:52.240 --> 1:15:57.040]  or the Labor Party but what we actually have is the two parties actually agree
[1:15:57.040 --> 1:16:01.920]  on the main fundamentals of handing over control to an international political
[1:16:01.920 --> 1:16:06.800]  elite and what we've actually built up over the years is a political elite
[1:16:06.800 --> 1:16:12.040]  which is totally and utterly divorced from the will of ordinary people and so
[1:16:12.040 --> 1:16:17.360]  when you go into we go into the pub you go into bars or we go into the cricket
[1:16:17.360 --> 1:16:21.280]  club you go into the baseball club or whatever you find that ordinary people
[1:16:21.280 --> 1:16:25.880]  don't want any of this but they've been sidelined by professional politicians
[1:16:25.880 --> 1:16:30.960]  whereas maybe 200 years ago certainly in Europe there was an aristocratic class
[1:16:30.960 --> 1:16:36.880]  who ran Europe now with a political class and of course they have complete
[1:16:36.880 --> 1:16:42.360]  control over public service broadcasting over here the BBC is funded and
[1:16:42.360 --> 1:16:47.880]  paid for by the same people and they promulgate the same view that we should
[1:16:47.880 --> 1:16:53.960]  be internationally governed and so it leaves democracy completely behind and
[1:16:53.960 --> 1:16:59.920]  let's be clear you have a bureaucracy that sets the policies and then all the
[1:16:59.920 --> 1:17:05.160]  elected parliament that's represented by the different nations all you can do is
[1:17:05.160 --> 1:17:13.320]  basically amend or debate smaller smaller sections so so literally the
[1:17:13.320 --> 1:17:18.320]  once sovereign nations of Europe and England have been turned into vestigial
[1:17:18.320 --> 1:17:24.160]  ceremonial offices this is quite true and of course it's totally against our
[1:17:24.160 --> 1:17:28.200]  Constitution what a lot of Americans might visit America quite a lot and I
[1:17:28.200 --> 1:17:32.800]  love to do so they're not fully they don't fully understand that we do
[1:17:32.800 --> 1:17:38.480]  actually have a constitution in Britain we did we do have something called the
[1:17:38.480 --> 1:17:44.760]  Bill of Rights which was formulated in 1688 so it's several hundred years old
[1:17:44.760 --> 1:17:49.240]  they have the parliament act to don't you know even before that Magna Carta we do
[1:17:49.240 --> 1:17:53.520]  and if you go back to 1215 of course you go quite rightly I'll expect Magna
[1:17:53.520 --> 1:17:59.560]  Carta so we've had a thousand years nearly of developing a parliamentary
[1:17:59.560 --> 1:18:03.960]  constitutional democracy under a constitutional monarchy that by the way
[1:18:03.960 --> 1:18:09.600]  for those that don't know was bought with a lot of blood and a lot of heroics
[1:18:09.600 --> 1:18:13.760]  that was in the model for our system here in the United States well that's
[1:18:13.760 --> 1:18:19.680]  quite right we fought to preserve a constitutional democratic monarchy in
[1:18:19.680 --> 1:18:25.160]  many many wars and and of course in the last century alongside the United States
[1:18:25.160 --> 1:18:29.920]  as our great ally and I'm a great believer in the transatlantic alliance
[1:18:29.920 --> 1:18:35.440]  between our two our two nations because we basically we think alike and we
[1:18:35.440 --> 1:18:40.120]  believe in the same things but what the problem with us is that we've discarded
[1:18:40.120 --> 1:18:46.320]  our Constitution and I noticed almost on a you know on a yearly basis the same
[1:18:46.320 --> 1:18:51.000]  thing is happening to America you've discarded your Constitution and we
[1:18:51.000 --> 1:18:55.400]  regard a certainly thinking people over here regard the American Constitution
[1:18:55.400 --> 1:19:00.600]  as one of the greatest documents ever written it's amazing they're getting
[1:19:00.600 --> 1:19:05.880]  rid of due process secret arrest is being implemented warrantless spying all the
[1:19:05.880 --> 1:19:10.400]  same systems we see in Europe England and are being implemented in the US the
[1:19:10.400 --> 1:19:14.360]  bureaucracies even give the programs the same names this is all being
[1:19:14.360 --> 1:19:19.760]  internationally organized and five members of our Supreme Court have said
[1:19:19.760 --> 1:19:24.880]  in the last two years that they will follow UN courts above our courts when
[1:19:24.880 --> 1:19:31.160]  this is a despotism we have in Brussels a despotism we have in Manhattan now
[1:19:31.160 --> 1:19:37.280]  Obama has signed an executive order saying Interpol has diplomatic community
[1:19:37.280 --> 1:19:42.320]  in the US above even our own FBI I want to talk about what it's like living

[1:22:02.280 --> 1:22:06.360]  understand the risks of deficit spending therefore with catastrophic events it
[1:22:06.360 --> 1:22:10.000]  comes as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount
[1:22:10.000 --> 1:22:13.680]  of cash depositors can remove from their accounts a fractional reserve system
[1:22:13.680 --> 1:22:17.400]  means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate
[1:22:17.400 --> 1:22:21.040]  withdrawal deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government
[1:22:21.040 --> 1:22:25.360]  is forced to ensure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy a
[1:22:25.360 --> 1:22:28.920]  current effort is underway by the Fed along with other central banks to
[1:22:28.920 --> 1:22:32.480]  increase liquidity for depositors however an increase in money supply
[1:22:32.480 --> 1:22:36.720]  without equal expansion and productivity can cause inflation in order to achieve

[1:24:31.320 --> 1:24:35.560]  power tries to abuse people more and more countries are voting to not expand
[1:24:35.560 --> 1:24:40.640]  their power though they just keep coming back with referendums till they do
[1:24:40.640 --> 1:24:44.600]  it looks like Greece and other countries may go bankrupt under the EU
[1:24:44.600 --> 1:24:48.960]  I mean there's more and more talk of the EU falling apart a is that accurate b
[1:24:48.960 --> 1:24:53.640]  should we hope for that I mean how do we combat these people?
[1:24:53.640 --> 1:24:57.520]  well we've had a we've got some of the problems we have is in the differences
[1:24:57.520 --> 1:25:02.360]  of law that we have in the United States and the United Kingdom we have three
[1:25:02.360 --> 1:25:07.760]  main pillars of our legal system that is the presumption of innocence trial by
[1:25:07.760 --> 1:25:11.840]  jury and the concept of habeas corpus i.e. the state can't lock somebody up
[1:25:11.840 --> 1:25:19.640]  without giving them a proper trial and and a judicial system now the we've
[1:25:19.640 --> 1:25:24.200]  taken over or the European Union has taken over something called the
[1:25:24.200 --> 1:25:30.080]  Napoleonic Code which doesn't embody any of these things and our Supreme Court
[1:25:30.080 --> 1:25:35.120]  which was in fact the House of Lords that was our final that was our final
[1:25:35.120 --> 1:25:41.520]  Court of Appeal legally has been taken over by the European Court of Justice
[1:25:41.520 --> 1:25:46.440]  which outranks that now under a completely different system of law
[1:25:46.440 --> 1:25:51.440]  they have a prescriptive system of law and where these two things are
[1:25:51.440 --> 1:25:55.080]  extremely different and this is something that your listeners need to
[1:25:55.080 --> 1:26:00.480]  understand because this is where it all begins the system that we have in the
[1:26:00.480 --> 1:26:06.800]  United Kingdom and largely the same in the United States of America is that
[1:26:06.800 --> 1:26:13.320]  the legal system tells you that which you may not do so there are a book of
[1:26:13.320 --> 1:26:18.520]  rules of things that you cannot do which we would all accept is fundamentally
[1:26:18.520 --> 1:26:22.680]  fair now the system of government that's coming to Europe and I think is
[1:26:22.680 --> 1:26:27.240]  coming into the United States is a system which tells you that which you can
[1:26:27.240 --> 1:26:32.560]  do a prescriptive legal system which is extremely dangerous and extremely
[1:26:32.560 --> 1:26:37.640]  sinister we do not want the government of the day to tell us what we can do we
[1:26:37.640 --> 1:26:42.880]  just want a small book of rules and if I may just use a little analogy which I
[1:26:42.880 --> 1:26:47.160]  often use here which will help your listeners understand the point that I'm
[1:26:47.160 --> 1:26:52.360]  making is that those of you with those of your listeners with children teenage
[1:26:52.360 --> 1:26:57.560]  children probably say as we do in England look you there are half a dozen
[1:26:57.560 --> 1:27:02.040]  things you can't do in your room you know you you can't smoke you can't play
[1:27:02.040 --> 1:27:06.640]  loud music no members opposite sex late at night whatever probably half a dozen
[1:27:06.640 --> 1:27:12.480]  fairly sensible rules but apart from that the room belongs to you know the
[1:27:12.480 --> 1:27:16.560]  teenager and it's their space and I think that's the way we've always wanted to
[1:27:16.560 --> 1:27:22.120]  work in our two countries if you start telling them kids what they can do you
[1:27:22.120 --> 1:27:28.440]  have a completely legalistic and prescriptive system which nobody wants
[1:27:28.440 --> 1:27:33.520]  and of course that means you actually lose that concept of freedom under the
[1:27:33.520 --> 1:27:38.440]  law which we all value so highly and you rightly said earlier Alex so many so
[1:27:38.440 --> 1:27:45.320]  many young men have died for over the last hundred years it's amazing but
[1:27:45.320 --> 1:27:53.480]  expanding on this was it not a grievous blow was it a mortal blow to have their
[1:27:53.480 --> 1:28:01.320]  Copenhagen treaty blow up in their face or as Gordon Brown saying hey we've
[1:28:01.320 --> 1:28:05.200]  always been an unelected bureaucracy we'll just go ahead and write up the
[1:28:05.200 --> 1:28:08.960]  agreement and we'll start monitoring countries whether they like it or not
[1:28:08.960 --> 1:28:14.520]  and we'll start taxing the England the European Union and the US and we'll
[1:28:14.520 --> 1:28:19.160]  take that money and give it to these private banks to go out and buy off
[1:28:19.160 --> 1:28:23.360]  countries to go ahead and go along with it I mean they show what tyrants they
[1:28:23.360 --> 1:28:28.600]  are in that even though the Copenhagen thing fell apart they're still going
[1:28:28.600 --> 1:28:35.240]  ahead with it nothing there's nothing that the modern political class seems to
[1:28:35.240 --> 1:28:40.400]  take notice of of ordinary voters they they don't seem to care about what
[1:28:40.400 --> 1:28:44.840]  ordinary people think now for example my party the United Kingdom independence
[1:28:44.840 --> 1:28:50.240]  party at the last European election on June the 4th came second over the whole
[1:28:50.240 --> 1:28:54.800]  country in the United Kingdom and you know very well over there how difficult
[1:28:54.800 --> 1:28:59.600]  it is to start a new political party it's almost impossible in the two party
[1:28:59.600 --> 1:29:03.760]  system in the United Kingdom and the United States but it gives you the
[1:29:03.760 --> 1:29:07.960]  depth of feeling there is amongst ordinary people but still they ignore us
[1:29:07.960 --> 1:29:12.200]  and the of course you know that the French voted against in their
[1:29:12.200 --> 1:29:17.960]  referendum only only two years ago the French voted no the Dutch voted no they
[1:29:17.960 --> 1:29:21.760]  won't give the British a referendum on the new Lisbon treaty which is the final
[1:29:21.760 --> 1:29:27.480]  treaty which is a self-amending treaty so the all this the democracy has been
[1:29:27.480 --> 1:29:33.160]  completely removed there is absolutely no democratic dimension now sir we got a
[1:29:33.160 --> 1:29:38.560]  break system of government long segment coming up continue along that thought
[1:29:38.560 --> 1:29:43.120]  line and how we beat these people on the other side I mean obviously we warn
[1:29:43.120 --> 1:29:48.120]  more people about the undemocratic nature of these people but what else can we do
[1:29:48.120 --> 1:29:57.280]  we're on the march the empires on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[1:29:57.400 --> 1:30:01.320]  this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a
[1:30:01.320 --> 1:30:05.680]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double
[1:30:05.680 --> 1:30:09.840]  or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control
[1:30:09.840 --> 1:30:13.880]  how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total
[1:30:13.880 --> 1:30:17.760]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[1:30:17.760 --> 1:30:22.040]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[1:30:22.040 --> 1:30:26.160]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[1:30:26.160 --> 1:30:30.480]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[1:30:30.480 --> 1:30:34.200]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages number
[1:30:34.200 --> 1:30:38.400]  five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of
[1:30:38.400 --> 1:30:41.760]  mind folks I really believe in the solar power generators offered by solution

[1:33:14.520 --> 1:33:18.920]  communist called a communist communist by the american communist league and
[1:33:18.920 --> 1:33:23.480]  others who call for putting americans in re-education camps
[1:33:23.480 --> 1:33:26.760]  who dedicated his book rules for radicals to lucifer
[1:33:26.760 --> 1:33:30.920]  you can't make this stuff up i mean truth is so much stranger than fiction
[1:33:30.920 --> 1:33:34.440]  under national security they declared hillary's
[1:33:34.440 --> 1:33:42.360]  thesis only the cover page was public they declared
[1:33:42.360 --> 1:33:47.400]  national security on it they've done the same thing with obamas but now
[1:33:47.400 --> 1:33:54.520]  Kurt Nemo webmaster for info wars.com just sent me this and they've reportedly
[1:33:54.520 --> 1:33:57.880]  gotten more of the thesis i was just giving this during the break let's
[1:33:57.880 --> 1:34:01.880]  check and see how much of it's there because i mean part of it's always been
[1:34:01.880 --> 1:34:05.000]  public dude just walked in and said the thesis was just released
[1:34:05.000 --> 1:34:08.520]  let's check and see if this is the whole thing i mean we know the cover sheet
[1:34:08.520 --> 1:34:12.520]  praises there is only the fight an analysis of the
[1:34:12.520 --> 1:34:19.400]  Alinsky model a thesis
[1:34:20.920 --> 1:34:24.760]  for the scholarship requirement for a bachelor of arts degree under the
[1:34:24.760 --> 1:34:28.760]  special honors program Woolsey college
[1:34:28.760 --> 1:34:32.600]  Wesley massachusetts hillary rottem clinton political science
[1:34:32.600 --> 1:34:37.320]  may 2nd 1969 she probably wanted to get the paper in on may 1st was a bit late
[1:34:37.320 --> 1:34:41.640]  though okay communist holiday these people make me sick
[1:34:41.640 --> 1:34:46.200]  but why do you see such big banks big money for socialism and communism
[1:34:46.200 --> 1:34:48.840]  because they can pool the middle classes money
[1:34:48.840 --> 1:34:54.120]  run our lives the monopoly capitalist can shut down their competition
[1:34:54.120 --> 1:34:56.760]  and then they can have a gaggle of armed thug
[1:34:56.760 --> 1:35:01.800]  communists running around enforcing it for him going to economist military
[1:35:01.800 --> 1:35:06.280]  veteran he's on the economy and monetary affairs committee of the european
[1:35:06.280 --> 1:35:10.120]  union parliament and the environmental committee as
[1:35:10.120 --> 1:35:14.840]  well godfrey bloom is our guest sir dealing with the mindset you've been
[1:35:14.840 --> 1:35:18.280]  in the parliament what five years i have indeed
[1:35:18.280 --> 1:35:22.120]  and so you're you're around these globalists you're around these
[1:35:22.120 --> 1:35:25.400]  most of them lap dogs most of them from eastern europe
[1:35:25.400 --> 1:35:28.760]  who openly love tyranny i'm not bashing eastern europeans but
[1:35:28.760 --> 1:35:34.200]  most these guys are former i guess aparatics is the word or commasars
[1:35:34.200 --> 1:35:37.800]  i've seen the list many of them were hardcore thugs
[1:35:37.800 --> 1:35:40.920]  for kruschev and people i mean you can't make this stuff up
[1:35:40.920 --> 1:35:45.640]  and so all of that's going on what is their mindset what makes them tick
[1:35:45.640 --> 1:35:51.320]  and and uh how big a blow was this what happened at kopenhagen and
[1:35:51.320 --> 1:35:55.560]  what is the environmental movement really to these people because my research
[1:35:55.560 --> 1:35:59.160]  shows they're not useful idiots they know it's a cold-blooded
[1:35:59.160 --> 1:36:03.800]  resource grab they know it's a scam i mean we've got local commasars here in
[1:36:03.800 --> 1:36:06.520]  austin i've talked to over dinner and they say
[1:36:06.520 --> 1:36:10.200]  alex join the team we're robbing everyone i mean it's a big
[1:36:10.200 --> 1:36:13.560]  joke to them do you get the same thing out of these people
[1:36:13.560 --> 1:36:18.200]  i don't in the parliament no i'm dealing with people who are not as clever as
[1:36:18.200 --> 1:36:21.800]  that i'm dealing people with people are fundamentally stupid
[1:36:21.800 --> 1:36:25.400]  a lot of them who haven't had the benefit of what i would regard as a formal
[1:36:25.400 --> 1:36:29.480]  education you heard in that the speech that i made at the beginning
[1:36:29.480 --> 1:36:32.920]  uh... that which i made to the parliament we're dealing with people who think
[1:36:32.920 --> 1:36:36.360]  that carbon dioxide is some sort of polluting
[1:36:36.360 --> 1:36:39.720]  i'm dealing with people who don't know the difference between carbon and carbon
[1:36:39.720 --> 1:36:42.920]  dioxide i'm dealing with a difference between people who don't know the
[1:36:42.920 --> 1:36:46.040]  difference between carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide
[1:36:46.040 --> 1:36:49.640]  i'm dealing with people who are almost incredibly stupid
[1:36:49.640 --> 1:36:53.400]  uh... and they are deliberately placed there by the main parties
[1:36:53.400 --> 1:36:57.480]  not to make a fuss so when it comes to things like kopenhagen you're actually
[1:36:57.480 --> 1:37:02.200]  dealing with members of my committee who actually believe this nonsense
[1:37:02.200 --> 1:37:05.960]  and they believe this nonsense because they want to believe it and of course
[1:37:05.960 --> 1:37:10.280]  there's nobody so gullible as somebody who wants to believe something that
[1:37:10.280 --> 1:37:13.720]  they've been told because it actually now is a threat
[1:37:13.720 --> 1:37:18.040]  through every committee uh... if this green thread that runs
[1:37:18.040 --> 1:37:21.480]  it's a power grab it means that we can grab more power
[1:37:21.480 --> 1:37:26.440]  all the time from the people undermine the democratic situation because if we
[1:37:26.440 --> 1:37:30.440]  don't take away these powers that people have died for under a democratic
[1:37:30.440 --> 1:37:34.920]  society for years that the world is going to end it's a wonderful line alex
[1:37:34.920 --> 1:37:38.600]  isn't it we know that we're breaking with with democratic
[1:37:38.600 --> 1:37:41.560]  tradition we know we're doing things that people don't want
[1:37:41.560 --> 1:37:45.560]  but if we don't do this it we're doing this to save themselves
[1:37:45.560 --> 1:37:48.520]  we're doing this to save the people to save the planet
[1:37:48.520 --> 1:37:53.320]  it's a superb one-liner and of course in all the state schools in the united
[1:37:53.320 --> 1:37:58.280]  kingdom this is being pushed forward uh... under the special system that they
[1:37:58.280 --> 1:38:03.080]  have now in english state schools where they are told teachers are told
[1:38:03.080 --> 1:38:05.880]  what they can teach how they can teach it
[1:38:05.880 --> 1:38:09.320]  most of the information in our country comes from television
[1:38:09.320 --> 1:38:14.520]  television most television here is bbc uh... all the senior appointments of
[1:38:14.520 --> 1:38:17.800]  the bbc the director general the governor the presenters
[1:38:17.800 --> 1:38:20.920]  are all employees of number ten downing street
[1:38:20.920 --> 1:38:25.320]  uh... because that's how the system works so there's this absolute relentless
[1:38:25.320 --> 1:38:29.720]  barrage uh... of of of bogus junk science
[1:38:29.720 --> 1:38:33.640]  uh... that's been pushed at the people uh... and it's been going on now for
[1:38:33.640 --> 1:38:37.880]  ages uh... and and but what is interesting enough
[1:38:37.880 --> 1:38:41.960]  that still the Times newspaper did a survey a little while ago just a few
[1:38:41.960 --> 1:38:45.640]  weeks ago that said over 50 percent of ordinary people don't
[1:38:45.640 --> 1:38:51.800]  believe a word of it so there's still plenty of hope
[1:38:51.800 --> 1:38:56.600]  absolutely there is a lot of hope because this is undemocratic
[1:38:56.600 --> 1:39:00.600]  it is tyrannical and and in history
[1:39:00.600 --> 1:39:04.440]  if people just continue to tell the truth and continue to expose
[1:39:04.440 --> 1:39:09.880]  uh... a fraud it will implode here's the problem though
[1:39:09.880 --> 1:39:14.360]  even though they've been exposed to scam artist as frauds
[1:39:14.360 --> 1:39:18.760]  the establishment just continues on
[1:39:18.760 --> 1:39:24.680]  down the same path and they're so over the top in their fraud
[1:39:24.680 --> 1:39:29.480]  uh... three years ago i interviewed david the Rothschild the heir to the
[1:39:29.480 --> 1:39:33.880]  largest Rothschild fortune who was then billed as savior of the
[1:39:33.880 --> 1:39:38.600]  planet here he is on the cover of outside magazine
[1:39:38.600 --> 1:39:45.640]  the hero gene how to tap into yours and it actually says in here that he's like
[1:39:45.640 --> 1:39:49.000]  jesus christ i guess the Rothschilds always thought they were the
[1:39:49.000 --> 1:39:52.840]  merovingian line and so it says he is a savior
[1:39:52.840 --> 1:39:58.040]  he is a christ i mean this is a new religion al gore said they're going
[1:39:58.040 --> 1:40:04.120]  into religion the plastic jesus and then i have al gore here
[1:40:04.120 --> 1:40:07.480]  saying he is the this is newsweek the eco
[1:40:07.480 --> 1:40:11.880]  profit and it says he's the thinking man thinking man saving us
[1:40:11.880 --> 1:40:17.000]  when i had Rothschild on he said i said why are the ice caps on mars
[1:40:17.000 --> 1:40:20.600]  melting they've since started getting larger again because the sun's cooled
[1:40:20.600 --> 1:40:25.240]  off and he said because the mars is closer to the sun than the earth
[1:40:25.240 --> 1:40:29.160]  and i said no mars is the next planet out
[1:40:29.160 --> 1:40:32.440]  and i said why are the moons on jupiter and Saturn melting and he said well
[1:40:32.440 --> 1:40:36.680]  they're closer to the sun than the earth and i said no they're not
[1:40:36.680 --> 1:40:40.520]  and and you know he laughed at me not because he didn't know
[1:40:40.520 --> 1:40:43.480]  but he thought my audience was like the general public
[1:40:43.480 --> 1:40:46.840]  so dumb i mean al gore didn't invent the internet
[1:40:46.840 --> 1:40:50.680]  uh polar bears aren't drowning uh their numbers are way up
[1:40:50.680 --> 1:40:56.680]  but they know carbon isn't carbon dioxide they know all this but they
[1:40:56.680 --> 1:41:00.840]  they just they're so over the top that they just keep getting away with it
[1:41:00.840 --> 1:41:06.840]  how do you counter this level of uh just over the top in your
[1:41:06.840 --> 1:41:10.840]  face this i think what we need to do and we've started
[1:41:10.840 --> 1:41:14.040]  over here we we haven't got that far along the road yet
[1:41:14.040 --> 1:41:17.560]  but my party the united kingdom independence party
[1:41:17.560 --> 1:41:22.680]  was born out of ordinary people the ordinary man and we have an expression
[1:41:22.680 --> 1:41:25.800]  over here the ordinary man on the cap of omni bar
[1:41:25.800 --> 1:41:29.080]  it's just you know the ordinary you call it i think you call him an ordinary
[1:41:29.080 --> 1:41:32.680]  joe or you call him joe six pack and these people
[1:41:32.680 --> 1:41:36.040]  you've gotta have faith in them i don't think they're nearly as stupid as the
[1:41:36.040 --> 1:41:40.120]  liberal middle-class elite think they are they know they're being conned they
[1:41:40.120 --> 1:41:44.120]  know they're being lied to uh and they're voting for us now when when we
[1:41:44.120 --> 1:41:47.400]  have a proportional representation system when we get away from the two
[1:41:47.400 --> 1:41:51.000]  party system which we have uh for our european elections
[1:41:51.000 --> 1:41:55.320]  they feel that they can vote for us uh and they do vote for this and they're in
[1:41:55.320 --> 1:41:58.360]  their millions uh and now what we need to do
[1:41:58.360 --> 1:42:02.600]  is uh we're going to continue with this we're putting 500 candidates up for the
[1:42:02.600 --> 1:42:06.920]  west minster elections in may that's virtually a complete ticket
[1:42:06.920 --> 1:42:13.560]  uh of um of of u-kip uh people uh so everybody in every constituency can say
[1:42:13.560 --> 1:42:17.240]  just a minute i have got an alternative and i think the same
[1:42:17.240 --> 1:42:22.280]  thing needs to happen in america um because you do lead the world you will
[1:42:22.280 --> 1:42:25.080]  always lead the world for the foreseeable future
[1:42:25.080 --> 1:42:29.320]  and you can turn this round and i think if people could look to america the new
[1:42:29.320 --> 1:42:33.560]  world if you will uh by doing something like this i think it would be fabulous
[1:42:33.560 --> 1:42:37.400]  and if i'll be it for me to suggest what you should call that party
[1:42:37.400 --> 1:42:40.680]  but i would call it the american constitution party
[1:42:40.680 --> 1:42:44.520]  because most of what's going on as i say in america and the same thing in the
[1:42:44.520 --> 1:42:48.040]  united kingdom is actually a breach of constitution
[1:42:48.040 --> 1:42:51.480]  and if you could get back to your constitution i mean just looking at this
[1:42:51.480 --> 1:42:55.000]  uh that the situation within topol looking at climate
[1:42:55.000 --> 1:42:59.960]  looking at even at uh the new metham the new health care bill that's coming
[1:42:59.960 --> 1:43:03.240]  through uh congress and the senate that you're dealing with out there at the
[1:43:03.240 --> 1:43:06.920]  moment that is completely alien to the american constitution
[1:43:06.920 --> 1:43:10.440]  it says nowhere that i can see in the american constitution
[1:43:10.440 --> 1:43:13.480]  that you are responsible for your neighborhood health bills
[1:43:13.480 --> 1:43:17.240]  but even worse than that even if you're for socialism which is alien to our
[1:43:17.240 --> 1:43:20.680]  system which creates dependency and corruption
[1:43:20.680 --> 1:43:25.400]  and waste obama is massively cutting medicare and medicaid
[1:43:25.400 --> 1:43:29.240]  while jacking up taxes and prison time
[1:43:29.240 --> 1:43:34.360]  if you don't uh get the insurance and uh if you tell your doctor you don't want
[1:43:34.360 --> 1:43:37.800]  a certain treatment the government throws you off the rolls and it does
[1:43:37.800 --> 1:43:41.320]  create government bureaucracies that decide
[1:43:41.320 --> 1:43:45.640]  what treatment you get it does give you rationing i'll never forget
[1:43:45.640 --> 1:43:48.920]  three or four years ago right before gordon brown got into power
[1:43:48.920 --> 1:43:52.520]  i watched tony blare in the house of commons during prime minister's questions
[1:43:52.520 --> 1:43:57.000]  on c span and he admitted one person one member of the parliament
[1:43:57.000 --> 1:44:00.360]  got up and said of the house of commons got up and said
[1:44:00.360 --> 1:44:04.120]  well my constituent had to wait 18 months for a brain tumor
[1:44:04.120 --> 1:44:08.520]  um operation normally it's over 90 percent
[1:44:08.520 --> 1:44:12.600]  operable but because she had to wait so long she died and tony blare said yes
[1:44:12.600 --> 1:44:16.600]  it's true that happens and we're working on that i mean i don't think the average
[1:44:16.600 --> 1:44:22.120]  american realizes that under the european socialist health care model
[1:44:22.120 --> 1:44:26.280]  that a lot of hellish stuff happens can you fill people in here who may be in
[1:44:26.280 --> 1:44:30.280]  the dark about that sir yes we we did what you're what you're doing
[1:44:30.280 --> 1:44:37.640]  now we did in 1946 1947 we got rid of a perfectly good
[1:44:37.640 --> 1:44:41.560]  health system uh which was based on individuals and
[1:44:41.560 --> 1:44:45.240]  individuals uh relationships with their own doctors and their own local
[1:44:45.240 --> 1:44:49.400]  hospitals uh which were built on some part charitable
[1:44:49.400 --> 1:44:53.000]  status part fee paid status uh and they brought in
[1:44:53.000 --> 1:44:56.200]  this terrible monolith called the national health system
[1:44:56.200 --> 1:45:00.440]  and the national health system uh we have bred a monster that you wouldn't
[1:45:00.440 --> 1:45:04.520]  believe it's the biggest employer in europe it costs
[1:45:04.520 --> 1:45:08.120]  literally billions and billions and billions of pounds a year
[1:45:08.120 --> 1:45:13.560]  we've just wasted eight billion pounds but 10 over 10 billion dollars on a
[1:45:13.560 --> 1:45:17.960]  failed i t system nothing in the national health system works
[1:45:17.960 --> 1:45:21.720]  uh it's a sacred cow over here would you believe
[1:45:21.720 --> 1:45:25.960]  that now we have more administrators in the system than we have
[1:45:25.960 --> 1:45:29.800]  hospital beds this is the sort of lunacy that you get
[1:45:29.800 --> 1:45:33.560]  and i'd be reading through the bill i'm not an expert on it
[1:45:33.560 --> 1:45:37.800]  but i would beg you and i'd beg all your listeners for goodness sake right to
[1:45:37.800 --> 1:45:41.640]  whoever does represent you and say for god's sake don't vote for this
[1:45:41.640 --> 1:45:46.120]  this will be a disaster well look at the va i don't quite know how it's
[1:45:46.120 --> 1:45:50.520]  happened but you seem to have elected a socialist president and i i don't know
[1:45:50.520 --> 1:45:54.360]  how that happened well look at the va i mean
[1:45:54.360 --> 1:45:58.440]  hellish health care for our veterans uh more than half the money gets spent on
[1:45:58.440 --> 1:46:03.240]  administration not on the health care and
[1:46:03.240 --> 1:46:09.080]  reading this bill uh it is just a giant boondoggle it it it gives the insurance
[1:46:09.080 --> 1:46:12.920]  companies government immunity it gives the hospitals immunity
[1:46:12.920 --> 1:46:17.000]  and and you talk about globalization global governance
[1:46:17.000 --> 1:46:21.320]  all these things that are happening they have to get rid of local control to the
[1:46:21.320 --> 1:46:25.560]  national level if the national is going to be handed over to the
[1:46:25.560 --> 1:46:29.160]  international and we've interviewed nigel farage
[1:46:29.160 --> 1:46:33.000]  former leader of your party and others we've interviewed lord montan and others
[1:46:33.000 --> 1:46:37.000]  who talk about global governance the new head of the european union as you know
[1:46:37.000 --> 1:46:40.760]  herman von rupee says this is the first year of global governance
[1:46:40.760 --> 1:46:44.040]  they believe the kopenhagen treaty was the first year of global governance
[1:46:44.040 --> 1:46:47.880]  can you speak to this pan global europe
[1:46:47.880 --> 1:46:51.000]  that the eu talks about the european union model
[1:46:51.000 --> 1:46:55.400]  taking over the planet through treaties and i remind listeners three years ago
[1:46:55.400 --> 1:47:00.280]  george bush signed a transatlantic treaty with the spp security prosperity
[1:47:00.280 --> 1:47:03.880]  partnership with the european union so this integration
[1:47:03.880 --> 1:47:07.000]  is far along under stealth can you speak to
[1:47:07.000 --> 1:47:11.080]  their master plan uh yes certainly i uh...
[1:47:11.080 --> 1:47:14.840]  all i can tell so far is that we're dealing with a we're dealing with a
[1:47:14.840 --> 1:47:18.200]  sort of a european soviet system and of course
[1:47:18.200 --> 1:47:23.400]  all we need to do then is if we could if we if we then have a north american or
[1:47:23.400 --> 1:47:27.000]  american system which is similar and and it's going that way
[1:47:27.000 --> 1:47:30.280]  uh every day you get closer to that situation
[1:47:30.280 --> 1:47:34.040]  it's only a matter of time before those two power blocks come
[1:47:34.040 --> 1:47:36.840]  come together the only thing at the moment that is
[1:47:36.840 --> 1:47:40.040]  stopping that going forward to the even faster rate
[1:47:40.040 --> 1:47:43.800]  is the fundamental hostility in the european
[1:47:43.800 --> 1:47:47.640]  uh... uh... bureaucracy and parliament a fundamental
[1:47:47.640 --> 1:47:52.440]  hostility to the united states a fundamental hostility to the concept of
[1:47:52.440 --> 1:47:56.840]  uh... free trade and capitalism with the fundamental hostility to this
[1:47:56.840 --> 1:48:01.080]  so that there's actually a sort of a uh... theoretical
[1:48:01.080 --> 1:48:04.520]  problem that needs to be overcome but as soon as that is overcome
[1:48:04.520 --> 1:48:07.720]  you've got to understand that these as i'm sure you're listening to
[1:48:07.720 --> 1:48:12.840]  that that that the senior politicians uh... they don't have anything to do
[1:48:12.840 --> 1:48:16.520]  with the mhs they go into private wards they're privately looked after
[1:48:16.520 --> 1:48:19.560]  if they have a brain tumor it's dealt with immediately
[1:48:19.560 --> 1:48:24.520]  uh... but senior politicians do not go to do not go send their children to the
[1:48:24.520 --> 1:48:27.560]  same schools they do not go to the same hospital
[1:48:27.560 --> 1:48:30.440]  uh... did you know for example i i wonder if you did
[1:48:30.440 --> 1:48:34.760]  that the bureaucracy in brothels uh... all the civil servant bureaucracy
[1:48:34.760 --> 1:48:38.440]  which is enormous don't pay tax did you know that they don't pay income
[1:48:38.440 --> 1:48:42.680]  taxes salaries are free of tax so consequently the more they vote for
[1:48:42.680 --> 1:48:46.280]  centralism statism and high tax and high spending
[1:48:46.280 --> 1:48:49.560]  they're actually out of the loop themselves now that's a key point you
[1:48:49.560 --> 1:48:54.120]  just made is unaffected that's a key point our own congress here
[1:48:54.120 --> 1:48:57.640]  exempts themselves for most of their fines and fees
[1:48:57.640 --> 1:49:01.720]  uh... there's a law that they have to pay taxes but fifty plus percent
[1:49:01.720 --> 1:49:06.200]  have been caught just not paying go back over that though
[1:49:06.200 --> 1:49:10.840]  because i was not aware of that uh... i mean i knew that that went on in a lot
[1:49:10.840 --> 1:49:15.000]  of communist countries they are exempt from their own taxes
[1:49:15.000 --> 1:49:21.640]  that is the greatest mark of tyranny is when you it's like animal farm
[1:49:21.640 --> 1:49:25.080]  uh... you know four legs good two legs better
[1:49:25.080 --> 1:49:28.760]  i mean this is just unbelievable say that again i'm i'm
[1:49:28.760 --> 1:49:32.600]  i'm not doing a double take here but but but but something called a sort of
[1:49:32.600 --> 1:49:35.640]  but but but the emotional sort of uh...
[1:49:35.640 --> 1:49:40.280]  international tax which is which is put on the bureaucrats
[1:49:40.280 --> 1:49:43.880]  uh... which is very it's only marginal it's something like ten percent
[1:49:43.880 --> 1:49:48.840]  with everybody else in europe including me incident is many p i pay british tax
[1:49:48.840 --> 1:49:52.120]  i pay about forty five percent of my income in tax
[1:49:52.120 --> 1:49:55.160]  uh... but the actual bureaucracy which makes the laws
[1:49:55.160 --> 1:49:58.840]  so the people who actually make the law
[1:49:58.840 --> 1:50:02.760]  do not pay taxes as ordinary individuals
[1:50:02.760 --> 1:50:06.920]  they pay very marginal tax they also don't pay vat
[1:50:06.920 --> 1:50:10.840]  so they drive big range row but they buy a brand new range row from a sadist and
[1:50:10.840 --> 1:50:15.000]  bnw and there's no vat now vat on the continent on the car
[1:50:15.000 --> 1:50:19.160]  is twenty percent so you imagine an immediate twenty percent discount on
[1:50:19.160 --> 1:50:22.040]  your new car but they it's just like the
[1:50:22.040 --> 1:50:26.360]  savior system it's just like the polly bureau unbelievable yeah
[1:50:26.360 --> 1:50:29.880]  everybody standing in sausage lines but all the communist officials have two or
[1:50:29.880 --> 1:50:34.600]  three vellas and race horses so they are exempt
[1:50:34.600 --> 1:50:40.840]  they are a superclass who give themselves immunity from taxes just like
[1:50:40.840 --> 1:50:45.960]  interpol and the u n can run around the world engaging whenever crimes they
[1:50:45.960 --> 1:50:48.280]  want and they're given diplomatic immunity
[1:50:48.280 --> 1:50:52.440]  this is the internationalist superclass that roth cop
[1:50:52.440 --> 1:50:57.240]  talks about his book superclass our final segment with our amazing guest
[1:50:57.240 --> 1:51:01.480]  european union member of parliament men are you urinating more frequently

[1:52:03.880 --> 1:52:08.120]  this is our last chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this
[1:52:08.120 --> 1:52:11.080]  agenda they'll be pulling the rug from underneath
[1:52:11.080 --> 1:52:14.280]  americans at home i've turned a tremendous influence
[1:52:14.280 --> 1:52:18.680]  on our president in congress and they really are calling the shots i think

[1:54:19.000 --> 1:54:24.920]  sololensky thesis which has been classified has been released in full
[1:54:24.920 --> 1:54:29.080]  we were reading over this some during the break it is absolute communism how
[1:54:29.080 --> 1:54:33.240]  she's a communist oh god help us i mean how did we ever
[1:54:33.240 --> 1:54:37.000]  let this folks communist killed three four five times
[1:54:37.000 --> 1:54:39.720]  depending on which numbers you look at more than hitler
[1:54:39.720 --> 1:54:44.680]  i mean there's nothing worse than communist these are just dirty thieves
[1:54:44.680 --> 1:54:47.800]  they don't care about the poor and they know it
[1:54:47.800 --> 1:54:51.720]  look i was having an incredible conversation too with the european union
[1:54:51.720 --> 1:54:56.280]  member of parliament godfrey bloom i didn't know
[1:54:56.280 --> 1:55:00.200]  that they were exempt from tax during the break i googled it there was mainstream
[1:55:00.200 --> 1:55:04.440]  news he told me that the european union bureaucrats
[1:55:04.440 --> 1:55:10.280]  that that the average brit doesn't even know this then he went further
[1:55:10.280 --> 1:55:15.960]  explaining this to me uh continue sir yeah they don't pay any tax they pay a
[1:55:15.960 --> 1:55:19.560]  standard basic rate of tax which is something a minimal amount like 10
[1:55:19.560 --> 1:55:22.520]  percent it's a token amount uh they don't pay any
[1:55:22.520 --> 1:55:26.440]  um any sales tax as you call it over there when they buy a new car
[1:55:26.440 --> 1:55:30.360]  which is 20 percent so their new Mercedes is 20 percent cheaper than anybody
[1:55:30.360 --> 1:55:33.480]  else's uh so they they're always voting for big
[1:55:33.480 --> 1:55:37.480]  government they're voting for more tax they're voting for more spending and yet
[1:55:37.480 --> 1:55:42.760]  they don't contribute to any of this well our founders went to war over
[1:55:42.760 --> 1:55:45.720]  taxation without representation you already have that because they're
[1:55:45.720 --> 1:55:49.720]  unelected but this is even worse they are openly
[1:55:49.720 --> 1:55:54.840]  do as i say not as i do i mean that is that is tyranny i mean it doesn't get
[1:55:54.840 --> 1:55:58.920]  any more bona fide than that it's interesting you made a point
[1:55:58.920 --> 1:56:01.720]  earlier elix about the east europeans you know
[1:56:01.720 --> 1:56:05.400]  some of the east europeans who weren't part of the communist regime
[1:56:05.400 --> 1:56:09.640]  the ordinary the ordinary working people in places like poland of the check
[1:56:09.640 --> 1:56:12.840]  republic are suddenly beginning to realize
[1:56:12.840 --> 1:56:16.600]  what they've stepped into and and it was the check president
[1:56:16.600 --> 1:56:21.800]  president plows on his outgoing speech uh in the parliament said you know i know
[1:56:21.800 --> 1:56:25.240]  all about this i i i i went to prison under the
[1:56:25.240 --> 1:56:29.400]  soviet regime and what we're seeing is a soviet regime
[1:56:29.400 --> 1:56:33.640]  the european union is totally modelled on the soviet system
[1:56:33.640 --> 1:56:37.880]  uh it isn't modelled on the united states people are being told in western
[1:56:37.880 --> 1:56:41.160]  europe uh but the european union is basically the
[1:56:41.160 --> 1:56:44.360]  basic pattern is the united states it's nothing of the sort
[1:56:44.360 --> 1:56:48.360]  it's the soviet union and all these things i've been talking about today
[1:56:48.360 --> 1:56:52.280]  prove it do they not and for those that haven't studied this
[1:56:52.280 --> 1:56:56.120]  parliamentary setup in the bureaucracy it really is set up like the poet
[1:56:56.120 --> 1:56:58.840]  bureau it really is set up to do whatever it wants
[1:56:58.840 --> 1:57:02.120]  whenever it wants it really is dictatorial and now
[1:57:02.120 --> 1:57:05.240]  they're saying they have eu arrest warrants and obama
[1:57:05.240 --> 1:57:10.040]  has amended the inner poll agreement to allow them to do basically whatever they
[1:57:10.040 --> 1:57:13.960]  want inside the united states
[1:57:13.960 --> 1:57:19.640]  if the european arrest warrant uh well if if if if somebody says stay in austria
[1:57:19.640 --> 1:57:22.520]  for example that they don't like gypsies and that's
[1:57:22.520 --> 1:57:25.880]  considered to be xenophobia under the austrian law
[1:57:25.880 --> 1:57:30.200]  they can arrest you when you go home with a european arrest warrant
[1:57:30.200 --> 1:57:33.640]  they don't need a they don't need a magistrates warrant they don't need a
[1:57:33.640 --> 1:57:37.880]  primer facing case there's no concept of habeas corpus
[1:57:37.880 --> 1:57:42.040]  so they can arrest you a foreigner can arrest you he can take you to austria
[1:57:42.040 --> 1:57:46.280]  they can imprison you without charge for as long as they like
[1:57:46.280 --> 1:57:49.960]  and this happened to an englishman only about three months ago
[1:57:49.960 --> 1:57:53.000]  and people were saying how on earth could this happen and it's happened
[1:57:53.000 --> 1:57:57.000]  because nobody knows about it there's a deliberate disinformation
[1:57:57.000 --> 1:58:01.400]  and most of it stems from our own bbc our own british broadcasting
[1:58:01.400 --> 1:58:05.560]  uh service which has such a wonderful representation in the war and post war
[1:58:05.560 --> 1:58:10.280]  has now been taken over by these people and so people just don't know and of
[1:58:10.280 --> 1:58:15.880]  course information and so does starlin said knowledge is power and if people
[1:58:15.880 --> 1:58:19.080]  don't have the knowledge and they won't find it in the newspapers
[1:58:19.080 --> 1:58:23.400]  and they won't find it on bbc they're gonna have to work to find it but it's
[1:58:23.400 --> 1:58:26.760]  not that difficult you just have to make an effort
[1:58:26.760 --> 1:58:30.520]  well he's an economist he's a member of the european union parliament he's god

[2:00:48.520 --> 2:00:51.880]  with provocateur events that he predicted the last year
[2:00:51.880 --> 2:00:55.480]  what he thinks about the underwear bomber the fact that he was ushered on the
[2:00:55.480 --> 2:00:58.440]  plane some one was videotaping him the
[2:00:58.440 --> 2:01:01.320]  entire time he was on board the plane he was on terror
[2:01:01.320 --> 2:01:06.280]  list but ordered to be let on his parents warned the fbi
[2:01:06.280 --> 2:01:09.160]  the fact that they're now saying they want to attack yemen and in the months
[2:01:09.160 --> 2:01:14.440]  before massed us troops in yemen for a new war there just like afghanistan
[2:01:14.440 --> 2:01:18.120]  we're going to talk to gerald salente about all of that
[2:01:18.120 --> 2:01:21.480]  today gerald of course really doesn't need much
[2:01:21.480 --> 2:01:27.080]  of a introduction but he is the martial artist of trends forecasting
[2:01:27.080 --> 2:01:30.680]  and the purpose of trends forecasting is to provide insights and directions and
[2:01:30.680 --> 2:01:35.320]  anticipation of what the future may bring and be prepared for the unexpected

[2:01:39.400 --> 2:01:43.480]  trends researchers in the world the website is trendsresearch.com
[2:01:43.480 --> 2:01:48.520]  and joining us from his offices in new york state is gerald
[2:01:48.520 --> 2:01:50.600]  salente gerald good to have you here with us
[2:01:50.600 --> 2:01:55.000]  oh it's always great being on with you alex well we're about to go to break in
[2:01:55.000 --> 2:01:58.200]  three minutes but out of the gates what do you think
[2:01:58.200 --> 2:02:02.280]  about the terror scare oh we've all got to be body scanned
[2:02:02.280 --> 2:02:07.000]  we've all got to be prisoners on the planes we we we have to keep our hands
[2:02:07.000 --> 2:02:09.640]  in our laps nothing in our laps no electronics
[2:02:09.640 --> 2:02:15.160]  the government's going to save us well you know as you know we had predicted
[2:02:15.160 --> 2:02:18.680]  terror 2010 it was going to be an increase
[2:02:18.680 --> 2:02:22.120]  and as the economies continue to decline
[2:02:22.120 --> 2:02:26.440]  they're going to look for more and more excuses to make the people fearful
[2:02:26.440 --> 2:02:29.960]  so that our minds go off the bad economy
[2:02:29.960 --> 2:02:35.240]  and go on to terror and government of course is going to pretend
[2:02:35.240 --> 2:02:40.040]  that they can save us and protect us and of course we all know better
[2:02:40.040 --> 2:02:46.200]  so they're going to use any incident be it false leg or real
[2:02:46.200 --> 2:02:51.480]  to keep gaining more control because as we can see what's going on here
[2:02:51.480 --> 2:02:56.200]  is that obama is outbushing bush
[2:02:56.200 --> 2:03:01.320]  absolutely we got a few minutes before we got a break how is he outbushing bush
[2:03:01.320 --> 2:03:04.920]  well go to the patriot act they're bringing it to new levels
[2:03:04.920 --> 2:03:10.760]  they've increased the war into pakistan even bush was hesitant about sending in
[2:03:10.760 --> 2:03:14.280]  predator drones into a sovereign country
[2:03:14.280 --> 2:03:20.760]  he's escalated the war into afghanistan and now as most people
[2:03:20.760 --> 2:03:25.240]  don't know and you reported about a couple of weeks ago
[2:03:25.240 --> 2:03:28.280]  under obama's direction they've been fighting
[2:03:28.280 --> 2:03:33.560]  the yemen war alongside saudi arabia providing them with intelligence
[2:03:33.560 --> 2:03:38.200]  and ostensibly they've been providing air support and cruise missiles
[2:03:38.200 --> 2:03:42.520]  so he's taking this this global war on terror
[2:03:42.520 --> 2:03:45.720]  so it was really spreading it around the globe
[2:03:45.720 --> 2:03:49.240]  you predicted two years ago on this show they would be going into africa in a
[2:03:49.240 --> 2:03:53.240]  big way that's now happening yes and it's very
[2:03:53.240 --> 2:03:57.400]  important to watch what's going on in yemen yemen of course borders saudi
[2:03:57.400 --> 2:04:00.040]  arabia the saudi's are in the middle of a
[2:04:00.040 --> 2:04:05.080]  fight there for civil in a civil war over a hundred saudi soldiers have been
[2:04:05.080 --> 2:04:10.840]  killed many more captured the point being if there's a strike on a
[2:04:10.840 --> 2:04:15.240]  saudi oil facility which is a high probability
[2:04:15.240 --> 2:04:20.280]  as this yemen war expands all bets are off for the economy
[2:04:20.280 --> 2:04:24.840]  we're going to get hit with an oil shock to get this false recovery
[2:04:24.840 --> 2:04:29.320]  it'll go straight toward the greatest depression well over a year ago here
[2:04:29.320 --> 2:04:32.200]  back in october when they passed the bank or takeover bill
[2:04:32.200 --> 2:04:36.040]  you and many other economists we had on uh said that
[2:04:36.040 --> 2:04:40.040]  it would be a sugar high that that that real jobs would keep contracting but
[2:04:40.040 --> 2:04:44.040]  big banks insurance companies they would announce big profits which they
[2:04:44.040 --> 2:04:46.600]  did but the real economy's imploding now they're
[2:04:46.600 --> 2:04:49.960]  admitting the sugar highs wearing off we'll talk about what's happening with
[2:04:49.960 --> 2:04:52.600]  the economy and a lot more as we look at trends
[2:04:52.600 --> 2:04:58.040]  in the 2010 with the master of trends gerald salenta
[2:04:58.040 --> 2:05:01.240]  hi folks this is alex jones and i want to tell you about the silver lungs
[2:05:01.240 --> 2:05:05.080]  generator now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver
[2:05:05.080 --> 2:05:08.120]  and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream
[2:05:08.120 --> 2:05:12.120]  by breathing the solution through the lungs the respiratory system is the
[2:05:12.120 --> 2:05:15.400]  first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses
[2:05:15.400 --> 2:05:18.840]  the silver lungs generator infuses the respiratory system
[2:05:18.840 --> 2:05:23.240]  with your self-produced nano silver solutions and also delivers
[2:05:23.240 --> 2:05:26.840]  the silver nano particles instantly into the bloodstream
[2:05:26.840 --> 2:05:30.920]  with continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products
[2:05:30.920 --> 2:05:34.440]  you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver

[2:08:33.480 --> 2:08:37.960]  uh okay gerald salente i want to pick your brain today
[2:08:37.960 --> 2:08:41.480]  about the economy about other trends you see developing
[2:08:41.480 --> 2:08:47.640]  but finishing up with the terror uh what is your gut looking at the way they
[2:08:47.640 --> 2:08:51.880]  already had troops massed in yemen they were gearing up for this
[2:08:51.880 --> 2:08:55.880]  uh they ushered him on without a passport or id
[2:08:55.880 --> 2:08:59.800]  past security someone was filming him the whole time he was on the plane
[2:08:59.800 --> 2:09:03.160]  people thought that was strange looked like some type of drill
[2:09:03.160 --> 2:09:09.960]  his father warned people uh he was on the terror list but that was ignored
[2:09:09.960 --> 2:09:15.000]  on and on and on and now oh we've all got to accept the body scanners oh
[2:09:15.000 --> 2:09:20.200]  obama's got to launch new wars i mean if this isn't staged i tell you this is
[2:09:20.200 --> 2:09:23.240]  the luckiest thing in history for obama
[2:09:23.240 --> 2:09:27.880]  well again you know i i don't know it because there's always the other side
[2:09:27.880 --> 2:09:30.840]  of the story and that is the high level of
[2:09:30.840 --> 2:09:36.680]  incompetence from the government look who's the homeland security director
[2:09:36.680 --> 2:09:40.200]  janet napolitano are you kidding me or what
[2:09:40.200 --> 2:09:44.840]  homeland security of what i mean look at these people
[2:09:44.840 --> 2:09:48.440]  you know you know these people are out remember in high school and college
[2:09:48.440 --> 2:09:52.520]  the people that wanted to be the class president or the head of the student
[2:09:52.520 --> 2:09:56.280]  council that thought they were smarter than everybody else
[2:09:56.280 --> 2:09:59.960]  and they sucked up and glad-handed and brown nose
[2:09:59.960 --> 2:10:04.440]  and knew nothing well here they are they're telling all the rest of us how to
[2:10:04.440 --> 2:10:08.440]  think and how to act you know is it suspicious yes it is
[2:10:08.440 --> 2:10:12.760]  is the government totally incompetent look at what they're doing katrina
[2:10:12.760 --> 2:10:16.200]  quality rescue skills they still have a hole in the ground
[2:10:16.200 --> 2:10:19.400]  where 9 11 happened at the world trade center
[2:10:19.400 --> 2:10:23.640]  look at the wars they're prosecuting the military hasn't won a war
[2:10:23.640 --> 2:10:29.240]  since world war two oh i forgot granada they did a great job on that one so i
[2:10:29.240 --> 2:10:32.280]  mean you're not working with a bunch of incompetence as well
[2:10:32.280 --> 2:10:36.600]  so yeah look staged or so it could be a collusion
[2:10:36.600 --> 2:10:41.640]  but again when you put the whole mix together you know it it makes you wonder
[2:10:41.640 --> 2:10:45.320]  well that's what i'm saying i mean in every one of these shoe bombers you name
[2:10:45.320 --> 2:10:49.320]  it some special security person ushers them with fake
[2:10:49.320 --> 2:10:55.000]  ids or no id right up onto the plane and then meanwhile i've seen old people
[2:10:55.000 --> 2:10:58.520]  who look like they're on the edge of death with oxygen tanks
[2:10:58.520 --> 2:11:03.160]  literally being screamed at by tsa i mean i won't fly through houston
[2:11:03.160 --> 2:11:06.520]  george w bush george herbert walker bush airport
[2:11:06.520 --> 2:11:12.040]  because they literally scream at you like animals and they've got a bunch of
[2:11:12.040 --> 2:11:16.840]  bunch of people on power trips literally howling in there i mean it is
[2:11:16.840 --> 2:11:21.880]  it is otherworldly how screwed up things are so i understand
[2:11:21.880 --> 2:11:25.320]  what you're talking about about the ineptitude this just fits
[2:11:25.320 --> 2:11:30.360]  so much of the past mo we've seen with staged events and we know they stage
[2:11:30.360 --> 2:11:35.080]  things like gulf of tonkin and other events of course they have remember the
[2:11:35.080 --> 2:11:39.000]  main yeah i mean it goes on and on and and the other
[2:11:39.000 --> 2:11:44.760]  side of the story too who really did do the legislators or the president or
[2:11:44.760 --> 2:11:48.120]  the cabinet they don't care about stepped up security
[2:11:48.120 --> 2:11:52.440]  what we have to go through i hate to fly i try to go nowhere anymore
[2:11:52.440 --> 2:11:57.240]  because they have their own private jets they everything is paved for them
[2:11:57.240 --> 2:12:00.920]  they go to another country they have military attachés
[2:12:00.920 --> 2:12:04.440]  picking them up carrying their luggage boarding them on and taking them where
[2:12:04.440 --> 2:12:07.480]  they have to go so this is just another
[2:12:07.480 --> 2:12:11.720]  inconvenience if you will that's right that's why our military is in 190 something
[2:12:11.720 --> 2:12:15.240]  countries because they're butlers to all these corrupt people in con
[2:12:15.240 --> 2:12:18.280]  in congress i was talking to a european union member of parliament
[2:12:18.280 --> 2:12:23.080]  yesterday and he pointed out that the european union bureaucrats are exempt
[2:12:23.080 --> 2:12:27.240]  from e u taxes did you know that no i didn't i didn't know that that is
[2:12:27.240 --> 2:12:30.760]  incredible well the whole thing i get the whole game is
[2:12:30.760 --> 2:12:34.600]  incredible so as we're looking at this terrorist strike
[2:12:34.600 --> 2:12:41.800]  or the aborted one we're looking for 9 11 magnitude terrorist strikes in 2010
[2:12:41.800 --> 2:12:46.120]  and when it happens just like now for example has anybody asked
[2:12:46.120 --> 2:12:50.760]  if this guy why he did it what provoked him to it
[2:12:50.760 --> 2:12:55.880]  could it possibly be other than they hate our freedom and liberty
[2:12:55.880 --> 2:12:59.800]  could it possibly be that he's maybe
[2:12:59.800 --> 2:13:05.880]  disgusted with american foreign policy could it possibly be the
[2:13:05.880 --> 2:13:11.320]  hundreds of thousands of people that have been killed in the decades long war
[2:13:11.320 --> 2:13:14.600]  that americans been way america's been waging abroad
[2:13:14.600 --> 2:13:21.480]  in afghanistan in iraq and now in pakistan and here's what to worry about
[2:13:21.480 --> 2:13:27.960]  unlike iraq and afghanistan there are 300 000 approximately pakistanis
[2:13:27.960 --> 2:13:32.200]  living in the u.s now let's just suppose for a moment
[2:13:32.200 --> 2:13:35.720]  that you had a family member in the slot valley
[2:13:35.720 --> 2:13:39.720]  was south or north was iristan or wherever else
[2:13:39.720 --> 2:13:46.280]  and they've been slaughtered either by a predatory uh a predator drone of
[2:13:46.280 --> 2:13:50.280]  course they only do surgical strikes on quote suspected
[2:13:50.280 --> 2:13:54.360]  terrorists but they happen to wipe out your family in the meantime
[2:13:54.360 --> 2:14:00.760]  and the afghan army again instigated by the u.s waging this massive war
[2:14:00.760 --> 2:14:07.640]  where there are more refugees in south in south was iristan north was iristan
[2:14:07.640 --> 2:14:13.720]  in the slot valley then since the rwandan crisis in 1994
[2:14:13.720 --> 2:14:18.520]  do you think you'd want to seek revenge do you think you'd have to belong
[2:14:18.520 --> 2:14:23.320]  to an organization such as al-qaeda or you're plenty angry
[2:14:23.320 --> 2:14:26.760]  and now you have the means and the wherewithal
[2:14:26.760 --> 2:14:30.920]  of weapons of mass destruction to wreck the havoc
[2:14:30.920 --> 2:14:35.080]  that's been wrecked upon you to do unto others
[2:14:35.080 --> 2:14:39.560]  as they have been doing unto you and your family
[2:14:39.560 --> 2:14:43.560]  this is why we're going to see terror 2010
[2:14:43.560 --> 2:14:47.960]  and when it happens they'll be the same old story
[2:14:47.960 --> 2:14:51.320]  they hate our freedom and liberty and one other thing
[2:14:51.320 --> 2:14:54.920]  i love the line it comes from obama came from bush
[2:14:54.920 --> 2:14:58.920]  came from clinton it comes from all of them we're going to hunt down the
[2:14:58.920 --> 2:15:02.680]  terrorists we're going to bring them back to swift justice
[2:15:02.680 --> 2:15:07.480]  or words to that effect oh and we're going to catch every terrorist around
[2:15:07.480 --> 2:15:12.680]  they've been more elvis sightings than obama sightings
[2:15:13.240 --> 2:15:18.280]  well expanding on that if some of this terror occasionally is real
[2:15:18.280 --> 2:15:22.280]  any resistance it is dubbed terror if you hold your arm up when a cop's
[2:15:22.280 --> 2:15:25.400]  billy clubbing you it's now called terrorism or if they're about to throw
[2:15:25.400 --> 2:15:28.280]  you off the cliff and you try to hold onto the edge it's it's
[2:15:28.280 --> 2:15:31.080]  nightly news the greatest terror attack in history
[2:15:31.080 --> 2:15:35.240]  i mean our media is saying that if iran is hit and fights back in any way
[2:15:35.240 --> 2:15:37.800]  they're going to be nuked it's a new form of warfare
[2:15:37.800 --> 2:15:41.240]  we attack you first and then if you defend yourself
[2:15:41.240 --> 2:15:45.960]  we nuke you and and and and cry on tv and scare our nation of ninnies
[2:15:45.960 --> 2:15:49.800]  but but look the globalists know when they go in and stir up the muslims
[2:15:49.800 --> 2:15:52.760]  that that's going to cause them to strike back it's like going up and hitting
[2:15:52.760 --> 2:15:56.520]  a bees nest and then they get to take the american
[2:15:56.520 --> 2:15:59.400]  people's freedom so it's problem reaction solution
[2:15:59.400 --> 2:16:03.800]  the elite didn't get in power over being bozos and on top of it if these muslims
[2:16:03.800 --> 2:16:05.880]  really are just attacking us because they're mad
[2:16:05.880 --> 2:16:09.720]  don't they know that when they attack that makes our military come and invade
[2:16:09.720 --> 2:16:13.240]  don't they know that brings in the wrath
[2:16:13.240 --> 2:16:17.400]  well yes they do know what's the reports going out now however
[2:16:17.400 --> 2:16:21.240]  that there's another report about israel planning to
[2:16:21.240 --> 2:16:25.880]  do a quote surgical strike against the iranian nuclear facility
[2:16:25.880 --> 2:16:29.240]  that's the other big part you're right they're kicking all this off
[2:16:29.240 --> 2:16:33.480]  for the police state getting ready to go into iran because they know they'll be
[2:16:33.480 --> 2:16:36.840]  real terror attacks in this country if iran is hit
[2:16:36.840 --> 2:16:41.080]  go ahead i want to make this really clear if anybody
[2:16:41.080 --> 2:16:44.520]  attacks iran the united states or israel
[2:16:44.520 --> 2:16:49.560]  it's the beginning of world war three these are the persians let anyone
[2:16:49.560 --> 2:16:53.480]  forget there are 70 million of them and they're
[2:16:53.480 --> 2:16:58.120]  armed to the teeth they fought iraq for eight years
[2:16:58.120 --> 2:17:03.960]  they didn't give up one inch of territory and lost over a million people
[2:17:03.960 --> 2:17:07.800]  anybody thinks that they're going to beat iran
[2:17:07.800 --> 2:17:12.040]  well you know they're part of the military industrial complex maybe it's
[2:17:12.040 --> 2:17:17.240]  not beating them at all maybe it's just keep making money for prolonged war
[2:17:17.240 --> 2:17:21.640]  because anybody in their right mind knows that they're not going to go down
[2:17:21.640 --> 2:17:25.800]  in any way and this is also important we keep hearing about
[2:17:25.800 --> 2:17:30.440]  you know the great israeli military israel lost to lebanon
[2:17:30.440 --> 2:17:34.840]  they could like the united states they could bomb any country into oblivion
[2:17:34.840 --> 2:17:38.520]  but once you hit the ground it's a different story
[2:17:38.520 --> 2:17:42.360]  so with iran nobody's going to be successful
[2:17:42.360 --> 2:17:46.760]  attacking iran internally yeah they could bomb it to oblivion as i said it's
[2:17:46.760 --> 2:17:49.720]  the beginning of world war three there's no stopping it
[2:17:49.720 --> 2:17:53.640]  so if israel goes in and again there's those
[2:17:53.640 --> 2:17:57.320]  those those sabers being rattled now in the news
[2:17:57.320 --> 2:18:01.320]  if that happens we're going to be in for a hellish time
[2:18:01.320 --> 2:18:06.440]  in 2010 and probably for the rest of our lives
[2:18:07.080 --> 2:18:10.360]  do you believe israel's going to hit in 2010 i mean they're they're openly
[2:18:10.360 --> 2:18:13.240]  making noises saying they may go ahead and strike
[2:18:13.240 --> 2:18:16.840]  i don't believe so and i could be wrong i only say that because they've been
[2:18:16.840 --> 2:18:21.240]  saying this for a number of years and i don't know if they're trial balloons to
[2:18:21.240 --> 2:18:24.680]  see what kind of response they'll get back from washington
[2:18:24.680 --> 2:18:29.320]  because the latest it's the same story every administration for example
[2:18:29.320 --> 2:18:33.560]  every administration tells israel no you can't build any more
[2:18:33.560 --> 2:18:37.720]  any more housing developments on palestinian land you can't do it
[2:18:37.720 --> 2:18:42.040]  stop it's against international law and israel does it anyway
[2:18:42.040 --> 2:18:46.520]  and they're doing it again there's just an announcement yesterday for 600 more
[2:18:46.520 --> 2:18:52.360]  apartment units the administration says no stop israel says do it so israel
[2:18:52.360 --> 2:18:56.600]  couldn't be testing the united states to see what their response is
[2:18:56.600 --> 2:19:02.840]  but always remember that the more this country is involved militarily
[2:19:02.840 --> 2:19:07.720]  at any level the less freedoms that we the people have
[2:19:07.720 --> 2:19:11.080]  the worst the economy gets and we wrote about this
[2:19:11.080 --> 2:19:15.720]  over and over again when this bailout bubble bursts

[2:24:58.680 --> 2:25:04.360]  coming up in 2010 into 2011
[2:25:04.680 --> 2:25:10.840]  the markets collapsed in march of march 9th 2009
[2:25:10.840 --> 2:25:14.840]  the only thing that's happened is the world governments the central bankers
[2:25:14.840 --> 2:25:20.280]  have flooded the world with money to keep propping up the failing banks and
[2:25:20.280 --> 2:25:24.680]  brokerage firms to the tune of about six trillion dollars
[2:25:24.680 --> 2:25:28.360]  roughly but let's look at the real numbers and look let's look at really
[2:25:28.360 --> 2:25:34.520]  going on iceland grease estonia latvia
[2:25:34.520 --> 2:25:42.360]  latin ukraine ireland spain portugal us
[2:25:42.360 --> 2:25:47.720]  uk one after another countries are going under
[2:25:47.720 --> 2:25:50.840]  they're going bankrupt and they're ready to fail
[2:25:50.840 --> 2:25:54.280]  and meanwhile our mainstream media is telling us everything's wonderful while
[2:25:54.280 --> 2:25:57.960]  the big brokerage firms are quietly telling their wealthy
[2:25:57.960 --> 2:26:02.280]  investors hey you better get ready for a possible total collapse now
[2:26:02.280 --> 2:26:05.160]  when are you saying in 2010 because you actually said
[2:26:05.160 --> 2:26:08.920]  2009 when are you saying you're looking for another implosion
[2:26:08.920 --> 2:26:13.320]  no what i meant to say is in 2009 the markets collapsed
[2:26:13.320 --> 2:26:18.440]  but they propped them up in 2010 there's not going to be any more props the
[2:26:18.440 --> 2:26:23.320]  financial props got it are gone so now that that's why
[2:26:23.320 --> 2:26:27.720]  we're looking for the collapse to happen the commercial real estate market
[2:26:27.720 --> 2:26:31.400]  buy buy do buy we saw it happen oh it's okay
[2:26:31.400 --> 2:26:35.000]  nothing's wrong nothing's wrong that's what they tried to tell us
[2:26:35.000 --> 2:26:38.120]  that's the canary in the commercial real estate
[2:26:38.120 --> 2:26:43.400]  mine chef we're going to start seeing more and more commercial failures and
[2:26:43.400 --> 2:26:46.440]  they're going to dwarf the sub prime problem
[2:26:46.440 --> 2:26:50.280]  there's a story worth reading in today's new york times actually
[2:26:50.280 --> 2:26:55.880]  it's an op-ed piece from a previous story it's about the goldman sacks gang
[2:26:55.880 --> 2:27:00.760]  they have you know they always tell us what brilliant the most brilliant minds
[2:27:00.760 --> 2:27:04.840]  we need we need to pay a lot of money to get the most brilliant minds
[2:27:04.840 --> 2:27:08.840]  in finance yeah the most brilliant minds so they could pull off
[2:27:08.840 --> 2:27:12.520]  the most brilliant criminal schemes possible
[2:27:12.520 --> 2:27:17.000]  here's what they've done you can't make this stuff up but they did
[2:27:17.000 --> 2:27:23.080]  they call it a synthetic collateralized debt obligation
[2:27:23.080 --> 2:27:27.400]  a synthetic collateralized debt obligation what does that mean
[2:27:27.400 --> 2:27:32.200]  oh what it means is you invest with us and you're going to be guaranteed to
[2:27:32.200 --> 2:27:36.120]  get great returns so they sucker you in the
[2:27:36.120 --> 2:27:39.640]  goldman sacks gang for you to invest with them and
[2:27:39.640 --> 2:27:44.040]  meanwhile they're shorting the position knowing that it's going to fail
[2:27:44.040 --> 2:27:47.960]  it's in black and white and again you and many of other
[2:27:47.960 --> 2:27:51.800]  great guests we had said this a year ago now it's come out of the five-part
[2:27:51.800 --> 2:27:55.880]  siri mclatchy newspapers that goldman sacks engineered this whole thing
[2:27:55.880 --> 2:28:00.200]  to destroy their competition internally they were betting against housing
[2:28:00.200 --> 2:28:03.640]  while telling all their sucker customers to invest in it
[2:28:03.640 --> 2:28:09.720]  that's right it would be like you taking out an insurance policy with me
[2:28:09.720 --> 2:28:15.480]  giving me the money and then me killing you and then collecting on the policy
[2:28:15.480 --> 2:28:19.320]  that's what they're doing that's what these great minds
[2:28:19.320 --> 2:28:23.160]  that we have to pay all this money to to bail them out
[2:28:23.160 --> 2:28:25.960]  and to keep them like we're doing with fanny may
[2:28:25.960 --> 2:28:30.840]  and freddy mack on christmas eve and of course it's not really just a
[2:28:30.840 --> 2:28:34.360]  bailout they made money on the way up this is just their profit on the way
[2:28:34.360 --> 2:28:37.240]  down go ahead well the fanny may and freddy mack
[2:28:37.240 --> 2:28:42.360]  that they did on christmas eve we now the government has guaranteed them
[2:28:42.360 --> 2:28:46.200]  unlimited funds to keep the housing scam going
[2:28:46.200 --> 2:28:49.800]  you know nine out of ten mortgages are backed by the government
[2:28:49.800 --> 2:28:53.400]  and what did they do they gave the CEOs of these companies what
[2:28:53.400 --> 2:28:59.800]  a six million dollars salary i mean come on but they do it on christmas eve
[2:28:59.800 --> 2:29:04.440]  when nobody's watching so what we're looking for in 2010
[2:29:04.440 --> 2:29:09.160]  is the collapse and by the way when we're looking at the collapse of 2010
[2:29:09.160 --> 2:29:13.720]  we're also looking at the possible breakup of the european
[2:29:13.720 --> 2:29:18.920]  monetary union so for example i spoke about greece and portugal in ireland
[2:29:18.920 --> 2:29:25.000]  in spain greece for example their budget deficit is 13
[2:29:25.000 --> 2:29:31.400]  percent greater than their gdp under the economic
[2:29:31.400 --> 2:29:36.440]  monetary union regulations it can't exceed three percent
[2:29:36.440 --> 2:29:39.800]  we're going to see one country after another unable to meet
[2:29:39.800 --> 2:29:43.880]  that fake number which is what the which is what the EU was meant to do

[2:34:56.200 --> 2:35:03.240]  okay going back to gerald salente of the trends research
[2:35:03.240 --> 2:35:07.640]  dot com the trends research institute and we are
[2:35:07.640 --> 2:35:11.560]  going over a bunch of different issues with him he was talking about
[2:35:11.560 --> 2:35:16.280]  and again i got to hand it to gerald i remember him saying about six months ago
[2:35:16.280 --> 2:35:19.960]  look at europe perhaps breaking up it's going to be so bad and
[2:35:19.960 --> 2:35:23.640]  and and and our government's going to have peaceful revolution and
[2:35:23.640 --> 2:35:26.920]  you know it's over for them and then you know by 2012
[2:35:26.920 --> 2:35:31.000]  and then i started seeing mainstream news articles i saw one last week
[2:35:31.000 --> 2:35:35.640]  saying Greece and others may go under may bring down the european union
[2:35:35.640 --> 2:35:38.760]  my issue is the european union wants them deep in debt
[2:35:38.760 --> 2:35:42.600]  wants them under those controls so i think they'll just refinance the deals
[2:35:42.600 --> 2:35:45.560]  with them uh but but continuing gerald salente
[2:35:45.560 --> 2:35:50.200]  with what you see happening on the economy then domestically here
[2:35:50.200 --> 2:35:54.440]  as the economy goes down we're going to start seeing of course nothing goes
[2:35:54.440 --> 2:35:57.960]  straight down or up or down but we're still very bullish on
[2:35:57.960 --> 2:36:04.040]  gold prices we believe gold 2000 what's happened is that as Greece and
[2:36:04.040 --> 2:36:08.920]  eastern europe has been going under it of course sweden austria the rest have
[2:36:08.920 --> 2:36:12.280]  been financing it what they're doing is people are bailing
[2:36:12.280 --> 2:36:15.640]  out of the euro and then going into the dollar
[2:36:15.640 --> 2:36:18.760]  well that's like jumping out of one sinking ship
[2:36:18.760 --> 2:36:21.960]  and then jumping into the other sinking ship so
[2:36:21.960 --> 2:36:26.920]  temporarily we're going to have it look as though the dollars rebounding
[2:36:26.920 --> 2:36:31.240]  but this is very important in putting all the pieces together
[2:36:31.240 --> 2:36:35.400]  with a high probability of when terror strikes in 2010
[2:36:35.400 --> 2:36:41.400]  go back to what they did in in 2001 they closed down wall street if you had
[2:36:41.400 --> 2:36:45.320]  certificates of deposit like i did and tried to get them out of the bank like
[2:36:45.320 --> 2:36:48.600]  i did they wouldn't give them to me because wall street
[2:36:48.600 --> 2:36:54.280]  was closed and they said cds of financial instruments traded on the
[2:36:54.280 --> 2:36:58.360]  street now what they will do this time because the economy
[2:36:58.360 --> 2:37:03.000]  is in much worse shape than back then we believe they'll call a bank holiday
[2:37:03.000 --> 2:37:07.560]  they'll close the banks that also means that when they reopen
[2:37:07.560 --> 2:37:11.880]  is a very good probability that your money will be devalued
[2:37:11.880 --> 2:37:16.360]  as you will know alex what they did when fdr closed the banks
[2:37:16.360 --> 2:37:21.400]  repatriated to gold they had gold was so they made them sell it to back to the
[2:37:21.400 --> 2:37:23.880]  government at twenty dollars sixty seven
[2:37:23.880 --> 2:37:28.440]  dollars an ounce and then they repaid it what was it thirty five dollars an ounce
[2:37:28.440 --> 2:37:33.240]  so you lost forty percent of your value your money was devalued
[2:37:33.240 --> 2:37:39.320]  that's the kind of thing we fear now a financial crisis is looming terrorism
[2:37:39.320 --> 2:37:43.880]  is in the wings when it happens they will close down the
[2:37:43.880 --> 2:37:48.840]  financial system atms will close down you will only
[2:37:48.840 --> 2:37:52.200]  be able to get a certain amount of money back like they did in
[2:37:52.200 --> 2:37:55.640]  argentina and other failing company countries
[2:37:55.640 --> 2:38:00.840]  and when you get your money back it'll be worth a fraction of what it used to
[2:38:00.840 --> 2:38:04.040]  be worth that's what we're concerned about
[2:38:04.040 --> 2:38:07.720]  and again dr paul craig roberts just to back you up
[2:38:07.720 --> 2:38:12.600]  he said a month and a half ago when gold was at an all-time high of
[2:38:12.600 --> 2:38:15.480]  one thousand two hundred plus dollars he said
[2:38:15.480 --> 2:38:18.760]  look for the carry trade that's been reversed before it went to asia now it
[2:38:18.760 --> 2:38:23.640]  goes to america look for that to unwind in the new year
[2:38:23.640 --> 2:38:27.880]  in december into january and for a few months the dollar is going to go up
[2:38:27.880 --> 2:38:31.960]  then it's going to dive down again and that is coming to pass
[2:38:31.960 --> 2:38:36.040]  is that basically what you're saying jerald that's precisely it
[2:38:36.040 --> 2:38:39.560]  and again it's going to just a short time readjustment
[2:38:39.560 --> 2:38:42.520]  but the fact of the matter is and this is the point
[2:38:42.520 --> 2:38:45.480]  none of the currencies are worth the paper they're printed on
[2:38:45.480 --> 2:38:49.640]  the european central banks have been flooding the marketplace
[2:38:49.640 --> 2:38:52.840]  with cheap money and now they're starting to repatriate it
[2:38:52.840 --> 2:38:57.480]  here's the way the deal works a commercial bank goes to the central bank
[2:38:57.480 --> 2:39:03.320]  and they put up collateralized debt and then the central banks load of money
[2:39:03.320 --> 2:39:07.720]  on the collateral that they gave them the collateral isn't worth anything
[2:39:07.720 --> 2:39:13.800]  it's junk it's toxic assets it's due by value
[2:39:13.800 --> 2:39:17.880]  so now when they start repatriating there's nothing to
[2:39:17.880 --> 2:39:22.120]  there to repatriate in terms of unwinding their positions
[2:39:22.120 --> 2:39:25.400]  so the big collapse will happen we believe
[2:39:25.400 --> 2:39:30.360]  around spring time it happened again with the dot com crash around the same
[2:39:30.360 --> 2:39:32.920]  time we're looking for around the same time
[2:39:32.920 --> 2:39:36.360]  of unwinding this spring it can happen earlier
[2:39:36.360 --> 2:39:40.760]  because there are wild cars that no one can see and the wild car to keep
[2:39:40.760 --> 2:39:46.040]  watching is going to be terror terror is back in style
[2:39:46.040 --> 2:39:49.400]  look for their orange alerts the yellow alerts
[2:39:49.400 --> 2:39:52.920]  look for every kind of makeup alert that they can make up
[2:39:52.920 --> 2:39:56.680]  and not believe tana will be out there homeland security
[2:39:56.680 --> 2:40:02.360]  saying that the situation is under control i can't believe they came up
[2:40:02.360 --> 2:40:08.520]  with such an unbelievable character that's right and we also have all these
[2:40:08.520 --> 2:40:14.120]  different governments saying 300 suicide bombers on planes
[2:40:14.120 --> 2:40:19.160]  thousands of white al-qaeda the militias have linked up with al-qaeda
[2:40:19.160 --> 2:40:24.440]  now that clearly is staged and we got the mayac and homeland security reports
[2:40:24.440 --> 2:40:27.400]  that stated the real homeland security system
[2:40:27.400 --> 2:40:31.720]  is set up for veterans gun owners patriots the american people revolting
[2:40:31.720 --> 2:40:35.240]  against goldman sacks and jp morgan that have been robbing us
[2:40:35.240 --> 2:40:39.560]  can you speak to that to them trying to use the terror card against the american
[2:40:39.560 --> 2:40:43.560]  people and to what you see on the revolt end
[2:40:43.560 --> 2:40:47.480]  that you've said you've seen coming up in 2012
[2:40:47.480 --> 2:40:51.160]  we see the revolt really gaining steam because there's not going to be any
[2:40:51.160 --> 2:40:54.280]  recovery unemployment numbers are terrible
[2:40:54.280 --> 2:40:57.720]  and we know they're fudging the numbers and that's not this isn't made up by
[2:40:57.720 --> 2:41:02.840]  the way just look at the facts the third court of gdp reports 2009
[2:41:02.840 --> 2:41:06.680]  it came in 3.5 percent the stock market was
[2:41:06.680 --> 2:41:09.960]  oh jubilant they just rose and kept going higher
[2:41:09.960 --> 2:41:13.160]  oh then they readjusted well that wasn't 3.5
[2:41:13.160 --> 2:41:21.000]  it was 2.8 all right then they readjusted it one more once down to 2.2
[2:41:21.000 --> 2:41:24.760]  as you well know they're cooking the unemployment numbers as well
[2:41:24.760 --> 2:41:28.840]  the real unemployment rate with with long-term unemployed discouraged
[2:41:28.840 --> 2:41:33.720]  parts on we're looking at 20 percent when winter sets in remember you're going
[2:41:33.720 --> 2:41:39.000]  to start seeing a big increase in unemployment as the temporary jobs
[2:41:39.000 --> 2:41:42.120]  that were created during the holidays start to disappear
[2:41:42.120 --> 2:41:47.400]  and then look behind the numbers of what kind of jobs are being created
[2:41:47.400 --> 2:41:52.200]  hey you want a job in home health care how about a personal home health aid
[2:41:52.200 --> 2:41:56.360]  there's a job for eight dollars and 20 cents an hour waiting for you
[2:41:56.360 --> 2:42:01.480]  want to stock shelves at walmart's you have that four-year college degree
[2:42:01.480 --> 2:42:05.080]  let's put it to use well they already reported this is the worst christmas
[2:42:05.080 --> 2:42:10.280]  sales since 1979 well again this is what we're
[2:42:10.280 --> 2:42:13.320]  looking at the jobs that are being created
[2:42:13.320 --> 2:42:18.040]  even when they're pumping the numbers up the jobs aren't worth anything
[2:42:18.040 --> 2:42:21.400]  so we're going to and then oh by the way this is another big one
[2:42:21.400 --> 2:42:25.640]  all these kids with college degrees that their parents said that it could be
[2:42:25.640 --> 2:42:29.560]  anything they wanted to be they have nothing they're going
[2:42:29.560 --> 2:42:34.440]  nowhere it's a dead end so now you're putting all this together
[2:42:34.440 --> 2:42:39.480]  you're seeing the beginning of the second american revolution
[2:42:39.480 --> 2:42:43.800]  it's underway it happened with the tea parties the tax protest
[2:42:43.800 --> 2:42:48.360]  the fourth of july demonstrations the town hall meeting revolts
[2:42:48.360 --> 2:42:52.680]  the people going to march on washington against big government
[2:42:52.680 --> 2:42:56.360]  of course is being hijacked by different elements out there but
[2:42:56.360 --> 2:43:01.640]  nonetheless it's still moving forward so as we're looking at the economy going
[2:43:01.640 --> 2:43:04.920]  down we're looking at the religion the revolution
[2:43:04.920 --> 2:43:08.840]  going up and then we're looking at terrorism
[2:43:08.840 --> 2:43:13.960]  the government knows they're losing control when they lose control
[2:43:13.960 --> 2:43:18.440]  they tighten the screws and that's what we're going to see
[2:43:18.440 --> 2:43:22.840]  the screws are going to be tightened in the name of terror
[2:43:22.840 --> 2:43:26.760]  but how does that play out i mean i mean reading a trends forecaster which i
[2:43:26.760 --> 2:43:29.720]  really respect you're believing it's not gonna work
[2:43:29.720 --> 2:43:32.680]  it'll take a few years but by them showing their hand
[2:43:32.680 --> 2:43:36.200]  that this is the beginning of the end of this of this group of corporate
[2:43:36.200 --> 2:43:39.800]  criminals that's the way we look at it now
[2:43:39.800 --> 2:43:44.200]  however if the wild card goes as wild
[2:43:44.200 --> 2:43:50.360]  as starting a war with iran then all bets are off
[2:43:50.360 --> 2:43:55.800]  because they will keep us in the state of perpetual war
[2:43:55.800 --> 2:43:59.880]  look they're keeping us in war now even though
[2:43:59.880 --> 2:44:03.000]  we
[2:44:03.160 --> 2:44:08.680]  why we're in iraq are bogus we were told they were weapons of mass destruction
[2:44:08.680 --> 2:44:12.520]  we were told they were ties to al-qaeda and they weren't there
[2:44:12.520 --> 2:44:16.920]  we're still there so if there's a real war with iran
[2:44:16.920 --> 2:44:21.000]  a major war then our forecast changes and
[2:44:21.000 --> 2:44:25.080]  again we can't predict the wild card and again they just put out a new fake
[2:44:25.080 --> 2:44:28.600]  report saying iran had nukes that's now been proven to be
[2:44:28.600 --> 2:44:31.880]  fraudulent they're trying the same playbook gerald i want to go to calls
[2:44:31.880 --> 2:44:36.360]  here but i wanted to ask you this question i'm sure you saw the bloomberg
[2:44:36.360 --> 2:44:39.880]  article a few weeks ago where goldman sacks is arming
[2:44:39.880 --> 2:44:43.000]  its employees against the citizens and expect
[2:44:43.000 --> 2:44:47.240]  lynch mobs literally the villagers with pitchforks to come
[2:44:47.240 --> 2:44:50.200]  again there are criminals that have committed these crimes
[2:44:50.200 --> 2:44:53.720]  they can't believe that we're putting up with it they
[2:44:53.720 --> 2:44:56.840]  know they're criminal they know they've been bad
[2:44:56.840 --> 2:45:00.440]  how can you speak to that well look at listen to loy bank
[2:45:00.440 --> 2:45:03.480]  blank fine the head of the goldman sacks gang
[2:45:03.480 --> 2:45:07.880]  he has the nerve to say he's doing god's work i mean you know these people are
[2:45:07.880 --> 2:45:11.480]  delusional in a lot of ways yeah they know we're after the people are after
[2:45:11.480 --> 2:45:14.200]  them one of the trends we wrote about a year ago
[2:45:14.200 --> 2:45:17.560]  it was off with their heads we saw this coming
[2:45:17.560 --> 2:45:21.560]  yeah they know they're in trouble and so is by the way
[2:45:21.560 --> 2:45:26.200]  the whole government is in trouble they're so disconnected
[2:45:26.200 --> 2:45:29.400]  and of course they're exactly even the democrats
[2:45:29.400 --> 2:45:33.080]  on the grassroots even the chairman of the party is against this healthcare
[2:45:33.080 --> 2:45:36.680]  bill that raises your taxes and cuts your benefits
[2:45:36.680 --> 2:45:40.440]  for the insurance companies who wrote it the democrats have now read it and they
[2:45:40.440 --> 2:45:43.720]  don't care if republicans and democrats don't want it
[2:45:43.720 --> 2:45:48.440]  some polls as high as 75 against they're still gonna pass it
[2:45:48.440 --> 2:45:52.600]  and they did the same thing with talk they do the same thing with everything
[2:45:52.600 --> 2:45:56.600]  they cannot gauge the anger of the people
[2:45:56.600 --> 2:46:00.600]  because they are living privileged lives
[2:46:00.600 --> 2:46:05.560]  off with their heads came about because of the same reason
[2:46:05.560 --> 2:46:09.960]  let them eat cake give them a health insurance policy
[2:46:09.960 --> 2:46:13.320]  it's the same thing they don't have a clue
[2:46:13.320 --> 2:46:17.400]  of the anger and the real frustration because
[2:46:17.400 --> 2:46:21.720]  and i say this over and over again when people lose everything
[2:46:21.720 --> 2:46:26.760]  and they have nothing left to lose they lose it and they're going to start to
[2:46:26.760 --> 2:46:30.040]  lose it but if people are losing it and they
[2:46:30.040 --> 2:46:32.920]  start world war three and set up the draft which they've been
[2:46:32.920 --> 2:46:37.080]  getting ready for and run all these patriotic ads about al-qaeda
[2:46:37.080 --> 2:46:40.680]  hit us again today they blew up the washington monument last month
[2:46:40.680 --> 2:46:44.840]  you know we've got our rest your neighbors they were criticizing the war
[2:46:44.840 --> 2:46:48.040]  if if everybody knows the government's criminal and robbed them they're not
[2:46:48.040 --> 2:46:51.160]  going to buy this and it's going to blow up even worse if they
[2:46:51.160 --> 2:46:55.000]  start world war three not necessarily you know if people
[2:46:55.000 --> 2:46:59.080]  get very fearful but particularly the gutless
[2:46:59.080 --> 2:47:03.000]  and they i mean actually i mean people actually believe that george bush
[2:47:03.000 --> 2:47:07.560]  was going to come right in on the white horse and say that remember
[2:47:07.560 --> 2:47:11.320]  he was going to hunt down finland and bring him back dead or alive
[2:47:11.320 --> 2:47:15.240]  how can you get away with such a cheap trick so the point is you get away with
[2:47:15.240 --> 2:47:19.240]  a lot so if they bring this war to levels beyond what
[2:47:19.240 --> 2:47:23.080]  we could ever imagine they'll be in full control
[2:47:23.080 --> 2:47:27.080]  the flags will be waving the yellow ribbons will be out there
[2:47:27.080 --> 2:47:30.600]  and it'll be the same lines over and over again
[2:47:30.600 --> 2:47:35.880]  but the lines are so sophomoric i mean it's just
[2:47:35.880 --> 2:47:40.600]  again they believe george bush i mean how bad could you get if eight years of
[2:47:40.600 --> 2:47:45.640]  bush musolini would have been elected into office and they brought in obama
[2:47:45.640 --> 2:47:49.640]  they believe this song and dance i mean how could any it's it's the
[2:47:49.640 --> 2:47:53.640]  presidential reality show yeah he shoots great hoops
[2:47:53.640 --> 2:47:57.720]  and michelle does the hula hoop i mean how could you get more sophomoric than
[2:47:57.720 --> 2:48:01.720]  that and they'll give us some new idiot in
[2:48:01.720 --> 2:48:06.680]  three years some new fad well if we if we don't have a new
[2:48:06.680 --> 2:48:10.200]  third party but we're forecasting the emergence
[2:48:10.200 --> 2:48:16.760]  of a new third party in 2012 and then by the way i made my reputation part of
[2:48:16.760 --> 2:48:20.280]  it back in 1988 when i had predicted in one of my
[2:48:20.280 --> 2:48:23.960]  books trend tracking that there'd be a new third party and someone like ross
[2:48:23.960 --> 2:48:27.480]  perot would be that kind of person you ever said his name
[2:48:27.480 --> 2:48:30.680]  yeah i even wrote the name for some strange reason
[2:48:30.680 --> 2:48:34.520]  and and the same situation is available now
[2:48:34.520 --> 2:48:40.440]  and with the internet what we're doing right now is just the beginning and and
[2:48:40.440 --> 2:48:44.200]  it really starts to change now because of technology
[2:48:44.200 --> 2:48:48.920]  now you people only watch about two minutes on the small screen a day
[2:48:48.920 --> 2:48:52.120]  but they're watching six hours on the widescreen
[2:48:52.120 --> 2:48:56.200]  very soon it's now you could plug in from the small screen
[2:48:56.200 --> 2:49:00.200]  and have it broadcast widescreen we're going to see new
[2:49:00.200 --> 2:49:06.360]  news divisions new news networks new entertainment networks media based
[2:49:06.360 --> 2:49:09.720]  from the internet that's what fox news is already created
[2:49:09.720 --> 2:49:12.760]  sites that look like prison planet info wars and they admit they're trying to
[2:49:12.760 --> 2:49:17.640]  doppelgang what i do uh but but they're not you
[2:49:17.640 --> 2:49:21.160]  and they'll never be you you can't copy you but they're going to they were going
[2:49:21.160 --> 2:49:25.400]  to see new news people are going to tune into an internet
[2:49:25.400 --> 2:49:29.240]  candidate there are more independent i agree with you gerald and i'll take a
[2:49:29.240 --> 2:49:31.000]  few calls here but i'm going to ask you this
[2:49:31.000 --> 2:49:35.400]  they have the fake neocon has has they have hijacked
[2:49:35.400 --> 2:49:39.320]  the rebellion but if they ride the peaceful
[2:49:39.320 --> 2:49:43.160]  third party into a rat hole that will only make it explode even bigger the
[2:49:43.160 --> 2:49:47.560]  next year it may not happen because of the
[2:49:47.560 --> 2:49:51.800]  again there's so many wildcards what if we don't have net neutrality anymore
[2:49:51.800 --> 2:49:55.320]  then our forecasts are off and by the way australia
[2:49:55.320 --> 2:49:59.960]  is now trying to pass legislation that will put them in the same league as
[2:49:59.960 --> 2:50:03.640]  china so they say that they say it's
[2:50:03.640 --> 2:50:07.560]  chinese style that's their quote uh gerald we i'm skipping this break for
[2:50:07.560 --> 2:50:11.000]  stations it's a network break so we can skip it i want to talk to andrea
[2:50:11.000 --> 2:50:14.120]  frank wane josh and joe guys have your quick questions ready
[2:50:14.120 --> 2:50:18.360]  but i want to ask you any other quick trends for 2010
[2:50:18.360 --> 2:50:21.080]  and forward you want to drop on a sterile salenta
[2:50:21.080 --> 2:50:25.960]  survivalism and and it's not going to the hills with ak-47s
[2:50:25.960 --> 2:50:29.480]  or cans of pork and beans it's at every level
[2:50:29.480 --> 2:50:32.520]  be prepared for the worst you always could pull back from it
[2:50:32.520 --> 2:50:38.280]  i'm most concerned about terror 2010 the prospects of calling bank holidays not
[2:50:38.280 --> 2:50:43.720]  being able to get your money and having devalued
[2:50:43.720 --> 2:50:48.280]  absolutely let's take a call uh andrea in south carolina here on the air with
[2:50:48.280 --> 2:50:51.320]  gerald salenta the top trends forecaster go ahead
[2:50:51.320 --> 2:50:56.520]  it is certainly my andrea excuse me i'm reading way across the room go ahead
[2:50:56.520 --> 2:50:59.960]  i hear you man i wanted to thank you for waking me up four years ago member of
[2:50:59.960 --> 2:51:03.480]  9 11 truth my question is this when we look at this
[2:51:03.480 --> 2:51:07.720]  disgusting terror attack perpetrated false flag operation against the american
[2:51:07.720 --> 2:51:12.600]  people um can we look at the put options
[2:51:12.600 --> 2:51:16.280]  put on delta airlines because i checked the stocks last night
[2:51:16.280 --> 2:51:19.640]  and they've dropped off 25 percent at least
[2:51:19.640 --> 2:51:24.200]  so i think these people are so greedy that they bet against delta
[2:51:24.200 --> 2:51:28.440]  and that will give us their fingerprint what do you guys think
[2:51:28.440 --> 2:51:31.960]  well of course they're greedy they'll do anything they'll sell their mother
[2:51:31.960 --> 2:51:35.720]  and look what golden sacks does is they get you to buy things
[2:51:35.720 --> 2:51:39.800]  now that they're shorting so yeah i don't put anything past anybody
[2:51:39.800 --> 2:51:43.160]  absolutely i'm just hoping that if we can get that information out the actual
[2:51:43.160 --> 2:51:47.560]  people who are profiting from this attack that we can stir up the
[2:51:47.560 --> 2:51:50.440]  revolution that we need man we got to get these people out here thank you
[2:51:50.440 --> 2:51:54.440]  alex and thank you gerald thank you thank you sir i appreciate
[2:51:54.440 --> 2:51:57.240]  your call andrea i got to move that screen closer it's like
[2:51:57.240 --> 2:52:01.240]  way across the room um let's talk to frank in ohio
[2:52:01.240 --> 2:52:08.120]  frank are on the air hey god bless x non vet people are being too myopic
[2:52:08.120 --> 2:52:12.520]  and looking at stocks and things i want them to envision and put a map most
[2:52:12.520 --> 2:52:16.120]  people don't even realize the yamen is down at the south end of
[2:52:16.120 --> 2:52:19.880]  saudi arabia and i want people to understand
[2:52:19.880 --> 2:52:23.560]  that this is a new world order global race
[2:52:23.560 --> 2:52:29.560]  and bid for power and power over the peoples and lands of places like
[2:52:29.560 --> 2:52:34.920]  africa and well it's that key key port there right across from africa
[2:52:34.920 --> 2:52:38.840]  well it the bid to take over the areas
[2:52:38.840 --> 2:52:44.200]  the red sea the gulf the gulf of omen the arabian sea so this is
[2:52:44.200 --> 2:52:49.480]  divvying up what moscow and beijing must be laughing their backside off
[2:52:49.480 --> 2:52:53.320]  and and drink and toast as as our own congress
[2:52:53.320 --> 2:52:59.400]  and fbi and cia destroy and homeland security destroy constitutional
[2:52:59.400 --> 2:53:04.280]  rights and bill rights and just watch us just implode
[2:53:04.280 --> 2:53:09.320]  on ourselves like feeding frenzy on prana yeah we are totally discredited
[2:53:09.320 --> 2:53:12.760]  worldwide everybody tried to give us a break with obama now
[2:53:12.760 --> 2:53:16.280]  they're finding out he's even worse and they give him a peace prize to make it
[2:53:16.280 --> 2:53:20.040]  a joke now isn't this really the globalist setting america up as the
[2:53:20.040 --> 2:53:23.800]  bad guy gerol salenta well i i just spoke to a russian
[2:53:23.800 --> 2:53:27.240]  correspondent that uh... one of their
[2:53:27.240 --> 2:53:32.120]  colleagues attended the g-20 meeting in pittsburgh
[2:53:32.120 --> 2:53:36.840]  they were they could not believe the amount of police
[2:53:36.840 --> 2:53:41.800]  control going on it made them feel as though they lived in the most
[2:53:41.800 --> 2:53:47.080]  democratic society in the world compared to what they saw
[2:53:47.080 --> 2:53:50.680]  in pittsburgh this is coming from a russian
[2:53:50.680 --> 2:53:55.160]  so that's how bad it is though yeah they're testing our police they had cops
[2:53:55.160 --> 2:53:57.720]  looking for people outside during the day
[2:53:57.720 --> 2:54:01.000]  and old women would walk out with bags out of a shop
[2:54:01.000 --> 2:54:05.800]  and go officer i just bought something and they would release a dog on them
[2:54:05.800 --> 2:54:09.240]  i mean how did they turn the the cops into demons
[2:54:09.240 --> 2:54:13.240]  exactly this is what the russians are saying that it's where they can't believe
[2:54:13.240 --> 2:54:17.560]  this is happening in america now the other thing that frank mentioned is
[2:54:17.560 --> 2:54:21.400]  where yemen is bordering saudi arabia as we mentioned
[2:54:21.400 --> 2:54:25.880]  and that now they're also remember the coal
[2:54:25.880 --> 2:54:30.120]  the uss coal was blown up they got blown in aid yeah
[2:54:30.120 --> 2:54:36.760]  now 25 percent of the world's oil moves through the straits in that area
[2:54:36.760 --> 2:54:41.160]  so if we have a terrorist strike and again saudi arabia the u.s
[2:54:41.160 --> 2:54:46.200]  the yemen government are all involved in this there's a civil war going on there
[2:54:46.200 --> 2:54:50.840]  it's their second and 15 years rebellions in the north and the south
[2:54:50.840 --> 2:54:57.080]  religious tribal it's it's a mess and what's going what they're doing and
[2:54:57.080 --> 2:54:59.640]  there's absolutely no evidence even coming from the
[2:54:59.640 --> 2:55:03.400]  Saudis saying there's no evidence they're blaming it
[2:55:03.400 --> 2:55:09.240]  on Iran so put the pieces together
[2:55:09.240 --> 2:55:12.360]  i just wanted to point out if people put the map out
[2:55:12.360 --> 2:55:15.880]  and this power under the guise of terrorism
[2:55:15.880 --> 2:55:21.800]  watching our poor american and blessed american military boys and girls
[2:55:21.800 --> 2:55:25.560]  going into country without declaration to war we're going to
[2:55:25.560 --> 2:55:32.360]  take do a power grab in iraq and on the other side on afghanistan and then
[2:55:32.360 --> 2:55:38.120]  run into pakistan so we do see the the globalist
[2:55:38.120 --> 2:55:42.920]  uh in there dividing up and conquering and taking over and they got a fake
[2:55:42.920 --> 2:55:46.840]  leftist in there to sell the left on going along
[2:55:46.840 --> 2:55:52.840]  with a warmonger worse than george bush putting climate control and and
[2:55:52.840 --> 2:55:57.880]  taxes national taxes on that we can see how it's a power
[2:55:57.880 --> 2:56:03.320]  power grab from both the american industrialist
[2:56:03.320 --> 2:56:06.840]  and and using our boys and girls in military
[2:56:06.840 --> 2:56:11.160]  to do a power grab around the world and and and it's not that's exactly what's
[2:56:11.160 --> 2:56:14.280]  happening frank i appreciate your call and they think once they get us in
[2:56:14.280 --> 2:56:18.120]  these wars we'll be like yeah we gotta win the football game we can't cut and

[3:00:24.200 --> 3:00:28.840]  provocateur event or a patsy event whether this guy was a useful idiot
[3:00:28.840 --> 3:00:33.800]  disheveled drug brought through security you know that's a point i want to make
[3:00:33.800 --> 3:00:39.400]  here with uh michigander curt haskell with his wife
[3:00:39.400 --> 3:00:43.000]  coming back from an african safari coming through europe
[3:00:43.000 --> 3:00:48.440]  coming through hamster dam witnessing this guy be bypassing security with a
[3:00:48.440 --> 3:00:51.240]  sharp rest man i've seen that in the news days ago
[3:00:51.240 --> 3:00:54.360]  that they don't know how he bypassed regular security
[3:00:54.360 --> 3:00:58.280]  and so that proves your story how did he get through security but they won't
[3:00:58.280 --> 3:01:02.520]  release the footage so mr haskell you'll be back with us for 20 minutes
[3:01:02.520 --> 3:01:06.200]  with any new developments sunday in the new year on the third
[3:01:06.200 --> 3:01:10.200]  but right now uh in the last four minutes we've got with you
[3:01:10.200 --> 3:01:14.040]  recap all these different inconsistencies i mean there's been so many
[3:01:14.040 --> 3:01:17.880]  where the fbi has gone back and admitted they lied the question then is
[3:01:17.880 --> 3:01:21.240]  why no video why the line why the changing their stories
[3:01:21.240 --> 3:01:26.280]  your story never changed my story has never changed i've repeated it
[3:01:26.280 --> 3:01:29.880]  hundreds of times the people all over the world have never changed anything in
[3:01:29.880 --> 3:01:35.480]  my story um it from from the the first time i reported
[3:01:35.480 --> 3:01:39.080]  my story uh you know to a reporter i was talking
[3:01:39.080 --> 3:01:42.920]  about the second man that i saw hauled off after a dog
[3:01:42.920 --> 3:01:47.560]  found something in his carry-on bag um you know this was five days ago
[3:01:47.560 --> 3:01:51.720]  the fbi flat out denied it instead only one man
[3:01:51.720 --> 3:01:58.840]  was detained uh the terrorist man and uh you know i was glad to see i believe
[3:01:58.840 --> 3:02:02.040]  yesterday a couple of my fellow passengers came out and said
[3:02:02.040 --> 3:02:06.200]  yeah mr haskell is right and backed up what i said and then
[3:02:06.200 --> 3:02:11.160]  uh you know i harassed the fbi about it yesterday when they're in my office
[3:02:11.160 --> 3:02:14.200]  when they showed me a picture of what who i thought was
[3:02:14.200 --> 3:02:19.720]  indeed this man and uh amazingly last night the fbi story changed and now
[3:02:19.720 --> 3:02:24.280]  oh whoops there is a second man but uh
[3:02:24.280 --> 3:02:28.040]  he uh wasn't arrested he's just being held by custom
[3:02:28.040 --> 3:02:31.560]  indefinitely on some sort of immigration charge
[3:02:31.560 --> 3:02:37.640]  you know immigration charge being what he didn't have a passport either
[3:02:37.640 --> 3:02:40.680]  and they'd be a little more specific on what that is
[3:02:40.680 --> 3:02:46.520]  uh i haven't heard that yet um also shy pole airport security came out the
[3:02:46.520 --> 3:02:51.000]  other day and said uh the terrorist man
[3:02:51.000 --> 3:02:53.960]  did not have to go through normal passport checking
[3:02:53.960 --> 3:02:59.480]  procedures at the airport and uh now they come out today and said he did show
[3:02:59.480 --> 3:03:04.760]  his passport which post holes in my story according to them
[3:03:04.760 --> 3:03:10.600]  but uh those two statements aren't necessarily a odd with each other
[3:03:10.600 --> 3:03:14.200]  um he didn't go through normal passport checking procedures
[3:03:14.200 --> 3:03:17.640]  and he showed his passport but how do we not know that
[3:03:17.640 --> 3:03:21.560]  maybe he just didn't flash it to a security manager in a back room or
[3:03:21.560 --> 3:03:26.280]  something which would tie uh both their counts together as well as
[3:03:26.280 --> 3:03:31.400]  mine we don't know um and uh amazing that uh their
[3:03:31.400 --> 3:03:35.080]  saying he showed his passport now when the when the other day
[3:03:35.080 --> 3:03:38.840]  he didn't go through normal passport checking procedures by the way
[3:03:38.840 --> 3:03:43.560]  could they please define that what is the definition of not a normal
[3:03:43.560 --> 3:03:47.720]  passport checking procedure i would really like a very specific
[3:03:47.720 --> 3:03:51.320]  definition of that uh just a couple uh thoughts
[3:03:51.320 --> 3:03:57.080]  in my head today man they are certainly covering something up
[3:03:57.080 --> 3:04:01.320]  and there's no discussion in the media where is the footage
[3:04:01.320 --> 3:04:07.320]  of the man filming the entire flight and calmly filming the incident with the
[3:04:07.320 --> 3:04:14.280]  underwear bomber uh someone this is a said that he looked dazed or druged
[3:04:14.280 --> 3:04:17.320]  what do you what do you look like when you saw him brought through by the sharp
[3:04:17.320 --> 3:04:21.400]  dress man uh the best way i could describe him would be
[3:04:21.400 --> 3:04:24.040]  emotionless
[3:04:26.200 --> 3:04:31.400]  so he was zombie like um
[3:04:31.480 --> 3:04:35.960]  you know zombie like to me is a definition uh that would
[3:04:35.960 --> 3:04:40.840]  entail you know uh blurry or clear unclear eyes and i can't really verify
[3:04:40.840 --> 3:04:44.040]  that he was just blank he was blank i would say
[3:04:44.040 --> 3:04:46.920]  emotionless it's the best way that i could describe him
[3:04:46.920 --> 3:04:51.240]  all right we'll talk to you again sunday we appreciate your courage
[3:04:51.240 --> 3:04:55.560]  curt haskell from michigan a survivor of the underwear bombing attack
[3:04:55.560 --> 3:04:59.560]  hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone

[3:13:03.160 --> 3:13:07.080]  i wanted to get you on about the dollar i'll and all this is happening but
[3:13:07.080 --> 3:13:11.560]  i would imagine first off wane madson with your expertise on intelligence in
[3:13:11.560 --> 3:13:15.160]  false flag you'll probably want to discuss
[3:13:15.160 --> 3:13:18.120]  uh... the underwear bomber first or am i wrong
[3:13:18.120 --> 3:13:21.640]  no that's that's the item of the day i think uh... this is
[3:13:21.640 --> 3:13:25.960]  this is clearly a uh... a false flag operation if there ever
[3:13:25.960 --> 3:13:30.440]  was one it's got all the components of one and now we see the counterclaims
[3:13:30.440 --> 3:13:35.000]  the counter propaganda coming out of the usual suspects where i witness
[3:13:35.000 --> 3:13:39.320]  accounts are now being uh... but basically they're they're being uh...
[3:13:39.320 --> 3:13:43.000]  attacked uh... the two lawyers the the haskels
[3:13:43.000 --> 3:13:46.840]  uh... from michigan uh... it never it's being sent now that uh...
[3:13:46.840 --> 3:13:50.920]  this week along with the attempted underwear bomber was traveling
[3:13:50.920 --> 3:13:55.480]  with the passport uh... but he didn't show a passport when he boarded the
[3:13:55.480 --> 3:13:59.640]  flight and and uh... this well-dressed indian gentlemen
[3:13:59.640 --> 3:14:04.200]  uh... that arranged for him to get on the flight parading as a guest of the
[3:14:04.200 --> 3:14:07.880]  sudanese refugee i'm being told by my intelligence
[3:14:07.880 --> 3:14:11.240]  sources in asia that that guy is probably
[3:14:11.240 --> 3:14:14.360]  uh... indian research and analysis wing agent
[3:14:14.360 --> 3:14:18.200]  r a w is the indian version of our cia
[3:14:18.200 --> 3:14:21.160]  and that this was an operation uh... conducted
[3:14:21.160 --> 3:14:27.400]  jointly by r a w uh... most odd and the cia
[3:14:27.400 --> 3:14:32.760]  now it just came out in the british bbc london telegraph last week
[3:14:32.760 --> 3:14:38.120]  that yes it's true what indian intelligence said in moon by
[3:14:38.120 --> 3:14:42.680]  a year ago was true that british u.s and israeli intelligence was running
[3:14:42.680 --> 3:14:46.760]  commandos killing people they then shot a few patsies dressed him up
[3:14:46.760 --> 3:14:51.400]  shot one guy up full of lsd and that's the patsy but he himself
[3:14:51.400 --> 3:14:56.120]  is u.s intelligence same thing with mohammed atta and springman the head of
[3:14:56.120 --> 3:15:01.160]  the uh... embassy before nine eleven being told let the hijackers in
[3:15:01.160 --> 3:15:06.440]  their terror designation as a cia cover we see this over and over and over again
[3:15:06.440 --> 3:15:11.080]  wane uh... and and we have the indian man on the plane
[3:15:11.080 --> 3:15:15.320]  videotaping the entire flight trained on the underwear bomber
[3:15:15.320 --> 3:15:18.760]  the the feds don't want to say where that footage is
[3:15:18.760 --> 3:15:22.920]  uh... i interviewed haskell two days in a row haskell was on
[3:15:22.920 --> 3:15:27.080]  uh... at detroit and i want your take on this
[3:15:27.080 --> 3:15:33.080]  inside uh... of the customs area being searched a dog alerted
[3:15:33.080 --> 3:15:38.520]  on another indian man's bag uh... they took him behind closed doors and you've
[3:15:38.520 --> 3:15:41.000]  got to get out of here for your safety bomb
[3:15:41.000 --> 3:15:44.360]  they all get out of there now other witnesses have come forward on tv and
[3:15:44.360 --> 3:15:48.680]  said no that did happen and so the feds have suddenly recanted and said okay
[3:15:48.680 --> 3:15:53.080]  we did detain somebody else i mean this is this blew up in their face
[3:15:53.080 --> 3:15:56.680]  didn't it wane absolutely you know it reminds me of the
[3:15:56.680 --> 3:16:00.840]  uh... fort hood uh... shooter we were told that there were some other people
[3:16:00.840 --> 3:16:04.040]  arrested there and then we were told they were arrested and this is the same
[3:16:04.040 --> 3:16:05.640]  type of thing and it happens
[3:16:05.640 --> 3:16:09.240]  every time look at it you can take this kind of stuff back to the
[3:16:09.240 --> 3:16:13.240]  daily plaza in nineteen sixty three because in dalas there were other
[3:16:13.240 --> 3:16:17.160]  people arrested uh... in connection with the assassination of
[3:16:17.160 --> 3:16:20.280]  president kennedy and then they just simply disappeared
[3:16:20.280 --> 3:16:23.400]  you know and then the fb i says you didn't see anything
[3:16:23.400 --> 3:16:26.680]  no you're wrong and and you know this is what we're starting to hear out of the
[3:16:26.680 --> 3:16:27.720]  typical
[3:16:27.720 --> 3:16:31.880]  neoconservative media about the the household that they were somehow
[3:16:31.880 --> 3:16:35.800]  mistaken well i mean you can't be mistaken about things like this
[3:16:35.800 --> 3:16:39.480]  i would also know if there's some very strange information coming out about
[3:16:39.480 --> 3:16:43.880]  jasper shoringa remember he's the he's the young dutch guy who got his andy
[3:16:43.880 --> 3:16:45.960]  warhol 15 minutes of pain
[3:16:45.960 --> 3:16:48.040]  who supposedly you know he wrestled
[3:16:48.040 --> 3:16:51.720]  move to lop up uh... you know down and prevented him from
[3:16:51.720 --> 3:16:53.880]  detonating his underwear blowing up
[3:16:53.880 --> 3:16:58.440]  hole in the fuselage of the airplane but it turns out that uh... shoringa
[3:16:58.440 --> 3:17:04.360]  uh... is that the person who drove him to the uh... airport a guy named chris
[3:17:04.360 --> 3:17:08.280]  bonhammersport he drove in the airport on christmas morning
[3:17:08.280 --> 3:17:13.240]  ish people left as one of his friends on his facebook page
[3:17:13.240 --> 3:17:19.480]  the amir of dubai shake uh... rashi bin mack in my tomb
[3:17:19.480 --> 3:17:20.680]  um...
[3:17:20.680 --> 3:17:24.040]  and uh... now we know that there was another report
[3:17:24.040 --> 3:17:27.640]  uh... that uh... dollar airlines uh... passenger
[3:17:27.640 --> 3:17:31.480]  uh... attempted to board uh... uh... uh... a plane and located issue
[3:17:31.480 --> 3:17:35.560]  last month with a syringe powder and liquid
[3:17:35.560 --> 3:17:39.160]  was that it was not allowed to afford that flight
[3:17:39.160 --> 3:17:43.960]  uh... i would point out that dollar airlines is owned by dupai world
[3:17:43.960 --> 3:17:45.880]  that the company that's owned by the
[3:17:45.880 --> 3:17:50.680]  amir of dupai shake mohammed bin rashi down my tomb who just so happened to be
[3:17:50.680 --> 3:17:53.000]  uh... listed as a friend on
[3:17:53.000 --> 3:17:57.000]  uh... shoringa's a friend of bonhammersport facebook page
[3:17:57.000 --> 3:17:59.720]  i mean this is what intelligence agents
[3:17:59.720 --> 3:18:02.440]  agency should be looking at these connections
[3:18:02.440 --> 3:18:05.720]  uh... but i'm sure the word is out don't go after
[3:18:05.720 --> 3:18:09.960]  any fall flag operation i thought it was interesting that president obama
[3:18:09.960 --> 3:18:14.360]  never mentioned in his initial comments never meant mention al-qaeda
[3:18:14.360 --> 3:18:16.120]  but i'm sure you know it'll be
[3:18:16.120 --> 3:18:17.560]  broken too soon where
[3:18:17.560 --> 3:18:21.240]  it'll be like george bush and will start hearing the same old al-qaeda refrain
[3:18:21.240 --> 3:18:25.400]  over and over again yeah i i mean i'm no defender of obama but looking at this
[3:18:25.400 --> 3:18:28.600]  and i want your expert take on this way in madsen
[3:18:28.600 --> 3:18:31.640]  it appears this is probably a neocon job
[3:18:31.640 --> 3:18:36.520]  in the rogue networks even outside of obama but tied into the israeli angle
[3:18:36.520 --> 3:18:40.600]  because the way they're pressuring obama saying he's got to get tough
[3:18:40.600 --> 3:18:45.000]  he's got to get tough on the war on terror and the left saying oh look he is tough
[3:18:45.000 --> 3:18:49.880]  as we have co-opting the left into politically supporting more wars
[3:18:49.880 --> 3:18:53.080]  uh... this whole thing is tailored to sell the body scanners
[3:18:53.080 --> 3:18:56.040]  the police state kind of as a way to buttress
[3:18:56.040 --> 3:18:59.640]  uh... the entire agenda and a way to uh...
[3:18:59.640 --> 3:19:03.160]  kind of push obama supporters and into
[3:19:03.160 --> 3:19:06.280]  into taking on a neocon coloration
[3:19:06.280 --> 3:19:09.240]  why i'm a little bit sick because this comes right after
[3:19:09.240 --> 3:19:13.640]  uh... we we have another forgery these iran nuclear weapons documents turns out
[3:19:13.640 --> 3:19:17.960]  that that was a forge forgery uh... and and now we have something
[3:19:17.960 --> 3:19:21.080]  uh... again it looks like another forgery that uh...
[3:19:21.080 --> 3:19:24.680]  uh... uh... the cabinet these premia tall of iran
[3:19:24.680 --> 3:19:28.040]  uh... some something that was supposedly backed
[3:19:28.040 --> 3:19:33.240]  out of iran says that he's got plans to leave iran with his family and flee to
[3:19:33.240 --> 3:19:36.680]  russia i mean these are the times of the
[3:19:36.680 --> 3:19:40.200]  pony documents the flag operations
[3:19:40.200 --> 3:19:44.200]  and all kinds of false information exactly wane madsen stay there because
[3:19:44.200 --> 3:19:46.600]  we have the preparation for war with the emin
[3:19:46.600 --> 3:19:50.200]  the massing of troops all the hype then this happens
[3:19:50.200 --> 3:19:56.280]  right on time and now israel's saying they may hit iran
[3:19:56.280 --> 3:20:02.680]  our economy is in great distress the financial dominoes can fall at any time
[3:20:02.680 --> 3:20:08.200]  it's time to stop hoping it doesn't happen and prepare just in case it does
[3:20:08.200 --> 3:20:14.040]  you have auto and home insurance why wouldn't you have food insurance
[3:20:14.040 --> 3:20:17.400]  are you prepared to feed your family long term
[3:20:17.400 --> 3:20:21.160]  because it might take years to recover as the adult

[3:21:10.440 --> 3:21:14.840]  on our president in congress and they really are calling the shots i think

[3:24:06.200 --> 3:24:12.920]  what they want us to do is keep on forcing them by 30 days
[3:24:12.920 --> 3:24:20.440]  no one try day i was driving to the local store to get some eggs
[3:24:20.440 --> 3:24:24.200]  christmas afternoon and i heard about the
[3:24:24.200 --> 3:24:27.400]  underwear bomber and it just fit the mo of all the other
[3:24:27.400 --> 3:24:31.080]  fake attacks in every case they usher them on the plane security does
[3:24:31.080 --> 3:24:33.960]  they're always mentally ill they always look like children or like they're out
[3:24:33.960 --> 3:24:37.640]  of their minds i look at the photos of the underwear bomber
[3:24:37.640 --> 3:24:41.880]  he looks like he's about 14 years old is clearly a mental deficient
[3:24:41.880 --> 3:24:46.840]  it's always the same and then now you have the fbi caught lying about
[3:24:46.840 --> 3:24:50.040]  everything and you have the preparation to go into yemen
[3:24:50.040 --> 3:24:55.080]  into sudan into somalia all the new hype i mean we said the obama deception
[3:24:55.080 --> 3:24:58.440]  out six and a half months ago seven months ago
[3:24:58.440 --> 3:25:01.880]  that look for staged events to get us into africa
[3:25:01.880 --> 3:25:05.480]  going back to wane madson again national security expert wane madson
[3:25:05.480 --> 3:25:09.080]  report dot com uh... wane
[3:25:09.080 --> 3:25:14.040]  getting into all the other evidence of this being a false flag
[3:25:15.240 --> 3:25:19.720]  with a very odd connection let's let's look at this guy's father the
[3:25:19.720 --> 3:25:23.160]  underwear bomber's father he is one of the top
[3:25:23.160 --> 3:25:27.880]  banking officials tied to the top government officials of nigeria
[3:25:27.880 --> 3:25:34.440]  umaru mutilab he uh... we do know now that he reported that his son
[3:25:34.440 --> 3:25:38.920]  was traveling with a passport but not a nigerian passport
[3:25:38.920 --> 3:25:43.800]  but a but an italian passport i just i just found out that
[3:25:43.800 --> 3:25:48.040]  uh... the elder mutilab the banker happens to hold
[3:25:48.040 --> 3:25:53.160]  the order of merit from italy so he obviously has very close connection to
[3:25:53.160 --> 3:25:56.760]  the italian government that's soviet burlesque only
[3:25:56.760 --> 3:26:00.200]  the italians have been caught i don't know how many times as fascist
[3:26:00.200 --> 3:26:03.000]  government in italy burlesque only government has been caught several
[3:26:03.000 --> 3:26:06.760]  times involved in all kinds of false flag operations
[3:26:06.760 --> 3:26:10.840]  uh... including two other former presidents come out and declassify
[3:26:10.840 --> 3:26:14.520]  that they staged hundreds of bombings namely the balonia bombing
[3:26:14.520 --> 3:26:17.960]  right and we also know that uh... what where did the niger
[3:26:17.960 --> 3:26:21.880]  uh... yellow cake phony yellow cake uranium documents come out of the
[3:26:21.880 --> 3:26:27.320]  cake they were laundered through italy uh... uh... by uh... media operations
[3:26:27.320 --> 3:26:31.240]  controlled by burlesque only so when you've got an italian connection you've
[3:26:31.240 --> 3:26:34.360]  got uh... obvious israeli connections you got now
[3:26:34.360 --> 3:26:39.080]  connections to india which is uh... a partner with the cia and mozad and
[3:26:39.080 --> 3:26:42.280]  various false flag operations including their fingerprints
[3:26:42.280 --> 3:26:45.000]  as you mentioned are all over the Mumbai attack
[3:26:45.000 --> 3:26:48.280]  now being impressed is reporting what i originally reported that
[3:26:48.280 --> 3:26:52.840]  the Mumbai attacks were a false flag operation uh... that now the guy who
[3:26:52.840 --> 3:26:55.240]  was accused of that is recanting fake
[3:26:55.240 --> 3:27:00.520]  his confession was forced though uh... we do live in a wilderness of mirrors
[3:27:00.520 --> 3:27:01.640]  we don't know
[3:27:01.640 --> 3:27:04.200]  really what's what's real and what is it real
[3:27:04.200 --> 3:27:07.560]  and it just uh... i think it's incumbent on everyone
[3:27:07.560 --> 3:27:11.960]  do a little bit at deeper digging on these stories and not listen to these
[3:27:11.960 --> 3:27:14.680]  these uh... globiating people on the
[3:27:14.680 --> 3:27:18.040]  these uh... talking head network to go on and on and on
[3:27:18.040 --> 3:27:19.480]  with this uh... this
[3:27:19.480 --> 3:27:23.560]  this business about this is al-qaeda two point oh this is
[3:27:23.560 --> 3:27:27.400]  you know what i mean it's key bono they want to move into africa and uh...
[3:27:27.400 --> 3:27:29.880]  southern uh... middle east and southern al
[3:27:29.880 --> 3:27:32.600]  doing this that was their agenda with african
[3:27:32.600 --> 3:27:36.600]  and the rest of it and uh... speaking of italy key bono
[3:27:36.600 --> 3:27:39.880]  who benefits that's what you always follow the money of the power and you
[3:27:39.880 --> 3:27:41.880]  always find out who did it
[3:27:41.880 --> 3:27:46.360]  that's right and and and obviously we we have this proxy war in yemen right now
[3:27:46.360 --> 3:27:50.600]  between the she is in the northern part of the country that with the who he
[3:27:50.600 --> 3:27:51.800]  wrecked revels
[3:27:51.800 --> 3:27:54.680]  uh... are basically supported by iran
[3:27:54.680 --> 3:27:57.800]  and the eminy government which is supported by
[3:27:57.800 --> 3:28:00.200]  uh... uh... you know here we go again
[3:28:00.200 --> 3:28:03.240]  al-ya'rabia israel in the united states
[3:28:03.240 --> 3:28:06.600]  uh... we we saw this happen in the past with
[3:28:06.600 --> 3:28:08.600]  these strange alliances when
[3:28:08.600 --> 3:28:11.320]  but i'm saying launch this cut missiles
[3:28:11.320 --> 3:28:15.160]  not only at israel but also with al-ya'rabia he's all those
[3:28:15.160 --> 3:28:19.160]  two countries being included with what we saw in the eighties massage the saudi
[3:28:19.160 --> 3:28:21.960]  arabians the egyptians in the united states
[3:28:21.960 --> 3:28:25.800]  as well as the italians and others helping out to go after the russians
[3:28:25.800 --> 3:28:28.440]  it's always the same groups teaming up
[3:28:28.440 --> 3:28:32.280]  where it goes back to look at that group of intelligence agencies from
[3:28:32.280 --> 3:28:35.640]  formed back in the sixties called the safari club and that
[3:28:35.640 --> 3:28:39.560]  that included uh... the church and we know there's all kinds of
[3:28:39.560 --> 3:28:42.920]  uh... all kinds of information out coming out of turkey about an
[3:28:42.920 --> 3:28:47.720]  attempt by uh... the nato backed uh... armed forces to overthrow the turkish
[3:28:47.720 --> 3:28:48.600]  government
[3:28:48.600 --> 3:28:52.680]  of prime minister erdoğan has been a very big critic of what's been going on
[3:28:52.680 --> 3:28:57.400]  in gaza uh... uh... is that there's this group called organic on which is
[3:28:57.400 --> 3:29:02.200]  basically uh... uh... uh... uh... gladio type uh... operation the gladio of
[3:29:02.200 --> 3:29:03.160]  course was
[3:29:03.160 --> 3:29:06.840]  uh... stay behind that work that was formed by the c i a in an event of a
[3:29:06.840 --> 3:29:09.880]  soviet invasion of europe turkey and other countries
[3:29:09.880 --> 3:29:14.120]  uh... uh... this group by organic on it's been linked to the israelis
[3:29:14.120 --> 3:29:17.240]  uh... that they were conducting all flag operations
[3:29:17.240 --> 3:29:19.360]  and blaming them on the current
[3:29:19.360 --> 3:29:22.600]  uh... the pkk and and and turkey so
[3:29:22.600 --> 3:29:26.600]  uh... we have this part of the world uh... the middle east
[3:29:26.600 --> 3:29:29.480]  that is nothing but all five operations

[3:33:45.320 --> 3:33:49.560]  never hear again on specific articles specific news
[3:33:49.560 --> 3:33:53.880]  specific items but we do have guests who come back every month
[3:33:53.880 --> 3:33:59.400]  i don't know we got 30 40 of them and they're people who are consistently
[3:33:59.400 --> 3:34:02.600]  proven right in hindsight that's what i respect
[3:34:02.600 --> 3:34:06.840]  and that's who i want to associate with mentally
[3:34:06.840 --> 3:34:10.440]  i want to hear what they have to say i want to bounce information off them
[3:34:10.440 --> 3:34:14.680]  i want to brainstorm i want the truth it's not about left and right
[3:34:14.680 --> 3:34:18.440]  it's about the truth it's about right and wrong
[3:34:18.440 --> 3:34:22.680]  and it's hard to find the truth in this world the the controllers the social
[3:34:22.680 --> 3:34:26.520]  engineers have made it towards very hard to find the truth
[3:34:26.520 --> 3:34:30.440]  and what i want is the truth does that mean i have the truth no
[3:34:30.440 --> 3:34:33.640]  but this radio show is a lot closer to the truth
[3:34:33.640 --> 3:34:38.120]  than anything else you're going to find out there i challenge you
[3:34:38.120 --> 3:34:42.200]  and we don't in-fight we don't co-intel pro we don't fall for all the globalist
[3:34:42.200 --> 3:34:46.280]  tricks we don't get into racial issues or
[3:34:46.280 --> 3:34:49.480]  religious fighting we don't get into all these
[3:34:49.480 --> 3:34:53.640]  distractions we just cover the global power structure and what their agenda
[3:34:53.640 --> 3:34:58.440]  is and then you make a decision about what you're going to do about it
[3:34:58.440 --> 3:35:02.040]  we do have suggestions we do have issues we talk about we have people on we
[3:35:02.040 --> 3:35:07.880]  don't even totally agree with we want those different perspectives
[3:35:07.880 --> 3:35:12.840]  i may not agree with someone about how they want to see the world
[3:35:12.840 --> 3:35:15.560]  the direction they want to see the world go in but if they've been accurate in
[3:35:15.560 --> 3:35:20.680]  the past about predictions and analysis i want to still get their perspective
[3:35:20.680 --> 3:35:23.720]  going back to wane madson uh finishing up wane
[3:35:23.720 --> 3:35:27.720]  anything on the false flag what this heralds all the talk about
[3:35:27.720 --> 3:35:31.640]  now israel's saying we may go ahead and hit them the u.s is coming in with quote
[3:35:31.640 --> 3:35:35.640]  jerusalem post headline crippling sanctions ron paul
[3:35:35.640 --> 3:35:39.560]  rightfully calls this an act of war how would we like having our
[3:35:39.560 --> 3:35:43.240]  you know our supplies cut off here our our economy destroyed
[3:35:43.240 --> 3:35:47.080]  uh this empire just ladles out abuse and then
[3:35:47.080 --> 3:35:51.000]  if i ran even dare criticize their evil doesn't mean i'm in love with the
[3:35:51.000 --> 3:35:54.920]  corrupt system over there it's just that what our empire is doing is wrong
[3:35:54.920 --> 3:35:58.680]  your take on that and what you see in the new year then i want to get into
[3:35:58.680 --> 3:36:02.600]  health care the democrats finally finding out what's really in it
[3:36:02.600 --> 3:36:07.320]  uh where you see obama's future what kind of false flag you see in the new
[3:36:07.320 --> 3:36:10.360]  year wane madson one of the one thing that really
[3:36:10.360 --> 3:36:14.520]  amazes me is after nine eleven we were told all we need to have this
[3:36:14.520 --> 3:36:18.760]  uh... revamped the intelligence community information not being shared
[3:36:18.760 --> 3:36:24.120]  between the c i a any f b i any n s a and all these various
[3:36:24.120 --> 3:36:28.280]  three-letter alphabet suit agencies and now what are we being told
[3:36:28.280 --> 3:36:32.200]  the same thing information wasn't being shared i mean
[3:36:32.200 --> 3:36:36.040]  oh well i they must be thinking we're a bunch of fools to accept this
[3:36:36.040 --> 3:36:40.440]  uh... this explanation for why these things happen
[3:36:40.440 --> 3:36:44.360]  they want more power every time they take more of our rights and then
[3:36:44.360 --> 3:36:47.960]  they get even more power and now we've got to be prisoners on the plane and not
[3:36:47.960 --> 3:36:51.400]  having anything on our laps and not go to the bathroom and be body scan and
[3:36:51.400 --> 3:36:55.400]  that won't be enough now they want shocker bracelets sorry go ahead
[3:36:55.400 --> 3:36:59.160]  well i you know you mentioned uh... mike springman who reported what happened
[3:36:59.160 --> 3:37:03.880]  when he was uh... the visa uh... officer at the u s uh...
[3:37:03.880 --> 3:37:06.840]  uh... embassy in Saudi arabia howdy
[3:37:06.840 --> 3:37:10.840]  these parties known to be terrorist were given if you basically but uh... he
[3:37:10.840 --> 3:37:14.120]  was being ordered by the c i to give me the center of the country
[3:37:14.120 --> 3:37:18.760]  now we know that at the u s embassy in abuja the capital of nigeria
[3:37:18.760 --> 3:37:22.840]  this mutual ops father this wealthy guy who counts the president of nigeria
[3:37:22.840 --> 3:37:24.600]  amongst his friends
[3:37:24.600 --> 3:37:28.440]  uh... visited uh... with the uh... c i a station chief
[3:37:28.440 --> 3:37:32.120]  at the embassy in abuja said hey my son's acting pretty weird he's starting
[3:37:32.120 --> 3:37:35.800]  to start to talk about some pretty radical things apparently he was in an
[3:37:35.800 --> 3:37:37.320]  mba program
[3:37:37.320 --> 3:37:40.120]  in Dubai he dropped out of the program
[3:37:40.120 --> 3:37:44.120]  just uh... switched off his cell phone and destroyed his sim card
[3:37:44.120 --> 3:37:47.200]  uh... and um... uh... i mean
[3:37:47.200 --> 3:37:52.320]  but to buy it is is really uh... that the president the president has a blank
[3:37:52.320 --> 3:37:53.960]  if you remember the movie
[3:37:53.960 --> 3:37:55.360]  without people bar
[3:37:55.360 --> 3:37:59.360]  but the stock and trade for to buy other than dealing in it
[3:37:59.360 --> 3:38:02.720]  muggle uh... uh... items like diamonds golden
[3:38:02.720 --> 3:38:05.540]  and uh... a nuclear component apparently
[3:38:05.540 --> 3:38:07.340]  intelligence gathering
[3:38:07.340 --> 3:38:11.240]  uh... now we have this guy in Dubai remember who was at the american
[3:38:11.240 --> 3:38:15.200]  hospital in Dubai in july right before them you know couple months before nine
[3:38:15.200 --> 3:38:16.920]  eleven some of it a lot of it
[3:38:16.920 --> 3:38:19.160]  a lot of great he's there in the course that
[3:38:19.160 --> 3:38:22.640]  you know we've got the same thing the french report at that and they don't you
[3:38:22.640 --> 3:38:24.880]  know that was mistaken though there's no
[3:38:24.880 --> 3:38:28.920]  there's no c i age and no no no belong none of the word divide
[3:38:28.920 --> 3:38:30.860]  now we have this guy in Dubai
[3:38:30.860 --> 3:38:35.840]  uh... uh... where would where was all the u s intelligence agents
[3:38:35.840 --> 3:38:37.720]  who's toward that city
[3:38:37.720 --> 3:38:42.160]  uh... with the same report the father gave to the c i a station chief in a
[3:38:42.160 --> 3:38:44.080]  budget it did not happen
[3:38:44.080 --> 3:38:45.680]  we're being told now that
[3:38:45.680 --> 3:38:50.360]  uh... the embassy in in a budget that what's called a visa biker cable to the
[3:38:50.360 --> 3:38:52.360]  state department saying hey we had this
[3:38:52.360 --> 3:38:56.080]  guy come in this uh... prominent nigerian business man he's worried about
[3:38:56.080 --> 3:38:58.520]  his son who who uh... was on the
[3:38:58.520 --> 3:39:02.360]  uh... terrorist watch list but we're told he wasn't on the no-fly list
[3:39:02.360 --> 3:39:05.560]  uh... and that now we're getting the same thing we heard about
[3:39:05.560 --> 3:39:07.240]  you know prior to nine eleven
[3:39:07.240 --> 3:39:11.120]  all of the state department one of the ones to make the call to put them on a
[3:39:11.120 --> 3:39:14.440]  no-fly list that with the national counter terrorism and we're getting the
[3:39:14.440 --> 3:39:17.600]  same thing that we got a month and a half ago with the
[3:39:17.600 --> 3:39:19.040]  with the fort hutch shooter
[3:39:19.040 --> 3:39:22.640]  where he for years he's talking about what he's going to do supposedly
[3:39:22.640 --> 3:39:26.000]  to al qaeda and it's the same cleric that runs everybody
[3:39:26.000 --> 3:39:29.380]  and he's really emailing the c i a the whole time and they stand out
[3:39:29.380 --> 3:39:33.160]  and everybody sees other shooters and guns going off in the never ends
[3:39:33.160 --> 3:39:37.280]  right now i was supposedly in yemen and now this guy was this time with a lot
[3:39:37.280 --> 3:39:38.360]  with the polly
[3:39:38.360 --> 3:39:40.180]  includes with the guy in yemen
[3:39:40.180 --> 3:39:43.160]  are we supposedly that killed the guy with that
[3:39:43.160 --> 3:39:46.960]  uh... with a uh... a missile strike and now they're saying no we'd be never
[3:39:46.960 --> 3:39:50.240]  he never would be at the army recruiting center with the guy from yemen
[3:39:50.240 --> 3:39:52.200]  blasting people in arkansas
[3:39:52.200 --> 3:39:56.080]  exactly i mean that that this is just that i think this is a wilderness of
[3:39:56.080 --> 3:39:57.320]  mirrors uh...
[3:39:57.320 --> 3:40:00.640]  we can't believe anything about what these people say and
[3:40:00.640 --> 3:40:03.920]  and i you know i can't emphasize with obama so what because
[3:40:03.920 --> 3:40:06.920]  even though he's the president can you imagine the kind of
[3:40:06.920 --> 3:40:09.720]  you know just total garbage he's getting from these
[3:40:09.720 --> 3:40:14.040]  these jerks on a daily basis i mean he's got this guy john brennan of it
[3:40:14.040 --> 3:40:17.820]  as a national security uh... advisor uh... deputy national
[3:40:17.820 --> 3:40:22.880]  your advisor on terrorism it was brennan who his people were right link to obama's
[3:40:22.880 --> 3:40:24.320]  passport
[3:40:24.320 --> 3:40:27.680]  at the state department part of you know during the election campaign
[3:40:27.680 --> 3:40:31.000]  i mean he did it though clearly he is a kept man
[3:40:31.000 --> 3:40:34.520]  reading off a teleprompter surrounded by a nexus
[3:40:34.520 --> 3:40:38.760]  of intelligence agencies driving the entire policy of our country
[3:40:38.760 --> 3:40:41.120]  we are a captured nation
[3:40:41.120 --> 3:40:44.880]  absolutely and i i i i i've reported i believe that obama
[3:40:44.880 --> 3:40:48.920]  has his own past with the central intelligence agency especially when he
[3:40:48.920 --> 3:40:53.200]  was traveling uh... on an indonesian passport of the name barry to toro to
[3:40:53.200 --> 3:40:54.280]  pakistan
[3:40:54.280 --> 3:40:55.640]  at the same time is
[3:40:55.640 --> 3:40:59.360]  his professor at columbia's big yet presently with uh...
[3:40:59.360 --> 3:41:02.960]  uh... basically building up the anti-soviet muja had been that's right
[3:41:02.960 --> 3:41:06.320]  he's got an absolute spook pedigree
[3:41:06.320 --> 3:41:09.200]  absolutely i do you know you heard about military gratifying
[3:41:09.200 --> 3:41:12.680]  i'm beginning to call this guy a lonely brat because i think it's it's quite
[3:41:12.680 --> 3:41:13.560]  clear is
[3:41:13.560 --> 3:41:18.480]  his mother uh... was working up for the agency uh... recover for foundation
[3:41:18.480 --> 3:41:20.720]  that young barack was working for them
[3:41:20.720 --> 3:41:24.160]  they they of course his mom and dad met at a russian language class at the
[3:41:24.160 --> 3:41:25.720]  university of hawaii
[3:41:25.720 --> 3:41:28.840]  in nineteen sixty remember this is at the height of the cold
[3:41:28.840 --> 3:41:29.520]  war
[3:41:29.520 --> 3:41:32.040]  uh... russian language class
[3:41:32.040 --> 3:41:33.440]  exactly
[3:41:33.440 --> 3:41:36.200]  and then he goes back to product of back to kenya
[3:41:36.200 --> 3:41:39.600]  uh... he's actually brought over on a kennedy uh... foundation
[3:41:39.600 --> 3:41:44.000]  uh... grant and and this is at a time when the u.s. was actively recruiting
[3:41:44.000 --> 3:41:47.520]  uh... people because all these colonies were getting their independence
[3:41:47.520 --> 3:41:50.680]  uh... in africa especially the english-speaking colonies
[3:41:50.680 --> 3:41:54.400]  we and the british were recruiting people they call them the renaissance
[3:41:54.400 --> 3:41:55.720]  generation of
[3:41:55.720 --> 3:41:59.800]  african leaders barack obama senior was one of these individuals many others
[3:41:59.800 --> 3:42:00.880]  went to britain
[3:42:00.880 --> 3:42:03.760]  where they were recruited into the m i think we're going to the time we've got
[3:42:03.760 --> 3:42:06.440]  left talking for ten hours and i gotta go soon
[3:42:06.440 --> 3:42:08.160]  the time we've got left
[3:42:08.160 --> 3:42:11.760]  what does this signal then for foreign policy clearly
[3:42:11.760 --> 3:42:13.320]  just from a layman's perspective
[3:42:13.320 --> 3:42:15.120]  we're seeing a whole new
[3:42:15.120 --> 3:42:18.720]  kickoff like we saw at the start of nine eleven i mean this has all the
[3:42:18.720 --> 3:42:21.360]  makings that they're getting ready to go to a whole new level
[3:42:21.360 --> 3:42:23.200]  and that more false flags
[3:42:23.200 --> 3:42:26.080]  bigger false flags are in the pipeline
[3:42:26.080 --> 3:42:30.320]  well i think so and then you mentioned how this is going to affect our travel
[3:42:30.320 --> 3:42:34.360]  uh... that they obviously know the ski pole airport is announced uh... it's
[3:42:34.360 --> 3:42:35.880]  going to be mandatory for it
[3:42:35.880 --> 3:42:39.720]  all you have found passengers go through these millimeter wave detections
[3:42:39.720 --> 3:42:42.800]  they can actually look under your clothing in the images basically of
[3:42:42.800 --> 3:42:44.120]  your naked body
[3:42:44.120 --> 3:42:46.680]  uh... now i see this peter king this
[3:42:46.680 --> 3:42:48.480]  this uh... really horrible
[3:42:48.480 --> 3:42:51.880]  uh... congressman from long island he's the ranking republican on the
[3:42:51.880 --> 3:42:53.800]  homeland security uh... committee
[3:42:53.800 --> 3:42:57.680]  i'd be saying well you know uh... you gotta give you gotta give up on some
[3:42:57.680 --> 3:43:01.640]  privacy and in this day and age i would note that peter king isn't
[3:43:01.640 --> 3:43:05.560]  ardent supporter every time the catholic church gets hammered on pedophilia
[3:43:05.560 --> 3:43:07.320]  what your kids are going to have to go
[3:43:07.320 --> 3:43:09.160]  everyone could have to go through this
[3:43:09.160 --> 3:43:10.400]  darn thing right
[3:43:10.400 --> 3:43:11.640]  i mean can you imagine
[3:43:11.640 --> 3:43:16.120]  uh... kind of perverts that'll be uh... looming uh... and try to make a
[3:43:16.120 --> 3:43:21.000]  submit to them in fact i've read that it's really a biometric three sixty scan
[3:43:21.000 --> 3:43:24.280]  they've been used for a passive millimeter wave readers
[3:43:24.280 --> 3:43:27.840]  and that that's the secret technology they say the pentagon is using
[3:43:27.840 --> 3:43:31.560]  uh... in bob woodward's book and then i went and looked at the real data it's
[3:43:31.560 --> 3:43:32.560]  actually true
[3:43:32.560 --> 3:43:36.000]  they get a three sixty scan your body where they can now track everywhere you
[3:43:36.000 --> 3:43:37.920]  go even through your clothes
[3:43:37.920 --> 3:43:39.480]  right and i mean that
[3:43:39.480 --> 3:43:43.040]  and it's just as near thought of you know putting putting people through
[3:43:43.040 --> 3:43:44.080]  this type of
[3:43:44.080 --> 3:43:46.320]  i mean you might want to take your clothes off now
[3:43:46.320 --> 3:43:48.160]  here's the other thing that i see coming
[3:43:48.160 --> 3:43:52.320]  you know there's going to be in it uh... an ability to capture those videos too
[3:43:52.320 --> 3:43:54.720]  can you imagine when this stuff starts to appear
[3:43:54.720 --> 3:43:58.240]  uh... you know we always see the paparazzi photos can you imagine everything
[3:43:58.240 --> 3:44:02.320]  gets leaked i mean everything gets released and so they're going to release
[3:44:02.320 --> 3:44:06.480]  they're going to release wayne madson alex jones they can all laugh at our
[3:44:06.480 --> 3:44:09.320]  at our johnson size it'll be real fun
[3:44:09.320 --> 3:44:12.400]  well and and and the other thing of course you know you got perverts like
[3:44:12.400 --> 3:44:13.560]  peter king of
[3:44:13.560 --> 3:44:15.240]  who supports the you know
[3:44:15.240 --> 3:44:18.720]  the the the church every time uh... it you know it's a hammered
[3:44:18.720 --> 3:44:20.280]  for for pedophilia
[3:44:20.280 --> 3:44:23.520]  uh... you know i mean i can imagine this guy getting his own
[3:44:23.520 --> 3:44:27.920]  uh... you know uh... the pipeline of uh... captured images from
[3:44:27.920 --> 3:44:30.760]  from national airport here in washington uh...
[3:44:30.760 --> 3:44:35.640]  you know i mean it is that this is this is just a bit of perversion
[3:44:35.640 --> 3:44:38.160]  at a very grand scale and uh...
[3:44:38.160 --> 3:44:40.360]  and and obviously this was a good one
[3:44:40.360 --> 3:44:44.200]  i also would point out that the company that had the security both
[3:44:44.200 --> 3:44:48.520]  in in amsterdam which people in that at at charles the goal where the
[3:44:48.520 --> 3:44:50.840]  uh... richard read the shoe bomber boarded
[3:44:50.840 --> 3:44:55.080]  with the same chemical issues of this guy had a bad under short
[3:44:55.080 --> 3:44:56.880]  uh... if i see pia
[3:44:56.880 --> 3:45:00.360]  who makes up the leadership uh... of my cps
[3:45:00.360 --> 3:45:02.760]  ex-israeli mosa official
[3:45:02.760 --> 3:45:07.240]  and you mean you may even use the host country explosive instead of going and
[3:45:07.240 --> 3:45:09.960]  getting their enemies explosives they're that open
[3:45:09.960 --> 3:45:11.560]  right and and and the thing is
[3:45:11.560 --> 3:45:15.240]  well now who do you find on the board of directors of i cps
[3:45:15.240 --> 3:45:18.520]  norman menetta the trip transportation secretary
[3:45:18.520 --> 3:45:21.120]  uh... during nine eleven
[3:45:21.120 --> 3:45:24.520]  it just gets more insane by the millisecond uh... shifting years when
[3:45:24.520 --> 3:45:25.640]  madsen
[3:45:25.640 --> 3:45:29.000]  health care all these different democrats howard dean everybody are
[3:45:29.000 --> 3:45:29.880]  admitting
[3:45:29.880 --> 3:45:32.280]  you read the health care bill it's a giant
[3:45:32.280 --> 3:45:33.520]  ripoff
[3:45:33.520 --> 3:45:36.400]  to the insurance companies in the banks that own them
[3:45:36.400 --> 3:45:40.480]  it raises taxes cuts health care
[3:45:40.480 --> 3:45:44.360]  different senators are having thirty plus drops in their polls going into their
[3:45:44.360 --> 3:45:45.480]  elections
[3:45:45.480 --> 3:45:48.800]  this the democrats know this is suicide
[3:45:48.800 --> 3:45:52.400]  will get a bunch of neocons will suddenly forget how much they didn't like
[3:45:52.400 --> 3:45:54.920]  health care soon as they get in watch
[3:45:54.920 --> 3:45:56.760]  i mean this is a disaster
[3:45:56.760 --> 3:45:59.200]  uh... and why are the democrats doing this
[3:45:59.200 --> 3:46:01.480]  is it because they're being blackmailed
[3:46:01.480 --> 3:46:04.920]  well i think part of it is that in the other part of the democratic party when
[3:46:04.920 --> 3:46:08.440]  it all is said and done is really under the control of democratic leadership
[3:46:08.440 --> 3:46:09.320]  council
[3:46:09.320 --> 3:46:10.840]  these are the big pocketed
[3:46:10.840 --> 3:46:12.440]  uh... money people that
[3:46:12.440 --> 3:46:13.320]  decided
[3:46:13.320 --> 3:46:17.040]  you know what let's get the democrats on our side just like you know we've got
[3:46:17.040 --> 3:46:18.760]  the republicans lined up
[3:46:18.760 --> 3:46:22.520]  uh... so it doesn't matter who the president is we always get you know
[3:46:22.520 --> 3:46:24.560]  see that our agenda is advanced
[3:46:24.560 --> 3:46:28.520]  and uh... you know who were the deal see the deal here people like
[3:46:28.520 --> 3:46:31.600]  uh... uh... rama manuel the chief of staff
[3:46:31.600 --> 3:46:34.320]  and i think it's very interesting you know his brother
[3:46:34.320 --> 3:46:37.640]  a manual was brought in from the national institute of health to be an
[3:46:37.640 --> 3:46:38.600]  advisor
[3:46:38.600 --> 3:46:40.960]  on health care policy at the white house
[3:46:40.960 --> 3:46:44.200]  and he's given speeches calling for health rationing
[3:46:44.200 --> 3:46:47.960]  all right and and you know we i i think you need to ensure a fire dog like it
[3:46:47.960 --> 3:46:50.000]  seemed up with robert norquist
[3:46:50.000 --> 3:46:53.320]  uh... to demand an investigation rama manuel for what
[3:46:53.320 --> 3:46:56.700]  kind of stout dougary he was engaged with when he was appointed by it
[3:46:56.700 --> 3:46:59.960]  president clinton to the board of uh... pretty mac and we know about what
[3:46:59.960 --> 3:47:01.560]  happened a pretty mac later
[3:47:01.560 --> 3:47:03.720]  uh... i would also like to see
[3:47:03.720 --> 3:47:05.800]  people uh... team up uh... like
[3:47:05.800 --> 3:47:07.960]  like the left and right it came up on
[3:47:07.960 --> 3:47:12.600]  on wrong and pretty mac on on the role of the commodity well-played and coming
[3:47:12.600 --> 3:47:14.440]  up with this uh... this
[3:47:14.440 --> 3:47:18.400]  health care uh... fiasco because i think they
[3:47:18.400 --> 3:47:22.160]  uh... this is only a a boom dog over the insurance companies i would also put
[3:47:22.160 --> 3:47:23.600]  in their big pharma
[3:47:23.600 --> 3:47:26.720]  big farm is going to make out like uh... bandit
[3:47:26.720 --> 3:47:30.920]  with this program will take the banking bill bloomberg's reporting over four
[3:47:30.920 --> 3:47:34.120]  trillion in other goodies for the banks in that
[3:47:34.120 --> 3:47:37.600]  i mean they're acting like this country isn't going to exist anymore they
[3:47:37.600 --> 3:47:39.520]  they are just stealing
[3:47:39.520 --> 3:47:42.080]  with both hands both feet
[3:47:42.080 --> 3:47:43.800]  uh... i mean what i mean
[3:47:43.800 --> 3:47:49.040]  wane am i right in saying that government has just gone hog wild crazy
[3:47:49.040 --> 3:47:53.080]  we are not you know obama promise change i would point out that that
[3:47:53.080 --> 3:47:54.000]  that there was a
[3:47:54.000 --> 3:47:56.320]  there's been a demonstration at the
[3:47:56.320 --> 3:47:58.820]  war pool plan in evansville indiana
[3:47:58.820 --> 3:48:02.800]  uh... there but that company's moving it factory to mexico a thousand people
[3:48:02.800 --> 3:48:04.320]  go lose your job
[3:48:04.320 --> 3:48:07.120]  uh... in indiana and evansville at this point
[3:48:07.120 --> 3:48:11.200]  why is obama talking about stimulus money when he could have picked up the
[3:48:11.200 --> 3:48:13.320]  phone to the chairman of world war two
[3:48:13.320 --> 3:48:16.000]  you will go to Mexico at your own risk
[3:48:16.000 --> 3:48:17.200]  i will pack
[3:48:17.200 --> 3:48:21.520]  uh... that the bg's is out of you four billion of the gmail out went to move
[3:48:21.520 --> 3:48:26.360]  the factory's ish in europe china and brazil and you can't make this up
[3:48:26.360 --> 3:48:29.080]  right and you know indiana went for the world
[3:48:29.080 --> 3:48:31.000]  for obama the first time
[3:48:31.000 --> 3:48:34.520]  they voted democratic and sixty-four for linden johnson but
[3:48:34.520 --> 3:48:39.640]  i doubt i i i really feel that what i'm hearing more and more is that obama is
[3:48:39.640 --> 3:48:40.800]  going to be facing
[3:48:40.800 --> 3:48:44.520]  at least one if not two primary challengers and twelve
[3:48:44.520 --> 3:48:47.760]  and and and very soon we're going to be people started
[3:48:47.760 --> 3:48:52.320]  around in the iowa uh... in iowa first caucus
[3:48:52.320 --> 3:48:53.680]  and attend the you know the
[3:48:53.680 --> 3:48:55.000]  teachers meetings and
[3:48:55.000 --> 3:49:00.200]  and and and you know that that's what i see i see absolute devastation in the
[3:49:00.200 --> 3:49:01.360]  next election
[3:49:01.360 --> 3:49:04.400]  and the next election after that the big national election
[3:49:04.400 --> 3:49:08.000]  total annihilation of the democrats but then what happens
[3:49:08.000 --> 3:49:11.600]  the republicans will even have a shorter honeymoon they'll keep stealing is
[3:49:11.600 --> 3:49:15.360]  that when the revolution comes is when we put the republicans in and they even
[3:49:15.360 --> 3:49:18.760]  are worse than obama is that when people finally wake up
[3:49:18.760 --> 3:49:22.560]  well i think i think that two thousand twelve and maybe ten i'm not sure about
[3:49:22.560 --> 3:49:24.880]  ten because it's congressional election but
[3:49:24.880 --> 3:49:29.440]  in twelve i think we may be one of those rare times where a third party
[3:49:29.440 --> 3:49:32.880]  candidate could come on very strong we call that ninety two
[3:49:32.880 --> 3:49:34.240]  with ross perot
[3:49:34.240 --> 3:49:37.720]  uh... you know everyone was discussed it with old man bush and
[3:49:37.720 --> 3:49:39.280]  they didn't quite truck that trust
[3:49:39.280 --> 3:49:40.880]  political and let's face it
[3:49:40.880 --> 3:49:43.360]  and for good reason we found out later why
[3:49:43.360 --> 3:49:46.480]  but uh... i think it's one of those rare times when we see
[3:49:46.480 --> 3:49:49.200]  a third party potential game
[3:49:49.200 --> 3:49:52.800]  and i really believe whether it's you know jetty ventura that then it could
[3:49:52.800 --> 3:49:53.800]  penetrate
[3:49:53.800 --> 3:49:56.640]  any of these people i think we're going to see a third party
[3:49:56.640 --> 3:50:00.240]  challenger i think the third party challenger is going to potentially do very
[3:50:00.240 --> 3:50:01.000]  well
[3:50:01.000 --> 3:50:02.800]  and and and put the threat to the
[3:50:02.800 --> 3:50:08.360]  ruling uh... duopoly of the democrats and republicans
[3:50:08.360 --> 3:50:12.680]  whatever happens we're in for a wild ride will talk to lane madson again in

[3:50:27.320 --> 3:50:28.520]  to say
[3:50:28.520 --> 3:50:29.560]  pun intended
[3:50:29.560 --> 3:50:33.000]  that the underwear bombing plot blew up in their face and
[3:50:33.000 --> 3:50:35.640]  that it's really uh... not going well for them
[3:50:35.640 --> 3:50:39.040]  well i remember that when we had the richard read the shoe bomber we all had
[3:50:39.040 --> 3:50:42.320]  to take off her shoes i don't know what that means now that we all have to take
[3:50:42.320 --> 3:50:44.480]  off her underwear when we bought a plane
[3:50:44.480 --> 3:50:47.880]  yeah that's the message we're gonna body scan you next is the tazer bracelet

[3:54:26.240 --> 3:54:30.960]  but i want to do a tribute to george washington
[3:54:30.960 --> 3:54:35.600]  coming up in the last hour near the end of the show today because
[3:54:35.600 --> 3:54:40.000]  we need to remember who the real john wane is and we need to know
[3:54:40.000 --> 3:54:43.360]  that our enemies are fully aware of who george washington is
[3:54:43.360 --> 3:54:46.560]  that's why you never hear about him nothing about george washington is
[3:54:46.560 --> 3:54:52.640]  taught uh i'll tell you it was even it was even
[3:54:52.640 --> 3:54:56.800]  batter as they coronally talk about somebody who's tough stuff
[3:54:56.800 --> 3:55:03.520]  is andrew jackson but george washington was the real deal
[3:55:03.520 --> 3:55:07.920]  true americana and to praise him is like
[3:55:07.920 --> 3:55:12.880]  iron claws across a chalkboard
[3:55:12.880 --> 3:55:18.240]  it sends our enemies into fits of rage
[3:55:18.240 --> 3:55:21.360]  and last time i was reading quotes by george washington
[3:55:21.360 --> 3:55:25.440]  it would be better that the entire continent be drenched in blood
[3:55:25.440 --> 3:55:29.520]  than we live in tyranny as slaves
[3:55:29.520 --> 3:55:35.120]  oh it's so radical no it's not we're not gonna be your slaves new world order
[3:55:35.120 --> 3:55:38.480]  and the biggest thing with this terrorism is we're being caught to
[3:55:38.480 --> 3:55:43.200]  nanny and be afraid and see men in uniforms marching around as our gods
[3:55:43.200 --> 3:55:47.280]  as our saviors with their m16s meanwhile the terrorists are being
[3:55:47.280 --> 3:55:51.120]  escorted on board the planes by security
[3:55:51.760 --> 3:55:57.200]  all of this the troops being put on the streets all of it is for you
[3:55:57.200 --> 3:56:03.760]  george washington knew it you need to know it i stand with george washington
[3:56:03.760 --> 3:56:09.120]  i stand with the founding fathers not with the truly archaic tyranny
[3:56:09.120 --> 3:56:13.600]  they were the true revolutionaries of liberty and freedom george washington
[3:56:13.600 --> 3:56:16.560]  handed over his power when they wanted him to be king
[3:56:16.560 --> 3:56:20.160]  he was they said we want you to be king a sizable group after they beat the
[3:56:20.160 --> 3:56:24.160]  british wanted to be king the british wanted to make a deal with him to make
[3:56:24.160 --> 3:56:27.360]  him king and that's why king george the third when he
[3:56:27.360 --> 3:56:32.560]  heard that george washington refused it said quote george washington is the
[3:56:32.560 --> 3:56:36.640]  greatest man in the world because nobody ever turned down
[3:56:36.640 --> 3:56:43.840]  power like that george washington's the real deal
[3:56:43.840 --> 3:56:47.840]  that's why the new world order didn't like him
[3:56:47.840 --> 3:56:51.520]  they don't want you to have models of true leadership true heroes
[3:56:51.520 --> 3:56:56.000]  they want you to think it's some stupid football player or golfer
[3:56:56.000 --> 3:56:59.920]  or even a hollywood person who cares at the end of the day
[3:56:59.920 --> 3:57:03.200]  it's what people do what they stand up for
[3:57:03.200 --> 3:57:06.240]  doesn't mean you're perfect doesn't mean you don't have you that you have all
