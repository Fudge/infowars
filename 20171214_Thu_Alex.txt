[00:40.120 --> 00:46.520]  coming up the third hour open phones starting in the first hour but I got to
[00:46.520 --> 00:52.320]  tell you we played some of the big highlights of the congressional hearings
[00:52.320 --> 00:58.640]  yesterday about the criminal activity of the Clinton stay-behind network inside
[00:58.640 --> 01:03.800]  the Justice Department trying to frame the president to steal and overturn the
[01:03.800 --> 01:13.440]  2016 election but this thing went on all day and so we weren't able to watch all
[01:13.440 --> 01:19.320]  of it we played some bombshell clips then last night in this morning I found
[01:19.320 --> 01:25.080]  more clips and the crew bought more clips to my attention that are unbelievable
[01:25.080 --> 01:30.880]  because if Congressman Jordan Jim Jordan and if Congressman Trey Gowdy said
[01:30.880 --> 01:34.560]  the things they said last week they knew were coming out they came out this
[01:34.560 --> 01:39.720]  week they then foreshadowed what's gonna happen next week and that is the
[01:39.720 --> 01:46.600]  resignation of Andrew McCabe the head of the FBI because he's in the emails that
[01:46.600 --> 01:49.760]  they held off to the night before the hearing they held him off till Tuesday
[01:49.760 --> 01:53.440]  night then of course they had the hearings yesterday on Wednesday where
[01:53.440 --> 01:59.000]  he's in the meeting quarter backing how to bring down Trump during the election
[01:59.000 --> 02:04.640]  and saying don't panic we're going to defeat him and then they run the whole
[02:04.640 --> 02:09.960]  fake fusion GPS deal and they got the Justice Department paying millions to
[02:09.960 --> 02:14.800]  the wife of the head of the Justice Department Russia unit I mean total
[02:14.800 --> 02:22.520]  collusion it'd be like the judge the jury and the prosecutor in your trial all
[02:22.520 --> 02:29.000]  being a father a wife the judge is the father the prosecutors the wife and then
[02:29.000 --> 02:33.880]  they've got 11 children and they're the jury you'd say recuse yourself conflict
[02:33.880 --> 02:39.520]  of interest it doesn't this is as bad as Hitler sitting in judgment of the Nazis
[02:39.520 --> 02:48.800]  in Nuremberg I mean this is whoa this is so over-the-top arrogant belligerent
[02:48.800 --> 02:55.960]  hubris filled Hutzpah filled bravada filled the arrogance the the recklessness
[02:55.960 --> 03:03.240]  the fake confidence that criminals and scum and betas engage in when when
[03:03.240 --> 03:07.000]  beta is finally getting a man's world and get together as a group of betas and
[03:07.000 --> 03:11.320]  start engaging in criminal activity they just do things alphas would never do I
[03:11.320 --> 03:16.520]  just I keep learning that it's betas who are the ones that get together and
[03:16.520 --> 03:21.080]  commit the really big crimes and they're all about your chicken neck
[03:21.080 --> 03:25.000]  anti-american trash I mean you read their emails their text I mean these are
[03:25.000 --> 03:29.560]  people that have a big giant you know what for America and just hate flyover
[03:29.560 --> 03:35.000]  country and hate bitter clingers and hate Christians and just hate everything I
[03:35.000 --> 03:40.320]  mean this is a group of garbage but you've got to be garbage if people are
[03:40.320 --> 03:44.640]  in your business which is our country robbing it they're gonna hate the people
[03:44.640 --> 03:48.600]  they're robbing it's what criminals do they always demonize who they're robbing
[03:48.600 --> 03:56.280]  and they always think they're invincible until they get caught robbing and then
[03:56.280 --> 04:01.280]  they think threats and intimidation and garbage work on people who are alphas
[04:01.280 --> 04:06.360]  because they're betas and it would work on them well it doesn't work on Trump it
[04:06.360 --> 04:11.280]  doesn't work on America and it doesn't work on me make up whatever you want do

[06:25.240 --> 06:42.560]  ladies and gentlemen former prosecutor congressional insider Trey Gowdy said
[06:42.560 --> 06:48.520]  he'll be surprised if FBI director McCabe hasn't resigned by next week over the
[06:48.520 --> 06:51.640]  new emails that they've been forced to turn over that they tried to keep from
[06:51.640 --> 06:56.840]  Congress totally violating the hatchback fighting violating federal law
[06:56.840 --> 07:02.880]  flagrantly but it gets worse you've got the FBI giving millions of dollars with
[07:02.880 --> 07:08.920]  McCabe directing it behind the scenes during the campaign against Trump in
[07:08.920 --> 07:13.320]  emails and text messages saying don't worry we're gonna stop Trump and we're
[07:13.320 --> 07:17.680]  gonna fund fusion GPS then the Justice Department head that's over that program
[07:17.680 --> 07:23.040]  gives millions of dollars to his wife the head of those operations at fusion
[07:23.040 --> 07:29.480]  GPS the judge is involved and had to recuse themselves I mean this is
[07:29.480 --> 07:37.080]  unbelievable this was a Clinton cadre or a strike force inside the Justice
[07:37.080 --> 07:42.840]  Department the same ones that with a cleanup crew for them on uranium one the
[07:42.840 --> 07:48.920]  servers the foundation the thousands of kids coming up missing hundreds and
[07:48.920 --> 07:54.240]  Haiti I mean this is incredible and it's all breaking and it's all confirmed and
[07:54.240 --> 08:02.000]  it's all criminal so ladies and gentlemen this is huge and very very
[08:02.000 --> 08:08.760]  positive we're gonna play that clip of Trey Gowdy yesterday in the bombshell
[08:08.760 --> 08:13.880]  hearings and again Trey Gowdy and Congressman Jordan all foreshadowed
[08:13.880 --> 08:16.640]  last week what would come out this week because they've already got the
[08:16.640 --> 08:20.840]  documents okay they've got a high-level security clearances they're just making
[08:20.840 --> 08:26.840]  the Justice Department and the FBI turn it over or wait to see if they lie
[08:26.840 --> 08:30.560]  about it they got it all they got the whole thing hell we had the whole thing
[08:30.560 --> 08:37.480]  six months ago I mean a year ago we knew about the operation so Trump's just been
[08:37.480 --> 08:41.000]  giving them rope giving them rope giving them rope giving them rope here's the
[08:41.000 --> 08:46.400]  big problem though this is on news wars.com. Assange, Trump being sucked
[08:46.400 --> 08:50.200]  dry before installation of President Pence same thing Drudge has been saying
[08:50.200 --> 08:55.040]  with all their amazing contacts and it's not that Pence himself is bad they're
[08:55.040 --> 08:59.040]  keeping him separated as you always do so that if anything happens the
[08:59.040 --> 09:02.000]  president you've got politically the vice president but they're using that
[09:02.000 --> 09:05.960]  insulation to basically prepare him for that so that's a serious situation that's
[09:05.960 --> 09:09.760]  coming up we've got even bigger news on the North Korea situation and the
[09:09.760 --> 09:13.360]  Russian president saying the US is in danger of a major war we've got some
[09:13.360 --> 09:18.680]  statements from Putin coming up but first ladies and gentlemen here it is
[09:18.680 --> 09:24.880]  here is Trey Gowdy with this amazing statement. I hate it for Rod Rosenstein
[09:24.880 --> 09:28.440]  that he's the one explaining it because he's not Peter Strzok and he's not
[09:28.440 --> 09:32.600]  Andy McCabe and he's not Jim Comey so he's having to do a little bit of cleanup
[09:32.600 --> 09:37.760]  but but these are really bad facts if you care about an impartial objective
[09:37.760 --> 09:43.160]  Department of Justice and FBI. I want to go to the other part of the text
[09:43.160 --> 09:47.440]  messages that goes to this question of conspiracy because as Ed Henry laid out
[09:47.440 --> 09:52.000]  the timeline all on all of this is very problematic this is a text message from
[09:52.000 --> 09:56.840]  Lisa from Peter Strzok to Lisa Page I want to believe the path you threw out
[09:56.840 --> 10:01.320]  for consideration in Andy's office that there's no way he gets elected but I'm
[10:01.320 --> 10:06.480]  afraid we can't take that risk it's like an insurance policy in the unlikely
[10:06.480 --> 10:11.000]  event that you die before you're 40 now you know obviously everyone's gonna try
[10:11.000 --> 10:15.000]  to figure out what he was gonna do to make sure that you couldn't take that
[10:15.000 --> 10:19.240]  risk but it would help everyone to understand that at the time that he
[10:19.240 --> 10:22.800]  said that he was investigating Hillary Clinton to decide whether or not they
[10:22.800 --> 10:27.120]  were gonna pursue charges against her. Yes ma'am I'm still trying to figure out
[10:27.120 --> 10:31.760]  why three FBI agents are discussing politics in the deputy director's office
[10:31.760 --> 10:36.040]  because you're not supposed to discuss politics on on federal ground and FBI
[10:36.040 --> 10:39.800]  agents aren't supposed to engage in politics for Hatch Act reasons remember
[10:39.800 --> 10:43.400]  we were supposed to interview Andy McCabe yesterday on another committee it
[10:43.400 --> 10:47.640]  was all set up and ready to go and then at the last minute they said ah he can't
[10:47.640 --> 10:51.840]  come Tuesday he's gonna come next week I'll be shocked if he comes next week I
[10:51.840 --> 10:55.800]  I'll be a little bit surprised if he's still an employee of the FBI this time
[10:55.800 --> 11:02.120]  next week but the notion that three bureau agents would be conspiring or
[11:02.120 --> 11:07.480]  plotting on how to handle the outcome of a presidential election is the opposite
[11:07.480 --> 11:12.120]  of what you want in an objective, dispassionate, criminal conspiracy because they
[11:12.120 --> 11:17.560]  use taxpayer money to further buy and embellish and polish the turd that was
[11:17.560 --> 11:22.680]  the fusion GPS and then money went to the head just department official over all
[11:22.680 --> 11:28.880]  Russian operations to his wife who was heading the operation infusion GPS how
[11:28.880 --> 11:33.360]  much money did she get they're saying it looks like she's paid a half million a
[11:33.360 --> 11:38.560]  year how do you know how lazy these people are to produce one fake report
[11:38.560 --> 11:45.480]  about people peeing on folks I mean that's the laziness of this scum here's
[11:45.480 --> 11:50.440]  a half million dollars lady just make a report about a made-up event here give
[11:50.440 --> 11:54.040]  me a half million a Trump was in a room with a bunch of hippopotamus is a
[11:54.040 --> 11:59.480]  crap dawning and there were Kebler elves there watching and they videotaped the
[11:59.480 --> 12:03.880]  whole thing there were naked monkeys swinging from chandeliers I mean it's
[12:03.880 --> 12:09.520]  not true and they admit it's a fraud these people are insane and I've got a
[12:09.520 --> 12:14.000]  bunch of other clips we're gonna get to here but it just gets crazier and crazier
[12:14.000 --> 12:18.880]  I like this clip Democrat representative says everybody our favorite Democrat
[12:18.880 --> 12:25.840]  to call for me to be censored live three weeks ago in Congress wiggly and of
[12:25.840 --> 12:29.200]  course also mr. Cohen made similar comments that he's he actually worked
[12:29.200 --> 12:33.960]  to get the Jesse Ventura show canceled and then openly talked about it and so
[12:33.960 --> 12:37.400]  there's no such thing as FEMA camps or plans to target conservatives a member
[12:37.400 --> 12:43.200]  congressman Cohen of Tennessee so so we're gonna go to this clip where they're
[12:43.200 --> 12:49.760]  talking about this and they say everybody respects Mueller and then
[12:49.760 --> 12:55.800]  Gomer pops in from Texas I don't because you can't speak for everybody see
[12:55.800 --> 13:01.120]  everybody was Mueller has been a dirty FBI agent from the beginning that's why
[13:01.120 --> 13:06.480]  he's been put in charge of things because he is a horrible evil person he
[13:06.480 --> 13:10.000]  covered up for the Clintons he covered up for Obama he covered up for the
[13:10.000 --> 13:13.080]  Bushes he covered up for everything and he thinks he's the president of this
[13:13.080 --> 13:17.840]  country and he's not so here it is FBI director Ray agrees with you he said
[13:17.840 --> 13:22.080]  that the similar thoughts he said he was a smart lawyer a dedicated public
[13:22.080 --> 13:25.680]  servant well respect within the FBI I think everybody on the other side of
[13:25.680 --> 13:29.760]  the aisle agreed with you when you appointed him and everybody in this
[13:29.760 --> 13:33.440]  Judiciary Committee and probably everybody in this Congress agreed with
[13:33.440 --> 13:37.760]  his appointment as FBI director which was as which was unanimous his
[13:37.760 --> 13:42.280]  reappointment which was unanimous by Republican Bush and Democrat Obama
[13:42.280 --> 13:47.240]  everybody respects that man in this country he made didn't respect that man
[13:47.240 --> 13:52.800]  in this obviously that we knew that would be an exception near and pop it and
[13:52.800 --> 13:57.160]  say I don't so that's how the garbage we're dealing with more of these clips
[13:57.160 --> 14:00.400]  coming up I want to open the phones up as well the toll-free number to join us

[20:52.240 --> 20:55.680]  let me now burrow into the big military news and then coming up the next
[20:55.680 --> 20:59.520]  segment i'm going to open the phones up but if you just joined us we've got
[20:59.520 --> 21:04.400]  more of these clips from congressional testimony yesterday and congressmen and
[21:04.400 --> 21:08.000]  others that were part of the hearing then making statements after it
[21:08.000 --> 21:14.640]  and like trade gowdy foreshadowing that they think the cable be out by next
[21:14.640 --> 21:20.080]  week for violating the hatchet being caught colluding with the entire team
[21:20.080 --> 21:24.480]  on how to fix the investigation into russia gate during the campaign to
[21:24.480 --> 21:31.680]  torpedo donald trump as their american duty to stop those dirty american voters
[21:31.680 --> 21:35.600]  and you see how the economy and the militaries come back and the borders and
[21:35.600 --> 21:41.440]  yeah absolutely they got to stop that immediately
[21:41.440 --> 21:44.240]  because it's all a big russian conspiracy that's brought all this thank you
[21:44.240 --> 21:48.640]  putin but getting serious obviously putin has nothing to do with it
[21:48.640 --> 21:52.080]  other than russia getting out of globalism kicking out some of their own
[21:52.080 --> 21:56.960]  oligarchs has been an example to us now a bunch of other countries are doing it so
[21:56.960 --> 22:00.640]  countries go in cycles you know we pulled out of attorney in 1776
[22:00.640 --> 22:04.480]  we've been involved leading the world in them then russia went under globalist
[22:04.480 --> 22:06.880]  control communist control for 80 something years and
[22:06.880 --> 22:09.920]  they've come out of it they're trying to reform and they're an example to us and
[22:09.920 --> 22:13.440]  we got a bunch of parasite globalists here mad at russia so
[22:13.440 --> 22:18.000]  i guess that in a way is true it's a russian led event the russians led the
[22:18.000 --> 22:21.680]  event to crush isis our military wanted to join in told obama they weren't going
[22:21.680 --> 22:27.120]  to help isis now isis has basically been crushed but here's the new big news
[22:27.120 --> 22:33.200]  ladies and gentlemen north korea trump talking dangerous step to nuclear war
[22:33.200 --> 22:38.320]  by seeking naval blockade and if you actually look at what's going on there
[22:38.320 --> 22:42.320]  is a giant naval force there the sanctions have intensified i don't like
[22:42.320 --> 22:45.360]  north korea i can't stand the north korean regime i love their people i feel
[22:45.360 --> 22:52.000]  so sorry for them but at the same time you've got to be honest and realize
[22:52.800 --> 22:57.600]  that a new large war there would probably turn into a nuclear war very very
[22:57.600 --> 23:01.120]  quickly and we need to listen to what
[23:01.120 --> 23:04.720]  latimer putin is saying because they've got over 10 000
[23:04.720 --> 23:08.480]  operable working nuclear weapons and they have a border
[23:08.480 --> 23:11.760]  with north korea and with china and are right in the middle of this
[23:11.760 --> 23:15.440]  show us provoked north korea to break the new
[23:15.440 --> 23:19.840]  agreement is what putin is saying in one clip then he says the u.s as de facto
[23:19.840 --> 23:23.760]  missile treaty has left it russia is not going to
[23:23.760 --> 23:28.480]  putin says the u.s hurts itself with invented trump collusion case
[23:28.480 --> 23:32.880]  so we'll get into all of those points but what putin saying is you are headed to
[23:32.880 --> 23:36.080]  war it's going to get out of control please
[23:36.080 --> 23:39.920]  stop let's try to somehow work this out but i get
[23:39.920 --> 23:44.240]  trump's point of we've been 30 years of strategic
[23:44.240 --> 23:48.560]  tension and and and strategic patience and north korea is out of control
[23:48.560 --> 23:52.320]  threatening everybody so uh north korea is to blame for most
[23:52.320 --> 23:56.080]  of this but i get daytime i get not wanting a new
[23:56.080 --> 24:00.560]  giant war where people die on all sides
[24:00.560 --> 24:04.560]  i mean this is just a tender box but let's play this clip first
[24:04.560 --> 24:08.320]  putin says u.s hurts itself with invented trump
[24:08.320 --> 24:12.800]  collusion case which it is tearing our country apart
[24:12.800 --> 24:16.480]  and it's just phony as a three dollar bill so let's go ahead and go to that
[24:16.480 --> 24:30.080]  clip
[24:30.080 --> 24:36.560]  well that's been brought in by the nose you know that's been invented by those
[24:36.560 --> 24:41.360]  who are in the opposition people who oppose
[24:41.360 --> 24:49.520]  president trump to delegitimize his uh
[24:49.520 --> 24:55.120]  time in office you know it's really seems strange to me
[24:55.120 --> 25:00.960]  because they don't understand it seems that they don't understand
[25:00.960 --> 25:07.680]  they undermine their own nation
[25:07.680 --> 25:13.520]  they limit the powers of the president has been elected it means that
[25:13.520 --> 25:18.640]  they don't have respect for those people that those americans who elected
[25:18.640 --> 25:25.280]  donald trump and that's it vladimir putin
[25:25.280 --> 25:28.880]  your media your political elite do not respect the american people
[25:28.880 --> 25:32.480]  they do not respect you and they're trying to overthrow
[25:32.480 --> 25:37.280]  your will and what you did constitutionally and we've caught the FBI and
[25:37.280 --> 25:41.920]  the justice department working with leftist groups in russia
[25:41.920 --> 25:46.720]  to try to dummy up fake witnesses and it's all fallen through it's not real
[25:46.720 --> 25:52.240]  to frame our elected president who in one year being
[25:52.240 --> 25:54.880]  president elect not even one year being in office
[25:54.880 --> 25:59.280]  it's ten and a half months right now has delivered
[25:59.280 --> 26:04.240]  at a unbelievable level
[26:04.240 --> 26:07.600]  i mean it's just a fact if you look at the list of accomplishments it's
[26:07.600 --> 26:12.160]  stunning and that's why they're always running around saying
[26:12.160 --> 26:16.560]  that he hasn't delivered trump hasn't delivered in any way
[26:16.560 --> 26:23.520]  then he has no accomplishments because the accomplishments are dizzying
[26:23.520 --> 26:25.680]  we're going to come back from break and play some more of the putin clips then

[33:20.000 --> 33:26.160]  before they happen right here on the alex jones show
[33:26.160 --> 33:31.040]  waging war on corruption crashing the lies and disinformation
[33:31.040 --> 33:37.200]  ladies and gentlemen vladimir putin in a large press briefing yesterday
[33:37.200 --> 33:42.160]  made a lot of very interesting statements that i personally agree with
[33:42.160 --> 33:45.600]  not because i'm some russian agent but because i've done the research
[33:45.600 --> 33:50.160]  he says the russian narrative is totally fake and that the russia
[33:50.160 --> 33:53.040]  narrative being involved with the election is a way to disrespect the
[33:53.040 --> 33:56.960]  american people and discount their votes well now that's been
[33:56.960 --> 34:00.000]  totally proven correct with the congressional hearings
[34:00.000 --> 34:03.520]  with the fbi director when he was deputy director
[34:03.520 --> 34:06.960]  we now have the emails and the notes from meetings
[34:06.960 --> 34:09.600]  saying we're going to keep trump from getting an office we're going to make up
[34:09.600 --> 34:13.120]  the russia stuff violate the hatch act and then all the people
[34:13.120 --> 34:17.040]  stroke and the rest of them involve a fusion gps and the head of the just
[34:17.040 --> 34:21.120]  department operation uh running the russia investigation his
[34:21.120 --> 34:24.240]  wife at fusion gps getting taxpayer money i was like
[34:24.240 --> 34:27.200]  why'd they give him a couple million extra after they'd already been paid 11
[34:27.200 --> 34:31.680]  million for the fake ppgate dossier that's a lot of money for a piece of
[34:31.680 --> 34:35.360]  fiction that's what like steven king gets paid
[34:35.360 --> 34:39.840]  uh so it really is incredible ladies and gentlemen
[34:39.840 --> 34:43.680]  uh to see this uh but expanding on that
[34:43.680 --> 34:51.360]  putin then got into the whole military situation he says
[34:51.360 --> 34:58.800]  us has provoked north korea to break of war and to break the nuclear agreement
[34:58.800 --> 35:02.400]  and again we're not lionizing north korea here but why do the clintons give them
[35:02.400 --> 35:04.880]  the nuclear reactors why did they give them the weapons before
[35:04.880 --> 35:08.880]  why did our elites give china all the weapons and now let them use them as a
[35:08.880 --> 35:12.080]  way to destabilize the region trump's trying to have strength through peace
[35:12.080 --> 35:16.000]  but saying you're not going to do this but north korea is saying it's an active
[35:16.000 --> 35:20.800]  war to have this blockade up that's reportedly going to stop
[35:20.800 --> 35:24.240]  uh some north korean ships they think are carrying weapons
[35:24.240 --> 35:28.000]  to the middle east and other areas like iran and they've been caught before
[35:28.000 --> 35:31.280]  shipping weapons to central asia and the middle east they just caught caught a
[35:31.280 --> 35:34.880]  few months ago so what happens if north korean ships
[35:34.880 --> 35:38.400]  fight back then that's how things escalate very
[35:38.400 --> 35:42.160]  very quickly and the north says they'll attack soul south korea
[35:42.160 --> 35:45.040]  they're just 30 miles away from north korea trump
[35:45.040 --> 35:49.200]  taking dangerous step in nuclear war by seeking naval blockade
[35:49.200 --> 35:52.720]  is it really a blockade you could argue it is and that is an active war
[35:52.720 --> 35:55.600]  u.s president don trump is taking an extremely dangerous and big step
[35:55.600 --> 35:59.280]  towards nuclear war by seeking a naval blockade north korea has stated
[35:59.280 --> 36:03.360]  according to official ncna news agency
[36:03.360 --> 36:07.520]  the north korean government also said it was take merciless
[36:07.520 --> 36:11.520]  self-defense went by kim jong-un eating everybody's food everybody's
[36:11.520 --> 36:14.720]  skinny but him measures against any blockade but why don't you send
[36:14.720 --> 36:18.800]  yourself out to fight them bro as it would consider such a move an active
[36:18.800 --> 36:22.000]  war the north korean government also believes any blockade would be a
[36:22.000 --> 36:25.840]  wanton violation of the sovereignty and dignity
[36:25.840 --> 36:30.080]  of the bloodthirsty satanic vampire excuse me k cna reported
[36:30.080 --> 36:33.840]  citing a foreign ministry spokesperson so let's hear what vladimir
[36:33.840 --> 36:37.760]  putin who has a country the leads he's been elected to
[36:37.760 --> 36:41.360]  ordering north korea let's hear what he had to say about it yesterday
[36:41.360 --> 36:44.800]  i would like to repeat that the basically there was an agreement
[36:44.800 --> 36:49.200]  in between with the north with north korea that in 2005 that they will
[36:49.200 --> 36:52.800]  suspend their nuclear program and they've made certain commitments
[36:52.800 --> 36:56.640]  and everybody was happy we all agreed and signed this agreement then a few
[36:56.640 --> 37:01.200]  months later the united states decided to go beyond this agreement
[37:01.200 --> 37:07.680]  and they froze their assets their bank accounts of north korean
[37:07.680 --> 37:10.880]  they said that north korea should do something in addition to this agreement
[37:10.880 --> 37:14.400]  something that goes beyond that agreement north korea
[37:14.400 --> 37:20.320]  then withdrew from this agreement and relaunched its nuclear program why did
[37:20.320 --> 37:23.680]  you do that this agreement was not enough
[37:23.680 --> 37:26.880]  why did you sign this agreement if you thought this was not enough
[37:26.880 --> 37:30.960]  you provoked north korea to withdraw from this agreement
[37:30.960 --> 37:35.200]  and then it was even worse there was olivia and rock
[37:35.200 --> 37:39.760]  i've mentioned this many times to north korea this is the only way of
[37:39.760 --> 37:46.400]  self-preservation they have to have wmds and missiles and now they have
[37:46.400 --> 37:51.120]  missile that can reach the united states apparently
[37:51.120 --> 37:56.080]  apparently so what good came out of it we think
[37:56.080 --> 38:01.760]  both sides should stop escalating the situation
[38:01.760 --> 38:06.160]  so we i think we heard from the united states that
[38:06.160 --> 38:12.080]  they would stop military drills no now they have another
[38:12.080 --> 38:15.520]  military exercise and north korea responded by
[38:15.520 --> 38:19.200]  launching another missile you have to stop at a certain point you have to
[38:19.200 --> 38:23.840]  stop this from spiraling this is extremely dangerous and we
[38:23.840 --> 38:26.560]  told the united states about this even if you
[38:26.560 --> 38:30.880]  suppose that the united states launched some kind of strike against north korea
[38:30.880 --> 38:35.280]  even if it's a conventional weapons if it's
[38:35.280 --> 38:40.160]  high precision missiles uh where where are you going to strike
[38:40.160 --> 38:44.720]  does the cie know specifically which targets they have to hit
[38:44.720 --> 38:49.440]  with no of course not north korea is a closed country
[38:49.440 --> 38:52.400]  there are things you may know about it and things
[38:52.400 --> 38:58.480]  that you certainly don't know and just if north korea launches its missiles
[38:58.480 --> 39:02.640]  consequences will be catastrophic yes we know that there was an
[39:02.640 --> 39:06.640]  instance when the united states used nuclear weapons
[39:06.640 --> 39:12.160]  there was not one instance when the u.s used nuclear weapons against the
[39:12.160 --> 39:15.520]  japan and even back then i think it was unwarranted
[39:15.520 --> 39:21.200]  but now this will be extremely extremely dangerous if they do that with
[39:21.200 --> 39:26.240]  north korea okay very very important information
[39:26.240 --> 39:29.120]  obviously there and we don't want to have a wider war and
[39:29.120 --> 39:32.560]  all it does increasing sanctions and the rest of this on north korea
[39:32.560 --> 39:36.320]  starve more of their people that are in a giant death cult but you can't let
[39:36.320 --> 39:39.040]  north korea fire missiles and threaten to attack their neighbors it's just
[39:39.040 --> 39:42.960]  it's just it's it's out of control and and the north korean leader
[39:42.960 --> 39:46.640]  needs to leave he needs to step down he needs to be removed
[39:46.640 --> 39:49.520]  now they just punched it up on screen a few minutes ago and i was
[39:49.520 --> 39:52.240]  reading it during during that clip we played
[39:52.240 --> 39:56.000]  drugreport.com it's also up on info wars.com
[39:56.000 --> 40:00.400]  and news wars.com speaker ryan got the siren up there
[40:00.400 --> 40:07.600]  speaker ryan to step aside and leave dc man we have got all of these rhino
[40:07.600 --> 40:11.840]  establishment republicans reportedly that intel has
[40:11.840 --> 40:15.920]  dirt on that are all just suddenly leaving all these senators leaving all
[40:15.920 --> 40:20.480]  these house members leaving all these establishment globalists leaving
[40:20.480 --> 40:23.200]  says despite you know all the accomplishments that trump's gotten
[40:23.200 --> 40:26.880]  with him piled up that he sees his wild washington
[40:26.880 --> 40:30.800]  journey coming to an end and then he will not seek
[40:30.800 --> 40:34.400]  reelection he felt he was made for this moment but
[40:34.400 --> 40:37.440]  now on the verge of achieving his long sought legislative dream
[40:37.440 --> 40:42.240]  he's got his eyes on the exits because he doesn't want to share the ticket
[40:42.240 --> 40:48.960]  with trump in 2020 what so there's a lot of thought goes into this
[40:48.960 --> 40:51.920]  a lot of them are having to step down because they're rhino senators and are
[40:51.920 --> 40:55.920]  involved in corruption we know that let's get roger stone on as quick as we
[40:55.920 --> 41:00.240]  can call him right now guys i'm gonna go to your calls too just just call roger
[41:00.240 --> 41:03.440]  but then they've got a lot of people quitting and leaving they're saying to
[41:03.440 --> 41:09.120]  take away the republican majority to sabotage that to make sure
[41:09.120 --> 41:12.800]  that this whole agenda to restore the republic return power back to washington
[41:12.800 --> 41:16.160]  back to the states back to the people from the offshore globalists this is a
[41:16.160 --> 41:19.440]  way to scuttle it and whether that was originally the case or
[41:19.440 --> 41:23.760]  not the republican blue blood rhino neocon
[41:23.760 --> 41:27.120]  globalist group that are just another wing of the democratic party
[41:27.120 --> 41:31.360]  you know the whole mccain types they are now making lemonade out of lemons and
[41:31.360 --> 41:34.880]  saying oh we're all just leaving because we're not gonna be part of this trump
[41:34.880 --> 41:40.000]  thing and we're gonna go for the democrats in our states
[41:40.000 --> 41:44.160]  and you saw that in alabama so the swamp is deadly
[41:44.160 --> 41:47.600]  and the swamp is striking back and it ties into what drudge
[41:47.600 --> 41:52.000]  and what roger stone and myself it was first drudge warning of it and now
[41:52.000 --> 41:56.240]  a sange have been talking about trump being

[47:00.480 --> 47:21.440]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[47:21.440 --> 47:38.400]  live from austin texas broadcasting worldwide it's alex jones
[47:52.000 --> 47:55.440]  i'm a little late getting back in studio here because we were trying to find out
[47:55.440 --> 48:01.120]  exactly what's going on with paul ryan the big story up on info wars dot com and
[48:01.120 --> 48:06.480]  drug report dot com in red with the siren paul ryan sees his wild washington
[48:06.480 --> 48:09.920]  journey coming to an end they reportedly talked to folks close to him and to him
[48:09.920 --> 48:13.520]  and then he thinks he'll leave rather than be associated with trump
[48:13.520 --> 48:18.000]  that way he can have his cake and eat it too and you'll be a good little rhino
[48:18.000 --> 48:22.000]  but then he also told and reportedly the washington examiner
[48:22.000 --> 48:26.480]  that he laughs off suggestion he'll quit congress after the tax reform bill
[48:26.480 --> 48:31.840]  so this just broke i'm going to get roger stone's expert critique on this
[48:31.840 --> 48:35.200]  right now ladies and gentlemen but the big question is
[48:35.200 --> 48:40.240]  if paul ryan really is going to quit congress and not run again as politico
[48:40.240 --> 48:45.520]  is reporting then why is he really quitting because we know a lot of folks
[48:45.520 --> 48:48.720]  have been pressured out because of things that have been discovered
[48:48.720 --> 48:52.720]  about them and why have we seen so many republican senators leave
[48:52.720 --> 48:57.200]  why so many republican house members who are all rhinos are neocons
[48:57.200 --> 49:00.800]  that's the big question why have all of them left because they're trying to spin
[49:00.800 --> 49:03.920]  it that oh we're leaving so trump doesn't have the votes and we're leaving in
[49:03.920 --> 49:07.280]  states that are kind of purple to throw it to the democrats because trump's so
[49:07.280 --> 49:10.240]  bad but we know early on it was because they were
[49:10.240 --> 49:14.640]  under criminal investigation and other issues what's what's the truth here
[49:14.640 --> 49:17.760]  from your research roger stone
[49:17.760 --> 49:21.920]  well alex um my sources tell me that paul ryan is trying to manage
[49:21.920 --> 49:25.040]  the two problems and therefore i think this leak is
[49:25.040 --> 49:29.840]  credible first is the fact that he was aware
[49:29.840 --> 49:33.280]  of the awan brothers the two pakistani
[49:33.280 --> 49:38.640]  it consultants who penetrated the house of representatives computer system
[49:38.640 --> 49:45.760]  uh uh stole over 16 million dollars uh and were able to access
[49:45.760 --> 49:52.320]  the email back and forth of 45 individual members uh he knew about this
[49:52.320 --> 49:58.400]  as early as last september would have been a bombshell issue for the
[49:58.400 --> 50:04.480]  republicans a big boost to trump but rather than bring this forward to the
[50:04.480 --> 50:08.320]  american people ryan covered it up until
[50:08.320 --> 50:12.880]  january secondarily i think we're going to learn
[50:12.880 --> 50:17.200]  as we reported exclusively and first on info wars
[50:17.200 --> 50:20.480]  when republican money man and hedge fund manager
[50:20.480 --> 50:27.120]  paul singer finance the first iteration of the so-called dirty dossier
[50:27.120 --> 50:32.160]  what you termed ppg uh i believe we're going to learn that paul ryan
[50:32.160 --> 50:37.920]  knew about it and was involved in that subterfuge to undermine trump
[50:37.920 --> 50:40.960]  well that makes sense he was backing jeb bush at the time even though jeb bush
[50:40.960 --> 50:44.560]  had two percentage points in most polls he got more money than all the other
[50:44.560 --> 50:48.080]  16 republicans combined and paul ryan was out there
[50:48.080 --> 50:53.520]  you know gallivanting around uh so uh this just goes on and on and of course
[50:53.520 --> 50:57.840]  he was the buddy buddy it was met ryan all along in his running mate
[50:57.840 --> 51:00.400]  and so that makes perfect sense are you saying that's your
[51:00.400 --> 51:05.280]  guesstimation or that's the intel you've got that's the intel that i have that he's
[51:05.280 --> 51:09.600]  trying to manage both of these problems which is why today's story now becomes
[51:09.600 --> 51:14.000]  entirely logical uh that he would uh get out
[51:14.000 --> 51:19.520]  ahead of these two stories breaking but i think that he's
[51:19.520 --> 51:22.160]  written the handwriting on the wall let's not forget
[51:22.160 --> 51:25.760]  he suspended his support of candidate trump
[51:25.760 --> 51:31.760]  towards the end of october trump won without him and he has systematically
[51:31.760 --> 51:35.600]  worked to undermine the president since then
[51:35.600 --> 51:41.200]  that said the house's track record of passing trump legislation is far far
[51:41.200 --> 51:46.080]  superior to the senate uh i don't think anybody will be
[51:46.080 --> 51:51.920]  sorry to see paul ryan go now this came out politico and he basically says
[51:51.920 --> 51:55.200]  he's looking at it uh the washington examiner does a lot of great work
[51:55.200 --> 51:58.720]  they're saying that he's laughing it off and i'm here trying to read both these
[51:58.720 --> 52:02.240]  articles i mean this just broke 10 15 minutes ago
[52:02.240 --> 52:05.200]  and it sounds to me like he's testing the waters here
[52:05.200 --> 52:09.360]  in classic uh fake conservative fashion
[52:09.360 --> 52:12.880]  either that or what we have here is a premature leak
[52:12.880 --> 52:17.520]  and therefore this got out before he wanted it out and therefore he's gonna
[52:17.520 --> 52:21.360]  pervericate sure he wanted the tax reform victory first to make it look
[52:21.360 --> 52:25.200]  like he was a kind of a conservative then segway out for a while
[52:25.200 --> 52:29.440]  and then clean things up and then try to come back in a presidential run
[52:29.440 --> 52:32.640]  well i don't know if he comes back around as your president but i do think
[52:32.640 --> 52:36.880]  that he wants to get the kudos from wall street because as you know
[52:36.880 --> 52:42.960]  they have loaded up the president's tax cut bill with a lot of
[52:42.960 --> 52:46.800]  of benefits for wall street there's a lot of
[52:46.800 --> 52:51.120]  favors in there for the big boy so my guess is that he's looking for a
[52:51.120 --> 52:56.560]  soft landing if he delivers for wall street within the tax cut bill
[52:56.560 --> 53:00.560]  he could then move on to a far more lucrative life
[53:00.560 --> 53:04.640]  as you know washington is a revolving door
[53:04.640 --> 53:07.840]  well we've got a big favorable unfavorable
[53:07.840 --> 53:12.640]  trend rating report that the hubby can post his reporting on it's
[53:12.640 --> 53:16.400]  i guess an index of different different polls but
[53:16.400 --> 53:20.240]  his his unfavorable is just skyrocketing right now
[53:20.240 --> 53:27.200]  upwards to 50 49.3 favorable 29 that's the left's little darling like mccain
[53:27.200 --> 53:33.360]  so so that says a lot right there uh look i think it would be a positive
[53:33.360 --> 53:36.960]  if he leads for the president of course we're going to have an immediate
[53:36.960 --> 53:41.280]  squabble to see who would replace him and it's early to do that
[53:41.280 --> 53:45.200]  into capping but if i had to place a bet today i think he's going
[53:45.200 --> 53:48.320]  you're absolutely right he's waiting till he gets his
[53:48.320 --> 53:51.840]  kudos from wall street in the tax cut legislation before he
[53:51.840 --> 53:55.840]  announces it sure i mean why not get somebody real and hardcore
[53:55.840 --> 53:59.520]  why not get a trey gowdy or a jim jordan and not one of the guys that's proven
[53:59.520 --> 54:03.600]  he's an old party hack don't we want uh you know a storm trooper here don't we
[54:03.600 --> 54:08.560]  want a shop troupe don't we want somebody like a trey gowdy or a jim jordan
[54:08.560 --> 54:12.560]  yeah we need a firebrand but as you know the u.s. house of representatives
[54:12.560 --> 54:16.640]  rarely works that way usually it's the next guy
[54:16.640 --> 54:20.080]  in line that's like this royalty i'm sick of this crap we should have a
[54:20.080 --> 54:23.600]  popularity contest with conservatives libertarians
[54:23.600 --> 54:27.760]  we need somebody out in the freedom caucus we need somebody who's a
[54:27.760 --> 54:31.840]  non-establishment free thinker um but there's plenty of time
[54:31.840 --> 54:35.440]  for that i guarantee you right now the handicapping and
[54:35.440 --> 54:39.760]  in the crib sheets of vote counting have begun well sure i mean i mean going up
[54:39.760 --> 54:43.120]  their normal fossilized imperial you know
[54:43.120 --> 54:47.120]  egyptian style or british royalty style secession system
[54:47.120 --> 54:53.840]  who's next in line for the royalty uh i do not i think it is uh whoever is the
[54:53.840 --> 54:58.160]  chairman of the conference i look as likely to be some established republican
[54:58.160 --> 55:02.160]  non-entity look at the people who have held this job
[55:02.160 --> 55:07.040]  so we'll be digging into that almost immediately and the vote would be great
[55:07.040 --> 55:10.400]  to have a firebrand like like trey gowdy or jim jordan who is smart
[55:10.400 --> 55:13.520]  and actually care about the country that would be great leadership
[55:13.520 --> 55:18.480]  and tough more importantly tough and as partisan as the democrats are
[55:18.480 --> 55:22.240]  now it's funny because paul ryan comes from uh you know he claims to be an
[55:22.240 --> 55:26.080]  actual item late jack campy comes from the right but
[55:26.080 --> 55:29.440]  he is he is really particular on immigration he is
[55:29.440 --> 55:33.360]  particularly an establishment republican he's a big leaker to the media and
[55:33.360 --> 55:36.640]  works with the globalist he's a he's just he's such a piece of garbage
[55:36.640 --> 55:39.920]  i've heard little birdies tell me there's a lot of dirt on him i'm not just the
[55:39.920 --> 55:42.880]  hacking of his emails that the democrats have been using but a lot of stuff
[55:42.880 --> 55:47.200]  that so there's a lot of reasons why eddie munster you know all grown up
[55:47.200 --> 55:51.120]  why eddie munster meets caldracula why count chocula
[55:51.120 --> 55:56.320]  uh is leaving well so you've got the awan brother's cover-up the debbie
[55:56.320 --> 56:02.000]  washer mcchilts uh cover-up you've got his connections to the dirty dossier
[56:02.000 --> 56:06.160]  uh more than that we don't know but let's remember we're still waiting for the
[56:06.160 --> 56:11.280]  list of congressmen uh and senators who have uh
[56:11.280 --> 56:15.280]  had to pay out billions in taxpayer funds to settle sexual
[56:15.280 --> 56:18.800]  harassment that's right i'm not saying i'm not saying
[56:18.800 --> 56:22.000]  that ryan's on the list but what does he know about the list
[56:22.000 --> 56:25.920]  and why has he told us who's on the list exactly all right

[1:00:08.000 --> 1:00:11.360]  he has the answer they don't want you to hear
[1:00:11.360 --> 1:00:18.240]  he is alex jones uh nbc news is reporting it
[1:00:18.240 --> 1:00:22.720]  as soon as we get an audio feed we'll uh hit this on air for you this just broke
[1:00:22.720 --> 1:00:27.600]  you know we've had a lot of reportage uh dr course he has it's gone viral
[1:00:27.600 --> 1:00:31.200]  about the death threats against agi pie the head of the fcc
[1:00:31.200 --> 1:00:34.880]  and people said they're going to kill him because he won't let obama's
[1:00:34.880 --> 1:00:39.120]  net neutrality stay in that lets google facebook twitter censor everybody
[1:00:39.120 --> 1:00:42.800]  and then have their own systems of throttle content slow down content
[1:00:42.800 --> 1:00:46.080]  block content but then not let everybody else do it
[1:00:46.080 --> 1:00:49.760]  agi pie says go back to what we had that was closer to net neutrality
[1:00:49.760 --> 1:00:53.360]  but that also lets companies you know have exclusive content let people pay
[1:00:53.360 --> 1:00:57.760]  more to get better streaming from them which i'm not saying is perfect this
[1:00:57.760 --> 1:01:00.560]  stuff's like making sausage and i've had top experts on i've
[1:01:00.560 --> 1:01:04.320]  researched it but definitely the obama power grab we know
[1:01:04.320 --> 1:01:08.400]  was not net neutrality it was a big step in the wrong direction
[1:01:08.400 --> 1:01:11.680]  uh and so we've now uh going to have that in the next segment
[1:01:11.680 --> 1:01:16.800]  uh some video of that uh agi pie it's up on info wars dot com
[1:01:16.800 --> 1:01:20.800]  right now they had a live video feed at the fcc they had to cut it
[1:01:20.800 --> 1:01:24.160]  uh i guess somebody attacked him this is what they're saying
[1:01:24.160 --> 1:01:31.040]  uh so uh we've got all that um going on here so
[1:01:31.040 --> 1:01:34.560]  we're going to be breaking all of that down in the next segment we're going to
[1:01:34.560 --> 1:01:38.000]  get that clip was tweeted out by nbc we get that posted
[1:01:38.000 --> 1:01:43.600]  to info wars dot com we'll have that for you uh in the next segment uh right now
[1:01:43.600 --> 1:01:46.240]  though let's go ahead and start taking phone calls
[1:01:46.240 --> 1:01:49.360]  let's talk to kevin in west virginia thank you for holding on this thursday
[1:01:49.360 --> 1:01:53.200]  edition hey alex hey um i have a solution i think
[1:01:53.200 --> 1:01:57.360]  for congress and before i say it i have two questions to go with my solution
[1:01:57.360 --> 1:02:02.080]  i want to know if it if it's a plausible and if it's b workable
[1:02:02.080 --> 1:02:06.560]  and my solution for congress says trump pardons gives everybody a presidential
[1:02:06.560 --> 1:02:10.000]  pardon in congress but in order to receive your pardon
[1:02:10.000 --> 1:02:15.520]  they have to publicly come out and name their blackmailers
[1:02:15.520 --> 1:02:18.320]  i think that's a great idea that's been done throughout history before
[1:02:18.320 --> 1:02:22.480]  that if people that are part of a criminal conspiracy but they were
[1:02:22.480 --> 1:02:26.480]  brought into it under duress then under common law
[1:02:26.480 --> 1:02:29.520]  if you go and throw yourself in the mercy of the court
[1:02:29.520 --> 1:02:34.240]  they generally will let you off uh if you've not been involved in treachery
[1:02:34.240 --> 1:02:37.680]  willingly uh you kind of get your own pardon from the court but it could be
[1:02:37.680 --> 1:02:42.480]  offered as a pardon that's been done many times under british and english
[1:02:42.480 --> 1:02:46.400]  uh common law it's also biblical uh jude
[1:02:46.400 --> 1:02:50.000]  a judaic law has has those type of things in it that if you were
[1:02:50.000 --> 1:02:54.720]  dressed into something uh and then you you come clean and help stop the larger
[1:02:54.720 --> 1:02:59.760]  conspiracy for the greater good uh then you are given a pardon that's a very good
[1:02:59.760 --> 1:03:03.280]  idea kevin all right and i mean i had heard this
[1:03:03.280 --> 1:03:06.640]  off of a few other people too and i had you know had thought about it
[1:03:06.640 --> 1:03:10.080]  the other thing that i wanted to mention to you is social contracts
[1:03:10.080 --> 1:03:14.480]  um alabama has proven to me that we no longer have a social contract with the
[1:03:14.480 --> 1:03:18.080]  government and then there's you know i've been thinking
[1:03:18.080 --> 1:03:24.160]  of uh trying to possibly rebirth page two of the declaration of independence
[1:03:24.160 --> 1:03:28.880]  and i keep coming up with um having going to the international court of hagg
[1:03:28.880 --> 1:03:35.040]  and uh putting a note a notification that every state becomes a nation state
[1:03:35.040 --> 1:03:39.040]  and then we can rebirth the um well that that's actually true that'd be a way
[1:03:39.040 --> 1:03:42.320]  to reverse it but then you have to be arguing that it has the
[1:03:42.320 --> 1:03:46.800]  plenary power of the human it's a fraud but the states
[1:03:46.800 --> 1:03:50.160]  can actually pull out themselves and then have a new
[1:03:50.160 --> 1:03:54.720]  basic convention and then reestablish the republic if the executive
[1:03:54.720 --> 1:03:58.400]  and the legislative federally went rogue but we're kind of already doing that
[1:03:58.400 --> 1:04:01.040]  through the states and through trump right now that's why we're in the middle
[1:04:01.040 --> 1:04:06.000]  of a revolutionary war but now what you're saying is is is real it's like
[1:04:06.000 --> 1:04:10.080]  catalan and others went to the un and said hey we want to be able to break away
[1:04:10.080 --> 1:04:12.800]  like kosovo because the muslims said they were
[1:04:12.800 --> 1:04:15.760]  and you said that was normal but then when we want to break away even though we
[1:04:15.760 --> 1:04:19.440]  have been here for thousands of years and are not spanish you tell us we can't
[1:04:19.440 --> 1:04:23.440]  when the albanians invaded you said oh yes your your serbs you can break away
[1:04:23.440 --> 1:04:27.920]  and be kosovo folks uh so it's totally hypocritical
[1:04:27.920 --> 1:04:31.120]  how that whole thing's been executed uh so
[1:04:31.120 --> 1:04:34.240]  you know the un only does it when they want to but it's a good point
[1:04:34.240 --> 1:04:38.000]  kevin very sophisticated points thank you for really upping a mind
[1:04:38.000 --> 1:04:42.800]  thought process he says i gotta tell you all right cindy colt alex isa john

[1:07:50.960 --> 1:07:54.640]  communication lawyers i've had talks with other lawyers i've
[1:07:54.640 --> 1:07:59.600]  interviewed experts on it and what ogie pie is putting forward is
[1:07:59.600 --> 1:08:04.320]  what was there before obama put in a telecommunications bill
[1:08:04.320 --> 1:08:08.720]  and got it into law that allows them to censor that's why this is all started
[1:08:08.720 --> 1:08:14.320]  so we know what they did's bad that can you guys print me ogie pie's letter
[1:08:14.320 --> 1:08:17.120]  a week ago that i made such a big deal off because it was huge
[1:08:17.120 --> 1:08:20.080]  going how dare you claim we're going to censor somebody
[1:08:20.080 --> 1:08:23.920]  when you were trying to hand it over to the u in and george soros
[1:08:23.920 --> 1:08:27.680]  and you've been caught censoring everybody i mean that that's what they're
[1:08:27.680 --> 1:08:31.840]  doing george soros is being banned in europe

[1:08:35.920 --> 1:08:40.720]  banned everywhere he goes in and just takes over
[1:08:40.720 --> 1:08:44.080]  that is just incredible uh russia is saying the u.s and north korea both
[1:08:44.080 --> 1:08:46.960]  need to cool it everybody's stemming towards war
[1:08:46.960 --> 1:08:50.560]  we've got paul ryan saying reportedly according to politico
[1:08:50.560 --> 1:08:54.560]  who is fake news sometimes uh that uh he's going to be stepping down the next
[1:08:54.560 --> 1:08:57.840]  year now reportedly what other publications are
[1:08:57.840 --> 1:09:01.280]  saying that that's not the case that's the washington examiner
[1:09:01.280 --> 1:09:06.080]  paul ryan laughs off suggestions he'll quit congress at her tax reform
[1:09:06.080 --> 1:09:10.400]  meanwhile law firm french government aware of and aided
[1:09:10.400 --> 1:09:14.400]  1994 rwandan genocide only a law firm to tell me
[1:09:14.400 --> 1:09:18.720]  the un sent in troops and helped the majority non christian group
[1:09:18.720 --> 1:09:22.640]  killed at least 800 000 people in a hundred day spree because christians
[1:09:22.640 --> 1:09:25.200]  controlled most of the country because of their culture
[1:09:25.200 --> 1:09:28.080]  had the most wealth because they didn't just kill each other they produced wealth
[1:09:28.080 --> 1:09:31.920]  and so they were killed by the animus group and the un and well companies
[1:09:31.920 --> 1:09:34.880]  to take the land that stories up on info wars
[1:09:34.880 --> 1:09:38.480]  dot com there's the article out of reuters pakistan orders george soros
[1:09:38.480 --> 1:09:43.280]  foundation other age groups to close so they're really multinational
[1:09:43.280 --> 1:09:47.440]  intelligence agencies so we've got all that information
[1:09:47.440 --> 1:09:50.960]  as well i got a bunch of clips i haven't gotten to yet
[1:09:50.960 --> 1:09:54.960]  and a lot of politics uh and the so-called sexual misconduct news the
[1:09:54.960 --> 1:10:00.080]  economy all of it but right now let's go to your phone calls
[1:10:00.080 --> 1:10:03.680]  to discuss whatever it is you want to talk about on this worldwide live

[1:10:19.120 --> 1:10:22.400]  nice quick moving a lot of new things getting added to it
[1:10:22.400 --> 1:10:26.080]  present planets quick to load as well they all have original content
[1:10:26.080 --> 1:10:30.480]  they're about 75 into the same content but about
[1:10:30.480 --> 1:10:34.960]  25 percent is different original content you only find on news wars
[1:10:34.960 --> 1:10:38.320]  or present planet or info wars and remember
[1:10:38.320 --> 1:10:41.280]  i know you're awake i know you're involved you're incredible thank you
[1:10:41.280 --> 1:10:45.120]  you're the reason we've gotten this far but the globalists know they're losing
[1:10:45.120 --> 1:10:47.600]  now so they're intensifying their operations
[1:10:47.600 --> 1:10:50.160]  that's why now when you spread an article when you spread a video when you
[1:10:50.160 --> 1:10:53.040]  get the information out no one else is going to do it
[1:10:53.040 --> 1:10:56.640]  if it's not you so that's why you are the backbone of this while google
[1:10:56.640 --> 1:11:00.880]  facebook twitter and all of them openly try to cut us back block us do this
[1:11:00.880 --> 1:11:04.400]  it still gets out when you copy our videos to your youtube channel don't
[1:11:04.400 --> 1:11:09.040]  have a youtube channel start one uh when you tell neighbors about the show or
[1:11:09.040 --> 1:11:11.680]  make a copy of you know some of the broadcast and give it to them on thumb
[1:11:11.680 --> 1:11:15.040]  drive or get a present planet dot tv membership and share it with them or
[1:11:15.040 --> 1:11:18.480]  just point them in the right direction it's those of you doing this

[1:11:34.560 --> 1:11:38.000]  what's on your mind today good afternoon um
[1:11:38.000 --> 1:11:45.760]  alex i think that the left is freaking out they try to get trump with this
[1:11:45.760 --> 1:11:50.720]  false dossier stuff and now it's come out
[1:11:50.720 --> 1:11:53.840]  and it's a bunch of lies and they're all freaking out
[1:11:53.840 --> 1:11:58.880]  so what did they do they threw sexual harassment
[1:11:58.880 --> 1:12:06.880]  at them and now they have the accusers being proven that
[1:12:06.880 --> 1:12:12.320]  they have taken bribes and all of this and what they did was
[1:12:12.320 --> 1:12:17.280]  they cut off their own arms it was one of
[1:12:17.280 --> 1:12:21.280]  the feminist movement is one of their go-to
[1:12:21.280 --> 1:12:26.480]  movements that they push at us all the time and it has little arms
[1:12:26.480 --> 1:12:31.680]  but they put it they threw that at it and now
[1:12:31.680 --> 1:12:37.440]  it's being destroyed and it's great that it's the
[1:12:37.440 --> 1:12:43.760]  feminist movement has destroyed part of america and it's great that it's
[1:12:43.760 --> 1:12:49.920]  now going to be cut well ma'am you can say what you want about
[1:12:49.920 --> 1:12:54.400]  trump or i can say what i want you have globalists that hijacked the country
[1:12:54.400 --> 1:12:57.200]  and they were transferring power out as fast as they could
[1:12:57.200 --> 1:13:00.880]  to the tpp uh to the imf to the world bank to the
[1:13:00.880 --> 1:13:04.400]  wto and to themselves their wives their husbands
[1:13:04.400 --> 1:13:07.840]  shared the boards and then the the prime ministers and others would
[1:13:07.840 --> 1:13:11.920]  literally transfer national power taxation power everything to unelected
[1:13:11.920 --> 1:13:15.440]  secret groups they would tell congress they would tell the uk parliament
[1:13:15.440 --> 1:13:19.280]  you can't see the agreement so that's what breaks it
[1:13:19.280 --> 1:13:23.520]  and trump pulling out of the tpp and all of this is about us saying no
[1:13:23.520 --> 1:13:26.960]  we're removing power back to america back to washington
[1:13:26.960 --> 1:13:30.400]  back to the states back to the counties back to the cities back to the families
[1:13:30.400 --> 1:13:34.160]  back to the individuals and that's why they're mad
[1:13:34.160 --> 1:13:38.480]  they had successfully hijacked the country but before they could set up a
[1:13:38.480 --> 1:13:41.840]  total global police state to stop us taking back control
[1:13:41.840 --> 1:13:46.640]  we're using the old original systems that are constitutional and legitimate
[1:13:46.640 --> 1:13:50.560]  to take them out thank you so much for the call great point cindy
[1:13:50.560 --> 1:13:54.080]  it'd be like if you owned a company you hear about this all the time in the news
[1:13:54.080 --> 1:13:57.120]  you got people managing you got a couple companies you kind of halfway retire
[1:13:57.120 --> 1:13:59.520]  let somebody else kind of run it all of a sudden you're not getting paid your
[1:13:59.520 --> 1:14:02.240]  yearly money or whatever you're supposed to get a percentage the profit
[1:14:02.240 --> 1:14:05.360]  because you have a manager that you know runs the company and they try to get
[1:14:05.360 --> 1:14:08.160]  to the board of directors and kick you off and take it over and
[1:14:08.160 --> 1:14:10.960]  say that it's their company and you just wall sin and take it back
[1:14:10.960 --> 1:14:14.720]  about 90 percent of the time takeovers internally don't work
[1:14:14.720 --> 1:14:18.640]  but delusional people get in the positions of believing
[1:14:18.640 --> 1:14:23.120]  that because they've been given power to make decisions that they are
[1:14:23.120 --> 1:14:26.640]  you know the the actual owners well we the people are the owners
[1:14:26.640 --> 1:14:30.480]  and we came home and we're back it's kind of like ulysses has
[1:14:30.480 --> 1:14:34.000]  gone for 30 years or whatever and he shows up and men have taken over his
[1:14:34.000 --> 1:14:37.280]  his farm his plantation and you know they're in there with his wife and
[1:14:37.280 --> 1:14:40.560]  daughters basically beating them up got him as slaves and
[1:14:40.560 --> 1:14:44.160]  they got a contest of who can shoot through all the uh ax heads
[1:14:44.160 --> 1:14:48.320]  and he doesn't just kill them all himself up front he first beats them all
[1:14:48.320 --> 1:14:51.600]  shooting the arrow through all the ax heads proves he's better than them
[1:14:51.600 --> 1:14:57.120]  then he kills them and so that's that's an arc type of what all this is about
[1:14:57.120 --> 1:15:00.480]  great great great points we're going to come back go right to cult alex isa

[1:24:58.640 --> 1:25:01.760]  wind blowing but today it's actually 60 degrees and
[1:25:01.760 --> 1:25:06.880]  pretty nice sounds like a lovely day so i got a couple things i want to talk
[1:25:06.880 --> 1:25:10.880]  about uh number one uh i got to i want to i want to
[1:25:10.880 --> 1:25:13.840]  give a little bit of background so you know where i'm coming from
[1:25:13.840 --> 1:25:17.360]  uh i'm from actually clearwater kansas and
[1:25:17.360 --> 1:25:21.680]  i grew up on a ranch and stuff we bail our own hay and stuff and
[1:25:21.680 --> 1:25:25.280]  clean stalls you know always through my childhood you can get a buck you can run
[1:25:25.280 --> 1:25:32.480]  a trot line i'll try so uh as i've got older now i
[1:25:32.480 --> 1:25:36.800]  when i bail hay every year my sinuses just go nuts after the second and third
[1:25:36.800 --> 1:25:40.800]  day well i heard about your caveman and so i started
[1:25:40.800 --> 1:25:44.160]  trying it and actually i haven't got sick at all and i've been
[1:25:44.160 --> 1:25:50.000]  taking it for eight months now wow and i mean just like cold sick you know i
[1:25:50.000 --> 1:25:54.080]  usually sinuses and stuff between changing seasons
[1:25:54.080 --> 1:25:58.880]  you know your sinuses wear up since i've been taking caveman i have had any
[1:25:58.880 --> 1:26:01.600]  problem i haven't got sick one time i couldn't
[1:26:01.600 --> 1:26:04.560]  believe it you know it's funny you say that because i've from time to time go
[1:26:04.560 --> 1:26:07.440]  read the reviews and people talked about reduced
[1:26:07.440 --> 1:26:13.040]  allergies and look here's the deal they give you a bowl of chicken soup
[1:26:13.040 --> 1:26:16.000]  and everybody knows it's been associated with getting well quicker this is
[1:26:16.000 --> 1:26:19.600]  hundreds of times stronger per serving it's concentrated
[1:26:19.600 --> 1:26:23.440]  organic chicken bone with chaga mushroom
[1:26:23.440 --> 1:26:27.680]  bee pollen and a bunch of stuff that is actually known to be anti-inflammatory
[1:26:27.680 --> 1:26:32.720]  uh but we put it as an antioxidant and so i mean it really is an insane formula
[1:26:32.720 --> 1:26:35.440]  and for bodybuilders for people that are working out
[1:26:35.440 --> 1:26:39.120]  uh i just i saw three or four years ago that the biggest hottest thing in
[1:26:39.120 --> 1:26:43.360]  bodybuilding and in the olympic athletes and in nfl players
[1:26:43.360 --> 1:26:46.640]  but also folks who wanted to detoxify for and for weight loss as well depending
[1:26:46.640 --> 1:26:50.400]  on how you want to use it would be bone broth boiling down chicken bones
[1:26:50.400 --> 1:26:53.680]  boiling down beef bones but beef can have some issues when we went with
[1:26:53.680 --> 1:26:57.920]  chicken and that for uh your bones your
[1:26:57.920 --> 1:27:01.520]  cartilage your energy it's it's it's if you remember to just take a
[1:27:01.520 --> 1:27:05.360]  scoop of it with your milk or mix it with whey like i do so it tastes good
[1:27:05.360 --> 1:27:08.800]  it's it's it's crazy how good these products are so i didn't mean to go into
[1:27:08.800 --> 1:27:12.000]  a whole other plug about it but yeah caveman's been sold out it's funny i
[1:27:12.000 --> 1:27:16.080]  just mentioned it's been sold out it's now back in stock if people just try
[1:27:16.080 --> 1:27:21.920]  this ultimate bone broth formula uh they will see for themselves what it does
[1:27:21.920 --> 1:27:24.880]  within a week or so so thank you for the plug my friend
[1:27:24.880 --> 1:27:28.800]  it is yeah i i'm it's amazing i love it so anyways is
[1:27:28.800 --> 1:27:33.440]  is there uh do you have in the work anything like a kids cave for like my
[1:27:33.440 --> 1:27:36.160]  daughter you know she's growing she's five years old
[1:27:36.160 --> 1:27:39.360]  i'd like for her to get you know a lot of those nutrients and
[1:27:39.360 --> 1:27:42.640]  she gets sick at least once a month gets a cold or
[1:27:42.640 --> 1:27:46.480]  you know sciences flare up well i was about to say i mean i give caveman
[1:27:46.480 --> 1:27:51.600]  because my daughter's and my son love uh you know way shakes so so we have
[1:27:51.600 --> 1:27:54.880]  really good organic whey we sell it's one of the top in the country clean pure
[1:27:54.880 --> 1:27:58.800]  we's private labeled it caveman's proprietary and i just put a half scoop
[1:27:58.800 --> 1:28:02.320]  in for them a couple scoops away some strawberries if it's the strawberry
[1:28:02.320 --> 1:28:04.960]  flavor the chocolate flavor i just leave it like that
[1:28:04.960 --> 1:28:09.760]  maybe put just a tiny squirt of something like
[1:28:09.760 --> 1:28:13.520]  let me just a little bit of you know syrup from agave or whatever
[1:28:13.520 --> 1:28:16.640]  and then they slurp it all down and they love it and it's funny you say that
[1:28:16.640 --> 1:28:19.840]  because kids go to school my kids used to get sick maybe three or four times a

[1:33:35.040 --> 1:33:38.800]  so they voted three to two along partisan lines
[1:33:38.800 --> 1:33:42.400]  at the FCC to repeal net neutrality now
[1:33:42.400 --> 1:33:49.680]  obama called the last package of regulations and legislation
[1:33:49.680 --> 1:33:58.480]  net neutrality it'd be like if i named a bill eternal life
[1:33:58.480 --> 1:34:04.320]  and the bill actually said that at age 30 everybody had to be
[1:34:04.320 --> 1:34:08.160]  killed like logan's run and then if somebody repealed that everybody had to
[1:34:08.160 --> 1:34:11.920]  be killed at age 30 they would say well they've repealed
[1:34:11.920 --> 1:34:16.480]  eternal life you're like no actually this kills everybody at age 30
[1:34:16.480 --> 1:34:21.760]  but it's called eternal life it's like in spinal tap
[1:34:21.760 --> 1:34:25.440]  he goes and this amplifier goes up to 11
[1:34:25.440 --> 1:34:28.240]  and they go but why don't you just have it just be louder and go to 10 he goes
[1:34:28.240 --> 1:34:31.040]  but it's 11
[1:34:32.240 --> 1:34:36.480]  yeah send you up the logan's run carousel at age 30 and
[1:34:36.480 --> 1:34:42.240]  vaporize you under eugenics law carousel carousel all run by a
[1:34:42.240 --> 1:34:46.720]  technotronic technocracy i think i've heard of this again lately
[1:34:46.720 --> 1:34:53.680]  anyways i'm digressing so that's what they do
[1:34:53.680 --> 1:34:57.440]  and they think we're idiots now does that mean what the republicans are
[1:34:57.440 --> 1:35:04.000]  bringing in or what's being proposed to replace it
[1:35:04.000 --> 1:35:08.720]  is any better well it's not open naked censorship by
[1:35:08.720 --> 1:35:12.480]  google facebook and twitter who under the old rules and under the new ones that
[1:35:12.480 --> 1:35:17.120]  obama put in can censor do whatever and run real
[1:35:17.120 --> 1:35:21.680]  blocking real control not just slowing down your content blocking your content
[1:35:21.680 --> 1:35:24.640]  or redirecting your content or putting you into a place where
[1:35:24.640 --> 1:35:28.880]  nobody can see you or putting messages up saying sure you want to go here
[1:35:28.880 --> 1:35:33.360]  i mean that's the opposite of net neutrality sweetheart
[1:35:33.360 --> 1:35:37.280]  that's the opposite of the digital millennium copyright act of 15 years
[1:35:37.280 --> 1:35:41.040]  ago and stuff that made sense
[1:35:41.040 --> 1:35:45.120]  no i've been running an internet operation for 20 something years i got
[1:35:45.120 --> 1:35:48.400]  the tech people i read the news i know what this is
[1:35:48.400 --> 1:35:51.920]  and i've experienced the censorship and i've got the congressional hearings
[1:35:51.920 --> 1:35:56.160]  admitting their censoring but i've got beyond the congressional
[1:35:56.160 --> 1:35:58.560]  hearings
[1:35:58.560 --> 1:36:04.800]  i've experienced it and i've witnessed it and i've watched it
[1:36:04.800 --> 1:36:09.280]  and now i sit there and watch them play on everyone
[1:36:09.280 --> 1:36:14.000]  like trumps hitler trumps can implode the economy the opposite happens or
[1:36:14.000 --> 1:36:19.680]  oh the FCC repeals net neutrality now most of the headlines are net
[1:36:19.680 --> 1:36:22.960]  neutrality is over
[1:36:23.440 --> 1:36:26.560]  you know that's what the associated press and people were saying
[1:36:26.560 --> 1:36:29.600]  the verdict says the FCC just killed net neutrality
[1:36:29.600 --> 1:36:34.320]  no they just killed legislation and laws that were called net neutrality
[1:36:34.320 --> 1:36:39.680]  see the globalists play semantical games ladies and gentlemen
[1:36:39.680 --> 1:36:43.840]  and i wonder how the public is so stupid because
[1:36:43.840 --> 1:36:50.080]  rt actually got it right when they said FCC repeals net neutrality and what
[1:36:50.080 --> 1:36:56.640]  did rt the evil russians do they put it in quotes
[1:36:56.640 --> 1:37:01.440]  because that's what they're calling the legislation is net neutrality
[1:37:01.440 --> 1:37:05.280]  the law it was not it's what obama did and have you enjoyed the record
[1:37:05.280 --> 1:37:08.640]  censorship have you enjoyed the record low speeds for libertarian and
[1:37:08.640 --> 1:37:10.800]  patriot sides are not even being able to get to them
[1:37:10.800 --> 1:37:14.800]  have you enjoyed all the internet and isp companies kicking conservatives and
[1:37:14.800 --> 1:37:18.640]  libertarians off their domain registrar i mean baby
[1:37:18.640 --> 1:37:25.600]  that's not having an open free internet that's killing net neutrality
[1:37:25.600 --> 1:37:29.520]  but the big telecoms time warner
[1:37:29.520 --> 1:37:35.600]  and AT&T their their villains as well they've just been getting shafted
[1:37:35.600 --> 1:37:39.040]  the last eight nine years by google and facebook and twitter at the top
[1:37:39.040 --> 1:37:43.200]  so they're going oh we need to replace it with something now
[1:37:43.200 --> 1:37:47.360]  and then a lot of that has bad stuff in it and a lot of that is just classic
[1:37:47.360 --> 1:37:50.080]  we're going to charge you more when you go over our network or charge you more
[1:37:50.080 --> 1:37:54.400]  to have better connections and all the rest of it and kind of give you a
[1:37:54.400 --> 1:37:56.400]  forced list of things you're going to look at
[1:37:56.400 --> 1:38:00.320]  on the front page that's already going on and we're against that
[1:38:00.320 --> 1:38:03.600]  but they play this game like like like like trump said about taxes he goes i
[1:38:03.600 --> 1:38:06.880]  don't like to call it tax reform because that could go up that could go down
[1:38:06.880 --> 1:38:10.800]  you get run over by buses i've always said
[1:38:10.800 --> 1:38:14.400]  you're reformed i mean it breaks every bone in your body
[1:38:14.400 --> 1:38:18.560]  it's going 60 miles an hour it hits you you're dead you're for 100 yards down
[1:38:18.560 --> 1:38:21.680]  the road splattered there's a heart there's a
[1:38:21.680 --> 1:38:25.280]  spleen there's a leg there's a head every bone your body's broken you are
[1:38:25.280 --> 1:38:30.160]  reformed is that necessarily a good thing when cancer takes over your body
[1:38:30.160 --> 1:38:33.040]  it reforms your cells is it a good thing no
[1:38:33.040 --> 1:38:39.760]  it's tax cuts tax cuts same thing here they play games
[1:38:39.760 --> 1:38:43.360]  the telecoms are proposing a lot of bad stuff of course they're big globalists
[1:38:43.360 --> 1:38:45.760]  they're pigs they want to consolidate control
[1:38:45.760 --> 1:38:49.440]  you think time Warner and AT&T are conservative
[1:38:49.440 --> 1:38:53.680]  they just haven't been winning like facebook twitter
[1:38:53.680 --> 1:38:57.280]  and google they've been kind of pushed aside because they were kind of old
[1:38:57.280 --> 1:39:01.280]  telecoms and weren't as sophisticated they didn't see what was happening with
[1:39:01.280 --> 1:39:05.280]  the net companies so they go out and tell the
[1:39:05.280 --> 1:39:08.240]  left oh agi pie is going to take the internet away from you
[1:39:08.240 --> 1:39:11.520]  while the left is sharing to ban everybody off twitter facebook and youtube
[1:39:11.520 --> 1:39:16.480]  and the big companies are doing it or slowing you down or blocking you
[1:39:16.480 --> 1:39:20.720]  and the left's like censor them shut them off agi pie wants to censor
[1:39:20.720 --> 1:39:25.840]  get him under the earlier version of the net neutrality bill
[1:39:25.840 --> 1:39:30.880]  the ewin would have had full control and soros is in the wiki leaks
[1:39:30.880 --> 1:39:34.800]  saying that we're going to take full control and block conservative or
[1:39:34.800 --> 1:39:38.480]  nationalist news and only have our news there's quotes by him
[1:39:38.480 --> 1:39:41.600]  him saying we're going to control everything in the west
[1:39:41.600 --> 1:39:45.920]  we're going to control what you read that censorship that's authoritarianism
[1:39:45.920 --> 1:39:52.320]  that's evil that's wrong that's bad that's what you've done
[1:39:52.320 --> 1:39:55.440]  so agi pie comes in and goes we're just going back to the way it was now it's
[1:39:55.440 --> 1:39:58.640]  got to be renegotiated stop saying i'm doing this and i read his quotes and
[1:39:58.640 --> 1:40:01.680]  what he's saying it's exactly what i'm saying and what i researched before he
[1:40:01.680 --> 1:40:06.880]  ever said it because it's true the guy is good
[1:40:06.880 --> 1:40:12.880]  soros ford foundation shovel 196 million to net neutrality groups
[1:40:12.880 --> 1:40:18.800]  staffed to the white house yep the death threats all of it to say net
[1:40:18.800 --> 1:40:22.800]  neutrality is over well watch you're going to be able to go to info wars.com
[1:40:22.800 --> 1:40:26.080]  unless you're on facebook twitter or google and they're blocking us remember
[1:40:26.080 --> 1:40:30.640]  soros said last week it's racist yes it's racist the guy that bankrupts
[1:40:30.640 --> 1:40:34.080]  countries third world country states control so remember agi pie
[1:40:34.080 --> 1:40:37.360]  he came out last week here's some of the quotes FCC chairman
[1:40:37.360 --> 1:40:41.120]  call silicon valley a bunch of hypocrites on net neutrality
[1:40:41.120 --> 1:40:45.920]  and he points out that tim cook of apple was the head of apple was in china last
[1:40:45.920 --> 1:40:48.640]  week working with the government for their vision
[1:40:48.640 --> 1:40:53.280]  to be brought into apple this is quotes from them you're with the communist
[1:40:53.280 --> 1:40:56.640]  chinese that kidnap buddhas for no reason
[1:40:56.640 --> 1:41:02.400]  and sell their organs i mean you know we're talking google level
[1:41:02.400 --> 1:41:07.120]  FCC chairman call silicon valley a bunch of hypocrites
[1:41:07.120 --> 1:41:10.400]  if these companies are truly committed to an open internet where americans can
[1:41:10.400 --> 1:41:13.360]  freely access the content of their choice like i am
[1:41:13.360 --> 1:41:16.720]  which curious that they focus on unnecessary and harmful regulation
[1:41:16.720 --> 1:41:20.400]  of other parts of the internet ecosystem with little history of engaging in
[1:41:20.400 --> 1:41:24.080]  this kind of behavior pie rights he calls out twitter for dis
[1:41:24.080 --> 1:41:29.040]  allowing pro-life messages they banned it by gop representative marcia blackburn
[1:41:29.040 --> 1:41:33.120]  campaign video in the end blackburn states i fought planned parenthood
[1:41:33.120 --> 1:41:36.800]  and we stopped the sale of body baby body parts which twitter immediately flagged
[1:41:36.800 --> 1:41:41.120]  as inflammatory twitter eventually relented and let the ad run of course
[1:41:41.120 --> 1:41:43.680]  had three million views they killed the viral spread
[1:41:43.680 --> 1:41:47.440]  pie also scolds youtube for removing videos from african-american trump

[1:47:28.720 --> 1:47:32.080]  against google against twitter against facebook
[1:47:32.080 --> 1:47:37.920]  so-called net neutrality was repealed just about 20 minutes ago by the fcc
[1:47:37.920 --> 1:47:40.800]  led by ozzie pie who's doing a great job in a vote
[1:47:40.800 --> 1:47:45.440]  three to two it's huge now i want to be clear
[1:47:45.440 --> 1:47:48.640]  because i've talked to top lawyers telecom experts on all sides in their
[1:47:48.640 --> 1:47:53.280]  offices in seattle dc meetings in austin texas because i'm i've
[1:47:53.280 --> 1:47:55.600]  said i've got to sue people so we're being censored
[1:47:55.600 --> 1:48:00.160]  project veritas caught it on video uh they have congressional hearings
[1:48:00.160 --> 1:48:02.560]  admitting it so i've got to do it and they keep
[1:48:02.560 --> 1:48:06.800]  explaining in the net neutrality legislation obama signed it's not net
[1:48:06.800 --> 1:48:10.000]  neutrality here's the section where it says they can censor you and they're
[1:48:10.000 --> 1:48:14.720]  giving liability protection that's what they're repealing now
[1:48:14.720 --> 1:48:18.160]  now there's got to be new bills when they're going to battle it doesn't mean
[1:48:18.160 --> 1:48:21.760]  that at&t isn't trying to place them hanky panky or time warner
[1:48:21.760 --> 1:48:25.440]  they're fighting with google facebook and twitter over control we now can have a
[1:48:25.440 --> 1:48:29.200]  real battle over net neutrality instead of obama
[1:48:29.200 --> 1:48:33.920]  and the un calling it net neutrality and trying to give full control of the un
[1:48:33.920 --> 1:48:38.160]  he didn't get the full control but they got partial
[1:48:38.160 --> 1:48:43.280]  now that's being repealed so it doesn't mean i'm siding with at&t
[1:48:43.280 --> 1:48:47.600]  or time warner don't care about any of us they want their own control of the web
[1:48:47.600 --> 1:48:51.120]  there's a fight over the future of the web but they said this was
[1:48:51.120 --> 1:48:55.360]  making it a utility okay and that they couldn't charge
[1:48:55.360 --> 1:49:00.640]  little guys more than big guys or vice versa folks
[1:49:00.640 --> 1:49:05.120]  they put censorship in here control monopolies all you've seen since this
[1:49:05.120 --> 1:49:08.960]  got in law a year ago is all hell break loose and censorship
[1:49:08.960 --> 1:49:14.960]  look around you so this is bad we just had a victory
[1:49:14.960 --> 1:49:18.640]  does it mean all the regulations are good absolutely not does it not mean
[1:49:18.640 --> 1:49:22.400]  that the big telecoms want to be big monopoly boys like google they're just
[1:49:22.400 --> 1:49:26.480]  not as new or as sophisticated they want to learn how to
[1:49:26.480 --> 1:49:32.800]  they're bad too but the misrepresentation
[1:49:32.800 --> 1:49:37.200]  that this is agi pie moving the ball backwards
[1:49:37.200 --> 1:49:41.120]  he just brought it back to where it was before obama did this
[1:49:41.120 --> 1:49:45.200]  so this is a big deal i've been in the lawyer's offices
[1:49:45.200 --> 1:49:49.040]  and then you've heard the guest on they bring up the subsection
[1:49:49.040 --> 1:49:52.880]  that the FCC is now going back on and it just says right there i mean
[1:49:52.880 --> 1:49:56.560]  this new FCC thing under obama before he left office they're just on implementing
[1:49:56.560 --> 1:49:59.840]  it'll prompt you said implement it said the FCC is over the internet
[1:49:59.840 --> 1:50:02.960]  it's over all transmissions it can censor people
[1:50:02.960 --> 1:50:08.000]  they had other members of the FCC say censor alex jones he's a russian agent
[1:50:08.000 --> 1:50:11.440]  take him off the air type that in outgoing
[1:50:11.440 --> 1:50:15.680]  head democrat on FCC says russia alex jones needs to be criminally
[1:50:15.680 --> 1:50:18.240]  investigated i mean you'll get mainstream news to
[1:50:18.240 --> 1:50:25.360]  talk about a lunatic the head democrat just says i'm a russian
[1:50:25.360 --> 1:50:29.040]  and just says shut me up
[1:50:29.840 --> 1:50:33.040]  but see they passed it and then trump came in
[1:50:33.040 --> 1:50:36.880]  and trump ignored it and now agi pie's a hero and and
[1:50:36.880 --> 1:50:42.080]  under death threats just did the right thing so we're back to where we were
[1:50:42.080 --> 1:50:44.880]  they taken us down a rat hole we're back up on the surface there it is
[1:50:44.880 --> 1:50:47.920]  alex jones he's under criminal espionage investigation for
[1:50:47.920 --> 1:50:50.960]  alleged russian ties that's the washington times scroll down it's got a

[1:52:28.480 --> 1:52:32.480]  that is a true american patriot uh and and uh
[1:52:32.480 --> 1:52:36.560]  lastly the good uh i was wondering if you might consider having a dr duke back
[1:52:36.560 --> 1:52:39.600]  on maybe for the end of the year and kind of get his take on all the new
[1:52:39.600 --> 1:52:43.360]  developments in the world today you're talking about david duke
[1:52:43.360 --> 1:52:48.720]  yes you know i tried to have david duke on to have a real discussion about
[1:52:48.720 --> 1:52:52.960]  not having race from racism from any angle and it just
[1:52:52.960 --> 1:52:56.400]  made people on all sides hate me his people hate me people that hate him
[1:52:56.400 --> 1:52:59.200]  hate me and it just turned into a train wreck but i think it'd be an interesting
[1:52:59.200 --> 1:53:01.840]  interview if you didn't just go off talking points whatever
[1:53:01.840 --> 1:53:04.800]  respond to what i was saying instead of claiming
[1:53:04.800 --> 1:53:07.760]  that i work for israel or i have some connection to israel it's just it's a
[1:53:07.760 --> 1:53:10.560]  script i've heard it before and it's not true it's not like i'm
[1:53:10.560 --> 1:53:14.160]  hold on i appreciate your call frank it's like i'm running from that or scared
[1:53:14.160 --> 1:53:19.920]  or it's some magical power like israelized freeze i'm tired of it
[1:53:19.920 --> 1:53:24.960]  because i know who i work for me the american people free market prosperity
[1:53:24.960 --> 1:53:28.960]  i love god i don't hate any group for what color they are where they came from
[1:53:28.960 --> 1:53:32.400]  but i'm gonna live my life and i'm promoting western civilization and i'm
[1:53:32.400 --> 1:53:36.080]  having big effects and we've all relaunched the american system
[1:53:36.080 --> 1:53:39.840]  we've rebooted it and that's what i'm doing and i want everybody to be part of
[1:53:39.840 --> 1:53:43.200]  it and to be part of prosperity so that's where i stand
[1:53:43.200 --> 1:53:45.520]  now if other groups are racist towards me i'll call them out and say they're
[1:53:45.520 --> 1:53:47.920]  racist and i'm i'll stand up for being you know
[1:53:47.920 --> 1:53:52.320]  my caucasian background uh and and and be proud of it but at the same time i
[1:53:52.320 --> 1:53:55.920]  just i'm so sick of it i mean take a look at the seven and a half
[1:53:55.920 --> 1:53:58.960]  billion people on this planet we've got to start really coming together we're
[1:53:58.960 --> 1:54:03.680]  going to kill each other and i believe renaissance free market capitalism
[1:54:03.680 --> 1:54:06.560]  with our christian ethos is the most successful system
[1:54:06.560 --> 1:54:11.120]  that's what i believe it's what i'm supporting but i i appreciate your call
[1:54:11.120 --> 1:54:15.520]  okay who's up next i'm gonna move try to move quick here uh chris in virginia
[1:54:15.520 --> 1:54:21.600]  you're on the air go ahead uh what she's seeing right now is a result
[1:54:21.600 --> 1:54:26.400]  of trump only having 20 of the government that is crazy right there in
[1:54:26.400 --> 1:54:30.000]  itself but him and fling came up with a plan
[1:54:30.000 --> 1:54:34.720]  when he knew that komi came in him with that fake uh ppga dossier
[1:54:34.720 --> 1:54:37.920]  they knew that the deep state was going to try to
[1:54:37.920 --> 1:54:41.760]  be slick and come at them and attack fling being
[1:54:41.760 --> 1:54:47.440]  wasn't he head of the b&r yeah obviously yeah defense intelligence agency
[1:54:47.440 --> 1:54:53.680]  so um you know he's uh in the counterintelligence so you think that
[1:54:53.680 --> 1:54:57.840]  he knew all the players he knew what was going on and knew how they were going
[1:54:57.840 --> 1:55:01.520]  to come at him so i think he's still on the floor for trump
[1:55:01.520 --> 1:55:04.960]  by the way he really did you know they offered general jones and others the
[1:55:04.960 --> 1:55:08.640]  position and they said listen flin's willing to take the heat
[1:55:08.640 --> 1:55:11.840]  and be attacked as a sacrificial lamb and now that you say it i think you
[1:55:11.840 --> 1:55:16.400]  should let them know that it they basically did set up the
[1:55:16.400 --> 1:55:19.440]  global state it it really is true i mean they didn't do it where
[1:55:19.440 --> 1:55:22.800]  they tried to do it they just knew what they would do and flin knew he was going
[1:55:22.800 --> 1:55:27.760]  in to directly be attacked to expose the whole thing it's funny you say that
[1:55:27.760 --> 1:55:32.080]  and now it puts the republicans in a situation where they have to give
[1:55:32.080 --> 1:55:36.640]  trump a win on tax reform they try to fight it they try to pull it out and

[1:55:46.480 --> 1:55:50.240]  have to bow down to trump now and with 20 percent of the government

[2:02:13.600 --> 2:02:17.360]  show for about a year now i'm only about 19 years old but
[2:02:17.360 --> 2:02:21.120]  welcome i'm originally from chicago i've moved to
[2:02:21.120 --> 2:02:25.920]  kansas city about uh i want to say six years ago
[2:02:25.920 --> 2:02:30.320]  but uh i want uh originally coming from chicago
[2:02:30.320 --> 2:02:33.920]  i wanted to ask you a question about uh
[2:02:33.920 --> 2:02:40.720]  uh really just uh jewish influence on marxism communism in today's society
[2:02:40.720 --> 2:02:45.360]  especially with today's society because to me it seems most prevalent in
[2:02:45.360 --> 2:02:49.040]  today's society especially since i've been reading
[2:02:49.040 --> 2:02:52.800]  about it a lot especially since 1920 when the franklin
[2:02:52.800 --> 2:02:58.800]  school was first uh made in germany in the 20s i believe it was well i mean
[2:02:58.800 --> 2:03:02.000]  undoubtedly that's that's in the history books that uh a lot of leftist jewish
[2:03:02.000 --> 2:03:05.280]  groups were heavily involved in communism but the big roberberg
[2:03:05.280 --> 2:03:08.960]  kind of financed it uh marx and engels because people are coming out of
[2:03:08.960 --> 2:03:11.680]  feudalism they wanted free market they wanted renaissance
[2:03:11.680 --> 2:03:14.800]  the industrial revolution was in full bloom so they kind of the globalist
[2:03:14.800 --> 2:03:19.600]  period a lot of groups were involved created a cosmology a world system of
[2:03:19.600 --> 2:03:23.200]  coming back into a commune but for your individual power which was
[2:03:23.200 --> 2:03:26.080]  kind of like zeitgeist is the modern movement with that guy with the fake
[2:03:26.080 --> 2:03:29.280]  name peter joseph whatever it is that the un and everybody pushes isn't the
[2:03:29.280 --> 2:03:32.560]  greatest thing you know we're gonna all live in these big cities and communes
[2:03:32.560 --> 2:03:36.160]  and these compact bubble cities and the computer will tell us what to do so
[2:03:36.160 --> 2:03:41.440]  we'll be free but who who programs the computer so a lot of this
[2:03:41.440 --> 2:03:46.000]  commune type stuff got picked up by communists that wrote about it kind of
[2:03:46.000 --> 2:03:49.840]  the model of some of these communal farms they have
[2:03:49.840 --> 2:03:53.200]  uh you know have in israel now but you can have a commune if it's like a
[2:03:53.200 --> 2:03:55.920]  hundred people and they all decide to go out in some religious group here at
[2:03:55.920 --> 2:03:59.760]  mormons or you know a seventh a adventist or jews or whatever it is
[2:03:59.760 --> 2:04:03.200]  when that's communes have been around a while but yeah there is a communal
[2:04:03.200 --> 2:04:08.640]  hits the term communism but a commune predates communism it just
[2:04:08.640 --> 2:04:12.720]  basically takes its name communism or communitarian from it and is a
[2:04:12.720 --> 2:04:16.320]  banker constructed system of ultra capitalists who are anti-free market
[2:04:16.320 --> 2:04:19.840]  and that's declassified appreciate your call interesting question

[2:06:03.120 --> 2:06:06.880]  those that we're already holding because mark dice is a great news hound historian
[2:06:06.880 --> 2:06:10.240]  media analyst you know got a degree in it but more importantly the degree in it
[2:06:10.240 --> 2:06:14.400]  in the last 20 years he's proven one of the top media analysts out there
[2:06:14.400 --> 2:06:18.320]  that's selling author researcher and of course you know famous
[2:06:18.320 --> 2:06:22.560]  famous commentary famous videos hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of
[2:06:22.560 --> 2:06:25.760]  millions of views got to be like a billion or something but i'm really
[2:06:25.760 --> 2:06:28.720]  excited about this book i never know what books are going to take off
[2:06:28.720 --> 2:06:32.160]  but when i got an introductory copy of this a couple months ago
[2:06:32.160 --> 2:06:36.240]  i read it and i said order a bunch of those but i hardly even sell books
[2:06:36.240 --> 2:06:39.360]  anymore i because you know we're just so focused on the news what we're doing i
[2:06:39.360 --> 2:06:44.560]  used to get books that i sold for every author you know that came on
[2:06:44.640 --> 2:06:47.840]  and i said listen we need to make this a major book we're going to push because
[2:06:47.840 --> 2:06:51.440]  this is perfect to wake up somebody on the fence
[2:06:51.440 --> 2:06:55.440]  or a liberal who's been brainwashed because it's
[2:06:55.440 --> 2:06:58.320]  chapters that are very easy to read but very well done
[2:06:58.320 --> 2:07:02.960]  and all bibliographed to understand the history of it how it happened
[2:07:02.960 --> 2:07:07.520]  why why it's collapsing right now and where we're going i mean it's just
[2:07:07.520 --> 2:07:11.760]  really a powerful book i read it in two days
[2:07:11.760 --> 2:07:15.680]  and usually i'm so busy now i might take me a week or two weeks to eat to read
[2:07:15.680 --> 2:07:18.560]  even a small book because i read like maybe a chapter at night you know at
[2:07:18.560 --> 2:07:22.000]  midnight and fall asleep i read the whole thing and on a weekend
[2:07:22.000 --> 2:07:25.600]  everybody needs to get the true story of fake news
[2:07:25.600 --> 2:07:29.920]  how mainstream media manipulates millions by mark dice and info wars store
[2:07:29.920 --> 2:07:34.560]  dot com or by calling toll free triple eight two five three three one three nine
[2:07:34.560 --> 2:07:39.760]  it went too close to the top of the charts with no promotion but then
[2:07:39.760 --> 2:07:43.360]  magically the censorship kicked in and i want to get his take on net
[2:07:43.360 --> 2:07:46.560]  neutrality too again we didn't have net neutrality
[2:07:46.560 --> 2:07:50.560]  obama called his legislation taking the web over net neutrality
[2:07:50.560 --> 2:07:53.840]  it inculcated censorship it doesn't mean the other telecoms
[2:07:53.840 --> 2:07:57.520]  don't want something just as bad there's a battle still going on
[2:07:57.520 --> 2:08:00.960]  obama won a big battle he lost the war today
[2:08:00.960 --> 2:08:04.400]  hopefully with pie but that's not decided yet so that's my take on that as
[2:08:04.400 --> 2:08:07.200]  well so uh it'll be your chance to talk to mark dice
[2:08:07.200 --> 2:08:10.560]  isa erin you can address your question to myself or or him
[2:08:10.560 --> 2:08:13.840]  and then others that want to get involved now after that specifically for mark
[2:08:13.840 --> 2:08:17.360]  dice the numbers eight seven seven seven eight nine alex eight seven seven
[2:08:17.360 --> 2:08:21.760]  seven eight nine alex because uh we got mark dice here with us for the

[2:08:25.280 --> 2:08:28.400]  want to get the book from him or i say don't get it in amazon even though it's
[2:08:28.400 --> 2:08:31.200]  fun to drive it up the top just because they're such globalist but
[2:08:31.200 --> 2:08:35.440]  regardless we're in an info war wake people up today
[2:08:35.440 --> 2:08:39.440]  so little books get read or handed out today that when you give somebody a book
[2:08:39.440 --> 2:08:43.040]  it's really important or buy it read it yourself give it to the library
[2:08:43.040 --> 2:08:46.240]  we're on average a donated book it's read over 200 times
[2:08:46.240 --> 2:08:49.920]  especially with a nice cover like this uh so again get the book today
[2:08:49.920 --> 2:08:52.560]  really excited about it the true story of fake news
[2:08:52.560 --> 2:08:57.120]  you know i got like 500 of these i want to order 10 000 of these
[2:08:57.120 --> 2:09:00.480]  i want to sell 100 000 of these it'll help find the operation wake people up
[2:09:00.480 --> 2:09:05.040]  mark's the great author great researcher it's important so mark uh
[2:09:05.040 --> 2:09:08.560]  you go through the history write to modern times you know you just reveal
[2:09:08.560 --> 2:09:12.960]  the stuff that's going on here uh all the things that are happening
[2:09:12.960 --> 2:09:18.720]  mark dice what do you want to tackle first dealing with the fake news
[2:09:18.720 --> 2:09:21.280]  well first of all thanks for having me alex i know a lot of people probably
[2:09:21.280 --> 2:09:24.640]  see me as sort of a comedic sarcastic youtuber or for my man on the
[2:09:24.640 --> 2:09:28.640]  street videos but i do have a serious side and the books are my my serious
[2:09:28.640 --> 2:09:32.160]  side and i was tracking you know what would ultimately become
[2:09:32.160 --> 2:09:36.320]  coined as fake news well well before the election writing a book about operation
[2:09:36.320 --> 2:09:39.520]  mockingbird the cia manipulation of the media
[2:09:39.520 --> 2:09:43.440]  and of course two weeks after the election they came up with their grand
[2:09:43.440 --> 2:09:48.560]  unified conspiracy umbrella under which all other conspiracies could fit as to
[2:09:48.560 --> 2:09:50.960]  why hillary clinton lost and that was the
[2:09:50.960 --> 2:09:54.800]  supposed fake news fiasco spreading through social media
[2:09:54.800 --> 2:09:58.960]  of course they frame the issue which is what they do they set the agenda
[2:09:58.960 --> 2:10:02.560]  that's one of the powers of the mainstream media so that it was only
[2:10:02.560 --> 2:10:06.560]  quote fake news about hillary clinton and that's why she lost the election when
[2:10:06.560 --> 2:10:10.400]  in reality big news was a two-way street fake news has
[2:10:10.400 --> 2:10:12.960]  spent around for hundreds of years fake news is
[2:10:12.960 --> 2:10:16.400]  has started wars the remember the main incident was
[2:10:16.400 --> 2:10:21.520]  hyped up by william randolph-hurst and the the Pulitzer's papers that's right
[2:10:21.520 --> 2:10:24.400]  fake news generally mainstream media didn't like to risk it a lot of they
[2:10:24.400 --> 2:10:27.040]  lost credibility but they would do it to launch a war
[2:10:27.040 --> 2:10:31.120]  the wmds you know the sinking of the main absolutely
[2:10:31.120 --> 2:10:35.120]  yeah the the real dangerous fake news doesn't come from some obscure
[2:10:35.120 --> 2:10:38.400]  websites or even websites that are attempting to mimic
[2:10:38.400 --> 2:10:44.240]  mainstream brand name websites like we saw in abc new abc.com.de website that
[2:10:44.240 --> 2:10:48.720]  was mimicking abc we saw in other similar sites that were designed
[2:10:48.720 --> 2:10:53.120]  to sort of look like you're popular in a brand name news channel and as you know
[2:10:53.120 --> 2:10:56.560]  big internet reports congressional reports and others admit fake news doesn't
[2:10:56.560 --> 2:10:59.680]  affect one percent it's total little sites don't
[2:10:59.680 --> 2:11:03.360]  things they label that but as you said the big governmental announcements of
[2:11:03.360 --> 2:11:06.480]  things that that the absolutely has an effect
[2:11:06.480 --> 2:11:10.720]  the most viral quote fake news stories during the election cycle
[2:11:10.720 --> 2:11:13.440]  most of them weren't even really fake news they were satire i mean what they
[2:11:13.440 --> 2:11:16.800]  were talking about stories like trump nominates
[2:11:16.800 --> 2:11:21.440]  um chris christie for supreme food court
[2:11:21.440 --> 2:11:26.240]  man yells alahu akbar before blowing up friends in box
[2:11:26.240 --> 2:11:30.160]  i mean it's it's like an onion style satire
[2:11:30.160 --> 2:11:34.800]  then they rolled this guy out named poll horner who admitted to being behind
[2:11:34.800 --> 2:11:37.440]  you know some of the more viral fake news stories which
[2:11:37.440 --> 2:11:40.640]  weren't even fake news to tarnish hillary clinton's image
[2:11:40.640 --> 2:11:45.360]  he was writing satire pieces trying to ridicule trump supporters
[2:11:45.360 --> 2:11:49.120]  making fun of them unfortunately some people some trump supporters did spread
[2:11:49.120 --> 2:11:51.520]  some of those stories because they only read the headline
[2:11:51.520 --> 2:11:54.800]  one of them you're probably familiar with is that
[2:11:54.800 --> 2:11:58.880]  anti-trump protesters were being paid and went to a school
[2:11:58.880 --> 2:12:01.680]  no i mean there's there's really truth to that i mean we know that george
[2:12:01.680 --> 2:12:04.640]  soros has paid tens of millions of dollars to black lives matter
[2:12:04.640 --> 2:12:09.120]  but this particular story sure they'll create a fake story to cover up something
[2:12:09.120 --> 2:12:12.400]  real going on where that specifics fake to cover up a real
[2:12:12.400 --> 2:12:14.880]  phenomena it's there's always a little bit of
[2:12:14.880 --> 2:12:17.680]  granted truth in there but in paul horner's stories you know one of the
[2:12:17.680 --> 2:12:22.400]  kingpins of of fake news after the first paragraph then it started to kind of
[2:12:22.400 --> 2:12:26.560]  go off into left field and you could be able to tell that it was a satire
[2:12:26.560 --> 2:12:30.640]  story but a lot of people in our you know instant gratification culture will
[2:12:30.640 --> 2:12:33.600]  share stories before even reading them they'll read a headline and they'll
[2:12:33.600 --> 2:12:37.280]  just think oh this is i know i've expected this to happen let me post it
[2:12:37.280 --> 2:12:40.080]  let me share it but then he comes out and says
[2:12:40.080 --> 2:12:43.600]  jokingly i think i helped elect president trump and then
[2:12:43.600 --> 2:12:47.200]  that was a headline over all of the the mainstream media he's trolling them
[2:12:47.200 --> 2:12:52.000]  but he's getting worse as trump exposes well just look at last week three
[2:12:52.000 --> 2:12:55.760]  giant fake stories i mean obviously you could talk about those you covered them
[2:12:55.760 --> 2:12:58.960]  i mean which one was the biggest
[2:12:58.960 --> 2:13:02.720]  yeah i would say cnn's blunder about getting the date wrong on these
[2:13:02.720 --> 2:13:06.800]  supposed wiki leaks documents that the trumpster campaign that they claimed
[2:13:06.800 --> 2:13:10.960]  had advanced knowledge of is probably the biggest blunder of this entire year
[2:13:10.960 --> 2:13:14.880]  i'm surprised that nobody got fired for that and thankfully we have a president
[2:13:14.880 --> 2:13:20.960]  who uses the modern day fireside chat which is what fdr would sit down with
[2:13:20.960 --> 2:13:24.480]  the american people and give them a direct radio address
[2:13:24.480 --> 2:13:28.480]  because before before radio i mean the only way you could actually hear a
[2:13:28.480 --> 2:13:32.080]  president speaking was to actually be in attendance
[2:13:32.080 --> 2:13:35.360]  and you had to rely on the newspapers and so radio started to become popular
[2:13:35.360 --> 2:13:38.640]  this is before television which you know didn't really become a household item
[2:13:38.640 --> 2:13:42.320]  until starting in the fifties but fdr would speak directly to the people
[2:13:42.320 --> 2:13:45.440]  with his popular fireside chat so trump's twitter
[2:13:45.440 --> 2:13:48.800]  is the modern day version of the fireside chat
[2:13:48.800 --> 2:13:51.760]  and so never before have we had a president that's
[2:13:51.760 --> 2:13:55.200]  willing and able to hit back against this fake news
[2:13:55.200 --> 2:13:58.080]  and they just keep digging their grave because
[2:13:58.080 --> 2:14:01.520]  every time they reach and jump to conclusions
[2:14:01.520 --> 2:14:06.800]  or perhaps are just reading into certain material
[2:14:06.800 --> 2:14:11.680]  through their bizarre warped paranoid lens they ultimately just end up looking
[2:14:11.680 --> 2:14:15.280]  more and more foolish just like when anderson cooper's twitter account tweeted
[2:14:15.280 --> 2:14:19.120]  out some derogatory response the president your loser your scumbag
[2:14:19.120 --> 2:14:23.600]  he says oh i didn't do that and even if it is plausible that his
[2:14:23.600 --> 2:14:27.440]  assistant did it from his phone but what they're saying is that it wasn't the
[2:14:27.440 --> 2:14:30.800]  assistant didn't did it thinking that he was logged in it was personal
[2:14:30.800 --> 2:14:33.040]  account a lot of these public figures have
[2:14:33.040 --> 2:14:36.640]  assistants that have access to their social media accounts or they have staff
[2:14:36.640 --> 2:14:40.000]  that have access and tweet for them obviously so it's plausible
[2:14:40.000 --> 2:14:43.440]  that you know somebody on staff tweeted thinking that they were on their
[2:14:43.440 --> 2:14:47.120]  personal account and tweeted you know irrespectively
[2:14:47.120 --> 2:14:51.280]  on unexpectedly on his they couldn't even admit that alex
[2:14:51.280 --> 2:14:55.760]  they said that while the assistant was logged in but then somebody at the gym
[2:14:55.760 --> 2:15:00.240]  stole his phone really so what they want is they want to do a stunt
[2:15:00.240 --> 2:15:04.240]  then have plausible deniability eat the cake and you know and and keep it too
[2:15:04.240 --> 2:15:08.000]  have the cake eat it too just like they did was saying general flin was
[2:15:08.000 --> 2:15:11.200]  basically a russian that trump ordered him during the campaign they knew that
[2:15:11.200 --> 2:15:14.320]  was fake to do a stunt and then they just suspend the guy for four weeks i mean
[2:15:14.320 --> 2:15:18.640]  they're doing this on purpose now trying to desperately when i want to ask you
[2:15:18.640 --> 2:15:21.600]  in these news wars how far will the fake news go
[2:15:21.600 --> 2:15:24.960]  because you've got fake onion stuff like you said that they try to say is the real
[2:15:24.960 --> 2:15:28.320]  issue and can compare us to while they're really the big corporate media

[2:20:00.480 --> 2:20:06.480]  the names in the middle
[2:20:06.480 --> 2:20:11.520]  the places where you used to be

[2:20:16.480 --> 2:20:19.840]  that's what the last so-called net neutrality bill was was they take over
[2:20:19.840 --> 2:20:22.720]  the internet you see massive censorship the whole of
[2:20:22.720 --> 2:20:26.400]  the subject they try to censor those of us in the real news
[2:20:26.400 --> 2:20:30.880]  while they force feed all their garbage that's their answer to
[2:20:30.880 --> 2:20:35.680]  dwindling readership and viewership the books
[2:20:35.680 --> 2:20:40.320]  really a must read it's 225 pages long
[2:20:40.320 --> 2:20:43.360]  it really should be university reading for people that are young journalism

[2:20:46.320 --> 2:20:49.920]  perspective of documents and missions case point examples of how
[2:20:49.920 --> 2:20:53.440]  fake news works what real fake news is we all know the big corporate media
[2:20:53.440 --> 2:20:56.240]  is the most fake out there i mean a lot of what they report on the visit
[2:20:56.240 --> 2:20:59.440]  political's real like there was a car crash here or this baseball team one
[2:20:59.440 --> 2:21:03.840]  there but when it's talking points that's when the real propaganda
[2:21:03.840 --> 2:21:07.360]  flows but the good news is they're propaganda so
[2:21:07.360 --> 2:21:11.440]  unified that rebooting americana promoting basic truths
[2:21:11.440 --> 2:21:14.880]  is so infectious in their system that we're winning
[2:21:14.880 --> 2:21:17.680]  so mark let me ask you this question just contemporarily even goes with the whole
[2:21:17.680 --> 2:21:20.400]  book where take some calls the next segment a lot of folks calling it talk to
[2:21:20.400 --> 2:21:22.720]  you
[2:21:22.720 --> 2:21:25.440]  what do you make of the whole russian narrative falling apart and now all
[2:21:25.440 --> 2:21:28.800]  these fbi people caught colluding and admitting their
[2:21:28.800 --> 2:21:32.320]  democrats in emails and stuff i mean they're in a lot of trouble as
[2:21:32.320 --> 2:21:35.760]  this whole thing seems to be coming apart faster
[2:21:35.760 --> 2:21:39.120]  they try to censor faster they try to get more oppressive
[2:21:39.120 --> 2:21:42.320]  but that doesn't seem to work where do you see the landscape of this going i
[2:21:42.320 --> 2:21:45.120]  mean they say a lot of things happen
[2:21:45.120 --> 2:21:48.640]  more in a year than happened the previous hundred when it comes to media
[2:21:48.640 --> 2:21:54.400]  and news and culture i think we're in that magic moment right now
[2:21:54.400 --> 2:21:58.480]  it looks like it's more than just fake news it was a well orchestrated
[2:21:58.480 --> 2:22:03.280]  fraud and a scam and we've seen you know similar less organized scams against
[2:22:03.280 --> 2:22:06.640]  trump again fake news is a two-way street it's not
[2:22:06.640 --> 2:22:09.840]  just fake news about hillary that cost for the election
[2:22:09.840 --> 2:22:14.080]  a lot of fake news about trump very well orchestrated fake news
[2:22:14.080 --> 2:22:17.360]  some of which was so inflammatory that some of the major networks didn't even
[2:22:17.360 --> 2:22:20.960]  carry it remember one 20th century fox and others got caught running
[2:22:20.960 --> 2:22:24.320]  hundreds of fake websites during the campaign that were anti-trump remember
[2:22:24.320 --> 2:22:28.160]  that abc news just had to pay 170
[2:22:28.160 --> 2:22:32.720]  million dollar fine for a defamation case because of a fake news story that they
[2:22:32.720 --> 2:22:36.880]  had been reporting on on the supposed pink slime about the beef industry
[2:22:36.880 --> 2:22:41.920]  that's almost an entire one-year profit that they had to pay because of fake
[2:22:41.920 --> 2:22:45.760]  news i mean we've seen over the past few decades
[2:22:45.760 --> 2:22:49.760]  not just fake news but fraud and scams nbc
[2:22:49.760 --> 2:22:53.440]  was sued by gentle motors back in the 90s making the cars blow up
[2:22:53.440 --> 2:22:57.920]  yeah they literally staged cars exploding to do a story about
[2:22:57.920 --> 2:23:01.920]  potentially defective gas tanks we've seen
[2:23:01.920 --> 2:23:07.760]  cbs recently and it's the audio about those facebook live
[2:23:07.760 --> 2:23:13.680]  torture suspects or perpetrators trying to portray it on cbs as if it was a
[2:23:13.680 --> 2:23:16.720]  bunch of white kids torturing a black kid because all they
[2:23:16.720 --> 2:23:20.000]  referenced donald trump nbc was sued after they
[2:23:20.000 --> 2:23:23.360]  doctored the audio i have to stop you that's so huge
[2:23:23.360 --> 2:23:26.720]  you got a bunch of black teens torturing a mentally retarded
[2:23:26.720 --> 2:23:30.400]  teenager cutting part of a scalp off the media first said it was fake
[2:23:30.400 --> 2:23:33.840]  that would never show it was a white kid being tortured by blacks live streaming
[2:23:33.840 --> 2:23:36.800]  and then turned it around and said they did it because they were white kids
[2:23:36.800 --> 2:23:41.760]  torturing a black kid because they love trump i mean that is next level
[2:23:41.760 --> 2:23:45.840]  that's fraud that's actually what the audio on the cbs report says
[2:23:45.840 --> 2:23:50.720]  is well it's they referenced donald trump and they called him the n word
[2:23:50.720 --> 2:23:54.720]  well that they referenced donald trump by saying you know f donald trump you
[2:23:54.720 --> 2:24:00.080]  voted for donald trump it's incredible we're gonna kill you in word doing
[2:24:00.080 --> 2:24:03.840]  and that's why in in my book the true story fake news there's a whole chapter
[2:24:03.840 --> 2:24:09.520]  on fake hate crimes because as we've seen the retraction gets maybe
[2:24:09.520 --> 2:24:13.760]  what five one percent five percent of the attention and we just saw the whole
[2:24:13.760 --> 2:24:18.240]  name we got the navy scroll we just saw the air force academy all fake
[2:24:18.240 --> 2:24:21.680]  and right after the election we saw a bunch of fake stories hoaxes coming out
[2:24:21.680 --> 2:24:24.720]  of people claiming that they were attacked by trump supporters
[2:24:24.720 --> 2:24:28.080]  a muslim woman claimed that she was assaulted by some trump supporters who
[2:24:28.080 --> 2:24:31.840]  stole her hijab almost every one of these big
[2:24:31.840 --> 2:24:35.600]  and market goes beyond that then hollywood and tv shows as you know
[2:24:35.600 --> 2:24:38.720]  i've seen it when i've been watching tv i just see ads everywhere
[2:24:38.720 --> 2:24:42.000]  white guys walking and beat up women and you know behind the counter to her
[2:24:42.000 --> 2:24:44.400]  jibs and then muslims are being attacked like
[2:24:44.400 --> 2:24:48.240]  in all these tv shows and none of it's real but to go with the fake news
[2:24:48.240 --> 2:24:52.080]  they've got hollywood and tv productions that show it's happening
[2:24:52.080 --> 2:24:55.600]  what do you call that like when fake news meets fake entertainment
[2:24:55.600 --> 2:24:59.680]  to prop up the facade well we call it the
[2:24:59.680 --> 2:25:05.040]  cia's entertainment uh liaison office which literally works with hollywood
[2:25:05.040 --> 2:25:07.200]  studios we've talked about this in the past
[2:25:07.200 --> 2:25:09.680]  many of the audience probably isn't familiar with this
[2:25:09.680 --> 2:25:13.920]  but the the department of defense different branches within the military
[2:25:13.920 --> 2:25:18.080]  and cia they literally have offices this is an open secret it's on the cia's
[2:25:18.080 --> 2:25:22.080]  website where they work with hollywood studios to make television shows and
[2:25:22.080 --> 2:25:25.920]  movies and that studios have to turn over script approval
[2:25:25.920 --> 2:25:30.560]  in order to get access to consultants in order to get access to equipment because
[2:25:30.560 --> 2:25:33.120]  let's face it if you're going to shoot top gun
[2:25:33.120 --> 2:25:37.200]  you can't just rent a bunch of jets in an aircraft carrier from somewhere you
[2:25:37.200 --> 2:25:39.760]  have to get permission from the military for that
[2:25:39.760 --> 2:25:42.560]  and so obviously they want the story to portray
[2:25:42.560 --> 2:25:45.760]  certain events in certain life well chris carter has come out and said that
[2:25:45.760 --> 2:25:50.080]  we're right uh specifically naming about the cia trying to control what they
[2:25:50.080 --> 2:25:53.280]  write they would come to him and try to get him to do stuff
[2:25:53.280 --> 2:25:56.400]  yeah people were really surprised about that and that well whatever you took
[2:25:56.400 --> 2:25:59.440]  from x files is being infiltrated by the cia
[2:25:59.440 --> 2:26:03.440]  well it's it's an open secret that government agencies work with hollywood
[2:26:03.440 --> 2:26:06.320]  studios and because you know we're talking a little bit
[2:26:06.320 --> 2:26:09.600]  about entertainment but but you know fake news propaganda
[2:26:09.600 --> 2:26:13.280]  entertainment it really is all in the same i was about to say they've got
[2:26:13.280 --> 2:26:17.440]  they've got five shows that currently are weekly or or or or daily
[2:26:17.440 --> 2:26:22.880]  that spoof elks jones homeland uh the opposition all these
[2:26:22.880 --> 2:26:27.840]  where they say it's alex jones then i say racist things but it's not me
[2:26:27.840 --> 2:26:30.880]  well let's not forget that there was actually a big hollywood movie
[2:26:30.880 --> 2:26:36.320]  about argo back in 2012 with ben afleck about the cia pretending to be a
[2:26:36.320 --> 2:26:40.560]  bunch of movie executives and movie studios for story in iran to
[2:26:40.560 --> 2:26:43.360]  to go over and get the hostages out of iran so
[2:26:43.360 --> 2:26:47.280]  we've seen the intelligence agencies working with hollywood studios
[2:26:47.280 --> 2:26:51.680]  for decades it's an open secret and television and movies
[2:26:51.680 --> 2:26:54.800]  they shape the culture i mean back in the 1980s
[2:26:54.800 --> 2:26:58.960]  shows like the cosby show and different strokes i mean those shows
[2:26:58.960 --> 2:27:03.920]  changed the way that america saw black families and interracial families and
[2:27:03.920 --> 2:27:08.080]  so this television it's a tool it can be used for good it can be used for bad
[2:27:08.080 --> 2:27:11.840]  so while those shows were were you know helping to show
[2:27:11.840 --> 2:27:15.280]  a different light a different part of society that most people haven't
[2:27:15.280 --> 2:27:19.520]  seen changing their you know preconceived notions about those kinds of things
[2:27:19.520 --> 2:27:26.080]  we also see entertainment using the the basic human psyche in order to twist
[2:27:26.080 --> 2:27:30.240]  the minds around and promote certain agendas early on they used it for a lot
[2:27:30.240 --> 2:27:33.520]  of good things and they got good people involved now it's pure
[2:27:33.520 --> 2:27:38.480]  race war christians are bad sexualized children there's no doubt now the folks
[2:27:38.480 --> 2:27:41.280]  running these unconstitutional programs are
[2:27:41.280 --> 2:27:46.160]  are bad people you know there's no coincidence that the show 24 came out
[2:27:46.160 --> 2:27:50.400]  right after 9 11 which had keith uh kiefer southern one torturing
[2:27:50.400 --> 2:27:53.840]  suspects to trying to condition people that that was a good thing
[2:27:53.840 --> 2:27:58.400]  we've seen even jessica chastain's film about hunting down bin laden
[2:27:58.400 --> 2:28:04.080]  when they portrayed a torture as having been one of the reasons why they got
[2:28:04.080 --> 2:28:08.640]  the information on the compound which was totally not true
[2:28:08.640 --> 2:28:13.200]  we've seen so many instances of hollywood movies
[2:28:13.200 --> 2:28:17.920]  used as propaganda tools this is all part of the the fake news industrial
[2:28:17.920 --> 2:28:20.320]  comp wow it's incredible and people should just
[2:28:20.320 --> 2:28:23.920]  get i know our audience is conscious but i i have to get conscious sometimes i

[2:33:17.840 --> 2:33:21.840]  you know my late great uncle would always say you can't
[2:33:21.840 --> 2:33:25.280]  cheat an honest man you can't con an honest man because they're not into weird
[2:33:25.280 --> 2:33:30.160]  flim flam operations or strange stuff and i was just
[2:33:30.160 --> 2:33:34.960]  thinking about the fact that cnn doesn't get it sometimes
[2:33:34.960 --> 2:33:38.560]  or msnbc they both had articles last week we covered them saying
[2:33:38.560 --> 2:33:43.360]  trump keeper of promises the other headline was like you know amateur
[2:33:43.360 --> 2:33:47.440]  trump keeps promises i mean i've seen hundreds of those the last year but
[2:33:47.440 --> 2:33:51.280]  there were a couple last week a couple on cnn and one on msnbc
[2:33:51.280 --> 2:33:54.320]  basically written by the same person it seemed like
[2:33:54.320 --> 2:33:57.680]  going look he's doing everything he said he was he's fighting hard and he's such an
[2:33:57.680 --> 2:34:02.320]  idiot i all these folks that never did anything but hijacked the country
[2:34:02.320 --> 2:34:06.400]  we can put those articles up just type in cnn.com searches there it is
[2:34:06.400 --> 2:34:10.240]  trumps promises and then the name of the headline when you click on it is
[2:34:10.240 --> 2:34:14.400]  trump keeper of promises so there's two different articles on cnn
[2:34:14.400 --> 2:34:20.000]  tpp 100 pipelines 90 percent negotiate nafta uh
[2:34:20.000 --> 2:34:26.080]  withdraw 80 the port millions of illegals 30 40 block syrian refugees 70
[2:34:26.080 --> 2:34:30.960]  percent repeal obamacare he's past half now halt muslims the u.s 70
[2:34:30.960 --> 2:34:33.520]  percent move the u.s embassy to jerusalem 50
[2:34:33.520 --> 2:34:37.440]  percent withdraw from paris climbing agreement 100 percent i mean
[2:34:37.440 --> 2:34:40.960]  how much easier is life when you just do what you say that's
[2:34:40.960 --> 2:34:43.920]  gosh i i might try to do what i say i'm gonna do it it's
[2:34:43.920 --> 2:34:48.160]  hard enough i couldn't imagine lying or shoved refuge or
[2:34:48.160 --> 2:34:51.280]  one of my biggest problems is even if i like somebody i'll tell them point blank
[2:34:51.280 --> 2:34:53.680]  what i think they're like what no one's ever talked to me like that you're
[2:34:53.680 --> 2:34:56.560]  really saying mean things i'm like no i'm just saying what i really think
[2:34:56.560 --> 2:35:00.800]  but that's on the other extreme you got people that lie on the other
[2:35:00.800 --> 2:35:04.400]  and just think it's the way the world works the book is the true story of
[2:35:04.400 --> 2:35:06.960]  fake news we're going back to him in a moment but
[2:35:06.960 --> 2:35:10.720]  speaking of trump he's on right now with a giant
[2:35:10.720 --> 2:35:14.960]  wall of regulations that they just cut that's a way to cut taxes by the way
[2:35:14.960 --> 2:35:17.760]  and it's already delivering let's play a few minutes of his live press conference
[2:35:17.760 --> 2:35:20.080]  here it is
[2:35:21.280 --> 2:35:25.520]  and then we will look at there was a big difference and we were going down
[2:35:25.520 --> 2:35:30.720]  this country was going economically down small business optimism is
[2:35:30.720 --> 2:35:36.000]  at its highest point in 34 years
[2:35:36.000 --> 2:35:41.600]  and we are just getting started we have decades of excess regulation to remove
[2:35:41.600 --> 2:35:46.000]  to help launch the next phase of growth prosperity and freedom
[2:35:46.000 --> 2:35:50.080]  i am challenging my cabinet to find and remove every single outdated
[2:35:50.080 --> 2:35:54.560]  unlawful and excessive regulation currently on the books
[2:35:54.560 --> 2:35:59.280]  i want every cabinet secretary agency head and federal worker to push even
[2:35:59.280 --> 2:36:03.200]  harder to cut even more regulations
[2:36:03.200 --> 2:36:07.120]  in 2018 and that should just about do it
[2:36:07.120 --> 2:36:11.760]  i don't know if we'll have any left to cut but we'll always find them
[2:36:11.760 --> 2:36:16.320]  we must liberate our economy from years of federal overreach
[2:36:16.320 --> 2:36:20.400]  and intrusion so that we can compete and win on the world's
[2:36:20.400 --> 2:36:23.520]  by the way in private same guy when you look at the stock market and what's
[2:36:23.520 --> 2:36:27.760]  happening such a high level i'm going to elix i want you to go
[2:36:27.760 --> 2:36:30.560]  much of that is because of what we've done with
[2:36:30.560 --> 2:36:34.400]  regulation impossible example the current process for permitting
[2:36:34.400 --> 2:36:39.120]  infrastructure is just recorded on the placement with rap for coming up
[2:36:39.120 --> 2:36:42.080]  we got mark dice here with us i'm going to go to calls here in a moment mark but
[2:36:42.080 --> 2:36:45.760]  other big tidbits you just heard the point i made about
[2:36:45.760 --> 2:36:49.360]  they admit he's telling the truth he's horrible but he's a russian agent even
[2:36:49.360 --> 2:36:51.680]  though they've been caught trying to frame him i mean if they're going to try
[2:36:51.680 --> 2:36:55.920]  to remove a president who is literally bringing the country back from the dead
[2:36:55.920 --> 2:36:59.120]  that doesn't sound like a very smart political move but instead they're
[2:36:59.120 --> 2:37:02.800]  betting it all this male versus female crap
[2:37:02.800 --> 2:37:06.000]  two weeks after the 2016 election is when the fake news
[2:37:06.000 --> 2:37:09.280]  you know phenomenon really blew up and then literally two weeks later the
[2:37:09.280 --> 2:37:12.560]  washington post which really was the first to start the fake news
[2:37:12.560 --> 2:37:15.680]  uh witch hunt and tie it to the supposed russians
[2:37:15.680 --> 2:37:19.120]  two weeks later then they admitted that the war against fake news
[2:37:19.120 --> 2:37:22.800]  has backfired and this was the first year really
[2:37:22.800 --> 2:37:26.720]  they said stop using it singing in came on and said stop stop we
[2:37:26.720 --> 2:37:31.520]  no no i'm done you know everything that they're doing is only backfiring if they
[2:37:31.520 --> 2:37:35.200]  would actually just criticize the president for legitimate criticisms
[2:37:35.200 --> 2:37:38.320]  and if the democrats had put out you know reasonable
[2:37:38.320 --> 2:37:42.080]  you know policy discussions none of this would be happening but
[2:37:42.080 --> 2:37:46.080]  this was the first election where social media played a huge role
[2:37:46.080 --> 2:37:50.080]  social media wasn't just a place to post you know pictures of what you were
[2:37:50.080 --> 2:37:53.200]  having for dinner youtube wasn't just a place to post
[2:37:53.200 --> 2:37:56.960]  funny cat videos or you know funny video of you know somebody uh
[2:37:56.960 --> 2:38:00.800]  you know falling off their bike and getting hurt a a fail video
[2:38:00.800 --> 2:38:05.520]  this was the first year really when social media was used as a powerful tool
[2:38:05.520 --> 2:38:09.280]  by people like me people like you and they admitted that fired and zuckerberg
[2:38:09.280 --> 2:38:14.160]  said i promise i'll start censoring now initially they said well fake news had
[2:38:14.160 --> 2:38:17.440]  nothing to do with it we don't think so there's you know hoaxes spread through
[2:38:17.440 --> 2:38:21.760]  facebook sometimes they've spread since you know it started i mean we all
[2:38:21.760 --> 2:38:26.400]  remember some of the earlier hoaxes about posting a comment about
[2:38:26.400 --> 2:38:30.240]  opting out of one of their new you know terms of service and then everyone
[2:38:30.240 --> 2:38:33.680]  starts so hoaxes have spread through facebook since the beginning
[2:38:33.680 --> 2:38:37.760]  but there's been studies that have been done by stanford new york university
[2:38:37.760 --> 2:38:40.320]  that the fake news that was spread through facebook
[2:38:40.320 --> 2:38:44.240]  didn't change anybody's opinion in fact most people clicked on it
[2:38:44.240 --> 2:38:48.880]  just out of curiosity and because of the clickbait titles and so it might have
[2:38:48.880 --> 2:38:51.760]  driven some traffic to some of these websites that might have gotten them
[2:38:51.760 --> 2:38:54.640]  some money but nobody was really duped very few
[2:38:54.640 --> 2:38:57.600]  people in fact some people were but very few were actually
[2:38:57.600 --> 2:39:01.840]  it's a hoax to say that that that independent grassroots fake news
[2:39:01.840 --> 2:39:05.840]  david trump we had google facebook twitter the e u the globalist hollywood
[2:39:05.840 --> 2:39:08.960]  mainstream media all the money you know 10 to 1
[2:39:08.960 --> 2:39:12.480]  thrown against trump american people they lost so where do you see this going
[2:39:12.480 --> 2:39:17.040]  now mark they've had their candy butts handed to them
[2:39:17.040 --> 2:39:19.760]  i think the manipulation is going to get a little bit more slick we're probably
[2:39:19.760 --> 2:39:24.000]  going to see twitter continue to roll out new manipulations on the trending
[2:39:24.000 --> 2:39:28.080]  new stricter terms of service are rolling out about certain symbols and
[2:39:28.080 --> 2:39:31.440]  terms that you're not supposed to use and it's all selectively enforced keep
[2:39:31.440 --> 2:39:35.280]  overwhelming can say murder trump murder every murder murder we call
[2:39:35.280 --> 2:39:39.200]  somebody a liar of their band or trump trump trump says that
[2:39:39.200 --> 2:39:43.360]  don lemon is is is stupid and they go oh it's bullying
[2:39:43.360 --> 2:39:46.720]  you can't say a public figure that's attacking you and calling you evil is
[2:39:46.720 --> 2:39:51.760]  dumb he can attack don lemon can attack but you're not allowed to call him dumb
[2:39:51.760 --> 2:39:55.600]  and of course none of the threats against the president trump or against
[2:39:55.600 --> 2:39:58.880]  white people none of the racist you know slurs that are
[2:39:58.880 --> 2:40:02.160]  spread about white people on twitter are going to make it into a mainstream
[2:40:02.160 --> 2:40:06.000]  liberal establishment but if president obama had
[2:40:06.000 --> 2:40:09.520]  even one percent of the amount of online threats that trump got
[2:40:09.520 --> 2:40:14.160]  after he was elected and then again which erupted on the day of inauguration
[2:40:14.160 --> 2:40:17.280]  it would have been national news there would have been dozens of arrests
[2:40:17.280 --> 2:40:20.560]  these suspects would have been tatted out on the national
[2:40:20.560 --> 2:40:24.160]  scene and shown to the whole country to the whole world
[2:40:24.160 --> 2:40:28.560]  there wasn't even a wikipedia page specifically for assassination threats
[2:40:28.560 --> 2:40:33.360]  against trump until recently there was a page or still is rather
[2:40:33.360 --> 2:40:37.840]  a page dedicated to threats about obama but at the time that my book came out
[2:40:37.840 --> 2:40:41.040]  just last month or when i was writing it when it's getting finished to getting
[2:40:41.040 --> 2:40:44.640]  ready to publish it there was not a page dedicated or even a
[2:40:44.640 --> 2:40:48.000]  section on trump's twitter or a wikipedia page
[2:40:48.000 --> 2:40:50.960]  about the death threats even though there were tens of thousands of them on
[2:40:50.960 --> 2:40:53.280]  twitter no there's another question mark i want your
[2:40:53.280 --> 2:40:56.640]  take on this we're gonna break go to calls they'll call
[2:40:56.640 --> 2:40:59.920]  hashtag republicans they'll say good kill republicans they'll call for it the
[2:40:59.920 --> 2:41:03.120]  new york times washington post and then when we talk about here's a full page
[2:41:03.120 --> 2:41:06.640]  ad for the overthrow of trump and you know by by anti-fudge words they go
[2:41:06.640 --> 2:41:10.560]  jones is insane no one's plotting any violence and then when it's a dud they
[2:41:10.560 --> 2:41:14.000]  say we just made it up so they want to launch their attacks but then deny
[2:41:14.000 --> 2:41:17.280]  they're happening i don't remember who said it but
[2:41:17.280 --> 2:41:20.800]  there's an old saying that they you know lie can make it halfway around the
[2:41:20.800 --> 2:41:24.880]  world before the truth puts its shoes on in the morning and that's why
[2:41:24.880 --> 2:41:28.000]  that's why they keep putting out these ridiculous fake stories because they
[2:41:28.000 --> 2:41:31.440]  know that it's going to reinforce that's what they're trying to do is trying to
[2:41:31.440 --> 2:41:35.200]  reinforce what they've already put out there that trump is bad that this is a
[2:41:35.200 --> 2:41:39.920]  a fascist regime and so when they have to issue retractions or apologies
[2:41:39.920 --> 2:41:43.120]  cnn doesn't even do it on the main twitter account they have a special
[2:41:43.120 --> 2:41:46.960]  twitter account cnn no so you're allowed to kidnap and murder children as long as
[2:41:46.960 --> 2:41:50.480]  you apologize to an empty room it's okay it's a get out of jail
[2:41:50.480 --> 2:41:53.840]  free card yeah and so that's what they're doing
[2:41:53.840 --> 2:41:57.760]  they're they're they're reinforcing this already insane ideology that they've
[2:41:57.760 --> 2:42:01.120]  whipped up the the retractions get no footing nobody
[2:42:01.120 --> 2:42:04.880]  hears about the retractions and also i think what they're trying to do is to
[2:42:04.880 --> 2:42:08.160]  get the short-term gains of the clicks to their website so we need to really
[2:42:08.160 --> 2:42:11.840]  stop posting some of their insane articles
[2:42:11.840 --> 2:42:14.640]  to show people what they're doing a lot of people will post an article on
[2:42:14.640 --> 2:42:18.320]  facebook and say look at what this ridiculous cnn article is saying
[2:42:18.320 --> 2:42:21.680]  they don't stop doing that because then you're just driving more traffic to
[2:42:21.680 --> 2:42:25.280]  their website post a screenshot or just talk about it exactly they're like
[2:42:25.280 --> 2:42:28.640]  trolling us now with the insanity using our names
[2:42:28.640 --> 2:42:31.520]  to do it great point mark dice like the end of the book you just say
[2:42:31.520 --> 2:42:36.560]  turn it all off you've got a plan i agree with to shut them down once and for all

[2:46:43.680 --> 2:46:45.680]  you
[2:46:56.160 --> 2:47:00.000]  from the front lines of the information war
[2:47:00.000 --> 2:47:03.600]  it's mark dice from southern california
[2:47:03.600 --> 2:47:07.040]  i'm alex jones your host we're broadcasting worldwide i'll be
[2:47:07.040 --> 2:47:10.320]  hosting a john raport coming up bunch of clips news i haven't gotten to
[2:47:10.320 --> 2:47:13.360]  yet loaded phone lines for mark we really shouldn't cheat these folks and let
[2:47:13.360 --> 2:47:16.400]  them talk to mark we'll do that to a matt
[2:47:16.400 --> 2:47:23.360]  and meld and salvador and others here in just a moment but mark i want your
[2:47:23.360 --> 2:47:26.240]  real take on this i know you'll give it your real news take but
[2:47:26.240 --> 2:47:30.880]  i've tried to study net neutrality try to study all this it's very complex but
[2:47:30.880 --> 2:47:34.400]  bottom line obama had a big web takeover it's horrible calling it net
[2:47:34.400 --> 2:47:38.800]  neutrality agi pie's reversing it so now there's a new fight
[2:47:38.800 --> 2:47:42.080]  as other telecoms fight with big tech giants
[2:47:42.080 --> 2:47:46.240]  to try to take it over so there's not good sides on either side there
[2:47:46.240 --> 2:47:49.200]  but pie did just take it back to where it was
[2:47:49.200 --> 2:47:52.640]  before obama tried to hand it over to the globalist and kick off this giant
[2:47:52.640 --> 2:47:57.360]  censorship operation and give telecoms but also big tech giants the right to
[2:47:57.360 --> 2:48:00.880]  censor people mark what do you think about that
[2:48:00.880 --> 2:48:04.480]  yeah there are some strong arguments on both sides i think that
[2:48:04.480 --> 2:48:08.240]  many people on both sides of the issue are getting a little bit too
[2:48:08.240 --> 2:48:12.480]  hyped up and a little bit too concerned i'm all for undoing almost anything that
[2:48:12.480 --> 2:48:16.240]  obama did we know that he turned what basically turned the united the entire
[2:48:16.240 --> 2:48:20.640]  internet over to the united nation exactly and a lot of this
[2:48:20.640 --> 2:48:24.320]  these big tech companies gobbling up smaller companies
[2:48:24.320 --> 2:48:28.000]  a lot of this happens most of this and what's called the sun valley conference
[2:48:28.000 --> 2:48:32.240]  which is bill de berg for tech and this is a annual media conference that
[2:48:32.240 --> 2:48:37.440]  happens every july in sun valley idaho not in new york city not in
[2:48:37.440 --> 2:48:41.280]  los angeles all the tech companies and media moguls
[2:48:41.280 --> 2:48:45.440]  go to the small little town of 1500 people every summer since
[2:48:45.440 --> 2:48:49.440]  1983 this is where they put on the the auctioning
[2:48:49.440 --> 2:48:53.200]  block all these smaller little media companies and decide
[2:48:53.200 --> 2:48:56.160]  which ones they're going to buy up who's going to merge with who
[2:48:56.160 --> 2:48:59.760]  what the coming terms of service are going to be this isn't just
[2:48:59.760 --> 2:49:03.280]  this is where they collude like the oil companies got caught in the 70s
[2:49:03.280 --> 2:49:06.960]  fixing prices this is where they collude on what they're going to do lobbying
[2:49:06.960 --> 2:49:12.800]  wise to get stuff done in congress this is where microsoft merged with
[2:49:12.800 --> 2:49:16.960]  nbc to create msnbc this is where facebook purchased
[2:49:16.960 --> 2:49:20.800]  instagram this is where most of the big major
[2:49:20.800 --> 2:49:24.480]  telemarketing or telecom this is where you know they talked a year ago
[2:49:24.480 --> 2:49:29.600]  about where disney would buy news a news corps this is where google's
[2:49:29.600 --> 2:49:34.320]  initial ipo was was just was settled and organized
[2:49:34.320 --> 2:49:37.680]  this is where also the head of the cia usually goes
[2:49:37.680 --> 2:49:41.200]  or former cia official and what is it happening is we need to send reporters
[2:49:41.200 --> 2:49:44.400]  this is the digital bilderberg that you keep harping on that i should
[2:49:44.400 --> 2:49:47.760]  pay attention to yes it happens every july usually
[2:49:47.760 --> 2:49:51.440]  about the the first week into why don't we both go this
[2:49:51.440 --> 2:49:55.360]  year you can go with us i'll finance you going mark
[2:49:55.360 --> 2:49:59.120]  we that's definitely a possibility we need to one of the other issues of the
[2:49:59.120 --> 2:50:02.400]  of you know fake news it's not just lying it's actually
[2:50:02.400 --> 2:50:06.560]  lying by omission exactly why these big media companies
[2:50:06.560 --> 2:50:10.240]  prevent certain issues certain topics from making it in the mainstream that's
[2:50:10.240 --> 2:50:13.280]  why the bilderberg group is has never really been
[2:50:13.280 --> 2:50:17.520]  mainstream news only with social media and with you and with the drudge
[2:50:17.520 --> 2:50:23.280]  covering it has it been mentioned as soon as it got exposed it lost its power
[2:50:23.280 --> 2:50:27.120]  it even if it was mentioned it was usually on some small little article at
[2:50:27.120 --> 2:50:30.640]  the bottom of the page on the website it certainly didn't lead or it wasn't
[2:50:30.640 --> 2:50:34.000]  even mark you remember even 10 years ago you've been doing this 15 60 and i
[2:50:34.000 --> 2:50:36.960]  remember they would say it didn't exist remember that
[2:50:36.960 --> 2:50:40.320]  yeah we're conspiracy theorists for talking about this and and thinking
[2:50:40.320 --> 2:50:44.320]  what these big moguls meet now look it's an interesting story when you have a
[2:50:44.320 --> 2:50:47.680]  hundred of the world's most powerful men in variety of different sectors from
[2:50:47.680 --> 2:50:51.440]  politics and banking and media all meeting together that's a story
[2:50:51.440 --> 2:50:55.280]  that's an interesting collusion i mean it violates the Logan act exactly mark
[2:50:55.280 --> 2:50:58.080]  dyson our guest the new book the true story of fake news

[2:51:35.920 --> 2:51:41.440]  mat in pennsylvania i'm gonna go to salvatore and mellow d go ahead
[2:51:41.440 --> 2:51:45.200]  hey guys can you hear me yes sir hey so
[2:51:45.200 --> 2:51:49.200]  more people need to rise up and get involved with grassroots journalism
[2:51:49.200 --> 2:51:53.120]  and that's what we're doing in handover pennsylvania with the daily informer
[2:51:53.120 --> 2:51:56.320]  so i called her a couple times before and we have we have a little a little
[2:51:56.320 --> 2:51:58.960]  blog that i share with you the daily informer.net we just pretty much
[2:51:58.960 --> 2:52:02.080]  aggregate share a bunch of your guys's articles and stuff
[2:52:02.080 --> 2:52:05.200]  so what we're doing locally it's really unique and it lists up small
[2:52:05.200 --> 2:52:08.240]  businesses a lot and it really helps small businesses and promote them and
[2:52:08.240 --> 2:52:11.520]  all and it's a really cool thing and we want to show more people how to do it
[2:52:11.520 --> 2:52:15.040]  so more people in different parts of the country can can can get involved
[2:52:15.040 --> 2:52:18.400]  because i think a lot of reason why people don't get involved is because
[2:52:18.400 --> 2:52:23.280]  i totally agree how do we get locals involved in national and local news
[2:52:23.280 --> 2:52:28.160]  and help make businesses money being part of having new digital local papers
[2:52:28.160 --> 2:52:31.360]  filling the gaps of local papers that are establishment run
[2:52:31.360 --> 2:52:34.320]  that's something we're looking at so we'll get your name and number i want
[2:52:34.320 --> 2:52:38.320]  to talk to you because funding for independent media we have the audiences
[2:52:38.320 --> 2:52:42.000]  but then how do we get the funding is that what you're getting at matt
[2:52:42.000 --> 2:52:45.680]  it is yeah and it's like it's it's really unique and like
[2:52:45.680 --> 2:52:49.120]  matt i'm going to put you on hold i'm going to get your number to tim purge
[2:52:49.120 --> 2:52:52.560]  i'll talk to you tomorrow i want to hear about this mark that's a big issue
[2:52:52.560 --> 2:52:56.080]  funding i mean you may reach a million plus people
[2:52:56.080 --> 2:52:59.280]  you know every day or so on your youtube with a million subscribers just part of
[2:52:59.280 --> 2:53:02.720]  what you do and i may reach you that or whatever that's part of what we do but
[2:53:02.720 --> 2:53:06.240]  if they don't financially just do something every once in a while
[2:53:06.240 --> 2:53:10.240]  we can't fund what we're doing or expanding i mean mark i'd love to see you
[2:53:10.240 --> 2:53:14.000]  with 30 crew members i mean it'd be awesome i want to see
[2:53:14.000 --> 2:53:16.720]  what real people that aren't globalists would do
[2:53:16.720 --> 2:53:20.400]  with a larger media operation because there's a one-man show or a two-man show
[2:53:20.400 --> 2:53:24.400]  you're already kicking ass thanks bro it's been a pleasure to watch your
[2:53:24.400 --> 2:53:28.000]  operation grow over the last 10 12 years since i've been part of the show it's
[2:53:28.000 --> 2:53:30.880]  amazing and that's one of the reasons why they're coming after all of us
[2:53:30.880 --> 2:53:34.400]  financially is with with the youtube adpocalypse
[2:53:34.400 --> 2:53:38.240]  with preventing videos from being monetized my youtube channel was making
[2:53:38.240 --> 2:53:41.120]  more money when i had literally one tenth of the
[2:53:41.120 --> 2:53:45.040]  subscribers as as it is now because almost everything that's
[2:53:45.040 --> 2:53:48.960]  uploaded their ai goes through the transcript which is generated
[2:53:48.960 --> 2:53:52.800]  and they find certain keywords and so they take the demonetization
[2:53:52.800 --> 2:53:55.760]  uh the revenue streams away and that's one of their
[2:53:55.760 --> 2:53:59.360]  what we know one of their tools one of their weapons against us is trying to
[2:53:59.360 --> 2:54:02.960]  hurt us financially just like they can instantly in a millisecond scan the
[2:54:02.960 --> 2:54:06.800]  whole video for keywords and decide to monetize or not monetize
[2:54:06.800 --> 2:54:09.760]  that they now admit with elect said all these systems they're doing it in your
[2:54:09.760 --> 2:54:11.920]  house you don't own cats but if you joke
[2:54:11.920 --> 2:54:14.480]  about cats you get cat food ads it's confirmed
[2:54:14.480 --> 2:54:19.600]  they're listening to you you know i was putting out youtube videos for i think
[2:54:19.600 --> 2:54:23.440]  six years before i even made a penny off of them before the channel was even
[2:54:23.440 --> 2:54:26.400]  monetized because it was the passion because i just wanted to get the
[2:54:26.400 --> 2:54:29.760]  information out there with the new tools that were available they banned you a
[2:54:29.760 --> 2:54:32.560]  couple times they deleted the whole channel they've
[2:54:32.560 --> 2:54:36.640]  had videos of mine pulled down i have to appeal them it's it's a constant it's
[2:54:36.640 --> 2:54:40.320]  constantly under threat but what's so interesting about this
[2:54:40.320 --> 2:54:43.600]  last election cycle and even you know 2017
[2:54:43.600 --> 2:54:47.440]  the trump supporters the trump train we didn't we didn't fall asleep at the
[2:54:47.440 --> 2:54:50.160]  wheel we didn't kind of go back into our you know
[2:54:50.160 --> 2:54:53.680]  regular mode we're getting more engaged and that's why they that's why they're
[2:54:53.680 --> 2:54:57.120]  so upset and and what you just said we're not complaining we want to win
[2:54:57.120 --> 2:55:01.600]  we're not winers we're not sjw's but behind every big channel is hell
[2:55:01.600 --> 2:55:04.800]  is war he's having all your money cut off is being harassed
[2:55:04.800 --> 2:55:07.680]  is being stuff i can't even get into on air at my level
[2:55:07.680 --> 2:55:11.760]  understand it's not just oh a video you see somebody lost their job
[2:55:11.760 --> 2:55:15.600]  somebody lost their wife somebody got harassed somebody got their house shot
[2:55:15.600 --> 2:55:18.880]  up somebody had people come out their family i mean this is a war
[2:55:18.880 --> 2:55:22.080]  the good news is i think we're starting to win though mark
[2:55:22.080 --> 2:55:25.760]  it is and we don't talk about a lot of the you know some of the bad side that
[2:55:25.760 --> 2:55:28.480]  comes with this job because we don't want to highlight it we don't want to
[2:55:28.480 --> 2:55:31.440]  encourage other people we just want to keep going straight forward but it is a
[2:55:31.440 --> 2:55:35.920]  difficult position and when we see the attacks that are coming against us
[2:55:35.920 --> 2:55:40.000]  personally financially legally but i've noticed you've gone from being pretty
[2:55:40.000 --> 2:55:43.520]  good to super hardcore under attack that i mean i'm i never talked about this
[2:55:43.520 --> 2:55:46.960]  personally but is that what's made you a lot more hardcore and focused is that
[2:55:46.960 --> 2:55:50.720]  you run through a lot of hell i think it's made me a lot stronger i
[2:55:50.720 --> 2:55:53.680]  think that that's you know sort of going through the fire
[2:55:53.680 --> 2:55:58.480]  it just solidifies me it's the pressure has turned me into a into a diamond so
[2:55:58.480 --> 2:56:01.760]  to speak and it just every time they try to come at me
[2:56:01.760 --> 2:56:04.320]  thinking that they're going to scare me that they're going to slow me down
[2:56:04.320 --> 2:56:07.840]  i just keep going and i'll highlight the the issues i'll highlight the
[2:56:07.840 --> 2:56:11.200]  censorship some of the stuff i don't talk about it's taken care of
[2:56:11.200 --> 2:56:15.520]  you know behind the scenes but it's it's a it's a tough battle
[2:56:15.520 --> 2:56:18.720]  and we see the mainstream media people need to know that
[2:56:18.720 --> 2:56:22.000]  he's talking heads on television are millionaires i mean joe scarborough
[2:56:22.000 --> 2:56:25.920]  was making a hundred thousand dollars a week according to his divorce documents

[3:02:32.000 --> 3:02:35.600]  san diego i've seen the i've seen the videos of mark dice you know the
[3:02:35.600 --> 3:02:39.600]  ocean side pier i believe yep if i'm right
[3:02:39.600 --> 3:02:44.960]  but um i just i just hope that material like this like the book that you are
[3:02:44.960 --> 3:02:50.160]  that you that you wrote uh can can be translated into spanish
[3:02:50.160 --> 3:02:54.160]  because i believe there's uh well we you know there's uh
[3:02:54.160 --> 3:02:58.000]  there needs to be an outreach to the community um immigrant community here
[3:02:58.000 --> 3:03:00.800]  i totally spanish is probably the biggest language in the world now other
[3:03:00.800 --> 3:03:04.480]  than english or chinese it's one of the big three we we all need to have
[3:03:04.480 --> 3:03:07.200]  because i found people that speak spanish is one of the most
[3:03:07.200 --> 3:03:11.200]  awake hungry groups out there that's a great point mark dice
[3:03:11.200 --> 3:03:14.560]  they're very family oriented as well they're very traditional very you know
[3:03:14.560 --> 3:03:17.840]  very very conservative obviously there's some issues that some of them have with
[3:03:17.840 --> 3:03:21.120]  trump's immigration policy but they're they're fantastic people and i hope
[3:03:21.120 --> 3:03:23.920]  people check out the book it's a lot more serious of a side
[3:03:23.920 --> 3:03:28.160]  than my you know a lot of my videos and it's really the entire
[3:03:28.160 --> 3:03:32.080]  history of fake news which goes beyond uh you know just in the last year i mean
[3:03:32.080 --> 3:03:36.080]  it's hundreds of years old and a lot of examples of the power of propaganda
[3:03:36.080 --> 3:03:39.760]  the building mountains out of mohills how the media functions
[3:03:39.760 --> 3:03:43.120]  the mechanisms that work some of these organizations that
[3:03:43.120 --> 3:03:47.040]  are working behind the scenes and so you know i always enjoy coming on with the
[3:03:47.040 --> 3:03:50.080]  alex because people can kind of see a more more serious side to me
[3:03:50.080 --> 3:03:54.880]  yeah you're doing it all your videos are great uh salvo or anything else
[3:03:54.880 --> 3:03:59.440]  i guess like i said i mean i just uh i was down there in bahia and i can't
[3:03:59.440 --> 3:04:01.920]  believe we were talking about the alex jones channel
[3:04:01.920 --> 3:04:06.880]  and uh in bahia i think i'm at a bar but yes i mean hopefully we can do an
[3:04:06.880 --> 3:04:09.520]  outreach to those people because i believe we're one of the most
[3:04:09.520 --> 3:04:14.000]  exploitative communities when it comes to democrats absolutely salvador we need
[3:04:14.000 --> 3:04:16.640]  to do it god bless you mark dice we'll have you back soon

[3:07:31.680 --> 3:07:35.840]  um my sixth great grandfather constantine quarkson
[3:07:35.840 --> 3:07:40.080]  fought the british at camden and again at greensboro i can't help it
[3:07:40.080 --> 3:07:46.160]  but when is enough enough alex when when is it enough
[3:07:46.160 --> 3:07:52.880]  we try emails calls protesting and it does nothing you know
[3:07:52.880 --> 3:07:56.640]  i try to wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute we've got a president in
[3:07:56.640 --> 3:07:59.440]  most of governors are going patriot we're winning everywhere
[3:07:59.440 --> 3:08:03.360]  things are turning around the globalists are trying to get violent to get us into
[3:08:03.360 --> 3:08:06.480]  violence because they're losing hold on let me ask john rapidport that question
[3:08:06.480 --> 3:08:09.520]  because i'm not saying you're wrong we've been abused we have a right to
[3:08:09.520 --> 3:08:13.200]  physically stand up but you can't just do it to an institution that's full of
[3:08:13.200 --> 3:08:17.360]  good and bad people you have to know how to pick your enemies pick your times
[3:08:17.360 --> 3:08:20.960]  pick your battles i mean are we winning are we losing i mean
[3:08:20.960 --> 3:08:24.160]  that this is an important question when is enough enough i mean i think we've
[3:08:24.160 --> 3:08:28.080]  really already had some big victories of light i think the tides turning
[3:08:28.080 --> 3:08:31.360]  they want to push us into violence because i think that's the only purview
[3:08:31.360 --> 3:08:33.920]  they think they might win quite frankly i think we'll win that too it's just
[3:08:33.920 --> 3:08:38.240]  going to be a pretty serious situation and who knows what war will kick off with
[3:08:38.240 --> 3:08:41.040]  some other country because it's like a disease it's like a
[3:08:41.040 --> 3:08:44.080]  fever wants a big violence breaks out it has to spread
[3:08:44.080 --> 3:08:48.720]  what do you think john rapidport i think that people all over the world alex
[3:08:48.720 --> 3:08:53.040]  are have been waking up at an accelerated rate to the whole
[3:08:53.040 --> 3:08:58.000]  rejection of the globalist framework and of course it takes time i mean it's
[3:08:58.000 --> 3:09:01.520]  not like oh i snapped my fingers and it didn't happen
[3:09:01.520 --> 3:09:04.640]  overnight yeah we were asleep for deck i mean a lot of folks weren't asleep but
[3:09:04.640 --> 3:09:08.960]  the majority were asleep for 50 60 70 years you're not going to just wake up
[3:09:08.960 --> 3:09:11.760]  in in 10 seconds it's going to take some time
[3:09:11.760 --> 3:09:16.160]  yeah so the you've got people in you know england you've got people in other
[3:09:16.160 --> 3:09:19.760]  countries who are saying wait a minute now we don't want to be part of this
[3:09:19.760 --> 3:09:23.360]  globalist framework we're beginning to see what it actually means
[3:09:23.360 --> 3:09:27.840]  it isn't just oh it's wonderful in peace and cooperation internationally
[3:09:27.840 --> 3:09:31.840]  that's not it at all this is a tyranny over the entire planet
[3:09:31.840 --> 3:09:36.400]  to interconnect everything in a robotic way well people are starting to see that
[3:09:36.400 --> 3:09:39.200]  and they don't like it and they don't want it they don't want it in their own
[3:09:39.200 --> 3:09:43.040]  countries so we are definitely winning
[3:09:43.040 --> 3:09:45.920]  now the globalists thought they were invincible in all their algorithms because
[3:09:45.920 --> 3:09:49.280]  of humanity was asleep as humanity awake in the stages of
[3:09:49.280 --> 3:09:51.840]  waking we were in a deep sleep maybe 10 years ago
[3:09:51.840 --> 3:09:54.960]  we're kind of awake getting up getting a cup of coffee right now and in
[3:09:54.960 --> 3:09:58.480]  in my allegory what happens when we actually go to work
[3:09:58.480 --> 3:10:02.240]  you know the next year or two when we walk out the car the bus or walk to work
[3:10:02.240 --> 3:10:06.640]  i mean kind of get awake and get on our hind legs i mean you think that's a
[3:10:06.640 --> 3:10:10.240]  good timeline allegory you bet and i think there's
[3:10:10.240 --> 3:10:13.840]  going to be a lot more defections out of silicon valley
[3:10:13.840 --> 3:10:16.720]  there's going to be oh that's a good thing i meant to say that a week ago
[3:10:16.720 --> 3:10:20.880]  myself we're seeing all these top facebook executives presidents go out and
[3:10:20.880 --> 3:10:25.280]  say we're dehumanizing we hurt you we're sorry this bad what why are they
[3:10:25.280 --> 3:10:28.640]  doing that yeah because well i think you know in
[3:10:28.640 --> 3:10:32.320]  some cases what's happening is they're actually waking up they're
[3:10:32.320 --> 3:10:36.240]  realizing hey this fantasy that we had
[3:10:36.240 --> 3:10:40.400]  you know about how the information age and the internet was automatically going
[3:10:40.400 --> 3:10:43.920]  to take us into utopia that was just a fantasy you
[3:10:43.920 --> 3:10:48.640]  know that was cooked up on purpose in order to pretend
[3:10:48.640 --> 3:10:52.400]  that we were all heading in a great direction rather than into the heart
[3:10:52.400 --> 3:10:55.920]  of evil and some of those people are waking up and
[3:10:55.920 --> 3:10:58.800]  they don't want to be part of that and they're talking out you know they
[3:10:58.800 --> 3:11:03.600]  realize their careers in silicon valley are over so
[3:11:03.600 --> 3:11:06.720]  all right let's tell the truth i think we're going to hear a lot more from
[3:11:06.720 --> 3:11:10.960]  that area gosh that's why i love jonah report because i think
[3:11:10.960 --> 3:11:14.320]  about that with the still the night when i'm calm not on air under lights
[3:11:14.320 --> 3:11:18.720]  i'm like wow defections why are all these top execs saying okay we were wrong
[3:11:18.720 --> 3:11:22.480]  it's bad we're dehumanizing you we prayed on you we knew it but
[3:11:22.480 --> 3:11:25.680]  but we didn't know how bad it would be it's i think they're seeing their own
[3:11:25.680 --> 3:11:28.560]  children i think they go home and their kid doesn't want to talk to them i
[3:11:28.560 --> 3:11:32.800]  think they they i mean they understand this is death
[3:11:32.800 --> 3:11:36.560]  they do and you know there's a tremendous hypocrisy that's uh
[3:11:36.560 --> 3:11:40.560]  becoming schizophrenic up there like these high tech
[3:11:40.560 --> 3:11:44.160]  giants who're sending their kids to private schools
[3:11:44.160 --> 3:11:48.000]  where they there's a rule against having computers and cell phones
[3:11:48.000 --> 3:11:53.520]  oh i'm sorry exactly that's the kind it was it was uh steve jobs before he died
[3:11:53.520 --> 3:11:58.160]  like seven years ago said i don't let my children have iPads
[3:11:58.160 --> 3:12:02.720]  you know they so among those people who are just complete hypocrites there's
[3:12:02.720 --> 3:12:06.080]  others who are you know waking up and saying
[3:12:06.080 --> 3:12:10.720]  gee you know i don't want my kid near any of these i don't want the mojo on me
[3:12:10.720 --> 3:12:16.160]  of billions of souls destroyed exactly i mean there's a thing called
[3:12:16.160 --> 3:12:21.440]  righteous guilt you know which is not debilitating uh
[3:12:21.440 --> 3:12:28.000]  fantasy but it's real you know i was i'm i was part of a machine
[3:12:28.000 --> 3:12:31.920]  that's destroying humanity and i don't want to be any part of it and i've got
[3:12:31.920 --> 3:12:35.280]  to tell the truth we're going to hear a lot more from people like that
[3:12:35.280 --> 3:12:40.560]  powerful john rapaport erin that's your response to what you said you're on
[3:12:40.560 --> 3:12:44.320]  target go ahead and my other thing is i've been
[3:12:44.320 --> 3:12:47.520]  trying to reach out for years on youtube big hickory
[3:12:47.520 --> 3:12:52.160]  357 i'm also on facebook big hickory 357
[3:12:52.160 --> 3:12:56.080]  and when you were talking with mark about people losing their job
[3:12:56.080 --> 3:13:03.200]  i lost my job for my january 1st 2015 video and
[3:13:03.200 --> 3:13:08.560]  so i've been trying to get it out i share your videos actually on my website
[3:13:08.560 --> 3:13:15.040]  big hickory 357.com i even have a link to y'all site
[3:13:15.040 --> 3:13:20.080]  so i understand brother that's why i talk about my own experiences they
[3:13:20.080 --> 3:13:22.720]  they've been keeping everybody in line by intimidation
[3:13:22.720 --> 3:13:27.200]  and the truth is somebody just got to go go ahead and fill your hand
[3:13:27.200 --> 3:13:30.480]  you know wasn't a real movie but it's an archetype john wane with the four guys
[3:13:30.480 --> 3:13:33.440]  with guns and they say it's a lot of talk for a fat man
[3:13:33.440 --> 3:13:36.960]  and one-eyed fat man certain point man it's empowering just say fill your hand
[3:13:36.960 --> 3:13:40.080]  let's go and i think we've reached that point where humanity's tired of being
[3:13:40.080 --> 3:13:44.160]  bully god bless you uh kenyan in ohio real fast thanks for
[3:13:44.160 --> 3:13:48.160]  holding you're awesome thanks for joining us from there with john ravaport
[3:13:48.160 --> 3:13:51.600]  uh yeah i just like to give a shout out to my cousin in california
[3:13:51.600 --> 3:13:56.080]  evan and my grandpa but also let's take time say out of grandpa what's grandpa's
[3:13:56.080 --> 3:14:00.560]  name his name's arnold it's arnold kenyan westman
[3:14:00.560 --> 3:14:04.160]  the first and i'm the third so awesome he's watching right he's watching right
[3:14:04.160 --> 3:14:08.080]  now actually oh anyway with the net neutrality um
[3:14:08.080 --> 3:14:10.960]  i don't know if you realize this but there was a first iteration of that in
[3:14:10.960 --> 3:14:14.240]  2005 i think and i remember reading it and uh
[3:14:14.240 --> 3:14:17.440]  i don't know people read the bills of these things or the license agreements
[3:14:17.440 --> 3:14:21.200]  for these companies we trust just ridiculous and and the reason why i
[3:14:21.200 --> 3:14:25.280]  think that it's becoming so pertinent now is with the cryptocurrencies as the
[3:14:25.280 --> 3:14:29.440]  aggregating gets larger for the cryptocurrencies those companies that
[3:14:29.440 --> 3:14:32.400]  say can rate the cost of the service that they're giving
[3:14:32.400 --> 3:14:35.520]  essentially could be the ones that mediate a market if
[3:14:35.520 --> 3:14:38.880]  well if bitcoins go global like they are now so
[3:14:38.880 --> 3:14:42.320]  with information being as it is being sold and bought it's like it's a battle
[3:14:42.320 --> 3:14:44.800]  between the two like i'm going to provide the content but i don't have to pay
[3:14:44.800 --> 3:14:48.160]  for you to use my super servers but i have all the computation on this end and
[3:14:48.160 --> 3:14:50.800]  you have all the bandwidth on that's what i'm saying it's really a battle over
[3:14:50.800 --> 3:14:54.960]  the future not oh barbara gave us neutrality he's taking it that's just
[3:14:54.960 --> 3:14:58.960]  dumbing it down that's how it was hogwash from the from the first
[3:14:58.960 --> 3:15:04.400]  first portions of that bill but i think that if you've read about the global
[3:15:04.400 --> 3:15:08.080]  amount of energy that cryptocurrencies consume it's going to become a real
[3:15:08.080 --> 3:15:10.560]  problem as far as bandwidth goes and those companies i think are going to be
[3:15:10.560 --> 3:15:13.760]  trying to take advantage of that wow smart guy we'll call us back about that
[3:15:13.760 --> 3:15:16.000]  i'm punching out not because i don't want to be here i don't want to run over

[3:21:07.040 --> 3:21:13.280]  massive christmas savings at info wars store.com
[3:21:13.280 --> 3:21:20.320]  so i return to my shall i say favorite subject i don't know how if that's
[3:21:20.320 --> 3:21:23.760]  really the word for it but it's the medical cartel
[3:21:23.760 --> 3:21:29.840]  why do i keep harping upon the medical cartel why do i keep delivering you
[3:21:29.840 --> 3:21:35.520]  fact after fact after fact because the medical cartel is
[3:21:35.520 --> 3:21:39.760]  one of the great action arms of globalism
[3:21:39.760 --> 3:21:46.960]  meaning you can't subdue an entire planet and put it under one system
[3:21:46.960 --> 3:21:55.520]  unless you subdue and pacify and toxify and debilitate and weaken
[3:21:55.520 --> 3:22:01.280]  the billions of people on the planet that's the deal folks
[3:22:01.280 --> 3:22:05.120]  it's very hard for some people to accept or to see because
[3:22:05.120 --> 3:22:09.360]  their view of the medical cartel is that it's all wonderful and all saves lives
[3:22:09.360 --> 3:22:13.680]  and so forth and yeah there are really good doctors especially emergency
[3:22:13.680 --> 3:22:17.600]  crisis doctors that can put people back together again
[3:22:17.600 --> 3:22:23.200]  in an acute crisis situation but that is the cover
[3:22:23.200 --> 3:22:27.760]  that's what's being parlayed into the false assertion
[3:22:27.760 --> 3:22:32.480]  that the entire medical cartel is doing the same kind of good work and nothing
[3:22:32.480 --> 3:22:40.560]  could be further from the truth no it's an arm of globalism
[3:22:40.560 --> 3:22:47.520]  106 000 people conservative estimate killed by fda approved
[3:22:47.520 --> 3:22:53.360]  pharmaceuticals in the u.s every year that's a million per decade
[3:22:53.360 --> 3:23:00.160]  a million per decade we had a smallpox revelation recently
[3:23:00.160 --> 3:23:04.880]  the fda made an announcement about a case that it's pursuing
[3:23:04.880 --> 3:23:08.640]  and in the middle of the announcement it said
[3:23:08.640 --> 3:23:13.040]  the smallpox vaccine should not be given to people whose immune systems are
[3:23:13.040 --> 3:23:15.200]  weak
[3:23:15.680 --> 3:23:20.720]  that's like one of those gems that stands out in the middle of the night sky
[3:23:20.720 --> 3:23:24.880]  and reveals the truth why and i hope there's a whole lot
[3:23:24.880 --> 3:23:28.160]  of people listening in africa right now
[3:23:28.160 --> 3:23:34.240]  hope there's a whole lot of people because between the years 1966 and 1980
[3:23:34.240 --> 3:23:41.600]  in africa 100 million shots of smallpox vaccine were
[3:23:41.600 --> 3:23:46.880]  delivered on that continent and millions and millions of
[3:23:46.880 --> 3:23:53.600]  those people who got that shot happen to have weakened immune system
[3:23:53.600 --> 3:23:57.120]  what does that mean that means that the vaccine
[3:23:57.120 --> 3:24:02.320]  causes smallpox in those people or destroys their lives through other
[3:24:02.320 --> 3:24:07.360]  kinds of damage or kills them outright
[3:24:07.360 --> 3:24:12.480]  and yet in 1980 the united nations in the world health organization
[3:24:12.480 --> 3:24:15.520]  popped the corks on the champagne and celebrated
[3:24:15.520 --> 3:24:19.200]  the elimination of smallpox in the third world and said
[3:24:19.200 --> 3:24:24.000]  that this was the greatest medical triumph in history
[3:24:24.000 --> 3:24:27.280]  you get what i'm talking about here
[3:24:27.840 --> 3:24:32.080]  these are the kinds of deceptions that i'm talking about
[3:24:32.080 --> 3:24:37.360]  all the medical experts agree do not give this vaccine to anybody whose immune
[3:24:37.360 --> 3:24:44.320]  system is weak over here 14 years of giving millions and
[3:24:44.320 --> 3:24:49.280]  millions and millions of shots in africa to people whose immune
[3:24:49.280 --> 3:24:52.320]  systems are weak
[3:24:52.880 --> 3:24:59.360]  now i happen to know because i had a very credible source
[3:24:59.360 --> 3:25:04.000]  molecular biologists tell me that after the so-called celebration
[3:25:04.000 --> 3:25:10.320]  of eliminating smallpox in africa in 1980 there was a super secret
[3:25:10.320 --> 3:25:15.520]  meeting in geneva of the world health organization
[3:25:15.520 --> 3:25:19.360]  at which it was decided they would never
[3:25:19.360 --> 3:25:25.840]  use this vaccine again and i said to my source why and he said because it
[3:25:25.840 --> 3:25:35.440]  caused smallpox get it it caused smallpox
[3:25:35.440 --> 3:25:39.040]  now you're not getting that on the evening news you're not getting that in
[3:25:39.040 --> 3:25:43.120]  the mainstream news you're getting that right here
[3:25:43.120 --> 3:25:48.800]  you're getting the deeper truth right here
[3:25:48.800 --> 3:25:54.400]  now you could say oh well they made a mistake in africa you know it's just
[3:25:54.400 --> 3:25:59.520]  one of those things that happens uh bureaucratic confusion and whatever
[3:25:59.520 --> 3:26:03.200]  you know i have to say i'm sick and tired of people
[3:26:03.200 --> 3:26:07.200]  who keep making excuses for these murders
[3:26:07.200 --> 3:26:11.440]  it's way beyond the time of making excuses
[3:26:11.440 --> 3:26:18.320]  they knew understand they knew very well that giving this vaccine to people
[3:26:18.320 --> 3:26:22.000]  whose immune systems were already weak would push them over the
[3:26:22.000 --> 3:26:28.160]  edge and destroy their lives they knew that at the outset in 1966
[3:26:28.160 --> 3:26:35.200]  they knew it in 1980 they know it now there's no it's not like you and i
[3:26:35.200 --> 3:26:41.760]  have this uh incredibly arcane knowledge that is not shared by it
[3:26:41.760 --> 3:26:48.160]  no this is an open source piece of information that was known
[3:26:48.160 --> 3:26:53.040]  and is known to doctors all over the world
[3:26:53.360 --> 3:26:58.160]  and yet they went ahead with that vaccination campaign
[3:26:58.160 --> 3:27:02.080]  what does that tell you that's all the clue
[3:27:02.080 --> 3:27:08.640]  you can't have it both ways my friends you can't say
[3:27:08.640 --> 3:27:12.800]  they knew but uh you know it was a mistake no
[3:27:12.800 --> 3:27:18.720]  if they knew they did it on purpose if they if you know the effect of
[3:27:18.720 --> 3:27:23.520]  something you're going to do is horrendous
[3:27:23.520 --> 3:27:29.440]  on the people you're going to do it to and you do it anyway then you know
[3:27:29.440 --> 3:27:35.360]  you know in advance and what does that mean that means you want to
[3:27:35.360 --> 3:27:39.360]  create that horrendous outcome the people
[3:27:39.360 --> 3:27:44.800]  that you're doing is to there is no other way around it
[3:27:45.920 --> 3:27:52.000]  and we have to face up to that because you can't just expose all of this
[3:27:52.000 --> 3:27:55.680]  information that i've been doing say for the last 35 years
[3:27:55.680 --> 3:27:59.200]  and then say well i'm going to leave intent
[3:27:59.200 --> 3:28:02.800]  out of the equation i'm not going to be talking about that i think we don't want
[3:28:02.800 --> 3:28:07.840]  to get into those deep waters no you have

[3:34:06.720 --> 3:34:11.280]  cartel here let me give you a couple current
[3:34:11.280 --> 3:34:16.800]  stories that not getting the coverage that they
[3:34:16.800 --> 3:34:23.200]  should get synophy a gigantic pharmaceutical company
[3:34:23.200 --> 3:34:26.320]  is having some problems in the philippines
[3:34:26.320 --> 3:34:31.120]  now i wish that people in the federal government here
[3:34:31.120 --> 3:34:34.960]  would pay attention because something's happening down there
[3:34:34.960 --> 3:34:38.720]  actually the government officials are in an
[3:34:38.720 --> 3:34:45.200]  uproar because of a vaccine campaign using synophy's
[3:34:45.200 --> 3:34:51.840]  vaccine against dengue fever okay thousands of kids have already been
[3:34:51.840 --> 3:34:55.680]  vaccinated in the philippines and all of a sudden
[3:34:55.680 --> 3:34:59.440]  through an uproar in the federal government the program
[3:34:59.440 --> 3:35:05.520]  is stopped the vaccine campaign is stopped in its tracks
[3:35:05.520 --> 3:35:10.160]  why because somebody in the government
[3:35:10.160 --> 3:35:16.880]  health ministry figured out that synophy itself the manufacturer
[3:35:16.880 --> 3:35:23.280]  said although they wouldn't want to repeat it now
[3:35:23.280 --> 3:35:30.240]  this vaccine can be dangerous might be dangerous
[3:35:30.240 --> 3:35:37.360]  to children who quote haven't contacted the dengue virus
[3:35:37.360 --> 3:35:44.560]  before here's an admission from the manufacturer
[3:35:44.560 --> 3:35:49.440]  and then in the federal government of the philippines their own experts i mean
[3:35:49.440 --> 3:35:55.760]  mainstream experts were warning them before they started this massive
[3:35:55.760 --> 3:36:00.880]  dengue fever vaccine campaign to watch out not to do it because
[3:36:00.880 --> 3:36:05.840]  the safety and efficacy of the vaccine had not yet been proven but they went
[3:36:05.840 --> 3:36:10.480]  ahead anyway and now they're paying the price
[3:36:10.480 --> 3:36:17.120]  and the campaign has been stopped stopped in its tracks
[3:36:17.760 --> 3:36:23.440]  that's an example that the u.s and other countries ought to follow
[3:36:23.440 --> 3:36:28.080]  why can't they follow that why can't one of these senators
[3:36:28.080 --> 3:36:34.240]  or a whole bunch of these people get up on their hind legs and say
[3:36:34.240 --> 3:36:41.360]  stop no more we want an investigation of the vaccine
[3:36:41.360 --> 3:36:46.080]  safety situation
[3:36:47.200 --> 3:36:53.600]  you understand what i'm saying here trump hand it at it when he was elected
[3:36:53.600 --> 3:37:00.960]  during the campaign he said yes it makes sense to see and assume
[3:37:00.960 --> 3:37:08.320]  there's a connection between giving vaccines and kids getting autism
[3:37:08.320 --> 3:37:11.360]  he was not the only one that said it during the campaign if you remember
[3:37:11.360 --> 3:37:17.920]  that republican debate okay so
[3:37:17.920 --> 3:37:25.840]  those people and us can just sit here and say well i wonder when he's going to
[3:37:25.840 --> 3:37:30.960]  launch the investigation well maybe it's going to be never
[3:37:32.000 --> 3:37:37.040]  maybe it's up to us to present the truth loudly enough because
[3:37:37.040 --> 3:37:40.400]  we're not just talking about a scientific issue here
[3:37:40.400 --> 3:37:43.920]  we're talking about the destruction of human life in this country and all over
[3:37:43.920 --> 3:37:48.560]  the planet through the delivery of toxic elements in these vaccines like
[3:37:48.560 --> 3:37:57.280]  mercury aluminum formaldehyde injected into children injected into babies
[3:37:57.280 --> 3:38:04.400]  never had a study a really well done study comparing the vaccinated and the
[3:38:04.400 --> 3:38:10.640]  unvaccinated in a mainstream setting
[3:38:11.360 --> 3:38:16.880]  to validate all of the bs claims of the centers for disease control and
[3:38:16.880 --> 3:38:19.280]  everybody else said oh these things are marvelously
[3:38:19.280 --> 3:38:23.920]  safe and effective yeah really is that right
[3:38:23.920 --> 3:38:29.120]  so why did they suddenly stop this massive vaccine campaign in the philippines
[3:38:29.120 --> 3:38:32.560]  and now everybody's looking at everybody with egg on their face and saying well
[3:38:32.560 --> 3:38:37.200]  what do we do now yellow what you do now is you look at what's in the vaccine
[3:38:37.200 --> 3:38:41.840]  okay guys down there in the philippines we have any listeners down there
[3:38:41.840 --> 3:38:46.320]  i'm sure we do look at what's in the vaccine
[3:38:46.320 --> 3:38:49.840]  look at the toxic elements and the chemicals
[3:38:49.840 --> 3:38:55.600]  send it out to independent labs to analyze the extraneous contamination and
[3:38:55.600 --> 3:38:59.920]  germs that are not supposed to be in the vaccine that are there
[3:38:59.920 --> 3:39:05.920]  let's go if you're going to go go all the way
[3:39:05.920 --> 3:39:11.600]  the medical cartel is in the business of destroying human life
[3:39:11.600 --> 3:39:17.680]  and debilitating the brain and the mind for a very good reason
[3:39:17.680 --> 3:39:21.280]  as i keep saying because i want to put this in front of you
[3:39:21.280 --> 3:39:24.960]  so there's no mistake about what i'm talking about here
[3:39:24.960 --> 3:39:32.320]  if you want to run a planet by a top-down tyranny aka globalism
[3:39:32.320 --> 3:39:37.600]  you have got to confuse destroy weak and debilitate
[3:39:37.600 --> 3:39:42.480]  pacify billions of people in order to make that happen
[3:39:42.480 --> 3:39:47.360]  and how can you do that by waging a covert chemical war against the entire
[3:39:47.360 --> 3:39:53.280]  population aka toxic vaccines and toxic medical
[3:39:53.280 --> 3:39:58.400]  drugs that is in fact what's happening and has
[3:39:58.400 --> 3:40:05.440]  been happening for a very long time absolutely true
[3:40:05.440 --> 3:40:09.920]  here's another piece to the puzzle
[3:40:09.920 --> 3:40:15.760]  all of a sudden out of australia and other places comes the news
[3:40:15.760 --> 3:40:22.640]  you know the flu vaccine this year is really only about 10 percent
[3:40:22.640 --> 3:40:29.760]  effective this is mainstream news now admitting this out in the open
[3:40:29.760 --> 3:40:34.880]  this is if you accept the whole theory of what vaccines do and so forth and so
[3:40:34.880 --> 3:40:38.640]  on which i don't but even then they're admitting
[3:40:38.640 --> 3:40:42.480]  only 10 percent effective why well there's a new study and everybody's
[3:40:42.480 --> 3:40:46.080]  climbing on board well it turns out you see they make the
[3:40:46.080 --> 3:40:50.960]  flu vaccine with chicken eggs and when you put the flu virus
[3:40:50.960 --> 3:40:55.040]  into the vaccine into the chicken eggs
[3:40:55.040 --> 3:41:01.040]  it mutates and so what the vaccine is actually delivering is not
[3:41:01.040 --> 3:41:06.480]  the flu virus of the season that we are seeing
[3:41:06.480 --> 3:41:10.240]  but some mutated form with who knows what effect
[3:41:10.240 --> 3:41:15.920]  but it certainly isn't the effect of immunizing anybody

[3:46:59.520 --> 3:47:06.080]  john map report here in the last segment fourth hour and four sitting in for alex
[3:47:06.080 --> 3:47:10.480]  talking about globalist destruction of human life and how
[3:47:10.480 --> 3:47:15.760]  you're getting the actual news here you're not getting it in mainstream news
[3:47:15.760 --> 3:47:19.440]  mainstream news is paralyzed they can't tell you
[3:47:19.440 --> 3:47:23.600]  about this because they are in partnership with
[3:47:23.600 --> 3:47:28.560]  medical cartel not only are they being sponsored
[3:47:28.560 --> 3:47:36.960]  uh three point two billion dollars spent so far in 2017 by pharmaceutical
[3:47:36.960 --> 3:47:42.720]  companies three point two billion dollars on tv ads
[3:47:42.720 --> 3:47:46.640]  just tv ads right
[3:47:47.520 --> 3:47:51.280]  gee i wonder if there's any pharmaceutical control over the news
[3:47:51.280 --> 3:47:54.720]  so just imagine that if on the nbc nightly news
[3:47:54.720 --> 3:47:57.840]  what i've been talking about here for the last 40 minutes or so
[3:47:57.840 --> 3:48:04.560]  we're highlighted as the main lead story with a promise that we've got our
[3:48:04.560 --> 3:48:08.720]  hounds our reporters out there folks and we're digging into this what's
[3:48:08.720 --> 3:48:12.000]  happening with the troubling stories about vaccines
[3:48:12.000 --> 3:48:15.680]  destroying life and medical drugs destroying life and we're not going to
[3:48:15.680 --> 3:48:20.000]  stop until we get to the bottom of this and what's really going on because we
[3:48:20.000 --> 3:48:24.560]  know that they know what they're doing
[3:48:24.560 --> 3:48:28.960]  when they destroy human life and you can be sure that we
[3:48:28.960 --> 3:48:35.760]  will stay on the story well the next day everybody in that newsroom
[3:48:35.760 --> 3:48:39.360]  would be fired blackballed for the rest of their lives
[3:48:39.360 --> 3:48:43.200]  pharmaceutical companies would suddenly withdraw
[3:48:43.200 --> 3:48:47.200]  maybe 50 million dollars worth of advertising overnight
[3:48:47.200 --> 3:48:51.200]  from that giant network just to show them
[3:48:51.200 --> 3:48:55.360]  the power of what they can do and everybody would capitulate we'll never
[3:48:55.360 --> 3:49:00.400]  do anything like that again that was just somebody went psychotic i'm sorry
[3:49:00.400 --> 3:49:03.280]  you know
[3:49:03.360 --> 3:49:09.520]  but we don't have that problem here we don't have that problem we expose
[3:49:09.520 --> 3:49:15.920]  the psychotics we expose the psychotics for example
[3:49:15.920 --> 3:49:20.400]  all this business about students being triggered
[3:49:20.400 --> 3:49:27.520]  at universities this epidemic of uh so-called uh whatever
[3:49:27.520 --> 3:49:32.160]  safe space i've got to have my safe space because any word you say
[3:49:32.160 --> 3:49:39.120]  any gesture you make any move could trigger me and put me into a state of
[3:49:39.120 --> 3:49:43.200]  horror therefore i must have my hot chocolate
[3:49:43.200 --> 3:49:47.120]  and i must sit in a little kitty room and play with toys and
[3:49:47.120 --> 3:49:52.240]  i can't listen to certain ideas and my teachers have to warn me
[3:49:52.240 --> 3:49:55.760]  issue a trigger warning and blah blah blah whenever they're going to say
[3:49:55.760 --> 3:49:59.360]  anything pretty much right
[3:49:59.680 --> 3:50:03.120]  where do you think all that came from
[3:50:03.600 --> 3:50:08.000]  some months ago i exposed the fact
[3:50:08.000 --> 3:50:15.360]  that on u.s college campuses 25 percent okay listen to this 25 percent of
[3:50:15.360 --> 3:50:21.360]  students in the last year received a diagnosis
[3:50:21.360 --> 3:50:25.360]  of a mental disorder or were being treated with drugs
[3:50:25.360 --> 3:50:30.160]  for a mental disorder 25 percent so if you send your kids to college in this
[3:50:30.160 --> 3:50:32.320]  country you're pretty much sending them to a
[3:50:32.320 --> 3:50:36.640]  psychiatric clinic where they will be diagnosed with a mental
[3:50:36.640 --> 3:50:42.160]  disorder and then prescribed toxic brain
[3:50:42.160 --> 3:50:45.520]  scrambling drugs i've documented this for years the
[3:50:45.520 --> 3:50:49.920]  antidepressants the antipsychotic drugs which are more and more
[3:50:49.920 --> 3:50:55.200]  being used for ordinary people with ordinary problems
[3:50:55.200 --> 3:51:00.800]  the speed type drugs for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder
[3:51:00.800 --> 3:51:04.960]  where speed crash happens and then depression
[3:51:04.960 --> 3:51:09.600]  and then antidepressants are prescribed and then up and down and then
[3:51:09.600 --> 3:51:13.600]  bipolar is diagnosed and then heavier drugs are given
[3:51:13.600 --> 3:51:17.840]  yeah these kids are being driven insane by
[3:51:17.840 --> 3:51:24.080]  psychiatrists and then you hear all this i could be
[3:51:24.080 --> 3:51:29.200]  triggered by anything yeah sure some of it is completely made up and
[3:51:29.200 --> 3:51:34.320]  ridiculous yes yes but there's some of it that is coming
[3:51:34.320 --> 3:51:41.120]  from being poisoned and brain assaulted by psychiatric drugs
[3:51:41.120 --> 3:51:46.640]  on college campuses because it's now the american university and college system
[3:51:46.640 --> 3:51:53.120]  is now a giant psychiatric industry outpost
[3:51:53.120 --> 3:51:57.360]  understand that things are not like they
[3:51:57.360 --> 3:52:02.480]  used to be folks i know it takes a stretch
[3:52:02.480 --> 3:52:06.400]  takes a stretch for me too at first i i i know this couldn't be
[3:52:06.400 --> 3:52:10.880]  you mean this is happening now how could that be it wasn't happening when i was
[3:52:10.880 --> 3:52:16.400]  going up no it wasn't but the globalists are changing things
[3:52:16.400 --> 3:52:19.600]  and this thing that i'm talking about in college campuses this being done on
[3:52:19.600 --> 3:52:24.080]  purpose the psychiatrists know the effects of
[3:52:24.080 --> 3:52:28.640]  these drugs they are not in the dark about it
[3:52:28.640 --> 3:52:33.520]  the pharmaceutical companies that make the horrendous psychiatric drugs
[3:52:33.520 --> 3:52:38.080]  know about the effects of these drugs on the brain
[3:52:38.080 --> 3:52:42.000]  they are not in the dark either and they keep
[3:52:42.000 --> 3:52:47.760]  doing it don't let them off the hook don't say
[3:52:47.760 --> 3:52:51.280]  we are the privileged few who know the truth
[3:52:51.280 --> 3:52:57.040]  and these poor psychiatrists they just haven't been let in on the story yet
[3:52:57.040 --> 3:53:03.680]  come on come on wise up they know and they're doing it anyway
[3:53:03.680 --> 3:53:07.520]  they're poisoning your children straight out
[3:53:07.520 --> 3:53:15.360]  straight into the brain brain poison that's the way it's being done
[3:53:15.360 --> 3:53:19.120]  on college campuses and in society in general
[3:53:19.120 --> 3:53:26.960]  but particularly 25 1 out of 4 i mean can you imagine
[3:53:26.960 --> 3:53:31.760]  kids are bouncing off the walls with these places
[3:53:31.760 --> 3:53:36.320]  and how does this all start this has been documented
[3:53:36.320 --> 3:53:41.120]  the stories have been told i've been looking into this for a very long time
[3:53:41.120 --> 3:53:44.480]  as a reporter a kid starts out with a problem at
[3:53:44.480 --> 3:53:48.320]  college can't study don't under what's going on with all
[3:53:48.320 --> 3:53:51.360]  these courses i've never had so much homework in my life
[3:53:51.360 --> 3:53:54.720]  i don't know what to do what major shall i choose
[3:53:54.720 --> 3:54:01.840]  how do i approach the opposite sex and date and this and that and what about
[3:54:01.840 --> 3:54:06.160]  social relationships and the dorm and you know okay
[3:54:06.160 --> 3:54:09.680]  kid gets a little bit overwhelmed doesn't know what to do
[3:54:09.680 --> 3:54:14.240]  goes to see somebody in the counseling office
[3:54:14.240 --> 3:54:17.520]  at one time there would be a conversation
[3:54:17.520 --> 3:54:21.920]  there would be a little bit of help perhaps you know some tutoring whatever
[3:54:21.920 --> 3:54:27.120]  orientation that this is you know how what college is all about and whatever
[3:54:27.120 --> 3:54:32.000]  whatever advice no now it's like boom referrals to
[3:54:32.000 --> 3:54:39.760]  psychiatrists prescription written diagnosis of a mental disorder made
[3:54:39.760 --> 3:54:44.400]  drugs drugs drugs drugs chemical warfare
[3:54:44.400 --> 3:54:50.160]  that's what it is folks the drugs are chemical warfare
[3:54:50.160 --> 3:54:56.400]  straight out part of the plan absolutely part of the plan
[3:54:56.400 --> 3:55:00.640]  want to destroy a country destroy the young
[3:55:00.640 --> 3:55:06.160]  these people will never be the same think about that these students they get
[3:55:06.160 --> 3:55:09.120]  out of college they've been diagnosed with one or two
[3:55:09.120 --> 3:55:12.560]  mental disorders they have been on drugs
[3:55:12.560 --> 3:55:18.240]  constantly debilitating brain scrambling drugs you think when they
[3:55:18.240 --> 3:55:20.880]  graduate all of a sudden they're just going to say
[3:55:20.880 --> 3:55:26.080]  hooray i'm now free of all that no they're going to go through their whole
[3:55:26.080 --> 3:55:33.280]  lives both psychologically and chemically dependent
[3:55:33.840 --> 3:55:38.080]  want to destroy a country destroy the young
[3:55:38.080 --> 3:55:44.720]  so it may interest you to know and again i've documented this six ways from
[3:55:44.720 --> 3:55:49.440]  sunday over the years that in the bible of the psychiatric
[3:55:49.440 --> 3:55:55.680]  profession called the dsm the diagnostic and statistical manual manual
[3:55:55.680 --> 3:56:00.880]  of mental disorders published by the american psychiatric association
[3:56:00.880 --> 3:56:05.040]  with new updated editions every few years right
[3:56:05.040 --> 3:56:09.440]  they list all of the supposed official psychiatric
[3:56:09.440 --> 3:56:14.560]  mental disorders at last count there were roughly
[3:56:14.560 --> 3:56:22.560]  300 of them really 300 different mental disorders
[3:56:22.560 --> 3:56:32.800]  you're kidding in not one of these cases is there a defining diagnostic
[3:56:32.800 --> 3:56:39.760]  test for no none of the listed so-called mental disorders
[3:56:39.760 --> 3:56:45.760]  is there a defining diagnostic test like a brain scan a genetic assay a blood
[3:56:45.760 --> 3:56:51.760]  test a urine test a hair test nothing zero if you
[3:56:51.760 --> 3:56:58.480]  don't believe me be my guest read it and weep
