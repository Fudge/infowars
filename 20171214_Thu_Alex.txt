[00:00:11.625 --> 00:00:12.746]  Big Brother.
[00:00:12.746 --> 00:00:14.547]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:14.547 --> 00:00:16.488]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:16.488 --> 00:00:18.148]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:00:18.148 --> 00:00:19.809]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:19.809 --> 00:00:24.512]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:33.946]  Coming to you live from the ATX, it is Thursday, the 14th day of December, 2017.
[00:00:33.946 --> 00:00:37.969]  We're going to be live here for the next four hours.
[00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:39.671]  John Rappaport's going to join us.
[00:00:39.671 --> 00:00:42.713]  Mark Dice coming up the third hour.
[00:00:42.713 --> 00:00:46.036]  Open phones starting in the first hour.
[00:00:46.036 --> 00:00:53.042]  But I got to tell you, we played some of the big highlights of the congressional hearings yesterday.
[00:00:54.713 --> 00:01:08.736]  about the criminal activity of the Clinton stay-behind network inside the Justice Department trying to frame the president to steal and overturn the 2016 election.
[00:01:08.736 --> 00:01:13.698]  But this thing went on all day and so we weren't able to watch all of it.
[00:01:13.698 --> 00:01:15.178]  We played some bombshell clips.
[00:01:17.182 --> 00:01:25.810]  Then last night and this morning, I found more clips and the crew brought more clips to my attention that are unbelievable.
[00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:40.723]  Because if Congressman Jordan, Jim Jordan, and if Congressman Trey Gowdy said the things they said last week they knew were coming out, they came out this week, they then foreshadowed what's going to happen next week, and that is the resignation
[00:01:42.651 --> 00:01:48.776]  of Andrew McCabe, the head of the FBI, because he's in the emails that they held off till the night before the hearing.
[00:01:48.776 --> 00:01:50.057]  They held them off till Tuesday night.
[00:01:50.057 --> 00:02:03.767]  Then, of course, they had the hearings actually on Wednesday, where he's in the meeting quarterbacking how to bring down Trump during the election and saying, don't panic, we're going to defeat him.
[00:02:03.767 --> 00:02:05.469]  And then they run the whole fake fusion.
[00:02:06.755 --> 00:02:13.518]  GPS deal and they've got the Justice Department paying millions to the wife of the head of the Justice Department, Russia Unit!
[00:02:13.518 --> 00:02:18.521]  I mean, total collusion!
[00:02:18.521 --> 00:02:31.027]  It'd be like the judge, the jury, and the prosecutor in your trial all being a father, a wife, the judge is the father, the prosecutor is the wife, and then they've got 11 children and they're the jury.
[00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:33.482]  You'd say, recuse yourself.
[00:02:33.482 --> 00:02:34.423]  Conflict of interest.
[00:02:34.423 --> 00:02:42.610]  It doesn't... This is as bad as Hitler sitting in judgment of the Nazis in Nuremberg.
[00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:44.232]  I mean, this is... Whoa.
[00:02:44.232 --> 00:02:52.240]  This is so over-the-top, arrogant, belligerent, hubris-filled, chutzpah-filled, bravado-filled.
[00:02:53.868 --> 00:03:12.059]  The arrogance, the recklessness, the fake confidence that criminals and scum and betas engage in, when betas finally get in a man's world and get together as a group of betas and start engaging in criminal activity, they just do things alphas would never do.
[00:03:12.059 --> 00:03:17.623]  I keep learning that it's betas who are the ones that get together and commit the really big crimes.
[00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:22.612]  They're all a bunch of chicken-neck, anti-American trash.
[00:03:22.612 --> 00:03:24.314]  I mean, you read their emails, their texts.
[00:03:24.314 --> 00:03:35.043]  I mean, these are people that have a big, giant, you-know-what for America, and just hate flyover country, and hate bitter clingers, and hate Christians, and just hate everything.
[00:03:35.043 --> 00:03:37.706]  I mean, this is a group of garbage.
[00:03:38.286 --> 00:03:39.867]  But you've got to be garbage.
[00:03:39.867 --> 00:03:45.211]  If people are in your business, which is our country, robbing it, they're going to hate the people they're robbing.
[00:03:45.211 --> 00:03:46.332]  It's what criminals do.
[00:03:46.332 --> 00:03:49.093]  They always demonize who they're robbing.
[00:03:49.093 --> 00:03:52.556]  And they always think they're invincible until they get caught robbing.
[00:03:56.072 --> 00:04:04.418]  And then they think threats and intimidation and garbage work on people who are alphas because they're betas and it would work on them.
[00:04:04.418 --> 00:04:06.339]  Well, it doesn't work on Trump.
[00:04:06.339 --> 00:04:08.020]  It doesn't work on America.
[00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:09.582]  And it doesn't work on me.
[00:04:09.582 --> 00:04:11.163]  Make up whatever you want.
[00:04:11.163 --> 00:04:12.484]  Do whatever you want.
[00:04:12.484 --> 00:04:14.565]  Hit me with your best shot, baby.
[00:04:14.565 --> 00:04:15.246]  Fire away.
[00:04:15.246 --> 00:04:20.769]  Because you are all going to prison!
[00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:25.473]  And the rest of it, the NFL, Hollywood, MSNBC, CNN, you're already in tatters.
[00:04:26.493 --> 00:04:27.635]  But you're going down.
[00:04:27.635 --> 00:04:30.739]  So coming up, we've got the clips.
[00:04:30.739 --> 00:04:35.546]  On the other side of this break, the bombshell of bombshells!
[00:04:37.148 --> 00:04:42.950]  Just like Congressman Jordan and others foreshadowed what would happen this week, they foreshadowed what's happening next week.
[00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:45.971]  And that is the FBI director gone.
[00:04:45.971 --> 00:04:48.012]  He better resign right now.
[00:04:48.012 --> 00:04:56.495]  It's even better if he tries to stay in there when he was quarterbacking the whole thing and hanging off Hillary Clinton's hind tit.
[00:04:56.495 --> 00:04:57.276]  He'll be right back.
[00:04:57.276 --> 00:05:02.238]  Stay with us.
[00:05:02.238 --> 00:05:05.139]  You heard it here first, and the globalists are already dreading it.
[00:05:06.075 --> 00:05:11.759]  It's the first annual Christmas Spectacular Extravaganza brought to you by InfoWars.
[00:05:11.759 --> 00:05:15.041]  And it's launching Christmas week, leading into Christmas.
[00:05:15.041 --> 00:05:17.583]  You know, Christmas is about Christmas.

[00:05:53.854 --> 00:05:59.179]  Again, it is the Christmas spectacular extravaganza!
[00:06:23.157 --> 00:06:26.980]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:36.288]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:06:36.288 --> 00:06:37.229]  Ladies and gentlemen!
[00:06:38.649 --> 00:06:57.958]  Former prosecutor, congressional insider Trey Gowdy said he'll be surprised if FBI Director McCabe hasn't resigned by next week over the new emails that they've been forced to turn over, that they tried to keep from Congress, totally violating the Hatch Act, violating federal law flagrantly.
[00:06:59.175 --> 00:07:00.596]  But it gets worse.
[00:07:00.596 --> 00:07:14.962]  You've got the FBI giving millions of dollars with McCabe directing it behind the scenes during the campaign against Trump in emails and text messages saying, don't worry, we're going to stop Trump and we're going to fund Fusion GPS.
[00:07:14.962 --> 00:07:25.207]  Then the Justice Department head that's over that program gives millions of dollars to his wife, the head of those operations at Fusion GPS.
[00:07:25.207 --> 00:07:27.628]  The judges involved that had to recuse themselves.
[00:07:28.690 --> 00:07:30.911]  I mean, this is unbelievable.
[00:07:30.911 --> 00:07:49.941]  This was a Clinton cadre, or a strike force, inside the Justice Department, the same ones that were the cleanup crew for them on Uranium One, the servers, the foundation, the thousands of kids coming up missing, hundreds in Haiti.
[00:07:49.941 --> 00:07:51.682]  I mean, this is incredible.
[00:07:51.682 --> 00:07:55.804]  And it's all breaking, and it's all confirmed, and it's all criminal.
[00:07:57.711 --> 00:08:03.453]  So ladies and gentlemen, this is huge and very, very positive.
[00:08:03.453 --> 00:08:09.895]  We're going to play that clip of Trey Gowdy yesterday in the bombshell hearings.
[00:08:09.895 --> 00:08:18.038]  And again, Trey Gowdy and Congressman Jordan all foreshadowed last week what would come out this week because they've already got the documents.
[00:08:18.038 --> 00:08:19.798]  OK, they've got high level security clearances.
[00:08:19.798 --> 00:08:27.201]  They're just making the Justice Department and the FBI turn it over or wait and see if they lie about it.
[00:08:27.964 --> 00:08:28.745]  They got it all.
[00:08:28.745 --> 00:08:29.586]  They got the whole thing.
[00:08:29.586 --> 00:08:31.308]  Hell, we had the whole thing six months ago.
[00:08:31.308 --> 00:08:40.621]  I mean, a year ago we knew about the operation, so Trump's just been giving them rope, giving them rope, giving them rope, giving them rope.
[00:08:40.621 --> 00:08:42.183]  Here's the big problem, though.
[00:08:42.183 --> 00:08:43.204]  This is on NewsWars.com.
[00:08:44.835 --> 00:08:45.515]  Assange.
[00:08:45.515 --> 00:08:48.958]  Trump being sucked dry before installation of President Pence.
[00:08:48.958 --> 00:08:52.240]  Same thing Drudge has been saying with all their amazing contacts.
[00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:54.921]  And it's not that Pence himself is bad.
[00:08:54.921 --> 00:09:01.325]  They're keeping him separated, as you always do, so that if anything happens to the President, you've got politically the Vice President.
[00:09:01.325 --> 00:09:04.507]  But they're using that installation to basically prepare him for that.
[00:09:04.507 --> 00:09:05.868]  So that's a serious situation.
[00:09:05.868 --> 00:09:06.488]  That's coming up.
[00:09:06.488 --> 00:09:09.610]  We've got even bigger news on the North Korea situation.
[00:09:09.610 --> 00:09:11.391]  And the Russian President saying the U.S.
[00:09:11.391 --> 00:09:13.012]  is in danger of a major war.
[00:09:13.012 --> 00:09:14.453]  We've got some statements from Putin coming up.
[00:09:14.673 --> 00:09:23.538]  First, ladies and gentlemen, here it is, here is Trey Gowdy with this amazing statement.
[00:09:23.538 --> 00:09:33.704]  I hate it for Rod Rosenstein that he's the one explaining it because he's not Peter Strzok and he's not Andy McCabe and he's not Jim Comey, so he's having to do a little bit of cleanup.
[00:09:33.704 --> 00:09:39.147]  But these are really bad facts if you care about an impartial, objective Department of Justice and FBI.
[00:09:40.263 --> 00:09:46.245]  I want to go to the other part of the text messages that goes to this question of conspiracy.
[00:09:46.245 --> 00:09:50.966]  Because as Ed Henry laid out, the timeline on all of this is very problematic.
[00:09:50.966 --> 00:09:54.727]  This is a text message from Peter Strzok to Lisa Page.
[00:09:54.727 --> 00:09:58.969]  I want to believe the path you threw out for consideration in Andy's office.
[00:09:58.969 --> 00:10:01.129]  That there's no way he gets elected.
[00:10:01.129 --> 00:10:03.390]  But I'm afraid we can't take that risk.
[00:10:04.284 --> 00:10:08.689]  It's like an insurance policy in the unlikely event that you die before you're 40.
[00:10:08.689 --> 00:10:15.938]  Now, you know, obviously everyone's going to try to figure out what he was going to do to make sure that you couldn't take that risk.
[00:10:15.938 --> 00:10:24.188]  But it would help everyone to understand that at the time that he said that, he was investigating Hillary Clinton to decide whether or not they were going to pursue charges against her.
[00:10:25.495 --> 00:10:32.259]  Yes ma'am, I'm still trying to figure out why three FBI agents are discussing politics in the Deputy Director's office.
[00:10:32.259 --> 00:10:39.482]  Because you're not supposed to discuss politics on federal ground, and FBI agents aren't supposed to engage in politics for Hatch Act reasons.
[00:10:39.482 --> 00:10:43.364]  Remember, we were supposed to interview Andy McCabe yesterday on another committee.
[00:10:43.364 --> 00:10:48.327]  It was all set up and ready to go, and then at the last minute they said, ah, he can't come Tuesday.
[00:10:48.847 --> 00:10:50.148]  He's going to come next week.
[00:10:50.148 --> 00:10:52.230]  I'll be shocked if he comes next week.
[00:10:52.230 --> 00:10:56.933]  I'll be a little bit surprised if he's still an employee of the FBI this time next week.
[00:10:56.933 --> 00:11:10.943]  But the notion that three bureau agents would be conspiring or plotting on how to handle the outcome of a presidential election is the opposite of what you want in an objective, dispassionate, neutral manner.
[00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:18.523]  Because they used taxpayer money to further buy and embellish and polish the turd that was the Fusion GPS.
[00:11:18.523 --> 00:11:28.808]  And then money went to the head Justice Department official over all Russian operations to his wife who was heading the operation in Fusion GPS.
[00:11:28.808 --> 00:11:30.109]  How much money did she get?
[00:11:30.109 --> 00:11:33.711]  They're saying it looks like she's paid a half million a year.
[00:11:33.711 --> 00:11:40.394]  Imagine how lazy these people are to produce one fake report about people peeing on folks.
[00:11:43.010 --> 00:11:45.352]  I mean, that's the laziness of this scum.
[00:11:45.352 --> 00:11:47.274]  Here's a half million dollars, lady!
[00:11:47.274 --> 00:11:50.116]  Just make up a report about a made-up event.
[00:11:50.116 --> 00:11:51.937]  Here, give me a half million.
[00:11:51.937 --> 00:11:54.700]  Trump was in a room with a bunch of hippopotamuses that crapped on him.
[00:11:54.700 --> 00:11:59.984]  And there were Keebler elves there, watching, and they videotaped the whole thing.
[00:11:59.984 --> 00:12:03.447]  And there were naked monkeys swinging from chandeliers.
[00:12:03.447 --> 00:12:05.929]  I mean, it's not true, and they admit it's a fraud.
[00:12:05.929 --> 00:12:07.570]  These people are insane!
[00:12:07.570 --> 00:12:11.334]  And I've got a bunch of other clips we're going to get to here.
[00:12:12.366 --> 00:12:14.468]  But it just gets crazier and crazier.
[00:12:14.468 --> 00:12:15.548]  I like this clip.
[00:12:15.548 --> 00:12:28.278]  Democrat representative says everybody, our favorite Democrat that called for me to be censored live three weeks ago in Congress, Wigley, and of course also Mr. Cohen made similar comments.
[00:12:28.278 --> 00:12:37.184]  He actually worked to get the Jesse Ventura show canceled and openly talked about it and said there's no such thing as FEMA camps or plans to target conservatives.
[00:12:37.184 --> 00:12:39.546]  I remember Congressman Cohen of Tennessee.
[00:12:39.546 --> 00:12:40.767]  So we're going to go to this clip.
[00:12:42.264 --> 00:12:51.396]  Where they're talking about this and they say everybody respects Mueller and then Gohmert pops in from Texas.
[00:12:52.597 --> 00:12:53.718]  I don't.
[00:12:53.718 --> 00:12:56.861]  Because you can't speak for everybody.
[00:12:56.861 --> 00:13:00.263]  Mueller has been a dirty FBI agent from the beginning.
[00:13:00.263 --> 00:13:02.786]  That's why he's been put in charge of things.
[00:13:02.786 --> 00:13:06.409]  Because he is a horrible, evil person.
[00:13:06.409 --> 00:13:07.930]  He covered up for the Clintons.
[00:13:07.930 --> 00:13:09.251]  He covered up for Obama.
[00:13:09.251 --> 00:13:10.412]  He covered up for the Bushes.
[00:13:10.412 --> 00:13:11.733]  He covered up for everything.
[00:13:11.733 --> 00:13:13.795]  And he thinks he's the president of this country.
[00:13:13.795 --> 00:13:14.355]  And he's not.
[00:13:14.355 --> 00:13:14.856]  So here it is.
[00:13:15.620 --> 00:13:17.481]  FBI Director Wray agrees with you.
[00:13:17.481 --> 00:13:24.385]  He said that the similar thoughts, he said he was a smart lawyer, a dedicated public servant, well-respected within the FBI.
[00:13:24.385 --> 00:13:28.847]  I think everybody on the other side of the aisle agreed with you when you appointed him.
[00:13:28.847 --> 00:13:37.672]  And everybody in this Judiciary Committee and probably everybody in this Congress agreed with his appointment as FBI Director, which was unanimous.
[00:13:37.672 --> 00:13:42.135]  His reappointment, which was unanimous by Republican Bush and Democrat Obama.
[00:13:43.058 --> 00:13:45.660]  Everybody respects that man in this country.
[00:13:45.660 --> 00:13:48.322]  I didn't, I don't.
[00:13:48.322 --> 00:13:52.124]  Obviously we knew that would be an exception.
[00:13:52.124 --> 00:13:54.646]  You hear him pop in and say, I don't.
[00:13:54.646 --> 00:13:56.508]  So that's the type of garbage we're dealing with.
[00:13:56.508 --> 00:13:57.748]  More of these clips coming up.
[00:13:57.748 --> 00:13:59.370]  I want to open the phones up as well.
[00:13:59.370 --> 00:14:00.691]  The toll free number to join us is 877-789-ALEX.

[00:14:43.056 --> 00:14:46.478]  A lot of jihad news as well.
[00:14:46.478 --> 00:14:48.460]  But first off here, ladies and gentlemen, before we go to break,

[00:18:09.227 --> 00:18:17.631]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[00:18:17.631 --> 00:18:22.513]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.

[00:20:11.621 --> 00:20:15.447]  We're all living in America!
[00:20:15.447 --> 00:20:17.110]  America!
[00:20:17.110 --> 00:20:19.334]  It's wonderful!
[00:20:19.334 --> 00:20:22.679]  We're all living in America!
[00:20:41.033 --> 00:20:47.194]  I'm Alex Jones, your host, and this is the Info War.
[00:20:47.194 --> 00:20:52.336]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:20:52.336 --> 00:20:58.097]  Let me now burrow into the big military news, and then coming up in the next segment, I'm going to open the phones up.
[00:20:58.097 --> 00:21:10.180]  But if you just joined us, we've got more of these clips from congressional testimony yesterday, and congressmen and others that were part of the hearing, then making statements after it, like Trey Gowdy foreshadowing
[00:21:12.324 --> 00:21:31.875]  That they think McCabe will be out by next week for violating the Hatch Act, being caught colluding with the entire team on how to fix the investigation into Russiagate during the campaign to torpedo Donald Trump as their American duty to stop those dirty American voters.
[00:21:31.875 --> 00:21:39.839]  And they see how the economy and the military has come back and the borders and yeah, absolutely, they got to stop that immediately.
[00:21:41.578 --> 00:21:45.721]  Because it's all a big Russian conspiracy that's brought all this... Thank you, Putin!
[00:21:45.721 --> 00:21:48.784]  But getting serious, obviously Putin has nothing to do with it.
[00:21:48.784 --> 00:21:54.668]  Other than Russia getting out of globalism, kicking out some of their own oligarchs has been an example to us.
[00:21:54.668 --> 00:21:56.070]  Now a bunch of other countries are doing it, so...
[00:21:57.133 --> 00:21:58.153]  Countries go in cycles.
[00:21:58.153 --> 00:22:00.814]  You know, we pulled out of a tyranny in 1776.
[00:22:00.814 --> 00:22:02.675]  We've been involved, leading the world in that.
[00:22:02.675 --> 00:22:06.577]  And then Russia went under globalist control, communist control, for 80-something years.
[00:22:06.577 --> 00:22:07.757]  And they've come out of it.
[00:22:07.757 --> 00:22:08.618]  They're trying to reform.
[00:22:08.618 --> 00:22:09.618]  And they're an example to us.
[00:22:09.618 --> 00:22:12.919]  And we've got a bunch of parasite globalists here, mad at Russia.
[00:22:12.919 --> 00:22:15.040]  So I guess that, in a way, is true.
[00:22:15.040 --> 00:22:17.321]  It's a Russian-led event.
[00:22:17.321 --> 00:22:19.562]  The Russians led the event to crush ISIS.
[00:22:19.562 --> 00:22:22.883]  Our military wanted to join in, told Obama they weren't going to help ISIS.
[00:22:22.883 --> 00:22:24.444]  Now ISIS has basically been crushed.
[00:22:25.947 --> 00:22:28.790]  But here's the new big news, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:22:28.790 --> 00:22:30.691]  North Korea.
[00:22:30.691 --> 00:22:36.577]  Trump talking dangerous step to nuclear war by seeking naval blockade.
[00:22:36.577 --> 00:22:40.220]  And if you actually look at what's going on, there is a giant naval force there.
[00:22:40.220 --> 00:22:41.661]  The sanctions have intensified.
[00:22:41.661 --> 00:22:42.862]  I don't like North Korea.
[00:22:42.862 --> 00:22:44.143]  I can't stand the North Korean regime.
[00:22:44.143 --> 00:22:45.204]  I love their people.
[00:22:45.204 --> 00:22:47.747]  I feel so sorry for them.
[00:22:47.747 --> 00:22:50.089]  But at the same time, you've got to be honest and realize
[00:22:52.887 --> 00:23:12.396]  That a new large war there would probably turn into a nuclear war very very quickly and we need to listen to what Vladimir Putin is saying because they've got over 10,000 operable working nuclear weapons and they have a border with North Korea and with China and are right in the middle of this show.
[00:23:12.396 --> 00:23:17.338]  US provoked North Korea to break the nuke agreement is what Putin is saying in one clip
[00:23:18.098 --> 00:23:19.059]  Then he says the U.S.
[00:23:19.059 --> 00:23:21.621]  has de facto missile treaty, has left it.
[00:23:21.621 --> 00:23:23.924]  Russia is not going to.
[00:23:23.924 --> 00:23:24.704]  Putin says the U.S.
[00:23:24.704 --> 00:23:28.628]  hurts itself with invented Trump collusion case.
[00:23:28.628 --> 00:23:30.730]  So we'll get into all of those points.
[00:23:30.730 --> 00:23:33.813]  But what Putin's saying is you are headed to war.
[00:23:33.813 --> 00:23:35.495]  It's going to get out of control.
[00:23:35.495 --> 00:23:37.877]  Please stop.
[00:23:37.877 --> 00:23:39.639]  Let's try to somehow work this out.
[00:23:39.639 --> 00:23:43.082]  But I get Trump's point of we've been 30 years of strategic
[00:23:44.315 --> 00:23:47.076]  Tension and strategic patience.
[00:23:47.076 --> 00:23:49.477]  And North Korea is out of control, threatening everybody.
[00:23:49.477 --> 00:23:54.640]  So, North Korea is to blame for most of this, but I get detente.
[00:23:54.640 --> 00:23:58.661]  I get not wanting a new giant war where people die on all sides.
[00:23:58.661 --> 00:24:02.083]  I mean, this is just a tender box.
[00:24:03.203 --> 00:24:04.645]  But let's play this clip first.
[00:24:04.645 --> 00:24:05.666]  Putin says U.S.
[00:24:05.666 --> 00:24:09.812]  hurts itself with invented Trump collusion case.
[00:24:09.812 --> 00:24:10.793]  Which it is.
[00:24:10.793 --> 00:24:12.976]  Tearing our country apart.
[00:24:12.976 --> 00:24:15.320]  And it's as phony as a $3 bill.
[00:24:15.320 --> 00:24:16.742]  So let's go ahead and go to that clip.
[00:24:20.125 --> 00:24:22.985]  Well, that's been brought in by the nose, you know.
[00:24:22.985 --> 00:24:25.206]  That's been invented by those who are in the opposition.
[00:24:39.731 --> 00:24:44.455]  People who oppose President Trump to delegitimize his time in office.
[00:24:44.455 --> 00:24:48.058]  You know, it really seems strange to me because they don't understand
[00:24:58.246 --> 00:25:01.127]  It seems that they don't understand.
[00:25:01.127 --> 00:25:07.810]  They undermine their own nation.
[00:25:07.810 --> 00:25:12.252]  They limit the powers of the president who's been elected.
[00:25:12.252 --> 00:25:19.415]  It means that they don't have respect for those people, for those Americans who elected Donald Trump.
[00:25:19.415 --> 00:25:19.995]  And that's it!
[00:25:19.995 --> 00:25:20.776]  Vladimir Putin!
[00:25:25.430 --> 00:25:28.875]  Your media, your political elite, do not respect the American people.
[00:25:28.875 --> 00:25:30.277]  They do not respect you.
[00:25:30.277 --> 00:25:34.644]  And they're trying to overthrow your will and what you did constitutionally.
[00:25:34.644 --> 00:25:38.250]  And we've caught the FBI and the Justice Department.
[00:25:39.554 --> 00:26:04.528]  Working with leftist groups in Russia to try to dummy up fake witnesses, and it's all falling through, it's not real, to frame our elected president, who in one year being president-elect, not even one year being in office, it's ten and a half months right now, has delivered at a unbelievable level.
[00:26:04.528 --> 00:26:05.408]  I mean, it's just a fact.
[00:26:05.408 --> 00:26:08.130]  If you look at the list of accomplishments, it's stunning.
[00:26:09.656 --> 00:26:15.338]  And that's why they're always running around saying that he hasn't delivered, Trump hasn't delivered in any way.
[00:26:15.338 --> 00:26:20.960]  And he has no accomplishments, because the accomplishments are dizzying.
[00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:29.144]  We're going to come back from break and play some more of the Putin clips, then go to your phone calls.
[00:26:29.144 --> 00:26:29.664]  877-789-ALEX.
[00:26:29.664 --> 00:26:33.725]  Wide open phones, ladies and gentlemen, any topic you want to discuss.
[00:26:33.725 --> 00:26:35.286]  Again, ladies and gentlemen,
[00:26:36.462 --> 00:26:37.562]  Christmas is here.
[00:26:37.562 --> 00:26:38.923]  We've got Christmas week sales.
[00:26:38.923 --> 00:26:42.964]  I'm calling it Christmas week, the week before the week of Christmas, the final week before Christmas.
[00:26:42.964 --> 00:26:48.566]  We have store-wide free shipping at infowarestore.com.
[00:26:48.566 --> 00:26:55.768]  And it's the money we make in the last month of the year that is always the extra money we have to either stay the same size or expand.
[00:26:55.768 --> 00:27:02.870]  This is the month where profit really, really happens, as everybody knows, that runs retail stores online or on the street.
[00:27:02.870 --> 00:27:03.931]  It's always November, December.
[00:27:05.115 --> 00:27:07.016]  We had some months this year that were better than last year.
[00:27:07.016 --> 00:27:10.998]  We had some months this year that were not as good as last year.
[00:27:10.998 --> 00:27:12.178]  It was a big election year.
[00:27:12.178 --> 00:27:18.881]  December this year is doing better for most people, because of Trump and the rest of it, but not for InfoWars.
[00:27:18.881 --> 00:27:22.883]  So we need people to really think about doing their Christmas shopping at InfoWars store.
[00:27:23.823 --> 00:27:24.824]  We're good to go.
[00:27:39.560 --> 00:27:43.644]  Please spread the articles and the videos at InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[00:27:43.644 --> 00:27:47.347]  Please sign up for our free newsletter at InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter.
[00:27:47.347 --> 00:27:49.729]  So they try to censor us, you can still get the videos and articles.
[00:27:49.729 --> 00:27:51.050]  That goes out twice a day.
[00:27:51.050 --> 00:27:55.253]  And please think about shopping with the good guys at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:27:55.253 --> 00:27:57.075]  They're like war bonds.
[00:27:57.075 --> 00:27:57.816]  50% off store wide.
[00:27:58.416 --> 00:28:00.957]  Part of the Christmas spectacular extravaganza sale.
[00:28:00.957 --> 00:28:06.998]  And Christmas is spectacular and extravagant, so I'm having some fun with that to rub it in the politically correct folks' nose.
[00:28:06.998 --> 00:28:11.520]  We are introducing the newest supplement in the InfoWars Life line.
[00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:12.780]  That is Alpha Power.
[00:28:12.780 --> 00:28:14.820]  50% off out of the gates.

[00:33:26.222 --> 00:33:31.184]  Waging war on corruption, crashing the lies and disinformation.
[00:33:31.184 --> 00:33:31.944]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[00:33:33.163 --> 00:33:42.331]  Vladimir Putin, in a large press briefing yesterday, made a lot of very interesting statements that I personally agree with.
[00:33:42.331 --> 00:33:45.754]  Not because I'm some Russian agent, but because I've done the research.
[00:33:45.754 --> 00:33:49.196]  He says the Russia narrative is totally fake, and that the Russia
[00:33:50.200 --> 00:34:04.479]  narrative being involved the election is a way to disrespect the American people and discount their votes well now that's been totally proven correct with the congressional hearings with the FBI director when he was deputy director we now have the emails
[00:34:05.300 --> 00:34:23.951]  And the notes from meetings saying we're going to keep Trump from getting an office, we're going to make up the Russia stuff, violating the Hatch Act, and then all the people, Strzok and the rest of them involved with Fusion GPS and the head of the Justice Department operation running the Russia investigation, his wife at Fusion GPS getting taxpayer money.
[00:34:23.951 --> 00:34:30.535]  I was like, why'd they give him a couple million extra after they'd already been paid $11 million for the fake PPGate dossier?
[00:34:30.535 --> 00:34:32.076]  That's a lot of money for a piece of fiction.
[00:34:32.916 --> 00:34:35.979]  That's what, like, Stephen King gets paid.
[00:34:35.979 --> 00:34:41.625]  So it really is incredible, ladies and gentlemen, to see this.
[00:34:41.625 --> 00:34:49.713]  But expanding on that, Putin then got into the whole military situation.
[00:34:49.713 --> 00:34:51.515]  He says, U.S.
[00:34:51.515 --> 00:34:53.477]  has provoked North Korea to break
[00:34:54.887 --> 00:34:55.327]  of course.
[00:35:18.780 --> 00:35:26.947]  That's reportedly going to stop some North Korean ships they think are carrying weapons to the Middle East and other areas like Iran.
[00:35:26.947 --> 00:35:30.690]  And they've been caught before shipping weapons to Central Asia and the Middle East.
[00:35:30.690 --> 00:35:33.413]  They just got caught a few months ago.
[00:35:33.413 --> 00:35:35.575]  So what happens if North Korean ships fight back?
[00:35:36.678 --> 00:35:39.521]  Then that's how things escalate very, very quickly.
[00:35:39.521 --> 00:35:42.363]  And the North says they'll attack Seoul, South Korea.
[00:35:42.363 --> 00:35:44.585]  They're just 30 miles away from North Korea.
[00:35:44.585 --> 00:35:49.369]  Trump taking dangerous step to nuclear war by seeking naval blockade.
[00:35:49.369 --> 00:35:50.951]  Is it really a blockade?
[00:35:50.951 --> 00:35:52.953]  You could argue it is, and that is an act of war.
[00:35:52.953 --> 00:35:53.133]  U.S.
[00:35:53.133 --> 00:35:58.117]  President Donald Trump is taking an extremely dangerous and big step towards nuclear war by seeking a naval blockade.
[00:35:58.117 --> 00:36:02.081]  North Korea has stated, according to official NCNA news agency.
[00:36:03.564 --> 00:36:08.426]  The North Korean government also said it was merciless self-defense.
[00:36:09.965 --> 00:36:11.326]  Kim Jong-un eating everybody's food.
[00:36:11.326 --> 00:36:12.667]  Everybody's skinny but him.
[00:36:12.667 --> 00:36:14.269]  Measures against any blockade.
[00:36:14.269 --> 00:36:16.610]  Why don't you send yourself out to fight then, bro?
[00:36:16.610 --> 00:36:19.553]  As it would consider such a move an act of war.
[00:36:19.553 --> 00:36:32.722]  The North Korean government also believes any blockade would be a wanton violation of the sovereignty and dignity of the bloodthirsty satanic vampire, excuse me, KCNA reported, citing a foreign ministry spokesperson.
[00:36:32.722 --> 00:36:34.304]  So let's hear what Vladimir Putin
[00:36:34.904 --> 00:36:38.765]  Who has a country that he leads, he's been elected to, bordering North Korea.
[00:36:38.765 --> 00:36:40.405]  Let's hear what he had to say about it yesterday.
[00:36:40.405 --> 00:36:53.087]  I would like to repeat that basically there was an agreement with North Korea in 2005 that they will suspend their nuclear program and they've made certain commitments.
[00:36:53.087 --> 00:36:56.248]  And everybody was happy, we all agreed and signed this agreement.
[00:36:56.248 --> 00:37:00.709]  Then a few months later the United States decided to go beyond this agreement.
[00:37:01.349 --> 00:37:13.601]  And they froze their assets, their bank accounts of North Korea, and they said that North Korea should do something in addition to this agreement, something that goes beyond that agreement.
[00:37:13.601 --> 00:37:20.007]  North Korea then withdrew from this agreement and relaunched its nuclear program.
[00:37:20.007 --> 00:37:21.068]  Why did you do that?
[00:37:22.549 --> 00:37:23.789]  This agreement was not enough.
[00:37:23.789 --> 00:37:27.011]  Why did you sign this agreement if you thought this was not enough?
[00:37:27.011 --> 00:37:31.053]  You provoked North Korea to withdraw from this agreement.
[00:37:31.053 --> 00:37:33.315]  And then it was even worse.
[00:37:33.315 --> 00:37:35.336]  There was Libya and Iraq.
[00:37:35.336 --> 00:37:37.577]  I mentioned this many times.
[00:37:37.577 --> 00:37:40.899]  To North Korea, this is the only way of self-preservation.
[00:37:40.899 --> 00:37:41.860]  They have to have
[00:37:43.221 --> 00:37:50.452]  WMDs and missiles and now they have a missile that can reach the United States.
[00:37:50.452 --> 00:37:52.435]  Apparently, apparently.
[00:37:52.435 --> 00:37:55.179]  So what good came out of it?
[00:37:55.179 --> 00:37:57.122]  We think both sides should stop.
[00:37:58.723 --> 00:38:01.805]  Escalating the situation.
[00:38:01.805 --> 00:38:10.091]  So, I think we heard from the United States that they would stop military drills.
[00:38:10.091 --> 00:38:10.831]  No, no.
[00:38:10.831 --> 00:38:16.935]  They have another military exercise and North Korea responded by launching another missile.
[00:38:16.935 --> 00:38:18.856]  You have to stop at a certain point.
[00:38:18.856 --> 00:38:21.338]  You have to stop this from spiraling.
[00:38:22.378 --> 00:38:36.725]  This is extremely dangerous and we told the United States about this even if you suppose that the United States launched some kind of strike against North Korea even if it's a conventional weapons if it's high-precision missiles
[00:38:38.246 --> 00:38:40.247]  Where are you going to strike?
[00:38:40.247 --> 00:38:45.429]  Does the CIA know specifically which targets they have to hit?
[00:38:45.429 --> 00:38:46.690]  No, of course not.
[00:38:46.690 --> 00:38:49.551]  North Korea is a closed country.
[00:38:49.551 --> 00:38:53.613]  There are things you may know about it and things that you certainly don't know.
[00:38:55.574 --> 00:39:00.458]  If North Korea launches its missiles, consequences will be catastrophic.
[00:39:00.458 --> 00:39:06.822]  Yes, we know that there was an instance when the United States used nuclear weapons.
[00:39:06.822 --> 00:39:10.284]  There was one instance when the U.S.
[00:39:10.284 --> 00:39:12.886]  used nuclear weapons against Japan.
[00:39:12.886 --> 00:39:15.668]  And even back then, I think it was unwarranted.
[00:39:15.668 --> 00:39:21.932]  But now, this will be extremely, extremely dangerous if they do that with North Korea.
[00:39:23.928 --> 00:39:35.777]  Okay, very very important information obviously there, and we don't want to have a wider war, and all it does, increasing sanctions and the rest of North Korea, is starve more of their people that are in a giant death cult.
[00:39:35.777 --> 00:39:38.759]  But you can't let North Korea fire missiles and threaten to attack their neighbors.
[00:39:38.759 --> 00:39:41.821]  It's just, it's out of control.
[00:39:41.821 --> 00:39:46.785]  And the North Korean leader needs to leave, he needs to step down, he needs to be removed.
[00:39:46.785 --> 00:39:51.789]  Now they just punched it up on screen a few minutes ago, and I was reading it during that clip we played.
[00:39:52.369 --> 00:39:53.910]  DrudgeReport.com.
[00:39:53.910 --> 00:39:57.932]  It's also up on InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[00:39:57.932 --> 00:40:00.474]  Speaker Ryan got the siren up there.
[00:40:00.474 --> 00:40:04.856]  Speaker Ryan to step aside and leave D.C.
[00:40:04.856 --> 00:40:14.421]  Man, we have got all of these RINO establishment Republicans reportedly that Intel has dirt on that are all just suddenly leaving.
[00:40:14.421 --> 00:40:15.882]  All these senators leaving.
[00:40:15.882 --> 00:40:17.163]  All these House members leaving.
[00:40:18.567 --> 00:40:32.955]  All these establishment globalists leaving, says despite all the accomplishments that Trump's gotten with him piled up, that he sees his wild Washington journey coming to an end, and that he will not seek re-election.
[00:40:32.955 --> 00:40:43.401]  He felt he was made for this moment, but now on the verge of achieving his long sought legislative dream, he's got his eyes on the exits, because he doesn't want to share the ticket with Trump in 2020.
[00:40:43.401 --> 00:40:43.561]  What?
[00:40:47.449 --> 00:40:48.951]  There's a lot of thought goes into this.
[00:40:48.951 --> 00:40:52.796]  A lot of them are having to step down because they're rhino senators and are involved in corruption.
[00:40:52.796 --> 00:40:54.739]  We know that.
[00:40:54.739 --> 00:40:56.261]  Let's get Roger Stone on as quick as we can.
[00:40:56.261 --> 00:40:57.062]  Call him right now, guys.
[00:40:57.062 --> 00:40:58.745]  I'm gonna go to your calls too, but just call Roger.
[00:41:00.401 --> 00:41:02.663]  But then they've got a lot of people quitting and leaving.
[00:41:02.663 --> 00:41:17.453]  They're saying to take away the Republican majority, to sabotage that, to make sure that this whole agenda to restore the Republic, return power back to Washington, back to the states, back to the people, from the offshore globalists, this is a way to scuttle it.
[00:41:17.453 --> 00:41:22.936]  And whether that was originally the case or not, the Republican blue blood, rhino, neocon,
[00:41:23.897 --> 00:41:26.699]  Globalist group that are just another wing of the Democratic Party.
[00:41:26.699 --> 00:41:28.961]  You know, the whole McCain types.
[00:41:28.961 --> 00:41:35.706]  They are now making lemonade out of lemons and saying, oh, we're all just leaving because we're not going to be part of this Trump thing.
[00:41:35.706 --> 00:41:40.169]  And we're going to go for the Democrats in our states.
[00:41:40.169 --> 00:41:42.310]  And you saw that in Alabama.
[00:41:42.310 --> 00:41:45.773]  So the swap is deadly and the swap is striking back.
[00:41:45.773 --> 00:41:52.518]  And it ties into what Drudge and what Roger Stone and myself, it was first Drudge warning of it and now Assange.
[00:41:53.894 --> 00:42:00.058]  Have been talking about Trump being sucked dry before the installation of President Pence.
[00:42:00.058 --> 00:42:04.621]  That's a NewsWars.com article that needs to get out and people need to look at it.
[00:42:04.621 --> 00:42:08.983]  But we'll give you more details from the Politico story that's up on InfoWars.com.
[00:42:09.984 --> 00:42:11.965]  Uh, when we come back, we're gonna go to your calls.

[00:42:20.127 --> 00:42:28.150]  But yes, if you see Paul Ryan's unfavorable trend, and we've got those polls up on screen, we'll cover more when we come back, they are STRATOSPHERIC!
[00:42:30.199 --> 00:42:35.621]  Paul Ryan laughs off suggestions he'll quit Congress after tax reform.
[00:42:35.621 --> 00:42:40.262]  That is a report out today from the Examiner counteracting that report.
[00:42:40.262 --> 00:42:41.142]  We'll see.
[00:42:41.142 --> 00:42:44.623]  We'll get to the bottom of it one way or another.
[00:42:44.623 --> 00:42:51.025]  But the neocons, the Democrats, they're all as unpopular as gonorrhea, cancer, and death.
[00:42:51.025 --> 00:42:51.845]  I'm Alex Jones.

[00:47:21.951 --> 00:47:28.205]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:47:52.179 --> 00:47:58.702]  I'm a little late getting back in studio here because we're trying to find out exactly what's going on with Paul Ryan.
[00:47:58.702 --> 00:48:04.385]  The big story up on InfoWars.com and DrugsReport.com in red with a siren.
[00:48:04.385 --> 00:48:07.687]  Paul Ryan sees his wild Washington journey coming to an end.
[00:48:07.687 --> 00:48:12.770]  They reportedly talked to folks close to him and to him and then he thinks he'll leave rather than be associated with Trump.
[00:48:13.670 --> 00:48:18.132]  That way he can have his cake and eat it too, and he'll be a good little rhino.
[00:48:18.132 --> 00:48:26.654]  But then he also told, and reportedly, the Washington Examiner that he laughs off suggestion he'll quit Congress after the tax reform bill.
[00:48:26.654 --> 00:48:27.975]  So this just broke.
[00:48:27.975 --> 00:48:33.317]  I'm gonna get Roger Stone's expert critique on this right now, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:48:33.317 --> 00:48:42.300]  But the big question is, if Paul Ryan really is gonna quit Congress and not run again, as Politico is reporting, then
[00:48:43.536 --> 00:48:44.757]  Why is he really quitting?
[00:48:44.757 --> 00:48:49.859]  Because we know a lot of folks have been pressured out because of things that have been discovered about them.
[00:48:49.859 --> 00:48:52.900]  And why have we seen so many Republican senators leave?
[00:48:52.900 --> 00:48:57.322]  Why so many Republican House members who are all rhinos or neocons?
[00:48:57.322 --> 00:48:58.263]  That's the big question.
[00:48:58.263 --> 00:48:59.803]  Why have all of them left?
[00:48:59.803 --> 00:49:08.047]  Because they're trying to spin it that, oh, we're leaving so Trump doesn't have the votes, and we're leaving in states that are kind of purple to throw it to the Democrats because Trump's so bad.
[00:49:08.047 --> 00:49:09.768]  But we know early on it was because they were,
[00:49:10.368 --> 00:49:13.270]  Under criminal investigation and other issues.
[00:49:13.270 --> 00:49:17.933]  What's the truth here from your research, Roger Stone?
[00:49:17.933 --> 00:49:26.258]  Well Alex, my sources tell me that Paul Ryan is trying to manage two problems and therefore I think this leak is credible.
[00:49:26.258 --> 00:49:38.105]  First is the fact that he was aware of the Awan brothers, the two Pakistani IT consultants who penetrated the House of Representatives computer system.
[00:49:39.006 --> 00:49:51.349]  He stole over $16 million and were able to access the email back and forth of 45 individual members.
[00:49:51.349 --> 00:49:55.630]  He knew about this as early as last September.
[00:49:55.630 --> 00:50:01.532]  Would have been a bombshell issue for the Republicans, a big boost to Trump.
[00:50:02.324 --> 00:50:09.890]  But rather than bring this forward to the American people, Ryan covered it up until January.
[00:50:09.890 --> 00:50:26.364]  Secondarily, I think we're going to learn, as we reported exclusively and first on InfoWars, when Republican money man and hedge fund manager Paul Singer financed the first iteration of the so-called dirty dossier.
[00:50:27.273 --> 00:50:30.176]  What you termed PPGate.
[00:50:30.176 --> 00:50:37.123]  I believe we're going to learn that Paul Ryan knew about it and was involved in that subterfuge to undermine Trump.
[00:50:38.083 --> 00:50:38.823]  Well, that makes sense.
[00:50:38.823 --> 00:50:43.265]  He was backing Jeb Bush at the time, even though Jeb Bush had two percentage points in most polls.
[00:50:43.265 --> 00:50:50.668]  He got more money than all the other 16 Republicans combined, and Paul Ryan was out there, you know, gallivanting around.
[00:50:50.668 --> 00:50:59.372]  So, this just goes on and on, and of course, he was the buddy-buddy with Mitt Ryan all along and his running mate, and so that makes perfect sense.
[00:50:59.372 --> 00:51:02.513]  Are you saying that's your guesstimation, or that's the intel you've got?
[00:51:03.359 --> 00:51:17.726]  That's the intel that I have that he's trying to manage both of these problems, which is why today's story now becomes entirely logical, that he would get out ahead of these two stories breaking.
[00:51:17.726 --> 00:51:21.148]  But I think that he's read the handwriting on the wall.
[00:51:21.148 --> 00:51:27.871]  Let's not forget, he suspended his support of candidate Trump towards the end of October.
[00:51:28.627 --> 00:51:35.693]  Trump won without him, and he has systematically worked to undermine the president since then.
[00:51:35.693 --> 00:51:44.440]  That said, the House's track record of passing Trump legislation is far, far superior to the Senate.
[00:51:44.440 --> 00:51:47.843]  I don't think anybody will be sorry to see Paul Ryan go.
[00:51:48.908 --> 00:51:53.490]  Now, this came out in Politico, and he basically says he's looking at it.
[00:51:53.490 --> 00:51:55.311]  The Washington Examiner does a lot of great work.
[00:51:55.311 --> 00:51:59.292]  They're saying that he's laughing it off, and I'm here trying to read both these articles.
[00:51:59.292 --> 00:52:09.577]  I mean, this just broke 10-15 minutes ago, and it sounds to me like he's testing the waters here in classic, fake conservative fashion.
[00:52:09.577 --> 00:52:12.098]  Either that or what we have here is a premature leak.
[00:52:13.047 --> 00:52:29.555]  And therefore this got out before he wanted it out, and therefore he's gonna prevaricate... Sure, sure, he wanted the tax reform victory first to make it look like he was a kind of a conservative, then segway out for a while, and then clean things up, and then try to come back in a presidential run?
[00:52:29.555 --> 00:52:38.619]  Well, I don't know that he comes back and runs for president, but I do think that he wants to get the kudos from Wall Street, because as you know, they have loaded up the president's
[00:52:39.492 --> 00:52:45.234]  A tax cut bill with a lot of benefits for Wall Street.
[00:52:45.234 --> 00:52:48.595]  There's a lot of favors in there for the big boys.
[00:52:48.595 --> 00:53:00.760]  So my guess is if he's looking for a soft landing, if he delivers for Wall Street within the tax cut bill, he could then move on to a far more lucrative life.
[00:53:00.760 --> 00:53:03.861]  As you know, Washington is a revolving door.
[00:53:04.844 --> 00:53:12.411]  Well, we've got a big favorable, unfavorable trend rating report that the Huffington Post is reporting on.
[00:53:12.411 --> 00:53:15.714]  It's, I guess, an index of different polls.
[00:53:15.714 --> 00:53:23.080]  But his unfavorable is just skyrocketing right now, upwards to 50 percent, 49.3.
[00:53:23.080 --> 00:53:24.502]  Favorable, 29.
[00:53:24.502 --> 00:53:27.324]  That's the left's little darling, like McCain.
[00:53:27.324 --> 00:53:28.966]  So that says a lot right there.
[00:53:30.795 --> 00:53:35.200]  Look, I think it would be positive if he leaves for the president.
[00:53:35.200 --> 00:53:42.267]  Of course, we're going to have an immediate squabble to see who would replace him, and it's early to do that handicapping.
[00:53:42.267 --> 00:53:45.330]  But if I had to place a bet today, I think he's going.
[00:53:45.330 --> 00:53:46.351]  You're absolutely right.
[00:53:46.351 --> 00:53:52.497]  He's waiting until he gets his kudos from Wall Street in the tax cut legislation before he announces it.
[00:53:52.777 --> 00:53:55.982]  Sure, I mean, why not get somebody real and hardcore?
[00:53:55.982 --> 00:54:00.770]  Why not get a Trey Gowdy or a Jim Jordan and not one of the guys that's proven he's an old party hack?
[00:54:00.770 --> 00:54:03.414]  Don't we want, you know, a Storm Trooper here?
[00:54:03.414 --> 00:54:04.876]  Don't we want a Shock Troop?
[00:54:04.876 --> 00:54:07.620]  Don't we want somebody like a Trey Gowdy or a Jim Jordan?
[00:54:08.732 --> 00:54:11.596]  Yeah, we need a firebrand, but as you know, the U.S.
[00:54:11.596 --> 00:54:14.700]  House of Representatives rarely works that way.
[00:54:14.700 --> 00:54:17.423]  Usually, it's the next guy in line.
[00:54:17.423 --> 00:54:18.585]  Yeah, it's like this royalty.
[00:54:18.585 --> 00:54:19.786]  I'm sick of this crap.
[00:54:19.786 --> 00:54:22.410]  We should have a popularity contest with conservative libertarians.
[00:54:23.678 --> 00:54:25.919]  We need somebody out of the Freedom Caucus.
[00:54:25.919 --> 00:54:30.760]  We need somebody who's a non-establishment free thinker.
[00:54:30.760 --> 00:54:32.441]  There's plenty of time for that.
[00:54:32.441 --> 00:54:38.423]  I guarantee you right now the handicapping and the crib sheets of vote counting have begun.
[00:54:38.423 --> 00:54:49.387]  Well sure, I mean, going off their normal fossilized imperial, you know, Egyptian style or British royalty style secession system, who's next in line for the royalty?
[00:54:50.901 --> 00:54:55.665]  I think it is whoever is the chairman of the conference.
[00:54:55.665 --> 00:54:59.508]  I think it's likely to be some established Republican non-entity.
[00:54:59.508 --> 00:55:02.270]  Look at the people who have held this job.
[00:55:02.270 --> 00:55:06.174]  So, we'll be digging into that almost immediately.
[00:55:06.174 --> 00:55:11.638]  Wouldn't it be great to have a firebrand like Trey Gowdy or Jim Jordan who are smart and actually care about the country?
[00:55:11.638 --> 00:55:13.639]  That would be great leadership.
[00:55:13.639 --> 00:55:15.041]  And tough, more importantly.
[00:55:15.041 --> 00:55:17.903]  Tough and as partisan as the Democrats are.
[00:55:18.610 --> 00:55:23.883]  No, it's funny because Paul Ryan comes from, you know, he claims to be an acolyte of Malay Jack Kemp.
[00:55:23.883 --> 00:55:25.387]  He comes from the right, but...
[00:55:26.033 --> 00:55:31.656]  He is really, particularly on immigration, he is particularly an establishment Republican.
[00:55:31.656 --> 00:55:34.737]  And he's a big leaker to the media and works with the globalists.
[00:55:34.737 --> 00:55:36.838]  He's such a piece of garbage.
[00:55:36.838 --> 00:55:39.539]  I've heard little birdies tell me there's a lot of dirt on him.
[00:55:39.539 --> 00:55:43.221]  Not just the hacking of his emails that the Democrats have been using, but a lot of stuff.
[00:55:43.221 --> 00:55:51.725]  So there's a lot of reasons why Eddie Munster, all grown up, why Eddie Munster meets Count Dracula, why Count Chocula is leaving.
[00:55:53.345 --> 00:56:02.841]  Well, so you've got the Awan Brothers cover-up, the Debbie Wasserman Schultz cover-up, you've got his connections to the dirty dossier.
[00:56:02.841 --> 00:56:07.089]  More than that, we don't know, but let's remember, we're still waiting for the list of Congress
[00:56:07.808 --> 00:56:13.031]  I'm not saying that Ryan's on the list, but what does he know about the list?
[00:56:13.031 --> 00:56:15.092]  And why hasn't he told us who's on the list?
[00:56:15.092 --> 00:56:15.812]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:56:33.874 --> 00:56:34.595]  All right, folks.
[00:56:34.595 --> 00:56:38.618]  Now, I wanted to go to calls 30 minutes ago, but there's been so much breaking news.
[00:56:38.618 --> 00:56:42.082]  The whole next hour is your phone calls and a bunch of key clips and breaking news.
[00:56:42.082 --> 00:56:44.644]  But the big stuff like this breaks, we'll have to obviously pop in.
[00:56:44.644 --> 00:56:47.967]  Got some clips of Trump and his big speech on tax reform.
[00:56:47.967 --> 00:56:49.428]  Garish Day and more coming up next hour.
[00:56:49.428 --> 00:56:53.072]  But Kevin and Cindy and all of you, just go bam, bam, bam.
[00:56:54.042 --> 00:56:55.083]  I'm going to go to your calls.

[01:00:03.154 --> 01:00:11.478]  For every question they don't want you to ask, he has the answer they don't want you to hear.
[01:00:11.478 --> 01:00:14.600]  He is Alex Jones.
[01:00:14.600 --> 01:00:17.222]  NBC News is reporting it.
[01:00:18.363 --> 01:00:21.767]  As soon as we get an audio feed, we'll get this on air for you.
[01:00:21.767 --> 01:00:22.808]  This just broke.
[01:00:22.808 --> 01:00:32.339]  You know, we've had a lot of reportage, Dr. Corsi has, that's gone viral, about the death threats against Ajay Pai, the head of the FCC, and people saying they're going to kill him.
[01:00:33.280 --> 01:00:46.290]  Because he won't let Obama's net neutrality stay in, that lets Google, Facebook, Twitter censor everybody, and then have their own systems to throttle content, slow down content, block content, but then not let everybody else do it.
[01:00:46.290 --> 01:00:55.938]  Ajay Pai says go back to what we had that was closer to net neutrality, but that also lets companies, you know, have exclusive content, let people pay more to get better streaming from them.
[01:00:56.658 --> 01:00:57.760]  Which I'm not saying is perfect.
[01:00:57.760 --> 01:01:05.831]  This stuff's like making sausage, and I've had top experts on, I've researched it, but definitely the Obama power grab, we know, was not net neutrality.
[01:01:05.831 --> 01:01:07.593]  It was a big step in the wrong direction.
[01:01:08.690 --> 01:01:13.515]  Uh, and so we've now, uh, gonna have that in the next segment, uh, some video of that.
[01:01:13.515 --> 01:01:16.879]  Uh, OGPi, it's up on InfoWars.com.
[01:01:16.879 --> 01:01:19.622]  Right now, they had a live video feed of the FCC.
[01:01:19.622 --> 01:01:20.323]  They had to cut it.
[01:01:20.323 --> 01:01:24.587]  Uh, I guess somebody attacked him, is what they're saying.
[01:01:24.587 --> 01:01:29.553]  Uh, so, uh, we've got all that, um, going on here.
[01:01:31.184 --> 01:01:34.286]  We're going to be breaking all of that down in the next segment.
[01:01:34.286 --> 01:01:35.167]  We're going to get that clip.
[01:01:35.167 --> 01:01:37.048]  It was tweeted out by NBC.
[01:01:37.048 --> 01:01:39.209]  We get that posted to Infowars.com.
[01:01:39.209 --> 01:01:43.171]  We'll have that for you in the next segment.
[01:01:43.171 --> 01:01:46.373]  Right now, though, let's go ahead and start taking phone calls.
[01:01:46.373 --> 01:01:48.235]  Let's talk to Kevin in West Virginia.
[01:01:48.235 --> 01:01:50.756]  Thank you for holding on this Thursday edition.
[01:01:50.756 --> 01:01:51.377]  Hey, Alex.
[01:01:51.377 --> 01:01:52.057]  Hey.
[01:01:52.057 --> 01:01:54.138]  I have a solution, I think, for Congress.
[01:01:54.138 --> 01:01:57.500]  And before I say it, I have two questions that go with my solution.
[01:01:57.500 --> 01:02:00.042]  I want to know if it's a plausible
[01:02:00.498 --> 01:02:01.679]  I think that's a great idea.
[01:02:01.679 --> 01:02:07.481]  That's been done throughout history before, that if people are part of a criminal conspiracy but they were brought into it under duress,
[01:02:24.983 --> 01:02:31.971]  Then under common law, if you go and throw yourself at the mercy of the court, they generally will let you off.
[01:02:31.971 --> 01:02:39.440]  If you've not been involved in treachery willingly, you kind of get your own pardon from the court, but it can be offered as a pardon.
[01:02:39.440 --> 01:02:43.284]  That's been done many times under British and English common law.
[01:02:44.325 --> 01:02:58.997]  It's also biblical, a Judaic law has those type of things in it, that if you were duressed into something, and then you come clean and help stop the larger conspiracy for the greater good, then you are given a pardon.
[01:02:58.997 --> 01:03:01.539]  That's a very good idea, Kevin.
[01:03:01.539 --> 01:03:06.783]  Alright, and I mean, I had heard this off of a few other people too, and I had, you know, had thought about it.
[01:03:06.783 --> 01:03:09.806]  The other thing that I wanted to mention to you was social contracts.
[01:03:10.640 --> 01:03:15.706]  Alabama has proven to me that we no longer have a social contract with the government.
[01:03:15.706 --> 01:03:24.356]  And then there's, you know, I've been thinking of trying to possibly rebirth page 2 of the Declaration of Independence.
[01:03:24.356 --> 01:03:28.461]  And I keep coming up with having, going to the International Court of Hague,
[01:03:28.925 --> 01:03:29.926]  Well, that's actually true.
[01:03:29.926 --> 01:03:34.833]  That'd be a way to reverse it, but then you'd have to be arguing that it has the plenary
[01:03:43.865 --> 01:03:44.285]  I don't know.
[01:04:06.158 --> 01:04:12.987]  Catalan and others went to the UN and said, hey, we want to be able to break away like Kosovo, because the Muslims said they were.
[01:04:12.987 --> 01:04:14.068]  And you said that was normal.
[01:04:14.068 --> 01:04:18.473]  But then when we want to break away, we have been here for thousands of years and are not Spanish.
[01:04:18.473 --> 01:04:19.615]  You tell us we can't.
[01:04:19.615 --> 01:04:22.879]  When the Albanians invaded, you said, oh, yes, you're Serbs.
[01:04:22.879 --> 01:04:24.821]  You can break away and be Kosovo folks.
[01:04:25.642 --> 01:04:30.324]  Uh, so it's totally hypocritical how that whole thing's been executed.
[01:04:30.324 --> 01:04:34.326]  Uh, so, you know, the UN only does it when they want to, but it's a good point.
[01:04:34.326 --> 01:04:35.947]  Kevin, very sophisticated points.
[01:04:35.947 --> 01:04:40.129]  Thank you for really upping my thought processes today, I gotta tell ya.
[01:04:40.129 --> 01:04:45.471]  Alright, Cindy, Colt, Alex, Issa, John, Frank, Aaron, Brian, your calls are all straight up.
[01:04:45.471 --> 01:04:49.573]  And Ajay Pai and his live transmission cut just minutes ago.
[01:04:49.573 --> 01:04:50.313]  Straight ahead.
[01:04:50.313 --> 01:04:51.434]  Have you spread the audio links?
[01:04:52.054 --> 01:04:58.200]  From Infowars.com, Newswars.com, we need you to.
[01:04:58.200 --> 01:05:01.163]  Top scientists and researchers agree.
[01:05:01.163 --> 01:05:10.312]  We are being hit by toxic weapons in the food and water supply that are making us fat, sick, and stupid.
[01:05:10.312 --> 01:05:11.674]  So what do we do about it?
[01:05:11.674 --> 01:05:14.777]  Well, for starters, don't just sit there and take it.
[01:05:14.997 --> 01:05:22.744]  Fight back with the all-new supercharged BrainForce Plus and feel the rush without the crash.
[01:05:22.744 --> 01:05:29.010]  BrainForce Plus is the next generation of advanced neural activation and nootropics.

[01:05:50.484 --> 01:05:51.784]  It's the real deal.
[01:05:51.784 --> 01:05:53.525]  Brain Force Plus.

[01:06:10.905 --> 01:06:20.070]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:20.070 --> 01:06:36.420]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are going back to your phone calls here in a moment, but NBC News is reporting that a FCC meeting in their press briefing room, the chairman of the FCC, Ajay Pai, has gotten a lot of death threats that Twitter and Facebook have allowed to stay up.
[01:06:37.506 --> 01:06:46.172]  They cut a live feed, some type of security crisis happened, and still we don't know exactly what's going on there according to NBC News.
[01:06:46.172 --> 01:06:47.233]  But we're following that.
[01:06:47.233 --> 01:06:53.817]  FCC evacuates during net neutrality vote on advice of security.
[01:06:53.817 --> 01:06:58.640]  And I guess something happened inside the meeting room.
[01:06:58.640 --> 01:07:02.263]  So we're going to go ahead and play that clip.
[01:07:02.263 --> 01:07:04.644]  Here it is.
[01:07:04.644 --> 01:07:06.766]  On advice of security, we need to take a brief recess.
[01:07:08.439 --> 01:07:14.625]  I need everyone to leave everything that you have in place.
[01:07:14.625 --> 01:07:23.332]  Do not take anything out of here except for your own body.
[01:07:23.332 --> 01:07:25.975]  That's the Google Mafia for you, the Facebook Twitter Mafia.
[01:07:25.975 --> 01:07:27.416]  They censor everybody.
[01:07:27.416 --> 01:07:28.477]  They admit they censor.
[01:07:28.477 --> 01:07:30.099]  They fix things for Hillary.
[01:07:30.099 --> 01:07:31.720]  They cover up the globalist crimes.
[01:07:31.720 --> 01:07:33.662]  They cut people off from commerce.
[01:07:33.662 --> 01:07:34.583]  They harass people.
[01:07:35.779 --> 01:07:38.920]  They're bragging in Congress live that we're censoring Alex Jones.
[01:07:38.920 --> 01:07:46.582]  And then they let, on Facebook, Twitter, you name it, everybody said we're going to kill Ajay Pai, kill Ajay Pai.
[01:07:46.582 --> 01:07:47.503]  And then nothing's done.
[01:07:47.503 --> 01:07:49.323]  So we'll see what goes on with that.
[01:07:49.323 --> 01:07:52.784]  And I've had big talks with lawyers, communication lawyers.
[01:07:52.784 --> 01:07:54.085]  I've had talks with other lawyers.
[01:07:54.085 --> 01:07:56.826]  I've interviewed experts on it.
[01:07:56.826 --> 01:08:00.527]  And what Ajay Pai is putting forward is what was there before.
[01:08:01.522 --> 01:08:07.426]  Obama put in a telecommunications bill and got it into law that allows them to censor.
[01:08:07.426 --> 01:08:08.827]  That's why this is all started.
[01:08:08.827 --> 01:08:10.768]  So we know what they did is bad!
[01:08:10.768 --> 01:08:17.232]  In fact, can you guys print me Ajay Pai's letter a week ago that I made such a big deal of because it was huge?
[01:08:17.232 --> 01:08:26.078]  Going, how dare you claim we're going to censor somebody when you were trying to hand it over to the UN and George Soros and you've been caught censoring everybody!
[01:08:26.078 --> 01:08:28.160]  I mean, that's what they're doing!
[01:08:29.551 --> 01:08:36.984]  Jordan Soros is being banned in Europe, he's being banned in Pakistan, he's being banned in Russia, he's being banned everywhere.
[01:08:36.984 --> 01:08:38.567]  He goes in and just takes over!
[01:08:40.848 --> 01:08:42.469]  That is just incredible.
[01:08:42.469 --> 01:08:43.390]  Russia is saying the U.S.
[01:08:43.390 --> 01:08:44.891]  and North Korea both need to cool it.
[01:08:44.891 --> 01:08:47.093]  Everybody's steaming towards war.
[01:08:47.093 --> 01:08:55.199]  We've got Paul Ryan saying, reportedly according to Politico, who is fake news sometimes, that he's going to be stepping down the next year.
[01:08:55.199 --> 01:08:59.982]  Now, reportedly, other publications are saying that that's not the case.
[01:08:59.982 --> 01:09:01.383]  That's the Washington Examiner.
[01:09:01.383 --> 01:09:06.187]  Paul Ryan laughs off suggestions he'll quit Congress after tax reform.
[01:09:06.187 --> 01:09:09.549]  Meanwhile, law firm, French government, aware of and aided
[01:09:10.866 --> 01:09:12.907]  1994, Rwanda genocide.
[01:09:12.907 --> 01:09:14.549]  I don't need a law firm to tell me.
[01:09:14.549 --> 01:09:33.120]  The UN sent in troops and helped the majority, non-Christian group, kill at least 800,000 people in a 100-day spree, because Christians controlled most of the country because of their culture, had the most wealth, because they didn't just kill each other, they produced wealth, and so they were killed by the animus group and the UN and oil companies to take the land.
[01:09:33.120 --> 01:09:34.541]  That story's up on Infowars.
[01:09:35.241 --> 01:09:45.590]  There's the article out of Reuters, Pakistan orders George Soros Foundation and other AIDS groups to close, so they're really multinational intelligence agencies.
[01:09:45.590 --> 01:09:48.553]  So we've got all that information as well.
[01:09:48.553 --> 01:09:56.340]  I've got a bunch of clips I haven't gotten to yet, and a lot of politics, and the so-called sexual misconduct news, the economy, all of it.
[01:09:56.340 --> 01:09:58.562]  But right now, let's go to your phone calls!
[01:10:00.230 --> 01:10:05.084]  to discuss whatever it is you want to talk about on this worldwide live Thursday transmission.
[01:10:05.084 --> 01:10:08.232]  And I'm Alex Jones, your host, NewsWars.com.
[01:10:09.562 --> 01:10:12.605]  InfoWars.com and of course PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:10:12.605 --> 01:10:13.705]  We're going to redo InfoWars.
[01:10:13.705 --> 01:10:14.586]  It's still a great site.
[01:10:14.586 --> 01:10:17.829]  A little bit old, a little bit hard to load on some smartphones.
[01:10:17.829 --> 01:10:22.533]  NewsWars is new, nice, quick moving, a lot of new things getting added to it.
[01:10:22.533 --> 01:10:24.154]  PrisonPlanet is quick to load as well.
[01:10:24.154 --> 01:10:26.236]  They all have original content.
[01:10:26.236 --> 01:10:33.301]  They're about 75% the same content, but about 25% is different original content.
[01:10:33.301 --> 01:10:36.884]  You'll only find on NewsWars or PrisonPlanet or InfoWars.
[01:10:36.884 --> 01:10:37.265]  And remember,
[01:10:38.519 --> 01:10:39.441]  I know you're awake.
[01:10:39.441 --> 01:10:40.222]  I know you're involved.
[01:10:40.222 --> 01:10:40.943]  You're incredible.
[01:10:40.943 --> 01:10:41.364]  Thank you.
[01:10:41.364 --> 01:10:46.834]  You're the reason we've gotten this far, but the globalists know they're losing now, so they're intensifying their operations.
[01:10:47.694 --> 01:10:53.881]  That's why now when you spread an article, when you spread a video, when you get the information out, no one else is going to do it if it's not you.
[01:10:53.881 --> 01:10:56.084]  So that's why you are the backbone of this.
[01:10:56.084 --> 01:11:04.353]  While Google, Facebook, Twitter, and all of them openly try to cut us back, block us, do this, it still gets out when you copy our videos to your YouTube channel.
[01:11:04.353 --> 01:11:05.254]  Don't have a YouTube channel?
[01:11:05.254 --> 01:11:06.396]  Start one.
[01:11:06.396 --> 01:11:08.178]  When you tell neighbors about the show or
[01:11:09.178 --> 01:11:16.884]  Make a copy of, you know, some of the broadcasts and give it to them on thumb drive, or get a presentplanet.tv membership and share it with them, or just point them in the right direction.
[01:11:16.884 --> 01:11:20.906]  It's those of you doing this that in the aggregate have changed the world.
[01:11:20.906 --> 01:11:22.888]  So we salute you and we thank you.
[01:11:22.888 --> 01:11:26.010]  I am thankful to God, number one, my family, and all of you.
[01:11:26.010 --> 01:11:28.071]  We are family, so thank you so much.
[01:11:28.071 --> 01:11:31.493]  And this great crew and everybody else, we're all doing it together.
[01:11:31.493 --> 01:11:34.735]  Cindy in Michigan, you're on the air.
[01:11:34.735 --> 01:11:35.736]  What's on your mind today?
[01:11:39.367 --> 01:11:42.830]  I think that the left is freaking out.
[01:11:42.830 --> 01:11:53.980]  They tried to get Trump with this false dossier stuff and now it's come out and it's a bunch of lies and they're all freaking out.
[01:11:53.980 --> 01:11:55.121]  So what did they do?
[01:11:55.121 --> 01:12:06.251]  They threw sexual harassment at him and now they have the accusers being proven that
[01:12:07.023 --> 01:12:10.605]  They have taken bribes and all of this.
[01:12:10.605 --> 01:12:16.209]  And what they did was they cut off their own arm.
[01:12:16.209 --> 01:12:24.735]  It was one of... The feminist movement is one of their go-to movements that they push at us all the time.
[01:12:24.735 --> 01:12:30.358]  And it has little arms, but they threw that at him.
[01:12:30.358 --> 01:12:33.060]  And now it's being destroyed.
[01:12:34.418 --> 01:12:41.963]  And it's great that the feminist movement has destroyed part of America.
[01:12:41.963 --> 01:12:48.148]  And it's great that it's now going to be cut.
[01:12:48.148 --> 01:12:51.250]  Well, ma'am, you can say what you want about Trump, or I can say what I want.
[01:12:52.216 --> 01:12:54.597]  You have globalists that hijacked the country.
[01:12:54.597 --> 01:13:02.999]  And they were transferring power out as fast as they could to the TPP, to the IMF, to the World Bank, to the WTO, and to themselves.
[01:13:02.999 --> 01:13:12.741]  Their wives, their husbands, chaired the boards, and then the Prime Ministers and others would literally transfer national power, taxation power, everything, to unelected secret groups.
[01:13:12.741 --> 01:13:16.963]  They would tell Congress, they would tell the UK Parliament, you can't see the agreement.
[01:13:16.963 --> 01:13:18.323]  So that's what Brexit
[01:13:19.508 --> 01:13:32.392]  And Trump pulling out of the TPP, and all of this is about us saying, no, we're removing power back to America, back to Washington, back to the states, back to the counties, back to the cities, back to the families, back to the individuals.
[01:13:32.392 --> 01:13:34.353]  And that's why they're mad.
[01:13:34.353 --> 01:13:47.737]  They had successfully hijacked the country, but before they could set up a total global police state to stop us taking back control, we're using the old original systems that are constitutional and legitimate to take them out.
[01:13:48.749 --> 01:13:49.711]  Thank you so much for the call.
[01:13:49.711 --> 01:13:50.753]  Great point, Cindy.
[01:13:50.753 --> 01:13:51.835]  It'd be like if you owned a company.
[01:13:51.835 --> 01:13:53.137]  You hear about this all the time in the news.
[01:13:54.278 --> 01:13:56.159]  You've got people managing, you've got a couple companies.
[01:13:56.159 --> 01:13:58.200]  You kind of halfway retire and let somebody else kind of run it.
[01:13:58.200 --> 01:14:00.902]  All of a sudden you're not getting paid your yearly money or whatever.
[01:14:00.902 --> 01:14:04.805]  You're supposed to get a percentage of the profit because you have a manager that runs the company.
[01:14:04.805 --> 01:14:11.049]  And they try to go to the board of directors and kick you off and take it over and say that it's their company and you just waltz in and take it back.
[01:14:11.049 --> 01:14:14.851]  About 90% of the time, takeovers internally don't work.
[01:14:14.851 --> 01:14:22.236]  But delusional people get in the positions of believing that because they've been given power to make decisions that they are
[01:14:23.237 --> 01:14:24.957]  You know, the actual owners.
[01:14:24.957 --> 01:14:26.798]  Well, we the people are the owners.
[01:14:26.798 --> 01:14:28.078]  And we came home, and we're back.
[01:14:28.078 --> 01:14:30.198]  It's kind of like Ulysses.
[01:14:30.198 --> 01:14:35.519]  He's gone for 30 years or whatever, and he shows up, and men have taken over his farm, his plantation.
[01:14:35.519 --> 01:14:39.500]  And, you know, they're in there with his wife and daughters, basically beating him up, got him as slaves.
[01:14:39.500 --> 01:14:44.341]  And they've got a contest of who can shoot through all the axe heads.
[01:14:44.341 --> 01:14:46.661]  And he doesn't just kill them all himself up front.
[01:14:46.661 --> 01:14:50.462]  He first beats them all, shooting the arrow through all the axe heads.
[01:14:50.462 --> 01:14:52.422]  Proves he's better than them, then he kills them.
[01:14:53.911 --> 01:14:57.234]  And so that's an art type of what all this is about.
[01:14:57.234 --> 01:14:57.955]  Great points.
[01:14:57.955 --> 01:15:01.159]  We're going to come back and go right to Colt, Alex, Issa, Frank, and others.
[01:15:01.159 --> 01:15:02.460]  I'm going to bam, bam, bam, so get ready.
[01:15:02.460 --> 01:15:03.581]  I'm going to try as much as I can.
[01:15:03.581 --> 01:15:05.403]  That was a great point you made.
[01:15:05.403 --> 01:15:09.687]  Please don't forget, you've got a chance to get great products and be part of history.

[01:17:29.559 --> 01:17:31.200]  Are tax debts crippling you?

[01:17:58.240 --> 01:17:58.740]  Not a group.
[01:17:58.740 --> 01:18:00.201]  You developed Living Defense for us.
[01:18:00.201 --> 01:18:01.521]  It took you over a year to do it.
[01:18:01.521 --> 01:18:02.722]  Why is this so good?
[01:18:02.722 --> 01:18:08.004]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[01:18:08.004 --> 01:18:21.549]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[01:18:21.549 --> 01:18:22.910]  Right now with all the refugees,
[01:18:23.670 --> 01:18:25.332]  Uh, spreading disease around.
[01:18:25.332 --> 01:18:27.916]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[01:18:27.916 --> 01:18:29.218]  These are all parasites.
[01:18:29.218 --> 01:18:30.319]  Tell us about all the stuff that's in it.
[01:18:30.319 --> 01:18:31.661]  There's so many things that are in it.
[01:18:31.661 --> 01:18:36.167]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[01:18:36.167 --> 01:18:39.311]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[01:18:39.431 --> 01:18:42.494]  All right, well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[01:18:42.494 --> 01:18:43.535]  It just came back in yesterday.
[01:18:43.535 --> 01:18:45.476]  Living Defense, Infowarslife.com.
[01:18:45.476 --> 01:18:46.497]  And folks, you can't lose.

[01:18:52.482 --> 01:18:54.724]  Thank you, Dr. Group from the Global Healing Center.
[01:18:54.724 --> 01:18:57.907]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[01:18:57.907 --> 01:18:59.808]  Mike in Arizona, you're on the air worldwide.
[01:18:59.808 --> 01:19:00.109]  Go ahead.
[01:19:01.036 --> 01:19:02.979]  Oh, Alex, you can rant any day of the week.
[01:19:02.979 --> 01:19:13.494]  Thank you, sir, for doing what you do and being a patriot and doing your best to save America and encouraging us as fellow patriots to do that in our local areas as well.
[01:19:13.494 --> 01:19:16.859]  And as a longtime InfoWars listener, I want to say thanks.
[01:19:17.379 --> 01:19:17.739]  Thank you.
[01:19:17.739 --> 01:19:18.220]  Absolutely.
[01:19:39.335 --> 01:19:40.035]  Absolutely.
[01:19:40.035 --> 01:20:00.161]  Because then we could all, as educated patriots, help our other countrymen and women understand that there's bigger problems going on, and if we can get our houses in order, and be good to each other and ourselves, we can take our country back.
[01:20:00.161 --> 01:20:02.802]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:13.203 --> 01:20:21.908]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:21.908 --> 01:20:27.812]  We're going right to your phone calls, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:20:27.812 --> 01:20:29.593]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:20:29.593 --> 01:20:39.319]  And then when we start the next hour, Mark Dice is going to be joining us, a really smart guy that knew a lot of live stuff.
[01:20:39.319 --> 01:20:41.661]  And so it's always great to get him on radio.
[01:20:42.557 --> 01:20:43.679]  I'm always trying to convince him.
[01:20:43.679 --> 01:20:44.801]  I said, you're a really smart guy.
[01:20:44.801 --> 01:20:45.763]  You ought to do more live stuff.
[01:20:45.763 --> 01:20:47.245]  He goes, oh no, I like to do tape stuff.
[01:20:47.245 --> 01:20:50.230]  But I found he's just as savvy and does just as good a job.
[01:20:51.661 --> 01:20:53.922]  Live as he does.
[01:20:53.922 --> 01:20:55.964]  Tape, it's the same thing.
[01:20:55.964 --> 01:21:04.669]  But we're gonna cover the waterfront with Mark, get into fake news, get into the Globalist, get into some of the biggest stories of the year and what he thinks is coming up in the future.
[01:21:04.669 --> 01:21:07.371]  We'll also open the phones up so obviously we can talk to Mark Dice.
[01:21:07.371 --> 01:21:11.113]  We're also carrying his new book at Infowarstore.com.
[01:21:11.113 --> 01:21:13.334]  I forgot to tell you about that.
[01:21:13.334 --> 01:21:18.778]  By the way, before I go to your calls, just briefly, when I say a good probiotic,
[01:21:19.721 --> 01:21:21.062]  We'll change your life.
[01:21:21.062 --> 01:21:23.343]  Most people haven't ever had a probiotic.
[01:21:23.343 --> 01:21:26.705]  The bacteria have been killed in their gut because the pesticides in the food.
[01:21:26.705 --> 01:21:33.830]  It's a fact that somebody that's a lot older has a fraction of the bacteria they did when they were young, and a lot of them are the bad bacteria.
[01:21:33.830 --> 01:21:35.751]  And if you take a good probiotic, it'll change your life.
[01:21:35.751 --> 01:21:40.334]  We've got these amazing probiotics from one of the top labs in the country.
[01:21:41.377 --> 01:21:41.858]  Thank you.
[01:22:03.218 --> 01:22:06.541]  At 50% off, ladies and gentlemen, it's joke level.
[01:22:06.541 --> 01:22:11.724]  Other similar probiotics are $70 to $80 to get something this good.
[01:22:11.724 --> 01:22:13.406]  It's a good deal at $40.
[01:22:13.406 --> 01:22:17.689]  We've got it for $20 right now at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:22:18.922 --> 01:22:19.823]  Give it under the tree.
[01:22:19.823 --> 01:22:20.825]  Give it as a gift.
[01:22:20.825 --> 01:22:21.646]  Try it for yourself.
[01:22:21.646 --> 01:22:27.453]  I happen to know five people that work here that had irritable bowel or serious problems, and I'd hear about it.
[01:22:27.453 --> 01:22:32.140]  People that were healthy, working out, but because of the vaccines or not having enough good bacteria, it's all tied to it.
[01:22:32.140 --> 01:22:33.461]  They had serious bowel problems.
[01:22:34.202 --> 01:22:36.465]  One person had what you call Crohn's disease, they told him.
[01:22:36.465 --> 01:22:37.667]  The problems are gone!
[01:22:37.667 --> 01:22:41.471]  I'm not saying it's gonna happen like that for you, but that's why this is so important.
[01:22:41.471 --> 01:22:41.932]  Try it.
[01:22:41.932 --> 01:22:43.935]  Try the Real Red Pill.
[01:22:43.935 --> 01:22:45.577]  Try Alpha Power.
[01:22:45.577 --> 01:22:46.638]  Try it for yourself.
[01:22:46.638 --> 01:22:47.880]  Living Defense Parasite Cleanser.
[01:22:47.880 --> 01:22:48.961]  It's now back in stock.
[01:22:48.961 --> 01:22:50.002]  Caveman's now back in stock.
[01:22:50.723 --> 01:22:52.305]  Help us fund the operation.
[01:22:52.305 --> 01:22:56.689]  Infowarstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:22:56.689 --> 01:23:05.658]  And again, whether it's Anthroplex or whether it's Wintersun or any of these great products that have been sold out that are now back in stock, it helps fund our operation.
[01:23:05.658 --> 01:23:09.842]  And they've all got hundreds and hundreds, if not thousands, of reviews that are four-star.
[01:23:09.842 --> 01:23:11.884]  On average, 92% on the store.
[01:23:13.866 --> 01:23:16.428]  A lot of the new stuff doesn't have reviews yet, but believe me, it's going to be amazing.
[01:23:16.428 --> 01:23:17.889]  So again, thank you all.
[01:23:17.889 --> 01:23:19.030]  You're the reason we're here.
[01:23:19.030 --> 01:23:21.071]  Just plugging a lot because it's the Christmas season.
[01:23:21.071 --> 01:23:32.580]  I hope people will help fund the operation, give us a present, give themselves a present, their health a present, the country, the world a present, and not fight the traffic, not fight the crowds, and get great deals at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:23:32.580 --> 01:23:33.521]  Okay!
[01:23:33.521 --> 01:23:34.542]  Cult in Kansas!
[01:23:35.322 --> 01:23:36.623]  We've got it done.
[01:23:36.623 --> 01:23:42.448]  This transmission is coming to you.
[01:23:42.448 --> 01:23:46.832]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:23:46.832 --> 01:23:52.416]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[01:23:57.881 --> 01:23:59.102]  Well, that'll...
[01:24:15.356 --> 01:24:18.778]  That'll mess you up when you kick the cord out of the microphone.
[01:24:18.778 --> 01:24:23.340]  We're going to have to secure these a little bit better, I think.
[01:24:23.340 --> 01:24:25.420]  But I'm the one that likes the microphone on the table.
[01:24:25.420 --> 01:24:27.381]  Like, nobody ever really does this, this style.
[01:24:27.381 --> 01:24:29.102]  I started doing it and everybody does it.
[01:24:29.102 --> 01:24:31.803]  Notice all these new internet shows, they have the same microphone and everything.
[01:24:31.803 --> 01:24:33.424]  Which is good, it's going to be a trailblazer.
[01:24:33.424 --> 01:24:37.426]  I'm going to take 20 of your phone calls before this hour ends and I'm going to get really, really upset.
[01:24:38.126 --> 01:24:39.967]  But as I said, we do have a guest coming up.
[01:24:39.967 --> 01:24:42.888]  Okay, let's go ahead and talk to Colt in Kansas.
[01:24:42.888 --> 01:24:43.888]  Colt, you're on the air.
[01:24:43.888 --> 01:24:47.270]  Sorry about the dramatic stuff.
[01:24:47.270 --> 01:24:50.331]  Hi, this is, uh, am I on?
[01:24:50.331 --> 01:24:50.871]  Absolutely.
[01:24:50.871 --> 01:24:53.933]  Colt, how is it in Kansas right now?
[01:24:53.933 --> 01:24:55.413]  Uh, it's actually pretty nice.
[01:24:55.413 --> 01:25:02.676]  It's normally 40 degrees and below and wind blowing, but today it's actually 60 degrees and pretty nice.
[01:25:02.676 --> 01:25:04.117]  Sounds like a lovely day.
[01:25:05.216 --> 01:25:07.958]  So I got a couple things I want to talk about.
[01:25:07.958 --> 01:25:14.342]  Number one, I want to give a little bit of background so you know where I'm coming from.
[01:25:14.342 --> 01:25:19.205]  I'm from, actually, Clearwater, Kansas, and I grew up on a ranch and stuff.
[01:25:19.205 --> 01:25:24.089]  We bale our own hay and stuff, and cleaned stalls all the way through my childhood.
[01:25:24.089 --> 01:25:25.990]  You can sked a buck, you can run a trot line.
[01:25:25.990 --> 01:25:27.291]  That's right.
[01:25:30.382 --> 01:25:37.208]  As I've got older now, when I bale hay every year, my sinuses just go nuts after the second and third day.
[01:25:37.208 --> 01:25:45.615]  Well, I heard about your caveman, and so I started trying it, and actually, I haven't got sick at all, and I've been taking it for eight months now.
[01:25:45.615 --> 01:25:46.756]  Wow.
[01:25:46.756 --> 01:25:55.944]  And, I mean, just like cold sick, you know, usually sinuses and stuff, between changing seasons, you know, your sinuses flare up.
[01:25:56.742 --> 01:25:59.605]  Since I've been taking Caveman, I haven't had any problem.
[01:25:59.605 --> 01:26:01.366]  I haven't got sick one time.
[01:26:01.366 --> 01:26:02.227]  I couldn't believe it.
[01:26:02.227 --> 01:26:10.294]  You know, it's funny you say that, because I, from time to time, go read the reviews, and people talked about reduced allergies, and look, here's the deal.
[01:26:10.294 --> 01:26:11.796]  They give you a bowl of chicken soup,
[01:26:13.177 --> 01:26:15.438]  And everybody knows it's been associated with getting well quicker.
[01:26:15.438 --> 01:26:18.300]  This is hundreds of times stronger per serving.
[01:26:18.300 --> 01:26:28.045]  It's concentrated organic chicken bone with chaga mushroom, bee pollen, and a bunch of stuff that is actually known to be anti-inflammatory.
[01:26:28.045 --> 01:26:30.126]  But we put it there because it's an antioxidant.
[01:26:30.126 --> 01:26:32.868]  And so, I mean, it really is an insane formula.
[01:26:32.868 --> 01:26:42.313]  And for bodybuilders, for people that are working out, I just, I saw three or four years ago that the biggest, hottest thing in bodybuilding and in the Olympic athletes and NFL players
[01:26:43.524 --> 01:26:49.031]  But also folks who wanted to detoxify and for weight loss as well, depending on how you want to use it, would be bone broth.
[01:26:49.031 --> 01:26:52.376]  Boiling down chicken bones, boiling down beef bones.
[01:26:52.376 --> 01:26:53.377]  But beef can have some issues.
[01:26:53.377 --> 01:26:54.018]  We went with chicken.
[01:26:55.183 --> 01:27:08.049]  And that for your bones, your cartilage, your energy, if you remember to just take a scoop of it with your milk or mix it with whey like I do so it tastes good, it's crazy how good these products are.
[01:27:08.049 --> 01:27:11.771]  So I didn't mean to go into a whole other plug about it, but yeah, Capeman's been sold out.
[01:27:11.771 --> 01:27:13.072]  It's funny I just mentioned it's been sold out.
[01:27:13.072 --> 01:27:14.332]  It's now back in stock.
[01:27:14.332 --> 01:27:22.936]  If people just try this ultimate bone broth formula, they will see for themselves what it does within a week or so.
[01:27:22.936 --> 01:27:24.077]  So thank you for the plug, my friend.
[01:27:25.186 --> 01:27:27.747]  It is, yeah, it's amazing, I love it.
[01:27:27.747 --> 01:27:28.127]  Thank you.
[01:27:28.127 --> 01:27:36.311]  So anyways, is there, do you have in the works anything like a kid's cave for like my daughter, you know, she's growing, she's five years old.
[01:27:36.311 --> 01:27:44.214]  I'd like for her to get, you know, a lot of those nutrients and she gets sick at least once a month, gets a cold or, you know, sciences flare up.
[01:27:44.214 --> 01:27:48.516]  Well, I was about to say, I mean, I give Caveman because my daughters and my son love
[01:27:50.017 --> 01:27:50.277]  You know,
[01:28:10.003 --> 01:28:13.664]  I mean, just a little bit of syrup from agave or whatever.
[01:28:13.664 --> 01:28:15.705]  And then they slurp it all down and they love it.
[01:28:15.705 --> 01:28:18.105]  And it's funny you say that, because kids go to school.
[01:28:18.105 --> 01:28:20.606]  My kids used to get sick maybe three or four times a year.
[01:28:20.606 --> 01:28:21.806]  I cross my fingers.
[01:28:21.806 --> 01:28:23.127]  It's been crazy.
[01:28:23.127 --> 01:28:26.228]  They haven't had fevers or stuff or really been sick in like a year.
[01:28:26.228 --> 01:28:27.448]  And it's funny you say that.
[01:28:27.448 --> 01:28:29.569]  So Caveman is totally safe.
[01:28:29.569 --> 01:28:31.589]  It's not like a drug or a supplement.
[01:28:31.589 --> 01:28:35.670]  It's just bone broth, chaga mushroom, and bee pollen and stuff.
[01:28:35.670 --> 01:28:36.491]  So it's good for children.
[01:28:36.491 --> 01:28:37.511]  Just a smaller dose.
[01:28:37.511 --> 01:28:37.911]  Thank you, Cole.
[01:28:39.582 --> 01:28:42.686]  What looks good under your Christmas tree and tastes even better?

[01:32:59.502 --> 01:33:02.165]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:33:02.165 --> 01:33:12.014]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[01:33:12.014 --> 01:33:13.315]  With that, we will call the vote.
[01:33:13.315 --> 01:33:14.176]  Commissioner Clyburn?
[01:33:14.176 --> 01:33:14.716]  I dissent.
[01:33:14.716 --> 01:33:16.338]  Commissioner O'Reilly?
[01:33:16.338 --> 01:33:16.758]  Aye.
[01:33:16.758 --> 01:33:17.779]  Commissioner Carr?
[01:33:17.779 --> 01:33:18.159]  Aye.
[01:33:18.159 --> 01:33:19.861]  Commissioner Rosenworcel?
[01:33:19.861 --> 01:33:20.402]  I dissent.
[01:33:21.291 --> 01:33:22.092]  The chair votes aye.
[01:33:22.092 --> 01:33:25.194]  The item is adopted with editorial privileges granted as requested.
[01:33:25.194 --> 01:33:28.316]  Thanks to the staff for your terrific work on this item.
[01:33:28.316 --> 01:33:35.181]  Madam Secretary, could you please announce the next item on today's agenda?
[01:33:35.181 --> 01:33:41.646]  So they voted 3-2 along partisan lines at the FCC to repeal net neutrality.
[01:33:41.646 --> 01:33:50.432]  Now, Obama called the last package of regulations and legislation net neutrality.
[01:33:51.707 --> 01:34:12.822]  It'd be like if I named a bill Eternal Life, and the bill actually said that at age 30 everybody had to be killed, like Logan's Run, and then if somebody repealed that everybody had to be killed at age 30, they would say, well, they've repealed Eternal Life.
[01:34:12.822 --> 01:34:16.645]  You're like, no, actually, this kills everybody at age 30.
[01:34:16.645 --> 01:34:18.026]  But it's called Eternal Life.
[01:34:20.162 --> 01:34:21.983]  It's like in Spinal Tap.
[01:34:21.983 --> 01:34:25.664]  He goes, and this amplifier goes up to 11.
[01:34:25.664 --> 01:34:27.845]  And they go, but why don't you just have it just be louder and go to 10?
[01:34:27.845 --> 01:34:28.806]  He goes, but it's 11.
[01:34:28.806 --> 01:34:40.271]  Yeah, send you up to Logan's Run Carousel at age 30 and vaporize you under eugenics law.
[01:34:40.271 --> 01:34:44.012]  Carousel, carousel, all run by Technotronic Technocracy.
[01:34:44.012 --> 01:34:46.894]  I don't think I've heard of this again lately.
[01:34:46.894 --> 01:34:49.155]  Anyways, I'm digressing.
[01:34:49.155 --> 01:34:49.355]  So,
[01:34:51.072 --> 01:34:53.833]  That's what they do.
[01:34:53.833 --> 01:34:55.613]  And they think we're idiots.
[01:34:55.613 --> 01:35:05.895]  Now, does that mean what the Republicans are bringing in, or what's being proposed to replace it, is any better?
[01:35:05.895 --> 01:35:15.677]  Well, it's not open, naked censorship by Google, Facebook, and Twitter, who under the old rules, and under the new ones that Obama put in, can censor, do whatever, and run real
[01:35:17.210 --> 01:35:19.152]  Blocking, real control.
[01:35:19.152 --> 01:35:28.479]  Not just slowing down your content, blocking your content, or redirecting your content, or putting you into a place where nobody can see you, or putting messages up saying, sure you want to go here.
[01:35:28.479 --> 01:35:33.523]  I mean, that's the opposite of net neutrality, sweetheart.
[01:35:33.523 --> 01:35:39.108]  That's the opposite of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 15 years ago, and stuff that made sense.
[01:35:41.198 --> 01:35:42.298]  No.
[01:35:42.298 --> 01:35:44.979]  I've been running an internet operation for 20-something years.
[01:35:44.979 --> 01:35:45.879]  I got the tech people.
[01:35:45.879 --> 01:35:46.940]  I read the news.
[01:35:46.940 --> 01:35:48.540]  I know what this is.
[01:35:48.540 --> 01:35:50.521]  And I've experienced the censorship.
[01:35:50.521 --> 01:35:54.822]  And I've got the congressional hearings admitting they're censoring.
[01:35:54.822 --> 01:35:58.843]  But I've got beyond the congressional hearings.
[01:35:58.843 --> 01:36:00.444]  I've experienced it.
[01:36:00.444 --> 01:36:02.144]  And I've witnessed it.
[01:36:02.144 --> 01:36:05.025]  And I've watched it.
[01:36:05.025 --> 01:36:08.406]  And now I sit there and watch them play on everyone.
[01:36:09.451 --> 01:36:12.533]  Like, Trump's Hitler, Trump's going to implode the economy.
[01:36:12.533 --> 01:36:13.553]  The opposite happens.
[01:36:13.553 --> 01:36:17.315]  Or, oh, the FCC repeals net neutrality.
[01:36:17.315 --> 01:36:23.698]  Now, most of the headlines are, net neutrality is over.
[01:36:23.698 --> 01:36:26.780]  You know, that's what the Associated Press and people are saying.
[01:36:26.780 --> 01:36:29.722]  The Verge says the FCC just killed net neutrality.
[01:36:29.722 --> 01:36:33.704]  No, they just killed legislation and laws that were called net neutrality.
[01:36:34.500 --> 01:36:39.884]  See, the globalists play semantical games, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:36:39.884 --> 01:36:43.327]  And I wonder how the public is so stupid.
[01:36:43.327 --> 01:36:49.913]  Because RT actually got it right when they said FCC repeals net neutrality.
[01:36:49.913 --> 01:36:53.956]  And what did RT, the evil Russians, do?
[01:36:53.956 --> 01:36:54.777]  They put it in quotes.
[01:36:56.738 --> 01:37:01.581]  Because that's what they're calling the legislation is net neutrality.
[01:37:01.581 --> 01:37:02.682]  The law, it was not.
[01:37:02.682 --> 01:37:04.022]  It's what Obama did.
[01:37:04.022 --> 01:37:06.204]  And have you enjoyed the record censorship?
[01:37:06.204 --> 01:37:10.927]  Have you enjoyed the record low speeds for libertarian and patriot sides are not even being able to get to them?
[01:37:10.927 --> 01:37:17.210]  Have you enjoyed all the internet and ISP companies kicking conservatives and libertarians off their domain registrar?
[01:37:17.210 --> 01:37:21.433]  I mean, baby, that's not having an open free internet.
[01:37:21.433 --> 01:37:23.034]  That's killing net neutrality.
[01:37:25.717 --> 01:37:34.164]  But the big telecoms, Time Warner and AT&T, they're villains as well.
[01:37:34.164 --> 01:37:39.188]  They've just been getting shafted the last eight, nine years by Google and Facebook and Twitter.
[01:37:39.188 --> 01:37:43.491]  So they're going, oh, we need to replace it with something now.
[01:37:43.491 --> 01:37:45.493]  And then a lot of that has bad stuff in it.
[01:37:45.493 --> 01:37:47.575]  And a lot of that is just classic.
[01:37:47.575 --> 01:37:51.098]  We're going to charge you more when you go over our network or charge you more to have better connections.
[01:37:52.967 --> 01:37:57.330]  All the rest of it, and kind of give you a forced list of things you're going to look at on the front page.
[01:37:57.330 --> 01:37:59.111]  That's already going on.
[01:37:59.111 --> 01:38:00.471]  And we're against that!
[01:38:00.471 --> 01:38:07.075]  But they play this game, like Trump said about taxes, he goes, I'd like to call it tax reform, because that could go up, that could go down.
[01:38:07.075 --> 01:38:10.958]  You get run over by a bus, as I've always said.
[01:38:10.958 --> 01:38:11.798]  You're reformed!
[01:38:11.798 --> 01:38:14.580]  I mean, it breaks every bone in your body.
[01:38:14.580 --> 01:38:19.783]  It's going 60 miles an hour, it hits you, you're dead, you're for 100 yards down the road, splattered.
[01:38:20.879 --> 01:38:23.880]  There's a heart, there's a spleen, there's a leg, there's a head.
[01:38:23.880 --> 01:38:24.940]  Every bone in your body is broken.
[01:38:24.940 --> 01:38:26.100]  You are reformed.
[01:38:26.100 --> 01:38:28.961]  Is that necessarily a good thing?
[01:38:28.961 --> 01:38:31.542]  When cancer takes over your body, it reforms your cells.
[01:38:31.542 --> 01:38:32.142]  Is it a good thing?
[01:38:32.142 --> 01:38:33.202]  No.
[01:38:33.202 --> 01:38:34.883]  It's tax cuts.
[01:38:34.883 --> 01:38:36.903]  Tax cuts.
[01:38:36.903 --> 01:38:37.543]  Same thing here.
[01:38:37.543 --> 01:38:39.984]  They play games.
[01:38:39.984 --> 01:38:42.244]  The telecoms are proposing a lot of bad stuff.
[01:38:42.244 --> 01:38:43.525]  Of course, they're big globalists.
[01:38:43.525 --> 01:38:44.345]  They're pigs.
[01:38:44.345 --> 01:38:45.925]  They want to consolidate control.
[01:38:45.925 --> 01:38:48.306]  You think Time Warner and AT&T are conservative?
[01:38:49.548 --> 01:38:55.032]  They just haven't been winning like Facebook, Twitter, and Google.
[01:38:55.032 --> 01:39:00.296]  They've been kind of pushed aside because they were kind of old telecoms and weren't as sophisticated.
[01:39:00.296 --> 01:39:02.118]  They didn't see what was happening with the net companies.
[01:39:04.500 --> 01:39:08.381]  So they go out and tell the left, oh, Ajay Pai is going to take the internet away from you.
[01:39:08.381 --> 01:39:18.005]  While the left is cheering to ban everybody off Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube, and the big companies are doing it, or slowing you down, or blocking you, and the left's like, censor them!
[01:39:18.005 --> 01:39:19.325]  Shut them off!
[01:39:19.325 --> 01:39:21.066]  Ajay Pai wants to censor!
[01:39:21.066 --> 01:39:23.467]  Get him!
[01:39:23.467 --> 01:39:31.350]  Under the earlier version of the net neutrality bill, the UN would have had full control, and Soros is in the WikiLeaks saying,
[01:39:32.619 --> 01:39:36.923]  That we're going to take full control and block conservative or nationalist news and only have our news.
[01:39:36.923 --> 01:39:41.768]  There's quotes by him, him, saying we're going to control everything in the West.
[01:39:41.768 --> 01:39:43.329]  We're going to control what you read.
[01:39:43.329 --> 01:39:44.571]  That's censorship.
[01:39:44.571 --> 01:39:46.012]  That's authoritarianism.
[01:39:46.012 --> 01:39:46.813]  That's evil.
[01:39:46.813 --> 01:39:47.593]  That's wrong.
[01:39:47.593 --> 01:39:48.414]  That's bad.
[01:39:48.414 --> 01:39:49.836]  That's what you've done!
[01:39:52.526 --> 01:39:55.269]  So Ajay Pai comes in and goes, we're just going back to the way it was.
[01:39:55.269 --> 01:39:56.650]  Now it's got to be renegotiated.
[01:39:56.650 --> 01:39:57.852]  Stop saying I'm doing this.
[01:39:57.852 --> 01:40:03.698]  And I read his quotes and what he's saying, and it's exactly what I'm saying and what I researched before we ever said it, because it's true!
[01:40:03.698 --> 01:40:08.182]  The guy is good!
[01:40:08.182 --> 01:40:15.090]  Soros, Ford Foundation, Shovel, 196 million in net neutrality groups, staffed to the White House.
[01:40:15.090 --> 01:40:15.210]  Yep.
[01:40:16.348 --> 01:40:20.029]  Death threats, all of it, to say net neutrality is over.
[01:40:20.029 --> 01:40:25.991]  Well watch, you're going to be able to go to Infowars.com, unless you're on Facebook, Twitter, or Google and they're blocking us.
[01:40:25.991 --> 01:40:29.933]  Remember Soros said last week, it's racist, yes, it's racist.
[01:40:29.933 --> 01:40:32.593]  A guy that bankrupts countries, third world countries, takes control.
[01:40:32.593 --> 01:40:39.956]  So remember Ajay Pai, he came out last week, here's some of the quotes, FCC chairman calls Silicon Valley a bunch of hypocrites on net neutrality.
[01:40:41.371 --> 01:40:50.276]  He points out that Tim Cook of Apple, the head of Apple, was in China last week working with the government for their vision to be brought into Apple.
[01:40:50.276 --> 01:40:52.157]  This is quotes from them.
[01:40:52.157 --> 01:40:58.061]  You're with the communist Chinese that kidnap Buddhists for no reason and sell their organs.
[01:40:58.061 --> 01:41:02.704]  I mean, you know, we're talking ghoul level.
[01:41:02.704 --> 01:41:04.985]  FCC chairman calls Silicon Valley a bunch of hypocrites.
[01:41:07.338 --> 01:41:22.114]  If these companies are truly committed to an open internet where Americans can freely access the content of their choice, like I am, it's curious that they focus on unnecessary and harmful regulation of other parts of the internet ecosystem with little history of engaging in this kind of behavior, Pye writes.
[01:41:22.114 --> 01:41:23.355]  He calls out Twitter for dis...
[01:41:24.216 --> 01:41:30.419]  Allowing pro-life messages, they banned it, by GOP representative Marsha Blackburn's campaign video.
[01:41:30.419 --> 01:41:38.103]  In the end, Blackburn states, I fought Planned Parenthood and we stopped the sale of baby body parts, which Twitter immediately flagged as inflammatory.
[01:41:38.103 --> 01:41:40.684]  Twitter eventually relented and let the ad run.
[01:41:40.984 --> 01:41:43.825]  Of course, after it had 3 million views, they killed the viral spread.
[01:41:43.825 --> 01:41:51.549]  Pi also scolds YouTube for removing videos from African-American Trump supporters, Diamond and Silk, and a video posted by far-right commentator Dennis Prager.
[01:41:51.549 --> 01:41:52.229]  Far-right?
[01:41:52.229 --> 01:41:53.270]  That's super.
[01:41:53.270 --> 01:41:56.331]  Just on target and very milk dust.
[01:41:56.331 --> 01:41:57.412]  I want Prager on.
[01:41:57.412 --> 01:42:01.734]  The latter features Alan Dershowitz's lecture titled, Israel's Legal Founding.
[01:42:02.802 --> 01:42:06.885]  Prager sued YouTube, yeah, because they won't even let him speak at universities.
[01:42:06.885 --> 01:42:09.086]  Alan Dershowitz, they won't let him speak anywhere, basically.
[01:42:09.086 --> 01:42:10.887]  So now they won't even let him be online.
[01:42:10.887 --> 01:42:17.111]  And Alan Dershowitz can't even, a Harvard Law scholar, can't even talk on Twitter or Facebook.
[01:42:17.111 --> 01:42:19.653]  And you're telling me, oh, they're going to censor us!
[01:42:19.653 --> 01:42:22.395]  And he's got them praising Communist China right here!
[01:42:26.235 --> 01:42:30.424]  We're gonna come right back and take your phone calls.
[01:42:30.424 --> 01:42:31.627]  But give me a break!
[01:42:31.627 --> 01:42:34.794]  He just restored net neutrality, jackass liars!
[01:42:38.962 --> 01:42:46.448]  I am very proud to announce the introduction of the highest quality InfoWars Biome Defense Probiotic.
[01:42:46.448 --> 01:42:59.659]  We wanted to come out with the largest spectrum of high quality known probiotics that have been proven to improve overall digestion and health and detoxification in the body.

[01:43:12.483 --> 01:43:18.445]  Our researchers are confident that we have been able to develop what will be the leading probiotic on the market.

[01:43:40.330 --> 01:43:43.291]  You heard it here first, and the globalists are already dreading it.
[01:43:44.198 --> 01:43:49.879]  It's the first annual Christmas Spectacular Extravaganza brought to you by InfoWars.
[01:43:49.879 --> 01:43:53.160]  And it's launching Christmas week, leading into Christmas.
[01:43:53.160 --> 01:43:55.700]  You know, Christmas is about Christmas.
[01:43:55.700 --> 01:44:02.242]  And to celebrate this, we've got the biggest sales in the history of InfoWars at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:44:02.242 --> 01:44:06.643]  50 to 67% off all our best-selling items and free shipping.
[01:44:06.643 --> 01:44:12.804]  A lot of these items, high-quality supplements, nutraceuticals, Patriot Apparel, water filtration, you name it.
[01:44:13.684 --> 01:44:23.572]  Is lost leader prices right now because I want to celebrate the birth of Jesus Christ and celebrate Western culture and celebrate the resurgence of freedom.
[01:44:23.572 --> 01:44:31.978]  So find out about the mega sales and special broadcasts going on this week only at InfoWars.com forward slash show and InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:44:31.978 --> 01:44:37.302]  Again, it is the Christmas spectacular extravaganza!
[01:44:39.850 --> 01:44:40.671]  I'm so excited.
[01:44:40.671 --> 01:44:50.817]  The new product at Infowarslife.com, in a glass bottle, two-month servings, filled to the brim, filled to the absolute top, the real Red Pill.
[01:44:50.817 --> 01:44:56.321]  This is a heart and brain pill, a nootropic, but doesn't have any stimulants in it.
[01:44:56.321 --> 01:44:59.323]  But boy, does it stimulate, because it's beyond that.
[01:44:59.323 --> 01:45:08.129]  Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients, but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200.
[01:45:10.190 --> 01:45:29.805]  For the formulae, and I came up with our own formula, working with some scientists and developers, non-GMO, made right here in America, 120 capsules, and ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglanone to it, which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the hormones in your glands.
[01:45:29.805 --> 01:45:32.487]  It is amazing!
[01:45:32.487 --> 01:45:37.451]  Red Pill, now available at InfoWarsStore.com, and your purchase fugs the operation.
[01:45:40.558 --> 01:45:43.160]  Matt in Ohio, you're on the air, another Matt, go ahead.
[01:45:43.160 --> 01:45:57.714]  Yeah, hey listen, I just wanted to say real quick, I'm a long time listener of InfoWars, and I just wanted to say that the t-shirts that you guys are offering are absolutely fantastic, and that really is a great way to deal with this battle in the InfoWars.
[01:45:57.714 --> 01:46:05.281]  It might seem like a simple thing, but particularly these slogan t-shirts that you guys got up right now are absolutely amazing.
[01:46:05.401 --> 01:46:05.861]  Well, thank you.
[01:46:05.861 --> 01:46:10.782]  My favorite new one is the Don't Tread On Me, but instead it says Won't Tread On Me.
[01:46:10.782 --> 01:46:13.743]  And it's a big Dayglo snake, Gadsden snake.
[01:46:13.743 --> 01:46:17.004]  And then it's got the American flag, Infowars.com on the right arm.
[01:46:17.004 --> 01:46:23.165]  I mean, that's a great way just to meet like-minded people and spread the word and also exercise free speech.
[01:46:23.165 --> 01:46:25.686]  And the newest one is Trigger Warning T-shirt.
[01:46:26.426 --> 01:46:33.275]  Trigger warning t-shirt, which is the symbol of a trigger with a yield sign and then InfoWars.com on the back.
[01:46:33.275 --> 01:46:41.265]  That is the new shirt of the month available exclusively at InfoWars.com.
[01:46:41.265 --> 01:46:43.888]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:21.624 --> 01:47:31.047]  Ladies and gentlemen, in a huge victory for the people of the world against the UN, against Obama, against George Soros, against Google, against Twitter, against Facebook,
[01:47:32.225 --> 01:47:42.848]  So-called net neutrality was repealed just about 20 minutes ago by the FCC, led by Azi Pai, who's doing a great job, in a vote 3-2.
[01:47:42.848 --> 01:47:44.328]  It's huge.
[01:47:44.328 --> 01:47:45.728]  Now, I want to be clear.
[01:47:45.728 --> 01:47:55.731]  I've talked to top lawyers, telecom experts on all sides, in their offices in Seattle, D.C., meetings in Austin, Texas, because I've said I've got to sue people, so we're being censored.
[01:47:55.731 --> 01:47:57.151]  Project Veritas caught it on video.
[01:47:59.088 --> 01:48:01.392]  They have congressional hearings admitting it.
[01:48:01.392 --> 01:48:03.576]  So I've got to do it and they keep explaining.
[01:48:03.576 --> 01:48:07.603]  In the net neutrality legislation Obama signed, it's not net neutrality.
[01:48:07.603 --> 01:48:11.230]  Here's the section where it says they can censor you and they're given liability protection.
[01:48:12.452 --> 01:48:14.813]  That's what they're repealing now.
[01:48:14.813 --> 01:48:17.294]  Now there's got to be new bills when they're going to battle.
[01:48:17.294 --> 01:48:21.876]  It doesn't mean that AT&T isn't trying to play some hanky-panky or Time Warner.
[01:48:21.876 --> 01:48:24.697]  They're fighting with Google, Facebook, and Twitter over control.
[01:48:24.697 --> 01:48:34.080]  We now can have a real battle over net neutrality instead of Obama and the UN calling it net neutrality and trying to give full control to the UN.
[01:48:34.080 --> 01:48:35.101]  He didn't get full control.
[01:48:36.544 --> 01:48:38.285]  But they got partial.
[01:48:38.285 --> 01:48:39.965]  Now that's being repealed.
[01:48:39.965 --> 01:48:44.406]  So, it doesn't mean I'm siding with AT&T or Time Warner.
[01:48:44.406 --> 01:48:46.067]  I don't care about any of us.
[01:48:46.067 --> 01:48:47.768]  They want their own control of the web.
[01:48:47.768 --> 01:48:50.308]  There's a fight over the future of the web.
[01:48:50.308 --> 01:48:53.749]  But they said this was making it a utility.
[01:48:53.749 --> 01:48:54.330]  Okay?
[01:48:54.330 --> 01:48:58.311]  And that they couldn't charge little guys more than big guys or vice versa.
[01:48:58.311 --> 01:48:58.571]  Folks.
[01:49:00.737 --> 01:49:04.120]  They put censorship in here, control, monopolies.
[01:49:04.120 --> 01:49:09.064]  All you've seen since this got in law a year ago is all hell break loose and censorship.
[01:49:09.064 --> 01:49:10.906]  Look around you!
[01:49:10.906 --> 01:49:13.288]  So this is bad.
[01:49:13.288 --> 01:49:14.329]  We just had a victory.
[01:49:15.100 --> 01:49:16.961]  Does it mean all the regulations are good?
[01:49:16.961 --> 01:49:17.981]  Absolutely not!
[01:49:17.981 --> 01:49:22.102]  Does it not mean that the big telecoms want to be big monopoly boys like Google?
[01:49:22.102 --> 01:49:24.803]  They're just not as new or sophisticated.
[01:49:24.803 --> 01:49:26.604]  They want to learn how to.
[01:49:26.604 --> 01:49:28.544]  They're bad too.
[01:49:28.544 --> 01:49:41.288]  But the misrepresentation that this is Ajay Pai moving the ball backwards, he just brought it back to where it was before Obama did this.
[01:49:41.288 --> 01:49:43.009]  So this is a big deal.
[01:49:43.882 --> 01:49:46.503]  I've been in the lawyers' offices, and you've heard the guest on.
[01:49:46.503 --> 01:49:57.249]  They bring up the subsection that the FCC is now going back on, and it just says right there, I mean, this new FCC thing, under Obama, before he left office, they're just not implementing it.
[01:49:57.249 --> 01:49:58.310]  Trump just didn't implement it.
[01:49:58.310 --> 01:50:02.152]  He said the FCC's over the internet, it's over all transmissions, it can censor people.
[01:50:03.137 --> 01:50:09.600]  They had other members of the FCC say, censor Alex Jones, he's a Russian agent, take him off the air.
[01:50:09.600 --> 01:50:10.361]  Type that in.
[01:50:10.361 --> 01:50:16.264]  Outgoing head Democrat on FCC says Alex Jones needs to be criminally investigated.
[01:50:16.264 --> 01:50:20.846]  I mean, you'll get mainstream news to talk about a lunatic.
[01:50:20.846 --> 01:50:27.069]  The head Democrat just says I'm a Russian and just says shut me up.
[01:50:30.011 --> 01:50:35.074]  But see, they passed it, and then Trump came in, and Trump ignored it.
[01:50:35.074 --> 01:50:38.637]  And now Algie Pai is a hero, and under death threats, just did the right thing.
[01:50:38.637 --> 01:50:42.279]  So we're back to where we were.
[01:50:42.279 --> 01:50:44.481]  They've taken us down a rat hole, we're back up on the surface.
[01:50:44.481 --> 01:50:45.081]  There it is.
[01:50:45.081 --> 01:50:49.204]  Alex Jones says he's under criminal espionage investigation for alleged Russian ties.
[01:50:49.204 --> 01:50:50.304]  That's the Washington Times.
[01:50:50.304 --> 01:50:51.925]  Scroll down, it's got a link to McClatchy in it.
[01:50:51.925 --> 01:50:55.588]  Because, again, they don't ever want you to know I'm even under attack.
[01:50:55.588 --> 01:50:56.589]  They just want to make jokes about it.
[01:50:56.589 --> 01:50:56.829]  There it is.
[01:50:58.137 --> 01:51:01.958]  Yeah, click on the, it'll have a link for McClatchy in there.
[01:51:01.958 --> 01:51:04.358]  One of those links.
[01:51:04.358 --> 01:51:05.038]  Yeah, there it is.
[01:51:05.038 --> 01:51:06.458]  FCC meeting this week in Washington.
[01:51:06.458 --> 01:51:07.819]  That was the Federal Election Commission.
[01:51:07.819 --> 01:51:09.819]  There was also somebody on the FCC Senate.
[01:51:09.819 --> 01:51:12.340]  Go ahead and click where it says meeting in Washington.
[01:51:12.340 --> 01:51:14.800]  So, that's what they're doing!
[01:51:14.800 --> 01:51:15.840]  That's what they're up to!
[01:51:15.840 --> 01:51:18.861]  That's the garbage they're involved in!
[01:51:18.861 --> 01:51:21.141]  And, it's sick!
[01:51:21.141 --> 01:51:24.102]  It's sick!
[01:51:24.102 --> 01:51:25.342]  I'm sick of it myself!
[01:51:25.342 --> 01:51:26.162]  Alright, let's go to your calls.
[01:51:28.385 --> 01:51:29.966]  Frank in North Carolina.
[01:51:29.966 --> 01:51:32.848]  Thank you for holding, Frank.
[01:51:32.848 --> 01:51:34.929]  Yeah, Alex, that is pretty funny.
[01:51:34.929 --> 01:51:37.531]  It's pretty sick, Alex Jones, Russian agent.
[01:51:37.531 --> 01:51:42.053]  But I had a bumper music suggestion.
[01:51:42.053 --> 01:51:45.295]  Don Henley, I think it's called Inside Job or something like that.
[01:51:45.295 --> 01:51:50.338]  We actually use that as, we have that as bumper music.
[01:51:50.338 --> 01:51:52.460]  Let's come back on the next segment.
[01:51:52.460 --> 01:51:54.361]  It's an Inside Job, like it always is.
[01:51:55.342 --> 01:51:55.782]  Okay, great.
[01:51:55.782 --> 01:51:57.903]  You got the good, bad, and ugly.
[01:51:57.903 --> 01:51:59.845]  Let me go in reverse here.
[01:51:59.845 --> 01:52:00.745]  You got the ugly.
[01:52:00.745 --> 01:52:03.227]  You got the whitegenocideproject.com.
[01:52:03.227 --> 01:52:04.527]  That's pretty ugly.
[01:52:04.527 --> 01:52:05.988]  You got the bad.
[01:52:05.988 --> 01:52:12.452]  The FBI, you know, intimately involved in the 9-11 attacks and the cover-up.
[01:52:12.452 --> 01:52:16.194]  Mueller, Silverstein, I mean, excuse me, Rubenstein.
[01:52:17.893 --> 01:52:18.914]  These guys are all dirty.
[01:52:18.914 --> 01:52:21.095]  This agency is dirty inside and out.
[01:52:21.095 --> 01:52:31.479]  I don't have any confidence that anybody's going to be put in charge of that organization, that agency, that's worth a damn, that is a true American patriot.
[01:52:31.479 --> 01:52:40.963]  And lastly, I was wondering if you might consider having Dr. Duke back on, maybe before the end of the year, and kind of get his take on all the new developments in the world today.
[01:52:40.963 --> 01:52:42.564]  You're talking about David Duke?
[01:52:44.602 --> 01:52:52.010]  You know, I tried to have David Duke on to have a real discussion about not having racism from any angle and it just...
[01:52:53.030 --> 01:52:54.891]  Made people on all sides hate me.
[01:52:54.891 --> 01:52:55.752]  His people hate me.
[01:52:55.752 --> 01:52:57.293]  People that hate him hate me.
[01:52:57.293 --> 01:52:58.414]  And it just turned into a train wreck.
[01:52:58.414 --> 01:53:07.280]  But I think it'd be an interesting interview if he didn't just go off talking points and would never respond to what I was saying instead of claiming that I work for Israel or I have some connection to Israel.
[01:53:07.280 --> 01:53:08.681]  It's just, it's a script.
[01:53:08.681 --> 01:53:10.022]  I've heard it before and it's not true.
[01:53:10.022 --> 01:53:11.262]  It's not like I'm... Hold on.
[01:53:11.262 --> 01:53:12.503]  I appreciate your call, Frank.
[01:53:12.503 --> 01:53:18.307]  It's not like I'm running from that or scared or it's some magical power like Israel and I just freeze.
[01:53:18.307 --> 01:53:19.008]  I'm tired of it.
[01:53:20.009 --> 01:53:21.510]  Because I know who I work for.
[01:53:21.510 --> 01:53:22.210]  Me.
[01:53:22.210 --> 01:53:23.051]  The American people.
[01:53:23.051 --> 01:53:23.551]  Free market.
[01:53:23.551 --> 01:53:24.131]  Prosperity.
[01:53:24.131 --> 01:53:26.152]  I love God.
[01:53:26.152 --> 01:53:29.134]  I don't hate any group for what color they are or where they came from.
[01:53:29.134 --> 01:53:30.414]  But I'm gonna live my life.
[01:53:30.414 --> 01:53:32.215]  And I'm promoting Western civilization.
[01:53:32.215 --> 01:53:33.916]  And I'm having big effects.
[01:53:33.916 --> 01:53:36.197]  And we've all relaunched the American system.
[01:53:36.197 --> 01:53:37.798]  We've rebooted it.
[01:53:37.798 --> 01:53:38.818]  And that's what I'm doing.
[01:53:38.818 --> 01:53:40.299]  And I want everybody to be part of it.
[01:53:40.299 --> 01:53:41.300]  And to be part of prosperity.
[01:53:41.920 --> 01:53:43.340]  So, that's where I stand.
[01:53:43.340 --> 01:53:51.402]  Now, if other groups are racist towards me, I'll call them out and say they're racist, and I'll stand up for being, you know, my Caucasian background, and be proud of it.
[01:53:51.402 --> 01:53:54.043]  But at the same time, I just, I'm so sick of it.
[01:53:54.043 --> 01:53:57.223]  I mean, take a look at the seven and a half billion people on this planet.
[01:53:57.223 --> 01:54:00.004]  We've got to start really coming together, or we're going to kill each other.
[01:54:00.004 --> 01:54:06.746]  And I believe Renaissance free market capitalism, with our Christian ethos, is the most successful system.
[01:54:06.746 --> 01:54:08.326]  It's what I believe, it's what I'm supporting.
[01:54:09.377 --> 01:54:12.898]  What you're seeing right now is a result of Trump only having 20% of the government.
[01:54:12.898 --> 01:54:15.119]  That is crazy right there in itself.
[01:54:28.482 --> 01:54:34.845]  Him and Flynn came up with a plan when he knew that Comey came at him with that fake PPG dossier.
[01:54:34.845 --> 01:54:40.667]  They knew that the Deep State was going to try to be slick and come at them and attack.
[01:54:40.667 --> 01:54:44.209]  Flynn being, wasn't he head of the DNI?
[01:54:44.209 --> 01:54:47.510]  Yeah, all of a sudden you have a Defense Intelligence Agency.
[01:54:47.510 --> 01:54:52.512]  So, you know, he's in the counterintelligence.
[01:54:52.512 --> 01:54:55.194]  So you think that he knew all the players.
[01:54:55.194 --> 01:54:56.114]  He knew what was going on.
[01:54:56.727 --> 01:54:56.867]  Yeah.
[01:55:15.081 --> 01:55:17.683]  They basically did set up the global.
[01:55:17.683 --> 01:55:18.384]  It really is true.
[01:55:18.384 --> 01:55:20.305]  I mean, they didn't do it where they tried to do it.
[01:55:20.305 --> 01:55:21.646]  They just knew what they would do.
[01:55:21.646 --> 01:55:25.889]  And Flynn knew he was going in to directly be attacked, to expose the whole thing.
[01:55:25.889 --> 01:55:27.911]  It's funny you say that.
[01:55:27.911 --> 01:55:34.736]  And now it puts the Republicans in a situation where they have to give Trump a win on tax reform.
[01:55:34.736 --> 01:55:35.656]  They tried to fight it.
[01:55:35.656 --> 01:55:38.038]  They tried to pull it out and drag this out.
[01:55:38.038 --> 01:55:41.261]  They promised Trump would be gone in two months.
[01:55:41.261 --> 01:55:43.142]  And he's been in there almost a year.
[01:55:43.846 --> 01:55:48.548]  So, even the Republicans at the top, they have to bow down to Trump now.
[01:55:48.548 --> 01:55:55.012]  And with 20% of the government, you know, you hear these people arguing about, oh, what is he going to do about the vaccines?
[01:55:56.383 --> 01:55:58.665]  You know, you think of it, the swamp is massive.
[01:55:58.665 --> 01:56:02.647]  There's a lot of departments in the government that are corrupt.
[01:56:02.647 --> 01:56:04.169]  So it's going to take a while.
[01:56:04.169 --> 01:56:04.609]  Straight up.
[01:56:04.609 --> 01:56:06.510]  No, I totally agree with you, Chris.
[01:56:06.510 --> 01:56:10.853]  And I can't believe Trump's gotten so much done.
[01:56:10.853 --> 01:56:16.517]  And I mean, it's kind of like you make dinner for your kids and clean the whole house and then they bitch about how something tastes, you get mad.
[01:56:16.517 --> 01:56:18.399]  I mean, I can't believe he's gotten this much done.
[01:56:18.399 --> 01:56:20.220]  I mean, quite frankly, I'm in awe right now.
[01:56:21.778 --> 01:56:24.401]  Yeah, I mean, he's getting what he can done.
[01:56:24.401 --> 01:56:29.647]  You have to admire him, but he's going up against a corrupt system that's corrupt from the core.
[01:56:29.647 --> 01:56:34.032]  It's like a, you know, a busted pipe and the water's flowing out.
[01:56:34.032 --> 01:56:37.435]  That's the money that's flowing into Washington, D.C.
[01:56:37.435 --> 01:56:39.798]  He's just trying to turn that spitting just a little
[01:56:40.692 --> 01:56:41.553]  Exactly!
[01:56:41.553 --> 01:56:43.654]  That's the better analogy than the motorboat tied up at the dock.
[01:56:43.654 --> 01:56:44.614]  He's trying to untie it.
[01:56:44.614 --> 01:56:48.717]  Here's a big old busted pipe of our own tax money and our own system coming back to us.
[01:56:48.717 --> 01:56:49.277]  It's busted.
[01:56:49.277 --> 01:56:49.937]  All go on to them.
[01:56:49.937 --> 01:56:51.958]  And he's halfway fixed it.
[01:56:51.958 --> 01:56:53.279]  And we're already getting better.
[01:56:53.279 --> 01:56:56.901]  And they're trying to stop him patching the pipe.
[01:56:56.901 --> 01:56:57.301]  You know it.
[01:56:59.042 --> 01:57:00.103]  Well, that's amazing, Chris.
[01:57:00.103 --> 01:57:00.744]  Call back again.
[01:57:00.744 --> 01:57:01.664]  I always love when Chris calls.
[01:57:01.664 --> 01:57:03.186]  He gets in every once in a while.
[01:57:03.186 --> 01:57:04.166]  That's why we've got an open phone station.
[01:57:04.166 --> 01:57:05.347]  Folks like him can get in.
[01:57:05.347 --> 01:57:08.530]  Alex, Issa, Aaron, Brian, others, your calls are coming up.
[01:57:08.530 --> 01:57:12.414]  And then we've got a very, very special guest here on the transmission.
[01:57:12.414 --> 01:57:13.334]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:57:13.334 --> 01:57:14.195]  Please spread the articles.
[01:57:14.195 --> 01:57:16.817]  Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:57:16.817 --> 01:57:17.698]  Spread those videos.
[01:57:17.698 --> 01:57:18.539]  Spread those articles.
[01:57:18.539 --> 01:57:20.821]  If you don't, their censorship will win.
[01:57:20.821 --> 01:57:21.361]  We'll be back.
[01:57:21.361 --> 01:57:21.782]  Stay with us.
[01:57:31.988 --> 01:57:36.220]  Proper B vitamin intake is essential to keep the body functioning at optimum levels.
[01:57:39.178 --> 01:57:44.241]  With our modern diets, it can be hard to get the recommended amount of B vitamins we need every day.
[01:57:44.241 --> 01:57:46.182]  O-O-O-Optimum levels.
[01:57:46.182 --> 01:57:47.943]  B vitamins we need every day.
[01:57:47.943 --> 01:57:53.206]  Secret 12 combines two bioactive forms of vitamin B12 for optimal absorption.
[01:57:53.206 --> 01:57:55.507]  O-O-O-Optimal absorption.
[01:57:55.507 --> 01:58:01.170]  Being deficient in B vitamins can cause fatigue, depression, poor memory, and lethargy.
[01:58:01.170 --> 01:58:01.570]  Secret 12.
[01:58:01.570 --> 01:58:02.331]  O-O-O-Optimum levels.

[01:59:31.759 --> 01:59:34.440]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:59:45.066 --> 01:59:52.089]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[01:59:52.089 --> 01:59:58.611]  Merle Haggard, baby!
[01:59:58.611 --> 02:00:02.533]  He left his living in cheap hotels.
[02:00:02.533 --> 02:00:06.595]  The desert's quiet, Cleveland's cold.
[02:00:06.595 --> 02:00:10.476]  A lot happened in 2017.
[02:00:10.476 --> 02:00:12.237]  I'll be honest with you, it's been a hell of a year.
[02:00:13.834 --> 02:00:17.377]  But it's also been an amazing year.
[02:00:17.377 --> 02:00:22.622]  We only did what we had to do.
[02:00:22.622 --> 02:00:23.923]  And now we've grown old.
[02:00:23.923 --> 02:00:28.587]  A lot of amazing callers today.
[02:00:28.587 --> 02:00:33.110]  We're gonna go right back to your phone calls.
[02:00:33.110 --> 02:00:34.652]  Then Mark Dice, he's got his new book.
[02:00:36.462 --> 02:00:43.285]  The story of fake news, and I know you as listeners already know as much as I do or more, and I'm not patronizing.
[02:00:43.285 --> 02:00:44.626]  I'm always amazed.
[02:00:44.626 --> 02:00:45.966]  You know more than I do.
[02:00:45.966 --> 02:00:49.848]  You're savvy on most points, because you're just, I'm kind of overwhelmed here.
[02:00:49.848 --> 02:00:51.689]  You're kind of able to focus in on what you think is most important.
[02:00:51.689 --> 02:00:58.492]  A lot of times, it is more important, but friends, family, neighbors, give them the true story of fake news.
[02:00:58.492 --> 02:01:00.393]  Great cover.
[02:01:00.393 --> 02:01:01.273]  It's amazing.
[02:01:01.273 --> 02:01:05.095]  We got 500 copies here at Infowarsstore.com, and I just decided
[02:01:06.104 --> 02:01:21.487]  That I'm going to sign every copy of the first 500, or the amount of orders that come in by the 19th, the last day, that we can guarantee take an order and get it to you on or before Christmas, or the day before Christmas, technically.
[02:01:21.487 --> 02:01:29.448]  We can take orders until two days before and get it to you in like 30 states, but if you want to get it in Alaska or Hawaii or stuff like that, we need to get your orders in by really the 18th, get it out on the 19th.
[02:01:29.448 --> 02:01:32.189]  That's why they say the 18th's the cutoff, because we got to get it out by the 19th.
[02:01:32.189 --> 02:01:33.369]  So the 18th, technically.
[02:01:34.383 --> 02:01:38.147]  The true story of fake news by the one, the only Mark Dice.
[02:01:38.147 --> 02:01:45.355]  And this book, until they started censoring it and blocking it and kicking him off things and doing what they normally do, went to one of the top ratings.
[02:01:45.355 --> 02:01:49.339]  He's joining us in a moment of political books out there on Amazon.
[02:01:49.339 --> 02:01:51.041]  So that's coming up with Mark Dice.
[02:01:51.041 --> 02:01:53.124]  Right now, let's go back to your phone calls.
[02:01:54.397 --> 02:01:56.038]  Who should we talk to here?
[02:01:56.038 --> 02:01:58.319]  Going in order who's been holding the longest.
[02:01:58.319 --> 02:02:06.703]  We got Brian in Indiana, Aaron in New Mexico, Issa in Austin, Texas, and we've got Alex in Missouri.
[02:02:06.703 --> 02:02:09.485]  Let's go ahead and talk to Alex in Missouri and we'll go to the rest of you.
[02:02:09.485 --> 02:02:09.785]  Thank you.
[02:02:09.785 --> 02:02:11.646]  Go ahead.
[02:02:11.646 --> 02:02:12.526]  Oh, hey Alex.
[02:02:12.526 --> 02:02:15.287]  I've been listening to your show for about a year now.
[02:02:15.287 --> 02:02:18.869]  I'm only about 19 years old, but... Welcome!
[02:02:18.869 --> 02:02:20.590]  I'm originally from Chicago.
[02:02:20.590 --> 02:02:22.171]  I've moved to Kansas City about
[02:02:23.200 --> 02:02:46.398]  I want to say six years ago, but originally coming from Chicago, I wanted to ask you a question about really just Jewish influence on Marxism, Communism, and today's society, especially with today's society, because to me it seems most prevalent in today's society.
[02:02:47.299 --> 02:02:54.491]  Especially since, I've been reading about it a lot, especially since 1920 when the Frankfurt School was first made.
[02:02:55.365 --> 02:02:57.867]  Germany in the 20s I believe it was.
[02:03:25.325 --> 02:03:29.851]  Well, that guy with the fake name Peter Joseph, or whatever it is, that the UN and everybody pushes is the greatest thing.
[02:03:29.851 --> 02:03:36.880]  You know, we're going to all live in these big cities and communes and these compact bubble cities and the computer will tell us what to do, so we'll be free.
[02:03:36.880 --> 02:03:38.562]  But who programs the computer?
[02:03:38.562 --> 02:03:39.983]  So, a lot of this
[02:03:41.476 --> 02:03:42.277]  I don't
[02:04:00.518 --> 02:04:05.223]  Communism has been around a while, but yeah, there is a communal, hence the term communism.
[02:04:05.223 --> 02:04:08.507]  But a commune predates communism.
[02:04:08.507 --> 02:04:17.277]  It just basically takes its name, communism, or communitarian, from it and is a banker-constructed system of ultra-capitalists who are anti-free market, and that's declassified.
[02:04:17.557 --> 02:04:18.618]  Appreciate your call.
[02:04:18.618 --> 02:04:19.978]  Interesting question.
[02:04:19.978 --> 02:04:21.639]  All right, coming up straight ahead.
[02:04:21.639 --> 02:04:23.621]  Mark Dice, I'm Alex Jones.
[02:04:23.621 --> 02:04:28.824]  Newswars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, and Infowars.com.
[02:04:28.824 --> 02:04:35.468]  Spreading those links on email, by hand, you name it, is an act of rebellion against the globalists and is critical to victory.
[02:04:37.873 --> 02:04:42.276]  Fuel your body with Carnivore, the new digestive enzyme product by InfoWars Life.
[02:04:42.276 --> 02:04:50.362]  Digestive enzymes assist in the digestive process and increase the bioavailability of nutrients by breaking down foods into easily absorbable components.
[02:04:50.362 --> 02:04:55.646]  They also help prevent discomfort from indigestion caused by fermentation of undigested food particles in the gut.
[02:04:55.646 --> 02:04:58.188]  Digestive enzyme production declines as we age.
[02:04:58.188 --> 02:05:02.411]  Carnivore is filled with digestive enzymes like those naturally present in the body.
[02:05:02.411 --> 02:05:04.853]  Enjoy the full potential of protein-rich foods again.
[02:05:05.513 --> 02:05:12.756]  You can eat protein-heavy foods now, while minimizing the later indigestion and discomfort commonly associated with high-meat diets.
[02:05:12.756 --> 02:05:20.839]  Just one pill with every high-protein meal helps increase the bioavailability and absorption of amino acids, the building blocks to your muscles.
[02:05:20.839 --> 02:05:28.022]  Carnivore also contains digestive enzymes to help digest fats and carbohydrates, so you can fully digest all types of meals.
[02:05:28.022 --> 02:05:29.462]  Don't let a meal go to waste.
[02:05:29.462 --> 02:05:31.283]  Use Carnivore by InfoWars Life.
[02:05:32.103 --> 02:05:35.565]  Head to Infowarslife.com and secure your bottle now.
[02:05:35.565 --> 02:05:46.451]  That's Infowarslife.com.
[02:05:46.451 --> 02:05:50.813]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:05:50.813 --> 02:05:56.436]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[02:06:00.362 --> 02:06:21.931]  All right, we've got a lot of folks calling in right now, and we'll get to those that we're already holding, because Mark Dice is a great newshound, historian, media analyst, you know, got a degree in it, but more importantly than a degree in it in the last 20 years, he's proven one of the top media analysts out there, best-selling author, researcher, and of course, you know, famous commentary, famous videos, hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of
[02:06:23.783 --> 02:06:25.104]  Billion or something.
[02:06:25.104 --> 02:06:28.907]  But I'm really excited about this book and I never know what books are going to take off.
[02:06:28.907 --> 02:06:34.771]  But when I got an introductory copy of this a couple months ago, I read it and I said, order a bunch of those.
[02:06:34.771 --> 02:06:39.415]  But I hardly even sell books anymore because we're just so focused on the news and what we're doing.
[02:06:39.415 --> 02:06:44.799]  I used to get books that I sold for every author that came on.
[02:06:44.799 --> 02:06:48.822]  And I said, listen, we need to make this a major book we're going to push because this is perfect.
[02:06:49.793 --> 02:07:06.905]  To wake up somebody on the fence or a liberal who's been brainwashed because it's chapters that are very easy to read but very well done and all bibliographed to understand the history of it, how it happened, why it's collapsing right now, and where we're going.
[02:07:06.905 --> 02:07:10.008]  I mean, it's just really a powerful book.
[02:07:10.008 --> 02:07:10.988]  I read it in two days.
[02:07:11.969 --> 02:07:20.092]  And usually, I'm so busy now, it might take me a week or two weeks to read even a small book because I read like maybe a chapter at night, you know, at midnight and fall asleep.
[02:07:20.092 --> 02:07:22.112]  I read the whole thing on a weekend.
[02:07:22.112 --> 02:07:31.375]  Everybody needs to get The True Story of Fake News, How Mainstream Media Manipulates Millions by Mark Dice at InfowarsStore.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[02:07:31.375 --> 02:07:33.676]  It went to close to the top of the charts
[02:07:37.759 --> 02:07:42.243]  With no promotion, but then magically the censorship kicked in.
[02:07:42.243 --> 02:07:44.144]  And I want to get his take on net neutrality, too.
[02:07:44.144 --> 02:07:46.726]  Again, we didn't have net neutrality.
[02:07:46.726 --> 02:07:50.729]  Obama called his legislation taking the web over net neutrality.
[02:07:50.729 --> 02:07:52.150]  It inculcated censorship.
[02:07:52.150 --> 02:07:55.953]  It doesn't mean the other telecoms don't want something just as bad.
[02:07:55.953 --> 02:07:57.695]  There's a battle still going on.
[02:07:57.695 --> 02:07:59.416]  Obama won a big battle.
[02:07:59.416 --> 02:08:03.339]  He lost the war today, hopefully with pie, but that's not decided yet.
[02:08:03.339 --> 02:08:04.640]  So that's my take on that as well.
[02:08:05.641 --> 02:08:08.003]  It'll be your chance to talk to Mark Dice, ISA, Aaron.
[02:08:08.003 --> 02:08:10.705]  You can address your question to myself or him.
[02:08:10.705 --> 02:08:16.509]  And then others that want to get involved now, after that, specifically for Mark Dice, the number is 877-789-ALEX.
[02:08:16.509 --> 02:08:20.652]  877-789-A-L-E-X.
[02:08:20.652 --> 02:08:24.174]  We got Mark Dice here with us for the next 50 minutes or so.
[02:08:24.174 --> 02:08:25.495]  MarkDice.com.
[02:08:25.495 --> 02:08:27.056]  Want to get the book from him?
[02:08:27.056 --> 02:08:31.219]  I say don't get it at Amazon, even though it's fun to drop it at the top, just because they're such globalists.
[02:08:31.219 --> 02:08:33.401]  But regardless, we're in an info war.
[02:08:33.401 --> 02:08:34.361]  Wake people up today.
[02:08:35.553 --> 02:08:40.417]  So little books get read or handed out today that when you give somebody a book, it's really important.
[02:08:40.417 --> 02:08:46.421]  Or buy it, read it yourself, give it to the library, where on average a donated book gets read over 200 times.
[02:08:46.421 --> 02:08:48.422]  Especially with a nice cover like this.
[02:08:48.422 --> 02:08:50.084]  So, again, get the book today.
[02:08:50.084 --> 02:08:50.864]  Really excited about it.
[02:08:50.864 --> 02:08:52.425]  The True Story of Fake News.
[02:08:52.425 --> 02:08:53.206]  I got like 500 of these.
[02:08:53.206 --> 02:08:53.926]  I want to order 10,000 of these.
[02:08:57.284 --> 02:08:58.606]  I want to sell 100,000 of these.
[02:08:58.606 --> 02:09:00.608]  It'll help fund the operation, wake people up.
[02:09:00.608 --> 02:09:02.790]  Mark's a great author, great researcher.
[02:09:02.790 --> 02:09:03.631]  It's important.
[02:09:03.631 --> 02:09:13.082]  So, Mark, you go to the history, write to Modern Times, you know, you just reveal the stuff that's going on here, all the things that are happening.
[02:09:13.082 --> 02:09:17.467]  Mark Dice, what do you want to tackle first dealing with the fake news?
[02:09:18.919 --> 02:09:20.360]  Well, first of all, thanks for having me, Alex.
[02:09:20.360 --> 02:09:28.988]  I know a lot of people probably see me as sort of a comedic, sarcastic YouTuber or from my Man on the Street videos, but I do have a serious side, and the books are my serious side.
[02:09:28.988 --> 02:09:39.097]  And I was tracking what would ultimately become coined as fake news well before the election, writing a book about Operation Mockingbird, the CIA manipulation of the media.
[02:09:39.737 --> 02:09:54.961]  Then, of course, two weeks after the election, they came up with their grand unified conspiracy umbrella under which all other conspiracies could fit as to why Hillary Clinton lost, and that was the supposed fake news fiasco spreading through social media.
[02:09:54.961 --> 02:09:58.762]  Of course, they framed the issue, which is what they do, they set the agenda.
[02:09:58.762 --> 02:10:00.963]  That's one of the powers of the mainstream media.
[02:10:01.383 --> 02:10:04.805]  So that it was only, quote, fake news about Hillary Clinton.
[02:10:04.805 --> 02:10:06.366]  And that's why she lost the election.
[02:10:06.366 --> 02:10:09.827]  When, in reality, fake news was a two-way street.
[02:10:09.827 --> 02:10:12.089]  Fake news has been around for hundreds of years.
[02:10:12.089 --> 02:10:14.670]  Fake news has started wars.
[02:10:14.670 --> 02:10:21.033]  Remember the Maine incident was hyped up by William Randolph Hearst and the Pulitzer's papers.
[02:10:21.033 --> 02:10:21.593]  That's right.
[02:10:21.593 --> 02:10:25.355]  Fake news, generally, mainstream media didn't like to risk it a lot or they lost credibility.
[02:10:25.355 --> 02:10:27.196]  But they would do it to launch a war.
[02:10:27.196 --> 02:10:30.138]  The WMDs, you know, the sinking of the Maine, absolutely.
[02:10:31.277 --> 02:10:45.909]  Yeah, the real dangerous fake news doesn't come from some obscure websites or even websites that are attempting to mimic mainstream brand name websites like we saw in ABC.com.de website that was mimicking ABC.
[02:10:45.909 --> 02:10:52.675]  We saw other similar sites that were designed to sort of look like your popular brand name news channels.
[02:10:53.135 --> 02:10:58.581]  No, big internet reports, congressional reports and others admit fake news doesn't affect 1%.
[02:10:58.581 --> 02:10:59.803]  Little sites don't.
[02:10:59.803 --> 02:11:00.724]  Things, they label that.
[02:11:00.724 --> 02:11:05.710]  But as you said, the big governmental announcements and things, that absolutely has an effect.
[02:11:06.601 --> 02:11:13.108]  The most viral, quote, fake news stories during the election cycle, most of them weren't even really fake news, they were satire.
[02:11:13.108 --> 02:11:21.538]  I mean, we're talking about stories like Trump nominates Chris Christie for Supreme Food Court.
[02:11:21.538 --> 02:11:25.863]  Man yells Allahu Akbar before blowing up friend's inbox.
[02:11:26.403 --> 02:11:30.426]  I mean, it's like an Onion-style satire.
[02:11:30.426 --> 02:11:40.814]  Then they rolled this guy out named Paul Horner, who admitted to being behind some of the more viral fake news stories, which weren't even fake news to tarnish Hillary Clinton's image.
[02:11:40.814 --> 02:11:46.318]  He was writing satire pieces trying to ridicule Trump supporters, making fun of them.
[02:11:46.858 --> 02:11:51.721]  Unfortunately, some people, some Trump supporters did spread some of those stories because they only read the headline.
[02:11:51.721 --> 02:11:59.025]  One of them you're probably familiar with is that anti-Trump protesters were being paid and went to a school.
[02:11:59.025 --> 02:12:00.967]  No, I mean, there's really truth to that.
[02:12:00.967 --> 02:12:12.974]  I mean, we know that George Soros has paid tens of millions of dollars to Black Lives Matter, but this particular story... Sure, they'll create a fake story to cover up something real going on where that specific's fake to cover up a real phenomenon.
[02:12:14.259 --> 02:12:27.448]  There's always a little bit of grain of truth in there, but in Paul Horner's stories, you know, one of the kingpins of fake news, after the first paragraph, then it started to kind of go off into left field, and you could be able to tell that it was a satire story.
[02:12:27.448 --> 02:12:32.511]  But a lot of people in our, you know, instant gratification culture will share stories before even reading them.
[02:12:32.511 --> 02:12:37.795]  They'll read a headline, and they'll just think, oh, this is, I know, I've expected this to happen, let me post it, let me share it.
[02:12:38.115 --> 02:12:43.240]  But then he comes out and says, jokingly, I think I helped elect President Trump.
[02:12:43.240 --> 02:12:46.063]  And then that was a headline over all of the mainstream media.
[02:12:46.063 --> 02:12:47.464]  Sure, he's trolling them.
[02:12:47.464 --> 02:12:51.748]  But it's getting worse as Trump exposes, well, just look at last week.
[02:12:51.748 --> 02:12:54.071]  Three giant fake stories.
[02:12:54.071 --> 02:12:55.332]  I mean, obviously, you could talk about those.
[02:12:55.332 --> 02:12:55.872]  You covered them.
[02:12:55.872 --> 02:12:57.174]  I mean, which one was the biggest?
[02:12:59.144 --> 02:13:11.109]  Yeah, I would say CNN's blunder about getting the date wrong on these supposed WikiLeaks documents that the Trump campaign that they claimed had advanced knowledge of is probably the biggest blunder of this entire year.
[02:13:11.109 --> 02:13:13.570]  I'm surprised that nobody got fired for that.
[02:13:13.570 --> 02:13:25.315]  And thankfully we have a president who uses the modern-day fireside chat, which is what FDR would sit down with the American people and give them a direct radio address, because before radio,
[02:13:26.796 --> 02:13:32.259]  I mean, the only way you could actually hear a president speaking was to actually be in attendance.
[02:13:32.259 --> 02:13:33.599]  And you had to rely on the newspapers.
[02:13:33.599 --> 02:13:35.460]  And so radio started to become popular.
[02:13:35.460 --> 02:13:40.303]  This is before television, which, you know, didn't really become a household item until starting in the 50s.
[02:13:40.303 --> 02:13:44.105]  But FDR would speak directly to the people with his popular fireside chat.
[02:13:44.105 --> 02:13:48.987]  So Trump's Twitter is the modern day version of the fireside chat.
[02:13:48.987 --> 02:13:51.008]  And so never before have we had a president that's
[02:13:51.848 --> 02:13:55.310]  Willing and able to hit back against this fake news.
[02:13:55.310 --> 02:14:12.997]  And they just keep digging their grave because every time they reach and jump to conclusions or perhaps are just reading into certain material through their bizarre warped paranoid lens, they ultimately just end up looking more and more foolish.
[02:14:12.997 --> 02:14:17.679]  Just like when Anderson Cooper's Twitter account tweeted out some derogatory response to President Trump.
[02:14:17.679 --> 02:14:19.119]  Trump you're a loser, you're a scumbag.
[02:14:19.119 --> 02:14:20.320]  And he says, oh I didn't do that.
[02:14:21.837 --> 02:14:31.583]  And even if it is plausible that his assistant did it from his phone, what they're saying is that it wasn't the assistant that did it, thinking that he was logged into his personal account.
[02:14:31.583 --> 02:14:38.627]  A lot of these public figures have assistants that have access to their social media accounts, or they have staff that have access and tweet for them, obviously.
[02:14:38.627 --> 02:14:47.633]  So, it's plausible that somebody on staff tweeted, thinking that they were on their personal account, and tweeted, you know, irrespectfully on his.
[02:14:49.734 --> 02:14:51.396]  Well, they couldn't even admit that, Alex.
[02:14:51.396 --> 02:14:57.142]  They said that, well, the assistant was logged in, but then somebody at the gym stole his phone.
[02:14:57.142 --> 02:15:04.369]  Really, so... I'm sure what they want is, they want to do a stunt, then have plausible deniability, eat the cake, and, you know, and keep it, too.
[02:15:04.369 --> 02:15:05.571]  Have the cake, eat it, too.
[02:15:05.571 --> 02:15:10.596]  Just like they did with saying General Flynn was basically a Russian, that Trump ordered him during the campaign.
[02:15:10.856 --> 02:15:14.279]  They knew that was fake to do a stunt, and then they just suspend the guy for four weeks.
[02:15:14.279 --> 02:15:17.583]  I mean, they're doing this on purpose now, trying to desperately win.
[02:15:17.583 --> 02:15:21.447]  I want to ask you, in these news wars, how far will the fake news go?
[02:15:21.447 --> 02:15:29.715]  Because you've got fake onion stuff, like you said, that they try to say is the real issue and compare us to, while they're really the big corporate media putting out the big lies.
[02:15:29.715 --> 02:15:30.616]  Where does it all go?
[02:15:30.616 --> 02:15:32.057]  Mark Dice joins us.
[02:15:32.057 --> 02:15:33.498]  Stay with us, InfoWars.com.

[02:19:39.320 --> 02:19:50.942]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:19:50.942 --> 02:19:53.963]  They came and took it all away.
[02:19:54.591 --> 02:19:59.435]  By the well-connected...
[02:20:16.606 --> 02:20:21.190]  That's what the last so-called net neutrality bill was, was they take over the internet.
[02:20:21.190 --> 02:20:23.271]  You see massive censorship all over the subject.
[02:20:23.271 --> 02:20:29.877]  They try to censor those of us in the real news while they force-feed all their garbage.
[02:20:29.877 --> 02:20:32.939]  That's their answer to dwindling readership and viewership.
[02:20:32.939 --> 02:20:36.422]  The book's really a must.
[02:20:37.712 --> 02:20:40.514]  It's 225 pages long.
[02:20:40.514 --> 02:20:51.980]  It really should be university reading for people that are young journalism students, because it gives you just the most well-rounded perspective of documents, admissions, case point examples of how fake news works, what real fake news is.
[02:20:51.980 --> 02:20:54.682]  We all know the big corporate media is the most fake out there.
[02:20:54.682 --> 02:20:57.103]  I mean, a lot of what they report on isn't political, it's real.
[02:20:57.103 --> 02:21:04.307]  Like, there was a car crash here, or this baseball team won there, but when it's talking points, that's when the real propaganda flows.
[02:21:05.694 --> 02:21:15.043]  But the good news is their propaganda is so unified that rebooting Americana, promoting basic truths, is so infectious in their system that we're winning.
[02:21:15.043 --> 02:21:17.145]  So, Mark, let me ask you this question, just contemporarily.
[02:21:17.145 --> 02:21:18.005]  You can go through the whole book.
[02:21:18.005 --> 02:21:19.227]  We're going to take some calls in the next segment.
[02:21:19.227 --> 02:21:20.588]  A lot of folks calling in to talk to you.
[02:21:22.841 --> 02:21:25.243]  What do you make of the whole Russia narrative falling apart?
[02:21:25.243 --> 02:21:30.787]  And now all these FBI people caught colluding and admitting they're Democrats in emails and stuff.
[02:21:30.787 --> 02:21:32.288]  I mean, they're in a lot of trouble.
[02:21:32.288 --> 02:21:40.333]  As this whole thing seems to be coming apart faster, they try to censor faster, they try to get more oppressive, but that doesn't seem to work.
[02:21:40.333 --> 02:21:42.335]  Where do you see the landscape of this going?
[02:21:42.335 --> 02:21:47.659]  I mean, they say a lot of things happen more in a year than happened the previous hundred.
[02:21:47.659 --> 02:21:52.382]  When it comes to media and news and culture, I think we're in that magic moment right now.
[02:21:54.622 --> 02:21:56.243]  It looks like it's more than just fake news.
[02:21:56.243 --> 02:21:59.826]  It was a well-orchestrated fraud and a scam.
[02:21:59.826 --> 02:22:03.929]  And we've seen, you know, similar, less organized scams against Trump.
[02:22:03.929 --> 02:22:06.391]  Again, fake news is a two-way street.
[02:22:06.391 --> 02:22:09.574]  It's not just fake news about Hillary that coughed for the election.
[02:22:09.574 --> 02:22:17.800]  A lot of fake news about Trump, very well-orchestrated fake news, some of which was so inflammatory that some of the major networks didn't even carry it.
[02:22:18.160 --> 02:22:24.126]  Remember when 20th Century Fox and others got caught running hundreds of fake websites during the campaign that were anti-Trump?
[02:22:24.126 --> 02:22:24.507]  Remember that?
[02:22:26.005 --> 02:22:36.989]  ABC News just had to pay a $170 million fine for a defamation case because of a fake news story that they had been reporting on, on the supposed pink slime about the beef industry.
[02:22:36.989 --> 02:22:42.212]  That's almost an entire one-year profit that they had to pay because of fake news.
[02:22:42.212 --> 02:22:49.034]  I mean, we've seen over the past few decades, not just fake news, but fraud and scams.
[02:22:49.034 --> 02:22:51.795]  NBC was sued by General Motors back in the 90s.
[02:22:51.795 --> 02:22:52.936]  Making the cars blow up.
[02:22:53.556 --> 02:23:00.538]  Yeah, they literally staged cars exploding to do a story about potentially defective gas tanks.
[02:23:00.538 --> 02:23:17.784]  We've seen CBS recently edit the audio about those Facebook Live torture suspects or perpetrators trying to portray it on CBS as if it was a bunch of white kids torturing a black kid because, well, they referenced Donald Trump.
[02:23:18.539 --> 02:23:21.320]  NBC was sued after they doctored the audio.
[02:23:21.320 --> 02:23:22.140]  Oh, I gotta stop you.
[02:23:22.140 --> 02:23:23.501]  That's so huge.
[02:23:23.501 --> 02:23:29.023]  You got a bunch of black teens torturing a mentally retarded teenager, cutting part of his scalp off.
[02:23:29.023 --> 02:23:30.543]  The media first said it was fake.
[02:23:30.543 --> 02:23:39.466]  They would never show it was a white kid being tortured by blacks, live streaming it, and then turned it around and said they did it because they were white kids torturing a black kid because they love Trump.
[02:23:39.466 --> 02:23:40.807]  I mean, that is next level.
[02:23:41.874 --> 02:23:42.474]  That's fraud.
[02:23:42.474 --> 02:23:46.756]  That's actually what the audio on the CBS report says.
[02:23:46.756 --> 02:23:50.818]  They referenced Donald Trump and they called him the N-word.
[02:23:50.818 --> 02:23:54.660]  Well, they referenced Donald Trump by saying, you know, F-Donald Trump.
[02:23:54.660 --> 02:23:56.221]  You voted for Donald Trump.
[02:23:56.221 --> 02:23:56.761]  It's incredible.
[02:23:56.761 --> 02:23:58.622]  And we're going to kill you N-word doing.
[02:24:00.204 --> 02:24:05.467]  And that's why, in my book, The True Story of Fake News, there's a whole chapter on fake hate crimes.
[02:24:05.467 --> 02:24:12.931]  Because, as we've seen, the retraction gets maybe, what, 1%, 5% of the attention.
[02:24:12.931 --> 02:24:17.394]  We just saw the Navy Scroll, we just saw the Air Force Academy, all fake!
[02:24:18.379 --> 02:24:24.908]  And right after the election, we saw a bunch of fake stories, hoaxes coming out of people claiming that they were attacked by Trump supporters.
[02:24:24.908 --> 02:24:29.634]  A Muslim woman claimed that she was assaulted by some Trump supporters who stole her hijab.
[02:24:29.634 --> 02:24:33.179]  Almost every one of these big fake... The market goes beyond that!
[02:24:33.319 --> 02:24:35.780]  Then Hollywood and TV shows, as you know.
[02:24:35.780 --> 02:24:37.280]  I've seen it without even watching TV.
[02:24:37.280 --> 02:24:42.881]  I just see ads everywhere where white guys walk in and beat up women and, you know, behind the counter to hajibs.
[02:24:42.881 --> 02:24:45.882]  And then Muslims are being attacked, like, in all these TV shows.
[02:24:45.882 --> 02:24:46.902]  And none of it's real.
[02:24:46.902 --> 02:24:52.263]  But to go with the fake news, they've got Hollywood and TV productions that show it's happening.
[02:24:52.263 --> 02:24:53.103]  What do you call that?
[02:24:53.103 --> 02:24:57.024]  Like, when fake news meets fake entertainment to prop up the facade.
[02:24:58.086 --> 02:25:05.711]  Well, we call it the CIA's Entertainment Liaison Office, which literally works with Hollywood Studios.
[02:25:05.711 --> 02:25:07.352]  We've talked about this in the past.
[02:25:07.352 --> 02:25:16.118]  Many of the audience probably isn't familiar with this, but the Department of Defense, different branches within the military, the CIA, they literally have offices.
[02:25:16.118 --> 02:25:17.259]  This is an open secret.
[02:25:17.259 --> 02:25:18.580]  It's on the CIA's website.
[02:25:18.960 --> 02:25:21.081]  Well, Chris Carter has come out and said that we're right.
[02:25:47.056 --> 02:25:50.626]  Specifically naming about the CIA trying to control what they write.
[02:25:50.626 --> 02:25:52.370]  They would come to him and try to get him to do stuff.
[02:25:53.444 --> 02:25:59.565]  Yeah, people were really surprised about that, and that, well, you took them to X-Files as being infiltrated by the CIA.
[02:25:59.565 --> 02:26:04.646]  Well, it's an open secret that government agencies work with Hollywood studios.
[02:26:04.646 --> 02:26:16.929]  And because, you know, we're talking a little bit about entertainment, but, you know, fake news, propaganda entertainment, it really is all in the same... I was about to say, they've got five shows that currently air weekly or daily.
[02:26:17.549 --> 02:26:26.405]  That spoof Alex Jones, Homeland, the opposition, all these, where they say it's Alex Jones and then I say racist things, but it's not me.
[02:26:28.038 --> 02:26:38.801]  Well, let's not forget that there was actually a big Hollywood movie, Argo, back in 2012 with Ben Affleck about the CIA pretending to be a bunch of movie executives and movie studios.
[02:26:38.801 --> 02:26:40.642]  Yeah, that's the story in Iran.
[02:26:40.642 --> 02:26:43.043]  To go over and get the hostages out of Iran.
[02:26:43.043 --> 02:26:48.324]  So we've seen the intelligence agencies working with Hollywood studios for decades.
[02:26:48.324 --> 02:26:49.785]  It's an open secret.
[02:26:49.785 --> 02:26:52.846]  And television and movies, they shape the culture.
[02:26:53.246 --> 02:27:03.928]  I mean, back in the 1980s, shows like The Cosby Show and Different Strokes, I mean, those shows changed the way that America saw black families and interracial families.
[02:27:03.928 --> 02:27:05.849]  And so this television, it's a tool.
[02:27:05.849 --> 02:27:08.229]  It can be used for good, it can be used for bad.
[02:27:08.229 --> 02:27:20.332]  So while those shows were, you know, helping to show a different light, a different part of society that most people haven't seen, changing their, you know, preconceived notions about those kinds of things, we also see
[02:27:20.832 --> 02:27:27.838]  Well, you just said it.
[02:27:27.838 --> 02:27:32.341]  Early on, they used it for a lot of good things and they got good people involved.
[02:27:32.341 --> 02:27:36.825]  Now, it's pure race war, Christians are bad, sexualized children.
[02:27:36.825 --> 02:27:42.209]  There's no doubt now, the folks running these unconstitutional programs are bad people.
[02:27:43.798 --> 02:27:53.985]  It's no coincidence that the show 24 came out right after 9-11, which had Kiefer Sutherland torturing suspects to try to condition people that that was a good thing.
[02:27:53.985 --> 02:27:58.648]  We've seen even Jessica Chastain's film about hunting down Bin Laden.
[02:27:58.648 --> 02:28:09.015]  They portrayed torture as having been one of the reasons why they got the information on the compound, which was totally not true.
[02:28:09.015 --> 02:28:12.277]  We've seen so many instances of Hollywood movies
[02:28:13.323 --> 02:28:15.325]  You use it as propaganda tools.
[02:28:15.325 --> 02:28:18.388]  This is all part of the fake news industrial complex.
[02:28:18.388 --> 02:28:19.349]  Wow, it's incredible.
[02:28:19.349 --> 02:28:24.034]  And people should just... I know our audience is conscious, but I have to get conscious sometimes.
[02:28:24.034 --> 02:28:25.035]  I gotta forget.
[02:28:25.035 --> 02:28:26.056]  You just gotta be conscious.
[02:28:26.056 --> 02:28:26.656]  It's going on.
[02:28:26.656 --> 02:28:27.858]  Admit, no, it's really happening.
[02:28:27.858 --> 02:28:30.861]  We're gonna come out with Mark Dice, talk more about his new book, it's already a bestseller.

[02:33:05.805 --> 02:33:08.626]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:08.626 --> 02:33:10.926]  Live from Austin, Texas.
[02:33:10.926 --> 02:33:13.027]  Broadcasting worldwide.
[02:33:13.027 --> 02:33:15.428]  From the InfoWars.com studios.
[02:33:17.981 --> 02:33:23.364]  You know, my late great uncle would always say, you can't cheat an honest man.
[02:33:23.364 --> 02:33:29.207]  You can't con an honest man, because they're not into weird phlegm phlegm operations or strange stuff.
[02:33:29.207 --> 02:33:36.011]  And I was just thinking about the fact that CNN doesn't get it sometimes, or MSNBC.
[02:33:36.011 --> 02:33:37.292]  They both had articles last week.
[02:33:37.292 --> 02:33:40.114]  We covered them saying, Trump, keeper of promises.
[02:33:41.206 --> 02:33:44.851]  Another headline was like, you know, Amateur Trump Keeps Promises.
[02:33:44.851 --> 02:33:48.897]  I mean, I've seen hundreds of those the last year, but there were a couple last week.
[02:33:48.897 --> 02:33:51.361]  A couple on CNN and one on MSNBC.
[02:33:51.361 --> 02:33:53.164]  Basically written by the same person, it seemed like.
[02:33:54.451 --> 02:33:59.358]  Going, look, he's doing everything he said he would, and he's fighting hard, and he's such an idiot, man.
[02:33:59.358 --> 02:34:02.522]  All these folks that never did anything but hijack the country.
[02:34:02.522 --> 02:34:03.683]  So we can put those articles up.
[02:34:03.683 --> 02:34:05.986]  Just type in CNN.com searches.
[02:34:05.986 --> 02:34:06.467]  There it is.
[02:34:06.467 --> 02:34:08.129]  Trump's promises.
[02:34:08.129 --> 02:34:11.794]  And then the name of the headline when you click on it is, Trump, keeper of promises.
[02:34:12.602 --> 02:34:14.503]  So there's two different articles on CNN.
[02:34:14.503 --> 02:34:31.436]  TPP 100%, pipelines 90%, negotiate NAFTA, withdraw 80%, deport millions of illegals 30-40%, block Syrian refugees 70%, repeal Obamacare, he's past half now, halt Muslims in the U.S.
[02:34:31.436 --> 02:34:32.457]  70%, move the U.S.
[02:34:32.457 --> 02:34:35.660]  Embassy to Jerusalem 50%, withdraw from Paris Climate Agreement 100%.
[02:34:37.621 --> 02:34:41.143]  How much easier is life when you just do what you say?
[02:34:41.143 --> 02:34:44.446]  Gosh, I try to do what I say I'm going to do, and it's hard enough.
[02:34:44.446 --> 02:34:47.207]  I couldn't imagine lying or shock-refuge.
[02:34:47.207 --> 02:34:51.851]  One of my biggest problems is, even if I like somebody, I'll tell them point-blank what I think.
[02:34:51.851 --> 02:34:53.672]  They're like, well, no one's ever talked to me like that.
[02:34:53.672 --> 02:34:54.612]  You're really saying mean things.
[02:34:54.612 --> 02:34:56.674]  I'm like, no, I'm just saying what I really think.
[02:34:56.674 --> 02:34:59.115]  But that's on the other extreme.
[02:34:59.115 --> 02:35:03.178]  You've got people that lie on the other and just think it's the way the world works.
[02:35:03.178 --> 02:35:04.939]  The book is The True Story of Fake News.
[02:35:04.939 --> 02:35:05.800]  We're going back to it in a moment.
[02:35:07.193 --> 02:35:12.935]  Speaking of Trump, he's on right now with a giant wall of regulations that they just cut.
[02:35:12.935 --> 02:35:15.176]  That's a way to cut taxes, by the way.
[02:35:15.176 --> 02:35:16.177]  And it's already delivering.
[02:35:16.177 --> 02:35:17.858]  Let's play a few minutes of his live press conference.
[02:35:17.858 --> 02:35:21.419]  Here it is.
[02:35:21.419 --> 02:35:25.641]  And then we will... There was a big difference and we were going down.
[02:35:25.641 --> 02:35:28.822]  This country was going economically down.
[02:35:28.822 --> 02:35:32.524]  Small business optimism is at its highest point in 34 years.
[02:35:36.192 --> 02:35:38.813]  And we are just getting started.
[02:35:38.813 --> 02:35:46.196]  We have decades of excess regulation to remove to help launch the next phase of growth, prosperity, and freedom.
[02:35:46.196 --> 02:35:54.760]  I am challenging my cabinet to find and remove every single outdated, unlawful, and excessive regulation currently on the books.
[02:35:54.760 --> 02:36:02.323]  I want every cabinet secretary, agency head, and federal worker to push even harder to cut even more regulations
[02:36:03.363 --> 02:36:07.306]  In 2018, and that should just about do it.
[02:36:07.306 --> 02:36:11.969]  I don't know if we'll have any left to cut, but we'll always find them.
[02:36:11.969 --> 02:36:15.552]  We must liberate our economy from years of federal overreach.
[02:36:16.477 --> 02:36:17.998]  An intrusion.
[02:36:17.998 --> 02:36:20.480]  So that we can compete and win on the world stage.
[02:36:20.480 --> 02:36:21.840]  By the way, in private, same guy.
[02:36:21.840 --> 02:36:25.122]  When you look at the stock market and what's happening, such a high level.
[02:36:25.122 --> 02:36:25.683]  I'm committed, Alex.
[02:36:25.683 --> 02:36:26.423]  I want you to commit harder.
[02:36:26.423 --> 02:36:27.884]  There's a long way to go.
[02:36:27.884 --> 02:36:31.727]  Much of that is because of what we've done with regulation.
[02:36:31.727 --> 02:36:32.387]  It was live, I can't.
[02:36:32.387 --> 02:36:36.429]  For example, the current process for permitting infrastructure is unacceptably long.
[02:36:36.429 --> 02:36:37.490]  Stop it right there, it's just recorded.
[02:36:37.490 --> 02:36:39.251]  I'm going to play something with Ramport coming up.
[02:36:39.251 --> 02:36:40.352]  We've got Mark Dice here with us.
[02:36:40.352 --> 02:36:43.614]  I'm going to go to calls here in a moment, Mark, but other big tidbits.
[02:36:43.614 --> 02:36:44.915]  You just heard the point I made about
[02:36:45.936 --> 02:36:50.678]  They admit he's telling the truth, he's horrible, but he's a Russian agent even though they've been caught trying to frame him.
[02:36:50.678 --> 02:37:01.484]  I mean, if they're going to try to remove a president who is literally bringing the country back from the dead, that doesn't sound like a very smart political move, but instead they're betting it all on this male versus female crap.
[02:37:02.904 --> 02:37:07.586]  Two weeks after the 2016 election is when the fake news, you know, phenomenon really blew up.
[02:37:07.586 --> 02:37:20.990]  And then literally two weeks later, the Washington Post, which really was the first to start the fake news witch hunt and tie it to the supposed Russians, two weeks later then they admitted that the war against fake news has backfired.
[02:37:20.990 --> 02:37:24.191]  And this was the first year really... They said stop using it!
[02:37:24.191 --> 02:37:26.031]  CNN came on and said, stop!
[02:37:26.031 --> 02:37:26.311]  Stop!
[02:37:26.311 --> 02:37:26.552]  Wait!
[02:37:26.552 --> 02:37:26.812]  Wait!
[02:37:26.812 --> 02:37:27.192]  No!
[02:37:27.192 --> 02:37:27.712]  No, no, no!
[02:37:29.062 --> 02:37:31.383]  You know, everything that they're doing is only backfiring.
[02:37:31.383 --> 02:37:41.446]  If they would actually just criticize the president for legitimate criticisms, and if the Democrats had put out, you know, reasonable policy discussions, none of this would be happening.
[02:37:41.446 --> 02:37:46.267]  But this was the first election where social media played a huge role.
[02:37:46.267 --> 02:37:50.869]  Social media wasn't just a place to post, you know, pictures of what you were having for dinner.
[02:37:51.329 --> 02:38:00.915]  YouTube wasn't just a place to post funny cat videos or, you know, a funny video of, you know, somebody, you know, falling off their bike and getting hurt, a fail video.
[02:38:00.915 --> 02:38:08.119]  This was the first year, really, when social media was used as a powerful tool by people like me, people like you, a lot of people in this audience.
[02:38:08.119 --> 02:38:10.921]  And they admitted that fired, and Zuckerberg said, I promise I'll start censoring.
[02:38:11.914 --> 02:38:15.035]  Now, initially they said, well, fake news had nothing to do with it.
[02:38:15.035 --> 02:38:15.816]  We don't think so.
[02:38:15.816 --> 02:38:18.557]  There's, you know, hoaxes spread through Facebook sometimes.
[02:38:18.557 --> 02:38:21.198]  They've spread since, you know, it started.
[02:38:21.198 --> 02:38:29.742]  I mean, we all remember some of the earlier hoaxes about posting a comment about opting out of one of their new, you know, terms of service.
[02:38:29.742 --> 02:38:30.702]  And then everyone starts.
[02:38:30.702 --> 02:38:33.843]  So hoaxes have spread through Facebook since the beginning.
[02:38:33.843 --> 02:38:37.265]  But there's been studies that have been done by Stanford, New York University,
[02:38:37.865 --> 02:38:38.025]  Yeah.
[02:38:54.394 --> 02:39:02.639]  Very few people, in fact, some people were, but very few were actually... It's a hoax to say that independent, grassroots fake news gave it to Trump.
[02:39:02.639 --> 02:39:11.525]  We had Google, Facebook, Twitter, the EU, the globalists, Hollywood, mainstream media, all the money, you know, 10 to 1, thrown against Trump, American people, they lost.
[02:39:11.525 --> 02:39:13.086]  So where do you see this going now, Mark?
[02:39:13.086 --> 02:39:15.588]  They've had their candy butts handed to them.
[02:39:17.168 --> 02:39:19.370]  I think the manipulation is going to get a little bit more slick.
[02:39:19.370 --> 02:39:29.781]  We're probably going to see Twitter continue to roll out new manipulations on the trending, new stricter terms of service are rolling out about certain symbols and terms that you're not supposed to use.
[02:39:29.781 --> 02:39:31.342]  And it's all selectively enforced.
[02:39:31.342 --> 02:39:35.086]  Keith Overman can say murder Trump, murder, murder, murder.
[02:39:35.086 --> 02:39:36.708]  We call somebody a liar, they're banned.
[02:39:37.268 --> 02:39:43.496]  Or Trump says that Don Lemon is stupid and they go, oh it's bullying.
[02:39:43.496 --> 02:39:47.501]  You can't say a public figure that's attacking you and calling you evil is dumb.
[02:39:47.501 --> 02:39:50.926]  He can attack, Don Lemon can attack, but you're not allowed to call him dumb.
[02:39:51.894 --> 02:39:52.054]  Yeah.
[02:40:12.734 --> 02:40:14.335]  On the day of inauguration.
[02:40:14.335 --> 02:40:15.575]  It would have been national news.
[02:40:15.575 --> 02:40:17.416]  There would have been dozens of arrests.
[02:40:17.416 --> 02:40:24.319]  These suspects would have been touted out on the national scene and shown to the whole country, to the whole world.
[02:40:24.319 --> 02:40:30.402]  There wasn't even a Wikipedia page specifically for assassination threats against Trump until recently.
[02:40:30.402 --> 02:40:36.285]  There was a page, or still is rather, a page dedicated to threats about Obama.
[02:40:36.285 --> 02:40:38.506]  But at the time that my book came out, just last month,
[02:40:39.204 --> 02:40:51.958]  Or when I was writing it, when I was getting ready to publish it, there was not a page dedicated or even a section on Trump's Twitter or Wikipedia page about the death threats, even though there were tens of thousands of them on Twitter.
[02:40:51.958 --> 02:40:53.019]  That's another question, Mark.
[02:40:53.019 --> 02:40:54.000]  I want your take on this.
[02:40:54.000 --> 02:40:55.181]  We're going to go to break, go to calls.
[02:40:55.922 --> 02:41:01.903]  I don't remember who said it, but there's an old saying that a lie can make it halfway around the world before the truth puts its shoes on in the morning.
[02:41:01.903 --> 02:41:02.203]  Mark Twain.
[02:41:25.017 --> 02:41:29.979]  That's why they keep putting out these ridiculous fake stories because they know that it's going to reinforce.
[02:41:29.979 --> 02:41:36.762]  That's what they're trying to do, is trying to reinforce what they've already put out there, that Trump is bad, that this is a fascist regime.
[02:41:36.762 --> 02:41:42.065]  And so when they have to issue retractions or apologies, CNN doesn't even do it on their main Twitter account.
[02:41:42.065 --> 02:41:44.526]  They have a special Twitter account, CNN Public Relations.
[02:41:44.526 --> 02:41:49.768]  No, it's like you're allowed to kidnap and murder children as long as you apologize to an empty room, it's okay.
[02:41:49.768 --> 02:41:50.929]  It's a get-out-of-jail-free card.
[02:41:52.301 --> 02:41:53.923]  Yeah, and so that's what they're doing.
[02:41:53.923 --> 02:41:59.128]  They're reinforcing this already insane ideology that they've whipped up.
[02:41:59.128 --> 02:42:00.990]  The retractions get no footing.
[02:42:00.990 --> 02:42:02.953]  Nobody hears about the retractions.
[02:42:02.953 --> 02:42:07.417]  And also I think what they're trying to do is to get the short-term gains of the clicks for their website.
[02:42:07.417 --> 02:42:08.559]  So we need to really stop
[02:42:09.840 --> 02:42:13.102]  Posting some of their insane articles to show people what they're doing.
[02:42:13.102 --> 02:42:18.485]  A lot of people will post an article on Facebook and say, look at what this ridiculous CNN article is saying.
[02:42:18.485 --> 02:42:19.145]  They don't care.
[02:42:19.145 --> 02:42:22.488]  Stop doing that because then you're just driving more traffic to their website.
[02:42:22.488 --> 02:42:24.689]  Post a screenshot or just talk about it.
[02:42:24.689 --> 02:42:24.869]  Exactly.
[02:42:24.869 --> 02:42:29.232]  They're like trolling us now with the insanity, using our names to do it.
[02:42:29.232 --> 02:42:30.152]  Great point, Mark Dice.
[02:42:30.152 --> 02:42:32.354]  In fact, in the book you just say, turn it all off.
[02:42:32.354 --> 02:42:35.456]  You've got a plan I agree with to shut them down once and for all.
[02:42:36.755 --> 02:42:56.727]  I want to plow into all of this, but I'm going to spend a few minutes here first, just encouraging listeners to understand that when you buy t-shirts, or water filtration systems, or books, or videos, or other material from InfoWarsTore.com, you are funding the revolution.
[02:42:56.727 --> 02:42:58.849]  I mean, I cannot say it any clearer.

[02:46:50.087 --> 02:47:02.736]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Mark Dice from Southern California.
[02:47:03.915 --> 02:47:05.676]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[02:47:05.676 --> 02:47:06.917]  We're broadcasting worldwide.
[02:47:06.917 --> 02:47:08.658]  I'll be co-hosting with John Rappaport coming up.
[02:47:08.658 --> 02:47:10.079]  Bunch of clips and news I haven't gotten to.
[02:47:10.079 --> 02:47:11.880]  We've got loaded phone lines for Mark.
[02:47:11.880 --> 02:47:14.462]  We really shouldn't cheat these folks and let them talk to Mark.
[02:47:14.462 --> 02:47:21.547]  We'll do that to Matt and Mel D and Salvador and others here in just a moment.
[02:47:21.547 --> 02:47:24.168]  But Mark, I want your real take on this.
[02:47:24.168 --> 02:47:27.791]  I know you'll give it your real news take, but I've tried to study net neutrality.
[02:47:28.985 --> 02:47:29.766]  I'm trying to study all this.
[02:47:29.766 --> 02:47:30.466]  It's very complex.
[02:47:59.125 --> 02:48:03.628]  Yeah, there are some strong arguments on both sides.
[02:48:03.628 --> 02:48:10.412]  I think that many people on both sides of the issue are getting a little bit too hyped up and a little bit too concerned.
[02:48:10.412 --> 02:48:13.234]  I'm all for undoing almost anything that Obama did.
[02:48:13.234 --> 02:48:17.796]  We know that he basically turned the entire internet over to the United Nations.
[02:48:20.798 --> 02:48:23.961]  These big tech companies gobbling up smaller companies.
[02:48:23.961 --> 02:48:30.025]  A lot of this happens, most of this, at what's called the Sun Valley Conference, which is Bilderberg for tech.
[02:48:30.025 --> 02:48:35.770]  And this is an annual media conference that happens every July in Sun Valley, Idaho.
[02:48:35.770 --> 02:48:38.772]  Not in New York City, not in Los Angeles.
[02:48:38.772 --> 02:48:45.337]  All the tech companies and media moguls go to the small little town of 1,500 people every summer since 1983.
[02:48:46.998 --> 02:48:58.824]  This is where they put on the auctioning block all these smaller little media companies and decide which ones they're going to buy up, who's going to merge with who, what the coming terms of service are going to be.
[02:48:58.824 --> 02:49:00.345]  This isn't just an auctioning table.
[02:49:00.345 --> 02:49:04.187]  This is where they collude like the oil companies got caught in the 70s fixing prices.
[02:49:04.187 --> 02:49:08.769]  This is where they collude on what they're going to do lobbying-wise to get stuff done in Congress.
[02:49:09.585 --> 02:49:15.088]  This is where Microsoft merged with NBC to create MSNBC.
[02:49:15.088 --> 02:49:18.470]  This is where Facebook purchased Instagram.
[02:49:18.470 --> 02:49:26.555]  This is where most of the big major telemarketing or telecom... This is where, you know, they talked a year ago about where Disney would buy News Corp.
[02:49:28.072 --> 02:49:34.414]  This is where Google's initial IPO was settled and organized.
[02:49:34.414 --> 02:49:39.435]  This is where also the head of the CIA usually goes, or former CIA officials.
[02:49:39.435 --> 02:49:40.195]  And when is it happening?
[02:49:40.195 --> 02:49:41.276]  Because we need to send reporters.
[02:49:41.276 --> 02:49:45.937]  This is the digital Bilderberg that you keep harping on that I should pay attention to.
[02:49:45.937 --> 02:49:50.318]  Yes, it happens every July, usually about the first week into July.
[02:49:50.318 --> 02:49:51.718]  Hey, why don't we both go this year?
[02:49:51.718 --> 02:49:52.679]  You can go with us.
[02:49:52.679 --> 02:49:53.739]  I'll finance you going, Mark.
[02:49:55.744 --> 02:49:57.966]  That's definitely a possibility.
[02:49:57.966 --> 02:50:03.730]  One of the other issues of fake news, it's not just lying, it's actually lying by omission.
[02:50:03.730 --> 02:50:10.155]  And that's why these big media companies prevent certain issues, certain topics from making it into the mainstream.
[02:50:10.155 --> 02:50:14.578]  That's why the Bilderberg Group has never really been mainstream news.
[02:50:14.578 --> 02:50:19.882]  Only with social media, and with you, and with the Drudge covering it, has it been mentioned a little bit.
[02:50:19.882 --> 02:50:22.024]  And notice, as soon as it got exposed, it lost its power.
[02:50:23.713 --> 02:50:29.100]  Even if it was mentioned, it was usually on some small little article at the bottom of the page, on the website.
[02:50:29.100 --> 02:50:31.584]  It certainly didn't lead, or it wasn't even mentioned on the broadcast.
[02:50:31.584 --> 02:50:35.909]  Mark, you remember, even ten years ago, you've been doing this 15-16, and I remember, they would say it didn't exist.
[02:50:35.909 --> 02:50:36.250]  Remember that?
[02:50:37.165 --> 02:50:41.806]  Yeah, you're a conspiracy theorist for talking about this and thinking that these big moguls meet.
[02:50:41.806 --> 02:50:50.529]  Now look, it's an interesting story when you have a hundred of the world's most powerful men in a variety of different sectors from politics and banking and media all meeting together.
[02:50:50.529 --> 02:50:51.629]  That's a story.
[02:50:51.629 --> 02:50:52.450]  That's an interesting story.
[02:50:52.450 --> 02:50:53.190]  Yeah, it's collusion!
[02:50:53.410 --> 02:50:54.771]  I mean, it violates the Logan Act.
[02:50:54.771 --> 02:50:55.211]  Exactly.
[02:50:55.211 --> 02:50:56.031]  Mark Dice is our guest.

[02:51:04.994 --> 02:51:08.696]  But I will sign the first 500 or however many orders come in before Christmas.

[02:51:32.406 --> 02:51:34.367]  Okay, Mark Dice is our guest.
[02:51:34.367 --> 02:51:37.209]  Let's talk to, hmm, Matt in Pennsylvania.
[02:51:37.209 --> 02:51:39.570]  I'm gonna go to Salvador and Melody.
[02:51:39.570 --> 02:51:39.870]  Go ahead.
[02:51:41.670 --> 02:51:42.431]  Hey guys, can you hear me?
[02:51:42.431 --> 02:51:44.192]  Yes, sir.
[02:51:44.192 --> 02:51:53.279]  Hey, so, more people need to rise up and get involved with grassroots journalism, and that's what we're doing in Hanover, Pennsylvania with The Daily Informer.
[02:51:53.279 --> 02:52:01.646]  So, I called in a couple times before, and we have a little blog that I share with you, thedailyinformer.net, and we just pretty much aggregate and share a bunch of your guys' articles and stuff.
[02:52:02.230 --> 02:52:02.730]  I totally agree.
[02:52:19.326 --> 02:52:19.927]  I totally agree.
[02:52:19.927 --> 02:52:31.498]  How do we get locals involved in national and local news and help make businesses money being part of having new digital local papers, filling the gaps of local papers that are establishment run?
[02:52:31.498 --> 02:52:32.639]  That's something we're looking at.
[02:52:32.639 --> 02:52:34.221]  So we'll get your name and number.
[02:52:34.221 --> 02:52:40.087]  I want to talk to you because funding for independent media, we have the audiences, but then how do we get the funding?
[02:52:40.087 --> 02:52:42.229]  Is that what you're getting at, Matt?
[02:52:42.229 --> 02:52:43.230]  It is, yeah.
[02:52:43.797 --> 02:52:45.020]  It's really unique.
[02:52:54.767 --> 02:53:00.050]  A million plus people, you know, every day or so on your YouTube with a million subscribers is part of what you do.
[02:53:00.050 --> 02:53:01.631]  And I may reach, you know, that or whatever.
[02:53:01.631 --> 02:53:02.391]  That's part of what we do.
[02:53:02.391 --> 02:53:09.295]  But if they don't financially just do something every once in a while, we can't fund what we're doing or expanding.
[02:53:09.295 --> 02:53:11.596]  I mean, Mark, I'd love to see you with 30 crew members.
[02:53:11.596 --> 02:53:12.856]  I mean, it'd be awesome.
[02:53:12.856 --> 02:53:18.159]  I want to see what real people that aren't globalists would do with a larger media operation.
[02:53:18.159 --> 02:53:21.241]  Because if it's a one-man show or a two-man show, you're already kicking ass.
[02:53:22.759 --> 02:53:23.199]  Thanks, Broden.
[02:53:23.199 --> 02:53:27.901]  It's been a pleasure to watch your operation grow over the last 10-12 years since I've been part of the show.
[02:53:27.901 --> 02:53:28.561]  It's amazing.
[02:53:28.561 --> 02:53:37.143]  And that's one of the reasons why they're coming after all of us financially, is with the YouTube adpocalypse, with preventing videos from being monetized.
[02:53:37.143 --> 02:53:41.885]  My YouTube channel was making more money when I had literally one-tenth of the subscribers.
[02:53:42.365 --> 02:53:42.825]  Thank you.
[02:54:06.957 --> 02:54:10.618]  They now admit with Alexa and all these systems, they're doing it in your house.
[02:54:10.618 --> 02:54:13.720]  You don't own cats, but if you joke about cats, you get cat food ads.
[02:54:13.720 --> 02:54:14.600]  It's confirmed.
[02:54:14.600 --> 02:54:17.261]  They're listening to you.
[02:54:17.261 --> 02:54:29.145]  You know, I was putting out YouTube videos for, I think, six years before I even made a penny off of them, before the channel was even monetized, because it was the passion, because I just wanted to get the information out there with the new tools that were available.
[02:54:29.145 --> 02:54:30.306]  And they banned you a couple times.
[02:54:31.081 --> 02:54:32.462]  They deleted the whole channel.
[02:54:32.462 --> 02:54:34.244]  They've had videos of mine pulled down.
[02:54:34.244 --> 02:54:35.605]  I have to appeal them.
[02:54:35.605 --> 02:54:36.606]  It's a constant.
[02:54:36.606 --> 02:54:38.387]  It's constantly under threat.
[02:54:38.387 --> 02:54:47.795]  But what's so interesting about this last election cycle and even, you know, 2017, the Trump supporters, the Trump train, we didn't fall asleep at the wheel.
[02:54:47.795 --> 02:54:51.298]  We didn't kind of go back into our regular mode.
[02:54:51.298 --> 02:54:52.539]  We're getting more engaged.
[02:54:52.539 --> 02:54:54.521]  And that's why they're so upset.
[02:54:54.521 --> 02:54:55.402]  And what you just said.
[02:54:55.922 --> 02:54:56.783]  We're not complaining.
[02:54:56.783 --> 02:54:57.283]  We want to win.
[02:54:57.283 --> 02:54:57.944]  We're not whiners.
[02:54:57.944 --> 02:54:58.885]  We're not SJWs.
[02:54:58.885 --> 02:55:07.792]  But behind every big channel is hell, is war, is having all your money cut off, is being harassed, is being stuff I can't even get into on air at my level.
[02:55:07.792 --> 02:55:09.994]  Understand, it's not just, oh, a video you see.
[02:55:09.994 --> 02:55:11.875]  Somebody lost their job.
[02:55:11.875 --> 02:55:13.236]  Somebody lost their wife.
[02:55:13.236 --> 02:55:14.517]  Somebody got harassed.
[02:55:14.517 --> 02:55:16.099]  Somebody got their house shot up.
[02:55:16.099 --> 02:55:17.700]  Somebody had people come out with their family.
[02:55:17.700 --> 02:55:19.021]  I mean, this is a war.
[02:55:19.021 --> 02:55:20.923]  The good news is, I think we're starting to win though, Mark.
[02:55:22.490 --> 02:55:30.992]  It is, and we don't talk about a lot of the, you know, some of the bad side that comes with this job, because we don't want to highlight it, we don't want to encourage other people, we just want to keep going straight forward.
[02:55:30.992 --> 02:55:42.035]  But it is a difficult position, and when we see the attacks that are coming against us personally, financially, legally... But I've noticed you've gone from being pretty good to super hardcore under attack.
[02:55:42.035 --> 02:55:47.837]  I mean, I never talked about this personally, but is that what's made you a lot more hardcore and focused, is that you've gone through a lot of hell?
[02:55:49.409 --> 02:55:50.770]  I think it's made me a lot stronger.
[02:55:50.770 --> 02:55:53.872]  I think that that's, you know, sort of going through the fire.
[02:55:53.872 --> 02:55:55.633]  It just solidifies me.
[02:55:55.633 --> 02:55:59.136]  The pressure has turned me into a diamond, so to speak.
[02:55:59.136 --> 02:56:08.762]  And it just, every time they try to come at me, thinking that they're going to scare me, that they're going to slow me down, I just keep going and I'll highlight the issues, I'll highlight the censorship.
[02:56:08.762 --> 02:56:13.025]  Some of the stuff I don't talk about, it's taken care of, you know, behind the scenes.
[02:56:13.025 --> 02:56:15.167]  But it's a tough battle.
[02:56:15.767 --> 02:56:20.911]  And we see the mainstream media, people need to know that these talking heads on television are millionaires.
[02:56:20.911 --> 02:56:27.695]  I mean, Joe Scarborough was making $100,000 a week according to his divorce documents, which we've all seen.
[02:56:27.695 --> 02:56:34.139]  And we have Matt Lauer is making $20, $30 million a year to sit on television.
[02:56:34.139 --> 02:56:37.902]  Eli Anderson Cooper is probably making $20 million.
[02:56:37.902 --> 02:56:44.106]  These people are celebrity journalists and we're over here on a shoestring budget growing our audience.
[02:56:44.626 --> 02:56:48.130]  Bigger than them, because people are tired of the lies.
[02:56:48.130 --> 02:56:49.631]  People are sharing our material.
[02:56:49.631 --> 02:56:52.554]  Exactly, so everybody get the true story of Fake News.

[02:57:08.469 --> 02:57:09.130]  Straight ahead, but yeah.
[02:57:10.390 --> 02:57:11.831]  The problem is libertarians are patriots.
[02:57:11.831 --> 02:57:13.132]  We don't whine about being attacked.
[02:57:13.132 --> 02:57:14.173]  We just don't even talk about it.
[02:57:14.173 --> 02:57:14.574]  That's what we do.
[02:57:14.574 --> 02:57:16.535]  But you need to know, we're on target.
[02:57:16.535 --> 02:57:19.218]  We're destroying the enemy, but we're under heavy enemy fire.
[02:57:19.218 --> 02:57:22.721]  We need support if you want us to kamikaze their ass.
[02:57:22.721 --> 02:57:25.583]  I just want to have a full detonation load when I slam in.
[02:57:25.583 --> 02:57:26.104]  That's what you do.
[02:57:26.784 --> 02:57:42.159]  Hey, if you want to slow down your aging process and protect your heart and brain from constant exposure to harmful toxins, then you need DNA Force, the most complete, full-spectrum, age-defying, cell-protecting formula in the world.

[02:58:10.589 --> 02:58:10.769]  Yeah!
[02:58:27.560 --> 02:58:30.523]  Top scientists and researchers agree.
[02:58:30.523 --> 02:58:39.670]  We are being hit by toxic weapons in the food and water supply that are making us fat, sick, and stupid.
[02:58:39.670 --> 02:58:41.031]  So what do we do about it?
[02:58:41.031 --> 02:58:44.174]  Well, for starters, don't just sit there and take it.

[02:59:45.233 --> 02:59:48.675]  How Mainstream Media Manipulates Millions.
[02:59:48.675 --> 02:59:50.776]  Waging War on Corruption.
[02:59:50.776 --> 02:59:53.758]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:59:53.758 --> 02:59:57.161]  Alright, Melo-D in New Jersey, then Salvador.
[02:59:57.161 --> 02:59:58.041]  Thanks for holding Melo-D.
[02:59:58.041 --> 02:59:59.322]  You're on the air with Mark Dice.
[02:59:59.322 --> 03:00:01.764]  The new book, The True Story of Fake News at InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:00:01.764 --> 03:00:03.585]  And I know you all know all about it.
[03:00:04.025 --> 03:00:06.728]  Alex, I'm just so glad to get through and I have a couple points I just want to say.
[03:00:06.728 --> 03:00:09.050]  I do have a question for Mark if I could just get these out.
[03:00:22.017 --> 03:00:26.119]  First, I want to just give a shout-out to the Ron Gibson channel on YouTube.
[03:00:26.119 --> 03:00:29.300]  They broadcast your show all day, every day.
[03:00:29.300 --> 03:00:34.683]  You have a bunch of Patriots over there, thousands of subscribers, and just, I really want to give them a shout-out.
[03:00:34.683 --> 03:00:35.723]  They deserve it.
[03:00:35.723 --> 03:00:37.004]  Sure, everybody can see my show.
[03:00:37.004 --> 03:00:37.744]  Knock yourselves out.
[03:00:37.744 --> 03:00:38.264]  Great job.
[03:00:38.264 --> 03:00:39.485]  Go ahead.
[03:00:39.485 --> 03:00:46.048]  If you could also, you were talking about bumper music, Declaration Day by Iced Earth is a phenomenal, powerful song.
[03:00:47.043 --> 03:00:57.298]  Um, if you could ask Dr. Group to make some kind of artery declogger, you know, to clean out the plaque maybe with grapes or something, because you guys are so innovative with your products.
[03:00:57.927 --> 03:01:03.652]  I mean, I just have an idea that maybe if you didn't have it already... Well, they say that vodka is what does that.
[03:01:03.652 --> 03:01:07.276]  I mean, the thing that keeps you clogging your arteries is alcohol that eats your liver.
[03:01:07.276 --> 03:01:10.438]  So it's kind of a catch-22, but yeah, we'll look into that.
[03:01:10.438 --> 03:01:17.385]  You know, all of our new products, the Real Red Pill, it is good for cholesterol and a lot of other things, but that's a great point.
[03:01:17.385 --> 03:01:18.005]  Thank you so much.
[03:01:18.005 --> 03:01:19.447]  MeloD, do you have a question for Mark Dice?
[03:01:20.675 --> 03:01:23.918]  One other point, I wanted to ask your permission for really quick.
[03:01:23.918 --> 03:01:27.081]  I'm a musician in a band and I want to write a song.
[03:01:27.081 --> 03:01:34.448]  And I want to take the song, the cover of the Rolling Stone by Dr. Hook, and I want to change it to, they're gonna kill Alex Jones.
[03:01:34.448 --> 03:01:35.389]  But I wanted to ask your permission.
[03:01:35.389 --> 03:01:36.490]  Oh, that's a good luck song.
[03:01:36.490 --> 03:01:37.531]  Let me just say this, sir.
[03:01:37.531 --> 03:01:38.813]  You don't need my permission.
[03:01:38.813 --> 03:01:41.696]  It's fair use of a public figure to use my name or do whatever.
[03:01:41.696 --> 03:01:43.978]  You just can't take the works we do and claim you on them.
[03:01:43.978 --> 03:01:44.979]  Do you have a question for Mark Dice?
[03:01:45.780 --> 03:01:46.200]  Yeah, they do.
[03:01:46.200 --> 03:01:50.783]  I wanted to ask Mark, will you ever come out to the East Coast to do a video?
[03:01:50.783 --> 03:01:51.323]  Great question.
[03:01:51.323 --> 03:01:52.143]  Thank you, Melody.
[03:01:52.143 --> 03:01:53.184]  I gotta go to Salvador.
[03:01:53.184 --> 03:01:55.405]  Will you ever come out to the East Coast?
[03:01:55.405 --> 03:01:58.987]  He's talking about my Man on the Street interviews.
[03:01:58.987 --> 03:01:59.447]  I don't know.
[03:01:59.447 --> 03:02:05.310]  I mean, it would be interesting to test to see how people out there would react versus the, you know, Southern California beach zombies.
[03:02:05.310 --> 03:02:11.093]  But I don't know if I have any, you know, national tour booked just yet.
[03:02:13.260 --> 03:02:14.320]  Alright, good answer.
[03:02:14.320 --> 03:02:15.561]  Salvador in San Diego.
[03:02:15.561 --> 03:02:16.521]  Let's call him from Mark Dice.
[03:02:16.521 --> 03:02:19.522]  Go ahead.
[03:02:19.522 --> 03:02:20.222]  Hello, Salvador.
[03:02:20.222 --> 03:02:26.364]  Alright, Salvador may have held a little too long.
[03:02:26.364 --> 03:02:28.685]  Mark, in the last two minutes... Oh, can you guys... Okay, go ahead, Salvador.
[03:02:28.685 --> 03:02:30.626]  Yes, how are you guys doing?
[03:02:30.626 --> 03:02:31.046]  Good.
[03:02:31.046 --> 03:02:32.726]  Yes, well, I'm calling from San Diego.
[03:02:32.726 --> 03:02:38.248]  I've seen the... I've seen the videos of Mark Dice in the Oceanside Pier, I believe.
[03:02:38.248 --> 03:02:38.768]  Yep.
[03:02:38.768 --> 03:02:39.789]  If I'm right.
[03:02:39.789 --> 03:02:39.949]  Yes.
[03:02:40.951 --> 03:02:50.354]  I just hope that material like this, like the book that you wrote, can be translated into Spanish.
[03:02:50.354 --> 03:02:57.936]  Because I believe there's, well, there needs to be an outreach to the immigrant community here.
[03:02:57.936 --> 03:02:58.956]  I totally agree.
[03:02:58.956 --> 03:03:02.317]  Spanish is probably the biggest language in the world now, other than English and Chinese.
[03:03:02.317 --> 03:03:03.097]  It's one of the big three.
[03:03:03.097 --> 03:03:09.299]  We all need to have, because I found people who speak Spanish is one of the most awake, hungry groups out there.
[03:03:09.299 --> 03:03:09.959]  That's a great point.
[03:03:09.959 --> 03:03:10.379]  Mark Dyson?
[03:03:11.434 --> 03:03:12.996]  They're very family-oriented as well.
[03:03:12.996 --> 03:03:15.699]  They're very traditional, very conservative.
[03:03:15.699 --> 03:03:20.764]  Obviously, there's some issues that some of them have with Trump's immigration policy, but they're fantastic people.
[03:03:20.764 --> 03:03:22.066]  I hope people will check out the book.
[03:03:22.066 --> 03:03:27.612]  It's a lot more serious of a side than a lot of my videos, and it's really the entire
[03:03:28.292 --> 03:03:31.894]  History of fake news, which goes beyond, you know, just in the last year.
[03:03:31.894 --> 03:03:45.141]  I mean, it's hundreds of years old, and a lot of examples of the power of propaganda, the building mountains out of Moorhills, how the media functions, the mechanisms at work, some of these organizations that are working behind the scenes.
[03:03:45.141 --> 03:03:50.203]  And so, you know, I always enjoy coming on with you, Alex, because people can kind of see a more serious side to me.
[03:03:50.203 --> 03:03:51.064]  Yeah, you're doing great.
[03:03:51.064 --> 03:03:52.624]  All your videos are great.
[03:03:52.624 --> 03:03:53.465]  Salvador, anything else?
[03:03:55.063 --> 03:03:55.564]  I guess.
[03:03:55.564 --> 03:04:02.598]  Like I said, I was down there in Baja and I can't believe we were talking about the Alex Jones Channel in Baja.
[03:04:04.467 --> 03:04:14.434]  Absolutely Salvador, we need to do it.
[03:04:14.434 --> 03:04:14.995]  God bless you.
[03:04:14.995 --> 03:04:16.836]  Mark Dice, we'll have you back soon.
[03:04:16.836 --> 03:04:19.398]  Have a great Christmas with your family.
[03:04:19.398 --> 03:04:23.101]  And coming up is the one, the only, John Rappaport, NoMoreFakeNews.com.
[03:04:23.101 --> 03:04:27.704]  All right, shotgun, Aaron's been holding so long, along with Kyan or Kenyon.
[03:04:27.704 --> 03:04:28.925]  I'm going to go to both of you after this.
[03:04:28.925 --> 03:04:29.686]  Thank you, Mark Dice.

[03:05:47.522 --> 03:05:50.464]  The cure to fake news.
[03:05:50.464 --> 03:05:56.107]  Coming to you live from Austin, Texas.
[03:05:56.107 --> 03:05:59.950]  Resistance base number one, ladies and gentlemen, outside the White House.
[03:05:59.950 --> 03:06:01.891]  This is it.
[03:06:01.891 --> 03:06:07.715]  We're a ragtag band, but we carry the light in the dark of the night.
[03:06:07.715 --> 03:06:09.396]  And that's what this season is all about, isn't it?
[03:06:11.431 --> 03:06:13.732]  They're never going to stop the fires of liberty.
[03:06:13.732 --> 03:06:15.694]  Burn, baby, burn.
[03:06:15.694 --> 03:06:17.355]  Crank it up for a minute.
[03:06:17.355 --> 03:06:21.817]  Yeah, there's nothing going to stop it.
[03:06:21.817 --> 03:06:28.902]  All you parasites.
[03:06:28.902 --> 03:06:32.364]  Says I set my eyes on you.
[03:06:32.364 --> 03:06:35.486]  Oh, baby, it's true.
[03:06:35.486 --> 03:06:40.228]  All right.
[03:06:40.228 --> 03:06:40.609]  We've got
[03:06:41.420 --> 03:06:45.143]  John Rappaport about to take over, but I literally have these callers hold for hours.
[03:06:45.143 --> 03:06:53.010]  So Aaron's getting a free t-shirt or whatever they want, you know, a bottle of Rainforce X2, I don't care.
[03:06:53.010 --> 03:06:54.992]  So is Kenyon in Ohio.
[03:06:54.992 --> 03:07:03.059]  I'm going to finish these two callers and then I'm going to eject without taking too much time from John Rappaport, who joins us every few weeks in the fourth hour.
[03:07:03.059 --> 03:07:05.522]  We are lining up some stuff as soon as we get all the bureaucracy going.
[03:07:06.062 --> 03:07:07.583]  Hey, I appreciate it.
[03:07:07.583 --> 03:07:10.706]  I've been a long-time listener over 10 years, and I can't help but be a patriot.
[03:07:32.009 --> 03:07:39.153]  Um, my sixth great-grandfather, Constantine Clarkson, fought the British at Camden and again at Greensboro.
[03:07:39.153 --> 03:07:40.234]  I can't help it.
[03:07:40.234 --> 03:07:43.096]  But when is enough enough, Alex?
[03:07:43.096 --> 03:07:46.338]  When, when is it enough?
[03:07:46.338 --> 03:07:51.541]  We try emails, calls, protesting, and it does nothing.
[03:07:52.279 --> 03:07:55.201]  You know, I tried to get my word out- Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.
[03:07:55.201 --> 03:08:04.966]  We've got a president in, most of the governors are going Patriot, we're winning everywhere, things are turning around, the globalists are trying to get violent, to get us into violence, because they're losing.
[03:08:04.966 --> 03:08:06.607]  Hold on, let me ask John Rudford that question.
[03:08:06.607 --> 03:08:14.731]  Because I'm not saying you're wrong, we've been abused, we have a right to physically stand up, but you can't just do it to an institution that's full of good and bad people.
[03:08:14.731 --> 03:08:18.453]  You have to know how to pick your enemies, pick your times, pick your battles, I mean,
[03:08:19.133 --> 03:08:19.874]  Are we winning?
[03:08:19.874 --> 03:08:20.614]  Are we losing?
[03:08:20.614 --> 03:08:22.615]  I mean, this is an important question.
[03:08:22.615 --> 03:08:23.456]  When is enough enough?
[03:08:23.456 --> 03:08:26.638]  I mean, I think we've really already had some big victories of late.
[03:08:26.638 --> 03:08:28.199]  I think the tide's turning.
[03:08:28.199 --> 03:08:32.461]  They want to push us into violence because I think that's the only purview they think they might win.
[03:08:32.461 --> 03:08:33.782]  Quite frankly, I think we'll win that, too.
[03:08:33.782 --> 03:08:36.904]  It's just going to be a pretty serious situation.
[03:08:36.904 --> 03:08:39.045]  And who knows what war will kick off with some other country.
[03:08:39.045 --> 03:08:40.326]  Because it's like a disease.
[03:08:40.326 --> 03:08:41.967]  It's like a fever.
[03:08:41.967 --> 03:08:44.288]  Once the big violence breaks out, it tends to spread.
[03:08:44.288 --> 03:08:45.329]  What do you think, John Rutherford?
[03:08:46.403 --> 03:08:56.211]  I think that people all over the world, Alex, have been waking up at an accelerated rate to the whole rejection of the globalist framework.
[03:08:56.211 --> 03:08:57.672]  And, of course, it takes time.
[03:08:57.672 --> 03:09:02.016]  I mean, it's not like, oh, I snap my fingers and it didn't happen overnight.
[03:09:02.016 --> 03:09:03.277]  Yeah, we were asleep for decades.
[03:09:03.277 --> 03:09:07.500]  I mean, a lot of folks weren't asleep, but the majority were asleep for 50, 60, 70 years.
[03:09:07.500 --> 03:09:10.222]  You're not going to just wake up in 10 seconds.
[03:09:10.222 --> 03:09:10.943]  It's going to take some time.
[03:09:11.894 --> 03:09:20.817]  Yeah, so you've got people in England, you've got people in other countries who are saying, wait a minute now, we don't want to be part of this globalist framework.
[03:09:20.817 --> 03:09:23.518]  We're beginning to see what it actually means.
[03:09:23.518 --> 03:09:27.939]  It isn't just, oh, it's wonderful and peace and cooperation internationally.
[03:09:27.939 --> 03:09:29.379]  That's not it at all.
[03:09:29.379 --> 03:09:34.541]  This is a tyranny over the entire planet to interconnect everything in a robotic way.
[03:09:35.101 --> 03:09:38.185]  Well, people are starting to see that and they don't like it and they don't want it.
[03:09:38.185 --> 03:09:40.208]  They don't want it in their own countries.
[03:09:40.208 --> 03:09:42.050]  So, we are definitely winning.
[03:09:43.223 --> 03:09:47.605]  Now, the globalists thought they were invincible in all their algorithms because humanity was asleep.
[03:09:47.605 --> 03:09:51.987]  As humanity awakens, in the stages of awakening, we were in a deep sleep maybe 10 years ago.
[03:09:51.987 --> 03:09:56.129]  We're kind of awake, getting up, getting a cup of coffee right now in my allegory.
[03:09:56.129 --> 03:09:58.610]  What happens when we actually go to work?
[03:09:58.610 --> 03:10:05.373]  You know, the next year or two, when we walk out the car, the bus, or walk to work, I mean, kind of get awake and get on our hind legs.
[03:10:05.373 --> 03:10:07.954]  I mean, you think that's a good timeline allegory?
[03:10:09.079 --> 03:10:09.620]  You bet.
[03:10:09.620 --> 03:10:13.343]  And I think there's going to be a lot more defections out of Silicon Valley.
[03:10:13.343 --> 03:10:15.505]  Oh, that's a good thing!
[03:10:15.505 --> 03:10:17.446]  I meant to say that a week ago myself.
[03:10:17.446 --> 03:10:24.893]  We're seeing all these top Facebook executives, presidents go out and say, we're dehumanizing, we hurt you, we're sorry, this bad.
[03:10:24.893 --> 03:10:26.314]  Why are they doing that?
[03:10:26.314 --> 03:10:32.219]  Yeah, because, well, I think, you know, in some cases what's happening is they're actually waking up.
[03:10:32.219 --> 03:10:35.682]  They're realizing, hey, this fantasy that we had
[03:10:36.351 --> 03:10:42.535]  You know, about how the information age and the internet was automatically going to take us into utopia.
[03:10:42.535 --> 03:10:43.916]  That was just a fantasy.
[03:10:43.916 --> 03:10:52.662]  You know, that was cooked up on purpose in order to pretend that we were all heading in a great direction rather than into the heart of evil.
[03:10:54.129 --> 03:10:58.493]  And some of those people are waking up, and they don't want to be part of that, and they're talking out.
[03:10:58.493 --> 03:11:02.838]  You know, they realize their careers in Silicon Valley are over.
[03:11:02.838 --> 03:11:05.180]  So, all right, let's tell the truth.
[03:11:05.180 --> 03:11:07.382]  I think we're going to hear a lot more from that area.
[03:11:09.192 --> 03:11:14.478]  Gosh, that's why I love Joan Rappaport, because I think about that with the still of the night when I'm calm, not on air under lights.
[03:11:14.478 --> 03:11:15.719]  I'm like, wow, defections.
[03:11:15.719 --> 03:11:24.568]  Why are all these top execs saying, okay, we were wrong, it's bad, we're dehumanizing you, we preyed on you, we knew it, but we didn't know how bad it would be.
[03:11:24.568 --> 03:11:26.570]  I think they're seeing their own children.
[03:11:26.570 --> 03:11:28.592]  I think they go home and their kid doesn't want to talk to them.
[03:11:28.592 --> 03:11:31.896]  I think they, I mean, I understand this is death.
[03:11:32.967 --> 03:11:39.212]  They do, and you know, there's a tremendous hypocrisy that's becoming schizophrenic up there.
[03:11:39.212 --> 03:11:48.198]  Like these high-tech giants are sending their kids to private schools where there's a rule against having computers and cell phones.
[03:11:48.198 --> 03:11:49.819]  Oh, oh, oh, I'm sorry!
[03:11:49.819 --> 03:11:56.344]  Exactly, that's the kind of... It was Steve Jobs, before he died like seven or eight years ago, said, I don't let my children have iPads!
[03:11:57.308 --> 03:11:58.249]  Right.
[03:11:58.249 --> 03:12:08.780]  You know, so among those people who are just complete hypocrites, there's others who are, you know, waking up and saying, gee, you know, I don't want my kid near any of these devices.
[03:12:08.780 --> 03:12:13.545]  I don't want the mojo on me of billions of souls destroyed.
[03:12:13.545 --> 03:12:14.526]  Exactly.
[03:12:14.526 --> 03:12:18.771]  I mean, there's a thing called righteous guilt, you know, which is not
[03:12:19.306 --> 03:12:22.830]  debilitating fantasy game.
[03:12:22.830 --> 03:12:24.752]  But it's real, you know.
[03:12:24.752 --> 03:12:33.121]  I was part of a machine that's destroying humanity and I don't want to be any part of it and I've got to tell the truth.
[03:12:33.121 --> 03:12:35.363]  We're going to hear a lot more from people like that.
[03:12:35.363 --> 03:12:36.825]  Powerful.
[03:12:36.825 --> 03:12:37.766]  John Rappaport.
[03:12:37.766 --> 03:12:40.329]  Aaron, that's your response to what you said.
[03:12:40.329 --> 03:12:40.989]  You're on target.
[03:12:40.989 --> 03:12:41.210]  Go ahead.
[03:12:42.717 --> 03:12:47.881]  And my other thing is I've been trying to reach out for years on YouTube, BigHickory357.
[03:12:47.881 --> 03:12:52.324]  I'm also on Facebook, BigHickory357.
[03:12:52.324 --> 03:13:02.490]  And when you were talking with Mark about people losing their jobs, I lost my job from my January 1st, 2015 video.
[03:13:02.490 --> 03:13:05.773]  And so I've been trying to get it out.
[03:13:05.773 --> 03:13:09.295]  I share your videos actually on my website, BigHickory357.com.
[03:13:11.855 --> 03:13:14.159]  I even have a link to y'all's site.
[03:13:27.338 --> 03:13:29.439]  It wasn't a real movie, but it's an archetype.
[03:13:29.439 --> 03:13:34.420]  John Wayne with the four guys with guns, and they say it's a lot of talk for a fat man, a one-eyed fat man.
[03:13:34.420 --> 03:13:37.941]  At a certain point, man, it's empowering to just say, fill your hand, let's go.
[03:13:37.941 --> 03:13:41.982]  And I think we've reached that point where humanity's tired of being bullied, God bless you.
[03:13:41.982 --> 03:13:45.503]  Kenyon in Ohio, real fast, thanks for holding, you're awesome.
[03:13:45.503 --> 03:13:46.203]  Thanks for joining us.
[03:13:46.203 --> 03:13:48.384]  You're on the air with John Rappaport.
[03:13:48.384 --> 03:13:52.845]  Yeah, I'd just like to give a shout-out to my cousin in California, Evan, and my grandpa.
[03:13:52.845 --> 03:13:54.225]  Awesome.
[03:13:54.225 --> 03:13:55.586]  Well, say hi to Grandpa.
[03:13:55.586 --> 03:13:56.306]  What's Grandpa's name?
[03:13:57.690 --> 03:13:58.811]  His name's Arnold.
[03:13:58.811 --> 03:14:02.493]  He's Arnold Kenyon Westman I, and I'm III, so.
[03:14:02.493 --> 03:14:03.634]  Awesome.
[03:14:03.634 --> 03:14:06.056]  He's watching right now, actually.
[03:14:06.056 --> 03:14:18.264]  Oh, anyway, with the net neutrality, I don't know if you realize this, but there was a first iteration of that in 2005, I think, and I remember reading it, and I don't know if people read the bills of these things or the license agreements for these companies.
[03:14:18.264 --> 03:14:18.524]  We try.
[03:14:18.524 --> 03:14:19.965]  It's just ridiculous.
[03:14:19.965 --> 03:14:24.408]  And the reason why I think that it's becoming so pertinent now is with the cryptocurrencies.
[03:14:25.131 --> 03:14:37.597]  As the aggregation gets larger for the cryptocurrencies, those companies that say can rate the cost of the service that they're giving, essentially could be the ones that mediate a market if bitcoins go global like they are now.
[03:14:39.079 --> 03:14:42.961]  With information being as it is, being sold and bought, it's like it's a battle between the two.
[03:14:42.961 --> 03:14:46.702]  Like, I'm going to provide the content, but I don't have to pay for you to use my super servers.
[03:14:46.702 --> 03:14:49.283]  But I have all the computation on this end, and you have all the bandwidth on this end.
[03:14:49.283 --> 03:14:49.944]  That's what I'm saying.
[03:14:49.944 --> 03:14:54.365]  It's really a battle over the future, not Obama gave us neutrality, he's taking it.
[03:14:54.365 --> 03:14:56.626]  That's just dumbing it down.
[03:14:56.626 --> 03:14:57.347]  That's hogwash.
[03:14:57.347 --> 03:15:00.568]  It was hogwash from the first portions of that bill.
[03:15:01.289 --> 03:15:09.533]  But I think that if you've read about the global amount of energy that cryptocurrencies consume, it's going to become a real problem as far as bandwidth goes.
[03:15:09.533 --> 03:15:11.654]  And those companies, I think, are going to be trying to take advantage of that.
[03:15:11.654 --> 03:15:12.514]  Wow, smart guy.
[03:15:12.514 --> 03:15:13.955]  We'll call us back about that.
[03:15:13.955 --> 03:15:15.516]  I'm punching out, not because I don't want to be here.
[03:15:15.516 --> 03:15:16.756]  I don't want to run over John Rappaport.
[03:15:16.756 --> 03:15:18.117]  Straight ahead, John Rappaport.

[03:16:47.678 --> 03:16:50.059]  And it doesn't sing when you open it.

[03:20:11.110 --> 03:20:14.613]  John Rappaport here, sitting in for Alex in the fourth hour, InfoWars.
[03:20:14.613 --> 03:20:22.099]  Just want to reiterate what Alex was saying about Christmas savings at InfoWarsStore.com.

[03:20:47.027 --> 03:20:52.089]  I don't know, why do you need to go to the mall and start looking around for
[03:20:53.146 --> 03:20:59.010]  Crazy stuff and spend gigantic amounts of money when it's right there at InfoWarsStore.com.

[03:21:07.117 --> 03:21:13.361]  Massive Christmas savings at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:21:13.361 --> 03:21:15.143]  So I return to my
[03:21:17.344 --> 03:21:18.925]  Shall I say favorite subject?
[03:21:18.925 --> 03:21:23.869]  I don't know if that's really the word for it, but it's the medical cartel.
[03:21:23.869 --> 03:21:27.371]  Why do I keep harping upon the medical cartel?
[03:21:27.371 --> 03:21:32.094]  Why do I keep delivering you fact after fact after fact?
[03:21:32.094 --> 03:21:40.360]  Because the medical cartel is one of the great action arms of globalism, meaning
[03:21:41.389 --> 03:21:58.727]  You can't subdue an entire planet and put it under one system unless you subdue and pacify and toxify and debilitate and weaken the billions of people on the planet.
[03:21:58.727 --> 03:22:00.209]  That's the deal, folks.
[03:22:01.363 --> 03:22:10.110]  It's very hard for some people to accept or to see because their view of the medical cartel is that it's all wonderful and all saves lives and so forth.
[03:22:10.110 --> 03:22:22.439]  And yeah, there are really good doctors, especially emergency crisis doctors that can put people back together again in an acute crisis situation, but that is the cover
[03:22:23.308 --> 03:22:36.397]  That's what's being parlayed into the false assertion that the entire medical cartel is doing the same kind of good work and nothing could be further from the truth.
[03:22:36.397 --> 03:22:41.440]  No, it's an arm of globalism.
[03:22:41.440 --> 03:22:49.326]  106,000 people, conservative estimate, killed by FDA-approved pharmaceuticals in the U.S.
[03:22:49.326 --> 03:22:50.006]  every year.
[03:22:50.006 --> 03:22:52.508]  That's a million per decade.
[03:22:53.522 --> 03:22:56.403]  A million per decade.
[03:22:56.403 --> 03:23:00.345]  We had a smallpox revelation recently.
[03:23:00.345 --> 03:23:05.048]  The FDA made an announcement about a case that it's pursuing.
[03:23:05.048 --> 03:23:15.833]  And in the middle of the announcement, it said, the smallpox vaccine should not be given to people whose immune systems are weak.
[03:23:15.833 --> 03:23:22.056]  That's like one of those gems that stands out in the middle of the night sky and reveals the truth.
[03:23:22.805 --> 03:23:23.205]  Why?
[03:23:23.205 --> 03:23:27.226]  And I hope there's a whole lot of people listening in Africa right now.
[03:23:27.226 --> 03:23:44.989]  Hope there's a whole lot of people because between the years 1966 and 1980 in Africa, a hundred million shots of smallpox vaccine were delivered on that continent.
[03:23:44.989 --> 03:23:52.451]  And millions and millions of those people who got that shot happened to have weakened immune system.
[03:23:53.709 --> 03:23:55.230]  What does that mean?
[03:23:55.230 --> 03:24:07.555]  That means that the vaccine causes smallpox in those people, or destroys their lives through other kinds of damage, or kills them outright.
[03:24:07.555 --> 03:24:21.982]  And yet, in 1980, the United Nations and the World Health Organization popped the corks on the champagne and celebrated the elimination of smallpox in the third world and said that this was the greatest medical triumph in history.
[03:24:24.161 --> 03:24:27.902]  You get what I'm talking about here?
[03:24:27.902 --> 03:24:32.243]  These are the kinds of deceptions that I'm talking about.
[03:24:32.243 --> 03:24:34.304]  All the medical experts agree.
[03:24:34.304 --> 03:24:40.466]  Do not give this vaccine to anybody whose immune system is weak.
[03:24:40.466 --> 03:24:50.409]  Over here, 14 years of giving millions and millions and millions of shots in Africa to people whose immune systems are weak.
[03:24:53.010 --> 03:25:21.103]  Now I happen to know, because I had a very credible source, molecular biologists tell me that after the so-called celebration of eliminating smallpox in Africa in 1980, there was a super-secret meeting in Geneva of the World Health Organization, at which it was decided they would never use this vaccine again.
[03:25:23.456 --> 03:25:24.996]  And I said to my source, why?
[03:25:24.996 --> 03:25:29.037]  And he said, because it caused smallpox.
[03:25:29.037 --> 03:25:31.078]  Get it?
[03:25:31.078 --> 03:25:35.539]  It caused smallpox.
[03:25:35.539 --> 03:25:38.139]  Now, you're not getting that on the evening news.
[03:25:38.139 --> 03:25:40.040]  You're not getting that on the mainstream news.
[03:25:40.040 --> 03:25:43.261]  You're getting that right here.
[03:25:43.261 --> 03:25:48.902]  You're getting the deeper truth right here.
[03:25:48.902 --> 03:25:49.122]  Now,
[03:25:50.976 --> 03:25:53.739]  You could say, oh well they made a mistake in Africa.
[03:25:53.739 --> 03:25:59.645]  You know, it's just one of those things that happens, bureaucratic confusion and whatever.
[03:25:59.645 --> 03:26:07.353]  You know, I have to say I'm sick and tired of people who keep making excuses for these murderers.
[03:26:07.353 --> 03:26:11.537]  It's way beyond the time of making excuses.
[03:26:11.537 --> 03:26:12.018]  They knew.
[03:26:13.408 --> 03:26:14.549]  Understand?
[03:26:14.549 --> 03:26:23.896]  They knew very well that giving this vaccine to people whose immune systems were already weak would push them over the edge and destroy their lives.
[03:26:23.896 --> 03:26:26.618]  They knew that at the outset in 1966.
[03:26:26.618 --> 03:26:29.621]  They knew it in 1980.
[03:26:29.621 --> 03:26:32.203]  They know it now.
[03:26:32.203 --> 03:26:41.390]  There's no... It's not like you and I have this incredibly arcane knowledge that is not shared by... No!
[03:26:43.399 --> 03:26:53.547]  This is an open source piece of information that was known and is known to doctors all over the world.
[03:26:53.547 --> 03:26:58.331]  And yet they went ahead with that vaccination campaign.
[03:26:58.331 --> 03:26:59.312]  What does that tell you?
[03:26:59.312 --> 03:27:02.194]  That's called a clue.
[03:27:02.194 --> 03:27:07.018]  You can't have it both ways, my friends.
[03:27:07.018 --> 03:27:11.822]  You can't say they knew, but, you know, it was a mistake.
[03:27:11.822 --> 03:27:11.962]  No.
[03:27:12.984 --> 03:27:17.026]  If they knew, they did it on purpose.
[03:27:17.026 --> 03:27:29.051]  If you know the effect of something you're going to do is horrendous on the people you're going to do it to, and you do it anyway, then you know.
[03:27:29.051 --> 03:27:30.832]  You know in advance.
[03:27:30.832 --> 03:27:32.072]  And what does that mean?
[03:27:32.072 --> 03:27:36.174]  That means you want to create that.
[03:27:36.937 --> 03:27:40.700]  Horrendous outcome to people that you're doing it to.
[03:27:40.700 --> 03:27:46.084]  There is no other way around it.
[03:27:46.084 --> 03:27:48.866]  And we have to face up to that.
[03:27:48.866 --> 03:28:00.855]  Because you can't just expose all of this information that I've been doing, say, for the last 35 years and then say, well, I'm going to leave intent out of the equation.
[03:28:00.855 --> 03:28:02.516]  I'm not going to be talking about that.
[03:28:02.516 --> 03:28:04.417]  We don't want to get into those deep waters.
[03:28:04.417 --> 03:28:04.958]  No, you have to.
[03:28:07.984 --> 03:28:08.706]  There's a lot more.
[03:28:08.706 --> 03:28:11.675]  We'll be back with your 4th hour eventually.
[03:28:34.864 --> 03:28:37.485]  Most people think life insurance pays after you're dead.
[03:28:37.485 --> 03:28:38.505]  That's true.
[03:28:38.505 --> 03:28:43.566]  But did you know you can have tax-free access to your life insurance while you're still alive?
[03:28:43.566 --> 03:28:48.767]  You can use the life benefits of your life insurance to grow your money with certainty and guarantees.

[03:28:56.769 --> 03:28:57.049]  Call 702-660-7000.

[03:29:04.713 --> 03:29:07.754]  Want revenge on the common housefly?
[03:29:07.754 --> 03:29:11.735]  Well, after 10,000 years, someone has finally come up with a better way.

[03:34:02.013 --> 03:34:05.554]  What a concept, the truth.
[03:34:05.554 --> 03:34:07.615]  So we're talking about the medical cartel here.
[03:34:07.615 --> 03:34:17.360]  Let me give you a couple of current stories that are not getting the coverage that they should get.
[03:34:18.246 --> 03:34:26.412]  Sanofi, a gigantic pharmaceutical company, is having some problems in the Philippines.
[03:34:26.412 --> 03:34:35.099]  Now, I wish that people in the federal government here would pay attention because something's happening down there.
[03:34:35.099 --> 03:34:46.407]  Actually, the government officials are in an uproar because of a vaccine campaign using Sanofi's vaccine against
[03:34:47.196 --> 03:34:49.578]  Dengue fever, okay?
[03:34:49.578 --> 03:34:54.742]  Thousands of kids have already been vaccinated in the Philippines.
[03:34:54.742 --> 03:35:00.806]  And all of a sudden, through an uproar in the federal government, the program is stopped.
[03:35:00.806 --> 03:35:05.990]  The vaccine campaign is stopped in its tracks.
[03:35:05.990 --> 03:35:06.810]  Why?
[03:35:06.810 --> 03:35:16.077]  Because somebody in the government, health ministry, figured out that Sanofi itself, the manufacturer,
[03:35:16.952 --> 03:35:38.128]  said, although they wouldn't want to repeat it now, this vaccine can be dangerous, might be dangerous to children who, quote, haven't contacted the dengue virus before.
[03:35:38.128 --> 03:35:42.712]  Here's an admission from the manufacturer.
[03:35:42.712 --> 03:35:44.733]  And then
[03:35:46.204 --> 03:36:05.189]  In the federal government of the Philippines, their own experts, I mean mainstream experts, were warning them before they started this massive dengue fever vaccine campaign to watch out, not to do it because the safety and efficacy of the vaccine had not yet been proven.
[03:36:05.189 --> 03:36:07.590]  But they went ahead anyway.
[03:36:07.590 --> 03:36:10.571]  And now they're paying the price.
[03:36:10.571 --> 03:36:13.972]  And the campaign has been stopped.
[03:36:13.972 --> 03:36:15.212]  Stopped in its tracks.
[03:36:17.876 --> 03:36:20.917]  That's an example that the U.S.
[03:36:20.917 --> 03:36:23.578]  and other countries ought to follow.
[03:36:23.578 --> 03:36:25.559]  Why can't they follow that?
[03:36:25.559 --> 03:36:36.042]  Why can't one of these senators, or a whole bunch of these people, get up on their hind legs and say, Stop!
[03:36:36.042 --> 03:36:37.503]  No more!
[03:36:37.503 --> 03:36:44.225]  We want an investigation of the vaccine safety situation!
[03:36:47.321 --> 03:36:49.922]  You understand what I'm saying here?
[03:36:49.922 --> 03:36:55.504]  Trump hinted at it when he was elected during the campaign.
[03:36:55.504 --> 03:37:08.509]  He said, yes, it makes sense to see and assume there's a connection between giving vaccines and kids getting autism.
[03:37:08.509 --> 03:37:14.211]  He was not the only one that said it during the campaign, if you remember that Republican debate.
[03:37:14.211 --> 03:37:14.651]  Okay.
[03:37:14.651 --> 03:37:14.691]  So.
[03:37:18.010 --> 03:37:27.414]  Those people and us can just sit here and say, well, I wonder when he's going to launch the investigation.
[03:37:27.414 --> 03:37:32.136]  Well, maybe it's going to be never.
[03:37:32.136 --> 03:37:33.337]  Maybe it's up to us.
[03:37:34.238 --> 03:37:57.371]  To present the truth loudly enough, because we're not just talking about a scientific issue here, we're talking about the destruction of human life in this country and all over the planet through the delivery of toxic elements in these vaccines like mercury, aluminum, formaldehyde, injected into children, injected into babies.
[03:37:57.371 --> 03:37:58.332]  Never had
[03:37:59.384 --> 03:38:20.295]  A study, a really well done study comparing the vaccinated and the unvaccinated in a mainstream setting to validate all of the BS claims of the Centers for Disease Control and everybody else that, oh, these things are marvelously safe and effective.
[03:38:20.295 --> 03:38:20.996]  Yeah, really?
[03:38:20.996 --> 03:38:24.017]  Is that right?
[03:38:24.017 --> 03:38:28.500]  So why did they suddenly stop this massive vaccine campaign in the Philippines?
[03:38:29.233 --> 03:38:34.235]  And now everybody's looking at everybody with egg on their face and saying, well, what do we do now?
[03:38:34.235 --> 03:38:37.295]  Yeah, well, what you do now is you look at what's in the vaccine.
[03:38:37.295 --> 03:38:41.957]  OK, guys down there in the Philippines, we have any listeners down there?
[03:38:41.957 --> 03:38:44.198]  I'm sure we do.
[03:38:44.198 --> 03:38:46.358]  Look at what's in the vaccine.
[03:38:46.358 --> 03:38:48.759]  Look at the toxic elements and the chemicals.
[03:38:49.885 --> 03:39:00.034]  Send it out to independent labs to analyze the extraneous contamination and germs that are not supposed to be in the vaccine that are there.
[03:39:00.034 --> 03:39:00.695]  Let's go!
[03:39:00.695 --> 03:39:04.418]  If you're gonna go, go all the way.
[03:39:04.418 --> 03:39:16.029]  The medical cartel is in the business of destroying human life and debilitating the brain and the mind for a very good reason.
[03:39:17.782 --> 03:39:25.086]  As I keep saying, because I want to put this in front of you so there's no mistake about what I'm talking about here.
[03:39:25.086 --> 03:39:41.916]  If you want to run a planet by a top-down tyranny, aka globalism, you have got to confuse, destroy, weaken, debilitate, pacify billions of people in order to make that happen.
[03:39:42.626 --> 03:39:50.908]  And how can you do that by waging a covert chemical war against the entire population, a.k.a.
[03:39:50.908 --> 03:39:55.389]  toxic vaccines and toxic medical drugs?
[03:39:55.389 --> 03:40:02.031]  That is, in fact, what's happening and has been happening for a very long time.
[03:40:02.031 --> 03:40:05.611]  Absolutely true.
[03:40:05.611 --> 03:40:07.872]  Here's another piece to the puzzle.
[03:40:10.089 --> 03:40:25.319]  All of a sudden, out of Australia and other places comes the news, you know, the flu vaccine this year is really only about 10% effective.
[03:40:25.319 --> 03:40:29.943]  This is mainstream news now, admitting this out in the open.
[03:40:29.943 --> 03:40:36.367]  This is if you accept the whole theory of what vaccines do and so forth and so on, which I don't, but
[03:40:37.066 --> 03:40:40.128]  Even then, they're admitting only 10% effective.
[03:40:40.128 --> 03:40:40.788]  Why?
[03:40:40.788 --> 03:40:44.130]  Well, there's a new study and everybody's climbing on board.
[03:40:44.130 --> 03:40:48.672]  Well, it turns out, you see, they make the flu vaccine with chicken eggs.
[03:40:48.672 --> 03:40:56.736]  And when you put the flu virus into the vaccine, into the chicken eggs, it mutates.
[03:40:56.736 --> 03:41:05.260]  And so what the vaccine is actually delivering is not the flu virus of the season that we are seeing.
[03:41:06.576 --> 03:41:15.980]  But some mutated form with who knows what effect, but it certainly isn't the effect of immunizing anybody.
[03:41:15.980 --> 03:41:17.520]  Wow!
[03:41:17.520 --> 03:41:22.362]  Why is that page one headlines on the Today Show?
[03:41:22.362 --> 03:41:35.467]  You're not getting that on the CBS Evening News as the lead story with a pledge from some pretty boy anchor that we are going to dig into this and look into it, investigate it, and so on and so forth.
[03:41:36.997 --> 03:41:39.959]  Because I'll give you a clue.
[03:41:39.959 --> 03:41:50.386]  Chicken eggs used to make vaccines, and they're saying that this year, very low effectiveness of the vaccine, only 10%.
[03:41:50.386 --> 03:41:52.387]  Really?
[03:41:52.387 --> 03:41:52.828]  Really?
[03:41:52.828 --> 03:41:54.989]  This year?
[03:41:54.989 --> 03:41:56.630]  Guess what?
[03:41:56.630 --> 03:42:02.154]  Chicken eggs have been used to make vaccines for, wait for it, 70 years.
[03:42:05.369 --> 03:42:06.850]  70 years.
[03:42:06.850 --> 03:42:10.411]  Think about that cover-up.
[03:42:10.411 --> 03:42:13.292]  How long has this been going on?
[03:42:13.292 --> 03:42:18.013]  Well, at least 70 years.
[03:42:18.013 --> 03:42:19.934]  Okay.
[03:42:19.934 --> 03:42:20.734]  We've got more.
[03:42:20.734 --> 03:42:25.096]  John Mappaport here in the fourth hour for Alex.
[03:42:25.096 --> 03:42:25.756]  Stay with us.
[03:42:25.756 --> 03:42:26.296]  We'll be back.
[03:42:36.935 --> 03:42:39.914]  You heard it here first, and the globalists are already dreading it.
[03:42:40.805 --> 03:42:46.486]  It's the first annual Christmas Spectacular Extravaganza brought to you by InfoWars.
[03:42:46.486 --> 03:42:49.767]  And it's launching Christmas week, leading into Christmas.
[03:42:49.767 --> 03:42:52.287]  You know, Christmas is about Christmas.

[03:43:35.891 --> 03:43:38.433]  Matt in Ohio, you're on the air, another Matt, go ahead.
[03:43:38.433 --> 03:43:53.022]  Yeah, hey, listen, I just wanted to say real quick, I'm a long-time listener of InfoWars, and I just wanted to say that the t-shirts that you guys are offering are absolutely fantastic, and that really is a great way to deal with this battle in the InfoWars.
[03:43:53.022 --> 03:44:00.607]  It might seem like a simple thing, but particularly these slogan t-shirts that you guys got up right now are absolutely amazing.
[03:44:01.147 --> 03:44:06.050]  My favorite new one is the Don't Tread On Me, but instead it says Won't Tread On Me.
[03:44:06.050 --> 03:44:09.012]  And it's a big Dayglo snake, Gadsden snake.
[03:44:09.012 --> 03:44:12.294]  And then it's got the American flag, Infowars.com on the right arm.
[03:44:12.294 --> 03:44:18.537]  I mean, that's a great way just to meet like-minded people and spread the word and also exercise free speech.
[03:44:18.537 --> 03:44:20.959]  And the newest one is Trigger Warning T-shirt.
[03:44:21.679 --> 03:44:28.540]  Trigger warning t-shirt, which is the symbol of a trigger, with a yield sign and then InfoWars.com on the back.
[03:44:28.540 --> 03:44:38.843]  That is the new Shirt of the Month, available exclusively at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:44:38.843 --> 03:44:43.504]  Proper B vitamin intake is essential to keep the body functioning at optimum levels.
[03:44:43.504 --> 03:44:45.024]  Op-op-op-op-optimum levels.
[03:44:46.087 --> 03:44:50.750]  With our modern diets, it can be hard to get the recommended amount of B vitamins we need every day.
[03:44:50.750 --> 03:44:53.071]  O-O-O-Optimum levels.
[03:44:53.071 --> 03:44:54.852]  B vitamins we need every day.
[03:44:54.852 --> 03:45:00.115]  Secret 12 combines two bioactive forms of vitamin B12 for optimal absorption.
[03:45:00.115 --> 03:45:02.436]  O-O-O-O-Optimal absorption.
[03:45:02.436 --> 03:45:08.099]  Being deficient in B vitamins can cause fatigue, depression, poor memory, and lethargy.
[03:45:08.099 --> 03:45:08.479]  Secret 12.
[03:45:08.479 --> 03:45:09.260]  O-O-O-O-Optimum levels.
[03:45:09.620 --> 03:45:09.940]  I think so.
[03:45:35.209 --> 03:45:37.090]  You developed Living Defense for us.
[03:45:37.090 --> 03:45:38.411]  It took you over a year to do it.
[03:45:38.411 --> 03:45:39.612]  Why is this so good?
[03:45:39.612 --> 03:45:44.895]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[03:45:44.895 --> 03:45:58.443]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[03:45:58.443 --> 03:45:59.804]  Right now with all the refugees,
[03:46:00.584 --> 03:46:02.225]  Uh, spreading disease around.
[03:46:02.225 --> 03:46:04.806]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[03:46:04.806 --> 03:46:06.107]  These are all parasites.
[03:46:06.107 --> 03:46:07.207]  Tell us about all the stuff that's in it.
[03:46:07.207 --> 03:46:08.548]  There's so many things that are in it.
[03:46:08.548 --> 03:46:13.050]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bug, the organic wormwood.
[03:46:13.050 --> 03:46:16.191]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[03:46:16.311 --> 03:46:19.373]  All right, well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[03:46:19.373 --> 03:46:20.434]  It just came back in yesterday.
[03:46:20.434 --> 03:46:22.356]  Living Defense, Infowarslife.com.
[03:46:22.356 --> 03:46:23.396]  And folks, you can't lose.
[03:46:23.396 --> 03:46:26.058]  It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[03:46:26.058 --> 03:46:29.361]  And you support the broadcast, Infowarslife.com.
[03:46:29.361 --> 03:46:31.602]  Thank you, Dr. Group from the Global Healing Center.
[03:46:31.602 --> 03:46:37.447]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[03:46:37.447 --> 03:46:40.089]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:46:59.890 --> 03:47:15.880]  John Rappaport here in the last segment, fourth hour, sitting in for Alex, talking about globalist destruction of human life and how you're getting the actual news here, you're not getting it in mainstream news.
[03:47:15.880 --> 03:47:17.681]  Mainstream news is paralyzed.
[03:47:17.681 --> 03:47:25.346]  They can't tell you about this because they are in partnership with medical cartel.
[03:47:25.346 --> 03:47:27.087]  Not only are they being sponsored,
[03:47:30.059 --> 03:47:37.705]  3.2 billion dollars spent so far in 2017 by pharmaceutical companies.
[03:47:37.705 --> 03:47:42.808]  3.2 billion dollars on TV ads.
[03:47:42.808 --> 03:47:44.850]  Just TV ads, right?
[03:47:47.643 --> 03:47:51.447]  Gee, I wonder if there's any pharmaceutical control over the news.
[03:47:51.447 --> 03:48:01.677]  So just imagine that if on the NBC Nightly News, what I've been talking about here for the last 40 minutes or so, were highlighted as the main lead story.
[03:48:02.668 --> 03:48:15.054]  With the promise that we've got our hounds, our reporters out there, folks, and we're digging into this, what's happening with the troubling stories about vaccines destroying life and medical drugs destroying life.
[03:48:15.054 --> 03:48:26.839]  And we're not going to stop until we get to the bottom of this and what's really going on, because we know that they know what they're doing when they destroy human life.
[03:48:26.839 --> 03:48:30.321]  And you can be sure that we will stay on the story.
[03:48:31.198 --> 03:48:39.484]  Well, the next day, everybody in that newsroom would be fired, blackballed for the rest of their lives.
[03:48:39.484 --> 03:48:53.273]  Pharmaceutical companies would suddenly withdraw maybe $50 million worth of advertising overnight from that giant network just to show them the power of what they can do.
[03:48:53.273 --> 03:48:54.894]  And everybody would capitulate.
[03:48:54.894 --> 03:48:56.895]  We'll never do anything like that again.
[03:48:56.895 --> 03:48:59.117]  That was just somebody once psychotic.
[03:48:59.117 --> 03:48:59.917]  I'm sorry.
[03:48:59.917 --> 03:49:00.838]  You know.
[03:49:03.450 --> 03:49:07.112]  But we don't have that problem here.
[03:49:07.112 --> 03:49:07.992]  We don't have that problem.
[03:49:07.992 --> 03:49:12.434]  We expose the psychotics.
[03:49:12.434 --> 03:49:13.874]  We expose the psychotics.
[03:49:13.874 --> 03:49:19.697]  For example, all this business about students being triggered,
[03:49:20.530 --> 03:49:28.473]  At universities, this epidemic of so-called, whatever, safe space.
[03:49:28.473 --> 03:49:38.277]  I've got to have my safe space because any word you say, any gesture you make, any move could trigger me and put me into a state of
[03:49:39.177 --> 03:49:40.298]  Horror!
[03:49:40.298 --> 03:49:59.811]  Therefore, I must have my hot chocolate, and I must sit in a little kiddie room and play with toys, and I can't listen to certain ideas, and my teachers have to warn me, issue a trigger warning, and blah blah blah, whenever they're going to say anything, pretty much, right?
[03:49:59.811 --> 03:50:03.753]  Where do you think all that came from?
[03:50:03.753 --> 03:50:05.895]  Some months ago, I exposed the fact
[03:50:08.092 --> 03:50:09.053]  That on U.S.
[03:50:09.053 --> 03:50:27.481]  college campuses, 25%, okay listen to this, 25% of students in the last year received a diagnosis of a mental disorder or were being treated with drugs for a mental disorder.
[03:50:27.481 --> 03:50:28.182]  25%.
[03:50:28.182 --> 03:50:37.226]  So if you send your kids to college in this country, you're pretty much sending them to a psychiatric clinic where they will be diagnosed with a mental disorder.
[03:50:38.926 --> 03:50:41.031]  And then prescribed toxic.
[03:50:41.804 --> 03:50:43.786]  brain scrambling drugs.
[03:50:43.786 --> 03:50:45.507]  I've documented this for years.
[03:50:45.507 --> 03:50:55.294]  The anti-depressants, the anti-psychotic drugs which are more and more being used for ordinary people with ordinary problems.
[03:50:55.294 --> 03:51:09.125]  The speed type drugs for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder where speed crash happens and then depression and then anti-depressants are prescribed and then up and down and then
[03:51:09.665 --> 03:51:13.708]  Bipolar is diagnosed and then heavier drugs are given.
[03:51:13.708 --> 03:51:21.012]  Yeah, these kids are being driven insane by psychiatrists.
[03:51:21.012 --> 03:51:25.174]  And then you hear all this, I could be triggered by anything.
[03:51:25.174 --> 03:51:27.196]  Yeah, sure.
[03:51:27.196 --> 03:51:30.218]  Some of it is completely made up and ridiculous.
[03:51:30.218 --> 03:51:31.758]  Yes, yes.
[03:51:31.758 --> 03:51:35.761]  But there's some of it that is coming from being poisoned
[03:51:37.393 --> 03:51:53.226]  And brain assaulted by psychiatric drugs on college campuses because it's now, the American university and college system is now a giant psychiatric industry outpost.
[03:51:53.226 --> 03:51:55.208]  Understand that.
[03:51:55.208 --> 03:52:00.132]  Things are not like they used to be, folks.
[03:52:00.132 --> 03:52:01.373]  I know it takes a stretch.
[03:52:02.586 --> 03:52:04.888]  Takes a stretch for me too at first.
[03:52:04.888 --> 03:52:06.529]  I know, this couldn't be.
[03:52:06.529 --> 03:52:08.630]  You mean this is happening now?
[03:52:08.630 --> 03:52:09.511]  How could that be?
[03:52:09.511 --> 03:52:11.492]  It wasn't happening when I was growing up.
[03:52:11.492 --> 03:52:13.414]  No, it wasn't.
[03:52:13.414 --> 03:52:16.536]  But the globalists are changing things.
[03:52:16.536 --> 03:52:21.499]  And this thing that I'm talking about on a college campus, is this being done on purpose?
[03:52:21.499 --> 03:52:25.002]  The psychiatrists know the effects of these drugs.
[03:52:26.357 --> 03:52:28.818]  They are not in the dark about it.
[03:52:28.818 --> 03:52:38.203]  The pharmaceutical companies that make the horrendous psychiatric drugs know about the effects of these drugs on the brain.
[03:52:38.203 --> 03:52:44.326]  They are not in the dark either and they keep doing it.
[03:52:44.326 --> 03:52:45.827]  Don't let them off the hook.
[03:52:46.488 --> 03:52:57.116]  Don't say, we are the privileged few who know the truth, and these poor psychiatrists, they just haven't been let in on the story yet.
[03:52:57.116 --> 03:52:58.557]  Come on.
[03:52:58.557 --> 03:53:00.558]  Come on, wise up.
[03:53:00.558 --> 03:53:03.741]  They know, and they're doing it anyway.
[03:53:03.741 --> 03:53:06.002]  They're poisoning your children.
[03:53:06.002 --> 03:53:07.603]  Straight out.
[03:53:07.603 --> 03:53:09.885]  Straight into the brain.
[03:53:09.885 --> 03:53:11.066]  Brain poison.
[03:53:13.200 --> 03:53:24.283]  That's the way it's being done on college campuses and in society in general, but particularly 25 percent, one out of four.
[03:53:24.283 --> 03:53:25.683]  I mean, can you imagine?
[03:53:25.683 --> 03:53:31.965]  Kids are bouncing off the walls at these places.
[03:53:31.965 --> 03:53:34.805]  And how does this all start?
[03:53:34.805 --> 03:53:36.486]  This has been documented.
[03:53:36.486 --> 03:53:37.886]  The stories have been told.
[03:53:38.869 --> 03:53:42.513]  I've been looking into this for a very long time as a reporter.
[03:53:42.513 --> 03:53:45.456]  A kid starts out with a problem at college.
[03:53:45.456 --> 03:53:47.298]  Can't study.
[03:53:47.298 --> 03:53:49.140]  What's going on with all these courses?
[03:53:49.140 --> 03:53:51.603]  I've never had so much homework in my life.
[03:53:51.603 --> 03:53:53.004]  I don't know what to do.
[03:53:53.004 --> 03:53:54.826]  What major shall I choose?
[03:53:54.826 --> 03:53:58.210]  How do I approach the opposite sex?
[03:53:59.113 --> 03:54:04.196]  And date, and this and that, and what about social relationships in the dorm?
[03:54:04.196 --> 03:54:14.383]  And, you know, okay, kid gets a little bit overwhelmed, doesn't know what to do, goes to see somebody in the counseling office.
[03:54:14.383 --> 03:54:27.672]  At one time, there would be a conversation, there would be a little bit of help perhaps, you know, some tutoring, whatever, orientation that this is, you know, what college is all about, and whatever, whatever.
[03:54:28.564 --> 03:54:29.204]  Advice?
[03:54:29.204 --> 03:54:31.345]  No, now it's like, boom!
[03:54:31.345 --> 03:54:32.986]  Referral to a psychiatrist.
[03:54:32.986 --> 03:54:35.067]  Prescription written.
[03:54:35.067 --> 03:54:39.869]  Diagnosis of a mental disorder made.
[03:54:39.869 --> 03:54:42.650]  Drugs, drugs, drugs, drugs.
[03:54:42.650 --> 03:54:44.550]  Chemical warfare.
[03:54:44.550 --> 03:54:47.051]  That's what it is, folks.
[03:54:47.051 --> 03:54:50.273]  The drugs are chemical warfare.
[03:54:50.273 --> 03:54:52.274]  Straight out.
[03:54:52.274 --> 03:54:54.374]  Part of the plan.
[03:54:54.374 --> 03:54:55.875]  Absolutely part of the plan.
[03:54:56.542 --> 03:54:58.242]  Want to destroy a country?
[03:54:58.242 --> 03:55:00.783]  Destroy the young.
[03:55:00.783 --> 03:55:04.104]  These people will never be the same.
[03:55:04.104 --> 03:55:04.784]  Think about that.
[03:55:04.784 --> 03:55:17.587]  These students, they get out of college, they've been diagnosed with one or two mental disorders, they've been on drugs constantly, debilitating, brain scrambling drugs.
[03:55:17.587 --> 03:55:21.588]  You think when they graduate all of a sudden they're just going to say, hooray!
[03:55:22.475 --> 03:55:24.436]  I'm now free of all that.
[03:55:24.436 --> 03:55:24.997]  No!
[03:55:24.997 --> 03:55:33.962]  They're going to go through their whole lives, both psychologically and chemically dependent.
[03:55:33.962 --> 03:55:35.082]  Want to destroy a country?
[03:55:35.082 --> 03:55:38.244]  You destroy the young.
[03:55:38.244 --> 03:55:45.809]  So it may interest you to know, and again, I've documented this six ways from Sunday over the years,
[03:55:47.094 --> 03:56:05.123]  That in the Bible of the psychiatric profession, called the DSM, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, published by the American Psychiatric Association, with new updated editions every few years, right?
[03:56:05.123 --> 03:56:12.446]  They list all of the supposed official psychiatric mental disorders.
[03:56:12.446 --> 03:56:14.907]  At last count, there were roughly 300 of them.
[03:56:17.176 --> 03:56:17.977]  Really?
[03:56:17.977 --> 03:56:21.843]  300 different mental disorders?
[03:56:21.843 --> 03:56:24.927]  Are you kidding?
[03:56:24.927 --> 03:56:33.199]  In not one of these cases, is there a defining diagnostic test?
[03:56:34.742 --> 03:56:49.228]  For none of the listed so-called mental disorders, is there a defining diagnostic test like a brain scan, a genetic assay, a blood test, a urine test, a hair test?
[03:56:49.228 --> 03:56:50.549]  Nothing.
[03:56:50.549 --> 03:56:51.629]  Zero.
[03:56:51.629 --> 03:56:55.311]  If you don't believe me, be my guest.
[03:56:55.311 --> 03:56:58.593]  Read it and weep.
[03:56:58.593 --> 03:57:00.213]  There will be more.
[03:57:00.213 --> 03:57:02.134]  But for now, that's it.
[03:57:02.134 --> 03:57:02.934]  Thanks so much.
[03:57:02.934 --> 03:57:03.955]  In the fourth hour here,
