[00:00.000 --> 00:28.340]  if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance it's Alex
[00:28.340 --> 00:36.440]  Jones ladies and gentlemen we are live and we are broadcasting worldwide thank
[00:36.440 --> 00:41.400]  you so much for joining us on this Tuesday January 30th 2018 global
[00:41.400 --> 00:46.440]  transmission we're gonna be here live the next four hours in the war room with
[00:46.440 --> 00:50.640]  Owen shroyer is coming up we'll have live coverage right after that right
[00:50.640 --> 00:55.920]  through this first key state of the union by President Trump and a lot more
[00:55.920 --> 01:00.800]  coming up tonight at info wars.com forward slash show and many of our
[01:00.800 --> 01:06.000]  AM and FM as well as TV stations not just radio stations they're now picking
[01:06.000 --> 01:14.120]  up the transmission as I predicted wasn't hard they voted along party lines to
[01:14.120 --> 01:21.560]  release the memo to the public unless the president bars its release and then
[01:21.560 --> 01:26.320]  Congress could still go around that but Trump has signal he won't do that and it
[01:26.320 --> 01:32.000]  should be out by Wednesday or Thursday and so it's following the timeline that
[01:32.000 --> 01:37.200]  I was given by congressional sources last week and we had Congressman Gates on
[01:37.200 --> 01:42.040]  yesterday the very important interview that we'll be airing some excerpts of
[01:42.040 --> 01:47.800]  today showing that these are cornered rats right now and that we're in a real
[01:47.800 --> 01:52.440]  danger zone because there's no telling what they're gonna pull or what they're
[01:52.440 --> 01:56.120]  going to do and that there are criminal investigations going on of these people
[01:56.120 --> 02:01.560]  and it's believed that when the memo is made public that is basically to embarrass
[02:01.560 --> 02:07.000]  the Justice Department who's been sitting on top of these crimes so it's a
[02:07.000 --> 02:13.480]  big deal dims left literally shaking over hashtag release the memo vote that's
[02:13.480 --> 02:18.600]  an information liberation article on info wars.com executive branch now has
[02:18.600 --> 02:25.880]  custody of Intel memo for review prior to release and White House spokesperson
[02:25.880 --> 02:30.760]  Conway has said the president will not release it it's obviously too soon to do
[02:30.760 --> 02:34.720]  plus he couldn't break it all down during the state of the Union many people
[02:34.720 --> 02:39.840]  are telling the president I agree with him to focus on the successes and to
[02:39.840 --> 02:43.120]  thank the American people for seeing through the propaganda and coming
[02:43.120 --> 02:46.240]  together and that a lot of the mainstream media is owned by foreign
[02:46.240 --> 02:51.600]  interest and the communist Chinese and that they are here literally trying to
[02:51.600 --> 02:55.480]  keep Americans from getting control of their government again that is the
[02:55.480 --> 02:59.480]  stake through the vampire's heart you explain that these big mega banks for
[02:59.480 --> 03:04.040]  tax exempt you explain that Bezos and others are basically tax exempt while
[03:04.040 --> 03:07.800]  they push world government and tax increases on the middle class it's
[03:07.800 --> 03:11.400]  game over and that's what's happening all the world people are discovering
[03:11.400 --> 03:15.040]  globalism that it's real that it's unelected and it's game over I saw a
[03:15.040 --> 03:20.280]  headline on CNN this morning and we can pull it up but I've got a screenshot of
[03:20.280 --> 03:27.200]  it here it was Titans Unite to attack America's tapeworm rising health care
[03:27.200 --> 03:32.680]  costs drain the US economy Jeff Bezos Warren Buffett and Jamie Dimon want to
[03:32.680 --> 03:37.200]  resolve that just document cam shot I've got it one way or another out here so
[03:37.200 --> 03:44.440]  that's the front page of CNN and these are the very people engineering
[03:44.440 --> 03:53.400]  globalism these are the very people carrying out these operations and it's
[03:53.400 --> 04:00.440]  sick how they operate I mean here's here's the new headline CNN's change
[04:00.440 --> 04:04.200]  their headline to Jeff Bezos Warren Buffett and Jamie Dimon want to fix
[04:04.200 --> 04:09.840]  health care oh like they fixed everything else driving things into
[04:09.840 --> 04:16.240]  centralized combines into monopoly systems so Jeff Bezos Warren Buffett and
[04:16.240 --> 04:20.760]  Jamie Dimon want to fix health care when they're the ones that have been
[04:20.760 --> 04:24.680]  pushing for the centralization for the socialism the more money you throw at
[04:24.680 --> 04:29.000]  education taxpayer the higher the price the lower the quality the more money you
[04:29.000 --> 04:32.360]  throw at health care discovered controlled it creates combines and
[04:32.360 --> 04:38.560]  monopolies and inside boondoggle deals and it drives up the price drives down
[04:38.560 --> 04:44.200]  the quality and so yeah it used to be one-twelfth of our economy then it was
[04:44.200 --> 04:48.360]  one-tenth now it's was one-seventh down to Obamacare they're saying it's almost
[04:48.360 --> 04:53.520]  one-fifth it's what it's designed to do the big insurance companies that these
[04:53.520 --> 04:58.160]  guys are all invested in wrote Obamacare as a screw job and now they're back with
[04:58.160 --> 05:04.760]  a bigger screw job I'm so excited the new product in infowarslife.com in a
[05:04.760 --> 05:09.800]  glass bottle two month servings filled to the brim filled to the absolute top
[05:09.800 --> 05:16.160]  the real red pill this is a heart and brain pill a new tropic that doesn't
[05:16.160 --> 05:20.280]  have any stimulants in it but boy does it stimulate because it's beyond that
[05:20.280 --> 05:26.080]  quite frankly I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their
[05:26.080 --> 05:29.640]  patients but it wasn't prescription but they were charging people a hundred
[05:29.640 --> 05:34.800]  two hundred dollars for the formulae and I came up with our own formulae working
[05:34.800 --> 05:39.760]  with some scientists and developers non-gmo made right here in America 120
[05:39.760 --> 05:45.160]  capsules and ladies and gentlemen you add the preglinone to it which is the

[06:22.560 --> 06:30.160]  from deep in the heart of FEMA region 6 Austin Texas transmitting worldwide it's
[06:30.160 --> 06:33.600]  Alex Jones
[06:35.040 --> 06:41.360]  ladies and gentlemen we are here broadcasting worldwide awaiting the
[06:41.360 --> 06:45.160]  president who's going to be speaking tonight and we're going to be carrying
[06:45.160 --> 06:48.680]  the state of the union the first day of the union this critical state of the
[06:48.680 --> 06:51.840]  union now we actually have a president who's trying to restore the Republic and
[06:51.840 --> 06:56.600]  bring power back to the country actually bring sovereignty and legislative
[06:56.600 --> 07:00.680]  executive judicial control back to the states and back to the people this is
[07:00.680 --> 07:04.560]  going to be critical we're going to be looking at some of the statements out of
[07:04.560 --> 07:09.280]  the White House but what we can expect to unfold from this and I'm told by a
[07:09.280 --> 07:13.240]  little bird in the White House that before I'm off air today we're going to
[07:13.240 --> 07:18.120]  get talking points that are going to be a preview of what's coming up tonight
[07:18.120 --> 07:24.120]  that could come in any minute but that's a phone call I've got to make because
[07:24.120 --> 07:27.920]  I haven't talked to an individual since yesterday it's always important to
[07:27.920 --> 07:33.600]  remind them of things they've reminded us about because a lot is going on so look
[07:33.600 --> 07:38.280]  for that coming up today we'll have live coverage info wars.com forward slash show
[07:38.280 --> 07:43.480]  many of our TV and radio affiliates will be picking it up and we're going to be
[07:43.480 --> 07:48.840]  basically commercial free we're going to have some breaks and things but we're
[07:48.840 --> 07:53.120]  going to cut the ads down about 90% during that live transmission and
[07:53.120 --> 07:57.360]  obviously no ads during the state of the union itself so info wars.com forward
[07:57.360 --> 08:00.480]  slash show and in the next month we'll be able to announce three new TV
[08:00.480 --> 08:06.280]  satellites three new TV satellites that we're going to be on for our TV
[08:06.280 --> 08:10.360]  affiliates out there we're getting rid of the one getting rid of the one coming
[08:10.360 --> 08:17.080]  back with the three so look for that this obviously is the big news the house
[08:17.080 --> 08:21.200]  voted to release the memo that wasn't a hard prediction to make and that was a
[08:21.200 --> 08:29.240]  vote along party lines FBI director Ray shot to his court by FISA memo McCabe
[08:29.240 --> 08:34.280]  removed next day more heads to roll that's on info wars.com from the great
[08:34.280 --> 08:38.360]  folks at zero hedge Tucker reveals McCabe is under DOJ scrutiny that means
[08:38.360 --> 08:43.240]  criminal investigation that's exactly what I've been told by my sources well
[08:43.240 --> 08:47.800]  I mean it's gonna come out in the memo Andrew McCabe's pensions worth 1.8
[08:47.800 --> 08:53.560]  million isn't that nice continuing along those lines Jim Acosta spreads fake
[08:53.560 --> 09:01.160]  news tries to correct it said that Trump had fired McCabe but then had to come
[09:01.160 --> 09:04.080]  out later and say that he just left because of all the corruption coming
[09:04.080 --> 09:07.120]  out it was too big of an eyesore ahead of the memo that's about to come out
[09:07.120 --> 09:13.160]  how McCabe quarterbacked ran the entire operation while telling the president
[09:13.160 --> 09:17.360]  he was loyal to his face and that it was all pure BS he was one of the main
[09:17.360 --> 09:22.800]  leakers we now know and was still under the control of Comey until yesterday
[09:22.800 --> 09:29.200]  Comey was still directing the FBI Mueller Comey McCabe that's how it how it works
[09:29.200 --> 09:36.240]  so the royal succession has been broken but because the Clinton crime network
[09:36.240 --> 09:43.480]  chief Mueller has had his his operatives now at least at that level
[09:43.480 --> 09:49.720]  removed now he will desperately battle like the old crocodile he is to try to
[09:49.720 --> 09:53.200]  bring down Trump because to the Democratic Party and the rest of them
[09:53.200 --> 09:59.840]  McCain was their party leader he's now dying of a brain tumor stricken and then
[09:59.840 --> 10:06.720]  we have Mueller who is their their their last hope and of course he's being
[10:06.720 --> 10:11.480]  completely exposed and so they just don't know what to do the country was
[10:11.480 --> 10:15.440]  theirs any crime they wanted to commit was theirs the Clintons could do whatever
[10:15.440 --> 10:19.080]  they wanted they could meet on tarmacs illegally with the head of the Justice
[10:19.080 --> 10:24.400]  Department it didn't matter all their little plans have now gone down the
[10:24.400 --> 10:32.760]  rat hole so we've got that Jim Acosta article but also other fake news public
[10:32.760 --> 10:37.120]  broadcaster admits to increasing booing sounds during Trump's debauch speech
[10:37.120 --> 10:40.480]  well you can actually hear him click it we'll play that audio first right now
[10:40.480 --> 10:45.880]  you can't just turn up the booze and then not turn up Trump speaking you can
[10:45.880 --> 10:52.760]  hear that they've gone in with an effect live and actually added more booze over
[10:52.760 --> 10:56.100]  it knowing that booze might be coming and they wanted to boost them and they
[10:56.100 --> 11:01.960]  would use the real low-level booze to to then augment larger booze and we saw
[11:01.960 --> 11:07.040]  this when he went to the Texas the college championship game the Texas
[11:07.040 --> 11:12.440]  wasn't involved in Alabama probably a slip and he marches in huge five minute
[11:12.440 --> 11:17.200]  standing ovation but outside there's a small group maybe 150 booing in the rain
[11:17.200 --> 11:21.240]  when he drives by and the media said he was booed when he arrived and when he
[11:21.240 --> 11:24.680]  came into the stadium you had to watch the football game to actually see him
[11:24.680 --> 11:28.960]  getting a standing ovation went on for almost five minutes but the media would
[11:28.960 --> 11:32.520]  just show the booing outside and say that that's what happened basically inside
[11:32.520 --> 11:37.680]  so that's how their tactics work and now the state broadcaster has had to admit
[11:37.680 --> 11:41.840]  that it was a fraud president Trump gave a speech at Davos again delivering sharp
[11:41.840 --> 11:44.660]  criticism of the mainstream media he stated it wasn't until I became a
[11:44.660 --> 11:48.680]  politician I realized how nasty how mean how vicious and how fake the press can
[11:48.680 --> 11:53.360]  be ARD released a clip of the speech on its Twitter account for popular news
[11:53.360 --> 11:58.080]  program and it was distinct booze to be heard directly after the president's
[11:58.080 --> 12:01.880]  comments they went on to admit that they augmented and boosted the booze that's
[12:01.880 --> 12:06.520]  not how audio works ladies and gentlemen they knew booze might be coming they
[12:06.520 --> 12:11.120]  laid louder booze down over it they're trying to get out of it saying okay well
[12:11.120 --> 12:15.560]  we did just boost those you can't in one audio track do that you've got to go in
[12:15.560 --> 12:20.280]  and you've got to add it if it's live with another stream over now you can go
[12:20.280 --> 12:25.400]  into after-effects and all the other systems and pro tools of my video and
[12:25.400 --> 12:28.400]  audio I'm not an expert at it but I followed it for years and edited films
[12:28.400 --> 12:34.240]  and audio many times just folks know and you're sitting there looking at it you've
[12:34.240 --> 12:38.200]  got to go into the wavelength and turn up only those areas but it'll distort the
[12:38.200 --> 12:43.280]  audio too much so instead they just click a button and pot up booze even more
[12:43.280 --> 12:48.680]  fraudulent so let's go ahead and play that clip and it wasn't till I became a
[12:48.680 --> 12:56.320]  politician that I realized how nasty how mean how vicious and how fake the press
[12:56.320 --> 13:05.040]  can be as the cameras start going off in the back but but here how fake that is
[13:05.040 --> 13:11.280]  boo boo I mean they just were so lazy they even have an audio fall it started
[13:11.280 --> 13:17.280]  low and up they just oh that's it hmm we've got the boo effect okay somebody
[13:17.280 --> 13:22.160]  boo we use that discover whoo whoo to the audio engineer whoo that's how you do
[13:22.160 --> 13:29.280]  it whoo it's ridiculous imagine if we were covering an event live tonight like
[13:29.280 --> 13:33.560]  to say the union we're gonna cover and if I said just add some booze in at
[13:33.560 --> 13:39.680]  critical points can you imagine telling the I would never even think of
[13:39.680 --> 13:43.280]  anything like that but see that's what they really do on shows like Colbert
[13:43.280 --> 13:47.880]  it's a teleprompter reading actor posing as a comedian posing as a news
[13:47.880 --> 13:51.800]  person and then hiding behind the factor a comedian to put out fake news
[13:51.800 --> 13:55.880]  constant laugh tracks or when they have a live studio audience they have a person
[13:55.880 --> 14:01.560]  they're telling you when to applause telling you when to boo because I've
[14:01.560 --> 14:05.000]  been on these shows I I've been on these comedy shows I've been on these late
[14:05.000 --> 14:11.200]  night shows but a lot of times a lot of these shows like Trevor Noah and and
[14:11.200 --> 14:15.680]  Oliver whatever his name is I forget all their names those are just shot on a
[14:15.680 --> 14:20.320]  soundstage there's no one there and it's like a laugh track from a 1960s or
[14:20.320 --> 14:26.000]  1970s show or something oh look Archie Bunker's the dumb old white guy
[14:26.000 --> 14:32.520]  play the same canned recorded stuff remember being a little kid hating the
[14:32.520 --> 14:36.080]  laugh tracks because I was a little kid watching these shows and we're going
[14:36.080 --> 14:41.000]  that's fake because I can hear each time it was the same applause the same whistle
[14:41.000 --> 14:47.200]  the same whatever and again we all know that that's what I'm saying is they took
[14:47.200 --> 14:53.440]  all of those theatrical things and superimposed it over the news and it's
[14:53.440 --> 14:58.760]  what they do constantly so I know you know the tactics but just the tactics
[14:58.760 --> 15:04.800]  of reporting on 150 people paid by Soros and the Democratic Party to be there
[15:04.800 --> 15:09.760]  booing they ignore the 78,000 crowds
[15:10.200 --> 15:15.240]  cheering him up basically unanimously it it's not about Trump it's about the
[15:15.240 --> 15:19.040]  truth and it's about how these people deceive over and over and over again
[15:19.040 --> 15:23.760]  all right we're gonna come back from the break and get into some of these
[15:23.760 --> 15:30.920]  incredible audio clips of mr. Schiff Adam Schiff who leads the Democrat side
[15:30.920 --> 15:34.520]  of the House Intelligence Committee squirming how it's a horrible day for
[15:34.520 --> 15:38.080]  America that this memo is coming out I thought it was nothing I thought it was
[15:38.080 --> 15:42.640]  fake I thought Nunez and pulled it out of his rump you know it was blah blah
[15:42.640 --> 15:53.160]  blah blah now they're like a little Adam Schiff what a good little beady-eyed

[20:01.680 --> 20:23.320]  you're listening to the alex jones show defending the republic from enemies
[20:23.320 --> 20:38.560]  foreign and domestic it's alex jones all right I remember more than a year and
[20:38.560 --> 20:43.360]  a half ago when Roger stone was being called a Russian agent when we were at
[20:43.360 --> 20:49.520]  the RNC was getting really mad about it and actually you know cussing and stuff
[20:49.520 --> 20:54.040]  and I said dude relax it's ridiculous no one's gonna buy that we all know it's
[20:54.040 --> 20:58.680]  bull and then they started calling me a Russian agent I said I got really mad
[20:58.680 --> 21:03.040]  because you know it's like saying you rape somebody or you're a traitor I
[21:03.040 --> 21:08.600]  mean those are fighting words plus it's wrong to say this about Russia because
[21:08.600 --> 21:11.600]  they're hardly involved in our politics compared to the globalists and
[21:11.600 --> 21:15.200]  multinational corporations and Facebook and Google and Twitter and the
[21:15.200 --> 21:19.800]  communist Chinese it's also a smoke stream to the real national security
[21:19.800 --> 21:24.360]  issues we have and our own Pentagon and own CIA and all of them tell us it's the
[21:24.360 --> 21:28.080]  communist Chinese and it's multinational corporations that are taking the
[21:28.080 --> 21:33.280]  country over Silicon Valley heads are coming out admitting that globalism is
[21:33.280 --> 21:37.840]  the big issue with losing sovereignty and losing free market and and and
[21:37.840 --> 21:42.600]  dealing with monopolies and then I realized the Democrats admitted this
[21:42.600 --> 21:47.160]  they were gonna use this Russia gate thing even if Hillary got in to shut
[21:47.160 --> 21:51.600]  down their political competition and then when she lost they intended to
[21:51.600 --> 21:56.000]  overturn the election have new elections run by Homeland Security with an
[21:56.000 --> 22:01.560]  executive order Obama had put in all 50 states wrote letters including a
[22:01.560 --> 22:05.440]  Democrat attorney generals unanimously saying do not federalize our elections
[22:05.440 --> 22:10.040]  it violates the Federalist Papers it violates the Constitution separation of
[22:10.040 --> 22:14.520]  the powers but Trump's never reversed that I don't know if he understands it
[22:14.520 --> 22:20.560]  or knows it that's in place and so you see Schiff saying Tucker Carlson's a
[22:20.560 --> 22:27.240]  Russian agent to his face but McCain on the Senate floor pointing at Rand Paul
[22:27.240 --> 22:30.400]  senator Paul saying then you are an agent of Putin you need to be
[22:30.400 --> 22:34.600]  investigated you work for Putin Paul just turns and walks off because he voted
[22:34.600 --> 22:38.480]  against giving heavy weapons to Ukraine and escalating this whole thing which
[22:38.480 --> 22:44.960]  has now happened it's ridiculous so that's the big thing Trump's doing wrong
[22:44.960 --> 22:50.280]  is being bullied and by the neocons and others in to show them you're tough on
[22:50.280 --> 22:54.080]  Russia and even having more sanctions and aggressive stuff than Obama did I
[22:54.080 --> 23:02.160]  mean this is crazy but I digress so now we have clips I mean I've got so many of
[23:02.160 --> 23:06.280]  me came and play them all where the Democrats are now saying we think
[23:06.280 --> 23:10.560]  Devin Nunes the head of the House Intelligence Committee he's a Russian
[23:10.560 --> 23:14.080]  agent and remember just last week they sent out hundreds of thousands of
[23:14.080 --> 23:17.720]  letters Twitter saying oh you don't like Hillary or you don't like the Democrats
[23:17.720 --> 23:21.640]  you're a Russian bot and then people started getting mad so Twitter had to
[23:21.640 --> 23:26.160]  admit okay you're not Russian bots but that was under orders from Schiff had
[23:26.160 --> 23:30.640]  sent him a letter the day before saying these people are all Russian bots and
[23:30.640 --> 23:34.960]  they took his orders just like in that house hearing they had two months ago
[23:34.960 --> 23:38.880]  where congressman quickly goes I saw info wars was number one at lunch on
[23:38.880 --> 23:44.680]  Twitter and they go sure we we censored him at lunch and Google and Facebook go
[23:44.680 --> 23:51.160]  we we helped to see they take orders from these Democrat Congress people so
[23:51.160 --> 23:56.240]  they that's in the hearing so they they call up and they say you can see the
[23:56.240 --> 23:59.480]  video on info wars calm video dem lawmaker and as Twitter since her info
[23:59.480 --> 24:05.320]  wars this is how they operate so we know last week Schiff wrote a letter a public
[24:05.320 --> 24:09.000]  letter saying all these conservatives are Russian bots the next day they start
[24:09.000 --> 24:12.160]  shutting people's accounts off then they had to back office and a letter back
[24:12.160 --> 24:16.640]  it was such a backlash saying these are real Americans we investigated so
[24:16.640 --> 24:21.240]  imagine you're a Russian you're a Russian you're Russian this is ridiculous by
[24:21.240 --> 24:25.800]  the people that are suing us out to the globalist they're the outside power so
[24:25.800 --> 24:29.160]  what do they do because we wake up to the fact they're the outside power that's
[24:29.160 --> 24:32.320]  what's gonna bring them down they have to go no you're the outside power it's
[24:32.320 --> 24:38.080]  the Russians what have I said the trump card for 10 plus years expose the
[24:38.080 --> 24:42.280]  globalist are unelected expose their multinational expose their taking over
[24:42.280 --> 24:45.840]  their international agreements the EU's unelected it'll all come down it's
[24:45.840 --> 24:50.440]  happening I'm not a rocket scientist authoritarian above the law tax exempt
[24:50.440 --> 24:55.360]  wanting us to be poor we don't get to vote on it we're getting rid of this
[24:55.360 --> 25:00.120]  we're gonna use our old system to take your system down so now here's one of
[25:00.120 --> 25:03.360]  the video clips I'll have to go to the next segment with these there's so many
[25:03.360 --> 25:09.080]  MSNBC suggests Devin Noon has become a Russian agent then Schiff very sad day
[25:09.080 --> 25:13.720]  committee voted but presidents personal interest above national oh the
[25:13.720 --> 25:17.760]  president's personal we elected the president you're trying to steal the
[25:17.760 --> 25:24.000]  election from us see how they spin that though that the president isn't America
[25:24.000 --> 25:28.840]  they're telling when the Democrats said take Jack Pasobak security clearance
[25:28.840 --> 25:33.480]  he's in naval intelligence and he's were a big Trump supporter with one of the
[25:33.480 --> 25:37.200]  biggest Trump fan groups and the president tweets and stuff all the time
[25:37.200 --> 25:41.520]  and lightsing you can't have somebody in the Navy that the president likes we're
[25:41.520 --> 25:46.280]  going that's how alien these folks are to America they're like the president
[25:46.280 --> 25:53.960]  likes him he can't be trusted the globalist snowflake zone so they
[25:53.960 --> 25:57.880]  know they're the foreign power they're the multinational Russia's kicked the
[25:57.880 --> 26:01.480]  same globalist out so that's the only kinship we have there and that's what
[26:01.480 --> 26:04.560]  they're so angry about but you think they hate Russians that they've had their
[26:04.560 --> 26:09.280]  way with for 85 years now no they they want to have their way with us they've
[26:09.280 --> 26:12.280]  already had their way partially they want to have their way they really want
[26:12.280 --> 26:18.560]  to have their way people like Bernie Sanders I've only swindled universities
[26:18.560 --> 26:24.080]  no I'm gonna swindle all country with my wife you know why she was 500 pounds she
[26:24.080 --> 26:29.840]  ate the student savings bonds so here it is suggest debonunas has become a
[26:29.840 --> 26:34.160]  Russian agent possible that the Republican chairman of the House of
[26:34.160 --> 26:37.000]  Intel Committee has been compromised by the Russians is it possible if they
[26:37.000 --> 26:40.200]  actually have a Russian agent running the House Intel Committee on the
[26:40.200 --> 26:44.680]  Republican side I hope that's not the case I can't have no information to
[26:44.680 --> 26:50.040]  suggest that it is I think this doesn't his behavior speak of that though I mean
[26:50.040 --> 26:53.280]  I'm not the first person who's raised this he's behaving like someone who's
[26:53.280 --> 26:58.840]  been compromised that guy is behaving like somebody that drives around a
[26:58.840 --> 27:03.760]  white creeper van just saying now he does kind of look and act like that but I
[27:03.760 --> 27:08.000]  could say anything you know you guys behavior looks like you both tortured
[27:08.000 --> 27:11.240]  your wives of death this morning I'm not saying you literally did that I mean no
[27:11.240 --> 27:15.160]  his behavior is he realizes there's firing globalist powers in control of
[27:15.160 --> 27:20.400]  this country and the whole new process has been butchered in a criminal cabal
[27:20.400 --> 27:23.560]  of Democrats that thought Hillary was gonna win we have the text messages
[27:23.560 --> 27:27.720]  tried to put out fake info to damage the presidential candidate and the

[31:59.240 --> 32:04.560]  FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe has been removed from the bureau just one
[32:04.560 --> 32:09.320]  day after the FBI chief read the secret FISA memo. McCabe's roles in both the
[32:09.320 --> 32:13.720]  Clinton email investigation and Russia probe came into question after it was
[32:13.720 --> 32:18.200]  reported last week that he is named in the four-page memo alleging shocking
[32:18.200 --> 32:22.200]  revelations of collusion and corruption. McCabe's removal comes the day after
[32:22.200 --> 32:27.960]  acting FBI Director Christopher Ray read the FISA memo on Capitol Hill and on the
[32:27.960 --> 32:33.040]  day the House votes on its release. Though McCabe is set to retire sometime in
[32:33.040 --> 32:37.480]  March the timing of this development is pretty peculiar. One source said McCabe
[32:37.480 --> 32:41.960]  was exercising his retirement eligibility and characterized his decision as
[32:41.960 --> 32:46.200]  stepping aside. And McCabe was even taunted on Twitter by President Trump
[32:46.200 --> 32:50.960]  after news of his retirement broke in December. Trump tweeted FBI Deputy
[32:50.960 --> 32:55.680]  Director Andrew McCabe is racing the clock to retire with full benefits 90
[32:55.680 --> 33:00.880]  days to go. Leigh Ann McAdoo info wars.com

[33:37.640 --> 33:42.520]  and down we got the globalists in a stranglehold. The walls are closing in
[33:42.520 --> 33:47.400]  on them. The globalist criminal sorrows stay behind networks and the Clinton
[33:47.400 --> 33:51.800]  crime networks are hanging on by their fingernails more and more of them are
[33:51.800 --> 33:56.400]  resigning. Many others are being indicted that's right they're operatives that
[33:56.400 --> 34:03.800]  uranium one their entire crime network is being rolled up the storm is here. The
[34:03.800 --> 34:07.680]  globalists have had their storm now we have our storm. I'm gonna get back to the
[34:07.680 --> 34:14.200]  MSNBC saying that Devin Nunes must be a Russian agent with no proof but first
[34:14.200 --> 34:19.880]  the new article's gone up on info wars.com and news wars.com we need to
[34:19.880 --> 34:26.200]  spread this article because this is what fear looks like Jamie White writes for
[34:26.200 --> 34:36.200]  info wars.com. Pelosi melts down over hashtag release the memo on CNN. House
[34:36.200 --> 34:40.440]  majority leader Nancy Pelosi melted down on CNN following the House intelligence
[34:40.440 --> 34:44.760]  committee vote to release the secret Pfizer memo allegedly detailing abuse by
[34:44.760 --> 34:48.120]  the Justice Department Obama administration. She then gets into an
[34:48.120 --> 34:54.040]  argument with Como. Big shakeups happening and again Schiff who is saying
[34:54.040 --> 34:57.920]  oh there's no real evidence it's all no big deal two weeks ago is don't release
[34:57.920 --> 35:02.680]  the memo no no it's a sad day for America don't put the president's rights
[35:02.680 --> 35:08.280]  above above yours America you're trying to remove the guy we elected who's had
[35:08.280 --> 35:12.680]  the economy turn around while you guys try to stop it with all your gloom and
[35:12.680 --> 35:18.520]  doom I'm surprised we've got this much done. Unbelievable you know in China they
[35:18.520 --> 35:22.560]  execute you for trying to cheerlead the economy down I think that's wrong I'm
[35:22.560 --> 35:26.160]  just saying these people are out live with China doing in America what China
[35:26.160 --> 35:32.320]  has outlawed. Incredible so continuing here ladies and gentlemen let's go to
[35:32.320 --> 35:39.680]  Nancy Pelosi as she spazes out on CNN. Why would they put at the mercy of
[35:39.680 --> 35:42.680]  Dennis Nunes who doesn't even remember the memo and say the American people
[35:42.680 --> 35:47.160]  should see it. The DOJ is only one part of the intelligence community. The
[35:47.160 --> 35:53.440]  intelligence community is vast it's the CIA, the DNA, the DNI, the national
[35:53.440 --> 35:58.880]  defense everybody has their element of it. So she calls him I think Dennis
[35:58.880 --> 36:03.480]  Miller not even Dennis Nunes as you know he's Devin Nunes the chairman of the
[36:03.480 --> 36:08.360]  House Intelligence Committee she said like at least 12 or more speeches I've
[36:08.360 --> 36:13.120]  seen that George W. Bush is in office and George W. Bush is a Russian agent and
[36:13.120 --> 36:19.240]  even though he had been in office in nine plus years and continuing here we've
[36:19.240 --> 36:29.360]  got her saying it's the director of DNI so she gets she calls the DNI DNA so the
[36:29.360 --> 36:34.040]  director of national intelligence is now the director of DNA so there's just no
[36:34.040 --> 36:39.760]  end to this lady let's go ahead and play the next clip where Pelosi turns on
[36:39.760 --> 36:45.400]  Como. So for Ray got gave the director of the FBI obviously recently selected by
[36:45.400 --> 36:50.000]  President Trump he got the memo he could have come out and said this is reckless
[36:50.000 --> 36:54.920]  don't release it. Let me just say this with all due respect you really don't
[36:54.920 --> 36:58.160]  know what you're talking about right now. But did Christopher Ray look at it or
[36:58.160 --> 37:03.960]  no? I can't say whether he did or not but he did not. So we probably should watch
[37:03.960 --> 37:07.720]  the whole interview she is a babbling mess and they are totally panicked
[37:07.720 --> 37:13.160]  because she was involved Donna Brazile was involved the word is Adam Schiff
[37:13.160 --> 37:16.120]  was involved they've all been in meetings with the Clintons they've all
[37:16.120 --> 37:19.400]  been in meetings going back before the election even took place on November 8th
[37:19.400 --> 37:25.560]  fixing all of this fake intelligence and getting the fake warrants and that's
[37:25.560 --> 37:31.280]  what the FISA memo that's been declassified the 99 pages 10% of it is
[37:31.280 --> 37:35.120]  still blacked out says that that the FISA court said three times this is
[37:35.120 --> 37:41.560]  illegal. Now let's move on to see what the rest of fear looks like. Pinhead Adam
[37:41.560 --> 37:46.800]  Schiff very sad day committee voted to put President's personal interest above
[37:46.800 --> 37:54.080]  the nation. We have votes today to politicize the intelligence process to
[37:54.080 --> 37:57.480]  prohibit the FBI and the Department of Justice from expressing their concerns
[37:57.480 --> 38:02.320]  to our committee and to the House and to selectively release to the public
[38:02.320 --> 38:09.560]  only the majority's distorted memo without the full facts. A very sad day I
[38:09.560 --> 38:14.920]  think in the history of this committee as I said to my committee colleagues
[38:14.920 --> 38:20.120]  during this hearing sadly we can fully expect that the President of the United
[38:20.120 --> 38:24.520]  States will not put the national interest over his own personal interest
[38:24.520 --> 38:30.360]  but it is a sad day indeed when that is also true of our own committee because
[38:30.360 --> 38:34.880]  today this committee voted to put the President's personal interest perhaps
[38:34.880 --> 38:39.080]  their own political interest above the national interest in denying themselves
[38:39.080 --> 38:44.640]  even the ability to hear from the department and the FBI and that is I
[38:44.640 --> 38:50.440]  think a deeply regrettable state of affairs but it does show how in my view
[38:50.440 --> 38:55.600]  when you have a deeply flawed person in the Oval Office that flaw can infect the
[38:55.600 --> 39:01.720]  whole of government and today tragically it infected our committee. No Adam
[39:01.720 --> 39:07.320]  Schiff you are the infection you're the people that tried to overturn a duly
[39:07.320 --> 39:10.480]  elected president with made-up Russia gate crap when you guys are up to your
[39:10.480 --> 39:13.880]  eyeballs with the Russians the common to Chinese anybody else that'll pay you
[39:13.880 --> 39:17.760]  and you know it and you know you work for the globalists that have sold this
[39:17.760 --> 39:22.320]  country out and that America is back and you can't stand it and so the
[39:22.320 --> 39:26.880]  president's supposed to lay down all the media lies and while McCabe lies and
[39:26.880 --> 39:33.360]  while Comey lies and leaks and does all this and then not release the FISA court
[39:33.360 --> 39:39.520]  investigation and other investigations into what you did in those meetings
[39:39.520 --> 39:44.280]  insurance policies secret societies we can't let this guy get elected we got
[39:44.280 --> 39:48.720]  to get this guy to office we got to kill this guy and you know it's gonna come out
[39:48.720 --> 39:55.360]  when the president releases it with those FBI agents dumb enough in text
[39:55.360 --> 40:01.280]  messages on government phones to talk about killing the president and that's
[40:01.280 --> 40:08.280]  why the former head of counter terrorism for the CIA then for the FBI went on
[40:08.280 --> 40:11.640]  television and showed it the former director of the CIA and former director
[40:11.640 --> 40:19.560]  of national intelligence all went on CNN and CNN coverage of the Aspen
[40:19.560 --> 40:23.760]  Institute in front of the establishment said he'll be gone in two months and
[40:23.760 --> 40:27.880]  it's not gonna be legislative it's not gonna be impeachment it's not gonna be
[40:27.880 --> 40:32.160]  judicial everybody goes what's that mean and they go you'll see they're on TV
[40:32.160 --> 40:41.520]  saying Trump we're coming for you we're gonna kill you to make it look like
[40:41.520 --> 40:45.360]  everything was PC King for all their operatives in their deep state people
[40:45.360 --> 40:49.520]  hold the line stay here you're safe or like in the text messages none of this
[40:49.520 --> 40:53.960]  is real there's no Russian collusion this is dangerous it's in the text messages
[40:53.960 --> 41:01.080]  continue on McCabe continue press the attack this is illegal do it you're in
[41:01.080 --> 41:07.080]  this deep enough yes sir and then they all ran to Congress and ran to the
[41:07.080 --> 41:19.320]  president under his wings come on chickens come on little chickies but I'm
[41:19.320 --> 41:23.120]  not gonna count my chickens for they hatch but man just you know when Darth
[41:23.120 --> 41:27.400]  Vader's got Luke Skywalker and he says I have you now he doesn't so and of course
[41:27.400 --> 41:29.800]  they're really Darth Vader we're Luke Skywalker but you gotta ask yourself who's
[41:29.800 --> 41:34.840]  the who's the hero who's there do sex who's there Millennium Falcon coming
[41:34.840 --> 41:39.520]  screaming in to stop us from stopping them cuz let me tell you something right
[41:39.520 --> 41:43.720]  now the allegory goes either way we're about to squeeze the trigger and fire
[41:43.720 --> 41:47.960]  those torpedoes down the main reactor shaft or you put us in the other seat
[41:47.960 --> 41:50.960]  where Darth Vader and here comes a Millennium Falcon we got to blow that
[41:50.960 --> 41:57.720]  thing up politically show I'd be watching all sixes right now for what
[41:57.720 --> 42:02.080]  they're gonna pull cuz they want to set a new coffin DC they want to pull some
[42:02.080 --> 42:05.520]  kind of hanky-panky this is the time we're gonna do it more incredible clips

[47:07.920 --> 47:34.120]  alex jones here back live coming up in about three minutes I'm in a premier of
[47:34.120 --> 47:40.000]  this amazing video new twilight zone pilot set in the real world and you know
[47:40.000 --> 47:45.280]  it's not just a pilot we've actually pitched a new twilight zone I've had
[47:45.280 --> 47:50.840]  people pitch at me from one of the larger streaming systems actually that
[47:50.840 --> 47:55.280]  being produced with myself hosting it so it's it's funny that the guys came up
[47:55.280 --> 47:58.840]  with this separately so I gave them the headline and they said but is that true
[47:58.840 --> 48:02.840]  is it really a pilot and I said wait till I go on air I might just tell you
[48:02.840 --> 48:07.000]  about it but it's something I turned down a few years ago but something I might
[48:07.000 --> 48:11.320]  be interested in now because it just got pitched at me again but that's a whole
[48:11.320 --> 48:14.240]  other subject because it's I don't think I would have to go be in Hollywood or be
[48:14.240 --> 48:17.240]  part of it I could then see it see if I want to be part of it and then do the
[48:17.240 --> 48:22.120]  intros like Ron Serling of course you know the new X files character Chris
[48:22.120 --> 48:25.400]  Carter says the talk show host is based on me so so they just want to get me in
[48:25.400 --> 48:30.120]  these shows but then I personally will do this more important work so you might
[48:30.120 --> 48:33.160]  actually see this new twilight zone when there's truly a hosting it you can have
[48:33.160 --> 48:37.320]  the media have a conniption fit with that but I might just do it just to spy
[48:37.320 --> 48:41.320]  them I think I'm gonna take a couple big roles just to just a rub salt in their
[48:41.320 --> 48:43.880]  wound because they're trying to censor me and shut me down I'm like oh you're
[48:43.880 --> 48:47.800]  gonna do that let me open all these doors up boom boom boom boom boom boom see
[48:47.800 --> 48:51.840]  how you like that we haven't even begun to use our firepower on you okay we're
[48:51.840 --> 48:54.840]  doing it politically right here by the way I talked to Congressman Gates
[48:54.840 --> 48:57.440]  yesterday and I said why don't have him release the memo during the state of the
[48:57.440 --> 49:00.120]  Union the White House has said they aren't doing it but Gates has put on a
[49:00.120 --> 49:04.880]  press release he just sent us calling for that look I got to go to this video
[49:04.880 --> 49:08.160]  I'm not gonna have any time I just want to explain something to people DNA forces
[49:08.160 --> 49:12.040]  our flagship product with bio qq and coq 10 and the
[49:12.040 --> 49:15.440]  Nervary Growth Factor and all the rest of it and we were gonna come out with a
[49:15.440 --> 49:19.880]  DNA force plus that had even more of the ingredients that'll even lower price
[49:19.880 --> 49:24.360]  and because of contractual things and stuff we weren't able to do it that's
[49:24.360 --> 49:28.640]  what we came up with cell force and that's what cell force is is really DNA
[49:28.640 --> 49:33.000]  force plus more of the ingredient and even lower price and it's now massively
[49:33.000 --> 49:39.920]  discounted 50% off at infowarstore.com but take advantage of that while
[49:39.920 --> 49:42.880]  supplies last it is selling out then we're gonna come back out with it as
[49:42.880 --> 49:47.040]  DNA force plus because now we've got an authorization to do that right now
[49:47.040 --> 49:50.200]  though let's go ahead and go to the twilight zone here in the real world
[49:50.200 --> 49:57.520]  imagine a world where reality has no bounds a time and place dictated by
[49:57.520 --> 50:04.320]  feelings and emotion a land where all logic reasoning and common sense has
[50:04.320 --> 50:09.520]  been recklessly abandoned in a self-serving effort to please one's own
[50:09.520 --> 50:16.640]  beliefs only here can an individual hold two completely divergent ideas and
[50:16.640 --> 50:24.280]  consider it to be rational only here can be described as the twilight zone
[50:28.480 --> 50:33.560]  America 2018 the establishment controls most of the world's media has
[50:33.560 --> 50:38.760]  infiltrated the US government academia and the entertainment industry
[50:38.760 --> 50:44.600]  meanwhile rogue intelligence agencies launch a massive propaganda campaign
[50:44.600 --> 50:51.040]  to turn the American people against the president in preparation for a coup d'etat
[50:51.040 --> 50:59.240]  the president of the United States is racist he's a punk he's a dog he's a
[50:59.240 --> 51:07.760]  pig he's a con a bulls**t artist a mutt he's my mother as you bitch punk
[51:07.760 --> 51:16.200]  the president of the United States is a weak man in my book his lack of
[51:16.200 --> 51:20.600]  empathy his lack of leadership his lack of courage he's unfit to be human he is
[51:20.600 --> 51:38.760]  clearly trying to ignite a civil war in this country
[51:50.600 --> 52:20.400]  oh my what's your problem ma'am
[52:20.400 --> 52:28.240]  hi have I seen you before somewhere mindless zombies I could drop every
[52:28.240 --> 52:54.640]  single one of you look at this guy this guy's a joke the good old white days are over with the good old white days are over with a no more than days brother we have to fight back there will be casualties on both sides protesters followed Trump supporters to their cars as they left the convention center around the corner and away from police protection on
[52:54.640 --> 53:04.760]  st. Carlos Street a mob mentality took over these were pure attacks Trump supporters
[53:04.760 --> 53:20.040]  even the elderly left this video last night and walked right into danger throwing things at the guy who has a Trump shirt on oh he just got knocked in the back of the head he just got punched in the face and now they're rushing him
[53:20.040 --> 53:29.680]  dead to America
[53:33.680 --> 53:41.360]  America is divided social engineers brainwashed half of the country the
[53:41.360 --> 53:45.720]  believing of the president and his supporters are a threat to their
[53:45.720 --> 53:54.520]  existence but there is a resistance the other half of the country begins to rise
[53:54.520 --> 53:59.200]  up in defense of liberty to save the Republic
[53:59.200 --> 54:05.440]  meanwhile the globally use the spy grid to collect names of rebellion leaders
[54:05.440 --> 54:19.720]  in preparation for a big event this is not fiction this is the Twilight Zone
[54:19.720 --> 54:37.360]  you're aware that Roger Stone played a role in the Trump campaign it's gonna get more Twilight Zone from here
[54:37.360 --> 54:50.320]  Americanism not globalism will be our credo we're saying if you're out there and
[54:50.320 --> 54:54.280]  you're trying to represent your first amendment right to free speech if
[54:54.280 --> 54:58.200]  somebody comes and attacks you it's your right to defend yourself it got
[54:58.200 --> 55:07.760]  of the violence erupting at the effect of the fight broke out flying between Trump supporters and anti-Trump supporters
[55:07.760 --> 55:11.760]  yeah I want to warn the folks watching at home you're about to see some very violent footage
[55:11.760 --> 55:15.760]  you want to fight, get out of the way, you got one!
[55:15.760 --> 55:18.760]  you want to fight, get out of the way, you got one!
[55:18.760 --> 55:21.760]  you say you know your president and you shouldn't be
[55:21.760 --> 55:28.760]  you've got me, this is the heart of 1776
[55:28.760 --> 55:32.760]  Target Assange
[55:32.760 --> 55:43.760]  good evening everybody it may be time to declare war outright against the deep state and clear out the rot in the upper levels of the FBI and the Justice Department
[55:43.760 --> 55:48.760]  the media is rushing to slander and discredit those of us that are exposing this
[55:48.760 --> 55:51.760]  I'm here to warn people you keep telling me to shut up this isn't a game
[55:51.760 --> 55:57.760]  there are new concerns that anti-Trump FBI officials formed even a secret society
[55:57.760 --> 56:01.760]  at the FBI to subvert the president after his election
[56:01.760 --> 56:06.760]  stop there a secret society that secret meetings offside of the Justice Department
[56:06.760 --> 56:09.760]  really secret societies you can't make this stuff up
[56:09.760 --> 56:15.760]  let me give you one bottom line as the former government official government's going to kill this guy
[56:15.760 --> 56:20.760]  you take on the intelligence community they have six ways from Sunday of getting back at you
[56:20.760 --> 56:24.760]  it's one giant incestuous circle of corruption
[56:24.760 --> 56:26.760]  but the CIA is a rogue agency
[56:26.760 --> 56:28.760]  the White House and the president are citing simple words
[56:28.760 --> 56:33.760]  we have to start getting ready for insurrection and civil war because they're really pushing it
[56:33.760 --> 56:42.760]  what are we going to do if they kill the president and then order their local governments and their local federal branches to come arrest thousands of resistance leaders
[56:42.760 --> 56:49.760]  if they kill Trump it will move Trump it will cause a massive civil war in this country
[56:49.760 --> 56:51.760]  this is a female high-level emergency
[56:51.760 --> 56:56.760]  this is a national emergency and both constructions will follow
[56:56.760 --> 56:58.760]  we will have a fuck up level
[56:58.760 --> 57:00.760]  for the better
[57:00.760 --> 57:03.760]  but that will fall apart if I don't have any review
[57:03.760 --> 57:04.760]  we have to hurry
[57:04.760 --> 57:05.760]  remain calm
[57:05.760 --> 57:07.760]  go indoors immediately
[57:07.760 --> 57:08.760]  and stay indoors
[57:08.760 --> 57:10.760]  this is an emergency broadcast from FEMA
[57:10.760 --> 57:13.760]  in compliance with the United Nations
[57:13.760 --> 57:17.760]  the Department of Homeland Security has declared more civil war
[57:17.760 --> 57:20.760]  city officials are going for military help
[57:20.760 --> 57:24.760]  veins and troops are expected to arrive within the next two hours
[57:24.760 --> 57:26.760]  you've just witnessed a warning
[57:26.760 --> 57:28.760]  a warning from the future
[57:28.760 --> 57:33.760]  a warning that part of the republic will become so brainwashed and mentally ill
[57:33.760 --> 57:36.760]  that they volunteer their own energy
[57:36.760 --> 57:41.760]  for the destruction of their own country, livelihood and prosperity
[57:41.760 --> 57:45.760]  while being tricked into believing they were righteously saving the world
[57:45.760 --> 57:49.760]  a lesson in liberal logic from the twilight
[57:49.760 --> 57:50.760]  introducing fluorolife
[57:50.760 --> 57:54.760]  the new probiotic line developed exclusively by InfoWarsLife
[57:54.760 --> 57:56.760]  after years of research on the human microbiome
[57:56.760 --> 57:58.760]  not all probiotics are made the same
[57:58.760 --> 58:02.760]  fluorolife probiotics use a unique targeted delivery system
[58:02.760 --> 58:06.760]  that bypasses the stomach and releases directly into the intestines
[58:06.760 --> 58:07.760]  for maximum effect
[58:07.760 --> 58:11.760]  this is critical because stomach acid kills most probiotics
[58:11.760 --> 58:13.760]  so if you don't have a targeted delivery probiotic
[58:13.760 --> 58:16.760]  then you're cheating your gut health and your wallet
[58:16.760 --> 58:18.760]  fluorolife supports your body's core
[58:18.760 --> 58:19.760]  where you need it most
[58:19.760 --> 58:23.760]  including digestion, regularity, immunity, the gut lining and metabolism
[58:23.760 --> 58:27.760]  did you know that over 80% of your immune system is located in your gut?
[58:27.760 --> 58:28.760]  that's why
[58:28.760 --> 58:32.760]  increasing gut probiotic levels is so important for overall health
[58:32.760 --> 58:36.760]  fluorolife is sold as a 15 billion probiotic for everyday maintenance care
[58:36.760 --> 58:40.760]  and a 50 billion probiotic for a 30 day advanced gut restoration program
[58:40.760 --> 58:44.760]  head to InfoWarsLife.com to pick up your bottle of fluorolife probiotics today
[58:44.760 --> 58:46.760]  that's InfoWarsLife.com
[58:50.760 --> 58:52.760]  Matt and Ohio, you're on the air
[58:52.760 --> 58:53.760]  another Matt, go ahead
[58:53.760 --> 58:58.760]  hey listen, I just wanted to say real quick, I'm a long time listener of InfoWars
[58:58.760 --> 59:03.760]  and I just wanted to say that the t-shirts that you guys are offering are absolutely fantastic
[59:03.760 --> 59:07.760]  and that really is a great way to deal with this battle in the InfoWars
[59:07.760 --> 59:09.760]  it might seem like a simple thing
[59:09.760 --> 59:15.760]  but particularly these slogan t-shirts that you guys got up right now are absolutely amazing
[59:15.760 --> 59:18.760]  well thank you, my favorite new one is the
[59:18.760 --> 59:21.760]  don't tread on me but it says won't tread on me
[59:21.760 --> 59:24.760]  and it's a big day glow snake, gads and snake
[59:24.760 --> 59:27.760]  and then it's got the American flag, InfoWars.com on the right arm
[59:27.760 --> 59:30.760]  I mean that's a great way just to meet like minded people
[59:30.760 --> 59:33.760]  and spread the word and also exercise free speech
[59:33.760 --> 59:36.760]  and the newest one is trigger warning t-shirt
[59:36.760 --> 59:40.760]  trigger warning t-shirt which is the symbol of a trigger
[59:40.760 --> 59:43.760]  with a yield sign and then InfoWars.com on the back
[59:43.760 --> 59:45.760]  that is the new shirt of the month
[59:45.760 --> 59:51.760]  available exclusively at InfoWars.com
[01:00:15.760 --> 01:00:19.760]  From the front lines of the Information Roar
[01:00:19.760 --> 01:00:21.760]  it's Alex Jones
[01:00:37.760 --> 01:00:40.760]  We are back live, we have former prosecutor
[01:00:40.760 --> 01:00:43.760]  and of course syndicated talk show host Lionel joining us
[01:00:43.760 --> 01:00:47.760]  I saw him this morning on the
[01:00:47.760 --> 01:00:49.760]  Real News with David Knight, very powerful info
[01:00:49.760 --> 01:00:52.760]  so I thought wow come back on this show and please recap what you were just saying
[01:00:52.760 --> 01:00:54.760]  he's coming up at the bottom of the hour
[01:00:54.760 --> 01:00:57.760]  we have some excerpts of and C-Span
[01:00:57.760 --> 01:01:00.760]  but also with us yesterday with Congressman Gates
[01:01:00.760 --> 01:01:04.760]  that's coming up dealing with some really serious issues in the memo
[01:01:04.760 --> 01:01:08.760]  and then other incredible news like inside the bizarre world of human
[01:01:08.760 --> 01:01:12.760]  chimp hybrids known as humanzies as a renowned scientist
[01:01:12.760 --> 01:01:15.760]  who gets into the base in Georgia and other areas
[01:01:15.760 --> 01:01:17.760]  where they've been developing these
[01:01:17.760 --> 01:01:20.760]  and this is 50 year old technology
[01:01:20.760 --> 01:01:24.760]  just like you can have a horse and a zebra can have a baby
[01:01:24.760 --> 01:01:27.760]  or a donkey and a horse can have a mule
[01:01:27.760 --> 01:01:30.760]  or a lion and a tiger can have a liger
[01:01:30.760 --> 01:01:33.760]  it's a little bit harder to do but they're able to do it
[01:01:33.760 --> 01:01:37.760]  and the argument is do they have more rights than a chimpanzee
[01:01:37.760 --> 01:01:39.760]  and the reason this is such an important story is
[01:01:39.760 --> 01:01:42.760]  this is how they take things that are going on
[01:01:42.760 --> 01:01:45.760]  but never really talk about it in the media
[01:01:45.760 --> 01:01:49.760]  and so people think it's a conspiracy theory
[01:01:49.760 --> 01:01:51.760]  it's one of the big things I get attacked for
[01:01:51.760 --> 01:01:53.760]  I mean for 30 years they admit they have animal human hybrids
[01:01:53.760 --> 01:01:55.760]  they kill at the embryonic level
[01:01:55.760 --> 01:01:56.760]  well they've been keeping them alive
[01:01:56.760 --> 01:01:58.760]  it's not just humanzies
[01:01:58.760 --> 01:02:00.760]  so I'm gonna be talking about that too
[01:02:00.760 --> 01:02:03.760]  before I go any further though
[01:02:03.760 --> 01:02:06.760]  earlier I tried to mention this and tried to get into this
[01:02:06.760 --> 01:02:09.760]  and I didn't really give it any justice
[01:02:09.760 --> 01:02:11.760]  so I'm gonna do that right now
[01:02:11.760 --> 01:02:13.760]  because it's such a big deal
[01:02:13.760 --> 01:02:19.760]  this is the best deal we've ever offered on our flagship product
[01:02:19.760 --> 01:02:21.760]  DNA force
[01:02:21.760 --> 01:02:24.760]  this product has been out for three and a half years
[01:02:24.760 --> 01:02:28.760]  it has thousands of five star reviews unprecedented
[01:02:28.760 --> 01:02:30.760]  and it's got a very interesting story behind it
[01:02:30.760 --> 01:02:34.760]  I was at a medical doctor's clinic facility
[01:02:34.760 --> 01:02:36.760]  that had top-of-the-line nutraceuticals
[01:02:36.760 --> 01:02:39.760]  and I was then also on an airplane
[01:02:39.760 --> 01:02:45.760]  was reading about similar formulas to DNA force
[01:02:45.760 --> 01:02:49.760]  and was noticing that they were $200 to $400
[01:02:49.760 --> 01:02:51.760]  and then I talked to my dad about it
[01:02:51.760 --> 01:02:53.760]  who is a physician
[01:02:53.760 --> 01:02:55.760]  and he said absolutely this is the biggest area
[01:02:55.760 --> 01:03:01.760]  in nutraceuticals and supplements is longevity
[01:03:01.760 --> 01:03:04.760]  and keeping your telomeres in place
[01:03:04.760 --> 01:03:06.760]  you can't make telomeres grow
[01:03:06.760 --> 01:03:08.760]  you can just make them not shrink as fast
[01:03:08.760 --> 01:03:11.760]  which is basically I guess kind of the same thing
[01:03:11.760 --> 01:03:13.760]  in the final equation
[01:03:13.760 --> 01:03:16.760]  you can again slow down what's happening with them
[01:03:16.760 --> 01:03:20.760]  it's got nerve regrowth factor you name it
[01:03:20.760 --> 01:03:23.760]  well I designed DNA force with Dr. Group
[01:03:23.760 --> 01:03:25.760]  and Dr. Group's a great guy
[01:03:25.760 --> 01:03:27.760]  but then we were gonna come out with cell force
[01:03:27.760 --> 01:03:29.760]  because I was able to find just as good
[01:03:29.760 --> 01:03:31.760]  backgrounds for a lower price
[01:03:31.760 --> 01:03:33.760]  and was able to develop cell force
[01:03:33.760 --> 01:03:36.760]  and Group liked the formulas so much
[01:03:36.760 --> 01:03:37.760]  he said listen
[01:03:37.760 --> 01:03:39.760]  we were gonna come out with DNA force plus
[01:03:39.760 --> 01:03:41.760]  you just use that name and do it
[01:03:41.760 --> 01:03:43.760]  because this is such an incredible formula
[01:03:43.760 --> 01:03:46.760]  and I understand you're going to one of the biggest labs in the country
[01:03:46.760 --> 01:03:49.760]  and so you were able to scale up in the lower price
[01:03:49.760 --> 01:03:50.760]  and I want to do that
[01:03:50.760 --> 01:03:51.760]  he was so classy
[01:03:51.760 --> 01:03:54.760]  he just said you just put out DNA force plus
[01:03:54.760 --> 01:03:57.760]  as cell force or vice versa
[01:03:57.760 --> 01:03:59.760]  because I was partnering with him on that
[01:03:59.760 --> 01:04:00.760]  that's how classy he is
[01:04:00.760 --> 01:04:02.760]  so cell force is a limited run
[01:04:02.760 --> 01:04:05.760]  when it's gone it's gone
[01:04:05.760 --> 01:04:08.760]  it will be called DNA force plus
[01:04:08.760 --> 01:04:10.760]  because it's stronger than the old DNA force
[01:04:10.760 --> 01:04:13.760]  and it is less money
[01:04:13.760 --> 01:04:16.760]  so it's a good deal normally at $149
[01:04:16.760 --> 01:04:17.760]  like DNA force was
[01:04:17.760 --> 01:04:19.760]  and we'd sell it for $99 on sale
[01:04:19.760 --> 01:04:22.760]  we're selling it for $70.45
[01:04:22.760 --> 01:04:26.760]  that's almost what it cost to make a bottle of DNA force
[01:04:26.760 --> 01:04:28.760]  well now we've lowered the price
[01:04:28.760 --> 01:04:30.760]  on the ingredients by buying even more
[01:04:30.760 --> 01:04:33.760]  just as high quality we're lowering it for you
[01:04:33.760 --> 01:04:35.760]  this is the best deal ever on DNA force
[01:04:35.760 --> 01:04:38.760]  it's DNA force plus but called cell force
[01:04:38.760 --> 01:04:40.760]  because we weren't going to step on group's toes
[01:04:40.760 --> 01:04:42.760]  we just put out cell force separately
[01:04:42.760 --> 01:04:44.760]  with a similar name to DNA force
[01:04:44.760 --> 01:04:46.760]  and it's even stronger and a lower price
[01:04:46.760 --> 01:04:47.760]  super high quality
[01:04:47.760 --> 01:04:49.760]  promotes cellular energy production
[01:04:49.760 --> 01:04:51.760]  supports optimal mental health and so much more
[01:04:51.760 --> 01:04:53.760]  and it supports the info war
[01:04:53.760 --> 01:04:56.760]  the best deal ever at infowarstore.com
[01:04:58.760 --> 01:05:00.760]  you know I've got some talking points here
[01:05:00.760 --> 01:05:02.760]  about caveman from infowarslife.com
[01:05:02.760 --> 01:05:04.760]  but instead of going with those talking points
[01:05:04.760 --> 01:05:06.760]  let me just give you what I've experienced personally
[01:05:06.760 --> 01:05:08.760]  from all the wives tales in every culture
[01:05:08.760 --> 01:05:11.760]  we know that the bones have the essence
[01:05:11.760 --> 01:05:12.760]  we know chicken noodle soup
[01:05:12.760 --> 01:05:14.760]  it's great for people that are sick
[01:05:14.760 --> 01:05:16.760]  again in every culture this has been reported
[01:05:16.760 --> 01:05:18.760]  because it works
[01:05:18.760 --> 01:05:21.760]  and there's no way to quantify
[01:05:21.760 --> 01:05:24.760]  how strong this is but the amount of bone protein
[01:05:24.760 --> 01:05:26.760]  and the amount of marrow
[01:05:26.760 --> 01:05:29.760]  and the amount of concentrated life force
[01:05:29.760 --> 01:05:31.760]  that is in this is incredible
[01:05:31.760 --> 01:05:34.760]  ladies and gentlemen whether it's for your joints
[01:05:34.760 --> 01:05:36.760]  whether it's for your arteries and your veins
[01:05:36.760 --> 01:05:38.760]  whether it's for your brain
[01:05:38.760 --> 01:05:39.760]  whether it's for energy
[01:05:39.760 --> 01:05:41.760]  this ladies and gentlemen
[01:05:41.760 --> 01:05:44.760]  is the strongest, most concentrated
[01:05:44.760 --> 01:05:46.760]  bone broth formula out there
[01:05:46.760 --> 01:05:47.760]  and it's amazing

[01:05:54.760 --> 01:06:20.760]  and for funding the information war in 2018
[01:06:24.760 --> 01:06:27.760]  we are back live now into hour number two
[01:06:27.760 --> 01:06:29.760]  thank you so much for joining us
[01:06:29.760 --> 01:06:31.760]  the wheels are coming off
[01:06:31.760 --> 01:06:32.760]  the walls are closing in
[01:06:32.760 --> 01:06:34.760]  the engine of globalism
[01:06:34.760 --> 01:06:35.760]  it has blown up
[01:06:35.760 --> 01:06:37.760]  I've got a stack of articles I'm going to get to here
[01:06:37.760 --> 01:06:39.760]  in a few minutes
[01:06:39.760 --> 01:06:41.760]  if I can find them in the stack
[01:06:41.760 --> 01:06:42.760]  I was looking during the break
[01:06:42.760 --> 01:06:44.760]  where just all across Europe
[01:06:44.760 --> 01:06:48.760]  they've had 11 elections
[01:06:48.760 --> 01:06:51.760]  in the last two years
[01:06:51.760 --> 01:06:53.760]  and in every country
[01:06:53.760 --> 01:06:56.760]  the populace, the nationalist, the anti-globalist
[01:06:56.760 --> 01:06:58.760]  the free marketers, the libertarians
[01:06:58.760 --> 01:07:01.760]  the conservatives have won
[01:07:01.760 --> 01:07:03.760]  and really the trailblazer of all this
[01:07:03.760 --> 01:07:05.760]  was Berlusconi
[01:07:05.760 --> 01:07:07.760]  and that's why we've got joining us
[01:07:07.760 --> 01:07:11.760]  coming up in the third hour
[01:07:11.760 --> 01:07:13.760]  Leo Zagami
[01:07:13.760 --> 01:07:14.760]  because he was the guy
[01:07:14.760 --> 01:07:17.760]  when I was in Rome a few years ago
[01:07:17.760 --> 01:07:19.760]  who really explained to me
[01:07:19.760 --> 01:07:22.760]  that it was Berlusconi
[01:07:22.760 --> 01:07:25.760]  that advised Putin on nationalism
[01:07:25.760 --> 01:07:27.760]  and a bunch of other issues
[01:07:27.760 --> 01:07:29.760]  not taking away from Putin
[01:07:29.760 --> 01:07:31.760]  and then it was Berlusconi pushing
[01:07:31.760 --> 01:07:34.760]  nationalism all over Europe
[01:07:34.760 --> 01:07:36.760]  and then it was Berlusconi
[01:07:36.760 --> 01:07:38.760]  it would be the model of the new populism
[01:07:38.760 --> 01:07:40.760]  that would sweep the planet
[01:07:40.760 --> 01:07:42.760]  and I saw mainstream articles today
[01:07:42.760 --> 01:07:44.760]  admitting basically that
[01:07:44.760 --> 01:07:47.760]  so I got to tell you I really respect Zagami
[01:07:47.760 --> 01:07:50.760]  I used to think 10 years ago he was nuts
[01:07:50.760 --> 01:07:52.760]  when I first learned about him
[01:07:52.760 --> 01:07:54.760]  just because it sounded so crazy
[01:07:54.760 --> 01:07:56.760]  you know the pedophile rings in the Vatican
[01:07:56.760 --> 01:07:58.760]  we're going to put a black pope in
[01:07:58.760 --> 01:08:00.760]  by black pope of Jesuit
[01:08:00.760 --> 01:08:02.760]  and then it would probably be this current pope
[01:08:02.760 --> 01:08:04.760]  they'd never had a Jesuit before
[01:08:04.760 --> 01:08:06.760]  it was a pope
[01:08:06.760 --> 01:08:08.760]  it's not officially a canon
[01:08:08.760 --> 01:08:10.760]  that it's illegal but you don't do it
[01:08:10.760 --> 01:08:12.760]  because it's the protectionary group
[01:08:12.760 --> 01:08:14.760]  supposedly society of Jesus
[01:08:14.760 --> 01:08:16.760]  set up by Loyola
[01:08:16.760 --> 01:08:18.760]  500 years ago so how is that then
[01:08:18.760 --> 01:08:20.760]  it was the Praetorian Guard
[01:08:20.760 --> 01:08:22.760]  then how is it going to have a pope
[01:08:22.760 --> 01:08:24.760]  that's a conflict of interest
[01:08:24.760 --> 01:08:26.760]  so you've got this admitted Marxist Jesuit now
[01:08:26.760 --> 01:08:28.760]  they used blackmail to get control
[01:08:28.760 --> 01:08:30.760]  of the Vatican
[01:08:30.760 --> 01:08:32.760]  and that even came out in the Guardian
[01:08:32.760 --> 01:08:34.760]  years after Zagami first broke it down
[01:08:34.760 --> 01:08:36.760]  now there it is he's back how
[01:08:36.760 --> 01:08:38.760]  Silvio Berlusconi staged a political
[01:08:38.760 --> 01:08:40.760]  resurrection
[01:08:40.760 --> 01:08:42.760]  they say he's a bad guy
[01:08:42.760 --> 01:08:44.760]  because he likes 25 year old supermodels
[01:08:44.760 --> 01:08:46.760]  hey man he's not a pedophile
[01:08:46.760 --> 01:08:48.760]  you know what I mean that's his big crime
[01:08:48.760 --> 01:08:50.760]  he likes women he's got a bunch of kids
[01:08:50.760 --> 01:08:52.760]  so it's Trump's crime it's my crime
[01:08:52.760 --> 01:08:54.760]  I admit to it
[01:08:56.760 --> 01:08:58.760]  anyways the bottom line here is
[01:08:58.760 --> 01:09:00.760]  that
[01:09:00.760 --> 01:09:02.760]  a lot of crazy things are going on right now
[01:09:02.760 --> 01:09:04.760]  and
[01:09:04.760 --> 01:09:06.760]  we're chronicling this as an unfolds
[01:09:06.760 --> 01:09:08.760]  they had another election in the Czech Republic
[01:09:08.760 --> 01:09:10.760]  just went to the nationalist
[01:09:10.760 --> 01:09:12.760]  when I say 11 or 12
[01:09:12.760 --> 01:09:14.760]  there's been a bunch of special elections
[01:09:14.760 --> 01:09:16.760]  and a bunch of parliamentary
[01:09:16.760 --> 01:09:18.760]  that I can't even keep track there's been like
[01:09:18.760 --> 01:09:20.760]  five in Germany the populace have won
[01:09:20.760 --> 01:09:22.760]  every one of those but Merkel had this coalition
[01:09:22.760 --> 01:09:24.760]  such a monopoly like 80 plus
[01:09:24.760 --> 01:09:26.760]  percent of the votes that it took
[01:09:26.760 --> 01:09:28.760]  five elections to have her
[01:09:28.760 --> 01:09:30.760]  down to she was going to be out of
[01:09:30.760 --> 01:09:32.760]  office but then they did some other deals
[01:09:32.760 --> 01:09:34.760]  when you know when you got a dozen or more big
[01:09:34.760 --> 01:09:36.760]  parties to where she's
[01:09:36.760 --> 01:09:38.760]  still hanging on but yeah pro-Trump
[01:09:38.760 --> 01:09:40.760]  Czech president who warned of organized
[01:09:40.760 --> 01:09:42.760]  invasion of migrants wins re-election
[01:09:42.760 --> 01:09:44.760]  and and then
[01:09:44.760 --> 01:09:46.760]  again the same thing
[01:09:46.760 --> 01:09:48.760]  in Austria the same thing in Spain
[01:09:48.760 --> 01:09:50.760]  the same thing in Greece the same thing
[01:09:50.760 --> 01:09:52.760]  in Italy the same thing
[01:09:52.760 --> 01:09:54.760]  in Iceland the same thing
[01:09:54.760 --> 01:09:56.760]  in England on and on and on
[01:09:56.760 --> 01:09:58.760]  and on and on this is
[01:09:58.760 --> 01:10:00.760]  so exciting
[01:10:02.760 --> 01:10:04.760]  but moving along into
[01:10:04.760 --> 01:10:06.760]  what I want to recap here
[01:10:06.760 --> 01:10:08.760]  we have
[01:10:08.760 --> 01:10:10.760]  MSNBC so-called analysts
[01:10:10.760 --> 01:10:12.760]  basically saying
[01:10:12.760 --> 01:10:14.760]  representative
[01:10:14.760 --> 01:10:16.760]  Nunez must be a Russian
[01:10:16.760 --> 01:10:18.760]  agent
[01:10:18.760 --> 01:10:20.760]  because he doesn't want an illegal
[01:10:20.760 --> 01:10:22.760]  Clinton cabal
[01:10:22.760 --> 01:10:24.760]  caught red-handed inside the Justice Department
[01:10:24.760 --> 01:10:26.760]  FBI making up fake intelligence
[01:10:26.760 --> 01:10:28.760]  to try to overthrow a sitting president
[01:10:28.760 --> 01:10:30.760]  and stop an American recovery I mean you guys
[01:10:30.760 --> 01:10:32.760]  are the ones that have been
[01:10:32.760 --> 01:10:34.760]  financed by George Soros and others and get
[01:10:34.760 --> 01:10:36.760]  taxpayer money and are selling us out to
[01:10:36.760 --> 01:10:38.760]  globalists you're the ones that are the foreign power
[01:10:38.760 --> 01:10:40.760]  here's that clip
[01:10:40.760 --> 01:10:42.760]  possible that the Republican
[01:10:42.760 --> 01:10:44.760]  chairman of the House Intel Committee has been
[01:10:44.760 --> 01:10:46.760]  compromised by the Russians is it possible
[01:10:46.760 --> 01:10:48.760]  they actually have a Russian agent running
[01:10:48.760 --> 01:10:50.760]  the House Intel Committee on the Republican side
[01:10:50.760 --> 01:10:52.760]  I hope that's not the case
[01:10:52.760 --> 01:10:54.760]  I certainly have no information to suggest
[01:10:54.760 --> 01:10:56.760]  that it is
[01:10:56.760 --> 01:10:58.760]  I think that there are- doesn't his behavior
[01:10:58.760 --> 01:11:00.760]  speak of that though I mean I'm not the first person who's raised this
[01:11:00.760 --> 01:11:02.760]  he's behaving like someone who's
[01:11:02.760 --> 01:11:04.760]  been compromised and there are people in the intelligence
[01:11:04.760 --> 01:11:06.760]  committee in the intelligence community
[01:11:06.760 --> 01:11:08.760]  and others with great expertise in this area
[01:11:08.760 --> 01:11:10.760]  who look at him and say
[01:11:10.760 --> 01:11:12.760]  that guy's been compromised
[01:11:12.760 --> 01:11:14.760]  well I don't have that expertise what I also know
[01:11:14.760 --> 01:11:16.760]  is that there are plenty of Republicans who simply
[01:11:16.760 --> 01:11:18.760]  instinctually act
[01:11:18.760 --> 01:11:20.760]  in a way to protect
[01:11:20.760 --> 01:11:22.760]  their president and his actions
[01:11:22.760 --> 01:11:24.760]  would certainly
[01:11:24.760 --> 01:11:26.760]  Okay let's stop right there with these guys
[01:11:26.760 --> 01:11:28.760]  I mean
[01:11:30.760 --> 01:11:32.760]  it's like Monty Python a witch a witch
[01:11:32.760 --> 01:11:34.760]  a witch how do we know
[01:11:34.760 --> 01:11:36.760]  a witch well if we throw her in the water
[01:11:36.760 --> 01:11:38.760]  and she floats we know she's a witch
[01:11:38.760 --> 01:11:40.760]  because witches are made of wood
[01:11:40.760 --> 01:11:42.760]  but if she sinks and dies we know
[01:11:42.760 --> 01:11:44.760]  she's not a witch
[01:11:44.760 --> 01:11:46.760]  but either way she dies good good
[01:11:46.760 --> 01:11:48.760]  throw in the water witch witch witch
[01:11:48.760 --> 01:11:50.760]  and then there's no way to get out of it
[01:11:50.760 --> 01:11:52.760]  it's like admit you
[01:11:52.760 --> 01:11:54.760]  murder penguins
[01:11:54.760 --> 01:11:56.760]  on blue moons and you're just like
[01:11:56.760 --> 01:11:58.760]  I can't prove I don't murder penguins
[01:11:58.760 --> 01:12:00.760]  on blue moons
[01:12:00.760 --> 01:12:02.760]  and certainly we're about to have a blue moon
[01:12:02.760 --> 01:12:04.760]  the next month they're saying
[01:12:04.760 --> 01:12:06.760]  rare rare occurrence and it just goes
[01:12:06.760 --> 01:12:08.760]  on and on and on and on and then they
[01:12:08.760 --> 01:12:10.760]  they say
[01:12:10.760 --> 01:12:12.760]  everyone on
[01:12:12.760 --> 01:12:14.760]  Twitter that's pro-trump is a Russian bot
[01:12:14.760 --> 01:12:16.760]  and then companies do analysis and say none of
[01:12:16.760 --> 01:12:18.760]  these are Russian bots
[01:12:18.760 --> 01:12:20.760]  shift doesn't care he's leveling
[01:12:20.760 --> 01:12:22.760]  his dirty finger at all
[01:12:22.760 --> 01:12:24.760]  of you and saying you're Russian agents
[01:12:24.760 --> 01:12:26.760]  because again they're the outside globalist power
[01:12:26.760 --> 01:12:28.760]  speaking of Nancy
[01:12:28.760 --> 01:12:30.760]  Pelosi already pledged the clips of her total meltdown
[01:12:30.760 --> 01:12:32.760]  with Cuomo
[01:12:32.760 --> 01:12:34.760]  and they are so scared of the memo
[01:12:34.760 --> 01:12:36.760]  and notice they've gone from saying it's not real
[01:12:36.760 --> 01:12:38.760]  there's nothing there to don't release it oh no
[01:12:38.760 --> 01:12:40.760]  whatever you do don't release it because it is so
[01:12:40.760 --> 01:12:42.760]  damning everything else we've already seen
[01:12:42.760 --> 01:12:44.760]  has been damning reportedly this is like
[01:12:44.760 --> 01:12:46.760]  dozens more quotes this is bad
[01:12:46.760 --> 01:12:48.760]  red-handed organized
[01:12:48.760 --> 01:12:50.760]  collusion
[01:12:50.760 --> 01:12:52.760]  they already admit there's clips of
[01:12:52.760 --> 01:12:54.760]  stroke stroke saying oh my god
[01:12:54.760 --> 01:12:56.760]  there's no Russian collusion what are we gonna do
[01:12:56.760 --> 01:12:58.760]  we're gonna get caught
[01:12:58.760 --> 01:13:00.760]  and they're talking about violence against the president
[01:13:00.760 --> 01:13:02.760]  I mean this is going to be
[01:13:02.760 --> 01:13:04.760]  devastating
[01:13:04.760 --> 01:13:06.760]  devastating
[01:13:06.760 --> 01:13:08.760]  and I'm telling you
[01:13:08.760 --> 01:13:10.760]  I feel it my gut they're gonna pull something
[01:13:10.760 --> 01:13:12.760]  that they just are cornered rats they're used to
[01:13:12.760 --> 01:13:14.760]  being in power they want to stay in power
[01:13:14.760 --> 01:13:16.760]  but here's Pelosi preemptively
[01:13:16.760 --> 01:13:18.760]  disapproves of all the president
[01:13:18.760 --> 01:13:20.760]  Trump's state of the union
[01:13:20.760 --> 01:13:22.760]  talking points she preemptively tries
[01:13:22.760 --> 01:13:24.760]  to drive the economy down she preemptively
[01:13:24.760 --> 01:13:26.760]  pushes all this bull we're gonna play that clip
[01:13:26.760 --> 01:13:28.760]  and then Michael Morris says America
[01:13:28.760 --> 01:13:30.760]  must be cleansed of its white male privileges
[01:13:30.760 --> 01:13:32.760]  total racism
[01:13:32.760 --> 01:13:34.760]  total race mating that's all they've got
[01:13:36.760 --> 01:13:38.760]  this is KKK behavior
[01:13:38.760 --> 01:13:40.760]  because demographically whites
[01:13:40.760 --> 01:13:42.760]  like the democratic party that use KKK
[01:13:42.760 --> 01:13:44.760]  control before they've just shifted
[01:13:44.760 --> 01:13:46.760]  the demographic and think minorities who
[01:13:46.760 --> 01:13:48.760]  become the majority as we speak will
[01:13:48.760 --> 01:13:50.760]  become basically Hispanic and black
[01:13:50.760 --> 01:13:52.760]  KKK and they don't want
[01:13:52.760 --> 01:13:54.760]  prosperity they don't want a future they just want
[01:13:54.760 --> 01:13:56.760]  to be racist idiots led around by
[01:13:56.760 --> 01:13:58.760]  weird old people who can hardly talk
[01:13:58.760 --> 01:14:00.760]  by Nancy Pelosi instead of having prosperity
[01:14:00.760 --> 01:14:02.760]  living together in peace I mean this is insane
[01:14:02.760 --> 01:14:04.760]  so here is Nancy Pelosi
[01:14:04.760 --> 01:14:06.760]  when the president comes to make
[01:14:06.760 --> 01:14:08.760]  the state of the union address he will
[01:14:08.760 --> 01:14:10.760]  try to characterize
[01:14:10.760 --> 01:14:12.760]  his initiatives as something
[01:14:12.760 --> 01:14:14.760]  positive but 2017
[01:14:14.760 --> 01:14:16.760]  was a very bad year for the American people
[01:14:16.760 --> 01:14:18.760]  because of the failure on
[01:14:18.760 --> 01:14:20.760]  the part of the republican thing congress
[01:14:20.760 --> 01:14:22.760]  to get the job done
[01:14:22.760 --> 01:14:24.760]  they have failed I give them an F
[01:14:24.760 --> 01:14:26.760]  the republican tax scam
[01:14:26.760 --> 01:14:28.760]  has trouble in store for
[01:14:28.760 --> 01:14:30.760]  Trump has had incredible success
[01:14:30.760 --> 01:14:32.760]  we've all had success
[01:14:32.760 --> 01:14:34.760]  she's demoralizing him
[01:14:34.760 --> 01:14:36.760]  6 million middle class families will pay more
[01:14:36.760 --> 01:14:38.760]  taxes
[01:14:38.760 --> 01:14:40.760]  the globalists wrote the laws with their tax exempt
[01:14:40.760 --> 01:14:42.760]  Bezos and all these people that get taxpayer
[01:14:42.760 --> 01:14:44.760]  money on every order they're all
[01:14:44.760 --> 01:14:46.760]  for tax increases they didn't want this
[01:14:46.760 --> 01:14:48.760]  because they don't want you to have anything they want to shut America down
[01:14:48.760 --> 01:14:50.760]  Apple didn't want these cuts
[01:14:50.760 --> 01:14:52.760]  for the general public but they wanted the corporate taxes
[01:14:52.760 --> 01:14:54.760]  to bring some jobs back
[01:14:54.760 --> 01:14:56.760]  because they can then competitively
[01:14:56.760 --> 01:14:58.760]  leverage out China a little bit
[01:14:58.760 --> 01:15:00.760]  the point is
[01:15:00.760 --> 01:15:02.760]  the establishment didn't want these tax cuts
[01:15:02.760 --> 01:15:04.760]  back to Pelosi
[01:15:04.760 --> 01:15:06.760]  this is all for them
[01:15:06.760 --> 01:15:08.760]  but the worst part is
[01:15:08.760 --> 01:15:10.760]  nearly 2 trillion dollars that they've added to the national debt
[01:15:10.760 --> 01:15:12.760]  robbing from our children's
[01:15:12.760 --> 01:15:14.760]  future in order to give
[01:15:14.760 --> 01:15:16.760]  tax breaks to the rich and to corporate America
[01:15:18.760 --> 01:15:20.760]  the democrats have
[01:15:20.760 --> 01:15:22.760]  tripled the money in congress of republicans
[01:15:22.760 --> 01:15:24.760]  they're the rich powerful group, they're the elite
[01:15:24.760 --> 01:15:26.760]  that's the facts, what Trump's doing is $13,000
[01:15:26.760 --> 01:15:28.760]  for the average family
[01:15:28.760 --> 01:15:30.760]  already look at wages going up
[01:15:30.760 --> 01:15:32.760]  let's go out to break with more of her babble
[01:15:32.760 --> 01:15:34.760]  f minus
[01:15:34.760 --> 01:15:36.760]  because he had more opportunities
[01:15:36.760 --> 01:15:38.760]  the president of the united states
[01:15:38.760 --> 01:15:40.760]  so I think he'll take credit for things that didn't happen
[01:15:40.760 --> 01:15:42.760]  or things that happened that he had nothing to do with
[01:15:42.760 --> 01:15:44.760]  oh like if you have a business you didn't build it
[01:15:44.760 --> 01:15:46.760]  misrepresent the facts when it comes to infrastructure
[01:15:46.760 --> 01:15:48.760]  and if you've got a doctor you can keep it
[01:15:48.760 --> 01:15:50.760]  sooner or later
[01:15:50.760 --> 01:16:02.760]  get her off the screen

[01:19:18.760 --> 01:19:22.760]  McCabe's removal comes the day after acting FBI
[01:19:22.760 --> 01:19:24.760]  director Christopher Wray read the FISA memo
[01:19:24.760 --> 01:19:26.760]  on Capitol Hill
[01:19:26.760 --> 01:19:28.760]  and on the day the House votes on its release
[01:19:28.760 --> 01:19:30.760]  though McCabe is set to retire
[01:19:30.760 --> 01:19:32.760]  sometime in March
[01:19:32.760 --> 01:19:34.760]  the timing of this development is pretty peculiar
[01:19:34.760 --> 01:19:36.760]  one source said McCabe was exercising
[01:19:36.760 --> 01:19:38.760]  his retirement eligibility
[01:19:38.760 --> 01:19:40.760]  and characterized his decision as
[01:19:40.760 --> 01:19:42.760]  stepping aside
[01:19:42.760 --> 01:19:44.760]  and McCabe was even taunted on Twitter
[01:19:44.760 --> 01:19:46.760]  by President Trump after news of his retirement
[01:19:46.760 --> 01:19:48.760]  Trump tweeted
[01:19:48.760 --> 01:19:50.760]  FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe
[01:19:50.760 --> 01:19:52.760]  is racing the clock to retire with full benefits
[01:19:52.760 --> 01:19:54.760]  90 days to go
[01:19:54.760 --> 01:20:18.760]  lianmacadooinfowars.com
[01:20:18.760 --> 01:20:22.760]  live from the infowars.com studios
[01:20:22.760 --> 01:20:38.760]  it's alexjones
[01:20:38.760 --> 01:20:40.760]  I love the fact
[01:20:40.760 --> 01:20:42.760]  we're turning the corner against the globalist
[01:20:42.760 --> 01:20:44.760]  stock market's down over 300 points today though
[01:20:44.760 --> 01:20:46.760]  on uncertainty
[01:20:46.760 --> 01:20:48.760]  it's a big big deal when you learn
[01:20:48.760 --> 01:20:50.760]  that the top of the FBI was run by the Clintons
[01:20:50.760 --> 01:20:52.760]  that they were messing with the
[01:20:52.760 --> 01:20:54.760]  media
[01:20:54.760 --> 01:20:56.760]  the Democratic Party
[01:20:56.760 --> 01:20:58.760]  that they were involved in massive collusion
[01:20:58.760 --> 01:21:00.760]  it's a critical article on infowars.com
[01:21:02.760 --> 01:21:04.760]  the FBI director
[01:21:04.760 --> 01:21:06.760]  was removed the day after the Bureau
[01:21:06.760 --> 01:21:08.760]  read the memo from Congress
[01:21:08.760 --> 01:21:10.760]  because it was sent over
[01:21:10.760 --> 01:21:12.760]  to the Justice Department
[01:21:12.760 --> 01:21:14.760]  Friday for their review
[01:21:14.760 --> 01:21:16.760]  and after they had a chance to read it
[01:21:16.760 --> 01:21:18.760]  by Monday
[01:21:18.760 --> 01:21:20.760]  he had to go
[01:21:20.760 --> 01:21:22.760]  that is a critical article
[01:21:22.760 --> 01:21:24.760]  on infowars.com
[01:21:24.760 --> 01:21:26.760]  and continuing
[01:21:26.760 --> 01:21:28.760]  it's being reported by Tucker Carlson and others
[01:21:28.760 --> 01:21:30.760]  that he is under DOJ scrutiny
[01:21:30.760 --> 01:21:32.760]  that means criminal
[01:21:32.760 --> 01:21:34.760]  investigation
[01:21:34.760 --> 01:21:36.760]  so again I ask you the question
[01:21:36.760 --> 01:21:38.760]  everybody should be asking
[01:21:38.760 --> 01:21:40.760]  what are they going to do
[01:21:40.760 --> 01:21:42.760]  because they tried to deny the stuff existed
[01:21:42.760 --> 01:21:44.760]  and they said it was no big deal
[01:21:44.760 --> 01:21:46.760]  now they're scared
[01:21:46.760 --> 01:21:48.760]  now they're saying oh we're going to hurt the country
[01:21:48.760 --> 01:21:50.760]  don't bring this out
[01:21:50.760 --> 01:21:52.760]  well justice be done
[01:21:52.760 --> 01:21:54.760]  may the heavens fall
[01:21:54.760 --> 01:21:56.760]  it has to come out
[01:21:56.760 --> 01:21:58.760]  it has to come out
[01:21:58.760 --> 01:22:00.760]  and quite frankly
[01:22:00.760 --> 01:22:02.760]  we have to end this whole Russia collusion garbage
[01:22:02.760 --> 01:22:04.760]  on the Trump front
[01:22:04.760 --> 01:22:06.760]  because there's no evidence of it just as the FBI
[01:22:06.760 --> 01:22:08.760]  text messages that congress have
[01:22:08.760 --> 01:22:10.760]  says you've got struck telling his girlfriend
[01:22:10.760 --> 01:22:12.760]  man this isn't real
[01:22:12.760 --> 01:22:14.760]  there's nothing here
[01:22:14.760 --> 01:22:16.760]  we need to stop doing this
[01:22:16.760 --> 01:22:18.760]  but we all know McCabe
[01:22:18.760 --> 01:22:20.760]  and others ordered them
[01:22:20.760 --> 01:22:22.760]  to continue
[01:22:22.760 --> 01:22:24.760]  shocked to his core FBI director
[01:22:24.760 --> 01:22:26.760]  Ray blown away
[01:22:26.760 --> 01:22:28.760]  by contents of FISA memo
[01:22:28.760 --> 01:22:30.760]  sources say
[01:22:30.760 --> 01:22:32.760]  more resignations may be coming
[01:22:32.760 --> 01:22:34.760]  and then the media says oh it's because
[01:22:34.760 --> 01:22:36.760]  Trump fired them no
[01:22:36.760 --> 01:22:38.760]  they have been caught
[01:22:38.760 --> 01:22:40.760]  on government phones in a conspiracy
[01:22:40.760 --> 01:22:42.760]  fraud the American voter
[01:22:42.760 --> 01:22:44.760]  and to keep a Clinton cabal
[01:22:44.760 --> 01:22:46.760]  in charge
[01:22:46.760 --> 01:22:48.760]  so they could cover up the crimes they'd previously engaged in
[01:22:48.760 --> 01:22:50.760]  and carry out more in the future
[01:22:50.760 --> 01:22:52.760]  just like a big bank
[01:22:52.760 --> 01:22:54.760]  you'll get the CEO and the CFO together
[01:22:54.760 --> 01:22:56.760]  and you find out they've stolen billions of dollars
[01:22:56.760 --> 01:22:58.760]  like Bernie Madoff
[01:22:58.760 --> 01:23:00.760]  that's how they do this
[01:23:00.760 --> 01:23:02.760]  you get a few people at the top
[01:23:02.760 --> 01:23:04.760]  they can wreck everything and that's exactly
[01:23:04.760 --> 01:23:06.760]  what's happening
[01:23:06.760 --> 01:23:08.760]  the house of cards
[01:23:08.760 --> 01:23:10.760]  coming down on the fake news
[01:23:10.760 --> 01:23:12.760]  on all of these people
[01:23:12.760 --> 01:23:14.760]  that are so incredibly desperate like
[01:23:14.760 --> 01:23:16.760]  Acosta putting out reports
[01:23:16.760 --> 01:23:18.760]  that Trump fired McCabe
[01:23:18.760 --> 01:23:20.760]  yesterday that's not true
[01:23:22.760 --> 01:23:24.760]  right now let's go to a boil down
[01:23:24.760 --> 01:23:26.760]  of Matt Gaetz
[01:23:26.760 --> 01:23:28.760]  on the broadcast one of the
[01:23:28.760 --> 01:23:30.760]  great freshman members of congress
[01:23:30.760 --> 01:23:32.760]  he's up for election this year
[01:23:32.760 --> 01:23:34.760]  just pointing out that these guys
[01:23:34.760 --> 01:23:36.760]  are like cornered rats he put a press release
[01:23:36.760 --> 01:23:38.760]  out today saying the president should release
[01:23:38.760 --> 01:23:40.760]  the memo at the state of the union
[01:23:40.760 --> 01:23:42.760]  imagine if you didn't talk about any up until the end
[01:23:42.760 --> 01:23:44.760]  and said the public has the right
[01:23:44.760 --> 01:23:46.760]  to know this there was a criminal conspiracy
[01:23:46.760 --> 01:23:48.760]  by Hillary and the Democrats
[01:23:48.760 --> 01:23:50.760]  to try to keep me from getting into office
[01:23:50.760 --> 01:23:52.760]  so we wouldn't have this recovery they're globalist
[01:23:52.760 --> 01:23:54.760]  they've sold you out
[01:23:54.760 --> 01:23:56.760]  it would devastate them but I think the president's
[01:23:56.760 --> 01:23:58.760]  going to take the high road but I agree with Gaetz
[01:23:58.760 --> 01:24:00.760]  I think we should go both barrels
[01:24:00.760 --> 01:24:02.760]  and this should be released
[01:24:02.760 --> 01:24:04.760]  but here's some of the powerful excerpts
[01:24:04.760 --> 01:24:06.760]  from yesterday's interview
[01:24:06.760 --> 01:24:08.760]  what happens as their house of cards falls
[01:24:08.760 --> 01:24:10.760]  they've shown they never give up
[01:24:10.760 --> 01:24:12.760]  well you're right about that Alex
[01:24:12.760 --> 01:24:14.760]  but they're going to be like cornered rats
[01:24:14.760 --> 01:24:16.760]  when this entire investigation
[01:24:16.760 --> 01:24:18.760]  is shown to be the fraud that it is
[01:24:18.760 --> 01:24:20.760]  it's built on a rotten foundation
[01:24:20.760 --> 01:24:22.760]  and I suspect that they'll have to go
[01:24:22.760 --> 01:24:24.760]  into major defense mode
[01:24:24.760 --> 01:24:26.760]  over Hillary Clinton and the Clinton Foundation
[01:24:26.760 --> 01:24:28.760]  there's a lot of people that paid bribes
[01:24:28.760 --> 01:24:30.760]  to the Clinton Foundation
[01:24:30.760 --> 01:24:32.760]  that still may be getting a benefit
[01:24:32.760 --> 01:24:34.760]  but they find out that their house of cards
[01:24:34.760 --> 01:24:36.760]  is falling we may see a very strong reaction
[01:24:36.760 --> 01:24:38.760]  and they'll have to really start to
[01:24:38.760 --> 01:24:40.760]  explain themselves because the president
[01:24:40.760 --> 01:24:42.760]  has shown one thing he's willing to drain the swamp
[01:24:42.760 --> 01:24:44.760]  in this town. State of the Union
[01:24:44.760 --> 01:24:46.760]  we've seen year one about delivering
[01:24:46.760 --> 01:24:48.760]  Trump says hey I've just got it started
[01:24:48.760 --> 01:24:50.760]  what do you expect to hear in the State of the Union
[01:24:50.760 --> 01:24:52.760]  tomorrow night?
[01:24:52.760 --> 01:24:54.760]  I expect the president to offer a unifying
[01:24:54.760 --> 01:24:56.760]  message I expect a real focus on
[01:24:56.760 --> 01:24:58.760]  infrastructure and about the economic
[01:24:58.760 --> 01:25:00.760]  conditions people find themselves in
[01:25:00.760 --> 01:25:02.760]  because the mainstream media can lie
[01:25:02.760 --> 01:25:04.760]  and they can cheat and they can distort
[01:25:04.760 --> 01:25:06.760]  and they can take things out of context
[01:25:06.760 --> 01:25:08.760]  and sensationalize all kind of drama
[01:25:08.760 --> 01:25:10.760]  that goes on here in Washington
[01:25:10.760 --> 01:25:12.760]  but what the mainstream media can't lie about
[01:25:12.760 --> 01:25:14.760]  is the amount of money in people's paychecks
[01:25:14.760 --> 01:25:16.760]  and I think that the president is going to talk
[01:25:16.760 --> 01:25:18.760]  to over 2 million Americans
[01:25:18.760 --> 01:25:20.760]  that have already seen their wages rise
[01:25:20.760 --> 01:25:22.760]  they've already seen bonuses in their bank accounts
[01:25:22.760 --> 01:25:24.760]  and he's going to talk about the economic
[01:25:24.760 --> 01:25:26.760]  condition of this of the American people
[01:25:26.760 --> 01:25:28.760]  and I think ultimately
[01:25:28.760 --> 01:25:30.760]  that will unify our party and it should
[01:25:30.760 --> 01:25:32.760]  unify the country. That's right
[01:25:32.760 --> 01:25:34.760]  it's a really question of the people are awake
[01:25:34.760 --> 01:25:36.760]  they should deliver and take action. I've got to ask this last question
[01:25:36.760 --> 01:25:38.760]  I know you're not a vindictive guy and neither am I
[01:25:38.760 --> 01:25:40.760]  Napoleon got you know sent off to Alba
[01:25:40.760 --> 01:25:42.760]  but Hillary and the globalists have committed all these crimes
[01:25:42.760 --> 01:25:44.760]  there should be more investigations
[01:25:44.760 --> 01:25:46.760]  something should be done they're always going to come back
[01:25:46.760 --> 01:25:48.760]  if we don't is somebody going to get indicted
[01:25:48.760 --> 01:25:50.760]  over the made up Russiagate crimes
[01:25:50.760 --> 01:25:52.760]  trying to frustrate voters
[01:25:52.760 --> 01:25:54.760]  and all the crazy stuff we've seen
[01:25:54.760 --> 01:25:56.760]  I mean you know the money
[01:25:56.760 --> 01:25:58.760]  the former FBI director
[01:25:58.760 --> 01:26:00.760]  McCabe's wife getting a half million
[01:26:00.760 --> 01:26:02.760]  the president has talked about it what needs to happen
[01:26:02.760 --> 01:26:04.760]  just in closing. Well there have been incredible
[01:26:04.760 --> 01:26:06.760]  media reports that the Little Rock field
[01:26:06.760 --> 01:26:08.760]  office is actually investigating
[01:26:08.760 --> 01:26:10.760]  elements of bribery and corruption
[01:26:10.760 --> 01:26:12.760]  with the Clinton Foundation particularly
[01:26:12.760 --> 01:26:14.760]  as it relates to uranium
[01:26:14.760 --> 01:26:16.760]  sales that may not have
[01:26:16.760 --> 01:26:18.760]  been in our nation's interest and I think that
[01:26:18.760 --> 01:26:20.760]  should really worry Hillary Clinton and some
[01:26:20.760 --> 01:26:22.760]  of the people who were paying money for influence
[01:26:22.760 --> 01:26:24.760]  within the Clinton world because
[01:26:24.760 --> 01:26:26.760]  this is not going to be a politically
[01:26:26.760 --> 01:26:28.760]  predetermined outcome
[01:26:28.760 --> 01:26:30.760]  made by a bunch of political bureaucrats
[01:26:30.760 --> 01:26:32.760]  at the head shed at the FBI
[01:26:32.760 --> 01:26:34.760]  this is going to be front-line work done by
[01:26:34.760 --> 01:26:36.760]  real field agents out in the Little Rock
[01:26:36.760 --> 01:26:38.760]  field office and they should be concerned
[01:26:38.760 --> 01:26:40.760]  because justice may be coming to their doorstep
[01:26:40.760 --> 01:26:42.760]  very soon. Wow so it looks
[01:26:42.760 --> 01:26:44.760]  like Clinton world is coming
[01:26:44.760 --> 01:26:46.760]  to an end as America and the real world
[01:26:46.760 --> 01:26:48.760]  comes back well Matt Gaetz
[01:26:48.760 --> 01:26:50.760]  really impressed with what you're doing Matt Gaetz.com
[01:26:50.760 --> 01:26:52.760]  thanks for joining us here in the info war.
[01:26:52.760 --> 01:26:54.760]  Thank you.
[01:26:56.760 --> 01:26:58.760]  But how are they
[01:26:58.760 --> 01:27:00.760]  going to strike back now?
[01:27:00.760 --> 01:27:02.760]  What's this establishment going to do? Well it's
[01:27:02.760 --> 01:27:04.760]  in the documents that came out three weeks ago
[01:27:04.760 --> 01:27:06.760]  that have been confirmed now from the Soros
[01:27:06.760 --> 01:27:08.760]  Foundation and is son running it.
[01:27:08.760 --> 01:27:10.760]  They tried to cause race riots in 2015
[01:27:10.760 --> 01:27:12.760]  and tried to trigger
[01:27:12.760 --> 01:27:14.760]  martial law. Let's go ahead
[01:27:14.760 --> 01:27:16.760]  and go to Michael Moore.
[01:27:16.760 --> 01:27:18.760]  We're moving him.
[01:27:18.760 --> 01:27:20.760]  Intense.
[01:27:20.760 --> 01:27:22.760]  And the whole
[01:27:22.760 --> 01:27:24.760]  disgusting one
[01:27:24.760 --> 01:27:26.760]  that in Congress and in our city
[01:27:26.760 --> 01:27:28.760]  panels still won't be
[01:27:28.760 --> 01:27:30.760]  enough. No.
[01:27:30.760 --> 01:27:32.760]  We must remove
[01:27:32.760 --> 01:27:34.760]  and replace
[01:27:34.760 --> 01:27:36.760]  the system
[01:27:36.760 --> 01:27:38.760]  and the culture that gave us trouble
[01:27:38.760 --> 01:27:40.760]  in the first place.
[01:27:40.760 --> 01:27:42.760]  He
[01:27:42.760 --> 01:27:44.760]  did not
[01:27:44.760 --> 01:27:46.760]  just fall
[01:27:46.760 --> 01:27:48.760]  out of the sky
[01:27:48.760 --> 01:27:50.760]  and land in Queens.
[01:27:50.760 --> 01:27:52.760]  He is
[01:27:52.760 --> 01:27:54.760]  the result
[01:27:54.760 --> 01:27:56.760]  of a decades long
[01:27:56.760 --> 01:27:58.760]  corporate takeover
[01:27:58.760 --> 01:28:00.760]  of our democracy.
[01:28:00.760 --> 01:28:02.760]  And
[01:28:02.760 --> 01:28:04.760]  of us
[01:28:04.760 --> 01:28:06.760]  never correcting
[01:28:06.760 --> 01:28:08.760]  the three original sins
[01:28:08.760 --> 01:28:10.760]  of America.
[01:28:10.760 --> 01:28:12.760]  A nation founded
[01:28:12.760 --> 01:28:14.760]  on genocide
[01:28:14.760 --> 01:28:16.760]  built on the backs
[01:28:16.760 --> 01:28:18.760]  of the slaves
[01:28:18.760 --> 01:28:20.760]  and maintained
[01:28:20.760 --> 01:28:22.760]  through the subjugation of women
[01:28:22.760 --> 01:28:24.760]  to second class citizenship
[01:28:24.760 --> 01:28:26.760]  and economic disempowerment.
[01:28:30.760 --> 01:28:32.760]  That's how they got away with it.
[01:28:32.760 --> 01:28:34.760]  And
[01:28:36.760 --> 01:28:38.760]  as we seek to rid ourselves
[01:28:38.760 --> 01:28:40.760]  of Trump
[01:28:40.760 --> 01:28:42.760]  we must also cleanse
[01:28:42.760 --> 01:28:44.760]  our American soul
[01:28:44.760 --> 01:28:46.760]  of its white male privilege
[01:28:46.760 --> 01:28:48.760]  in voracious greed
[01:28:48.760 --> 01:28:50.760]  and its enforced ignorance
[01:28:50.760 --> 01:28:52.760]  that has made
[01:28:52.760 --> 01:28:54.760]  a population of
[01:28:54.760 --> 01:28:56.760]  citizens

[01:33:30.760 --> 01:33:32.760]  for 60 minutes as the designee
[01:33:32.760 --> 01:33:34.760]  of the Majority Leader
[01:33:34.760 --> 01:33:36.760]  Thank you Mr. Speaker
[01:33:36.760 --> 01:33:38.760]  There is a four page memo
[01:33:38.760 --> 01:33:40.760]  I've read it
[01:33:40.760 --> 01:33:42.760]  over 190 of my Republican colleagues have read it
[01:33:42.760 --> 01:33:44.760]  some Democrats have read it
[01:33:44.760 --> 01:33:46.760]  some have boycotted reading it
[01:33:46.760 --> 01:33:48.760]  and it details circumstances
[01:33:48.760 --> 01:33:50.760]  that are deeply troubling to me
[01:33:50.760 --> 01:33:52.760]  and that I believe will be deeply troubling to many Americans
[01:33:52.760 --> 01:33:54.760]  they are going to release the memo
[01:33:54.760 --> 01:33:56.760]  and they're going to make it available to the entire House
[01:33:56.760 --> 01:33:58.760]  that's what they voted on
[01:33:58.760 --> 01:34:00.760]  and now
[01:34:00.760 --> 01:34:02.760]  the memo
[01:34:02.760 --> 01:34:04.760]  goes to President Trump's desk
[01:34:04.760 --> 01:34:06.760]  and now he can confirm
[01:34:06.760 --> 01:34:08.760]  whether or not to release it to the entire public
[01:34:08.760 --> 01:34:10.760]  The House Intelligence Committee
[01:34:10.760 --> 01:34:12.760]  an executive session
[01:34:12.760 --> 01:34:14.760]  the Washington Examiner writing about the
[01:34:14.760 --> 01:34:16.760]  outcome of that meeting saying
[01:34:16.760 --> 01:34:18.760]  the committee voted this evening to force the release
[01:34:18.760 --> 01:34:20.760]  of a classified memo written by Republicans
[01:34:20.760 --> 01:34:22.760]  that outlines what they say are abuses
[01:34:22.760 --> 01:34:24.760]  of federal surveillance authorities
[01:34:24.760 --> 01:34:26.760]  Mr. Speaker
[01:34:26.760 --> 01:34:28.760]  I walked into a secure fault
[01:34:28.760 --> 01:34:30.760]  and signed one of the most detailed
[01:34:30.760 --> 01:34:32.760]  non-disclosure documents I've ever seen
[01:34:32.760 --> 01:34:34.760]  and viewed the memo
[01:34:34.760 --> 01:34:36.760]  and after having reviewed the contents
[01:34:36.760 --> 01:34:38.760]  of the classified memo relating to FISA abuses
[01:34:38.760 --> 01:34:40.760]  I support
[01:34:40.760 --> 01:34:42.760]  its full release to the public
[01:34:42.760 --> 01:34:44.760]  so that they have all of the facts
[01:34:44.760 --> 01:34:46.760]  The American people deserve
[01:34:46.760 --> 01:34:48.760]  to see the information that I have read
[01:34:48.760 --> 01:34:50.760]  that Mr. Gates has read
[01:34:50.760 --> 01:34:52.760]  and that
[01:34:52.760 --> 01:34:54.760]  over a hundred members of Congress
[01:34:54.760 --> 01:34:56.760]  have read
[01:34:56.760 --> 01:34:58.760]  I'm stunned at the previous administration's
[01:34:58.760 --> 01:35:00.760]  underhanded surveillance methods
[01:35:00.760 --> 01:35:02.760]  and misuse of power
[01:35:02.760 --> 01:35:04.760]  at the highest levels of the FBI
[01:35:04.760 --> 01:35:06.760]  and Department of Justice
[01:35:06.760 --> 01:35:08.760]  We have got to have
[01:35:08.760 --> 01:35:10.760]  people in these law enforcement agencies
[01:35:10.760 --> 01:35:12.760]  that lead these agencies in these bodies
[01:35:12.760 --> 01:35:14.760]  be trustworthy
[01:35:14.760 --> 01:35:16.760]  who will follow the law
[01:35:16.760 --> 01:35:18.760]  who will not abuse their power
[01:35:18.760 --> 01:35:20.760]  for
[01:35:20.760 --> 01:35:22.760]  political gain or purpose
[01:35:22.760 --> 01:35:24.760]  Moreover, all federal agencies
[01:35:24.760 --> 01:35:26.760]  including the FBI should be held
[01:35:26.760 --> 01:35:28.760]  to a high standard
[01:35:28.760 --> 01:35:30.760]  and always be held accountable for their actions
[01:35:30.760 --> 01:35:32.760]  The issues that the memo raises
[01:35:32.760 --> 01:35:34.760]  must be brought to light and dealt with responsibly
[01:35:34.760 --> 01:35:36.760]  Yes, we all have a right
[01:35:36.760 --> 01:35:38.760]  to know what is going on
[01:35:38.760 --> 01:35:40.760]  with our government
[01:35:40.760 --> 01:35:42.760]  Yes, I'm worried about
[01:35:42.760 --> 01:35:44.760]  career bureaucrats or elected officials
[01:35:44.760 --> 01:35:46.760]  abusing the power of the government
[01:35:46.760 --> 01:35:48.760]  to get information on their
[01:35:48.760 --> 01:35:50.760]  political enemies
[01:35:50.760 --> 01:35:52.760]  like the king was doing back in the days
[01:35:52.760 --> 01:35:54.760]  of the Revolutionary War
[01:35:54.760 --> 01:35:56.760]  In addition to releasing the memo
[01:35:56.760 --> 01:35:58.760]  I believe it's important
[01:35:58.760 --> 01:36:00.760]  to be releasing relevant material
[01:36:00.760 --> 01:36:02.760]  sourced in the memo
[01:36:02.760 --> 01:36:04.760]  I am looking forward
[01:36:04.760 --> 01:36:06.760]  to President Trump
[01:36:06.760 --> 01:36:08.760]  shortly declassifying
[01:36:08.760 --> 01:36:10.760]  permanently
[01:36:10.760 --> 01:36:12.760]  that memo
[01:36:12.760 --> 01:36:14.760]  is an opportunity
[01:36:14.760 --> 01:36:16.760]  to remind ourselves
[01:36:16.760 --> 01:36:18.760]  that we do have a right
[01:36:18.760 --> 01:36:20.760]  to be safe and secure
[01:36:20.760 --> 01:36:22.760]  in our persons and papers
[01:36:22.760 --> 01:36:24.760]  from a government
[01:36:24.760 --> 01:36:26.760]  that may be trying to do more
[01:36:26.760 --> 01:36:28.760]  than protect us
[01:36:28.760 --> 01:36:30.760]  Maybe some of these folks in the government
[01:36:30.760 --> 01:36:32.760]  have shifted from what we need to protect America
[01:36:32.760 --> 01:36:34.760]  to, well, the best way to protect America
[01:36:34.760 --> 01:36:36.760]  is to protect ourselves
[01:36:36.760 --> 01:36:38.760]  and our job and our political agenda
[01:36:38.760 --> 01:36:40.760]  Let's go back now
[01:36:40.760 --> 01:36:42.760]  to Adam Schiff
[01:36:42.760 --> 01:36:44.760]  crying
[01:36:44.760 --> 01:36:46.760]  freaking out because his fake memo
[01:36:46.760 --> 01:36:48.760]  is not going to be released to the public
[01:36:48.760 --> 01:36:50.760]  We had a separate vote
[01:36:50.760 --> 01:36:52.760]  on the minority memoranda
[01:36:52.760 --> 01:36:54.760]  and the majority voted against
[01:36:54.760 --> 01:36:56.760]  allowing the public to see the minority memoranda
[01:36:56.760 --> 01:36:58.760]  The release the memo
[01:36:58.760 --> 01:37:00.760]  crowd apparently doesn't want to release
[01:37:00.760 --> 01:37:02.760]  the memo now
[01:37:02.760 --> 01:37:04.760]  The House Democrats, led by ranking member
[01:37:04.760 --> 01:37:06.760]  Adam Schiff, went to the House
[01:37:06.760 --> 01:37:08.760]  Intel Committee tonight
[01:37:08.760 --> 01:37:10.760]  asking for the public release
[01:37:10.760 --> 01:37:12.760]  of their memo
[01:37:12.760 --> 01:37:14.760]  asking for their colleagues to
[01:37:14.760 --> 01:37:16.760]  declassify the memo
[01:37:16.760 --> 01:37:18.760]  and publicly release it immediately
[01:37:18.760 --> 01:37:20.760]  without giving them the opportunity
[01:37:20.760 --> 01:37:22.760]  to read it first
[01:37:22.760 --> 01:37:24.760]  Here's Donald Trump Jr. on Twitter
[01:37:24.760 --> 01:37:26.760]  Schiff sounds like he's panicking
[01:37:26.760 --> 01:37:28.760]  One memo that has been
[01:37:28.760 --> 01:37:30.760]  available to all Congress to read
[01:37:30.760 --> 01:37:32.760]  for a week will be made public
[01:37:32.760 --> 01:37:34.760]  but he wants to release his without showing anyone
[01:37:34.760 --> 01:37:36.760]  Same old nonsense
[01:37:36.760 --> 01:37:38.760]  I think I'll win my bet
[01:37:38.760 --> 01:37:40.760]  that he leaks his
[01:37:40.760 --> 01:37:42.760]  That seems to be his thing
[01:37:42.760 --> 01:37:44.760]  I should also mention that it was disclosed
[01:37:44.760 --> 01:37:46.760]  to the minority today
[01:37:46.760 --> 01:37:48.760]  for the first time
[01:37:48.760 --> 01:37:50.760]  that the majority has evidently opened
[01:37:50.760 --> 01:37:52.760]  an investigation of the FBI
[01:37:52.760 --> 01:37:54.760]  and an investigation of the Department of Justice
[01:37:54.760 --> 01:37:56.760]  Good! Under our committee rules, of course
[01:37:56.760 --> 01:37:58.760]  You ought to be investigated next!
[01:37:58.760 --> 01:38:00.760]  And you will be!
[01:38:00.760 --> 01:38:02.760]  So we already know that the Obama Administration
[01:38:02.760 --> 01:38:04.760]  acted criminally
[01:38:04.760 --> 01:38:06.760]  to write Hillary off before doing an investigation
[01:38:06.760 --> 01:38:08.760]  We already know that it was Obama
[01:38:08.760 --> 01:38:10.760]  that was the corrupt president
[01:38:10.760 --> 01:38:12.760]  that it was Obama that corrupted
[01:38:12.760 --> 01:38:14.760]  the entire halls of
[01:38:14.760 --> 01:38:16.760]  government in the DOJ
[01:38:16.760 --> 01:38:18.760]  and the FBI
[01:38:18.760 --> 01:38:20.760]  And folks, that is what
[01:38:20.760 --> 01:38:22.760]  is in the document
[01:38:22.760 --> 01:38:24.760]  is that Obama and others gave the orders
[01:38:24.760 --> 01:38:26.760]  then they testified to Congress
[01:38:26.760 --> 01:38:28.760]  McCabe, Comey
[01:38:28.760 --> 01:38:30.760]  and lied
[01:38:30.760 --> 01:38:32.760]  about leaking about all of it
[01:38:32.760 --> 01:38:34.760]  and even caught in so many angles
[01:38:34.760 --> 01:38:36.760]  I wanted to get
[01:38:36.760 --> 01:38:38.760]  a former top prosecutor
[01:38:38.760 --> 01:38:40.760]  from Florida on this
[01:38:40.760 --> 01:38:42.760]  and other incarnations
[01:38:42.760 --> 01:38:44.760]  top TV host and radio host
[01:38:44.760 --> 01:38:46.760]  no stranger to you guys
[01:38:46.760 --> 01:38:48.760]  Lionel, the Emmy Award winning television
[01:38:48.760 --> 01:38:50.760]  news decoder and legal analyst
[01:38:50.760 --> 01:38:52.760]  a licensed trial lawyer and former prosecutor
[01:38:52.760 --> 01:38:54.760]  at Lionelmedia
[01:38:54.760 --> 01:38:56.760]  on Twitter, Lionelmedia.com
[01:38:56.760 --> 01:38:58.760]  and he joins us right now
[01:38:58.760 --> 01:39:00.760]  he's got
[01:39:00.760 --> 01:39:02.760]  millions of views just on his YouTube channel
[01:39:02.760 --> 01:39:04.760]  that he just got going recently
[01:39:04.760 --> 01:39:06.760]  so it's great to have him joining
[01:39:06.760 --> 01:39:08.760]  us and see his analysis
[01:39:08.760 --> 01:39:10.760]  just exploding while mainstream media
[01:39:10.760 --> 01:39:12.760]  is imploding
[01:39:12.760 --> 01:39:14.760]  and of course you've been in the mainstream media as well
[01:39:14.760 --> 01:39:16.760]  Lionel as a prosecutor
[01:39:16.760 --> 01:39:18.760]  looking at this, why is Pelosi
[01:39:18.760 --> 01:39:20.760]  so horrified, why is
[01:39:20.760 --> 01:39:22.760]  Schiff so terrified
[01:39:22.760 --> 01:39:24.760]  after making jokes about this for weeks
[01:39:24.760 --> 01:39:26.760]  they are now the pucker factor here
[01:39:26.760 --> 01:39:28.760]  if you put
[01:39:28.760 --> 01:39:30.760]  coal in their rear ends hard to be gross
[01:39:30.760 --> 01:39:32.760]  they'd spit a diamond back out right now
[01:39:32.760 --> 01:39:34.760]  well if you would apply
[01:39:34.760 --> 01:39:36.760]  a plasmagraph to their
[01:39:36.760 --> 01:39:38.760]  it would break, it would redline
[01:39:38.760 --> 01:39:40.760]  you're absolutely correct
[01:39:40.760 --> 01:39:42.760]  what it is is this is exactly
[01:39:42.760 --> 01:39:44.760]  a blueprint
[01:39:44.760 --> 01:39:46.760]  of how the deep state
[01:39:46.760 --> 01:39:48.760]  let's make sure we understand this
[01:39:48.760 --> 01:39:50.760]  you know, those individuals
[01:39:50.760 --> 01:39:52.760]  who tend to obfuscate
[01:39:52.760 --> 01:39:54.760]  tend to believe that the deep state is this term
[01:39:54.760 --> 01:39:56.760]  that you and I came up with all of a sudden
[01:39:56.760 --> 01:39:58.760]  speaks to some fanciful
[01:39:58.760 --> 01:40:00.760]  magical you know
[01:40:00.760 --> 01:40:02.760]  conspiracy theory, it's been around
[01:40:02.760 --> 01:40:04.760]  deep state, police state, surveillance state
[01:40:04.760 --> 01:40:06.760]  whatever you want to call it
[01:40:06.760 --> 01:40:08.760]  but this is the blueprint
[01:40:08.760 --> 01:40:10.760]  it's like reading the plans
[01:40:10.760 --> 01:40:12.760]  for how this thing works
[01:40:12.760 --> 01:40:14.760]  and it is at so many levels
[01:40:14.760 --> 01:40:16.760]  what I respectfully submit
[01:40:16.760 --> 01:40:18.760]  is that the president or anybody should say look
[01:40:18.760 --> 01:40:20.760]  the hell with this memo
[01:40:20.760 --> 01:40:22.760]  let me tell you what happened
[01:40:22.760 --> 01:40:24.760]  and if they want to refute it, fine
[01:40:24.760 --> 01:40:26.760]  that's what I said with the memo
[01:40:26.760 --> 01:40:28.760]  in peace what I said we all know
[01:40:28.760 --> 01:40:30.760]  what's in the memo
[01:40:30.760 --> 01:40:32.760]  let's stop pretending that we need to read it
[01:40:32.760 --> 01:40:34.760]  that we need to find this four page summary
[01:40:34.760 --> 01:40:36.760]  of the rat's nest
[01:40:36.760 --> 01:40:38.760]  and this infected
[01:40:38.760 --> 01:40:40.760]  olid fethid world
[01:40:40.760 --> 01:40:42.760]  that we live in
[01:40:42.760 --> 01:40:44.760]  we don't need this memo but great do it
[01:40:44.760 --> 01:40:46.760]  Adam Schiff looks like
[01:40:46.760 --> 01:40:48.760]  basically he's getting a practice scope
[01:40:48.760 --> 01:40:50.760]  from a guy with a hangnail
[01:40:50.760 --> 01:40:52.760]  he's got this look of we're going to be caught
[01:40:52.760 --> 01:40:54.760]  let's also go back Alex to look at this
[01:40:54.760 --> 01:40:56.760]  think about what it is
[01:40:56.760 --> 01:40:58.760]  when you have the united states government
[01:40:58.760 --> 01:41:00.760]  manufacturing
[01:41:00.760 --> 01:41:02.760]  lies
[01:41:02.760 --> 01:41:04.760]  creating lies
[01:41:04.760 --> 01:41:06.760]  giving it the name dossier
[01:41:06.760 --> 01:41:08.760]  elevating it to some status
[01:41:08.760 --> 01:41:10.760]  of some James Bond novel
[01:41:10.760 --> 01:41:12.760]  paying for
[01:41:12.760 --> 01:41:14.760]  scripted fantasy lies
[01:41:14.760 --> 01:41:16.760]  being paid for by the government
[01:41:16.760 --> 01:41:18.760]  by Hillary Clinton, by the DNC
[01:41:18.760 --> 01:41:20.760]  then using
[01:41:20.760 --> 01:41:22.760]  that scripted basis of lies
[01:41:22.760 --> 01:41:24.760]  to form the basis
[01:41:24.760 --> 01:41:26.760]  for FISA warrants
[01:41:26.760 --> 01:41:28.760]  that is called fruits of the poisonous tree
[01:41:28.760 --> 01:41:30.760]  and everything
[01:41:30.760 --> 01:41:32.760]  that falls there from
[01:41:32.760 --> 01:41:34.760]  every aspect, every derivative
[01:41:34.760 --> 01:41:36.760]  of that initial
[01:41:36.760 --> 01:41:38.760]  lie gets thrown out of court
[01:41:38.760 --> 01:41:40.760]  so general Flynn
[01:41:40.760 --> 01:41:42.760]  if your case was involved
[01:41:42.760 --> 01:41:44.760]  initially in that document
[01:41:44.760 --> 01:41:46.760]  Mr. Papadopoulos
[01:41:46.760 --> 01:41:48.760]  if your case was involved
[01:41:48.760 --> 01:41:50.760]  somehow in that
[01:41:50.760 --> 01:41:52.760]  and your supposed lies
[01:41:52.760 --> 01:41:54.760]  were based initially
[01:41:54.760 --> 01:41:56.760]  on probable cause and the like
[01:41:56.760 --> 01:41:58.760]  created from this imaginary document
[01:41:58.760 --> 01:42:00.760]  then you may have good grounds
[01:42:00.760 --> 01:42:02.760]  to have your plea withdrawn
[01:42:02.760 --> 01:42:04.760]  and this whole thing goes away
[01:42:04.760 --> 01:42:06.760]  remember Manafort and Gates were pre-Trump
[01:42:06.760 --> 01:42:08.760]  that's another story
[01:42:08.760 --> 01:42:10.760]  I'm not a famous prosecutor like yourself
[01:42:10.760 --> 01:42:12.760]  but I've watched Perry Mason and Court TV
[01:42:12.760 --> 01:42:14.760]  both things are casting
[01:42:14.760 --> 01:42:16.760]  fruits of the poisonous tree
[01:42:16.760 --> 01:42:18.760]  and its roots are fraud
[01:42:18.760 --> 01:42:20.760]  lying to the court bringing in frauds
[01:42:20.760 --> 01:42:22.760]  and evidence knowing so
[01:42:22.760 --> 01:42:24.760]  you don't just drop the whole case
[01:42:24.760 --> 01:42:26.760]  you have major civil and criminal charges
[01:42:26.760 --> 01:42:28.760]  generally against the people that cooked up the lie
[01:42:28.760 --> 01:42:30.760]  and we also have
[01:42:30.760 --> 01:42:32.760]  precisely right
[01:42:32.760 --> 01:42:34.760]  and we also go back, let's go back even more
[01:42:34.760 --> 01:42:36.760]  December the 21st
[01:42:36.760 --> 01:42:38.760]  the executive ordered by the president
[01:42:38.760 --> 01:42:40.760]  which said that all of a sudden
[01:42:40.760 --> 01:42:42.760]  we're going to hold assets
[01:42:42.760 --> 01:42:44.760]  and who leaves Eric Schmidt
[01:42:44.760 --> 01:42:51.960]  all about. And think about the civil and criminal liability that he has. This is a Gordian knot.
[01:42:52.760 --> 01:42:55.640]  Exactly. We'll be right back. The whole thing's coming down.
[01:42:57.720 --> 01:43:02.840]  Introducing Fluorolife, the new probiotic line developed exclusively by Infowars Life.
[01:43:02.840 --> 01:43:08.280]  After years of research on the human microbiome, not all probiotics are made the same. Fluorolife
[01:43:08.280 --> 01:43:13.640]  probiotics use a unique targeted delivery system that bypasses the stomach and releases directly
[01:43:13.640 --> 01:43:19.800]  into the intestines for maximum effect. This is critical because stomach acid kills most probiotics
[01:43:19.800 --> 01:43:24.440]  so if you don't have a targeted delivery probiotic then you're cheating your gut health and your
[01:43:24.440 --> 01:43:29.400]  wallet. Fluorolife supports your body's core where you need it most including digestion,
[01:43:29.400 --> 01:43:35.000]  regularity, immunity, the gut lining and metabolism. Did you know that over 80% of your immune system
[01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:40.440]  is located in your gut? That's why increasing gut probiotic levels is so important for overall
[01:43:40.440 --> 01:43:45.880]  health. Fluorolife is sold as a 15 billion probiotic for everyday maintenance care and a 50 billion
[01:43:45.880 --> 01:43:51.000]  probiotic for a 30 day advanced gut restoration program. Head to InfowarsLife.com to pick up
[01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:58.200]  your bottle of Fluorolife probiotics today. That's InfowarsLife.com. Frank in North Carolina,
[01:43:58.200 --> 01:44:03.000]  thanks for holding so long. Go ahead. Yeah, I just have to say something, man. It seems like every
[01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:08.360]  time I turn on your broadcast you're bragging. It just gets old, man. I'm gonna shut you down
[01:44:08.360 --> 01:44:13.640]  right now, okay? We're taking calls about your nomination. Do you understand they're having
[01:44:13.640 --> 01:44:19.720]  congressional hearings trying to shut us down? Do you understand I'm ringing the alarm? If that
[01:44:19.720 --> 01:44:24.600]  was happening to anybody else, I'd be freaked out. I mean, what's it gonna take us being shut down?
[01:44:24.600 --> 01:44:29.640]  Is that what you want, Frank? You know what? I'll put it on pause again. Hey, Frank, do you
[01:44:29.640 --> 01:44:34.600]  understand it's not bragging to say we are the tip of the spear, we're under attack, we need your
[01:44:34.600 --> 01:44:39.800]  help. As much begging as I do, we can barely pay the bills and grow in the face of this. I'm not
[01:44:39.800 --> 01:44:44.200]  gonna just stop growth and let them start pushing us backwards. You understand? I need your help,
[01:44:44.200 --> 01:44:52.520]  Frank. I need your help, Frank. Go to InfowarsStore.com right now and help fund the Infowars.
[01:44:52.520 --> 01:44:56.440]  Do you understand? I need your help, Frank. Free press needs your help, Frank.
[01:44:58.120 --> 01:45:03.480]  Climb to the top of the food chain with Alpha Power by InfowarsLife.
[01:45:03.480 --> 01:45:07.480]  For those who want to increase testosterone and energy levels,
[01:45:08.200 --> 01:45:14.200]  most men know that testosterone levels begin to decline starting around 30 at a rate of about
[01:45:14.200 --> 01:45:21.560]  1 to 2 percent per year. This drop can show signs such as fatigue, low energy, low sex drive,
[01:45:21.560 --> 01:45:27.240]  and muscle loss. Alpha Power is packed with some of the most potent and clinically tested

[01:47:01.400 --> 01:47:05.400]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:47:19.400 --> 01:47:25.000]  So it was what two years ago in the middle of the campaign that Obama started coming out saying
[01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:30.040]  don't question government. Don't talk about tyranny. Don't, you know, don't talk about foreign powers
[01:47:30.840 --> 01:47:36.680]  or your attire. And he was talking about us. He was talking about Trump. He was talking about,
[01:47:36.680 --> 01:47:41.640]  I mean, Hillary had just come out and tapped me by name the day before. And then you look,
[01:47:41.640 --> 01:47:46.600]  they're the ones saying there's these Russians involved in everything when the Russians are
[01:47:46.600 --> 01:47:50.440]  not involved in very much at all, but trying to stabilize their country. The Communist Chinese,
[01:47:50.440 --> 01:47:54.360]  even the Wall Street Journal, admit have like a hundred times or more of the effect. I mean,
[01:47:54.360 --> 01:47:57.800]  they run most of the universities, most of the companies we've been taking over by the
[01:47:57.800 --> 01:48:02.280]  Communist Chinese. The globalist, both parties made a deal with them, the Democrats particularly.
[01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:07.480]  And you just heard Lionel, former prosecutor, syndicated talk show host, Smart Cookie,
[01:48:08.840 --> 01:48:14.440]  pointing out that the fruit of a corruption of lies, something based on a lie from the warrant
[01:48:14.440 --> 01:48:19.560]  on, it all falls. And then there's civil and criminal penalties because this isn't just against
[01:48:19.560 --> 01:48:26.440]  the president. Schiff says that Trump is in a press conference doing this for his own personal
[01:48:26.440 --> 01:48:32.920]  gain and that Congress has, the Republican Party has put themselves ahead of the country.
[01:48:32.920 --> 01:48:37.960]  This was a conspiracy against the president, against our electoral process. And then they
[01:48:37.960 --> 01:48:42.600]  point their finger at everybody, including Nunes, the chairman of the committee, saying he's a Russian
[01:48:42.600 --> 01:48:47.400]  agent. This is the biggest witch hunt. Isn't that Lionel the threat? We'll go to you in a moment.
[01:48:47.400 --> 01:48:52.120]  But first, here's Obama back from that speech saying, don't listen to people that warn about
[01:48:52.120 --> 01:48:59.320]  tyranny. Here it is. Unfortunately, you've grown up hearing voices that incessantly
[01:48:59.320 --> 01:49:04.440]  warn of government as nothing more than some separate sinister entity that's at the root of
[01:49:04.440 --> 01:49:09.720]  all our problems. Some of these same voices also do their best to gum up the works.
[01:49:11.080 --> 01:49:13.880]  They'll warn that tyranny is always lurking just around the corner.
[01:49:13.880 --> 01:49:21.240]  It should reject these voices. So we should reject those voices. And the media always says,
[01:49:21.240 --> 01:49:25.560]  Jones, you claim that you're worried about big government, but now you're embracing it.
[01:49:26.440 --> 01:49:31.960]  I'm for the Constitution. I'm for the Republic. I like the federalist system. It's out of control.
[01:49:31.960 --> 01:49:36.200]  It's been taken around multinationals. I want our country back. Doesn't mean we're going to be
[01:49:36.200 --> 01:49:41.160]  perfect, but at least it'll be our country again. And that's Trump's big sin is he's taking the
[01:49:41.160 --> 01:49:46.920]  country back with the people from the globalist. But here to bring this all into focus, Lionel,
[01:49:46.920 --> 01:49:52.280]  of Lionel Media, again, former prosecutor and media analyst, to bring this into focus,
[01:49:53.080 --> 01:49:57.240]  you got cut off getting into the fact that absolutely the crimes have been committed
[01:49:57.240 --> 01:50:00.920]  via the poison fruit. Flesh that out and other key dynamics to this.
[01:50:01.720 --> 01:50:08.920]  Well, a couple of things here. First, you know, Alex, they have an, they have this amazing ability
[01:50:08.920 --> 01:50:16.520]  to speak the truth, but say it sarcastically. They say, you're gonna hear about people who suggest
[01:50:16.520 --> 01:50:22.120]  that there's a thing called tyranny, yeah. And you're gonna hear people suggest that maybe
[01:50:22.120 --> 01:50:28.440]  the president of Trump maybe controls the Justice Department that because of article two,
[01:50:28.440 --> 01:50:34.680]  because of the Constitution, that they serve at his pleasure, yeah. And they make it sound insane.
[01:50:34.680 --> 01:50:37.640]  You know, a couple of things happened during the course of my history. I've been doing this for
[01:50:37.640 --> 01:50:42.520]  30 years now. And when I started, it was just kind of plain old talk radio and Rush Limbaugh.
[01:50:44.200 --> 01:50:49.640]  Well, Drudge came along first, and then you came along. And I'm not trying to blow spoke
[01:50:49.640 --> 01:50:56.920]  up your keister, my friend. But I mean, it was a whole new game. And then this thing came along,
[01:50:56.920 --> 01:51:03.560]  this ability, this genie out of the bottle, that now gives us QAnon and gives us you. And now
[01:51:03.560 --> 01:51:08.920]  you are our deep throat. Every single day in the old days, when we would sit back prior to the
[01:51:08.920 --> 01:51:13.400]  internet, prior to you prior to Drudge, prior to Jerome Corsi and others, prior to that,
[01:51:13.400 --> 01:51:18.040]  we would just sit back and maybe turn to a neighbor or turn to our local papers and say,
[01:51:18.040 --> 01:51:22.680]  gee, I wish somebody would do something. Well, now we're empowered. What they do is,
[01:51:22.680 --> 01:51:27.080]  they actually explain the truth, but say it sarcastically, give it.
[01:51:27.080 --> 01:51:31.240]  By the way, what you just said is key. I've got people that know Trump for 45 50 years,
[01:51:31.240 --> 01:51:35.800]  not just stone. He would sit around every night around hamburgers or steaks and go,
[01:51:36.680 --> 01:51:40.840]  and go, why doesn't somebody do something? Why doesn't somebody run? Why do they let them
[01:51:40.840 --> 01:51:45.800]  screw us? He would put ads in the paper and snap in, get he was his, his, you know, sisters,
[01:51:45.800 --> 01:51:50.760]  a big federal judge, his family's been really involved as nationalist and populist. This is
[01:51:50.760 --> 01:51:55.720]  not a new Trump. It's just he had his magnet, you know, advertiser, you know, personality,
[01:51:55.720 --> 01:51:59.240]  you know, you're up in New York, you know who he really is. And now they're so scared. It's just
[01:51:59.240 --> 01:52:03.320]  crazy. Keep going. Sorry. No, no, but what happens is, for example, they, you know,
[01:52:04.200 --> 01:52:08.920]  this tactic of them, Jerome Corsi and I, this, this week or a while back did something about
[01:52:08.920 --> 01:52:13.400]  QAnon and talking about the notion of pedophiles. Now, Alex, you have been talking about this since,
[01:52:13.400 --> 01:52:19.960]  since I can remember about how there is an absolute real threat existential or otherwise
[01:52:19.960 --> 01:52:24.520]  of children being trafficked. Okay. You've heard the story. And what they do is there's a group
[01:52:24.520 --> 01:52:29.400]  called right wing watch who basically took our conversation and made it sound far fetched by
[01:52:29.400 --> 01:52:34.520]  actually taking the truth, but putting quotes around it, air quotes and otherwise. It's as
[01:52:34.520 --> 01:52:41.160]  though people say, listen, we can't fight them on the truth. Let's take the incredible, the,
[01:52:41.160 --> 01:52:48.440]  the unbelievable characteristics of this brazen conspiracy against the republic and make it
[01:52:48.440 --> 01:52:54.120]  sound so crazy that it couldn't be true. So what they do is what Obama does, what others do, they
[01:52:54.120 --> 01:53:00.520]  say, they're suggesting that there's this group of people, this, this deep state that actually
[01:53:00.520 --> 01:53:06.760]  conspired against a, a private citizen who dared to be president and that because of,
[01:53:06.760 --> 01:53:13.480]  through these unconstitutional criminal chicanery, they basically contrived and used this FISA warrant
[01:53:13.480 --> 01:53:21.400]  to actually surveil him and his people committing the most atrocious of, of, of violations of law
[01:53:21.400 --> 01:53:27.800]  imaginable. This makes Watergate look like a walk in the park. Now, that's precisely what happened,
[01:53:27.800 --> 01:53:35.560]  but because to the, to the nascent and ignorant person who watches cold bear and reads the USA
[01:53:35.560 --> 01:53:40.360]  today or whatever it is, because for the first time they've been hit, it sounds so unbelievably
[01:53:40.360 --> 01:53:43.880]  hard. That was my next question. Knowing psychology like you do and how they take
[01:53:44.440 --> 01:53:48.280]  truth and they make a joke out of it because they know it's beating them. Now that deep states out,
[01:53:48.280 --> 01:53:52.440]  the memos are out, global governments out, they're not denying any of it. Now they're just trying
[01:53:52.440 --> 01:53:56.280]  to sell it. Well, it is good to have a big secret group of bankers run your life. And
[01:53:57.000 --> 01:54:01.000]  what are they going to do now that everything's crashing down on them? Because I'm really concerned
[01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:07.640]  about so used to power, they're going to strike back somehow. What they have to do is somebody's
[01:54:07.640 --> 01:54:11.560]  got to give Hillary Clinton up. There's a lot of people out there, Alex in the world, very,
[01:54:11.560 --> 01:54:16.680]  very powerful people from Soros and the Rothschilds that you name it and central banksters who say,
[01:54:16.680 --> 01:54:22.520]  why are we, she's putting the heat on us. In New York in 1971, there was a guy named Joe Colombo
[01:54:22.520 --> 01:54:27.480]  of the Colombo crime family who was yacking about how Italians are mistreated and he came up with
[01:54:27.480 --> 01:54:32.440]  this civil rights organization and the other members, the other leaders and bosses of the
[01:54:32.440 --> 01:54:37.560]  family said, we got to take him out because he's putting heat on us. That's what Hillary Clinton
[01:54:37.560 --> 01:54:43.080]  is doing. And to show you the unmitigated hubris of this woman, she shows up on the Grammys and
[01:54:43.080 --> 01:54:49.400]  has the unmitigated audacity to look us in the eye and repeat a portion of that book, that rag,
[01:54:49.400 --> 01:54:55.080]  that book of suspicions. And by the way, you live in New York. Wolf is known as a fraud in New York
[01:54:55.080 --> 01:55:01.880]  by everybody. And here she is laughing, laughing about the president worrying about being poisoned.
[01:55:01.880 --> 01:55:07.320]  And let me also tell you, the struck page memos and those texts. And by the way, Alex,
[01:55:07.320 --> 01:55:11.560]  you ever heard about two people having an affair who did 50,000 texts to each other?
[01:55:11.560 --> 01:55:15.560]  I mean, this is like Anthony Wiener. Anybody have sex anymore? This guy's taking pictures of
[01:55:15.560 --> 01:55:20.440]  himself and sending it. He couldn't pick these women out of a lineup. What is this virtual
[01:55:20.440 --> 01:55:25.160]  adultery? They can't even get that right. And when you hear what they've said and what they've
[01:55:25.160 --> 01:55:30.520]  written, how they've laughed and they've mused about this president being dispatched and being
[01:55:30.520 --> 01:55:37.160]  liquidated and she has the unmitigated hubris to laugh about this. Alex, she's been going on for
[01:55:37.160 --> 01:55:42.920]  so long. But the idea that she's telling you, listen, Jones, listen, Mr. Austin, Texas, you
[01:55:42.920 --> 01:55:48.440]  don't know who I am. I'm a queen. I am the intended candidate. And whether you put me in
[01:55:48.440 --> 01:55:53.720]  office officially, whether you vote me or not, I'm here. You don't, you didn't get the memo.
[01:55:53.720 --> 01:55:58.840]  I'm Hillary Clinton. I don't go away. The great Dan Hicks and his Netflix sang a song one time.
[01:55:58.840 --> 01:56:03.640]  How could I miss you if you won't go away? She's like herpes. She's like herpes or cephalus. She
[01:56:03.640 --> 01:56:09.240]  won't go away. And when she was on the Grammys, when she finally pulled back and she did that
[01:56:09.240 --> 01:56:14.200]  demon smile that looks like it, the clown couldn't make that. A great white shark couldn't make it.
[01:56:14.200 --> 01:56:19.400]  I mean, it's so psychopathic horror movie cover and she does it and no one tells her she looks
[01:56:19.400 --> 01:56:24.840]  like a psychopath. No one wouldn't wolf smiles. He looks the same and no one tells him and then
[01:56:24.840 --> 01:56:29.880]  she won't go away. And you're absolutely right. Hollywood still thinks she's the queen force
[01:56:29.880 --> 01:56:34.440]  feeding her even though the New York Times is coming out about her protecting sex abusers
[01:56:34.440 --> 01:56:39.880]  and people reportedly. She won't go away. It's beautiful though in a way that she's so insane
[01:56:39.880 --> 01:56:46.920]  that she won't go away. This is a woman who stood before us and had neurological seizures.
[01:56:46.920 --> 01:56:52.120]  Repeatedly, who upon seeing a balloon on the night of her investiture,
[01:56:52.680 --> 01:56:58.360]  froze like Angelo Bruno in Philly. She had a man come up with a Benzo pen ready to
[01:56:58.360 --> 01:57:03.080]  zap her in the event she freaks out. She went through contortion. She looked at us and said,
[01:57:03.080 --> 01:57:07.400]  there's nothing wrong with me, but yet they talk about him eating a cheeseburger and whether he
[01:57:07.400 --> 01:57:11.960]  takes Lipitorinite. Do you see how they have been burning it up? Or he didn't feed the fish right.
[01:57:11.960 --> 01:57:17.720]  And that's the thing. The citizen journalist caught her falling down. The media cut it at the
[01:57:17.720 --> 01:57:22.920]  tripping and said, Alex Jones, fake news again. She only stumbled. She did not fall down. She fell
[01:57:22.920 --> 01:57:26.680]  on her face and they threw in there like a slab of meat. And the Secret Service told us a month
[01:57:26.680 --> 01:57:31.880]  before. Follow her everywhere. Follow the black man. She's having seizures every hour. Millie
[01:57:31.880 --> 01:57:37.960]  Weaver and Gavin Winsor reporters caught her a week before in Ohio for an hour in an emergency
[01:57:37.960 --> 01:57:44.680]  tent with emergency stretchers. And the media didn't touch it. Bombshell info. We'll be back

[02:00:16.920 --> 02:00:24.920]  and Lionel former prosecutor and media critic has just got laser focused analysis of what's
[02:00:24.920 --> 02:00:29.960]  happening. Lionel break it down for us why the Democrats are running so scared right now.
[02:00:29.960 --> 02:00:37.560]  The Democrats are petrified because the FISA memo represents a blueprint an actual template
[02:00:37.560 --> 02:00:43.000]  an actual listing the gravamen if you will of an indictment of all of the crimes that have been
[02:00:43.000 --> 02:00:48.760]  committed not by the prior administration but for deep state for years. They are scared because
[02:00:48.760 --> 02:00:55.480]  this list exactly the length of their treachery the depth of their perfidy and how advanced
[02:00:55.480 --> 02:01:01.960]  this treason and sedition actually are that's what they're afraid of. I had the former head of
[02:01:01.960 --> 02:01:05.800]  technical for the NSA say no I've gotten a high level call they want you to put this out today
[02:01:05.800 --> 02:01:10.680]  last week. It is the main FISA report where they say three times I don't know if you've read it
[02:01:11.480 --> 02:01:15.640]  the Democrats came to us wanting to commit crimes we told them come back and rewrite this
[02:01:15.640 --> 02:01:20.680]  and then sections that are blacked out are reportedly mentioned in the official new memo
[02:01:20.680 --> 02:01:25.400]  coming out from congress the media tried to spin that they didn't deny the memo that everybody
[02:01:25.400 --> 02:01:30.840]  ignored they somehow tried to spin it to make it look like I'd put out false evidence you're a
[02:01:30.840 --> 02:01:34.840]  former prosecutor looking at this how would you explain this to a jury because it makes my head
[02:01:34.840 --> 02:01:39.880]  hurt. Well one of the reasons I would say and I would use the the ad is that you always talk about
[02:01:39.880 --> 02:01:44.120]  and that you always know you're over the target when you start taking flak and what this is is
[02:01:44.120 --> 02:01:49.720]  it shows a couple of things look at the levels look at the tendrils of this of this tumor and how
[02:01:49.720 --> 02:01:55.560]  the actual threads of this are first it was a russia gate then it was a russian dossier then it was
[02:01:55.560 --> 02:02:02.840]  trying to to to either explicate or explain hillary clinton's tragic loss then it was trying to remove
[02:02:02.840 --> 02:02:08.440]  him via either impeachment or 24th amendment by creating this fiction called the russian either
[02:02:08.440 --> 02:02:13.720]  the dossier or piss gate pardon my french or whatever you want to call that now that didn't
[02:02:13.720 --> 02:02:20.760]  work that's that's toast that's gone we have habituated to that we don't respond anymore to it
[02:02:20.760 --> 02:02:25.720]  it's it's like a drug the placebo effect nothing happens they've then shifted and they said now
[02:02:25.720 --> 02:02:32.440]  we're going to get down and dirty we're going to create and manufacture the basis of surveillance
[02:02:32.440 --> 02:02:39.080]  and the surveillance will open up doors because we're going to use our gchq buddies to run surveillance
[02:02:39.080 --> 02:02:44.840]  on others remember how that works alex darin fort mead maryland i'm sitting here i'm nsa i've got
[02:02:44.840 --> 02:02:50.040]  gchq he's sitting right next to me there is no headquarters the headquarters is the cloud if i
[02:02:50.040 --> 02:02:54.760]  want to go after alex jones i turn to my british cohort and say listen you're looking for this
[02:02:54.760 --> 02:02:59.800]  russian lawyer right okay good you put a tail on her because you've got her of interest but if you
[02:02:59.800 --> 02:03:07.400]  happen to pick up and expose and unmask somebody she's talking to who i know is alex jones then
[02:03:07.400 --> 02:03:12.440]  that's how i backend it that's how i get into it and by the way that's in the law that they say you
[02:03:12.440 --> 02:03:15.800]  can't spy on your own people in america because we'll get stuff up we just have with the up yeah on
[02:03:15.800 --> 02:03:21.640]  the justice department these are for political powers so we say our allies israel uh the e you
[02:03:21.640 --> 02:03:26.760]  inner poll uh england particularly going back to world war two and now you're we're going to unmask
[02:03:26.760 --> 02:03:31.080]  and watch who we want because you can legally spy on foreigners then we're going to spy on who you
[02:03:31.080 --> 02:03:36.840]  want to spy on and that's how this whole incestuous thing in fact that's why they'll have foreign
[02:03:36.840 --> 02:03:42.440]  uh german or british special ops come and kill us political targets this is real secret and then us
[02:03:42.440 --> 02:03:46.680]  special ops kill other foreign targets for those governments and then the argument is we're still
[02:03:46.680 --> 02:03:52.040]  killing foreign groups but really you're killing your own people and why do you think that russian
[02:03:52.040 --> 02:03:57.160]  lawyer got in there who invited that russian lawyer and that special she was a known soros operative
[02:03:57.160 --> 02:04:02.600]  that they planted to push in there okay imagine this one hey listen honey come on in to the
[02:04:02.600 --> 02:04:09.080]  trump tower yes hey nigel look who i've got there that woman you're looking for you know the russian
[02:04:09.080 --> 02:04:14.280]  lawyer look she's there how do you know because i invited i got the nexus point now now you've
[02:04:14.280 --> 02:04:20.680]  got the point to authorize the surveillance and then once this starts then we start and we look
[02:04:20.680 --> 02:04:25.960]  to the american people who i'm sorry don't know this but they say have you talked to the russian
[02:04:25.960 --> 02:04:32.920]  ambassador he's the ambassador he's talked to everybody what are you talking about how naive
[02:04:32.920 --> 02:04:38.680]  are people and then you create this but understand what i'll say there we've got our guest joining
[02:04:38.680 --> 02:04:43.160]  us leo zigami uh from from from roam but i want to come back to you for a few minutes but book ends
[02:04:43.160 --> 02:04:49.880]  on this because i'm riveted knowing psychology and criminology linel where does it go next on the other
[02:04:49.880 --> 02:04:57.480]  side i'm alex jones news wars dot com please spread that link news wars dot com introducing
[02:04:57.480 --> 02:05:04.040]  cell force by info wars life cell force focuses on mitochondria efficiency and protection
[02:05:04.040 --> 02:05:09.960]  mitochondria produce over 95 percent of your energy they are your body's cellular engines
[02:05:09.960 --> 02:05:14.920]  cell force helps promote your cellular energy production by supporting mitochondria much
[02:05:14.920 --> 02:05:20.680]  like a cellular engine overhaul because when your mitochondria don't run at 100 efficiency
[02:05:20.680 --> 02:05:26.840]  then they start producing reactive oxygen species top scientists agree that aging is most likely
[02:05:26.840 --> 02:05:33.560]  caused by cellular damage resulting from these reactive oxygen species the antioxidants found
[02:05:33.560 --> 02:05:38.920]  in cell force are some of the most powerful available on the market the stronger the antioxidant
[02:05:38.920 --> 02:05:45.560]  the better its ability to scavenge for these reactive oxygen species and other free radicals boost
[02:05:45.560 --> 02:05:52.760]  protect and adapt with cell force from info wars life head to info wars life dot com or call
[02:05:52.760 --> 02:06:08.360]  1-888-253-3139 from the front lines of the information war it's alex jones armor prosecutor
[02:06:08.360 --> 02:06:16.440]  syndicated media critic legal analyst linel is our guest and i wanted him to finish up before
[02:06:16.440 --> 02:06:23.480]  leo zigami joins us with his amazing geopolitical analysis that's been spot on so we're going
[02:06:23.480 --> 02:06:29.080]  to talk to him coming up in the next segment from rome i guess it's about eight o'clock at night
[02:06:29.080 --> 02:06:34.200]  right now but going back to new york city and linel recapping what you said and then getting
[02:06:34.200 --> 02:06:39.400]  into where you think they're going to go now why they're so scared they were so bold thinking
[02:06:39.400 --> 02:06:44.120]  hillary would win so they committed all these crimes try to dig up stuff on trump it didn't work
[02:06:44.120 --> 02:06:50.440]  then once trump won they were even not as hubris filled but now more desperate like cornered rats
[02:06:50.440 --> 02:06:54.840]  as congressman gate said on the broadcast yesterday now they're really in their danger mode
[02:06:54.840 --> 02:07:00.760]  everything they've done over the last 13 months since then has failed i guess 15 months since his uh
[02:07:00.760 --> 02:07:06.520]  since he was president elect where do they go now what do they do now well a couple of things
[02:07:06.520 --> 02:07:13.240]  are first you're looking at the the behavior of a system alex that has been unfettered unregulated
[02:07:13.240 --> 02:07:20.280]  untouched because donald trump should not have won hillary clinton basically said listen don't
[02:07:20.280 --> 02:07:24.520]  worry about pay for play don't worry about the clinton foundation clinton global initiative
[02:07:24.520 --> 02:07:29.640]  clinton health access initiative they're missing money in Haiti water down age drug you don't
[02:07:29.640 --> 02:07:36.600]  understand i'm queen i'm entitled this is my my my apotheosis this is my canonization
[02:07:36.600 --> 02:07:43.720]  i am the queen nothing will go wrong i go back alex to the day december the 21st or 22nd when
[02:07:43.720 --> 02:07:49.800]  eric schmidt all of a sudden hightailed it out of there because you're going to find again like a
[02:07:49.800 --> 02:07:56.680]  cancer has tendrils it has angiogenesis it creates new blood vessels you're going to see a tumor
[02:07:56.680 --> 02:08:02.760]  with markers that's metastatic you're going to see hillary who's at the bottom the foundation the
[02:08:02.760 --> 02:08:08.600]  basis of everything and a lot of people are making deals right now as we speak i would
[02:08:08.600 --> 02:08:14.920]  bet anything who we're saying listen if we give you hillary would you leave us alone it gives
[02:08:14.920 --> 02:08:19.640]  trump a tremendous amount of bargaining power because let's face it he cannot completely upset
[02:08:19.640 --> 02:08:24.120]  the entire republic apple card but if he says okay i'll tell you what i'm gonna do you play ball
[02:08:24.120 --> 02:08:30.840]  with us give us hillary roll over because why did he come up with that executive order why
[02:08:30.840 --> 02:08:36.680]  all of a sudden was there this detailed executive order about human trafficking and how he could
[02:08:36.680 --> 02:08:43.400]  go back and basically seize assets and when when eric schmidt and google when you realize how they
[02:08:43.400 --> 02:08:48.680]  rewrote because let me tell you next thing's gonna happen in laws you know facebook and google
[02:08:48.680 --> 02:08:53.000]  these aren't private corporations these are to be treated like utility companies they're
[02:08:53.000 --> 02:08:57.880]  going to be subsumed under the rubric and under the protections of the first amendment because
[02:08:57.880 --> 02:09:02.360]  you're going to have people who say this is our only source of news so he's high-tailing it you're
[02:09:02.360 --> 02:09:08.840]  going to also say everything that happened everything had as its source as its base as its
[02:09:08.840 --> 02:09:16.920]  genesis hillary rodham felon and this criminal network it's like a alien crashes in a meteorite
[02:09:16.920 --> 02:09:23.480]  it all the slime comes out from there it's then a blueprint back into all the other crime networks
[02:09:23.480 --> 02:09:27.400]  and that's what congressman gate said he said listen it's all about the foundation everybody
[02:09:27.400 --> 02:09:32.120]  that paid her now that they're not getting what they paid for and now that they're about to get
[02:09:32.120 --> 02:09:36.680]  swat teamed they're all going to turn on her and they've already got reportedly fji agents that
[02:09:36.680 --> 02:09:41.560]  have been gone back a year we've now learned and secret service are now spilling their guts
[02:09:41.560 --> 02:09:45.240]  to congress and the president because they now believe the tides term they can tell the truth
[02:09:45.240 --> 02:09:49.160]  and not get killed even though their houses have been broken into you name it and and and
[02:09:49.160 --> 02:09:55.800]  bonjino has said it's child trafficking on eppstein's plane hillary all of them all those guys that
[02:09:55.800 --> 02:10:03.720]  fly on the plane uh winestein uh uh the uh you know the big actor uh kevin spacey i mean
[02:10:03.720 --> 02:10:09.720]  we're about to go down into the nightmare hole and then you look at hillary this demon like
[02:10:09.720 --> 02:10:16.360]  jack o'lantern again going back as a prosecutor as a criminologist her smile doesn't she understand
[02:10:16.360 --> 02:10:21.400]  that that's totally psychotic looking and that her activities are psychotic doesn't she get it
[02:10:21.400 --> 02:10:26.360]  i mean what's wrong with these people why are they so crazy and why are they're like all these
[02:10:26.360 --> 02:10:34.520]  weird effeminate guys worshiping her like she's this giant steaming turd well i could not have said
[02:10:34.520 --> 02:10:41.320]  it better what you're seeing in addition to everything in view of the foregoing is a system
[02:10:41.320 --> 02:10:47.080]  that people have never really understood how this works and i'm telling you right now alex think
[02:10:47.080 --> 02:10:51.880]  about this imagine your bill gates you're the ford foundation soros rocker fellers and all
[02:10:51.880 --> 02:10:57.480]  of a sudden they say guess what did you did you invest in this did you donate to this this criminal
[02:10:57.480 --> 02:11:05.000]  unprosecuted 20 year never audited you're saying they're using it as a roll-up operation for hundreds
[02:11:05.000 --> 02:11:08.600]  of thousands of donors that thought they'd gotten in on the big thing they're now involved in a
[02:11:08.600 --> 02:11:13.080]  paper play scam you're saying it's a giant black mallop if you get people with kids not enough
[02:11:13.080 --> 02:11:16.440]  to have them with women because you know people don't care anymore or even with guys people don't
[02:11:16.440 --> 02:11:20.920]  care anymore it's got to be with kids or money laundering and this is all their influence operation
[02:11:22.040 --> 02:11:26.520]  well also if you caught clawback though you can go to these people to say listen
[02:11:26.520 --> 02:11:31.800]  we'll let you off the hook what can you tell us about hillary clinton because up till now when
[02:11:31.800 --> 02:11:36.360]  you get the no idea what you're saying i'm saying the clinton's were clearly using this as blackmail
[02:11:36.360 --> 02:11:40.120]  once they got people involved i'm saying now it's the reverse use us to have them testify
[02:11:40.120 --> 02:11:47.320]  precisely because remember go back to bernie made off clawback is the word you never want to hear
[02:11:47.320 --> 02:11:51.480]  this is all of the monies that you put in all of the profits that you made thousands of top
[02:11:51.480 --> 02:11:56.600]  donors are now looking at clawback of the money they invested in the fraudulent foundation
[02:11:57.720 --> 02:12:01.320]  theoretically that's what i would do if i was involved with this and i would say listen we
[02:12:01.320 --> 02:12:05.000]  don't want you it's just like when you go off to sammy the ball or you go after anybody else or
[02:12:05.000 --> 02:12:11.400]  joe velachi we don't want you we want the top dog and the best part is is that when you look at the
[02:12:11.400 --> 02:12:17.880]  feisigate and you look at this particular memo what it does is everything makes sense you knew
[02:12:17.880 --> 02:12:22.040]  it was corrupt you know it's ever here when somebody dies and they open their body up and they say
[02:12:22.040 --> 02:12:26.520]  my god we never knew that cancer was this bad we opened them up and then we had to close them
[02:12:26.520 --> 02:12:33.800]  up the cancer was everywhere the american people have no idea of the level of rancid corruption
[02:12:33.800 --> 02:12:42.920]  and how our beloved republic has been taken over by just this one person it all goes to her and think
[02:12:42.920 --> 02:12:48.840]  about this and if somebody can figure out a way to explain listen do you really want to go down do
[02:12:48.840 --> 02:12:53.000]  you want to basically have everything crumble because if you're a legion's allegiance to this
[02:12:54.680 --> 02:12:59.960]  that she had two administrations with with with clinton her husband and then then bush worked
[02:12:59.960 --> 02:13:04.040]  with her and then obama clinton was just having sex with women all day and then you know sorting
[02:13:04.040 --> 02:13:10.680]  cocaine she was running around like a power mad goblin just getting all the names all the controls
[02:13:10.680 --> 02:13:15.080]  and the elites went okay you kind of run things as long as we get what we want and now she won't
[02:13:15.080 --> 02:13:20.440]  go away because she was the queen of the united states linel this is our best interview ever
[02:13:20.440 --> 02:13:23.640]  you are on fire my friend i'm really impressed really impressed with what you do with david
[02:13:23.640 --> 02:13:27.080]  night every week when you join him please come join us every week here thank you so much my friend
[02:13:27.080 --> 02:13:32.280]  thank you sir it was a pleasure thank you we're gonna come back with leo zegami from rome who
[02:13:32.280 --> 02:13:35.960]  is amazing as well with all his predictions that have come through and uh the latest on
[02:13:35.960 --> 02:13:39.640]  what's happening in europe i can't wait to talk to him for the balance of transmission just briefly
[02:13:39.640 --> 02:13:43.960]  here i didn't even plug last hour because i get so busy and so focused and we won't exist if i don't
[02:13:43.960 --> 02:13:50.520]  start start plugging we have a lot of amazing products right now our new special that we're
[02:13:50.520 --> 02:13:58.280]  running is the info wars life and body and mind combo 40 off and it's brain force plus
[02:13:59.160 --> 02:14:05.400]  the great new tropic and vitamin mineral fusion that's amazing all 40 off when you get the two
[02:14:05.400 --> 02:14:09.240]  together and i'm not going to belabor this point i'm going to explain it i'm a very loyal person
[02:14:09.240 --> 02:14:13.320]  so is dr group he's a great guy he makes about a third of our supplements we had the idea to come
[02:14:13.320 --> 02:14:21.320]  out with the just an incredible nerve regrowth a telomere preservation system with the very best
[02:14:21.320 --> 02:14:26.600]  most expensive high quality ingredients but not add the big markup in to give you what top clinics
[02:14:26.600 --> 02:14:32.840]  are selling for 300 400 500 dollars for 150 bucks retail for like $99 discounted so we make like 30
[02:14:32.840 --> 02:14:38.440]  bucks on it but then i wanted to lower the prices i want some of the top firms in the country groups
[02:14:38.440 --> 02:14:43.960]  did a great job and i came out with cell force which is basically dna force plus and he looked at
[02:14:43.960 --> 02:14:49.960]  the the the the the documents all of us even asking and said listen i am not even big enough with my
[02:14:49.960 --> 02:14:54.920]  production facilities that are still huge to one of the top developers in the country also producer
[02:14:55.960 --> 02:15:01.320]  you guys just take over dna force because i can't get this at the price you can that this other
[02:15:01.320 --> 02:15:09.320]  big firm can and it's high quality bio pqq uh go q can so much more so we're not going to have to
[02:15:09.320 --> 02:15:13.960]  then come out with this uh cell force this is one run we did which is really
[02:15:16.040 --> 02:15:21.000]  i think this is doesn't confuse me but it's a long convoluted story is really dna force plus
[02:15:21.640 --> 02:15:29.400]  so it's more in each caplet of the highest quality then it is a lower price we were going to do it

[02:21:16.680 --> 02:21:21.160]  we've got paul joseph watson from london hosting and then the war room kicks off for three hours

[02:22:37.080 --> 02:22:43.080]  give our fair use analysis of it but leo zagami before i ever heard anybody talk about now there
[02:22:43.080 --> 02:22:48.760]  was going to be a jesuit pope that would end up taking over and then you named uh frances five years
[02:22:48.760 --> 02:22:53.640]  before i'd ever heard of him and i talked to my cis horses and they said oh he's uber bad hooked him
[02:22:53.640 --> 02:22:57.960]  with soros and others going to bring in the islamist all of it uh you were the first to
[02:22:57.960 --> 02:23:01.560]  break down how they were going to use blackmail to bring down the last pope and have two pups at
[02:23:01.560 --> 02:23:05.480]  once and then have pups only being for a few years and leave uh you know getting rid of the
[02:23:05.480 --> 02:23:11.160]  tradition and all of it that's why he wrote the book uh pope frances the last pope uh and it's
[02:23:11.160 --> 02:23:17.240]  just all coming true so i really respect you a lot uh leo zagami dot com i wonder why but i wasn't
[02:23:17.240 --> 02:23:22.040]  even following you the trolls would attack you and say you were horrible and terrible so i found
[02:23:22.040 --> 02:23:25.960]  you 10 years ago because you were being attacked then i kind of thought well maybe the trolls are
[02:23:25.960 --> 02:23:30.840]  right but at least i found you and then wasn't sure and then i saw what you said come true so
[02:23:30.840 --> 02:23:33.960]  then i thought okay he's credible then i met you in rome and you've been on many times you're a good
[02:23:33.960 --> 02:23:39.560]  friend so congratulations on being right staying stalwart and focused and uh coming through the
[02:23:39.560 --> 02:23:43.720]  fire here my friend but that's what they say about good wine it just gets better over time
[02:23:43.720 --> 02:23:47.880]  and people know about me despite all my issues i'm not perfect that they know we mean well
[02:23:47.880 --> 02:23:51.960]  we tell the truth we've broken thousands of stories we're here for justice in the future
[02:23:51.960 --> 02:23:56.600]  so leo good to have you here what do you want to tackle first the state of the union uh the
[02:23:56.600 --> 02:24:02.520]  nationalism taking over europe you predicted burlesconi coming back now into favor uh putin
[02:24:02.520 --> 02:24:07.080]  just so much to cover but i want to do big broad strokes generality first because you tend to
[02:24:07.080 --> 02:24:10.840]  drill into little facts of each story as a journalist and the best selling author i want to
[02:24:10.840 --> 02:24:13.560]  in this five minutes we have to break the next three segments you'll have the floor to get into
[02:24:13.560 --> 02:24:18.760]  details i want big broad strokes the general state of the globe and state of the union the state of
[02:24:18.760 --> 02:24:20.920]  uh you know uh italy from leo zagami
[02:24:24.520 --> 02:24:31.720]  well i think first of all alex that the state of the union started in davos with the trams
[02:24:31.720 --> 02:24:39.480]  intervention in the mix of this globalist front which is a gradually getting weaker and weaker
[02:24:39.480 --> 02:24:47.880]  and we have seen this coalition of free european leaders macron angela mercer and gentiloni
[02:24:47.880 --> 02:24:56.920]  against donald j trump losing because in the end trump was definitely a winner in davos he
[02:24:57.560 --> 02:25:04.360]  did and said the right things and i think that today can only uh state the obvious that the
[02:25:04.360 --> 02:25:10.920]  state of the union is in a great state so i am very happy to see that he's really doing the things
[02:25:10.920 --> 02:25:17.560]  he said he would do so continue here with the whole state of the world right now i mean is it
[02:25:17.560 --> 02:25:23.320]  accurate to say that globalism the satanic pedophile rings in the vatican all of these evil
[02:25:23.320 --> 02:25:29.320]  operations it seems are are are are are are being turned right now the tides turning but they're
[02:25:29.320 --> 02:25:35.560]  intensifying their fight back so the battle's about to be joined and it's like yes
[02:25:39.400 --> 02:25:46.120]  again we had no sky problems until now but it's a miracle technology so will that's why i i even
[02:25:46.120 --> 02:25:49.640]  hate to jump in myself because then it'll mess up the sky my audio back to him if he has
[02:25:49.640 --> 02:25:51.960]  if he has a bad connection uh leo please continue
[02:25:51.960 --> 02:26:00.120]  yes as i was saying uh trump is really giving his great support towards this war against
[02:26:00.120 --> 02:26:06.200]  pedophilia against human trafficking we saw as you remember a few months ago those terrible
[02:26:06.200 --> 02:26:13.160]  images arriving from libya fortunately things are changing they're they're trying to to really
[02:26:13.160 --> 02:26:18.760]  calm down this human trafficking which is of course then the the back door to pedophilia
[02:26:18.760 --> 02:26:25.720]  and human slavery recently an italian newspaper the main italian financial newspaper has actually
[02:26:25.720 --> 02:26:32.920]  started to talk about the reinstallment of slavery so we are really in front of a human
[02:26:32.920 --> 02:26:39.560]  condition we thought that in this new century we will never encounter again slavery but slavery
[02:26:39.560 --> 02:26:46.840]  is becoming gradually an option that the liberals are really looking into as a feasible option
[02:26:46.840 --> 02:26:53.880]  so it's incredible but it's happening here in italy where we have thousands of people flooding
[02:26:53.880 --> 02:27:01.160]  arriving from uh from the coast of course of africa every day and george soros supporting
[02:27:01.160 --> 02:27:07.480]  his own political parties his own politicians for these erections that are upcoming we've
[02:27:07.480 --> 02:27:13.480]  been talking uh together in rome about silvio berlusconi is a central figure that will of course
[02:27:13.480 --> 02:27:21.000]  rise again the problem is being that last week even silvio berlusconi was forced to go and talk
[02:27:21.000 --> 02:27:30.600]  with philip yunker and meet together with tayani who is the vice president of the european community
[02:27:30.600 --> 02:27:39.400]  european union sorry and basically this meeting now is a kind of making creating problems within
[02:27:39.400 --> 02:27:47.480]  berlusconi's coalition because the northern league apparently uh was attacked by philip yunker who asked
[02:27:47.480 --> 02:27:54.680]  berlusconi to cite them in case he will get elected again so there is now in the last
[02:27:55.240 --> 02:28:04.040]  24 to 48 hours a lot of turmoil within actually berlusconi's coalition because philip yunker who
[02:28:04.040 --> 02:28:11.160]  is a not a non-elected figure that's another important element of trams intervention in davos
[02:28:11.160 --> 02:28:17.400]  what he said he said he was against the not not elected figures and in europe is full of not elected
[02:28:17.400 --> 02:28:23.080]  figures while tramp promised in davos that in america the time for not elected figures is
[02:28:23.080 --> 02:28:29.240]  ended is finished is closed then yunker is literally the grandson of the top nazi next to
[02:28:29.240 --> 02:28:32.920]  hitler and still owns luxembourg needs to be arrested we're gonna come back and talk about
[02:28:32.920 --> 02:28:39.080]  the unelected ee you italy voting to not let an ee you army uh form uh berlusconi buddies with
[02:28:39.080 --> 02:28:44.120]  putin the big nationalist roaring back uh just everywhere it's an i remember you telling me
[02:28:44.120 --> 02:28:48.600]  two years ago that they don't kill berlusconi he'll be back within three years that was all
[02:28:48.600 --> 02:28:53.160]  that was about two and a half years ago we sat there in rome together it's just incredible how
[02:28:53.160 --> 02:29:00.600]  smart leo zigami is hear that that's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves
[02:29:00.600 --> 02:29:07.880]  ransacked the place and what they don't steal will be destroyed this year resolve not to be the next

[02:33:29.240 --> 02:33:37.560]  broadcasting worldwide from the info wars dot com studios all right silvio burlesconi
[02:33:37.560 --> 02:33:46.680]  i mean going back decades was just a lounge singer and artist and he then began to buy
[02:33:46.680 --> 02:33:54.360]  newspapers and media and has just been pro idly and under globalism he bucked it and he helped
[02:33:54.360 --> 02:33:59.080]  bring jobs back to idly and and you know the great artisanship and all the rest of people want to buy
[02:33:59.080 --> 02:34:03.880]  sunglasses from italians they want to buy wine from italians they want to buy shoes from italians
[02:34:03.880 --> 02:34:09.160]  they don't want an italian name on it and have it made in a sweatshop in china so they set him up
[02:34:09.160 --> 02:34:13.720]  they were moving from power but from my own research and went and went to gami who's good
[02:34:13.720 --> 02:34:16.760]  friends with him has talked about and of course the gami's been involved in the government as well
[02:34:16.760 --> 02:34:22.120]  and other things we won't get into and brought me to some of the interesting levels of idly and some
[02:34:22.120 --> 02:34:26.360]  of the places you know off record to meet with some folks i'll just leave it at that they explained
[02:34:26.360 --> 02:34:30.760]  to me we're gonna have a big nationalist movement idly's coming back europe's coming back we're working
[02:34:30.760 --> 02:34:36.360]  with other nations uh burlesconi's been talking to putin explaining that we need to have nationalism
[02:34:36.360 --> 02:34:40.680]  and this is not like you told putin what to do it's just that those two were allied early on
[02:34:40.680 --> 02:34:44.440]  and again it's not about russian interest it's russia understands they were overtaken by outside
[02:34:44.440 --> 02:34:49.960]  interest they understand these interests are not pro human and and and are really evil and are
[02:34:49.960 --> 02:34:56.200]  anti christian so you can call putin or even a burlesconi from my own research the guy will tell
[02:34:56.200 --> 02:35:00.840]  me if i'm wrong traditionalist and they just don't they're not out to get russia they're not
[02:35:00.840 --> 02:35:06.440]  to get idly and along comes trump saying i admire putin he's strong he's built this country back up
[02:35:06.440 --> 02:35:10.760]  he's kicked out the foreign controllers and he's he's bringing back some prosperity i want to be
[02:35:10.760 --> 02:35:15.480]  like that and bigger he saw putin even mainstream media had said going back two years ago is the
[02:35:15.480 --> 02:35:20.440]  world leader the most respected the most powerful even though his country's been run down because
[02:35:20.440 --> 02:35:25.880]  he actually stands for something and trump said imagine if america does that imagine and then now
[02:35:25.880 --> 02:35:30.440]  it's like trump shows up everyone's just like doesn't even know what to do and they're so scared of
[02:35:30.440 --> 02:35:35.400]  him getting with putin because you look at world war two and the natural alliances and we're fighting
[02:35:35.400 --> 02:35:40.200]  yonker the air to the nazis it's the same crap over and over again but this time the globalists
[02:35:40.200 --> 02:35:45.560]  aren't going to have idly on their side for their world domination move and that's my summation
[02:35:45.560 --> 02:35:49.320]  talking to leo zigami getting into all the geopolitical stuff and we had dinner a couple times
[02:35:49.320 --> 02:35:53.480]  two hour dinners you only talk about was burlesconi explaining how they persecuted him
[02:35:53.480 --> 02:35:57.480]  how they claim he abused women it's the same thing they've done here with trump
[02:35:57.480 --> 02:36:01.400]  how do you see this going did i say anything wrong is that accurate what i said and then
[02:36:01.400 --> 02:36:07.480]  where do you see this nationalist movement that's exploding going well definitely uh
[02:36:07.480 --> 02:36:13.320]  there is a big sovereignty movement a movement for the sovereignty of the state uh you can call it
[02:36:13.320 --> 02:36:17.560]  nationalist but i will call it for the return to the sovereignty because italy has lost the
[02:36:17.560 --> 02:36:22.360]  sovereignty to a european union full of bureaucrats who are not but it's only italy with its own
[02:36:22.360 --> 02:36:28.120]  boats blocking sorrows bringing in thousands of africans a day i mean it's italy finally woke up
[02:36:28.120 --> 02:36:35.720]  was that wrong absolutely but now we face a big problem because if angela merkel and macron
[02:36:36.360 --> 02:36:44.200]  have indeed in some way found some kind of compromise then things will be very bad for
[02:36:44.200 --> 02:36:51.080]  italy now we face a big problem with donald trump in the us being so protectionist italy
[02:36:51.080 --> 02:36:58.040]  will lose 40 billion dollars out of the made in italy but it is italy's fault so berlusconi
[02:36:58.040 --> 02:37:04.920]  indeed could be a change a positive change the problem is that is of course blackmailable
[02:37:04.920 --> 02:37:10.200]  he still has a lot of skeletons in the closet that they want to use against him you remember
[02:37:10.200 --> 02:37:17.480]  how they easily kicked him out a few years back so we need to to see if berlusconi is stable enough
[02:37:17.480 --> 02:37:23.560]  the fact that now yunker has received them in the european union a few days ago of course change
[02:37:23.560 --> 02:37:29.800]  things because it demonstrates that there is some kind of deal going on and this deal goes
[02:37:30.520 --> 02:37:37.160]  of course through it's also the the fact that in europe at the moment we have poland we have
[02:37:37.160 --> 02:37:42.520]  angary who are really breaking off from the george soros european led union
[02:37:42.520 --> 02:37:48.200]  and sure he's at the heart of it he brags about it so let me ask you this how are italians from
[02:37:48.200 --> 02:37:54.280]  two years ago were endkeepers had all their guests thrown out and african migrants are you know
[02:37:54.280 --> 02:37:59.080]  put into it since then i mean did that wake italy up or where is italy politically i know last
[02:37:59.080 --> 02:38:05.640]  year that you voted twice to say no to e u expansion and e u army well as you know i was a candidate
[02:38:05.640 --> 02:38:11.400]  with berlusconi in the last elections i'm not a candidate in these elections because i think
[02:38:11.400 --> 02:38:18.440]  that unfortunately these elections will be in a way manipulated so in the end we will be forced
[02:38:18.440 --> 02:38:24.520]  with another uh you ran for the senate and you were in the lead and then explain tell folks
[02:38:24.520 --> 02:38:28.120]  the story you said there were pedophiles in the government and the vatican it all came out months
[02:38:28.120 --> 02:38:33.560]  later you were even arrested and put in a mental institution for two days well of course if you
[02:38:33.560 --> 02:38:39.080]  go against these people you pay for the consequences at that time so that's how they begin that's how
[02:38:39.080 --> 02:38:42.280]  they knocked you out of the lead and explain that because that was in the newspapers but i mean
[02:38:42.280 --> 02:38:47.960]  they literally put you in a mental ward so you go down in the polls well absolutely i mean once
[02:38:47.960 --> 02:38:54.280]  you you are put in a in a mental ward that you are not credible anymore so that's it they they
[02:38:54.280 --> 02:39:00.760]  burnt me politically they wanted to make sure that my revolution what i was trying to do with
[02:39:00.760 --> 02:39:06.600]  the pitchfork revolution will not have any more consequences for italy and the constants were
[02:39:06.600 --> 02:39:10.840]  already heavy because we managed to block the whole of italy for a couple of months with strikes
[02:39:10.840 --> 02:39:17.880]  and so on now we have these elections on the fourth and i tell you for the first time alex i don't
[02:39:17.880 --> 02:39:24.280]  really want to vote because i don't see myself represented in any way i think that bergus coney
[02:39:24.280 --> 02:39:30.440]  unfortunately will be forced to compromise though he is the only one at the moment with the northern
[02:39:30.440 --> 02:39:40.200]  league uh two uh fight soros i have information by a journalist called parisi that george soros
[02:39:40.200 --> 02:39:47.240]  has infiltrated bergus coney's party and basically he is there is some politicians in the centering
[02:39:47.240 --> 02:39:53.960]  uh right coalition with bergus coney that are already on the payroll of george soros well i have
[02:39:53.960 --> 02:39:57.880]  to tell you it's it's very hard to fight soros because he's got hundreds of billions more than
[02:39:57.880 --> 02:40:03.480]  they say he's got you know i was just making a main globalist uh a literal james bond villain
[02:40:03.480 --> 02:40:08.040]  we personally have confirmed it's going to be coming out very very soon the documents everything
[02:40:09.080 --> 02:40:12.520]  that just like they promise to infiltrate every conservative organization through media matters
[02:40:12.520 --> 02:40:18.440]  that he funds that we we we had george soros penetration we stopped it we recognized it we
[02:40:18.440 --> 02:40:22.440]  didn't know what it was and stopped it but we were able to get the witnesses in the documents
[02:40:22.440 --> 02:40:29.640]  so we even got penetrated none of our none of our core areas but i mean this guy means business well
[02:40:29.640 --> 02:40:36.600]  open society now is opposing openly the newcomers of these elections in italy which are regarded as
[02:40:36.600 --> 02:40:43.000]  the most dangerous it's not bergus coney but it is casapound i know casapound very well they are
[02:40:44.040 --> 02:40:49.800]  a party which is very right wing far right if you want to describe it in that way they seem to be
[02:40:49.800 --> 02:40:57.640]  very successful with people and so now soros is openly fighting them by doing articles on his
[02:40:58.360 --> 02:41:06.680]  newspapers paying journalists to discredit them on magazines like mary claire and things like this
[02:41:06.680 --> 02:41:13.640]  so there is an open war at the moment with his open society against this group called casapound
[02:41:13.640 --> 02:41:20.200]  which is a bit like the golden dawn in greece and that's not associated with the golden dawn of elissa
[02:41:20.200 --> 02:41:28.680]  crawley is it no no of course no no but you remember in greece there was a right wing party
[02:41:30.360 --> 02:41:35.560]  which uh rise in the last election in the last two elections in greece and was quite successful
[02:41:35.560 --> 02:41:42.600]  then they were actually uh some of them were were killed other than were persecuted i don't remember
[02:41:42.600 --> 02:41:46.200]  in the end i remember so so we're going to break when we come back and i'll let you into whatever
[02:41:46.200 --> 02:41:51.080]  you want to cover he's got a lot of topics historically in 60 seconds what point are we at right now
[02:41:54.360 --> 02:41:56.120]  what point are we historically right now
[02:41:58.600 --> 02:42:06.040]  well we are moving towards a situation of contrast between the us and the e you if
[02:42:06.040 --> 02:42:13.240]  uh of course the trump is doing his own interest and he's doing a great job but here in in the e you
[02:42:13.240 --> 02:42:20.360]  we are in enemy territory we are in the hands of the mondial and it seems very difficult that
[02:42:20.360 --> 02:42:26.280]  we get away from it it's it's been easy for you in america because you still have the sovereignty
[02:42:26.280 --> 02:42:32.520]  and the strong will of donald j trump to fight this war in europe we don't have leaders that are strong
[02:42:32.520 --> 02:42:39.880]  but the fact that he's 10 years older than donald j trump doesn't make it easy when you have to
[02:42:39.880 --> 02:42:45.560]  fight a war like this you need a lot of energy let's talk about the will of donald trump from
[02:42:45.560 --> 02:42:51.560]  italy get a really smart journalist take leo zegami on the other side of this break and of course

[02:47:38.280 --> 02:47:42.920]  and analysis with some of the crew and then right through midnight tonight we'll have hours of phone
[02:47:42.920 --> 02:47:51.320]  calls excerpts of the speech show much more i intellectually follow my own research but i've
[02:47:51.320 --> 02:47:58.120]  learned to go with my gut and my gut tells me they're going to strike back we've got to ask
[02:47:58.120 --> 02:48:05.560]  ourselves how are they going to do it we'll talk about trump's will but trump on air but in person
[02:48:05.560 --> 02:48:14.680]  many times has told me and of course over the phone call that in person that i am committed to
[02:48:14.680 --> 02:48:18.920]  america and i'm committed to sovereignty and i'm committed to christians to have their rights
[02:48:18.920 --> 02:48:24.200]  and for due process and to not have america be singled out and set up for destruction and alex
[02:48:24.200 --> 02:48:29.080]  i need you to continue doing what you're doing and pressing the attack i need you to take action
[02:48:29.080 --> 02:48:34.200]  you know i'm pro in the media there because he's told me that probably five times six times but they
[02:48:34.200 --> 02:48:38.360]  never pick it up because they don't want to quote trump saying press the attack that means you're
[02:48:38.360 --> 02:48:42.920]  already in the attack but even though you may get a lot of losses that's what press the attack means
[02:48:42.920 --> 02:48:47.240]  give it all you got like it's the like it's the final battle of your life that's what press the
[02:48:47.240 --> 02:48:54.680]  attack means and i'm pressing the attack because trump's pressing the attack and and he's leading
[02:48:54.680 --> 02:48:59.080]  from the front we haven't seen that hundreds of years a general a president you name it that
[02:48:59.080 --> 02:49:04.280]  licensed towards washington that leads from the front of the troops and you're you're you're seeing
[02:49:04.280 --> 02:49:07.800]  it with president trump right now and you're seeing the economy and everything come back
[02:49:07.800 --> 02:49:12.680]  because we were artificially being robbed we're gonna go back to leo zegami everybody should get
[02:49:12.680 --> 02:49:17.080]  his book particularly from his own website so that you're not giving money to amazon but if you
[02:49:17.080 --> 02:49:20.600]  got to get it there get it one way or the other you need to read it especially if you're a catholic
[02:49:20.600 --> 02:49:24.200]  but so many great catholic friends such i judge a tree by its fruits the average catholic i know
[02:49:24.200 --> 02:49:28.440]  is such a great person probably like you know so many people like mel Gibson you name it his dad
[02:49:28.440 --> 02:49:34.840]  hutton all of them have been on the show before obviously hutton uh but how did this evil totally
[02:49:34.840 --> 02:49:38.760]  take it over how did it do that we'll talk to leo zegami in a minute now before i go there
[02:49:41.080 --> 02:49:46.120]  this all happened the last two weeks and then i was sitting there talking to our marketing folks
[02:49:46.120 --> 02:49:50.600]  and it's really i'm the marketing guy but they put up on the shopping cart in forestore.com how to
[02:49:50.600 --> 02:49:55.320]  explain this and they just said why don't you just sell it out and not explain it and they just come
[02:49:55.320 --> 02:49:59.880]  out with dna force plus and i said you know but i don't want to tell them this is really awesome
[02:49:59.880 --> 02:50:05.240]  and then discontinue it when it's going to be dna force plus so i'm going to try to explain this
[02:50:06.440 --> 02:50:13.720]  as best i can they have known compounds like bio pqq and coq 10 and the other incredible
[02:50:13.720 --> 02:50:18.600]  ingredients that are in this at very high levels and very strong organically produced levels where
[02:50:18.600 --> 02:50:23.560]  you actually get absorption not the synthetic crap the clinic sells us for 300 to 400 dollars
[02:50:23.560 --> 02:50:29.000]  and it has less of what's in dna force than we sell i saw that and said let me just mark it up 80
[02:50:29.000 --> 02:50:36.040]  percent undercut the whole market and take over and funder operation i did that but then listeners
[02:50:36.040 --> 02:50:42.040]  are like listen it's 150 retail you sell for 9995 it's awesome it's 50 60 bucks a bottle it's not
[02:50:42.040 --> 02:50:46.360]  even funding us so i kept looking with top firms in the country and i scaled up or have i ordered
[02:50:46.360 --> 02:50:53.400]  enough of it i would get it where i could get it for like you know 30 bucks and then sell it for
[02:50:53.400 --> 02:50:57.720]  80 bucks and be able to fund the operation most places will give you some synthetic stuff that
[02:50:57.720 --> 02:51:02.120]  cost them five dollars and sell it for 50 the average just coq 10 is like 50 bucks or bio pqq
[02:51:02.120 --> 02:51:06.040]  is like 16 bucks for just a little bit of bottle of crap that's not even real basically it's it's
[02:51:06.040 --> 02:51:12.120]  synthetic we have the real stuff here ladies and gentlemen and so let me explain this works we got
[02:51:14.440 --> 02:51:16.920]  i've already lost my bottle and i go back to my guess i apologize
[02:51:16.920 --> 02:51:24.280]  i've already lost my bottle here of uh cell force we can put it on screen we got 10 000 bottles of
[02:51:24.280 --> 02:51:31.160]  cell force that's weird it was just in here we had 10 000 bottles of cell force and then listeners

[02:53:46.120 --> 02:53:50.600]  minutes four minutes here five minutes next segment so honored to have you cover any subjects you
[02:53:50.600 --> 02:53:55.640]  want now big topics what's happening at the vatican that what's happening worldwide people need to know
[02:53:55.640 --> 02:54:04.520]  well first of all cardinal pelle we left him a few months ago that he's waiting for the trial and
[02:54:04.520 --> 02:54:10.280]  now some new things have happened this guy called damian dignan died at the beginning of January
[02:54:10.280 --> 02:54:17.080]  he was one of the main people who was testifying against cardinal pelle saying of course stating
[02:54:17.080 --> 02:54:23.320]  that he was raped he died and this means that maybe now cardinal pelle could be even acquitted
[02:54:23.320 --> 02:54:29.720]  of this whole thing which is incredible they were really working the vatican also with the writer
[02:54:29.720 --> 02:54:38.040]  who has made a book on cardinal pelle in order to testify and that this cardinal is not really the
[02:54:38.040 --> 02:54:45.480]  monster that is being depicted worldwide so cardinal pelle is still behind the scenes trying to
[02:54:45.480 --> 02:54:51.160]  rebuild this image and probably in some way getting out of this trial that is being said he
[02:54:51.160 --> 02:54:56.120]  reportedly spent the rest of trafficking over 100 children and this whole network to basically the
[02:54:56.120 --> 02:55:00.280]  deputy pope how does he get out of this because i noticed it was in the news but never covered again
[02:55:01.720 --> 02:55:08.280]  and it seems incredible alex but the most incredible thing is that they have used as a
[02:55:08.280 --> 02:55:16.360]  subpoena this book that was made by an investigative journalist called louis milligan that basically
[02:55:16.360 --> 02:55:23.320]  testifies brings in people who gives their opinion about the whole thing and i don't know they are
[02:55:23.320 --> 02:55:29.400]  trying to turn it in a way that cardinal pelle would be a good guy in a few months they can't let
[02:55:29.400 --> 02:55:36.440]  cardinal pelle be arrested because cardinal pelle is the treasurer of the vatican and he is really
[02:55:36.440 --> 02:55:41.640]  the holder to the to the main so let's be clear they use pedophilia to take over the globalist
[02:55:41.640 --> 02:55:45.880]  now they're going to protect the people that helped infiltrate and reportedly do it so now
[02:55:45.880 --> 02:55:51.640]  that's that's why the leftist media is saying it's no big deal that this new pope is covering it up
[02:55:54.200 --> 02:55:59.000]  well this new pope in this when he went in south america he was attacked because he's
[02:55:59.000 --> 02:56:05.480]  protecting a pedophile who escaped from south america to europe and is now residing in a convent
[02:56:05.480 --> 02:56:13.640]  in italy and when he arrived in peru he had to defend the bishop there who himself had
[02:56:13.640 --> 02:56:19.480]  covered up for this pedophilia priest who is also a very important priest because he's the
[02:56:19.480 --> 02:56:25.400]  founder of an organization called sodalizium cristiane vitae and because he's so powerful
[02:56:25.400 --> 02:56:30.040]  he's a little bit like father marcello in the legionaries of christ they want to protect him so
[02:56:30.040 --> 02:56:36.360]  they put him in this convent in italy and they are neglecting this tradition to peru so the pope
[02:56:36.360 --> 02:56:43.880]  is literally protecting pedophiles right in the open without without any shame of course he's been
[02:56:43.880 --> 02:56:52.760]  attacked by shon pio male cardinal shon pio male because of the words he said in the fence
[02:56:52.760 --> 02:56:58.200]  stating that nobody had the evidence while instead there's plenty of evidence and at that point
[02:56:58.200 --> 02:57:06.440]  even the pope had to apologize so pope francis in the last week alex has not had one word
[02:57:06.440 --> 02:57:12.440]  because he has made the what they call in italy a brutal figure in front of the of the world
[02:57:12.440 --> 02:57:18.040]  while he was in south america protecting the pedophile that they're trying to protect which
[02:57:18.040 --> 02:57:26.280]  is this guy who is this priest called mr figary so i mean i think that the luis fernando figari
[02:57:26.280 --> 02:57:33.240]  who is himself a peruvian catholic uh priest should be arrested immediately here in italy
[02:57:33.240 --> 02:57:38.760]  wherever he is instead he's protected by the Vatican the Vatican is now protecting their own
[02:57:38.760 --> 02:57:44.040]  interests because i have calculated stay there back in two minutes with leo zagami stay with us

[03:00:12.360 --> 03:00:17.560]  leo zagami investigated journalist best-selling author friends with burles cony
[03:00:17.560 --> 03:00:22.120]  giants and he's saying burles cony has been infiltrated by soros he's not saying he's a bad guy he just
[03:00:22.120 --> 03:00:26.120]  doesn't think at 80 plus years he's got the energy to fight this thing off but you are getting into
[03:00:26.120 --> 03:00:31.480]  trump's will from your deep analysis and your sources and inner poll and the italian government
[03:00:31.480 --> 03:00:36.120]  and the e you i mean you know you used to brag about it 10 years ago when you had some connections
[03:00:36.120 --> 03:00:40.040]  i know you've got them now if people have talked to what is the word on trump i mean give us your
[03:00:40.040 --> 03:00:45.400]  real analysis uh from what i've seen he wants to be the turnaround guy for america in the world
[03:00:45.400 --> 03:00:50.120]  he sees the wave of nationalism coming in it's not that he's perfect he's just not a satanist
[03:00:50.680 --> 03:01:02.040]  out to hurt average people he's not a a jerk the main enemy of donald gramp in this moment of time
[03:01:02.040 --> 03:01:09.000]  is the british royal family together with paul francis the british royal family is actively
[03:01:09.000 --> 03:01:18.200]  working with mi6 worldwide to destabilize the interests of donald j trump and oppose them in
[03:01:18.200 --> 03:01:26.120]  europe basically they want to only see his impeachment and so donald j trump has to really
[03:01:26.120 --> 03:01:34.680]  be aware because the queen of england is after him and you heard the words of the future wife
[03:01:34.680 --> 03:01:41.960]  of prince herry against donald j trump these people and let's explain these these folks really
[03:01:41.960 --> 03:01:45.560]  aren't even british they represent the larger rothschild cabal right
[03:01:50.520 --> 03:01:56.920]  the funny thing is alex that that i am actually related to because the queen and this is a matter
[03:01:56.920 --> 03:02:04.360]  of fact unfortunately and my mother is part of the problem often i tell her she's with the enemy
[03:02:04.360 --> 03:02:11.000]  i make a joke out of it but it's true because she's also responsible for the expats here in italy
[03:02:11.000 --> 03:02:16.360]  but there is a big problem really with the manipulation of power even in the rest of europe
[03:02:17.000 --> 03:02:22.040]  made by the great britain which repeatedly in the meantime has made the brexit and they have seen
[03:02:22.040 --> 03:02:28.440]  the positive results of the brexit because brexit is giving positive results though of course
[03:02:28.440 --> 03:02:33.640]  they can't be promoted these positive results because otherwise the rest of europe will fall
[03:02:33.640 --> 03:02:41.480]  apart i think that these future elections here in italy but also across europe the next elections
[03:02:41.480 --> 03:02:48.920]  will see the increase of parties that are so-called populists that want to return to the sovereignty
[03:02:48.920 --> 03:02:53.960]  but a lot of countries here in europe are searching for inspiration by donald j trump
[03:02:53.960 --> 03:03:00.440]  they're inspired by donald j trump really that was my next point nationalism is winning everywhere
[03:03:00.440 --> 03:03:06.680]  how are they gonna try to hold the line against nationalism
[03:03:06.680 --> 03:03:11.720]  the crazy thing is that if you go in the street here in italy everybody wants an italian donald
[03:03:11.720 --> 03:03:18.680]  j trump the problem is we don't have him and because every millionaire billionaire in italy
[03:03:18.680 --> 03:03:23.720]  has brought their money abroad and they're not willing to risk as much as berlusconi risked
[03:03:23.720 --> 03:03:30.440]  20 years ago and and when you went inside the political you're saying berlusconi even the
[03:03:30.440 --> 03:03:34.920]  media admits was the prototype of this nationalism and the rebirth of populism the problem is you
[03:03:34.920 --> 03:03:44.440]  just don't think he has the will and again his sky i don't seem to hear you i'm sorry
[03:03:45.160 --> 03:03:48.280]  why does does berlusconi not have the will what's the problem berlusconi
[03:03:48.280 --> 03:03:58.280]  i think that berlusconi has a great politician working for him well actually not working for
[03:03:58.280 --> 03:04:06.760]  him but in the coalition headed by him she's called georgia meloni is somebody that i think
[03:04:06.760 --> 03:04:12.760]  you will be talking about in the next few years point out this name she's called georgia meloni
[03:04:12.760 --> 03:04:19.400]  and i think that together with matthew salvini at the moment they will have a big success for
[03:04:19.400 --> 03:04:25.640]  this coalition headed by berlusconi but berlusconi has to be very careful because the fact that he's
[03:04:25.640 --> 03:04:31.160]  leaning towards the interest of the enemy because of his own interest because berlusconi is not only
[03:04:31.160 --> 03:04:36.840]  a politician remember berlusconi somebody wants to understand listen you got to join us every month
[03:04:36.840 --> 03:04:41.160]  is like a six months goes by or not on let's set him up whenever he wants the next two weeks

[03:04:54.760 --> 03:05:01.160]  fbi deputy director andrew mccabe has been removed from the bureau just one day after the fbi chief
[03:05:01.160 --> 03:05:07.080]  read the secret faiza memo mccabe's roles in both the clinton email investigation and russia probe
[03:05:07.080 --> 03:05:12.280]  came into question after it was reported last week that he's named in the four page memo
[03:05:12.280 --> 03:05:17.560]  alleging shocking revelations of collusion and corruption mccabe's removal comes the day after
[03:05:17.560 --> 03:05:23.880]  acting fbi director christopher ray read the faiza memo on capitol hill and on the day the house
[03:05:23.880 --> 03:05:29.480]  votes on its release though mccabe is set to retire sometime in march the timing of this
[03:05:29.480 --> 03:05:35.240]  development is pretty peculiar one source said mccabe was exercising his retirement eligibility
[03:05:35.240 --> 03:05:40.280]  and characterized his decision as stepping aside and mccabe was even taunted on twitter
[03:05:40.280 --> 03:05:46.440]  by president trump after news of his retirement broke in december trump tweeted fbi deputy director
[03:05:46.440 --> 03:05:53.480]  andrew mccabe is racing the clock to retire with full benefits 90 days to go leon macadoo info wars
[03:05:53.480 --> 03:06:12.360]  dot com from the front lines of the victorious war the answer to 1984 is 1776 your listening to
[03:06:12.360 --> 03:06:25.640]  the alex joe show it's been said that when the student is ready the master will appear it's
[03:06:25.640 --> 03:06:31.960]  also been said by many cultures by many sages that a real master knows how little they know
[03:06:32.840 --> 03:06:39.480]  and realizes that their youth was squandered generally on diversions and distractions and
[03:06:39.480 --> 03:06:45.400]  learning lessons that they could have been taught by a master that had already gone through those
[03:06:45.400 --> 03:06:54.040]  mistakes but i have to tell you if you want to know providence people like paul watson who now for
[03:06:54.920 --> 03:07:05.720]  1617 18 years since the 2001 uh the discernment guided me to get him to to try to train him to
[03:07:05.720 --> 03:07:10.440]  make him go on air to do the things and paul doesn't like stuff like this he's from northern england
[03:07:10.440 --> 03:07:16.440]  very uh you know closed mouth folks but but the whole point is it's a great satisfaction
[03:07:17.480 --> 03:07:27.640]  that paul in many ways has already transcended and outmatched much of my skills i'm 44 next week
[03:07:27.640 --> 03:07:34.600]  about a week and a half there's real pleasure in that to see his strength and his will already at
[03:07:34.600 --> 03:07:41.240]  what 33 34 years old already beginning to surpass mine but that's why paul needs to help me recruit
[03:07:41.800 --> 03:07:50.600]  other 17 18 year olds like i did recruit him because that's really what masters do is they
[03:07:50.600 --> 03:07:55.320]  realize they're not masters and they don't want to go through the same mistakes they made that
[03:07:55.320 --> 03:08:00.760]  that's mastery is taking the mistakes you've made finding someone that's smart enough to listen to you
[03:08:00.760 --> 03:08:06.520]  do and then get them to inculcate that and take action so that they can jump ahead of what you've
[03:08:06.520 --> 03:08:11.880]  done i'll use the analogy of some science fiction book i forget the name of it it was robert heinland
[03:08:11.880 --> 03:08:17.000]  wrote back in the 50s hero starship troopers and a lot of it and they've got this whole earth mission
[03:08:17.000 --> 03:08:24.360]  going out you know with with below light speed multi generations on a ring city base that uh
[03:08:24.360 --> 03:08:27.560]  verner von brawn others develop and that they admit it's the only model right now to create
[03:08:27.560 --> 03:08:32.440]  low gravity sustainable for cities to go into go into colonization programs and
[03:08:34.840 --> 03:08:38.600]  if you look at that in this heinland book they go through all these trials set down on
[03:08:38.600 --> 03:08:43.080]  planets to get water and fuel and they almost get destroyed and they're they're basically done they're
[03:08:43.080 --> 03:08:48.440]  not going to make your destination but then they've gotten warp drives all sudden 200 years of their
[03:08:48.440 --> 03:08:53.080]  mission a high tech ship show up to rescue them and oh sorry we got to you later we've already
[03:08:53.080 --> 03:08:57.560]  colonized half the galaxy but then we saw on the charts you were here's became and saved you and i and
[03:08:57.560 --> 03:09:02.280]  i think it's kind of like that that's what being a master means is you realize you're not a master
[03:09:02.280 --> 03:09:06.520]  and then if you can teach others what you've learned limited if they'll teach others then you
[03:09:06.520 --> 03:09:11.880]  can leapfrog ahead because we're i'm kind of some way stuck here in the muck from all the fights i've
[03:09:11.880 --> 03:09:16.520]  been in but if a paul watson can shoot ahead into the future and if you can shoot ahead in the future
[03:09:16.520 --> 03:09:22.120]  watching and listening that's our victory because what you're getting is transmissional data about
[03:09:22.120 --> 03:09:27.640]  how the global operation works that if you get it and spread it they will fail the technocracy all
[03:09:27.640 --> 03:09:32.760]  of it so we've got the state of the union coming up we've got pelosi melting down we've got the
[03:09:32.760 --> 03:09:41.240]  memo set to come out we've got so much the tides turning but if we just become the cliques that
[03:09:41.240 --> 03:09:49.640]  we've defeated then we're damned to hell so paul i go to my little apprentice story here uh these
[03:09:49.640 --> 03:09:54.280]  are epic times these are heady times we're dealing with i want you to take over cover whatever you
[03:09:54.280 --> 03:09:57.240]  want but i want you to hit that i'm getting out of here right now so you can balance out the rest
[03:09:57.240 --> 03:10:00.280]  of the hour we'll have coverage throughout the night at the state of the union all of it then
[03:10:00.280 --> 03:10:04.360]  full wars dot com port slash show hopefully you're promoting that on your twitter the rest of it
[03:10:04.360 --> 03:10:08.920]  how would you quantify the historical moment we've entered right now paul joseph watson
[03:10:10.440 --> 03:10:15.320]  well i'd say it was unprecedented alex i mean you talked about that pelosi clip which you've
[03:10:15.320 --> 03:10:21.400]  obviously played just the just the anger i mean she was dressing down chris qualmo in that clip
[03:10:21.400 --> 03:10:27.160]  a cnn host is one of the most anti-trump people you can get and the anger directed at him was
[03:10:27.160 --> 03:10:33.560]  still that vociferous so there's a kind of desperation taking hold alex and i saw it in uh
[03:10:33.560 --> 03:10:39.320]  michael moor who gave a speech last night as you know again um you know making these divisive
[03:10:39.320 --> 03:10:44.920]  comments about white privilege etc there's an anger there's a tone of voice that i haven't
[03:10:44.920 --> 03:10:50.200]  seen before up until this point which is you know with michael moor for example he thought
[03:10:50.200 --> 03:10:55.160]  before trump was even elected you probably remember this he got up on a late night talk show
[03:10:55.160 --> 03:11:00.760]  and said oh don't worry something might happen and he might not even be elected at all so even way
[03:11:00.760 --> 03:11:07.000]  back when before trump was even inaugurated michael moor still thought that his hysterical
[03:11:07.000 --> 03:11:12.920]  blowhard influence could maybe prevent a president that just won an election from taking power
[03:11:12.920 --> 03:11:19.880]  i mean that's that's how completely maniacal they were way back in december 2016 you fast forward
[03:11:19.880 --> 03:11:27.080]  now to late january nearly february 2018 i think they're finally starting to realize alex that they
[03:11:27.080 --> 03:11:33.480]  lost the election and it's finally starting to sink in this mewler investigation's basically
[03:11:33.480 --> 03:11:39.000]  going nowhere it could be overturned with the release of this phaser memo and that realization
[03:11:39.000 --> 03:11:44.520]  is bringing them to absolute desperation and the realization that they've just wasted you know the
[03:11:44.520 --> 03:11:49.720]  the better part of 18 months of their lives fighting for a cause which was lost from the very
[03:11:49.720 --> 03:11:55.640]  beginning which is why they're now acting so desperate so hysterical so maniacal above and
[03:11:55.640 --> 03:12:00.840]  beyond anything that we've even seen before and that fraud they conducted is now threatening to
[03:12:00.840 --> 03:12:05.400]  bring them down but people want to know about you personally paul they want that and so i i'm
[03:12:05.400 --> 03:12:09.560]  simply saying the last thing for you to do is really open up for people like you've done with me
[03:12:09.560 --> 03:12:14.040]  a few times and really tell folks what you think and your real energy instead of being so guarded
[03:12:14.040 --> 03:12:18.680]  about things just spend a few minutes for you to break and then i'll let you take over what has it
[03:12:18.680 --> 03:12:24.360]  been like the journey of fighting globalism being called the kooks no one believing us to now global
[03:12:24.360 --> 03:12:30.760]  victory on every front uh i mean what has that been like and what is it 17 years how 16 years
[03:12:30.760 --> 03:12:39.000]  how many years you've been in force i think it started in october 2002 so i mean this year it'll
[03:12:39.000 --> 03:12:45.880]  be coming up to what 16 years so it's it's been a long time i mean basically we the way i got into
[03:12:45.880 --> 03:12:51.800]  it was seeing a hit piece about you alex on channel four british television way back in probably
[03:12:51.800 --> 03:12:58.840]  2000 early 2001 so the very act of them attacking you trying to dress you down trying to smear you
[03:12:58.840 --> 03:13:04.040]  is what got me involved in this entire thing in the first place so that's why we need to always
[03:13:04.040 --> 03:13:09.240]  remember that i mean there's there's a there's a poem by william wordsworth called character of the
[03:13:09.240 --> 03:13:14.920]  happy warrior maybe they can flash that up on screen and it's all about taking those hits
[03:13:14.920 --> 03:13:20.920]  taking those smears taking the attack taking the flag from your enemy and turning it against them
[03:13:20.920 --> 03:13:25.560]  turning lemons into lemonade as it were there's a summary of this poem it's it's a long poem i'm
[03:13:25.560 --> 03:13:31.320]  not going to read it but who is the happy warrior who is he the every man and i'm talking about lord
[03:13:31.320 --> 03:13:37.480]  nelson in this poem basically who who you know was blind in one eye lost an arm just still kept
[03:13:37.480 --> 03:13:42.120]  fighting on forever until his death because that was the sole purpose of his entire existence
[03:13:42.120 --> 03:13:47.640]  it's basically about the uh the excerpt from this uh breakdown all fearsome challenges he transmutes
[03:13:47.640 --> 03:13:52.200]  subduing what negative qualities they may have and learning from what good they have to offer so
[03:13:52.200 --> 03:13:57.480]  it's all about taking those challenges taking those attacks on you turning them against your enemy
[03:13:57.480 --> 03:14:02.360]  philosophically and that's what that poem summarizes so i mean that's that's what we need to do because
[03:14:02.360 --> 03:14:07.560]  this is dark heavy information the attacks are relentless from the media they try to drag you
[03:14:07.560 --> 03:14:12.360]  down they try to make yourself doubt they try to make you think you're on the wrong side of history
[03:14:12.360 --> 03:14:16.680]  no news flash you're on the wrong side of history and that's what's powerful paul is it's not just
[03:14:16.680 --> 03:14:21.480]  people that have children that live on its ideas and books and literature and art that
[03:14:21.480 --> 03:14:26.280]  transcends and it shows our real humanity and that's why i know even if they get me they haven't
[03:14:26.280 --> 03:14:30.200]  gotten you they haven't gotten o and they haven't gotten other people they haven't gotten this crew
[03:14:30.200 --> 03:14:36.040]  that's what's so strong is that even if they get me or they get you the truth transmits on it lives
[03:14:36.040 --> 03:14:41.560]  forever that is transcendent that is the most valuable thing in the world that's what's so
[03:14:41.560 --> 03:14:47.400]  amazing about it well i don't want to let everybody down myself is because you know it's like we're
[03:14:47.400 --> 03:14:53.160]  all each other's fathers and brothers and daughters and sons the son the father the father the son
[03:14:53.160 --> 03:14:57.960]  it's just when you do the right thing these evil people don't know what they're turning down
[03:14:57.960 --> 03:15:05.320]  they don't know what honor is offering exactly and ideas are bulletproof and you know i i
[03:15:05.320 --> 03:15:11.400]  tweeted about this earlier actually you know why people seem to forget alex that we opposed a republican
[03:15:11.400 --> 03:15:18.280]  administration for eight solid years we vehemently opposed the iraq war launched under a republican
[03:15:18.280 --> 03:15:24.600]  administration for eight solid years while the media the same media that now grandstands as the big
[03:15:24.600 --> 03:15:31.640]  moral guardian of truth supported that republican administration supported that phony bs war for
[03:15:31.640 --> 03:15:36.280]  that same period of eight years time you know they always side with the deep state doesn't matter
[03:15:36.280 --> 03:15:41.320]  who's in the presidency whether it's republican democrat they side with the deep state we side
[03:15:41.320 --> 03:15:47.560]  with the truth that's the difference soulless mercenary cowards we are not mercenaries we'll

[03:20:05.800 --> 03:20:25.240]  live from the info wars.com studios you're listening to the alex jones show and now your host paul joseph
[03:20:25.240 --> 03:20:35.640]  watson we're live it is the 30th of january 2018 it is the alex jones show breaking news sources
[03:20:35.640 --> 03:20:41.160]  say trump wants to make the Pfizer abuse memo public as soon as possible but not before his
[03:20:41.160 --> 03:20:46.600]  state of the union address tonight he wants the state of the union address the content of that
[03:20:46.600 --> 03:20:52.840]  to dominate the news cycle for the next 48 hours so you're looking at a release of the Pfizer memo
[03:20:52.840 --> 03:20:58.840]  on probably thursday or friday maybe they'll wait until the next news cycle on monday but it
[03:20:58.840 --> 03:21:04.440]  definitely looks like it's not going to be until the end of the week state of the union is tonight
[03:21:04.440 --> 03:21:09.800]  it's tuesday so it's going to be at least 48 hours so you would guess most likely it would be
[03:21:09.800 --> 03:21:15.240]  thursday but that remains to be seen first of all we're going to talk about michael more let me know
[03:21:15.240 --> 03:21:19.480]  by the way if we got that michael more clip uh of his speech from last night because that's
[03:21:19.480 --> 03:21:26.120]  basically what i'm talking about headline up on info wars dot com michael more america must be
[03:21:26.120 --> 03:21:32.600]  cleansed of its white male privilege now this is not the first time that michael more has waded
[03:21:33.240 --> 03:21:39.000]  into identity politics of course he didn't used to be into it because it's proven to be a failing
[03:21:39.000 --> 03:21:45.560]  strategy politically especially over the last 18 months so he got up at this open air tent
[03:21:45.560 --> 03:21:51.240]  temper tantrum which these mega rich out of touch celebrities hold on a regular basis now
[03:21:51.240 --> 03:21:56.840]  claiming to be the voice of the people they're not the voice of the people they're the voice of
[03:21:56.840 --> 03:22:02.360]  their own hysteria got up again in manhattan and said basically the white people he's talking about
[03:22:02.360 --> 03:22:07.560]  white male privilege but you can get the cue he's basically talking about the need for white people
[03:22:07.560 --> 03:22:13.560]  to be cleansed from america and he said comments similar to that even more egregious to that
[03:22:13.560 --> 03:22:20.200]  before you remember we reported on it he celebrated directly the demographic decline of white people
[03:22:20.200 --> 03:22:25.480]  he said quote this was back in august last year michael more quote the angry white guy is dying
[03:22:25.480 --> 03:22:30.680]  out in the census bureau has already told us that by 2050 white people are going to be the minority
[03:22:30.680 --> 03:22:35.720]  and i'm not sad to say i can't wait for that day to happen i hope i live long enough to see it
[03:22:35.720 --> 03:22:42.840]  because it will be a better country now he followed that up having compared trump supporters to
[03:22:42.840 --> 03:22:46.520]  rapists by the way there you see the interview where he said it would be a better country once
[03:22:46.520 --> 03:22:51.160]  white people are a minority he followed it up by bragging about how white people were outvoted
[03:22:51.160 --> 03:22:59.000]  in the alabama senate election so this is not the first time that he's rift on race now let's play
[03:22:59.000 --> 03:23:03.320]  the clip from last night if we have it uh from the speech in manhattan this is michael more let's
[03:23:03.320 --> 03:23:14.840]  roll the clip but removing him and kess and the whole disgusting one that in congress and in our
[03:23:14.840 --> 03:23:26.760]  city cabels still won't be enough no we must remove and replace the system and the culture
[03:23:26.760 --> 03:23:36.280]  that gave us trouble in the first place
[03:23:37.480 --> 03:23:43.400]  he he did not just fall out of the sky and land in queens
[03:23:45.560 --> 03:23:52.280]  he is the result of a decades-long corporate takeover of our democracy
[03:23:52.280 --> 03:24:03.800]  and and a loss never correcting the three original sins of america a nation founded on genocide
[03:24:05.400 --> 03:24:13.000]  built on the backs of the slaves and maintained through the subjugation of women to second
[03:24:13.000 --> 03:24:29.800]  class citizenship and economic disempowerment as we seek to rid ourselves of the trump
[03:24:31.160 --> 03:24:38.520]  we must also cleanse our american soul of its white male privilege its voracious greed
[03:24:38.520 --> 03:24:47.960]  and its enforced ignorance that has made a population of semi and unwear people
[03:24:48.840 --> 03:24:55.720]  so they have the hysterical angry vicious michael more again talking about oh we were
[03:24:55.720 --> 03:25:00.920]  founded on original sin white people were the first in the world to end slavery how many
[03:25:00.920 --> 03:25:06.120]  times do we need to make that historical point okay william will before literally going over to
[03:25:06.120 --> 03:25:11.160]  slave colonies liberating slaves he's talking about the subjugation of women as second class
[03:25:11.160 --> 03:25:16.920]  citizens what in the hell are you talking about you've still got women in iran to this day
[03:25:16.920 --> 03:25:23.720]  being locked up because they remove their hijab nowhere else on earth of women being given more
[03:25:23.720 --> 03:25:28.200]  opportunities than in the united states of america what on earth are you talking about
[03:25:28.200 --> 03:25:33.240]  you stupid blowhard now i would you know you could accept that this was him just playing
[03:25:33.240 --> 03:25:40.920]  the identity politics game but this is a guy who is a total turncoat a total deceptive piece of crap
[03:25:40.920 --> 03:25:46.680]  he endorsed bernie sanders there you see michael more is jabber the hot perfect representation
[03:25:46.680 --> 03:25:51.880]  he endorsed bernie sanders in the early part of the election soon as it became clear that the
[03:25:51.880 --> 03:25:57.080]  fix was in and that bernie sanders was not going to be allowed to win the democratic nomination
[03:25:57.080 --> 03:26:02.520]  far from complaining about that michael more immediately switched and endorsed hillary clinton
[03:26:02.520 --> 03:26:10.520]  the very woman he had denounced as a globalist elitist wall street puppet goldman sacks puppet
[03:26:10.520 --> 03:26:15.720]  as a reason to endorse bernie sanders he immediately flipped and said oh don't worry
[03:26:15.720 --> 03:26:22.360]  hillary clinton's going to carry through bernie's populist platforms no she isn't i mean this was
[03:26:22.360 --> 03:26:29.720]  at a point when hillary clinton had a like an 11 trust rating across america and he said oh you
[03:26:29.720 --> 03:26:35.160]  can trust her she's going to adopt bernie's populist platforms so he just but he just brazenly
[03:26:35.160 --> 03:26:41.400]  did a 180 endorsed hillary clinton after denouncing her as evil incarnate what does that tell you
[03:26:41.400 --> 03:26:47.640]  about him then as i said before when i was on with alex even before trump was elected he was
[03:26:47.640 --> 03:26:53.240]  saying oh something might happen you never know then he was calling for basically a trump to
[03:26:53.240 --> 03:26:58.920]  be arrested for the deep state to overthrow him this is a guy who earned his corn being the man
[03:26:58.920 --> 03:27:03.960]  of the people remember his early documentaries his early books were all about how you know flint
[03:27:03.960 --> 03:27:10.200]  michigan was devastated when they started offshoring all the jobs due to globalist trade policies
[03:27:10.200 --> 03:27:16.040]  his books were about nike offshoring jobs and making americans unemployed it was about
[03:27:16.040 --> 03:27:22.200]  neoliberal globalization that was everything he opposed and he turns around and endorses hillary
[03:27:22.200 --> 03:27:28.920]  clinton the very representation of globalist neoliberal policies that's michael more that's
[03:27:28.920 --> 03:27:35.720]  how utterly deceptive and decrepit morally decrepit he is as an individual as a human
[03:27:36.520 --> 03:27:41.080]  this is a guy who made his you know early documentaries talking about the ludicrousness
[03:27:41.080 --> 03:27:46.040]  of war he turns around and endorses hillary clinton somebody has said oh we might we launch
[03:27:46.040 --> 03:27:53.560]  a military attack on russia if we suspect they cyber attacked america everything he supposedly
[03:27:53.560 --> 03:27:59.400]  opposed when he was coming up he then turned around and endorsed that's why he's a complete
[03:27:59.400 --> 03:28:05.640]  sack of crap he tried to cultivate this average joe image soon as he got mega rich off the back
[03:28:05.640 --> 03:28:10.760]  of the very capitalist system he denounces now he's a globalist oh but he still gets up and
[03:28:10.760 --> 03:28:16.920]  grandstands as a man of the people while calling for the overthrow for the sabotage of a democratically
[03:28:16.920 --> 03:28:22.920]  elected president elected by the people i mean there's never been a more deceptive
[03:28:23.800 --> 03:28:30.040]  more vicious more underhanded sack of crap than michael more and now he's playing the
[03:28:30.040 --> 03:28:34.360]  race game basically saying oh don't worry that all the white people are dying out we're gonna
[03:28:34.360 --> 03:28:40.040]  replace them with these minorities these human shields who we pretend to care about just so
[03:28:40.040 --> 03:28:43.960]  they'll vote for us and everything's going to be all right but as i said earlier there's a
[03:28:43.960 --> 03:28:50.120]  desperation in his voice he's failed for over a year this hysteria is collapsing it's failing

[03:36:04.600 --> 03:36:10.280]  dietary staple again because it's in all the cooking in all the curries have a lower prevalence of
[03:36:10.280 --> 03:36:16.280]  Alzheimer's and better cognitive performance now that's not even getting into the other scientific
[03:36:16.280 --> 03:36:21.080]  studies where they made people take placebo where they made people take prozac and where they made
[03:36:21.080 --> 03:36:27.400]  people take curcumin but again we're not making those claims but there are those studies in existence
[03:36:27.400 --> 03:36:32.920]  you can go out and read them but this study is talking about its effects with helping cognitive
[03:36:32.920 --> 03:36:38.600]  functioning we're talking about it helping with inflammatory support on the bottle flexibility

[03:37:44.040 --> 03:37:50.360]  yesterday now we've got Nancy Pelosi upon cnn giving Chris Cuomo a dressing down basically
[03:37:50.360 --> 03:37:55.320]  saying to him what was it that she said you don't know what you're talking about absolutely insane
[03:37:55.320 --> 03:38:01.000]  maniacal look in her face when she said that to a guy who would normally be sympathetic he's anti
[03:38:01.000 --> 03:38:08.440]  trump all the way now we've got msnbc suggesting david devin newness has become a russian agent yes
[03:38:08.440 --> 03:38:14.280]  they actually said that they've actually expanded their russian collusion hysteria their maniacal
[03:38:14.280 --> 03:38:19.960]  conspiracy theory to congress now seeing the actual members of congress are basically russian
[03:38:19.960 --> 03:38:27.240]  agents now we've got this out of the guardian second trump russia dossier being assessed by fbi
[03:38:27.960 --> 03:38:32.040]  well isn't that convenient we've got the Pfizer memo coming out at the end of this week by the
[03:38:32.040 --> 03:38:38.600]  looks of it now they've come out with a second anti trump dossier which the fbi which has not
[03:38:38.600 --> 03:38:45.000]  been politicized at all is treating seriously and it reads the russian collusion russian collusion
[03:38:45.000 --> 03:38:49.560]  into the 2016 us presidential election has been given a second memo that independently
[03:38:49.560 --> 03:38:55.720]  set out some of the same allegations made in the dossier by a former british spy the second memo
[03:38:55.720 --> 03:39:02.840]  was written by kody shearer a controversial political activist and former journalist who was close to
[03:39:03.880 --> 03:39:09.640]  dagger of gas the clinton white house in the 90s oh that sounds really impartial doesn't it that
[03:39:09.640 --> 03:39:15.320]  sounds really independent so they've basically got a second christopher steele style dossier
[03:39:15.320 --> 03:39:21.880]  which is chock full of made-up complete baloney about trump now the fbi is looking at this as part
[03:39:21.880 --> 03:39:27.320]  of their inquiry into russian collusion they're looking at it seriously even though it was written
[03:39:27.320 --> 03:39:33.800]  by a hardcore clintonite political activist what does that tell you about their motivation
[03:39:33.800 --> 03:39:40.920]  as this new Pfizer memo is about to be released house judiciary tells fbi to preserve mccabe
[03:39:40.920 --> 03:39:46.120]  emails pertaining to trump election now you had the mainstream media yesterday claimed that his
[03:39:46.120 --> 03:39:51.880]  resignation had nothing to do with the imminent release of this Pfizer memo well now the news
[03:39:51.880 --> 03:39:57.880]  around the now former fbi deputy director andrew mccabe appears to be getting tighter reports zero
[03:39:57.880 --> 03:40:04.040]  hedge just hours after news that mccabe was departing the fbi allegedly forced out from
[03:40:04.040 --> 03:40:08.440]  his position the chair of the house judiciary committee chairman republican bob goodluck
[03:40:08.440 --> 03:40:14.440]  released a letter urging fbi director christopher ray to preserve mr mccabe's emails and all of
[03:40:14.440 --> 03:40:20.280]  the communications before his official departure from the agency so of course we had the questions
[03:40:20.280 --> 03:40:27.240]  flying around about him potentially telling people within the fbi to alter prior witness
[03:40:27.240 --> 03:40:33.080]  statements it looks like they're trying to cover their behinds in this rush in this panic as the
[03:40:33.080 --> 03:40:38.600]  Pfizer memo comes closer to its public release so now they're saying all his communications
[03:40:38.600 --> 03:40:43.160]  need to be preserved need to be archived obviously they're paranoid about some of them
[03:40:43.160 --> 03:40:49.400]  being deleted like the mysterious disappearance of those 50 000 fbi text messages which were later
[03:40:49.400 --> 03:40:56.120]  found also out of zero hedge shocked to his core fbi director ray blown away by contents of the
[03:40:56.120 --> 03:41:01.080]  Pfizer memo source says fbi director christopher ray was shocked to his core after viewing your
[03:41:01.080 --> 03:41:07.240]  four page Pfizer memo a source told fox news is shorn hanity the next day he reportedly asked
[03:41:07.240 --> 03:41:13.560]  deputy director mccabe to resign but again according to the mainstream media the two things had no
[03:41:13.560 --> 03:41:20.680]  connection whatsoever so we'll see i mean the worst stories floating around yesterday that
[03:41:20.680 --> 03:41:27.720]  trump was being told by members of his own cabinet supposedly on his side not deep state people to not
[03:41:27.720 --> 03:41:33.640]  sign off on the release of this memo because it could create some kind of rank or some kind of you
[03:41:33.640 --> 03:41:41.320]  know real like civil unrest style situation they were talking about given the bombshell revelations
[03:41:41.320 --> 03:41:46.200]  that it might contain i mean noone has us played it up trey gowdy's played it up so it remains to
[03:41:46.200 --> 03:41:51.800]  be seen exactly how bombshell it is obviously the left the democrats are going to come out and say
[03:41:52.840 --> 03:41:56.760]  this proves nothing this proves nothing that we didn't already know they're going to say it's
[03:41:56.760 --> 03:42:03.000]  basically a a dud upon its release republicans are going to play it up but now we've got a second
[03:42:03.000 --> 03:42:10.440]  dossier being assessed by the fbi we've got msnbc claiming or at least one of their analysts one
[03:42:10.440 --> 03:42:16.680]  of their guests claiming that devin noon is is a russian agent for wanting to write this memo and
[03:42:16.680 --> 03:42:23.080]  then have it released we've got mccabe resigning in the media saying there's no connection and we've
[03:42:23.080 --> 03:42:29.640]  got the house judiciary telling them to save his emails to preserve his communications obviously
[03:42:29.640 --> 03:42:35.560]  paranoid that he's deleting some of them to cover his behind given these reports that he ordered
[03:42:35.560 --> 03:42:42.680]  people to change witness statements absolutely revelatory bombshell week coming up trump's
[03:42:42.680 --> 03:42:47.080]  going to concentrate on his state of the union and try to have that narrative dominate over the
[03:42:47.080 --> 03:42:53.480]  next 48 hours but then potentially the Pfizer memo drops it's going to be big we'll be back live

[03:47:25.080 --> 03:47:29.800]  up next i'm going to get into a few final news stories but by the way let's get that grammy
[03:47:29.800 --> 03:47:36.040]  video setup which i made yesterday um obviously talking about the uh relentless tirade of virtue
[03:47:36.040 --> 03:47:41.160]  signaling which is turning off americans in droves their ratings are collapsing the same thing with
[03:47:41.160 --> 03:47:47.880]  the nfl the identity politics is not working but they keep doing the same thing they keep trying
[03:47:47.880 --> 03:47:52.760]  the same tactic they keep trying to exalt hillary clinton as the representative of their movement
[03:47:53.480 --> 03:47:58.440]  not a great idea she already lost one election you want her to lose another maybe we should just
[03:47:58.440 --> 03:48:04.760]  encourage them but it's so boring it's so boring i'm sick of talking about it i mean we should be
[03:48:04.760 --> 03:48:10.760]  talking about artificial intelligence going to mars instead we're talking about how diverse the
[03:48:10.760 --> 03:48:15.720]  host of the grammy's is and all this crap nobody cares we're going to go to that in a second bit
[03:48:15.720 --> 03:48:21.640]  of breaking news though bnl breaking news is reporting that uh donald trump may make the memo
[03:48:21.640 --> 03:48:26.680]  the fires of memo public either directly after his state of the union speech tonight or tomorrow
[03:48:26.680 --> 03:48:30.520]  morning i don't think that's going to happen i think he's going to want his state of the union
[03:48:30.520 --> 03:48:35.960]  speech the narrative emerging out of that to dominate tomorrow's headline maybe it will be
[03:48:35.960 --> 03:48:40.440]  released tomorrow night maybe thursday maybe not until next week all it remains to be seen but
[03:48:40.440 --> 03:48:46.520]  some are suggesting that you have cnn trump wants newness memo released as quickly as possible but
[03:48:46.520 --> 03:48:52.200]  not before state of the union some of his insiders some of trump's cabinet were encouraging him not
[03:48:52.200 --> 03:48:57.640]  to release it at all so it remains to be seen but now suggestions that could come out tonight or
[03:48:57.640 --> 03:49:02.440]  tomorrow we'll wait and see i think it's more likely to come out on thursday let's go to the
[03:49:02.440 --> 03:49:07.560]  video though this is about the grammy's the relentless tirade of virtue signaling that
[03:49:07.560 --> 03:49:14.120]  americans are sick and tired of it's not working their ratings continue to collapse it's not resonating
[03:49:14.120 --> 03:49:20.280]  with anyone with anyone it's so boring it's so predictable it's so stale but they just keep
[03:49:20.280 --> 03:49:25.800]  doing it they can't help themselves here's the clip so the grammy's was a relentless tirade of
[03:49:25.800 --> 03:49:30.920]  sanctimonious anti-trump virtue signaling with mega rich out of touch celebrities desperately
[03:49:30.920 --> 03:49:43.000]  trying to outdo each other with cordy woke diatribe didn't see that one coming i mean how brave
[03:49:43.000 --> 03:49:48.040]  must you need to be to get up in front of a self-satisfied circle jerk that already agrees
[03:49:48.040 --> 03:49:53.080]  with everything you say and regurgitate the same clip mantra that they're about to regurgitate
[03:49:53.080 --> 03:49:59.000]  five minutes later so stunning so brave the general public aren't even allowed into this
[03:49:59.000 --> 03:50:04.040]  ass-kissing contest yet you've got the gall to get up there and claim you speak for the little
[03:50:04.040 --> 03:50:09.320]  people give me a break hashtag me too slack to this didn't waste an opportunity to lecture us
[03:50:09.320 --> 03:50:15.720]  about the objectification of women we come in peace but we mean business while girls with
[03:50:15.720 --> 03:50:20.360]  little more than pain covering their tits jiggled around on stage while the audience whooped and
[03:50:20.360 --> 03:50:26.040]  hollered for hillary clinton one reason why he liked to eat at mcdonald's nobody knew he was coming
[03:50:26.040 --> 03:50:31.640]  a woman who publicly attacked and privately intimidated actual rape victims hillary led the
[03:50:31.640 --> 03:50:37.640]  effort to disparage her husband's woman accusers who were dismissed as bill bimbo eruptions hollywood
[03:50:37.640 --> 03:50:42.520]  so upset about harassment of women it invited a serial enabler of it to read a book at the
[03:50:42.520 --> 03:50:47.320]  grammy's hillary reading a fake book at the grammy's versus trump reading a presidential
[03:50:47.320 --> 03:50:52.520]  speech at the state of the union great consolation prize hillary but hey at least grammy nominee big
[03:50:52.520 --> 03:50:57.560]  shorn was in attendance another noted poster child for the movement against the sexual abuse of
[03:50:57.560 --> 03:51:02.520]  women oh no my bad he's the guy who worked with m&m on a song about raping and culter he's the guy
[03:51:02.520 --> 03:51:08.120]  who was arrested for sexually abusing a 17 year old girl maybe big shorn should take tips from the
[03:51:08.120 --> 03:51:14.440]  other me to icon grammy winner kendrick lemar whose most recent album honors women by referring to
[03:51:14.440 --> 03:51:20.680]  them as rats hose and not to be outdone fellow grammy nominee rick ross likes to rap about date
[03:51:20.680 --> 03:51:27.000]  rape but the award for ardent me too male feminist has to go to grammy nominee tyler the creator
[03:51:27.000 --> 03:51:32.600]  who in his song troncat advises his fans to quote rape a pregnant bitch i mean maybe harvey
[03:51:32.600 --> 03:51:37.960]  winstein can return to public life as a hip hop artist the grammy's would love him lord wore a quote
[03:51:37.960 --> 03:51:43.320]  by a feminist author saying our times are intolerable and calling on people to overthrow the oppressors
[03:51:43.320 --> 03:51:47.960]  so i guess she must have been talking about iran where actual oppressors are imprisoning actual
[03:51:47.960 --> 03:51:52.840]  feminists for standing up for actual women's rights no she was whining about not being asked
[03:51:52.840 --> 03:51:58.280]  to perform at the grammy's well cry me a river while lord was praised for her vacuous platitude
[03:51:58.280 --> 03:52:03.320]  joy veers message of hey why don't we protect females by not killing them in the womb didn't
[03:52:03.320 --> 03:52:09.400]  go down so well pretty bad weekend for jz eight nominations and zero awards he also got roasted
[03:52:09.400 --> 03:52:14.520]  by trump who reminded him that black unemployment was at a record low oh but money doesn't matter
[03:52:14.520 --> 03:52:19.320]  according to jz it's not about money at the end of the day except if you're selling crack cocaine
[03:52:19.320 --> 03:52:24.600]  to black people then bragging about how it gave you great business acumen years later but jz really
[03:52:24.600 --> 03:52:29.800]  cares about african americans he also really cares about women which i presume is why he was nominated
[03:52:29.800 --> 03:52:35.080]  for eight grammy's jz is all about the me too movement after all this is the same guy who gave
[03:52:35.080 --> 03:52:40.440]  us the immortal feminist line you know i thug him f*** him love him leave him because i don't
[03:52:40.440 --> 03:52:46.280]  f***ing need him i mean jz cares so much about women he cheats on his wife the mother of his
[03:52:46.280 --> 03:52:51.880]  two daughters perfect role model now the resistance is set to stage another public temper tantrum
[03:52:51.880 --> 03:52:58.040]  with the george sorrow sponsored people state of the union at this point what exactly are you
[03:52:58.040 --> 03:53:03.720]  resisting this is classic trump derangement syndrome this is they still cannot get past the
[03:53:03.720 --> 03:53:08.520]  fact that they lost an election that happened over a year ago and what i would like to know is what
[03:53:08.520 --> 03:53:14.600]  are we resisting now are we resisting the elimination of isis are we resisting this booming trump
[03:53:14.600 --> 03:53:20.760]  economy where unemployment rate for women is now at an 18 year low where the unemployment rate for
[03:53:20.760 --> 03:53:27.160]  african americans is the lowest that it's ever been documented are we resisting that 270 companies
[03:53:27.160 --> 03:53:33.880]  have now announced that they are going to give back to their employees raises and bonuses and put
[03:53:33.880 --> 03:53:39.400]  more money in their 401ks since the trump tax cuts have taken effect what are we resisting then we
[03:53:39.400 --> 03:53:44.680]  had to endure the spectacle of james cordon apologizing for being white it's funny because
[03:53:44.680 --> 03:53:50.040]  i know numerous people who've worked with james cordon and every single one of them every single
[03:53:50.040 --> 03:53:55.640]  one says he treats his colleagues like dirt and is a complete twat maybe you should apologize for
[03:53:55.640 --> 03:54:01.560]  that how did the american people respond to all this grammy viewership plunged 20 percent compared
[03:54:01.560 --> 03:54:07.640]  to last year ratings it at all time low just like the nfl everyone's sick to the back teeth of you
[03:54:07.640 --> 03:54:13.640]  injecting identity politics into absolutely everything the more you blithely regurgitate the
[03:54:13.640 --> 03:54:20.520]  same brain dead progressive cliches the less people care newsflash idiots you're not shague of aura
[03:54:20.520 --> 03:54:27.400]  your mindless celebrities savers the hysteria savers the tedious virtue signaling drop the politics
[03:54:27.400 --> 03:54:34.840]  you're shut up and sing there you have it that video is up on youtube if you want to share it now
[03:54:34.840 --> 03:54:40.280]  of course we also got the figures out of hollywood i think they had the the worst summer for about 15
[03:54:40.280 --> 03:54:44.680]  years nobody's buying this identity politics they see a headline van jones suggests trump should be
[03:54:44.680 --> 03:54:50.440]  more like jz probably not given the way the polls are going in in these kind of things the hollywood
[03:54:50.440 --> 03:54:55.560]  polls the nfl polls they asked people who watched nfl do you want to see more or less politics or
[03:54:55.560 --> 03:55:00.920]  the same it was like eight percent wanted to see more politics people are sick of this
[03:55:00.920 --> 03:55:06.600]  they're turning off in droves that's why vince mcwan's xfl caused a lot of buzz last week because
[03:55:06.600 --> 03:55:12.120]  they came out and said look no social justice no politics everybody stands for the anthem
[03:55:12.120 --> 03:55:16.840]  we're here to entertain you that's it and that's all the americans want they're sick to the back
[03:55:16.840 --> 03:55:22.440]  teeth of this celebrities still don't get it they're so disconnected they still think it's a winning
[03:55:22.440 --> 03:55:28.600]  election strategy to virtue signal relentlessly about diversity and to have hillary clinton
[03:55:28.600 --> 03:55:33.960]  up there there was some likable person on the planet it's it's frustrating because it's so
[03:55:33.960 --> 03:55:40.040]  boring to have to talk about it still like 18 months later but you know we should be calm
[03:55:40.040 --> 03:55:45.960]  about it we should just let them carry on because it hasn't been a winning strategy the polls suggest
[03:55:45.960 --> 03:55:51.400]  it isn't going to be in the future so we you know they're hoisted by their own petard at this point
[03:55:51.400 --> 03:55:57.400]  but it is incredibly boring let's go into some other news stories right now fake news public
[03:55:57.400 --> 03:56:02.360]  broadcaster admits to increasing booing sounds during trump davos speech this was a german public
[03:56:02.360 --> 03:56:06.920]  broadcaster we've talked about those kind of stations before where trump gave a speech that
[03:56:06.920 --> 03:56:12.280]  basically a handful of malcontents at the back of the room who booed at the end of his speech
[03:56:12.840 --> 03:56:18.440]  and to make the story all about this minority of people this german broadcaster ard
[03:56:18.440 --> 03:56:25.160]  the arse officially boosted the volume to turn up the clip to amplify these booze that were at the
[03:56:25.160 --> 03:56:30.520]  back of the room to make the story about oh he was boom he was booed after his davos speech that
[03:56:30.520 --> 03:56:38.680]  that's deceptive that's fake news these are the same kind of german stations that hide migrant crime
[03:56:38.680 --> 03:56:43.320]  that they don't tell you the identity of the attacker of the rapist because they don't want
[03:56:43.320 --> 03:56:49.080]  germans thinking that may be bringing in you know two million people from a culture that disrespects
[03:56:49.080 --> 03:56:54.360]  and treats women like trash is maybe not a good idea so they're complicit in hiding that and
[03:56:54.360 --> 03:57:01.400]  they're complicit in running this fake news story out of germany again facebook calling for the
[03:57:01.400 --> 03:57:06.280]  murder of afd members talking of germany does not violate our community standards basically
[03:57:06.280 --> 03:57:12.520]  somebody said quote it's time to strike the afd is dead i'm arming myself now away with this pack
[03:57:12.520 --> 03:57:16.760]  of pigs facebook responded we have viewed the comment and it's completely fine doesn't violate
[03:57:16.760 --> 03:57:21.800]  their community standards of course one rule for them another rule for everyone else the safest
[03:57:21.800 --> 03:57:27.880]  country for women in continental europe is poland imagine my shot i wonder why that is could it
[03:57:27.880 --> 03:57:33.240]  be anything to do with the fact that they haven't imported two million migrants again from countries
[03:57:33.240 --> 03:57:38.920]  that have no respect for women do you think there's a connection there maybe that's going to wrap it
