[00:41.920 --> 00:45.920]  debating him a bit about global warming but we mainly got him on about the economy and the fact
[00:45.920 --> 00:50.520]  that he talked about video games being turned into a casino gulag now there's a lot of main
[00:50.520 --> 00:55.680]  stream media and industry reports admitting that this is basically the plan so we'll be
[00:55.680 --> 01:03.360]  discussing that with Max coming up at t-minus two hours from now okay let me just read to you
[01:03.360 --> 01:13.240]  the top stories in each of my stacks here because the news gets more insane by the day and I seem
[01:13.240 --> 01:20.360]  to say this every broadcast now it's exponentially becoming more brazen and more naked just how
[01:20.360 --> 01:29.280]  criminal the ruling class of this planet is and they're selling us despotism euthanasia war mass
[01:29.280 --> 01:41.200]  murder total surveillance government kidnapping of children as if it's a good thing the end of
[01:41.200 --> 01:49.640]  national sovereignty as a good thing Colin Powell is telling the GOP to back the Dream Act which is
[01:49.640 --> 01:55.120]  basically a giant amnesty act and it will convert the military that's already swollen with foreigners
[01:55.120 --> 02:01.920]  to a internal foreign Hessian military similar to what our forefathers faced in the eight year
[02:01.920 --> 02:07.880]  revolutionary war against the British that is coming up as we reported a week ago but now
[02:07.880 --> 02:12.920]  it's coming up for a vote as early as tomorrow they have introduced the Dream Act on to the
[02:12.920 --> 02:22.000]  defense authorization bill so we're going to be discussing that today also the federal
[02:22.000 --> 02:27.160]  government says the recession ended a year ago doesn't matter if every other major economist
[02:27.160 --> 02:33.000]  admits that we're not as in a recession we're in a depression no the economy is wonderful
[02:33.000 --> 02:42.000]  everything is good because the federal government says so and this integrates in with this whole
[02:42.000 --> 02:49.920]  casual society control grid the federal government has stated and the OECD at the UN level has stated
[02:49.920 --> 02:58.280]  that basically the finished model is what we're going to live under globally all of your paychecks
[02:58.280 --> 03:06.840]  all of any money you're paid will be put in a government controlled bank account and then
[03:06.840 --> 03:14.040]  whenever the government wants to take money out of your account they can and UK proposes all

[03:47.440 --> 03:54.560]  the larger control grid globalist push one world government transaction tax at UN summit along
[03:54.560 --> 03:59.360]  with the new global digital currency the van core that all of our currencies will be controlled by

[08:29.080 --> 08:33.960]  i'm going to debate him too on man-made global warming we'll have a lively discussion about
[08:33.960 --> 08:40.120]  that because i wasn't fully aware of his views but it's also hard to tell sometimes he gets a bit
[08:40.120 --> 08:48.120]  tongue-in-cheek on his international television program so that is coming up in the third hour
[08:48.120 --> 08:56.360]  today i almost feel like i'm lacking i mean this news and information is so big so off the chart
[08:56.360 --> 09:04.840]  evil so obviously oppressive and authoritarian and hyper corrupt and it's always packaged and
[09:04.840 --> 09:12.040]  sicky sweet and how good it is and there's always lisping politicians and government officials and
[09:12.040 --> 09:19.880]  mpr host with that simpering whispering calm voice uh you know that you uh basically use on a horse
[09:19.880 --> 09:26.120]  you're about to feed into a meat grinder of it's okay honey let me give you the lethal injection
[09:26.120 --> 09:32.360]  we're gonna take good care of you i mean to hear the news going the illegal aliens deserve a chance
[09:32.360 --> 09:38.280]  in america and that's why we've got an amnesty plan to take the millions and millions and millions of
[09:38.280 --> 09:45.160]  children of illegals who came here after they were born and to uh you know give them free tuition
[09:45.160 --> 09:50.680]  and let them join the military well they already joined the military this is going to allow anybody
[09:50.680 --> 09:56.120]  who wants to come across the border and say they're 18 years or younger to become legalized
[09:56.120 --> 10:00.600]  and it's got strings attached for them to be able to bring their families in afterward there's six
[10:00.600 --> 10:07.000]  and a half billion people that want to come here that want to be in the united states
[10:09.160 --> 10:15.880]  and once they get here they're turned into political weapons and vote almost unanimously
[10:15.880 --> 10:23.800]  anti-second amendment pro nafta pro gat pro globalism they're just a internal kept group
[10:23.800 --> 10:31.240]  that is used as a political weapon so we're going to be discussing uh that coming up and and and
[10:31.240 --> 10:37.640]  more asinine lies uh out of the federal government recession officially ended in june of 2009
[10:38.280 --> 10:45.400]  over a year ago what 14 15 months ago it's over the economy is wonderful it it doesn't matter if
[10:45.400 --> 10:51.160]  every major economic indicator shows we're not just in a recession the recession never ended
[10:51.160 --> 10:56.920]  and we're sliding into a textbook depression and we've got all of the government's own
[10:57.960 --> 11:06.280]  uh numbers all of the government's own uh numbers clearly show that we're in a classical
[11:06.280 --> 11:12.360]  depression but hey they'll just tell you like marie antoinette said let them eat cake everything is
[11:12.360 --> 11:18.280]  fine everything is wonderful the federal government's swelling in size the taxes are going up and up
[11:18.280 --> 11:24.920]  so we'll go over that lie as well and and and then here's a report out of salt lake city utah
[11:25.640 --> 11:31.320]  that mirrors the major british government report where they suspended the h1n1 shot
[11:31.320 --> 11:38.440]  for under fives because of a 10 fold increase in violent seizures and other neurological
[11:38.440 --> 11:47.320]  disorders it's in the vaccine inserts it can cause guion marie or narcolepsy or uh epilepsy
[11:47.320 --> 11:53.000]  permanently causing brain inflammation and and and frying your brain where you have violent
[11:53.000 --> 12:00.760]  seizures where here here it is k sl tv h1n1 triggered high rate of seizures and kids well
[12:00.760 --> 12:06.040]  this isn't a side effect this is the effect it should we're all meant to be given an iq reduction
[12:06.040 --> 12:11.640]  the government the un we've all quoted them you know back in the 20s 30s 40s 50s 60s uh the big
[12:11.640 --> 12:17.960]  fabian socialist in england the eugenicist i mean you're all supposed to get a nice iq reduction
[12:17.960 --> 12:23.720]  some people it hits a little harder and so the the lobotomy is is a little rougher and uh
[12:25.480 --> 12:29.720]  it's just meant to reduce fertility some of you get fully sterilized and they don't like that
[12:29.720 --> 12:34.360]  because that makes it a little too obvious they talk about it being a degenerative soft kill
[12:35.080 --> 12:40.200]  they want to slowly hurt you and and and as soon as you wake up to this we can start fixing things
[12:40.200 --> 12:45.160]  but uh here it is new research released sunday by the university of utah shows the h1n1 virus
[12:45.160 --> 12:48.680]  apparently triggered a higher rate of neurological complications and children
[12:49.320 --> 12:55.000]  and of all of the little goodies uh it was a massive increase in uh convulsions now
[12:57.240 --> 13:02.120]  when your child has the convulsion and they and you take your you rush your child in and they got
[13:02.120 --> 13:07.160]  blood coming out their nose in some cases the brain swelling so bad and it causes other swelling
[13:07.160 --> 13:11.880]  in the sinus and and and it causes swelling in organs you name it just the whole body it's like
[13:11.880 --> 13:17.880]  being stung by a couple hundred bees you basically swell up uh doesn't matter if your kid's five
[13:17.880 --> 13:22.280]  doesn't matter if your kid's six months old they're going to try to take them it's not enough
[13:22.280 --> 13:29.400]  they're savagely attacking them it's not enough no no no no they've got an added little bonus
[13:29.400 --> 13:36.040]  goody uh for them where they then say oh we did a CAT scan there's bleeding in your child's brain
[13:36.040 --> 13:40.680]  you threw your kid up against the wall and you're like no i didn't uh but see now they've got a
[13:40.680 --> 13:45.560]  problem so many parents they give them the shot and the kids start having convulsions within minutes
[13:45.560 --> 13:50.600]  and and they'll start saying did you beat your child in the waiting room get me the police right
[13:50.600 --> 13:55.400]  now the cops come the special hospital cops that are just savage and ready to take down any family
[13:55.400 --> 13:59.560]  they can because they get little bonuses and advancements for how many kids they kidnap
[13:59.560 --> 14:04.040]  the parents are like it was the shot it was the shot did that wait the insert says it they're like
[14:04.040 --> 14:08.600]  whoa whoa just get out of here this is a happy hunting ground don't scare the other cattle coming
[14:08.600 --> 14:14.120]  in here back off back off back off i'm not kidding you understand the mega evil we're under
[14:15.960 --> 14:22.840]  oh i'm so sick of the filth by the way if you search the term eco fascism there are literally
[14:22.840 --> 14:29.400]  scores of articles mainstream news new york times christian science monitor london guardian every
[14:29.400 --> 14:36.680]  every single day saying we do need eco fascism everyone agrees just like al gore said the science
[14:36.680 --> 14:42.280]  has settled everyone agrees uh that we have manmade global warming and paying global taxes
[14:42.280 --> 14:48.200]  is the way to fix it it's like you know a indulgence or something to get your family out of purgatory
[14:48.200 --> 14:56.520]  to the catholic church 800 years ago so i mean there's this type of stuff going on and i mean
[14:56.520 --> 15:02.040]  just look at these headlines humans are too stupid to prevent climate change and they go on to say
[15:02.040 --> 15:06.200]  we need to get rid of democracy and have an authoritarian system london guardian here's
[15:06.200 --> 15:12.520]  another one an alternative to the new wave of eco fascism we can so again they limit the debate do
[15:12.520 --> 15:21.160]  you want hardcore reeducation gulags or do you just want to do what we say and let us not allow
[15:21.160 --> 15:25.080]  you to have a single family home germany's already passed that law and you're only allowed to have
[15:25.080 --> 15:32.280]  one child are you going to be reasonable so there's loving fascism and hardcore fascism uh and and so
[15:32.280 --> 15:40.520]  it continues and paul watson has a detailed report out at info wars dot com and prison planet dot com
[15:41.320 --> 15:49.560]  today and the headline is global warming alarmist calls for eco gulags to reeducate climate
[15:49.560 --> 15:55.320]  deniers now we've played greenpeace videos we've quoted prince charles we i mean literally the
[15:55.320 --> 16:02.760]  majority of them say they are going to take your children and they're going to sterilize them they're
[16:02.760 --> 16:07.400]  going to not even let you have one child you're going to live in government dormitories this is
[16:07.400 --> 16:12.760]  now the law no new single family homes are allowed to be built in germany all there's to be retrofitted
[16:12.760 --> 16:19.080]  by 2020 now law 10 years from now okay this is the plan if they can tell you what type of toilet to
[16:19.080 --> 16:23.480]  have what type of light bulbs and do home inspections and what type of farm you can have
[16:24.040 --> 16:27.800]  they can tell you anything and and the stated goal is deindustrialization
[16:28.920 --> 16:34.920]  i played the john p holder and clip yesterday where he said yes we want to deindustrialize we
[16:34.920 --> 16:42.200]  want zero growth we want to quote de-develop the united states this is the policy now the elites
[16:42.200 --> 16:46.040]  will be flying around their private jets and their huge armored compounds in the countryside
[16:46.040 --> 16:51.000]  that's their model you'll be in a giant rat infested compact city where the police can control
[16:51.000 --> 16:56.200]  you force inoculated and just basically slowly euthanized and so you have to understand
[16:57.720 --> 17:04.920]  all of these groups are in unison saying we need tyranny and i wanted to briefly bring
[17:04.920 --> 17:08.920]  paul watson up at the end of this segment and the next she's got to get back to writing he's got
[17:08.920 --> 17:14.280]  another report coming out uk proposes all paychecks go to the state first and this is the model in the
[17:14.280 --> 17:20.600]  us england's the beta test homeland security the irs state you will be sent to the federal
[17:20.600 --> 17:25.400]  penitentiary if you have a garage sale you already hear about million dollar fines for garage sales
[17:25.400 --> 17:30.840]  ap headline you already hear about all that this is look look this is really happening

[24:16.680 --> 24:22.600]  and i know i was ranting last segment because they're openly stating their hellish plan now
[24:22.600 --> 24:27.720]  paul watson's joining us for one segment and i'm getting into the dream act and the economy and all
[24:27.720 --> 24:32.840]  the rest of it but do you understand it's hidden in plain view the vaccines are meant to brain
[24:32.840 --> 24:39.080]  damage you it's hidden in plain view the gmo crops are designed to give you cancer this is on record

[24:46.040 --> 24:52.440]  too big isn't enough we need to realize that it's all of humanity that stands to lose under this new
[24:52.440 --> 24:58.280]  world order system run by psychopathic control freaks watson get into this finished top environmental
[24:58.280 --> 25:05.320]  guru because his statements mirror that of all the other collectivist posing as environmentalist
[25:05.320 --> 25:11.080]  where they openly say we're going to put you in reeducation camps uh i mean it's incredible these
[25:11.080 --> 25:15.800]  people are total authoritarians it's like when i had the zeitgeist guy on a few years ago and he
[25:15.800 --> 25:21.160]  said alex you'll be put in a reeducation center and people are like alex you're wrong you must accept
[25:21.160 --> 25:27.160]  the reeducation camp you're you you're the bad guy you don't want to go to the reeducation camp
[25:27.160 --> 25:33.240]  and they talk about how we're too stupid uh no no we're too smart we know history we're too smart
[25:33.240 --> 25:37.640]  to get down and lick the boots of control freaks that tell us they're saving our planet if we'll
[25:37.640 --> 25:42.280]  just be their slaves or kill ourselves so tell us about this latest article global warming
[25:42.280 --> 25:49.240]  alarmist calls for eco gulags to reeducate climate deniers yeah this is uh a finished
[25:49.960 --> 25:56.280]  environmentalist named pennsy lecola who's now becoming more prominent and with an increasing
[25:56.280 --> 26:05.160]  band of followers and it's not all that are calling him an eco fascist he himself describes
[26:05.160 --> 26:13.160]  his beliefs in his movement as quote eco fascist he openly describes himself as a nazi this is his
[26:13.160 --> 26:19.160]  own quote we will have to learn from history of revolutionary movement the national socialist
[26:19.160 --> 26:25.400]  to finish Stalinist from the many stages of the russian revolution from the methods of the red
[26:25.400 --> 26:32.520]  brigade and forget our narcissistic self so he's saying that we need to learn from the nazis um
[26:32.520 --> 26:38.920]  to do what well what he advocates which is a 90 population reduction which is the official
[26:38.920 --> 26:44.280]  un plan and expanding on that we've got all these other top environmental ministers in
[26:44.280 --> 26:49.240]  england and other countries on record saying carbon rations i mean we've had some of these
[26:49.240 --> 26:54.840]  guests on the show this is their real plan they're just being honest and they're now running tv ads
[26:54.840 --> 27:02.840]  saying we're coming after you no more mr nice guy i mean these are these people are pure evil well
[27:02.840 --> 27:08.360]  when you peel back the mask of environmentalism you always come face to face with eugenics and
[27:08.360 --> 27:16.120]  mass death every single time and this pennsy lecola his philosophy matches almost precisely with john
[27:16.120 --> 27:22.440]  p holder who is now in the white house running the geoengineering projects which are focused around
[27:22.440 --> 27:29.000]  injecting our atmosphere with deadly cells of particles which um a byproduct just coincide
[27:29.000 --> 27:36.520]  for instance um reduces the power of the immune system to fight disease and aluminum dioxide
[27:36.520 --> 27:44.120]  now infesting the fields exactly so what else is this guy calling for oh their complete psychopath
[27:44.120 --> 27:49.800]  dr evils and the thumb sucking public isn't going to get it so enjoy the cancer enjoy the death
[27:49.800 --> 27:55.800]  enjoy it you want it you're going to get it don't worry he says birth giving must be licensed
[27:55.800 --> 28:01.560]  energy production and use must be drastically reduced that humans should be forced to eat
[28:01.560 --> 28:07.480]  rats that people should be barred by law from traveling and that only the elite should be
[28:07.480 --> 28:12.680]  allowed to travel that's everything being proposed under the carbon taxes that means that you've
[28:12.680 --> 28:19.160]  had the british government say only essential travel should be legal right and he says that
[28:20.040 --> 28:28.120]  fifties big fifties should be attacked by some transnational body like the un with nuclear weapons
[28:28.120 --> 28:33.240]  or with back ideological and chemical now that's barter and russell he said wipe out the major
[28:33.240 --> 28:39.800]  cities to redesign the planet nobel prize winner same thing ht well so and and and look all their
[28:39.800 --> 28:44.360]  writings as soon as the grids in place they're going to release bio weapons and kill us and the
[28:44.360 --> 28:48.360]  and the cops are listening laughing and because they will not look at the documents they want to
[28:48.360 --> 28:53.800]  serve the government oh they love the petty power trip paul how do we warn the public about these
[28:53.800 --> 28:58.520]  people how how do we let them i know this sounds crazy because they are crazy we're not the crazy
[28:58.520 --> 29:05.000]  ones we're the normal people who are upset by these psychopathic demons yes and yeah the
[29:05.000 --> 29:11.240]  establishment point fingers at all for encouraging violence when this individual directly and
[29:11.240 --> 29:18.920]  explicitly calls for violence to uh further his warped mindset of mass population reduction
[29:18.920 --> 29:24.520]  we had the case a couple of weeks ago of james j lee hold on let me stop you paul i know you've

[32:11.960 --> 32:17.320]  electric company allows you to have it's true total government control of electricity in the name
[32:17.320 --> 32:22.600]  of smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[32:22.600 --> 32:27.800]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem
[32:27.800 --> 32:33.000]  number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families

[33:15.160 --> 33:21.640]  how frustrating it is to know the un wants 80 to 90 percent of us dead and that's the liberal view
[33:21.640 --> 33:26.680]  many say all humans must be killed and that this is what's taught at the university's globally
[33:26.680 --> 33:32.120]  this is what they're setting up all of your paychecks will be wired into the government first
[33:32.120 --> 33:37.480]  you'll have weekly home inspections you'll have to pay huge taxes to be able to have one child

[33:43.160 --> 33:48.840]  because we don't have any people and left and that's not enough they say everyone must die humans
[33:48.840 --> 33:55.000]  are evil and they say release bio weapons on our cities and this is the main line view and they
[33:55.000 --> 34:00.840]  openly say once their planetary police state that's a quote they all say it that once it's in place
[34:00.840 --> 34:05.080]  they're going to just start openly murdering everybody and and see you think this is funny
[34:05.080 --> 34:09.880]  dr eric pionka at ut what four years ago made headlines when we pointed out that he got a
[34:09.880 --> 34:14.520]  standing ovation at the texas academy of science is saying he can't wait for 90 percent of us to
[34:14.520 --> 34:19.240]  be killed by the release of an airborne abola the fbi even visited him after we warned folks
[34:19.960 --> 34:23.640]  that's a normal response when somebody and then his graduate students were sending me
[34:23.640 --> 34:27.640]  threatening emails and i would search their name and it'd be them in white lab coats working at
[34:27.640 --> 34:32.600]  government bio weapon labs and i'm getting emails from him saying we're going to get rid of all
[34:32.600 --> 34:37.400]  humans and then you look them up and they work in bio weapons labs oh who do you think works at
[34:37.400 --> 34:45.560]  bio weapons labs oh yes oh they're gonna they're gonna really have fun aren't they mm-hmm you think
[34:45.560 --> 34:52.680]  13 monkeys or 12 monkeys whatever the movie is with uh bruce willis what is that 13 monkeys 12
[34:52.680 --> 34:59.240]  monkey 12 monkeys after you know where the bio weapon lab releases these the the bio weapon
[34:59.240 --> 35:05.000]  that kills almost everybody all right i'm ranting i want to get into the economy the dream act and
[35:05.000 --> 35:10.600]  how all this ties together with globalism and i want to get into uk proposes all paychecks go to
[35:10.600 --> 35:15.240]  the state first and they propose going up on vat and they did it and the conservative government
[35:15.240 --> 35:20.200]  supports it and people go i mean it's just it's unlimited what they're gonna do the the goal
[35:20.200 --> 35:25.960]  is to bankrupt you but before we go any further we we couldn't do this radio show i couldn't be
[35:25.960 --> 35:30.920]  here every day if it wasn't for our sponsors and our listeners and our prison planet dot tv members
[35:30.920 --> 35:35.960]  and folks that buy the books the t-shirts the materials we couldn't do it without you uh and

[36:08.040 --> 36:13.720]  globally because of you and it's time to accelerate exposing these people we don't pull punches when
[36:13.720 --> 36:18.440]  they openly say they want a planetary regime to kill us and we see them setting it up you better
[36:18.440 --> 36:23.160]  believe we come out and we don't miss words when the imf says they're setting up a world global
[36:23.160 --> 36:28.840]  tax to shut down our economy we come out and read it we're not intimidated by the media
[36:28.840 --> 36:34.040]  calling us cooks we read what these murdering scums say they want to intimidate you and tell

[38:17.720 --> 38:22.600]  alarmist calls for eco gulags to reeducate climate deniers start from the beginning what this guy's
[38:22.600 --> 38:26.920]  calling for and finish up your points because then you're gonna post the article uk proposes all
[38:26.920 --> 38:32.520]  paychecks go to the state first hit them hard watch and tell us about this slime bag you know if
[38:32.520 --> 38:37.000]  if there's too many people he needs to go jump off a cliff instead of calling for us to be killed
[38:37.000 --> 38:45.080]  and calling for us to have bio weapons used on us Watson he advocates another world war he says
[38:45.080 --> 38:50.920]  that another world war would be a quote a happy occasion for the planet he says any dictatorship
[38:50.920 --> 38:55.880]  would be better than modern democracy and that state department of a random 200 all he's stating
[38:55.880 --> 39:01.400]  is what's in all the government plans go ahead he advocates killing defectives he advocates the
[39:01.400 --> 39:08.280]  centralized government begs the tireless control over the system and now to denial with this some
[39:08.280 --> 39:14.520]  people i like still don't get it they think that oh it's just some obscure Finnish ecologist this
[39:14.520 --> 39:20.680]  is a dominant belief system amongst environmentally you have the power in john holger and the white
[39:20.680 --> 39:27.560]  house science star running the uh geo engineering program his 1977 book eco science embraces the
[39:27.560 --> 39:34.760]  same ideals as i can say and he repeated all of that in 1998 yeah and then you've got the money
[39:34.760 --> 39:40.680]  bill gate ten billion dollars a year funding vaccines to the third world the prime purpose
[39:40.680 --> 39:46.840]  behind which is to reduce global population as gate said and he don't work and he don't head
[39:46.840 --> 39:53.480]  speech you know how can vaccines aimed at um curing health problems you know lower global
[39:53.480 --> 40:00.200]  population unless they're sterilizing people in the third world the depravity of what this guy
[40:00.200 --> 40:07.560]  advocates is just unimaginable no he is a would be killer who is part of the cult and he is an
[40:07.560 --> 40:13.080]  enemy of every one of us he wants us dead he has stated it and everything he's saying is official
[40:13.080 --> 40:21.000]  imf world bank club of rome un ran corporation council on foreign relations all of these people
[40:21.000 --> 40:26.920]  are vicious pigs who want the life extension technologies for themselves and want us out of
[40:26.920 --> 40:32.600]  the way and so at least down the road if they do release the bio weapons and poses our saviors
[40:32.600 --> 40:37.480]  and organize the collapse remember they did it and at least some of you can hide out and form a
[40:37.480 --> 40:42.760]  resistance then a lot of you are denying now you won't later when you're burying your dead kids go
[40:42.760 --> 40:51.000]  ahead but this guy makes hitler and starlin look like fair-minded humanitarian i mean he said who
[40:51.000 --> 40:57.000]  misses all those who died in the second world war who misses the 20 million executed by starlin who
[40:57.000 --> 41:03.240]  misses hitler six million jews you know he's not couching it behind some liberal environmentalism
[41:03.240 --> 41:09.080]  he's openly saying look i'm a nazi i'm a mass murder advocating nazi i want to kill 90 percent of
[41:09.080 --> 41:15.640]  you and he is a and he's the hot hollywood star of the sicko greenpeace people and the rest of them
[41:15.640 --> 41:19.800]  this is how they all talk i mean i was reading all these other headlines calling for basically the
[41:19.800 --> 41:26.520]  same stuff here's the deal though we have really razz them by exposing their fraud and that's why
[41:26.520 --> 41:31.560]  they say they're going public and that they want to start getting violent against us and so folks
[41:31.560 --> 41:40.040]  all we can do is defend ourselves against these oh blotzen go ahead just go ahead yeah i mean
[41:40.760 --> 41:46.360]  key varnish another top environmentalist he wrote a book recently calling for active sabotage
[41:46.360 --> 41:52.520]  and environmental terrorism you know blowing up dams demolishing cities to return the planet to an
[41:52.520 --> 42:00.600]  agrarian age his book was endorsed by nasa's dr james hampton and again this finished ecologist
[42:00.600 --> 42:07.640]  quote everything we have developed over the last 100 years should be destroyed i mean
[42:07.640 --> 42:14.440]  charles manson didn't even go as far as this guy manson is now similar to this finish oh he's now
[42:14.440 --> 42:21.000]  worshiped by them in mainstream news he said 30 years ago global warming cult killed 90 percent
[42:21.000 --> 42:27.080]  he wrote songs for the beach boys he was one of their gurus but he still is alex he's good he's
[42:27.080 --> 42:32.840]  now charles manson now has a following of environmentalists who preach his message that
[42:32.840 --> 42:39.800]  we need to kill 50 million humans so in comparison i guess this um this uh finish ecologist is you
[42:39.800 --> 42:46.040]  know the truth is their little spoiled brat control freaks and after all the money the power of the
[42:46.040 --> 42:52.760]  drugs they don't enjoy sunsets or beauty or wholesomeness they get off as o brian tells winston
[42:52.760 --> 42:59.640]  smith in 1984 on raw orgies of death well i got news for you chicken neck scum you're not going to
[42:59.640 --> 43:05.320]  get us you're not going to get us you think you got us and now you're coming out bearing your your
[43:05.320 --> 43:10.120]  your spider things at us and humanity is going to rise against you scumbag
[43:11.720 --> 43:17.400]  and listen to this quote the minority can never have any other effective means to influence the
[43:17.400 --> 43:24.520]  force of matters thought through the use of violence so he's calling for violence in further
[43:24.520 --> 43:29.480]  of these extremist and that's why they stage to start over on that but that's why they stage
[43:29.480 --> 43:35.720]  terror attacks the globalists to preemptively say patriots have done it to neutralize us politically
[43:35.720 --> 43:41.800]  so they can carry out their violence against us go ahead exactly and now we're having
[43:41.800 --> 43:47.400]  seeing adherence to this environmentally cool go out and try to commit violence to further their
[43:47.400 --> 43:52.360]  beliefs no they shoot their babies in the chest of the media says it's good you know you line your
[43:52.360 --> 43:58.440]  toddler up shoot him with a 45 and the media's oh that's really good oh yeah but you don't see the
[43:58.440 --> 44:04.680]  Rockefellers or bill gates shooting their children in the chest do you paul well exactly but one of
[44:04.680 --> 44:10.600]  the main denial aspect of this is the fact that people say well there are too many people on the
[44:10.600 --> 44:17.160]  planet we need to reduce global population now if you accept that as a fact then that opens the door
[44:17.160 --> 44:24.840]  to all kinds of porous the fact is overpopulation is a complete myth the un zone statistics say
[44:24.840 --> 44:31.880]  that by 2020 the population will level out by 2050 it will rapidly start to decline well i mean
[44:31.880 --> 44:40.280]  calling pal was on tv yesterday saying we've only got 1.3 children for every two people we're dying
[44:40.280 --> 44:44.840]  we've got to bring in unlimited legal aliens they've they've destroyed the west and they love it
[44:44.840 --> 44:52.280]  they love to facing anything great exactly i mean russia's government begs this population to have
[44:52.280 --> 44:58.520]  babies because they're dying out by 2050 population is going to plummet we're going to have a depopulation
[44:58.520 --> 45:04.760]  crisis and uh and all is not well the chinese government came out and said they may get rid
[45:04.760 --> 45:09.720]  of the one child policy even if the u.s threatens to pull funding our government funded it on record
[45:09.720 --> 45:15.400]  because they don't have enough people to pay for the old people because they're 1.7 we're 1.3
[45:16.840 --> 45:23.080]  yeah so i'm tired i'm tired of seeing these coins oh co2 is a problem overpopulation is a problem
[45:23.080 --> 45:29.800]  it's not go and look at the un zone figures 2050 population gets to nine billion it rapidly
[45:29.800 --> 45:36.760]  declines after that this is an excuse used by tyrants for the justification for complete control
[45:36.760 --> 45:44.600]  over every aspect right they are blood thirsty bedwetting chicken necks who never lived never
[45:44.600 --> 45:50.040]  gotten a fistfight never climbed a mountain never went through any stress they are i've seen them
[45:50.040 --> 45:54.840]  they're all of and effeminates the wrong word is that puts down women they are these weak
[45:55.640 --> 46:02.280]  serpent like bags of maggot vomit i'm sorry folks that's what they are they are pit demons directly
[46:02.280 --> 46:09.400]  from hades who love death and i'm telling them i'm telling them i'm telling them that we are
[46:09.400 --> 46:15.080]  going to defeat them they are not going to stop the human spirit in our species our species is
[46:15.080 --> 46:21.720]  beautiful it is wondrous are the human mind created equations that can create atomic energy and
[46:21.720 --> 46:27.800]  weapons and fold space systems and dimensional understanding that supercomputers are just now
[46:27.800 --> 46:35.080]  confirming you hate humanity because you are weak ugly scum and you hate the beauty and you will
[46:35.080 --> 46:44.120]  fail you will fail you will fail you will fail watch and finish up well the amazing thing is that
[46:44.120 --> 46:49.480]  you know if we allow third world countries to develop and become prosperous then their populations
[46:49.480 --> 46:56.600]  naturally stabilize if we follow the insane policies of this elite and return to an agrarian age
[46:56.600 --> 47:01.800]  then the population will explode so their very solutions will only make the problem
[47:01.800 --> 47:09.400]  10 times 100 times worse which shows the inherent bias which is that they care not they're inherently
[47:09.400 --> 47:15.320]  scum they're inherently wicked little control freaks that like to roll around in buckets of blood
[47:16.360 --> 47:19.880]  and i say they shouldn't roll around in our blood and they love blood so much
[47:19.880 --> 47:24.200]  then they should roll around on their own and get off our planet they're the people we won't
[47:24.200 --> 47:29.960]  miss are these are these parasites look it shows the psychology of how pimps hate their whores
[47:29.960 --> 47:36.040]  abusers hate the people they're abusing they distest who they suck off of well i'd attest you
[47:36.040 --> 47:45.080]  go ahead yeah this this guy openly says he's an athlete openly says that his enemy his philosophical
[47:45.080 --> 47:51.960]  enemy is growth and freedom and his worship is one of the top top environmentalist academics
[47:51.960 --> 47:57.480]  i mean it's astounding he talks about he'd be happy to kill himself if it means that it took
[47:57.480 --> 48:01.480]  a hundred million humans with him oh yeah that's what that that's what peonka says
[48:02.760 --> 48:08.200]  yeah he wants the creation of a green police who would abandon quote the syrups of ethics that
[48:08.200 --> 48:13.400]  govern human behavior so that would allow them to completely dominate the population an army
[48:13.400 --> 48:21.240]  of psychopathic jackboots exactly and now what do we have with all the new green fascism measures
[48:21.240 --> 48:27.960]  being introduced exactly that that's the dog well watson you've done an incredible job the report
[48:27.960 --> 48:31.720]  that we've got to get out to everyone global warming alarmist calls for eco gulags reeducate
[48:31.720 --> 48:37.320]  climate deniers this is the real policy the real plan and you better get your blood up and your
[48:37.320 --> 48:42.040]  guts up you better get serious folks and start caring about real issues watson great job
[48:44.600 --> 48:48.360]  i want to bring ted anderson up briefly here and then come back and get into more on the economy
[48:48.360 --> 48:52.520]  and a bunch of other news because gold is up another five dollars and seventy plus cents today
[48:53.240 --> 48:57.880]  and uh he is the owner of this network and has the best deals on gold and silver
[48:57.880 --> 49:01.960]  is ted in studio right here with the alex tell me we're about to go to break i know you got to
[49:01.960 --> 49:07.080]  go to a meeting here in a minute but thanks for letting me drag you on i just wanted you to i mean
[49:07.080 --> 49:11.080]  they're admitting in the news that gold's going up because they're engaged in quantitative easing
[49:11.080 --> 49:16.600]  that is printing money uh did you run out of last week's offer what do you got today well it's funny
[49:16.600 --> 49:20.760]  i had my tooth filled this morning so i didn't have time to change prices and check inventory so
[49:20.760 --> 49:26.520]  i'm just holding the same specials i did last friday despite the fact that silver is uh just
[49:26.520 --> 49:32.520]  three cents away from twenty one dollars an ounce and gold is less than sixteen dollars now from
[49:32.520 --> 49:38.280]  thirteen hundred uh we do have the uh walking liberty half still at that nine dollars and ninety
[49:38.280 --> 49:43.480]  five cents actually they've gone up in price i just haven't had a chance to catch up with it so i'll
[49:43.480 --> 49:47.640]  be doing that later today we'll hold this special throughout the end of the day just because i'm
[49:47.640 --> 49:52.680]  here i'm doing it on air but uh the francs are still at two seventy five obviously they've shot
[49:52.680 --> 49:58.280]  up in price british sovereigns three fifty one uh even if you want the older twenty dollar liberties
[49:58.280 --> 50:02.600]  they're still at sixteen twenty two twenty ten dollar liberties or eight twenty nine there's a
[50:02.600 --> 50:06.280]  whole long array of different things that are you know going to be increasing in price i haven't
[50:06.280 --> 50:10.920]  had a chance to do it for these specials yet but we'll be getting that taken care of prices will
[50:10.920 --> 50:16.440]  be up you know fairly substantial by tomorrow so if you want to get involved in the precious metals
[50:16.440 --> 50:22.760]  now is the time to do it i mean absolutely uh elix i you know watching gold and silver i really
[50:22.760 --> 50:27.000]  now have the total belief that we're going to blow through thirteen hundred dollars an ounce
[50:27.000 --> 50:32.600]  and that's going to seem so uh low and inexpensive it's not even funny let me fire out the number
[50:32.600 --> 50:36.200]  because you were unable to get rid of the last special of gold and silver you bought a month
[50:36.200 --> 50:41.000]  to go at a lower price passing that savings on you can't find a better deal anywhere folks eight hundred

[55:10.200 --> 55:16.120]  paychecks go to the state first same things getting set up in the us where your paycheck goes to
[55:16.120 --> 55:21.000]  the government this is the finished model now i'm ranting but uh ted to explain to people
[55:21.560 --> 55:27.320]  this golden silver you were going to change the special today it's still there the radio special
[55:27.320 --> 55:35.640]  explain to people if these silver half dollars are below ten dollars apiece and they're selling
[55:35.640 --> 55:41.560]  for 15 16 dollars everywhere i mean these are deals nobody can surpass well i mean obviously
[55:41.560 --> 55:45.480]  the real world everything's gone up more than a dollar on these coins here because silver's
[55:45.480 --> 55:50.840]  gone up about four dollars here recently so yeah it's just been a hot market you're going to start
[55:50.840 --> 55:55.560]  hearing about shortages again because i'm already hearing it from my wholesalers out there in the
[55:55.560 --> 56:00.040]  marketplace so if you want to get involved with gold and silver and you want to do it at low
[56:00.040 --> 56:05.400]  premiums and not pay ridiculous prices over spot now is the time to get involved with them and those
[56:05.400 --> 56:12.280]  walking liberty halves at nine nine nine ninety five should be trading more like 1250 and so you
[56:12.280 --> 56:17.080]  know realistically speaking if you want to get in i mean now is the time to do it i mean the frank
[56:17.080 --> 56:23.080]  275 i buy a forecaster for a full year you're talking about the fed easing credit again and that's
[56:23.080 --> 56:27.720]  why gold is going up if you want to know what's going on we have a free document it's right from
[56:27.720 --> 56:32.520]  our own government it's called the federal debt debt and risk of financial crises we'll send it to
[56:32.520 --> 56:37.640]  you it explains why the united states government is in such trouble the pentagon put out a report
[56:37.640 --> 56:42.440]  last week saying they believe we may completely collapse and and there may be total revolution
[56:42.440 --> 56:47.320]  because they've engineered it meanwhile the feds are saying the recession ended over a year ago
[56:47.320 --> 56:51.960]  i know well that's obviously a bunch of crap and people need to get moving and they need to protect
[56:51.960 --> 56:57.720]  themselves and again the only thing i can say is you know take the time to read this document
[56:57.720 --> 57:02.440]  get the information ask for the cbo report do me a favor and say baloney where it's a family

[01:02:39.560 --> 01:02:47.000]  of banning barter of banning local sales of banning garage sales of controlling every facet of our
[01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:53.480]  lives and this is the total control grid and it ties into the eugenics the environmental slave
[01:02:53.480 --> 01:02:59.000]  system that the neo feudalism the modern slavery the modern serfdoms we got a detailed report that
[01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:05.560]  boils all of this down i'm going to be getting to that as well uh plus they're pulling everything
[01:03:06.680 --> 01:03:12.520]  out to go after christine o donald and i'm not saying she's perfect i said last week i don't
[01:03:12.520 --> 01:03:17.320]  know her from adam but when you've got carl rove coming out against her for taking 20 years to
[01:03:17.320 --> 01:03:23.720]  pay back her student loans and calling it dishonest and evil uh when large portions of the congress
[01:03:23.720 --> 01:03:28.280]  and the last two white houses don't even pay taxes and you've got the republican machine
[01:03:28.280 --> 01:03:31.480]  against her along with the democrats you know something's going on well it turns out over
[01:03:31.480 --> 01:03:38.120]  a decade ago she was in a talk so that she dabbled in witchcraft in high school well i mean for 30
[01:03:38.120 --> 01:03:43.480]  years half the shows on tv are about girls being witches and magic charms and you go to the store
[01:03:43.480 --> 01:03:49.160]  and in the in the in in the girls section and it's got to be half of it is about that i mean
[01:03:49.160 --> 01:03:56.280]  the tv shows the cartoons the point is she's a christian now um so now we have modern witch

[01:08:18.360 --> 01:08:26.440]  of news ahead of max geyser and t-minus 52 minutes but i wanted to talk about some of the political
[01:08:26.440 --> 01:08:33.080]  races coming up the mainstream media is getting more and more discredited uh in national polls
[01:08:33.080 --> 01:08:39.880]  about 22 still trust the mainstream media it's about 24 trust the government in any way depending
[01:08:39.880 --> 01:08:44.920]  on what poll you look at it's right around that low 20s and you see those numbers all the time
[01:08:44.920 --> 01:08:51.800]  and you can look it up for yourself you want to pull it up but but at the greatest time in modern
[01:08:51.800 --> 01:08:57.640]  us history at the greatest numbers people do not trust the mainstream media in the government
[01:08:57.640 --> 01:09:02.120]  and it's because people have learned their tricks and they may not know all the subtle details
[01:09:02.120 --> 01:09:06.680]  but they know overall they're being bamboozled they're being scammed that there's a tyrannical
[01:09:06.680 --> 01:09:12.680]  oppressive out of control bloodsucking parasitical agenda going on but i've been here in the last
[01:09:12.680 --> 01:09:17.880]  six months oh the g.o.p. is going to get tied to the tea parties and that's going to bring them down
[01:09:17.880 --> 01:09:24.120]  the g.o.p. is going to lose the g.o.p. is not going to win any seats uh because the tea parties are
[01:09:24.120 --> 01:09:31.640]  so radical and i even see carl rove saying that and i even see neo cons on fox putting out this
[01:09:31.640 --> 01:09:36.440]  talking point because the old line republican party is threatened by this and they can't do
[01:09:36.440 --> 01:09:43.400]  what they did in 94 and put a person like newt genrich uh mr global carbon taxes mr new world
[01:09:43.400 --> 01:09:48.280]  order in they're not going to be able to get away with that bainer is not perfect but he is certainly
[01:09:49.160 --> 01:09:53.720]  no newt genrich mr new world order so they're going after bainer saying he's an elitist because he
[01:09:53.720 --> 01:09:59.080]  plays golf when it came from a family of what was it eight kids and and was it was a janitor
[01:09:59.080 --> 01:10:05.880]  putting his way through college the issue here is that in almost every race and i've got the
[01:10:05.880 --> 01:10:11.480]  spreadsheets you can pull these up i even heard lembaugh talking about it friday the point is
[01:10:11.480 --> 01:10:18.040]  democrats who are anti-government run health care anti-obama they're the only one still
[01:10:18.040 --> 01:10:24.680]  winning in the primaries and establishment democrats uh are losing in the primaries like
[01:10:24.680 --> 01:10:30.520]  specter and you know the laundry list out there and it's the same thing for republicans whether
[01:10:30.520 --> 01:10:40.120]  it's delaware or kentucky or utah or oklahoma uh or uh places uh like colorada it doesn't matter
[01:10:40.120 --> 01:10:44.920]  the establishment is in deep trouble and they know it so the republican leadership a democratic
[01:10:44.920 --> 01:10:48.520]  leadership are teamed up right now on the rhetoric and they're creating this self-fulfilling
[01:10:48.520 --> 01:10:55.080]  prophecy oh the tea parties are evil oh the tea parties can't win and the new york times came out
[01:10:55.080 --> 01:11:01.240]  sunday and said the white house plans to target tea parties and they're going to tie the republicans
[01:11:01.240 --> 01:11:04.920]  to it and try to defeat them the white house demanded they retract the article they've now
[01:11:04.920 --> 01:11:11.560]  changed it because they know that's a losing strategy so the good news here is we've never had
[01:11:11.560 --> 01:11:17.480]  a political realignment as big as it is right now since the beginning of this country and there's
[01:11:17.480 --> 01:11:22.040]  no spinning it there's no getting rid of it there's no just making the tea parties republicanoid
[01:11:22.680 --> 01:11:30.040]  rhino it's not gonna work okay people know people know world governments real they know
[01:11:30.040 --> 01:11:35.240]  that the un is corrupt they know these wars are a fraud they know homeland securities for the
[01:11:35.240 --> 01:11:40.600]  american people they know they know there's no putting the genie back in the bottle the globalist
[01:11:40.600 --> 01:11:45.720]  can do whatever they want they're in deep trouble they cannot reverse this minus massive stage terror
[01:11:45.720 --> 01:11:50.760]  attacks and we've been exposing that and so we're taking that to a lot of their arsenal okay let's
[01:11:50.760 --> 01:11:58.120]  go to your phone calls the toll-free number is 800 259 92 31 dave in florida you're on the air thanks
[01:11:58.120 --> 01:12:04.840]  for holding hey thanks alexa i got two things real quick uh you couldn't have set me up better
[01:12:04.840 --> 01:12:12.600]  um there was a vaccination video that came out on today's show uh it's called uh vaccinations 101
[01:12:12.600 --> 01:12:18.840]  and of course they got my attention because it was an orwellian thing going with the room 101
[01:12:19.480 --> 01:12:25.880]  okay and that's what there's a real witch out there and they use neurolinguistic programming
[01:12:25.880 --> 01:12:30.920]  and these things that's supposed to look like calling like people are actually calling into
[01:12:30.920 --> 01:12:37.000]  the show they're not you're all set up contrived questions and this particular video is so obvious
[01:12:37.720 --> 01:12:42.520]  but what they're doing is setting things up and the more i looked at the more i was able to
[01:12:42.520 --> 01:12:50.280]  decrypt their hand signals and their words and their numbers no no they're a gang it's all gang
[01:12:50.280 --> 01:12:56.120]  slide uh you know gang sign it's like east side vato you know down with it but it's the globalist
[01:12:56.120 --> 01:13:01.640]  skull and bones gang sign excellent yes and she she she even makes reference obviously with the
[01:13:01.640 --> 01:13:07.320]  title 101 but she puts her hands up to her face one in the video just like in the room 101 in the
[01:13:07.320 --> 01:13:12.200]  movie where the two rats are in front of the face and she's talking about when uh this person goes
[01:13:12.200 --> 01:13:16.760]  to college how the germers will be in her face and she needs protection and she puts up the
[01:13:16.760 --> 01:13:23.080]  peace sign with her left hand that's a va that's a six that's like everything she is saying is
[01:13:23.080 --> 01:13:28.200]  garbage and it's it's it's a signal to each other and it's a signal that they're insiders
[01:13:28.760 --> 01:13:36.600]  and i've decrypted the whole thing it's even and i'm now there's even triple six things that they
[01:13:36.600 --> 01:13:42.920]  put in these things no david i hear you listen they had famous democratic debates
[01:13:44.680 --> 01:13:50.120]  in 96 where they projected a devil and upside down stars i mean all of this means something
[01:13:50.120 --> 01:13:55.640]  to these people uh let's go ahead and take another call but but you know speaking of vaccines
[01:13:55.640 --> 01:14:05.080]  here's ksl tv out of salt lake city utah and it says last year's pandemic influenza made a lot of
[01:14:05.080 --> 01:14:10.680]  people sick but many kids got really sick new research released sunday by the university of
[01:14:10.680 --> 01:14:15.880]  utah shows h1n1 virus apparently triggered a high rate of neurological complications in children
[01:14:15.880 --> 01:14:24.200]  including convulsions including convulsions now what did britain have to admit suspending shots
[01:14:24.200 --> 01:14:31.080]  for under fives a tenfold increase in convulsions and other neurological disorders they're designed
[01:14:31.080 --> 01:14:36.600]  to do it but they're just brazenly out on the air saying mercury is good for your children
[01:14:36.600 --> 01:14:41.800]  they're brazenly out saying lead and shiny's toys is good melamine isn't bad for children
[01:14:41.800 --> 01:14:47.160]  even though it makes their kidneys fail you know we're taking the dead troops insurance money it's
[01:14:47.160 --> 01:14:54.120]  good uh you know core exits good for you asbestos is good for you they're just they're just throwing
[01:14:54.120 --> 01:15:01.640]  it all in your face lisa in new york you're on the air hi alex um i've been uh investing in
[01:15:01.640 --> 01:15:07.480]  silver for a while but it isn't sort of the silver coinage it's the sort of thing that
[01:15:07.480 --> 01:15:13.000]  your grandmother would hand down to you like silver cutlery and candlesticks is that something
[01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:18.760]  that's okay to continue or is it oh i mean it's only quadrupled in value in the last eight years
[01:15:18.760 --> 01:15:24.120]  i mean it was on average calculated into the cost about five dollars an ounce then they would add
[01:15:24.680 --> 01:15:30.600]  the craftsmanship cost and uh you know was it a collector's item and so that would increase the
[01:15:30.600 --> 01:15:36.040]  value depending on the piece but uh sure your your your silver cutlery is of valued roughly four
[01:15:36.040 --> 01:15:41.160]  times what it was eight years ago so i mean was that a good investment for you of course it was
[01:15:42.040 --> 01:15:47.720]  i hope so uh if things get really really hard would it would it be something that'd be easy to
[01:15:47.720 --> 01:15:53.960]  get rid of well here's the problem it's not as good as silver coins because those are a
[01:15:53.960 --> 01:15:58.440]  mode of exchange there's a bigger market for them and because we're in a depressed economy
[01:15:58.440 --> 01:16:04.120]  you might not get four times uh what what you originally bought for it if it was eight years
[01:16:04.120 --> 01:16:07.960]  ago or before just because people don't have the money to buy it but you're probably gonna get a
[01:16:07.960 --> 01:16:13.560]  lot more than what you originally paid so yes i mean real tangible i mean what what do governments
[01:16:13.560 --> 01:16:18.760]  have what do elites have when they were chasing down the nazis what they have diamonds gold silver
[01:16:18.760 --> 01:16:27.960]  art uh you know uh expensive silver and gold cutlery that's called booty valuables uh and
[01:16:29.160 --> 01:16:33.160]  that's what's really got value that's what the globalists obsess on because it's real
[01:16:34.440 --> 01:16:38.840]  all right well thank you very much mr child thank you i appreciate your call yes excellent
[01:16:38.840 --> 01:16:47.160]  investment if you did it eight years ago uh let's go ahead and talk to um ha who's up next
[01:16:48.840 --> 01:16:57.320]  okay uh alex in california hi alex hey buddy thanks for taking my call i'm a first time caller
[01:16:57.320 --> 01:17:02.120]  long time listener and uh i wanted to talk a little bit about the airport body scanners
[01:17:02.120 --> 01:17:11.800]  uh i want to remind people that uh they have an option they have a choice they have to say i opt
[01:17:11.800 --> 01:17:17.560]  out because you are not required by law to submit to uh the body scan of the airport
[01:17:17.560 --> 01:17:25.640]  at apparently the gsa workers are trained to give you a pat down if you just say i opt out so they
[01:17:25.640 --> 01:17:31.960]  were trying to force you to take the naked body scan yeah and i did no pressure you to uh
[01:17:31.960 --> 01:17:37.400]  into uh well let me stop you let me stop you they admit it gives 20 to 50 times the radiation of
[01:17:37.400 --> 01:17:42.280]  what they'd previously said they admit they're storing the naked images and they lied and the
[01:17:42.280 --> 01:17:47.640]  what four months ago in the chicago tribune the head of the tsa said we do plan to make this
[01:17:47.640 --> 01:17:53.880]  mandatory and the first place they admitted it was two months ago in el paso texas everyone
[01:17:53.880 --> 01:18:00.360]  is forced through el paso times you must say no so they tried to force you through the naked
[01:18:00.360 --> 01:18:07.880]  body scanner at at at what airport well i haven't uh they they actually have uh basically in chicago
[01:18:07.880 --> 01:18:14.520]  or here but uh you have to say all you gotta say is i opt out and apparently this is a word that
[01:18:14.520 --> 01:18:20.120]  they've been instructed to uh just go ahead and give you the pat down and they won't uh
[01:18:20.120 --> 01:18:24.600]  you know bother you in the force to go through the body scanner but was i misunderstanding
[01:18:24.600 --> 01:18:28.760]  because i got from what you were saying your phone's a bit muffled that they tried to still
[01:18:28.760 --> 01:18:32.520]  talk you into it like we don't have somebody trained for a pat down go through this
[01:18:33.640 --> 01:18:40.040]  uh i actually i didn't understand me uh but um they you know if you say if you if you are about
[01:18:40.040 --> 01:18:47.480]  to go through the uh the you know in the security line and uh and you say uh i opt out they will
[01:18:47.480 --> 01:18:52.840]  be forced to give to give you a pat down instead of making you go through the buster yes sir but
[01:18:52.840 --> 01:18:58.600]  they're trying to phase that out so more of us need to say no and they're under such pressure
[01:18:58.600 --> 01:19:01.880]  over these that now they're claiming they're going to add a computer program to it that
[01:19:01.880 --> 01:19:06.600]  puts a cartoon image over you so they don't see your naked body but that's a lie as well
[01:19:06.600 --> 01:19:12.040]  they are saving the images and they're going in mobile vans i mean think about the magnitude of
[01:19:12.040 --> 01:19:18.840]  this forbs admits 500 vans were purchased we're now confirming they're roving all over the country
[01:19:18.840 --> 01:19:24.040]  they drive by they stop at each house and look right through your walls not just violating your
[01:19:24.040 --> 01:19:29.880]  fourth amendment but bathing you in super high powered radiation i mean can you believe that
[01:19:29.880 --> 01:19:37.640]  i mean this is beyond 1984 yeah it's pretty amazing uh i just want to remind people just say i opt
[01:19:37.640 --> 01:19:44.280]  out and uh we were overwhelmed there's the system god bless you god bless you alex well said the

[01:24:07.400 --> 01:24:16.520]  welcome hey alec hey buddy thanks for taking my call i want to tell you uh my awakening happened
[01:24:16.520 --> 01:24:24.120]  about two years ago when i started listening to your shelf and i started doing my own research
[01:24:24.840 --> 01:24:32.440]  and i found a lot of what you had to say to be the gospel and i want to thank you for your for
[01:24:32.440 --> 01:24:38.200]  your courage uh the reason i'm calling is uh you were talking this morning about the scientific
[01:24:38.200 --> 01:24:45.640]  dictatorship that we're living in today uh i uh studied president eisenhower and his farewell
[01:24:45.640 --> 01:24:51.320]  address to the nation uh most people just remember the quote about the military industrial complex
[01:24:51.960 --> 01:24:59.480]  uh but he also talks about a scientific technological elite uh that was merging with
[01:24:59.480 --> 01:25:06.200]  that to uh create public policy and to take over the university well yeah i know that
[01:25:06.200 --> 01:25:11.400]  was an exact quote you just gave that quote's actually in our eugenics film that we're working on
[01:25:11.400 --> 01:25:22.040]  yes yeah so i i i really believe that uh the kennedy assassination uh was the lynchpin for the loss
[01:25:22.040 --> 01:25:29.560]  of our uh of our country with regards to our political system i agree with you
[01:25:32.360 --> 01:25:38.520]  that's all i have to say thank you well said woody let's go ahead and talk to nathan in pennsylvania
[01:25:38.520 --> 01:25:43.800]  hey alec how you doing this is great i first time caller i'm really great at have
[01:25:44.680 --> 01:25:48.520]  have great appreciation for you taking the time out to take my call are you bet i mean i love
[01:25:48.520 --> 01:25:53.160]  being here talking to people that love freedom go ahead uh the other caller mentioned about
[01:25:53.160 --> 01:25:57.480]  opting out of this body scanners i thought myself why not off is right alert of the
[01:25:58.040 --> 01:26:01.000]  those uh those in control and say can i opt out of your system
[01:26:02.920 --> 01:26:07.080]  well that's why we have to expose that the terrorism is staged in almost every case
[01:26:07.080 --> 01:26:11.560]  they're doing this to set up the control system for us and that's now admitted
[01:26:11.560 --> 01:26:17.480]  homeland security is for the american people period it was never for cia funded cave dwellers
[01:26:18.280 --> 01:26:24.440]  yeah and i was watching the uh obama thing today uh his speech and he you know it's this whole
[01:26:24.440 --> 01:26:31.160]  illusion of trying to reach out to the common man and and and pretend that they have a connection
[01:26:31.160 --> 01:26:36.440]  when in reality all they've done is they've taken these things that mean something to us you know i
[01:26:36.440 --> 01:26:40.760]  always tell people it's like you got a knife in your kitchen drawer well yeah it's great for
[01:26:40.760 --> 01:26:44.760]  working in the kitchen but as soon as you turn around and stick that in somebody's face it
[01:26:44.760 --> 01:26:49.800]  becomes a weapon and basically the whole system's been designed that way you know whether you look
[01:26:49.800 --> 01:26:57.000]  at the materialism commercialism you got the religion you know with the 501 t3s uh the politics
[01:26:57.000 --> 01:27:03.000]  everybody's just basically in this big dragnet getting sucked under getting sucked under i
[01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:08.600]  appreciate your call really good points nathan and and that's what it comes down to is that
[01:27:08.600 --> 01:27:14.520]  there's counterfeits of everything good and that's how the system controls things and they are
[01:27:14.520 --> 01:27:21.400]  predatory they are ruthless it's stated uh let's go ahead and talk to uh calvin in mariland calvin
[01:27:21.400 --> 01:27:28.360]  you're on the year good afternoon alexis calvin i hope things are going well um i have a couple
[01:27:28.360 --> 01:27:35.240]  questions the first time caller uh one is i like to reach the churches uh and and the leaders um
[01:27:35.240 --> 01:27:43.160]  when i woke up um it was more of a personal interest trying to uh you know debunk the things
[01:27:43.160 --> 01:27:47.320]  that i thought was like there's no way that this could be happening especially when over
[01:27:47.320 --> 01:27:52.520]  70 percent of americans are christian i was like there's no way that something like this could form
[01:27:52.520 --> 01:27:57.480]  and the more and more i dug into it and i kept coming across alex jones guy i'm like who is this
[01:27:57.480 --> 01:28:02.040]  guy and what he's saying has got to be crazy there's no way it could be true and the more
[01:28:02.040 --> 01:28:09.320]  i looked into it i was like oh my goodness it's you know it's i can't find it false well calvin
[01:28:09.320 --> 01:28:14.520]  that's one reason this radio show and the films and the news websites are so successful over 90
[01:28:14.520 --> 01:28:19.240]  percent of the time it's not even my opinion i am covering what is admittedly going on
[01:28:19.240 --> 01:28:24.440]  and i just put the info out for people to decide for themselves if that's a good thing or not
[01:28:24.440 --> 01:28:29.480]  and i put it in a historical context and that's why we're reaching so many people because the
[01:28:29.480 --> 01:28:37.080]  system is so crazy it's it's a group of lunatic control freaks running things and and and they've
[01:28:37.080 --> 01:28:40.920]  tried to train us they're doing it for our own good they're not doing it for our own good
[01:28:42.280 --> 01:28:48.040]  and i agree and i'm i'm at a heart and my my thing is like to help you know get this out
[01:28:48.040 --> 01:28:53.800]  to people but i know like for me you know i want to define truth that was what i want to find
[01:28:53.800 --> 01:29:00.280]  and you know you know always get the answer you want to get when you see truth but um so you know
[01:29:00.280 --> 01:29:05.960]  how do we go to churches and uh you know how i guess the best way is i was looking at you guys
[01:29:05.960 --> 01:29:11.800]  have a i guess a bulk library in game and uh i know you said before like for the sheriff's
[01:29:11.800 --> 01:29:16.680]  stuff like that you should go to uh like i said that don't tell me that yes you need to educate
[01:29:16.680 --> 01:29:20.360]  the sheriff's the county commensures but also your churches but the but it's important to go
[01:29:20.360 --> 01:29:25.720]  to the churches and say are you part of the clergy response teams are you part of the government now
[01:29:25.720 --> 01:29:29.800]  and because of your preachers telling you submit to big government worship government

[01:34:47.080 --> 01:34:52.200]  know what they're talking about well but i'm not opening your eyes i'm just like poking your arm
[01:34:52.200 --> 01:34:57.160]  and saying hey buddy you might wake up and open your own eyes and look around you but the biggest
[01:34:57.160 --> 01:35:02.920]  thing i'm here to push is people need to really realize how deep we've gotten into this i mean
[01:35:02.920 --> 01:35:09.800]  it's bonker land crazy go ahead uh was just at walmart they even had a stand set up there
[01:35:09.800 --> 01:35:13.800]  for people to have flu vaccinations right in the middle of store by the checkout lane
[01:35:13.800 --> 01:35:20.360]  i'm just chuckled as i walked by well they had record numbers of people not take the shots
[01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:25.720]  last year so now they're trying to make it mandatory for medical workers outside of law
[01:35:25.720 --> 01:35:30.360]  and they're just trying to put it everywhere like it's buying a bottle of bottled water
[01:35:30.360 --> 01:35:35.400]  they're making it ubiquitous that's crazy i just watched your end game last night great flick
[01:35:35.400 --> 01:35:45.240]  um also your obama deception blot info there but i'd like to know a little bit more about that georgia
[01:35:45.240 --> 01:35:52.840]  um stone pardon me sir um the georgia guide stones yes sir i'd like to know a little
[01:35:52.840 --> 01:35:59.960]  bit more about that well my film uh end game uh covers it the rosa crucians that are an occultic
[01:35:59.960 --> 01:36:05.560]  pro u n group have a trust and bought the property decades ago and they built these
[01:36:05.560 --> 01:36:10.600]  giant guide stones like stone hinge that call for world government and reducing the world
[01:36:10.600 --> 01:36:17.000]  population to 500 million uh and we covered my film in game blueprint for global enslavement
[01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:20.360]  james i appreciate your call west in utah you're on the air
[01:36:20.360 --> 01:36:30.360]  hello hey west welcome well thank you alex good to be here um gosh i don't know where to
[01:36:30.360 --> 01:36:35.800]  start here you know you have really helped open my eyes as well um first off i'm just surprised
[01:36:35.800 --> 01:36:40.520]  that ksl tv would actually make a story like that everybody got it out in the open about the vaccine
[01:36:41.400 --> 01:36:45.880]  my wife is a nurse and she's kind of been reluctant in you know accepting what you've
[01:36:45.880 --> 01:36:51.080]  been reporting and i know it's all legit but when she she did not take that h1n1 shot
[01:36:51.080 --> 01:36:55.000]  simply because i guess she was suspicious of the fda being so quick to approve it
[01:36:55.560 --> 01:37:01.080]  um and now the british medical journal and the eu commission have come out and admitted
[01:37:01.080 --> 01:37:06.520]  that it was a fraud that it was dangerous and then it was payoffs what can't she understand
[01:37:06.520 --> 01:37:12.760]  about hundreds of vaccines they're trying to make mandatory because drug makers uh are our lobbying
[01:37:12.760 --> 01:37:17.800]  government to do it i mean what do we not know about other drugs being dangerous that they knowingly
[01:37:17.800 --> 01:37:23.480]  get approved or they uh prescribed to children like psychotropics and other things they know
[01:37:23.480 --> 01:37:28.920]  adderall and riddle under causing heart attacks and children i mean they know all of this and i
[01:37:28.920 --> 01:37:34.600]  mean your wife can read the insert can't she she knows that almost every year the flu shot
[01:37:35.880 --> 01:37:41.480]  doesn't even get it right to mirror whatever that year's mutation of the flu is i mean doesn't
[01:37:41.480 --> 01:37:46.040]  she understand that that the white house science are admits that they have a plan
[01:37:46.040 --> 01:37:50.680]  to put poisons in vaccines to dumb people down and sterilize them i mean can you take her to
[01:37:50.680 --> 01:37:56.200]  info wars dot com with direct links to literally hundreds of articles we've written in the last
[01:37:56.200 --> 01:38:01.560]  decade directly to the rockefeller foundation and others admitting they develop these vaccines
[01:38:01.560 --> 01:38:06.920]  the vaccines aren't what you're told therefore that's the issue it's not we don't believe vaccines
[01:38:06.920 --> 01:38:12.360]  couldn't be good we don't believe there isn't something to the science of artificial uh immunity
[01:38:12.360 --> 01:38:18.920]  being acquired it's that the people running things are a bunch of psychopaths well you know alex she
[01:38:18.920 --> 01:38:24.680]  is listening right now in the other room um but you know i think she is coming around here she's
[01:38:24.680 --> 01:38:30.200]  watching your your your movies i've purchased endgame and you know the obama deception thank you
[01:38:30.200 --> 01:38:34.040]  has watched some of these films and she is coming around here another thing that was interesting
[01:38:34.040 --> 01:38:39.000]  just last week i was furious she was traveling in las vegas and they just kind of randomly kind of
[01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:43.800]  selected her she didn't have to go through a naked body scanner or anything but they kind of harassed
[01:38:43.800 --> 01:38:48.680]  her they had a department of homeland enslavement guard put their hands run their hands along her
[01:38:48.680 --> 01:38:53.480]  pants and then after she gets through security she buys a drink a soft drink and then one of
[01:38:53.480 --> 01:38:57.720]  those people come up to her and demand to test her drink i mean it's ridiculous it's harassment
[01:38:57.720 --> 01:39:02.520]  i'm just so angry about that let me break this down to your wife and you it's dog training they
[01:39:02.520 --> 01:39:07.080]  admit it governor ridge said seven years ago as the head of homeland security that they would have
[01:39:07.080 --> 01:39:12.920]  naked body scanners not just at airports but at train stops bus stops then shopping malls then public
[01:39:12.920 --> 01:39:18.440]  schools they always oh take your shoes off take your belt off answer questions go through a naked
[01:39:18.440 --> 01:39:23.400]  body scanner make women you know who've pumped to feed their babies drink their own breast milk
[01:39:23.400 --> 01:39:31.400]  that's happened uh they now squeeze women's body parts uh as enhance pat down all of this is to
[01:39:31.400 --> 01:39:37.080]  train you to have government get in your comfort zone bill clinton signed an executive order to
[01:39:37.080 --> 01:39:42.360]  take blood forcibly to get driver's license now government's proposing it they they they put this
[01:39:42.360 --> 01:39:47.720]  stuff in place but don't implement it right away see so that's the issue the average tsa workers
[01:39:47.720 --> 01:39:51.880]  just somebody you know wanting 15 bucks an hour or whatever they get paid they're on average not
[01:39:51.880 --> 01:39:56.120]  really bad people some of them are control freaks and you know go crazy and announce they're gone at
[01:39:56.120 --> 01:40:00.840]  the airport get arrested or make fun of their staff being put put to the scanners and getting
[01:40:00.840 --> 01:40:05.720]  fist fights or tell women i'll put you in jail if you don't become my sex slave i mean there are
[01:40:05.720 --> 01:40:08.840]  some of them that are control freaks that get into that line of work but most of them are just
[01:40:08.840 --> 01:40:13.560]  citizens like us and they're given the false reason they're doing this but the main reason
[01:40:13.560 --> 01:40:19.320]  it's being done is to train you to have people get in your comfort zone when i was flying around
[01:40:19.320 --> 01:40:26.680]  the country with jesse ventura uh two weeks ago he has a artificial hip uh and every time
[01:40:26.680 --> 01:40:32.360]  and i watched jesse and others be put through mainly older folks and they would pat them they
[01:40:32.360 --> 01:40:37.880]  would squeeze them they would violate them and jesse says he he does he hates it more each time
[01:40:37.880 --> 01:40:43.160]  because it's an act of humiliation and he said you know america's like east germany and he was
[01:40:43.160 --> 01:40:49.480]  griping saying this is nazi germany i'm sick of this and it's all about them lining you up i mean
[01:40:49.480 --> 01:40:54.760]  look at the public schools drug dogs searching your bags thumb scanning to get your school lunch
[01:40:54.760 --> 01:41:00.040]  writing dossiers on your parents i mean this goes on in school now as part of the uh school
[01:41:00.040 --> 01:41:06.200]  curriculum it's all done on computers now so it's being filed with the government this is all
[01:41:06.200 --> 01:41:12.280]  about reengineering society and we have all the proof it's so diabolical sorry go ahead well no
[01:41:12.280 --> 01:41:17.720]  that's why that's why i say i do anything i can right now to keep my son in private school um
[01:41:17.720 --> 01:41:22.760]  uh we're a two-income family here and anyway but my wife and i are just making sacrifices to keep
[01:41:22.760 --> 01:41:27.800]  my son in private school and ten years old now and very bright and they they're really big on the
[01:41:27.800 --> 01:41:33.000]  constitution and property rights and that's why they want to wreck the society so that you can't
[01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:38.120]  escape and your child will be taught how to use drugs will be caught how to take Gardasil and
[01:41:38.120 --> 01:41:42.040]  i want to force it on boys i mean the Gardasil shot admits it doesn't even protect you from
[01:41:42.040 --> 01:41:46.760]  papilloma but they don't care i mean that's what's so insane god bless you west i appreciate your

[01:41:51.960 --> 01:41:58.520]  news blitzing now let me go over this report and for those that think we're making this up here's
[01:41:58.520 --> 01:42:05.480]  msnbc uk proposals all paychecks go to the state first the uk's tax collection agency is putting
[01:42:05.480 --> 01:42:11.160]  forth a proposal that all employers send employee paychecks to the government after which the
[01:42:11.160 --> 01:42:15.240]  government would deduct what it deems as the appropriate tax and pay the employers
[01:42:15.240 --> 01:42:23.640]  by bank transfer the proposal by her majesty's revenue and customs stresses the need for employers
[01:42:23.640 --> 01:42:27.320]  to provide real-time information the government so they can monitor all payments and make better
[01:42:27.320 --> 01:42:33.400]  assessment of whether the correct tax is being made gotta have a license to have a garden they've
[01:42:33.400 --> 01:42:40.120]  got that legislation in congress uh gotta you're guilty until proven innocent uh they're coming in
[01:42:40.120 --> 01:42:50.040]  with taxes and regulation and inspectors for swap meets and for bazaars uh and for uh garage sales
[01:42:50.040 --> 01:43:00.280]  it's about total surveillance of everything you do so uh paul watson put together a report and
[01:43:00.280 --> 01:43:06.680]  actually guys when we printed this and only printed the front page so uh can you print me the full
[01:43:06.680 --> 01:43:10.360]  article or i guess i can read it off screen actually just it's kind of hard because it's
[01:43:10.360 --> 01:43:18.280]  across the room uh this is a prisonplanet.com uh detailed report uh government prepares to
[01:43:18.280 --> 01:43:25.800]  seize paychecks as status cancer explodes and finland does things similar to this the government
[01:43:25.800 --> 01:43:31.880]  controls your bank account everything must be done digitally and this is how they fully control
[01:43:31.880 --> 01:43:38.520]  the system forget big government the same elite policies cause the financial collapse
[01:43:38.520 --> 01:43:43.320]  are now ready to launch the next phase of their fascist takeover the economy and then they can
[01:43:43.320 --> 01:43:46.440]  also track everything you're doing they already under know your customer track your bank account
[01:43:46.440 --> 01:43:51.240]  in live time by forcing businesses to send employee paychecks straight to the government
[01:43:52.280 --> 01:43:56.840]  who would then deduct the appropriate tax before the employee receives their wage
[01:43:56.840 --> 01:44:03.480]  as the status cancer of collectivism grows they just raise the vat tax on on top of their
[01:44:03.480 --> 01:44:09.400]  income tax over there the proposal represents another hammer blow to financial privacy as the
[01:44:09.400 --> 01:44:13.880]  establishment moves towards a total cashless society where every transaction is tracked
[01:44:13.880 --> 01:44:19.560]  traced to control by the authorities the uk's tax collection agency is putting forth a proposal
[01:44:19.560 --> 01:44:24.120]  that all employees send employee paychecks to the government after which the government would
[01:44:24.120 --> 01:44:30.600]  deduct what it deems as the appropriate tax payment for the employee bank transfer and of
[01:44:30.600 --> 01:44:36.280]  course cnbc doesn't call this a police state it's a wonderful the system would be run by the same
[01:44:36.280 --> 01:44:42.760]  organization her majesty's revenue and customs that has become notorious for its botch handling of
[01:44:42.760 --> 01:44:47.320]  data and incorrect tax calculations that are always higher it's not incorrect which have forced
[01:44:47.320 --> 01:44:52.200]  people to spend months and even years trying to claim back unfairly claimed money seized by the
[01:44:52.200 --> 01:44:59.880]  tax man but this story is about as far more than the threat of mere bureaucracy or bumbling incompetence
[01:44:59.880 --> 01:45:06.040]  this is about the system exploring the economic crisis it caused as a pretext to completely
[01:45:06.040 --> 01:45:12.440]  dominate and control our lives this is about the state handing itself the power to arbitrarily
[01:45:12.440 --> 01:45:18.600]  raise taxes to a new level any level it desires and then automatically seize the money with no
[01:45:18.600 --> 01:45:25.000]  chance of redress or petition on behalf of the taxpayer see it's about not even giving you the
[01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:30.360]  choice it's about you're a criminal you're guilty your check goes to the government and then you're
[01:45:30.360 --> 01:45:35.000]  lucky if you get anything then they raise the tax until you go bankrupt then you go on the dole
[01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:39.480]  now you're under government eugenics health care now they can phase you out with the death panels
[01:45:39.480 --> 01:45:44.120]  and they can tell the government workers or people on government contracts kill granny you get 10
[01:45:44.120 --> 01:45:51.560]  jobs this is the post industrial deindustrialization system openly announced by the white house
[01:45:51.560 --> 01:45:57.240]  scientists are and others this is the global plan this is what i have coined the term social
[01:45:57.240 --> 01:46:02.040]  cannibalism what do you think mal did killing 80 plus million people the chinese government
[01:46:02.040 --> 01:46:07.320]  states our government 64 mil they say whatever the point is this is what they do this is their system
[01:46:09.160 --> 01:46:14.040]  but this story is about far more than the threat of mere bureaucracy or bumbling incompetence
[01:46:14.040 --> 01:46:18.680]  this is about the system exploiting the economic crisis it causes a pretext to completely dominate
[01:46:18.680 --> 01:46:23.800]  and control our lives this is about the state handing itself the power to arbitrarily raise taxes
[01:46:23.800 --> 01:46:29.480]  at any level it desires and then automatically seize the money with no chance of redress or petition
[01:46:29.480 --> 01:46:35.080]  on behalf of the taxpayer and it's about a cashless society look the government has said in the near
[01:46:35.080 --> 01:46:39.880]  future you will face scan and they now are going in everywhere it scans you from 8 to 10 feet with
[01:46:39.880 --> 01:46:45.080]  a laser you don't have to know you know stop for it to scan your eyes and if you haven't paid taxes
[01:46:45.080 --> 01:46:50.120]  they're saying you won't be allowed to use your card or buy or sell and we've already got banks
[01:46:50.120 --> 01:46:54.440]  harassing patriots and conservatives and libertarians for their purchases and what they're
[01:46:54.440 --> 01:47:00.360]  doing this is a total nightmare grid we have to respond by going more and more to a barter economy
[01:47:00.360 --> 01:47:06.600]  so these criminals can't have their way with us again slave masters keep the slaves dependent
[01:47:06.600 --> 01:47:12.440]  this is real this is happening this will happen here in the u.s. this is the worldwide plan
[01:47:12.440 --> 01:47:18.600]  england's always the beta test allied to the proposal will be a new program that will force
[01:47:18.600 --> 01:47:23.080]  middle-class families to take government lie detector test that that's a quote which are
[01:47:23.080 --> 01:47:27.400]  notoriously unreliable and an immiscible in court part of an intrusive tax investigations into
[01:47:27.400 --> 01:47:31.880]  their financial affairs so now the government's going to come out with a mobile lie detector
[01:47:31.880 --> 01:47:39.320]  test not when you're charged but preemptively worse than 1984 and now 500 mobile vans blasting
[01:47:39.320 --> 01:47:46.600]  your house with high-powered radiation in the u.s. they lie about everything they're just completely
[01:47:47.960 --> 01:47:52.760]  and totally criminal and and for some reason this is malfunctioning and it just double printed the
[01:47:52.760 --> 01:47:57.480]  article so i'm going to go to the article itself i'm not the best news reader reading from a distance
[01:47:57.480 --> 01:48:04.440]  but i'll be able to do this let me go ahead and continue here allied to the proposal will be a
[01:48:04.440 --> 01:48:09.080]  new program that will force middle-class families to take government lie detector tests which are
[01:48:09.080 --> 01:48:13.800]  notoriously unreliable and an inadmissible in court as part of intrusive tax investigations in
[01:48:13.800 --> 01:48:24.280]  their financial affairs prime minister david cameron and his sidekick nick clagg's promise to
[01:48:24.280 --> 01:48:28.840]  deconstruct the big brother state in britain has proven to be completely fraudulent this is big
[01:48:28.840 --> 01:48:35.800]  brother on steroids and it mimics a myriad of other programs on both sides of the pond that are
[01:48:35.800 --> 01:48:42.520]  being enforced as part of the same move towards total regulation and control over every aspect of
[01:48:42.520 --> 01:48:46.200]  our existence left a gauge how to properly shut down the economy and if you've got a black market
[01:48:46.200 --> 01:48:50.520]  economy to survive you're not totally under their control so they've got to remove that you can't
[01:48:50.520 --> 01:48:55.400]  have the rats finding a little piece of cheese here in there now let's continue local tax authorities
[01:48:55.400 --> 01:49:00.760]  such as pennsylvania telling residents we know where you live and threatening to use satellite
[01:49:00.760 --> 01:49:06.520]  imaging technology to track them down for claiming back taxes remember that so-called smart meters
[01:49:06.520 --> 01:49:11.320]  being introduced by law to allow utility companies and the government to regulate energy consumption
[01:49:11.320 --> 01:49:14.760]  remotely first they lied and said they wouldn't do it now they admit they're doing it remotely
[01:49:15.480 --> 01:49:19.800]  government plans to dictate what kind of household appliances people are allowed to own and what kind
[01:49:19.800 --> 01:49:27.800]  of light bulbs they can use fees and restrictions on garage sales and any kind of independent local
[01:49:27.800 --> 01:49:33.800]  community driven economic activity legislation aimed at preventing people from sharing trading
[01:49:33.800 --> 01:49:39.880]  or selling homegrown food as part of total homeland security takeover of all u.s food
[01:49:39.880 --> 01:49:45.400]  and u.s farms same things happening in europe the exact same system then by law they won't allow you
[01:49:45.400 --> 01:49:51.800]  to buy food in the store hard core evil and i couldn't even buy big league big league chew for
[01:49:51.800 --> 01:49:57.480]  my kids you know bubblegum because it had aspartame now added every major sugar gum now that added
[01:49:58.920 --> 01:50:04.280]  deadly brain damage every new assault the state launches against us is forced
[01:50:05.720 --> 01:50:12.600]  around increasing our dependence on big brother and making us destitute unable to survive without
[01:50:12.600 --> 01:50:17.080]  welfare people in the united kingdom of the united states need to understand that their
[01:50:17.080 --> 01:50:22.920]  governments are malevolent and that their primary purpose is to obliterate the middle class by
[01:50:22.920 --> 01:50:28.760]  forcing them to become dependent on the state this is war folks against you as the cost of living
[01:50:28.760 --> 01:50:32.840]  swords as tax hikes go through the roof and as austerity fascism starts to bite governments
[01:50:32.840 --> 01:50:37.080]  are now moving to prevent people from becoming self-sufficient dashing the only hope of avoiding
[01:50:37.080 --> 01:50:41.960]  poverty for many ally with the march of green fascism the economic crisis has been ruthlessly
[01:50:41.960 --> 01:50:47.000]  exploited by the elite to empower the state to wholly subjugate the people under the thumb of
[01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:51.560]  big government every step they take is about enriching themselves politically and financially
[01:50:51.560 --> 01:50:56.760]  while ensuring our only recourse is to beg for handouts in return for allowing ourselves to
[01:50:56.760 --> 01:51:02.440]  become slaves whose every action is controlled catalog judged and can hi this is alex jones

[01:54:21.240 --> 01:54:27.720]  and one of the most diabolical facets of this is the trillions of dollars spent on defense and
[01:54:27.720 --> 01:54:39.320]  security is now our economy the majority of the new uh tuitions the grants uh that are being funded
[01:54:41.400 --> 01:54:47.560]  in universities in the west and japan as well are for data mining are for spying are for running
[01:54:47.560 --> 01:54:53.960]  naked body scanners are for controlling this and then the government funds globalist companies
[01:54:53.960 --> 01:55:01.000]  that we then buy these systems from and so they're making it where the only jobs you'll be able to
[01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:05.400]  get is in the control grid either in the prison or working basically in the gulags
[01:55:08.040 --> 01:55:14.040]  it's so horrible meanwhile the third world has had its development blocked by the imf world bank
[01:55:14.040 --> 01:55:18.920]  as part of their official policy they're starving to death begging to come here the globalists then
[01:55:18.920 --> 01:55:24.600]  bring them here to drive down wages they get them on the political plantation to vote for more
[01:55:24.600 --> 01:55:31.320]  socialism more handouts and they're trying to fully convert the military over to majority foreigner
[01:55:32.120 --> 01:55:36.600]  and they put out this idea that americans don't want to work only illegal aliens can do it we've
[01:55:36.600 --> 01:55:40.760]  got to legalize them give them free tuition and then let them bring their families in
[01:55:40.760 --> 01:55:51.880]  here's colon pal promoting the new act that they are trying to attach the immigration act
[01:55:51.880 --> 01:55:58.440]  on to the defense budget that's set to be voted on as early as tomorrow here's that clip we have
[01:55:58.440 --> 01:56:04.360]  millions and millions of illegal immigrants in our country undocumented individuals who are working
[01:56:04.360 --> 01:56:08.920]  who are doing things we need done in this country they're all over my house doing things whenever
[01:56:08.920 --> 01:56:13.640]  i call for repairs i'm sure you've seen them at your house we've got to find a way to bring
[01:56:13.640 --> 01:56:19.160]  these people out of the darkness and give them some kind of status in the next few years we will
[01:56:19.160 --> 01:56:26.280]  discover that between the ages of 15 and 64 the working ages of our people most of those are going
[01:56:26.280 --> 01:56:31.880]  to be kept in that age group because of immigration and the children of immigrants whereas in other
[01:56:31.880 --> 01:56:36.920]  parts of the world the age of the population is getting older and fewer people are working so i'm
[01:56:36.920 --> 01:56:42.200]  telling you i'm telling all of my my my citizens around the country is that immigration is what's
[01:56:42.200 --> 01:56:47.800]  keeping this country's lifeblood moving forward they enrich our culture with every generation
[01:56:47.800 --> 01:56:54.280]  we have to find a way so he says we're going to discover we don't have any children anymore because
[01:56:54.280 --> 01:57:00.760]  of liberalism because of eugenics because don't have a kid it's horrible now they won't let the
[01:57:00.760 --> 01:57:06.520]  third world develop they block them through their official policies then they come here and turn us
[01:57:06.520 --> 01:57:13.720]  into a third world country you understand that and that's their program that's their plan that's
[01:57:13.720 --> 01:57:20.760]  their operation and then they use these people as a weapon and the dream act is to make these people
[01:57:20.760 --> 01:57:25.800]  all members of the military and i'm sorry folks you can see the statistics the biggest recruiting
[01:57:25.800 --> 01:57:31.240]  centers for the military are not in the united states they're in eastern europe they're in the
[01:57:31.240 --> 01:57:37.160]  philippines they're in mexico city and this is the same british model of foreigners that can't
[01:57:37.160 --> 01:57:42.280]  even speak english ruling over us you are the enemy remember in all the homeland security reports
[01:57:42.280 --> 01:57:48.680]  that have been leaked to us it's focused on landowners ranchers farmers business owners they hate you
[01:57:49.480 --> 01:57:55.880]  and the white house science are has said they want a post industrial united states that is their goal
[01:57:55.880 --> 01:58:02.680]  i know it's hard for people to believe and deal with but it's the reality we're gonna go to break
[01:58:02.680 --> 01:58:06.520]  and come back and hit some more news in the first five minutes segment that max keiser's coming on

[02:00:17.720 --> 02:00:27.000]  and now live from austin texas alex jones paul joseph watson has written a devastating article
[02:00:27.000 --> 02:00:33.800]  it is so vital british government to seize all paychecks
[02:00:36.440 --> 02:00:42.920]  do you think slaves on a plantation in georgia in 1825 were allowed to have their own paycheck
[02:00:42.920 --> 02:00:49.160]  or keep money or have a weapon no the british people are slaves and the government knows that
[02:00:49.160 --> 02:00:53.320]  they're going to put up with it they'll submit to it so the sky's the limit as thomas jefferson
[02:00:53.320 --> 02:00:58.120]  said the exact level of tyranny you'll live under is whatever you'll put up with and the federal
[02:00:58.120 --> 02:01:02.600]  government and others want a similar system here that's why they want quote automatic transfer by
[02:01:02.600 --> 02:01:08.360]  law because the government already controls the banks this is their system this is the
[02:01:08.360 --> 02:01:14.440]  cashless society max geyser is coming up i'm going to raise this with him and a lot more
[02:01:14.440 --> 02:01:19.640]  but right now i wanted to go back to some of your phone calls john in illinois you're on the year
[02:01:20.520 --> 02:01:30.200]  hey alex hey buddy yes i do okay um i actually used to be a former employee at the sec i won't
[02:01:30.200 --> 02:01:36.440]  say which office but it was actually during the whole madeoff thing and what was pretty
[02:01:36.440 --> 02:01:40.440]  interesting i have two points i want to raise um well for those that don't know that just joined
[02:01:40.440 --> 02:01:45.880]  us for 11 years they were sent in dossiers on exactly what madeoff was doing and they protected
[02:01:45.880 --> 02:01:53.480]  him yes they did they certainly did and uh i received uh an email and i um i was a low level
[02:01:53.480 --> 02:01:58.520]  employee um i did not know much while i worked there uh they didn't share much information
[02:01:58.520 --> 02:02:05.480]  with me but uh i received an email saying that any sort of evidence or files concerning the
[02:02:05.480 --> 02:02:11.640]  matter uh the matter with eric swanson who was the attorney who um i believe was involved in it
[02:02:11.640 --> 02:02:17.880]  uh that they would be immediately recused so that i think points to their involvement in a cover-up
[02:02:18.920 --> 02:02:24.680]  well the sec under the new federal reserve rules is given total anonymity and secrecy to
[02:02:24.680 --> 02:02:30.520]  commit even more crimes but it's an arm of the government and i think they should be held responsible
[02:02:30.520 --> 02:02:35.160]  don't you i mean sir i do look it turns out 11 years ago right around the time they got
[02:02:35.160 --> 02:02:40.680]  out of glass steel the veterans affairs made a secret deal with the major insurance companies
[02:02:40.680 --> 02:02:46.280]  to steal the death benefits of six million vets i mean that's bloomberg that's what i'm saying
[02:02:46.280 --> 02:02:52.680]  these people are total criminals they're stealing trillions a year and they're not gonna stop until
[02:02:52.680 --> 02:02:59.240]  we really wake up that that's what i'm saying the corruption is light years past what i can even
[02:02:59.240 --> 02:03:08.040]  verbally articulate and the public knows something's wrong but still has only woken up to one micron
[02:03:08.600 --> 02:03:14.280]  of how serious it is but but absolutely the sec are a pack of criminals any real company that's
[02:03:14.280 --> 02:03:19.240]  america and patria they go after them and arrest them for crooked toenails but if you're a total
[02:03:19.240 --> 02:03:26.360]  criminal stealing a hundred bill you are protected yeah i mean it's the largest party scheme i just
[02:03:26.360 --> 02:03:31.640]  found it kind of curious that anybody who had evidence would be immediately recused um but it's
[02:03:31.640 --> 02:03:36.280]  the largest one man that we know of but the federal reserve system itself is a galactic
[02:03:36.280 --> 02:03:43.640]  ponzi scheme and now they're rolling that into a global carbon tax global ponzi right right um
[02:03:43.640 --> 02:03:49.880]  and i just wanted to mention one more thing uh our tax dollars are uh being spent very well
[02:03:49.880 --> 02:03:55.480]  because on several occasions one in particular i uh actually walked in the office of an attorney
[02:03:55.480 --> 02:04:02.360]  who was sleeping on the floor really yeah and i heard stories about other people who had been
[02:04:02.360 --> 02:04:08.760]  fired from uh u.s. attorney's office jobs for slacking off watching baseball games things like that
[02:04:08.760 --> 02:04:15.160]  so if anybody wants to know whether or not their tax dollars are going to a good cause there you go
[02:04:15.720 --> 02:04:20.440]  well i appreciate your call sir you ought to write a report about it use a pseudonym uh but
[02:04:20.440 --> 02:04:28.520]  but the federal government is growing by leaps and bounds and it's not i mean we have cancer
[02:04:28.520 --> 02:04:36.920]  the the world has cancer it's called tyranny and it's in our lungs our brain our skin our liver
[02:04:36.920 --> 02:04:43.960]  our kidneys our intestines uh it's in our eyes it's in our mouth it's in our throat it's in our
[02:04:43.960 --> 02:04:52.040]  fingers it's in our bones and they're just saying hey this is a great deal and europe's under the
[02:04:52.040 --> 02:04:58.360]  same control and people again i go back to this they have to wake up to the fact that it is just
[02:04:58.360 --> 02:05:05.000]  all rotten and has to be replaced when you're out on the road the last place you want to be

[02:09:11.880 --> 02:09:18.840]  a document cam shot police here uh recession officially ended in june 2009 of course all the
[02:09:18.840 --> 02:09:24.360]  mainline economists we talk to say we've been in a recession for at least five years uh two years
[02:09:24.360 --> 02:09:30.440]  of a recession uh is is really a depression uh we're talking about four five six years depending
[02:09:30.440 --> 02:09:36.360]  on how you cut it now the government's cook numbers say 9.6 unemployment the real number is above 22
[02:09:37.560 --> 02:09:44.360]  you've just got massive systemic layoffs you've got the uh greatest level of poverty the census
[02:09:44.360 --> 02:09:51.320]  bureau admits in over 50 years but that doesn't matter alan greenspan and others a recession
[02:09:51.320 --> 02:09:57.320]  officially ended in june of 09 the great recession now it's the great recession ended in june 2009
[02:09:57.320 --> 02:10:03.560]  according to uh the body charged with dating when economic downturns began and in but the news comes
[02:10:03.560 --> 02:10:09.080]  amid rising fears of a double dip recession now they're saying it's a double-dip housing market
[02:10:09.080 --> 02:10:15.560]  but but it never came back uh and uh it continues uh here the national bureau of economic research
[02:10:15.560 --> 02:10:19.480]  independent group of economists released statement monday saying economic data now clearly points the
[02:10:19.480 --> 02:10:27.400]  economy turning higher last summer so 15 months ago uh max next they're going to tell me that the
[02:10:27.400 --> 02:10:38.360]  moon is made of cheese well look the the way the economy is measured is uh gdp and over the past 20
[02:10:38.360 --> 02:10:45.480]  years the amount of debt that has had been taken on is is increased exponentially so for every dollar
[02:10:45.480 --> 02:10:52.120]  of debt 25 years ago that produced a dollar in gdp up until 2007 it took something like
[02:10:52.120 --> 02:10:59.240]  eight dollars of debt to produce the same dollar of gdp so the gdp masks the fact that for 25 years
[02:10:59.240 --> 02:11:03.560]  the american economy has assumed hundreds of billions and trillions of dollars with the debt
[02:11:03.560 --> 02:11:11.160]  starting in 2007 and then gathering speed in 2008 that debt implosion of course started to
[02:11:11.160 --> 02:11:17.800]  to create havoc in the economy obama obama came in they threw in some stimulus they threw in a
[02:11:17.800 --> 02:11:24.280]  bank bailout that created a short-term ripple some lasted about six months that ended all the
[02:11:24.280 --> 02:11:30.600]  subsidies for housing are over the make work programs are over the primary trend is is this
[02:11:30.600 --> 02:11:36.280]  contraction and we're an even greater debt now that's right the debt has increased that's exactly
[02:11:36.280 --> 02:11:42.440]  right the debt has increased and it's increased uh to the point where central banks are doubting
[02:11:42.440 --> 02:11:49.560]  whether america will be able to pay its bills here to for ipso facto they are buying gold
[02:11:49.560 --> 02:11:56.040]  so central banks for the first time in decades are are buying gold up until recently they were
[02:11:56.040 --> 02:12:01.880]  net sellers of gold now they're actually buying gold so this is another huge piece of the equation
[02:12:01.880 --> 02:12:06.920]  for gold you've got central banks plus all that smart money in the hedge fund community
[02:12:06.920 --> 02:12:13.320]  like john paulson like uh paul thuder jones in in the u.s they're buying gold now
[02:12:15.960 --> 02:12:24.440]  and so gold is uh just 13 14 dollars away uh from hitting 1300 the bloomberg reported as you
[02:12:24.440 --> 02:12:30.360]  know max two weeks ago that the most popular futures option on gold in the month of december
[02:12:30.360 --> 02:12:40.520]  uh in uh new york and chicago is 1500 smackers uh and even mainline Reuters and cnbc are saying
[02:12:40.520 --> 02:12:46.920]  people are doing this because even if it's not made public quantitative easing is accelerating
[02:12:46.920 --> 02:12:53.160]  money printing is accelerating uh that the monetization of debt is accelerating what does
[02:12:53.160 --> 02:12:58.520]  a how high do you think gold will go before christmas and b what does all this mean to the real
[02:12:58.520 --> 02:13:06.040]  economy well since i've been on your show really i'm two main things gold and the casino gulag
[02:13:06.680 --> 02:13:13.480]  gold certainly um is benefiting now from what i saw and what others like box happening on your
[02:13:13.480 --> 02:13:19.960]  show i've seen is that there's a breakdown of trust in these in these banks and in these economies
[02:13:19.960 --> 02:13:25.800]  around the world and they're being net buyers of gold ultimately this means that gold will be a factor
[02:13:25.800 --> 02:13:34.520]  again in terms of backing the the the dollar or some some let's say that it does back the good the
[02:13:34.520 --> 02:13:40.920]  dollar you've got roughly 1.7 trillion in what's called m1 the most readily accessible money
[02:13:41.480 --> 02:13:47.400]  component in the u.s divided by america's gold supply if they monetize the cash into gold that
[02:13:47.400 --> 02:13:52.680]  we're talking about five thousand dollars an ounce uh jim rickard who's an excellent commentator he's
[02:13:52.680 --> 02:14:01.560]  on cnbc all the time he used to work on wall street as a credit analyst and as a guy who monitors all
[02:14:01.560 --> 02:14:06.200]  of the bank regulations for banks is a very knowledgeable guy he made the case for five
[02:14:06.200 --> 02:14:10.920]  thousand dollar an ounce gold this week the very compelling case and they're also making 50
[02:14:10.920 --> 02:14:17.560]  dollar an ounce silver well the old high on silver was 50 if you remember the hunt brothers the back
[02:14:17.560 --> 02:14:23.960]  of the 80s they made a run on the cornering the silver market they got to 50 but i think you know
[02:14:23.960 --> 02:14:28.920]  sure silver is going to break out and it's an interesting play because it's both an industrial
[02:14:28.920 --> 02:14:33.960]  metal as well as a precious metal and i just look at the gold because this is the one that the central
[02:14:33.960 --> 02:14:39.480]  banks and the global economies and the global currencies key on the on the gold market on top
[02:14:39.480 --> 02:14:44.440]  of that if you can look at silver and say yes silver will piggyback gold and probably on a
[02:14:44.440 --> 02:14:50.760]  percentage basis outperform gold but in terms of talking about macroeconomics gold is is the one
[02:14:50.760 --> 02:14:57.320]  issue that everyone has now got to come to terms with now uh correct me if i'm wrong from your
[02:14:57.320 --> 02:15:05.320]  research but the central banks have tried to suppress the price of uh gold for decades because
[02:15:05.320 --> 02:15:11.640]  it competes with their fiat derivative uh counterfeit instruments uh now it appears that they're
[02:15:11.640 --> 02:15:17.960]  beginning to at least partially capitulate to the fact that uh gold is not going to be able to be
[02:15:17.960 --> 02:15:26.280]  suppressed well that plus another major factor um is that the industry itself the biggest producers
[02:15:26.920 --> 02:15:33.160]  of gold miners the biggest gold miners in the world have for the past 25 years had large
[02:15:33.160 --> 02:15:39.720]  short positions or they were hedging their gold production books these big producers are now
[02:15:39.720 --> 02:15:44.520]  closing down their hedge positions they are now buying back all of their short positions they're
[02:15:44.520 --> 02:15:52.040]  going all in they realize that at the current cost uh they're rough their costs at 400 or 500
[02:15:52.040 --> 02:15:57.320]  or 600 dollars an ounce to produce gold it makes no sense to hedge their books at all it makes no
[02:15:57.320 --> 02:16:03.000]  sense to hedge uh to sell short any gold they totally uh don't believe now when they hear
[02:16:03.000 --> 02:16:07.960]  wall street and the central banks are going to try to at least outgoal to keep the price
[02:16:07.960 --> 02:16:12.280]  that aren't officially suppressed as you just mentioned so the industry itself is saying we're
[02:16:12.280 --> 02:16:18.040]  all in we're no longer hedged we're buyers of gold hedge funds are big buyers of gold
[02:16:18.040 --> 02:16:23.320]  central banks are buyers of gold uh foreign governments are big buyers of gold now the one
[02:16:23.320 --> 02:16:29.880]  buyer the one absent in this equation is the retail investor less than one percent of the one
[02:16:29.880 --> 02:16:36.120]  trillion or so of investable assets around the world less than one percent is invested in gold
[02:16:36.120 --> 02:16:39.240]  that's right and when they finally come to the party that's when we could see the five
[02:16:39.240 --> 02:16:42.760]  thousand dollar announces what the economists are saying i mean because they still remember
[02:16:42.760 --> 02:16:48.360]  the media saying don't buy gold invest in enron and they're still holding on to penny stock enron
[02:16:48.360 --> 02:16:54.440]  and in sending me email saying i'm a kook you know i said invest in gold when it was 260 bucks
[02:16:54.440 --> 02:16:59.720]  now it's up at 1300 and they're sending me emails saying i'm a piece of trash and i mean they really
[02:16:59.720 --> 02:17:07.320]  believe in enron stock gold here here's the way to think about it gold right now is still in a
[02:17:07.320 --> 02:17:13.960]  bear market it hasn't even started it's a bull market even after nine straight years of 20 percent
[02:17:13.960 --> 02:17:20.360]  game compared to the games that will come once this market that gets gets hot and that's because
[02:17:20.360 --> 02:17:26.440]  they've artificially suppressed it for decades that's right so you'll see gaps of 200 300
[02:17:26.440 --> 02:17:32.120]  dollar moves in a day that that's what we're talking about then it'll be a real bull market
[02:17:32.120 --> 02:17:36.440]  then everybody will be buying gold then you're talking five thousand dollars an ounce then the
[02:17:36.440 --> 02:17:42.360]  politically it'll completely transform economic will there ever be a time to dump it yeah of course
[02:17:43.720 --> 02:17:49.240]  but at that point uh in other words you want to be in a position where you can sell gold
[02:17:49.240 --> 02:17:56.680]  and you're able to buy assets for uh incredible and that brings the new problem they've got uh
[02:17:56.680 --> 02:18:03.880]  democratic operatives mainly trying to come in and demonize the entire gold market uh just because
[02:18:03.880 --> 02:18:10.200]  of glenn beck uh and i don't see that being effective well the government the federal
[02:18:10.200 --> 02:18:15.480]  government here's you know it's it's you know as the price gets higher it becomes more of a problem
[02:18:15.480 --> 02:18:21.560]  because it it shows the change in negative way on the system the banking system the fiat currency
[02:18:21.560 --> 02:18:27.800]  system as it gets higher you're going to hear about such things as well maybe gold should be taxed
[02:18:27.800 --> 02:18:33.720]  adding the absorbent rate as a way to try to control a gold ownership of course confiscation
[02:18:33.720 --> 02:18:38.360]  they've tried before but you've already paid taxes on the money that you used to buy the gold
[02:18:38.360 --> 02:18:44.760]  yeah but i'm saying that they could say for gold this administration has
[02:18:45.560 --> 02:18:52.040]  incredible power i mean the obama deception is unfortunately it's all too real you know they
[02:18:52.040 --> 02:18:56.120]  took all of the abusive powers of the bush administration and they've repackaged it as
[02:18:56.120 --> 02:19:01.960]  the obama administration they've got incredible power they could simply say anyone who owns gold
[02:19:01.960 --> 02:19:06.680]  is a terrorist and we're going to tax you ninety oh yeah they're set to pass amnesty this week
[02:19:06.680 --> 02:19:12.840]  nobody wants it they just say we don't care so you can't put anything by him there's no rule of law
[02:19:12.840 --> 02:19:18.200]  there's no there's no justice i mean so this is this is going to be the problem on the other end
[02:19:18.200 --> 02:19:24.280]  of the equation if gold will go to five thousand then the problem is going to be the tax problem
[02:19:24.280 --> 02:19:28.920]  it's going to be the confiscation problem there'll be other problems with it it's not going to be a
[02:19:28.920 --> 02:19:32.840]  smooth sailing and it's just not going to be a straight shot to five thousand and game over
[02:19:32.840 --> 02:19:37.880]  there's always there's a great it's all as always all markets are always dynamic there's a lot of
[02:19:37.880 --> 02:19:43.160]  things a lot of moving parts but clearly the trend for gold is higher when do you see it being five
[02:19:43.160 --> 02:19:48.200]  thousand answer that when we come back max kaiser's our guest we'll get into england and that's a
[02:19:48.200 --> 02:19:53.000]  trend they want to set up here where all paychecks are seized by the government now you can't make

[02:24:09.560 --> 02:24:17.320]  the latest developments on that front the economy we're phasing over to coming up uh but max uh i
[02:24:17.320 --> 02:24:22.440]  want to get into british government to seize all paychecks that's up on info wars dot com our
[02:24:22.440 --> 02:24:29.960]  detailed article cnbc has its own headline about how good it is uh uk proposes all paychecks go to
[02:24:29.960 --> 02:24:39.480]  the state first but before we get to that when do you see gold going up above 1300 1500 2000
[02:24:40.760 --> 02:24:46.280]  well they've been appreciating at about 21 percent a year for the past nine years
[02:24:47.000 --> 02:24:51.160]  and so that's the path that it's on i think that we can look forward to seeing it
[02:24:51.160 --> 02:24:57.560]  make those types of moves so let's call it 20 percent so uh you know you're talking five six
[02:24:57.560 --> 02:25:02.760]  hundred dollars a year at this point um and you know just keeping making leaps and bounds
[02:25:02.760 --> 02:25:07.720]  continuing to go higher yeah i mean it's exponential once it gets to 2000 you know then it jumps
[02:25:07.720 --> 02:25:13.320]  quickly to 3000 well yeah once once it'll attract it'll track that retail investor there'll be a
[02:25:13.320 --> 02:25:19.240]  buying panic it'll overshoot i mean the fair market value for gold is probably somewhere
[02:25:19.240 --> 02:25:24.360]  between five and ten thousand but it'll overshoot just like the housing market overshoot the dot
[02:25:24.360 --> 02:25:29.240]  com overshoot uh you know all markets overshoot both on the upside and the downside the real
[02:25:29.240 --> 02:25:34.040]  state market america the fair market value is probably 20 percent down for what is now
[02:25:34.040 --> 02:25:38.600]  but it'll overshoot it'll go down to another 50 or 60 percent but as usual the yuppies won't
[02:25:38.600 --> 02:25:44.360]  invest till right at the when the bubble's about to burst well they'll be you know the the classic
[02:25:44.360 --> 02:25:48.680]  sign is when you know your company cab and the cab drivers talking about all the gold that they're
[02:25:48.680 --> 02:25:53.160]  buying i mean it people think that it gold is widely owned at this point yeah when the shoes
[02:25:53.160 --> 02:25:58.440]  shine boys telling you to buy gold get out yeah that this is a fame well you know at some point
[02:25:58.440 --> 02:26:06.360]  when it becomes just uh you know like the dot com craze i remember barbara strizan was calling our
[02:26:06.360 --> 02:26:13.240]  office to buy shares of i you know it just became an insane mania like the dot com mania gold should
[02:26:13.240 --> 02:26:17.720]  get into a dot com mania which means it's going to overshoot on the upside it's a very limited
[02:26:17.720 --> 02:26:21.560]  supply there's only there's less than three and a half trillion dollars of available gold
[02:26:21.560 --> 02:26:27.000]  there's 700 trillion dollars in bad derivatives and bad debt try forcing you know hundreds of
[02:26:27.000 --> 02:26:32.120]  trillions of dollars with a bad debt through a very small aperture which is the current gold
[02:26:32.120 --> 02:26:38.280]  price and something's got to give and that's the price so you're talking about three thousand
[02:26:38.280 --> 02:26:50.200]  dollar an ounce gold in five years well you know i'm just saying that uh 24 20 3000 182 i mean i'm
[02:26:50.200 --> 02:26:56.520]  looking for just yeah you didn't do a suckers game when you start to try to pick the price
[02:26:56.520 --> 02:27:01.240]  and the time because you say well i've got time and i'm going to wait and i'll buy it right before
[02:27:01.240 --> 02:27:06.680]  it moves you know that's a suckers play the thing to do is just a steadily accumulated position
[02:27:06.680 --> 02:27:12.280]  every month every quarter just keep accumulating if you just follow that simple strategy for the last
[02:27:12.280 --> 02:27:17.640]  eight years you would have the best performing asset by by a factor of several hundred percent
[02:27:17.640 --> 02:27:22.920]  over almost every other asset out there it's now right at four times uh what it was but again the
[02:27:22.920 --> 02:27:28.120]  yuppies don't don't get involved because they're so smart just have a steady accumulation pattern
[02:27:28.120 --> 02:27:33.720]  and let the market work for you don't look work for the market you just you do your study accumulation
[02:27:33.720 --> 02:27:39.320]  let this thing play out and you'll see where it's going don't try to double guess it or out guess it
[02:27:39.320 --> 02:27:46.600]  or trade it let's shift gears now talk about gulag uh they they want automatic transfer in the us in
[02:27:46.600 --> 02:27:51.240]  europe they're tracking everything we do in our bank accounts now the british government and they
[02:27:51.240 --> 02:27:56.760]  wanted a vat increase they got it now they're saying everyone's paycheck will go digitally the
[02:27:56.760 --> 02:28:02.120]  government then they'll give you what they think this is actually quoted you deserve so they can
[02:28:02.120 --> 02:28:08.840]  just raise taxes out of nowhere i mean what will the brits not put up with british government to
[02:28:08.840 --> 02:28:14.600]  seize all paychecks that is clearly a poor tend for the rest of the world your max kaiser your take
[02:28:14.600 --> 02:28:18.920]  on that sure well that's the gulag part of the equation and don't forget the casino part of
[02:28:18.920 --> 02:28:24.200]  the equation okay but the clearly the gulag is alive and well in britain and the government
[02:28:24.200 --> 02:28:30.120]  going through this phase of uh taking your pay and then allocating your pay is a step toward the
[02:28:30.120 --> 02:28:36.920]  pure command and control uh economy and where Hugo Chavez didn't even scowling didn't even do that
[02:28:37.800 --> 02:28:43.880]  they they're very frightened because the banks are still going to announce this should tell you
[02:28:43.880 --> 02:28:50.040]  that the banks are still going to announce massive write down in the next six to twelve months the
[02:28:50.040 --> 02:28:55.800]  biggest banks in the world are obviously about to say that they have another 15 to 20 trillion
[02:28:55.800 --> 02:29:01.560]  dollars in bad debt so they not only need your pension fund they now need your entire paycheck
[02:29:01.560 --> 02:29:06.600]  if you don't like it a swat team will drop by right so that that's why the uk government is
[02:29:06.600 --> 02:29:11.080]  telegraphing this fact in other words they're saying well before we in that the banks announced
[02:29:11.080 --> 02:29:15.880]  this 15 trillion dollar loss we better announce that we're going to confiscate your pay and then
[02:29:15.880 --> 02:29:21.640]  allocate your pay first uh this way it'll take the sting out of having lost the entire net worth
[02:29:21.640 --> 02:29:27.000]  in your economy and then they could turn those giant pools into derivatives again of course well
[02:29:27.000 --> 02:29:32.200]  that's the play to explain it explain it to us when we come back max this is key uh because yeah
[02:29:32.200 --> 02:29:36.520]  we haven't seen the other shoe drop yet and don't worry the federal reserve will get more power bank
[02:29:36.520 --> 02:29:40.600]  of england will get more power we can give them everything that if we don't like it the swat
[02:29:40.600 --> 02:29:45.240]  team will drop by this is called living as slaves we'll be right back with max keiser stay with us
[02:29:45.240 --> 02:29:57.960]  we're on the march the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network

[02:36:18.120 --> 02:36:23.800]  were getting into the next big shoot a drop the government's seizing the pension funds the bank
[02:36:23.800 --> 02:36:29.000]  accounts everyone's paychecks giving you a small portion back they're now saying in the us they may
[02:36:29.000 --> 02:36:33.880]  do this did you i want you to finish up on that the next shoot a drop but then i know you saw a
[02:36:33.880 --> 02:36:39.240]  month ago and then last week you had to see it bloomberg and i kept getting calls years ago about
[02:36:39.240 --> 02:36:43.400]  this and i never checked into it because i couldn't believe it see i've just come to the point now i
[02:36:43.400 --> 02:36:48.200]  know it's all true and worse than i can imagine and if i can imagine it i can google it and there's
[02:36:48.200 --> 02:36:52.360]  the government promoting it but saying it's good i mean it's just anything you can imagine they're
[02:36:52.360 --> 02:36:58.840]  doing it and more and bloomberg reported and the articles are weird it's got the government saying
[02:36:58.840 --> 02:37:06.360]  well we change the rules secretly so we're allowed to six million veterans as they die from korea well
[02:37:06.360 --> 02:37:13.000]  world war two some of them are still alive great folks korea vietnam desert one the new wars that
[02:37:13.000 --> 02:37:19.560]  they take their insurance death benefits that they've been paying for and just keep it and the media
[02:37:19.560 --> 02:37:24.120]  says this is good this is wholesome and they're saying they're doing it to shore up bad banks
[02:37:24.120 --> 02:37:28.200]  and they're also reporting that they're taking pension fund money and investing it in failed banks
[02:37:28.200 --> 02:37:33.400]  i mean is there no end i mean we have to like slit our wrist and pour the blood into bernacky's
[02:37:33.400 --> 02:37:38.760]  mouth and then that's not enough i mean please continue max i mean where is this going because
[02:37:38.760 --> 02:37:43.160]  this is even worse than i thought it could be i mean the there's no end to their rapine
[02:37:43.160 --> 02:37:50.760]  well again that's the gulag part of the equation and soldiers not it's not enough that they die
[02:37:50.760 --> 02:37:55.960]  fighting stupid wars pointless wars but the death benefits go to the insurance company
[02:37:55.960 --> 02:38:02.680]  so they really it's a slap in the face to the non-mercenary soldiers who are in the field dying
[02:38:02.680 --> 02:38:08.120]  for a pointless this uh you know blood for oil as toly blare admitted now this new book is
[02:38:08.120 --> 02:38:12.760]  autobiography says yeah the war was for oil and i don't care because you can't touch me i'm part of
[02:38:12.760 --> 02:38:17.880]  the new world order so good go pound cent so it's a real slap in the face of the u.s. servicemen i
[02:38:17.880 --> 02:38:22.600]  don't know why they serve a day more uh dealing in any of these wars is a complete waste but on
[02:38:22.600 --> 02:38:27.560]  the casino because the government made the deal max the government came and said this is good rob
[02:38:27.560 --> 02:38:33.240]  them and then they said absolutely i mean that just shows i'm sorry go ahead yeah well that's on
[02:38:33.240 --> 02:38:38.040]  the gulag side so i mean throughout history and that's been a trick government's abuse to entice
[02:38:38.040 --> 02:38:44.520]  young men to go die for oil companies or the the oligarchy that's no big surprise there but what's
[02:38:44.520 --> 02:38:49.240]  fascinating to me is on the casino side of the casino gulag now i've talked about farmville
[02:38:49.240 --> 02:38:55.240]  and uh before in this virtual currency zinga there's a story out last week where people would
[02:38:55.240 --> 02:39:01.160]  become addicted to farmville are buying the virtual currency for five hundred dollars in the u.s.
[02:39:01.160 --> 02:39:07.960]  dollars cash to finance their addiction so here's max and these other games people pay thousands of
[02:39:07.960 --> 02:39:13.880]  dollars for imaginary Lamborghinis and then they go to real parties and get girlfriends because of
[02:39:13.880 --> 02:39:21.160]  their imaginary crud well yeah but there's the attic what it leads to the heroin addict or a
[02:39:21.160 --> 02:39:25.960]  gambling aolic addict or a online game addict they're spending their stealing money they're
[02:39:25.960 --> 02:39:31.720]  stealing money and they're spending five hundred dollars a pop to get a black market virtual currency
[02:39:31.720 --> 02:39:36.600]  hit from a company called zinga and zinga is not publishing these numbers but this is the primary
[02:39:36.600 --> 02:39:42.840]  source of their profits is by feeding the virtual currency addicts who then go into these games to
[02:39:42.840 --> 02:39:48.840]  impress people by because they're accumulating as you say virtual Lamborghinis or virtual property
[02:39:48.840 --> 02:39:55.080]  playing virtual farm so there's a whole that that's the casino part of the casino gulag they throw
[02:39:55.080 --> 02:40:00.680]  you in the gulag but they give you you know virtual currencies and then you play virtual games all day
[02:40:00.680 --> 02:40:05.720]  in the hopes that you can win you know a few points here and a few points there and it keeps you
[02:40:05.720 --> 02:40:12.920]  distracted and tied into this casino gulag and this is the this is the total soup to nuts 360
[02:40:12.920 --> 02:40:18.520]  degree occupation of your mind as you would say there's a war on for your mind this is how it's
[02:40:18.520 --> 02:40:25.880]  being done all the time using virtual currencies online games farmville facebook and it's happening
[02:40:25.880 --> 02:40:31.400]  in real time I always think their enslavement is cute and like their little goodie and those of us
[02:40:31.400 --> 02:40:36.760]  that criticize it we're just not in on the trendiness max well i sent you that video this guy who is
[02:40:36.760 --> 02:40:43.480]  promoting the fact that in the future everything will have a camera a online wireless connection
[02:40:43.480 --> 02:40:47.960]  and a database connection so you every time you brush your teeth you'll get a credit from the
[02:40:47.960 --> 02:40:53.560]  toothpaste company every time you eat your and i told you last time about those drugs when you the
[02:40:53.560 --> 02:41:00.440]  drugs wear off in your blood it sends a chemical reaction to a patch on your skin which then sends
[02:41:00.440 --> 02:41:05.000]  a text message to your phone that you should take another no they've already got pills that
[02:41:05.000 --> 02:41:11.720]  have a wireless system in it and and and and again they're saying if you want a job you're
[02:41:11.720 --> 02:41:16.280]  going to have to put up with this surveillance i mean they're they're hardwiring a new environment
[02:41:16.280 --> 02:41:22.680]  where to survive we literally are merged with a matrix well my i here i'll make the following
[02:41:22.680 --> 02:41:27.880]  prediction they'll figure out how to put a phone line through an umbilical cord to a fetus and get
[02:41:27.880 --> 02:41:33.640]  fetuses to rack up virtual death to the point where they bought themselves to escape prenatal
[02:41:33.640 --> 02:41:41.240]  bankruptcy well actually i remember 10 years ago the state of origan started uh uh pre-drugging
[02:41:41.240 --> 02:41:46.920]  children in utero and then at birth putting them on probation and now england does that the babies
[02:41:46.920 --> 02:41:51.480]  it was at age two now at birth if their parents were ever involved in any crimes they then say
[02:41:51.480 --> 02:41:58.760]  genetically they're criminals and so yes this is the new system so you know i'd like to see somebody
[02:41:58.760 --> 02:42:04.600]  come out against this because i'm against the casino gulag and i'm for um the rights of the
[02:42:04.600 --> 02:42:11.240]  unborn not to indent themselves to the point of aborting themselves to avoid a credit card default
[02:42:11.240 --> 02:42:17.080]  that the visa or the master chart there'll be a monetized mass fetal opt out uh fund that they'll
[02:42:17.080 --> 02:42:22.440]  monetize the derivatives to pay for it of course government stacks will come up with a fetal pre-abortion
[02:42:22.440 --> 02:42:26.600]  collateralized debt obligation that they'll sell the city bank and then they'll sell it onto some
[02:42:26.600 --> 02:42:32.440]  by the way we're not joking i saw writing you did eight years ago where you predicted they would
[02:42:32.440 --> 02:42:37.720]  start betting on terror attacks then they use your technology to come out with the virtual
[02:42:37.720 --> 02:42:43.960]  terror attack to actually make money off the terror attacks the policy analysis marked at p a m john
[02:42:43.960 --> 02:42:50.520]  poindexter uh the department of defense came out with that market they tried to launch it publicly
[02:42:50.520 --> 02:42:55.960]  uh they shut it down the outrage was uh in the press they still run it behind the scenes they try
[02:42:55.960 --> 02:43:01.640]  to make a market and terror attacks and of course insider trading is right on wall street people
[02:43:01.640 --> 02:43:06.200]  make money by trading an inside information so too in the terror market when you see a big terror
[02:43:06.200 --> 02:43:10.840]  event it's because the insiders are trading on inside information to make a killing on the offline
[02:43:10.840 --> 02:43:15.320]  terror futures market of course well right when they were about to do the global rollout of naked
[02:43:15.320 --> 02:43:20.040]  body scanners the state department was ordered by the cia on record to put the underwear bomber on
[02:43:20.040 --> 02:43:25.480]  the plane and he was protected and that was confirmed so that was the little fear rollout i mean
[02:43:25.480 --> 02:43:31.640]  it's all staged well the theology that guides it is market fundamentalism they believe that the
[02:43:31.640 --> 02:43:37.720]  market is their god the market is always right and it's america's fundamentalist ideology it
[02:43:37.720 --> 02:43:43.320]  it says dangerous as any islamic fundamental extremism it's american market fundamentalist
[02:43:43.320 --> 02:43:49.400]  extremism okay let's we're almost out of time and i promised it sorry go ahead i'm saying it guides
[02:43:49.400 --> 02:43:56.520]  obama geysers somers and all and bernanke they're all market extremist fundamentalist market uh
[02:43:56.520 --> 02:44:02.360]  worshiping the zealots and ideolog all right let's play this clip from a video game conference
[02:44:02.360 --> 02:44:07.400]  where they're now talking about exactly what you predicted here it is there's everywhere detecting
[02:44:07.400 --> 02:44:14.520]  so many things in your life and these things are going to be able to be used for for gameplay so
[02:44:16.840 --> 02:44:22.040]  we're moving on a road towards disposable technology if anyone here ever bought a furby
[02:44:22.840 --> 02:44:28.200]  right the furby costs like 20 30 dollars it has more technology in it than they use to put a man on
[02:44:28.200 --> 02:44:32.840]  the moon and many people have now thrown out their furbies because it's like it's kind of dumb and
[02:44:32.840 --> 02:44:37.720]  they throw it out it's disposable technology we're before too long going to get to the point where
[02:44:37.720 --> 02:44:45.320]  every soda can every cereal box is going to be able to have a cpu a screen and a camera on board it
[02:44:45.320 --> 02:44:51.800]  and a wi-fi connector so that it can be connected to the internet and what will that world be like
[02:44:52.680 --> 02:44:58.440]  well i think it'll be like this you'll get up in the morning to brush your teeth and the toothbrush
[02:44:58.440 --> 02:45:04.600]  can sense that you're brushing your teeth and so hey good job for you 10 points for brushing your
[02:45:04.600 --> 02:45:09.480]  teeth all right stop there how long and you're supposed to go so it's totally pavlovian but this
[02:45:09.480 --> 02:45:15.960]  is actually their plan with the rfid california is coming out with license plates uh that put
[02:45:15.960 --> 02:45:21.960]  advertisements on it for the state but also when you're good and pay your carbon taxes trees will
[02:45:21.960 --> 02:45:27.480]  then grow and show that you're a good person so the mal gangs that they're now setting up won't
[02:45:27.480 --> 02:45:35.560]  pickaxe you in the parking lot uh max keiser well they expositioned as a game which the word game
[02:45:35.560 --> 02:45:41.640]  sounds innocuous and innocent and just a game and uh this is how they're selling it to people
[02:45:41.640 --> 02:45:46.040]  people buy they buy into farmville because it's an innocent game they don't realize that it's a way
[02:45:46.040 --> 02:45:51.960]  to reduce the average wage in america from the minimum wage down to slave wage you know people
[02:45:51.960 --> 02:45:57.240]  people spend 15 16 hours a day on farmville and at the end of the day they get a free slice of cheese
[02:45:57.240 --> 02:46:01.960]  at 7 11 they exchange their credits for cheese and they they're happy about it because they think
[02:46:01.960 --> 02:46:06.920]  that they're winning the game they don't wreck they don't reconcile that they generated tens of
[02:46:06.920 --> 02:46:12.200]  dollars worth of advertising revenue for facebook that they're working for facebook but it's slave
[02:46:12.200 --> 02:46:17.080]  wages they don't make that calculation the same way people never understood that it's stylish max
[02:46:18.120 --> 02:46:23.640]  people never understood when they shop at walmart every 20 cents they save on some gadgets
[02:46:23.640 --> 02:46:29.400]  is made in china they lose 40 cents in wages they never made a connection they wonder why they have
[02:46:29.400 --> 02:46:34.120]  no job why they're why they're stand-up living is so let's shift gears here i mean you're spot on
[02:46:34.120 --> 02:46:39.480]  about every major issue but i saw a clip of you on your i believe it was your rt show attacking
[02:46:39.480 --> 02:46:45.480]  people as idiots who don't believe in man-made global warming and you're doing this at a time
[02:46:45.480 --> 02:46:50.760]  when it's but it's come out that they lied about all the numbers that they're doing it to get a
[02:46:50.760 --> 02:46:55.560]  carbon tax i know you're against the carbon tax but i mean where do you stand on this i mean we
[02:46:55.560 --> 02:47:01.160]  give al gore and george sorrell's money and he and they save us right as you say carbon tax and
[02:47:01.160 --> 02:47:08.840]  and carbon trading are things that are scam for sure but it all started back in 2000
[02:47:09.480 --> 02:47:15.320]  the man made global warming climate change when i noticed that the same guys who were
[02:47:15.320 --> 02:47:23.640]  were very active in the tobacco causes cancer denial business were being hired by exxon
[02:47:23.640 --> 02:47:30.600]  mobile chevron now wait a minute the big oil companies are all behind the carbon tax i'm sorry
[02:47:30.600 --> 02:47:35.160]  the big oil companies are the ones pushing all the carbon taxes we're not talking about carbon
[02:47:35.160 --> 02:47:40.920]  taxes i'm talking about man-made global warming and climate change i'm saying that back in the
[02:47:40.920 --> 02:47:47.080]  2000 era back in 2000 i noticed that the same guys who were hired by the tobacco lobby were
[02:47:47.080 --> 02:47:53.240]  being hired by the oil industry to promote this idea that uh there's no such thing as man-made
[02:47:53.240 --> 02:47:57.880]  global warming and climate change so i started asking questions and i started writing about this
[02:47:57.880 --> 02:48:03.880]  because i said these guys are no good and i don't like exxon i don't like bp i don't like chevron
[02:48:03.880 --> 02:48:07.800]  i'm never going to be on the same side well the toxic waste that's the derivative of oil is
[02:48:07.800 --> 02:48:12.280]  certainly bad we should go to cleaner energies but giving the big mega banks control over the
[02:48:12.280 --> 02:48:16.760]  economy that's the wrong direction that that that absolutely but that doesn't change this
[02:48:16.760 --> 02:48:22.520]  man-made global warming climate change idea i mean carbon trading and carbon taxes are bad we
[02:48:22.520 --> 02:48:28.040]  agree but what i'm saying is i noticed the same guys who are putting out the line that cigarette
[02:48:28.040 --> 02:48:35.320]  smoking does not cause cancer we're being hired by the oil industry now exxon mobile bp chevron
[02:48:35.320 --> 02:48:41.880]  those guys stink i'm at war with those guys they totally wrote let me tell you i'm winning battles
[02:48:41.880 --> 02:48:48.280]  in this war because he had guys like steve alloy and tom burrell who started a free action uh enterprise
[02:48:48.280 --> 02:48:54.680]  fund against my karma banks fund okay those guys were exposed those guys are now out of business
[02:48:54.680 --> 02:48:59.400]  then you had a guy named tom dewey who wrote a slander piece against me in the canadian press
[02:48:59.400 --> 02:49:03.720]  you don't hear about him anymore either because i did what i had to do to put tom dewey out of
[02:49:03.720 --> 02:49:09.480]  business okay talk about the cancer exchange by the way canter exchange does carbon trading they do
[02:49:09.480 --> 02:49:14.360]  box up a futures contract what happened to canter exchange it was put completely out of business
[02:49:14.360 --> 02:49:18.920]  they fired everybody in that office why because i did what i had to do because i'm at war with
[02:49:18.920 --> 02:49:26.280]  those guys well i'm trying to admit max i screw with them i'm a little i'm a little ignorant about
[02:49:26.840 --> 02:49:32.520]  all the names and things you're talking about all i can tell you is the environmental groups
[02:49:32.520 --> 02:49:37.640]  aren't concerned about genetic engineering open air testing of all this stuff things that i'm
[02:49:37.640 --> 02:49:42.360]  really concerned about that i know couldn't danger the planet and i know that carbon dioxide is what
[02:49:42.360 --> 02:49:48.760]  plants breathe and so all i'm saying is out of this whole movement is coming taxes that have
[02:49:48.760 --> 02:49:54.840]  nothing and then i see bp and others bankrolling it and i mean i just so i'm i'm confused because
[02:49:54.840 --> 02:50:00.200]  the big oil companies i see in magazine ads and on tv they're out promoting all this
[02:50:00.200 --> 02:50:07.800]  yes excellent bp chevron they're promoting this idea no such thing man made climate change global
[02:50:07.800 --> 02:50:13.560]  warming okay this is what i am fighting them you're saying bp isn't promoting man made global
[02:50:13.560 --> 02:50:19.480]  climate change garbage okay those guys i'm at war with those guys and i'm taking scouts
[02:50:19.480 --> 02:50:24.360]  and i'm winning against those guys okay because i know where they breathe and i'm putting stuff
[02:50:24.360 --> 02:50:29.160]  out there in the press you don't hear about these guys anymore steve mulloy was a major lobbyist
[02:50:29.160 --> 02:50:34.200]  in washington dc he started an entire fund the free enterprise action fund it's completely gone
[02:50:34.200 --> 02:50:39.480]  because i totally exposed him uh he talked about the policy analysis market john pointexters
[02:50:39.480 --> 02:50:46.120]  terror futures market how come that was taken down i invented technology it's gone care exchange
[02:50:46.120 --> 02:50:51.880]  irrefutably that's not being in the marketplace at this point they also want to do carbon trading
[02:50:51.880 --> 02:50:56.440]  are they doing carbon trading no because they're taking them down well that's because the public

[02:57:09.640 --> 02:57:13.480]  want to end on an argumentative note here because i really agree with the only economy and some of
[02:57:13.480 --> 02:57:18.120]  things but but but more and more they're talking about green fascism and how they do just want to
[02:57:18.120 --> 02:57:23.080]  kill everybody do you think we should uh you think there's too many people max there's gonna be
[02:57:23.080 --> 02:57:28.600]  intergenerational problem i mean the the welfare because there's no money to pay the welfare and
