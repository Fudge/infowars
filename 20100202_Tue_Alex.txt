[00:00.000 --> 00:10.240]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[00:10.240 --> 00:11.740]  You want answers?
[00:11.740 --> 00:13.440]  Well, so does he.
[00:13.440 --> 00:17.600]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:17.600 --> 00:35.360]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:35.360 --> 00:39.080]  Welcome ladies and gentlemen, welcome and thank you so much for joining us.
[00:39.080 --> 00:46.800]  We are live, the second day of February 2010 on this Tuesday edition.
[00:46.800 --> 00:51.880]  It is tomorrow's show that we have several surprise guests on.
[00:51.880 --> 00:54.760]  I will just leave it at that.
[00:54.760 --> 00:58.080]  My producers explained to me at the end of the show that I had misspoken saying today
[00:58.080 --> 01:00.560]  was the day we had some surprise guests.
[01:00.560 --> 01:04.000]  It is tomorrow.
[01:04.000 --> 01:08.880]  But coming up, Mike Rivera, what really happened with his once a month visit with us, we'll
[01:08.880 --> 01:13.640]  be popping in on a host of issues, we'll be going live at PrisonPlanet.tv on the second,
[01:13.640 --> 01:21.840]  third and fourth hour simulcasting the radio show in living color for TV viewers at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:21.840 --> 01:25.400]  And then we have John Heming.
[01:25.400 --> 01:32.880]  He is the leader of the Liberal Democrats party.
[01:32.880 --> 01:35.480]  And he will be joining us from the UK.
[01:35.480 --> 01:42.320]  He's been speaking out against the fact that they're taking people's children now in England.
[01:42.320 --> 01:48.040]  The CPS is for low IQs or for learning disabilities.
[01:48.040 --> 01:52.600]  And I've seen the mother on television, she's well spoken and they say, sorry, no judge,
[01:52.600 --> 01:54.680]  no jury, we just take your child.
[01:54.680 --> 01:58.720]  They then fled to Ireland and Ireland under the EU treaty took the children.
[01:58.720 --> 02:03.200]  Mother not clever enough to raise child has babies snatched by social workers.
[02:03.200 --> 02:09.800]  After running away to Ireland to give birth, John Heming, who's standing up for them will
[02:09.800 --> 02:15.760]  be joining us coming up later in the broadcast as well.
[02:15.760 --> 02:23.280]  After Mike Rivera comes on with us chronicling all of the most important news that we're
[02:23.280 --> 02:26.800]  tracking here.
[02:26.800 --> 02:33.840]  The news of Australia news.com.au reports South Australian government gags internet
[02:33.840 --> 02:44.120]  debate, gags criticism of government ministers, shuts down the web, joining China as a ultra
[02:44.120 --> 02:48.920]  hardcore censors and tyrants.
[02:48.920 --> 02:55.440]  And that dovetails now with a Newsmax article that is basically parroting what we broke
[02:55.440 --> 03:02.520]  down in yesterday's article about the United Nations announcing they want an end to free
[03:02.520 --> 03:08.160]  speech basically on the internet and to restrict what people can say and do and all these new
[03:08.160 --> 03:14.480]  taxes headline enemies of free speech call for internet licensing death of the web moves
[03:14.480 --> 03:18.160]  closer as UN calls for policing cyberspace.
[03:18.160 --> 03:22.040]  So I want to break that down today.
[03:22.040 --> 03:31.080]  Also on the naked body scanner front, air passengers who refuse a full body scan to be barred from
[03:31.080 --> 03:36.320]  their flights, that's in the UK, they're talking about that here in the United States.
[03:36.320 --> 03:42.440]  And then the Toronto Star has the disgusting headline shut up and get scanned already.
[03:42.440 --> 03:46.040]  Another report airline passengers have no right to refuse naked body scanners.
[03:46.040 --> 03:54.960]  That's the Guardian Manchester airport trials naked image security scans.
[03:54.960 --> 04:03.800]  And the good news here Durham T's Valley airport refuses to commit to controversial body scanners.
[04:03.800 --> 04:05.960]  So we'll be going over all of that today.
[04:05.960 --> 04:12.720]  If they can set the precedent for this, they can get away with almost anything.
[04:12.720 --> 04:16.360]  And there's a new article at prisonplanet.com.
[04:16.360 --> 04:26.080]  By Paul Joseph Watson, Obama pledges another $215 million on top of the billion for virtual
[04:26.080 --> 04:33.240]  strip search scanners and says they're going in nationwide.
[04:33.240 --> 04:35.920]  So that is coming up.
[04:35.920 --> 04:40.200]  Also we're going to look at Obama's new budget.
[04:40.200 --> 04:44.000]  What's happening on the military front.
[04:44.000 --> 04:48.160]  So the bankers calling for a global government, they will administer in the name of taxing
[04:48.160 --> 04:55.840]  themselves a complete and total bait and switch will be right back after this quick
[04:55.840 --> 04:56.840]  break.
[04:56.840 --> 04:57.840]  Also an early draft.
[04:57.840 --> 05:01.200]  The Constitution has been found in Philadelphia.
[05:01.200 --> 05:04.240]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[05:04.240 --> 05:08.600]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition
[05:08.600 --> 05:09.600]  do you want?
[05:09.600 --> 05:13.960]  My answer would be all I can get in the battle for freedom and the lives of your love.
[05:13.960 --> 05:16.640]  Food is your only ammunition.
[05:16.640 --> 05:17.880]  How much do you want?
[05:17.880 --> 05:18.960]  When do you want it?
[05:18.960 --> 05:20.920]  Now or after the battle starts.
[05:20.920 --> 05:22.040]  When will you need it?
[05:22.040 --> 05:24.160]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[05:24.160 --> 05:25.520]  Will there be any food?
[05:25.520 --> 05:26.960]  Will it make your children sick?
[05:26.960 --> 05:31.120]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center
[05:31.120 --> 05:32.280]  and be immunized?
[05:32.280 --> 05:36.040]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[05:36.040 --> 05:39.640]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[05:39.640 --> 05:40.880]  How much will you need?
[05:40.880 --> 05:41.880]  We don't know.
[05:41.880 --> 05:42.880]  How much do you want?
[05:42.880 --> 05:43.880]  All you can get.
[05:43.880 --> 05:44.880]  This is Alex Jones.
[05:44.880 --> 05:47.960]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[05:47.960 --> 05:55.440]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[05:55.440 --> 05:59.440]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[05:59.440 --> 06:06.840]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[06:06.840 --> 06:09.960]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[06:09.960 --> 06:14.360]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans
[06:14.360 --> 06:15.360]  at home.
[06:15.360 --> 06:20.000]  We've turned a tremendous influence on our president in Congress, and they really are
[06:20.000 --> 06:21.000]  calling the shots.
[06:21.000 --> 06:26.320]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[06:26.320 --> 06:31.800]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel
[06:31.800 --> 06:36.480]  held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[06:36.480 --> 06:38.880]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, and Arsonists.
[06:38.880 --> 06:43.040]  They're asking for more matches, and the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[06:43.040 --> 06:48.400]  Today, it seems like nobody does care, and right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen
[06:48.400 --> 06:50.240]  a fall of the Republic.
[06:50.240 --> 06:54.760]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com.
[06:54.760 --> 06:59.960]  We're watching online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[06:59.960 --> 07:03.040]  Hi, neighbor.
[07:03.040 --> 07:06.560]  They say the road to hell is paved with good intentions.
[07:06.560 --> 07:09.840]  Normally we'd never intend to procrastinate getting our own food supply until there was
[07:09.840 --> 07:11.640]  none left at any price.
[07:11.640 --> 07:15.360]  We would intend to have plenty of food so the relief organizations could care for those
[07:15.360 --> 07:17.360]  unable to care for themselves.
[07:17.360 --> 07:21.560]  We would intend not to be standing in the bread line with the ignorant and the foolish
[07:21.560 --> 07:24.960]  who pretend the facts of food disappearance are untrue.
[07:24.960 --> 07:30.680]  If the experience of the Katrina disaster is evidence, the bread line may have no bread.
[07:30.680 --> 07:35.040]  Just like the good intentions on the road to that unheavenly place, the good intentions
[07:35.040 --> 07:38.400]  alone to get a supply of food will not feed us.
[07:38.400 --> 07:43.320]  Only getting our food supply immediately will make us independent and fearless for the future.
[07:43.320 --> 07:46.800]  Call 800-409-5633.
[07:46.800 --> 07:52.920]  800-409-5633 on the web, efoodsdirect.com.
[07:52.920 --> 07:55.000]  Who am I?
[07:55.000 --> 08:02.000]  Some of who cares.
[08:02.000 --> 08:17.760]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[08:17.760 --> 08:24.720]  I have multiple mainstream news articles in UK newspapers where they're saying, stupid
[08:24.720 --> 08:30.840]  parents need to be sterilized, poor parents need to be sterilized, and all over the United
[08:30.840 --> 08:35.600]  Kingdom they are just taking people's children because they're poor, or because they quote
[08:35.600 --> 08:38.360]  have a learning disability.
[08:38.360 --> 08:43.240]  You see, they advertise globally, oh get a learning disability, it's the stylish cool
[08:43.240 --> 08:44.240]  thing.
[08:44.240 --> 08:49.160]  You know, you have trouble reading, you have trouble at math, something's wrong with you.
[08:49.160 --> 08:56.440]  We've got medication for you, and they hand out these labels, and then you're 20 years
[08:56.440 --> 09:00.320]  old and you have a child and the CPS comes and takes them.
[09:00.320 --> 09:06.200]  This is the same model, the same system, this is global coordination from Australia to the
[09:06.200 --> 09:13.560]  United States, from Canada to England, from Germany to Argentina, the same systems are
[09:13.560 --> 09:14.560]  being employed.
[09:14.560 --> 09:19.520]  The big central banks come in and lobby your governments with legislation.
[09:19.520 --> 09:24.200]  They write, and their think tanks, like the Council on Fine Relations write, and then
[09:24.200 --> 09:28.040]  they are passed as whole law.
[09:28.040 --> 09:34.000]  The CFR wrote the SPP agreement, the Council on Foreign Relations wrote the blanket illegal
[09:34.000 --> 09:39.680]  alien amnesty legislation, they write the Homeland Security legislation, they write
[09:39.680 --> 09:45.840]  the anti-gun legislation, they publicly write it, put it in white papers, and on average
[09:45.840 --> 09:51.080]  three years later it's law.
[09:51.080 --> 09:53.840]  That's why Hillary Clinton and others have gone and given speeches there in the last
[09:53.840 --> 09:58.240]  year and said, I love coming here and getting my orders from you, and everyone laughs, but
[09:58.240 --> 10:03.120]  it's not a joke, it's in your face, it's like Kramer.
[10:03.120 --> 10:12.560]  We played part of the clip last week, I want to play more of it today, but I want to play
[10:12.560 --> 10:19.000]  more of Kramer coming up later in the hour because, you know, he says the banker bailout
[10:19.000 --> 10:25.080]  is good, he says the banker bailout is wonderful, and that the bankers are saving us, and then
[10:25.080 --> 10:34.240]  he says, yes, the Bavarian Illuminati, the New World Order, it's all a big joke to him.
[10:34.240 --> 10:38.960]  So out of one side of their mouth they're denying any of this exist, and then out of
[10:38.960 --> 10:42.960]  the other side of their mouth they're openly announcing it and taunting us and telling
[10:42.960 --> 10:51.400]  us how Bernanke and Geithner are saving us, how great they are, and they count on people
[10:51.400 --> 10:57.760]  being so mentally shallow that, well, a Bernanke's Time Magazine man of the year, and Kramer
[10:57.760 --> 11:04.040]  saying Geithner's saving us, I mean it must be a good thing, and he describes how Paulson
[11:04.040 --> 11:21.120]  got on his knees to Congress and begged them to pass the TARP legislation.
[11:21.120 --> 11:27.400]  He didn't get on his knees, he told them martial law will be declared, and Aaron Dykes last
[11:27.400 --> 11:32.920]  night at infowars.com wrote an article detailing this, it's got Kramer and the word Illuminati
[11:32.920 --> 11:35.760]  in the headline, I've got it here on the stack, but if you want to go find it, it's
[11:35.760 --> 11:42.520]  already scrolled off the front page and into the featured news archive, that's how much
[11:42.520 --> 11:50.960]  news and information gets posted on the site, in fact, here it is, it's about to scroll
[11:50.960 --> 12:00.600]  off, it's still on the front page, Kramer pleads, trust Bernanke, the Bavarian Illuminati,
[12:00.600 --> 12:07.880]  the Trilateral Commission, and the Queen are not all bad, but I want to dovetail that with
[12:07.880 --> 12:13.880]  another MSNBC clip that I never really got to from last week where one of the other
[12:13.880 --> 12:23.920]  hosts tells the truth and says it's really 23.7 trillion they've stolen, now that number
[12:23.920 --> 12:33.280]  is from October of last year, so it's three, four months old, so the latest Bloomberg breakdown
[12:33.280 --> 12:40.640]  is 28 plus trillion, and I get so many questions about this, people go, but they keep saying
[12:40.640 --> 12:46.600]  700 billion, well number one, they have gone back repeatedly in a rotating, and that was
[12:46.600 --> 12:51.680]  in congressional testimony a year ago, they do go get that 700 billion over and over and
[12:51.680 --> 12:57.920]  over again, it's rotating, but that's separate, and then they do pay a lot of that back, the
[12:57.920 --> 13:03.040]  banks get it, they leverage it, 10 to 1 on average just through fractional reserve banking,
[13:03.040 --> 13:07.440]  not even the derivatives and currency trade manipulations they're playing, it's really
[13:07.440 --> 13:12.880]  almost to infinity, and then yeah, a year later they pay it back, but that 700 billion
[13:12.880 --> 13:18.200]  is the red herring, and I just keep noticing emails and calls I get about this, but saying
[13:18.200 --> 13:25.000]  with this 700 billion, no, it's 23.7 trillion according to Congress in the last hearings
[13:25.000 --> 13:32.160]  they had in October, but Bloomberg says an additional, this was a month ago, four plus
[13:32.160 --> 13:44.280]  trill was at 4.4 trill, so that's $28 trillion, right at $28 trillion, meanwhile, and again
[13:44.280 --> 13:48.120]  that's coming up at the bottom of the hour, I'm going to break that all down, meanwhile
[13:48.120 --> 13:55.800]  Obama, the big peacenik has brought forward the biggest defense budget in history, now
[13:55.800 --> 14:02.040]  he already broke the previous record of Bush in 2009, now he's brought forward a budget
[14:02.040 --> 14:09.200]  even bigger, and he seeks more money for nuclear weapons, more nuclear weapons, now whether
[14:09.200 --> 14:14.480]  you're for more nukes or not, this guy's expanding wars, expanding the Patriot Act,
[14:14.480 --> 14:21.480]  expanding secret arrest, rendition, torture, not a word out of the Democrats, not a word
[14:21.480 --> 14:27.520]  out of all the peaceniks in the newspapers and on TV who were so upset about this, and
[14:27.520 --> 14:32.560]  it's going to be the same thing when Republicans get into office, you watch, they're suddenly
[14:32.560 --> 14:36.480]  not going to be worried about the NAFTA superhighways, they're certainly not going to be worried
[14:36.480 --> 14:41.160]  about all these Zars and restrictions on free speech, they're certainly not going to be
[14:41.160 --> 14:46.320]  so worried about cap and trade, they're not going to be as worried about government takeover
[14:46.320 --> 14:53.480]  of healthcare, because they're the establishment, unless we get a bunch of Debra Medina types
[14:53.480 --> 14:59.160]  running for governor in Texas into office, which is starting to happen, people are seeing
[14:59.160 --> 15:05.480]  her success and other success all over the country, and get campaign for liberty type
[15:05.480 --> 15:17.840]  people into place, and if we can do that then we really have a chance to save this country
[15:17.840 --> 15:28.560]  and hence the world, Obama seeks money for nuclear weapons work, yes more money, continuing
[15:28.560 --> 15:36.520]  Obama budget seeks 1.9 trillion tax rise on richest and businesses, which they pass through
[15:36.520 --> 15:42.520]  the general public, they put massive state taxes on oil and gas, and it's just passed
[15:42.520 --> 15:49.400]  on to the consumers, and they put taxes on telecoms, it's just passed on to consumers,
[15:49.400 --> 15:55.520]  but remember Obama's absolute pledge, he wouldn't have signing statements making law at the
[15:55.520 --> 16:01.200]  executive level, tagging things on to bills, and then ordering the bureaucracy to implement
[16:01.200 --> 16:06.560]  it, I mean that's treason, he wasn't going to hire any lobbyists, hire more lobbyists
[16:06.560 --> 16:11.400]  than anybody in history, he was going to make government more transparent than ever, made
[16:11.400 --> 16:15.000]  it more secret than ever, he was going to stop all the warrantless wiretapping of citizens,
[16:15.000 --> 16:21.520]  now he openly expands it, but if you look at him on taxes, his healthcare bills a huge
[16:21.520 --> 16:33.440]  tax on the general public, he said if you make a half million dollars a year as a couple,
[16:33.440 --> 16:37.880]  I'm going to tax you, and we pointed out well that's really $250,000 a year, well now we
[16:37.880 --> 16:45.880]  have his new tax plan he sent to Congress, and it's getting a bunch of new taxes tagged
[16:45.880 --> 16:51.920]  on, will be far worse by the end of it, this is Bloomberg, Obama budget seeks $1.9 trillion
[16:51.920 --> 16:57.160]  tax rise on richest businesses, of course all the big banks are offshore and they don't
[16:57.160 --> 17:02.000]  care, the Obama administration seeks $970 billion tax increase of the next decade on
[17:02.000 --> 17:11.640]  Americans earning more than $200,000 individually, and wants to take in an additional $400 billion
[17:11.640 --> 17:18.840]  for businesses, the administration budget released yesterday would reinstate a 10 year
[17:18.840 --> 17:27.720]  old tax rates of 36% to 39.6% for single Americans earning more than $200,000, so it's gone from
[17:27.720 --> 17:41.440]  $500,000 to couples making $500,000 to individuals earning more than $200,000, an absolute lie,
[17:41.440 --> 17:49.560]  an absolute fraud in your face from $500,000 to now $200,000, and you better believe that
[17:49.560 --> 17:57.120]  when they're done with all of this, that it's going to be everybody, and all the new environmental
[17:57.120 --> 18:02.920]  taxes and the new EPA taxes that they're doing on all fossil fuels and human activity and
[18:02.920 --> 18:12.760]  home inspections and taxes on all the businesses, and I mean it's just hellish, $200,000 on
[18:12.760 --> 18:20.440]  joint filers, listen to this, so a man and a woman make $200,000, I mean my goodness
[18:20.440 --> 18:27.400]  in New York or Los Angeles or San Francisco, if a husband and wife with a couple children
[18:27.400 --> 18:34.880]  are making $200,000, they're living in a tiny three bedroom apartment and they got one car,
[18:34.880 --> 18:40.280]  I mean do you have any idea how much it costs to live?
[18:40.280 --> 18:46.760]  I mean Austin used to be cheap, now if it's a halfway safe neighborhood, a three bedroom
[18:46.760 --> 18:56.920]  is $500,000 and that's nothing compared to cities that are really expensive.
[18:56.920 --> 19:02.200]  He proposes to eliminate preferences for oil and gas companies, life insurance products,
[19:02.200 --> 19:07.840]  oh yeah, getting rid of your tax exemption, and your home exemption, oh get rid of the
[19:07.840 --> 19:12.360]  home exemption for everybody, oh that's not a tax increase on everybody, executives of
[19:12.360 --> 19:16.400]  investment partnerships and U.S. based companies that operate overseas, and of course they
[19:16.400 --> 19:21.040]  always say that and at the end they won't actually enforce it.
[19:21.040 --> 19:25.280]  This set of tax reforms strikes a balance between targeted tax cuts to spur investments
[19:25.280 --> 19:29.760]  in job growth and innovation here at home, oh yes that will really innovate things, the
[19:29.760 --> 19:34.440]  wet blanket of carbon taxes on everything, middle class tax relief, yes middle class
[19:34.440 --> 19:40.320]  tax relief to make our taxes to more fair, oh really it's the top 5% paying most of the
[19:40.320 --> 19:46.880]  taxes, but it's that $1,000 at the very top that wants to destroy the middle class under
[19:46.880 --> 19:47.880]  them.
[19:47.880 --> 19:53.240]  Of course Tim Geithner made that statement about how this creates tax fairness, this
[19:53.240 --> 19:57.080]  is a guy who doesn't even pay his taxes, he'll be right back with more of their criminal
[19:57.080 --> 20:01.120]  agenda straight ahead.
[20:01.120 --> 20:05.680]  Of the 3 million plus edible food plants that grow on earth, no other single plant can compare
[20:05.680 --> 20:09.840]  with the nutritional value of the powder, seeds and oil of the hemp plant.
[20:09.840 --> 20:15.320]  At hempusa.org we ship worldwide these nutritional products with free shipping to the U.S. and
[20:15.320 --> 20:16.320]  Canada.
[20:16.320 --> 20:21.320]  At hempusa.org we want to educate our listeners that edible hemp is not marijuana and is certified
[20:21.320 --> 20:22.960]  THC free.
[20:22.960 --> 20:26.480]  Our powder is 50% protein and does not contain gluten.
[20:26.480 --> 20:28.840]  Gluten impairs the cells from absorbing nutrients.
[20:28.840 --> 20:33.000]  This nutrient dense food can be stored up to 5 years when vacuum packed and is priced
[20:33.000 --> 20:35.480]  affordably to be used as a storeable food.
[20:35.480 --> 20:38.880]  Hempusa.org is a bulk shipper starting with 5 pounds and up.
[20:38.880 --> 20:45.920]  To allow this food to work for you call 908-691-2608 or go to hempusa.org in order today.
[20:45.920 --> 20:49.180]  The body will react and heal itself given the proper nutrition.
[20:49.180 --> 20:54.120]  This superfood will be your greatest asset so try it today, store it today and change
[20:54.120 --> 20:55.120]  your life.
[20:55.120 --> 21:00.600]  Call 908-691-2608 or order from hempusa.org.
[21:00.600 --> 21:05.360]  Did you know that the dollar has lost 10% of its value against other currencies in the
[21:05.360 --> 21:06.880]  last 90 days?
[21:06.880 --> 21:11.800]  Ever think about how inflation will change your life, your savings, your retirement plans?
[21:11.800 --> 21:16.000]  Remember inflation in Zimbabwe, Argentina, the Weimar Republic?
[21:16.000 --> 21:17.240]  Let's put this another way.
[21:17.240 --> 21:22.760]  Who cares if your investments go up 10% but you lose 40% of your purchasing power?
[21:22.760 --> 21:25.640]  Gold still buys the same amount of stuff it always did.
[21:25.640 --> 21:28.160]  Gold does not require trust in a third party.
[21:28.160 --> 21:31.360]  You can possess it in your hand, you can take it with you.
[21:31.360 --> 21:33.960]  Gold is real money, gold is honest money.
[21:33.960 --> 21:36.680]  My name is Daniel Larson from Midas Resources.
[21:36.680 --> 21:41.320]  To find out how you can protect your savings and roll over your IRA funds into precious
[21:41.320 --> 21:48.920]  metal accounts call me at 800-686-2237 extension 134.
[21:48.920 --> 22:02.320]  That's 800-686-2237 extension 134 800-686-2237 extension 134.
[22:02.320 --> 22:06.040]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[22:06.040 --> 22:09.200]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[22:09.200 --> 22:13.560]  Because we're finishing off this agenda that we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans
[22:13.560 --> 22:14.560]  at home.
[22:14.560 --> 22:19.720]  I have tremendous influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the
[22:19.720 --> 22:20.720]  shots.
[22:20.720 --> 22:25.560]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[22:25.560 --> 22:31.040]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal off-short cartel
[22:31.040 --> 22:35.720]  held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[22:35.720 --> 22:38.120]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists.
[22:38.120 --> 22:42.240]  They're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the check out to?
[22:42.240 --> 22:48.120]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington D.C. we have seen a fall
[22:48.120 --> 22:49.120]  of the Republic.
[22:49.120 --> 22:55.520]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com or watch it online right
[22:55.520 --> 23:00.480]  now in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv.
[23:00.480 --> 23:05.320]  Hounded by debt collectors with phone calls and letters, thinking of calling a debt relief
[23:05.320 --> 23:10.560]  company, don't greedy lawyers and debt companies charge thousands.
[23:10.560 --> 23:14.800]  Why pay when you can get their solution absolutely free?

[23:20.480 --> 23:26.960]  stopping the calls without paying the debt companies, yes free for a very limited time.
[23:26.960 --> 23:27.960]  Here's Herb K.
[23:27.960 --> 23:32.080]  Don't get ripped off by credit repair companies when I can give you the information you need
[23:32.080 --> 23:34.200]  to do it yourself for free.
[23:34.200 --> 23:38.640]  Herb K was right, his free information helped me stop the calls and settle my debt.
[23:38.640 --> 23:40.120]  What have you got to lose?
[23:40.120 --> 23:43.760]  Stop the calls now, get out of debt and have more money.

[23:56.200 --> 24:06.200]  That's 888-352-7726.
[24:06.200 --> 24:35.200]  That's 888-352-7726.
[24:35.200 --> 24:40.720]  Next February 2nd, 2010 on this Tuesday edition, thank you for joining us.
[24:40.720 --> 24:49.200]  We're going to simulcast the 2nd, 3rd and 4th hour live at prisonplanet.tv for members
[24:49.200 --> 24:54.800]  and viewers, for radio listeners that want to go over and see a whole other dimension
[24:54.800 --> 24:59.000]  to the broadcast.
[24:59.000 --> 25:08.000]  Now, Bush expanded government at a record level never before seen tripling the size
[25:08.000 --> 25:09.800]  of the federal budget.
[25:09.800 --> 25:17.600]  Obama in less than one year, eight years, eight months into office, he spent more than
[25:17.600 --> 25:23.200]  Bush did in the previous eight years, but more than that from Bush back to George Washington.
[25:23.200 --> 25:25.160]  That's an official number.
[25:25.160 --> 25:27.480]  Now they're only expanding government more.
[25:27.480 --> 25:34.120]  The vast majority of new jobs in the country are government jobs, controller jobs, parasite
[25:34.120 --> 25:42.160]  jobs, and he's broken all of his promises and is going to raise taxes basically on
[25:42.160 --> 25:47.120]  everybody in one way or another.
[25:47.120 --> 25:49.560]  And there's no talk of actually cutting the budget.
[25:49.560 --> 25:51.480]  There's no talk of cutting government.
[25:51.480 --> 25:53.360]  There's no talk of cutting state government.
[25:53.360 --> 26:01.040]  It's just bigger and bigger and bigger, sucking off of more people, running our lives, imprisoning
[26:01.040 --> 26:05.360]  us in a control grid, putting in the naked body scanners.
[26:05.360 --> 26:14.320]  Meanwhile, top economist at the New York Business School, Robini sees very dismal and poor U.S.
[26:14.320 --> 26:15.320]  expansion.
[26:15.320 --> 26:18.760]  The only part of the economy expanding is the government and the banks.
[26:18.760 --> 26:22.200]  The rest of the economy is falling apart.
[26:22.200 --> 26:24.000]  Same thing in Europe and England.
[26:24.000 --> 26:30.040]  Half of new jobs are created by the state, times of London.
[26:30.040 --> 26:36.840]  Tulsa World is reporting that Obama bribed a lot of people in universal healthcare pursuit.
[26:36.840 --> 26:42.280]  I mean, unprecedented, saying that the labor unions were exempt from the rules the rest
[26:42.280 --> 26:49.920]  of us are under, that government of bureaucrats are exempt, giving hundreds of millions of
[26:49.920 --> 26:54.880]  dollars per house and Senate member who would vote for it out in the open.
[26:54.880 --> 27:00.440]  Two Tulsa area legislators were the featured speakers for a Tea Party event inside the
[27:00.440 --> 27:04.840]  Oklahoma Capitol on the first day of the legislative session yesterday.
[27:04.840 --> 27:12.040]  Representative Mike Ritza, Republican of Broken Arrow and Senator Randy Brogdon, pulled a
[27:12.040 --> 27:17.160]  crowd of about 75 in the Capitol retundent or reject national healthcare reform and
[27:17.160 --> 27:21.520]  support the proposed state constitutional amendment, exempting Oklahoma from the national
[27:21.520 --> 27:23.400]  healthcare mandates.
[27:23.400 --> 27:28.880]  So the good news is, it probably won't pass in the House or Senate now, but the bureaucracy
[27:28.880 --> 27:31.720]  will still try to implement it, but the states are going to block it.
[27:31.720 --> 27:37.880]  See, we're fighting at every level and having success.
[27:37.880 --> 27:42.400]  Ritza said President Obama has bribed a lot of people in pursuit of the healthcare but
[27:42.400 --> 27:44.600]  forgot to bribe you the people.
[27:44.600 --> 27:49.240]  Brogdon, a Republican candidate for governor, said Congress should not be wasting its time
[27:49.240 --> 27:56.520]  with and your money, even discussing national healthcare policy.
[27:56.520 --> 28:02.200]  About 13% of Oklahomans have no healthcare insurance, a figure well above the national
[28:02.200 --> 28:03.720]  average.
[28:03.720 --> 28:08.320]  And what will cutting Medicare and Medicaid and raising taxes do to get them healthcare?
[28:08.320 --> 28:09.320]  It won't.
[28:09.320 --> 28:17.120]  The other swindle by the insurance companies owned and controlled by the big banks.
[28:17.120 --> 28:21.000]  And so later in the next hour, when Mike Rivera's on, whether someone opened the phones up about
[28:21.000 --> 28:26.800]  all of Obama's broken promises and all of his new taxes and how do we ensure that as
[28:26.800 --> 28:31.680]  Republicans in the backlash take over the House and Senate in the next few elections
[28:31.680 --> 28:36.040]  and then the presidency note out in three years, unless Obama stages a big terror attack,
[28:36.040 --> 28:44.000]  how do we make them dismantle what George Bush and Bill Clinton and George Bush senior
[28:44.000 --> 28:51.720]  and Barack Obama have set up because these guys are working in tandem together?
[28:51.720 --> 28:56.920]  How do we ensure this revolution against tyranny is peaceful and truly successful because we've
[28:56.920 --> 29:02.160]  got the facts, we've got the Constitution, we've got common sense and common law and
[29:02.160 --> 29:07.880]  we've got the people on our side and they can't bait and switch by putting Democrats
[29:07.880 --> 29:10.280]  in and then putting Republicans in anymore.
[29:10.280 --> 29:15.160]  That trick took six years, seven years for folks to wake up to Bush being a fraud.
[29:15.160 --> 29:19.600]  It took less than a year for Obama to become the most unpopular president one year in
[29:19.600 --> 29:24.880]  ever and he's plunging at record levels.
[29:24.880 --> 29:37.400]  But the establishment is going to strike back and strike back in a big way.
[29:37.400 --> 29:42.280]  And so the question is, how do we warn the public about the tricks that the enemy has
[29:42.280 --> 29:44.560]  up their sleeve?
[29:44.560 --> 29:51.320]  We'll come back, get into Kramer and the Illuminati and a lot more.
[29:51.320 --> 30:00.760]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run, Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[30:00.760 --> 30:04.680]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Acola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator
[30:04.680 --> 30:07.600]  that produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.

[31:06.360 --> 31:09.520]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[31:09.520 --> 31:15.120]  These are finishing off this agenda that we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans
[31:15.120 --> 31:16.120]  at home.
[31:16.120 --> 31:20.000]  I have tremendous influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the
[31:20.000 --> 31:21.000]  shots.
[31:21.000 --> 31:25.880]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[31:25.880 --> 31:29.160]  Full of the republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[31:29.160 --> 31:35.000]  The criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing
[31:35.000 --> 31:36.000]  world government.
[31:36.000 --> 31:40.440]  Jim Geithner, Bernanke and Arsonists, they're asking for more matches and the Congress is
[31:40.440 --> 31:42.520]  saying who do we make the check out to?
[31:42.520 --> 31:48.360]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington D.C. we have seen a fall
[31:48.360 --> 31:49.680]  of the republic.

[32:13.520 --> 32:16.640]  more than you would legally be required to pay creditors?
[32:16.640 --> 32:18.800]  These are not ways to help you get out of debt.
[32:18.800 --> 32:23.440]  They are expensive payment plans and if you're in debt already does it make sense to load
[32:23.440 --> 32:25.560]  yourself up with another payment plan?

[33:21.600 --> 33:27.760]  Coming up I want to play the clip that we aired last week would really break it down and analyze
[33:27.760 --> 33:35.160]  it from Kramer telling us how much we should love and worship Bernanke and Geithner and
[33:35.160 --> 33:44.720]  Paulson and then Dylan Radigan calling out Obama last week on pushing the big tarp lie
[33:44.720 --> 33:49.600]  and we've got to give credit where credit is due and every time I tune in to Radigan he's
[33:49.600 --> 33:52.760]  telling it like it is.
[33:52.760 --> 33:56.760]  And I guess on every channel they let one guy tell the truth at least on some issues
[33:56.760 --> 33:58.880]  like Beck or Radigan.
[33:58.880 --> 34:03.080]  But Radigan likes Ron Paul and isn't saying arrest Ron Paul supporters and Ron Paul supporters
[34:03.080 --> 34:10.560]  are terrorists and there are no FEMA camps and we need new taxes like Glenn Beck is.
[34:10.560 --> 34:15.200]  I guess if you're a phony conservative you can call for more taxes value added taxes
[34:15.200 --> 34:20.840]  sales taxes excise taxes I just still can't get over the fact that I randomly tuned in
[34:20.840 --> 34:23.840]  to Beck this morning and he was calling for taxes.
[34:23.840 --> 34:30.320]  We don't owe these banks the money they've robbed us they need to go to prison.
[34:30.320 --> 34:38.200]  They are the parasites that have set up a shadow government so that they can get away
[34:38.200 --> 34:40.520]  with their crimes and suppress the people.
[34:40.520 --> 34:44.400]  So I'm going to talk about that coming up in a moment.

[37:08.320 --> 37:14.640]  on couples making two hundred thousand dollars he had lied during the campaign and said only
[37:14.640 --> 37:20.880]  individuals making over five hundred thousand will pay the 40 tax rate
[37:20.880 --> 37:32.000]  that's really higher than that but they say 39.6 now he changed it and said okay if two of you
[37:32.000 --> 37:42.080]  make 500,000 combined a husband and wife or a common law couple you will then be forced
[37:43.280 --> 37:47.280]  to pay the new higher taxes and they're getting rid of a bunch of loopholes like
[37:47.280 --> 37:55.200]  tax exemptions like your house like insurance oh you can't ride off money you spend on insurance
[37:55.200 --> 38:01.120]  that's how we're going to help you get health care I mean it's all in the new budget all the
[38:01.120 --> 38:06.000]  new green taxes they don't care if the senate doesn't pass it they don't need any stinking laws
[38:06.880 --> 38:11.280]  just like the austin police department the batf don't need any laws to shut down a legal gun show
[38:11.840 --> 38:17.040]  they'll just order the epa to put all these new taxes on every form of energy and to take over
[38:17.040 --> 38:23.440]  your cities 2.6 billion in the next three years in austin if the city council later this month
[38:23.440 --> 38:30.880]  passes the carbon tax higher than the federal made-up standards they don't need any stinking laws
[38:41.600 --> 38:45.440]  they just do whatever they want because they're lawless it's like the bank stole
[38:45.440 --> 38:53.680]  28 trillion and counting that number's a month old and the reason I talk about the 28 trillion
[38:53.680 --> 39:00.560]  all the time is because there is such widespread ignorance out there in the obama deception and
[39:00.560 --> 39:06.400]  fall the republic we chronicle what is happening in real time we show the congressional hearings
[39:06.400 --> 39:13.360]  the boil downs where they admitted when obama deception came out it was 12 trillion when fall
[39:13.360 --> 39:20.720]  the republic came out it was 23.7 trillion and we chronicle how they're robbing us and how it's
[39:20.720 --> 39:26.480]  illegal and how they're giving themselves the very money that they steal from the public the very
[39:26.480 --> 39:32.880]  regulators the private fed head the new york fed head the government head of the treasury it's a
[39:32.880 --> 39:40.480]  revolving door the sec is run by these crooks and now they're getting you ready for all the new
[39:40.480 --> 39:48.480]  taxes just like your brazil or just like your nigeria taken over by the new world order taken
[39:48.480 --> 39:56.800]  over by the banks where they raise the taxes up to stratospheric rates and then you don't even get
[39:56.800 --> 40:01.360]  any benefits from its so-called government services that all gets slashed
[40:01.360 --> 40:12.560]  i was looking at the budget numbers for austin texas last week austin has every year in debt
[40:12.560 --> 40:22.720]  payments over 500 million dollars and the roads get 70 million the roads get 70 million the debt
[40:22.720 --> 40:26.800]  service and the debt only only goes up they it's like a credit card they pay the minimum amount
[40:26.800 --> 40:33.920]  over 500 million dollars a year and when they're done i mean it's going to be over a billion a year
[40:35.440 --> 40:41.200]  that we're going to be paying in carbon taxes or close to a billion they just don't care
[40:42.640 --> 40:46.880]  as long as they do it incrementally the public will squirm and won't like it and won't like a
[40:46.880 --> 40:51.680]  cop on every corner with a radar gun or cops arresting you for talking on your cell phone and
[40:51.680 --> 40:57.920]  $500 fines and you know $200 fines for jaywalking and oh your kid was late to class three times
[40:57.920 --> 41:01.360]  we're going to charge him with truancy even though the state statute doesn't say that that's
[41:01.360 --> 41:07.600]  illegal and that truancy's many more days missed not late to class they don't care they know you're
[41:07.600 --> 41:13.520]  ignorant they know you are a chump ready to be raped and i keep using the example of my town
[41:13.520 --> 41:23.520]  where i live it's going on everywhere but kramer says that's not a problem kramer who's up there
[41:23.520 --> 41:30.480]  to sucker all the yuppies into the stocks they want to rip them off with the sucker rally master
[41:30.480 --> 41:39.200]  he makes me sick so here is kramer worshiping the bankers that robbed us and then telling us
[41:39.200 --> 41:44.480]  how great the illuminati is this is a man who did along with bernand he saved western real cattle
[41:44.480 --> 41:49.680]  have people forgotten what it was like during those moments when polson who also got religion
[41:49.680 --> 41:54.880]  pushed for tarp do they not know that we were about to be in a barter economy there was a day
[41:54.880 --> 42:00.560]  when hank got on his knees in front of fancy polosi there was a day well that should make people
[42:00.560 --> 42:04.880]  i mean sit down in the circumstance you know in the new york times it is serious stories about about
[42:04.880 --> 42:10.240]  aig and goldman they never talk about how much aig built out the european banks this is a uniquely
[42:10.240 --> 42:14.800]  focused on what the new york times reported all these guys want to score points tim geithner is
[42:14.800 --> 42:20.320]  doing a good job again is that terrible to say can't we just come out here occasionally can't
[42:20.320 --> 42:24.240]  i as a commentator and say you know what i'm impressed by what geithner would get a bodyguard
[42:25.040 --> 42:31.600]  i already have one and i feel strongly that geithner uh this is aig aig goldman goldman and
[42:31.600 --> 42:35.760]  you know what the bavarian womanati the trilateral commission goldman sacks in the queen of england
[42:35.760 --> 42:43.920]  are not all bad wow we gotta squeeze a couple of things sure okay now what really happened is
[42:43.920 --> 42:49.760]  polson and geithner went into closed door meetings and we have two congressmen and a senator on record
[42:51.520 --> 42:58.080]  on this show and on c span they went in and said you do this or we will have a depression
[42:58.080 --> 43:05.840]  by next week and congress said no and so bernacky and polson and geithner went on tv and said
[43:06.560 --> 43:12.320]  road warrior collapse of society bar economy we're dead it is a depression
[43:13.920 --> 43:19.520]  knowing that would destroy global confidence and stock market slid on a planetary scale more than
[43:19.520 --> 43:27.840]  20 in one day the average 401k lost more than 40 of its value and they came back and they said
[43:27.840 --> 43:33.360]  now you give us unlimited money to rob you or we're going to slit the throat of this economy
[43:34.160 --> 43:44.960]  and the congress said hyal hitler they said hail seizer hail tyranny yes hijackers you've
[43:44.960 --> 43:52.000]  got a gun to our head we'll do whatever you say rob us and now they've got their spokesman on the
[43:52.000 --> 43:56.800]  left and right saying we got to have new taxes or we're going to have another depression they're
[43:56.800 --> 44:02.800]  already saying we got to raise new taxes or the dollar is going to be destroyed and america's over
[44:04.320 --> 44:10.560]  america's over if we allow these people to continue now this clip is up on prisonplanet.com
[44:10.560 --> 44:17.280]  the headline is radigan calls out obama on pushing the big tarp live you want to pull it up just
[44:17.280 --> 44:26.720]  type that in and it'll pull up on the search engine for you on google so this is someone on on msnbc
[44:26.720 --> 44:34.560]  the sister of cnbc saying the illuminati is bad and that they stole 23 plus trillion this is the
[44:34.560 --> 44:40.000]  old number from october but at least they're getting it partially right here it is explain to you
[44:40.960 --> 44:44.560]  okay i guess some of you haven't watched the congressional hearings you haven't read bloomberg
[44:44.560 --> 44:49.040]  you don't know what the real numbers are you think it's 700 billion i get your emails every day
[44:49.040 --> 44:58.800]  no it's not watch obama deception watch fall of the republic here's radigan i want to go back for
[44:58.800 --> 45:03.120]  a second to the president and his olive branch i don't know if we still have that olive branch
[45:03.120 --> 45:07.920]  around here anywhere but he has extended quite a few of them particularly in that state of the union
[45:07.920 --> 45:14.240]  speech he's offered up what he sees as some great solutions to some of our most pressing problems
[45:14.240 --> 45:20.720]  education health care we know the narratives and while the president talks about jobs rightly so
[45:21.360 --> 45:26.240]  and stimulus money and getting our money back from the bankers there's the olive branch so he
[45:26.240 --> 45:34.320]  is extending this as he has that conversation and it's compelling and you want to help him you want
[45:34.320 --> 45:39.120]  to help him fix the process you want to figure out a way to get rid of the influence of special
[45:39.120 --> 45:45.040]  interests whether you're on the left or the right you know it's hurting our country but we
[45:45.040 --> 45:51.440]  fear that our president right now is like a man preparing to run a marathon even with an olive
[45:51.440 --> 45:58.880]  branch while ignoring the fact that he has a gigantic i don't have a thorn crop i'm sorry
[45:58.880 --> 46:06.960]  a giant thorn in his foot and the thorn that i'm talking about is the big tarp lie the president
[46:06.960 --> 46:16.880]  continues to say in public that banks have almost paid americans back that is a lie the fact is
[46:16.880 --> 46:25.040]  the tarp which congress approved is only two percent of the trillions of dollars and free
[46:25.040 --> 46:34.160]  money being provided to our banks by the federal reserve and the treasury the american people know
[46:34.160 --> 46:41.680]  this they know that they are and up on screen for radio listeners it says behind the bailout and it
[46:41.680 --> 46:52.320]  shows a pie with a tiny slice cut out that says tarp two percent and the total pie is 23.7 trillion
[46:52.320 --> 46:59.040]  again that's the number from last october so you're actually hearing the truth for a change on
[46:59.040 --> 47:06.720]  television this is hard to believe continue subsidizing our banking sector and yet the tarp lie
[47:07.520 --> 47:14.240]  continues to be spread by our politicians our problem mr president is either you don't understand
[47:14.240 --> 47:21.600]  it which i doubt i'm sure you do you don't want the american people to understand it which would
[47:21.600 --> 47:29.840]  be understandable although i also doubt that or perhaps you're hoping no one will notice all the
[47:29.840 --> 47:35.680]  other support and the big spend the infinity from the fed will make the whole thing go away which is
[47:35.680 --> 47:42.000]  what i really think is going on but i'm here to tell you the problem will not go away until you
[47:42.000 --> 47:49.520]  actually fix it you see we know the american people know that the ceo's of the banks turned into
[47:49.520 --> 47:58.080]  casinos like goldman sacks jp morgan city group and aig have paid themselves hundreds of billions
[47:58.080 --> 48:03.280]  of dollars building the debt bombs i was just talking about and exploiting the zero percent money
[48:03.280 --> 48:10.000]  from the fed and the free money they get from the treasury the rewards for this go to the bankers
[48:10.000 --> 48:14.720]  in for in the form of compensation particularly the ceo's who are the ones that decide how much
[48:14.720 --> 48:23.040]  risk the bank can take meanwhile the risks those banks take ultimately the losses on all their
[48:23.040 --> 48:31.040]  gambling go to us the people and are harvested from our label in our labor excuse me in the form of
[48:31.040 --> 48:38.240]  our taxes and worse the extraordinary returns offered by the bankers fraudulent practices
[48:38.960 --> 48:43.920]  are like a black hole for america sucking money that would otherwise be getting invested in our
[48:43.920 --> 48:48.240]  country but why would i go through the trouble of dealing with the investment when i have a funny
[48:48.240 --> 48:53.600]  money machine legalized by the government over here that's done in secret at the bank adding
[48:53.600 --> 48:59.040]  insult to injury the same giant banks are using the free money access granted to them by our
[48:59.040 --> 49:07.760]  political body to lend to foreign countries that seek to compete with us the banks do this because
[49:07.760 --> 49:12.080]  it's more profitable for the bank ceo's to lend to them than it is to go to the trouble to lending
[49:12.080 --> 49:18.720]  to america even if it's coming at america's expense why would we the people vote for you the
[49:18.720 --> 49:26.240]  politicians to do that to us unbelievable truth and it goes on and on and on that's only part of
[49:26.240 --> 49:32.960]  the video up at prison planet dot com titled rattingham calls out obama on pushing the big
[49:32.960 --> 49:41.120]  tarp line now that was the truth i can't believe they allow that on television you will not hear
[49:41.120 --> 49:51.120]  glenn beck go that far now look the bottom line here is it is not a virtual black hole it is a
[49:51.120 --> 49:57.680]  financial black hole designed to conquer us financially that's why the banks are in control
[49:57.680 --> 50:05.200]  they are ruthless criminal conquerors and it's all done by fraud and nothing is going to get better
[50:05.200 --> 50:11.360]  the the more money they pile on is the more power they get and it's like giving someone who you're
[50:11.360 --> 50:19.280]  bleeding to death painkillers so they don't feel it that's all they're doing is incrementally
[50:19.280 --> 50:26.480]  killing us if it all came at once we'd stand up and say no and they know what they're doing
[50:26.480 --> 50:32.400]  the bailout money has gone to move our final corporations overseas it's gone to move the
[50:32.400 --> 50:38.000]  car companies overseas this is coordinated you heard the head scientist at nasa say they want
[50:38.000 --> 50:44.640]  to destroy our industrial society you've heard morris strong say these people are villains so
[50:44.640 --> 50:49.920]  remember all these new taxes you're going to pay even if it's to a local city that's going to the
[50:49.920 --> 50:56.800]  banks is for these bankers you just remember that remember who's raping you remember who the real
[50:56.800 --> 51:08.640]  enemy is stay with us our economy is in great distress the financial dominoes can fall at any

[52:14.000 --> 52:20.160]  americans at home i have a tremendous influence on our president in congress and they really are
[52:20.160 --> 52:26.480]  calling the shots i think it's incumbent upon all of us as american citizens to pay attention

[52:32.240 --> 52:37.360]  bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government tim geithner

[54:30.080 --> 54:35.920]  people's children who have learning disabilities and they want to move this same system here to
[54:35.920 --> 54:42.800]  the united states but i do want to open the phones up in the next hour with the fact that
[54:42.800 --> 54:47.680]  we are blocking the health care we're blocking the federal international takeover through the
[54:47.680 --> 54:54.880]  carbon taxes but they're still trying to implement it but we don't give up we continue to fight because
[54:54.880 --> 55:01.360]  we're having victory and we have the moral high ground we're forcing them to show their hand that
[55:01.360 --> 55:07.040]  they're doing this extra legislatively extra judicially through the executive and they can't do
[55:07.040 --> 55:13.280]  it the states are standing up and fighting back there is a fighting spirit rising across the world
[55:13.280 --> 55:24.320]  so what do we do as a people when they're planning to raise all these new taxes on us
[55:25.520 --> 55:32.000]  to fund the very banks that are holding us hostage what do we do we continue to identify the enemy
[55:32.640 --> 55:38.640]  we continue to protest the fed we continue to push for its audit that's past the house now in
[55:38.640 --> 55:48.560]  the senate we continue to identify the enemy and as things get worse and worse as things get more
[55:48.560 --> 55:58.320]  and more intense as the tyranny intensifies the people of the world are waking up because we
[55:58.320 --> 56:05.120]  have been there exposing who the real enemy is it's a long march it's a long fight it's a hundred
[56:05.120 --> 56:13.200]  rounds and we're about 65 rounds into the fight and both sides are dazed and bleeding and now
[56:13.200 --> 56:21.680]  it's down to whoever wants it the most believing you can win having confidence when you wake people
[56:21.680 --> 56:28.880]  up reaching out to others not buying into the coantel pro in fighting this is the winning spirit
[56:28.880 --> 56:37.120]  that can defeat the new world order separately in the last hour i want to get into smart stack the
[56:37.120 --> 56:45.600]  new corn that combines eight different genetically modified previous corn products created by monsanto
[56:47.520 --> 56:55.840]  six of the eight traits have different pesticides that grow it's a pharmacological crop the the
[56:55.840 --> 57:06.560]  corn grows a pesticide to kill six different bugs and then we eat that and that's just one gmo product
[57:06.560 --> 57:11.920]  and monsanto responsible for more than 70 of all the big gmo crops that are out there some
[57:11.920 --> 57:21.840]  estimates say 90 is patenting and now rolling out on every front with every major food crop there is
[57:21.840 --> 57:29.360]  for decades it's just been the staple soybeans corn wheat tomatoes potatoes things like that they
[57:29.360 --> 57:37.760]  are now rolling out with everything and in every major study it shows massive liver damage kidney
[57:37.760 --> 57:44.800]  damage blood damage in every mammal species they feed it to i mean how big of an issue is that
[57:44.800 --> 57:53.040]  that in plain view this is going on what does that tell you about the elite that are running things
[57:55.360 --> 58:00.080]  what does that tell you about their mindset these are the issues we cover
[58:02.160 --> 58:09.600]  and i've also got a clip of glenn beck making fun of a caller a few weeks ago saying he quote
[58:09.600 --> 58:17.760]  wants to drink buckets of fluoride well that would kill you if you ate a teaspoon of fluoride
[58:17.760 --> 58:25.760]  you would die within an hour rat poison is less than one percent fluoride so somebody needs to
[58:25.760 --> 58:31.280]  explain to glenn beck he better stop telling listeners to drink buckets of fluoride because
[58:31.280 --> 58:42.000]  you die before you ate four or five teaspoons of it so that insanity is coming up we'll be right back
[58:42.480 --> 58:52.720]  you are listening to gcn visit gcnlive.com today this is alex jones with five good reasons you
[58:52.720 --> 58:57.760]  should consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily
[58:57.760 --> 59:03.120]  double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control how much power
[59:03.120 --> 59:08.560]  your electric company allows you to have it's true total government control of electricity in the name
[59:08.560 --> 59:13.840]  of smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[59:13.840 --> 59:19.120]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem
[59:19.120 --> 59:24.240]  number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families
[59:24.240 --> 59:28.800]  lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator provides
[59:28.800 --> 59:33.360]  powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks i really believe in the solar power generators
[59:33.360 --> 59:37.840]  offered by solutions from science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at

[1:01:00.720 --> 1:01:10.000]  censorship openly being announced openly being pushed and declared by italy australia new zealand
[1:01:10.000 --> 1:01:16.000]  england cyber securities are resigning saying it's appending on takeover south australia
[1:01:16.000 --> 1:01:21.520]  government gags internet debate about political candidates now not allowed that's the news of
[1:01:21.520 --> 1:01:28.640]  australia mainstream media i mean this is getting insane i want to talk about obama's new giant
[1:01:28.640 --> 1:01:35.200]  tax program i want to get into the banks calling for a global regulatory body to punish the banks
[1:01:35.200 --> 1:01:39.040]  just like the fellow reserve was supposed to punish the banks when it really gave them power
[1:01:39.040 --> 1:01:44.160]  they want world government one way or the other we're going to be breaking it all down today
[1:01:45.120 --> 1:01:50.800]  and taking your phone calls with mike revero mike good to have you here with us thank you for
[1:01:50.800 --> 1:01:56.000]  having me on the show today there is so much going on i just threw out a few of the issues
[1:01:56.000 --> 1:02:00.880]  and topics i want to get your take on uh what do you think is most important you've got missile
[1:02:00.880 --> 1:02:05.440]  cruisers and weapons being moved in openly talking about hitting iran what do you think
[1:02:05.440 --> 1:02:10.720]  is most important right now well i think we're definitely seeing a renewed push for a new war
[1:02:10.720 --> 1:02:16.960]  in iran uh and it seems like the government of the united states either goaded by israel
[1:02:16.960 --> 1:02:20.560]  or simply because they can't think of anything else to do they're going to try and get out of
[1:02:20.560 --> 1:02:25.040]  the mess they're in by starting a war and hoping that the american people will simply follow the
[1:02:25.040 --> 1:02:29.760]  flag off the edge of the cliff with the government uh unfortunately we have a lot of history in this
[1:02:29.760 --> 1:02:34.800]  nation where the government repeatedly gets itself into some extreme financial situations
[1:02:34.800 --> 1:02:40.240]  then sees war as their best way out and it has worked in the past with world war one and world
[1:02:40.240 --> 1:02:45.760]  war two i don't see it working now but i think the u.s. government has basically run out of any i
[1:02:45.760 --> 1:02:50.720]  any other ideas that they can try right now they're broke they're in debt even if they nationalized
[1:02:50.720 --> 1:02:55.920]  every private asset of every american citizen that would only cover about one quarter of the
[1:02:55.920 --> 1:03:04.480]  whole they've dug themselves into and meanwhile uh their health care plans failing their swine flu
[1:03:04.480 --> 1:03:09.760]  hoax is failing their global carbon tax is failing but they're not stopping obama just says i'm
[1:03:09.760 --> 1:03:15.120]  going to use executive orders and do it regardless yeah and that's a very very dangerous situation
[1:03:15.120 --> 1:03:19.680]  because he's making it clear that the government has broken away from the will of the people or
[1:03:19.680 --> 1:03:26.640]  even the best interests of the people and i was talking with somebody earlier today uh that it looks
[1:03:26.640 --> 1:03:31.200]  like they're going to go ahead with the attack on iran and they no longer care if we know it's
[1:03:31.200 --> 1:03:36.480]  legit or not even as we're finding the british parliament is agreeing that yes there was no
[1:03:36.480 --> 1:03:41.840]  legal basis for the attack on iraq blair is already out there saying we've got to go into iran the
[1:03:41.840 --> 1:03:48.160]  problem with that approach is that if you go back to your art of war by sun zoo victory always goes
[1:03:48.160 --> 1:03:53.360]  to the army that believes they have the moral right on their side and if the united states
[1:03:53.360 --> 1:03:58.480]  starts yet another war with an army that knows they're the bad guys that they're the invaders
[1:03:58.480 --> 1:04:03.120]  and conquerors and they're not fighting for anything that is morally right they're going in
[1:04:03.120 --> 1:04:07.520]  with a tremendous disadvantage that our wonder weapons is not going to be able to overcome
[1:04:07.520 --> 1:04:10.560]  well that brings me to the next point we come back in the long segment
[1:04:11.200 --> 1:04:16.720]  clearly the underwear bomber was a staged event it's now admitted in mainstream news but buried
[1:04:16.720 --> 1:04:20.880]  in the articles that okay the state department ordered them to let him on the plane and he
[1:04:20.880 --> 1:04:26.240]  didn't have a passport but we helped him obviously meaning the smartdress man was a government agent
[1:04:26.240 --> 1:04:30.480]  who else can get somebody on board a plane and and pass the security checkpoints of the naked
[1:04:30.480 --> 1:04:35.600]  body scanners and this is clearly a kickoff for the new police state we're seeing all these new
[1:04:35.600 --> 1:04:42.000]  fake bin laden tapes they're going to need to stage a new terror attack a new 911 to go into iran i
[1:04:42.000 --> 1:04:47.600]  believe uh or politically worldwide it would be too damaging for even the arrogant hubris filled
[1:04:48.160 --> 1:04:52.560]  globalist so i want to get your take on that micro vero on the other side then we'll get
[1:04:52.560 --> 1:05:00.240]  into the economy internet censorship the global tyranny takeover is moving into a high gear phase

[1:09:11.120 --> 1:09:17.680]  and again mike revero joins us for stations that just uh that just tuned in some don't carry that
[1:09:17.680 --> 1:09:24.640]  first five minute segment we were well i mean recap the geopolitical state of the global empire
[1:09:24.640 --> 1:09:31.440]  that's basically used america up now it wants to use us finally uh to go into iran then fully
[1:09:31.440 --> 1:09:36.640]  bankrupt us after we funded china and europe's rise uh there's no way they're going to be able to
[1:09:36.640 --> 1:09:41.440]  attack iran which they're clearly gearing up to do and moving weapon systems and more ships and
[1:09:41.440 --> 1:09:47.600]  missiles in they and and and new sanctions they clearly can't do that without a stage terror attack
[1:09:47.600 --> 1:09:52.320]  and then we have the underwear bombing situation where it's now come out that the u.s. government
[1:09:52.320 --> 1:09:56.720]  ordered him to be allowed on the plane that's in the detroit news that's in other mainstream
[1:09:56.720 --> 1:10:03.200]  newspapers but buried in the article like it's no big deal that okay there was a second guy on the
[1:10:03.200 --> 1:10:08.320]  plane he did supposedly have a bomb we did lie about kurt haskell and say that he wasn't telling
[1:10:08.320 --> 1:10:13.600]  the truth yes he has other witnesses uh yes the state department ordered him to be allowed on the
[1:10:13.600 --> 1:10:19.520]  plane then one of their people let him on the plane this is huge information so start with
[1:10:19.520 --> 1:10:25.520]  the state of the empire mike i want your take on this uh what the empire needs do you agree with me
[1:10:25.520 --> 1:10:30.640]  that they need a stage terror attack and the underwear bomber was the kickoff that the new
[1:10:30.640 --> 1:10:36.240]  fake which they even admit they can't even prove a real bin laden tapes coming out uh right as the
[1:10:36.240 --> 1:10:42.320]  yemen operation starts i mean this this this really looks bad mike it looks bad there's one moment
[1:10:42.320 --> 1:10:46.560]  of levity in the whole situation and then of course was the bin laden tape in which he's critical of
[1:10:46.560 --> 1:10:51.200]  global warming which i think was pushing a little bit too far to be believable and a lot of people
[1:10:51.200 --> 1:10:54.880]  actually got a chuckle out of that but you're absolutely right they need a false flag they
[1:10:54.880 --> 1:10:59.680]  need something that is so big and horrific it's going to shock americans into supporting whatever
[1:10:59.680 --> 1:11:04.880]  the government wants to do it's got to be so big that it shocks americans into unquestioning obedience
[1:11:04.880 --> 1:11:09.440]  without even thinking the crotch bomber was not it they didn't get any traction with it
[1:11:09.440 --> 1:11:14.480]  symbolic gestures almost maybe that's not going to work they need something really
[1:11:14.480 --> 1:11:18.480]  horrifically big and there are two targets of opportunity coming up in the next couple of
[1:11:18.480 --> 1:11:23.040]  weeks the first of course is the olympics up in canada and we already know there's something
[1:11:23.040 --> 1:11:28.880]  like two tons of explosive that went missing from a company that is partly owned by the carlyle group
[1:11:28.880 --> 1:11:32.640]  now the company is trying to say that all the explosives aren't missing it was just a clerical
[1:11:32.640 --> 1:11:37.120]  error but the police are saying they can't validate that the explosives have been accounted for
[1:11:37.120 --> 1:11:41.600]  so that situation is in play and of course we have the super bowl coming up kind of like those
[1:11:41.600 --> 1:11:46.400]  missing cruise missiles with cheney and then at least 11 members of the base being murdered to
[1:11:46.400 --> 1:11:51.440]  cover it up yeah the missing nuclear weapons i mean the whole the whole credibility of the
[1:11:51.440 --> 1:11:57.280]  iran war is going to be based on proving to america that iran really did have nuclear weapons
[1:11:57.280 --> 1:12:03.280]  after all not only to recover from the i a a reports and the national intelligence estimate
[1:12:03.280 --> 1:12:09.040]  but also from the lie in iraq and so the possibility of our government or israel setting off a small
[1:12:09.040 --> 1:12:14.160]  nuclear weapon someplace in the united states or canada cannot be discounted completely and i know
[1:12:14.160 --> 1:12:19.760]  it sounds fantastical and like it's from a james bond movie but we know that 9 11 that cover-up is
[1:12:19.760 --> 1:12:25.200]  beginning to fall apart we've got world leaders saying it needs an objective outside investigation
[1:12:25.200 --> 1:12:28.960]  more and more of the rest of the world's governments are seeing this it was a false
[1:12:28.960 --> 1:12:35.200]  flag attack to kick off a new war but isn't it even bigger than that clearly the u.s has been
[1:12:35.200 --> 1:12:43.360]  positioned worldwide as the new bogeyman yes rupert murdoch owned papers worldwide bashes
[1:12:43.360 --> 1:12:49.840]  then domestically uh you know he poses as a conservative to control the libertarian movement
[1:12:49.840 --> 1:12:56.800]  uh clearly america does the dirty work and then we're imploded and we're now beginning to come
[1:12:56.800 --> 1:13:03.120]  to that point i agree with you with we're the new nazi power and it's amazing how closely our
[1:13:03.120 --> 1:13:08.000]  government is following adolf hitler's playbook both from the false flag attack in new york
[1:13:08.000 --> 1:13:12.800]  which matches the operation in glywitz to the selection of an ethnic minority to be used
[1:13:12.800 --> 1:13:19.200]  as a scapegoat and a social target it's the same propaganda tricks over and over again
[1:13:19.200 --> 1:13:24.640]  and it's going to end the same way look at how germany ended world war two that is the future
[1:13:24.640 --> 1:13:29.520]  of america unless the american people are willing to grab their government by the lapels and say
[1:13:29.520 --> 1:13:34.640]  we're not following you well that's the good news and i want you to really walk through this i mean
[1:13:34.640 --> 1:13:45.280]  chronicle all the hoaxes the flu the wmds uh the banker bailout uh just on every front the carbon
[1:13:45.280 --> 1:13:52.640]  tax the health care takeover everything they're doing is failing and you talk about the government
[1:13:52.640 --> 1:13:58.080]  ignoring the people that the executive in the bureaucracy is even ignoring their own congress
[1:13:58.080 --> 1:14:05.840]  i mean this is rogue government it absolutely is and a big part of the problem is that our top leaders
[1:14:05.840 --> 1:14:10.800]  are so insulated from the rest of the world by all these yes men and yes women that cluster around
[1:14:10.800 --> 1:14:16.640]  them i don't think they understand the extent to which ordinary americans understand we have been
[1:14:16.640 --> 1:14:21.360]  lied to on a monumental scale americans are the most lied to people on the face of the earth
[1:14:21.360 --> 1:14:27.200]  whether it's climate gate or the when pigs fly flew or the or or tarp and all the rest of that
[1:14:27.200 --> 1:14:34.320]  we see that it is an unending series of lies going back to saddam's nuclear bombs i think our our
[1:14:34.320 --> 1:14:41.200]  government leaders obama and the war hawks they're so insulated i don't think they understand uh the
[1:14:41.200 --> 1:14:45.120]  degree to which their credibility has been destroyed now some people obviously do you're
[1:14:45.120 --> 1:14:50.240]  talking before about this sudden push for internet censorship we're hearing the united nations call
[1:14:50.800 --> 1:14:56.800]  for uh web operators to be licensed in order to control who is allowed and not allowed to create
[1:14:56.800 --> 1:15:01.760]  a website this i think is a knee-jerk reaction to the fact that it was the blogosphere and it was
[1:15:01.760 --> 1:15:08.000]  the alternative media that brought down the whole climate gate hoax and absolutely exposed to the
[1:15:08.000 --> 1:15:13.360]  world that these kind of large-scale conspiracies between government and academia and corporate
[1:15:13.360 --> 1:15:18.640]  media yeah they really do exist we've got one staked out on the dirt feet of study all you want
[1:15:18.640 --> 1:15:23.680]  and i think this the the globalists are having a fear reaction they're trying to find some way
[1:15:23.680 --> 1:15:30.000]  they can drag us back to the glory days of the 1950s where they just wave russians at us and pump
[1:15:30.000 --> 1:15:34.720]  lies at us through the tv and we had no alternative but to sit there and accept it and believe it
[1:15:34.720 --> 1:15:39.120]  but it's a completely different environment and they are failing to evolve to that new environment
[1:15:39.120 --> 1:15:45.360]  which is why i am convinced that the u.s government is headed for extinction by its own hands but
[1:15:45.360 --> 1:15:50.320]  that's the globalist plan the big banks sit offshore they use the u.s to carry this out they
[1:15:50.320 --> 1:15:56.800]  get us deep in debt then they scapegoat us for everything in the end well i don't think we're
[1:15:56.800 --> 1:16:02.000]  talking about exactly the same mechanism i i think the u.s might implode before those plans
[1:16:02.000 --> 1:16:07.600]  can even come to fruition but the bottom line is when the u.s goes down i think it's probably
[1:16:07.600 --> 1:16:13.040]  going to take a big chunk of the globalism with it because so many of the globalists were using
[1:16:13.040 --> 1:16:20.160]  the u.s as a foundation at least to launch the swine flu pandemic hoax um and the economic
[1:16:20.720 --> 1:16:24.800]  hoax you were talking about the banks are calling for a new global financial authority
[1:16:24.800 --> 1:16:29.600]  which we knew was going to be the third pillar for the foundation of global government but all
[1:16:29.600 --> 1:16:34.080]  three pillars are in serious serious trouble and i think that if the united states government and
[1:16:34.080 --> 1:16:39.040]  economy implodes that third pillar is going to get dragged down with it and the globalists are
[1:16:39.040 --> 1:16:42.960]  going to have nothing that they can use to trick the people into going along with the global
[1:16:42.960 --> 1:16:47.360]  government they can sit up there and say we're the global government but if five billion human
[1:16:47.360 --> 1:16:53.040]  beings six billion human beings sit there and say i'm not going along with it they do not have the
[1:16:53.040 --> 1:16:58.640]  military force to literally conquer the entire planet and rule it from a single golden pyramid
[1:16:58.640 --> 1:17:03.680]  somewhere well i agree with you and almost all the economists and historians we have on say
[1:17:03.680 --> 1:17:09.120]  that the new world order has overplayed their hand that everything is starting to really crumble for
[1:17:09.120 --> 1:17:15.920]  them and that when the dollar goes it's going to suck all the other major currencies right along
[1:17:15.920 --> 1:17:22.400]  with it and then when the banks try to finagle a whole new plan to give them even more power
[1:17:22.400 --> 1:17:27.120]  out of the crisis they created that they're just going to get arrested because we've done our job
[1:17:27.120 --> 1:17:31.680]  in the previous decades of identifying them and breaking down the global government and breaking
[1:17:31.680 --> 1:17:36.960]  down who they are they tried to just black ball us and ignore us and call us conspiracy terrorists
[1:17:36.960 --> 1:17:42.560]  but now that everything we said came true the public's taking it like some form of revelation
[1:17:42.560 --> 1:17:48.000]  it's not some form of revelation we're not staring into a reflecting pool or looking into a misty
[1:17:48.000 --> 1:17:53.760]  you know uh crystal ball we read what they said they would do we went out not caring if we got
[1:17:53.760 --> 1:18:00.240]  attacked to tell the truth and it's literally the equivalent of billions of time bombs in people's
[1:18:00.240 --> 1:18:06.160]  brains that as things get worse they remember everything we told them that's exactly right i'm
[1:18:06.160 --> 1:18:11.360]  flooded with emails saying i thought you were a loon five years ago but obviously you're correct
[1:18:11.360 --> 1:18:17.120]  everything that you predicted and warned about was coming about right now the the climate gate
[1:18:17.120 --> 1:18:23.200]  pillar and the swine flu pillar are in absolute ruins and this financial push this quest to create
[1:18:23.200 --> 1:18:28.960]  a global reserve bank is falling apart because most of the world sees economic globalism as the
[1:18:28.960 --> 1:18:35.200]  reason that a us downturned in turned into a global calamity they're not going to see globalism
[1:18:35.200 --> 1:18:40.800]  as a a solution to problems created by globalism it's like taking the titanic backing up and
[1:18:40.800 --> 1:18:45.520]  whacking the iceberg on the other side just to see if maybe that fixes the leak most people
[1:18:45.520 --> 1:18:50.000]  understand that really isn't going to work i think most people are beginning to see the
[1:18:50.000 --> 1:18:55.360]  past the idea of a single global government as a problem and they see the return to small
[1:18:55.360 --> 1:19:00.960]  regional communities thousands of them across as the answer as the answer all right let's go back
[1:19:02.400 --> 1:19:07.920]  the arrogance of these people we get the Copenhagen treaty two days into the two-week conference
[1:19:07.920 --> 1:19:14.960]  it's worse than we even thought literally hundreds of new taxes right at double the carbon cuts for
[1:19:14.960 --> 1:19:19.680]  the third world they'd lie to the third world and said look i know you don't like the imf world bank
[1:19:19.680 --> 1:19:24.080]  you know we robbed you we promise we're going to give you a bunch of free money from the evil
[1:19:24.080 --> 1:19:30.720]  americans and europeans and british and australians then they read the treaty and it rapes the west
[1:19:30.720 --> 1:19:36.640]  but also rapes them even worse i mean how did the bankers think they could i mean it's just

[1:24:29.120 --> 1:24:32.960]  talk about the fact that it doesn't matter if the congress has said no
[1:24:34.000 --> 1:24:39.360]  doesn't matter if the cap and trade bill is dead the city where i live they've announced 2.6
[1:24:39.360 --> 1:24:43.920]  billion dollars within the first three years of this starting next year they're trying to pass it
[1:24:43.920 --> 1:24:50.880]  later this month or early in march and the federal government and you in openly run it home inspections
[1:24:50.880 --> 1:24:57.600]  taxes on everything doubling on your energy prices i mean just raping the likes of which
[1:24:57.600 --> 1:25:01.600]  the world has never seen we're going to be talking about that with mike revero but let's go to john
[1:25:01.600 --> 1:25:07.200]  in new york first john you're on the air go ahead hey alex uh i wish i just want to say
[1:25:07.200 --> 1:25:13.120]  i completely agree with everything that mike had said there especially about uh us going down the
[1:25:13.120 --> 1:25:19.040]  same road as uh nazi germany because i i think hitler was basically an evil an evil pinocchio
[1:25:19.040 --> 1:25:25.280]  controlled by rockefeller in the broth trial then uh and uh bushes uh great grandfather prescott
[1:25:25.280 --> 1:25:29.280]  actually you know we used to cover that when it was in the london guardian in bbc and people
[1:25:29.280 --> 1:25:34.400]  wouldn't believe us but now i mean even oliver stones making a film about it but he doesn't
[1:25:34.400 --> 1:25:38.640]  tell you the communists were also funded by this but if you read carol quigley's book
[1:25:38.640 --> 1:25:41.760]  who was allowed into the annals of the new world order this was the head of georgetown
[1:25:41.760 --> 1:25:48.000]  political science bill clinton's mentor he explains the public wants choices so we give them fascism
[1:25:48.000 --> 1:25:53.760]  or communism and the different variants of those when it's all black uniforms secret police high
[1:25:53.760 --> 1:26:02.320]  taxes ultra elites mike revero choices were being given whether it's fascism versus communism or
[1:26:02.320 --> 1:26:07.840]  republican versus democrat it's all an illusion designed to sell us the same agenda which is
[1:26:07.840 --> 1:26:13.040]  complete control of our lives the looting of the population of the the sub-burning of individuals
[1:26:13.040 --> 1:26:18.320]  to the will of the state constant war to grind up work product to keep us all under control
[1:26:18.320 --> 1:26:23.440]  and it is the same and it's the same thing we don't really have a choice until we choose to stand up
[1:26:23.440 --> 1:26:28.960]  and say no and one of the points that i'm hitting at my website and my radio show these days is
[1:26:28.960 --> 1:26:34.240]  we don't have any freedom until we have the freedom to say no and we'd better get that one back
[1:26:34.800 --> 1:26:40.960]  or anything else john well yeah i agree you know i totally agree with that and i think that the
[1:26:40.960 --> 1:26:45.600]  time is now i i mean i hear you say alex you know about the next election and this and that
[1:26:45.600 --> 1:26:50.400]  and uh honestly we don't have much control in the election anyway if we do happen to get somebody
[1:26:50.400 --> 1:26:53.680]  in there that's good they'll just take them out anyway we've seen that done with kennedy i mean
[1:26:53.680 --> 1:26:58.800]  it's no way it's not if it's at the uh i hear you but not of it not if it's at the state level
[1:26:58.800 --> 1:27:04.160]  not if it's an idea ideas are bulletproof as v for vendetta says so well they're eternal
[1:27:04.880 --> 1:27:12.000]  and so if you simply continue to tell the truth can sunshine is what beats these people banner
[1:27:12.000 --> 1:27:18.320]  hangs websites radio shows information we're telling the truth and if we just set the truth
[1:27:18.320 --> 1:27:22.720]  up against the lie we're going to win every time micro vero yeah you're absolutely right
[1:27:22.720 --> 1:27:27.840]  we're beginning to see the states uh starting to pull away from the federal government we're
[1:27:27.840 --> 1:27:32.480]  seeing the emergence of more and more secession movements we're seeing people talk about breaking
[1:27:32.480 --> 1:27:38.240]  off informing their own country and i think that's a good direction to go i i think at this point
[1:27:38.240 --> 1:27:43.120]  hardly anybody sees a reason to continue with the federal government they're taking all of our money
[1:27:43.120 --> 1:27:48.960]  they're giving nothing back uh obama's new budget puts us on a wartime footing he's freezing domestic
[1:27:48.960 --> 1:27:52.960]  spending which is a polite way of saying sorry we gave all your tax money to the banks we've
[1:27:52.960 --> 1:27:58.000]  got nothing left over to spend on you and we need the rest of this pile of money to buy bombs and
[1:27:58.000 --> 1:28:02.240]  stuff and so everybody out in america is saying well why do i need this why do i need to spend
[1:28:02.240 --> 1:28:07.840]  the rest well let me say this about secession i am for tenth amendment ninth amendment declarations
[1:28:07.840 --> 1:28:13.760]  the states form the federal government they are the boss uh the globalist and some of their game
[1:28:13.760 --> 1:28:18.880]  plans do plan to break off the southwest into an enclave as part of the north american union
[1:28:18.880 --> 1:28:25.600]  that's in their own documents it's on record from the spp and cfr but at the same time if your
[1:28:25.600 --> 1:28:31.200]  country's been conquered by offshore financial interest the only way to get it back is to have
[1:28:31.200 --> 1:28:38.080]  people remove themselves and then reconstitute it absolutely and uh you know we need to basically
[1:28:38.080 --> 1:28:44.000]  get back to the constitution as it originally was which includes no private central bank uh in
[1:28:44.000 --> 1:28:50.560]  1913 is when the conquest of america truly began and it's been proceeding very very slowly now we're
[1:28:50.560 --> 1:28:54.800]  in a race they're trying to complete their designs before the rest of america wakes up to what's going
[1:28:54.800 --> 1:29:00.080]  on yeah i mean they captured the u.s a long time ago as an engine of tyranny but but now
[1:29:00.080 --> 1:29:06.240]  they're really trying to further exploit us and bring us into a high tech form of enslavement
[1:29:06.240 --> 1:29:13.760]  and uh to to to try to use up the rest of our energy and our sustenance our substance in
[1:29:13.760 --> 1:29:20.000]  their overall conquest and i just isn't going well for them which which i'm glad about but also
[1:29:20.000 --> 1:29:24.800]  it's kind of scary that everything they're doing is falling apart but they don't care they just
[1:29:24.800 --> 1:29:29.600]  roll forward mike they're addicted to our money that's the problem we need an intervention
[1:29:29.600 --> 1:29:36.480]  i mean it's like an employee or a boss or an alcoholic husband or wife somebody who you just
[1:29:36.480 --> 1:29:43.120]  who won't stop and you're so amazed by what they do but this alcoholic husband or wife has
[1:29:43.120 --> 1:29:47.520]  men in black uniforms with machine guns that work for them who are ready to kill whoever they're told

[1:35:28.640 --> 1:35:33.040]  is our guest right now and i want to go over some twitter questions for you mike briefly and then
[1:35:33.040 --> 1:35:38.320]  i'm going to go back to the calls it says hey alex my question this is from our new twitter account
[1:35:38.320 --> 1:35:44.880]  twitter.com forward slash real alex jones you could sign up there folks it says hey alex my question
[1:35:44.880 --> 1:35:50.080]  is do you think our military will stay in Haiti to take over the country and and and my answer that
[1:35:50.080 --> 1:35:55.760]  that's a question to me but i'll also ask it to mike is that the the globalist have controlled
[1:35:55.760 --> 1:35:59.840]  Haiti for more than 50 years well we had troops going there like a what a hundred years ago
[1:35:59.840 --> 1:36:05.200]  was it 1903 and then 1908 and there's been so many invasions that country's already run
[1:36:06.240 --> 1:36:14.800]  by the west but certainly george bush senior and clinton and george w bush you know
[1:36:14.800 --> 1:36:18.240]  they've been caught promoting charities that keep the most the money for themselves
[1:36:18.240 --> 1:36:24.720]  mike what's your take on Haiti well definitely Haiti is a source of of rich mineral wealth and
[1:36:24.720 --> 1:36:31.200]  my opinion is the united states government rather than risk the return of aris steed uh had a plan
[1:36:31.200 --> 1:36:36.080]  already in place to go into Haiti after the next natural disaster like a hurricane we know they
[1:36:36.080 --> 1:36:41.360]  did i mean that came out the day before they had a hurricane takeover drill and uh yeah absolutely
[1:36:41.360 --> 1:36:45.840]  so when the quake happened they just basically implemented the plan they went in there i mean
[1:36:45.840 --> 1:36:51.680]  we were our troops were in Haiti in 2004 shooting the Haitian people and so it's hardly surprising
[1:36:51.680 --> 1:36:55.760]  that the Haitians have been very uncomfortable with the return of the americans but it's very
[1:36:55.760 --> 1:37:00.480]  clear i mean for every dollar that the u.s government claims they're spending on Haitian relief
[1:37:00.480 --> 1:37:05.120]  only one penny actually gets to the Haitian people the rest is going for all this military
[1:37:05.120 --> 1:37:10.000]  build-up and military hardware they've cordoned off the area they're in complete control of the
[1:37:10.000 --> 1:37:15.200]  airfields from the people on the ground it's kind of hard to say that this doesn't look like another
[1:37:15.200 --> 1:37:20.880]  invasion mike what do you think the timeline another question of the internet censorship
[1:37:20.880 --> 1:37:27.600]  is greetings from the netherlands i think that the united nations in the united states and
[1:37:27.600 --> 1:37:32.080]  certainly israel are trying to figure out some way they can sell the necessity of internet
[1:37:32.080 --> 1:37:37.200]  censorship to the world uh they want to keep that part of the internet that allows for government
[1:37:37.200 --> 1:37:41.760]  propaganda and the megaphones to do what they're doing obviously a lot of commerce currently
[1:37:41.760 --> 1:37:46.160]  depends on the u.n says they're gonna allow who they want to be on the web and shut everybody
[1:37:46.160 --> 1:37:51.360]  else off they're actually now saying it yeah absolutely and it's a reaction to the fact
[1:37:51.360 --> 1:37:57.440]  that we defeated them at Copenhagen they up until and the swine flew the internet exposed that now
[1:37:57.440 --> 1:38:03.280]  there's criminal investigations and uh yeah and so basically what they're finally waking up to is
[1:38:03.280 --> 1:38:10.080]  what you and i have known for the last 12 14 15 years the government of the of the nation the
[1:38:10.080 --> 1:38:16.320]  government of the world as it as it sees itself has lost the ability to successfully lie to the
[1:38:16.320 --> 1:38:22.160]  population and to be believed and they were full of yours before mike they were full of hubris before
[1:38:22.160 --> 1:38:27.040]  we've always warned about the point when they finally figure out they're in trouble that's when
[1:38:27.040 --> 1:38:32.000]  they're dangerous yeah and that we've reached that point and all of this talk about internet
[1:38:32.000 --> 1:38:37.600]  censorship uh... coming up now is a knee jerk response to the fact that they didn't get their
[1:38:37.600 --> 1:38:42.160]  way at Copenhagen uh... you know governments around the world the u.s government the reason
[1:38:42.160 --> 1:38:48.000]  obama is doing all this executive order stuff the u.s government actually counted on getting these
[1:38:48.000 --> 1:38:52.720]  carbon taxes to refill their coffers and they didn't get it from Copenhagen and that's when all
[1:38:52.720 --> 1:38:57.040]  of a sudden they started talking about executive order now and now island saying no to pay the
[1:38:57.040 --> 1:39:02.400]  bankers that robbed them i mean people are really waking up yeah and and what they're waking up to
[1:39:02.400 --> 1:39:08.240]  is a very simple concept you know we don't really have money in this country anymore it's just pretty
[1:39:08.240 --> 1:39:14.160]  pieces of printed paper and as long as we believe that that has worth then we're we're basically
[1:39:14.160 --> 1:39:18.480]  gonna fall into the trap that they've set for us you know with this legalized counterfeiting ring
[1:39:18.480 --> 1:39:24.080]  now china is complaining that the gold bars coming out of fort nox are as fake as our quarters and
[1:39:24.080 --> 1:39:29.040]  dimes in our federal reserve notes so this is a scandal that is really beginning to catch on
[1:39:29.040 --> 1:39:34.320]  people are realizing there isn't really any money coming from the government it's all this fake
[1:39:34.320 --> 1:39:38.960]  paper that we're supposed to believe has power over our lives and they're beginning to say
[1:39:38.960 --> 1:39:43.360]  i'd you know i don't need this i reject these federal reserve notes i'm gonna just do business
[1:39:43.360 --> 1:39:49.520]  with my neighbors for whatever we have that we agree is mutually valuable and i think it really
[1:39:49.520 --> 1:39:55.280]  works we're thinking about getting back to the constitutional definition of money where the
[1:39:55.280 --> 1:40:01.040]  money has intrinsic value so that you can depend on it and it cannot be manipulated by the government
[1:40:01.040 --> 1:40:05.760]  and so yeah i think we're seeing a whole rejection of global banking global reserve
[1:40:05.760 --> 1:40:11.440]  the reserve banking system itself people are waking up to the fact that by design a reserve
[1:40:11.440 --> 1:40:16.480]  banking system means that more money is owed to the private bankers than is ever actually in
[1:40:16.480 --> 1:40:21.760]  existence and it's made up money shifting gears again suddenly michael savages coming out and
[1:40:21.760 --> 1:40:28.080]  saying obama may stage terror attacks bloomberg maybe a secret banking cabal does run the world
[1:40:28.080 --> 1:40:35.200]  after all i mean we are seeing just so much of this admitted perhaps the collapse of the globalist
[1:40:35.200 --> 1:40:40.400]  is even worse than we even realize and and and perhaps the biggest stumbling block to this
[1:40:40.400 --> 1:40:48.320]  is that the christian church and i'm christian has accepted and bought into the fact that evil is
[1:40:48.320 --> 1:40:52.720]  a foregone conclusion that you know they thought hitler was the antichrist they thought stallin
[1:40:52.720 --> 1:40:57.040]  was the antichrist they thought poll pot was the antichrist the tootsies being killed by the
[1:40:57.040 --> 1:41:02.880]  hutus and rwanda thought it was the end of the world and that that foregone conclusion idea
[1:41:02.880 --> 1:41:07.040]  that we're just supposed to give into the naked body scanners and give into the corruption i mean
[1:41:07.040 --> 1:41:12.400]  even if you believe that the antichrist is coming and all this is true what about neneva and the
[1:41:12.400 --> 1:41:18.960]  hundred year reprieve and and and and jonah i mean we have a responsibility to fight evil
[1:41:18.960 --> 1:41:24.160]  and we're routing these people but still most the general public says i'm christian it's the end of
[1:41:24.160 --> 1:41:30.720]  the world and i'm not i'm gonna sit here on my fat butt yeah that is definitely an aspect of our
[1:41:30.720 --> 1:41:36.960]  society that has been successfully exploited not only by our own government um but even by israel
[1:41:36.960 --> 1:41:42.560]  which is trying to convince american christians that if they help israel start world war three
[1:41:42.560 --> 1:41:46.960]  in the middle east that after it's all over jesus is going to come down and invite everybody up to
[1:41:46.960 --> 1:41:53.280]  the big house and even sarah palin the particular church she goes to uh actually argues that its
[1:41:53.280 --> 1:41:58.400]  members should actively seek to bring about the end of the world in order to bring jesus back for
[1:41:58.400 --> 1:42:03.600]  the second coming now i don't care what reason they think they want to do it i'm opposed to anybody
[1:42:03.600 --> 1:42:09.200]  who wants to blow up the planet for whatever reason now we gotta keep her away from the nukes
[1:42:09.200 --> 1:42:13.280]  yeah we we absolutely do and the fact that they're saying she's the front runner for the g.o.p
[1:42:13.280 --> 1:42:19.280]  nomination in 2012 i think is very worrying because obama might actually be a one-term president
[1:42:19.280 --> 1:42:24.480]  and things that definitely get worse with caribou barbie in the white house well we see them setting
[1:42:24.480 --> 1:42:30.560]  we see them setting her up uh first they built her up destroyed her i believe they're building her up
[1:42:30.560 --> 1:42:35.760]  to destroy her so obama gets back in and that's why they're selling her to all the tea parties
[1:42:35.760 --> 1:42:42.720]  we do not want sarah palin she was mccain's pick i mean come on folks what does that tell you about
[1:42:42.720 --> 1:42:49.040]  her yeah it absolutely she's a manufactured candidate and frankly she does not impress me with
[1:42:49.040 --> 1:42:55.040]  her intelligence or her awareness of foreign policy issues and it's absolutely it's a joke
[1:42:55.040 --> 1:43:00.000]  it's it really is a joke of the american political system but getting back to this issue about
[1:43:00.000 --> 1:43:05.200]  our future and fighting evil now obviously you and i have very different belief systems around
[1:43:05.200 --> 1:43:11.040]  you know in in terms of of the universe my personal opinion is heaven in hell is right here on earth
[1:43:11.040 --> 1:43:16.880]  and it's what we choose to make of the world and so i'm not going to just sit on my rear and wait
[1:43:16.880 --> 1:43:22.480]  for the you know for my death to this fight figure out which way i'm going if i want a heaven i have
[1:43:22.480 --> 1:43:28.560]  to build it right here on earth and that is my reason for opposing evil for opposing nuclear war
[1:43:28.560 --> 1:43:34.560]  for opposing the addiction of greed that infects the ruling classes of the entire planet everybody
[1:43:34.560 --> 1:43:40.160]  talks about globalism maybe we're on the verge of a global revolution where the people of every
[1:43:40.160 --> 1:43:45.760]  nation unite together and kick out the oligarchs universally all at the same time that would be
[1:43:45.760 --> 1:43:53.600]  something to see all right let's uh go to some phone calls here let's talk to uh julio in
[1:43:53.600 --> 1:44:00.080]  illinois julio go ahead alex jones freedom fighter how are you aloha microvera from the
[1:44:00.080 --> 1:44:06.080]  land of lincoln here in the mainland um i mentioned this alex on your show last week but i i couldn't
[1:44:06.080 --> 1:44:10.400]  get to the full point of what i was trying to make we all know about the bankers we all seem
[1:44:10.400 --> 1:44:15.040]  to follow the republic and the obama deception knowing the cabinet i've been exposing the new
[1:44:15.040 --> 1:44:20.960]  order to my roommates and now they understand that turbo tax geithner and the man of the year
[1:44:20.960 --> 1:44:27.040]  ben Bernanke are the real uh architects of this uh global depression going on in this country
[1:44:27.600 --> 1:44:32.800]  we have three months april 15th i want to give you thoughts on this it's tax day it's a thursday
[1:44:32.800 --> 1:44:39.120]  a march on wall street we all protest peacefully of course like gondy and martin luther king
[1:44:39.120 --> 1:44:45.920]  have uh done so well and you know we expose the bankers to the entire country on tax day
[1:44:45.920 --> 1:44:50.240]  and you know we have speeches we have signed you know talking about what's really going on
[1:44:50.240 --> 1:44:55.520]  and we can we could sign petitions you know posterizes all over the internet since we don't
[1:44:55.520 --> 1:45:00.720]  have much time with net censorship and yahoo selling off our searches to the government
[1:45:00.720 --> 1:45:06.240]  itself what what are your guys thoughts i appreciate your call illio and that is basically
[1:45:06.240 --> 1:45:10.960]  what you said last week i mean uh yeah we need to get the tea parties to actually identify the
[1:45:10.960 --> 1:45:17.120]  bankers instead the tea parties are all attacking obama who is the birdcage liner i mean he's bad
[1:45:17.120 --> 1:45:23.440]  but once he was shot down politically as a messianic savior he is in his dangerous now
[1:45:23.440 --> 1:45:28.160]  the military industrial complex owned by the banks that's what's dangerous that may stage a terror
[1:45:28.160 --> 1:45:33.600]  attack uh but micro vero comment on what julio said well basically uh something that we're talking
[1:45:33.600 --> 1:45:38.720]  about over at my radio show on our website is there is a call for a four-day national strike
[1:45:39.440 --> 1:45:43.840]  commencing on tax day and going through the weekend and if we were to do that at the same
[1:45:43.840 --> 1:45:49.360]  time with the protest i think it's going to carry far more impact than petitions in a nation with
[1:45:49.360 --> 1:45:55.360]  massive national vote fraud petitions don't carry any impact anymore yeah i agree we need we need to
[1:45:55.360 --> 1:46:03.520]  have a strike uh on april 15 to all the new taxes and garbage saying no we need people to go into
[1:46:03.520 --> 1:46:07.920]  all the cities where they're passing carbon taxes even though it's all been proven to be a fraud
[1:46:07.920 --> 1:46:15.280]  and a lie and a robbery by the banks and so don't just not go to work on april 15th go out everywhere
[1:46:15.280 --> 1:46:21.520]  and protest and demonstrate at the post office at the state house at wall street in front of
[1:46:21.520 --> 1:46:26.000]  jp morgan chase in front of goldman sacks great idea now now listen i gotta move quick now
[1:46:26.000 --> 1:46:31.600]  to the calls jeff in texas you're on the air go ahead yeah hi alex i think i've identified one of
[1:46:31.600 --> 1:46:36.160]  the enemy super star destroyers and this comes on the heels of your interview with george hunt
[1:46:36.160 --> 1:46:42.800]  about the world conservation bank yes yeah and i actually called michael reverell on this on friday
[1:46:42.800 --> 1:46:48.480]  but i have a follow-up uh this is the global environment facility and it claims to be the
[1:46:48.480 --> 1:46:54.400]  largest funder of projects to improve the global environment it's an independent financial
[1:46:54.400 --> 1:47:00.400]  organization and it moves massive amounts of first world dollars yeah all the big central banks
[1:47:00.400 --> 1:47:06.080]  kick into it and a few other holding companies yes yeah well it's got members on its council
[1:47:06.080 --> 1:47:10.640]  that are actually sitting members of the treasury department and i think you need to get somebody
[1:47:10.640 --> 1:47:16.640]  like a paul craig roberts or yeah paulson gives something like 10 of his money to it well we
[1:47:16.640 --> 1:47:21.520]  need i think there's a lawsuit here you can't have a sitting senior member of the treasury department
[1:47:21.520 --> 1:47:27.680]  also sitting on the board of a foreign bank i agree with you why don't you and i'm aware of what you
[1:47:27.680 --> 1:47:34.480]  say but i've never properly articulated it i guess hunt did you need to write an article with the names
[1:47:34.480 --> 1:47:40.480]  and the facts and send it to writers and info wars dot com and i am aware of that we we have covered
[1:47:40.480 --> 1:47:46.000]  it but we need it in print so i mean but if this is all illegal it's illegal to have paulson give
[1:47:46.000 --> 1:47:52.880]  himself 210 million dollars of the bailout money directly to himself and congressman stern says how
[1:47:52.880 --> 1:47:58.000]  do you do that who gave you a waiver to do that and paulson says the treasury department gave me
[1:47:58.000 --> 1:48:03.680]  a waiver he was the head of the treasury that'd be like if if i was a bank manager and i robbed
[1:48:03.680 --> 1:48:09.920]  the bank and i said but i gave myself a waiver i would be thrown into irons um anything else jeff
[1:48:10.720 --> 1:48:14.960]  need to blow this thing wide open because if you look at their annual report and their stated history
[1:48:14.960 --> 1:48:20.560]  you cannot tell who started this thing well that's really the world conservation bank give people the
[1:48:20.560 --> 1:48:27.920]  name again yeah it's the g e f dot org is the website and it's the global environment facility
[1:48:27.920 --> 1:48:34.080]  yep all right appreciate your call i mean it's amazing folks what's going on again the green
[1:48:34.080 --> 1:48:39.680]  tyranny is their way of taking over control of all facets of our lives tito in canada you're on the
[1:48:39.680 --> 1:48:46.080]  year hey how you guys doing good thanks for taking my call here just about to get head into the
[1:48:46.080 --> 1:48:52.080]  olympic as a helicopter flies overhead you know just keeping everything safe anyways i just i
[1:48:52.080 --> 1:48:58.560]  haven't heard you talk about the um slow back security uh mistake earlier in the year and it
[1:48:58.560 --> 1:49:02.480]  was made because i missed your show but i want to know if you're aware about it and touched upon it
[1:49:02.480 --> 1:49:11.200]  on your show uh refresh my memory well earlier in the year january sixth i believe um as a security
[1:49:11.200 --> 1:49:16.720]  drill in the slow back airport yeah they nailed the they they put the bomb in the guy's luggage
[1:49:17.360 --> 1:49:24.000]  they put the bomb not only the guy's luggage and he flew unwittingly to ireland to dublin but they
[1:49:24.000 --> 1:49:30.560]  once they realized that they didn't inform the irish authorities for three days and when they did
[1:49:30.560 --> 1:49:36.320]  they initially tried to deny that they had any part of it so the guy yeah we did cover that at
[1:49:36.320 --> 1:49:42.400]  the time and that looks like a box a botched falls flag microvaro yeah absolutely it you know every
[1:49:42.400 --> 1:49:47.200]  time we see this stuff being planted what what it is is all of this security infrastructure we talk
[1:49:47.200 --> 1:49:52.000]  about the military industrial complex well the complexes are continually changing and now there's
[1:49:52.000 --> 1:49:57.520]  the security media complex that hypes the terror threat so that the security companies can make
[1:49:57.520 --> 1:50:02.960]  money but if they don't actually have a security threat every once in a while people start saying
[1:50:02.960 --> 1:50:08.080]  why are we spending all this money why are we here's a barrel here's a parallel i mean there was a
[1:50:08.080 --> 1:50:13.360]  famous case what a decade ago in new york where the guy owned the only windshield repair shop in
[1:50:13.360 --> 1:50:18.560]  a wide area and he was caught bashing out windshields at night with a ball peen hammer
[1:50:18.560 --> 1:50:24.480]  that he would then fix in the morning at his local uh office uh local repair shops uh or
[1:50:25.440 --> 1:50:30.480]  it's well known that big virus antivirus companies are funding putting out viruses
[1:50:30.480 --> 1:50:35.520]  i mean it it it's very very simple it's like the mafia threatening to burn down your grocery store
[1:50:35.520 --> 1:50:43.040]  if you don't buy protection from them yeah it's it it's very very very similar all right appreciate

[1:54:04.160 --> 1:54:17.760]  we've got a member of the british parliament joining us the british government wants to
[1:54:17.760 --> 1:54:23.680]  eradicate the family that's stated policy it's in major textbooks here in the us and in england
[1:54:23.680 --> 1:54:29.040]  and europe and now they're doing it 20 000 homes when the child is born they say you must have
[1:54:29.040 --> 1:54:33.600]  cameras in the house to watch you to make sure you're not a bad parent but then the government
[1:54:33.600 --> 1:54:38.800]  who abuses children that's okay leave them alone well now if you have a learning disability
[1:54:39.760 --> 1:54:45.440]  and you have a child they take it i mean this is hard core tyranny again hitler was obsessed
[1:54:45.440 --> 1:54:51.680]  with taking people's children the soviets were obsessed north korea we've played documentary
[1:54:51.680 --> 1:54:57.600]  clips here where large portions of the population live in work camps prison camps and they put them
[1:54:57.600 --> 1:55:03.440]  for five days a year men and women together to have a baby and then it's taken like eggs
[1:55:03.440 --> 1:55:08.320]  from a hen and raised by the state so there is no family i mean this is really happening
[1:55:08.320 --> 1:55:14.320]  mike revero your take on that yeah absolutely the the government is basically stepping in and
[1:55:14.320 --> 1:55:19.600]  treating us like we're a herd of of crop animals if you will and as you say they're breeding us
[1:55:19.600 --> 1:55:24.320]  they're taking the children away because the the state is presuming the right to brainwash the
[1:55:24.320 --> 1:55:29.520]  children to be servants of the state in the future it's exactly what we saw under the soviet union
[1:55:29.520 --> 1:55:34.480]  nazi germany and now they're bringing it to the united states as well this is why there's this
[1:55:34.480 --> 1:55:40.400]  ongoing campaign against homeschooling they don't want the parents to be telling the kids anything
[1:55:40.400 --> 1:55:46.640]  that contradicts the will of the state on another subject what do you think of shavez saying he
[1:55:46.640 --> 1:55:51.440]  knows it's an earthquake weapon and the russians told him so we know they have tectonic weapons
[1:55:51.440 --> 1:55:56.960]  secretary cohen of defense talked about it in the late nineties but i mean i mean the shavez
[1:55:56.960 --> 1:56:03.680]  going crazy how can he just say it with no proof my understanding is that that story was debunked
[1:56:03.680 --> 1:56:08.160]  as being another hoax along the same lines as when they were claiming i'm a dina shod said he was
[1:56:08.160 --> 1:56:14.400]  going to wipe israel off the map that shavez did not actually say that uh it's just somebody took
[1:56:14.400 --> 1:56:19.520]  a guess at it and the story got picked up but i believe that shavez has denied actually saying
[1:56:19.520 --> 1:56:25.120]  that now it was in one of the big state run newspapers that we first saw it well so was
[1:56:25.120 --> 1:56:29.280]  uh so was the claim that i'm a dina shod was going to wipe iran or israel off the map
[1:56:30.480 --> 1:56:34.400]  and what he really said is we're going to push we're going to push that government into the sea
[1:56:35.760 --> 1:56:41.280]  actually what i'm a dina shod said is uh the government of israel must vanish from the pages
[1:56:41.280 --> 1:56:47.040]  of history which is not quite the same thing yeah that's one of the quotes um i mean that's like
[1:56:47.680 --> 1:56:52.800]  under the un agreement which they're not even signatories to but they've been letting the un
[1:56:52.800 --> 1:56:56.960]  in they're supposed to tell the world six months before they open a new facility before enrichment
[1:56:56.960 --> 1:57:02.000]  starts they do that and they say oh my god we found a secret base and it was on record that
[1:57:02.000 --> 1:57:07.760]  i ran announced it i mean it's just the level but i even get fooled by it sometimes mike remember
[1:57:07.760 --> 1:57:14.000]  back on 888 in 2008 i get up at seven in the morning i turned the news on the phone's ringing
[1:57:14.000 --> 1:57:19.920]  seeing ends uh got uh the leader of georgia on saying we've been snuck attacked by russia help us
[1:57:19.920 --> 1:57:26.720]  were under attack and this went on for three hours i got into the radio show and went wait a minute
[1:57:26.720 --> 1:57:31.120]  and people are saying alex no it is it is russia attacking i'm like wait a minute even the european
[1:57:31.120 --> 1:57:37.920]  news says georgia attacked them i mean it's just the magnitude of lying and then nobody gets in
[1:57:37.920 --> 1:57:44.640]  trouble yeah that's absolutely the the case here the the corporate media just echoes what the government
[1:57:44.640 --> 1:57:52.000]  tells them to say and as that fox news synthetic bovine growth hormone lawsuit proved there is no
[1:57:52.000 --> 1:57:57.280]  law that requires the corporate media to tell the truth the american people they can lie with impunity
[1:57:57.280 --> 1:58:02.560]  the the corporate leadership can actually fire reporters who refuse to lie when ordered to do so
[1:58:02.560 --> 1:58:07.200]  that was the president set in this case and the bottom line is they can say whatever they want
[1:58:07.200 --> 1:58:11.840]  and absent of malice they cannot be sued or punished in any way it is legal to lie to the
[1:58:11.840 --> 1:58:17.200]  american people for the media and for politicians but monsanto was forced to sell that division
[1:58:17.200 --> 1:58:22.240]  and most milk doesn't have anything uh in it now when most milk did previously the only country in
[1:58:22.240 --> 1:58:27.840]  the world to accept it was the us so in the end the truth did come out yes it did as it always
[1:58:27.840 --> 1:58:34.080]  does for for uh synthetic hormones msg aspartame because of the internet which is why they want
[1:58:34.080 --> 1:58:38.640]  to start raining it in and shutting it down so we've got to stand up and say no and defeat that
[1:58:38.640 --> 1:58:47.520]  takeover as well thank you mind with arrow thank you for listening to gcn be sure to visit gcn

[1:58:54.400 --> 1:58:59.360]  power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric
[1:58:59.360 --> 1:59:04.400]  bill number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company
[1:59:04.400 --> 1:59:09.760]  allows you to have it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid

[2:00:13.120 --> 2:00:30.320]  see he's alex jones on the gcm radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[2:00:30.320 --> 2:00:46.240]  okay john hemming is a member of parliament in the united kingdom
[2:00:47.280 --> 2:00:52.720]  and we saw his name in an article from the mail online it's been in all the other big papers we've
[2:00:52.720 --> 2:00:59.040]  seen mother not clever enough to raise child has babies snatched by social workers after running
[2:00:59.040 --> 2:01:05.120]  away to iran to give birth no criminal record hasn't done anything wrong her and her husband are
[2:01:05.120 --> 2:01:09.120]  going to have the baby and because she had a learning disability in school and i've seen
[2:01:09.120 --> 2:01:14.720]  her on the news she's well spoken they just say you can't have your child like george arwell said
[2:01:14.720 --> 2:01:20.400]  in the future there will be no families we will take your children as if we take the eggs from
[2:01:20.400 --> 2:01:24.960]  a hen now he's got to go to a way to a votes anytime he may leave and he'll be back in about
[2:01:24.960 --> 2:01:29.760]  10 minutes he's with us for the rest of the hour but just like we have a congressman on
[2:01:29.760 --> 2:01:34.160]  sometimes they've got to run off and vote but this is an amazing case but i look at the
[2:01:34.160 --> 2:01:39.440]  video cameras being put in newborns homes i mean this is right out of 1984 is it not sir
[2:01:40.080 --> 2:01:45.760]  what's more brave new world rather than 1984 although there's elements of 1984 in the ministries
[2:01:45.760 --> 2:01:50.640]  of truth things like that well we'll break down the basics of what's happening here
[2:01:50.640 --> 2:01:58.560]  um this is a case from five and what it appears to be is that because the mother was um herself
[2:01:58.560 --> 2:02:06.240]  at some stage in in care of the state they thought here's a baby we can take um and get adopted and
[2:02:06.240 --> 2:02:10.720]  they thought well you know we've got to stop her getting married so we'll prevent her getting
[2:02:10.720 --> 2:02:17.200]  married by um saying she's too stupid to get married and then uh we'll we'll take her baby at
[2:02:17.200 --> 2:02:24.000]  birth so they did a runner to ireland which is a more pro family country in practice um there was
[2:02:24.000 --> 2:02:29.200]  a difficulty because they ended up in a rush in ireland and five then jumped up and down said this
[2:02:29.200 --> 2:02:34.240]  woman's dreadful she's evil she's she's going to be a real danger to her child and the irish
[2:02:34.240 --> 2:02:40.160]  authorities not having anything else to work on uh took her child into care but now in fact she's
[2:02:40.160 --> 2:02:46.720]  with her child in in a mother and baby unit but no doubt they're creeping around thinking of ways
[2:02:46.720 --> 2:02:51.440]  to try to get the child back well that there's sort of five people i think we'd like to do that
[2:02:51.440 --> 2:02:56.960]  but as long as they stay out of scotland or england they're reasonably safe um i've got a number of
[2:02:56.960 --> 2:03:02.080]  you know i've got a number of these cases gone on i've got a case in turkey at the moment couple
[2:03:02.080 --> 2:03:08.000]  in sweden one in spain one in france and there's about three or four in ireland
[2:03:09.280 --> 2:03:15.760]  and is this people from uh england fleeing big bro mainly england although there's this one from
[2:03:15.760 --> 2:03:21.520]  scotland scotland is not as bad as england because england is completely mad in scotland is mad from
[2:03:21.520 --> 2:03:28.880]  time to time well here uh they take poor people's children i i've gone and seen it they say well
[2:03:28.880 --> 2:03:33.760]  you're you're poor so we're taking your child and then they go and sell them for five hundred
[2:03:33.760 --> 2:03:39.760]  thousand dollars on the market uh through the adoption racket uh but uh i want to go over
[2:03:39.760 --> 2:03:45.920]  manage to get evidence of people paying the authorities in england for them there is a racket
[2:03:45.920 --> 2:03:50.720]  where people make a living out of it in that sense of what one of the things always is to
[2:03:50.720 --> 2:03:56.480]  follow the money and see where people are making money we also see social workers moving into old
[2:03:56.480 --> 2:04:02.560]  people's houses they kick out we have a lot of that here too well yeah it's a lot of it comes
[2:04:02.560 --> 2:04:07.840]  down to the the accountability process is you know what if as soon as you start having secret
[2:04:07.840 --> 2:04:13.280]  courts where it becomes a criminal offense for people to tell you how badly they've been treated
[2:04:13.280 --> 2:04:18.960]  all sorts of misbehavior goes on member of parliament john hemming is our guest we're
[2:04:18.960 --> 2:04:23.120]  going to go to break sir and come back to you any how long will your vote take do you think
[2:04:23.680 --> 2:04:27.520]  the vote when it happens will take me about three or four minutes but the problem is
[2:04:27.520 --> 2:04:32.400]  at the moment the minute it's all about floods if you're interested uh interested at the moment
[2:04:32.400 --> 2:04:37.440]  the minister's on his feet talking about the amendment and then once that's happened there
[2:04:37.440 --> 2:04:41.280]  will be a vote whether there'll be a second vote or the second vote would be another 15 minutes
[2:04:41.280 --> 2:04:46.400]  after the first vote um i know there are going to be three votes between now and nine o'clock
[2:04:47.840 --> 2:04:52.400]  okay well we'll just play it by ear and then call you back 10 minutes after you have to leave us

[2:07:22.400 --> 2:07:27.520]  of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation
[2:07:27.520 --> 2:07:32.000]  is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local

[2:08:00.000 --> 2:08:08.960]  from his central texas command center deep behind enemy lines the information war continues
[2:08:09.520 --> 2:08:16.880]  it's alex jones and the gcn radio network about two years ago i made the statement that i had
[2:08:16.880 --> 2:08:24.880]  covered textbooks used by social workers here in the us as well as europe that state the family is
[2:08:24.880 --> 2:08:32.160]  a disease belonging to you know ancient times we must eradicate it for the state to flourish
[2:08:32.160 --> 2:08:36.880]  we've got to break up the family and in england now people that have children at birth they have to
[2:08:36.880 --> 2:08:42.640]  put a camera in the home watching them guilty until proven innocent secret courts similar things
[2:08:42.640 --> 2:08:48.000]  are being set up here but a male story was also in the telegraph mother not clever enough to raise
[2:08:48.000 --> 2:08:53.680]  child has babies snatched by social workers after running away to ireland to give birth
[2:08:53.680 --> 2:08:59.760]  and they just said because she had a learning disability they took the child but thank god
[2:09:00.480 --> 2:09:07.920]  liberal democrat member of parliament john hemming has been championing her and others he said there
[2:09:07.920 --> 2:09:12.640]  is no evidence that mark and kerry cannot be good parents and i just hope that the irish authorities
[2:09:12.640 --> 2:09:16.400]  can resolve this as quickly as possible there has been a good break in the case but this is
[2:09:16.400 --> 2:09:21.840]  still continuing so get into the secret courts the architecture sir how this works and some
[2:09:21.840 --> 2:09:26.640]  of the other cases you're you're facing in england because i see similar stuff in australia
[2:09:26.640 --> 2:09:34.880]  us and canada yeah the the problem we have particularly is is to do with the accountability
[2:09:34.880 --> 2:09:43.040]  or the quality control on the judgment system used by um local authorities because here it's the
[2:09:43.760 --> 2:09:49.280]  well the children's services authority which is either a county council or a metropolitan
[2:09:49.280 --> 2:09:56.400]  um unitary authority or district council which which makes these proposal they operate through
[2:09:56.400 --> 2:10:01.760]  the family court so the family court supposed to look at it now the family court is a court where
[2:10:01.760 --> 2:10:06.320]  if you talk about what's happened in the court you can go to jail and they do send people to jail
[2:10:06.320 --> 2:10:14.480]  for this um now i i am particularly concerned for instance that the x you're only allowed to
[2:10:14.480 --> 2:10:20.560]  have one expert it's a criminal offense to get a second opinion so you could only have the expert
[2:10:20.560 --> 2:10:25.920]  agreed by the court you can't get somebody else to look at the paper and we have situations for
[2:10:25.920 --> 2:10:34.800]  instance i have one case in birmingham where an expert um was judging whether a mother had the
[2:10:34.800 --> 2:10:40.800]  mental capacity to instruct a solicitor that is if you don't have the mental capacity to
[2:10:40.800 --> 2:10:46.480]  instruct a solicitor the official solicitor comes in and what the official solicitor normally does
[2:10:46.480 --> 2:10:52.000]  is concede the case against you it's like you know if you're in a criminal court you're not allowed
[2:10:52.000 --> 2:10:57.360]  to plead not guilty or you're actually somebody comes in and says you're too stupid to say
[2:10:57.360 --> 2:11:03.600]  you're not guilty well this sounds Kafka-esque i mean this does sound 1984 where it's completely
[2:11:03.600 --> 2:11:09.120]  rigged and our family courts are very very similar uh it's completely rigged that's the whole point
[2:11:09.120 --> 2:11:14.320]  and the if you have a cut if you if you take the sum total of all applications for care orders
[2:11:14.320 --> 2:11:21.280]  by local authority and the figures from 2007 um if you take the sum total the application for a
[2:11:21.280 --> 2:11:28.240]  care order was only rejected in 0.27 percent of cases now that's a slight misrepresentation
[2:11:28.240 --> 2:11:32.880]  because sometimes they withdrew the application for a care order say that number again i mean so
[2:11:32.880 --> 2:11:39.120]  so out of a hundred two seven percent so out of a hundred cases you the parents thought it was
[2:11:39.120 --> 2:11:46.240]  about a quarter of them so 75 percent of the time not 25 out of a hundred but like out of a
[2:11:46.240 --> 2:11:55.040]  thousand winning 27 oh my god so it's less than 1 percent uh no actually 2.7 it's 2.7 okay yeah
[2:11:55.040 --> 2:12:03.920]  i know it's it's it's it's dreadfully bad it's less than 1.7 it's 0.27 percent so so 90 plus
[2:12:03.920 --> 2:12:09.520]  three out of a thousand three out of a thousand so if the government wants your children in england
[2:12:10.800 --> 2:12:16.800]  you have one out of a thousand chance of winning i mean just total kangaroo court it is and it's
[2:12:16.800 --> 2:12:22.560]  a lot of it to do with the way they control the expert evidence if i take the example of them
[2:12:22.560 --> 2:12:28.400]  the the the losing your child to an IQ test um there's a lady who didn't speak english she
[2:12:28.400 --> 2:12:34.800]  came from major um and they gave her an IQ test through an interpreter now that that inherently
[2:12:34.800 --> 2:12:40.560]  makes an IQ test invalid you can't do an IQ test through an interpreter it makes the the outcome
[2:12:40.560 --> 2:12:47.520]  invalid yet they did that my god it's worse than i even thought i think it's worth here because we
[2:12:47.520 --> 2:12:53.680]  had the adoption i know you had adoption targets but here we got the formula wrong as well well
[2:12:53.680 --> 2:12:58.160]  that's right bill clinton got the law passed where a certain number of children have to be
[2:12:58.160 --> 2:13:02.800]  seized every year for the cps to get their money that's where i am and we have the same thing here
[2:13:02.800 --> 2:13:07.120]  i got rid of those a few years ago and we caused the fuss about them but there's the system still
[2:13:07.120 --> 2:13:14.560]  going wrong and what what's interesting is you find that the the way that the system has treated
[2:13:14.560 --> 2:13:20.480]  the babies taken into care causes so much psychological damage that they attack a lot of them attack
[2:13:20.480 --> 2:13:24.480]  their adoptive parents at around about age 10 because they have a thing called and then they
[2:13:24.480 --> 2:13:29.280]  get to drug them and say their special needs and then more money with a little thing comes in as
[2:13:29.280 --> 2:13:34.000]  well but very often they just end up going back into care but it's actually there was some work
[2:13:34.000 --> 2:13:40.160]  done some very good work done by um a researcher called michael professor michael rutter he looked
[2:13:40.160 --> 2:13:49.600]  at the um Romanian orphanage and what he found and the long-term effect of being in a Romanian
[2:13:49.600 --> 2:13:55.280]  orphanage uh for for a baby and what he found which is very interesting is it didn't really have a
[2:13:55.280 --> 2:14:03.520]  long-term effect up to the first six months of life and then the next 12 months between six months
[2:14:03.520 --> 2:14:09.280]  and 18 months was very very important um now what we do in England we take a lot of children
[2:14:09.280 --> 2:14:17.200]  more babies away thousands um in the first six months and then they're they're kept in care for
[2:14:17.200 --> 2:14:21.520]  about a year and a half and they warehouse them and it screws them up and it screws them up yeah
[2:14:21.520 --> 2:14:25.440]  and then you have another there's another piece of research in a book called Enhanced
[2:14:25.440 --> 2:14:32.000]  Enhancing Adoptive Parenting Written Last Year by Helen Rushton Elizabeth Monk uh point out that
[2:14:32.000 --> 2:14:36.800]  there's there's there's what they say if you if you if you I could read it out if you want this
[2:14:36.800 --> 2:14:42.240]  uh the the data looking at bad behavior these others suggest that experience associated with
[2:14:42.240 --> 2:14:47.680]  coming into care and while in the care system may be more influential than experiences before
[2:14:47.680 --> 2:14:51.920]  coming into care in determining children's behavior in the first few months of an adoptive
[2:14:51.920 --> 2:14:57.120]  place from the first few months been 21 months um now the point about that is what they're saying
[2:14:57.120 --> 2:15:02.400]  is that these children who are in adoptive placements they're placed with adoptive families um it all
[2:15:02.400 --> 2:15:09.440]  goes very wrong but it's the evidence they have is that it by taking the children into care
[2:15:09.440 --> 2:15:15.440]  and by their treatment in care that their behavior gets yeah they're screwed up not even so much by
[2:15:15.440 --> 2:15:21.120]  the adoptive parents but being warehouse well not the adoptive parents no it's not because by that
[2:15:21.120 --> 2:15:26.400]  time it's too late no exactly it's it's grabbing the baby when it's six months older a year old
[2:15:26.400 --> 2:15:31.760]  warehousing it for a year uh you're living in basically a cage with a bunch of other kids
[2:15:31.760 --> 2:15:36.080]  punching him in the face no but it's the point about it is it's not the same as being with
[2:15:36.080 --> 2:15:41.280]  your parents however bad they may be at time but yeah i am not somebody who believes the
[2:15:41.280 --> 2:15:46.240]  state should not intervene by the way but let well let me just expand on this my concern is
[2:15:46.240 --> 2:15:50.960]  intervenes inappropriately all the time and this is the the accountability is not there
[2:15:50.960 --> 2:15:55.120]  you know i i understand so let me throw this out at you then because i i'm listening to what
[2:15:55.120 --> 2:15:59.120]  you're saying and i've looked at the numbers i've seen the numbers that the government
[2:15:59.120 --> 2:16:05.920]  in england a child is seven times more likely to be abused or hurt in government custody here
[2:16:05.920 --> 2:16:10.000]  it's five times more likely now you can disagree with that number of you like but i've seen that
[2:16:10.000 --> 2:16:14.800]  in your papers i know here it's been the cover of time magazine you know the shame of foster care
[2:16:14.800 --> 2:16:22.960]  the point is is that let's face the facts you get more lazy people pedophiles scum control freaks
[2:16:22.960 --> 2:16:29.440]  that that that that want access to kids that get into this business now i'm not saying even a large
[2:16:29.440 --> 2:16:35.680]  percentage are but statistically there are a lot more predators that get into state care
[2:16:35.680 --> 2:16:42.480]  because they want access to children and we know we know sir that it is screwing children up
[2:16:42.480 --> 2:16:48.080]  to be in this system and and obviously you want to take somebody's child if they're beating them
[2:16:48.080 --> 2:16:53.280]  with a chain or not not feeding them or they're in a crack house but i don't see that i see them
[2:16:53.280 --> 2:16:59.680]  hunting down christians children i see them taking people's children for no reason well they
[2:16:59.680 --> 2:17:05.440]  take them as an odd odd reason i you know like they have a tendency to take children because
[2:17:05.440 --> 2:17:11.440]  the mother the victim of domestic violence um i find that odd because you would you would
[2:17:11.440 --> 2:17:16.960]  you know the the the evidence of that one of the cases angela barman's case very interesting case
[2:17:16.960 --> 2:17:22.960]  um she's i spoke to today actually and she's um over in ireland at the moment um just to give you
[2:17:22.960 --> 2:17:28.720]  a bit of her history um she was the victim it's been in the papers by the way um she was a victim
[2:17:28.720 --> 2:17:34.320]  of domestic violence um and she found not not because it could be a lot worse i'm not going to
[2:17:34.320 --> 2:17:41.200]  make belittle it but she phoned the police got injunctions against her ex and they the authorities
[2:17:41.200 --> 2:17:47.440]  decided to use this to take her um then five-year-old son into care that's right women aren't told this
[2:17:47.440 --> 2:17:53.440]  they're told put an injunction in even if he is yelling at you and and then they don't know they're
[2:17:53.440 --> 2:17:58.000]  coming to snatch your kid yeah well they actually use the injunction as the reason that the children
[2:17:58.000 --> 2:18:04.720]  were at risk which is all a bit strange um but they this is why people why my mothers are feeling
[2:18:04.720 --> 2:18:11.360]  them not to report domestic violence because um they're worried that their children will be taken
[2:18:11.360 --> 2:18:15.600]  if they report domestic we've got a lot of that in england um but i'll give you more of angela's
[2:18:15.600 --> 2:18:21.120]  story because it's quite an interesting one okay go ahead um so she she got pregnant and she knew
[2:18:21.120 --> 2:18:25.680]  she faced the removal of the baby of birth and probable adoption of the baby so she took her son
[2:18:25.680 --> 2:18:30.800]  out of foster care and did a runner to spain and she lived and worked in spain for about a year and
[2:18:30.800 --> 2:18:36.400]  they found her in spain um and they tried they started proceedings to take her son off her and
[2:18:36.400 --> 2:18:42.560]  bring him back to england right and so she she basically got out of spain and went to suite
[2:18:43.440 --> 2:18:49.440]  to be honest she found it a bit cold there and then she went went to ireland but she went to
[2:18:49.440 --> 2:18:55.600]  ireland to ireland with a view to standing and fighting the system rather than um giving in so
[2:18:55.600 --> 2:19:01.920]  she her son went to school she appeared on all the databases computer systems so that everyone
[2:19:01.920 --> 2:19:08.000]  would know where she was and lo and behold they tried to take her son from ireland so she's got
[2:19:08.000 --> 2:19:14.560]  two sons with her now right at that stage one was seven one was one and a half um and they wanted
[2:19:14.560 --> 2:19:20.160]  to take the older one and put him in care in in foster care in devon with a view to getting adopted
[2:19:20.160 --> 2:19:24.320]  because she was once previously a victim of domestic violence from her husband that she
[2:19:24.320 --> 2:19:30.800]  hadn't seen for a year so so let's be clear because a husband punches you in the nose you
[2:19:30.800 --> 2:19:36.720]  divorce him he actually went that far but but i mean i i mean not her case stay there that he
[2:19:36.720 --> 2:19:41.280]  did punch her on the nose i don't think he actually did but okay i'm not talking about that case i'm
[2:19:41.280 --> 2:19:46.240]  saying i'm saying hypothetically your husband punches you in the nose but not it not he didn't
[2:19:46.240 --> 2:19:51.200]  even do that in this case i understand but your husband punches you you divorce him and then they
[2:19:51.200 --> 2:19:56.400]  still take your kids even though you're in another country when she's been going around europe she's
[2:19:56.400 --> 2:20:01.040]  not been going on but i'm saying they're trying to take the kids is what i'm saying stay there stay

[2:24:10.560 --> 2:24:18.800]  you have a learning disability or you say that you're a victim of domestic violence you get a
[2:24:18.800 --> 2:24:24.640]  divorce and still the state tries to take your children our guest member of a parliament is
[2:24:24.640 --> 2:24:30.240]  being very precise about these particular cases i was just making the point that think about how
[2:24:30.240 --> 2:24:35.520]  amazing that is she's away from her husband uh he's saying in this particular case he didn't
[2:24:35.520 --> 2:24:43.120]  even punch her uh now they're saying yelling at your children as abuse you know don't run the
[2:24:43.120 --> 2:24:49.280]  street no and and that's it so continuing sir you were trying to go through this case so so she's
[2:24:49.280 --> 2:24:54.720]  got two children she's in ireland she's fighting it continue yeah well the little little basically
[2:24:54.720 --> 2:24:59.920]  what what it is is that you know they're trying to take the older child and put him in foster care
[2:24:59.920 --> 2:25:07.040]  in devon all right now that just can't be sensible it just can't be sensible she's sitting there with
[2:25:07.040 --> 2:25:16.640]  two children a younger one who's like two and an older one who's seven um and um they want to take
[2:25:16.640 --> 2:25:22.880]  one of them and put him in foster care in devon not both them the local authorities in ireland
[2:25:22.880 --> 2:25:28.240]  because as i said ireland's a lot more sensible than than england the local authorities in ireland
[2:25:28.240 --> 2:25:34.720]  um have met up with her and they're all right you know they say well there's no problems at all
[2:25:34.720 --> 2:25:43.200]  right um but the the devon ones are still intent on taking her older son and putting him in care
[2:25:43.200 --> 2:25:48.160]  in ireland who are these people what's wrong with them don't they have any soul i don't think it's
[2:25:48.160 --> 2:25:55.520]  completely mad completely and totally mad there can't be any justification for that at all because
[2:25:55.520 --> 2:26:02.080]  if the children are risked then they're both at risk all right not just one of them you can't just
[2:26:02.080 --> 2:26:07.520]  take the one you can get and if the local authority says well one they're actually not at risk then
[2:26:07.520 --> 2:26:16.160]  you should leave them alone well how do they say because she had an ex-husband uh that somehow was
[2:26:16.160 --> 2:26:21.440]  mean to her that she now can't have her older child and i mean this is insane well i know but
[2:26:21.440 --> 2:26:26.560]  the point the point about the part from that is that this part of it is the irrationality of
[2:26:27.120 --> 2:26:31.760]  the the the decision in the first instance which is you're taking completely the wrong actions
[2:26:31.760 --> 2:26:36.720]  actions that do screw up the children there's no question about it the actions of the state
[2:26:37.280 --> 2:26:43.120]  do a lot of damage to these children's lives the evidence is there it's more and more evidence
[2:26:43.120 --> 2:26:50.560]  as time goes by and that isn't an argument for not taking children into care ever and if you take
[2:26:50.560 --> 2:26:55.920]  the issue of learning difficulties there is a wide range of things described as learning
[2:26:55.920 --> 2:27:01.680]  difficulties and there are certain people who have severe learning difficulties where i myself
[2:27:01.680 --> 2:27:05.840]  would not take the view that they could cope with looking after children right so that's not
[2:27:05.840 --> 2:27:09.360]  that's not you know i'm not somebody who says everybody with a learning difficult to have to
[2:27:09.360 --> 2:27:15.360]  live look after their own child i what i say is that we get these decisions really badly wrong
[2:27:15.360 --> 2:27:20.080]  and the checks and balances don't work well you i mean you talk about a secret court where one out
[2:27:20.080 --> 2:27:24.880]  of a thousand times the parents get to get to keep their children out of a thousand three out of a
[2:27:24.880 --> 2:27:31.520]  thousand yeah it's point two seven percent so three out of a thousand trying to get that number
[2:27:31.520 --> 2:27:38.000]  straight it what it is and i'm sorry about being picky about this um the the the the point two seven
[2:27:38.000 --> 2:27:45.440]  percent is roughly three out of a thousand doesn't that right now the point about it is that where
[2:27:45.440 --> 2:27:51.440]  is where the case is contested remember there are various potential outcomes it's possible that the
[2:27:51.440 --> 2:27:58.640]  local authority withdraws their application for a care order but where it's actually a contested
[2:27:58.640 --> 2:28:03.680]  case the the parents win only in just under three out of a thousand cases on the two thousand and
[2:28:03.680 --> 2:28:12.640]  several figures are the people of england getting mad because there are no checks and balances and
[2:28:12.640 --> 2:28:19.360]  the state is running wild some are but i i find it odd because people just sit there and take it
[2:28:20.560 --> 2:28:26.160]  i find it very very odd because here you have some really dreadful activity
[2:28:27.280 --> 2:28:32.160]  and yet people just sit there and say dum de dum de dum de let's just get on with our lives you know
[2:28:32.960 --> 2:28:36.800]  um because it's this whole whole issue about miscarriages of justice it's where do you
[2:28:37.360 --> 2:28:40.560]  where do you start and where do you stop it was well i don't know who was it that
[2:28:40.560 --> 2:28:44.800]  pasta who said first they came for this and then they came for the you know then they came for the
[2:28:44.800 --> 2:28:49.200]  jews and they came you know i can't remember the whole statement but unless you actually fight
[2:28:49.200 --> 2:28:52.640]  injustice um it just gets to be a real mess
[2:28:55.200 --> 2:29:00.000]  but what's wrong with the child protective services they know it's hurting children they
[2:29:00.000 --> 2:29:06.080]  know it's a fraud they know it's evil they know their courts are a joke i mean who are these people
[2:29:06.080 --> 2:29:13.120]  well that's what you can understand in a sense why a lot of people have left the job
[2:29:13.120 --> 2:29:18.080]  and there are so many vacancies so we get child protection social workers from all
[2:29:18.080 --> 2:29:22.400]  sort including america to be fair although america is not a bad idea because at least we
[2:29:22.400 --> 2:29:29.200]  speak a similar language um you know going to get a hunting child protection social workers
[2:29:29.200 --> 2:29:33.680]  from greece and everything it's a bit odd in a sense because you know you'd expect somebody
[2:29:33.680 --> 2:29:38.000]  who understands the cultures here really they're not what greece is massively different but you
[2:29:38.000 --> 2:29:42.560]  want somebody who's pretty pretty operative so you're saying they're bringing foreigners in
[2:29:43.120 --> 2:29:46.800]  yeah they come from all over the place because they can't get English people to do it
[2:29:46.800 --> 2:29:52.000]  oh my god so they've got foreign foreign child kidnapping mercenaries stay there

[2:33:09.840 --> 2:33:15.600]  hemming joins us and see it always gets worse i've noticed that a lot of the big city police
[2:33:15.600 --> 2:33:22.080]  department chiefs are foreigners now in the u.s uh the majority of new recruits for the arming
[2:33:22.080 --> 2:33:28.800]  uh are illegal aliens are recruited out of mexico city manila philippines uh ukraine
[2:33:30.800 --> 2:33:36.880]  and to hear this member of parliament talk about foreigners they're bringing in foreigners
[2:33:36.880 --> 2:33:42.080]  who i guess can't speak even very good english i want to be clear with him on that and then they
[2:33:42.080 --> 2:33:48.880]  take your children uh because they can't find english people to do it and uh ladies and gentlemen
[2:33:48.880 --> 2:33:52.800]  again the good people get out because their conscience can't go along with this evil
[2:33:52.800 --> 2:33:57.120]  and all you get left with is these heartless people who get bonuses the more kids they grab
[2:33:57.760 --> 2:34:02.400]  uh and and of course we have the elder services taking people's houses for themselves here
[2:34:02.400 --> 2:34:07.200]  i've seen that in the british newspapers there i mean look crooks go and join this
[2:34:07.200 --> 2:34:12.320]  and i'll just come right out and say it and and and there's a much greater evil and abusive
[2:34:12.320 --> 2:34:17.120]  children statistically from what i've seen committed by government than what the supposed
[2:34:17.120 --> 2:34:24.720]  parents do and uh so it's just incredible ladies and gentlemen and there's no oversight no way to
[2:34:24.720 --> 2:34:29.280]  stop these people other than members of parliament fighting against it so serve flesh that out
[2:34:29.280 --> 2:34:34.480]  you're telling i mean the other statistics i mean can they speak english on on exactly how
[2:34:34.480 --> 2:34:40.560]  many people can they speak english i mean so somebody shows up for i it's a question where
[2:34:40.560 --> 2:34:45.120]  americans do you say americans speak adequate english i think probably adequate english yeah
[2:34:45.120 --> 2:34:50.640]  to be fair a lot but you were saying from greece and romanian well greece you see i i again
[2:34:50.640 --> 2:34:56.240]  obviously people learn english but the underlying point is this is what why is it we cannot
[2:34:57.520 --> 2:35:03.440]  fill our vacancies with people from england and in part it's because the the job's got
[2:35:03.440 --> 2:35:08.800]  to be such a mess and there are some really good people still working in this area i don't i don't
[2:35:08.800 --> 2:35:14.080]  sort of say that everybody's exactly the same of course that's not the case but it's a gradual
[2:35:14.080 --> 2:35:19.280]  process and everyone says oh it's dreadful we've got vacancies we've got vacancies everywhere we've
[2:35:19.280 --> 2:35:23.440]  got nobody to do the job and they don't try to think well that's because you're trying to make
[2:35:23.440 --> 2:35:29.360]  people do a dreadful job in other countries they don't have the same problems i don't know what about
[2:35:29.360 --> 2:35:33.680]  america but in other countries across europe they don't have that problem no i mean you go to new
[2:35:33.680 --> 2:35:39.440]  york or la it's mainly cops can't speak english and they love ruling you because they came from
[2:35:39.440 --> 2:35:44.480]  countries that were third world police states but i can't comment about america because i haven't
[2:35:44.480 --> 2:35:49.600]  been there for some time to be honest i don't know but sir i mean going through this specifically
[2:35:49.600 --> 2:35:55.440]  you're saying i mean is it a large portion our foreigners who speak broken english are seizing
[2:35:55.440 --> 2:36:00.720]  the children i don't actually know the proportion what i do know is that there are material numbers
[2:36:00.720 --> 2:36:07.440]  who who are brought into the country to fill the vacancy uh i wouldn't that's not what i see is
[2:36:07.440 --> 2:36:12.960]  that's a symptom of a problem if you you know to be fair the normal theoretical role of trying to
[2:36:12.960 --> 2:36:17.120]  look after children everything else should be a relatively nice thing to do although sometimes
[2:36:17.120 --> 2:36:24.160]  you get conflict but but this is actually ending up as massively aggressive right and that there's
[2:36:24.160 --> 2:36:28.800]  so people are voting with their feet and getting out as quickly as they can talk about that we see
[2:36:28.800 --> 2:36:37.040]  a massive exodus out of england of real brits now we see an exodus out of scotland as well
[2:36:37.040 --> 2:36:40.880]  speak about that and then some of the other hard story migratory issues but always have
[2:36:40.880 --> 2:36:46.480]  to be migration birmingham is a city built on two types of migration one is in and one's out
[2:36:46.480 --> 2:36:51.120]  and across the world there are around about 20 birmingham's including a few in it i think you've
[2:36:51.120 --> 2:36:56.000]  got about five also in america haven't used something like five birmingham like detroit
[2:36:57.600 --> 2:36:59.200]  well there's there's birmingham alabama
[2:37:01.200 --> 2:37:05.280]  you got other i don't know there's a number of places you're saying the name from birmingham
[2:37:05.280 --> 2:37:09.840]  people moving from birmingham i don't mean i've been mototype cities but i mean places that you
[2:37:09.840 --> 2:37:13.840]  have seen english people interviewed saying they are leaving because of the police day
[2:37:14.800 --> 2:37:20.400]  that may be true um there could be all sorts of reasons to want to go and the fact that they're
[2:37:20.400 --> 2:37:25.200]  sort of like setting things up to trap people so they can charge fines to people you know one of
[2:37:25.200 --> 2:37:32.080]  the stealth tax system so you know there are more and more ways there was a beautiful one recently
[2:37:32.080 --> 2:37:38.560]  where uh i believe somebody was fined by a police officer 60 pounds for littering for dropping a
[2:37:38.560 --> 2:37:45.840]  10 pound note repeat that one up i mean they obviously dropped it on accident well yeah
[2:37:46.400 --> 2:37:52.320]  what what assumed so yes it dropped a 10 pound note and they're fine 60 quid for doing that but
[2:37:52.320 --> 2:38:00.000]  i've seen reports in the news where they'll watch cafes and if a potato chip flies off the table
[2:38:00.000 --> 2:38:06.240]  the police run over you know before a bird can grab it and start writing them tickets just greedily
[2:38:06.240 --> 2:38:12.480]  like piranha i've not spotted that one i have seen somebody who was um was well he's being
[2:38:12.480 --> 2:38:21.040]  prosecuted for blowing his nose in a parked car blowing his nose in a car yeah blowing his nose
[2:38:21.040 --> 2:38:25.360]  he was not in control of the car because he blew his nose
[2:38:25.360 --> 2:38:32.320]  yeah they're doing that now we're even have a cell phone making money you see that they get
[2:38:32.320 --> 2:38:38.240]  they get a target to go and get so many fines it um and what the one of the ploys they have
[2:38:38.240 --> 2:38:43.440]  with speed cameras in england is to have a large sort of six lane highway and then they take the
[2:38:43.440 --> 2:38:48.240]  speed limit down to trap people and then they put in a speed camera and it clocks up the money
[2:38:48.240 --> 2:38:53.840]  so literally it's a bunch of foreign pirates
[2:38:56.400 --> 2:39:02.320]  you can you can put it that way but you see what the point is that within the system there are
[2:39:02.320 --> 2:39:08.720]  people doing a good job within the system the people doing a dismal job um and the leadership
[2:39:08.720 --> 2:39:15.440]  is directing them to be more and more pernicious more and more aggressive so they have more and more
[2:39:15.440 --> 2:39:19.920]  references going through it gets more and more overloaded they bring in a computer system which
[2:39:19.920 --> 2:39:26.000]  is set up so once you've made a judgment you can't easily change it and they they put pressure on
[2:39:26.000 --> 2:39:30.720]  not what judgments you make but how quickly you make adjustments so an initial assessment
[2:39:30.720 --> 2:39:37.600]  has to be done in within seven days and a core assessment in 35 days and and what happens is
[2:39:37.600 --> 2:39:43.520]  that you're putting pressure on people to make rapid decisions well i saw a story i saw a story
[2:39:43.520 --> 2:39:50.160]  about 2 000 cameras now 20 000 cameras now i've read reports they want everybody at berth uh
[2:39:50.160 --> 2:39:54.880]  because they can't get neighbors to rat on neighbors everyone has cameras in the house
[2:39:54.880 --> 2:40:00.560]  if they have their way well i think that's pushing the the the the the the the the examples i cite
[2:40:00.560 --> 2:40:05.600]  i i i can go back to source and and give you information on no but that's in your newspapers
[2:40:05.600 --> 2:40:10.080]  have you seen that where they're where they're making newborn families have cameras in the home
[2:40:10.080 --> 2:40:14.720]  watching them yes well they've done that they've done that in a what called assessment centers
[2:40:14.720 --> 2:40:18.640]  for some time and they are a bit like that with cameras all over the place
[2:40:21.200 --> 2:40:26.080]  which is you know the point the problem is when you actually look at the the underlying question
[2:40:26.080 --> 2:40:31.280]  we're supposed to be trying to reduce the number of children that die from child abuse and neglect
[2:40:31.280 --> 2:40:36.960]  which i think is a reasonable objective to set and yet actually when you take the issue of serious
[2:40:36.960 --> 2:40:44.400]  incident notifications to compare the figures from 2008 to 2009 um they've gone up by 23
[2:40:44.400 --> 2:40:52.560]  percent so it's fairly well we've had an epidemic of foster care and in government custody children
[2:40:52.560 --> 2:40:59.760]  dying and i've played a famous clip in arkansas where the cps head says children will die it's
[2:40:59.760 --> 2:41:07.840]  not our problem so why have them then well exactly but the point is is is that is that
[2:41:07.840 --> 2:41:12.560]  they're now trying to say yelling at your child we will take it i know i know but they don't care
[2:41:12.560 --> 2:41:18.800]  if the child dies or they do care if you yell at it well they're saying they don't care if it dies
[2:41:18.800 --> 2:41:23.280]  in their custody oh that's what you mean well that's not very good is there in fact guys they
[2:41:23.280 --> 2:41:29.040]  won't believe it go to youtube and type in cps worker says children will die and the newscast
[2:41:29.040 --> 2:41:33.600]  starts with him going i'm not worried about it you know two children in the small town and one week
[2:41:33.600 --> 2:41:40.080]  dying in government care and he goes doesn't matter no big deal you know we're doing good we're the
[2:41:40.080 --> 2:41:45.440]  government yeah i know it's just lack of accountability well i'll tell you what i found
[2:41:45.440 --> 2:41:52.960]  they're also hiring in the us now from the welfare roles uh i mean literally i'm no exaggeration half
[2:41:52.960 --> 2:41:58.640]  of the people i talked to were on welfare are going to school uh and i'm gonna talk about women
[2:41:58.640 --> 2:42:03.680]  with seven kids you know driving around in brand new cars and all the welfare money they get
[2:42:03.680 --> 2:42:09.440]  and they're and they're all going to school to be cps workers well it's one of these things
[2:42:09.440 --> 2:42:14.560]  is you get a vacancy that you're trying to get desperate to get people to do it so they reduce
[2:42:14.560 --> 2:42:24.160]  the standard i and it is frankly you couldn't run it worse than they do give us your website sir
[2:42:24.160 --> 2:42:28.800]  well i've got various but john hemming dot blogspot.com is one of that the web blog
[2:42:32.080 --> 2:42:36.640]  john hemming dot blogspot.com i've got various bits and bobs on there and then
[2:42:36.640 --> 2:42:42.480]  as i've got john dot hemming dot name as well i put some of the things on there but it is quite
[2:42:42.480 --> 2:42:46.640]  difficult because you have to get to a situation where you can talk about these things and some
[2:42:46.640 --> 2:42:53.280]  of them get trapped by the secrecy of the courts well bottom line sir having kangaroo courts were
[2:42:53.280 --> 2:42:59.600]  three out of a thousand are found not guilty where the the one government expert comes in
[2:43:00.160 --> 2:43:05.040]  no one else is allowed to have any witnesses you are you wouldn't you wouldn't believe it
[2:43:05.040 --> 2:43:09.680]  happened because it does you are guilty until proven guilty until proven a slave of the state
[2:43:09.680 --> 2:43:14.480]  yeah i mean i mean overall you talk about how it's really hurting children to be in these uh
[2:43:14.480 --> 2:43:19.360]  you know dormitories when they take them before placement how it's not dormitory no but there
[2:43:19.360 --> 2:43:24.960]  is there are situations which aren't very good well i've actually seen the reports out of england
[2:43:24.960 --> 2:43:29.280]  in here in the us but i mean i agree you're the expert you're there you're you know you're really
[2:43:29.280 --> 2:43:36.560]  tackling about it is the care is not adequate and it causes long-term damage well my point is
[2:43:37.600 --> 2:43:42.880]  from all the statistics i've seen the government does a lot more harm than good i think as it
[2:43:42.880 --> 2:43:47.840]  currently stands yes that's the case but that doesn't mean that inherently it needs to be the case
[2:43:47.840 --> 2:43:54.240]  but the government shows no intention of fixing this anywhere in the world we see this you know
[2:43:54.240 --> 2:44:00.160]  the soviets loved it hitler loved it this is what authoritarian systems do they want i mean look at
[2:44:00.160 --> 2:44:03.840]  north korea i don't have you seen the documentaries about how large populations live in these work
[2:44:03.840 --> 2:44:08.960]  camps and five days a year they'll they'll put a man with a woman in a cell and then they produce
[2:44:08.960 --> 2:44:13.920]  a child it's sent to another camp and then and they say this is how the state rules there is no
[2:44:13.920 --> 2:44:20.320]  family yeah i suppose there's an element of that i think you know maybe north korea's doing it right
[2:44:20.320 --> 2:44:26.240]  according to the maybe it's a heaven maybe maybe we're the cooks maybe we're the cooks john
[2:44:28.240 --> 2:44:35.360]  i yeah i i i don't think so i think the the difficulty is it's what one of my colleagues
[2:44:35.360 --> 2:44:40.720]  is referring to the rule of the celebrity where they get to be more and more immediate interest in
[2:44:40.720 --> 2:44:47.840]  the in sort of what's well known because it's well now and there's there's little judgment used
[2:44:47.840 --> 2:44:56.080]  as to what's right and what's wrong well clearly and i have the textbooks i'm sure you're well
[2:44:56.080 --> 2:45:00.480]  read but i mean have you read what they teach social workers how the families are bad and
[2:45:01.120 --> 2:45:07.440]  uh well i i i i'd have to see the documents you see i i i know there are lots of different views
[2:45:07.440 --> 2:45:12.400]  and people tend to have their own ideologies and again one of the things about not having proper
[2:45:12.400 --> 2:45:18.160]  accountability is if somebody's got their own little pet subject all right so some are obsessed
[2:45:18.160 --> 2:45:23.040]  that children should never be smacked all right and so they go around removing any child that's
[2:45:23.040 --> 2:45:28.720]  smacked all right and that's that's that's sort of different motivations for different people
[2:45:28.720 --> 2:45:33.200]  and and the the the parameters in which they operate are not sufficiently adequately controlled
[2:45:33.200 --> 2:45:39.520]  well it's not illegal to smack your child in the u.s when they keep running out in traffic
[2:45:39.520 --> 2:45:46.240]  you just can't hurt them uh how is it in england it's a it's a sort of similar situation you've
[2:45:46.240 --> 2:45:51.120]  got some people who are obsessed that you should never ever smack a child all right which is i
[2:45:51.120 --> 2:45:58.720]  think complete nonsense um and but then they the problem is that they can go and run riot in the
[2:45:58.720 --> 2:46:04.000]  child protection system go around protecting children for being smacked yeah but what about
[2:46:04.000 --> 2:46:08.560]  problems with child protective services abusing children i mean raping them you name it it's
[2:46:08.560 --> 2:46:13.120]  rampant here well we've made we've made a bit of progress here because we now have the general
[2:46:13.120 --> 2:46:17.760]  social care council which does actually strike social workers off when they rape their children
[2:46:17.760 --> 2:46:23.360]  in their care so that's an improvement but they don't get imprisoned i guess it's just
[2:46:23.360 --> 2:46:28.640]  not imprisoned as well no i don't i don't think that i think the there have been problems with that
[2:46:28.640 --> 2:46:32.800]  there's no question there's problems in the past with the because where does a smart pedophile go
[2:46:32.800 --> 2:46:38.240]  he doesn't go to school grounds trying to lure kids into his van he goes and becomes a you know
[2:46:38.240 --> 2:46:42.720]  let's say you're a romanian or let's say you're a greek pedophile you just moved to jolly old
[2:46:42.720 --> 2:46:47.440]  england and let the raping begin yeah well that's why you need real accountability and i i worry
[2:46:47.440 --> 2:46:53.600]  about how many children get lost as well you think the the burrow yeah lost we had 3000 plus
[2:46:53.600 --> 2:47:00.640]  disappear in cps custody in florida and cnn just said they're gone yeah i know it's not good enough
[2:47:00.640 --> 2:47:05.440]  at all so oh so you have them disappearing too i'd lost a child sometimes the social worker
[2:47:05.440 --> 2:47:09.120]  gets a little mad and maybe chops the head off and buries them in the back i mean i think that
[2:47:09.680 --> 2:47:15.120]  obviously a bit of an extreme case but um i think the the concern i have is that
[2:47:15.120 --> 2:47:20.880]  that we we have figures as to how many children are lost but there's no proper audit of the process
[2:47:20.880 --> 2:47:27.120]  at all the the whole system is very very resistive to any order to process yeah it's just designed
[2:47:27.120 --> 2:47:30.720]  so they can have their party and that's the end of it i mean do you hear about the texas youth
[2:47:30.720 --> 2:47:35.680]  commission where they had rape parties of the children i didn't hear about i know i know things
[2:47:35.680 --> 2:47:41.680]  like that used to go on in jersey i don't know if you know i had them an exiled senator from
[2:47:41.680 --> 2:47:48.640]  jersey staying with me for a couple of months he um he um revealed on his weblog the details of a
[2:47:48.640 --> 2:47:54.800]  failed investigation into a nurse who'd been murdering patients um in jersey which is an island
[2:47:54.800 --> 2:47:59.520]  just off france it's what's called a crown dependency so it's not part of the united kingdom
[2:48:00.160 --> 2:48:06.880]  um but it is linked up in in various complex it's a protector it i don't know what a protector
[2:48:06.880 --> 2:48:12.080]  it is but it's a crown dependency and it's sort of part of the wider you know bits like Gibraltar
[2:48:12.080 --> 2:48:18.080]  and kerns in jersey and the isle of man and things like that it's like the azores are part of
[2:48:18.080 --> 2:48:23.920]  portugal sorry it's like the azores are part of portugal yeah i probably i don't know whether
[2:48:23.920 --> 2:48:28.800]  the azores may be actually part of portugal but the the difference is that they're not then they
[2:48:28.800 --> 2:48:34.800]  don't have mp's in parliament they have their own government uh and what the hierarchy the oligarchs
[2:48:34.800 --> 2:48:42.000]  there decided to do was because he had revealed about this botched investigation that they would
[2:48:42.000 --> 2:48:46.560]  prosecute him under the data protection act so he's he did a runner from jersey and he was
[2:48:46.560 --> 2:48:50.080]  staying with me for a couple of months but he's gone on now to go and stay with an old police
[2:48:50.080 --> 2:48:55.120]  officer um who was part of jersey and they were trying to sort of deal with all the corrupt things
[2:48:55.120 --> 2:49:02.160]  going on uh you know the resist the system was resistant to that so you know so he's he's moved
[2:49:02.160 --> 2:49:06.480]  on but it's you know these sorts of things that that sort of thing did use to go on in jersey
[2:49:08.080 --> 2:49:13.120]  well there's no doubt i mean government no matter how you try to make it work well
[2:49:14.000 --> 2:49:19.440]  the bigger it gets the more abusive it gets and what is there is is there any sign of reform i mean
[2:49:19.440 --> 2:49:26.720]  you've got some accountability and transparency are the key thing so it's it's absolute and what
[2:49:26.720 --> 2:49:31.680]  within that you have to allow people to blow the whistle and one of the problems we have with the
[2:49:31.680 --> 2:49:36.000]  government here is under pressure from the the practitioners that is the people who make money
[2:49:36.000 --> 2:49:41.680]  out of child protection they're bringing in a law to mean that you have to keep anonymous anyone who
[2:49:41.680 --> 2:49:51.360]  is ever involved in one of these cases and that's just dreadful well we have a rewards here for it
[2:49:51.360 --> 2:49:56.720]  so people just make full livings lying about folks yeah i know well that's that's another that's
[2:49:56.720 --> 2:50:02.000]  an interesting problem where you have a different standard of proof for criminal proceedings and
[2:50:02.000 --> 2:50:06.880]  for civil proceedings so well you know what set up the family court i mean was set up as eugenics
[2:50:06.880 --> 2:50:13.440]  courts i don't know what yours yours your system is but here we have a problem with people getting
[2:50:13.440 --> 2:50:20.960]  compensation for criminal injuries that are just basically made up oh yeah every day i literally
[2:50:20.960 --> 2:50:25.440]  i see articles where some crackhead wants more crack so they go point at some old woman's house
[2:50:25.440 --> 2:50:30.080]  and say i bought the crack there and they go here's a thousand and the swat team goes to ending
[2:50:30.080 --> 2:50:35.360]  guns down the old woman and just says hey we're the police we're taking care of you that's the end
[2:50:35.360 --> 2:50:42.320]  of it well i'd say it's an amazing interview with liberal democrat mp john hemming and it's

[2:54:17.440 --> 2:54:26.160]  be the enforcers this is a premeditated program and plan the government seizes children
[2:54:26.160 --> 2:54:32.960]  choose them up spits them out the average more than two-thirds of children in the us are on
[2:54:32.960 --> 2:54:38.080]  psychotropic drugs that are in government care they grab you when you cry they say you're mentally

[2:55:16.320 --> 2:55:28.000]  and i mean authoritarian orphanages are famous this is the system waging war on humanity now
[2:55:28.000 --> 2:55:33.360]  i've covered all of obama's announcements in his budget to jack up taxes and break all his promises
[2:55:33.360 --> 2:55:40.160]  and get rid of insurance exemptions and home exemptions and tax people making 200 000 combined
[2:55:40.160 --> 2:55:46.960]  incomes so that's people making 100 000 dollars basically a piece uh just george soros's media
[2:55:46.960 --> 2:55:52.400]  matter says obama never said he wasn't going to tax people making 200 000 just complete lying
[2:55:52.400 --> 2:55:57.920]  because george soros wants your money paid to him through the central banks now we've got south
[2:55:57.920 --> 2:56:07.680]  australia government gags internet debate that's news.com.au i want to get into uh also in my stack

[2:56:33.280 --> 2:56:40.400]  brutish stupid enforcers who love it they love the power you talk about the average bureaucrat
[2:56:40.400 --> 2:56:44.880]  or enforcer they're dumbered in a box of rocks they don't care if they're drinking fluoride water
[2:56:45.440 --> 2:56:49.760]  they don't care if they're eating gmo food rotten their liver they think it's funny
[2:56:49.760 --> 2:56:54.160]  because all they know is they got a machine gun and they're gonna get your guns and they're gonna
[2:56:54.160 --> 2:57:00.320]  have their way with you that's what happens in 99 of societies and it's happening here through

[2:57:50.240 --> 2:57:57.920]  who actually uh was honest again i'm not on some savage worshiping binge here it's just that he is
[2:57:57.920 --> 2:58:02.480]  just getting better and better and better and better and better saying obama's gonna stage

[3:00:09.520 --> 3:00:15.280]  well it's already hour number four thank you for joining us i want to run through a
[3:00:15.280 --> 3:00:21.520]  smattering of phone calls and i'm going to get into the latest on monsanto internet censorship
[3:00:21.520 --> 3:00:26.960]  and i want to play four different radio clips to show different styles of disinformation by
[3:00:26.960 --> 3:00:33.360]  mainstream fake neocons that's coming up right now let's go to your calls chris in texas you're on
[3:00:33.360 --> 3:00:39.040]  the air alex thanks for taking my car great to be on with you i've had i have a question i've been
[3:00:39.040 --> 3:00:45.920]  going through uh i'm reading ron paul's and the fed book blowing me away and i wanted to ask you
[3:00:45.920 --> 3:00:49.840]  first of all if you've heard anything about how the audit the fed movement's going but i wanted to
[3:00:49.840 --> 3:00:55.760]  ask you what do you think the likelihood is that we could possibly end the fed someday
[3:00:55.760 --> 3:01:02.320]  and how would that impact the globalist agenda well if we actually got congress over the money
[3:01:02.320 --> 3:01:06.800]  and educated the public about it and ended fractional reserve banking we would go back to
[3:01:06.800 --> 3:01:15.920]  on average 10 growth rates that we had from 1786 until 1913 roughly instead of the new parasite
[3:01:16.720 --> 3:01:22.000]  economy that we live under the problem is their financial terrorist they will incrementally wreck
[3:01:22.000 --> 3:01:26.720]  the economy to consolidate it that's their goal to end industrialized civilization
[3:01:27.600 --> 3:01:31.440]  get a manageable group of humans they can control of no more than 500 million and that's
[3:01:31.440 --> 3:01:37.440]  stated by the nasa scientist by the un people i mean i had mark marino climate depot on yesterday
[3:01:37.440 --> 3:01:43.520]  quoting the book by the head nasa climate scientist you know open population reduction
[3:01:44.160 --> 3:01:48.880]  and so they're going to engage in terrorism but if you identify that they're the financial
[3:01:48.880 --> 3:01:53.360]  terrorist then they won't be able to get away with it so it's a process we don't have a choice
[3:01:54.240 --> 3:01:58.960]  but i mean does that answer your question yeah pretty much i appreciate you taking my call i know
[3:01:58.960 --> 3:02:03.360]  you got other people thanks alex god bless you chris appreciate the call how was the oh the other
[3:02:03.360 --> 3:02:06.960]  part of your question how's the end the fed movement going it passed the house it's in the
[3:02:06.960 --> 3:02:12.320]  senate they were unable to water it down the senate's getting more and more co-sponsors all the time
[3:02:13.040 --> 3:02:17.280]  and his heat gets put on the bankers it's only a matter of time till it passes
[3:02:17.280 --> 3:02:21.360]  if it doesn't pass in this congress they'll reintroduce it in the house again it'll probably
[3:02:21.360 --> 3:02:26.960]  pass the next time but we're identifying the real government and we've gone from maybe 10%
[3:02:26.960 --> 3:02:33.040]  knowing the fellow reserves private run for profit and predatory to now over 90% in major polls it was
[3:02:33.040 --> 3:02:38.960]  75% a year ago so the awakening has happened now we've just got to clean these people out
[3:02:39.600 --> 3:02:44.880]  let's go ahead and talk to eddie in florida eddie you're on the air thanks alex thanks for opening
[3:02:44.880 --> 3:02:50.320]  my eyes it's been listening for a while somebody woke me up about two years ago welcome by the way
[3:02:50.320 --> 3:02:54.400]  i thought he was crazy and they sent me out on this quest for knowledge i just wanted to make
[3:02:54.400 --> 3:03:00.080]  a couple of points i hear on your program a lot of the places people saying you know why in a lot
[3:03:00.080 --> 3:03:04.960]  of all of us knowing what they're doing why do they keep pushing forward i think it's pretty
[3:03:04.960 --> 3:03:10.240]  obvious you know they orchestrated this economic collapse but they cannot control every aspect
[3:03:10.240 --> 3:03:15.440]  of the economy so i think what's happening is you know with the cap and trade and everything
[3:03:15.440 --> 3:03:19.840]  else they're doing or enslave us i think they're gone for broke while everyone's asleep because
[3:03:19.840 --> 3:03:24.400]  if the dollar collapses and everything else that's going to happen happens before they get all these
[3:03:24.400 --> 3:03:28.960]  things through i don't think it's going to work it's going to be too late you know that's it
[3:03:28.960 --> 3:03:36.400]  that's it they're in a race to get their north com homeland security and and and carbon tax grid in
[3:03:36.400 --> 3:03:42.480]  to to make sure we are so destitute and just trying to pay our bills that we can't stand up against
[3:03:42.480 --> 3:03:47.760]  them they know to you as a giant the people once we wake up that's it games over i mean you know
[3:03:47.760 --> 3:03:53.280]  they listen when jackson pushed out the central bank originally you know they still control the
[3:03:53.280 --> 3:03:58.320]  president like they do now and they made his life miserable and that's why i think they're so arrogant
[3:03:58.320 --> 3:04:03.760]  about it you know i mean you look at i read the book from jack o'allan and and and something jumped
[3:04:03.760 --> 3:04:08.880]  out of me out of that big book i mean that the rochelle formal is right there it says the sanctity

[3:04:34.320 --> 3:04:40.240]  he also said that if you took all the power away from the bankers and gave them the power to issue
[3:04:40.240 --> 3:04:45.040]  currency and credit with the struggle of a pen they would buy back the entire world through fraud

[3:10:19.840 --> 3:10:28.000]  you daniel in new york you're on the air daniel hello a quick comment and two questions
[3:10:28.800 --> 3:10:34.080]  um i've been a subscriber of yours for two years since you woke me up starting next spring i'll
[3:10:34.080 --> 3:10:39.200]  be starting one of the country's top law schools and that's why i let you know that when i get
[3:10:39.200 --> 3:10:44.720]  through the bar uh if you ever need any pro bono legal research or representation please
[3:10:44.720 --> 3:10:50.800]  don't hesitate to let me know well thank you sir and uh second of my one of my questions is
[3:10:51.680 --> 3:10:59.040]  um i heard jason bernard speaking about the internet too and how the uh internet as we know
[3:10:59.040 --> 3:11:08.960]  is to be um well just uh absorbed exactly so my question is what um measures can we take to
[3:11:08.960 --> 3:11:18.400]  uh keep some freedom um alive on the on the engine i mean do we make a big stink out of
[3:11:18.400 --> 3:11:24.400]  microsoft and others helping china build their grid and microsoft head and founder gate saying
[3:11:24.400 --> 3:11:29.760]  censorship is good as he did a week ago make a big stink out of australia openly not even
[3:11:29.760 --> 3:11:35.360]  allowing political discussion about candidates i mean that's mainstream news out of australia
[3:11:35.360 --> 3:11:43.120]  today uh that italy's doing this say no to the end of net neutrality say no to internet too
[3:11:43.120 --> 3:11:50.560]  um educate people uh point out that government through homeland security with cyber security
[3:11:50.560 --> 3:11:55.120]  their own head quit last year and said the pentagon's taking the internet over just let
[3:11:55.120 --> 3:12:02.240]  people know this can really happen this is really happening okay um my second
[3:12:02.240 --> 3:12:10.160]  question uh yes go ahead sir my second question is for those of us who are thinking of getting
[3:12:10.160 --> 3:12:18.400]  into gold um i know through freedom force international there is a system gbay which
[3:12:18.400 --> 3:12:25.360]  works something like with um virtual gold certificates what system do you suggest uh
[3:12:25.360 --> 3:12:31.840]  whereby one can get off the fiat system without having to interface with it because i don't
[3:12:31.840 --> 3:12:38.960]  understand the power of gold is just the leverage it gives with the fiat system well that's true
[3:12:38.960 --> 3:12:44.640]  look a lot of people get certificates and hold it in vaults in other countries i wouldn't ever
[3:12:44.640 --> 3:12:51.840]  do that uh i would hedge it you know i would put it in a couple different safety deposit boxes
[3:12:51.840 --> 3:12:56.480]  put it in family safety deposit box because if they even try to come seize your stuff they won't know
[3:12:56.480 --> 3:13:03.280]  know bury it on the back 40 part of it keep a little bit you're safe at home uh i mean it's so
[3:13:03.280 --> 3:13:08.400]  portable uh you know silver's also good and for me it's a backup because i know they're
[3:13:08.400 --> 3:13:14.160]  devaluing the currency and i know it's gone from 260 something dollars to 1100 it's up
[3:13:14.160 --> 3:13:20.320]  eight dollars a day it may fluctuate up and down but over the long haul all evidence shows it's
[3:13:20.320 --> 3:13:28.400]  only going up uh but uh i wouldn't hold gold certificates i mean i some people do that i i
[3:13:28.400 --> 3:13:35.840]  think it's crazy i think it's crazy i mean i would want to physically hold it possessions nine
[3:13:35.840 --> 3:13:42.080]  tens of the law does that answer your question yes it does thank you very much alec you bet thank
[3:13:42.080 --> 3:13:47.120]  you daniel i mean the government's announcing that they may take over everyone's 401ks and
[3:13:47.120 --> 3:13:52.400]  pensions and then tax it and then pay it to you as a check they're openly announcing they're not
[3:13:52.400 --> 3:13:58.880]  going to ensure uh money markets i mean most the money i've gotten the bank is back up and
[3:13:58.880 --> 3:14:03.920]  for savings accounts for my kids and to run this office and we've got like six months of operating
[3:14:03.920 --> 3:14:09.600]  money i mean i i i hoard that cash so if everything's shut down we can still operate for a while
[3:14:09.600 --> 3:14:14.000]  and we have a mission here and it's in a money market i've got to go get it out of there and
[3:14:14.000 --> 3:14:19.760]  it doesn't even get two three percent a year uh but but the point is it's it's there as liquid
[3:14:19.760 --> 3:14:24.800]  cash and now they're saying that's not even protected uh you know to a hundred thousand
[3:14:24.800 --> 3:14:32.080]  dollars by the fdic i mean look that was only a prelude what we saw in 2008 2009 with the banks
[3:14:32.080 --> 3:14:39.840]  a prelude people need to get out a paper they're crazy and ted anderson by the way is still running
[3:14:39.840 --> 3:14:48.640]  that deal today a free 157 dollar year subscription hard copy or digital to the international forecaster
[3:14:48.640 --> 3:14:53.600]  by bob chairman invaluable information this is thick like 40 pages thick usually sometimes it's
[3:14:53.600 --> 3:15:01.040]  even thicker sometimes smaller when you buy a frank for what did he say 257 i think i'm going
[3:15:01.040 --> 3:15:08.960]  from memory so basically that's like 103 dollar gold yeah so it was 159 it was 259 per frank
[3:15:08.960 --> 3:15:14.240]  so when you take the 150 something out it was it came out to the number of 103 dollars per frank
[3:15:14.800 --> 3:15:22.000]  i mean that's gold at like 400 an ounce that's how good that deal is right now 800 686 2237

[3:15:46.480 --> 3:15:51.280]  an act she came out dressed in a in a minister that looked like she was wearing body armor followed
[3:15:51.280 --> 3:15:56.960]  by a full battalion of soldiers like the ones we saw in pics bird followed her on stage stood
[3:15:56.960 --> 3:16:01.120]  there with arms folded while the whole audience cheered you can go on youtube you can find
[3:16:01.120 --> 3:16:09.680]  that it's very concerning what's it called uh just uh youtube uh beyond say grammy 2010 performance
[3:16:10.480 --> 3:16:15.680]  it's really say grammy's 2010 well look the pentagon admits and the police departments
[3:16:15.680 --> 3:16:21.200]  admit they're spending huge amounts of taxpayer money where they just glorify black schemas glorify
[3:16:21.200 --> 3:16:27.280]  trips on the streets glorifying so they're just pushing it as if it's glamorous it's like the
[3:16:27.280 --> 3:16:33.600]  old bill hicks commercial the ultimate advertisement is just a hot blonde you know basically in a sexual
[3:16:33.600 --> 3:16:38.320]  pose with a coca-cola between her legs and you know people want that coca-cola because you know
[3:16:38.320 --> 3:16:43.920]  because it's got a woman involved and so you put a popular pop singer up and show this and it's just
[3:16:43.920 --> 3:16:50.480]  like men in black scheme ask her good beating people over the heads and it's just part of the
[3:16:50.480 --> 3:16:56.000]  degradation of society but no i haven't seen that but i've seen a lot of similar acclimation josh

[3:24:14.800 --> 3:24:23.920]  but first i want to play four short radio clips and analyze them from a youtube channel a listener
[3:24:23.920 --> 3:24:28.800]  of ours funk master five is the youtube channel and a lot of our listeners have been doing this
[3:24:28.800 --> 3:24:35.520]  mark dice you know one of the more modern pioneers of this who again we woke up it's like we woke up
[3:24:35.520 --> 3:24:40.240]  gary franche and the list goes on and on that's what i'm so proud of about this radio show is
[3:24:40.240 --> 3:24:47.040]  how many real bonafide leaders against tyranny we have spawned uh here with my films and the radio
[3:24:47.040 --> 3:24:55.760]  show but people are swarming savage hannity limbaugh beck and really changing what they cover
[3:24:55.760 --> 3:25:01.840]  making them admit world government but you listen to beck he says he wants to drink gallons of
[3:25:01.840 --> 3:25:08.480]  fluoride and and and calls the guy a kook when it's on record that fluoride eats your brain gives
[3:25:08.480 --> 3:25:15.920]  you bone cancer over 90 of the epa scientist a few years ago sent a letter to the epa sing take it out
[3:25:16.480 --> 3:25:21.680]  so i wanted to illustrate how three of the host tried to call people kooks and stuff and make
[3:25:21.680 --> 3:25:27.440]  jokes but how savage doesn't so let's go ahead i mean listen to the craziness of a caller who
[3:25:27.440 --> 3:25:34.000]  calls in about fluoride and what glenn beck has to say to him john in philadelphia listen to us on
[3:25:34.000 --> 3:25:39.280]  wph t you're on the glenn beck program glad thank you for taking my call sir this may seem extremely
[3:25:39.280 --> 3:25:43.600]  trivial considering everything that's going on but it's not something that's unpassionate about
[3:25:43.600 --> 3:25:50.240]  i studied and looked at the effects of fluoride in our water now the ada and the government
[3:25:50.240 --> 3:25:54.160]  agencies would have us believe that it's good for our teeth and with that being said okay if it's
[3:25:54.160 --> 3:26:01.280]  good for our teeth that's understandable why put it into our water we drink it uh it goes into our
[3:26:01.280 --> 3:26:09.040]  body and accumulates in our body drinking fluoride is the equivalent of drinking suntan lotion to
[3:26:09.040 --> 3:26:15.520]  prevent from getting a sunburn i don't understand if i could get one person in your audience to
[3:26:15.520 --> 3:26:20.960]  look up fluoride into at the stop use of fluoride i'll be happy if i could get you to investigate
[3:26:20.960 --> 3:26:26.400]  a look into fluoride and what it does in the effects of it i would be ecstatic i don't think i
[3:26:26.400 --> 3:26:32.560]  can make you ecstatic i mean i just don't think i mean you good god man the world is on fire you
[3:26:32.560 --> 3:26:39.440]  want me to stop and look why we're putting fluoride in our drinking water i'll drink buckets of
[3:26:39.440 --> 3:26:45.920]  fluoride man say that again you put a straw in a bucket of fluoride i'll be in i'll be a happy
[3:26:45.920 --> 3:26:50.960]  little sippy cup all day if that's the worst thing we got going for us it's not the worst thing we
[3:26:50.960 --> 3:26:56.240]  got going for us but it's the equivalent of mass medication and i know as you look into different
[3:26:56.240 --> 3:27:02.080]  government agencies over the years but i think it's a conspiracy no i think it was big business
[3:27:02.080 --> 3:27:06.720]  that somewhere along the line discovered that they can get rid of what the what equates to a
[3:27:06.720 --> 3:27:14.400]  poison it's not a natural organic they use the fluoride from the aluminum industry and use
[3:27:14.400 --> 3:27:20.080]  that and disperse it into our water look i may i just may i just quote scientific consensus nine
[3:27:20.080 --> 3:27:29.200]  and a ten doesn't agree scientific consensus just like global warming's a consensus no the
[3:27:29.200 --> 3:27:33.680]  american dental association says don't brush children's teeth with fluoride it gives them
[3:27:33.680 --> 3:27:39.520]  dental phorosis fractures the teeth and causes bone cancer that's a fact it's not funny but
[3:27:39.520 --> 3:27:44.880]  that's what beck does on every subject now let's go to sean hannity being asked a question and
[3:27:44.880 --> 3:27:50.240]  listen to how he responds a real issue is brought up and this is how hannity responds
[3:27:51.120 --> 3:27:55.280]  all right perry in dallas texas wb ap the news and talk to texas what's up perry
[3:27:56.080 --> 3:28:01.280]  hi how's it going sean i'm good sir how are you i'm doing all right i think you're a little off on
[3:28:01.280 --> 3:28:07.040]  uh um you know the way obama's handling the situation with iran uh i think particularly
[3:28:07.040 --> 3:28:11.600]  he's handling it good because he's keeping their gas prices down which is what he wants to be doing
[3:28:11.600 --> 3:28:15.360]  right now well again he's not doing anything to keep the gas prices down it went through 50
[3:28:15.360 --> 3:28:21.600]  some odd consecutive days of going up and if we see a price of a barrel of oil going up up up up up
[3:28:21.600 --> 3:28:26.160]  and again we're doing nothing to move towards independence well if you if you look at it this
[3:28:26.160 --> 3:28:31.760]  way i think some the biggest driving force behind that is the fact that mr obama along with
[3:28:31.760 --> 3:28:36.080]  bush and people like rip perry attend a builder bird conference where they plan to fix the process
[3:28:36.080 --> 3:28:42.000]  of gas to get their objective all right all right i i believe in conspiracies and i believe
[3:28:42.000 --> 3:28:48.240]  that hovering above the earth is a mother's ship uh so i'm sure to our phones danie norwin
[3:28:48.240 --> 3:28:54.880]  okay so it came out that builder bird did decide in 2008 to jack it up to 150 we made the prediction
[3:28:54.880 --> 3:28:59.760]  from the info inside it was proven right and then separately lindsay williams got the info
[3:28:59.760 --> 3:29:04.640]  that happened that was the call that happened builder bird groups reel but he equates it with
[3:29:04.640 --> 3:29:10.880]  a mother ship but not for long here's bloomberg maybe a secret banking cabal does run the world
[3:29:10.880 --> 3:29:16.400]  after all we have bandkine moon herman von rumpi gordon brown al gore all calling for global
[3:29:16.400 --> 3:29:24.480]  government and hannity has guessed on who tell him uh like dick morris that world government is here
[3:29:24.480 --> 3:29:28.640]  i mean it's being announced it's on the drudge report almost every day mainstream articles
[3:29:29.200 --> 3:29:32.720]  and now the drudge report links to us in the permanent links we just been like that for the
[3:29:32.720 --> 3:29:38.320]  last month check it i can't believe it i mean you guys are the kooks we're not talking about
[3:29:38.320 --> 3:29:46.400]  mother ships hovering above okay i mean look at that tactic mother ships from hannity
[3:29:47.040 --> 3:29:51.200]  bet wants to drink buckets of fluoride folks if you ate a teaspoon of fluoride it would
[3:29:51.200 --> 3:29:58.320]  kill you within an hour we're on the march the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio
[3:29:58.320 --> 3:30:05.920]  network this is alex jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator
[3:30:05.920 --> 3:30:11.040]  number one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill number two
[3:30:11.040 --> 3:30:15.920]  our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have
[3:30:15.920 --> 3:30:21.600]  it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming
[3:30:21.600 --> 3:30:26.000]  number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[3:30:26.000 --> 3:30:31.280]  and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous
[3:30:31.280 --> 3:30:35.920]  weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from
[3:30:35.920 --> 3:30:41.280]  weather related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and
[3:30:41.280 --> 3:30:45.680]  peace of mind folks i really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from science

[3:35:40.080 --> 3:35:45.280]  in the rough time right now yeah to build a bird i think that is conspiracy yeah it's on it could
[3:35:45.280 --> 3:35:49.120]  see you know there's certain words as soon as you hear it when a guy says build a burguin
[3:35:49.120 --> 3:35:54.320]  and you say can you explain that and they keep going you know that they in the middle of appearing
[3:35:54.320 --> 3:36:00.000]  measured it's like a trilateral commission yeah in the middle of appearing measured he's dropped a
[3:36:00.000 --> 3:36:05.360]  huge steaming ideological cow pie and you should move on from it all right that is going to show
[3:36:06.720 --> 3:36:12.720]  now see he told the listeners you need to move on from this this isn't real this is a pile of of
[3:36:12.720 --> 3:36:20.560]  cow poo and it it's an imaginary hamburger this guy is insane he calls in news eight austin

[3:37:08.320 --> 3:37:16.080]  i'll tell you on the savage nation go ahead please yeah um michael i'm very concerned about our
[3:37:16.080 --> 3:37:21.920]  country i just got them watching the cremation of care video on youtube it talks about what they
[3:37:21.920 --> 3:37:25.920]  really and it shows video evidence what they do at the bohemian grove the all these guys are saying
[3:37:25.920 --> 3:37:29.840]  oh whoa whoa whoa now you should you set me up with something or something you didn't want to
[3:37:29.840 --> 3:37:33.920]  really talk you want to talk about the bohemian grove so you're obsessed with the bohemian grove
[3:37:33.920 --> 3:37:38.880]  well i mean i saw video proof of what they do there and you know and so what is it you want
[3:37:38.880 --> 3:37:44.160]  america to do close down the bohemian grove well i think they should start to be a little more open
[3:37:44.160 --> 3:37:48.960]  to the fact that a lot of these guys agree about most of the issues behind closed doors they may
[3:37:48.960 --> 3:37:53.680]  fact like they're opposed when you know they're in the public eye but it's all in act who is in the
[3:37:53.680 --> 3:37:59.840]  bohemian grove are they bohemians or are they well you have guys like uh sports beggars been
[3:37:59.840 --> 3:38:05.520]  there bush uh newt gingrich has gone there how come i haven't been invited i'd like to get naked
[3:38:05.520 --> 3:38:12.720]  in the woods with a bunch of fat old republicans why am i not invited i can think of no better
[3:38:12.720 --> 3:38:18.080]  vacation this august than to be invited to get naked and get down with some fat naked republicans
[3:38:18.080 --> 3:38:24.400]  like newt gingrich what a great summer vacation that would be well statue also what else do they
[3:38:24.400 --> 3:38:28.480]  do they drink what they drink blood i mean what else are you suggesting well the interesting thing
[3:38:28.480 --> 3:38:32.560]  is there's a video on youtube where you can see it i mean they they show the whole little ceremony
[3:38:32.560 --> 3:38:36.800]  they do let's not go into it i'm not interested in that part can we do this in a family way what
[3:38:36.800 --> 3:38:43.680]  do they do there that upsets you well they uh they do uh a mock sacrifice in front of an owl statue
[3:38:45.520 --> 3:38:48.960]  that's cute that's almost innocent and what is it that they sacrifice
[3:38:50.640 --> 3:38:56.560]  no but what do they kill well it's a mock sacrifice of a human being if they uh it's
[3:38:56.560 --> 3:39:02.320]  like a dummy if they wouldn't dummy wouldn't they use a crash dummy from an old test that they
[3:39:02.320 --> 3:39:07.440]  they've done a short take against from one of the departments he has they get a crash dummy and
[3:39:07.440 --> 3:39:16.160]  they sacrifice it i don't think so i mean it has uh uh origins in paganism and is there sex come on
[3:39:16.160 --> 3:39:19.760]  let's get down to it is there wild sex in the woods while the wives are away is that what you're
[3:39:19.760 --> 3:39:29.200]  applying the thought of it with newt gingrich is enough to make me puke savage all right folks
[3:39:30.560 --> 3:39:34.320]  the point is savage lives in san francisco he knows when they're meeting it's at the end of
[3:39:34.320 --> 3:39:40.160]  july august he knows that he just wants to savage can't stand not showing people that he knows about
[3:39:40.160 --> 3:39:46.320]  it the other host would just say flying saucers doesn't exist well here is the film dark secrets
[3:39:46.320 --> 3:39:55.440]  inside bohemian grove and the order of death two films the 2000 infiltration um uh the other
[3:39:55.440 --> 3:40:04.880]  fellow that infiltrated in 2003 and they set him up and set him to prison for it that is all in here
[3:40:04.880 --> 3:40:09.440]  what mark jones i'm trying to remember his name poor guys we're getting out soon the point is the
[3:40:09.440 --> 3:40:15.840]  order of death our entire society is ruled and controlled by deepa cultist director alex jones
[3:40:16.800 --> 3:40:24.880]  two films on one dvd info wars dot com everybody should see this churches should see this people
[3:40:24.880 --> 3:40:32.160]  should know what's really going on inside this facility and how the two bushes attended and
[3:40:32.160 --> 3:40:38.080]  the things that go on there because the entire illusion of who they are and what they are
[3:40:38.080 --> 3:40:43.840]  are is shattered by these two documentary films one's an hour and a half long the other's 46 minutes
[3:40:43.840 --> 3:40:52.080]  long two films one dvd dark secrets inside bohemian grove you want to wake people up
[3:40:52.080 --> 3:40:57.280]  this will wake up christians ladies and gentlemen this will wake them up to their republican party
[3:40:57.280 --> 3:41:09.440]  this is like holy water or a wooden stake to count Dracula oh man there is so much going on there is
[3:41:09.440 --> 3:41:18.720]  so much happening um you know i did probably six hours this weekend of research friday saturday night
[3:41:19.520 --> 3:41:24.800]  for some reason i hadn't really studied what monsanto was up to in about a year
[3:41:24.800 --> 3:41:29.840]  and i knew how wicked this company was and all the evil things they've been involved
[3:41:29.840 --> 3:41:35.520]  in from dioxin dumps in major cities like aniston alabama to knowing agent orange was
[3:41:35.520 --> 3:41:42.320]  going to kill people and all of those reports to the gmo food and i knew that in their own
[3:41:42.320 --> 3:41:48.640]  studies and in countless studies i'd seen over the years that the different corn varieties that
[3:41:48.640 --> 3:41:56.000]  produce their own pesticide the corn grows its own pesticide so bugs won't eat it and the german
[3:41:56.000 --> 3:42:02.000]  studies about this bt corn variety bees will still get the pollen and they go and die and that's
[3:42:02.720 --> 3:42:08.160]  reportedly one of the big reasons they're dying and so i ended up spending three hours one night
[3:42:08.160 --> 3:42:14.080]  three hours another night my wife's like don't you ever stop just reading and reading and reading
[3:42:14.080 --> 3:42:18.080]  and reading and then i get up here on air how do you present six hours of research and just a
[3:42:18.080 --> 3:42:24.880]  few minutes but i'm gonna get some guests back on about this because monsanto is exploding it was
[3:42:24.880 --> 3:42:34.320]  ruled a corporation of the year by forbs they are over 70 of all gmo crops and they're doing
[3:42:34.320 --> 3:42:39.680]  sugar beets and just everything else now i mean they're they're now rolling out aggressively
[3:42:40.400 --> 3:42:47.280]  every major crop there is and they're like look you can spray weed killer on this and our plant
[3:42:47.280 --> 3:42:56.480]  doesn't die but it absorbs it and no bugs can eat it because we've engineered pesticides into it
[3:42:57.360 --> 3:43:02.400]  and then all these prestigious universities and facilities tested and they feed it to rats
[3:43:04.320 --> 3:43:09.360]  and they get liver failure and kidney failure and die in mass and other companies with their
[3:43:09.360 --> 3:43:13.840]  potatoes and rice and in fact i meant to print this it didn't print for some reason google
[3:43:13.840 --> 3:43:20.480]  google it was uh la times was the first one i saw a few years ago u n well well the u n is
[3:43:20.480 --> 3:43:27.280]  it has is now looking at shipping rice to the third world that sterilizes men but i'm from
[3:43:27.280 --> 3:43:38.160]  remember the exact headline it was a gmo rice contraceptive for men give me that but the point
[3:43:38.160 --> 3:43:46.000]  is is that that's what these major monsanto crops in every study sterilize or reduce fertility in
[3:43:46.000 --> 3:43:53.200]  the mice in the guinea pigs and so it just so happens to do that too but separately other
[3:43:53.200 --> 3:43:57.280]  companies have got these systems right out in the open and they're saying we're going to make you
[3:43:57.280 --> 3:44:04.080]  eat this and birth weights are down sperm counts down by over 85 percent infertilities off the
[3:44:04.080 --> 3:44:10.880]  charts all these different disorders of the intestines autoimmune responses definitely
[3:44:10.880 --> 3:44:17.200]  linked to vaccines and gmo crops and then i was reading all the new crops they've got coming out
[3:44:18.240 --> 3:44:22.000]  and i would go to the patent office and read what what it does
[3:44:23.440 --> 3:44:28.240]  here's one from uh july 20th last year but now this is being planted all over the us
[3:44:28.240 --> 3:44:36.880]  monsanto dow chemical when approval for modified corn and now it's rolling out nationwide smart
[3:44:36.880 --> 3:44:46.800]  stacks corn and it says here that it has eight genetic traits in it six of them pesticide that
[3:44:46.800 --> 3:44:52.480]  kills different bugs now now listen i'm not a rocket scientist but i have all the studies but
[3:44:52.480 --> 3:45:00.000]  but you start eating six pesticides that are grown in the corn so bugs can't eat it
[3:45:00.000 --> 3:45:07.440]  bugs can't eat it you know you don't go to the cupboard pull out raid and go oh my god well
[3:45:07.440 --> 3:45:12.720]  you know it kills bugs but it doesn't hurt me it's corn you know a can of poison oh you know it's
[3:45:12.720 --> 3:45:18.640]  corn i mean you know it's not hard but the way they twist it is they say well it's a naturally
[3:45:18.640 --> 3:45:24.080]  occurring pesticide yeah that thousands of times lower concentrations of fungus that's poisonous
[3:45:24.080 --> 3:45:29.600]  tends to grow on corn that sometimes happens to keep bugs from eating it but you don't make
[3:45:29.600 --> 3:45:35.120]  it a thousand to five thousand depending on the variety stronger in the corn and then we're eating
[3:45:36.880 --> 3:45:41.520]  but it doesn't matter cops can dress up in black uniforms and you know be at the grammies or the
[3:45:41.520 --> 3:45:50.960]  Emmys or whatever and and and go back to that video again but i guess this was the grammies
[3:45:53.040 --> 3:46:00.000]  and worshiping police in black uniforms stomping around on stage with the beautiful woman i mean
[3:46:00.000 --> 3:46:05.680]  it's just it's just it's just hey let me ask the cops something do you like being sterilized do you
[3:46:05.680 --> 3:46:11.680]  like being fed poison well you don't care you're like i feel powerful they gave me a black uniform see
[3:46:11.680 --> 3:46:17.120]  i mean we're all in this together the elite are attacking all of us and it's so stupid that we're
[3:46:17.120 --> 3:46:25.840]  even fighting with each other that i was reading about the corn what's the problem with smart stacks
[3:46:28.480 --> 3:46:32.720]  and it has the canadian government's refusal to even allow it you know the thing is the rest of
[3:46:32.720 --> 3:46:39.120]  the world won't allow this stuff but the us oh yes and you want bovine growth hormone synthetic
[3:46:39.120 --> 3:46:44.960]  wonder why our girls are eight feet tall or whatever you know uh you wonder why uh six
[3:46:44.960 --> 3:46:48.800]  year old girls are going into puberty and when they go to the doctor and they say oh you're full
[3:46:48.800 --> 3:46:53.760]  of hormones from all the food and stuff uh we'll give you other hormones to suppress that they
[3:46:53.760 --> 3:47:00.880]  don't tell you stop eating it smart stacks is genetically engineered g or genetically modified
[3:47:00.880 --> 3:47:06.400]  corn that is unique because it has eight g e genetic engineered traits combined or stacked
[3:47:06.400 --> 3:47:12.320]  together it's down here in this area the article of you're giving a document shot for prison
[3:47:12.320 --> 3:47:20.960]  planet dot tv viewers this is this is the area right here smart stack is a genetically engineered g
[3:47:20.960 --> 3:47:26.800]  e or genetically modified g m corn that is unique because it has eight g e trades combined or stacked
[3:47:26.800 --> 3:47:35.360]  together six for insect resistance bt and two for herbicide tolerance there are some stacked g
[3:47:35.360 --> 3:47:39.520]  e trait crops in the market already but these have only three traits each
[3:47:44.320 --> 3:47:48.640]  and it says it will be the largest commercial launch of g e corn because it will replace
[3:47:49.840 --> 3:47:54.800]  a lot of existing g e corn on the market and then i went to the patent office i went to
[3:47:54.800 --> 3:48:01.280]  bloomberg i read all the information about it meanwhile every time i mentioned the fact
[3:48:03.360 --> 3:48:11.120]  that the un has built giant seed vaults and when you read it's the Rockefeller Rothschilds
[3:48:12.000 --> 3:48:18.240]  and others are funding it it's ap Reuters bbc people send me emails saying that's not happening
[3:48:18.240 --> 3:48:25.680]  that doesn't exist did you guys ever find the spermicide corn that's it's everywhere uh
[3:48:25.680 --> 3:48:30.640]  hell i'll do it right now i don't let me i'm not saying you guys can't find it but let me try um
[3:48:34.800 --> 3:48:43.040]  new rice new rice contraceptive for men they call it a contraceptive instead of a sterilant
[3:48:43.040 --> 3:48:57.680]  new rice contraceptive for men oh i didn't put a space
[3:49:00.960 --> 3:49:02.400]  i'm obsessed with information
[3:49:02.400 --> 3:49:12.000]  and the contraceptive skin patch rice you know modified sequence counter
[3:49:12.800 --> 3:49:17.600]  septive this is driving me crazy i ran into this everywhere without even looking for it
[3:49:18.960 --> 3:49:25.520]  and it matters there try this try un seed vault
[3:49:27.520 --> 3:49:31.920]  un seed vault they've got them all over the world but it'll show you the arctic one do that real
[3:49:31.920 --> 3:49:35.760]  fast un seed vault will show people that because they don't believe it's real
[3:49:37.440 --> 3:49:39.760]  you found one about corn that sterilizes people
[3:49:41.440 --> 3:49:45.120]  well print it for me then bubba it's always worse than we even thought
[3:49:45.120 --> 3:49:51.360]  but um somebody on twitter find it and send it to our twitter account we can all work together
[3:49:51.920 --> 3:49:59.440]  if we work together there it is uh it says spermicides and genetically modified crops
[3:49:59.440 --> 3:50:03.040]  there you go but that's a blog let's scroll down and see what their source is
[3:50:05.200 --> 3:50:09.280]  what is the source what is the linky on there it should have a linky
[3:50:11.200 --> 3:50:17.360]  that says from see see that pink link right there that'll that'll tell you where it uh

[3:50:31.280 --> 3:50:37.040]  need to understand this is real i mean there is so much happening and the general public is just
[3:50:37.040 --> 3:50:44.000]  totally unaware of what is happening when we come back we'll show you the un seed vault
[3:50:44.000 --> 3:50:48.640]  you can pick anything bbc in fact i see you guys a video over the weekend you guys have
[3:50:48.640 --> 3:50:56.640]  the video of the un tour of the seed vault at the arctic circle we have it so we'll play it to margus

[3:52:42.160 --> 3:52:47.920]  the checkout to today seems like nobody does care and right now in washington dc we have seen

[3:54:07.440 --> 3:54:15.760]  being called the world's doomsday vault herald its imminent opening surrounded by miles and miles
[3:54:15.760 --> 3:54:22.480]  of icy wilderness the spalbard global seed vault has been built to withstand nearly every catastrophe
[3:54:22.480 --> 3:54:29.920]  its precious contents millions of seeds which could prove indispensable to our survival the the
[3:54:29.920 --> 3:54:35.920]  vault is secure against flooding we're well above sea level if the ice on the poles should melt
[3:54:35.920 --> 3:54:45.280]  it's safe against the earthquakes we're 130 meters inside the mountain so we should be very safe
[3:54:47.920 --> 3:54:53.760]  yeah tomorrow i'll try to play the whole clip the point is the u n the roth childs the rocker
[3:54:53.760 --> 3:54:58.400]  fellers they talk about it in the article are funding all these seed vaults while they buy up
[3:54:58.400 --> 3:55:04.640]  all the regular natural seeds and won't sell them to anybody monsanto is doing that and then selling
[3:55:04.640 --> 3:55:11.600]  all these gmo crops that in every case we research it hurts your fertility or sterilizes you and

[3:55:16.960 --> 3:55:24.480]  with toxins i mean ladies and gentlemen we're living in a science fiction nightmare and we
[3:55:24.480 --> 3:55:29.120]  better get the general public and the enforcers to realize they're all under attack by this
[3:55:29.840 --> 3:55:33.200]  now i want to close out the show haven't had anerson on the last three minutes because
[3:55:33.200 --> 3:55:40.400]  ted huge response yesterday obviously people wanting the what is it 157 dollar value of
[3:55:40.400 --> 3:55:46.720]  free year subscription hard copy or digital comes out twice a week of the international
[3:55:46.720 --> 3:55:52.960]  forecaster which is 30 40 50 60 pages depending on what issue from bob Chapman really key info
[3:55:53.520 --> 3:55:56.160]  a lot of it our stories from info wars and present plan that's part of it
[3:55:56.160 --> 3:56:03.200]  um you're offering that free when people get a frank for 259 dollars if you do the math
[3:56:03.200 --> 3:56:09.920]  whenever we did it yesterday that comes out to 100 100 and uh three dollars per frank
[3:56:09.920 --> 3:56:16.160]  so that's gold at basically 400 an ounce with an 1100 and something today what it's up like
[3:56:16.160 --> 3:56:22.000]  eight nine bucks last time i checked five minutes ago ted yeah gold is up again today and uh
[3:56:22.000 --> 3:56:28.080]  actually the frank's even on my internet sites now are up over 260 dollars a piece so this is a
[3:56:28.080 --> 3:56:33.600]  special that is clearly exclusive to the show right now alex uh just due to the fact that the
[3:56:33.600 --> 3:56:40.080]  market has gone up as much as it has today gold has seen a high of 1119 dollars the dollars dropping
[3:56:40.080 --> 3:56:44.880]  again that's why it's happening this little rally that we had just after the christmas new year's
[3:56:44.880 --> 3:56:51.040]  break seems to be breaking after the uh albama announcement that there's going to be a 1.56
[3:56:51.040 --> 3:56:58.320]  trillion deficit with this new uh uh stimulus package so you bought gold at the 1070 level
[3:56:58.320 --> 3:57:03.600]  and you're selling it at an even lower price than it was then when the market is 11,000
[3:57:04.720 --> 3:57:14.640]  what is it 11,000 what i mean well 1111 today 1119 dollars 1119 yeah so yeah so that's a super
[3:57:14.640 --> 3:57:19.520]  deal and you get i mean no doubt the frank's of the best deal and you get a free international
[3:57:19.520 --> 3:57:25.040]  forecaster for a year yeah a full subscription for a year which is 159 dollars and actually
[3:57:25.040 --> 3:57:33.040]  with the frank being at 255 36 it's about 98 dollars per per coin uh after you could consider
[3:57:33.040 --> 3:57:38.480]  the subscription yeah i'm all going from memory here so i apologize i said it was 103 it's it's
[3:57:38.480 --> 3:57:44.800]  98 dollars uh so calculated that comes out to what 400 an ounce roughly well it's a fifth of an ounce
[3:57:44.800 --> 3:57:50.240]  so it's closer to 500 it's 480 but yeah it's a really good deal i'm just estimating here live on
[3:57:50.240 --> 3:57:55.440]  air yeah it it is just a fabulous deal but the thing about it is you need to be informed the
[3:57:55.440 --> 3:58:03.680]  international forecasters a great way to do that and all you got to do is call 1 800 686 2237 again
