[00:00.000 --> 00:11.760]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.760 --> 00:19.320]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.320 --> 00:29.440]  Texas Alex Jones African Middle Eastern Asian European countries are blocking
[00:29.440 --> 00:34.520]  down their borders beefing up surveillance on foreigners flying in
[00:34.520 --> 00:40.760]  here in the United States we're paralyzed by political correctness we're not even
[00:40.760 --> 00:46.840]  allowed to control the border and Geraldo Rivera and MSNBC and others say
[00:46.840 --> 00:53.200]  it's racist if you're worried about Ebola coming here this is literally like a
[00:53.200 --> 00:58.120]  spider biting a bug to paralyze it before it sucks it dry political correctness
[00:58.120 --> 01:04.560]  is Soviet style mind control in this country
[01:04.560 --> 01:10.720]  meanwhile there's German news headlines saying Putin reportedly thinks that
[01:10.720 --> 01:16.120]  World War 3 will start but there will be a huge war with the United States and
[01:16.120 --> 01:21.200]  hey I just want stability I just don't want to have World War 3 I'm not pro
[01:21.200 --> 01:29.000]  Russia I'm pro survival and the West is run by globalist who are building a
[01:29.000 --> 01:37.080]  gulag archipelago here in this country I'm a hardcore libertarian constitutionalist
[01:37.080 --> 01:43.360]  paleo conservative whatever you want to call it and I mourn for my nation as
[01:43.360 --> 01:48.280]  its borders are collapsed as our sovereignty is destroyed as we're
[01:48.280 --> 01:52.800]  spied on illegally as the government announces libertarians conservatives
[01:52.800 --> 01:57.560]  veterans gun owners as the number one enemy and prepares for illegal war
[01:57.560 --> 02:02.520]  against us and meanwhile I have the Democratic Party attacking me every day
[02:02.520 --> 02:10.240]  through their organs and I have the neocon defense contractor media with
[02:10.240 --> 02:16.680]  well-known establishment shills that I won't even name running around saying
[02:16.680 --> 02:24.200]  I'm a KGB agent when I pointed out that our government the criminal sectors of
[02:24.200 --> 02:29.440]  it was openly funding al-Qaeda and the Taliban as a pretext to take our
[02:29.440 --> 02:34.240]  liberty they claimed that I was secretly trained the same people in jihadi
[02:34.240 --> 02:40.760]  camps and the propaganda is so dumbed down and so naked and it doesn't even
[02:40.760 --> 02:45.800]  work anymore but the system just goes forward with it but I think about how
[02:45.800 --> 02:54.600]  dishonorable these people are that do this and then I saw a Navy seal I wrote
[02:54.600 --> 02:59.400]  his name down he's been on the show he's a great guy exposing Obama preparing
[02:59.400 --> 03:04.000]  for martial law just search Navy seals as Obama preparing for dictatorship he
[03:04.000 --> 03:08.240]  was on like six months ago talking about how they probably killed the Navy
[03:08.240 --> 03:13.960]  seals to cover up the fake bin Laden raid really good guy and I saw him on
[03:13.960 --> 03:22.840]  Fox News I wrote Benjamin Smith believing Chris Kyle and saying Ventura is
[03:22.840 --> 03:32.200]  basically guilty of treason and he looks so sincere on TV and and that's the
[03:32.200 --> 03:37.480]  buddy factor because he was friends with Chris Kyle so he believed his buddy and
[03:37.480 --> 03:41.520]  you kind of respect that at one level because Ventura is my buddy so then I
[03:41.520 --> 03:53.440]  back him that's what it comes down to but the truth is it isn't about Ventura
[03:53.440 --> 04:01.960]  it's about the Psyop that they could do this to anybody get somebody who's
[04:01.960 --> 04:07.480]  respected to lie about you then that person gets killed mysteriously before
[04:07.480 --> 04:13.160]  it go to trial and the media won't say that news corps running the whole deal
[04:13.160 --> 04:20.760]  Fox News is a division of that and that it's an insurance policy that pays it
[04:20.760 --> 04:26.840]  and Ventura doesn't even need the money Ventura did some land deals on a big
[04:26.840 --> 04:30.640]  ranch he bought where he made a ton of money a bunch of other stuff I mean
[04:30.640 --> 04:34.200]  Ventura did not do what they said and it's meant to destroy his name and then
[04:34.200 --> 04:39.920]  they spin it like he's going after a widow and he's a bully when he filed the
[04:39.920 --> 04:44.520]  suit before Chris Kyle was dead and the Psyop even works on people like
[04:44.520 --> 04:51.520]  Benjamin Smith and again it's bigger than Ventura or Chris Kyle it's how these
[04:51.520 --> 04:58.560]  Psyops work it's like the kickoff for war with Russia it's just based on fraud

[08:16.880 --> 08:32.120]  it is the 31st day of July 2014 I'm your host Alex Jones and we are truly
[08:32.120 --> 08:39.320]  riding the lightning of tyranny as it falls from the heavens thrown from the
[08:39.320 --> 08:48.120]  hand of Lucifer we're here Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. central
[08:48.120 --> 08:54.040]  standard time the tyranny is coming down the god of this world the power of the
[08:54.040 --> 09:00.680]  air the power of the propaganda of the new world order is intensifying the
[09:00.680 --> 09:07.000]  great deceptions being stacked upon deceptions until the lie becomes a
[09:07.000 --> 09:12.480]  synthetic false consciousness reality that is what we face ladies and gentlemen
[09:12.480 --> 09:19.360]  on this live Thursday worldwide transmission we have in studio coming
[09:19.360 --> 09:27.480]  up in the third hour the Obama phone lady he gave us a phone he's going to do
[09:27.480 --> 09:31.360]  more she was here a year ago to be interviewed for the Obama deception to
[09:31.360 --> 09:37.200]  that I never released now so much has happened I'm remaking the entire film and
[09:37.200 --> 09:42.120]  I have decided that I am just going to do what I did with the first Obama
[09:42.120 --> 09:48.160]  deception films like in game took me a year and a half to make working on it
[09:48.160 --> 09:54.280]  constantly it's a three-hour film it's really three films other films took you
[09:54.280 --> 10:00.360]  know three four six months it varied this film I've been working on Obama
[10:00.360 --> 10:08.880]  deception too for five years and I literally have edited four or five
[10:08.880 --> 10:13.720]  hours that's film but I'm going to go back take the most powerful parts of
[10:13.720 --> 10:18.920]  that and then put new developments in it and then I'm just going to sit there and
[10:18.920 --> 10:23.520]  lock myself I've done this before I've just got a lot of family stuff going on
[10:23.520 --> 10:29.000]  and other operations but I'm going to have to lock myself for about two weeks
[10:29.000 --> 10:32.960]  in an editing room every day when I got off the air do nothing I'll be like
[10:32.960 --> 10:38.320]  Howard Hughes in his hotel room literally I've done this before slept on the
[10:38.320 --> 10:41.720]  couch in there we've got couches in the editing base we haven't used them in
[10:41.720 --> 10:45.120]  years because I haven't been working like that in years and I'm just gonna
[10:45.120 --> 10:50.120]  sleep up here we're gonna just slap it together that happened with Obama
[10:50.120 --> 10:55.840]  deception the first one that was made in one month one month on top of the radio
[10:55.840 --> 11:03.200]  show everything else we were doing I made that with about three people in one
[11:03.200 --> 11:15.720]  month and so there will be an Obama deception to my problem is I obsessed
[11:15.720 --> 11:21.280]  over trying to make a super powerful film and and I don't have words to
[11:21.280 --> 11:26.360]  describe how evil the system is and how much bad they're doing and then I want
[11:26.360 --> 11:32.440]  to obsess on proving every point I make until the film ends up being five hours
[11:32.440 --> 11:41.280]  long it needs to be 90 minutes super high-powered and just crystallize and
[11:41.280 --> 11:46.400]  condense the information together to transcend Obama but the idea of
[11:46.400 --> 11:51.240]  collectivism versus liberty the idea of government by conquest government by
[11:51.240 --> 11:59.520]  gang government by combine by monopoly versus liberty and those ideas the film
[11:59.520 --> 12:04.240]  is very similar the film is basically done haven't worked on six months just
[12:04.240 --> 12:11.920]  sitting back there is basically Dinesh Jesus America but more hardcore because
[12:11.920 --> 12:17.120]  it's the truth I knew what would be in Dinesh Jesus film when he was on six
[12:17.120 --> 12:20.960]  months ago before he got indicted I was predicting on air what it was about he
[12:20.960 --> 12:26.280]  was saying yes that's very uncanny that you you know what's in the film and I
[12:26.280 --> 12:39.560]  said no it's not hold on one second hello hello hey how you doing I'm
[12:39.560 --> 12:44.960]  fantastic I'm gonna go to break here in just a few minutes can I well guys go
[12:44.960 --> 12:53.800]  it okay well you're so sweet to you're so sweet to call me right back okay okay
[12:53.800 --> 12:58.560]  I'll call you in six minutes all right thank you bye I had to take tag as I've
[12:58.560 --> 13:02.120]  been playing phone tag with Ventura and his wife for days and so I knew that was
[13:02.120 --> 13:07.720]  them and I he said he come on my show radio first once the verdict came out
[13:07.720 --> 13:12.560]  and then I just played phone tag and never got it done and then I had my crew
[13:12.560 --> 13:15.680]  go into the public system they were playing phone tag so that's why I did
[13:15.680 --> 13:19.840]  that excuse me I don't usually do that I've done that a few other times on air
[13:19.840 --> 13:24.160]  like if my mom calls me or something but that was anyway side issue what was I
[13:24.160 --> 13:29.120]  getting into I have this tendency ladies and gentlemen to go off down rabbit
[13:29.120 --> 13:34.840]  trails and I've gone off into discussing of the Obama deception to that we're
[13:34.840 --> 13:39.520]  just gonna put out I have not put out a film since fall the Republic five years
[13:39.520 --> 13:44.200]  ago that was my film we put out strategic relocation that's a
[13:44.200 --> 13:54.120]  documentary but I'm the host of it but I didn't make it really the office did
[13:54.120 --> 13:58.200]  the news crew did and that's not really what you call a documentary it's more
[13:58.200 --> 14:05.680]  of a presentation slash documentary but I will put it out let me reset here guys
[14:05.680 --> 14:10.000]  print me all the Ventura numbers because they she just gave me another one to
[14:10.000 --> 14:14.000]  call and I need to call their back phone number and I forget which one it is
[14:14.000 --> 14:17.320]  I'll know when I see it just print me all the numbers shell phones everything
[14:17.320 --> 14:20.480]  just bring it in there cuz I gotta call her during the break sorry I don't mean
[14:20.480 --> 14:22.880]  to mention that on air it's just that then and I'll go to break for four
[14:22.880 --> 14:28.920]  minutes and won't have time to call and get that set up okay literally this is a
[14:28.920 --> 14:33.680]  totally transparent radio show we could do a reality TV show but have it be
[14:33.680 --> 14:38.960]  live because reality TV is not really reality TV in most cases and just see
[14:38.960 --> 14:42.480]  you see the behind the scenes and I mean what goes on here on air is what's
[14:42.480 --> 14:47.520]  going on off air because I have the weird position of being actually the main
[14:47.520 --> 14:51.520]  producer of my own radio show with the other sub producers that do a great job
[14:51.520 --> 14:55.160]  and trying to run everything else at the same time and I've tried to turn over
[14:55.160 --> 15:00.960]  control of a lot of stuff to people so that I can get more done and we're in
[15:00.960 --> 15:05.480]  that process right now so I'm almost having a managerial meeting here on
[15:05.480 --> 15:09.880]  air and I will now segue out of that let's restart the radio show ladies and
[15:09.880 --> 15:20.480]  gentlemen he gave us a phone he's going to do more she's really a very sweet
[15:20.480 --> 15:26.160]  lady I enjoy going out to dinner with her and her husband Harvey and she's
[15:26.160 --> 15:32.560]  really hurt that she thought that her ship had come in she works as a maid
[15:32.560 --> 15:41.040]  cleaning up to five houses a day and got hit with the Obama payroll tax and
[15:41.040 --> 15:47.400]  didn't want to throw him under the bus on TV or radio but actually got tears in
[15:47.400 --> 15:53.600]  her eyes before she left when she was here about a year ago and she said you
[15:53.600 --> 15:58.000]  know I I'll get her talk about this today I'll bring this up she said you
[15:58.000 --> 16:02.080]  know I really been working really hard and I really thought he was gonna help
[16:02.080 --> 16:08.200]  us and she had tears in her eyes and I just thought about how sweet she is but
[16:08.200 --> 16:14.000]  all childlike folks are that that I don't mean that in a mean way but innocent
[16:14.000 --> 16:28.360]  that by into these kleptocrats fraud and lies that's what it comes down to and so
[16:28.360 --> 16:32.800]  I think she's gonna feature even more prominently she was already in the
[16:32.800 --> 16:37.640]  Obama deception to that sitting back there basically done that I'm not gonna
[16:37.640 --> 16:42.440]  release I guess I could release that and then call it Obama deception three
[16:42.440 --> 16:47.000]  that's an idea release the Obama deception to like Hollywood does sometimes
[16:47.000 --> 16:52.640]  and then two months later release the third part that's the brand new film but
[16:52.640 --> 16:58.360]  now I'm not gonna do that so this is not a scripted radio show ladies and
[16:58.360 --> 17:04.800]  gentlemen this is not a scripted radio show there's no teleprompters here
[17:04.800 --> 17:10.800]  there's no talking points here and so sometimes I again segue off let me give
[17:10.800 --> 17:15.480]  you the headlines here that are coming up the Ebola situation when I was reading
[17:15.480 --> 17:20.600]  these headlines this morning from mainstream news sources sent chills up my
[17:20.600 --> 17:30.440]  spine Ebola spiders web of infection is growing as hunt continues for 30,000
[17:30.440 --> 17:38.080]  victims of outbreak 30,000 victims the previous top pandemics with the stuff in
[17:38.080 --> 17:45.040]  African countries were a couple thousand I mean this is getting crazy US Peace Corps
[17:45.040 --> 17:50.520]  volunteers exposed to Ebola CBS News Liberia shut schools considers
[17:50.520 --> 17:54.880]  quarantine to curb Ebola African countries are locking down their
[17:54.880 --> 17:59.520]  borders but if we even mention controlling our borders so Ebola doesn't
[17:59.520 --> 18:06.080]  get in Geraldo Rivera who I don't even want to attack he's told me he's
[18:06.080 --> 18:10.480]  listens to the show sometimes and you know he's been friendly to me on and
[18:10.480 --> 18:13.800]  off air we've heard him say he's been a listener on air I don't agree with a lot
[18:13.800 --> 18:18.320]  of his policies but I grew up watching Geraldo Rivera and I don't want to
[18:18.320 --> 18:25.040]  attack Geraldo Rivera but I mean it's pure bull Boston hospitals training staff
[18:25.040 --> 18:29.400]  to watch for signs of Ebola virus CBS News I guess that's because they're
[18:29.400 --> 18:35.960]  racist in Boston it's like if you don't want Chinese chicken being shipped in
[18:35.960 --> 18:41.200]  that's been rotten for 13 days and then gets past chemicals put on it that
[18:41.200 --> 18:45.800]  makes people sick I've even seen news articles saying is the backlash against
[18:45.800 --> 18:50.440]  Chinese chicken racist feel like if you caught a Chinese person robbing your
[18:50.440 --> 18:56.840]  garage they'd say on the news he called the police because he's racist it's like
[18:56.840 --> 18:59.520]  when I caught two black guys being paid off by the little Democratic gun

[24:34.320 --> 24:38.280]  Obama caved into China and the beef industry's demands to process our
[24:38.280 --> 24:44.280]  homegrown chickens in China that's right our chickens will be shipped to China to
[24:44.280 --> 24:49.840]  be processed and then sent right back to us to consume US senator Chuck Schumer
[24:49.840 --> 24:54.720]  paraphrase a USDA report indicating that China will likely be allowed to
[24:54.720 --> 24:59.640]  directly import their own chickens into this country so you'll be glad to know

[25:15.520 --> 25:19.440]  information about where certain foods come from what about products like this
[25:19.440 --> 25:24.120]  it lists three countries of origin this means that either the meat used
[25:24.120 --> 25:28.440]  originated in different countries or the animals were born and raised in one
[25:28.440 --> 25:33.280]  country say Canada or Mexico and then slaughtered in the United States and
[25:33.280 --> 25:36.960]  when that is fully underway we can expect tens of thousands of US jobs
[25:36.960 --> 25:42.000]  destroyed as they are shipped over to a country that passed off rat meat as land
[25:42.000 --> 25:48.560]  but it's not just chicken in September of 2013 NBC reported that shareholders of
[25:48.560 --> 25:53.680]  Smithfield Foods approved a plan to sell the world's largest pork producer and
[25:53.680 --> 25:58.880]  processor to a Chinese company the US already imports four billion pounds of
[25:58.880 --> 26:03.280]  food per year from China suddenly raising backyard chickens doesn't sound
[26:03.280 --> 26:09.920]  like such a bad idea until they make that illegal too for info wars comm John
[26:09.920 --> 26:15.520]  bound reporting now again we were talking during the break so I reared
[26:15.520 --> 26:20.440]  that from six months ago about how incredibly racist we all are here at
[26:20.440 --> 26:26.360]  info wars comm for criticizing Chinese chicken because that's come out in the
[26:26.360 --> 26:31.520]  Chinese press that it's just the West doesn't like Chinese people this is what
[26:31.520 --> 26:35.920]  political correctness is that you don't respond to the fact that your chickens
[26:35.920 --> 26:41.600]  tainted which then came out two weeks ago that McDonald's Pizza Hut and a big
[26:41.600 --> 26:48.880]  other group of food chains are buying chicken and other meat products that are
[26:48.880 --> 26:55.600]  rocking rocking that's why they process it that's why they put all the fillers
[26:55.600 --> 27:00.920]  in it and all the chemicals and irradiated but it's still very toxic
[27:00.920 --> 27:07.120]  ladies and gentlemen in many cases now how do you change the subject you just
[27:07.120 --> 27:11.840]  say that we're anti-China remember back when Clinton was giving them Laurel and
[27:11.840 --> 27:18.080]  Hughes technology I was on the air in 96 97 98 when the only media that would
[27:18.080 --> 27:22.760]  criticize Obama was the Washington Times and Matt drudge of drudge report
[27:22.760 --> 27:26.720]  calm just giving credit works to people ask why is the show drudge obsessed I
[27:26.720 --> 27:31.440]  mean who isn't I mean it gets more traffic the New York Times hits the new
[27:31.440 --> 27:36.440]  New York Times and it's promoting freedom and they would expose the
[27:36.440 --> 27:41.000]  missile secrets and I would get judicial watch on and I would break big news and
[27:41.000 --> 27:47.840]  then they had CNN pieces saying is judicial watch or use Alex Jones on the
[27:47.840 --> 27:52.920]  first times I was on national TV or other groups like world net daily this is
[27:52.920 --> 28:01.080]  like a 98 99 are they racist against Chinese people and again I bring this
[28:01.080 --> 28:06.960]  up not to defend myself from charges of racism it shows how naked this is you
[28:06.960 --> 28:09.840]  don't like Obamacare you're racist you don't want to turn your guns in you're
[28:09.840 --> 28:15.800]  the new Ku Klux Klan and I just keep restating that because it's a fraud
[28:15.800 --> 28:20.160]  folks if you're anti-human you're for Obamacare with the death panels the
[28:20.160 --> 28:23.920]  rationing of care that they have now been caught doing and we told you they
[28:23.920 --> 28:28.720]  were doing years ago at the VA with our whistleblowers they have death list
[28:28.720 --> 28:33.920]  that's a death panel that's what Bill Gates promotes he helped come up with
[28:33.920 --> 28:38.400]  Obamacare with Rahm Emanuel's brother Ezekiel Emanuel who admitted on Fox
[28:38.400 --> 28:45.400]  News the plan is to wreck health care if I said my plan was to wreck a
[28:45.400 --> 28:50.240]  competitor in a company with dirty tricks I could be arrested for organized
[28:50.240 --> 28:55.640]  crime racketeering but when media matters memo comes out three years ago
[28:55.640 --> 29:00.960]  but they're planned to wreck the drudge report and wreck info wars and wreck
[29:00.960 --> 29:05.160]  news core and I'm not defending news core but they're on the list did they
[29:05.160 --> 29:09.480]  get in trouble they said we'll even infiltrate media we don't like from
[29:09.480 --> 29:14.760]  within and destroy it that means they'll get people hired or making stuff up I
[29:14.760 --> 29:19.160]  mean I mean it's like what they did to Tommy Chong they got an informant
[29:19.160 --> 29:25.360]  hired into his bong shop his water pipe shop and then had them mail bongs to the
[29:25.360 --> 29:33.760]  few counties where it's illegal to put him in jail it's a setup folks and it's
[29:33.760 --> 29:37.680]  the same thing but they don't get in trouble and I'm all over the map here

[37:03.880 --> 37:14.520]  authoritarianism and it's so transparent and in truth it doesn't even work on the
[37:14.520 --> 37:18.040]  general public it works on some of the young trendies out there that were
[37:18.040 --> 37:22.840]  brought up in front of television and don't even know how to take care of
[37:22.840 --> 37:26.040]  themselves and it works on some of the dumbed-down people that have owned
[37:26.040 --> 37:30.240]  welfare for three four generations and have no idea what planet they're on and
[37:30.240 --> 37:35.520]  sit around eating MSG and aspartame all day but most people that are actually
[37:35.520 --> 37:40.280]  smart are so self-centered and have decided there's no way to fix it
[37:40.280 --> 37:43.680]  they're just off running their businesses running their lives hoping
[37:43.680 --> 37:49.160]  somebody else fixes it the most common thing I hear from families and airports
[37:49.160 --> 37:53.960]  or walking down the street or at the grocery store or at the mall buying my
[37:53.960 --> 37:58.760]  kids shoes is thank God you're here thank God you're out there I'm glad you're
[37:58.760 --> 38:04.120]  working for us and it'll be special forces people helicopter pilots airline
[38:04.120 --> 38:13.040]  pilots doctors I flew back in from England about a year and a half ago I
[38:13.040 --> 38:19.400]  was being interrogated by the customs lady who knew full well who I was and a
[38:19.400 --> 38:24.920]  airline captain just walks over shaking my hand saying thank God you're there we
[38:24.920 --> 38:29.440]  really appreciate you and that made her mad because the airline pilots said if
[38:29.440 --> 38:32.320]  you don't stop harassing us and grabbing our genitals and searching us
[38:32.320 --> 38:37.120]  we're just not gonna fly you trust us with the aircraft that you know is the
[38:37.120 --> 38:42.680]  equivalent of thousands of pounds of TNT it's a huge flying missile 600 miles an
[38:42.680 --> 38:46.600]  hour we're we're not gonna do this anymore so they hate the fact that
[38:46.600 --> 38:52.920]  they've rebelled and said we're humans treat us as if we're guilty until proven
[38:52.920 --> 38:57.200]  innocent I'm being sarcastic treat us as if we're innocent until proven guilty
[38:57.200 --> 39:03.360]  and so they're left alone and it just deflated her ego smiling at me laughing
[39:03.360 --> 39:07.600]  at me messing with me Macadoo was standing right there she flew back in
[39:07.600 --> 39:16.800]  with me she went to England with me and it was just that human interaction though
[39:16.800 --> 39:21.520]  to show that we had solidarity that ruined it for that bad customs lady that
[39:21.520 --> 39:26.520]  was messing with me and that's why we've got to reach out to each other and
[39:26.520 --> 39:29.680]  meet with each other and promote organizations and everybody who's a
[39:29.680 --> 39:34.880]  patriot should start an access TV show or a news website or a local blog or an
[39:34.880 --> 39:40.320]  audio blog or buy time on local radio it's so inexpensive so you can start
[39:40.320 --> 39:45.000]  having meetings and barbecues and get 10 20 30 a hundred a thousand people
[39:45.000 --> 39:54.920]  together and be a leader in your area because people need to come together but
[39:54.920 --> 40:01.520]  it's a paradox I'm not just demonizing the customs people I flew back in from
[40:01.520 --> 40:07.380]  the Caribbean a month ago and I've told this story and now there's computers in
[40:07.380 --> 40:11.120]  Houston and I was watching everybody else they didn't get a big black X on
[40:11.120 --> 40:16.800]  there's I got a big black X to be searched and everything torn apart and I
[40:16.800 --> 40:21.040]  got up there to the customs guy and he was a listener a retired veteran who
[40:21.040 --> 40:24.600]  went back into federal service after 9-11 because he lost a family member at
[40:24.600 --> 40:27.680]  the World Trade Center towers and he said basically I should listen to you and
[40:27.680 --> 40:31.320]  think you were nuts but now it's all come true and by the way you're not the
[40:31.320 --> 40:35.160]  only one I watched them harass citizens and other people that are obviously on
[40:35.160 --> 40:39.760]  some political list it's these bleeping computers it's it's it's what you said
[40:39.760 --> 40:45.240]  robots taking over this is a load of bull you can go they let the illegals
[40:45.240 --> 40:48.640]  through here all day I'm not allowed to stop them but but but I'm supposed to
[40:48.640 --> 40:53.880]  tear through your stuff or congressman stuff basically a paraphrase but see
[40:53.880 --> 40:58.320]  soon there won't even be a human there it will just be men in black uniforms will
[40:58.320 --> 41:01.680]  run out and drag me away to be interrogated and then the Navy under
[41:01.680 --> 41:10.920]  NDAA oh we're at Alex go oh he was detained permanently
[41:12.920 --> 41:17.480]  of course they won't go after Alex Jones first they'll go after just regular
[41:17.480 --> 41:20.520]  people first and that's what they've been doing and they're setting the
[41:20.520 --> 41:24.760]  precedent to see if they can start disappearing people they've already
[41:24.760 --> 41:28.320]  started admitting their spine on everything we do it's totally illegal
[41:28.320 --> 41:35.520]  they're not getting in trouble so why not start unloosing and unleashing the
[41:35.520 --> 41:40.360]  dogs of tyranny cry havoc and let loose the dogs of war to quote William
[41:40.360 --> 41:50.920]  Shakespeare why not the average FBI the average CIA the average federal person is
[41:50.920 --> 41:56.960]  compartmentalized and is not overtly evil but the compartments that matter
[41:56.960 --> 42:03.240]  are people that like to kill and like to torture and of course that was always
[42:03.240 --> 42:06.680]  going to be turned against us when it was being used on innocent Iraqis and
[42:06.680 --> 42:12.040]  others and I said listen this is going to end up coming home this is going to
[42:12.040 --> 42:16.640]  end up being ubiquitous and now it is they call it pain compliance to break
[42:16.640 --> 42:21.240]  your arms or taser you or strap you down
[42:21.240 --> 42:28.280]  retired staff sergeant Joe Biggs I don't have to believe him he's been an
[42:28.280 --> 42:32.600]  Esquire articles and you name it about it but I know other people in military
[42:32.600 --> 42:36.120]  that have confirmed this and it's came out in congressional testimony but it
[42:36.120 --> 42:42.320]  was industrial level torturing innocent people in Afghanistan Iraq taking them
[42:42.320 --> 42:47.400]  in an assembly line in to be tortured and sometimes the people didn't come out
[42:47.400 --> 42:52.600]  folks keeping people locked up for months inside cages the sizes of their
[42:52.600 --> 43:01.760]  bodies inflicting serious forms of psychological trauma
[43:04.760 --> 43:10.240]  what do they call it when you're scared of closed spaces
[43:10.240 --> 43:17.760]  claustrophobia you know before they take you out and hook electrodes to your
[43:17.760 --> 43:25.440]  genitals and they got away with all that folks you're like well it was against
[43:25.440 --> 43:29.480]  the enemy now it's gonna come home see anything we allow to be done to other
[43:29.480 --> 43:34.320]  people will end up coming back on us that's why George Washington didn't
[43:34.320 --> 43:38.360]  torture people that's why George Washington didn't attack women and
[43:38.360 --> 43:43.560]  children that's why George Washington hung members of his army that did
[43:43.560 --> 43:48.440]  things like that not just because it was justice but because he needed the
[43:48.440 --> 43:56.560]  Psyop of the moral high ground and he knew the British soldiers were his best
[43:56.560 --> 44:02.000]  ally committing atrocities against the colonists and that's what turned the
[44:02.000 --> 44:08.840]  tide was at the atrocities and in our name the atrocities are being committed
[44:08.840 --> 44:13.840]  and publicized all over the world on purpose by the globalist to bring down
[44:13.840 --> 44:17.120]  this country in the final equation they hate us more than they hate other
[44:17.120 --> 44:21.040]  independent nations they hate bitter clingers they hate veterans they've
[44:21.040 --> 44:27.680]  told you they hate you do you think you're just gonna go torture people and
[44:27.680 --> 44:32.280]  then you're gonna come home and the system isn't going to be scared of you
[44:32.280 --> 44:38.720]  the cowards that sends you to do the dirty work and do the hard jobs to
[44:38.720 --> 44:45.600]  traumatize you and to make you serve five six seven eight tours or more you're
[44:45.600 --> 44:49.680]  going to be betrayed you are being betrayed and that's the moral of this
[44:49.680 --> 44:55.520]  story you don't win selling out to the system ladies and gentlemen you lose
[44:55.520 --> 45:04.960]  your honor but just as important even if you don't have honor you end up losing
[45:04.960 --> 45:09.640]  the stability of the nation and the future because when everybody sells out
[45:09.640 --> 45:15.840]  the bottom falls out and there's nowhere to run and there's no real economy
[45:15.840 --> 45:19.800]  anymore everything's based on fraud confidence is lost and everything
[45:19.800 --> 45:25.920]  collapses I don't get up here and criticize the system to discredit things
[45:25.920 --> 45:33.120]  and make things collapse I get up here and expose it so that it can be reformed
[45:33.120 --> 45:41.040]  I've had top professors on and off air and FBI agents and bankers and high level
[45:41.040 --> 45:45.760]  people that don't like the establishment famous NASA engineers famous
[45:45.760 --> 45:50.840]  software engineers people worth hundreds of millions of dollars billions of
[45:50.840 --> 45:55.000]  dollars at dinner parties and things tell me no I know what you're saying is
[45:55.000 --> 46:00.280]  true but what about the argument that as bad as the system is a revolution
[46:00.280 --> 46:03.880]  generally is worse and that you're just discrediting the system and bringing it
[46:03.880 --> 46:09.840]  down faster that's what Agenda 21 and Cloward and Piven and things like that
[46:09.840 --> 46:16.480]  are is the philosophy of the controlled collapse to bring down the old system
[46:16.480 --> 46:21.240]  because despite the fact that it has problems it isn't one-tenth as evil as
[46:21.240 --> 46:27.480]  what the globalists want so I'm trying to reform the Republic I'm trying to
[46:27.480 --> 46:32.360]  restore the Republic I'm a counter-revolutionary I believe most of
[46:32.360 --> 46:36.120]  you are if you really look in the mirror but at the same time the globalists
[46:36.120 --> 46:39.720]  have already taken over so much and already overthrown the old Republic is
[46:39.720 --> 46:44.760]  such an extent that that I am a revolutionary because I'm a revolutionary
[46:44.760 --> 46:48.240]  against those that think they're the rightful controllers and have a right
[46:48.240 --> 46:53.640]  to be tyrants so I have a leg in both camps here I'm trying to fix things
[46:53.640 --> 46:57.960]  peacefully I'm trying to talk to the establishment sectors of it that aren't
[46:57.960 --> 47:05.160]  criminally insane and who don't have a lust to bring down society they just
[47:05.160 --> 47:09.280]  want to control things and be rich and powerful and have stability and they've
[47:09.280 --> 47:13.720]  done a lot of bad things to maintain that but do they really want to bring in
[47:13.720 --> 47:18.240]  a communist revolution do they really want to bring it all crashing down
[47:18.240 --> 47:25.000]  knowing how hellish it'll be do we really want to slit America's throat the
[47:25.000 --> 47:30.360]  obvious answer is no but if the globalist camp that wants radical
[47:30.360 --> 47:37.000]  revolution the George Soros crowd who wants to really conquer this country if
[47:37.000 --> 47:43.800]  they win and start a civil war between the police and the citizens between the
[47:43.800 --> 47:52.120]  paramilitary and the citizens it's the only way they have a shot at winning and
[47:52.120 --> 47:59.600]  it is going to be hell on earth and we're already seeing the destabilization
[47:59.600 --> 48:03.600]  campaign we're already seeing the mass build up it's very clear they have their
[48:03.600 --> 48:09.440]  finger on the trigger to false flag blame the liberty movement rollout race war
[48:09.440 --> 48:14.400]  in the southwest have regular army come in as the cover to maintain order and
[48:14.400 --> 48:21.600]  then after people accepted martial law or they'll call it civil emergency start
[48:21.600 --> 48:31.360]  the political roundups of both left and right in the name of stability and then
[48:31.360 --> 48:34.920]  it will shift into a pure roundup of libertarians in the next phase now
[48:34.920 --> 48:39.440]  that's their main plan I've reverse engineered it and you better listen to
[48:39.440 --> 48:45.800]  me folks because in this civil war and the rand corporations done some numbers
[48:45.800 --> 48:52.280]  on this as well years ago but in a civil war in this country it's estimated that
[48:52.280 --> 48:58.240]  several million will die and I would not want to be in the US military or a
[48:58.240 --> 49:03.560]  police officer if this kicks off and I take no pleasure shaying that you were
[49:03.560 --> 49:09.360]  to be decimated that's not my plan that's the globalist plan and you will
[49:09.360 --> 49:15.640]  be decimated probably five-fold decimated only means 10% comes from
[49:15.640 --> 49:18.280]  one of a unit did something wrong the Romans would kill a certain percentage
[49:18.280 --> 49:23.000]  of people in the unit as punishment to all I mean I'd say you might get half
[49:23.000 --> 49:27.240]  the cops killed or wounded I mean it's it's unbelievable and then of course the
[49:27.240 --> 49:32.400]  globalist will sit back watching you in phase one being wiped out by the gun
[49:32.400 --> 49:42.000]  owners and the gun owners being wiped out and all hell breaking loose and I'm
[49:42.000 --> 49:46.880]  just so frustrated by all this unfolding I mean you look at the stack of news
[49:46.880 --> 49:50.080]  all what's happening with the border it's totally transparent now it's
[49:50.080 --> 50:00.080]  premeditated it's accelerating and nothing's being done Ebola is now
[50:00.080 --> 50:05.080]  becoming a global pandemic outbreak danger we're gonna get into that
[50:05.080 --> 50:13.160]  Liberia warns of global Ebola pandemic CBS News the dollar is being devalued
[50:13.160 --> 50:16.800]  and accelerated rate the West is funding the overthrow of stable governments
[50:16.800 --> 50:22.760]  everywhere the military is being prepared for war the American people
[50:22.760 --> 50:28.480]  publicly been going on quietly for a long time now it's public the neo cons
[50:28.480 --> 50:32.320]  are running around saying you're a KGB agent if you don't support nuclear war
[50:32.320 --> 50:39.640]  with Russia and they're preparing a new financial meltdown and more banker
[50:39.640 --> 50:46.080]  bailouts I mean we need to turn back now we need to just stop now that this this
[50:46.080 --> 50:50.040]  needs to stop we need to get off this ride right now I'll give the latest on

[01:00:45.560 --> 01:00:54.240]  ladies and gentlemen here's the headline at info wars calm quoting a top
[01:00:54.240 --> 01:01:00.440]  German daily why we will go to war with Russia the latest headline to appear in

[01:01:08.800 --> 01:01:13.480]  kind of news I have here in the old stack Liberia warns of global Ebola
[01:01:13.480 --> 01:01:19.640]  pandemic more than 700 people have died in four Western African nations they
[01:01:19.640 --> 01:01:30.360]  believe 30,000 may be infected that's CVS news here's another one is it Ebola or
[01:01:30.360 --> 01:01:34.320]  is it psychological warfare we'll talk to John Rappaport coming up in the next
[01:01:34.320 --> 01:01:39.240]  segment about that Obama administration spent thousands on strippers
[01:01:39.240 --> 01:01:44.000]  boxing tickets and failed sting on Border Patrol agent that that's the kind
[01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:48.600]  of thing the government does is mess with its own people all day and try to
[01:01:48.600 --> 01:01:52.040]  blackmail the Secret Service over somebody getting a hooker while the
[01:01:52.040 --> 01:01:57.360]  government funds ISIS to kill 300,000 people in the Middle East mainly
[01:01:57.360 --> 01:02:05.080]  Christians and conservatives are mum on it that's the type of news we have on
[01:02:05.080 --> 01:02:12.640]  that front dealing with all of the Ebola news
[01:02:13.520 --> 01:02:20.800]  we're also going to be getting into a woman who sued after becoming unwitting
[01:02:20.800 --> 01:02:25.480]  hostage in unannounced active shooter drill we've interviewed a lot of school
[01:02:25.480 --> 01:02:29.800]  teachers over the years that have sued and won lawsuits from Texas to Minnesota
[01:02:29.800 --> 01:02:35.360]  and in two of the cases I remember because unannounced they people show up
[01:02:35.360 --> 01:02:39.320]  as robbers and come in the portable building in one case or come in the
[01:02:39.320 --> 01:02:44.480]  school and say I'm going to blow your head off and the elementary students in
[01:02:44.480 --> 01:02:49.440]  both cases began crapping themselves literally and peeing on themselves I'm
[01:02:49.440 --> 01:02:52.640]  not trying to be dramatic here that was in the lawsuits that came out in the
[01:02:52.640 --> 01:02:57.440]  news in both cases because it's like it's real we're talking six seven eight
[01:02:57.440 --> 01:03:01.640]  year olds with with guys saying I'm gonna kill you we're gonna execute you
[01:03:01.640 --> 01:03:04.680]  and taking them out in the woods in one case the woman won a lawsuit in that
[01:03:04.680 --> 01:03:11.560]  Minnesota this has been going on forever it's trauma-based mind control I've got
[01:03:11.560 --> 01:03:15.440]  it in police state three total enslavement clips of newscasts from
[01:03:15.440 --> 01:03:21.160]  Washington State to New York State showing children elementary children
[01:03:21.160 --> 01:03:28.120]  crying scared as men point guns at them unannounced that's what a reeducation
[01:03:28.120 --> 01:03:37.080]  campus with adults in an MK ultra mind control camp like Camp X-ray and Gitmo
[01:03:37.080 --> 01:03:41.440]  where they actually create double agents breaking them they put them on PCP or LSD
[01:03:41.440 --> 01:03:47.400]  or both or peyote and then dress up in devil outfits and have women come in and
[01:03:47.400 --> 01:03:52.720]  rape them and then throw buckets of pig blood on them that actually came out
[01:03:52.720 --> 01:03:57.880]  about six seven years ago in lawsuits and it was confirmed that they rape the
[01:03:57.880 --> 01:04:04.280]  Muslim men while they're on drugs with high-dollar prostitutes flown in in
[01:04:04.280 --> 01:04:09.840]  devil outfits wearing devil debt you ugly devil mask and I'm not trying to
[01:04:09.840 --> 01:04:15.400]  just put that I was a sensational folks it is sensational now you don't need with
[01:04:15.400 --> 01:04:19.040]  a seven-year-old to rape them and put a devil mask on if you of course the truth
[01:04:19.040 --> 01:04:23.640]  is the CIA is doing that at the laboratory at Camp X-ray because they
[01:04:23.640 --> 01:04:28.640]  like it but they they're not doing that just for mind control they like having
[01:04:28.640 --> 01:04:34.080]  sex with the prostitutes and the buckets of blood as well so I'm not kidding and
[01:04:34.080 --> 01:04:36.480]  you know what you might send me see why don't you attack me for that and then
[01:04:36.480 --> 01:04:39.720]  you people will go look it up and find out it's true was in mainstream news five

[01:11:03.760 --> 01:11:07.920]  Middle Eastern countries in Europe lock their borders down while Haroldo
[01:11:07.920 --> 01:11:13.720]  Rivera says Matt drudge is a basically a racist race baiter and Oberman says I
[01:11:13.720 --> 01:11:18.360]  am and infor wars is bad yesterday because we're saying diseases might come
[01:11:18.360 --> 01:11:26.920]  across like drug-resistant TB and MRSA it is what do you think goes on in Latin
[01:11:26.920 --> 01:11:31.520]  America it's a fact Jack two-thirds the people at Ellis Island were turned back
[01:11:31.520 --> 01:11:36.120]  from Italy and Ireland and everywhere else because if you had TB you didn't
[01:11:36.120 --> 01:11:43.080]  get let in now you do Obama weighs fewer deportations of illegal immigrants
[01:11:43.080 --> 01:11:46.080]  living in the US Wall Street Journal telling us something we already knew
[01:11:46.080 --> 01:11:51.120]  down by over 90% movement towards broad steps including work permits follows
[01:11:51.120 --> 01:11:57.320]  demise of legislation that's called dictatorship operating by fiat outside of
[01:11:57.320 --> 01:12:04.440]  law outside the courts just saying I'll issue five million worker visas a month
[01:12:04.440 --> 01:12:08.640]  that's why they say over three years it'll be the entire population of El
[01:12:08.640 --> 01:12:13.560]  Salvador Nicaragua and Guatemala that's what they've put in the bill and
[01:12:13.560 --> 01:12:17.800]  they're doing what they can't get in the bill by fiat just like he shut the
[01:12:17.800 --> 01:12:22.240]  power plants down even though there's no bill that got passed three years ago the
[01:12:22.240 --> 01:12:28.480]  carbon tax it's on like Donkey Kong ladies and gentlemen that's a silly
[01:12:28.480 --> 01:12:31.560]  statement from the 80s I don't really know what it means but it's kind of
[01:12:31.560 --> 01:12:36.680]  goofy so I used it I mean this is crazy here's another one representative
[01:12:36.680 --> 01:12:41.520]  Gutierrez Obama is going to act broadly and generously for millions upon
[01:12:41.520 --> 01:12:45.720]  millions of illegals he said that on MSNBC there's video of it I mean
[01:12:45.720 --> 01:12:50.360]  unbelievable Geraldo unloads on Matt Drudge over border coverage doing his
[01:12:50.360 --> 01:12:54.960]  best to stir up civil war no the globalists are causing a civil war
[01:12:54.960 --> 01:13:01.480]  doing this it's their plan and the talking points have gone out oberman or
[01:13:01.480 --> 01:13:06.840]  Geraldo all of them are attacking not just drudge but myself and others because
[01:13:06.840 --> 01:13:10.840]  the system knows who knows what's going on
[01:13:11.560 --> 01:13:14.160]  Rolter of era Matt drudge creating worse
[01:13:14.160 --> 01:13:20.160]  jingoistic rhetoric ever this is happening this is cut and dry the end of
[01:13:20.160 --> 01:13:25.280]  the country if they win okay and and Geraldo is just going with with race you
[01:13:25.280 --> 01:13:30.840]  know Hitler did that it's easy to go with race but see only white people can
[01:13:30.840 --> 01:13:36.240]  be bad basing things on some type of ethnic connection I mean does it say if
[01:13:36.240 --> 01:13:39.720]  you're from Latin America you get free everything and get to violate all the
[01:13:39.720 --> 01:13:43.240]  laws but but veterans don't get health care if you're a Hispanic veteran I mean
[01:13:43.240 --> 01:13:49.840]  it's bull the illegals Fox's reporting are being shipped by the tens of
[01:13:49.840 --> 01:13:55.120]  thousands per week to a very nice digs in Hawaii I've never gotten to go to
[01:13:55.120 --> 01:14:02.280]  Hawaii yet me either me yeah me either but because you're racist well I'm a
[01:14:02.280 --> 01:14:04.840]  US citizen can I well it doesn't matter if you're not really like a friend

[01:14:08.640 --> 01:14:14.320]  forgot shut up I'm racist too I need to shut up big sarcastic John what do you
[01:14:14.320 --> 01:14:21.480]  think about this it's it's escalating it is escalating you know when I'm not
[01:14:21.480 --> 01:14:25.920]  even here I'm thinking about it because it's in my life oh yeah I mean I'm
[01:14:25.920 --> 01:14:28.880]  freaked out I mean I've always been a little concerned but thought we could
[01:14:28.880 --> 01:14:31.640]  try to turn this around I mean this is just the thing is it's gonna get a lot
[01:14:31.640 --> 01:14:36.280]  worse it's blatant at this point exactly that's how criminology works when it's
[01:14:36.280 --> 01:14:40.840]  this blatant oh my gosh I mean criminals are just gonna go nuts now at every
[01:14:40.840 --> 01:14:45.400]  level and then good people are gonna start following at a Freudian slip good
[01:14:45.400 --> 01:14:49.400]  people are gonna stop following the laws and then everything's gonna collapse
[01:14:49.400 --> 01:14:54.760]  which is the plan then they'll bring martial law in immigrant teen claims he
[01:14:54.760 --> 01:15:01.560]  was mistreated by border officials and put in a cold cell oh my gosh which again
[01:15:01.560 --> 01:15:05.640]  they knock your teeth out in Mexico why is it only bad when something happens
[01:15:05.640 --> 01:15:10.520]  here shock 80% of US population growth is from immigrants resources being
[01:15:10.520 --> 01:15:15.440]  sucked dry Washington examiner breaks it down voter ID law upheld in Wisconsin
[01:15:15.440 --> 01:15:18.880]  Supreme Court for identification as a condition of our times because the
[01:15:18.880 --> 01:15:23.480]  Democrats are on record with their blue state initiative saying they're gonna
[01:15:23.480 --> 01:15:26.360]  give the illegals driver's license to vote and they've been caught everywhere
[01:15:26.360 --> 01:15:31.400]  doing it that's what's happening game over I can handle given the illegals
[01:15:31.400 --> 01:15:36.000]  welfare that's bad enough but at least they spend the money in the economy it's
[01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:39.160]  not some banker bailout so it's not the worst former welfare if you look at the
[01:15:39.160 --> 01:15:48.560]  economics but the issue is they're voting 9 to 1 to take my guns and to
[01:15:48.560 --> 01:15:53.520]  follow a socialist authoritarian plan that's exactly what all the patriots
[01:15:53.520 --> 01:15:56.560]  warned of that if we ever became socialists we would become communist
[01:15:56.560 --> 01:16:01.080]  because the other group can vote all your money away to them it's legalized
[01:16:01.080 --> 01:16:06.320]  theft ladies and gentlemen with the government trying to organize Hispanics
[01:16:06.320 --> 01:16:13.480]  into basically Hispanic Ku Klux Klan groups if a la Raza down with gringos

[01:17:11.280 --> 01:17:19.040]  only place in the US worse than Honduras Nicaragua El Salvador or Guatemala
[01:17:19.040 --> 01:17:26.480]  the only place they can go worse out of the fire into the frying pan as they
[01:17:26.480 --> 01:17:32.760]  say Rahman annual wants to bring this country down he says the city of big

[01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:11.640]  of it 800 25 992 31 800 25 992 31 first-time callers again folks John we're
[01:18:11.640 --> 01:18:13.880]  going to break here in a few minutes I appreciate you coming on a short notice
[01:18:13.880 --> 01:18:20.120]  your article from no more fake news calm is up on info wars calm is it obola or
[01:18:20.120 --> 01:18:27.120]  is it psychological warfare was the question that you pose compadre and so
[01:18:27.120 --> 01:18:30.280]  I wanted to get your take give us your preface first we'll come back into
[01:18:30.280 --> 01:18:42.200]  tail it okay Alex basically we've got about 800 cases 500 confirmed deaths
[01:18:42.200 --> 01:18:46.680]  supposedly from Ebola the same organization that's generating those
[01:18:46.680 --> 01:18:53.600]  statistics the World Health Organization will tell you that every year in the
[01:18:53.600 --> 01:18:59.960]  world between 3 and 5 million people die from regular seasonal flu I mean
[01:18:59.960 --> 01:19:06.320]  cases of regular seasonal flu and between 250 thousand and 500 thousand
[01:19:06.320 --> 01:19:11.400]  deaths every year from regular old ordinary flu that's not one time that's
[01:19:11.400 --> 01:19:15.640]  every single year so they call that an epidemic a pandemic and outbreak
[01:19:15.640 --> 01:19:19.080]  anything no they don't call it anything the press doesn't say anything nothing
[01:19:19.080 --> 01:19:26.160]  happens and yet when they're reporting 800 cases 500 deaths all of a sudden it's
[01:19:26.160 --> 01:19:33.400]  going to destroy the whole world is it a psychological operation you bet well I
[01:19:33.400 --> 01:19:38.200]  tend to agree with you but usually they hype it up when there's 10 deaths 500
[01:19:38.200 --> 01:19:42.040]  deaths 800 cases they're now saying there could be as many as 30,000 people
[01:19:42.040 --> 01:19:47.120]  that have been exposed or infected that's in British papers but I agree
[01:19:47.120 --> 01:19:53.120]  overall as a Psyop look to it because I know for a fact that Ebola these monkey
[01:19:53.120 --> 01:19:57.760]  viruses were basically toyed with in labs in the 60s that's been confirmed
[01:19:57.760 --> 01:20:02.200]  that there's links to bio weapons question could too many GMO foods and

[01:24:33.840 --> 01:24:37.560]  articles in it a lot of times than I see in what you'd call mainstream British
[01:24:37.560 --> 01:24:44.240]  news but Nigeria's special advisor on public health Dr. Yahweedy Addish
[01:24:44.240 --> 01:24:50.080]  Shania said we're actually looking at contacting over 30,000 people that
[01:24:50.080 --> 01:24:53.560]  potentially could have been exposed or gotten it now is that hype to get more
[01:24:53.560 --> 01:24:58.880]  funding to the country or should we be really concerned because Germany's
[01:24:58.880 --> 01:25:02.960]  reportedly taking patients into the country I think that's very reckless and
[01:25:02.960 --> 01:25:09.240]  then there's the background reason I'm concerned John is that there is a history
[01:25:09.240 --> 01:25:14.320]  of this being connected to bio weapons research it's not conclusive like polio
[01:25:14.320 --> 01:25:19.120]  or conclusive like HIV but the studies were there just like the CIA studied
[01:25:19.120 --> 01:25:26.920]  weaponized cancer okay so let's listen in a UK this is what it's really all
[01:25:26.920 --> 01:25:31.840]  about the Cobra group which is this elite sort of cabinet group met because
[01:25:31.840 --> 01:25:38.400]  one guy that is claiming to have died from Ebola named Patrick Sawyer flew to a
[01:25:38.400 --> 01:25:45.240]  few airports okay so now they're saying all of a sudden well he might have been
[01:25:45.240 --> 01:25:50.280]  in contact with people who were in contact with people etc etc up to 30,000
[01:25:50.280 --> 01:25:55.320]  now we have to actually try to track down 30,000 people and see what's
[01:25:55.320 --> 01:26:00.120]  happening with them this is all fear-mongering scare tactics shut down
[01:26:00.120 --> 01:26:06.440]  the country restrict travel impose martial law emergency is all of this
[01:26:06.440 --> 01:26:10.720]  kind of thing because as I said in the last segment if you look at the World
[01:26:10.720 --> 01:26:17.720]  Health Organization stats on deaths from regular ordinary flu every year in the
[01:26:17.720 --> 01:26:26.200]  world it's between 250,000 and five contact all their contacts you want to
[01:26:26.200 --> 01:26:30.200]  contact maybe I don't know 500 million people around the world because they
[01:26:30.200 --> 01:26:34.240]  might have come in contact with somebody who died from a regular flu this
[01:26:34.240 --> 01:26:40.120]  whole thing is upside down and inside out and we've seen this before or was
[01:26:40.120 --> 01:26:46.200]  swine flu which was a dud West Nile which was a dud bird flu which was a
[01:26:46.200 --> 01:26:51.480]  dud SARS which was a dud they were all promoted as this is it folks this is a
[01:26:51.480 --> 01:26:55.600]  one this is going to kill everybody and then all of a sudden the petered out and
[01:26:55.600 --> 01:27:01.400]  in fact the Centers for Disease Control in the summer of 2009 stopped
[01:27:01.400 --> 01:27:05.920]  counting swine flu cases in America because they knew that most of the
[01:27:05.920 --> 01:27:10.000]  people who were getting tested in hospitals didn't have any kind of flu
[01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:15.360]  whatsoever and this story was exposed by CBS News is Cheryl Atkinson you want to
[01:27:15.360 --> 01:27:19.600]  know one of the reasons she was really fired because she exposed this huge con
[01:27:19.600 --> 01:27:28.320]  by the CDC and they shut her down for it and the CDC went up all down and say we
[01:27:28.320 --> 01:27:31.720]  think there's probably 10 million cases of swine flu in America which was
[01:27:31.720 --> 01:27:36.400]  completely insane no basis in fact whatsoever so until we see some more
[01:27:36.400 --> 01:27:43.320]  information on this to say that supposedly 800 cases in the world of Ebola
[01:27:43.320 --> 01:27:47.240]  and four to 500 deaths is going to you know destroy the world or we should
[01:27:47.240 --> 01:27:52.160]  declare the pandemic you have to look at these other factors here and people
[01:27:52.160 --> 01:27:57.480]  aren't doing it so I see a tremendous amount of fear mongering here well I
[01:27:57.480 --> 01:28:00.640]  agree with you and certainly they were caught red-handed even the European
[01:28:00.640 --> 01:28:04.920]  Commission admitted it hyping a swine flu it was really a flu-simulant
[01:28:04.920 --> 01:28:09.040]  synthetic virus they designed that actually weakened your immune system
[01:28:09.040 --> 01:28:14.520]  50% to the real flu even medical doctors admit 30,000 people don't die in the
[01:28:14.520 --> 01:28:18.640]  US a year from flu people that have kidney failure organ failure that are
[01:28:18.640 --> 01:28:24.720]  85 years old or two years old who have HIV who are already compromised then die
[01:28:24.720 --> 01:28:30.960]  in the hospital and they just call it flu or when some airborne bacteria kills
[01:28:30.960 --> 01:28:36.040]  you in the in the hospital they just call it flu the truth is flu is a giant
[01:28:36.040 --> 01:28:39.960]  hype so I so I see the parallel and I sure hope you're right about this
[01:28:39.960 --> 01:28:44.280]  Ebola situation I just know people like dr. Pionka who's a top globalist
[01:28:44.280 --> 01:28:48.760]  involved in the eugenics movement he you know he licks his lips and says soon
[01:28:48.760 --> 01:28:53.240]  the airborne Ebola will be released and so there are a lot of creepy insiders
[01:28:53.240 --> 01:29:00.200]  licking their lips concerning Ebola yeah no question about it and you're
[01:29:00.200 --> 01:29:03.520]  absolutely right about the flu you see one thing that most people don't
[01:29:03.520 --> 01:29:11.000]  understand is you got to make a test a diagnostic test to really diagnose it
[01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:17.080]  anybody with anything and these guys can be faked they can be slanted some of
[01:29:17.080 --> 01:29:20.560]  them are inherently unreliable
[01:29:20.560 --> 01:29:24.760]  alright John well even though our Skype connection to use breaking up you've

[01:34:34.160 --> 01:34:39.520]  extremist if you go wow he's gonna sign executive orders to ban the
[01:34:39.520 --> 01:34:44.760]  manufacture of high capacity mags he's saying and to make all new guns have
[01:34:44.760 --> 01:34:48.400]  biometrics on them and then sign order letter to ban previously made guns
[01:34:48.400 --> 01:34:53.440]  wow California did micro stamping bankrupting the gun industry there
[01:34:53.440 --> 01:35:00.320]  everywhere they're in control Chicago New York DC they totally ban guns they're

[01:35:08.080 --> 01:35:15.400]  executive action that's illegal and Boehner says we can't impeach cuz boy
[01:35:15.400 --> 01:35:20.320]  Obama's making the Democrats uncomfortable and he's gonna make the
[01:35:20.320 --> 01:35:25.280]  Democrats lose seats well who needs Republicans when they're like John Boehner
[01:35:25.280 --> 01:35:32.960]  for Obamacare for the banker bailout been for amnesty in the past he's
[01:35:32.960 --> 01:35:41.600]  basically Barack Obama but I think he plays more golf I mean is that the only
[01:35:41.600 --> 01:35:52.280]  difference they both smoke cigarettes they both fake cry I think John Boehner
[01:35:52.280 --> 01:36:01.600]  maybe a worse trader than Obama and you got Pat Buchanan who I respect saying oh
[01:36:01.600 --> 01:36:06.880]  yeah don't impeach it's a bridge too far it'll make Obama a victim no it won't
[01:36:06.880 --> 01:36:12.400]  it won't make him a martyr politically we need to go after all these people not
[01:36:12.400 --> 01:36:17.240]  just Democrats when you go after Republicans we need to punish them we
[01:36:17.240 --> 01:36:21.880]  need to turn this around the political class has gone crazy just because they
[01:36:21.880 --> 01:36:26.080]  have the false authority and the power doesn't mean they're gonna make
[01:36:26.080 --> 01:36:29.840]  decisions that don't destroy everything see a lot of people out there in the
[01:36:29.840 --> 01:36:33.400]  establishment think that the dictatorial group is gonna manage things and
[01:36:33.400 --> 01:36:38.840]  they know how to take care of stuff and he'll turn out okay no it's not okay it's
[01:36:38.840 --> 01:36:42.280]  reached crazy town level
[01:36:47.840 --> 01:36:54.520]  and now CNBC is reporting a summer sell-off Dow has just dropped 200 points
[01:36:54.520 --> 01:37:00.120]  stocks negative for July that happens a lot though at the end of July and
[01:37:00.120 --> 01:37:06.160]  August US stocks declined today with benchmark indexes on track for their
[01:37:06.160 --> 01:37:10.720]  first monthly loss since January as investors worried about Europe's
[01:37:10.720 --> 01:37:15.040]  economy and a jump in US labor costs further the idea that the Federal
[01:37:15.040 --> 01:37:19.960]  Reserve would have to hike interest rates sooner rather than later Europe is
[01:37:19.960 --> 01:37:23.640]  struggling to keep its head above watered economically and for the first
[01:37:23.640 --> 01:37:28.200]  time there is the possibility the Fed may have to shift from offense to defense
[01:37:28.200 --> 01:37:35.160]  said Bruce Bittles chief investment strategist at RW Barrett and Co investor
[01:37:35.160 --> 01:37:39.560]  sentiment was also hit by Argentina's default after hopes for a deal with a
[01:37:39.560 --> 01:37:44.360]  holdout cutters fell through Argentine stocks traded in US were hit
[01:37:44.360 --> 01:37:51.120]  including Pampa Energy yeah what they're doing is milking the Argentinians
[01:37:51.120 --> 01:37:54.560]  again who used to be richer than us a hundred years ago the richest country in
[01:37:54.560 --> 01:38:01.560]  this hemisphere not anymore they've wrecked that country they're gonna wreck
[01:38:01.560 --> 01:38:07.680]  us as well you know I think it'll bounce back up before it finally dives down
[01:38:07.680 --> 01:38:14.960]  maybe 5,000 10,000 points who knows a lot of analysts say 10,000 points but
[01:38:14.960 --> 01:38:19.680]  maybe that won't happen because they've pumped so many tens upon tens upon tens
[01:38:19.680 --> 01:38:25.320]  of trillions of Federal Reserve QE unlimited into the stock market with
[01:38:25.320 --> 01:38:29.920]  the president's open markets committee and the plunge protection team as it's
[01:38:29.920 --> 01:38:35.040]  properly known that that's why it's ballooning that's the biggest reason is
[01:38:35.040 --> 01:38:44.320]  that it's devalued dollars in China they buy US treasuries gold and build
[01:38:44.320 --> 01:38:48.840]  apartment buildings for tens of millions of people that are empty because
[01:38:48.840 --> 01:38:52.720]  they won't let the poor people move in they get to live in boxes and shacks and
[01:38:52.720 --> 01:38:59.920]  chain their kids up in light poles and then they go in and work on the slave
[01:38:59.920 --> 01:39:05.560]  factories but if you're nine or ten year old walks across the street to play at
[01:39:05.560 --> 01:39:11.080]  the park or go swimming at the community pool they ask where's your mama and
[01:39:11.080 --> 01:39:14.880]  when they say mama's across the street or mama's at work the police come and
[01:39:14.880 --> 01:39:20.440]  arrest mama and they take you to the CPS because they define it as abuse
[01:39:20.440 --> 01:39:26.480]  there's no law they just say it's abusive I would go to the community pool
[01:39:26.480 --> 01:39:32.120]  granted it was a country club golf course community I grew up in but it's the
[01:39:32.120 --> 01:39:35.280]  same thing as going to a city pool across the street like my mom would do
[01:39:35.280 --> 01:39:38.840]  when she was six years old she lived right across the street in Hyde Park
[01:39:38.840 --> 01:39:44.000]  Austin from the pool I've been there and swimming the pool and they're in seeing
[01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:48.440]  the house you grew up in ought to buy that house anyways the whole point is
[01:39:48.440 --> 01:39:52.520]  neat old house that'd be cool make an office out of it or something anyways
[01:39:52.520 --> 01:40:01.960]  the whole point is is that my mother by the time I was about seven years old in
[01:40:01.960 --> 01:40:08.640]  the summer they would show Godzilla and King Kong movies almost every day after
[01:40:08.640 --> 01:40:12.640]  soap operas at like three o'clock and then she'd make me lunch and my friends
[01:40:12.640 --> 01:40:16.080]  would come over and we built forts in the backyard and play in the old woods
[01:40:16.080 --> 01:40:19.240]  with a railroad track as we live in the golf course but by the back of it so
[01:40:19.240 --> 01:40:22.480]  that there was like farms and ranches behind us and on the edge of Dallas
[01:40:22.480 --> 01:40:30.120]  anyways I'm thinking about days long past and I remember running down the hill
[01:40:30.120 --> 01:40:38.240]  and I would just run the half mile down the big grassy hill across the golf
[01:40:38.240 --> 01:40:43.720]  courses across the night hole and then cut across down over by the over by the
[01:40:43.720 --> 01:40:52.440]  fifth hole and then I would run up the hill and I would come in to the country
[01:40:52.440 --> 01:40:57.760]  club pool and I'd show him my little tag and then we swim in the morning and we
[01:40:57.760 --> 01:41:01.600]  go and watch Godzilla and we go back and swim in the evening and my mother
[01:41:01.600 --> 01:41:06.680]  wasn't arrested when I was six seven eight years old and nobody got in
[01:41:06.680 --> 01:41:10.880]  trouble now granted it was a gated country club but it wasn't that fancy
[01:41:10.880 --> 01:41:15.000]  it was nice but they're like a five bedroom house I guess it was pretty
[01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:21.600]  darn nice the point is you know people that know that live in three bedroom
[01:41:21.600 --> 01:41:25.960]  houses if their kids go across the street to the community pool or their
[01:41:25.960 --> 01:41:30.440]  kids go play in the park even if mommy's watching them out the window you go
[01:41:30.440 --> 01:41:34.880]  to jail and if you get caught playing with an earth gun in your backyard the
[01:41:34.880 --> 01:41:38.880]  neighbor sees it you get thrown out of school there's no law that you can't
[01:41:38.880 --> 01:41:42.280]  have a nerf gun in your backyard playing with it when the neighbor calls and
[01:41:42.280 --> 01:41:46.160]  rats you out look that up boys suspended for playing with nerf gun in
[01:41:46.160 --> 01:41:50.160]  backyard no one says there's no jurisdiction there no one says how do
[01:41:50.160 --> 01:41:54.320]  they claim a policy of what you do outside school kicks you out everyone
[01:41:54.320 --> 01:42:00.080]  acquiesces everyone bows down and so the precedent is set just like we learned
[01:42:00.080 --> 01:42:07.480]  six years ago during a fake h1n1 crisis that I'm going to your calls just like
[01:42:07.480 --> 01:42:21.760]  we learned then makes my head spin that in Alabama and California and Wisconsin
[01:42:21.760 --> 01:42:25.960]  and other states you can look this up they were lining the kids up giving them
[01:42:25.960 --> 01:42:30.280]  h1n1 shots without parental consent they were sending letters home for weeks
[01:42:30.280 --> 01:42:37.640]  saying we're gonna have shot day it's free like a hole in the head and when
[01:42:37.640 --> 01:42:43.360]  the parents expressly said no they lined the first graders up notice who they
[01:42:43.360 --> 01:42:46.040]  think can't talk to mommy and daddy they've already had so much mercury in
[01:42:46.040 --> 01:42:49.880]  them most of them can't even talk by age five soon it'll be a conspiracy that
[01:42:49.880 --> 01:42:53.080]  people can ever talk or have kids or it'll be a conspiracy that women ever
[01:42:53.080 --> 01:42:56.800]  breastfed I'm telling you you think I'm joking they'll be 20 years from now
[01:42:56.800 --> 01:42:59.920]  they'll be locking you up if you ever claimed there was such a thing as a
[01:42:59.920 --> 01:43:10.680]  family everybody knows that's racist they want to lock us up put us in the
[01:43:10.680 --> 01:43:17.320]  pretty pins I don't want to be in your prison planet I don't want to be in your
[01:43:17.320 --> 01:43:25.360]  new world order stop right there butchering the misfits it makes my
[01:43:25.360 --> 01:43:29.680]  head spin and people just put up with it there are more articles out today of
[01:43:29.680 --> 01:43:33.160]  people being arrested for their children playing across the street at parks or
[01:43:33.160 --> 01:43:38.640]  letting you know nine-year-olds go to the city pool everyone listening every
[01:43:38.640 --> 01:43:46.440]  cop listening who's over 30 years old listening to me guaranteed went to the
[01:43:46.440 --> 01:43:52.240]  pool when they were seven eight years old and did not have mommy with them my
[01:43:52.240 --> 01:43:56.040]  parents used to be going to meetings in Austin to see family or whatever and I
[01:43:56.040 --> 01:44:00.400]  if I didn't want to go when my dad was down here on business they would drop me
[01:44:00.400 --> 01:44:05.920]  off at Barton Springs give me $10 and say eat a hamburger and fries at the
[01:44:05.920 --> 01:44:10.480]  snack shack we're picking you up in four hours here's your mask and snorkel
[01:44:10.480 --> 01:44:16.880]  when I was 10 years old jail time now jail time baby because we're such a free
[01:44:16.880 --> 01:44:23.080]  country but where am I going with all this you can put your child on a train
[01:44:23.080 --> 01:44:29.560]  or a plane from Guatemala in Central America or Brazil in South America and
[01:44:29.560 --> 01:44:35.560]  they will direct the aircraft to land at military bases in El Paso and other
[01:44:35.560 --> 01:44:40.400]  areas and your children this is all set up like a thousand are coming up from
[01:44:40.400 --> 01:44:45.080]  Honduras that Chicago organized they're gonna fly into bases run by Obama
[01:44:45.080 --> 01:44:49.280]  because he's a dictator and they're gonna go to Chicago and get everything
[01:44:49.280 --> 01:44:53.520]  free and be warred to the state for the rest their lives and they're just the
[01:44:53.520 --> 01:44:59.280]  bait to bring in more that's why this is all publicized so you can put your kid
[01:44:59.280 --> 01:45:03.560]  on an airplane and fly them into a military base or put them on a bus and
[01:45:03.560 --> 01:45:09.440]  they get up there and just say my name is Pepe Escobar your name could be
[01:45:09.440 --> 01:45:12.960]  hobby pock mid I don't know
[01:45:13.640 --> 01:45:17.720]  your name could be Donald Schmidt doesn't matter you can make up whatever

[01:45:22.200 --> 01:45:26.960]  and then lo and behold none of the kids in Dallas last week showed up for their
[01:45:26.960 --> 01:45:30.860]  deportation hearings at the hearings they were gonna let them stay for five
[01:45:30.860 --> 01:45:33.920]  years it's been announced three to five years but no they didn't even show up for
[01:45:33.920 --> 01:45:42.280]  that it's all a giant joke if you're a Hispanic fifth generation American and
[01:45:42.280 --> 01:45:46.240]  you serve in the military and you have no criminal record and your nine year old
[01:45:46.240 --> 01:45:49.440]  son or daughter goes across the street to plant the park with their friends
[01:45:49.440 --> 01:45:54.720]  you're going to jail if you're white you're going to jail if you're a
[01:45:54.720 --> 01:45:58.240]  citizen you're going to jail your kids are gone but if you're part of this
[01:45:58.240 --> 01:46:03.880]  other lawlessness and the collapse of the country you're okay and let me just
[01:46:03.880 --> 01:46:06.920]  tell those people that are coming up here just so you know those American
[01:46:06.920 --> 01:46:16.200]  Jails are really cold they're complaining about how cold they were yeah well
[01:46:16.200 --> 01:46:18.800]  they complained the food didn't get enough it's a lot better what the troops
[01:46:18.800 --> 01:46:23.880]  get I mean I just can't it's just it's just the hypocrisy and the lawless evil
[01:46:23.880 --> 01:46:27.240]  of the government I mean in the past this stuff didn't come out about corrupt
[01:46:27.240 --> 01:46:30.080]  governments it was going on but you didn't hear about it in the age of you
[01:46:30.080 --> 01:46:33.680]  know just newspapers because they could suppress it in a tyranny they're doing it
[01:46:33.680 --> 01:46:37.760]  now out in the open and don't even care
[01:46:42.400 --> 01:46:46.240]  hmm I mean I've been around so-called liberals that are so obsessed quote with
[01:46:46.240 --> 01:46:50.680]  shoulder and I told this story there was a UT professor one day when I was with
[01:46:50.680 --> 01:46:54.040]  friends at their house fishing at their boat dock and they share a boat dock
[01:46:54.040 --> 01:47:01.040]  with the neighbors and this woman this anthropology lady showed up I'm not
[01:47:01.040 --> 01:47:06.560]  kidding with gypsies and with the head guy that's like the most famous gypsy in
[01:47:06.560 --> 01:47:09.920]  the US she's a UT professor I forget we gotta give him a show he'd been up at the
[01:47:09.920 --> 01:47:13.840]  house they were having some event and the woman wanted to prove in her political
[01:47:13.840 --> 01:47:17.480]  correctness I was bad she goes do you not like gypsies and I went I'm just fishing
[01:47:17.480 --> 01:47:21.680]  hey what how you doing she was somewhat of an attractive professor I'm sitting
[01:47:21.680 --> 01:47:24.600]  there talking to this lady and I'm fishing trying to catch cat one of those
[01:47:24.600 --> 01:47:28.320]  a lot of diverse groups of gypsies is also the pike ease that are Irish gypsies
[01:47:28.320 --> 01:47:32.120]  and I think it kind of is part of the culture that they're allowed to rob
[01:47:32.120 --> 01:47:38.480]  people I mean that that is admitted but I mean I'm not against anybody but okay
[01:47:38.480 --> 01:47:41.760]  it's not like the Aztecs had a culture of cutting people's hearts out I'm not
[01:47:41.760 --> 01:47:45.800]  against people from Mesoamerica you know the druids I'm probably related to
[01:47:45.800 --> 01:47:48.560]  druids but they cut people's you know hearts out and stuff and I mean you know
[01:47:48.560 --> 01:47:52.000]  and of course they're always freaked out that someone's actually intellectual
[01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:55.640]  in those history it's like oh yeah well just you just don't give us any problems
[01:47:55.640 --> 01:47:58.760]  because you know they're gypsies and they're wonderful people and I'm going
[01:47:58.760 --> 01:48:07.200]  okay all right we're gonna go ride jet skis later and then she looks at my son
[01:48:07.200 --> 01:48:11.720]  it was about nine then he has a birthmark on the side of his head Rex and
[01:48:11.720 --> 01:48:18.920]  she goes did somebody hit you was something she looked at me and I didn't
[01:48:18.920 --> 01:48:21.320]  even give her the power she wanted I knew what he would say he goes no that's
[01:48:21.320 --> 01:48:24.080]  my birthmark she goes oh I'm sorry I was just checking to make sure you're all
[01:48:24.080 --> 01:48:28.280]  right she was looking at me it's a power deal these people are taking over
[01:48:28.280 --> 01:48:31.360]  there's a lot of well-meaning liberals that mean well really want to help kids
[01:48:31.360 --> 01:48:35.120]  and stuff and there's social workers that help old people I got family that
[01:48:35.120 --> 01:48:38.720]  are social workers and help all people I got a family that work it over the
[01:48:38.720 --> 01:48:42.080]  years and gave everything they had years ago one guy come with a patent made a
[01:48:42.080 --> 01:48:45.040]  bunch of money millions of dollars give it all Salvation Army work for them for
[01:48:45.040 --> 01:48:48.720]  40 years you know there are good people out there serving they're good police
[01:48:48.720 --> 01:48:52.360]  officers but I'm telling you a lot of them are like cult members because I
[01:48:52.360 --> 01:48:58.560]  wasn't talking about gypsies and I wasn't talking about you know all this
[01:48:58.560 --> 01:49:03.960]  stuff and the gypsies by the way were digging in Lake Travis where the water
[01:49:03.960 --> 01:49:11.280]  was down to find era heads and stuff so I actually went over and hung out with
[01:49:11.280 --> 01:49:15.720]  them and found an era head with them I actually got along with the gypsies but
[01:49:15.720 --> 01:49:24.600]  the point is that it is just crazy man I just can't handle it anymore age of
[01:49:24.600 --> 01:49:30.120]  sexual consent is 12 in Mexico I thought I would just add that's why there's so
[01:49:30.120 --> 01:49:35.920]  much quote child rape going on and here's the deal in 1845 if you were in
[01:49:35.920 --> 01:49:41.440]  Texas the age of consent was 13 the truth is the Mexicans if they come from
[01:49:41.440 --> 01:49:46.640]  rural areas or like cavemen and I don't mean that insultingly I called me to get
[01:49:46.640 --> 01:49:52.400]  him back on the show Bundy Clive and Bundy I called him a caveman exactly
[01:49:52.400 --> 01:49:55.200]  the same folks I mean you could take Clive and Bundy that's why he's like I
[01:49:55.200 --> 01:49:59.960]  like the Spanish coming over here they want to work because you know not
[01:49:59.960 --> 01:50:02.560]  making fun of them that's how he is because they're wearing cowboy hats blue
[01:50:02.560 --> 01:50:08.080]  jeans it's basically the same people now you try to go out to some Mormon
[01:50:08.080 --> 01:50:10.400]  community and marry a 13 year old you're gonna go to jail for being a
[01:50:10.400 --> 01:50:14.360]  cow molester I personally am not attracted to that I like full grown
[01:50:14.360 --> 01:50:17.960]  you know women the whole nine yards but the whole issue is this is gonna be a
[01:50:17.960 --> 01:50:23.320]  major culture clash because all over the country the illegals are trying to
[01:50:23.320 --> 01:50:27.800]  pick up your 12 and 13 year old daughters and it's just a fact that in
[01:50:27.800 --> 01:50:33.560]  Mexico that's what goes on now granted you get killed in Mexico going after a
[01:50:33.560 --> 01:50:37.640]  senior Rita who's not a senior Rita whose parents don't have them out dating
[01:50:37.640 --> 01:50:44.960]  but an unaccompanied girl in Italy or in Mexico anywhere old world is up for
[01:50:44.960 --> 01:50:50.400]  grabs folks so get ready for that and that's not race racism that's
[01:50:50.400 --> 01:50:56.600]  sociology that's anthropology that's psychology that's cultural facts we'll
[01:50:56.600 --> 01:51:00.760]  be back with your phone calls straight ahead stay with us teenagers like me
[01:51:00.760 --> 01:51:04.680]  used to think our parents were just weird because they put their phones and

[01:54:21.680 --> 01:54:28.680]  see political correctness is so strong in the west
[01:54:28.680 --> 01:54:36.800]  that mainline feminist will not even criticize in any way sexual mutilation
[01:54:36.800 --> 01:54:40.840]  of millions of Muslim women women not being allowed to drive women not being
[01:54:40.840 --> 01:54:48.880]  allowed to show their faces but they will tell women you don't want a manly
[01:54:48.880 --> 01:54:54.000]  man who's even strong you want a metrosexual because a man with male
[01:54:54.000 --> 01:55:01.480]  features is anti-female so you can't be a manly man but it's okay for the radical
[01:55:01.480 --> 01:55:10.360]  Muslims to mutilate their newborn baby daughters and it's racist and everything
[01:55:10.360 --> 01:55:14.600]  else I'm close-minded and because I'm giving a stereotypical the hobbyist
[01:55:14.600 --> 01:55:20.880]  critique no I'm not giving a stereotypical it's a fact and it shows how
[01:55:20.880 --> 01:55:27.040]  the system gets away with whatever they want whenever they want and use
[01:55:27.040 --> 01:55:30.160]  political correctness to neutralize everyone and the people pushing
[01:55:30.160 --> 01:55:34.840]  political correctness are truly the authoritarians I mean everybody
[01:55:34.840 --> 01:55:42.040]  recognizes there's a political stunt but it's worse than that because every vote
[01:55:42.040 --> 01:55:47.040]  they're taking like that means a vote they're not taken to actually help you
[01:55:47.040 --> 01:55:53.360]  you know when they had taken 50 votes to repeal the affordable carry that that
[01:55:53.360 --> 01:55:57.760]  was time that could have been spent working constructively to help you on
[01:55:57.760 --> 01:56:02.400]  some things that's right you haven't gotten all your free goodies because
[01:56:02.400 --> 01:56:07.800]  they've not been doing what I want so I'm just doing it executively as a
[01:56:07.800 --> 01:56:13.240]  dictator let's go to Ray in New Jersey Ray thanks for calling what are you
[01:56:13.240 --> 01:56:19.120]  calling in about today you know it's a couple things by many I'm calling one
[01:56:19.120 --> 01:56:25.480]  about the concern about the fact that the globalists just might be blackmailing
[01:56:25.480 --> 01:56:33.160]  those in authority in this country that are not part of that well there's no
[01:56:33.160 --> 01:56:37.640]  there's no if ands or buts I've interviewed at least five top NSA
[01:56:37.640 --> 01:56:43.200]  whistleblowers and they have all said that blackmail has been going on for
[01:56:43.200 --> 01:56:47.800]  decades and it's now peaked so so yes sir it's come out in the British press
[01:56:47.800 --> 01:56:52.320]  that their NSA spies on people as well I'm actually talking up on an
[01:56:52.320 --> 01:56:56.800]  individual basis but on a much broader basis whether they would have no no
[01:56:56.800 --> 01:57:01.560]  question whatsoever about putting an EMI electromagnetic impulse over this
[01:57:01.560 --> 01:57:07.360]  country and and doing a number on us and some people could be concerned about us
[01:57:07.360 --> 01:57:16.800]  actually getting hurt what do you think of that well I tend to agree with you
[01:57:16.800 --> 01:57:20.200]  that there's a lot of different forms of blackmail going on I mean how do we get
[01:57:20.200 --> 01:57:25.720]  around this that's my concern I'm actually at a point and I'm I don't
[01:57:25.720 --> 01:57:29.120]  want to be at the fetus and I was never at the fetus I'm 63 years old I had
[01:57:29.120 --> 01:57:33.160]  never I've never been at the fetus yet I scratch my head on this and all that is
[01:57:33.160 --> 01:57:38.680]  going down and it blows my mind just this week I contacted my governor on two
[01:57:38.680 --> 01:57:43.960]  separations concerning the border crisis asking very simple questions how
[01:57:43.960 --> 01:57:50.760]  many have been brought into our state and what counties are they into in our
[01:57:50.760 --> 01:57:54.480]  third question what school systems are being partane by the way they don't
[01:57:54.480 --> 01:57:58.000]  even know they just deploy them wherever they want to go that's what's
[01:57:58.000 --> 01:58:02.360]  crazy about this is it undermines and discredits their entire police state
[01:58:02.360 --> 01:58:07.400]  claiming that they keep a close eye on us because they want to keep us safe no
[01:58:07.400 --> 01:58:12.920]  they see us as their property that's not behaving and can still vote so they're
[01:58:12.920 --> 01:58:19.760]  bringing in new property to outvote us it's a very simple equation I agree with
[01:58:19.760 --> 01:58:26.680]  that yet governor Bill Haslam from Tennessee he found out how many were
[01:58:26.680 --> 01:58:30.560]  being put into his state by simple simply going on the health and human
[01:58:30.560 --> 01:58:35.400]  resources website and how many did they say I'm sorry I didn't write that
[01:58:35.400 --> 01:58:40.560]  take your time it's got to be hundreds of thousands we'll be right back

[02:00:41.120 --> 02:00:46.400]  year go ahead sir hey Alex this is Eric can you hear me I can hear you loud and
[02:00:46.400 --> 02:00:53.200]  clear thanks sir I'm 21 years old I'm in Texas and I just recently went through a
[02:00:53.200 --> 02:00:59.440]  motorcycle accident on January 2nd and I just I didn't really believe people when
[02:00:59.440 --> 02:01:03.080]  they told me health care was going down so I actually went through it and it
[02:01:03.080 --> 02:01:10.760]  just amazes me how how well how bad it's gotten
[02:01:10.760 --> 02:01:17.280]  well America is turning into a third world country how was the experience
[02:01:17.280 --> 02:01:23.520]  bad well I was in a coma at first and when I came out of it I literally broke
[02:01:23.520 --> 02:01:30.280]  three parts of my skull my face my nose my femur my pelvis and I was begging for
[02:01:30.280 --> 02:01:34.080]  over an hour and a half of water my first day out of the coma like begging
[02:01:34.080 --> 02:01:37.760]  for water finally I'd throw my water cup at the window to a nurse that was
[02:01:37.760 --> 02:01:43.880]  literally ten yards away and it's the way that people treated me like you
[02:01:43.880 --> 02:01:47.080]  treat me like I was useless and there was nothing they kept trying to give me
[02:01:47.080 --> 02:01:50.240]  these blood thinner shots when my neurologist said not to give them because
[02:01:50.240 --> 02:01:53.640]  I had a brain bleed right they would bring multiple nurses and try to force
[02:01:53.640 --> 02:01:58.600]  them on me yeah well that's the thing is it's such a big bureaucracy and now they
[02:01:58.600 --> 02:02:02.640]  teach more and more there's two conflicting systems the old Hippocratic
[02:02:02.640 --> 02:02:09.080]  oath of Hippocrates versus the death panel model that anyone who's hurt is
[02:02:09.080 --> 02:02:12.720]  basically worthless to the system especially if you don't have a giant
[02:02:12.720 --> 02:02:16.960]  insurance policy or you're not reigning cash on them and it varies hospital to
[02:02:16.960 --> 02:02:21.400]  hospital but this has been done by design it's only gonna get worse and the
[02:02:21.400 --> 02:02:25.040]  death panels are all confirmed and the average authoritarian that calls
[02:02:25.040 --> 02:02:29.920]  themselves a liberal says yeah let's kill kill all the un-firm that's how
[02:02:29.920 --> 02:02:35.960]  we'll get more money for us that's how we'll get more welfare money well the
[02:02:35.960 --> 02:02:39.920]  vets don't get good care only the you know illegals are getting the care right
[02:02:39.920 --> 02:02:44.040]  now in the welfare system they get preferential treatment put it to you that
[02:02:44.040 --> 02:02:48.320]  way because they're needed as the incentive to draw more people here to
[02:02:48.320 --> 02:02:53.800]  be slaves they'll all be annihilated as well let's thank you Eric let's go to
[02:02:53.800 --> 02:03:00.120]  Phil and FEMA region 3 go ahead Alex pleasure to talk to you sir thanks talk to you go ahead
[02:03:00.120 --> 02:03:05.320]  all right I wanted just for everybody's benefit let you know a personal story of
[02:03:05.320 --> 02:03:10.720]  how I became a member it's actually down at a bar and somebody had written in
[02:03:10.720 --> 02:03:16.720]  Sharpie on the bathroom door info wars comm I said what's that and have been a
[02:03:16.720 --> 02:03:22.160]  member ever since so you know I just ordered 500 business cards and a couple
[02:03:22.160 --> 02:03:26.640]  hundred of the bumper stickers so I think maybe more folks should do that it's
[02:03:26.640 --> 02:03:29.720]  all fine well to have a conversation with somebody but it'd be nice to have
[02:03:29.720 --> 02:03:35.360]  something to leave them with to remember so well I agree with you we have an area
[02:03:35.360 --> 02:03:41.760]  on info or store.com of bumper stickers magazines business cards that have
[02:03:41.760 --> 02:03:48.520]  info wars.com on them at cost so people can buy those from us at cost and then
[02:03:48.520 --> 02:03:51.960]  give them out to friends and family it's a great outreach so thank you so much for
[02:03:51.960 --> 02:03:56.440]  that support sir. Exactly and one more thing if I may yes you know being in

[02:09:29.420 --> 02:09:33.340]  lady we'll play a clip of that the full clip here in just a few minutes
[02:09:33.340 --> 02:09:38.900]  Michelle Dowry the Obama phone lady is back in studio with us because the
[02:09:38.900 --> 02:09:44.300]  Obama deception to has turned out to be a film five years in the making that's
[02:09:44.300 --> 02:09:47.260]  why I've never released it because it just it just continues to tell the whole
[02:09:47.260 --> 02:09:51.900]  story the whole saga a story of collectivism a story of betrayal bigger
[02:09:51.900 --> 02:09:55.580]  than Obama it shows how the Republicans are working with them how they're
[02:09:55.580 --> 02:09:58.740]  controlled by these corporate interests that are engaged in psychological
[02:09:58.740 --> 02:10:03.140]  warfare on basically a helpless population because it's so sophisticated
[02:10:03.140 --> 02:10:12.380]  but also so simple at the same time so Michelle is here with us today in studio
[02:10:12.380 --> 02:10:17.100]  from Cleveland Ohio to tape again for Obama deception to where we can see her
[02:10:17.100 --> 02:10:23.140]  over the years as her views on Obama began to change because we talked to her
[02:10:23.140 --> 02:10:27.700]  she was here a year ago now almost a year ago and we're gonna see now how
[02:10:27.700 --> 02:10:32.620]  they've changed even more and so she's here with us in studio killing two birds
[02:10:32.620 --> 02:10:36.900]  with one stone again here taping for Obama deception to but also in studio
[02:10:36.900 --> 02:10:40.380]  with us I hope you had a good trip they're here to Austin yes I did it was
[02:10:40.380 --> 02:10:44.740]  very lovely and relaxing but it's a roasting hot outside yeah compared to

[02:10:50.980 --> 02:10:55.940]  about 80 or 90 so it made me feel different make me want to go back and
[02:10:55.940 --> 02:11:00.500]  get in the water I hear you don't go get in the water yeah and we should go to
[02:11:00.500 --> 02:11:04.980]  Barton Springs today yeah this sounds good it's 68 degrees though I don't care
[02:11:04.980 --> 02:11:09.060]  I can get spring fed okay good swim like a fish good let's look maybe we should
[02:11:09.060 --> 02:11:14.180]  that's it we'll go we'll take Obama phone lady I wanted to take her somewhere
[02:11:14.180 --> 02:11:18.060]  you got a swimsuit yeah I got a swim you brought one I brought one I just wanted
[02:11:18.060 --> 02:11:21.820]  to get on the air and make me look pretty and then I can go look real rough
[02:11:21.820 --> 02:11:26.980]  okay guys somebody needs I had my backpack in my car but I took it out so
[02:11:26.980 --> 02:11:31.940]  it's still it's at my house it's sitting on the dining room table someone needs to
[02:11:31.940 --> 02:11:39.420]  go right now to my place probably Buckley and bring my my my blue backpack
[02:11:39.420 --> 02:11:44.260]  that's that's perfect for the new Obama film we'll go to Barton Springs alright
[02:11:44.260 --> 02:11:49.300]  sounds good to me oh my gosh it's gonna be awesome you ready to go swimming I'm
[02:11:49.300 --> 02:11:53.180]  ready to jump in the water hey what do you think if now if a nine-year-old kid
[02:11:53.180 --> 02:11:56.500]  goes to the public pool that has lifeguards and everything without their
[02:11:56.500 --> 02:12:03.500]  parents the parents go to jail now I think that sucks cuz if I drop my kid off
[02:12:03.500 --> 02:12:12.500]  at the pool and lifeguards are there you know that's a police state yeah what
[02:12:12.500 --> 02:12:16.500]  about if you live across from the park and you send your seven nine ten-year-old
[02:12:16.500 --> 02:12:20.340]  seven-year-old parents been arrested nine-year-old ten-year-olds and then they
[02:12:20.340 --> 02:12:24.940]  take their kids because their child plays across the street the park I think
[02:12:24.940 --> 02:12:30.580]  that sucks does that sound like land of the free home of the brave yeah because
[02:12:30.580 --> 02:12:34.740]  that is directly a liberal nanny state movement to do that it sounds like a
[02:12:34.740 --> 02:12:39.160]  big prison to me yeah that is but you know so in certain parts of America you
[02:12:39.160 --> 02:12:43.540]  got different laws and rules let's say it's not a law they just say we have
[02:12:43.540 --> 02:12:49.540]  decided that endangered the child oh no it's a blank check hmm wow this sucks
[02:12:49.540 --> 02:12:53.180]  you know all your kids five pounds overweight we're gonna take your kid
[02:12:53.180 --> 02:12:57.180]  from you now they start with cases with the kids 200 pounds overweight but see
[02:12:57.180 --> 02:13:04.260]  once the president said Obama phone lady what happens well you know now with
[02:13:04.260 --> 02:13:08.580]  this president stuff it's a lot of junk on the point people haven't seen the
[02:13:08.580 --> 02:13:11.900]  footage of you yet maybe we should take you shooting actually would you rather
[02:13:11.900 --> 02:13:16.460]  go shooting or swimming at Barton Springs I rather go swimming but I might

[02:14:20.220 --> 02:14:25.060]  what I'm working I can leave the cooking business away took me to the new
[02:14:25.060 --> 02:14:29.900]  Heights in Texas Austin Texas on the Alex Jones show yeah well see that's
[02:14:29.900 --> 02:14:33.660]  what's all about the American dream and that's what government sells that it
[02:14:33.660 --> 02:14:37.460]  will give you that dream are you aware of the fact that they're cutting off the
[02:14:37.460 --> 02:14:41.060]  healthcare to most the troops including Staff Sergeant Joe Biggs retired has been
[02:14:41.060 --> 02:14:44.180]  coughing up blood for a year he can't get into the VA they keep changing the
[02:14:44.180 --> 02:14:47.460]  appointment but if you come in from Honduras nothing against those people
[02:14:47.460 --> 02:14:50.700]  but you get red carpet treatment well why do you think that is and what's your
[02:14:50.700 --> 02:14:57.220]  take on it I think that sucks too because this man that serve the country
[02:14:57.220 --> 02:15:00.820]  that's the one you're talking about was young up the blood then serve the
[02:15:00.820 --> 02:15:05.020]  country VA or whatever how about you go shooting with him oh me and him and make

[02:17:11.660 --> 02:17:15.980]  because I make a hundred forty five a week so by me not working with two kids
[02:17:15.980 --> 02:17:19.380]  it's been kind of hard I lived in that house last time I was here I bought a
[02:17:19.380 --> 02:17:24.100]  house when I went back for $4,000 and it was you can imagine with $4,000 to
[02:17:24.100 --> 02:17:29.100]  give you a house almost abandoned no windows no floors no sinks so we had to
[02:17:29.100 --> 02:17:34.220]  use all appliance upstairs here I am as I got 40 a year ago I could walk like
[02:17:34.220 --> 02:17:38.580]  when I seen you couldn't walk now I'm in the same boat my knee so they wanted to
[02:17:38.580 --> 02:17:43.220]  do surgery I was at 270 to he said he gotta leaves to 240 I didn't get to 240
[02:17:43.220 --> 02:17:48.220]  so I'm disabled here I am applying for disability and I'm working people say
[02:17:48.220 --> 02:17:52.940]  are you crazy no I'm real well you know because of Obamacare they don't get
[02:17:52.940 --> 02:17:57.260]  people 40-hour jobs anymore really they cut almost everybody down to 30 20 hours
[02:17:57.260 --> 02:18:00.820]  you're saying the job you have you you can't even get more hours I can't get
[02:18:00.820 --> 02:18:05.860]  no hours I can't walk I can't stand on my leg that long so they gave me a I work
[02:18:05.860 --> 02:18:10.660]  at an owl paw pain like four hours or five hours a day every Thursday I pick
[02:18:10.660 --> 02:18:14.940]  up a check a hundred forty hundred thirty five hours a week but by me how are
[02:18:14.940 --> 02:18:19.620]  you supposed to live like that but but imagine imagine because it because it
[02:18:19.620 --> 02:18:23.700]  is discriminatory the veterans are being put on secret death list death panels
[02:18:23.700 --> 02:18:30.260]  yes there's a tax on poor people on on their payrolls in Obamacare right and
[02:18:30.260 --> 02:18:34.060]  Obama held out when people say I'm gonna free car a free house thank you mr.
[02:18:34.060 --> 02:18:39.060]  president a lady crying you know she says I've been living in a car we need a
[02:18:39.060 --> 02:18:44.860]  house remember that lady in Florida right he didn't help her no I didn't so
[02:18:44.860 --> 02:18:50.580]  so my issue is it's it's the holding out the hope when it's a fraud right it's
[02:18:50.580 --> 02:18:54.420]  really is a fraud we're gonna skip this network break Obama phone lady is here
[02:18:54.420 --> 02:18:57.740]  with us in studio I just want to speak to the fact that it's like the lottery
[02:18:57.740 --> 02:19:01.420]  ticket idea or the idea of the get rich quick schemes they've taken the
[02:19:01.420 --> 02:19:05.980]  prosperity away from America all people wants a factory job or a service job
[02:19:05.980 --> 02:19:10.140]  they'll pay a livable you know wage but they devalue the dollar they set up an
[02:19:10.140 --> 02:19:15.420]  economic system they put taxes in to break poor people to the fact of pushing
[02:19:15.420 --> 02:19:21.060]  them on to the welfare roles and that's a plan called clowered and piven hmm to
[02:19:21.060 --> 02:19:25.700]  make it impossible to be able to make a living to force you to collapse all and
[02:19:25.700 --> 02:19:30.180]  to go on welfare that's so they control you that's true but then you can't even
[02:19:30.180 --> 02:19:35.900]  get on the welfare anymore because you are yesterday's folks that help get
[02:19:35.900 --> 02:19:40.100]  Obama in and the Democrats and the Republicans as well in many cases now
[02:19:40.100 --> 02:19:44.900]  they've got all of central and South America right and just like they sucker
[02:19:44.900 --> 02:19:47.740]  of the troops in to join they're gonna get college and health care which they
[02:19:47.740 --> 02:19:51.500]  don't end up getting right there again this is all about suckering the next
[02:19:51.500 --> 02:19:55.940]  group it's it's called pimping pimping you're right with a double D a double
[02:19:55.940 --> 02:19:59.660]  dose you're right they pimped us they pimped us just like last year when I
[02:19:59.660 --> 02:20:03.740]  was out there and Obama working for Obama and Iran and he was right there
[02:20:03.740 --> 02:20:09.220]  they pimped me the man who got me on the video he pimped me I got over a hundred
[02:20:09.220 --> 02:20:13.420]  million viewers and I ain't get a dollar but thank God for you Alex because if it
[02:20:13.420 --> 02:20:16.980]  wasn't for you and that man at Walmart I'd be wouldn't be at where I'm in today
[02:20:16.980 --> 02:20:20.340]  and I thank you for that because I never flew well if we had more we'd give him
[02:20:20.340 --> 02:20:24.420]  more than $4,000 but I thought that's good enough $4,000 enough for me it's
[02:20:24.420 --> 02:20:29.460]  better than what I had I'm coming we want we're gonna budget in if you can
[02:20:29.460 --> 02:20:33.340]  stay like next Tuesday we'll just we'll just make it $5,000 I'll be here $5,000
[02:20:33.340 --> 02:20:37.540]  how's that sound you got it I'm staying and that's our great listeners out there
[02:20:37.540 --> 02:20:42.180]  and listeners I want you to know it's not even the money it's just trying to get
[02:20:42.180 --> 02:20:47.940]  somewhere right and that's what it is because what they belligerently told me
[02:20:47.940 --> 02:20:51.540]  a year and a half man I could change the street black the yellow I'm the
[02:20:51.540 --> 02:20:55.020]  no I know you offered to come down here for free last year about pay for the
[02:20:55.020 --> 02:20:58.140]  ticket and then and I said well let's see and once you got down here and you
[02:20:58.140 --> 02:21:00.740]  told me how you were working jobs cleaning houses man you're showing me
[02:21:00.740 --> 02:21:04.700]  the worst so since the pictures of it and stuff and and and and how you
[02:21:04.700 --> 02:21:07.300]  couldn't take care of your kids and stuff and didn't want to go on welfare I
[02:21:07.300 --> 02:21:10.140]  said well we're well young let me let me help you a little bit because the
[02:21:10.140 --> 02:21:13.500]  media will spend say oh she's there criticizing the Lord and Savior Obama
[02:21:13.500 --> 02:21:17.220]  because Alex Jones is paying her to do that no no I'm simply trying to pay you
[02:21:17.220 --> 02:21:21.500]  for your time that's what we do right right right and then Alex I really want
[02:21:21.500 --> 02:21:26.420]  to tell you about this because I had so many traumatic things come to me to get

[02:22:14.980 --> 02:22:19.060]  here one of them is a former special forces guy who they tried to put on
[02:22:19.060 --> 02:22:22.220]  psychotropic and then took him right off of them I want to take some phone calls
[02:22:22.220 --> 02:22:27.660]  because they've been holding Phil's still there right John fantastic we're
[02:22:27.660 --> 02:22:31.260]  gonna go to him coming up at the bottom of the hour in about 10 minutes so stay

[02:22:34.620 --> 02:22:42.340]  and then Tyler Dr. McCoy Michael Joel and others my issue here is I wanted you
[02:22:42.340 --> 02:22:45.780]  to come to town and because I had no idea what you were gonna come what you
[02:22:45.780 --> 02:22:49.980]  were gonna say a guy a listener met you in Walmart said Alex Jones put a
[02:22:49.980 --> 02:22:54.660]  bounty out for a couple thousand dollars whoever could find you to get you on
[02:22:54.660 --> 02:23:01.340]  air and then you came down here and I didn't promise anything but then I ended
[02:23:01.340 --> 02:23:05.940]  up trying to help you just because it was your time but but but with Obama God
[02:23:05.940 --> 02:23:09.980]  but with but but it's not that big of a deal my point is I'm explaining that with
[02:23:09.980 --> 02:23:13.700]  Obama he did hold out that it was gonna be milk and honey everything was gonna
[02:23:13.700 --> 02:23:17.100]  be great and since he's been in and the Republicans are involved in this as well
[02:23:17.100 --> 02:23:21.940]  but he's the great closer he's the great seller he's the guy getting away with it
[02:23:21.940 --> 02:23:27.540]  making it look liberal and nice they have given tens of trillions of dollars in
[02:23:27.540 --> 02:23:32.660]  tax-free banker bailouts to mainly foreign banks and people like Warren
[02:23:32.660 --> 02:23:38.940]  Buffett right okay so imagine if they'd have just given that money to
[02:23:38.940 --> 02:23:45.060]  citizens which I which is immoral because then people can start voting to
[02:23:45.060 --> 02:23:48.940]  rob the other group it's wealth transfer you're only supposed to help those that
[02:23:48.940 --> 02:23:51.940]  are really in trouble not help them because they vote for you but let's
[02:23:51.940 --> 02:23:59.540]  just say so it was nonpartisan every American got a check for $20,000 that
[02:23:59.540 --> 02:24:02.940]  would have been less money than they gave the bankers in the first round of
[02:24:02.940 --> 02:24:07.740]  bailouts they would have spent that buying cars get paying rent buying food
[02:24:07.740 --> 02:24:13.020]  making the economy go it would devalue the dollar some which cheats everybody
[02:24:13.020 --> 02:24:16.980]  but at least we'd be cheating ourselves right and getting something up front then
[02:24:16.980 --> 02:24:20.980]  at least there's some benefit and you can debate economically whether that's
[02:24:20.980 --> 02:24:24.300]  good or not right you keep doing it though you become Mexico with the peso
[02:24:24.300 --> 02:24:30.380]  see the economics right instead they create inflation food prices going up
[02:24:30.380 --> 02:24:35.100]  everything going up that hurts the little people raise taxes on the little
[02:24:35.100 --> 02:24:39.700]  people with the carbon taxes and the payroll taxes and Obamacare and and
[02:24:39.700 --> 02:24:43.220]  making people get their hours cut under Obamacare that's all Obamacare and death
[02:24:43.220 --> 02:24:47.380]  panels they sit there and lie and say it's not in the bill when it is now it
[02:24:47.380 --> 02:24:53.780]  all goes through it's just starting to hit that's beyond lying that is so cold
[02:24:53.780 --> 02:24:58.300]  blooded because because they could have just given people money right like he
[02:24:58.300 --> 02:25:03.420]  did when he gave us all those Obama checks one income tax you got a bomber
[02:25:03.420 --> 02:25:08.500]  check that wasn't Clinton that was Obama you know and I tell anybody when I've
[02:25:08.500 --> 02:25:13.980]  worked for him who's phone you on Obama we didn't know no better that's just like
[02:25:13.980 --> 02:25:19.180]  if when Clinton gave us the phones he was gone out of president Obama got all
[02:25:19.180 --> 02:25:23.620]  that picture you know when you go in the projects and Cleveland I'm from for
[02:25:23.620 --> 02:25:28.220]  around me for what who's phone you on in the projects and they got no cell phone
[02:25:28.220 --> 02:25:33.540]  Obama by the way I remember when I got a check for like 300 bucks a tax return it
[02:25:33.540 --> 02:25:37.140]  was a special tax return I should done a show on that this is like in 2003 or
[02:25:37.140 --> 02:25:42.220]  something and it said the president has directed this check out of the whatever
[02:25:42.220 --> 02:25:46.500]  fund and it was literally saying Bush had given me a check that's the
[02:25:46.500 --> 02:25:50.580]  Republicans adopting democratic tax right what does your check say when they
[02:25:50.580 --> 02:25:57.420]  said it was an Obama check my text they said Obama Obama funds never mess with a
[02:25:57.420 --> 02:26:02.020]  fool's that worked at three almost three months never said a fool money or it but
[02:26:02.020 --> 02:26:06.420]  again see they do that knowing that the average you that the average working
[02:26:06.420 --> 02:26:09.820]  person gets a check for a couple hundred bucks and they think wow they they gave
[02:26:09.820 --> 02:26:13.780]  me this meanwhile they're cutting your hours they're devaluing your dollars
[02:26:13.780 --> 02:26:17.020]  they're raising your payroll taxes all the stuff hidden you don't know why the
[02:26:17.020 --> 02:26:20.620]  checks get smaller because it's all technical right now now is that evil
[02:26:20.620 --> 02:26:23.540]  that's evil I want you to look at that camera
[02:26:23.540 --> 02:26:27.420]  bomb a phone lady right there let's go full screen to her guys I want you to
[02:26:27.420 --> 02:26:32.020]  look at that camera and I want you to just whatever you have to say cuz did I
[02:26:32.020 --> 02:26:35.260]  talk to you before he came on there today I haven't even seen you telling you
[02:26:35.260 --> 02:26:38.540]  what I feel from the bottom no no but I'm serious cuz I mean I saw you for 30
[02:26:38.540 --> 02:26:41.300]  seconds during a break gave you a hug we've not talked about what you're gonna
[02:26:41.300 --> 02:26:44.540]  talk about now we should because we get to more points but because these are so
[02:26:44.540 --> 02:26:48.100]  unscripted but you've got the floor what do you want to guarantee the
[02:26:48.100 --> 02:26:52.660]  Democratic top folks will watch this what do you want to say to Obama I want
[02:26:52.660 --> 02:26:58.160]  to say this to you Obama I'm Michelle dowry right up under your wife on the
[02:26:58.160 --> 02:27:01.380]  internet I don't know nothing but the day when I leave I'm gonna have a phone
[02:27:01.380 --> 02:27:05.580]  so I can look at it myself cuz I never check my emails or anything whoopee
[02:27:05.580 --> 02:27:10.260]  Goldberg want me on the show a couple of them want me out but I want to say one
[02:27:10.260 --> 02:27:15.220]  thing when I hustled and worked for you you told me yourself that I would get a
[02:27:15.220 --> 02:27:19.380]  check back I would get this out no you said I'll give my check back cuz I got
[02:27:19.380 --> 02:27:24.300]  a 12 and a 17 and I went to the shelter before I live where I live now thank God
[02:27:24.300 --> 02:27:30.260]  for Alex and seeing how to live cuz I couldn't live with the money the money
[02:27:30.260 --> 02:27:35.020]  you gave me I knew heights I went and bought a house and got a house now and
[02:27:35.020 --> 02:27:39.420]  it was a condemned house I don't have no money to fix it I own a home and still
[02:27:39.420 --> 02:27:44.620]  lived in the shelter cuz I couldn't make it now I got a job make it 8 8 50 an
[02:27:44.620 --> 02:27:51.460]  hour 15 20 hours a week that's no money 150 dollars for two kids but I really do
[02:27:51.460 --> 02:27:57.340]  believe if I was getting a welfare check once a month and I'm working I can
[02:27:57.340 --> 02:28:03.260]  make it because the rent light and gas take care with Obama check that well
[02:28:03.260 --> 02:28:07.420]  for a check what it did for me and now I'm not getting it and you've been in
[02:28:07.420 --> 02:28:11.140]  president a couple years I haven't seen any too much changes because I'm on
[02:28:11.140 --> 02:28:17.340]  welfare and by me getting a part-time job quote unquote I'm still eligible for
[02:28:17.340 --> 02:28:21.620]  my care source from the welfare free of no charge me my daughter and my son
[02:28:21.620 --> 02:28:27.780]  glasses medical all that's took and care of I'm talking about cash to pay my rent
[02:28:27.780 --> 02:28:34.380]  to buy toilet tissue and things that I need it's been hard I just think that
[02:28:34.380 --> 02:28:39.900]  keep praying to God and me telling the real thing cuz first of all whatever I
[02:28:39.900 --> 02:28:43.860]  do I'm a gift to God cuz it's a blessing for Alex Jones to call me back
[02:28:43.860 --> 02:28:48.660]  and put me on the show to tell the real because everything you said it I
[02:28:48.660 --> 02:28:53.380]  haven't seen it yet you know I did see you give medical couple streets in
[02:28:53.380 --> 02:28:58.020]  Cleveland or newer but I really haven't seen it you know and I see people
[02:28:58.020 --> 02:29:03.500]  struggling like me for years and years and years and years that's why always
[02:29:03.500 --> 02:29:09.180]  when I got off of the streets and drugs I turned my life to God God did this for
[02:29:09.180 --> 02:29:17.020]  me not Obama not not Alex Jones God did this and I really do hurt from what you
[02:29:17.020 --> 02:29:21.700]  did to me because I thought you were gonna do more especially when I got over
[02:29:21.700 --> 02:29:25.180]  nine or ten million viewers right up under Michelle Obama and you didn't
[02:29:25.180 --> 02:29:29.140]  even email me or you didn't even call me and say thanks for the work you done
[02:29:29.140 --> 02:29:34.060]  alright Michelle stay there we're gonna come back and we're gonna take some
[02:29:34.060 --> 02:29:38.580]  phone calls but I want to elaborate see this is the mindset they've they've
[02:29:38.580 --> 02:29:42.620]  brought everybody up in that the president can give you things and and it
[02:29:42.620 --> 02:29:47.540]  help you but if he starts doing that to enough people the country will collapse
[02:29:47.540 --> 02:29:51.860]  because no one's producing we'll be back we're on the March the Empire's on the

[02:33:44.380 --> 02:33:48.700]  you said that was extremely powerful but of course it wasn't on air I told you
[02:33:48.700 --> 02:33:53.820]  please stop crying and it was real so suggest go ahead again and and go back
[02:33:53.820 --> 02:33:56.700]  to that feeling what you just told me that we're going to phone calls okay
[02:33:56.700 --> 02:34:02.700]  Obama phone lady in studio Michelle Dowry from Cleveland Ohio well like like
[02:34:02.700 --> 02:34:08.140]  you were saying Alex to be honest with you my husband and his family had went
[02:34:08.140 --> 02:34:13.420]  to Alabama and by me I've been on in I've been at Cleveland Clinic maybe not
[02:34:13.420 --> 02:34:18.260]  even 90 days so I couldn't take a week off yet I just got my 90 days and I
[02:34:18.260 --> 02:34:22.740]  requested to come to the show by they looking at my Obama phone on the phone
[02:34:22.740 --> 02:34:29.140]  knew I was in line she went on and gave me till next Thursday but as I as I was
[02:34:29.140 --> 02:34:33.980]  saying that I felt some type of way here I am my family's going to Alabama I
[02:34:33.980 --> 02:34:38.100]  never drove and went there I wanted to go but some things you just can't do so I
[02:34:38.100 --> 02:34:41.860]  didn't go I stayed at home but tell the whole story there's like 15 people in a
[02:34:41.860 --> 02:34:45.740]  van going to see the great grandma not exactly what you said earlier okay so
[02:34:45.740 --> 02:34:50.020]  Harvey and his family had went to Alabama they had a van that his sister
[02:34:50.020 --> 02:34:55.020]  bought from an auction like 15 or a couple thousand and it took them all
[02:34:55.020 --> 02:34:59.660]  way there by praying and they made it there and it was like 20 people and what
[02:34:59.660 --> 02:35:05.700]  15 people and 20 people in one van it only holds nine but they put extra so
[02:35:05.700 --> 02:35:09.020]  they rolled to Alabama and I really wanted to go and I couldn't go because I
[02:35:09.020 --> 02:35:14.140]  just got the job make a 50 maybe 15 or 20 hours a week so I said no I ain't
[02:35:14.140 --> 02:35:18.540]  because a big sign to say at my job 90 days before you take off and give a
[02:35:18.540 --> 02:35:22.980]  request you got to get to 90 days or whatever so I didn't go and I was
[02:35:22.980 --> 02:35:27.140]  praying oh god help me I want to go travel I need a break I got like five
[02:35:27.140 --> 02:35:32.340]  kids for four young men's and one daughter 17 year old daughter 12 year old
[02:35:32.340 --> 02:35:40.020]  son 23 25 and 21 and Harvey and my life so I was stressed I wanted to go on a
[02:35:40.020 --> 02:35:47.300]  vacation and I prayed God help me help me God and I got off of work and I got a
[02:35:47.300 --> 02:35:53.420]  phone call we want you back on now I was like see there is a God God yes God
[02:35:53.420 --> 02:36:00.060]  it but listen I'm sure it was God and that's very sweet but but again this is
[02:36:00.060 --> 02:36:04.260]  a mentality across America now and this is a mentality that sociologists have
[02:36:04.260 --> 02:36:09.460]  seen developed in countries where it's socialist where they only give enough
[02:36:09.460 --> 02:36:14.100]  money so you can barely survive and they want people poor under Cloward and
[02:36:14.100 --> 02:36:18.700]  Piven and agenda 21 I can show you all the documents like we should show those
[02:36:18.700 --> 02:36:22.100]  on a big screen later for the film and let her read for herself or they say it
[02:36:22.100 --> 02:36:26.540]  to control you yeah they don't want to give you money early on to build you up
[02:36:26.540 --> 02:36:31.540]  to be successful unless you end up being high level in their system for the
[02:36:31.540 --> 02:36:35.860]  general public they want you at subsistence level to control you and
[02:36:35.860 --> 02:36:39.660]  then you're hoping the lottery ticket or you're hoping the insurance money or
[02:36:39.660 --> 02:36:45.100]  you're hoping zones exactly but but but to me it's very sweet but also very
[02:36:45.100 --> 02:36:49.380]  uncomfortable to feel like people are totally counting on me other than my
[02:36:49.380 --> 02:36:52.980]  family and folks that's why listeners calling and thank me for this and that
[02:36:52.980 --> 02:36:55.740]  I'm like no no I'm just trying to live in a free country don't thank me this is
[02:36:55.740 --> 02:36:59.820]  self-preservation so it's very sweet you're saying that but see in a true
[02:36:59.820 --> 02:37:03.980]  free market society and the type of culture we had even for black folks
[02:37:03.980 --> 02:37:08.100]  under the evils of segregation the aggregate numbers are there that blacks
[02:37:08.100 --> 02:37:12.060]  on average had about three four times the money you do now there was almost no
[02:37:12.060 --> 02:37:16.740]  illegitimacy there was almost no imprisonment in fact black statistically
[02:37:16.740 --> 02:37:20.340]  had a lot of lower crime rates and things than even many white areas that's
[02:37:20.340 --> 02:37:24.460]  all been flipped now right under government so so here's the fact
[02:37:24.460 --> 02:37:29.340]  collectivism and welfare in the great society was created by Lyndon Mains
[02:37:29.340 --> 02:37:35.060]  Johnson and the Ku Klux Klan yeah this is all declassified on record to
[02:37:35.060 --> 02:37:40.540]  annihilate the black community that had been oppressed but it made you stronger
[02:37:40.540 --> 02:37:43.900]  Nietzsche said that which doesn't kill you makes you stronger it's true it did
[02:37:43.900 --> 02:37:47.620]  okay I got beat up a lot when I was a kid I'm meaner in hell the whole point
[02:37:47.620 --> 02:37:52.940]  that's a good thing to be strong so the larger issue is the oppression of blacks
[02:37:52.940 --> 02:37:56.140]  made them own their own businesses their own hotels their own things more suits
[02:37:56.140 --> 02:38:00.740]  and ties and and and be dignified and say we're we're gonna show you how good
[02:38:00.740 --> 02:38:04.700]  we are we don't need you but see the hand shot out from the Ku Klux Klan and
[02:38:04.700 --> 02:38:09.940]  LBJ on record the letters are public and now now now what has big government
[02:38:09.940 --> 02:38:18.500]  done to people period well rollers really now but but see if they had a
[02:38:18.500 --> 02:38:21.460]  gun a white sheet they couldn't sell it Planned Parenthood do you know who
[02:38:21.460 --> 02:38:27.140]  founded that black people Planned Parenthood well it was founded for black
[02:38:27.140 --> 02:38:32.940]  people you're right but not by him all right Planned Parenthood what was was
[02:38:32.940 --> 02:38:38.060]  founded by a lady who got awards from Adolf Hitler oh okay I knew it was a
[02:38:38.060 --> 02:38:41.980]  catch to it because it's you know you can only go in Planned Parenthood if you
[02:38:41.980 --> 02:38:46.660]  low minority right you don't need medical or anything for Planned Parenthood
[02:38:46.660 --> 02:38:50.540]  you just sign your name and they'll help you right yeah and their argument is
[02:38:50.540 --> 02:38:53.740]  there's always poor people let's kill them for their born but they set up a
[02:38:53.740 --> 02:38:59.740]  system to make you poor and to make you destitute right the black people on
[02:38:59.740 --> 02:39:07.820]  average weren't like that 1930-1940 no so they're pretty smart aren't they yeah
[02:39:07.820 --> 02:39:13.020]  they are they call themselves liberal Democrats and they run they run the
[02:39:13.020 --> 02:39:15.580]  country the Republicans basically just work for them
[02:39:15.580 --> 02:39:20.740]  okay okay we'll see back in the day I always thought the Republican did
[02:39:20.740 --> 02:39:25.580]  everything but no they just running to get it get it there and then they're
[02:39:25.580 --> 02:39:30.300]  gone right yes that's what it is just they act like their opposition to the
[02:39:30.300 --> 02:39:35.540]  Democrats right but they just a catch called full spectrum dominance okay you
[02:39:35.540 --> 02:39:38.020]  know what I think while you're here with us the next four days we're gonna show
[02:39:38.020 --> 02:39:44.540]  you the documents and the video on LBJ mm-hmm on everything we're gonna go these
[02:39:44.540 --> 02:39:49.140]  calls we're gonna fill right now but but but specifically give me a give me your
[02:39:49.140 --> 02:39:54.020]  honest response what do you think of what I'm saying here honestly I just think
[02:39:54.020 --> 02:40:00.420]  it was a scam like a scam like like when I did what I did it wasn't for it
[02:40:00.420 --> 02:40:05.020]  wasn't for a bomb it was for Clinton Clinton got us the phones but by me
[02:40:05.020 --> 02:40:10.940]  saying what I said what got the votes and now that it got the votes you're in
[02:40:10.940 --> 02:40:16.620]  president I haven't seen nothing change too much medical couple streets new you
[02:40:16.620 --> 02:40:19.660]  know what about these my niece is numb that still don't get a check in there
[02:40:19.660 --> 02:40:24.340]  baby but the people working in Cleveland paid for those streets right they
[02:40:24.340 --> 02:40:29.340]  paid for those streets but still though I believe that he gave them they open
[02:40:29.340 --> 02:40:33.500]  some doors for more jobs because the streets were raggedy is I don't know
[02:40:33.500 --> 02:40:37.740]  what houses is so many abandoned and now you see the streets are getting a
[02:40:37.740 --> 02:40:43.300]  little bit better you know even myself I got a job now 850 an hour I was working
[02:40:43.300 --> 02:40:48.900]  making $15 I dropped from 15 to 850 I got a job though did you did you last time
[02:40:48.900 --> 02:40:52.300]  you were here you had the maid job and you said you notice that payroll tax
[02:40:52.300 --> 02:40:57.420]  went up that payroll tax I wasn't I was working 40 hours and still getting a
[02:40:57.420 --> 02:41:02.220]  check like a 200 something I wasn't seeing it now I'm working 20 hours I
[02:41:02.220 --> 02:41:06.700]  make a little bit 850 an hour back then I think I was making like 710 so now I'm
[02:41:06.700 --> 02:41:11.460]  making 850 an hour I don't know how you do it I mean medium-grade hard medium-grade
[02:41:11.460 --> 02:41:19.180]  hamburger meats like $10 it's hard it's a struggle it really is and by me
[02:41:19.180 --> 02:41:23.980]  struggling like I've been struggling I even went and applied for better jobs I
[02:41:23.980 --> 02:41:28.100]  don't have any felonies I don't have no no what happened to the house the
[02:41:28.100 --> 02:41:32.140]  condemned house we're able to buy I bought it still got it I bought it me and
[02:41:32.140 --> 02:41:35.340]  Harvey purchased and you're now being able to live in it now I'm able to fix
[02:41:35.340 --> 02:41:38.220]  it up we live first we lived in we couldn't stay in it because we didn't
[02:41:38.220 --> 02:41:41.580]  have the money to fix it because when we bought it you don't see what you buy but
[02:41:41.580 --> 02:41:46.300]  we bought it in needed floors it needed pipes now you don't even use pipes you
[02:41:46.300 --> 02:41:51.500]  just use this plastic stuff red and blue thank God for Harvey diploma because he
[02:41:51.500 --> 02:41:54.300]  fixed it where we could live in it we couldn't pay 600 but I think it's
[02:41:54.300 --> 02:41:57.900]  important for the average person out there to realize how poor folks are
[02:41:57.900 --> 02:42:04.300]  living out there they are really and also living on welfare is where I live
[02:42:04.300 --> 02:42:11.140]  now in Cleveland is the poorest you can get I live right by 55th right where out
[02:42:11.140 --> 02:42:16.620]  of way where all those kids is missing 16 9 year olds they haven't seen
[02:42:16.620 --> 02:42:22.700]  since July 9th no police if it is you got to call them they might come 20 minutes
[02:42:22.700 --> 02:42:27.980]  later it's they didn't kill the person they ran they got away you know crime
[02:42:27.980 --> 02:42:32.140]  rate what do you think of them shipping in millions of illegal aliens with
[02:42:32.140 --> 02:42:39.820]  criminal records I think that sucks too here we is here you talking about you
[02:42:39.820 --> 02:42:44.700]  say what you call them illegals illegals and I was just in jail with them
[02:42:44.700 --> 02:42:49.460]  people they've been in jail over a year no one's seen them but you should sit in
[02:42:49.460 --> 02:42:53.740]  right because you came to our country and you did what you did you don't have a
[02:42:53.740 --> 02:42:57.220]  name like I got a name and they can hold you in jail a year I think that's
[02:42:57.220 --> 02:43:03.220]  illegal but you got to suffer I'm in here and I ain't still in and doing that
[02:43:03.220 --> 02:43:07.860]  and I still got it bad why'd you end up going to jail I went to jail for traffic
[02:43:07.860 --> 02:43:14.340]  a traffic ticket I had since 83 oh I understand the judge told me that the
[02:43:14.340 --> 02:43:18.820]  traffic ticket is now over $2,000 this is 83 I ain't been caught since 83 and
[02:43:18.820 --> 02:43:24.140]  it's 2014 you better throw that out so you got a traffic violation in 83 and
[02:43:24.140 --> 02:43:28.460]  they came with a warrant and grabbed you know I was in the car and they asked me
[02:43:28.460 --> 02:43:32.220]  my name and they took me to jail back to Befford I did the 10 days right now if
[02:43:32.220 --> 02:43:36.300]  you call Befford they'll still tell you all the money and I did 10 days well
[02:43:36.300 --> 02:43:39.580]  that's another thing I noticed the system's so corrupt now they so corrupted
[02:43:39.580 --> 02:43:44.260]  and Cleveland they got a sound there that I grew my five kids up with low my low
[02:43:44.260 --> 02:43:49.020]  back then they had section 8 I live with section 8 to pay 1200 but see if the
[02:43:49.020 --> 02:43:53.460]  government was trying to help a lady who hadn't been in with a law since
[02:43:53.460 --> 02:43:59.220]  1983 and it was for some traffic stuff they would follow the law and say time
[02:43:59.220 --> 02:44:04.460]  served but no see they're gonna keep getting you over and over and oh let's
[02:44:04.460 --> 02:44:08.260]  see I thought the government was gonna help you he helped me yet he helped me
[02:44:08.260 --> 02:44:12.660]  yet and one thing about it is Obama I just knew he was gonna look out for me
[02:44:12.660 --> 02:44:17.060]  my name is Michelle same as your wife I'm right up under you and when she and
[02:44:17.060 --> 02:44:20.820]  our kids look at Michelle Obama they look at Michelle Obama phone lady oh
[02:44:20.820 --> 02:44:23.340]  you're saying on Facebook or something you saw yourself right now about the
[02:44:23.340 --> 02:44:26.020]  internet that's what I told you when I leave the day I want a phone so I can
[02:44:26.020 --> 02:44:29.300]  get on the internet let me tell you how this works they mail people postcards
[02:44:29.300 --> 02:44:33.660]  that donate that say hi I'm Obama I'm your friend and it has a signature and I
[02:44:33.660 --> 02:44:37.340]  talked to Democrats and they go no he knows me he likes me it's all meant to
[02:44:37.340 --> 02:44:41.540]  manipulate nice people like you the Republicans do this too they frame the
[02:44:41.540 --> 02:44:44.660]  Republican cards they get in their house they really believe it was signed by
[02:44:44.660 --> 02:44:48.460]  George W. Bush it's all designed to manipulate sweet people right all
[02:44:48.460 --> 02:44:53.260]  frauds right but nothing was fraud about you I didn't come to see somebody I
[02:44:53.260 --> 02:44:57.180]  came to see Alex Jones the man who sent for me so the same thing with Obama
[02:44:57.180 --> 02:45:00.580]  if Obama would have sent for me I would go to see Obama no I know you want
[02:45:00.580 --> 02:45:06.580]  recognition recognition of what I did I understand all that but but but I don't
[02:45:06.580 --> 02:45:14.060]  say I'm not gonna say like I am gonna say it was bad business that's all bad
[02:45:14.060 --> 02:45:17.980]  business that's just like you Alex Jones if I come to Texas and I put on the
[02:45:17.980 --> 02:45:22.300]  radio I heard the radio station Alex Jones and we're here live in Texas

[02:48:03.660 --> 02:48:07.340]  it sounds like you know a lot more than I do about exactly the type of drugs and
[02:48:07.340 --> 02:48:12.220]  what they do but yeah you know so I was on them for three four months had a
[02:48:12.220 --> 02:48:17.540]  follow-up appointment and prescription refill and they canceled both on me I
[02:48:17.540 --> 02:48:22.060]  went from building up on this medication that's designed to help you feel
[02:48:22.060 --> 02:48:26.420]  better to completely coming off it and I mean I noticed the next few weeks I was
[02:48:26.420 --> 02:48:33.860]  kind of cognizant of the way I was feeling due to that hmm that's how they get you and
[02:48:33.860 --> 02:48:39.020]  for those that don't know for those that don't know it's in the indications on
[02:48:39.020 --> 02:48:43.220]  the serotonin reuptake inhibitors the psychedelics that there's a good
[02:48:43.220 --> 02:48:46.660]  chance you're gonna go completely crazy and jump out of wind or drive crazy or
[02:48:46.660 --> 02:48:51.540]  kill bull if you go off those drugs immediately one thing you don't do is go
[02:48:51.540 --> 02:48:55.060]  off them immediately thank God that didn't happen with you sir but you were
[02:48:55.060 --> 02:48:58.860]  saying the VA just didn't even care put you on them and the took you right off
[02:48:58.860 --> 02:49:02.620]  of them yeah and I didn't even get a I didn't get a follow-up appointment I
[02:49:02.620 --> 02:49:06.180]  mean I have other issues that it's the same kind of deal but I feel like this
[02:49:06.180 --> 02:49:10.020]  one Joe Biggs every week it's called into the VA in Austin and they always
[02:49:10.020 --> 02:49:14.180]  reset him another appointment they don't want to give them that moment they're
[02:49:14.180 --> 02:49:17.580]  just they're gonna wing you up they want it that's a new thing now they want to
[02:49:17.580 --> 02:49:20.900]  wing us off of that because they won't stick he wanted he wants him to stick a
[02:49:20.900 --> 02:49:25.900]  scope down his throat and find out why he's coughing blood up hmm yeah I've
[02:49:25.900 --> 02:49:30.540]  heard I mean his and he's suffered far worse than most and and he served for
[02:49:30.540 --> 02:49:35.140]  that you say he served for the military right he's a VA that's the one of the
[02:49:35.140 --> 02:49:38.620]  absolutely so I'm gonna stop interrupting you go ahead and tell your story yeah
[02:49:38.620 --> 02:49:42.780]  was just one one quick thing so and I'd love to get one of my buddies to get a
[02:49:42.780 --> 02:49:46.900]  recorder in there and get this for you first hand on your way out of the
[02:49:46.900 --> 02:49:50.380]  military they do it the class where you called taps I can't remember what it
[02:49:50.380 --> 02:49:53.980]  stands for but it's basically a transitional program how to help you out
[02:49:53.980 --> 02:49:59.260]  looking for jobs right in the resume and getting your VA benefits so I go in
[02:49:59.260 --> 02:50:03.220]  there and I'm concerned because there's some things wrong with me since I was in
[02:50:03.220 --> 02:50:08.380]  and the guys up there saying hey you can tell me of ringing in your ears there's
[02:50:08.380 --> 02:50:12.420]  no way to prove you can't you can go in there and get tested for sleep apnea and
[02:50:12.420 --> 02:50:17.620]  carpal tunnel and all this stuff that you can't prove just to get a check so it's
[02:50:17.620 --> 02:50:21.700]  bad enough they're doing it to people like Michelle to keep them down but now
[02:50:21.700 --> 02:50:26.100]  they're taking you know guys and gals that at one time had a real fire in their
[02:50:26.100 --> 02:50:30.500]  heart and they're trying to beat them down and make them dependent to and you
[02:50:30.500 --> 02:50:35.820]  know make them dependent on the little measly VA check every month and they're
[02:50:35.820 --> 02:50:40.900]  you know soul source of substance and it's it's ridiculous so Alex I'm gonna
[02:50:40.900 --> 02:50:44.620]  see if I can get one of my buddies on the way out to go in and record this stuff
[02:50:44.620 --> 02:50:49.980]  before he can get it to you incredible I go ahead when I got up in the last when

[02:55:44.580 --> 02:55:47.900]  now told me they are we're talking about that in the next hour after calls for
[02:55:47.900 --> 02:55:51.020]  going public and speaking out against Obama when you were here last year and
[02:55:51.020 --> 02:55:56.580]  those are kind of scared to do it now that I'm saying they wanted to kill you
[02:55:56.580 --> 02:56:00.300]  in the womb but because they couldn't kill you in the womb they've tried to
[02:56:00.300 --> 02:56:05.180]  kill your dreams kill your future kill your education to where all you know is
[02:56:05.180 --> 02:56:09.940]  trying to navigate their system for crumbs when I guarantee you if you were
[02:56:09.940 --> 02:56:13.500]  given a business I've been down to the Caribbean you go to places that are free
[02:56:13.500 --> 02:56:17.860]  market where the people own their own businesses that are native to there that
[02:56:17.860 --> 02:56:21.860]  were brought there as slaves to be sugarcane plantation people that they're
[02:56:21.860 --> 02:56:26.860]  just like an entrepreneur the executive white person or Hispanic or somebody
[02:56:26.860 --> 02:56:31.940]  that owns a business they're just as slick just as smart just as happy just as
[02:56:31.940 --> 02:56:36.700]  affluent just as fun to hang out with you take black Americans especially that
[02:56:36.700 --> 02:56:41.940]  are put in this welfare system it absolutely destroys people and that's
[02:56:41.940 --> 02:56:46.940]  what I'm just being point blank with you and so the reason I'm talking about all
[02:56:46.940 --> 02:56:51.620]  this is to point out that this is bondage I mean do you agree with me that
[02:56:51.620 --> 02:56:56.420]  this welfare system and this government culture is a new form of slavery yes I
[02:56:56.420 --> 02:57:01.340]  really do agree because back in the day it wasn't like this I wanted examples I
[02:57:01.340 --> 02:57:06.060]  got a 25 he's a VA social worker like we were talking he's a VA social worker I
[02:57:06.060 --> 02:57:13.380]  sent him to college he went to Hiram one thing about it is I gotta check I got
[02:57:13.380 --> 02:57:19.260]  food stamps I had the rent assistance my rent was 1200 I didn't pay a dime they
[02:57:19.260 --> 02:57:25.380]  gave me 200 every month that was the old system the old system that was before a
[02:57:25.380 --> 02:57:30.660]  bomb even got in I was on section 8 1200 a month for rent I didn't pay a dime
[02:57:30.660 --> 02:57:34.820]  plus they gave me 200 to pay my lighting gas this was five kids but don't you see
[02:57:34.820 --> 02:57:40.300]  that they can only take it all away with a black president imagine if a white
[02:57:40.300 --> 02:57:45.860]  president was doing that hey you know I hate to say this
[02:57:46.420 --> 02:57:51.580]  go ahead and say it don't be afraid when I was standing there with a run of me
[02:57:51.580 --> 02:57:56.900]  and illiterate I'm admitting that I was illiterate because I didn't know no
[02:57:56.900 --> 02:58:01.820]  better they they will like a fishing rod they real you in because when I was
[02:58:01.820 --> 02:58:06.780]  protesting for a bomber and making the $15 the other side over there with a
[02:58:06.780 --> 02:58:11.220]  run of me they were at $20 see what I'm saying then a run of me I told them
[02:58:11.220 --> 02:58:17.300]  people what he was gonna do I don't know what he told them but when a run of me
[02:58:17.300 --> 02:58:22.220]  pulled up I was against a run of me because I had listened to what Obama
[02:58:22.220 --> 02:58:26.860]  said and this is who I was working for they went and got all of us people that
[02:58:26.860 --> 02:58:31.460]  were on welfare didn't have no job no felons you can get a job I could take

[03:01:36.140 --> 03:01:40.940]  medically retired what happens to a lot of people they say just forget it just
[03:01:40.940 --> 03:01:46.060]  let me out let me out and you know they they go without then for the rest of their
[03:01:46.060 --> 03:01:51.020]  lives or something that they sacrificed a lot for and it's just it's just messed
[03:01:51.020 --> 03:01:57.140]  up that they're trying to make you know I guess welfare recipients out of you
[03:01:57.140 --> 03:02:02.100]  know guys and gals that have sacrificed and like I said at one time really had a
[03:02:02.100 --> 03:02:06.700]  burning fire and wanted to make a difference and as people wake up you know
[03:02:06.700 --> 03:02:11.180]  it's upsetting when you've gone and you've put your life on the line to find
[03:02:11.180 --> 03:02:15.900]  out what was it really for what are what are we fighting for well I totally
[03:02:15.900 --> 03:02:19.700]  agree with you and again it's not welfare to give medical treatment to the
[03:02:19.700 --> 03:02:23.300]  military they have a lot of the money you're supposed to take care of the
[03:02:23.300 --> 03:02:27.140]  veterans they steal it they siphon it off into the bureaucracy and that's come
[03:02:27.140 --> 03:02:32.420]  out and now under Obama every veteran I've talked to says the VA is many times
[03:02:32.420 --> 03:02:37.220]  worse than it was just six seven years ago and they've got secret death list
[03:02:37.220 --> 03:02:41.500]  which they're gonna move into every level and just not give you care when
[03:02:41.500 --> 03:02:45.900]  you're old tax you your whole life right and then oh we're gonna put you on a
[03:02:45.900 --> 03:02:49.460]  death panel list because you're 65 years old you're not gonna get a knee
[03:02:49.460 --> 03:02:53.140]  surgery you're too old we're gonna give that to young people which then sells
[03:02:53.140 --> 03:02:58.980]  the young on the idea of you make the pie smaller or the pie doesn't get bigger
[03:02:58.980 --> 03:03:03.540]  it's just a hard collectivism is horrible because it puts other people in
[03:03:03.540 --> 03:03:07.420]  control of your lives Phil thank you Tyler in Oklahoma thanks for holding
[03:03:07.420 --> 03:03:13.860]  you're on the year go ahead hello sir thank you for taking my call I wanted to
[03:03:13.860 --> 03:03:18.660]  talk to you about a solution for the border problem opportunity and disguise
[03:03:18.660 --> 03:03:23.220]  that we have go ahead I used to live I used to live near the border in Las
[03:03:23.220 --> 03:03:29.860]  Cruces in Mexico and people have no idea the savagery that is going on there and
[03:03:29.860 --> 03:03:35.260]  people want to blame be mad split the left right paradigm of it's mad at the
[03:03:35.260 --> 03:03:39.100]  immigrants that are coming here well I've been to Mexico spent time in water as
[03:03:39.100 --> 03:03:43.860]  a Mexico City and I wouldn't want to live there either so a good solution now
[03:03:43.860 --> 03:03:47.420]  wait a minute there's nothing wrong with Mexico Robert Rodriguez made a movie
[03:03:47.420 --> 03:03:52.620]  where Don Johnson shoots pregnant Mexican women I mean isn't it guys and
[03:03:52.620 --> 03:03:56.900]  cowboys heads fault no no no no no everything is the fault of Don Johnson
[03:03:56.900 --> 03:04:03.020]  sorry go ahead we all have the right to self-defense my point was the solution
[03:04:03.020 --> 03:04:07.700]  that I have come up with that I've been taking up for a while is we need male
[03:04:07.700 --> 03:04:14.820]  heroes we need people to look at men to turn this turn this around we don't have
[03:04:14.820 --> 03:04:21.060]  any men to look up to kids coming from single-family homes we need men to help
[03:04:21.060 --> 03:04:28.340]  Mexico become a place where Mexicans want to live again whether oh well I
[03:04:28.340 --> 03:04:32.460]  agree with you but they have a name for that that's called terrorism you see
[03:04:32.460 --> 03:04:36.980]  Mexico has a big strong government but they're it's corrupt so what it's got
[03:04:36.980 --> 03:04:41.700]  is they'll have a man who aren't real men who have taught people that gangster
[03:04:41.700 --> 03:04:46.820]  terrorism is what creates power and being under a chief is what makes you
[03:04:46.820 --> 03:04:51.180]  successful and no it creates a failed civilization and we're following that
[03:04:51.180 --> 03:04:55.820]  direction as well great points Tyler we need they do have real men the farmers

[03:08:36.460 --> 03:08:43.060]  resuscitate dying border bill which is an open border bill they all pass this
[03:08:43.060 --> 03:08:46.860]  it'll fix the problem that we're dictators and have opened the border up
[03:08:46.860 --> 03:08:52.140]  it's not a problem they're doing it in the speakers lobby just off the house
[03:08:52.140 --> 03:09:00.460]  floor members of Congress were full of recriminations over how the border bill
[03:09:00.460 --> 03:09:07.340]  had just died until it sparked back to life you know that's that's that's that's
[03:09:07.340 --> 03:09:12.900]  how the elite sneak stuff through they let opposition build as William Gean
[03:09:12.900 --> 03:09:17.100]  said here just a few days ago and then they kill it and then they bring it back
[03:09:17.100 --> 03:09:21.740]  House leadership has announced a 3 p.m. special conference meeting to discuss the
[03:09:21.740 --> 03:09:24.980]  issue and raise the possibility of additional votes for the House departs
[03:09:24.980 --> 03:09:29.820]  for summer recess the changes and abrupt shift from a decision to pull the
[03:09:29.820 --> 03:09:33.460]  bill and leave without a vote on it at all according to Republicans familiar
[03:09:33.460 --> 03:09:36.780]  with the matter the decision prompted a sudden and fierce backlash against
[03:09:36.780 --> 03:09:40.900]  speaker John Boehner from rank and file see a lot of Marty took off early folks
[03:09:40.900 --> 03:09:46.100]  he is so sneaky and and file members who wanted to be able to tout passage of a
[03:09:46.100 --> 03:09:51.180]  bill to constituent some of the summer break and the media think knows the
[03:09:51.180 --> 03:09:55.380]  public's not paying attention they're like we got to get something done we don't
[03:09:55.380 --> 03:09:59.380]  like gridlock we need to do something about the kids pouring across and the
[03:09:59.380 --> 03:10:04.860]  adults this bill will fix it won't it'll fix it's like if one arm's cut off cut
[03:10:04.860 --> 03:10:08.460]  the other arm off that's how you stop bleeding I guess it will slow bleeding
[03:10:08.460 --> 03:10:13.380]  in the other arm because you'll bleed out of the you know the second arm but
[03:10:13.380 --> 03:10:18.660]  overall blood flow will be more intense you cut this arm off it said a hundred
[03:10:18.660 --> 03:10:21.420]  percent bleed and you cut the other one off it goes down to seventy five percent
[03:10:21.420 --> 03:10:26.780]  but this one's still bleeding and they just play games and the games are so
[03:10:26.780 --> 03:10:30.860]  simple I don't know how the public doesn't understand it we're gonna bring
[03:10:30.860 --> 03:10:34.340]  her back in and get her hooked back up to her earpiece but let's go to Michael
[03:10:34.340 --> 03:10:37.780]  in South Carolina you're on the air thanks for calling in and thanks for
[03:10:37.780 --> 03:10:44.820]  holding hi Alex hi go ahead Alex I read none dare call a conspiracy 32 years
[03:10:44.820 --> 03:10:52.500]  ago and I was awestruck but I kind of succumbed to the cognitive dissidents and
[03:10:52.500 --> 03:11:00.300]  I just thought it was so overpowering that you had to believe almost at that
[03:11:00.300 --> 03:11:03.740]  time that that these people would be benevolent that they were the best in
[03:11:03.740 --> 03:11:07.780]  the brightest and then Ron Paul woke me up about 20 years ago and I've been
[03:11:07.780 --> 03:11:14.260]  following you for about 15 years but now that the cognitive dissidents in the
[03:11:14.260 --> 03:11:20.780]  in the general public has just completely corroded society I was in a
[03:11:20.780 --> 03:11:25.180]  business that with contemporaries that we're making over a hundred thousand
[03:11:25.180 --> 03:11:31.420]  dollars and now probably 40% of those people are retired and getting you know
[03:11:31.420 --> 03:11:38.980]  wangling disability their their honor has been compromised and that's what I
[03:11:38.980 --> 03:11:43.300]  see happening all over the country is that it you know honorable people are
[03:11:43.300 --> 03:11:48.540]  compromised by the situations and they're being replaced by people that are
[03:11:48.540 --> 03:11:57.020]  MBAs that'll come out and work for $40,000 a year I know and and it's not
[03:11:57.020 --> 03:12:01.140]  just the elite that are now corrupt and weird it's that more and more of the
[03:12:01.140 --> 03:12:07.420]  general public just has no soul no morals and you have to just search for
[03:12:07.420 --> 03:12:12.220]  good people and search for people that that don't want to betray you for no
[03:12:12.220 --> 03:12:18.620]  reason I mean people will betray you even when it hurts them and there's no
[03:12:18.620 --> 03:12:24.860]  reason to it's just they do bad even though it's not even good business for
[03:12:24.860 --> 03:12:31.700]  them to do it it's incredible you know you're trying to restore honor in this
[03:12:31.700 --> 03:12:36.260]  country I just don't know if there's enough people that are susceptible to
[03:12:36.260 --> 03:12:40.100]  your message anymore and I don't want to sound defeatist because I won't give up
[03:12:40.100 --> 03:12:45.380]  but it's very disheartening you know I called in because I just saw an
[03:12:45.380 --> 03:12:50.740]  article of newsflash in the Washington Post where Brennan admitted that the CIA
[03:12:50.740 --> 03:12:55.140]  had been spying on the senator the Senate computers oh yeah and first they
[03:12:55.140 --> 03:12:59.380]  denied that I have the article right here see I admits improperly hacking
[03:12:59.380 --> 03:13:03.300]  Senate computers to control the Senate Intelligence Committee that's supposed to
[03:13:03.300 --> 03:13:07.300]  control them and that's what all these people need to get like Diane Feinstein
[03:13:07.300 --> 03:13:12.060]  and others is they'll never escape the tyranny they've helped build I mean who
[03:13:12.060 --> 03:13:16.420]  would want to build something this dangerous and evil I mean it's beyond
[03:13:16.420 --> 03:13:20.060]  nuclear weapons because yeah why do you make nuclear weapons well because the
[03:13:20.060 --> 03:13:24.660]  Russians might get them okay well then why do you build giant NSA systems oh
[03:13:24.660 --> 03:13:29.980]  to keep us safe but it's not it's for political control and then people then
[03:13:29.980 --> 03:13:34.980]  convince themselves of any reason to keep going along with the system and
[03:13:34.980 --> 03:13:38.220]  again we don't need to wait during the break she can come in and get hooked up
[03:13:38.220 --> 03:13:42.940]  just whenever she's writing in here okay thank you Michael really great call
[03:13:42.940 --> 03:13:47.700]  let's talk to Joel in Texas Joel you're on the air yes sir Alex I was
[03:13:47.700 --> 03:13:50.940]  curious about you know Obama tells us the reason he's bringing in all these
[03:13:50.940 --> 03:13:54.540]  illegal alien children from Central America well he loves them but it's
[03:13:54.540 --> 03:13:58.100]  because they've grown up in war-torn areas and subjected to gang violence now
[03:13:58.100 --> 03:14:02.220]  what about the kids growing up in war-torn gang infested areas like
[03:14:02.220 --> 03:14:07.020]  Detroit LA Chicago Miami we're gonna round them up too I mean why can't they
[03:14:07.020 --> 03:14:10.620]  not up and just tell us the truth man it's about power control collapse in the
[03:14:10.620 --> 03:14:14.180]  country well I mean they don't tell the truth even when the truth would serve
[03:14:14.180 --> 03:14:18.220]  them best because that's their nature but yes there's only one place in the
[03:14:18.220 --> 03:14:24.780]  United States more dangerous than Mexico per capita that's Chicago then
[03:14:24.780 --> 03:14:29.820]  there's one other sector that's almost as bad as Mexico that's Detroit but
[03:14:29.820 --> 03:14:35.860]  Detroit has guns so that's why they've had so many robbers shot and killed that
[03:14:35.860 --> 03:14:39.820]  that their crime rates actually been dropping the police chief said just
[03:14:39.820 --> 03:14:44.820]  last week thanks to citizen shooting criminals and again I've got to say the
[03:14:44.820 --> 03:14:48.900]  head of Interpol came out last year and said arm the general public that will
[03:14:48.900 --> 03:14:54.740]  end you know Muslim radical Muslim attacks in Europe and Africa and we've
[03:14:54.740 --> 03:15:00.220]  got the police chief of Detroit Sam get guns now we can't protect you they've
[03:15:00.220 --> 03:15:05.100]  cut the police and you you need to get guns I mean that's normal when you're
[03:15:05.100 --> 03:15:11.180]  in a road warrior situation to have the police chief say get guns and I mean the
[03:15:11.180 --> 03:15:15.380]  awesome police chief knows full well more guns means less crime criminals are
[03:15:15.380 --> 03:15:19.420]  gonna have guns regardless they they know that I mentioned the heroes of
[03:15:19.420 --> 03:15:25.620]  Mexico they act just like Texans because they are I mean you know Mexico was
[03:15:25.620 --> 03:15:30.140]  founded a third of the people here were were were to Hano you know Mexicans the
[03:15:30.140 --> 03:15:33.660]  guy that wrote the Constitution had been a Mexican they didn't like Santa Ana
[03:15:33.660 --> 03:15:39.820]  Mexico later overthrew Santa Ana after he lost Texas because he was a thug I
[03:15:39.820 --> 03:15:44.860]  mean no one wanted no one wanted to be under Santa Ana and the Texans didn't
[03:15:44.860 --> 03:15:48.580]  want to have a fight with him but he came and said I'm taking the land that the
[03:15:48.580 --> 03:15:53.140]  previous president sold you for pennies on the dollar is a couple cents an acre
[03:15:53.140 --> 03:15:57.220]  we paid three cents an acre from the previous Mexican government before Santa
[03:15:57.220 --> 03:16:01.260]  Ana they all spent it like it was a bunch of Don Johnson's shooting pregnant
[03:16:01.260 --> 03:16:06.180]  women in the Mexican Revolution that started here in Texas became the
[03:16:06.180 --> 03:16:09.860]  Texas Revolution there were a bunch of other Mexican revolutions against
[03:16:09.860 --> 03:16:18.580]  tyrants Guatemala took Guatemala from Santa Ana because he was a dictator I
[03:16:18.580 --> 03:16:22.420]  mean does that mean they didn't like Hispanics no they didn't like Santa Ana
[03:16:22.420 --> 03:16:28.780]  see I know too much I know history I'm not an ignorant fool but the system knows
[03:16:28.780 --> 03:16:34.260]  the average person doesn't know all this information and doesn't know Santa Ana
[03:16:34.260 --> 03:16:38.580]  said I'm coming to take all your guns and in Texas was very dangerous at that
[03:16:38.580 --> 03:16:43.860]  time with Comanche you name it in big Indian Wars and they said we can't give
[03:16:43.860 --> 03:16:47.740]  up our guns we're not giving up our property that's what happened there but
[03:16:47.740 --> 03:16:54.180]  in Mexico the last five years they've had rural ranchers the cowboy hats the
[03:16:54.180 --> 03:16:58.140]  whole nine yards to get illegal guns out of the US and start fighting back
[03:16:58.140 --> 03:17:02.180]  against the cartels and the cartels have now left those areas and the Mexican
[03:17:02.180 --> 03:17:05.740]  armies pulled out of those areas and crime rates have plummeted that's
[03:17:05.740 --> 03:17:11.740]  mainstream niche see there's the answer let's go ahead and talk to Dr. McCoy
[03:17:11.740 --> 03:17:17.580]  great points Joel Dr. McCoy go ahead thanks I think that there may be a
[03:17:17.580 --> 03:17:21.860]  non-prescription treatment for the Ebola virus hidden in the technical
[03:17:21.860 --> 03:17:27.380]  literature the name of the compound is Polly I see that's PLY parenthesis I
[03:17:27.380 --> 03:17:33.820]  colon C closed parenthesis and this is basically a long generic double stranded
[03:17:33.820 --> 03:17:38.700]  RNA that is an immuno modulator you can look that up on Wikipedia and it'll
[03:17:38.700 --> 03:17:44.980]  give you a little overview if you want I can back this up with an article from
[03:17:44.980 --> 03:17:50.500]  the proceedings of National Academy of Sciences the title is a non replicating
[03:17:50.500 --> 03:17:58.900]  subunit vaccine protects mice against lethal Ebola challenge excuse me and in
[03:17:58.900 --> 03:18:04.500]  that they called an adjuvant suggesting that it's aiding the vaccine but in
[03:18:04.500 --> 03:18:11.140]  fact there's a patent application I believe from Novartis which seems to be
[03:18:11.140 --> 03:18:16.140]  disclosing that this can act on its own this is marketed as a animal antibiotic
[03:18:16.140 --> 03:18:22.860]  but it's not an antibiotic again it's an immuno modulator and it can be found on
[03:18:22.860 --> 03:18:29.460]  the open market I can give you the name of that patent application if you want well
[03:18:29.460 --> 03:18:32.780]  that's very interesting sir you should write an article about it for us and then
[03:18:32.780 --> 03:18:36.460]  we'll fact check it and put it up on info wars comm anybody can submit
[03:18:36.460 --> 03:18:40.860]  articles at planet info wars comm it's primitive and simple but it works well
[03:18:40.860 --> 03:18:45.780]  that's our little social network planet info wars comm thank you so much for the
[03:18:45.780 --> 03:18:49.900]  call and I wasn't ignoring you there at the end Obama phone lady came back in
[03:18:49.900 --> 03:18:53.580]  and I put you on pause for like five seconds I missed the end of what you
[03:18:53.580 --> 03:18:56.980]  were saying occasionally if it sounds like I wouldn't listen to you it's
[03:18:56.980 --> 03:19:00.700]  because they're popping in my ear to say just even tour I just want his lawsuit
[03:19:00.700 --> 03:19:05.580]  or you know blah blah blah by the way I've talked to Ventura I've been playing
[03:19:05.580 --> 03:19:10.540]  phone tag within the last few days I'm just gonna get him on for a full hour
[03:19:10.540 --> 03:19:16.020]  next week he wasn't gonna do any news but he did a couple TVs he because he's
[03:19:16.020 --> 03:19:21.700]  playing a 3m charity deal the next three days a big golf tournament and so it was
[03:19:21.700 --> 03:19:25.460]  like either get him on for like 10 minutes via scratchy cell phone or try to
[03:19:25.460 --> 03:19:29.380]  get him on via Skype or something next week we've got to help him fix his Skype
[03:19:29.380 --> 03:19:34.060]  at his house and he said he'd he'd do it his wife said he'd do it so we'll get a
[03:19:34.060 --> 03:19:37.700]  response from Ventura and give all this big world news going on the Ventura
[03:19:37.700 --> 03:19:42.500]  thing's not really important we're gonna skip this network break gosh but the
[03:19:42.500 --> 03:19:47.020]  larger issue is they could destroy
[03:19:47.180 --> 03:19:51.060]  anybody with one of these hoaxes and it's not about Chris Kyle in the service
[03:19:51.060 --> 03:19:56.700]  it's not about his wife the widow as they made it to media Chris Kyle said
[03:19:56.700 --> 03:20:01.020]  he beat up Jesse Ventura in front of people for saying that he was glad Navy
[03:20:01.020 --> 03:20:07.420]  Seals were dying Jesse Ventura never talked like that and he said retract it
[03:20:07.420 --> 03:20:11.620]  and they wouldn't he filed suit on Chris Kyle Chris Kyle then got killed
[03:20:11.620 --> 03:20:17.380]  mysteriously and now they're spinning in the media or they repeat what Chris
[03:20:17.380 --> 03:20:22.180]  Kyle said and then they say and Jesse Ventura sued and beat his wife he ganged
[03:20:22.180 --> 03:20:27.220]  up on a woman news core published that book and undoubtedly wrote it and ghost
[03:20:27.220 --> 03:20:32.740]  wrote it for him and basically did that news cores insurance paid the 1.8
[03:20:32.740 --> 03:20:36.980]  million not Chris Kyle's wife and now Clint Eastwood's making his book into a
[03:20:36.980 --> 03:20:43.100]  movie maybe it'll have Jesse Ventura getting punched out in it I bet it won't
[03:20:43.100 --> 03:20:47.100]  now that he won't have lawsuit it will have Clint Eastwood punch him on I like
[03:20:47.100 --> 03:20:51.460]  Clint Eastwood maybe we'll have Jesse Ventura somebody'll say he cooked up you
[03:20:51.460 --> 03:20:54.380]  know methamphetamine with him or something it's not true and Ventura is
[03:20:54.380 --> 03:20:59.300]  not supposed to sue let's say they said Jesse Ventura murdered an innocent
[03:20:59.300 --> 03:21:05.940]  person and then Jesse Ventura sues the person that says it they die and then he
[03:21:05.940 --> 03:21:10.380]  wins a suit against the book they wrote that the wife now owns the book I mean
[03:21:10.380 --> 03:21:16.060]  do you have a right to justice in this country and I get the fact that Chris
[03:21:16.060 --> 03:21:20.620]  Kyle seen as a Republican and so the Obama hatred is so intense right now
[03:21:20.620 --> 03:21:24.620]  and look I'm not defending Ventura because I've known him for about nine
[03:21:24.620 --> 03:21:31.580]  years and we're friends I'm defending him because he didn't do that they made it
[03:21:31.580 --> 03:21:36.620]  up they claimed he got an altercation with cops in LA at an airport and ran
[03:21:36.620 --> 03:21:41.660]  from police basically in a car and he was in a golf tournament in Minnesota and
[03:21:41.660 --> 03:21:46.700]  hadn't flown for two years when that happened they were running Psyops on him
[03:21:46.700 --> 03:21:52.780]  and they could do it to me or Matt Drudge or Ron Paul or Rand Paul and I'm
[03:21:52.780 --> 03:21:56.620]  gonna give people the benefit of the doubt when they've been set up by a
[03:21:56.620 --> 03:22:00.260]  system I know a hit piece when I see it and I think Chris Kyle was manipulated
[03:22:00.260 --> 03:22:04.420]  I think he was told to say that
[03:22:05.540 --> 03:22:09.500]  and he was set up and I don't think he got killed probably over the Ventura
[03:22:09.500 --> 03:22:12.620]  thing definitely a set up when he got killed my heart goes out to his wife
[03:22:12.620 --> 03:22:18.260]  that's the bigger issue when he got executed at that gun range in Dallas it
[03:22:18.260 --> 03:22:24.580]  it the craft international that he owns wears the Punisher with an added symbol
[03:22:24.580 --> 03:22:32.260]  and khaki pants and those guys at the Boston bombing were wearing craft
[03:22:32.260 --> 03:22:38.740]  international outfits khaki pants black shirts Punisher emblem and craft would
[03:22:38.740 --> 03:22:42.700]  not respond and not say they hadn't done it and Chris Kyle died right after that
[03:22:42.700 --> 03:22:47.980]  I mean right after and I'm not saying craft was involved we watched the video
[03:22:47.980 --> 03:22:50.740]  on the photos when that went off they were running around checking everybody
[03:22:50.740 --> 03:22:57.660]  they had I believe craft for someone like them in a drill that they because
[03:22:57.660 --> 03:23:00.100]  they'll because they'll get a bunch of drill we know a drill was going on to
[03:23:00.100 --> 03:23:04.220]  show that cops if they find the real bomb with another group they'll just
[03:23:04.220 --> 03:23:08.020]  think it's part of the drill we've talked a lot about that so I believe Chris
[03:23:08.020 --> 03:23:12.620]  Kyle got executed and they set up some mind control victim to take the fall
[03:23:12.620 --> 03:23:19.740]  because he knew too much and I think was probably overall a good guy he was
[03:23:19.740 --> 03:23:23.540]  obviously being directed by high-level people as a cutout asset and they
[03:23:23.540 --> 03:23:29.700]  burned him now folks I was told by Navy SEALs a week after 20 something of them
[03:23:29.700 --> 03:23:33.300]  died in that helicopter crash that the word was there was a bomb on board and
[03:23:33.300 --> 03:23:36.380]  that they thought they'd been set up and killed because the bin Laden raid was
[03:23:36.380 --> 03:23:42.060]  fake and that they killed the body double years after that I've had multiple
[03:23:42.060 --> 03:23:46.260]  Navy SEALs and multiple Navy SEAL families on who lost family and they
[03:23:46.260 --> 03:23:50.780]  say that's the word and they know the name of the body double and let me tell
[03:23:50.780 --> 03:23:55.620]  you when I meet with a Navy SEAL or meet with a Navy SEALs family and private
[03:23:55.620 --> 03:23:59.780]  early on it was dangerous when I went on air with that information so let me
[03:23:59.780 --> 03:24:05.420]  explain something I'm not up here making this stuff up okay I mean I get
[03:24:05.420 --> 03:24:11.500]  chills folks a fear and I'm not even consciously afraid my body is afraid
[03:24:11.500 --> 03:24:19.780]  my you understand what I'm saying I'm a body my body is afraid whenever we
[03:24:19.780 --> 03:24:25.660]  confirm this is above my pay grade folks that they took a bunch of nuclear
[03:24:25.660 --> 03:24:33.060]  weapons that were hidden at Dias out and and send them to the East Coast and
[03:24:33.060 --> 03:24:36.100]  then Obama starts talking about I'm afraid nukes will go off with some
[03:24:36.100 --> 03:24:45.180]  mystery group I mean the globalists are not above false flagging and then you
[03:24:45.180 --> 03:24:48.580]  know who they're gonna come after they're gonna come after the libertarian
[03:24:48.580 --> 03:24:52.620]  movement folks and believe me I'm a canary in the coal mine they ever
[03:24:52.620 --> 03:24:55.580]  announced Alex Jones is committed suicide or Alex Jones is found dead with an
[03:24:55.580 --> 03:25:00.220]  eagle on his arm I was killed I will never commit suicide and I don't use
[03:25:00.220 --> 03:25:04.140]  illegal drugs ladies and gentlemen I don't use pharmaceuticals they say he had
[03:25:04.140 --> 03:25:08.740]  a thing of sleeping pills his belly I've never taken a sleeping pill I've had a
[03:25:08.740 --> 03:25:13.220]  broken leg and I won't take the painkillers make me vomit everywhere so I
[03:25:13.220 --> 03:25:19.180]  want that on record ladies and gentlemen they took secret nuclear weapons out of
[03:25:19.180 --> 03:25:24.740]  Dias Air Force Base in West Texas they blew up that helicopter to kill those
[03:25:24.740 --> 03:25:29.060]  Navy SEALs because they were talking you think I like knowing that info I was
[03:25:29.060 --> 03:25:33.740]  real happy when that got broken years a year later on you know mainstream news
[03:25:33.740 --> 03:25:37.060]  they were saying that because you know what that means that means I'm not top
[03:25:37.060 --> 03:25:41.380]  of the list to get killed I don't want to be the hero I don't want to be out
[03:25:41.380 --> 03:25:46.060]  front I don't want the accolades I don't want to do this job okay I have a
[03:25:46.060 --> 03:25:51.140]  responsibility to tell the truth because my bones won't let me do anything
[03:25:51.140 --> 03:25:56.300]  else that Obama phone lady back with us you just said amen we'll turn her mic
[03:25:56.300 --> 03:26:00.020]  back on what do you think of what I just said that's true too you got to do

[03:28:30.580 --> 03:28:36.300]  golden interview I'm so glad that you extended it you bought the mind before I
[03:28:36.300 --> 03:28:40.500]  get to the two quick questions from this party when you mentioned craft
[03:28:40.500 --> 03:28:45.820]  services I'm half German I don't know if you know that craft in German means
[03:28:45.820 --> 03:28:52.780]  force I don't know if what the origins of the naming of that company was but
[03:28:52.780 --> 03:29:00.420]  pretty odd in German it would be force services and it seems to be that that's
[03:29:00.420 --> 03:29:04.500]  what it's allowing to that that's exactly what they are and that's what

[03:33:18.940 --> 03:33:24.500]  I don't gamble in the rig casinos I don't gamble in the rig political system I
[03:33:24.500 --> 03:33:29.820]  create my own system outside of their system because the truth is there's a
[03:33:29.820 --> 03:33:34.220]  whole universe around us and the lie is the Democrats and Republicans control
[03:33:34.220 --> 03:33:40.820]  reality that the Labor and Tories control reality in Britain in the UK you've
[03:33:40.820 --> 03:33:44.980]  got to understand they've created artificial system for us they live we
[03:33:44.980 --> 03:33:49.980]  sleep they are outside the system finishing up with Tom and Marilyn what
[03:33:49.980 --> 03:33:53.620]  is your specific question for Obama phone lady we never played the famous
[03:33:53.620 --> 03:33:57.060]  Obama phone clip we even have it in HD from a guy that shot it we should
[03:33:57.060 --> 03:34:00.700]  probably get that for tomorrow from McBreen and have it but perhaps we'll
[03:34:00.700 --> 03:34:04.580]  end with that in a few minutes so we'll get that queued up but sir I mean what's
[03:34:04.580 --> 03:34:09.980]  your specific question Tom I was curious about whether or not anything other than
[03:34:09.980 --> 03:34:16.380]  promises were made in order to try to get people to their side be it in cash
[03:34:16.380 --> 03:34:22.580]  or be it in gifts but the most important question and I think the one that
[03:34:22.580 --> 03:34:27.860]  really is most apropos and I think what you were trying to get to Mr. Jones in
[03:34:27.860 --> 03:34:35.500]  speaking with Ms. Dardi is this very simple in the story as far as your view
[03:34:35.500 --> 03:34:41.740]  is concerned and I'm very interested in this when it comes to the best
[03:34:41.740 --> 03:34:48.260]  government do you feel that the best government it would be one that provides
[03:34:48.260 --> 03:34:58.340]  for the people by giving them things by money gifts and other things such as
[03:34:58.340 --> 03:35:03.580]  housing vouchers or do you think that the best government would be one that
[03:35:03.580 --> 03:35:10.620]  provides and I put that in quotations a way for people to make their own way in
[03:35:10.620 --> 03:35:17.740]  the world by getting out of their lives and allowing people to actually live
[03:35:17.740 --> 03:35:23.020]  without big government on this yeah that's it I mean the collectivist model
[03:35:23.020 --> 03:35:30.660]  is proven that it wrecks society the free market society builds builds
[03:35:30.660 --> 03:35:36.060]  prosperity builds men and women it was Victor Hugo who said adversity builds
[03:35:36.060 --> 03:35:40.940]  men a prosperity builds monsters I mean it's like your kids right rich people's
[03:35:40.940 --> 03:35:44.460]  kids just get more and more spoiled because they're given everything right
[03:35:44.460 --> 03:35:48.140]  well poor people if they're given everything it's even more evil because
[03:35:48.140 --> 03:35:52.620]  they're only given enough to never think there's something outside of it and
[03:35:52.620 --> 03:35:57.380]  then it creates mediocrity a lot of mess just so what type of society do you
[03:35:57.380 --> 03:36:03.620]  want what kind of I would like this society to be where people that can't
[03:36:03.620 --> 03:36:08.500]  make it they could get a check they can get food stamps and even housing if you
[03:36:08.500 --> 03:36:12.580]  got enough little money what he's saying is the system's been designed to take
[03:36:12.580 --> 03:36:17.220]  jobs away from you they're $30 an hour right and to devalue the dollar where
[03:36:17.220 --> 03:36:21.740]  with your $10 an hour you can't make it to force you on to welfare because they
[03:36:21.740 --> 03:36:25.860]  have giant automated robot systems coming out that will produce bobbles and
[03:36:25.860 --> 03:36:32.580]  low-grade food for you to fully domesticate you for a future assimilation
[03:36:32.580 --> 03:36:39.700]  post-human era of the technotronic age mm-hmm what do I think about what does
[03:36:39.700 --> 03:36:44.260]  that sound like what I just said fucks it's as if an alien force had come to
[03:36:44.260 --> 03:36:49.220]  earth and was running a algorithm takeover program mm-hmm you understand
[03:36:49.220 --> 03:36:53.660]  mm-hmm and then we understand those of us that are outside of that and see the
[03:36:53.660 --> 03:36:57.860]  enemy operation that it's gonna come for us next right so we don't sit back on a
[03:36:57.860 --> 03:37:02.820]  classist power trip and look down on you we understand that you were targeted
[03:37:02.820 --> 03:37:07.660]  first and have been basically taken over by the enemy to be destroyed right and
[03:37:07.660 --> 03:37:11.620]  so we're trying George Arwell said if there was any hope it was with the
[03:37:11.620 --> 03:37:17.980]  pros you know that their strength was evident but how do you communicate with
[03:37:17.980 --> 03:37:24.940]  them I don't I mean I do was signing my name or or waiting on something I
[03:37:24.940 --> 03:37:29.020]  communicate but I really don't communicate with him no I know but the
[03:37:29.020 --> 03:37:35.340]  pros of the common people the pros yeah but the system runs a communist
[03:37:35.340 --> 03:37:40.300]  ideology is its sub-operating system but there's an overlay extractor
[03:37:40.300 --> 03:37:47.060]  geopolitically on top of it that's a fascist technocracy so what I sucks I
[03:37:47.060 --> 03:37:50.660]  think that's not right what I'm saying is there's a science there's guys with
[03:37:50.660 --> 03:37:54.820]  giant egg heads that developed a plan right destroy everybody right how do I
[03:37:54.820 --> 03:37:58.260]  think about them yeah what do you think of them I don't like them they're not
[03:37:58.260 --> 03:38:03.820]  right they just get us in the lure is in and then shut us down that's how I look
[03:38:03.820 --> 03:38:09.260]  at it that's right they shut us down and see I want to beat people's brains out
[03:38:09.260 --> 03:38:13.660]  that are like that right just like you know I hate to say it I'm on air you
[03:38:13.660 --> 03:38:17.020]  know it's just like talking to you you say you're gonna do something do it you
[03:38:17.020 --> 03:38:21.660]  know and I'm waiting I'm waiting I'm waiting it's not done then you see other
[03:38:21.660 --> 03:38:26.380]  people are destroyed you know let me ask you this and I know they you told me
[03:38:26.380 --> 03:38:28.660]  more about it in the break but I don't know how much you can say tell us what
[03:38:28.660 --> 03:38:31.180]  you really think of Obama and what he's done to you and tell me what the
[03:38:31.180 --> 03:38:42.180]  Democrats told you after you came on the show well what I think about Obama is
[03:38:42.180 --> 03:38:49.660]  you did that you you did just enough you didn't go all the way with it you didn't
[03:38:49.660 --> 03:38:57.140]  do what you said you were gonna do and I really think you sucks because once I
[03:38:57.140 --> 03:39:00.820]  really when they told me I was an idiot for doing what I did with nine
[03:39:00.820 --> 03:39:06.740]  million viewers I really said I work for Obama $15 an hour I got this but
[03:39:06.740 --> 03:39:11.980]  really I was illiterate well they didn't want you showing why people were really
[03:39:11.980 --> 03:39:15.300]  voting for him and what they were being told they were done they wanted to
[03:39:15.300 --> 03:39:20.580]  deceive once I got yeah once I got it and got the votes and drove events with
[03:39:20.580 --> 03:39:26.260]  no license and helped them people out they fired me I lost the job on my own
[03:39:26.260 --> 03:39:30.580]  self going to sleep for the 12 hours or 15 hours I was working but really they
[03:39:30.580 --> 03:39:34.940]  fired me because they really told me that I made myself look stupid I said how
[03:39:34.940 --> 03:39:38.100]  did I make myself look stupid a man walked up to me and asked me a question I
[03:39:38.100 --> 03:39:42.060]  had the best poster and I was the only one got nine million views today you know
[03:39:42.060 --> 03:39:46.100]  so how did I make myself look stupid I didn't know no better because I everybody

[03:39:52.980 --> 03:39:56.940]  do more how do you know they were paying a Romney people to be there cuz the
[03:39:56.940 --> 03:40:01.260]  people told me on the other side on Mayfield said well you make 15 we make
[03:40:01.260 --> 03:40:05.340]  20 or on me around me gonna win around me ain't winning nothing look at all of
[03:40:05.340 --> 03:40:09.100]  us for Obama it was more people you know why Romney wasn't allowed to win
[03:40:09.100 --> 03:40:13.780]  because he couldn't sucker people as good as Obama and the only reason I
[03:40:13.780 --> 03:40:17.500]  believe Obama got suckered look at my viewers I got nine million viewers I
[03:40:17.500 --> 03:40:20.700]  was walking around and working for these people 15 hours a day do you know
[03:40:20.700 --> 03:40:24.820]  after 15 hours a day each hour I was getting over two to 300 people to go
[03:40:24.820 --> 03:40:29.180]  vote for him cuz they got a bomber phone they know that much about Obama well
[03:40:29.180 --> 03:40:33.980]  who bought you the phone Obama now now you think you told me before were there
[03:40:33.980 --> 03:40:38.100]  people voting repeatedly yes people was trying to go two or three times but you
[03:40:38.100 --> 03:40:42.300]  can't get on the vote for one you know especially when I told him who bought you
[03:40:42.300 --> 03:40:45.580]  the phone who you vote for a run of me why Ronnie Ronnie gonna give me my
[03:40:45.580 --> 03:40:48.780]  stamps around me upgrading the stamps they gonna upgrade the checks that's what
[03:40:48.780 --> 03:40:53.060]  a run of me people and they set out to do for him then we are also the Romney
[03:40:53.060 --> 03:40:56.300]  people were claiming he was gonna hand out good remember around me was supposed
[03:40:56.300 --> 03:41:00.260]  to do more than what Obama was doing but a run of me and had no name for this
[03:41:00.260 --> 03:41:05.780]  phone and most people what do you call him a Romney a run of me now he is like
[03:41:05.780 --> 03:41:10.580]  Obama many ways Romney you mean a run of me yeah run of me whatever but he was
[03:41:10.580 --> 03:41:14.620]  saying what he was gonna get Romney Mitt run of me yeah but he was saying what
[03:41:14.620 --> 03:41:20.780]  he was gonna do and only thing you know I'm I was thinking of something to let's
[03:41:20.780 --> 03:41:24.060]  get him you know when we sit at our meetings before we start work what was
[03:41:24.060 --> 03:41:29.420]  the catch and then I was I found out you know who bought you the phone Obama and
[03:41:29.420 --> 03:41:32.620]  everybody was telling me I'm voting for but so they don't see it that a taxpayers
[03:41:32.620 --> 03:41:36.700]  paid for that or somebody else an old lady had her house taken so they could
[03:41:36.700 --> 03:41:40.820]  buy the Obama phones they swat team you don't pay their taxes because they're
[03:41:40.820 --> 03:41:46.260]  so loving right see see that's the thing about the wealth transfer what about my
[03:41:46.260 --> 03:41:52.580]  dad who'd even paid all the income taxes and they came to him in like 1989 and
[03:41:52.580 --> 03:41:56.300]  said there's a retroactive tax you know now owe us a half million dollars and
[03:41:56.300 --> 03:42:00.060]  he didn't have it and we had to sell our cars and stuff and barely could keep our
[03:42:00.060 --> 03:42:03.100]  nice house and he had to sell some of his businesses and he was a guy
[03:42:03.100 --> 03:42:06.540]  employing a bunch of people he had to let people go what about my dad though
[03:42:06.540 --> 03:42:12.660]  she I mean I mean what's enough tax like if somebody's making $50,000 a year how
[03:42:12.660 --> 03:42:20.180]  much tax should they pay 10% well that you pay a lot more than that I mean you
[03:42:20.180 --> 03:42:24.900]  pay sales tax property tax and the average person making $50,000 a year
[03:42:24.900 --> 03:42:29.820]  half on average is paying about 40% in taxes how much do you think somebody
[03:42:29.820 --> 03:42:36.980]  making a million dollars a year pays about 70% if it on an insider oh how
[03:42:36.980 --> 03:42:40.620]  much do you think Warren Buffett pays percentage-wise maybe about half no about
[03:42:40.620 --> 03:42:43.340]  2% 2% how much you think general electric
[03:42:43.340 --> 03:42:47.900]  pace about 2% 0 0 how much you think Google pays I got a big company how much
[03:42:47.900 --> 03:42:52.060]  you think Google pays probably 0 3% 3 how much you think people like David
[03:42:52.060 --> 03:42:58.460]  Rockefeller David Rockefeller 2% 0 0 all tax exempt cuz he's a bill Gates how
[03:42:58.460 --> 03:43:03.300]  much Bill Gates pay 0 0 big money cuz they wrote the laws right same thing
[03:43:03.300 --> 03:43:08.580]  about Obama he the president tell me he can't make no right no loss who pays the
[03:43:08.580 --> 03:43:14.020]  highest taxes in France people making a million euros a year probably the
[03:43:14.020 --> 03:43:17.780]  millionaires now now we don't want you get up to billions of euros you don't
[03:43:17.780 --> 03:43:21.660]  hardly pay anything okay cuz they write the laws why do they want to shut down
[03:43:21.660 --> 03:43:26.420]  somebody making a million euros a year cuz they ain't getting another thing
[03:43:26.420 --> 03:43:32.380]  because almost all that money those directly to the poor people in services
[03:43:32.380 --> 03:43:37.380]  and now they open a hair boutique and now they do good hair they're making
[03:43:37.380 --> 03:43:42.500]  300,000 euros a year from the rich millionaires wives coming in to get
[03:43:42.500 --> 03:43:49.020]  their nails and eyelashes done hmm or they open up a personal training shop
[03:43:49.020 --> 03:43:53.820]  training dozens of people a day with trainers under them making $300,000
[03:43:53.820 --> 03:43:58.540]  300,000 euros a year do you think the billionaires want somebody to be a
[03:43:58.540 --> 03:44:02.700]  personal trainer like I know personal trainers making 200 300,000 dollars a
[03:44:02.700 --> 03:44:05.940]  year now they don't want you in business because you can't have that if there's
[03:44:05.940 --> 03:44:09.900]  not a bunch of rich middle-class people who poor people think of as ultra elite
[03:44:09.900 --> 03:44:16.860]  right the latter up is the people making 300,000 200,000 100,000 a year 70,000 a
[03:44:16.860 --> 03:44:21.140]  year a million a year they've got to be eliminated because historically
[03:44:21.140 --> 03:44:27.100]  economically you blow them up hmm Obama phone lady what happens I don't give you
[03:44:27.100 --> 03:44:32.740]  nothing every time it's the middle class that makes poor people middle class
[03:44:32.740 --> 03:44:36.860]  right and it's the middle class it's poor that become middle class that
[03:44:36.860 --> 03:44:41.900]  become rich it's called a ladder that are you gotta go Kennedy was a Democrat
[03:44:41.900 --> 03:44:48.180]  but he wasn't a eugenicist he cut taxes by 50% in the lowest tax bracket what
[03:44:48.180 --> 03:44:52.300]  happened the next year he was out well they did blow his head off that's true
[03:44:52.300 --> 03:44:58.140]  but double tax receipts right why would cutting taxes in half double tax
[03:44:58.140 --> 03:45:03.780]  receipts cuz who gonna pay for everybody runs around spending the money now
[03:45:03.780 --> 03:45:08.300]  right economy gets going real fast more revenue comes in so why would they want
[03:45:08.300 --> 03:45:14.500]  taxes so high it shuts the economy off for business because the big boys are
[03:45:14.500 --> 03:45:18.180]  exempt so they only want taxes on a little guy so you can't operate right
[03:45:18.180 --> 03:45:22.100]  right they don't want you in competition John D Rockefeller said
[03:45:22.100 --> 03:45:29.820]  competition is a sin hmm ain't no competition really the ultra rich that
[03:45:29.820 --> 03:45:36.540]  aren't free market don't want competition they don't want you to know
[03:45:36.540 --> 03:45:42.700]  anything right because if you ever discovered the mysteries of the universe
[03:45:42.700 --> 03:45:47.820]  you would be free of them mm-hmm Michelle dowry let's take some more phone

[03:46:19.700 --> 03:46:23.180]  Latin America they've done exactly that with a conduit from Central America

[03:47:48.620 --> 03:47:54.860]  never does and carbon taxes or the scowl fall Janice go ahead yeah I wanted to
[03:47:54.860 --> 03:47:59.660]  talk to Michelle last year and I want to talk to her this year all right I have a
[03:47:59.660 --> 03:48:03.460]  couple notes a couple points I don't want to be interrupted if I can get them
[03:48:03.460 --> 03:48:08.900]  out as fast as I can Michelle I'm poor also was raised in Detroit I was offered
[03:48:08.900 --> 03:48:15.100]  an Obama phone and I didn't want it because I wanted to keep my privacy the
[03:48:15.100 --> 03:48:20.500]  government has offered those free cell phones for a long time and he didn't even
[03:48:20.500 --> 03:48:25.140]  come up with Obama care that was the Clinton started that even before that
[03:48:25.140 --> 03:48:31.100]  but what my point was is that I have black friends several and have had
[03:48:31.100 --> 03:48:35.060]  black friends and one of my black friends was the night of the so-called
[03:48:35.060 --> 03:48:42.340]  election the first time Obama was in was excited about the first being you know
[03:48:42.340 --> 03:48:48.140]  the first black president which that's understandable you know that you be
[03:48:48.140 --> 03:48:54.220]  excited as a black person you know about having the first black president but I
[03:48:54.220 --> 03:49:00.340]  am reminded of Martin Luther King who said that he was hopeful that his
[03:49:00.340 --> 03:49:05.380]  children could be judged not by the color of their skin but by according to the
[03:49:05.380 --> 03:49:09.860]  content of their character and so what was more important because I told my
[03:49:09.860 --> 03:49:15.380]  friend he's probably a Muslim with a name like Barack Hussein Obama she said
[03:49:15.380 --> 03:49:19.300]  no he's not and besides what difference does it make and see this is what's
[03:49:19.300 --> 03:49:22.780]  wrong with people's thinking now the other point I wanted to make Michelle real
[03:49:22.780 --> 03:49:27.340]  quick is the government give us and the government can take it away but there's
[03:49:27.340 --> 03:49:31.180]  always a cost no matter who it is doesn't matter if it's Obama or whoever
[03:49:31.180 --> 03:49:34.960]  look at every time it degenerates into a living hell now ma'am we're gonna get
[03:49:34.960 --> 03:49:39.180]  interrupted by the break here in a moment did you have any questions for us
[03:49:39.180 --> 03:49:43.140]  someone in our own country has to pay for it and we're the government of the
[03:49:43.140 --> 03:49:49.300]  people and by the people government is not something up there like a sugar
[03:49:49.300 --> 03:49:53.780]  daddy the role of to help poor people like myself and you Michelle is the
[03:49:53.780 --> 03:49:58.580]  churches the churches are supposed to help not the government and so Alex has
[03:49:58.580 --> 03:50:03.020]  done a lot to help me with my thinking and there's some basic you know thought
[03:50:03.020 --> 03:50:07.740]  patterns that we need to get right we are a republic not a democracy and that's
[03:50:07.740 --> 03:50:12.580]  way our founding fathers meant it through the Constitution and the other
[03:50:12.580 --> 03:50:18.860]  federal papers so ma'am we're out of time I apologize the other callers Greg
[03:50:18.860 --> 03:50:23.380]  and Jesse and Jared and Ben I've got a cut to overdrive off now retransmissions
[03:50:23.380 --> 03:50:28.780]  coming up with John Rappaport and others on the Ebola situation and so much more
[03:50:28.780 --> 03:50:33.660]  all I know is we have a political class that wants us domesticated like you know
[03:50:33.660 --> 03:50:36.700]  a farmer who's got cows out there he didn't really love me plans to slaughter
[03:50:36.700 --> 03:50:42.260]  right our pigs I'm saying we're men we're not domesticated human resources of
[03:50:42.260 --> 03:50:46.100]  the state and so that's what I'm telling you is it's predatory it's done out of
[03:50:46.100 --> 03:50:49.820]  evil Obama phone lady Michelle dowry thank you so much for being with us
[03:50:49.820 --> 03:50:53.980]  you'll be back tomorrow live from the shooting range on air with us all right
