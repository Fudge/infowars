[00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:11.900]   >> From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:14.620]   [MUSIC]
[00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:19.400]   >> Wednesday, March 27th, 2019.
[00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:24.280]   And the Mueller report coming up empty is even more devastating to the deep state
[00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:28.080]   and the globalist media combine that I thought they are in ratings.
[00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:33.080]   >> Total implosion free fall, their credibility already close to zero has
[00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:34.560]   now gone negative.
[00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:38.920]   The small it arrogance because it goes all the way up to Obama.
[00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:45.560]   The arrogance of the system letting him off Scott free is now spiraling
[00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:49.840]   completely out of control, blowing up in their faces,
[00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:54.520]   their hubris and arrogance meets reality.
[00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:58.400]   But first, we've seen a lot of compilations of the Russiagate fail, but
[00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:00.640]   here's one of the biggest and most extensive and
[00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.800]   newest that we posted to info wars.com.
[00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:04.640]   >> Breaking news.
[00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:09.840]   >> My God, breaking news, ABC News Brian Ross is reporting.
[00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.120]   Michael Flynn promised full cooperation to the Mueller team and
[00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:16.560]   is prepared to testify that as a candidate,
[00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.520]   Donald Trump directed him to make contact with the Russians.
[00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:29.520]   >> [APPLAUSE]
[00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:36.200]   >> I'm confident now even more so than I have been throughout the last year that
[00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:40.400]   this nightmare presidency of Donald John Trump will end prematurely and end soon.
[00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.080]   >> If we discover that Donald Trump or
[00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:48.320]   his advocates played a role in helping to devise strategy.
[00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:51.160]   If they're the ones who came up with crooked Hillary.
[00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:52.200]   >> Crooked Hillary.
[00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:57.800]   >> I think that is something that would put the question squarely on the table,
[00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:59.280]   whether or not he should be impeached.
[00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.600]   >> It supposedly happened in 2013,
[00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:05.120]   the year Trump hosted the Miss Universe pageant in Moscow.
[00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:10.480]   >> The bombshell burst Tuesday evening when CNN reported the President-elect and
[00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:14.080]   President Obama were briefed on the matter last week.
[00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:19.120]   The report included unsubstantiated claims that Russian intelligence
[00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.720]   compiled a dossier on Mr. Trump during visits to Moscow.
[00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:28.440]   >> He dismissed outright the very idea that he would take part in the sordid acts
[00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:29.960]   described in the report.
[00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:32.240]   >> He denied everything, he called it all fake news.
[00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:36.280]   >> The 35 page dossier on the so-called Russian connection to Trump,
[00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:40.400]   with some very salacious allegations, including unsubstantiated claims
[00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:44.760]   about Trump in a Moscow hotel room, was not completed until just before
[00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.840]   the election, and then provided to journalists, the Clinton campaign, and
[00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:49.640]   the FBI.
[00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:53.320]   >> It claims that Donald Trump once visited Russia,
[00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:55.880]   stayed in the Ritz Carlton in Moscow, and
[00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:59.280]   then hired prostitutes to perform a golden shower.
[00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:02.400]   And that Russia might have the whole thing on tape.
[00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:09.520]   >> There were surveillance cameras in this room because the building is wired,
[00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:13.320]   and that the FSB has this because they automatically have cameras in the room,
[00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:14.520]   and they caught this happening.
[00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:18.440]   >> Donald Trump engaged in perverted acts with prostitutes.
[00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:20.600]   Trump immediately denied the report.
[00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:23.160]   I'd like to ask you about your big Russian pee-pee party.
[00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.240]   >> No, no, I am not talking about the pee-pee.
[00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:28.560]   >> [LAUGH] >> Because it didn't happen.
[00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:32.400]   >> From there, the President-elect lit into the news media again.
[00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.080]   He condemned BuzzFeed.
[00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:38.440]   >> It's a failing pile of garbage, writing it.
[00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:40.480]   I think they're gonna suffer the consequences they already are.
[00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:43.960]   >> And he accused CNN of being fake news, and
[00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:48.680]   brushed off persistent attempts by its correspondent to ask a question.
[00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:53.440]   Later, CNN's parent company, Time Warner, defended its reporting.
[00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:57.760]   And BuzzFeed said it published what it called a newsworthy document.
[00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:02.320]   >> It claims Trump set out to defile the suite because President Obama and
[00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:07.480]   the First Family had once stayed there, and Trump, quote, hated the Obamas.
[00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:14.040]   >> Everything that I had written in the months prior to that dossier coming out
[00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:16.320]   was almost identical to what the CIA had written,
[00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:19.200]   because we're intelligence officers, this is what we do.
[00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:23.680]   >> That corroboration, based on intercepted communications, has given US
[00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:28.200]   intelligence and law enforcement, quote, greater confidence in the credibility of
[00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:30.240]   some aspects of the dossier.
[00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:34.520]   >> The most salacious and unverified claims are that the Russian Secret Service,
[00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:40.040]   or FSB, secretly filmed Mr. Trump with prostitutes in this Moscow hotel room
[00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:41.240]   three years ago.
[00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:44.320]   >> Allegations the special counsel continues to investigate, George.
[00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:47.520]   >> And so far, it is us as American citizens, it is us in the press.
[00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:50.840]   >> All right, folks, I gotta tell you, I think that's probably the ultimate
[00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:58.000]   mainstream media Russia delusion failure compilation.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.160]   [MUSIC]
[00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:04.960]   >> The globalists, the eugenicists, are always talking down to us.
[00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:09.160]   They're always trying to make us feel small, to feel insignificant.
[00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:13.120]   They try to censor because they fear you and don't want you to have the right to
[00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:17.080]   access information so you can make your own decisions.
[00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:20.240]   They want you to believe you're powerless.
[00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:25.200]   But the truth is, it is we the people and our ideas and our actions, and
[00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:28.200]   what we say and what we do that changes the world.
[00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:30.240]   We are the power structure.
[00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:31.840]   We are the inventors.
[00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:33.640]   We are the trailblazers.
[00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:37.000]   And the globalists understand that.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.160]   And they understand that they are basically trying to control and
[00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:42.960]   steal the future from we the people.
[00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:47.080]   Now, to help fund our operation that is undoubtedly the very tip of the spear
[00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:51.440]   against these globalists, I wanna encourage listeners and viewers to understand
[00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:54.720]   that throughout the second half of the month of March, we're going to have
[00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:58.240]   store-wide free shipping at 50% off InfoWarsTore.com,
[00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:01.040]   something everybody should take advantage of.
[00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:11.040]   [MUSIC]
[00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:16.680]   >> You are listening to an InfoWars.com frontline report.
[00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:18.400]   It's Alex Jones.
[00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:28.400]   [MUSIC]
[00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:38.200]   >> Ladies and gentlemen,
[00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:41.440]   [MUSIC]
[00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:45.280]   Thank you so much for joining us on this Wednesday,
[00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:49.120]   March the 20th, 2019 worldwide broadcast.
[00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:54.680]   I intend to open the phones up early in the show to get your take on just
[00:06:54.680 --> 00:07:00.320]   the route of the left and how everything they touch is imploding and
[00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:04.320]   turning to ashes, except one thing.
[00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:10.840]   That's massive censorship by Google, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube,
[00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:15.640]   and all the other suspects to steal the 2018 election and
[00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:19.040]   they're bragging they're gonna do it in 2020.
[00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:22.960]   Yes, everything they're doing is a failure, the Malazzi Ford hoax,
[00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:25.240]   the Trump's not gonna win hoax.
[00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:27.920]   Trump's a Russian agent, all his supporters are Russian agents,
[00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:30.200]   are in league with the Russians hoax.
[00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:35.840]   All of the hoaxes are falling on their face,
[00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:42.360]   and people are really starting to get it in a big way.
[00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:49.360]   But you see the arrogance of them letting Smollett off because
[00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:53.960]   obviously Obama was involved, the evidence is coming out.
[00:07:53.960 --> 00:08:03.640]   Obviously, you see all of this unfolding.
[00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:06.640]   It's just.
[00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:30.200]   >> Good afternoon, today as you have figured out,
[00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:35.080]   the state made a motion to nolly cross the charges against
[00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:40.000]   Jussie Smollett and to seal the record in this case.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.800]   We believe that it was the correct result in this case.
[00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:47.840]   We're very happy for this result, and we are very anxious for
[00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:54.000]   Jussie to get on with his career and his life and to move forward.
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:55.040]   I'll take any questions.
[00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:57.000]   >> Was this part of a deferred prosecution deal?
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:57.800]   >> This is not.
[00:08:57.800 --> 00:08:58.640]   >> How did they drop the charges?
[00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:00.960]   >> There is no deferred prosecution.
[00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:05.200]   The motion was to nolly cross, which is a legal technical term,
[00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:07.200]   for dismiss the charges.
[00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:09.680]   >> Why did he give up the bond money?
[00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:14.000]   >> Jussie voluntarily agreed to the forfeiture of the bond money.
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:15.560]   >> So where is it going?
[00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:18.280]   >> We believe to the city of Chicago, but we don't know.
[00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:21.120]   >> Is this a deal or not a deal if he's giving up his bond?
[00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:24.400]   >> There is no deal, the state dismissed the charges.
[00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:26.560]   >> Was this part of the agreement?
[00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:28.840]   >> What did he say to the police department?
[00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:33.480]   >> We have nothing to say to the police department except to investigate charges
[00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:36.880]   and not try their cases in the press.
[00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:43.000]   But to allow matters to be investigated, allow the state to investigate and
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:47.280]   to bring charges and not to jump ahead and
[00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:53.440]   utilize the press to convict people before they are tried in a court of law.
[00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:55.880]   >> Are you gonna bear people red horse for the city?
[00:09:55.880 --> 00:09:59.560]   Are you gonna keep leaving reports of the city or the two brothers?
[00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:00.600]   >> Next question.
[00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:04.320]   >> You won't say whether you'll keep reports, not the member map?
[00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:08.680]   >> Do you think that the city put a lot of attention on Mr.
[00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:14.040]   Chialla because of the pressure that was coming down from the city of Chicago,
[00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:17.480]   but with all the attention that you put on the press?
[00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:20.400]   >> I have no idea what occurred in this case.
[00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:24.520]   >> So again, ladies and gentlemen, why are these people so arrogant?
[00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:28.840]   Because they know they've got Obama and the deep state protecting them.
[00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:36.480]   Why has Brennan and Clapper and Hillary and Obama and all of them been so
[00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:41.640]   arrogant because again, they've still got their stay behind networks
[00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:44.400]   inside of the government operating.
[00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:47.320]   And so they believe they're protected.
[00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:49.320]   They already tried this coup d'etat against the president,
[00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:52.040]   this administrative coup d'etat, and they're going to try more.
[00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:57.440]   You better believe all of this is being orchestrated by Barack Obama,
[00:10:57.440 --> 00:10:59.720]   who never left DC, and who moved in a mile and
[00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:01.600]   a half from the White House in an armored compound.
[00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:07.000]   And they're still executing all these operations.
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.240]   That's why President Trump was asked yesterday if he thought that
[00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:14.280]   this went back to Barack Obama.
[00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:16.040]   Of course it goes back to Barack Obama.
[00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:18.920]   We've known that since Trump got elected,
[00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:24.360]   Obama bragged that I've had intelligence agencies spying on Trump.
[00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:26.560]   And we know he's a Russian agent, and
[00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:31.120]   we're going to probably stop him from being seated as the 45th president.
[00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:35.760]   The New York Times interviewed Obama, and
[00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:41.080]   he said we're giving all the data to the media right now to stop him.
[00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:45.120]   Then once Trump got into office and Trump pointed out that was illegal,
[00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:47.560]   they went, we never did that, that's insane.
[00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:49.760]   As if you have no memory.
[00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:53.480]   So yes, of course it goes back to Obama.
[00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:56.320]   That's what they've been doing the whole time.
[00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:58.680]   But first, here is Rahm Emanuel.
[00:11:58.680 --> 00:12:02.360]   Never thought I'd be agreeing with him, but he knows how bad this is.
[00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:04.960]   Turning against Obama and Obama's lawyers and
[00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:06.640]   others that were directly over this.
[00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:13.360]   Don't forget, the head attorney over the county attorney's office
[00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:17.960]   is buddies with Obama, buddies with Smollett, buddies with all these people.
[00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:24.000]   And she recused herself, but then still dropped the charges.
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:29.760]   So they just do whatever they want.
[00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:32.920]   They're lawless, and they've gotten away with it so long.
[00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:35.840]   They think they can just get even more brazen about it.
[00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:37.080]   And that's what's frightening.
[00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:37.800]   Here's Rahm Emanuel.
[00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:41.640]   >> This is a whitewash of justice.
[00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:45.160]   A grand jury could not have been clearer.
[00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:51.880]   To then say, not only is the cost, $10,000 doesn't come cost financially.
[00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:56.760]   But all the other repercussions of this decision it made to me.
[00:12:56.760 --> 00:13:00.560]   Where is the accountability in the system?
[00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:03.960]   You cannot have, because of a person's position,
[00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:10.560]   one set of rules apply to them, and another set of rules apply to everybody else.
[00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:15.600]   In another way, you're seeing this play out in the universities,
[00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:20.760]   where people pay extra to get their kids a special position in universities.
[00:13:20.760 --> 00:13:23.360]   Now you have a person, because of their position and background,
[00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:27.760]   who's getting treated in a way that nobody else would ever, sorry about that.
[00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:29.400]   Don't get near my sermon here.
[00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:30.440]   >> [LAUGH]
[00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:34.680]   >> That would ever get close to this type of treatment.
[00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:39.400]   Our officers did hard work day in and day out,
[00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:44.640]   countless hours, working to unwind what actually happened that night.
[00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:51.000]   The city saw its reputation dragged through the mud.
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.480]   But I remind everybody, it was not just the officer's work.
[00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:59.400]   That work, a piece of that work, was shown to a grand jury.
[00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:03.000]   And they made a decision based on only a sliver of the evidence.
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:08.080]   And as I remember correctly, somebody wanted to have that evidence in the day,
[00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:10.800]   and the thing is, the superintendent said, their day in court, so
[00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:12.440]   all the evidence could be made public.
[00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:14.600]   Because of the judge's decision,
[00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:17.680]   none of that evidence will ever be made public.
[00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:21.680]   None of it.
[00:14:21.680 --> 00:14:27.960]   This is without a doubt a whitewash of justice and sends a clear message
[00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:33.960]   that if you're in a position of influence and power, you'll get treated one way.
[00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:35.400]   Other people will be treated another way.
[00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:38.640]   There is no accountability than in the system.
[00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:40.560]   It is wrong, full stop.
[00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:45.080]   >> So even incredibly corrupt people like Emmanuel know you can't defend this.
[00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:47.400]   The whole thing's illegal.
[00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:49.720]   You've got Obama's fingerprints all over it.
[00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:52.680]   When we come back, I've got really where this is all going.
[00:14:52.680 --> 00:14:55.680]   What I've been saying since last Friday, what I've been saying today,
[00:14:55.680 --> 00:15:03.240]   is that it's because Obama is running these operations with the deep state.
[00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:07.880]   And Trump was asked about it just yesterday, and he said, yeah.
[00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:10.760]   We're obviously thinking this is Obama.
[00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:13.360]   I don't want to say that, but that's what we think.
[00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:15.040]   You can put two and two together.
[00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:18.120]   We'll get his actual quote when we come back, I'll then give the number out.
[00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:19.280]   We'll take a lot of calls today.
[00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:20.680]   We have a bunch of big guests.
[00:15:20.680 --> 00:15:24.800]   I haven't even told you about either that are going to be coming up.
[00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:28.760]   But I cannot overstate what a big moment this is.
[00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:30.280]   They have gone way too far.
[00:15:30.280 --> 00:15:34.160]   They have gotten away with so much that everyone I know is turning against
[00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:36.840]   the left right now, including their own people.
[00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:38.440]   And they're eating their own.
[00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:40.440]   And this is a very dangerous period, though,
[00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:43.040]   because you don't know what they're going to pull next.
[00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:45.320]   These people are entitled and they're crazy.
[00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:46.880]   And they stage stuff.
[00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:51.400]   Just this weekend, I had people threaten me and stalk me, and
[00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:54.880]   then edit video with mainstream media to say I stalked them.
[00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:58.120]   And mainstream media will not link to our raw footage that proves the truth.
[00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:00.720]   Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:03.680]   I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my
[00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:04.640]   mother's house.
[00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:06.160]   I sued the IRS and won.
[00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:09.120]   I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:12.280]   I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal
[00:16:12.280 --> 00:16:14.680]   with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[00:16:14.680 --> 00:16:15.880]   I can help you too.
[00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:18.840]   If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:21.040]   There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:25.480]   Call 800-34-NO-TAX or go to my website, danpilla.com.

[00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:32.880]   >> The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States
[00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:35.280]   is the empire of the world.
[00:16:35.280 --> 00:16:38.320]   George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:44.200]   The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:48.040]   Its former colony, the US, had to save the empire.
[00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:49.320]   Was there ever a vote?
[00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:50.640]   Who do we fight for?
[00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:53.560]   The deep state began with World War I.

[00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:03.720]   InfoWars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:05.520]   Introducing Pollen Block.
[00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:10.800]   We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms,
[00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:17.560]   including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:22.840]   In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs
[00:18:22.840 --> 00:18:26.760]   experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:29.560]   They began studying this effect in published trials,
[00:18:29.560 --> 00:18:32.680]   and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research.
[00:18:32.680 --> 00:18:37.760]   A fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:40.360]   Pollen Block is natural and effective.
[00:18:40.360 --> 00:18:42.080]   It is not an antihistamine.
[00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:47.160]   In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase,
[00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:52.120]   which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[00:18:52.120 --> 00:18:54.760]   Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[00:18:54.760 --> 00:18:59.760]   Head to InfoWarsLife.com and grab a pack of our Pollen Block chewable tablets.

[00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:22.640]   stamina, libido, workout, brain formula that is safe.

[00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:27.280]   and from seeing my friends and family use it

[00:19:59.560 --> 00:20:06.400]   You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:26.400]   [MUSIC]
[00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:30.480]   You found it, the tip of the spear of the front lines in the information war
[00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:34.560]   on this Wednesday, March 27th, 2019 transmission.
[00:20:34.560 --> 00:20:35.680]   I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:37.920]   So I'm going to get the number out.
[00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:41.240]   We're going to take your calls throughout the rest of the three and a half hours we
[00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:43.000]   left of this broadcast.
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:45.160]   We also have a bunch of big guests that I'll tell you about at the start of the
[00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:49.080]   next segment, but let me get back to Jussie Smollett.
[00:20:49.080 --> 00:20:51.000]   This is bigger than the TV show Empire.
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:53.400]   It's bigger than the ridiculous actor.
[00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:55.920]   It's bigger than the false flag he ran.
[00:20:55.920 --> 00:20:59.840]   It's about the corporate system protecting him.
[00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:05.400]   It's about the fact that Obama is clearly involved, along with the producers and
[00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:10.480]   the others from the intel we have, in basically green lighting this.
[00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:13.960]   And when the letter that he staged against himself didn't work,
[00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:15.000]   things had to be upped.
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:23.440]   And now we see Empire writers taunt Smollett critics,
[00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:28.200]   slam Chicago journalists, and even the police are being taunted by Smollett.
[00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:33.800]   You reported a bunch of false information, they say.
[00:21:33.800 --> 00:21:34.920]   They're now on a high horse.
[00:21:34.920 --> 00:21:40.080]   So not content to slink away and have the charges dropped and
[00:21:40.080 --> 00:21:47.880]   his record wiped clean, reportedly other pending crimes wiped clean as well.
[00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:49.120]   We have to be taunted.
[00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:57.840]   That's the nature of this arrogant, narcissistic psychosis that we're facing
[00:21:57.840 --> 00:22:01.720]   by these people because they've gotten away with it so many times.
[00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:02.240]   Why not?
[00:22:03.640 --> 00:22:06.160]   Any other conservative who got caught wearing blackface or
[00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:10.440]   in a KKK outfit would be out of office, but not the governor of Virginia.
[00:22:10.440 --> 00:22:13.480]   Hell, he can talk about keeping babies alive and selling their organs.
[00:22:13.480 --> 00:22:17.680]   Because he's a Democrat, he's above the law.
[00:22:17.680 --> 00:22:22.320]   Hillary can have thousands of illegal emails and a server and
[00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:23.760]   be on the payroll of foreign governments.
[00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:29.720]   That's all okay, because she's part of the anointed Chicago club, particularly.
[00:22:29.720 --> 00:22:32.320]   You're from Yale, you're from Harvard, you're from New York City,
[00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:35.840]   from the elites, you're from the Chicago elites, you're from the LA elites.
[00:22:35.840 --> 00:22:38.160]   You can do anything you want.
[00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:43.920]   You can buy your kid a front row seat in college, and
[00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:48.000]   a lot of times the college even gives you a scholarship back as a kickback.
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:50.960]   It's incredible.
[00:22:50.960 --> 00:22:56.920]   And that's the religion of the left is creating guilt and rubbing those of us
[00:22:56.920 --> 00:23:01.160]   that actually have a conscience noses in these imaginary crimes
[00:23:01.160 --> 00:23:08.440]   that we have supposedly committed, but it goes back to Obama.
[00:23:08.440 --> 00:23:11.200]   That's what I told you a month ago as it's being investigated,
[00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:13.680]   the connection between Obama and
[00:23:13.680 --> 00:23:18.520]   the cover up initially of this case that Ms. Fox tried.
[00:23:18.520 --> 00:23:21.920]   And now it comes out, she recused herself, put herself back in.
[00:23:21.920 --> 00:23:24.120]   There's Obama lawyers involved.
[00:23:24.120 --> 00:23:27.760]   Of course, because Obama was involved with his foundation and
[00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:30.120]   groups directing all this race baiting.
[00:23:30.120 --> 00:23:33.920]   Obama got caught having the Justice Department on the ground trying to stage
[00:23:33.920 --> 00:23:39.560]   riots with Trayvon Martin in the aftermath, and in Ferguson.
[00:23:39.560 --> 00:23:45.000]   And that whole thing, it came out in documents, was being funded by Soros.
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:46.520]   So of course this is going on.
[00:23:46.520 --> 00:23:50.080]   And it's come out in mainstream news that Soros Foundation,
[00:23:50.080 --> 00:23:53.400]   if you put it back on screen, I'll tell radio listeners about it.
[00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:59.600]   That Soros is heavily involved in financing the whole thing.
[00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:01.840]   So when you talk about Obama and Soros, they're interchangeable.
[00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:07.880]   Ann Coulter, Jesse Smollett, prosecutor, a George Soros puppet.
[00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:12.960]   And then she recused herself because the police were investigating her,
[00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:14.920]   then she jumped back in and let him off.
[00:24:14.920 --> 00:24:16.080]   That itself is criminal.
[00:24:16.080 --> 00:24:19.160]   This is scary, folks.
[00:24:19.160 --> 00:24:22.280]   And they've got so much dirt on other people in Chicago,
[00:24:22.280 --> 00:24:24.240]   they think they're gonna be protected.
[00:24:24.240 --> 00:24:25.880]   They think they're gonna be safe.
[00:24:25.880 --> 00:24:26.920]   It's wild.
[00:24:29.400 --> 00:24:32.280]   But it shows the humorous, it shows the delusional,
[00:24:32.280 --> 00:24:35.200]   it shows how far these people are willing to go.
[00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:38.040]   Balazi Ford and all those women admitting it was fake.
[00:24:38.040 --> 00:24:46.320]   And all the other false flags and all the other staged events.
[00:24:46.320 --> 00:24:50.480]   And it just shows you where this culture is going.
[00:24:50.480 --> 00:24:52.680]   And we've gotta ask ourselves, how do we counter it?
[00:24:52.680 --> 00:24:55.040]   And what do you think's gonna come out of it?
[00:24:55.040 --> 00:25:00.640]   Because since the Russiagate hoax imploded, it's ten times worse,
[00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:06.840]   in my estimation, than them saying 98% chance Hillary would win.
[00:25:06.840 --> 00:25:13.640]   In the New York Times and CNN, pulling that number out of their rear end.
[00:25:13.640 --> 00:25:16.200]   It's incredibly worse.
[00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:21.200]   And the numbers show it, imploding ratings at CNN, imploding ratings at MSNBC.
[00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:24.240]   They don't know what to do, cuz their ratings were basically dead.
[00:25:24.240 --> 00:25:28.440]   And then Trump got in the lead, won, their ratings bounced a little bit.
[00:25:28.440 --> 00:25:32.120]   It's a dead cat bounce, wasn't even a third of their former greatness.
[00:25:32.120 --> 00:25:36.000]   And then now that the whole Russiagate telling their viewers for
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:41.160]   years that Russians had taken over and their cult-like viewers believed it.
[00:25:41.160 --> 00:25:42.640]   And now it's not true.
[00:25:42.640 --> 00:25:46.480]   They don't know what to do.
[00:25:46.480 --> 00:25:50.320]   But see, with the viewers of MSNBC and CNN, most of them know it's a fraud.
[00:25:50.320 --> 00:25:51.440]   They're just political ideologues.
[00:25:51.440 --> 00:25:52.680]   They just wanna be in power.
[00:25:52.680 --> 00:25:54.960]   And they live vicariously through their parties and
[00:25:54.960 --> 00:25:56.080]   through the mainstream media.
[00:25:56.080 --> 00:26:01.080]   It's all about their envisioned superiority.
[00:26:01.080 --> 00:26:14.200]   And so it's not really about how they now know they've been lied to.
[00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:20.440]   It's that they say, wait, MSNBC and CNN and NPR can't deliver us power.
[00:26:21.560 --> 00:26:25.440]   They can't deliver us bigger welfare checks and bigger government jobs to rule
[00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:28.360]   over the rest of the people in flyover country.
[00:26:28.360 --> 00:26:29.640]   That's why they're so upset.
[00:26:29.640 --> 00:26:31.400]   That's why they're so mad.
[00:26:31.400 --> 00:26:34.080]   I'm at a chicken place that has oysters.
[00:26:34.080 --> 00:26:36.480]   My wife wants some oysters, Saturday night.
[00:26:36.480 --> 00:26:40.520]   They walk by, we're sitting three times and say, we're gonna get you, F you,
[00:26:40.520 --> 00:26:42.800]   eat crap, all this other mean stuff.
[00:26:42.800 --> 00:26:47.000]   I walk outside, they're waiting for me, screaming and yelling and cussing at me.
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:48.520]   I have to walk past them.
[00:26:48.520 --> 00:26:49.800]   I finally yell back at them.
[00:26:49.800 --> 00:26:53.200]   They edit the tape and the news runs it all over the country.
[00:26:53.200 --> 00:26:56.640]   Top story on Reddit, bunch of fake newspapers saying,
[00:26:56.640 --> 00:26:58.720]   Jones just randomly starts screaming at people.
[00:26:58.720 --> 00:27:03.920]   You're like, how do they all unify and engage in something like that?
[00:27:03.920 --> 00:27:06.040]   Because they watch mainstream media.
[00:27:06.040 --> 00:27:08.240]   They're learning how to do this.
[00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:12.840]   Every New York Times reporter I've talked to has lied about what I said.
[00:27:12.840 --> 00:27:17.520]   Every, all of them, you have to understand, folks, they all know they're liars.
[00:27:17.520 --> 00:27:19.760]   They all know their job is to kill the truth.
[00:27:19.760 --> 00:27:21.840]   They all know they're anti-American.
[00:27:21.840 --> 00:27:24.520]   They know they're on the Chai Com Payroll.
[00:27:24.520 --> 00:27:28.640]   They know, they believe the deep state was going to win.
[00:27:28.640 --> 00:27:33.000]   But now, two and a half years in, nothing they do works anymore.
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:35.840]   And so they're starting to panic.
[00:27:35.840 --> 00:27:37.640]   They don't know what to do.
[00:27:37.640 --> 00:27:42.400]   Their whole identity is how they're part of this powerful socialist,
[00:27:42.400 --> 00:27:43.560]   communist takeover.
[00:27:43.560 --> 00:27:48.880]   Half the shirts the people were wearing that screamed at me and said,
[00:27:48.880 --> 00:27:53.040]   kill the rich and all this stuff, were women socialists and
[00:27:53.040 --> 00:27:57.960]   all these Democratic Party AOC groups.
[00:27:57.960 --> 00:27:59.680]   They believe this is their time.
[00:27:59.680 --> 00:28:01.440]   They believe this is their takeover.
[00:28:01.440 --> 00:28:06.240]   They believe that they have a right to rule you and your children and
[00:28:06.240 --> 00:28:08.240]   what you say and what you do and how you talk.
[00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:09.760]   And by God, they're going to do it.
[00:28:09.760 --> 00:28:14.240]   Except it's not working because the more they push, the stronger we get.
[00:28:14.240 --> 00:28:16.040]   So now they're going to get more violent.
[00:28:16.040 --> 00:28:18.280]   They're going to get more crazy, but you got to know.
[00:28:18.280 --> 00:28:20.400]   They're going to export what they've done at universities and
[00:28:20.400 --> 00:28:23.560]   in big mainstream media, where they stage events against themselves.
[00:28:23.560 --> 00:28:26.160]   And they're going to export it to your church, to your police department,
[00:28:26.160 --> 00:28:29.040]   to your town, and you've got to be on the watch.
[00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:31.400]   They're not going to stop false flags.
[00:28:31.400 --> 00:28:34.000]   They're going to intensify them.
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:35.920]   So you get ready.

[00:28:46.720 --> 00:28:48.880]   But I like to talk about Smollett, the Russiagate.
[00:28:48.880 --> 00:28:50.200]   What are they going to pull next?
[00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:51.640]   What do you think is coming down the road?
[00:28:51.640 --> 00:28:54.280]   Please comment on that, then you can bring up a secondary item.

[00:31:02.840 --> 00:31:06.240]   put it together with our own four years of seeking and

[00:32:43.120 --> 00:32:44.960]   I've got two in my home.
[00:32:44.960 --> 00:32:48.200]   You will notice the difference, ladies and gentlemen,
[00:32:48.200 --> 00:32:51.000]   with the Alexa Pure Breeze in your house.
[00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:55.680]   Don't live in a polluted major city in your home.
[00:32:55.680 --> 00:32:56.760]   Have clean air.
[00:32:56.760 --> 00:32:58.680]   Go to InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:32:58.680 --> 00:33:05.680]   You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:05.680 --> 00:33:20.000]   Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:21.800]   It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:25.760 --> 00:33:31.640]   >> Okay, one of our producers, Scott, has been doing a lot of research on Smollett.
[00:33:31.640 --> 00:33:35.160]   And what I'm going to do is I'm going to hit this actually at the start of the next
[00:33:35.160 --> 00:33:38.480]   segment because I'm aware of it all, but I want to reread one of the documents I
[00:33:38.480 --> 00:33:40.400]   didn't have a chance to during the break.
[00:33:40.400 --> 00:33:43.520]   I read, scanned over the other four or five.
[00:33:43.520 --> 00:33:45.920]   But here's the bottom line, I'll break it down next segment.
[00:33:45.920 --> 00:33:51.640]   Everybody keeps asking how Kim Fox,
[00:33:51.640 --> 00:33:56.960]   the head Cook County State Attorney, said she recused herself, but
[00:33:56.960 --> 00:34:00.400]   then didn't and then dropped the charges.
[00:34:00.400 --> 00:34:04.240]   And we went and got the court documents and the state law.
[00:34:04.240 --> 00:34:04.840]   She lied.
[00:34:04.840 --> 00:34:06.560]   She never recused herself.
[00:34:06.560 --> 00:34:08.480]   You've got to appoint a special counsel when you do that.
[00:34:08.480 --> 00:34:09.480]   None was appointed.
[00:34:09.480 --> 00:34:10.920]   The papers weren't filed.
[00:34:10.920 --> 00:34:11.640]   None of it was done.
[00:34:11.640 --> 00:34:13.280]   She's engaged in massive fraud.
[00:34:13.280 --> 00:34:15.040]   These people are crazy.
[00:34:15.040 --> 00:34:16.880]   They're crazy.
[00:34:18.400 --> 00:34:22.680]   But it's just like DC where Obama goes, my God,
[00:34:22.680 --> 00:34:25.320]   looks like he's going to win the nomination, start spying on him.
[00:34:25.320 --> 00:34:26.720]   My gosh, he won.
[00:34:26.720 --> 00:34:30.800]   Spy on him even more, find something on him, make something up,
[00:34:30.800 --> 00:34:36.560]   create fake dossiers with the Russians to then set Trump up further and
[00:34:36.560 --> 00:34:38.440]   then harass everybody including myself.
[00:34:38.440 --> 00:34:43.760]   They use the pretext to go after me with federal dollars that Obama assigned in
[00:34:43.760 --> 00:34:49.080]   the Defense Authorization Act of 2016 into 17.
[00:34:49.080 --> 00:34:54.400]   To go after myself and others in the independent press that support Trump
[00:34:54.400 --> 00:34:59.080]   with the excuse saying we're connected to Russians with no evidence.
[00:34:59.080 --> 00:35:05.080]   And then that's what I'm still enjoying the tail end of,
[00:35:05.080 --> 00:35:11.560]   is CIA Defense Department funding to destroy myself and my family.
[00:35:11.560 --> 00:35:16.440]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:35:16.440 --> 00:35:20.600]   Yeah, they put an article up from 2012 back when Obama first started that type
[00:35:20.600 --> 00:35:23.400]   of stuff, but you can pull up the Zero Edge articles,
[00:35:23.400 --> 00:35:27.000]   the best one about the Obama creates his own ministry of truth.
[00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:30.480]   Counter disinformation and propaganda act into law.
[00:35:30.480 --> 00:35:35.360]   The reason I talk about this every day is that's the instrument
[00:35:35.360 --> 00:35:40.040]   through which I have been tortured.
[00:35:42.040 --> 00:35:47.240]   But not as bad as Roger Stone who's being railroaded and can't speak.
[00:35:47.240 --> 00:35:49.680]   Not as bad as Paul Manafort.
[00:35:49.680 --> 00:35:52.960]   Not as bad as Carter Page.
[00:35:52.960 --> 00:35:54.320]   Not as bad as the Trump family.
[00:35:54.320 --> 00:36:00.520]   All of them have had giant magnifying glasses put on them, incredible lies.
[00:36:00.520 --> 00:36:01.600]   It has been hell.
[00:36:01.600 --> 00:36:04.480]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:36:04.480 --> 00:36:08.600]   And justice states that they need to get in trouble for
[00:36:08.600 --> 00:36:15.080]   what they have done, because it's been rough.
[00:36:15.080 --> 00:36:19.360]   And the IRS got away with persecuting over 10,000 conservative groups,
[00:36:19.360 --> 00:36:21.440]   over 100,000 conservatives.
[00:36:21.440 --> 00:36:26.040]   And I don't forget watching MSNBC like ten years ago, it made me so mad.
[00:36:26.040 --> 00:36:28.000]   That's when I went, wow, they're consciously evil.
[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:29.840]   I was so naive back then.
[00:36:29.840 --> 00:36:32.120]   I thought some of them just believed their own bull.
[00:36:32.120 --> 00:36:35.840]   And they go, of course we're auditing and arresting members of the Tea Party.
[00:36:35.840 --> 00:36:37.480]   They deserve to be shut down.
[00:36:37.480 --> 00:36:38.920]   They're racist.
[00:36:38.920 --> 00:36:41.160]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:36:41.160 --> 00:36:46.320]   Just because you're pro-free market and like America, and don't hate the police
[00:36:46.320 --> 00:36:50.160]   and like the military and like the trains arriving on time.
[00:36:50.160 --> 00:36:53.800]   Just because you're not out to get the country and
[00:36:53.800 --> 00:36:59.520]   don't want the IRS persecuting everybody, well, you need to go to jail.
[00:36:59.520 --> 00:37:05.160]   And so now it's, hey, let's turn the CIA loose on people.
[00:37:05.160 --> 00:37:08.800]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:37:08.800 --> 00:37:12.320]   See how Trump's supporters like that?
[00:37:12.320 --> 00:37:17.920]   because it hadn't just been me, let me tell you, it's been rough for everybody.
[00:37:17.920 --> 00:37:21.360]   It's been rough for Sean Hannity.
[00:37:21.360 --> 00:37:24.560]   It's been rough for Tucker Carlson.
[00:37:24.560 --> 00:37:27.920]   It's been rough for basically anybody you can imagine.
[00:37:27.920 --> 00:37:29.640]   And guess what it did to all those people?
[00:37:29.640 --> 00:37:32.200]   It didn't make them back down.
[00:37:32.200 --> 00:37:34.680]   It didn't make them shut up.
[00:37:34.680 --> 00:37:36.720]   It radicalized them.
[00:37:36.720 --> 00:37:39.240]   And now you got a bunch of Alex Jones's on your hands.
[00:37:39.240 --> 00:37:40.760]   [LAUGH]
[00:37:40.760 --> 00:37:44.000]   That didn't work like you thought it would, you authoritarian jerks.
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:47.040]   Because if people come after you, you back down.
[00:37:47.040 --> 00:37:48.520]   You keep your head down.
[00:37:48.520 --> 00:37:51.120]   We don't do that.
[00:37:51.120 --> 00:37:53.280]   And so I've had my issues with some of the mainline conservatives.
[00:37:53.280 --> 00:37:55.600]   They're not mainline conservatives anymore.
[00:37:55.600 --> 00:37:56.720]   They're Americans.
[00:37:56.720 --> 00:37:57.760]   They're Americana.
[00:37:57.760 --> 00:38:00.240]   They're 1776ers.
[00:38:00.240 --> 00:38:02.440]   They're 3%ers back from the dead.
[00:38:02.440 --> 00:38:05.800]   That's what this is.
[00:38:05.800 --> 00:38:07.680]   You think I'm looking for some big fight with the globalists?
[00:38:07.680 --> 00:38:09.400]   You think I like to be pigheaded and do all this?
[00:38:09.400 --> 00:38:13.240]   No, but they're bad people and we can't back down.
[00:38:13.240 --> 00:38:15.560]   And their intimidation has the opposite effect on me.
[00:38:15.560 --> 00:38:18.760]   Sometimes I can be really tired and exhausted, even have a cold,
[00:38:18.760 --> 00:38:19.320]   have a fever.
[00:38:19.320 --> 00:38:23.680]   And then they try to run me down and try to crush me and my family and
[00:38:23.680 --> 00:38:26.640]   my country and all of a sudden, my fever goes away.
[00:38:26.640 --> 00:38:31.160]   I mean, I can literally will a fever to go away if I'm pissed off.
[00:38:33.160 --> 00:38:34.800]   All I gotta do is think about my kids.
[00:38:34.800 --> 00:38:40.160]   And I can literally be throwing up and just turn it off.
[00:38:40.160 --> 00:38:45.640]   And anybody could do that if you get focused and go through the fear and
[00:38:45.640 --> 00:38:49.080]   stop giving into these damn globalists and their intimidation.
[00:38:49.080 --> 00:38:50.560]   So what if they attack us?
[00:38:50.560 --> 00:38:52.000]   So what if they lie about us?
[00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:53.520]   They're the criminals, not us.
[00:38:53.520 --> 00:38:58.640]   There have been over 100 articles in the last day saying that I made this poor
[00:38:58.640 --> 00:39:02.840]   Sandy Hook father, a neuroscientist, commit suicide.
[00:39:02.840 --> 00:39:05.160]   And they are very deceptive.
[00:39:05.160 --> 00:39:09.240]   They do things like the Monday morning they were saying he's dead from
[00:39:09.240 --> 00:39:11.280]   a gunshot wound, we don't know.
[00:39:11.280 --> 00:39:14.000]   And I'm reading the first articles, well, we don't know,
[00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:15.440]   is this gonna be investigated?
[00:39:15.440 --> 00:39:17.640]   And then later they go, apparent suicide.
[00:39:17.640 --> 00:39:20.720]   But by law, you still investigate that, that's why there's a corner.
[00:39:20.720 --> 00:39:23.880]   They spun that that Jones spins new conspiracy theory,
[00:39:23.880 --> 00:39:26.720]   weaves new conspiracy theory, and then they say,
[00:39:26.720 --> 00:39:30.600]   weaves new conspiracy theory, and says that somebody killed this guy.
[00:39:30.600 --> 00:39:31.360]   I didn't say that.
[00:39:31.360 --> 00:39:36.440]   And then, let's play this clip, then I'll play the president.
[00:39:36.440 --> 00:39:39.360]   Connecticut Senator condemns Alex Jones.
[00:39:39.360 --> 00:39:45.800]   And see, notice, since people gave in to me being censored, Facebook, Google,
[00:39:45.800 --> 00:39:47.480]   at school shooting victim suicide.
[00:39:47.480 --> 00:39:54.640]   You notice the latest thing from the Georgetown free speech clinic
[00:39:54.640 --> 00:39:57.200]   that's suing me, trying to shut down the First Amendment.
[00:39:57.200 --> 00:40:01.080]   They're now saying they're gonna sue Google because a father of the newscaster
[00:40:01.080 --> 00:40:06.120]   that got shot a few years ago on tape, he says, other people keep uploading it.
[00:40:06.120 --> 00:40:09.760]   Well, they take it down, but other people keep uploading it, it's whack a mole.
[00:40:09.760 --> 00:40:11.200]   How is that their fault?
[00:40:11.200 --> 00:40:13.200]   You're trying to get rid of Section 230.
[00:40:13.200 --> 00:40:16.000]   And Google and others have been giving in to you,
[00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:18.280]   getting rid of their own Section 230, they're being set up.
[00:40:18.280 --> 00:40:23.160]   Just like the EU just got rid of Section 230.
[00:40:23.160 --> 00:40:26.640]   They just passed a law to get rid of Section 230 yesterday,
[00:40:26.640 --> 00:40:31.040]   which will end the Internet as we know it.
[00:40:31.040 --> 00:40:34.840]   And big tech has walked right into the trap.
[00:40:34.840 --> 00:40:38.120]   And so because they didn't defend me from the establishment and
[00:40:38.120 --> 00:40:41.760]   old dying media that's in a coalition to make big tech do what they want.
[00:40:41.760 --> 00:40:44.760]   Because you didn't defend me, well, I was domino number one, dumbass.
[00:40:44.760 --> 00:40:47.880]   And now it's you, big tech.
[00:40:47.880 --> 00:40:51.040]   Now they're coming for you.
[00:40:51.040 --> 00:40:55.240]   And then they say that it's our fault this guy committed suicide.
[00:40:55.240 --> 00:40:59.840]   It's the mainstream media bringing up all the dead kids constantly saying we say
[00:40:59.840 --> 00:41:03.840]   they didn't die, constantly saying Sandy Hook, constantly calling the parents,
[00:41:03.840 --> 00:41:05.640]   constantly trying to go get interviews with them.
[00:41:05.640 --> 00:41:06.880]   I've never been to Connecticut.
[00:41:06.880 --> 00:41:08.360]   I've never sent investigators there.
[00:41:08.360 --> 00:41:10.400]   I've never tried to get them to come talk to me.
[00:41:10.400 --> 00:41:11.880]   I've said for years I thought it happened.
[00:41:11.880 --> 00:41:15.400]   But in my name, you keep terrorizing the parents.
[00:41:15.400 --> 00:41:19.640]   So that when they commit suicide, you can blame me.
[00:41:21.640 --> 00:41:23.560]   But see, that's the cost of freedom.
[00:41:23.560 --> 00:41:27.080]   We got to deal with this level of Democrat, Senator Chris Murphy,
[00:41:27.080 --> 00:41:32.720]   literally all over different TV channels saying this, here it is.
[00:41:32.720 --> 00:41:37.320]   >> Well, listen, I'll use his name.
[00:41:37.320 --> 00:41:39.320]   We're talking about Alex Jones.
[00:41:39.320 --> 00:41:43.480]   And the fact of the matter is that the companies that allow people like him,
[00:41:43.480 --> 00:41:48.440]   conspiracy theorists, to be able to purvey lies have a responsibility.
[00:41:48.440 --> 00:41:53.120]   There is no constitutional duty on an Internet company to allow somebody to
[00:41:53.120 --> 00:41:58.480]   terrorize parents of mass tragedies like Alex Jones did for so long.
[00:41:58.480 --> 00:42:03.120]   The Newtown families are proceeding with a court case to try to hold him
[00:42:03.120 --> 00:42:04.320]   accountable.
[00:42:04.320 --> 00:42:07.440]   But the companies that allow for this nonsense,
[00:42:07.440 --> 00:42:12.360]   this garbage to be spread out over the Internet, have a responsibility and
[00:42:12.360 --> 00:42:17.840]   a duty themselves to do something earlier than they did in the case of InfoWars.
[00:42:18.600 --> 00:42:21.480]   So they want the president like New Zealand to just shut all speech down.
[00:42:21.480 --> 00:42:25.520]   Babies in incubators didn't happen, launched a war that killed millions.
[00:42:25.520 --> 00:42:28.960]   Schmollett didn't happen, WMDs didn't happen.
[00:42:28.960 --> 00:42:32.040]   This whole lie about the Russiagate didn't happen.
[00:42:32.040 --> 00:42:36.240]   The women have said it's fake, almost all of them, Kavanaugh,
[00:42:36.240 --> 00:42:37.720]   they never met Kavanaugh.
[00:42:37.720 --> 00:42:41.840]   But because you guys lie so much, we're not allowed to even question.
[00:42:41.840 --> 00:42:46.040]   That's what you're really saying, you un-American dirtbag, Chris Murphy.
[00:42:47.600 --> 00:42:51.160]   That's all this is, is they want us shut down and
[00:42:51.160 --> 00:42:54.000]   they're scared because they know they don't have a real case.
[00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:55.840]   They want to try it in the court of public opinion.
[00:42:55.840 --> 00:42:57.320]   We'll be back with your phone call, stay with us.
[00:42:57.320 --> 00:43:03.240]   >> Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[00:43:03.240 --> 00:43:06.520]   The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates.
[00:43:06.520 --> 00:43:09.440]   But a lot of us on the big island rely on rainwater, and
[00:43:09.440 --> 00:43:12.760]   we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[00:43:12.760 --> 00:43:16.440]   Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles, and
[00:43:16.440 --> 00:43:20.120]   acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels.
[00:43:20.120 --> 00:43:26.600]   To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[00:43:26.600 --> 00:43:30.280]   What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and
[00:43:30.280 --> 00:43:32.320]   acidity in the rainwater.
[00:43:32.320 --> 00:43:36.240]   Next, we tested the water from our AlexaPure gravity filter.
[00:43:36.240 --> 00:43:39.920]   And not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure, but
[00:43:39.920 --> 00:43:43.400]   the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[00:43:43.400 --> 00:43:48.680]   As it turns out, the filter on the AlexaPure raises the pH of the water.
[00:43:48.680 --> 00:43:51.080]   So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and
[00:43:51.080 --> 00:43:54.320]   acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[00:43:54.320 --> 00:43:59.400]   But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[00:43:59.400 --> 00:44:00.880]   >> Our grandparents, the great grandparents,
[00:44:00.880 --> 00:44:04.080]   knew that they canned food during the fall so they'd have it during the winter.
[00:44:04.080 --> 00:44:08.400]   And that's what I'm talking about at mfortworthstore.com.
[00:44:08.400 --> 00:44:12.480]   With mfortworth select, it's the full spectrum of my patron's supply,

[00:44:15.360 --> 00:44:20.640]   But because I private label it, I'm able to go below cost on contracts
[00:44:20.640 --> 00:44:23.160]   that all their other distributors aren't able to do.
[00:44:23.160 --> 00:44:27.080]   But I want to be a market leader, and I want you to have storable food, so
[00:44:27.080 --> 00:44:28.520]   it's a total win-win.

[00:44:41.960 --> 00:44:43.480]   Maybe you got a three year supply.
[00:44:43.480 --> 00:44:45.480]   If stuff happens, you can feed your whole block.
[00:44:45.480 --> 00:44:48.040]   It's up to us to be self-sufficient.
[00:44:48.040 --> 00:44:50.440]   You're buying War Bonds, bringing great products, and

[00:45:02.680 --> 00:45:04.880]   >> Yeah, I just have to say something, man.
[00:45:04.880 --> 00:45:08.720]   It seems like every time I turn on your broadcast, you're bragging.
[00:45:08.720 --> 00:45:10.200]   It just gets old, man.
[00:45:10.200 --> 00:45:12.600]   I'm going to shut you down right now, okay?
[00:45:12.600 --> 00:45:14.920]   We're taking calls about your nomination.
[00:45:14.920 --> 00:45:17.840]   Do you understand they're having congressional hearings,
[00:45:17.840 --> 00:45:19.480]   trying to shut us down?
[00:45:19.480 --> 00:45:22.080]   Do you understand I'm ringing the alarm?
[00:45:22.080 --> 00:45:24.920]   If that was happening to anybody else, I'd be freaked out.
[00:45:24.920 --> 00:45:27.400]   I mean, what's it going to take, us being shut down?
[00:45:27.400 --> 00:45:28.880]   Is that what you want, Frank?
[00:45:28.880 --> 00:45:31.280]   >> You know what, Alex- >> Put him on pause again.
[00:45:31.280 --> 00:45:34.080]   Hey, Frank, do you understand it's not bragging to say,
[00:45:34.080 --> 00:45:37.760]   we are the tip of the spear, we're under attack, we need your help.
[00:45:37.760 --> 00:45:41.080]   As much bagging as I do, we can barely pay the bills and
[00:45:41.080 --> 00:45:42.280]   grow in the face of this.
[00:45:42.280 --> 00:45:45.440]   I'm not going to just stop growth and let them start pushing us backwards.
[00:45:45.440 --> 00:45:47.520]   You understand, I need your help, Frank.
[00:45:47.520 --> 00:45:48.720]   I need your help, Frank.
[00:45:48.720 --> 00:45:55.320]   >> Go to infowarsstore.com right now and help fund the InfoWars.

[00:45:59.160 --> 00:46:02.960]   >> There are thousands of ideologies out there,
[00:46:02.960 --> 00:46:05.080]   hundreds of different political systems, and
[00:46:05.080 --> 00:46:06.640]   most of them are funded by the globalists.
[00:46:07.840 --> 00:46:11.240]   InfoWars is truly the tip of the spear of the zeitgeist.
[00:46:11.240 --> 00:46:14.280]   That's why the globalists are obsessed with it, trying to shut it down.
[00:46:14.280 --> 00:46:15.880]   I didn't invent all this.
[00:46:15.880 --> 00:46:18.480]   I went and researched the Renaissance, Americana, and
[00:46:18.480 --> 00:46:20.520]   what really works for humanity.
[00:46:20.520 --> 00:46:22.440]   And I'm simply trying to bring it back.
[00:46:22.440 --> 00:46:25.320]   And lo and behold, it's super popular like it's always been.
[00:46:25.320 --> 00:46:29.640]   That's why the globalists are trying to shut it down so desperately.
[00:46:29.640 --> 00:46:34.280]   Because we have the light in the dark of the night that sends chills up my spine.
[00:46:34.280 --> 00:46:38.280]   >> So whatever you do, continue to support yourself and InfoWars by buying
[00:46:38.280 --> 00:46:41.200]   the great products at infowarsstore.com, by spreading the articles,
[00:46:41.200 --> 00:46:44.240]   by spreading the videos, and by praying for this operation and for
[00:46:44.240 --> 00:46:47.800]   praying for this nation and the world for peace and discernment.
[00:46:47.800 --> 00:46:51.480]   For myself and the whole InfoWars family, I wanna thank all of you for
[00:46:51.480 --> 00:46:55.640]   what you've done, because without you, InfoWars is nothing.
[00:46:55.640 --> 00:46:58.120]   You are the InfoWars, and I salute you.

[00:47:43.680 --> 00:47:53.680]   >> Thank you, Waylon Jennings.
[00:47:53.680 --> 00:47:58.680]   [MUSIC]
[00:47:58.680 --> 00:48:01.680]   I'm not named Robin, but I am good friends, pretty good friends with his son.
[00:48:01.680 --> 00:48:06.680]   Old Shooter's offended me against censorship, appreciate that, Shooter.
[00:48:06.680 --> 00:48:08.680]   [MUSIC]
[00:48:08.680 --> 00:48:12.680]   By the way, usually the son isn't as good as the father, but
[00:48:12.680 --> 00:48:16.680]   Shooter is as good as his dad, but even wider range of types of music.
[00:48:16.680 --> 00:48:20.680]   But you see that with old Hank Williams Jr., too.
[00:48:20.680 --> 00:48:25.680]   Those old apples didn't fall too far from that dirt tree.
[00:48:25.680 --> 00:48:27.680]   [MUSIC]
[00:48:27.680 --> 00:48:30.680]   I think the globalists have figured out, too, their attacks on us,
[00:48:30.680 --> 00:48:32.680]   their attacks on me are an attack on you.
[00:48:32.680 --> 00:48:35.680]   I'm not just saying that for solidarity, that's the damn truth.
[00:48:35.680 --> 00:48:38.680]   Is that they got a tiger by the tail, it's plain to see.
[00:48:38.680 --> 00:48:43.680]   And that's the thing about, I like cats, I like dogs better, but my wife's got a cat,
[00:48:43.680 --> 00:48:46.680]   and one of my daughters wanted a cat.
[00:48:46.680 --> 00:48:49.680]   And they're both males, and they started fighting.
[00:48:49.680 --> 00:48:52.680]   And usually they fight every once in a while at nights when it happens,
[00:48:52.680 --> 00:48:54.680]   over a little bit of food left in the dish or something.
[00:48:54.680 --> 00:48:56.680]   They're both fat, that's all they do is beg for food.
[00:48:56.680 --> 00:49:01.680]   Two fat tabbies, two Garfields, and I went to separate them.
[00:49:01.680 --> 00:49:07.680]   And the younger one still jumped on the older one that's like 14 pounds,
[00:49:07.680 --> 00:49:08.680]   gigantic tabby.
[00:49:08.680 --> 00:49:12.680]   It tore the hell out of my arm, just with its back claws getting away.
[00:49:12.680 --> 00:49:16.680]   And could you imagine actually having a tiger by the tail?
[00:49:16.680 --> 00:49:21.680]   Didn't really hurt, though, and I walk in the bathroom,
[00:49:21.680 --> 00:49:23.680]   there's just blood just spilling out of my arm.
[00:49:23.680 --> 00:49:26.680]   People always ask, what is that, self-harming?
[00:49:26.680 --> 00:49:28.680]   Some form of like native art?
[00:49:28.680 --> 00:49:31.680]   No, it's what a 14-pound Garfield does to you.
[00:49:31.680 --> 00:49:35.680]   So I couldn't imagine having a real tiger by the tail.
[00:49:35.680 --> 00:49:39.680]   I guess the role of video is some crazy person that's got a tiger by the tail.
[00:49:39.680 --> 00:49:46.680]   Look, I'm going to go to John and Reagan and Kelvin and Lee and Jeff and Alden
[00:49:46.680 --> 00:49:49.680]   and Aaron and Jefferson and Johnny as soon as we start the next hour.
[00:49:49.680 --> 00:49:54.680]   And I'm a little bit behind on a lot of things here that are really, really important.
[00:49:54.680 --> 00:49:58.680]   Faith Goldie, beautiful, smart, amazing.
[00:49:58.680 --> 00:50:03.680]   She got beat up by leftists yesterday.
[00:50:03.680 --> 00:50:04.680]   We're going to show you that photo.
[00:50:04.680 --> 00:50:05.680]   She's going to join us.
[00:50:05.680 --> 00:50:07.680]   Mike Adams is going to be in the studio.
[00:50:07.680 --> 00:50:12.680]   So you definitely don't want to miss that on a host of issues.
[00:50:12.680 --> 00:50:16.680]   And then Mike Adams will be hosting the fourth hour.
[00:50:16.680 --> 00:50:23.680]   So, again, you do not want to miss any of that important information today.
[00:50:23.680 --> 00:50:26.680]   That is going to be absolutely critical.
[00:50:26.680 --> 00:50:32.680]   And I do intend to have the phones open throughout that entire period of transmission.
[00:50:32.680 --> 00:50:37.680]   [Pause for response]
[00:50:37.680 --> 00:50:42.680]   The latest news I got -- here's my problem.
[00:50:42.680 --> 00:50:46.680]   I don't like the news being about me.
[00:50:46.680 --> 00:50:57.680]   I'd rather be it about our successes like, oh, look, another country just got out of the clutches of communism or socialism or fascism or authoritarianism
[00:50:57.680 --> 00:51:02.680]   and became a capitalist, prosperous nation on the path to success.
[00:51:02.680 --> 00:51:06.680]   I'd rather be reporting on things like that.
[00:51:06.680 --> 00:51:10.680]   But in this weird universe, they have made me front and center.
[00:51:10.680 --> 00:51:15.680]   And just in the last few minutes, more articles have come out.
[00:51:15.680 --> 00:51:19.680]   I mean, I can't even keep track of this anymore.
[00:51:19.680 --> 00:51:23.680]   So let me just reset here for a moment.
[00:51:23.680 --> 00:51:24.680]   You know what?
[00:51:24.680 --> 00:51:26.680]   I need a second before I get into this.
[00:51:26.680 --> 00:51:28.680]   And I said I'd play this in the first and second segment.
[00:51:28.680 --> 00:51:29.680]   I didn't.
[00:51:29.680 --> 00:51:37.680]   It's pretty big news, the president pointing out that, of course, it's Obama that directed the national security investigation of the Trump campaign and tried to meddle in the election.
[00:51:37.680 --> 00:51:38.680]   It wasn't the Russians.
[00:51:38.680 --> 00:51:39.680]   It was the Democratic Party.
[00:51:39.680 --> 00:51:43.680]   And now they tried to overturn for two and a half years a Democratic elected president.
[00:51:43.680 --> 00:51:44.680]   The voters will.
[00:51:44.680 --> 00:51:45.680]   And it is treason.
[00:51:45.680 --> 00:51:47.680]   The president also said that two days ago.
[00:51:47.680 --> 00:51:50.680]   But yesterday, he got asked about who's behind this.
[00:51:50.680 --> 00:51:51.680]   And obviously, it is Obama.
[00:51:51.680 --> 00:51:52.680]   Here it is.
[00:51:52.680 --> 00:51:56.680]   I don't think there's ever been a better impeachment.
[00:51:56.680 --> 00:51:58.680]   We have the greatest economy we've ever had.
[00:51:58.680 --> 00:52:01.680]   Our country is in incredible shape.
[00:52:01.680 --> 00:52:09.680]   They and others created a fraud on our country with this ridiculous way where it was proven very strongly.
[00:52:09.680 --> 00:52:13.680]   No collusion, no obstruction, no nothing.
[00:52:13.680 --> 00:52:15.680]   We are doing so well.
[00:52:15.680 --> 00:52:18.680]   We've never probably had a time of prosperity like this.
[00:52:18.680 --> 00:52:19.680]   It's been great.
[00:52:19.680 --> 00:52:30.680]   >> The people who want the investigation in New York in the name of treasonous acts, how high up do you think you went?
[00:52:30.680 --> 00:52:31.680]   >> I think it was very high up.
[00:52:31.680 --> 00:52:33.680]   I think what happened is a disgrace.
[00:52:33.680 --> 00:52:37.680]   I don't believe our country should allow this ever to happen again.
[00:52:37.680 --> 00:52:38.680]   This will never happen again.
[00:52:38.680 --> 00:52:41.680]   We cannot let it ever happen again.
[00:52:41.680 --> 00:52:44.680]   It went very high up and it started fairly low.
[00:52:44.680 --> 00:52:51.680]   But with instructions from the high up, this should never happen to a president again.
[00:52:51.680 --> 00:52:53.680]   We can't allow that to take place.
[00:52:53.680 --> 00:52:58.680]   >> [INAUDIBLE]
[00:52:58.680 --> 00:53:00.680]   >> I don't want to say that, but I think you know the answer.
[00:53:00.680 --> 00:53:03.680]   >> [INAUDIBLE]
[00:53:03.680 --> 00:53:05.680]   >> The report says, while you did not commit a crime.
[00:53:05.680 --> 00:53:06.680]   >> Who said what?
[00:53:06.680 --> 00:53:09.680]   >> The Mueller report said, according to the Department of Homeland Security.
[00:53:09.680 --> 00:53:11.680]   >> The Mueller report was great.
[00:53:11.680 --> 00:53:13.680]   It could not have been better.
[00:53:13.680 --> 00:53:16.680]   It said no obstruction, no collusion.
[00:53:16.680 --> 00:53:18.680]   It could not have been better.
[00:53:18.680 --> 00:53:22.680]   >> Think about this.
[00:53:22.680 --> 00:53:32.680]   In just the last few months, we've seen the majority of the women that said that Chief Justice, start over.
[00:53:32.680 --> 00:53:35.680]   There's so many points I want to make here.
[00:53:35.680 --> 00:53:45.680]   In just the last few months, we've seen Justice Kavanaugh vindicated.
[00:53:45.680 --> 00:53:49.680]   And the majority of women that came out and said that he raped them said that they never met him.
[00:53:49.680 --> 00:53:55.680]   We've seen Jussie Smollett caught red handed and open and shut case, staging the attack on himself.
[00:53:55.680 --> 00:54:07.680]   My God, it's just so incredible, isn't it?
[00:54:07.680 --> 00:54:08.680]   Well, I'll just get to it later.
[00:54:08.680 --> 00:54:09.680]   I'll just cover it later.
[00:54:09.680 --> 00:54:10.680]   I'm going to go to your phone calls.
[00:54:10.680 --> 00:54:19.680]   I try hard.
[00:54:19.680 --> 00:54:21.680]   I don't feel sorry for myself, but I try hard.
[00:54:21.680 --> 00:54:26.680]   It's that there's no attention span anymore.
[00:54:26.680 --> 00:54:27.680]   People don't have memories.
[00:54:27.680 --> 00:54:28.680]   It's frightening.
[00:54:28.680 --> 00:54:31.680]   Nobody has memories anymore.
[00:54:31.680 --> 00:54:34.680]   Or any type of good memory.
[00:54:34.680 --> 00:54:37.680]   The hell of mine is not what it used to be.
[00:54:37.680 --> 00:54:38.680]   It used to be photographic.
[00:54:38.680 --> 00:54:41.680]   But I'll try to lay it out again later.
[00:54:41.680 --> 00:54:42.680]   Maybe.
[00:54:42.680 --> 00:54:43.680]   I'll try again later.
[00:54:43.680 --> 00:54:48.680]   But the point is, is that we've seen a lot of lying by the establishment.
[00:54:48.680 --> 00:54:51.680]   A lot of bad things they've done.
[00:54:51.680 --> 00:54:57.680]   And the good news is that the people see through it.
[00:54:57.680 --> 00:55:00.680]   And if you look at the different compilations that are out there, we'll show you one from
[00:55:00.680 --> 00:55:02.680]   DrudgeReport.com here in a moment.
[00:55:02.680 --> 00:55:08.680]   The different compilations that are out there of the Democrats saying that Trump was a Russian agent,
[00:55:08.680 --> 00:55:12.680]   a traitor, he was going to go to jail, and all the supporters were really Russian agents.
[00:55:12.680 --> 00:55:15.680]   He didn't win the election and treason had been committed.
[00:55:15.680 --> 00:55:22.680]   And then how they're having to respond to it later, we can put it up on screen, DrudgeReport.com.
[00:55:22.680 --> 00:55:29.680]   You can see the middle column compilation that Darren McBrain put together there on the site.
[00:55:29.680 --> 00:55:37.680]   Russia fail ultimate media compilation.
[00:55:37.680 --> 00:55:39.680]   You can see it at Infowars.com.
[00:55:39.680 --> 00:55:42.680]   Watch the ultimate Russiagate hoax compilation.
[00:55:42.680 --> 00:55:44.680]   I like Drudge's headline better.
[00:55:44.680 --> 00:55:46.680]   I'm going to change ours to Drudge's headline.
[00:55:46.680 --> 00:55:48.680]   So great job, Drudge, for that.
[00:55:48.680 --> 00:55:52.680]   Thank you so much.
[00:55:52.680 --> 00:55:55.680]   You know, sometimes I do this on air.
[00:55:55.680 --> 00:55:57.680]   Usually the show is teleprompter free.
[00:55:57.680 --> 00:56:02.680]   It's always teleprompter free, but I get distracted by what gets put on screen because they're
[00:56:02.680 --> 00:56:04.680]   throwing up stuff to go along with what I'm saying.
[00:56:04.680 --> 00:56:08.680]   They're just doing random searches, and then I kind of can't help but read what's on it.
[00:56:08.680 --> 00:56:13.680]   But there's a film being put out about all the hoaxes the media has put out, and they
[00:56:13.680 --> 00:56:16.680]   want a three-minute clip of me talking about them all.
[00:56:16.680 --> 00:56:18.680]   I don't have a script.
[00:56:18.680 --> 00:56:25.680]   And so I was going to try this segment just to do the three minutes live, rattling off
[00:56:25.680 --> 00:56:29.680]   just some of the massive hoaxes in the last few years that mainstream media and the Democrats
[00:56:29.680 --> 00:56:33.680]   put out, and it gives me a headache to try to just think of them all or line them all
[00:56:33.680 --> 00:56:35.680]   up in my head.
[00:56:35.680 --> 00:56:40.680]   And then all they asked for was that there not be any graphics or any other B-roll while
[00:56:40.680 --> 00:56:43.680]   I did that so they could add the B-roll themselves.
[00:56:43.680 --> 00:56:44.680]   I probably wasn't clear with the crew.
[00:56:44.680 --> 00:56:47.680]   That's why I was like, "Okay, now let's start and wait.
[00:56:47.680 --> 00:56:48.680]   Let's stop."
[00:56:48.680 --> 00:56:53.680]   Because usually the show is not scripted like Fox News or CNN or most radio shows, which
[00:56:53.680 --> 00:56:54.680]   is fine.
[00:56:54.680 --> 00:56:57.680]   People need to script things out so they're more cohesive and coherent.
[00:56:57.680 --> 00:57:04.680]   It's just that I tend to be so busy that I tend to double down and do multiple things
[00:57:04.680 --> 00:57:08.680]   at one time and even direct my own show live from the chair, which nobody else in their
[00:57:08.680 --> 00:57:10.680]   right mind would do.
[00:57:10.680 --> 00:57:11.680]   So it's an extremely stressful job.
[00:57:11.680 --> 00:57:12.680]   I'm not bitching.
[00:57:12.680 --> 00:57:13.680]   I'm not complaining.
[00:57:13.680 --> 00:57:16.680]   Just please remember, if you want to keep hearing this show on air, pray for us.
[00:57:16.680 --> 00:57:18.680]   We're praying for you.
[00:57:18.680 --> 00:57:20.680]   Support our local affiliates.
[00:57:20.680 --> 00:57:21.680]   Support their sponsors.
[00:57:21.680 --> 00:57:22.680]   Let them know you support it.
[00:57:22.680 --> 00:57:23.680]   And it's really been helping.
[00:57:23.680 --> 00:57:24.680]   We're getting a lot of new affiliates.
[00:57:24.680 --> 00:57:25.680]   A lot of shows have us on.
[00:57:25.680 --> 00:57:26.680]   Stations have us on late at night.
[00:57:26.680 --> 00:57:28.680]   Now they move us into primetime.
[00:57:28.680 --> 00:57:29.680]   Just keep doing that.
[00:57:29.680 --> 00:57:30.680]   You're doing a great job.
[00:57:30.680 --> 00:57:34.680]   And please don't forget, store-wide free shipping and the biggest sale ever, 50 to 60% off
[00:57:34.680 --> 00:57:35.680]   on all the supplements.
[00:57:35.680 --> 00:57:41.680]   But it's got to end because a bunch of things like the fish oil and even X2 and even X3 and
[00:57:41.680 --> 00:57:47.680]   bodies and the bone broth and super silver wound gel are all very close to selling out.
[00:57:47.680 --> 00:57:58.680]   So those will be pulled soon.
[00:57:58.680 --> 00:58:05.440]   By leaps and by bounds, the number one bestselling supplement family in the world is energy
[00:58:05.440 --> 00:58:07.280]   drinks and energy supplements.
[00:58:07.280 --> 00:58:13.040]   But they are riddled with dyes and toxins and synthetic caffeines and other chemicals
[00:58:13.040 --> 00:58:17.240]   that sure get you a quick boost but burn out in just a few hours and have terrible side
[00:58:17.240 --> 00:58:18.240]   effects.
[00:58:18.240 --> 00:58:24.400]   We have developed, hands down from our research, the most powerful, healthy energy drink pre-workout
[00:58:24.400 --> 00:58:27.240]   and beyond system in the world.
[00:58:27.240 --> 00:58:28.240]   There's nothing else like it.
[00:58:28.240 --> 00:58:29.680]   You must experience it.
[00:58:29.680 --> 00:58:31.280]   It is a total game changer.
[00:58:31.280 --> 00:58:35.720]   And it comes in easy to use packets to mix in with fruit juice or water, whatever you'd
[00:58:35.720 --> 00:58:36.720]   like.
[00:58:36.720 --> 00:58:38.200]   Warning though, it's very, very strong.
[00:58:38.200 --> 00:58:39.200]   It lasts 10 hours.
[00:58:39.200 --> 00:58:43.560]   So take a half packet the first time you take it because Turbo Force is named Turbo Force
[00:58:43.560 --> 00:58:46.520]   because it will take you into overdrive.
[00:58:46.520 --> 00:58:49.160]   Turbo Force at InfoWarsLive.com.
[00:58:49.160 --> 00:58:55.960]   Do you realize that when you spread the links from InfoWars.com, when you spread the videos,
[00:58:55.960 --> 00:58:58.200]   you are changing the world?
[00:58:58.200 --> 00:59:01.920]   It's you that has defeated Hillary and the globalists.
[00:59:01.920 --> 00:59:06.480]   It is you, the info warriors across the planet that stood against the bullying, that stood
[00:59:06.480 --> 00:59:10.400]   against the peer pressure, that stood against the threats that have now changed the world.
[00:59:10.400 --> 00:59:15.240]   And that's why you've been on the team supporting us, praying for us and spreading the word.
[00:59:15.240 --> 00:59:16.680]   You are the InfoWar.
[00:59:16.680 --> 00:59:21.320]   And now because of their intensifying censorship, it's more important than ever that everyone
[00:59:21.320 --> 00:59:26.960]   go to InfoWars.com/newsletter and sign up via email so there's no way the censors can
[00:59:26.960 --> 00:59:32.280]   get between us with critical videos, articles, breaking news, intel, you name it.
[00:59:32.280 --> 00:59:37.840]   And so now I ask you more than ever to share the InfoWars.com articles, to share the videos,
[00:59:37.840 --> 00:59:40.200]   to tell people about the local stations you're listening to.
[00:59:40.200 --> 00:59:47.320]   The bare minimum you can do is sign up for the free newsletter at InfoWars.com/newsletter.
[00:59:47.320 --> 00:59:53.520]   We are the renaissance and we are winning.
[00:59:53.520 --> 01:00:03.720]   You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:03.720 --> 01:00:18.320]   He aligns himself with the truth.
[01:00:18.320 --> 01:00:21.840]   It's time for you to choose a side.
[01:00:21.840 --> 01:00:23.880]   You're listening to Alex Jones.
[01:00:23.880 --> 01:00:31.600]   Well, it was just last week that Bloomberg himself came out in Bloomberg, this media
[01:00:31.600 --> 01:00:41.040]   company and said, it's crazy how white people all go on TV, Beto O'Rourke, Joe Biden, and
[01:00:41.040 --> 01:00:43.440]   say white people are bad.
[01:00:43.440 --> 01:00:51.640]   Well, now Biden and others are saying that abusive women and rape is from Western culture.
[01:00:51.640 --> 01:00:58.080]   Any historian worth their salt will tell you that the West treats women the best.
[01:00:58.080 --> 01:01:02.120]   So that's coming up later in the hour, but it's up on InfoWars.com.
[01:01:02.120 --> 01:01:08.560]   And this is somebody trying to teach you that you suck.
[01:01:08.560 --> 01:01:12.080]   And if you did suck, it'd be good to know that because you can make it better.
[01:01:12.080 --> 01:01:21.560]   But you come from the country on average, from a group of countries on average that
[01:01:21.560 --> 01:01:23.760]   treat women the best.
[01:01:23.760 --> 01:01:30.160]   And so if you've got the best record, why would you then be told you're the problem?
[01:01:30.160 --> 01:01:36.720]   Because see, Biden's competing against that American system and he can't deal with it.
[01:01:36.720 --> 01:01:37.520]   He can't deal with it at all.
[01:01:37.520 --> 01:01:47.160]   Now, I'm gonna go to your phone calls right now.
[01:01:47.160 --> 01:01:50.480]   Really appreciate you calling in.
[01:01:50.480 --> 01:01:52.280]   We're talking about the waterfront here.
[01:01:52.280 --> 01:01:55.280]   But please introduce the topic that you wanna get into.
[01:01:55.280 --> 01:01:58.720]   We've got a lot of people here that are holding.
[01:01:58.720 --> 01:02:00.040]   Let's talk to John in Wyoming.
[01:02:00.040 --> 01:02:01.040]   John, you're on the air.
[01:02:01.040 --> 01:02:02.040]   Go ahead.
[01:02:02.040 --> 01:02:03.040]   >> Good morning, Alex.
[01:02:03.040 --> 01:02:04.040]   >> Welcome.
[01:02:04.040 --> 01:02:11.840]   >> On this Jesse Smollett case, first of all, that Kim Fox, that Cook County prosecutor,
[01:02:11.840 --> 01:02:19.120]   I would relabel her as a prostitutor because she is out there prostituting the law for
[01:02:19.120 --> 01:02:20.760]   the Obamas.
[01:02:20.760 --> 01:02:26.280]   Because Smollett was not only trying to enhance his career with this phony assault, he was
[01:02:26.280 --> 01:02:29.520]   trying to start a race war, period.
[01:02:29.520 --> 01:02:34.080]   And he claimed that his two attackers were white, which they were not.
[01:02:34.080 --> 01:02:40.080]   And then he claimed that they were hollering, "This is mega country," to again try to focus
[01:02:40.080 --> 01:02:46.760]   the blame or shift the blame on President Trump for a non-existent crime.
[01:02:46.760 --> 01:02:52.840]   So these people have no decency, no honor, no integrity.
[01:02:52.840 --> 01:02:54.960]   And they're going up there trying to...
[01:02:54.960 --> 01:02:59.400]   What would have happened if somebody would have believed his story and they would have
[01:02:59.400 --> 01:03:03.600]   started race riots in all the major cities like Chicago, New York?
[01:03:03.600 --> 01:03:04.880]   >> Well, you're totally on target.
[01:03:04.880 --> 01:03:10.320]   In fact, guys, will you print for me the article that came out in 2018 in January that no one
[01:03:10.320 --> 01:03:14.200]   ever countered, they never challenged it, cuz it's accurate documents, where the Democrats
[01:03:14.200 --> 01:03:23.580]   were planning to launch a race war off of all the Black Lives Matter movement with Soros
[01:03:23.580 --> 01:03:25.720]   and his son involved funding it.
[01:03:25.720 --> 01:03:27.440]   It's their own organization.
[01:03:27.440 --> 01:03:29.480]   And by the grace of God, it didn't ignite.
[01:03:29.480 --> 01:03:33.160]   But yeah, this is just another attempt at that.
[01:03:33.160 --> 01:03:39.560]   >> Well, see, I don't have any knowledge of that particular article, but I have the instincts
[01:03:39.560 --> 01:03:45.440]   that you do, that I've seen these people, I know how they work, I know how they operate.
[01:03:45.440 --> 01:03:51.240]   And what they're trying to do was to divide Americans, black and white, young and old,
[01:03:51.240 --> 01:03:52.240]   etc.
[01:03:52.240 --> 01:03:59.600]   They're trying to divide us so we will hate each other and we will start working to destroy
[01:03:59.600 --> 01:04:05.800]   each other's lives because these- >> I'll tell you what, stay there, stay there.
[01:04:05.800 --> 01:04:06.800]   We gotta go to break.
[01:04:06.800 --> 01:04:10.400]   I'm gonna come back, they're printing me the article, I'm gonna mention the article, get
[01:04:10.400 --> 01:04:13.600]   into Smollett and have you comment on it, because you're absolutely right.
[01:04:13.600 --> 01:04:18.360]   Smollett was an Obama attempt to start a race war, it failed.
[01:04:18.360 --> 01:04:22.440]   Now they've gotta protect him, because if it comes out, it goes all the way up to Obama,
[01:04:22.440 --> 01:04:26.120]   just like the fake Russiagate goes right back to Obama.
[01:04:26.120 --> 01:04:29.000]   You are absolutely correct.
[01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:36.640]   We'll be back to finish up with John, then Reagan, Kelvin, Lee, Jeff, Nathan, Alden,
[01:04:36.640 --> 01:04:41.160]   Aaron, Jefferson, Johnny, Chris, and others.
[01:04:41.160 --> 01:04:45.880]   Infowars.com, Newswars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, think about it.
[01:04:45.880 --> 01:04:49.200]   Camp of the Spear, enemy hates us, tomorrow's news today.
[01:04:49.200 --> 01:04:58.520]   Please spread those sites, nothing can stop you when you take action.
[01:04:58.520 --> 01:05:01.760]   >> Our grandparents, great grandparents, knew they canned food.
[01:05:01.760 --> 01:05:03.760]   During the falls, they'd have it during the winter.
[01:05:03.760 --> 01:05:07.520]   And that's what I'm talking about at Infowars.com.

[01:07:00.980 --> 01:07:01.980]   I want to be a market leader.
[01:07:01.980 --> 01:07:30.740]   I want to be a market leader.
[01:07:32.740 --> 01:07:34.500]   They went to all those hundreds of stores.
[01:07:34.500 --> 01:07:35.960]   They got the surveillance footage.
[01:07:35.960 --> 01:07:37.040]   They sat through it.
[01:07:37.040 --> 01:07:40.400]   They found it.
[01:07:40.400 --> 01:07:45.520]   And the whole thing got deep-sexed because it went back to Barack Hussein Obama.
[01:07:45.520 --> 01:07:53.060]   But even Rahm Emanuel has looked at the calculus, at the tea leaves, and even the former Obama
[01:07:53.060 --> 01:07:54.720]   minion says, "This is horrible.
[01:07:54.720 --> 01:07:55.720]   This is out of control.
[01:07:55.720 --> 01:07:56.720]   This will not stand.
[01:07:56.720 --> 01:07:58.260]   There will be federal charges."
[01:07:58.260 --> 01:08:07.340]   And I've got a whole stack here that I'm going to go through that shows this and details
[01:08:07.340 --> 01:08:23.460]   it how the prosecutor herself knowingly said that she'd recused herself when she hadn't
[01:08:23.460 --> 01:08:27.700]   recused herself.
[01:08:27.700 --> 01:08:31.420]   That's criminal to say you've recused yourself because she got caught with a text message
[01:08:31.420 --> 01:08:35.580]   saying, "Let him go," and all the rest of it, and then to actually not recuse yourself
[01:08:35.580 --> 01:08:41.020]   and then to drop charges even after a grand jury had indicted him on 13 counts.
[01:08:41.020 --> 01:08:43.260]   John in Wyoming, you just called in earlier.
[01:08:43.260 --> 01:08:45.860]   I held you over because I want you to recap what you were saying.
[01:08:45.860 --> 01:08:51.100]   This is a story from Infowars.com from January of last year.
[01:08:51.100 --> 01:08:55.140]   Documents tell plan for civil unrest and martial law in Baltimore, and it's all the admitted
[01:08:55.140 --> 01:09:01.980]   George Soros internal documents where they were working with local police and Democrats
[01:09:01.980 --> 01:09:08.260]   to stage attacks and attempt to get blacks to riot to trigger nationwide martial law
[01:09:08.260 --> 01:09:12.420]   to keep Obama in office.
[01:09:12.420 --> 01:09:20.820]   But it didn't work.
[01:09:20.820 --> 01:09:26.660]   It didn't work, so they now don't know what to do.
[01:09:26.660 --> 01:09:32.980]   So recap your whole point about this and where you see this going, John.
[01:09:32.980 --> 01:09:39.020]   Alex, what happens here is, remember all of these evil players like George Soros and the
[01:09:39.020 --> 01:09:44.380]   rest of these bums are members of the Council on Foreign Relations, period.
[01:09:44.380 --> 01:09:51.420]   Now Obama was never officially a CFR member, yet I counted well over 54 members of his
[01:09:51.420 --> 01:09:56.460]   administration who were CFR because CFR wised up.
[01:09:56.460 --> 01:10:03.540]   The last CFR president was Bill Clinton, and then they decided, "Well, here's what we do.
[01:10:03.540 --> 01:10:11.060]   We don't have them be a member of the CFR as president, but every one of their top high-level
[01:10:11.060 --> 01:10:16.300]   staff positions are going to be staffed by CFR cronies."
[01:10:16.300 --> 01:10:17.660]   And that's what happened here.
[01:10:17.660 --> 01:10:26.300]   In Barry Goldwater's wonderful 1979 book, With No Apologies, page 126, Goldwater warned
[01:10:26.300 --> 01:10:33.020]   us, "The CFR is the American branch of a society which originated in England.
[01:10:33.020 --> 01:10:38.740]   Internationalist in viewpoint, the CFR, along with the Atlantic Union movement and the Atlantic
[01:10:38.740 --> 01:10:46.060]   Council of the United States, believes national boundaries should be obliterated and one world
[01:10:46.060 --> 01:10:47.500]   rule established."
[01:10:47.500 --> 01:10:48.500]   Period.
[01:10:48.500 --> 01:10:56.220]   Now, if you look at the CFR's membership, they'll show that Bill Clinton is a CFR member
[01:10:56.220 --> 01:11:03.700]   and has been for decades, and as of 2012, Chelsea Clinton became a CFR member, but guess
[01:11:03.700 --> 01:11:04.700]   what?
[01:11:04.700 --> 01:11:06.180]   Hillary is not a CFR member.
[01:11:06.180 --> 01:11:09.420]   They were expecting her to become president.
[01:11:09.420 --> 01:11:16.300]   Despite the fact that she speaks at the CFR all the time and is very cozy with the CFR,
[01:11:16.300 --> 01:11:21.620]   she is not officially a CFR member, and that's part of their subterfuge.
[01:11:21.620 --> 01:11:29.140]   They don't have their stooges, their puppets, like Barack Obama or Hillary Clinton in as
[01:11:29.140 --> 01:11:36.160]   CFR members, but all of their staff, all of their key-level cabinet posts are filled by
[01:11:36.160 --> 01:11:37.160]   CFR puppets.
[01:11:37.160 --> 01:11:39.260]   No, you're totally right, and let's be clear.
[01:11:39.260 --> 01:11:40.580]   We're not blaming the British people.
[01:11:40.580 --> 01:11:46.820]   It was the British empire model that the robber barons of Europe, the UK, and the US, books
[01:11:46.820 --> 01:11:48.020]   have been written on this.
[01:11:48.020 --> 01:11:51.300]   Winston Churchill basically advocated this, not in a bad way.
[01:11:51.300 --> 01:11:56.100]   He saw it as a good thing to merge with the US, but it's then been used by the leftists
[01:11:56.100 --> 01:12:03.940]   controlling that global imperial system to basically try to recolonize, reverse colonize
[01:12:03.940 --> 01:12:09.660]   the West with the third world, to have total hegemonic domination, and to betray the Renaissance,
[01:12:09.660 --> 01:12:15.140]   to betray the dream of Americana, and that's why globalism is poisonous and in so much
[01:12:15.140 --> 01:12:16.140]   trouble.
[01:12:16.140 --> 01:12:17.700]   It's historical fact.
[01:12:17.700 --> 01:12:24.260]   Any PhD-level, really thick, serious history book you read is just admitting the Atlantic
[01:12:24.260 --> 01:12:31.960]   system and the Anglophiles and how they popularized the first movies that we were all British.
[01:12:31.960 --> 01:12:36.680]   This is an admitted historical fact, but the general public doesn't understand it.
[01:12:36.680 --> 01:12:42.960]   Alex, here's another thing too, is one of the biggest CFR criminals that they ever had
[01:12:42.960 --> 01:12:45.080]   was Edward Mandelhouse.
[01:12:45.080 --> 01:12:46.080]   He was the one-
[01:12:46.080 --> 01:12:47.080]   Federal Reserve.
[01:12:47.080 --> 01:12:53.040]   ... who told Woodrow Wilson to get us into World War I, which was not really a world
[01:12:53.040 --> 01:12:54.040]   war.
[01:12:54.040 --> 01:13:00.400]   It was a European war, except for the incident at Gallipoli, but Edward Mandelhouse was one
[01:13:00.400 --> 01:13:05.240]   of the lowest of the globalist lowlifes, yet when you walk into the Federal Building in
[01:13:05.240 --> 01:13:12.240]   downtown Houston, the one at 515 Rusk Avenue, walk into the front entrance and then go to
[01:13:12.240 --> 01:13:18.880]   the right, and you'll see a big bronze plaque on the wall commemorating and celebrating
[01:13:18.880 --> 01:13:19.880]   Edward Mandelhouse.
[01:13:19.880 --> 01:13:23.660]   Sure, he was the brains behind Wilson, who later admitted that he'd been a traitor and
[01:13:23.660 --> 01:13:28.520]   set up to betray his country with the Federal Reserve, World War I, all of it, and of course
[01:13:28.520 --> 01:13:30.600]   there's House Park here in Austin.
[01:13:30.600 --> 01:13:34.440]   He was from Austin, so that's a good historical retrospective.
[01:13:34.440 --> 01:13:35.440]   Thank you so much.
[01:13:35.440 --> 01:13:38.880]   All right, I got to accelerate through calls now or I won't get to any of you, but at least
[01:13:38.880 --> 01:13:43.640]   I started trying to get to them earlier today when we come back from break.
[01:13:43.640 --> 01:13:52.360]   And I do have the proof here that the so-called Cook County prosecutor, Kim Fox, did not recuse
[01:13:52.360 --> 01:13:53.360]   herself.
[01:13:53.360 --> 01:13:54.360]   This is exclusive news.
[01:13:54.360 --> 01:14:00.480]   Remember, she said she recused herself but then killed the case, even though the grand
[01:14:00.480 --> 01:14:02.520]   jury had indicted Smollett.
[01:14:02.520 --> 01:14:05.360]   So this is another crime.
[01:14:05.360 --> 01:14:06.960]   This looks like running scared, folks.
[01:14:06.960 --> 01:14:11.400]   This is just, they've been ordered by Obama, "Do it, we'll protect you."
[01:14:11.400 --> 01:14:14.680]   This is going to have fireworks because I think they've miscalculated.
[01:14:14.680 --> 01:14:15.720]   Obama's not in power.
[01:14:15.720 --> 01:14:17.720]   Most of his deep state's been cut off.
[01:14:17.720 --> 01:14:19.560]   Hillary's deep state's been cut off.
[01:14:19.560 --> 01:14:22.880]   So yeah, those of us holding the line, it's rough to hold the line.
[01:14:22.880 --> 01:14:25.920]   You the listeners are holding the line, spread the word, supporting us.
[01:14:25.920 --> 01:14:29.680]   We're in this together, but it's rough for us to hold the line, but it's really rough
[01:14:29.680 --> 01:14:30.680]   for them.
[01:14:30.680 --> 01:14:31.680]   They're losing everything.
[01:14:31.680 --> 01:14:35.460]   We're going to go to break, come back with more of your calls.
[01:14:35.460 --> 01:14:41.280]   But please don't forget, we're running the biggest sale we've run since the Christmas
[01:14:41.280 --> 01:14:42.640]   sale.
[01:14:42.640 --> 01:14:45.160]   And I always say this is the biggest sale ever because we keep doing bigger and bigger
[01:14:45.160 --> 01:14:50.200]   sales because even though we make less money on each sale, when we really do mega sales,
[01:14:50.200 --> 01:14:55.000]   people buy more and it's been more successful to fund our operation, I want to expand.
[01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:56.960]   They've successfully held us back the last year.
[01:14:56.960 --> 01:14:59.480]   It's the first time in 20 something years we haven't expanded.
[01:14:59.480 --> 01:15:02.160]   I want to expand.
[01:15:02.160 --> 01:15:04.760]   Please financially support us and get great products you need.

[01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:55.000]   That's selling out.
[01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:58.000]   It's still massively discounted.
[01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:00.080]   Get the stinky dog away from me.
[01:16:00.080 --> 01:16:05.440]   Bad breath and bad gas PD stopped eating all his hair fell out, itching, licking, missing
[01:16:05.440 --> 01:16:11.640]   for at least $5,000 and that bill creams, antibiotics, sprays, no results.
[01:16:11.640 --> 01:16:16.720]   Everything we tried failed except the dynavite, d I N O V I T E.com.
[01:16:16.720 --> 01:16:19.120]   If you want the dog to be healthy, you got to feed it something healthy.
[01:16:19.120 --> 01:16:24.920]   The omega three fatty acids, flax seed, zinc, alfalfa, the digestive enzymes that are cooked
[01:16:24.920 --> 01:16:27.440]   out of regular dog food.
[01:16:27.440 --> 01:16:29.040]   Dynavite is nutrition.
[01:16:29.040 --> 01:16:30.840]   The shedding is stopped and the itching is stopped.
[01:16:30.840 --> 01:16:36.520]   Her coat is not soft, it's silky, it's healthy and shiny and glossy.
[01:16:36.520 --> 01:16:37.520]   She's got life.
[01:16:37.520 --> 01:16:40.360]   She's got energy, tons of energy, no more bad smell.
[01:16:40.360 --> 01:16:41.360]   Dynavite's the bomb.
[01:16:41.360 --> 01:16:44.880]   Dynavite is the best thing that's ever happened to my dogs.
[01:16:44.880 --> 01:16:46.880]   You know, besides me, of course.
[01:16:46.880 --> 01:16:47.880]   859-428-1000.
[01:16:47.880 --> 01:16:48.880]   859-428-1000.
[01:16:48.880 --> 01:16:49.880]   Dynavite for life.
[01:16:49.880 --> 01:16:50.880]   D I N O V I T E.com.
[01:16:50.880 --> 01:16:51.880]   Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[01:16:51.880 --> 01:16:52.880]   I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[01:16:52.880 --> 01:16:53.880]   I sued the IRS and won.
[01:16:53.880 --> 01:16:54.880]   I beat the IRS then and I've been beating them ever since.
[01:16:54.880 --> 01:16:55.880]   I wrote the book on tax debt settlement and I've helped thousands of people deal with
[01:16:55.880 --> 01:16:56.880]   tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[01:16:56.880 --> 01:16:57.880]   I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[01:16:57.880 --> 01:16:58.880]   I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[01:16:58.880 --> 01:16:59.880]   I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[01:16:59.880 --> 01:17:26.880]   I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[01:17:26.880 --> 01:17:30.680]   Most of you know that heart disease is the number one silent killer in the U.S.
[01:17:30.680 --> 01:17:35.560]   What if I told you for just $54.95 a month you could fight against heart disease naturally?
[01:17:35.560 --> 01:17:40.160]   At Heart and Body Extract, we've been helping thousands of people get back to a healthier
[01:17:40.160 --> 01:17:41.160]   heart.
[01:17:41.160 --> 01:17:42.160]   Don't just take my word for it.
[01:17:42.160 --> 01:17:45.360]   Check out all of the success stories at HBExtract.com.
[01:17:45.360 --> 01:17:49.440]   Or to order, call 866-295-5305.
[01:17:49.440 --> 01:17:52.440]   That's 866-295-5305.
[01:17:52.440 --> 01:17:54.280]   HBExtract.com.
[01:17:54.280 --> 01:17:56.080]   Don't risk it when you can take charge of it.
[01:17:56.080 --> 01:18:01.320]   There are thousands of ideologies out there.
[01:18:01.320 --> 01:18:03.480]   Hundreds of different political systems.
[01:18:03.480 --> 01:18:06.400]   And most of them are funded by the globalists.
[01:18:06.400 --> 01:18:08.920]   Info Wars is truly the tip of the spear of the zeitgeist.
[01:18:08.920 --> 01:18:12.600]   That's why the globalists are obsessed with it, trying to shut it down.
[01:18:12.600 --> 01:18:14.240]   I didn't invent all this.
[01:18:14.240 --> 01:18:19.000]   I went and researched the Renaissance, Americana, and what really works for humanity.
[01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:20.480]   And I'm simply trying to bring it back.
[01:18:20.480 --> 01:18:24.920]   And lo and behold, it's super popular like it's always been.
[01:18:24.920 --> 01:18:28.360]   That's why the globalists are trying to shut it down so desperately.
[01:18:28.360 --> 01:18:32.760]   Because we have the light in the dark of the night that sends chills up my spine.
[01:18:32.760 --> 01:18:37.280]   So whatever you do, continue to support yourself and Info Wars by buying the great products
[01:18:37.280 --> 01:18:41.720]   at InfoWarsStore.com, by spreading the articles, by spreading the videos, and by praying for
[01:18:41.720 --> 01:18:46.280]   this operation and for praying for this nation and the world for peace and discernment.
[01:18:46.280 --> 01:18:50.240]   For myself and the whole Info Wars family, I want to thank all of you for what you've
[01:18:50.240 --> 01:18:51.240]   done.
[01:18:51.240 --> 01:18:54.180]   Because without you, Info Wars is nothing.
[01:18:54.180 --> 01:18:56.880]   You are the Info War, and I salute you.
[01:18:56.880 --> 01:19:03.440]   I've been doing a lot of research into Google and YouTube censorship.
[01:19:03.440 --> 01:19:08.880]   And I've noticed that there's one type of video that is the most censored, the most
[01:19:08.880 --> 01:19:11.960]   buried, the most suppressed.
[01:19:11.960 --> 01:19:19.400]   And that's the videos where you saw in 2016 election night, all the arrogant leftist authoritarians
[01:19:19.400 --> 01:19:24.280]   like the Young Turks and others get so butt hurt when Trump won.
[01:19:24.280 --> 01:19:26.180]   They don't want us to have that victory.
[01:19:26.180 --> 01:19:29.440]   They don't want us to remember what political action did.
[01:19:29.440 --> 01:19:34.640]   And that's why the globalists, Hillary and others, are trying to shut Info Wars down.
[01:19:34.640 --> 01:19:39.720]   This is a fight about taking your speech away, not just my speech, about taking your very
[01:19:39.720 --> 01:19:41.140]   sovereignty away.
[01:19:41.140 --> 01:19:43.420]   This country is in a war.
[01:19:43.420 --> 01:19:47.240]   So again, I want to thank you for what you've done, but I want to remind you, if you don't
[01:19:47.240 --> 01:19:50.360]   spread the articles and videos, and if you don't financially get the great products we
[01:19:50.360 --> 01:19:53.920]   have and fund us, and the 360 win, we're dead in the water.
[01:19:53.920 --> 01:19:57.440]   I'm in your hands, you're in my hands, InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:19:57.440 --> 01:20:01.480]   Thank you.
[01:20:01.480 --> 01:20:04.120]   You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:04.120 --> 01:20:30.600]   >> Alex Jones here back live to watch the Democrats openly invoke racism.
[01:20:30.600 --> 01:20:35.200]   >> It's America's ethos and to say we're a bad country when we're one of the first nations
[01:20:35.200 --> 01:20:38.720]   to stand up for women's rights, minority rights, you name it.
[01:20:38.720 --> 01:20:43.320]   And to say, look, we have the Statue of Liberty, open yourself up to anybody who wants to come
[01:20:43.320 --> 01:20:44.320]   here.
[01:20:44.320 --> 01:20:48.760]   They would keep you on Ellis Island for six months to make sure you didn't have diseases.
[01:20:48.760 --> 01:20:52.920]   Now they just let people in, don't even cure them, and let them spread disease, it's so
[01:20:52.920 --> 01:20:53.920]   abusive.
[01:20:53.920 --> 01:20:57.440]   But it's all in our face.
[01:20:57.440 --> 01:21:03.200]   >> Let's go back to your phone calls right now.
[01:21:03.200 --> 01:21:05.320]   Let's talk to Alden in Arizona.
[01:21:05.320 --> 01:21:06.640]   Caller says he's a defense attorney.
[01:21:06.640 --> 01:21:09.120]   Let's talk about Jesse Smollett, go ahead.
[01:21:09.120 --> 01:21:10.920]   >> Hey, Alex.
[01:21:10.920 --> 01:21:14.200]   The state is always overzealous when it comes to prosecution.
[01:21:14.200 --> 01:21:18.360]   However, if Kim Fox handled all my cases, my clients would think I was the second coming
[01:21:18.360 --> 01:21:19.360]   of Christ.
[01:21:19.360 --> 01:21:25.280]   It is extremely rare, Alex, that prosecutors would drop a high profile 16 felony count
[01:21:25.280 --> 01:21:27.360]   case regardless of merit.
[01:21:27.360 --> 01:21:29.040]   It's almost impossible.
[01:21:29.040 --> 01:21:33.200]   We get DUI cases, misdemeanor cases where the prosecutor might drop one charge.
[01:21:33.200 --> 01:21:36.240]   16 counts dropped, it's extremely rare.
[01:21:36.240 --> 01:21:38.680]   I mean, there might be a better chance of hitting the lotto.
[01:21:38.680 --> 01:21:40.760]   That's how corrupt it is in Chicago.
[01:21:40.760 --> 01:21:43.960]   And you mentioned something, you were talking about, well, she didn't recuse herself, what's
[01:21:43.960 --> 01:21:44.960]   gonna happen to her?
[01:21:44.960 --> 01:21:48.800]   Well, the thing is, who controls the consequences?
[01:21:48.800 --> 01:21:49.800]   They go by the ABA standards.
[01:21:49.800 --> 01:21:50.800]   The ABA is left as it gets.
[01:21:50.800 --> 01:21:56.200]   So what are they gonna do, give her a suspension, license suspension or some sanctions?
[01:21:56.200 --> 01:21:58.760]   There's absolutely no recourse for her action.
[01:21:58.760 --> 01:22:01.040]   You could do your best and try, but what's gonna happen?
[01:22:01.040 --> 01:22:04.720]   Again, it all goes by who's doing the investigation, who's gonna punish her.
[01:22:04.720 --> 01:22:07.160]   The people who are gonna punish her are gonna let her off.
[01:22:07.160 --> 01:22:11.040]   So there really isn't that much you could do because it's like I said, they go by ABA
[01:22:11.040 --> 01:22:14.080]   standards, which is left as it gets.
[01:22:14.080 --> 01:22:16.680]   And all they could do is pass sanctions for her not recusing herself.
[01:22:16.680 --> 01:22:22.120]   So she's gonna get away scot-free just as small as it.
[01:22:22.120 --> 01:22:23.120]   >> That's a good point.
[01:22:23.120 --> 01:22:26.400]   And this broke on Infowars.com.
[01:22:26.400 --> 01:22:31.320]   The Chicago police strike back, release shield, Jesse Smollett case files.
[01:22:31.320 --> 01:22:32.840]   Jamie White writes about it.
[01:22:32.840 --> 01:22:38.200]   Local media obtained files through FOIA request after court sealed case from the public.
[01:22:38.200 --> 01:22:40.400]   So the police are fighting back.
[01:22:40.400 --> 01:22:42.880]   I mean, this makes justice a complete joke.
[01:22:42.880 --> 01:22:49.000]   When the police have the surveillance footage at both businesses and the magazine where
[01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:54.280]   they cut out the letters for the fake letter, and they have it all.
[01:22:54.280 --> 01:22:56.680]   I mean, it's so open and shut.
[01:22:56.680 --> 01:23:00.440]   How would the power structure think they could protect Smollett?
[01:23:00.440 --> 01:23:01.880]   They don't think they can protect him.
[01:23:01.880 --> 01:23:05.000]   They have to because it goes even higher.
[01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:07.720]   You say you're a defense attorney that deals with these cases.
[01:23:07.720 --> 01:23:09.400]   What do you think's really behind this?
[01:23:09.400 --> 01:23:11.240]   >> Well, here's the thing, Alex.
[01:23:11.240 --> 01:23:13.120]   You mentioned that you just said something.
[01:23:13.120 --> 01:23:16.800]   If the prosecution would have took the case to court, what would have happened?
[01:23:16.800 --> 01:23:19.200]   What would have happened is they would have won, and they know that.
[01:23:19.200 --> 01:23:21.560]   And if they would have won, Smollett would have been punished.
[01:23:21.560 --> 01:23:25.360]   But the only way to get this done quickly and get this out of it is make sure not to
[01:23:25.360 --> 01:23:26.360]   go to court.
[01:23:26.360 --> 01:23:27.560]   Now again, how'd this happen?
[01:23:27.560 --> 01:23:33.120]   You cannot have, go through 16 indictments through a grand jury, and then cases get dropped.
[01:23:33.120 --> 01:23:34.720]   That rarely ever happens.
[01:23:34.720 --> 01:23:38.040]   Look at examples like Michael Brown, other cases that went through the grand jury, and
[01:23:38.040 --> 01:23:40.080]   the cases, no charges were brought.
[01:23:40.080 --> 01:23:41.280]   It cannot happen.
[01:23:41.280 --> 01:23:45.800]   And the whole reason why it happened is because anytime cases get dropped, where a defense
[01:23:45.800 --> 01:23:50.800]   attorney could say, you know what, there's no way to do it, is from the higher ups.
[01:23:50.800 --> 01:23:52.800]   So again, who are the higher ups?
[01:23:52.800 --> 01:23:56.920]   Kim Fox, who controls the district court?
[01:23:56.920 --> 01:24:00.560]   Who controls- >> No, I agree, but don't they get in the
[01:24:00.560 --> 01:24:05.280]   court of public opinion, they're never going to get away with this.
[01:24:05.280 --> 01:24:09.120]   Thanks for the call, Alden, great points.
[01:24:09.120 --> 01:24:16.040]   It just shows how the left does whatever they want, whenever they want.
[01:24:16.040 --> 01:24:20.520]   It's that simple.
[01:24:20.520 --> 01:24:23.560]   Let's talk to Reagan in New York, who's a 14-year-old info warrior.
[01:24:23.560 --> 01:24:27.800]   He wants to talk about Jussie Smollett, then we'll go to Nathan.
[01:24:27.800 --> 01:24:30.040]   Go ahead, Reagan, thanks for calling.
[01:24:30.040 --> 01:24:32.720]   >> Hi, Alex, I'm a great fan of the show.
[01:24:32.720 --> 01:24:34.800]   I've watched you on my documentaries.
[01:24:34.800 --> 01:24:37.360]   I've listened to clips from the show.
[01:24:37.360 --> 01:24:38.360]   Sometimes I listen to the full show.
[01:24:38.360 --> 01:24:39.360]   >> Thank you.
[01:24:39.360 --> 01:24:40.360]   >> I love the show, it's fantastic.
[01:24:40.360 --> 01:24:43.600]   I got my hat on.
[01:24:43.600 --> 01:24:50.240]   I just want to say to the American people as a whole, how much of a defamation of the
[01:24:50.240 --> 01:24:57.880]   American justice system and Trump supporters, conservatives, right-wingers around the country
[01:24:57.880 --> 01:25:00.680]   that this Jussie Smollett thing is.
[01:25:00.680 --> 01:25:06.200]   >> Well, what are people your age saying about it?
[01:25:06.200 --> 01:25:10.960]   >> I haven't heard that much chatter about it, probably too controversial of a subject
[01:25:10.960 --> 01:25:11.960]   to talk about.
[01:25:11.960 --> 01:25:13.240]   But I'm a young Trump supporter.
[01:25:13.240 --> 01:25:18.720]   I've worn my MAGA hat around a few times, and sometimes I've been harassed about it
[01:25:18.720 --> 01:25:19.720]   and stuff.
[01:25:19.720 --> 01:25:25.680]   And what Jussie Smollett did was he increased the tension in this country, and that's a
[01:25:25.680 --> 01:25:27.800]   very evil thing to do, in my opinion.
[01:25:27.800 --> 01:25:31.840]   >> Well, that was his plan, and man, is he arrogant.
[01:25:31.840 --> 01:25:38.320]   What I can't believe is how he and his supporters and the people on the cast, a bunch of them,
[01:25:38.320 --> 01:25:41.360]   and the writers, I've covered it in the first hour.
[01:25:41.360 --> 01:25:47.140]   They taunted people and made fun of people and said, you made it up, he didn't do anything.
[01:25:47.140 --> 01:25:49.160]   They're now saying he still got attacked.
[01:25:49.160 --> 01:25:53.760]   So what they're saying is, well, he's a hero for staging this.
[01:25:53.760 --> 01:25:54.960]   He's gonna get away with it.
[01:25:54.960 --> 01:25:56.800]   That's really what they're saying.
[01:25:56.800 --> 01:26:03.760]   >> Yeah, and it's such a dangerous example for celebrities or just people in general,
[01:26:03.760 --> 01:26:08.480]   that if they align with the right party, they can get away with whatever they want, and
[01:26:08.480 --> 01:26:10.320]   they can wrong whoever they want.
[01:26:10.320 --> 01:26:13.280]   And it's a very dangerous message.
[01:26:13.280 --> 01:26:15.920]   >> You just said it a lot better than I could.
[01:26:15.920 --> 01:26:19.840]   It's a very dangerous message, and it says if you align with the right party, you are
[01:26:19.840 --> 01:26:21.480]   above the law.
[01:26:21.480 --> 01:26:27.040]   Which again, I've learned one thing about this universe.
[01:26:27.040 --> 01:26:28.640]   Leftist think one dimensionally.
[01:26:28.640 --> 01:26:32.560]   Yeah, you got the power in Chicago at one level, you got away with it.
[01:26:32.560 --> 01:26:37.680]   The mayor's smarter than that, the police, all of, you're not gonna get away with something
[01:26:37.680 --> 01:26:39.600]   this obvious.
[01:26:39.600 --> 01:26:44.320]   And it brings incredible attention to the city and to everybody else that's corrupt.
[01:26:44.320 --> 01:26:46.120]   So they're gonna burn Smollett.
[01:26:46.120 --> 01:26:48.560]   Let me predict right now.
[01:26:48.560 --> 01:26:51.760]   Smollett, and I don't want any harm against Smollett, but I'm telling you, he's gonna
[01:26:51.760 --> 01:26:56.680]   get charged by the feds, or he's gonna end up getting killed on the street.
[01:26:56.680 --> 01:27:02.760]   They're gonna get rid of him, because he's arrogant, he's cocky, he has no common sense,
[01:27:02.760 --> 01:27:04.840]   and he's a liability to everybody.
[01:27:04.840 --> 01:27:06.960]   Not just good people, bad people.
[01:27:06.960 --> 01:27:09.720]   Jussie Smollett is a idiot.
[01:27:09.720 --> 01:27:17.320]   And the prosecutor that tried to cover up for him, she's an even bigger moron, as if
[01:27:17.320 --> 01:27:23.920]   she thinks, I haven't even gotten to this yet, State Attorney Kim Fox, not recusing
[01:27:23.920 --> 01:27:28.880]   herself saying she did, that's a crime right there.
[01:27:28.880 --> 01:27:29.880]   It's fraud.
[01:27:29.880 --> 01:27:32.880]   I appreciate your call, God bless you, Reagan.
[01:27:32.880 --> 01:27:35.600]   Let's jam in one more before we go to break here.
[01:27:35.600 --> 01:27:37.600]   Let's go to Nathan in Alabama.
[01:27:37.600 --> 01:27:39.600]   Nathan, you're on the air, go ahead.
[01:27:39.600 --> 01:27:42.360]   >> Hey there, Mr. Jones, good afternoon, sir.
[01:27:42.360 --> 01:27:43.360]   >> Good to talk to you, sir.
[01:27:43.360 --> 01:27:46.240]   >> And yeah, absolutely, and it's great to be back with you.
[01:27:46.240 --> 01:27:49.360]   I've only spoken to you once before, but I was one of your info warriors who was actually
[01:27:49.360 --> 01:27:50.720]   banned from YouTube.
[01:27:50.720 --> 01:27:54.160]   It was actually you were talking about the content within the manifesto.
[01:27:54.160 --> 01:27:56.400]   And I haven't been able to get back on YouTube quite as yet.
[01:27:56.400 --> 01:27:59.240]   You told me to get a burner phone, I'm still gonna do that, Jones.
[01:27:59.240 --> 01:28:05.880]   But actually, for some context, look me up on Facebook, Nathan Waller, and it's on my
[01:28:05.880 --> 01:28:08.520]   new- >> Say that again, Nathan, Nathan what?
[01:28:08.520 --> 01:28:09.520]   >> Waller, W-A-L-L-E.
[01:28:09.520 --> 01:28:10.520]   >> Waller, got it.
[01:28:10.520 --> 01:28:14.280]   Well, I'm gonna hold you over, we got a guest coming up, and we'll get to all the calls.
[01:28:14.280 --> 01:28:18.360]   But yeah, we never said that Christchurch didn't happen.
[01:28:18.360 --> 01:28:21.760]   But the media can cover the manifesto, but we can't.
[01:28:21.760 --> 01:28:24.960]   And so yeah, anyone showing the manifesto gets banned.
[01:28:24.960 --> 01:28:27.160]   Well, since when are books banned?
[01:28:27.160 --> 01:28:28.920]   I mean, this is incredibly dangerous.
[01:28:28.920 --> 01:28:32.160]   And I had former Congressman, constitutional lawyer Bob Barr on your stage.
[01:28:32.160 --> 01:28:35.200]   He was saying, this is so un-American, it's so dangerous.
[01:28:35.200 --> 01:28:41.600]   But yeah, any video we show of the manifesto saying I'm a leftist, I hate Christians, they
[01:28:41.600 --> 01:28:46.080]   ban because they wanna blame conservatives, it's that simple.
[01:28:46.080 --> 01:28:48.520]   Is this America, are we still free or not?
[01:28:48.520 --> 01:28:53.480]   We'll come back to you, Nathan, Darren, Aaron, Jefferson, Johnny, Chris, Victor, Kellan,
[01:28:53.480 --> 01:28:56.280]   Lee, everybody stay with us.

[01:33:01.400 --> 01:33:10.400]   I've got a tiger by the tail that's playing the scene.
[01:33:10.400 --> 01:33:20.920]   I won't be much when you get through with me.
[01:33:20.920 --> 01:33:23.360]   He never gives up.
[01:33:23.360 --> 01:33:50.280]   He's Alex Jones, broadcasting from deep in the heart of Texas worldwide.
[01:33:50.280 --> 01:33:57.520]   We have reached a global crisis point where corporate media lied to us about babies being
[01:33:57.520 --> 01:34:02.560]   thrown into incubators to get us into the Iraq War in 1990 and the babies didn't get
[01:34:02.560 --> 01:34:03.560]   killed.
[01:34:03.560 --> 01:34:04.560]   There were no incubators.
[01:34:04.560 --> 01:34:05.560]   It was a lie.
[01:34:05.560 --> 01:34:12.560]   Then we got lied to about WMDs in 2003 and millions more died all over the world.
[01:34:12.560 --> 01:34:16.720]   And then we got lied to about so many other things down the line.
[01:34:16.720 --> 01:34:22.560]   But just recently, Jesse Smollett, the police have opened a shut case, all the video from
[01:34:22.560 --> 01:34:24.040]   every angle at the stores.
[01:34:24.040 --> 01:34:28.080]   They bought the ski mask, the bleach, the rope.
[01:34:28.080 --> 01:34:29.880]   They have the magazines.
[01:34:29.880 --> 01:34:34.440]   They clipped out the letters to send the racist note to him.
[01:34:34.440 --> 01:34:39.160]   You've got a whole bunch of the women that said that Kavanaugh raped him saying, oh,
[01:34:39.160 --> 01:34:40.840]   it didn't really happen.
[01:34:40.840 --> 01:34:46.080]   We just said that because he's a Republican.
[01:34:46.080 --> 01:34:52.000]   It's this decision by the left to lie about people and to just do it however you want,
[01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:53.000]   whenever you want.
[01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:57.800]   And then you've got them saying Trump would never win the election, all the fake polls
[01:34:57.800 --> 01:35:05.400]   and algorithms of 95 to 98% New York Times that Trump's going to lose.
[01:35:05.400 --> 01:35:08.880]   And then for two and a half years, we hear that any of us that voted for Trump, we were
[01:35:08.880 --> 01:35:11.120]   duped by the Russians or were Russian agents.
[01:35:11.120 --> 01:35:14.680]   Then we learned that's all fake.
[01:35:14.680 --> 01:35:17.200]   And so we've reached this point like with the Covington kids.
[01:35:17.200 --> 01:35:20.520]   It's a few months ago, seems like 100 years ago now.
[01:35:20.520 --> 01:35:22.640]   They're waiting for their bus.
[01:35:22.640 --> 01:35:28.480]   There's black Israelite group that's basically like black Nazis screaming at the Native American
[01:35:28.480 --> 01:35:30.580]   that he's subhuman, the whites are subhuman.
[01:35:30.580 --> 01:35:33.520]   They're going to harvest their organs that you're devils.
[01:35:33.520 --> 01:35:36.720]   The kids move away to try to get on the bus.
[01:35:36.720 --> 01:35:37.720]   They come over.
[01:35:37.720 --> 01:35:39.320]   The Native American comes over.
[01:35:39.320 --> 01:35:42.400]   He's a Democratic operative, beats a drum, gets in their face.
[01:35:42.400 --> 01:35:45.560]   They say he's assaulted and attacked by him.
[01:35:45.560 --> 01:35:46.560]   Turns out it's all a fraud.
[01:35:46.560 --> 01:35:53.440]   And the entire corporate media went with it, saying that he was a devil.
[01:35:53.440 --> 01:35:58.320]   Saying that that young man that just stood there nicely, while the person beat a drum
[01:35:58.320 --> 01:36:01.880]   in his face and people, if you listen to the audio said, F you white person, you're going
[01:36:01.880 --> 01:36:02.880]   to die.
[01:36:02.880 --> 01:36:04.680]   We'll get your organs, F you white.
[01:36:04.680 --> 01:36:08.720]   He just sits there stoically, and he's bad for existing.
[01:36:08.720 --> 01:36:13.360]   And the whole fraud got pushed by the media from NPR to CNN.
[01:36:13.360 --> 01:36:15.600]   Hell, they still push it.
[01:36:15.600 --> 01:36:17.480]   And they edit videos of me all the time.
[01:36:17.480 --> 01:36:19.360]   I'll go into a restaurant.
[01:36:19.360 --> 01:36:20.680]   People come over and say, F you and your family.
[01:36:20.680 --> 01:36:21.680]   I'm trying to leave.
[01:36:21.680 --> 01:36:22.720]   They're waiting at the door.
[01:36:22.720 --> 01:36:23.840]   They shoot video.
[01:36:23.840 --> 01:36:28.600]   They edit me saying, F you back, go, Joe's just attacked us on our table.
[01:36:28.600 --> 01:36:33.560]   I walk over to a table and go, F you, screw you, you want some?
[01:36:33.560 --> 01:36:35.560]   They're like, we're going to kill you.
[01:36:35.560 --> 01:36:36.640]   We eat crap.
[01:36:36.640 --> 01:36:38.360]   We're going to get you, buddy.
[01:36:38.360 --> 01:36:41.040]   And I'm finally like, you know, it's the fourth time you did it tonight.
[01:36:41.040 --> 01:36:42.040]   Okay, let's go.
[01:36:42.040 --> 01:36:43.040]   We're just at our table.
[01:36:43.040 --> 01:36:49.040]   Imagine, let me just randomly walk over to that table.
[01:36:49.040 --> 01:36:51.880]   Screw you, F you.
[01:36:51.880 --> 01:36:55.760]   It's all over the top of Reddit, all over leftist media saying I just attacked some
[01:36:55.760 --> 01:36:57.400]   table.
[01:36:57.400 --> 01:37:02.000]   But it doesn't matter because the truth's coming out and people know it's okay to ask
[01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:04.360]   questions and that's all we're doing.
[01:37:04.360 --> 01:37:05.880]   Doesn't mean we're always right.
[01:37:05.880 --> 01:37:11.200]   But so much stuff gets staged like the Air Force Academy and the N-word and the Jewish
[01:37:11.200 --> 01:37:15.000]   centers getting tombstones tumped over and Trump says it's probably staged.
[01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:16.600]   Turned out it was.
[01:37:16.600 --> 01:37:19.640]   You got to look at motive here and you got to ask questions.
[01:37:19.640 --> 01:37:23.400]   And you got to understand when you go out to a public event, conservatives don't attack
[01:37:23.400 --> 01:37:26.320]   liberals.
[01:37:26.320 --> 01:37:28.880]   The leftists attack conservatives.
[01:37:28.880 --> 01:37:34.080]   And that's what we're facing is a bunch of bullying scum staging events.
[01:37:34.080 --> 01:37:36.040]   And they can't believe you won't believe them anymore.
[01:37:36.040 --> 01:37:37.800]   So they just stage bigger events.
[01:37:37.800 --> 01:37:39.900]   But it isn't working.
[01:37:39.900 --> 01:37:40.900]   So what are they going to do next?
[01:37:40.900 --> 01:37:44.080]   That's really the big question.
[01:37:44.080 --> 01:37:49.960]   Now shifting gears, very intelligent, very lovely lady, Faith Goldie.
[01:37:49.960 --> 01:37:52.600]   And I have the article right over here.
[01:37:52.600 --> 01:37:54.560]   We'll put it up on screen.
[01:37:54.560 --> 01:38:02.480]   Watch Faith Goldie violently attack for holding anti-racism sign at anti-racist protests.
[01:38:02.480 --> 01:38:05.240]   BigLeaguePolitics.com.
[01:38:05.240 --> 01:38:08.960]   And so she was going to win the mayoral race.
[01:38:08.960 --> 01:38:11.040]   She was in the top three out of 35 candidates.
[01:38:11.040 --> 01:38:14.480]   They just banned her from the race basically.
[01:38:14.480 --> 01:38:18.920]   But she continues to fight on Faith Goldie, FaithGoldie.com, Twitter, Faith Goldie.
[01:38:18.920 --> 01:38:20.280]   Faith, thank you for joining us.
[01:38:20.280 --> 01:38:22.720]   We're going to roll this footage in a moment.
[01:38:22.720 --> 01:38:24.640]   But I'm glad that they didn't beat you up too bad.
[01:38:24.640 --> 01:38:26.440]   But we're going to play this shocking footage.
[01:38:26.440 --> 01:38:29.680]   My Lord, this is getting crazy.
[01:38:29.680 --> 01:38:30.680]   Absolutely.
[01:38:30.680 --> 01:38:32.600]   Thank you, Alex, thanks so much for having me on.
[01:38:32.600 --> 01:38:38.200]   Yeah, basically the purpose of our video was to attend a left wing rally that claimed to
[01:38:38.200 --> 01:38:44.160]   be united against racism in the wake of the terror attack in New Zealand against innocent
[01:38:44.160 --> 01:38:45.400]   faithful.
[01:38:45.400 --> 01:38:48.960]   And so we thought we'd go out there and say, well, you're against racism, so are we.
[01:38:48.960 --> 01:38:52.400]   And we want to just make sure because a lot of the noise after the New Zealand terror
[01:38:52.400 --> 01:38:59.440]   attack seemed to put Trump and basically every other normal white guy into this giant group
[01:38:59.440 --> 01:39:02.520]   of Nazis, neo-Nazis and white supremacists.
[01:39:02.520 --> 01:39:06.920]   And we wanted to stand there in solidarity with people, but also say that we acknowledge
[01:39:06.920 --> 01:39:11.280]   that not all white men, not all white men want to shoot up mosques.
[01:39:11.280 --> 01:39:14.800]   Not all white men are neo-Nazis and white supremacists.
[01:39:14.800 --> 01:39:20.560]   And that it's okay to be white, that people should never feel that in order to love themselves,
[01:39:20.560 --> 01:39:22.460]   they have to resort to violence.
[01:39:22.460 --> 01:39:27.480]   We want to create basically the same thing the left has been telling us for years, Alex,
[01:39:27.480 --> 01:39:33.800]   a safe space for us to identify as we wish, to love ourselves as God created us.
[01:39:33.800 --> 01:39:38.600]   And what happened within about 30 seconds of flashing our innocuous, not hateful signs.
[01:39:38.600 --> 01:39:42.920]   In fact, when you think about it, after a Muslim terrorist attack, an Islamist terror
[01:39:42.920 --> 01:39:46.160]   attack, we see the hashtag not all Muslims all the time.
[01:39:46.160 --> 01:39:50.680]   So all we did was basically give them a taste of their own medicine within 30 seconds.
[01:39:50.680 --> 01:39:55.220]   Myself, my cameraman and some of the guys that I was traveling with, one of which had
[01:39:55.220 --> 01:39:58.760]   a MAGA hat on, were completely rushed.
[01:39:58.760 --> 01:40:03.360]   We had these weird antifa freaks, guys who work, you can see some of the footage right
[01:40:03.360 --> 01:40:08.320]   there, higher up, that is a union representative who was coming after my friend in the MAGA
[01:40:08.320 --> 01:40:09.320]   hat.
[01:40:09.320 --> 01:40:10.320]   Okay.
[01:40:10.320 --> 01:40:13.160]   So this is how high the far left have now climbed.
[01:40:13.160 --> 01:40:15.000]   And he knows that the camera is rolling on him.
[01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:19.520]   They're trying to shut us down, but he keeps on swinging punches, swinging punches.
[01:40:19.520 --> 01:40:24.640]   And eventually you'll see the cops kind of get involved, but my buddy gets arrested too.
[01:40:24.640 --> 01:40:29.440]   My buddy out of the people who were arrested was the only one who was actually dragged.
[01:40:29.440 --> 01:40:33.440]   And I don't want to make this comparison, but I couldn't help but feel Christ's present.
[01:40:33.440 --> 01:40:38.800]   He was, he was dragged like Christ before the screaming, chattering classes over there
[01:40:38.800 --> 01:40:39.800]   saying, yes, victory.
[01:40:39.800 --> 01:40:44.680]   But for me, it wasn't a victory for them, but a victory for us to show that it took,
[01:40:44.680 --> 01:40:49.520]   frankly, a big old brass pair for this guy to get up there and do what he felt was right
[01:40:49.520 --> 01:40:54.620]   at that time, which was to wear his MAGA hat and hold up a sign as a young white man that
[01:40:54.620 --> 01:40:57.760]   not all white men, he is a good man.
[01:40:57.760 --> 01:41:01.560]   He's not physically attacked anywhere.
[01:41:01.560 --> 01:41:03.880]   You go near and left us wearing a hat.
[01:41:03.880 --> 01:41:07.600]   These people are dangerous authoritarians and we've got to do it.
[01:41:07.600 --> 01:41:08.920]   In fact, I'm going to do it soon.
[01:41:08.920 --> 01:41:13.140]   I'm not a daredevil, but I intend to go to left the cities and wear the hat and then
[01:41:13.140 --> 01:41:15.200]   do it because it's got to be done.
[01:41:15.200 --> 01:41:18.040]   You know, I just had this thing last weekend where I'm sitting in my wife.
[01:41:18.040 --> 01:41:20.120]   We went to dinner with Joe Rogan, not name dropping.
[01:41:20.120 --> 01:41:21.800]   We went, we had great steak.
[01:41:21.800 --> 01:41:23.480]   She didn't like her lobster tacos.
[01:41:23.480 --> 01:41:25.720]   She goes, I want, I want some oysters.
[01:41:25.720 --> 01:41:28.440]   So we pull in to Lucy's fried chicken and get some oysters.
[01:41:28.440 --> 01:41:29.440]   We go there all the time.
[01:41:29.440 --> 01:41:30.440]   Shouldn't say that.
[01:41:30.440 --> 01:41:32.100]   They'll be there waiting for us.
[01:41:32.100 --> 01:41:34.360]   But these leftists come in and said they're going to attack us.
[01:41:34.360 --> 01:41:35.840]   They're going to get us.
[01:41:35.840 --> 01:41:36.840]   And we go outside.
[01:41:36.840 --> 01:41:39.600]   They're waiting for us at the door screaming, we're going to kill you.
[01:41:39.600 --> 01:41:41.720]   Basically, the video is raw.
[01:41:41.720 --> 01:41:42.720]   They edit it.
[01:41:42.720 --> 01:41:45.480]   The media puts out that I attack them.
[01:41:45.480 --> 01:41:47.000]   I mean, it's just unbelievable.
[01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:51.680]   Alex, when I first saw that clip of you at the restaurant, I literally showed my husband.
[01:41:51.680 --> 01:41:54.480]   I said, see, babe, this is why I don't go out downtown.
[01:41:54.480 --> 01:41:57.920]   The last time I went out for a drink downtown was a couple of weeks ago.
[01:41:57.920 --> 01:42:02.160]   And a stout, darker man ran up to me and told me that I was an Islamophobe.
[01:42:02.160 --> 01:42:07.840]   And the only reason why I was upset was because our meaning, I guess, I don't know, Canadian
[01:42:07.840 --> 01:42:13.840]   wombs were barren and that we, meaning him, his people, whatever, we're going to quote
[01:42:13.840 --> 01:42:15.400]   repopulate our country.
[01:42:15.400 --> 01:42:18.900]   And I'm thinking, I just want to have a glass of wine in peace.
[01:42:18.900 --> 01:42:20.200]   But this is the thing with the left.
[01:42:20.200 --> 01:42:22.120]   They do not give us a safe space.
[01:42:22.120 --> 01:42:25.080]   They have colonized our spaces, whether it be in our private life.
[01:42:25.080 --> 01:42:27.880]   Oh, one of the top moms came out and said, we're weak.
[01:42:27.880 --> 01:42:30.960]   He's going to they're going to take us over just this week.
[01:42:30.960 --> 01:42:31.960]   Yep.
[01:42:31.960 --> 01:42:33.840]   And this is people got to wake up.
[01:42:33.840 --> 01:42:34.840]   It's out there.
[01:42:34.840 --> 01:42:35.840]   Put yourself out there.
[01:42:35.840 --> 01:42:36.840]   And Alex, I can't wait to see you do some MAGA.
[01:42:36.840 --> 01:42:37.840]   I'm going to do it.
[01:42:37.840 --> 01:42:41.840]   I mean, I have these guys like, I'm going to kill you.
[01:42:41.840 --> 01:42:43.160]   So I go, OK, let's go.
[01:42:43.160 --> 01:42:44.840]   And he goes, I'm a victim.
[01:42:44.840 --> 01:42:45.840]   Security helped me.
[01:42:45.840 --> 01:42:47.640]   It's like, do this isn't simulation.
[01:42:47.640 --> 01:42:49.480]   You just said you're going to get me eat.
[01:42:49.480 --> 01:42:50.480]   You know what?
[01:42:50.480 --> 01:42:51.480]   Let's go.
[01:42:51.480 --> 01:42:52.480]   And I'm like, let's go.
[01:42:52.480 --> 01:42:57.640]   And it's like it's all simulation for them.
[01:42:57.640 --> 01:43:02.520]   There are thousands of ideologies out there, hundreds of different political systems, and
[01:43:02.520 --> 01:43:05.400]   most of them are funded by the globalist.
[01:43:05.400 --> 01:43:08.000]   Info Wars is truly the tip of the spear of the zeitgeist.
[01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:11.640]   That's what a globalist are obsessed with it, trying to shut it down.
[01:43:11.640 --> 01:43:13.240]   I didn't invent all this.
[01:43:13.240 --> 01:43:18.040]   I went and researched the Renaissance, Americana, and what really works for humanity.
[01:43:18.040 --> 01:43:19.520]   And I'm simply trying to bring it back.
[01:43:19.520 --> 01:43:23.920]   And lo and behold, it's super popular like it's always been.
[01:43:23.920 --> 01:43:27.920]   That's why the globalists are trying to shut it down so desperately, because we have the
[01:43:27.920 --> 01:43:30.120]   light in the dark of the night.
[01:43:30.120 --> 01:43:31.800]   That sends chills up my spine.
