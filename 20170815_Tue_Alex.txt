[00:00.000 --> 00:28.120]  Welcome to the Alex Jones show we are live on this Tuesday August 15th in the fight for
[00:28.120 --> 00:33.240]  the republic the fight for the future of America Alex Jones is working from the road today
[00:33.240 --> 00:38.360]  Owen Schroyer here hosting we are joined by Alex Jones now to kick off the show Alex
[00:38.360 --> 00:44.320]  it's wild times we're living in right now brother it certainly is we remember back
[00:44.320 --> 00:48.360]  during the campaign we have the WikiLeaks but we knew this before we got the WikiLeaks
[00:48.360 --> 00:52.760]  they were sending mainly minorities and women trying to get them to start fights at Trump
[00:52.760 --> 00:57.760]  rallies and in areas like Chicago ordering the police to stand down wanting to get a
[00:57.760 --> 01:03.760]  riot and then saying cancel Trump rallies he isn't as a presidential candidate even allowed
[01:03.760 --> 01:11.360]  to have rallies he's causing the hate he's causing the violence then a man who was in
[01:11.360 --> 01:16.680]  Occupy Wall Street worked with the Democratic Party then was in Black Lives Matter you
[01:16.680 --> 01:24.680]  cannot make this up worked for the Barack Obama campaign he now leads the so-called unify
[01:24.680 --> 01:30.480]  the alt-right so Hillary creates the term alt-right they put that out they tell us that's what
[01:30.480 --> 01:36.880]  you are she's God she tells you what you are she is Lord she is Madam President then they
[01:36.880 --> 01:43.520]  connect the white supremacists and the Nazis into the term alt-right then they foment events
[01:43.520 --> 01:48.440]  like this have the police stand down which is confirmed then there is some violence there
[01:48.440 --> 01:55.400]  is a sad death and boom then they projected on to President Trump they projected on to
[01:55.400 --> 02:01.480]  the American people just like when there's a shooting every gun owner is guilty except
[02:01.480 --> 02:06.680]  authoritarian states that have guns it's fine for them to have guns but every private citizen
[02:06.680 --> 02:12.320]  that owns a gun is guilty now I said this a few days ago I said Trump came out said both
[02:12.320 --> 02:16.920]  sides are being bad this is stupid we should love each other we should come together that
[02:16.920 --> 02:20.520]  way you're not just sitting there bashing white people or black people or anybody else
[02:20.520 --> 02:25.360]  you're pointing out that this is wrong there's racist on both sides black lives matter and
[02:25.360 --> 02:29.400]  these groups are absolutely racist you know they push this whole anti-white agenda to
[02:29.400 --> 02:36.880]  get whites into their own racial agenda that is the program operation that they're launching
[02:36.880 --> 02:42.600]  he said the right thing clearly at you know Bannon and his own advice but Trump's smart
[02:42.600 --> 02:45.920]  as well you know it was him earlier this year said all these attacks on Jewish centers
[02:45.920 --> 02:49.560]  these hundreds and hundreds of bomb threats may have been coming from the other side the
[02:49.560 --> 02:56.160]  left to blame Trump and it turned out indeed they caught the ringleader who was a Jewish
[02:56.160 --> 03:01.480]  journalist obviously coordinating others but they shut it down very very quickly former
[03:01.480 --> 03:07.280]  journalist arrested charged with threats against Jewish facilities so now today I'm going to
[03:07.280 --> 03:13.960]  go over some documented examples after the break of famous Nazis that were Jewish there's
[03:13.960 --> 03:18.280]  been best-selling books written on this they go oh you're being anti-Semitic no I'm not
[03:18.280 --> 03:23.480]  George Soros helping round up tens of thousands of Jews and killing them I'm I'm not George
[03:23.480 --> 03:28.520]  Soros trying to overthrow Israel but see this is how they this is how they overturn reality
[03:28.520 --> 03:33.720]  on the left is saying Trump's anti-Semitic he's a great friend of Israel and married
[03:33.720 --> 03:38.680]  into Orthodox Jews and their lovely family you know same thing here it doesn't matter
[03:38.680 --> 03:43.400]  if they caught Jewish groups and other leftist groups and liberal groups and Hispanic groups
[03:43.400 --> 03:48.360]  and everything else going and highly Hitler at Trump events to say that his people were
[03:48.360 --> 03:53.440]  doing it it doesn't matter if attacks on Jewish centers and attacks on Jewish cemeteries people
[03:53.440 --> 03:59.760]  got caught again this is a fight against the people like George Soros Nazi collaborators
[03:59.760 --> 04:07.480]  that literally feed on Jews and fund anti-Semitism like the group Soros funded in Ukraine total
[04:07.480 --> 04:12.360]  Nazis to overthrow that government so we're gonna put videos together in the next few
[04:12.360 --> 04:17.720]  days to professional videos with all the news articles all the clips all the proof all the
[04:17.720 --> 04:23.000]  facts just to show it because I did that on purpose I've been doing it for months trying
[04:23.000 --> 04:28.000]  to bait the media into coming out and lying and attacking me you know saying oh Jones
[04:28.000 --> 04:33.200]  you know you know claims that some Jews are posing as Nazis I've been waiting for them
[04:33.200 --> 04:39.400]  to do this because I'm gonna expose Soros and I'm gonna wait into this and show again
[04:39.400 --> 04:43.800]  what this monster has done but again I'm the bad guy because I'm not against Israel like
[04:43.800 --> 04:49.080]  Soros and I didn't help kill Jews so so I'm the bad person if you kill Jews in mass if
[04:49.080 --> 04:53.040]  you want to overthrow Israel if you want to overthrow Trump if you want to overthrow America
[04:53.040 --> 04:57.280]  and you're funding racist groups then you're wonderful give your George not those Soros
[04:57.280 --> 05:04.160]  we're winning why is the fungus why is the mold why is the yeast taking over what is

[06:14.440 --> 06:19.960]  much better nutrition than we do today and our ancient ancestors sought out the bones
[06:19.960 --> 06:25.200]  of the animals that they were hunting killing and then processing and so I set out to develop

[08:29.360 --> 08:35.240]  from the globalist social engineers that use class warfare that use economic warfare that
[08:35.240 --> 08:41.040]  also use biological warfare through the gmo through the vaccines of the geoengineering
[08:41.040 --> 08:46.840]  to control populations but we know they try to say everybody that supported trump was
[08:46.840 --> 08:52.440]  a racist and they sent rioters in mainly minorities and women to the trump events it's in the
[08:52.440 --> 08:58.520]  wiki leaks to attack people to try to get fights going to get trumps rallies canceled
[08:58.520 --> 09:06.360]  and the media said cancel your rallies that's why it wasn't hard for me on saturday as the
[09:06.360 --> 09:11.960]  rallying by moron groups on both sides was going on in charlesville virginia but i said
[09:11.960 --> 09:18.040]  you watch the talking point will be time to ban these rallies and what's cnn and msnbc
[09:18.040 --> 09:25.360]  and the washington post and google and facebook and twitter are doing is ganging up on mainline
[09:25.360 --> 09:32.400]  trump supporting groups uh billy weavers flyover america that is simply hey if you have a small
[09:32.400 --> 09:37.240]  business or you know you live in one of these small towns or in flyover areas we want to
[09:37.240 --> 09:42.000]  interview you that's why it's like folks that own restaurants and gas stations and we're
[09:42.000 --> 09:48.920]  interviewing black folks white folks everybody just totally wholesome good program uh with
[09:48.920 --> 09:54.920]  milley uh i mean we're talking g rated folks unless antifa shows up screaming and yelling
[09:54.920 --> 10:00.680]  and cussing and throwing poo poo water balloons at people and cbs put out a piece saying here's
[10:00.680 --> 10:07.080]  the all right white supremacist meaning look look she has blonde she has blonde hair this
[10:07.080 --> 10:13.560]  is their hateful stereotypical anti-white garbage that's pushed by msm to make whites think
[10:13.560 --> 10:19.920]  they're being racially attacked and to create that racial uh dichotomy so after her saturday
[10:19.920 --> 10:24.120]  her and gabin getting pepper sprayed witnessing all of this and now witnessing the cbs news
[10:24.120 --> 10:28.080]  piece that will play a short clip of coming up at the bottom of the hour we'll look at
[10:28.080 --> 10:32.440]  all that i'm on the road working on a big investigation and i'll be live here the next
[10:32.440 --> 10:38.480]  few days with you but in studio we've got owens shroyer we've got uh coming into mara and
[10:38.480 --> 10:44.680]  through friday we've got roger stone to be co-hosting in studio uh we told you first
[10:44.680 --> 10:48.720]  that you know trump didn't know that our pio was facing six months in prison for doing
[10:48.720 --> 10:53.480]  his job and forcing uh you know the border law uh arresting people with felonies and
[10:53.480 --> 10:59.480]  the people that have committed dwi as you name it uh but now uh trump did learn about
[10:59.480 --> 11:05.560]  that a few weeks ago i'll just leave it at that uh and he is looking at a part of our
[11:05.560 --> 11:10.120]  pio so we're gonna of course he popped in for like five ten minutes later uh to break
[11:10.120 --> 11:15.480]  that down and and there could be a pardon by the end of the week uh also bannon could
[11:15.480 --> 11:19.960]  be out by the end of the week uh that move is real uh so there's a lot of things we're
[11:19.960 --> 11:27.320]  gonna be covering uh on that front as well they put the lie out uh to the president and
[11:27.320 --> 11:33.160]  others that it's bannon leaking and coordinating the so-called independent uh media that they
[11:33.160 --> 11:37.880]  call alt right i know we do our research we see what's happening we know what's going
[11:37.880 --> 11:43.800]  on i have never talked to bannon about policy about news stories about ideas i've had a
[11:43.800 --> 11:48.680]  cell phone number for a long time from back like two and a half years ago when folks at
[11:48.680 --> 11:53.800]  right bar were saying i should get him on and then i would call and we play phone tag and
[11:53.800 --> 11:58.760]  ever get him on and then once he was the advisor of the president chief advisor i'd send him
[11:58.760 --> 12:03.000]  a few text messages saying hey please come on he'd say brother not doing interviews you know
[12:03.000 --> 12:07.320]  just trying to save the republic you know you know appreciate your work have a good one i'd
[12:07.320 --> 12:11.400]  ask him to come on again he'd say you know just too focused in here i'm not a public
[12:11.400 --> 12:15.800]  guy i don't do any interviews i don't talk any press that's my rule i talk to no one except
[12:15.800 --> 12:21.400]  the president boom that's what he does he sits there and he strategizes in a war room with a
[12:21.400 --> 12:27.160]  bunch of whiteboards with their goals with their plans like cutting taxes like killing tpp
[12:27.160 --> 12:33.480]  by killing the the carbon taxes like uh you know defending the second amendment uh deporting people
[12:33.480 --> 12:39.560]  that have felonies uh to get in the va to fix its problems and to privatize it to give people
[12:39.560 --> 12:44.360]  an option i mean they've delivered on like half of what they said they do in seven months and
[12:44.360 --> 12:48.760]  that's why the globalists are panicking getting a good supreme court justice in getting the stock
[12:48.760 --> 12:54.120]  market up getting over a thousand companies to come into the u.s trump is taking the political power
[12:54.120 --> 13:00.200]  away from the the elites that are gatekeepers and make people go through you know the elites to
[13:00.200 --> 13:04.040]  basically have jobs or have a future and he's transferring it back to the people and back to
[13:04.040 --> 13:11.240]  the states he is devolving power and anybody that wants to be weak-minded and mind all this
[13:11.240 --> 13:15.960]  race garbage they deserve what they get because you know trump came out and said this is terrible
[13:15.960 --> 13:19.880]  what happened they said oh that's not enough even though he said i had to cry all racism
[13:19.880 --> 13:25.640]  on both sides then he comes out specifically and goes after these other groups and they say that's
[13:25.640 --> 13:31.640]  not enough on msnbc the videos are on info wars dot com the steve watch an article and the news wars
[13:31.640 --> 13:40.600]  dot com our news site one with prison planet dot com and they say uh heal what he is a nazi he is a
[13:40.600 --> 13:47.240]  nazi and meanwhile the mother and the brother of the young lady that died sadly they've come out and
[13:47.240 --> 13:52.840]  said they appreciate trump comforting them and his kind words so they don't want to be used by the
[13:52.840 --> 13:57.960]  media the way of a bloody shirt you notice whenever somebody gets run over by radical jahads when that
[13:57.960 --> 14:03.080]  is a real organized group doing it they never say it's a muslima did it or the leftist goes and shoots
[14:03.080 --> 14:07.240]  some you know councilman in his yard last week to death because he's a republican they never
[14:07.240 --> 14:11.480]  personalize it or they never say it's left-wing terrorism when a congressman and others get shot
[14:11.480 --> 14:20.200]  in dc and the left celebrates it says hashtag hunt republicans they want a civil war because they
[14:20.200 --> 14:25.000]  believe that they can then confuse the public to fight with each other and that'll keep the elite
[14:25.000 --> 14:31.160]  empowered during that crisis just like a prison riot the warden uses that to keep control if he
[14:31.160 --> 14:35.400]  starts getting people unifying the blacks the whites the Hispanics and others in the prison
[14:35.400 --> 14:39.960]  against bad policies or against corruption or against slave labor you know things that have
[14:39.960 --> 14:45.080]  happened historically in the past that are put in fictional accounts like shawshank redemption
[14:45.080 --> 14:50.280]  they'll use racial issues to control people uh once folks start getting a little bit too
[14:50.280 --> 14:57.320]  too awake or too uppity so all that's going on but some people are getting psyched out by this
[14:58.040 --> 15:03.800]  some people are getting psyched out saying oh my gosh you know uh folks are canceling their
[15:03.800 --> 15:08.760]  events because they think that they're going to have anti-focum attack them if they have these
[15:08.760 --> 15:14.840]  events well if you start doing that they've already won and i'm not blaming people that have
[15:14.840 --> 15:19.640]  canceled some of their events uh just because they want to have security or want to be able to
[15:19.640 --> 15:24.360]  not let the globalist piggyback on what they're doing but the answer is to say we're having a
[15:24.360 --> 15:31.400]  peaceful event that's inclusive like we're going to march against google's censorship of people
[15:31.400 --> 15:39.240]  across the board peacefully or we're gonna march for tax cuts or we're gonna march uh for uh you
[15:39.240 --> 15:45.240]  know the repeal of obama care we're gonna march for better va care for our veterans or we're gonna
[15:45.240 --> 15:54.120]  march for labeling of gmo or we're going to march for all of these same you know school choice issues
[15:54.680 --> 16:01.080]  this is what unifies us around policy and around real ideas and i fully understand why millie
[16:02.360 --> 16:07.880]  canceled some of her meetups because all they're doing is you know on on flyover america on our
[16:07.880 --> 16:13.400]  little facebook page is driving around to see the forgotten americans of every race color and creed
[16:13.400 --> 16:19.400]  that hollywood on the west coast and the east coast disdainfully call flyover country and bitter
[16:19.400 --> 16:24.600]  clingers and it's bringing people together and so if the media focuses on look at millie weaver
[16:24.600 --> 16:29.000]  you know she's this alt right person and she's this evil person and she's having these meetups
[16:29.000 --> 16:36.840]  they are trying to sick bully terrorist anti-fascum to come attack it though so the media can churn up
[16:36.840 --> 16:42.360]  more violence in america blame on everybody and try to restrict free speech so i understand on a small
[16:42.360 --> 16:47.400]  budget and our little reporters out there that we need to cancel those for now to you know reassess
[16:47.400 --> 16:52.200]  what we're going to do and then maybe have bigger events where we can have more security control
[16:52.200 --> 16:57.080]  the situation and use it as a place where the police won't stand down in a jurisdiction we
[16:57.080 --> 17:01.320]  know isn't controlled by globalists to then illustrate what's really happening but i'm not
[17:01.320 --> 17:06.520]  talking about her other people are even saying i'm not going to support trump anymore because i
[17:06.520 --> 17:09.960]  don't want people to call me a racist well if you do that it's never going to end they're going to
[17:09.960 --> 17:13.720]  say you don't like obama carry your racist you don't want to turn your guns in your racist
[17:13.720 --> 17:19.480]  you don't want open borders your racist this is the new religion of bullying and control
[17:19.480 --> 17:26.280]  that these bullies consciously know that they're carrying out but the answer is we're now on the

[17:53.640 --> 17:58.200]  or racists and we got a good case we're suing you even though it'd be a long drawn out deal we have
[17:58.200 --> 18:03.480]  to set the precedent that you can't do it you can't have a nice young lady in our camera guy
[18:03.480 --> 18:08.440]  going around to meet flyover america and talking about american values and bringing us together
[18:08.440 --> 18:15.800]  red white and blue that so sickens the social engineer race pimps the scum of cnn the scum of
[18:15.800 --> 18:21.720]  the democratic party the scum of msnbc the scum of the southern prairie law center that funded and
[18:21.720 --> 18:26.680]  created the elohim city white supremacist command base ordered to stand down they knew the bombing
[18:26.680 --> 18:32.440]  was happened they were all part of it uh at the time the clintons were involved the deputy general
[18:32.440 --> 18:38.920]  ran the attack basically and these are horrible evil people that consciously know they're race
[18:38.920 --> 18:44.200]  pimping and want to race based america and that are betraying white christians that made us the
[18:44.200 --> 18:49.160]  openness freest country in the world and brought everybody together they have used our strength
[18:49.160 --> 18:55.480]  of true exclusiveness and diversity against us because they are led by a literal nazi collaborator
[18:55.480 --> 19:01.960]  who told 60 minutes he's proud of what he did rounding up more than 10 000 jews for nazis
[19:01.960 --> 19:07.400]  stealing everything they add and then sending them to death camps remember the left's main
[19:07.400 --> 19:14.280]  funder is george soros and that's why they've caught leftist groups funding attacks on jewish
[19:14.280 --> 19:20.680]  synagogues black churches and you name it over and over again is to keep jews blacks hispanics
[19:20.680 --> 19:28.200]  and others under the control of wicked evil parasitic nazi collaborators like soros who are
[19:28.200 --> 19:34.040]  the mafia who conduct false flags against minorities and hype up these events so they
[19:34.040 --> 19:39.320]  can keep them under their horrible slithering control just like soros fun of the air of spring
[19:39.320 --> 19:44.840]  and put radical muslims in charge they are committed to pure evil and when we come back
[19:44.840 --> 19:51.480]  i'm going to expose that and exactly how the washington post reports as well as the associated
[19:51.480 --> 19:56.840]  press as well as buzzfeed the trump was right the jewish center attacks were carried out by a jewish

[24:18.840 --> 24:26.120]  from the new york times to the jerusalem post alex jones uh you know quote says i won't even say it
[24:26.120 --> 24:35.880]  because i'll edit it out of context the jew word alex jones says that bleep carried out the situation
[24:35.880 --> 24:43.080]  virginia it's not what i said but that's how george soros operates is deceiving and the minute
[24:43.080 --> 24:48.200]  you understand that he's the captain of this you understand everything a literal nazi collaborator
[24:48.200 --> 24:53.480]  who helped round up close to 10 000 jews or more told 60 minutes he's not ashamed of it in fact
[24:53.480 --> 24:59.720]  he's proud of it because he's a survivor once i had a hollywood uh individual who had to be jewish
[24:59.720 --> 25:05.720]  i was talking to out in l.a he said don't be so hard on george soros he had to do it to survive
[25:05.720 --> 25:10.760]  and i said if people told me they were gonna kill me if i didn't help round up 10 000 of my fellow
[25:10.760 --> 25:17.320]  austinites regardless of what color they were i'd say pull the trigger but soros didn't say he was
[25:17.320 --> 25:22.760]  even sorry he said i did what i had to survive and i'm proud of it and then he went on to fund
[25:22.760 --> 25:28.360]  evil throughout his life and then it's so weird to have this weird jewish collaborator who does
[25:28.360 --> 25:32.520]  all this and does all this evil and overthrows countries and overthrows currencies and tries
[25:32.520 --> 25:37.560]  to destroy stable governments and puts radical muslims in charge and just has a track record of pure
[25:37.560 --> 25:45.080]  evil and then he funds media matters that puts out the talking points that are then the orders
[25:45.080 --> 25:48.120]  only when media matters puts it out because they know that's from the clintons and from
[25:48.120 --> 25:53.240]  podesta and from soros then the newspapers all put it out so i go oh look it's in media matters
[25:53.240 --> 25:57.880]  within two hours it'll be in 50 newspapers or 100 newspapers or a thousand newspapers sometimes
[25:57.880 --> 26:01.800]  which is great publicity for us because the fiction they put out about us isn't real
[26:02.440 --> 26:07.240]  and then folks just come to us and find the truth that i'm not for destroying israel i'm not for
[26:07.240 --> 26:12.840]  overthrowing israel uh i am pro israel everybody knows that i'm hated by the nazis for that doesn't
[26:12.840 --> 26:16.520]  mean i support all of israel's policies israel has different governments that come and go
[26:16.520 --> 26:23.560]  and that uh i support president trump and that president trump supports a good stable israel
[26:23.560 --> 26:28.600]  and a good stable middle east as well and that they're saying he's an anti-semite remember
[26:28.600 --> 26:33.720]  the headline six months ago from buzzfeed there was also daily beast they all said
[26:33.720 --> 26:40.280]  trump says jew attacks on jewish centers are false flag they want to say it's anti-semitism
[26:40.280 --> 26:44.920]  you had attacks on cemeteries attacks on synagogues hundreds and hundreds of bomb threats
[26:44.920 --> 26:50.840]  coordinated and the police caught a writer with again connections to groups funded
[26:50.840 --> 26:56.600]  by soros and the big left out coordinating it and believe me folks it wasn't just him
[26:56.600 --> 27:02.280]  from my intel in new york and new jersey and trump had jewish groups close to him he has a lot of
[27:02.280 --> 27:06.680]  advisors that are jewish americans that are patriots saying sir we believe this is leftist
[27:06.680 --> 27:12.200]  operations against you and against netanyahu because they knew the two were allied before
[27:12.200 --> 27:18.440]  trump even won so they're trying to overthrow netanyahu the same way it's not even about jews
[27:18.440 --> 27:24.440]  it's about politics and the left whether you're black white ispanic jewish chinese doesn't matter
[27:25.560 --> 27:29.960]  using race-based politics so we're putting together the videos of the poop swastika and
[27:29.960 --> 27:35.240]  all the fake stuff and jewish folks and white folks and black folks and chinese folks and everybody
[27:35.240 --> 27:41.880]  getting caught staging stuff everybody knows people like to frame up folks everybody knows
[27:41.880 --> 27:46.120]  there's been lots of cases of white women you know carving stuff on their face or back
[27:46.120 --> 27:51.720]  singing a bunch of black guys did it and then it turns out it's not true cops know half the time
[27:51.720 --> 27:56.600]  when there's some big outlandish story that happened it turns out it's fake i mean they know
[27:56.600 --> 28:00.920]  most of the time when somebody finds a pipe bomb it was them that did it okay i mean that's just
[28:00.920 --> 28:07.160]  basic criminology and it's not a reflection on jews as if jews are the only people to do this
[28:07.160 --> 28:14.200]  but george soros is a nazi collaborator he is a race-baiting radical muslim funding pig
[28:14.200 --> 28:21.960]  he is in the wiki leaks wanting to overthrow israel i'm not the one doing it and i said all that
[28:22.920 --> 28:29.560]  about them catching fbi people and leftist groups and jewish leftist groups posing as nazis and
[28:29.560 --> 28:35.000]  they've caught rabbis posing as nazis it's been all over the news so i'm gonna have a file folks
[28:35.000 --> 28:42.520]  go into the reuters thompson lexus nexus stuff in the next week i'm gonna pull hundreds hundreds

[28:52.760 --> 28:57.560]  got caught hiling hitler and events to blame right wingers and i'm just gonna show where hispanics
[28:57.560 --> 29:02.040]  got caught doing it and blacks got caught doing it and the whole false i mean bright marks written
[29:02.040 --> 29:09.240]  hundreds of articles the last two years showing all the fake stuff nine times out of ten it turns
[29:09.240 --> 29:14.760]  out to be completely fake and that's what i said and you've got the leftist mafia that's made up a
[29:14.760 --> 29:20.360]  lot of different people that goes out at stages racial attacks stirs up racial attacks or has
[29:20.360 --> 29:27.000]  police chiefs stand down and mayors stand down who bring in antifa to viciously attack and to cause
[29:27.000 --> 29:34.280]  a clash between racist white idiots and minority race-based morons to have a clash to then blame
[29:34.280 --> 29:39.880]  america for it to create racial divide create racial guilt so we get bullied into the agenda
[29:39.880 --> 29:46.840]  of accepting globalism and imploding economy and a new world order on the backs of it with scum like

[34:12.840 --> 34:17.640]  the snapshot of what we're dealing with all the race stuff is to divide and conquer us and divert us

[35:23.000 --> 35:28.200]  here in zimmermans shooting this live feed where we set this little makeshift studio the economist
[35:28.200 --> 35:34.200]  magazine this month the headline is roadkill all right so it's a weekly publication published by
[35:34.200 --> 35:39.320]  the rothschilds roadkill it shows a combustion engine looking like a dead animal spread on the
[35:39.320 --> 35:44.840]  road and it explains global government and how it's going to happen and how demographics how
[35:44.840 --> 35:50.200]  they're going to make uh people who aren't anglo race-based and tie them to demographics of carbon
[35:50.200 --> 35:55.320]  tax and so that there's no way trump long-term can stop them because it's totally race-based
[35:55.320 --> 36:01.240]  and i forgot to get the magazine over here but tomorrow so i'm gonna do uh yeah i think my
[36:01.240 --> 36:05.080]  wife's got it actually maybe you can see if you can find it real quick we know i think she's eating
[36:05.080 --> 36:09.240]  so i don't think it's in the room just just i'll show it tomorrow the point is it actually it actually
[36:09.240 --> 36:15.080]  says in another article we're going to get the white people it actually says because of demographics
[36:15.080 --> 36:20.200]  no one can stop it we are able to convert minorities to accept the policies of global
[36:20.200 --> 36:26.120]  government carbon taxes and elites running things it actually because elites do read
[36:26.120 --> 36:31.080]  and want to be elites do read the economist and so you're reading and it says elites run things
[36:31.080 --> 36:37.720]  and this elites it says don't be nervous our plan is going to work we've got the demographics of the
[36:37.720 --> 36:43.400]  non whites now again it's not that the minorities who are a majority outside the us are bad people
[36:43.400 --> 36:50.360]  it's that they've been targeted they've test brainwashed them and people are tribal
[36:50.920 --> 36:55.400]  and they actually say it doesn't matter we'll get our global government we'll cut everybody's
[36:55.400 --> 37:00.120]  resources off and when i got to this hotel they said would you like to make a green choice and have
[37:00.120 --> 37:05.880]  no no uh new sheets used to they said would you like to have it only every three days or ask for
[37:05.880 --> 37:10.360]  it now and i said no i want it all the time just to you know see how they'd act and they got all
[37:10.360 --> 37:16.360]  that's sure that's not good for the earth and then i noticed my bathtub was this big it was a large
[37:16.360 --> 37:21.720]  washcloth and i called him and they said yes sir that's for the earth you see so it's about you
[37:21.720 --> 37:26.280]  have less and less but you pay more and more Africans can't have cars Africans can't have
[37:26.280 --> 37:30.840]  air conditioning you can't either but it's not racist to tell Africans they can't be developed
[37:30.840 --> 37:39.880]  it's loving eugenics by the loving liberals on top who i know the top liberals in places like here
[37:41.320 --> 37:46.920]  in seattle know that they're brain bugs they know they're upper caste rulers they know they're like
[37:46.920 --> 37:51.640]  brahmins basically and they're setting up a class system they say they are in the light papers and
[37:51.640 --> 37:57.160]  they're the super hardcore racists i mean super hardcore racists they're all like six foot four

[38:40.200 --> 38:47.080]  carburetors it'll give you 200 300 horsepower the japanese had it 30 40 50 years ago depending on the
[38:47.080 --> 38:52.200]  unit of course there's other advanced technologies they're blocking but when they say electric cars
[38:52.200 --> 38:57.240]  and batteries they're going to make cars where they don't work anymore and they're not cost feasible
[38:57.240 --> 39:02.440]  so you only ride buses and trains so they can control where you live and what you do to get you
[39:02.440 --> 39:06.760]  off the land and it's all declassified it's all public that's what you got to start understanding

[43:26.200 --> 43:32.120]  the problem of whiteness uh on mtv is to try to create some actual racist white groups who have a
[43:32.120 --> 43:36.680]  right to demonstrate we have a right to speak out against them then you have the idiot antifa
[43:36.680 --> 43:43.080]  racist communist soros funded day of the dead group mainly white people running around screaming f

[45:20.920 --> 45:26.040]  called trump a racist they're calling him a nazi today on msnbc the little desperate potock from
[45:26.040 --> 45:30.440]  the southern prairie law center the southern prairie law center funded the nazis in eliam city

[45:34.600 --> 45:38.200]  they're the ones that need to be investigated notice they never sued me for saying that because
[45:38.200 --> 45:43.720]  we got the emails the eyewitnesses all of it okay i mean we talk about you know liberal groups
[45:43.720 --> 45:50.360]  staging nazi stuff good lord it's famous so they're desperate who cares if scum that call
[45:50.360 --> 45:55.080]  everybody racists keeps saying this i get though cancelling some of the meetups as she just went

[46:05.800 --> 46:09.480]  having little meetups are running to cool people that wanted to show us their business or show us
[46:09.480 --> 46:15.080]  their cows or show us their factory great hit show tens of millions of viewers uh for flyover
[46:15.080 --> 46:20.920]  america just an internet show that we do to show how great america is and bring us together so here
[46:20.920 --> 46:27.800]  is a cbs clip piece is an example of how they're targeting even mainline republican meetings now
[46:27.800 --> 46:33.160]  to bully everyone into going under the cultural left's control where they will then say okay we
[46:33.160 --> 46:40.600]  won't call you names and send antifa murderers to come after you if you submit and worship us in the
[46:40.600 --> 46:47.720]  racketeering operations that are cbs nbc abc cnn ms nbc and the other criminal organizations of
[46:47.720 --> 46:52.600]  known liars committed to lying to the american people and destroying our republic here's the clip
[46:53.720 --> 46:59.000]  a lot of attention since its east end offices first opened but now this building is scheduled
[46:59.000 --> 47:04.920]  to be the target of an alt right rally scheduled for this saturday so far people have been shocked
[47:04.920 --> 47:09.960]  they had no idea that this was taking place attorney and community activist felicity williams
[47:09.960 --> 47:15.800]  learned about the planned rally on the internet a facebook page for flyover america announced google
[47:15.800 --> 47:21.560]  offices here were included in a list of planned rallies for the weekend her concern was the city
[47:21.560 --> 47:26.360]  prepared after watching what happened this past weekend in charlottesville i hope that they are
[47:26.360 --> 47:31.400]  taking the necessary steps to prepare because again as i said i'm pretty sure charlottesville
[47:31.400 --> 47:37.880]  didn't anticipate what happened there happening in their city google is actually private property
[47:37.880 --> 47:42.680]  according to the city and so far no permit has been requested police will monitor any
[47:42.680 --> 47:47.560]  protest and take necessary precautions word of the planned rally is just beginning to
[47:47.560 --> 47:52.600]  spread in the area i'm concerned i mean we live in a place where everyone should have freedom of
[47:52.600 --> 47:57.480]  speech but it's not right so just because you have the right to say what you want you shouldn't
[47:57.480 --> 48:04.600]  i'm french and in france we we are aware to protest about everything and when we want we can
[48:04.600 --> 48:11.400]  protest the flyover america facebook page is already getting reactions to the idea of coming to pittsburgh
[48:11.400 --> 48:16.120]  those opposed to the rally are hoping to bring interested parties together to come up with a
[48:16.120 --> 48:20.520]  plan on how to address any issues that may arise we want to make sure that whatever
[48:20.520 --> 48:25.880]  action we plan that we are keeping people safe but we are still able to exercise our rights
[48:25.880 --> 48:29.240]  and to make a statement against this uh coming to coming to pittsburgh
[48:30.920 --> 48:35.240]  now that's pretty mild compared to msnbc and the scum i was talking about earlier
[48:35.240 --> 48:41.320]  saying trumps a hitler trumps a nazi that's what about scum these are useful idiot folks for the
[48:41.320 --> 48:45.880]  globalists but just buy into because they say flyover country and then you know connect it to
[48:45.880 --> 48:51.080]  uh what happened in charlottesville that somehow we people are coming with their nazi flags or
[48:51.080 --> 48:55.400]  something there when the google demonstrations were announced on info wars two weeks ago by
[48:55.400 --> 49:00.360]  mike sternovich to unify everybody against internet censorship but again everyone getting
[49:00.360 --> 49:04.760]  into this and panicking about it is exactly what the globalists want we need to continue
[49:04.760 --> 49:09.800]  demonstrations against google when i get back to austin i'm going to do one at google oh my gosh
[49:09.800 --> 49:14.360]  in america i'm gonna go down there and do it because it has to be done we have to exercise
[49:14.360 --> 49:19.400]  our free speech we have to expose that google is censoring us in cyberspace and we have to sue them
[49:20.200 --> 49:24.760]  so i guess they'll call my lawsuit you'll kkk or something because we're battling the kkk
[49:24.760 --> 49:28.040]  so we're going to skip this break so we have more time course he's popping in for five minutes
[49:28.040 --> 49:32.600]  at the start of the next hour to get into just briefly to the whole arpio situation and his
[49:32.600 --> 49:38.280]  article on info wars dot com but this is information warfare this is success uh milley what you've
[49:38.280 --> 49:43.240]  gone through being pepper sprayed attacked is much much worse than just dis info in the media this
[49:43.240 --> 49:47.800]  is what the left does is project on to everyone that they're racist i mean what do you expect them to
[49:47.800 --> 49:53.160]  do well i don't expect them to do anything different than what they're doing however
[49:53.720 --> 49:58.680]  what has alarmed me about what we're seeing with this march on google and pittsburgh and all the
[49:58.680 --> 50:04.600]  mainstream media coverage that has been very deceptive as painting this as an alt-right protest
[50:04.600 --> 50:09.960]  what's alarming me is that it's the exact same thing i saw leading up to the charlottesville
[50:09.960 --> 50:14.920]  protest the at the unite the right rally and the media coverage in the spin and the city plan
[50:14.920 --> 50:19.560]  i mean a nazi collaborator runs the left i mean they're going to do evil stuff that's what they
[50:19.560 --> 50:24.680]  do and they love if it alarms people they think i'll say more they'll even target you specifically
[50:24.680 --> 50:29.960]  and say you've killed children that's what they do exactly and what they did in charlottesville
[50:29.960 --> 50:34.840]  was just a test and now they want to duplicate that and repeat it over and over again across
[50:34.840 --> 50:40.920]  the united states they they've proven that they were successful in getting away with demonizing
[50:40.920 --> 50:45.800]  and yes there were some racist and extreme elements that you don't typically see out there
[50:45.800 --> 50:51.160]  on the right voicing some pretty bigoted things and i disagree with it and most of the trump
[50:51.160 --> 50:56.680]  supporters out there the more you say you disagree the more you say you disagree the more they'll
[50:56.680 --> 51:02.600]  say you said holly itler these are lying scum that funded the arab spring to kill over a million
[51:02.600 --> 51:08.360]  people they know full well they're they're leading that group in charlottesville they're running it
[51:08.360 --> 51:12.440]  they always run it it always comes out like trumps have the attack on the jewish centers
[51:12.440 --> 51:18.040]  he said that's the left to blame me and it turned out it was true millie well i i think it is to
[51:18.040 --> 51:25.320]  blame the right i mean and i think that this next march on google has been hijacked by the deep state
[51:25.320 --> 51:31.800]  i have a a statement here from the mayor of pittsburgh and he even says in his statement that
[51:31.800 --> 51:37.640]  he has been monitoring social media and intelligence reports regarding potential right wing protests
[51:37.640 --> 51:43.560]  this weekend in pittsburgh so he's talking about being briefed by intelligence now let me remind
[51:43.560 --> 51:48.920]  you guys this flyover police departments have an intelligence group yeah and that's part of police
[51:48.920 --> 51:52.440]  departments i mean intelligence is just going and reading the internet but yeah that's what i'm
[51:52.440 --> 51:57.880]  saying millie we're in a war we're taking america back they're going to frame all of us getting out
[51:57.880 --> 52:02.520]  on the street and taking action and and getting attention as evil so they can censor us in the
[52:02.520 --> 52:09.000]  real world in the third dimension and also censor us online exactly and they want us to react
[52:09.000 --> 52:13.000]  by going out there to stand up for the first amendment but essentially they're just going to
[52:13.000 --> 52:18.920]  use it to demonize trump and then if they can successfully demonize trump over the the appearance
[52:18.920 --> 52:26.040]  of a divided nation they will accomplish a win for whoever the next radical leftist progressive
[52:26.040 --> 52:32.360]  is that runs in 2020 so they're wanting us to win on the streets so that they can then win in the voter
[52:32.360 --> 52:37.160]  boot and that's why i did put out a video it's a little more complex in my in my view than that
[52:37.160 --> 52:41.480]  see they told trump to stop having rallies he wouldn't be president right now they said
[52:41.480 --> 52:45.160]  there's violence at your rallies they're blaming it on you they're saying you're a racist you need
[52:45.160 --> 52:49.880]  to stop the rallies and if you would have done that he would have lost i mean i i understand
[52:49.880 --> 52:54.600]  we've got to be wise about these things but we've got a document who does what we know what to watch
[52:54.600 --> 52:59.000]  for most these events we end up catching them before they even do it i don't think it's good
[52:59.000 --> 53:02.520]  to do it in democrat controlled cities you need to find out if the cops are going to protect you
[53:02.520 --> 53:08.600]  or stand down i think you should on both sides investigate and look at the angles but if we
[53:08.600 --> 53:13.320]  say that well oh they've got the propaganda upper hand and so we can't ever go out and demonstrate
[53:13.320 --> 53:17.560]  because they'll say we're a bad person they're going to say that in cyberspace and ban us there
[53:17.560 --> 53:22.200]  do we then stop being in cyberspace because yes they will not say anything about you if you never
[53:22.200 --> 53:27.160]  speak again if you get off the internet and if you get off the streets and if you just go submit
[53:27.160 --> 53:33.000]  they will leave you alone that that is true yeah i mean we do have to fight for the first amendment
[53:33.000 --> 53:37.720]  we do have to go out there and voice our concerns but as far as i'm saying with these particular
[53:37.720 --> 53:42.280]  events it just it looks like deep state has hijacked it and i'm really worried well of course
[53:42.280 --> 53:46.920]  no millie millie millie i'm not mad at you i'm just frustrated of course they've tried to hijack it
[53:46.920 --> 53:52.360]  but just because they engage us doesn't mean they've hijacked it then they'll spend it oh
[53:52.360 --> 53:55.000]  right wing's not going to protest anymore because they believe they'll get blamed
[53:56.120 --> 54:00.040]  of course we launch google protest and they're scared of it because they don't want any trust
[54:00.040 --> 54:03.960]  lawsuits and they don't want americans coming together against their violations of free speech
[54:03.960 --> 54:09.240]  and chinese style net censorship you're absolutely right millie that they are hijacking it that's
[54:09.240 --> 54:14.680]  why we've got to get more involved than ever and expose what they're doing and everybody should
[54:14.680 --> 54:19.640]  just go out to google at all times of the day stand up and do live feeds in front of them talking about
[54:19.640 --> 54:23.960]  the censorship they've done they can't stop individuals randomly going and doing things
[54:23.960 --> 54:29.880]  everywhere peacefully they're scared of us that's why they stage this in charlotte that's why they're
[54:29.880 --> 54:35.000]  going oh alt right was coming to your town even though sternovich said nine months ago i'm not
[54:35.000 --> 54:39.960]  alt right don't give me that name hillary i said that too i said we're the new right i'm not even
[54:39.960 --> 54:45.720]  that so the reason i'm going wild here is we've already been through all this before we've already
[54:45.720 --> 54:49.080]  gone out i've already been at callous demonstrations i've already i've already clashed with the
[54:49.080 --> 54:54.120]  communists i've already had the news say racist alex jones was out there attacking innocent people
[54:54.120 --> 54:59.080]  but the public knows they're liars millie and we get stronger because we don't let them break our
[54:59.080 --> 55:04.920]  will do you understand yes i understand and i do think the public needs to be made more aware and
[55:04.920 --> 55:11.480]  we need to literally get on the bullhorn and scream about how antifa are terrorists going out making
[55:11.480 --> 55:17.080]  threats thinking that they can just show up and cause violence attack people and then they can
[55:17.080 --> 55:23.320]  successfully shut down free speech now we have these democratic cities with these liberal mayors
[55:23.320 --> 55:27.320]  that are going to have their police stand down and it's going to be the same thing with charlotte's
[55:27.320 --> 55:35.080]  millie millie millie and the left clashing you did a great job gavin did a great job you get you know
[55:35.080 --> 55:40.120]  50 gold stars here exactly what i'm saying is let's not let them grab victory from the jaws of their
[55:40.120 --> 55:46.520]  defeat you as a woman with just a camera guy i don't expect you and i've said don't go to these
[55:46.520 --> 55:50.840]  things you think they're dangerous reassess if you're just going to hey meet up group let's go out
[55:50.840 --> 55:55.400]  in front of google and just meet knowing 10 guys are going to show up 10 people just friendly folks
[55:55.400 --> 55:59.960]  hey we want free speech you are absolutely right we have to plan this out more now because they've
[55:59.960 --> 56:04.760]  created a climate of anti-free speech and that you at a level at a gut level know you shouldn't go
[56:04.760 --> 56:10.280]  to google by yourself with just you and gavin i totally and completely agree with your gut level
[56:10.280 --> 56:14.840]  i'm just saying we have to continue to plan even bigger demonstrations at google now more than ever
[56:14.840 --> 56:20.680]  and be very clear and use the publicity we'll get at these events to point out what really happened
[56:20.680 --> 56:25.800]  and take the narrative back from them it's by engaging but engaging smartly that we do it
[56:25.800 --> 56:30.200]  now tell folks about flyover country and how folks can follow us right there on facebook
[56:31.160 --> 56:37.960]  well flyover america was designed to basically go around and give trump supporters deplorables
[56:37.960 --> 56:43.480]  that have been demonized by the mainstream media an opportunity to tell them their side of the
[56:43.480 --> 56:48.200]  story because of all the media demonization of trump supporters saying that they're all racist
[56:48.200 --> 56:54.600]  bigots and and horrible people so that's what we were doing we had already had multiple events and
[56:54.600 --> 56:59.560]  you know the info wars listeners and trump supporters horrible events with whites and blacks
[56:59.560 --> 57:04.440]  and Hispanics eating barbecue together and playing playing music and having fun and little kids and
[57:04.440 --> 57:09.480]  puppy dogs one dozens and dozens of videos with millions of views good wholesomeness and that's
[57:09.480 --> 57:14.520]  why they watched you who you are and knew you were good and wanted to go lie about you because
[57:14.520 --> 57:20.040]  they don't like the fact you're good and they're the bad people not you millie exactly and they
[57:20.040 --> 57:25.080]  want to essentially shut down our flyover america tour because they think if they can show up to all
[57:25.080 --> 57:30.920]  of our meet and greet events and terrorize people then they can stop us from getting that message
[57:30.920 --> 57:35.960]  out with millie antifa is very slow it takes them a week to get going they didn't even show up the
[57:35.960 --> 57:39.800]  first night at the thing and charlottesville you're gonna be fine probably not at the google you're
[57:39.800 --> 57:44.120]  probably smart to you know hold back at that one or just cover it or whatever but i'm just saying
[57:44.120 --> 57:47.880]  overall you don't have to lead the thing you're doing a great job just report on it just break
[57:47.880 --> 57:52.680]  it down we love having you on every day it's so such a great idea you guys had for flyover american
[57:52.680 --> 57:58.600]  you and gavin who had the idea it was you were gavin um it was kind of a mutual idea between the
[57:58.600 --> 58:03.960]  both of us and by no means am i gonna go just quit and give up on the first amendment and the right
[58:03.960 --> 58:09.160]  for peaceful protest i'm going to be out there peacefully protest you're raising the alarm that
[58:09.160 --> 58:12.920]  they're stealing your identity you're raising the alarm they're trying to steal our identity

[01:00:10.520 --> 01:00:19.160]  jones show and now your host olyn shroyer info wars dot com dr jerry coursey has been all over
[01:00:19.160 --> 01:00:25.320]  the sheriff joe story i guess it was about a week ago dr coursey you were releasing the story how
[01:00:25.320 --> 01:00:28.920]  the white house was keeping this information from trump then you had the story about how they
[01:00:28.920 --> 01:00:32.920]  were trying to get the information to trump now it's gotten a step further the mainstream media
[01:00:32.920 --> 01:00:37.400]  has picked this up and it looks like trump is even considering a pardon dr coursey what do you know
[01:00:38.600 --> 01:00:44.840]  well i i think on your right i mean the reporting we did brought the attention of the white house
[01:00:44.840 --> 01:00:51.160]  to the fact that sheriff arpaio had been convicted of this misdemeanor criminal contempt charge
[01:00:51.960 --> 01:00:59.400]  he had been denied a jury trial he'd been charged on the wrong statute the correct statute the
[01:00:59.400 --> 01:01:04.840]  statute limitations had run out and so what we're facing now is that this is really a revenge
[01:01:04.840 --> 01:01:12.040]  prosecution that was started by the obama department of justice really punishing sheriff arpaio
[01:01:12.040 --> 01:01:19.640]  joe both for his enforcing the immigration laws and is investigating a brock obama's birth certificate
[01:01:20.520 --> 01:01:27.960]  tom pares was behind this prosecution he's now the head of the dnc he was is a la rosa radical
[01:01:27.960 --> 01:01:35.800]  lawyer who would come came comes out of maryland and he had a real grudge on joe arpaio really
[01:01:35.800 --> 01:01:42.200]  determined to prosecute him so this is information now because of our reporting at info wars has
[01:01:42.200 --> 01:01:47.720]  reached the white house and the most recent reports are that um president trump is planning to go down
[01:01:47.720 --> 01:01:56.440]  to arizona next tuesday august 22nd and that our sheriff arpaio might be pardoned uh before that
[01:01:56.440 --> 01:02:02.600]  trip occurs or maybe even on the day of that trip but clearly we have the attention of the white house
[01:02:02.600 --> 01:02:07.800]  and it's now being reported by the mainstream media do you expect president trump to make a
[01:02:07.800 --> 01:02:12.920]  statement somewhere along the lines of this witch hunt against arpaio and why it happened
[01:02:13.800 --> 01:02:19.560]  i think so and i think it's really a egregious case you've got a situation here where
[01:02:20.600 --> 01:02:28.040]  an order was given by a court to stop certain practices of you know stopping cars in the highway
[01:02:28.040 --> 01:02:35.080]  and uh investigating the occupants of the car looking for illegal immigrants saying that you
[01:02:35.080 --> 01:02:40.520]  can't stop the car based on the fact that the driver occupants are hispanic and of course
[01:02:40.520 --> 01:02:47.080]  sheriff arpaio always denied that that was the motive behind the car stops and in fact you know
[01:02:47.080 --> 01:02:52.120]  he was trying to enforce the immigration laws so that if there was a car stopped for a legitimate
[01:02:52.120 --> 01:02:58.760]  reason other than race and the people in the car were investigated in terms of who they were
[01:02:59.800 --> 01:03:04.040]  yes well then immigration laws could be enforced and the sheriff arpaio was determined to do so
[01:03:04.680 --> 01:03:10.360]  and the obama administration was trying to back law enforcement off enforcing immigration laws
[01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:16.280]  and that's continuing with the obama holdovers in the department of justice that now still want to
[01:03:16.280 --> 01:03:23.320]  prosecute sheriff arpaio and a judge who seems politically biased against arpaio and really
[01:03:23.320 --> 01:03:28.600]  did not take into consideration the evidence that occurred at the bench trial this whole thing to
[01:03:28.600 --> 01:03:34.040]  me looks like a witch hunt it looks like it's a politically motivated prosecution and it's one
[01:03:34.040 --> 01:03:41.480]  in which sheriff arpaio deserves a pardon because truly he's 85 years old he's had a 40-year history
[01:03:41.480 --> 01:03:48.120]  in law enforcement he's never had a blemish on his record i think this is a real hero of law
[01:03:48.120 --> 01:03:54.840]  enforcement that president a campaign for president trump early on in january 2016 and president
[01:03:54.840 --> 01:04:02.440]  trump i think now needs to acknowledge that joe arpaio is being um prosecuted unfairly jerry
[01:04:02.440 --> 01:04:06.200]  we're short on time who in the white house was responsible for keeping this from getting to trump
[01:04:06.200 --> 01:04:13.240]  well i'm not sure but i mean i think the part of the problem with uh general kelly is he's going
[01:04:13.240 --> 01:04:21.800]  to um try to keep any news coming from info wars or any of the other channels that are really in
[01:04:21.800 --> 01:04:30.200]  touch with uh don trump's base uh from reaching donald trump and insulate him to a prepackage
[01:04:30.200 --> 01:04:35.640]  kind of mainstream media approach to the news um i don't think it's going to be successful
[01:04:35.640 --> 01:04:41.240]  i think donald trump uh follows uh info wars he certainly followed the reporting that i've done
[01:04:41.240 --> 01:04:46.920]  over the years and i think this case and sheriff arpaio is a clear indication uh that this is the
[01:04:46.920 --> 01:04:51.240]  case and and i think roger stone would support that and thanks to our audience too we can get
[01:04:51.240 --> 01:04:59.000]  these messages to trump we'll be right back why is the fungus why is the mold why is the yeast

[01:08:22.440 --> 01:08:31.640]  though many can't find it on a map boy if that doesn't encapsulate the ignorance of the general
[01:08:31.640 --> 01:08:37.560]  population and the general public of america i really don't know what does other than the
[01:08:37.560 --> 01:08:44.280]  kardashian tv show ratings i'm now joined by michael snider who is the author of this article
[01:08:44.280 --> 01:08:48.760]  50 percent of americans favor a preemptive strike on north korea even though they can't find it on
[01:08:48.760 --> 01:08:54.200]  a map of the world michael it's funny i remember a similar situation just a few years ago with
[01:08:54.200 --> 01:09:01.160]  crimea when you had all these fake news pundits telling you about crimea telling liberals about
[01:09:01.160 --> 01:09:05.560]  crimea and then the liberals wanted to do something about crimea you said well where is it on a map
[01:09:05.560 --> 01:09:11.880]  and they had no idea it's funny how that works isn't it it really is and so jimmy kimmel went out
[01:09:11.880 --> 01:09:16.760]  the on hollywood boulevard and held up a map first he asked people should we attack north korea
[01:09:16.760 --> 01:09:21.080]  and a lot of them said oh yeah let's attack north korea even if they don't attack us first oh yeah
[01:09:21.080 --> 01:09:25.560]  yeah let's attack north korea let's bomb north korea you know let's bomb them off the map but
[01:09:25.560 --> 01:09:30.040]  then he held up a map of the world a blank map of the world and said okay can you point to north
[01:09:30.040 --> 01:09:35.640]  korea for me and some people were pointing to spots in the middle east some pointed toward australia
[01:09:35.640 --> 01:09:40.280]  some even pointed up at canada they said is it up there you know the ignorance of the american
[01:09:40.280 --> 01:09:47.720]  people sometimes is just staggering well it's funny you can you can make these videos like this
[01:09:47.720 --> 01:09:51.880]  the one where they can't find north korean on a map but they want to bomb it or you can do videos
[01:09:51.880 --> 01:09:58.680]  of people leaving the polls that voted for obama and you can read off the list of what mccain
[01:09:58.680 --> 01:10:02.280]  actually supports or what romney actually supports and they're like yeah i support that too and they're
[01:10:02.280 --> 01:10:07.400]  like oh oops sorry i wrote the republican guy i'm sorry about that how do we beat this because
[01:10:07.400 --> 01:10:11.960]  you have another story that says if you stand with trump please support team trump candidates
[01:10:11.960 --> 01:10:16.600]  for congress i completely agree i think the 2018 midterm elections are the biggest elections
[01:10:16.600 --> 01:10:23.960]  since the 2016 presidential elections and possibly even bigger but with such an uninformed electorate
[01:10:23.960 --> 01:10:29.640]  and uninformed public how do we get people to know who's behind trump how do we get people
[01:10:29.640 --> 01:10:35.080]  to know who the right person to elect is well we've got to educate people and so that's why
[01:10:35.080 --> 01:10:40.440]  i love what you're doing oh and with omar navarro out in california we'll get behind him trying to
[01:10:40.440 --> 01:10:46.280]  unseat maxine waters with a pro trump candidate similar thing happening up in wisconsin with paul
[01:10:46.280 --> 01:10:52.360]  nailin trying to unseat paul ryan with a pro trump candidate so what we i what i would love to see
[01:10:52.360 --> 01:10:56.840]  is all of us that are pro trump because we can't just use a republican label because we got republicans
[01:10:56.840 --> 01:11:02.200]  that are pro trump but we got a lot of republicans that want to stab trump in the back in fact there's
[01:11:02.200 --> 01:11:06.360]  a big time ryan all about to jump in the race up here in idaho's first congressional district
[01:11:06.360 --> 01:11:11.560]  where i'm running and if he gets in he'll stab trump in the back at every opportunity and he's
[01:11:11.560 --> 01:11:16.040]  probably going to be my primary opponent and so that's why it's so imperative that you know we let
[01:11:16.040 --> 01:11:21.000]  people know hey i'm pro trump if i get in if omar navarro gets in if paul nailin gets in
[01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:24.760]  we're going to have trumps back we're going to try to shut these investigations down we're going to
[01:11:24.760 --> 01:11:30.440]  try to protect trump from impeachment because you know what the i believe the 2018 midterm elections
[01:11:30.440 --> 01:11:35.800]  are going to be the most important midterm elections in modern american history and if the
[01:11:35.800 --> 01:11:39.880]  democrats of course if the democrats get the house and the senate they're going to impeach trump
[01:11:39.880 --> 01:11:45.320]  they're already saying it so it's going to be a done deal so it's imperative that we keep republicans
[01:11:45.320 --> 01:11:49.720]  in control but even if we maintain the status quo and we still have a whole bunch of establishment
[01:11:49.720 --> 01:11:54.200]  republicans in there they might impeach trump anyway and because there's a lot of them that are
[01:11:54.200 --> 01:11:59.720]  like john mccain that'll stab trump in the back at every opportunity so what we need to do we need
[01:11:59.720 --> 01:12:04.760]  to educate the public somehow we need to get all the pro trump candidates working together i've been
[01:12:04.760 --> 01:12:11.000]  using hashtag team trump on twitter to try to get the word out but we need to get all of us under
[01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:15.720]  a single banner working together getting the word out across the nation saying hey we're pro trump
[01:12:15.720 --> 01:12:21.160]  we love liberty and freedom we're running on a ron paul platform we're we're we we believe in the
[01:12:21.160 --> 01:12:26.120]  u.s constitution we don't want to go to war you know and and all these things that set us apart
[01:12:26.120 --> 01:12:31.480]  from regular republicans we need to get this information out there well i gotta be honest
[01:12:31.480 --> 01:12:37.560]  if we have fair elections in 2018 i i literally have zero worry that democrats are going to gain
[01:12:37.560 --> 01:12:42.040]  the house or senate i mean literally zero i think the democrats if anything might be a completely
[01:12:42.040 --> 01:12:47.880]  dead party after the 2020 presidential election but we'll see what path they choose what i'm concerned
[01:12:47.880 --> 01:12:54.040]  about because i agree with you about uniting as trump supporters and using that momentum to
[01:12:54.760 --> 01:12:59.560]  ensure that we have a good congress for the next congress but what i see coming down the pike
[01:12:59.560 --> 01:13:04.840]  are people attacking you saying you're alt right we're seeing how they're trying to demonize the
[01:13:04.840 --> 01:13:12.040]  alt right something they created to pose against their other creative group antifa and thus try
[01:13:12.040 --> 01:13:16.120]  to spark the civil war that's how they're doing this and also another thing i'm worried about
[01:13:16.120 --> 01:13:21.880]  is fake trumpers i can see them posing fake trumpers that are really gop establishment members
[01:13:21.880 --> 01:13:27.720]  trying to get in there and to try to sully trump's regime from a republican perspective how do you
[01:13:27.720 --> 01:13:33.960]  avoid them trying to demonize you by labeling labeling you alt right and how can we tell a fake
[01:13:33.960 --> 01:13:41.880]  trooper from a real trooper well the left is gonna the left is already been attacking me my wife
[01:13:41.880 --> 01:13:45.800]  even my two-year-old daughter and they've been caught they've already been calling us all sorts of
[01:13:45.800 --> 01:13:50.120]  names now michael they're attacking your wife and daughter because they're tolerant and they
[01:13:50.120 --> 01:13:57.000]  want to treat everyone fairly okay so i come on oh it's true and i just got an email this morning
[01:13:57.000 --> 01:14:01.720]  saying i was a nazi i wasn't even fit to live in this country and so that that's what they're
[01:14:01.720 --> 01:14:06.920]  going to do so we can't stop the attacks but what we can do is we can scream bloody murder
[01:14:06.920 --> 01:14:10.360]  and educate people so that's what that's what you guys are doing every day with the show
[01:14:10.360 --> 01:14:14.520]  and that's a big part of the reason i'm running because we need people to run and some will win
[01:14:14.520 --> 01:14:18.440]  some will lose we need people literally to run all over the country or else we're going to get bad
[01:14:18.440 --> 01:14:23.320]  people into office but a big part of running for office is educating people because when you run
[01:14:23.320 --> 01:14:28.280]  for office you get a platform and whether you win or you lose you're going to talk to thousands if
[01:14:28.280 --> 01:14:33.240]  not ultimately millions of people for the bigger campaigns and people are going to hear the message
[01:14:33.240 --> 01:14:38.600]  they're going to get educated so part of this is an education process of what we're trying to do
[01:14:38.600 --> 01:14:43.080]  get the truth out and now as far as fake trumpers you know we're just going to have to try to weed
[01:14:43.080 --> 01:14:47.640]  them out the best we can but we know who Omar Navarro is we know who paul nailing is we know
[01:14:47.640 --> 01:14:51.560]  you guys know me because i've been my articles have been on info wars dot com for the last seven
[01:14:51.560 --> 01:14:56.920]  years i i couldn't run away from what i believe that if i tried yeah we know and and even whether
[01:14:56.920 --> 01:15:00.760]  you like them or not running you know ted and ted new jit you know a kid rock these are just people
[01:15:00.760 --> 01:15:07.400]  that you know i suppose now what actions are you taking to try to unite people that are behind
[01:15:07.400 --> 01:15:13.000]  trump running for congress what what steps have you taken to try to help us to to know who these
[01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:19.640]  people are know who to vote for yeah well if you go on twitter and you go under team trump
[01:15:19.640 --> 01:15:25.400]  but that's one of the hashtags that we're trying to use to get us all together to to unite us and
[01:15:25.400 --> 01:15:30.520]  and even before i started running back in may if you go back and look on the economic collapse
[01:15:30.520 --> 01:15:36.600]  blog dot com i was urging pro trump candidates to run all over the country and so i've been hearing
[01:15:36.600 --> 01:15:41.320]  some people from across the country that even running on the local level under a pro trump
[01:15:41.320 --> 01:15:45.960]  banner so i'm i've been actively trying not just with my websites but on radio and television all
[01:15:45.960 --> 01:15:51.320]  across america trying to recruit pro trump candidates to run because the big problem is
[01:15:51.320 --> 01:15:56.120]  we don't have enough of us yet yeah we got a few we got oma navarro paul nailing but literally we
[01:15:56.120 --> 01:16:01.960]  want to challenge every house seat in the entire country you want to fly against yeah we want but
[01:16:01.960 --> 01:16:06.680]  not just democrats but republicans because we've got these rhinos they betrayed us over and over
[01:16:06.680 --> 01:16:11.480]  again they betrayed trump over and over again but the only way we're going to get them out is if we
[01:16:11.480 --> 01:16:15.960]  get someone to run so the key is the republican primaries you know a lot of people are talking about
[01:16:15.960 --> 01:16:22.760]  november 2018 but for example my primaries in may 2018 and across the country in many areas of the
[01:16:22.760 --> 01:16:29.240]  country less than 10 percent of the population of a state will will vote in a republican primary
[01:16:29.240 --> 01:16:36.040]  so if we get just the info wars audience energized and fired up to vote and get 50 60 70 percent of
[01:16:36.040 --> 01:16:42.600]  us to go out and vote we can literally take over these primaries put in info wars candidates
[01:16:42.600 --> 01:16:47.960]  pro trump candidates liberty and freedom candidates ron paul candidates into these positions people
[01:16:47.960 --> 01:16:54.280]  don't understand because now the info wars audience has gotten so large and so powerful and had a huge
[01:16:54.280 --> 01:17:00.120]  impact for trump but these primaries a lot less people vote so your vote could count four or five
[01:17:00.120 --> 01:17:04.920]  times as much just because most people aren't voting so people get educated about when the
[01:17:04.920 --> 01:17:10.040]  primary is who the pro trump candidate and you go vote we could literally start taking over the
[01:17:10.040 --> 01:17:16.440]  republican party if we just get energized and motivated and galvanized to go vote yeah what
[01:17:16.440 --> 01:17:20.360]  you just covered is actually a very key point because a lot of these candidates that i'm talking
[01:17:20.360 --> 01:17:25.400]  to like yourself have said that our biggest concerns are not in the actual elections our biggest
[01:17:25.400 --> 01:17:31.080]  concerns is the democrat tactics or or my my republican tactics that they might use in the
[01:17:31.080 --> 01:17:37.400]  primaries to try to bring people in to try to uh rig the delegates this is something that we know
[01:17:37.400 --> 01:17:41.560]  they do this is something they do in the congressional elections as well i am hearing that that's a
[01:17:41.560 --> 01:17:50.200]  concern from other candidates that i've talked into as well so i guess the answer is to like you
[01:17:50.200 --> 01:17:55.720]  said be informed know the dates you really need to know these dates know the dates of the primaries
[01:17:55.720 --> 01:18:02.760]  is show up and show up in force and maybe even you know i don't understand have you tried to debate
[01:18:02.760 --> 01:18:06.600]  the the people that you're running against have you guys ever brought a debate to the uh to the
[01:18:06.600 --> 01:18:12.200]  front as a as a topic for discussion i'm going to be trying to debate my fellow candidates as
[01:18:12.200 --> 01:18:17.640]  much as possible now i've the race is very young i've only been i only announced july fourth and
[01:18:17.640 --> 01:18:22.200]  so far um you know the race is just getting started so whenever there's a forum a debate i'm
[01:18:22.200 --> 01:18:26.520]  going to be there to debate the other candidates because we have the strongest message and we're
[01:18:26.520 --> 01:18:31.080]  going to win because when you compare the message of the republican establishment against us i mean
[01:18:31.080 --> 01:18:35.320]  we win hands down yeah and you don't want to hear from another establishment republican telling you
[01:18:35.320 --> 01:18:40.040]  that they're going to repeal obama care and then not do it i mean you got to get some of the mitch
[01:18:40.040 --> 01:18:47.640]  mcconnell paul ryan i'm sorry michael go ahead oh you're right you're right we've seen a betray us
[01:18:47.640 --> 01:18:53.720]  over and over again with obama care you know john mccain he ran in 2010 on repealing obama care
[01:18:53.720 --> 01:19:00.040]  then in 2016 uh he he said oh i'm leading the fight to repeal obama care and then but then he betrayed
[01:19:00.040 --> 01:19:03.960]  us and they you know and then the republican establishment they're blocking the wall they're
[01:19:03.960 --> 01:19:10.600]  blocking trump's tax cut tax cuts they're blocking trump on immigration if trump is going to be a
[01:19:10.600 --> 01:19:14.760]  successful president the number one factor the number one determining factor is going to be the
[01:19:14.760 --> 01:19:20.440]  composition of congress and so it's absolutely imperative we get him some friends in 2018 because
[01:19:20.440 --> 01:19:25.160]  if we don't what the elite want to do they want to get trump out of office they want to remove
[01:19:25.160 --> 01:19:29.320]  him however we they can and then you know what they're going to do after they get trump out of
[01:19:29.320 --> 01:19:33.400]  office they're going to come after us it's just not going to return to normal they understand the
[01:19:33.400 --> 01:19:37.960]  power that we have and they're going to come after info wars they're going to come after me so we've
[01:19:37.960 --> 01:19:43.640]  got to win this battle and we can't have these cuck servitives in there that are going to tiptoe
[01:19:43.640 --> 01:19:47.160]  on eggshells because they don't want to offend people because of the pc culture that's been
[01:19:47.160 --> 01:19:53.400]  existent in dc for so long no we've smashed the pc culture now let's smash the establishment

[01:24:10.520 --> 01:24:17.320]  joined by michael snider we discussed hashtag support team trump on twitter to make sure
[01:24:17.320 --> 01:24:23.320]  that we get the right candidates in congress in the midterm elections i want to change pass here
[01:24:23.320 --> 01:24:27.800]  for a second michael and let's talk about some economic news you do run the website economic
[01:24:27.800 --> 01:24:35.640]  collapse blog.com a lot of the economic markets expert experts that i've been talking to have
[01:24:35.640 --> 01:24:41.000]  been saying not to get so excited over the stock market getting up saying not to get so excited
[01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:45.080]  over all these booms not to get so excited over all these graphs you see going up that it's just a
[01:24:45.080 --> 01:24:50.440]  bubble that it's not actually it's not actually real it's more based on hype what are your thoughts on
[01:24:50.440 --> 01:24:55.400]  that yeah the number one reason why the stock market has been going up is because of global
[01:24:55.400 --> 01:24:59.720]  central banks which has been pumping trillions of dollars into the system and not just a federal
[01:24:59.720 --> 01:25:04.840]  reserve but for example the swiss national bank during the months of january february march alone
[01:25:04.840 --> 01:25:10.040]  they purchased more than four million shares of apple stock so if i buy a couple shares of apple
[01:25:10.040 --> 01:25:15.400]  you buy some sell some shares of apple that that doesn't matter when you got the swiss national bank
[01:25:15.400 --> 01:25:20.920]  their central bank buying four million shares and also the swiss national bank owns more publicly
[01:25:20.920 --> 01:25:25.800]  traded shares of facebook now than mark zuckerberg does it's crazy or you got the bank of japan they've
[01:25:25.800 --> 01:25:31.720]  been buying up so much shares shamelessly that now they're a top five owner in more than 80 large
[01:25:32.520 --> 01:25:37.000]  companies over in japan so it's these central banks that have been pumping it up and they can
[01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:41.480]  deflate the bubble too in fact in september september is the very first time the federal
[01:25:41.480 --> 01:25:46.040]  reserve is supposed to start rolling back their balance sheet now they say okay we've been we've
[01:25:46.040 --> 01:25:50.360]  been you know buying all these stocks and bonds now we're going to start rolling it back we're
[01:25:50.360 --> 01:25:55.320]  going to start unwinding our balance sheet and that many believe that is going to have a huge
[01:25:55.320 --> 01:26:00.360]  impact on the financial markets because the financial markets have become completely disconnected
[01:26:00.360 --> 01:26:05.320]  from economic reality we're already seeing a recession in the restaurant industry auto sales
[01:26:05.320 --> 01:26:09.640]  are way down this year we you know there's all kinds of red flags going up in terms of the real
[01:26:09.640 --> 01:26:14.840]  economy but the financial markets have been in this giant bubble primarily because of the central
[01:26:14.840 --> 01:26:21.960]  banks also corporate buybacks for for years corporations were buying back tremendous amounts
[01:26:21.960 --> 01:26:28.280]  of their stock unprecedented in history but now corporate buybacks are starting to fall
[01:26:28.280 --> 01:26:33.080]  and that's a sign that the market may be starting to turn i'm actually seeing the service industry
[01:26:33.080 --> 01:26:37.000]  having a boom right now and that seems to be having the biggest boom you're saying you you're
[01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:41.960]  not seeing that you're disagreeing with that well oh it may be locally but overall in the entire
[01:26:41.960 --> 01:26:46.520]  country restaurant traffic has fallen over the last couple years in fact that you know
[01:26:46.520 --> 01:26:52.200]  restaurant same-source sales are down something like 17 months in a row and so the restaurants
[01:26:52.200 --> 01:26:56.840]  nationally are actually having a tough time now down there in texas because of the oil and everything
[01:26:56.840 --> 01:27:01.880]  you guys may be seeing some good things but now as a whole nationally yeah the restaurant industry
[01:27:01.880 --> 01:27:07.560]  is really uh you know in a recession same thing with the retail industry the we're on pace for
[01:27:07.560 --> 01:27:14.760]  this year for more retail locations more retail stores to shut down then that is more attributed
[01:27:14.760 --> 01:27:21.960]  to amazon which in the last month i think took over like 30 percent of the market something
[01:27:21.960 --> 01:27:26.680]  ridiculous amazon took over on the retail and i actually i don't know i you're the expert on this
[01:27:26.680 --> 01:27:31.080]  economicclabsblog.com but i actually think that in the next six months and i don't claim to be a
[01:27:31.080 --> 01:27:34.840]  market expert but i actually think that the service industry is going to come back and that it's
[01:27:34.840 --> 01:27:38.680]  going to wait to see that uptick i think that might be one of the only industries where we see a real
[01:27:38.680 --> 01:27:43.400]  uptick that isn't something like this and i want to hear your thoughts on this headline this broke
[01:27:43.400 --> 01:27:50.040]  on zero hedge today record number of fund managers say stocks are overvalued as they rush to buy
[01:27:50.040 --> 01:27:57.240]  nasdaq and i think that's more what i'm seeing the experts um elude to that they're being overvalued
[01:27:57.240 --> 01:28:03.960]  over height oh you're right price earnings ratios for example the cyclically adjusted price to earnings
[01:28:03.960 --> 01:28:10.040]  ratio put out by robert schiller of yale university the only time it's been this high in our history
[01:28:10.040 --> 01:28:15.480]  we're right before the 1929 crash right before the dot com bubble burst or even higher than we were
[01:28:15.480 --> 01:28:20.760]  before the last financial crisis or you look at price to sales ratios because earnings can be
[01:28:20.760 --> 01:28:26.360]  manipulated but you can't manipulate sales because if you manipulate sales numbers you go to prison
[01:28:26.360 --> 01:28:32.760]  so but the price to sales ratios in terms of stocks are the highest they've ever been in us now do you
[01:28:32.760 --> 01:28:37.960]  think this could be a big issue for trump in the in the in the future if we actually see these big
[01:28:37.960 --> 01:28:42.520]  hyped stock market records actually collapse and end up being a bad thing for the economy how can
[01:28:42.520 --> 01:28:48.440]  trump get ahead of this before they they demonize him for that yeah well you know trump is unfortunately
[01:28:48.440 --> 01:28:53.320]  i believe been taking credit for the stock market rise oh yeah i think he should have been more
[01:28:53.320 --> 01:28:57.560]  cautious there because when it falls well then they're gonna say you took the credit you get the
[01:28:57.560 --> 01:29:01.240]  blame and they're gonna point the fingers at him but it's not going to have really anything to do
[01:29:01.240 --> 01:29:06.600]  with trump because so much of trump's agenda tax cuts and so forth hasn't even been implemented
[01:29:06.600 --> 01:29:11.960]  but really this is all about the central banks and that's why beforehand i'm trying to get people
[01:29:11.960 --> 01:29:16.600]  to understand it's the federal reserve it's the central banks that have caused it so when it burst
[01:29:16.600 --> 01:29:21.240]  finally we can get people to understand let's get off this roller coaster ride 18 different
[01:29:21.240 --> 01:29:27.160]  recessions and or depression since the fed was created in 1913 we've got to shut down the federal
[01:29:27.160 --> 01:29:31.960]  reserve like ron paul you know was saying you know back when he was running for president i'm
[01:29:31.960 --> 01:29:36.680]  running on a ron paul platform and one of the main points on the platform i'm running on we've
[01:29:36.680 --> 01:29:41.960]  got to shut down the federal reserve because until we do we're going to keep having these booms and
[01:29:41.960 --> 01:29:47.880]  busts we're going to keep staying with our class blog dot com empires on the run we right back
[01:29:47.880 --> 01:29:54.520]  alex jones and the gcn radio network

[01:32:00.280 --> 01:32:05.160]  and in the last four or five years doing more and more research i came across the fact that
[01:32:05.160 --> 01:32:11.320]  the elite establishment is fully aware of the fact that our ancient ancestors in many cases had much
[01:32:11.320 --> 01:32:17.560]  better nutrition than we do today and our ancient ancestors sought out the bones of the animals that
[01:32:17.560 --> 01:32:23.560]  they were hunting killing and then processing and so i set out to develop caveman but to not just have
[01:32:23.560 --> 01:32:30.840]  concentrated bone broth from chicken but seven other superfood ingredients known for cleansing
[01:32:30.840 --> 01:32:36.280]  and supercharging the body at the same time info wars isn't just fighting the globalist we're

[01:33:03.800 --> 01:33:11.880]  live from the info wars dot com studios you're listening to the alex joneshow and now your
[01:33:11.880 --> 01:33:19.080]  host owin shroyer all right i've got stacks of news all kinds of breaking news as well
[01:33:20.760 --> 01:33:31.720]  folks literally here did he the crew has a stack of 30 stories about leftists if you want to if
[01:33:31.720 --> 01:33:38.920]  you want to call it that communists antifa liberals you can label people it's just all labels
[01:33:38.920 --> 01:33:46.520]  they're all nutjobs they're all crazy they're all larpers they're all being programmed by media to
[01:33:46.520 --> 01:33:54.520]  do all of this fake news motivated and they think they're doing it for good they really think that
[01:33:54.520 --> 01:33:59.720]  they're going to demonize the white man or demonize this man or demonize that group
[01:34:01.400 --> 01:34:07.560]  by getting their fake hoax out there and the reason why alex wants this to be hammered home
[01:34:07.560 --> 01:34:15.000]  so much is because with everything we just saw in charlottesville people need to understand who
[01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:21.400]  the real enemy is i completely disavow white nationalist supremacy or whatever this this
[01:34:21.400 --> 01:34:27.480]  this group marching is just like i disavow black lives matter marches that end up killing people
[01:34:27.480 --> 01:34:34.760]  it's the same crap it's the same it's the same labelism it's the same identity politics it's
[01:34:34.760 --> 01:34:45.960]  nonsense and it all is explained by what we've seen the response in the anti-american media
[01:34:45.960 --> 01:34:51.080]  look no further than cnn who's now endorsing antifa covering antifa notice that they've
[01:34:51.080 --> 01:34:58.600]  ignored antifa again this explains it all this is how you can see that this is clearly a setup
[01:34:58.600 --> 01:35:07.160]  people have been ignoring antifa sure they'll show you the violence at berkeley they'll report how
[01:35:07.160 --> 01:35:15.000]  mylo had to cancel his event but there it is cnn on august 15th 2017 what is antifa so cnn didn't
[01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:20.760]  want to tell you who antifa was when they burned down berkeley cnn didn't want to tell you who
[01:35:20.760 --> 01:35:26.680]  antifa was when they're punching people with bike locks cnn didn't want to tell you who antifa was
[01:35:26.680 --> 01:35:32.600]  when they were pointing guns at people cnn didn't want to tell you who antifa was when they disrupt
[01:35:32.600 --> 01:35:38.600]  trump rallies all across the nation show up with masks and hoods and hide their faces and beat people
[01:35:39.640 --> 01:35:43.720]  cnn didn't want to tell you who antifa was then they've been doing this for
[01:35:43.720 --> 01:35:47.720]  antifas been on the streets doing this for months now almost a year but cnn didn't want to tell you
[01:35:47.720 --> 01:35:58.520]  about antifa then now cnn is reporting who antifa is now yahoo news says as neo-nazis grow bolder
[01:35:58.520 --> 01:36:08.040]  the antifa has emerged to fight them and it's all in that headline right there everything you need
[01:36:08.040 --> 01:36:16.360]  to know about charlottesville is in that headline right there as neo-nazis grow bolder the antifa
[01:36:16.360 --> 01:36:23.320]  has emerged to fight them let's explain this neo-nazis grow bolder okay there's probably
[01:36:23.320 --> 01:36:29.480]  something to that you got a bunch of neo-nazis marching with torches yeah that's pretty bold
[01:36:29.480 --> 01:36:35.240]  that's pretty extreme so i think that there might be something to that but that's not the right
[01:36:35.240 --> 01:36:42.200]  that's not trump supporters that's fringe loons out there and just like the liberals get painted
[01:36:42.200 --> 01:36:47.640]  with the fringe lunatic liberals on the left i kind of understand why some liberals are sick
[01:36:47.640 --> 01:36:52.280]  of getting labeled that because now i know what it's like they label me are alt right then they
[01:36:52.280 --> 01:36:56.200]  say these neo-nazis are alt right no i disavow the alt right i have nothing to do with the alt
[01:36:56.200 --> 01:37:00.920]  right i've never wanted to be alt right i've never even wanted to be on the right that's just where
[01:37:00.920 --> 01:37:04.840]  you end up falling if you're rational and have common sense nowadays you just end up labeled
[01:37:04.840 --> 01:37:11.480]  as a conservative as on the right oh but then you find out that the unite the right rally
[01:37:11.480 --> 01:37:18.520]  is organized by a guy who has obama ties occupy wall street ties ties here ties there
[01:37:18.520 --> 01:37:24.520]  etc etc you have to question that it happens right after the neo-nazi march with torches
[01:37:24.520 --> 01:37:28.280]  i mean come on the antifa shows up and starts beating these people up
[01:37:30.120 --> 01:37:38.040]  so then this is where you get to the second part the antifa has emerged to fight them so now
[01:37:38.040 --> 01:37:45.240]  what they've done they've been building this narrative putting all of trump supporters
[01:37:45.240 --> 01:37:51.480]  into this class of people that they label the alt right that they've now shoved neo-nazis in
[01:37:52.040 --> 01:37:56.440]  fringe radicals in racist in all of these crazed people in and they just say they're
[01:37:56.440 --> 01:38:02.920]  alt right and that's what elected trump now they have antifa who's been going around the country
[01:38:02.920 --> 01:38:08.360]  bullying people burning things looting smashing cars lighting things on fire beating people with
[01:38:08.360 --> 01:38:15.480]  bike locks throwing things at police starting fights starting riots goes uncovered then they show
[01:38:15.480 --> 01:38:21.400]  up to fight these neo-nazis that they label alt right trump supporters now they cover antifa and
[01:38:21.400 --> 01:38:28.680]  they say they're here to fight them folks if you don't see how this whole thing has been staged
[01:38:28.680 --> 01:38:37.400]  has been planned from the beginning you're missing everything of course they want to bring down trump
[01:38:37.400 --> 01:38:44.120]  but it's not just trump it's the whole country it's all of it of course they have to bring down
[01:38:44.120 --> 01:38:49.080]  trump trump's pro america trump wants to make america great again you can't have a great america
[01:38:49.080 --> 01:38:54.760]  and take it down you have to have a divided america you have to have a weak america you have to have
[01:38:54.760 --> 01:39:00.120]  a poor america you have to have a mentally ill america you have to have a physically ill america
[01:39:00.120 --> 01:39:05.480]  that's how you take it down and they've got it all in place ready to go hillary clinton ready to
[01:39:05.480 --> 01:39:11.320]  bring down the hammer trump gets in america elect trump america comes back and so what do they have
[01:39:11.320 --> 01:39:17.080]  to do they have to bring up and tifa on one end they have to bring up the alt right on the other
[01:39:17.080 --> 01:39:24.040]  end get them stirred up get them stirred up then have a meat stir the pot have the police stand down
[01:39:24.040 --> 01:39:27.640]  funnel each protest group towards one another and then inside a civil war
[01:39:31.080 --> 01:39:36.760]  so that's what you got here folks and it's all funded by george soros the same guy that funds
[01:39:36.760 --> 01:39:45.560]  hillary clinton the same guy that funds obama the same people that meet with erin black robert fovell
[01:39:45.560 --> 01:39:52.200]  and bob kramer formally of the dnc released because they admitted they incite violence
[01:39:52.200 --> 01:39:54.120]  at trump rallies
[01:39:57.240 --> 01:40:06.360]  no it's not all staged though it's not all staged and this this guy who in my view is a total
[01:40:06.360 --> 01:40:17.720]  patsy the guy who ran over heather hayer is a total patsy now he's probably a nazi crazy
[01:40:17.720 --> 01:40:25.080]  right-wing lunatic yes absolutely not disagreeing with that but have you been noticing how the
[01:40:25.080 --> 01:40:29.320]  narrative has been building on this guy all of a sudden you've got these teachers coming out from
[01:40:29.320 --> 01:40:34.360]  when he was in grade school saying i knew he was a nazi when he was 12 he was a white supremacist
[01:40:34.360 --> 01:40:42.280]  when he was 12 he's been on anti-psychotic since he was 12 boy if that isn't the script for a
[01:40:42.280 --> 01:40:49.400]  patsy if that isn't the cut out for a patsy i don't know what is and then apparently he drives
[01:40:49.400 --> 01:40:56.280]  his car down the road a bunch of antifa members smash up his car then he plows it into a crowd
[01:40:56.280 --> 01:41:01.240]  of people and then speeds away and by the way i mean i gotta give the guy credit for being an
[01:41:01.240 --> 01:41:08.760]  absolute right-wing lunatic nazi freak out he had some pretty amazing driving skills didn't he
[01:41:08.760 --> 01:41:16.360]  amazing how this this crazed right-winger this lunatic fringe right-wing racist neo-nazi
[01:41:18.360 --> 01:41:25.400]  magically drives like a professional driver just floors it goes back like 60 miles per hour perfectly
[01:41:25.400 --> 01:41:30.680]  and then he's out of the scene in no time and then magically somehow the cops haven't pulled over as
[01:41:30.680 --> 01:41:35.160]  well oh and also the only police chopper that would have been able to actually see the entire thing
[01:41:35.160 --> 01:41:43.400]  from a bird's-eye view yeah yep that goes down and two officers die we're being set up folks
[01:41:45.800 --> 01:41:55.400]  and it honestly it pains me it hurts me it really hurts me that so much hatred has been
[01:41:55.400 --> 01:42:06.440]  has been cooked up against president trump that i actually believe just like members of antifa
[01:42:07.400 --> 01:42:12.200]  just like members in the mainstream media on msnbc and cnn and all these other people
[01:42:12.200 --> 01:42:17.720]  just like you're seeing how desperate they are how desperate the establishment is you're seeing
[01:42:17.720 --> 01:42:24.520]  the desperation folks you don't think that same desperation would exist in a virginia democrat
[01:42:24.520 --> 01:42:29.720]  governor that doesn't like trump a virginia mayor that doesn't like trump a virginia police force
[01:42:29.720 --> 01:42:35.560]  that doesn't like trump you don't think that they would have that same desperation you don't think
[01:42:36.120 --> 01:42:40.920]  that they would be justifying their actions against this country just like this entire
[01:42:40.920 --> 01:42:49.240]  stack of news i have right here of people who fake hate crimes to try to demonize conservatives
[01:42:49.240 --> 01:42:53.560]  to try to demonize white people because that's who they think is the enemy that's who they've been
[01:42:53.560 --> 01:42:58.440]  taught as the enemy so they think if they stage an attack blame that enemy they're victorious
[01:42:59.720 --> 01:43:03.160]  if you don't think that same exact thing would happen in police forces
[01:43:03.160 --> 01:43:08.040]  happen in governor's offices happen in mayor's offices happen at the top of the democrat party
[01:43:08.680 --> 01:43:14.440]  you are sleeping at the wheel because we have all of the evidence and it's been going on for years
[01:43:16.520 --> 01:43:20.200]  speaking of going on for years let's go to this video because it's really amazing to me
[01:43:20.200 --> 01:43:25.000]  you had Nancy Pelosi you had all these democrat leaders you had all of these mainstream media
[01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:31.960]  organizations trump comes out literally like within an hour after these these crazed attacks
[01:43:31.960 --> 01:43:38.840]  disavows the attacks disavows all racism tweets it out has a press conference unprecedented
[01:43:39.720 --> 01:43:45.560]  unprecedented that he would do this compared to obama who completely ignored black lives matter
[01:43:45.560 --> 01:43:50.760]  protested killed police officers completely ignored domestic violence and domestic terrorism
[01:43:50.760 --> 01:43:56.840]  trump makes a statement unprecedented where obama does nothing and then even after he
[01:43:56.840 --> 01:44:02.600]  makes the statement even after he disavows it something obama never did he still gets called
[01:44:02.600 --> 01:44:06.840]  out by democrats on twitter saying why aren't you disavowed he still gets called out by people on
[01:44:06.840 --> 01:44:11.960]  mainstream television saying why am i you disavowed even though he already did so mark dice went ahead
[01:44:11.960 --> 01:44:19.000]  and put over a compilation of donald trump who has never disavowed racism in his life so here's
[01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:26.200]  four minutes of a compilation of donald trump never disavowing racism um he never said to white
[01:44:26.200 --> 01:44:30.520]  nationalists explicitly and if he did i can't remember off the top of my head but i don't think
[01:44:30.520 --> 01:44:35.800]  he did uh say he never said i don't want your support don't vote for me i don't think he did
[01:44:35.800 --> 01:44:42.440]  i was there every day how do you feel about the recent endorsement from david duke i didn't even
[01:44:42.440 --> 01:44:48.840]  know he endorsed me david duke endorsed me okay all right i disavow okay i totally disavow the
[01:44:48.840 --> 01:44:55.000]  klu Klux Klan i totally disavow david duke i've been doing it now for two weeks this is you're
[01:44:55.000 --> 01:45:01.320]  probably about the 18th person that's asked me the question right david duke is a bad person who
[01:45:01.320 --> 01:45:10.760]  i disavowed on numerous occasions over the years what he didn't do is say that that he was not going
[01:45:10.760 --> 01:45:17.480]  to accept the support of any of these fringe groups i've reject david duke rejected david duke
[01:45:18.200 --> 01:45:25.800]  i've rejected the kkk the klu Klux Klan from the time i'm five years old i rejected them donald trump
[01:45:25.800 --> 01:45:31.720]  refusing to condemn former klu Klux Klan's plan was david duke what do you see as the biggest problem
[01:45:31.720 --> 01:45:38.200]  with the reform party 17 years ago well you've got david duke just joined a bigot a racist a problem
[01:45:38.200 --> 01:45:43.960]  i mean this is not exactly the people you that's from 17 years ago he said on friday i disavow
[01:45:43.960 --> 01:45:49.960]  why ask him again on saturday why not disavow david duke disavow yeah trump's such a racist he has
[01:45:49.960 --> 01:45:54.200]  all these african-americans that are willing to stick up for him continue to disavow people
[01:45:54.200 --> 01:45:59.880]  and the question was asked about david duke david duke and various groups when i put out that i
[01:45:59.880 --> 01:46:05.000]  reject kkk and david duke nobody picks it up you know why they don't because they don't want to pick
[01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:11.320]  it up so trump's a racist but at the same time liberals and democrats are mad at him for hiring
[01:46:11.320 --> 01:46:16.440]  people from other countries it's such a joke twitter and facebook they would disavow again
[01:46:16.440 --> 01:46:21.240]  i disavow them every time i speak to somebody virtually and you know they just keep it going
[01:46:21.240 --> 01:46:26.520]  they keep disavowing i don't like any group of hate no hate groups why are you so hateful
[01:46:27.160 --> 01:46:32.760]  but i've said this before the press hates me to say it they just don't want to pick it up so are
[01:46:32.760 --> 01:46:37.400]  you prepared right now to make a clear and unequivocal statement renouncing the support of all white
[01:46:37.400 --> 01:46:44.840]  supremacists of course i am some of your supporters in chicago were acting violently as well and i
[01:46:44.840 --> 01:46:52.120]  have to say the guy who rushed the stage yesterday at donald trump voted for you myself i know it's
[01:46:54.600 --> 01:46:59.000]  oh yeah and then you had the other person that rushed the trump stage austin christ
[01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:04.200]  who showed up in the wiki leaks democrat emails to take responsibility for everybody who voted for
[01:47:04.200 --> 01:47:10.600]  me it will be a very difficult life we're closely following the terrible events unfolding in charlotte
[01:47:10.600 --> 01:47:17.880]  still virginia here he is not not in them in the strongest possible terms nope this egregious
[01:47:17.880 --> 01:47:24.760]  display of hatred bigotry and violence on many sides why won't you condemn many sides it's been
[01:47:24.760 --> 01:47:29.080]  going on for a long time in our country here's president trump not condemning not donald trump
[01:47:29.080 --> 01:47:37.960]  not barack obama it's been going on for a long long time it is no place in america what is vital
[01:47:37.960 --> 01:47:44.600]  now is i love how every problem that obama had was bush's fault you know obama inherited all
[01:47:44.600 --> 01:47:49.080]  bush's problems trump gets in it's all his fault nothing was obama's fault it wasn't obama that
[01:47:49.080 --> 01:47:55.480]  divided the nation it's all trumps fault in our society and no child should ever be afraid to go
[01:47:55.480 --> 01:48:04.840]  outside and play or be with their parents and have a good time no child trust anybody needs
[01:48:04.840 --> 01:48:09.160]  from telepon you didn't plan identity he just said child he had to read pretty carefully these
[01:48:09.160 --> 01:48:14.360]  scripted words and that this was not something that he could speak extemporaneously about that
[01:48:14.360 --> 01:48:20.120]  he could speak to look at katie turd we had meaningful dialogue with mr donald trump and uh
[01:48:20.120 --> 01:48:24.840]  we voiced concerns that were sensitive to the african-american community we asked questions
[01:48:24.840 --> 01:48:29.240]  and the questions were answered where we're all satisfied with the answers and we're unified front
[01:48:29.240 --> 01:48:37.240]  right here mainstream media is such scum such scum you could be doing an interview with katie
[01:48:37.240 --> 01:48:41.640]  turd and she could say do you disavow white racism i would say yes i completely disavow
[01:48:41.640 --> 01:48:45.240]  white racism and then the follow-up question would be well why haven't you disavowed white
[01:48:45.240 --> 01:48:52.760]  racism i mean that's literally these these people so now you have a former nypd officer
[01:48:53.400 --> 01:48:58.680]  on tucker carlson saying free speech is meaningless if people think free speech means you get to
[01:48:58.680 --> 01:49:04.120]  punch them in the face and when i find so striking about what happened in charlotte's there's really
[01:49:04.120 --> 01:49:08.520]  no debate about it this is not something that the right is saying or the left is saying they're both
[01:49:08.520 --> 01:49:14.600]  saying the aclu is saying it the marchers the confederate flags are saying it the police stood
[01:49:14.600 --> 01:49:19.880]  by and allowed violence to accelerate why would they know the aclu was okay with the white supremacist
[01:49:19.880 --> 01:49:24.760]  yes hucker it's perplexing and i think the reason you're seeing this kind of ideological unity on
[01:49:24.760 --> 01:49:30.040]  both sides of the aisle is because let's be honest free speech is meaningless if some people take free
[01:49:30.040 --> 01:49:35.000]  speech to mean i'm free to punch you in the face as you're speaking that's not free speech okay that's
[01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:41.320]  just straight up hardcore criminality and violence why is this phenomenon of the stephanie ralings
[01:49:41.320 --> 01:49:47.320]  blake the mayor of baltimore or give them space to destroy phenomenon happening i have no good
[01:49:47.320 --> 01:49:54.680]  answer other than let them vent theory is it one of these socio psycho babel theories that if you
[01:49:54.680 --> 01:49:59.240]  let people go out there and they're going to just get tired of breaking stuff or punching people
[01:49:59.240 --> 01:50:05.160]  after a while i have no good explanation because there isn't one this is pure unadulterated idiocy
[01:50:05.160 --> 01:50:09.720]  and one thing on this talker to be clear about this this is not the rank and file cops i think you
[01:50:09.720 --> 01:50:15.080]  and i both know that the cops know exactly how to do their job this is politicians and police
[01:50:15.080 --> 01:50:20.360]  managers behold into politicians who have made these awful decisions to let them vent or quote
[01:50:20.360 --> 01:50:26.040]  give them space to destroy as was said in baltimore but am i wrong to to question
[01:50:27.480 --> 01:50:31.160]  to question the political leanings and ideologies of some of these police officers
[01:50:32.360 --> 01:50:37.640]  are police officers above propaganda and brainwashing you're telling me that some police
[01:50:37.640 --> 01:50:43.400]  officer that hates donald trump that has fallen victim to the brainwashing wouldn't want to allow
[01:50:43.400 --> 01:50:50.200]  something this to happen to demonize president trump i don't know that's probably a thought crime
[01:50:50.200 --> 01:50:57.400]  that's probably a thought crime we'll be right back it's been said any society is only three
[01:50:57.400 --> 01:51:03.240]  missed meals away from chaos those times may be near think about it our country faces multiple
[01:51:03.240 --> 01:51:08.360]  terrorist threats and aggressions from russia and north korea social unrest and violent marches yet
[01:51:08.360 --> 01:51:13.000]  again may lead to looting of stores and city shutdowns and a crumbling infrastructure leaves
[01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:18.120]  our power grid vulnerable to long-term outages from a single cyber attack when the chaos from

[01:58:06.440 --> 01:58:12.760]  and Tifa would show up and firebomb me with fecus balloons the mainstream media and Bernie
[01:58:12.760 --> 01:58:18.440]  Sanders would tell you I'm a Nazi and it's fine I don't want to divide on race the whole

[02:01:05.160 --> 02:01:10.280]  racist they've been told that america is this is that warmongers pigs everything some of it might
[02:01:10.280 --> 02:01:16.280]  be true some of it might be true in our history and america's not perfect we got a long way to go i hope
[02:01:18.120 --> 02:01:26.520]  but the big lie the big deception the big ruse is that they got these people to think
[02:01:26.520 --> 02:01:32.200]  that there's somewhere else better or they got these people to think that they can make it better
[02:01:32.200 --> 02:01:38.600]  give them more control take away the control take away self-government take away independence give it

[02:08:29.080 --> 02:08:35.000]  you were in charlotte'sville and you had a first hand perspective of the violence that's there you
[02:08:35.000 --> 02:08:39.560]  said you wanted to start there thank you for joining us today raheem pleasure is all mine thank
[02:08:39.560 --> 02:08:44.440]  you for having me so tell me yeah go ahead what did you experience in charlotte'sville well you
[02:08:44.440 --> 02:08:49.480]  know we got scrambled there after all the violence uh stopped but we did see a lot of the aftermath
[02:08:50.200 --> 02:08:57.160]  which included um antifa and violent leftists walking around the streets with bats um with
[02:08:57.160 --> 02:09:03.400]  with two by fours um you know presumably attached to placards maybe once upon a time but they weren't
[02:09:03.400 --> 02:09:09.880]  at that point um we heard horror stories i i spoke to a guy on the street who told me uh that he was
[02:09:09.880 --> 02:09:15.480]  told by somebody that was the wrong day to be wiped in charlotte'sville and then plays into what you
[02:09:15.480 --> 02:09:21.000]  were saying about lord before the break um doesn't matter by the way if you're wearing a trump hat or
[02:09:21.000 --> 02:09:27.720]  not lord uh he's basically inciting violence against all white people yeah that's true yeah um and so
[02:09:27.720 --> 02:09:32.520]  you know this this is what was going on uh in the aftermath in charlotte'sville incredibly sad
[02:09:32.520 --> 02:09:38.680]  seemed actually to see a town like that which is obviously very useful and and and historic uh have
[02:09:38.680 --> 02:09:44.360]  to have thousands of police you know a very heavily militarized police um deployed onto the streets and
[02:09:44.360 --> 02:09:49.320]  of course governor terry mccaller whisked into the building he's a big gun control advocate but he
[02:09:49.320 --> 02:09:56.680]  didn't mind being whisked in by lots of men with guns um one for them uh another for us um and you
[02:09:56.680 --> 02:10:00.840]  know he gave his press conference afterwards and i was sitting in the front row and it was a it was
[02:10:00.840 --> 02:10:07.240]  a litany of hatred against conservatives now of course um i i think that there's no justification
[02:10:07.240 --> 02:10:14.040]  for for the uh the murder uh on the uh on the saturday there and uh and of course i you know i
[02:10:14.040 --> 02:10:18.760]  don't have much truck with uh any truck with with the groups carrying teaking torches and they're
[02:10:18.760 --> 02:10:23.480]  doing all that sort of but at the same time i asked terry mccall if five times if he would
[02:10:23.480 --> 02:10:28.440]  condemn antifa as well and the violent leftist and i didn't even ask him to condemn them in
[02:10:28.440 --> 02:10:32.760]  equal terms i just in equal measure i just asked him to condemn them and i basically
[02:10:32.760 --> 02:10:40.280]  shout this question at him five times no answer whatsoever raheem kasam his new book is no go
[02:10:40.280 --> 02:10:44.200]  zones how shreya law is coming to a neighborhood near you he's also the editor and chief of bright
[02:10:44.200 --> 02:10:49.160]  bark but we're discussing what happened in charlesville he was there for that you know raheem
[02:10:49.160 --> 02:10:54.360]  there's this there's this rush to judgment on these things and you have to be very careful with this
[02:10:54.360 --> 02:10:58.680]  stuff there's this rush to judgment to immediately demonize this group immediately demonize that
[02:10:58.680 --> 02:11:04.120]  group uh where i've learned in my young time doing this here working for info info wars
[02:11:04.120 --> 02:11:10.120]  and alex jones to sometimes wait be patient gather all the intel gather all the evidence
[02:11:10.120 --> 02:11:16.920]  and then take your stance and i'm i'm ready to take the stance again i i didn't want to rush
[02:11:16.920 --> 02:11:21.400]  to judgment and just say oh antifa is responsible for everything oh they didn't do anything wrong
[02:11:21.400 --> 02:11:28.760]  with the white nationalist but i did the further research backed by what you just said it is clear
[02:11:28.760 --> 02:11:34.120]  to me that it was antifa out there inciting violence it was antifa that was out there being
[02:11:34.120 --> 02:11:40.760]  violent beating people bringing weapons hitting cars and now people are going to say oh oh look
[02:11:40.760 --> 02:11:45.480]  he's standing up for the white supremacist he's he's he's with the alt right no i'm just pointing
[02:11:45.480 --> 02:11:51.240]  out the facts and that's what you saw on the street absolutely you know we we live in the
[02:11:51.240 --> 02:11:56.120]  bizarro world at the moment where apparently if you point out the fact it means you're taking
[02:11:56.120 --> 02:12:01.880]  a position that you're not taking i mean nobody's i don't think anybody is siding with the person
[02:12:01.880 --> 02:12:06.760]  that decided to run people over i don't think anybody is siding um and i've not heard anybody
[02:12:06.760 --> 02:12:11.160]  by the way siding from a from a conservative perspective from a libertarian perspective
[02:12:11.160 --> 02:12:15.480]  siding with the guys who were who were you know had they had their tiki torches out and acting
[02:12:15.480 --> 02:12:19.720]  like morons in charlotte's bill but you know what you have first amendment in this country if they
[02:12:19.720 --> 02:12:25.480]  want to do that that's their right uh what isn't right um is that the police especially and i have
[02:12:25.480 --> 02:12:31.080]  a suspicion that the order came uh from afar i think it was maybe a political order but the
[02:12:31.080 --> 02:12:36.680]  police didn't effectively keep those groups apart we've seen it in europe a lot by the way when when
[02:12:36.680 --> 02:12:42.360]  two groups like that whether it's antifa versus uh hard right organizations or whether they're just
[02:12:42.360 --> 02:12:47.720]  patriotic groups that are marching or antiterrorist groups that are marching uh antifa goes in with
[02:12:47.720 --> 02:12:54.280]  the express uh um you know will to try and force the advantage in destruction and the police put
[02:12:54.280 --> 02:12:59.720]  these groups next to each other what do they think is going to happen yeah that's a great point there's
[02:12:59.720 --> 02:13:06.120]  a premeditated thought that they want to go out there hit a trump supporter hit a car with a bat
[02:13:06.120 --> 02:13:13.960]  be violent they have a history of that now i'm curious though how close i'm sorry they've done it to
[02:13:13.960 --> 02:13:18.760]  me i've been hit with a ladder in the face uh you know i've been hit with placards they try and get a
[02:13:18.760 --> 02:13:22.840]  rise out of you they know they can you know if they pick you they try and trip you up they know
[02:13:22.840 --> 02:13:27.800]  somebody like me especially might turn around and socket to them um and by and at that point that's
[02:13:27.800 --> 02:13:32.120]  when the camera start flashing you know they know exactly what they're doing yeah that's true and they
[02:13:32.120 --> 02:13:36.920]  usually will try to run at that point as well they'll scamper away like a cockroach to light
[02:13:36.920 --> 02:13:42.360]  how close were you to the car accident that was fatal for heather hayer
[02:13:43.400 --> 02:13:48.200]  well we actually got there a couple of hours afterwards okay i was you know we saw the street
[02:13:48.200 --> 02:13:53.480]  where the street was on lockdown uh when we were there you know of course uh as i said incredibly
[02:13:53.480 --> 02:13:59.080]  sad to see a city in america uh transfigured into this really what we're talking about here by the
[02:13:59.080 --> 02:14:04.920]  way is two groups and i think we can say with some certainty fringe groups that the media is trying to
[02:14:04.920 --> 02:14:10.280]  play up um and on the antifa side they're writing hagiographical pieces about them i don't know if
[02:14:10.280 --> 02:14:16.200]  you saw this disgusting yahoo news piece yesterday uh uh lauding praise upon heaping praise upon
[02:14:16.200 --> 02:14:22.040]  antifa and on the other side cnn trying to play up uh these other groups are these these what they
[02:14:22.040 --> 02:14:26.520]  call hard right groups i'm not sure they have any level of conservatism within them they're
[02:14:26.520 --> 02:14:31.160]  nationalist they're national socialists far as i'm concerned but you know let's have some historical
[02:14:31.160 --> 02:14:35.000]  perspective here these are two groups who are basically trying to re-litigate the spanish civil
[02:14:35.000 --> 02:14:40.840]  war you know these these two groups find their their um their background in in the 1930s and i'm
[02:14:40.840 --> 02:14:45.720]  not talking about uh uh germany and we're not playing good you know godwin's law here we're
[02:14:45.720 --> 02:14:50.280]  talking about the spanish civil war uh where you have the communist group the trozkyist group and
[02:14:50.280 --> 02:14:54.920]  that's where antifa was founded don't forget it was originally supposed to be a trozkyist combat
[02:14:54.920 --> 02:14:58.680]  squad and on the other side you have you know people who who are quite happy to wear the
[02:14:58.680 --> 02:15:03.800]  bashers label um that's what we're seeing it would be nice if somebody i'm gonna point my tv up here
[02:15:03.800 --> 02:15:09.960]  it'll be nice if somebody had an intellectual analysis to bring on to cnn or even quite frankly
[02:15:09.960 --> 02:15:14.680]  onto fox news but they don't we just live in this in this vacuous orwellian environment
[02:15:14.680 --> 02:15:19.240]  where everything is new and there are no there is no history and we can't learn anything and we have
[02:15:19.240 --> 02:15:25.080]  to treat everything like it's uh like it's some sort of new phenomenon it's not i think that outside
[02:15:25.080 --> 02:15:29.560]  of lou dobbs and sean hannity you're completely correct i think tucker callison goes down there
[02:15:29.560 --> 02:15:34.120]  but he doesn't get as analytical he just kind of exposes it with his interviews but you know it's
[02:15:34.120 --> 02:15:38.120]  amazing to me you've dealt with antifa i don't know how much you've dealt with him i have to deal
[02:15:38.120 --> 02:15:41.960]  with him all the time when i get sent out to rallies or sent out to do interviews with people
[02:15:41.960 --> 02:15:49.880]  or sent out to events this is the weirdest thing to me 95 percent of antifa is white 95 percent
[02:15:49.880 --> 02:15:55.560]  of antifa are white people and then maybe four percent are latino and then maybe and i don't
[02:15:55.560 --> 02:16:00.200]  even know if i've ever seen a black antifa member to be honest i don't even see any black people in
[02:16:00.200 --> 02:16:09.000]  antifa and then i see that black people are standing up for um confederate monuments now black
[02:16:09.000 --> 02:16:13.240]  groups are standing up for confederate monuments saying you're not going to erase american history
[02:16:13.960 --> 02:16:17.960]  but meanwhile they sit here and they act like antifa is fighting the racist
[02:16:17.960 --> 02:16:23.560]  even though they're all white racists against whites and they have the audacity by the way
[02:16:23.560 --> 02:16:30.200]  my name is raheem kasam and look at me they have the audacity to call me a racist to call me a bigot
[02:16:30.200 --> 02:16:35.640]  to call me a xenophobe um because i have conservative views i mean it's it's absolutely
[02:16:35.640 --> 02:16:40.200]  outrageous uh what these people are getting away with and and there's a reason by the way that you
[02:16:40.200 --> 02:16:46.600]  don't see uh antifa versus conservative debates happening on television uh why jack kappa doesn't
[02:16:46.600 --> 02:16:51.400]  want to organize these debates because he knows that some of you like me would write a white
[02:16:51.400 --> 02:16:56.920]  the flaw with them uh you know from a rhetorical and intellectual perspective somebody like yourself
[02:16:56.920 --> 02:17:01.640]  probably most of your audience as well quite frankly they don't have an intellectual leg to
[02:17:01.640 --> 02:17:08.840]  stand on and when you look at what they stand for um rather than what they stand again uh it appears
[02:17:08.840 --> 02:17:15.400]  to be the complete and utter destruction of what it is america has offered the world and and what
[02:17:15.400 --> 02:17:22.520]  uh preceded america as well quite frankly um my country the united kingdom and you know this is
[02:17:22.520 --> 02:17:27.400]  where we this is where we can draw two things together uh you're seeing statues being pulled
[02:17:27.400 --> 02:17:32.840]  down they of course they're not pulling down the lenin statue uh in in the fremont neighborhood
[02:17:32.840 --> 02:17:38.920]  of seattle they're only pulling down uh you know the the confederate statues um lenin of course
[02:17:38.920 --> 02:17:43.400]  being responsible for the deaths of tens of millions of people but let's forget about that right um
[02:17:43.400 --> 02:17:48.040]  and on the other side of it you look at mass migration you look at open borders all of these
[02:17:48.040 --> 02:17:55.400]  things that they try and further and pursue and the funders who help them do this uh it takes us
[02:17:55.400 --> 02:18:01.160]  into another area and it's the area of my book that you mentioned at the top of the uh interview
[02:18:01.160 --> 02:18:05.800]  which is no go zones uh this is something else that they defend uh because it leads to the
[02:18:05.800 --> 02:18:11.080]  destruction of western civilization at least the destruction of the united kingdom of france or the
[02:18:11.080 --> 02:18:17.320]  netherlands of belgium and indeed of the united states too if you're not careful um and i i studied
[02:18:17.320 --> 02:18:22.120]  this for some time and we've got the book out now and the book actually goes into some detail about
[02:18:22.120 --> 02:18:26.360]  the radical necklace groups who that funders are as well and how these two issues marry off
[02:18:26.920 --> 02:18:31.720]  yeah i know that that was what you said uh before we came on how you can actually tie in the two
[02:18:31.720 --> 02:18:38.040]  issues with what's going on in america and really it's because they've aligned themselves with with
[02:18:38.040 --> 02:18:46.840]  radical elements of what i just view as a 19th century uh practice of a religion sharia law i
[02:18:46.840 --> 02:18:51.240]  mean that's what it is to me this is old times nobody treats women like this anymore nobody has
[02:18:51.240 --> 02:18:56.440]  ideals like this anymore and also when you talk about how antifa can't hold their uh stance in
[02:18:56.440 --> 02:19:02.440]  a debate yeah it really goes to show how empty they are intellectually how completely empty
[02:19:02.440 --> 02:19:05.720]  they are uh real quick we're about to go to a break we're going to bring you back up on the other
[02:19:05.720 --> 02:19:10.920]  side but talk about the relation of your book and what we're seeing with antifa on the streets
[02:19:12.600 --> 02:19:17.160]  well it's you know it's it's simple and it's complicated at the same time so i'll be as brief
[02:19:17.160 --> 02:19:22.120]  as possible you know uh these guys they want to they want to destroy you know western civilization
[02:19:22.120 --> 02:19:27.080]  as we know it like i said this is a continuation of the of the toshiest marriages from the 1930s
[02:19:27.080 --> 02:19:32.920]  anybody who's ever uh read a book uh a back you know read a history book and believe me these guys
[02:19:32.920 --> 02:19:38.680]  haven't uh but our side does uh so there it is we'll be right back we'll be right back with haim
[02:19:38.680 --> 02:19:44.280]  kasan here's the book they want to take down america folks that's why the left is allying

[02:24:41.640 --> 02:24:46.280]  in the book it's it's got the evidence it's got the proof but you know as someone in america i see
[02:24:46.280 --> 02:24:51.720]  here and i say how can this come to the streets of america a no goes on in america not in my country
[02:24:51.720 --> 02:24:57.000]  what say you well what are you going to do about it i don't know i guess i'm going to have you on
[02:24:57.000 --> 02:25:03.000]  to explain it to me the reason i'm so so flipping in an answer like that is that you know i've heard
[02:25:03.000 --> 02:25:06.280]  that for so long now because i've been writing the book and we've been doing a lot of publicity
[02:25:06.280 --> 02:25:11.320]  surrounding it and people say to me oh you know that can't happen here we've got our guns and we've
[02:25:11.320 --> 02:25:16.760]  you know we're strong people and we don't and that's all true uh but unless you're going to
[02:25:16.760 --> 02:25:21.480]  you know uh march a militia through the streets of ham tramuk in michigan which i suspect probably
[02:25:21.480 --> 02:25:26.760]  isn't the most constructive thing you could do uh well you know not not at this point anyway i mean
[02:25:26.760 --> 02:25:31.480]  you know i don't i don't suspect that we'll ever get there at least i hope you don't um you know
[02:25:31.480 --> 02:25:36.440]  what are you going to do about it because it's it's not going to happen in an area that is
[02:25:36.440 --> 02:25:41.480]  pretty naturally disposed to having uh conservatives who own guns in it it's going to happen in
[02:25:41.480 --> 02:25:46.280]  areas like ham tramuk in michigan it's happening in dearborn in michigan it's happening um in
[02:25:46.280 --> 02:25:51.800]  minnesota it's happening in some places uh in new york uh state as well uh you know these are
[02:25:52.760 --> 02:25:58.600]  more than uh more more likely than not areas that elect democrats and it's the democrats um
[02:25:58.600 --> 02:26:03.240]  that impose these policies that allow these things to happen those policies are very well
[02:26:03.240 --> 02:26:08.680]  fairest policies they are sanctuary city type policies um you know in ham tramuk i mean it's
[02:26:08.680 --> 02:26:14.840]  a majority uh muslim city council now it's a 2.1 square mile city and it has an upper estimate
[02:26:14.840 --> 02:26:20.120]  of 17 mosques in this place the lower estimate being 12 that's still a mosque every third or
[02:26:20.120 --> 02:26:24.920]  fourth street corner depending on which way you look at it uh they play the islamic called the
[02:26:24.920 --> 02:26:30.040]  prayer out on the streets in ham tramuk um and the uh and you know the locals just have to deal
[02:26:30.040 --> 02:26:34.680]  with it now that's the way it is even the new york times even the fake news new york times
[02:26:34.680 --> 02:26:40.040]  reported on this in 2004 i'm not sure they report on it anymore uh they seem to have changed their
[02:26:40.040 --> 02:26:44.920]  um changed their priorities um but but this is this is you know documented it's here in the
[02:26:44.920 --> 02:26:49.880]  united states the niqab the burqa um all those sorts of things are already here we know there are
[02:26:49.880 --> 02:26:53.960]  terror cells here there are private islamic compound new york state and south carolina
[02:26:53.960 --> 02:26:58.920]  so when i hear oh no it can't happen america firstly i'm saying well you know it already is here
[02:26:58.920 --> 02:27:02.760]  and secondly well what are you going to do about it yeah and i was just playing devil's advocate
[02:27:02.760 --> 02:27:10.040]  there and the truth is though but but the truth is you hit it on the head see it's not that they're
[02:27:10.040 --> 02:27:16.360]  just going to be able to walk into your community and set up camp no they have to have the government
[02:27:16.360 --> 02:27:21.160]  get behind it and they have to use liberal politicians pushing virtue signaling ideas
[02:27:21.160 --> 02:27:25.560]  saying be politically correct be tolerant all these people have been hated by so much we have
[02:27:25.560 --> 02:27:29.480]  to embrace them we have to let them in and then it just gets out of control and like you said it
[02:27:29.480 --> 02:27:33.480]  ends up with the situations like we've seen in europe where there's no go zones you literally
[02:27:33.480 --> 02:27:39.960]  can't walk across the street if you're a white man or you will probably um get beaten but it's amazing
[02:27:39.960 --> 02:27:46.680]  to me that people wouldn't understand this even though they can see it because the answer to me
[02:27:46.680 --> 02:27:50.440]  is obvious you can come to this country you can immigrate you can have whatever religion you want
[02:27:50.440 --> 02:27:56.280]  you have to assimilate you have to like american culture i'm sorry if you don't like
[02:27:56.280 --> 02:28:00.200]  go into a football game and a bunch of people drinking beer and cheer in and hooting and
[02:28:00.200 --> 02:28:05.000]  hollering and a bunch of cheerleaders in bikinis then i'm sorry you're probably not going to fit
[02:28:05.000 --> 02:28:10.840]  in here well cheers to that and i just to tie these two things together again i predict the next
[02:28:10.840 --> 02:28:15.880]  monument these the left is going to go after is mountain rushmore not because of the slave owning
[02:28:15.880 --> 02:28:21.000]  washington and jefferson stuff but because teddy roosevelt is on that memorial and he once said
[02:28:21.000 --> 02:28:26.600]  that the immigrant should recognize we have one country one flag one language and if you can't
[02:28:26.600 --> 02:28:31.480]  integrate you can't assimilate then you have to go back that man is on that rushmore and prepare
[02:28:31.480 --> 02:28:36.920]  for there to be an onslaught about that yeah i mean how dare we have a country that brings anyone in
[02:28:36.920 --> 02:28:42.200]  has a process and then ask them to appreciate our country and like us because we invited them into
[02:28:42.200 --> 02:28:46.120]  our house i mean i don't know about you raheem but when i have guests into my house i say yeah
[02:28:46.120 --> 02:28:51.480]  just trash the place just just trash the place just do what you want take over my bedroom and
[02:28:51.480 --> 02:28:56.600]  and you can and you can perform your female genital mutilation yeah yeah put yeah female
[02:28:56.600 --> 02:29:01.880]  generally mutilate my daughter and put a hood over my wife yeah please right right this is this is
[02:29:01.880 --> 02:29:05.480]  something that we you know we're just not getting at the moment and i was surprised to find out when

[02:29:10.040 --> 02:29:13.960]  first of its kind yeah that's what nigel's that's what nigel said in his foreword he was shocked at

[02:32:05.720 --> 02:32:11.560]  ancestors in many cases had much better nutrition than we do today and our ancient ancestors
[02:32:11.560 --> 02:32:16.920]  sought out the bones of the animals that they were hunting killing and then processing and so

[02:35:42.520 --> 02:35:48.200]  with rape and facebook host framed conservatives growing list of post-election hate crimes turn
[02:35:48.200 --> 02:35:53.400]  out to be hoaxes 2016 year of the hoax hate crime yet another hate crime these are just
[02:35:53.400 --> 02:35:59.000]  headlines i'm just reading here long island man charged in nassau community swastika case
[02:35:59.000 --> 02:36:04.040]  another fake hate crime jihadi terror manuals on how to use a car as tool of war for mass
[02:36:04.040 --> 02:36:07.880]  murder can be found in just two minutes on google and twitter but yet they blocked trump
[02:36:07.880 --> 02:36:14.360]  supporters fake hate crimes here fake hate crimes there us israeli teen arrested as jewish center
[02:36:14.360 --> 02:36:21.000]  bomber racist liberal reporter arrested in connection with eight jewish community center bomb threats
[02:36:21.000 --> 02:36:27.560]  blames nasty racist white girl another fake hate crime report trump says wave of anti-semitic crimes
[02:36:27.560 --> 02:36:34.040]  sometimes it's the reverse oh and then he ends up being right and in the times of israel they
[02:36:34.040 --> 02:36:42.600]  publish this is trump owed an apology after the jcc bomb threat arrest and he was completely
[02:36:42.600 --> 02:36:46.920]  correct even though they tried to demonize him for saying it was the reverse even though you
[02:36:46.920 --> 02:36:53.960]  have a stack of news that it would take the average antifa members 16 years just to finish
[02:36:53.960 --> 02:36:57.400]  reading all these stories it's so tough for them to read that's probably why they don't know what's
[02:36:57.400 --> 02:37:01.400]  going on yeah trump's owed an apology for a lot of things how about all the things they said about
[02:37:01.400 --> 02:37:04.440]  his wife how about all the things they said about his kids how about all the things they said about
[02:37:04.440 --> 02:37:10.840]  him we're all owed an apology from the fake news media it's ridiculous what they get away with
[02:37:11.960 --> 02:37:15.400]  so dick it's just ridiculous what hillary clinton gets away with but here's an interesting
[02:37:15.400 --> 02:37:21.000]  development you know the doj has said they're going to investigate what happened at charlottesville
[02:37:21.000 --> 02:37:25.000]  i got to be honest i still have no faith in this deal i don't think we're ever going to know the
[02:37:25.000 --> 02:37:28.920]  the absolute truth i don't think the police officers are going to cooperate i don't think the
[02:37:28.920 --> 02:37:34.040]  politicians are going to cooperate uh so i don't expect really anything to be done about this i
[02:37:34.040 --> 02:37:39.560]  don't expect all the members of antifa that hit the car prior to it running over heather hayer i
[02:37:39.560 --> 02:37:42.840]  don't i don't believe that they'll be held to justice even though they should be held accountable
[02:37:42.840 --> 02:37:47.320]  so i'm not really sure if anything is going to happen here but justice department demands
[02:37:47.320 --> 02:37:55.080]  1.3 million ip addresses related to trump resistance site so this is an overall thing
[02:37:55.080 --> 02:37:59.240]  that i guess they're looking at everybody who's saying they're part of this trump
[02:37:59.240 --> 02:38:07.000]  resistance um it's a good place to start but uh we'll see if any of that develops hey by the way
[02:38:07.000 --> 02:38:15.640]  bernie sanders uh in a recent statement he did in franklin county this was yesterday says that he's
[02:38:15.640 --> 02:38:21.160]  going to offer medicare for all soon so bernie sanders yesterday said he's going to offer medicare
[02:38:21.160 --> 02:38:27.000]  for all all right so bernie sanders is also just going to produce doctors out of thin air too and
[02:38:27.000 --> 02:38:32.920]  surgeons it's amazing what bernie sanders can do with just the wave of his head i'm going to bring
[02:38:32.920 --> 02:38:38.920]  you all medicare i'm going to bring you all doctors i'm going to bring you all surgeons
[02:38:38.920 --> 02:38:43.480]  we're going to make brain surgeons out of thin air we're going to make orthopedic surgeons out
[02:38:43.480 --> 02:38:48.040]  of thin air we're going to have all the surgeons and then you can have free surgery free doctors
[02:38:48.040 --> 02:38:53.240]  free health care i don't care if we don't have the money we have to pull it from freddy fave fernie
[02:38:53.240 --> 02:38:57.800]  mack i don't care that we don't have enough doctors here anyway i don't care that most of america
[02:38:57.800 --> 02:39:03.400]  eats themselves sick i don't care i will get you all i will get you all the medicare that i say you
[02:39:03.400 --> 02:39:10.040]  get and if trump passes a medicare bill he's trying to kill your granny let's go to the phone
[02:39:10.040 --> 02:39:16.440]  calls let's start with lauren in ohio lauren why don't you think trump has addressed a antifa
[02:39:17.160 --> 02:39:22.840]  straight head on well because i think what he's trying for is unity to move the people more to
[02:39:22.840 --> 02:39:27.000]  right and wrong so it doesn't matter what group you're in you know how many different groups
[02:39:27.000 --> 02:39:30.360]  that they don't have antifa they'll make up another one you know all these people will
[02:39:31.080 --> 02:39:37.240]  i agree with you i do agree with your your your premise here but still why wouldn't he address
[02:39:37.240 --> 02:39:42.280]  a tifa when he's addressed all the other groups by name well i mean you know you we don't know what
[02:39:42.280 --> 02:39:46.840]  information he has access to they're lying to him on so many different levels i mean look at
[02:39:46.840 --> 02:39:51.640]  he's got muller in there he doesn't even know jeff sessions is working for the clintons and the
[02:39:51.640 --> 02:39:59.720]  bushes jeff sessions is working for the bushes and the clintons what proof do you have of that
[02:39:59.720 --> 02:40:04.040]  statement here this is just my supposition but here's my question why haven't they prosecuted
[02:40:04.040 --> 02:40:08.280]  hillary clinton yet for the email thing it's not like you need an investigation it's all right
[02:40:08.280 --> 02:40:13.880]  i agree i agree and there are movements happening right now now hold on look look okay all right
[02:40:13.880 --> 02:40:20.840]  laura i totally hear your passion i i completely agree with you but guys you cannot expect things
[02:40:20.840 --> 02:40:26.920]  to happen overnight this is so key with people right now they want immediate gratification
[02:40:26.920 --> 02:40:30.680]  they expect things to happen immediately you have to understand how these proceedings work
[02:40:30.680 --> 02:40:34.280]  you're already seeing some of the things being reversed back on muller you're already hearing
[02:40:34.280 --> 02:40:37.640]  calls from muller to testify you're already hearing about things being looked back into
[02:40:37.640 --> 02:40:41.560]  loretta lynch you're already hearing about things being looked back into susan rise so these things
[02:40:41.560 --> 02:40:47.800]  are happening it's happening a lot more slowly than we'd like yes but you have to understand it
[02:40:47.800 --> 02:40:54.440]  takes a long time to build a case now me and you sit here and we say we already know the case it's
[02:40:54.440 --> 02:40:58.520]  already happened we have these people they're caught red-handed laura sillsby caught in haiti
[02:40:58.520 --> 02:41:02.280]  with having children she's not supposed to have oh i'm sure that's just a coincidence you know so
[02:41:02.280 --> 02:41:09.160]  we i get it i understand your frustration you just if you have this if you can make this same phone
[02:41:09.160 --> 02:41:13.880]  call to me in four years then you're a hundred percent right and we've been completely fooled
[02:41:13.880 --> 02:41:19.240]  but it hasn't been four years it hasn't even been one year and maybe they think and here's what i'll
[02:41:19.240 --> 02:41:25.240]  say i think that trump's legal team and trump thinks that they cannot just reach a plea bargain
[02:41:25.240 --> 02:41:31.400]  but also get someone to cooperate they don't want to take down one head and put one person in jail
[02:41:31.400 --> 02:41:36.680]  and then not kill the entire body so they got to get somebody that can sing and they got to get
[02:41:36.680 --> 02:41:41.480]  enough evidence that they can flip that person so i don't know what trump is doing or his legal
[02:41:41.480 --> 02:41:46.280]  team is doing but that's how these things go now as far as why trump hasn't addressed antifa
[02:41:47.240 --> 02:41:53.560]  i think it's because he was waiting for this exact thing to happen now because everyone else has
[02:41:53.560 --> 02:42:00.600]  been ignoring antifa for this entire time until now now they're all in endorsing antifa okay so now
[02:42:00.600 --> 02:42:06.600]  antifa's out there now they've put antifa in the mainstream now they're endorsing antifa will continue
[02:42:06.600 --> 02:42:13.240]  to see antifa antifa be violent so yet it'll be another feather in the cap for the conservatives
[02:42:13.960 --> 02:42:19.400]  who've been calling out antifa now the overall general public who's the drive-by media viewers
[02:42:19.400 --> 02:42:24.520]  will see what antifa really is so then that foreground has been laid for trump to label
[02:42:24.520 --> 02:42:29.240]  them the hate group instead of just coming out and label them it before the mainstream media
[02:42:29.240 --> 02:42:34.040]  fake news got behind them so that's my theory on all that uh thank you for the call laura
[02:42:34.040 --> 02:42:38.520]  let's go to carlos who's calling in from montreal carlos i'm sorry i didn't take your call last
[02:42:38.520 --> 02:42:46.120]  week led here from you now thank you very much for taking my call um president trump has to be
[02:42:46.120 --> 02:42:53.400]  very careful because in canada we had a comparable uh number of years where there were um people who
[02:42:53.400 --> 02:43:00.600]  were agita agit prop they're called the agitators who were financed abroad and they were coming to
[02:43:00.600 --> 02:43:06.600]  montreal to uh promote the partition of canada and now the prime minister at the time was prime
[02:43:06.600 --> 02:43:12.840]  minister trudeau and he held his ground uh waited until in fact things had gotten to the point
[02:43:12.840 --> 02:43:17.400]  that they could be addressed judicially and then at one point they called out the military because
[02:43:17.400 --> 02:43:21.880]  things had gotten out of hand they actually uh killed the the acting premier of the province
[02:43:21.880 --> 02:43:26.760]  of quebec at the time um so you know and it's interesting you bring that out because that
[02:43:26.760 --> 02:43:35.000]  makes me take this a step further here i mean we had three deaths this weekend and i'm not saying
[02:43:35.000 --> 02:43:43.880]  it's specifically antifa's fault but again antifa's there they're always there go ahead carlos finish
[02:43:43.880 --> 02:43:49.400]  your point there is a there is a solution that president trump has to fulfill and from a historic
[02:43:49.400 --> 02:43:55.160]  point of view at this uh the finding moment in american history took place in march uh i believe
[02:43:55.160 --> 02:44:02.440]  2013 and he went unnoticed but i predict that in future historians will address it as being seminal
[02:44:02.440 --> 02:44:09.000]  this point was uh when and uh it was senator ron wyden who was then uh interviewing um
[02:44:09.560 --> 02:44:17.320]  in the in the in the i believe the senate yeah intelligence committee uh to um james clapper
[02:44:17.320 --> 02:44:24.600]  and he asked him to point blank it are you in the ns uh in the nsa uh listening to millions of
[02:44:24.600 --> 02:44:33.160]  americans and the answer that he that clapper gave was um no and not intentionally or yeah not
[02:44:33.160 --> 02:44:37.720]  unwittingly well yeah sure and then you have and then you have the wiki leaks vault seven release
[02:44:37.720 --> 02:44:44.520]  that says exactly what the cia can do in the fbi oh yeah and oh by the way i'm pretty sure that dodge
[02:44:44.520 --> 02:44:53.240]  chargers are notoriously known for being easy to hack yes now dodge charger was the car that was used
[02:44:53.240 --> 02:45:00.440]  to uh kill heather hayer so yeah great points from carlos and montreal um i i i just think that
[02:45:01.080 --> 02:45:05.080]  antifa is bad enough and i wish trump would address them at straight on right now i don't
[02:45:05.080 --> 02:45:10.680]  understand why he's waiting to attack antifa um but i guess you know i'm one of those people they
[02:45:10.680 --> 02:45:14.840]  say oh you're just gonna shield the trump no matter what uh no that's not the case i just call
[02:45:14.840 --> 02:45:22.760]  it as i see it let's go to bill in kentucky go ahead bill yes sir i just wanted to say that uh
[02:45:22.760 --> 02:45:29.880]  i think mr president trump has done an excellent job number one and number two like you said he
[02:45:29.880 --> 02:45:36.920]  we need to give this time my father who's 82 years old said something to me uh in a conversation
[02:45:36.920 --> 02:45:42.120]  recently that makes a lot of sense we need to boil this whole situation all these things that are
[02:45:42.120 --> 02:45:47.880]  going on around the stand a very simple principle and the left uses the principle of what he called
[02:45:47.880 --> 02:45:55.480]  mid mid manipulate intimidate and dominate and those things when you when you break everything
[02:45:55.480 --> 02:46:00.680]  down to the basics that's where we're at that's a very simple way to handle this if you can't be
[02:46:00.680 --> 02:46:05.320]  manipulated you can't be intimidated if you can't be intimidated you can't be dominated
[02:46:05.320 --> 02:46:11.160]  that's a great point and what we're dealing with right now is all of these people that go out on
[02:46:11.160 --> 02:46:17.960]  the streets i'm sorry i feel bad for heather hayer i'm not saying this as somebody that is um
[02:46:18.920 --> 02:46:24.360]  you know not feeling grief or or sad that she's she's dead but she was one of the people that
[02:46:24.360 --> 02:46:30.440]  was manipulated that's what i'm saying she got manipulated by fake news she thought she was
[02:46:30.440 --> 02:46:35.320]  going out there representing a struggle about some fake struggle made up in the fake news media
[02:46:35.320 --> 02:46:42.040]  that she was out there representing a total lie and now she's dead that's the manipulation go ahead
[02:46:42.040 --> 02:46:49.480]  bill it's on to you uh alex because you know i see the frustration that he faces on a daily basis
[02:46:49.480 --> 02:46:55.320]  and like i said you know in life when you when you boil things down to the to the basics it sure
[02:46:55.320 --> 02:47:00.680]  helps you deal with it it's tough it's tough to boil things down when our pot is so full
[02:47:00.680 --> 02:47:06.840]  but things can really be boiled down and it should be boiled down to america first we're all americans
[02:47:06.840 --> 02:47:13.400]  first but we can't even do that because as you identified people have been so manipulated by
[02:47:13.400 --> 02:47:20.840]  propaganda and then intimidated told their erasist and then dominated by the media with fake news
[02:47:20.840 --> 02:47:28.040]  thank you for the call bill let's go to ferris in new york go ahead ferris you know i like carlos
[02:47:28.040 --> 02:47:34.440]  at montreal and i like bill in kentucky but i love laura she's uh demonstrating that she's probably
[02:47:34.440 --> 02:47:40.040]  a man trapped in a woman's body because she's thinking whoa whoa there's there's 87 genders sir
[02:47:40.040 --> 02:47:46.520]  please don't be uh genderphobic well i'm not i'm just simply explaining that it's a women
[02:47:46.520 --> 02:47:53.160]  primary nature is to feel and the men's primary primary sir sir you're trying to teach me biology
[02:47:53.160 --> 02:47:59.000]  right now that is sexist yeah let me stop it with your sexist biology ferris take a day off
[02:48:00.280 --> 02:48:06.280]  the uh the quarterback on this charlottesville and thanks for what you do and pass our gratitude
[02:48:06.280 --> 02:48:15.320]  on to alex jones we understand the uh what he goes through to uh follow his passion uh and it is ours
[02:48:15.320 --> 02:48:21.960]  and we say maga and we say america first but the quarterback on the charlottesville thing of course
[02:48:21.960 --> 02:48:27.800]  is an indigent uh african-american man named west bellamy i'm going to spell for all your google
[02:48:27.800 --> 02:48:35.720]  is b-e-l-l-a-m-y west bellamy vice mayor of charlottesville is the man who received the largesse
[02:48:36.440 --> 02:48:44.120]  from uh soros's lesbians who pay out all of the uh manipulative people in all these key towns and
[02:48:44.120 --> 02:48:50.200]  cities you see that kind of wealth is hard to come by for a man like west bellamy but he was
[02:48:50.200 --> 02:48:57.320]  bought and sold by soros and and simply realized that this is a great opportunity to for the police
[02:48:57.320 --> 02:49:03.400]  to lead a riot yeah no i no no no see see now you're hitting the nail on the head and i said this
[02:49:03.400 --> 02:49:11.720]  already if you don't think that police officers or governors or mayors or committee men or whoever
[02:49:11.720 --> 02:49:17.160]  it is that hate trump that are in those roles aren't just as desperate as the rest of them
[02:49:17.160 --> 02:49:23.160]  and won't act just as desperately and won't pull off fake crimes won't pull off hoaxes won't pull
[02:49:23.160 --> 02:49:28.040]  off staged events to demonize trump to demonize what they think is their enemy to try to bring down
[02:49:28.040 --> 02:49:32.520]  this country you are a fool and i'm not saying you're a fool ferris you completely understand
[02:49:32.520 --> 02:49:39.560]  but that's that that is so key that is just that is literally on point go ahead well uh they're all
[02:49:39.560 --> 02:49:43.080]  dirty oh and by the way i'm sorry to interrupt you again but you made another point that needs to be
[02:49:43.080 --> 02:49:53.000]  brought up how is it we have politicians like obama nancy pelosi they get into office people
[02:49:53.000 --> 02:49:58.440]  of very menial means not loaded not totally wealthy but they have it and then they get out of office
[02:49:58.440 --> 02:50:04.600]  and they're millionaires where are they getting this money how is nobody asking this i'm sorry
[02:50:04.600 --> 02:50:09.560]  ferris finish the segment 30 seconds well we are we are asking the question and thanks for
[02:50:09.560 --> 02:50:14.920]  amplifying it but the point is that everyone would sell out for the kind of money that soros is
[02:50:14.920 --> 02:50:19.560]  throwing around you tell me about the exceptions tell me about yourself tell me about alex jones
[02:50:19.560 --> 02:50:26.120]  tell me about me but uh it's a very compelling thing when when this kind of money is dangled
[02:50:26.120 --> 02:50:33.480]  in front of you which is limitless and the man's pockets are bottomless and the politicians need
[02:50:33.480 --> 02:50:41.320]  that money they need that money they oh no give me that soros money i'm hillary clinton give me
[02:50:41.320 --> 02:50:46.440]  another quarter of a hundred thousand dollars george boy i'm david rock i funnel money back and

[03:00:47.320 --> 03:00:53.480]  and jake tapper is going to call out info wars for lies see this is what jake tapper would do
[03:00:53.480 --> 03:00:58.760]  this is how dumb he is he would come on the air and he would start it off by asking alex jones
[03:00:58.760 --> 03:01:05.720]  about gay frogs that's how stupid jake tapper is they don't even realize that the gay frog meme
[03:01:05.720 --> 03:01:12.920]  that they try to use against alex jones is actually real i have a you know what i have a
[03:01:12.920 --> 03:01:20.040]  feeling jake tapper is going to erase that tweet i'm gonna call it and if he doesn't
[03:01:20.760 --> 03:01:29.720]  and he doesn't debate alex jones live then he's a coward he's a total coward let's go to steve in
[03:01:29.720 --> 03:01:37.640]  virginia go ahead steve hey oh and uh you were spot on with uh your take in charlottesville
[03:01:37.640 --> 03:01:43.640]  the only thing you didn't mention is that the commonwealth of virginia and the state police are
[03:01:43.640 --> 03:01:50.040]  also culpable for the death of the woman because they did not put up concrete roadblocks to stop
[03:01:50.040 --> 03:02:00.520]  traffic and as far as antifa antifa is just like uh you know with antifa and juror soros it reminds
[03:02:00.520 --> 03:02:06.440]  you of the 60s race riots where the communist russians funded the black panthers and they
[03:02:06.440 --> 03:02:12.200]  wanted to create race riots in the south so the south the seas from the u.s it's just like what
[03:02:12.200 --> 03:02:16.760]  soros does all across the world and it's an amazing point you bring up about the traffic thing
[03:02:16.760 --> 03:02:21.960]  i'm telling you this thing was so staged folks this thing was so staged it's not even funny
[03:02:21.960 --> 03:02:27.800]  just look at the way the road was again you've got these cars in the road apparently one of the
[03:02:27.800 --> 03:02:31.720]  cars doesn't even have a driver in it it's just sitting in the middle of the road and then the
[03:02:31.720 --> 03:02:36.840]  road is wide open for this challenger to go ram into these cars and then the road is wide open
[03:02:36.840 --> 03:02:42.120]  for this non-professional driver supposed to be all hopped up on psychotropic drugs to speed
[03:02:42.120 --> 03:02:47.480]  out backwards perfectly like a professional driver and then drive away disappear cops magically
[03:02:47.480 --> 03:02:51.160]  find him later the police helicopter that would have seen the whole thing goes down and those two
[03:02:51.160 --> 03:02:59.160]  police officers die yeah sounds legit to me then the biggest joke is these governors they oh they
[03:02:59.160 --> 03:03:04.840]  call the national guard put them on standby but the reality is the only way you keep the group
[03:03:04.840 --> 03:03:10.760]  separated is national guard troops with m16s and bayonets that's the only thing they'll ever
[03:03:10.760 --> 03:03:17.000]  understand anything less is just a joke but really is well here's the thing they're trying
[03:03:17.000 --> 03:03:21.400]  to take away our free speech at any time you try to organize and have a march and tifa's
[03:03:21.400 --> 03:03:26.200]  going to show up now the mainstream fake news is going to prop them up as heroes so they're
[03:03:26.200 --> 03:03:31.240]  going to be even more empowered now you got another march that's going to happen in virginia
[03:03:31.240 --> 03:03:35.720]  about a roberty lee statue or some confederate statue it's only going to get worse it's only
[03:03:35.720 --> 03:03:40.840]  going to heat up and there are i mean look obviously there's fringe white right-wingers out there
[03:03:40.840 --> 03:03:47.960]  that are crazy enough that are dumb enough to pick up a torch and march in the name of white
[03:03:47.960 --> 03:03:56.920]  nationalism behind richard spencer yeah if you do that you're a fringe jackass absolutely thank

[03:05:57.880 --> 03:06:05.160]  of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense 60 years ago when foreign air forces were
[03:06:05.160 --> 03:06:12.200]  approaching filled with bombs they had drums of their own air raid sirens but in the 21st century
[03:06:12.200 --> 03:06:18.040]  there are silent weapons for quiet war pathogens added to the food and water into the lining of

[03:08:04.840 --> 03:08:11.880]  got 30 seconds tell me about the nra disney song go ahead max all right you know that sweet sweet
[03:08:11.880 --> 03:08:19.240]  honey uh dana dana loach that ad you just have on lu you know i have a good eye but my ears not as
[03:08:19.240 --> 03:08:24.680]  good as alex so you know i i swear i heard that song from somewhere i was listening to that song
[03:08:24.680 --> 03:08:30.920]  in the background maybe nico back there can bring it up uh and then cross reference that and you know
[03:08:30.920 --> 03:08:36.440]  that in the age of youtube the algorithms will pick it up right away i mean if i have a five second
[03:08:36.440 --> 03:08:43.160]  two second clip the algorithms are going to pick it up but if you search the on youtube the song from
[03:08:43.160 --> 03:08:48.920]  disney uh fly away so you think that they use that song hold on i think i see where you're going so
[03:08:48.920 --> 03:08:57.400]  you think that they use that song so that youtube would censor the ad no no i think that i'm like
[03:08:57.400 --> 03:09:04.600]  total with uh curtain you know i think that there is the swamp is very deep this stuff is deep rooted
[03:09:04.600 --> 03:09:09.960]  it a lot of money like that other color i don't think a disney song being played in the background
[03:09:10.680 --> 03:09:14.680]  i don't think a disney song being played in the background of that nra video necessarily indicates
[03:09:14.680 --> 03:09:20.440]  that i suppose that that's what max is thinking what i think is funny is that you have all of these
[03:09:20.440 --> 03:09:26.680]  liberal groups that are funded by soros attacking dana lesh and attacking the nra dana lesh isn't
[03:09:26.680 --> 03:09:33.400]  perfect okay uh nobody is perfect i disagree with a lot of things dana lesh says on her radio show
[03:09:33.400 --> 03:09:39.240]  she's not my enemy and i agree with her stances on the second amendment and it's amazing that all
[03:09:39.240 --> 03:09:44.120]  these liberal groups all these soros funded groups are attacking lesh attacking the nra
[03:09:45.480 --> 03:09:51.160]  to which i spurred both of them i said why aren't you moving to sue these people that are libelous
[03:09:51.160 --> 03:09:56.280]  against you so you've got alex jones ready to get to litigate you've got diamond and silk ready
[03:09:56.280 --> 03:10:01.800]  to litigate jack passovic is about to be in court testifying against antifa it's time to just
[03:10:01.800 --> 03:10:06.760]  try to litigate these people and we need conservative lawyers and attorneys to step up
[03:10:07.560 --> 03:10:13.560]  and to take this battle into the courts where trump is now appointing conservative judges
[03:10:13.560 --> 03:10:17.640]  putting his mark on the court where the liberal judges have had their mark on the court putting
[03:10:17.640 --> 03:10:24.760]  away people like sheriff joe arpaio for following the law now folks we're being led into a civil war
[03:10:25.560 --> 03:10:30.680]  and when i say i feel bad for heather mayer because she got tricked into being out on the
[03:10:30.680 --> 03:10:37.240]  streets for a struggle that is brought to her by fake news this is exactly what i'm talking about
[03:10:37.240 --> 03:10:41.560]  they've attacked trump for so long they've demonized trump supporters for so long
[03:10:41.560 --> 03:10:47.320]  they are the ones that have metastasized this environment they are the ones that have been
[03:10:47.320 --> 03:10:52.360]  terraforming this environment for a civil war here's some of these clips let's start with msnbc
[03:10:52.360 --> 03:10:57.800]  calling trump a racist the southern poverty law center website says there are nine hundred
[03:10:57.800 --> 03:11:03.960]  poverty law centers across the country are are we regressing as a nation that rejects this important
[03:11:03.960 --> 03:11:11.400]  ideology yeah i think we absolutely are i mean look i think the important thing to say in all
[03:11:11.400 --> 03:11:17.720]  of this or perhaps one of the important things to say is the incredible responsibility uh
[03:11:17.720 --> 03:11:25.960]  that donald trump has oh you know this uh rally that led to the uh terrorist attack was uh built
[03:11:25.960 --> 03:11:31.880]  as unite the right i think none of the kind of bottom feeders who are actually there leading
[03:11:31.880 --> 03:11:38.600]  this uh organization this rally uh had the kind of responsibility that in fact donald trump has
[03:11:38.600 --> 03:11:44.440]  had you know let's not forget this is a man who from the very beginning and even before his campaign
[03:11:44.440 --> 03:11:49.400]  was essentially an unfarnished trump is more guilty than the guy that drove the car according
[03:11:49.400 --> 03:11:54.680]  to this morning we're coming after these people this kind of hate will not be tolerated it cannot
[03:11:54.680 --> 03:12:00.120]  be tolerated in america does it ring true to you do you believe that this administration
[03:12:00.120 --> 03:12:08.600]  is going to do something now it rings absolutely false to me uh you know jeff sessions uh is in
[03:12:08.600 --> 03:12:13.000]  charge of a justice department that recently decided the great problem with diversity in this
[03:12:13.000 --> 03:12:19.240]  country uh is that white people are being supposedly denied admission to colleges based on their
[03:12:19.240 --> 03:12:25.000]  skin color uh that to jeff's oh yeah as if that doesn't happen because of affirmative action so uh
[03:12:25.000 --> 03:12:30.520]  you know i think the reality let's also remember that that's the reality you as the head of his
[03:12:30.520 --> 03:12:37.640]  commission looking at supposed voter fraud chris kobak uh the uh chief votes uh uh
[03:12:37.640 --> 03:12:43.240]  kansas secretary of state of kansas so no i think the you know i think there are many people within
[03:12:43.240 --> 03:12:50.120]  doj and the civil rights division who are absolutely good people but the leadership is rotten uh the
[03:12:50.120 --> 03:12:55.720]  stink is coming from the top mark potock i say good to see you it is good to see you although we
[03:12:55.720 --> 03:13:01.880]  are often only speaking under these uh very extraordinarily unfortunate horrible circumstances
[03:13:01.880 --> 03:13:08.280]  but i thank you so much for your yeah that guy being on air is a horrible unfortunate circumstance
[03:13:08.280 --> 03:13:13.640]  that guy opening his mouth and having an opinion is a very unfortunate circumstance
[03:13:14.680 --> 03:13:23.480]  let's now move on to donnie douche on trump saying he's a racist now morning joe contributor donnie
[03:13:23.480 --> 03:13:29.320]  douche we understand why he had to go out and say something but they viewed this as a victory for

[03:13:35.560 --> 03:13:40.200]  little man says the pathetic snivering little man on morning joe step back for a second as far as what

[03:14:11.000 --> 03:14:17.400]  fake news these are the people all these people that i'm playing right now from television news

[03:14:23.880 --> 03:14:28.680]  to go in the streets and protest racism they are the ones that told heather higher to go on the
[03:14:28.680 --> 03:14:34.200]  streets and protest trump they are the ones still saying that they were can they will continue the
[03:14:34.200 --> 03:14:41.560]  struggle that heather higher died for folks heather higher died for a fake struggle you know the
[03:14:41.560 --> 03:14:49.240]  saying the struggle is real the struggle is fake the struggle is fake and it's sniveling snot-nosed
[03:14:49.240 --> 03:14:56.520]  punks whose who justice will only befell them when they die and go to hell that are responsible for
[03:14:56.520 --> 03:15:04.120]  this go on with the clip african-americans the nazis are built on the columns of ate off hitler
[03:15:04.120 --> 03:15:08.440]  of exterminating jews or soros who's a nazi you sniveling punks we don't think jews should exist
[03:15:08.440 --> 03:15:12.280]  on this planet we're going to exterminate that's what world war two was about president trump has
[03:15:12.280 --> 03:15:17.560]  jews and his family can you not condemn those people he didn't condemn ten times is that what
[03:15:17.560 --> 03:15:25.160]  this is it is so disgusting and repulsive and no you're disgusting and repulsive when you watched
[03:15:25.160 --> 03:15:29.640]  him speak you literally make my blood boil we've seen him speak passionately when the first part
[03:15:29.640 --> 03:15:33.960]  of it he was almost reading that text almost like he wanted to and then when he got animated
[03:15:33.960 --> 03:15:39.080]  was when he got to the many sides part the many sides you know joe has asked me many times on
[03:15:39.080 --> 03:15:43.080]  this show you know donnie you and i have known trump for years he says racist things but he's not
[03:15:43.080 --> 03:15:48.680]  really racist no he is a racist he is a racist can we just say it once and for all why can't
[03:15:48.680 --> 03:15:54.120]  why do his ass when you look at me he's talked about reverse discrimination against whites
[03:15:54.120 --> 03:15:58.840]  the birth movement we have a racist as a president because a man that cannot stand up
[03:15:58.840 --> 03:16:04.840]  and condemn the kukucks clan oh my god is a racist yeah he's only condemned him a hundred
[03:16:04.840 --> 03:16:10.840]  thousand times and here this donnie douche goes on the air makes up lies about president trump
[03:16:10.840 --> 03:16:16.520]  slanders president trump gets away with it and then heather hyer goes out in the streets and dies
[03:16:16.520 --> 03:16:24.920]  for the very lies that donnie douche just told you on msnbc only the devil only the devil will
[03:16:24.920 --> 03:16:31.400]  have justice for you let's now go to abc no i'm sorry let's go to face the nation cbs that says
[03:16:31.400 --> 03:16:36.280]  trump is a racist go ahead jimela president says he wants to find out what happened in
[03:16:36.280 --> 03:16:42.920]  trawlsville and seek for the roots of this what's your reaction to that my i think reaction
[03:16:42.920 --> 03:16:48.760]  is so serious here on this panel but if you're looking for the roots of white white supremacists
[03:16:48.760 --> 03:16:52.520]  we weren't this upset when the black lives matter protest killed multiple police officers we don't
[03:16:52.520 --> 03:16:57.000]  have to look we weren't this upset was d. scully scott shut we weren't this serious when clayton
[03:16:57.000 --> 03:17:01.800]  carter killed his g.o.p. committeeman neighbor a trump hater but we're very upset now whether
[03:17:01.800 --> 03:17:06.120]  yes very serious david duke that he refused to condemn whether he hasn't condemned any of these
[03:17:06.120 --> 03:17:11.240]  people he's literally oh my god oh my god or keter just shut my mic off into the white house
[03:17:11.240 --> 03:17:16.760]  you look at the president's behavior and at a certain point you you're going to have to say
[03:17:16.760 --> 03:17:20.920]  that maybe the reason he doesn't condemn these people is because it's one way or another he
[03:17:20.920 --> 03:17:27.400]  may see them in allies see them as part of his activist base um and that i don't know how one
[03:17:27.400 --> 03:17:33.160]  deals with that but if if you're trying to examine the roots of this um then i think i think you have
[03:17:33.160 --> 03:17:39.240]  to look there these people are lower than scum i had to have the crew turn my mic off because i
[03:17:39.240 --> 03:17:45.640]  i can't even handle this let's now go to abc the week saying trump is racist and even more so i
[03:17:45.640 --> 03:17:50.120]  think when you take about this who shares responsibility in this who shares responsibility
[03:17:50.120 --> 03:17:54.360]  it's not only the man it's not only the movement but anybody that points their fingers at mexicans
[03:17:54.360 --> 03:17:58.600]  and muslims shares responsibility as well the president has to share responsibility the fact
[03:17:58.600 --> 03:18:03.800]  is is that through that campaign he blew all kinds of whistles that those of us who grew up in the
[03:18:03.800 --> 03:18:10.760]  jim crow south like i did recognized immediately it was just calling out to these white supremacists
[03:18:10.760 --> 03:18:15.240]  who then felt empowered by it and the president now not calling them out you know he should
[03:18:15.240 --> 03:18:20.760]  listen to nicky harry calling his now u.n. ambassador she's the person who started bringing down
[03:18:20.760 --> 03:18:26.200]  confederate monuments to the point and she did it so graciously and exactly the right tone
[03:18:26.200 --> 03:18:30.440]  after the killings at mother immanuel church to the point of those involved by the president's
[03:18:30.440 --> 03:18:35.320]  words david duke on friday night alex and my husband said we're determined to take our country
[03:18:35.320 --> 03:18:39.160]  back we're going to fulfill the promises of donald trump that's what we believed in that's
[03:18:39.160 --> 03:18:43.880]  where we voted for donald trump the president can't seem to find the words to denounce that
[03:18:43.880 --> 03:18:48.840]  but this is also a really watershed moment for the justice department because it's not just
[03:18:48.840 --> 03:18:55.320]  that the categorizing these hate crimes jeff sessions has gone backwards on a lot of these
[03:18:55.320 --> 03:19:01.320]  things having to do with race taking a look at the obama federal investigations of how police
[03:19:01.320 --> 03:19:06.680]  treat people of color he's saying let's not do that anymore he's saying let's let's keep voting
[03:19:06.680 --> 03:19:12.200]  rights suppressed he's doing a lot of things that send signals to these white supremacists
[03:19:12.200 --> 03:19:15.240]  all right now meet the press claims trump is racist roll that one
[03:19:17.880 --> 03:19:21.800]  so all these people saying trump's racism what happened in the people who carried out the act
[03:19:21.800 --> 03:19:27.160]  totally made up in charlottesville on many sides and he had many times many tweets where he could
[03:19:27.160 --> 03:19:32.520]  have corrected that where he could have gone further and didn't know i mean it's a look you
[03:19:32.520 --> 03:19:37.080]  can't say it's anything other than deliberate he has a reputation for not being afraid to call
[03:19:37.080 --> 03:19:43.320]  individuals out whether they're members of the media politicians that make them upset

[03:21:02.760 --> 03:21:09.000]  better nutrition than we do today and our ancient ancestors sought out the bones of the animals that
[03:21:09.000 --> 03:21:14.360]  they were hunting killing and then processing and so i set out to develop caveman but to not

[03:24:13.320 --> 03:24:19.880]  possibly do on radio is to sit here and play for you five clips in a row of mainstream television
[03:24:19.880 --> 03:24:25.560]  cable news telling you trump is a racist we just played the five clips we dozens of pundits and
[03:24:25.560 --> 03:24:30.840]  this is just a small smattering of it but you noticed one thing didn't you you noticed one
[03:24:30.840 --> 03:24:35.640]  thing about all these people claiming trump is a racist they didn't provide any evidence
[03:24:36.760 --> 03:24:41.880]  they didn't provide any clips they didn't provide any sound they didn't provide any facts
[03:24:41.880 --> 03:24:46.520]  they didn't provide any evidence just conjecture just accusations
[03:24:50.520 --> 03:24:58.920]  yes it's it's really hard to come on air and know that there is an attempt to bring down america
[03:24:58.920 --> 03:25:07.080]  to start a civil war know who the liars in the media are call them out and then still you have
[03:25:07.080 --> 03:25:13.560]  people like heather higher who go out on the streets and have now died for the very lies that
[03:25:13.560 --> 03:25:20.440]  are spewed out every day by mainstream news and they say that we will continue to struggle
[03:25:20.440 --> 03:25:29.720]  for the struggle that heather died for lies literally liars on television who provide zero
[03:25:29.720 --> 03:25:33.800]  evidence of their claims i am sitting here telling you that i believe it's mainstream
[03:25:33.800 --> 03:25:39.000]  television news forcing heather higher into the street then she dies and then i play the clips
[03:25:39.000 --> 03:25:44.840]  proving it they tell you trump's racist all day long plays zero clips they tell you trump has never
[03:25:44.840 --> 03:25:52.360]  condemned any of this violence even though he's done it over and over and over and over and over
[03:25:52.360 --> 03:25:58.440]  so now here's a clip again of mainstream television news trying to demonize president trump
[03:26:01.800 --> 03:26:08.200]  specifically condemn what happened in the people who carried out the act allegedly in charlottesville
[03:26:08.200 --> 03:26:12.680]  on many sides and he had many times many tweets where he could have corrected that where he could
[03:26:12.680 --> 03:26:18.840]  have gone further and didn't no i mean it's a look you can't say it's anything other than deliberate
[03:26:18.840 --> 03:26:24.600]  he has a reputation for not being afraid to call individuals out um uh whether they're members of
[03:26:24.600 --> 03:26:32.280]  the media uh politicians that make them upset uh fellow world leaders so we know he's capable
[03:26:32.280 --> 03:26:37.320]  of singling folks out talking about nazis you're talking about the kkk you're talking about white
[03:26:37.320 --> 03:26:42.920]  supremacists if you can't come out and easily and readily and quickly condemn that what can you do
[03:26:43.480 --> 03:26:47.800]  no and the ambiguity there you know mark sanford uh the congressman from south carolina
[03:26:47.800 --> 03:26:52.520]  he i want to give him credit for this quote he has said president uh candidate donald trump's
[03:26:52.520 --> 03:26:57.960]  campaign unleashed a demon that's been out here oh that was you that was you that unleashed the
[03:26:57.960 --> 03:27:02.040]  demon with your lies and your fake news so here's them lying about president trump saying he's racist
[03:27:02.040 --> 03:27:07.480]  he's never condemned violence again i give to you the clip of a compilation of president trump
[03:27:07.480 --> 03:27:13.800]  condemning violence they never said to white nationalists explicitly and if he did i can't
[03:27:13.800 --> 03:27:18.600]  remember off the top of my head but i don't think he did uh say he never said i don't want your support
[03:27:18.600 --> 03:27:28.040]  don't vote for me i don't think he did i was there every day i didn't even know he endorsed me
[03:27:28.040 --> 03:27:35.400]  david duke endorsed me okay all right i disavow okay i totally disavow the klu Klux plan i totally
[03:27:35.400 --> 03:27:41.240]  disavow david duke i've been doing it now for two weeks this is your probably about the 18th person
[03:27:41.240 --> 03:27:48.760]  that's asked me the question uh david duke is a bad person who i disavowed on numerous occasions
[03:27:48.760 --> 03:27:57.960]  over the years what he didn't do is say that that he was not going to accept the support of any
[03:27:57.960 --> 03:28:05.160]  of these fringe groups i've reject david duke rejected david duke i've rejected the kkk the
[03:28:05.160 --> 03:28:11.320]  klu Klux plan from the time i'm five years old i rejected them donald trump refusing to condemn
[03:28:11.320 --> 03:28:17.080]  former klu Klux clan grand wizard david duke what do you see as the biggest problem this is 17 years
[03:28:17.080 --> 03:28:23.720]  prior well you've got david duke just joined a bigot a racist a problem trump brings david duke
[03:28:23.720 --> 03:28:29.960]  up in an interview to disavow him 17 years ago on friday i disavow why ask him again on saturday
[03:28:29.960 --> 03:28:38.200]  all right okay so we get the point folks you have to ask yourself how is it that for 20 years
[03:28:38.200 --> 03:28:43.480]  president trump can disavow this crap for the entire time leading up to the presidential election
[03:28:43.480 --> 03:28:48.280]  president trump can disavow this crap then on the weekend of all the violence president trump
[03:28:48.280 --> 03:28:54.440]  disavows this crap multiple times on twitter multiple times in press conference disavows
[03:28:54.440 --> 03:28:59.640]  condemns all of it the whole nine yards calls them all out except for the leftists he doesn't
[03:28:59.640 --> 03:29:06.200]  touch the leftists he leaves the leftist alone quote unquote leftist antifa and it doesn't
[03:29:06.200 --> 03:29:11.880]  even matter that for years for interviews phone calls everything across the board condemning
[03:29:11.880 --> 03:29:16.920]  disavowing the liars in media still get on television and tell you he's never done it
[03:29:16.920 --> 03:29:22.040]  the liars in television media still go on tv and tell you he's a racist and then they want to blame
[03:29:22.040 --> 03:29:28.200]  trump when their own minions go out on the streets to protest trump who they lied about
[03:29:28.200 --> 03:29:35.640]  and then die and then they blame trump this is this is wackier than the twilight zone folks
[03:29:35.640 --> 03:29:46.200]  we're on the march the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network
[03:29:48.360 --> 03:29:53.880]  joe vicks here with info wars dot com today i want to talk to you about guns why we have them
[03:29:53.880 --> 03:29:59.480]  why the bill of rights guarantees that we can have them and why my right to have a gun is more
[03:29:59.480 --> 03:30:04.840]  important than your right to rail against it in the press i believe every good journalist needs
[03:30:04.840 --> 03:30:10.360]  to know why the second amendment must be considered more essential than the first amendment this may
[03:30:10.360 --> 03:30:17.000]  be a bitter pill to swallow but the right to keep and bear arms is not an outdated dusty idea some
[03:30:17.000 --> 03:30:22.760]  old dead white guys dreamed up in fear of the redcoats now it is just as essential to liberty
[03:30:22.760 --> 03:30:29.480]  today as it was in 1776 the original amendments we refer to as the bill of rights contained 10 of
[03:30:29.480 --> 03:30:35.560]  what the constitutional framers termed unalienable rights the bill of rights came to us with blinders
[03:30:35.560 --> 03:30:41.960]  on it doesn't recognize color or class or wealth it protects not just the rights of actors or editors
[03:30:41.960 --> 03:30:48.360]  or reporters but extends even to those we love to hate this is a small excerpt from trawlton heston

[03:35:59.480 --> 03:36:06.440]  you're covering the civil war for america and you have outright liars lying about the president
[03:36:06.440 --> 03:36:11.960]  of the united states and providing zero evidence and then you have poor manipulated brainwashed
[03:36:11.960 --> 03:36:19.880]  fools i'm sorry again not to sound insensitive but that was heather hair that's why she went out
[03:36:19.880 --> 03:36:26.840]  and marched that's why she died here's a clip put together by our own darin mcbreen trump versus the
[03:36:26.840 --> 03:36:31.480]  mainstream media the fact that it took the president two days to come out and clearly
[03:36:31.480 --> 03:36:37.640]  denounced racist and white supremacist is shameful and i think he finally spoke out that is a lie
[03:36:37.640 --> 03:36:43.720]  that is a lie that is a lie that is a lie excuse me go ahead at the president's original comments
[03:36:43.720 --> 03:36:49.560]  on all of this this all happened before a madman plowed into a group of people with his car here's
[03:36:49.560 --> 03:36:55.960]  what president trump tweeted quote we all must be united and condemn all that hate stands for it
[03:36:55.960 --> 03:37:01.320]  there's no place for this kind of violence in america let's come together as one president also
[03:37:01.320 --> 03:37:08.680]  said we must remember this truth no matter our color creed religion or political party we are all
[03:37:08.680 --> 03:37:14.840]  americans first if you're looking for the roots of why white supremacist neo nazis felt emboldened
[03:37:14.840 --> 03:37:20.360]  to march on a college town you don't have to look very far from the white house we have a racist
[03:37:20.360 --> 03:37:27.640]  as a president because a man that cannot stand up and condemn the kukaps clan and nazism is a racist
[03:37:27.640 --> 03:37:32.840]  he was a coward he didn't have the spine to behave like the leader of the united states
[03:37:32.840 --> 03:37:39.080]  and i feel that to be shameful he's not only unfit to be president in my book his lack of empathy
[03:37:39.080 --> 03:37:44.520]  his lack of leadership his lack of courage he's unfit to be human even after a few hours to think
[03:37:44.520 --> 03:37:50.280]  about it the best he could do was squeezing this response before a bill signing we condemn in the
[03:37:50.280 --> 03:37:58.680]  strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred bigotry and violence on many sides
[03:37:58.680 --> 03:38:07.000]  on many sides wait on many sides this was a white nationalist rally you have to call that out by
[03:38:07.000 --> 03:38:14.520]  name racism is evil and those who cause violence in its name are criminals and thugs including the
[03:38:14.520 --> 03:38:23.640]  kkk neo nazis white supremacists and other hate groups that are repugnant to everything we hold
[03:38:23.640 --> 03:38:30.040]  dear as americans they don't want to mention antifa and how antifa literally came trained
[03:38:30.040 --> 03:38:36.200]  militarized doing warlike maneuvers you know they bring uh coolers and you think oh it's
[03:38:36.200 --> 03:38:41.960]  just dehydrated no it's filled with water balloons filled with feces urine just discussing things that
[03:38:41.960 --> 03:38:45.800]  will pop and explode on people and water bottles filled with the same substances
[03:38:55.480 --> 03:38:57.720]  yeah he just got struck with pepper spray
[03:38:59.400 --> 03:39:04.520]  by some liberal helping him we're not all like this no you see that guy attacked him it's not a
[03:39:04.520 --> 03:39:09.240]  liberal he's a marxist every time one of these situations happens you know you see the worst
[03:39:09.240 --> 03:39:14.600]  of people sometimes i think we saw it out of the left this egregious display of hatred bigotry
[03:39:15.480 --> 03:39:19.880]  and violence on many sides on many sides many sides
[03:39:23.320 --> 03:39:31.480]  mr president mr president this is terrorism not your order at kfc after two days of intense
[03:39:31.480 --> 03:39:36.120]  public pressure today the president was finally willing to say that nazis are bad how can you
[03:39:36.120 --> 03:39:41.000]  possibly say you condemn this in the strongest possible terms when you don't even name the
[03:39:41.000 --> 03:39:47.400]  groups responsible trump has a permanent hard on for condemnation and yet when it came time to
[03:39:47.400 --> 03:39:55.080]  condemn white supremacists and nazis it was limp city obama and i both share some responsibility
[03:39:55.080 --> 03:40:01.720]  here i mean i embraced all right racist obama was black we both contributed to the problem in our own
[03:40:01.720 --> 03:40:06.840]  way you know the liberal media couldn't control themselves they couldn't resist the opportunity
[03:40:06.840 --> 03:40:11.560]  to somehow turn this on president trump i was proud of the original statement he knows the
[03:40:11.560 --> 03:40:15.560]  president you have to be measured you have to be calm you want to calm the waters you want to be
[03:40:15.560 --> 03:40:19.480]  thoughtful in your initial statement because it's early on and you don't have all the facts and you
[03:40:19.480 --> 03:40:23.960]  don't want to speak out of hand then over the weekend as he learned more facts he came out today
[03:40:23.960 --> 03:40:29.160]  and and reiterated what he said and even some more forceful terms i was proud of the way he handled that
[03:40:29.160 --> 03:40:38.280]  the reason why i believe it is quote unquote liberal or leftist media that is inciting a civil war
[03:40:38.840 --> 03:40:46.440]  and trying to start a coup against our president our elected president donald trump george soros
[03:40:46.440 --> 03:40:53.080]  is behind a lot of that and antifa is behind a lot of the violence black lives matter we're among
[03:40:53.080 --> 03:40:59.240]  some of those counter protesters uh draw a distinction for me if you will well i think
[03:40:59.240 --> 03:41:05.000]  what's important in this moment is uh white nationalists are actually fighting to take away
[03:41:05.000 --> 03:41:11.720]  people's rights uh black lives matter and groups like black lives matter are fighting for equality
[03:41:11.720 --> 03:41:24.520]  president did you explain why you do not condemn those patients by the end of the weekend they've been condemned they have been condemned can we ask you some more questions
[03:41:25.640 --> 03:41:28.840]  that was in the voice of jim acosta our senior white house correspondent chatting the questions to
[03:41:28.840 --> 03:41:32.760]  the president about why didn't you condemn the racist clashes over the weekend and charleston
[03:41:32.760 --> 03:41:36.120]  earlier he said they've been condemned they've been condemned and they was yelling i think it was yelling it
[03:41:36.120 --> 03:41:42.520]  back in jim your fake news right this is donald trump over the years something to destroy trump
[03:41:42.520 --> 03:41:48.760]  media will never show you condemning duke white supremacists look what are your views on the
[03:41:48.760 --> 03:41:56.600]  kuklutz clan and white supremacists i totally disavow the kuklutz clan i totally disavow
[03:41:56.600 --> 03:42:01.240]  david duke i've been doing it now for two weeks this is your probably about the 18th person
[03:42:01.240 --> 03:42:05.800]  that's asked me the question i didn't even know he endorsed me david duke endorsed me okay all right
[03:42:05.800 --> 03:42:14.200]  i disavow david duke announced his senate candidacy claiming your agenda for his own or he essentially
[03:42:14.200 --> 03:42:18.440]  saying glad that you spoke out are you ready before you ask the question newt gingrich said every
[03:42:18.440 --> 03:42:24.120]  republican should repeat this guy no matter what it takes and i do rebuked is that okay rebuked done
[03:42:24.120 --> 03:42:29.320]  what do you see as the biggest problem with the reform party right now well you've got david duke
[03:42:29.320 --> 03:42:35.400]  just joined a bigot a racist a problem i mean this is not exactly the people you want in your party
[03:42:35.400 --> 03:42:42.760]  i say red baseball caps mean you're an ass
[03:42:42.760 --> 03:42:50.840]  my gosh it all just hit me with that clip that darin mcgreen put together it all just made sense to
[03:42:50.840 --> 03:43:04.600]  me folks president trump is like the most tolerant patient man in the history of the world if i had
[03:43:04.600 --> 03:43:10.440]  all of this media all of these people and the streets all these people on social media lying
[03:43:10.440 --> 03:43:16.280]  about me committing libel and slander against me going on television and lying about me calling me
[03:43:16.280 --> 03:43:23.560]  things i probably would have gone full dictator and thrown them all into gulag and trump just
[03:43:23.560 --> 03:43:31.880]  lets him do it he just lets him do it he doesn't even address it he just goes on and keeps fighting
[03:43:31.880 --> 03:43:41.960]  his battles somehow just ignores it all and it all hit me when i was watching that clip from darin
[03:43:41.960 --> 03:43:50.360]  mcgreen folks they're just trying to gaslight him that's all they're trying to do
[03:43:54.040 --> 03:44:00.120]  they really this is all they're trying to do is to tick him off that's all they're trying to do
[03:44:00.120 --> 03:44:03.960]  they're trying to instigate him they're trying to poke him and poke him and poke him and poke him
[03:44:03.960 --> 03:44:07.800]  and poke him and poke him and poke him and poke him until he actually acts against them
[03:44:08.680 --> 03:44:13.400]  until he actually moves against them and then they'll claim he's a dictator then they'll claim
[03:44:13.400 --> 03:44:21.080]  he's a tyrant then they'll claim he's an authoritarian oh my gosh oh my gosh
[03:44:21.080 --> 03:44:26.760]  These people are such scum.
[03:44:26.760 --> 03:44:29.920]  These people are such scum.
[03:44:29.920 --> 03:44:31.920]  They hate this country so much.
[03:44:31.920 --> 03:44:33.600]  They hate America so much.
[03:44:33.600 --> 03:44:38.880]  They hate Trump so much that they're going to sit around all day long and instead of
[03:44:38.880 --> 03:44:43.560]  covering news, they're going to gaslight President Trump.
[03:44:43.560 --> 03:44:46.880]  Oh my gosh, what is this?
[03:44:46.880 --> 03:44:48.080]  Pull that article back up.
[03:44:48.080 --> 03:44:49.080]  What was that story?
[03:44:49.080 --> 03:44:51.760]  The first gaslighting of President Trump.
[03:44:51.760 --> 03:44:54.640]  This is from the New York Times.
[03:44:54.640 --> 03:44:57.840]  They're admitting their plan.
[03:44:57.840 --> 03:44:59.840]  They're admitting their plan.
[03:44:59.840 --> 03:45:00.840]  That's all this is.
[03:45:00.840 --> 03:45:02.240]  They're all gaslighting him.
[03:45:02.240 --> 03:45:05.200]  They're all teaming up to gaslight him.
[03:45:05.200 --> 03:45:07.600]  And Trump isn't falling for it.
[03:45:07.600 --> 03:45:08.600]  Wow.
[03:45:08.600 --> 03:45:11.040]  Folks, they're doing the same thing in the streets to Trump supporters.
[03:45:11.040 --> 03:45:14.360]  They're trying to gaslight all of us and it honestly, it works on me.
[03:45:14.360 --> 03:45:19.040]  I'm literally up here fuming blood boiling because they want to take our country down.
[03:45:19.040 --> 03:45:24.960]  They're not letting us, I mean.
[03:45:24.960 --> 03:45:33.120]  This is like the NBA telling LeBron James that he has to play in concrete shoes.
[03:45:33.120 --> 03:45:37.960]  So then LeBron has to go out there and play in concrete shoes, clearly can't compete with
[03:45:37.960 --> 03:45:39.040]  the rest of them.
[03:45:39.040 --> 03:45:41.720]  And then they're like, look at LeBron, he's so slow.
[03:45:41.720 --> 03:45:44.640]  He sucks.
[03:45:44.640 --> 03:45:51.160]  And to gaslight him, wow.
[03:45:51.160 --> 03:45:53.240]  That really all just hit me with that clip.
[03:45:53.240 --> 03:45:56.400]  Let's go to Robert in California.
[03:45:56.400 --> 03:45:59.480]  Go ahead, Robert.
[03:45:59.480 --> 03:46:08.040]  President, the president said that he was going to investigate everybody or investigate
[03:46:08.040 --> 03:46:09.040]  the issue.
[03:46:09.040 --> 03:46:15.240]  If he investigates it, he's going to find out the same thing that we've known forever.
[03:46:15.240 --> 03:46:20.640]  And Tiva and Black Lives Matter are all ran by George Soros and it's a good possibility
[03:46:20.640 --> 03:46:25.600]  he's going to run them up as a domestic terrorist group.
[03:46:25.600 --> 03:46:30.000]  That's why he didn't name them because he wants to wait for the investigation first.
[03:46:30.000 --> 03:46:31.000]  I think you're right.
[03:46:31.000 --> 03:46:34.840]  And I think he's also been waiting for the mainstream media to glorify them.
[03:46:34.840 --> 03:46:35.920]  I think that you're right.
[03:46:35.920 --> 03:46:40.160]  Some people, they don't think that any brinkmanship ever goes on.
[03:46:40.160 --> 03:46:48.520]  But it's funny because look at the mainstream media where you have, for the last eight months,
[03:46:48.520 --> 03:46:50.960]  let's just look at the year 2017.
[03:46:50.960 --> 03:46:53.320]  Let's just look at 2017.
[03:46:53.320 --> 03:47:01.380]  For the last eight months, how much media coverage have you seen demonizing Antifa outside
[03:47:01.380 --> 03:47:04.160]  of a select few Fox News programs?
[03:47:04.160 --> 03:47:05.160]  Zero.
[03:47:05.160 --> 03:47:11.800]  How many news programs have you seen on mainstream cable television demonizing Black Lives Matter
[03:47:11.800 --> 03:47:16.000]  violence outside of a few Fox programs?
[03:47:16.000 --> 03:47:19.080]  Zero.
[03:47:19.080 --> 03:47:26.120]  How many times have you seen cable television news cover liberal political assassination
[03:47:26.120 --> 03:47:27.120]  attempts?
[03:47:27.120 --> 03:47:32.640]  Hodgkinson on Steve's Glees and other members of the Republican Party, Clayton Carter on
[03:47:32.640 --> 03:47:39.000]  his neighbor for being a Trump supporter and he's a Trump hater, zero.
[03:47:39.000 --> 03:47:43.320]  You don't even see that on Fox News hardly.
[03:47:43.320 --> 03:47:52.080]  But what do you know, a staged event, a completely staged event that can be used to demonize
[03:47:52.080 --> 03:48:02.600]  Trump supporters, they all cover that, every single one of them, all weekend long.
[03:48:02.600 --> 03:48:03.800]  All day long.
[03:48:03.800 --> 03:48:07.120]  And then they tell you that Trump hasn't disavowed it, even though he's already done
[03:48:07.120 --> 03:48:10.240]  it multiple times.
[03:48:10.240 --> 03:48:19.080]  And all it is, is an attempt to gaslight us into civil war.
[03:48:19.080 --> 03:48:23.960]  I just prayed to God, I just prayed to God that justice befell these people on earth.
[03:48:23.960 --> 03:48:29.440]  Because they're going to, they're going to, they're going to just ruin the planet earth
[03:48:29.440 --> 03:48:31.280]  before they go to hell.
[03:48:31.280 --> 03:48:33.320]  Go ahead Robert, finish up your points.
[03:48:33.320 --> 03:48:37.000]  Yeah, I'd like to really see president on Gab.
[03:48:37.000 --> 03:48:41.840]  That's where his honest base is, uh, Gab was meant for that.
[03:48:41.840 --> 03:48:46.800]  He can be on Twitter and Gab, but at least he's going to get not censored on Gab.
[03:48:46.800 --> 03:48:49.520]  Yeah, and here's the thing too, you can link your Gab to your Twitter.
[03:48:49.520 --> 03:48:55.360]  I said this a while ago, President Trump could literally change the game overnight if he
[03:48:55.360 --> 03:49:01.680]  got off Twitter and got on Gab, because all of a sudden Twitter doesn't control that social
[03:49:01.680 --> 03:49:04.080]  media landscape anymore.
[03:49:04.080 --> 03:49:10.840]  All of a sudden the mainstream news has to cover Gab, because Trump gets on Gab.
[03:49:10.840 --> 03:49:12.320]  That's how that works.
[03:49:12.320 --> 03:49:15.280]  I don't know if Trump has ever thought of that, even knows of Gab, or if that's anything
[03:49:15.280 --> 03:49:17.680]  on his radar, but yeah, I made that point too.
[03:49:17.680 --> 03:49:18.680]  It's a great point.
[03:49:18.680 --> 03:49:20.120]  Let's squeeze in Rick from Illinois.
[03:49:20.120 --> 03:49:21.640]  Rick, real quick, you got 60 seconds.
[03:49:21.640 --> 03:49:22.640]  Go ahead.
[03:49:22.640 --> 03:49:25.440]  All right, first of all, can you hear me okay?
[03:49:25.440 --> 03:49:26.440]  Yep, go ahead.
[03:49:26.440 --> 03:49:27.440]  All right.
[03:49:27.440 --> 03:49:30.680]  I've got a lot of stuff to cover here real quick.
[03:49:30.680 --> 03:49:34.000]  We're talking about Antifa and BLM and all.
[03:49:34.000 --> 03:49:40.000]  First of all, let's take a look at, oh, hold on, let me y'all speak the question.
[03:49:40.000 --> 03:49:44.480]  All right, Rick in Illinois, are you there?
[03:49:44.480 --> 03:49:45.480]  Yeah, I'm here.
[03:49:45.480 --> 03:49:46.480]  Is that better?
[03:49:46.480 --> 03:49:47.480]  Yeah, that's good.
[03:49:47.480 --> 03:49:48.480]  Okay.
[03:49:48.480 --> 03:49:49.480]  Yeah, I had you on speaker.
[03:49:49.480 --> 03:49:50.480]  Let me get you off real quick.
[03:49:50.480 --> 03:49:51.480]  I got you.
[03:49:51.480 --> 03:49:53.920]  You're talking about Antifa and the Black Lives Matter movement.
[03:49:53.920 --> 03:49:57.360]  This is going to take me about five minutes to cover all of this because I do research
[03:49:57.360 --> 03:49:58.360]  like you guys do.
[03:49:58.360 --> 03:50:01.480]  I run my own website like you guys do.
[03:50:01.480 --> 03:50:06.080]  If the BLM and Antifa want to, and nobody's touched on this yet, if they want to insist
[03:50:06.080 --> 03:50:12.240]  on trying to erase our history, taking down the Civil War heroes or non-heroes, the Civil
[03:50:12.240 --> 03:50:17.800]  War statues, they need to take all of their currency out of their pockets and burn it.
[03:50:17.800 --> 03:50:22.000]  It's most every president on all of our currency was a slave owner.
[03:50:22.000 --> 03:50:23.000]  Well, it's all lies.
[03:50:23.000 --> 03:50:26.160]  We'll hold you over for the next segment, Rick, but it's all based on lies anyway.
[03:50:26.160 --> 03:50:27.400]  I mean, that's the whole point.
[03:50:27.400 --> 03:50:29.360]  I guarantee you, we're going to prove this.
[03:50:29.360 --> 03:50:31.760]  They don't even know who Robert E. Lee is.
[03:50:31.760 --> 03:50:33.240]  You can ask them a question about Robert E. Lee.
[03:50:33.240 --> 03:50:34.240]  They won't even know.
[03:50:34.240 --> 03:50:39.200]  Like the fact that President Lincoln actually thought Robert E. Lee was a hero.
[03:50:39.200 --> 03:50:41.280]  Robert E. Lee didn't even want statues, folks.
[03:50:41.280 --> 03:50:43.600]  He didn't even want the statues.
[03:50:43.600 --> 03:50:44.600]  But they don't read history.
[03:50:44.600 --> 03:51:12.360]  He's never even read a book.

[03:53:46.120 --> 03:53:57.440]  So now the Anne Frank Center on Twitter that spouts fake news and lies about Trump all
[03:53:57.440 --> 03:54:01.920]  day long once Trump's Twitter account suspended, well, maybe your Twitter account should be
[03:54:01.920 --> 03:54:02.920]  suspended.
[03:54:02.920 --> 03:54:06.800]  What type of a person, no, no, no, seriously, think about this analogy.
[03:54:06.800 --> 03:54:12.240]  What type of a person tries to agitate you, tries to poke you, tries to get a reaction
[03:54:12.240 --> 03:54:14.040]  out of you, just to bother you?
[03:54:14.040 --> 03:54:15.120]  What type of person does that?
[03:54:15.120 --> 03:54:19.920]  A toddler, an immature snot-nosed brat.
[03:54:19.920 --> 03:54:27.400]  And that's what 90% of television news is, just agitators, little P-brained snot-nosed
[03:54:27.400 --> 03:54:33.920]  brats with a little slingshot, just trying to hit you, a little paper bullet, just trying
[03:54:33.920 --> 03:54:37.080]  to get a reaction out of you.
[03:54:37.080 --> 03:54:40.440]  And for the most part, Trump has been sloughing it off.
[03:54:40.440 --> 03:54:43.760]  People are pointing out, well, he fired Flynn, he made this move here, so maybe some of the
[03:54:43.760 --> 03:54:46.000]  gaslighting is working.
[03:54:46.000 --> 03:54:50.400]  Regardless, it's time for Trump to go on the offense and I'm hoping he's priming for that.
[03:54:50.400 --> 03:54:55.880]  Folks, got to remind you before we get off air here, the BuzzFeed special at infowarstore.com.

[03:55:49.240 --> 03:55:51.240]  Rick, go ahead.
[03:55:51.240 --> 03:55:53.320]  Yeah, you're getting ready to get off there.
[03:55:53.320 --> 03:55:57.280]  So let me make a couple key points real quick and then if I can plug my website, which is
[03:55:57.280 --> 03:55:58.280]  just like yours.
[03:55:58.280 --> 03:56:02.080]  I've had it four years and got almost a quarter million hits, but we're talking about money
[03:56:02.080 --> 03:56:04.840]  with the presidents that were slave owners on money.
[03:56:04.840 --> 03:56:09.560]  And then a lot of people don't realize that picnics were in fact used to sit where families
[03:56:09.560 --> 03:56:12.480]  went out and sat on their lawns and watched the civil war fights.
[03:56:12.480 --> 03:56:13.480]  Yeah.
[03:56:13.480 --> 03:56:14.480]  All right.
[03:56:14.480 --> 03:56:18.400]  Not only that, lawn jockeys, a lot of people call lawn jockeys racist, but they don't realize
[03:56:18.400 --> 03:56:22.600]  that lawn jockeys were those little black and white statues that people put in front
[03:56:22.600 --> 03:56:25.320]  of their homes to let them know where they could get quarter at.
[03:56:25.320 --> 03:56:29.880]  And the black lawn jockeys were actually places where the slaves could get quarter at for
[03:56:29.880 --> 03:56:31.280]  the night during the war.
[03:56:31.280 --> 03:56:32.280]  All right.
[03:56:32.280 --> 03:56:33.800]  Now, what's the name of your website?
[03:56:33.800 --> 03:56:36.520]  What's the name of your website?
[03:56:36.520 --> 03:56:39.640]  Conspiracy news, C-O-N-S-F-E-A-R.
[03:56:39.640 --> 03:56:40.640]  Conspiracynews.com.
[03:56:40.640 --> 03:56:42.440]  Now we actually have the story too.
[03:56:42.440 --> 03:56:43.920]  Not conspiracy.
[03:56:43.920 --> 03:56:44.920]  Conspiracy.
[03:56:44.920 --> 03:56:45.920]  Conspiracy.
[03:56:45.920 --> 03:56:48.920]  Conspiracy.
[03:56:48.920 --> 03:56:49.920]  Conspiracy.
[03:56:49.920 --> 03:56:50.920]  Conspiracy.
[03:56:50.920 --> 03:56:51.920]  Conspiracy.
[03:56:51.920 --> 03:56:52.920]  Conspiracy.
[03:56:52.920 --> 03:56:53.920]  Conspiracy.
[03:56:53.920 --> 03:56:55.280]  Now we have the story here, guys.
[03:56:55.280 --> 03:57:00.280]  Pull up the story about Robert E. Lee not wanting his statues up.
[03:57:00.280 --> 03:57:01.720]  You guys said you had that story.
[03:57:01.720 --> 03:57:09.400]  You know, I'm a big fan of the old Western film, Magnificent Seven.
[03:57:09.400 --> 03:57:11.880]  It was one of my favorite movies growing up.
[03:57:11.880 --> 03:57:17.080]  Now they did a remake of this movie with Denzel Washington and Chris Pratt and some
[03:57:17.080 --> 03:57:19.400]  other big name actors.
[03:57:19.400 --> 03:57:20.840]  I think Ethan Hawke was in it too.
[03:57:20.840 --> 03:57:22.720]  I can't remember all of them.
[03:57:22.720 --> 03:57:25.480]  And I watched it for the first time and it was kind of a let down.
[03:57:25.480 --> 03:57:27.120]  I didn't think that they did very well.
[03:57:27.120 --> 03:57:29.080]  I thought that the first one was much better.
[03:57:29.080 --> 03:57:35.000]  I watched it again last night and it actually made me realize how brilliant the brand new
[03:57:35.000 --> 03:57:39.760]  Magnificent Seven is and probably why Denzel Washington took the role.
[03:57:39.760 --> 03:57:45.360]  So the Magnificent Seven is a story about a bunch of lone rangers, a bunch of gunmen
[03:57:45.360 --> 03:57:51.000]  in the Wild Wild West who team up, come together to defeat essentially a tyrant and authoritarian
[03:57:51.000 --> 03:57:52.840]  over this neighborhood.
[03:57:52.840 --> 03:57:56.240]  And in the original, it's just a bunch of white guys, just a great old Western flick.
[03:57:56.240 --> 03:57:59.920]  In the new one, they've put an angle out there.
[03:57:59.920 --> 03:58:03.080]  The leader of the clan, Denzel Washington, is a black man.
[03:58:03.080 --> 03:58:10.080]  So in his group of people is a leading Confederate soldier who had confirmed 23 kills.
[03:58:10.080 --> 03:58:11.320]  They work together.
[03:58:11.320 --> 03:58:16.240]  Also in the group is a Native American Indian and an old American who came from Europe who
[03:58:16.240 --> 03:58:17.240]  hates Indians.
[03:58:17.240 --> 03:58:19.000]  But they all work together.
[03:58:19.000 --> 03:58:25.280]  They're all on the same team to defeat tyranny, to defeat authoritarianism, to defeat the
[03:58:25.280 --> 03:58:28.040]  foot of someone telling you what to do.
[03:58:28.040 --> 03:58:29.320]  That's what America needs.
[03:58:29.320 --> 03:58:30.320]  We all have to unite.
[03:58:30.320 --> 03:58:37.320]  No matter what our color is, religion is nothing, unite and we will stand.
