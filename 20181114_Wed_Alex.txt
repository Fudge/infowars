[00:00.000 --> 00:22.080]  Defending the Republic from enemies born and domestic, it's Alex Jones.
[00:22.080 --> 00:28.840]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Wednesday, November 14, 2018.
[00:28.840 --> 00:29.840]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:29.840 --> 00:33.400]  We're going to be here for the next four hours.
[00:33.400 --> 00:39.760]  And you know, I talked about taking the broadcast in a new direction, and it's something I've
[00:39.760 --> 00:41.360]  been planning to do for a long time.
[00:41.360 --> 00:49.160]  It really has nothing to do with the Republicans having the midterm election stolen from them,
[00:49.160 --> 00:51.640]  the American people being robbed.
[00:51.640 --> 00:56.960]  It's something I've known for a long time, studying how the globalists attack info wars
[00:56.960 --> 01:03.080]  and what they specifically are afraid of.
[01:03.080 --> 01:11.160]  Gives us really a heads up display of not just when we're over the target, but the architecture
[01:11.160 --> 01:15.280]  of what they're building and what they're planning to construct.
[01:15.280 --> 01:24.280]  Now not hard to do this when you understand that they established over 100 years ago,
[01:24.280 --> 01:35.360]  150 years ago or so, royal societies of writing in France and in England and in Austria, Hungary
[01:35.360 --> 01:46.360]  and the Empire, Germany, to control the public mind and the future and shape the shape of
[01:46.360 --> 01:48.360]  things to come.
[01:48.360 --> 01:51.640]  And they were quite honest about it.
[01:51.640 --> 02:00.880]  So some would call that predictive programming, but it's a little bit beyond that.
[02:00.880 --> 02:05.480]  And so in that, there's a lot of different ways to attack this.
[02:05.480 --> 02:11.320]  Instead of me just up here, like an emergency beacon, rattling off all the horrible things
[02:11.320 --> 02:15.440]  the globalists are doing constantly, which I'll still do.
[02:15.440 --> 02:22.520]  Really what they're afraid of is us putting together things like books that really lay
[02:22.520 --> 02:28.640]  it all out in consensual order to then give that to members of Congress.
[02:28.640 --> 02:34.880]  They're really worried about intellectual targeting of the ruling class itself because
[02:34.880 --> 02:37.600]  most of the ruling class doesn't even know what they're involved in either.
[02:37.600 --> 02:43.960]  If they did, they would be pulling out real fast, which you start seeing them doing.
[02:43.960 --> 02:49.640]  Trump and Elon Musk and Bill Joy and many, many others are like, no, you, you go to
[02:49.640 --> 02:54.280]  these globalist conferences and all they talk about is how they're going to end humanity
[02:54.280 --> 02:57.000]  for some AI God.
[02:57.000 --> 03:01.280]  I put that in my film in game 11 years ago, then the New York Times made fun of it.
[03:01.280 --> 03:06.400]  I was quoting top globalists at the UN.
[03:06.400 --> 03:08.800]  They've got a plan, okay?
[03:08.800 --> 03:12.440]  And it's not my opinion.
[03:12.440 --> 03:18.360]  And if people just understand, we're under attack for certain things we cover here that
[03:18.360 --> 03:21.200]  nobody else does.
[03:21.200 --> 03:28.040]  And so all I'm saying is we need to drill into those things every day in depth because
[03:28.040 --> 03:34.080]  there's a spectrum of things, 15 things or so really, I was thinking about this morning,
[03:34.080 --> 03:38.680]  15, 20, but you can even pair it down to five or six things and then there's subgroups
[03:38.680 --> 03:39.680]  to those.
[03:39.680 --> 03:42.000]  But we've got the enemy's number.
[03:42.000 --> 03:43.160]  We know their plan.
[03:43.160 --> 03:44.760]  We know their dreams.
[03:44.760 --> 03:53.080]  We know where they want to take us and they believe it's off world.
[03:53.080 --> 04:00.480]  They believe they're getting divine messages from their God that's going to give them
[04:00.480 --> 04:03.720]  eternal life if they kill everybody.
[04:03.720 --> 04:07.080]  Now, that's not me saying it.
[04:07.080 --> 04:08.080]  That's what they're doing.
[04:08.080 --> 04:12.000]  And you notice in their attacks and criticism of me, they never touched that even though
[04:12.000 --> 04:14.520]  that sounds pretty discrediting when I'm saying, right?
[04:14.520 --> 04:16.320]  Why don't they go there?
[04:16.320 --> 04:20.480]  Because ladies and gentlemen, we know their religion.
[04:20.480 --> 04:25.680]  Oh, and it's just exactly what you read in the Bible about the devil who comes to kill,
[04:25.680 --> 04:28.480]  steal, and destroy it is falling to the planet.
[04:28.480 --> 04:30.000]  It's fallen to the planet.
[04:30.000 --> 04:31.000]  It doesn't like us.
[04:31.000 --> 04:35.520]  It wants to kill us, but it doesn't have the power dimensionally.
[04:35.520 --> 04:36.800]  It's got to get us to do it.
[04:36.800 --> 04:42.320]  It's got to get us to build it, to build our own guillotine.
[04:42.320 --> 04:47.040]  But it also wants to tear our guts out slowly once it gets full control.
[04:47.040 --> 04:52.040]  So remember, everything that you see is an evil fallen force off world that wants to
[04:52.040 --> 04:53.040]  kill you and your family.
[04:53.040 --> 05:00.720]  But it wants to suck your soul first and torture the living hell out of you.
[05:00.720 --> 05:03.000]  Fueling your body is hard work.
[05:03.000 --> 05:07.520]  That's why we've introduced the InfoWars Life Daily Digestive Pack to help you fuel
[05:07.520 --> 05:08.680]  it right.

[06:25.360 --> 06:32.360]  You have freedom of choice, you don't, you have no choice, you have owners, they own
[06:32.360 --> 06:39.280]  you, they own everything, they own all the important land, they own and control the corporations
[06:39.280 --> 06:42.760]  that long since bought and paid for the senate, the congress, the state houses and city halls
[06:42.760 --> 06:46.320]  they got the judges in their back pockets and they own all the big media companies
[06:46.320 --> 06:49.760]  so they control just about all the news and information you get to hear.
[06:49.760 --> 06:52.920]  They got you by the balls.
[06:52.920 --> 06:58.880]  They want obedient workers, obedient workers, people who are just smart enough to run the
[06:58.880 --> 07:03.800]  machines and do the paperwork and just dumb enough to passively accept jobs with the lower
[07:03.800 --> 07:08.240]  pay, the longer hours, the reduced benefits, the end of overtime and the vanishing pension
[07:08.240 --> 07:12.200]  that disappears the minute you go to collect it and now they're coming for your social
[07:12.200 --> 07:17.840]  security money so they can give it to their criminal friends on Wall Street.
[07:17.840 --> 07:21.200]  It's a big club and you ain't in it.
[07:21.200 --> 07:24.200]  You and I are not in the big club.
[07:24.200 --> 07:28.880]  The owners of this country know the truth, it's called the American dream because you
[07:28.880 --> 07:31.960]  have to be asleep to believe it.
[07:31.960 --> 07:36.360]  But I'll tell you what they don't want, they don't want a population of citizens capable
[07:36.360 --> 07:40.440]  of critical thinking, they don't want well informed, well educated people capable of
[07:40.440 --> 07:44.440]  critical thinking, they're not interested in that, that doesn't help them, that's against
[07:44.440 --> 07:51.440]  their interest, that's right.
[07:51.440 --> 08:10.440]  There is a lot of controversy around this network about Alex Shulman for example.
[08:10.440 --> 08:21.440]  Alex Jones, the foray conspiracy theorist who was a parent.
[08:21.440 --> 08:22.440]  Alex Jones.
[08:22.440 --> 08:23.440]  Scum, Russian scum.
[08:23.440 --> 08:24.440]  Until war comes to mind.
[08:24.440 --> 08:25.440]  Reputation is amazing.
[08:25.440 --> 08:26.440]  I will not let you down.
[08:26.440 --> 08:27.440]  You will be buried.
[08:27.440 --> 08:28.440]  I will not let you down.
[08:28.440 --> 08:29.440]  I will not let you down.
[08:29.440 --> 08:30.440]  I will not let you down.
[08:30.440 --> 08:31.440]  I will not let you down.
[08:31.440 --> 08:41.440]  I will not let you down.
[08:41.440 --> 09:01.780]  I am impressed, I hope.
[09:01.780 --> 09:09.920]  We know the Democrats are just part of a international nation killing crime syndicate and we know
[09:09.920 --> 09:17.720]  their operating system and their sworn mission is to destroy the United States of America
[09:17.720 --> 09:23.440]  and to destroy what's left of Europe and the UK, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, any
[09:23.440 --> 09:29.800]  other nation that has any history of a middle class or any history of contending for global
[09:29.800 --> 09:30.800]  power.
[09:30.800 --> 09:41.720]  We are in the middle of a 21st century imperial corporate war allied with the most murderous
[09:41.720 --> 09:49.920]  regimes the planet has ever seen using the decadence and the leftist rot in the West
[09:49.920 --> 09:58.560]  have our own people cheerlead our destruction.
[09:58.560 --> 10:00.240]  Think about it.
[10:00.240 --> 10:06.520]  It was 40 years ago that the council on final relations started publicly saying we are going
[10:06.520 --> 10:11.120]  to get rid of the nation state, we are going to get rid of the family, we are going to
[10:11.120 --> 10:17.440]  get rid of everything that is identifiable of any form of individualism and we are going
[10:17.440 --> 10:26.880]  to have giant dumb down populations of programmable slaves on the path towards phasing 80% of
[10:26.880 --> 10:29.880]  the world population out.
[10:29.880 --> 10:33.200]  Now that's general consumption.
[10:33.200 --> 10:38.760]  When you get the higher level documents that are public they talk about 98% of world population
[10:38.760 --> 10:39.760]  reduction.
[10:39.760 --> 10:45.760]  But you always tell the college professor class oh we are just going to get rid of 80%,
[10:45.760 --> 10:49.040]  it's for the earth, it's for everyone's best interest and even if that was true in the
[10:49.040 --> 10:53.200]  case which it isn't, they are not doing it to save the earth ladies and gentlemen they
[10:53.200 --> 10:57.040]  are doing it for total power.
[10:57.040 --> 11:01.840]  They are going to use the third world populations before they kill them to overrun and bring
[11:01.840 --> 11:12.320]  down the West so the West will then be complicit in the first phase of extermination.
[11:12.320 --> 11:20.120]  Now it's this topic and a few other key ones that tie into it that we cover on air that
[11:20.120 --> 11:24.320]  the globalists want off the air.
[11:24.320 --> 11:31.360]  They do not want this discussed, they do not want to have a debate about this, they just
[11:31.360 --> 11:35.760]  want to pre-program everybody through television and movies so that when you hear it you go
[11:35.760 --> 11:40.680]  oh that's in a movie, oh that's in a movie that came out last year, that's on the Netflix
[11:40.680 --> 11:41.680]  show.
[11:41.680 --> 11:48.600]  Yeah, they have been pre-programming you for a long, long time to not be able to differentiate
[11:48.600 --> 11:55.080]  fact from fiction so that your brain is accustomed to these horrific ideas but doesn't take it
[11:55.080 --> 11:56.580]  as serious.
[11:56.580 --> 12:01.880]  It goes into a fiction bank in your brain where you are then desensitized to the real
[12:01.880 --> 12:11.560]  thing and can't then react because you're under a form of hypnotic programming or suggestion
[12:11.560 --> 12:15.760]  because you've watched hundreds of thousands of simulated murders.
[12:15.760 --> 12:23.000]  You have watched countless action of sex with other people but it's not really you and all
[12:23.000 --> 12:28.560]  of this doesn't increase sex, it doesn't increase IQ, it doesn't increase having a good life,
[12:28.560 --> 12:38.920]  it actually reduces your life to where you now become the fiction and the fiction becomes
[12:38.920 --> 12:41.040]  the reality.
[12:41.040 --> 12:43.920]  That's the alchemy, that's the fantasy land.
[12:43.920 --> 12:49.560]  So I have a whole bunch of really important things we're going to cover today that we're
[12:49.560 --> 13:00.360]  going to get into all of it but it's just important to understand that nationalists that
[13:00.360 --> 13:06.480]  are getting elected around the world are the response to people discovering that their
[13:06.480 --> 13:12.760]  countries are run by offshore unelected criminal combats and that's the beginning of being
[13:12.760 --> 13:20.480]  able to turn this around and it doesn't mean there's some perfect utopia that we're offering,
[13:20.480 --> 13:25.200]  it means that at least we will not have people in power that are directing an anti-human
[13:25.200 --> 13:37.840]  phase, a post-human world because that currently is the global order and is the global standardized
[13:37.840 --> 13:51.160]  plan that is 100% dedicated to scientific evil, scientific tyranny where the science
[13:51.160 --> 13:56.160]  of tyranny is law.
[13:56.160 --> 14:04.880]  Now we've got a lot of big news obviously and we're going to go through all of it and
[14:04.880 --> 14:16.240]  the big story that I'm going to cover when we come back could not be more paramount to
[14:16.240 --> 14:27.800]  saving this country and stopping the globalist mad rush to completely convert this country
[14:27.800 --> 14:31.760]  into an authoritarian state to stop the populist awakening.
[14:31.760 --> 14:38.200]  You hear a lot about martial law here on this show and civil unrest and things and now you
[14:38.200 --> 14:39.480]  see that in the mainstream news.
[14:39.480 --> 14:43.840]  The new talking point is that Trump is going to call the military out and refuse to leave
[14:43.840 --> 14:47.160]  office.
[14:47.160 --> 14:51.440]  That's because they're planning to stage a civil emergency and then if Trump responds
[14:51.440 --> 14:57.480]  to it properly they're going to call it a form of dictatorial martial law when they
[14:57.480 --> 15:01.520]  are the ones that have already triggered it and I've told you this is coming, now they're
[15:01.520 --> 15:06.600]  coming out with the talking points and just like night follows day and day follows night
[15:06.600 --> 15:12.680]  and just like major league Republican leaders are coming out and saying the Democrats are
[15:12.680 --> 15:18.560]  stealing the 2018 election, they're now in eight, nine days into it, it's incredible
[15:18.560 --> 15:24.560]  and it's a dry run for 2020.
[15:24.560 --> 15:29.040]  It's a dry run for Hillary now saying oh I am going to run.
[15:29.040 --> 15:33.040]  Two weeks ago she said she wouldn't because she knew that's unpopular for her to run
[15:33.040 --> 15:37.000]  so she said oh I'm not going to run but now that she sees the weakness of the Republican
[15:37.000 --> 15:44.640]  leadership now that she sees them doing nothing to the public theft in Arizona, California
[15:44.640 --> 15:53.240]  and Florida this has green lit them to now go into more overdrive than you can ever possibly
[15:53.240 --> 15:54.240]  imagine.
[15:54.240 --> 15:59.240]  You think the globalists have already gone crazy, get ready you ain't seen nothing yet.
[15:59.240 --> 16:04.600]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of
[16:04.600 --> 16:05.600]  the world.
[16:05.600 --> 16:08.640]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[16:08.640 --> 16:14.600]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[16:14.600 --> 16:18.400]  Its former colony the US had to save the empire.
[16:18.400 --> 16:19.400]  Was there ever a vote?
[16:19.400 --> 16:20.960]  Who do we fight for?
[16:20.960 --> 16:23.880]  The deep state began with World War I.
[16:23.880 --> 16:28.880]  The United States of Empire by James Dunn available at Amazon books.
[16:28.880 --> 16:33.040]  What if there was a social media network only for the conservative?
[16:33.040 --> 16:37.040]  What if there was a social media network not only for the conservative right general public
[16:37.040 --> 16:40.360]  but also a platform for conservative politicians and advertisers?
[16:40.360 --> 16:45.280]  And what if the social media network was the only free speech network in existence?
[16:45.280 --> 16:46.280]  There is.
[16:46.280 --> 16:47.280]  It's rightsocial.net.
[16:47.280 --> 16:48.280]  Rightsocial.net.
[16:48.280 --> 16:52.440]  A response to President Donald Trump's direct presidential order.
[16:52.440 --> 16:55.960]  Rightsocial.net where you have the right to freely speak your mind.
[16:55.960 --> 16:56.960]  Rightsocial.net.
[16:56.960 --> 16:58.960]  The right place to be.
[16:58.960 --> 17:02.880]  In these uncertain times it makes sense to have a sustainable backup method to cook
[17:02.880 --> 17:04.080]  food and boil water.
[17:04.080 --> 17:08.360]  If your current plan includes using a fuel burning stove or cooking over an open fire
[17:08.360 --> 17:09.960]  then there's a much better way.
[17:09.960 --> 17:14.800]  The Minuteman rocket stove is a biomass burning cooking stove that only requires small quantities
[17:14.800 --> 17:16.440]  of sticks and twigs for fuel.
[17:16.440 --> 17:20.640]  The Minuteman stove is easy to use, smokeless, portable, powerful and sustainable for the
[17:20.640 --> 17:25.120]  finest in survival cooking stoves and fire starters made right here in the USA.

[17:28.920 --> 17:29.920]  Hear that?
[17:29.920 --> 17:35.600]  That's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransacked the place.
[17:35.600 --> 17:39.200]  And what they don't steal will be destroyed.

[17:54.840 --> 18:23.680]  Be vigilant but not fearful, faketv.com.
[18:23.680 --> 18:27.600]  Ancient Mayan knowledge is paired with the natural fertility of the land to generate

[18:29.600 --> 18:34.800]  Carefully harvested and free of toxic chemicals used in big agricultural productions, Patriot

[19:00.360 --> 19:04.760]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years
[19:04.760 --> 19:09.480]  of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature
[19:09.480 --> 19:11.000]  to detoxify the body.
[19:11.000 --> 19:15.880]  That's why I'm introducing ZShield, Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[19:15.880 --> 19:17.400]  It's made in the USA.
[19:17.400 --> 19:22.320]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying
[19:22.320 --> 19:24.120]  the body and it supports the info war.
[19:24.120 --> 19:26.400]  It is a classical 360 win.
[19:26.400 --> 19:30.880]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year and now we believe
[19:30.880 --> 19:35.560]  we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly
[19:35.560 --> 19:36.560]  get.
[19:36.560 --> 19:39.760]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family and you owe it to the future of this
[19:39.760 --> 19:44.800]  country and the world that Patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you
[19:44.800 --> 19:50.040]  can be because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires the
[19:50.040 --> 19:53.880]  next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be thanks to your support and your
[19:53.880 --> 19:54.880]  prayers together.
[19:54.880 --> 19:55.880]  We're changing the world.
[19:55.880 --> 20:03.480]  Now it's time to change our bodies with ZShield and infowarstore.com.
[20:03.480 --> 20:19.480]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:19.480 --> 20:29.200]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[20:29.200 --> 20:35.280]  I intend to stay on the air as long as I possibly can whether that be a year, 10 years, 20 years
[20:35.280 --> 20:42.320]  to continue to try to promote freedom and a future for my children and I know a lot
[20:42.320 --> 20:47.720]  of you hope you can stay on there as well but there are concerted continual efforts
[20:47.720 --> 20:54.040]  that are quite visible but also many that are not visible unless you're myself or some
[20:54.040 --> 21:01.280]  of the crew here or my family that really do show us the shape of things to come and
[21:01.280 --> 21:03.760]  I'm not even worried about info wars.
[21:03.760 --> 21:15.120]  All of my concern is with the fact that it's all going to be implemented against you and
[21:15.120 --> 21:19.480]  there's no amount of submission that you can engage in that will ever have the globalist
[21:19.480 --> 21:21.120]  leave you alone.
[21:21.120 --> 21:26.760]  Submit to make you submit, submit, submit, submit by successful approximation by incrementalism
[21:26.760 --> 21:35.920]  until you are completely spiritually bankrupt and accept absolute pure evil.
[21:35.920 --> 21:43.480]  You have to be maneuvered to use your free will to cut yourself off from God and that's
[21:43.480 --> 21:53.920]  the bonanza, that's the gold ring, the brass ring, that's the ruby in the idol's forehead.
[21:53.920 --> 22:01.560]  That's where this train goes.
[22:01.560 --> 22:09.600]  And I'm going to get into some of that how they plan to destroy info wars in the next
[22:09.600 --> 22:15.520]  segment because that's how they plan to destroy you but first let me just get to this piece
[22:15.520 --> 22:17.840]  of video.
[22:17.840 --> 22:24.000]  This is one of the new talking points that they've been beta testing in newspapers for
[22:24.000 --> 22:29.320]  the last year and a half but now it's going live on television multiple places.
[22:29.320 --> 22:38.800]  Donnie Deutsch who is a true flesh puppet, mouth of Sauron, says Trump will stage military
[22:38.800 --> 22:43.760]  coup to stay in power in 2020.
[22:43.760 --> 22:46.760]  So they're already saying his presidency is illegitimate, he's a Russian agent when
[22:46.760 --> 22:50.680]  it's the opposite and they say it's great to question elections except when there's total
[22:50.680 --> 22:56.680]  proof of Democrats stealing them and so because Trump is questioning the open theft where
[22:56.680 --> 23:03.720]  they just keep finding magic trucks full of ballots in Florida and California and Arizona
[23:03.720 --> 23:11.200]  and they say a federal judge is set to overturn the election in Georgia, they're making their
[23:11.200 --> 23:12.520]  move.
[23:12.520 --> 23:18.480]  And so they know that when you're faced with massive organized crime working with the EU,
[23:18.480 --> 23:23.120]  working with Communist China to quote stop the nationalist revolution, I mean they say
[23:23.120 --> 23:27.240]  that in the financial times of London, they say that at Davos because they're talking
[23:27.240 --> 23:31.480]  to elites when they're in the financial times where they have headlines like and now for
[23:31.480 --> 23:36.760]  world government, from the editor about how good world government is, how bad nation states
[23:36.760 --> 23:37.760]  are.
[23:37.760 --> 23:43.560]  Remember I was the cook saying that 23 years ago that this was coming and now it's here.
[23:43.560 --> 23:47.000]  Just like everything else we said has come true because it's an agenda, it's a program,
[23:47.000 --> 23:50.520]  I'm not that smart, that's what's frustrating, these are the bad guys, they're blueprints
[23:50.520 --> 23:56.400]  are public and if you don't like their blueprints so far, you might want to find out what the
[23:56.400 --> 24:01.800]  upper floors that are going to be built turn into because let me tell you, it gets worse
[24:01.800 --> 24:07.040]  every floor because these floors go down.
[24:07.040 --> 24:11.840]  So I don't want to just sit up here and rattle this off to people, want people to understand
[24:11.840 --> 24:12.840]  something.
[24:12.840 --> 24:21.440]  The globalists want this off the air because it's the truth.
[24:21.440 --> 24:25.920]  They are trying to remove nationalist and patriots that don't want to be ruled by foreign
[24:25.920 --> 24:34.360]  offshore shadowy banks allied with the chai comms and they are preparing the civil unrest
[24:34.360 --> 24:42.440]  and the terrorism and the false flags and the events to bring all that into fruition.
[24:42.440 --> 24:48.200]  Now they clearly stole the 2018 election and are still ongoing stealing it, it's the most
[24:48.200 --> 24:51.200]  transparent election theft and organized crime we've ever seen.
[24:51.200 --> 24:56.560]  I'm not going to rattle off all of it, we're going to cover it later, but you've seen it.
[24:56.560 --> 25:02.520]  Fake ballots being counted, law being broken, trucks showing up five days after out of nowhere
[25:02.520 --> 25:08.600]  and hauling them in, the governor says impound those under law, Broward County just ignores
[25:08.600 --> 25:13.640]  it, the state police say we're standing down because something might happen to the state
[25:13.640 --> 25:18.200]  police if they actually stood up for America and Florida.
[25:18.200 --> 25:21.600]  All that drug money they've been laundering and all that money they've been keeping while
[25:21.600 --> 25:26.000]  a lot of the state police in Florida are on the take and what if they do something about
[25:26.000 --> 25:31.720]  Broward County, well some of their corruption might come out, see how it works?
[25:31.720 --> 25:38.800]  So you get Trump in there who fires all the lobbyists and actually tries to turn the country
[25:38.800 --> 25:45.280]  back on, he cranks the engine and actually comes back to life, they can't allow that.
[25:45.280 --> 25:51.120]  So Steve Watson has the article, latest crazy leftist conspiracy theory, Trump will stage
[25:51.120 --> 25:53.960]  military coup to stay in power.
[25:53.960 --> 26:02.840]  He would be a president going, I'm not leaving, call the military.
[26:02.840 --> 26:06.480]  Think about that, we'll play the clip when we come back and I'll get more into this but
[26:06.480 --> 26:13.400]  I'm not here to cover what Mr. Deutsch is doing, I'm here to explain what that talking point
[26:13.400 --> 26:21.240]  is and why and how we thread the needle and get out of this.
[26:21.240 --> 26:26.800]  There's a couple different ways to do it and you know, I just have a responsibility to
[26:26.800 --> 26:27.800]  say it.
[26:27.800 --> 26:35.120]  We'll come back from Brecoville, there's one sure way to stop them and I think everybody
[26:35.120 --> 26:37.400]  knows what that is.
[26:37.400 --> 26:41.880]  These are not our fellow Americans, these are criminals trained to bring the country down
[26:41.880 --> 26:45.800]  openly funded and run by the most murderous regime on earth.
[26:45.800 --> 26:48.640]  We're fighting for this country's life right now and we have been invaded, we've already
[26:48.640 --> 26:53.800]  basically been conquered, Trump is like an emergency special ops team that parachuted
[26:53.800 --> 26:58.560]  in and is completely surrounded and everybody else that's fighting is surrounded under attack
[26:58.560 --> 27:02.720]  because the average American is in a haze.
[27:02.720 --> 27:05.880]  The average American is in a trance.
[27:05.880 --> 27:09.040]  The average American may not like the left and what's going on but they don't have any
[27:09.040 --> 27:13.760]  idea how really bad this is.
[27:13.760 --> 27:20.840]  So when you're faced with foreign powers and you're faced with collaborators and traders
[27:20.840 --> 27:24.480]  and they're coming for your family and they're coming for your free speech and they're coming
[27:24.480 --> 27:26.960]  for your culture and they have a real hate.
[27:26.960 --> 27:31.240]  It's not like it's some foreign power that's going to bring advanced technology and a better
[27:31.240 --> 27:32.240]  system.
[27:32.240 --> 27:36.000]  I'd welcome it as liberators, it's not.
[27:36.000 --> 27:41.800]  It's the worst criminals the planet's ever seen and if Russia can kick their asses out,
[27:41.800 --> 27:45.160]  we can kick the globalist out as well.
[27:45.160 --> 27:49.600]  And we're going to have to make the top decisions or we're going to let these criminals run
[27:49.600 --> 27:50.600]  over us.
[27:50.600 --> 27:57.520]  And if America wants to run up the life flag and wants to go along with all this and let
[27:57.520 --> 28:02.680]  them teach your kids that they're different sex when they're five years old and put them
[28:02.680 --> 28:03.680]  all on Prozac.
[28:03.680 --> 28:15.200]  I mean if you really want to become Babylon on steroids and if America just wants to basically
[28:15.200 --> 28:17.280]  commit suicide then that's your issue.
[28:17.280 --> 28:23.440]  But I'm on the year and many other people are on the year and Donald Trump is the president
[28:23.440 --> 28:27.000]  because God is giving us one last warning.
[28:27.000 --> 28:33.040]  One last warning, stop what you're doing now, repent, get it back in gear, say no to the
[28:33.040 --> 28:35.560]  evil or you're going to be destroyed.
[28:35.560 --> 28:41.080]  You're going to go into bondage just like God did to Israel many times.
[28:41.080 --> 28:46.640]  Warning after warning, warning after warning, a lot of times they wake up for a while and
[28:46.640 --> 28:52.120]  then they go back to sleep and they go into 100 years, 200 years, 300 years of bondage.
[28:52.120 --> 28:57.360]  We are about to go into absolute bondage that will make the Soviet Union and China look
[28:57.360 --> 29:26.200]  like a cakewalk.
[29:26.200 --> 29:29.040]  Feel the thrill only at slingbow.com.
[29:29.040 --> 29:34.400]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of
[29:34.400 --> 29:35.400]  the world.
[29:35.400 --> 29:38.440]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[29:38.440 --> 29:44.400]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[29:44.400 --> 29:48.200]  Its former colony, the US, had to save the empire.
[29:48.200 --> 29:49.200]  Was there ever a vote?
[29:49.200 --> 29:50.760]  Who do we fight for?
[29:50.760 --> 29:53.680]  The deep state began with World War I.
[29:53.680 --> 30:00.680]  The United States of Empire by James Dunn, available at Amazon Books.
[30:00.680 --> 30:04.600]  Please, whatever you do realize, they were all getting punched drunk to the censorship
[30:04.600 --> 30:08.240]  and you saw 18 Twitter accounts, they say affiliated with Info Wars.
[30:08.240 --> 30:11.960]  Yes, some of them were like little side accounts, they even know we had like Info Wars stores
[30:11.960 --> 30:16.320]  that just showed our products but they just banned them all yesterday in punishment that
[30:16.320 --> 30:20.160]  I be in a Trump rally and be mobbed by all these folks that loved us.
[30:20.160 --> 30:23.720]  Your excitement about America, your excitement about this broadcast is what brought the country
[30:23.720 --> 30:28.520]  and the world back from the brink but the globalists now want to target where the resistance
[30:28.520 --> 30:31.400]  came from so that we're not pesky in the future.
[30:31.400 --> 30:34.480]  I want to be troublesome and pesky.
[30:34.480 --> 30:35.480]  I want to keep going.
[30:35.480 --> 30:40.560]  I want to make them do the ultimate, not just destroy us financially, I want to push all
[30:40.560 --> 30:41.560]  the way.
[30:41.560 --> 30:42.720]  I've committed to do that.
[30:42.720 --> 30:46.560]  I've prayed for that and I've been told that's going to happen but you've got a back
[30:46.560 --> 30:51.520]  ish and I promise you this, I will never falter, I will never waver at the spiritual
[30:51.520 --> 30:56.000]  level, I physically will but I give you my commitment if you financially support us at
[30:56.000 --> 30:59.800]  foreshore.com to give you my absolute total commitment.
[30:59.800 --> 31:04.560]  It's really hard to have the energy at the end of the day to still get to the gym or
[31:04.560 --> 31:08.840]  to go for a run or go to the park or heck even take your dog for a walk.
[31:08.840 --> 31:13.000]  Believe me, I know I spend hours in front of a screen and then hours in front of bright
[31:13.000 --> 31:20.080]  lights every day but thanks to SuperMailVitality at InfowarsStore.com I still have that energy.
[31:20.080 --> 31:24.280]  There's no way I could have the energy at the end of a long day to fight back against
[31:24.280 --> 31:28.480]  the chemicals in the food and water to fight back against the modern day lifestyle with
[31:28.480 --> 31:33.440]  the screen time and the extended hours to still have the stamina and endurance, energy
[31:33.440 --> 31:40.680]  and drive to get to the gym, get to the park and get exercise that you need for your health.
[31:40.680 --> 31:46.000]  To go to InfowarsStore.com and get SuperMailVitality before it's gone, this is actually our last
[31:46.000 --> 31:52.280]  run of SuperMailVitality so I want you to experience SuperMailVitality before it's
[31:52.280 --> 31:53.280]  too late.

[31:59.960 --> 32:04.000]  The globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment
[32:04.000 --> 32:09.240]  from the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromide, you name it, that it lowers IQ, it
[32:09.240 --> 32:14.440]  literally dumps the population down and on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers,
[32:14.440 --> 32:19.040]  the best iodine in the world, we've gone through two permutations.
[32:19.040 --> 32:23.160]  First seaweed-based iodine that was pretty good but hard to source and the globalists
[32:23.160 --> 32:25.120]  tried to block us getting a supply of it.
[32:25.120 --> 32:30.320]  So we discovered deep earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and brought UX2 that's been
[32:30.320 --> 32:31.320]  incredible.
[32:31.320 --> 32:36.320]  Now, due to the establishment trying to block that, we did more research and secured more
[32:36.320 --> 32:41.040]  of the deep earth crystals of nascent iodine but chemists, scientists and others showed
[32:41.040 --> 32:46.040]  us the research that by combining it with three other compounds, two forms of iodine
[32:46.040 --> 32:52.600]  and vitamin C, it supercharges it and makes it even more bioavailable.
[32:52.600 --> 32:55.680]  Ladies and gentlemen, you want to research it, you want to see it, it's an incredible
[32:55.680 --> 32:56.680]  discovery.
[32:56.680 --> 33:14.040]  This is Alex Jones, Alex3, now available at m4slife.com.
[33:14.040 --> 33:44.000]  There is now no doubt.
[33:44.000 --> 33:50.480]  The Democratic Party is just part of the globalist international corporate crime syndicate that
[33:50.480 --> 33:56.840]  is destroying nation-states, destroying families, collapsing the third world, destabilizing
[33:56.840 --> 34:01.920]  Africa, destabilizing the Middle East, removing any good leaders, putting in the very worst
[34:01.920 --> 34:06.120]  to then collapse those systems into us.
[34:06.120 --> 34:09.840]  All the while exempting themselves from the very taxes and regulations that they foist
[34:09.840 --> 34:18.480]  on us while they lecture the middle class, anyone making over $100,000 a year, particularly
[34:18.480 --> 34:23.480]  that they are horrible, greedy, rich criminals.
[34:23.480 --> 34:29.120]  The hypocrisy is beyond hypocrisy because they're not doing the same thing other people
[34:29.120 --> 34:32.680]  are doing, they're criticizing, it's fraud.
[34:32.680 --> 34:35.960]  So let me, let me get right to it.
[34:35.960 --> 34:43.960]  We can get lost in the new leadership in the House and Senate, we can get lost in the word
[34:43.960 --> 34:48.640]  that General Kelly is about to be out, let's look at this new chief of staff, but you heard
[34:48.640 --> 34:50.480]  that weeks ago here.
[34:50.480 --> 34:55.080]  Let's talk about what's really going on.
[34:55.080 --> 35:00.880]  You don't think the average globalist actually cares about Netflix or Captain America.
[35:00.880 --> 35:05.880]  You don't think they actually care about entertainment, no, no, they care about distracting you with
[35:05.880 --> 35:06.880]  it.
[35:06.880 --> 35:16.760]  They care about power, they care about controlling what you think and do like you're a three-year-old
[35:16.760 --> 35:20.600]  and they're an adult and they can run circles around you because you never discover where
[35:20.600 --> 35:27.840]  you are, who you are, and what's really happening.
[35:27.840 --> 35:34.320]  And so if we look at our free speech being stolen, our right to commerce being stolen,
[35:34.320 --> 35:40.080]  the classical systems that communists and fascists and oligarchies and dictators use
[35:40.080 --> 35:48.280]  to annihilate their political competition and then to squeeze the public, even though
[35:48.280 --> 35:56.120]  it makes them less rich in the end, they like to squeeze, they like to exercise the power
[35:56.120 --> 36:04.720]  in evil ways because that's why they sought the power.
[36:04.720 --> 36:11.480]  And it's not even fear that most men and women will not get involved in stopping this, it's
[36:11.480 --> 36:17.800]  that it looks so complex that good people would want to carry out a process that they
[36:17.800 --> 36:23.200]  were sure would fix things and so you get timid about it because you think you might
[36:23.200 --> 36:27.160]  make mistakes or people might get hurt.
[36:27.160 --> 36:31.800]  What matters is intent in the universe and track record.
[36:31.800 --> 36:34.720]  We know what systems work.
[36:34.720 --> 36:36.600]  We know how to build civilization.
[36:36.600 --> 36:44.040]  The enemy is attacking civilization, they have a model of an armored high-tech fortress
[36:44.040 --> 36:53.200]  surrounded by third world death.
[36:53.200 --> 36:59.400]  And so getting to the point, when the talking point comes out, Trump's a dictator, Trump
[36:59.400 --> 37:03.760]  didn't get elected right, well now that's been proven to not be true.
[37:03.760 --> 37:09.840]  So now, oh, he's going to have martial law in two years when he loses.
[37:09.840 --> 37:18.600]  Now why is that? because they know that is one of the only paths to stop them.
[37:18.600 --> 37:21.800]  They're going to steal the 2020 election.
[37:21.800 --> 37:27.240]  Hillary currently is planning on running and I told you that months ago and I told you
[37:27.240 --> 37:31.760]  with who?
[37:31.760 --> 37:36.680]  Because I talked to people that were at the meeting.
[37:36.680 --> 37:42.280]  I talked to people that heard it and risked their lives to tell me that.
[37:42.280 --> 37:47.120]  I got told by one high-level individual, didn't cover it and like, hey, we're here with a
[37:47.120 --> 37:56.600]  message for you, you know, this is really going on, you tell people.
[37:56.600 --> 38:00.480]  You think that's safe to tell people about stuff like that?
[38:00.480 --> 38:03.920]  This is war, folks, this isn't a game.
[38:03.920 --> 38:11.440]  When they steal Georgia and Florida and Arizona and California and remove the best congress
[38:11.440 --> 38:17.040]  people we've got who polls showed were in deep red areas and should have won, when the
[38:17.040 --> 38:21.320]  numbers don't add up and you catch them red-handed stealing and it's people that are famous for
[38:21.320 --> 38:28.280]  stealing who've been convicted of stealing but never removed from power.
[38:28.280 --> 38:29.960]  That's martial law.
[38:29.960 --> 38:32.720]  That is anarchy.
[38:32.720 --> 38:36.160]  That is what brings martial law.
[38:36.160 --> 38:38.200]  That is the collapse of civilization.
[38:38.200 --> 38:43.400]  That is lawless groups ignoring the law and doing whatever they want for power.
[38:43.400 --> 38:48.160]  Martial law is ignoring the law because law and order has broken down.
[38:48.160 --> 38:50.600]  They are bringing the anarchy.
[38:50.600 --> 38:58.240]  They are bringing the precursor of either turning to a feudal state with strongmen and warlords
[38:58.240 --> 39:04.800]  and the U.S. breaks up because that's where this will go in an accelerated imperial demise.
[39:04.800 --> 39:09.600]  This is all a fight over the empire.
[39:09.600 --> 39:15.360]  Trump's trying to reform the empire, pull back its tentacles, export ideas, export goods,
[39:15.360 --> 39:19.840]  have a strong military but not have this untenable program that was meant to make us fail, by
[39:19.840 --> 39:22.600]  the way.
[39:22.600 --> 39:24.480]  And so they bring in the civil unrest.
[39:24.480 --> 39:25.880]  They bring in the doxing.
[39:25.880 --> 39:26.960]  They bring in the antifa.
[39:26.960 --> 39:28.320]  They bring in the physical attacks.
[39:28.320 --> 39:30.320]  They bring in the election fraud.
[39:30.320 --> 39:36.640]  That's all the removal of law and order, the social compact broken.
[39:36.640 --> 39:46.480]  Now if we don't respond to their criminal activity by inditing all of them and moving
[39:46.480 --> 39:54.000]  aggressively, now we've legitimized a hostile takeover that's lawless and that's called
[39:54.000 --> 39:57.280]  authoritarian rule, tyranny.
[39:57.280 --> 39:59.560]  The textbook, we're going into it.
[39:59.560 --> 40:01.000]  We're attempting to get the country back.
[40:01.000 --> 40:05.840]  They're counter-striking, uncloking with pure criminal activity.
[40:05.840 --> 40:09.600]  If we then bow to that because it's just too hard to believe they're doing it and they're
[40:09.600 --> 40:15.080]  acting so many of them in unison, that's their hope, it's a human wave attack of just lawsuits
[40:15.080 --> 40:20.160]  and fraud and stealing and corruption and lying.
[40:20.160 --> 40:24.960]  If we don't then respond with everything we've got, they will overrun us and are in the process
[40:24.960 --> 40:26.600]  of overrunning us politically right now.
[40:26.600 --> 40:28.840]  They are taking the country.
[40:28.840 --> 40:31.160]  The country is dying right now.
[40:31.160 --> 40:35.000]  I told you the danger of Trump getting in was it would make the enemy throw everything
[40:35.000 --> 40:37.560]  they had at us and we had to get ready for the next big assault.
[40:37.560 --> 40:38.720]  This is the war.
[40:38.720 --> 40:40.480]  This is the fight for the country.
[40:40.480 --> 40:43.400]  America is literally on its deathbed right now.
[40:43.400 --> 40:49.840]  We are being completely overrun by every form of criminal activity you can imagine.
[40:49.840 --> 40:55.600]  The prosperity, your pension funds, some of you out there, I don't care about anything
[40:55.600 --> 40:56.600]  but money.
[40:56.600 --> 40:58.120]  I'm not saying most of the audience, but some people.
[40:58.120 --> 41:01.840]  And so understand, the prosperity will all be gone because the globalists want you on
[41:01.840 --> 41:04.840]  your knees and they want to dictate everything to you.
[41:04.840 --> 41:08.400]  Once the tyranny comes in, all your prosperity is gone.
[41:08.400 --> 41:12.680]  Trump tried to open the door again for the prosperity you created and that you deserved.
[41:12.680 --> 41:16.240]  He tried to take their foot off your neck partially so you could get some air and he
[41:16.240 --> 41:19.560]  thought you'd appreciate it and come up for air and you did.
[41:19.560 --> 41:26.000]  We won the election, landslides, all the internal numbers show it.
[41:26.000 --> 41:31.040]  Their fraud didn't get over the top two years ago so they quadrupled down and don't even
[41:31.040 --> 41:35.560]  care if they get caught now because they're going to bring in total tyranny when they're
[41:35.560 --> 41:39.520]  done and that's what I'm telling you, the doors closing.
[41:39.520 --> 41:45.280]  Our daring raids worldwide, patriots, getting nationalists in to try to just remove a few
[41:45.280 --> 41:51.720]  globalist controls to turn economies on to show people has, has, has enraged the enemy
[41:51.720 --> 41:56.640]  and the enemy is now, Soros has spent more money in the last two years than he spent
[41:56.640 --> 41:59.360]  the last decade on political operations.
[41:59.360 --> 42:02.480]  They are throwing everything they've got at us.
[42:02.480 --> 42:04.600]  This is the total assault, people.
[42:04.600 --> 42:07.000]  This is it.
[42:07.000 --> 42:10.680]  And the sadness of the average American who isn't politically involved in a haze, not
[42:10.680 --> 42:17.160]  even knowing what's going on, is very, very sad.
[42:17.160 --> 42:21.000]  So again, when Mike Adams a few months ago said Trump is going to have to declare a civil
[42:21.000 --> 42:24.600]  emergency, we're in a civil emergency, Obama put us in one.
[42:24.600 --> 42:29.760]  Everyone, oh my God, Alex wants tanks on the streets, no.
[42:29.760 --> 42:32.720]  That's where it goes if the globalist takeover.
[42:32.720 --> 42:37.600]  What we're saying is they've already removed the law, we're already going in to the criminal
[42:37.600 --> 42:38.600]  takeover.
[42:38.600 --> 42:43.880]  Now, if we cannot get the attorney general and the FBI and others to move, the entire
[42:43.880 --> 42:48.200]  country is going to collapse for sure into civil war.
[42:48.200 --> 42:49.760]  That's another important point.
[42:49.760 --> 42:51.840]  This is not going to be successful by the Democrats.
[42:51.840 --> 42:59.520]  It's going to trigger a hot war for sure.
[42:59.520 --> 43:03.120]  Whether you're looking to boost the benefits of our official oil formula or just want an

[47:03.040 --> 47:30.040]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:30.040 --> 47:57.320]  We're here
[47:57.320 --> 48:06.220]  I want to be very, very clear about this, even though it'll obviously put me in the
[48:06.220 --> 48:07.220]  crosshairs even more.
[48:07.220 --> 48:12.520]  It's my duty to do it, and it's your duty to look at the evidence and really count the
[48:12.520 --> 48:17.700]  costs and face where we are as a country and as a world to get these messages out before
[48:17.700 --> 48:18.700]  it's too late.
[48:18.700 --> 48:22.580]  This country is on its deathbed right now.
[48:22.580 --> 48:27.440]  Trump and the patriots that have been able to get a beachhead in Washington are like
[48:27.440 --> 48:34.720]  special operations troops you parachute in behind enemy lines in an emergency operation
[48:34.720 --> 48:39.900]  because if you don't, you're going to lose the war, and it's not a safer good position
[48:39.900 --> 48:42.700]  for Trump and his family and what he's done.
[48:42.700 --> 48:49.920]  This country was already captured by multinational corporations, and we were in the process of
[48:49.920 --> 48:58.440]  being demoralized and balkanized and our American unity being destroyed, like any occupying
[48:58.440 --> 49:04.460]  force would do to a population they controlled, so we're really a divided nation.
[49:04.460 --> 49:07.180]  Those that have been brainwashed and served the globalists, those of us that are aware
[49:07.180 --> 49:10.500]  of what's happening, that we know America's not perfect, but it's a lot better than secret
[49:10.500 --> 49:16.220]  multinationals allied with China, controlling us.
[49:16.220 --> 49:19.220]  The Democrats have already put us into a form of martial law.
[49:19.220 --> 49:25.640]  They're already lawless, they're already acting as if Trump isn't the president, they're
[49:25.640 --> 49:31.980]  stealing elections everywhere, they're censoring, they're harassing, they're doxing, and they're
[49:31.980 --> 49:37.720]  calling for violence and they're calling for political overthrow and physical overthrow.
[49:37.720 --> 49:43.880]  When an outside group puts you into a civil emergency, it is not the right, it is the
[49:43.880 --> 49:50.020]  duty of the president, of anyone loyal in Congress, of anyone loyal to the law and constitution
[49:50.020 --> 50:01.240]  in the state or federal courts, to the governors, to the legislatures, to organize a plan to
[50:01.240 --> 50:08.340]  fully remove the traitorous deep state that openly says you can't even say we have a nation.
[50:08.340 --> 50:13.460]  That's what occupiers do, nations are bad, borders are bad, families are bad, your president
[50:13.460 --> 50:21.580]  is bad, your president is a Nazi, any other country that's sovereign is bad, UK bad, Russia
[50:21.580 --> 50:32.700]  bad, Italy bad, Brazil bad, because you're not under their illegitimate control.
[50:32.700 --> 50:38.220]  They came in, they bought off our leaders, we got down to the wire, Hillary was going
[50:38.220 --> 50:41.980]  to shut everything down when she got in, and Trump got in, so they're still just moving
[50:41.980 --> 50:45.540]  ahead with the original plan as if Trump is even president.
[50:45.540 --> 50:50.020]  We are under martial law, we are under a civil emergency, put in the Defense Authorization
[50:50.020 --> 50:58.860]  Act one month before he left office in December of 2016, Obama has established his domestic
[50:58.860 --> 51:05.660]  armies just as big and just as strong as the US military, they've done it.
[51:05.660 --> 51:13.580]  And so, what's left for the president to do, to have televised address to the nation, because
[51:13.580 --> 51:18.380]  as the advisers say, it'll tank the stock market, sir, it'll make us weak to foreign
[51:18.380 --> 51:19.380]  leaders.
[51:19.380 --> 51:24.100]  No, the whole world would join Trump in this, everyone is sick of the globalist, and the
[51:24.100 --> 51:28.020]  president just comes out and shows where they say America was never great, it's never going
[51:28.020 --> 51:33.940]  to be great, you can't say America, you have an American flag, you get physically attacked,
[51:33.940 --> 51:39.300]  these are the enemy, and just say we need all Americans to peacefully stand up, fly
[51:39.300 --> 51:44.500]  American flags in their yard, put them on your cars, make the statements everywhere,
[51:44.500 --> 51:49.420]  and rebuke anyone who says they're not an American or they hate America, and just simply
[51:49.420 --> 51:53.300]  point out that they're part of an enemy army, and let the Democrats and the globalists
[51:53.300 --> 51:58.340]  know we're coming after you for election fraud, and start arresting these people for
[51:58.340 --> 52:02.500]  all the crimes they've committed with uranium one and the chai comms and the servers, Hillary
[52:02.500 --> 52:08.180]  Clinton needs to be arrested, she's still operating with Obama as if she's still co-president
[52:08.180 --> 52:14.740]  like she was with Obama, she's already had four administrations, two with her husband,
[52:14.740 --> 52:24.180]  her beard, her male beard, and two with Obama, where she was co-president, he's had a female
[52:24.180 --> 52:37.100]  president, she's a witch, she's horrible, and so Hillary Clinton is still the president,
[52:37.100 --> 52:40.940]  Trump is only partial president, he has total mutiny underneath him by a bunch of cowards,
[52:40.940 --> 52:45.500]  let me tell you something, they come after everybody in his administration and then
[52:45.500 --> 52:49.740]  they threaten them and then they try to turn them, and they say listen just give us intel,
[52:49.740 --> 52:54.900]  work with us and we won't destroy you, they threaten your wives, your husbands, everything,
[52:54.900 --> 53:00.060]  they stalk you, they sue you, they harass you, it's unbelievable what they do, and most
[53:00.060 --> 53:04.900]  people start double dealing to cover their bases, and once they get you to start double
[53:04.900 --> 53:09.340]  dealing with these globalist enemies, then they go we're gonna let your boss know anyways
[53:09.340 --> 53:17.780]  if you don't totally roll and operate for us, these are criminal rat like thugs, and
[53:17.780 --> 53:24.540]  I can't stand before God if I don't tell you the bottom line, President Trump under the
[53:24.540 --> 53:28.700]  constitution and law, with all the crimes that have been committed, when you're overrun
[53:28.700 --> 53:33.620]  by foreign enemies, when you're overrun by people collapsing your country, who have infiltrated
[53:33.620 --> 53:43.060]  at every level, you have to do one of three things, you have to evacuate, which my ancestors
[53:43.060 --> 53:48.620]  did out of England on the Mayflower, first they went to the Netherlands, you've got
[53:48.620 --> 53:53.780]  to point out everything that's happened, go with the indictment route, push as hard as
[53:53.780 --> 53:59.140]  you can fast and try to indict their top leadership as quickly as possible, even though that's
[53:59.140 --> 54:08.180]  gonna start a bigger war, it's already here, they're already launching the big war, or
[54:08.180 --> 54:13.060]  when it goes to the military, which also has a bunch of yes men and at the top, and he'd
[54:13.060 --> 54:17.340]  probably have to remove most of the general staff up there and put a bunch of colonels
[54:17.340 --> 54:21.580]  and people in charge, and they're gonna have to go after all the globalist, they accused
[54:21.580 --> 54:27.580]  me of this months ago, and I didn't say do this, and they said I said get your battle
[54:27.580 --> 54:31.140]  rifles, go after the media, I didn't say that, I said the anti was coming to your house to
[54:31.140 --> 54:35.860]  kill you, if they go with the kill list, anti was just the cover for the real groups, you
[54:35.860 --> 54:40.100]  should have battle rifles ready to protect yourself, I'm simply laying out where the
[54:40.100 --> 54:45.420]  president is and where this country is, we can all just run the white flag up and bow
[54:45.420 --> 54:54.300]  down to the globalists and just say whatever you want, which the sky's the limit, or we
[54:54.300 --> 54:57.900]  can really understand that we've all got to get politically aggressive and we've got
[54:57.900 --> 55:01.500]  to totally back the president going into overdrive with massive indictments and it's
[55:01.500 --> 55:08.580]  gotta happen quick, that's plan B, was A, B, C, not saying you follow any of the plans,
[55:08.580 --> 55:14.820]  I'm laying this out, or there is what George Washington would do, and you know what George
[55:14.820 --> 55:22.180]  Washington would do, he'd make a list, he'd check it twice, and he ain't bringing presence
[55:22.180 --> 55:28.860]  like Santa Claus, so that's it, George Washington's George Washington for a reason, there's
[55:28.860 --> 55:34.220]  big ol' obelisk to his honor for a reason, because he took the biggest empire and nobody
[55:34.220 --> 55:38.620]  ever defeated and knocked him upside the head so long they gave up, even though we didn't
[55:38.620 --> 55:41.820]  hardly win any battles, we kept fighting, that's what this is about, and if we're gonna
[55:41.820 --> 55:45.980]  let the Democrats march in here and eat our lunch and say our kids belong to them and let
[55:45.980 --> 55:50.300]  them fund the Arab Spring and the overrunning of our borders and all the, and they're all
[55:50.300 --> 55:54.060]  involved in child trafficking and all the rest of it, if you want to let a bunch of child
[55:54.060 --> 55:59.540]  trafficking, child molesting devil whispers, run your country and bow down to them, then
[55:59.540 --> 56:03.620]  just go ahead and have it, but I see a lot of men driving around their big trucks acting
[56:03.620 --> 56:07.580]  tough everywhere, but you know what, I don't see it at the city council or the legislature,
[56:07.580 --> 56:10.540]  I don't see it going to Washington and going and talking to your senators, you know what
[56:10.540 --> 56:16.060]  happened to a million men, went to Washington and went and talked to their senators and
[56:16.060 --> 56:19.460]  house members, they didn't kiss their ass like they were God, but when they were actually
[56:19.460 --> 56:23.020]  talked to them straight up, and went and told the Democrats you know what's going on, you
[56:23.020 --> 56:30.420]  know what happened, you know, men, you need to have your hot wife go in and get intel
[56:30.420 --> 56:34.420]  on the globalist, that's how serious this stuff is, you need to go to the country club
[56:34.420 --> 56:38.540]  and infiltrate their operation, you need to have your wife go into their house and get
[56:38.540 --> 56:42.740]  into their stuff, this is war people, you know what we put up with around here, they're
[56:42.740 --> 56:47.180]  already trying to do all that to us, we're in a total war fight for this country and
[56:47.180 --> 56:51.060]  people better understand the Democrats don't follow any rules, they do whatever the hell
[56:51.060 --> 56:57.580]  they want, because they're child molesters, the pope who's hijacked the Catholic church
[56:57.580 --> 57:04.740]  said, we're not going to investigate pedophilia, no investigations, his deputy got caught running
[57:04.740 --> 57:11.260]  over a hundred little boys, they're finding dead bodies of kids all over the Vatican, they
[57:11.260 --> 57:18.620]  kill children, and everyone's like oh we better bow down to them, not me, I'm not scared of
[57:18.620 --> 57:27.100]  these people, I'm scared of God, so you remember that, this country's in a total war, you want
[57:27.100 --> 57:31.260]  freedom, well guess what ladies and gentlemen, you're going to get to do what other generations
[57:31.260 --> 57:39.180]  had to do, but it's a 21st century war, it's a psychological war, we won the election,
[57:39.180 --> 57:44.500]  Trump's restoring the country, they stole it, prosecute them, no after them to the criminal
[57:44.500 --> 57:48.340]  justice system, but every man and woman out there better decide what you're going to do
[57:48.340 --> 57:56.660]  to beat these people, we need to go back and revisit the foundations of our freedom, our
[57:56.660 --> 58:00.180]  freedoms don't consist of the things that are enumerated on a piece of paper, it consists
[58:00.180 --> 58:04.100]  of the things that we're willing to fight for, the first amendment, the bill of rights, the
[58:04.100 --> 58:10.060]  rest of the bill of rights are prohibitions, they're prohibitions against powerful organizations
[58:10.060 --> 58:15.100]  and individuals taking those God given rights from us as individuals, you better understand
[58:15.100 --> 58:22.260]  that because they're taking them right now, we have seen what they want to do, they called
[58:22.260 --> 58:28.020]  it UN Agenda 21, now they call it the UN 2030 Agenda, they want everybody off of the rural
[58:28.020 --> 58:33.140]  lands, they want people out of the suburbs, they want to pack everybody into the cities,
[58:33.140 --> 58:38.340]  because that's where it is easiest for them to control everyone, it's the David Knight

[01:00:14.740 --> 01:00:19.180]  Let me play the Donnie Deutsch piece, you know most talk shows would just play it up front
[01:00:19.180 --> 01:00:24.740]  and say over and over again, look how dumb he is, look how stupid he is, no, no, they're
[01:00:24.740 --> 01:00:32.340]  telling you what they fear, they're telling you what could stop them, they've already
[01:00:32.340 --> 01:00:36.820]  brought us into martial law, they've already brought us into their own criminal anarchy,
[01:00:36.820 --> 01:00:41.380]  where they selectively enforce the law, where they steal elections, where they censor, where
[01:00:41.380 --> 01:00:48.940]  they bully, where they attack, you can't swing a stick in any direction and not run into
[01:00:48.940 --> 01:00:56.740]  Clinton operatives running giant child kidnapping rings, and then I watched the media spend
[01:00:56.740 --> 01:01:02.060]  some fake story that we didn't even create about a pizza place so they could distract
[01:01:02.060 --> 01:01:07.580]  off onto that, when you've got all these different top aids to Hillary convicted of smuggling
[01:01:07.580 --> 01:01:13.380]  kidnapped kids, why do you think they want immigrant caravans coming in here, not just
[01:01:13.380 --> 01:01:17.940]  to vote, not just to drive down wages, they're bringing smuggled children, that's even the
[01:01:17.940 --> 01:01:29.020]  Washington Post that end up dead, you know, snake eyes, exes in the eyes, these people,
[01:01:29.020 --> 01:01:34.140]  you have to understand they are pure evil, all the folks go, oh, Jones, in fact there
[01:01:34.140 --> 01:01:39.420]  was an article I was going to read from like a year ago, I came back across it, you know,
[01:01:39.420 --> 01:01:41.820]  if you're worried Trump's going to destroy the planet with nuclear war, you have this
[01:01:41.820 --> 01:01:46.820]  kind of thing for it, Alex Jones, and then she twists these things I've said and some
[01:01:46.820 --> 01:01:49.860]  of the things I have said, and I'm reading all these things that I've said, it's like
[01:01:49.860 --> 01:01:56.780]  it's all true, I mean they aren't digging up dead kids that were killed in these sacrifices
[01:01:56.780 --> 01:02:01.260]  at the Vatican since the 80s, and people knew where their kids went and always thought it
[01:02:01.260 --> 01:02:04.500]  was the Vatican, and now they found them, and the very priests that they reportedly said
[01:02:04.500 --> 01:02:12.820]  were running satanic covens inside the Vatican are the ones, apartments where it's found,
[01:02:12.820 --> 01:02:17.620]  and I was just reading, this lady attacked me for all this stuff, I mean the Brits know
[01:02:17.620 --> 01:02:21.260]  that their government's run by pedophiles as well at the top, to a great extent that's
[01:02:21.260 --> 01:02:24.460]  how they control people, that's all with the news, I mean it's like one in Telegraph, there
[01:02:24.460 --> 01:02:31.220]  are giant pedophile rings running England, and then they let the Muslims come in and
[01:02:31.220 --> 01:02:36.420]  do it, there's a huge grooming gang, thousands of girls per town, where are the feminists,
[01:02:36.420 --> 01:02:47.180]  where's Christina Blasey Ford, this is who they are, this is what they do, I mean how
[01:02:47.180 --> 01:02:53.940]  would we sign on to this, and now it's out in the open, and I don't want the president
[01:02:53.940 --> 01:03:01.980]  to declare a civil emergency and go after all these people, they're already stealing
[01:03:01.980 --> 01:03:06.260]  elections calling for civil emergencies, saying drive them from power, they're already lawless,
[01:03:06.260 --> 01:03:12.980]  that's a form of martial law that's coming from a political class that wasn't even elected,
[01:03:12.980 --> 01:03:25.740]  so what do we do, when you're faced with criminal assault, what are we going to do, and you
[01:03:25.740 --> 01:03:32.780]  know these pedophile rings, it's in the British papers, they find the dead kids all the time,
[01:03:32.780 --> 01:03:38.460]  they had BBC reporters go public in the 90's and say no, I was there when they took the
[01:03:38.460 --> 01:03:42.060]  little girl in and they slid her throat and her blood spray everywhere and they had plastic
[01:03:42.060 --> 01:03:48.820]  on the floor and they all stood around masturbating while she flopped around like a dying fish,
[01:03:48.820 --> 01:03:53.980]  and then it comes out it's true, you know, these people will march your daughters in
[01:03:53.980 --> 01:03:57.740]  and take a dagger and slit their throat and wash them bleed out because that makes them
[01:03:57.740 --> 01:04:03.460]  feel good all day long, you know let them run things, and all you Google people and
[01:04:03.460 --> 01:04:09.700]  all you riders that cover up for it, it's on you now, you now are just as guilty as
[01:04:09.700 --> 01:04:20.180]  the people slitting those throats, you maggots, that's who you are, be proud of it I guess,
[01:04:20.180 --> 01:04:30.780]  I'm a little hardcore today, Britain's worst pedophile, yeah you mean a procurer for the
[01:04:30.780 --> 01:04:38.340]  establishment, you mean their scapegoat, oh we got a bunch of big guys today, I haven't
[01:04:38.340 --> 01:04:43.740]  gotten to that, I haven't even played this clip yet but we'll tag it on the upload, it's
[01:04:43.740 --> 01:04:50.020]  on themfullwars.com, you just got to understand folks, everywhere they run collapses because
[01:04:50.020 --> 01:04:59.100]  Dracula didn't like rich villages around, he likes lots of poor scared people, please
[01:04:59.100 --> 01:05:03.460]  whatever you do realize that we're all getting punched drunk to the censorship and you saw
[01:05:03.460 --> 01:05:06.940]  18 Twitter accounts, they say affiliated with them Fullwars, yeah some of them are like
[01:05:06.940 --> 01:05:11.180]  little side accounts they even know we had like info or store that just showed our products
[01:05:11.180 --> 01:05:15.740]  but they just banned them all yesterday in punishment that I be at a Trump rally and
[01:05:15.740 --> 01:05:19.940]  be mobbed by all these folks that loved us, you're excitement about America, you're excitement
[01:05:19.940 --> 01:05:23.540]  about this broadcast is what brought the country and the world back from the brink, but the
[01:05:23.540 --> 01:05:29.340]  globalists now want to target where the resistance came from so that we're not pesky in the future,
[01:05:29.340 --> 01:05:35.140]  I want to be troublesome and pesky, I want to keep going, I want to make them do the
[01:05:35.140 --> 01:05:39.860]  ultimate not just destroy us financially, I want to push all the way, I've committed
[01:05:39.860 --> 01:05:43.940]  to do that, I've prayed for that and I've been told that's going to happen, but you've
[01:05:43.940 --> 01:05:49.460]  got to back us and I promise you this, I will never falter, I will never waver at the spiritual
[01:05:49.460 --> 01:05:53.940]  level, I physically will, but I give you my commitment if you financially support us at
[01:05:53.940 --> 01:05:59.980]  Fullwars.com to give you my absolute total commitment.
[01:05:59.980 --> 01:06:06.460]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups, you want to stop tyranny?
[01:06:06.460 --> 01:06:22.900]  Well so does he, live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:22.900 --> 01:06:26.380]  Some good music right here when you're going about 60 miles an hour on a boat over a lake
[01:06:26.380 --> 01:06:38.300]  that's real smooth, he hits some decent sized waves in the boats.
[01:06:38.300 --> 01:06:43.060]  I'm told by a lot of different people though, this is the US military's favorite going into
[01:06:43.060 --> 01:06:49.100]  combat song, you know the kind of everybody agrees on, people that like the country, people
[01:06:49.100 --> 01:06:57.020]  that like the death metal, people that like the whatever, this is the going to war music,
[01:06:57.020 --> 01:07:04.100]  flying around little helicopters with the miniguns.
[01:07:04.100 --> 01:07:09.380]  You know this country's at war and you've got to be willing to be demonized and attacked
[01:07:09.380 --> 01:07:14.500]  and lied about by the establishment, by the traitors, if you want to have any chance of
[01:07:14.500 --> 01:07:20.580]  changing things, you've got to get out of the shell of being intimidated by these people.
[01:07:20.580 --> 01:07:23.700]  And amazing things have happened, a lot of good things have happened, but the Democrats
[01:07:23.700 --> 01:07:27.060]  have put us into a civil emergency, they've put us into their own martial law, when you're
[01:07:27.060 --> 01:07:32.860]  stealing elections, you're calling for violence, when you're suing the president over every
[01:07:32.860 --> 01:07:40.340]  action he takes, when the actions he's taking are legitimate and are completely cut in stone,
[01:07:40.340 --> 01:07:43.420]  you're in martial law.
[01:07:43.420 --> 01:07:50.020]  The different variants of that term, but martial law means the regular laws are suspended,
[01:07:50.020 --> 01:07:55.420]  the social contract is suspended, and there's different types of martial law and they're
[01:07:55.420 --> 01:08:02.060]  all on a scale, but when it comes to censorship, this country is about a six or a seven right
[01:08:02.060 --> 01:08:08.740]  now, we were about a one or a two just six months ago, see how we're going downhill,
[01:08:08.740 --> 01:08:15.340]  we're sliding fast down the slippery slope, and with the silencing comes everything else,
[01:08:15.340 --> 01:08:20.820]  you see, or at least what they believe is silencing, they realize they haven't silenced
[01:08:20.820 --> 01:08:24.780]  anybody, because you understand what's happening, you're spreading the word now more than ever,
[01:08:24.780 --> 01:08:29.820]  not just about info horse, but about what's happening, period.
[01:08:29.820 --> 01:08:33.060]  You're getting more involved in the third dimension, putting up signs and stickers, you're
[01:08:33.060 --> 01:08:37.660]  talking to people more, you're asking to go speak in front of the church, you're calling
[01:08:37.660 --> 01:08:40.580]  them to talk radio and c-span, you're going down and talking to your congresswoman or
[01:08:40.580 --> 01:08:49.580]  man from both parties and getting in their face, and so they're going to turn the heat
[01:08:49.580 --> 01:08:52.660]  up, that's what tyrants always do, you've heard the tighter they squeeze, the more
[01:08:52.660 --> 01:08:58.140]  falls through their fingers, but they think we're weak now, they think we're all entertained
[01:08:58.140 --> 01:09:02.620]  to death, and they think when push comes to shove, we're going to play it safe, like
[01:09:02.620 --> 01:09:08.100]  all those other timid souls and other countries and cultures that they've devoured, and that's
[01:09:08.100 --> 01:09:11.900]  what this is, I want to be very clear, this isn't business as usual, this isn't oh, there's
[01:09:11.900 --> 01:09:15.620]  always been corruption, there's always been problems, no this is the big takeover, you
[01:09:15.620 --> 01:09:24.740]  can see it, you can feel it, you can smell it, this is it.
[01:09:24.740 --> 01:09:27.660]  All over the world it's happening, people are fighting back and the enemy's throwing
[01:09:27.660 --> 01:09:33.820]  all their weight, but they believe are juggernauts of hundreds of billions of dollars of propaganda
[01:09:33.820 --> 01:09:38.180]  and minions and their little mercenaries that all get the talking points and all put them
[01:09:38.180 --> 01:09:45.660]  out simultaneously, so I don't want martial law, we're under criminal martial law, we're
[01:09:45.660 --> 01:09:52.020]  under mafia rule, which is the worst form of martial law, it's not in an emergency
[01:09:52.020 --> 01:09:58.860]  because of a nuclear reactor going off or a hurricane limited martial law, it's complete
[01:09:58.860 --> 01:10:09.060]  and total lawlessness by a criminal class, a glow with the demonic criminal energy of
[01:10:09.060 --> 01:10:20.140]  the excitement of the enterprise they're involved in, and so if you don't resist that, by every
[01:10:20.140 --> 01:10:27.940]  way you can, and you let them ratchet up the attack and the threat continue them, until
[01:10:27.940 --> 01:10:33.100]  they're at a 10 and we're sitting here at a 1, that's how you get conquered without
[01:10:33.100 --> 01:10:38.620]  a shot being fired, and I'm simply stating to the military, the police, everyone knows
[01:10:38.620 --> 01:10:42.820]  the democrats and the globalists are openly saying you can't be an American, the country
[01:10:42.820 --> 01:10:47.620]  is evil, saying nationalism is bad, you know China went to Davos and said we'll help defeat
[01:10:47.620 --> 01:10:52.180]  Trump in America two years ago, that was a declaration of war, they're shooting at our
[01:10:52.180 --> 01:10:58.220]  ships on a daily basis, they're frying our people with microwave guns, we're at war
[01:10:58.220 --> 01:11:01.260]  ladies and gentlemen, and the democrats are working with them, that's why they use Russia
[01:11:01.260 --> 01:11:06.220]  as the distraction over there, total crap, Russia's not involved, just a fact, Pentagon
[01:11:06.220 --> 01:11:14.220]  knows that, I've been in the committee hearings where Senator Cotton and others bring up,
[01:11:14.220 --> 01:11:19.460]  you know China is infiltrating, is censoring, is buying off our media, which is public,
[01:11:19.460 --> 01:11:24.620]  and the democrats will go, oh Russia, oh Russia, oh Russia, and these weird little criminals
[01:11:24.620 --> 01:11:28.260]  you look at and it's like, where did this guy come from, it's like you know, Elmer Fudd
[01:11:28.260 --> 01:11:33.500]  or something, it's like, I tell you what, I'm worried about them Russians, that child
[01:11:33.500 --> 01:11:38.220]  is good, I don't blame them for trying to do stuff here, I like what they're doing,
[01:11:38.220 --> 01:11:43.460]  and you're sitting there just going, my God, it's like beyond a movie, well I'd like to
[01:11:43.460 --> 01:11:47.140]  talk about the embedded secret chips we found in all our military hardware and all the iPhones
[01:11:47.140 --> 01:12:00.500]  that's stealing everybody's data and lifetime, and so now here we are, and the democrats
[01:12:00.500 --> 01:12:06.180]  have tested and pushed, and only Trump has come out with congressman Matt Gaetz, thank
[01:12:06.180 --> 01:12:10.180]  God, redeeming himself, and a few people have said the democrats are stealing all these
[01:12:10.180 --> 01:12:15.180]  states, there's total proof, it's an election that just keeps going eight, nine days after
[01:12:15.180 --> 01:12:21.460]  it closes, they're stealing back all of our gains, governors, senate races, everything,
[01:12:21.460 --> 01:12:24.980]  what are you doing, do something, the governor says do something, and the state police say
[01:12:24.980 --> 01:12:29.540]  no, we're not going to, he should fire the head of that highway patrol like that, and
[01:12:29.540 --> 01:12:36.220]  keep putting people in until they did what he said in the first hour, but what we've
[01:12:36.220 --> 01:12:42.100]  got is a government filled with cowards and scum that aren't really evil most of them,
[01:12:42.100 --> 01:12:45.980]  they're just like, we're not going to mess with the democrats and brow it, that's the
[01:12:45.980 --> 01:12:51.780]  clinton's, why any of us do that, they might come after our children, they're already coming
[01:12:51.780 --> 01:12:59.100]  after your children you idiots, you fools, America's built on not being cowards and pushed
[01:12:59.100 --> 01:13:06.980]  around by cartels, all the wealth came from what's between your legs that you're not using,
[01:13:06.980 --> 01:13:14.740]  grow some, Trump gives orders, everyone craps down the side of their leg, they roll over
[01:13:14.740 --> 01:13:22.580]  and piss themselves, Trump is literally surrounded by cowards and scum and trash, the entire
[01:13:22.580 --> 01:13:36.340]  swamp based on butt kissing and lying and selling out, put in there to kill the country,
[01:13:36.340 --> 01:13:41.020]  and so Hillary sees this, you know, how do you know she's running for president for sure,
[01:13:41.020 --> 01:13:44.620]  two weeks ago when she said she's definitely not going to run again, I should guarantee
[01:13:44.620 --> 01:13:51.100]  she's running, plus I've talked to folks that were, let's just say in the meeting but weren't
[01:13:51.100 --> 01:13:55.420]  and outside the meeting, it's all planned, the democrats all know it's Hillary and it's
[01:13:55.420 --> 01:14:00.180]  Michelle Obama, that might change but right now currently that's the plan, and of course
[01:14:00.180 --> 01:14:08.020]  now she's come out again and said yeah, I'm going to run probably, because if they can
[01:14:08.020 --> 01:14:13.660]  steal every election and if they can do this with key counties and if they can do this,
[01:14:13.660 --> 01:14:19.100]  they're going to go to the states, the three or four states in the rust belt where they've
[01:14:19.100 --> 01:14:23.660]  got democrat machines still in control of machines and they are going to deliver it
[01:14:23.660 --> 01:14:29.820]  to Hillary, Rodham, Clinton and she's going to be announcing in the next six months to
[01:14:29.820 --> 01:14:40.900]  a year, it's on ladies and gentlemen and boy when Hillary gets in you better get ready
[01:14:40.900 --> 01:14:47.140]  because she'll exercise the power, she'll give the order to start killing the opposition
[01:14:47.140 --> 01:14:50.700]  and everybody lets this happen, you might as well just stick your head in the guillotine
[01:14:50.700 --> 01:14:58.180]  and pull the switch yourself, because that woman was born to drive a big old dagger right
[01:14:58.180 --> 01:15:06.340]  into our heart, she's a satanic heat seeking missile coming right for your children, her
[01:15:06.340 --> 01:15:12.380]  specialty out of college was to serve rich pedophiles who kidnapped and raped children,
[01:15:12.380 --> 01:15:20.540]  her chosen profession was to bathe in pure evil, she was kicked off even the democrats
[01:15:20.540 --> 01:15:26.220]  commission for lying and trying to set up Richard Nixon, her father was a very powerful
[01:15:26.220 --> 01:15:36.740]  Chicago mobster, he told her sissy, you go down to our base in Arkansas, that's the Chicago's
[01:15:36.740 --> 01:15:42.980]  real man base, there's some good old boys down there, you go represent them pedophiles
[01:15:42.980 --> 01:15:48.300]  and you'll be in the club, she's like daddy I don't really like kids, I like killing them,
[01:15:48.300 --> 01:15:51.980]  like girls, she's like hey it doesn't matter, go down there and you take care of those boys,
[01:15:51.980 --> 01:15:59.580]  you go right to the top, you go right to the top, the United States of Empire is a book
[01:15:59.580 --> 01:16:04.900]  that claims the United States is the empire of the world, George Washington had warned
[01:16:04.900 --> 01:16:11.260]  us against foreign wars, the United States of Empire shows that World Wars 1 and 2 left
[01:16:11.260 --> 01:16:17.660]  England broken, it's former colony the US had to save the empire, was there ever a vote,
[01:16:17.660 --> 01:16:23.700]  who do we fight for, the deep state began with World War 1, the United States of Empire
[01:16:23.700 --> 01:16:27.420]  by James Dunn available at Amazon books.

[01:18:58.020 --> 01:19:02.060]  The globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment
[01:19:02.060 --> 01:19:07.300]  full of the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromide, you name it, that it lowers IQ, it
[01:19:07.300 --> 01:19:12.380]  literally dumbs the population down and on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers
[01:19:12.380 --> 01:19:18.740]  the best iodine in the world, we've gone through two permutations, first seaweed based iodine
[01:19:18.740 --> 01:19:22.060]  that was pretty good but hard to source and the globalists tried to block us getting a
[01:19:22.060 --> 01:19:27.020]  supply of it, so we discovered deep earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and brought
[01:19:27.020 --> 01:19:31.820]  you X2, that's been incredible, now due to the establishment trying to block that, we
[01:19:31.820 --> 01:19:37.500]  did more research and secured more of the deep earth crystals of nascent iodine, but
[01:19:37.500 --> 01:19:41.260]  chemists, scientists and others showed us the research that by combining it with three
[01:19:41.260 --> 01:19:48.060]  other compounds, two forms of iodine and vitamin C, it supercharges it and makes it even more
[01:19:48.060 --> 01:19:53.300]  bioavailable, ladies and gentlemen, you want to research it, you want to see it, it's an
[01:19:53.300 --> 01:20:01.500]  incredible discovery, X3, now available at m4slife.com.
[01:20:01.500 --> 01:20:11.660]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:20:11.660 --> 01:20:41.500]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:41.500 --> 01:20:56.900]  I don't want to go on the air and say the Vatican is run by a bunch of pedophiles, it's
[01:20:56.900 --> 01:21:00.940]  now mainstream news, including killing kits, I don't want to go on the air and say Hillary
[01:21:00.940 --> 01:21:06.820]  Clinton represented brutal child kidnappers and pedophiles as her main job out of college
[01:21:06.820 --> 01:21:09.700]  with a law degree, it's true.
[01:21:09.700 --> 01:21:16.940]  I don't want to have to go up against these people, but no one else will really do it.
[01:21:16.940 --> 01:21:20.380]  Don't you see the danger in everyone just laying down to these people?
[01:21:20.380 --> 01:21:26.100]  Trump is standing up against them and then a lot of people don't even want to stand
[01:21:26.100 --> 01:21:29.940]  proudly with him because they don't want some of their friends or neighbors to stop
[01:21:29.940 --> 01:21:30.940]  being their friends.
[01:21:30.940 --> 01:21:34.700]  Well, if somebody's not your friend because you believe the nation state exists and you
[01:21:34.700 --> 01:21:39.180]  believe that we should cut taxes and regulations and you believe we shouldn't have one sided
[01:21:39.180 --> 01:21:44.500]  trade deals, then that's not your friend.
[01:21:44.500 --> 01:21:48.820]  Those are empty people who wants to be around a bunch of empty people.
[01:21:48.820 --> 01:21:58.020]  You know, the place I want to be is risking my name, my treasure, my life to stand up
[01:21:58.020 --> 01:22:06.140]  against these people doesn't mean I like the different potentialities.
[01:22:06.140 --> 01:22:17.060]  I've already been treated to quite a bit of nastiness, but that only emboldens me, steals
[01:22:17.060 --> 01:22:26.820]  as in the metal, my will, knowing that while it's worse than we thought, Hillary set to
[01:22:26.820 --> 01:22:33.580]  run for office again, as we told you.
[01:22:33.580 --> 01:22:38.420]  The murder of logic where she's going to run, she's not going to run, she pledges she won't
[01:22:38.420 --> 01:22:42.020]  run, she said she never said she wouldn't run.
[01:22:42.020 --> 01:22:46.540]  Obama cares free and keep her doctor, I never said it was free, never said you keep her
[01:22:46.540 --> 01:22:47.540]  doctor.
[01:22:47.540 --> 01:22:49.820]  Thank God you're so stupid.
[01:22:49.820 --> 01:22:55.140]  The architect of it says on C-SPAN, these people are so used to sitting behind closed
[01:22:55.140 --> 01:22:58.220]  doors talking about you like you're a bunch of dumb idiots that they're going to screw
[01:22:58.220 --> 01:23:02.660]  over, that they do it on TV.
[01:23:02.660 --> 01:23:11.140]  Hillary famously tells the most, you know, racist jokes and hates black people, absolutely
[01:23:11.140 --> 01:23:12.140]  hates them.
[01:23:12.140 --> 01:23:15.980]  She hates everybody, but she really hates black people.
[01:23:15.980 --> 01:23:21.180]  So she's the one black people have all got to love, it's all a sick joke.
[01:23:21.180 --> 01:23:28.780]  Now you just look at Jim Acosta, he's the perfect guy you'd hire to play a sniveling
[01:23:28.780 --> 01:23:30.860]  con man in a movie.
[01:23:30.860 --> 01:23:34.420]  Just the eyes, the things he says, everything he says is a lie.
[01:23:34.420 --> 01:23:35.420]  There's no caravan.
[01:23:35.420 --> 01:23:39.340]  Remember at first we've got to let everybody come up here now, there's no caravan, Trump's
[01:23:39.340 --> 01:23:46.020]  like yeah there's a caravan, no there's not, you're not taking the microphone, oh I didn't
[01:23:46.020 --> 01:23:51.220]  do that, I didn't touch her, it's all just this exercise of criminality, you say well
[01:23:51.220 --> 01:23:57.700]  they're a bunch of idiots, people are awake to them, yeah people are awake and we're
[01:23:57.700 --> 01:24:02.300]  voting in patriots and taking over the Republican party with patriots, that scares the globalist,
[01:24:02.300 --> 01:24:08.780]  30-something Republicans retired trying to give the house to the Dems, that didn't work
[01:24:08.780 --> 01:24:13.580]  so they just stole and because they didn't get in trouble stealing a couple seats last
[01:24:13.580 --> 01:24:18.420]  week, hell they're stealing more today and governorships and Senate seats, why not?
[01:24:18.420 --> 01:24:21.700]  Why shouldn't Hillary run again?
[01:24:21.700 --> 01:24:28.220]  Because this time they might not even make it look close, hell they might have the whole
[01:24:28.220 --> 01:24:35.180]  country blue and say zero voted for Trump, you're like well that'll be obvious, yeah
[01:24:35.180 --> 01:24:41.740]  it's called rubbing your nose in it.
[01:24:41.740 --> 01:24:46.620]  So this is not a negative broadcast, this is not a negative broadcast, this is something
[01:24:46.620 --> 01:24:51.780]  that's very, very positive to sit up here and to tell the truth about what's really
[01:24:51.780 --> 01:24:52.780]  going on.
[01:24:52.780 --> 01:24:57.700]  Did you guys print me that article that I wanted out of the Washington Post please?
[01:24:57.700 --> 01:25:04.860]  So I'm going to cover it next segment now, I'll need it then, thank you.
[01:25:04.860 --> 01:25:07.860]  I've got some big news that we're going to cover on the other side but I'm going to
[01:25:07.860 --> 01:25:16.700]  make it till then and then I'm going to go through all the clips, Donny Dewey suggests
[01:25:16.700 --> 01:25:19.700]  Trump will stage military coup to stay in power, that's what they're scared of because
[01:25:19.700 --> 01:25:21.900]  they're already bringing us into a coup.
[01:25:21.900 --> 01:25:25.820]  You try to stop a coup, see your back.
[01:25:25.820 --> 01:25:32.460]  Hillary drops another hint, she's planning to run for president again.
[01:25:32.460 --> 01:25:34.980]  I want to look at how they're trying to drive down the economy and how that's an act of
[01:25:34.980 --> 01:25:35.980]  treason.
[01:25:35.980 --> 01:25:40.220]  Actually look at the graphs, the minute he got elected the economy came back because
[01:25:40.220 --> 01:25:46.620]  he promised to get rid of a bunch of the regulations that decided to tie us down and the globalist
[01:25:46.620 --> 01:25:51.540]  knew that just doing that would turn the economy around and a lot of investors knew that but
[01:25:51.540 --> 01:25:58.420]  now Maxine Waters has said she's going to reverse it all in Congress and so people are
[01:25:58.420 --> 01:26:01.820]  going to start not moving their factories here and all the rest of it you see because
[01:26:01.820 --> 01:26:06.900]  the Democrats are going to keep their foot on your neck as long as they can.
[01:26:06.900 --> 01:26:13.380]  They're going to turn your town or city into a cross between San Francisco and Detroit.
[01:26:13.380 --> 01:26:21.500]  We've got a very powerful NBC report admitting the nightmare that is San Francisco.
[01:26:21.500 --> 01:26:23.980]  Everywhere they run it becomes living hell.
[01:26:23.980 --> 01:26:29.540]  Southern California is on fire with people leaving high skilled, high intelligence, high
[01:26:29.540 --> 01:26:37.500]  IQ, leaving bigger than the exodus of Jews out of Egypt under Moses and income the worst
[01:26:37.500 --> 01:26:43.340]  of the worst of the third world, unskilled with pre-existing conditions, mental illness,
[01:26:43.340 --> 01:26:46.060]  criminal records and baby.
[01:26:46.060 --> 01:26:51.660]  They're so hyped up on UN and globalist brainwashing, the rudeness, the hatred, the way they treat
[01:26:51.660 --> 01:26:58.860]  the border patrol, people, everything they're just like, I'm here, you're my butler and
[01:26:58.860 --> 01:27:00.220]  I'm going to do whatever I want.
[01:27:00.220 --> 01:27:06.020]  It is the total collapse of civilization by design.
[01:27:06.020 --> 01:27:12.580]  They're given power by their father the devil because they want to destroy everything and
[01:27:12.580 --> 01:27:13.820]  we must realize that.
[01:27:13.820 --> 01:27:21.220]  We have a special guest who's a Democrat coming on and a member of the Senate in Louisiana.
[01:27:21.220 --> 01:27:29.980]  He wrote Robert Mueller, Aaron Boyd for the New World Order, John Milkovich.
[01:27:29.980 --> 01:27:35.340]  That's going to be very interesting next hour.
[01:27:35.340 --> 01:27:39.500]  And we're just telling you like it is here, folks, told you 20 years ago there were satanic
[01:27:39.500 --> 01:27:43.700]  pedophile rings in the Vatican now it's mainstream news, told you they'd say nation states are
[01:27:43.700 --> 01:27:48.380]  evil and even saying the country exists will become a hate crime punishable by not being
[01:27:48.380 --> 01:27:51.380]  able to engage in commerce.
[01:27:51.380 --> 01:27:56.060]  Soon I'm going to release secret documents.
[01:27:56.060 --> 01:27:57.060]  We have the documents.
[01:27:57.060 --> 01:28:02.460]  I'm probably going to sue, though, to have chain of custody of it and it's going to be
[01:28:02.460 --> 01:28:06.660]  a major national scandal because they're planning this for everybody.
[01:28:06.660 --> 01:28:10.460]  They're going to put a designation on you if you're a Christian, a conservative nationalist
[01:28:10.460 --> 01:28:16.500]  and you're not going to know why everything costs more and why you don't have credit.
[01:28:16.500 --> 01:28:20.940]  Just like the IRS harassed over 10,000 churches and Christian groups and conservative groups
[01:28:20.940 --> 01:28:25.420]  and gave basically no nonprofits out while Obama was in for conservatives or Christians
[01:28:25.420 --> 01:28:28.540]  or veterans groups, it's the same thing.
[01:28:28.540 --> 01:28:31.540]  It's just total economic terrorism and why shouldn't they?
[01:28:31.540 --> 01:28:34.100]  They never got in trouble at the IRS.
[01:28:34.100 --> 01:28:38.020]  I mean, if any congressman said or did anything about it, maybe they'd get audited.
[01:28:38.020 --> 01:28:40.940]  So let's just put our tail between our legs and pee on ourselves like we're a little shaking
[01:28:40.940 --> 01:28:41.940]  dog.
[01:28:41.940 --> 01:28:44.860]  Oh, you engage in mass persecution and brag about it.
[01:28:44.860 --> 01:28:46.460]  I won't say anything.
[01:28:46.460 --> 01:28:47.460]  Don't hurt me.
[01:28:47.460 --> 01:28:48.460]  He don't hurt me.
[01:28:48.460 --> 01:28:50.300]  That means we all get screwed.
[01:28:50.300 --> 01:28:57.300]  Don't you understand that, men?
[01:28:57.300 --> 01:28:58.300]  Trading involves financial risk.
[01:28:58.300 --> 01:29:00.140]  It is not suitable for all investors.
[01:29:00.140 --> 01:29:03.780]  Marijuana has unleashed a green gold rush across our nation.
[01:29:03.780 --> 01:29:09.340]  It's creating $10.8 billion in new wealth a year and every day it's transforming more
[01:29:09.340 --> 01:29:12.100]  and more Americans into millionaires.
[01:29:12.100 --> 01:29:16.580]  Our speaker of the House, John Boehner, reveals how you could become one of them.
[01:29:16.580 --> 01:29:19.340]  Join him online for the American Cannabis Summit.
[01:29:19.340 --> 01:29:23.100]  Attendance is 100% free, but space is limited.

[01:29:27.980 --> 01:29:32.940]  John Boehner and an esteemed panel will reveal which cannabis stocks are prime to deliver
[01:29:32.940 --> 01:29:34.740]  life-changing windfalls.
[01:29:34.740 --> 01:29:40.180]  Plus, they will show you how to become a cannabis angel investor, backing the hottest startups
[01:29:40.180 --> 01:29:43.620]  before they potentially become worth billions of dollars.

[01:29:58.660 --> 01:30:03.820]  Words cannot describe how big the stakes are for the future of humanity right now.
[01:30:03.820 --> 01:30:06.860]  InfoWords is being openly targeted by the Democratic Party.
[01:30:06.860 --> 01:30:10.140]  Leftist CIA operatives, the corrupt justice department, and the entire country.
[01:30:10.140 --> 01:30:11.780]  The entire Soros crime syndicate.
[01:30:11.780 --> 01:30:14.420]  People say, why would you start a fight with them?
[01:30:14.420 --> 01:30:17.780]  Because they were already dominating and running America into the ground.
[01:30:17.780 --> 01:30:19.980]  And I knew we had no future if we didn't do this.
[01:30:19.980 --> 01:30:22.700]  So we've already had incredible success.
[01:30:22.700 --> 01:30:27.620]  But if you will simply realize how epic this is and understand how real this fight is and
[01:30:27.620 --> 01:30:29.620]  why we've been made the main target.
[01:30:29.620 --> 01:30:34.820]  And if you financially support us and if you spread the word about our articles and videos,
[01:30:34.820 --> 01:30:39.980]  infowords.com, we won't just continue to stand up against these brutal scumbags.
[01:30:39.980 --> 01:30:40.980]  We'll win.
[01:30:40.980 --> 01:30:43.500]  We have huge sales at infowords.com right now.
[01:30:43.500 --> 01:30:47.660]  And we're still able to operate the shopping cart and get stuff shipped out to you despite
[01:30:47.660 --> 01:30:51.220]  the fact that we're trying to block our commerce and you're right to the market.
[01:30:51.220 --> 01:30:54.940]  But if you don't stand up and support us financially, Soros and Globalist may win.
[01:30:54.940 --> 01:30:56.460]  This is InfoWords Darkness Hour.
[01:30:56.460 --> 01:30:57.460]  We're your support.
[01:30:57.460 --> 01:30:58.460]  I'm counting on you.
[01:30:58.460 --> 01:31:03.580]  Do you realize that when you spread the links from infowords.com, when you spread the videos,
[01:31:03.580 --> 01:31:05.820]  you are changing the world.
[01:31:05.820 --> 01:31:09.540]  It's you that has defeated Hillary and the Globalist.
[01:31:09.540 --> 01:31:14.100]  It is you, the Info Warriors across the planet that stood against the bullying, that stood
[01:31:14.100 --> 01:31:18.020]  against the peer pressure, that stood against the threats that have now changed the world.
[01:31:18.020 --> 01:31:22.860]  And that's why you've been on the team supporting us, praying for us and spreading the word.
[01:31:22.860 --> 01:31:23.860]  You are the InfoWord.
[01:31:23.860 --> 01:31:28.940]  And now because of their intensifying censorship, it's more important than ever that everyone
[01:31:28.940 --> 01:31:34.020]  go to infowords.com forward slash newsletter and sign up via email so there's no way the
[01:31:34.020 --> 01:31:39.860]  censors can get between us with critical videos, articles, breaking news, intel, you name it.
[01:31:39.860 --> 01:31:45.420]  And so now I ask you more than ever to share the InfoWords.com articles, to share the videos,
[01:31:45.420 --> 01:31:48.660]  to tell people by the local stations you're listening to, but the bare minimum you can
[01:31:48.660 --> 01:31:54.900]  do is sign up for the free newsletter at infowords.com forward slash newsletter.
[01:31:54.900 --> 01:31:57.900]  We are the Renaissance and we are winning.
[01:31:57.900 --> 01:32:03.860]  We are kept afloat only by your loyal patronage and that's why we need you to go to the site
[01:32:03.860 --> 01:32:08.900]  now, if you're not in the market for one of our greatest nutraceuticals, please consider
[01:32:08.900 --> 01:32:18.060]  a contribution, 25, 50, 100, 250 or even $500 would be a godsend to our important work here
[01:32:18.060 --> 01:32:23.620]  to beat back the globalists and to destroy their campaign of censorship in which they
[01:32:23.620 --> 01:32:53.580]  want to strangle our first amendment rights.
[01:32:53.580 --> 01:33:18.820]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:33:18.820 --> 01:33:39.340]  If you know there's a giant worldwide syndicate that uses pedophilia and child murder as its
[01:33:39.340 --> 01:33:45.900]  initiation and you did nothing about it, you would be aiding and abetting that, wouldn't
[01:33:45.900 --> 01:33:46.900]  you?
[01:33:46.900 --> 01:33:52.820]  It's all over the news now, but it's like, oh, Alex Jones wasn't right about that 20
[01:33:52.820 --> 01:33:55.020]  something years ago, exactly what he said, right?
[01:33:55.020 --> 01:34:01.860]  No, he's the bad person and let's have hundreds and hundreds, thousands some days of articles
[01:34:01.860 --> 01:34:04.100]  lying and twisting at every level.
[01:34:04.100 --> 01:34:08.260]  Now, again, I don't want to make about Alex Jones, but they make it about that because
[01:34:08.260 --> 01:34:09.860]  of what we're covering.
[01:34:09.860 --> 01:34:11.420]  They're so scared of it.
[01:34:11.420 --> 01:34:21.220]  Now, yesterday at about 2.30, we get an email from ZD net and several others saying your
[01:34:21.220 --> 01:34:35.060]  site info store.com appears to have been hacked and it happened like 15 hours ago and a computer
[01:34:35.060 --> 01:34:38.060]  science group found it out of the Netherlands.
[01:34:38.060 --> 01:34:44.820]  Now, out of all the horrible articles written about this, this is the most accurate because
[01:34:44.820 --> 01:34:47.420]  the tech writer mainly just writes about the actual hacks.
[01:34:47.420 --> 01:34:52.380]  Now, it turns out at any one time, one out of five shopping carts is infected with these.
[01:34:52.380 --> 01:34:59.580]  They go on to say that this top firm was scanning our site for three and a half years every day.
[01:34:59.580 --> 01:35:04.020]  They don't do that to other people looking for vulnerabilities.
[01:35:04.020 --> 01:35:14.360]  This big computer science security guru group was just lovingly out of the Netherlands.
[01:35:14.360 --> 01:35:19.220]  It says in ZD net scanning the site and said never found any vulnerabilities, which they
[01:35:19.220 --> 01:35:21.260]  admits pretty rare.
[01:35:21.260 --> 01:35:27.340]  No vulnerabilities scanning info wars, news wars, info war store.com is looking, looking,
[01:35:27.340 --> 01:35:31.660]  and then magically, magically.
[01:35:31.660 --> 01:35:37.580]  Then got in, I'm not supposed to say how, and the way they did this is only government
[01:35:37.580 --> 01:35:46.140]  actors would have this because they didn't get in through info wars.
[01:35:46.140 --> 01:35:48.740]  We were told might have gotten some customer data.
[01:35:48.740 --> 01:35:57.180]  Well, we decoded it, unscramble it, and have some big tech firms look at it who we have
[01:35:57.180 --> 01:36:01.580]  as consultants and they said, yeah, it has to be to an encrypted point.
[01:36:01.580 --> 01:36:03.860]  It wasn't even sent to an encrypted point.
[01:36:03.860 --> 01:36:10.580]  The sophistication is how they got the password to put the bad code in.
[01:36:10.580 --> 01:36:19.620]  But that code then really wasn't even getting anything.
[01:36:19.620 --> 01:36:27.580]  And then sending it to a place that's not even designed to be able to grab it.
[01:36:27.580 --> 01:36:32.460]  And so 100%, three different companies we've talked to that looked at it, said definitely
[01:36:32.460 --> 01:36:34.580]  done to embarrass you.
[01:36:34.580 --> 01:36:38.500]  Definitely done, not like the other ones where they put the scanners on to grab the data.
[01:36:38.500 --> 01:36:44.020]  When you go to the gas station or you go to Amazon, it's happened to everybody.
[01:36:44.020 --> 01:36:47.780]  Never happened to info wars.
[01:36:47.780 --> 01:36:52.460]  Once for prisonplanet.tv, it was an exploit and they were able to get names, but not the
[01:36:52.460 --> 01:36:53.460]  credit card numbers.
[01:36:53.460 --> 01:36:54.700]  We told folks about that.
[01:36:54.700 --> 01:37:01.900]  So this is what happens in the digital world, but the big story is we sent a statement,
[01:37:01.900 --> 01:37:07.100]  put it on info wars, and then they had a bunch of big newspapers say that we made it up and
[01:37:07.100 --> 01:37:11.500]  that it didn't happen.
[01:37:11.500 --> 01:37:15.260]  And then the very same publications came out and made fun of us when it was admitted to
[01:37:15.260 --> 01:37:18.340]  have happened and said, oh, you think it's a conspiracy.
[01:37:18.340 --> 01:37:25.020]  What's someone engaging in a felony action who couldn't get through the systems we have
[01:37:25.020 --> 01:37:27.580]  as we know we're targets.
[01:37:27.580 --> 01:37:33.060]  And so they were able to do stuff that you'd only be able to do if you have a government
[01:37:33.060 --> 01:37:36.100]  database and back doors.
[01:37:36.100 --> 01:37:40.820]  The piece of hardware, the program to steal the data was crap.
[01:37:40.820 --> 01:37:45.380]  That's why we can about 100% say no data was gotten.
[01:37:45.380 --> 01:37:53.820]  It wasn't being sent somewhere where it could be decoded.
[01:37:53.820 --> 01:37:56.900]  It was purely done to embarrass us and act like we're somewhere not safe to go shop.
[01:37:56.900 --> 01:37:57.900]  That's admitted.
[01:37:57.900 --> 01:38:00.260]  And the media shows that the day running with that, don't go there.
[01:38:00.260 --> 01:38:01.260]  It's all fake.
[01:38:01.260 --> 01:38:02.260]  It's still right there.
[01:38:02.260 --> 01:38:03.260]  Alex Jones is behind it.
[01:38:03.260 --> 01:38:04.260]  He did it.
[01:38:04.260 --> 01:38:05.260]  Oh, oh.
[01:38:05.260 --> 01:38:07.180]  They can't take our payment processors all the way.
[01:38:07.180 --> 01:38:08.980]  They haven't been able to sue us out of existence.
[01:38:08.980 --> 01:38:11.820]  This is the next thing.
[01:38:11.820 --> 01:38:19.980]  And so magically, less than 24 hours after it gets on there, we get a call and get told
[01:38:19.980 --> 01:38:23.860]  by the big security firm in the Netherlands and by ZDNet that this is what happened and
[01:38:23.860 --> 01:38:27.780]  we go look and it's not even true.
[01:38:27.780 --> 01:38:30.220]  But they know we have a responsibility to come tell you.
[01:38:30.220 --> 01:38:40.700]  And they used this software, this virus, this malware, to go out and get into a bunch of
[01:38:40.700 --> 01:38:42.100]  other big systems.
[01:38:42.100 --> 01:38:49.220]  But what they admit is sophisticated is how they got the password, which I'm not going
[01:38:49.220 --> 01:38:52.140]  to get into on air, but let's just say this.
[01:38:52.140 --> 01:38:53.980]  No one knew who had it.
[01:38:53.980 --> 01:38:55.620]  No one knew what state they were in.
[01:38:55.620 --> 01:39:01.100]  No one knew what company it was, except the CIA and all these groups grab everything.
[01:39:01.100 --> 01:39:02.580]  The Chai comms grab everything.
[01:39:02.580 --> 01:39:06.540]  They've got chips and everything, all the passcodes, Google cars drive around and steal
[01:39:06.540 --> 01:39:07.540]  your passcodes.
[01:39:07.540 --> 01:39:09.940]  That was admitted 15 years ago, 10 years ago.
[01:39:09.940 --> 01:39:14.180]  They've been, you know about hacking, it's ubiquitous.
[01:39:14.180 --> 01:39:15.180]  None of it's safe.
[01:39:15.180 --> 01:39:17.380]  The tech companies all have it.
[01:39:17.380 --> 01:39:19.180]  They've all got AI now watching.
[01:39:19.180 --> 01:39:21.380]  They know what fake purchases are.
[01:39:21.380 --> 01:39:23.180]  That's why you get the calls and you get the alerts.
[01:39:23.180 --> 01:39:27.020]  So this is purely a Psyop to do this.
[01:39:27.020 --> 01:39:37.220]  And you read these articles, they're dripping with hatred and also really incredible defamation
[01:39:37.220 --> 01:39:40.100]  that's meant to bankrupt us and destroy our speech.
[01:39:40.100 --> 01:39:50.540]  I mean this one article here out of Fast Company says, Jones's supplements might kill you.
[01:39:50.540 --> 01:39:52.380]  No proof, no link, no nothing.
[01:39:52.380 --> 01:39:57.340]  Just, you know, you're not just taking your financial life in your hands, you're physical
[01:39:57.340 --> 01:39:58.340]  life.
[01:39:58.340 --> 01:40:00.540]  You could die.
[01:40:00.540 --> 01:40:03.020]  Who authorizes groups to write stuff like that?
[01:40:03.020 --> 01:40:06.380]  We would win a lawsuit there.
[01:40:06.380 --> 01:40:07.380]  They don't care.
[01:40:07.380 --> 01:40:08.380]  They're going for broke.
[01:40:08.380 --> 01:40:10.380]  It's all part of this climate of criminality.
[01:40:10.380 --> 01:40:17.100]  And it goes on and says he is the evil destination on the web and the known, you know, bad guy
[01:40:17.100 --> 01:40:20.780]  and infamous and he sells scam products.
[01:40:20.780 --> 01:40:24.340]  They even have the Washington Post saying I sell scam products.
[01:40:24.340 --> 01:40:29.300]  When I sell about 10 of our products, our private label top of the line that we're sold
[01:40:29.300 --> 01:40:31.420]  at Whole Foods and are still sold there.
[01:40:31.420 --> 01:40:32.420]  I go out.
[01:40:32.420 --> 01:40:33.420]  What's the highest tested?
[01:40:33.420 --> 01:40:34.420]  What's the best?
[01:40:34.420 --> 01:40:39.740]  We buy it from that company, private label it, same company provides Whole Foods with
[01:40:39.740 --> 01:40:45.020]  their top of the line premium rents and ours are about 10, 15% less usually.
[01:40:45.020 --> 01:40:50.300]  Oh, Jeff Bezos can have Amazon, the biggest seller in the world of supplements and he
[01:40:50.300 --> 01:40:55.100]  can have Whole Foods and he can have the perfect credit rating and all the rest of it.
[01:40:55.100 --> 01:40:58.140]  But when I sell supplements, it's bad.
[01:40:58.140 --> 01:40:59.140]  It's evil.
[01:40:59.140 --> 01:41:00.980]  It's not allowed.
[01:41:00.980 --> 01:41:07.340]  When you read these articles, you would think that I was the Pope protecting Chalmolesters
[01:41:07.340 --> 01:41:11.500]  as he did two days ago saying no more investigation of Chalmolesters, you know, it's gay, you're
[01:41:11.500 --> 01:41:14.420]  lucky you got raped is what he's basically saying now.
[01:41:14.420 --> 01:41:16.100]  He tells people, I was raped.
[01:41:16.100 --> 01:41:17.100]  I know my son.
[01:41:17.100 --> 01:41:18.100]  It's okay.
[01:41:18.100 --> 01:41:19.660]  You like it.
[01:41:19.660 --> 01:41:20.660]  You like to be raped.
[01:41:20.660 --> 01:41:21.660]  I'm good for you.
[01:41:21.660 --> 01:41:22.660]  Good.
[01:41:22.660 --> 01:41:23.660]  There you go.
[01:41:23.660 --> 01:41:24.660]  Take your sacrament.
[01:41:24.660 --> 01:41:25.660]  You'll take it.
[01:41:25.660 --> 01:41:26.660]  You'll take it.
[01:41:26.660 --> 01:41:28.660]  Well, you know what you're going to take.
[01:41:28.660 --> 01:41:30.260]  You're lucky you weren't cut up in pieces.
[01:41:30.260 --> 01:41:31.260]  That's what I do.
[01:41:31.260 --> 01:41:33.100]  I like to kill people, not to rape them.
[01:41:33.100 --> 01:41:35.500]  The blood, the actual essence is what I enjoy.
[01:41:35.500 --> 01:41:36.500]  Bathing in it.
[01:41:36.500 --> 01:41:37.500]  All the pleasures.
[01:41:37.500 --> 01:41:38.500]  Eating poop.
[01:41:38.500 --> 01:41:40.180]  He always talks about eating poop a lot.
[01:41:40.180 --> 01:41:41.180]  He's obsessed with that.
[01:41:41.180 --> 01:41:44.060]  He said that my website is like eating poop.
[01:41:44.060 --> 01:41:46.540]  He says, the weird, big, fake news is being banned.
[01:41:46.540 --> 01:41:47.620]  That's a good thing.
[01:41:47.620 --> 01:41:52.100]  That man over in America, he likes to, he's teaching people to eat poop.
[01:41:52.100 --> 01:41:54.940]  The word is you like eating poop.
[01:41:54.940 --> 01:41:56.180]  Pontiff.
[01:41:56.180 --> 01:41:58.140]  The poop eating pontiff.
[01:41:58.140 --> 01:41:59.140]  The poop stir.
[01:41:59.140 --> 01:42:02.780]  I'm not kidding.
[01:42:02.780 --> 01:42:07.380]  People can't believe that, but oh, his, his, his, his deputy pope, a hundred plus traffic
[01:42:07.380 --> 01:42:13.300]  little boys, some of which were found dead.
[01:42:13.300 --> 01:42:14.300]  There it is.
[01:42:14.300 --> 01:42:16.700]  Pope Francis compares the assumption of fake news to eating feces.
[01:42:16.700 --> 01:42:19.020]  Who even thinks about stuff like that?
[01:42:19.020 --> 01:42:20.540]  Well, he does.
[01:42:20.540 --> 01:42:25.100]  So, there you go.
[01:42:25.100 --> 01:42:26.820]  Looks like nothing was gotten.
[01:42:26.820 --> 01:42:32.180]  They just put a hack on there so they could then tell everybody and report on it and say,
[01:42:32.180 --> 01:42:33.180]  don't go to M-Full Wars.
[01:42:33.180 --> 01:42:37.820]  And a lot of these headlines are like, Jones got caught running credit card scammers.
[01:42:37.820 --> 01:42:38.820]  Yeah.
[01:42:38.820 --> 01:42:39.820]  What won't he do next?
[01:42:39.820 --> 01:42:41.060]  I don't know.
[01:42:41.060 --> 01:42:43.500]  He lied and said that across the video happened too.
[01:42:43.500 --> 01:42:45.860]  You all saw it did, but it didn't.
[01:42:45.860 --> 01:42:47.540]  This is total war.
[01:42:47.540 --> 01:42:48.540]  M-FullWarsStore.com.

[01:44:03.260 --> 01:44:04.660]  Life.

[01:44:09.820 --> 01:44:16.100]  formulated prebiotic fiber, a mixture of clinically studied and organic acacia, fruit,
[01:44:16.100 --> 01:44:18.100]  and flax fiber.
[01:44:18.100 --> 01:44:23.260]  Prebiotic fiber is soluble fiber that ferments in the gut to help feed good bacteria, which
[01:44:23.260 --> 01:44:28.860]  helps you digest food, absorb nutrients, and even support your immune system.
[01:44:28.860 --> 01:44:33.780]  Infowars Life's cutting-edge formula only brings you the highest quality, organic, and
[01:44:33.780 --> 01:44:36.220]  clinically studied ingredients.
[01:44:36.220 --> 01:44:41.180]  Cheap prebiotic fibers are used up only at the beginning of the colon, but our premium
[01:44:41.180 --> 01:44:48.060]  organic acacia fiber is slowly digested by the good bacteria throughout the entire colon
[01:44:48.060 --> 01:44:50.740]  for maximum prebiotic effect.
[01:44:50.740 --> 01:44:58.060]  Head to InfowarsLife.com or call 1-888-253-3139.
[01:44:58.060 --> 01:45:02.100]  The globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment
[01:45:02.100 --> 01:45:07.340]  full of the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromine, you name it, that it lowers IQ, it
[01:45:07.340 --> 01:45:10.220]  literally dumbs the population down.
[01:45:10.220 --> 01:45:14.380]  And on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers the best iodide in the world, we've
[01:45:14.380 --> 01:45:16.380]  gone through two permutations.
[01:45:16.380 --> 01:45:21.260]  The first seaweed-based iodine that was pretty good, but hard to source, and the globalists
[01:45:21.260 --> 01:45:25.900]  tried to block us getting a supply of it, so we discovered deep-earth crystals of pure
[01:45:25.900 --> 01:45:28.060]  nascent iodine and brought you X2.
[01:45:28.060 --> 01:45:29.060]  That's been incredible.
[01:45:29.060 --> 01:45:34.460]  Now, due to the establishment trying to block that, we did more research and secured more
[01:45:34.460 --> 01:45:39.180]  of the deep-earth crystals of nascent iodine, but chemists, scientists, and others showed
[01:45:39.180 --> 01:45:44.180]  us the research that by combining it with three other compounds, two forms of iodine
[01:45:44.180 --> 01:45:50.580]  and vitamin C, it supercharges it and makes it even more bioavailable.
[01:45:50.580 --> 01:45:53.780]  Ladies and gentlemen, you want to research it, you want to see it, it's an incredible
[01:45:53.780 --> 01:45:54.780]  discovery.

[01:47:01.220 --> 01:47:18.440]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:18.440 --> 01:47:29.720]  the craziest thing. When the words went out that infowarfstore.com had supposedly been
[01:47:29.720 --> 01:47:36.920]  hacked yesterday, sales weren't very good. Days before that, sales went up about 40%.
[01:47:36.920 --> 01:47:51.920]  Our listeners really get it. Think about that. And then we find out it is such a sophisticated hack
[01:47:51.920 --> 01:48:04.000]  to get into it, but it's fetched. They didn't commit the other crime of actually getting real data.
[01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:10.880]  They just put it on there and then sent it into a black hole encrypted because it is encrypted.
[01:48:10.880 --> 01:48:18.520]  So they could say that we were letting people have their information stolen so they could
[01:48:18.520 --> 01:48:29.280]  write all these articles. Yeah, they say it best and they say nothing at all. These people are
[01:48:29.280 --> 01:48:39.560]  unbelievable. And every angle, Jones is lying, there wasn't a possible hack. Though he is,
[01:48:39.560 --> 01:48:45.080]  and he says it's a conspiracy, a sophisticated international hacking group, that's what it says,
[01:48:45.080 --> 01:48:50.880]  breaks in and tries to steal data, and I say there's a conspiracy. You know, me and my buddy
[01:48:50.880 --> 01:48:56.280]  decided to rob our neighbor's house when they're out of town. That's a conspiracy. Oh, but when
[01:48:56.280 --> 01:49:01.080]  governments are involved, it's like saying they're going to move towards saying the nation state
[01:49:01.080 --> 01:49:06.200]  is illegal and bad and racist and needs to be gotten rid of. I've been saying that for 20-plus
[01:49:06.200 --> 01:49:09.800]  years because that's what the globalists said in their own documents. Now it's all over TV.
[01:49:09.800 --> 01:49:14.880]  Trump's evil. There is no such thing as America. America is bad. Take a knee for the American flag.
[01:49:14.880 --> 01:49:20.200]  It's evil. Get rid of all of it. Take down all the statues. And nation states need to be gotten
[01:49:20.200 --> 01:49:26.120]  rid of. And Macron says patriotism is getting rid of the nation state and handing it over to
[01:49:26.120 --> 01:49:33.560]  an unelected, tyrannical EU, UN, world government. And that's who runs the EU borders and that's
[01:49:33.560 --> 01:49:38.040]  who was running our borders till Trump got in. And the number of illegals coming across being
[01:49:38.040 --> 01:49:46.840]  caught is up fourfold. And that's about the number of increase trying to get across. 400% it went up
[01:49:49.080 --> 01:49:55.560]  200 plus percent for much of Obama's deal. So it's just exponentially going like a Saturn rocket
[01:49:55.560 --> 01:50:02.360]  straight up. But remember, oh, they're all children. Oh, they're all walking. Only about
[01:50:02.360 --> 01:50:08.680]  two percent are children. 80 plus percent are military age men. Oh, the UN isn't funding them.
[01:50:08.680 --> 01:50:14.600]  There's no NGOs allowed. Fire Lou Dobbs, fire Tucker Carlson publicly funded by the UN with
[01:50:14.600 --> 01:50:19.160]  US taxpayer money and run by George Soros. I mean, we have video. I didn't even play
[01:50:19.160 --> 01:50:26.600]  that Laura Southern got undercover. That's NGOs. And it's the first one they go in. I was just
[01:50:26.600 --> 01:50:31.000]  talking to the reporter that actually shot it today. When you get them on the way, I forgot to
[01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:34.520]  tell you that, Daria. They're like, why don't you have a song? We're the ones that shot this and
[01:50:34.520 --> 01:50:38.280]  roll over international news. I'm like, I know. That's a great job talking to them this morning.
[01:50:38.280 --> 01:50:42.680]  But literally, you just go into one refugee thing and it's like, we will bring down Europe.
[01:50:42.680 --> 01:50:47.320]  Islam shall dominate. The women will be yours. And it's a European woman telling them this,
[01:50:47.320 --> 01:50:52.440]  this is their mission. And you tell them you're Christians, even though you've tasted Christian
[01:50:52.440 --> 01:50:59.880]  blood. I mean, it's like, we will feast on their skulls. Like the Imam of Jerusalem.
[01:51:00.920 --> 01:51:06.120]  The Europeans are weak. We have bought their leaders. The women are good. We will have them all
[01:51:06.120 --> 01:51:12.440]  soon. Their churches will now be masked. We will control the animals. Europe is ours.
[01:51:12.440 --> 01:51:18.440]  The dogs will learn to serve us as our women serve us.
[01:51:21.800 --> 01:51:27.000]  He actually talks like that. We play the clip again for it. And then the Swiss and,
[01:51:27.640 --> 01:51:34.600]  you know, stand against it and they're bad. But the Dutch and the French and the Swedes,
[01:51:34.600 --> 01:51:39.720]  they're all just like, come in. Oh, you're allowed to rape court after court and said,
[01:51:39.720 --> 01:51:43.880]  you did rape a nine year old girl, but that's your culture. It's okay. Oh, you 10 of you
[01:51:43.880 --> 01:51:48.200]  raped a little 12 year old girl and then killed her six months in jail. Don't do it again.
[01:51:49.160 --> 01:51:56.280]  You only murdered her. She begged for mommy, but it's okay because it's Islamic. That's kind of cool.
[01:51:58.040 --> 01:52:02.440]  Meanwhile, they're all fleeing their hell pit countries. Their population is doubling
[01:52:03.160 --> 01:52:09.000]  in the next 15 years to three plus billion. It's at 1.8 billion. Now they're literally
[01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:15.240]  the West is weak. We have bought the leaders. We are in command. It is under Islam's directive
[01:52:15.240 --> 01:52:21.640]  that all of those done under our rule are the enemy. Invade them to save them, rape them,
[01:52:21.640 --> 01:52:27.240]  women, kill them and murder them all. Hail Soros. Hail the UN. Hail Hillary.
[01:52:27.240 --> 01:52:42.600]  There's videos going, Miracle, we love you. Miracle, we love you. Meanwhile, back in America,
[01:52:43.640 --> 01:52:47.880]  we're going to learn about the really bad people. Oh, not the Washington post hacks of
[01:52:47.880 --> 01:52:52.680]  office of personnel management databases, compromises 22.1 million people. Their social
[01:52:52.680 --> 01:52:57.560]  security numbers, their names, their families, intelligence operations, everything given by Obama
[01:52:57.560 --> 01:53:06.440]  to the Chinese. But that's not a problem. That's that's Oh, but Alex Jones card skimming malware
[01:53:06.440 --> 01:53:15.640]  removed from info wars online store. And ZD net gets someone accurate says less than 1,600 users
[01:53:15.640 --> 01:53:23.480]  affected. We suggest they looks like almost no one had any credit card info taken. And then
[01:53:23.480 --> 01:53:32.440]  now we've decoded it. And we can't find any data. And it was being sent to an insecure server. So
[01:53:32.440 --> 01:53:38.760]  it wouldn't even be able to un encrypt it. It's literally been done. This is what the tech experts
[01:53:38.760 --> 01:53:45.000]  have told me. They said, no, this has been done to say your site's not safe. All the other times
[01:53:45.000 --> 01:53:49.480]  they put this stuff on, you know, they point it at a real place to try to get the info. And then
[01:53:49.480 --> 01:53:54.760]  they try to un encrypt it. That's not what happened here. It was just put there by an incredibly
[01:53:54.760 --> 01:53:59.880]  sophisticated hack. I mean, the way they did this was you got to be surveilling people to do stuff
[01:53:59.880 --> 01:54:06.120]  like this. Okay. And my point is, is they think you're so timid that and you know, this is how
[01:54:06.680 --> 01:54:10.760]  it says here, it's one of his last ways to get funded as we work to take him off the air.
[01:54:10.760 --> 01:54:16.920]  But the scumbag filth has supporters that buy the scam products. You got like high quality
[01:54:16.920 --> 01:54:21.800]  water filters and t-shirts and books and fluoride free toothpaste, you know, evil stuff like that
[01:54:21.800 --> 01:54:27.480]  and multivitamin mix for children and high quality, highest rated fish oil and 95%
[01:54:28.280 --> 01:54:34.600]  tracheminoid with nobody else even know has the very best turmeric. Oh, so evil. Oh, so bad. Rated
[01:54:34.600 --> 01:54:41.320]  by third party sites on average of 4.9 stars. But again, they think you're morons. They think
[01:54:41.320 --> 01:54:45.640]  I'm a moron and you read these articles. It's not, it's not even about info wars. It's about the
[01:54:45.640 --> 01:54:52.920]  line. Listen to this out of fast company info wars. It mits, it stored, it stored, contained card
[01:54:52.920 --> 01:54:58.920]  skimming malware. That's to make it sound like I did this or on purpose. All you people out there
[01:54:58.920 --> 01:55:05.960]  buying up the macho supplements, the conspiracy macho man of bad macho, the conspiracy theorist
[01:55:05.960 --> 01:55:13.400]  extraordinaire. Alex Jones talks may have that intentionally imperiled your dad. Oh,
[01:55:13.400 --> 01:55:17.080]  that the globalist steel and they all share with everybody. And this is actually just made up,
[01:55:17.080 --> 01:55:23.880]  but he doesn't matter. A Dutch security researcher, big firm found magically before a day even passed.
[01:55:23.880 --> 01:55:26.440]  They said they were scanning us for three and a half years trying to find something.
[01:55:26.440 --> 01:55:33.240]  He actually says that in a Z net story. A Dutch security researcher found malware on info war
[01:55:33.240 --> 01:55:40.520]  store. Oh, right away. That was able to record user payment records. And that's not true. We can
[01:55:40.520 --> 01:55:45.960]  now tell you today. Researcher William De Groot reportedly found the malware infection
[01:55:46.840 --> 01:55:51.720]  about two days ago. He discovered it using a scanner. He built, that's not even true. It wasn't
[01:55:51.720 --> 01:55:58.200]  two days ago to detect any sort of information info wars about the issue and the site says it
[01:55:58.200 --> 01:56:04.680]  fixed. So again, he discovered it using a scanner built to detect any sort of bad behavior happening
[01:56:04.680 --> 01:56:09.800]  atop the Magento e-commerce platform. Z net informed info wars about the issue and the site
[01:56:09.800 --> 01:56:14.600]  says it's fixed. Alex Jones told the news that only about 1600 customers may have been affected.
[01:56:14.600 --> 01:56:19.400]  Then Magento scan the site when we left the stuff on there to see it and said that's not even there
[01:56:19.400 --> 01:56:24.760]  and that's not even a security issue. This is fake. Really fake news with fake news. The info
[01:56:24.760 --> 01:56:33.400]  war store is an infamous digital destination known for selling products that promise vague things
[01:56:33.400 --> 01:56:38.360]  like male vitality, alpha power in the real red pill. As courts pointed out, these products,
[01:56:38.360 --> 01:56:43.640]  which generally are herbal solvents that have not been proven to have any, no, the FDA won't let you
[01:56:43.640 --> 01:56:51.800]  say that without oxygen you die or that without vitamin C you die or that without without iodine
[01:56:51.800 --> 01:56:56.760]  you die and your IQ goes down before that happens. No, that's not. See just lie stacked online
[01:56:58.200 --> 01:57:04.360]  and it goes on over the last year. The podcast on video show, which has been known for disseminating
[01:57:04.360 --> 01:57:09.640]  all sorts of conspiracy theories have been deep platform. Oh, that's good. Yeah. We don't, you
[01:57:09.640 --> 01:57:13.480]  don't question anything. Alex Jones was banned from Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, Apple, Spotify,
[01:57:13.480 --> 01:57:19.000]  PayPal, as well as other sites and the tech backlashes reportedly led to the audience cratering,
[01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:23.800]  which isn't even true. Even Amazon, a company known for refusing to be political stand,
[01:57:23.800 --> 01:57:28.760]  stopped recommending enforced products. You had that five stars and it just goes on for page after
[01:57:28.760 --> 01:57:35.080]  page of disinfo and garbage. This is the cowardly sellouts piling on with their lies so angry that
[01:57:35.080 --> 01:57:39.800]  you financially support us all getting great products. There's only four days left against 67%
[01:57:39.800 --> 01:57:44.600]  off on silver bullet colloidal silver. They sell for like $25 at Whole Foods. It's the same stuff,
[01:57:44.600 --> 01:57:49.880]  $9.95 and a bunch of other big specials. In Full Wars Life is launching its newest product. We're
[01:57:49.880 --> 01:57:57.320]  really, really proud of it. It's a best source prebiotic fiber and it's got the very best
[01:57:57.320 --> 01:58:03.640]  concentrated fibers from berries and fruits and other compounds that have been known to be the
[01:58:03.640 --> 01:58:08.680]  very best for your body and for regularity and so much more. And it synergistically works with our
[01:58:08.680 --> 01:58:15.400]  50 billion live active culture for a life as well as Myco ZX that targets the yeast, the mold, and
[01:58:15.400 --> 01:58:20.680]  the funguses in the gut. So this is the time to take advantage of getting this new incredible fiber
[01:58:20.680 --> 01:58:25.240]  product and these other products. You get them separately or together and make really, really
[01:58:25.240 --> 01:58:29.320]  big savings and get high quality products at the same time. And I'm doing this to introduce
[01:58:29.320 --> 01:58:36.120]  these products to you. Bodies sold out in a month. A strongest concentrated turmeric formula we can
[01:58:36.120 --> 01:58:41.320]  come up with. It's sold out for another month and a half. We sold it at 50% off till it's sold out.
[01:58:41.880 --> 01:58:46.920]  And I think it's going to be the same way with this fiber. Get yours today, infowarslife.com.
[01:58:52.280 --> 01:58:57.560]  Years ago, Info Wars Life created the powerful Myco ZX formula to help you combat internal
[01:58:57.560 --> 01:59:02.360]  yeast. As the years went on and more toxins were pumped into the environment, our team knew we
[01:59:02.360 --> 01:59:07.640]  had to create a bigger and better formula to help support your gut health. Myco ZX Plus is the result
[01:59:07.640 --> 01:59:12.440]  of the search for that formula, a unique natural formula designed to support the body's natural
[01:59:12.440 --> 01:59:17.240]  cleansing of yeast and fungal organisms. There's no better product to help your body fight back.
[01:59:17.240 --> 01:59:22.520]  Myco ZX Plus helps support a healthy microbial balance in the body, supports your digestive tract
[01:59:22.520 --> 01:59:27.080]  and addresses the intestinal yeast that can cause you problems if it goes unchecked. Powered by an
[01:59:27.080 --> 01:59:31.960]  impressive list of ingredients, including grapefruit seed extract, pal-darko bark, and grape seed
[01:59:31.960 --> 01:59:37.080]  extract, our formula is fueled by ingredients that stood the test of time as powerful micro
[01:59:37.080 --> 01:59:43.080]  balancing properties. Pick up a bottle of the new and improved Myco ZX Plus today at infowarslife.com.
[01:59:43.080 --> 01:59:44.840]  That's infowarslife.com.
[01:59:44.840 --> 01:59:53.320]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:00:03.160 --> 02:00:09.560]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign, and domestic. It's Alex Jones.
[02:00:09.560 --> 02:00:20.920]  All right, so finishing up on the so-called hack, we're still going to warn the 1600 people or so
[02:00:21.720 --> 02:00:27.560]  that may have had some information in a screen-scraped grab. But again, the way it's going out,
[02:00:27.560 --> 02:00:31.640]  the way it was encrypted, very, very low probability of that. But the issue is,
[02:00:31.640 --> 02:00:40.760]  normally, these hacks go on for years. What was it? 88 million Yahoo financial accounts that got
[02:00:41.720 --> 02:00:47.880]  exposed over, what, five, six years? 22 million plus U.S. government employees, their families,
[02:00:47.880 --> 02:00:54.280]  everything scraped. That went on for years. This happens for less than one day. And magically,
[02:00:54.280 --> 02:01:01.800]  the media is notified about it. So again, everything points towards it being put on there
[02:01:03.240 --> 02:01:07.720]  so they could engage in economic sabotage and just try to embarrass us. And you read
[02:01:07.720 --> 02:01:11.160]  these sickening articles. This is just one of them that I'm giving a flavor for. Then we're
[02:01:11.160 --> 02:01:19.400]  going to go back to break and come back with our special guest. They go on here in this
[02:01:19.400 --> 02:01:26.520]  fast-company article to tell you what they're really going for here. It would seem that selling
[02:01:26.520 --> 02:01:33.640]  products directly on the site is one of the only reliable ways for Jones to bring in revenue. And
[02:01:33.640 --> 02:01:42.440]  now, it seems, even that was hampered. For now, Jones tells ZDNet the problem is fixed. So instead
[02:01:42.440 --> 02:01:51.560]  of chancing their data privacy, those buying InfoWars products are merely putting their bodily
[02:01:51.560 --> 02:02:00.680]  health at risk. And that's what the average article is like. I'm a criminal. I'm scum.
[02:02:01.640 --> 02:02:07.560]  I'm ripping you off. You could get hurt taking my products. I've got this shoddy shopping cart
[02:02:07.560 --> 02:02:13.400]  that's got this malware on it, and this is all going on. Meanwhile, one in five shopping carts
[02:02:13.400 --> 02:02:17.640]  at any one time is infected with this stuff. We have a bunch of big companies, people watching
[02:02:17.640 --> 02:02:25.480]  it. They scanned it, said, yeah, it's not there because it was put into code so that they could
[02:02:25.480 --> 02:02:30.040]  point at it and say, don't shop with Alex Jones. And then we knew what the articles would be.
[02:02:30.040 --> 02:02:33.800]  Don't shop with him. They're everywhere trying to take our payment processors away.
[02:02:33.800 --> 02:02:38.840]  They're everywhere trying to bankrupt us and shut us down so we can't stand up for the Republic
[02:02:39.560 --> 02:02:46.840]  and basic freedom. And now this. Again, most tax go for months, sometimes years of this type.
[02:02:48.520 --> 02:02:55.160]  But magically, the hack came out of the Netherlands and then Lithuania,
[02:02:55.160 --> 02:03:00.040]  supposedly you can bounce it from anywhere. But thank goodness, security researchers in the
[02:03:00.040 --> 02:03:05.400]  Netherlands caught it pretty much instantly when it started happening and then reported to the media
[02:03:06.280 --> 02:03:10.440]  so that we could get it fixed. We're really, very thankful to the folks over in the Netherlands,
[02:03:11.400 --> 02:03:17.720]  whatever's going on here. But this is classic. If you go to the Vault 7 that WikiLeaks released,
[02:03:19.160 --> 02:03:24.360]  it's the leftist inside the CIA, not the whole agency and other intelligence agencies,
[02:03:24.360 --> 02:03:30.280]  had tools way beyond all this and how to frame people, how to do fake hacks to the discredit
[02:03:30.280 --> 02:03:35.800]  people. And it's an exact way to do this. And folks understand how these operations are run.
[02:03:37.640 --> 02:03:41.800]  This is a reign of terror. And I'm not worried about enforcers. I'm worried about the whole
[02:03:41.800 --> 02:03:48.280]  country and the whole world because the election stealing that's ongoing, the fraud that we're
[02:03:48.280 --> 02:03:54.920]  seeing, the censorship, the calls for overthrowing President Trump and then having civil emergency
[02:03:54.920 --> 02:03:58.040]  and martial law. And then the Democrats run around and say that that's not happening.
[02:03:59.080 --> 02:04:04.920]  And the media says that it is just a new world. Now, we have a special guest joining us to be
[02:04:04.920 --> 02:04:09.960]  a Democrat, but there are some still good Democrats out there. And I've familiar with some of this
[02:04:09.960 --> 02:04:12.600]  work. I haven't read the book yet, but look forward to it. I've heard it's a great book.
[02:04:12.600 --> 02:04:19.880]  Robert Mueller, Aaron Boyd for the New World Order. And we'll talk to John Milkovich when we
[02:04:19.880 --> 02:04:25.480]  come back on the other side. And we're going to get into who Mueller really is and what he's done
[02:04:25.480 --> 02:04:30.920]  in the past, you know, helping whitey bulger carry out hits and murders. That's Mueller's job
[02:04:31.800 --> 02:04:37.080]  transferring uranium to the Russians for Hillary. That's Mueller's job framing people for the
[02:04:37.080 --> 02:04:42.920]  anthrax attacks. That's Mueller's job. He's a really nasty dude. And so we're going to talk to Louisiana
[02:04:42.920 --> 02:04:48.840]  State Senator on the other side about this book. And here's another person that's courage,
[02:04:48.840 --> 02:04:52.200]  because he writes something about this gangster, why they might come at you.
[02:04:56.200 --> 02:05:00.840]  Whether you're looking to boost the benefits of our fish oil formula or just want an alternative,

[02:06:04.040 --> 02:06:14.200]  Live from the infowars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:06:23.000 --> 02:06:26.200]  You know, I really hate tyranny. What about you folks? So,
[02:06:26.200 --> 02:06:36.280]  yesterday we had Roger Stone and we had one of his lawyers on Tyler Nixon and he'd been called
[02:06:36.280 --> 02:06:45.880]  before the grand jury. And there, lo and behold, guess who walks into the room? All secretly,
[02:06:45.880 --> 02:06:50.040]  no one had known because the media's told to not report on it and they follow orders. Guess who
[02:06:50.040 --> 02:06:56.760]  the lead prosecutor is under Mueller? It's Hillary Clinton's personal attack dog lawyer. And you're
[02:06:56.760 --> 02:07:04.280]  like, that's an incredible conflict of interest. That's over the top. Crazy. Why not make Hillary
[02:07:04.280 --> 02:07:09.080]  the judge? Well, why not? I mean, Hillary's talking about running for president again,
[02:07:09.080 --> 02:07:14.200]  because the Republicans have rolled over and let the deep state dims, start stealing all these
[02:07:14.200 --> 02:07:19.000]  elections, so why not? And that's the point of getting it as we've entered a brave new world.
[02:07:19.000 --> 02:07:23.000]  And you know, if you go back 10, 15 years ago, there were Democrats I liked, there were Republicans
[02:07:23.000 --> 02:07:28.360]  I liked. I didn't like Republican blue bloods. I didn't like George Herbert Walker Bush, the
[02:07:28.360 --> 02:07:35.320]  establishment. But now, this is another subject for our guest, the National Democratic Party
[02:07:37.080 --> 02:07:41.640]  led by Hillary Clinton still and Debbie Washington Schultz and Nancy Pelosi just seems to have no
[02:07:41.640 --> 02:07:53.000]  bottom. Now, our guest, John Vilkovich is humbled and honor represent Louisiana Senate District 38.
[02:07:54.120 --> 02:07:58.360]  His priorities of this term include strengthening the Second Amendment, protections defending
[02:07:58.360 --> 02:08:02.840]  traditional marriage, fighting abortion, working to get rid of common core, protecting the right
[02:08:02.840 --> 02:08:07.160]  of citizens, including principal teachers and coaches to express their faith. You're like, wow,
[02:08:07.160 --> 02:08:11.800]  this sounds like Congressman Scalise or something. Well, there are districts where
[02:08:11.800 --> 02:08:15.240]  conservatives have to run as Democrats. That's the secret here. He's passionate about working
[02:08:15.240 --> 02:08:20.440]  to prevent an unfair share of the tax burden from being imposed upon small businesses and
[02:08:20.440 --> 02:08:24.920]  families and senior citizens. He wrote the book Robert Mueller, Aaron Boyd for the New World Order,
[02:08:24.920 --> 02:08:28.600]  in opposition to the witch hunt that has been perpetrated against the president of the United
[02:08:28.600 --> 02:08:33.240]  States, Donald J. Trump. And now they're segueing out of the Russiagate thing as that fraud comes to
[02:08:33.240 --> 02:08:40.920]  a close to Trump shouldn't question these elections. But they're questioning the election of Trump with
[02:08:40.920 --> 02:08:46.200]  no evidence. We have evidence of Broward County, all their places, classically pulling up with
[02:08:46.200 --> 02:08:51.320]  trucks and ringing in ballots illegally and all of this. And the counties had people convicted
[02:08:51.320 --> 02:08:55.560]  doing this over and over again. It's just insane. So there's a lot of things to talk about. But I
[02:08:55.560 --> 02:09:00.520]  guess we should get in the book itself. And who is Robert Mueller? Because this is a window in
[02:09:00.520 --> 02:09:04.760]  to these people. We're all sick of Russiagate, but we're sick of the mainstream media's coverage
[02:09:04.760 --> 02:09:11.560]  of it. Who is Robert Mueller? He's a really bad guy. State Senator, thanks for coming on with us.
[02:09:13.480 --> 02:09:18.280]  What made you decide to write this book? Listen, it's great to be here, Alex. Look,
[02:09:18.280 --> 02:09:23.960]  I think we start with the fact that whether you like him or not or agree or disagree with everything
[02:09:23.960 --> 02:09:31.640]  that he's done, I think the reality is that Donald Trump is an outsider. And Robert Mueller's come
[02:09:31.640 --> 02:09:37.240]  after him tooth and nail, obviously, with an agenda to take him out as part of the deep state.
[02:09:37.240 --> 02:09:42.520]  And I think Dr. Corsi, your good friend, has done a great job saying that there is a plan to take
[02:09:42.520 --> 02:09:47.720]  President Trump out by whatever means, whether ethical or not. And so let's look at Robert
[02:09:47.720 --> 02:09:54.680]  Mueller. Is he a man of the type of moral integrity and character that we can entrust with this
[02:09:54.680 --> 02:10:01.000]  historically and constitutionally monumental task? And the answer is absolutely not. If you look at
[02:10:01.000 --> 02:10:06.840]  his career over a period of 30 years, he's been orchestrating cover up after cover up after cover
[02:10:06.840 --> 02:10:13.240]  up, which is modus operandi. It's persecuting the innocent, letting the guilty go free, covering up
[02:10:13.240 --> 02:10:20.760]  for globalist insiders and high roller international high rollers. And because Donald Trump is an
[02:10:20.760 --> 02:10:26.680]  outsider, because he believes in American sovereignty, because he's standing up for the
[02:10:26.680 --> 02:10:33.240]  preservation of America and fighting against the economic and cultural erosion of America,
[02:10:33.240 --> 02:10:43.560]  of course he is in the sights of Mueller and his globalist directors. Let's get into some of the
[02:10:43.560 --> 02:10:46.600]  book. I mean, I haven't read it yet, but I've scanned over it. And I believe me, I know a lot
[02:10:46.600 --> 02:10:49.400]  more about Mueller than I want to know, but I actually learned some things just just just
[02:10:49.400 --> 02:10:57.560]  recently spent in 10 minutes scanning it over. But this guy is covering up 9 11 and the murder
[02:10:57.560 --> 02:11:03.240]  of John O'Neill. It was a good FBI agent and just everything he does. This guy is super bad news,
[02:11:03.240 --> 02:11:09.720]  BCCI. Let's, let's start and run through the book. Well, thank you, Alex. And by the way,
[02:11:09.720 --> 02:11:14.280]  I really want to thank you for the work that you're doing on behalf of the American public,
[02:11:14.280 --> 02:11:19.800]  on behalf of our republic. I think we all need to be praying for your safety and continued health
[02:11:19.800 --> 02:11:26.920]  and good work. Listen, start, we can start with Whitey Bolger. He's the Irish mafia and not only
[02:11:26.920 --> 02:11:32.440]  was Whitey Bolger operating a reign of terror in Boston, but he was assisted by FBI agents.
[02:11:32.440 --> 02:11:39.960]  Well, who is in the geographic and temporal epicenter of Whitey Bolger FBI's reign of terror?
[02:11:39.960 --> 02:11:45.160]  Robert Mueller, he's either the assistant US attorney or the US attorney from 82 to 87.
[02:11:45.160 --> 02:11:50.840]  What did he do to stop Whitey Bolger or the federal agents that were protecting him? And
[02:11:50.840 --> 02:11:54.840]  according to many, uh, several reporters, they were actually helping Whitey Bolger
[02:11:54.840 --> 02:12:02.040]  commit and cover up murders. White, uh, Robert Mueller did lift a finger, didn't, didn't say a
[02:12:02.040 --> 02:12:06.920]  word, didn't indict anyone, didn't arrest anyone, didn't prosecute anyone, didn't investigate anyone,
[02:12:06.920 --> 02:12:13.640]  didn't even expose anyone. He basically, uh, took a powder so that the FBI and a, uh,
[02:12:13.640 --> 02:12:19.960]  Boston mobster could terrorize the city. Let's move on to Pan Am 103. Pan Am 103 was
[02:12:19.960 --> 02:12:25.720]  according to rank and file CIA agents. I have a closed and shut case. This was a Medjabril
[02:12:25.720 --> 02:12:32.040]  assisted by the Iranians and the Syrians that took out this flight, uh, murdered 270 people.
[02:12:32.680 --> 02:12:38.600]  And, uh, in fact, Robert Bayer, a CIA agent said, look, well, there was not even a question
[02:12:38.600 --> 02:12:43.880]  amongst CIA agents at the time. Said it was unanimous among the rank and file CIA people
[02:12:43.880 --> 02:12:50.120]  that this was a hit that, uh, behind which, uh, in which Iran and Syria were involved. But what
[02:12:50.120 --> 02:12:54.760]  happens is Bush senior says, look, we're going into the Gulf war. We don't want to get Iran and
[02:12:54.760 --> 02:13:01.640]  Syria mad. So let's blame Libya, which here's, let's blame Libya. So they, uh, Alex arrested
[02:13:01.640 --> 02:13:07.480]  two Libyan intelligence officers who had nothing to do with the Pan Am bombing send them, uh,
[02:13:07.480 --> 02:13:11.480]  send one of them to prison. One of them was actually acquitted and who gets, goes free.
[02:13:11.480 --> 02:13:17.960]  A Medjabril goes free. Uh, the international drug ring, CIA sister drug ring is operating with.
[02:13:17.960 --> 02:13:25.000]  And, and by the way, there's CIA fingerprints on the Pan M 103. Uh, there was a U S army major
[02:13:25.000 --> 02:13:31.240]  Charles McKee who was flying from Europe to America to blow the whistle on a CIA drug, uh,
[02:13:31.240 --> 02:13:37.640]  drug assisted, uh, ring that was trafficking heroin into America on December 21st, 1988,
[02:13:37.640 --> 02:13:42.760]  when that plane blew up. So to draw Charles McKee and the investigation by people that,
[02:13:42.760 --> 02:13:48.760]  that the professional investigators into for the Israeli investigative agency, private agency
[02:13:48.760 --> 02:13:56.200]  said that, look, the CIA control gave, uh, the final go ahead for the flight to continue when
[02:13:56.200 --> 02:14:00.280]  officers on the ground could have stopped it. And there goes 270 people. There goes
[02:14:00.280 --> 02:14:04.520]  U S army major, highly decorated major, uh, Charles McKee and his federal agents.
[02:14:04.520 --> 02:14:11.080]  And we're going to blow the whistle on the CIA drug wing. So bottom line, uh, the federal agents
[02:14:11.080 --> 02:14:18.280]  had the, the, the, you know, had the goods on who did that bombing. And because of politics,
[02:14:18.840 --> 02:14:24.760]  uh, the, the, uh, investigation was redirected, rerouted. Who gets brought in to help the cover
[02:14:24.760 --> 02:14:31.000]  up Robert Mueller, let the guilty, first cute the innocent, let the guilty go free. And there
[02:14:31.000 --> 02:14:34.600]  were the CIA, there are CIA fingerprints on that, a major bill. And what was the evidence? And I
[02:14:34.600 --> 02:14:39.560]  want to be brief because I know we have much to cover, but, uh, Alex, there was federal agents
[02:14:39.560 --> 02:14:45.000]  that had intercepted conversations between Iran and a major drill contracting to take out an
[02:14:45.000 --> 02:14:50.120]  American airliner. They had even intercepted the goods that Iran paid your drill a million
[02:14:50.120 --> 02:14:56.520]  before the bombing, 10 million after the bombing. Jabril was bragging about it. His terrorist cell
[02:14:56.520 --> 02:15:00.600]  got caught with bombs about a month or two before the bombing. It was just like the bomb
[02:15:00.600 --> 02:15:05.400]  that was used to take Pan Am 103. Look, this is a closed and shut case for conscientious federal
[02:15:05.400 --> 02:15:09.560]  agents, but instead, uh, they let it happen and Mueller stay right there. We're going to go to
[02:15:09.560 --> 02:15:13.400]  break and come back to this history. Robert Mueller, Aaron Boyle of the new old order with

[02:17:34.920 --> 02:17:38.840]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems

[02:18:06.120 --> 02:18:11.160]  we had like InfoWars stores that just showed our products but they just banned them all yesterday
[02:18:11.160 --> 02:18:15.800]  in punishment that I beat a Trump rally and be mobbed by all these folks that loved us.
[02:18:15.800 --> 02:18:19.560]  Your excitement about America, your excitement about this broadcast is what brought the country
[02:18:19.560 --> 02:18:24.440]  and the world back from the brink. But the globalists now want to target where the resistance
[02:18:24.440 --> 02:18:30.840]  came from so that we're not pesky in the future. I want to be troublesome and pesky. I want to keep
[02:18:30.840 --> 02:18:36.440]  going. I want to make them do the ultimate, not just destroy us financially. I want to push all
[02:18:36.440 --> 02:18:41.240]  the way. I've committed to do that. I've prayed for that and I've been told that's going to happen.
[02:18:41.240 --> 02:18:46.920]  But you've got to back us and I promise you this, I will never falter. I will never waver at the

[02:19:02.600 --> 02:19:07.960]  heck even take your dog for a walk. Believe me, I know I spend hours in front of a screen and then

[02:19:23.560 --> 02:19:29.000]  lifestyle with the screen time and the extended hours, to still have the stamina and endurance,

[02:19:59.640 --> 02:20:02.760]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:20:02.760 --> 02:20:23.400]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones. We're going to get back into
[02:20:23.400 --> 02:20:28.360]  Robert Mueller and his real history, which is public, but most people don't know it,
[02:20:28.360 --> 02:20:33.000]  to understand why he's this operative for the deep state for the Clintons and others and why he's so
[02:20:33.000 --> 02:20:39.320]  dangerous and so arrogant. The prosecutor they're using is Hillary Clinton's attack dog. There's
[02:20:39.320 --> 02:20:45.240]  an article on infowars.com about that right now, but my producer was asking this for a lot of
[02:20:45.240 --> 02:20:48.840]  folks that don't know. You have a very conservative background. You're in Louisiana though. I know
[02:20:48.840 --> 02:20:52.760]  a lot of places you can't get elected as a Republican just the way they gerrymandered things.
[02:20:52.760 --> 02:20:59.000]  So briefly tell folks for a minute or two how you fell down the rabbit hole and why you are
[02:20:59.000 --> 02:21:07.560]  a Democrat. Well, I'll start by saying this. I'm Alex. I'm very disappointed in the lack of
[02:21:07.560 --> 02:21:13.400]  moral compass of many of the national Democrats in Washington, DC. You know, in the old South,
[02:21:13.400 --> 02:21:20.120]  Democrats a generation ago were people that were for a fair shake for working families, believed in
[02:21:20.120 --> 02:21:27.560]  God against abortion and just wanted to work in families to have access to justice and a fair
[02:21:27.560 --> 02:21:35.400]  shake. Unfortunately, the Democratic Party, especially on the national level, has moved
[02:21:35.400 --> 02:21:44.280]  towards atheism, evolution, abortion, amorality taken away or second amendment rights. And perhaps
[02:21:44.280 --> 02:21:49.240]  above all, or one of the most significant factors is government programs are the solution for every
[02:21:49.240 --> 02:21:55.000]  problem. I don't believe any of those things. I do, as an old fashioned person, I still believe
[02:21:55.000 --> 02:21:59.400]  that it's important for working families to get a fair shake in the justice system and in the
[02:21:59.400 --> 02:22:05.480]  taxation system, in the courts, in the media. But I share your disappointment in what's going
[02:22:05.480 --> 02:22:10.520]  on at the national level in Washington. Sure. Well, I know how there are some districts and
[02:22:10.520 --> 02:22:13.880]  areas around the country where you've got some Democrats that are more conservative than most
[02:22:13.880 --> 02:22:17.240]  conservatives. You just never see them in the national spotlight because the media doesn't
[02:22:17.240 --> 02:22:20.200]  want people to know that. So it's good to know there are still a few of the Democrats out there
[02:22:20.200 --> 02:22:26.760]  now. And there's also some Republicans that act like the worst leftist. So people like John McCain.
[02:22:28.120 --> 02:22:31.080]  Let's get back into Robert Mueller because a lot of people want to jump off a cliff and they
[02:22:31.080 --> 02:22:34.440]  hear about Robert Mueller. They're sick of it. They know it's bull. That's not the story as you were
[02:22:34.440 --> 02:22:39.400]  saying. And you're detailing just in a few minutes we had all the proof of cover up. But for cover
[02:22:39.400 --> 02:22:45.400]  up, he's the guy that's brought in and your book just runs through it all. And then into all the
[02:22:45.400 --> 02:22:50.920]  laws they broke to illegally surveil Trump. And then they use the new Russia investigation as a
[02:22:50.920 --> 02:22:57.800]  cover for all the illegality there. And then the lack of prosecution of Mueller, of Hillary,
[02:22:57.800 --> 02:23:02.600]  just the brazenness where these people are supposedly more powerful than the president
[02:23:02.600 --> 02:23:07.560]  all because they've got so many dead bodies under their under their belt.
[02:23:08.520 --> 02:23:13.880]  Well, they need to be taken task. We've talked about Whitey Bulger Pan Am 103. We know that
[02:23:13.880 --> 02:23:20.120]  President Bush senior brought Mueller in to basically sweep criminal activity under the
[02:23:20.120 --> 02:23:26.040]  the rug under the carpet and make sure that the major players and VCCI got a slap on the wrist.
[02:23:28.280 --> 02:23:35.720]  And that question asked these questions about Robert Mueller's morality after an 11 he helps
[02:23:35.720 --> 02:23:40.600]  whisk the bin lottons and ranking Saudis who actually had some potential culpable knowledge
[02:23:40.600 --> 02:23:46.440]  about 9 11 with helps take them fly them out of America. Yet he he goes ahead and crowds hundreds
[02:23:46.440 --> 02:23:52.840]  of hapless immigrants in New York City who had nothing to do with 9 11 and basically helps supervise
[02:23:52.840 --> 02:23:58.200]  their use in New York City jails. So we question Robert Mueller's morality. We can we question his
[02:23:58.200 --> 02:24:06.360]  math. He makes a mounts a major prosecutorial attack on pal Paul Manafort for apparently a few
[02:24:06.360 --> 02:24:11.480]  million dollars of tax monies or monies that were spent. But yet when it's the BCCI folks
[02:24:13.160 --> 02:24:19.480]  committing fraud, money laundering, supporting drug operations to the tune of billions of dollars,
[02:24:19.480 --> 02:24:23.720]  where is his math? So he's going to fly off the handle over a few millions. But when the
[02:24:23.720 --> 02:24:28.920]  mistakes financially economically are thousands of times higher, he goes ahead and gets tired
[02:24:28.920 --> 02:24:34.920]  and is willing to take orders from the people that don't want the higher ups held to account.
[02:24:34.920 --> 02:24:40.360]  So he's we question his morality. We question his math. We question his memory and specifically
[02:24:40.360 --> 02:24:46.920]  and I a lot in my book. In fact, I acknowledge specifically the work of your outstanding colleague
[02:24:46.920 --> 02:24:52.600]  Jerome Corsi. He shows that not only did Robert Mueller, according to State Department Cables,
[02:24:52.600 --> 02:24:59.160]  hand deliver highly enriched uranium to a tarmac in Russia, according to your own Corsi.
[02:24:59.160 --> 02:25:07.400]  In addition to that, he basically took a dive and allowed the Clintons to accumulate and later
[02:25:07.400 --> 02:25:13.000]  transmit to the Russians 20 percent of America's uranium interest. So if we want to talk about
[02:25:13.000 --> 02:25:18.440]  real Russian collusion, not fake news Russian collusion, but real Mueller's right in the middle
[02:25:18.440 --> 02:25:22.360]  of it. And let's expand that that separately confirmed about the uranium, but he claims,
[02:25:22.360 --> 02:25:27.160]  well, Hillary ordered him, so it was okay. It's just crazy. You've got real tarmac meetings.
[02:25:27.160 --> 02:25:32.920]  Let's remember Corsi believes he will be indicted Friday by Mueller. So you write a book about
[02:25:32.920 --> 02:25:38.520]  Mueller and crushing with each state and you get indicted by him. I mean, how obvious is this?
[02:25:38.520 --> 02:25:43.320]  And then the Democrats talk about Trump's war on the press when Obama put hundreds of whistleblowers
[02:25:43.320 --> 02:25:49.080]  and journalists in prison for nothing. These people are sick. You're right. No, it is an outrage.
[02:25:49.080 --> 02:25:57.880]  And, you know, Mueller, he not only allowed stood by stood down stood down is a good term to allow
[02:25:57.880 --> 02:26:03.480]  the Clintons and the Russians to go ahead and make transactions on 20 percent of America's uranium
[02:26:04.200 --> 02:26:12.600]  interest. He also allowed the Clintons to receive probably, you know, a hundred million or several
[02:26:12.600 --> 02:26:18.120]  hundred million dollars from the Russian interest in connection with them selling out America's
[02:26:18.120 --> 02:26:23.960]  uranium interest. Ruby Ridge, we know that Randy, you know, the federal agents shot up Randy Weaver's
[02:26:23.960 --> 02:26:28.040]  family. They shot him in the back while he was unarmed and looking at the body of his
[02:26:29.320 --> 02:26:33.880]  teenage son who had been shot in the back and killed by a sub machine gun,
[02:26:33.880 --> 02:26:39.960]  wielded by a federal agent. We know that federal agents shot Randy Weaver's wife in the head as
[02:26:39.960 --> 02:26:43.960]  she was standing in the doorway of their Ruby Ridge cabin, holding her 10, I think 10 months
[02:26:43.960 --> 02:26:49.880]  year old, 10 month old daughter, excuse me. And what was Mueller's, and of course I want to make,
[02:26:49.880 --> 02:26:56.200]  be clear, Mueller was not in charge of that investigation or that assault. But according
[02:26:56.200 --> 02:27:02.840]  to the New York Times, Mueller's response afterwards was not why are federal agents shooting up a
[02:27:02.840 --> 02:27:09.960]  family in Ruby Ridge, Idaho's response is how dare anyone criticize federal agents for shooting an
[02:27:09.960 --> 02:27:14.200]  unarmed woman while she's holding a 10 month. Oh yeah. Now, Mueller thinks he's God and they
[02:27:14.200 --> 02:27:18.120]  worship him in DC, all the little sick of fans and cowards. Let's continue on.
[02:27:19.320 --> 02:27:27.560]  9-Eleven, he basically, he was brought in by President Bush Jr. one week before 9-Eleven.
[02:27:27.560 --> 02:27:31.080]  And if that's coincidental, I think the viewers have to decide for themselves.
[02:27:31.080 --> 02:27:39.480]  What we do know is that he came in and instead of investigating 9-Eleven, he covered up 9-Eleven.
[02:27:39.480 --> 02:27:46.520]  True investigative efforts to, for example, go out to San Diego and detail the fact that an FBI
[02:27:47.400 --> 02:27:54.280]  asset was providing a place to stay and money. And credit cards to the hijackers. The truth was
[02:27:54.280 --> 02:27:58.440]  the hijackers are being protected. Thank you. Mueller comes in, John O'Neill was exposing it,
[02:27:58.440 --> 02:28:03.640]  he dies on 9-Eleven, a good FBI agent, deputy head of counterterrorism, deputy director,
[02:28:03.640 --> 02:28:07.480]  head of counterterrorism. So we'll come back and talk about all that and then Mueller came in
[02:28:07.480 --> 02:28:12.760]  and covered up the good FBI agents saying we were ordered to stand down. We'll talk about it more
[02:28:13.320 --> 02:28:18.200]  when we come back because we haven't even gotten into the current stuff. The anthrax cover-up,
[02:28:19.080 --> 02:28:24.680]  all the patsies, the bizarre deaths there. It just goes on and on. Robert Mueller. Oh,
[02:28:24.680 --> 02:28:27.800]  where do people find Robert Mueller, Aaron Boyd for the New World War, John?
[02:28:28.520 --> 02:28:36.280]  Well, Alex, thank you. It's Robert Mueller, Aaron Boyd.com, Robert Mueller, Aaron Boyd.com,
[02:28:36.280 --> 02:28:40.920]  or of course, Amazon, either one. Absolutely. And get it, read it, and then give it to the local
[02:28:40.920 --> 02:28:46.040]  library so a bunch of the folks read it. This man is a monster, an un-American enemy of this country.
[02:28:46.040 --> 02:28:49.320]  And his little Aaron Boyd, Phil Mudd, says they're going to kill the president.
[02:28:50.040 --> 02:28:57.720]  Mueller is really a CIA assassin from Vietnam. Hi, I'm Dan Pilla. I started fighting the IRS

[02:32:54.680 --> 02:33:13.160]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:33:13.160 --> 02:33:30.360]  Resistance to Tyrants is obedience to God. It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:31.000 --> 02:33:39.000]  Boy, they got really mad right before my platforming when it come out in the news that
[02:33:39.000 --> 02:33:45.720]  Robert Mueller was using Jeffrey Epstein, the procure of young girls for sex,
[02:33:47.480 --> 02:33:52.680]  on these rape islands they have, and that Mueller was using him as an informant to set people up.
[02:33:53.320 --> 02:33:59.720]  So I said, by extension, if you know something's going on, you let it happen that he is aiding
[02:33:59.720 --> 02:34:03.880]  and abetting the rape of children, which we know they use these sex crimes to control people.
[02:34:03.880 --> 02:34:09.320]  On boy, the media said, Jones says, Mueller is raping children.
[02:34:11.000 --> 02:34:15.320]  Now, I said, no, he didn't do that. He just knows what's going on, which is the same thing.
[02:34:15.960 --> 02:34:19.960]  So you can add that to the repertoire of everything he's involved in.
[02:34:21.000 --> 02:34:26.120]  And just everybody's so scared of this dirty, ugly, stupid killer, and his family involved,
[02:34:26.120 --> 02:34:32.520]  the Kennedy assassination, all the rest of it. This guy is a, you know, big establishment,
[02:34:32.520 --> 02:34:39.480]  super rich fat cat. And you know what? He'll face God. He'll face God. There is a heaven,
[02:34:39.480 --> 02:34:44.440]  there is a hell. He will face God. God will bring judgment on Robert Mueller. And again,
[02:34:45.560 --> 02:34:50.680]  I don't have fun poking criminals like this, but everybody else needs to learn not to be cowards
[02:34:50.680 --> 02:34:56.360]  because they get off on this and how, oh, you can't talk about about his majesty. You can't talk about
[02:34:56.360 --> 02:35:03.080]  about him. There is an epic disconnect between the Robert Mueller described by the mass media and
[02:35:03.080 --> 02:35:09.800]  officialdom as a model of public propriety and the Robert Mueller documented by independent
[02:35:09.800 --> 02:35:15.080]  researchers, a chronic collaborator with career characterized by coverups, corruption,
[02:35:15.080 --> 02:35:20.520]  and unconceivable conduct, an ever willing instrument of the deep state.
[02:35:20.520 --> 02:35:28.040]  You need to read the book, folks, because we're here understanding who these monsters are and
[02:35:28.040 --> 02:35:35.640]  the arrogance of Mueller believing that he could go and take on Trump and the populist movement
[02:35:35.640 --> 02:35:40.360]  and all this. Well, guess what they are? They're stealing elections everywhere. They're calling
[02:35:40.360 --> 02:35:47.560]  for war. They're out of control. They're crazy people. And continuing through his history,
[02:35:47.560 --> 02:35:53.000]  we've got State Senator John Milkovich, John Milkovich for senate.com's website.
[02:35:53.960 --> 02:35:59.320]  He's written Robert Mueller, Aaron Borf, the new owner. It's important to drill in and to see
[02:36:01.480 --> 02:36:06.200]  who runs these ridiculous witch hunts. And again, to have his main prosecutor in the
[02:36:06.200 --> 02:36:10.360]  witch hunt be Hillary Clinton's former personal attack dog. Why not just have Hillary do it?
[02:36:10.360 --> 02:36:16.440]  I mean, these people are so arrogant, John. Well, they've gotten away with a lot. And I
[02:36:16.440 --> 02:36:22.920]  appreciate you touching on Mueller's culpability and the cover up of the events of 9 11. We know
[02:36:22.920 --> 02:36:29.720]  that not only did he post 9 11 try to stop. In fact, a former state senator, Senator Graham from
[02:36:29.720 --> 02:36:35.800]  Florida basically said that look, we want to go to San Diego and find out what an FBI informant is
[02:36:35.800 --> 02:36:45.080]  doing, providing cover and shelter for a Saudi terrorist and Mueller try to stop them. We know
[02:36:45.080 --> 02:36:52.040]  also that when the 9 11 commission was hearing witnesses testimony that Mueller was sending
[02:36:52.040 --> 02:36:58.440]  minders to that testimony to try to intimidate federal agents and witnesses and new things from
[02:36:58.440 --> 02:37:05.480]  telling what they knew. He and we know that Mueller that the FBI agents that were blowing the whistle
[02:37:05.480 --> 02:37:13.080]  on a that were trying to stop a oncoming terrorist attack that they were punished, lost their
[02:37:13.080 --> 02:37:18.200]  security clearance. Essentially, some of them drummed out of the FBI. However, the agents that
[02:37:18.200 --> 02:37:21.800]  are willing to lie, take orders, do the wrong thing, they get promoted, they get raises,
[02:37:21.800 --> 02:37:26.920]  they get money. Let's talk about anthrax. Anthrax, of course, five people died. A horrible thing.
[02:37:26.920 --> 02:37:32.680]  It coincidentally or not to the anthrax samples were directed to senators that were opposing
[02:37:33.320 --> 02:37:38.920]  mass surveillance on the law abiding American citizens. We know that initially the government,
[02:37:38.920 --> 02:37:45.240]  the federal government tried to say, well, this is the the bin Laden click and the scientific
[02:37:45.240 --> 02:37:53.400]  community quickly came to the fore and said, look, you know, that mid easterners and caves do not have
[02:37:53.400 --> 02:37:58.760]  the technology and the science and the capability to produce anthrax. They don't have the giant
[02:37:58.760 --> 02:38:06.040]  centrifuges. They don't they don't have to produce it to microscopic levels and then make it be
[02:38:06.040 --> 02:38:13.640]  aerosolized. There you go. That's exactly right. And in addition, Alex, after the scientists blew
[02:38:13.640 --> 02:38:18.760]  that first theory out of the water, then Mueller, people are saying that this has to be an American
[02:38:18.760 --> 02:38:25.480]  lab that's doing work with American intelligence, American military. Well, that looks bad if we
[02:38:25.480 --> 02:38:30.760]  have an American lab that's doing black ops killing people with anthrax. So Mueller said, well,
[02:38:30.760 --> 02:38:35.400]  we can't have that. That's going to look too bad if we get the proof that an American lab that's
[02:38:35.400 --> 02:38:40.520]  doing intelligence work is actually killing people. And by the way, anthrax, some people think it was
[02:38:40.520 --> 02:38:47.000]  part of the agenda behind this. And in so far as it could have been a black ops was to encourage the
[02:38:48.120 --> 02:38:52.920]  passage of less legislation would take away American liberties, the Patriot Act and associated.
[02:38:52.920 --> 02:38:58.760]  So anyway, what happens that they try the caveman theory that doesn't work. The the arrow starts
[02:38:58.760 --> 02:39:03.240]  pointing toward American labs. That's getting very politically incorrect. So what do they do? They
[02:39:03.240 --> 02:39:09.960]  pick on a scapegoat Bruce Ivins. And what is the scientific evidence show? The best top biochemists
[02:39:09.960 --> 02:39:15.320]  in the world that work with these types of spores say there's no way one man could have done it.
[02:39:15.320 --> 02:39:21.560]  Richard Spurzel, one of the top spore biochemical experts who works with the with the United
[02:39:21.560 --> 02:39:28.360]  Nations said, look, it would take me a year over a year with my own lab, all the resources of my
[02:39:28.360 --> 02:39:34.840]  own team to try to come up with this highly weaponized areas, ariosolized anthrax. And now we
[02:39:34.840 --> 02:39:40.440]  know where it came from Fort Detrick, Maryland at the big supply base. Right. They put they pointed
[02:39:40.440 --> 02:39:44.200]  they pointed at Ivins. He didn't have the team. He didn't have the know how he didn't have the
[02:39:44.200 --> 02:39:51.080]  technology scientific analysis of his anthrax sample show that they were clearly scientifically
[02:39:51.080 --> 02:39:55.480]  chemically distinct from the anthrax that was used. And the guy has no motive. Why did they
[02:39:55.480 --> 02:40:00.520]  pick on him? This is a theory that I mentioned in the book. He he did have some emotional problems
[02:40:00.520 --> 02:40:06.680]  from a difficult childhood. He had a therapist that was an ex drug addict or present drug addict
[02:40:06.680 --> 02:40:11.960]  to the FBI leaned on and she was willing to sell out her own patient. So all of a sudden they can
[02:40:11.960 --> 02:40:18.680]  discredit him, basically impugn him, scandalize him, slander him before the case ever gets to court.
[02:40:19.240 --> 02:40:23.560]  The bottom line is Bruce Ivins ends up dead before the case ever goes to court,
[02:40:23.560 --> 02:40:28.840]  which that's very fortuitous because Mueller's investigation and prosecution and his evidence
[02:40:28.840 --> 02:40:37.480]  was falling apart. By the way, the FBI agent, the lab, this investigation sued the FBI because he
[02:40:37.480 --> 02:40:42.840]  said the investigation was not, it wasn't a cover up and that they covered up evidence that showed
[02:40:42.840 --> 02:40:53.400]  that I've done it. So but anyway, I'll repeat that because your official stories he committed suicide.
[02:40:54.120 --> 02:41:04.440]  Okay. Okay. Well, the former FBI agent, Alex, that was leading the anthrax
[02:41:04.440 --> 02:41:10.120]  investigation at least normally, he actually sued the FBI for trying to shut down a real
[02:41:10.120 --> 02:41:17.080]  investigation. He said that the FBI under Mueller's leadership sabotage the anthrax investigation.
[02:41:17.080 --> 02:41:24.520]  He filed the whistleblower suit. And of course, Bruce Ivins conveniently died right when Mueller's
[02:41:25.160 --> 02:41:28.680]  anthrax investigation was about ready to be subject to public scrutiny.
[02:41:28.680 --> 02:41:33.960]  Yeah, they crammed a bunch of Tylenol down his throat. Now, a bunch of other people died too.
[02:41:34.680 --> 02:41:38.760]  And we'll never even have time in the time we have left to get into the modern stuff he's done.
[02:41:38.760 --> 02:41:46.120]  The point is, he is the most corrupt FBI director probably ever and that's saying a lot.
[02:41:47.240 --> 02:41:52.760]  And he is a globalist. So which one about Jagger Hoover, he was not out to get rid of the country.
[02:41:53.320 --> 02:41:59.320]  And Mueller just is a monster. And I mean, is that what spurred you because you kind of described
[02:41:59.320 --> 02:42:05.240]  that on the inside of the book that studying how bad this guy is, then watching the media,
[02:42:05.240 --> 02:42:09.880]  you would think that, you know, he's second only to Jesus Christ. But in reality, he is a horrible
[02:42:09.880 --> 02:42:18.440]  thug. He is. And of course, we haven't even gotten to Alex, the fact that he repeated the lie to
[02:42:18.440 --> 02:42:26.680]  the United States Congress to help get us in war. The weapons of mass destruction story put on fake
[02:42:26.680 --> 02:42:33.240]  news. This is a super bad dude. He's always brought forward to really betray people and to launch
[02:42:33.240 --> 02:42:38.680]  wars that killed a lot of innocent people. And again, that was go, oh, Jones, you say you care
[02:42:38.680 --> 02:42:41.560]  about our military, but you're saying these wars were wrong. Yeah, our military didn't like them
[02:42:41.560 --> 02:42:45.880]  either. I'm not I'm for the military. I'm not for people lying to bring them to war. And then to
[02:42:45.880 --> 02:42:49.480]  take out regimes and put stuff even worse in, which is part of the plan to collapse the Middle
[02:42:49.480 --> 02:42:53.400]  East into Europe. We'll be back with some of the current stuff old Mueller's up to.
[02:42:55.160 --> 02:43:00.280]  It's really hard to have the energy at the end of the day to still get to the gym or to go for a
[02:43:00.280 --> 02:43:05.960]  run or go to the park or heck even take your dog for a walk. Believe me, I know I spend hours in
[02:43:05.960 --> 02:43:10.600]  front of a screen and then hours in front of bright lights every day. But thanks to super

[02:43:21.880 --> 02:43:26.600]  against the modern day lifestyle with the screen time and the extended hours to still have the
[02:43:26.600 --> 02:43:32.920]  stamina and endurance, energy and drive to get to the gym, get to the park and get exercise that

[02:43:52.360 --> 02:43:58.680]  The globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the
[02:43:58.680 --> 02:44:02.200]  environment full of the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromine, you name it,
[02:44:02.760 --> 02:44:08.600]  that it lowers IQ, it literally dumps the population down. And on our quest to bring
[02:44:08.600 --> 02:44:13.320]  our listeners and viewers the best iodine in the world, we've gone through two permutations.
[02:44:13.880 --> 02:44:18.280]  First seaweed based iodine that was pretty good but hard to source and the globalists
[02:44:18.280 --> 02:44:22.920]  tried to block us getting a supply of it. So we discovered deep earth crystals of pure
[02:44:22.920 --> 02:44:27.880]  nascent iodine and brought you X2 that's been incredible. Now due to the establishment trying
[02:44:27.880 --> 02:44:33.480]  to block that, we did more research and secured more of the deep earth crystals of nascent iodine.
[02:44:33.480 --> 02:44:38.680]  But chemists, scientists and others showed us the research that by combining it with three other
[02:44:38.680 --> 02:44:47.480]  compounds, two forms of iodine and vitamin C, it supercharges it and makes it even more bio available.
[02:44:47.480 --> 02:44:50.120]  Ladies and gentlemen, you want to research it, you want to see it,
[02:44:50.120 --> 02:44:54.600]  it's an incredible discovery. X3, now available at m4slife.com.

[02:47:16.600 --> 02:47:22.360]  All right, I'm going to end up hosting the fourth hour of Roger Stone coming up, because there's
[02:47:22.360 --> 02:47:28.120]  a bunch of stuff I was going to play that gives it so incredibly important. And all of it ties in.
[02:47:28.120 --> 02:47:33.800]  We've got Obama-appointed judge who's signaled she's going to overturn the Georgia election,
[02:47:34.440 --> 02:47:40.920]  even though the Republicans won by 58,000 votes. And the Democrats have found all these trucks
[02:47:40.920 --> 02:47:45.800]  full of ballots. Of course, it'll be just like Florida, just like Arizona, just like California.
[02:47:45.800 --> 02:47:51.160]  She'll be given the win. And then I've got another article here. It's on infowars.com.
[02:47:53.320 --> 02:48:00.840]  Hillary's Hinch Woman heads Mueller's probe of stone. And then this wasn't even in the news.
[02:48:00.840 --> 02:48:08.200]  I don't even say this. But Tyler Nixon, Roger's lawyer, gets called in. And he's there.
[02:48:08.200 --> 02:48:18.680]  And sure enough, here she comes in running it, Jeannie Ray. Now, the Democrats, again,
[02:48:19.880 --> 02:48:22.600]  are engaged in that type of behavior. But then coming up with Roger Stone,
[02:48:23.560 --> 02:48:25.560]  then we're going to go to our guest to finish up.
[02:48:29.400 --> 02:48:34.280]  Now you've got the Maryland Attorney General, the California Attorney General,
[02:48:34.280 --> 02:48:39.480]  the Chief Counsel of San Francisco with all its filthy tentacles, always reaching out,
[02:48:39.480 --> 02:48:43.880]  trying to shut us down. And that's really like the capital of the Satan's empire.
[02:48:46.680 --> 02:48:53.160]  To remove the new acting AG saying Trump has no authority when a two-year-old,
[02:48:54.520 --> 02:48:59.320]  okay, maybe a four-year-old, could read article two, section two,
[02:48:59.320 --> 02:49:05.400]  grants the president the power to appoint ambassadors. And he's got, you know, his cabinet,
[02:49:05.400 --> 02:49:14.840]  all of it. And he's got 210 days until even that has to start the process. If Democrats block it,
[02:49:14.840 --> 02:49:20.520]  he can stay there for years. Domestic affairs, and that's the appointments clause. This is just
[02:49:20.520 --> 02:49:27.160]  like when they followed all these suits saying the president under the Constitution couldn't
[02:49:27.160 --> 02:49:31.000]  control the borders. That's an express thing with the president. He can ban people from whole
[02:49:31.000 --> 02:49:35.640]  countries he wants, whatever. That's the power of the presidency in the Constitution. But notice
[02:49:35.640 --> 02:49:38.280]  all the courts rolled against him until he got to the Supreme Court, and they said, yeah,
[02:49:38.920 --> 02:49:44.680]  two plus two equals four, but barely. And so that's why this country is so close to the edge,
[02:49:44.680 --> 02:49:48.360]  why they want to remove Trump. They're even talking about saying Kavanaugh isn't legitimate,
[02:49:49.240 --> 02:49:53.720]  just like they're saying Whitaker isn't legitimate. And they're pulling that out of
[02:49:53.720 --> 02:49:59.080]  their rear end, ladies and gentlemen. I mean, this is, everything they're doing is breaking the
[02:49:59.080 --> 02:50:06.200]  social contract and is lawless. But when a bunch of lawlessness is being carried out,
[02:50:06.200 --> 02:50:12.040]  it is basically a form of martial law by this mafia. And so they keep saying they're worried
[02:50:12.040 --> 02:50:17.720]  Trump will declare martial law. Well, they've already basically done it. And so we are rapidly
[02:50:17.720 --> 02:50:25.480]  approaching that point of the white flag and leave the country. Do you just hope some indictments
[02:50:25.480 --> 02:50:30.040]  happen or you punish these arrogant sycophants like Hillary? I mean, these out of control people?
[02:50:30.040 --> 02:50:35.240]  Or I mean, what does the president do when you're faced with this? Government stay behind
[02:50:35.240 --> 02:50:38.520]  networks from the Democrats. And I want to say Democrats, I mean, deep state, they've got them
[02:50:38.520 --> 02:50:43.400]  in both parties, but making their moves, sabotaging the president, trying to drive down the economy.
[02:50:43.400 --> 02:50:48.280]  Maxine Waters says when she gets control of the committee that deals with finance and jobs,
[02:50:48.280 --> 02:50:52.680]  she's going to derail everything. And you see the stock market start going down.
[02:50:52.680 --> 02:50:58.840]  This is really a criminal takeover. And if you're a Democrat or Republican, if you're a Christian,
[02:50:58.840 --> 02:51:03.400]  you have discernment. You know, our guest is a Democrat from Louisiana, but he's a pro-second
[02:51:03.400 --> 02:51:08.920]  amendment guy on a Patriot. I was often with his work, the book Robert Mueller, John Milkovich,
[02:51:08.920 --> 02:51:13.880]  he's written Robert Mueller, Aaron Borger, New World Order. People can find that on his website.
[02:51:13.880 --> 02:51:17.640]  Let it come back or go on one of our other shows and do a whole hour just on part two,
[02:51:17.640 --> 02:51:21.880]  the modern stuff, which a lot of us know about, but just in a minute or two or three minutes or
[02:51:21.880 --> 02:51:25.720]  so, we have time left. Other points you want to say about Mueller, because I'm not going to say,
[02:51:25.720 --> 02:51:32.120]  oh, we're tough guys. We're macho guys. We're going to get smaller. I was told, I mean, I've
[02:51:32.120 --> 02:51:37.000]  basically been in DC at some of the biggest law firms and groups, and they literally say, man,
[02:51:37.000 --> 02:51:43.240]  you're crazy. Robert Mueller is a killer. He's vengeful, all these people. No, I know Hillary's
[02:51:43.240 --> 02:51:49.800]  evil. I know Mueller's evil. It's all these men that just think it's tough to act tough,
[02:51:49.800 --> 02:51:53.640]  but when it comes time to have moral courage, they have done it, and I can't help it. In fact,
[02:51:53.640 --> 02:51:59.720]  my guts, you know, at a certain level, don't like going up against Hillary and flying airplanes
[02:51:59.720 --> 02:52:04.600]  everywhere, saying Hillary for president and lock her up. We launched all that. At a gut level,
[02:52:04.600 --> 02:52:09.800]  I know it's dangerous, but at another gut level, we're going to lose our entire culture in our
[02:52:09.800 --> 02:52:14.680]  society if we don't start standing up. I mean, there's no end to these crazy people. My line in
[02:52:14.680 --> 02:52:19.080]  the sand is they want to teach five-year-olds that they're not a boy or girl. My line in the sand is
[02:52:19.080 --> 02:52:22.920]  they want to, you know, say my kids belong to the state. My bottom line is they want to say
[02:52:22.920 --> 02:52:27.480]  churches can't preach the gospel. I mean, my God, these people are crazy. I mean, doesn't
[02:52:27.480 --> 02:52:32.840]  Robert Mueller, all these crooks, no, they just can't keep trying to enslave us forever. So bottom
[02:52:32.840 --> 02:52:36.840]  line, I'm going to get a few other points for you. What was your line in the sand? Because I know
[02:52:36.840 --> 02:52:41.720]  you do a lot of stuff that's quite controversial to the establishment. I just, I just think that as
[02:52:41.720 --> 02:52:48.840]  we look, I came across multiple articles and documentaries by different journalists talking
[02:52:48.840 --> 02:52:54.440]  about specific episodes of corruption by Robert Mueller, but I kept coming after episode after
[02:52:54.440 --> 02:52:59.320]  episode after episode. At one point, I thought, you know, someone needs to try to bring the
[02:52:59.320 --> 02:53:05.080]  corruption together. We have not exhausted it. We haven't even talked today about the fact that
[02:53:05.080 --> 02:53:09.480]  Mueller went to the United States Congress and the American people and lied and said,
[02:53:09.480 --> 02:53:17.160]  we need wall-to-wall 24-7 total surveillance of all Americans. We need your phone conversations,
[02:53:17.160 --> 02:53:23.160]  your emails, your faxes, your, your texts in order to stop 9-11, which was another lie.
[02:53:23.160 --> 02:53:29.320]  And now they've used that to politically persecute patriots and outsiders. Really, independence
[02:53:29.320 --> 02:53:33.800]  is what Trump is trying to fix the country. Really, I mean, Trump, for my research, is really
[02:53:33.800 --> 02:53:38.040]  getting up their bat. He believes that he just turns the economy back on and acts like a decent
[02:53:38.040 --> 02:53:43.880]  president that America would unify. But sadly, I'm not sure America may be so diseased by the
[02:53:43.880 --> 02:53:47.640]  mainstream media that I'm not sure we're not too far gone at some point. It's very sad.
[02:53:47.640 --> 02:53:54.920]  Well, and I do think that what's happening, and this, there is the epic, what we call an
[02:53:54.920 --> 02:53:59.960]  epic disconnect between the, the Robert Mueller that's presented in the mass mainstream media
[02:53:59.960 --> 02:54:07.160]  and his biography. His biography is, is corruption, callousness and, and carelessness with the truth.
[02:54:07.160 --> 02:54:13.480]  So when you look at that dichotomy, so that's number one, that the, the absolute discrepancy
[02:54:13.480 --> 02:54:20.440]  or chasm between the, the presentation and the reality. And the, the secondly, the fact that
[02:54:20.440 --> 02:54:28.840]  where do we find that he has the moral or moral credibility or integrity or character to conduct
[02:54:28.840 --> 02:54:34.280]  an investigation of this constitutional and historical magnitude. He does not. It's hard to
[02:54:34.280 --> 02:54:42.760]  conceive of anyone in America that would be less ethically qualified to conduct this
[02:54:42.760 --> 02:54:47.560]  investigation into President Trump. And, and I'll reiterate, and I think you, this is a theme of
[02:54:47.560 --> 02:54:56.040]  your, your media presentation, Alex, I applaud you for it. Donald Trump is an outsider. The
[02:54:56.040 --> 02:55:02.040]  globalists don't like him because he's standing up for an independent, sovereign and free America.
[02:55:02.040 --> 02:55:08.760]  Mueller is no patriot. He's an anti-patriot. He's trampling the constitution in investigation
[02:55:08.760 --> 02:55:12.440]  after investigation after investigation. The truth is collateral damage.
[02:55:18.040 --> 02:55:25.400]  It's like a football game that never ends, but I care a thousand times more. And we just see
[02:55:25.400 --> 02:55:28.600]  Trump trying to bring the country back, trying to bring people together and then everything
[02:55:28.600 --> 02:55:32.840]  that the mainstream media says about him is really what they're doing and just the increasing
[02:55:32.840 --> 02:55:38.920]  the lies and increasing the hate. It just surprises me that they've found enough people to be
[02:55:38.920 --> 02:55:46.840]  obstructionist and to lie like this. It just really scares me about how truly immoral the
[02:55:46.840 --> 02:55:53.160]  media class is. You know, Alex, this is my perception and, and I may be wrong. You may
[02:55:53.160 --> 02:56:00.920]  disagree with me, but there is a generational chasm in perceptions about President Trump.
[02:56:00.920 --> 02:56:07.400]  Our generation, and I hate to say publicly how old I am, but let me say, I'm, I'm certainly
[02:56:07.400 --> 02:56:15.080]  north of 40 is seeing this president and this presidency much different than people that are
[02:56:15.080 --> 02:56:20.040]  in their teens, 20s and 30s. And of course, I think it's the educational system in America
[02:56:20.040 --> 02:56:24.040]  that's been given to Common Core and the socialists have taken over and the agendas and, and my goodness,
[02:56:24.040 --> 02:56:28.280]  we have to be in the class because after all the corruption, the whole corrupt system is coming
[02:56:28.280 --> 02:56:34.680]  after him. And it's so obvious he's a lion's run about hyenas and then, and then people are just
[02:56:34.680 --> 02:56:38.440]  some of them are rejecting it, even though it's, it's obviously good for them.
[02:56:39.960 --> 02:56:45.720]  I just think in our age group, there is a strong critical mass of people that understand
[02:56:45.720 --> 02:56:50.360]  that this president for all of his mistakes and errors and the only perfect man that we know of
[02:56:50.360 --> 02:56:56.920]  was nailed to a tree. We know that. But I really get the fact that he loves America. And I think
[02:56:56.920 --> 02:57:02.680]  we need to pray for the president to connect with ethnic minorities to a greater degree than ever
[02:57:02.680 --> 02:57:08.040]  before. And I think he's doing that. We need to pray for him to connect more and more strongly with
[02:57:09.800 --> 02:57:13.880]  not only with ethnic minorities, but Democrats, independents. And we, and I was thinking about
[02:57:13.880 --> 02:57:21.800]  this the other day. It's even ironic that he gets criticized for hating the Muslims. It's not
[02:57:21.800 --> 02:57:26.920]  actually even true. What he has done is he's number one. He said, I don't want jihadists in America.
[02:57:26.920 --> 02:57:33.480]  That's not anti Muslim. That's anti jihadists. In number two, he says that if the Muslim jihadists
[02:57:33.480 --> 02:57:37.480]  are torturing and murdering people in the Middle East, we're going to take them on right where
[02:57:37.480 --> 02:57:43.880]  they are and wipe them off the face of the map. This president among in this, hold on, hold on,
[02:57:43.880 --> 02:57:48.360]  do five more minutes. We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with
[02:57:48.360 --> 02:57:53.640]  our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us
[02:57:53.640 --> 02:57:58.280]  through mother nature to detoxify the body. That's why I'm introducing Z shield, toxic
[02:57:58.280 --> 02:58:04.360]  metal and chemical defense support. It's made in the USA. It's filled with known compounds from
[02:58:04.360 --> 02:58:08.920]  nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the infomer.
[02:58:08.920 --> 02:58:14.680]  It is a classical 360 when this is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year.
[02:58:14.680 --> 02:58:19.720]  And now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as
[02:58:19.720 --> 02:58:23.560]  you can possibly get. You owe it to yourself. You owe it to your family and you owe it to
[02:58:23.560 --> 02:58:28.680]  the future of this country in the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as
[02:58:28.680 --> 02:58:34.760]  focused as you can be because we need you the remnant of America to reignite those brush fires
[02:58:34.760 --> 02:58:38.760]  the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be. Thanks to your support and your
[02:58:38.760 --> 02:58:43.160]  prayers together, we're changing the world. Now it's time to change our bodies with Z Shield

[02:59:45.160 --> 03:00:11.960]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[03:00:11.960 --> 03:00:16.440]  On final segment with John Milkovich and then I've got Roger Stone. When I say big news,
[03:00:16.440 --> 03:00:20.680]  we're going to cover the waterfront because as long as I need to get to and some breaking news,
[03:00:20.680 --> 03:00:25.480]  I haven't. But I got to say, I don't want to say it's depressing to be reminded of all the crimes
[03:00:25.480 --> 03:00:32.600]  Robert Mueller's, obviously Mueller Mueller's committed. It's just the fact that why would we
[03:00:32.600 --> 03:00:37.560]  have such horrible people in there and put up and then Trump comes in and I know what Trump's up to.
[03:00:37.560 --> 03:00:42.600]  I know that it tells no lobbyist, no corruption, no crap. I mean, Trump is just straight shooter.
[03:00:42.600 --> 03:00:48.440]  Now he's hard as nails on the level, but he just can't see this hate of America and flushing it
[03:00:48.440 --> 03:00:53.480]  down the toilet. And I can tell you, he's been a Christian, but his faith has gotten much stronger
[03:00:53.480 --> 03:00:59.720]  and he's been changed by all this. And you know, his wife obviously is a driving force in that.
[03:00:59.720 --> 03:01:04.440]  They always act like she's isn't supportive. It's the opposite. Okay. He wasn't going to run,
[03:01:04.440 --> 03:01:09.720]  except Melania said, you got to do it. Okay. And I'm going to leave it at that. And Trump did get
[03:01:09.720 --> 03:01:13.880]  recruited by patriots who knew what was going on five years ago. They said, you got to do it.
[03:01:14.440 --> 03:01:19.000]  They were looking at taking Obama out. And then they made the decision to try to relaunch the
[03:01:19.000 --> 03:01:22.760]  Republic and turn the economy on and all this stuff. And it's just, it's going to be a mess.
[03:01:22.760 --> 03:01:27.080]  I'm telling you, civil war folks, we don't fix this peacefully. And that's why I'm willing to
[03:01:27.080 --> 03:01:32.600]  stick it out there because the future is so horrible. I mean, we're talking nuclear war and
[03:01:32.600 --> 03:01:38.120]  stuff. Hillary was going to start wars. We've got three minutes left. You were getting into lift
[03:01:38.120 --> 03:01:43.240]  during the break praying for the president where all this is going. Gut level state senator,
[03:01:43.240 --> 03:01:48.280]  author of Robert Mueller, Aaron Boyd for the New World Order, John Milkovich closing comments.
[03:01:48.920 --> 03:01:55.000]  Well, you know, Alex, I want to thank you so much for your very courageous contributions to the
[03:01:55.000 --> 03:02:00.360]  public debate and bring into the fore the fact that we are, that there is corruption in this
[03:02:00.360 --> 03:02:05.880]  country and that some of the people that are represented as I say in the book that Robert
[03:02:05.880 --> 03:02:11.560]  Mueller is depicted as an on time press white shirt, a Eagle Scout, Dudley do right, just the
[03:02:11.560 --> 03:02:16.680]  opposite is true. And thanks, thank goodness for you and others like you that have the courage.
[03:02:16.680 --> 03:02:23.320]  We're able to go ahead and really expose the fact that he's a schemer. He's an operator and he has
[03:02:23.320 --> 03:02:29.000]  been for at least 30 years. And I want to close with this, if I may, you know, this book could
[03:02:29.000 --> 03:02:34.280]  be depressing because we see this man has this amazing power, so powerful and yet so very corrupt,
[03:02:34.280 --> 03:02:39.400]  it's very threatening to the republic. But the, but the really encouraging thing about this
[03:02:39.400 --> 03:02:44.040]  is the fact that so many writers and investigators, and by the way, we quote your
[03:02:44.840 --> 03:02:50.520]  investigative team and federal agents and soldiers and veterans and the victims of the families of
[03:02:50.520 --> 03:02:55.480]  the victims of 9 11 have come forward and brought this information. I think this is a great book,
[03:02:55.480 --> 03:03:01.160]  not because I was involved, but because of all the people that sacrificed much and risked everything
[03:03:01.160 --> 03:03:06.760]  to bring these facts to the fore. And that's what we try to do is compile the very courageous
[03:03:06.760 --> 03:03:12.280]  findings and investigative results of other folks. And we're going to continue to pray for you,
[03:03:12.280 --> 03:03:18.840]  Alex, we're going to continue to pray for our president for Roger. I've never met him. I'm
[03:03:18.840 --> 03:03:24.680]  referring to him by his first name. I've never met him, but I've and Dr. Corsi, you know, it's
[03:03:24.680 --> 03:03:30.920]  very important that y'all have had the backbone to bring these issues to the fore. Well, thank you.
[03:03:30.920 --> 03:03:34.440]  And when I say depressing, it feels good to know you're there in the books there and people are
[03:03:34.440 --> 03:03:41.400]  standing up. It's just it's it's beyond depressing. It's like it's an object. It's a creature in our
[03:03:41.400 --> 03:03:48.360]  way that threatening our whole existence that is an abomination. And then they add the sickening
[03:03:48.360 --> 03:03:54.760]  gravy or the icing of the worship of him. And I see grown men scared of him. And the fact that he's
[03:03:54.760 --> 03:03:59.640]  tried to set me up about liberty to get into it, all of it and the the the the obsess over me. And
[03:03:59.640 --> 03:04:05.720]  I know I'm totally innocent and that he's delivering uranium on tarmacs. It's to the Russians to the
[03:04:05.720 --> 03:04:13.080]  Russians to the Russians to the Russians. Is that Russian collusion taking highly enriched uranium?
[03:04:13.080 --> 03:04:17.160]  Don't hold your breath waiting for the mainstream media to report that. But I just want to see
[03:04:17.160 --> 03:04:23.000]  I want to see him indicted. And you know, if if I have to put myself in danger to make sure that
[03:04:23.000 --> 03:04:27.960]  he gets brought to justice, so be it. But I'll tell these guys something. You know, they really
[03:04:27.960 --> 03:04:33.000]  have been breaking the rules of chivalry. And I really am concerned for everybody if this goes
[03:04:33.000 --> 03:04:36.920]  much further. Because I can tell you, there are a lot of people that aren't going to put up with
[03:04:36.920 --> 03:04:41.160]  this stuff anymore. And it's just that simple. Thank you so much, Senator, for coming on to
[03:04:41.160 --> 03:04:46.120]  look forward to speaking to you again. God bless. Thank you, Alex. Thank you very much. We'll be back
[03:04:46.120 --> 03:04:50.920]  with Roger Stone, ladies and gentlemen. We are living in epic times. That word gets overused,
[03:04:50.920 --> 03:04:58.120]  but this is an epic time. Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[03:04:58.120 --> 03:05:03.640]  The real drama can be found here in Lelani estates. But a lot of us on the big island rely on rain
[03:05:03.640 --> 03:05:10.040]  water. And we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain. Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal
[03:05:10.040 --> 03:05:15.880]  particles. And acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels. To find out,
[03:05:15.880 --> 03:05:22.440]  we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH. What we learned was that
[03:05:22.440 --> 03:05:27.640]  there was, in fact, unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rain water. Next,
[03:05:27.640 --> 03:05:33.080]  we tested the water from our Alexa pure gravity filter. And not only were the heavy metal levels
[03:05:33.080 --> 03:05:39.640]  within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels. As it turns out,
[03:05:39.640 --> 03:05:45.320]  the filter on the Alexa pure raises the pH of the water. So what we've learned is that volcanic
[03:05:45.320 --> 03:05:50.600]  ash and acid rain can contaminate a rain water supply. But more importantly,
[03:05:50.600 --> 03:05:58.840]  a good water filtration system will purify it. Well, I was thumbing from Montgomery. I had my
[03:05:58.840 --> 03:06:07.400]  guitar on my back. When a stranger stopped beside me in an antique Cadillac, he was dressed like
[03:06:07.400 --> 03:06:23.800]  1950. Waging war on corruption. It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the
[03:06:23.800 --> 03:06:37.320]  info war. Roger has a really
[03:06:37.320 --> 03:06:43.000]  good personal friend who's very, very close to the president joining us to give you really big
[03:06:43.000 --> 03:06:48.680]  intel. And so I was going to ride shotgun for the whole hour, but I have a lot of news you
[03:06:48.680 --> 03:06:52.680]  don't do with Roger, but I'm going to duck out here at this segment. There's several big guests
[03:06:52.680 --> 03:07:00.520]  coming on. People probably notice I'm a lot calmer today. It's because things are so bad.
[03:07:00.520 --> 03:07:09.320]  It just really makes me take a few steps back. And the fact that this isn't just cut and dry,
[03:07:09.320 --> 03:07:16.600]  that we back Trump and back the country and back success and back God. And just to realize that
[03:07:16.600 --> 03:07:23.240]  it's not just something that's part of the operating system of Democrats at the national
[03:07:23.240 --> 03:07:28.760]  level and the globalist, but it's who their people are. They have so converted the average
[03:07:28.760 --> 03:07:35.400]  Democrat and the average leftist really into an America hater that the Ninth Circuit ruled years
[03:07:35.400 --> 03:07:42.120]  ago that you can't wear American flags and schools in those districts on the West Coast.
[03:07:42.120 --> 03:07:48.360]  It's a symbol of hate that the president saying it's okay to have a nation and be proud of America.
[03:07:48.360 --> 03:07:54.760]  And they say that's white supremacy and to have McCron say the greatest form of patriotism
[03:07:54.760 --> 03:08:02.040]  is not having a nation. And then you're just absorbed into some big global government that's
[03:08:02.040 --> 03:08:06.520]  absolutely evil and pays no taxes, but you pay great taxes. I mean, it's just a joke.
[03:08:08.520 --> 03:08:13.240]  But they use the power of consensus with all the news channels and all the newspapers going, look,
[03:08:15.240 --> 03:08:20.520]  Jim Acosta didn't touch the White House intern. Alex Jones faked it. Imphal Wars faked it. Paul
[03:08:20.520 --> 03:08:25.800]  Watson faked it. And you're like, it's a real video. There it is. But it's gaslight. And it's a
[03:08:25.800 --> 03:08:35.000]  psychological tactic. And then I see this little Jim. You've now got Maryland, San Francisco,
[03:08:35.000 --> 03:08:40.920]  state of California, attorney generals, Whitaker's appointment as acting attorney general is unlawful.
[03:08:40.920 --> 03:08:49.000]  Maryland says the government, attorney general, then even mainstream news goes, well, this is a
[03:08:49.000 --> 03:08:56.120]  new legal theory. No one's ever said this. And then we have the US Constitution. That's totally clear.
[03:08:58.200 --> 03:09:01.960]  In article two, section one, the power of appointment. There it is right here.
[03:09:02.600 --> 03:09:11.320]  Article two, section two, grants clause, power of appointing. And it has to be approved by
[03:09:11.320 --> 03:09:17.960]  Congress, but he's got 210 days. Totally normal. But it's just like they said he can't ban people
[03:09:17.960 --> 03:09:24.360]  from six countries that don't issue passports. You know, Somalia doesn't have airports, folks,
[03:09:24.360 --> 03:09:30.200]  but E-moms will issue a passport and people show up to fly into the US out of Tunisia,
[03:09:31.480 --> 03:09:35.800]  who are known terrorists with a fake passport that's written on a piece of paper. His E-mom gave him.
[03:09:38.200 --> 03:09:41.160]  These are countries that sell women in sex markets.
[03:09:41.160 --> 03:09:50.200]  Think about that. And then all the Democrat courts said it's terrible. Yes,
[03:09:50.200 --> 03:09:52.920]  we're striking it down until you get the Supreme Court. They said, of course, you can do that.
[03:09:53.720 --> 03:10:02.280]  That's how crazy this is. Just like the Republicans got 58,000 more votes in Georgia
[03:10:02.280 --> 03:10:08.280]  over the Looney Democrat, and they've got a federal judge appointed by Obama who signaled
[03:10:08.280 --> 03:10:11.320]  she's going to overturn the election and have a runoff.
[03:10:15.720 --> 03:10:20.520]  So, Roger, you're going to take over here. You get some big guests, but tidbits, they've got until,
[03:10:20.520 --> 03:10:27.720]  what, Friday or tomorrow, Thursday with Florida, you're in Broward County. We've got Matt Gates
[03:10:27.720 --> 03:10:34.200]  saying that they're testing what you said last week, the steal of 2020 here. They're saying if
[03:10:34.200 --> 03:10:40.680]  Trump challenges any of this known fraud, he's a dictator. And once martial law, it's the Democrats
[03:10:40.680 --> 03:10:46.280]  that are already acting as a lawless group, seizing power in a criminal coup, basically,
[03:10:46.280 --> 03:10:50.680]  via the elections and everywhere else. And at a certain point, I've said this, the president
[03:10:50.680 --> 03:10:55.960]  has to have a nationwide address, bring all this out, say, we really want the election,
[03:10:55.960 --> 03:11:00.600]  show the evidence. They said that Hillary really won when she didn't with no evidence.
[03:11:00.600 --> 03:11:05.480]  So, I mean, I think it's coming down to, if the Democrats already put us into a civil emergency,
[03:11:06.040 --> 03:11:11.080]  the threat level, they're out of lawlessness. At a certain point, I don't think half measures
[03:11:11.080 --> 03:11:15.960]  with Whitaker are enough here. I mean, I think Trump must go on the thermonuclear,
[03:11:15.960 --> 03:11:20.280]  I don't mean literally, but he has to go nuclear option. The Democrats have said,
[03:11:20.280 --> 03:11:25.160]  we don't like America. America can't exist. America's bad. America was never great.
[03:11:25.160 --> 03:11:32.840]  They are now completely converted to working for foreign powers. And that's not an overstatement.
[03:11:32.840 --> 03:11:39.160]  Anything else is a lie. We are in total meltdown crisis. As I predicted, we got a beachhead with
[03:11:39.160 --> 03:11:49.800]  Trump. I said the counteroffensive is going to be absolutely incredible. And I'm not up here trying
[03:11:49.800 --> 03:11:55.320]  to punch the globalists in the nose every day just to act tough. I understand the clear and present
[03:11:55.320 --> 03:11:59.560]  danger to everything if we don't. And I'm sick of their bullying. I'm sick of their intimidation.
[03:11:59.560 --> 03:12:05.160]  I'm sick of their lies. And they are just escalating things into a very dangerous zone.
[03:12:05.800 --> 03:12:09.320]  I mean, I can't help it, man. The areas of my brain that are starting to turn on,
[03:12:09.320 --> 03:12:16.840]  it is not good, Roger. Well, I must say this, Alex, I'm becoming increasingly confident about
[03:12:16.840 --> 03:12:22.920]  Florida. The real dichotomy here is pretty clear. The Democrats are saying, count every vote.
[03:12:22.920 --> 03:12:29.640]  And the Republicans are saying, count every legal vote. As each day goes by, the shenanigans of
[03:12:29.640 --> 03:12:36.120]  Brenda Snipes and the Broward County Board of Elections become more apparent to anybody who
[03:12:36.120 --> 03:12:41.320]  will look at it objectively. We're going to have a special report on the war room later today,
[03:12:41.320 --> 03:12:48.520]  regarding the latest evidence of fraud at the Broward County Board of Elections under Ms. Snipes.
[03:12:49.400 --> 03:12:55.480]  But the most significant development today, Alex, is that it turns out President Donald Trump
[03:12:55.480 --> 03:13:02.120]  consulted the Department of Justice prior to the appointment of acting Attorney General Matthew
[03:13:02.120 --> 03:13:07.320]  Whitaker. And the department told him the appointment was valid and perfectly legal.
[03:13:07.320 --> 03:13:15.160]  And they cited 160 other instances as precedent. So all of that hand-wringing,
[03:13:15.160 --> 03:13:21.560]  all of that jumping up and down and screaming by Chuck Schumer and Congressman Jerry Nadler and
[03:13:21.560 --> 03:13:27.160]  Adam Schiff and these other... I mean, if Trump takes a breath or if Trump trims his fingernails,
[03:13:27.160 --> 03:13:31.400]  it's a crime, they are just obstructing and lying about everything. That's my point.
[03:13:31.400 --> 03:13:36.840]  They are clearly and presently saying when they get in control of the House and Senate,
[03:13:36.840 --> 03:13:41.320]  finance committees and other areas, they're going to sabotage the economy. I mean, at a certain
[03:13:41.320 --> 03:13:45.480]  point, we can't just sit there and take their criminal activity more. And that's what I'm saying,
[03:13:45.480 --> 03:13:51.320]  Roger. Well, the good news, of course, is that they only control one House of Congress. They do not
[03:13:51.320 --> 03:13:55.960]  control the Senate. They do not control the White House. But they're lawlessly running around engaging
[03:13:55.960 --> 03:14:02.360]  in all sorts of crime. Look, what does Senator need to do? I mean, we need to... They have ample
[03:14:02.360 --> 03:14:07.480]  evidence to indict Bill and Hillary Clinton. They want it... Those two want to kill the president.
[03:14:07.480 --> 03:14:11.560]  They're already criminals. So let's just take the gloves off and indict their asses right now.
[03:14:12.440 --> 03:14:16.920]  Well, I think that Acting Attorney General Whitaker should exercise his power to appoint
[03:14:16.920 --> 03:14:23.080]  a special prosecutor in the matter of Uranium One. That is the largest treasonous crime in U.S.
[03:14:23.080 --> 03:14:26.280]  history. We've talked about it extensively. And they're trying to run out of hold.
[03:14:26.280 --> 03:14:29.880]  And there's no statute of limitations, but there's been new crimes involved lying about it. So there
[03:14:29.880 --> 03:14:35.400]  isn't no statute. Well, the money continues to flow. Therefore, I would argue that the conspiracy
[03:14:35.400 --> 03:14:39.800]  is ongoing. And therefore, there is no statute of limitations. Also, there are no statute of
[03:14:39.800 --> 03:14:45.960]  limitations whatsoever on treason. And this is treasonous activity. If you want to hit the deep
[03:14:45.960 --> 03:14:52.360]  state right where it hurts, if you want to expedite the indictment of Bill and Hillary
[03:14:52.360 --> 03:14:58.600]  Clinton and all of their cohorts, including Mr. Mueller and perhaps the former president,
[03:14:58.600 --> 03:15:03.640]  then a real investigation into Uranium One, I think, is the appropriate move.
[03:15:04.920 --> 03:15:12.760]  He also basically ran Jerry Epstein and Jeffrey Epstein and the whole pedo op. So,
[03:15:12.760 --> 03:15:19.000]  I mean, Mr. Mueller, he needs to be massively investigated, because we know he is an arch
[03:15:19.000 --> 03:15:28.360]  criminal worse than anything in a Batman comic. And it's just Robert Mueller is unbelievable.
[03:15:28.360 --> 03:15:32.680]  And we've been exposing him today. I know you've got the latest on you as well, Roger,
[03:15:32.680 --> 03:15:37.320]  and Dr. Jerome Corsi. Though it turns out they're saying they're going to indict because he wouldn't
[03:15:37.320 --> 03:15:43.640]  lie about Roger Stone. So it turns out that Corsi is quite the guy for not rolling over.
[03:15:44.440 --> 03:15:47.160]  I think Corsi's a great guy. I never thought he would, but then he was having some of the health
[03:15:47.160 --> 03:15:58.920]  problems. I thought they might. Who knows? Do you want torturing? Who knows?
[03:16:17.160 --> 03:16:29.560]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the world.
[03:16:29.560 --> 03:16:35.160]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars. The United States of Empire shows that
[03:16:35.160 --> 03:16:42.280]  World Wars One and Two left England broken. Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[03:16:42.280 --> 03:16:47.800]  Was there ever a vote? Who do we fight for? The deep state began with World War One,
[03:16:47.800 --> 03:16:52.600]  the United States of Empire by James Dunne, available at Amazon Books.
[03:16:53.240 --> 03:16:56.840]  Pain in my neck, back, and shoulders has really gotten worse.

[03:17:53.960 --> 03:17:58.120]  The globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment
[03:17:58.120 --> 03:18:03.800]  full of the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromide, you name it, that it lowers IQ. It literally
[03:18:04.360 --> 03:18:09.400]  dumbs the population down. And on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers the best iodine
[03:18:09.400 --> 03:18:15.560]  in the world, we've gone through two permutations. First, seaweed-based iodine that was pretty good,
[03:18:15.560 --> 03:18:20.040]  but hard to source, and the globalists tried to block us getting a supply of it. So we discovered
[03:18:20.040 --> 03:18:25.800]  deep earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and brought UX2 that's been incredible. Now,
[03:18:25.800 --> 03:18:30.600]  due to the establishment trying to block that, we did more research and secured more of the
[03:18:30.600 --> 03:18:36.040]  deep earth crystals of nascent iodine. But chemists, scientists, and others showed us the research
[03:18:36.040 --> 03:18:42.520]  that by combining it with three other compounds, two forms of iodine and vitamin C, it supercharges
[03:18:42.520 --> 03:18:48.520]  it and makes it even more bioavailable. Ladies and gentlemen, you want to research it, you want
[03:18:48.520 --> 03:18:54.040]  to see it. It's an incredible discovery. X3, now available at m4slife.com.
[03:18:54.040 --> 03:18:59.160]  It's really hard to have the energy at the end of the day to still get to the gym or to go for a
[03:18:59.160 --> 03:19:04.840]  run or go to the park or heck, even take your dog for a walk. Believe me, I know I spend hours in
[03:19:04.840 --> 03:19:09.720]  front of a screen and then hours in front of bright lights every day. But thanks to Supermail
[03:19:09.720 --> 03:19:15.880]  Vitality at infowarstore.com, I still have that energy. There's no way I could have the energy

[03:19:20.760 --> 03:19:25.480]  against the modern day lifestyle with the screen time and the extended hours, to still have the
[03:19:25.480 --> 03:19:31.560]  stamina and endurance, energy, and drive to get to the gym, get to the park, and get exercise

[03:19:56.680 --> 03:19:59.320]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[03:19:59.320 --> 03:20:10.280]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[03:20:14.680 --> 03:20:19.160]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, again, Roger has two special guests coming up in the next
[03:20:19.160 --> 03:20:23.880]  two segments. One of them, a close confidant of the president to try to get you to take on how the
[03:20:23.880 --> 03:20:29.160]  president's doing under all these attacks. It seems only making him stronger. All he's trying to do
[03:20:29.160 --> 03:20:33.560]  is restore the republic, be a decent president for everybody. And it shows you how far gone our
[03:20:33.560 --> 03:20:37.960]  country was by globalists and foreign special interests that believe they have full control
[03:20:37.960 --> 03:20:42.280]  of this nation. They believe they own it, that they are now saying you can't even say the nation
[03:20:42.280 --> 03:20:46.920]  exists or you're bad. Not just here at home, but the president goes to France and gets told how
[03:20:46.920 --> 03:20:52.440]  bad he is and that nation states are bad and that true patriotism is not believing in your nation.
[03:20:52.440 --> 03:21:00.440]  That is truly 1984 come true. But Roger, I have a message to the president and I'm going to
[03:21:01.320 --> 03:21:05.320]  shoot it here in the next few days and make sure it gets to him. Make sure it gets to Don Jr.
[03:21:06.440 --> 03:21:11.960]  And I think the president already knows this, but he seems to like it when he gets a sounding
[03:21:11.960 --> 03:21:19.080]  board and kind of gets, you know, the same analysis back, especially when it's exactly what he's
[03:21:19.080 --> 03:21:25.560]  already thinking. Trump understands that they're going to destroy him if they're able to. He's
[03:21:25.560 --> 03:21:32.360]  now in a death battle. He's now in a total battle, total struggle. And his whole name is tied to this
[03:21:32.360 --> 03:21:37.560]  now. And he's either going to come out as the New George Washington 2.0, or he will be destroyed
[03:21:37.560 --> 03:21:42.040]  in the country along with him, which is the globalist plan. Regardless, he stepped in the way of
[03:21:42.040 --> 03:21:47.560]  this train for us. Whereas the globalists were sealing the vault door on us, imprisoning America
[03:21:47.560 --> 03:21:51.320]  in this globalist tomb. He stuck his foot in the door. They're smashing it off and he's saying,
[03:21:51.320 --> 03:21:56.600]  hey, everybody help me, help me. I can't hold the door much longer. And you and I are in that
[03:21:56.600 --> 03:22:03.720]  position. We're not heroes, but we metaphysically have to do this because we are truly loyal to the
[03:22:03.720 --> 03:22:09.240]  country and we're loyal to our ancestors and we're loyal to being honorable individuals.
[03:22:09.960 --> 03:22:13.000]  And that's why it's so hard to be called dishonorable by the dishonorable press
[03:22:13.000 --> 03:22:20.920]  who works for these absolutely wicked people who basically have no soul, like Robert Mueller and
[03:22:20.920 --> 03:22:26.600]  Hillary Clinton and others. And we know Hillary's going to run for office. She controls the party,
[03:22:26.600 --> 03:22:31.880]  she controls the foundations. But also, I know people that have been at the meetings when she's
[03:22:31.880 --> 03:22:39.800]  there in the last two months with Michelle Obama and Obama and it's a done deal. And now they may
[03:22:39.800 --> 03:22:43.720]  change it, but right now it's a done deal. And I got contacted by high-level folks and then I
[03:22:43.720 --> 03:22:48.520]  got a visit saying, you need to cover this. This is real. Notice now she's saying, oh, yes, I may
[03:22:48.520 --> 03:22:55.320]  run now because she sees the signal of the weakness of the Republicans not going after this election
[03:22:55.320 --> 03:23:01.560]  fraud and keeping these election areas open and breaking all these rules. They see that as a green
[03:23:01.560 --> 03:23:05.560]  light as a dress rehearsal as Congressman Matt Gaetz has said. We'll play that Matt Gaetz clip
[03:23:05.560 --> 03:23:12.920]  here in a moment. And so we're faced with such naked criminality that it seems radical if we get
[03:23:12.920 --> 03:23:16.520]  really aggressive politically, economically, and through the criminal justice system. But
[03:23:16.520 --> 03:23:21.480]  this is self-defense. So if we don't get really aggressive and if the president doesn't get really
[03:23:21.480 --> 03:23:24.920]  aggressive, I know he's surrounded by a bunch of cowards, he's trying to get some good people in
[03:23:24.920 --> 03:23:32.600]  now, we're doomed. And now it's beyond the country. These globalists are so bad, it's about the whole
[03:23:32.600 --> 03:23:38.200]  planet and what they'll do seizing America. So it's now gut check time to decide what side of
[03:23:38.200 --> 03:23:42.440]  history we're on for the military, the police, everybody. And I'm not trying to give orders
[03:23:42.440 --> 03:23:48.200]  here. I don't know exactly what we should do. I'm just saying the death con has gone up. We are in
[03:23:49.240 --> 03:23:54.760]  really bad situation here. And if they get left alone to engage in these crimes,
[03:23:54.760 --> 03:24:01.720]  they're going to double it again. And then that's going to trigger a giant conflagration,
[03:24:01.720 --> 03:24:06.600]  which I don't want. I just want the globalists and all their stolen money to stop trying to
[03:24:06.600 --> 03:24:11.960]  strangle the country in a pissing contest. But they're mad dogs and you know in criminology
[03:24:13.080 --> 03:24:17.160]  that psychopaths and others at first are more skilled. But then as they get away with it,
[03:24:17.160 --> 03:24:21.160]  they get more emboldened because they're subconsciously, their conscious is evil,
[03:24:21.160 --> 03:24:25.880]  part of their subconscious is evil too. But the basic human programming still in them wants them
[03:24:25.880 --> 03:24:29.480]  to destroy themselves, wants them to kill themselves because they're not good for humanity. So that's
[03:24:29.480 --> 03:24:35.640]  why the psychos sabotage themselves is because their own body is trying to stop them. Well,
[03:24:36.600 --> 03:24:42.920]  so all I'm saying is we're giving license to all this and it's time to really get
[03:24:42.920 --> 03:24:47.240]  aggressive. I don't know exactly what that is, but I'm telling the president he has my full
[03:24:47.240 --> 03:24:53.160]  backing for whatever needs to be done. Roger. You know, Alex, I think the prospects for victory
[03:24:53.160 --> 03:25:00.280]  are absolutely zero unless we have a fully accessible internet. The internet was the vehicle
[03:25:00.280 --> 03:25:05.320]  that allowed Donald Trump to pull off the most improbable victory in American political history.
[03:25:05.320 --> 03:25:12.280]  The internet has driven this truth telling revolution, which is why info wars is in the
[03:25:12.280 --> 03:25:19.960]  is in the crosshairs and why the internet based censorship by the tech left cost us in the last
[03:25:19.960 --> 03:25:26.200]  election. The single most important thing anybody can do right now to back up the president is to
[03:25:26.200 --> 03:25:36.200]  go to write trump.com. That's right. Trump like the word W R I T E trump.com and help us here at
[03:25:36.200 --> 03:25:42.440]  info wars deliver one million letters to the president. He has no chance of victory if he does
[03:25:42.440 --> 03:25:49.960]  not have a level playing field on the internet. We've seen that graphically in the last election,
[03:25:49.960 --> 03:25:56.200]  and now it's time for action. So if you are teed off, if you're angry, if you're upset about these
[03:25:56.200 --> 03:26:02.120]  elections, if you're worried about 2020, if you're furious at the left and their announcement of
[03:26:02.120 --> 03:26:08.440]  85 individual investigations into Donald Trump and you want to do something about it, now is your
[03:26:08.440 --> 03:26:16.840]  chance. Go to write trump.com, help Alex Jones, help me, help yourself, help info wars, help the
[03:26:16.840 --> 03:26:25.080]  entire pro freedom internet based movement and end the net censorship so that we can compete
[03:26:25.080 --> 03:26:30.200]  in the marketplace of ideas. There is no more important thing for the president to do is to
[03:26:30.200 --> 03:26:36.840]  guarantee his ability to communicate in the coming fight. He cripples himself as he allowed us to be
[03:26:36.840 --> 03:26:43.640]  crippled in the last election. Then surely his the future of his presidency, the prospects of
[03:26:43.640 --> 03:26:51.160]  his reform agenda, his prospects for reelection, indeed his legacy can be flushed. If on the other
[03:26:51.160 --> 03:26:59.480]  hand we have a free, open, robust and vibrant internet where info wars is unfettered, I believe
[03:26:59.480 --> 03:27:05.000]  we will win and because we have truth on our side. And let me add this, a congressman shift
[03:27:05.000 --> 03:27:12.360]  who will now run the intelligence committee in the house. He has said he's going to investigate
[03:27:12.360 --> 03:27:19.880]  how Trump's been mean to Jeff Bezos who literally gets $48,000 of taxpayer money for each employee
[03:27:19.880 --> 03:27:25.560]  he has more than they're paid in many cases. That's all over drudgerport.com today. This guy
[03:27:25.560 --> 03:27:31.960]  who owns the Washington Post and who's openly trying to literally destroy Main Street, this guy,
[03:27:31.960 --> 03:27:36.120]  they're about to turn it around like Trump's being mean to the press and Trump's being mean to Jeff
[03:27:36.120 --> 03:27:41.960]  Bezos. This is like saying the allies are being mean to Hitler. So he has to go on the offense,
[03:27:41.960 --> 03:27:46.760]  the lame duck congress, the next two months. It needs to get angry and also point out the
[03:27:46.760 --> 03:27:51.480]  election fraud. The democrats said the election was illegitimate with no proof. We have evidence
[03:27:51.480 --> 03:27:57.320]  that the republicans actually stayed in to the combination of fraud and first amendment suppression,
[03:27:57.320 --> 03:28:03.320]  voter suppression, election meddling did this. So let's go on the offense. I got to say congressman
[03:28:03.320 --> 03:28:08.360]  Matt Gaetz has been on fire as of late. So have others. I think Jim Jordan should get the leadership
[03:28:08.360 --> 03:28:15.240]  position in the house. What do you think? I totally agree. We need a firebrand like Jim Jordan. What
[03:28:15.240 --> 03:28:20.920]  we don't need is an old fashioned establishment, blue blood, go along to get along republican.
[03:28:20.920 --> 03:28:26.920]  It's time to fight. The Trump majority, the Trump majority coalition in the country is still
[03:28:26.920 --> 03:28:33.240]  the majority. And we can win the 2020 election and we can enact the rest of his agenda, but not
[03:28:33.240 --> 03:28:38.920]  without a clamp on internet censorship. That's right. We said 2018 was the most important election
[03:28:38.920 --> 03:28:44.920]  in world history. 2020 if we lose could be the last election because the bubbles won nuclear war.
[03:28:44.920 --> 03:28:49.000]  They're not going to allow freedom. They're going to sell it all up. This is America's brightest,
[03:28:49.000 --> 03:28:53.720]  but also darkest hour. Whatever you do, spread the live links and get around the censors. Hi,

[03:33:20.360 --> 03:33:32.840]  Welcome back. I'm Roger Stone and this is the Alex Jones show. I'm joining you from our Miami
[03:33:32.840 --> 03:33:40.360]  studio. So the Wall Street Journal is now reporting that Robert Mueller is investigating whether I
[03:33:40.360 --> 03:33:46.280]  tried to intimidate Randy Kredeco when in fact it was Randy Kredeco who tried to intimidate me.
[03:33:46.280 --> 03:33:54.120]  Within the next 24 hours, the absolute stone cold proof will be there for everyone to see.
[03:33:54.680 --> 03:34:00.680]  Absolute proof that Kredeco was my source regarding the WikiLeaks disclosures. Absolute
[03:34:00.680 --> 03:34:07.240]  proof that Kredeco says in his own words that his source is a WikiLeaks woman lawyer that he
[03:34:07.240 --> 03:34:17.000]  identifies and that he was telling me what was going down. Stand by for that. Now joining us is
[03:34:17.000 --> 03:34:25.320]  one of my favorite guests. Tana Gertz is a personal friend of Donald Trump, one of the earliest
[03:34:25.320 --> 03:34:33.160]  contestants on The Apprentice, who later emerged as a key strategist and organizer for the president's
[03:34:33.160 --> 03:34:40.440]  Iowa campaign. And of course, Iowa is the first step in the Republican primaries and caucuses
[03:34:40.440 --> 03:34:47.000]  that lead to the national convention and in the case of Donald Trump to the White House. So
[03:34:47.000 --> 03:34:53.320]  Tana was there at the beginning and she joins us now. Welcome to the Alex Jones show.
[03:34:54.040 --> 03:34:57.400]  Thanks for having me, Roger, and I appreciate those kind words.
[03:34:57.400 --> 03:35:06.520]  Well, you know, the thing I like about you is that you are typical of the kind of non-politician,
[03:35:06.520 --> 03:35:13.160]  non-political insider who was attracted to Donald Trump's candidacy from the beginning. I think,
[03:35:13.160 --> 03:35:21.800]  like me, you saw in him someone who was bigger than either party, bigger than any one political
[03:35:21.800 --> 03:35:29.080]  philosophy, a problem solver, a pragmatist who believes deeply in America and could cut through
[03:35:29.080 --> 03:35:37.640]  the BS of politics to actually get something done and look at the results. 4.2 million new jobs,
[03:35:37.640 --> 03:35:45.480]  record wage growth, unemployment at the lowest point in American history, a record stock market,
[03:35:45.480 --> 03:35:52.280]  billions pouring back into the country to be invested here, to start companies here, to create
[03:35:52.280 --> 03:36:00.760]  jobs here. But if you believe the LA Times, the president's been in a dark mood since the election.
[03:36:00.760 --> 03:36:07.400]  The president has been angry since the election. That's not what I'm hearing. Tana, what are you
[03:36:07.400 --> 03:36:14.120]  hearing? You're 100% right. That's not the president that we know and love. We know exactly
[03:36:14.120 --> 03:36:19.640]  what Donald Trump is doing. He's strategizing to make America better again and great again.
[03:36:19.640 --> 03:36:29.000]  And you're 100% right. 4.5 million jobs since he has been in office. We don't even want to go over
[03:36:29.000 --> 03:36:35.320]  what our previous president did. Manufacturing jobs were going overseas and nobody cared about it.
[03:36:35.320 --> 03:36:40.440]  So I fell in love with him knowing, yes, he was going to be the builder of America. Who better
[03:36:40.440 --> 03:36:45.560]  than Donald Trump to rebuild America? But getting back to your question about, do I think he has
[03:36:45.560 --> 03:36:51.960]  a dark mood? I know I laugh at when I read these articles saying, oh, the caravan and what Donald
[03:36:51.960 --> 03:36:57.480]  Trump was going to do was just for midterms. It was just a political move. And I'm like, oh,
[03:36:57.480 --> 03:37:03.320]  actually, that couldn't be the furthest from the truth. He is actually taking aggressive measures
[03:37:03.320 --> 03:37:11.000]  to ensure that people enter our country legally. And so no, he's not in any dark mood. You can't
[03:37:11.000 --> 03:37:17.640]  have the stamina that he has and be dark. And that's just a joke. So that doesn't bother me at all.
[03:37:17.640 --> 03:37:23.160]  And we both know what he's capable of doing. And the Democrats and really anybody out there who
[03:37:23.160 --> 03:37:28.920]  doesn't want a better America is terrified of what he's going to do and how much better he's
[03:37:28.920 --> 03:37:34.360]  going to actually do for our country. What is your opinion of the stunning move in which he
[03:37:34.360 --> 03:37:40.120]  wrenched control of his Justice Department away from Rod Rosenstein and inserted Acting Attorney
[03:37:40.120 --> 03:37:46.600]  General Matthew Whitaker? Now, you're from Iowa, which is where Matthew Whitaker is from. Tell us
[03:37:46.600 --> 03:37:53.000]  your assessment of the man. I think it was a great move. I think it shows also, once again,
[03:37:53.000 --> 03:38:00.040]  President Trump is a wise man, and he put in the right guy. Matt has got a great reputation here
[03:38:00.040 --> 03:38:07.400]  in Iowa. He is tough. He's got a great reputation of being a good lawyer. He's not a wimp. And
[03:38:07.400 --> 03:38:13.240]  that's exactly what I want in the administration. That's what I wanted in my president. I didn't
[03:38:13.240 --> 03:38:18.920]  hire him or ask him, you know, I didn't vote for him to be a preacher. I voted for him to be,
[03:38:18.920 --> 03:38:25.720]  you know, I don't care. I'm going to watch my words. I voted for him to be my president,
[03:38:25.720 --> 03:38:32.520]  not my preacher. And I love the fact that he's got guts and he doesn't care what anybody says,
[03:38:32.520 --> 03:38:37.320]  and he doesn't care how he says it. And I don't care about his tone. And that's exactly what
[03:38:37.320 --> 03:38:43.160]  we're going to find in Matt. As I mentioned, he's got a great reputation here in Iowa. He's smart
[03:38:43.160 --> 03:38:50.040]  and he's tough, huh? Very similar to our president, very similar to you and I, Roger. Well, those
[03:38:50.040 --> 03:38:58.280]  are the qualities that are going to be needed because the deep state Congressman Jerry Nadler
[03:38:58.280 --> 03:39:04.200]  and Congressman Adam Schiff, Senator Chuck Schumer, they're furious that the president has taken his
[03:39:04.200 --> 03:39:11.000]  Justice Department back. They are furious that he has essentially taken Rod Rosenstein out of
[03:39:11.000 --> 03:39:16.680]  the loop and reasserted his control of his own Justice Department, which had to be one of the
[03:39:16.680 --> 03:39:22.680]  dirtiest tricks that I had seen. And everybody's waiting for the other shoe to drop, particularly
[03:39:22.680 --> 03:39:29.720]  since the jet was revealed today, that the Justice Department was consulted in advance and essentially
[03:39:29.720 --> 03:39:35.640]  authorized the president to make this appointment in the sense that they said it was legally binding
[03:39:35.640 --> 03:39:41.400]  and that there were 160 previous incidents where this mattered. Now, let's go to the issue of
[03:39:41.400 --> 03:39:46.680]  internet censorship because I know you're very, very active on social media. You have a huge
[03:39:46.680 --> 03:39:53.160]  following on Twitter and Facebook and Instagram and so on. Do you think that the internet
[03:39:53.160 --> 03:39:59.240]  censorship played as big a role in the recent loosing of the house as Alex Jones and I believe it did?
[03:39:59.240 --> 03:40:06.440]  I actually do believe that because it's just so funny. When I go to hashtag MAGA or go to
[03:40:06.440 --> 03:40:12.440]  hashtag midterm elections or Republican or woman for Trump, it's funny. I don't, I'm not able to
[03:40:12.440 --> 03:40:18.520]  oppose that. It's just, I mean, I have to do 15,000 attempts to get one post up. Yet, you know,
[03:40:18.520 --> 03:40:23.640]  I see the opposing side, people that I go up against on television, they're able to pose till
[03:40:23.640 --> 03:40:30.200]  the cows come home. So yes, the censorship is terrible. It's scary because, you know, that's
[03:40:30.200 --> 03:40:36.520]  how we won by Donald Trump being able to reach so many Americans as well as people like yourself
[03:40:36.520 --> 03:40:42.840]  and I, freedom of speech, getting out there, Alex getting out there with info wars. We need that
[03:40:42.840 --> 03:40:49.800]  platform to let the public know the real man, the president that we all voted for, the majority of us
[03:40:49.800 --> 03:40:56.440]  did 63 million plus, but who's counting? And so absolutely, this is a very important issue
[03:40:56.440 --> 03:41:02.440]  that we all have to take into account. And I always say after every, every video I do or
[03:41:02.440 --> 03:41:08.760]  anything, please share, let the videos get legs. So when I share something of yours, Roger, then
[03:41:08.760 --> 03:41:14.840]  my whole following of 100,000 people sees it and I tell them, please share and share and share.
[03:41:14.840 --> 03:41:21.000]  So I agree with you that we are in a tight spot and we will win, but we need our army behind us.
[03:41:22.280 --> 03:41:27.720]  All right, Tana Gertz, a breath of fresh air, a close personal friend of the president and the
[03:41:27.720 --> 03:41:33.240]  first family, one of the most outspoken and effective advocates for the Trump presidency out
[03:41:33.240 --> 03:41:39.320]  there. Thank you for joining us here on the Alex Jones show. Thank you and we will see you again.
[03:41:39.320 --> 03:41:45.640]  I hope so. Thanks for having me, Roger. Take care. Many thanks. In the meantime, folks,
[03:41:45.640 --> 03:41:50.760]  I want to remind you the Alex Jones show is brought to you only through your loyal patronage
[03:41:50.760 --> 03:41:57.160]  at the Infowars.com store. We're fighting the challenges as never before. It's not just
[03:41:57.160 --> 03:42:02.440]  internet censorship, but it's fooling with our banking, monkeying with our ability to
[03:42:02.440 --> 03:42:08.520]  conduct commerce with you, not to mention the multimillion dollar harassment lawsuits
[03:42:08.520 --> 03:42:14.440]  that Alex Jones has to combat. So please go to the Infowars.com site now and look at some of these
[03:42:14.440 --> 03:42:22.520]  unbelievable blowout specials. My all time favorite, Brain Force Plus, now at 50% off.
[03:42:22.520 --> 03:42:31.640]  The new X3, the finest natural iodine you can find in the marketplace at extraordinary prices.
[03:42:31.640 --> 03:42:39.640]  We need your help as never before. Please go to the Infowars.com store now and have our back.
[03:42:39.640 --> 03:42:46.040]  Believe me, your purchases make George Soros very, very unhappy. I'll be right back.
[03:42:52.920 --> 03:42:57.080]  The globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment
[03:42:57.080 --> 03:43:02.760]  full of the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromide, you name it, that it lowers IQ. It literally
[03:43:03.320 --> 03:43:08.440]  dumbs the population down. And on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers the best iodine
[03:43:08.440 --> 03:43:14.520]  in the world, we've gone through two permutations. First, seaweed based iodine that was pretty good,
[03:43:14.520 --> 03:43:19.000]  but hard to source. And the globalists tried to block us getting a supply of it. So we discovered
[03:43:19.000 --> 03:43:23.800]  deep earth crystals, a pure nascent iodine and brought you X2. That's been incredible.
[03:43:23.800 --> 03:43:29.160]  Now, due to the establishment trying to block that, we did more research and secured
[03:43:29.160 --> 03:43:33.960]  more of the deep earth crystals of nascent iodine. But chemists, scientists and others
[03:43:33.960 --> 03:43:39.160]  showed us the research that by combining it with three other compounds, two forms of iodine
[03:43:39.160 --> 03:43:45.480]  and vitamin C, it supercharges it and makes it even more bioavailable.
[03:43:45.480 --> 03:43:49.640]  Ladies and gentlemen, you want to research it, you want to see it, it's an incredible discovery.
[03:43:49.640 --> 03:43:56.040]  X3 now available at M4sLife.com. Please, whatever you do, realize that we're all getting punch
[03:43:56.040 --> 03:44:01.000]  drunk to the censorship. And you saw 18 Twitter accounts, they say affiliated with M4s. Yes,
[03:44:01.000 --> 03:44:05.080]  some of them are like little side accounts. They even know we had like M4 stores that just showed
[03:44:05.080 --> 03:44:10.680]  our products, but they just banned them all yesterday in punishment that I be at a Trump rally and be
[03:44:10.680 --> 03:44:14.760]  mobbed by all these folks that loved us. Your excitement about America, your excitement about
[03:44:14.760 --> 03:44:18.680]  this broadcast is what brought the country and the world back from the brick. But the globalists
[03:44:18.680 --> 03:44:24.040]  now want to target where the resistance came from so that we're not pesky in the future.
[03:44:24.040 --> 03:44:30.520]  I want to be troublesome and pesky. I want to keep going. I want to make them do the ultimate,
[03:44:30.520 --> 03:44:35.320]  not just destroy us financially. I want to push all the way. I've committed to do that.
[03:44:35.320 --> 03:44:39.800]  I've prayed for that and I've been told that's going to happen, but you've got a backish and I
[03:44:39.800 --> 03:44:45.560]  promise you this. I will never falter. I will never waver at the spiritual level. I physically will,
[03:44:45.560 --> 03:44:50.840]  but I give you my commitment if you financially support us at FullerStore.com to give you my
[03:44:50.840 --> 03:44:58.040]  absolute total commitment. We are kept afloat only by your loyal patronage,

[03:46:59.800 --> 03:47:15.720]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Roger Stone. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[03:47:18.360 --> 03:47:24.200]  You know, I agree with Alex Jones. I think that music is a little sleepy for the excitement that
[03:47:24.200 --> 03:47:32.360]  is the Alex Jones show. I'm Roger Stone sitting in for Alex Jones and now joining me is Tyler Nixon,
[03:47:32.360 --> 03:47:40.360]  who is not only an army veteran, an attorney, a libertarian activist, a writer, an author,
[03:47:40.360 --> 03:47:46.680]  but also one of my personal attorneys and in all honesty, one of my closest friends. Tyler,
[03:47:46.680 --> 03:47:51.800]  welcome to the Alex Jones show. It's great to be with you, Roger and on the Alex Jones show
[03:47:51.800 --> 03:48:00.120]  and I'm in for wars as always. So you had quite a bit of news yesterday because you were among
[03:48:00.120 --> 03:48:07.560]  those who went to the Muller Grand Jury two Fridays ago and why don't you tell us what you experienced?
[03:48:09.080 --> 03:48:14.680]  Well, you know, it was interesting because what I was expecting was sort of the boogeyman
[03:48:15.320 --> 03:48:19.640]  factor. You know, you look at these folks from a distance, you see what they're doing, what I've
[03:48:19.640 --> 03:48:25.640]  seen them do to you, what I've seen them do to other people and I feel a burning sense of injustice
[03:48:25.640 --> 03:48:31.480]  with it because I think it's been complete hoax, a witch hunt, whatever any term you want to use
[03:48:31.480 --> 03:48:38.200]  for it. It's not a legitimate investigation. What it is, a charade intended to obscure the reality
[03:48:38.200 --> 03:48:44.200]  that went on in the 2016 election, which was the abuse of FISA warrants and the massive national
[03:48:44.200 --> 03:48:50.920]  security surveillance powers to spy on a presidential candidate and his inner circle as well as beyond
[03:48:50.920 --> 03:48:56.760]  that in an unprecedented abuse of power, as you've pointed out many, many times on here, Roger.
[03:48:56.760 --> 03:49:00.840]  And, you know, for that level of unprecedented abuse of power, there's going to have to be an
[03:49:00.840 --> 03:49:06.920]  unprecedented abuse of cover up. And that's exactly what we see in the Muller probe that is dragged
[03:49:06.920 --> 03:49:12.040]  on far longer than any legitimate criminal investigation would. I mean, there are mafia,
[03:49:12.040 --> 03:49:17.400]  you know, organized criminal organizations. You look at El Chapo, how many years it took them to
[03:49:17.400 --> 03:49:23.880]  bring him to trial. But, you know, what they've gone into with Muller is really just sidebar
[03:49:23.880 --> 03:49:28.760]  stuff at best. I mean, in your case, there's nothing there whatsoever. And it's laughable to
[03:49:28.760 --> 03:49:35.000]  me that they have dragged in more of your associates and confidants and people close to you than any
[03:49:35.000 --> 03:49:40.920]  other person probably who has been in the target sites of this man and his Democrat hit squad.
[03:49:40.920 --> 03:49:46.520]  As I was questioned by Jeannie Rhee, the Clinton's lawyer, I mean, how do you justify having Hillary
[03:49:46.520 --> 03:49:52.840]  Clinton's lawyer and the Clinton Foundation's lawyer questioning and examining Roger Stone's
[03:49:52.840 --> 03:49:58.440]  attorney or someone close to Roger Stone, who, you know, as I've said, you wrote the Clinton's
[03:49:58.440 --> 03:50:04.680]  War on Women. You have been a longtime opponent and adversary of the Clintons. So, you know,
[03:50:04.680 --> 03:50:09.880]  just the appearance alone of improprieties like that is enough to really, well, you know,
[03:50:09.880 --> 03:50:14.280]  it's not even necessarily the appearance, it's the fact that they disregard it. These are supposed
[03:50:14.280 --> 03:50:19.480]  to be the top attorneys in the country. Ms. Rhee is a double Yale graduate. The fact that she would
[03:50:19.480 --> 03:50:25.320]  just blow off the fact that she worked for the person who you went after in the election,
[03:50:25.320 --> 03:50:30.440]  who was the opposition candidate to the people who were being investigated, you know, is enough to
[03:50:30.440 --> 03:50:35.960]  me to say this is not the fix is in. This is not legitimate. And it's dragged on far too long.
[03:50:35.960 --> 03:50:41.640]  Even Jeff Sessions on his way out the door after being essentially terminated said it is really,
[03:50:41.640 --> 03:50:45.640]  it's really bad for the country how long this thing is dragged out. And it shows you exactly why
[03:50:45.640 --> 03:50:50.840]  because now they've won Congress and they're going to hand it off to, you know, shift at all. And I'm
[03:50:50.840 --> 03:50:55.960]  sure Mueller will just ride into the sunset. But it's a disgrace and a disgusting abuse of power
[03:50:55.960 --> 03:51:03.080]  as bad as the Obama, Clinton and administration's FISA, you know, FISA surveillance on the,
[03:51:03.080 --> 03:51:09.160]  you know, you and others. Well, I would relish the opportunity to match wits with Adam Schiff,
[03:51:09.160 --> 03:51:15.560]  but then I don't want to fight an unarmed man. What's even more egregious here, Tyler, is the
[03:51:15.560 --> 03:51:22.040]  fact that Jeannie Ray, who is now serving as a prosecutor for Mr. Mueller, questioning witnesses
[03:51:22.040 --> 03:51:29.000]  about me before the grand jury represented Hillary Clinton specifically in the missing email illegal
[03:51:29.000 --> 03:51:34.440]  server case, which is one of the matters in which I am under investigation, even though
[03:51:34.440 --> 03:51:40.520]  I know nothing whatsoever about it. So it's an egregious material conflict. It's not just an
[03:51:40.520 --> 03:51:46.360]  appearance of conflict because Ms. Ray happens to be a Democrat and I happen to be a Republican.
[03:51:46.360 --> 03:51:52.440]  She has a material conflict, which of course, I'm certain, should they make the mistake of making
[03:51:52.440 --> 03:51:59.480]  some illegitimate move against me, having found no Russian collusion, no WikiLeaks collaboration.
[03:52:00.040 --> 03:52:06.040]  Today, there's a nonsensical story saying that I sought to intimidate Randy Kredico,
[03:52:06.040 --> 03:52:10.600]  which is funny because this is the same Randy Kredico who threatened to put a hole in the head
[03:52:10.600 --> 03:52:17.880]  of David Lugo, who testified honestly before the grand jury as to the fact that Kredico confirmed
[03:52:17.880 --> 03:52:26.200]  that he was my source. Stand by because it will be proven in the next 24 hours, indisputably,
[03:52:26.200 --> 03:52:34.520]  that Randy Kredico, in his own words, admitted that he was my source. It's a travesty. It's
[03:52:34.520 --> 03:52:41.480]  really an extraordinary miscarriage of justice. But the incredible financial and personal pressure
[03:52:41.480 --> 03:52:48.120]  this has put me under is the real story. Look, I'm like Alex Jones. I'm tough. I'm a warrior.
[03:52:48.120 --> 03:52:54.600]  This isn't about me. This is about the future of America. But the pressure it's put my family under,
[03:52:54.600 --> 03:53:00.840]  the financial pressure that they seek to put you under so that you ultimately plead guilty to some
[03:53:00.840 --> 03:53:06.360]  lesser crime that you did not commit, like General Flynn, who I think is a great patriot,
[03:53:06.360 --> 03:53:12.360]  who I think did nothing wrong, but he lost his home. He lost his savings. They threatened to indict
[03:53:12.360 --> 03:53:18.520]  his son, and he ultimately pled guilty to something I don't think he's guilty of. Perhaps that's
[03:53:18.520 --> 03:53:24.840]  what they have in mind for Roger Stone, but I don't intend to go down that road. I've had no
[03:53:24.840 --> 03:53:30.600]  choice, as you know, but to set up a legal defense fund. People who want to help me, people who are
[03:53:30.600 --> 03:53:36.760]  outraged at the Clinton's personal henchwoman, that Hillary Clinton's legal attack dog is
[03:53:36.760 --> 03:53:44.040]  leading the charge for the Mueller team against Roger Stone, can go to StoneDefenseFund.com.
[03:53:44.040 --> 03:53:52.360]  StoneDefenseFund.com. There you see it. I need help as never before. I'm deeply grateful for
[03:53:52.360 --> 03:53:58.280]  everything that many have done for me through the legal defense fund, but my life is now in
[03:53:58.280 --> 03:54:03.560]  your hands. Please help me with this important fight. Tyler is giving me the best legal advice
[03:54:03.560 --> 03:54:10.360]  you could have. I have other extraordinarily talented and capable lawyers, Grant Smith, Rob
[03:54:10.360 --> 03:54:19.720]  Bouchel, Tara Palmeri, and Bruce Rogau, as well as Tyler Nixon, but I'm fighting an unlimited
[03:54:19.720 --> 03:54:27.480]  budget of the federal government. I am fighting a platoon of Ivy League educated, smart-ass,
[03:54:27.480 --> 03:54:35.080]  liberal lawyers. And to paraphrase Bob Dylan, it says, if Robert Mueller has said to them,
[03:54:35.080 --> 03:54:42.760]  everybody must get stoned. Yeah. I'll tell you this also, Roger. I can test to those who would
[03:54:42.760 --> 03:54:49.240]  donate to your defense fund, and I urge you to do so. We have run a lean team, meaning we have
[03:54:49.240 --> 03:54:56.680]  done Yeoman's work, especially Rob Bouchel and Grant Smith, in terms of really getting the most
[03:54:56.680 --> 03:55:03.080]  out of what our work is and being up against it. It's just an army of unlimited resources and
[03:55:03.080 --> 03:55:09.800]  prosecutors. I mean, for example, in my case, I was flown from Colorado to Washington. This is
[03:55:09.800 --> 03:55:15.640]  after two FBI agents were flown to Colorado and to Las Vegas, and then back to Washington. I was
[03:55:15.640 --> 03:55:22.280]  put up in a hotel. I mean, it probably cost 20-some thousand dollars for them just to elicit my 20
[03:55:22.280 --> 03:55:26.520]  minutes of testimony and to sit there with the prosecutors. You can imagine, I mean, they just
[03:55:26.520 --> 03:55:32.520]  don't care how much they spend. In your case, though, look, I mean, it's difficult also on top
[03:55:32.520 --> 03:55:39.320]  of being pursued. I mean, I can imagine you've got situations where it's difficult to get the
[03:55:39.320 --> 03:55:46.120]  usual work that you did, the consultancy and so forth, when you've got this constant overhanging
[03:55:46.120 --> 03:55:51.160]  investigation, and this is really the point of it, Roger. They want to drag it out, and it's true,
[03:55:51.160 --> 03:55:57.480]  to destroy you, to break your back, to, you know, you've lost employees over this. People who worked,
[03:55:57.480 --> 03:56:02.760]  you know, who were close to you, who were drawn in and dragged into this complete farce of an
[03:56:02.760 --> 03:56:07.480]  investigation, and they are trying to destroy you, and they've got unlimited resources, and I think
[03:56:07.480 --> 03:56:13.320]  it's a disgusting thing that they're doing. I just, I'm appalled. It really bothers me, and not just
[03:56:13.320 --> 03:56:17.720]  from the perspective of you're being a friend of mine, but from the perspective of justice, and the
[03:56:17.720 --> 03:56:23.400]  fact that we should never have a government that can just arbitrarily and unilaterally break people
[03:56:23.400 --> 03:56:29.320]  just because, just because they're the people in charge. I mean, Bob Mueller, this man is detestable.
[03:56:29.320 --> 03:56:33.400]  I'm sorry, I don't care. I went to the University of Virginia as well, and let me tell you something.
[03:56:33.400 --> 03:56:38.680]  I don't care how many people pat him on the back and think, sing his hosannas, and think he walks on
[03:56:38.680 --> 03:56:43.640]  water. His actions, letting this thing go on as long as it has, and not answering to the public
[03:56:43.640 --> 03:56:48.920]  either, this big thing about being silent, BS on that, you should, he should step up and have to
[03:56:48.920 --> 03:56:53.560]  answer to the public for all the conflicts of interest for starters, the millions of dollars,
[03:56:53.560 --> 03:56:58.440]  why this is dragged on, you know, this veil of secrecy and silence that they hide behind,
[03:56:59.080 --> 03:57:02.760]  you know, it reminds me of the Bush Cheney administration, you know, Cheney, he would
[03:57:02.760 --> 03:57:06.520]  sit back, they wouldn't answer to anybody, they just did what the hell they wanted, and it, you
[03:57:06.520 --> 03:57:10.040]  know, it comes as no surprise that Mueller acts this way, because he was their cover-up artist,
[03:57:10.040 --> 03:57:14.360]  frankly, for a lot that went on during his administration, and the Obama administration
[03:57:14.360 --> 03:57:19.160]  identified him as someone who would, you know, go along with the program, let's say, and certainly
[03:57:19.160 --> 03:57:23.960]  the Clintons, you know, during the 90s with, you know, all that went on there, Mueller was around.
[03:57:23.960 --> 03:57:29.640]  Mueller is a creature of the swamp, and I don't care how many people tell me that he is, you know,
[03:57:29.640 --> 03:57:36.120]  the greatest thing since sliced bread in Washington, D.C., his conduct in this is a blight on his career
[03:57:36.120 --> 03:57:40.360]  and on this country. All right, I'm afraid we have to leave it there. Thank you, Tyler Nixon,
