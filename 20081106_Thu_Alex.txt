[01:43.880 --> 01:50.200]  you're a piece of trash I'm like hey he has the same cabinet the same elite the
[01:50.200 --> 01:53.840]  same policies he's a puppet don't you understand everything I do is about
[01:53.840 --> 01:58.640]  exposing the shadow government you know we know what we're talking about we
[01:58.640 --> 02:02.360]  predict years before exactly what's gonna happen in the controlled economic
[02:02.360 --> 02:05.280]  collapse and how they're gonna call for a new world order run by the private
[02:05.280 --> 02:10.600]  banks with world regulatory systems and world currency and it's happening I
[02:10.600 --> 02:16.680]  mean we're we're right about everything basically we go off the globalist
[02:16.680 --> 02:21.120]  documents the white papers the real government and you're mad at us because
[02:21.120 --> 02:27.280]  we won't play in your delusional world every time I bash WWF wrestling and say
[02:27.280 --> 02:31.040]  it's fake I mean any fool knows that I get grown men emailing me threatening me
[02:31.040 --> 02:35.120]  you're an idiot you're a liar or really I sat around with Jesse Ventura for 30
[02:35.120 --> 02:39.520]  minutes he talked about how it's all staged I mean like I need Ventura to
[02:39.520 --> 02:44.320]  tell me it was there at the start of the WWF that it's all fake he said the
[02:44.320 --> 02:47.520]  number one rule they teach you in wrestling is treat your opponent's
[02:47.520 --> 02:53.640]  body like it's your own and then it's basically like a dance it's it's it's
[02:53.640 --> 02:58.560]  art I don't particularly like it it's ridiculous and hilarious but the point
[02:58.560 --> 03:04.120]  is it is it is performance art it's acrobatic performance art and that's
[03:04.120 --> 03:07.040]  what he was you know sitting around talking about with us like we needed it
[03:07.040 --> 03:14.400]  Jesse Ventura to tell us that it's the same thing you're like you're like 10
[03:14.400 --> 03:20.360]  year old children going no wrestling's real you can pile drive somebody's head
[03:20.360 --> 03:24.640]  from eight feet off the ground and they didn't break their neck nothing I mean
[03:24.640 --> 03:32.880]  it's so childish because a 10-year-old hasn't been in a fight they
[03:32.880 --> 03:37.000]  haven't seen somebody really pile-drived in real life and seen the head
[03:37.000 --> 03:43.560]  split open and the person go to the hospital and almost die one time this
[03:43.560 --> 03:48.520]  guy started to fight with me and I beat him up pretty bad then his cousin the
[03:48.520 --> 03:52.120]  state wrestling champion and his weight came up to me and started to fight with
[03:52.120 --> 03:56.240]  me and I was like hey man then they got punched me so I went at him in one
[03:56.240 --> 04:00.720]  second he grabbed me Paul drive my head into the cement I got stitches all the
[04:00.720 --> 04:07.320]  way across the back of my head thank God that I got a head made a rock I got up
[04:07.320 --> 04:11.120]  punched him in the throat he had to go to the hospital I ran off of blood on
[04:11.120 --> 04:13.760]  my back so the police wouldn't arrest me because they see blood everywhere they
[04:13.760 --> 04:19.480]  arrest everybody and got to a clinic and got my head sewed up but the point is is
[04:19.480 --> 04:24.560]  that these little kids they don't know you did pile drive for real folks it
[04:24.560 --> 04:31.760]  didn't fun it didn't fun but again I'm having to argue that wrestling isn't
[04:31.760 --> 04:40.880]  real Obama isn't real okay it's w w f wrestling as I've said for 13 years on
[04:40.880 --> 04:45.480]  air and tears now picked up on that analogy I think he's uniquely suited to
[04:45.480 --> 04:53.600]  do it it's staged okay I'm not playing in your fantasy land got it don't you
[04:53.600 --> 05:00.040]  dare say I'm a George Bush supporter you intellectually bankrupt liars
[05:00.040 --> 05:04.360]  hello friends this is Alex Jones I've told you for a long time it's important
[05:04.360 --> 05:07.640]  to be self-sufficient and today that's more important than ever we need to be
[05:07.640 --> 05:11.200]  independent and food and water is the key you'll never have to stand in a
[05:11.200 --> 05:14.480]  bread line if you have your own bread you'll never have to go to the super
[05:14.480 --> 05:18.320]  dome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency if you
[05:18.320 --> 05:21.840]  simply prepare our elected representatives wanted a good old boy bailout
[05:21.840 --> 05:25.640]  for special interest so they ignored your screams not to do it they turned off
[05:25.640 --> 05:30.120]  the telephones and email they voted to print 850 billion dollars at least out
[05:30.120 --> 05:33.800]  of thin air this money now owns the American and European banks the
[05:33.800 --> 05:37.600]  exploding inflation that is now guaranteed will slash your life savings to
[05:37.600 --> 05:41.640]  nothing and blast the cost of assassins particularly food beyond many
[05:41.640 --> 05:45.840]  Americans reach in pre-Nazi Germany super inflation the cost of a loaf of
[05:45.840 --> 05:50.120]  bread doubled every two days until it reached over four billion marks food
[05:50.120 --> 05:53.880]  prices are skyrocketing so fast there seems as if there may be no end in
[05:53.880 --> 05:57.560]  sight the private banks merging with our government are refusing to loan
[05:57.560 --> 06:01.200]  grocery stores enough money to restock their shelves the stores have less food
[06:01.200 --> 06:05.320]  but jack of prices to stay in business whatever happens in America we need to
[06:05.320 --> 06:09.360]  be prepared and be ready everything is zeroing in on food one third of Americans
[06:09.360 --> 06:13.040]  have to choose between buying food and paying for other necessities my friends
[06:13.040 --> 06:17.400]  whatever it takes get prepared get self-sufficient get food for everybody out
[06:17.400 --> 06:20.440]  there listening it's very important for you understand that by having a supply
[06:20.440 --> 06:24.000]  of storable food the government the new old order has a lot less control over
[06:24.000 --> 06:28.440]  you and so it's a mindset a mindset of self-sufficiency and preparedness no one
[06:28.440 --> 06:32.040]  is gonna take care of your family in the final equation but you you know e-foods
[06:32.040 --> 06:35.600]  direct comm is still able to ship storeable food that's safe from E. coli
[06:35.600 --> 06:39.400]  salmonella genetic alteration or Chinese imports and they do it at almost half
[06:39.400 --> 06:45.280]  the cost of last year's grocery prices call 1-800-409-5633 or on the web go to
[06:45.280 --> 06:49.600]  e-foods direct comm visit e-foods direct comm and look over the final list of
[06:49.600 --> 06:53.640]  high-quality freeze-dried and dehydrated foods they have to offer watch the free
[06:53.640 --> 06:59.640]  videos look at their online catalog or give them a call at 1-800-409-5633 again
[06:59.640 --> 07:05.880]  800-409-5633 or on the web at e-foods direct comm take action today the first
[07:05.880 --> 07:12.960]  step is getting storeable food ease the t-rex of political talk Alex Jones on
[07:12.960 --> 07:20.080]  the GCN radio network it took us seven years to get push the
[07:20.080 --> 07:24.200]  civil writing down below 20 to get Congress down to the lowest in history
[07:24.200 --> 07:32.760]  9% approval that's a good thing because the people learn that on every policy
[07:32.760 --> 07:35.760]  the American people wanted on every issue of the Constitution liberties
[07:35.760 --> 07:43.560]  freedoms sovereign to the economy they were selling us down the river and the
[07:43.560 --> 07:47.440]  system brought in Morocco bomb to try to fool the public again just like
[07:47.440 --> 07:54.400]  George Bush was our savior from Bill Clinton and it really is sad that
[07:54.400 --> 07:58.160]  overnight all these mainline Republicans are coming on info wars.com
[07:58.160 --> 08:03.600]  prisonbunna.com they're calling me well-known prominent ones are going
[08:03.600 --> 08:10.040]  Alex good to have you back in the fold man you're right about Obama and I'm
[08:10.040 --> 08:14.080]  like I'm not in your fold you see that's what happened when I exposed Bill
[08:14.080 --> 08:20.320]  Clinton along many others it was okay because you know he's an evil commie
[08:20.320 --> 08:23.640]  no he was an evil corporate globalist selling out with Laurel and Hughes
[08:23.640 --> 08:33.080]  missile secrets to China North Korea I ran I criticized it because I am for the
[08:33.080 --> 08:37.600]  United States sovereignty and our true national security and because I do want
[08:37.600 --> 08:42.440]  true world peace and not the globalist staging conflicts worldwide the people
[08:42.440 --> 08:46.360]  that have hijacked our nation are not Americans they're globalist they hate
[08:46.360 --> 08:52.120]  this country and so I exposed Bill Clinton cut my teeth on Bill Clinton
[08:52.120 --> 08:57.680]  and I was this wonderful rising little libertarian slash you know Ron Paul
[08:57.680 --> 09:06.320]  star loved by even mainline Republicans and then they went wait a minute you're
[09:06.320 --> 09:10.560]  not for George Bush and I was like yeah he's expanding the VATF doubling and
[09:10.560 --> 09:14.200]  now tripling government going after our liberties and freedoms we know they
[09:14.200 --> 09:18.000]  stage these terror attacks I'm sorry I'm just gonna tell the facts like they
[09:18.000 --> 09:23.160]  are I don't mindlessly because I quote and affiliated with a party which I'm
[09:23.160 --> 09:28.960]  not but because I've criticized Bill Clinton I was just going to put blinders
[09:28.960 --> 09:34.120]  on and decide that reality is whatever I make it in my head you know I want the
[09:34.120 --> 09:37.520]  truth I want Veritas I want to know myself and know the world and be
[09:37.520 --> 09:41.560]  informed as best as I can be to have clear vision and understanding of the
[09:41.560 --> 09:48.080]  world and history and geopolitical movements and now after seven and three
[09:48.080 --> 09:54.280]  quarter years of George Bush suddenly right wing websites are linking to me
[09:54.280 --> 09:58.400]  suddenly another oh he's right about Obama I didn't used to like him on 9
[09:58.400 --> 10:03.040]  11 but oh man and when Obama stages terror attacks is his controllers do
[10:03.040 --> 10:07.840]  there is no doubt that a lot of these Republican sites you know the alternative
[10:07.840 --> 10:10.960]  Republican sites not the big main line ones they're gonna go yeah yeah
[10:10.960 --> 10:17.760]  absolutely look at info wars.com look at prisenplanet.com man they absolutely
[10:17.760 --> 10:26.360]  Republicans could see terrorism staged by Bill Clinton but they couldn't see it
[10:26.360 --> 10:31.840]  by George Bush because they're just puppets the same management crews over
[10:31.840 --> 10:35.000]  the intelligence agencies and the private banks that own and control them
[10:35.000 --> 10:41.800]  over the bureaucracy they are the ones running things and if Barack Obama or
[10:41.800 --> 10:46.720]  George Bush ever got out of line they would have a scandal take them down and
[10:46.720 --> 10:52.640]  if that didn't work if the media turning on them in one second under orders
[10:52.640 --> 11:03.000]  didn't work they would be assassinated assassinate period period so get it it's
[11:03.000 --> 11:08.960]  like WWF wrestling it's staged and I am just so that's why I was so mad
[11:08.960 --> 11:14.160]  yesterday I am so sick of everybody chasing their tails I am so sick of
[11:14.160 --> 11:18.720]  people getting conned and sick of them getting manipulated and the end to see
[11:18.720 --> 11:25.160]  the Democrats act just like mindless Bush supporters and suddenly all the
[11:25.160 --> 11:28.720]  tyranny of Obama I mean he's saying was gonna do more banker takeovers more
[11:28.720 --> 11:33.280]  bailouts restrictions on free speech escalation of conflicts around the
[11:33.280 --> 11:37.520]  world they're saying they're gonna keep on the Treasury secretaries and the same
[11:37.520 --> 11:43.040]  people managing the banker takeover and they're pointing all these former
[11:43.040 --> 11:49.880]  Clinton people no change more of the same and then to see you make stuff up
[11:49.880 --> 11:57.840]  about me it shows that you are now wedded in a tribal mindset of putting
[11:57.840 --> 12:00.960]  your blinders on and you're not gonna care now like what you didn't care when
[12:00.960 --> 12:04.320]  Bill Clinton blew the daylights out of Serbia killed all those people dropped
[12:04.320 --> 12:07.040]  do you all over the country blew up their infrastructure the power plants
[12:07.040 --> 12:13.360]  water plants factories for peaceful systems then staged a CIA overthrow
[12:13.360 --> 12:19.760]  there then murdered slobo in a cell and no I'm not saying slobo was a perfect
[12:19.760 --> 12:23.960]  guy governments are corrupt and bad saying the big dominant empire is this
[12:23.960 --> 12:26.680]  world banking system and they're the ones leading my country so they're the
[12:26.680 --> 12:32.920]  big enemy and if you really weigh who the most vicious premeditated people
[12:32.920 --> 12:41.360]  starting it it was the Croats and the Muslims so I've got to watch you now as
[12:41.360 --> 12:44.760]  you go around blowing third world and second world no old world countries up
[12:44.760 --> 12:48.640]  and I got a wall I just got a just sick
[12:50.400 --> 12:57.760]  you know when I was against Andre the Giant for the last eight years you know
[12:57.760 --> 13:04.480]  you your fans a Hulk Hogan so you were you were you you thought I was for you
[13:04.480 --> 13:12.760]  and now Hulk Hogan's in and you're mad at me saying oh you're against you're
[13:12.760 --> 13:18.080]  against Hulk Hogan I mean that the no I was never against Hulk Hogan and Andre
[13:18.080 --> 13:22.680]  the Giant I knew it was all fake I knew it wasn't real and we weren't gonna get
[13:22.680 --> 13:26.160]  our country back because you can have a fake wrestling match you can have the
[13:26.160 --> 13:31.120]  silliness and the stupidness of that and buy into it because that doesn't run our
[13:31.120 --> 13:37.680]  nation but when we have WWF staged events at the presidential level and
[13:37.680 --> 13:41.160]  that blocks the public offer never addressing the real shadow government
[13:41.160 --> 13:45.240]  what it's doing the unified front against the people the implosion of our
[13:45.240 --> 13:54.760]  economy and society I get very very very very very upset so I want Curt
[13:54.760 --> 14:07.360]  Emma or Paul Watson or somebody to just have the headline Alex Jones wants you
[14:07.360 --> 14:10.480]  to look past Obama to the shadow government and then explain to these
[14:10.480 --> 14:19.920]  children these children these childlike minds and these these Republicans are
[14:19.920 --> 14:24.000]  like children they don't understand I'm saying Bush is bad too now they think
[14:24.000 --> 14:28.800]  oh you don't like Obama that's great they're children it's childlike minds
[14:28.800 --> 14:36.120]  we're a lot of trouble folks we can't be children anymore coming up I want to
[14:36.120 --> 14:39.560]  play my little six and a half minute visit with Russia today on worldwide
[14:39.560 --> 14:42.800]  cable and satellite systems including areas of the United States England
[14:42.800 --> 14:47.680]  Japan you name it the Middle East Russia Eastern Europe Central Europe Central
[14:47.680 --> 14:52.480]  Asia because I really laid it out there I think good in six minutes that's gonna
[14:52.480 --> 14:56.200]  come up later that Harris isn't doing any interview she has found more
[14:56.200 --> 15:00.240]  corruption than she's ever found it in any election remember she was the
[15:00.240 --> 15:03.840]  liberal darling because she was exposing Bush stealing it she kept saying no no
[15:03.840 --> 15:11.920]  no this is bipartisan and the Democrats winning the House and Senate in 2006 made
[15:11.920 --> 15:15.200]  a lot of the movement to stop the electronic voting machine slow down it's
[15:15.200 --> 15:18.680]  still growing but not as fast and now it's sleepy time
[15:18.680 --> 15:26.240]  Obama won this system works because you know they would have cheated him if if
[15:26.240 --> 15:32.320]  if if there was fraud no if that's who they want no need to steal it but they
[15:32.320 --> 15:37.240]  stole House and Senate races and state races and it's just the evidence that
[15:37.240 --> 15:42.280]  Harris said she's basically not sleeping she's coming on for one segment she's
[15:42.280 --> 15:47.920]  not doing any other media she's gonna be on for an hour next week she said it's
[15:47.920 --> 15:56.800]  it's just it's unbelievable the election fraud and again there's no doubt that the
[15:56.800 --> 16:00.840]  popular vote did go for Obama there's no doubt grassroots polls exit polls he
[16:00.840 --> 16:07.360]  really won when we're not talking about him do you compute that do you get it
[16:07.360 --> 16:14.440]  through your fat noggin I'm talking about Obama Obama people do you
[16:14.440 --> 16:20.520]  understand that it's intellectually bankrupt to now call me a right-wing
[16:20.520 --> 16:24.320]  fascist when you were cheering me on and I kept saying you're not gonna cheer me
[16:24.320 --> 16:29.960]  when Obama gets in or Hillary gets in you're not gonna listen get ready be
[16:29.960 --> 16:33.220]  against the Patriot Act be against secret arrest and torture be against the
[16:33.220 --> 16:42.200]  wiretapping be against new wars when your Democrat gets in and now mainline
[16:42.200 --> 16:49.040]  sites Huffington Post crooks and liars raw story all of Mitch just sudden
[16:49.040 --> 16:53.480]  mindless worship and buying and brain they're out there praising crooks and
[16:53.480 --> 17:00.520]  liars is praising Fox News this is coming up to saying that Ralph Nader's
[17:00.520 --> 17:03.960]  career is over he's evil from talking about about Obama and saying he's the
[17:03.960 --> 17:08.040]  same as Bush and that basically his career is over and he's evil and I was
[17:08.040 --> 17:16.200]  watching Fox this morning again on the treadmill absolute Obama worship so now
[17:16.200 --> 17:21.360]  you got the Democrats with Fox News and I told you that Fox News in memos two
[17:21.360 --> 17:28.200]  years ago that went public they're saying get ready to switch Democrat and see

[25:35.840 --> 25:41.640]  minute clip of shepherd Smith on Fox News you can call it that trying to set up
[25:41.640 --> 25:47.480]  and misconstrue an attack and claim that Ralph Nader is a racist and on the
[25:47.480 --> 25:52.560]  liberal blogs I checked a couple of this morning they are hailing you can go
[25:52.560 --> 25:58.320]  read them at course in large other places we have links to it in the story
[25:58.320 --> 26:03.960]  about it they are hailing Fox News saying that's right Ralph Nader is an
[26:03.960 --> 26:10.440]  evil racist Ralph Nader doesn't like black people I mean it just there's no
[26:10.440 --> 26:23.000]  end there's no end there's no end let me give you the bottom line on that he
[26:23.000 --> 26:28.640]  said on a radio interview on election night after he'd been elected at Tuesday
[26:28.640 --> 26:33.600]  night he said they played the clip he said Obama is controlled by the very
[26:33.600 --> 26:36.480]  same corporate interests that control George Bush his policies are basically
[26:36.480 --> 26:39.800]  the same he listed some of them and he said I challenge him though it's great
[26:39.800 --> 26:42.360]  that's an African-American it's great that we made that stride that's the only
[26:42.360 --> 26:48.680]  good thing I see in this and I hope that he will be an Uncle Sam and not an
[26:48.680 --> 26:54.800]  Uncle Tom you know Uncle Tom's cabin was a book written about blacks going
[26:54.800 --> 26:59.920]  along with the system to suppress other blacks and poor people that's a term
[26:59.920 --> 27:06.240]  that blacks use that's their term and so he was pointing that out and of course
[27:06.240 --> 27:11.200]  he didn't apologize for it that's the child likeness that's the child likeness
[27:11.200 --> 27:14.920]  of the public in Fox who you know said everything in the book about Obama a lot
[27:14.920 --> 27:20.960]  of it not true the race baiting all of it in applying he's some terrorist he's
[27:20.960 --> 27:26.320]  not a he's not a radical terrorist he's a foundation establishment guy but they
[27:26.320 --> 27:30.680]  they framed him as the revolutionary you know from the people as if that was a
[27:30.680 --> 27:36.520]  bad thing when he's really a revolutionary for the bankers a front man and so they
[27:36.520 --> 27:41.400]  are just hyping this is a his career is over it's over he's bad that's the end
[27:41.400 --> 27:46.680]  of it for pointing out that he needs to be a leader but I guarantee folks he's
[27:46.680 --> 27:50.120]  already announcing what he's gonna do before the election and now after I've
[27:50.120 --> 27:56.200]  got a bunch of mainline articles where they're hailing his policies and it's a
[27:56.200 --> 28:01.680]  total banker bailout takeover with nothing for the people of the economy and
[28:01.680 --> 28:07.200]  I'm again I'm not a leftist socialist so I'm but if we're gonna devalue the
[28:07.200 --> 28:12.280]  dollar might as well bail out Ford and GM and people's jobs you might as well
[28:12.280 --> 28:15.480]  reduce people's mortgages if the government's gonna go in there and make
[28:15.480 --> 28:20.560]  good and pay these banks for them why not then forgive that portion and reduce
[28:20.560 --> 28:24.080]  the price of the house I mean if you're gonna do that if you're gonna kill the
[28:24.080 --> 28:27.280]  dollar you might as well do something for the economy that'll make it a lot
[28:27.280 --> 28:30.280]  better crash landing than the going straight into the ground we're gonna
[28:30.280 --> 28:36.960]  have under this but see the transfer of the wealth crowd that thinks Obama's
[28:36.960 --> 28:45.280]  gonna give him something no he says you get nothing nothing that's why he's
[28:45.280 --> 28:48.000]  being held by the international banks go ahead and give Bev Harris on the line
[28:48.000 --> 28:50.960]  right now we've got her coming up with what really happened with the election
[28:50.960 --> 28:54.320]  fraud but I'll forget about that now Obama's elected let's ignore the electronic

[33:57.280 --> 34:01.040]  shocking she was deaf and they immediately told her she
[34:01.040 --> 34:04.720]  she couldn't understand them they made mo they made no um
[34:04.720 --> 34:07.840]  accommodation for that they just hand her something and tell her to re-register
[34:07.840 --> 34:10.800]  which would have meant she could have voted in the next election but not this
[34:10.800 --> 34:14.800]  one and uh i stood up for her and said wait a minute what the heck are you
[34:14.800 --> 34:18.720]  doing and indeed they found her name it was right there on the page right in
[34:18.720 --> 34:23.280]  front of their face i think this happened to millions of voters
[34:23.280 --> 34:26.960]  this year it was just unprecedented how many people they just
[34:26.960 --> 34:31.040]  oops can't find you oops and then if you assert yourself
[34:31.040 --> 34:35.440]  assert yourself really hard you would get found
[34:35.440 --> 34:40.400]  this is a problem i'm not sure what the solution is but this is a real problem
[34:40.400 --> 34:44.240]  but yeah the same kinds of things that we've always seen are not one thing
[34:44.240 --> 34:49.360]  has changed since monday you know a lot of people got the president that they
[34:49.360 --> 34:54.240]  wanted and uh i think that it was clear because of
[34:54.240 --> 34:58.800]  the mobilization of voters and so forth that there was going to be
[34:58.800 --> 35:03.520]  likely to be a landslide it's very dangerous to tamper against the landslide
[35:03.520 --> 35:07.520]  but there were a whole lot of other things on those ballots and these gambling
[35:07.520 --> 35:12.000]  initiatives and the closed races uh again it's crazy the stuff that we're
[35:12.000 --> 35:15.440]  seeing just as an example in oregon portland
[35:15.440 --> 35:19.840]  multnomah county they claimed that 150,000 ballots got wet now there's a
[35:19.840 --> 35:24.400]  very close race there going on and they couldn't come up with the
[35:24.400 --> 35:27.280]  results and they said oh the ballots got wet
[35:27.280 --> 35:33.440]  well okay show me the water you know and uh just you know the typical
[35:33.440 --> 35:37.600]  things the vote flipping the machines that um they found in michigan that the
[35:37.600 --> 35:41.360]  machines were about four percent off in other words every time you ran the
[35:41.360 --> 35:44.320]  ballots through them they gave a different response and they were
[35:44.320 --> 35:47.920]  inaccurate to this to this to the extent of four percent
[35:47.920 --> 35:52.880]  i mean even in austin i heard reports of machines not working things broken down
[35:52.880 --> 35:57.360]  and of course not working as is is you know indicative of the flipping so it's
[35:57.360 --> 36:00.560]  just all over the place oh and in the state of kentucky
[36:00.560 --> 36:04.160]  they pulled all the heart eastlake machines which is what you have in
[36:04.160 --> 36:08.800]  travis county they pulled all the eastlake machines at night because
[36:08.800 --> 36:12.960]  there was a problem they were misreading the straight county votes
[36:12.960 --> 36:16.320]  so and we got that from a poll worker it made the news
[36:16.320 --> 36:22.560]  um it just issues just all over the place and i have to say if i
[36:22.560 --> 36:26.880]  you know in 2009 i want to be focusing on solutions
[36:26.880 --> 36:31.760]  and i think the number one solution has got to be compliance with even the
[36:31.760 --> 36:34.960]  existing laws i mean what what we have that is
[36:34.960 --> 36:39.760]  existing laws and existing safeguards is not nearly enough
[36:39.760 --> 36:44.720]  but they don't even comply with those so you know if they're not going to follow
[36:44.720 --> 36:48.160]  the law and if when you prove to an authority like the
[36:48.160 --> 36:51.840]  secretary of state or the attorney general that the laws were violated
[36:51.840 --> 36:54.800]  they do nothing there are no consequences
[36:54.800 --> 36:58.640]  then it doesn't matter what new procedures or laws we put in place
[36:58.640 --> 37:02.320]  they won't be followed so i think the first thing we really need to be
[37:02.320 --> 37:05.440]  tackling is say look i don't want to hear oops
[37:05.440 --> 37:09.200]  i don't want to hear oh you know we'll give them a free pass this time
[37:09.200 --> 37:13.040]  some of these guys have had a free pass for two three elections in a row put them
[37:13.040 --> 37:16.080]  in jail you know that'll send a message that they
[37:16.080 --> 37:18.640]  need to be following their own checks and balances
[37:18.640 --> 37:22.400]  these election officials by the way in many of the larger counties
[37:22.400 --> 37:25.360]  are making a hundred and fifty thousand dollars a year
[37:25.360 --> 37:29.520]  so it's not like the salaries too low to get a good manager
[37:29.520 --> 37:33.040]  they're just not managing they're not following the law well then let's be
[37:33.040 --> 37:35.760]  clear here what were these five big companies
[37:35.760 --> 37:40.080]  we can argue four big electronic companies
[37:40.080 --> 37:42.960]  whether it's paperless or not that's going through computers
[37:42.960 --> 37:46.080]  and it's designed for fraud they've caught them hacking they've caught them
[37:46.080 --> 37:49.600]  flipping literally thousands of times engineers have gone public saying i was
[37:49.600 --> 37:53.520]  hired to engage in fraud programmers for major companies testify
[37:53.520 --> 37:57.200]  it never hits national news other than your documentary that you're in
[37:57.200 --> 38:01.760]  hacking democracy so bottom line we know this is a fraudulent
[38:01.760 --> 38:05.600]  uh broken system on the good side fraudulent the bad side
[38:05.600 --> 38:10.240]  and so now with a lot of the left upset seeing two elections clearly stolen
[38:10.240 --> 38:12.880]  and again i said both of them were puppets but i mean i'm nonpartisan but
[38:12.880 --> 38:16.640]  clearly you know al gore and uh... you know kerry had them stolen and they
[38:16.640 --> 38:19.360]  laid down to it i mean clearly now this you know the big
[38:19.360 --> 38:24.400]  issue here is the fraud continues and everybody kind of goes back to sleep
[38:24.400 --> 38:28.160]  i'm i'm not so sure they will you know what is it
[38:28.160 --> 38:32.720]  what is good that i'm seeing is most of the people i'm in community with and
[38:32.720 --> 38:36.160]  certainly the people in the election integrity community totally get that
[38:36.160 --> 38:40.160]  nothing has changed that you can't solve the problem by putting a
[38:40.160 --> 38:43.440]  different candidate in office from a different political party
[38:43.440 --> 38:47.120]  you still have to get the public back in control of the system
[38:47.120 --> 38:50.400]  you know as long as you've got both being counted in secret
[38:50.400 --> 38:54.720]  controlled by insiders the system has not been solved and
[38:54.720 --> 38:58.480]  by the way i you know the officials keep saying well you know you can trust the
[38:58.480 --> 39:02.800]  machines because we have safeguards well what i'm saying is
[39:02.800 --> 39:05.760]  they're not even following the law on their own yeah they're not even
[39:05.760 --> 39:09.200]  following the whitewash rules they've got explain that yeah yeah exactly i mean
[39:09.200 --> 39:13.360]  let me here's a great example we told everyone to go out and videotape the
[39:13.360 --> 39:16.480]  poll tape which is the result that's closest to the source before it goes
[39:16.480 --> 39:19.360]  through Benjamin a middleman it's supposed to be hung on the polling
[39:19.360 --> 39:23.040]  place guy from tipton county tennessee goes he does that i love these citizens
[39:23.040 --> 39:25.280]  who just get out there and make it happen right
[39:25.280 --> 39:28.720]  they tell him well yeah the law says we have to post it
[39:28.720 --> 39:31.840]  but it doesn't have to we don't have to it doesn't say we have to post it where
[39:31.840 --> 39:35.840]  anyone can see it so they posted it in a locked room
[39:35.840 --> 39:39.040]  but obviously the law is clear it needs to be publicly you know
[39:39.040 --> 39:42.960]  you know it this is the kind of thing i'm seeing
[39:42.960 --> 39:47.840]  over and over and over just out and out of obstruction williamson county texas
[39:47.840 --> 39:52.400]  only three places out of the whole county posted their poll tapes
[39:52.400 --> 39:56.720]  you know they're not following the safeguards that are in place well here's
[39:56.720 --> 39:59.760]  an example in hacking democracy and again there's thousands of these folks
[39:59.760 --> 40:02.960]  i mean there's so much you can't even go over all the evidence
[40:02.960 --> 40:07.840]  in hacking democracy you show up uh what it was in florida in one case
[40:07.840 --> 40:11.440]  right and you go in and you say okay i want to see the poll tape and they give
[40:11.440 --> 40:15.360]  you a newly printed out one and then you go you know what
[40:15.360 --> 40:20.320]  i want to go see under state law the the the original night
[40:20.320 --> 40:23.440]  and you show up and it's completely opposite votes
[40:23.440 --> 40:26.560]  and they're throwing them in the trash getting a phone call as you show up
[40:26.560 --> 40:29.760]  you physically fight with them to grab it away it rips open
[40:29.760 --> 40:32.640]  you grab the poll tapes illegally being thrown away they're supposed to keep
[40:32.640 --> 40:36.640]  for years and there it is clear fraud right i mean i mean you catch the
[40:36.640 --> 40:39.920]  yeah and then you catch the cat with the canary in its mouth
[40:39.920 --> 40:43.200]  exactly and and when you see this kind of stuff
[40:43.200 --> 40:47.360]  and you get absolute proof and you take it to the secretary of state you take it
[40:47.360 --> 40:49.520]  to the attorney general you take it to court
[40:49.520 --> 40:53.280]  they refuse to consequent this stuff or look at it
[40:53.280 --> 40:57.600]  it's like well the rule of politics is you know 11 days after the election it
[40:57.600 --> 41:00.800]  goes away and you know if you did that with a bank
[41:00.800 --> 41:03.600]  robbery do is what they have to do they keep saying well let's let's be
[41:03.600 --> 41:07.520]  forward thinking and solve it for the next time no no if somebody
[41:07.520 --> 41:11.200]  that's my control that's you know yeah yeah if somebody robbed the bank do
[41:11.200 --> 41:14.560]  you say let's be forward thinking and just put up a better
[41:14.560 --> 41:17.840]  vault lock no you go after the person who did it
[41:17.840 --> 41:21.920]  we've got to go for consequences we've got to insist that every single one of
[41:21.920 --> 41:25.040]  these safeguards be followed we have a video on
[41:25.040 --> 41:28.320]  central count and absentee procedures up where
[41:28.320 --> 41:32.000]  you know these these seals that they put on they go look we're sealing
[41:32.000 --> 41:34.800]  everything for chain of custody that's got a little number
[41:34.800 --> 41:37.680]  well what they don't mention is they're giving people extra seals and the
[41:37.680 --> 41:40.400]  numbers don't match when they finally show up where the seals are missing
[41:40.400 --> 41:43.440]  when they show up what does it tell you if you get an envelope that's supposed
[41:43.440 --> 41:46.560]  to have cash in it ballots are basically cash as far as
[41:46.560 --> 41:49.920]  security and the envelope's been ripped open
[41:49.920 --> 41:53.600]  i mean you don't trust that all the cash is still there
[41:53.600 --> 41:59.680]  you know so we really have got to stop making excuses well there's also in
[41:59.680 --> 42:02.400]  close races as you've caught them over and over again and we've caught them
[42:02.400 --> 42:06.160]  they'll load vans up with them drive down side roads you got to chase them
[42:06.160 --> 42:10.480]  yeah yeah and and and when the ballot boxes are put on sealed when they pull
[42:10.480 --> 42:13.920]  up after disappearing for hours they're all busted open and the people are all
[42:13.920 --> 42:17.680]  slinking yeah yeah and and and then they say well
[42:17.680 --> 42:22.240]  let's just move on you know and in your conspiracy theories and it's like in
[42:22.240 --> 42:26.720]  the real world really if we had elections procedures
[42:26.720 --> 42:31.600]  the same way we act in the real world which is hey if you are a bartender you
[42:31.600 --> 42:35.600]  can't just not account for your cash you know i just had a
[42:35.600 --> 42:38.480]  three counties in ohio they didn't get their their
[42:38.480 --> 42:41.600]  their numbers in and somebody says oh well they probably couldn't get them in
[42:41.600 --> 42:47.200]  on time i'm like come on you know you can't do that my church
[42:47.200 --> 42:50.560]  they have to get you know they're supposed to get the donation to deposit
[42:50.560 --> 42:53.920]  in the bank a certain within a certain number of hours after church closes they
[42:53.920 --> 42:58.000]  don't get to just say oh you know what we just didn't do it for two weeks
[42:58.000 --> 43:02.960]  you know that doesn't go over so i don't understand how these high paid
[43:02.960 --> 43:06.160]  election officials and i'm talking about the big counties where they're paid
[43:06.160 --> 43:09.040]  you know they're in those upper tax brackets getting close and one of them
[43:09.040 --> 43:11.600]  was being paid three hundred thousand dollars
[43:11.600 --> 43:15.360]  you know these people cannot do the simple function of getting their number
[43:15.360 --> 43:18.240]  they're paid well to steal the elections they're paid well to do it they're told
[43:18.240 --> 43:21.600]  by the by the shadow government now now now now there's we've only got about
[43:21.600 --> 43:25.120]  five minutes left for you you want to talk to you this morning you just said
[43:25.120 --> 43:27.520]  that it's overwhelming the reports and you're just
[43:27.520 --> 43:30.800]  you know nailed down right now focusing on those and next week you're going to
[43:30.800 --> 43:34.240]  come in probably wednesday or thursday to give us more details because hindsight
[43:34.240 --> 43:37.440]  always gives you time to go through all these reports but run through some more
[43:37.440 --> 43:42.880]  of what you're seeing come in well uh example i mean just the oops excuse
[43:42.880 --> 43:46.080]  is probably a thing that gets my goat now it's like the election officials have
[43:46.080 --> 43:49.200]  learned that people are sort of watching so their new thing is to just do
[43:49.200 --> 43:52.640]  whatever they want and not follow the law and so i can go rob a bank and then
[43:52.640 --> 43:57.200]  walk out with a cash and and again real world
[43:57.200 --> 44:00.240]  ignorance of the law failure to follow the law and saying oops
[44:00.240 --> 44:03.680]  doesn't work but for some reason because this is all political
[44:03.680 --> 44:06.400]  it's a government people want to be friends with them and they want them to
[44:06.400 --> 44:10.400]  like him and they think that they and they accept these oops as far as i'm
[44:10.400 --> 44:13.680]  concerned i don't care i don't care if it was a mistake
[44:13.680 --> 44:17.520]  you didn't do your job and as far as i'm concerned since
[44:17.520 --> 44:21.440]  if the job was a safeguard we have no basis for confidence that the numbers
[44:21.440 --> 44:24.880]  were correct if you didn't do your job and you didn't do the safeguards we might
[44:24.880 --> 44:27.680]  as well assume your numbers are dittled
[44:27.680 --> 44:31.840]  that's how it works in the real world and then you magically
[44:31.840 --> 44:35.920]  as a corporate fraud investigator to match your job
[44:35.920 --> 44:39.120]  you magically where you see smoke you go look there's fire
[44:39.120 --> 44:43.680]  well oh yeah i mean there's so much at stake with these things it makes
[44:43.680 --> 44:47.520]  in no kind of sense the public has become far too trusting
[44:47.520 --> 44:51.520]  uh... more examples there's a fellow who want to watch the absentee vote counting
[44:51.520 --> 44:55.440]  in it out oregon he was told you know you can't videotape anything because you
[44:55.440 --> 44:58.640]  might videotape social security numbers and i'm thinking well if you're leaving
[44:58.640 --> 45:01.840]  social security numbers out on a table you have a management problem
[45:01.840 --> 45:04.880]  then he goes in and they said you know if you're taking notes you're being
[45:04.880 --> 45:07.200]  disruptive so they kicked him out
[45:07.200 --> 45:11.440]  i mean the hiding of information is another area
[45:11.440 --> 45:14.880]  not following the law not following required procedures
[45:14.880 --> 45:19.360]  and hiding information they're openly breaking law of things we'd start to
[45:19.360 --> 45:22.480]  get some traction they're openly breaking the law to hide
[45:22.480 --> 45:25.600]  that's it they're guilty exactly put them in jail
[45:25.600 --> 45:30.320]  i mean people are shocked when i say that but i'm like
[45:30.320 --> 45:35.360]  i'm sorry this is our election you know obama made a reference to touchscreens
[45:35.360 --> 45:39.440]  in his acceptance speech and i kind of you know called that one out and said
[45:39.440 --> 45:42.400]  look that's not cool well that's neuro linguistic
[45:42.400 --> 45:45.840]  programming and all the speeches he said when you touch that screen and he goes
[45:45.840 --> 45:49.360]  to the motion right and so it's you touched you touched me it's like a
[45:49.360 --> 45:53.200]  TV breacher touch your television screen here's the thing
[45:53.200 --> 45:56.160]  no matter who you like for president or don't like
[45:56.160 --> 46:01.280]  he doesn't own it we do we're the public we own the system so i don't even care
[46:01.280 --> 46:05.040]  if he likes touchscreens we own it we aren't having it we're going to get
[46:05.040 --> 46:08.080]  rid of this that's him pushing the agenda he means he's got a job when we all
[46:08.080 --> 46:11.360]  know that but yeah that wasn't an accident that that was in the speech
[46:11.360 --> 46:16.480]  and um it it i have to say you know antennas went up right away
[46:16.480 --> 46:19.920]  it's all brainwashing oh he's slick man he's following the total corporate
[46:19.920 --> 46:22.880]  agenda and no we're not for george bush folks are john mckay
[46:22.880 --> 46:26.400]  the whole point is here we're in trouble well bev i mean where does it go from
[46:26.400 --> 46:30.960]  here now that you know ten years ago what five six
[46:30.960 --> 46:34.160]  percent polls or ten percent polls knew that was election fraud
[46:34.160 --> 46:38.240]  now it's ninety some percent yeah it's getting there so so so i mean what
[46:38.240 --> 46:40.400]  happens i mean how does this
[46:40.400 --> 46:44.640]  still making a difference just you know there was a lot of deterrence there was
[46:44.640 --> 46:47.680]  a lot of stuff that didn't happen because there were so many citizens out
[46:47.680 --> 46:51.360]  there just blanketing the place and it became very dangerous
[46:51.360 --> 46:55.440]  uh it is amazing what even one person can do one citizen who was brand new at
[46:55.440 --> 46:59.200]  this asked one question in massachusetts and got the wrong answer
[46:59.200 --> 47:02.800]  and uh then she asked the call the secretary state
[47:02.800 --> 47:07.440]  ended up uh you know publicizing yet the entire state of massachusetts
[47:07.440 --> 47:12.480]  issued an emergency bulletin it to stop so uh a fairly bad procedure that was
[47:12.480 --> 47:16.160]  going on and then that's spread out across the other states in new england
[47:16.160 --> 47:21.440]  look one it we it is our system we we've got to make sure we understand
[47:21.440 --> 47:25.520]  this is not something that the election officials own the legislature doesn't
[47:25.520 --> 47:30.000]  own it we own it and so if we don't like what we're
[47:30.000 --> 47:34.000]  seeing we have to take control by being out there
[47:34.000 --> 47:38.160]  paying attention asking questions exposing stuff
[47:38.160 --> 47:42.320]  and i think the next step in terms of problems before we even get to
[47:42.320 --> 47:46.400]  new laws and new systems and so forth has to be compliance with the law
[47:46.400 --> 47:50.560]  and get it so that they cannot hide stuff from us
[47:50.560 --> 47:54.800]  yeah they can hide things is you know you're not
[47:54.800 --> 47:58.320]  free it's not liberty if they hide the results from you
[47:58.320 --> 48:01.600]  folks can learn more at blackboxvoting.org you know i
[48:01.600 --> 48:05.360]  i want to bring up two final points and i want you to comment on one of them
[48:05.360 --> 48:09.760]  is that we saw the imperial hubris bush saying i'm above the law nixon said
[48:09.760 --> 48:12.960]  it's not illegal when the president does it we see that now from election
[48:12.960 --> 48:16.960]  officials where they say we don't have to follow the law whereas in real
[48:16.960 --> 48:20.160]  whereas in real jurisprudence government people are supposed to be at a
[48:20.160 --> 48:24.000]  higher center that said you criticized obama brainwashing people
[48:24.000 --> 48:26.960]  you're now going to be called anti-black in a racist i just want to point out
[48:26.960 --> 48:32.000]  you know i was like i'll tell your your your your folks that i voted for obama
[48:32.000 --> 48:36.400]  i actually support obama however uh i don't care

[48:39.760 --> 48:43.120]  many years of the family to a black man so but i mean it doesn't matter though
[48:43.120 --> 48:47.040]  you said a little something bad so bad you know kind of the yeah it doesn't
[48:47.040 --> 48:51.120]  it's this stuff we we have to get past hero worship
[48:51.120 --> 48:56.400]  you have to get past being the children of the fathers you know no no no no
[48:56.400 --> 49:00.560]  our officials are our employees not the other way around
[49:00.560 --> 49:03.840]  yes and once we get that through our heads that we are sovereign
[49:03.840 --> 49:10.000]  then um actually you can feel a lot more a little more calm to know hey it

[1:01:28.160 --> 1:01:34.160]  because you and i both um i have my own self have been preaching and
[1:01:34.160 --> 1:01:38.560]  teaching and telling each and every individual i've ever met
[1:01:38.560 --> 1:01:46.960]  for the last 15 years now mind you i'm 41 i knew when i was 19
[1:01:46.960 --> 1:01:53.520]  when my mother said well chris be an attorney
[1:01:53.520 --> 1:01:59.360]  and i said mom you understand that being an attorney is just to
[1:01:59.360 --> 1:02:03.440]  fight under their law they write the law
[1:02:03.440 --> 1:02:09.200]  how can you fight when the individuals you're fighting against
[1:02:09.200 --> 1:02:18.560]  write the rules well alex you have done everything that anyone can do
[1:02:18.560 --> 1:02:23.280]  and guess what you and i both have been doing the same thing
[1:02:23.280 --> 1:02:29.360]  we keep talking to individuals that don't want to listen
[1:02:29.360 --> 1:02:36.080]  however today is the day and we know and you and i both know
[1:02:36.080 --> 1:02:42.880]  that we have a small gathering a small gathering of at least
[1:02:42.880 --> 1:02:47.680]  i bet at least two or three million if not 10 million
[1:02:47.680 --> 1:02:50.560]  around the planet oh it's a lot more than that
[1:02:50.560 --> 1:02:57.440]  amen and the power of our spoken word now mind you
[1:02:57.440 --> 1:03:02.320]  you and i both know what we really want to do
[1:03:02.320 --> 1:03:06.720]  but we can't do it and so therefore
[1:03:06.720 --> 1:03:10.400]  instead of pulling out what should be pulled out
[1:03:10.400 --> 1:03:15.440]  we need to pull out our mouth well the good news is and i appreciate your
[1:03:15.440 --> 1:03:18.000]  calls sir and take up the calls quicker today
[1:03:18.000 --> 1:03:24.720]  the good news is the people are waking up exponentially
[1:03:24.720 --> 1:03:29.280]  monday night tuesday night they were saying projected 87 turn out
[1:03:29.280 --> 1:03:32.960]  and then it was some subgroups of the population you did have close to 80
[1:03:32.960 --> 1:03:36.080]  percent turnout uh the total turnout was only
[1:03:36.080 --> 1:03:39.520]  about 64 percent you can go pull these numbers up
[1:03:39.520 --> 1:03:47.840]  this google voter turnout 2008 so obama only got about what 37 38 percent of
[1:03:47.840 --> 1:03:50.400]  the vote mccain like 32 percent or something
[1:03:50.400 --> 1:03:55.840]  so and most those people know that they're just hoping for change so
[1:03:55.840 --> 1:03:59.680]  uh again that 9 percent approval rating for congress that's really the proof
[1:03:59.680 --> 1:04:03.600]  there that people know stuff is rotten in the state of denmark
[1:04:03.600 --> 1:04:08.560]  so uh people aren't suckered we'll be right back when more calls
[1:04:08.560 --> 1:04:12.240]  hello friends this is alex jones i've told you for a long time it's important
[1:04:12.240 --> 1:04:15.040]  to be self-sufficient and today that's more important than ever
[1:04:15.040 --> 1:04:18.640]  we need to be independent and food and water is the key you'll never have to
[1:04:18.640 --> 1:04:21.920]  stand in the bread line if you have your own bread you'll never have to go to
[1:04:21.920 --> 1:04:24.400]  the superdome and beg for femur to take care of your
[1:04:24.400 --> 1:04:27.680]  family in any emergency if you simply prepare our elected
[1:04:27.680 --> 1:04:31.200]  representatives wanted a good old boy bailout for a special interest so they
[1:04:31.200 --> 1:04:34.800]  ignored your screams not to do it they turned off the telephones and email
[1:04:34.800 --> 1:04:38.720]  they voted to print 850 billion dollars at least out of thin air
[1:04:38.720 --> 1:04:42.800]  this money now owns the american and european banks the exploding inflation
[1:04:42.800 --> 1:04:46.080]  that is now guaranteed will slash your life savings to nothing and
[1:04:46.080 --> 1:04:49.600]  blast the cost of necessities particularly food beyond many
[1:04:49.600 --> 1:04:52.800]  americans reach in pre-nazi germany super inflation
[1:04:52.800 --> 1:04:56.640]  the cost of a loaf of bread doubled every two days until it reached over four
[1:04:56.640 --> 1:04:59.600]  billion marks food prices are skyrocketing so
[1:04:59.600 --> 1:05:02.240]  fast there seems as if there may be no end in sight
[1:05:02.240 --> 1:05:05.600]  the private banks merging with our government are refusing to loan
[1:05:05.600 --> 1:05:07.920]  grocery stores enough money to restock their shelves
[1:05:07.920 --> 1:05:11.200]  the stores have less food but jack up prices to stay in business
[1:05:11.200 --> 1:05:14.560]  whatever happens in america we need to be prepared and be ready
[1:05:14.560 --> 1:05:18.160]  everything is zeroing in on food one third of americans have to choose between
[1:05:18.160 --> 1:05:20.400]  buying food and paying for other necessities
[1:05:20.400 --> 1:05:23.840]  my friends whatever it takes get prepared get self-sufficient
[1:05:23.840 --> 1:05:26.880]  get food for everybody out there listening it's very important for you
[1:05:26.880 --> 1:05:29.280]  understand that by having a supply of storable food
[1:05:29.280 --> 1:05:32.640]  the government the new old order has a lot less control over you and so it's a
[1:05:32.640 --> 1:05:36.000]  mindset a mindset of self-sufficiency and preparedness
[1:05:36.000 --> 1:05:39.200]  no one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you

[1:07:19.120 --> 1:07:23.600]  youtube and other videos out there of uh... you being a uh...
[1:07:23.600 --> 1:07:28.800]  reptilian shape shifter and it shows your eyes with that cat-like slant
[1:07:28.800 --> 1:07:31.840]  do you know what happened to them and where they're at you know because
[1:07:31.840 --> 1:07:35.120]  all of a sudden they're they're not on there no more
[1:07:35.120 --> 1:07:39.760]  and personally i think your government-controlled piece of trash
[1:07:39.760 --> 1:07:42.880]  is that a is this a joke no this ain't a joke
[1:07:42.880 --> 1:07:45.920]  i know exactly who you are and what you are
[1:07:45.920 --> 1:07:49.920]  and your trash all you are is a blowhard
[1:07:49.920 --> 1:07:54.160]  and all you do is promote fear and propaganda
[1:07:54.160 --> 1:07:58.000]  you go on far to see and then you get caught and held by the
[1:07:58.000 --> 1:08:01.440]  uh... bill deberg and all this other crap
[1:08:01.440 --> 1:08:05.920]  you get access to all the both of them on hold sir you're getting into the edge
[1:08:05.920 --> 1:08:11.280]  of uh... some rough language there you are welcome to talk about about me
[1:08:11.280 --> 1:08:15.520]  right now but let's just try to be congenial here so and i need to try to
[1:08:15.520 --> 1:08:20.320]  be congenial too i can get angry too um number one
[1:08:20.320 --> 1:08:23.360]  i've only been on seeing it a few times and they tried to ask me back and then
[1:08:23.360 --> 1:08:26.960]  they've been told by their higher ups i told the story this was a jay
[1:08:26.960 --> 1:08:30.320]  hammers uh producer told me that the higher ups above
[1:08:30.320 --> 1:08:32.880]  programming called and said no more on which comes
[1:08:32.880 --> 1:08:38.240]  and that's on record going back to 2006 uh... i have been attacked by cnn
[1:08:38.240 --> 1:08:41.280]  i've been attacked by the history channel viciously
[1:08:41.280 --> 1:08:45.040]  uh... but uh... i do get on some foreign tv
[1:08:45.040 --> 1:08:49.040]  and that's a good thing but generally let's say i'll go on bbc radio
[1:08:49.040 --> 1:08:54.000]  it'll be five to one but get the host is against me with three or four guests
[1:08:54.000 --> 1:08:59.120]  attacking me uh... so uh...
[1:08:59.120 --> 1:09:06.560]  number one i've laughed about those and even talked about them on air
[1:09:06.560 --> 1:09:10.240]  what happened
[1:09:10.240 --> 1:09:15.360]  that's where my fee was just coming up whenever i
[1:09:15.360 --> 1:09:19.600]  am here in the studio and there's two lights shining on me in front of me
[1:09:19.600 --> 1:09:23.520]  on the ceiling not that we like things very well
[1:09:23.520 --> 1:09:29.200]  doing better at the new studio we're building i will look up
[1:09:29.200 --> 1:09:34.720]  to the ceiling and there are two lights there
[1:09:34.720 --> 1:09:39.120]  and so what that does is if you blow those videos up or photos up
[1:09:39.120 --> 1:09:42.160]  of anybody in a studio where there's the two-point lighting in the front and one
[1:09:42.160 --> 1:09:45.600]  in the back so it's three-point lighting you can go take rtf you learn about it
[1:09:45.600 --> 1:09:49.440]  it's real basic or even online they have on youtube
[1:09:49.440 --> 1:09:52.960]  instead of free lighting classes i should probably take one or two but the
[1:09:52.960 --> 1:09:56.560]  point is to refresh myself
[1:09:56.560 --> 1:10:01.440]  my memory um you will have
[1:10:01.440 --> 1:10:09.040]  two lights shining you know it has a reflection on your eyes
[1:10:09.040 --> 1:10:13.280]  and you know i really can't even respond to all of this
[1:10:13.280 --> 1:10:16.800]  um i'm a kgb agent i'm a scientologist i'm a vatican
[1:10:16.800 --> 1:10:23.120]  assassin i'm a zionist agent uh what else is there i'm a
[1:10:23.120 --> 1:10:28.960]  transvestite um let me think of the other ones
[1:10:28.960 --> 1:10:33.520]  i'm a neanderthal i'm not joking about that uh that you know they say that i
[1:10:33.520 --> 1:10:37.520]  say that and it's just silliness sir it's silliness
[1:10:37.520 --> 1:10:40.800]  and it's all part of mass mental illness and i have
[1:10:40.800 --> 1:10:44.960]  hey i'm not aware that videos on the web that have been taken down of me supposedly
[1:10:44.960 --> 1:10:48.800]  turning into shape shifter but i guess that's the proof of it i mean
[1:10:48.800 --> 1:10:52.640]  that you know there you have it uh but if i am a shape shifter aren't i a good
[1:10:52.640 --> 1:10:56.640]  shape shifter i mean i'm here exposing all of this stuff
[1:10:56.640 --> 1:11:00.240]  um now i want to go on to some serious calls
[1:11:00.240 --> 1:11:04.800]  uh kevin but i'm gonna let you have a minute or so to finish up
[1:11:04.800 --> 1:11:10.160]  he dropped off um you know i told you they were preparing for
[1:11:10.160 --> 1:11:13.680]  marshal law and to use the army in america i told you that a decade ago
[1:11:13.680 --> 1:11:17.040]  and it's it's happening now i told you they'd built fema camps it's now in
[1:11:17.040 --> 1:11:19.680]  major newspapers i told you they were secretly hiring
[1:11:19.680 --> 1:11:23.440]  preachers and training them to give sermons to their flock
[1:11:23.440 --> 1:11:27.600]  to prepare them to submit to marshal law it's now mainstream news
[1:11:27.600 --> 1:11:31.520]  uh i told you that they would implode the subprime mortgages and the derivatives
[1:11:31.520 --> 1:11:34.720]  to have a vertical integration of the world banking system
[1:11:34.720 --> 1:11:37.760]  and that has now happened and they're announcing a world government run
[1:11:37.760 --> 1:11:41.440]  foreign by the banks with carbon taxes and toben taxes paid to a select
[1:11:41.440 --> 1:11:44.640]  intergroup of banks controlling all the other banks and insurance companies
[1:11:44.640 --> 1:11:50.480]  and stock markets of the world okay it's now all happening all over the news
[1:11:50.480 --> 1:11:54.400]  now the we've been right about thousands of other things why
[1:11:54.400 --> 1:11:57.440]  we read the club of rome we read the council on foreign relations we read
[1:11:57.440 --> 1:12:00.800]  government documents ran corporation british ministry of defense
[1:12:00.800 --> 1:12:04.560]  a federation of american scientists in my tea documents
[1:12:04.560 --> 1:12:08.240]  i've traveled universities and libraries i've interviewed top scientists in
[1:12:08.240 --> 1:12:12.400]  every field of nanotech genetic engineering uh robotics
[1:12:12.400 --> 1:12:17.280]  cybernetics i've i've interviewed all all the major heads of life extension
[1:12:17.280 --> 1:12:21.120]  uh and the transhuman movement and the post human movement
[1:12:21.120 --> 1:12:28.400]  i immersed myself i immersed myself in research and study
[1:12:28.400 --> 1:12:32.640]  but i don't put on airs as some super intellectual i don't talk like this
[1:12:32.640 --> 1:12:36.880]  and so some people because i don't talk like this because i have a texas accent
[1:12:36.880 --> 1:12:41.120]  they have the mindless small minded stereotype that i'm you know a knuckle
[1:12:41.120 --> 1:12:45.520]  dragging a person that rides horses to work
[1:12:45.520 --> 1:12:48.720]  i mean it's just so stupid ladies and gentlemen
[1:12:48.720 --> 1:12:53.920]  and i'm i'm i'm here covering the reality and people can laugh at that guy
[1:12:53.920 --> 1:12:57.440]  but there are thousands of people online
[1:12:57.440 --> 1:13:01.440]  who believe that i am a four trillion year old reptilian ruler
[1:13:01.440 --> 1:13:04.720]  um
[1:13:04.720 --> 1:13:08.560]  it's all part of the mental illness of the public just because we're able to
[1:13:08.560 --> 1:13:11.920]  wake up the mass out there because of my great listeners to spread the word
[1:13:11.920 --> 1:13:15.440]  doesn't mean that you that you can wake somebody up there's a tyrannical world
[1:13:15.440 --> 1:13:20.160]  government but
[1:13:20.160 --> 1:13:25.760]  then they get spun off into the hate the jews movement or it's only the
[1:13:25.760 --> 1:13:28.000]  catholics movement or it's the reptilians or it's the
[1:13:28.000 --> 1:13:32.240]  scientologists or it's the when evil is in all groups and all
[1:13:32.240 --> 1:13:36.640]  organizations and all you know derivations of the human race and we
[1:13:36.640 --> 1:13:40.240]  need to fight the systems of evil and the thought systems and the
[1:13:40.240 --> 1:13:43.520]  philosophy of corruption
[1:13:44.080 --> 1:13:48.400]  and so people are going to attack me and they're going to say stuff like that
[1:13:48.400 --> 1:13:52.160]  and i you know it doesn't even bother me that people
[1:13:52.160 --> 1:13:55.840]  make stuff up about me and attack me it only
[1:13:55.840 --> 1:13:59.920]  upsets me because i know we need every
[1:13:59.920 --> 1:14:02.960]  awake person to be focused on waking others up
[1:14:02.960 --> 1:14:07.360]  instead of acting like fools i apologize for spending five minutes on that
[1:14:07.360 --> 1:14:11.200]  ah god help us uh that's why i should just get to more calls because then we

[1:14:34.080 --> 1:14:38.640]  and uh what would the world do they would uh try to
[1:14:38.640 --> 1:14:43.440]  you know stop us they probably try to start a war with us if you know we were
[1:14:43.440 --> 1:14:47.120]  there with other globalists would plunge the economy probably assassinating
[1:14:47.120 --> 1:14:50.320]  but that was the the whole point was getting him to run to educate people to
[1:14:50.320 --> 1:14:53.520]  show people an alternative to the controlled republicans and
[1:14:53.520 --> 1:14:55.680]  controlled democrats that are really in a one-party
[1:14:55.680 --> 1:14:58.960]  dictatorship or or or identical twins just in different
[1:14:58.960 --> 1:15:03.840]  outfits uh and so it's all part of a process
[1:15:03.840 --> 1:15:09.680]  now being for real than how it is now you know
[1:15:09.680 --> 1:15:13.840]  absolutely what do you think about the election uh i voted
[1:15:13.840 --> 1:15:18.320]  uh for john mccain because guns and you know i'm
[1:15:18.320 --> 1:15:22.240]  i'm christian but i know it's all they're both kind on the same kind of
[1:15:22.240 --> 1:15:28.000]  deal you know but uh i just can't believe indiana term blue
[1:15:28.000 --> 1:15:32.880]  but uh i guess it's all it's all they're all on the same
[1:15:32.880 --> 1:15:36.080]  well i believe i mean i believe barack obama really did win
[1:15:36.080 --> 1:15:38.640]  and so they didn't have to steal the election for him but he was the air
[1:15:38.640 --> 1:15:41.840]  apparent but but that's what hype does that's the
[1:15:41.840 --> 1:15:45.600]  bandwagon effect i appreciate your call let's go to another caller here let's
[1:15:45.600 --> 1:15:50.000]  go to uh joe and pa go ahead joe hey alex how you doing
[1:15:50.000 --> 1:15:53.440]  um well i was listening to you this morning
[1:15:53.440 --> 1:15:57.280]  or when you first got on and uh all i can tell you is uh
[1:15:57.280 --> 1:16:00.560]  take a deep breath and feel good about yourself because
[1:16:00.560 --> 1:16:05.200]  um those people out there that are turning their backs on you now and
[1:16:05.200 --> 1:16:08.880]  and saying you're this way or that way people who
[1:16:08.880 --> 1:16:12.480]  seek the truth will follow the truth no matter where it goes
[1:16:12.480 --> 1:16:16.080]  and those people i'm not even worried about a few you know democrats on there
[1:16:16.080 --> 1:16:19.040]  suddenly supporting war and tyranny and torture and
[1:16:19.040 --> 1:16:24.080]  secret arrest and everything and gun control it's that
[1:16:24.080 --> 1:16:29.920]  i'm just upset by just seeing people get conned is upsetting
[1:16:29.920 --> 1:16:33.360]  um there was another thing i would like to let you know about too
[1:16:33.360 --> 1:16:38.880]  uh i don't know if you saw this enough but uh this morning on fox news that says
[1:16:38.880 --> 1:16:45.120]  could obama appoint a climate czar uh it was a Arnold sportsman
[1:16:45.120 --> 1:16:49.760]  yeah and they said uh they want it's a per person to one person to go around
[1:16:49.760 --> 1:16:52.080]  and make sure everybody's doing the right thing
[1:16:52.080 --> 1:16:57.120]  and also there was a a person on there they were talking about the newspapers
[1:16:57.120 --> 1:16:59.680]  going out of business because they were all supportants about
[1:16:59.680 --> 1:17:03.840]  obama and they're all going into the online
[1:17:03.840 --> 1:17:07.920]  forum and it kind of scared me because it made me think
[1:17:07.920 --> 1:17:11.760]  that when internet too comes along and it's so expensive
[1:17:11.760 --> 1:17:14.320]  that's right they're doing away with the written word the people are going to
[1:17:14.320 --> 1:17:17.600]  get dumbed out even more that's right no no i have thought those very thoughts
[1:17:17.600 --> 1:17:19.600]  and meant to make that point many times on air
[1:17:19.600 --> 1:17:24.480]  that's why the broadsheet even if it's three or four pages
[1:17:24.480 --> 1:17:28.160]  literally you know at a local print shop with a few sponsors
[1:17:28.160 --> 1:17:33.840]  we need to support alternative uh you know rags as they're called everywhere
[1:17:33.840 --> 1:17:39.040]  and that is so effective people love newspapers and they're always going to
[1:17:39.040 --> 1:17:43.440]  work you know pass them on keep them longer i don't care if it's a one sheet
[1:17:43.440 --> 1:17:45.440]  of paper with print on the front and the back
[1:17:45.440 --> 1:17:53.120]  we know with basic info that is what turn this country around in the 1770s
[1:17:53.120 --> 1:17:56.640]  and so we can do it again my friend as far as i'm concerned
[1:17:56.640 --> 1:18:00.320]  i voted my conscience i voted for ralph nader because i don't like
[1:18:00.320 --> 1:18:04.800]  either mccain or obama and we're gonna have to fight the good fight
[1:18:04.800 --> 1:18:09.760]  but now the democrats are saying ralph nader is a right-wing fascist racist
[1:18:09.760 --> 1:18:16.080]  you're not allowed to not love the new lord
[1:18:16.080 --> 1:18:19.920]  our beloved republic is on her knees the forces of globalism are destroying

[1:24:14.480 --> 1:24:18.000]  underlying underlying things they're doing and a lot of stuff about the
[1:24:18.000 --> 1:24:21.360]  concentration camps that i found out not only through info wars but from
[1:24:21.360 --> 1:24:25.280]  different videos and pictures i've seen we've got army.mil
[1:24:25.280 --> 1:24:28.000]  and they'll tell you where they're all at you can go see them right now
[1:24:28.000 --> 1:24:31.280]  right well yeah well i've actually looked at that and i've been uh i've been
[1:24:31.280 --> 1:24:34.480]  sharing it with a bunch of my friends but what else can i tell you and kind of
[1:24:34.480 --> 1:24:38.560]  ask you also is uh one of my friends was on the phone yesterday for about an
[1:24:38.560 --> 1:24:42.560]  hour and a half talking about it to another buddy who was out of state
[1:24:42.560 --> 1:24:46.080]  and uh our other buddy has a blackberry phone i also know a lot of the stuff
[1:24:46.080 --> 1:24:48.800]  about those how they're kind of used for corruptness
[1:24:48.800 --> 1:24:52.880]  and um about three o'clock three thirty in the morning last night both of my
[1:24:52.880 --> 1:24:56.240]  buddies that were on the phone one of them who was with me so i'm a hundred
[1:24:56.240 --> 1:25:00.320]  percent sure it's not a lie um got a phone call about
[1:25:00.320 --> 1:25:04.880]  three fifteen in the morning that was from FEMA
[1:25:04.880 --> 1:25:08.960]  and they hung up on the on this in the line so we called it back we didn't know
[1:25:08.960 --> 1:25:11.360]  what the number was we called it back and i mean it
[1:25:11.360 --> 1:25:15.040]  obviously said it was a federal emergency managed agency and then the other
[1:25:15.040 --> 1:25:18.640]  guy called us about three a.m the other guy that he had been talking to
[1:25:18.640 --> 1:25:22.400]  earlier on the phone and said that he had just gotten the same call and they
[1:25:22.400 --> 1:25:26.320]  had been asking him they asked him his full name they said is this your name

[1:25:29.440 --> 1:25:33.280]  information and i was wondering what that might i believe that uh in fact we've
[1:25:33.280 --> 1:25:37.200]  got that in some previous documents they have computers
[1:25:37.200 --> 1:25:40.880]  listening to everything every email every call everything's recorded
[1:25:40.880 --> 1:25:44.320]  and now they want the public to know in fact it's all over mainstream news today
[1:25:44.320 --> 1:25:47.360]  that they're listening to everything including your phone
[1:25:47.360 --> 1:25:51.520]  section they do that to humiliate you to demoralize you
[1:25:51.520 --> 1:25:55.120]  now they're ready to intimidate now they're ready to go ahead and tell the
[1:25:55.120 --> 1:25:59.760]  slave public yes it's tyranny yes the army standing by yes we're listening
[1:25:59.760 --> 1:26:03.760]  to you so they have computers listening and then uh and i've seen similar
[1:26:03.760 --> 1:26:06.320]  things happen i mean i get it all the time i'm gonna kill you i'm gonna kill
[1:26:06.320 --> 1:26:10.320]  your family from government numbers we're watching you

[1:26:15.120 --> 1:26:19.440]  they pay the army a lot of hundreds of thousands extra separate
[1:26:19.440 --> 1:26:24.000]  uh just corrupt cash i mean i'm talking army sergeants you name it
[1:26:24.000 --> 1:26:26.880]  to do this and they have private corporations that are doing it
[1:26:26.880 --> 1:26:30.080]  uh they also hire phone banks out of country to do it
[1:26:30.080 --> 1:26:33.360]  and yeah there's a huge whisper campaign going on
[1:26:33.360 --> 1:26:36.640]  i mean i don't know about your particular case uh and i don't know if
[1:26:36.640 --> 1:26:41.200]  that's true or real uh but i do know that they do lots of harassment lots of
[1:26:41.200 --> 1:26:44.320]  calls now to go ahead and create panic and fear

[1:26:50.000 --> 1:26:52.640]  answer is resisting speaking out and saying

[1:32:44.160 --> 1:32:50.080]  like chickens with their heads cut off rumor mongering
[1:32:50.080 --> 1:32:54.000]  now let's just let the rumors end
[1:32:54.080 --> 1:32:56.640]  now i can give you a lot more history about continuity of government and
[1:32:56.640 --> 1:33:00.800]  secret fema camps and plans in the 50s and 60s and 70s but
[1:33:00.800 --> 1:33:04.480]  they really got going in the 80s
[1:33:06.560 --> 1:33:09.920]  and they went in in the 80s and 90s it didn't matter who was president it
[1:33:09.920 --> 1:33:13.600]  expanded each president building up to where we are now
[1:33:13.600 --> 1:33:18.960]  starting in 84 with rex 84
[1:33:20.080 --> 1:33:23.840]  rex to make the executive king
[1:33:24.480 --> 1:33:28.960]  to make the bankers king to make tyranny king
[1:33:29.840 --> 1:33:35.440]  and they reopened the manna czar prison camp where japanese were held
[1:33:35.440 --> 1:33:39.360]  the families they they reopened hundreds of world war two camps
[1:33:39.360 --> 1:33:42.560]  they went and repainted them put in new power new lines
[1:33:42.560 --> 1:33:46.240]  new mess halls and they just sit there
[1:33:47.760 --> 1:33:54.880]  and then in 1997 they declassified the 1986 secret
[1:33:54.880 --> 1:33:58.640]  concentration camp program called the civilian
[1:33:58.640 --> 1:34:02.560]  inmate labor camp program now that's the issue
[1:34:02.560 --> 1:34:10.320]  is that for 11 years they kept 12 camps
[1:34:10.320 --> 1:34:16.320]  secret and when they declassified it in 97 they said this
[1:34:16.320 --> 1:34:21.280]  has worked wonderfully we're now going to double it to 24
[1:34:21.280 --> 1:34:28.720]  they have people in them they could keep 12 giant
[1:34:28.720 --> 1:34:36.480]  army run federal prisons secret filled with people
[1:34:36.480 --> 1:34:42.640]  they now take state prisoners and it's secret how do they do it
[1:34:42.640 --> 1:34:48.320]  they tell the people uh you've got a 15 year sentence 20 year sentence
[1:34:49.200 --> 1:34:53.440]  we will contractually cut that in half if you agree to not tell your family
[1:34:53.440 --> 1:35:00.560]  where you are not accept visits and go to this work camp
[1:35:00.560 --> 1:35:04.480]  so we'll cut it from 15 years to eight years or we'll cut it from 20 years to
[1:35:04.480 --> 1:35:10.400]  10 years and then they sent them there tens of thousands of federal prisoners
[1:35:10.400 --> 1:35:20.400]  in secret camps for 10 years kept secret and so
[1:35:20.400 --> 1:35:24.480]  this radio show another radio shows would have army people running them
[1:35:24.480 --> 1:35:27.840]  call us i'd have people show up with their hands shaking from san antonio

[1:54:57.440 --> 1:55:00.720]  stop these rants i'm going to bring ted anderson up this segment the next
[1:55:00.720 --> 1:55:04.720]  though then we'll cover news then get back into your calls
[1:55:04.720 --> 1:55:08.240]  ted has been telling you you know gold sold out by most gold dealers in most
[1:55:08.240 --> 1:55:11.680]  places and if you can get it on average is a 30 premium
[1:55:11.680 --> 1:55:16.160]  ted happens to have high quality gold uh at below
[1:55:16.160 --> 1:55:19.520]  billion prices because he buys it when it's low below what it's selling for
[1:55:19.520 --> 1:55:23.840]  right now and there's no premium on so it's just a
[1:55:23.840 --> 1:55:26.640]  fabulous deals a lot of you've checked into that are now taking action and
[1:55:26.640 --> 1:55:31.440]  that's good um but ted did you sell out of the indians
[1:55:31.440 --> 1:55:35.920]  uh the indians we have just a few of those left and uh the uh philharmonic
[1:55:35.920 --> 1:55:38.720]  that i offered yesterday they're just completely gone
[1:55:38.720 --> 1:55:44.320]  uh the uh the canadian maple leaves one of the easiest cards to get into
[1:55:44.320 --> 1:55:47.040]  normally in most market circumstances are just
[1:55:47.040 --> 1:55:50.400]  absolutely tough to get those buffaloes we talked about
[1:55:50.400 --> 1:55:54.000]  i mean as i forget it at least you know until i can find any kind of supply on
[1:55:54.000 --> 1:55:59.280]  that at all i can't make that offer um the one thing that i do have my hands
[1:55:59.280 --> 1:56:02.800]  on right now and i just think that this is an incredible buy
[1:56:02.800 --> 1:56:06.880]  are the uh are the uh five dollar gold coins in proof condition
[1:56:06.880 --> 1:56:10.080]  now these ones not only are improved condition that have been issued by the
[1:56:10.080 --> 1:56:14.960]  u.s. mint as collector coins so they're exempt from that gold confiscation that
[1:56:14.960 --> 1:56:17.840]  everybody talks about there's no way that the united's governance united
[1:56:17.840 --> 1:56:21.680]  states government can say you have a billion coin when they sold it as a
[1:56:21.680 --> 1:56:24.800]  as a collector coin to start with it sold right out of the u.s. mint you had to
[1:56:24.800 --> 1:56:28.560]  order them at a premium right now i've got them and they're
[1:56:28.560 --> 1:56:34.080]  in there sitting in in in holders out of pcgs and ngc is ms 70s that means

[1:56:46.080 --> 1:56:49.680]  well in the in the in the circumstances in this particular case this coin
[1:56:49.680 --> 1:56:53.520]  carries a little bit of a premium but it is a day they're telling about all the

[1:59:31.920 --> 1:59:34.320]  i even have to argue with people that don't understand it's important to have
[1:59:34.320 --> 1:59:37.360]  gold and silver or horrible food or firearms or
[1:59:37.360 --> 1:59:40.400]  potassium iodate
[1:59:40.560 --> 1:59:43.760]  ten all right so you see you got some of those limited coins what else do you
[1:59:43.760 --> 1:59:46.640]  have ten i can tell you right now we're talking about the five dollar
[1:59:46.640 --> 1:59:49.680]  gold piece and here's the issue right now i've got everybody calling me up in
[1:59:49.680 --> 1:59:52.720]  there saying what about gold confiscation we have the banks that are
[1:59:52.720 --> 1:59:55.680]  failing around us we got the government trying to bail them out
[1:59:55.680 --> 1:59:59.680]  what about gold confiscation well the fact of the matter is is that franklin
[1:59:59.680 --> 2:00:03.520]  delano roosevelt confiscated gold in 1933 criminal piece of
[2:00:03.520 --> 2:00:07.520]  filth exactly but he did not take coins of
[2:00:07.520 --> 2:00:11.600]  collective realm and these coins were issued by the united states government
[2:00:11.600 --> 2:00:16.480]  as a collector piece the issue is that i mean i've been offering these five
[2:00:16.480 --> 2:00:19.200]  dollar gold pieces years ago they've they've
[2:00:19.200 --> 2:00:22.320]  they're gone nobody was able to get them there's nothing out there
[2:00:22.320 --> 2:00:27.520]  i've got a situation where i have a supply of five dollar gold pieces
[2:00:27.520 --> 2:00:32.160]  that you can get your hands on the they had been to the out of existence is
[2:00:32.160 --> 2:00:34.960]  there's been nothing out there we don't know how much are they said
[2:00:34.960 --> 2:00:39.600]  well currently right now the coins are at 384 but the neat part about these is
[2:00:39.600 --> 2:00:42.720]  that they're all proof and they're all certified
[2:00:42.720 --> 2:00:48.080]  by by professional coin grading services numismatic guarantee corporation
[2:00:48.080 --> 2:00:50.880]  they're all sitting in their slabs been certified
[2:00:50.880 --> 2:00:53.760]  there's no let me just stop you ted i think that's a great deal and a great
[2:00:53.760 --> 2:00:58.400]  coin i'm just going to be honest you know we shouldn't turn our gold in when
[2:00:58.400 --> 2:01:01.680]  these murdering bastards ask for it people say well why should have gold they
[2:01:01.680 --> 2:01:04.160]  can just confiscate it well they can take your kids too
[2:01:04.160 --> 2:01:07.120]  they can take your house they can take anything because they're murdering
[2:01:07.120 --> 2:01:12.320]  scumbag filthy degenerate bankers that have punks and thugs who think they're
[2:01:12.320 --> 2:01:16.480]  god in uniforms that work for them and i say they can go right to hell ted
[2:01:16.480 --> 2:01:20.640]  i'm not giving these bastards anything i agree with you a hundred percent is a
[2:01:20.640 --> 2:01:23.520]  filth pieces of trash degenerate criminals
[2:01:23.520 --> 2:01:27.600]  i have come filth i think there is no way that anybody could argue with that
[2:01:27.600 --> 2:01:30.560]  point i mean there is no reason why
[2:01:30.560 --> 2:01:35.280]  franklin delano rusevelt should have taken the liability the banks owed the
[2:01:35.280 --> 2:01:39.600]  gold to the people it was on deposit the certificates that the people were trying
[2:01:39.600 --> 2:01:44.480]  to turn in said redeemable and gold franklin delano rusevelt took the
[2:01:44.480 --> 2:01:48.000]  gold on a car please a great guy but i don't want to use keeps plugging that
[2:01:48.000 --> 2:01:50.880]  idiot the guy that helped take over the bankers
[2:01:50.880 --> 2:01:54.080]  rosevelt but whatever the point is what other coins you got to offer ted
[2:01:54.080 --> 2:01:57.520]  well and again if you want something that's real close to melt something
[2:01:57.520 --> 2:02:00.240]  that's tradable something that you can use as money
[2:02:00.240 --> 2:02:03.920]  the frank coin is the best coin to get i've been talking about that for a long
[2:02:03.920 --> 2:02:07.520]  time it is something that's how much of the Frank's they are currently trading
[2:02:07.520 --> 2:02:12.800]  right now at 198 and you can get into those and you can use those as money
[2:02:12.800 --> 2:02:16.800]  and the five dollar gold piece same thing i mean i can tell you right now
[2:02:16.800 --> 2:02:20.080]  there are a lot of people buying these on gold is at 300 dollars an ounce of
[2:02:20.080 --> 2:02:24.240]  selling these things for 99 bucks they've tripled their money on this guess
[2:02:24.240 --> 2:02:28.560]  what's going to happen in the future these this particular coin right now
[2:02:28.560 --> 2:02:33.200]  that's trading at 384 just following the same trend is going to be worth over a
[2:02:33.200 --> 2:02:37.440]  grand apiece all right 800 686 2237
[2:02:37.440 --> 2:02:40.720]  whole point is you can't get gold right now for most places
[2:02:40.720 --> 2:02:45.120]  ted has them without any premium on them any bottom before gold went up 50
[2:02:45.120 --> 2:02:49.520]  something bucks this week so bottom line to this is a great deal
[2:02:49.520 --> 2:02:54.080]  you can't get a better deal alex i swear you the stuff that's out there's
[2:02:54.080 --> 2:02:57.040]  nothing out there go to your local coin store and try to buy
[2:02:57.040 --> 2:03:00.800]  any kind of quantity of anything there's nothing 800 686

[2:03:16.720 --> 2:03:20.400]  hello friends this is alex jones i've told you for a long time it's important
[2:03:20.400 --> 2:03:23.760]  to be self-sufficient and today that's more important than ever we need to be
[2:03:23.760 --> 2:03:27.280]  independent and food and water is the key you'll never have to stand in a
[2:03:27.280 --> 2:03:30.560]  bread line if you have your own bread you'll never have to go to the super
[2:03:30.560 --> 2:03:32.960]  dome and beg for femur to take care of your family
[2:03:32.960 --> 2:03:36.880]  in any emergency if you simply prepare our elected representatives wanted a
[2:03:36.880 --> 2:03:40.400]  good old boy bailout of a special interest so they ignored your screams
[2:03:40.400 --> 2:03:42.960]  not to do it they turned off the telephones and email
[2:03:42.960 --> 2:03:46.320]  they voted to print eight hundred and fifty billion dollars at least out of
[2:03:46.320 --> 2:03:49.120]  thin air this money now owns the america and european
[2:03:49.120 --> 2:03:52.160]  banks the exploding inflation that is now guaranteed
[2:03:52.160 --> 2:03:55.200]  will slash your life savings to nothing and blast the cost of
[2:03:55.200 --> 2:03:59.600]  necessities particularly food beyond many americans reach in pre-nazi
[2:03:59.600 --> 2:04:03.120]  germany super inflation the cost of a loaf of bread doubled every two
[2:04:03.120 --> 2:04:05.920]  days until it reached over four billion marks
[2:04:05.920 --> 2:04:09.840]  food prices are skyrocketing so fast there seems as if there may be no end
[2:04:09.840 --> 2:04:13.680]  in sight the private banks merging with our government are refusing to loan
[2:04:13.680 --> 2:04:17.040]  grocery stores enough money to restock their shelves the stores have less
[2:04:17.040 --> 2:04:20.880]  food but jack of prices to stay in business whatever happens in america
[2:04:20.880 --> 2:04:24.400]  we need to be prepared and be ready everything is zeroing in on food
[2:04:24.400 --> 2:04:27.680]  one third of americans have to choose between buying food and paying for other
[2:04:27.680 --> 2:04:30.960]  necessities my friends whatever it takes get prepared
[2:04:30.960 --> 2:04:34.400]  get self-sufficient get food for everybody out there listening it's very
[2:04:34.400 --> 2:04:37.520]  important for you to understand that by having a supply of storable food the
[2:04:37.520 --> 2:04:40.240]  government the new old order has a lot less control over you
[2:04:40.240 --> 2:04:44.480]  and so it's a mindset a mindset of self-sufficiency and preparedness no one

[2:07:11.680 --> 2:07:15.040]  into the gold business you know trying to buy trying to buy
[2:07:15.040 --> 2:07:17.840]  gold and silver coins right now is a tough job
[2:07:17.840 --> 2:07:20.880]  uh trying to find people to buy gold and silver coins right now is not that
[2:07:20.880 --> 2:07:23.680]  tough i mean it's there's people coming out of the woodwork from everywhere that
[2:07:23.680 --> 2:07:28.160]  want this stuff uh the way that uh the way that i do it is i try to look
[2:07:28.160 --> 2:07:31.920]  into the marketplace and examine it and following gold for
[2:07:31.920 --> 2:07:34.800]  30 years now i can kind of tell when things are bottoming out and what's
[2:07:34.800 --> 2:07:38.160]  going to happen and you kind of look at the the financial news
[2:07:38.160 --> 2:07:42.960]  um you know i've been uh you know robert prector elliot wave theory i you know
[2:07:42.960 --> 2:07:46.480]  there's a lot of things that i look at and uh and i try to make a
[2:07:46.480 --> 2:07:49.760]  guesstimate as to what's going to happen here when you you know when we had that
[2:07:49.760 --> 2:07:52.880]  bailout coming along the prices of gold are coming down i just thought no i'm
[2:07:52.880 --> 2:07:55.760]  going to be i'm going to have to pick some up here at some of the lower levels
[2:07:55.760 --> 2:07:58.880]  and then the prices start shooting up and then yeah and then i got supply and i
[2:07:58.880 --> 2:08:03.200]  can deliver um that's that's the main thing i you know the way
[2:08:03.200 --> 2:08:06.960]  i mean there's a lot of things that i can't get either um i i just have to
[2:08:06.960 --> 2:08:10.320]  continue to look into the marketplace try to find out what i can buy that's a
[2:08:10.320 --> 2:08:13.680]  reasonable price something that's actually going to be good for my customers
[2:08:13.680 --> 2:08:17.840]  to have and then uh and then strike my best deal
[2:08:17.840 --> 2:08:21.040]  buy as much as i can and keep it in supply that it's a very simple equation
[2:08:21.040 --> 2:08:24.800]  it looks like to me you've been in the business a long time you buy in bulk
[2:08:24.800 --> 2:08:28.160]  and so you're still able to get the really low prices and you pass
[2:08:28.160 --> 2:08:32.720]  that on to the customers with a tiny markup yeah we've always tried to keep
[2:08:32.720 --> 2:08:36.960]  the margins very thin um as thin as we can keep them uh because the customers
[2:08:36.960 --> 2:08:40.080]  get more gold and silver that are happier yeah you got you got great
[2:08:40.080 --> 2:08:45.520]  deals on frank's great deals on british sovereign's uh and uh great deals on
[2:08:45.520 --> 2:08:49.840]  the um what was that particular it's a five dollar gold piece that you know if
[2:08:49.840 --> 2:08:52.880]  you ever if you ever get a chance to pick up a red book you can see that the
[2:08:52.880 --> 2:08:56.560]  united states mint has been issuing two collectors only
[2:08:56.560 --> 2:09:01.760]  five dollar gold pieces since about 1987 and uh they've been issued a price
[2:09:01.760 --> 2:09:04.720]  it's about this level this is getting back okay well let's just give them a

[2:10:59.280 --> 2:11:04.080]  here brad and arizona you're on the air go ahead

[2:11:14.400 --> 2:11:19.360]  running giant right plans and so it came out that every major youth facility
[2:11:19.360 --> 2:11:23.200]  the state run was run by pedophiles and they had public rapings where the cops
[2:11:23.200 --> 2:11:25.840]  and judges would pull up and go into rape children
[2:11:25.840 --> 2:11:29.600]  i mean no one got in trouble i mean six months ago
[2:11:29.600 --> 2:11:33.760]  six months ago i mean i was one of these people you're talking about that
[2:11:33.760 --> 2:11:38.480]  doesn't know about this information and i heard your show
[2:11:38.480 --> 2:11:42.480]  um and actually heard you talk on another radio station as well
[2:11:42.480 --> 2:11:48.400]  um and i at first i was acting i was kind of pissed i was
[2:11:48.400 --> 2:11:51.680]  frustrated but you know what i looked up some of the stuff
[2:11:51.680 --> 2:11:55.120]  you've been talking about and that's when i started becoming enlightened
[2:11:55.120 --> 2:11:59.600]  and i think these people that have been calling in on today in this show and
[2:11:59.600 --> 2:12:04.400]  probably another ones that are to come that are
[2:12:04.400 --> 2:12:07.440]  uh frustrated or you know now you're trying to bring it down
[2:12:07.440 --> 2:12:10.240]  i think that's more out of fear i mean because the things you're talking
[2:12:10.240 --> 2:12:14.560]  about freak people out it freaks people out and i think you need to look at
[2:12:14.560 --> 2:12:19.200]  oh brother i freaked out too yeah but i mean you got to see it that way so let
[2:12:19.200 --> 2:12:23.680]  them bring it down because they're acting out of fear and they're scared
[2:12:23.680 --> 2:12:28.240]  and uh hey i want to thank you as a fellow human being and as fellow
[2:12:28.240 --> 2:12:31.760]  american that you're actually putting this information out here
[2:12:31.760 --> 2:12:34.800]  and i think uh you had another caller that was asking well what
[2:12:34.800 --> 2:12:39.920]  should we do when you mentioned you know getting flyers on a car is starting
[2:12:39.920 --> 2:12:46.240]  blogs i mean is that it can we do more no make your own films uh put video to
[2:12:46.240 --> 2:12:50.400]  clips i mean the web is where we can reach run for office i mean well yeah
[2:12:50.400 --> 2:12:53.200]  run for office go to your county commissioners
[2:12:53.200 --> 2:12:57.120]  court or city council read the civilian m a labor camp program from the army
[2:12:57.120 --> 2:12:59.840]  itself and hand out to everybody in there
[2:12:59.840 --> 2:13:03.920]  the the the crowd of people the county commissioners their aides
[2:13:03.920 --> 2:13:06.960]  hand them little printouts you don't come with a hundred here here's from the
[2:13:06.960 --> 2:13:10.880]  army with camps this was secret until a few years ago
[2:13:10.880 --> 2:13:14.400]  see that's an evil corrupt government running secret camps and i mean you know
[2:13:14.400 --> 2:13:17.600]  it's just it's all a process we can't trust these people
[2:13:17.600 --> 2:13:20.240]  you know i mean that's what happens you get evil people in they bring more
[2:13:20.240 --> 2:13:23.520]  evil people in and they bring in more people in and they bring in more evil
[2:13:23.520 --> 2:13:26.480]  people and we've reached a critical mass of just arrogant
[2:13:26.480 --> 2:13:29.600]  criminals like to hurt people they like to cheat people
[2:13:29.600 --> 2:13:34.960]  they like to con people they enjoy it and and and and so the sky's the limit
[2:13:34.960 --> 2:13:37.200]  with these people they're not going to give us quarter
[2:13:37.200 --> 2:13:42.000]  they're not going to stop and i'm sick of it man i i'm tired of them
[2:13:42.000 --> 2:13:45.840]  you know ted talked about roosevelt i talked to my grandmother about it she
[2:13:45.840 --> 2:13:50.080]  remembers it she's like 85 years old now you know they came and they
[2:13:50.080 --> 2:13:53.520]  made them all turn their gold in for paper money and then they doubled the
[2:13:53.520 --> 2:13:56.560]  price of it you know we've been people should have just
[2:13:56.560 --> 2:14:01.040]  told them no but we were still trusting it just it's criminals
[2:14:01.040 --> 2:14:03.920]  well alex you've been talking about this for 13 years you get you take it for
[2:14:03.920 --> 2:14:06.800]  granted it's people that are hearing this information for the first time
[2:14:06.800 --> 2:14:10.720]  and it's kind of hard to digest because it's a lot of stuff
[2:14:10.720 --> 2:14:14.880]  and you know i i think the best way to understand for somebody who's been a
[2:14:14.880 --> 2:14:17.040]  while that you've been enlightened all this
[2:14:17.040 --> 2:14:23.680]  is uh like in a movie uh like the matrix where neo is takes the blue red pill if
[2:14:23.680 --> 2:14:28.240]  you i mean this starting to understand and see the facts
[2:14:28.240 --> 2:14:32.480]  here i mean it's a shocker it changes your perspective on things and
[2:14:32.480 --> 2:14:37.280]  it freaks people out i mean some people won't be able to handle
[2:14:37.280 --> 2:14:41.280]  well it's not going to stop until we wake up and i just get discouraged by
[2:14:41.280 --> 2:14:44.240]  barack obama is going to do everything bush did more
[2:14:44.240 --> 2:14:48.640]  and all these idiots refuse to even look at the evidence
[2:14:48.640 --> 2:14:52.080]  i mean they'll read an article on prisonplanet.com with all the facts like
[2:14:52.080 --> 2:14:55.120]  meet the new boss same as the old boss and then they'll just comment under it
[2:14:55.120 --> 2:14:58.000]  oh you just don't like democrats and black people
[2:14:58.000 --> 2:15:01.600]  and then we just gave them all the proof and they don't even care
[2:15:01.600 --> 2:15:05.520]  it's like republicans that wouldn't wake up the bush they're just so wedded
[2:15:05.520 --> 2:15:10.720]  to lies that they're gonna allow themselves to be destroyed
[2:15:10.720 --> 2:15:14.080]  well i think maybe folks think is that you know what at the beginning initially
[2:15:14.080 --> 2:15:17.920]  really i would say the same stuff but i actually looked up the facts
[2:15:17.920 --> 2:15:20.880]  because you actually gave some sources and i started looking at stuff up
[2:15:20.880 --> 2:15:26.560]  that's when i started to see stuff myself and i think uh obviously people
[2:15:26.560 --> 2:15:29.440]  need to change their minds themselves you're never going to change somebody's
[2:15:29.440 --> 2:15:33.200]  mind you know by just forcing it they have to see the facts
[2:15:33.200 --> 2:15:37.280]  that enlighten themselves and decide that this is what's going on
[2:15:37.280 --> 2:15:40.480]  um and i think that's what's important obviously you're putting the information
[2:15:40.480 --> 2:15:43.440]  out there and that's great i'm grateful for you doing that
[2:15:43.440 --> 2:15:46.560]  well look at look look look look i don't do the best job at this and i shouldn't
[2:15:46.560 --> 2:15:49.840]  blow up and freak out but the main reason i've been able to wake up so many
[2:15:49.840 --> 2:15:53.040]  people is the fact that it's real i really am
[2:15:53.040 --> 2:15:56.400]  concerned i really am freaked out and you know people can say oh that's
[2:15:56.400 --> 2:16:00.320]  fear mongering look at what's happening everything we told people is
[2:16:00.320 --> 2:16:03.280]  happening i was only reading their own documents
[2:16:03.280 --> 2:16:07.760]  they say they're doing it to us they say they're gonna kill us
[2:16:07.760 --> 2:16:12.400]  don't people understand that just and i apologize if you mentioned this before

[2:22:24.000 --> 2:22:27.360]  i got a call from my boss yesterday he's sick and tired of it all
[2:22:27.360 --> 2:22:31.760]  and we're planning on uh uh infiltrating the central committees going to their
[2:22:31.760 --> 2:22:36.640]  meetings making some noise is there any any advice he can give us
[2:22:36.640 --> 2:22:40.080]  well you're talking about going to local political events and things
[2:22:40.080 --> 2:22:43.200]  right exactly
[2:22:43.200 --> 2:22:47.520]  well i mean i would just go and act friendly and give them copies of films
[2:22:47.520 --> 2:22:50.480]  that's for the most effective things people are visual learners especially
[2:22:50.480 --> 2:22:56.000]  now on the tv age when nobody really reads you can give them audio cds
[2:22:56.000 --> 2:23:02.880]  you can um go and say well why isn't obama ending the war why isn't obama
[2:23:02.880 --> 2:23:08.240]  repealing all these drug laws or you can get the conservatives fired up and go
[2:23:08.240 --> 2:23:11.600]  look he's openly announcing he's coming out of the guns
[2:23:11.600 --> 2:23:15.600]  i mean they're in the news today saying i mean that the their instinct is to
[2:23:15.600 --> 2:23:19.600]  disarm the slaves they understand that that's about domination
[2:23:19.600 --> 2:23:23.280]  if they can't get you on welfare and in a slave grid where you can on guns and
[2:23:23.280 --> 2:23:26.800]  government projects they'll just take your guns and so i think really you
[2:23:26.800 --> 2:23:31.600]  know hammer that gun control aspect that they're coming for our guns
[2:23:31.600 --> 2:23:34.960]  and that they and that they're you know we don't need more
[2:23:34.960 --> 2:23:38.240]  more of these federalized police that's what all your local cops are basically
[2:23:38.240 --> 2:23:41.200]  federalized now but we just got to fight their system
[2:23:41.200 --> 2:23:44.480]  yeah because i know it's it's i went to meeting last year and i stepped in
[2:23:44.480 --> 2:23:48.560]  right in the lion's lear and where it was during the ron paul campaign and
[2:23:48.560 --> 2:23:52.000]  boy did we get you they tried to shut us down real quick but there was ten of us
[2:23:52.000 --> 2:23:56.240]  and ten of them was all when you say central committee what did you go to
[2:23:56.240 --> 2:23:59.520]  uh... actually well i went to the young republicans it's a it was a branch of
[2:23:59.520 --> 2:24:03.280]  the uh... the uh... the uh... uh... current county central committee
[2:24:03.280 --> 2:24:06.880]  you know as uh... which is led by uh... i'm sure you've heard of them uh
[2:24:06.880 --> 2:24:11.440]  mark albernafi whose wife was part of the putting of the
[2:24:11.440 --> 2:24:14.480]  reinstating the uh... fairness doctrine yeah
[2:24:14.480 --> 2:24:18.480]  well i mean that's what you get is they understand controlling the grassroots
[2:24:18.480 --> 2:24:21.600]  is important sober your local liberals and local conservatives
[2:24:21.600 --> 2:24:24.960]  you've got these establishment hacks who are part of the system
[2:24:24.960 --> 2:24:28.080]  and then they report up the chain of command and it's all about neutralizing
[2:24:28.080 --> 2:24:31.760]  people it's all about suckering people it's all about deceiving the public
[2:24:31.760 --> 2:24:35.520]  it's all about controlling both parties and uh... yeah we just need more
[2:24:35.520 --> 2:24:39.120]  people to to to physically go into the machine
[2:24:39.120 --> 2:24:45.840]  and uh... witness what's happening and then tell others
[2:24:45.840 --> 2:24:50.560]  and believe me the system the system knows that we're growing the liberties
[2:24:50.560 --> 2:24:54.320]  expanding that's why they're admitting they're spying on people admitting
[2:24:54.320 --> 2:24:57.280]  they're going to use the army you know they're trying to intimidate those of
[2:24:57.280 --> 2:25:00.480]  us in the know they're trying to say yeah we will you know
[2:25:00.480 --> 2:25:03.280]  that's why they got tv shows where they demonize constitutionalists and
[2:25:03.280 --> 2:25:06.560]  patriots and where you know in the different dramas you know that the
[2:25:06.560 --> 2:25:10.000]  the patriots are going to blow something up it's all part of that false
[2:25:10.000 --> 2:25:14.320]  reality because we are threat to these criminals i appreciate your call
[2:25:14.320 --> 2:25:17.920]  let's go ahead and talk to uh... andrew in california go ahead you're on the
[2:25:17.920 --> 2:25:19.120]  air
[2:25:19.120 --> 2:25:22.320]  alex at the dollar is devalued in january
[2:25:22.320 --> 2:25:26.640]  how will that affect the average american well that's in the newspapers that
[2:25:26.640 --> 2:25:29.360]  they're talking about the valuing and having a new currency
[2:25:29.360 --> 2:25:33.280]  i don't know they're gonna do it then but the point is um...
[2:25:33.280 --> 2:25:38.240]  how will that affect what just the average american citizen
[2:25:38.240 --> 2:25:41.760]  your savings will be debased your buying power will be debased
[2:25:41.760 --> 2:25:46.560]  um... i mean that's basically all it comes down to
[2:25:46.560 --> 2:25:50.480]  uh... is that people on fixed incomes will be hurt the worst
[2:25:50.480 --> 2:25:54.080]  people won't be able to pay for their houses it'll accelerate people defaulting
[2:25:54.080 --> 2:25:57.760]  on credit cards the feds are talking about not even letting you default not
[2:25:57.760 --> 2:25:59.600]  even letting you get out of a mortgage
[2:25:59.600 --> 2:26:03.680]  somehow uh... seizing everything you've got separate from that
[2:26:03.680 --> 2:26:07.120]  uh... it just means they're closing in they want to bring down the economy
[2:26:07.120 --> 2:26:11.280]  and have a police state to orderly take everything we've got
[2:26:11.280 --> 2:26:14.000]  and and and bring us into being a third world nation really overnight like
[2:26:14.000 --> 2:26:16.560]  argentina or greenland
[2:26:16.560 --> 2:26:21.680]  do you have any idea how much they're thinking about the valuing the dollar
[2:26:21.680 --> 2:26:25.040]  i mean they're already devalued it massively i mean it's just going to
[2:26:25.040 --> 2:26:28.320]  continue with hyperinflation over 20 percent a year
[2:26:28.320 --> 2:26:30.960]  okay it's just going to be a gradual process then
[2:26:30.960 --> 2:26:34.400]  well i mean no they're talking about openly killing the dollars the world
[2:26:34.400 --> 2:26:38.400]  reserve currency and if they do that then countries
[2:26:38.400 --> 2:26:41.280]  we're not going to be able to buy all these slave goods anymore is cheap

[2:32:17.520 --> 2:32:20.240]  they all work together to cover each other's butts but
[2:32:20.240 --> 2:32:23.200]  that's all being revealed these people have a nine percent approval rating and
[2:32:23.200 --> 2:32:26.160]  it's dropping and they know and they hope they can
[2:32:26.160 --> 2:32:29.040]  sucker you with obama but they know that's not gonna last long that's why
[2:32:29.040 --> 2:32:32.720]  they're taking the gloves off and going okay the army's here
[2:32:32.720 --> 2:32:36.000]  that's why they want to bankrupt you so you don't have money so you're starving
[2:32:36.000 --> 2:32:39.920]  to death so so so you're right at subsistence
[2:32:39.920 --> 2:32:42.880]  so you got to leave your kids at school 15 hours a day you know
[2:32:42.880 --> 2:32:47.600]  after school now to work two three jobs so the state can raise them
[2:32:47.600 --> 2:32:51.840]  these are social engineers these are cold-blooded people
[2:32:52.160 --> 2:32:55.440]  and and and being in denial is what's brought us to this point okay i i got a
[2:32:55.440 --> 2:32:59.440]  hurry now there's a lot coming up um
[2:32:59.440 --> 2:33:05.680]  let's go ahead and who's up next here is it
[2:33:05.680 --> 2:33:12.000]  austin in ally leon arizona go ahead
[2:33:12.640 --> 2:33:16.160]  go ahead leigh hi alex i'm first time caller
[2:33:16.160 --> 2:33:19.280]  i've been following your work for a really long time and uh
[2:33:19.280 --> 2:33:22.720]  your personal hero of mine and i'd just like to thank you for doing god's work
[2:33:22.720 --> 2:33:27.280]  and uh i wanted to maybe see if you talk about a little bit of the uh
[2:33:27.280 --> 2:33:30.800]  army mind control programs and some of the some of the things i think they're
[2:33:30.800 --> 2:33:34.880]  dehumanizing the police and they're dehumanizing the army so that they
[2:33:34.880 --> 2:33:38.480]  are just going to blindly follow this thing and blindly round up uh
[2:33:38.480 --> 2:33:42.480]  american citizens well in afghanistan and iraq they admit they've been testing
[2:33:42.480 --> 2:33:46.880]  amnesics aggression drugs steroids other things on the trips that was in
[2:33:46.880 --> 2:33:51.040]  wire magazine about four years ago uh and it was the
[2:33:51.040 --> 2:33:55.200]  the headline was the marshal plan or the new marshal plan because the name of
[2:33:55.200 --> 2:33:59.600]  their futurist is dr marshal and that's just one place of thousands where they
[2:33:59.600 --> 2:34:03.360]  admit it uh but mainly it's social conditioning not letting you sleep
[2:34:03.360 --> 2:34:07.440]  shaving your head brainwashing you screaming at you
[2:34:07.440 --> 2:34:11.840]  uh the um that's what fraternities and all that are
[2:34:11.840 --> 2:34:15.040]  you know the oh that's just having fun and limbaugh said oh the torture at abu
[2:34:15.040 --> 2:34:20.880]  graib that's like a fraternity prank but but in a way those are lighter forms
[2:34:20.880 --> 2:34:25.360]  of how the cults thousands of years ago would brainwash their members
[2:34:25.360 --> 2:34:28.320]  making them stand in freezing water not letting them eat screaming at them for
[2:34:28.320 --> 2:34:32.320]  days on end and then they and then that breaks you down and there was a value
[2:34:32.320 --> 2:34:36.160]  of going through that crisis to you psychologically and so now you're part
[2:34:36.160 --> 2:34:39.760]  of this brotherhood it's not really your it's there to use you abuse you
[2:34:39.760 --> 2:34:44.320]  throw you out your garbage to yet but your mind control i mean water people
[2:34:44.320 --> 2:34:47.680]  chanting and yelling with shaved heads dress the same
[2:34:47.680 --> 2:34:52.000]  if anybody else does that as a cult but when it's the military oh no it's
[2:34:52.000 --> 2:34:56.480]  wonderful and it's good uh and i'm not overall saying to have good
[2:34:56.480 --> 2:35:00.320]  soldiers and beat people that you know historically
[2:35:00.320 --> 2:35:03.520]  they're having you know that some of that regimentation and mind control
[2:35:03.520 --> 2:35:07.680]  didn't make good soldiers it did but now it's much more sophisticated in the
[2:35:07.680 --> 2:35:10.560]  public's being brainwashed through tv and media and
[2:35:10.560 --> 2:35:15.200]  you're not just the semantics or the way they twist it but just a whole deal
[2:35:15.200 --> 2:35:18.720]  uh and so yes but but more importantly it's selection
[2:35:18.720 --> 2:35:22.080]  they find out who likes to kill families they find out
[2:35:22.080 --> 2:35:25.120]  you know it's it's institutionalized how to leave a drop weapon when you kill
[2:35:25.120 --> 2:35:28.320]  innocent people they promote the guys that kill innocent people
[2:35:28.320 --> 2:35:31.520]  and the people who don't like it well you know they just kick them out or
[2:35:31.520 --> 2:35:34.960]  send them home or you know put them in the front line combat but the guys that
[2:35:34.960 --> 2:35:39.520]  answer the questionnaires and you know that they will
[2:35:39.520 --> 2:35:45.360]  fire on american citizens they get promoted understand what about like
[2:35:45.360 --> 2:35:48.240]  pharmaceutical companies and different things like that you think like pro
[2:35:48.240 --> 2:35:52.000]  tech and well that's in the news today that they're not just giving total
[2:35:52.000 --> 2:35:55.120]  immunity to the vaccine makers now they're about to give total immunity
[2:35:55.120 --> 2:35:59.440]  that's up on info wars dot com right now to all the drug makers
[2:35:59.440 --> 2:36:02.400]  see now they're saying hey melamine's good for you hey mercury's good
[2:36:02.400 --> 2:36:06.160]  hey you know what doesn't matter what a drug does we're just not going to say
[2:36:06.160 --> 2:36:08.240]  it hurts you anymore even if it kills you
[2:36:08.240 --> 2:36:11.680]  see i mean it's just total corruption we're going to steal everything from
[2:36:11.680 --> 2:36:15.200]  the banks we're going to make you take drugs that kill you
[2:36:15.200 --> 2:36:17.920]  and and then give total immunity to the people
[2:36:17.920 --> 2:36:21.760]  who made them i mean see uh we're going to let private corporations take your
[2:36:21.760 --> 2:36:25.200]  private property now you know that was a supreme court ruling
[2:36:25.200 --> 2:36:28.480]  three years ago i mean they're just going for broke
[2:36:28.480 --> 2:36:33.040]  they're just doing whatever they want they are just
[2:36:33.040 --> 2:36:36.960]  they're dropping the pretense of any freedom or checks and balances
[2:36:36.960 --> 2:36:40.320]  they're just going for broke brother yeah totally
[2:36:40.320 --> 2:36:44.400]  well thanks a lot have a nice day thank you
[2:36:44.400 --> 2:36:48.080]  i mean i'm sorry to have to put it that way folks but that's what's so scary
[2:36:48.080 --> 2:36:50.960]  about this even people that are into corruption they only see their own
[2:36:50.960 --> 2:36:53.360]  little corruption they only see the money they're getting the power they're
[2:36:53.360 --> 2:36:55.360]  getting they're not even thinking about how it's
[2:36:55.360 --> 2:36:59.760]  systemic how everything's going to collapse around them too
[2:37:01.120 --> 2:37:05.520]  and they're not conscious but the social engineers are
[2:37:05.520 --> 2:37:11.840]  uh austin you're on the air welcome hey alex how are you doing today good
[2:37:11.840 --> 2:37:15.360]  yeah um i actually grew up in north texas around where you did
[2:37:15.360 --> 2:37:19.680]  and um as a kid witnessed the same kind of dehumanization and all that that's
[2:37:19.680 --> 2:37:23.680]  so systemic around texas and whatnot and it was just
[2:37:23.680 --> 2:37:28.480]  really really bad really sticking to me if i ended up out here in la but um
[2:37:28.480 --> 2:37:33.120]  um it's just crazy even my friends who are 9 11 truthers out here
[2:37:33.120 --> 2:37:36.320]  um they still want to drink the kool-aid and believe that obama is going to
[2:37:36.320 --> 2:37:39.680]  fix everything and i'm getting all these text messages obama's
[2:37:39.680 --> 2:37:43.360]  you know the new savior and i just i really don't understand the disconnect
[2:37:43.360 --> 2:37:46.720]  there these educated people still um
[2:37:46.720 --> 2:37:50.160]  believing that somehow they're going to be saved but i also wanted to let you
[2:37:50.160 --> 2:37:54.400]  know about the movement and even mainstream music i'm
[2:37:54.400 --> 2:37:58.080]  not sure if you're um aware you probably are but
[2:37:58.080 --> 2:38:02.720]  curl jam and uh also smashing pumpkins are big into the 9 11 movement
[2:38:02.720 --> 2:38:08.160]  um on pearl jam second to last i had a song called inside job
[2:38:08.160 --> 2:38:12.640]  and smashing pumpkins on their um i believe latest album
[2:38:12.640 --> 2:38:16.080]  video with 11 truth in it and a lot of different things just didn't know if
[2:38:16.080 --> 2:38:21.680]  you were aware of that i am aware of that and and that's the good news
[2:38:21.680 --> 2:38:26.480]  that's the good news is that the alternative media the 9 11 truth
[2:38:26.480 --> 2:38:29.360]  movement is huge it's getting stronger every day
[2:38:29.360 --> 2:38:33.040]  but the establishment hopes to kind of with obama
[2:38:33.040 --> 2:38:36.080]  oh look everything's changed you can forget about that now and if we do
[2:38:36.080 --> 2:38:39.600]  they'll stage more terror we have taken their one of their favorite tools away
[2:38:39.600 --> 2:38:41.760]  from them now to where they know people are
[2:38:41.760 --> 2:38:44.480]  watching and listening and people understand who has the mode of the
[2:38:44.480 --> 2:38:48.320]  stage terror but the other big issue is
[2:38:48.320 --> 2:38:52.960]  people want to hope for change they want us
[2:38:52.960 --> 2:38:58.080]  you know look at the silver lining the problem is we see obama's cabinet we
[2:38:58.080 --> 2:39:02.000]  see what he said he's going to do we see the policies he's already pushing we
[2:39:02.000 --> 2:39:05.600]  know he's a new world order we know when the media start saying somebody's a
[2:39:05.600 --> 2:39:10.720]  messiah this is the media that told us iraq had wmd's and carried on 9 11
[2:39:10.720 --> 2:39:15.360]  we know we're in deep trouble now all you do is you say well let's see if we end
[2:39:15.360 --> 2:39:18.320]  the war then well let's see if they stop the torture
[2:39:18.320 --> 2:39:22.160]  well let's see if they repeal the patriot act well let's see if
[2:39:22.160 --> 2:39:26.480]  uh what he does with the bankers and this honeymoon is going to be very very
[2:39:26.480 --> 2:39:29.360]  short and so we've got to be there to hold
[2:39:29.360 --> 2:39:33.440]  just like we did with george bush barack obama's feet to the fire
[2:39:33.440 --> 2:39:36.720]  we have to be there and then just point out he's a puppet and and you know
[2:39:36.720 --> 2:39:39.920]  obviously right now there's a mass delusion going on
[2:39:39.920 --> 2:39:44.320]  uh with about 35 40 percent of the population uh we have to also now work
[2:39:44.320 --> 2:39:47.440]  on conservatives they can finally be deprogrammed
[2:39:47.440 --> 2:39:51.200]  after their experience with bush now with obama they're now ready to see the
[2:39:51.200 --> 2:39:54.800]  evil of the government because now it has a democratic
[2:39:54.800 --> 2:39:57.840]  guys so by opening the door with that then you
[2:39:57.840 --> 2:40:00.480]  could explain to them the whole paradigm and deprogram them
[2:40:00.480 --> 2:40:03.760]  just like so many leftists i know stop being leftism became
[2:40:03.760 --> 2:40:08.400]  constitutionalist freedom lovers and went out and bought guns and woke up to the
[2:40:08.400 --> 2:40:11.600]  new world order and a lot of them are awake to obama now
[2:40:11.600 --> 2:40:16.000]  so so the paradigm is shifting uh it's just that they're kind of suckering
[2:40:16.000 --> 2:40:20.480]  some folks back in with obama but that will be very very short lived because
[2:40:20.480 --> 2:40:24.560]  he said get ready for pain you know get ready for the pain
[2:40:24.560 --> 2:40:30.640]  i mean he's even said that get ready uh i saw a comment the message board
[2:40:30.640 --> 2:40:33.680]  you know what job
[2:40:35.120 --> 2:40:38.080]  what are we going to see from obama and the person said well it's what you
[2:40:38.080 --> 2:40:40.800]  would cash this clay or whatever his name is in uh
[2:40:40.800 --> 2:40:44.160]  rocky to said when they said what's going to happen with this fight and he says
[2:40:44.160 --> 2:40:48.720]  pain i mean get ready for pain get ready for a mass raping
[2:40:48.720 --> 2:40:53.920]  and the zombies will wake up pretty darn quick um
[2:40:53.920 --> 2:40:59.120]  anything else um yeah i mean i'm i'm 22 and there's
[2:40:59.120 --> 2:41:02.640]  you know being youth there's a lot that we can do i'm trying to give talks in my
[2:41:02.640 --> 2:41:06.240]  churches i have you know 56 year old people listening to me
[2:41:06.240 --> 2:41:10.960]  because of the economic crash and just being really educated in the
[2:41:10.960 --> 2:41:14.960]  historical background going back even into the 1800s really
[2:41:14.960 --> 2:41:17.680]  helps make your case and awaken these people because
[2:41:17.680 --> 2:41:21.520]  they may not listen to recent history and iraq is the fraud and all that
[2:41:21.520 --> 2:41:25.280]  but they will listen when you you have your fact straight and when you
[2:41:25.280 --> 2:41:30.800]  go over it detailed um in in a you know logical fashion yeah
[2:41:30.800 --> 2:41:34.640]  how this is all austin i appreciate your call i got to start getting some clips
[2:41:34.640 --> 2:41:38.320]  and some news i'll never covered it we'll continue with warren
[2:41:38.320 --> 2:41:44.640]  and um many others heather and others that are patiently holding
[2:41:45.200 --> 2:41:48.720]  if my voice is a little more raspy than usual i've got a sore throat today
[2:41:48.720 --> 2:41:54.480]  and uh a cough so bear with me i've been pausing a bit today
[2:41:54.480 --> 2:41:58.560]  uh i've been doing a lot of extra broadcasting let's go ahead and play
[2:41:58.560 --> 2:42:04.000]  ralph nader on fox news if you can go up to prismplanet.com and actually
[2:42:04.000 --> 2:42:06.720]  read the story that paul watson wrote about it actually
[2:42:06.720 --> 2:42:09.840]  watch the youtube video later it's it's it's even more powerful
[2:42:09.840 --> 2:42:13.280]  to see shepard smith trying to pause and act all real
[2:42:13.280 --> 2:42:19.280]  outraged and how dare you talk about about barack obama
[2:42:19.280 --> 2:42:23.440]  and this is not fox news or even ralph nader it's about
[2:42:23.440 --> 2:42:29.760]  the grandstanding the posing the the posturing uh that we see about
[2:42:29.760 --> 2:42:34.480]  oh you're saying he can either be a uncle sam or an uncle tom oh how dare you use
[2:42:34.480 --> 2:42:38.960]  that racist term that was a term used by blacks
[2:42:38.960 --> 2:42:44.560]  about black people that sell them out and see ralph nader used it but when you
[2:42:44.560 --> 2:42:47.360]  got a dumb down population doesn't know what words mean
[2:42:47.360 --> 2:42:54.800]  shepard smith just goes um oh you oh tattle tail i can't believe you said that
[2:42:54.800 --> 2:42:59.120]  and the liberal side to switch incredible nobody can say that was racist by
[2:42:59.120 --> 2:43:03.600]  by um ralph nader but it's the mind control the political correctness
[2:43:03.600 --> 2:43:07.040]  with the dumb down public doesn't know what uncle tom's cabin is
[2:43:07.040 --> 2:43:10.400]  doesn't know about that book that empowered
[2:43:10.400 --> 2:43:14.880]  and and and black people are really welcome up and a lot of whites that read
[2:43:14.880 --> 2:43:22.640]  um again it's ignorance it'd be kind of like if i said
[2:43:23.760 --> 2:43:27.680]  you know some word people didn't know what it meant
[2:43:28.800 --> 2:43:33.200]  i mean this is just so ridiculous but but but again now fox news defending
[2:43:33.200 --> 2:43:40.240]  iraq obama here it is guess who's here the independent party candidate ralph nader
[2:43:40.240 --> 2:43:44.080]  this is his second run for the presidency since he played spoiler in
[2:43:44.080 --> 2:43:48.400]  the close 2000 contest this year he's on the bat was on the ballot in 45 states
[2:43:48.400 --> 2:43:53.040]  plus dc this year he was polling about one percent ralph he spoke to fox news
[2:43:53.040 --> 2:43:57.280]  radios houston affiliate today and said this
[2:43:57.280 --> 2:44:02.560]  to put it very simply he is our first african american president or he will be
[2:44:02.560 --> 2:44:06.400]  and we wish him well but his choice basically
[2:44:06.400 --> 2:44:10.560]  is whether he's going to be uncle sam for the people of this country
[2:44:10.560 --> 2:44:17.200]  or uncle tom for the giant corporation really
[2:44:17.200 --> 2:44:23.600]  ralph nader what was that it's very simple he has um
[2:44:23.600 --> 2:44:28.240]  gone along with corporate power from the moment he entered politics in the state
[2:44:28.240 --> 2:44:31.120]  senate voted for the wall street bailout
[2:44:31.120 --> 2:44:34.880]  supports expanding military budget that is desired by
[2:44:34.880 --> 2:44:39.280]  the military industrial complex it doesn't really have a tax reform thing
[2:44:39.280 --> 2:44:42.080]  for the ordinary uh fellow in this country
[2:44:42.080 --> 2:44:45.440]  oppose a single payer full medicare for all
[2:44:45.440 --> 2:44:50.560]  because the giant hmo's at nansigno do doesn't have a living wage he's supposed
[2:44:50.560 --> 2:44:55.520]  to be uh respectful of the poor hardly mentions him in the speech so all the

[2:45:03.360 --> 2:45:07.360]  yeah that's the question he's got he's the first time in america until it came
[2:45:07.360 --> 2:45:10.880]  out of your mouth i mean i just wonder if you don't realize that you
[2:45:10.880 --> 2:45:14.080]  you know you had a number of supporters out there you were running a
[2:45:14.080 --> 2:45:17.920]  percentage this year you were reduced to irrelevant and i just wonder now if
[2:45:17.920 --> 2:45:21.760]  that's what you want your legacy to be the man who on the night that the first
[2:45:21.760 --> 2:45:25.440]  african american president in the history of this nation was elected
[2:45:25.440 --> 2:45:29.440]  you ask if he's going to be uncle sam or uncle tom
[2:45:29.440 --> 2:45:32.880]  yeah of course he's turned his back on a hundred million poor people in this
[2:45:32.880 --> 2:45:37.760]  country african americans and latinos and poor whites
[2:45:37.760 --> 2:45:41.360]  and we're gonna hold them to higher standards just not
[2:45:41.360 --> 2:45:44.960]  an unprecedented career move you don't know why else we expect more
[2:45:44.960 --> 2:45:48.480]  of barack obama you were reduced to complete your relevance here you weren't
[2:45:48.480 --> 2:45:51.680]  able to play spoiler will you run again
[2:45:51.680 --> 2:45:56.480]  look i don't like bullies like you i can't see you you can pull a plug on me
[2:45:56.480 --> 2:46:01.920]  i'm looking at a dark camera you so let's let's have i didn't say it with respect
[2:46:01.920 --> 2:46:07.680]  i did let us have i said that's the question he has to answer
[2:46:07.680 --> 2:46:11.280]  he can become a great president or he can become a toady
[2:46:11.280 --> 2:46:15.200]  for the corporate powers that have brought both parties to their knees
[2:46:15.200 --> 2:46:18.000]  against working people in this family in this country
[2:46:18.000 --> 2:46:22.000]  and have allowed our country to be hijacked by global corporations who
[2:46:22.000 --> 2:46:25.600]  have no allegiance to this country other than to ship its
[2:46:25.600 --> 2:46:29.280]  jobs and industries to fascist and communist dictators abroad
[2:46:29.280 --> 2:46:33.440]  who know how to keep their workers in their place i just reality here this is
[2:46:33.440 --> 2:46:36.480]  not show business it's not celebrity politics
[2:46:36.480 --> 2:46:40.240]  i just wonder people suffering in this country and we expect a great
[2:46:40.240 --> 2:46:44.000]  presidency from barack obama and we're going to try to hold his feet to the
[2:46:44.000 --> 2:46:46.880]  fire i just wonder if in hindsight you wish you'd
[2:46:46.880 --> 2:46:51.520]  use to phrase other than uncle town not at all
[2:46:51.520 --> 2:46:55.600]  you know what the history thanks very much yeah we'll have a response to our panel

[2:47:25.280 --> 2:47:29.520]  is a bigoted piece of trash
[2:47:30.400 --> 2:47:34.640]  because they're controlled by the establishment they are controlled by the
[2:47:34.640 --> 2:47:37.360]  moneymen they understand mob psychology they
[2:47:37.360 --> 2:47:42.000]  understand human psychology and just like for eight years seven

[2:49:05.040 --> 2:49:07.920]  they would also have to admit that they will need a retreat

[2:52:23.280 --> 2:52:25.680]  but i think in about six and a half minutes i really broke it down on
[2:52:25.680 --> 2:52:29.360]  russia today that the u.s has been seized by
[2:52:29.360 --> 2:52:33.040]  the new world order just like russia has been seized by an element of the new
[2:52:33.040 --> 2:52:38.320]  world order and um well here it is
[2:52:38.320 --> 2:52:42.080]  obama won't take over from george bush until january but the nature and policies
[2:52:42.080 --> 2:52:45.760]  of his presidency already being anticipated well join me now by phone
[2:52:45.760 --> 2:52:50.000]  from texas is political commentator and talk show host alex jones alex thanks
[2:52:50.000 --> 2:52:53.120]  very much indeed for joining us there you are a man in texas a republican state
[2:52:53.120 --> 2:52:56.320]  what are your thoughts about an obama presidency
[2:52:56.320 --> 2:52:59.920]  well first off bill thank you for having me on and thanks for russia today
[2:52:59.920 --> 2:53:04.240]  to have me on i um agree with what ralph nader was just saying
[2:53:04.240 --> 2:53:08.480]  in your piece i mean that's spot on barack obama
[2:53:08.480 --> 2:53:12.960]  got opposed to four times the political money from wall street in the big bank
[2:53:12.960 --> 2:53:16.160]  oligarchs that are looting the united states in the world right now these are
[2:53:16.160 --> 2:53:20.720]  not americans these are offshore new world order globalist
[2:53:20.720 --> 2:53:26.000]  they want a unipolar world they want to set up a world government run for and
[2:53:26.000 --> 2:53:28.640]  buy the very banks that have been looting
[2:53:28.640 --> 2:53:32.640]  not just the united states but russia and many other countries
[2:53:32.640 --> 2:53:37.680]  they also are pro-war obama has advisors that may even be more hawkish
[2:53:37.680 --> 2:53:41.360]  than george bush's neocons but he's more of a
[2:53:41.360 --> 2:53:44.880]  slick statesman so he so he'll be able to sell it better
[2:53:44.880 --> 2:53:49.840]  not the hamfisted belligerence that we've seen from george w bush so
[2:53:49.840 --> 2:53:52.640]  we're in a lot of trouble here of course i've been opposing george bush for
[2:53:52.640 --> 2:53:58.080]  almost eight years but only because he works for the very same
[2:53:58.080 --> 2:54:01.840]  institutions the very same anglo-american establishment based out of
[2:54:01.840 --> 2:54:06.960]  england and new york uh and so that's what we're facing right now is
[2:54:06.960 --> 2:54:11.280]  the candidacy of rock obama now becoming the 44th president of the united
[2:54:11.280 --> 2:54:15.840]  states and it's really a corporate pr propaganda
[2:54:15.840 --> 2:54:20.080]  coup we have had about 64 percent voter turnout so
[2:54:20.080 --> 2:54:23.760]  what close to 36 37 percent of the country voted for obama
[2:54:23.760 --> 2:54:27.840]  that's really not a huge mandate but compared to past elections
[2:54:27.840 --> 2:54:33.200]  it's larger than some now i am happy that an african-american got elected
[2:54:33.200 --> 2:54:36.960]  that's a great hurdle for us and some of our history here in the united states
[2:54:36.960 --> 2:54:40.400]  and that's the only silver lining here other than that
[2:54:40.400 --> 2:54:45.360]  rock obama is a corporate stooge controlled by these robber barons
[2:54:45.360 --> 2:54:48.640]  that are looting the united states and unfortunately
[2:54:48.640 --> 2:54:53.840]  he has more of a anti-russian stance than even george bush has
[2:54:53.840 --> 2:54:58.000]  he's advised by the big new rosinski to help stage
[2:54:58.000 --> 2:55:03.120]  the attacks on russian forces in 1979 to precipitate bringing them into
[2:55:03.120 --> 2:55:07.520]  afghanistan even bragging a book he published last year about that and so
[2:55:07.520 --> 2:55:11.680]  because i love my country and i love my family and i am a
[2:55:11.680 --> 2:55:15.680]  total patriot to the united states i don't like these internationalists
[2:55:15.680 --> 2:55:19.840]  coming in here taking control of my country and using it as a tool
[2:55:19.840 --> 2:55:25.840]  to bully other nations especially nations that can't be bullied like russia
[2:55:25.840 --> 2:55:30.160]  it is because i am loyal to the united states that i don't want to start
[2:55:30.160 --> 2:55:34.960]  conflicts with these proxy states like ukraine and georgia
[2:55:34.960 --> 2:55:38.640]  with the sneak attacks they've been trying to stage against russia so that's
[2:55:38.640 --> 2:55:41.600]  another reason uh... that we're very very upset here in the united
[2:55:41.600 --> 2:55:44.960]  states people that are rational thinkers true conservatives that support
[2:55:44.960 --> 2:55:48.960]  people like congressman ron paul and so i would love to think we're having
[2:55:48.960 --> 2:55:51.520]  change i would love to think everything was okay now
[2:55:51.520 --> 2:55:55.440]  but we know it's not what's gonna happen is alex you you just mentioned that

[2:58:18.480 --> 2:58:22.240]  very easy to install literally a handyman can do it for
[2:58:22.240 --> 2:58:26.160]  probably fifty bucks and i have no real skills
[2:58:26.160 --> 2:58:30.400]  uh... with uh... water lines and things and i can do this
[2:58:30.400 --> 2:58:34.800]  it's basically inexpensive high-powered filters
[2:58:34.800 --> 2:58:37.360]  they call them reduction elements because it reduces everything down to like
[2:58:37.360 --> 2:58:40.640]  ninety nine point nine percent
[2:58:40.640 --> 2:58:45.120]  and uh... it's all the poisons the mercury the arsenic the fluoride it
[2:58:45.120 --> 2:58:48.640]  it it cuts it down to basically non-existent levels
[2:58:48.640 --> 2:58:51.920]  and it just does it through the water supply because a lot of disease causing
[2:58:51.920 --> 2:58:56.080]  contaminants but see a contaminant means that it got their own accident they
[2:58:56.080 --> 2:58:59.040]  put it in their own purpose are present in
[2:58:59.040 --> 2:59:02.320]  all your major water supplies that are city or county
[2:59:02.320 --> 2:59:05.760]  they enter your bodies primarily through the skin absorption inhalation
[2:59:05.760 --> 2:59:09.200]  we bathe or shower rather than by drinking the water and so i looked into a
[2:59:09.200 --> 2:59:11.840]  bunch of systems they got ten twenty thirty thousand
[2:59:11.840 --> 2:59:14.800]  dollar systems you know and they can't even guarantee those
[2:59:14.800 --> 2:59:17.680]  these smaller systems are better you just replace them every year and they're
[2:59:17.680 --> 2:59:22.320]  not expensive at all so go to healthy waterman dot com

[2:59:54.400 --> 2:59:56.240]  up with russia today
[2:59:56.240 --> 2:59:59.680]  Alex you you just mentioned that word change the whole american population
[2:59:59.680 --> 3:00:02.480]  has been promised a change by abama do you think
[3:00:02.480 --> 3:00:07.280]  that by the very nature a record turnout uh... many many people turned out
[3:00:07.280 --> 3:00:10.000]  hadn't voted before there was a unprecedented
[3:00:10.000 --> 3:00:13.440]  turnout in the election they still voted for abama and you're saying that that
[3:00:13.440 --> 3:00:16.320]  population was duped there will be no change and very little difference to
[3:00:16.320 --> 3:00:18.080]  what we've seen in the last administration
[3:00:18.080 --> 3:00:21.920]  oh there will be change but only for the worse they are going to accelerate
[3:00:21.920 --> 3:00:25.120]  the corporate looting barack obama a month ago
[3:00:25.120 --> 3:00:29.280]  the congress would not pass the bank or takeover bill it wasn't a bailout it
[3:00:29.280 --> 3:00:32.320]  gave them governmental power they've already stolen trillions not eight
[3:00:32.320 --> 3:00:36.400]  hundred fifty billion and so as soon as barack obama
[3:00:36.400 --> 3:00:40.720]  you know came in he is already talking about more bailouts for the banks but a
[3:00:40.720 --> 3:00:43.440]  month ago when we were close to defeating it
[3:00:43.440 --> 3:00:47.200]  and 98 percent of americans in polls were against it barack obama got on
[3:00:47.200 --> 3:00:50.560]  national tv he called the congress he said we must
[3:00:50.560 --> 3:00:55.280]  pass this and he criticized john mccain for not being enthusiastic enough so
[3:00:55.280 --> 3:00:58.960]  yes we're going to get changed did you know he wants a million person
[3:00:58.960 --> 3:01:03.680]  east german style stasi or an nkvd
[3:01:03.680 --> 3:01:07.760]  literally to spy on the american people he's on video saying
[3:01:07.760 --> 3:01:11.440]  he's going to have a million armed youth brigade
[3:01:11.440 --> 3:01:14.560]  spying on americans that are against what he's doing so yes
[3:01:14.560 --> 3:01:19.200]  we're getting changed our media is calling him some messianic savior
[3:01:19.200 --> 3:01:23.680]  president of the world of the war and that sounds like hitler that
[3:01:23.680 --> 3:01:26.880]  okay alex so we haven't got a lot of time but let's get this in context the
[3:01:26.880 --> 3:01:30.240]  fact that i'm in russia you're in the states we're both talking to each other
[3:01:30.240 --> 3:01:33.680]  and here we have a situation where you were saying a little earlier that
[3:01:33.680 --> 3:01:37.840]  he stands against russia will not be a lot different from george bush and yet
[3:01:37.840 --> 3:01:41.120]  there are many pundits here russia who are welcoming the fact that obama is
[3:01:41.120 --> 3:01:44.960]  in power rather than mccain it's a lot better the fact that he's there and not
[3:01:44.960 --> 3:01:49.840]  mccain yes well look look they're trying to be congenial russia wants to sell
[3:01:49.840 --> 3:01:53.520]  oil and gas wants to sell their technologies i mean i'm just
[3:01:53.520 --> 3:01:57.600]  being honest here russia is being reasonable and hoping and trying as
[3:01:57.600 --> 3:02:02.080]  they've done with bush for eight years to be friends to be reasonable to ask
[3:02:02.080 --> 3:02:06.880]  nato to stop encircling them so yes russia is hoping by day time
[3:02:06.880 --> 3:02:10.320]  they can back up off you've got a problem in rock obama and russia
[3:02:10.320 --> 3:02:14.560]  we have it here too he's going to be slicker he's going to be able to sell
[3:02:14.560 --> 3:02:18.480]  the encirclement of russia in a new cold war all right we'll be right back you can
[3:02:18.480 --> 3:02:24.240]  watch the rest of it at prisonplanet.com stay with us
[3:02:24.240 --> 3:02:27.920]  hello friends this is alex jones i've told you for a long time it's important
[3:02:27.920 --> 3:02:30.720]  to be self-sufficient and today that's more important than ever
[3:02:30.720 --> 3:02:34.320]  we need to be independent and food and water is the key you'll never have to
[3:02:34.320 --> 3:02:36.720]  stand in a bread line if you have your own bread
[3:02:36.720 --> 3:02:40.080]  you'll never have to go to the super dome and beg for fema to take care of your
[3:02:40.080 --> 3:02:42.960]  family in any emergency if you simply prepare our
[3:02:42.960 --> 3:02:46.080]  elected representatives wanted a good old boy bailout for the special
[3:02:46.080 --> 3:02:48.640]  interest so they ignored your screams not to do it
[3:02:48.640 --> 3:02:51.440]  they turned off the telephones and email they voted to print
[3:02:51.440 --> 3:02:55.280]  eight hundred and fifty billion dollars at least out of thin air this money now
[3:02:55.280 --> 3:02:59.040]  owns the america and european banks the exploding inflation that is now
[3:02:59.040 --> 3:03:02.720]  guaranteed will slash your life savings to nothing and blast the cost of
[3:03:02.720 --> 3:03:07.120]  necessities particularly food beyond many americans reach in pre-nazi
[3:03:07.120 --> 3:03:10.240]  germany super inflation the cost of a loaf of bread doubled
[3:03:10.240 --> 3:03:13.520]  every two days until it reached over four billion marks
[3:03:13.520 --> 3:03:17.360]  food prices are skyrocketing so fast there seems as if there may be no end
[3:03:17.360 --> 3:03:20.320]  in sight the private banks merging with our government
[3:03:20.320 --> 3:03:23.600]  are refusing to loan grocery stores enough money to restock their shelves
[3:03:23.600 --> 3:03:26.880]  the stores have less food but jack of prices to stay in business
[3:03:26.880 --> 3:03:30.240]  whatever happens in america we need to be prepared and be ready
[3:03:30.240 --> 3:03:33.840]  everything is zeroing in on food one third of americans have to choose between
[3:03:33.840 --> 3:03:36.160]  buying food and paying for other necessities
[3:03:36.160 --> 3:03:40.240]  my friends whatever it takes get prepared get self-sufficient get food
[3:03:40.240 --> 3:03:43.120]  for everybody out there listening it's very important for you to understand
[3:03:43.120 --> 3:03:46.400]  that by having a supply of storable food the government the new old order has a
[3:03:46.400 --> 3:03:49.760]  lot less control over you and so it's a mindset a mindset of
[3:03:49.760 --> 3:03:53.360]  self-sufficiency and preparedness no one is going to take care of your family
[3:03:53.360 --> 3:03:56.960]  in the final equation but you you know efoodsdirect.com is still able

[3:05:09.360 --> 3:05:13.440]  i've been trying to stock up on gold and
[3:05:13.440 --> 3:05:18.080]  uh... actually my sister and my parents are both buying those solar
[3:05:18.080 --> 3:05:22.880]  generators but uh... i guess what i want to talk to you
[3:05:22.880 --> 3:05:24.240]  about
[3:05:24.240 --> 3:05:28.640]  uh... is a thing that i found in my backyard
[3:05:28.640 --> 3:05:34.320]  uh... so to speak uh... we live in a small town in northern michigan
[3:05:34.320 --> 3:05:38.560]  and uh... a company just moved in here
[3:05:38.560 --> 3:05:42.800]  uh... about fifteen miles away called sovereign deed
[3:05:42.800 --> 3:05:45.840]  have you ever heard of them no i haven't
[3:05:45.840 --> 3:05:51.360]  uh... what it is is it's a company that
[3:05:51.360 --> 3:05:55.680]  if you've got the money uh... they send you
[3:05:55.680 --> 3:06:00.080]  a package and in that package uh... depending on
[3:06:00.080 --> 3:06:04.880]  whether you want a briefcase size or for three days or
[3:06:04.880 --> 3:06:08.800]  a uh... rolling crate size
[3:06:08.800 --> 3:06:13.600]  uh... for fourteen days uh...
[3:06:13.600 --> 3:06:18.480]  you basically pay them fifty to seventy five thousand dollars plus a ten
[3:06:18.480 --> 3:06:22.800]  thousand dollar a year maintenance fee what is it
[3:06:22.800 --> 3:06:25.920]  uh... it's in case there's a
[3:06:25.920 --> 3:06:30.400]  disaster in a major city or um...
[3:06:30.400 --> 3:06:34.640]  anywhere in the welser uh... you know i wouldn't count
[3:06:34.640 --> 3:06:37.840]  personally my shelf on on a company that's going to save you during an
[3:06:37.840 --> 3:06:40.720]  emergency i would take care of yourself
[3:06:40.720 --> 3:06:45.760]  uh... the government isn't going to save you during an emergency i'll
[3:06:45.760 --> 3:06:50.480]  guarantee you that nine times out of ten
[3:06:50.480 --> 3:06:54.320]  and certainly uh...
[3:06:54.320 --> 3:06:56.880]  you probably can't count on your neighbors or even in some cases your
[3:06:56.880 --> 3:07:00.480]  family you got to take care of yourself and your children
[3:07:00.480 --> 3:07:04.720]  and uh...
[3:07:04.720 --> 3:07:09.680]  i don't even matter whatever how heather in texas you're on the air welcome
[3:07:09.680 --> 3:07:13.120]  did you say that yes i did hey alex are you doing
[3:07:13.120 --> 3:07:17.600]  fine thank you um i'm kind of not to ask a question i'm sorry you hear a lot of
[3:07:17.600 --> 3:07:21.360]  these people that are uh... i guess they choose their ignorance is the best way
[3:07:21.360 --> 3:07:25.440]  to say uh... we a friend of mine christa and i we have a youtube show
[3:07:25.440 --> 3:07:28.880]  called abstractive fascism and it's our way to get out there and try to do what
[3:07:28.880 --> 3:07:31.840]  you're doing is at a small local level here in west texas
[3:07:31.840 --> 3:07:35.840]  good and um we've had perfecting episodes we go over the same thing you do
[3:07:35.840 --> 3:07:39.040]  you know bernay's and i just don't i mean i go to the bar every night i don't
[3:07:39.040 --> 3:07:42.160]  have any kids or any kind of responsibility um
[3:07:42.160 --> 3:07:46.320]  besides working all that but i i try to tell people and they tell me that
[3:07:46.320 --> 3:07:50.000]  patriot act is it's not for you know it's for terrorists it's not for citizens
[3:07:50.000 --> 3:07:52.640]  they they don't wake up they don't wake up but
[3:07:52.640 --> 3:07:56.800]  my whole point in what i'd like to remind your audience is that as evil
[3:07:56.800 --> 3:08:00.480]  as these people are they're the light that's brighter
[3:08:00.480 --> 3:08:04.160]  and it's the only thing that we have because
[3:08:04.160 --> 3:08:07.280]  are you still there yeah somebody's calling you you want to take that call
[3:08:07.280 --> 3:08:10.720]  oh no of course not okay but i just went on record we're not censoring you
[3:08:10.720 --> 3:08:14.400]  listeners will think that uh... but you but you're getting another call so it's
[3:08:14.400 --> 3:08:17.280]  going to probably blip out in in just a second again
[3:08:17.280 --> 3:08:21.520]  uh... so i just want to wait for that to happen and then we can continue
[3:08:21.520 --> 3:08:25.520]  uh... but i mean if you fight fire it's fire they have bigger guns they have
[3:08:25.520 --> 3:08:29.040]  all these technologies that i mean i i went to school month cruises to an MSU
[3:08:29.040 --> 3:08:31.840]  and when i first got down there i saw the chemtrails because white sand is
[3:08:31.840 --> 3:08:35.120]  right there and i this is before they disclose that that they were going to
[3:08:35.120 --> 3:08:38.560]  do the chemtrails to you know do global gaming to put the you know
[3:08:38.560 --> 3:08:42.160]  pulverized particles in the sky and even though they've admitted they're
[3:08:42.160 --> 3:08:44.560]  doing it the public doesn't believe it
[3:08:44.560 --> 3:08:47.840]  when i was nineteen and i went to an MSU i didn't know this and i looked up at
[3:08:47.840 --> 3:08:50.720]  the sky and i saw that now it's like i bet you wish didn't lie
[3:08:50.720 --> 3:08:52.960]  when you said he was going to do something about global warming
[3:08:52.960 --> 3:08:56.000]  i bet you anything and then it comes comes out that i was right and so were
[3:08:56.000 --> 3:08:59.120]  you and so was everybody else and it's a good thing because
[3:08:59.120 --> 3:09:02.720]  there's like a wavelength that the people that are awake they know they know
[3:09:02.720 --> 3:09:05.360]  what's there and we know what's there and we know what they're doing
[3:09:05.360 --> 3:09:11.200]  and yeah they have us by our you know whatever you want to call it
[3:09:11.200 --> 3:09:14.560]  right now but it's it's it's a if you want to get biblical with it i'm not
[3:09:14.560 --> 3:09:18.320]  really religious and spiritual but i just i'm scared
[3:09:18.320 --> 3:09:21.280]  today i know and i know these people tell you to calm down and it's like how do
[3:09:21.280 --> 3:09:23.440]  you calm down when there's a loaded gun to your head
[3:09:23.440 --> 3:09:27.760]  well number one number one you go back to those people and you say
[3:09:27.760 --> 3:09:31.440]  i know you think it's tough or manly to not care about reality and to not care
[3:09:31.440 --> 3:09:34.720]  about your country but it but you bring them the you know
[3:09:34.720 --> 3:09:38.080]  google and then bring them mainline articles i mean i would do it and you
[3:09:38.080 --> 3:09:41.040]  know it's thousands and thousands of pages of documents and you can show them
[3:09:41.040 --> 3:09:43.600]  now but they've got to be patient enough to listen and they're not
[3:09:43.600 --> 3:09:47.920]  and and well hold on just a second just on the subject of the patriot act only
[3:09:47.920 --> 3:09:51.680]  being for l c i a to um
[3:09:51.680 --> 3:09:54.560]  they used the patriot act on a prison guard
[3:09:54.560 --> 3:09:59.520]  ordered to torture people to death uh... in afghanistan and even came out in the
[3:09:59.520 --> 3:10:02.960]  news to muzzle him because he was going to use it in his defense that he was
[3:10:02.960 --> 3:10:06.400]  ordered to torture from the white house which later came out
[3:10:06.400 --> 3:10:10.640]  and they said no patriot actor terrorist you're not allowed to have free speech
[3:10:10.640 --> 3:10:16.240]  or have a public trial so you can bring the mainstream news articles
[3:10:16.240 --> 3:10:21.760]  where you know headline uh... patriot act used uh... in thousands of non-terror
[3:10:21.760 --> 3:10:25.600]  cases in tennessee or in georgia
[3:10:25.600 --> 3:10:28.480]  i mean i mean every state has had the same headline
[3:10:28.480 --> 3:10:32.320]  they're using it against everybody it has nothing to do with terror
[3:10:32.320 --> 3:10:36.080]  but if you're a real lasetas terrorist murdering police in south texas
[3:10:36.080 --> 3:10:40.240]  nothing's done to you this is all for us the cattle
[3:10:40.240 --> 3:10:43.200]  because the system has to promise its criminals
[3:10:43.200 --> 3:10:46.960]  more houses more money more cash so
[3:10:46.960 --> 3:10:49.680]  that's what happens when a caesar takes over a roam
[3:10:49.680 --> 3:10:55.040]  he gives his praetorian goods and they would always squeeze
[3:10:55.040 --> 3:10:58.480]  uh... the uh... middle class but but
[3:10:58.480 --> 3:11:01.280]  go ahead heather
[3:11:01.280 --> 3:11:04.000]  they'd like oh you're just a conspiracy theorist and i'm like well what was

[3:11:11.360 --> 3:11:15.040]  that want to sit around and suck their thumbs and and and laugh at you heather
[3:11:15.040 --> 3:11:17.760]  i would move on and find people and there are plenty of them
[3:11:17.760 --> 3:11:21.280]  that are awake here in less texas there's not as many as there are in austin
[3:11:21.280 --> 3:11:24.720]  and there's a few of us but there's not as many well those people are dead
[3:11:24.720 --> 3:11:28.800]  they're fake texas they're all hat and no cattle
[3:11:28.800 --> 3:11:33.360]  uh... they watch their football they act tough they drive around in big trucks
[3:11:33.360 --> 3:11:37.440]  with marine corps stickers on their cars they hate america their pieces of
[3:11:37.440 --> 3:11:42.000]  trash their cowards they're not real texas they're not real americans
[3:11:42.000 --> 3:11:45.920]  they've got their big hat no cattle feeling good

[3:11:50.880 --> 3:11:55.120]  and then we can't forget and when people tell you not to freak out i mean tell
[3:11:55.120 --> 3:11:57.360]  them you know you're freaking out because you're trying to wake these people up
[3:11:57.360 --> 3:11:59.280]  and we know that your listeners do know this
[3:11:59.280 --> 3:12:02.720]  and um we definitely we do have blood on our side we are connected we are
[3:12:02.720 --> 3:12:05.120]  connected as connected as they are well it's like you said you're trying to
[3:12:05.120 --> 3:12:08.240]  wake folks up at bars though they're there for escape
[3:12:08.240 --> 3:12:11.520]  there's nothing to do but you can't no i understand but i mean they're there
[3:12:11.520 --> 3:12:16.400]  they're there heather to pick you up oh yeah they're not there to hear about it
[3:12:16.400 --> 3:12:19.280]  you know uh these aren't people of responsibility
[3:12:19.280 --> 3:12:24.080]  they're all they are is acting cool they wear a cowboy hat they wear a ball cap
[3:12:24.080 --> 3:12:27.280]  they stick their they stick their chest out and walk around going
[3:12:27.280 --> 3:12:31.760]  yeah and and to them that's their whole world just yeah
[3:12:31.760 --> 3:12:36.160]  so i mean you know how can they ever change or do they have no self respect
[3:12:36.160 --> 3:12:39.760]  for themselves too they can't imagine themselves facing down a corrupt
[3:12:39.760 --> 3:12:43.280]  government they're scared when a cop pulls these tough guys over
[3:12:43.280 --> 3:12:47.680]  they that you know that they cower you know they're cowards they're unamerican
[3:12:47.680 --> 3:12:51.360]  filth and so and so and so they don't respect
[3:12:51.360 --> 3:12:55.440]  themselves enough to go to city council or educate themselves or find out what's
[3:12:55.440 --> 3:12:58.240]  happening they just are cowards who want to
[3:12:58.240 --> 3:13:03.200]  believe everything's okay and so don't worry they're going to get hurt real bad
[3:13:03.200 --> 3:13:05.920]  i don't know if i can believe in the whole fighting fire with fire thing
[3:13:05.920 --> 3:13:09.520]  because to me i i when i was in um last truth is i also
[3:13:09.520 --> 3:13:12.720]  got to see the howlburton um terrorist containment cell that they're building
[3:13:12.720 --> 3:13:15.920]  on the airbase out there and i got to drive through the loop um in east
[3:13:15.920 --> 3:13:20.480]  montana uh or what excuse me right before montana exits in El Paso
[3:13:20.480 --> 3:13:23.440]  and you look to the right and there's this it's got to be like five square
[3:13:23.440 --> 3:13:26.560]  miles and i saw him bring the plumbing in i saw the trains come in at one
[3:13:26.560 --> 3:13:29.440]  o'clock in the morning they had no i mean you know how you see graffiti on
[3:13:29.440 --> 3:13:32.240]  trains i mean they did it this all at night they brought in everything in
[3:13:32.240 --> 3:13:36.000]  trains at night and um you can go to El Paso's website and the
[3:13:36.000 --> 3:13:38.960]  howlburton's and they'll say what they're doing it's open it's right out
[3:13:38.960 --> 3:13:42.720]  in the open and it's supposed to hold like 250,000 people i know and then it
[3:13:42.720 --> 3:13:46.560]  could be in the houston chronicle and the public says ain't real
[3:13:46.560 --> 3:13:50.480]  hey the banker's taking all your money's real now when everybody out there the
[3:13:50.480 --> 3:13:53.920]  raping you're getting is real heather i appreciate your story you know what
[3:13:53.920 --> 3:13:57.840]  you ought to do is videotape that El Paso FEMA camp
[3:13:57.840 --> 3:14:01.280]  and then show everybody just keep doing what you're doing and and you've got
[3:14:01.280 --> 3:14:04.560]  the spirit you're fired up you're upset that's what it's going to take to
[3:14:04.560 --> 3:14:09.120]  reach out to people so god bless you but yeah no i know west texas is just a
[3:14:09.120 --> 3:14:12.240]  ghost yard of mindless phony conservatism
[3:14:12.240 --> 3:14:15.840]  just like a lot of inner cities or ghost towns mentally of mindless obama
[3:14:15.840 --> 3:14:19.200]  worshipers uh let's talk to robert in california you're on the
[3:14:19.200 --> 3:14:23.680]  air robert and joe down and others how you doing alec good got about a minute and a half
[3:14:23.680 --> 3:14:28.240]  okay uh first of all um i actually ran for the central committee
[3:14:28.240 --> 3:14:33.200]  and um um area down in l.a and we got elected and there's plenty of us and
[3:14:33.200 --> 3:14:36.400]  that's one of the things that people can do is actually run for their their
[3:14:36.400 --> 3:14:41.040]  central committees and their bases and city councils and things like that
[3:14:41.040 --> 3:14:45.440]  and hopefully this year we have enough votes actually take it back and bring
[3:14:45.440 --> 3:14:49.760]  some sanity back into our voting system least in this in this little part of
[3:14:49.760 --> 3:14:52.800]  the country i agree and there is a certain
[3:14:52.800 --> 3:14:56.240]  you know uh covertness to all this you need to decide whether you're going to
[3:14:56.240 --> 3:14:59.520]  be a public fighter of the new world order or if you're going to be a covert
[3:14:59.520 --> 3:15:02.400]  fighter and we need them all we're going into very dark times we're going to
[3:15:02.400 --> 3:15:05.760]  have you know we're in the system this is going to get you know really serious
[3:15:05.760 --> 3:15:09.760]  we need people to play like they're even with the system
[3:15:09.760 --> 3:15:13.840]  to be there at every level of government spying on the enemy operations spying
[3:15:13.840 --> 3:15:18.000]  on the hijackers uh the coup d'etat the foreign banking group that's coming and
[3:15:18.000 --> 3:15:21.120]  taking over they are traders they are enemies they are enemy operatives
[3:15:21.120 --> 3:15:25.440]  they're enemy combatants literally and so we need people to choose their path
[3:15:25.440 --> 3:15:30.160]  public info war or infiltration of enemy operations
[3:15:30.160 --> 3:15:34.800]  uh go ahead and finish up i think we can do a little bit of both too you know you
[3:15:34.800 --> 3:15:37.600]  can actually play nice and get people like you but
[3:15:37.600 --> 3:15:40.640]  you know it's also a thing about losing your fear
[3:15:40.640 --> 3:15:44.240]  and knowing that you have power within yourself so yeah a lot of people are
[3:15:44.240 --> 3:15:47.200]  scared and timid like i know this sounds kooky but here's a free dvd
[3:15:47.200 --> 3:15:50.480]  no you're like hey serious stuff's going on this is a really hot video you need
[3:15:50.480 --> 3:15:52.400]  to check it out tell me what you think about it
[3:15:52.400 --> 3:15:55.360]  you got to be confident i stay there i'm let you finish up we get to
[3:15:55.360 --> 3:15:59.440]  lukradowski i appreciate you coming in we'll be right back stay with us
[3:15:59.440 --> 3:16:02.560]  jim newcomb let me just skip this break john number six
[3:16:02.560 --> 3:16:06.480]  you're at prison planet dot tv you got luke on the line
[3:16:06.480 --> 3:16:10.160]  it's ringing let me just go ahead and go back to
[3:16:10.160 --> 3:16:14.240]  to um robert so at least the internet audience can hear him finish up since i
[3:16:14.240 --> 3:16:17.360]  cut him off robert go ahead and tell the listeners
[3:16:17.360 --> 3:16:21.920]  uh yeah i mean obviously you can go in there and and and act friendly and
[3:16:21.920 --> 3:16:24.800]  and not scare him too much and it's how you announce it
[3:16:24.800 --> 3:16:27.520]  you know i mean you can take the smooth approach you can take the in their
[3:16:27.520 --> 3:16:31.440]  face approach different things work uh or i'm saying we
[3:16:31.440 --> 3:16:36.000]  also need to realize we're going into very dark times and down the road uh
[3:16:36.000 --> 3:16:39.600]  you know we got people everywhere and who are we people that love liberty people
[3:16:39.600 --> 3:16:43.440]  that love freedom now known as terrorist anything else
[3:16:43.440 --> 3:16:48.000]  uh yeah and you're right on that point and and it's basically not necessarily
[3:16:48.000 --> 3:16:51.360]  getting in their face because a lot of people have been brainwashed a little
[3:16:51.360 --> 3:16:55.440]  bit about washing their brain clean it's like reverse brainwashing you know i
[3:16:55.440 --> 3:16:57.600]  had a brother tell me one time you know i had a
[3:16:57.600 --> 3:17:01.440]  head full of stuff and he says you know and i and i said well you know i'm
[3:17:01.440 --> 3:17:04.320]  bringing all the stuff you know the new stuff to my people and they're saying
[3:17:04.320 --> 3:17:07.680]  oh you're getting brainwashed he says yeah your brain is being washed clean
[3:17:07.680 --> 3:17:12.880]  it's getting all the the the muck that's in from this world likes to put into it
[3:17:12.880 --> 3:17:16.400]  it's sort of like you said with the thing about the the rapture you know
[3:17:16.400 --> 3:17:19.440]  everybody's waiting around christians are waiting for the rapture
[3:17:19.440 --> 3:17:23.200]  when the bible doesn't even speak about that it speaks about a change in of who
[3:17:23.200 --> 3:17:26.800]  we are not a change of our geographical location
[3:17:26.800 --> 3:17:30.880]  so and that's where it's all gonna start we have to start from a change with
[3:17:30.880 --> 3:17:35.360]  within us well regardless look at the fruit of the phony christian movement
[3:17:35.360 --> 3:17:39.040]  saying rejoice that horrible things are happening that means jesus is almost here
[3:17:39.040 --> 3:17:42.720]  regardless you have a responsibility to fight evil to warn people
[3:17:42.720 --> 3:17:46.800]  to say no to all this but as the microchip comes in as the thumb scanners
[3:17:46.800 --> 3:17:50.000]  go in the grocery stores it's all happening
[3:17:50.000 --> 3:17:53.680]  uh as the troops march around in black uniforms they're going oh it's out the
[3:17:53.680 --> 3:18:00.640]  lord to find out cad yeah absolutely i mean it's disgusting filth
[3:18:00.640 --> 3:18:04.480]  absolutely but we also know that all things work for good to those who love
[3:18:04.480 --> 3:18:07.440]  god and even what like you said with this
[3:18:07.440 --> 3:18:11.120]  left right paradigm it's going to be shattered we know that when the things
[3:18:11.120 --> 3:18:14.720]  are bad that people begin to wake up and say hey you know i need to do something
[3:18:14.720 --> 3:18:19.680]  and stand up prayers are just not words that we send in into our empty closet
[3:18:19.680 --> 3:18:23.360]  also has to take feet and action to those prayers
[3:18:23.360 --> 3:18:27.120]  yeah but then the phony baptist and stuff say no it's it's grace alone
[3:18:27.120 --> 3:18:30.960]  obviously but once you have grace you're going to show the fruit
[3:18:30.960 --> 3:18:37.680]  or you aren't really saved right and then they'll argue and go no no no
[3:18:37.680 --> 3:18:42.800]  and then i like torture it's of the lord and then my rackies ain't human beings
[3:18:42.800 --> 3:18:47.040]  they're seed of the devil and all i love the millions of them are dead it's of
[3:18:47.040 --> 3:18:50.320]  the lord well it's like when i told my friend you
[3:18:50.320 --> 3:18:53.680]  know jesus says you know sell your other coat and buy a sword
[3:18:53.680 --> 3:18:57.600]  and he looked at me and what do you mean no no robert 13
[3:18:57.600 --> 3:19:01.920]  lay down give them go to the femur camp it's of the lord
[3:19:01.920 --> 3:19:06.320]  and having our police and our fed secretly paying the preachers to prepare
[3:19:06.320 --> 3:19:11.200]  us to go to camps that's freedom that's what america's all about
[3:19:11.200 --> 3:19:15.360]  it's wonderful we're gonna find out
[3:19:15.360 --> 3:19:19.680]  yeah and that's what all governors throughout the world have always had an
[3:19:19.680 --> 3:19:24.160]  enemy to force the fight and not really you know first deal with a battle
[3:19:24.160 --> 3:19:27.440]  that's within us and then deal with a battle that's what it sounds like
[3:19:27.440 --> 3:19:31.200]  to me sounds like you're a kgb kami
[3:19:31.200 --> 3:19:37.360]  sounds like you're an infiltrator sounds like you don't love the lord
[3:19:37.360 --> 3:19:42.400]  we're gonna put you in a work camp boy that'll teach you to love the lord
[3:19:42.400 --> 3:19:45.440]  appreciate your call in all right have a good day good to hear from you we're

[3:21:33.200 --> 3:21:36.720]  they pushed me in the corner and they do not let me leave until bloomberg
[3:21:36.720 --> 3:21:40.880]  leaves the damn area and they came up to me and they already knew my name
[3:21:40.880 --> 3:21:43.920]  i already told them how in the world do you know my name
[3:21:43.920 --> 3:21:47.120]  and they're like yeah we've been following you and your organization
[3:21:47.120 --> 3:21:51.280]  and uh bloomberg not taking any questions and i'm like am i being detained
[3:21:51.280 --> 3:21:55.360]  and they said no and they wouldn't let me leave and they and they basically
[3:21:55.360 --> 3:21:58.800]  they were playing like they're they were just blocking me up every time i try to
[3:21:58.800 --> 3:22:03.040]  walk away they were just corner me in and just then just but me and not let me
[3:22:03.040 --> 3:22:07.360]  move anywhere that same day that's intimidation so they didn't intimidate
[3:22:07.360 --> 3:22:11.120]  so you don't keep asking the mayor about getting health care for the firemen and
[3:22:11.120 --> 3:22:15.200]  police exactly they already know my name they already know who i am that same
[3:22:15.200 --> 3:22:18.400]  day i got really pissed off that they violated my rights this way
[3:22:18.400 --> 3:22:22.400]  that same day i confronted the mayor seven p.m in manhattan
[3:22:22.400 --> 3:22:26.640]  uh and i luckily got through security i got there just as bloomberg was leaving
[3:22:26.640 --> 3:22:29.520]  i got right in his face and i was like how come you're not supporting the
[3:22:29.520 --> 3:22:32.560]  not 11 first responders how dare you say that the james
[3:22:32.560 --> 3:22:36.720]  the drogo bill is an undue tax burden and he ran off and his security guards
[3:22:36.720 --> 3:22:40.000]  pushed me off and an incredible thing is happening in the city where we
[3:22:40.000 --> 3:22:43.680]  confronted mayor bloomberg three times in one week
[3:22:43.680 --> 3:22:47.280]  me brian kenny man now they and now they've contacted you and said we'll give
[3:22:47.280 --> 3:22:51.600]  you a meeting with the mayor that shows they hate seeing the humans they hate
[3:22:51.600 --> 3:22:54.560]  hearing you oh you're you're you're asking the mayor questions you're a
[3:22:54.560 --> 3:22:58.480]  terrorist and you caught the cops trying to say you had bombs they got in
[3:22:58.480 --> 3:23:01.760]  trouble you are the terrorist and we're going to expose you
[3:23:01.760 --> 3:23:04.960]  but we're trying to make things work and they told us look whatever you do we'll
[3:23:04.960 --> 3:23:07.680]  do whatever you want just stop confronting the mayor we don't have a
[3:23:07.680 --> 3:23:10.480]  meeting with the mayor we have a meeting with the mayor secretary
[3:23:10.480 --> 3:23:14.320]  and city hall yeah i was told wrong i was told wrong but my office last night
[3:23:14.320 --> 3:23:17.920]  they told me to give you the meeting you're having a meeting with the mayor
[3:23:17.920 --> 3:23:21.360]  now we're having a mayor we're having a meeting with the mayor's secretary
[3:23:21.360 --> 3:23:25.040]  and a spokesperson in order to help out first responders and we're doing this
[3:23:25.040 --> 3:23:28.080]  with other first responders are going to be with us this friday and we're going
[3:23:28.080 --> 3:23:32.480]  to try as best as we can to get the city and persuade the city to help out the
[3:23:32.480 --> 3:23:36.320]  dying heroes here in new york city and it's really a dire situation
[3:23:36.320 --> 3:23:39.440]  that the first responders are going through the james the drogo bill was
[3:23:39.440 --> 3:23:42.800]  not passed by congress because of bloomberg's opposition to it he said it
[3:23:42.800 --> 3:23:45.680]  was an undue tax burden and an unfair bill
[3:23:45.680 --> 3:23:48.480]  but he doesn't really understand that if it were to pass through congress the
[3:23:48.480 --> 3:23:51.840]  senate would have negotiated those well look the military is not being given
[3:23:51.840 --> 3:23:56.800]  the health care and uh... that's how it works your trash them cops firemen police
[3:23:56.800 --> 3:24:00.880]  you are garbage you are garbage nobody wants to help
[3:24:00.880 --> 3:24:04.560]  the people who serve this country and that you are garbage let me finish
[3:24:04.560 --> 3:24:07.840]  because it could be taken on you are garbage to the new world order
[3:24:07.840 --> 3:24:10.400]  uh... they only want you to wrap yourself in the flag and
[3:24:10.400 --> 3:24:14.240]  and and and be fooled by them they hate your guts go ahead look exactly that's
[3:24:14.240 --> 3:24:17.280]  why they disrespect the police and military and that's why we're seeing
[3:24:17.280 --> 3:24:20.880]  a lot of police and military come up to us at ground zero on video they like
[3:24:20.880 --> 3:24:23.120]  we're out there and support us and help us out
[3:24:23.120 --> 3:24:25.840]  they're coming up on video now and that's a big deal yeah
[3:24:25.840 --> 3:24:29.200]  yeah and you know they're giving us army patches with not eleven truth on
[3:24:29.200 --> 3:24:32.960]  there and and they're huge supporters of what we're doing because we the people
[3:24:32.960 --> 3:24:36.640]  support them the government the elites do not support them and that's what we
[3:24:36.640 --> 3:24:39.760]  have to understand we have to reach out there's five trillion for the bankers
[3:24:39.760 --> 3:24:43.280]  but nothing for the firemen exactly and that's why
[3:24:43.280 --> 3:24:46.640]  this movement is going to be successful because the police and the military are
[3:24:46.640 --> 3:24:49.840]  going to be on our side and it's our job to educate them about what's really
[3:24:49.840 --> 3:24:53.440]  happening but yet again security is rubbing up i went to the bill clinton
[3:24:53.440 --> 3:24:58.080]  event couple weeks ago and you know i'm i'm getting right close to bill clinton
[3:24:58.080 --> 3:25:00.720]  get ready to shake his hand getting ready to talk to him
[3:25:00.720 --> 3:25:03.840]  and before that i have security duck just hit me on my shoulder
[3:25:03.840 --> 3:25:08.160]  pushed me away and they and and the whole time i realized i was being followed
[3:25:08.160 --> 3:25:11.280]  by uh secret service in the event wherever i went
[3:25:11.280 --> 3:25:14.960]  throughout the event but then luckily well look i don't i mean frankly i don't
[3:25:14.960 --> 3:25:18.560]  blame them you did plant a power i mean this is on record a big
[3:25:18.560 --> 3:25:24.000]  powerful was great audio system in the bill clinton cfr meeting and then they
[3:25:24.000 --> 3:25:27.040]  went in the bathroom tell folks that story when you get back okay
[3:25:27.040 --> 3:25:30.480]  you definitely i mean you talk about effective shaking up these murdering
[3:25:30.480 --> 3:25:34.160]  scumbag criminals bill clinton's been involved in all the big white
[3:25:34.160 --> 3:25:37.840]  kidnapping rings all the slave camps they get little kids and snuff film and
[3:25:37.840 --> 3:25:40.960]  blow their brains out go read all the government documents on that if you
[3:25:40.960 --> 3:25:44.160]  don't believe me oh yeah and paul's and everyone what you know show
[3:25:44.160 --> 3:25:47.760]  you're right now mainstream news yeah bill clinton supports it
[3:25:47.760 --> 3:25:53.600]  blow little kids heads off we're on the march the empires on the run
[3:25:53.600 --> 3:25:58.080]  alex jones and the gcn radio hey let me have to look for the internet audience
[3:25:58.080 --> 3:26:02.720]  someone keep going here hey luke paul's the guy i hired out of
[3:26:02.720 --> 3:26:06.320]  kehlbj also works for local tv station and he's come along he's a smart guy
[3:26:06.320 --> 3:26:09.600]  but i always say something every day kind of freaks him out why don't you tell
[3:26:09.600 --> 3:26:12.400]  him because and of course we have thousands of articles this is mainstream
[3:26:12.400 --> 3:26:16.160]  news about clinton and dinecore and then under
[3:26:16.160 --> 3:26:21.280]  bush clinton uh dinecore and haliburton uh the bbc ap
[3:26:21.280 --> 3:26:23.840]  reuters people don't know about this because it never gets in the nightly
[3:26:23.840 --> 3:26:28.000]  news is only in the newspapers about the giant slave rings and the kids and the
[3:26:28.000 --> 3:26:30.400]  snuff rings and how they do snuff films
[3:26:30.400 --> 3:26:36.080]  the kofi anana gave the contracts to him the u n general secretary kofi anon
[3:26:36.080 --> 3:26:38.960]  and we were at when we asked kofi anon he just went away
[3:26:38.960 --> 3:26:42.720]  about those issues and then there's been congressional hearings
[3:26:42.720 --> 3:26:45.920]  where rumsfeld just said uh we're not gonna talk about it yeah we're not
[3:26:45.920 --> 3:26:50.800]  taking it uh dinecore's uh contract away and that's just ridiculous i mean
[3:26:50.800 --> 3:26:53.680]  kofi anon was coming out and we asked him how come he gave
[3:26:53.680 --> 3:26:57.920]  contracts to dinecore when he knew they uh they had child slavery
[3:26:57.920 --> 3:27:01.840]  slavery rings and sex rings in africa i mean it's just ludicrous and this man
[3:27:01.840 --> 3:27:04.880]  just walked away ran away from the question is what all that would all
[3:27:04.880 --> 3:27:07.920]  just think it wasn't just africa they grabbed over a million kids
[3:27:07.920 --> 3:27:12.320]  and i was about 200 000 of them just out of central europe alone
[3:27:12.320 --> 3:27:16.880]  and then the italian tv reported uh that they were snuff films and then sold in
[3:27:16.880 --> 3:27:19.760]  the u.s. i mean these people are just sick it just
[3:27:19.760 --> 3:27:24.080]  just shows you what kind of people these really i mean it is just incredible
[3:27:24.080 --> 3:27:27.760]  knowing that these people will stoop down that low and do these horrible things
[3:27:27.760 --> 3:27:30.960]  and nobody knows about them everybody thinks they're heroes everybody shakes
[3:27:30.960 --> 3:27:34.480]  their hands but that's their religion their religion is about torturing a
[3:27:34.480 --> 3:27:38.880]  small child the power of the the horror the crushing the innocence they and
[3:27:38.880 --> 3:27:42.240]  they just run everything and they're pretty good look at the mock child
[3:27:42.240 --> 3:27:46.080]  sacrifices at the behemian grove that all the elected officials go to each
[3:27:46.080 --> 3:27:50.960]  summer i mean that you expose i mean you just it's crazy and we also got video
[3:27:50.960 --> 3:27:55.280]  we confronted bill richardson again when he was running for president about the
[3:27:55.280 --> 3:27:59.440]  behemian grove and he was just sweating i mean it was at a press conference i
[3:27:59.440 --> 3:28:03.360]  shook his hand i was the first question i was like sir can you please tell me
[3:28:03.360 --> 3:28:06.880]  when you give the keynote speeches behemian grove what did you do there and
[3:28:06.880 --> 3:28:10.080]  and how come new york times reports that there's male prostitutes
[3:28:10.080 --> 3:28:13.440]  shipped in there and the man just literally looked at me and just turned
[3:28:13.440 --> 3:28:17.360]  his back to me and and started talking to the other press guys and then madly
[3:28:17.360 --> 3:28:21.120]  pasted from the other side just nailed him again what do you do at the behemian
[3:28:21.120 --> 3:28:24.560]  grove and then i nailed him again and then mad nailed him again and literally
[3:28:24.560 --> 3:28:28.240]  about five times we asked him the question right to his face and he just
[3:28:28.240 --> 3:28:32.080]  turns around and doesn't say a single word which shows you these people have
[3:28:32.080 --> 3:28:35.040]  something to hide they don't want to talk about
[3:28:35.040 --> 3:28:39.520]  yeah yeah yeah bare minimum it's top gay porn stars daily

[3:33:23.520 --> 3:33:26.960]  the mainstream media won't talk about and that's what it's about the people
[3:33:26.960 --> 3:33:30.960]  coming out there being involved getting to these elected officials letting
[3:33:30.960 --> 3:33:33.520]  know that letting know that we know and exposing them
[3:33:33.520 --> 3:33:36.640]  all over youtube questioning about the hard questions that the mainstream
[3:33:36.640 --> 3:33:40.880]  media will never ask and and i am so great to have so many amazing people in
[3:33:40.880 --> 3:33:44.080]  our group like sabrina matt brian anthony

[3:33:59.920 --> 3:34:02.320]  new people to come in and confront these politicians
[3:34:02.320 --> 3:34:05.520]  and that's why it's so important to get involved if you're in a twice day area

[3:37:39.200 --> 3:37:42.800]  that's what makes me flip out is that is that i understand what
[3:37:42.800 --> 3:37:45.120]  we're facing and luke understands what we're facing
[3:37:45.120 --> 3:37:48.800]  and no matter how crazy you can imagine it's even crazier than that i mean
[3:37:48.800 --> 3:37:54.640]  these people are pure scum and uh and and and they will hurt
[3:37:54.640 --> 3:37:58.240]  us bad folks you know i mean we need to understand that slavery is the name of
[3:37:58.240 --> 3:38:01.440]  the game and i am not a slave uh but luke i mean look at we are
[3:38:01.440 --> 3:38:04.240]  changed all over the i i didn't see the carl roe video i wish
[3:38:04.240 --> 3:38:08.080]  when the security guard walks up outside on the city street and says turn your
[3:38:08.080 --> 3:38:11.760]  camera off they did folks nobody's allowed to tell you that we know we stood
[3:38:11.760 --> 3:38:14.720]  up to cops and they're going to frame us with bombs if we don't turn it off
[3:38:14.720 --> 3:38:18.800]  luke has i've gone through similar crap i mean explain that to people luke
[3:38:18.800 --> 3:38:22.080]  i mean that was anthony and matt i was actually looking for carl roe all the
[3:38:22.080 --> 3:38:24.240]  way on the sixth floor i was on the sixth floor
[3:38:24.240 --> 3:38:27.680]  because he went up i kept trying to look for him i counter invaded all the
[3:38:27.680 --> 3:38:31.120]  security guards matt and anthony got grabbed by security guards they got
[3:38:31.120 --> 3:38:34.000]  evacuated out the building and as they were being evacuated
[3:38:34.000 --> 3:38:37.120]  out the building they see carl roe in the lobby and they could front carl roe
[3:38:37.120 --> 3:38:40.400]  in the lobby and then in in the garage a little area there
[3:38:40.400 --> 3:38:43.280]  and then afterwards they tell him you know turn off your camera you know you
[3:38:43.280 --> 3:38:46.000]  can't feel me even though it's a public street
[3:38:46.000 --> 3:38:49.760]  and uh thank god anthony did not turn off the cameras and they had no
[3:38:49.760 --> 3:38:53.200]  real grievance against them and they let them go it's a form of intimidation
[3:38:53.200 --> 3:38:56.240]  at the scare tactic they're trying to get us scared they're trying to get us
[3:38:56.240 --> 3:39:00.000]  intimidated but whatever you do don't ever turn off your camera
[3:39:00.000 --> 3:39:03.920]  in a public street they will try to set you up and the power that this little
[3:39:03.920 --> 3:39:08.320]  video camera has is incredible because it shows everything it
[3:39:08.320 --> 3:39:11.920]  exposes criminals and that's why we have to use
[3:39:11.920 --> 3:39:15.680]  our technology the youtube you know the video cameras out there
[3:39:15.680 --> 3:39:19.680]  for our benefit and it's a beautiful tool and i hope more people use it because
[3:39:19.680 --> 3:39:23.840]  the more we use it the more we are able to show the world what's really
[3:39:23.840 --> 3:39:27.200]  happening and the only thing we have to lose is the change
[3:39:27.200 --> 3:39:31.200]  around our hands and knees because that's there's nothing to lose
[3:39:31.200 --> 3:39:34.400]  you know there's only freedom to gain there's only things that we could better
[3:39:34.400 --> 3:39:38.080]  ourselves absolutely look look you're also working on a new film

[3:44:31.280 --> 3:44:36.480]  uh bbc shunned me for denying climate change one of their top
[3:44:36.480 --> 3:44:42.240]  presenters uh david bellamy for decades uh was told well you're not going to say
[3:44:42.240 --> 3:44:44.720]  global warming is real you're not going to say that plants
[3:44:44.720 --> 3:44:48.800]  you know that that carbon dioxide toxic waste you're you're basically fired
[3:44:48.800 --> 3:44:52.720]  um all part of the freedom guardians of the unborn the dutch parliament is
[3:44:52.720 --> 3:44:56.000]  considering whether protecting unborn children should supersede the rights of
[3:44:56.000 --> 3:45:00.320]  parents to procreate and they say they're protecting the
[3:45:00.320 --> 3:45:05.840]  rights of the children by not letting them have children
[3:45:05.840 --> 3:45:09.760]  and that uh they're going to put people on drugs
[3:45:09.760 --> 3:45:13.360]  that basically sterilize them but but then the spin is
[3:45:13.360 --> 3:45:18.240]  oh we're going to give you super rights your genetics are bad
[3:45:18.240 --> 3:45:21.760]  you have a predisposition you can't have children
[3:45:21.760 --> 3:45:28.560]  and see now it's the eugenics well part of the freedom government black boxes
[3:45:28.560 --> 3:45:31.600]  will collect every email on the independent and the government admits
[3:45:31.600 --> 3:45:34.800]  every email every phone call goes through their nsa system we already have
[3:45:34.800 --> 3:45:37.840]  it here they're just announcing it to their slaves there and letting you know
[3:45:37.840 --> 3:45:42.080]  everything you do is red because it's freedom because we're a criminal
[3:45:42.080 --> 3:45:44.720]  government and it's not just the parliament the
[3:45:44.720 --> 3:45:48.160]  parliament is spied on it has no rights and runs nothing
[3:45:48.160 --> 3:45:52.080]  that's admitted that they have agents that spy off from the executive
[3:45:52.080 --> 3:45:55.200]  which is controlled by the queen
[3:45:55.840 --> 3:45:59.920]  but then the queen owns a bunch of tv companies that put out shows making fun
[3:45:59.920 --> 3:46:03.280]  of her to make it look like she's weak and pathetic did you know that they
[3:46:03.280 --> 3:46:06.640]  own most of the big tabloids that and the video companies
[3:46:06.640 --> 3:46:10.320]  that only get the access to them and then they make themselves look
[3:46:10.320 --> 3:46:16.720]  buffoonish to fool the idiot public very sophisticated very sophisticated
[3:46:17.120 --> 3:46:21.920]  putin may return to kremlin in 09 report
[3:46:23.280 --> 3:46:27.360]  more corruption over there plea for more research
[3:46:27.360 --> 3:46:30.880]  cash is two billion bees die from rampant disease long in telegraph
[3:46:30.880 --> 3:46:35.280]  they know what's killing the bees they know
[3:46:35.280 --> 3:46:39.280]  um it's the aluminum dioxide that's sprang out of the aircraft for the now
[3:46:39.280 --> 3:46:43.360]  admitted terraforming of the planet and uh several
[3:46:43.360 --> 3:46:47.360]  genetically engineered species of corn that grow pesticide in the corn
[3:46:47.360 --> 3:46:51.360]  so mugs won't eat it the pesticide is expressed
[3:46:51.360 --> 3:46:57.040]  uh in the corn while it's pollinating and so it's killing all the bees
[3:46:57.040 --> 3:47:02.240]  government care less they love it i'm gonna skip this break i'm gonna keep
[3:47:02.240 --> 3:47:05.520]  talking even though we're not on the aim and fm because this is too important
[3:47:05.520 --> 3:47:10.080]  and see that's the thing the establishment is busy butchering the
[3:47:10.080 --> 3:47:13.360]  environment genetically engineering splicing everything killing things
[3:47:13.360 --> 3:47:17.600]  burning things murdering uh animals you know a whole
[3:47:17.600 --> 3:47:21.600]  species all sorts of scams corruption they could care less about the
[3:47:21.600 --> 3:47:25.360]  environment in fact i've talked to a lot of globalist
[3:47:25.360 --> 3:47:28.640]  uh and i've read their publications and they say there is no
[3:47:28.640 --> 3:47:32.800]  unnatural genetic mutation there is no unnatural thing
[3:47:32.800 --> 3:47:36.800]  anything we do as humans is an expression
[3:47:36.800 --> 3:47:41.680]  of evolution and so if we kill the whole earth it's beautiful
[3:47:41.680 --> 3:47:46.000]  and they say it's it's a normal part of evolution that machines take over it's
[3:47:46.000 --> 3:47:49.040]  a normal part of evolution that the honeybees die
[3:47:49.040 --> 3:47:52.800]  that any chemicals or biologicals that they put out that kill animals
[3:47:52.800 --> 3:47:55.680]  or or and i've talked to people that work for ibm and others and i'll say but
[3:47:55.680 --> 3:47:59.440]  what about genetic engineering cross species part human part animal clones
[3:47:59.440 --> 3:48:02.320]  you know what about human rights what about that dangerous precedent they go
[3:48:02.320 --> 3:48:08.160]  there is no abnormal mutation there is no morals but then they'll tell you the
[3:48:08.160 --> 3:48:11.600]  public the morals for the earth carbon oxides
[3:48:11.600 --> 3:48:15.760]  deadly we've got to ban it and restrict it it's involved in all
[3:48:15.760 --> 3:48:19.520]  manufacturing it's what humans exhale all their animals exhale it
[3:48:19.520 --> 3:48:22.000]  that's a way to regularly say they're gonna tax you for breathing that's a
[3:48:22.000 --> 3:48:25.360]  new york times headline so see oh my god the carbon dioxide it's
[3:48:25.360 --> 3:48:29.360]  so deadly the earth the polar bears are drowning they can swim
[3:48:29.360 --> 3:48:33.040]  i mean knowing that the just total insult to the public
[3:48:33.040 --> 3:48:36.800]  all those naturalists look at the look at the then they're stuck on the ice
[3:48:36.800 --> 3:48:40.720]  flow they'll die our cubs won't make it they can swim
[3:48:40.720 --> 3:48:43.920]  on all the shows i saw on tv this week i never even watched tv
[3:48:43.920 --> 3:48:47.200]  polar bears can swim again 300 miles they hunt on ice flows
[3:48:47.200 --> 3:48:50.400]  doesn't matter they think of you as idiots they think of you as scum they
[3:48:50.400 --> 3:48:53.120]  think of you as trash and believe me you act like a lot of you
[3:48:53.120 --> 3:48:55.200]  i'm talking to our general audience but some of the people out there that love
[3:48:55.200 --> 3:48:59.680]  to be lied to and so again oh my god the earth carbon dioxide we've
[3:48:59.680 --> 3:49:01.760]  got to take over people's farms and ranches in there
[3:49:01.760 --> 3:49:06.160]  we've got to fine and fee everybody the earth the earth see they pick something
[3:49:06.160 --> 3:49:09.120]  that has nothing to do with hurting the environment so that it doesn't affect
[3:49:09.120 --> 3:49:12.400]  any of their dirty industries then they take the whole environmental movement
[3:49:12.400 --> 3:49:15.840]  that people are concerned about and then they take all of our energy
[3:49:15.840 --> 3:49:19.440]  for a good environment and put it into setting up a world government
[3:49:19.440 --> 3:49:23.360]  and tattletale squads and feudalism and regulation and control
[3:49:23.360 --> 3:49:29.600]  meanwhile GMO crops are killing animals everywhere birds populations worldwide
[3:49:29.600 --> 3:49:33.840]  wherever GMO crops are are dying out animals of fish
[3:49:33.840 --> 3:49:37.200]  the hormones in the water that we secrete from drinking the plastics
[3:49:37.200 --> 3:49:41.600]  are making the fish in the in the frogs in some areas 80 90 percent of them
[3:49:41.600 --> 3:49:44.640]  you know are bisexual or don't have sexual organs
[3:49:44.640 --> 3:49:48.000]  it's killing the humans all this real environmental degradation
[3:49:48.000 --> 3:49:51.040]  and they go oh that's nothing and they're about to give total immunity
[3:49:51.040 --> 3:49:54.560]  in the u.s. and england and europe to all drug makers they can kill us with
[3:49:54.560 --> 3:49:57.840]  whatever they want they can try to make us take it it doesn't matter it's just
[3:49:57.840 --> 3:50:03.040]  total takeover evil at every level let's go back live
[3:50:08.880 --> 3:50:12.640]  the new world order is a giant psycho palace
[3:50:12.640 --> 3:50:15.760]  psychopaths creating a wonderland to torture and kill and
[3:50:15.760 --> 3:50:19.440]  genetically engineer and kill wildlife and kill species and
[3:50:19.440 --> 3:50:22.720]  re-engineer the biosphere and they say there's no such thing as a real
[3:50:22.720 --> 3:50:26.160]  mutation i mean as a as a false mutation they
[3:50:26.160 --> 3:50:29.840]  say it's great the honey bees are dying it's great that the GMO foods are
[3:50:29.840 --> 3:50:32.800]  killing masses of humans and other animals
[3:50:32.800 --> 3:50:36.240]  horses won't drink fluoridated water but they force them to till they die
[3:50:36.240 --> 3:50:40.240]  they give us the fluoride water billions and billions of bees dying
[3:50:40.240 --> 3:50:43.520]  entire areas not even having the flowers being pollinated
[3:50:43.520 --> 3:50:49.040]  and meanwhile they've got us ready to ban co2 that plants breathe
[3:50:49.040 --> 3:50:52.080]  this is the reality of what we face ladies and gentlemen i'm not kidding
[3:50:52.080 --> 3:50:54.480]  about any of it
[3:50:54.480 --> 3:50:57.760]  you know what i meant to get to all this news but it's all up on prismplanet.com
[3:50:57.760 --> 3:51:00.960]  and info wars.com and and folks i can't even describe how
[3:51:00.960 --> 3:51:05.760]  bad it is as bad as i'm making it sound it's a hundred times worse it's just
[3:51:05.760 --> 3:51:09.440]  we have been in this incrementally with it slowly being turned up around us
[3:51:09.440 --> 3:51:12.240]  and everything looks like it's okay but your neighbors kids are being kidnapped
[3:51:12.240 --> 3:51:15.680]  your neighbors dying of cancer you know all the stuff's going on there's people
[3:51:15.680 --> 3:51:18.480]  are dying people got all these health problems
[3:51:18.480 --> 3:51:22.320]  the kids are all turning to demons watching tv everything's falling apart
[3:51:22.320 --> 3:51:25.760]  the economy's imploding there's militarized hate cops everywhere
[3:51:25.760 --> 3:51:29.920]  brainwashed yuppies scampering around brainwashed obama worshipers hopping
[3:51:29.920 --> 3:51:32.800]  around you know what i said i'd go to some

[3:51:47.040 --> 3:51:51.600]  a comment in regards to us and to make any of the press conference last week
[3:51:51.600 --> 3:51:56.160]  i didn't see it it's uh... she did it uh... september 28th at the critical
[3:51:56.160 --> 3:52:00.240]  resistance conference in oakland uh... she was talking about uh... a mother of
[3:52:00.240 --> 3:52:03.520]  a soldier with a dm or t
[3:52:03.520 --> 3:52:07.440]  uh... came to her saying that he was in charge oh yeah i know about the thing
[3:52:07.440 --> 3:52:11.680]  about yet go ahead i'm sorry finished the story of
[3:52:11.680 --> 3:52:15.360]  well she said that the mother uh... her son had told her
[3:52:15.360 --> 3:52:19.760]  although he had signed papers of secrecy that he logged in
[3:52:19.760 --> 3:52:23.120]  four to five thousand bodies all with a single gunshot to the head during
[3:52:23.120 --> 3:52:27.600]  katrina incident and uh... she said that she has verified it through the red
[3:52:27.600 --> 3:52:31.840]  cross and sources uh... in the d o d that they have a cataloged
[3:52:31.840 --> 3:52:35.200]  or uh... referred to there as well i know we've been trying to get her on
[3:52:35.200 --> 3:52:37.440]  about that i didn't know specifically which press conference we're talking
[3:52:37.440 --> 3:52:38.080]  about
[3:52:38.080 --> 3:52:42.240]  i don't know if that is fully true but i talked to a lot of police
[3:52:42.240 --> 3:52:47.440]  i mean here's an example i talked to the police i talked to a family of police
[3:52:47.440 --> 3:52:51.440]  on the texas coast thousands died not 45 or whatever they say
[3:52:51.440 --> 3:52:54.320]  thousands whole dead families up in their addicts that didn't go out when
[3:52:54.320 --> 3:52:58.240]  they were you know told to uh... there were a lot of looters shot
[3:52:58.240 --> 3:53:01.200]  there were police have gone to prison for shooting innocent people that were
[3:53:01.200 --> 3:53:04.800]  unarmed they did kill hundreds of people
[3:53:04.800 --> 3:53:09.040]  they did kill some of them execution style mainly they just sprayed them
[3:53:09.040 --> 3:53:13.360]  with machine gun fire uh... i don't know about five thousand
[3:53:13.360 --> 3:53:16.960]  uh... but i put nothing past them now we know that was a laboratory
[3:53:16.960 --> 3:53:21.680]  to test to send in troops under fb i command to go into the even wealthy
[3:53:21.680 --> 3:53:25.600]  areas that were high and dry and take the guns they were never given back
[3:53:25.600 --> 3:53:29.840]  uh... so uh... but i don't know about five thousand killed i know they did
[3:53:29.840 --> 3:53:32.080]  practice corrupting the troops and police
[3:53:32.080 --> 3:53:35.040]  under fb i homeland security north com command
[3:53:35.040 --> 3:53:38.360]  uh... in stealing property in looting and raping women
[3:53:38.360 --> 3:53:41.680]  uh... in uh... not giving people their property back
[3:53:41.680 --> 3:53:45.200]  in gun confiscation and in covering up hundreds they murdered
[3:53:45.200 --> 3:53:49.440]  uh... but a few people like public machine gunning families on bridges
[3:53:49.440 --> 3:53:53.320]  and the cops lied and claim they had guns that turned out that wasn't true
[3:53:53.320 --> 3:53:56.240]  mainly what happened is you have troops looting and killing
[3:53:56.240 --> 3:53:59.320]  as they always do and they would run into other cops looting and killing
[3:53:59.320 --> 3:54:02.160]  with the militia and they would have a little shootouts with each other
[3:54:02.160 --> 3:54:05.080]  she also had a lot of and and then they would throw fits after a friendly fire
[3:54:05.080 --> 3:54:05.640]  and just
[3:54:05.640 --> 3:54:08.600]  fly over the helicopters and shoot people
[3:54:08.600 --> 3:54:10.880]  because you know that's what demons do after they kill each other they have a
[3:54:10.880 --> 3:54:12.840]  little celebration murder
[3:54:12.840 --> 3:54:16.760]  uh... that's quite normal troops have mass rapes and burnings and killings and
[3:54:16.760 --> 3:54:18.680]  they froth and kill each other too
[3:54:18.680 --> 3:54:20.320]  argue over looting booty
[3:54:20.320 --> 3:54:23.400]  all around the time of their happy program
[3:54:23.400 --> 3:54:26.720]  uh... welcome to my brain folks welcome to the stuff i know is going on the
[3:54:26.720 --> 3:54:28.920]  things i'm freaked out about
[3:54:28.920 --> 3:54:32.240]  and uh... i'm so i'm gonna stay here in the u.s. and fight till the end but
[3:54:32.240 --> 3:54:34.840]  you have to hear me flip out on there is this stuff flipping me out
[3:54:34.840 --> 3:54:37.560]  all right we had uh... bunch of key guest on the day of the first hour was
[3:54:37.560 --> 3:54:38.480]  focused in a
[3:54:38.480 --> 3:54:41.360]  starts at info wars dot com
[3:54:41.360 --> 3:54:42.800]  you are listening to gc
[3:54:42.800 --> 3:55:11.880]  oh my god
