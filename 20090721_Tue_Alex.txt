[09:15.560 --> 09:22.200]  slaves are busy watching American Idol the slaves are busy watching the hills
[09:22.200 --> 09:28.920]  the slaves are busy drinking their sodium fluoride water taking their
[09:28.920 --> 09:35.560]  inoculations the slaves are right where they need to be you know I've lived
[09:35.560 --> 09:42.960]  here in Austin under the commissariat rule Austin was a test city in the last
[09:42.960 --> 09:47.760]  20 years and they've stolen every few years tens of thousands of acres I
[09:47.760 --> 09:53.440]  haven't counted them all up in one land grab they grabbed 20,000 acres plus that
[09:53.440 --> 09:59.160]  I witnessed in 1998 save our springs first they would tell the landowners in
[09:59.160 --> 10:02.800]  and around the county that they couldn't build on their property but then they
[10:02.800 --> 10:08.520]  would keep jacking up their property tax and just laughing at them and telling
[10:08.520 --> 10:12.920]  them you try to build anything on your property we got some boys who take some
[10:12.920 --> 10:20.680]  steroids and wear some black uniforms and they got weapons and that was
[10:20.680 --> 10:25.520]  basically the end of it and so they took the property and they've since built
[10:25.520 --> 10:33.760]  five-star hotels million dollar houses all over it they've since built five
[10:33.760 --> 10:41.440]  star weekend spas they've since built luxury facility for themselves they
[10:41.440 --> 10:48.640]  don't just steal your property they've been personally set up land banks the
[10:48.640 --> 10:53.040]  mayors and former mayors and people and then they personally divvy up the land
[10:53.040 --> 10:59.360]  and the public takes it sucks their thumbs so why not rate more and so now
[10:59.360 --> 11:05.320]  they're gonna tax everything you do worldwide and if you don't like it
[11:05.320 --> 11:10.600]  they're gonna send paramilitary forces to murder you because you lay there and
[11:10.600 --> 11:17.560]  you take it and so you're gonna take a lot more oh yeah so I'll read over this
[11:17.560 --> 11:24.920]  bill later for you it's just so incredible to see this scum and
[11:24.920 --> 11:29.040]  continuing to have victory after victory after victory they're not even good
[11:29.040 --> 11:34.560]  liars all these effeminate chicken necks and little suits up there speaking
[11:34.560 --> 11:38.880]  with a little sticky sweet voices they a little corporate seminars to learn how
[11:38.880 --> 11:48.520]  to be non-threatening and and sound soothing and and establishment scamming
[11:48.520 --> 11:55.360]  and lying and defrauding and stealing and federalizing everything feds
[11:55.360 --> 11:59.360]  prepared attacks toilet paper in the name of climate change the government
[11:59.360 --> 12:08.320]  wants to shake us down for our visits to the lavatory that's right and when they
[12:08.320 --> 12:13.720]  get question when Al Gore and others get question they say use your hand but then
[12:13.720 --> 12:18.640]  of course the water has a carbon footprint to there'll be an extra tax
[12:18.640 --> 12:26.040]  there it's all about acts of submission acts of supplication going through the
[12:26.040 --> 12:31.120]  airport what's an interesting story going through the airport in Austin
[12:31.120 --> 12:38.960]  through Homeland Security the federalization of transportation going
[12:38.960 --> 12:44.840]  through the airport in Austin I watched a two and a half year old maybe three
[12:44.840 --> 12:48.160]  year old boy in front of me he was in a stroller it's probably about two actually
[12:48.160 --> 12:54.480]  and he was asleep but his mother shook him awake and got him awake and she
[12:54.480 --> 13:00.400]  said honey you've got to take off your shoes everyone does honey everyone has
[13:00.400 --> 13:05.560]  to get on the train's honey everyone has to be deloused everyone has to take a
[13:05.560 --> 13:12.800]  shower and so he got up and he took his shoes off and sleepily went through and
[13:12.800 --> 13:23.200]  they they sternly looked at him but the first guy who took my ID and ticket
[13:23.200 --> 13:28.840]  said oh Alex Jones and smiled at me and I'm thinking oh boy then I go through the
[13:28.840 --> 13:32.800]  checkpoint and put my stuff back in my bag so you got to take cameras and
[13:32.800 --> 13:38.600]  equipment out make sure not terrorist of course and one fellow came over and said
[13:38.600 --> 13:46.240]  oh I'm a big fan of the show and a lot of us are awake here but the issue was
[13:46.240 --> 13:50.840]  there was that little boy being inducted into bondage being inducted into
[13:50.840 --> 13:58.280]  slavery being inducted into tyranny being taught how to be a slave take your
[13:58.280 --> 14:02.440]  shoes off walk on the athlete's foot floor I mean you think you get athletes
[14:02.440 --> 14:07.440]  foot in a gym or an athlete's foot at the local pool when you go to the bathroom
[14:07.440 --> 14:14.480]  imagine the thousands of people's feet but oh it didn't matter during the flu
[14:14.480 --> 14:24.520]  scare everybody still took their shoes off and went across because it had
[14:24.520 --> 14:28.240]  nothing to do with the flu it was about training you how to be a slave how to be
[14:28.240 --> 14:32.880]  face scanned how to have your temperature taken how to line up hundreds of
[14:32.880 --> 14:37.280]  different children's toys I've seen are all about lining up and taking microchips
[14:37.280 --> 14:41.600]  are getting tested for the flu or going through police checkpoints everybody's
[14:41.600 --> 14:45.760]  being indoctrinated in the Hollywood movies and the TV shows the whole culture
[14:45.760 --> 14:56.320]  with the predictive programming the conditioning the acclimation but I
[14:56.320 --> 15:01.960]  watched that little boy go through and I couldn't control myself as I'm stacking
[15:01.960 --> 15:15.200]  up my equipment to send it through the X-rayer I am saw a woman sitting there
[15:15.200 --> 15:20.280]  talking to a man well she was getting her stuff out I said I said there I said
[15:20.280 --> 15:23.440]  you know this is all training you to be a slave and to submit she looked at me
[15:23.440 --> 15:28.920]  she said I know oh and I saw something new at the Austin airport it said total
[15:28.920 --> 15:35.680]  body scanning we no longer want you yes they they have the naked body scanners
[15:35.680 --> 15:39.440]  there but notice there's no announcement see I see these announcements about
[15:39.440 --> 15:47.920]  Boston got it and Salt Lake City got it and I saw the couple years ago it said
[15:47.920 --> 15:53.240]  214 airports got it so I guess Austin's got it and I was already ready if they
[15:53.240 --> 15:58.240]  told me to go through that I said no you get a hand wand out to make sure I'm
[15:58.240 --> 16:03.440]  not a sum of bin Laden you're not getting to have my testicles on your video
[16:03.440 --> 16:13.760]  camera I know it's extreme I know I'm evil to be able to think but it scans
[16:13.760 --> 16:19.720]  your body 360 it uses basically sonar radar bounces off your body the sound
[16:19.720 --> 16:25.640]  waves that the little little beams it sends out the magnetic beams there's
[16:25.640 --> 16:29.000]  different types of them this was a magnetic one and then it creates an
[16:29.000 --> 16:32.880]  image of your body and they put it on the news and say here you are here you
[16:32.880 --> 16:40.120]  are naked send your little kids through your daughters your wives let the TSA

[17:18.640 --> 17:26.040]  going to rule and now they're announcing all over the news because I saw an

[24:22.440 --> 24:43.440]  We are back live 1-800-259-9231 look I'm already going into Iran said I want to take a lot
[24:43.440 --> 24:48.640]  of calls we will cover massive stacks of vital news and information coming up in
[24:48.640 --> 24:54.600]  the next three hours and 35 minutes but right now let's go back go back we haven't
[24:54.600 --> 25:01.240]  gone to him yet to your phone call Susan in Oklahoma welcome hello hi Susan well
[25:01.240 --> 25:06.160]  I was calling with part of the question to get your input on it and then tell you
[25:06.160 --> 25:12.240]  what my thought was I'd listen to your end game towards the end of 08 and at the
[25:12.240 --> 25:17.360]  couple months into 09 I got a hold of the Obama deception and I started looking
[25:17.360 --> 25:24.080]  up on YouTube and researched and found the mic report yes and on the on the
[25:24.080 --> 25:27.960]  Christian identity has anyone ever called you on that particular part of the
[25:27.960 --> 25:34.160]  mic report and commented on it well no but Christian identity is a very large
[25:34.160 --> 25:37.760]  group of people I would say most of the groups I've looked into you couldn't
[25:37.760 --> 25:43.400]  even really call racist they're just saying that they believe that certain
[25:43.400 --> 25:48.520]  groups of Europeans are God's chosen people but I mean it demonizes anything
[25:48.520 --> 25:53.280]  and everything in the mic report Ron Paul anti-UN groups pro-second
[25:53.280 --> 25:59.200]  amendment groups veterans groups so it's just an abomination the issue that I
[25:59.200 --> 26:04.560]  have with the three things that is listed was I was shocked at first that it
[26:04.560 --> 26:10.280]  didn't mention the things that you would hear in the media would be the
[26:10.280 --> 26:15.120]  preaching of preachers preaching things that seemed racist or against a certain
[26:15.120 --> 26:19.520]  gay or abortion or any type things that don't seem to be politically correct
[26:19.520 --> 26:24.120]  these days but that isn't listed on this particular paper I have only three
[26:24.120 --> 26:29.160]  things are listed and you know I have a bunch of I have a bunch of different
[26:29.160 --> 26:32.960]  reports believe me they list everything under the sun they list animal rights
[26:32.960 --> 26:38.440]  groups environmental groups free speech groups bike writing groups basically
[26:38.440 --> 26:42.840]  anybody who can talk is a terrorist I mean if you're sitting there on
[26:42.840 --> 26:48.600]  fluoride and prozac and riddling drooling they like you but if you can
[26:48.600 --> 26:53.000]  talk if you can think you're a threat because this is a criminal gang and they
[26:53.000 --> 26:57.000]  want everything they want it now and so anybody and that goes back to
[26:57.000 --> 27:02.800]  congressional hearings in 77 even leaders preachers pastors community
[27:02.800 --> 27:07.480]  leaders who were on the government side and agreed with the system were listed
[27:07.480 --> 27:13.320]  and had files on them and where they lived and arrest preparations ready under
[27:13.320 --> 27:18.480]  this martial law takeover because they might wake up somewhere down the road
[27:18.480 --> 27:23.440]  so they've got to be terminated later so that's why most of your police chiefs
[27:23.440 --> 27:28.080]  and police captains they've got a you know a death squad has their number
[27:28.080 --> 27:33.000]  this is the Soviet slash Nazi takeover and you look what the Soviets and the
[27:33.000 --> 27:36.480]  Nazis did in other countries it's the same thing here this is just
[27:36.480 --> 27:43.640]  absolutely cold-blooded takeover the stuff that's on your movies which I've
[27:43.640 --> 27:48.480]  looked into further like all your movies you'll see a clip well I can look up the
[27:48.480 --> 27:52.440]  majority of them and find a longer version for instance when you walked up
[27:52.440 --> 27:57.200]  to that one man you're talking about that meeting that you embarked on went
[27:57.200 --> 28:00.960]  into and took pictures and that guy was pretty much telling you none of your
[28:00.960 --> 28:06.120]  business and walked out I've seen a bigger video of that so but the thing
[28:06.120 --> 28:10.680]  that gets me is this is something I've been studying for years that I knew was
[28:10.680 --> 28:15.760]  gonna come about and I didn't think that this particular part of the Christian
[28:15.760 --> 28:21.200]  identity that's on my mic report copy that I have with three things and those
[28:21.200 --> 28:27.480]  three things are exactly what our church is criticized for because they twist it
[28:27.480 --> 28:33.960]  to make it sound but what would be the threat of someone here saying they're
[28:33.960 --> 28:39.560]  from the lost tribes of Israel what is their threat to me every all that stuff
[28:39.560 --> 28:44.680]  links back to evil because they're repeating the tower babbling no I hear
[28:44.680 --> 28:49.680]  you over listen I appreciate your call ma'am we've got the clip if I got to put
[28:49.680 --> 28:56.040]  that in the film because in this new Obama film right a note guys please we
[28:56.040 --> 28:59.480]  show how they're not demonizing Christian grips in these federal reports
[28:59.480 --> 29:07.040]  well Janet Reno said on 60 minutes that anyone who believes in the return of
[29:07.040 --> 29:17.120]  Jesus Christ is a terrorist period they're they're not playing games these
[29:17.120 --> 29:21.560]  I just I don't know people understand me I don't just get up here for effect and
[29:21.560 --> 29:26.080]  say they're planning to kill you and your family I mean you sing all over the
[29:26.080 --> 29:30.360]  news they're talking about eugenics and population control Hillary in India two
[29:30.360 --> 29:34.840]  days ago called for global family planning to lower carbon footprints and
[29:34.840 --> 29:40.120]  said that was the best way I mean this is real Hitler was real Stalin was real

[33:49.440 --> 33:54.200]  six months I'm 38 I was born raised in Minnesota and we uncovered some things
[33:54.200 --> 33:58.960]  in Arizona that we're going on I'm sure you heard about the coli and the
[33:58.960 --> 34:03.840]  vegetables and the lettuce and stuff well sure that's the that's the field
[34:03.840 --> 34:08.880]  workers are defecating on the food no actually it's not Alex we are using
[34:08.880 --> 34:14.040]  sewage to water it yes exactly they're using sewage to water all everyone's
[34:14.040 --> 34:18.960]  vegetables all winter long and we were exposing this and what's wrong with that
[34:18.960 --> 34:24.840]  they're following us with fucking black helicopter I'm gonna let you go sir all
[34:24.840 --> 34:30.600]  right all we got is a lot of dope smoking listeners folks you just think
[34:30.600 --> 34:33.360]  they can call up your door they want some you're banned from the show pal
[34:33.360 --> 34:48.400]  that's your problem it is no secret that they water the vegetables with sewage
[34:48.400 --> 34:53.720]  and it's no secret that that's why people are getting sick and dying and
[34:53.720 --> 34:58.200]  there's no secret that the globalist love it because that's their rule they
[34:58.200 --> 35:11.960]  create the crisis they offer the solution it's just that simple and I
[35:11.960 --> 35:20.600]  remember a 1996 the school lunch program headlined at thousands remember the
[35:20.600 --> 35:27.600]  exact how I think it was 6,000 students get hepatitis C from bad berries but I
[35:27.600 --> 35:33.080]  had the Washington Post article I remembered it and it was a big scandal
[35:33.080 --> 35:38.240]  because the federal government was buying the school lunch program berries
[35:38.240 --> 35:41.760]  because they were packaging federal meals that were being shipped to some of
[35:41.760 --> 35:49.640]  the schools and the berries were sprayed with human waste that had live
[35:49.640 --> 35:57.440]  hepatitis and other nasty things in it and then it was being flash frozen and
[35:57.440 --> 36:05.720]  so when it was unfrozen your children were getting fresh hepatitis what you're
[36:05.720 --> 36:11.200]  against fresh hepatitis you must be anti-american criticize the government
[36:11.200 --> 36:17.360]  you're helping Alcada not allowed to protest protesting helps Alcada I've
[36:17.360 --> 36:21.200]  actually seen the deputy attorney general of California say that no anti-war
[36:21.200 --> 36:27.040]  protests permits will be given out by the state oh yes because the war is
[36:27.040 --> 36:30.320]  fighting Alcada and so if you're protesting the war you're aiding Alcada
[36:30.320 --> 36:34.360]  so you can't make up the level of their tyranny
[36:41.800 --> 36:50.680]  oh it's pointless but anyways so they create the crisis of all over Mexico
[36:50.680 --> 36:53.360]  where we're getting a lot of our food now but also some of the United States of
[36:53.360 --> 37:01.600]  spraying the crops with untreated sewage and then the workers also do
[37:01.600 --> 37:05.440]  things in the fields don't wash their hands you get the pitcher and then when
[37:05.440 --> 37:09.360]  it gets here they they say for months we don't know why the cabbage and we don't
[37:09.360 --> 37:15.320]  know why the lettuce and we don't know why the squash and we don't know why
[37:15.320 --> 37:24.120]  the spinach is giving people hepatitis and giving people all these other
[37:24.120 --> 37:36.880]  things we don't know why and of course later it had come out in the news it was
[37:36.880 --> 37:44.240]  the sewage but now they're federalizing food production and and making
[37:44.240 --> 37:48.400]  food producers in the United States that are left jump through all these hoops and
[37:48.400 --> 37:53.680]  all these taxes and all these regulations and all this certification and
[37:53.680 --> 38:02.000]  animal ID and premises ID and water restrictions and in carbon taxes are
[38:02.000 --> 38:08.040]  coming down now further destroying US agriculture but then Mexico and all the
[38:08.040 --> 38:11.880]  other NAFTA and get countries they have none of those restrictions on when it
[38:11.880 --> 38:18.560]  comes in see all the restrictions are written for small farms small ranches
[38:18.560 --> 38:26.200]  and to shut down small organic operations just you know the name of
[38:26.200 --> 38:30.600]  stopping hepatitis and salmonella and the rest of it it has nothing to do with
[38:30.600 --> 38:37.960]  the small operations in the United States in fact under the bill that's left
[38:37.960 --> 38:42.520]  committee in the house that we've been covering the last few months it will
[38:42.520 --> 38:49.280]  shut down all of the organic farming because no manure is allowed no raw
[38:49.280 --> 38:55.920]  manure from cows or pigs or bats they mine guano some of it hundreds of years
[38:55.920 --> 39:04.760]  old totally clean totally good mixing into the soil when you plant what
[39:04.760 --> 39:12.120]  agriculture's done for 6,000 plus years no but you want to spray right out of the
[39:12.120 --> 39:19.320]  sewage tap human feces on it buddy you can you can just have a great time see
[39:19.320 --> 39:26.080]  everything's sick it's all sick Tyson chicken lobbies for years and gets the
[39:26.080 --> 39:31.320]  animal ID they've got facilities of millions and millions of chickens
[39:31.320 --> 39:34.680]  giant buildings with hundreds of thousands of chickens per building and
[39:34.680 --> 39:39.240]  some facilities hundreds of buildings so how many chickens is that is that in
[39:39.240 --> 39:45.120]  the millions hundreds of billions hundreds of millions of chickens are
[39:45.120 --> 39:51.480]  eating every month in this country and most of them are produced by three big
[39:51.480 --> 39:55.480]  chicken producers Tyson chief among them number one chicken producer in the
[39:55.480 --> 40:00.000]  world Tyson no and he got the laws passed where he didn't really have to have
[40:00.000 --> 40:05.000]  clean healthy meat he could just radiate it really bad for the nutrition of it
[40:05.000 --> 40:13.680]  linked to all sorts of problems but so what the big three producers of chicken
[40:13.680 --> 40:19.320]  got the laws passed where they can spray live viruses fact Google that form
[40:19.320 --> 40:22.280]  have been mentioning that the last few weeks people won't believe it Google
[40:22.280 --> 40:28.360]  viruses sprayed on me it'll pull up Reuters and AP I want to just read that
[40:28.360 --> 40:33.280]  headline when you bring it to me thanks so they can spray viruses that are
[40:33.280 --> 40:38.600]  basically a vaccine to kill bacteria but then they've done studies on all the
[40:38.600 --> 40:44.440]  other viruses and RNA and DNA for that matter from the tissue they're growing
[40:44.440 --> 40:50.360]  these viruses on dead monkeys dead babies got big tanks of dead babies dead
[40:50.360 --> 41:02.400]  monkeys stall milled up churned up and then they grow these viruses on it and
[41:02.400 --> 41:09.880]  then a bunch of other viruses and micro plasms breed but as long as this the
[41:09.880 --> 41:16.040]  slime they create has them the one virus in it that eats the bacteria they're
[41:16.040 --> 41:24.120]  happy and it's called in Latin flesh eating bacteria or flesh eating virus
[41:24.120 --> 41:35.360]  excuse me that eats the bacteria so they spray this flesh eating virus on to
[41:35.360 --> 41:43.160]  your meat there it is viral meat spray ABC news that's a good one to have maybe
[41:43.160 --> 41:48.760]  folks will believe ABC news exist FDA ok's bacteria eating virus exact
[41:48.760 --> 41:53.480]  headline I told you to treat meat preparation targets microbes that kill
[41:53.480 --> 41:58.880]  hundreds of people a year absolutely don't have meat inspectors anymore
[41:58.880 --> 42:05.000]  they've cut back on those they allow them now to pump water into beef and
[42:05.000 --> 42:10.440]  chicken so you're paying for water that was illegal for 100 plus years they
[42:10.440 --> 42:20.160]  allow them to spray viruses on the meat they allow them to radiate everything
[42:21.800 --> 42:31.320]  and Tyson chicken and others get one tag per hundred thousand chickens one tag
[42:31.320 --> 42:37.840]  per building that's kind of like once you make more than five million dollars a
[42:37.840 --> 42:44.040]  year your taxes drop way down but they tell all these you know average poor
[42:44.040 --> 42:48.120]  people out there we're gonna get the rich people we're gonna tax people making
[42:48.120 --> 42:53.440]  over 125 thousand dollars a year a piece or 250 per couple hey that's the tiny
[42:53.440 --> 42:57.120]  middle class that actually comes in your restaurant and buys your buys the
[42:57.120 --> 43:01.320]  food you know you see these waitresses and people that have an attitude against
[43:01.320 --> 43:05.960]  the kind of nouveau riche yuppies that come in and buy food and buy wine and buy
[43:05.960 --> 43:10.720]  fancy shoes because because the average person making thirty thousand dollars a
[43:10.720 --> 43:13.560]  year twenty five thousand dollars a year they think somebody making a hundred
[43:13.560 --> 43:17.240]  thousand dollars a year is rich and there's all this class envy the media
[43:17.240 --> 43:26.080]  hypes up no that's the middle class that gives you a job and so the ultra rich
[43:26.080 --> 43:31.920]  are busy waging war against the middle class shutting it down and then you're
[43:31.920 --> 43:44.240]  not gonna have a good job anymore see how that works and now we see Obama's
[43:44.240 --> 43:54.800]  tax plan it's hundreds of new taxes on everybody everyone everybody he lied on
[43:54.800 --> 44:00.280]  that too didn't he but as they implode the economy they're gonna beat the drum
[44:00.280 --> 44:04.800]  and say let's tax the rich meanwhile most that tax money's taken and given as
[44:04.800 --> 44:12.160]  banker bailout money oh by the way I forgot this article I forgot to go over
[44:12.160 --> 44:23.080]  it I'm sorry I apologize it's here in my stack wait I guess that didn't print
[44:23.080 --> 44:29.000]  but I hit print on that guys go to prison planet and info wars for me it's in
[44:29.000 --> 44:37.440]  the top stories it's a 23 trillion you see the last banker bailout numbers we
[44:37.440 --> 44:45.200]  had was two and a half months old and it was 14.8 and I said at current spending
[44:45.200 --> 44:49.840]  you in two months when they announced two numbers it should be above 20 trillion
[44:49.840 --> 44:57.880]  yes it's 23 trillion and change there's the headline cost of bailouts hits a
[44:57.880 --> 45:09.040]  whopping 24 trillion dollars that according to CNBC but that's coming up
[45:09.040 --> 45:14.120]  next hour I'm gonna get back to your calls right now now to the fellow called
[45:14.120 --> 45:21.320]  in scared about black helicopters you know I see this a lot I'm Alex Jones I
[45:21.320 --> 45:25.720]  mean I'm kind of the biggest guy in the anti-new order movement and conspiracy
[45:25.720 --> 45:31.480]  whatever you want to call it in alternative reality or in simply pointing
[45:31.480 --> 45:38.560]  out the hypocrisy and I've had some harassment and some things happen and
[45:38.560 --> 45:41.840]  then I just said I don't care do whatever gonna do to me and all went away
[45:41.840 --> 45:45.160]  because the only other option they've got is to set me up for something I
[45:45.160 --> 45:51.320]  haven't done or kill me harassment doesn't work on me audits don't work being
[45:51.320 --> 45:55.840]  beat up doesn't work being threatened doesn't work it doesn't work I'm
[45:55.840 --> 46:01.040]  committed pulling a return my whole life everything I am spiritually
[46:01.040 --> 46:07.080]  physically is invested in fighting evil I am far beyond driven far past
[46:07.080 --> 46:18.480]  committed my entire soul isn't just committed to this fight my soul is this
[46:18.480 --> 46:30.720]  fight and so when you stop caring you stop getting harassed now that said
[46:32.520 --> 46:37.360]  still occasionally different branches of the new world order who the left hand
[46:37.360 --> 46:40.360]  I don't know what the right hand's doing they'll do a test harassment and I
[46:40.360 --> 46:44.440]  always enjoy them I always enjoy it and it gives me energy and helps me get up
[46:44.440 --> 46:50.840]  in the morning so that goes away but more often than not people who are in
[46:50.840 --> 46:55.440]  rural areas think black helicopters are after them because they'll be a
[46:55.440 --> 46:58.320]  listener to this show or listen another show and they'll see helicopter over
[46:58.320 --> 47:02.800]  their house and flying around on their 10 acres or whatever everybody gets that
[47:02.800 --> 47:07.400]  visit you can be a bush loving neocon Obama loving communists you can be a
[47:07.400 --> 47:14.120]  new world order lover everybody and you can be a cop and you own 20 acres in
[47:14.120 --> 47:17.080]  another agency doesn't know that they're gonna come fly over your property
[47:17.080 --> 47:21.440]  looking for marijuana plants because they get to take your property and move
[47:21.440 --> 47:27.640]  into it if they find dope and they're looking for heat exhaust ports off
[47:27.640 --> 47:31.800]  your house off gassing heat from grow lamps they're looking for the
[47:31.800 --> 47:38.360]  residents of grow lamps everybody gets that visit so what happens by extension
[47:38.360 --> 47:42.400]  is you visit info wars dot com or prison planet dot com folks tens of millions
[47:42.400 --> 47:46.920]  people visit the sites every week now it's insane how big they are
[47:46.920 --> 47:50.680]  everybody's not getting a black helicopter visiting visits my site
[47:50.680 --> 47:55.480]  everyone is getting a black helicopter visit they fly in grids they fly over
[47:55.480 --> 47:58.960]  every piece of property my parents have three and a half acres the middle of
[47:58.960 --> 48:04.720]  Austin every month or so helicopter flies over looks around for marijuana
[48:04.720 --> 48:09.800]  plants flies around resonancing the house violating the fourth amendment
[48:09.800 --> 48:14.200]  courts have said they can't do it they do it they don't care but they're not
[48:14.200 --> 48:19.480]  doing it because they're the new world order there to come suck your blood out
[48:19.480 --> 48:24.720]  there to a you know abduct you and take you to the mothership that is they're
[48:24.720 --> 48:29.080]  not overtly doing it for the new world order you know to intimidate you because
[48:29.080 --> 48:33.200]  you're at a new order it's all part of the new world order that everybody's
[48:33.200 --> 48:37.800]  under surveillance all right that said let's go to more calls so this guy you
[48:37.800 --> 48:41.080]  know since he's exposing and telling people about how they're using sewage
[48:41.080 --> 48:46.680]  on the crops and then he sees helicopters of course you see helicopters in in
[48:46.680 --> 48:52.600]  rural areas and in growth areas and in plant areas they got helicopters flying
[48:52.600 --> 48:57.040]  over the city parks in the more remote areas I can't tell you how many times
[48:57.040 --> 49:00.120]  years ago when I had time to hike two or three times a week and the green belts
[49:00.120 --> 49:04.000]  tens of thousands of acres the cities have stolen you know more and more they're
[49:04.000 --> 49:07.360]  building on it but the stolen property you still hike on it you know that they
[49:07.360 --> 49:13.080]  stole from people before they build on it and you know I remember several times
[49:13.080 --> 49:19.360]  having a helicopter fly over and look at me or one of the DEA or army
[49:19.360 --> 49:25.320]  helicopters the army helps the local police fly around look for pot it's all
[49:25.320 --> 49:30.160]  part of merging the military and police you can even Google army helping police
[49:30.160 --> 49:34.120]  look for marijuana and you'll see hundreds of news articles that's what it
[49:34.120 --> 49:41.880]  is they're not flying over your house because you're anti-New World Order so
[49:41.880 --> 49:45.760]  see there's a fine line here of paranoia yes the New World Order is
[49:45.760 --> 49:51.880]  enslaving us folks if you want something to worry about if you want
[49:51.880 --> 49:55.560]  something where they're getting you where they're attacking you the vaccines
[49:55.560 --> 50:00.320]  the GMO food the sodium fluoride and other chemicals in the water but see
[50:00.320 --> 50:04.960]  that's done compartmentalized there's less than 10 big companies authorized
[50:04.960 --> 50:09.360]  and certified through this certification process the feds have because they
[50:09.360 --> 50:13.360]  lobby the cities and counties to pass the laws and then they also lobby the
[50:13.360 --> 50:19.080]  action plan of the of the chemicals they put in your water the people at the
[50:19.080 --> 50:23.560]  water plant don't know what they're doing most the people at the companies
[50:23.560 --> 50:27.800]  where they're mining the stuff out of the ground the chemicals and where
[50:27.800 --> 50:31.520]  they're mixing the toxic waste from aluminum production and fertilizer
[50:31.520 --> 50:35.400]  production they don't know it's compartmentalized you want to look for
[50:35.400 --> 50:40.840]  where you're being attacked it's anything unified and standardized that's
[50:40.840 --> 50:45.920]  where they're getting because it's a very small group of people carrying out
[50:45.920 --> 51:01.840]  this whole thing okay all right we're gonna take more calls stay with us

[54:32.480 --> 54:43.000]  ahead Dino hey Alex go ahead well I just disagree with some of the approaches you
[54:43.000 --> 54:48.160]  take the way you deliver the information I've been listening to you since 2002 so
[54:48.160 --> 54:53.960]  obviously I support you I listen to Joyce the power hour and Derry Brown
[54:53.960 --> 54:58.000]  very good for them there's all these different ways that people deliver
[54:58.000 --> 55:00.880]  information I mean I don't I'm not trying to be mean here but I don't make
[55:00.880 --> 55:05.040]  you listen I don't also I don't claim to have all the answers here buddy I mean
[55:05.040 --> 55:09.760]  I'm just a free human being covering what's happening and going over what's
[55:09.760 --> 55:13.920]  happening trying to shake people awake right of it real quick I'm not your
[55:13.920 --> 55:18.800]  buddy pal but that's just a joke but seriously I just want to say that you're
[55:18.800 --> 55:23.400]  doing a good job I think we need to concentrate less on fear and reaction
[55:23.400 --> 55:27.840]  right now Americans need to hold their ground stand strong and get away from
[55:27.840 --> 55:32.640]  the New World Order that's an easy ground run over here we're getting run over
[55:32.640 --> 55:37.240]  here by the globalist the average person still sucking their thumb walking
[55:37.240 --> 55:42.120]  around like it's all a big party agree with the information obviously but Joyce
[55:42.120 --> 55:46.640]  the other day had some guy on there talking about overpopulation I called
[55:46.640 --> 55:50.400]  her and I said geez this guy is talking about overpopulation the world's not
[55:50.400 --> 55:54.160]  overpopulated look at Google Earth there's partly any people on the damn
[55:54.160 --> 55:57.880]  planet we need more people we need to promote people we need to meet our
[55:57.880 --> 56:02.080]  neighbors and talk to our friends about this information and maybe perhaps maybe
[56:02.080 --> 56:07.200]  listen to Alex Jones a little less maybe just two days a week I was on five
[56:07.200 --> 56:11.600]  and six days a week for six years here you're a great color I appreciate the
[56:11.600 --> 56:20.080]  weirdo weirdo call let's listen to Alex a little bit less that's that's a good
[56:20.080 --> 56:30.640]  idea look I understand there's an innate subconscious frustration with
[56:30.640 --> 56:35.640]  hearing me get up here and get angry and get serious and maybe you should be
[56:35.640 --> 56:42.000]  listening a little less sir because if you think the way you contribute is

[1:02:21.920 --> 1:02:27.120]  what's on your mind there have you ever heard of Immanuel Velikovsky he wrote
[1:02:27.120 --> 1:02:32.200]  in the 50s and 60s about a you wrote from a different perspective on earth
[1:02:32.200 --> 1:02:37.480]  history and stuff anyway he was he was excused from basically being a
[1:02:37.480 --> 1:02:42.080]  scientist by the scientific community who was bought and paid for it in my
[1:02:42.080 --> 1:02:46.480]  opinion and he writes about that I was wanting to talk about the one specific
[1:02:46.480 --> 1:02:51.320]  book he wrote about called mankind in amnesia which was actually one I
[1:02:51.320 --> 1:02:58.720]  haven't read but it it addresses what I understand it addresses a collective
[1:02:58.720 --> 1:03:03.760]  amnesia that people actually choose to forget pains in history they forget the
[1:03:03.760 --> 1:03:09.840]  no that's it they tend to put up with them and submit to them and rationalize
[1:03:09.840 --> 1:03:15.440]  them but that's only when you can kind of mesmerize or trick or put somebody
[1:03:15.440 --> 1:03:20.000]  under a spell or a trance then once they're under that they'll put up once
[1:03:20.000 --> 1:03:24.640]  they're broke back once they're under the thumb the change has come you're

[1:08:20.200 --> 1:08:41.400]  Alex Jones
[1:08:41.400 --> 1:08:47.360]  Jim in Oklahoma you're on the air welcome sir thank you Alex how are you
[1:08:47.360 --> 1:08:53.640]  today good buddy what's on your mind okay question I will not accept president
[1:08:53.640 --> 1:09:00.440]  Obama is our president because I saw him stand up there and take an oath to
[1:09:00.440 --> 1:09:06.560]  defend and support the Constitution in the United States and he is not
[1:09:06.560 --> 1:09:09.840]  qualified to be president well no kidding
[1:09:09.840 --> 1:09:17.360]  I heard this before this is picky Unish I know but I just cannot accept the fact
[1:09:17.360 --> 1:09:23.320]  because he was not either one of those either one of the requirements of the
[1:09:23.320 --> 1:09:30.640]  Constitution he is not president in my eyes well one of the two reasons you're
[1:09:30.640 --> 1:09:38.400]  saying he's not president well the thing about it is he was born in in Kenya
[1:09:38.400 --> 1:09:48.720]  Mombasa Kenya right and what is that is it is it I'm being too picky Unish
[1:09:48.720 --> 1:09:56.760]  about this or what is it I just cannot understand these guys take a note they
[1:09:56.760 --> 1:10:04.960]  they very well know the generalities of the Constitution and to stand up there
[1:10:04.960 --> 1:10:11.160]  and make that statement knowing full well that what he's what he's saying is a
[1:10:11.160 --> 1:10:16.360]  lie you know I mean what the heck I hear you I appreciate the call I don't think
[1:10:16.360 --> 1:10:19.280]  that's the first time we've heard that he's born in Kenya and I think that's
[1:10:19.280 --> 1:10:23.840]  been beat to death I don't know whether he was born in Kenya or not the
[1:10:23.840 --> 1:10:27.360]  evidence begins to lean the way that he actually was born in Kenya and that it's
[1:10:27.360 --> 1:10:36.200]  all a big cover-up he put out a receipt of birth and will not release his birth
[1:10:36.200 --> 1:10:40.480]  certificate and has gone to great lengths to not release it and then African
[1:10:40.480 --> 1:10:44.640]  newspapers report he was born there his grandmother tells news cameras he was
[1:10:44.640 --> 1:10:53.400]  born there it doesn't really I mean it matters but it's been used as a
[1:10:53.400 --> 1:10:58.000]  political diversion from the fact that he's lied about everything he said he
[1:10:58.000 --> 1:11:07.600]  would do but he is a dissimilar a deceiver a liar a spinner and the the
[1:11:07.600 --> 1:11:14.040]  sickest point is people have somehow gotten to the position where they just
[1:11:14.040 --> 1:11:20.640]  accept that politicians lie they just accept that oh that's the way it is see
[1:11:20.640 --> 1:11:24.800]  we've capitulated oh they just they steal property and they still land and
[1:11:24.800 --> 1:11:29.160]  they run checkpoints and they spy on us without warrants and they they come in
[1:11:29.160 --> 1:11:33.960]  our houses without warrants and this is just what they do and oh yeah the
[1:11:33.960 --> 1:11:37.320]  politicians are all crooks but what are you gonna do I like this crook or I like
[1:11:37.320 --> 1:11:41.600]  that crook I like this crook cuz cuz she's Hispanic and I'm Hispanic or I
[1:11:41.600 --> 1:11:45.400]  like this crook cuz he's white and I'm white or I like this crook cuz he's
[1:11:45.400 --> 1:11:49.400]  black and I'm black and seeing a corrupt system they love to make it about
[1:11:49.400 --> 1:11:55.640]  tribalism about religion or about sex or about what color somebody is are they
[1:11:55.640 --> 1:12:01.280]  male and female you know what group is it so everything's about the group instead
[1:12:01.280 --> 1:12:06.840]  of everybody being treated equal and they're being a rule of law and so
[1:12:06.840 --> 1:12:10.800]  that's why it's all about racial politics you know they had a radio show
[1:12:10.800 --> 1:12:18.500]  got canceled here in Austin it was on 590 a.m. in the morning because the show
[1:12:18.500 --> 1:12:26.760]  was all about comedy and being tongue and cheek and making jokes about racial
[1:12:26.760 --> 1:12:34.040]  stuff which is actually by and large more healthy than not obsessing over it
[1:12:34.040 --> 1:12:41.280]  all day but see see Margaret Sanger can say kill black babies and the blacks are
[1:12:41.280 --> 1:12:45.240]  subhuman and Ruth Bader Ginsburg can say we need abortion to get rid of
[1:12:45.240 --> 1:12:48.880]  certain undesirable poor groups and minority groups and that's liberal oh
[1:12:48.880 --> 1:12:55.320]  how smart kill the blacks oh how loving oh and all the liberal groups are for it
[1:12:55.320 --> 1:12:58.760]  and then you know they've paid off the different African-American and Hispanic
[1:12:58.760 --> 1:13:03.560]  groups to be for carbon taxes in local carbon controls in their communities and
[1:13:03.560 --> 1:13:07.880]  oh Planned Parenthood so liberal she actually killing black babies and
[1:13:07.880 --> 1:13:13.800]  Mexican babies that's good that's a loving liberal sweetie cake thing but oh
[1:13:13.800 --> 1:13:22.040]  my goodness of a local radio show starts telling jokes making fun of racist
[1:13:22.040 --> 1:13:34.320]  about Hispanics they've got to be fired it's mind control it's people trained to
[1:13:34.320 --> 1:13:47.160]  be into pettiness trained to be into garbage and so
[1:13:52.000 --> 1:13:58.280]  it's just a nation of idiots I tune into talk radio I read op-ed pieces and
[1:13:58.280 --> 1:14:02.520]  they're always covering distractions and diversions or or issues that don't
[1:14:02.520 --> 1:14:10.440]  matter or they do cover an issue that gets into some real substance they
[1:14:10.440 --> 1:14:16.040]  they're wrong about the issue and you've got a bunch of dumbed-down shallow
[1:14:16.040 --> 1:14:24.520]  stupid people and they're tailor-made to be taken advantage of the problem we've
[1:14:24.520 --> 1:14:28.400]  got is those of us that are intelligent are informed our energetic our
[1:14:28.400 --> 1:14:32.840]  entrepreneurs stick we got a problem because the elite have got a giant
[1:14:32.840 --> 1:14:37.240]  horde of dumbed-down fluoride heads that'll do anything for big Macs and
[1:14:37.240 --> 1:14:40.440]  iPods and they're going to use them as a weapon and they're going to put them in
[1:14:40.440 --> 1:14:44.960]  uniforms and they're going to gang rape us so we got to stand up against them and
[1:14:44.960 --> 1:14:49.440]  inform as many people that are awake now because it'll only take five ten
[1:14:49.440 --> 1:14:53.360]  percent of a standing up but these parasites to be driven off because
[1:14:53.360 --> 1:14:57.320]  parasites are cowardly they're stupid they're weak they'll act tough and they'll
[1:14:57.320 --> 1:15:01.480]  wear fancy black uniforms and give themselves all sorts of titles and
[1:15:01.480 --> 1:15:06.720]  they'll strut around and but but when push comes to shove they fold when push
[1:15:06.720 --> 1:15:10.480]  comes to shove they fold because they're weak in the knees they got a weak
[1:15:10.480 --> 1:15:28.080]  chin all right let's go ahead and talk to mark in New York mark her on the air
[1:15:28.080 --> 1:15:32.240]  yeah Alex first of all thanks for being my friend and I hope you accept to be
[1:15:32.240 --> 1:15:37.760]  mine too and I know how you're into uh American Indian history and I picked up
[1:15:37.760 --> 1:15:41.240]  my Lakota not a lot a little bit I mean I know I don't want to claim some expert
[1:15:41.240 --> 1:15:44.360]  on that but I have read quite a few history books on it it's very interesting
[1:15:44.360 --> 1:15:48.640]  but I did a little research because I picked up the Lakota coins thanks to you
[1:15:48.640 --> 1:15:52.360]  and I was wondering what the Constitution meant by enemies foreign and
[1:15:52.360 --> 1:15:59.480]  domestic so I picked up the Federalist papers thank to you and Hamilton
[1:15:59.480 --> 1:16:03.720]  number 24 right it's only a sentence give me a second the savage tribes of our
[1:16:03.720 --> 1:16:08.880]  Western frontier ought to be regarded as natural enemies their natural allies
[1:16:08.880 --> 1:16:13.720]  because they have because they have most to fear from us and most to hope from
[1:16:13.720 --> 1:16:19.200]  them under Grant when we had a depression he sent the army out to go into
[1:16:19.200 --> 1:16:24.880]  the Black Hills which was treaty to the Indians massacred some of them and took
[1:16:24.880 --> 1:16:31.720]  their gold away Alex okay and and that squad ended up getting I think it was
[1:16:31.720 --> 1:16:36.320]  12 medals of honor at the killing 103 Indians 93 of them were women and
[1:16:36.320 --> 1:16:41.360]  children and they called it the 7th cow and the 7th cow was actually the first
[1:16:41.360 --> 1:16:46.960]  squad to go in Vietnam as well in 1965 and it just amazes me what we did to
[1:16:46.960 --> 1:16:52.040]  the Indian and the World War two-day draft that I'm for the code and if it
[1:16:52.040 --> 1:16:55.320]  wasn't for that code that they still can't break till this day who knows
[1:16:55.320 --> 1:17:01.600]  where we'd be well it's another example of what governments will do to people and
[1:17:01.600 --> 1:17:05.480]  if you think the globalist care about the American people whether they be
[1:17:05.480 --> 1:17:10.960]  Native American German Jewish Chinese if you think the globalist care about you
[1:17:10.960 --> 1:17:15.800]  once until a more than they cared about the Native Americans which they were
[1:17:15.800 --> 1:17:21.200]  said were savages to be exterminated there were British Army manuals on how
[1:17:21.200 --> 1:17:27.200]  to give them smallpox blankets that they're over 250 years old you got
[1:17:27.200 --> 1:17:32.520]  another thing coming the elites don't just see us as cheap our lives is cheap
[1:17:32.520 --> 1:17:38.880]  they see them as negatives that it's positive to kill us and that's stated by
[1:17:38.880 --> 1:17:42.600]  their United Nations biological diversity assessment 96 by State
[1:17:42.600 --> 1:17:48.320]  Department of Random 200 by the White House Science Czar's own textbook I mean
[1:17:48.320 --> 1:17:53.440]  you turn over any rock or any other writings randomly walk into a biology
[1:17:53.440 --> 1:17:57.400]  department if there's a university near you randomly go talk to the head of the
[1:17:57.400 --> 1:18:00.760]  biology department because the heads are always into this if you talk to a
[1:18:00.760 --> 1:18:04.760]  regular biologist you might get a different opinion I'd say 70% of the
[1:18:04.760 --> 1:18:07.920]  time you go talk to a biologist they'll say yeah there's too many of us we got
[1:18:07.920 --> 1:18:12.880]  to have eugenics get rid of people at about 95 or at least 90% of the time
[1:18:12.880 --> 1:18:17.320]  you go to the biology department head and it'll be a eugenicist just walk up
[1:18:17.320 --> 1:18:22.000]  to him in the cafeteria hey doctor whatever it is tell me what you think
[1:18:22.000 --> 1:18:26.080]  about the earth and its population and so they're everywhere they're in every
[1:18:26.080 --> 1:18:32.400]  position of power they mean business I appreciate your cold I mean think of the
[1:18:32.400 --> 1:18:37.880]  power trip they're on think of how they they know they're winning and they are
[1:18:37.880 --> 1:18:43.360]  gonna go on winning because the people are in a trance and so they're gonna go
[1:18:43.360 --> 1:18:47.440]  on sticking stuff in your food sticking stuff in your water they're gonna
[1:18:47.440 --> 1:18:52.680]  continue as you get diabetes and cancer and and become sterile or semi-sterile
[1:18:52.680 --> 1:18:57.360]  says they made the decision to make everybody semi-sterile so that it's a
[1:18:57.360 --> 1:19:01.840]  very very very very very hard to get somebody pregnant so women are almost
[1:19:01.840 --> 1:19:08.520]  sterile men are almost sterile on average 87% reduction in sperm count in
[1:19:08.520 --> 1:19:13.560]  the last 20 years in the United States England and Europe and then they go out
[1:19:13.560 --> 1:19:17.480]  and do test of Amish people double-blind studies and find they're not
[1:19:17.480 --> 1:19:25.320]  having a sperm count drop drink your water drink it down there you go take
[1:19:25.320 --> 1:19:32.120]  the medicine it's for your own good these chicken neck power freaking control
[1:19:32.120 --> 1:19:37.720]  freaking scientist enjoy it they love looking at you at church and in the
[1:19:37.720 --> 1:19:45.280]  airport knowing they're running a soft kill on you it's disgusting and I for

[1:25:14.480 --> 1:25:19.640]  of Lexington it's called bluegrass station it's where they have their L3
[1:25:19.640 --> 1:25:24.080]  communications does all the communications for pretty much the
[1:25:24.080 --> 1:25:28.760]  whole military for past three months we've been observing they've been
[1:25:28.760 --> 1:25:33.640]  bringing in Humvees left and right left and right left and right we didn't know
[1:25:33.640 --> 1:25:37.640]  what they were doing there's also a field logic center up just above the hill
[1:25:37.640 --> 1:25:41.200]  of us where they do reinforcement they haven't been going there they've been
[1:25:41.200 --> 1:25:48.880]  going to L3 well the place that I work we did a delivery to the L3 so I don't
[1:25:48.880 --> 1:25:54.840]  really want to say this but I do have the videotape of us going in to behind
[1:25:54.840 --> 1:25:59.040]  the secured fence and I suppose about what's supposed to be doing this but I
[1:25:59.040 --> 1:26:04.440]  have it and when I actually got inside as far as the eye could see of these
[1:26:04.440 --> 1:26:09.400]  Humvees being installed installed with technology that you would like it was
[1:26:09.400 --> 1:26:15.160]  being set up for police cars so I asked the lady I said what's the deal with all
[1:26:15.160 --> 1:26:19.160]  the Humvees she was like oh you know people just need them and I was like
[1:26:19.160 --> 1:26:24.480]  well what average American needs a military Humvee with a computer and new
[1:26:24.480 --> 1:26:29.520]  communication systems but he and I kind of just kept walking along and I was
[1:26:29.520 --> 1:26:34.240]  like look like somebody's get ready for martial law and the ladies just like
[1:26:34.240 --> 1:26:39.000]  we can edit the video where they don't know who you are or you should edit it
[1:26:39.000 --> 1:26:42.920]  where you think it's safe and get it uploaded immediately but this isn't your
[1:26:42.920 --> 1:26:48.960]  opinion I remember 10 months ago they had the headline homeland brigade starts
[1:26:48.960 --> 1:26:54.680]  tour in October right along the time that Congress was being threatened with
[1:26:54.680 --> 1:26:58.280]  physical martial law they didn't go along with it and it states they're
[1:26:58.280 --> 1:27:02.040]  gonna have army and Marines ruling America and they're gonna have check
[1:27:02.040 --> 1:27:05.160]  points and they're gonna run your license and if you're on the list you're
[1:27:05.160 --> 1:27:09.160]  going to a death camp and these guys for their paycheck will do it in a second
[1:27:09.160 --> 1:27:13.920]  because the feds are gonna be staging bombings and terror attacks saying that
[1:27:13.920 --> 1:27:18.280]  the American people are doing it and they'll kill cops and put it on the news
[1:27:18.280 --> 1:27:22.000]  the dead cops land all over the ground the cops will just go absolutely ape on
[1:27:22.000 --> 1:27:28.120]  the public and because it's all about being savage and macho and evil and
[1:27:28.120 --> 1:27:32.680]  cool and it's just gonna be a giant bloodbath at least that looks like where
[1:27:32.680 --> 1:27:37.360]  it's going now now describe who L3 is what the company is what you witnessed
[1:27:37.360 --> 1:27:45.120]  okay L3 is a communications company that does all the private military if the
[1:27:45.120 --> 1:27:48.280]  guy that was scared of helicopters they're in and out of here and then the
[1:27:48.280 --> 1:27:52.160]  the aerosol copters the ones that they parrot not parachute but the ones that
[1:27:52.160 --> 1:27:58.040]  they propelled down out of and they've been coming in and out in and out in and
[1:27:58.040 --> 1:28:02.720]  out well we would when you go into L3 it's armed guarded inside of blue grad
[1:28:02.720 --> 1:28:07.760]  station another separate part of it and you can get on blue grad station just
[1:28:07.760 --> 1:28:10.480]  the security gate but to get through there you got to go through this full
[1:28:10.480 --> 1:28:17.720]  security check or we went in the warehouse but had to be 50,000 to 100,000
[1:28:17.720 --> 1:28:23.320]  square foot just one section and when you go in the warehouse you as far as I
[1:28:23.320 --> 1:28:28.600]  could see are these Humvees to the left and even a little all-terrain vehicles
[1:28:28.600 --> 1:28:33.720]  as well like ATVs or the even like the two buggy ones like a arctic cat those
[1:28:33.720 --> 1:28:38.080]  as well into the right the whole wall was full of the computers systems that
[1:28:38.080 --> 1:28:42.280]  they were installing on the Humvees and next to them was the the type that they
[1:28:42.280 --> 1:28:46.400]  put in squad cars yeah it was I mean that's what they were preparing them

[1:33:19.560 --> 1:33:28.560]  I am the man of constant sorrow
[1:33:28.560 --> 1:33:35.200]  We're going to go live at PrismPlanet.tv starting the next segment last two
[1:33:35.200 --> 1:33:40.200]  hours and ten minutes and then I'm gonna start going to those video clips I see
[1:33:40.200 --> 1:33:45.120]  these kind of stories every day there's one where there's 50 million to this
[1:33:45.120 --> 1:33:49.040]  group to start environmental carbon taxes in their area and a million to that
[1:33:49.040 --> 1:33:53.600]  group and 500,000 to this group they're just buying everybody off that's why
[1:33:53.600 --> 1:33:57.760]  every major corporation company community group they're all getting on
[1:33:57.760 --> 1:34:03.000]  board pushing quote sustainability and a lot of it sounds reasonable like I was
[1:34:03.000 --> 1:34:06.400]  looking at the current issue of National Geographic this morning and it was how
[1:34:06.400 --> 1:34:12.480]  to grow gardens on the roofs of buildings sounded great but then it was
[1:34:12.480 --> 1:34:16.880]  oh we need to set the precedent to make it the law you have to do this and then
[1:34:16.880 --> 1:34:20.560]  that becomes a form of tyranny and allows them to regulate and control and
[1:34:20.560 --> 1:34:25.160]  once that precedent said it's over and oh we want to have sustainability in our
[1:34:25.160 --> 1:34:29.800]  forest sounds reasonable what does that really mean it means total control by
[1:34:29.800 --> 1:34:35.480]  offshore banks that have bankrupted this nation by design so big news blitz
[1:34:35.480 --> 1:34:39.720]  coming up in the next segment a bunch of different video clips I want to play I
[1:34:39.720 --> 1:34:44.080]  want to play a news clip so it's not just me saying it cost of bailout hits a
[1:34:44.080 --> 1:34:49.700]  whopping 24 trillion I'm sorry I got that wrong in the first hour I said 23
[1:34:49.700 --> 1:34:55.120]  trillion it's 24 sorry it's worse than I said FDA okay's bacteria eating virus
[1:34:55.120 --> 1:34:59.880]  is to treat meat I mentioned that so I want to go over that story and I've got
[1:34:59.880 --> 1:35:04.200]  a bunch of other articles here as well we haven't even gotten to yet but going
[1:35:04.200 --> 1:35:10.400]  back to D in Kentucky D so you were in this facility making a delivery and
[1:35:10.400 --> 1:35:13.920]  they were getting all these Humvees ready for martial law I mean that's
[1:35:13.920 --> 1:35:19.880]  already confirmed that they're going to have tens of thousands well they already
[1:35:19.880 --> 1:35:26.320]  do of regular Army patrolling America and part of the acclimation process of
[1:35:26.320 --> 1:35:32.960]  all of this is to have them running checkpoints in every major US city and
[1:35:32.960 --> 1:35:37.760]  other federal forces already doing that but that's why we see the press releases
[1:35:37.760 --> 1:35:41.480]  of all the armies out with Homeland Security running checkpoints in Tennessee
[1:35:41.480 --> 1:35:47.680]  and the governor says stop that they say no or oh a highway patrol press release
[1:35:47.680 --> 1:35:50.960]  the Marines are going to be out assisting officers at checkpoints
[1:35:50.960 --> 1:35:56.880]  countywide and then the news calls and says isn't that illegal and Marines say
[1:35:56.880 --> 1:36:01.320]  oh we're not doing it now and then you because Marines are meant to lie to
[1:36:01.320 --> 1:36:05.960]  enemies forces it's part of Cyop and then the news shows up and there are the
[1:36:05.960 --> 1:36:12.040]  Marines and then they call the Marine commander he says you didn't see that
[1:36:12.040 --> 1:36:17.320]  because this is Cyops you don't tell the Iranians when you parachute in and
[1:36:17.320 --> 1:36:21.400]  plant bombs on a bridge and then get extracted out at the border five miles
[1:36:21.400 --> 1:36:28.960]  away you don't you don't tell an enemy you're putting deadly brain-eating
[1:36:28.960 --> 1:36:32.680]  chemicals in their water supply to make them submit you hit them and you hit them
[1:36:32.680 --> 1:36:39.840]  hard you hit them well haha it's so enjoyable to have the slaves taking it
[1:36:39.840 --> 1:36:44.440]  so well oh they're taking it we'll give them more than take them to a new depth
[1:36:44.440 --> 1:36:50.160]  of and bondage and enslavement train them break them make them submit to the
[1:36:50.160 --> 1:36:54.600]  foreign banks with little potbellied globalists running at all there's
[1:36:54.600 --> 1:36:59.680]  nothing a scum won't take we're gonna give it all to them that's the attitude
[1:36:59.680 --> 1:37:04.320]  so they're gonna take your family farm and ranch you just watch and if you don't
[1:37:04.320 --> 1:37:09.560]  like it the SWAT teams I'll kill you dead it's always done with an excuse oh
[1:37:09.560 --> 1:37:15.680]  well you didn't pay the tax you got into environmental violations you will submit
[1:37:15.680 --> 1:37:20.240]  to the officers and they're gonna take your factory they're gonna take your
[1:37:20.240 --> 1:37:24.080]  business and they're gonna take your kids and I see the stories every day
[1:37:24.080 --> 1:37:27.520]  where families for no reason have their children taken and they cry about it and
[1:37:27.520 --> 1:37:31.760]  they beg and say this is America I'm supposed to have due process and they

[1:39:26.360 --> 1:39:30.920]  power trips all with their fake confidence games and their fake quiet
[1:39:30.920 --> 1:39:34.360]  demeanor and and how quote nothing affects them and they don't care about
[1:39:34.360 --> 1:39:38.440]  society and they just sit there like parasites you need to go into the fire
[1:39:38.440 --> 1:39:41.640]  to your pieces of crap
[1:39:43.160 --> 1:39:47.480]  I'm sorry D in Kentucky anything else about this facility how how many Humvees
[1:39:47.480 --> 1:39:51.480]  did you see how many Humvees per facility and of
[1:39:51.480 --> 1:39:54.600]  course you were asking the locals and about it and then
[1:39:54.600 --> 1:39:57.480]  they didn't realize what was going on around them they were just what totally
[1:39:57.480 --> 1:40:01.160]  mind down I've you know they could have my totally
[1:40:01.160 --> 1:40:05.560]  been playing it up playing it off in my opinion that's what I think you know
[1:40:05.560 --> 1:40:09.160]  because I mean they're not supposed to resist I mean this is a military
[1:40:09.160 --> 1:40:12.520]  facility that I mean it took week we had to get special clearance went to a
[1:40:12.520 --> 1:40:15.560]  special search special waivers to get us through
[1:40:15.560 --> 1:40:19.880]  and when I asked the question it was more like
[1:40:19.880 --> 1:40:23.960]  it tried to void anymore because you're American scum if you would have been a
[1:40:23.960 --> 1:40:27.560]  foreign intelligence group you would have been allowed into the
[1:40:27.560 --> 1:40:30.440]  Pentagon highest security without even signing in
[1:40:30.440 --> 1:40:34.440]  because you are the enemy buddy hell I mean
[1:40:34.440 --> 1:40:39.880]  there's a factory by where my office is and they make people take their shoes
[1:40:39.880 --> 1:40:42.120]  off and search them to go in there it's all
[1:40:42.120 --> 1:40:45.800]  crap and they're going to phase in the searching and checkpoints into every
[1:40:45.800 --> 1:40:49.160]  facet of our lives I'm sorry I'm going to shut up go ahead
[1:40:49.160 --> 1:40:52.440]  well you know you you're right on Alex and what it takes
[1:40:52.440 --> 1:40:56.120]  it you know it it takes people that has a position of you
[1:40:56.120 --> 1:40:59.640]  to hear from the people that's here that's how try to do some work
[1:40:59.640 --> 1:41:03.000]  and so that when they do see something come up they'd be like on principle I've
[1:41:03.000 --> 1:41:05.000]  seen that on principle what's really going on
[1:41:05.000 --> 1:41:07.160]  maybe these people right maybe we should have listened maybe we should have
[1:41:07.160 --> 1:41:11.000]  our heads out of our hands huh but they don't realize that they don't care
[1:41:11.000 --> 1:41:14.920]  about us so what else was going on in these warehouses
[1:41:14.920 --> 1:41:19.480]  um they have been taking in I couldn't tell you what type of vehicles these
[1:41:19.480 --> 1:41:25.480]  were but we uh one day we came in there is also this is also a FEMA this is a
[1:41:25.480 --> 1:41:29.160]  FEMA site it's not an actual rec 84 but they do do a lot of
[1:41:29.160 --> 1:41:32.440]  stuff for FEMA they got the what's the name of it what's the name of this uh
[1:41:32.440 --> 1:41:37.160]  filth pit again it's called Blue Grass Station
[1:41:37.160 --> 1:41:40.840]  it's just north of Lexington Kentucky just outside of a little town called
[1:41:40.840 --> 1:41:48.520]  Avon all right go ahead and and uh I mean they do all kinds of
[1:41:48.520 --> 1:41:53.240]  stuff for what they they brought I mean like it had to be as far as I could see
[1:41:53.240 --> 1:41:56.840]  this railroad track of these military truck liner
[1:41:56.840 --> 1:42:00.840]  vehicles like the they pulled them in on trains
[1:42:00.840 --> 1:42:04.120]  and as far as you could see that there were they I mean it looked like these
[1:42:04.120 --> 1:42:06.680]  things who were getting prepared for something
[1:42:06.680 --> 1:42:10.200]  I mean it I mean for people to think that we're getting ready to invade
[1:42:10.200 --> 1:42:13.720]  North Korea with the with Humvees and these
[1:42:13.720 --> 1:42:17.000]  huge military vehicles they're crazy you know
[1:42:17.000 --> 1:42:20.760]  if they were getting ready to run into Iran people just got nuclear power
[1:42:20.760 --> 1:42:25.720]  they're gonna just try to overrun them on the ground people are crazy
[1:42:25.720 --> 1:42:29.960]  they're out of their minds I mean this is I mean this is totally
[1:42:29.960 --> 1:42:33.240]  what would look for somebody to be preparing
[1:42:33.240 --> 1:42:40.360]  for like a massive riot a united states riot occupying will they admit
[1:42:40.360 --> 1:42:43.960]  that uh they're getting ready for civil unrest and total destruction
[1:42:43.960 --> 1:42:48.360]  see they shut the economy off then they say give us unlimited money we'll turn
[1:42:48.360 --> 1:42:51.720]  it back on they take the 24 trillion it's got 24 trillion
[1:42:51.720 --> 1:42:55.240]  hoard it for themselves and they got unlimited money to buy off all the

[1:45:27.960 --> 1:45:32.440]  hi um I just had a question actually about vaccines
[1:45:32.440 --> 1:45:35.640]  um I'm starting school in August and they're telling me that I need
[1:45:35.640 --> 1:45:39.480]  documentation showing that I've taken the mmr
[1:45:39.480 --> 1:45:43.160]  yeah there's no law you have to take shots at those schools and they know
[1:45:43.160 --> 1:45:47.000]  there's a waiver form for it they're just absolutely criminal
[1:45:47.000 --> 1:45:51.560]  murdering scum we have to start taking this for what it is a lying
[1:45:51.560 --> 1:45:56.840]  scumbag facility claiming you can't go to their stupid school to learn how to
[1:45:56.840 --> 1:46:00.120]  be a slave without having all their shots when they
[1:46:00.120 --> 1:46:04.280]  know there's no law it's a stinking regulation that they
[1:46:04.280 --> 1:46:08.760]  then demand a waiver form and and we have to I mean when I
[1:46:08.760 --> 1:46:12.040]  hear them all over the news to schools about to start going it's the law take
[1:46:12.040 --> 1:46:15.800]  the shots you're going to be arrested and I know it's going to kill and maim
[1:46:15.800 --> 1:46:20.040]  and screw up those kids and how many parents I know have called me that
[1:46:20.040 --> 1:46:23.480]  didn't listen and gave their kids shots and then they're basically retarded
[1:46:23.480 --> 1:46:27.160]  it just makes me sick I'm sorry Christina go ahead and tell me what
[1:46:27.160 --> 1:46:31.320]  else is going on so I just need to basically get like a waiver do I do
[1:46:31.320 --> 1:46:36.760]  do I get that a doctor or like how do I do that the scumbag filth
[1:46:36.760 --> 1:46:40.680]  that's what they are lying larseness worms who get federal money
[1:46:40.680 --> 1:46:43.960]  for injecting you with the sterilization compounds
[1:46:43.960 --> 1:46:47.640]  uh of course they don't know that compartmentalized slugs I'm sorry go
[1:46:47.640 --> 1:46:50.040]  ahead I feel like I've taken it before though
[1:46:50.040 --> 1:46:52.920]  because they're saying that I should have taken it when I was like 12 months
[1:46:52.920 --> 1:46:56.760]  old so I'm like I'm not going to take something I've already apparently taken
[1:46:56.760 --> 1:47:00.680]  before I just can't show the documentation because my doctor is dead
[1:47:00.680 --> 1:47:04.920]  so I really just don't know where to go next but I guess I'll just be fine
[1:47:04.920 --> 1:47:08.040]  number one ma'am they want you to take meningitis and a hundred other deadly
[1:47:08.040 --> 1:47:12.760]  shots okay uh you're calling from Alabama
[1:47:12.760 --> 1:47:16.920]  yeah well I mean Alabama's the place they got caught injecting black men with
[1:47:16.920 --> 1:47:19.800]  cephalus letting them die over 45 years they ran a bunch of other secret
[1:47:19.800 --> 1:47:22.680]  experiments there with radiation so I wouldn't be taking anything the
[1:47:22.680 --> 1:47:27.000]  university system tries to give you um there is no law you've got to take it to
[1:47:27.000 --> 1:47:31.480]  be in school you tell them I am a religious uh uh
[1:47:31.480 --> 1:47:34.760]  objector and they ask for more tell say look you're supposed to give me a form
[1:47:34.760 --> 1:47:40.280]  they also have conscientious objectors in Alabama and so vaccine waiver forms
[1:47:40.280 --> 1:47:43.560]  Alabama you send it to the health department the school's
[1:47:43.560 --> 1:47:46.200]  supposed to give you the stinking form and you just send it in and that's the
[1:47:46.200 --> 1:47:48.280]  end of it but then they know to track you and
[1:47:48.280 --> 1:47:51.240]  watch you and that you don't have them there's been court cases where how do
[1:47:51.240 --> 1:47:54.440]  you have to have a form for something that isn't even a law well it's their
[1:47:54.440 --> 1:47:59.720]  policy so so see it's all done through corporate fraud
[1:47:59.720 --> 1:48:04.040]  but is this a community college or a state college yeah it's a state college
[1:48:04.040 --> 1:48:07.080]  I mean what I mean I mean look what do you even go I'm not saying you shouldn't
[1:48:07.080 --> 1:48:10.040]  go to college I mean there are some uses in engineering and a few of the things
[1:48:10.040 --> 1:48:13.080]  but all you do is go into debt to these criminal groups
[1:48:13.080 --> 1:48:16.920]  you know most universities are just fronts they're just a facade
[1:48:16.920 --> 1:48:20.520]  for offshore corporations and most the money gets sent to investments
[1:48:20.520 --> 1:48:24.920]  I mean take UT they got over 50 something billion in offshore accounts separate
[1:48:24.920 --> 1:48:27.560]  from their budget it's not part of the pensions anything
[1:48:27.560 --> 1:48:31.400]  they keep raising rates they get half the oil and gas money
[1:48:31.400 --> 1:48:35.560]  in the state of texas they own big sports teams radio networks
[1:48:35.560 --> 1:48:38.920]  it's just all a big scam ma'am I mean why do you want to give money to these
[1:48:38.920 --> 1:48:42.920]  to these scumbag filthy bankers so they can just take the money
[1:48:42.920 --> 1:48:46.760]  I mean what are you going to school for to be a nurse or something
[1:48:46.760 --> 1:48:50.600]  well I mean I was leaning towards something like that but I I really don't
[1:48:50.600 --> 1:48:53.720]  know I just need a direction I mean I'm 25 years old I
[1:48:53.720 --> 1:48:57.480]  I don't I don't have a degree I know I don't want to give money to these people
[1:48:57.480 --> 1:49:00.760]  but I can't be going from crappy job to crappy job
[1:49:00.760 --> 1:49:03.880]  you know what I mean I mean I understand and I mean I was thinking nursing
[1:49:03.880 --> 1:49:07.400]  because there is a shortage in that because everybody's going to be basically
[1:49:07.400 --> 1:49:11.080]  dead or dying soon with all the vaccines and water they're drinking
[1:49:11.080 --> 1:49:14.360]  so I mean you can go work in that you know facility of death
[1:49:14.360 --> 1:49:18.520]  but I mean there are still a lot of good nurses and people so you can go and
[1:49:18.520 --> 1:49:22.280]  I mean that that is actually a good job to get a profession
[1:49:22.280 --> 1:49:25.080]  but you can't really be a carpenter anymore because the illegal aliens took
[1:49:25.080 --> 1:49:28.760]  all those jobs and I just know a lot of people
[1:49:28.760 --> 1:49:34.440]  that go get degrees who end up working at the grocery store bag and groceries
[1:49:34.440 --> 1:49:38.840]  but well look you don't have to take the vaccine you don't have to take the shot
[1:49:38.840 --> 1:49:41.400]  like like they tell medical workers they've got to take it
[1:49:41.400 --> 1:49:46.280]  my dad hadn't had shots in forever and you know he's a dentist I mean
[1:49:46.280 --> 1:49:50.920]  look it's all lies it's all fraud even if you think vaccines are good and I'm
[1:49:50.920 --> 1:49:53.000]  not saying you're saying that but other people
[1:49:53.000 --> 1:49:56.520]  why are they lying and saying you have to take it
[1:49:56.520 --> 1:50:00.600]  yeah exactly I won't let them do it so I'm sorry I'm ranting at you I'm just
[1:50:00.600 --> 1:50:04.760]  really in a bad mood you're fine I so appreciate everything you do Alex I
[1:50:04.760 --> 1:50:07.400]  really do well I appreciate you and it's good to hear from me

[2:02:49.960 --> 2:02:54.280]  because they wanted very little opposition and media from all of them
[2:02:54.280 --> 2:02:58.520]  you know mainstream local outlets were there but
[2:02:58.520 --> 2:03:01.560]  we actually managed to get a really good question in
[2:03:01.560 --> 2:03:07.480]  despite all of the other questions that they had
[2:03:07.480 --> 2:03:15.080]  uh cathleen uh few syllabus uh the head of the health and human services

[2:09:01.960 --> 2:09:05.880]  going to boss you they're going to control you but the last caller we're
[2:09:05.880 --> 2:09:09.160]  about to go back to was talking about he was at an event with the health and
[2:09:09.160 --> 2:09:11.880]  human services secretary who is a belterberg group member
[2:09:11.880 --> 2:09:15.240]  exposing out the feds want to federalize everything and then the police
[2:09:15.240 --> 2:09:18.360]  they were handing out pocket constitutions the obama's
[2:09:18.360 --> 2:09:22.360]  event and talking about the belterberg group were coming up and shaking their
[2:09:22.360 --> 2:09:27.640]  hand because the police are waking up
[2:09:27.640 --> 2:09:30.920]  there's three things either cops are good men and women they wake up and
[2:09:30.920 --> 2:09:33.800]  realize what's happening because they're right in the middle of it
[2:09:33.800 --> 2:09:37.320]  or they're really stupid and don't understand what they're part of and kind
[2:09:37.320 --> 2:09:41.880]  of go along with it or they're evil and know what they're part of
[2:09:41.880 --> 2:09:47.480]  but that's it those three groups and it's our job to reach out to the ignorant
[2:09:47.480 --> 2:09:49.640]  ones the ones that are kind of under a spell
[2:09:49.640 --> 2:09:52.360]  or in a trance so they can see what's happening but
[2:09:52.360 --> 2:09:57.640]  finish up john and louisiana with the story you were telling
[2:09:57.640 --> 2:10:03.240]  well uh before before i went to the event i did my research on
[2:10:03.240 --> 2:10:07.080]  all the people that were there we had uh tom bill sack the department of

[2:10:34.680 --> 2:10:38.520]  and um department of agriculture tom bill sack
[2:10:38.520 --> 2:10:44.280]  the uh former iowa governor uh made two rewards to a monsanto which i'm sure
[2:10:44.280 --> 2:10:49.560]  you're aware of monsanto yes monsanto yes
[2:10:49.560 --> 2:10:57.000]  but i i did my research but uh she she was answering most of the questions
[2:10:57.000 --> 2:11:00.360]  because now this meeting she was there pushing the president's
[2:11:00.360 --> 2:11:05.720]  health care takeover plan yes okay but you say that when you mentioned
[2:11:05.720 --> 2:11:10.360]  bill berger or one of your group did but there were gasping the audience
[2:11:10.360 --> 2:11:14.040]  yes there was gasping the audience i even heard some boos when she which you
[2:11:14.040 --> 2:11:19.480]  mentioned it's a uh international group of european and american
[2:11:19.480 --> 2:11:25.880]  business and political officials oh wait wait wait wait wait wait wait sir just
[2:11:25.880 --> 2:11:30.360]  tell the story in a nutshell you mean she got confronted about bill de berg and
[2:11:30.360 --> 2:11:36.120]  talked about it yes briefly she briefly explained what bill de berg was
[2:11:36.120 --> 2:11:40.680]  and the people boo said she did attend and that governor rick perry
[2:11:40.680 --> 2:11:44.200]  she didn't say that whether he attended but she said that he was invited
[2:11:44.200 --> 2:11:47.480]  but she said at the end of it uh you could
[2:11:47.480 --> 2:11:51.320]  it wasn't very that that clear but if you listen in really well
[2:11:51.320 --> 2:11:55.720]  it's okay and that was okay appreciate your call keep up the good work there
[2:11:55.720 --> 2:11:58.680]  good to hear from you
[2:11:59.800 --> 2:12:03.880]  let's go ahead and take another call now
[2:12:05.080 --> 2:12:12.120]  let's go ahead and talk to mark in oregon mark you're on the air
[2:12:12.120 --> 2:12:17.080]  hello alex yes go ahead yeah great to have you back
[2:12:17.080 --> 2:12:20.120]  alex uh you mentioned on a recent show that you'll
[2:12:20.120 --> 2:12:24.680]  soon become active in the formation of organizations and groups
[2:12:24.680 --> 2:12:29.960]  and that you would be moving away from the video informational realm and to the
[2:12:29.960 --> 2:12:34.920]  organizational realm and could you would you give some
[2:12:34.920 --> 2:12:38.840]  specifics about what you plan to do in this new venture and what you envisioned
[2:12:38.840 --> 2:12:43.000]  for it well i was saying that i've
[2:12:43.000 --> 2:12:46.280]  thought about not focusing so much on films
[2:12:46.280 --> 2:12:51.000]  and more on creating organizations but then you need a film for the
[2:12:51.000 --> 2:12:56.120]  organizations to give out i mean to go out and actively fight the eugenicist
[2:12:56.120 --> 2:12:59.320]  and to go out and tell people it's not the law you don't have to take vaccines
[2:12:59.320 --> 2:13:03.080]  and to really get aggressive the only problem is then i wouldn't
[2:13:03.080 --> 2:13:07.800]  have the funds to fund organizations or even the setting up of them
[2:13:07.800 --> 2:13:10.920]  and then they launch co until pro against your organization if you try to
[2:13:10.920 --> 2:13:13.480]  create some tax-free thing then they have their
[2:13:13.480 --> 2:13:16.200]  operatives come in and say oh you're spending the money on something you
[2:13:16.200 --> 2:13:19.560]  shouldn't you know even if it's for legal defense
[2:13:19.560 --> 2:13:23.240]  we really have a childlike not serious population
[2:13:23.240 --> 2:13:29.320]  almost designed to sabotage themselves um but i kind of put that idea out there
[2:13:29.320 --> 2:13:31.960]  for other people to start organizations and
[2:13:31.960 --> 2:13:36.040]  other people to go out and warn folks about eugenics what i'm saying is last
[2:13:36.040 --> 2:13:39.000]  week as i realized more and more kind of brainstorming on air
[2:13:39.000 --> 2:13:43.800]  that eugenics is everything that that that mindset and that system and
[2:13:43.800 --> 2:13:47.640]  that that's what the planetary government is that's what it's set up to do
[2:13:47.640 --> 2:13:50.840]  and here it is verified in the textbook written by the
[2:13:50.840 --> 2:13:58.200]  white house uh science czar saying that i mean it's real
[2:13:58.200 --> 2:14:03.560]  and that's the big issue and i need to do everything i can to reach out to
[2:14:03.560 --> 2:14:07.720]  people on that subject but uh
[2:14:07.720 --> 2:14:10.840]  you know mainly it's a frustration because there's so much going on there's
[2:14:10.840 --> 2:14:16.120]  so much happening and i just want to
[2:14:16.120 --> 2:14:19.640]  beat these people i mean it's so obvious what they're doing it's so
[2:14:19.640 --> 2:14:23.640]  evil it's so out in the open it's so ridiculously
[2:14:23.640 --> 2:14:28.760]  classically tyrannical and corrupt and bad i appreciate your call mark um
[2:14:28.760 --> 2:14:32.520]  there isn't any idea formed on that i mean i can barely get my cameras to work
[2:14:32.520 --> 2:14:35.880]  in here you know i i'm i'm very frustrated i spend most
[2:14:35.880 --> 2:14:39.480]  of my time messing with taxes and employees and
[2:14:39.480 --> 2:14:43.240]  light bulbs and carrying the trash out and the same crap everybody else does
[2:14:43.240 --> 2:14:47.880]  are broken water heaters and then i'm the biggest best there is and that
[2:14:47.880 --> 2:14:53.720]  isn't very good the end of the day i'm i'm not that good
[2:14:53.720 --> 2:14:57.640]  and um the global is to organize they're corrupt they're a bunch of thieving
[2:14:57.640 --> 2:15:02.920]  parasites they use our money against us
[2:15:02.920 --> 2:15:06.120]  and it's um
[2:15:06.120 --> 2:15:09.560]  people are waking up though a lot of good things are happening and so i should
[2:15:09.560 --> 2:15:13.640]  be more positive i just have trouble looking at obama
[2:15:13.640 --> 2:15:17.400]  and trouble looking at bush and and looking at all these local criminals
[2:15:17.400 --> 2:15:21.080]  and looking at all the stuff they do i'm sick of them
[2:15:21.080 --> 2:15:24.280]  i have more than a hatred for them i have a disgust
[2:15:24.280 --> 2:15:28.680]  a disdain a um
[2:15:28.680 --> 2:15:35.960]  a tectonic tightness explosive
[2:15:35.960 --> 2:15:40.760]  anathema they are anathema it's not even that i hate them or disgust it i want
[2:15:40.760 --> 2:15:45.880]  to be away from them i don't like them i don't like looking at them i don't like
[2:15:45.880 --> 2:15:49.960]  hearing them i don't like all their tics and all their enjoyment of petty power
[2:15:49.960 --> 2:15:54.360]  i hate their worldliness i hate their pettiness i hate the fact that they
[2:15:54.360 --> 2:15:57.960]  don't enjoy beauty or decency or honor
[2:15:57.960 --> 2:16:07.000]  or
[2:16:07.000 --> 2:16:10.600]  see i start thinking about them and they just it just the image of them
[2:16:10.600 --> 2:16:15.240]  starts going into my mind and that and that's something i can't allow
[2:16:15.240 --> 2:16:18.520]  i know these people i know what makes them tick i've looked into their minds
[2:16:18.520 --> 2:16:21.240]  i've studied them i know who they are and i just
[2:16:21.240 --> 2:16:25.000]  can't believe we are this low to let this type
[2:16:25.000 --> 2:16:29.160]  of worthless trash run things this type of
[2:16:29.160 --> 2:16:33.880]  innocence destroying decency destroying
[2:16:33.880 --> 2:16:42.120]  oh just oh it hurts my soul folks and my spirit just rises up against them to
[2:16:42.120 --> 2:16:44.840]  just a level
[2:16:47.160 --> 2:16:50.280]  i just want to get my hands around the throats
[2:16:50.280 --> 2:16:56.680]  do we get down to the bottom line and you know they feel the same they don't
[2:16:56.680 --> 2:16:59.480]  like us they want to get their hands around our
[2:16:59.480 --> 2:17:02.520]  throats too and they are every day you drink that

[2:17:12.440 --> 2:17:17.160]  lying to us and i'm sick of it and they take our normal
[2:17:17.160 --> 2:17:21.240]  instincts of manhood and valor and honor and they twist it and use it for
[2:17:21.240 --> 2:17:25.080]  their own aims they got the best of us working for
[2:17:25.080 --> 2:17:28.520]  them it's a load of crap

[2:18:02.680 --> 2:18:06.280]  disgusting on a daily basis to wake up
[2:18:06.280 --> 2:18:11.960]  surrounded with these grown immature kids playing with technology and toys
[2:18:11.960 --> 2:18:16.440]  it's disgusting the way things have been engineered over the past 100 years in
[2:18:16.440 --> 2:18:19.800]  this country it makes me sick to look at these people
[2:18:19.800 --> 2:18:24.040]  every time it's same with you brock is on they they have sucked

[2:18:32.920 --> 2:18:36.040]  and what not to do and they've set it all up
[2:18:36.040 --> 2:18:39.800]  it's where everything is just the way it is nowadays people have a hard time
[2:18:39.800 --> 2:18:43.320]  backtracking and back engineering the truth nowadays
[2:18:43.320 --> 2:18:47.400]  it's it's sick and i was i was wondering like
[2:18:47.400 --> 2:18:52.840]  what exactly is it going to take for everyone involved in all this
[2:18:52.840 --> 2:18:57.160]  two things to pay for everything to pay for the way it's been the way it was
[2:18:57.160 --> 2:19:01.480]  set up for all the millions of people that died and suffered for nothing
[2:19:01.480 --> 2:19:06.120]  in their lives and also at the same time for it to change
[2:19:06.120 --> 2:19:09.720]  you know everybody can be informed all they want but i think these people are
[2:19:09.720 --> 2:19:14.360]  going to battle us till the very end and it's not going to be a happy
[2:19:14.360 --> 2:19:19.960]  revolution or some no exactly they are on point they are vicious they are
[2:19:19.960 --> 2:19:23.880]  wicked they love stench and death and hurting goodness i mean they really do

[2:19:45.400 --> 2:19:48.920]  to change and stay changed and get these people out of power that's my
[2:19:48.920 --> 2:19:51.160]  concern is i tell you what i'll talk about that when

[2:20:02.840 --> 2:20:06.680]  it's being reported that cyber spies from russia and china have now
[2:20:06.680 --> 2:20:10.360]  penetrated our power grid even as energy experts are reporting
[2:20:10.360 --> 2:20:14.040]  that each summer we get closer and closer to the limits of our nation's power
[2:20:14.040 --> 2:20:16.920]  grid some say that this summer's demand for electrical
[2:20:16.920 --> 2:20:21.400]  power may finally push the grid over its edge creating a cascade of power
[2:20:21.400 --> 2:20:26.040]  outages across the country putting us all in the dark are you prepared for the
[2:20:26.040 --> 2:20:30.360]  next round of storm related outages or government created blackouts have you
[2:20:30.360 --> 2:20:34.360]  ever thought about taking steps to get off the grid and generate your own
[2:20:34.360 --> 2:20:38.440]  private supply of electrical power if so this will be the most important
[2:20:38.440 --> 2:20:42.600]  information you have ever heard solar powered generators are finally
[2:20:42.600 --> 2:20:45.000]  available they have no moving parts to wear out
[2:20:45.000 --> 2:20:48.840]  or break and require absolutely no gas whatsoever
[2:20:48.840 --> 2:20:53.720]  remember the government doesn't own the sun so go to my solar backup dot com
[2:20:53.720 --> 2:20:57.400]  that's my solar backup dot com check out my solar
[2:20:57.400 --> 2:21:02.040]  backup dot com before you lose your power

[2:22:09.480 --> 2:22:13.720]  in creating the kind of world order that i think all of us would like to see
[2:22:13.720 --> 2:22:18.360]  the obama deception completely destroys the myth that obama is working for the
[2:22:18.360 --> 2:22:22.520]  best interest of the american people while obama's already fudging yeah

[2:24:16.600 --> 2:24:21.560]  to answer chat florida's question
[2:24:21.560 --> 2:24:26.600]  how do we wake people up how do we get them involved
[2:24:26.600 --> 2:24:30.680]  how do we get them to see the light
[2:24:30.680 --> 2:24:37.880]  our culture has degenerated very slowly and it's all been adopted as habits
[2:24:37.880 --> 2:24:41.320]  and the globalists take a lot of evil things and bad things
[2:24:41.320 --> 2:24:45.880]  we do naturally and they accentuate them
[2:24:45.880 --> 2:24:50.440]  they legitimize them they say it's honorable not to care about your
[2:24:50.440 --> 2:24:54.360]  neighbor honorable to not be involved
[2:24:54.360 --> 2:25:02.200]  and it's going to take people breaking out of the control mode
[2:25:02.200 --> 2:25:06.280]  it's going to take individuals realizing they're not fulfilled
[2:25:06.280 --> 2:25:10.280]  because they're not living right and they're not informed
[2:25:10.280 --> 2:25:14.200]  and their subconscious mind knows they're being scammed and lied to and
[2:25:14.200 --> 2:25:17.800]  the bad things are going on and they're not going to get
[2:25:17.800 --> 2:25:26.280]  fulfillment diving deeper into denial
[2:25:26.280 --> 2:25:31.560]  deeper into the sick culture that they're only going to get
[2:25:31.560 --> 2:25:34.200]  fulfillment
[2:25:36.440 --> 2:25:40.360]  by finding out the truth and standing up for what's good and pure and honest and
[2:25:40.360 --> 2:25:43.880]  wholesome and the globalists know that they know we're
[2:25:43.880 --> 2:25:49.800]  having a cultural crisis worldwide in this controlled high-tech society
[2:25:49.800 --> 2:25:54.440]  and all the changes that are happening and so
[2:25:54.440 --> 2:25:58.040]  they come out and say oh we need to have a green revolution to fix all this in a
[2:25:58.040 --> 2:26:01.880]  new way of life and simplicity and they say a lot of things that are
[2:26:01.880 --> 2:26:04.600]  true but then piggyback on that all of their
[2:26:04.600 --> 2:26:08.760]  tyranny and control so they have a lot of the best and
[2:26:08.760 --> 2:26:12.840]  brightest and good people working with them believing
[2:26:12.840 --> 2:26:16.920]  they're doing it for the greater good it's
[2:26:16.920 --> 2:26:20.360]  it's psychology it's sociology it's anthropology
[2:26:20.360 --> 2:26:24.520]  the establishment knows what they're doing so it takes people
[2:26:24.520 --> 2:26:28.760]  kind of breaking out of the status quo the comfort zone
[2:26:28.760 --> 2:26:32.760]  therein and seeing the bigger picture
[2:26:33.160 --> 2:26:36.680]  and because the globalists are making their move to a
[2:26:36.680 --> 2:26:40.440]  from a somewhat controlled society to a totally controlled
[2:26:40.440 --> 2:26:47.000]  feudal neosurf society people are getting uncomfortable now
[2:26:47.000 --> 2:26:50.920]  and are starting to stand up and say no but the globalists
[2:26:50.920 --> 2:26:54.840]  foresaw all of that decades ago and have been setting up a giant
[2:26:54.840 --> 2:27:00.360]  archipelago of prisons and police and surveillance and military and
[2:27:00.360 --> 2:27:05.400]  citizen surveillance squads and as they implode the economy
[2:27:05.400 --> 2:27:10.600]  there's only going to be jobs serving the system
[2:27:10.600 --> 2:27:13.400]  even if you work for a corporation it's going to be servicing a government
[2:27:13.400 --> 2:27:19.320]  contract so our society is converting to a planned
[2:27:19.320 --> 2:27:24.120]  organized highly controlled tyranny
[2:27:25.320 --> 2:27:29.960]  and so take the issue of eugenics
[2:27:30.040 --> 2:27:32.520]  i get up here on air and i read from all these textbooks and government
[2:27:32.520 --> 2:27:35.160]  documents how they want to poison the water in the air and how they want to
[2:27:35.160 --> 2:27:38.600]  sterilize us which they are doing and how they want to
[2:27:38.600 --> 2:27:42.760]  break up the families and have cps you know in the nuclear family this is
[2:27:42.760 --> 2:27:45.720]  stated policy
[2:27:47.400 --> 2:27:51.160]  in scores of government management level
[2:27:51.160 --> 2:27:58.680]  manuals and we're here now and i tell you folks uh this is for all of human
[2:27:58.680 --> 2:28:02.360]  society this has been recognized as despotism
[2:28:02.360 --> 2:28:09.480]  as the tyrant and they may try to package it up in 21st century
[2:28:09.480 --> 2:28:15.640]  bows and paper and bells and whistles but it's it's it's bad
[2:28:15.640 --> 2:28:19.560]  and so it's going to take a lot of people getting hurt by the system
[2:28:19.560 --> 2:28:23.640]  but if we don't speak out and point out what this really is
[2:28:23.640 --> 2:28:27.720]  then as the system gets more abusive people won't even be able to recognize
[2:28:27.720 --> 2:28:30.200]  that they'll get caught up in the moment
[2:28:30.200 --> 2:28:34.040]  and not see the big picture our job is just to get folks to pull back
[2:28:34.040 --> 2:28:38.760]  see the big picture not get so caught in the everyday
[2:28:38.760 --> 2:28:43.560]  grind the everyday groove of doing the same thing the same way
[2:28:43.560 --> 2:28:47.480]  that that they let life pass them by without ever thinking
[2:28:47.480 --> 2:28:51.000]  what makes human societies operate what what makes me
[2:28:51.000 --> 2:28:55.720]  want the things i want what makes me do the things i do
[2:28:55.720 --> 2:29:02.360]  so it's going to take really all i am is like a cold bucket of water on somebody
[2:29:02.360 --> 2:29:05.800]  to wake them up and i'm ham-fisted half the
[2:29:05.800 --> 2:29:10.520]  time i'm not perfect but i'm jolting people
[2:29:10.520 --> 2:29:14.680]  out of their status quo and that's what we all have to do
[2:29:14.680 --> 2:29:17.720]  you don't have to get somebody to believe exactly what you believe or to
[2:29:17.720 --> 2:29:22.040]  go out and take action immediately it's only waking them up america and the
[2:29:22.040 --> 2:29:25.080]  world need to awaken does that answer your question
[2:29:25.080 --> 2:29:29.160]  chad in florida yes yes it does i mean the one thing
[2:29:29.160 --> 2:29:32.760]  that i was pointing out was just what's is everybody gonna pay
[2:29:32.760 --> 2:29:35.800]  that's set all this up i mean i'm concerned about that
[2:29:35.800 --> 2:29:39.240]  you know well i do want to bring the global
[2:29:39.240 --> 2:29:43.880]  to justice as well but if i mean first i'm just trying to slow down their
[2:29:43.880 --> 2:29:47.560]  operation then we can beat them then we can
[2:29:47.560 --> 2:29:51.640]  bring them to justice we'll be right back
[2:29:51.640 --> 2:29:55.480]  we're on the march the empire's on the run

[2:36:27.720 --> 2:36:33.160]  walk half a mile down the road onto city property there's a local world war
[2:36:33.160 --> 2:36:37.160]  one memorial in kansas city and say we're going to arrest you
[2:36:37.160 --> 2:36:41.240]  if you don't leave and my guys could have i guess just stayed and got arrested
[2:36:41.240 --> 2:36:44.600]  but they wanted to you know get back to austin with their footage
[2:36:44.600 --> 2:36:47.960]  they've been there to interview an economist
[2:36:47.960 --> 2:36:55.560]  but i mean the point is that's tyranny so that's 1984 and the answer is 1776
[2:36:55.560 --> 2:36:58.840]  the police should be wanting political material
[2:36:58.840 --> 2:37:01.560]  they should be involved they should be there to
[2:37:01.560 --> 2:37:07.800]  guard people's first amendment and stop other people from attacking a
[2:37:07.800 --> 2:37:12.600]  demonstration but instead as you see in my
[2:37:12.600 --> 2:37:15.400]  mini film
[2:37:17.720 --> 2:37:23.720]  battle for the republic the extra one of the extras on end game blueprint for
[2:37:23.720 --> 2:37:27.080]  global enslavement has battled for the republic
[2:37:27.080 --> 2:37:31.080]  feature ret with extended interviews and footage
[2:37:31.080 --> 2:37:34.360]  the illegal aliens are doing a non-permanent demonstration
[2:37:34.360 --> 2:37:37.880]  they they're blocking traffic for hours huge
[2:37:37.880 --> 2:37:42.520]  tens of thousands uh in seattle
[2:37:43.720 --> 2:37:47.880]  some of the citizens start protesting back and the cops come over
[2:37:47.880 --> 2:37:52.120]  take the guy out of the car he's not resisting ram his head into the ground
[2:37:52.120 --> 2:37:55.880]  blood starts pouring out his eyebrows the illegal aliens come over and
[2:37:55.880 --> 2:38:00.360]  celebrate and the cops are high five of them yeah
[2:38:00.360 --> 2:38:04.360]  yeah because see you the illegal alien the invader
[2:38:04.360 --> 2:38:07.560]  helping to break down the united states bankrupt the states
[2:38:07.560 --> 2:38:12.520]  you were smiled on by the globalist but this citizen
[2:38:12.520 --> 2:38:22.520]  that dare protest back he's bad that's 1984 the answer to that is 1776
[2:38:22.520 --> 2:38:27.720]  but let's go ahead now and play hillary being introduced by richard in haas
[2:38:27.720 --> 2:38:31.960]  head of the council on farm relations and she says you know
[2:38:31.960 --> 2:38:36.600]  we get a lot of advice from you guys and she says i'm really glad there's a dc
[2:38:36.600 --> 2:38:40.120]  council on farm relations because it's closer than new york
[2:38:40.120 --> 2:38:45.960]  now the council on farm relations set up in 1921 by british intelligence
[2:38:45.960 --> 2:38:49.480]  publicly to help take over the united states as a
[2:38:49.480 --> 2:38:53.240]  Cecil Rhodes roundtable group and Cecil Rhodes bragged about it curl
[2:38:53.240 --> 2:38:59.560]  quickly wrote a book about it in 69 the head of georgetown political science
[2:38:59.560 --> 2:39:05.720]  just two weeks ago i showed you the council on farm relations website
[2:39:05.720 --> 2:39:13.560]  where it said the cfr has written obama's comprehensive immigration reform plan
[2:39:13.560 --> 2:39:18.840]  and that jet bush has written it and that obama's going to adopt it
[2:39:18.840 --> 2:39:24.600]  showing that this tyranny's bipartisan that there is no partisanship at the top
[2:39:24.600 --> 2:39:28.440]  but the cfr you have to read the cfr to see what the plan's going to say
[2:39:28.440 --> 2:39:31.640]  because congress is writing the bill now and is making it secret
[2:39:31.640 --> 2:39:35.640]  but we always know what the bill is going to say because the cfr probably
[2:39:35.640 --> 2:39:38.120]  writes
[2:39:39.400 --> 2:39:47.800]  they write close to 100 percent of big policy bills health care they wrote
[2:39:47.800 --> 2:39:52.040]  amnesty the last four times they wrote they slightly change it north american
[2:39:52.040 --> 2:39:57.640]  union sbp they wrote they wrote the greenhouse gas tax plan
[2:39:57.640 --> 2:40:01.560]  they've written the terraforming geoengineering kim trail report
[2:40:01.560 --> 2:40:06.280]  written six years ago now being adopted word for word
[2:40:06.280 --> 2:40:10.040]  what you see from them years ago word for word is then in the wall street
[2:40:10.040 --> 2:40:13.720]  journal on every issue
[2:40:13.720 --> 2:40:20.760]  they wrote the entire homeland security proposal that was then adopted word
[2:40:20.760 --> 2:40:29.160]  for word into law as this new giant bureaucracy above all federal agencies
[2:40:29.160 --> 2:40:32.760]  and it's filled with cfr members so it's a revolving door between government
[2:40:32.760 --> 2:40:37.640]  the cfr here's the cfr here's the government they just
[2:40:37.640 --> 2:40:45.240]  they enter weave themselves this is the government
[2:40:45.240 --> 2:40:48.760]  and i had to in college here rush limbaugh say it didn't
[2:40:48.760 --> 2:40:53.960]  exist and if you're a new listener no i'm not a democrat or a socialist or a
[2:40:53.960 --> 2:40:57.400]  liberal if you criticize rush limbaugh that doesn't
[2:40:57.400 --> 2:41:01.080]  mean you're automatically in the liberal conservative camp
[2:41:01.080 --> 2:41:05.400]  i'm mad at the leftist publications that said it didn't exist
[2:41:05.400 --> 2:41:09.960]  because when you boil down rush limbaugh versus a democrat pundit it's the same
[2:41:09.960 --> 2:41:12.840]  thing just different rhetoric but the same
[2:41:12.840 --> 2:41:15.400]  end game
[2:41:16.840 --> 2:41:20.600]  the issue is the cfr does exist and they brag
[2:41:20.600 --> 2:41:27.640]  everywhere everywhere that they are setting the policy
[2:41:27.640 --> 2:41:31.640]  and running this country and in in fact now that i'm thinking
[2:41:31.640 --> 2:41:37.560]  about it it's actually in end game but pull up the clip
[2:41:37.560 --> 2:41:41.160]  cheney cheney says he doesn't tell constituents about cfr
[2:41:41.160 --> 2:41:45.160]  i wanted to see he says the same thing but worse you know i don't tell my
[2:41:45.160 --> 2:41:48.520]  constituents that i was the president of the cfr
[2:41:48.520 --> 2:41:55.720]  back home in wyoming yeah back uh ten years ago
[2:41:55.720 --> 2:41:58.600]  you couldn't tell your constituents that even existed
[2:41:58.600 --> 2:42:03.160]  because you know that's a conspiracy theorist thing
[2:42:03.160 --> 2:42:08.360]  but see now that they think they've got us where they want us
[2:42:08.360 --> 2:42:12.520]  they're going ahead and announcing it all but here she is
[2:42:13.560 --> 2:42:19.240]  oh thank you very much um richard and i am delighted to be here in these new
[2:42:19.240 --> 2:42:23.400]  headquarters um i have been often to uh i guess the
[2:42:23.400 --> 2:42:27.880]  mothership in new york city uh but it's good to have an outpost of the
[2:42:27.880 --> 2:42:31.640]  council right here down the street from the state department
[2:42:31.640 --> 2:42:35.640]  we get a lot of advice from the council so this will mean i won't have as far to
[2:42:35.640 --> 2:42:39.720]  go to uh be told uh what we should be doing and
[2:42:39.720 --> 2:42:44.280]  how we should think about the future i mean richard just
[2:42:44.280 --> 2:42:48.120]  gave what that as you see that described as a and her
[2:42:48.120 --> 2:42:53.080]  posture and her words her body language is you're my boss and
[2:42:53.080 --> 2:42:58.840]  richard and haas is one of the co presidents of america
[2:42:58.840 --> 2:43:02.040]  in the power structure
[2:43:02.600 --> 2:43:06.440]  it goes basically in government circles quasi government
[2:43:06.440 --> 2:43:09.720]  federal reserve isn't government it's private neither is the cfr but they have
[2:43:09.720 --> 2:43:13.880]  government power i mean they write the real legislation the master
[2:43:13.880 --> 2:43:23.640]  legislation the master key they are the key masters
[2:43:23.640 --> 2:43:28.760]  ben bernacky then under him treasury secretary geithner
[2:43:28.760 --> 2:43:34.440]  under him richard and haas and then advising all three of those posts is
[2:43:34.440 --> 2:43:39.080]  the trilateral commission chairman and then when you go to a cfr
[2:43:39.080 --> 2:43:42.360]  meeting to cover it it's the heads of the cfr head of the
[2:43:42.360 --> 2:43:45.560]  trilateral commission head of the roll instead of international affairs
[2:43:45.560 --> 2:43:48.520]  the heads of the world's major roundtable grips
[2:43:48.520 --> 2:43:53.160]  from the top 15 20 governments are all there
[2:43:53.160 --> 2:43:58.200]  the g8s there you know these are the guys it's real funny these guys have
[2:43:58.200 --> 2:44:01.880]  stolen 20 plus trillion in the last nine months and it's
[2:44:01.880 --> 2:44:05.240]  funny to them and they're going to tax your toilet paper
[2:44:05.240 --> 2:44:10.680]  they're going to tax beef ice cream your house home inspections youth brigades
[2:44:10.680 --> 2:44:14.200]  and they're arm and up folks these people are killers
[2:44:14.200 --> 2:44:17.880]  zabignan brzezinski one of their chief advisors wrote a book two years ago
[2:44:17.880 --> 2:44:22.280]  bragging that that that his government under nexon funded
[2:44:22.280 --> 2:44:27.080]  poll pot that killed three million people or 30 percent of cambodia
[2:44:27.080 --> 2:44:32.600]  he'll pull a trigger on you in a minute they're they're funding and writing the
[2:44:32.600 --> 2:44:36.840]  cfr writes the plans for coups in third world countries
[2:44:36.840 --> 2:44:43.640]  this is a gang of murdering crooks now there's over 4 000 members of the cfr
[2:44:43.640 --> 2:44:47.320]  now the top 300 or so are murdering crooks
[2:44:47.320 --> 2:44:51.800]  an angelina joe lee or somebody you know she's going to join it
[2:44:51.800 --> 2:44:55.560]  for whatever reasons it doesn't look good though all right let's go to dick

[2:46:04.920 --> 2:46:08.680]  provides a window to the real story the speaker
[2:46:08.680 --> 2:46:12.840]  vice president dick cheney takes a question from david rocker feller
[2:46:12.840 --> 2:46:17.960]  vice president i just enjoyed so much your whole speech but i was particularly
[2:46:17.960 --> 2:46:22.680]  pleased that you gave such a strong endorsement for the free trade agreement
[2:46:22.680 --> 2:46:26.360]  for all the amorphous subject that has been of great
[2:46:26.360 --> 2:46:30.840]  concern to me for many years and particularly recently
[2:46:30.840 --> 2:46:36.040]  and i think it's absolutely essential for the strength of our economy
[2:46:36.040 --> 2:46:39.240]  rocker feller's role in the drive for an ftaa
[2:46:39.240 --> 2:46:44.280]  was a lot more central than he portrays rocker feller cultivated latin american
[2:46:44.280 --> 2:46:47.720]  leaders who could be counted on to support such a proposal
[2:46:47.720 --> 2:46:52.360]  both the 1994 miami summit and the ftaa proposal
[2:46:52.360 --> 2:46:56.680]  were conceived and nurtured by a rocker feller created network
[2:46:56.680 --> 2:47:00.360]  prominent among the organization sponsoring the miami event
[2:47:00.360 --> 2:47:04.440]  were the council of the americas founder and honorary chairman david rocker
[2:47:04.440 --> 2:47:08.840]  feller the americas society chairman david rocker feller
[2:47:08.840 --> 2:47:12.280]  the forum of the americas founder david rocker feller
[2:47:12.280 --> 2:47:16.360]  the institute for international economics financial backer and board member
[2:47:16.360 --> 2:47:19.800]  david rocker feller the trilateral commission founder and
[2:47:19.800 --> 2:47:25.080]  honorary chairman david rocker feller rocker feller's influence also extends
[2:47:25.080 --> 2:47:29.400]  to the current administration he was chairman emeritus of the cfr
[2:47:29.400 --> 2:47:32.760]  when vice president dick cheney once served as a director
[2:47:32.760 --> 2:47:37.240]  a relationship that cheney concealed during his congressional career
[2:47:37.240 --> 2:47:40.520]  it's good to be back at the council on foreign relations as uh
[2:47:40.520 --> 2:47:44.920]  pete mentioned i've been a member for a long time and was actually a director
[2:47:44.920 --> 2:47:47.960]  for some period of time i never mentioned that when i was
[2:47:47.960 --> 2:47:52.200]  campaigning for re-election back home in wyoming
[2:47:54.040 --> 2:48:01.240]  isn't it funny the slaves oh god we're robbing them
[2:48:02.520 --> 2:48:06.280]  we put out my acroports to the cops saying they're terrorist if they talk
[2:48:06.280 --> 2:48:10.040]  about us we tell the cops the vets or the
[2:48:10.040 --> 2:48:14.120]  terrorists if they talk about imaginary cfr and the best part is
[2:48:14.120 --> 2:48:19.240]  the cops are buying it god we're building fema caps
[2:48:19.240 --> 2:48:23.720]  oh it's so fun to rape them oh there's nothing this scum won't take
[2:48:23.720 --> 2:48:26.920]  yeah baby
[2:48:28.200 --> 2:48:32.520]  the best part is we're poisoning their water most of them are sterile and don't
[2:48:32.520 --> 2:48:37.960]  even don't even care 87 of them have become sterile
[2:48:37.960 --> 2:48:42.040]  and it's not even an issue with these idiots they just don't even know why
[2:48:42.040 --> 2:48:45.320]  it's happening
[2:48:45.320 --> 2:48:49.480]  and then they have hundreds of these little subgroups which mayors and
[2:48:49.480 --> 2:48:52.360]  people are part of and then the Rockefellers and the globalists because
[2:48:52.360 --> 2:48:55.400]  they steal all the tax money they sit there and fund them
[2:48:55.400 --> 2:49:00.360]  and so your mayor may only get 10-20 thousand dollars a year in a stipend
[2:49:00.360 --> 2:49:06.120]  get to fly around five or six great destinations being a five-star hotel
[2:49:06.120 --> 2:49:09.720]  just for that they'll sell your complete society out
[2:49:09.720 --> 2:49:13.240]  then the feds come in teach them how to steal property teach them how to set up
[2:49:13.240 --> 2:49:17.240]  pimp game operations that's just all the big
[2:49:17.240 --> 2:49:19.960]  joke hillary oh i come here to get told what to do

[2:50:06.440 --> 2:50:14.600]  it was 14.8 what does this mean that it's now 24 trill
[2:50:14.600 --> 2:50:18.760]  if you do the math they are accelerating the stealing
[2:50:18.760 --> 2:50:25.720]  that's 8.8 trill they've stolen in just two and a half three months
[2:50:25.720 --> 2:50:30.680]  and and and cnbc is very happy about all this oh i mean

[3:02:30.680 --> 3:02:33.320]  to read it correctly then she corrects it for 24
[3:02:33.320 --> 3:02:37.800]  trill but here she is cnbc 24 trill that you're
[3:02:37.800 --> 3:02:42.440]  going to pay and you're going to pay interest on
[3:02:42.440 --> 3:02:46.840]  you give it to the bankers and then you pay them

[3:03:12.680 --> 3:03:15.480]  president on health care and i see that you've also been
[3:03:15.480 --> 3:03:19.560]  blogging about this issue what's been used what's the tarp funds have been
[3:03:19.560 --> 3:03:22.120]  used for and we're all kind of scratching our heads about this leak
[3:03:22.120 --> 3:03:25.720]  testimony from the tarp inspector general who says that the ultimate
[3:03:25.720 --> 3:03:29.960]  government sponsorship could be 27 trillion 23 trillion dollars
[3:03:29.960 --> 3:03:34.840]  not to overstate it we had a week we had a we had a bit of a hint of this last
[3:03:34.840 --> 3:03:37.880]  week i think when when goldman reported it's
[3:03:37.880 --> 3:03:41.880]  three and a half billion dollar quarter profits we actually have a column on
[3:03:41.880 --> 3:03:45.480]  our site today the daily beast dot com by one charlie gasparino
[3:03:45.480 --> 3:03:48.520]  um... who who compares this use of tarp money
[3:03:48.520 --> 3:03:52.600]  uh... to you know essentially giving goldman in this case uh...
[3:03:52.600 --> 3:03:55.560]  a hundred bucks to go to vegas making a thousand and thanks very much you get
[3:03:55.560 --> 3:03:58.680]  your hundred back you know what we've kind of been down that road we had
[3:03:58.680 --> 3:04:02.520]  charlie on a little bit earlier but you know what to the points that we were
[3:04:02.520 --> 3:04:04.520]  making a little bit earlier on the air
[3:04:04.520 --> 3:04:08.200]  um... we have heard from a number of banks that they they are making loans
[3:04:08.200 --> 3:04:10.520]  bank of america we mentioned a few moments ago we talked to some
[3:04:10.520 --> 3:04:14.120]  community bankers who said that they are lending as well and a number of large
[3:04:14.120 --> 3:04:17.240]  other larger institutions that say they're lending and and besides who's to say
[3:04:17.240 --> 3:04:21.800]  what the tarp money ultimately should be used for what are you hearing from
[3:04:21.800 --> 3:04:24.920]  people i think that's right there's no question there's plenty of a lot of
[3:04:24.920 --> 3:04:27.080]  lending going on and this does go back
[3:04:27.080 --> 3:04:30.600]  take this takes us back uh... nine or ten months to win

[3:09:25.640 --> 3:09:29.880]  haggins as powerful and often chilling eye
[3:09:29.880 --> 3:09:34.600]  opener i'm pronouncing that paul haggis i think i'm pronouncing that right uh
[3:09:34.600 --> 3:09:40.680]  mr miller it is it's paul haggis fantastic uh listen so much to go over so
[3:09:40.680 --> 3:09:44.280]  much to cover here but whenever i look into the
[3:09:44.280 --> 3:09:47.880]  drugging of children the new freedom initiative with its own internal
[3:09:47.880 --> 3:09:51.640]  documents saying the goal is to put 50 percent of
[3:09:51.640 --> 3:09:54.840]  america's kids on psychotropic and antipsychotics
[3:09:54.840 --> 3:09:59.320]  these drugs brain damage people they admit it causes suicide and
[3:09:59.320 --> 3:10:03.720]  psychopathic uh outburst especially in people that are already prone to impulse
[3:10:03.720 --> 3:10:07.000]  control they know what they're doing and as
[3:10:07.000 --> 3:10:12.760]  society breaks down and and now they have drugs for the drugs
[3:10:12.760 --> 3:10:17.880]  uh i i've seen those ads on television so this is a bottomless pit
[3:10:17.880 --> 3:10:21.960]  it seems and the public is pretty much unaware of it so i appreciate you making
[3:10:21.960 --> 3:10:25.880]  this film well listen i you know it's great honor to be on your show and i
[3:10:25.880 --> 3:10:29.320]  know that you've been covering the topic for a long time and
[3:10:29.320 --> 3:10:32.520]  you know when you talk about experimentation that's already being done
[3:10:32.520 --> 3:10:37.480]  of course then uh the foster kids who are already in the in the worst
[3:10:37.480 --> 3:10:40.920]  situation imaginable imaginable without parents
[3:10:40.920 --> 3:10:44.680]  uh you know they're being shifted around from house to house and
[3:10:44.680 --> 3:10:50.040]  institution to institution and in california massachusetts many states
[3:10:50.040 --> 3:10:55.240]  around the country florida for one over 75 percent
[3:10:55.240 --> 3:11:00.200]  of the foster kids are already on antipsychotic medications alex so i
[3:11:00.200 --> 3:11:04.520]  mean it doesn't get much uglier than that frankly
[3:11:04.520 --> 3:11:09.000]  continue well i i think that there the the reality is that
[3:11:09.000 --> 3:11:14.040]  when you've got 75 percent of the of the most vulnerable kids
[3:11:14.040 --> 3:11:19.160]  uh on antipsychotic medications you know that there's some kind of trial going
[3:11:19.160 --> 3:11:23.240]  on they're dumbing down people and frankly you know this is what we're
[3:11:23.240 --> 3:11:27.400]  putting uh another you know 10 million or so kids
[3:11:27.400 --> 3:11:31.240]  who are diagnosed as quote bipolar disorder
[3:11:31.240 --> 3:11:36.200]  that's the exact uh class of drugs that kids are being put on
[3:11:36.200 --> 3:11:39.880]  and so you know if it's really an ugly thing
[3:11:39.880 --> 3:11:44.040]  and it's only made uglier by the fact that our tax dollars are supporting it
[3:11:44.040 --> 3:11:48.920]  uh in florida for example uh that 75 percent of the foster kids that i was
[3:11:48.920 --> 3:11:53.560]  mentioning to you oh i think it's 55 to 58 percent of
[3:11:53.560 --> 3:11:58.360]  those are being paid for by medicare uh so it
[3:11:58.360 --> 3:12:04.360]  you know it's a it's a ridiculous heinous situation
[3:12:04.360 --> 3:12:09.400]  now when you talk about 75 percent in some states the national average
[3:12:09.400 --> 3:12:13.400]  at least when i made in game two years ago was 69 percent
[3:12:13.400 --> 3:12:18.360]  of the nation's foster children or on psychotropics
[3:12:18.360 --> 3:12:24.040]  uh and you're right that even then i saw the number of 80 percent approaching
[3:12:24.040 --> 3:12:27.880]  80 percent uh being on the drugs in some states
[3:12:27.880 --> 3:12:31.800]  and they did they did a study in texas and we even have some committee hearing
[3:12:31.800 --> 3:12:36.840]  clips in in game where the state psychiatrist says well
[3:12:36.840 --> 3:12:40.760]  it's eugenics they have bad gene pools is why we're putting
[3:12:40.760 --> 3:12:45.160]  upwards of 70 percent in the case of texas uh on them
[3:12:45.160 --> 3:12:49.240]  but as you said some states even higher i mean just let that
[3:12:49.240 --> 3:12:57.880]  sink in for the listeners out there 75 percent of foster children on
[3:12:57.880 --> 3:13:01.480]  psychotropics and antipsychotics but don't stop there
[3:13:01.480 --> 3:13:06.600]  the texas report from w o a i tv and san antonio
[3:13:06.600 --> 3:13:12.040]  itself from the state the states own numbers said they're on an average of
[3:13:12.040 --> 3:13:17.400]  seven drugs and there were medical doctors on the tv program
[3:13:17.400 --> 3:13:22.200]  that we play clips of here saying they would see a healthy kid at say three
[3:13:22.200 --> 3:13:25.000]  years old that got grabbed by foster parents
[3:13:25.000 --> 3:13:28.520]  by the system and they'd see him five years later
[3:13:28.520 --> 3:13:33.560]  in a wheelchair totally retarded not even able to speak so
[3:13:33.560 --> 3:13:37.080]  they are murdering these children with the drugs
[3:13:37.080 --> 3:13:40.360]  and you're talking about what conventional journalists are reporting
[3:13:40.360 --> 3:13:44.200]  alex and so that makes it even more shocking because we know that
[3:13:44.200 --> 3:13:49.000]  there's this uh one hand feet the other kind of attitude the mainstream media
[3:13:49.000 --> 3:13:52.120]  i mean one of the guys in my film robert whitaker
[3:13:52.120 --> 3:13:56.920]  a former science journalist who basically is he's almost blackballed he
[3:13:56.920 --> 3:14:00.760]  almost can't find a find a job in conventional journalism anymore
[3:14:00.760 --> 3:14:04.040]  because he co-wrote a series on psychiatric research
[3:14:04.040 --> 3:14:08.760]  for the boston globe and part of what he told me in the interview was that
[3:14:08.760 --> 3:14:12.680]  it's literally one out of every 70 children in the united states
[3:14:12.680 --> 3:14:17.720]  who are on antipsychotic medications alone of course the number is higher if
[3:14:17.720 --> 3:14:21.400]  you include riddling and antidepressants and the like so
[3:14:21.400 --> 3:14:26.280]  this is not a lark this isn't a fluke this is something as you say that the
[3:14:26.280 --> 3:14:30.360]  that the uh the medical doctors and the medical establishment
[3:14:30.360 --> 3:14:34.040]  sure as hell know what they're doing and it's been going on now
[3:14:34.040 --> 3:14:40.120]  pretty ardently since broad 1970 yeah this is thx 1138 this is brave new
[3:14:40.120 --> 3:14:45.480]  world and all this huxley in 62 shortly before his
[3:14:45.480 --> 3:14:48.680]  death at berkeley and folks can watch the film
[3:14:48.680 --> 3:14:52.200]  and the audio online just google all this huxley berkeley
[3:14:52.200 --> 3:14:56.520]  speech he says that hey everything in my book is
[3:14:56.520 --> 3:15:00.040]  what the eugenics social planners were planning
[3:15:00.040 --> 3:15:06.120]  in 1930 and so everything i'm saying in the book is going to come true
[3:15:06.120 --> 3:15:11.720]  after 2000 is our plan and by the way my brother runs the united nations
[3:15:11.720 --> 3:15:16.040]  unesco program as the secretary general of unesco
[3:15:16.040 --> 3:15:20.520]  these people mean business and they've now done it
[3:15:20.520 --> 3:15:24.200]  uh i'm sure you saw the new freedom initiative that came out four years ago
[3:15:24.200 --> 3:15:27.240]  when the documents got leaked where they want to
[3:15:27.240 --> 3:15:30.680]  force at least half the kids in the next phase on drugs
[3:15:30.680 --> 3:15:36.040]  and then after that everyone on drugs uh i mean this is really happening
[3:15:36.040 --> 3:15:39.480]  well i think that the you know the timing of generation rx is
[3:15:39.480 --> 3:15:43.320]  is really extraordinary because it was rolled out
[3:15:43.320 --> 3:15:48.600]  just around the same time that again our our friends our cohorts in the mainstream
[3:15:48.600 --> 3:15:53.880]  media new york times and and la times and washington post we're starting to
[3:15:53.880 --> 3:15:57.000]  reveal for the very first time that oh my god
[3:15:57.000 --> 3:16:00.920]  there's actually a collusion going on there's conflicts of interest
[3:16:00.920 --> 3:16:04.600]  there's paola going on especially when it comes to the
[3:16:04.600 --> 3:16:09.320]  uh the diagnostic and statistical manual for mental disorders this so-called
[3:16:09.320 --> 3:16:14.280]  bible for mental disorders yeah i found out that that the school nurses get
[3:16:14.280 --> 3:16:18.360]  weird kickbacks and paola and so they push it on the kids and say oh here's
[3:16:18.360 --> 3:16:21.320]  a psychologist here's a card they're just like drug
[3:16:21.320 --> 3:16:23.800]  pushers but they're not out on the playground
[3:16:23.800 --> 3:16:26.920]  selling the kids crack they're doing it in the school
[3:16:26.920 --> 3:16:30.840]  and they'll send the cops if you don't take it well what's funny is that we say
[3:16:30.840 --> 3:16:34.600]  in the film i think it's dr julian whitaker uh my good friend the medical
[3:16:34.600 --> 3:16:38.600]  doctor from los angeles and he says you know it's it's uh it's
[3:16:38.600 --> 3:16:42.040]  it's comical because the very same drugs that they
[3:16:42.040 --> 3:16:45.480]  will arrest you for if you're walking down the street in front of a school
[3:16:45.480 --> 3:16:49.080]  or what the kids in the schools themselves are lining up to get from those
[3:16:49.080 --> 3:16:52.760]  very nurses so you know you're exactly correct
[3:16:52.760 --> 3:16:55.720]  and this is not a surprise nor is it a secret
[3:16:55.720 --> 3:16:59.640]  i mean each kid gets four to five hundred dollars
[3:16:59.640 --> 3:17:03.240]  for the school itself and for the school district
[3:17:03.240 --> 3:17:07.160]  if they are on these drugs because they are classified
[3:17:07.160 --> 3:17:11.320]  uh in a certain kind of a way to get government special special needs and
[3:17:11.320 --> 3:17:14.920]  now some schools a third or more of the school special needs
[3:17:14.920 --> 3:17:19.720]  and soon it's going to be half and then just like thx 1138 pretty soon
[3:17:19.720 --> 3:17:23.240]  kids in wheelchairs with nozzles into their nose and drug
[3:17:23.240 --> 3:17:27.080]  injectors you know i mean it's so
[3:17:27.080 --> 3:17:31.080]  nightmarish the soft kill they're running and then they say it's for eugenics
[3:17:31.080 --> 3:17:35.160]  in the state of texas they say they're giving us racial hygiene
[3:17:35.160 --> 3:17:38.120]  start with the film tell us about the film because
[3:17:38.120 --> 3:17:42.360]  i really want people to get this on dvd at info wars dot com i want them to have
[3:17:42.360 --> 3:17:46.120]  viewing parties showed her local community groups school boards
[3:17:46.120 --> 3:17:49.240]  we've got to get generation rx out to people
[3:17:49.240 --> 3:17:53.000]  well thank you alex and the film really came as a result of
[3:17:53.000 --> 3:17:56.680]  uh in 2004 i was filming in washington
[3:17:56.680 --> 3:18:00.600]  something completely unintended ended up at a food and food and drug
[3:18:00.600 --> 3:18:04.440]  administration hearing where they were a bunch of people who were
[3:18:04.440 --> 3:18:09.320]  standing before the fda committee talking about the side effects of projac
[3:18:09.320 --> 3:18:13.000]  and i had that was filming over the two-hour period or whatever
[3:18:13.000 --> 3:18:16.920]  it kicked into me that my god i've heard this all before
[3:18:16.920 --> 3:18:21.800]  and it turns out that i had originally heard it in a videotape in nineteen
[3:18:21.800 --> 3:18:28.040]  from 1991 where the american citizens 40 50 60 of them were
[3:18:28.040 --> 3:18:32.520]  standing before the fda a year after projac had been on the market
[3:18:32.520 --> 3:18:37.160]  saying you know my mother stabbed my father my sister hung herself
[3:18:37.160 --> 3:18:41.640]  every imaginable awful frightening story that you can imagine
[3:18:41.640 --> 3:18:45.000]  and so when i realized that nothing had changed in that
[3:18:45.000 --> 3:18:49.320]  period of time in fact it had gotten worse and more kids had gotten on these
[3:18:49.320 --> 3:18:52.680]  medications i said nothing's changing i need to i need to
[3:18:52.680 --> 3:18:57.560]  produce a film about this and so i got started on that path
[3:18:57.560 --> 3:19:03.160]  uh and really you know uncovered all of the all of the collusion
[3:19:03.160 --> 3:19:07.400]  and certainly all the negligent and i think criminal behavior
[3:19:07.400 --> 3:19:11.320]  at the food and drug administration where of course corruption is so endemic
[3:19:11.320 --> 3:19:14.680]  as it's always been but people like thomas locker
[3:19:14.680 --> 3:19:18.520]  at the at the fda who's the head of their psychopharmacology
[3:19:18.520 --> 3:19:22.760]  division and who approved zoloft for children
[3:19:22.760 --> 3:19:27.640]  uh and michael r taylor who's back from monsanto
[3:19:27.640 --> 3:19:31.960]  after a gig at the fda in the early 1990s
[3:19:31.960 --> 3:19:35.320]  when i interviewed him and who also tried to
[3:19:35.320 --> 3:19:40.920]  eliminate dietary supplements and robert temple another fda official so
[3:19:40.920 --> 3:19:45.000]  all of these men bounding together abandoning together with the pharmaceutical
[3:19:45.000 --> 3:19:49.240]  companies to cover up the side effects and basically to
[3:19:49.240 --> 3:19:53.960]  implement their dastardly intentions on our kids
[3:19:53.960 --> 3:19:58.040]  and boy it's it's been a devastating black off and they have death education

[3:24:17.320 --> 3:24:22.440]  generation rx is our guest
[3:24:22.440 --> 3:24:25.560]  of course in the early eighties it did come out that they knew it caused
[3:24:25.560 --> 3:24:29.720]  massive increases in suicides just prozac alone
[3:24:29.720 --> 3:24:33.640]  and after decades of fighting they now admit on the prozac
[3:24:33.640 --> 3:24:37.240]  and other variants serotonin reuptake inhibitors that
[3:24:37.240 --> 3:24:42.040]  it does cause that so it's an oxymoron and nine times out of 10 with the cases
[3:24:42.040 --> 3:24:45.320]  i've seen they put them on one drug that it doesn't work they put them on two or
[3:24:45.320 --> 3:24:48.040]  three four and they end up the mental institution
[3:24:48.040 --> 3:24:51.880]  or committing suicide or going crazy or finally get off the drugs but you have
[3:24:51.880 --> 3:24:54.520]  to get them off you have to go off slowly
[3:24:54.520 --> 3:24:58.360]  or that can cause even bigger problems uh but
[3:24:58.360 --> 3:25:03.800]  now they have drugs to treat the drugs i see the tv ad saying oh you've got
[3:25:03.800 --> 3:25:07.720]  mental problems from your prozac we'll take this drug it'll take care of the
[3:25:07.720 --> 3:25:12.200]  prozac it's just totally sick
[3:25:12.200 --> 3:25:15.000]  please continue with the story you were telling about all these men working
[3:25:15.000 --> 3:25:18.200]  together to to carry out this great evil
[3:25:18.200 --> 3:25:22.040]  well i i think alex it's just that you know the medical ethics
[3:25:22.040 --> 3:25:26.360]  have just completely gone out the window if they ever existed
[3:25:26.360 --> 3:25:31.080]  they are long in the distant past by now um because
[3:25:31.080 --> 3:25:36.280]  frankly you know these men when you mentioned prozac the original study
[3:25:36.280 --> 3:25:40.120]  that we on earth then we found paperwork to track this as you know
[3:25:40.120 --> 3:25:44.920]  i mean 1982 were the first tests that were done on prozac and they
[3:25:44.920 --> 3:25:49.240]  were done in germany and the german equivalent of the fda
[3:25:49.240 --> 3:25:53.560]  basically said you know there's a real problem with this drug
[3:25:53.560 --> 3:25:57.320]  in the first trial alone 16 people tried to kill themselves
[3:25:57.320 --> 3:26:01.240]  and we're talking about 16 out of the first 43 or something
[3:26:01.240 --> 3:26:04.520]  and others attack people but that's great you put a bunch of kids on that and
[3:26:04.520 --> 3:26:07.160]  give them guns then you have an excuse to ban the second
[3:26:07.160 --> 3:26:09.640]  amendment well and you know i've heard i've been
[3:26:09.640 --> 3:26:13.640]  listening to your program for many years and i i i heard someone
[3:26:13.640 --> 3:26:17.160]  attack you once about the fact that you mentioned
[3:26:17.160 --> 3:26:20.840]  that the columbine killers and some of the other people have been on drugs
[3:26:20.840 --> 3:26:24.760]  let me just put this nonsense on the other side to rest
[3:26:24.760 --> 3:26:29.080]  once and for all it is absolutely a fact
[3:26:29.080 --> 3:26:33.080]  that at the bare minimum eight out of the last 12
[3:26:33.080 --> 3:26:37.000]  school shooters around the country were indeed on
[3:26:37.000 --> 3:26:42.840]  these antidepressant drugs it probably was at least nine out of the last 12
[3:26:42.840 --> 3:26:46.360]  but they feel the records are one of the columbine killers
[3:26:46.360 --> 3:26:51.080]  and so none of us know for certain yeah but his friends his friends said he was
[3:26:51.080 --> 3:26:55.160]  on uh ritalin and prozac but you're right that
[3:26:55.160 --> 3:26:59.160]  they sealed it and then the other one was on it that that's exactly right
[3:26:59.160 --> 3:27:02.600]  and we know that he was going to a psychiatrist so i mean
[3:27:02.600 --> 3:27:06.680]  you know how many troubled kids as you as you said before would not be
[3:27:06.680 --> 3:27:11.480]  prescribed these antidepressant drugs so you know what they started with was
[3:27:11.480 --> 3:27:16.600]  something very commonsensical they started with this with the ADHD aspect
[3:27:16.600 --> 3:27:20.440]  and they really tried to just control the kids behavior
[3:27:20.440 --> 3:27:23.560]  then all of a sudden there was a there was a problem there was a there was the
[3:27:23.560 --> 3:27:26.920]  DEA of all agencies coming out and saying wait a minute
[3:27:26.920 --> 3:27:30.680]  there's a problem with these uh with this methylphenidate with these with
[3:27:30.680 --> 3:27:34.040]  ritalin with these stimulant drugs and they're causing this
[3:27:34.040 --> 3:27:39.080]  vast array of side effects and violent side effects were among them
[3:27:39.080 --> 3:27:41.880]  and addiction problems and all the rest of it
[3:27:41.880 --> 3:27:46.120]  and so uh you know then they went into a big pr campaign
[3:27:46.120 --> 3:27:53.640]  to basically combat the the DEA uh and you know this is the mid 1990s
[3:27:53.640 --> 3:28:00.520]  and there was a 734 increase in the number of kids that were prescribed
[3:28:00.520 --> 3:28:07.560]  ritalin for quote ADHD drug from 1990 to 1994 alone
[3:28:07.560 --> 3:28:11.000]  which and then the kids that go on the ritalin
[3:28:11.000 --> 3:28:14.280]  then the kids that get on ritalin tend to get depressed so then they put them on
[3:28:14.280 --> 3:28:18.680]  prozac type drugs don't they and and then as kids start committing
[3:28:18.680 --> 3:28:21.560]  suicide and killing other people and hurting other people
[3:28:21.560 --> 3:28:25.480]  there's mental illness at the school everybody's got to be screened now by
[3:28:25.480 --> 3:28:28.920]  the new freedom and then lo and behold the psychologists find that
[3:28:28.920 --> 3:28:32.680]  everybody needs to be put on drugs well here's the crazy part of it as you
[3:28:32.680 --> 3:28:36.520]  say they put the kids on ritalin so first they start them on a lower dose
[3:28:36.520 --> 3:28:41.560]  they might be five years old or six years old or maybe even four years old
[3:28:41.560 --> 3:28:45.720]  and then after a while they they note that that same dose of ritalin doesn't
[3:28:45.720 --> 3:28:51.320]  isn't quote working the kid seems to be you know exercising his own ability and
[3:28:51.320 --> 3:28:55.480]  his own intellect so then they raise the dose well then
[3:28:55.480 --> 3:28:59.640]  then what happens is it kicks in with a side effect that's very well known
[3:28:59.640 --> 3:29:04.360]  after they raise the dose of the ritalin the child has a psychotic reaction
[3:29:04.360 --> 3:29:08.120]  so once the child has a psychotic reaction they rush the kid to the doctor
[3:29:08.120 --> 3:29:11.480]  because he's talking crazy and and he's a mile a minute and
[3:29:11.480 --> 3:29:15.080]  just can't be controlled and the doctor instead of saying oh that's a well
[3:29:15.080 --> 3:29:19.240]  known side effect of methylphenidate of ritalin we gave him too much we need to
[3:29:19.240 --> 3:29:23.000]  take him off this drug no they don't say that as you know Alex
[3:29:23.000 --> 3:29:28.120]  then they say he's bipolar now he's bipolar so now we put them on these
[3:29:28.120 --> 3:29:32.600]  powerful potent dangerous anti-psychotic drugs
[3:29:32.600 --> 3:29:37.560]  for which there is no cure and this is what we're doing to our generation rx

[3:33:25.160 --> 3:33:28.360]  but then i want to talk about solutions where this is going i mean if we don't
[3:33:28.360 --> 3:33:31.480]  expose these people and find them they're going to make everybody take drugs
[3:33:31.480 --> 3:33:35.400]  and they're now to the point of trying to make the kids take it and
[3:33:35.400 --> 3:33:39.080]  i had a writer for a psychology today calling me for some big cover story
[3:33:39.080 --> 3:33:41.880]  that's coming out soon
[3:33:42.600 --> 3:33:45.880]  and i would bring up the fact that if it's not normal to have more than two
[3:33:45.880 --> 3:33:50.360]  thirds of the kids on these drugs and he would just laugh at me i mean it's all
[3:33:50.360 --> 3:33:54.040]  just a big joke to these people it's all just a big business
[3:33:54.040 --> 3:33:59.000]  very very sickening guild i mean folks having 75 percent of kids on
[3:33:59.000 --> 3:34:02.360]  strong antipsychotics and other drugs that isn't normal
[3:34:02.360 --> 3:34:06.040]  having five percent on an abnormal somebody shouldn't be on drugs unless
[3:34:06.040 --> 3:34:08.280]  they were already trying to kill people and
[3:34:08.280 --> 3:34:11.640]  already trying to chew their fingers off or somebody shouldn't be on these
[3:34:11.640 --> 3:34:13.960]  dangerous drugs even if they think they're the pope
[3:34:13.960 --> 3:34:16.840]  you know just they're nutty and that's the end of it no
[3:34:16.840 --> 3:34:22.120]  they say all normal behavior is abnormal because it's their business model
[3:34:22.120 --> 3:34:25.320]  this is the new priesthood we're going to go back to a kevin meller here in just
[3:34:25.320 --> 3:34:28.600]  a moment with generation rx i didn't want to tell you about a few of our
[3:34:28.600 --> 3:34:32.920]  sponsors that have made today's show possible
[3:34:32.920 --> 3:34:37.000]  one of them is it is something that every one of my listeners needs to have
[3:34:37.000 --> 3:34:41.240]  i have one in my car you should have one whether it's just the
[3:34:41.240 --> 3:34:44.920]  little secret pin recorder or whether it's the a little bit more
[3:34:44.920 --> 3:34:48.360]  expensive uh in car system it's hidden cameras in your
[3:34:48.360 --> 3:34:52.520]  card in your car that you just hit a button and the camera start recording
[3:34:52.520 --> 3:34:56.680]  what the police or others are doing uh and then you've got a secret
[3:34:56.680 --> 3:35:02.440]  record of what happened and the website is diginet.net that's
[3:35:02.440 --> 3:35:11.240]  diginet.net and everybody should have
[3:35:11.240 --> 3:35:15.480]  one of the digi pins these are the best pins for the best price i've seen
[3:35:15.480 --> 3:35:19.880]  anywhere so diginet.net but i suggest and i mean to get one i've
[3:35:19.880 --> 3:35:22.760]  just been so busy i know we all are it's a very very
[3:35:22.760 --> 3:35:27.240]  affordable very inexpensive uh to get two gig four gig

[3:35:31.560 --> 3:35:36.680]  cameras going into a little uh a recorder unit and stored on a
[3:35:36.680 --> 3:35:40.360]  little memory disk just absolutely essential that we use big
[3:35:40.360 --> 3:35:45.800]  brother tools against the establishment uh in this time and date
[3:35:45.800 --> 3:35:50.120]  everybody needs to protect themselves so
[3:35:50.120 --> 3:35:53.080]  i'm thinking i have to have this on my car just when nuts show up in a parking
[3:35:53.080 --> 3:35:56.040]  lot and try to do weird stuff to me i've had that happen a few times and then
[3:35:56.040 --> 3:36:00.200]  later i drive off and hear them tell people something completely untrue
[3:36:00.200 --> 3:36:04.440]  i mean it it's just good to have this to protect yourself diginet.net
[3:36:04.440 --> 3:36:11.400]  diginet.net and finally i want to tell you about the great folks at
[3:36:11.400 --> 3:36:16.120]  Survival Seed Bank in a real crisis having non-hybrid
[3:36:16.120 --> 3:36:19.480]  seeds means having the ability to grow an endless supply of nutrient-dense food
[3:36:19.480 --> 3:36:22.280]  to feed your loved ones there have been times in american history pilgrim for
[3:36:22.280 --> 3:36:26.520]  example when seeds of the highest value of any barter item even silver or gold
[3:36:26.520 --> 3:36:30.200]  there's a war on against non-hybrid seeds waged by the global elite who wanted
[3:36:30.200 --> 3:36:32.200]  to control us by controlling the food supply
[3:36:32.200 --> 3:36:34.920]  governments are storing seeds the union is storing seeds
[3:36:34.920 --> 3:36:37.720]  globalists are very striper storing seeds in the arctic circle
[3:36:37.720 --> 3:36:41.320]  why do you think they're doing this you know why control and power
[3:36:41.320 --> 3:36:44.440]  solutions from science is trying to get the seeds out of the globalist hands
[3:36:44.440 --> 3:36:47.000]  and they're the hands of the people this is the place to get them
[3:36:47.000 --> 3:36:50.600]  Survival Seed Bank get them out of the hands of the elite and at the hands of
[3:36:50.600 --> 3:36:54.760]  the people survivalseedbank.com that's survivalseedbank.com
[3:36:54.760 --> 3:37:00.600]  or 877-327-0365 877-327-0365
[3:37:00.600 --> 3:37:05.000]  survivalseedbank.com okay going back to our guest
[3:37:05.000 --> 3:37:09.800]  uh with the film generation rx uh mr miller
[3:37:09.800 --> 3:37:13.000]  continuing where where we left off after that last break
[3:37:13.000 --> 3:37:17.000]  how they put you on the speed drugs the infetamin class
[3:37:17.000 --> 3:37:21.320]  which then everybody knows speed freaks are nuts they keep upping the dose
[3:37:21.320 --> 3:37:26.360]  uh when they stop sleeping or act weird or are up sometimes and down other times
[3:37:26.360 --> 3:37:30.200]  they don't go hey that's what speed freaks do
[3:37:30.200 --> 3:37:34.120]  causes heart palpitations heart enlargement brain shrinkage
[3:37:34.120 --> 3:37:39.800]  all these physical problems they admit no because they're a psychiatric guild
[3:37:39.800 --> 3:37:44.680]  a a drug pushing guild they don't say hey our drug did that
[3:37:44.680 --> 3:37:48.760]  the very culprit says oh yes now we put you on prozac
[3:37:48.760 --> 3:37:54.440]  please continue yeah exactly and uh once they once they have a psychotic
[3:37:54.440 --> 3:37:57.560]  reaction and they get put in an anti-psychotic medication
[3:37:57.560 --> 3:38:01.240]  they're basically is no cure at that point so
[3:38:01.240 --> 3:38:05.400]  they tell you straight up you could be 16 years old 12 11
[3:38:05.400 --> 3:38:08.200]  doesn't matter they'll tell you that you're going to be on drugs the rest of
[3:38:08.200 --> 3:38:12.120]  your life and you know this is this is one of the
[3:38:12.120 --> 3:38:17.800]  main things that uh really propelled me to produce this
[3:38:17.800 --> 3:38:21.160]  film i could see nothing beyond the murder in
[3:38:21.160 --> 3:38:25.640]  the mayhem i could see no sanity literally coming out of
[3:38:25.640 --> 3:38:30.360]  of the medical establishment or the fda or the american psychiatric
[3:38:30.360 --> 3:38:34.040]  association uh and you know you start seeing
[3:38:34.040 --> 3:38:38.520]  when you peel back the dirty layers you start seeing how many
[3:38:38.520 --> 3:38:41.560]  people who are making the decisions on these drugs
[3:38:41.560 --> 3:38:45.240]  are getting payola from the drug companies themselves
[3:38:45.240 --> 3:38:48.920]  i mean how can it be you're you know i think we're around the same age
[3:38:48.920 --> 3:38:52.280]  Alex how can it be that you know in the record company
[3:38:52.280 --> 3:38:57.400]  executives from the 70s and 80s were thrown in prison for payola for getting
[3:38:57.400 --> 3:39:01.480]  a few dollars under the table to get a record plate on on the radio
[3:39:01.480 --> 3:39:06.680]  and yet we've got uh we've got researchers and scientists and doctors
[3:39:06.680 --> 3:39:10.440]  and decision makers who are getting millions
[3:39:10.440 --> 3:39:14.280]  of dollars under the table not reporting it
[3:39:14.280 --> 3:39:18.840]  and still walking around free as a bird well let me expand on that just don't
[3:39:18.840 --> 3:39:23.640]  know separate issue but it's it's it's connects into this
[3:39:23.640 --> 3:39:29.720]  you can just google the term uh irs agents cut from billionaires
[3:39:29.720 --> 3:39:33.560]  and there's all these news articles where they got rid of almost all over 90
[3:39:33.560 --> 3:39:37.720]  percent of the corporate fraud investigators
[3:39:37.720 --> 3:39:41.160]  from the irs now you can argue is it a fair tax or not obviously that's a
[3:39:41.160 --> 3:39:45.640]  scam too but the issue is they don't enforce on billionaires
[3:39:45.640 --> 3:39:49.560]  they enforce on middle class and blue collar workers
[3:39:49.560 --> 3:39:53.800]  because the criminal class that's why it came out that more than half of
[3:39:53.800 --> 3:39:58.920]  congress doesn't even pay the taxes i mean this is an openly criminal group
[3:39:58.920 --> 3:40:02.920]  go ahead no i i couldn't agree more and and yet
[3:40:02.920 --> 3:40:06.200]  you've got a minimum this is a bare minimum
[3:40:06.200 --> 3:40:11.000]  uh done by studies uh proved by studies from boston university researchers and
[3:40:11.000 --> 3:40:14.600]  others that say that a bare minimum of 56 percent
[3:40:14.600 --> 3:40:19.240]  of the people who are on the panels that decide which drugs get dispensed to our
[3:40:19.240 --> 3:40:22.760]  children 56 percent is the minimum number
[3:40:22.760 --> 3:40:26.680]  of people who also have conflicts of interest with the drug company
[3:40:26.680 --> 3:40:29.960]  well that on some committees you're talking about
[3:40:29.960 --> 3:40:34.280]  uh the anti-psychotic drugs and schizophrenia
[3:40:34.280 --> 3:40:39.400]  groups 100 percent of the decision makers on the committee
[3:40:39.400 --> 3:40:42.920]  that are ruling on which drugs are dispensed to the general public
[3:40:42.920 --> 3:40:46.920]  100 percent of them are getting money from the drug companies
[3:40:46.920 --> 3:40:52.040]  speaker fees travel traveling events hundreds of thousands and millions of
[3:40:52.040 --> 3:40:56.840]  dollars that they then don't even declare
[3:40:56.840 --> 3:41:00.200]  to the general public that there is a conflict now
[3:41:00.200 --> 3:41:04.760]  you know in any other entity if you had conflicts of interest
[3:41:04.760 --> 3:41:09.560]  uh with Boeing and airplanes and the faa you would have to you would have to
[3:41:09.560 --> 3:41:14.200]  recuse yourself exactly right and so why isn't it
[3:41:14.200 --> 3:41:17.960]  the case with this when we are affecting the lives of our future
[3:41:17.960 --> 3:41:21.240]  future leaders in this nation the only answer
[3:41:21.240 --> 3:41:24.920]  that i can come with are two answers one is the dumbing down aspect that you
[3:41:24.920 --> 3:41:28.360]  talk about a lot and number two is just frankly just the money
[3:41:28.360 --> 3:41:31.960]  that's at risk and you know this order that we've
[3:41:31.960 --> 3:41:35.640]  always talked about it it now is reaching
[3:41:35.640 --> 3:41:38.520]  way beyond just the borders of this united states
[3:41:38.520 --> 3:41:42.280]  in the medical profession into the world trade organization
[3:41:42.280 --> 3:41:46.440]  we're tied into it through all of our trade acts nafta and casta
[3:41:46.440 --> 3:41:50.680]  and the world health organization and all these god awful things
[3:41:50.680 --> 3:41:56.120]  and sooner or later you and i and the cadre of other freedom fighters
[3:41:56.120 --> 3:42:00.360]  are going to let it be known to people in a way that they can understand and
[3:42:00.360 --> 3:42:06.520]  embrace and act on that this has to stop and it will stop
[3:42:06.520 --> 3:42:09.800]  because we're going to make it stop
[3:42:10.600 --> 3:42:15.640]  well we have to and i think people should get generation rx
[3:42:15.640 --> 3:42:19.560]  your film and have viewing parties show it to their neighbors
[3:42:19.560 --> 3:42:23.240]  we have to start getting in people's business i mean they're taking our kids
[3:42:23.240 --> 3:42:27.880]  and turning them into tattletales to spy on us and saying that's kosher
[3:42:27.880 --> 3:42:32.440]  it's normal for us to go talk to our neighbors talk to our friends
[3:42:32.440 --> 3:42:36.120]  talk to our families when i'm in an airport or a grocery store now
[3:42:36.120 --> 3:42:39.400]  well you mean i'm selfish i just want to get on my airplane
[3:42:39.400 --> 3:42:45.000]  i just want to get my food and go but i will walk over and say hey listen
[3:42:45.000 --> 3:42:48.600]  uh i uh i don't want to get in your business but i really care about
[3:42:48.600 --> 3:42:53.240]  you know your humanity or or i really care about your child's health
[3:42:53.240 --> 3:42:56.680]  they're trying to push dozens and dozens of new vaccines every year and these
[3:42:56.680 --> 3:43:00.760]  have all been proven be causing a problem just do research before you
[3:43:00.760 --> 3:43:04.280]  vaccinate your children and you don't have to take the vaccines
[3:43:04.280 --> 3:43:07.960]  and a lot of times i'll say thank you and start walking away
[3:43:07.960 --> 3:43:11.240]  and they will say because it's almost like they're thankful they can't believe
[3:43:11.240 --> 3:43:14.680]  another human is talking to them we've all been trained to not talk
[3:43:14.680 --> 3:43:18.920]  and they'll say it's not the law i didn't want to give her or him the shots but
[3:43:18.920 --> 3:43:24.600]  they said i had to and i'll say no google i go do you have a search engine yes
[3:43:24.600 --> 3:43:27.320]  you have a computer yes well well search engine
[3:43:27.320 --> 3:43:31.320]  the you know the term vaccine waiver form and then
[3:43:31.320 --> 3:43:34.840]  your state and you just got to give them that form
[3:43:34.840 --> 3:43:37.880]  and they go thank you or other times they go
[3:43:37.880 --> 3:43:41.160]  hmm and and are kind of the types that are uptight and scared and
[3:43:41.160 --> 3:43:45.720]  don't want to i don't care though i'm ready to do whatever it takes
[3:43:45.720 --> 3:43:50.040]  to go 110 to warn people because i see these little kids
[3:43:50.040 --> 3:43:53.480]  and i know what they're putting in the vaccines i know it's a eugenics program
[3:43:53.480 --> 3:43:56.600]  no matter how horrible it sounds i know the truth it's hard for me to admit
[3:43:56.600 --> 3:44:00.520]  what their own documents say and i know what the drugging is about i've seen
[3:44:00.520 --> 3:44:03.720]  them at the state level in texas say it's eugenics
[3:44:03.720 --> 3:44:08.840]  these children are subhuman and i've talked to these psychiatrists and
[3:44:08.840 --> 3:44:12.280]  psychologists they are on power trips they are
[3:44:12.280 --> 3:44:16.440]  flaming evil i mean they are bastard scum
[3:44:16.440 --> 3:44:19.800]  i'm not saying all of them but the establishment ones
[3:44:19.800 --> 3:44:23.080]  these certainly aren't your carl young or somebody like that who are pretty neat
[3:44:23.080 --> 3:44:26.360]  you know i mean it's just these corporate scum
[3:44:26.360 --> 3:44:30.280]  they're these corporate scum they're to sling rock sling dope
[3:44:30.280 --> 3:44:34.440]  sling this stuff in our kids and i'm tiredly 21st century dope pushers go
[3:44:34.440 --> 3:44:37.000]  ahead well how it's what i was gonna say is
[3:44:37.000 --> 3:44:40.680]  you know the basis of of what when you talk about young and some of the others
[3:44:40.680 --> 3:44:43.960]  well what was their foundation it was talk therapy
[3:44:43.960 --> 3:44:48.040]  i mean if we removed all of the drugs that were the psychiatric meds that
[3:44:48.040 --> 3:44:51.640]  we're giving kids right now and simply just sat down and
[3:44:51.640 --> 3:44:55.400]  talked to them or had a quote expert talk to them
[3:44:55.400 --> 3:44:59.320]  i mean 98 percent of them would be doing infinitely better than they are in
[3:44:59.320 --> 3:45:04.520]  these meds so when you're talking about you know going back to these immunosuppressants
[3:45:04.520 --> 3:45:08.200]  drugs that they're giving kids as vaccinations
[3:45:08.200 --> 3:45:12.600]  i mean even again to draw the parallel with when i was a kid we got
[3:45:12.600 --> 3:45:16.760]  what you know measles the mumps the rubella polio
[3:45:16.760 --> 3:45:20.440]  that was about it maybe chicken pox now they're on
[3:45:20.440 --> 3:45:26.440]  up to 61 52 immunosuppressants vaccinations by the time they are
[3:45:26.440 --> 3:45:32.360]  eight years old i mean how is god's name can anyone believe
[3:45:32.360 --> 3:45:36.760]  that this is beneficial to their immune system it's a sad
[3:45:36.760 --> 3:45:40.280]  sad reality not to mention then on top of it
[3:45:40.280 --> 3:45:43.560]  that the very criminals that are contaminating vaccines
[3:45:43.560 --> 3:45:49.320]  like the baxter international people uh which you know i was talking about a
[3:45:49.320 --> 3:45:52.040]  long time ago and i know you have been on the show
[3:45:52.040 --> 3:45:56.040]  you know that could have infected hundreds of thousands if not millions of
[3:45:56.040 --> 3:45:59.160]  people and could have killed literally millions of people
[3:45:59.160 --> 3:46:02.440]  they're the same people that are making the vaccinations
[3:46:02.440 --> 3:46:09.160]  for swine flu so you know again i i tried to produce the film in such a way
[3:46:09.160 --> 3:46:13.080]  so that people who had no investment in this alix whatsoever
[3:46:13.080 --> 3:46:17.240]  knew nothing about the issue could watch generation rx
[3:46:17.240 --> 3:46:21.080]  and come to a logical conclusion themselves
[3:46:21.080 --> 3:46:25.800]  about whether or not they felt that this was a same course to take
[3:46:25.800 --> 3:46:30.440]  and i try to respect the intelligence of of the people who are viewing the film
[3:46:30.440 --> 3:46:35.640]  and well you've done a masterpiece you've made a masterpiece in generation rx i
[3:46:35.640 --> 3:46:39.240]  just hope that people will start caring about their fellow humans
[3:46:39.240 --> 3:46:44.760]  and start going to the pta clubs start going to the school board meetings
[3:46:44.760 --> 3:46:49.320]  start going to city council and say stop pushing drugs
[3:46:49.320 --> 3:46:53.720]  in the schools i was a straight a student uh i wasn't
[3:46:53.720 --> 3:46:56.840]  straight a my first few years in high school but we moved out here to austin
[3:46:56.840 --> 3:47:00.120]  i was straight a made a hundred and some of my classes
[3:47:00.120 --> 3:47:08.200]  that last year to where i didn't need to uh be at school all day to finish my
[3:47:08.200 --> 3:47:13.800]  my uh course load in high school so for an hour a day they said you are a
[3:47:13.800 --> 3:47:19.720]  student aid and i was a student aid there
[3:47:19.720 --> 3:47:26.040]  and one day i didn't feel good one day i was coming down with a cold
[3:47:26.040 --> 3:47:29.000]  and i went into the nurse and i said i want to go home
[3:47:29.000 --> 3:47:33.720]  and she said you have to call your mommy and here i am 18 years old
[3:47:33.720 --> 3:47:37.000]  so i sit there and give the phone to my mom okay you can come home
[3:47:37.000 --> 3:47:40.120]  for i went out and got my car and drove home and then she goes hey if you're
[3:47:40.120 --> 3:47:43.720]  feeling bad it's like drugs it's like speed
[3:47:43.720 --> 3:47:47.160]  it's you high it's fun well first i said well no i don't want any riddling
[3:47:47.160 --> 3:47:49.800]  she said here's the name of a psychologist that was real calm at the
[3:47:49.800 --> 3:47:53.880]  time handsome good-looking clean cut or a polo shirt and slacks
[3:47:53.880 --> 3:47:56.760]  people thought i was a cop at the school at anderson because i didn't really
[3:47:56.760 --> 3:48:00.200]  hang out with anybody i kept to myself i just wanted to get out of high school
[3:48:00.200 --> 3:48:05.240]  and uh i said no no i don't i don't need that she said oh it's fun it's like
[3:48:05.240 --> 3:48:09.560]  drugs you like speed don't you and i'm like look at me lady
[3:48:09.560 --> 3:48:13.560]  i'm a jock you know i've got like two percent body fat i didn't say that but
[3:48:13.560 --> 3:48:17.800]  i didn't want it and then she kind of came on to me sexually that was a
[3:48:17.800 --> 3:48:21.240]  little added thing but i mean the issue is
[3:48:21.240 --> 3:48:25.320]  is that they're laughing it's true i mean this country screwed man
[3:48:25.320 --> 3:48:30.360]  the she came at me mr miller as a drug pusher
[3:48:30.360 --> 3:48:33.960]  well and you know one of the stories in the film that
[3:48:33.960 --> 3:48:38.120]  that that seems to expose this kind of attitude is
[3:48:38.120 --> 3:48:42.280]  what happened to matty milling downing and her daughter
[3:48:42.280 --> 3:48:46.840]  you know i mentioned about half hour ago about thomas lochrin the head of the
[3:48:46.840 --> 3:48:50.280]  psychopharmacology division at fda
[3:48:50.280 --> 3:48:57.960]  tom lochrin was his his daughters were friends with matty milling downings
[3:48:57.960 --> 3:49:03.480]  two daughters they lived in suburban dc they lived in the mariland area of course
[3:49:03.480 --> 3:49:06.120]  the fda headquarters is is right near there
[3:49:06.120 --> 3:49:09.640]  their kids had sleepovers they socialized
[3:49:09.640 --> 3:49:14.440]  all the rest of it all of this time thomas lochrin
[3:49:14.440 --> 3:49:21.240]  knew the effects of zoloft and these ssri and refused to interact with his
[3:49:21.240 --> 3:49:25.400]  good friends who by the way he knew that the daughter was the one daughter was
[3:49:25.400 --> 3:49:30.280]  just put on zoloft the drug that he had approved for children
[3:49:30.280 --> 3:49:34.440]  and he never even said anything to the downings
[3:49:34.440 --> 3:49:38.440]  and the end result was a few months later that this
[3:49:38.440 --> 3:49:42.840]  beautiful beautiful 11-year-old girl kandace downing
[3:49:42.840 --> 3:49:46.040]  hanged herself in the garage of the downing home
[3:49:46.040 --> 3:49:50.520]  one hour after watching animal planet on tv with her father sitting on her
[3:49:50.520 --> 3:49:53.880]  father's lap good god so how do we get to this
[3:49:53.880 --> 3:49:57.400]  place where you have a disconnect these people
[3:49:57.400 --> 3:50:03.880]  who are running the show in dc and who are living off of our tax dollars
[3:50:03.880 --> 3:50:08.920]  and are so inhumane that they won't share the most
[3:50:08.920 --> 3:50:14.680]  basic warning information with friends that they've been friends with for 9
[3:50:14.680 --> 3:50:17.480]  or 10 or 11 years but that's the issue with these fake
[3:50:17.480 --> 3:50:21.480]  corporate types is they're into how they don't care about anybody
[3:50:21.480 --> 3:50:23.960]  and they'd watch you drown and not even help
[3:50:23.960 --> 3:50:27.800]  they're in to the fact that their soul is scum
[3:50:27.800 --> 3:50:31.560]  well i'll tell you i think you're exactly right because i've i've watched
[3:50:31.560 --> 3:50:35.240]  dozens and dozens and dozens of hours of fda hearings
[3:50:35.240 --> 3:50:38.360]  and i've seen nothing but cold and calculation
[3:50:38.360 --> 3:50:42.120]  coming from all of the fda officials they could give a damn
[3:50:42.120 --> 3:50:45.240]  about the stories of real people who died on these beds
[3:50:45.240 --> 3:50:49.320]  well that's because the overarching geopolitical system is run by eugenesis
[3:50:49.320 --> 3:50:53.000]  so the more of us they kill the better i mean that's
[3:50:53.000 --> 3:50:56.360]  i mean in the state hearings they said that they said
[3:50:56.360 --> 3:51:01.480]  these people are subhuman they have bad gene pools we're getting rid of them
[3:51:01.480 --> 3:51:07.960]  if you owe the irs you can't make the problem go away without professional

[3:55:03.240 --> 3:55:09.800]  south flamar sweet 100 austin texas 787-04 to get generation rx a film by
[3:55:09.800 --> 3:55:14.280]  kevin p miller kevin we got about four minutes left here at the end
[3:55:14.280 --> 3:55:20.120]  tell folks more about the film because i mean it's so multifaceted it gets into
[3:55:20.120 --> 3:55:24.360]  so many areas it shows the motivation the lies what the drugs do
[3:55:24.360 --> 3:55:28.120]  the horror stories it's just amazing tell folks more
[3:55:28.120 --> 3:55:31.640]  about generation rx and how they can use it to
[3:55:31.640 --> 3:55:36.360]  stop this mass murder well i appreciate the latter part of what you just said
[3:55:36.360 --> 3:55:41.080]  because you know what i've said often in my speeches around the country
[3:55:41.080 --> 3:55:45.320]  is that um you know i made the film so that so that
[3:55:45.320 --> 3:55:48.680]  parents in particular and teachers and even sheriffs
[3:55:48.680 --> 3:55:52.840]  could be armed with the information they need and especially parents because
[3:55:52.840 --> 3:55:55.960]  you know how intimidated most parents are with
[3:55:55.960 --> 3:55:59.720]  either either by a school administrator or certainly a doctor
[3:55:59.720 --> 3:56:03.320]  were intimidated by the lab coats and their air of authority
[3:56:03.320 --> 3:56:07.640]  and yet you know it's incredible because since the film has been out
[3:56:07.640 --> 3:56:12.200]  i was speaking in in Nebraska a couple of weeks ago and a woman came up to me
[3:56:12.200 --> 3:56:16.440]  and she said you know i actually did what you suggested i used
[3:56:16.440 --> 3:56:21.000]  the information as a weapon and i said really with whom she said with the
[3:56:21.000 --> 3:56:24.600]  with my child's pediatrician and uh and
[3:56:24.600 --> 3:56:27.880]  evidently the pediatrician was just sort of dumbstruck
[3:56:27.880 --> 3:56:32.120]  had no response for the vast majority of the statistics or things that she
[3:56:32.120 --> 3:56:35.560]  cited from the film so you know i took great care to make
[3:56:35.560 --> 3:56:38.680]  sure that there was integrity in the information alex and you know how
[3:56:38.680 --> 3:56:41.720]  important that is because if there is an integrity in the
[3:56:41.720 --> 3:56:45.480]  information it makes it too easy for everybody else to shoot down
[3:56:45.480 --> 3:56:49.000]  so i would encourage people to you know buy it
[3:56:49.000 --> 3:56:53.080]  through you and to and to use the information in the film first of all
[3:56:53.080 --> 3:56:56.680]  as a weapon to defend their child and defend their communities
[3:56:56.680 --> 3:57:00.840]  and in the case of sheriffs that you know if if you get a call from the local
[3:57:00.840 --> 3:57:05.240]  school and you find out there's a there's a there's a
[3:57:05.240 --> 3:57:09.000]  you know gun standoff you might have a have some insight
[3:57:09.000 --> 3:57:12.840]  that no other sheriff in the country has on why this is going down
[3:57:12.840 --> 3:57:17.400]  so that that's part of it so i mean the film is pretty diverse i mean the
