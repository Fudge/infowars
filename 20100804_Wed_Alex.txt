[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.000 --> 00:20.800]  he's alex jones on the GCN radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[00:20.800 --> 00:33.360]  thank you for joining us it is wednesday the fourth day of august 2010 we've got a guest joining us
[00:33.360 --> 00:42.400]  coming up in the third hour we haven't had on about six months dr. michael kaufman he has the
[00:42.400 --> 00:48.800]  new book rescuing a broken america why america is deeply divided and of course he's an expert on
[00:48.800 --> 00:56.080]  the u.n biosphere agenda 21 carbon tax takeover he's a big part of my film end game blueprint
[00:56.080 --> 00:59.920]  for global enslavement and so we're gonna have him on to talk about his new book and a host of
[00:59.920 --> 01:06.800]  other important information today coming up in the third hour in the first two hours we're going
[01:06.800 --> 01:13.200]  to have wide open phones but specifically on several topics that i want to get your take on
[01:13.200 --> 01:19.600]  wide open phones anybody can call in not just first-time callers if you disagree if you agree
[01:19.600 --> 01:27.280]  that it's specifically on several topics i'm about to throw out here i'm going to be honest with you
[01:29.600 --> 01:36.720]  i am reassessing everything we do on this radio slash tv transmission we've always
[01:36.720 --> 01:42.320]  covered eugenics we've discussed how it guides the globalist and how the entire architecture of
[01:42.320 --> 01:48.240]  the planetary tyranny of their building is designed to attack humanity
[01:52.160 --> 01:58.640]  but psychologically and intellectually i know i'm a hundred percent right because our enemies
[01:58.640 --> 02:03.360]  are so arrogant they're just admitting everything they're doing and they are murdering us they are
[02:03.360 --> 02:11.200]  killing us they are brain damaging us they are people who take on a camouflage of liberal
[02:11.200 --> 02:19.840]  altruistic love when they are a pack of vicious murdering criminals and i really think we need
[02:19.840 --> 02:25.280]  to turn the heat up on them and i don't know exactly how to do that i mean i try to expose them
[02:25.280 --> 02:31.600]  but that's not enough that's not enough when they're assaulting us and killing us i'm going to be
[02:31.600 --> 02:46.080]  honest with you every time my children come over to me and hug me and kiss me and tell me how much
[02:46.080 --> 02:53.280]  they care about me and how proud they are of me and then i think about how we have these criminals
[02:53.280 --> 02:58.400]  running our society and how they're doing everything they can to hurt my children and how they put
[02:58.400 --> 03:04.560]  poison out in the food and in the water and how it's it's almost impossible to keep my children
[03:04.560 --> 03:11.360]  away from what they're doing i have intense feelings of love not just for my children but
[03:11.360 --> 03:17.280]  everybody else and i see all over the news the children with all their hair falling out and dying
[03:17.280 --> 03:25.840]  and i know they're being killed by the globalist and i'm just saying i'm not going to put up with
[03:25.840 --> 03:30.720]  this and and you shouldn't put up with this if somebody came to your door and knocked on it you
[03:30.720 --> 03:36.400]  open the door and they beat you over the head or they stabbed you you would have a right to defend
[03:36.400 --> 03:41.360]  yourself or they pulled a gun out to kill you or they broke in your house and that's federal and
[03:41.360 --> 03:47.760]  state law you have a right to defend yourself but when Gardasil came out three years ago
[03:48.560 --> 03:53.600]  they knew in the trials that it killed large percentages of the girls that took it and they
[03:53.600 --> 03:58.720]  did it as a test they came out and they had governor Perry claim it was mandatory that was
[03:58.720 --> 04:03.600]  a hoax he just put it on the list of vaccines recommended by the state of the health department
[04:03.600 --> 04:09.040]  they then lie and the media then lies and tells you it's the law to take it to go to school for 11
[04:10.080 --> 04:15.280]  12 and 13 year olds and then it came out and they said yeah it's killed people and it's causing
[04:15.280 --> 04:20.720]  autoimmune diseases and others and they just say that we don't care we're now going to inject boys
[04:20.720 --> 04:24.640]  too and it's going to brain damage you and it's going to cause autoimmune diseases and it's going
[04:24.640 --> 04:29.520]  to make you bleed out of every orifice and it's going to kill some of you because it's liberal
[04:29.520 --> 04:34.880]  and loving I mean it's just it's just mind control how they just come right out and say we're going
[04:34.880 --> 04:39.120]  to put lithium in your water they admit sodium fluoride is giving people cancer they they know
[04:39.120 --> 04:46.880]  it does it and they just laugh at you they're assaulting us they're they're attacking us the
[04:46.880 --> 04:52.240]  city of Austin puts fluoride in the water where I live and they know it increases cancer they
[04:52.240 --> 04:57.680]  hate your guts they're a pack of psychopathic murdering criminals I'm gonna come back and
[04:57.680 --> 05:04.320]  talk about this but I'm done the question is where should the American people draw their line in the
[05:04.320 --> 05:11.040]  sand what have we got a republic or a monarchy a republic is based on a constitution which protects
[05:11.040 --> 05:16.080]  minority rights not democracy not mob rule two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner
[05:16.080 --> 05:21.920]  so they think they own our land they think they're on our water children our education our money we
[05:21.920 --> 05:28.480]  have to define who we are and what we will tolerate somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the
[05:28.480 --> 05:34.080]  patriot uprising you have the facts we have the constitution we have the bill of rights we have

[08:38.800 --> 08:49.200]  i want to illustrate something and then we're going to open the phones up specifically
[08:49.760 --> 08:50.720]  on this question
[08:53.840 --> 08:56.640]  what do you believe we should do
[08:59.840 --> 09:07.760]  to break the silence to break the conditioning and to rally free humanity against the force
[09:07.760 --> 09:14.960]  drugging and poisoning of the entire food and water supply as well as vaccines being rolled out
[09:14.960 --> 09:23.200]  in mass that literally send in live viruses to eat the neuron receptor sites for anger and resistance
[09:23.200 --> 09:28.000]  and strength they admit they want lithium in the water they're already putting it in but they're
[09:28.000 --> 09:32.880]  now pushing it publicly to make you servile sodium fluoride we had a top brain surgeon on
[09:32.880 --> 09:40.720]  yesterday who read from top epa and fda scientist thousands of which have signed public letters
[09:40.720 --> 09:46.720]  in the last decade begging the government to take sodium fluoride out and citing hundreds of studies
[09:46.720 --> 09:52.320]  admitting it at least doubles cancer in the bones in the liver
[09:56.720 --> 10:01.280]  they come out and they admit they're going to approve garter cell three years ago they admit
[10:01.280 --> 10:08.160]  it kills people in the trials and then they tell these dumbed down fluoride head housewives who are
[10:08.160 --> 10:14.080]  so trusting and these soccer moms and these soccer dads take your daughters in give them the shots
[10:14.080 --> 10:21.200]  and then i literally saw scores scores of local newscast where they'd show the girl on a ventilator
[10:21.200 --> 10:27.920]  the cheerleader over and over again and then they'd show newscast of them dead in a hammer
[10:27.920 --> 10:36.160]  and we just calmly sit here and we take it they knew 60 years ago when they approved corn syrup
[10:36.160 --> 10:42.160]  that when they gave it to rats they more than quadrupled their chances of cancer here it is
[10:42.160 --> 10:51.600]  raw story today citing mainstream reports corn byproduct fructose literally fuels cancer cell
[10:51.600 --> 11:01.280]  growth study finds they knew when they approved more than five decades ago by spina all a that in
[11:01.280 --> 11:07.440]  every study of monkeys and rats and guinea pigs i'm getting chills right now i actually got chill
[11:07.440 --> 11:12.960]  bumps because as a normal human i understand this violent assault i know i'm being attacked
[11:12.960 --> 11:18.560]  just like if somebody breaks in my house at night i'm gonna get out of bed and just get a defense
[11:18.560 --> 11:24.080]  mode and anybody who's red-blooded would but more and more they're reporting people lay down and
[11:24.080 --> 11:30.320]  let themselves be attacked six kids slipped in one after the other like lemmings into a river
[11:30.320 --> 11:38.400]  not knowing what to do not knowing how to swim people just walk out in front of cars now they
[11:38.400 --> 11:42.720]  just pull out in front of cars and the studies show they're on serotonin reuptake inhibitors
[11:42.720 --> 11:49.520]  they've been turned into zombies you wonder why the public can't resist you wonder why the public
[11:49.520 --> 11:54.480]  can't get angry have you noticed the illegal aliens can protest by the tens of millions nationwide
[11:54.480 --> 12:00.480]  multiple times a year because they're coming from mexico they're still red-blooded their water's
[12:00.480 --> 12:07.520]  not fluoridated i'll tell you this i look at the illegal aliens they're a lot more alive than the
[12:07.520 --> 12:12.240]  average hispanic black white or asian that's been living in this country eating the poisons
[12:12.240 --> 12:16.160]  you go down to mexico they don't have all these additives in the food though that's starting to
[12:16.160 --> 12:22.480]  change you look at old black and white photos of your grandparents your great grandparents
[12:22.480 --> 12:27.920]  their eyes are electric they look awake they look alive you look at people now they look like
[12:27.920 --> 12:33.280]  like zombies i look at these illegal aliens i watch them out my window while they're building
[12:33.280 --> 12:38.160]  a house across the street those people their eyes are on fire you can see it
[12:38.160 --> 12:46.560]  it makes me rethink everything it it starts making me think about geopolitical movements
[12:46.560 --> 12:50.720]  perhaps all we've got's the third world left it looks like the west has already been ruined
[12:50.720 --> 12:56.720]  perhaps i should just join with those people and actually go and try to wake them up to what's
[12:56.720 --> 13:01.680]  happening and say fine i'll be for your lee larry conquista don't abort your kids don't take the
[13:01.680 --> 13:06.800]  shots maybe they'll listen because i've been studying in africa and asia and in the middle east
[13:06.800 --> 13:11.920]  when the un pulls up with armored vehicles they've made local payoffs to police to forcibly inject
[13:11.920 --> 13:17.600]  everybody the people run to the hills they fight to the death because they know that when their
[13:17.600 --> 13:21.360]  women are injected they always come for the pregnant women that's in the programs and they
[13:21.360 --> 13:27.360]  have miscarriages and then become sterile they run they fight they fight in peru and then it came
[13:27.360 --> 13:32.960]  out they were being sterilized down there but americans may be too far gone on average already
[13:32.960 --> 13:37.840]  chemically lobotomized already can't even get angry already can't even wake up
[13:42.320 --> 13:48.560]  i don't even know what to say anymore i've got all this other news here on immigration and the
[13:48.560 --> 13:57.520]  economy and i ran an attempted bombing of akmed denigid akmed denigad and election news and
[13:57.520 --> 14:03.920]  and government run health care information and congressman calling for the execution of wiki
[14:03.920 --> 14:10.320]  leaks whistleblower and uh calls to shut down wiki leaks and arrest julien assange
[14:11.920 --> 14:15.360]  more and more it looks like they're the real deal we've been analyzing it we've not been sure
[14:19.520 --> 14:26.080]  but none of it matters when you realize there is a scientific dictatorship
[14:26.080 --> 14:32.160]  in their own words in their own textbooks in all their own documents and they're cold bloodedly
[14:32.160 --> 14:37.840]  just doing it they know buys phenol a and all the major plastic products and food packaging
[14:37.840 --> 14:44.320]  is massively destroying uh your uh and and and disrupting your hormones and sterilizing you
[14:44.320 --> 14:51.600]  and giving you cancer it's all admitted they know these different corn products are filled with
[14:51.600 --> 14:59.600]  mercury and are toxic and are killing people they know that's their plan it's not an accident
[14:59.600 --> 15:04.240]  they're now out in the open saying they're doing it for our own good and then i've got the sunshine
[15:04.240 --> 15:11.120]  project documents that i'm going to do a whole report on later this week or next week that we
[15:11.120 --> 15:16.080]  covered 10 years ago but what's old is new that i went over two nights ago when i just remembered
[15:16.080 --> 15:20.560]  it and pulled it up we did some research and found it and found articles where the marine core
[15:20.560 --> 15:24.880]  demanded that the sunshine project take it down and they refused and then got attacked
[15:25.520 --> 15:31.600]  where they have got helicopter bases everywhere with waiting helicopters with nerve gas to kill
[15:31.600 --> 15:39.200]  people with with synthetic weaponized opiates to knock you out and ladies and gentlemen
[15:40.400 --> 15:46.880]  the pentagon is studying flying over and spraying you and then forget just lithium
[15:46.880 --> 15:51.040]  and fluoride and all the poisons they put in the water that dumb you down and give you cancer
[15:51.040 --> 15:58.800]  and sterilize you or reduce fertility bare minimum flying over and just spraying us and then you have
[15:58.800 --> 16:03.840]  a fever you have brain inflammation the viruses they spray and that's in all their studies they
[16:03.840 --> 16:08.240]  want to put it in the food where you can't get away from it where the food the tomatoes the
[16:08.240 --> 16:15.120]  potatoes the the the bananas that's seeing in grow the virus in it you eat it and then literally
[16:15.120 --> 16:20.880]  you can't get upset you can't resist i mean this is all in hundreds of news reports in the last
[16:20.880 --> 16:26.880]  two weeks they have come out and they're pushing it like oh i know you're chomping at the pit but
[16:26.880 --> 16:31.360]  you gotta wait it'll be a year or two but then it's going to be available and you're going to have
[16:31.360 --> 16:37.200]  all these new vaccines that aren't even vaccines that are dna reprogrammers and that's another lie
[16:37.200 --> 16:42.560]  you know they give it all oh it's a cognitive brain boost you're not going to be upset anymore
[16:42.560 --> 16:47.920]  we're designed to get upset about tyranny we're designed to be upset about government overtaxing
[16:47.920 --> 16:54.560]  us and trying to tell our listen i've sent my children for the last five years to the first
[16:54.560 --> 17:02.080]  methodist church vacation bible school every august can't send them pulled them out monday
[17:03.040 --> 17:08.400]  they sit there with a puppet telling them go tell your parents the earth is dying go tell them
[17:08.400 --> 17:12.720]  they've got to have light bulbs like this the mercury filled light bulbs that admittedly
[17:12.720 --> 17:16.560]  cause all sorts of neurological disorders and it's not that that church is even bad they're
[17:16.560 --> 17:22.160]  just brainwashed they're just promoting it everywhere it's just it's the private schools it's the
[17:22.160 --> 17:29.600]  churches it's everything you're supposed to get angry about that you're supposed to do something
[17:29.600 --> 17:36.000]  about it that's what the anger and the concern is for more and more i see articles every couple
[17:36.000 --> 17:40.480]  days where people will watch out of a high rise apartment even in a nice part of town as a woman
[17:40.480 --> 17:46.560]  is beaten and raped in an alleyway and no one even helps her and no one even calls 911 i mean i
[17:46.560 --> 17:51.360]  wouldn't call 911 or maybe as i was running down the stairs of the apartment building i would i'd
[17:51.360 --> 17:57.920]  go out there with a firearm and protect that woman and and people people would consider me a hero
[17:57.920 --> 18:05.200]  i'm not a hero i'm normal i'm what my species has always been i'm a human being like my ancestors
[18:05.200 --> 18:13.360]  i'm strong i'm red-blooded i've got courage it's like when i saved that lady who was choking to
[18:13.360 --> 18:20.880]  death i was in the bathroom at the lamada line seven eight years ago and i went to the bathroom
[18:20.880 --> 18:26.480]  my wife and my son are out there he was a baby at the time and i come out everybody's gathered
[18:26.480 --> 18:30.240]  around this woman who's turning blue and i i say do the heimlich and they started trying to resist
[18:30.240 --> 18:35.120]  me and they were just like parrots saying call 911 call 911 and i said she'll be dead by the
[18:35.120 --> 18:39.200]  time they get here and i had to shove them out of the way to save the lady and then they were like
[18:39.200 --> 18:46.240]  oh you're such a hero oh you're such a hero trying to just scum they're just scum but they're not
[18:46.240 --> 18:54.160]  scum they have been turned into scum by the drugs in the water and the food a bunch of passive
[18:54.160 --> 19:00.720]  lemmings brainwashed by tv brainwashed by culture drugged all these different systems of control
[19:00.720 --> 19:09.680]  overlaid and so we are being assaulted and we have to recognize it i mean it's on record they

[27:31.680 --> 27:37.920]  at one federal courthouse just from florida they have saved tens of thousands of images
[27:37.920 --> 27:44.640]  of course it's for their naked body scanning and we reported on this 11 years ago that major
[27:44.640 --> 27:50.640]  clothiers were putting in tailor machines that scan your body that data is then sold to the feds
[27:50.640 --> 27:55.360]  this is a biometric scan it gives you cancer and they're storing your naked body and it violates
[27:55.360 --> 28:00.560]  child porn laws i want you to do an article saying naked body scanners you know aren't just
[28:01.360 --> 28:06.720]  aren't just storing it the rest of the story and tell people see we told you so in all those
[28:06.720 --> 28:12.320]  what 10 15 or more articles that you and steven curt have written when we documented that their
[28:12.320 --> 28:18.240]  own documents say they're storing it which shows they're a pack of criminal liars of course they
[28:18.240 --> 28:25.200]  lied to you all they do is lie to the public and tell you that everything's okay watson this is
[28:25.200 --> 28:30.640]  incredible though that these creatures now admit it gives you cancer and that they are storing it

[28:37.680 --> 28:43.280]  they've lied about these body scanner devices at every turn i mean they were introduced on the
[28:43.280 --> 28:51.120]  basis that they don't show clear images of genitalia and yet right from the very beginning
[28:51.120 --> 28:57.200]  on the tsa's website you could go on there and see the kind of images that these produce and
[28:57.200 --> 29:04.800]  they produce a clear outline of genitalia indeed that's what the researchers for example from the
[29:04.800 --> 29:11.280]  london guardian who went in and looked at the trial said that it produces quote eerily visible
[29:11.280 --> 29:16.400]  images of genitalia and to make sure they've got the scanner tuned right they look at the genital
[29:16.400 --> 29:22.640]  the female folds in the male uh shape to make sure it's tuned just like a photographer looks at the
[29:22.640 --> 29:28.080]  eye or looks at moles on the face when you're taking a photo when you're tuning a camera to focus
[29:28.080 --> 29:35.280]  it a video camera or a still photo in the handbook they are told to look at the genitals training them

[35:06.080 --> 35:12.480]  caught abusing their power and many of them have been caught using these naked body scanners to harass
[35:12.480 --> 35:18.960]  their own colleagues so you've got the worst possible breed of individuals running these machines
[35:18.960 --> 35:25.680]  they completely violate privacy um and they produce radiation at 20 times the dose we were
[35:25.680 --> 35:32.560]  originally told columbia's university report back in june that they were placed in millions of people
[35:32.560 --> 35:39.040]  at risk well i want to be clear they give you cancer that's mainline scientists and universities
[35:39.040 --> 35:42.880]  they lied from the beginning about what the machines are even for they're designed to get a
[35:42.880 --> 35:49.360]  naked 360 biometric scan of your body and the from the from the inception the electronic privacy
[35:49.360 --> 35:53.520]  information center got the documents that these devices are designed to be deployed in a way
[35:53.520 --> 35:57.520]  that allows the images to be routinely stored and recorded which is exactly what the marshal service
[35:57.520 --> 36:06.720]  is doing uh 35 314 images stored just on one machine in orlando florida from the airport
[36:06.720 --> 36:13.920]  everybody run through that at that one airport 35 000 plus stored it's totally illegal the criminal
[36:13.920 --> 36:19.920]  degenerate murderous homeland security lied to everybody and said they weren't from the beginning
[36:19.920 --> 36:24.800]  they were doing it just like they lie about why the fluorides in the water when their own documents
[36:24.800 --> 36:29.120]  say it's meant to sterilize you and give you cancer just like they lie about bison allay and
[36:29.120 --> 36:34.640]  now admit it's sterilizing us and giving us cancer i mean watch and we've got to wake up even myself
[36:34.640 --> 36:41.280]  and you and everyone just how murderous and lying and criminal they are they are complete scumbag
[36:41.280 --> 36:46.880]  criminals and they have a bunch of dumbed down fluoride head tsa cops and others they'll do
[36:46.880 --> 36:52.720]  whatever they're told and it's total evil they're bathing our children in radiation in the naked
[36:52.720 --> 36:56.800]  body scanners they're saying they're going to have a mobile on the streets of america to travel
[36:56.800 --> 37:02.240]  they've got dumbed down brain damaged cops pulled from the general public running it they all think
[37:02.240 --> 37:10.400]  it's funny they're a pack of total scum but the good news is i mean there's a revolt against
[37:10.400 --> 37:16.960]  these bodies scanners due by air force that they're not getting them and in ida ho you had that bill
[37:16.960 --> 37:22.400]  whereby they would throw them out and not allow them in ida ho so if people lobby their government
[37:22.400 --> 37:27.280]  to the state level then we can get these thrown out and then if there's a boycott of the air force
[37:27.280 --> 37:33.760]  that do continue to use them fewer economic forces will drive them out of existence absolutely if

[38:53.920 --> 39:00.560]  scientific dictatorship where they announce the vaccines the naked body scanners the gmo crops
[39:00.560 --> 39:06.480]  everything with a with a front cover story but it's never that and we've analyzed their attack
[39:06.480 --> 39:12.240]  profile i always know exactly what they're doing and then i can run and then i can search what my
[39:12.240 --> 39:17.840]  mind already comes up with and read the exact words they've written because i know the enemy that well
[39:17.840 --> 39:23.200]  i knew it was a biometric 360 shoot because i'd seen it 10 years ago boom they admit it is i knew
[39:23.200 --> 39:27.840]  it was being stored by the federal marshals who were over the air marshals boom it's now admitted
[39:27.840 --> 39:34.000]  i knew it was massive cancer increases boom now admitted i mean they get to fry you they get to
[39:34.000 --> 39:40.560]  train you to be a slave they get your biometric scan and then they criminally viciously hatefully
[39:40.560 --> 39:46.560]  lie the entire time telling the public in the last year that they weren't saving it and that it
[39:46.560 --> 39:52.720]  didn't give you cancer they are murdering scum people have to get this they're murdering you
[39:52.720 --> 39:57.680]  with soft kill with the radiation you don't die there on the spot you die 10 years later

[40:04.000 --> 40:10.480]  eugenicists they are murdering murdering criminal government and now all these sheriffs and all
[40:10.480 --> 40:14.800]  these prominent people are coming out and saying we have a criminal government it's waging war
[40:14.800 --> 40:21.200]  against america we have a criminal yes we have a criminal criminal criminal murderous murder
[40:21.200 --> 40:27.200]  government i mean just to the murdering trash they're murdering all of us and i'm sick of it
[40:27.200 --> 40:30.720]  and i'm sick of all the dumbed-down cowards they go along with it watson
[40:30.720 --> 40:38.480]  well it's all out there in the open i mean we've passed that stage but now the problem is as you
[40:38.480 --> 40:45.600]  said people are ingesting and paving themselves in this neurotoxin sodium fluoride that removes
[40:45.600 --> 40:50.960]  their aggression that makes them docile and compliant that's why the communists use it in
[40:50.960 --> 40:56.960]  the gulags that's why the Nazis used it in the concentration camps and uh really the battle
[40:56.960 --> 41:04.320]  now is about just making people look up from the stupor of their own controlled brainwashing which
[41:04.320 --> 41:09.520]  is why as you've been doing recently focusing on what people are actually putting in their bodies
[41:09.520 --> 41:15.760]  and the effect that that has and it's by design you know countless comments and emails i get say
[41:15.760 --> 41:20.160]  well i know it's admitted that bisphenol a sterilizes and give us cancer i know it's admitted
[41:20.160 --> 41:24.880]  that fluoride's doing it i you know i know it's admitted that they're coming out with vaccines
[41:24.880 --> 41:30.000]  that brain damage you by design but you know what they're just doing it because they're greedy
[41:30.000 --> 41:34.240]  no they're doing it because they are greedy they want to get rid of everybody and
[41:36.000 --> 41:40.720]  watson i really appreciate you joining us let's get some reports out on this let's get steve on
[41:40.720 --> 41:45.680]  this as well and let's just point out that we a year ago and repeatedly since then have written
[41:45.680 --> 41:51.360]  articles with with the documents that are now being reported on by cbs news and cnat that we told
[41:51.360 --> 41:56.480]  everybody and that it's even worse than what they're being told you can just search we found it again
[41:56.480 --> 42:01.520]  last week guys what was the search i told you to find where the clothing companies are using biometric
[42:01.520 --> 42:06.480]  scans for tailoring and then that's really being used as a biometric so that's how they trick you
[42:06.480 --> 42:10.320]  oh step right in here we're going to give you a good fit meanwhile that company's real business
[42:10.320 --> 42:15.440]  isn't just selling clothes it's getting your biometric fingerprint of your body and it's the
[42:15.440 --> 42:20.800]  same thing with this it's the same thing with the airports it's meant to train you to be humiliated
[42:20.800 --> 42:24.720]  as you'll put up with your children being naked body scan you'll put up with anything it's meant
[42:24.720 --> 42:29.840]  to give you cancer and it's meant to be stored in these databases and the government lied about it
[42:29.840 --> 42:35.920]  i mean when do they not lie watson well you can tell when the line because i like to move it
[42:37.200 --> 42:41.040]  and they state they want to get rid of us it's on record watson thank you for joining us thank
[42:41.040 --> 42:51.680]  colleague i mean i'm here watching them slow kill us i'm here watching their stealth death
[42:51.680 --> 42:57.280]  i'm here watching them and i made that video that became the number one search term yesterday
[42:57.280 --> 43:04.880]  thanks to you again the number one search term in the country brain eating vaccines brain eating
[43:04.880 --> 43:09.200]  vaccines that's something a layman could understand and that's what it does but the media is like oh it
[43:09.200 --> 43:16.400]  reprograms it changes your dna which is a technical term it goes in and attacks the neuro receptors
[43:17.920 --> 43:22.240]  so that when you when your brain gets threatened by something it gives an order
[43:22.240 --> 43:26.880]  for hormones to be released by the hypothalamus and the thyroid and other things
[43:30.000 --> 43:35.520]  so that you can then get geared up to defend yourself but they're saying that's abnormal
[43:35.520 --> 43:40.160]  all of you are sick this is all over the news you need a shot to make you happy
[43:40.160 --> 43:44.640]  you're not going to be angry or nervous anymore when you pull up to that police checkpoint with
[43:44.640 --> 43:49.120]  their naked body scanning in taking your families away from you when your preachers up there telling
[43:49.120 --> 43:54.240]  you go to the fema camp as they've been trained to do clergy response team don't worry you're
[43:54.240 --> 43:57.840]  going to have this shot and you're not going to be worried about anything anymore you're not going
[43:57.840 --> 44:02.400]  to be worried about becoming homeless you're not going to worry about being euthanized down the road
[44:02.400 --> 44:08.320]  you're not going to be worried about anything because the loving vaccine has cured you of
[44:08.320 --> 44:14.160]  your humanity it's literally killed who you were it's turned you into a biological robot do you
[44:14.160 --> 44:20.960]  realize it's 2010 let me ask you this question then we're going to your calls 800 years ago in
[44:20.960 --> 44:26.000]  medieval england they were incredibly oppressive dominated the public kept the public on about
[44:26.000 --> 44:30.960]  five percent of the land through feudalism to keep them near starvation as a tool of control
[44:30.960 --> 44:38.240]  they wrote manuscripts on it all over europe same thing with the uh showgun and the japanese samurai
[44:38.240 --> 44:44.560]  same deal they told you what time to go to bed what to wear what to do uh samurai would routinely
[44:44.560 --> 44:48.480]  call somebody up from the rice paddy and chop them up just to demonstrate their power they were
[44:48.480 --> 44:53.520]  allowed to kill whoever they wanted now if they would could have had an injection that made the
[44:53.520 --> 45:02.080]  public servile individuals who couldn't fight back would they have injected in japan 500 years
[45:02.080 --> 45:08.880]  ago or england 800 years ago would they have injected the serfs 100 they would well here's
[45:08.880 --> 45:14.240]  the deal despite the florida and the lithium and the bisphenol a and all the things they're adding
[45:14.240 --> 45:20.080]  to your food and water and despite the fact that the us iq has dropped between 10 and 15 points
[45:20.080 --> 45:25.360]  in the last 20 years you can just search the term iq in the united states dropping not the
[45:25.360 --> 45:31.440]  education level not the test scores those are dropping too physically people are dumb they're
[45:31.440 --> 45:38.000]  dumber i mean most people can't even hardly talk anymore or they can't get upset or they can't get
[45:38.000 --> 45:45.200]  motivated the strongest most focused most hardcore people the world had ever seen the people of the
[45:45.200 --> 45:52.400]  united states now the fattest the dumbest the weakest the most servile because you have been
[45:52.400 --> 45:57.200]  chemically attacked and most of the politicians don't know about this they just drink it and
[45:57.200 --> 46:02.320]  go along with it they're the same but when you read about the rockefellers the rothschilds the
[46:02.320 --> 46:07.360]  british royalty the dutch royalty in every documentary about them they have giant plantations
[46:08.000 --> 46:14.000]  in walled cities i saw a pbs documentary about prince philip where they have their own beef all
[46:14.000 --> 46:19.600]  of their own crops and when they travel it's prepared and shipped with chefs and they are
[46:19.600 --> 46:26.240]  incredibly careful about what they eat and what they do and you know they're living to be 100
[46:26.240 --> 46:32.720]  years old on average routinely up to 100 these royal families 95 you know for the men 100 plus
[46:32.720 --> 46:37.840]  for the women and they're walking around in public think of them when they go to a shopping mall
[46:37.840 --> 46:41.280]  every once in a while or when they're in public they get to look at how they're mutating people
[46:41.280 --> 46:47.600]  they get to look at the at the at the power and and and the poisoning they get that enjoyment over
[46:47.600 --> 46:54.160]  you that they have engineered a system to slowly murder you and your family and they enjoy it so
[46:54.160 --> 47:00.880]  much and now they've already got you so chemically poisoned that they're coming out and saying okay
[47:01.760 --> 47:06.400]  we know you're gonna want this that's how all these articles push it oh it's so great they're
[47:06.400 --> 47:11.200]  about to start trials with the troops with something that reprograms their brain that'll make them
[47:11.200 --> 47:17.680]  feel better yeah hundreds of vaccines at a time live viruses oh Gardasil is going to be so great
[47:17.680 --> 47:26.240]  for your girls a couple thousand people die you're a cervical cancer so we're going to fix that oh by
[47:26.240 --> 47:30.480]  what by the way the vaccine insert admits it doesn't even protect you from it but it will
[47:30.480 --> 47:36.400]  cause an autoimmune response and it's a good chance it's going to kill you and the moms are like oh
[47:36.400 --> 47:40.960]  good and then their mom's always on the news going my baby's dead shows her on the respirator
[47:40.960 --> 47:46.480]  then shows her at the funeral there's they killed her they was the doctor says it was the vaccine
[47:48.160 --> 47:51.840]  and the government's just like that's right and because you're on sodium fluoride and
[47:51.840 --> 47:58.560]  bisphenol a lady you can't even resist us if somebody comes to your door to kill you
[47:59.280 --> 48:06.640]  with a hatchet you have a right to defend yourself well what do we do about scum control freaks
[48:06.640 --> 48:11.200]  who've drugged us up to the point now that they think we're so drugged out of our minds
[48:11.920 --> 48:17.280]  key chemicals to make us not be able to become angry and to be assertive and to commit to something
[48:18.720 --> 48:23.840]  you know my parents never gave me vaccines i've never had any vaccines except when i almost
[48:23.840 --> 48:30.880]  chopped my arm off one time that big old scar right there and they gave me shots at the hospital
[48:30.880 --> 48:36.880]  i've had tetanus shots when i was a child i noticed i got a headache every time i brush with
[48:36.880 --> 48:41.520]  sodium fluoride toothpaste and would have to lay down on the couch so i quit brushing with that and
[48:41.520 --> 48:46.400]  started just brushing with soap didn't even say anything to my dentist father i just didn't
[48:46.400 --> 48:51.920]  like feeling good in the morning brushing and then feeling ill so i quit i could never drink
[48:51.920 --> 48:57.840]  the dallas water it it tasted like kerosene and then and i still drank a lot of florida
[48:57.840 --> 49:02.800]  to water but it but and so a lot of who i would have been has been destroyed but i've still got
[49:02.800 --> 49:08.640]  enough humanity and enough primitive focus to integrate with my intellectual compass and resist
[49:08.640 --> 49:14.560]  these people they're murdering you and your families i love the police officers i'm not at
[49:14.560 --> 49:20.400]  some macho primitive level wanting to have war with you i realize your brain damaged brainwashed

[49:26.800 --> 49:30.400]  mayor you know here in austin who won't take the fluoride out even though they're there every week
[49:30.400 --> 49:34.800]  demanding it be taken out and their own scientists say it's deadly they just you know it's just a
[49:34.800 --> 49:42.720]  big joke to them but we've got to go to these mind numbed criminals and tell them look i don't care
[49:42.720 --> 49:46.800]  if you say it's good for me you little piece of trash you don't have a right to medicate me

[56:00.160 --> 56:06.080]  that segment no i didn't well it was actually for the first few minutes of it a fair piece
[56:06.880 --> 56:13.520]  amazingly but uh they wrapped it up obviously by having their experts on and calling her an idiot
[56:13.520 --> 56:19.040]  and claiming she faked it well it's it's and they always use a case example to claim it's all fake
[56:19.040 --> 56:26.560]  the drug insert the vaccine insert for h1n1 says that it causes geon beret and the british government
[56:26.560 --> 56:34.400]  just admitted that it gave a tenfold increase uh in convulsions with the h1n1 shot so yes they're
[56:34.400 --> 56:41.840]  running disinfo pieces literally taking part in the murder and brain damage of the public these are

[57:14.320 --> 57:22.320]  take it well anybody who would give their kid this shot or any of these shots it isn't is crazy
[57:22.320 --> 57:27.680]  and uh i don't know if you're familiar with the dugger family there's a lot of families that have
[57:27.680 --> 57:32.800]  been damaged no tell me about them well they haven't been damaged they don't vaccinate their kids in

[57:50.320 --> 57:57.440]  them they admit the h1n1 caused massive giambore uh i talked to a local talk show host who didn't

[01:01:18.160 --> 01:01:22.400]  not going to be okay as long as you don't fight for for what's happening to you what do you think
[01:01:22.400 --> 01:01:26.880]  of the fact that they admit they've been storing the naked-body images the whole time it does give
[01:01:26.880 --> 01:01:31.600]  you cancer and they lied to us and they now admit they're putting lithium in the water
[01:01:31.600 --> 01:01:36.720]  they're poisoning us fluoride is there to poison us i mean that they're out in the open now saying
[01:01:36.720 --> 01:01:42.080]  they're helping us well i'm not surprised that they're saying they're helping us because look
[01:01:42.080 --> 01:01:46.560]  the first time we ever if you think back at the first time i ever saw body scanner wasn't a movie
[01:01:46.560 --> 01:01:50.640]  total recall they were just preparing us to understand that brain that this was gonna have
[01:01:50.640 --> 01:01:55.680]  because and now here we go we have we have body scanners all over the place and the fact that
[01:01:55.680 --> 01:01:59.280]  they said that they're going we're gonna delete we're gonna delete these pictures they're not
[01:01:59.280 --> 01:02:04.080]  meant to stay there it's all bunch of baloney because every time they say it's right it's always
[01:02:04.080 --> 01:02:08.560]  gonna happen left every time they say this is good for you eventually bad for you same with
[01:02:08.560 --> 01:02:13.120]  the swine flu and they hacked up the pandemic and nothing ever occurred nothing ever occurred
[01:02:13.120 --> 01:02:17.680]  except for the people who actually went out and took the swine flu shot yeah i mean they tested
[01:02:17.680 --> 01:02:22.160]  Gardasil they knew it was killing people they knew on the insert it doesn't protect you from
[01:02:22.160 --> 01:02:27.520]  cervical cancer and they put it out to see if they could just kill people and get away with it
[01:02:27.520 --> 01:02:32.080]  and they did they're like we're gonna murder you we're gonna brain damage you we're gonna give you
[01:02:32.080 --> 01:02:35.760]  an autoimmune disorder and there's nothing you're gonna do about it and we're gonna order you to
[01:02:35.760 --> 01:02:40.560]  take it and they just do it with a straight face they are assaulting us through the drugs the food
[01:02:40.560 --> 01:02:47.040]  the water god bless you miguel let's talk to craig and dc craig you're on the air oh alex my dear
[01:02:47.040 --> 01:02:53.680]  friend how are you doing i just it's really hitting home just how hardcore a situation we're in i mean
[01:02:53.680 --> 01:02:58.720]  i'm living in a science fiction nightmare and i realize now that most of the public is brain
[01:02:58.720 --> 01:03:03.680]  damaged and they really did brain damage them and now they're going to increase the brain damage
[01:03:03.680 --> 01:03:08.000]  system and they're going to put it in the food and the water even more and spray it in the air
[01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:12.240]  so that i can't escape it and they're going to try to brain damage my children they're murdering
[01:03:12.240 --> 01:03:19.680]  criminals coming to kill me well earlier in the show you asked for solutions and and what miguel
[01:03:19.680 --> 01:03:26.000]  was saying uh just a minute ago was right on point i think what needs to happen is that all of us
[01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:30.400]  who are aware of the new world order and what our what our government is doing we need to
[01:03:30.400 --> 01:03:37.280]  as you say get out of our comfort comfort zone we need to become leaders ourselves and recruit
[01:03:37.280 --> 01:03:44.400]  we need to we need in essence to grow ourselves like a military the problem in this country is
[01:03:44.400 --> 01:03:51.840]  one of the problems is that um our leadership our politicians do not fear the people whatsoever
[01:03:51.840 --> 01:03:57.600]  so they're running rough shot over us well they actually are starting to fear us that's why they're
[01:03:57.600 --> 01:04:02.080]  admitting they're drugging our water supply i want to force injections on us that literally brain
[01:04:02.080 --> 01:04:07.360]  damage us and and kill the area of the brain that allows you to get angry and focused and committed
[01:04:08.960 --> 01:04:16.720]  what needs to happen is those of us who are aware like you said we need we need to get the word out
[01:04:16.720 --> 01:04:24.240]  we need to go to church we need to tell everyone and try to convince as many people as we can
[01:04:24.240 --> 01:04:30.160]  and we need to get aggressive and and videos like my food the ultimate secret and media pushes

[01:12:57.600 --> 01:13:02.640]  then you go to city council and they will back off because when they come after you and most people
[01:13:02.640 --> 01:13:07.440]  they don't you hope they do when they come after you then everybody's going to start asking questions

[01:24:11.920 --> 01:24:12.880]  ladies and gentlemen
[01:24:12.880 --> 01:24:26.160]  Jonah Lerer I'm pretty can pronounce it L-E-H-R-E-R is a contributing editor at Wired and an
[01:24:26.160 --> 01:24:35.280]  author of How We Decide a Proust was a neuroscientist he graduated from Columbia University and
[01:24:35.280 --> 01:24:40.480]  studied at Oxford University as a Rhodes Scholar he's written for the New Yorker Nature Seed and
[01:24:40.480 --> 01:24:44.560]  the Washington Post the Boston Globe I'm also a contributing editor at Scientific American
[01:24:44.560 --> 01:24:50.240]  Mind and National Public Radio's Radio Lab he wrote a story and at the end of the article
[01:24:50.240 --> 01:25:01.600]  he says Alex Jones is a liar that's how the article ends Alex Jones is a liar and he focuses in
[01:25:01.600 --> 01:25:06.000]  on one of the articles we linked to in our story where the mail newspaper reported the
[01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:11.280]  quotes by the scientists saying this will make you calm this vaccine will make you happy it is a
[01:25:12.640 --> 01:25:21.760]  herpes virus that goes in and attacks the receptors so that the body can't become upset or agitated
[01:25:23.280 --> 01:25:27.360]  now this is on record this is what they said he goes on to say oh well actually
[01:25:27.920 --> 01:25:35.120]  they would traumatize rats with strokes and then inject them with this and it would cause
[01:25:35.120 --> 01:25:40.160]  the trauma hormones not to flood and cause more brain damage see the just like the naked
[01:25:40.160 --> 01:25:44.240]  body scanners that are protecting from terrorists really they're a 360 body scan they always give
[01:25:44.240 --> 01:25:49.600]  you a cover story and so they have this Rhodes Scholar Jonah Learer how do you pronounce that
[01:25:49.600 --> 01:25:58.720]  lehr yeah Jonah Learer this Rhodes Scholar this Cecil Rhodes openly wrote books about how he would
[01:25:58.720 --> 01:26:04.160]  get all the best and brightest to set up a plan for world government and a scientific dictatorship
[01:26:04.160 --> 01:26:10.800]  and here this guy is saying I'm a liar in our article about brain eating vaccines we link to
[01:26:10.800 --> 01:26:16.720]  mainstream news about a whole class of vaccines that are live viruses that go in and quote cure you
[01:26:16.720 --> 01:26:22.800]  of drug addiction by attacking the receptor sites in the same article and video I showed the New
[01:26:22.800 --> 01:26:28.880]  York Times Huffington Post the British Journal of Psychiatry and others saying they want to put
[01:26:28.880 --> 01:26:35.200]  lithium in the water as part of democracy to make us not commit suicide or be agitated it's an
[01:26:35.200 --> 01:26:41.680]  anti-psychotic so again he builds a straw man saying I'm a liar and that this is just about
[01:26:42.880 --> 01:26:47.120]  helping people with strokes where they claim that's one of the things this could be used for
[01:26:47.120 --> 01:26:53.040]  my point was the article quoting the scientist who may be a good guy maybe a bad guy that's only one
[01:26:53.040 --> 01:26:59.600]  thing I covered and they were saying it was to keep you from becoming angry or agitated and they
[01:26:59.600 --> 01:27:05.440]  said it was a cognitive booster and reprogram the brain with a live virus that goes into the brain
[01:27:05.440 --> 01:27:12.320]  that's my point is that these things do go into the brain and alter it just like in the Gardasil
[01:27:12.320 --> 01:27:17.680]  trials it killed a bunch of people and maimed them and caused autoimmune diseases just like they
[01:27:17.680 --> 01:27:23.280]  admit in the London Telegraph a tenfold increase at under five-year-olds who took the H1N1 shot
[01:27:23.280 --> 01:27:27.760]  two days ago they the government said quit giving the shot and the British medical journals come
[01:27:27.760 --> 01:27:32.080]  out and said it was all a big hoax and the vaccine's dangerous so did Wolfgang Wudarg the head of the
[01:27:32.080 --> 01:27:38.880]  European Union Scientific Commission who we had on earlier this year I mean we know what we're
[01:27:38.880 --> 01:27:44.000]  talking about and you could sit up there and say oh you know you know you write books about neuroscience
[01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:48.240]  and you know that's what you went to school for and you write for the New Yorker and nature and
[01:27:48.240 --> 01:27:55.280]  seed they are scared of this ladies and gentlemen they are scared so I'm asking Watson I'm asking
[01:27:55.280 --> 01:28:01.280]  Steve Watson both of them do detailed reports with literally 50 links maybe it could be 500 it
[01:28:01.280 --> 01:28:05.760]  could be a thousand it's unlimited with medical reports where they're calling for drugging the
[01:28:05.760 --> 01:28:10.320]  water where they admit fluorides causing cancer and brain damage and making you servile and where
[01:28:10.320 --> 01:28:15.520]  governments I mean there was the Wired Magazine article about oh they're gonna inject with lasers
[01:28:15.520 --> 01:28:20.640]  that print that again for me guys it's just Wired Magazine a laser injected DNA vaccine
[01:28:22.560 --> 01:28:28.560]  where they can inject hundreds of vaccines into your DNA I mean who knows what that's going to do
[01:28:28.560 --> 01:28:33.520]  and they already admit for decades they've been testing drugs and things and amnesics on the troops
[01:28:33.520 --> 01:28:37.360]  to make them more aggressive less aggressive to make them forget what they've done I mean this
[01:28:37.360 --> 01:28:43.600]  is all going on they're admittedly pushing all of this they're poisoning us I mean here it is
[01:28:43.600 --> 01:28:48.560]  raw story today reporting on a mainline study corn byproduct fructose literally fuels cancer
[01:28:48.560 --> 01:28:54.640]  cell growths study finds but they run TV ads telling you how great fructose is and telling
[01:28:54.640 --> 01:29:01.920]  you great how great corn syrup is and how we're conspiracy theorist but I should be happy about
[01:29:01.920 --> 01:29:07.520]  this the article is called the brain eating vaccine conspiracy I should be happy about this
[01:29:08.720 --> 01:29:16.320]  because people are now going to go and they are now going to see the true documentation
[01:29:16.320 --> 01:29:21.600]  information more your calls are coming up but I've got Paul Watson popping in via video Skype we're
[01:29:21.600 --> 01:29:25.280]  going to talk to him about this on air and he's going to get this out in the next three hours
[01:29:25.280 --> 01:29:33.840]  a detailed report that deals with all of this and shows you how they're spinning it as all this
[01:29:33.840 --> 01:29:40.240]  virus goes in and boost your brain no the virus goes in and literally depending on which vaccine
[01:29:40.240 --> 01:29:47.440]  it is creates plaques or attacks the receptor sites I've read the patents on these okay that's the
[01:29:47.440 --> 01:29:56.880]  facts we'll be right back we're on the march the empire's on the run alex jones and the gcn radio

[01:32:11.040 --> 01:32:16.080]  minority rights not democracy not mob rule two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner
[01:32:16.080 --> 01:32:21.920]  so they think they own our land they think they're on our water children our education our money we

[01:33:09.120 --> 01:33:14.720]  i'll tell you the good news about this individual jonah learer
[01:33:18.720 --> 01:33:22.640]  it goes on to say that he researches psychology and brain sciences
[01:33:22.640 --> 01:33:29.760]  neuro science and relationship between science humanities he is a road scholar which is set
[01:33:29.760 --> 01:33:34.960]  up to establish world government i mean i guess he tried to deny that the good news is his column
[01:33:35.840 --> 01:33:39.600]  section is called the frontal cortex the main thing the globalist are targeting with all these
[01:33:39.600 --> 01:33:45.200]  chemicals and drugs wired magazine he's come out and attacked me and i'm reading the comments
[01:33:45.840 --> 01:33:52.240]  every comment i've read points out hey alex jones shows all the articles whether new york
[01:33:52.240 --> 01:33:56.080]  times they want to put lithium in the water alex jones shows other articles where they
[01:33:56.080 --> 01:34:00.880]  admit that they do have vaccines that go in and attack the brain i was just that this was one
[01:34:00.880 --> 01:34:06.320]  thing we mentioned and in the quotes by the scientist he says it'll make you calm and happy
[01:34:06.320 --> 01:34:10.640]  you won't get angry anymore which is what the lithium they said they want to put in the water
[01:34:10.640 --> 01:34:22.880]  is for so you'll submit to all this so the great news is it's incredible
[01:34:25.200 --> 01:34:27.040]  that almost every comment here
[01:34:30.400 --> 01:34:31.520]  people are pointing out
[01:34:31.520 --> 01:34:42.560]  i mean everybody's attacking him he says by the way your cowardice and not presenting alex's video
[01:34:42.560 --> 01:34:49.200]  and trusting your readers to think for themselves is an indication of your overall character as a
[01:34:49.200 --> 01:34:56.160]  human being also the ad hominem against alex with which you end your polemic article rather than
[01:34:56.160 --> 01:35:03.920]  increased your credibility doesn't increase your credibility and just every one of them
[01:35:06.560 --> 01:35:10.400]  every one of these almost every one of these commenters comes out in the taxing
[01:35:13.200 --> 01:35:17.280]  so the good news is everybody's going to look into brain eating vaccines because they call
[01:35:17.280 --> 01:35:23.520]  they say a cognitive enhancement oh it changes your brain it changes your brain's dna yeah viruses
[01:35:23.520 --> 01:35:29.120]  are going in and attacking receptors especially just search the term i had all the articles here
[01:35:29.120 --> 01:35:33.120]  they're in my stack from yesterday i'll pull some of them out and go back over them again but
[01:35:33.120 --> 01:35:38.960]  they're in my videos as well that we've posted at info wars dot com where it's and i'm sorry i'm
[01:35:38.960 --> 01:35:42.960]  reading this here on air i just got the article and and just finished reading it over the break
[01:35:42.960 --> 01:35:56.240]  and now here on air it's just so mind-blowing incredibly mind-blowing to read all of the
[01:35:56.240 --> 01:36:01.200]  government patents and university patents and scientific patents where they say we're going
[01:36:01.200 --> 01:36:07.600]  to cure cure you of drug use and then you read the patents the viruses go in and attack the
[01:36:07.600 --> 01:36:15.360]  receptors that would take up the opiates or the nicotine or the cocaine well those receptors are
[01:36:15.360 --> 01:36:20.000]  there for a reason sure you can take a drug to manipulate them but the receptors are there
[01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:27.520]  to uptake endorphins you're supposed to be angry and passionate and full of life they're trying
[01:36:27.520 --> 01:36:32.000]  to make you a bunch of servile jellyfish and it's all over the news they want to do that
[01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:35.520]  so they can't have their cake and eat it too they can't say oh there's no world government
[01:36:35.520 --> 01:36:40.960]  and then call for world government like george mambiat does all the time they can't have it both
[01:36:40.960 --> 01:36:48.800]  ways and he goes on to say that i will not link to alex's video yeah he he doesn't want you to see
[01:36:48.800 --> 01:36:54.320]  it he didn't want you to see what i actually said he wants to build a straw man about what i said i
[01:36:54.320 --> 01:37:00.800]  want to have this guy on jonah learner or learer however you pronounce his name let's go to paul
[01:37:00.800 --> 01:37:04.560]  watson briefly watson i've got you back up i know you're going out for a little bit but when you
[01:37:04.560 --> 01:37:11.920]  come back i want you to do a report dissecting this guy but with a key headline and i already had
[01:37:11.920 --> 01:37:17.120]  asked you to do you know do an overall report on this just showing how the pentagon says they're
[01:37:17.120 --> 01:37:21.760]  going to test this on the troops not just this vaccine but many others how the Gardasil killed
[01:37:21.760 --> 01:37:28.560]  people how these new generation of live viruses go in and do create plaques into the receptor
[01:37:28.560 --> 01:37:34.480]  site so that you can't absorb the aggressive triggering the aggression triggering hormones
[01:37:35.760 --> 01:37:39.760]  or quote drugs you know they're saying it's bad that we have these hormones
[01:37:42.560 --> 01:37:47.760]  so let's go ahead and talk to watson briefly about this watson do you basically get what i'm
[01:37:47.760 --> 01:37:55.040]  talking about here yeah well the thing about it is just today there's another article in
[01:37:55.040 --> 01:37:59.680]  wired news that talks about how the army are going to be injected with a vaccine that alters their
[01:37:59.680 --> 01:38:06.560]  dna so this kind of stuff's going on it's being proposed for us but now it's a conspiracy theory
[01:38:06.560 --> 01:38:14.480]  according to this wired writer i mean you've got the white house signs are saying sterilized people
[01:38:14.480 --> 01:38:20.880]  by putting you know sterilants in the water supply and uh i suppose that's a conspiracy theory as well
[01:38:20.880 --> 01:38:28.480]  and suddenly there's literally hundreds of publications pushing hundreds literally hundreds
[01:38:28.480 --> 01:38:33.680]  of new vaccines that go in with viruses and what do viruses do they kill tissue
[01:38:35.360 --> 01:38:40.480]  literally going into alter our brains and then he quotes here he says now for the bad news
[01:38:40.480 --> 01:38:44.800]  apparently one of the most popular google trends searches for august 3rd was brain eating vaccine
[01:38:44.800 --> 01:38:53.520]  and he goes on to quote that the daily mail did take 400 words out of his article interviewing
[01:38:53.520 --> 01:38:58.400]  the scientist and said to create a vaccine that will eliminate feelings of stress i was quoting
[01:38:58.400 --> 01:39:04.400]  the interview based on the mail article the kind of people who are worried about world
[01:39:04.400 --> 01:39:08.880]  governments are conspiring to sterilize and are pacify the populations of their drugs in waste
[01:39:08.880 --> 01:39:15.840]  in water supplies conclude that the scientist is working to rid us of our emotions via his vaccine
[01:39:15.840 --> 01:39:21.440]  project well that's what it said it said we've got hormones in us that make us upset and aggressive
[01:39:21.440 --> 01:39:26.320]  and anxiety and this will cure that with a virus that goes in and attacks the receptors
[01:39:27.040 --> 01:39:31.680]  and then he goes on to say well the vaccine could be used you know to uh to help rats that
[01:39:31.680 --> 01:39:36.960]  have had strokes well whatever we quoted what the scientist and the writer said that was their main
[01:39:36.960 --> 01:39:42.160]  rollout and saying oh the public will be able to get this soon like it was the new wonder toy or the
[01:39:42.160 --> 01:39:48.560]  new christmas toy or the new widget everybody's got to have well i mean watson isn't this good news
[01:39:48.560 --> 01:39:56.640]  though that we've drawn them out to attack us now well the thing about it is he implies that
[01:39:56.640 --> 01:40:03.600]  proposals to put um lithium in the water supply are also fictional mystical conspiracy noise you
[01:40:03.600 --> 01:40:09.920]  know fantasies when that's what the japanese talked about it was in the bvc it's linked to in our
[01:40:09.920 --> 01:40:18.000]  original article lithium in water curb suicide and they said that um large-scale trials involving
[01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:24.400]  the addition of lithium to drinking water may be feasible well well jonah lear jonah lear or
[01:40:24.400 --> 01:40:30.480]  lear however you pronounce it this guy is a bioethicist he studies neuroscience and psychology
[01:40:30.480 --> 01:40:35.360]  that we said is taking over regular medical science and he's a road scholar i mean it's on
[01:40:35.360 --> 01:40:42.160]  record cesil roads created south africa and rhodesia it's on record that cesil roads wanted a world
[01:40:42.160 --> 01:40:48.240]  government and and and recruited people like bill clinton and others i mean his system did i mean
[01:40:48.240 --> 01:40:54.240]  this guy's incredible well he's obviously a protégé of the elite i mean he's an oxford
[01:40:54.240 --> 01:40:59.520]  graduate he's a road scholar and he's coming out with this kind of stuff and one of his fellow
[01:40:59.520 --> 01:41:05.280]  travelers the oxford bioethicist came out this week and called for lithium in the water and prozac
[01:41:05.280 --> 01:41:10.800]  in the water i mean they're all over the place and he's saying he knows nothing about it we're crazy
[01:41:10.800 --> 01:41:18.480]  paul the naked body scanners aren't being stored even though it's now admitted well as he said it's
[01:41:18.480 --> 01:41:25.120]  a straw man it's a playground infill article you know it's what four or five of paragraphs that he's
[01:41:25.120 --> 01:41:31.280]  written and it's just a puff piece so um good luck with it but as he said all the comments well the
[01:41:31.280 --> 01:41:38.960]  majority of them at least see right through it man i tell you paul this is incredible
[01:41:41.200 --> 01:41:47.200]  this is just this is just amazing well listen i want you to do a i know what you do is quickly as
[01:41:47.200 --> 01:41:53.600]  you can a basic piece just full of links and documentation i've read the patents and of these
[01:41:53.600 --> 01:41:59.040]  vaccines uh he's claiming i'm just talking about this vaccine now i was going off the headline
[01:41:59.040 --> 01:42:02.960]  saying oh it'll make you not get upset or angry anymore oh it's going to be so wonderful
[01:42:02.960 --> 01:42:09.440]  now he's trying to spin that but that's what they say this is for it's it's the countless abc cbs cnn
[01:42:09.440 --> 01:42:14.960]  about vaccines to cure drug addiction and then if you just search the term vaccine to cure drug
[01:42:14.960 --> 01:42:23.200]  addiction viral plaques or viruses plug up neuro receptors that's how they spin it when you
[01:42:23.200 --> 01:42:26.480]  actually read the patents and i'll try to search these and send them to you to help you with the
[01:42:26.480 --> 01:42:31.040]  research because i've read them over the years i mean imagine these viruses go in and literally
[01:42:31.040 --> 01:42:35.680]  attack neurons but they're saying well it's not good that you get upset and so we're going to
[01:42:35.680 --> 01:42:42.480]  reprogram this is cognitive enhancement just like cbs news says mercury is a cognitive enhancer
[01:42:42.480 --> 01:42:49.040]  helping children behave better see how they spin it brain damage is now behavior brain damage is now
[01:42:49.040 --> 01:42:59.200]  helping yeah these um these ones to stop drug addiction as he said all about stopping things
[01:42:59.200 --> 01:43:04.480]  from reaching receptors in your in your brain so how can that be anything else than altering the
[01:43:04.480 --> 01:43:10.400]  very structure of your brain that's exactly what these vaccines are about it's amazing we've got
[01:43:10.400 --> 01:43:14.800]  michael kaufman coming up we may have to back him up a little bit to the last 40 minutes because
[01:43:14.800 --> 01:43:20.800]  i was on man cal show which is on over 200 stations this morning and he's seen the articles in the news
[01:43:21.440 --> 01:43:25.760]  about you know how they're drugging the water what the vaccines are doing and he really had a good
[01:43:25.760 --> 01:43:30.000]  rant breaking it down how he can see the public's already been brain damage and i wanted to get him
[01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:35.280]  briefly on he scheduled to call in any time we got kaufman coming up loaded phones as well
[01:43:36.400 --> 01:43:41.440]  but watson just do a good job and point out that he did a straw man that we did quote what he said
[01:43:41.440 --> 01:43:46.720]  what the scientists said and that it's it's it's this whole family of vaccines and the other wired
[01:43:46.720 --> 01:43:54.480]  article about troops about troops and how they're going to test shots where there's over 100 vaccines
[01:43:54.480 --> 01:43:59.040]  per injection and how they go in and alter the brain i mean this is serious business and they
[01:43:59.040 --> 01:44:03.680]  want to just come out like they roll everything out like it's for your safety and it's good
[01:44:03.680 --> 01:44:08.720]  we're here at the inception i've known about this for a decade preemptively blowing their program
[01:44:08.720 --> 01:44:16.240]  to bits and uh so i hope listeners realize this is the big issue god bless you watson what's the
[01:44:16.240 --> 01:44:25.760]  eta on the article a couple of hours probably so by like four o'clock central yeah we're counting
[01:44:25.760 --> 01:44:31.280]  on you watson have steve do his own from his own perspective hit him and hit him hard all right all
[01:44:31.280 --> 01:44:35.840]  right good job we're in a fight with this road scholar we're in a fight with these globalists
[01:44:35.840 --> 01:44:44.640]  and we're gonna we're gonna expose them and and i challenge him to come on this show i challenge him
[01:44:47.760 --> 01:44:53.920]  this leer to come on the broadcast and where i can sit here with stacks of government documents
[01:44:53.920 --> 01:44:59.280]  and patents and their own reports and read it to him i can literally print a stack this high
[01:44:59.280 --> 01:45:02.320]  and just sit there and go what about this study what about this patent what about this report
[01:45:02.320 --> 01:45:06.480]  what about this what about that but that's why i bet you he won't come on this show but we're
[01:45:06.480 --> 01:45:13.280]  going to put the invitation out to the associate editor of wired we're going to do that uh mark
[01:45:13.280 --> 01:45:20.640]  in texas you're on the air well great day today we took it after some stuff here i um wanted to
[01:45:20.640 --> 01:45:25.600]  give some details uh facts on some things here um i didn't think you were going to take me that
[01:45:25.600 --> 01:45:32.800]  quick um that fell is pretty good that watching fell out both of them wow um i have some research
[01:45:32.800 --> 01:45:38.080]  i've been in this field a while and i want to put a a jab to this little freaking kook that came
[01:45:38.080 --> 01:45:41.760]  on excuse my language i've been trying not to hold up and up all night studying on this and do
[01:45:41.760 --> 01:45:45.040]  some other things i've been in this field but i wanted to research a little bit more before i gave
[01:45:45.040 --> 01:45:49.440]  y'all you're talking about all these bioethicists coming out in the new york times and everywhere
[01:45:49.440 --> 01:45:53.680]  else saying we want to put lithium in your water whether you like it or not well yeah i want to hit
[01:45:53.680 --> 01:45:57.520]  on specifically the lithium thing and then i want to hit on something that we can all do
[01:45:57.520 --> 01:46:01.280]  being with my background and i was working at colonic centers and other places and things like
[01:46:01.280 --> 01:46:12.880]  that so um yes sir um first thing is um this um this lithium thing uh this guy is nut that came
[01:46:12.880 --> 01:46:16.320]  on there he's a murderer basically because no one in their right mind and the government will
[01:46:16.320 --> 01:46:20.080]  probably never do well they're pretty crazy because these are new world people these crazy
[01:46:20.080 --> 01:46:25.040]  people are running everything and they're ignoring everything about god and here's what goes on with
[01:46:25.040 --> 01:46:30.880]  the lithium here then in in the states we only have one place that gets it naturally reserved
[01:46:30.880 --> 01:46:36.240]  reserved and that's in the el paso of course everybody knows that but it comes in pico doses
[01:46:36.240 --> 01:46:42.800]  which is very very small amount tiny tiny amount very small um you get up any further than that
[01:46:42.800 --> 01:46:48.160]  you start getting toxicity people that move there that have mental conditions because they move there
[01:46:48.160 --> 01:46:52.880]  because it's cheaper than buying the lithium from other people and it's naturally put into the water
[01:46:52.880 --> 01:46:58.480]  and it's more stable that you know god's way of doing it these people it would usually take them
[01:46:58.480 --> 01:47:02.800]  six months to build that up and then their metabolism would keep that small amount to where it would
[01:47:02.800 --> 01:47:07.200]  need to be because our body will naturally get rid of exactly i gotta i gotta let you go mark but
[01:47:07.200 --> 01:47:14.480]  yes that's what dr blalock top brain surgeon said it builds up even in microscopic amounts to then
[01:47:14.480 --> 01:47:19.680]  become something that makes you servile and passive they're talking about much higher levels
[01:47:19.680 --> 01:47:25.760]  continually just like fluoride that build up and build up now i want to go to the man known as man
[01:47:25.760 --> 01:47:32.240]  cal um eric and he's uh here with a syndicated radio broadcaster but i was on with him this morning
[01:47:32.240 --> 01:47:37.680]  and i know this is one of his big hot button issues now they've gone from denying sodium fluoride
[01:47:37.680 --> 01:47:41.680]  is put in the water to make a servile to saying they want to put lithium in and we've got studies
[01:47:41.680 --> 01:47:47.600]  they're already adding it uh in with the sodium fluoride and now we have wired magazine uh as
[01:47:47.600 --> 01:47:54.320]  well as uh you know what we just covered uh the daily mail and others coming out and saying
[01:47:54.320 --> 01:47:59.520]  they they're coming out with vaccines that go in and cure drug addiction by destroying your natural
[01:47:59.520 --> 01:48:04.000]  neurons that will accept the drugs which then you can't have your own endorphins and now wired
[01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:10.800]  magazine has come out and called me a liar and it turns out this guy is a road scholar who who
[01:48:10.800 --> 01:48:17.600]  has written this report and studies uh and writes about the brain and in this article at the end
[01:48:17.600 --> 01:48:23.600]  he says alex jones is a liar but in the article he admits that in the in the news articles i
[01:48:23.600 --> 01:48:29.280]  quoted they did say in the headline in fact find that mail headline it was uh you know shots to
[01:48:29.280 --> 01:48:33.760]  make you calm deal with stress they admit that's what's going on here but they say it's for your
[01:48:33.760 --> 01:48:40.640]  own good you shouldn't be upset about it uh man cal what's your view on this well alex uh all right
[01:48:40.640 --> 01:48:45.920]  i thought this is such a big topic let me let me let me start and you're gonna think this is crazy
[01:48:45.920 --> 01:48:50.880]  let me let me just start my father was the mayor of lakers new jersey uh i've got newspapers of him
[01:48:50.880 --> 01:48:55.440]  with uh john f canady uh he was around the time they were putting fluoride in the water that he
[01:48:55.440 --> 01:49:00.400]  heard from different political sources how dangerous this was my whole life i heard my father talk
[01:49:00.400 --> 01:49:05.200]  about fluoride and how evil it was and that the government had some plan that if you ate fluoride
[01:49:05.200 --> 01:49:10.160]  you would die and uh he was quite controversial for fighting fluoride he never would allow us to
[01:49:10.160 --> 01:49:15.840]  fluoride because of that i should tell you that my dental bills have been awful but uh he's worked
[01:49:15.840 --> 01:49:20.880]  till the day he died that uh it was it was deadly stuff now let me fast forward here to the last
[01:49:20.880 --> 01:49:27.280]  few years alex uh when i was 15 years old or 16 or in my in my 20s whatever all i thought about was
[01:49:27.280 --> 01:49:33.920]  girls and i see um i see these young men now they're not they're not interested and i talked to
[01:49:33.920 --> 01:49:38.640]  young women you know different college interns on my stupid radio show and no the guys around
[01:49:38.640 --> 01:49:43.360]  have said around to play video games and watch tv like zombies now i live in the city of chicago
[01:49:43.360 --> 01:49:46.080]  i'm putting all this together i know this sounds like i'm all over the place but i'm sitting in
[01:49:46.080 --> 01:49:51.760]  chicago and you see these people just walk right out of the traffic they're like cattle and everything
[01:49:51.760 --> 01:49:56.800]  that's going on and nobody gets upset everybody's calm the boys are docile now i remember the teachers
[01:49:56.800 --> 01:50:01.520]  attacking masculinity and he went to public school the last 50 years remember how the teachers
[01:50:02.160 --> 01:50:06.960]  would would attack masculinity so i thought is that it but these girls are you know these
[01:50:06.960 --> 01:50:12.720]  girls and boys you know the boys aren't interested in in being with girls or passive where where is
[01:50:12.720 --> 01:50:19.120]  is it masculinity whenever america needs a man to be a man in a movie wherever we need a masculine
[01:50:19.120 --> 01:50:27.600]  man we go to australia or new zealand right are you there no i'm listening to you well man cow in
[01:50:27.600 --> 01:50:32.000]  all these reports in all i mean we're about to go to break stay with us but in all these reports
[01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:38.000]  they admit they want to make us passive they want to make us servile they admit now they want to put
[01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:43.120]  it in there to make a servile and when you study the water supplies they're already adding it they

[01:54:56.480 --> 01:55:04.000]  i've since researched it it i mean it's perfect it's it's uh you know a tattle sheeple uh followers
[01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:09.760]  obama voters kool-aid drinkers and and buddy i'm telling you you're in austin texas i'm in
[01:55:09.760 --> 01:55:16.960]  chicago and it's it's like zombies i see human beings but they're they're dead they walk out
[01:55:16.960 --> 01:55:21.280]  into the street you haunt your horn they look over there there's nothing going on in their eyes
[01:55:21.280 --> 01:55:26.880]  and if you felt it in america these people uh stumbling through life i and and and i mean
[01:55:26.880 --> 01:55:32.240]  young beautiful girls uh interns on my show and guys don't ask them out guys don't want to sleep
[01:55:32.240 --> 01:55:37.360]  with them and and then i meet the young men i mean we were we were ready to rock and roll ready to
[01:55:37.360 --> 01:55:42.320]  party ready to be with women there i mean i'm not trying to be to be x-rated here are rated
[01:55:42.320 --> 01:55:48.880]  i mean to be honest when i was was about 1112 i literally began like a wolf salivating when
[01:55:48.880 --> 01:55:55.600]  i saw women and every 24 7 it was all about and by the time i was 13 i was very successful
[01:55:56.160 --> 01:56:03.440]  going after women and now you don't see this buddy i i mean me too it's look so what is going on
[01:56:03.440 --> 01:56:09.120]  when you have an 18 year old guy uh a 20 you know these college guys and they're not interested
[01:56:09.120 --> 01:56:12.800]  they're not they're they're not homosexual i thought well maybe they had been brow beaten
[01:56:12.800 --> 01:56:19.280]  but it's all of them look around america people are stumbling through life what is it is it is
[01:56:19.280 --> 01:56:24.080]  it chemicals in the water well it very well may be is it the chemicals in the meat it very well
[01:56:24.080 --> 01:56:29.120]  may be something is going on and of course masculinity is under attack by our media and the
[01:56:29.120 --> 01:56:34.800]  school teachers uh you know look i had a guy on and he was telling me i'm ridiculous i i i like
[01:56:34.800 --> 01:56:40.320]  having uh uh you know my immunity system built up and i don't do this this stuff all the time
[01:56:40.320 --> 01:56:44.880]  this uh this hand gel you know and i think it's i think it's gonna it's gonna really hurt us
[01:56:44.880 --> 01:56:49.760]  it all these you know these gels these antibiotic gels i think it's killing our immune system and
[01:56:49.760 --> 01:56:54.640]  he was telling me what an idiot no no that's now admitted in major studies yeah i said i said eat a
[01:56:54.640 --> 01:56:59.040]  spoonful of it eat a spoonful of it i'll give you a hundred dollars he goes no my father said the
[01:56:59.040 --> 01:57:03.520]  same thing uh back in the day when they started why do we need anything in our water now we have
[01:57:03.520 --> 01:57:06.960]  to spend a bunch of money to get the floor right out of our water why is the government
[01:57:06.960 --> 01:57:12.640]  putting a poison in our water you can't eat floor right it will kill you so my father fought this
[01:57:12.640 --> 01:57:16.880]  his whole life and because of it yes we have cavities i had to fight that other kids that had
[01:57:16.880 --> 01:57:22.480]  uh uh uh floored in their water they didn't have any cavity so i was kind of mad at my father but
[01:57:22.480 --> 01:57:27.440]  now i think about it no wonder i'm angry i have the ability to get angry no wonder i get upset
[01:57:27.440 --> 01:57:33.280]  at injustice i i see it and um because i wasn't allowed for i did some of these other chemicals
[01:57:33.280 --> 01:57:40.880]  so so maybe that's it maybe that's why we see so many zombies obama that just kind of stumbled
[01:57:40.880 --> 01:57:54.000]  through life and hey hey alex yes i uh you know he called this is not manpower alex jones uh obama

[02:02:07.280 --> 02:02:13.760]  calm and yeah i i wondered why why aren't people getting upset at all the injustice as we see our
[02:02:13.760 --> 02:02:20.480]  country uh systematically destroyed hey i had to laugh uh this is off-subject jc jaron mccain has
[02:02:20.480 --> 02:02:24.640]  come out against the stimulus from the tarp remember remember this is the same guy that had to
[02:02:24.640 --> 02:02:29.680]  quit his campaign so that he could ensure that tarp went through and now he's against it well
[02:02:29.680 --> 02:02:34.080]  same thing with obama he was with the key guy that got the congressional black caucus to push for it
[02:02:34.080 --> 02:02:40.000]  and then he's acted like he's been against it i mean it's it's it's an outrage and it's nonsense
[02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:45.120]  and uh but see being outraged is a mental illness they say that in all these reports and now they
[02:02:45.120 --> 02:02:50.400]  say they're going to test these mind-altering vaccines on the troops man cow a mosque at ground
[02:02:50.400 --> 02:02:56.800]  zero how dare you ask a question a pedophile is your boy scout counselor how dare you ask a question
[02:02:56.800 --> 02:03:02.320]  how dare you even think that you know let me tell you something alex remember this the uh and and
[02:03:02.320 --> 02:03:06.800]  i think it's a liberal thing you think it's it's it's you know big government but but it's it's
[02:03:06.800 --> 02:03:12.640]  correct in our society and it's it's the phrase who's to say who's to say a mosque at ground zero
[02:03:12.640 --> 02:03:17.520]  is is wrong who's to say that that you know their religion is better than our religion who's to say
[02:03:17.520 --> 02:03:23.200]  that their country is better than us who's to say that a baby aborted today for nine months is wrong
[02:03:23.200 --> 02:03:28.960]  who's to say so they never you know it's obama and that's his followers they never can say what's
[02:03:28.960 --> 02:03:34.400]  right and what's wrong you have the guts here on the radio at least ask the questions and
[02:03:34.400 --> 02:03:39.520]  and say things are wrong when you see him it's just amazing this moral equivalency you know they
[02:03:39.520 --> 02:03:43.600]  say you're not allowed they say you're not allowed to have an opinion but then they're
[02:03:43.600 --> 02:03:49.120]  going to have their opinion and they're going to force drug you if they want yeah um uh mel Gibson

[02:07:57.040 --> 02:08:03.440]  this information is too important to wait the genesis communications radio network probably
[02:08:03.440 --> 02:08:16.880]  presents the alex jones show because there's a war on for your mind well he's a big part of our film
[02:08:16.880 --> 02:08:21.280]  in game blueprint for global enslavement i think it's the most important film i've made
[02:08:21.280 --> 02:08:27.200]  close to three hours long and on the expanded extras he reads from major university studies
[02:08:27.200 --> 02:08:32.320]  how they were openly saying that they were drugging and were going to drug the population by the year
[02:08:32.320 --> 02:08:40.080]  2000 to make us a servile population now the huffington post the new york times bbc are saying
[02:08:40.080 --> 02:08:46.960]  the japanese the u.s government and others the national uh you know sinners uh at the federal
[02:08:46.960 --> 02:08:53.360]  government let me just read you the quote here uh from the u.s national institutes of health
[02:08:53.360 --> 02:08:59.680]  are looking at vaccines that will quote change our brain chemistry with a live herpes virus this is
[02:08:59.680 --> 02:09:04.800]  just one of hundreds of vaccines that do this that quote cure drug use other vaccines do that
[02:09:04.800 --> 02:09:11.200]  by attacking the receptor sites those receptors those drugs are mimicking normal endorphins
[02:09:11.200 --> 02:09:15.520]  you're meant to get angry at corruption you're meant to get outraged you're meant to be stressed
[02:09:16.240 --> 02:09:22.880]  you know if your child's dying of cancer they don't want you to be able to respond and eco science
[02:09:22.880 --> 02:09:29.200]  talks about drugging the water to sterilize you now in just the last hour a big report from
[02:09:29.200 --> 02:09:37.120]  wired magazine the frontal cortex by john lear who is a road scholar that's set up to create
[02:09:37.120 --> 02:09:42.560]  rural government he comes out and says i'm a liar and he says well yes my my earlier article you
[02:09:42.560 --> 02:09:47.040]  know was quoted as saying it'll make you calmer and make society happier is what the scientist says
[02:09:47.040 --> 02:09:52.080]  with this one vaccine one of many i mentioned but i won't show you the video alex created
[02:09:52.080 --> 02:09:57.040]  about this called brain eating vaccines uh no but most of the people in the comment section
[02:09:57.040 --> 02:10:02.640]  are attacking him and see through him but but this is so incredible so incredible they've gone
[02:10:02.640 --> 02:10:06.640]  from denying that they're doing this to our water to now saying it's for our own good and they want
[02:10:06.640 --> 02:10:13.600]  to give us vaccines that do this so i want to go to michael kaufman uh phd he is a published uh
[02:10:13.600 --> 02:10:18.000]  ecologist he's advised the federal and state governments he's the guy that shot down one of
[02:10:18.000 --> 02:10:22.640]  the big un takeovers in the 90s with the maps he put together from government documents about
[02:10:22.640 --> 02:10:27.200]  over half the country will be off limits to the population it's all covered in in-game
[02:10:27.200 --> 02:10:31.360]  blueprint for global enslavement he's produced several films exposing man-made global warming
[02:10:31.360 --> 02:10:35.920]  as a hoax four or five years ago when you still got attacked for doing it and the last two years
[02:10:35.920 --> 02:10:41.680]  he's released a new one they're all available at info wars dot com and his new book uh rescuing a
[02:10:41.680 --> 02:10:46.960]  broken america why america is deeply divided we'll talk about this some two with him but but he's
[02:10:46.960 --> 02:10:52.640]  spoken about this covert drugging that's in the government documents but now it's out in the open
[02:10:52.640 --> 02:10:58.720]  why do you think it's out in the open now well for many of the things that the the cartel had
[02:10:59.440 --> 02:11:06.320]  was fighting for us 20 30 years ago in secret uh is now basically being discussed because they
[02:11:06.320 --> 02:11:11.280]  i think they think it's too late for us to do anything about it and we are so dumbed down in
[02:11:11.280 --> 02:11:16.640]  our educational system for the last several generations that most people just say ho hum
[02:11:16.640 --> 02:11:21.040]  this business is useful and go on their way i think that in fact i remember right the quote that i
[02:11:21.040 --> 02:11:25.840]  used out of one of these government documents basically said that it was they were going to
[02:11:25.840 --> 02:11:30.720]  be able to be able to manipulate us with these kinds of drugs and so forth to the point where
[02:11:30.720 --> 02:11:36.320]  we'll be very docile and we won't even be able to respond when something i rate does come up
[02:11:37.680 --> 02:11:41.920]  and there's no doubt the public with the bisphenol a does the same thing sodium fluoride we had
[02:11:41.920 --> 02:11:47.440]  dr blalock on about it yesterday now the lithium they admit is to dumb us down and make a servile
[02:11:47.440 --> 02:11:52.560]  a toxic metal and they're moving ahead to do this and saying we're going to give you shots
[02:11:52.560 --> 02:11:58.240]  that alter you we know they've already been doing it lacing other vaccines and and and you know in
[02:11:58.240 --> 02:12:03.120]  in the film in the expanded extras of in game you talk about it you read the the u.s government and
[02:12:03.120 --> 02:12:09.120]  university quotes where they talked about their master plan uh huxley before he died to 62 he'd
[02:12:09.120 --> 02:12:14.080]  written brave new world revisited that was nonfiction and and he said all of this is what
[02:12:14.080 --> 02:12:18.720]  we're planning this is what we're going to do you're going to love your servitude and so you
[02:12:18.720 --> 02:12:24.000]  wonder why the public can't get upset uh and you wonder why cancer rates and infertility are off
[02:12:24.000 --> 02:12:30.320]  the charts this has been done by design i believe it has been too i think there's no doubt based
[02:12:30.320 --> 02:12:36.000]  on some of the things that i discussed on in game and other things out of the writings and so forth
[02:12:36.000 --> 02:12:42.640]  that i've done that they have these techniques of being able to calm down society and basically
[02:12:42.640 --> 02:12:50.640]  take our free will and you know god gives us free will but i guess uh you know god doesn't know what
[02:12:50.640 --> 02:12:55.440]  he's doing or the universe doesn't know what's going on it's up to these control freaks they
[02:12:55.440 --> 02:13:00.080]  are going to take our free will and that's what this does yes it does in fact some of that is in
[02:13:00.080 --> 02:13:06.480]  my new book the rescue to broken america well we're going to get into the book uh but you know that's
[02:13:07.680 --> 02:13:11.520]  dr blalock of course top brain surgeon agreed with you and he read the government's own quotes
[02:13:11.520 --> 02:13:17.760]  about brain damaging us yesterday that they think they've won uh because they see how they can get
[02:13:17.760 --> 02:13:23.680]  away with almost anything now uh and imagine if hitler or stalin or mal i mean they did have
[02:13:23.680 --> 02:13:29.440]  fluoride but but imagine if they would have had these more high tech systems uh i mean it's literally
[02:13:29.440 --> 02:13:34.160]  the end of our species if we don't reverse this yes it is and boy i'm telling you we're right at
[02:13:34.160 --> 02:13:40.000]  the very end now you and i have talked about this on your program for what five or six years now
[02:13:40.000 --> 02:13:44.400]  on different times that we're getting close well we're at that point now it's more than that i've
[02:13:44.400 --> 02:13:48.560]  been interviewing you for 12 years but yeah we've we've we've been okay it's been 12 years it could
[02:13:48.560 --> 02:13:54.400]  very well be it just in my memories so getting shorter oh no no i mean i mean i've been on air
[02:13:54.400 --> 02:13:59.680]  15 years and uh let's talk about some of your successes those people understand we can fight
[02:13:59.680 --> 02:14:05.280]  these people tell folks about how in the early 90s mid 90s you were able to get their documents on
[02:14:05.280 --> 02:14:12.160]  the wilding project and shoot down that un trading yes i was able to get both united nations uh federal
[02:14:12.160 --> 02:14:20.000]  as well as uh behind the scenes NGO non-government organization of of documents that said that the
[02:14:20.000 --> 02:14:25.920]  wildlands project was going to set aside one half the united states and other countries as well
[02:14:25.920 --> 02:14:31.680]  but into wilderness areas are interconnecting wilderness corridors and it was able to make
[02:14:31.680 --> 02:14:38.640]  those links back into the united nations convention on biological diversity back in the early 1990s
[02:14:38.640 --> 02:14:44.400]  when it came up for ratification in the u.s senate i went down to the senate explain this to some of
[02:14:44.400 --> 02:14:50.880]  the key senators they said holam because i couldn't prove that that's what it was designed to do and
[02:14:50.880 --> 02:14:56.640]  in august we sent out a fax alert which was the technology of the day shut it down collapsed the
[02:14:56.640 --> 02:15:03.520]  u.s senate phone line system and uh they brought it back up again in september and we did it again
[02:15:03.520 --> 02:15:11.120]  and it was still going to the floor for ratification and i was able to submit a map that i had drawn
[02:15:11.120 --> 02:15:17.120]  uh over the previous two years to the u.s senate they put it into a four by six foot poster took
[02:15:17.120 --> 02:15:21.680]  it out and was sent a four three o'clock in the afternoon the boat was for four o'clock and it
[02:15:21.680 --> 02:15:27.120]  would stop deadness tracks it's still there but it has nothing's been done on its end and i use that
[02:15:27.120 --> 02:15:33.680]  and the example not to elevate myself but to show you how god can intervene and how he can use
[02:15:33.680 --> 02:15:39.840]  individuals to be able to thwart this agenda and i think we're at that point right now in this whole
[02:15:39.840 --> 02:15:45.600]  effort to basically take over and get the last vestiges of the constitutional protections away
[02:15:45.600 --> 02:15:51.760]  from you and i in this next election if we don't stop it in this next election or stop it at least
[02:15:51.760 --> 02:15:58.960]  blow it down uh it's going to be too late well i want to go to another point uh the rockefellers
[02:15:58.960 --> 02:16:05.760]  over a hundred years ago they didn't like charity so they invented uh the philanthropist
[02:16:05.760 --> 02:16:12.720]  and and they and and and this is mainline history they invented uh the tax-free foundation
[02:16:13.520 --> 02:16:18.480]  and they sold the public oh you're breaking up our trust in 1906 we're not going to have monopolies
[02:16:18.480 --> 02:16:23.200]  now but then it comes out the rockefellers still own the major oil companies now they're allowing
[02:16:23.200 --> 02:16:31.760]  the new super rich uh like michael bloomberg uh and uh baron hilton and bill gates and others
[02:16:31.760 --> 02:16:37.920]  and in fact we have that times of london headline super rich meat and secret to talk about population
[02:16:37.920 --> 02:16:42.480]  control well you guys pull up that times of london super rich meat and secret to talk about
[02:16:42.480 --> 02:16:48.000]  population control and so they've met again for population control and they're all pledging
[02:16:48.000 --> 02:16:53.520]  30 billionaires uh to give large portions in some cases more than half their wealth
[02:16:53.520 --> 02:16:58.080]  to the bella melinda gates foundation and david rockefellers pledged more money but then when you
[02:16:58.080 --> 02:17:06.320]  read it the entire foundation is for nanotech vaccines mosquitoes that deliver vaccines so you
[02:17:06.320 --> 02:17:13.120]  can't say no a sterilization abortion here it is more billionaires sign the gates buffet pledge
[02:17:13.120 --> 02:17:18.000]  and and we'll pop that back up on screen billionaire club and bid to curb overpopulation
[02:17:18.000 --> 02:17:21.680]  i mean this isn't a game i mean they're moving against us they believe the planet's theirs
[02:17:21.680 --> 02:17:27.040]  they want us out of the way yes they do there is no question about that i was unaware of what
[02:17:27.040 --> 02:17:32.160]  you just said but it fits very nicely within their game plan well we're about to go to break
[02:17:32.160 --> 02:17:36.720]  but let's start getting into rescuing a broken america we do sell it by the way at info wars.com
[02:17:36.720 --> 02:17:42.800]  so you support michael koffman phd and of course this operation but uh i mean the book it really is
[02:17:42.800 --> 02:17:49.280]  like a laundry list it's a great read it's got solutions but also documentation about the globalist
[02:17:49.280 --> 02:17:54.640]  global warming fraud it just covers it all briefly give us a synopsis of the book well originally
[02:17:54.640 --> 02:17:59.040]  it was over a thousand pages long i condensed it down to about 200 pages so if you're really
[02:17:59.040 --> 02:18:03.600]  interested in a specific issue you know i don't go into it very much depth but it gives you the
[02:18:03.600 --> 02:18:09.520]  broad paintbrush of what the globalists have done over the last 100 years to bring us to where we are
[02:18:09.520 --> 02:18:14.480]  right now and how it's being manifest in the obama administration who is doing it what
[02:18:14.480 --> 02:18:20.000]  institutions they've taken away how they have basically constituted various deep division
[02:18:20.000 --> 02:18:26.080]  that we have in the united states and what they've done with property rights to nullify them because
[02:18:26.080 --> 02:18:30.560]  property rights are the key to wealth creation there's no way around it and then finally some
[02:18:30.560 --> 02:18:37.600]  all ideas as to how we can confront this starting in november and and this is an ongoing culture
[02:18:37.600 --> 02:18:43.760]  war against the collectivist dehumanizing eugenicist and free humanity and your book's not going to
[02:18:43.760 --> 02:18:47.680]  be the total solution in games not going to be the total solution obama deception isn't going
[02:18:47.680 --> 02:18:53.520]  to be the total solution my new videos you know the secret of food exposed food the ultimate
[02:18:53.520 --> 02:18:59.440]  secret exposed but all of it together our willingness to resist everything the controllers do
[02:18:59.440 --> 02:19:05.520]  is about pacifying us that shows they understand they're not invincible that's right and they are
[02:19:05.520 --> 02:19:10.320]  vulnerable and they're vulnerable right now probably the most that they'll ever be if we do not take
[02:19:10.320 --> 02:19:15.360]  advantage of it that's right because they've come out in the open obama has fallen flat on his face
[02:19:15.360 --> 02:19:20.320]  there's a huge awakening the patriots that really know what's going on we've got to get into the tea
[02:19:20.320 --> 02:19:27.760]  parties and everywhere else and really supercharge people's awakening yes there's no question of that
[02:19:27.760 --> 02:19:33.040]  i go into the book on that and obviously you're talking about it many of the radio hosts are
[02:19:33.040 --> 02:19:38.240]  talking about it uh people are getting fired up well the biggest issue we've got to face just how
[02:19:38.240 --> 02:19:43.200]  horrifying our situation is so many people are victims of crime because they can't believe it's
[02:19:43.200 --> 02:19:48.240]  happening to them it does happen it is happening here the book is rescuing a broken america why

[02:20:02.960 --> 02:20:08.000]  should consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily
[02:20:08.000 --> 02:20:13.360]  double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control how much power
[02:20:13.360 --> 02:20:18.800]  your electric company allows you to have it's true total government control of electricity in the name
[02:20:18.800 --> 02:20:24.080]  of smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[02:20:24.080 --> 02:20:29.360]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem
[02:20:29.360 --> 02:20:34.480]  number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families
[02:20:34.480 --> 02:20:39.040]  lose their power from weather-related onages number five a solar power generator provides
[02:20:39.040 --> 02:20:43.600]  powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks i really believe in the solar power generators

[02:24:21.920 --> 02:24:30.320]  writing about doesn't quote calm the public well i've got his quotes in the mainstream news article
[02:24:30.320 --> 02:24:35.440]  right here jab that could put a stop to stress without slowing us down with a live virus that
[02:24:35.440 --> 02:24:41.360]  goes in and attacks the receptors so we're going to do something tomorrow with him just be ready
[02:24:41.360 --> 02:24:46.240]  for it we're writing a big article about it today to exposing you know this video has been one of our
[02:24:46.240 --> 02:24:52.320]  bestsellers and i'm excited because a global warming emerging science and understanding really
[02:24:52.320 --> 02:24:58.560]  details by dr michael kaufman who's on with us the fraud of it great video to give people that's
[02:24:58.560 --> 02:25:04.240]  available but why i'm so excited about rescuing a broken america why america is deeply divided
[02:25:04.240 --> 02:25:08.960]  this is an olive branch to conservatives and liberals to show how they've been manipulated
[02:25:08.960 --> 02:25:14.880]  through divide and conquer and michael was telling me that liberals mainline liberals that read this
[02:25:14.880 --> 02:25:20.640]  book are really getting woken up by it and upset and it's shifting their paradigm uh tell us about
[02:25:20.640 --> 02:25:25.440]  some of those testimonies and why the books having such a big effect well one of the things that
[02:25:25.440 --> 02:25:30.560]  liberals do is they shut you down anything that you might say almost as soon as you say it i have
[02:25:30.560 --> 02:25:35.760]  approached this book as being open minded i don't support democrats anymore the republicans you don't
[02:25:35.760 --> 02:25:41.280]  either i know but at the same point at the same time i'm not pointing the finger at any one group
[02:25:41.280 --> 02:25:45.920]  i'm just basically saying well this is what's happening and we need to do something about it
[02:25:45.920 --> 02:25:51.200]  and one of the things that it does if you can get past the first couple pages the liberal can get
[02:25:51.200 --> 02:25:56.480]  past the first couple pages without throwing it down on the floor uh he will be or she will be
[02:25:56.480 --> 02:26:01.760]  hooked by almost guaranteed i've heard from enough of them to now to realize if they're a bit open
[02:26:01.760 --> 02:26:07.520]  minded and the most liberals are it's that small you know 10 or 15 percent that are closed minded
[02:26:07.520 --> 02:26:11.200]  they've got the solutions of the world already figured out they're going to ram them down your
[02:26:11.200 --> 02:26:16.480]  throat regardless of what you think uh most of the liberals are not the progressive hardcore
[02:26:16.480 --> 02:26:22.800]  progressives that are making up our our government and so forth and they will start to be able to
[02:26:22.800 --> 02:26:27.440]  see this i mean there's enough question in their mind now that what obama is doing and so forth
[02:26:27.440 --> 02:26:33.040]  and the fail policies that he's doing and i take advantage of those throughout that really starts
[02:26:33.040 --> 02:26:40.000]  to drive home the point and i hear globalism is destroying our society it is and now for the first
[02:26:40.000 --> 02:26:45.600]  time probably they can see it in this book uh you know i again if you're really well versed
[02:26:45.600 --> 02:26:50.320]  in a particular area you're going to find this book is still fairly fairly shallow but as far
[02:26:50.320 --> 02:26:56.400]  as reaching people who do not understand it it basically does that and puts it connects to all
[02:26:56.400 --> 02:27:02.240]  the dots and they can see it for the first time i want to read a quote from the book show me the
[02:27:02.240 --> 02:27:08.720]  age and country where the rights and liberties of the people were placed on the sole chance
[02:27:08.720 --> 02:27:17.360]  of the rulers being good men without a consistent loss of liberty i say that the loss of the dearest
[02:27:17.360 --> 02:27:25.680]  privilege has always followed with absolute certainty every such mad attempt patrick henry
[02:27:25.680 --> 02:27:32.480]  i mean we know what happens when we give our freedoms up we know and now these people are so arrogant
[02:27:32.480 --> 02:27:36.880]  they're coming out saying they're going to publicly drug the water supply to make a submit
[02:27:36.880 --> 02:27:43.040]  and give us shots to make us happy i mean holy mackerel this is serious it's very serious and one
[02:27:43.040 --> 02:27:50.240]  of the things that i really leave pretty heavily on was the writings of a a psychiatrist 30 years 40
[02:27:50.240 --> 02:27:56.800]  years experience in doing studies and so forth with a liberal mind in fact that's what this book
[02:27:56.800 --> 02:28:03.040]  is is called and basically he says that these people are psychologically ill and as a consequence
[02:28:03.040 --> 02:28:08.800]  they cannot make a connection to reality they are so far out in what they believe that the
[02:28:08.800 --> 02:28:14.160]  belief is true that anything that connects it to reality is purely to happen champ and that's
[02:28:14.160 --> 02:28:18.560]  and that's how they can come out and say we're setting up world government but you people are
[02:28:18.560 --> 02:28:23.600]  kooks no world government exists or yes we're storing your naked body images but we're not
[02:28:24.480 --> 02:28:30.400]  absolutely i i totally agree with you it is all kinds of disconnect if you really look at what
[02:28:30.400 --> 02:28:37.440]  they're doing in congress and what their ideas are like you know really promoting islam and so forth
[02:28:37.440 --> 02:28:45.120]  well how can they promote islam when the the islamic law and so forth is so abusive to women
[02:28:45.120 --> 02:28:52.720]  there's a disconnect there and yet they do it well the globalist want to destroy the dominant
[02:28:52.720 --> 02:28:59.200]  culture of christianity yes real christianity not the fake christianoid and so they'll use anything
[02:28:59.200 --> 02:29:06.560]  that's from the outside to create divisions absolutely you cannot basically take over or
[02:29:06.560 --> 02:29:12.240]  change a a inherent cultural belief without first tearing it down and that's what they're in the
[02:29:12.240 --> 02:29:17.680]  process of doing it and they're basic they're deconstructing the american way and putting
[02:29:17.680 --> 02:29:23.440]  something else in its place and it's based on the the writings and so forth of ging jock we're
[02:29:23.440 --> 02:29:29.360]  still a frenchman in the 1800s that led to the french revolution and led to the beheading of

[02:34:08.560 --> 02:34:13.360]  than any nightmare science fiction and he read document after document from the federal government
[02:34:13.360 --> 02:34:18.640]  where they admitted the fluoride gives us cancer and brain damage where their own scientists say
[02:34:18.640 --> 02:34:25.600]  take it out i mean i love everybody i love the children i love our communities and these eugenicists

[02:35:30.880 --> 02:35:38.000]  this going back to dr michael kaufman dot continuing you know everybody i talked to
[02:35:38.000 --> 02:35:44.080]  who's really studied history understands that eugenics began 2300 years ago with playdough
[02:35:44.080 --> 02:35:52.480]  and he said we the hybrids the elite must kill everyone in greece who's poor and wars aren't
[02:35:52.480 --> 02:35:58.000]  killing them fast enough and we need to train them not to fight back against us so we'll give
[02:35:58.000 --> 02:36:04.000]  them sports uh as a way to be the new hero we got to kill these people you can read the quotes and
[02:36:04.000 --> 02:36:10.400]  play those republic and then if you study history you see it come back and be picked up in the 1760
[02:36:10.400 --> 02:36:17.360]  70s 80s 90s and of course then they put napoleon after that it was a Rothschild takeover they were
[02:36:17.360 --> 02:36:23.760]  going to have a 10 day a week work week they were going to abolish the family this is mainline history
[02:36:24.320 --> 02:36:29.440]  they were talking about force drugging people they were saying they wanted to kill 80 percent that
[02:36:29.440 --> 02:36:34.240]  number comes from the french revolution kill 80 percent of the public and so without me even
[02:36:34.240 --> 02:36:39.520]  prompting it we talked about it yesterday here's michael kaufman telling you the same thing go over
[02:36:39.520 --> 02:36:44.720]  the french revolution it was the opposite of what our revolution was and george washington
[02:36:44.720 --> 02:36:48.960]  figured that out when he was president and spoke out against it and the french then tried the
[02:36:48.960 --> 02:36:53.280]  illuminati he wrote letters about it he wrote letters about him trying to overthrow the united
[02:36:53.280 --> 02:36:59.440]  states and so ever since then it is a group of sages or people that understand how humans operate
[02:36:59.440 --> 02:37:07.680]  who want to end the regular human order and replace it with their new world order uh dr go over it
[02:37:07.680 --> 02:37:11.920]  absolutely it is one of those heinous things that when you think about it
[02:37:11.920 --> 02:37:16.320]  where you have people who are at the very top now the vast majority of troops out there and
[02:37:16.320 --> 02:37:21.600]  try and implement this agenda don't really fully understand what they're doing but the key people
[02:37:21.600 --> 02:37:28.080]  behind it like a current in the french revolution which was orchestrated by the illuminati and
[02:37:28.080 --> 02:37:35.680]  a jake the jacobian society and so forth they basically used the russo model with the russo
[02:37:35.680 --> 02:37:41.600]  model basically means the state is in control over the individual or sovereign over the individual
[02:37:41.600 --> 02:37:47.200]  and everything stems from that once they did that anybody who disagreed with them
[02:37:47.200 --> 02:37:52.560]  had their head cut off and it was one of the most bloody revolutions in the history of the period
[02:37:53.280 --> 02:38:01.360]  both jefferson and patrick henry were excited about the french revolution until they went over
[02:38:01.360 --> 02:38:07.040]  there and actually saw what they were doing it had nothing in comparison to the america and one
[02:38:07.040 --> 02:38:12.960]  of them almost got killed some of our founding fathers got locked up actually patrick henry
[02:38:12.960 --> 02:38:18.400]  basically was scheduled to have his head locked off if it wasn't for the intervention of washington
[02:38:18.400 --> 02:38:24.560]  and the request to having sent home and jefferson himself intervene uh otherwise he would have
[02:38:24.560 --> 02:38:30.160]  been beheaded for all the outrageous not really outrageous to us but all that he was saying against
[02:38:30.160 --> 02:38:33.760]  the french revolution and they were going to have a new calendar they were going to end the family
[02:38:33.760 --> 02:38:39.440]  the good news is it stalled out and failed it stalled out and failed although we still have
[02:38:39.440 --> 02:38:45.440]  the socialist government that russo is based upon installed in france it just hasn't evolved
[02:38:45.440 --> 02:38:52.160]  that's right carl marx carl marx and others they were plagiarizing uh what the luciferians and by
[02:38:52.160 --> 02:38:57.600]  the way that's mainline history that the illuminati out of germany came over to france uh that's what
[02:38:57.600 --> 02:39:02.720]  the famous magic flute symphonies all about and then of course uh you know they killed that
[02:39:02.720 --> 02:39:07.280]  composer when he did it that was his last piece i mean this is for those that haven't read mainline
[02:39:07.280 --> 02:39:14.240]  history i mean these were human sacrificing devil worshiping mass murderers if they really were and
[02:39:14.240 --> 02:39:18.480]  of course that's been obliterated if you look at the history books today that you might get in high
[02:39:18.480 --> 02:39:22.880]  school or college of course that that will not be in there but if you look at some of the older
[02:39:22.880 --> 02:39:29.120]  history books the ones that you can still get it and buy you will find a more accurate just like
[02:39:29.120 --> 02:39:33.840]  nazi germany if you look at nazi germany history in the current textbooks and so forth you will
[02:39:33.840 --> 02:39:38.880]  find anything about the religious beliefs of hitler the theosophical beliefs of his blur and
[02:39:38.880 --> 02:39:44.560]  what led him to believe that the the jews were a bad race they had to be eliminated all of that
[02:39:44.560 --> 02:39:51.280]  stuff is now sanitized out of our history books but if you go back to the more uh a hundred years
[02:39:51.280 --> 02:39:57.600]  ago or even 50 years ago history books what you will find is really what the truth is in
[02:39:57.600 --> 02:40:03.600]  that particular period of time these people are evil they're evil down to the very core
[02:40:03.600 --> 02:40:08.000]  i think you're a con your discussion your description of them as being luciferian is
[02:40:08.000 --> 02:40:14.720]  right on target well and and then you look at eugenics in england in the 1850s that then got
[02:40:14.720 --> 02:40:20.400]  set up in the us and hitler got his ideas from that and it's the very same crowd it's a very
[02:40:20.400 --> 02:40:26.240]  same crowd uh and it's based it's still in the united nations is still boiling just below the
[02:40:26.240 --> 02:40:32.160]  surface you don't see it named at that anymore but it's still there the deep population of the world
[02:40:32.160 --> 02:40:37.760]  the whole effort is eugenics well now more and more they're coming out of the open and uh you
[02:40:37.760 --> 02:40:44.160]  know calling for only having one child uh having the state takeover children uh let's talk more
[02:40:44.160 --> 02:40:50.400]  about what's in your book all right i mean go because there's so much to cover what else do you
[02:40:50.400 --> 02:40:54.880]  think is important to do well one of the things that is i think extremely important is to realize
[02:40:54.880 --> 02:41:00.080]  and maybe this will get your attention because it gets your pocketbook the 13 and a half trillion
[02:41:00.080 --> 02:41:06.880]  dollar deficit that we now have is directly directly responsible for this whole mentality
[02:41:06.880 --> 02:41:12.640]  this whole ideology which we now call progressivism our extreme liberalism whatever you want to call
[02:41:12.640 --> 02:41:21.040]  it it is the whole idea that government can solve all the problems in the nation and eventually the
[02:41:21.040 --> 02:41:28.880]  world and as a consequence there these people do not believe that man has a downside a dark side
[02:41:28.880 --> 02:41:34.720]  they believe that all mankind will do his best to get given the right opportunity and of course
[02:41:34.720 --> 02:41:39.440]  that's fallacious it's totally anti-biblical not only that but it's never worked wherever
[02:41:39.440 --> 02:41:45.360]  it's been tried and yet they continue to believe that man is inherently good he does not have a
[02:41:45.360 --> 02:41:51.120]  human nature that will be manifest itself in the form of greed or power seeking or anything else
[02:41:51.120 --> 02:41:56.480]  and all they need to do is to strive to create the perfect government to create the perfect man
[02:41:56.480 --> 02:42:02.400]  it does not work and in the process of course you're going to create a power vacuum in which these
[02:42:02.400 --> 02:42:07.920]  uh very evil people can sweep right in and begin to control and go integrate that in quite great
[02:42:07.920 --> 02:42:13.040]  depth in the book and understanding helping people to understand the type of thing that they're
[02:42:13.040 --> 02:42:19.920]  creating by allowing this extreme liberalism in the form of law and cultural practices
[02:42:20.320 --> 02:42:28.160]  uh the whole concept of of uh oh come on um i can't think of it but anyway this
[02:42:28.160 --> 02:42:34.480]  a down along those lines moral relativism moral relativism is all right in there and that they
[02:42:34.480 --> 02:42:38.400]  can create the perfect government the reason we have poverty around the world is because
[02:42:38.400 --> 02:42:43.680]  of bad government especially the united states the united states is responsible for all evil
[02:42:43.680 --> 02:42:48.720]  done in the world uh if that's their belief i mean that's the solid in their belief system
[02:42:48.720 --> 02:42:54.720]  and as a consequence they're doing all they can to tear down the constitutional republic
[02:42:54.720 --> 02:43:00.560]  that our founders created and build up a substitute government in its place that's
[02:43:00.560 --> 02:43:06.400]  tied totally into this roostal socialism and this idea that the perfect man can be created
[02:43:09.120 --> 02:43:12.880]  well i want to be believable it is unbelievable i want to go to some phone calls and they'll be
[02:43:12.880 --> 02:43:16.800]  all over the map but you can speak to any of these issues because you're a deep researcher
[02:43:16.800 --> 02:43:22.080]  dr michael coffman is our guest and of course the new book rescuing a broken america why america
[02:43:22.080 --> 02:43:26.880]  is deeply divided very important and of course his film dealing with global warming all available
[02:43:26.880 --> 02:43:30.640]  at info wars dot com michael in florida thanks for holding your on the air
[02:43:33.120 --> 02:43:39.280]  go ahead uh michael you're on the air okay let's move on victoria in montana you're on the air
[02:43:40.320 --> 02:43:45.440]  hi alex hello welcome thank you i just want to say before i tell you real quick because i know
[02:43:45.440 --> 02:43:51.040]  you only have one minute per person we will not allow these fallen ones to turn us into mechanization
[02:43:51.040 --> 02:43:56.800]  man and cut off our connection to god with their chemical biological warfare so i wanted
[02:43:56.800 --> 02:44:02.720]  to answer um your question what can we do well we can dismantle wall street and the federal
[02:44:02.720 --> 02:44:08.560]  reserve criminal bankers and make them accountable like everyone else no more double standards put
[02:44:08.560 --> 02:44:14.480]  them in prison um we could have people organize state to state get the number of signatures
[02:44:14.480 --> 02:44:21.680]  needed on petitions to dump the criminal criminal politicians then we could get out of the united
[02:44:21.680 --> 02:44:28.560]  nations which is nothing but another big criminal organization and uh then we can strip the power
[02:44:28.560 --> 02:44:35.440]  and control from big corporations and foundations and end outsourcing our industries we could end
[02:44:35.440 --> 02:44:42.480]  tax funded mandatory public schools which allow parents the freedom of choice then to truly and
[02:44:42.480 --> 02:44:47.840]  rightfully educate their children how they see fit and stop taking our money for it because it's
[02:44:47.840 --> 02:44:52.720]  nothing but a cesspool i know because i was there for a little while and said no thank you
[02:44:52.720 --> 02:44:59.600]  um prosecute politicians that fail to follow the law and replace them with leaders that will
[02:44:59.600 --> 02:45:05.280]  rebuild and make sure that they're legal and good for the country and the people before they make
[02:45:05.280 --> 02:45:13.280]  them laws um allow people to choose their senators and have the power to dump them as needed and
[02:45:13.280 --> 02:45:19.680]  take back our our basic freedoms of speech of press of religion of assembly and our
[02:45:20.480 --> 02:45:25.520]  right to our private property which we really don't have right now anymore beautifully and
[02:45:25.520 --> 02:45:29.040]  beautifully said victoria and i would just have for people that just tuned in they're going allow
[02:45:29.040 --> 02:45:34.640]  us to choose our senators that will she means before the 17th amendment of 1913 when the
[02:45:34.640 --> 02:45:41.120]  bankers took over the state legislatures would uh vote you vote for them then they would vote
[02:45:41.120 --> 02:45:46.080]  making the senator a creature of the state that was meant to balance federal power you know you'd
[02:45:46.080 --> 02:45:51.040]  have the popularly elected house members and in the senate they'd be creatures of the state
[02:45:51.040 --> 02:45:55.680]  that was a major blow against states rights so you could recall i mean i've even read a you know
[02:45:55.680 --> 02:46:01.440]  famous stories about people like davie crockett being recalled to be griped out uh you know by
[02:46:01.440 --> 02:46:05.840]  his state when he was in the congress and we need to go back to that great points doctor
[02:46:05.840 --> 02:46:11.200]  uh copman any comments on that yes exactly the chief identifying exactly what needs to
[02:46:11.200 --> 02:46:16.400]  be done but it cannot be done until we get the right people in office and that can't happen
[02:46:16.400 --> 02:46:21.520]  until we educate the american people as to what's truly been going on you've been doing that for
[02:46:21.520 --> 02:46:27.120]  years alex this is book is designed to be able to give the people who are open minded you can't
[02:46:27.120 --> 02:46:32.240]  talk to anything about a closed minded person but to open minded liberals when you start to do that
[02:46:32.240 --> 02:46:36.880]  and they really start to get angry that's when you're going to start to see some good people
[02:46:36.880 --> 02:46:42.960]  being voted in the office and changes made exactly as victoria was describing beautifully said let's
[02:46:42.960 --> 02:46:49.120]  go to another caller here let's talk to fred in georgia you're on the air fred hey alex great
[02:46:49.120 --> 02:46:54.240]  show today thank you thank you sir um listen there's a lot of people that have been provably
[02:46:54.240 --> 02:47:02.480]  harmed by these activities um i think that one chance we have a getting back some power here is
[02:47:02.480 --> 02:47:08.240]  to file class action losses hey it's now coming out that they knew in 81 that prozac was causing
[02:47:08.240 --> 02:47:13.920]  brain damage heart problems and suicide and now elie lily and others are getting sued people are
[02:47:13.920 --> 02:47:19.440]  always bashing out of control lawyers but the problem is you can you fight fire with fire
[02:47:19.440 --> 02:47:24.720]  i agree i mean i mean here's a headline scientific study finds 40 of all store receipts
[02:47:25.600 --> 02:47:32.000]  covered in dangerous hormone disrupting chemical they chose a plastic form of ink that does that
[02:47:32.000 --> 02:47:37.280]  we have the government documents they need to be sued over this you have you have millions of
[02:47:37.280 --> 02:47:42.320]  listeners that would gladly sign up to be plaintiff you have export witnesses like you're just now
[02:47:42.320 --> 02:47:48.480]  on dr playlock you know we could bankrupt them possibly put them in jail and ruin their carefully
[02:47:48.480 --> 02:47:53.440]  crafted you know image and it would get a lot of attention from the media as well well again
[02:47:53.440 --> 02:47:59.680]  they weaponized all the food almost all the packaging uh but i mean it's an idea for others
[02:47:59.680 --> 02:48:06.800]  to go out and for lawyers and people uh you know to to stop this to stop notice all these chemicals
[02:48:06.800 --> 02:48:13.360]  always disrupt aggression and fertility notice all these things you keep hearing about they only
[02:48:13.360 --> 02:48:18.800]  deal with that that these chemists study this with rats then they have the big foundations
[02:48:18.800 --> 02:48:23.120]  deploy this and then the average company buying this stuff they don't know they're compartmentalized
[02:48:23.120 --> 02:48:28.160]  i appreciate your call dr kaufman comments on that absolutely again well however remember many
[02:48:28.160 --> 02:48:32.640]  of your attorneys are these progressives they're not going to take your cases they're not going to
[02:48:33.520 --> 02:48:37.760]  be able to help you or even want to they'll probably do everything stand to dissuade you or
[02:48:37.760 --> 02:48:43.040]  if they take your case they'll deliberately lose it so be careful as to which attorneys
[02:48:43.040 --> 02:48:49.120]  are law firms you hire to do this and then also recognize that the judicial system itself has
[02:48:49.120 --> 02:48:55.360]  been highly compromised with this mentality this ideology and we need to be careful of the judges
[02:48:55.360 --> 02:49:00.320]  that we have and that's only going to take that's going to take time to to recall some of these
[02:49:00.320 --> 02:49:04.400]  judges impeach them get them out of office won't take very many before the rest of them get the
[02:49:04.400 --> 02:49:09.760]  hand but this is these are the things that we really do need to do i think your idea of a
[02:49:09.760 --> 02:49:15.680]  legal action is ideal just be aware that the system is against you in the process be aware
[02:49:15.680 --> 02:49:20.640]  of the pitfalls but regardless it educates people uh let's talk to uh mike and louisiana you're on
[02:49:20.640 --> 02:49:28.240]  the air mike thank you gentlemen um three things i want to go over here real quickly uh one the
[02:49:28.240 --> 02:49:36.160]  last time i talked to you alex about the spring of the chemicals on the uh shoreline here yeah
[02:49:36.160 --> 02:49:43.920]  that's now admitted the uh core exit yes sir um it so happens that uh wane mattson was in town
[02:49:43.920 --> 02:49:51.120]  at that time an associate of him uh of his got a hold of me i got to week meet wane and he spent
[02:49:51.120 --> 02:49:56.880]  three days going over the material i was able to put him in contact with and he wrote a nice
[02:49:56.880 --> 02:50:03.920]  article about that good though that's nice uh one thing i want to pass by uh about uh what is
[02:50:03.920 --> 02:50:11.520]  going on here with the two of you gentlemen is something they call um the cleverness of the
[02:50:11.520 --> 02:50:18.720]  insanity of the crimes that are being committed in the sense that the crimes are so outrageous
[02:50:18.720 --> 02:50:26.640]  they are so insane and this particularly is true with i find the upper middle class professionals
[02:50:26.640 --> 02:50:33.680]  they find it extremely hard to believe the level of the crime if you were to bring it up to and you
[02:50:33.680 --> 02:50:41.520]  bring it up to them they're the insanity of the crimes themselves are so outrageous as that your
[02:50:41.520 --> 02:50:48.960]  mind just rebels against it refuses to recognize that this is a very central point even myself at
[02:50:48.960 --> 02:50:54.400]  a subconscious level it's hard to believe now it's admitted we've got to accept the horror deal with
[02:50:54.400 --> 02:51:01.920]  deal with the horror face the horror take action great points more calls straight ahead hounded by

[02:53:59.520 --> 02:54:12.480]  the last caller hit the nail squarely on the head it's so unbelievable that 860 plus cities allow
[02:54:12.480 --> 02:54:18.320]  illegal aliens to be released over and over again not even arrested for drunk driving and every week
[02:54:18.320 --> 02:54:24.240]  or two i read about it in arizona or texas or uh those new ones in virginia where the illegal alien
[02:54:24.240 --> 02:54:29.600]  kills people the third fourth fifth time they're arrested you know they're finally arrested the
[02:54:29.600 --> 02:54:35.920]  third fourth fifth time when they kill somebody i've seen reports of like third time an illegal
[02:54:35.920 --> 02:54:40.880]  been stopped for drunk driving they ran into a cop car and almost killed the cop here it is virginia
[02:54:40.880 --> 02:54:46.640]  police illegal immigrant charged with killing none and injuring two others in car crash he'd been
[02:54:46.640 --> 02:54:52.480]  arrested three times i mean had not been arrested three times previously it just goes over the whole
[02:54:52.480 --> 02:55:01.440]  article but he's finally been arrested and charged uh but uh this is just insane how it's so bold
[02:55:02.240 --> 02:55:08.240]  how they just do it all in our face uh dr michael kaufman your comments on this it is and
[02:55:08.240 --> 02:55:12.240]  that's one of the things that i go over in the book in the fact that there is this serious
[02:55:12.240 --> 02:55:17.760]  psychological disconnect between what they believe and what is real what is reality there is a
[02:55:17.760 --> 02:55:22.960]  disconnect from reality how in the world can you justify having a system set up that will
[02:55:22.960 --> 02:55:28.000]  allow this kind of thing to go on if you and i were caught on driving three or four times
[02:55:28.000 --> 02:55:32.160]  we'd be put in jail they're just constantly released because it's the right thing to do
[02:55:32.880 --> 02:55:38.080]  it is insane as you're saying and the only way that we can begin to take our nation back
[02:55:38.640 --> 02:55:45.040]  initially is at the ballot box begin to really promote those candidates or support those candidates
[02:55:45.040 --> 02:55:50.720]  who are holding a constitutional position and in my suggestions as to how to solve this
[02:55:50.720 --> 02:55:55.680]  i give a list of things that you should be asking your candidate put them on the spot
[02:55:55.680 --> 02:56:00.160]  help them to understand that you're deadly serious about going back to the original
[02:56:00.160 --> 02:56:06.640]  constitutional intent of of having a limited form of government even a liberal people begin to
[02:56:06.640 --> 02:56:12.160]  get the hint i think after a while we are so the the president members of congress both
[02:56:12.160 --> 02:56:17.680]  senate and the congress itself are so disconnected that they they believe that you're the greatest
[02:56:17.680 --> 02:56:20.880]  things in slice bread while they're getting elected but once they're elected they could care
[02:56:20.880 --> 02:56:25.680]  less does you see congressman stark say this week that the federal government can quote do
[02:56:25.680 --> 02:56:32.320]  anything it wants to individuals yes let me and let me go ahead let me be specific though because
[02:56:32.320 --> 02:56:38.000]  i was looking at another case of any legal being released he'd been arrested twice for drunk driving
[02:56:38.000 --> 02:56:44.800]  he'd been let go in in other quote traffic wrecks and accidents so he'd been arrested and
[02:56:44.800 --> 02:56:54.320]  released and not arrested a whole bunch of times but twice for drunk driving and some of this went
[02:56:54.320 --> 02:57:04.400]  on two years ago i mean it just illustrates how criminal this government is yes it really does
[02:57:04.400 --> 02:57:09.200]  what was the point you were trying to make us we're almost out of time i don't remember
[02:57:10.480 --> 02:57:16.720]  no it's just more and more doc i'm just overwhelmed i mean i can't believe how insanely out of
[02:57:16.720 --> 02:57:21.200]  control the government and the globalist are how they're destroying the planet how they're doing
[02:57:21.200 --> 02:57:27.520]  all these dangerous things uh how they are so corrupt and i just i i guess that's it the
[02:57:27.520 --> 02:57:33.200]  average person just can't believe this is really happening no you're you can't it's so outrageous
[02:57:33.200 --> 02:57:39.920]  that you you have a you yourself a disconnect you can't believe it's happening you downplay it
[02:57:39.920 --> 02:57:44.640]  it is seriousness and because you're busy with your life and so forth you go on and don't actually
[02:57:44.640 --> 02:57:49.840]  do anything about it now is the time to get involved and begin to do something about it i can't
[02:57:49.840 --> 02:57:57.120]  over emphasize that enough we have the opportunity in november to begin to change this around and we
[02:57:57.120 --> 02:58:02.000]  have to do everything we can to do that well god bless you sir we appreciate you spending time
