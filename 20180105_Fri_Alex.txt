[00:00.000 --> 00:05.780]  We're going to kick this live Friday transmission off with an extremely important report from
[00:05.780 --> 00:10.260]  Paul Joseph Watson that puts everything in perspective of what we're dealing with with
[00:10.260 --> 00:15.860]  the left and how they're allied with any form of authoritarianism that enslaves men, women
[00:15.860 --> 00:21.420]  and children, but especially women, because women are the fount of life.
[00:21.420 --> 00:22.420]  Here it is.
[00:22.420 --> 00:26.740]  Courageous women across Iran are opposing an oppressive Islamic theocracy by removing
[00:26.740 --> 00:28.460]  their hijabs in public.
[00:28.460 --> 00:30.640]  And where's the pussy-hat crowd?
[00:30.640 --> 00:32.240]  Where are the western feminists?
[00:32.240 --> 00:33.400]  Oh, that's right.
[00:33.400 --> 00:37.760]  They just spent the last year fetishizing and normalizing the hijab.
[00:37.760 --> 00:42.920]  They spent the last year applauding global corporations for adorning athletes and Barbie
[00:42.920 --> 00:43.920]  dolls with it.
[00:43.920 --> 00:45.240]  They embraced the hijab.
[00:45.240 --> 00:49.160]  To such a degree, they literally made it the symbol of their resistance movement.
[00:49.160 --> 00:54.120]  How can you claim to represent women's rights when you're genuflecting to a symbol of oppression
[00:54.120 --> 00:56.480]  for women across an entire continent?
[00:56.480 --> 01:02.060]  The first thing women in Syria do when they're liberated from ISIS control is to remove
[01:02.060 --> 01:04.440]  their hijabs with glee.
[01:04.440 --> 01:10.000]  The very first Arab feminist groups 100 years ago discarded their hijabs in protest.
[01:10.000 --> 01:15.360]  Now Iranian women in 2018 are doing the same thing, beaten for it in the streets.
[01:15.360 --> 01:16.880]  And how does the left respond?
[01:16.880 --> 01:21.200]  With complete silence or even tacit support for the Islamic regime.
[01:21.200 --> 01:25.920]  How many times has the official pussy-hat women's march even tweeted about Iran?
[01:25.920 --> 01:26.920]  Oh, look!
[01:26.920 --> 01:27.920]  It's zero!
[01:27.920 --> 01:31.080]  Another case in point, the relentless cancer that is Buzzfeed.
[01:31.080 --> 01:35.400]  People are using an old image of a woman without a headscarf to illustrate the Iran protests.
[01:35.400 --> 01:36.400]  Old?
[01:36.400 --> 01:37.400]  Really?
[01:37.400 --> 01:38.400]  So how old is it, Buzzfeed?
[01:38.400 --> 01:39.400]  Six months?
[01:39.400 --> 01:40.400]  Two years?
[01:40.400 --> 01:41.400]  Five years?
[01:41.400 --> 01:45.000]  Oh, it's literally from last week, as you admit in your own article.
[01:45.000 --> 01:49.280]  It's from December 27th, just a week before you published the article.
[01:49.280 --> 01:54.240]  So you accuse me of misleading people when you're the ones misleading people by claiming
[01:54.240 --> 01:55.840]  an image is old.
[01:55.840 --> 01:56.840]  And it isn't even old.
[01:56.840 --> 02:02.200]  You're the ones literally spreading fake news to side with an oppressive Islamic theocracy
[02:02.200 --> 02:03.920]  against women's rights.
[02:03.920 --> 02:08.320]  Oh no, people are using a four-day old image of a woman spurning the forced, modesty culture
[02:08.320 --> 02:12.640]  of a misogynistic death cult that we peddle to our virtue, signaling white, guilt-ridden
[02:12.640 --> 02:16.680]  readership is empowering, and it's totally f***ing up our victim narrative.
[02:16.680 --> 02:21.320]  Buzzfeed claims that images of women removing their hijabs to protest against government
[02:21.320 --> 02:25.800]  laws which force them to wear hijabs have nothing to do with the anti-government protests.
[02:25.800 --> 02:29.760]  In fact, it's got so little to do with the anti-government protests that it literally
[02:29.760 --> 02:33.440]  became an iconic symbol of the anti-government protests.
[02:33.440 --> 02:35.320]  Who wrote this Buzzfeed piece?
[02:35.320 --> 02:36.320]  Rose Troop Buchanan?
[02:36.320 --> 02:40.920]  Yeah, let's check that white privilege, Rose, and listen to what actual Iranians have to
[02:40.920 --> 02:41.920]  say about this.
[02:41.920 --> 02:46.440]  I'm from Iran, and every day many women are arrested because they didn't cover their hair
[02:46.440 --> 02:47.440]  properly.
[02:47.440 --> 02:50.600]  If a woman doesn't wear a scarf at all, she will be lashed.
[02:50.600 --> 02:55.760]  The people of Iran have made this image a symbol of their resistance, but to many leftists,
[02:55.760 --> 02:59.520]  everything is about American politics and their opposition to the right.
[02:59.520 --> 03:05.280]  The world is bigger than the US Buzzfeed, you have taken the side of the theocrats against
[03:05.280 --> 03:06.280]  the oppressed.
[03:06.280 --> 03:10.840]  Yeah, a little more listening to people who are actually from the country, Buzzfeed, and
[03:10.840 --> 03:13.200]  a little less white-splanning, please.
[03:13.200 --> 03:17.880]  A little less throwing actual feminists under the boss with your fake news.
[03:17.880 --> 03:22.560]  And didn't you just know Miss Sharia Law is reasonable, Linda Sorsor would have to insert
[03:22.560 --> 03:23.560]  herself into this?
[03:23.560 --> 03:26.640]  Why does the right-wing suddenly care about women in the Middle East?
[03:26.640 --> 03:31.200]  They didn't care about the Roanjaya Muslims, yeah, except they did.
[03:31.200 --> 03:35.320]  And Sorsor herself only tweeted about it when it became a global news story.
[03:35.320 --> 03:40.280]  Hey, Linda, I was calling for women to liberate themselves of their burqas four years ago,
[03:40.280 --> 03:44.720]  and what were you doing, joking about how FGM victims like Ayan Hirsi Ali should have
[03:44.720 --> 03:46.400]  their vaginas removed?
[03:46.400 --> 03:50.880]  And you've got the nerve to call yourself a women's right, sabbaka.
[03:50.880 --> 03:54.160]  She's a fake feminist.
[03:54.160 --> 03:58.520]  Miss Sorsor is not interested in universal human rights.
[03:58.520 --> 04:00.680]  She's a defender of Sharia Law.
[04:00.680 --> 04:04.440]  Noticable that male far-right bloggers, commentators in the US and Europe are going viral by deciding
[04:04.440 --> 04:08.600]  who is and who isn't a true feminist in relation to the West's response to Iran's protests.
[04:08.600 --> 04:13.560]  Yeah, noticable how many far-left bloggers, commentators in the US and Europe are fetishising
[04:13.560 --> 04:19.000]  the hijab, a symbol of patriarchal oppression, while actual victims of patriarchal oppression
[04:19.000 --> 04:21.360]  in Iran liberate themselves of it.
[04:21.360 --> 04:25.600]  Hey, lefties, feminism isn't about virtue signalling on Twitter about how much you
[04:25.600 --> 04:26.600]  respect women.
[04:26.600 --> 04:31.440]  While you sexually abuse them behind the scenes, it's about literally risking incarceration
[04:31.440 --> 04:35.600]  and torture to stand up for actual women's rights.
[04:35.600 --> 04:39.040]  Drink it in, because this is what a real feminist looks like.
[04:39.040 --> 04:42.240]  This is what a real feminist movement looks like.
[04:42.240 --> 04:46.520]  It's not about your corporate feminist hijabi-friendly Islamophilia.
[04:46.520 --> 04:52.200]  It's about risking it all to be a beacon of true freedom and true liberation for women
[04:52.200 --> 04:55.320]  around the world.
[04:55.320 --> 05:00.920]  The globalist left is so evil, it's just hard to believe.
[05:00.920 --> 05:04.280]  Introducing Cell Force by InfoWar's Life.
[05:04.280 --> 05:08.360]  Cell Force focuses on mitochondria efficiency and protection.
[05:08.360 --> 05:11.120]  Mitochondria produce over 95% of your energy.
[05:11.120 --> 05:14.120]  They are your body's cellular engines.
[05:14.120 --> 05:18.440]  Cell Force helps promote your cellular energy production by supporting mitochondria, much
[05:18.440 --> 05:20.880]  like a cellular engine overhaul.
[05:20.880 --> 05:25.400]  Because when your mitochondria don't run at 100% efficiency, then they start producing
[05:25.400 --> 05:27.840]  reactive oxygen species.
[05:27.840 --> 05:33.000]  Top scientists agree that aging is most likely caused by cellular damage, resulting from
[05:33.000 --> 05:35.920]  these reactive oxygen species.
[05:35.920 --> 05:40.960]  The antioxidants found in Cell Force are some of the most powerful available on the market.
[05:40.960 --> 05:45.800]  The stronger the antioxidant, the better its ability to scavenge for these reactive oxygen
[05:45.800 --> 05:48.520]  species and other free radicals.
[05:48.520 --> 05:53.520]  Boost, protect, and adapt with Cell Force from InfoWar's Life.
[05:53.520 --> 06:20.520]  Head to infowarslife.com or call 1-888-253-3139.
[06:20.520 --> 06:27.840]  You know, Donald Trump over the weekend said something that really started to sink in for
[06:27.840 --> 06:31.840]  me right before we went live.
[06:31.840 --> 06:33.480]  Is it so true?
[06:33.480 --> 06:35.360]  The truth is powerful.
[06:35.360 --> 06:41.760]  And Trump operates unlike any statesman I've seen in modern history in the truth.
[06:41.760 --> 06:43.120]  And that's what's so refreshing about it.
[06:43.120 --> 06:49.760]  But he said, you know, the mainstream media really needs me to win in 2020.
[06:49.760 --> 06:54.600]  You guys had almost no ratings and it completely imploded until I came along and you're still
[06:54.600 --> 07:00.840]  a shadow of your former selves because you're fake news, but he said, you need me.
[07:00.840 --> 07:05.000]  And look at the economy, look at all of it.
[07:05.000 --> 07:08.760]  It's all roaring back and optimism and so many other good things.
[07:08.760 --> 07:15.240]  And Trump is delivering on what he said very sensible policies across the board and they
[07:15.240 --> 07:20.360]  are just flipping out, completely inverting all of this.
[07:20.360 --> 07:23.600]  And now Michael Wolfe known for yellow journalism.
[07:23.600 --> 07:32.240]  I mean, he's famous for festooning his news reports with outright fabrications like you
[07:32.240 --> 07:37.080]  hang ornaments on a Christmas tree.
[07:37.080 --> 07:44.800]  He's now come out and said he has no way to know if any of it's true.
[07:44.800 --> 07:53.480]  He's gone to say, quote, I'll do whatever is necessary to get the story.
[07:53.480 --> 07:57.600]  Wolf in journalist clothing, by the way, this guy looks so disingenuous.
[07:57.600 --> 08:01.240]  I saw a photo of him last night smiling and it reminded me of a piece I've been wanting
[08:01.240 --> 08:02.760]  to do for months.
[08:02.760 --> 08:06.680]  Guys go to Google images and get Brian Stelter smiling.
[08:06.680 --> 08:11.720]  It is the most disingenuous wolf like demon face I've ever seen.
[08:11.720 --> 08:12.960]  And then you look at Wolf.
[08:12.960 --> 08:18.760]  It looks like Wolf is Brian Stelter's real daddy.
[08:18.760 --> 08:20.840]  I'll come find it during the break because there's no way for you guys to know which
[08:20.840 --> 08:21.840]  ones I want.
[08:21.840 --> 08:22.840]  It's Brian Stelter.
[08:22.840 --> 08:23.840]  There it is.
[08:23.840 --> 08:24.840]  Oh my God.
[08:24.840 --> 08:27.520]  I mean, that is a horror movie cover.
[08:27.520 --> 08:29.960]  Seriously, he is scarier looking than at the clown.
[08:29.960 --> 08:33.960]  I mean, would you let your children anywhere near that psychopath?
[08:33.960 --> 08:37.200]  I mean, that is a psychopath right there.
[08:37.200 --> 08:39.000]  I mean, look at him.
[08:39.000 --> 08:40.000]  God.
[08:40.000 --> 08:44.840]  Oh, I mean, it just, it cries out danger, danger, alert, alert.
[08:44.840 --> 08:46.560]  I am a scumbag.
[08:46.560 --> 08:47.560]  I am filth.
[08:47.560 --> 08:49.360]  I am your enemy.
[08:49.360 --> 08:54.920]  And then you look at the photos of Wolf smiling and it's the only person I've ever seen that
[08:54.920 --> 08:59.400]  looks that creepy, man.
[08:59.400 --> 09:02.800]  It's a still image photo of him smiling the same way with that power trip looking his
[09:02.800 --> 09:03.880]  eyes.
[09:03.880 --> 09:05.400]  It's in Google images.
[09:05.400 --> 09:11.000]  Just type in Michael Wolf journalist, that's his cover and you'll see the Brian Stelter
[09:11.000 --> 09:12.000]  look.
[09:12.000 --> 09:13.920]  I believe he is related to Stelter.
[09:13.920 --> 09:15.280]  He's got to be.
[09:15.280 --> 09:22.320]  I mean, folks, I would literally not be able to finish my dinner if somebody walked over
[09:22.320 --> 09:26.520]  and talked to me that looked like these two guys and I'm sorry, they're not just lying
[09:26.520 --> 09:30.520]  anti-American scumbags that want to run us all on the ground because they're little
[09:30.520 --> 09:31.520]  men.
[09:31.520 --> 09:32.520]  They're pieces of crap.
[09:32.520 --> 09:34.840]  They think they're better than everybody.
[09:34.840 --> 09:35.840]  That's what it's about.
[09:35.840 --> 09:42.400]  It's the spirit of evil and we must break them.
[09:42.400 --> 09:46.160]  Anytime I need energy now, I'm hanging Wolf and Stelter and Hillary.
[09:46.160 --> 09:48.520]  She's a other person that's got the same demon look.
[09:48.520 --> 09:49.520]  I'm better than you.
[09:49.520 --> 09:50.680]  I'm smarter than you.
[09:50.680 --> 09:57.960]  I'm a ravenous piece of garbage and I'm going to hang all three of them on my office wall.
[09:57.960 --> 10:03.920]  In fact, I'm putting their faces up all over the office because I want people to know who
[10:03.920 --> 10:09.200]  the enemy is.
[10:09.200 --> 10:12.600]  Unbelievable.
[10:12.600 --> 10:14.760]  You guys still haven't found the one.
[10:14.760 --> 10:21.840]  It's a body shot of Wolf and he's looking down with that just that disingenuous predator
[10:21.840 --> 10:27.880]  look of I'm not even hiding the fact that I hate everybody and that I'm a piece of crap
[10:27.880 --> 10:32.520]  and that I want to abuse you and I want to lie to you and I want to hurt you.
[10:32.520 --> 10:38.240]  But then there's a disingenuousness where he thinks you don't know and it's like a joke
[10:38.240 --> 10:43.520]  that we're not in on and no, that's not it.
[10:43.520 --> 10:44.520]  It's a body shot.
[10:44.520 --> 10:50.680]  It's him kind of looking down and he's got that same smile as Stelter and these are photos
[10:50.680 --> 10:57.560]  that they themselves put out as publicity photos.
[10:57.560 --> 11:01.560]  I've tried to do joke photos like this to look disingenuous and I can make any face
[11:01.560 --> 11:02.560]  I want to.
[11:02.560 --> 11:10.680]  I can't pull it off because the eyes, Chico, it's always in the eyes and again, I am always
[11:10.680 --> 11:15.400]  following my gut from now on with people and just like Trump said and they got big scuddies
[11:15.400 --> 11:16.400]  out.
[11:16.400 --> 11:17.400]  You can tell if somebody's lying.
[11:17.400 --> 11:20.720]  You can tell if somebody's been sick even a few hours even though the virus or bacteria
[11:20.720 --> 11:22.120]  hasn't really replicated.
[11:22.120 --> 11:26.960]  Your brain is such a supercomputer that your first shallow approximation is not shallow.
[11:26.960 --> 11:30.760]  It's the deepest thing to paraphrase the president.
[11:30.760 --> 11:33.960]  But just look at Stelter again, put him on screen.
[11:33.960 --> 11:38.520]  I think this all the broadcast should be is just a photo of Stelter smiling.
[11:38.520 --> 11:44.280]  Oh, oh, oh my gosh.
[11:44.280 --> 11:47.120]  Oh, hell on earth.
[11:47.120 --> 11:48.480]  He wants to run your life.
[11:48.480 --> 11:54.520]  He wants to control every aspect of your life because he knows he is a cowardly degenerate
[11:54.520 --> 11:58.720]  sack of anti-human trash.
[11:58.720 --> 12:05.400]  I pledge before my Heavenly Father that I will resist them every way I can.
[12:05.400 --> 12:10.680]  These people are the literal demon spawn of the pit of hell.
[12:10.680 --> 12:12.000]  Look at him and you know what?
[12:12.000 --> 12:14.640]  He is better than you if you keep letting him run your life.
[12:14.640 --> 12:15.800]  He runs your kids.
[12:15.800 --> 12:16.960]  He runs the schools.
[12:16.960 --> 12:17.960]  He runs the banks.
[12:17.960 --> 12:25.680]  This guy, this spirit, this smiling, leering devil that thinks you can't see what he is.
[12:25.680 --> 12:27.720]  He is your enemy.
[12:27.720 --> 12:28.720]  Period.
[12:28.720 --> 12:35.480]  All the narcissistic devil worshiping filth.
[12:35.480 --> 12:37.040]  I see you enemy.
[12:37.040 --> 12:38.040]  I see you enemy.
[12:38.040 --> 12:39.040]  Enemy.
[12:39.040 --> 12:40.040]  Enemy.
[12:40.040 --> 12:44.360]  You are my enemy.
[12:44.360 --> 12:50.600]  And I swear total resistance to you with everything I've got.
[12:50.600 --> 12:57.680]  Disingenuous, fake, false, broke back, twisted, a defiler, a betrayer, a backer.
[12:57.680 --> 13:03.560]  A backstabber, a devil.
[13:03.560 --> 13:04.560]  You will pay.
[13:04.560 --> 13:05.560]  Yeah.
[13:05.560 --> 13:06.560]  You think I don't see your face, scum?
[13:06.560 --> 13:07.560]  You don't think I don't see you, Stelter?
[13:07.560 --> 13:08.560]  I see you.
[13:08.560 --> 13:09.560]  You understand me?
[13:09.560 --> 13:10.560]  I know what you think of me and my family.
[13:10.560 --> 13:11.560]  I see you.
[13:11.560 --> 13:12.560]  Right back.
[13:12.560 --> 13:13.560]  You understand that?
[13:13.560 --> 13:14.560]  You understand that, Stelter?
[13:14.560 --> 13:15.560]  Stelter.
[13:15.560 --> 13:16.560]  You will fall.
[13:16.560 --> 13:17.560]  You will not breathe.
[13:17.560 --> 13:34.440]  God is going to destroy you.
[13:34.440 --> 13:37.440]  Get him off the screen.
[13:37.440 --> 13:41.120]  God, they're so evil.
[13:41.120 --> 13:45.120]  Just please, God, free us from them.
[13:45.120 --> 13:48.120]  They're drunk on our children's blood for God's sake.
[13:48.120 --> 13:53.960]  Okay, I'm going to stop right now.
[13:53.960 --> 13:57.040]  I'm going to find the photo of a wolf.
[13:57.040 --> 14:01.880]  The author of the, I'm just giving you a little bit of how they feel about you, see?
[14:01.880 --> 14:07.120]  But not the same spirit from a spirit of will and strength against evil and recognizing
[14:07.120 --> 14:12.600]  evil and letting it know that you understand what it's up to and that you see it.
[14:12.600 --> 14:13.600]  You understand.
[14:13.600 --> 14:16.240]  Because they don't want to be identified, but they want to hang it out right there in
[14:16.240 --> 14:18.760]  front of you and not be identified like the Joker.
[14:18.760 --> 14:19.760]  I see it.
[14:19.760 --> 14:21.960]  I know what your real face is.
[14:21.960 --> 14:25.920]  Oh, they just absolutely love to hurt innocents.
[14:25.920 --> 14:30.360]  They just rub their hands together to break down civilization, to destroy families, to
[14:30.360 --> 14:35.160]  defile everything they can, and to deceive and to mislead.
[14:35.160 --> 14:37.720]  It's built their own universe of fraud.
[14:37.720 --> 14:45.720]  This is the compendium of their abomination desolation.
[14:45.720 --> 14:47.560]  Let me continue here for a second.
[14:47.560 --> 14:51.760]  The author of the explosive new Trump book says he can't be sure parts of it are true
[14:51.760 --> 14:53.960]  and just does whatever it takes to get in the nose.
[14:53.960 --> 14:56.800]  Oh, there you go.
[14:56.800 --> 15:00.920]  So he just runs around and, you know, when I knew he was such a charlatan, according
[15:00.920 --> 15:07.640]  to his own words, basically, Mr. Wolfie, that Mr. Wolf in journalist clothing as their
[15:07.640 --> 15:08.640]  thing.
[15:08.640 --> 15:13.120]  And I said, oh, Bannon certainly is going to say he's been misquoted, and this was hyperbole
[15:13.120 --> 15:17.560]  or he was juxtapositioning or he was devil's advocate, because, you know, I wore game things
[15:17.560 --> 15:21.480]  here on air and the media takes it out of context, even though 20 seconds before I said,
[15:21.480 --> 15:24.840]  I don't really believe this, but this is how they basically see it.
[15:24.840 --> 15:25.840]  And that's how they deceive.
[15:25.840 --> 15:26.840]  It's what they do.
[15:26.840 --> 15:32.760]  They're of their father, the devil, a spirit they worship.
[15:32.760 --> 15:38.400]  They don't want you to know that it's all real and that they are literal on their belly
[15:38.400 --> 15:39.400]  snakes.
[15:39.400 --> 15:43.120]  Now, I see the snakes in the grass.
[15:43.120 --> 15:44.120]  We will stand against them.
[15:44.120 --> 15:49.640]  I'm going to compose myself, but we'll be right back on the other side as we expose
[15:49.640 --> 15:59.400]  these wolves, these beasts that go about roaring, seeing who they may devour, stay with me.
[15:59.400 --> 16:01.000]  Fully cooked, ready to eat bacon.
[16:01.000 --> 16:05.840]  I'm talking thick meaty, center cut, presidential bacon, savory and delicious.
[16:05.840 --> 16:06.840]  I buy some.
[16:06.840 --> 16:07.840]  I use some.
[16:07.840 --> 16:08.840]  I store some.
[16:08.840 --> 16:09.840]  Awesome.
[16:09.840 --> 16:15.560]  No refrigeration needed with a 10 year shelf life, NASA pack technology, bacon, fully cooked,
[16:15.560 --> 16:21.160]  fully hydrated, ready to eat right from the pack bacon, or warm and served, life saving,

[16:29.160 --> 16:31.800]  Most people think life insurance pays after you're dead.
[16:31.800 --> 16:32.800]  That's true.
[16:32.800 --> 16:36.560]  But did you know you can have tax free access to your life insurance while you're still
[16:36.560 --> 16:37.800]  alive?
[16:37.800 --> 16:41.400]  You can use the life benefits of your life insurance to grow your money with certainty
[16:41.400 --> 16:43.000]  and guarantees.
[16:43.000 --> 16:47.280]  No stock market risk, no tax risk and no penalties.
[16:47.280 --> 16:51.120]  Call life benefits if you'd like a free book about how this can be done.
[16:51.120 --> 16:59.320]  Call 702-660-7000, that's 702-660-7000.
[16:59.320 --> 17:04.320]  Heart disease is on the rise, clogged arteries, high blood pressure and high cholesterol levels
[17:04.320 --> 17:07.960]  may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[17:07.960 --> 17:12.960]  Loss of energy, blood sugar, spikes and drops, poor circulation and irregular heartbeat are
[17:12.960 --> 17:16.520]  just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[17:16.520 --> 17:21.040]  Remember how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives
[17:21.040 --> 17:22.040]  across America.
[17:22.040 --> 17:25.920]  My blood pressure has normalized, my diabetes has totally improved.
[17:25.920 --> 17:29.640]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much
[17:29.640 --> 17:30.640]  healthier I feel.
[17:30.640 --> 17:33.240]  I recommend heart and body extract to everyone.
[17:33.240 --> 17:38.440]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative
[17:38.440 --> 17:40.920]  to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.

[18:09.320 --> 18:13.360]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern
[18:13.360 --> 18:17.720]  Mexico where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[18:17.720 --> 18:23.040]  We have now managed to secure these sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.

[18:34.560 --> 18:36.680]  that so many other coffees give me personally.

[18:41.680 --> 18:43.720]  to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.

[19:00.480 --> 19:06.840]  Brett Smith, author of Thump, The First Bundred Days, explained to people about Thump and
[19:06.840 --> 19:09.240]  why this is an important book and how it ties into things.
[19:09.240 --> 19:11.520]  And I just thought to myself, you know, this is brilliant.
[19:11.520 --> 19:16.200]  This is the ultimate juxtaposition of what everyone says about the president.
[19:16.200 --> 19:21.480]  You know, they say that he's a racist, misogynist, sexist, bigoted, homophobic Nazi, so what
[19:21.480 --> 19:26.280]  better way to counter that than by turning him into an incredibly cute, lovable, fluffy
[19:26.280 --> 19:27.280]  little bunny?
[19:27.280 --> 19:30.640]  He's got that fun, rhyming structure to it.
[19:30.640 --> 19:31.640]  It's actually hilarious.
[19:31.640 --> 19:32.640]  I was cracking up reading the whole book.
[19:32.640 --> 19:33.640]  My wife was cracking up.
[19:33.640 --> 19:34.640]  And it's a great book for adults.
[19:34.640 --> 19:36.240]  It's a great book for children.
[19:36.240 --> 19:37.440]  We're selling the book.
[19:37.440 --> 19:43.280]  We've got it bundled as well here with a one-off poster that's a collector's item.
[19:43.280 --> 19:48.360]  Both of these, the book, the graphic novel, and the poster are $29.95 that helps support
[19:48.360 --> 19:49.360]  us.

[19:52.840 --> 20:03.520]  InfoWars for a limited edition at InfoWarsStore.com.
[20:03.520 --> 20:13.440]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[20:13.440 --> 20:22.080]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[20:22.080 --> 20:28.400]  People like Hillary Clinton like to hurt people.
[20:28.400 --> 20:37.800]  Fake journalist, this wolf in the hen house, Michael Wolf, people like him enjoying the
[20:37.800 --> 20:43.360]  climate of fake news media, corporate media, and the open season on the truth, open season
[20:43.360 --> 20:50.840]  on the president, open season on loyal, decent, hardworking, honorable folks.
[20:50.840 --> 20:56.040]  Open season because the trash knows it's being taken out, and so the trash is fighting for
[20:56.040 --> 21:04.160]  its political, cultural, and spiritual life, and its life is culturally ruling us.
[21:04.160 --> 21:11.160]  Leftist, globalism, allied with Islam, as Paul Watson's report on InfoWars.com breaks
[21:11.160 --> 21:18.120]  it down, is allied with radical Islam and is saying it isn't feminist to take your
[21:18.120 --> 21:25.080]  hijab off, and the women standing up getting shot and killed in Iran, in places like Tehran.
[21:25.080 --> 21:32.400]  They're not good, and Iran and the Mullahs are good.
[21:32.400 --> 21:33.400]  Paul Watson lays it out.
[21:33.400 --> 21:39.760]  News articles, videos, progressive left, there's the title, progressive left, embraces the
[21:39.760 --> 21:46.080]  hijab while actual feminists in Iran remove it to fight oppression, and in some cases
[21:46.080 --> 21:51.600]  get tortured and killed and shot, but it's hundreds dead now.
[21:51.600 --> 21:57.120]  But that's okay, because see, making a woman wear a hood over her head or cutting her genitals
[21:57.120 --> 22:00.040]  off is liberal, because that's what liberals want.
[22:00.040 --> 22:04.040]  If they can't cut your womb out, and they can't butcher your baby in the womb, they're
[22:04.040 --> 22:07.560]  going to try to brain damage it with all their vaccines and their fluoride and all the garbage.
[22:07.560 --> 22:13.080]  They admit that's their plan, because they're all about hurting children, and they like
[22:13.080 --> 22:19.040]  this modern form, this radical form, and this, in some cases, orthodox form of Islam that
[22:19.040 --> 22:25.080]  sells women at sex auctions, and CNN won't even say it's an Islamic thing that's happening.
[22:25.080 --> 22:28.880]  Imagine if churches were in North Africa selling women on slave blocks, you'd hear all about
[22:28.880 --> 22:34.280]  the denomination, their religious leader, why they do it, how it's wrong, but they won't
[22:34.280 --> 22:39.280]  even say to Islam, what you're doing is wrong.
[22:39.280 --> 22:43.760]  Because they don't want a reformation.
[22:43.760 --> 22:50.120]  Ladies and gentlemen, they want Islam to be used as a system to control people, and that's
[22:50.120 --> 22:56.680]  why it's not even Islam, it's political evil, just like leftist garbage is political evil,
[22:56.680 --> 23:02.720]  and that's who they are, and the smiley-faced demons out there like Brian Stelter and Michael
[23:02.720 --> 23:10.680]  Wolfe and Michael Moore, they're all gonna point at our champion who is in the center
[23:10.680 --> 23:18.600]  of the arena under massive attacks and whole balconies, whole cacophonies, whole lines
[23:18.600 --> 23:27.760]  of these carrion crows, these buzzards, these vultures, these rotten flesh-eaters.
[23:27.760 --> 23:37.120]  They sit up there and all crow and cackle in chorus that we're bad, and we're fake,
[23:37.120 --> 23:43.280]  and we're evil, when you judge a tree by its fruits, all we deliver is the news before
[23:43.280 --> 23:44.800]  it's ever forced out.
[23:44.800 --> 23:51.960]  All we deliver is the cutting edge, all we deliver is danger to them.
[23:51.960 --> 23:57.920]  All we deliver is the reality of people that aren't intimidated and aren't lying down and
[23:57.920 --> 24:03.880]  aren't taking their crap anymore.
[24:03.880 --> 24:09.560]  And I just read where Tony Blair says, I never told them this, I never said the things Wolfe
[24:09.560 --> 24:15.360]  says, it's total fabrication, and you go read about Wolfe, it's like everybody's ever been
[24:15.360 --> 24:21.040]  interviewed by him, says he's a fabricator, that's what he's known for, he's not a journalist,
[24:21.040 --> 24:25.720]  he's a fabricator in my research view.
[24:25.720 --> 24:31.240]  The author of the explosive new Trump book says he can't be sure if parts of it are true.
[24:31.240 --> 24:40.920]  See, why didn't Bannon come out day one and say, oh, this is twisted, I didn't do this?
[24:40.920 --> 24:45.040]  No.
[24:45.040 --> 24:49.320]  That's not what they do.
[24:49.320 --> 24:53.320]  He just sits there and goes, oh, I love Trump, and then sits back and watches his attempt
[24:53.320 --> 24:56.920]  to blow up the White House politically.
[24:56.920 --> 25:02.160]  He lights the fuse, walks off the safe distance, he goes, is it snowing outside?
[25:02.160 --> 25:05.360]  No, it's dandruff.
[25:05.360 --> 25:10.720]  Catch up stains down the front of him, I'm the Liberty Movement, I came with money and
[25:10.720 --> 25:15.320]  took over Breitbart after he died, I'm the kingpin, I'm the god, I'm the Liberty Movement,
[25:15.320 --> 25:19.480]  meanwhile he's behind the scenes leaking everything to the New York Times and the Washington Post.
[25:19.480 --> 25:24.960]  By the way, leaking BS and running around, we now know the FBI, fawning and agreeing
[25:24.960 --> 25:35.280]  with the Russia investigation in a hope to, I guess, sabotage the White House and have
[25:35.280 --> 25:42.080]  his cake and eat it too, to see the sociopaths and psychopaths or weak people that have been
[25:42.080 --> 25:44.200]  abused themselves and they go out and do it to others.
[25:44.200 --> 25:48.320]  He's like, they're owed something, I've had a lot of times, that's really what it is.
[25:48.320 --> 25:51.880]  I think Bannon's kind of one of those, he wants to show everybody he's the big man,
[25:51.880 --> 25:56.600]  he's the tough guy, he's the leader, he's in control, and he's got to overthrow everybody
[25:56.600 --> 26:03.520]  around him so he can feel like he's big, he's number one.
[26:03.520 --> 26:09.640]  That's not the case with Wolfie and Skelter and Clinton.
[26:09.640 --> 26:15.560]  They know exactly what they're doing and they hate everybody around them.
[26:15.560 --> 26:23.600]  And they want to burn our world down so they can act like they're the big boys.
[26:23.600 --> 26:24.600]  And they love it.
[26:24.600 --> 26:31.280]  I mean, it is just sick and how ridiculous power trips are, how horrible they are, how
[26:31.280 --> 26:36.080]  enslaving they are, and you see someone possessed with a power trip.
[26:36.080 --> 26:43.240]  You see someone so into themselves that they'll do anything to serve evil.
[26:43.240 --> 26:49.360]  And notice, they don't ever go make up stuff or do anything in the fiction world because
[26:49.360 --> 26:50.360]  they don't want to do that.
[26:50.360 --> 26:53.280]  Or they call it fiction, but it's really propaganda.
[26:53.280 --> 27:00.080]  Everything with them is deceit because they don't know any better.
[27:00.080 --> 27:06.960]  They're deceivers, they're defilers, they're poisoners.
[27:06.960 --> 27:10.600]  They don't like the light in your eyes.
[27:10.600 --> 27:15.440]  They don't like the soul, they don't like the honor, they don't like the strength, they
[27:15.440 --> 27:17.520]  don't like the will.
[27:17.520 --> 27:22.440]  And they take the fact that we're kind and loving and good and open armed to come into
[27:22.440 --> 27:32.760]  our midst and to feed and twist and hurt people and play folks off against each other.
[27:32.760 --> 27:38.520]  And there are these psychopathic twisted control freaks in every culture, in every society,
[27:38.520 --> 27:43.320]  in every group, in all parts of history, and they always act and behave the same.
[27:43.320 --> 27:46.840]  And they always push and push and push and push thinking they're invincible until the
[27:46.840 --> 27:49.120]  giant awakens and it's too late.
[27:49.120 --> 27:51.960]  And they've studied the history books and they think they have technology and other
[27:51.960 --> 27:56.600]  things that they'll be able to override the human will to survive and the human will to
[27:56.600 --> 28:01.200]  have honor and the human will to be strong and forthright.
[28:01.200 --> 28:07.720]  And they take our nobility that they so hate and crave because they don't have one, one
[28:07.720 --> 28:14.640]  trillionth of the spark that we have that is only one, one trillionth of a fraction of
[28:14.640 --> 28:16.720]  infinity of the mind of God.
[28:16.720 --> 28:19.000]  They are cut off from God.
[28:19.000 --> 28:24.680]  And so they want to ruin and wreck civilization and they are committed to doing it and they
[28:24.680 --> 28:29.920]  are committed to hurting you and your family, poisoning your food and water, watching your
[28:29.920 --> 28:33.960]  children be brain damaged while they strut around and watch and gloat and laugh.
[28:33.960 --> 28:36.000]  None of these top leftist take vaccines.
[28:36.000 --> 28:41.000]  None of them, none of them eat GMO, none of them are into Aspartame.
[28:41.000 --> 28:45.760]  It's for the president to drink and die and it's for us to drink and die or your mother
[28:45.760 --> 28:46.760]  to drink and die.
[28:46.760 --> 28:51.680]  They all just sit back and laugh as they literally have that, they always go, we're falling and
[28:51.680 --> 28:52.680]  we're scum.
[28:52.680 --> 28:55.880]  But when they walk around the shopping mall, they go, at least I'm hurting these people
[28:55.880 --> 28:59.480]  and how can I hurt somebody right now?
[28:59.480 --> 29:02.760]  Water is the single most important thing your body needs.
[29:02.760 --> 29:06.200]  So you want to be sure it's the best for you and your family.
[29:06.200 --> 29:10.320]  Since 2005, thousands have depended on Berkey purified water.
[29:10.320 --> 29:16.240]  The Berkey guy provides the lowest price filtration systems in every size for incredibly delicious
[29:16.240 --> 29:18.880]  water now and in an emergency.
[29:18.880 --> 29:29.160]  Get to goberkey.com or call 877-886-3653, 877-886-3653, goberkey.com.
[29:29.160 --> 29:31.760]  Most people think life insurance pays after you're dead.
[29:31.760 --> 29:32.760]  That's true.
[29:32.760 --> 29:36.440]  But did you know you can have tax free access to your life insurance while you're still
[29:36.440 --> 29:37.760]  alive?
[29:37.760 --> 29:41.360]  You can use the life benefits of your life insurance to grow your money with certainty
[29:41.360 --> 29:47.280]  and guarantees, no stock market risk, no tax risk, and no penalties.
[29:47.280 --> 29:51.120]  Call life benefits if you'd like a free book about how this can be done.
[29:51.120 --> 30:00.440]  Call 702-660-7000, that's 702-660-7000.
[30:00.440 --> 30:04.640]  Please listen carefully because I'm about to point out three things that will save you
[30:04.640 --> 30:10.000]  a lot of money while you get high quality products and fund the Info War, a 360 win.
[30:10.000 --> 30:15.000]  Number one, when you choose auto ship before checkout, we give you 10% off on your order
[30:15.000 --> 30:16.600]  at infowarstore.com.
[30:16.600 --> 30:20.440]  Number two, you're also able to get items that are out of stock when you sign up for
[30:20.440 --> 30:24.520]  auto ship because we hold back a surplus for auto ship customers.
[30:24.520 --> 30:29.760]  Number three, we're giving you free shipping on all orders above $50.
[30:29.760 --> 30:33.840]  Listeners have been requesting this for years because it's so easy to forget to reorder
[30:33.840 --> 30:35.640]  the products that you need each month.
[30:35.640 --> 30:39.280]  Just go to infowarstore.com, select your favorite product or products.
[30:39.280 --> 30:43.360]  Click on auto ship and choose how often you want us to send you another order.
[30:43.360 --> 30:48.660]  As you know, I coined the term 360 win and with the new auto ship feature at infowarslife.com,
[30:48.660 --> 30:50.160]  this is a sure win.
[30:50.160 --> 30:56.040]  10% off on auto ship, win win win at infowarslife.com, free shipping on orders above $50.
[30:56.040 --> 30:59.960]  And all out of stock items are never out of stock when you sign up for auto ship.
[30:59.960 --> 31:06.280]  I want to plow into all of this, but I'm going to spend a few minutes here first, just encouraging
[31:06.280 --> 31:12.680]  listeners to understand that when you buy t-shirts or water filtration systems or books
[31:12.680 --> 31:19.920]  or videos or other material from infowarstore.com, you are funding the revolution.
[31:19.920 --> 31:22.120]  I mean, I cannot say it any clear.
[31:22.120 --> 31:25.760]  And so it is essential that you purchase the products at infowarstore.com.
[31:25.760 --> 31:29.480]  I don't want to thank everybody that has, but we've got the best fluoride-free toothpaste
[31:29.480 --> 31:33.360]  with colloidal silver and with high quality atomic iodine in it.
[31:33.360 --> 31:34.680]  You cannot beat that.
[31:34.680 --> 31:38.440]  Our children and adults, we've got the best mouthwash designed by Dr. Jones.
[31:38.440 --> 31:45.600]  That's my dad, the colloidal silver and iodine as well, infowarslife.com or AAA2533139.
[31:45.600 --> 31:50.040]  And your purchase of the products stands with us, stands with America, stands with Trump,
[31:50.040 --> 31:52.880]  stands against the globalists and their satanic pedophile armies.
[31:52.880 --> 31:56.000]  And that's who they are, and they know we know who they are, and they're coming back
[31:56.000 --> 32:00.480]  against us so we need your support.
[32:00.480 --> 32:06.800]  I'm so excited, the new product at infowarslife.com, in a glass bottle, two-month servings filled
[32:06.800 --> 32:11.600]  to the brim, filled to the absolute top, the real red pill.
[32:11.600 --> 32:17.080]  This is a heart and brain pill, a new tropic that doesn't have any stimulants in it, but
[32:17.080 --> 32:20.040]  boy does it stimulate because it's beyond that.
[32:20.040 --> 32:26.080]  Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients,
[32:26.080 --> 32:32.640]  but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200 for the formulae,
[32:32.640 --> 32:37.720]  and I came up with our own formulae, working with scientists and developers, non-GMO, made
[32:37.720 --> 32:44.360]  right here in America, 120 capsules, and ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglonone to it,
[32:44.360 --> 32:48.800]  which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the
[32:48.800 --> 32:50.520]  hormones in your glands.
[32:50.520 --> 32:53.320]  It is amazing.
[32:53.320 --> 33:03.480]  Good pill, now available at infowarsstore.com, and your purchase fugs the operation.
[33:03.480 --> 33:22.160]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[33:22.160 --> 33:38.920]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live broadcasting worldwide.
[33:38.920 --> 33:41.400]  I intend to open the phones up coming up.
[33:41.400 --> 33:48.640]  In the next segment, the toll-free number to join us is 877-789-2539.
[33:48.640 --> 33:50.920]  I keep forgetting to tell you guys during the breaks, I'm sorry.
[33:50.920 --> 33:52.560]  You put the clock back up there for me.
[33:52.560 --> 33:53.560]  Thank you.
[33:53.560 --> 33:54.560]  That's really helpful.
[33:54.560 --> 33:55.560]  877-789-2539.
[33:55.560 --> 34:01.920]  We're opening the phones up on any subject you want to discuss, but really, I think it's
[34:01.920 --> 34:08.760]  important for everybody to understand that we've got a bunch of clips of the wolf in
[34:08.760 --> 34:12.520]  journalist clothing, which is really the wolf stream media.
[34:12.520 --> 34:13.680]  I mean, that's what they are.
[34:13.680 --> 34:18.400]  They are fake news in sheep's clothing.
[34:18.400 --> 34:20.880]  They are wolves in sheep's clothing.
[34:20.880 --> 34:25.680]  The author of the explosive new Trump book says he can't be sure if parts of it are true,
[34:25.680 --> 34:31.800]  and they, quote, did whatever it took to get the story.
[34:31.800 --> 34:36.600]  Isn't that just sweet as pumpkin pie?
[34:36.600 --> 34:39.240]  And that's what these people are all about, ladies and gentlemen.
[34:39.240 --> 34:42.360]  Tony Blair says the guy's a liar, they didn't say these things.
[34:42.360 --> 34:45.600]  It goes on and on and on.
[34:45.600 --> 34:51.880]  Meanwhile, this is the number one story pretty much in the world.
[34:51.880 --> 34:53.720]  He couldn't even come up with the name himself.
[34:53.720 --> 34:58.920]  He had to lift it from the president, the target of his parasitic behavior.
[34:58.920 --> 35:02.520]  And as one of the crew in there said, you know, we're really just lining this guy's pockets,
[35:02.520 --> 35:03.520]  and I understand that.
[35:03.520 --> 35:05.280]  That's what it is about parasites.
[35:05.280 --> 35:06.640]  They take your energy.
[35:06.640 --> 35:08.680]  They force you to counter them.
[35:08.680 --> 35:13.480]  They force you to smash them flat, and they have no honor, so they don't care.
[35:13.480 --> 35:14.840]  They run off to the bank.
[35:14.840 --> 35:20.680]  This guy is a known charlatan.
[35:20.680 --> 35:26.760]  It's simply insane, just like his son, Brian Skelter, I'm saying a spiritual son, because
[35:26.760 --> 35:30.560]  if you find the two smiling and photos, they're trying to keep all those photos off the internet
[35:30.560 --> 35:31.560]  seriously.
[35:31.560 --> 35:34.200]  Like photos of Hillary smiling, they remove them, because she looks like a great white
[35:34.200 --> 35:38.640]  shark when it's about to attack and breach the surface.
[35:38.640 --> 35:41.920]  And the dead shark eyes.
[35:41.920 --> 35:46.440]  It's all about minions, all about her feeling powerful as someone grovels to her.
[35:46.440 --> 35:56.200]  Oh, yes, oh, oh, you're so powerful, oh, yes, thank you, I am.
[35:56.200 --> 36:00.440]  Not so powerful now, are you, witch?
[36:00.440 --> 36:08.640]  And you'll be known in history as a crook, and Trump will be known as a titan of liberty.
[36:08.640 --> 36:13.080]  Someone that delivered, someone that was honorable, and you'll all try to write the
[36:13.080 --> 36:16.520]  annals that he wasn't.
[36:16.520 --> 36:20.040]  But just like the British history books said, William Wallace was this and that, and a thief
[36:20.040 --> 36:22.760]  and a piece of garbage and a coward.
[36:22.760 --> 36:27.320]  Everybody knows in history now he wasn't a coward, he was an honorable man, because everybody
[36:27.320 --> 36:32.800]  intrinsically knows everything you say is a pile of garbage.
[36:32.800 --> 36:41.640]  You are the lie, the liar, the enemy, the defiler, the disgraceful, the cowardly, the
[36:41.640 --> 36:53.280]  spiritually wicked, the abomination, fallen, twisted, ugly, venomous, dishonorable.
[36:53.280 --> 36:56.520]  These are your names of you and your father.
[36:56.520 --> 37:04.720]  So just remember that, just remember that all of you that seek evil, believing you'll
[37:04.720 --> 37:10.120]  find power, all you will find is disgrace, but you already know that because many of
[37:10.120 --> 37:13.640]  you are inherently evil.
[37:13.640 --> 37:20.640]  You inherently choose that and you are of that, and you like that.
[37:20.640 --> 37:26.240]  I'm speaking to the general public who isn't like that to understand we're dealing with
[37:26.240 --> 37:30.640]  people that want to lie to you and screw you over and hurt you.
[37:30.640 --> 37:34.040]  That's what they get off on.
[37:34.040 --> 37:38.000]  And everybody knows this, everybody understands this in criminology, history's replete with
[37:38.000 --> 37:44.080]  it, and we're looking down the barrel of it now, and they are spiritually pulling their
[37:44.080 --> 37:51.960]  hair out because they know there's somebody now, not just here, but all over the world,
[37:51.960 --> 37:53.240]  like you.
[37:53.240 --> 37:57.840]  They know there's somebody like you who does love God, who does love justice, who wants
[37:57.840 --> 38:01.880]  to be truthful, who wants to be nice, who wants to help people, who doesn't get mad
[38:01.880 --> 38:05.640]  at other people's success.
[38:05.640 --> 38:11.920]  You can have anything you want, just don't take it from me.
[38:11.920 --> 38:23.360]  Let's see, these are more than anything spiritually ugly people.
[38:23.360 --> 38:33.440]  If you think their appearances are ugly, their souls are devoid of anything but a grasping
[38:33.440 --> 38:36.840]  lust to hurt you.
[38:36.840 --> 38:41.240]  And if they could just strangle some innocence out of something, just while they wrap their
[38:41.240 --> 38:47.440]  fingers metaphysically around the child innocence next and squeeze the life out of it, they
[38:47.440 --> 38:56.640]  for a glimpse feel like they've conquered death by pulling something down as they scrabble
[38:56.640 --> 38:58.320]  in their little pits.
[38:58.320 --> 39:06.840]  Now, I'm done preaching, but you have to understand we're dealing with scum of the earth.
[39:06.840 --> 39:10.640]  And I think I've said that enough, but scum of the earth, scum of the earth, scum of the
[39:10.640 --> 39:18.880]  earth, scum of the earth, scum of the earth, scum, losers, trash, filth, I just cannot
[39:18.880 --> 39:25.080]  express to you enough that we have to really not hate these people, but you don't hate
[39:25.080 --> 39:35.040]  a rotting dead carcass of a hog or a horse or a deer over on the side of the highway,
[39:35.040 --> 39:40.400]  but you don't want to run up to it and wallow in it and kiss it and marry it or take it
[39:40.400 --> 39:41.840]  home and put it in the bed with you.
[39:41.840 --> 39:45.480]  You don't take a dead rotting horse with thousands of maggots on it and go stick it
[39:45.480 --> 39:48.680]  in your bed and curl up to it at night and love it and celebrate it.
[39:48.680 --> 39:52.680]  You just stay away from it.
[39:52.680 --> 39:56.600]  But see, we can't stay away because these people run our lives because they crave it
[39:56.600 --> 40:00.880]  and they get in the positions over everybody so they can sit there and rain hell down on
[40:00.880 --> 40:07.880]  us because they're already on the bottom and they're trying to bring the world down, they're
[40:07.880 --> 40:12.360]  trying to burn it down because they don't like you.
[40:12.360 --> 40:18.880]  They don't like God, they don't like justice, they don't like anything decent and wholesome.
[40:18.880 --> 40:23.400]  They drive through these globalists through the countryside and see pretty fields and
[40:23.400 --> 40:28.720]  happy farmhouses and they get angry.
[40:28.720 --> 40:34.960]  They have extreme enmity, but they see some homeless person with big old jaundice eyes,
[40:34.960 --> 40:38.720]  bloodshot stumbling around with diarrhea running down their leg and they kind of get a little
[40:38.720 --> 40:39.720]  happy.
[40:39.720 --> 40:40.720]  I've seen it.
[40:40.720 --> 40:44.600]  They'll kind of look at them and I've noticed that about leftists and you're like, oh my
[40:44.600 --> 40:49.200]  God, they are literal psychic vampires and that's why everywhere they're in control.
[40:49.200 --> 40:54.120]  There's just feces all over the ground and people starving and lying around and drug
[40:54.120 --> 40:59.640]  needles everywhere while they drive around in their $150,000 cars and just enjoy it.
[40:59.640 --> 41:07.520]  Oh yes, the ugliness, like a lord looking down from his castle at the starving villagers
[41:07.520 --> 41:11.160]  that are like a foot shorter than him and his family because for generations they've
[41:11.160 --> 41:16.120]  been stunting them and keeping them down and they just look over the castle wall and just
[41:16.120 --> 41:18.240]  say, ah, it's such a pleasure.
[41:18.240 --> 41:24.200]  It's so fun to hold America underwater, it's so much fun to have us with the highest prohibitory
[41:24.200 --> 41:27.920]  taxes in the world to keep jobs out of the country, it's so much fun to turn men and
[41:27.920 --> 41:31.400]  women against each other and black against white and old against young, it's so much
[41:31.400 --> 41:34.760]  fun to twist everything and deceive and corrupt.
[41:34.760 --> 41:39.560]  Ah, it's so good when you're in the darkness and they don't know and you can just play
[41:39.560 --> 41:44.400]  with them like they're little toys and you can break arms off and break legs off and
[41:44.400 --> 41:50.080]  set the toys on fire and do whatever you want to them and just giggle and laugh and have
[41:50.080 --> 41:57.640]  fun because that's what you do because you are the most hideous, twisted, defiling, lying,
[41:57.640 --> 42:00.920]  little vipers the earth has ever seen.
[42:00.920 --> 42:04.320]  Okay, don't you they are.
[42:04.320 --> 42:11.880]  Again, I could talk for a thousand days, you cannot describe their commitment to evil,
[42:11.880 --> 42:23.680]  their commitment, their soul lust, their love, their desire is to hurt you, period.
[42:23.680 --> 42:31.320]  They know and they think it's funny, but they don't want you to know, they like the sick
[42:31.320 --> 42:38.640]  joke of telling you they are betrayed culture and society, they're in charge and they are
[42:38.640 --> 42:43.080]  going to tell you how to and you're going to come to them as their priest, their guru,
[42:43.080 --> 42:48.600]  their shaman and they're going to look down on you as a pile of crap and they're going
[42:48.600 --> 42:54.000]  to try to do whatever they can to turn you into a confused, freaked out, fallen, failed
[42:54.000 --> 42:59.160]  person like them, but you're not.
[42:59.160 --> 43:03.600]  The elusive Matt Drudge has hinted there may be a shakeup at Breitbart News.
[43:03.600 --> 43:07.480]  He tweeted a photo of Andrew Breitbart with the accompanying text.
[43:07.480 --> 43:12.600]  The terrific Larry Salove and Susie Breitbart will take Breitbart into the fresh future.
[43:12.600 --> 43:17.600]  Has it really been 10 years since Andrew told me on Santa Monica Pier he was going to do
[43:17.600 --> 43:18.600]  it?
[43:18.600 --> 43:22.600]  His first hire, Alex Marlowe, became one of the best news editors in the world.
[43:22.600 --> 43:27.320]  The Washington Times reports that Salove was Andrew Breitbart's longtime friend and business
[43:27.320 --> 43:33.080]  partner who became the president and CEO of Breitbart News after Andrew's sudden and tragic
[43:33.080 --> 43:34.520]  death in 2012.
[43:34.520 --> 43:39.080]  Although he was brought on initially to serve a more advisory function, Bannon's influence
[43:39.080 --> 43:41.800]  has steered the site in recent years.
[43:41.800 --> 43:46.440]  After the president's verbal dressing down of his former staffer, it seems unlikely Steve
[43:46.440 --> 43:48.720]  Bannon will stay at the helm of Breitbart.
[43:48.720 --> 43:53.440]  Drudge's tweet suggests a decision has all but been made to oust Bannon, and those who
[43:53.440 --> 43:56.720]  helped create Breitbart are taking back the reins.
[43:56.720 --> 43:58.720]  Leanne McAdoo, Infowars.com.
[43:58.720 --> 44:03.200]  Matt and Ohio, you're on the air, another Matt, go ahead.
[44:03.200 --> 44:08.400]  Hey, listen, I just wanted to say real quick, I'm a longtime listener of Infowars, and I

[44:26.120 --> 44:31.240]  My favorite new one is the don't tread on me, but said it says won't tread on me, and
[44:31.240 --> 44:36.000]  it's a big day glow snake, Gadsden snake, and then it's got the American flag, Infowars.com
[44:36.000 --> 44:37.000]  on the right arm.
[44:37.000 --> 44:42.480]  I mean, that's a great way just to meet like-minded people and spread the word and also exercise
[44:42.480 --> 44:43.480]  free speech.
[44:43.480 --> 44:49.040]  The newest one is trigger warning t-shirt, trigger warning t-shirt, which is the symbol
[44:49.040 --> 44:53.520]  of a trigger with a yield sign in the Infowars.com on the back.
[44:53.520 --> 45:01.280]  That is the new shirt of the month available exclusively at Infowars.com.

[46:56.320 --> 47:22.320]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[47:22.320 --> 47:29.320]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[47:29.320 --> 47:34.440]  Look at the most popular stories on Infowars.com from the last few days.
[47:34.440 --> 47:37.840]  Colorado lawmakers resist sessions war on marijuana.
[47:37.840 --> 47:40.520]  What a stupid dumb thing by sessions.
[47:40.520 --> 47:47.400]  Court upholds 135,000 K fine for bakers that refuse to bake a gay cake.
[47:47.400 --> 47:50.480]  Green Day singer tells his Trump-supporting fans to f off.
[47:50.480 --> 47:54.640]  Germany to censor media and upcoming Nazi-style purges have openly announced it.
[47:54.640 --> 48:00.040]  And Chelsea Clinton sends a Happy New Year's Tweet to the Church of Satan.
[48:00.040 --> 48:04.560]  What a little mix of bizarreness.
[48:04.560 --> 48:08.440]  But again, you get an idea of where they're coming from.
[48:08.440 --> 48:18.720]  Put as many peaceful, nonviolent, even legal marijuana smokers in jail as you can while
[48:18.720 --> 48:24.880]  the Clinton crime family has been caught smuggling children out of Haiti by the thousands.
[48:24.880 --> 48:25.960]  Associated Press.
[48:25.960 --> 48:29.600]  One big investigative report over two years came out what, six months ago?
[48:29.600 --> 48:31.840]  No coverage of it anywhere.
[48:31.840 --> 48:35.160]  I can't believe AP even put it out, but see what happens is people find this is going
[48:35.160 --> 48:38.560]  on, they document it, and they go, listen, everybody's going to revolt that it didn't
[48:38.560 --> 48:39.560]  pure criminals.
[48:39.560 --> 48:43.160]  If we don't at least put this out, and then we can kind of act like, you know, when more
[48:43.160 --> 48:45.200]  comes out later that we did something.
[48:45.200 --> 48:46.200]  It's just incredible.
[48:46.200 --> 48:48.920]  And a lot of people go, look, these are really evil people.
[48:48.920 --> 48:49.920]  We get it, Alex.
[48:49.920 --> 48:50.920]  We're not going up against them.
[48:50.920 --> 48:54.080]  They're going to get you when they want to get you.
[48:54.080 --> 49:01.240]  If you don't fight them now, I mean, if somebody's coming after me, let's go.
[49:01.240 --> 49:02.480]  I'm going to get them.
[49:02.480 --> 49:03.480]  How about that?
[49:03.480 --> 49:09.960]  I mean, they're a bunch of hunchback devil worshipers for heaven's sakes.
[49:09.960 --> 49:15.200]  Who's going to protect the children if we don't do it?
[49:15.200 --> 49:24.120]  I just am letting myself realize how they are truly as bad as we've always said, they're
[49:24.120 --> 49:25.120]  even worse.
[49:25.120 --> 49:27.840]  It's like, oh my God, how much worse?
[49:27.840 --> 49:28.840]  It's incredible.
[49:28.840 --> 49:30.720]  And we're living right beside these people.
[49:30.720 --> 49:32.920]  They're all around us.
[49:32.920 --> 49:37.400]  It's a very small minority, but man, they have recruited all of these weak-minded people
[49:37.400 --> 49:41.520]  and all these people, all these narcissists and folks, they have recruited them and they
[49:41.520 --> 49:47.680]  have got legions of these idiots who are destroying their own humanity and their own future so
[49:47.680 --> 49:52.720]  they can be on a red carpet with a bunch of skexies.
[49:52.720 --> 49:57.800]  You couldn't pay me all, I mean, I just, oh, I've gone from not caring about Hollywood
[49:57.800 --> 50:00.640]  to all just absolutely loathing it.
[50:00.640 --> 50:04.880]  And the good news is people are beginning to loathe it as well everywhere and it's good
[50:04.880 --> 50:06.680]  and so I'm so happy.
[50:06.680 --> 50:12.520]  But it makes the enemy fight even harder and it makes them pull out all the stops and really
[50:12.520 --> 50:15.320]  show us who they are trying to get us back under their control.
[50:15.320 --> 50:19.320]  And then I think about the poor people that are, I mean, Nico Acosta made this point to
[50:19.320 --> 50:22.880]  me and pulled a video on it days ago and I just can't even look at this guy to play
[50:22.880 --> 50:27.920]  the videos, but he's got billions of views.
[50:27.920 --> 50:33.320]  Logan Paul video, YouTube users act fast to re-upload suicide forest video despite it
[50:33.320 --> 50:37.720]  being taken down and then YouTube doesn't take it down after it had tens of millions
[50:37.720 --> 50:38.720]  of views.
[50:38.720 --> 50:43.640]  He took it down and then does a sorry video and it's all a big joke and because it's nasty
[50:43.640 --> 50:51.680]  and it's not masculine and it's done in a little demonic, gremlin-like way, they leave
[50:51.680 --> 50:53.000]  it up.
[50:53.000 --> 51:04.440]  But then we show army troops saving children from a burning van and they take it down because
[51:04.440 --> 51:08.280]  they don't want you to see army troops saving kids out of a van.
[51:08.280 --> 51:09.280]  That's YouTube.
[51:09.280 --> 51:16.480]  I mean, it's a true culture of little weak twisted people sitting there.
[51:16.480 --> 51:20.280]  We've got them on video going, my main mission is to stop Alex Jones and people like him
[51:20.280 --> 51:23.360]  and all we do is de-list it so nobody can see it.
[51:23.360 --> 51:27.120]  And then we have it in Congress and everywhere saying, shut us down.
[51:27.120 --> 51:28.120]  Why?
[51:28.120 --> 51:31.040]  Because you can see what they are.
[51:31.040 --> 51:35.520]  They go hang out in Japan, it turns out, for weeks, waiting for somebody to go to this
[51:35.520 --> 51:40.520]  famous forest where it's kind of like a Romeo and Juliet story where a young girl killed
[51:40.520 --> 51:45.680]  herself for love and then hundreds have gone there and hung themselves, killed themselves
[51:45.680 --> 51:50.760]  and so he goes and makes a big joke and makes fun of the dead body, disgracing some poor
[51:50.760 --> 51:57.560]  soul who took their own life and because it's so dishonorable, so twisted, so weak, so pathetic,
[51:57.560 --> 52:06.880]  so poisonous, so heartless, so soulless that if they can get young people to get off on
[52:06.880 --> 52:11.760]  somebody's misery and they're rotting dead body and make fun of it and then make money
[52:11.760 --> 52:19.360]  off of it and do it while you're wearing a Yoda hat, all of it perfectly done.
[52:19.360 --> 52:20.360]  This is a sigh up, folks.
[52:20.360 --> 52:22.640]  This is all staged.
[52:22.640 --> 52:27.400]  To turn wisdom on its head, it's all archetypal.
[52:27.400 --> 52:29.480]  You think Yoda would go make fun of some dead body?
[52:29.480 --> 52:32.400]  Again, that archetype, this is what it's all about.
[52:32.400 --> 52:38.320]  It's all about defiling so that you'll defile yourself so you'll be dishonorable so they
[52:38.320 --> 52:47.040]  have bigger armies of sociopathic zombies to carry out their operations.
[52:47.040 --> 52:50.800]  I've got all these video clips and loaded phone lines and we've got Zach, I don't know
[52:50.800 --> 52:53.840]  if he's going to give us identity out today, his name is Zach, formerly with Army Special
[52:53.840 --> 52:58.640]  Operations and Intelligence in pretty sensitive areas, giving us a lot of key information
[52:58.640 --> 53:01.640]  that's not classified about the globalist and their next moves.
[53:01.640 --> 53:04.920]  Just as important as anything you see from QAnon or anything and I'm not lessening that.
[53:04.920 --> 53:05.920]  This is real.
[53:05.920 --> 53:06.920]  This is valid.
[53:06.920 --> 53:07.920]  We can guarantee it.
[53:07.920 --> 53:11.220]  It'll pass from Vegas to you name it so that's coming up.
[53:11.220 --> 53:14.180]  Millie Weber's coming in her bottom of the hour, but Jeff in Vancouver Island and many
[53:14.180 --> 53:16.440]  others were going to your called during just a few minutes.
[53:16.440 --> 53:17.440]  You know the drill.
[53:17.440 --> 53:19.360]  Gotta thank you for your support.
[53:19.360 --> 53:20.360]  You're the reason we're here.
[53:20.360 --> 53:25.240]  If you go buy products, t-shirts, books, films, water filters, you name it.
[53:25.240 --> 53:28.400]  Head in for Warshore.com.
[53:28.400 --> 53:31.840]  You support the tip of the spear and believe me, I actually have asked me to get the tip
[53:31.840 --> 53:32.840]  of the spear.
[53:32.840 --> 53:35.200]  I've tried to be the tip of the spear, not knowing God but actually do it.
[53:35.200 --> 53:38.880]  do it. I mean I just meant God give me whatever strength I can to fight these people and make
[53:38.880 --> 53:44.120]  me strong because I'm weak and please God my hands and please help me because I'm under
[53:44.120 --> 53:48.200]  attack, my family's under attack and I'm not one and I ask for it but let me tell you something.
[53:48.200 --> 53:53.640]  We are the tip of the spear. We are the enemy's number one threat other than Trump because
[53:53.640 --> 53:57.480]  we're there pointing out who they are and that they're horrible demons and we're not
[53:57.480 --> 54:02.320]  afraid of them because we're afraid of giving in to them. We're afraid of turning loose
[54:02.320 --> 54:10.240]  our will to them. Out of fear I have no fear, understand? So I need you to commit to go
[54:10.240 --> 54:15.720]  to M4warstore.com and it just enrages them and buy the products you need. Just shop with
[54:15.720 --> 54:21.920]  the good guys, it'll change the world. 50% off almost all of our best selling items
[54:21.920 --> 54:27.040]  except for stuff like, oops, I didn't do that on purpose, it's 67% off the Coil Silver.
[54:27.040 --> 54:30.920]  We had to pull that because it's basically sold out. So let's come back to regular prices
[54:30.920 --> 54:36.720]  to look great deal on Silver Bullet. We've got the Super Blue fluoride free toothpaste
[54:36.720 --> 54:42.600]  that is again 4 to 5 of Coil Silver and iodine for adults and children and the Super Blue
[54:42.600 --> 54:46.960]  mouthwash as well, both fortified. It's amazing for your gums, you name it, there's nothing
[54:46.960 --> 54:51.680]  else out there like it and of course it's a best seller. M4warstore.com, read the thousands
[54:51.680 --> 55:04.880]  of 5-star reviews at M4warslife.com or 888-253-3139. 50% off all Super Blue products, 50% off
[55:04.880 --> 55:16.560]  all of them, M4warslife.com, M4warsstore.com or 888-253-3139. 50% off and then other
[55:16.560 --> 55:22.360]  stuff's even more. But again, a lot of it is selling out. The Super Blue is very, very
[55:22.360 --> 55:27.280]  close to being sold out and so I'm going to be back in for a month and a half or so,
[55:27.280 --> 55:32.120]  they say until the end of February. So I'm going to have to after the weekend, that stockpile
[55:32.120 --> 55:37.120]  has been depleted and it's a big deal to run a big run of it at the big factory. Again,
[55:37.120 --> 55:41.240]  it's produced by the company that produces some of the top names in organic fluoride
[55:41.240 --> 55:47.040]  free toothpaste. But some of them are politically correct so that we've gotten word that we're
[55:47.040 --> 55:51.240]  not supposed to say it, even though we can. But it's fine. The point is it's high quality.
[55:51.240 --> 56:01.680]  M4warslife.com, M4warsstore.com or 888-253-3139. Super Blue, we're very, very proud of it.
[56:01.680 --> 56:06.520]  As I'm my dad, oral surgeon, doctor, dentist, implant surgeon back when he first taught it
[56:06.520 --> 56:11.520]  when it first came out at Baylor Medical. He's a smart guy and it's great toothpaste
[56:11.520 --> 56:20.560]  designed by a dentist for his family. So M4warsstore.com, M4warslife.com or 888-253-3139. And whether
[56:20.560 --> 56:24.560]  it's the real red pill, I'll find out about that, which is the foundation for everything
[56:24.560 --> 56:30.520]  or whether it is alpha power that is amazing or whether it's super mill vitality. Some
[56:30.520 --> 56:33.960]  people like super mill vitality better. Some people like alpha power better. We've all
[56:33.960 --> 56:37.200]  tried it here in the office. Some people like Anthroplex better. Some people like alpha
[56:37.200 --> 56:40.560]  power better. They're different formulas. They're different for different people. But
[56:40.560 --> 56:47.200]  alpha power is very potent, very strong, stamina, libido, energy, read the refuse. It is amazing.
[56:47.200 --> 56:52.960]  A 50% off for mill vitality. It's all about to end. It has to end because a bunch of this
[56:52.960 --> 56:58.440]  is again, selling out and that's how it is year end. And so it could be much just like,
[56:58.440 --> 57:02.360]  I told you Michael's the ex was selling out. And so that 50% off is now gone and it's
[57:02.360 --> 57:05.840]  about to sell out. I mean, it's going to be sold out probably for months because it's
[57:05.840 --> 57:11.400]  so hard to have California standards and which is basically impossible for multi-ingredient
[57:11.400 --> 57:17.080]  compounds. So it's just batch after batch fails. Other people just slap the sticker
[57:17.080 --> 57:22.760]  on there. I mean, you understand a piece of lettuce has more lead in it than can be in
[57:22.760 --> 57:27.600]  a whole bottle of something according to California standards. And then they'll test
[57:27.600 --> 57:31.120]  everything and hope they catch something even though everybody else can't pass it basically
[57:31.120 --> 57:35.800]  and then go, Oh, look, he's a devil. He's murdering you. This is how this stuff works,
[57:35.800 --> 57:39.080]  ladies and gentlemen, when it's some of the highest quality, cleanest stuff out there.
[57:39.080 --> 57:43.400]  infowarstore.com or triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine. We'll be right
[57:43.400 --> 57:51.480]  back. Please spread the live video links. I am very proud to announce the introduction
[57:51.480 --> 57:58.440]  of the highest quality info wars biome defense probiotic. We wanted to come out with the

[59:52.920 --> 01:00:08.720]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show. Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God. It's Alex
[01:00:08.720 --> 01:00:37.720]  Jones. There's no such thing as the devil's helpers. There's only slaves. There's only
[01:00:37.720 --> 01:00:51.040]  cattle. It always is destroyed. Always is betrayed. And that's what betrayal is. Betrayal
[01:00:51.040 --> 01:00:56.600]  is the essence of evil. We should learn to recognize it and know it for what it is. That's
[01:00:56.600 --> 01:01:00.960]  why they always accuse us that are trying to be good and trying to be honorable and who
[01:01:00.960 --> 01:01:07.320]  have consciences and who bust our butts to try to be the best we can. That we are frauds,
[01:01:07.320 --> 01:01:13.800]  that we are fakes, that face in the crowd moment, that they're always looking for to
[01:01:13.800 --> 01:01:19.560]  try to bring down Trump or myself or Matt Drudge or anybody else when they are the ones
[01:01:19.560 --> 01:01:32.480]  that have the histories. I've gotten a little bit philosophical in the last hour because
[01:01:32.480 --> 01:01:37.960]  it's desperately important that people really understand. I know most of you know this better
[01:01:37.960 --> 01:01:48.840]  than I, but we're really dealing with wholesale evil here. It's committed to hurting all of
[01:01:48.840 --> 01:01:56.320]  us and we just can't sit there and try to keep out of its way and be cowards. We've
[01:01:56.320 --> 01:02:03.240]  got to take it head on and we've got to take it down. And again, I don't say this to brag.
[01:02:03.240 --> 01:02:10.440]  I say it because we're under attack because the spirit of infulgars. It's not just my
[01:02:10.440 --> 01:02:16.160]  spirit, it's your spirit. It's our spirits together with God tying us together. Our
[01:02:16.160 --> 01:02:25.120]  spirit is one of victory. It's one of commitment. It's one of honor. It's one of delivering.
[01:02:25.120 --> 01:02:33.480]  Just want to stretch it and they know that and they know we're never going to fold. They
[01:02:33.480 --> 01:02:38.960]  know it no matter how much poison they put in the water and the food and how much cultural
[01:02:38.960 --> 01:02:45.440]  crap they shoveled with us. We're never giving up and they know it and we're always going
[01:02:45.440 --> 01:02:52.600]  to be so much stronger than them and they know that too and they hate it. So you remember
[01:02:52.600 --> 01:02:57.680]  that and don't ever feel bad about yourself when you know you love God. Don't ever let
[01:02:57.680 --> 01:03:03.280]  the enemy make you depressed and keep you down and tell you you're crap. They're the
[01:03:03.280 --> 01:03:10.680]  crap and we don't revel in how they're failed and fallen. We don't want to be around them.
[01:03:10.680 --> 01:03:17.440]  We want them to go away. Get out of our way. We are the trailblazers. We are the striving
[01:03:17.440 --> 01:03:25.520]  entrepreneurs. We are the builders. That's why the Bible says get behind me Satan. Christ
[01:03:25.520 --> 01:03:32.640]  says get behind me Satan. Get out of my way. The devil doesn't build anything. He follows
[01:03:32.640 --> 01:03:40.600]  life around trying to screw it over. Feeding off of it while he hates it. And I just think
[01:03:40.600 --> 01:03:50.200]  we should all pray to God to help us be strong and in Christ's name say get behind me Satan.
[01:03:50.200 --> 01:03:57.360]  Get behind me Satan. Get behind me Satan. Get behind me Satan. Get behind me Satan. The
[01:03:57.360 --> 01:04:03.440]  name of Jesus Christ. Get behind me Satan. Get behind me Brian Stelter. Get behind me
[01:04:03.440 --> 01:04:09.080]  Michael Wolfe. Get behind me Hillary Clinton. Get out of our way in the name of Jesus Christ
[01:04:09.080 --> 01:04:14.360]  of Nazareth. You know that name. You hate that name because that name is the truth and
[01:04:14.360 --> 01:04:24.000]  is power. Not these fake churches but Christ and Christ's spirit has broken you forever.
[01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:33.720]  You are fallen and feel the strength of Christ. I know you can feel it. It's a spirit. The
[01:04:33.720 --> 01:04:42.240]  death has been conquered. Bye. It's a spirit that when you feel it come into your presence.
[01:04:42.240 --> 01:04:48.480]  It's awesome and it makes you want to cry because you're naked and you're a sinner and
[01:04:48.480 --> 01:05:01.840]  you're in the presence of the God who created all that is and all that will ever be.

[01:06:23.560 --> 01:06:37.280]  I authorized zero access to the White House. Actually turned you down many times. Said
[01:06:37.280 --> 01:06:41.200]  he never spoke to you for the book. It's full of lies, misrepresentations, and sources
[01:06:41.200 --> 01:06:45.760]  that don't exist. So as good a place to start as any. Did you talk to the president? What
[01:06:45.760 --> 01:06:50.960]  was I doing there if he didn't want me to be there? Well, let me ask you, did you talk
[01:06:50.960 --> 01:06:56.480]  to the president? Did you interview him for this book? I absolutely spoke to the president
[01:06:56.480 --> 01:07:01.480]  whether he realized it was an interview or not. I don't know, but it certainly was not
[01:07:01.480 --> 01:07:08.560]  off the record. I am certainly in absolutely in every way comfortable with everything I've
[01:07:08.560 --> 01:07:12.000]  reported in this book. Would you release any of those recordings since your credibility
[01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:18.800]  is being questioned? My credibility is being questioned by a man who has less credibility
[01:07:18.800 --> 01:07:23.600]  than perhaps anyone who has ever walked on earth at this point. Before you stand by everything
[01:07:23.600 --> 01:07:28.000]  in the book, nothing made up. Absolutely everything in the book. Your former editor at Vanity
[01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:31.080]  Fairgrain Carter said he wasn't surprised you'd written this explosive book. He was
[01:07:31.080 --> 01:07:37.880]  surprised they let you in the door at the White House. Are you surprised? You know,
[01:07:37.880 --> 01:07:44.640]  no, I'm a nice guy. I go in. Did you flatter your way in? I certainly said what was ever
[01:07:44.640 --> 01:07:52.240]  necessary to get this story. Listen, he just loves being dishonest. He just relishes evil.
[01:07:52.240 --> 01:07:59.400]  He just feels so good to run around and do bad things. And then just the lies that President
[01:07:59.400 --> 01:08:10.360]  Trump is the most dishonest, discredited person in history doing 95% of what he said he'd
[01:08:10.360 --> 01:08:14.680]  do, at least getting it done or trying to get it done. And then he says he's changed his
[01:08:14.680 --> 01:08:17.760]  mind on Afghanistan. I think that's wrong. He's not doing the stuff he said he'd do
[01:08:17.760 --> 01:08:21.080]  on vaccines. That's wrong. He needs to move forward and he is starting to move forward
[01:08:21.080 --> 01:08:24.240]  to get things cleared up for assigns. That's happening with the grand juries and all that
[01:08:24.240 --> 01:08:28.480]  being dismissed. And so yeah, but he's okay. I guess he's starting to live there. Okay.
[01:08:28.480 --> 01:08:41.120]  He's done some other stuff, but I mean, who delivered on their promises like this? George
[01:08:41.120 --> 01:08:45.600]  Washington. Once Thomas Jefferson got in, he wasn't so much as a libertarian as he was
[01:08:45.600 --> 01:08:49.560]  before. He was still a pretty good guy, but he flip flopped on like 80%. So I can't say
[01:08:49.560 --> 01:08:53.560]  Jefferson even though he was a really smart guy. A lot of his writings influenced me.
[01:08:53.560 --> 01:09:00.680]  I mean, who did what they said they do like this? Abraham Lincoln was an occultist and
[01:09:00.680 --> 01:09:07.280]  a weirdo, had all sorts of health problems and drank mercury seltzers every morning just
[01:09:07.280 --> 01:09:12.400]  so he could stop the disease he had of his bones growing over his joints and his nerves.
[01:09:12.400 --> 01:09:17.920]  I forget the disease. I was reading a book about it a few years ago. Very interesting.
[01:09:17.920 --> 01:09:21.600]  Hitler did what he said he'd do. You know, a lot of times evil actually do it. It says,
[01:09:21.600 --> 01:09:26.720]  what are the promises? Are they good? And does it mean follow through on? And the answer
[01:09:26.720 --> 01:09:32.760]  is yes. The answer is yes. Who else has been following through on their promises? Vladimir
[01:09:32.760 --> 01:09:38.120]  Putin. From what he does politically, he's very honorable. He'll probably have that.
[01:09:38.120 --> 01:09:43.520]  Oh, he's a Russian agent. No, I'm an agent of the truth. Vladimir Putin is the only
[01:09:43.520 --> 01:09:51.560]  other modern statesman that delivers on what he says he'll do. And now it's back in vogue
[01:09:51.560 --> 01:09:58.360]  because of people like Nigel Farage and Ron Paul and Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump.
[01:09:58.360 --> 01:10:06.320]  I'm going to go to your phone calls now. I'm going to go to Jeff in Vancouver and Brendan
[01:10:06.320 --> 01:10:12.760]  and George and Greg and Luke and Sam and Carlos and John and Dan and Steve and Marcos and
[01:10:12.760 --> 01:10:16.200]  Debbie and Miles and many others that are joining us. And we got Millie popping in with
[01:10:16.200 --> 01:10:21.720]  the report she shot that's very interesting. Looking at, you know, who Democrats would
[01:10:21.720 --> 01:10:25.040]  support for another run. It's interesting to get into their heads and see what their
[01:10:25.040 --> 01:10:30.520]  body politics thinking. That's why they're big man on the streets that are coming up
[01:10:30.520 --> 01:10:37.840]  very, very soon. They're going to be very informative. Let's go ahead and go to Jeff
[01:10:37.840 --> 01:10:42.240]  in Vancouver Island. What a beautiful place. Go ahead, Jeff, you're on the air.
[01:10:42.240 --> 01:10:49.040]  Hey, Alex, thanks. Man, you are right on target today. I just, just my blood's boiling
[01:10:49.040 --> 01:10:55.400]  with you, brother. And, you know, a couple things, you know, we are, we're in, we're
[01:10:55.400 --> 01:11:00.200]  all in a battle. This globe is in a battle right now. We're in the valley of decision.
[01:11:00.200 --> 01:11:06.320]  And you know, a thought came to me like there's this unseen hand that keeps attacking everything
[01:11:06.320 --> 01:11:11.920]  and tearing down everything. But, you know, the Bible is clear that that unseen hand is
[01:11:11.920 --> 01:11:18.880]  moved from one source. And if all the sycophants would gather around their leader, you would
[01:11:18.880 --> 01:11:24.880]  find that leader to be what the Bible says literally, not a metaphor, a fallen angel.
[01:11:24.880 --> 01:11:29.680]  I've experienced, I've seen it. The Bible calls it the mystery of evil. It's a program,
[01:11:29.680 --> 01:11:35.880]  a spirit. It's working. They are in concert. Right. And it's clear. It's simple Bible
[01:11:35.880 --> 01:11:43.400]  that this being rejected God because he wanted to be God. And that's the, that's the thing
[01:11:43.400 --> 01:11:47.920]  he sells to all these people that have a hole in their heart that are looking for God.
[01:11:47.920 --> 01:11:52.520]  And notice Elon Musk says that he goes, these are very empty, dangerous, anti-human people
[01:11:52.520 --> 01:11:57.120]  that are already worshiping an AI God that's going to make them God. That, that, that is
[01:11:57.120 --> 01:11:58.120]  revelation.
[01:11:58.120 --> 01:12:02.520]  Exactly. That's, that's, that's their plan. And the farther down the rabbit hole, that's
[01:12:02.520 --> 01:12:05.840]  why they get this little buzz of life, the farther down the rabbit hole, because they
[01:12:05.840 --> 01:12:10.680]  think they're getting closer, but they're getting dragged down to this place called
[01:12:10.680 --> 01:12:11.680]  hell.
[01:12:11.680 --> 01:12:15.680]  Exactly. And that's how the universe works. You don't betray and screw people over and
[01:12:15.680 --> 01:12:22.480]  ever in the end get delivered. It's, it's, it's a metaphysical rule of common sense and
[01:12:22.480 --> 01:12:27.840]  the universe and science that they are delusional. But look, when you look at how narcissistic
[01:12:27.840 --> 01:12:33.640]  and on power trips they are, it's like a false program. Like you can see they're totally
[01:12:33.640 --> 01:12:37.880]  weak and pathetic and stupid, but they think they're powerful and smart.
[01:12:37.880 --> 01:12:42.360]  Yeah. And the fruit of it is so clear to people that know God, that we could see that they're
[01:12:42.360 --> 01:12:47.440]  on the wrong path. So, so that's my one point. I just want to finish with this point. The
[01:12:47.440 --> 01:12:53.400]  Bible also says very clearly that Jesus Christ defeated our enemy when he gave his life for
[01:12:53.400 --> 01:12:59.040]  mankind and injected love of the love of God back into the world. And as much as these
[01:12:59.040 --> 01:13:03.680]  people make my blood boil, I know in my heart of hearts that Christ died for every single
[01:13:03.680 --> 01:13:07.960]  one of them. And that's the one thing that's going to turn some of these people in the
[01:13:07.960 --> 01:13:14.440]  valley is that Christ already has paid for their sins. And on the judgment day, when
[01:13:14.440 --> 01:13:19.520]  everybody is looking the God of the universe in the eye, they're going to see that their
[01:13:19.520 --> 01:13:24.520]  debt was paid. They had full life ahead of them and they turned it away for their own
[01:13:24.520 --> 01:13:30.120]  selfishness. And here's the thing. A lot of these evil people know that.
[01:13:30.120 --> 01:13:34.040]  And they're, those people can't be reached, but it's the people that can be reached that
[01:13:34.040 --> 01:13:36.520]  we want to say you're going over the cliff.
[01:13:36.520 --> 01:13:40.320]  No, you're absolutely right because you know what the ultimate sin is. It's, it's refusing
[01:13:40.320 --> 01:13:44.520]  the Holy Spirit, having God actually reach out and show you and you go, I don't want
[01:13:44.520 --> 01:13:49.240]  you. God bless you. I appreciate your call, Jeff. It's unbelievable. Let's jam in one
[01:13:49.240 --> 01:13:55.120]  more call here. Let's go ahead and talk to Carlos calls in all the time, but I'm going
[01:13:55.120 --> 01:14:00.840]  to go to Carlos. So here we go. Go ahead, Carlos and Montreal.
[01:14:00.840 --> 01:14:06.240]  Thank you, Alex. Just wanted to follow up on before talking to you about your fantastic
[01:14:06.240 --> 01:14:13.840]  iodine product. I'd like to just mention that when China says that it will reduce its taxes
[01:14:13.840 --> 01:14:21.120]  to zero to encourage companies to remain in China, in effect, they're failing because
[01:14:21.120 --> 01:14:26.200]  the American companies that have any, any wisdom in this will take them tax money that
[01:14:26.200 --> 01:14:31.400]  they save and reinvested in the United States where they will have a population that has
[01:14:31.400 --> 01:14:38.720]  more disposable income because of the reduced taxes in America. And that's their problem.
[01:14:38.720 --> 01:14:45.680]  If they don't do that in China, and they just maintain the tax level where there is now,
[01:14:45.680 --> 01:14:50.400]  of course, American companies will come back, but then their Chinese don't have the purchasing
[01:14:50.400 --> 01:14:55.680]  power to compete with Americans. Well, exactly. Look, it's state run government,
[01:14:55.680 --> 01:15:01.480]  state run media, and Trump goes, okay, we'll lower our taxes to your level 15%. And then
[01:15:01.480 --> 01:15:05.520]  they go, oh, now it's zero, but you got to invest directly with the, they're saying that
[01:15:05.520 --> 01:15:10.320]  these worldwide companies, many of the US companies have to become state run. And you're
[01:15:10.320 --> 01:15:12.880]  reading it right there in the New York Times, like it's a wonderful thing. They're like,
[01:15:12.880 --> 01:15:18.200]  oh, go stay in China, everybody. I mean, they're literally agents of this evil power that isn't
[01:15:18.200 --> 01:15:26.760]  even communist. It's just this vampiric system. It's incredible. I mean, on its face, the
[01:15:26.760 --> 01:15:31.120]  left is allied with the most radical forms of Islam that oppress women. They're allied
[01:15:31.120 --> 01:15:38.320]  with communism. They're allied with it all. What do you want to say about the eye on brother?
[01:15:38.320 --> 01:15:43.920]  Are you gone, Carlos? I think Carlos is gone. I was thinking about holding him over. We'll
[01:15:43.920 --> 01:15:49.520]  be right back with more phone calls straight ahead. I can't, I shouldn't look at Brian
[01:15:49.520 --> 01:16:15.520]  Stelz just looking at that photo earlier, really, really, really triggered me.
[01:16:15.520 --> 01:16:32.560]  Thank you.

[01:17:06.240 --> 01:17:11.240]  Loss of energy, blood sugar, spikes and drops, poor circulation and irregular heartbeat are

[01:17:59.240 --> 01:18:04.240]  Introducing Floralife, the new probiotic line developed exclusively by Infowars Life
[01:18:04.240 --> 01:18:08.240]  after years of research on the human microbiome. Not all probiotics are made the same.
[01:18:08.240 --> 01:18:13.240]  Floralife probiotics use a unique targeted delivery system that bypasses the stomach
[01:18:13.240 --> 01:18:17.240]  and releases directly into the intestines for maximum effect.
[01:18:17.240 --> 01:18:23.240]  This is critical because stomach acid kills most probiotics so if you don't have a targeted delivery probiotic
[01:18:23.240 --> 01:18:28.240]  then you're cheating your gut health and your wallet. Floralife supports your body's core
[01:18:28.240 --> 01:18:33.240]  where you need it most including digestion, regularity, immunity, the gut lining and metabolism.
[01:18:33.240 --> 01:18:37.240]  Did you know that over 80% of your immune system is located in your gut?
[01:18:37.240 --> 01:18:42.240]  That's why increasing gut probiotic levels is so important for overall health.
[01:18:42.240 --> 01:18:46.240]  Floralife is sold as a 15 billion probiotic for everyday maintenance care
[01:18:46.240 --> 01:18:50.240]  and a 50 billion probiotic for a 30 day advanced gut restoration program.

[01:19:40.240 --> 01:19:45.240]  Cardivore also contains digestive enzymes to help digest fats and carbohydrates
[01:19:45.240 --> 01:19:49.240]  so you can fully digest all types of meals. Don't let a meal go to waste.

[01:20:26.240 --> 01:20:40.240]  So the known Yellow Journalism King, Mr. Michael Wolf, the man that masquerades in journalist clothing
[01:20:40.240 --> 01:20:49.240]  he's come out with a huge whopper of a lie saying that President Trump is one of the biggest liars out there
[01:20:49.240 --> 01:20:56.240]  saying that he just doesn't do anything he says he'll do. Even CNN and MSNBC admit
[01:20:56.240 --> 01:21:00.240]  he's the promise keeper and that he's dangerous because he says what he really thinks
[01:21:00.240 --> 01:21:03.240]  and he's not a statesman that knows how to twist things.
[01:21:03.240 --> 01:21:10.240]  So Trump is known for telling the truth. Trump is known for being a straight shooter.
[01:21:10.240 --> 01:21:14.240]  Alex, I will not let you down. I'm going to win. We're going to cut the taxes.
[01:21:14.240 --> 01:21:17.240]  We're going to start securing the border. We're going to take care of the veterans.
[01:21:17.240 --> 01:21:24.240]  We're going to, he's been delivering. But oh, the little journalist who again only emerges it turns out
[01:21:24.240 --> 01:21:31.240]  I've looked like every decade, like if the clown emerges every decade or so to feed
[01:21:31.240 --> 01:21:37.240]  and then he kind of scurries back into the shadows and comes back out with some big fiasco book
[01:21:37.240 --> 01:21:43.240]  with lies and disinfo and false quotes according to people all mixed together with some truth.
[01:21:43.240 --> 01:21:49.240]  So this is him caught in the big enchilada lie and we'll go back to your phone calls.
[01:21:49.240 --> 01:21:53.240]  Would you release any of those recordings since your credibility is being questioned?
[01:21:53.240 --> 01:21:59.240]  My credibility is being questioned by a man who has less credibility
[01:21:59.240 --> 01:22:03.240]  than perhaps anyone who has ever walked on earth at this point.
[01:22:03.240 --> 01:22:05.240]  Before you stand by everything in the book, nothing made up.
[01:22:05.240 --> 01:22:07.240]  Absolutely everything in the book.
[01:22:07.240 --> 01:22:11.240]  Your former editor Vanity Fairgrain Carter said he wasn't surprised you'd written this explosive book.
[01:22:11.240 --> 01:22:15.240]  He was surprised they let you in the door at the White House.
[01:22:15.240 --> 01:22:17.240]  Are you surprised?
[01:22:17.240 --> 01:22:21.240]  No, I'm a nice guy. I go in.
[01:22:21.240 --> 01:22:23.240]  Did you flatter your way in?
[01:22:23.240 --> 01:22:25.240]  Let's stop right there.
[01:22:25.240 --> 01:22:29.240]  So Trump's a liar. He has the worst credibility, doesn't do what he says.
[01:22:29.240 --> 01:22:34.240]  And of course there's globalist operatives in the White House.
[01:22:34.240 --> 01:22:36.240]  That's what all this is about.
[01:22:36.240 --> 01:22:42.240]  And we know who lets you in. Stephen K. Bannon.
[01:22:42.240 --> 01:22:44.240]  It's reportedly in the book.
[01:22:44.240 --> 01:22:49.240]  Bannon lowered the drawbridge and in came the wolf.
[01:22:49.240 --> 01:22:51.240]  Kind of like Foghorn Leghorns.
[01:22:51.240 --> 01:22:54.240]  I'll say, I'll say, go away, boy, you bother me.
[01:22:54.240 --> 01:22:55.240]  There's a hen house over there.
[01:22:55.240 --> 01:22:57.240]  It's like, come on over here, dog.
[01:22:57.240 --> 01:23:00.240]  You look like a dog to me. Got a big bushy tail though.
[01:23:00.240 --> 01:23:03.240]  Big old teeth. Actually, there ain't no wolf.
[01:23:03.240 --> 01:23:08.240]  Well, I say, I say, I say, you go right on in there, my good buddy.
[01:23:08.240 --> 01:23:14.240]  I'm a nice guy. That's another joke.
[01:23:14.240 --> 01:23:17.240]  He's got one of the creepy photos.
[01:23:17.240 --> 01:23:21.240]  But man, the one I found this morning and I can't find it now, it's driving me up.
[01:23:21.240 --> 01:23:23.240]  It's like a full body shot of him in a suit.
[01:23:23.240 --> 01:23:26.240]  And he's got that demon smile going.
[01:23:26.240 --> 01:23:29.240]  Michael Wolf. Yeah, they've changed the photo now.
[01:23:29.240 --> 01:23:31.240]  It was down in the corner.
[01:23:31.240 --> 01:23:34.240]  Real Google images or tribe being or something else.
[01:23:34.240 --> 01:23:39.240]  Just type in a journalist or author, Michael Wolf.
[01:23:39.240 --> 01:23:49.240]  And again, Wolf admits not sure all true book sensation rocks nation.
[01:23:49.240 --> 01:23:52.240]  And he said he did whatever necessary to get the story.
[01:23:52.240 --> 01:23:55.240]  But again, just a really creepy person.
[01:23:55.240 --> 01:23:58.240]  Can we show him smiling? I want to show Stelter.
[01:23:58.240 --> 01:24:01.240]  I want to show the creepy photo that Drudge had up earlier.
[01:24:01.240 --> 01:24:04.240]  And I want to show the Stelter photo just to look upon.
[01:24:04.240 --> 01:24:07.240]  You think that guy's got a score to settle with humanity?
[01:24:07.240 --> 01:24:09.240]  You think that guy's got a chip on his shoulder?
[01:24:09.240 --> 01:24:13.240]  You think that guy and look at himself in the morning and say, I am literally
[01:24:13.240 --> 01:24:22.240]  the most disingenuous, demonic, filth bag the planet has ever seen.
[01:24:22.240 --> 01:24:24.240]  By the way, I don't just say this stuff.
[01:24:24.240 --> 01:24:28.240]  I call Mueller a criminal and a piece of garbage when nobody else would do it.
[01:24:28.240 --> 01:24:29.240]  They're all scared of the FBI.
[01:24:29.240 --> 01:24:34.240]  And when I called McCabe a criminal and I called Strock a criminal
[01:24:34.240 --> 01:24:37.240]  and I broke down how they were criminals, you notice months later exactly
[01:24:37.240 --> 01:24:41.240]  as I said, you now have the head of the Judiciary Committee in the Senate
[01:24:41.240 --> 01:24:44.240]  saying it's criminal and that they were organized and that it appears
[01:24:44.240 --> 01:24:47.240]  to be organized crime because that's what it is.
[01:24:47.240 --> 01:24:53.240]  I don't risk my life to sit here and get in these people's faces
[01:24:53.240 --> 01:24:55.240]  because I don't believe what I'm saying.
[01:24:55.240 --> 01:25:04.240]  I know these men are garbage.
[01:25:04.240 --> 01:25:08.240]  And so is the entire leftist operation delivering the women of America
[01:25:08.240 --> 01:25:12.240]  into the hands of the new Gloria Steinem, as if she wasn't damaging enough
[01:25:12.240 --> 01:25:17.240]  for women, Linda Sorcer.
[01:25:17.240 --> 01:25:21.240]  Linda Sorcer, you aren't given that feminist leadership position
[01:25:21.240 --> 01:25:28.240]  in the Ford Foundation, the Carnegie Endowment, and usually the CIA.
[01:25:28.240 --> 01:25:34.240]  Gloria Steinem was hired in college by the Central Intelligence Agency
[01:25:34.240 --> 01:25:39.240]  to carry out the breakup of the family, had nothing to do with empowering women.
[01:25:39.240 --> 01:25:43.240]  And now they are saying women taking off their hijabs is a stunt in Iran
[01:25:43.240 --> 01:25:50.240]  and they are bad.
[01:25:50.240 --> 01:25:54.240]  Non-Muslim women expect executed and raped and massed in Burma,
[01:25:54.240 --> 01:25:56.240]  not a peep out of conservative American women.
[01:25:56.240 --> 01:25:58.240]  Now they are all up in arms on Iran.
[01:25:58.240 --> 01:26:00.240]  Selective outrage is not a good look.
[01:26:00.240 --> 01:26:07.240]  Oh, Linda Sorcer.
[01:26:07.240 --> 01:26:11.240]  And of course there's been news about Burma and the civil wars going on there.
[01:26:11.240 --> 01:26:15.240]  By the way, the UN ran exterminating the non-Muslims
[01:26:15.240 --> 01:26:18.240]  what was that 20 years ago to bring the Muslims in,
[01:26:18.240 --> 01:26:19.240]  just like they do in Africa.
[01:26:19.240 --> 01:26:22.240]  Alright, I'm sorry, I'm going to go back to Carlos and I'll get to more of your calls here.
[01:26:22.240 --> 01:26:26.240]  Carlos, I guess let's do a plug since I don't know what you're going to say,
[01:26:26.240 --> 01:26:31.240]  but what do you think of our X2 true atomic iodine?
[01:26:31.240 --> 01:26:34.240]  Well, I want to tell you that one of the greatest contributions
[01:26:34.240 --> 01:26:39.240]  that are being made by Info Wars to society today is your products,
[01:26:39.240 --> 01:26:45.240]  among which is my favorite, which is the survival X2 iodine product.
[01:26:45.240 --> 01:26:48.240]  I want to tell you something about iodine that people don't realize.
[01:26:48.240 --> 01:26:51.240]  Even Mr. Bannon and Mr. Wolfe should probably check themselves
[01:26:51.240 --> 01:26:53.240]  because they're probably iodine deficient,
[01:26:53.240 --> 01:26:56.240]  not removing enough of the fluoride in their body.
[01:26:56.240 --> 01:27:02.240]  I want to tell you that up to 50% of the American population
[01:27:02.240 --> 01:27:06.240]  and Canadian population as well may be deficient in iodine.
[01:27:06.240 --> 01:27:07.240]  Iodine is a mineral.
[01:27:07.240 --> 01:27:10.240]  It's one of the elements in the periodic table.
[01:27:10.240 --> 01:27:17.240]  And you do not get this iodine from plants or from food because they produce it.
[01:27:17.240 --> 01:27:19.240]  They get it from the soil.
[01:27:19.240 --> 01:27:25.240]  And you, consuming the food, uptake the iodine.
[01:27:25.240 --> 01:27:30.240]  Iodine is essential to every cell development, especially in children.
[01:27:30.240 --> 01:27:38.240]  And iodine is concentrated in the thyroid gland primarily there,
[01:27:38.240 --> 01:27:42.240]  where it filters the serum coming through your blood
[01:27:42.240 --> 01:27:45.240]  and it extracts whatever iodine is present.
[01:27:45.240 --> 01:27:49.240]  If the iodine is not present in sufficient numbers,
[01:27:49.240 --> 01:27:52.240]  your thyroid gland has to work double time.
[01:27:52.240 --> 01:27:57.240]  In the extreme, it has to, it reaches the limit.
[01:27:57.240 --> 01:28:02.240]  So then the pituitary gland sends thyroid growth hormone to it
[01:28:02.240 --> 01:28:08.240]  to make sure that it's bigger so it can process more serum and get more iodine from it.
[01:28:08.240 --> 01:28:12.240]  In the ultimate extreme, it's called goiter.
[01:28:12.240 --> 01:28:14.240]  It's a disease.
[01:28:14.240 --> 01:28:20.240]  People don't realize that if you are short of iodine, if you're deficient,
[01:28:20.240 --> 01:28:24.240]  you will, your cells will not mature properly, develop,
[01:28:24.240 --> 01:28:28.240]  and never mind radiation coming from Fukushima.
[01:28:28.240 --> 01:28:33.240]  But at the same time, iodine enables your cells to develop.
[01:28:33.240 --> 01:28:37.240]  And it's very important for muscular brain development.
[01:28:37.240 --> 01:28:42.240]  A lot of brain problems and breast cancer may be attributable to iodine deficiency.
[01:28:42.240 --> 01:28:45.240]  And by the way, you can just search engine mainstream news admits,
[01:28:45.240 --> 01:28:48.240]  iodine deficiency on average, 15 IQ point reductions,
[01:28:48.240 --> 01:28:51.240]  and then fluoride added, another 15, it's all admitted.
[01:28:51.240 --> 01:28:55.240]  This is a plan where they bomb us with a bad halogen that our thyroid then uses
[01:28:55.240 --> 01:28:57.240]  and it basically then gives us the swollen thyroid.
[01:28:57.240 --> 01:28:58.240]  It's a no brainer.
[01:28:58.240 --> 01:29:00.240]  A big burky water filter is the one you need, period.
[01:29:00.240 --> 01:29:04.240]  You need a water filter that removes chlorine, fluoride, pharmaceuticals,
[01:29:04.240 --> 01:29:06.240]  BPA, and other endocrine disruptors,
[01:29:06.240 --> 01:29:09.240]  pesticides, bacteria, viruses, and much more, right?

[01:29:27.240 --> 01:29:30.240]  This is Dan Pilla. Do you owe the IRS money you can't pay?
[01:29:30.240 --> 01:29:32.240]  Are tax debts crippling you?
[01:29:32.240 --> 01:29:34.240]  I've defended people from the IRS for over 30 years.

[01:29:37.240 --> 01:29:39.240]  I wrote the book on IRS settlement and I'm telling you,
[01:29:39.240 --> 01:29:41.240]  there's no such thing as a hopeless case.
[01:29:41.240 --> 01:29:45.240]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX to finally get free of IRS debt.

[01:29:49.240 --> 01:29:51.240]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX.
[01:29:51.240 --> 01:30:20.240]  That's 800-34-NO-TAX or my website, danpilla.com.
[01:30:21.240 --> 01:30:24.240]  In the history of M4's life, we've brought out a lot of amazing products
[01:30:24.240 --> 01:30:28.240]  like Survival Shield X2, SuperMail Vitality and so many others.
[01:30:28.240 --> 01:30:32.240]  With its unique delivery system and proprietary manufacturing process
[01:30:32.240 --> 01:30:36.240]  designed for maximized effects, this formula is the platinum standard
[01:30:36.240 --> 01:30:40.240]  of multivitamin mineral products and this part is most important.
[01:30:40.240 --> 01:30:44.240]  The ingredients in vitamin mineral fusion are either plant derived
[01:30:44.240 --> 01:30:47.240]  or of the highest quality lab standard.
[01:30:47.240 --> 01:30:51.240]  That means it's clean, that means it's pure and rest secured,
[01:30:51.240 --> 01:30:53.240]  you're funding the tip of the spear in the info war.
[01:30:53.240 --> 01:30:56.240]  That's infowarslife.com and vitamin mineral fusion.

[01:31:07.240 --> 01:31:10.240]  Number one, when you choose auto ship before checkout,
[01:31:10.240 --> 01:31:14.240]  we give you 10% off on your order at infowarsore.com.
[01:31:14.240 --> 01:31:17.240]  Number two, you're also able to get items that are out of stock
[01:31:17.240 --> 01:31:20.240]  when you sign up for auto ship because we hold back a surplus
[01:31:20.240 --> 01:31:22.240]  for auto ship customers.
[01:31:22.240 --> 01:31:25.240]  Number three, we're giving you free shipping on all orders
[01:31:25.240 --> 01:31:27.240]  above $50.
[01:31:27.240 --> 01:31:29.240]  Listeners have been requesting this for years
[01:31:29.240 --> 01:31:32.240]  because it's so easy to forget to reorder the products
[01:31:32.240 --> 01:31:33.240]  that you need each month.
[01:31:33.240 --> 01:31:36.240]  Just go to infowarsore.com, select your favorite product

[01:31:41.240 --> 01:31:44.240]  As you know, I coined the term 360 win.
[01:31:44.240 --> 01:31:46.240]  And with the new auto ship feature at infowarsore.com,
[01:31:46.240 --> 01:31:48.240]  this is a sure win.
[01:31:48.240 --> 01:31:50.240]  10% off on auto ship.
[01:31:50.240 --> 01:31:53.240]  Win, win, win at infowarsore.com, free shipping on orders above $50.
[01:31:53.240 --> 01:31:56.240]  And all out of stock items are never out of stock
[01:31:56.240 --> 01:31:58.240]  when you sign up for auto ship.
[01:31:58.240 --> 01:32:02.240]  Brett Smith, author of Thump, The First Bundred Days,
[01:32:02.240 --> 01:32:04.240]  explained to people about Thump
[01:32:04.240 --> 01:32:07.240]  and why this is an important book and how it ties into things.
[01:32:07.240 --> 01:32:09.240]  And I just thought to myself, you know, this is brilliant.
[01:32:09.240 --> 01:32:11.240]  This is the ultimate juxtaposition
[01:32:11.240 --> 01:32:14.240]  of what everyone says about the president.
[01:32:14.240 --> 01:32:17.240]  You know, they say that he's a racist, misogynist,
[01:32:17.240 --> 01:32:19.240]  sexist, bigoted, homophobic Nazi.
[01:32:19.240 --> 01:32:21.240]  So what better way to counter that
[01:32:21.240 --> 01:32:23.240]  than by turning him into an incredibly cute,
[01:32:23.240 --> 01:32:25.240]  lovable, fluffy little bunny.
[01:32:25.240 --> 01:32:27.240]  It's got that fun, rhyming structure to it.
[01:32:27.240 --> 01:32:28.240]  It's actually hilarious.
[01:32:28.240 --> 01:32:30.240]  I was cracking up reading the whole book.
[01:32:30.240 --> 01:32:31.240]  My wife was cracking up.
[01:32:31.240 --> 01:32:32.240]  And it's a great book for adults.
[01:32:32.240 --> 01:32:33.240]  It's a great book for children.
[01:32:33.240 --> 01:32:35.240]  We're selling the book.
[01:32:35.240 --> 01:32:37.240]  We've got it bundled as well.
[01:32:37.240 --> 01:32:40.240]  Here with a one-off poster.
[01:32:40.240 --> 01:32:41.240]  That's a collector's item.
[01:32:41.240 --> 01:32:43.240]  Both of these, the book, the graphic novel,
[01:32:43.240 --> 01:32:45.240]  and the poster are $29.95.
[01:32:45.240 --> 01:32:46.240]  That helps support us.
[01:32:46.240 --> 01:32:48.240]  So get the book Thump, The First Hundred Days,
[01:32:48.240 --> 01:32:51.240]  and Alex Jones, and Thump, The Art of Info Wars
[01:32:51.240 --> 01:33:09.240]  for a limited edition at infowarsstore.com.
[01:33:22.240 --> 01:33:25.240]  We are back taking your phone calls.
[01:33:25.240 --> 01:33:28.240]  We've got Zach, formerly with Army Special Operations Intelligence,
[01:33:28.240 --> 01:33:30.240]  a great source of not-classified info,
[01:33:30.240 --> 01:33:33.240]  but a humant analysis of now a private citizen
[01:33:33.240 --> 01:33:36.240]  and contractor with unnamed groups.
[01:33:36.240 --> 01:33:39.240]  He's going to be joining us from Morocco.
[01:33:39.240 --> 01:33:41.240]  And then Millie Weaver is going to come in
[01:33:41.240 --> 01:33:44.240]  with a big report she filed that we're going to premiere here.
[01:33:44.240 --> 01:33:47.240]  Do some investigation into the Democrats and their mindset.
[01:33:47.240 --> 01:33:49.240]  But no kidding.
[01:33:49.240 --> 01:33:53.240]  Media Matters is writing like five disinfo pieces
[01:33:53.240 --> 01:33:54.240]  against us a day.
[01:33:54.240 --> 01:33:56.240]  And then when they write the disinfo piece funded by Soros,
[01:33:56.240 --> 01:33:58.240]  this is admitted, then mainstream media,
[01:33:58.240 --> 01:34:01.240]  that's their green light that it's okay to report on.
[01:34:01.240 --> 01:34:03.240]  And it's really ridiculous.
[01:34:03.240 --> 01:34:05.240]  Here's the latest article.
[01:34:05.240 --> 01:34:07.240]  I didn't mean this to be a plug, but it is a plug.
[01:34:07.240 --> 01:34:10.240]  Thump, The First Hundred Days,
[01:34:10.240 --> 01:34:13.240]  about Trump being a nice little bunny,
[01:34:13.240 --> 01:34:15.240]  to counter them saying he's a Nazi and a murderer
[01:34:15.240 --> 01:34:17.240]  and all these other things.
[01:34:17.240 --> 01:34:21.240]  Well, guess what? They say that this is a white supremacist book.
[01:34:21.240 --> 01:34:24.240]  Alex Jones is hawking pro-Trump children's book
[01:34:24.240 --> 01:34:26.240]  that indoctrinates them to white nationalism.
[01:34:26.240 --> 01:34:27.240]  Why?
[01:34:27.240 --> 01:34:29.240]  Because some of the people in the book are white
[01:34:29.240 --> 01:34:33.240]  and the bunny rabbit has blonde hair.
[01:34:33.240 --> 01:34:35.240]  I'm not kidding.
[01:34:35.240 --> 01:34:38.240]  There are black bunnies too, by the way, and brown bunnies.
[01:34:38.240 --> 01:34:40.240]  And so again, that's just their job.
[01:34:40.240 --> 01:34:44.240]  Meanwhile, they have another article out saying,
[01:34:44.240 --> 01:34:47.240]  Alex Jones claims that Brian Stelter
[01:34:47.240 --> 01:34:49.240]  is basically drinking your children's blood.
[01:34:49.240 --> 01:34:52.240]  What I said is culturally, like a psychic vampire,
[01:34:52.240 --> 01:34:55.240]  he's drunk on our children, our future's blood.
[01:34:55.240 --> 01:34:57.240]  Yes, they're trying to destroy our future,
[01:34:57.240 --> 01:34:59.240]  trying to break up our families.
[01:34:59.240 --> 01:35:01.240]  They're pushing all this anti-American garbage.
[01:35:01.240 --> 01:35:03.240]  They're pushing pro-Arab spring, all this stuff.
[01:35:03.240 --> 01:35:08.240]  That is drunk on our collective children's future.
[01:35:08.240 --> 01:35:11.240]  And that is, again, a metaphysical allegory
[01:35:11.240 --> 01:35:13.240]  that is extremely clear.
[01:35:13.240 --> 01:35:15.240]  He is actually drinking their blood.
[01:35:15.240 --> 01:35:17.240]  But they'll edit it together and put that out.
[01:35:17.240 --> 01:35:19.240]  And that's fine, go ahead.
[01:35:19.240 --> 01:35:21.240]  Jones threatens Stelter, you will pay, yeah.
[01:35:21.240 --> 01:35:23.240]  You don't think I see your face scum?
[01:35:23.240 --> 01:35:25.240]  Yes, he has scum, lying scum.
[01:35:25.240 --> 01:35:27.240]  You don't think I don't see you, Stelter?
[01:35:27.240 --> 01:35:30.240]  And now everyone will look at his demonic face
[01:35:30.240 --> 01:35:33.240]  and think about how he's leering and smiling at you
[01:35:33.240 --> 01:35:36.240]  and thinks he's better than you.
[01:35:36.240 --> 01:35:41.240]  So again, Soros, you will deliver yourself
[01:35:41.240 --> 01:35:43.240]  into our hands.
[01:35:43.240 --> 01:35:45.240]  Yeah, yeah, let's put him on the front of the screen here.
[01:35:45.240 --> 01:35:48.240]  Oh my gosh, I mean, that is literally
[01:35:48.240 --> 01:35:51.240]  an arrogant servant of the system.
[01:35:51.240 --> 01:35:54.240]  Narcissism, pettiness,
[01:35:54.240 --> 01:35:58.240]  peabrandedness, the example of everything
[01:35:58.240 --> 01:36:02.240]  that men shouldn't be, namely, not being a man.
[01:36:02.240 --> 01:36:08.240]  That's a wimp that wants to squat over America
[01:36:08.240 --> 01:36:12.240]  and run everybody's lives to make himself feel like he's somebody.
[01:36:12.240 --> 01:36:14.240]  That's the spirit.
[01:36:14.240 --> 01:36:18.240]  Thump, the first bundled days.
[01:36:18.240 --> 01:36:20.240]  And you get with it, the Alex and Thump,
[01:36:20.240 --> 01:36:23.240]  the art of Info Wars, collector's poster,
[01:36:23.240 --> 01:36:27.240]  America First in 1776, infowars.com.
[01:36:27.240 --> 01:36:29.240]  Yes, you heard it.
[01:36:29.240 --> 01:36:31.240]  They're not saying just having white people in movies,
[01:36:31.240 --> 01:36:35.240]  period is racist, and milk is racist, so there's a new level.
[01:36:35.240 --> 01:36:40.240]  Now, bunny rabbits are white nationalists.
[01:36:40.240 --> 01:36:43.240]  Here we go, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:36:43.240 --> 01:36:52.240]  Again, this is simply amazing.
[01:36:52.240 --> 01:36:55.240]  This is white supremacists, I guess,
[01:36:55.240 --> 01:36:57.240]  because there's white people.
[01:36:57.240 --> 01:37:07.240]  This is all they can do.
[01:37:07.240 --> 01:37:13.240]  It's incredible, and it's all meant to trigger them.
[01:37:13.240 --> 01:37:18.240]  And look, there's brown bunnies and black bunnies,
[01:37:18.240 --> 01:37:25.240]  but the teddy bear, he's left behind.
[01:37:25.240 --> 01:37:27.240]  I'll say this, there are a lot of coded messages in here,
[01:37:27.240 --> 01:37:30.240]  but it's not racist messages.
[01:37:30.240 --> 01:37:31.240]  Very well done.
[01:37:31.240 --> 01:37:37.240]  That's why the last one they did was the number one New York Times bestseller.
[01:37:37.240 --> 01:37:41.240]  Spirit cooking, and you read this, you learn it.
[01:37:41.240 --> 01:37:42.240]  Oh, and they are so scared.
[01:37:42.240 --> 01:37:45.240]  And look, basket of deplorables, black bunnies,
[01:37:45.240 --> 01:37:48.240]  brown bunnies, pink bunnies, gray bunnies,
[01:37:48.240 --> 01:37:50.240]  and other little creatures.
[01:37:50.240 --> 01:37:51.240]  Look how hateful this is.
[01:37:51.240 --> 01:37:53.240]  This is very hateful.
[01:37:53.240 --> 01:37:58.240]  You've got the rhino media, because, you know, rhinos are gray.
[01:37:58.240 --> 01:38:01.240]  See, that's why it's racist, because there's an animal that's gray,
[01:38:01.240 --> 01:38:02.240]  and that's coded racism.
[01:38:02.240 --> 01:38:03.240]  No, it's not.
[01:38:03.240 --> 01:38:07.240]  It's right out in the open that rhinos are Republican name only.
[01:38:07.240 --> 01:38:08.240]  That's what that means.
[01:38:08.240 --> 01:38:11.240]  Nothing to do with race.
[01:38:11.240 --> 01:38:14.240]  And the bunny went in his little litter box
[01:38:14.240 --> 01:38:16.240]  and pooped on the New York Times,
[01:38:16.240 --> 01:38:19.240]  because that's all it's good for.
[01:38:19.240 --> 01:38:22.240]  Wow.
[01:38:22.240 --> 01:38:24.240]  This is amazing.
[01:38:24.240 --> 01:38:26.240]  This is absolutely amazing.
[01:38:26.240 --> 01:38:27.240]  And then you've got Soros.
[01:38:27.240 --> 01:38:29.240]  He's like the claw from Inspector Gadget.
[01:38:29.240 --> 01:38:35.240]  I will get you next time, bunny, next time.
[01:38:35.240 --> 01:38:39.240]  Very, very, very well done.
[01:38:39.240 --> 01:38:41.240]  There's the evil bunny.
[01:38:41.240 --> 01:38:43.240]  Oh, liberal tears.
[01:38:43.240 --> 01:38:45.240]  Good bunny.
[01:38:45.240 --> 01:38:49.240]  I think the one of Rex Tillerson,
[01:38:49.240 --> 01:38:51.240]  I think that looks like Robert Mueller.
[01:38:51.240 --> 01:38:56.240]  Robert Mueller looks like a seriously evil person.
[01:38:56.240 --> 01:38:58.240]  And he's on a power trip about it.
[01:38:58.240 --> 01:39:00.240]  Oh, we're so scared of you.
[01:39:00.240 --> 01:39:01.240]  We're so scared.
[01:39:01.240 --> 01:39:09.240]  We're so scared of the paramilitary death squads America's always had.
[01:39:09.240 --> 01:39:16.240]  Those people ought to be concerned about those people.
[01:39:16.240 --> 01:39:19.240]  You think the soldiers and people like the globalist scum,
[01:39:19.240 --> 01:39:21.240]  like having little hunchback demons
[01:39:21.240 --> 01:39:24.240]  ordered them around, backstabbing cowards.
[01:39:24.240 --> 01:39:25.240]  I think people like you.
[01:39:25.240 --> 01:39:27.240]  They hate you.
[01:39:27.240 --> 01:39:28.240]  Everyone hates you.
[01:39:28.240 --> 01:39:30.240]  Who's got a brain?
[01:39:30.240 --> 01:39:34.240]  Soros, you old stinkin' Nazi collaborator.
[01:39:34.240 --> 01:39:36.240]  We're going to have CNN come out again and say that,
[01:39:36.240 --> 01:39:39.240]  oh, contrary to popular belief,
[01:39:39.240 --> 01:39:45.240]  Alex Jones is lying about Soros being a Nazi collaborator.
[01:39:45.240 --> 01:39:48.240]  And they now have that as a little talking point
[01:39:48.240 --> 01:39:51.240]  that Jones put out the preposterous lie
[01:39:51.240 --> 01:39:55.240]  that Soros ever was even associated with the Nazis.
[01:39:55.240 --> 01:39:56.240]  Why?
[01:39:56.240 --> 01:39:57.240]  He's an angel.
[01:39:57.240 --> 01:40:00.240]  He's a wonderful person.
[01:40:00.240 --> 01:40:01.240]  Let's go to your phone calls.
[01:40:01.240 --> 01:40:02.240]  Let's see what we got here.
[01:40:02.240 --> 01:40:05.240]  John, Dan, Steve, Marcus, Debbie, Miles, Brendan, Greg, Luke.
[01:40:05.240 --> 01:40:07.240]  And the callers are all so good.
[01:40:07.240 --> 01:40:08.240]  I'm going to turn the call off for 10 minutes.
[01:40:08.240 --> 01:40:09.240]  We've got to get to you now.
[01:40:09.240 --> 01:40:11.240]  And I appreciate you calling.
[01:40:11.240 --> 01:40:13.240]  Let's go ahead and talk to John in California.
[01:40:13.240 --> 01:40:14.240]  You're on the air.
[01:40:14.240 --> 01:40:16.240]  Welcome, John.
[01:40:16.240 --> 01:40:18.240]  Today.
[01:40:18.240 --> 01:40:20.240]  Welcome.
[01:40:20.240 --> 01:40:22.240]  I'm sorry.
[01:40:22.240 --> 01:40:23.240]  It's OK.
[01:40:23.240 --> 01:40:25.240]  I understand your phone's breaking up a bit.
[01:40:25.240 --> 01:40:27.240]  Go ahead.
[01:40:27.240 --> 01:40:29.240]  I'm going to put John on hold and come back to him
[01:40:29.240 --> 01:40:31.240]  when he gets to a better place.
[01:40:31.240 --> 01:40:34.240]  Let's go ahead and talk to Miles.
[01:40:34.240 --> 01:40:36.240]  Miles in Missouri are on the air.
[01:40:36.240 --> 01:40:37.240]  Go ahead.
[01:40:37.240 --> 01:40:39.240]  Alex, it's Miles.
[01:40:39.240 --> 01:40:40.240]  I'm actually in Michigan.
[01:40:40.240 --> 01:40:41.240]  OK, go ahead.
[01:40:41.240 --> 01:40:42.240]  I'm in Missouri.
[01:40:42.240 --> 01:40:44.240]  But I just wanted to say that you are totally
[01:40:44.240 --> 01:40:47.240]  on point with how evil these people are.
[01:40:47.240 --> 01:40:49.240]  And they know that they're evil.
[01:40:49.240 --> 01:40:53.240]  I want your listeners to know that they know how evil they are.
[01:40:53.240 --> 01:40:55.240]  They're doing it behind a smile.
[01:40:55.240 --> 01:40:58.240]  They smile on your face, and they put out all these things
[01:40:58.240 --> 01:41:01.240]  that are just torturous to your kids and your family.
[01:41:01.240 --> 01:41:03.240]  And that's what they've been doing for a long time.
[01:41:03.240 --> 01:41:05.240]  But now it's mainstream.
[01:41:05.240 --> 01:41:06.240]  They're all over Instagram.
[01:41:06.240 --> 01:41:11.240]  They have rappers out there that are totally destroying your kids.
[01:41:11.240 --> 01:41:12.240]  There's a guy named Little Peep.
[01:41:12.240 --> 01:41:13.240]  He just died.
[01:41:13.240 --> 01:41:15.240]  O.D. on Danex.
[01:41:15.240 --> 01:41:18.240]  But this guy was out there making songs about doing Danex.
[01:41:18.240 --> 01:41:19.240]  And then he O.D.'s on it.
[01:41:19.240 --> 01:41:21.240]  And so many people love him.
[01:41:21.240 --> 01:41:23.240]  They're all young kids.
[01:41:23.240 --> 01:41:26.240]  I just wanted to say they know how evil they are
[01:41:26.240 --> 01:41:29.240]  and that you're right for calling them out.
[01:41:29.240 --> 01:41:30.240]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:41:30.240 --> 01:41:32.240]  YouTube will block and take down our videos.
[01:41:32.240 --> 01:41:35.240]  And Brad, the number one mission is to block us.
[01:41:35.240 --> 01:41:36.240]  We have a hidden camera.
[01:41:36.240 --> 01:41:39.240]  Take Veritas and how they work with the New York Times
[01:41:39.240 --> 01:41:41.240]  when the New York Times wants us censored.
[01:41:41.240 --> 01:41:44.240]  And they're all together, just like they're coordinating with Hillary.
[01:41:44.240 --> 01:41:45.240]  But Snoop says that isn't true.
[01:41:45.240 --> 01:41:51.240]  They also say that rules for radicals wasn't pledged to Lucifer.
[01:41:51.240 --> 01:41:53.240]  But then they admit, well, it was, but he didn't mean it.
[01:41:53.240 --> 01:41:54.240]  It was a metaphor.
[01:41:54.240 --> 01:41:58.240]  But the Logan Paul suicide video shows YouTube
[01:41:58.240 --> 01:42:00.240]  is facing a crucial turning point.
[01:42:00.240 --> 01:42:01.240]  Oh, yes.
[01:42:01.240 --> 01:42:03.240]  And they're letting it stay up.
[01:42:03.240 --> 01:42:04.240]  He took it down.
[01:42:04.240 --> 01:42:08.240]  They let others put it up as he makes fun of somebody that committed suicide
[01:42:08.240 --> 01:42:09.240]  and their dead body.
[01:42:09.240 --> 01:42:11.240]  That is weasel porn.
[01:42:11.240 --> 01:42:12.240]  It's death porn.
[01:42:12.240 --> 01:42:17.240]  It's where you get off on somebody else's pain from your pathetic position
[01:42:17.240 --> 01:42:19.240]  and then make everything a big joke.
[01:42:19.240 --> 01:42:21.240]  So when you're getting killed or dying, no one cares about you.
[01:42:21.240 --> 01:42:25.240]  It's training you to be alone and to be a victim and to be an idiot.
[01:42:25.240 --> 01:42:28.240]  But to think it's funny.
[01:42:28.240 --> 01:42:29.240]  Absolutely.
[01:42:29.240 --> 01:42:30.240]  You're nailing it 100%.
[01:42:30.240 --> 01:42:32.240]  You know what's going on.
[01:42:32.240 --> 01:42:33.240]  No, you do, brother.
[01:42:33.240 --> 01:42:35.240]  Miles got blessed in Michigan.
[01:42:35.240 --> 01:42:39.240]  I tell you, I've always, I've had 2015 vision until now.
[01:42:39.240 --> 01:42:44.240]  And so my vision at 44 is starting to, starting to go here.
[01:42:44.240 --> 01:42:47.240]  They're under these lights all the years too.
[01:42:47.240 --> 01:42:48.240]  I can tell you that.
[01:42:48.240 --> 01:42:49.240]  We'll be right back.
[01:42:49.240 --> 01:43:17.240]  Stay with us.
[01:43:19.240 --> 01:43:26.240]  We'll be right back.
[01:43:49.240 --> 01:43:56.240]  We'll be right back.
[01:44:19.240 --> 01:44:45.240]  We'll be right back.
[01:44:45.240 --> 01:44:52.240]  We'll be right back.
[01:45:15.240 --> 01:45:41.240]  We'll be right back.
[01:45:41.240 --> 01:45:57.240]  We'll be right back.
[01:45:57.240 --> 01:46:24.240]  We'll be right back.
[01:46:24.240 --> 01:46:42.240]  We'll be right back.
[01:46:42.240 --> 01:47:04.240]  We'll be right back.
[01:47:12.240 --> 01:47:27.240]  We're taking your phone calls, not that I have any lack of news.
[01:47:27.240 --> 01:47:32.240]  I remember first reporting on these types of things 20 years ago from our NSA sources,
[01:47:32.240 --> 01:47:37.240]  both public and private, that all the major computer chips worldwide being built had specifications
[01:47:37.240 --> 01:47:42.240]  going into them in the EU, in the US, in China, Japan.
[01:47:42.240 --> 01:47:45.240]  They all get together on these boards, these multinational boards.
[01:47:45.240 --> 01:47:49.240]  That's why globalism is important to have one central system of control.
[01:47:49.240 --> 01:47:53.240]  You can also have monopolies and vertically integrate economies to control populations
[01:47:53.240 --> 01:47:57.240]  and stop the threat of technologies from being developed, deployed to the people's use
[01:47:57.240 --> 01:47:59.240]  and enjoyment and betterment.
[01:47:59.240 --> 01:48:03.240]  But major chip flaws affect billions of devices.
[01:48:03.240 --> 01:48:08.240]  Every last government-backed body worn the chips themselves need to be replaced to completely fix the problems.
[01:48:08.240 --> 01:48:13.240]  The flaws could allow an attacker to read sensitive data stored in the memory like passwords
[01:48:13.240 --> 01:48:17.240]  or look at what tabs someone has open on their computer.
[01:48:17.240 --> 01:48:18.240]  Researchers found.
[01:48:18.240 --> 01:48:20.240]  Oh, researchers found.
[01:48:20.240 --> 01:48:27.240]  Yeah, it's called WikiLeaks and it's called Vault 7, Vault 8.
[01:48:27.240 --> 01:48:35.240]  There's all the exploit programs, hundreds of them, that they use by design with backdoors built in
[01:48:35.240 --> 01:48:38.240]  to get into all of your software and hardware.
[01:48:38.240 --> 01:48:40.240]  And let me give you a little news flash.
[01:48:40.240 --> 01:48:43.240]  They got chips in them now with data over power line.
[01:48:43.240 --> 01:48:47.240]  And then when you put in the smart meters and they put in modern smart houses,
[01:48:47.240 --> 01:48:53.240]  you have electricity itself as a conduit for data.
[01:48:53.240 --> 01:49:00.240]  The modern light bulbs that they mandated, the little curly Cubans,
[01:49:00.240 --> 01:49:08.240]  those are mandated because they have a blurb technology where it's oscillating so fast
[01:49:08.240 --> 01:49:14.240]  as a code communication with many of the new devices inside computers and outside computers.
[01:49:14.240 --> 01:49:16.240]  Things you use and things you don't even know about.
[01:49:16.240 --> 01:49:23.240]  Also, I was told 20 years ago that they had transceiver chips in your computers that you think are just a chip,
[01:49:23.240 --> 01:49:30.240]  but they can receive and transmit even if the computer is walled off and not on the Internet.
[01:49:30.240 --> 01:49:34.240]  And even if the computer is off.
[01:49:34.240 --> 01:49:37.240]  Now, of course, that came out 20 years after I told you came out last year.
[01:49:37.240 --> 01:49:41.240]  So again, 20 years.
[01:49:41.240 --> 01:49:45.240]  The news of 20 years from now today.
[01:49:45.240 --> 01:49:48.240]  But we get to read about, oh, let me see.
[01:49:48.240 --> 01:49:50.240]  I go to CNN reliable.
[01:49:50.240 --> 01:49:52.240]  Oh, my gosh, CNN's got me some really good.
[01:49:52.240 --> 01:50:03.240]  Oh, a government body is now warning everyone because when WikiLeaks put all that out.
[01:50:03.240 --> 01:50:04.240]  Well, now all the hackers know.
[01:50:04.240 --> 01:50:05.240]  Here's a little secret.
[01:50:05.240 --> 01:50:07.240]  They already all knew.
[01:50:07.240 --> 01:50:13.240]  They already know and they already imagine what the new hacks are.
[01:50:13.240 --> 01:50:15.240]  And then they go and try stuff.
[01:50:15.240 --> 01:50:17.240]  Oh, where's the back door?
[01:50:17.240 --> 01:50:24.240]  See, if someone knows that there's an unguarded back door on every house that you cannot lock,
[01:50:24.240 --> 01:50:26.240]  what are thieves going to start doing?
[01:50:26.240 --> 01:50:29.240]  They're going to start looking for the back door.
[01:50:29.240 --> 01:50:32.240]  So in the great wisdom of whoever really runs WikiLeaks,
[01:50:32.240 --> 01:50:37.240]  in the great U.S. intelligence operatives that are fighting the globalists.
[01:50:37.240 --> 01:50:39.240]  And that's a fact, by the way.
[01:50:39.240 --> 01:50:46.240]  Julian Assange is a deep, deep rogue state U.S. intelligence group.
[01:50:46.240 --> 01:50:48.240]  I'm just going to leave it at that.
[01:50:48.240 --> 01:50:50.240]  So just more, I think you need to know.
[01:50:50.240 --> 01:50:52.240]  It's the time of things to be revealed for everybody here.
[01:50:52.240 --> 01:50:53.240]  It's not the Russians.
[01:50:53.240 --> 01:51:00.240]  And because elements of our government also discovered that it was an exploit against the public,
[01:51:00.240 --> 01:51:07.240]  but also a double deal with China and that China has been given all the information is using it against us in a double cross,
[01:51:07.240 --> 01:51:14.240]  including putting it in chips that if a critical defense that they weren't supposed to.
[01:51:14.240 --> 01:51:26.240]  And it goes on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on.
[01:51:26.240 --> 01:51:27.240]  Oh, but you read this.
[01:51:27.240 --> 01:51:34.240]  See, now they've got to tell you, oh, your computers all have backdoors in them.
[01:51:34.240 --> 01:51:41.720]  Oh, but members of the FBI, after what happened at San Bernardino, they needed Apple to give
[01:51:41.720 --> 01:51:43.480]  them the code to break into the phone.
[01:51:43.480 --> 01:51:47.280]  No, they wanted the code to everything.
[01:51:47.280 --> 01:51:54.280]  And that was because Apple hadn't given them all the back doors yet.
[01:51:54.280 --> 01:51:57.760]  Because Apple executives didn't want to be spied on.
[01:51:57.760 --> 01:52:04.280]  You see, Apple executives don't put basically any apps on their phones.
[01:52:04.280 --> 01:52:07.720]  Because it's the apps of the back doors.
[01:52:07.720 --> 01:52:11.840]  All the major big free apps that companies put out, back doors.
[01:52:11.840 --> 01:52:15.440]  And the control freaks in Silicon Valley can't help it, even when it's not a government program,
[01:52:15.440 --> 01:52:16.880]  they put little back doors in for themselves.
[01:52:16.880 --> 01:52:20.280]  Because you know the type of data you can get on, say, an app that's been downloaded by
[01:52:20.280 --> 01:52:25.000]  5, 6, 7, 10 million, 20 million people.
[01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:28.500]  It's incalculable.
[01:52:28.500 --> 01:52:32.960]  They were spying on people's apps at Google and knew Trump was going to win by 20 points.
[01:52:32.960 --> 01:52:34.520]  Total landslides.
[01:52:34.520 --> 01:52:39.560]  That's why they were panicking so hard, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:52:39.560 --> 01:52:41.280]  That's just one article out of probably 300 moustacs.
[01:52:41.280 --> 01:52:43.000]  See, I could talk all day just about this.
[01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:49.800]  Oh, what do, oh, CNN, here, let me, maybe Brian Stelter will tell me here, oh, the flaws,
[01:52:49.800 --> 01:52:50.800]  the flaws.
[01:52:50.800 --> 01:52:56.760]  I got to walk up, somebody walks up and shoots you in the head with a 45, oh, it's a flaw.
[01:52:56.760 --> 01:52:58.160]  No, it's done by design.
[01:52:58.160 --> 01:53:02.280]  The flaws could allow an attacker, oh, like the globalist, to read sensitive data stored
[01:53:02.280 --> 01:53:07.080]  in the memory, like passwords, or look at the tabs someone has opened on their computer,
[01:53:07.080 --> 01:53:08.080]  researchers found.
[01:53:08.080 --> 01:53:12.160]  Daniel Gruss, a researcher from Graz University of Technology, who helped identify the flaws
[01:53:12.160 --> 01:53:16.440]  that it may be difficult to execute an attack, but billions of devices are impacted.
[01:53:16.440 --> 01:53:17.680]  Oh, it may be difficult.
[01:53:17.680 --> 01:53:19.600]  Sure, right.
[01:53:19.600 --> 01:53:22.040]  They do it to be mass exploited at once.
[01:53:22.040 --> 01:53:23.040]  That's in all the documents.
[01:53:23.040 --> 01:53:26.880]  We're going to go back to your phone calls ahead of our next guest joining us.
[01:53:26.880 --> 01:53:29.080]  I just thought you might want to know that.
[01:53:29.080 --> 01:53:32.320]  I mean, I know you already know that, and you're saying, well, I know that I, I'm doing
[01:53:32.320 --> 01:53:33.320]  nothing wrong.
[01:53:33.320 --> 01:53:39.680]  Yeah, I had to get rid of four or five cell phones over the last three, four years, because
[01:53:39.680 --> 01:53:46.000]  someone would get in on it and start dialing people in the huge address book.
[01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:55.240]  Or I would go into my photos and there would be a video of my phone when it was sitting
[01:53:55.240 --> 01:53:56.240]  on the dresser.
[01:53:56.240 --> 01:54:12.920]  There'd be a eight hour video with me snoring in the background and stuff like that.
[01:54:12.920 --> 01:54:18.360]  My phones will turn on by themselves and dial my ex-wife.
[01:54:18.360 --> 01:54:23.600]  If I'm sitting down talking to my son about discipline or something, the phone turns
[01:54:23.600 --> 01:54:25.400]  on and dials.
[01:54:25.400 --> 01:54:32.160]  Little friends are there always listening, little friends.
[01:54:32.160 --> 01:54:38.760]  Just remember this window that you think so cool into the world is a window for them to
[01:54:38.760 --> 01:54:39.760]  reach through.
[01:54:39.760 --> 01:54:41.120]  I'm not saying my ex-wife's doing anything.
[01:54:41.120 --> 01:54:44.160]  I'm saying that's what's happened.
[01:54:44.160 --> 01:54:52.000]  It happened to Pat Riley, one of my crew members, while he was driving with my son,
[01:54:52.000 --> 01:54:58.360]  having a talk with him about life.
[01:54:58.360 --> 01:55:01.280]  That's the type of crap I deal with.
[01:55:01.280 --> 01:55:04.960]  And none of it's even bad that's going on, because you imagine the thousands of hours
[01:55:04.960 --> 01:55:09.960]  they've recorded of me, because that's the next big phase they're admitting is going
[01:55:09.960 --> 01:55:14.920]  to be, you can just take 10 minutes of somebody, two minutes, 30 seconds, and totally copy
[01:55:14.920 --> 01:55:18.680]  them with Adobe software that, remember, they brought out and then they pulled back because
[01:55:18.680 --> 01:55:20.800]  they went, whoa, this will hurt us too.
[01:55:20.800 --> 01:55:21.800]  That's 30-year-old technology.
[01:55:21.800 --> 01:55:27.320]  It just took more computing power back then, took longer.
[01:55:27.320 --> 01:55:29.040]  But this is how we're being exploited.
[01:55:29.040 --> 01:55:30.320]  This is how we're being targeted.
[01:55:30.320 --> 01:55:31.560]  This is how we're being manipulated.
[01:55:31.560 --> 01:55:32.560]  This is how you are.
[01:55:32.560 --> 01:55:35.680]  And so you think, well, you have nothing to hide.
[01:55:35.680 --> 01:55:39.920]  That's why people, they're going to Cancun for Christmas or wherever, they're going
[01:55:39.920 --> 01:55:40.920]  to London.
[01:55:40.920 --> 01:55:43.960]  Here's all the presents I've got under the tree that we're going to open when we get
[01:55:43.960 --> 01:55:44.960]  back.
[01:55:44.960 --> 01:55:45.960]  I gave my husband this, I gave him that.
[01:55:45.960 --> 01:55:48.680]  And then they know the day you leave, they rob you.
[01:55:48.680 --> 01:55:56.480]  See, you didn't do anything bad, but bad people used information on you to hurt you.
[01:55:56.480 --> 01:55:57.680]  And I'm not talking down to the audience.
[01:55:57.680 --> 01:56:00.880]  I know you get this, but other people go, oh, I don't care, let them spy on me.
[01:56:00.880 --> 01:56:01.880]  Oh, really?
[01:56:01.880 --> 01:56:03.880]  Let them spy on you, huh?
[01:56:03.880 --> 01:56:06.480]  What?
[01:56:06.480 --> 01:56:13.840]  And then I noticed years ago, it was always dialing Arab guest I'd had on, or Muslim guest,
[01:56:13.840 --> 01:56:17.720]  or other investigative journalist, I know what it was for.
[01:56:17.720 --> 01:56:22.800]  So they could then claim, we need a warrant on Jones for a, for how to do a parallel construction.
[01:56:22.800 --> 01:56:29.040]  And he can't find anything on him, but we're going to go ahead and get into his phone and
[01:56:29.040 --> 01:56:33.520]  have him dial some people that we already have got sizes on so we can pick him up the
[01:56:33.520 --> 01:56:35.240]  net.
[01:56:35.240 --> 01:56:37.920]  And they don't even do that until they're wanting to try to cook something up.
[01:56:37.920 --> 01:56:38.920]  They're already listening.
[01:56:38.920 --> 01:56:40.120]  They're already tracking.
[01:56:40.120 --> 01:56:42.600]  It's just that they have to open up an investigation.
[01:56:42.600 --> 01:56:46.880]  So they just get in my phone and start ring, ring, ring, ring, calling Abdul, calling, you
[01:56:46.880 --> 01:56:51.520]  know, calling this, calling that.
[01:56:51.520 --> 01:56:55.480]  And then I found out from intelligence sources that are very accurate that they were looking
[01:56:55.480 --> 01:56:57.040]  because I was against the Iraq war and all that.
[01:56:57.040 --> 01:56:58.040]  I wasn't pro-Islam.
[01:56:58.040 --> 01:57:06.320]  But I saw it was to put an even worse elements that they were looking to try to set me up.
[01:57:06.320 --> 01:57:09.960]  I guess like the show Homeland or something where I'm an Islamic terrorist.
[01:57:09.960 --> 01:57:14.520]  And I know that sounds insane, but that's actually how crazy they are.
[01:57:14.520 --> 01:57:16.760]  And look, the new show Homeland is about me.
[01:57:16.760 --> 01:57:17.760]  It's all about me.
[01:57:17.760 --> 01:57:22.400]  They got what eight shows that air either daily or weekly about me misrepresenting who
[01:57:22.400 --> 01:57:23.400]  I am.
[01:57:23.400 --> 01:57:24.400]  See why?
[01:57:24.400 --> 01:57:25.400]  Because they know I'm a good man.
[01:57:25.400 --> 01:57:28.280]  That doesn't mean I'm perfect and they want to destroy me.
[01:57:28.280 --> 01:57:30.560]  I need your prayers and I need your support.

[01:58:54.120 --> 01:59:00.480]  For those who want to increase testosterone and energy levels, most men know that testosterone
[01:59:00.480 --> 01:59:06.920]  levels begin to decline starting around 30 at a rate of about 1 to 2 percent per year.

[02:00:12.640 --> 02:00:13.640]  Alex Jones.
[02:00:13.640 --> 02:00:21.040]  We're going back to your phone calls and we've got Zach, the amazing source, joining
[02:00:21.040 --> 02:00:26.760]  us with Key Intel straight ahead as a guest and the Millie Weaver's coming up.
[02:00:26.760 --> 02:00:27.760]  I got a rule.
[02:00:27.760 --> 02:00:28.760]  I make callers hold for an hour.
[02:00:28.760 --> 02:00:30.640]  I give them all a free t-shirt of their choice.
[02:00:30.640 --> 02:00:31.640]  So everybody on hold.
[02:00:31.640 --> 02:00:32.640]  I don't care if they're in Mexico.
[02:00:32.640 --> 02:00:33.640]  I don't care if they're in New Jersey.
[02:00:33.640 --> 02:00:34.640]  I don't care where they are.
[02:00:34.640 --> 02:00:38.760]  They all get a free shirt.
[02:00:38.760 --> 02:00:39.760]  So let's just get their names or numbers.
[02:00:39.760 --> 02:00:42.400]  I know it's a huge hassle, but I'm just going to do it.
[02:00:42.400 --> 02:00:43.400]  Everybody holding.
[02:00:43.400 --> 02:00:45.680]  I'm going to get to a lot of you or all of you, but I want to go with Sam in Mexico.
[02:00:45.680 --> 02:00:50.000]  But Nico just ran in and he goes, yeah, you see this article about Google Home and Amazon's
[02:00:50.000 --> 02:00:52.000]  Alexa and all this.
[02:00:52.000 --> 02:00:57.800]  They admit in Consumer Watchdog and Consumer Reports, you name it, that they're watching
[02:00:57.800 --> 02:01:03.440]  and listening to you and that they're selling the data and that it has a mischief function.
[02:01:03.440 --> 02:01:07.960]  So it will spy on your kids in the house and listen to what they're saying and what they're
[02:01:07.960 --> 02:01:08.960]  doing.
[02:01:08.960 --> 02:01:13.040]  And then at the end of the motive, you have a robot hooked into a corporation that's totally
[02:01:13.040 --> 02:01:14.960]  evil watching your kids.
[02:01:14.960 --> 02:01:18.680]  I mean, if you had a bodyguard that was in your house, you'd want to trust them or like
[02:01:18.680 --> 02:01:19.680]  them.
[02:01:19.680 --> 02:01:20.680]  But still, it's weird.
[02:01:20.680 --> 02:01:21.680]  Okay.
[02:01:21.680 --> 02:01:24.240]  It's just as a privacy issue.
[02:01:24.240 --> 02:01:30.480]  This is a robot in your house and they're basically giving them away now because they're getting
[02:01:30.480 --> 02:01:31.480]  data on you.
[02:01:31.480 --> 02:01:35.360]  And I told you this in 2006 because they started doing it then.
[02:01:35.360 --> 02:01:42.720]  He wrote articles and I still tune in to local AM or local FM randomly.
[02:01:42.720 --> 02:01:48.120]  And half the time, if I listen 10 minutes, they're attacking me because it's people
[02:01:48.120 --> 02:01:49.120]  are paid to do this.
[02:01:49.120 --> 02:01:50.720]  And they go, he's the crazy one.
[02:01:50.720 --> 02:01:52.200]  Chang, our appliances are watching us.
[02:01:52.200 --> 02:01:57.400]  I had my cousin that I've known since I was one years old over for Thanksgiving.
[02:01:57.400 --> 02:01:58.400]  He's a nice guy.
[02:01:58.400 --> 02:01:59.400]  Or it was after Thanksgiving.
[02:01:59.400 --> 02:02:00.400]  It was early Christmas party.
[02:02:00.400 --> 02:02:03.480]  And he made a joke to me and, you know, say, yeah, my brother thinks, you know, the Alexa
[02:02:03.480 --> 02:02:06.440]  is listening, you know, like you do, and it was kind of like, he wanted to be like, argue
[02:02:06.440 --> 02:02:07.440]  with him.
[02:02:07.440 --> 02:02:08.440]  I was like, okay, whatever.
[02:02:08.440 --> 02:02:12.760]  It's just like, it's like, I'm not good for being right and being first to warn you.
[02:02:12.760 --> 02:02:15.200]  I'm bad.
[02:02:15.200 --> 02:02:18.040]  As everything I say comes true because it was already happening.
[02:02:18.040 --> 02:02:20.880]  It didn't come through that it was true.
[02:02:20.880 --> 02:02:23.200]  I'm worse, you see.
[02:02:23.200 --> 02:02:24.200]  I'm worse.
[02:02:24.200 --> 02:02:27.400]  And see, that's why they got to demonize me and attack me.
[02:02:27.400 --> 02:02:30.120]  So people go, I don't want to be that guy.
[02:02:30.120 --> 02:02:31.120]  I don't want to be.
[02:02:31.120 --> 02:02:35.040]  The message is, we're going to call you a white supremacist if you say you don't want
[02:02:35.040 --> 02:02:38.080]  to be spied on in your house by a robot.
[02:02:38.080 --> 02:02:43.320]  And if you sell a book about little bunny rabbits and Trump being sweet, we're going
[02:02:43.320 --> 02:02:44.320]  to say it's a white supremacist.
[02:02:44.320 --> 02:02:45.800]  They actually said that today.
[02:02:45.800 --> 02:02:50.640]  So I'm just saying, this is the magnitude of the enemy.
[02:02:50.640 --> 02:02:54.760]  This is the magnitude.
[02:02:54.760 --> 02:02:58.320]  And the good thing is so what?
[02:02:58.320 --> 02:03:03.520]  Should not be this people's slaves, they throw coffee on me or yell at me 95% of the time
[02:03:03.520 --> 02:03:07.880]  that somebody buys my dinner or pats me on the back and they have such a soul in their
[02:03:07.880 --> 02:03:08.880]  eyes.
[02:03:08.880 --> 02:03:10.960]  Black, white, Hispanic, Asian, old, young.
[02:03:10.960 --> 02:03:16.200]  Our listeners have always such incredible souls and are such beautiful people.
[02:03:16.200 --> 02:03:18.960]  Even if they're crippled or they're old or they look like a supermodel, they just have
[02:03:18.960 --> 02:03:20.840]  a look, Christy in their eyes.
[02:03:20.840 --> 02:03:27.400]  And then I see the servants of evil and they're so hateful and they hate me so much.
[02:03:27.400 --> 02:03:33.640]  And they're just pathetic and they want to destroy everything.
[02:03:33.640 --> 02:03:36.760]  And our forebears had to fight and die to have a little bit of freedom.
[02:03:36.760 --> 02:03:40.160]  All I got to do is just stand against them and let them demonize and attack and move
[02:03:40.160 --> 02:03:41.160]  forward.
[02:03:41.160 --> 02:03:42.160]  But see, they're not targeting me.
[02:03:42.160 --> 02:03:43.160]  They're targeting you.
[02:03:43.160 --> 02:03:47.600]  They know that I'm going on to the end, whatever the cost is, but they want the message to
[02:03:47.600 --> 02:03:50.600]  you that will get you if you stick your little head up.
[02:03:50.600 --> 02:03:53.040]  I'm sorry to Sam in Mexico, but I'm going to go to you quick here.
[02:03:53.040 --> 02:03:54.040]  So thanks for holding.
[02:03:54.040 --> 02:03:55.040]  Go ahead, Sam.
[02:03:55.040 --> 02:03:56.040]  You're on the air.
[02:03:56.040 --> 02:04:00.560]  I'm praying for you, Alex, and for president Trump in the infill war.
[02:04:00.560 --> 02:04:01.560]  Well, thank you.
[02:04:01.560 --> 02:04:02.880]  I need it, brother.
[02:04:02.880 --> 02:04:04.880]  What's on your mind?
[02:04:04.880 --> 02:04:09.520]  What we're up against is the fourth and terrible beast that the Bible talks about in Daniel
[02:04:09.520 --> 02:04:11.800]  and other places.
[02:04:11.800 --> 02:04:16.520]  This is the global government that you've been talking about for a long, long time.
[02:04:16.520 --> 02:04:19.880]  And now it's finally reared its ugly head.
[02:04:19.880 --> 02:04:23.440]  And that's the point.
[02:04:23.440 --> 02:04:26.720]  It's coming to pass, just like the Bible said.
[02:04:26.720 --> 02:04:27.720]  I'm going to come back to you.
[02:04:27.720 --> 02:04:30.400]  If you want to hold, this is important, because I know I've pontificated.
[02:04:30.400 --> 02:04:34.360]  We've got Zach coming up, he's a very, very important guest that I will get to everybody
[02:04:34.360 --> 02:04:35.360]  and Millie Weaver, I promise.
[02:04:35.360 --> 02:04:40.600]  But everybody gets a free t-shirt or a bottle of X2 or just tell us what you want, because
[02:04:40.600 --> 02:04:43.800]  I appreciate you holding for an hour, and I've got to break myself with this bad habit.
[02:04:43.800 --> 02:04:44.800]  We'll be right back.
[02:04:44.800 --> 02:04:45.800]  Stay with us.
[02:04:45.800 --> 02:04:56.560]  This is the end of this weekend by The Waste of Our Life in Fort Shore.com.
[02:04:56.560 --> 02:04:58.440]  Mike in Arizona here on the air worldwide.
[02:04:58.440 --> 02:04:59.440]  Go ahead.
[02:04:59.440 --> 02:05:01.600]  Oh, Alex, you can rent any day of the week.
[02:05:01.600 --> 02:05:05.400]  Thank you, sir, for doing what you do and being a patriot and doing your best to save
[02:05:05.400 --> 02:05:12.200]  America and encouraging us as fellow patriots to do that in our local areas as well.
[02:05:12.200 --> 02:05:17.640]  And as a long-time InfoWars listener, I want to say thanks for the awesome brain force,
[02:05:17.640 --> 02:05:18.640]  Anthroplex.
[02:05:18.640 --> 02:05:20.880]  My girlfriend would like to say thanks for the Anthroplex too.
[02:05:20.880 --> 02:05:21.880]  Thank you.
[02:05:21.880 --> 02:05:25.960]  I use the Biotru Selenium, the Super Blue toothpaste for you folks who aren't big, normal
[02:05:25.960 --> 02:05:26.960]  toothpaste fans.
[02:05:26.960 --> 02:05:31.720]  The Super Blue is awesome, and thank you so much, Alex, for the InfoWars Life products.
[02:05:31.720 --> 02:05:32.920]  They are quality.
[02:05:32.920 --> 02:05:37.560]  I can't wait to get some more, and thank you so much for doing that for us to keep us healthy.
[02:05:37.560 --> 02:05:38.560]  Absolutely.
[02:05:38.560 --> 02:05:43.880]  And because then we could all, as educated patriots, help our other countrymen and women
[02:05:43.880 --> 02:05:48.800]  understand that there's bigger problems going on, and if we can get our houses in order
[02:05:48.800 --> 02:06:09.240]  and be good to each other and ourselves, we can take our country back.
[02:06:09.240 --> 02:06:13.920]  Waging war on corruption, it's Alex Jones.
[02:06:13.920 --> 02:06:19.520]  All right, the gentleman we have on is anonymous, but he's not anonymous to us.
[02:06:19.520 --> 02:06:20.520]  We know his full name.
[02:06:20.520 --> 02:06:21.520]  We know who he is.
[02:06:21.520 --> 02:06:22.520]  We've confirmed it.
[02:06:22.520 --> 02:06:28.440]  And he's been on national news before as an individual with the U.S. military in some
[02:06:28.440 --> 02:06:32.840]  of the most secretive areas of counterterrorism, and we'll just leave it at that.
[02:06:32.840 --> 02:06:34.860]  And of course, he's formerly out of Florida.
[02:06:34.860 --> 02:06:41.680]  He has left and gone to Morocco, where he believes he can give us more information.
[02:06:41.680 --> 02:06:46.160]  And again, he gave us devastating info that they didn't even touch in the media on Vegas
[02:06:46.160 --> 02:06:50.040]  and exactly the intel we should look at on what really happened there, and now they admit
[02:06:50.040 --> 02:06:51.040]  they're lying about what happened.
[02:06:51.040 --> 02:06:52.800]  That's why they just went away.
[02:06:52.800 --> 02:06:55.400]  They stopped using that against the guns real quick.
[02:06:55.400 --> 02:06:59.400]  And a lot of other information, he's been brought in by the FBI, visited once, brought
[02:06:59.400 --> 02:07:04.240]  in by the FBI the second time, brought into the Army, and he's not giving us anything
[02:07:04.240 --> 02:07:05.680]  classified here.
[02:07:05.680 --> 02:07:10.880]  As a citizen, he's pointing out things that are hiding in plain view that people not trained
[02:07:10.880 --> 02:07:13.280]  for it won't see.
[02:07:13.280 --> 02:07:15.440]  And so we want to get him on.
[02:07:15.440 --> 02:07:16.560]  He hasn't been ready to.
[02:07:16.560 --> 02:07:21.920]  Obviously, his lawyers, I guess, have given him the green light, so we're going to break
[02:07:21.920 --> 02:07:24.320]  down some very, very important things here on air.
[02:07:24.320 --> 02:07:29.960]  And it's why the globalists hate live, unfiltered broadcasts like this, because other people
[02:07:29.960 --> 02:07:30.960]  don't do this.
[02:07:30.960 --> 02:07:32.760]  And I don't say that they go, oh, look, we're big and bad.
[02:07:32.760 --> 02:07:37.080]  I'm just telling you, folks, that somebody can anonymously put something out there on
[02:07:37.080 --> 02:07:38.080]  the Internet.
[02:07:38.080 --> 02:07:41.840]  It's a manna, manna from, you know, Jesus, and sometimes it's disinformation.
[02:07:41.840 --> 02:07:46.920]  Zach is who he says he is and has been in very, very important areas of this, this whole
[02:07:46.920 --> 02:07:51.240]  thing to be able to give us the information he gives us and is doing this at a risk to
[02:07:51.240 --> 02:07:58.000]  himself because there's kind of mafia rules to this, at least on the West, that if you're
[02:07:58.000 --> 02:08:04.400]  a real journalist and keep your nose clean, they, they, they still don't kill you.
[02:08:04.400 --> 02:08:08.800]  But if you've worked in the system, then they think they own you and they kill you.
[02:08:08.800 --> 02:08:13.720]  Now there's a lot of good people in our government, and there's an internal civil war going on
[02:08:13.720 --> 02:08:17.000]  for the heart and soul of the country, and it's spilt out of the open now, okay?
[02:08:17.000 --> 02:08:18.240]  So Zach, we appreciate your courage.
[02:08:18.240 --> 02:08:19.880]  We appreciate you joining us.
[02:08:19.880 --> 02:08:20.880]  Last time you were on, you were in Morocco.
[02:08:20.880 --> 02:08:21.880]  Are you still in Morocco?
[02:08:21.880 --> 02:08:26.880]  As of yesterday, first and foremost, Alex, it's a pleasure to be back on with you, how
[02:08:26.880 --> 02:08:28.880]  to come on and connect some dots.
[02:08:28.880 --> 02:08:36.040]  As of yesterday, I'm blown out of Casablanca, I'm actively, right now, east of Orlando
[02:08:36.040 --> 02:08:40.040]  in a route to Cape Canaveral to bring up my first point, which is part of four that are
[02:08:40.040 --> 02:08:43.840]  critical information that we will discuss here.
[02:08:43.840 --> 02:08:48.160]  Okay, well, go ahead, your phone's breaking up a little bit, but go ahead.
[02:08:48.160 --> 02:08:50.200]  Okay, can you hear me loud and clear now?
[02:08:50.200 --> 02:08:51.200]  Yes, I can.
[02:08:51.200 --> 02:08:52.200]  Go ahead.
[02:08:52.200 --> 02:08:53.200]  Okay.
[02:08:53.200 --> 02:08:57.680]  First, first and most importantly, I had to get in touch with Niko about the North
[02:08:57.680 --> 02:09:02.600]  Korea information, because what's going on in Cape Canaveral this weekend, and I hope
[02:09:02.600 --> 02:09:06.320]  your researchers can kind of, in real time, pick this stuff up with Niko that's out there
[02:09:06.320 --> 02:09:07.320]  right now.
[02:09:07.320 --> 02:09:14.920]  This is Area 59, SpaceX is having a launch this weekend, whether it was supposed to happen
[02:09:14.920 --> 02:09:18.920]  yesterday, but because of whether it's going to happen this weekend, it's the SpaceX Falcon
[02:09:18.920 --> 02:09:25.520]  9 with this secret payload Zuma, and that's going to go into orbit, and that is done by
[02:09:25.520 --> 02:09:31.440]  SpaceX, but the payload is in conjunction with the U.S. Air Force, that the DOD fulfilled
[02:09:31.440 --> 02:09:32.440]  contract.
[02:09:32.440 --> 02:09:35.160]  Now, you're not setting a secret yet, but I want you to be careful here, okay?
[02:09:35.160 --> 02:09:40.560]  No, no, no, no, no, no, this is public, it's just people aren't connecting the dots or
[02:09:40.560 --> 02:09:41.560]  getting the breadcrumbs yet.
[02:09:41.560 --> 02:09:44.480]  I mean, you could Google that and find that.
[02:09:44.480 --> 02:09:50.160]  But obviously, North Korea knows, and notice they're suddenly calling for the first time
[02:09:50.160 --> 02:09:54.240]  in decades, and having March is now calling for peace, isn't that funny?
[02:09:54.240 --> 02:09:59.840]  Well, okay, so, okay, I got four major points here, and I got to get to them all because
[02:09:59.840 --> 02:10:00.840]  they're all interconnected.
[02:10:00.840 --> 02:10:01.840]  That's right.
[02:10:01.840 --> 02:10:08.960]  The SpaceX launch, the Falcon 9 with the Zuma, that's the UMA payload, that's U.S. Air Force
[02:10:08.960 --> 02:10:12.960]  that's going to be done with what they're calling Area 59, that's not conspiratorial,
[02:10:12.960 --> 02:10:18.240]  that's official, that's outside of Cape Canaveral there, and that's Elon Musk fulfilling the
[02:10:18.240 --> 02:10:24.240]  DOD contract, which he's done plenty of all of a sudden, which ties into the spectrum
[02:10:24.240 --> 02:10:25.240]  bug.
[02:10:25.240 --> 02:10:28.400]  You were looting to it a couple minutes ago that I was listening.
[02:10:28.400 --> 02:10:32.480]  That is the back doors into the microprocessors of everything.
[02:10:32.480 --> 02:10:34.280]  Okay, here's the deal.
[02:10:34.280 --> 02:10:38.320]  The Silicon Valley sultans have fallen, have fell in line because they saw what happened
[02:10:38.320 --> 02:10:40.120]  to Schmidt, and they're not untouchable.
[02:10:40.120 --> 02:10:45.520]  Elon Musk has picked his side, he's in with the DOD, but we have collected a lot of information.
[02:10:45.520 --> 02:10:48.200]  I shouldn't say we have collected a lot of information.
[02:10:48.200 --> 02:10:53.000]  There's a lot of information being collected, PDFs, it's been mirrored, it's been copied.
[02:10:53.000 --> 02:10:57.840]  Class action lawsuits have been filed because of the spectrum bug in California, Oregon,
[02:10:57.840 --> 02:11:01.360]  and most importantly, and weirdly, Indiana.
[02:11:01.360 --> 02:11:02.360]  Why Indiana?
[02:11:02.360 --> 02:11:04.880]  Well, I could tell you why Indiana.
[02:11:04.880 --> 02:11:08.840]  There's some troubling emails between Mike Pence, Stephen Bannon, and we could get in
[02:11:08.840 --> 02:11:13.040]  two miles quack and how that all works out, and I got a couple more points here.
[02:11:13.040 --> 02:11:15.760]  I'm sorry if I'm jumping, but this stuff's pretty quick.
[02:11:15.760 --> 02:11:16.760]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:11:16.760 --> 02:11:17.760]  Continue.
[02:11:17.760 --> 02:11:18.760]  Okay.
[02:11:18.760 --> 02:11:29.520]  So, the spectrum bug could be read as spying on everyday Americans and make no mistake
[02:11:29.520 --> 02:11:32.520]  whether you're a public official at the highest levels of power.
[02:11:32.520 --> 02:11:36.920]  If you're a congressman, a senator, if you happen to be a secretary of state, if you
[02:11:36.920 --> 02:11:41.760]  happen to be whatever you are, make no mistake, you use those same devices, so if you think
[02:11:41.760 --> 02:11:45.480]  you could bleach him, if you think you could have a house fire and play victim and get
[02:11:45.480 --> 02:11:50.880]  rid of them, you are highly mistaken because the Silicon Valley sultans put the spectrum
[02:11:50.880 --> 02:11:51.880]  bug out there.
[02:11:51.880 --> 02:11:52.880]  It's classified.
[02:11:52.880 --> 02:11:56.120]  Nobody's going to know who dropped it, but the information's out there, and now we have
[02:11:56.120 --> 02:11:57.120]  the information.
[02:11:57.120 --> 02:12:03.160]  Now we have the PDFs, which will be released, our sergeant will be released.
[02:12:03.160 --> 02:12:08.040]  Bannon made a big, big, big mistake.
[02:12:08.040 --> 02:12:10.080]  Here's the problem with Bannon.
[02:12:10.080 --> 02:12:12.840]  Bannon tried to align with Miles Kwok.
[02:12:12.840 --> 02:12:16.760]  Miles Kwok, people probably don't know who he is, but the Chinese billionaire who should
[02:12:16.760 --> 02:12:22.560]  be in China, he is the world, he is the main piece when it comes to this North Korea strike.
[02:12:22.560 --> 02:12:27.360]  This Zuma payload that's going to be fulfilled by SpaceX, which launches those frigate in
[02:12:27.360 --> 02:12:32.000]  the orbit, is going to do something for DOD that I can't get into that will make the
[02:12:32.000 --> 02:12:37.000]  North Korea act plausible and not as catastrophic as people are worried about.
[02:12:37.000 --> 02:12:40.080]  Also, it's going to give us the green light with China.
[02:12:40.080 --> 02:12:43.360]  We're going to give them Miles Kwok, and we are going to get the green light to take out
[02:12:43.360 --> 02:12:46.800]  North Korea as me, and you talked about many months ago.
[02:12:46.800 --> 02:12:51.080]  Bannon and some weird, I don't know what happened.
[02:12:51.080 --> 02:12:55.240]  I think I do know what happened because I've seen some emails in PDF.
[02:12:55.240 --> 02:12:59.680]  They were attempting to pull off the 25th against 45.
[02:12:59.680 --> 02:13:05.920]  Obviously that didn't happen, and they thought they were killing with an idiot.
[02:13:05.920 --> 02:13:06.920]  This is serious.
[02:13:06.920 --> 02:13:07.920]  This is happening right now.
[02:13:07.920 --> 02:13:08.920]  This is happening right now.
[02:13:08.920 --> 02:13:13.360]  Well, I know Roger Stone is much more than he seems, obviously, and he's been down at
[02:13:13.360 --> 02:13:14.360]  Mar-a-Lago.
[02:13:14.360 --> 02:13:18.080]  I'm going to leave it at that, and six months ago, eight months ago, I was like, shut up
[02:13:18.080 --> 02:13:19.080]  about Kwok.
[02:13:19.080 --> 02:13:20.080]  Kwok.
[02:13:20.080 --> 02:13:21.080]  Kwok.
[02:13:21.080 --> 02:13:22.080]  Kwok.
[02:13:22.080 --> 02:13:23.080]  Kwok.
[02:13:23.080 --> 02:13:24.080]  Kwok.
[02:13:24.080 --> 02:13:25.080]  Kwok.
[02:13:25.080 --> 02:13:26.080]  Kwok.
[02:13:26.080 --> 02:13:27.080]  Kwok.
[02:13:27.080 --> 02:13:28.080]  Kwok.
[02:13:28.080 --> 02:13:29.080]  Kwok.
[02:13:29.080 --> 02:13:30.080]  Kwok.
[02:13:30.080 --> 02:13:31.080]  Kwok.
[02:13:31.080 --> 02:13:32.080]  Kwok.
[02:13:32.080 --> 02:13:33.080]  Kwok.
[02:13:33.080 --> 02:13:34.080]  Kwok.
[02:13:34.080 --> 02:13:35.080]  Kwok.
[02:13:35.080 --> 02:13:36.080]  Good.
[02:13:36.080 --> 02:13:39.200]  And the president is so busy, he's like literally, what?
[02:13:39.200 --> 02:13:40.660]  That guy hadn't been yet?
[02:13:40.660 --> 02:13:42.780]  I mean, it's just, it's crazy.
[02:13:42.780 --> 02:13:45.800]  Well, the issue was that they were double dealing.
[02:13:45.800 --> 02:13:46.640]  Bannon and Tillerson.
[02:13:46.640 --> 02:13:48.900]  Tillerson is the next, what they don't understand is-
[02:13:48.900 --> 02:13:53.820]  Well, that's what—okay, I'll just say it, Stone told me that Bannon was going to be out
[02:13:53.820 --> 02:13:59.540]  six months ago because of intelligence operations getting caught up by the Chinese.
[02:13:59.540 --> 02:14:03.720]  And it was basically four bays from talking about it, but now it's basically out.
[02:14:03.720 --> 02:14:06.780]  And I was like, absolutely, I don't want to come out and take bannins in bed with the
[02:14:06.780 --> 02:14:07.780]  Chinese.
[02:14:07.780 --> 02:14:08.780]  Are you kidding?
[02:14:08.780 --> 02:14:10.280]  But that's the word.
[02:14:10.280 --> 02:14:13.580]  And I just sounded crazy to me and now look at this.
[02:14:13.580 --> 02:14:17.780]  So, so then, you know, you have Trump coming out and I can't get into certain things that
[02:14:17.780 --> 02:14:20.540]  are going on, but yeah, there are operations protecting this.
[02:14:20.540 --> 02:14:24.780]  Yeah, this guy is running around shooting his mouth about China.
[02:14:24.780 --> 02:14:26.580]  That's the biggest Trojan horse I've ever seen.
[02:14:26.580 --> 02:14:29.180]  You can take one look at that guy.
[02:14:29.180 --> 02:14:30.180]  Sorry.
[02:14:30.180 --> 02:14:34.380]  So, what could be said about the banning that hasn't already been said about Karl Rove
[02:14:34.380 --> 02:14:38.020]  and what could be said about Karl Rove that hasn't already been said about Bandar Bush
[02:14:38.020 --> 02:14:39.020]  Yuck?
[02:14:39.020 --> 02:14:45.460]  The Silicon Valley sultans had to fall in line and Elon Musk did because they saw what
[02:14:45.460 --> 02:14:49.980]  happened to the actual sultans in Saudi Arabia and as we spoke about months ago, the viewers
[02:14:49.980 --> 02:14:50.980]  could pick it up.
[02:14:50.980 --> 02:14:56.380]  I told everybody first year, salvage, second year, savage and what we're seeing right
[02:14:56.380 --> 02:15:01.260]  now is nothing short of remarkable and I'm just telling you right now, quack will be
[02:15:01.260 --> 02:15:06.780]  extradited and the sultans will be in the United States within about a week and that's
[02:15:06.780 --> 02:15:08.460]  going to be a switch that's going to happen.
[02:15:08.460 --> 02:15:10.820]  And you know, here's the last thing.
[02:15:10.820 --> 02:15:14.620]  So, I left Casablanca yesterday in Morocco, I had to go there for certain things, but
[02:15:14.620 --> 02:15:19.340]  Elon Musk is a patriot, a sultans is a patriot.
[02:15:19.340 --> 02:15:25.100]  There's, Elon Musk has a lot of interest in the Sahara and making huge solar farms as
[02:15:25.100 --> 02:15:30.500]  he does in Australia and I can tell you right now that Musk is a fan of yours.
[02:15:30.500 --> 02:15:34.660]  I could tell you in the same way, maybe didn't know who I was back then, but Farrakhan was
[02:15:34.660 --> 02:15:35.660]  a fan of yours.
[02:15:35.660 --> 02:15:39.100]  The problem is the image and they think, you know, all the, you know, I'll just say it
[02:15:39.100 --> 02:15:40.100]  now.
[02:15:40.100 --> 02:15:43.620]  It wasn't off the record, but I just, I can't even get into it.
[02:15:43.620 --> 02:15:44.620]  I mean, that's incredible.
[02:15:44.620 --> 02:15:45.620]  Hold on.
[02:15:45.620 --> 02:15:46.620]  Hold on.
[02:15:46.620 --> 02:15:47.620]  Stay right there.
[02:15:47.620 --> 02:15:56.100]  Let me ride back on the other side with our real Q and A. Stay with us.
[02:15:56.100 --> 02:16:00.620]  Heart disease is on the rise, clogged arteries, high blood pressure and high cholesterol
[02:16:00.620 --> 02:16:04.900]  levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[02:16:04.900 --> 02:16:09.740]  Loss of energy, blood sugar, spikes and drops, poor circulation and irregular heartbeat are
[02:16:09.740 --> 02:16:13.300]  just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[02:16:13.300 --> 02:16:17.820]  Remember how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives
[02:16:17.820 --> 02:16:18.820]  across America.
[02:16:18.820 --> 02:16:22.700]  My blood pressure has normalized, my diabetes has totally improved.
[02:16:22.700 --> 02:16:26.380]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much
[02:16:26.380 --> 02:16:27.380]  healthier I feel.
[02:16:27.380 --> 02:16:30.020]  I recommend heart and body extract to everyone.
[02:16:30.020 --> 02:16:35.220]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative
[02:16:35.220 --> 02:16:37.700]  to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[02:16:37.700 --> 02:16:45.900]  Remember your two month supply today by calling 866-295-5305 that's 866-295-5305 or order
[02:16:45.900 --> 02:16:55.060]  online hbextract.com, heart and body extract 866-295-5305 or hbextract.com.
[02:16:55.060 --> 02:17:00.420]  The answer to being in control of your own healthcare is freedom from insurance.
[02:17:00.420 --> 02:17:04.500]  Become part of a group of self-pay patients that come together to share in each other's
[02:17:04.500 --> 02:17:06.260]  medical expenses.
[02:17:06.260 --> 02:17:10.980]  People share amounts begin at $107 a month and $347 for families.
[02:17:10.980 --> 02:17:13.020]  Choose from three health sharing programs.
[02:17:13.020 --> 02:17:15.380]  Holistic treatments may be eligible for sharing.
[02:17:15.380 --> 02:17:16.380]  See guidelines.
[02:17:16.380 --> 02:17:19.620]  Discount programs available for dental, vision and pharmacy.
[02:17:19.620 --> 02:17:24.900]  Go to libertyoncall.org that's libertyoncall.org.
[02:17:24.900 --> 02:17:27.500]  Most people think life insurance pays after you're dead.
[02:17:27.500 --> 02:17:28.500]  That's true.
[02:17:28.500 --> 02:17:32.220]  But did you know you can have tax-free access to your life insurance while you're still
[02:17:32.220 --> 02:17:33.500]  alive?
[02:17:33.500 --> 02:17:37.100]  You can use the life benefits of your life insurance to grow your money with certainty
[02:17:37.100 --> 02:17:38.700]  and guarantees.
[02:17:38.700 --> 02:17:42.980]  No stock market risk, no tax risk and no penalties.
[02:17:42.980 --> 02:17:46.820]  Call life benefits if you'd like a free book about how this can be done.
[02:17:46.820 --> 02:17:56.780]  Call 702-660-7000 that's 702-660-7000.
[02:17:56.780 --> 02:18:03.380]  Top scientists and researchers agree we are being hit by toxic weapons in the food and
[02:18:03.380 --> 02:18:08.740]  water supply that are making us fat, sick and stupid.
[02:18:08.740 --> 02:18:10.140]  So what do we do about it?
[02:18:10.140 --> 02:18:13.540]  Well for starters, don't just sit there and take it.
[02:18:13.540 --> 02:18:20.500]  Fight back with the all new supercharged Brain Force Plus and feel the rust without the
[02:18:20.500 --> 02:18:21.500]  crash.

[02:18:27.420 --> 02:18:33.300]  And now we've added a brand new ingredient called black pepper fruit extract.
[02:18:33.300 --> 02:18:36.260]  It gives you an added kick.
[02:18:36.260 --> 02:18:42.580]  Other ingredients include vitamin B12 and neurological tonic and cognitive enhancers
[02:18:42.580 --> 02:18:48.940]  that will allow you to flip the switch and supercharge your state of mind.
[02:18:48.940 --> 02:18:50.420]  It's the real deal.
[02:18:50.420 --> 02:18:52.220]  Brain Force Plus.

[02:18:57.020 --> 02:19:01.180]  Brett Smith, author of Thump The First 100 Days.
[02:19:01.180 --> 02:19:04.700]  He explained to people about Thump and why this is an important book and how it ties
[02:19:04.700 --> 02:19:05.700]  into things.
[02:19:05.700 --> 02:19:07.980]  And I just thought to myself, you know, this is brilliant.
[02:19:07.980 --> 02:19:12.700]  This is the ultimate juxtaposition of what everyone says about the president.
[02:19:12.700 --> 02:19:17.580]  You know, they say that he's a racist, misogynist, sexist, bigoted, homophobic Nazi.
[02:19:17.580 --> 02:19:22.540]  So what better way to counter that than by turning him into an incredibly cute, lovable,
[02:19:22.540 --> 02:19:23.540]  fluffy little bunny.
[02:19:23.540 --> 02:19:26.220]  It's got that fun, rhyming structure to it.
[02:19:26.220 --> 02:19:27.220]  It's actually hilarious.
[02:19:27.220 --> 02:19:29.980]  I was cracking up reading the whole book, and I was cracking up.
[02:19:29.980 --> 02:19:31.220]  And it's a great book for adults.
[02:19:31.220 --> 02:19:32.660]  It's a great book for children.
[02:19:32.660 --> 02:19:33.900]  We're selling the book.
[02:19:33.900 --> 02:19:40.020]  We've got it bundled as well here with a one-off poster that's a collector's item.
[02:19:40.020 --> 02:19:44.780]  Both of these, the book, the graphic novel, and the poster are $29.95 that helps support
[02:19:44.780 --> 02:19:45.780]  us.
[02:19:45.780 --> 02:19:50.180]  So get the book Thump The First 100 Days and Alex Jones and Thump the Art of InfoWars
[02:19:50.180 --> 02:19:59.260]  for a limited edition at infowarstore.com.
[02:19:59.260 --> 02:20:06.260]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:20:06.260 --> 02:20:22.660]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[02:20:22.660 --> 02:20:24.380]  You want to stop tyranny?
[02:20:24.380 --> 02:20:25.940]  Well, so does he.
[02:20:25.940 --> 02:20:32.100]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:20:32.100 --> 02:20:33.100]  This isn't a game.
[02:20:33.100 --> 02:20:34.100]  It's not a drill.
[02:20:34.100 --> 02:20:35.100]  It's not make-believe.
[02:20:35.100 --> 02:20:36.100]  We're not larping here.
[02:20:36.100 --> 02:20:39.060]  This is not live action role-playing.
[02:20:39.060 --> 02:20:40.420]  This isn't fantasy land.
[02:20:40.420 --> 02:20:41.420]  This is the real world.
[02:20:41.420 --> 02:20:46.300]  And Zach is a real high-level intelligence source whose information has just continued
[02:20:46.300 --> 02:20:49.340]  to turn out to be stunningly good.
[02:20:49.340 --> 02:20:53.180]  And that's why the FBI has come and questioned him once and taken him to the military base
[02:20:53.180 --> 02:20:56.860]  the other time and held him and then released him.
[02:20:56.860 --> 02:21:02.340]  And I think it's important that people understand that people like Assange and people like Zach
[02:21:02.340 --> 02:21:06.900]  put themselves at great risk in just defense of basic human liberty.
[02:21:06.900 --> 02:21:12.260]  Meanwhile, Republicans asked DOJ for criminal probe of ex-British spy, Steele, who penned
[02:21:12.260 --> 02:21:15.860]  Trump dossier that's now admitted to be fake by Steele.
[02:21:15.860 --> 02:21:19.700]  And Grassley's also calling, basically, well, there's a new criminal investigation of Hillary.
[02:21:19.700 --> 02:21:21.220]  It's all happening.
[02:21:21.220 --> 02:21:22.500]  And Eric Schmidt had to leave.
[02:21:22.500 --> 02:21:27.340]  Let's get into other tidbits you haven't hit on and why Schmidt had to go and the big
[02:21:27.340 --> 02:21:31.020]  shake-up because they're still censoring.
[02:21:31.020 --> 02:21:35.140]  But the word is they've been told by the head of the FCC, publicly and privately, that
[02:21:35.140 --> 02:21:38.620]  they better stop or they're going to break up Google, Facebook, and Twitter.
[02:21:38.620 --> 02:21:41.860]  So a truly anonymous intelligence source.
[02:21:41.860 --> 02:21:43.660]  Zach, please continue now.
[02:21:43.660 --> 02:21:45.340]  Now back in the U.S. Go ahead.
[02:21:45.340 --> 02:21:46.340]  Yeah.
[02:21:46.340 --> 02:21:48.620]  So it's the specter bug.
[02:21:48.620 --> 02:21:54.340]  Like I said, we call him the convalescent, they figured it out, must kind of leap the
[02:21:54.340 --> 02:21:55.340]  way there.
[02:21:55.340 --> 02:21:57.980]  But we're not messing around here.
[02:21:57.980 --> 02:22:04.500]  And so let me just get into this one because I missed this point, I should have probably
[02:22:04.500 --> 02:22:05.500]  started with this.
[02:22:05.500 --> 02:22:10.380]  Huma Abedin, I don't know if you remember our call a couple of weeks ago, but we made
[02:22:10.380 --> 02:22:15.940]  the HRC, Huma, Huma-Obama connection there, make no mistake, Huma's going to be indicted,
[02:22:15.940 --> 02:22:22.100]  Huma's going to be prosecuted, sessions is doing some, first of all, sessions is compromised.
[02:22:22.100 --> 02:22:25.140]  Sessions is a very compromised coalition, is very compromised.
[02:22:25.140 --> 02:22:29.460]  And when the spectrum bug comes out, the PDF's come out, it's not going to come from an individual
[02:22:29.460 --> 02:22:33.100]  person, but that would just be published and then you're also going to be able to report
[02:22:33.100 --> 02:22:34.100]  them.
[02:22:34.100 --> 02:22:35.100]  So that is what it is.
[02:22:35.100 --> 02:22:38.860]  But with that being said, he understands the writings on the wall there and they got
[02:22:38.860 --> 02:22:44.020]  19 new prosecutors looking into all the field indictments and Huma's done what the problem
[02:22:44.020 --> 02:22:48.860]  is, the stuff, you know, Huma, Huma's the Awan brother connection and with the Awan
[02:22:48.860 --> 02:22:52.180]  brother connection, they're the damning emails, the spectrum bug.
[02:22:52.180 --> 02:22:53.180]  Sure.
[02:22:53.180 --> 02:22:59.140]  I don't want to interrupt you, but what about this fire in their bedroom, like basically
[02:22:59.140 --> 02:23:01.140]  a fireball in the end?
[02:23:01.140 --> 02:23:02.140]  Yeah.
[02:23:02.140 --> 02:23:03.140]  Go ahead.
[02:23:03.140 --> 02:23:04.140]  Yeah.
[02:23:04.140 --> 02:23:08.940]  Well, so that's a double barb and people will know what that means.
[02:23:08.940 --> 02:23:12.500]  They're not untouchable and a lot of people aren't happy with them.
[02:23:12.500 --> 02:23:18.140]  So something happened there, of course, I know nothing about that, but something did
[02:23:18.140 --> 02:23:24.820]  happen there and it was an attempt to burn or get rid or destroy certain evidence hardware
[02:23:24.820 --> 02:23:29.980]  and even hard files that they had and play some sort of weird game, but make no mistake.
[02:23:29.980 --> 02:23:36.500]  They had internal security that was like very tight there, but they were attacked.
[02:23:36.500 --> 02:23:41.820]  They were attacked and they were just left to know on Seth's birthday, Seth Rich's birthday,
[02:23:41.820 --> 02:23:42.820]  make no mistake.
[02:23:42.820 --> 02:23:43.820]  We're coming at you.
[02:23:43.820 --> 02:23:48.020]  You're coming at you hard and when it comes to Obama, and I'm sorry if I'm jumping, but
[02:23:48.020 --> 02:23:54.020]  when it comes to, because this is all connected, the HRC fire, she's done, Huma's done, Huma
[02:23:54.020 --> 02:23:56.020]  will be the end of HRC.
[02:23:56.020 --> 02:24:00.740]  That was a big problem for her, but we got the emails through spectrum, it's all done.
[02:24:00.740 --> 02:24:07.700]  But the Obama Foundation, this guy's all around the world doing this and this and that.
[02:24:07.700 --> 02:24:11.140]  The Obama Foundation's got a real problem, Barack Obama's got a real problem on his hand.
[02:24:11.140 --> 02:24:14.460]  We promised to close with Gitmo.
[02:24:14.460 --> 02:24:19.020]  It's kind of fitting and kind of poetic that he didn't close Gitmo, one of his promises
[02:24:19.020 --> 02:24:23.540]  that he didn't do and funny enough, depending on how you look at it, some of his closest
[02:24:23.540 --> 02:24:27.580]  allies are end up being there, hated or not.
[02:24:27.580 --> 02:24:28.740]  Amazing.
[02:24:28.740 --> 02:24:33.300]  Other big, other, other big points you'd like to make or just talking to your colleagues,
[02:24:33.300 --> 02:24:37.140]  just a general sense of where this battle to restore the Republic is right now.
[02:24:37.140 --> 02:24:38.140]  Yeah.
[02:24:38.140 --> 02:24:39.140]  Okay.
[02:24:39.140 --> 02:24:44.660]  We're getting into 2018 with Trump, Trump puts up a tweet and Trump, you know, they
[02:24:44.660 --> 02:24:49.060]  criticize him for Twitter and they criticize him for having some, I guess you could call
[02:24:49.060 --> 02:24:54.620]  them deep data left behind actors or whatever, but they criticize whatever's over the target.
[02:24:54.620 --> 02:24:57.060]  Well Trump, Trump, Trump tweets and this is out there.
[02:24:57.060 --> 02:24:59.020]  You know what makes a good movie?
[02:24:59.020 --> 02:25:00.020]  Good actors.
[02:25:00.020 --> 02:25:06.540]  He played Bannon, he played Tillerson, he's playing Haley, he's letting them, he's working
[02:25:06.540 --> 02:25:11.420]  in for what they were, it's not going to be that bad, but your political careers are over.
[02:25:11.420 --> 02:25:12.420]  And they're done.
[02:25:12.420 --> 02:25:17.780]  Bannon is a special case because he's especially crazy, like he's actually out of his mind
[02:25:17.780 --> 02:25:22.780]  and when you see the PDF, you know, the people he's talking about and you'd be surprised,
[02:25:22.780 --> 02:25:24.300]  you would be surprised who he's talking to.
[02:25:24.300 --> 02:25:28.500]  We know he's talking to Miles Kwok, but Miles Kwok, we have to understand, he wasn't even
[02:25:28.500 --> 02:25:35.060]  on the radar for a little bit, but Vice Media, okay, so Vice Media puts out a piece on this
[02:25:35.060 --> 02:25:38.740]  lecture by the Chinese billionaire, it's this puff piece of high, he's this great guy in
[02:25:38.740 --> 02:25:45.100]  China, so terrible and blah, blah, blah, and it's, and it shames Smith's advice of doing
[02:25:45.100 --> 02:25:46.100]  this.
[02:25:46.100 --> 02:25:50.340]  It's Shane Smith that has to sit down with Barack Obama and talking about his foundation.
[02:25:50.340 --> 02:25:52.340]  Sure, it's a key operative.
[02:25:52.340 --> 02:25:59.140]  Yeah, it's intense and I don't know if Gavin would talk about it, but just look at it.
[02:25:59.140 --> 02:26:04.300]  Is he, I mean, obviously he comes off to me as a straight up Chinese communist agent.
[02:26:04.300 --> 02:26:07.380]  I don't even think he's a double dealer like they're trying to sell on the media.
[02:26:07.380 --> 02:26:11.980]  Well, you know, I even admire individuals like Anthony Bourdain, like I like the show,
[02:26:11.980 --> 02:26:15.700]  it's an entertaining show, but when you talk about Hemlock and if you watch into some of
[02:26:15.700 --> 02:26:20.180]  the other episodes where he opens a season at Shanghai, it says, I think the new language
[02:26:20.180 --> 02:26:21.500]  of the world will be Mandarin.
[02:26:21.500 --> 02:26:24.740]  And it's like, what are you talking about and where does he work now?
[02:26:24.740 --> 02:26:30.140]  It's like he worked at CNN and I think- Sure, it's a sellout to China, the globalist bet
[02:26:30.140 --> 02:26:32.940]  everything on China, it's not going to be the Chinese century, it's going to be the
[02:26:32.940 --> 02:26:35.060]  new American century.
[02:26:35.060 --> 02:26:36.060]  It will.
[02:26:36.060 --> 02:26:40.180]  And okay, so this is another one and this is a big one and this is what's going to come
[02:26:40.180 --> 02:26:41.180]  out next week.
[02:26:41.180 --> 02:26:46.900]  So let's not lose sight of Ambassador Jack F. Matlock, Jr.
[02:26:46.900 --> 02:26:54.340]  Jack F. Matlock, Jr. was an ambassador to Russia back in the 70s when we were having
[02:26:54.340 --> 02:27:01.580]  this issue with the following USSR into becoming Russia and he speaks prophetically about how
[02:27:01.580 --> 02:27:07.180]  they will do what they are doing now and Trump has spoke about Matlock and meetings in some
[02:27:07.180 --> 02:27:14.580]  places and stuff like this, but let's not lose sight that the U.S., like the transition
[02:27:14.580 --> 02:27:20.660]  between the U.S.S.R. into what Russia is today is not like that long of a historical leap.
[02:27:20.660 --> 02:27:27.060]  So they're staying behind communists that are not so happy that the Soviet Union became
[02:27:27.060 --> 02:27:31.540]  Russia and if we could understand that a lot of this stuff starts to make sense, the problem
[02:27:31.540 --> 02:27:37.140]  is that we have a real president and they thought they were going to pull off the 25th
[02:27:37.140 --> 02:27:43.540]  on 45, but the only thing that resembles 25 is 25,000 and it's how Jones, so they are
[02:27:43.540 --> 02:27:46.140]  all duped and they are done.
[02:27:46.140 --> 02:27:54.380]  That's right, 25,000 and in the stock market, Trump's the old 25th amendment, absolutely.
[02:27:54.380 --> 02:27:58.540]  Okay, and here's another little tidbit and I have to pick, I'm sorry if I'm jumping,
[02:27:58.540 --> 02:28:04.260]  there's just a lot going on, it's hard to get on sometimes, but so just to let you know,
[02:28:04.260 --> 02:28:10.460]  and Trump also uses the word pocket in parentheses, pockets is very important because it means
[02:28:10.460 --> 02:28:13.540]  we're cutting off the funding of outlawed and everything else.
[02:28:13.540 --> 02:28:18.740]  When they notice the timetable, notice that Schmidt steps down, all the stepping down
[02:28:18.740 --> 02:28:23.300]  when the executive order happens, when sessions, you know, puts forward these new prosecutors
[02:28:23.300 --> 02:28:27.260]  and all of a sudden Bannon loses his mind, this isn't a coincidence.
[02:28:27.260 --> 02:28:31.620]  The executive order has a lot to do with Bannon because with the spectrum, with the specter
[02:28:31.620 --> 02:28:36.260]  bug, some of the emails are pretty damning.
[02:28:36.260 --> 02:28:41.260]  They were going to claim he was crazy in the second year, they were going to push pens,
[02:28:41.260 --> 02:28:45.540]  they were going to talk about the 25th amendment plan with their moles that blew up in their
[02:28:45.540 --> 02:28:48.500]  face, according to all the evidence that's mounting with you straight ahead, we're going
[02:28:48.500 --> 02:28:52.300]  to leave her in to finish up and then she's got her big report, stay with us, they'll
[02:28:52.300 --> 02:28:55.660]  be back, spread the live links folks and local radio stations.
[02:28:55.660 --> 02:28:58.260]  Are you happy washing your hands with harsh chemicals?
[02:28:58.260 --> 02:29:00.380]  Are you happy doing laundry with detergents?
[02:29:00.380 --> 02:29:02.580]  Are you happy paying high prices?
[02:29:02.580 --> 02:29:04.540]  Find your happiness with pure soap.

[02:29:56.500 --> 02:30:02.840]  I want to plow into all of this, but I'm going to spend a few minutes here first, just encouraging
[02:30:02.840 --> 02:30:09.220]  listeners to understand that when you buy t-shirts or water filtration systems or books

[02:30:40.060 --> 02:30:45.660]  A2533139 and your purchase of the products stands with us, stands with America, stands

[02:30:53.140 --> 02:31:22.580]  we need your support.
[02:31:53.580 --> 02:31:55.580]  That's infowarslife.com.
[02:31:55.580 --> 02:31:59.220]  Dr. Grip, you developed Living Defense for us, it took you over a year to do it, why
[02:31:59.220 --> 02:32:00.940]  is this so good?
[02:32:00.940 --> 02:32:05.620]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most,
[02:32:05.620 --> 02:32:10.260]  I mean I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in
[02:32:10.260 --> 02:32:15.940]  my system but right now we're dealing with massive parasites which is anything that's
[02:32:15.940 --> 02:32:19.300]  harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[02:32:19.300 --> 02:32:24.380]  Right now with all the refugees spreading disease around, we have biological warfare
[02:32:24.380 --> 02:32:26.900]  going on everywhere, these are all parasites.
[02:32:26.900 --> 02:32:29.340]  Tell us about all the stuff that's said, there's so many things that are in it.
[02:32:29.340 --> 02:32:34.300]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood, I recommend
[02:32:34.300 --> 02:32:36.980]  doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[02:32:36.980 --> 02:32:40.180]  Alright, well I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today, it
[02:32:40.180 --> 02:32:44.180]  just came back in yesterday, Living Defense, infowarslife.com and folks you can't lose
[02:32:44.180 --> 02:32:49.140]  it's full of stuff that's great for your body period and you support the broadcast.
[02:32:49.140 --> 02:32:53.140]  Live.com, thank you Dr. Group from the Global Healing Center, thank you so much for all
[02:32:53.140 --> 02:33:00.340]  your work sir on this great product.
[02:33:00.340 --> 02:33:29.340]  We are listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:33:29.340 --> 02:33:33.900]  Alright we've got loaded phone lines, we've got Mike Cernovich coming up, riding shotgun
[02:33:33.900 --> 02:33:38.780]  with us here is Millie Weaver, our great info wars reporter, she's been out on the street
[02:33:38.780 --> 02:33:44.900]  looking ahead at 2018 and 2020 and Trump's tweetstorms about election fraud and voter
[02:33:44.900 --> 02:33:51.900]  ID which have been proven absolutely on target in triplicate so that's coming up as well
[02:33:51.900 --> 02:33:55.460]  as Millie rides shotgun with me into the next hour with Mike Cernovich but going back to
[02:33:55.460 --> 02:34:01.700]  Zach who again is a major whistleblower, gives us really great analysis and he's not giving
[02:34:01.700 --> 02:34:06.420]  us anything secret, he's just giving us analysis and his view and he's been really accurate
[02:34:06.420 --> 02:34:10.940]  so far and you see the storm that's here.
[02:34:10.940 --> 02:34:14.620]  Let me ask you to finish your points and then I've got a few questions and Millie has some
[02:34:14.620 --> 02:34:23.420]  here but first what do you make of QAnon and that stuff that's going on, what do you make
[02:34:23.420 --> 02:34:25.660]  of the stuff going on at 8chan?
[02:34:25.660 --> 02:34:26.660]  Zach?
[02:34:26.660 --> 02:34:40.020]  Let me be very careful when I say QAnon is not singular, it's plural, it is or we are,
[02:34:40.020 --> 02:34:45.780]  it's pillars holding up a platform that is the Republic of the United States.
[02:34:45.780 --> 02:34:51.260]  Okay, very interesting, other key points you want to get across people about what's going
[02:34:51.260 --> 02:34:52.260]  on behind the scenes?
[02:34:52.260 --> 02:34:58.500]  I guess what I'm trying to say by that is it's not like one individual with one phenomenon
[02:34:58.500 --> 02:34:59.500]  or...
[02:34:59.500 --> 02:35:02.500]  I understand it's a consortium of people.
[02:35:02.500 --> 02:35:09.940]  It's a few, very few, less than you could count on one hand but it's holding up something
[02:35:09.940 --> 02:35:17.580]  very important and do you remember like memes like a little bit ago about Trump being first
[02:35:17.580 --> 02:35:23.300]  of all one of his most business to have the assets, was it Vince McMahon at the WWF?
[02:35:23.300 --> 02:35:25.300]  Yes, smacking down CNN.
[02:35:25.300 --> 02:35:30.340]  Right, smacking down CNN but what that represents is the WWF, the World Wrestling Federation
[02:35:30.340 --> 02:35:37.220]  which is full second dominance which perceives combat, it's not combat, it's scripted, right?
[02:35:37.220 --> 02:35:41.260]  So when you see this wolf crap, when you see this band and stuff, they left the wolf, yeah
[02:35:41.260 --> 02:35:44.460]  he said bring this wolf to the White House, let the band show his true colors, let him
[02:35:44.460 --> 02:35:48.540]  lose his mind, let his blood sugar rise, let him get a little sloppy, let's see where
[02:35:48.540 --> 02:35:52.140]  you're really at, go make your deal with Miles, try to get a couple more million for
[02:35:52.140 --> 02:35:56.260]  Breitbart, there's people out there who got the PDF and the information and I don't know
[02:35:56.260 --> 02:36:01.340]  what you're thinking, the 25th amendment pushed it at work.
[02:36:01.340 --> 02:36:02.740]  So what would you do if you were him?
[02:36:02.740 --> 02:36:06.900]  If you were an out of shape, out of your mind individual who thought that Donald Trump was
[02:36:06.900 --> 02:36:10.020]  going to crap his pants and then you find yourself in a situation where that's not the
[02:36:10.020 --> 02:36:15.860]  case and you're an evil maniacal sociopath who has to line his pockets and who's envious
[02:36:15.860 --> 02:36:21.100]  of infant wars and I have some interesting emails for you to read about that as well.
[02:36:21.100 --> 02:36:25.300]  Well, I know this, my gut told me not to meet with Bannon.
[02:36:25.300 --> 02:36:29.780]  Trump sees it, Trump sees it, you have to understand Trump sees it, it's not like, you know, this
[02:36:29.780 --> 02:36:33.980]  isn't like a closed room with four or five people where it's like okay, you go do this,
[02:36:33.980 --> 02:36:38.220]  this, this, like the White House is like a huge apparatus where like this is not like,
[02:36:38.220 --> 02:36:40.140]  you have to understand to live the land.
[02:36:40.140 --> 02:36:45.020]  Oh, I know, you know, I haven't gotten a call from Trump in months and he has to literally
[02:36:45.020 --> 02:36:50.860]  sneak away to call people, but it's more genuine than I've seen him in his other phone calls.
[02:36:50.860 --> 02:36:54.620]  Some people, he's very genuine, but Trump really likes the excitement of taking the
[02:36:54.620 --> 02:36:58.260]  globalist on and for them to claim, oh, he didn't really want to win and all this crap.
[02:36:58.260 --> 02:37:01.700]  I mean, Trump is like, keep attacking, never stop, we're going through, I'm not going to
[02:37:01.700 --> 02:37:05.700]  let you down, we will turn the country around, we will get it done and it's like he's reporting
[02:37:05.700 --> 02:37:08.900]  to me and I'm not saying as a power trip, when he came to my audience, and that was
[02:37:08.900 --> 02:37:12.260]  the kickoff and we all knew it was going to happen there, when he came to my audience,
[02:37:12.260 --> 02:37:13.820]  he was saying, I will not let you down.
[02:37:13.820 --> 02:37:17.300]  He was literally being honorable and saying, I'm ready for the mission.
[02:37:17.300 --> 02:37:21.940]  He's a man of his word and that counts for a lot in the political sphere because we've
[02:37:21.940 --> 02:37:23.620]  never seen that before.
[02:37:23.620 --> 02:37:28.020]  Most of the times we get politicians, puppets, whatever they lie to us, tell us what we want
[02:37:28.020 --> 02:37:30.020]  to hear and then they go in there and they don't believe it.
[02:37:30.020 --> 02:37:32.620]  It was the opposite of a narcissistic power trip about him, he's just making it about
[02:37:32.620 --> 02:37:36.860]  him as a logo to beat them trying to kill his image as a figurehead.
[02:37:36.860 --> 02:37:40.420]  That's why they hate it because he's rebuilding it every day as they try to destroy it.
[02:37:40.420 --> 02:37:44.420]  But I'm just saying when it comes down to it, he's into the thrill of the mission, we're
[02:37:44.420 --> 02:37:46.020]  all on together.
[02:37:46.020 --> 02:37:47.260]  That's the thrill for Trump.
[02:37:47.260 --> 02:37:48.700]  It's not about narcissism.
[02:37:48.700 --> 02:37:49.700]  He makes fun of himself.
[02:37:49.700 --> 02:37:53.740]  It's all a big joke when it comes to him, but when it comes to the country, he's for
[02:37:53.740 --> 02:37:54.740]  real.
[02:37:54.740 --> 02:37:56.940]  That's why they call him mentally ill because he goes, he really cares.
[02:37:56.940 --> 02:37:59.060]  I'm sorry, Zach, go ahead.
[02:37:59.060 --> 02:38:05.620]  There was no term fake news before the Trump Phenomenon, so why not let the wolf in the
[02:38:05.620 --> 02:38:06.620]  White House?
[02:38:06.620 --> 02:38:08.580]  This dude is going to sell some clothes.
[02:38:08.580 --> 02:38:09.580]  Look at him.
[02:38:09.580 --> 02:38:16.780]  You look at Ben and anybody who sat down with him, I don't mean to, actually I will, I don't
[02:38:16.780 --> 02:38:20.340]  care because what they did to Breitbart, I'm aware of what they did to Breitbart and we
[02:38:20.340 --> 02:38:24.820]  can look at the PDF style, but Ben and there's no Breitbart just because he happens to be
[02:38:24.820 --> 02:38:25.820]  there now.
[02:38:25.820 --> 02:38:30.780]  He's a slob, he's out of his mind, he thought he could be Karl Rove, but Donald Trump's
[02:38:30.780 --> 02:38:35.620]  not George W., so he made that very clear during one of the debates.
[02:38:35.620 --> 02:38:39.700]  You know, Zach, I kind of have a question that's been on my mind because I was listening
[02:38:39.700 --> 02:38:44.660]  to you earlier and you were talking about North Korea and we all know the globalists
[02:38:44.660 --> 02:38:48.220]  want to take Trump out, but there's been a lot of stuff that the mainstream media has
[02:38:48.220 --> 02:38:55.740]  been pushing with almost foreshadowing headlines that somehow Trump's going to be boisterous
[02:38:55.740 --> 02:38:57.780]  and North Korea is going to attack us.
[02:38:57.780 --> 02:39:01.180]  Could they try and use the 25th Amendment to get rid of Trump, of North Korea?
[02:39:01.180 --> 02:39:05.780]  But is there also something, do you know of any information out there in the back channel
[02:39:05.780 --> 02:39:09.860]  of the globalists actually plotting to work with North Korea to have North Korea attack
[02:39:09.860 --> 02:39:13.860]  us in some way that it can be blown up at Trump's face?
[02:39:13.860 --> 02:39:19.380]  What this is is truly, that's a great question, Lily, and what this is is like, it's truly
[02:39:19.380 --> 02:39:24.820]  a sad situation because this is a generational plan that's been going on and they spoke
[02:39:24.820 --> 02:39:28.220]  about the armistice, anybody who's been in South Korea and the DMZ, like obfuscation
[02:39:28.220 --> 02:39:29.220]  over there for a bit.
[02:39:29.220 --> 02:39:34.380]  This has been going on for like 50 plus years, right, so it's like, eventually something
[02:39:34.380 --> 02:39:37.380]  had to occur and they were invoking strategic patience.
[02:39:37.380 --> 02:39:41.660]  But when it came to Trump and he said, hey, you know, what happened in 9-11, what's happened
[02:39:41.660 --> 02:39:45.380]  with our foreign policy, what's going on here, eventually it had to come to an end.
[02:39:45.380 --> 02:39:49.900]  And then once we realized how big of a pond they were being used in the global scheme
[02:39:49.900 --> 02:39:53.820]  of fingers was important and I made a call and I said North Korea, Yemen and Iran are
[02:39:53.820 --> 02:39:58.300]  all connected, there won't be no kinetic war with Iran because the war is going to happen
[02:39:58.300 --> 02:40:01.060]  in the streets as we're saying now.
[02:40:01.060 --> 02:40:04.660]  North Korea is going to be, there's going to be a strike in North Korea, there's just
[02:40:04.660 --> 02:40:09.380]  no way around it and it's terrible, but it's going to be limited, it's not like, you know,
[02:40:09.380 --> 02:40:10.380]  come to a whiteout.
[02:40:10.380 --> 02:40:11.860]  Yeah, we'll see what the Russians and the Chinese did.
[02:40:11.860 --> 02:40:17.300]  Do you think it's possible that we could see North Korea strike South Korea and that
[02:40:17.300 --> 02:40:18.300]  gave them no chance?
[02:40:18.300 --> 02:40:23.660]  No, but I opened the call, this is the most important thing, and this is the inside information
[02:40:23.660 --> 02:40:26.940]  that people have to, you know, pick up the crumbs or connect the dots.
[02:40:26.940 --> 02:40:32.380]  This SpaceX Falcon 9 with the zoom of payload, what happens in North Korea, you know, they
[02:40:32.380 --> 02:40:36.980]  have all this stuff, they have all this capability, what if they don't have any power?
[02:40:36.980 --> 02:40:41.420]  What if we have like the most sophisticated EMP over their country where they can't retaliate
[02:40:41.420 --> 02:40:45.900]  a week and we come in with covert operations, take out the power leaders, do you think those,
[02:40:45.900 --> 02:40:50.260]  what human being on the planet wants to be a slave, what if they're in fear, so if we
[02:40:50.260 --> 02:40:55.220]  want to come in, if we could stop their capability, if we could remove their power, show the prosperity
[02:40:55.220 --> 02:40:59.900]  and allow a true transition of real leadership to happen there, that's possible, and that's
[02:40:59.900 --> 02:41:05.740]  possible only because of the technology that we have nowadays in Silicon Valley falling
[02:41:05.740 --> 02:41:06.740]  in line.
[02:41:06.740 --> 02:41:11.540]  We're not talking about complete annihilation, we're not talking about, you know, a nuclear
[02:41:11.540 --> 02:41:16.300]  attack like we've seen 60 years ago, 70 years ago, we're talking about sophistication,
[02:41:16.300 --> 02:41:20.420]  the lights shut off, people are gone, they wake up and they say, you know what, life
[02:41:20.420 --> 02:41:24.780]  sucks there, it's been sucking for a long time and guess what, I would like a better
[02:41:24.780 --> 02:41:29.620]  life and it doesn't have to be kinetic, we have the capability and with SpaceX and we're
[02:41:29.620 --> 02:41:33.300]  what we're doing, what we're doing, it does not have to be kinetic, it will be deadly
[02:41:33.300 --> 02:41:37.940]  at some level because there are people who are just pulling in, but it's, this is beyond
[02:41:37.940 --> 02:41:38.940]  everything.
[02:41:38.940 --> 02:41:40.620]  I know I'm staying, turning the power completely off, even though they don't have it in most
[02:41:40.620 --> 02:41:44.860]  of the countries, I'm killing a bunch of people, but they're already living hell.
[02:41:44.860 --> 02:41:50.820]  But let me make one thing clear, let me make one thing clear, this Zoomer mission, this
[02:41:50.820 --> 02:41:55.860]  is that, you know, it's US Air Force, it's US Air Force in there, but it's SpaceX delivering
[02:41:55.860 --> 02:41:58.580]  the capability, it's called Crew Dragon.
[02:41:58.580 --> 02:42:00.140]  What did Trump talk about?
[02:42:00.140 --> 02:42:05.900]  Fire and fury, fire and fury like the world has never seen, what is a dragon?
[02:42:05.900 --> 02:42:09.380]  I don't think people understand what's going on, this is, I mean, we're living in a real-life
[02:42:09.380 --> 02:42:14.820]  movie that's never been told, this is unbelievable, it's not like, yeah, they are brainwashed
[02:42:14.820 --> 02:42:21.340]  but they're not completely gone, there will be a strike, there will be absolute warfare,
[02:42:21.340 --> 02:42:24.900]  but something's going to occur where their capability is completely smashed.
[02:42:24.900 --> 02:42:27.700]  Three days ago, they did it, I don't even know if it's been reported, three days ago
[02:42:27.700 --> 02:42:34.620]  they had a test in North Korea that was quote-unquote foiled in their own missile crashments to
[02:42:34.620 --> 02:42:39.460]  be of themselves, okay, so they hit themselves with the missile because they had a failed
[02:42:39.460 --> 02:42:40.460]  missile test.
[02:42:40.460 --> 02:42:45.460]  The people, they're not going to go along with it, this is all happening, this is 2018.
[02:42:45.460 --> 02:42:49.500]  Well, more than that, they've got all the particle beams on the jets, they can shoot
[02:42:49.500 --> 02:42:50.500]  those missiles down.
[02:42:50.500 --> 02:42:56.420]  I've got one more point, I'm going to get to her big report, thank you, she's powerful.

[02:43:55.500 --> 02:43:59.900]  The elusive Matt Drudge has hinted there may be a shakeup at Breitbart News.
[02:43:59.900 --> 02:44:03.780]  He tweeted a photo of Andrew Breitbart with the accompanying text.
[02:44:03.780 --> 02:44:08.900]  The terrific Larry Salove and Susie Breitbart will take Breitbart into the fresh future.
[02:44:08.900 --> 02:44:13.500]  Has it really been ten years since Andrew told me on Santa Monica Pier he was going
[02:44:13.500 --> 02:44:14.500]  to do it?
[02:44:14.500 --> 02:44:18.900]  His first hire, Alex Marlowe, became one of the best news editors in the world.
[02:44:18.900 --> 02:44:23.620]  The Washington Times reports that Salove was Andrew Breitbart's longtime friend and business
[02:44:23.620 --> 02:44:29.380]  partner who became the president and CEO of Breitbart News after Andrew's sudden and tragic
[02:44:29.380 --> 02:44:30.860]  death in 2012.
[02:44:30.860 --> 02:44:35.340]  Although he was brought on initially to serve in a more advisory function, Bannon's influence
[02:44:35.340 --> 02:44:38.060]  has steered the site in recent years.
[02:44:38.060 --> 02:44:42.700]  After the president's verbal dressing down of his former staffer, it seems unlikely Steve
[02:44:42.700 --> 02:44:44.980]  Bannon will stay at the helm of Breitbart.
[02:44:44.980 --> 02:44:49.740]  Drudge's tweet suggests a decision has all but been made to oust Bannon and those who
[02:44:49.740 --> 02:44:52.940]  helped create Breitbart are taking back the reins.
[02:44:52.940 --> 02:45:01.060]  Leigh Ann McAdoo, Infowars.com Climb to the top of the food chain with Alpha Power by

[02:45:08.780 --> 02:45:15.180]  levels begin to decline starting around 30 at a rate of about 1-2% per year.

[02:46:01.100 --> 02:46:06.460]  a lot of money while you get high quality products and fund the Infowar, a 360 win.

[02:46:17.500 --> 02:46:20.980]  auto ship because we hold back a surplus for auto ship customers.
[02:46:20.980 --> 02:46:26.200]  Number three, we're giving you free shipping on all orders above $50.
[02:46:26.200 --> 02:46:30.420]  Listeners have been requesting this for years because it's so easy to forget to reorder the

[02:46:52.460 --> 02:46:59.820]  And all out of stock items are never out of stock when you sign up for auto ship.
[02:46:59.820 --> 02:47:28.660]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:47:28.660 --> 02:47:34.100]  And we've got Zach here with us, just such grave information we're talking about and
[02:47:34.100 --> 02:47:39.140]  everything Zach has talked about here with us is either public domain or it gets verified
[02:47:39.140 --> 02:47:42.900]  and it's a perspective into some of the things that are going on.
[02:47:42.900 --> 02:47:46.860]  I think we're going a little bit over the edge here with him getting into payloads on
[02:47:46.860 --> 02:47:52.460]  missiles and on rockets, I'll tell you there's all sorts of stuff like that up there.
[02:47:52.460 --> 02:47:56.440]  Just what they've accidentally leaked, they had that stuff up there in the late 70s, Star
[02:47:56.440 --> 02:47:59.460]  Wars didn't begin until it branded at that in the 80s.
[02:47:59.460 --> 02:48:03.220]  But before it was just a space command, which they just announced officially a few years
[02:48:03.220 --> 02:48:06.700]  ago, it's been around since they formed NASA.
[02:48:06.700 --> 02:48:09.740]  NASA is the public name of space command.
[02:48:09.740 --> 02:48:13.940]  And that is the real clandestine breakaway government that Trump has been hinting he
[02:48:13.940 --> 02:48:18.060]  wants to now open up to the general public and take us light years into the future.
[02:48:18.060 --> 02:48:20.300]  But that's a whole other subject in a whole other area.
[02:48:20.300 --> 02:48:24.780]  I just know the stuff I was told about family that worked in some of those areas was that
[02:48:24.780 --> 02:48:28.380]  the stuff they saw in the 60s is what we have basically now.
[02:48:28.380 --> 02:48:31.900]  Yeah, they're hiding technology essentially.
[02:48:31.900 --> 02:48:36.540]  Supposedly, I've heard that there's this museum of things that'll never be because
[02:48:36.540 --> 02:48:43.340]  it's like hoarded technology and information that essentially has been bought and the patents
[02:48:43.340 --> 02:48:47.180]  have been bought and it's essentially technology that would free people.
[02:48:47.180 --> 02:48:50.980]  It's known as disruptive technology and there's kind of an allegory at the end of Raiders
[02:48:50.980 --> 02:48:54.300]  of the Lost Ark where the art goes in, there's a whole warehouse and that stuff.
[02:48:54.300 --> 02:48:55.780]  And that's basically what it is.
[02:48:55.780 --> 02:49:00.580]  And the argument for the total surveillance is we've got such high tech weapons and systems,
[02:49:00.580 --> 02:49:04.780]  we've got to surveil what everybody's doing to keep control, but then they're randomly
[02:49:04.780 --> 02:49:07.860]  gene splicing everywhere and doing all this insane crap.
[02:49:07.860 --> 02:49:08.860]  It's devilish.
[02:49:08.860 --> 02:49:10.820]  It's a race to become God.
[02:49:10.820 --> 02:49:15.020]  I told everybody this and now Elon Musk is blowing the whistle and sounds exact word
[02:49:15.020 --> 02:49:17.420]  for word when I'm telling you because he didn't get it from me.
[02:49:17.420 --> 02:49:19.500]  That's what goes on behind the closed doors.
[02:49:19.500 --> 02:49:24.820]  And they pick and choose which technology they think is going to disrupt the system.
[02:49:24.820 --> 02:49:28.020]  Whereas look at how much iPhones have disrupted the system.
[02:49:28.020 --> 02:49:29.020]  Disrupts are all right.
[02:49:29.020 --> 02:49:32.420]  They're going to help us and call it disruptive and everything that is disruptive, they roll
[02:49:32.420 --> 02:49:33.420]  out.
[02:49:33.420 --> 02:49:35.300]  It's always in version because that's their system.
[02:49:35.300 --> 02:49:36.300]  Exactly.
[02:49:36.300 --> 02:49:37.300]  We're going to continue.
[02:49:37.300 --> 02:49:40.260]  You're here because I want to hear your great report, but I'm running on and we've got to
[02:49:40.260 --> 02:49:41.260]  get back to Zach.
[02:49:41.260 --> 02:49:43.100]  Zach, go ahead and finish up, my friend.
[02:49:43.100 --> 02:49:44.100]  Yeah.
[02:49:44.100 --> 02:49:48.900]  I mean, whether or not you think it's overstretched and makes a mistake, I mean, it's public
[02:49:48.900 --> 02:49:49.900]  information.
[02:49:49.900 --> 02:49:53.620]  Look at the, look at the Air Force and the DOD contracts that have been fulfilled by SpaceX,
[02:49:53.620 --> 02:49:56.020]  nobody else, SpaceX.
[02:49:56.020 --> 02:49:59.740]  So we're a dead together, whether we like it or not.
[02:49:59.740 --> 02:50:03.580]  And I can tell you firsthand that Elon Musk is a patriot, I can tell you for his hand
[02:50:03.580 --> 02:50:09.260]  on the sign as a patriot and I can tell you that any, if Hillary Clinton had become president
[02:50:09.260 --> 02:50:10.260]  of the United States.
[02:50:10.260 --> 02:50:12.940]  You can just look at Assange and he looks genuine and smart.
[02:50:12.940 --> 02:50:14.420]  It's like evil people look at him.
[02:50:14.420 --> 02:50:15.420]  Let me hit to it.
[02:50:15.420 --> 02:50:16.660]  Let me hit to it.
[02:50:16.660 --> 02:50:23.940]  I can tell you firsthand that Assange and Musk are on our team.
[02:50:23.940 --> 02:50:28.420]  They are aware of you, they're fans of you, but like anybody else, they run in circles
[02:50:28.420 --> 02:50:31.580]  where it's like, you know, people want to be popular, this and this, and some things
[02:50:31.580 --> 02:50:32.580]  are sensational.
[02:50:32.580 --> 02:50:34.140]  And it's the same thing with Farrakhan.
[02:50:34.140 --> 02:50:37.300]  He said this, he said that, I said, I think you just got to listen, listen to what he's
[02:50:37.300 --> 02:50:38.300]  really saying.
[02:50:38.300 --> 02:50:41.580]  I can imagine having the, you know, the information, the knowledge of Alex, like let me bridge
[02:50:41.580 --> 02:50:44.820]  that gap and we could do that and look what we've done, look what we've completed.
[02:50:44.820 --> 02:50:51.940]  And this week in Cape Canaveral, when this SpaceX launch takes off, Operation Zuma,
[02:50:51.940 --> 02:50:54.900]  you know, what is it, the most successful president ever?
[02:50:54.900 --> 02:50:57.460]  It's just 45, okay?
[02:50:57.460 --> 02:51:03.580]  On Christmas day, you have the Secretary of Defense tweeting out an image of, you know,
[02:51:03.580 --> 02:51:05.500]  Washington crossing the Delaware.
[02:51:05.500 --> 02:51:07.500]  And I was in Morocco on the 25th.
[02:51:07.500 --> 02:51:09.380]  I couldn't spend the 25th in America.
[02:51:09.380 --> 02:51:14.580]  And I can tell you right now, on the 27th, we had some specific individuals connected
[02:51:14.580 --> 02:51:20.060]  to the Obama Foundation, not specifically, but his security, if you want to call it that,
[02:51:20.060 --> 02:51:23.900]  you want to come, I just want to, I'm going to state this right now and write, like, just
[02:51:23.900 --> 02:51:24.900]  to be clear.
[02:51:24.900 --> 02:51:29.620]  And like, there's nothing, like there's nothing problematic about this.
[02:51:29.620 --> 02:51:35.620]  Obama Foundation was meant to give a speech in April in Marrakesh and, you know, late
[02:51:35.620 --> 02:51:36.620]  April.
[02:51:36.620 --> 02:51:42.500]  Sorry, that was canceled, Baracko, I'm sorry about that, but we know about the pay to play.
[02:51:42.500 --> 02:51:46.380]  We told the majesty, we told the CEO of Mosaic in Florida.
[02:51:46.380 --> 02:51:50.100]  And next time you come to the Rift Mountain, and next time you come to check me, we'll
[02:51:50.100 --> 02:51:51.100]  see how it goes.
[02:51:51.100 --> 02:51:54.940]  It didn't work too well on the 27th of December, and here we are talking, so I'm doing what
[02:51:54.940 --> 02:51:55.940]  I'm doing.
[02:51:55.940 --> 02:52:02.140]  And then the money has, is being cut off from, from, how about Soros, how's that creature
[02:52:02.140 --> 02:52:03.140]  doing?
[02:52:03.140 --> 02:52:04.140]  Jesus Christ.
[02:52:04.140 --> 02:52:09.020]  Soros, first of all, Soros is running for his life because they will indict him.
[02:52:09.020 --> 02:52:12.700]  Listen, it might just, it might not even be government thinks that somebody might just
[02:52:12.700 --> 02:52:22.980]  get him, but Soros is, first of all, quack is in bed with Soros.
[02:52:22.980 --> 02:52:25.140]  Quack is talking to Bannon.
[02:52:25.140 --> 02:52:28.900]  So right there, we have a huge problem, like, I don't know Bannon personally.
[02:52:28.900 --> 02:52:35.060]  I've seen some PDS and some emails, but like, I thought it was all fishy after what happened
[02:52:35.060 --> 02:52:38.220]  to Andrew Graeber, and I didn't want to say anything about it because, you know, Trump
[02:52:38.220 --> 02:52:42.260]  actually did get elected, but I understand what he's doing now.
[02:52:42.260 --> 02:52:45.860]  Like he's letting them, you know, hang themselves, he's seeing what they're doing, and it's
[02:52:45.860 --> 02:52:51.300]  only the, you know, he's going into the second year now, but Soros is a big problem, but
[02:52:51.300 --> 02:52:57.140]  I'm telling you right now, the Huma Abedin emails, it was so sloppy, and it was so,
[02:52:57.140 --> 02:53:03.380]  it was so blatant, and with the specs, with the specter bug, we have it all neared, they're
[02:53:03.380 --> 02:53:04.380]  done.
[02:53:04.380 --> 02:53:09.140]  The prosecutors are out there, it's only January, just wait till February.
[02:53:09.140 --> 02:53:11.420]  How does Eric Prince, how does Eric Prince time this?
[02:53:11.420 --> 02:53:13.420]  We know he, you know, the intercept.
[02:53:13.420 --> 02:53:19.940]  Eric Prince is a great guy, Eric is a great guy, obviously I know Eric well, we protect
[02:53:19.940 --> 02:53:20.940]  the president.
[02:53:20.940 --> 02:53:21.940]  What do you want me to say?
[02:53:21.940 --> 02:53:22.940]  You know what I'm saying?
[02:53:22.940 --> 02:53:26.420]  Like, you know, this had to happen, and what I said on the show several times, the second
[02:53:26.420 --> 02:53:27.420]  American Revolution.
[02:53:27.420 --> 02:53:32.260]  Eric Prince is a good guy, the problem with Eric Prince is, again, with some of the
[02:53:32.260 --> 02:53:36.700]  specter stuff, and not only that, they have, they have collection data of just like massive
[02:53:36.700 --> 02:53:41.540]  amounts of phone calls, which is like problematic, and emails, it's like you're talking at 11
[02:53:41.540 --> 02:53:42.540]  o'clock at night with somebody.
[02:53:42.540 --> 02:53:45.620]  Obviously during the heyday, when everybody was getting paid during the hella burn days
[02:53:45.620 --> 02:53:49.020]  and the chain days, people were collecting money, but Eric Prince had to change their
[02:53:49.020 --> 02:53:52.980]  heart, or at least he seems to be pure, he seems to be at least, you know, have the president
[02:53:52.980 --> 02:53:58.220]  like, you know, I don't know, seems to be protecting him, but he has a problematic
[02:53:58.220 --> 02:54:04.380]  past in some certain capacities, but I mean, they don't know he's perfect.
[02:54:04.380 --> 02:54:09.020]  But as of late, as of two, as of two months before the election, you know, he's done
[02:54:09.020 --> 02:54:13.260]  great things, but I've been wary of a lot of the PNCs, I don't work with some of those
[02:54:13.260 --> 02:54:19.340]  PNCs, I do my own thing, I think really getting into that stuff, but Prince is a good guy
[02:54:19.340 --> 02:54:23.340]  as far as I'm concerned, nothing too compromising, especially not in the last 12 months, and
[02:54:23.340 --> 02:54:31.340]  his operators have done great work, and you know, let's say this in closing and powerful
[02:54:31.340 --> 02:54:34.020]  information, because I asked Millie in here, and I'm being rude to you just sitting there,
[02:54:34.020 --> 02:54:38.940]  but she doesn't mind, I mean, we've been talking about this for hours, no, no, no, no, we appreciate
[02:54:38.940 --> 02:54:45.780]  you, but here's the point, the arrogance of the Clintons and Soros and the globalists
[02:54:45.780 --> 02:54:50.900]  is just delusional, but they've got to know now that there's no way they're getting away
[02:54:50.900 --> 02:54:54.540]  now, there's no way they're going to win, even if they killed me, killed Trump, killed
[02:54:54.540 --> 02:54:57.500]  Matt Rudge, I mean, they're not going to be able to stop us now.
[02:54:57.500 --> 02:55:03.820]  Okay, so Assange had, I had a course he had, okay, what a course to say, you're going to
[02:55:03.820 --> 02:55:06.980]  see people fleeing the country, you're going to see suicides, you're going to see this,
[02:55:06.980 --> 02:55:08.140]  you're going to see that.
[02:55:08.140 --> 02:55:13.300]  Boomer Abedin is going to play this weird, you know, we're in such this culture now where
[02:55:13.300 --> 02:55:18.340]  it's like, I'm a victim, look how big of a monster my husband was, which he was, a complete
[02:55:18.340 --> 02:55:22.820]  freak and just a tool, but it's like, it doesn't excuse you from what you've been doing and
[02:55:22.820 --> 02:55:27.860]  who you know in Pakistan and not to mention the order that's been passed, hey, Pakistan,
[02:55:27.860 --> 02:55:31.180]  how about you're not getting close to a billion dollars this year, how does that sound?
[02:55:31.180 --> 02:55:34.740]  It's all, it's all happening, there's definitely a big war going on, all right, thank you so
[02:55:34.740 --> 02:55:39.380]  much, Zach, and I'd like to talk to you sometime today if you can, off air or tomorrow because
[02:55:39.380 --> 02:55:43.660]  I've got some questions for you and they get nothing classified, I just want to get your
[02:55:43.660 --> 02:55:46.660]  take on a couple of things, but you already see everything.
[02:55:46.660 --> 02:55:53.700]  Hey, as of after I leave this, when this launch happens on Saturday or Sunday, depending
[02:55:53.700 --> 02:55:57.220]  on the weather here, I've got to fly into London for two days and then we'll be back
[02:55:57.220 --> 02:56:03.260]  into the States next week, but we need to talk because we're changing the world.
[02:56:03.260 --> 02:56:07.660]  Yeah, I would love to talk to you.
[02:56:07.660 --> 02:56:08.660]  Sure, sure.
[02:56:08.660 --> 02:56:09.660]  Well, I mean, here's the deal.
[02:56:09.660 --> 02:56:11.300]  I mean, their money's drying up.
[02:56:11.300 --> 02:56:12.300]  I've seen it.
[02:56:12.300 --> 02:56:16.620]  They had operations against us that as soon as the Saudi Arabia stuff happened, man,
[02:56:16.620 --> 02:56:18.220]  it got cut off.
[02:56:18.220 --> 02:56:22.620]  And that's why, and that's why the stuff they were doing like suddenly went, but a bunch
[02:56:22.620 --> 02:56:27.020]  of their idiots like Hitler youth are out there as the Russians are rolling into Berlin
[02:56:27.020 --> 02:56:31.860]  in 1945 and the Nazis have already fled and they got 12 year old kids up front.
[02:56:31.860 --> 02:56:35.820]  I mean, all the people at BuzzFeed and Media Matters, they're still at their machine guns
[02:56:35.820 --> 02:56:38.060]  and three million troops are rolling in.
[02:56:38.060 --> 02:56:39.060]  I don't think they understand.
[02:56:39.060 --> 02:56:40.220]  And we're not just saying that.
[02:56:40.220 --> 02:56:44.180]  I mean, three million Russian troops use, they love blaming all Russians in the Gallagoy.
[02:56:44.180 --> 02:56:47.740]  Three million Russian troops are about to face down a half million German kids.
[02:56:47.740 --> 02:56:52.660]  Well, I think that they're actually going to allow Hillary Clinton and Huma Abedin to
[02:56:52.660 --> 02:56:53.860]  take the fall.
[02:56:53.860 --> 02:56:58.900]  The Democratic leadership are going to back away from Hillary Clinton, allow her to take
[02:56:58.900 --> 02:57:03.700]  the fall so that then whoever they run in the midterms over they run during the 2020
[02:57:03.700 --> 02:57:10.740]  presidential election, they can have they can claim to have a disassociation from Hillary
[02:57:10.740 --> 02:57:11.740]  Clinton.
[02:57:11.740 --> 02:57:16.100]  I've already seen with Joe Biden, who there's been a lot of talk of him running in 2020.
[02:57:16.100 --> 02:57:20.060]  He's actually already on his book tour and he's been criticizing Hillary Clinton.
[02:57:20.060 --> 02:57:21.460]  You think, oh, why would he be criticized?
[02:57:21.460 --> 02:57:24.260]  Well, he's not actually really not liking Hillary.
[02:57:24.260 --> 02:57:27.900]  He's trying to create a distance between himself and Hillary Clinton because they know that
[02:57:27.900 --> 02:57:29.940]  they're going to let her take the fall.
[02:57:29.940 --> 02:57:30.940]  That's perfectly said.
[02:57:30.940 --> 02:57:31.940]  That's absolutely right.
[02:57:31.940 --> 02:57:32.940]  Zach, thank you so much.
[02:57:32.940 --> 02:57:33.940]  Be safe.
[02:57:33.940 --> 02:57:34.940]  He's gone.
[02:57:34.940 --> 02:57:35.940]  We're going to come back.
[02:57:35.940 --> 02:57:36.940]  We're going to get your special report.
[02:57:36.940 --> 02:57:37.940]  Mike Cernovich loved to hear it.
[02:57:37.940 --> 02:57:38.940]  He loves calls as well.
[02:57:38.940 --> 02:57:39.940]  He's such a great guy.
[02:57:39.940 --> 02:57:41.940]  He knows the show.
[02:57:41.940 --> 02:57:45.940]  He loves us to kind of take it over whether he likes free for all fourth hour coming up.
[02:57:45.940 --> 02:57:52.340]  Brett Smith, author of Thump the First Bundred Days, explained to people about Thump and
[02:57:52.340 --> 02:57:54.740]  why this is an important book and how it ties into things.
[02:57:54.740 --> 02:57:57.020]  And I just thought to myself, you know, this is brilliant.
[02:57:57.020 --> 02:58:01.740]  This is the ultimate juxtaposition of what everyone says about the president.
[02:58:01.740 --> 02:58:06.620]  You know, they say that he's a racist, misogynist, sexist, bigoted, homophobic Nazi.
[02:58:06.620 --> 02:58:11.460]  So what better way to counter that than by turning him into an incredibly cute, lovable,
[02:58:11.460 --> 02:58:12.460]  fluffy little bunny?
[02:58:12.460 --> 02:58:15.260]  It's got that fun rhyming structure to it.
[02:58:15.260 --> 02:58:16.260]  It's actually hilarious.
[02:58:16.260 --> 02:58:17.860]  I was cracking up reading the whole book.
[02:58:17.860 --> 02:58:19.020]  My wife was cracking up.
[02:58:19.020 --> 02:58:20.020]  And it's a great book for adults.
[02:58:20.020 --> 02:58:21.300]  It's a great book for children.
[02:58:21.300 --> 02:58:22.940]  We're selling the book.
[02:58:22.940 --> 02:58:29.060]  We've got it bundled as well here with a one-off poster that's a collector's item.
[02:58:29.060 --> 02:58:33.820]  Both of these, the book, the graphic novel, and the poster are $29.95 that helps support
[02:58:33.820 --> 02:58:34.820]  us.
[02:58:34.820 --> 02:58:39.220]  The book thumped the first hundred days in Alan Jones and thumped the art of Info Wars
[02:58:39.220 --> 02:58:47.700]  for a limited edition at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:58:47.700 --> 02:58:49.340]  Matt and Ohio, you're on the air.
[02:58:49.340 --> 02:58:50.340]  Another Matt.
[02:58:50.340 --> 02:58:51.340]  Go ahead.
[02:58:51.340 --> 02:58:55.100]  Hey, listen, I just wanted to say real quick, I'm a longtime listener of Info Wars.
[02:58:55.100 --> 02:58:59.500]  And I just wanted to say that the t-shirts that you guys are offering are absolutely
[02:58:59.500 --> 02:59:00.500]  fantastic.
[02:59:00.500 --> 02:59:04.820]  And that really is a great way to deal with this battle in the Info War.
[02:59:04.820 --> 02:59:09.260]  It might seem like a simple thing, but they're particularly these slogan t-shirts that you
[02:59:09.260 --> 02:59:11.980]  guys got up right now are absolutely amazing.
[02:59:11.980 --> 02:59:12.980]  Well, thank you.
[02:59:12.980 --> 02:59:17.860]  My favorite new one is the Don't Tread on Me, but said it says Won't Tread on Me.
[02:59:17.860 --> 02:59:20.780]  And it's a big Daeglo snake, Gadsden snake.
[02:59:20.780 --> 02:59:23.740]  And then it's got the American flag, InfoWars.com on the right arm.
[02:59:23.740 --> 02:59:29.380]  I mean, that's a great way just to meet like-minded people and spread the word and also exercise
[02:59:29.380 --> 02:59:30.380]  free speech.
[02:59:30.380 --> 02:59:35.900]  The newest one is Trigger Warning T-Shirt, Trigger Warning T-Shirt, which is the symbol
[02:59:35.900 --> 02:59:40.380]  of a trigger with a yield sign in the InfoWars.com on the back.
[02:59:40.380 --> 02:59:49.780]  That is the new shirt of the month available exclusively at InfoWars.com.
[02:59:49.780 --> 03:00:05.580]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[03:00:05.580 --> 03:00:10.060]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[03:00:10.060 --> 03:00:12.620]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[03:00:12.620 --> 03:00:18.860]  We're going to tweak this report out at Real Alex Jones the moment in posting it to InfoWars.com.
[03:00:18.860 --> 03:00:24.620]  And Joe Obama, 2020 to rival Trump, a special report here with Millie Weaver that we're
[03:00:24.620 --> 03:00:27.380]  going to air some of in the next segment as Mike Cernovich joins us.
[03:00:27.380 --> 03:00:30.060]  And InfoWars have been holding, and I appreciate it, and they're all getting a free T-Shirt
[03:00:30.060 --> 03:00:32.860]  or something for doing it where they can hang up, but I'm going to practice those calls
[03:00:32.860 --> 03:00:33.860]  with Mike Cernovich.
[03:00:33.860 --> 03:00:36.060]  He always has a lot to talk about as well.
[03:00:36.060 --> 03:00:39.660]  But Millie, you really, during the breaks, you're on a roll here laying out the big fight
[03:00:39.660 --> 03:00:44.900]  election fraud, what they're planning, the super ticket, Joe Biden and Michelle Obama,
[03:00:44.900 --> 03:00:45.900]  Michael Obama.
[03:00:45.900 --> 03:00:49.500]  You know, Joe Obama is not actually a term that I just kind of created.
[03:00:49.500 --> 03:00:50.660]  It's already out there.
[03:00:50.660 --> 03:00:55.500]  There are tons of Joe Obama 2020 merchandise that you can already purchase, and Joe Biden
[03:00:55.500 --> 03:00:57.500]  2020 merchandise.
[03:00:57.500 --> 03:01:03.420]  And so we've seen tons of articles, leftist media outlets pushing for Joe Biden to run
[03:01:03.420 --> 03:01:07.580]  in 2020, and it's very likely that he will.
[03:01:07.580 --> 03:01:13.020]  And if you look at the past statistics of vice presidents winning elections, it looks
[03:01:13.020 --> 03:01:14.020]  very good.
[03:01:14.020 --> 03:01:18.220]  So if the Democrats want a sure bet against President Trump, they are going to run Joe
[03:01:18.220 --> 03:01:23.020]  Biden, and they're also most likely going to run Michelle Obama.
[03:01:23.020 --> 03:01:27.380]  But I think it's more likely that we could see her in a vice president ticket, so essentially
[03:01:27.380 --> 03:01:35.580]  rather than having Obama Biden, we will have Biden Obama or what they're calling Joe Obama.
[03:01:35.580 --> 03:01:40.220]  And what's interesting here is when I went around Austin and talked to a bunch of liberals
[03:01:40.220 --> 03:01:46.780]  and asked them who they wanted to see run for president, they literally all had Michelle
[03:01:46.780 --> 03:01:49.380]  Obama off the top of their lips.
[03:01:49.380 --> 03:01:54.780]  And even the ones that I asked, Michelle Obama, they did not take a second to rethink.
[03:01:54.780 --> 03:01:57.820]  And again, these women are well-meaning people.
[03:01:57.820 --> 03:02:00.580]  These are literal mind control vicar.
[03:02:00.580 --> 03:02:05.180]  And they're thinking, oh, well, she was a first lady, so why not have her then?
[03:02:05.180 --> 03:02:09.700]  And since Hillary is taking this fall, why not have Michelle Obama?
[03:02:09.700 --> 03:02:11.140]  And so that's what we're looking at here.
[03:02:11.140 --> 03:02:18.460]  But we're also looking at a tough 2018 midterm election, although there are a lot of Democrat
[03:02:18.460 --> 03:02:20.620]  seats that are up for the midterms.
[03:02:20.620 --> 03:02:26.220]  They only need two seats more than they have right now to have the majority in the Senate
[03:02:26.220 --> 03:02:29.860]  and essentially try to turn Trump into a lame duck president.
[03:02:29.860 --> 03:02:34.820]  We've seen them perform miracles like they did in Alabama, or should we say voter fraud?
[03:02:34.820 --> 03:02:41.620]  And it's no wonder that Trump, I'm sure he has privy information about Alabama and about
[03:02:41.620 --> 03:02:43.180]  what all went down there.
[03:02:43.180 --> 03:02:49.020]  He's been tweeting out just recently today that voter identification laws need to be
[03:02:49.020 --> 03:02:51.100]  put into place.
[03:02:51.100 --> 03:02:55.420]  He says that the voter fraud in these liberal states, the liberal states have been refusing
[03:02:55.420 --> 03:02:59.300]  to put forward their voting records.
[03:02:59.300 --> 03:03:06.780]  So at that point, even Harvard did a computer check, and the estimate is seven plus million
[03:03:06.780 --> 03:03:09.460]  people voting in the names of dead people are voting repeatedly.
[03:03:09.460 --> 03:03:12.980]  And just in the last election, I mean, Trump had a landslide.
[03:03:12.980 --> 03:03:13.980]  That's right.
[03:03:13.980 --> 03:03:19.260]  And we didn't realize that, you know, although Roy Moore had a huge splash controversy in
[03:03:19.260 --> 03:03:25.540]  the media, he really won, was horrible, we didn't realize how crazy the voter fraud was
[03:03:25.540 --> 03:03:26.540]  likely to be.
[03:03:26.540 --> 03:03:29.860]  Remember, the polls said he was going to lose by 15 to 10 points, then he lost by half a
[03:03:29.860 --> 03:03:30.860]  point.
[03:03:30.860 --> 03:03:33.420]  And there was just Democrats going, I came here from California to vote and screw him
[03:03:33.420 --> 03:03:34.420]  over.
[03:03:34.420 --> 03:03:35.420]  Oh, let's engage in fraud.
[03:03:35.420 --> 03:03:36.420]  Yeah.
[03:03:36.420 --> 03:03:37.420]  Rob, everybody.
[03:03:37.420 --> 03:03:38.420]  So I mean, they're just open about it.
[03:03:38.420 --> 03:03:39.420]  Yeah.
[03:03:39.420 --> 03:03:42.420]  And that's likely what we are going to see in the 20.
[03:03:42.420 --> 03:03:44.620]  No one votes illegally.
[03:03:44.620 --> 03:03:45.620]  No one votes illegally.
[03:03:45.620 --> 03:03:46.620]  Millie.
[03:03:46.620 --> 03:03:47.620]  That's never happened before.
[03:03:47.620 --> 03:03:48.620]  It's a conspiracy theory.
[03:03:48.620 --> 03:03:49.620]  We're going to engage in fraud.
[03:03:49.620 --> 03:03:50.620]  We're going to totally take over.
[03:03:50.620 --> 03:03:51.620]  You got all the Veritas videos.
[03:03:51.620 --> 03:03:52.620]  I mean, it's crazy.
[03:03:52.620 --> 03:03:53.620]  It is crazy.
[03:03:53.620 --> 03:03:57.380]  And meanwhile, a new book with Trump is a bunny rabbit.
[03:03:57.380 --> 03:04:00.940]  They're calling, they say I'm promoting a white nationalist book because the bunny rabbit
[03:04:00.940 --> 03:04:01.940]  has blonde hair.
[03:04:01.940 --> 03:04:02.940]  Oh my gosh.
[03:04:02.940 --> 03:04:07.100]  You talk about races against white people, man, but that's not even, it's white people
[03:04:07.100 --> 03:04:09.220]  putting it out saying whites are racist.
[03:04:09.220 --> 03:04:14.060]  And Michelle Obama has made many statements that people interpret as being racist against
[03:04:14.060 --> 03:04:15.140]  white people.
[03:04:15.140 --> 03:04:17.900]  But we're looking at the possibility here.
[03:04:17.900 --> 03:04:21.660]  Democrats are so familiar with the sound of Obama Biden.
[03:04:21.660 --> 03:04:24.060]  When they heard Biden Obama, it was instant.
[03:04:24.060 --> 03:04:25.060]  It's already out there.
[03:04:25.060 --> 03:04:26.060]  There's already been pulled out.
[03:04:26.060 --> 03:04:27.060]  Yes, we can.
[03:04:27.060 --> 03:04:28.060]  It's all Pavlovian idiocy.
[03:04:28.060 --> 03:04:29.060]  Yeah.
[03:04:29.060 --> 03:04:31.540]  And that's what we're going to see, Joe Obama, 2020.
[03:04:31.540 --> 03:04:41.340]  It's like, who's in the government, Joe Obama, Joe Obama, Joe Obama, Joe Obama, Joe Obama,
[03:04:41.340 --> 03:05:06.500]  Joe Obama, Joe Biden, Joe Biden, Joe Biden, Joe Biden, Joe Biden, Joe Biden, Joe Biden,
[03:05:06.500 --> 03:05:09.360]  Joe Biden, Joe Biden 2014.
[03:05:09.360 --> 03:05:14.340]  your cellular energy production by supporting mitochondria, much like a cellular engine
[03:05:14.340 --> 03:05:15.340]  overhaul.
[03:05:15.340 --> 03:05:19.860]  Because when your mitochondria don't run at 100% efficiency, then they start producing
[03:05:19.860 --> 03:05:22.300]  reactive oxygen species.
[03:05:22.300 --> 03:05:27.480]  Top scientists agree that aging is most likely caused by cellular damage, resulting from
[03:05:27.480 --> 03:05:30.380]  these reactive oxygen species.
[03:05:30.380 --> 03:05:35.420]  The antioxidants found in cell force are some of the most powerful available on the market.
[03:05:35.420 --> 03:05:40.260]  The stronger the antioxidant, the better its ability to scavenge for these reactive oxygen
[03:05:40.260 --> 03:05:42.780]  species and other free radicals.

[03:05:54.220 --> 03:06:07.860]  We've got it.
[03:06:07.860 --> 03:06:13.660]  Thanks for your space coming to you.
[03:06:13.660 --> 03:06:14.660]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:06:14.660 --> 03:06:15.660]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWars.
[03:06:15.660 --> 03:06:20.460]  At Cernovich on Twitter, Mike Cernovich taking over in this hour, author, researcher, investigative
[03:06:20.460 --> 03:06:25.620]  journalist, I want to hear what he's got laid out for us today, always breaking big news
[03:06:25.620 --> 03:06:26.620]  here.
[03:06:26.620 --> 03:06:27.620]  So much craziness going on.
[03:06:27.620 --> 03:06:32.900]  Fires at the Clinton's bedroom, at their house at the Secret Service, right there inside.
[03:06:32.900 --> 03:06:37.580]  You've got SpaceX launch and reports of super EMP weapons being deployed.
[03:06:37.580 --> 03:06:43.460]  We've got just North Korean War, not on the rise, but right up front right now.
[03:06:43.460 --> 03:06:47.300]  You've got Steve Bannon, and we've proud to support.
[03:06:47.300 --> 03:06:48.540]  It's been basically one way.
[03:06:48.540 --> 03:06:51.900]  You know, right where there's a lot of good stuff, I don't even think Cernovich's written
[03:06:51.900 --> 03:06:56.300]  some stuff for him, but the point is, now we see that going on.
[03:06:56.300 --> 03:06:57.500]  What a dumb move by Bannon, man.
[03:06:57.500 --> 03:07:01.860]  I tell you, because I thought he'd come out and say, I didn't say this, this guy's a known
[03:07:01.860 --> 03:07:05.900]  yellow journalism person, this wolf in the journalismist clothing.
[03:07:05.900 --> 03:07:10.940]  So Mike Cernovich, what do you have in your armory, in your arsenal for us today here in
[03:07:10.940 --> 03:07:12.460]  the information war?
[03:07:12.460 --> 03:07:17.380]  Yeah, the Bannon stuff is a very, very important development.
[03:07:17.380 --> 03:07:23.660]  By the way, there are so many timeless messages in there, and I really want, because for me,
[03:07:23.660 --> 03:07:30.060]  it's a very emotionally troubling experience, because I think highly a Bannon.
[03:07:30.060 --> 03:07:35.020]  Don Jr., however, is one of the greatest patriots in America, other than Trump Sr.
[03:07:35.020 --> 03:07:39.940]  I mean, the amount of abuse Don Jr. has linked to your stuff, to my stuff, retweeted Jack
[03:07:39.940 --> 03:07:45.140]  Pasobiec, retweeted Roger Stone, that guy just takes more abuse than anybody other than
[03:07:45.140 --> 03:07:46.140]  Don Sr.
[03:07:46.140 --> 03:07:52.220]  So the idea that anybody would insult Don Jr. is, of course, a very, very emotionally disturbing
[03:07:52.220 --> 03:07:56.140]  thing for me to find out, and then the idea that would have been Bannon would have made
[03:07:56.140 --> 03:07:57.140]  any sense.
[03:07:57.140 --> 03:07:59.860]  So I found out what happened.
[03:07:59.860 --> 03:08:04.460]  And Jonathan Swan of Axios already broke the story, so we'll give him the scoop for
[03:08:04.460 --> 03:08:05.460]  it.
[03:08:05.460 --> 03:08:06.460]  Let's turn it up.
[03:08:06.460 --> 03:08:07.700]  Yeah, so I tweeted that link out.
[03:08:07.700 --> 03:08:10.700]  So his rapport is actually 100% accurate.
[03:08:10.700 --> 03:08:14.020]  So Bannon did what you and I do.
[03:08:14.020 --> 03:08:17.540]  You and I have a habit, and this is why people can edit so much about us.
[03:08:17.540 --> 03:08:22.380]  We'll say, well, I can't believe he did that, because then they're going to be able to say
[03:08:22.380 --> 03:08:24.180]  Don Jr. is a traitor.
[03:08:24.180 --> 03:08:28.340]  Well, what they do is they clip out Don Jr. is a traitor, right?
[03:08:28.340 --> 03:08:29.660]  They don't go.
[03:08:29.660 --> 03:08:31.460]  Then they'll be able to say.
[03:08:31.460 --> 03:08:35.540]  So that's why there's all those weird videos about you out there, me out there, anybody,
[03:08:35.540 --> 03:08:37.380]  because they leave that part out.
[03:08:37.380 --> 03:08:40.380]  So that's what happened is Bannon wasn't himself.
[03:08:40.380 --> 03:08:43.100]  And by the way, Wolf was famous for this.
[03:08:43.100 --> 03:08:45.440]  But let's look at the big picture here.
[03:08:45.440 --> 03:08:46.440]  What are we seeing?
[03:08:46.440 --> 03:08:50.180]  We're seeing the Russia collusion narrative come to a close.
[03:08:50.180 --> 03:08:51.660]  So what do they have now?
[03:08:51.660 --> 03:08:54.380]  Oh, well, let's have this Bannon hit piece.
[03:08:54.380 --> 03:08:57.700]  Let's cause division within the Republican Trump base.
[03:08:57.700 --> 03:08:58.700]  Why?
[03:08:58.700 --> 03:09:03.020]  Because the Democrats are going full steam ahead for 2018 midterms.
[03:09:03.020 --> 03:09:08.740]  I totally agree, but I want to just ask him to finish that scene of your take on it, because
[03:09:08.740 --> 03:09:09.980]  I agree with what he's saying.
[03:09:09.980 --> 03:09:14.500]  It sounds like free form, and I kept saying Bannon respond, say it's out of context, say
[03:09:14.500 --> 03:09:15.500]  it's out of context.
[03:09:15.500 --> 03:09:18.380]  Then only says, oh, I love the president.
[03:09:18.380 --> 03:09:19.380]  That wasn't strong enough.
[03:09:19.380 --> 03:09:24.220]  So for me, that's when I went completely Captain Caveman, Mike Cernovich.
[03:09:24.220 --> 03:09:27.380]  Yeah, he he made a big mistake.
[03:09:27.380 --> 03:09:30.660]  Crisis management, you don't have hours.
[03:09:30.660 --> 03:09:35.060]  If I woke up and saw that people go, you know, Mike Cernovich insulted Alex Jones, I would
[03:09:35.060 --> 03:09:36.420]  be on Periscope in a second.
[03:09:36.420 --> 03:09:39.900]  And if they go, I bash Millie Weaver or Info Wars, I'd be like, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
[03:09:39.900 --> 03:09:43.580]  I wouldn't draft a statement and run it by lawyers and run it by a committee.
[03:09:43.580 --> 03:09:47.140]  I would just say, hey, I don't know what the heck is going on here, but I'm going to get
[03:09:47.140 --> 03:09:48.140]  the bottom of this right now.
[03:09:48.140 --> 03:09:49.380]  Yeah, this sounds like fake news.
[03:09:49.380 --> 03:09:50.380]  This guy misquoted me.
[03:09:50.380 --> 03:09:53.380]  You know, I was doing devil's advocate because that's what they do to me all the time.
[03:09:53.380 --> 03:09:58.060]  And Trump's come out on Twitter saying that there are blatant lies in this book saying
[03:09:58.060 --> 03:10:01.820]  that this guy went and had access to the White House and went there numerous times.
[03:10:01.820 --> 03:10:04.540]  And Trump even says on his Twitter, this is not true.
[03:10:04.540 --> 03:10:05.540]  He's never been at the White House.
[03:10:05.540 --> 03:10:08.500]  I actually made sure he wasn't allowed to be here.
[03:10:08.500 --> 03:10:13.300]  So I mean, this wolf guy by even liberal publications is known as really shifty.
[03:10:13.300 --> 03:10:15.300]  What's your intel on him?
[03:10:15.300 --> 03:10:16.300]  I'm Mike.
[03:10:16.300 --> 03:10:17.700]  Well, he, here's what he did.
[03:10:17.700 --> 03:10:19.740]  He softened everybody up.
[03:10:19.740 --> 03:10:26.540]  Back in November, 2016, he wrote a very flattering profile on Bannon, which the media, by the
[03:10:26.540 --> 03:10:27.540]  way, freaked out about.
[03:10:27.540 --> 03:10:31.260]  They go, how dare you remember he got that big exclusive with Bannon, how bad was this
[03:10:31.260 --> 03:10:32.260]  big architect?
[03:10:32.260 --> 03:10:33.260]  Yeah.
[03:10:33.260 --> 03:10:37.940]  So he did that big article in the Hollywood reporter, the media goes a crap on him and
[03:10:37.940 --> 03:10:40.780]  I can't believe you did that and blah, blah, blah.
[03:10:40.780 --> 03:10:44.620]  So he's softened being enough because here's the thing, Alex, we're all men.
[03:10:44.620 --> 03:10:46.060]  This is the Bannon's a Catholic.
[03:10:46.060 --> 03:10:47.500]  He should know this.
[03:10:47.500 --> 03:10:51.980]  He should know that the vanity and pride is a sin for a reason because that's how they
[03:10:51.980 --> 03:10:52.980]  get you.
[03:10:52.980 --> 03:10:54.500]  Pride goes before a fall.
[03:10:54.500 --> 03:10:55.500]  Yeah.
[03:10:55.500 --> 03:10:57.660]  People flatter me all the time to insult you.
[03:10:57.660 --> 03:11:01.020]  People are go, oh, you know, in the people, media people will be like, oh, yeah, you know,
[03:11:01.020 --> 03:11:03.060]  Washington posted this to me like a week ago.
[03:11:03.060 --> 03:11:05.980]  Oh, Cernovich, you know, you're too good.
[03:11:05.980 --> 03:11:06.980]  You're too good.
[03:11:06.980 --> 03:11:07.980]  I'm like, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[03:11:07.980 --> 03:11:08.980]  What are you talking about?
[03:11:08.980 --> 03:11:10.820]  Alex Jones is a patriot and American hero.
[03:11:10.820 --> 03:11:12.500]  But they'll seduce you.
[03:11:12.500 --> 03:11:16.100]  They'll say, oh, Alex, oh, Millie, what are you doing with that Cernovich guy?
[03:11:16.100 --> 03:11:20.100]  Just tell us that he's a bad guy, you know, and we'll give you that good press.
[03:11:20.100 --> 03:11:21.700]  We'll give you that good media.
[03:11:21.700 --> 03:11:23.580]  You won't wake up to more hip pieces.
[03:11:23.580 --> 03:11:25.260]  And that's how the media.
[03:11:25.260 --> 03:11:26.260]  They try to turn you.
[03:11:26.260 --> 03:11:27.260]  Oh, they do.
[03:11:27.260 --> 03:11:28.260]  Yeah.
[03:11:28.260 --> 03:11:29.260]  Absolutely.
[03:11:29.260 --> 03:11:33.940]  They seduce, so wolves seduced Bannon with that piece, which by the way, all credit to
[03:11:33.940 --> 03:11:34.940]  Wolf.
[03:11:34.940 --> 03:11:40.700]  I mean, we're in a war and this makes a lot of people angry sometimes because I call
[03:11:40.700 --> 03:11:43.300]  them more like a referee, like a journalist.
[03:11:43.300 --> 03:11:45.020]  And I give credit where it's due.
[03:11:45.020 --> 03:11:47.180]  The wolf got into the White House.
[03:11:47.180 --> 03:11:51.500]  Why they let the wolf in the White House, but because he ran game on him, he seduced
[03:11:51.500 --> 03:11:52.500]  them.
[03:11:52.500 --> 03:11:53.500]  He made them.
[03:11:53.500 --> 03:11:54.500]  Sure.
[03:11:54.500 --> 03:11:55.500]  He snuck in with Bannon and then Trump never saw him.
[03:11:55.500 --> 03:11:57.500]  So then he makes it like he had access.
[03:11:57.500 --> 03:11:58.500]  Total crap, Millie.
[03:11:58.500 --> 03:12:03.380]  But then again, if, you know, I really think that something more sinister with Bannon is
[03:12:03.380 --> 03:12:04.380]  going on.
[03:12:04.380 --> 03:12:08.180]  Like I liked Bannon and everything, but after really investigating and looking into this,
[03:12:08.180 --> 03:12:13.860]  I'm starting to say, hey, no, there's something not right here with Steve Bannon, even when
[03:12:13.860 --> 03:12:19.220]  Trump is tweeting out and Donald Trump, Jr. They're tweeting out that there were tons
[03:12:19.220 --> 03:12:24.860]  of stuff going on behind the scenes, lies and scandal and leaks that can be traced
[03:12:24.860 --> 03:12:26.020]  to Steve Bannon.
[03:12:26.020 --> 03:12:31.180]  So that goes to tell me, well, did Steve Bannon originally have to leave because he was causing
[03:12:31.180 --> 03:12:32.180]  so much?
[03:12:32.180 --> 03:12:33.340]  Well, let's get back to the Donald Jr. thing.
[03:12:33.340 --> 03:12:39.620]  The venom in, I'll crack you like an egg, just sounds like just like acting tough, like,
[03:12:39.620 --> 03:12:44.860]  you know, drooling over the president's son is an honorable, hard charger patriot, you
[03:12:44.860 --> 03:12:49.620]  know, drooling over that effect, certain of which is just really do it as a guy because
[03:12:49.620 --> 03:12:50.780]  I never really shed on there.
[03:12:50.780 --> 03:12:51.780]  That's what made me so mad.
[03:12:51.780 --> 03:12:55.820]  But it was that crack the egg venom, wanting to see somebody fall, wanting to see a patriot
[03:12:55.820 --> 03:12:57.700]  broken.
[03:12:57.700 --> 03:12:59.700]  It shows malice.
[03:12:59.700 --> 03:13:06.900]  Well, to me, it's always been very frustrating because there, you know, I have friends that
[03:13:06.900 --> 03:13:11.380]  work at Breitbart, so I'm going to be careful how I word this so that the people don't lie
[03:13:11.380 --> 03:13:12.420]  about what I'm saying.
[03:13:12.420 --> 03:13:16.180]  But how many favors has Breitbart done for you?
[03:13:16.180 --> 03:13:18.460]  You know, how many favors have they done for you?
[03:13:18.460 --> 03:13:20.940]  How much have they really done?
[03:13:20.940 --> 03:13:21.940]  Really nothing.
[03:13:21.940 --> 03:13:23.100]  You know, let's just be honest here.
[03:13:23.100 --> 03:13:27.980]  They've always viewed us as kind of the outcast and, oh, those are French people.
[03:13:27.980 --> 03:13:30.980]  Not realizing to the mainstream media, we're all French.
[03:13:30.980 --> 03:13:35.020]  To the mainstream media, Breitbart and NFL wars are one and the same, you know?
[03:13:35.020 --> 03:13:36.020]  So that was a problem.
[03:13:36.020 --> 03:13:38.860]  Well, it's a wannabe elitism.
[03:13:38.860 --> 03:13:44.180]  People always, they don't even understand the rock star effect of being the black sheep.
[03:13:44.180 --> 03:13:48.020]  The minute I became establishment, that's, the aura is gone.
[03:13:48.020 --> 03:13:50.660]  It's like Trump's the outsider and we're real.
[03:13:50.660 --> 03:13:54.860]  I could care less about red carpets and, oh, I've been invited to go talk to Ben and so
[03:13:54.860 --> 03:14:00.180]  I can like, you know, having brushes dandruff off on me and I'm, you know, sorry, go ahead.
[03:14:00.180 --> 03:14:06.300]  Well, that's the issue is they, Breitbart, you know, Breitbart, they made a lot of mistakes.
[03:14:06.300 --> 03:14:08.100]  They said, well, I don't want to be a French.
[03:14:08.100 --> 03:14:11.700]  I don't want to be French like NFL wars, which is wrong, but I'm just telling you that's
[03:14:11.700 --> 03:14:13.540]  what people think.
[03:14:13.540 --> 03:14:17.700]  And they got to realize that the media is never going to love us.
[03:14:17.700 --> 03:14:18.700]  Okay.
[03:14:18.700 --> 03:14:19.700]  We're never going to get that glowing profile.
[03:14:19.700 --> 03:14:24.580]  I was on a two hour Waco special on ABC last night, didn't even watch it.
[03:14:24.580 --> 03:14:25.580]  Yeah.
[03:14:25.580 --> 03:14:26.580]  Because you know what it's going to be.
[03:14:26.580 --> 03:14:29.340]  It's just going to be a hippie's same old lie.
[03:14:29.340 --> 03:14:34.660]  My point is I don't want to watch myself and I want to change the world.
[03:14:34.660 --> 03:14:39.580]  I mean, I look at one look at Brian Stelter and that fake smile of his and how disingenuous
[03:14:39.580 --> 03:14:40.580]  he is.
[03:14:40.580 --> 03:14:42.500]  He just makes me want to vomit.
[03:14:42.500 --> 03:14:44.100]  He makes me want to vomit.
[03:14:44.100 --> 03:14:50.860]  My service is he not the ultimate example of just a, a, a, a, the opposite of what a
[03:14:50.860 --> 03:14:51.860]  man is.
[03:14:51.860 --> 03:14:55.020]  Well, I posted a excerpt from his book.
[03:14:55.020 --> 03:14:58.100]  He said that all the women wanted to sleep with Matt Lauer.
[03:14:58.100 --> 03:15:02.820]  I don't know if we can pull that excerpt up, but on my true story, I'm like, he wrote
[03:15:02.820 --> 03:15:03.820]  this book on.
[03:15:03.820 --> 03:15:07.900]  It's like Sink Uggur says women are subhuman classic Islamic statement.
[03:15:07.900 --> 03:15:08.900]  Yeah.
[03:15:08.900 --> 03:15:11.900]  It's just a very fat, disgusting pig.
[03:15:11.900 --> 03:15:12.900]  Sorry.
[03:15:12.900 --> 03:15:13.900]  Go ahead.
[03:15:13.900 --> 03:15:17.660]  I don't know if I can find that excerpt where Brian Stelter said that Matt Lauer was like
[03:15:17.660 --> 03:15:18.660]  a sex icon.
[03:15:18.660 --> 03:15:22.060]  So I'm going to search my phone real quick while you guys talk and then I'll retweet
[03:15:22.060 --> 03:15:26.180]  it to the top of my timeline because he doesn't want anybody to know about this.
[03:15:26.180 --> 03:15:27.180]  Look at that.
[03:15:27.180 --> 03:15:31.660]  I mean, if you showed a group of kids his face and 10 other people's, they would say
[03:15:31.660 --> 03:15:32.980]  that's a bad man.
[03:15:32.980 --> 03:15:39.620]  I mean, that is, that is the poster boy of a sack of backstabbing garbage and smile
[03:15:39.620 --> 03:15:42.620]  looks like a smile of a chimpanzee before it invites you.
[03:15:42.620 --> 03:15:43.620]  Exactly.
[03:15:43.620 --> 03:15:44.620]  You know, it's nothing but malice.
[03:15:44.620 --> 03:15:45.620]  It's just anemone.
[03:15:45.620 --> 03:15:54.220]  Who the right backstab was?
[03:15:54.220 --> 03:15:55.220]  This is Dan Pilla.

[03:18:27.340 --> 03:18:32.380]  and I came up with our own formulae working with some scientists and developers, non-GMO
[03:18:32.380 --> 03:18:38.180]  made right here in America, 120 capsules and ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglinone

[03:19:57.980 --> 03:20:26.220]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[03:20:26.220 --> 03:20:42.660]  It's really important to note here that the Republican Party will kind of criticize just
[03:20:42.660 --> 03:20:47.980]  about any little thing and start infighting immediately within each other because we all
[03:20:47.980 --> 03:20:53.900]  kind of think objectively whereas if you notice the Democrat Party will actually loyally
[03:20:53.900 --> 03:20:59.980]  follow whoever it is that's their person be it Hillary Obama to a fault they're like
[03:20:59.980 --> 03:21:05.900]  a cult it's like they don't even have individual thought process to have criticism of their
[03:21:05.900 --> 03:21:10.060]  own party and that has led to their downfall and overly supporting Hillary Clinton when
[03:21:10.060 --> 03:21:13.660]  they shouldn't have to begin with but we also see the downfalls within the Republican
[03:21:13.660 --> 03:21:18.540]  Party where there's so much infighting all the time it's like can we just get it together
[03:21:18.540 --> 03:21:23.620]  so we can actually keep our president in office.
[03:21:23.620 --> 03:21:29.340]  Mike Sernovich I just can't believe that they're still attacking viciously as Trump and all
[03:21:29.340 --> 03:21:33.780]  of us together with God's help crush them and I just think they're crazy enough and
[03:21:33.780 --> 03:21:35.900]  they've been saying that they're gonna try to kill the president I really think that's
[03:21:35.900 --> 03:21:40.500]  where that's going I want to ask you that first and then look I knew there was some
[03:21:40.500 --> 03:21:46.260]  animosity between some of the Breitbart people at the top and some of the folks in the White
[03:21:46.260 --> 03:21:51.500]  House I tried to stay out of it because Bannon had a little bit more credibility as being
[03:21:51.500 --> 03:21:55.780]  a patriot you know he kind of just blew into town in the last few years and took over Breitbart
[03:21:55.780 --> 03:22:01.100]  after Breitbart mysteriously died so but so I just you know sat there and like five ten
[03:22:01.100 --> 03:22:06.100]  fifteen stories a day we linked to cover it boom boom boom for every hundred stories we
[03:22:06.100 --> 03:22:10.460]  linked to on them maybe one mention of us usually kind of a snipe and attack I mean
[03:22:10.460 --> 03:22:14.580]  even daily caller does that I don't freak out daily caller on a piece of tagging me fine
[03:22:14.580 --> 03:22:18.700]  knock me out baby let's go if you think we're not on the same team that's fine I'm not gonna
[03:22:18.700 --> 03:22:23.260]  stab you in the back but the now that if he stays on top of it with the Soros connections
[03:22:23.260 --> 03:22:28.460]  and the Chinese Communist connections and this crap you know I before the good of the
[03:22:28.460 --> 03:22:31.940]  country Breitbart has some great journals and great people and of course a great man founded
[03:22:31.940 --> 03:22:36.660]  it and Drudge breathed life into it let's give you know Drudge the credit for the Promethean
[03:22:36.660 --> 03:22:42.540]  fire that Drudge founded Breitbart okay that's what and help Breitbart and all nine yards
[03:22:42.540 --> 03:22:46.140]  Breitbart did a great job as well but let's just give credit where to because he sociopaths
[03:22:46.140 --> 03:22:50.020]  never want to give the credit you give the credit to know what's victory and what's working
[03:22:50.020 --> 03:22:53.900]  and to celebrate it I celebrate all these people I don't like seeing banners fall it
[03:22:53.900 --> 03:22:58.380]  makes me sick that's why I'm tired of it I'm tired of investing in people and having
[03:22:58.380 --> 03:23:03.620]  a crap all over us but you crap I'm sorry go ahead trees and it's really in fear and
[03:23:03.620 --> 03:23:07.740]  then they accuse us of treason where are the Americans you got it we're bringing the country
[03:23:07.740 --> 03:23:11.700]  back in the freedom back get out of the way you keep running your damn mouths you're gonna
[03:23:11.700 --> 03:23:16.900]  get war go ahead son of it sorry well the issue is that they all think they're better
[03:23:16.900 --> 03:23:21.420]  than us because friends of mine will text me and go you know that in DC the daily caller
[03:23:21.420 --> 03:23:25.460]  and the Breitbart people they're laughing at you and Alex they make funny why do you link
[03:23:25.460 --> 03:23:30.780]  to your their stuff and I go look keep me out of the drama I'm in it to win it I don't
[03:23:30.780 --> 03:23:36.620]  care of some little you know soy boy with 5,000 followers on Twitter oh cuz he works
[03:23:36.620 --> 03:23:40.860]  for the daily caller Breitbart oh you're such a real journalist but we're the fake journalist
[03:23:40.860 --> 03:23:46.140]  even though I can't go out in public without being exactly they join our enemies don't
[03:23:46.140 --> 03:23:52.140]  they understand dishonor is not what you want yeah they're sny they're jealous because we
[03:23:52.140 --> 03:23:56.740]  are the real celebrities were the famous people were the people have an impact so me I always
[03:23:56.740 --> 03:24:03.980]  tell people I don't care I will link to people who are throwing down fire on the enemy but
[03:24:03.980 --> 03:24:10.420]  dredge who did dredge light up on Christmas your website mine Christmas lights Matt dredge
[03:24:10.420 --> 03:24:17.900]  has never never and that's why Matt dredge is a winner he is the big man dad I mean so
[03:24:17.900 --> 03:24:23.340]  much of what we've done is because of dredge Matt just proven himself and he stayed loyal
[03:24:23.340 --> 03:24:28.500]  to the cause which remember the cause before even the Trump train and Trump movement the
[03:24:28.500 --> 03:24:34.220]  cause is the patriot movement that we originally started that you start well here's the deal
[03:24:34.220 --> 03:24:39.020]  dredge obviously knew that that that ban was bad news from when I saw the last six months
[03:24:39.020 --> 03:24:44.140]  and I he never gossips I wish he had told me you know that he just doesn't do it period
[03:24:44.140 --> 03:24:49.340]  I wish I'd have gotten more warnings about this Mike yeah well the issue is a lot of
[03:24:49.340 --> 03:24:55.300]  people don't understand the concept like derivative social status if you're relevant because of
[03:24:55.300 --> 03:24:59.980]  your association with somebody or just maybe you never played team sports protect the quarterback
[03:24:59.980 --> 03:25:05.700]  Trump's a quarterback no Mac offensive linemen wide receiver but you're a piece of crap if
[03:25:05.700 --> 03:25:10.500]  you don't do your job and the quarterback gets his knee broken and Ben even hurt Trump's
[03:25:10.500 --> 03:25:16.100]  image in the first place even putting Bannon in her Trump's image because they try to attach
[03:25:16.100 --> 03:25:22.340]  alt-right and and racist white supremacist with they say this bunny book is white supremacist
[03:25:22.340 --> 03:25:30.300]  a bunny book we sell because it's got a blonde bunny yeah well Bannon get to give the devil
[03:25:30.300 --> 03:25:35.660]  is do Bannon and Cambridge Analytica and all that stuff did really help with the swing
[03:25:35.660 --> 03:25:41.140]  states and again that's why for me it's such a troublesome position to be in because I
[03:25:41.140 --> 03:25:45.140]  have such emotional that's why I wish he had come out and said I was taken out of context
[03:25:45.140 --> 03:25:51.420]  what is he thinking meeting with that demon Mike sir Mike sir if it's do you think that
[03:25:51.420 --> 03:25:58.900]  Breitbart should get rid of Steve Bannon I think Steve Bannon rather than Breitbart get
[03:25:58.900 --> 03:26:03.780]  rid of him I think Bannon should go start his own media stuff he has his own money he
[03:26:03.780 --> 03:26:10.020]  has his own talent he has an interest exactly don't just live off you know the work of Andrew
[03:26:10.020 --> 03:26:13.780]  Breitbart let's see him he's such a big man he wants to be president how about he goes
[03:26:13.780 --> 03:26:19.380]  and builds a new dynamo media empire and shows us his stuff he didn't create it like Roger
[03:26:19.380 --> 03:26:23.340]  Ailes he didn't create it like Roger Ailes he didn't create it like Matt Drudge he didn't
[03:26:23.340 --> 03:26:27.100]  create it like Andrew Breitbart he didn't create it like Mike Cernovich or Alex Jones
[03:26:27.100 --> 03:26:33.500]  or Joseph Farrah or or or you know folks like Tucker Carlson he didn't create anything
[03:26:33.500 --> 03:26:38.380]  I'm sick of it yeah so that's what he needs to do that's what people go well because people
[03:26:38.380 --> 03:26:42.940]  go well you never bash Bannon and I said look man I just want to and this is what frustrates
[03:26:42.940 --> 03:26:47.980]  me about the whole thing I just want everybody to win even the people who don't like me even
[03:26:47.980 --> 03:26:52.100]  my haters even the losers I want everybody to get a bone no I agree but now that we know
[03:26:52.100 --> 03:26:58.020]  he's a big fat snake he's got to be dealt with it's like I just want and it's so frustrating
[03:26:58.020 --> 03:27:03.820]  to just watch people lose when we are entering a new golden era whether it's never been more
[03:27:03.820 --> 03:27:07.260]  opportunity exactly I wanted to be in my X-wing with Bannon right beside us and everybody
[03:27:07.260 --> 03:27:10.780]  else were blowing up the Death Star meanwhile not have with him like giving the codes to
[03:27:10.780 --> 03:27:16.700]  the enemy there's the codes you know meanwhile all this controversy is let is there to distract
[03:27:16.700 --> 03:27:21.740]  us from the fact that our economy is doing amazing our stock market is doing amazing
[03:27:21.740 --> 03:27:25.460]  Trump keeps trying to desperately tweet this out like hey and by the way we're not being
[03:27:25.460 --> 03:27:29.980]  cheerleaders this should be cheerleaders no it's right in Trump is fighting for his life
[03:27:29.980 --> 03:27:35.780]  to deliver to us exactly and and we are benefiting our country is benefiting and this is literally
[03:27:35.780 --> 03:27:41.020]  just to completely cover that up distract people from the fact that instead of our country
[03:27:41.020 --> 03:27:45.980]  are coming back our jobs coming back they are instead I'm looking at this wolf devil
[03:27:45.980 --> 03:27:50.500]  I'm sorry go ahead turn it well we might be the only we might be the only honest people
[03:27:50.500 --> 03:27:55.500]  in media because I remember when people said we all turned on Trump because we actually
[03:27:55.500 --> 03:27:59.740]  criticize him to help him be better and when he's doing amazing we praise him and people
[03:27:59.740 --> 03:28:03.060]  go oh you're just Trump cheerleaders it's like wait a minute you said four months ago we
[03:28:03.060 --> 03:28:07.900]  turned on him and we were anti-trump that's because we do real honest journalism here
[03:28:07.900 --> 03:28:11.980]  and we called out the bad and we praise the good and that's the way every journalist should
[03:28:11.980 --> 03:28:18.940]  be we're cheerleaders of America of our country of the idea of making America great again it's
[03:28:18.940 --> 03:28:23.100]  not about Trump Trump could go corrupt and fall to the wayside but there's still gonna

[03:34:07.740 --> 03:34:12.340]  seventy six will commence again if you try to take our president out and see I'm not even
[03:34:12.340 --> 03:34:15.780]  I'm not part of a secret society thing but it's like I told this big writer I said I'm
[03:34:15.780 --> 03:34:19.540]  kind of like a lot of us like the head of the Illuminati but not the evil Illuminati
[03:34:19.540 --> 03:34:23.420]  there's no secret groups there's no blood it's not about power it's not about satan it's
[03:34:23.420 --> 03:34:27.300]  it's illumination that god actually creates and they call themselves eliminated when christ
[03:34:27.300 --> 03:34:32.100]  is the real light the lucifer is the false light that's why the bible christ is the morning
[03:34:32.100 --> 03:34:37.740]  star but so is the lucifer oh it's the same thing no christ is the real morning star lucifer
[03:34:37.740 --> 03:34:42.140]  is trying to be the real morning star and people with the real esoteric stuff the leader
[03:34:42.140 --> 03:34:47.740]  of the jedi force well the point is the point is is that we launched the real revolution
[03:34:47.740 --> 03:34:52.780]  the real new atlantis and and then and then and this completely freaks out all the occultists
[03:34:52.780 --> 03:34:56.580]  want to talk about this because they know this and they don't want this known and you
[03:34:56.580 --> 03:35:01.660]  know who's a sith lord right george soros and what does he have plans he's more you know
[03:35:01.660 --> 03:35:07.380]  he's a super evil like goblin gremlin of the even bigger spiders behind that mike sternum
[03:35:07.380 --> 03:35:12.260]  but you want to comment on what I was just ranting about well I've always said and we've
[03:35:12.260 --> 03:35:18.580]  talked about this that we are in a different we're in a different era now within the other
[03:35:18.580 --> 03:35:24.860]  collective consciousness and that's why people so I'll give you an example this is gonna sound
[03:35:24.860 --> 03:35:30.340]  insane to people who don't understand the global brain theory of the world but I was
[03:35:30.340 --> 03:35:34.940]  asked by a very intelligent reporter and there are like three or four of them in america
[03:35:34.940 --> 03:35:40.740]  haha and she said she said how you know she goes why did you get into this whole politics
[03:35:40.740 --> 03:35:47.180]  stuff when I was really known as being a mindset expert is a lifestyle expert as something
[03:35:47.180 --> 03:35:52.180]  completely different and I said I was in Paris and I was walking around because I love to
[03:35:52.180 --> 03:35:56.260]  walk five ten miles a day especially when I'm exploring a new city and I was walking
[03:35:56.260 --> 03:36:02.820]  in Paris and the sun had just set and I saw a new stand and I saw nothing but yellow and
[03:36:02.820 --> 03:36:08.260]  I go what is this it was a node right well what I saw at a conscious level was that donald
[03:36:08.260 --> 03:36:14.300]  trump's face was on the cover of some peresian magazine maybe le monde and he was covering
[03:36:14.300 --> 03:36:19.300]  up the entire new stand and this was back when nobody said he had a chance to win a primary
[03:36:19.300 --> 03:36:24.980]  anything and I realized that was an energy network node the group mind already knew he
[03:36:24.980 --> 03:36:29.340]  was what we needed and was going to then push it through just like the big study came out
[03:36:29.340 --> 03:36:32.860]  a few days ago that people within an hour of you getting a bacteria or virus even though
[03:36:32.860 --> 03:36:37.860]  it's not replicated you're not really sick yet somehow you we just see the body's gone
[03:36:37.860 --> 03:36:42.780]  in defense mode and supercomputers can't tell it but we can because we are the real supercomputer
[03:36:42.780 --> 03:36:46.740]  we're just babies just now discovering it and the globalists know it's there they know
[03:36:46.740 --> 03:36:50.020]  good people have it the evil people shudder it they don't be evil you have to shudder
[03:36:50.020 --> 03:36:54.500]  yourself you have to give up a lot of your of your real potential that's why all the
[03:36:54.500 --> 03:36:58.900]  allegories the evil wizard is always crippled and evil and ugly and bad and has arms and
[03:36:58.900 --> 03:37:02.020]  limbs that have been hacked off because they have to give up their humanity like hitler
[03:37:02.020 --> 03:37:05.940]  being nerve gas repeatedly in world war one and surviving that that's like an archetype
[03:37:05.940 --> 03:37:09.980]  of it coming back from the dead which he did by the way repeatedly that's the archetype
[03:37:09.980 --> 03:37:12.820]  of these people that's what they worship it's like their Lazarus project we're getting
[03:37:12.820 --> 03:37:17.300]  into really sophisticated stuff here the point is is that I don't have to be in their fake
[03:37:17.300 --> 03:37:21.620]  Illuminati all my ancestors going back founding taxes found in the US and I'm going to get
[03:37:21.620 --> 03:37:25.220]  into all the people because it sounds like bragging but I couldn't even help it because
[03:37:25.220 --> 03:37:29.500]  that's the real chain that's the real spirit and if everybody else out there that loves
[03:37:29.500 --> 03:37:33.660]  liberty you search your background I guarantee you there's stuff like that there as well
[03:37:33.660 --> 03:37:40.980]  exactly you know it's it's in but it's in most every Americans blood to want to resist
[03:37:40.980 --> 03:37:45.980]  tyranny because most everyone came from other countries to escape tyranny that came here
[03:37:45.980 --> 03:37:50.460]  so it's just interesting to see that now we're at this point where we've got these big George
[03:37:50.460 --> 03:37:55.020]  Soros guys out there that want to try to do anything they can to keep us in place and
[03:37:55.020 --> 03:38:00.660]  what is George Soros have planned well on January 20th there's going to be another massive
[03:38:00.660 --> 03:38:06.980]  nationwide woman's March slash impeach Trump March so we can expect that we're going to
[03:38:06.980 --> 03:38:13.220]  see another huge character assault on President Trump just leading up to this March to invigorate
[03:38:13.220 --> 03:38:18.540]  and encourage the women to all go out there and how do you get women to march to be Islamist
[03:38:18.540 --> 03:38:23.620]  you you call it a women's March it's the sickest joke on the planet sorry go ahead so they're
[03:38:23.620 --> 03:38:27.700]  launching a new major counter offensive he's putting hundreds of millions in he put hundreds
[03:38:27.700 --> 03:38:31.900]  of millions just into the DC March and there's already they even are partnered up with this
[03:38:31.900 --> 03:38:36.940]  thing called rally bus which is essentially a charter bus that can connect people to rally
[03:38:36.940 --> 03:38:44.060]  rallies so it's for example you can go from Chicago to DC and this is essentially to mobilize
[03:38:44.060 --> 03:38:47.140]  and get these democrats and they give them food they give them liquor they give them
[03:38:47.140 --> 03:38:52.260]  everything who's funding it who's funding it they've met Soros funds the women's marches
[03:38:52.260 --> 03:38:57.940]  George Soros is funny he gave 186 million to just the one in DC yeah and this is going
[03:38:57.940 --> 03:39:02.780]  to be huge and we can already assume that we're going to see more from the whole hashtag
[03:39:02.780 --> 03:39:07.740]  need to glory all red front coming after Trump and again it's all about women and it's these
[03:39:07.740 --> 03:39:11.860]  leaderless women because there aren't powerful women leading them they're leading led into
[03:39:11.860 --> 03:39:17.140]  a trap I mean it's so painful Mike Cernovich yeah I know that that's exactly right we all
[03:39:17.140 --> 03:39:24.620]  see it you can all see it it's energy and that is why they have destroyed because our
[03:39:24.620 --> 03:39:29.860]  brains are drawn to energy that's why have you ever noticed you're walking down the sidewalk
[03:39:29.860 --> 03:39:33.860]  and you just suddenly veer left or you veer right and then you're like oh wait what was
[03:39:33.860 --> 03:39:39.780]  going on exactly there was like an energy portal and the Donald Trump magazine cover
[03:39:39.780 --> 03:39:45.860]  thing in Paris for me in 2015 when everybody said oh this is a joke that was actually plugging
[03:39:45.860 --> 03:39:51.300]  into a a node and that was plugging into a good no that's why when I say that Trump
[03:39:51.300 --> 03:39:57.780]  will be he's a historical figure and a figure of destiny you could plug into that likewise
[03:39:57.780 --> 03:40:03.020]  that it's like a stargate and likewise while backing right away I could feel it was real
[03:40:03.020 --> 03:40:08.420]  and the enemies hate only confirmed it and expanding on that because I'll have that sixth
[03:40:08.420 --> 03:40:15.220]  sense I feel the enemies breaking sorry Michael had well that's why they're trying to open
[03:40:15.220 --> 03:40:20.780]  up their own stargates their own pedophile satanic stuff you know yet you ever notice
[03:40:20.780 --> 03:40:26.900]  that they say oh quit talking about pedophile conspiracy theories but they're the ones who
[03:40:26.900 --> 03:40:32.140]  talk about it all the time that's because unconsciously they know that that is their
[03:40:32.140 --> 03:40:38.180]  stargate Hollywood was their node into the Satanism and the pedophilia and that's why
[03:40:38.180 --> 03:40:44.020]  they're so afraid and that's why people like Meryl Streep who praised Roman Polanski that's
[03:40:44.020 --> 03:40:49.020]  why she's trying to attack Ivanka and you think you're you're a Satanist right she is
[03:40:49.020 --> 03:40:56.140]  the one who cheered Roman Polanski they put them in a mind controlled trance so that literally
[03:40:56.140 --> 03:41:01.460]  they support their victimizers it's Stockholm syndrome let's be clear she said and that's
[03:41:01.460 --> 03:41:07.260]  why they're going to have Joe Biden creepy uncle Joe the creepiest person of all running
[03:41:07.260 --> 03:41:11.260]  for president he's literally gearing up and they're backing him and when I'm going out
[03:41:11.260 --> 03:41:15.340]  there on the street and talking to all these liberals out there they're like yeah Joe Biden
[03:41:15.340 --> 03:41:19.620]  yeah and they don't think anything about the the way people ask why did you grab all these
[03:41:19.620 --> 03:41:23.820]  women's breasts and kids right in front of you it's lesser magic if he can do it right
[03:41:23.820 --> 03:41:28.340]  in front of you that makes it even better and then these are all Deepa cultists ladies
[03:41:28.340 --> 03:41:32.380]  and gentlemen and they know all this stuff and they use it against you and your family
[03:41:32.380 --> 03:41:36.260]  and they got all their Harry Potter movies and stuff to trick your kids to get into it
[03:41:36.260 --> 03:41:40.180]  and it's not that it isn't real the point is you it's all dark side stuff you want to
[03:41:40.180 --> 03:41:44.940]  just go with God your intuition you know your gut what's right you don't want to be in these
[03:41:44.940 --> 03:41:51.060]  cults these are people that know about God's power but are trying to twist it on a smaller
[03:41:51.060 --> 03:41:56.260]  level because they are sick evil fallen people they know all about word play how to essentially
[03:41:56.260 --> 03:42:02.100]  cast spells using nlp put people in trance and and how to do it it's it's very hard to
[03:42:02.100 --> 03:42:07.660]  do it's very tricky even if you try to learn in in here from some of the people who have
[03:42:07.660 --> 03:42:11.980]  mastered these techniques it's but it only works on people that are in a near sleep state
[03:42:11.980 --> 03:42:16.100]  and that's what the tv's and all this stuff's about and we're here to break you out of the
[03:42:16.100 --> 03:42:19.700]  trance which I know you've done but other people need to and realize this is an epic
[03:42:19.700 --> 03:42:25.300]  war Mike Cernovich yeah this is the zombie state the zombie trance for example when
[03:42:25.300 --> 03:42:30.380]  I gave a talk at Columbia University there were people have in Tifa holding a sign that
[03:42:30.380 --> 03:42:35.420]  said no pedo bashing and a lot of people with no evidence by the way they they have their
[03:42:35.420 --> 03:42:40.620]  own false lie conspiracy theories claim that I planted it and I said well wait a minute
[03:42:40.620 --> 03:42:45.780]  you mean that in Tifa and the left are such mindless zombies they'll hold up anything
[03:42:45.780 --> 03:42:50.700]  that you give them that is a far more interesting point that they're making and that's what's

[03:48:19.540 --> 03:48:24.140]  and there's a paradox we're the very best broadcast this is one of the best you know
[03:48:24.140 --> 03:48:27.580]  we've had in six months i can everybody feels everybody sees it the truth is just sitting
[03:48:27.580 --> 03:48:34.060]  on all cylinders and and then i haven't plugged in like two hours because it's just so good
[03:48:34.060 --> 03:48:38.460]  i but if we don't do that we're not here they've written articles now across the country
[03:48:38.460 --> 03:48:44.700]  saying that thump the book a children's book about the sweet bunny donald trump is white
[03:48:44.700 --> 03:48:49.580]  supremacist okay and then it comes with a poster alex and thump the art of info wars
[03:48:49.580 --> 03:48:54.860]  which the artist had the number one uh new york times bestselling uh graphic novel last
[03:48:54.860 --> 03:48:58.140]  year clinton cash they they've made this new book they wanted to get me involved in it
[03:48:58.140 --> 03:49:01.900]  i did and they flipped out because they don't want us having contact with children it's
[03:49:01.900 --> 03:49:08.300]  all about them having the contact so feminist baby you know that's right jib i didn't
[03:49:08.300 --> 03:49:12.700]  so that's going on but listen now you're really fun this is getting the books the t-shirts
[03:49:12.700 --> 03:49:16.220]  the high quality supplements free shipping storewide it's about to end it's got to end
[03:49:16.220 --> 03:49:19.900]  and i've already sold out of the micho zx at the lower price there's a little bit left but
[03:49:19.900 --> 03:49:24.300]  it's going back to full price we're selling out of the colloidal silver so it's not 67% off anymore

[03:49:47.900 --> 03:49:52.300]  night eye that's about the end because it's about to sell out and so yes what we do is we sell it
[03:49:52.300 --> 03:49:56.380]  really low price and then when it's about gone and we know there's months till more comes in maybe
[03:49:57.260 --> 03:50:01.260]  then then we sell it still discounted but but closer to full price to fund ourselves and a lot
[03:50:01.260 --> 03:50:06.140]  of you go buy the products when it is uh closer to full price and thank you because it takes a lot
[03:50:06.140 --> 03:50:10.300]  of money to run this operation and uh you folks really came through last year they hit us they
[03:50:10.300 --> 03:50:15.260]  took a lot of sponsors they took us off google ads they threw the kitchen sink at me and i'm not
[03:50:15.260 --> 03:50:19.100]  whining i asked for it all and i'm gonna belly up and i'm gonna take my licks and you know what
[03:50:19.100 --> 03:50:23.900]  i've never been a you know sadomasochist but i don't i don't enjoy pain but this kind of pain
[03:50:23.900 --> 03:50:29.020]  i actually enjoy because i know it's it's it's the right thing and as they say uh uh pain is
[03:50:29.020 --> 03:50:33.580]  weakness leaving the body so i trust in god and so just thank you all for your support in four
[03:50:33.580 --> 03:50:38.780]  store dot com in four's life dot com or triple eight two five three three one three nine stock up on

[03:50:43.500 --> 03:50:47.420]  never seem to plug you seem to give money at all these different ribs to launch their own operations
[03:50:47.420 --> 03:50:51.420]  and that's that's how i see sirnevich the sociopaths don't get it and psychopaths because they're so
[03:50:51.420 --> 03:50:56.780]  greedy mike sirnevich is like a wrecking ball against the club list all i see is good work
[03:50:56.780 --> 03:51:01.100]  from him he's just out there beavering away promoting everybody and we see all the energy we
[03:51:01.100 --> 03:51:04.940]  get we send him energy and it's just we just synergistically get more powerful against the
[03:51:04.940 --> 03:51:10.140]  globalist which we need to do there we're under attack we need to up our mass our strength we need
[03:51:10.140 --> 03:51:15.660]  to combine together uh and move forward and these idiots don't get why we're successful they just
[03:51:15.660 --> 03:51:22.940]  don't get it mike well they don't understand spirituality they're not christians or uh muslims
[03:51:22.940 --> 03:51:29.500]  or jews or buddhists or anybody who try to plug into a greater force so i've always said that i am
[03:51:29.500 --> 03:51:36.060]  just a node in the collective consciousness and i'm trying to be a node emanating positive energy
[03:51:36.060 --> 03:51:41.820]  energy that builds people up energy that uplifts people and yeah yeah i don't i don't plug myself

[03:52:11.180 --> 03:52:16.780]  but january 20th we're going to have a professional comedian oan benjamin who was banned for being
[03:52:16.780 --> 03:52:21.180]  politically incorrect from uh hollywood level i was about to say stuff like this is important
[03:52:21.180 --> 03:52:25.340]  to celebrate our free speech exactly and to come together and say we're not just still standing
[03:52:25.340 --> 03:52:29.740]  we're winning uh how do folks go to that how do people find out about it yeah so the website is
[03:52:29.740 --> 03:52:35.100]  a night for freedom dot com and you could just click on that and buy tickets uh that's a double
[03:52:35.100 --> 03:52:41.740]  meaning because we are nights for freedom exactly the k the k exactly and and that's what i tell people
[03:52:41.740 --> 03:52:48.700]  is look nobody's attacked more than all of us but we are winning and that's why they're attacking us
[03:52:48.700 --> 03:52:54.060]  i have the raw child family going after me now sharing fabricated videos and audios and stuff
[03:52:54.060 --> 03:52:58.780]  about me that that's the level that we're playing at now where the raw childs who are friends with
[03:52:58.780 --> 03:53:02.860]  jeffrey upstream bill clinton and we've got to realize that i'm under attack by the same folks
[03:53:02.860 --> 03:53:07.580]  and that's i'm not ready to get into it yet but it's incredible and and and what's amazing is
[03:53:08.140 --> 03:53:13.740]  they will literally go after everybody around you literally tried to pay them you name it i mean
[03:53:13.740 --> 03:53:19.180]  this is an intelligence war and i'm not an intelligence agency mike cernovich isn't uh uh
[03:53:19.180 --> 03:53:25.100]  yeah it's but but we're in a james bond movie it is and the stuff that we witness we experience
[03:53:25.100 --> 03:53:31.980]  everything is really intense because we are playing the game we're in the field we're in the field
[03:53:31.980 --> 03:53:36.220]  we're in the field we're chasing them around in the arena we're in the arena that's right
[03:53:36.220 --> 03:53:40.780]  we're in the arena but we're not gonna hide and that's the point and this is the point that
[03:53:40.780 --> 03:53:46.060]  bannon missed even though again i want to be clear i like him right gotta show your face
[03:53:47.020 --> 03:53:51.740]  you can't let the enemy think that they've got you beat down and bannon i don't know where he is
[03:53:51.740 --> 03:53:55.580]  he needs to get out there he needs to have events he needs to have this that's why we're doing a night
[03:53:55.580 --> 03:54:00.380]  for freedom where you can get take us to the night for freedom commas we know we're under attack we
[03:54:00.380 --> 03:54:07.740]  don't care we're gonna show you are reclusive yeah well i tend to be reclusive only because you can
[03:54:07.740 --> 03:54:12.460]  do more digitally but it is important to get together and do events well it's been an amazing
[03:54:12.460 --> 03:54:17.340]  transmission so far uh i mean we were telling folks about the special report you put out uh
[03:54:17.340 --> 03:54:23.980]  jobama 2020 to rival trump it's on info wars dot com news wars dot com uh other tidbits mike cernovich
[03:54:23.980 --> 03:54:31.180]  other other little schnibblets of information so basically as far as this jobama report like i
[03:54:31.180 --> 03:54:36.700]  said i didn't invent the term jobama this is out there uh this is what the democrats are promoting
[03:54:36.700 --> 03:54:42.620]  and the lack of hesitation in these liberals when i asked them about michelle obama was frightening
[03:54:42.620 --> 03:54:51.500]  most of them want michelle obama a lot of them do want to support jobama and what would they love
[03:54:51.500 --> 03:54:57.260]  more than to come into office and undo everything that president trump has done to try to protect
[03:54:57.260 --> 03:55:02.060]  obama's legacy and it makes it so easy you don't have to think about being involved just i'm for
[03:55:02.060 --> 03:55:07.980]  hillary i'm for obama i'm for i'm for michelle it's just so easy it's everything's everything's
[03:55:07.980 --> 03:55:12.620]  happy oh i love communism you know i'm walking out of the barbeque place you know and i got a cell
[03:55:12.620 --> 03:55:19.180]  phone everything i'm sorry mike no no that's exactly right they're they're completely losing
[03:55:19.180 --> 03:55:24.780]  their minds and that is why when the harder they attack the more transmissions you do you got to
[03:55:24.780 --> 03:55:30.860]  remember everybody listening the greatest act of rebellion in america today is to share a link
[03:55:30.860 --> 03:55:37.980]  to alex jones to milley to owen to roger stone to mike cernovich that is the true act of rebellion
[03:55:37.980 --> 03:55:44.940]  we are the new pamphleteers we are in 1776 2017 by the way is also numerically significant maybe
[03:55:44.940 --> 03:55:50.460]  we'll talk about that in another time go ahead talk about it and so again the ones in the sevens
[03:55:51.340 --> 03:55:58.860]  shows the rebirth a new era just like in 1776 and that's why everybody felt it was changing
[03:55:58.860 --> 03:56:03.740]  last year that's why everybody could tell that we're going into a golden era we're going into a
[03:56:03.740 --> 03:56:09.100]  time of prosperity and that was a significant seven and now we're rolling in to the new golden
[03:56:09.100 --> 03:56:14.700]  era the new age of prosperity but that means that the pedophiles the satanist the goblins the
[03:56:14.700 --> 03:56:19.820]  orcs the evil creatures the soros types and they have to come out even stronger because they want
[03:56:19.820 --> 03:56:26.140]  to return us into a dark age so that's why people if you're a patriot you feel conflicted you feel
[03:56:26.140 --> 03:56:31.420]  optimistic you you see that you're getting more money in a paycheck you see everybody's still there
[03:56:31.420 --> 03:56:35.580]  and they're freaking out the sunlight's baking them and it'd be clear this golden era i agree is
[03:56:35.580 --> 03:56:40.460]  coming in is us getting ready to face the ai and the big super threats where we're going to look back
[03:56:40.460 --> 03:56:44.460]  on these little demons and think man they were nothing compared to this so this is god giving
[03:56:44.460 --> 03:56:49.980]  us a respite this is our chance we need to take it this is our chance to take our country our freedom
[03:56:49.980 --> 03:56:54.860]  and the the weapons the eugenics everything that they have going on the fact that now they're spraying

[03:56:59.820 --> 03:57:05.260]  on our food the eugenics is up and they admit it all they spray viruses on the meat exactly and this
