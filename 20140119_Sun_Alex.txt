[00:00.000 --> 00:12.360]  We are on the march the Empire is on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[00:20.680 --> 00:23.680]  I'll be honest with you when you're informed
[00:23.680 --> 00:29.440]  if you turn off the area of your conscience that's concerned with the
[00:29.440 --> 00:34.320]  general welfare in the future of this planet and humanity on it then the
[00:34.320 --> 00:41.040]  government and its different speeches that the different deceivers put out
[00:41.040 --> 00:47.400]  like Obama last Friday dealing with the NSA are really incredible unintentional
[00:47.400 --> 00:52.560]  comedy comparing the NSA to your neighbor next door and how great they
[00:52.560 --> 01:00.440]  are or comparing the National Security Agency to Paul Revere that is really
[01:00.440 --> 01:04.560]  rich stuff because they were actually mad about the British getting into their
[01:04.560 --> 01:09.400]  privacy and reading their mail and searching houses without warrants that
[01:09.400 --> 01:14.480]  was one of the big beefs of the Revolutionary War and to arms to arms
[01:14.480 --> 01:18.080]  the the redcoats are coming
[01:18.080 --> 01:26.800]  Mandrake get over there and feed me that belt boy aka Allah Dr. Strangelove
[01:26.800 --> 01:31.800]  these are people that are the antithesis of our Republic that are demonizing the
[01:31.800 --> 01:36.760]  Bill of Rights and Constitution openly bad-mouthing the Founding Fathers and
[01:36.760 --> 01:41.200]  Army manuals openly bad-mouthing mainline Christians in fact guys people
[01:41.200 --> 01:48.200]  won't believe it we print me or pull up Fort Hood Christians listed as terrorist
[01:48.200 --> 01:52.920]  in the training manuals and also a Founding Fathers demonized and by
[01:52.920 --> 01:57.760]  Pentagon I mean I just want to show people Forbes and Reuters and AP so you
[01:57.760 --> 02:02.800]  understand the people running things hate Paul Revere they hate individuals
[02:02.800 --> 02:06.880]  that are empowered with the spirit of Liberty that's why Friday we had that
[02:06.880 --> 02:10.880]  big report that I saw drudge drudge report calm retweeted in fact we pull
[02:10.880 --> 02:14.080]  it out of the stack I got here late today only 30 minutes for broadcast I
[02:14.080 --> 02:17.000]  forgot a lot of stuff I wanted to get I want to I want to show people that
[02:17.000 --> 02:21.560]  article again about the big globalist think tank that advises the National
[02:21.560 --> 02:26.040]  Security Council saying we need a giant terror attack or crisis in America to go
[02:26.040 --> 02:30.200]  after our enemy and that is empowered individuals that don't like big
[02:30.200 --> 02:33.520]  government and they admitted in the article that we're defeating them and
[02:33.520 --> 02:37.800]  then we are the resistance of course already knew that but it's just
[02:37.800 --> 02:40.920]  incredible that this is a big presence key Hillary Clinton and all these others
[02:40.920 --> 02:45.240]  openly saying this and cast Sunstein openly saying this at the White House
[02:45.240 --> 02:49.160]  because I know it intellectually but it's a whole other thing entirely to
[02:49.160 --> 02:53.160]  actually see them admitting it and to know they're really that weak and
[02:53.160 --> 02:56.760]  pathetic I mean if they're worried about little old Alex Jones or world net
[02:56.760 --> 03:03.400]  daily or the drudge report which are big sites giant sites but still these are
[03:03.400 --> 03:05.720]  the globalists with the nuclear weapons these are the globalists with the
[03:05.720 --> 03:09.800]  biggest military in history the truth is they are so illegitimate such frauds
[03:09.800 --> 03:14.760]  they know their inches away from being arrested if we start talking about how
[03:14.760 --> 03:20.840]  they're scary tyrants the only answer is arrest them like senator Ted Cruz has
[03:20.840 --> 03:26.600]  done two weeks ago that has them spinning in their spiritual graves they're still
[03:26.600 --> 03:31.320]  alive but spiritually they're dead they are freaking out right now over the fact
[03:31.320 --> 03:36.080]  that we might actually call it like it is we might actually call it for what it
[03:36.080 --> 03:45.880]  is 200 proof tyranny in our face in a big fat gigantic way so we're going to go
[03:45.880 --> 03:50.480]  to break and I'm gonna go dig into the stack from Friday's broadcast I'm gonna
[03:50.480 --> 03:57.000]  pull out that article that deals with the globalist calling for a massive
[03:57.000 --> 04:01.640]  stage event so that they can continue their new world order headline think
[04:01.640 --> 04:05.080]  tank extraordinary crisis needed to preserve the new world order and I
[04:05.080 --> 04:08.240]  think we need to you know dissect what's going on in the news there's a lot of it
[04:08.240 --> 04:13.920]  ever gonna break it all down but also talk about the big issue and that is that
[04:13.920 --> 04:17.200]  it's like a train wreck that's about to happen everything we've seen is only a
[04:17.200 --> 04:22.520]  build-up towards this global crises financial meltdowns you name it and all
[04:22.520 --> 04:28.160]  the government control and crackdowns that come with it so ahead of going over
[04:28.160 --> 04:31.320]  the edge we've already gone over the edge but it's kind of a gradual slide
[04:31.320 --> 04:35.600]  but we're about to go over the big edge the next big drop we need to really
[04:35.600 --> 04:41.080]  maximize our visibility out there Liberty lovers everywhere to discredit the
[04:41.080 --> 04:45.000]  establishment ahead of whatever moves they're going to make so that when they
[04:45.000 --> 04:49.280]  make their move we catch them with their pants down we've already caught them
[04:49.280 --> 04:52.400]  with their pants down but we want to tie it knots around their ankles and
[04:52.400 --> 04:57.800]  collectively give them an uppercut right to the chin and break off their teeth
[04:57.800 --> 05:03.320]  in the last 50 years iodine has been phased out of our staple foods and
[05:03.320 --> 05:08.520]  replaced with the halogen bromine a practice now banned in nations around
[05:08.520 --> 05:12.600]  the world guess what else is in a halogen family fluoride ladies and
[05:12.600 --> 05:17.240]  gentlemen Alex Jones here in 1924 the federal government did the right thing
[05:17.240 --> 05:22.640]  and encouraged salt producers to add iodine it's the good halogen on the
[05:22.640 --> 05:27.720]  periodic table and the results are on record reports documented a 15-point
[05:27.720 --> 05:31.720]  IQ increase in areas that had previously been deficient in iodine
[05:31.720 --> 05:38.320]  bottom line iodine is important unbound clean in a glycerin base nascent iodine
[05:38.320 --> 05:42.720]  was the answer for myself and my family you will find survival shield nascent

[06:06.640 --> 06:12.400]  resistance you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[06:12.400 --> 06:15.400]  hey
[06:34.040 --> 06:39.320]  ladies and gentlemen I am your host Alex Jones we are broadcasting
[06:39.320 --> 06:48.680]  worldwide on this live Sunday edition the 19th day of January 2014 again thank
[06:48.680 --> 06:53.720]  you so much for joining us today obviously we're gonna continue as we did
[06:53.720 --> 06:59.040]  on the Friday weekday show 11 to 2 breaking down Obama's Friday NSA
[06:59.040 --> 07:06.960]  speech that is an even bigger whopper to the past lies that he has told on
[07:06.960 --> 07:11.760]  everything from the Second Amendment to open borders to energy to you can keep
[07:11.760 --> 07:16.680]  your doctor it's a lie that you'll lose your doctor it's a lie that your your
[07:16.680 --> 07:20.880]  bills will go up under Obamacare they will go down to the cost of a phone or
[07:20.880 --> 07:26.640]  cable bill well maybe if it's the cable bill for an entire 100 room hotel maybe
[07:26.640 --> 07:31.040]  that'll be your monthly cost I mean these are asinine lies there are no
[07:31.040 --> 07:34.560]  death panels of course there were death panels in the bill and they now admit
[07:34.560 --> 07:40.800]  there are death panels in the law and but don't worry he will decide what to
[07:40.800 --> 07:44.960]  implement outside of law and Congress has said okay the Republican leadership
[07:44.960 --> 07:48.800]  okay you go ahead and decide what to do and you go ahead and decide what to do
[07:48.800 --> 07:52.680]  on the NSA that you are promoting and you go ahead and decide what to do on
[07:52.680 --> 07:56.120]  borders and you go ahead and decide what to do on illegal aliens and you go ahead
[07:56.120 --> 08:01.680]  and decide what to do on war and just you know what you run everything and then
[08:01.680 --> 08:08.440]  if Rand Paul or Ted Cruz or Congressman Walter Jones or Congressman Amash or
[08:08.440 --> 08:14.920]  anybody else dares point out that this is called dictatorship well then you
[08:14.920 --> 08:19.440]  come out and attack them if Senator Cruz calls it frightening and dangerous
[08:19.440 --> 08:24.920]  Obama is frightening and dangerous acting a dictatorial well of course it's
[08:24.920 --> 08:32.480]  frightening and dangerous he went on to say terrifying yes it's terrifying to
[08:32.480 --> 08:38.440]  any constitutional lawyer who isn't joining with Sauron aka the one-eyed
[08:38.440 --> 08:45.280]  New World Order all-seeing pyramid I mean it's really that simple because when
[08:45.280 --> 08:49.000]  you get into a situation like this there's no checks and balances and the
[08:49.000 --> 08:53.200]  special interests that are in control through the executive dictatorship that
[08:53.200 --> 08:58.760]  presidents will come and go but it will now be a dictatorial executive
[08:58.760 --> 09:02.400]  Katie bar the door because those special interests will lay waste to
[09:02.400 --> 09:08.760]  everything will rob everything will destroy competition we'll get rid of
[09:08.760 --> 09:13.080]  you know any regulation that actually controls them while writing regulation to
[09:13.080 --> 09:18.400]  shut down their competition this is serious historically what's happening
[09:18.400 --> 09:22.320]  100% of the time when countries start going this direction if you do not
[09:22.320 --> 09:28.760]  reverse it if the pure unitary executive comes in you have absolute destruction
[09:28.760 --> 09:35.040]  of the standard of living and secret prisons torture mass breakdown of
[09:35.040 --> 09:40.440]  society and I do not really want to see this happen now if you look at the
[09:40.440 --> 09:43.680]  special interests that have really hijacked this country since 1913 by
[09:43.680 --> 09:48.960]  the 60s they really corrupted the CIA NSA and other agencies that they had big
[09:48.960 --> 09:52.640]  problems before but they were a lot more moral I've studied the history in depth
[09:52.640 --> 10:01.000]  but by the 60s especially mid 60s they stopped funding truly democratic free
[10:01.000 --> 10:06.840]  altruistic uplifting governments worldwide overthrow of dictators and the
[10:06.840 --> 10:12.720]  special forces credo was free the oppressed defend the oppressed translated
[10:12.720 --> 10:20.360]  from Latin to really putting in dictators and autocratic regimes wherever
[10:20.360 --> 10:25.680]  they could and overthrowing democratic regimes that were pro-america in fact I
[10:25.680 --> 10:31.960]  say it started in the 60s in 53 the grandson of Teddy Roosevelt Kermit
[10:31.960 --> 10:36.400]  Roosevelt he wrote a best-selling book in 99 before he died on it they got real
[10:36.400 --> 10:40.280]  angry at him almost arrested him but then four years ago declassified that the
[10:40.280 --> 10:45.360]  book was a hundred percent accurate that an operation Ajax they staged terror
[10:45.360 --> 10:53.520]  attacks all over what is Iran today and hired radical Muslim groups to blow
[10:53.520 --> 10:57.480]  stuff up and then blamed it on the president even though he was secular
[10:57.480 --> 11:01.600]  claiming he was behind it then had a counter-crew coup against the Muslim
[11:01.600 --> 11:05.480]  extremist that they tried to put in power and use that to throw moza deck
[11:05.480 --> 11:11.960]  out so it was like a triple false flag stage deal that's declassified and and
[11:11.960 --> 11:16.680]  that was a poet trained in the West pro-america pro women going to college
[11:16.680 --> 11:22.560]  pro basically arresting radical Muslims that were trying to overthrow the
[11:22.560 --> 11:25.800]  country and so they just came in and told the radical Muslims we're gonna put
[11:25.800 --> 11:28.920]  you in charge and had them blow everything up and then claim to moza
[11:28.920 --> 11:35.440]  deck was with them in a double cross and then over through the country so one
[11:35.440 --> 11:40.080]  I'm trying to say here is the people running this nation today since the
[11:40.080 --> 11:46.920]  mid-60s do not want to put good people in charge in fact our own CIA this is
[11:46.920 --> 11:51.880]  declassified more than 20 years ago funded Fidel Castro in the late 50s and
[11:51.880 --> 11:57.080]  put him in as the rebel leader to bring in a socialist system where the rich
[11:57.080 --> 12:00.480]  could still live there but but redistribute some of the wealth and get
[12:00.480 --> 12:04.720]  rid of Batista he double crossed them and decided to go with the Soviets and
[12:04.720 --> 12:09.600]  pure communism so the rest is history so as Carol quickly wrote in the mid 60s
[12:09.600 --> 12:12.560]  and tragedy and hope as they had a political science at Georgetown Bill
[12:12.560 --> 12:17.560]  Clinton's mentor at the time they fund communist socialist fascist flat-out
[12:17.560 --> 12:25.200]  dictators autocrats they don't care they want dictatorial command and control
[12:25.200 --> 12:31.240]  governments that make the public poor on purpose to make you pliable and
[12:31.240 --> 12:35.960]  controllable and dependent for social engineering they want dumbing down the
[12:35.960 --> 12:39.880]  schooling they want lowering of IQs chemically this is all the official
[12:39.880 --> 12:43.600]  policy of the White House science are in his book eco science it's free online
[12:43.600 --> 12:49.840]  go read it it's 1100 pages go read it you can skip ahead in them to you know
[12:49.840 --> 12:54.120]  adding things to the water to sterilize you and dumb you down which they do so
[12:54.120 --> 12:57.760]  your IQs lower and you're dumbed down even if you're upset about this you're
[12:57.760 --> 13:01.320]  so conditioned chemically you can't get upset a lot of you understand I just
[13:01.320 --> 13:04.800]  plus football zone I mean it's a lot more fun I mean who wants to hear some
[13:04.800 --> 13:09.760]  guy on the air you know who gives you actual facts and things it's scary so
[13:09.760 --> 13:16.160]  so just deny it so Obama came out Friday and I did a video analyzing it that's
[13:16.160 --> 13:21.240]  up on info wars calm that has the headline Obama a scared he'll be
[13:21.240 --> 13:26.560]  arrested and that's why he is let me give you the exact headline here I'm
[13:26.560 --> 13:30.720]  one from memory Obama fears arrest and is running scared from NSA scandal and
[13:30.720 --> 13:34.440]  it's from the nightly news and analysis I did for Friday nights nightly news I
[13:34.440 --> 13:38.160]  think I'm gonna air that at the start of the next segment and then throughout the
[13:38.160 --> 13:41.040]  week this week on the weekday show and today I'm gonna play the clip where he
[13:41.040 --> 13:49.240]  said Paul Revere would be proud of the NSA that's like saying that a rabbi would
[13:49.240 --> 13:57.440]  be proud of Hitler and then he went on or or let me think of something your
[13:57.440 --> 14:02.680]  Superman would be proud of lax Luther whatever his name is I mean it's just
[14:02.680 --> 14:07.840]  absolutely a fraud one of the main reason we had the Revolutionary War was
[14:07.840 --> 14:10.440]  because the British were coming in houses without warrants and searching
[14:10.440 --> 14:13.960]  they were interdicting mail and private mail deliveries and reading it without
[14:13.960 --> 14:17.160]  warrants the violated Magna Carta and a bunch of other British laws these were
[14:17.160 --> 14:21.360]  Englishmen who had British British rights they already had a bunch of wars
[14:21.360 --> 14:25.560]  in England over what our bill of rights became here that's why almost well first
[14:25.560 --> 14:29.040]  the majority of the British were for the colonies they had a vote to not have
[14:29.040 --> 14:33.520]  war until the King of England went and ordered them in Parliament King George
[14:33.520 --> 14:38.240]  the third to launch the attack so it wasn't like all the British were for
[14:38.240 --> 14:42.600]  attacking the colonies as well they were concerned about people that were
[14:42.600 --> 14:47.360]  Englishmen in the 13 colonies predominantly English and Dutch and German
[14:47.360 --> 14:52.160]  being completely and totally overrun they'd had wars in in the Netherlands
[14:52.160 --> 14:56.200]  over basic liberty they'd had wars in Germany over basic liberty this was the
[14:56.200 --> 14:59.520]  age of enlightenment this was the age of the you know the golden age of the of
[14:59.520 --> 15:02.800]  the Renaissance have been going on for 300 years at that time it started in
[15:02.800 --> 15:08.680]  1500 roughly 1550 you can really market but the point is 300 years after that
[15:08.680 --> 15:13.200]  you've got this search for liberty going on you have in 1600 the colonies
[15:13.200 --> 15:18.560]  being founded roughly and and and people are upset and so they were
[15:18.560 --> 15:22.320]  diametrically angry about attempts to take their guns attempts to brainwash
[15:22.320 --> 15:26.120]  their kids and government-run schools attempts to have state-run religion they
[15:26.120 --> 15:30.480]  were angry about attempts to enslave them and surveil them I mean that's why
[15:30.480 --> 15:34.560]  we have a fourth amendment and and other amendments about search and seizure and
[15:34.560 --> 15:40.760]  so Obama says raping your bill of rights is what Paul Revere would do this is
[15:40.760 --> 15:48.720]  like saying vampires are friends of Von Helsing you know Von Helsing is Paul
[15:48.720 --> 15:52.200]  Revere Obama's a vampire and he's saying Von Helsing endorses
[15:52.200 --> 15:57.800]  counter-acculent I mean it's just polar opposite 180 degree lie total fraud
[15:57.800 --> 16:03.360]  unbelievable Alex Jones here with a message to fellow freedom lovers the
[16:03.360 --> 16:07.960]  prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse
[16:07.960 --> 16:13.600]  the globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until
[16:13.600 --> 16:16.680]  they acquiesce to the global takeover that's why we've assembled the most

[21:47.160 --> 21:51.880]  need them so they can roll out an authoritarian state and that's why the
[21:51.880 --> 21:57.320]  West finances terrorist groups protects terrorist groups and allows terrorist
[21:57.320 --> 22:02.200]  groups to attack or in some cases fully stages the attacks themselves as false

[22:13.320 --> 22:17.480]  declassified examples of stage terror and here's the article from Friday
[22:17.480 --> 22:26.440]  think tank extraordinary crisis needed to preserve new world order author of
[22:26.440 --> 22:30.320]  shotgun on doctrine says elite threatened by non-state actors like Edward
[22:30.320 --> 22:33.720]  Snowden and I'm not going to replay you Brazinski saying this like we did
[22:33.720 --> 22:37.960]  Friday or Hillary Clinton saying we're losing the info war against alternative
[22:37.960 --> 22:42.680]  empowered libertarian media or the Pentagon saying that three months ago I
[22:42.680 --> 22:45.840]  played all that Friday I just want to point you to this article because
[22:45.840 --> 22:49.720]  writing for the Atlantic Council a prominent it's more than prominent it
[22:49.720 --> 22:56.720]  is a paramount think tank based in Washington DC Harlan K. Olman warns
[22:56.720 --> 23:00.280]  that an extraordinary crisis quote is needed to preserve the quote new world
[23:00.280 --> 23:03.920]  order which is under threat from being derailed by non-state actors like Edward
[23:03.920 --> 23:11.240]  Snowden and other empowered individuals that have discredited global
[23:11.240 --> 23:14.080]  governance in the state you got to go read these quotes you got to go read his
[23:14.080 --> 23:19.560]  paper this is the guy that that advises the Security Council which runs the
[23:19.560 --> 23:23.200]  government you know you think of the president he's a puppet but his office
[23:23.200 --> 23:27.120]  has become dictatorial it is the National Security Council that runs COG
[23:27.120 --> 23:31.560]  continuity government and during any type of civil emergency or staged event
[23:31.560 --> 23:36.440]  nuclear war asteroid you name it real or manufactured these guys take over
[23:36.440 --> 23:43.920]  Congress for six months to a year has no power totally unconstitutional and
[23:43.920 --> 23:48.040]  bush signed an executive order and a PDD a year before he left office that
[23:48.040 --> 23:54.760]  Obama continued saying that for a civil emergency financial emergency or you
[23:54.760 --> 23:59.120]  can look this up in fact I'll remember during the next break the PDD number and
[23:59.120 --> 24:02.680]  pull it up guys type in bush signs executive order suspending Congress
[24:02.680 --> 24:08.800]  during emergency and then it'll pop up I forget the PDD number and the executive
[24:08.800 --> 24:12.640]  order number I mean I'm not perfect the point is is Obama the first thing he did
[24:12.640 --> 24:16.360]  when he got into office was was reauthorized that that mean that day in
[24:16.360 --> 24:23.280]  2009 in January was it January 22nd or whatever he was sworn in boom boom first
[24:23.280 --> 24:26.800]  action next action make all of his records from college and everything
[24:26.800 --> 24:32.520]  else totally secret national security secrets and Congress isn't even allowed
[24:32.520 --> 24:36.800]  to see what's in that PDD effect I've had Congress people on on the National
[24:36.800 --> 24:40.960]  Security Committee over the years about that executive order under Bush and
[24:40.960 --> 24:45.120]  Obama saying they've asked to see it and been told you're not allowed to see it
[24:45.120 --> 24:49.680]  this is the legitimate government of the Congress as powerful or more on paper in
[24:49.680 --> 24:53.320]  the Constitution than the president the last hundred years they've taught
[24:53.320 --> 24:57.000]  co-equal before that it was Congress was the most powerful because it controls
[24:57.000 --> 25:02.840]  the power of the purse and it was the most diversified with its own
[25:02.840 --> 25:06.760]  separation of power so you don't get a dictator you have three branches of
[25:06.760 --> 25:10.920]  government then you have nine justices and you have 500 plus members of the
[25:10.920 --> 25:14.480]  Congress they're always adding more as population goes up the House and Senate
[25:14.480 --> 25:19.040]  hundred senators and a portion by population the House that's more
[25:19.040 --> 25:23.000]  division so that you can't get a centralized click that ends up becoming
[25:23.000 --> 25:29.360]  dictatorial but it can still happen and now Congress has basically seated all of
[25:29.360 --> 25:38.640]  this incredible power over to the presidency and then didn't do anything a
[25:38.640 --> 25:44.320]  few people criticized it Ron Paul criticized it a few other congressmen
[25:44.320 --> 25:49.360]  we had on criticized it at the time but that was it and then now you fast forward
[25:49.360 --> 25:53.400]  seven years does this happen a year before Obama the
[25:53.400 --> 25:57.600]  abomination got in and Obama conservatively according to most
[25:57.600 --> 26:01.280]  constitutional lawyers I talked to and I agree with their analysis is about ten
[26:01.280 --> 26:05.800]  times worse than Bush when it comes to power grabbing and Bush was the worst
[26:05.800 --> 26:11.000]  ever and they use 9-11 to do that and I was no fan of Bush as people know now
[26:11.000 --> 26:16.880]  it's it's light-eared ahead ten times worse conservatively and how does the
[26:16.880 --> 26:19.600]  Republican leadership respond this has been covered in the press finally
[26:19.600 --> 26:23.000]  Obama said last week I'll act on my own to make breakthroughs this year on
[26:23.000 --> 26:31.760]  energy on borders on illegals on guns on military operations on Obamacare on
[26:31.760 --> 26:37.000]  everything and Congress says oh yeah and by the way you just decided to do with
[26:37.000 --> 26:42.720]  the what you want with the NSA so Obama comes out with rhetoric and criticizes
[26:42.720 --> 26:48.240]  it but then meanwhile is massively increasing the funding and expanding all
[26:48.240 --> 26:53.080]  of it and they make it about well it's who has the data and we promise to
[26:53.080 --> 26:57.480]  reform it where we grab everything you do illegally and we lied to say we
[26:57.480 --> 27:00.800]  weren't doing that but now that we've been caught doing it we promise to be
[27:00.800 --> 27:06.160]  nice with it and then they play these lawyer games all day with it listen you
[27:06.160 --> 27:10.160]  talk about discrimination about religion or color or all these distractions they
[27:10.160 --> 27:13.800]  use and divide and conquer the real discrimination is special interest with
[27:13.800 --> 27:19.320]  access to this type of data the fortune 1000 folks on record are in all that data
[27:19.320 --> 27:25.520]  it's being bought it's being sold the big Microsoft's and Google's and Yahoo's
[27:25.520 --> 27:28.960]  and all of them act like they're not part of it they've all been caught at
[27:28.960 --> 27:33.520]  fundamental levels feeding and gathering the data back into the central hub and
[27:33.520 --> 27:38.800]  the NSA and cybersecurity is really a global not just national clearinghouse
[27:38.800 --> 27:46.080]  for all of this data that you don't get access to and then when you finally sell
[27:46.080 --> 27:51.280]  out to the system you're given access to all the marketing data all of it okay
[27:51.280 --> 27:55.240]  that's how this really works and I was told this before it all came out by very
[27:55.240 --> 28:00.440]  high-level people and you notice it's all come out now I don't know why so many
[28:00.440 --> 28:05.840]  high-level people in the 18 years I've been on air always give me the data we're
[28:05.840 --> 28:08.840]  going to break in a moment but I've got to start going to these clips let's take

[33:33.680 --> 33:38.800]  Obama tells Bloomberg that it's racial animus is the reason his approval
[33:38.800 --> 33:43.760]  ratings dropping it was white folks that put him in office hoping for racial
[33:43.760 --> 33:48.600]  reconciliation and of course Obama has used it for Balkanization and race
[33:48.600 --> 33:54.680]  baiting and race hustling like Al Sharpton instead and by the way I was
[33:54.680 --> 33:58.480]  correct it's PDD 51 that Bush signed and then an accompanying executive order
[33:58.480 --> 34:03.440]  that Obama signed when he got back into office and under PDD 51 you can read the
[34:03.440 --> 34:08.240]  Army Times itself or see congressional debates about it Congress is suspended
[34:08.240 --> 34:13.040]  but the classified version of it even Congress isn't allowed to see well I mean
[34:13.040 --> 34:16.240]  that's the president being a dictator right there Congress is co-equal to
[34:16.240 --> 34:22.240]  the president now Obama says though that Paul Revere spied on the British yes a
[34:22.240 --> 34:26.560]  foreign enemy invading who had been illegally spying on them that's why we
[34:26.560 --> 34:30.120]  have the fourth amendment Obama represents the globalists that are
[34:30.120 --> 34:34.560]  literally occupying this country in authoritarian takeover a corporate
[34:34.560 --> 34:39.280]  anti-free market Trony capitalist takeover using socialism to domesticate
[34:39.280 --> 34:44.880]  the public let's go to that clip from Friday of our republic a small secret
[34:44.880 --> 34:51.120]  surveillance committee born out of the sons of Liberty was established in
[34:51.120 --> 34:57.760]  Boston and the group's members included Paul Revere at night they would patrol
[34:57.760 --> 35:02.880]  the streets reporting back any signs that the British were preparing raids
[35:02.880 --> 35:07.040]  against America's early patriots look he has American flags behind him like he's
[35:07.040 --> 35:11.160]  a good guy out of American history intelligence has helped secure our
[35:11.160 --> 35:15.720]  country that's enough freedoms yeah intelligence against real enemies
[35:15.720 --> 35:21.920]  against foreign ships against people landing here's what senator Rand Paul had
[35:21.920 --> 35:26.640]  to say about it mentioned Paul Revere but Paul Revere was a warning us of the
[35:26.640 --> 35:30.560]  British coming he wasn't warning us that the Americans are coming you know the
[35:30.560 --> 35:33.720]  thing is is that the lesson from the American Revolution that the president
[35:33.720 --> 35:38.120]  I think misunderstands is that we were upset about British soldiers writing
[35:38.120 --> 35:42.200]  their own general warrants like national security letters they're like the dawn
[35:42.200 --> 35:46.680]  of our Republic all right ladies and gentlemen so there you go he says that
[35:46.680 --> 35:51.800]  the dawn of our Republic he was basically doing all of this keeping us
[35:51.800 --> 35:57.440]  safe and Rand Paul responded now shifting gears back into these articles
[35:57.440 --> 36:02.600]  here's our article from August of last year DOD training manual says
[36:02.600 --> 36:07.200]  extremist founding fathers quote would not be welcome in today's military and
[36:07.200 --> 36:12.960]  actually badmouths George Washington then Fox News pick this up CNN then
[36:12.960 --> 36:16.800]  picked it up the CNN was like maybe that's a good idea maybe the founders are
[36:16.800 --> 36:23.680]  bad up next are the founders bad so this Obama run military badmouths George
[36:23.680 --> 36:27.720]  Washington and gun ownership and they train to fight the Tea Party that best
[36:27.720 --> 36:32.520]  represents the founding ideas of this country the real Tea Party and the
[36:32.520 --> 36:36.320]  entire establishments against him and he has the nerve to say at the dawn of our
[36:36.320 --> 36:43.880]  Republic intelligence was used yes against open enemies landing not against
[36:43.880 --> 36:47.720]  what you're doing on Facebook or what you're talking to your mother about on
[36:47.720 --> 36:52.240]  the telephone we're gonna go out to break with part of my report that I filed
[36:52.240 --> 36:56.600]  Friday night on the fact that Obama's trying to mainline all this right now
[36:56.600 --> 37:00.440]  and make it look like it's mainstream because they've all committed billions
[37:00.440 --> 37:04.360]  of felonies every time they grab surveillance or grab your communicates
[37:04.360 --> 37:08.320]  without warrants it's a felony and now they're trying to hide this in plain
[37:08.320 --> 37:15.440]  view here's the report the reforms I'm proposing today should give the American
[37:15.440 --> 37:20.000]  people greater confidence that their rights are being protected even as our
[37:20.000 --> 37:23.800]  intelligence and law enforcement agencies maintain the tools they need to
[37:23.800 --> 37:28.040]  keep us safe the bottom line is that people around the world regardless of
[37:28.040 --> 37:32.560]  their nationality should know that the United States is not spying on ordinary
[37:32.560 --> 37:37.440]  people who don't threaten our national security president Obama came out today
[37:37.440 --> 37:45.600]  and said relax Paul Revere would love the NSA the NSA spying on you and your
[37:45.600 --> 37:51.040]  family or like your neighbors in your local community they want to help you
[37:51.040 --> 37:55.800]  ladies and gentlemen we knew 15 years ago exactly what the national security
[37:55.800 --> 38:02.320]  agency and 14 other illegal agencies were doing grabbing all the digital
[38:02.320 --> 38:07.840]  data and putting it through major hubs to sift through the information not to
[38:07.840 --> 38:12.840]  look for terrorists they keep saying oh we had the NSA in place 9-11 wouldn't
[38:12.840 --> 38:17.200]  have happened Sibel Edmonds has gone public and other whistleblowers who
[38:17.200 --> 38:22.360]  were there on the days before 9-11 tracking the CIA and others protecting
[38:22.360 --> 38:27.440]  al-Qaeda protecting the hijackers the FBI lived with some of them they were
[38:27.440 --> 38:33.000]  just patsy cutouts like Lee Harvey Oswald and Tim McVeigh but shifting out of
[38:33.000 --> 38:37.680]  that Obama saying we don't spy on citizens and we don't spy on foreign
[38:37.680 --> 38:41.960]  leaders it's on record they spy on Merkel the head of Germany and others
[38:41.960 --> 38:47.600]  it's on record that Congress is being spied on it's on record that hundreds of
[38:47.600 --> 38:52.560]  major corporations that are part of this are feeding their data from Microsoft to
[38:52.560 --> 39:01.280]  Google to Apple into the NSA grids under Obamacare your health care is filed
[39:01.280 --> 39:06.400]  through prism into the NSA so this is all in the fine print this is not a
[39:06.400 --> 39:10.520]  mystery but the general public who was told for decades the government's not
[39:10.520 --> 39:14.400]  watching you because it's illegal that's a conspiracy theory even as
[39:14.400 --> 39:18.920]  whistleblowers like Wayne Madsen from the NSA went public in the mid 90s they
[39:18.920 --> 39:23.360]  would deny that it was happening so the big revelation is that they lied to us
[39:23.360 --> 39:28.800]  they are surveilling us they're using it to target the press from AP to Fox News
[39:28.800 --> 39:33.160]  they're using it to spy on the troops members of the NSA are using it on
[39:33.160 --> 39:37.240]  record to spy on their wives and girlfriends and husbands this is
[39:37.240 --> 39:42.240]  insane of course this unconstitutional power is being abused that's why it's
[39:42.240 --> 39:47.880]  always been illegal in any free society and so why did Obama get up there and
[39:47.880 --> 39:52.200]  give this hour-long speech today because he's desperate he doesn't want to go to
[39:52.200 --> 39:59.160]  jail he's been part of expanding illegal NSA wiretapping and mass searches of
[39:59.160 --> 40:03.960]  internet data private data they've been part of the Homeland Security rollout
[40:03.960 --> 40:08.840]  putting up these police polls that have wireless hubs that grab all of your
[40:08.840 --> 40:13.720]  cell phone info illegally they have been part of this takeover along with the
[40:13.720 --> 40:17.440]  Republican leadership and the Democratic leadership in the Congress the
[40:17.440 --> 40:22.080]  courts have been complicit to a great extent and so now they need to mainline
[40:22.080 --> 40:26.680]  it and say okay we're spying on you but I'm gonna clean it up I'm gonna fix it
[40:26.680 --> 40:31.120]  I'm going to make sure that it's done properly this is the guy that betrayed us
[40:31.120 --> 40:35.080]  on Obamacare this is the guy caught line more than any other president before
[40:35.080 --> 40:39.640]  you like your doctor you like your plan you can keep your doctor you can keep
[40:39.640 --> 40:44.360]  your plan you like your current insurance you keep that insurance period
[40:44.360 --> 40:52.560]  they're just conditioning us in a process to accept total surveillance and
[40:52.560 --> 40:58.080]  they're telling us that total surveillance beyond 1984 is as American as
[40:58.080 --> 41:05.000]  apple pie just a year ago clapper does the NSA collect any type of data at all
[41:05.000 --> 41:12.800]  on millions or hundreds of millions of Americans no sir the NSA specifically
[41:12.800 --> 41:18.240]  targets the communications of everyone it ingests them by default they are
[41:18.240 --> 41:23.440]  liars they are lying to you like you're a foreign military enemy because America
[41:23.440 --> 41:29.040]  has been hijacked by a corporate offshore takeover that is putting spy
[41:29.040 --> 41:34.040]  hubs into everything from your refrigerator to your computer to your so
[41:34.040 --> 41:39.160]  called smartphone this is the nature of the new web that's being built it's
[41:39.160 --> 41:43.960]  based on you being surveilled it's based on you having no privacy and they
[41:43.960 --> 41:48.440]  think you're stupid and they're they're telling you we don't spy on you without
[41:48.440 --> 41:52.760]  warrants oh we got caught well we don't drag net all the info oh we got caught
[41:52.760 --> 41:56.880]  we don't use it politically oh we got caught we don't use it to persecute

[42:12.880 --> 42:16.200]  allow terrorists to attack us the same ones they're funding in Syria and say
[42:16.200 --> 42:23.080]  see we told you so you rained in the NSA and this happened when they'll never
[42:23.080 --> 42:28.040]  even ran it in to begin with its main mission is getting key data to be able
[42:28.040 --> 42:32.880]  to leverage out their competition in the marketplace it's so insiders can game

[47:39.440 --> 47:45.760]  worldwide reaching tens of millions every week and growing exponentially we
[47:45.760 --> 47:50.920]  sent jacari Jackson and other reporters Don Salazar and crew to the west coast
[47:50.920 --> 47:55.480]  to check on Fukushima radiation down the west coast was at least three times
[47:55.480 --> 48:00.760]  normal background levels with our gager counters and field meters something
[48:00.760 --> 48:05.320]  confirmed by health departments up and down the coast but it was almost a
[48:05.320 --> 48:10.440]  non-issue for the media that made fun of us for even caring in major west coast
[48:10.440 --> 48:18.280]  newspapers but the good news is everywhere we set up even on rural coastlines
[48:18.280 --> 48:24.400]  with 10 people walking by in an hour they would have listeners everywhere walk
[48:24.400 --> 48:28.080]  up and say jacari Jackson it looks jacari's been here a little over a year
[48:28.080 --> 48:33.720]  he does the nightly news and people already all over the country every time
[48:33.720 --> 48:38.720]  they stopped at every restaurant every hotel every beach our listeners were
[48:38.720 --> 48:46.480]  everywhere well I want to hear from our listeners out there specifically today
[48:46.480 --> 48:51.280]  on the NSA what do you think of Obama speech I mean that's a big deal to have
[48:51.280 --> 48:55.560]  an American president come out there and tell more lies and say we don't
[48:55.560 --> 48:59.000]  spy on the average person don't wear we're keeping it in a safe place good
[48:59.000 --> 49:01.960]  people look at it it's not about who's looking at it you saying they're good
[49:01.960 --> 49:05.920]  neighbors like senator Paul said it's about that it's illegal you're doing
[49:05.920 --> 49:09.280]  it and you lied about it I remember Bush like eight years ago I played the
[49:09.280 --> 49:12.720]  clips many times saying we don't listen to anybody domestically without a warrant
[49:12.720 --> 49:17.440]  only overseas we all knew that was bull there was NSA whistleblowers in the
[49:17.440 --> 49:20.720]  mid 90s and there was whistleblowers in 2000 there was whistleblowers I
[49:20.720 --> 49:27.320]  interviewed them Wayne Madsen and so many others we've interviewed a few
[49:27.320 --> 49:30.920]  weeks ago the top NSA whistleblower who was the equivalent of a general at the
[49:30.920 --> 49:37.800]  NSA and he just said it's all complete lies but it's admitted lies I mean they
[49:37.800 --> 49:41.040]  said they weren't doing it now they say oh it's for your own good more lies
[49:41.040 --> 49:46.080]  ladies and gentlemen they've been caught using it against Fox News they've been
[49:46.080 --> 49:49.680]  caught using it against the Associated Press they've been caught using it against
[49:49.680 --> 49:57.160]  the Drudge Report there was a lawsuit by former congressman what two years ago the
[49:57.160 --> 50:02.200]  former congressman for all is it Georgia Bob Barr was it Virginia I can't
[50:02.200 --> 50:05.560]  remember it's been on the show but when I get Bob Barr back on about that they're
[50:05.560 --> 50:11.280]  two years yes Virginia they're two years I can't believe my memory now see where
[50:11.280 --> 50:14.640]  Bob Barr was a congressman from about to get really angry and myself for not
[50:14.640 --> 50:19.440]  don't remember that the point is is we had Bob Barr on with Liberty Guard suing
[50:19.440 --> 50:23.560]  the TSA because they got documents that they were getting fed data on drudge
[50:23.560 --> 50:28.320]  Matt drudge Alex Jones because we were the ones driving the whole awakening to
[50:28.320 --> 50:32.680]  the TSA that's a big deal that's costing the country 40 to 60 billion dollars a
[50:32.680 --> 50:38.080]  year in lost revenue lost tourism that's USA Today's own numbers from the
[50:38.080 --> 50:41.560]  federal government and from the trade commissions from the Association of
[50:41.560 --> 50:46.400]  Hotels and others 40 plus billion dollars a year we're fighting it they admit
[50:46.400 --> 50:49.880]  they've never caught one terrorist with it it's pure theater it's training
[50:49.880 --> 50:54.080]  everybody how to be slaves and info wars calm led the fight against that I'm
[50:54.080 --> 50:58.840]  not bragging I'm showing how weak the establishment is that info wars calm
[50:58.840 --> 51:02.600]  put out the reports the videos of them groping people's genitals and then the
[51:02.600 --> 51:06.880]  TSA saying we don't do that and then drudge took our articles posted it got
[51:06.880 --> 51:10.720]  attacked for posting it and then they had to admit it was all true there it is
[51:10.720 --> 51:18.520]  Bob Barr falls lawsuit against TSA over drudge controversy that was back in 2012
[51:18.520 --> 51:23.280]  former congressman Bob Barr's Liberty Guard organization and they declared
[51:23.280 --> 51:29.240]  national security a year later and would not release the rest of the leaked
[51:29.240 --> 51:34.320]  info on us that's who the NSA is watching they're watching Fox News and I'm
[51:34.320 --> 51:37.320]  not saying Fox is perfect but that ought to tell you something they're watching
[51:37.320 --> 51:40.520]  the associated press which isn't perfect that I'll tell you something they're
[51:40.520 --> 51:44.800]  watching all the major media ladies and gentlemen the Pentagon admits that the
[51:44.800 --> 51:48.840]  Pentagon said four months ago they're gonna go out and engage the media the
[51:48.840 --> 51:53.960]  new media any independent media yeah he was from Georgia I was right the first
[51:53.960 --> 51:58.440]  time but see I question my memory it's just not photographic anymore it's like
[51:58.440 --> 52:02.800]  losing a family member that my brain used to be photographic after seeing
[52:02.800 --> 52:07.200]  something one time unless it was mathematical I'm not good at math but it
[52:07.200 --> 52:13.400]  was word or visual 100% recall now it's like 95% I'm just I'm just it's kind of
[52:13.400 --> 52:16.280]  ruining the show isn't it that I'm just not confident like I used to be but I
[52:16.280 --> 52:21.000]  just need to check every bit of that information the point is is that it's
[52:21.000 --> 52:24.880]  so frustrating to know what they're doing preparing the military for war with
[52:24.880 --> 52:29.240]  a tea party preparing for national gun confiscation in the Army manuals saying
[52:29.240 --> 52:32.960]  they're gonna put us in re-education camps and using the term re-education
[52:32.960 --> 52:38.120]  camp type into a search engine Army manual re-education camp you'll get
[52:38.120 --> 52:43.920]  army.mil the Army's response two years ago when we got that document sent to us
[52:43.920 --> 52:47.360]  by someone in the federal government I'll leave it that was to put it on their
[52:47.360 --> 52:51.840]  website a month later on army.mil like okay big deal we declassified it by
[52:51.840 --> 52:58.640]  fiat what is in the news today and associated press the NSA is
[52:58.640 --> 53:04.400]  declassifying millions of pages of data ahead of Obama declassifying it to
[53:04.400 --> 53:08.560]  make him look like a reformer they want to look like oh we have nothing to hide
[53:08.560 --> 53:12.760]  here here's the civilian inmate labor camp program sure we're getting ready to
[53:12.760 --> 53:19.080]  put gun owners in camps big deal sure at military bases we say any evangelical
[53:19.080 --> 53:22.880]  Christian or gun owners a terrorist and the founding fathers are bad I mean look
[53:22.880 --> 53:27.200]  we get the document a week later it's forced out in the news first they say oh

[56:29.840 --> 56:34.440]  raw story which is a democratic front group on record I'm in a front rip they
[56:34.440 --> 56:37.480]  admit it and he's very proud of this they they're very proud of this type of
[56:37.480 --> 56:42.640]  authoritarian talk governor Andrew Cuomo says gun-loving pro-lifers not welcome
[56:42.640 --> 56:48.000]  in New York right explodes he was in the Albany Times Union they quoted him the
[56:48.000 --> 56:52.080]  reporter they're gonna post a recording of it and he says they have no place in
[56:52.080 --> 56:56.240]  New York State they have no place to stay in New York because that's not what
[56:56.240 --> 57:01.400]  New Yorkers are so see he'll decide even if you disagree with pro-lifers and you
[57:01.400 --> 57:07.400]  disagree with gun owners they're open and liberal so they don't agree with you
[57:07.400 --> 57:11.080]  because that's not who new New Yorkers are he will dictate and say you're not
[57:11.080 --> 57:16.640]  welcome here I mean this guy literally ought to move to North Korea Kim Jong

[01:00:25.280 --> 01:00:29.960]  NSA and proven that they're surveilling him and harassing him who's been
[01:00:29.960 --> 01:00:33.840]  demonized by the progressive cancer press the so-called liberals that are

[01:00:44.920 --> 01:00:48.040]  have been plugging that he was coming up but it's good to continue the whole
[01:00:48.040 --> 01:00:54.000]  NSA discussion but also go over some articles with him as well just amazing
[01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:57.560]  work he's done a judicial watch over the years and now heading up his own
[01:00:57.560 --> 01:01:02.560]  organization right now let's go to Terry in Washington Terry you're on the year
[01:01:02.560 --> 01:01:07.400]  well thanks for calling in on this Sunday Alex did talk to me hey did you
[01:01:07.400 --> 01:01:12.400]  watch the Jay Leno show last week when Mark Cuban was on there no I didn't watch
[01:01:12.400 --> 01:01:17.400]  the owner of the Dallas Mavericks on Jay Leno but I know I've talked to him
[01:01:17.400 --> 01:01:24.600]  behind the scenes a few times and I know that he's about cyber dust I don't know
[01:01:24.600 --> 01:01:28.520]  about cyber does I'm just saying I know Mark Cuban behind the scenes is an
[01:01:28.520 --> 01:01:32.720]  anti-neural order Patriot and I know the government came after him for it he put
[01:01:32.720 --> 01:01:43.200]  out an app called cyber dust and you can get it from online and what it does you
[01:01:43.200 --> 01:01:49.000]  can send a text and second step do you send it it's gone and if they cannot
[01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:53.920]  track it it's called cyber dust well I know they've got a lot of that type
[01:01:53.920 --> 01:01:59.320]  technology that only exists once but I'm telling you they're going after the
[01:01:59.320 --> 01:02:03.160]  stuff that you try to hide the answer is just realize any digital
[01:02:03.160 --> 01:02:06.920]  communications you shouldn't communicate on if it's important information not
[01:02:06.920 --> 01:02:13.000]  hidden information but important company info my dad got a tour of all things
[01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:17.080]  the sewer system in Paris one time because believe it or not it's one of
[01:02:17.080 --> 01:02:21.160]  the most important ones in the world and most complex and they they communicate
[01:02:21.160 --> 01:02:25.000]  with a pneumatic tube like at the bank when the message comes to you that way
[01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:28.960]  because they know all digital communications are captured and they've
[01:02:28.960 --> 01:02:32.880]  been trying to roll it out like oh yeah look for pressure cookers in Florida so
[01:02:32.880 --> 01:02:36.680]  we swat team them they're trying to make it sound like it's for terrorism but I
[01:02:36.680 --> 01:02:42.640]  wouldn't be surprised that Mark Cuban is you know trying to fight the NSA
[01:02:42.640 --> 01:02:46.120]  he was going to put out a 9-11 film I was making this came out later in the
[01:02:46.120 --> 01:02:49.000]  New York Times and the government actually called him up and said we're
[01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:53.600]  going to put you in prison and set you up for made-up stock fraud charges like
[01:02:53.600 --> 01:02:58.160]  Martha Stewart if you don't back off and he said to myself and Charlie Sheen
[01:02:58.160 --> 01:03:01.720]  of all people and you look this up folks is in the news because it came out years
[01:03:01.720 --> 01:03:05.800]  after I wasn't allowed to talk about it but I can now even when he said I look
[01:03:05.800 --> 01:03:09.360]  I just can't do this they threatened me they're gonna set me up they still tried
[01:03:09.360 --> 01:03:13.360]  to put him in jail even after he backed off does that give you an idea of how
[01:03:13.360 --> 01:03:20.680]  evil this government is my god well well tell me about this the cyber dust it
[01:03:20.680 --> 01:03:26.240]  sounds interesting it's just a map you can get there you can you know just go
[01:03:26.240 --> 01:03:30.280]  to your app thing on your on your iPhone or whatever you got and just look up
[01:03:30.280 --> 01:03:35.400]  cyber dust well you know a lot of people say why should I hide what I do

[01:04:24.600 --> 01:04:28.720]  because he was he was he was on the hour given the speech before I went live
[01:04:28.720 --> 01:04:35.280]  Friday you know 11 a.m. and or 12 noon Eastern and I couldn't watch it while I
[01:04:35.280 --> 01:04:38.120]  was in my office getting ready and then I tried to watch it Friday night to get
[01:04:38.120 --> 01:04:42.360]  clips out of it and it's just the whole things a giant fraud lie and we're

[01:07:26.120 --> 01:07:31.240]  Asia slash North America deal industry powers with access to TPP plans
[01:07:31.240 --> 01:07:36.320]  lavish money on Congress secretly lobbying when the actual treaty is
[01:07:36.320 --> 01:07:40.840]  still secret though part of it released by WikiLeaks Larry claiming is the
[01:07:40.840 --> 01:07:46.200]  only person in the last year who has successfully gotten a federal judge to
[01:07:46.200 --> 01:07:50.440]  agree to hear their case saying undoubtedly illegal fourth amendment
[01:07:50.440 --> 01:07:55.080]  violations are going on with the national security agency and confirming
[01:07:55.080 --> 01:07:59.760]  that Larry claiming and others have been harassed at his law firm and again it
[01:07:59.760 --> 01:08:04.480]  is alternative media which is the real media it is the associated press Fox
[01:08:04.480 --> 01:08:10.240]  News drudge report comm info wars comm have all been targeted by the NSA my
[01:08:10.240 --> 01:08:15.360]  shelf and drudge via the TSA with access to the federal data and they give
[01:08:15.360 --> 01:08:20.720]  security briefings on us they demonize us all because we criticize them sticking
[01:08:20.720 --> 01:08:26.120]  their hands down people's pants as Bob Bar's lawsuit showed against the TSA and
[01:08:26.120 --> 01:08:30.520]  then they said oh we don't do that and we show them lying and so they then open
[01:08:30.520 --> 01:08:35.000]  national security investigations on us this is the type of stuff that's going
[01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:39.560]  on and Larry claiming I mean I cannot tell you folks and I don't usually kiss
[01:08:39.560 --> 01:08:43.600]  up to a lot of our guests but when they deserve it I try to let you know who
[01:08:43.600 --> 01:08:47.920]  you're listening to he found a judicial watch then moved on to open up even more
[01:08:47.920 --> 01:08:51.840]  powerful organizations he's a frequent contributor and advisor to world net
[01:08:51.840 --> 01:08:55.920]  daily television and radio and a weekly columnist and Larry claiming is
[01:08:55.920 --> 01:08:59.320]  demonized and attacked everywhere because he's so effective and such a
[01:08:59.320 --> 01:09:04.320]  patriot and he just continues to you know he's the guy that helped expose
[01:09:04.320 --> 01:09:08.160]  Bill Clinton he's an almost brought him down he's the guy that exposed Bush on
[01:09:08.160 --> 01:09:14.160]  all the constitutions destroying stuff and now he's been savaging Obama and
[01:09:14.160 --> 01:09:19.480]  winning in court when no one else is against the NSA and I wanted to get
[01:09:19.480 --> 01:09:25.280]  updates from him about the case about Obama's speech Friday I mean incredible
[01:09:25.280 --> 01:09:29.240]  lies everything Obama said is a lie on record they're counting on the public
[01:09:29.240 --> 01:09:34.000]  not researching what the NSA is really up to targeting the press targeting the
[01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:38.400]  Tea Party targeting pro-life grips target targeting law firms like Larry
[01:09:38.400 --> 01:09:43.960]  claimants that tirelessly call for him just to resign forget Congress and
[01:09:43.960 --> 01:09:47.920]  teaching him but I wanted to get Larry number one on before we get into his
[01:09:47.920 --> 01:09:51.880]  speech and what Obama is doing and the latest on his case I wanted to get Larry
[01:09:51.880 --> 01:09:57.040]  claiming on because what is it like for him who I know has the same burning in
[01:09:57.040 --> 01:10:01.000]  his heart to hate tyranny and tyrants and frauds and knows we're going into a
[01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:05.880]  total authoritarian system knows we're gonna have to leave the country if we
[01:10:05.880 --> 01:10:09.600]  don't turn this around soon and and I know Larry he's not gonna leave you're
[01:10:09.600 --> 01:10:14.000]  not gonna leave a fight so this is life and death folks as Joseph Farrell of
[01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:17.520]  world that daily said last year on my show he said look I'm not a big fan of
[01:10:17.520 --> 01:10:22.080]  Mitt Romney but he goes if Obama wins he's gonna come after us and then he
[01:10:22.080 --> 01:10:24.960]  told me on fair you know the harassment Alex you know the harassment I get you
[01:10:24.960 --> 01:10:28.760]  get well the word is from because they're in Virginia is they're gonna come
[01:10:28.760 --> 01:10:32.800]  after us and now you see it was already going on so what does he think of
[01:10:32.800 --> 01:10:36.160]  Congress last week the Republican leadership in the house with the
[01:10:36.160 --> 01:10:39.920]  Democrats on the Senate saying you know what we're gonna let Obama decide what
[01:10:39.920 --> 01:10:47.800]  to do with the NSA crimes and Obama saying quote I'll act on my own to have
[01:10:47.800 --> 01:10:52.920]  a breakthrough year I mean this is maker to break it 2014 the people don't
[01:10:52.920 --> 01:10:58.000]  like Obama so he's in Bloomberg saying it's racial animus is a quote Bloomberg
[01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:03.960]  January 19th that's today Sunday Bloomberg Obama says racial animus
[01:11:03.960 --> 01:11:09.040]  blunts approval New Yorker reports and we're gonna give you not just with the
[01:11:09.040 --> 01:11:13.120]  worldnet daily.com website but also we'll put Larry Larry claiming site up on
[01:11:13.120 --> 01:11:18.080]  screen for TV viewers as well Larry thank you so much for coming on with us
[01:11:18.080 --> 01:11:21.440]  we're going to break here in about four or five minutes but I want to give you
[01:11:21.440 --> 01:11:25.160]  the floor in the next segment but you heard that cornucopia that constellation
[01:11:25.160 --> 01:11:29.000]  of items I threw out which one you want to tackle first well let's talk about
[01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:33.200]  the NSA thank you Alex for this very nice introduction it's mutual thank you
[01:11:33.200 --> 01:11:35.560]  we need people in this country to stand up to these
[01:11:35.560 --> 01:11:40.880]  tolerance and that's what they are what we heard about the NSA after we got an
[01:11:40.880 --> 01:11:45.680]  injunction on December 16th of last year was that Obama was gonna make
[01:11:45.680 --> 01:11:50.320]  recommendation it's kind of like O.J. Simpson being told don't kill again
[01:11:50.320 --> 01:11:55.160]  we'll pass a new law to prevent that ridiculous we have current laws the
[01:11:55.160 --> 01:11:58.640]  laws if they had been properly enforced however bad they are would not have
[01:11:58.640 --> 01:12:04.240]  resulted in spying on over 300 American citizens it's like hiring Genghis Khan
[01:12:04.240 --> 01:12:09.760]  to write a law to stop pillaging right it's just an excuse and the same thing
[01:12:09.760 --> 01:12:13.720]  was done back in the late 1990s when we uncovered the China Gates scandal
[01:12:13.720 --> 01:12:16.960]  when Clinton was taking all that money from the Chinese that's right you did
[01:12:16.960 --> 01:12:21.920]  that you did that yeah and you know so what we need campaign finance reform
[01:12:21.920 --> 01:12:26.600]  office before we kill again and of course money flowed into the coffers of
[01:12:26.600 --> 01:12:30.280]  both political parties and most particularly Obama you know a lot of
[01:12:30.280 --> 01:12:35.120]  muscle money in both elections that's never been raised and the bottom line
[01:12:35.120 --> 01:12:40.000]  is that his recommendations mean nothing he can't change the law anyway
[01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:45.160]  in the last time as it is if it had been enforced and we need this court that we
[01:12:45.160 --> 01:12:49.120]  have this case in front of to really take hold and it to monitor and to allow
[01:12:49.120 --> 01:12:53.800]  us to take discovery and to do all these things to do the best we can to try to
[01:12:53.800 --> 01:12:58.440]  ensure that the constitutional abuses are kept to a minimum but it doesn't
[01:12:58.440 --> 01:13:03.360]  really matter in a way Alex we are in a revolution we are in a war and we're
[01:13:03.360 --> 01:13:07.440]  gonna have to be vigilant the court case is one aspect of it but we're gonna have
[01:13:07.440 --> 01:13:11.640]  to resort to non-violent peaceful civil disobedience at the next step we're
[01:13:11.640 --> 01:13:16.000]  headed into a revolution otherwise I'd like to try to avoid that freedom watch
[01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:23.120]  USA dot org I mean again Larry claiming who did expose Laurel and Hughes and the
[01:13:23.120 --> 01:13:26.640]  manipulation of the special prosecutor and all the rest of it under Clinton so
[01:13:26.640 --> 01:13:31.480]  many other issues and only raises pedigree to show this guy's always at the
[01:13:31.480 --> 01:13:36.360]  heart of almost bringing down the tyranny and in fact you've backed them
[01:13:36.360 --> 01:13:41.620]  off many times what do we do to back off the NSA to back off the Democratic
[01:13:41.620 --> 01:13:45.800]  Party with full access to all of it to persecute their enemies for me that's
[01:13:45.800 --> 01:13:49.480]  the Achilles heel that they've been caught using this to go after real
[01:13:49.480 --> 01:13:53.760]  Republicans real libertarians I mean that's like Hitler literally in his
[01:13:53.760 --> 01:13:58.040]  first six seven years persecuting Jews politically before he started arresting
[01:13:58.040 --> 01:14:03.640]  him it's a police state there's no question about it and even if it was the
[01:14:03.640 --> 01:14:07.920]  very fact that we know every time we pick up the phone Alex that we are being
[01:14:07.920 --> 01:14:12.640]  monitored every time we send an email every time we go to Facebook or social
[01:14:12.640 --> 01:14:16.760]  media the chilling effect watched killing effect and it's a warning if you
[01:14:16.760 --> 01:14:23.240]  stick your neck out we the government run by King Barakusen Obama will chop it
[01:14:23.240 --> 01:14:27.160]  off and then you've got you know these Republicans on the other side of the
[01:14:27.160 --> 01:14:33.760]  aisle like Boehner speaker of the house Mitch McConnell McCain and the McCain
[01:14:33.760 --> 01:14:39.160]  others and Peter King God forbid I mean he's really made a fool of himself in
[01:14:39.160 --> 01:14:43.000]  the last several months and these people run interference for Obama because
[01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:46.680]  they're part of the establishment and they're you know they're jangling the
[01:14:46.680 --> 01:14:50.320]  change in Washington the lack of the way it is because they're making millions so
[01:14:50.320 --> 01:14:54.400]  you know in either terms of campaign contributions and sometimes even personally
[01:14:54.400 --> 01:14:59.600]  so it's a huge corrupt cabal and we the American people we need to all we can in
[01:14:59.600 --> 01:15:04.800]  court we have a great judge this judge Leon is stuck his neck out one of a
[01:15:04.800 --> 01:15:09.840]  handful I've met in my entire 37 year career but he's a hero but we the
[01:15:09.840 --> 01:15:13.720]  American people can't stop with that we need to peacefully go into the streets
[01:15:13.720 --> 01:15:19.520]  like Mahatma Gandhi did in South Africa and India like even Martin Luther King
[01:15:19.520 --> 01:15:23.000]  ironically the president like to talk about all the time we need to use those
[01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:27.200]  kinds of tactics you know that's incredible I was reading Martin Luther
[01:15:27.200 --> 01:15:32.400]  King's speech this morning my dad sent to me talking about if you won't stand up
[01:15:32.400 --> 01:15:37.000]  for liberty you're not even alive this morning and you look at Obama who is the
[01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:40.360]  complete opposite of total tyrant using the name of Martin Luther King I want to
[01:15:40.360 --> 01:15:43.760]  come back Larry claiming and talk to you about Congress giving him the
[01:15:43.760 --> 01:15:48.020]  dictatorial power to judge what the NSA does and doesn't do and to be the quote
[01:15:48.020 --> 01:15:54.480]  reformer I want to ask you about other issues Mario Cuomo governor Cuomo you
[01:15:54.480 --> 01:15:58.240]  will the son of Mario Cuomo Andrew Cuomo saying if you're pro-life or pro-gun
[01:15:58.240 --> 01:16:03.840]  get out of New York State in the last 50 years iodine has been phased out of our
[01:16:03.840 --> 01:16:08.880]  staple foods and replaced with the halogen bromine a practice now banned

[01:16:13.680 --> 01:16:18.360]  ladies and gentlemen Alex Jones here in 1924 the federal government did the
[01:16:18.360 --> 01:16:23.160]  right thing and encouraged salt producers to add iodine it's the good
[01:16:23.160 --> 01:16:28.440]  halogen on the periodic table and the results are on record reports documented
[01:16:28.440 --> 01:16:33.480]  a 15-point IQ increase in areas that had previously been deficient in iodine
[01:16:33.480 --> 01:16:39.560]  bottom line iodine is important unbound clean in a glycerin base nascent

[01:20:19.880 --> 01:20:26.040]  crashing through the lies and disinformation it's Alex Jones on the
[01:20:26.040 --> 01:20:29.880]  GCN radio network
[01:20:29.880 --> 01:20:34.280]  radio radio radio radio
[01:20:34.280 --> 01:20:39.120]  folks your phone calls for Larry Klayman coming up in the next segment
[01:20:39.120 --> 01:20:43.840]  crusading lawyer with more notches under his belt bringing down tyrants and
[01:20:43.840 --> 01:20:48.160]  damaging them and backing them off than probably any other individual lawyer or
[01:20:48.160 --> 01:20:53.440]  crusader I know a real crusader here and they demonizing because he tells it
[01:20:53.440 --> 01:20:59.280]  like it is they're scared of empowered individuals as Obama's top adviser said
[01:20:59.280 --> 01:21:03.400]  in an article to the Atlantic Council they're scared of activists they're
[01:21:03.400 --> 01:21:08.360]  scared of Snowden they're scared of people that care about morals and doing
[01:21:08.360 --> 01:21:13.560]  the right thing more than being camp followers and I was just thinking during
[01:21:13.560 --> 01:21:21.240]  the break about where we are historically the crossroads that we're at
[01:21:21.240 --> 01:21:26.480]  where the president now openly acts as a dictator doesn't mean he'll stay in
[01:21:26.480 --> 01:21:31.720]  office he might try but is acting as a dictator on almost every front and
[01:21:31.720 --> 01:21:36.360]  Congress is too unorganized or too intimidated to not do anything
[01:21:36.360 --> 01:21:40.920]  governments gearing up to go after real Americans Tea Party libertarians
[01:21:40.920 --> 01:21:46.240]  constitutionalist it's a twilight zone episode and and Larry claiming before we
[01:21:46.240 --> 01:21:50.400]  get more into in your moves to get Obama to resign what's happening with your
[01:21:50.400 --> 01:21:55.200]  case and the NSA that you've already won the first level of again just winning
[01:21:55.200 --> 01:21:58.920]  again trailblazing again all the North American Union documents you've gotten
[01:21:58.920 --> 01:22:03.720]  over the years you have a lot of high-level contacts what are they saying
[01:22:03.720 --> 01:22:08.720]  about this open militarization of police this open move towards martial law
[01:22:08.720 --> 01:22:15.200]  what's the word what's gonna happen if we don't stop Obama and his controllers
[01:22:15.200 --> 01:22:20.560]  because clearly they're going for broke right now clearly everybody picks up
[01:22:20.560 --> 01:22:24.440]  not just intellectually but in their gut things are very very serious what is
[01:22:24.440 --> 01:22:28.920]  the state of the world right now what are they planning well you're absolutely
[01:22:28.920 --> 01:22:33.080]  right Alex they are planning they're going for broke I don't think that the
[01:22:33.080 --> 01:22:38.880]  cards or the stars will line up to the ultra-left like they are today any other
[01:22:38.880 --> 01:22:42.040]  time in American history even with the changing demographics in the country
[01:22:42.040 --> 01:22:47.960]  because the Republicans are totally on the run they don't stand up for anything
[01:22:47.960 --> 01:22:53.240]  and they're able to roll them over we don't have a representative form of
[01:22:53.240 --> 01:22:57.840]  government anymore it's worse than it was with 1776 when we were wealthy we're
[01:22:57.840 --> 01:23:01.520]  not wealthy anymore so people that I know they answer your question are
[01:23:01.520 --> 01:23:06.020]  frightened people in the streets unfortunately most of them don't know
[01:23:06.020 --> 01:23:10.040]  what's going on and we need to educate them that's why what you do is so
[01:23:10.040 --> 01:23:14.720]  important what I'm doing is important and others drugs others we need to reach
[01:23:14.720 --> 01:23:18.600]  them because it's like we're sitting on the deck of the Titanic listening to
[01:23:18.600 --> 01:23:23.800]  chamber music is the ship of state is sinking and it's sinking really fast and
[01:23:23.800 --> 01:23:28.560]  when I go to Washington and I go there frequently and I look around and I look
[01:23:28.560 --> 01:23:32.640]  at these buildings that reminds me of looking at ancient Rome the buildings
[01:23:32.640 --> 01:23:37.880]  you know how it fell how powerful it was before it fell before it totally
[01:23:37.880 --> 01:23:41.800]  disrupted from within and that's what's happening to us now the people need to
[01:23:41.800 --> 01:23:48.000]  rise up you and I aren't leaving Dodge we're here till the very end and we'll
[01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:52.120]  deal our lives if we have to and and Americans need to realize that they're
[01:23:52.120 --> 01:23:56.320]  gonna have to take some risks that it's all gonna be going very shortly exactly
[01:23:56.320 --> 01:24:02.600]  not taking rid of this time not not taking risks now is the greatest risk
[01:24:02.600 --> 01:24:06.960]  people need to get that so what should they do Larry claiming well we're
[01:24:06.960 --> 01:24:09.960]  organizing that we of course have this court case and we're hopeful with this
[01:24:09.960 --> 01:24:13.840]  judge we'll be going to trial but that's just one part of it and we have other
[01:24:13.840 --> 01:24:18.760]  cases on the horizon as well but but we need and we'll be organizing this we did
[01:24:18.760 --> 01:24:24.480]  it last November we had a thing in Washington DC that was the first round
[01:24:24.480 --> 01:24:31.120]  of the second American Revolution so to reclaim America now that we are going
[01:24:31.120 --> 01:24:35.480]  to be going into the streets peacefully and we're going to be making our voices
[01:24:35.480 --> 01:24:38.880]  heard we're going to show them as Jefferson said at the height of the
[01:24:38.880 --> 01:24:42.400]  French Revolution he was quoted when the people fear the government this
[01:24:42.400 --> 01:24:46.040]  tyranny when the government fears the people is liberty they need to fear us
[01:24:46.040 --> 01:24:52.640]  because if indeed things don't change there will be a violent revolution and
[01:24:52.640 --> 01:24:56.440]  we don't want to see that you don't want to destroy the country but we really
[01:24:56.440 --> 01:25:01.040]  need to let them know that their time is up well I was about to say Larry
[01:25:01.040 --> 01:25:05.560]  ship out absolutely I was about to say it'd be bad enough if they were
[01:25:05.560 --> 01:25:10.600]  surveilling us illegally and doing some bad stuff I'd try to reform it I thought
[01:25:10.600 --> 01:25:14.200]  Clinton was bad I thought Bush was bad but I mean now under Obama the bottom is
[01:25:14.200 --> 01:25:17.920]  falling out but they're trying to shut down our power plants our businesses
[01:25:17.920 --> 01:25:23.200]  they're saying our kids don't belong to us on the news they're saying that they're
[01:25:23.200 --> 01:25:29.040]  gonna take our guns by executive order the governor of New York is quoted as
[01:25:29.040 --> 01:25:33.560]  saying pro livers and gun owners are not welcome that's a quote I mean these
[01:25:33.560 --> 01:25:39.240]  people are flaming authoritarians by every benchmark why are they so arrogant
[01:25:39.240 --> 01:25:43.080]  why are they so confident Larry claiming because they don't have an
[01:25:43.080 --> 01:25:47.000]  opposition in Congress forget about Congress doesn't exist as far as I'm
[01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:51.480]  concerned the executives this is being ruled by an evil tyrant who wants to
[01:25:51.480 --> 01:25:56.040]  socialize and Muslim life this country let's be blunt about it too Alex you
[01:25:56.040 --> 01:26:01.400]  know I just I represented the African-American workers at the post
[01:26:01.400 --> 01:26:05.680]  office when they were anthraxed after 9-11 I'm in effect a civil rights lawyer
[01:26:05.680 --> 01:26:09.200]  so I hope people take this right but you know what we need to start talking
[01:26:09.200 --> 01:26:14.120]  out this guy is a racist this president and if you look at his policy their
[01:26:14.120 --> 01:26:19.960]  design for us to pay reparations he wants to dismantle this country and stuff
[01:26:19.960 --> 01:26:25.320]  the pocket because his followers well sure he uses racist stuff to divide and
[01:26:25.320 --> 01:26:29.080]  conquer and make money off of it that's right and you know we wanted to be the
[01:26:29.080 --> 01:26:32.880]  president of everybody we want him to unite everybody black white red green
[01:26:32.880 --> 01:26:37.520]  whoever but he's in it for only his people and I know that that sounds
[01:26:37.520 --> 01:26:42.500]  extreme but it's true and it's not just African-Americans and then many good
[01:26:42.500 --> 01:26:45.680]  African-Americans and you and I have great friends great colleagues like
[01:26:45.680 --> 01:26:53.160]  Allen keys and others but if everybody except who he just he despises and he
[01:26:53.160 --> 01:26:58.320]  does but black unemployment has doubled under Obama so it's also rhetorical in
[01:26:58.320 --> 01:27:03.160]  rhetoric he claims he's for black people but in actions he's destroying them I
[01:27:03.160 --> 01:27:06.680]  mean doubling unemployment in black folks in seven years when the other
[01:27:06.680 --> 01:27:10.440]  unemployment hasn't even gone up you know 30% look at this article in
[01:27:10.440 --> 01:27:16.520]  Bloomberg today Obama says racial animus blunts approval New Yorker reports
[01:27:16.520 --> 01:27:20.440]  the Obama says his approval ratings going down because a racist white people
[01:27:20.440 --> 01:27:25.360]  it was white people that voted him in absolutely and we were and although we
[01:27:25.360 --> 01:27:29.240]  didn't like him that was a great thing about this country that it could happen
[01:27:29.240 --> 01:27:33.240]  you know and but we didn't realize that what we were voting in was I mean
[01:27:33.240 --> 01:27:36.960]  ensuring candidate a wolf in sheep's clothing and it's time that we have to
[01:27:36.960 --> 01:27:40.360]  start speaking out not being scared of being called racist and let me be clear
[01:27:40.360 --> 01:27:43.040]  let me be clear you were a little more worried at the time was your you got a
[01:27:43.040 --> 01:27:46.840]  really good instinct but Joseph Farah myself as well but world net daily where
[01:27:46.840 --> 01:27:51.720]  you work great folks Western Journalism Center they wrote the book none of the
[01:27:51.720 --> 01:27:55.520]  above they did not endorse McCain or Obama they said the Republicans are so
[01:27:55.520 --> 01:27:59.720]  bad you know let's see what a Democrat day does and then now Farrah has
[01:27:59.720 --> 01:28:05.400]  basically admitted he was wrong I mean Obama is so bad I can't believe it
[01:28:05.400 --> 01:28:12.520]  place worse than that this is someone who identified with his Muslim side he's
[01:28:12.520 --> 01:28:16.560]  half Muslim his dad was Muslim you can understand how he identifies but see
[01:28:16.560 --> 01:28:19.960]  that's not what this country is about we're not about Sharia law okay we're
[01:28:19.960 --> 01:28:23.400]  not about bending over to Arab states at the expense of Israel we're not about
[01:28:23.400 --> 01:28:27.320]  rules of engagement that say that our troops can't fire unless fired upon
[01:28:27.320 --> 01:28:33.000]  first by Muslim enemy and engaged even Secretary Gates wrote about this
[01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:37.520]  recently they tried to change Obama on this that people are dying for capital
[01:28:37.520 --> 01:28:41.320]  and greater numbers in Afghanistan any war because he doesn't want to take a
[01:28:41.320 --> 01:28:47.160]  risk that a Muslim jihadist might be injured by accident and you have to
[01:28:47.160 --> 01:28:50.800]  say it like it is we have to finish up Larry we're coming back stay there

[01:34:16.120 --> 01:34:21.600]  9-11 in the research there criminal elements in the government basically
[01:34:21.600 --> 01:34:26.400]  stood down and allowed to transpire what transpired then the media picked it up
[01:34:26.400 --> 01:34:30.480]  and said Alex Jones said Bush had a blast plunger doing the bombing no
[01:34:30.480 --> 01:34:34.520]  that's not what I said what I said is what you're seeing right now our
[01:34:34.520 --> 01:34:38.120]  government is funding the radical Muslim Brotherhood that's al-Qaeda like to
[01:34:38.120 --> 01:34:43.280]  attack military bases in Egypt they turn northern Africa from Tunisia right over
[01:34:43.280 --> 01:34:47.880]  to Libya over to al-Qaeda that's 10 20 times worse what was there they are
[01:34:47.880 --> 01:34:54.960]  trying to arm them and supply them to attack Syria they just gave Fallujah to
[01:34:54.960 --> 01:35:00.200]  al-Qaeda they're in central Western Iraq and so they're giving them heavy
[01:35:00.200 --> 01:35:05.600]  weapons they're giving them service to air missiles and under Obama as drum
[01:35:05.600 --> 01:35:08.600]  coursing and others broke on the show months ago it's now come out in the
[01:35:08.600 --> 01:35:13.200]  news in Egypt that indeed the courts have gotten the documents the Muslim
[01:35:13.200 --> 01:35:17.160]  Brotherhood is fencing money through his cousin and others in in Kenya
[01:35:17.160 --> 01:35:21.360]  from the Muslim Brotherhood to the Democratic Party so people can talk all
[01:35:21.360 --> 01:35:24.240]  day about foreign funds to our government I don't like foreign
[01:35:24.240 --> 01:35:30.360]  entanglements outside influence but I know what they call Islam a foe but my
[01:35:30.360 --> 01:35:37.520]  issue is radical Islam I am a foe above and I and it's true that that that
[01:35:37.520 --> 01:35:42.000]  Obama is literally trying to turn the Middle East over to the most radical
[01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:45.200]  people ever and our government's a dabbled and manipulated these people
[01:35:45.200 --> 01:35:49.480]  since the days of Jimmy Carter with with with the Taliban al-Qaeda and all
[01:35:49.480 --> 01:35:54.480]  those operations but now it's so naked that in the past you know I love Larry
[01:35:54.480 --> 01:35:57.960]  in the work he does Larry claiming the top whistleblower lawyer we've got here
[01:35:57.960 --> 01:36:02.240]  who just beat the NSA in court thank God but then they had other court rulings
[01:36:02.240 --> 01:36:06.520]  to try to counter him and other lapdog courts but you know there is that whole
[01:36:06.520 --> 01:36:11.200]  area of this going on what do you think the grand strategy is I think it's more
[01:36:11.200 --> 01:36:17.800]  the socialist left who who really does hate America is using radical Islam as
[01:36:17.800 --> 01:36:21.720]  a fifth column all over Europe you name it because I have seen look at Michael
[01:36:21.720 --> 01:36:26.160]  Savage banned from England from mildly criticizing radical Islam I mean it
[01:36:26.160 --> 01:36:30.640]  really is one of those taboos now that you cannot criticize so I'm somebody
[01:36:30.640 --> 01:36:33.800]  that believes in the First Amendment I mean Obama says you're a racist if you
[01:36:33.800 --> 01:36:38.360]  criticize him well I don't care less what color Obama was if he was a Ron Paul
[01:36:38.360 --> 01:36:41.960]  libertarian type I'd love him I don't care if he had blue skin what do you
[01:36:41.960 --> 01:36:46.120]  think's going on here well I think there's that aspect of it yeah the left
[01:36:46.120 --> 01:36:50.840]  does feel a kinship I mean look even out in Hollywood I'm a Jewish Christian
[01:36:50.840 --> 01:36:55.440]  out I was born Jewish I became a Christian I'm I'm both in effect and I
[01:36:55.440 --> 01:37:01.360]  look at my Jewish brothers so to speak in Hollywood and they would rather
[01:37:01.360 --> 01:37:06.840]  support the Palestinians than Israel I mean it's unbelievable and so you have
[01:37:06.840 --> 01:37:13.400]  an element of the left which you know is atheist which you know really does not
[01:37:13.400 --> 01:37:17.240]  have any Judeo-Christian roots or heritage or anything like that a layer on
[01:37:17.240 --> 01:37:22.600]  top of that Obama who in his heart is a Muslim you know I'm not saying all
[01:37:22.600 --> 01:37:26.960]  Muslims are bad but he is a Muslim who believes in Muslim worldwide revolution
[01:37:26.960 --> 01:37:29.760]  listen listen if he's honest about that that's fine but remember when he gave
[01:37:29.760 --> 01:37:34.680]  that speech in Cairo and he said in perfect Arabic and they were shocked
[01:37:34.680 --> 01:37:38.160]  that I am a Muslim I'm with I mean people don't know that the point of the
[01:37:38.160 --> 01:37:42.600]  president said he is a Muslim in you know in Egypt that's a big deal that was
[01:37:42.600 --> 01:37:47.160]  like five years ago no one talks about that well you know not only that he
[01:37:47.160 --> 01:37:51.120]  didn't like the fact that people were calling him Barack Hussein Obama during
[01:37:51.120 --> 01:37:55.440]  the 2008 campaign introduced himself at the University of Cairo is Hussein
[01:37:55.440 --> 01:38:01.320]  Obama then National Day of Prayer celebration in the White House a year
[01:38:01.320 --> 01:38:05.960]  and a half later he canceled that he feasts Ramadan which is the Muslim
[01:38:05.960 --> 01:38:10.680]  big holiday he uses the occasion to endorse the ground zero mosque in New
[01:38:10.680 --> 01:38:15.320]  York he wears a ring is reported by world net daily and make the pictures of it
[01:38:15.320 --> 01:38:20.360]  how to translate it says my only God is Allah you know people criticized me when
[01:38:20.360 --> 01:38:23.880]  I was in front of the World War two memorial a couple months ago and I said
[01:38:23.880 --> 01:38:28.200]  he bows down to Allah I stand by it he bows down to Allah well he did go to a
[01:38:28.200 --> 01:38:33.000]  Muslim school whenever he was there in Indonesia that's that's on record we
[01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:37.000]  have the school records he doesn't deny it and his name was Barry Cetero so you
[01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:41.200]  know I think he's just a complete front and he's to all groups whatever they are
[01:38:41.200 --> 01:38:45.120]  you know it's like when Hillary went to Kentucky and she went hell y'all doing
[01:38:45.120 --> 01:38:51.720]  now there I'm gonna I mean I think that's what's going on well he is he is he is
[01:38:51.720 --> 01:38:55.920]  we put it that will make a living ensuring candidates the first Muslim
[01:38:55.920 --> 01:38:59.000]  president I don't condemn all Muslims people shouldn't take it that way but
[01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:03.800]  but he's favoring those interests over American interest and over you know
[01:39:03.800 --> 01:39:08.400]  Christian ethics in this country and it's quite obvious and I just think we
[01:39:08.400 --> 01:39:11.640]  have to start saying it like it is you do that's why I love you all I mean well
[01:39:11.640 --> 01:39:14.360]  Larry I'm gonna be honest with you before we go to calls here in this
[01:39:14.360 --> 01:39:16.960]  segment the next and I appreciate you joining us they've got a lot of NSA
[01:39:16.960 --> 01:39:21.520]  questions everybody knows that I've been neutral and stayed out of the whole
[01:39:21.520 --> 01:39:25.440]  Israel-Palestinian deal because I know it's all tribal and it goes on and on but
[01:39:25.440 --> 01:39:30.280]  I've never been bullied more in my life over the last 15 years 18 on air but
[01:39:30.280 --> 01:39:35.160]  the last 15 to demonize Israel and call for its annihilation I've never been
[01:39:35.160 --> 01:39:38.560]  death-threaded more I've never had more lies made up I've never been
[01:39:38.560 --> 01:39:45.200]  persecuted more by the anti-Israel crowd it is literally a religion to hate
[01:39:45.200 --> 01:39:48.640]  Israel and Jews when Jews are incredibly diverse people some my best
[01:39:48.640 --> 01:39:52.800]  friends are Jews and so they've almost bullied me Larry over to the other side
[01:39:52.800 --> 01:39:58.560]  by attacking me because I was neutral well and what is Israel Israel home of
[01:39:58.560 --> 01:40:02.880]  Jewish and Christian people the greatest Jew that ever was was Jesus Christ I
[01:40:02.880 --> 01:40:07.960]  mean it belongs to both of us and it's our foundation and if it ceases to
[01:40:07.960 --> 01:40:12.080]  exist I don't think we'll last much longer either so our features are tied
[01:40:12.080 --> 01:40:16.200]  but quite apart from that as we were saying with the rules of engagement is
[01:40:16.200 --> 01:40:21.600]  that this president does everything he can to harm American interests and to
[01:40:21.600 --> 01:40:25.560]  harm you know Christian interests you know and favor Muslim interests and I
[01:40:25.560 --> 01:40:32.280]  stand by what I said well it's just incredible that it is such a fancy
[01:40:32.280 --> 01:40:36.920]  popular thing to not even they use Israel as an excuse to demonize Jews
[01:40:36.920 --> 01:40:40.560]  period when Jews are such a diverse group of people like any other group I'm
[01:40:40.560 --> 01:40:44.840]  just sick of it I'm sick of race politics that Obama invokes saying you're
[01:40:44.840 --> 01:40:48.600]  racist if you don't agree with Obamacare or you're racist if you don't like me
[01:40:48.600 --> 01:40:52.800]  he said that to the New Yorker this week and you know what I could I mean I am I
[01:40:52.800 --> 01:40:57.800]  am Larry I'm very angry about being called a racist by MSNBC with no proof
[01:40:57.800 --> 01:41:01.720]  they called me deeply racist not that they called me racist but that they're
[01:41:01.720 --> 01:41:07.000]  such liars well thank God for Alan West who came out this week too that Obama's
[01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:13.000]  racist against whites let's start pushing back Alex is no I agree I agree he
[01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:18.080]  you know what he is a racist he is a racist and that's the problem and that's
[01:41:18.080 --> 01:41:22.480]  what's dividing this country and that's why we're in a very volatile situation we
[01:41:22.480 --> 01:41:27.920]  need a president and leadership is going to bring people together not divide them
[01:41:27.920 --> 01:41:31.360]  exactly I want to like Martin Luther to recognize what our roots were what our
[01:41:31.360 --> 01:41:33.880]  founding roots for that doesn't mean people that don't get the worst it's
[01:41:33.880 --> 01:41:36.480]  really in this country doesn't mean you should pursue it on the base of your
[01:41:36.480 --> 01:41:40.600]  beliefs but yes the foundation of our legal system sure is it a break legal
[01:41:40.600 --> 01:41:44.880]  legal well Christians are being persecuted all over the place in this
[01:41:44.880 --> 01:41:48.360]  country what about what about them being protected you know why does the left
[01:41:48.360 --> 01:41:52.360]  persecute Christians but then claim that they're open why does Cuomo say we
[01:41:52.360 --> 01:41:57.560]  don't accept pro livers and gun owners in New York that's not who we are that's
[01:41:57.560 --> 01:42:01.680]  the ultimate form of not being conclusive that's the ultimate form of
[01:42:01.680 --> 01:42:08.680]  being prejudiced it's the ultimate form of being discriminatory absolutely now
[01:42:08.680 --> 01:42:13.800]  it is a war and we have to call it what it is it is legally speaking I don't
[01:42:13.800 --> 01:42:18.240]  mean this in a violent way us or them there's no middle ground and to pretend
[01:42:18.240 --> 01:42:25.360]  that there is with these you know radical ultra leftist communists atheists and
[01:42:25.360 --> 01:42:28.920]  you and Alex after this interview we should call up right-wing watch see
[01:42:28.920 --> 01:42:33.720]  what they say about us yeah yeah yeah yeah I love all these White House run
[01:42:33.720 --> 01:42:36.280]  groups claim they have the moral authority and they list who's bad who's
[01:42:36.280 --> 01:42:40.280]  not yeah I mean their sorrows sorrows funded groups you know sorrows plus
[01:42:40.280 --> 01:42:44.920]  throws he and his dad were Jewish they are Jewish they sold out Jews in a
[01:42:44.920 --> 01:42:49.460]  World War two day off Hitler I know I know I know and if you criticize that
[01:42:49.460 --> 01:42:53.920]  you're anti-semitic by the way he's hired a sorrows known front guy to run

[01:46:07.520 --> 01:46:11.520]  several years ago Matt was sitting in his two bedroom apartment frustrated with
[01:46:11.520 --> 01:46:14.840]  the direction this country was headed and the charlatans willing to sell us
[01:46:14.840 --> 01:46:19.340]  out for a quick buck deciding to take action a company run by patriots for
[01:46:19.340 --> 01:46:23.680]  patriots was born my Patriots supply has never taken a loan or accepted

[01:47:23.480 --> 01:47:31.120]  you want answers well so does he live from Austin Texas broadcasting
[01:47:31.120 --> 01:47:47.120]  worldwide it's Alex Jones. I don't feel no ways tired. I come too far from where I started from. Nobody told me that the road would be easy.
[01:47:47.120 --> 01:47:52.760]  That's like when Rick Perry the governor of Texas went out to California and went
[01:47:52.760 --> 01:48:01.720]  hello good to see you to Hispanic people I am a Rick Perry. Nothing is more
[01:48:01.720 --> 01:48:07.080]  annoying than that just talk like you talk man. It's unbelievable I've seen
[01:48:07.080 --> 01:48:11.160]  people at restaurants like look at somebody who they think Hispanic and go
[01:48:11.160 --> 01:48:17.600]  hello how you do. They go I speak English quite well thank you but that's the
[01:48:17.600 --> 01:48:20.720]  same thing Hillary does and it's what these politicians do and I guess they
[01:48:20.720 --> 01:48:24.240]  think it works and I think that's what's going on here whether you're Muslim
[01:48:24.240 --> 01:48:28.440]  Christian Jewish agnostic as long as you love the Billarized Constitution
[01:48:28.440 --> 01:48:34.520]  private property the family do process I'm your friend but clearly with the
[01:48:34.520 --> 01:48:37.840]  Democratic Party they have gone over the deep end and so the Republicans
[01:48:37.840 --> 01:48:41.040]  they're backing down to all this because the corporate special interests will do
[01:48:41.040 --> 01:48:45.200]  anything to get control of the government. Larry Clemens our guest let's
[01:48:45.200 --> 01:48:48.560]  jam in a bunch of calls this final 10-minute segment here till I'm back
[01:48:48.560 --> 01:48:51.920]  tomorrow at 11 a.m. Central with a weekday transmission showtimes and
[01:48:51.920 --> 01:48:57.440]  links info wars.com find the free podcast there as well Chris no Chris is
[01:48:57.440 --> 01:49:01.760]  next but Alexander in Wisconsin you're up first go ahead you got a question or
[01:49:01.760 --> 01:49:08.520]  comment for Larry Clemens. Hi Larry and hi Alex I kind of have a open-ended
[01:49:08.520 --> 01:49:14.280]  question that I need to prelude first. First personally this is kind of tough
[01:49:14.280 --> 01:49:17.640]  for me to go through this whole economic situation because the bank is
[01:49:17.640 --> 01:49:21.120]  scooping up my family business and the house and I'm a victim of this economy
[01:49:21.120 --> 01:49:25.480]  and the generation as a millennial. In regards to the NSA I would like to ask
[01:49:25.480 --> 01:49:30.240]  you a question curious rather curious of your response. First I must prelude this
[01:49:30.240 --> 01:49:37.880]  with how science spawns policy and policy dictates politics. The BS or Bravo
[01:49:37.880 --> 01:49:42.520]  Sierra overload policy what policy wise we are observing now is as the
[01:49:42.520 --> 01:49:47.600]  establishment has or in the process of discovering its own Bravo Sierra that
[01:49:47.600 --> 01:49:51.680] 's why it has come so extreme and outrageous and this science has
[01:49:51.680 --> 01:49:55.520]  undoubtedly given them a deep and powerful and extremely detailed and
[01:49:55.520 --> 01:50:00.520]  recording outline of not only the individual level but as the mass of
[01:50:00.520 --> 01:50:06.040]  society. Sure the NSA is about putting out BS and seeing how it's received to
[01:50:06.040 --> 01:50:11.160]  manipulate because you know you have you need to be able to see something. Yep.
[01:50:11.160 --> 01:50:14.760]  All right so analyze through this analyze all that through cutting-edge
[01:50:14.760 --> 01:50:18.840]  algorithms, mathematics, R&D, and quantum-powered supercomputing they know
[01:50:18.840 --> 01:50:24.200]  what's up as you and I both agree what open-minded or empowered individuals must
[01:50:24.200 --> 01:50:28.240]  focus on is now themselves as an individual and to conquer the enemy
[01:50:28.240 --> 01:50:34.200]  within. The programming delicious eye candy wash they have created is
[01:50:34.200 --> 01:50:38.360]  this enemy and goodness will flush it out of us. We are feeling this on
[01:50:38.360 --> 01:50:42.520]  either like a semi-perceed level or unknowingly depending on your personal
[01:50:42.520 --> 01:50:45.520]  no I hear you but I got to go I appreciate your call I got to get to
[01:50:45.520 --> 01:50:48.440]  other people I should have gone to calls earlier. Larry Kleinman very interesting
[01:50:48.440 --> 01:50:55.240]  points he makes about the NSA. Yeah well you know the NSA Alex as we talked
[01:50:55.240 --> 01:51:00.560]  about they're just the tool they're the vehicle for the ruling establishment to
[01:51:00.560 --> 01:51:05.360]  keep us down and they have a legitimate purpose to spy on terrorists people
[01:51:05.360 --> 01:51:08.880]  who are communicating with terrorists but they have no legitimate purpose in
[01:51:08.880 --> 01:51:14.160]  getting the metadata telephone-wise and internet-wise of all of us and all of
[01:51:14.160 --> 01:51:18.280]  these policy arguments as to what a shooter should not be doing really it's
[01:51:18.280 --> 01:51:22.680]  just the smoke screen for them to be able to continue to terrorize the American
[01:51:22.680 --> 01:51:28.160]  people. Exactly they're using it again. Yeah and and Republicans are doing
[01:51:28.160 --> 01:51:32.960]  on behalf of both. Let's talk to Ted in Tennessee I'm gonna skip ahead to him he
[01:51:32.960 --> 01:51:38.520]  says he's in favor of the NSA is this a joke you like North Korea or are you
[01:51:38.520 --> 01:51:44.640]  serious Ted? I am a hundred percent serious Alex hello Larry hello here's my
[01:51:44.640 --> 01:51:50.400]  idea lying has become pervasive in Washington and in big business the
[01:51:50.400 --> 01:51:55.760]  reason why our economy sucks is people have been lied to and cheated now if the
[01:51:55.760 --> 01:52:00.560]  NSA has all this data that's gone through all these big business
[01:52:00.560 --> 01:52:06.280]  conversations and they don't know what the NSA has they're gonna stop lying
[01:52:06.280 --> 01:52:11.840]  they're not going to cheat as much people. No big business knows it's all
[01:52:11.840 --> 01:52:19.000]  selectively enforced. The first time this data will be grabbed by a lawyer
[01:52:19.000 --> 01:52:23.480]  will probably be during a divorce trial. Now here they don't give it to lawyers
[01:52:23.480 --> 01:52:28.400]  they don't give it to defense people it's only used by select insiders. No the
[01:52:28.400 --> 01:52:33.720]  entire economy of Washington is lobbying which is lawyers one of those
[01:52:33.720 --> 01:52:38.280]  lawyers is gonna get some of this and then they'll be open to everybody and
[01:52:38.280 --> 01:52:44.160]  we will be able to stop the secrecy that has been taking all the economy away
[01:52:44.160 --> 01:52:48.360]  for the people. Well I agree it's a double-edged sword but but but listen
[01:52:48.360 --> 01:52:52.680]  it's a double-edged sword but it's this argument as if the NSA are good guys the
[01:52:52.680 --> 01:52:58.120]  data is not given but to a select group who used it as the ultimate currency of
[01:52:58.120 --> 01:53:02.000]  control. Larry Klayman I appreciate your call Ted in Tennessee go ahead Larry.
[01:53:02.000 --> 01:53:07.840]  Well it's not that select you're right and we don't know the complete extent
[01:53:07.840 --> 01:53:11.080]  of what they're doing which is why we filed suit and it's why we're asking
[01:53:11.080 --> 01:53:15.000]  the judge to let us get into the underwear so to speak of the NSA and
[01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:19.320]  the ruling establishment. The very fact that they're getting everybody's
[01:53:19.320 --> 01:53:24.200]  metadata everybody that they have access to it there've been two thousand seven
[01:53:24.200 --> 01:53:28.120]  hundred violations of the law that even the NSA had to admit to in the last
[01:53:28.120 --> 01:53:32.840]  years. Twelve instances that they had to admit to where people inside the NSA
[01:53:32.840 --> 01:53:37.160]  were using these capabilities to spy on their girlfriends, cousins, or friends or
[01:53:37.160 --> 01:53:42.720]  wives. It's out of control and you don't know what they're gonna do with it but
[01:53:42.720 --> 01:53:47.520]  the reality is the very fact that it's out there and we know it exists and that
[01:53:47.520 --> 01:53:51.880]  we can't make a call without thinking about what we're saying anymore tells
[01:53:51.880 --> 01:53:55.200]  you what state we're in in terms of our freedom so we can't allow this to continue
[01:53:55.200 --> 01:54:00.480]  if it does. Exactly. And it does continue this country is going to explode ultimately.
[01:54:00.480 --> 01:54:04.560]  Absolutely. Well we know they're using it to persecute the press. Boom arrest them
[01:54:04.560 --> 01:54:08.720]  all right there. If we don't it's such the precedent that they're god like Kim
[01:54:08.720 --> 01:54:12.240]  Jung-un of North Korea with Dennis Rodman. I mean you know they've got spying
[01:54:12.240 --> 01:54:15.520]  there they know best trust them. I mean Kim Jung-un's like your like your
[01:54:15.520 --> 01:54:19.920]  neighbor he's like Paul Revere. Obama said so. Kristen, New Jersey you're on the
[01:54:19.920 --> 01:54:26.040]  air go ahead. Hey Alex I just want to say thank you very much real quick because
[01:54:26.040 --> 01:54:29.840]  I know we're running out of time. I want to say I'm with you about impeaching
[01:54:29.840 --> 01:54:34.320]  Obama. I live in New Jersey. I'm sick of this Chris Christie. My daughter comes
[01:54:34.320 --> 01:54:37.760]  home talking about how the teachers say we got to forgive him. What kind of
[01:54:37.760 --> 01:54:42.080]  message are we sending to our youth? These people are liars get them out impeached.
[01:54:42.080 --> 01:54:45.720]  Well yeah I mean look Chris Christie is really a Democrat and he's using
[01:54:45.720 --> 01:54:49.920]  government to harass people and hold people hostage. Yeah your take on Chris
[01:54:49.920 --> 01:54:55.160]  Christie. Larry Klayman. Well yeah I mean obviously wasn't telling the truth you
[01:54:55.160 --> 01:55:00.680]  know he whatever he is and he's not one of my favorite politically. He deep-fixed
[01:55:00.680 --> 01:55:05.000]  Romney. Romney's not the greatest thanks to the sliced bread either but he could
[01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:10.040]  have gone a long way to at least saving this country in part. The point is he was
[01:55:10.040 --> 01:55:14.320]  a Democratic Party operative. He should have at least been neutral. He aided Obama.
[01:55:14.320 --> 01:55:20.760]  He is a Rhino period. That's right. That's right. He's nothing. Okay so you know
[01:55:20.760 --> 01:55:26.600]  move on. Let's let's go ahead and go. Not you but Chris. No no I agree. Next caller
[01:55:26.600 --> 01:55:31.720]  Ashley in Wisconsin. You're on the air. Go ahead. Good evening gentlemen. Thank you
[01:55:31.720 --> 01:55:35.360]  for taking my call. I really appreciate it. Thank you. Very important Mr. Jones. I
[01:55:35.360 --> 01:55:41.240]  really want to say when you came out the Nathan iodine I thought it was in a
[01:55:41.240 --> 01:55:47.160]  dye because I was having so many pains from rupturing cysts on the ovaries in
[01:55:47.160 --> 01:55:51.400]  the uterus and when I heard Dr. Group come out and say it's for polycystic
[01:55:51.400 --> 01:55:56.160]  polycystic ovarian syndrome and the iodine helps with that. Yes ma'am we're
[01:55:56.160 --> 01:55:59.560]  doing we're doing NSA stuff and listen even though I like you plugging
[01:55:59.560 --> 01:56:03.800]  plugging our products the Nathan iodine. I haven't on the state point. Can I make the
[01:56:03.800 --> 01:56:09.400]  on the state point then? Okay go ahead. Okay also you saved my life with the iodine but anyway. Thank you. I keep having this
[01:56:09.400 --> 01:56:12.760]  reoccurring dream. People keep asking me why are they collecting this data Ashley?
[01:56:12.760 --> 01:56:16.720]  Why are they collecting it? I keep having these thoughts about you said a
[01:56:16.720 --> 01:56:20.440]  couple days ago Alex but that the enemy will have their day and only their day.
[01:56:20.440 --> 01:56:24.840]  Well one that when that's on a perdition does take it plus it's fake plastic
[01:56:24.840 --> 01:56:30.080]  thrown they're gonna have years and years of data okay and they're gonna throw
[01:56:30.080 --> 01:56:32.800]  it against the American people and people throughout the world and say look
[01:56:32.800 --> 01:56:35.520]  we are God. We know you're a little speaker with you know all this stuff
[01:56:35.520 --> 01:56:38.760]  about you what you did with your grandma this year that year and people are gonna
[01:56:38.760 --> 01:56:42.280]  really freaked out. Yeah no no they want to play God they want to be omnipresent
[01:56:42.280 --> 01:56:46.720]  yeah. They're gonna make people feel like they know everything from these
[01:56:46.720 --> 01:56:50.760]  years and the clots of data that they have but I want to tell people that they
[01:56:50.760 --> 01:56:55.200]  have to remember that only the good Lord Tommy no no Tommy hairs are on your
[01:56:55.200 --> 01:57:00.280]  head. I agree plus they always can Larry claiming we're out of time Larry
[01:57:00.280 --> 01:57:03.960]  claiming briefly and I gotta get you back on I appreciate you taking calls
[01:57:03.960 --> 01:57:07.440]  appreciate the callers amount of time to all those on hold. What about the fact
[01:57:07.440 --> 01:57:11.320]  that the government's famous for putting fake data in that's my big concern is
[01:57:11.320 --> 01:57:15.880]  they can claim the NSA got something and then it's not even real. Well yeah
[01:57:15.880 --> 01:57:20.160]  government can set you up it's true during the Clinton years in particular
[01:57:20.160 --> 01:57:24.520]  I had to go to Brazil a couple times through Peter Paul who had the good
[01:57:24.520 --> 01:57:28.520]  son Hillary Clinton and Bill Clinton you can read about it on our website it's
[01:57:28.520 --> 01:57:34.600]  freedomwatchUSA.org and you know I was always worried that when I would go on
[01:57:34.600 --> 01:57:38.120]  the plane so I just luggage with myself that they could plan something in my
[01:57:38.120 --> 01:57:42.520]  back. Absolutely Larry we're out of time great job we'll talk to you soon I'll
[01:57:42.520 --> 01:57:46.840]  see everybody back tomorrow 11 a.m. Central with a weekday show infowars.com
[01:57:46.840 --> 01:58:09.120]  great job crew God bless you all.
