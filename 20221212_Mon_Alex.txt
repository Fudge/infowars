[00:00.000 --> 00:25.000]  Infowars, tomorrow's news, today.
[00:25.000 --> 00:47.000]  Send in the clowns, don't bother, they're here.
[00:47.000 --> 01:06.000]  Isn't it rich? Isn't it queer? Losing my timing this late in my career.
[01:06.000 --> 01:33.000]  Where are the clowns? There ought to be clowns. Well, maybe next year.
[01:33.000 --> 01:38.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us. It's Monday, December 12, 2022.
[01:38.000 --> 01:42.000]  I am your embattled host, Alex Jones, but wouldn't want to be anywhere else.
[01:42.000 --> 01:49.000]  We've had such devastating effects on the New World Order and their criminal planetary takeover and depopulation plan.
[01:49.000 --> 01:56.000]  We are fighting back together and I salute and thank you all for joining us here today.
[01:56.000 --> 02:06.000]  All right, I'm not going to sit here and have the ongoing debate. People are welcome to call in if they want, and guest hosts can say whatever they want.
[02:06.000 --> 02:14.000]  But I don't want to just have the ongoing debate about whether Elon Musk is a good guy or a bad guy. What matters is his actions, and I don't trust him.
[02:14.000 --> 02:27.000]  But his actions speak louder than words, and he is really devastating the deep state, and he legitimately has them on the run, very scared with the last three Twitter drops he did.
[02:27.000 --> 02:39.000]  And the fourth one that he says, and we already know this from behind the scenes stuff that's already leaked, that Fauci was coordinating censorship of thousands of doctors, thousands of nurses and scientists.
[02:39.000 --> 02:52.000]  Well, I say thousands, tens of thousands around the world, not just here. And then he lied to Congress about that, and he lied two weeks ago, or a week and a half ago, to the attorney generals of Missouri and Louisiana.
[02:52.000 --> 02:58.000]  And 260-something times said he didn't do something or he didn't remember, he didn't recall.
[02:58.000 --> 03:17.000]  So this is a big deal, and that's why all the globalists are crawling off one of their rocks and defending Fauci right now, and all the horrible criminal activity he engaged in, like suppressing all of the different therapeutics out there that they already had studies on that they knew would knock these viral infections in the dirt.
[03:17.000 --> 03:33.000]  And that's just one area of the crimes they committed. So this is just super good news, very, very positive information. We're going to be going all through that coming up next segment.
[03:33.000 --> 04:02.000]  Then we've got the border situation with Title 42 set to expire, and deportations down 90% this year compared to last year with Biden, and massive caravans, here's a new one coming across at El Paso, 24-7, as services are cut off to the American people and we're told to go without.
[04:02.000 --> 04:11.000]  The very same globalist policies have fully collapsed. Many areas in the third world, and now they're flooding them here. This is the UN plan.
[04:11.000 --> 04:26.000]  If you're a radio listener, you can't see this, but shocking footage of just a massive, massive caravan, they estimate to be more than 10,000 people for hours after hour after hour after hour after hour, flooding into Texas.
[04:26.000 --> 04:36.000]  And being taken by the Democrats, signed up for welfare, which the Democrats then skim, and then they're also then put in basically sweatshops.
[04:36.000 --> 04:42.000]  So they're exploiting these people. Let's get that straight. I don't hate the poor folks trying to get a better life, though they're being used as a weapon against us all.
[04:42.000 --> 04:45.000]  This is a nightmare scenario. We've got that situation.
[04:45.000 --> 04:56.000]  Rand Paul's come out with some powerful statements about the eugenics movement through the trans movement targeting our children. Russia is threatening nuclear war at another level now. It's all coming up today.
[05:15.000 --> 05:29.000]  We're in a new deal with a big national shipping company, and they're able to cut our regular shipping cost by up to 50%. So that means even on orders that are below $50, you're going to be paying way lower than you were previously.
[05:29.000 --> 05:39.000]  This is a game changer. We're so excited about it. Our listeners had really asked for free shipping again. We couldn't afford it before, but by moving to a bigger national distributor, we're able to do it.
[05:39.000 --> 05:51.000]  Now, your orders will be shipped even faster, the same great customer service and more. So get huge discounts and free shipping on so many great items at infowarstore.com right now.
[05:51.000 --> 06:11.000]  I want to thank you all for your support, but now there's no excuse to boost your immune system, lead a healthier life, and keep invoices on the air at infowarstore.com.
[06:21.000 --> 06:36.000]  infowarstore.com studios. It's Alex Jones.
[06:36.000 --> 06:46.000]  It's Monday, December 12, 2022. I'm your host, Alex Jones. And do we have an incredibly jam-packed broadcast lined up for you today?
[06:46.000 --> 07:02.000]  Good news. U.S. to announce fusion energy breakthrough today. The Department of Energy plans to announce today that scientists have been able for the first time to produce a fusion reaction that creates a net energy gain, a major milestone,
[07:02.000 --> 07:18.000]  the decade-long multi-billion-dollar quest to develop a technology that provides unlimited, cheap, clean power. Free energy. Now, the word is from my sources that they had successfully done this in the 70s.
[07:18.000 --> 07:38.000]  But now, because the Japanese and the Chinese and the Russians are set to make their announcements, the deep state over here is making theirs. You saw a month ago, the Chinese off their coast launched an artificial sun in the atmosphere that lasted 20 minutes.
[07:38.000 --> 07:56.000]  By the way, it's very dangerous to create those on the planet, obviously, because they could get enough purchase in the atmosphere to be able to start expanding and then you could destroy the planet, or potentially large parts of it,
[07:56.000 --> 08:12.000]  depending on how bad the explosion got. Similar problems with the superconducting supercollider or the megacyclotron CERN that spans multinations in Europe, in France and Switzerland.
[08:12.000 --> 08:32.000]  U.S. to announce fusion energy breakthrough. Wow, that is a really, really big deal. Now, notice they're giving us windmills that don't work and batteries that take more carbon to produce and to charge and to use than gas cars.
[08:32.000 --> 08:42.000]  And they've been really suppressing a lot of these new technologies for decades that the establishment calls disruptive technologies.
[08:42.000 --> 08:56.000]  But I'd be all four electric cars if we had enough of the rare earth minerals to replace them, but they don't have, they admit, with discoverable resources, enough to make 10% of the cars on earth battery powered.
[08:56.000 --> 09:06.000]  Then the batteries only last five years on average, and then you don't have any more batteries. So it doesn't matter how much free energy you've got, where are you going to store it?
[09:06.000 --> 09:19.000]  Because they can't put a nuclear fusion reactor in a car. These things are the size of a town. So, again, that's the issue.
[09:19.000 --> 09:30.000]  And they're now, by the way, in the news admitting this, the UN, the club of Rome, the demo stripper like Klaus Schwab, she does go, there is not enough cobalt and enough lithium for the batteries.
[09:30.000 --> 09:40.000]  We need to get people out of the cars. No more used car. So they behave like, oh, everything's going to be electric. Oh, that's what we're getting rid of the gas.
[09:40.000 --> 09:57.000]  No, they're getting rid of the general public having access to cars. Obama told Africans, before he left office, if you remember, seven, eight years ago, we played the clip probably 100 times, he said, you can't have air conditioning or a car, the earth will burn up.
[09:57.000 --> 10:07.000]  So they can have all their private jets and oceanfront property, because they say, you know, by 2017, we'd be two feet under water, but they knew that was all a lie.
[10:07.000 --> 10:18.000]  So yes, you can create these nuclear fusion reactors, they don't blow up on you, and you could power the electrical grid.
[10:18.000 --> 10:36.000]  But you've got big problems storing the electricity. You know, most the electricity electrical grid is not stored. It's all being produced as they need it as the computers estimate usage.
[10:36.000 --> 10:54.000]  And so they are not building the infrastructure at any level that we need to transfer ourselves over to this new system.
[10:54.000 --> 11:10.000]  They're promising all this magical technology but not deploying it, not developing it for public use or public good, while they cut off all the resources to the general public because the vast majority of people and their progeny are not supposed to go into the future.
[11:10.000 --> 11:23.000]  And that's what the euthanasia and the infanticide and the death panels and the transgenderism is all about in the fine print depopulating.
[11:23.000 --> 11:37.000]  Well, how do you sterilize kids? You teach them it's cool and trendy and take away parental rights when they're five, six years old and put them on the path when they're 10 to have their genitals actually cut off or their breasts actually cut off,
[11:37.000 --> 11:56.000]  or when they're six to start taking puberty blockers and now children's books and boxes of cereal in the schools are all there 24 seven over and over and over again.
[11:56.000 --> 12:08.000]  When a child is five or six or seven, they are asexual, meaning not sexual to a great degree, because their hormones have not kicked in.
[12:08.000 --> 12:17.000]  So a little girl doesn't think of herself as a little girl, a little boy doesn't think of themselves as little boy, think of themselves as little creatures learning from adults and society and culture.
[12:17.000 --> 12:27.000]  Just like a baby deer doesn't think about sex until it goes into puberty, or a baby dog, a wolf, a cub, a pop.
[12:27.000 --> 12:36.000]  A baby bear doesn't think about sex until it goes into puberty, and then all those instincts and everything kicks in.
[12:36.000 --> 12:50.000]  So they go to try to artificially come in as social engineers with an army of pedophiles who do their bidding, who want access to children, to have children be confused and say maybe I am a boy when you're a girl, or maybe you are a girl when you're a boy.
[12:50.000 --> 13:05.000]  And then they create a relationship with you in the state, in a computer, to now cut you out, put you in your own classes, but peer pressure on you to then sterilize you and then have you celebrate that.
[13:05.000 --> 13:13.000]  And now we've got footage all over the country of the so-called gay pride parades that are now basically pedophile coming out parades that we can't even show you.
[13:13.000 --> 13:26.000]  This is mild compared of children being paraded in front of men who are completely naked and people urinating and defecating on each other.
[13:26.000 --> 13:42.000]  If somebody came up to your child in the park, a man or woman and said I want to talk to you about your sexual preferences or I want to talk to you about your body and maybe you're not really a girl or a boy, you'd call the police and then go to jail, or they'd be investigated.
[13:42.000 --> 13:57.000]  Nowadays, if it's state-sponsored, government-sponsored, sponsored by Disney, sponsored by Wells Fargo, sponsored by Bank of America, sponsored by Goldman Sachs, sponsored by JP Morgan, who do sponsor it worldwide,
[13:57.000 --> 14:15.000]  well then you take your children in an offering to it to show how you submit to the system and then in some cases men with erections, with only glitter on their penises, have little boys and girls sit on their genitals in front of everyone and the women all get these wild looks in their eyes because they know it's degenerate,
[14:15.000 --> 14:32.000]  they know it's sick, they know it's extremely taboo because it's bad and horrible and ruins these children's innocence, but they say we don't care, we're here to groom your children, we're here for the next generation, you will not stop us because they have the full backing of the power structure.
[14:32.000 --> 14:47.000]  And Senator Rand Paul's come out and said Republicans are not perfect, but they are not pushing your child to have surgery to remove their genitals. I'm going to get to that clip first and talk about the culture wars, then I'm going to get into the fourth drop of the Twitter files that's imminent.
[14:47.000 --> 15:06.000]  As we already know from documents that leaked elsewhere that Fauci and the rest of his crew were censoring millions of people and tens of thousands of scientists and doctors in live time, shadow banning or blocking or full out banning and then going out and not letting people talk about therapeutics or studies about vitamin C or vitamin D or hydroxychloroquine or
[15:06.000 --> 15:20.000]  you just went on and on, or they'd suppress you if you exposed that Rendezavier would turn your kidneys off and wouldn't protect you, or when they would admit the files two years ago that oh these shots really won't help you, they'll erase your immune system.
[15:20.000 --> 15:31.000]  If you tried to publish a study showing that, you'd get banned. That's criminals from the beginning suppressing the knowledge and censoring, but we overpowered them together.
[15:31.000 --> 15:42.000]  And now the day both crew admits if they can't censor the people of the world, they're going to lose their new permanent lockdown they're preparing and China's had to just snap its fingers and end its lockdown because the public finally revolted.
[15:42.000 --> 15:55.000]  Thomas Jefferson was asked what tyranny will man live under and how bad will tyranny get? He said tyranny will get as bad as you let it get because there's always a tyrant worse than the last who will push the envelope.
[15:55.000 --> 16:09.000]  We'll be right back. Stay with us Christmas 2022 is almost here and we have great products at infowarstore.com that empower your body, your libido, your immune system that just enrich your life.

[18:24.000 --> 18:34.000]  We're continuing to support info wars despite the massive law fair being waged against info wars despite the media defamatory libelous campaign against info wars.
[18:34.000 --> 18:50.000]  The ordinary people, the everyday people that buy products that make their own lives healthier, wealthier and wiser is what keeps info wars on the air and what that does is keep the populist message alive in an era and an age of totalitarian oppression.
[18:50.000 --> 19:01.000]  Continue to do it, go to places like infowarstore.com, go to places like save info wars, continue to keep info wars alive because in the process you're keeping American liberty alive.
[19:21.000 --> 19:28.000]  The rose hips contained within are a part of the rose flower just below the petals that contain the rose plant seeds.
[19:28.000 --> 19:39.000]  Natural chemicals found in the hips may even be helpful for a variety of health conditions including those with osteoarthritis and for those with pain after surgery studies have shown.
[19:39.000 --> 19:48.000]  As for vitamin C and zinc themselves you probably already know that they play an important role in nutrition, immune defense and the maintenance of your everyday health.
[19:48.000 --> 19:55.000]  It has been reported that intake of both is often inadequate even in affluent populations like here in America.
[19:55.000 --> 20:23.000]  When you visit be sure to check it out at infowarstore.com where we promise our rose hips don't lie.
[20:23.000 --> 20:32.000]  So earlier I pointed out that they're not bringing out electric cars so that they can replace all the cars electric cars.
[20:32.000 --> 20:42.000]  It's all a lie, they admit that and now the World Economic Forum has come out and said it's calling for an end to private car ownership period.
[20:42.000 --> 20:45.000]  You will own nothing and you will like it.
[20:45.000 --> 20:59.000]  But I wanted to get to this stack because Greg Reese has done a really powerful report breaking this down and you have to understand the Tabistock Institute of the 60s developed the transgender issue and then rolled it out.
[20:59.000 --> 21:05.000]  And now the last decades of pushing it hard to again train people to sterilize their children and then it's a cool fun thing.
[21:05.000 --> 21:07.000]  It's all mind control.
[21:07.000 --> 21:15.000]  So Senator Paul came out and said Republicans are not perfect, but they're not pushing your child to have surgery to remove their genitals.
[21:15.000 --> 21:25.000]  And more and more people that were brainwashed and told when they were young that they should take puberty blockers or be sterilized are now filing lawsuits and going public.
[21:25.000 --> 21:37.000]  Chloe Cole looks to me like a nuclear missile aimed at the gender industrial complex and it's supporting ideology and its profits in her lawsuit.
[21:37.000 --> 21:44.000]  It's past the initial motions and smiths things will get very interesting very fast and many others will file and it's already beginning.
[21:44.000 --> 21:54.000]  Meanwhile mainstream corporate media is saying classic beautiful women in swimsuits or in tight clothes are bad and is anti woman.
[21:54.000 --> 22:10.000]  The left doesn't want the image of women powerful and beautiful and their classical femininity, but they want to say fatally men dressed like clowns who call themselves admirals and who run major federal departments are good.
[22:10.000 --> 22:14.000]  They know exactly what they're doing and they're also promoting extreme obesity.
[22:14.000 --> 22:16.000]  Look, I'm a little overweight.
[22:16.000 --> 22:17.000]  I'm not against people that are overweight.
[22:17.000 --> 22:18.000]  I don't hate them for it.
[22:18.000 --> 22:26.000]  But when the media says the corporations say you should celebrate it and you should get fatter and fatter and fatter.
[22:26.000 --> 22:28.000]  And then collapse and die.
[22:28.000 --> 22:31.000]  It's again another nihilistic attack.
[22:31.000 --> 22:41.000]  Here's Senator Paul talking about the true evil of the Democratic Party and it's the same with leftist parties worldwide with big money, big pharma money.
[22:41.000 --> 22:45.000]  Trying to come in and literally mutilate children.
[22:45.000 --> 22:46.000]  Here it is.
[22:46.000 --> 22:50.000]  Now Kentucky Senator Rand Paul, Senator, good to see you tonight.
[22:50.000 --> 23:00.000]  This meant this mental health crisis that our children are suffering from now, given everything that you've seen in your medical background.
[23:00.000 --> 23:05.000]  What are the main culprits here?
[23:05.000 --> 23:10.000]  Well, there's no secret who was involved with the lockdowns and I think the lockdowns haven't had an impact.
[23:10.000 --> 23:21.000]  In June of 2020, three months into this, I said, we got to go back to school that it was a mistake to take the kids out of school because they weren't becoming ill with COVID and they weren't dying from COVID.
[23:21.000 --> 23:27.000]  Sweden took this advice, kept their schools open and not one child died that was going to school.
[23:27.000 --> 23:31.000]  They actually didn't wear masks in school and still not one child died in schools.
[23:31.000 --> 23:34.000]  The teachers didn't get any sicker than any other profession.
[23:34.000 --> 23:37.000]  So the lockdowns was a big part of this.
[23:37.000 --> 23:43.000]  But also you have to imagine that the, and who's responsible, Dr. Fauci, he continued to press for these.
[23:43.000 --> 23:51.000]  But who is also responsible for telling a four-year-old that we need to talk about their gender and whether they're in the appropriate body.
[23:51.000 --> 23:59.000]  Who's talking about giving picture books to six-year-olds with illustrations of surgery to remove their genitalia.
[23:59.000 --> 24:03.000]  It's Democrat politicians and woke left-wing people.
[24:03.000 --> 24:13.000]  There's not one Republican look, Republicans are not perfect, but Republicans are not pushing your child to have surgery to remove their genitalia as early as elementary school.
[24:13.000 --> 24:15.000]  No Republican is pushing this.
[24:15.000 --> 24:18.000]  These are crazy left-wing Democrats.
[24:18.000 --> 24:23.000]  It was also crazy left-wing Democrats who were for the lockdown across America.
[24:23.000 --> 24:32.000]  I know you're more of a libertarian senator, but the weed industry and the effect on our children is undeniable.
[24:32.000 --> 24:41.000]  Psychosis and schizophrenia directly related to consistent and persistent high THC marijuana use by young people.
[24:41.000 --> 24:47.000]  It is exploding in Colorado and California and Connecticut and New Hampshire.
[24:47.000 --> 24:51.000]  What of that? How does this play into it?
[24:51.000 --> 24:57.000]  Well, I want to be clear that I'm not an advocate for using marijuana, particularly not an advocate for children to use it.
[24:57.000 --> 25:04.000]  I agree with you that it's more potent than it used to be and that I think there are some psychiatric disorders associated with it.
[25:04.000 --> 25:11.000]  You have to remember there also that schizophrenia begins about 18 to 21, so some of these may be unrelated to the drug use.
[25:11.000 --> 25:13.000]  But I'm not an advocate for the drug use.
[25:13.000 --> 25:15.000]  Let's stop right there. Absolutely.
[25:15.000 --> 25:21.000]  I have been for decriminalization of marijuana for 25, 30 years since I've been in public.
[25:21.000 --> 25:32.000]  But if you remember back during my divorce trial and custody battle now, seven years ago, six years ago, it was national headlines.
[25:32.000 --> 25:36.000]  In a deposition, they said, do you smoke marijuana?
[25:36.000 --> 25:38.000]  And I said, very rarely.
[25:38.000 --> 25:40.000]  It's so weaponized now.
[25:40.000 --> 25:43.000]  George Soros funded some groups to make it so strong.
[25:43.000 --> 25:45.000]  It's a hundred times stronger.
[25:45.000 --> 25:51.000]  And since George Soros weaponized the marijuana, I might smoke it once a year just to see how powerful it is.
[25:51.000 --> 25:54.000]  And the media all made a big national joke about that.
[25:54.000 --> 26:00.000]  But I was reading the studies of the different national groups, international groups he'd funded.
[26:00.000 --> 26:05.000]  And now they admit that it's caused an explosion in psychiatric problems.
[26:05.000 --> 26:11.000]  Yes, if you already had proclivity to be schizophrenic or to have delusions or psychosis,
[26:11.000 --> 26:19.000]  I personally know five people in my life, two of them that worked here,
[26:19.000 --> 26:27.000]  who literally went insane from smoking weaponized marijuana.
[26:27.000 --> 26:32.000]  And I remember one of them literally, literally was having delusions.
[26:32.000 --> 26:35.000]  And I'd known this person for many years before and they weren't like that.
[26:35.000 --> 26:38.000]  And I said one night, I said, let me smoke some of that pot.
[26:38.000 --> 26:40.000]  I know you've been smoking on the parking lot.
[26:40.000 --> 26:45.000]  I took two hits of it and couldn't get out of a chair for three hours.
[26:45.000 --> 26:50.000]  Blasted off my butt.
[26:50.000 --> 26:53.000]  Now, it's another different strains that's different and all the rest of it.
[26:53.000 --> 26:55.000]  And look, marijuana is an amazing plant.
[26:55.000 --> 26:56.000]  God gave it to us.
[26:56.000 --> 27:00.000]  If you take the THC out, all these different cannabinoids it's got in it,
[27:00.000 --> 27:04.000]  and all these different oils are just CBDs are incredible.
[27:04.000 --> 27:06.000]  You know, even George Straits promote those these days.
[27:06.000 --> 27:09.000]  I mean, they work for pain, you name it.
[27:09.000 --> 27:12.000]  But young people particularly need to know,
[27:12.000 --> 27:15.000]  just like the transgenderism and the fentanyl and all of it,
[27:15.000 --> 27:18.000]  weaponized marijuana is being pushed on you.
[27:18.000 --> 27:20.000]  And all these different derivatives, synthetic ones,
[27:20.000 --> 27:26.000]  that is causing massive paranoia and schizophrenic type effects.
[27:26.000 --> 27:32.000]  And I know five people that had their lives ruined by it,
[27:32.000 --> 27:37.000]  absolutely ruined by it, who were good people.
[27:37.000 --> 27:39.000]  And I'm not going to tell any stories.
[27:39.000 --> 27:43.000]  It's private, but it's very, very painful.
[27:43.000 --> 27:50.000]  And I know you've seen it yourselves and friends and family and people in your community.
[27:50.000 --> 27:54.000]  So we shouldn't lock people up in jail for smoking,
[27:54.000 --> 27:56.000]  weaponized marijuana.
[27:56.000 --> 28:01.000]  But as a culture, people should put pressure on the developers
[28:01.000 --> 28:04.000]  and those that are engineering it to make it so strong.
[28:04.000 --> 28:10.000]  And the public should really understand that just like you don't go out and buy Everclear
[28:10.000 --> 28:12.000]  when you're going to have a wedding, you go out and buy champagne.
[28:12.000 --> 28:14.000]  If you bought Everclear and put it in the punch,
[28:14.000 --> 28:17.000]  people might die of alcohol poisoning because they can't taste it.
[28:17.000 --> 28:21.000]  They don't know how strong it is.
[28:21.000 --> 28:23.000]  And it's dangerous.
[28:23.000 --> 28:27.000]  So you know, don't buy Everclear.
[28:27.000 --> 28:29.000]  And it's the same thing.
[28:29.000 --> 28:34.000]  Regular marijuana is like a beer compared to 200% alcohol.
[28:34.000 --> 28:36.000]  That's 100%, 200-proof alcohol.
[28:36.000 --> 28:37.000]  But it's the same thing.
[28:37.000 --> 28:40.000]  There needs to be labels on these things.
[28:40.000 --> 28:43.000]  And people need to understand that it's extremely dangerous.
[28:43.000 --> 28:45.000]  It has a lot of great effects for people.
[28:45.000 --> 28:47.000]  It just depends on the person.
[28:47.000 --> 28:49.000]  A lot of high-strung people wouldn't be alive today.
[28:49.000 --> 28:50.000]  They'd be dead from heart attacks.
[28:50.000 --> 28:52.000]  It wasn't from marijuana.
[28:52.000 --> 28:54.000]  But on average, it is wrecking our youth.
[28:54.000 --> 28:56.000]  We'll be right back with huge news.
[28:56.000 --> 28:59.000]  Stay with us.
[29:26.000 --> 29:29.000]  And if you feel like showing us some love today

[29:56.000 --> 29:59.000]  infowarstore.com
[29:59.000 --> 30:01.000]  Until about 150 years ago,
[30:01.000 --> 30:06.000]  cultures all over the world believe that people got sick
[30:06.000 --> 30:08.000]  and died in many cases in the winter
[30:08.000 --> 30:11.000]  because of something called vapors.
[30:11.000 --> 30:15.000]  They associated these poisonous vapors with cold weather.
[30:15.000 --> 30:17.000]  Of course, it wasn't the cold weather
[30:17.000 --> 30:19.000]  or catching a chill that killed people,
[30:19.000 --> 30:23.000]  but what was killing people was a lack of vitamin D3.
[30:23.000 --> 30:26.000]  You see, the sun, via your skin,
[30:26.000 --> 30:29.000]  helps your body produce vitamin D3.
[30:29.000 --> 30:31.000]  But if you're not getting enough sun,
[30:31.000 --> 30:33.000]  you will not produce vitamin D3,
[30:33.000 --> 30:35.000]  and then it's very easy for viruses
[30:35.000 --> 30:37.000]  and other things to start replicating
[30:37.000 --> 30:38.000]  and taking your body over.
[30:38.000 --> 30:40.000]  So now it's more important than ever,
[30:40.000 --> 30:41.000]  because the winter's here,
[30:41.000 --> 30:43.000]  to take high quality vitamin D3,
[30:43.000 --> 30:46.000]  and we have the best with our vitamin D3 gummies with calcium

[30:59.000 --> 31:04.000]  It's hard to believe sometimes that we are still live on air,
[31:04.000 --> 31:06.000]  broadcasting free worldwide,
[31:06.000 --> 31:12.000]  and it seems quite real that things can change in an instant.
[31:12.000 --> 31:14.000]  Things are getting very weird,
[31:14.000 --> 31:17.000]  and it's definitely more difficult than ever
[31:17.000 --> 31:19.000]  to even know what's going on.
[31:19.000 --> 31:21.000]  But we'll keep doing our best

[31:59.000 --> 32:02.000]  It's a post-COVID world now.
[32:02.000 --> 32:04.000]  Americans have lost trust in their doctors
[32:04.000 --> 32:06.000]  and the healthcare system.
[32:06.000 --> 32:08.000]  There's a solution. The wellness company.
[32:08.000 --> 32:09.000]  I'm Dr. Peter McCullough,
[32:09.000 --> 32:11.000]  and I'm the Chief Scientific Officer.
[32:11.000 --> 32:13.000]  And I can tell you firsthand
[32:13.000 --> 32:16.000]  that these verticals of uncensored content,
[32:16.000 --> 32:19.000]  virtual appointments, doctors on demand,
[32:19.000 --> 32:22.000]  prescriptions through a network of community pharmacies,
[32:22.000 --> 32:27.000]  in-home, in vitro diagnostics, laboratory testing, imaging,
[32:27.000 --> 32:30.000]  an online set of holistic products
[32:30.000 --> 32:33.000]  can help guide you for your usual general medical care,
[32:33.000 --> 32:38.000]  but also COVID-19, acute and post-COVID syndromes,
[32:38.000 --> 32:40.000]  vaccine injury syndromes,
[32:40.000 --> 32:44.000]  and the array of things that now America has to work through
[32:44.000 --> 32:47.000]  in this new world that we're living in.
[32:47.000 --> 32:50.000]  So go to onlinehealthnow.com
[32:50.000 --> 32:54.000]  and check out the wellness company for a low monthly fee.
[32:54.000 --> 33:23.000]  You can get started today and on a pathway to better health.
[33:23.000 --> 33:29.000]  Well, words really can't describe how good the news is
[33:29.000 --> 33:33.000]  that the general public, world leaders,
[33:33.000 --> 33:36.000]  prominent members of Congress, governors,
[33:36.000 --> 33:40.000]  the general public are awake to fouchy and the poison shots.
[33:40.000 --> 33:41.000]  That's what they try to say.
[33:41.000 --> 33:43.000]  Let's have an amnesty. Let's back down.
[33:43.000 --> 33:45.000]  China's stopped what it's doing for a while
[33:45.000 --> 33:47.000]  because they want us to all kind of forget and go back to sleep.
[33:47.000 --> 33:49.000]  It's not going to happen.
[33:49.000 --> 33:51.000]  I'm telling you, it's reached critical mass.
[33:51.000 --> 33:53.000]  They're in a lot of trouble.
[33:53.000 --> 33:56.000]  And the whole deep state is coming out from under its rocks
[33:56.000 --> 33:58.000]  to defend fouchy right now.
[33:58.000 --> 33:59.000]  So that's coming up.
[33:59.000 --> 34:03.000]  Got a lot of other really big news that is just so criminal
[34:03.000 --> 34:06.000]  and it's so key to understand what they're really building
[34:06.000 --> 34:08.000]  and how we can stop it.
[34:08.000 --> 34:12.000]  Did you know colleges in California,
[34:12.000 --> 34:15.000]  Michigan and New York alone,
[34:15.000 --> 34:17.000]  that's happening in other places as well,
[34:17.000 --> 34:22.000]  are forcibly, racially and religiously
[34:22.000 --> 34:27.000]  and sexually segregating students with ID badges
[34:27.000 --> 34:30.000]  and QR codes and not letting white students
[34:30.000 --> 34:32.000]  have access to large areas of campus.
[34:32.000 --> 34:35.000]  Now, think about that before I get to it
[34:35.000 --> 34:37.000]  and let's connect the dots and all of this,
[34:37.000 --> 34:40.000]  but just think about what I just said.
[34:40.000 --> 34:43.000]  Now I'm going to show you mainstream news reporting it
[34:43.000 --> 34:45.000]  like it's a good idea.
[34:45.000 --> 34:47.000]  Currently happening.
[34:47.000 --> 34:51.000]  And oh, we're going to ban not just gas cars, but all cars.
[34:51.000 --> 34:55.000]  And oh, we're going to all of it ties together.
[34:55.000 --> 34:57.000]  We're going to get to it in just a moment,
[34:57.000 --> 34:59.000]  but it's the sabotage of society at every level
[34:59.000 --> 35:04.000]  in classical tyranny with a high-tech facelift being brought in.
[35:04.000 --> 35:07.000]  Everything tyrants have done before,
[35:07.000 --> 35:11.000]  they're now bringing forward 2.0.
[35:11.000 --> 35:13.000]  But let me make a huge announcement right now
[35:13.000 --> 35:17.000]  that is so exciting on so many fronts.
[35:17.000 --> 35:24.000]  Nietzsche, the German philosopher famously said,
[35:24.000 --> 35:30.000]  that which does not kill you only makes you stronger.
[35:30.000 --> 35:32.000]  And it's true.
[35:32.000 --> 35:34.000]  If you know you're under attack and you don't submit
[35:34.000 --> 35:36.000]  and you innovate and resist, you get stronger.
[35:36.000 --> 35:38.000]  It's like lifting weights, your muscles get bigger.
[35:38.000 --> 35:41.000]  Or studying science and mathematics and literature,
[35:41.000 --> 35:44.000]  your skills get better and your brain makes more connections.
[35:44.000 --> 35:46.000]  And you put your mind through a lot of stress,
[35:46.000 --> 35:48.000]  it becomes more powerful.
[35:48.000 --> 35:52.000]  So in the last two years, it wasn't just supply chain breakdowns
[35:52.000 --> 35:57.000]  that caused us to not be able to get a lot of our high-quality products in.
[35:57.000 --> 36:00.000]  We were shooting for California standards that are almost unattainable
[36:00.000 --> 36:02.000]  for the cleanable that's available.
[36:02.000 --> 36:05.000]  Almost all our supplements passed California standards.
[36:05.000 --> 36:07.000]  Almost no one else's do.
[36:07.000 --> 36:09.000]  That was part of the issue.
[36:09.000 --> 36:12.000]  And the other issue was during the lockdowns,
[36:12.000 --> 36:16.000]  we had six different suppliers for our supplements.
[36:16.000 --> 36:18.000]  Four of them got bought out by companies
[36:18.000 --> 36:21.000]  and two of the biggest suppliers we later learned
[36:21.000 --> 36:24.000]  got bought out by leftist corporations
[36:24.000 --> 36:27.000]  that would not ship us our product or mess with us
[36:27.000 --> 36:30.000]  and just do all sorts of weird stuff to us.
[36:30.000 --> 36:34.000]  And we later found out with one big company in particular
[36:34.000 --> 36:38.000]  they just said, we don't want your business.
[36:38.000 --> 36:41.000]  But in that process,
[36:41.000 --> 36:43.000]  I sent some of my crew around the country
[36:43.000 --> 36:46.000]  to meet with top developers, top companies.
[36:46.000 --> 36:48.000]  Got a lot of doors slamming our faces.
[36:48.000 --> 36:50.000]  But by the grace of God,
[36:50.000 --> 36:53.000]  we didn't just find one, we found two
[36:53.000 --> 36:56.000]  who are right in the top five,
[36:56.000 --> 36:59.000]  not just national but international producers
[36:59.000 --> 37:00.000]  of high-end supplements.
[37:00.000 --> 37:02.000]  In fact, one of the companies
[37:02.000 --> 37:05.000]  is a medium-sized pharmaceutical company.
[37:05.000 --> 37:07.000]  I'm talking $10 million in sales a year.
[37:07.000 --> 37:09.000]  I mean household-named products,
[37:09.000 --> 37:12.000]  both prescription and over-the-counter.
[37:12.000 --> 37:14.000]  That supplies Walgreens,
[37:14.000 --> 37:16.000]  you name it, with their main products.
[37:16.000 --> 37:17.000]  I'm going to leave it at that.
[37:17.000 --> 37:23.000]  Turns out the gentleman is a listener.
[37:23.000 --> 37:25.000]  Then, as soon as we had that deal,
[37:25.000 --> 37:27.000]  over a year ago, but it took much time to get it cranked up
[37:27.000 --> 37:29.000]  and to get the funds in to buy the products,
[37:29.000 --> 37:32.000]  we got another person,
[37:32.000 --> 37:34.000]  another group in the top five
[37:34.000 --> 37:37.000]  who also don't like what's happening to us.
[37:37.000 --> 37:40.000]  So it turned out almost all the big supplement makers
[37:40.000 --> 37:42.000]  we were using were buying their products
[37:42.000 --> 37:46.000]  from these two companies.
[37:46.000 --> 37:48.000]  So that means in the future,
[37:48.000 --> 37:50.000]  we're going to be able to lower the prices
[37:50.000 --> 37:54.000]  on InfoWars Live products.
[37:54.000 --> 37:57.000]  But it also means we're going to be able to roll out
[37:57.000 --> 38:00.000]  new product lines that are clones
[38:00.000 --> 38:02.000]  of best-selling products that these companies
[38:02.000 --> 38:05.000]  already put out.
[38:05.000 --> 38:08.000]  And that means most of these are sold in stores
[38:08.000 --> 38:10.000]  under the high-end names.
[38:10.000 --> 38:12.000]  A lot of you know.
[38:12.000 --> 38:14.000]  We're going to be able to have them,
[38:14.000 --> 38:16.000]  but by not being put in the store,
[38:16.000 --> 38:18.000]  cut the price massively,
[38:18.000 --> 38:21.000]  and not ship out of our facility,
[38:21.000 --> 38:23.000]  but ship out of their facilities,
[38:23.000 --> 38:25.000]  so they're not having to ship it to us,
[38:25.000 --> 38:28.000]  and then we ship it to you, that cuts prices more.
[38:28.000 --> 38:31.000]  So all these attacks only made us stronger.
[38:31.000 --> 38:33.000]  Well, glory goes to God.
[38:33.000 --> 38:35.000]  Thank you, everybody, for your prayers.
[38:35.000 --> 38:38.000]  So finally,
[38:38.000 --> 38:41.000]  finally, we got the first 10 products in,
[38:41.000 --> 38:43.000]  made right here in America,
[38:43.000 --> 38:45.000]  and here's an example.
[38:45.000 --> 38:48.000]  Tumoric 95 is the same 95%
[38:48.000 --> 38:50.000]  of humanoid in bodies,
[38:50.000 --> 38:53.000]  and we were buying the strongest tumoric.
[38:53.000 --> 38:55.000]  We asked a big company,
[38:55.000 --> 38:57.000]  they said, well, this is the best,
[38:57.000 --> 38:59.000]  but it's expensive.
[38:59.000 --> 39:01.000]  95%
[39:01.000 --> 39:03.000]  the tumoric and its 95%
[39:03.000 --> 39:05.000]  is extract strongest out there.
[39:05.000 --> 39:07.000]  Well, we now have Tumoric 95.
[39:07.000 --> 39:09.000]  We'll still have bodies, folks like the name,
[39:09.000 --> 39:11.000]  but it's to be made by these folks anyways.
[39:11.000 --> 39:13.000]  But Tumoric 95
[39:13.000 --> 39:15.000]  is basically the same formula,
[39:15.000 --> 39:17.000]  but a little bit better.
[39:17.000 --> 39:19.000]  Boom!
[39:19.000 --> 39:21.000]  InfoWars MD.
[39:21.000 --> 39:23.000]  And the first run is a limited supply,
[39:23.000 --> 39:25.000]  but it's there.
[39:25.000 --> 39:27.000]  LabitoRX is the Rolls Royce
[39:27.000 --> 39:29.000]  that have known healthy compounds
[39:29.000 --> 39:31.000]  to supercharge not just your labito,
[39:31.000 --> 39:33.000]  but your stamina and just your well-being,
[39:33.000 --> 39:35.000]  and it's amazing what it does
[39:35.000 --> 39:37.000]  for men and women.
[39:37.000 --> 39:39.000]  LabitoRX.
[39:39.000 --> 39:41.000]  This green formula,
[39:41.000 --> 39:43.000]  Superfood Greens,
[39:43.000 --> 39:45.000]  is a nationally known product
[39:45.000 --> 39:47.000]  that we're able to give to you
[39:47.000 --> 39:49.000]  at 25% to 50% off,
[39:49.000 --> 39:51.000]  depending on what cells they have going.
[39:51.000 --> 39:53.000]  Sometimes on store shelves,
[39:53.000 --> 39:55.000]  we're only giving you 25% discount,
[39:55.000 --> 39:57.000]  it's 50% discount.
[39:57.000 --> 39:59.000]  We have that, so good for your whole body.
[39:59.000 --> 40:01.000]  We have Ageless
[40:01.000 --> 40:03.000]  Vitality Pure Collagen,
[40:03.000 --> 40:05.000]  super high-end, massively discounted.
[40:05.000 --> 40:07.000]  We have a
[40:07.000 --> 40:09.000]  extract brain booster
[40:09.000 --> 40:11.000]  of known rare
[40:11.000 --> 40:13.000]  mushrooms, like lion's mane
[40:13.000 --> 40:15.000]  and others, that supercharges
[40:15.000 --> 40:17.000]  your mental clarity
[40:17.000 --> 40:19.000]  and focus.
[40:19.000 --> 40:21.000]  There's a lot of leading brands
[40:21.000 --> 40:23.000]  out there that aren't even half as strong
[40:23.000 --> 40:25.000]  that cost twice as much.
[40:25.000 --> 40:27.000]  Mushroom Max.
[40:29.000 --> 40:31.000]  This is a game-changer.
[40:31.000 --> 40:33.000]  It'll get you great products at lower prices.
[40:33.000 --> 40:35.000]  It'll fund your operation right in time
[40:35.000 --> 40:37.000]  for you to do your Christmas shopping.
[40:37.000 --> 40:39.000]  It's all available
[40:39.000 --> 40:41.000]  at InfowarsStore.com
[40:41.000 --> 40:43.000]  under InfowarsMD.
[40:43.000 --> 40:45.000]  Tumor 95,
[40:45.000 --> 40:47.000]  LabitoRX, Better Mood Plus,
[40:47.000 --> 40:49.000]  Nitric Boost, super strong to boost
[40:49.000 --> 40:51.000]  nitrous oxide in your blood.
[40:51.000 --> 40:53.000]  Mushroom Max, Ageless Vitality Collagen,
[40:53.000 --> 40:55.000]  superfood greens, and
[40:55.000 --> 40:57.000]  three
[40:57.000 --> 40:59.000]  full-spectrum CBDs
[40:59.000 --> 41:01.000]  that do incredible things for your joints, your brain,
[41:01.000 --> 41:03.000]  your body, inflammation.
[41:03.000 --> 41:05.000]  No THC.
[41:05.000 --> 41:07.000]  Doesn't get you high, but does incredible
[41:07.000 --> 41:09.000]  things for your whole body. This is a top-of-the-line
[41:09.000 --> 41:11.000]  concentrate.
[41:11.000 --> 41:13.000]  They have a
[41:13.000 --> 41:15.000]  1,000 milligram one.
[41:15.000 --> 41:17.000]  Be very careful with this. I'll take a few drops.
[41:17.000 --> 41:19.000]  That normally sells in stores
[41:19.000 --> 41:21.000]  for $150.
[41:21.000 --> 41:23.000]  Retailing for $89.
[41:23.000 --> 41:25.000]  And we're already discounting it
[41:25.000 --> 41:27.000]  for $67.
[41:27.000 --> 41:29.000]  Nobody's going to sell you
[41:29.000 --> 41:31.000]  1,000 milligram CBD
[41:31.000 --> 41:33.000]  for that. That is
[41:33.000 --> 41:35.000]  insane. Now, it will sell out.
[41:35.000 --> 41:37.000]  By the way, that's the one product of their line
[41:37.000 --> 41:39.000]  that they're almost sold out of. They're not going to be able to produce
[41:39.000 --> 41:41.000]  more until January. We have
[41:41.000 --> 41:43.000]  the 10 milligram and the 25 milligram.
[41:43.000 --> 41:45.000]  I would suggest you take
[41:45.000 --> 41:47.000]  the CBD full-spectrum
[41:47.000 --> 41:49.000]  10 milligram and 20 milligram
[41:49.000 --> 41:51.000]  before you mess with the
[41:51.000 --> 41:53.000]  1,000 milligram.
[41:53.000 --> 41:55.000]  This is all extremely real.
[41:55.000 --> 41:57.000]  Consult your physician or health care provider
[41:57.000 --> 41:59.000]  before you take any of it.
[41:59.000 --> 42:01.000]  So those are the first
[42:01.000 --> 42:03.000]  10 products
[42:03.000 --> 42:05.000]  from InfowarsMD
[42:05.000 --> 42:07.000]  at InfowarsStore.com
[42:07.000 --> 42:09.000]  And then
[42:09.000 --> 42:11.000]  we're announcing another line
[42:11.000 --> 42:13.000]  made by the other big national manufacturer
[42:13.000 --> 42:15.000]  who is letting us clone
[42:15.000 --> 42:17.000]  their best-selling product line.
[42:17.000 --> 42:19.000]  They've got more than 50 top-selling
[42:19.000 --> 42:21.000]  supplements. 11 of them are
[42:21.000 --> 42:23.000]  number one in the country. Household names
[42:23.000 --> 42:25.000]  people that know them.
[42:25.000 --> 42:27.000]  We have now been able to clone 2 of them
[42:27.000 --> 42:29.000]  as the exact same product with our label
[42:29.000 --> 42:31.000]  for at least 25
[42:31.000 --> 42:33.000]  to 50% off
[42:33.000 --> 42:35.000]  what they're sold in stores. The first
[42:35.000 --> 42:37.000]  who are now out under Infowars Platinum
[42:37.000 --> 42:39.000]  available at InfowarsStore.com
[42:39.000 --> 42:41.000]  1776
[42:41.000 --> 42:43.000]  Testosterone Boost
[42:43.000 --> 42:45.000]  and PainMD
[42:45.000 --> 42:47.000]  Both of these are already leading
[42:47.000 --> 42:49.000]  national best sellers under another name.
[42:49.000 --> 42:51.000]  We bring them to you with our label
[42:51.000 --> 42:53.000]  massively discounted and it funds
[42:53.000 --> 42:55.000]  the Infowar a 360 win.
[42:55.000 --> 42:57.000]  InfowarsMD and Infowars Platinum

[43:57.000 --> 43:59.000]  at InfowarsStore.com today.
[44:01.000 --> 44:03.000]  I have been in a 28 year
[44:03.000 --> 44:05.000]  marathon battle with the Globals
[44:05.000 --> 44:07.000]  I have come from
[44:07.000 --> 44:09.000]  nowhere to the very
[44:09.000 --> 44:11.000]  heights of politics, not just in America
[44:11.000 --> 44:13.000]  but in the world.
[44:13.000 --> 44:15.000]  We are engaging the Globals
[44:15.000 --> 44:17.000]  at point blank range in the information war
[44:17.000 --> 44:19.000]  but I don't deserve the credit.
[44:19.000 --> 44:21.000]  Yes, I've persevered
[44:21.000 --> 44:23.000]  but the listeners and viewers
[44:23.000 --> 44:25.000]  who support Infowars for the real reason
[44:25.000 --> 44:27.000]  we've had the success.
[44:27.000 --> 44:29.000]  We're having now the greatest victories
[44:29.000 --> 44:31.000]  in the fight against the new order
[44:31.000 --> 44:33.000]  we've ever had. We are now
[44:33.000 --> 44:35.000]  entering the final mile
[44:35.000 --> 44:37.000]  of the marathon and that's why
[44:37.000 --> 44:39.000]  today it's more important than ever
[44:39.000 --> 44:41.000]  to realize how important you've been in this fight
[44:41.000 --> 44:43.000]  and to continue in the efforts
[44:43.000 --> 44:45.000]  you've been carrying out and to intensify them.
[44:45.000 --> 44:47.000]  God bless you all.
[44:47.000 --> 44:49.000]  I salute you. I thank you
[44:49.000 --> 44:51.000]  and I beg you to intensify what you're doing
[44:51.000 --> 44:53.000]  now because we are over the target
[44:53.000 --> 44:55.000]  and history is happening.
[44:55.000 --> 44:57.000]  The fight is my fight. It's your fight.
[44:57.000 --> 44:59.000]  It's our fight. God bless you all.
[44:59.000 --> 45:01.000]  In Arizona I think we watched
[45:01.000 --> 45:03.000]  the election be
[45:03.000 --> 45:05.000]  slowly stolen, slowly stolen
[45:05.000 --> 45:07.000]  day by day counting these mail-in
[45:07.000 --> 45:09.000]  ballots and it's
[45:09.000 --> 45:11.000]  absolutely absurd for anyone
[45:11.000 --> 45:13.000]  to take our election seriously
[45:13.000 --> 45:15.000]  when we just
[45:15.000 --> 45:17.000]  it's election month Alex. It's not election day
[45:17.000 --> 45:19.000]  and that's the problem
[45:19.000 --> 45:21.000]  and everything changed
[45:21.000 --> 45:23.000]  after COVID-19. They
[45:23.000 --> 45:25.000]  illegally changed state elections
[45:25.000 --> 45:27.000]  mailing ballots
[45:27.000 --> 45:29.000]  to anyone and everyone
[45:29.000 --> 45:31.000]  and sometimes mailing multiple ballots
[45:31.000 --> 45:33.000]  to people. Well, this isn't any way
[45:33.000 --> 45:35.000]  to run an election. We're in a serious
[45:35.000 --> 45:37.000]  country when we have elections
[45:37.000 --> 45:39.000]  that can be stolen like this
[45:39.000 --> 45:41.000]  and I believe that just like I believe
[45:41.000 --> 45:43.000]  the election was stolen in 2020
[45:43.000 --> 45:45.000]  and I have no problem saying that
[45:45.000 --> 45:47.000]  and it is so absurd for the media
[45:47.000 --> 45:49.000]  and the Democrats to attack us
[45:49.000 --> 45:51.000]  that question our election integrity
[45:51.000 --> 45:53.000]  and question the fact that elections
[45:53.000 --> 45:55.000]  shouldn't be run the way
[45:55.000 --> 45:57.000]  they are. We're not election
[45:57.000 --> 45:59.000]  deniers. We're election realists.
[45:59.000 --> 46:01.000]  It's hard to believe sometimes
[46:01.000 --> 46:03.000]  that we are still
[46:03.000 --> 46:05.000]  live on air broadcasting
[46:05.000 --> 46:07.000]  free worldwide
[46:07.000 --> 46:09.000]  and it seems quite real that
[46:09.000 --> 46:11.000]  things can change in an instant.
[46:11.000 --> 46:13.000]  Things are getting
[46:13.000 --> 46:15.000]  very weird and it's
[46:15.000 --> 46:17.000]  definitely more difficult than ever
[46:17.000 --> 46:19.000]  to even know what's going on
[46:19.000 --> 46:21.000]  but we'll keep doing our best
[46:21.000 --> 46:23.000]  so long as you keep us on the air
[46:23.000 --> 46:25.000]  and you could do that now
[46:25.000 --> 46:27.000]  at infowarstore.com
[46:27.000 --> 46:29.000]  Help us clear out our stock
[46:29.000 --> 46:31.000]  of bodies to work
[46:31.000 --> 46:33.000]  Vitamin C with zinc and alpha
[46:33.000 --> 46:35.000]  power. Turn those shady
[46:35.000 --> 46:37.000]  Federal Reserve notes into the
[46:37.000 --> 46:39.000]  highest quality supplements available
[46:39.000 --> 46:41.000]  while they still last.
[46:41.000 --> 46:43.000]  Now with free shipping
[46:43.000 --> 46:45.000]  we thank you
[46:45.000 --> 46:47.000]  for your support
[46:47.000 --> 46:49.000]  and we wish you a very peaceful,
[46:49.000 --> 47:01.000]  happy and merry Christmas.
[47:01.000 --> 47:03.000]  Leading a frontal assault
[47:03.000 --> 47:05.000]  on the lies of the New World Order
[47:05.000 --> 47:21.000]  it's Alex Jones.
[47:21.000 --> 47:37.000]  You can see it. You can face it.
[47:37.000 --> 47:39.000]  Everything the left is doing
[47:39.000 --> 47:41.000]  worldwide is funded
[47:41.000 --> 47:43.000]  by the most powerful
[47:43.000 --> 47:45.000]  money laundering
[47:45.000 --> 47:47.000]  central banks that control criminal
[47:47.000 --> 47:49.000]  organizations like
[47:49.000 --> 47:51.000]  FTX
[47:51.000 --> 47:53.000]  right down to the grassroots
[47:53.000 --> 47:57.000]  organizations like MS-13.
[47:57.000 --> 47:59.000]  And everything they're doing is to destabilize
[47:59.000 --> 48:01.000]  and bring down civilization
[48:01.000 --> 48:03.000]  in their own words and make you give up
[48:03.000 --> 48:05.000]  and go bankrupt to put you on
[48:05.000 --> 48:07.000]  a universal basic income
[48:07.000 --> 48:09.000]  so you will then have to culturally
[48:09.000 --> 48:11.000]  do what they tell you to
[48:11.000 --> 48:13.000]  including at some point
[48:13.000 --> 48:15.000]  agree to be euthanized
[48:15.000 --> 48:17.000]  or you will not get funds.
[48:17.000 --> 48:19.000]  I've been telling you this for a decade
[48:19.000 --> 48:21.000]  that they would start saying, particularly in Europe and Canada
[48:21.000 --> 48:23.000]  as the beta test
[48:23.000 --> 48:25.000]  you can live for two more years
[48:25.000 --> 48:27.000]  and we'll pay for your healthcare and pay for your free house
[48:27.000 --> 48:29.000]  and pay for vacations and let you have some fun
[48:29.000 --> 48:31.000]  but to save the taxpayers money
[48:31.000 --> 48:33.000]  we're going to then need you
[48:33.000 --> 48:35.000]  to sign up to be euthanized in two years
[48:35.000 --> 48:37.000]  and people are already doing that in Canada.
[48:39.000 --> 48:41.000]  And just like we predicted they take them to the beach
[48:41.000 --> 48:43.000]  they take them on trips, they glorify them
[48:43.000 --> 48:45.000]  they tell them how smart they are
[48:45.000 --> 48:47.000]  just like they do little kids
[48:47.000 --> 48:49.000]  who they get to sign up to have their genitals cut off.
[48:51.000 --> 48:53.000]  Imagine if somebody wrote a novel
[48:53.000 --> 48:55.000]  a science fiction dystopic novel 30 years ago
[48:55.000 --> 48:57.000]  about the things that are happening now
[48:57.000 --> 48:59.000]  you'd read that novel and you'd say that'll never happen
[49:01.000 --> 49:03.000]  but it is happening.
[49:03.000 --> 49:05.000]  So now in public universities
[49:05.000 --> 49:07.000]  across Europe and the United States
[49:07.000 --> 49:09.000]  you hear about these days
[49:09.000 --> 49:11.000]  hell even happened in Kansas a few years ago
[49:11.000 --> 49:13.000]  and Missouri of all places in the Midwest
[49:13.000 --> 49:15.000]  where the teachers walk up
[49:15.000 --> 49:17.000]  and say the whole campus
[49:17.000 --> 49:19.000]  no whites allowed for the weekend
[49:21.000 --> 49:23.000]  and then the Asian guy
[49:23.000 --> 49:25.000]  and the white guy say to the white woman
[49:27.000 --> 49:29.000]  I guess that was in Missouri that case famously
[49:29.000 --> 49:31.000]  well you're white too, she goes that's different
[49:31.000 --> 49:33.000]  I'm part of the faculty
[49:33.000 --> 49:35.000]  and then she goes get me some muscle
[49:35.000 --> 49:37.000]  over here to stop them
[49:39.000 --> 49:41.000]  that guy search engine that
[49:41.000 --> 49:43.000]  was on YouTube
[49:45.000 --> 49:47.000]  professor says get me some muscle
[49:47.000 --> 49:49.000]  to throw whites off campus
[49:49.000 --> 49:51.000]  get me some muscle over here
[49:51.000 --> 49:53.000]  and then you see Evergreen College
[49:53.000 --> 49:55.000]  on the west coast
[49:55.000 --> 49:57.000]  a few years ago said yeah
[49:57.000 --> 49:59.000]  whole areas of the school whites aren't allowed to go on it
[50:01.000 --> 50:03.000]  so why would they want to artificially
[50:03.000 --> 50:05.000]  segregate people to control them
[50:05.000 --> 50:07.000]  to brainwash them to turn them against each other
[50:07.000 --> 50:09.000]  just like a prison
[50:09.000 --> 50:11.000]  we'll have a warden that will encourage
[50:11.000 --> 50:13.000]  a white supremacist group, a black supremacist group
[50:13.000 --> 50:15.000]  an Hispanic supremacist group
[50:15.000 --> 50:17.000]  and then everybody is
[50:17.000 --> 50:19.000]  housed
[50:19.000 --> 50:21.000]  in those
[50:21.000 --> 50:23.000]  areas
[50:23.000 --> 50:25.000]  and then they use the gang leaders
[50:25.000 --> 50:27.000]  that are racially based
[50:27.000 --> 50:29.000]  to control them great job crew
[50:29.000 --> 50:31.000]  they actually found an article about it put it back on screen
[50:31.000 --> 50:33.000]  Missouri professor recalled
[50:33.000 --> 50:35.000]  for some muscle that a protest
[50:35.000 --> 50:37.000]  is charged
[50:37.000 --> 50:39.000]  they actually physically assaulted people
[50:39.000 --> 50:41.000]  so back then
[50:41.000 --> 50:43.000]  that was
[50:43.000 --> 50:45.000]  2016
[50:45.000 --> 50:47.000]  that was six years ago
[50:47.000 --> 50:49.000]  back then
[50:49.000 --> 50:51.000]  you weren't allowed to do that
[50:53.000 --> 50:55.000]  but now they've got some special muscle
[50:55.000 --> 50:57.000]  because you're used to the QR codes for menus
[50:57.000 --> 50:59.000]  QR codes to get on campus
[50:59.000 --> 51:01.000]  QR codes to leave
[51:01.000 --> 51:03.000]  a lot of campuses said you can't leave for the semester
[51:03.000 --> 51:05.000]  or you'll be expelled because of COVID
[51:05.000 --> 51:07.000]  so what about psychological warfare
[51:07.000 --> 51:09.000]  a giant Milgram experiment
[51:09.000 --> 51:11.000]  or a Stanford prison experiment
[51:11.000 --> 51:13.000]  to see what they can get you to put up with
[51:13.000 --> 51:15.000]  if you're a new listener
[51:15.000 --> 51:17.000]  write down things I say
[51:17.000 --> 51:19.000]  don't just say things to sound smart
[51:19.000 --> 51:21.000]  look up the Milgram psychological experiment
[51:21.000 --> 51:23.000]  look up the Stanford prison experiment
[51:23.000 --> 51:25.000]  then you'll know what I'm talking about
[51:25.000 --> 51:27.000]  we're not just saying things here
[51:27.000 --> 51:29.000]  these mean things
[51:29.000 --> 51:31.000]  for new listeners
[51:31.000 --> 51:33.000]  so now all over the world
[51:33.000 --> 51:39.580]  You're going to have to have a tracking system on your phone and a badge to be on campus
[51:39.580 --> 51:44.600]  and whites aren't allowed to go certain places because you're inherently bad and groups that
[51:44.600 --> 51:51.260]  say they're LGBTQP or groups that say they're black, they will then get their own area and
[51:51.260 --> 51:55.900]  they're encouraged to be racial, they're encouraged to be sexist, they're encouraged not to like
[51:55.900 --> 51:59.180]  straight people, they're encouraged to discriminate.
[51:59.180 --> 52:04.320]  Here's just one example, California College approves electronic security system to ban
[52:04.320 --> 52:12.620]  white males from non-white safe spaces and it goes on to say, to access the lounge, an
[52:12.620 --> 52:19.140]  ID is required in order to attain one, each student must complete a form which request
[52:19.140 --> 52:23.300]  his or her identity group, so now they're making you like Jews having to wear symbols
[52:23.300 --> 52:26.860]  and others having to wear symbols in Nazi Germany, now you've got to do it.
[52:26.860 --> 52:35.340]  The security system was approved by the administration last month, Claremount SOCA announced a much
[52:35.340 --> 52:40.980]  on Instagram and it goes through announcing you must have the badge or the QR code to
[52:40.980 --> 52:52.500]  be able to go into any of these areas and they use the excuse of being nice to minorities
[52:52.500 --> 52:57.340]  to make them feel safe by making you mark yourself as a bad person when white males
[52:57.340 --> 53:03.740]  are the minority, they're now being signaled out for discrimination, think of the magnitude,
[53:03.740 --> 53:08.540]  meanwhile there's countless videos out there on Instagram and everywhere else of seriously
[53:08.540 --> 53:14.580]  obese people saying I'm fat, I love it, you're not going to stop me, we're the best and look
[53:14.580 --> 53:18.580]  I don't dislike these people because they're so obese, the point is that there is a celebration
[53:18.580 --> 53:22.860]  of it and the system in corporate America celebrating it, not trying to help people
[53:22.860 --> 53:29.540]  eating their poison GMO, but making them think it's cool that their life expectancy is going
[53:29.540 --> 53:59.500]  to be cut by 50-60%, let's roll just one of these videos.
[53:59.500 --> 54:22.880]  So let's continue, if you criticize that on these platforms you're kicked off, World
[54:22.880 --> 54:28.420]  Economic Forum WF is now calling for an end to private car ownership, I'm going to come
[54:28.420 --> 54:32.140]  back next hour and play that but I wanted to go to some of these other articles, a generation
[54:32.140 --> 54:36.500]  of no car ownership is around the corner, Dutch government attempts to forcefully close
[54:36.500 --> 54:41.460]  3,000 farms saying plants and animals are bad because they're carbon, see how insane
[54:41.460 --> 54:47.100]  that is, with the green agenda, rebel farmers are pushing back on climate action, this is
[54:47.100 --> 54:53.820]  why, Yahoo News, good news though, Vanguard quits climate alliance in blow to net zero
[54:53.820 --> 54:59.060]  project, financial times of London, people are seeing through it, the agenda is a fraud,
[54:59.060 --> 55:04.220]  it's falling apart, it's about cutting off resources to control people, you know, I've
[55:04.220 --> 55:11.060]  seen different graphics out there, I forgot to show it on air, but it shows Karl Marx
[55:11.060 --> 55:18.860]  at the middle and then around it these bubbles and at 12 o'clock it says communism is a utopia
[55:18.860 --> 55:24.820]  and then it just goes around where you put in communism, restrict, take over the land,
[55:24.820 --> 55:30.820]  people start starving to death, there's mass tyranny, death camps and then they say, well,
[55:30.820 --> 55:36.260]  we didn't really implement communism right, let's do it again, it's a utopia and it's
[55:36.260 --> 55:42.860]  that cycle over and over and over again with ultra rich elites controlling it because they
[55:42.860 --> 55:48.700]  don't want competition, they want to centralize control, here's another example, beyond
[55:48.700 --> 55:54.380]  meat is struggling and the plant-based meat industry worries, 80 plus percent plunge
[55:54.380 --> 56:00.820]  in their stocks, 83 percent, everything falling apart, no one eating it, people discovering
[56:00.820 --> 56:07.260]  that it's really, really toxic and full of estrogen that make people super unhealthy,
[56:07.260 --> 56:12.460]  on and on and on, they've weaponized everything and the minute we figure that out and become
[56:12.460 --> 56:18.460]  aware of it and start saying no, instead of submitting, we start pushing back and that
[56:18.460 --> 56:24.860]  makes us stronger and makes them weaker, it's an animating contest, get in the fight and
[56:24.860 --> 56:29.780]  you'll feel alive again, stop submitting, you're unhappy and depressed because your
[56:29.780 --> 56:37.620]  subconscious mind knows you're not doing what you should be doing, so pray to God, go to
[56:37.620 --> 56:42.860]  the park, hike in the woods, exercise, all of us should do this more, eat healthier,
[56:42.860 --> 56:47.940]  none of us are perfect, it's a goal, reach out and help others, realize you're an eternal
[56:47.940 --> 56:52.340]  being made by God, realize the globalists are falling on your enemy and don't let them
[56:52.340 --> 56:57.540]  depress you, don't let them control you, decide that you are going to transcend them with
[56:57.540 --> 57:02.300]  God's help and realize that God is watching you and we live in this beautiful timeless
[57:02.300 --> 57:07.220]  incredible universe on this amazing planet with wonderment all around us and that just
[57:07.220 --> 57:12.580]  that understanding and opening that channel up to God and saying, God, I want to be purified,
[57:12.580 --> 57:17.660]  I want to be sanctified, I want to be better, I want to be stronger, we'll begin that inner
[57:17.660 --> 57:23.220]  dimensional energetic beyond the third dimension connection that will then begin to displace
[57:23.220 --> 57:29.300]  the evil and push it out and make you stronger and stronger and more happy and more successful.
[57:29.300 --> 57:33.580]  But you have to first decide you're beautiful and you're amazing and you're powerful and
[57:33.580 --> 57:37.460]  that means in a way 400 pounds, your soul is beautiful but you shouldn't celebrate the
[57:37.460 --> 57:41.500]  unhealthy things the globalists have encouraged you to do, you should recognize that and make
[57:41.500 --> 57:42.940]  the decision to pull away from it.
[57:42.940 --> 57:50.420]  We'll be right back with hour number two, please stay with us.

[58:55.860 --> 59:01.180]  allowed to basically question that event in any way that they deemed fit.
[59:01.180 --> 59:03.300]  The first amendment is unique in the world.
[59:03.300 --> 59:04.660]  That's what they want to take away.
[59:04.660 --> 59:06.100]  Their ability to speak freely.
[59:06.100 --> 59:09.180]  So they're going to go from Mike Lindell next or they're going to go for Steve Bannon
[59:09.180 --> 59:10.740]  or they're going to go for Tucker Carlson.
[59:10.740 --> 59:15.020]  I studied the globalist 30 years ago but only 28 years and I knew they were planning all
[59:15.020 --> 59:19.220]  of this and I warned the public as a modern Paul Revere but I couldn't have done it without
[59:19.220 --> 59:20.220]  your support.
[59:20.220 --> 59:24.100]  And now because we've been so successful warning the population of the planet not just America
[59:24.100 --> 59:27.780]  we're public enemy number one when it comes to globalist agenda.
[59:27.780 --> 59:31.460]  That's why it's more important than ever to realize how successful info wars has been
[59:31.460 --> 59:33.140]  because of your past support.

[59:56.980 --> 01:00:08.740]  All right this next hour is going to be jam packed with your phone calls and with a ton
[01:00:08.740 --> 01:00:13.900]  of news on the Fauci files that are about to drop and the moves to take your cars away
[01:00:13.900 --> 01:00:18.260]  shut down farming and what the world will look like if we don't stop them.
[01:00:18.260 --> 01:00:22.180]  So I'm going to open the phones up give the number out next segment specifically I like
[01:00:22.180 --> 01:00:27.220]  to hear your views on the Fauci files Elon Musk delivering so far where you think this
[01:00:27.220 --> 01:00:31.620]  is all going but first let's hear an incredibly important report that Greg Reese has put out
[01:00:31.620 --> 01:00:36.940]  dealing with this super creepy evil Canadian government euthanasia ad here it is paying
[01:00:36.940 --> 01:00:41.860]  attention you'll notice that the topic of suicide has been on the rise lately.
[01:00:41.860 --> 01:00:48.340]  Take for instance Canada's made program a macabre play on the French word me day meaning
[01:00:48.340 --> 01:00:54.700]  help me stories abound of doctors grooming the disabled into the dark program are coming
[01:00:54.700 --> 01:00:55.700]  to life.
[01:00:55.700 --> 01:00:58.700]  I rarely make big mistakes on air and it's it's it's fine.
[01:00:58.700 --> 01:01:06.180]  I'm so used to Greg Reese reports on the page that one of our other great Reese's did a
[01:01:06.180 --> 01:01:13.100]  video that I haven't seen yet and so I haven't haven't played it yet and so we're going to
[01:01:13.100 --> 01:01:17.860]  play that later in the broadcast just because I introduced that wrong I want to watch it
[01:01:17.860 --> 01:01:23.180]  now some of Eric Reese is really smart guy looks powerful but I need to be able to actually
[01:01:23.180 --> 01:01:26.660]  watch that and come back and talk more about that later I was already on the fence but
[01:01:26.660 --> 01:01:30.180]  I wanted to get that report out regardless there's a lot of other key reports we've got
[01:01:30.180 --> 01:01:36.020]  as well like sleepwalking into Armageddon what will you do when they come for you and
[01:01:36.020 --> 01:01:42.420]  so much more here today so let me do this let's go ahead and fire up the phone system
[01:01:42.420 --> 01:01:46.780]  and I want to give first time callers a chance to get on board I really ask the other callers
[01:01:46.780 --> 01:01:50.620]  to let new folks get on sometimes there's a lot of people can never get on board we'd
[01:01:50.620 --> 01:01:57.380]  love to hear from new listeners who are very special people agree if they disagree if they
[01:01:57.380 --> 01:02:02.100]  have a question a comment I would love to hear from new viewers because new viewers are
[01:02:02.100 --> 01:02:06.940]  people that a lot of times might just be just now waking up of course the most precious
[01:02:06.940 --> 01:02:13.940]  people are the long term hardcore supporters and you know who you are and so we'll also
[01:02:13.940 --> 01:02:19.340]  have a lot of days where we take calls and it's obviously a free for all but I would
[01:02:19.340 --> 01:02:26.620]  like to hear from new listeners about not as Elon Musk good or bad a broken clocks right
[01:02:26.620 --> 01:02:31.860]  twice a day but he is starting to go really fast in the right direction as you can go
[01:02:31.860 --> 01:02:35.700]  back and see him question the vaccines and say it was for him and say well is he a good
[01:02:35.700 --> 01:02:39.740]  guy or bad guy well regardless he's releasing the files on Fauci and we know from other
[01:02:39.740 --> 01:02:45.340]  documents what they are just already come out but these are specifically even more hardcore
[01:02:45.340 --> 01:02:53.420]  showing how he knowingly was in there censoring the public when he's told attorney generals
[01:02:53.420 --> 01:02:56.380]  and the federal government state attorney generals in the federal government that he
[01:02:56.380 --> 01:03:02.460]  did did no such thing so he's definitely in the perjury area and you know he's in danger
[01:03:02.460 --> 01:03:07.580]  because the deep state is coming out of the woodwork to protect him at every level so
[01:03:07.580 --> 01:03:11.380]  I do want to give the number out and I want to take your calls for first time callers
[01:03:11.380 --> 01:03:25.580]  the toll free number is 877-789-2539-877-789-2539-877-789-2539 also I didn't get to this on the Sunday
[01:03:25.580 --> 01:03:32.060]  night show because I'm really sick of talking about Sandy Hook and getting into it but AP
[01:03:32.060 --> 01:03:38.220]  even came out with a report saying I got railroaded and that it was probably going to get overturned
[01:03:38.220 --> 01:03:42.580]  because there'll be no more due process if they don't and they were interviewing lawyers
[01:03:42.580 --> 01:03:47.460]  on their prominent lawyers saying that I already know that but what does it mean that AP is
[01:03:47.460 --> 01:03:52.740]  doing that well why is Elon Musk releasing all these files there is a major war inside
[01:03:52.740 --> 01:03:57.180]  the deep state that controls corporate media and you're going to see more and more of this
[01:03:57.180 --> 01:04:02.580]  coming out as it gets exposed just because the globalists aren't all powerful they don't
[01:04:02.580 --> 01:04:06.460]  have total control so guys I know it was in yesterday's stack reprint me the article
[01:04:06.460 --> 01:04:11.260]  about that and put the video back on my list because I need to be able to get to that later
[01:04:11.260 --> 01:04:15.180]  today if we have a chance because it just shows that when I get up here and tell listeners
[01:04:15.180 --> 01:04:19.700]  we're going to stay on air we're going to win these appeals we're not going away so
[01:04:19.700 --> 01:04:23.220]  don't think oh I'm going to stop supporting because Jones it's over and they say he's
[01:04:23.220 --> 01:04:28.340]  being shut down and he'll be shut down and nobody can stop him when none of that's true
[01:04:28.340 --> 01:04:32.740]  only people that can shut us down is you if you decide to not buy products at info or
[01:04:32.740 --> 01:04:36.500]  store.com and if you decide to stop listening if you decide not to share the articles and

[01:05:59.260 --> 01:06:15.020]  wars MD the answer to 1984 is 1776 live from Austin Texas broadcasting worldwide it's
[01:06:15.020 --> 01:06:27.940]  Alex Jones is now looking to reduce ownership of private vehicles yes the forum claiming
[01:06:27.940 --> 01:06:33.820]  that this is a way to reduce global reliance on critical metals like cobalt and lithium
[01:06:33.820 --> 01:06:40.140]  as they make a push toward green energy dig in give up your car why don't you yeah the
[01:06:40.140 --> 01:06:45.860]  world economic forum sponsors that little get together that boondoggle and Davos every
[01:06:45.860 --> 01:06:54.180]  year why do major private CEOs even go to that thing if this is these are the policies
[01:06:54.180 --> 01:06:58.700]  that the world economic forum are espousing they're essentially saying trying to take
[01:06:58.700 --> 01:07:05.660]  away your free will you can't drive a car and again trying to apply the ideas out of
[01:07:05.660 --> 01:07:11.420]  Europe under the United States Europe has a lot of mass transit it's a very small continent
[01:07:11.420 --> 01:07:19.820]  and North America not so much so stick that idea where the sun doesn't shine well I have
[01:07:19.820 --> 01:07:25.640]  gone to Davos for 20 years for the world economic forum and it's always been an incredible
[01:07:25.640 --> 01:07:32.380]  opportunity to have knob with the leaders of the world it is incredibly well attended
[01:07:32.380 --> 01:07:39.020]  every year so for some reason everybody's getting together globally it has been the
[01:07:39.020 --> 01:07:44.900]  place that all of these people meet every year you're right Leo your thoughts on the
[01:07:44.900 --> 01:07:52.700]  ideas of going green and taking away your private vehicle well obviously when we think
[01:07:52.700 --> 01:07:59.900]  about the history of motor vehicles cars and other transportation it has lifted millions
[01:07:59.900 --> 01:08:05.780]  hundreds of millions of people out of poverty and has changed the dynamic of how we all
[01:08:05.780 --> 01:08:12.260]  live in the quality of our lives so yes why we all want a clean economy and we want a
[01:08:12.260 --> 01:08:20.220]  you know a climate that is sustainable the reality is that a collapsing economy isn't
[01:08:20.220 --> 01:08:26.140]  the answer so there has to be a balance and unfortunately in today's bifurcated world
[01:08:26.140 --> 01:08:30.620]  we get a little bit too much extremism so hopefully we can bring some sense back into
[01:08:30.620 --> 01:08:38.540]  it yeah by the way those CEOs that go to Davos many of them they go on their own private
[01:08:38.540 --> 01:08:46.260]  jet now that's only a two minute 19 second clip and I could teach a college course on
[01:08:46.260 --> 01:08:52.500]  the new world order and how it operates just analyzing that clip and how they responded
[01:08:52.500 --> 01:08:56.060]  does anybody listen to Davos because it's the private arm of the Bilderberg group and the
[01:08:56.060 --> 01:09:01.780]  major finance banks and those big companies don't get the loans and government regulators
[01:09:01.780 --> 01:09:08.420]  come after them if they don't do what they're told that's why almost every motorcycle manufacturer
[01:09:08.420 --> 01:09:14.260]  has announced they're phasing out gas motorcycles and are going to electric did you know that
[01:09:14.260 --> 01:09:20.540]  that's why whether it's Ford or Chevy owned by GM they're announcing a phase out by the
[01:09:20.540 --> 01:09:25.780]  end of the decade no more gas cars no more diesel cars and of course you heard the Davos
[01:09:25.780 --> 01:09:29.420]  group we've told you a hundred times before they announced it are going to say oh sorry
[01:09:29.420 --> 01:09:33.940]  there's not enough material for batteries and batteries are toxic so you just can't
[01:09:33.940 --> 01:09:41.260]  have cars tomorrow's news today yet again and of course all the studies show if people
[01:09:41.260 --> 01:09:45.900]  have cars taken away it'll make them isolated and much poorer that's what they want you
[01:09:45.900 --> 01:09:52.300]  will own nothing you will have nothing and you will like it Dodge will phase out gas
[01:09:52.300 --> 01:10:00.940]  power charger and challenger in 2024 to make way for EV's no more Dodge charger no more
[01:10:00.940 --> 01:10:11.300]  Dodge challenger I've driven both splendid vehicles beautiful inexpensive super fast
[01:10:11.300 --> 01:10:22.180]  the base model goes 200 miles an hour spacious four door with the charger American classic
[01:10:22.180 --> 01:10:32.380]  and gone gone gone gone but even the little tiny cars that the Japanese have to get 50
[01:10:32.380 --> 01:10:36.340]  miles an gallon sorry bye bye and what are the Japanese said because they're engineer
[01:10:36.340 --> 01:10:44.740]  engineers they've come out with Toyota and with Nissan reports dozens of them and said
[01:10:44.740 --> 01:10:50.060]  battery cars don't work they use more carbon to make the car more carbon to make the battery
[01:10:50.060 --> 01:10:57.300]  they don't work it takes more carbon to make the electricity to transfer it to them they're
[01:10:57.300 --> 01:11:08.540]  a fraud look at that beauty and they're just getting rid of all of it not to replace it
[01:11:08.540 --> 01:11:13.300]  with something better but to get rid of cars period so when you hear we've got to get carbon
[01:11:13.300 --> 01:11:18.260]  down in that zero they're talking about you and now they admit they are talking about
[01:11:18.260 --> 01:11:25.380]  you want to play a report here by one of our great reporters euthanasia ad contains dark

[01:11:51.860 --> 01:11:58.580]  to light yet the scyop of state funded assisted suicide seems to be gaining steam by the week
[01:11:58.580 --> 01:12:04.340]  additionally a horrifying commercial from canadian clothing retailer simons pitches the subject
[01:12:04.340 --> 01:12:11.460]  of assisted suicide as a bohemian live laugh love reflection on life's beauty or something
[01:12:11.460 --> 01:12:24.100]  last press are sacred when i imagine my final days i see bubbles i see the ocean i see music

[01:13:12.500 --> 01:13:17.860]  suicidal teens it's a series of daily tasks that are meant to slowly wear down the players
[01:13:17.860 --> 01:13:23.780]  physical and mental well-being over the course of 50 days the entire challenge is overseen
[01:13:23.780 --> 01:13:29.740]  by an anonymous curator who messages and guides the subject through the daily challenges and
[01:13:29.740 --> 01:13:34.580]  holds the player accountable the first few tasks are fairly innocuous like drawing a
[01:13:34.580 --> 01:13:39.620]  picture of a blue whale and taking a photo as proof but then they slowly escalate towards
[01:13:39.620 --> 01:13:46.020]  acts of self-harm in other dangerous situations on the 50th and final day of the challenge
[01:13:46.020 --> 01:13:51.940]  the subject is asked to commit suicide so on this random person on instagram they just
[01:13:51.940 --> 01:13:56.020]  messaged me saying would you like to play a game and I was like sure what game it was
[01:13:56.020 --> 01:14:01.260]  like first you need to type in I am a whale and I did that and I was like okay what's

[01:18:09.020 --> 01:18:16.020]  called vapors they associated these poisonous vapors with cold weather of course it wasn't
[01:18:16.020 --> 01:18:21.420]  the cold weather or catching a chill that killed people what was killing people was a lack

[01:20:01.740 --> 01:20:28.300]  on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[01:20:28.300 --> 01:20:32.180]  we just joined us we're playing a bone selling report that I posted the front page of info
[01:20:32.180 --> 01:20:39.780]  wars dot com and of the live show feed dealing with government sponsored ads produced by
[01:20:39.780 --> 01:20:44.180]  clothing lines in places like canada there's a whole bunch of these ads but here's just
[01:20:44.180 --> 01:20:49.740]  one of them creepy as an asia ad contains dark symbolism linked to teen suicide trend
[01:20:49.740 --> 01:20:55.100]  and this is all test of mind control run by these bots run by these side out groups to
[01:20:55.100 --> 01:21:03.380]  again kill you the shots the lab-created virus of the weaponized marijuana the fentanyl the
[01:21:03.380 --> 01:21:08.820]  human sex trafficking the smuggling all of it is meant to make you depressed and die that's
[01:21:08.820 --> 01:21:13.660]  why the pentagon has psychological systems that they give counseling to the troops for
[01:21:13.660 --> 01:21:17.340]  ptsd that actually make them depressed put them on drugs and they know statistically
[01:21:17.340 --> 01:21:23.100]  makes them commit suicide so you see the suicide rate go way up because that's what they're
[01:21:23.100 --> 01:21:28.140]  being told to condition them to do now even the average psychologist doesn't even know
[01:21:28.140 --> 01:21:31.180]  that the information they've been given and the programs they've been given are causing
[01:21:31.180 --> 01:21:36.860]  this when you pull back you actually learn that those on top do bring all your phone
[01:21:36.860 --> 01:21:42.620]  calls after this but let's finish up with this report the entire challenge is overseen
[01:21:42.620 --> 01:21:48.580]  by an anonymous curator who messages and guides the subject through the daily challenges and
[01:21:48.580 --> 01:21:53.420]  holds the player accountable the first few tasks are fairly innocuous like drawing a
[01:21:53.420 --> 01:21:58.460]  picture of a blue whale and taking a photo as proof but then they slowly escalate towards
[01:21:58.460 --> 01:22:04.820]  acts of self-harm in other dangerous situations on the 50th and final day of the challenge
[01:22:04.820 --> 01:22:11.140]  the subject is asked to commit suicide so this random person on instagram they just messaged
[01:22:11.140 --> 01:22:17.060]  me saying would you like to play a game and I was like sure what game it was like first
[01:22:17.060 --> 01:22:22.260]  you need to type in I am a whale and I did that and I was like okay what's next he said
[01:22:22.260 --> 01:22:29.980]  cut f 57 in your leg and I was like do okay well I actually did cut it in my leg he said
[01:22:29.980 --> 01:22:34.660]  that if I didn't do anything that he could track down where I lived and stuff and that
[01:22:34.660 --> 01:22:37.580]  kind of freaked me out because he said that he was gonna that he could call people and
[01:22:37.580 --> 01:22:42.060]  they could kill my family the man who supposedly created the game a Russian by the name of
[01:22:42.060 --> 01:22:47.500]  Philip Budakin was caught and imprisoned for successfully convincing two teenage girls
[01:22:47.500 --> 01:22:52.740]  to commit suicide though he claims to have convinced far more than that he's quoted
[01:22:52.740 --> 01:22:59.740]  as calling his victims biological waste and said that his project is cleansing society
[01:22:59.740 --> 01:23:05.100]  despite many outlets such as Forbes waving off the challenges and internet rumor there
[01:23:05.100 --> 01:23:10.260]  are plenty of families reporting having lost loved ones to this suicide grooming ritual
[01:23:10.260 --> 01:23:16.220]  worldwide this is basically saying goodbye and this is basically saying goodbye as well
[01:23:16.220 --> 01:23:20.820]  with the blue whale and this is in Russian this is in Russian it's not important yes
[01:23:20.820 --> 01:23:27.900]  did you know that she knew Russian no so let's go back to this abomination of an ad here
[01:23:27.900 --> 01:23:33.300]  was this blue whale used as a calling card for online suicide groomers I don't know about
[01:23:33.300 --> 01:23:41.420]  you but it seems a bit deliberate to me how about the spirals drawn in the sand right
[01:23:41.420 --> 01:23:48.020]  there you be the judge and let me know in the comments below despite its grim overtones
[01:23:48.020 --> 01:23:54.460]  the ad gets the core message right life is beautiful but it's also too short to fall
[01:23:54.460 --> 01:24:01.060]  for tone deaf dystopian psyops like this one consider ads like this as dark foreshadowing
[01:24:01.060 --> 01:24:08.220]  for things to come if you can get out of Canada now it's about to get ugly this is the Psyop
[01:24:08.220 --> 01:24:18.220]  cop for info wars dot com very important report at info wars dot com and ban dot video it's
[01:24:18.220 --> 01:24:24.060]  up to you folks to get this out of the young people you understand this is a war and notice
[01:24:24.060 --> 01:24:31.220]  these are eco terrorist extinction rebellion types that have a thrill of controlling a
[01:24:31.220 --> 01:24:35.540]  thrill of death and have bought in that they're the high priest of getting us to commit cultural
[01:24:35.540 --> 01:24:41.660]  suicide acting out at the low level what the globalist are instilling from the top it is
[01:24:41.660 --> 01:24:47.020]  a deliberate operation to depress you and show you so much ugliness and to make you
[01:24:47.020 --> 01:24:51.420]  so guilty that you're a human and you're killing the blue whales that you're going to now kill
[01:24:51.420 --> 01:24:57.660]  yourself in a heroic act and the people training the kids to do this see them as human garbage
[01:24:57.660 --> 01:25:02.060]  they don't kill themselves no no no they're the psychopaths like bill gates we're going
[01:25:02.060 --> 01:25:08.180]  to oversee our death our destruction and now they're trying to give newborn babies the shot
[01:25:08.180 --> 01:25:12.180]  they had to fire three FDA boards because they wouldn't even give it to teenagers now it's
[01:25:12.180 --> 01:25:19.620]  down to six month olds now they want to give it to babies woman featured in pro euthanasia
[01:25:19.620 --> 01:25:24.580]  commercial wanted to live say friends that's the national post that's the liberal paper
[01:25:24.580 --> 01:25:32.460]  admitting it but they intimidated her into letting him kill her it's a death cult I remember
[01:25:32.460 --> 01:25:38.780]  from a source I had inside pita a full 10 years before it broke who was in the highest
[01:25:38.780 --> 01:25:44.020]  levels of pita who said that they were really a euthanasia death cult and that they were
[01:25:44.020 --> 01:25:48.860]  really run by peter singer and that they would go up in the top of the building and eat steaks
[01:25:48.860 --> 01:25:57.500]  and laugh and make jokes they would make the employees and in Norfolk on the east coast
[01:25:57.500 --> 01:26:04.900]  bring them animals daily and that the head of pita this woman would sit there with a
[01:26:04.900 --> 01:26:14.500]  needle injecting puppies and kittens and getting off on it now I was told that information
[01:26:14.500 --> 01:26:19.780]  and I thought it was unbelievable and then many years later it turns out that that same
[01:26:19.780 --> 01:26:24.620]  persons information was given to private eyes for the beef industry thank god they were
[01:26:24.620 --> 01:26:29.620]  fighting back they staked out the facility and caught them killing hundreds of dogs
[01:26:29.620 --> 01:26:36.300]  and cats a week and dumping them in a dumpster and if you remember that's what basically
[01:26:36.300 --> 01:26:40.340]  damaged pita even today and a bunch of its people that actually believed in animals got
[01:26:40.340 --> 01:26:49.740]  mad and said what are you doing but I'm gonna leave it at that because it's it's it's it's
[01:26:49.740 --> 01:26:56.380]  it's personal and you know I had a family member that I did not know all this was going
[01:26:56.380 --> 01:27:03.300]  on with them until later and later confided in me in this regularly publishing reached
[01:27:03.300 --> 01:27:09.580]  out I guess they knew who they were they gave them an interview but did not say their name
[01:27:09.580 --> 01:27:16.500]  and that information was used by a regulatory to basically annihilate pita it's it's it's
[01:27:16.500 --> 01:27:20.180]  it's another just bizarre thing about my life that I've been so close to all these things
[01:27:20.180 --> 01:27:26.100]  and I remember she was offered a lot of money to put a book out and I said if what you're
[01:27:26.100 --> 01:27:31.860]  saying is true these people are so crazy no one's gonna believe it and I basically did
[01:27:31.860 --> 01:27:38.300]  not go along with the book being published this was like 20 years ago now and it was
[01:27:38.300 --> 01:27:45.180]  just insane I mean and I had a really hard to believe and then it all came out this is
[01:27:45.180 --> 01:27:50.260]  going on what type of people pressure in a big high-rise you know they were in a big
[01:27:50.260 --> 01:27:58.140]  building but all the subordinates weren't allowed up on the top floor to then order their
[01:27:58.140 --> 01:28:01.900]  subordinates to go out and get dogs and cats and bring them to them and then they would
[01:28:01.900 --> 01:28:05.380]  kill them and they'd ask why are you killing them they said well it's abusive to have a
[01:28:05.380 --> 01:28:11.900]  dog or a cat it's abusive to have a dog or a cat not naturally in an environment they're
[01:28:11.900 --> 01:28:17.500]  leading horrible lives well they love their lives but really it was a vampiric need they
[01:28:17.500 --> 01:28:22.340]  couldn't get kids that's what Peter Singer wanted was to abort kids after they're born
[01:28:22.340 --> 01:28:30.180]  remember that they couldn't get kids and so it's like Renfield in the Dracula book he
[01:28:30.180 --> 01:28:34.100]  he wants rats and bugs and he says one day Dracula will you please make me a vampire and
[01:28:34.100 --> 01:28:40.620]  I can actually have kids and so the writer of that famous novel was basically telling
[01:28:40.620 --> 01:28:44.660]  you what's really going on what people are like and you you run into this and it just
[01:28:44.660 --> 01:28:48.740]  sounds too hard to believe and then it's just right there it's unbelievable your phone calls

[01:35:06.060 --> 01:35:10.300]  to teach kids how to commit suicide it's all a giant death cult or sterilize themselves
[01:35:10.300 --> 01:35:14.580]  all i ask is that you save others now tell everybody about the broadcast take clips out
[01:35:14.580 --> 01:35:19.740]  of the show share them with people start your own show do whatever you can sir just be as
[01:35:19.740 --> 01:35:25.420]  vocal as you can you're thanking me i'm begging you and thanking you for caring and tuning
[01:35:25.420 --> 01:35:30.420]  in and i'm begging you now to save others and then tell them to save others we're unstoppable
[01:35:30.420 --> 01:35:35.020]  together we either come together or we're going to fail you understand that absolutely
[01:35:35.020 --> 01:35:39.260]  i send out your links almost every day my girlfriend sends out your links almost every
[01:35:39.260 --> 01:35:44.460]  day and so we're just trying to spread the word as much as we can uh... onto elon must
[01:35:44.460 --> 01:35:50.540]  so i'm in l.a. i work in the uh... film business uh... i'm a digital artist so i've spent the
[01:35:50.540 --> 01:35:56.220]  last twenty years refining my skill set to be to create like the most incredible artwork
[01:35:56.220 --> 01:36:01.140]  for these films that it creates these worlds and what i gotta say what i think elon must
[01:36:01.140 --> 01:36:07.540]  is doing is he's trying to position himself to control the new world order because a i
[01:36:07.540 --> 01:36:12.980]  is going to take over all our jobs and i was talking about that film industry stuff
[01:36:12.980 --> 01:36:20.460]  text to image a i is about to invalidate twenty years of my experience in uh... image making
[01:36:20.460 --> 01:36:25.380]  and art creation it is the most insane thing i've ever seen and if you haven't heard of
[01:36:25.380 --> 01:36:33.780]  chat gpt which is that uh... open a i it it's it's insane it it you can just type in almost
[01:36:33.780 --> 01:36:39.380]  anything it can solve all these problems because it's one of the folks that don't know for folks
[01:36:39.380 --> 01:36:45.340]  that don't know uh... and i've talked to a lot of top people high level they said alex
[01:36:45.340 --> 01:36:51.020]  they don't let you know on siri or these other systems a i how good it is it's dumb down
[01:36:51.020 --> 01:36:55.380]  the public doesn't know how super advanced it already is and it's listening and watching
[01:36:55.380 --> 01:37:01.860]  everything absolutely i'd like i'm i'm literally scared for my job right now because and i'm
[01:37:01.860 --> 01:37:07.300]  on the we're at the very edge of this digital kind of you know work that we do so i'm looking
[01:37:07.300 --> 01:37:10.900]  at it going i don't know if i'm gonna have a job next year or in within the next year
[01:37:10.900 --> 01:37:16.420]  and explain what that means to people the a i is so good that you can tell it what you
[01:37:16.420 --> 01:37:21.700]  want and then it's able to create art that is beautiful and powerful and again that's
[01:37:21.700 --> 01:37:27.980]  the real mark of intelligence absolutely like so it's called mid-journey mid-journey is one
[01:37:27.980 --> 01:37:32.740]  of the different a i's out there and these are available to everyone you type in four
[01:37:32.740 --> 01:37:38.740]  or five words say you know i want a beautiful castle on a hill with a sunset i want it to
[01:37:38.740 --> 01:37:44.620]  be as high resolution and gorgeous as you can make it and it will give you infinite version
[01:37:44.620 --> 01:37:51.140]  of this image and that's what i do for a living all day every day to be twenty years to get
[01:37:51.140 --> 01:37:55.780]  good at doing this you know you know why it's powerful because it's hooked into all of us
[01:37:55.780 --> 01:38:00.900]  stealing our art our culture and then only giving it to you at high speed and so the
[01:38:00.900 --> 01:38:06.380]  key is going to be trademark and copyright with this a i because what it's doing is stealing
[01:38:06.380 --> 01:38:10.820]  so again it's only good at showing us what our mind already has it's basically like a
[01:38:10.820 --> 01:38:15.020]  subconscious because our subconscious is thousands of times more powerful than our conscious
[01:38:15.020 --> 01:38:18.820]  because we can't dive into all that and process it through the cerebral cortex that is our
[01:38:18.820 --> 01:38:23.900]  limited focus and so this is like looking into the subconscious absolutely and so what
[01:38:23.900 --> 01:38:29.420]  i think elon is doing is he knows that this technology is so powerful so he's trying to
[01:38:29.420 --> 01:38:35.740]  position himself to be in control of literally everything he can control the a i he said that
[01:38:35.740 --> 01:38:39.980]  he wants internet x where everything's under his control he knows the open free internet
[01:38:39.980 --> 01:38:43.740]  is we'll get everybody to him so he's acting like he's the savior we'll get everybody
[01:38:43.740 --> 01:38:49.220]  to come to him but in the process he is still exposing the old dinosaurs so he's he's he's
[01:38:49.220 --> 01:38:54.140]  performing a service right now absolutely so it's like it's a double edged sword we
[01:38:54.140 --> 01:38:58.420]  don't i mean what he's doing is great right now but he could turn that other edge on
[01:38:58.420 --> 01:39:02.860]  humanity at the very same time so it's very dangerous last thing i got to remember we
[01:39:02.860 --> 01:39:06.900]  can then create art and literature and culture that's anti-globalist and what's been proven
[01:39:06.900 --> 01:39:11.860]  is the a i can't help them become our slave no matter how they program it so remember
[01:39:11.860 --> 01:39:17.340]  they're still got a tiger by the tail that's a great point that's an absolutely great point
[01:39:17.340 --> 01:39:23.300]  i gotta say one more thing i did a food cleanse years ago i got really sick while i was cleansing
[01:39:23.300 --> 01:39:29.980]  out and i woke up out of this fog and i thought food is mind control so i was like 10 years
[01:39:29.980 --> 01:39:35.660]  ago i went into youtube i said food is mind control i found you and it was so hard to
[01:39:35.660 --> 01:39:39.660]  listen to you back when i was in the matrix and then slowly what happened is i i just
[01:39:39.660 --> 01:39:47.020]  went down the rabbit hole with all your videos and at this point now i'm 49 i do jujitsu
[01:39:47.020 --> 01:39:51.940]  without your supplements i could not compete with like these 20 and 25 30 year olds that

[01:47:52.780 --> 01:47:59.500]  toothache by the way if anybody's having a problem with that but uh i called you about the the four
[01:47:59.500 --> 01:48:04.780]  horses of the apocalypse and i want to talk about the last horse which is in english it's
[01:48:05.420 --> 01:48:11.260]  referred to as pale but it's actually the word chloros which is green it's a green horse and
[01:48:11.260 --> 01:48:16.620]  death rides on the green horse and you know we hear the word green 50 000 times a day you know
[01:48:16.620 --> 01:48:22.460]  if you listen to the media and and the green movement is the human extermination depopulation
[01:48:22.460 --> 01:48:27.980]  transhumanist movement absolutely right the green horse yeah and uh even on your little
[01:48:27.980 --> 01:48:32.380]  images that you show sometimes at the apocalypse you know the fourth horse there's a green you
[01:48:32.380 --> 01:48:40.060]  know on your on your screen but this subject came up of suicide and my son was a gunny sergeant
[01:48:40.060 --> 01:48:46.620]  in the marine corps and he was one of the 22's you know he committed suicide about five years ago
[01:48:46.620 --> 01:48:54.300]  and forgive me i'm getting a little sick out but um PTSD is brainwashing and no one will ever be
[01:48:54.300 --> 01:48:58.700]  able to convince me that that's not what it is you know they call it PTSD like post-traumatic
[01:48:58.700 --> 01:49:04.940]  stress but it's brainwashing and he would tell me things and then he would go off into this
[01:49:04.940 --> 01:49:11.420]  gibberish you know he would try to tell me what had happened over there but it would go off into
[01:49:11.420 --> 01:49:18.060]  this gibberish talk and i tried not to freak out you know but um i knew like where it was headed
[01:49:18.060 --> 01:49:24.700]  i saw it coming you know because um get this the last person he talked to was a CIA psychiatrist
[01:49:25.340 --> 01:49:30.140]  and these people showed up at this funeral now when it was all going on i was so shook up of
[01:49:30.140 --> 01:49:36.220]  course that i didn't realize and but i walked right up to these people i at the funeral they
[01:49:36.220 --> 01:49:42.060]  were all lined up down the side of the church or the you know the chapel we were in and uh
[01:49:42.780 --> 01:49:48.620]  i thought they were funeral directors they all you know look like men in black you know and um
[01:49:51.420 --> 01:49:57.580]  i'm sorry but uh well there's no doubt that what they what they're teaching is causing suicide
[01:49:57.580 --> 01:50:02.140]  and set up teaching people to overcome it and help others and help themselves and and
[01:50:02.700 --> 01:50:06.140]  they teach them to be victims they teach them you do have a problem you're ruined
[01:50:06.140 --> 01:50:10.700]  your life is over uh and it's it's definitely contributing to the suicide
[01:50:11.980 --> 01:50:17.420]  they tell us now that we're the enemy of democracy and all that that's what they tell them
[01:50:17.420 --> 01:50:23.260]  they they beat it into their head however they do it through you know uh inoculations whatever
[01:50:23.260 --> 01:50:28.540]  they however they do their brainwashing that they must kill the enemy you know that's the thing you
[01:50:28.540 --> 01:50:33.660]  must kill the enemy then when they get out of the service they start talking to them and telling them
[01:50:33.660 --> 01:50:40.140]  oh you are the enemy he told me that well that's right what it is is it's not all the government
[01:50:40.140 --> 01:50:44.060]  psychologists but it's a large contingent or leftist shin in there just like they trick the
[01:50:44.060 --> 01:50:49.900]  little girls to commit suicide and cut themselves they go in and tell them you are a bad thing you're
[01:50:49.900 --> 01:50:54.300]  part of a bad thing you're part of the patriarchy and they basically teach them you're bad so they
[01:50:54.300 --> 01:50:59.500]  will destroy themselves like after a war they'll spike a cannon or decommission a weapon they want
[01:50:59.500 --> 01:51:03.500]  these men to kill themselves they're teaching them to kill themselves and i'm sorry to hear
[01:51:03.500 --> 01:51:08.220]  that happen to you god bless you but yeah that's what they're doing ty in tennessee you're on the
[01:51:08.220 --> 01:51:15.660]  here go ahead hey alex thanks for all you do man uh i appreciate it i got a question for you um me
[01:51:15.660 --> 01:51:20.460]  and my wife just found out a couple weeks ago that she's pregnant with our first child and
[01:51:21.020 --> 01:51:26.940]  uh i'm just been trying to sift through all the information on um you know which vaccine they
[01:51:26.940 --> 01:51:32.060]  should get and shouldn't get and i'm just curious about your recommendation on well i mean vaccine
[01:51:32.060 --> 01:51:38.620]  science is a hundred percent real and a hundred percent effective uh if it's not tainted or if
[01:51:38.620 --> 01:51:44.540]  it's not been jacked with on purpose and when i say a hundred percent effective i mean as a group
[01:51:44.540 --> 01:51:48.300]  you give somebody a tetanus shot they're not going to get tetanus if they step on stuff that's
[01:51:48.300 --> 01:51:53.100]  got tetanus the problem is is all the side effects will you survive that so there's always side
[01:51:53.100 --> 01:51:57.820]  effects they lie about how bad they're going to be is up for debate depends on your physiology
[01:51:58.540 --> 01:52:04.780]  but the so-called new shots are not vaccines they're gene therapy they're very experimental
[01:52:04.780 --> 01:52:09.580]  that's why they couldn't get them approved they just got executive order to to to to put it through
[01:52:09.580 --> 01:52:16.860]  so i don't trust the system nothing's better than clean food and water supplementation uh
[01:52:16.860 --> 01:52:23.580]  sunshine and exercise and so i personally none of my children i've got four of them and they all
[01:52:23.580 --> 01:52:27.980]  look like movie stars i'm i'm bragging this is true all four of my children have never had any
[01:52:27.980 --> 01:52:36.540]  shots uh and i had very very few when i was young uh and so again my grandmother's doctor told her
[01:52:36.540 --> 01:52:41.260]  she got polio from the polio vaccine told my grandmother that back in the 50s so
[01:52:41.260 --> 01:52:47.900]  there's been a long line of carnage from these and so vaccines are real technology but you just
[01:52:47.900 --> 01:52:55.500]  can't trust the system uh at any level to take them is my view cool but really that helps helps me
[01:52:55.500 --> 01:52:59.820]  a lot man i mean bill gates says he wants to depopulate the world and he's got his fingers
[01:52:59.820 --> 01:53:06.940]  in almost all the vaccine makers so what's that tell you for sure yeah for sure the only other
[01:53:06.940 --> 01:53:11.420]  question i'd have is uh i've really kind of started reading reading some scriptures and stuff and
[01:53:11.420 --> 01:53:17.340]  i'm just curious your recommendation on on what what bible do you read you know i don't claim to
[01:53:17.340 --> 01:53:22.700]  be the big theologian i sat in a lot of sunday school and a lot of times i'll flip the channels
[01:53:22.700 --> 01:53:28.700]  to watch preachers on tv and i've read a lot of the bible uh but you know i personally just have
[01:53:28.700 --> 01:53:35.660]  a spiritual relationship with god and discernment from the holy spirit and so i i basically operate
[01:53:35.660 --> 01:53:41.420]  off of that and basically if i just follow my the spirit it has all the answers it's never wrong
[01:53:41.420 --> 01:53:45.340]  it's when i don't want to follow it i have issues that's why i do have issues like all of us i'm
[01:53:45.340 --> 01:53:53.180]  falling but if i was you i would read the first few books in the bible i would also read exodus i
[01:53:53.180 --> 01:53:58.860]  would read uh the the three gospels uh and all the red letter stuff with jesus and then i would
[01:53:58.860 --> 01:54:06.300]  read daniel i'd read ezekiel and i would read revelation and then i would uh you know we should
[01:54:06.300 --> 01:54:10.620]  get more trusted theologians on and people that know what's going on to walk through all this but
[01:54:10.620 --> 01:54:17.260]  it's it's all crystal clear uh once you understand it once you see it cool i was just i was curious
[01:54:17.260 --> 01:54:22.460]  if there was a version of the bible that you you think is uh you know more historically accurate
[01:54:22.460 --> 01:54:27.180]  or you know that all of them have been manipulated none of it's perfect but they did get the dead
[01:54:27.180 --> 01:54:32.460]  sea scrolls and then it was pretty much very close uh to what's in the king james version
[01:54:32.460 --> 01:54:38.300]  the issue is is that uh the early churches including the orthodox and the catholic pulled
[01:54:38.300 --> 01:54:42.940]  some of the books out uh and so there are books in the bible that are not there that people should
[01:54:42.940 --> 01:54:47.980]  read as well it doesn't mean it's all you know perfect you need to use the holy spirit to discern
[01:54:47.980 --> 01:54:54.220]  it when you're reading it but i personally like a king james version cool thanks so much for your
[01:54:54.220 --> 01:54:58.140]  help man i appreciate everything you guys do thank you brother god bless you i appreciate your call
[01:54:58.140 --> 01:55:05.100]  let's talk to james and california james you're on the air hello alex yes sir alex during nine
[01:55:05.100 --> 01:55:12.380]  eleven i had a trading desk set up in my apartment at data point i was all over the internet for the
[01:55:12.380 --> 01:55:20.940]  five-year period following nine eleven i was all over drudge during those days uh it wasn't until
[01:55:20.940 --> 01:55:29.980]  2010 that i got a copy of the obama deception that my son gave me i listened to it and watched it
[01:55:31.340 --> 01:55:39.500]  and i recognized your voice but i had never heard your name alex in all those years of being all
[01:55:39.500 --> 01:55:47.500]  over the net i grew to hate charlie shane because he was nine eleven was an inside job i grew to
[01:55:47.500 --> 01:55:53.100]  dislike the sticky sticky chicks because they were talking about things that they shouldn't have been
[01:55:53.100 --> 01:56:01.660]  talking about supposedly so what it shows me alex is how much censorship that was going on in the
[01:56:01.660 --> 01:56:08.540]  internet during that period and how much mind control i was truly under and i've been listening
[01:56:08.540 --> 01:56:18.380]  to you now since 2011 i've been following almost everything you say and i just want to tell you
[01:56:18.380 --> 01:56:23.340]  i love you to death well i love you too brother and we're all imperfect vessels to carry forward
[01:56:23.340 --> 01:56:28.300]  the information but you're absolutely right the censorship's always been there now it's more intense
[01:56:28.300 --> 01:56:33.900]  it's out in the open because the enemy is losing the fight for hearts and minds we are winning the
[01:56:33.900 --> 01:56:39.020]  question is what will the globalists do to try to grab victory from the jaws of defeat that's the
[01:56:39.020 --> 01:56:46.780]  big question that is the question you know and thank god for matt rudge in 2010 and 2011 when
[01:56:46.780 --> 01:56:51.420]  he started finally blinking to you you know well that's why i don't bash grudge you know he got
[01:56:51.420 --> 01:56:55.420]  trump elected more than anybody else out there other than trump he did such a great job for
[01:56:55.420 --> 01:56:59.980]  decades and the best i know is when he asked the republicans for support when he was under
[01:56:59.980 --> 01:57:06.300]  covert attack they didn't help him and didn't support him so he said screw you and basically
[01:57:06.300 --> 01:57:13.820]  leased it to a consortium run by cnn and uh you know he just gave up i guess and but i don't
[01:57:13.820 --> 01:57:19.980]  dislike matt rudge and i admire matt rudge and he's a really smart person and you know i mean i
[01:57:19.980 --> 01:57:25.340]  can't whatever they had on him whatever they did to him uh i mean i forgive him because none of us
[01:57:25.340 --> 01:57:33.500]  are perfect right on alex i love matt rudge and i love you and i don't go to drudge anymore at all
[01:57:33.500 --> 01:57:41.740]  because it's cnn known and that's the way it is out it is it's cnn cnn a subgroup of cnn uh leases it
[01:57:42.780 --> 01:57:45.180]  they they up the lease every year well we'll be right back

[02:00:18.940 --> 02:00:24.940]  information appreciate you brother i was just going to mention that years ago i mean back when
[02:00:24.940 --> 02:00:32.380]  paul harvey was still on the uh pick a radio back in 79 i think it was um paul harvey had mentioned
[02:00:32.380 --> 02:00:40.300]  something about the gay bomb or the sunshine project and um never really stuck with me until
[02:00:40.300 --> 02:00:47.100]  some of this stuff that we see going on with the whole transgender movement uh started taking
[02:00:47.100 --> 02:00:53.100]  place well that's right that's even in the bbc uh guys click web and type in uh pinning on develop
[02:00:53.100 --> 02:00:58.940]  gay bomb a chemical they spray on men uh that basically manipulates their olfactory nerves and
[02:00:58.940 --> 02:01:07.820]  makes them some men attracted to men go ahead well anyway uh yeah so i think what we're seeing right
[02:01:07.820 --> 02:01:15.100]  now is just like the the sunshine project 3.0 the way it feels to me uh you know i watched that interview
[02:01:15.100 --> 02:01:23.660]  with you and yay the other day and he'd mentioned something about porn being a drug and i think
[02:01:23.660 --> 02:01:33.500]  that it probably is it opens the door for those kind of uh proclivities if you will and um who
[02:01:33.500 --> 02:01:39.420]  knows what they can pump through the through the tv and the media that we're visually looking at right
[02:01:39.420 --> 02:01:47.260]  now i watched the movie here a long time ago video drum uh were yeah with james was james was
[02:01:47.260 --> 02:01:55.180]  yeah i bet ironically that's a croninberg film it's excellent it is and it's loosely based off
[02:01:55.180 --> 02:02:04.220]  a true story where they were using uh you know the visual effects through video to brainwashed people
[02:02:04.220 --> 02:02:10.060]  that would uh choose to watch that kind of stuff i think it was snowflakes in the movie but uh
[02:02:10.700 --> 02:02:16.780]  anyway that was really all i had i i'd mentioned to your uh gather that led me on that uh recently
[02:02:16.780 --> 02:02:23.740]  i just saw uh some of those big black coffins that you were uh talking about years ago yeah

[02:06:34.220 --> 02:06:39.980]  quarantine in human history millions of people worldwide who've been quarantined millions of
[02:06:39.980 --> 02:06:45.340]  people in china are once again under collective quarantine in the industrial city of chan show
[02:06:45.340 --> 02:06:50.380]  six point six million residents have been ordered to stay indoors workers in protective suits have
[02:06:50.380 --> 02:06:56.060]  installed metal barriers in some neighborhoods china is reportedly putting suspected covid-19
[02:06:56.060 --> 02:07:01.340]  patients in metal boxes well they're erecting uh sometimes shipping containers that we've seen
[02:07:01.340 --> 02:07:06.940]  a couple of tents as well more than 200 million people in china are in lockdown and are banned
[02:07:06.940 --> 02:07:13.900]  from leaving their home even to buy food long winding lines of buses can be seen in a street
[02:07:13.900 --> 02:07:20.380]  which are taking people to covid-19 quarantine camps 25 million residents ordered confined to
[02:07:20.380 --> 02:07:25.180]  their homes they're using bicycle locks and padlocks just to keep people in this video on your
[02:07:25.180 --> 02:07:30.300]  screen shows officials dragging a man into a quarantine center where the conditions are
[02:07:30.300 --> 02:07:35.340]  appalling to say the least these people locked up in quarantine camps being treated worse than
[02:07:35.340 --> 02:07:42.780]  prisoners now we need to go and look in families to find those people who may be sick and remove them
[02:07:42.780 --> 02:07:48.300]  the judge has ruled for guardianship of this four-month-old baby to be placed into the court
[02:07:48.300 --> 02:07:52.940]  he needs life-saving surgery but his parents don't want him to receive blood from those who
[02:07:52.940 --> 02:07:57.900]  have been vaccinated so this is all about the state's the same worldwide human directed taking
[02:07:57.900 --> 02:08:01.980]  control of your bodies and now saying we're going to put blood product to people that
[02:08:01.980 --> 02:08:07.260]  are having a growing cry on our spike protein in your body we have all the medical reports the
[02:08:07.260 --> 02:08:11.900]  governor of florida has criminal investigations going a big pharma lying about this but they're
[02:08:11.900 --> 02:08:18.540]  still doubling down we don't want blood that potentially could have spike protein we don't
[02:08:18.540 --> 02:08:24.380]  want that we know that that is you know he's got a compromised heart what's happening here is just
[02:08:24.380 --> 02:08:29.980]  the beginning of an authoritarian takeover and it's it's coming for all of us this type of
[02:08:29.980 --> 02:08:35.340]  tyranny is coming to new zealand it is coming to australia it is coming to america it is coming to
[02:08:35.340 --> 02:08:42.460]  the entire world chinese style covid lockdown tyranny is on its way for people who are not
[02:08:42.460 --> 02:08:49.020]  vaccinated lockdown rules will apply to everyone 16 and above it's absolutely mind-boggling that you
[02:08:49.020 --> 02:08:54.700]  could hold healthy law-abiding fully vaccinated citizens in these kind of conditions we have
[02:08:54.700 --> 02:09:00.860]  now a window of opportunity to create this global reset which we all need this is what
[02:09:00.860 --> 02:09:06.540]  communism looks like this is what totalitarianism looks like your child is not yours they will
[02:09:06.540 --> 02:09:12.060]  continue to try to restrict and limit and vaccinate do all of the other things that
[02:09:12.060 --> 02:09:17.500]  we're seeing done in china it's just a matter of time and as their algorithms get more sophisticated
[02:09:17.500 --> 02:09:22.540]  the world economic forum and claus Schwab are not just going to sit back and allow humanity
[02:09:22.540 --> 02:09:33.020]  the freedom that we so clearly desire i respect china's achievements which are tremendous i think
[02:09:33.020 --> 02:09:39.500]  it's um a whole model for many countries this is the social credit score this is breaking you down
[02:09:39.500 --> 02:09:43.660]  locking you up training you to be a slave only let you out again later as long as you follow
[02:09:43.660 --> 02:09:49.020]  all the orders they say they get progressively more tyrannical word bob go i don't know went to a
[02:09:49.020 --> 02:09:53.500]  covered camp never came back they're just training to get used to see them grabbed and rounded up
[02:09:53.500 --> 02:09:59.180]  all around you super hardcore tyranny the model of the great reset and the new world order and
[02:09:59.180 --> 02:10:11.660]  we're going to be here fighting it big time you are listening to an infowars dot com front line
[02:10:11.660 --> 02:10:19.820]  report if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance all right well i've
[02:10:19.820 --> 02:10:23.660]  watched this show before and seen his work and mike adams was talking about a few weeks ago and i
[02:10:23.660 --> 02:10:30.220]  said well let's get bit boy one of the biggest uh crypto news reporters out there to come on the show
[02:10:30.220 --> 02:10:34.460]  and he said i'll come in studio so he and his crew have come here i'm not going to go over his whole
[02:10:34.460 --> 02:10:39.260]  background uh you can find him at bit boy crypto and on twitter at bit boy underscore crypto on
[02:10:39.260 --> 02:10:45.900]  facebook at bit boy crypto bit boy crypto dot com and he's got a whole news division and a lot of
[02:10:45.900 --> 02:10:50.460]  big stuff so we couldn't get a better person in here to talk about ftx and the future of crypto
[02:10:50.460 --> 02:10:54.620]  because i totally support crypto and i think we have alternatives to the central bank digital
[02:10:54.620 --> 02:11:00.940]  currencies they want to bring out and i kind of see ftx as an attempt to blow up the crypto market
[02:11:00.940 --> 02:11:05.900]  while the deep state uh laundered a bunch of money maybe you disagree i'm gonna get your take on that
[02:11:05.900 --> 02:11:12.380]  sam bankman freed the testify before congress remotely he's quite overbooked uh so we've got all
[02:11:12.380 --> 02:11:20.300]  that uh so so first off bit boy good to have you here i appreciate you being in studio uh with us
[02:11:20.300 --> 02:11:24.220]  and so where do you want to start with ftx and all the rest of it yeah i mean you got to start with
[02:11:24.220 --> 02:11:30.780]  ftx right now um it it's a very big week this week as you said uh sam is overbooked so he can't appear
[02:11:30.780 --> 02:11:36.140]  in person at the hearings he's currently in the bahamas uh for people that don't know ftx was one
[02:11:36.140 --> 02:11:42.140]  of the largest exchanges uh in the world and it was insolvent and nobody knew um and we started
[02:11:42.140 --> 02:11:47.340]  figuring out you know maybe a few weeks before everything uh you know unwinding cz from buying
[02:11:47.340 --> 02:11:53.900]  it sold 500 million ftt it's the token of uh ftx and basically crashed the market overnight and it's
[02:11:53.900 --> 02:11:59.180]  had a really hard time recovering but the fact is eight billion dollars at least some people put
[02:11:59.180 --> 02:12:04.460]  that total estimates up to 50 billion dollars for you include all their investments um just gone uh
[02:12:04.460 --> 02:12:09.180]  and it's the biggest insolvency i think we've ever seen and uh you know sam bankman freed just
[02:12:09.180 --> 02:12:14.620]  continues to go on this uh he was the ceo on this tour saying oh i didn't know anything i had no idea
[02:12:14.620 --> 02:12:18.380]  it was missing any of the new york times that's like it's no big deal but what i see is them saying
[02:12:18.380 --> 02:12:23.180]  let's use this to try to take over all the private crypto when he had deep state and the government
[02:12:23.180 --> 02:12:28.300]  regulators all over him supporting him yeah so i think it's a very interesting conversation because
[02:12:28.300 --> 02:12:34.460]  you know when you look at how everything uh you know happened there's one name that everybody
[02:12:34.460 --> 02:12:39.020]  thinks when you think of like gigantic democratic scandals right it's clinton's how high does it
[02:12:39.020 --> 02:12:43.900]  go does it go to the clinton's i don't think this is true this time and the reason is because if you
[02:12:43.900 --> 02:12:49.180]  actually look at what happened how it imploded overnight if the clinton's were involved that
[02:12:49.180 --> 02:12:53.900]  would have never happened you've got politicians everywhere having to make excuses for why they
[02:12:53.900 --> 02:12:59.260]  took money from him and they're trying to distance themselves from sam bankman freed because he is
[02:12:59.260 --> 02:13:03.500]  toxic right now something like that i think what you'll find is the further we get into the story
[02:13:04.220 --> 02:13:09.260]  the sloppier these people become this was not a clean operation from the very beginning they kind
[02:13:09.260 --> 02:13:14.300]  of just went off of intimidation and like mafia type tactics like oh yeah you won't say anything or
[02:13:14.300 --> 02:13:18.700]  else we'll destroy your project that was a common thing they would say what finally brought them
[02:13:18.700 --> 02:13:23.020]  down them trying to take over that big canadian exchange or uh well what what actually brought
[02:13:23.020 --> 02:13:28.460]  them down um was a whistleblower uh that's ultimately what happened there was an insolvency
[02:13:28.460 --> 02:13:32.460]  hole it kept getting bigger and bigger and bigger uh this had a lot to do with the fact that they
[02:13:32.460 --> 02:13:36.940]  were creating counterfeit coins on the exchange and then what was happening is they would just
[02:13:36.940 --> 02:13:42.060]  allow more people to short their short versus long ratio and letter string was out of control at one
[02:13:42.060 --> 02:13:46.700]  point it's like 99 percent shorts that doesn't even make sense on exchange so what happened is
[02:13:46.700 --> 02:13:50.700]  customers would draw the real assets and they would just create more counterfeit tokens on the
[02:13:50.700 --> 02:13:54.460]  site and then insolvency hole just got bigger and bigger and bigger then they had to crash
[02:13:54.460 --> 02:13:58.620]  terraluna crash valedra crash celcius that sounds like a microcosm of the rest of the economy
[02:13:58.620 --> 02:14:04.220]  yeah i know right it sure does um but you know kind of they were trying to fake it till you make it
[02:14:04.220 --> 02:14:10.620]  if they could have got all these acquisitions after they crashed those uh companies nine figure payouts
[02:14:10.620 --> 02:14:14.780]  for you know some of the moves they were making they could have eventually got enough real assets
[02:14:14.780 --> 02:14:18.780]  to kind of counterbalance everything out well sir just from a dumb level i'm an expert like you but
[02:14:18.780 --> 02:14:23.500]  anybody else would already be swatting by the fbi oh he can't come to congress doesn't want to come
[02:14:23.500 --> 02:14:28.860]  to the us he's quite overbooked uh he he says he didn't even know this was going on he lies and
[02:14:28.860 --> 02:14:32.620]  big tv interviews saying i didn't know money was going to his other company yeah i mean this guy's
[02:14:32.620 --> 02:14:37.180]  a crook yeah he's something and you know there was a time where i was trying to maybe give him
[02:14:37.180 --> 02:14:42.780]  the benefit of the doubt because seriously there are bigger players here uh his parents and dan
[02:14:42.780 --> 02:14:46.220]  freedberg these are the most important people in this entire situation oh i agree he looks like a
[02:14:46.220 --> 02:14:51.820]  front guy oh yeah yeah yeah he but he also knows stuff so you know him coming this tour of like
[02:14:51.820 --> 02:14:56.540]  you know new york times obviously with their puff piece uh in his interview there there's a lot of
[02:14:56.540 --> 02:15:02.380]  connections between uh ftx and uh you know new york times and some sketchy dealings there as well
[02:15:02.380 --> 02:15:07.020]  but the fact is is that this guy he just pretends like he doesn't know anything and then two months
[02:15:07.020 --> 02:15:11.180]  ago he was the boy genius that knew everything about you mean that guy's not trustworthy let's
[02:15:11.180 --> 02:15:18.380]  put him back on screen oh god that is the scariest thing i've seen since count chocolate he looks
[02:15:18.380 --> 02:15:23.420]  like count chocolate that's his new code name so what is the fallout of this when we come back from
[02:15:23.420 --> 02:15:28.140]  break what what is the fallout what's going to happen to cryptocurrencies because now the central
[02:15:28.140 --> 02:15:32.860]  banks say they're going to move in it seems like perfect timing for them yeah i mean i i think when
[02:15:32.860 --> 02:15:36.860]  you look at cbdc is coming down the road this is certainly going to be something that you know
[02:15:36.860 --> 02:15:41.820]  congress tries to piggyback on um and tries to roll out these cbdc's and stablecoin regulation
[02:15:41.820 --> 02:15:46.380]  i don't think there's any doubt about that stablecoins feel pretty safe right now compared to
[02:15:46.380 --> 02:15:50.140]  you know the volatile crypto markets well let's say there's anybody saying that cryptocurrencies
[02:15:50.140 --> 02:15:54.140]  fiat it's all fiat at least this has some basis in reality we'll right back
[02:15:57.820 --> 02:16:04.860]  december 2022 is here and we are proud and very excited to announce that free shipping is back

[02:19:16.940 --> 02:19:21.980]  going to go for tucker carlsson i studied the globalist 30 years ago but only 28 years and i knew
[02:19:21.980 --> 02:19:26.220]  they were planning all of this and i warned the public as a modern paul revere but i couldn't

[02:19:55.020 --> 02:20:05.340]  you all for your support. leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[02:20:18.700 --> 02:20:24.700]  well bitcoin boy one of the top bitcoin analysts and broadcasters his own network is here in studio
[02:20:24.700 --> 02:20:31.260]  whether she were getting into the future of bitcoin itself cryptocurrencies the central bank
[02:20:31.260 --> 02:20:37.100]  digital currencies where all this is going yeah i think definitely digital currency is going to be
[02:20:37.100 --> 02:20:40.380]  something that's going to take over our lives for sure right now it seems like a little bit of a
[02:20:40.380 --> 02:20:45.180]  novelty and you look at the prices the volatility and people get scared by that but then when you
[02:20:45.180 --> 02:20:50.860]  look at the real world application of the cbdcs while there are a lot of terrible things about them
[02:20:50.860 --> 02:20:54.620]  they are going to be much more convenient for people and we know you know people tend to choose
[02:20:54.620 --> 02:21:00.460]  convenience over anything else hence why so this is the future people should become experts in it
[02:21:00.460 --> 02:21:04.220]  so that we can't be controlled yeah i think i think that's something that you have to do i mean
[02:21:04.220 --> 02:21:08.060]  one of my biggest mistakes ever in crypto is buying bitcoin in 2012 and not understanding what i was
[02:21:08.060 --> 02:21:12.940]  investing in and uh that's why i set out on this channel to educate people to help them to learn
[02:21:12.940 --> 02:21:17.100]  you know the ins and outs of this industry because when you really grasp it you know this is the
[02:21:17.100 --> 02:21:21.820]  only way we save ourselves from a great reset uh let's talk about that but let's put the go back
[02:21:21.820 --> 02:21:27.260]  to that 12-year graph guys that looks totally controlled to me where anywhere do you see
[02:21:28.140 --> 02:21:34.620]  a six month completely basically flat line that looks that looks could totally manipulate it to me
[02:21:34.620 --> 02:21:38.140]  well i understand why you would say that uh but you have to understand bitcoin operates off
[02:21:38.140 --> 02:21:42.940]  something called uh the four-year cycle i'm a bitcoin four-year cycle fundamentalist
[02:21:42.940 --> 02:21:48.780]  what that means is i believe that all four or every four years the same general thing plays out
[02:21:48.780 --> 02:21:53.740]  it all has to do with bitcoin mining uh there's something called the having every four years
[02:21:53.740 --> 02:21:59.180]  the amount of bitcoin being produced on a daily basis through mining gets cut in half literally
[02:21:59.180 --> 02:22:03.820]  cut 50 percent and so what happens is when that event occurs you get a supply shock and then you
[02:22:03.820 --> 02:22:09.260]  have a dramatic upswing for bitcoin that's when we get the bull runs then it gets overhyped retail
[02:22:09.260 --> 02:22:13.660]  comes in they get wrecked and then you have the one year of straight down action which is right
[02:22:13.660 --> 02:22:19.260]  we're at right now we're kind of right time-wise on the cusp of the maybe the bottom of the market
[02:22:19.260 --> 02:22:25.100]  and then the next year and a half will be very slow accumulation and there's some volatility
[02:22:25.100 --> 02:22:29.420]  you know built in it as well in 2019 for instance you know bitcoin went all the way up to 14 000
[02:22:30.300 --> 02:22:34.780]  is an outlier but in general when you really understand the bitcoin having like that's the
[02:22:34.780 --> 02:22:38.060]  most important thing that people need to understand when you're looking at the prospects for where
[02:22:38.060 --> 02:22:41.980]  bitcoin's going so you're bullish on the future of bitcoin oh yeah yeah very bullish on the future
[02:22:41.980 --> 02:22:46.140]  of bitcoin i do believe that bitcoin eventually becomes the world reserve currency i just think
[02:22:46.140 --> 02:22:50.860]  it's like 25 to 50 years and then it backs assets like gold used to do who do you think really
[02:22:50.860 --> 02:23:00.060]  created it i did no i believe how finney was a creator of bitcoin uh to toshinakamoto obviously
[02:23:00.060 --> 02:23:06.220]  is the moniker that was used a series of uh cypher punks were involved kreg right was probably
[02:23:06.220 --> 02:23:12.300]  involved join us andrew's probably involved uh you know uh nigg zebo probably involved there's
[02:23:12.300 --> 02:23:17.100]  a lot of people that were involved with it but ultimately i think how finney is most likely
[02:23:17.100 --> 02:23:23.340]  the answer for who the main guy was folks i don't know who how finney is yeah so he actually uh was
[02:23:23.340 --> 02:23:28.460]  a computer programmer and uh you know goes back to the libertarian days of cypher punks and wanting
[02:23:28.460 --> 02:23:33.980]  freedom and uh you know financial sovereignty and privacy and your transactions it and this is a guy
[02:23:33.980 --> 02:23:40.220]  who didn't really like the spotlight the interesting thing is is he's dead so he and not suspicious he
[02:23:40.220 --> 02:23:44.220]  had a disease i can't remember which one may was luke eric's disease but it just shows how
[02:23:44.220 --> 02:23:49.660]  innovation is what blows away power structures intrinsically to you name it because they're
[02:23:49.660 --> 02:23:53.580]  definitely they're definitely scared of it oh yeah they're terrified of bitcoin uh i mean when you
[02:23:53.580 --> 02:23:58.780]  look at the prospects of what bitcoin can do for the world it's really scary to the people like
[02:23:58.780 --> 02:24:03.420]  claus wab that want to great reset us uh that want to begin the season ahead of the european union
[02:24:03.420 --> 02:24:07.900]  unelected she said oh this will destroy us we don't have our own system christine will garden yep
[02:24:08.460 --> 02:24:13.580]  yeah i they're going to continue to say things like this in cycles in new cycles based on where
[02:24:13.580 --> 02:24:17.420]  the price is so you know when everything is going down you know they want to pile on it say it's
[02:24:17.420 --> 02:24:21.420]  dangerous it's dangerous uh but when the price is going up well she was saying if they don't get
[02:24:21.420 --> 02:24:27.340]  their own it'll destroy their power oh yeah so so cbdc's are something that is the counterbalance
[02:24:27.340 --> 02:24:33.180]  to bitcoin because bitcoin is open and permissionless and cbdcs are going to be closed in permission
[02:24:33.180 --> 02:24:36.620]  but don't they get that'll drive everybody to bitcoin they're not going to want to be in the
[02:24:36.620 --> 02:24:42.380]  controlled system there's not a better advertisement uh for bitcoin than uh when you look at the cbdc
[02:24:42.380 --> 02:24:46.860]  something you know i do a lot of work with um uh we have a bill right now that we're going to be
[02:24:46.860 --> 02:24:52.060]  making public clear this month trying to solve some regulation uh in in the crypto world but one
[02:24:52.060 --> 02:24:57.180]  thing that we need to start thinking about is these cbdcs are going to become a reality uh is
[02:24:57.180 --> 02:25:02.460]  we got to make sure we put in some regulation to stop social credit scores from happening
[02:25:02.460 --> 02:25:06.780]  before they even happen and that's what they're trying to push them for yeah absolutely i mean
[02:25:06.780 --> 02:25:11.500]  you're going to be able to spend your money so so the governments are doing this we need to stop
[02:25:11.500 --> 02:25:16.060]  the social credit score now yeah i i think that's something that's very important to do because
[02:25:16.060 --> 02:25:20.940]  you know nobody's talking about this everybody's seeing the uh the episode of black mirror where
[02:25:20.940 --> 02:25:25.580]  uh you know you can't rent a car unless you have a certain score and things like that so
[02:25:25.580 --> 02:25:30.140]  it's terrifying somebody's got to put the foot down and say let's get ahead of this and stop this
[02:25:30.140 --> 02:25:34.780]  before it actually becomes a problem because that's why we got to educate people yeah absolutely
[02:25:34.780 --> 02:25:37.900]  i remember just like four years ago still congress would have to google hearings they go
[02:25:38.460 --> 02:25:43.660]  do you track users no we don't they would just lie knowing the congress had no idea like
[02:25:44.540 --> 02:25:48.620]  yeah shadow banning doesn't exist you know that's what uh jack dorsi said and uh
[02:25:49.500 --> 02:25:54.140]  i was in that hearing when he said oh were you yeah oh wow you know it exists for and i was
[02:25:54.140 --> 02:25:57.900]  already shadow banned yeah i was already he's like no it doesn't exist we don't censor anybody
[02:25:57.900 --> 02:26:01.900]  debunked you know that's our favorite phrase debunked let me ask you this question we're
[02:26:01.900 --> 02:26:05.580]  gonna do everything you want coming up here the expert who do you think gave us eight million
[02:26:05.580 --> 02:26:11.020]  dollars in bitcoin which we was saved the company but we have no idea gave you a eight million
[02:26:11.020 --> 02:26:15.500]  dollars so you know about that no i didn't know about that yeah somebody early in the year did that
[02:26:15.500 --> 02:26:20.700]  wow well you're welcome yeah no i mean i was already a bitcoin supporter but boy i tell you
[02:26:20.700 --> 02:26:24.780]  yeah well i mean it's it's good there's a lot of money floating out there uh there was recently a guy
[02:26:24.780 --> 02:26:30.380]  who uh just got arrested and he's on trial i think he's going to plead a very low charge
[02:26:30.380 --> 02:26:35.980]  he had 51 000 bitcoin from silk road he created this way that he could go on to silk road back
[02:26:35.980 --> 02:26:42.620]  in 2012 and basically buy trend or send transactions through so fast that he could like quadruple every
[02:26:42.620 --> 02:26:48.940]  amount that he asked to withdraw and he had like was it 3.6 billion dollars he was just giving away
[02:26:48.940 --> 02:26:53.260]  bitcoin like it was out of control because you know 100 bitcoin was nothing to him so eight million
[02:26:53.260 --> 02:26:56.780]  dollars to somebody like that uh to a whale it's just not that much money because they've had it
[02:26:56.780 --> 02:27:01.100]  forever they literally saved this operation we'll be shut down now if it wasn't for whatever that was
[02:27:01.100 --> 02:27:06.540]  well you know i said i had like i think 300 uh i mean something like 300 million in bitcoin
[02:27:06.540 --> 02:27:10.700]  sitting on that's amazing i think what what has happened they never touched it by the way it was
[02:27:10.700 --> 02:27:16.060]  created 2016 it just sits there the only money they ever spent was on us the rest just sits there
[02:27:16.060 --> 02:27:19.580]  well i think it's a very important conversation to look at uh you know kind of what you've been
[02:27:19.580 --> 02:27:24.860]  going through is the new way to cancel people is through canceling them financially and that's
[02:27:24.860 --> 02:27:30.140]  something that bitcoin fights against as well uh because exactly bitcoin doesn't put you in the
[02:27:30.140 --> 02:27:34.460]  social credit score it gets you out of it yeah absolutely and people gotta wake up to that and
[02:27:34.460 --> 02:27:39.660]  look this cbdc is coming very fast um i believe it's gonna be here in three years i believe usdc
[02:27:39.660 --> 02:27:46.540]  is gonna be uh the uh backed by circle and coinbase it's going to become the the for those that don't
[02:27:46.540 --> 02:27:50.620]  know or the new listeners the federal reserve announced it's coming out of the digital currency
[02:27:50.620 --> 02:27:55.340]  yeah so they they have fed now which is a kind of a middle of the road program but ultimately
[02:27:55.340 --> 02:28:01.660]  they are doing one in 2020 drone pal said that yet they were open to using a private company
[02:28:02.220 --> 02:28:06.380]  to to work with to create the digital dollar well obviously circle and coinbase they already have
[02:28:06.380 --> 02:28:10.940]  usdc and that was kind of a dog whistle that that is going to ultimately become uh you know what
[02:28:10.940 --> 02:28:14.540]  we're all going to be using and it's something where you're not going to be able to fight it
[02:28:14.540 --> 02:28:19.660]  but it is going to basically be a walking advertisement for financial privacy in in bitcoin
[02:28:20.220 --> 02:28:24.220]  why can't we fight it why can't we say no the central bank digital currencies
[02:28:25.180 --> 02:28:29.980]  well it's digital money and everything i get it they're gonna implement it and they'll do programs
[02:28:29.980 --> 02:28:35.340]  where they give it away at first uh it's just it's yeah well i think the invention of dynamite
[02:28:35.340 --> 02:28:39.260]  it's not going to be stopped i think you have to understand the bigger play here the bigger play
[02:28:39.260 --> 02:28:45.260]  for the cbdc for the digital dollar is to kick the can down the road in our 20 to 30 years on
[02:28:45.260 --> 02:28:49.820]  inflation and on the fiat that's right it creates a new fiat bubble yes because what it does is all
[02:28:49.820 --> 02:28:55.340]  of a sudden we've got a big demand problem because our supply problem died of control right with it
[02:28:55.340 --> 02:29:02.380]  hold on let's talk about it yeah introducing our new incredible supplement line in four wars md
[02:29:02.380 --> 02:29:07.660]  now in 60 seconds it's hard to tell you how incredible these products are but all of these

[02:29:51.980 --> 02:30:01.420]  and info war store dot com the tip of the spear throughout this entire process the only thing
[02:30:01.420 --> 02:30:07.020]  that made any republican victories tonight possible the only thing that made any resistance to the
[02:30:07.020 --> 02:30:13.260]  war machine machine possible the only thing that made any opposition to the lockdowns and the mask
[02:30:13.260 --> 02:30:18.460]  mandates and the school shutdowns and and the forced vaccines and the dangerous drugs possible
[02:30:19.100 --> 02:30:24.860]  made any resistance to it possible was people continuing to support info wars despite the
[02:30:24.860 --> 02:30:30.860]  massive lawfare being waged against info wars despite the media defamatory libelous campaign
[02:30:30.860 --> 02:30:36.940]  against info wars the ordinary people the everyday people that buy products that make their own lives

[02:30:59.980 --> 02:31:08.220]  sometimes that we are still live on air broadcasting free worldwide and it seems quite real that things
[02:31:08.220 --> 02:31:16.220]  can change in an instant things are getting very weird and it's definitely more difficult than ever
[02:31:16.220 --> 02:31:21.580]  to even know what's going on but we'll keep doing our best so long as you keep us on the air

[02:31:58.620 --> 02:32:03.580]  so when i first started taking survival shield basically i was 275 pounds i was overweight
[02:32:03.580 --> 02:32:08.460]  i had brain fog like you wouldn't believe i was barely holding on to a job and i heard
[02:32:08.460 --> 02:32:12.620]  dr group on your show and i listened to it so the first one i got was the original survival
[02:32:12.620 --> 02:32:17.500]  shield the x1 and it worked pretty good and then shortly thereafter you came out with x2 you had
[02:32:17.500 --> 02:32:21.100]  you know with a deep burden source you know and i got really excited about that so i took it and
[02:32:21.100 --> 02:32:27.580]  man in two weeks i went from brain fog to like literally like my brain was enlightened you know
[02:32:27.580 --> 02:32:32.860]  i could think again i could connect with people again and over the course of the next couple of
[02:32:32.860 --> 02:32:37.740]  years i got my health back and i religiously took basically all of your supplements they're all
[02:32:37.740 --> 02:32:42.460]  absolutely amazing supplements the one i like recently is knockout literally like if you want
[02:32:42.460 --> 02:32:46.940]  to sleep just take it it's amazing it works but anyway so the point is we have to get ourselves
[02:32:46.940 --> 02:32:51.980]  clean we have to break free of the globalist system and the only way to do that is to take our own
[02:32:51.980 --> 02:32:56.620]  help into our own hand beautifully said brother i thank you so much for calling godspeed
[02:32:59.500 --> 02:33:05.500]  leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[02:33:05.500 --> 02:33:14.540]  from the front lines of the information war it's alex jones
[02:33:16.540 --> 02:33:21.900]  well the mighty bit boy is here in studio with us i've been asking a lot of questions don't try to
[02:33:21.900 --> 02:33:29.420]  give you the floor to cover the the range of the latest cryptocurrency bitcoin uh central bank
[02:33:29.420 --> 02:33:35.020]  digital currency scg future we're looking at yeah i think the most important thing for people to
[02:33:35.020 --> 02:33:40.220]  understand is that this market is cyclical and i talked about a little bit ago about the four-year
[02:33:40.220 --> 02:33:45.580]  cycles right now we're in a time where we should be on a downswing and we had ftx this gigantic
[02:33:45.580 --> 02:33:50.380]  debacle right well every single time we have a bear market we have these debacles we had what we
[02:33:50.380 --> 02:33:57.180]  called the hash wars a war between bitcoin cash and bitcoin sv and bitmain back in 2018 you're
[02:33:57.180 --> 02:34:02.620]  back to 2014 you had mount gox which is something that 90 percent of all bitcoin transactions
[02:34:02.620 --> 02:34:06.860]  were running through mount gox got completely hacked sealed still dealing with the repercussions of
[02:34:06.860 --> 02:34:11.420]  that to this day so every bear market it might look a little bit different right now we're dealing
[02:34:11.420 --> 02:34:17.180]  with what we call the contagion which is all the fallout uh from ftx i tend to believe that uh
[02:34:17.180 --> 02:34:21.740]  we're getting close to the end of that if we haven't already seen the bottom as well because
[02:34:21.740 --> 02:34:25.420]  something i think about is all this bitcoin is locked up on these insolvent exchanges
[02:34:25.420 --> 02:34:30.220]  and nobody can sell it so where we might see the downward action of bitcoin go a little bit further
[02:34:30.220 --> 02:34:35.020]  to 10 to 14 thousand dollars um you know i think there's a chance we bought them because nobody
[02:34:35.020 --> 02:34:40.380]  can sell bitcoin because it's locked up well once something gets this big and all the governments
[02:34:40.380 --> 02:34:44.940]  the corporation is trying to adopt a copy of it or a system they can program and control it's not
[02:34:44.940 --> 02:34:49.740]  an open free system i mean i don't see how it goes away when it's the original real mccoy and still
[02:34:49.740 --> 02:34:55.500]  the open and most free system there is yeah absolutely bitcoin is not going anywhere and this
[02:34:55.500 --> 02:34:58.620]  is something that a lot of people are confused about who first get into crypto and start hearing
[02:34:58.620 --> 02:35:03.180]  about these cbdcs they'll say like oh well you know these cbdcs are going to take over crypto
[02:35:03.180 --> 02:35:08.460]  there's no reason to invest money in it anymore it's going to go away no cbdcs are completely
[02:35:08.460 --> 02:35:13.340]  separate from normal crypto people are still going to want speculative assets including
[02:35:13.340 --> 02:35:19.020]  ethereum or cardano so the other all coins as well to invest in that's separate than us using
[02:35:19.020 --> 02:35:23.180]  basically a stablecoin using a dollar the way we use dollar and they call those stablecoins
[02:35:23.180 --> 02:35:26.460]  what they admit with the central bank digital currencies they're going to be able to up them
[02:35:26.460 --> 02:35:30.220]  and down them while they're in your wallet so they're really not stable yeah having a government
[02:35:30.220 --> 02:35:34.940]  backing it is the opposite of being stable now oh absolutely i mean what is a government's worth
[02:35:34.940 --> 02:35:39.980]  right now not very much uh you know so i think that when you look at what's coming with them
[02:35:39.980 --> 02:35:46.300]  expanding the digital dollar we're going to see the world reserve currency go from the us dollar
[02:35:46.300 --> 02:35:54.460]  to the us digital dollar i think the death of america's uh financial uh you know superpower
[02:35:54.460 --> 02:35:58.700]  has been foretold a little bit too early i i think china is not really that big of a threat to
[02:35:58.700 --> 02:36:03.740]  his financial i think moving to a digital dollar as the world reserve currency that's going to open
[02:36:03.740 --> 02:36:08.220]  up the demand insane it's going to be the way that they're going to be able to turn the money
[02:36:08.220 --> 02:36:12.460]  printer back on a digital money printer now and uh be able to kick the can down the road i they have
[02:36:12.460 --> 02:36:17.740]  to the fiat system is going to collapse at some point uh but we're not there yet so how do people
[02:36:17.740 --> 02:36:22.060]  position themselves be educated about this and really be experts in it because i mean whether
[02:36:22.060 --> 02:36:24.700]  i want to know about this or not i'm going to have to know about it because that's where the
[02:36:24.700 --> 02:36:29.260]  future is going yeah well it's a great time for me to plug my book uh because the the fact is we
[02:36:29.260 --> 02:36:34.300]  have a book uh catching up to crypto it actually uh publishes on january 12th uh we're doing a big
[02:36:34.300 --> 02:36:38.460]  book tour we're going to 14 cities oh good well come on once it's here i want to read it yeah yeah
[02:36:38.460 --> 02:36:43.500]  absolutely so the situation is what i've learned through doing youtube is that what we consider
[02:36:43.500 --> 02:36:48.140]  to be beginner content it's not actually beginner content it's still above most people's heads so
[02:36:48.140 --> 02:36:52.220]  what this book catching up to crypto does is it basically takes my 10 years in the crypto world
[02:36:52.860 --> 02:36:58.460]  and gives it to you so that you're caught up to a point where you can then go watch youtube videos
[02:36:58.460 --> 02:37:03.180]  or read other books or get into different niches and and really understand all the elements and
[02:37:03.180 --> 02:37:08.380]  essence of not just bitcoin but crypto in general and blockchain as well um you know we we look at
[02:37:08.380 --> 02:37:14.700]  as filling the gap between the person who comes to crypto and then being a true beginner well
[02:37:14.700 --> 02:37:19.340]  governments are admitting they want so-called stablecoins that they can manipulate the history of
[02:37:19.340 --> 02:37:23.420]  they can make things quote secret so it really won't be a real blockchain it'll just be this whole
[02:37:23.420 --> 02:37:28.940]  rig deal where they can frame people really easy with us yeah well you know what's legal today might
[02:37:28.940 --> 02:37:32.940]  not be legal tomorrow you know you got to keep that in mind when it comes to um you know basically
[02:37:33.820 --> 02:37:39.340]  what's coming in terms of uh you know the the the future you never know what's the world is
[02:37:39.340 --> 02:37:43.900]  going to look like right like maybe eating meat will be against the law at some point and they
[02:37:43.900 --> 02:37:48.620]  can retroactively go and find all the times that you hadn't had an iceberg uh through their permission
[02:37:48.620 --> 02:37:54.060]  blockchain so it's different it's not open source it's not a free system uh but it is something
[02:37:54.060 --> 02:37:58.220]  i've always said especially looking at china and the ccp and all the stuff that they do
[02:37:58.940 --> 02:38:03.820]  blockchain is meant for good but that doesn't mean it's going to be used for good for sure
[02:38:03.820 --> 02:38:08.860]  it's pandora's box that we can certainly use for negative and control and and power uh and just
[02:38:08.860 --> 02:38:14.380]  kind of continue the the greed of man i guess you could say or we can build a different system money
[02:38:14.380 --> 02:38:19.900]  that's completely trackable so expanding on that what are the good coins what are the good systems
[02:38:19.900 --> 02:38:25.340]  is is everything bad except bitcoin uh well you know i'm a big proponent of altcoins i like a lot
[02:38:25.340 --> 02:38:31.180]  of altcoins i i like ethereum i like cardano uh these are two competing what we call layer one
[02:38:31.180 --> 02:38:36.460]  platforms uh they're gonna try to basically become the decentralized version of the internet
[02:38:36.460 --> 02:38:41.100]  and what i mean by that is there's not one point of control that can be taken out uh and and when
[02:38:41.100 --> 02:38:45.660]  you look at bitcoin is digital gold which is really what it's become uh the fact is is that
[02:38:45.660 --> 02:38:50.620]  there's only so many people out there that want to invest in a hedgeable asset right like i know
[02:38:50.620 --> 02:38:54.220]  in your world you know people who own precious metals the average person they might know a
[02:38:54.220 --> 02:38:58.860]  couple people that own gold right but bitcoin's more exciting so a younger generation wants to
[02:38:58.860 --> 02:39:04.220]  get in it but the fact is is that the decentralized internet has more value and i think that's
[02:39:04.220 --> 02:39:09.260]  something to really look at so anything that's a layer one platform like cardano like ethereum i
[02:39:09.260 --> 02:39:15.580]  think they're absolutely huge uh you know we're big on xrp we love xrp because the sec has gone
[02:39:15.580 --> 02:39:21.260]  after them and we hate the sec for sure but the whole thing is uh they do work with banks to
[02:39:21.260 --> 02:39:25.820]  to make international cross-border settlements much easier it's actually kind of similar to bitcoin
[02:39:25.820 --> 02:39:31.820]  in terms of it's a network of value not a network of information the current swiss system that we
[02:39:31.820 --> 02:39:37.340]  have the very international bank processes it's basically hey let's move this here and then we'll
[02:39:37.340 --> 02:39:43.100]  actually move the money down the road it's a big long process it takes a week with xrp when that
[02:39:43.100 --> 02:39:47.820]  on demand liquidity hits for all the banks that it's signing up and of course the sec case goes away
[02:39:47.820 --> 02:39:51.500]  now you're looking at settlements in like 30 seconds it's going to make the world economic
[02:39:51.500 --> 02:39:55.740]  system a lot faster and so how's that going to keep people like bloomberg out with all their
[02:39:55.740 --> 02:40:02.060]  flash trading well i mean that that's a great question when it comes to uh you know the traditional
[02:40:02.060 --> 02:40:05.980]  stock market bros we like to call them i'm not big on stocks i don't really care about stocks i just
[02:40:05.980 --> 02:40:10.940]  like crypto uh you know my experience in stocks is i own peloton and coinbase if that'll tell you
[02:40:10.940 --> 02:40:15.740]  anything about how bad i am at stocks uh but we want to keep these kind of like traditional finance
[02:40:15.740 --> 02:40:20.620]  people out of crypto you're kevin oh leary's we want those people out of crypto uh you know
[02:40:20.620 --> 02:40:24.940]  your sam bingman freeds everybody he's connected to we want these people out of crypto because
[02:40:24.940 --> 02:40:31.340]  we cannot let these people turn what's meant to be an open decentralized system into the same
[02:40:31.340 --> 02:40:36.700]  old thing well sure anytime harvard gets involved that's really the state department cia and that's
[02:40:36.700 --> 02:40:40.380]  yeah that's the deep state well you know it because anytime you ever met someone who went to harvard
[02:40:40.380 --> 02:40:45.820]  that's the first thing they'll tell you oh it's harvard yeah i went to harvard so a lot of the
[02:40:45.820 --> 02:40:50.780]  folks that went there but it's a certain core group uh of every race color and creed but it's
[02:40:50.780 --> 02:40:55.820]  it's a harvard mafia we found well i mean i don't doubt that at all uh there's a stand for mafia too
[02:40:55.820 --> 02:41:01.340]  and including uh you know sam bingman freeds parents absolutely so what's the other big
[02:41:01.340 --> 02:41:07.980]  crypto news right now um i think one thing that people are looking at is uh finance and tether
[02:41:07.980 --> 02:41:14.060]  these are finance is the biggest exchange in the world tether is usd t it's a competitor of usdc
[02:41:14.060 --> 02:41:18.060]  that we were trying to buy a little bit earlier uh and there's a lot of questions about the
[02:41:18.060 --> 02:41:23.420]  solvency of these two entities uh one is a stable coin and one is an exchange and i think really
[02:41:23.420 --> 02:41:27.660]  what you're seeing is people want them to fail the most and it's like this really negative attitude
[02:41:27.660 --> 02:41:34.700]  that's very uh you know apropos for a bear market here's the truth no company in crypto that has
[02:41:34.700 --> 02:41:41.340]  been around for more than five years is completely clean it was an emerging technology people made
[02:41:41.340 --> 02:41:46.140]  decisions that's a wild wild west yeah yeah exactly wild wild west and and i think that
[02:41:46.140 --> 02:41:51.180]  to judge all these companies for the way that they built their empires now that they're solvent and
[02:41:51.180 --> 02:41:56.140]  now that they've uh you know basically faked it till they made it i think it's just counterproductive
[02:41:56.140 --> 02:42:01.100]  i think what we got to do is looking forward how can we keep this from happening again to
[02:42:01.100 --> 02:42:04.940]  where we have companies that have a lot of questionable practices rising up now that's
[02:42:04.940 --> 02:42:10.700]  why i think you know regulation is going to come in for sure so um i think really when you look at
[02:42:10.700 --> 02:42:16.540]  tether specifically and you look at deltech bank and you look at uh moonstone bank these are some
[02:42:16.540 --> 02:42:21.900]  very very sketchy things uh with some very very sketchy pasts but ultimately i think they have
[02:42:21.900 --> 02:42:25.900]  all of the you're saying the technology is sound but just because anything big and huge is going to
[02:42:25.900 --> 02:42:31.180]  have weirdos on it uh yeah i think i think there's a good way to say it um you know basically this
[02:42:31.180 --> 02:42:36.060]  is a cutting-edge technology and you're always going to get a certain type of person that wants
[02:42:36.060 --> 02:42:39.500]  to be interested in that including people that like angle well i know one of the reasons you're
[02:42:39.500 --> 02:42:42.620]  popular i know who you are for years is because you've made some accurate predictions i want to
[02:42:42.620 --> 02:42:45.980]  get the actual technicals and numbers from you when we come back with these graphs on when you
[02:42:45.980 --> 02:42:49.980]  think bitcoin is going to start going back up and what you see even in the long term future

[02:47:33.420 --> 02:47:38.940]  all right we're back live talking about the future the future is now with bit boy crypto
[02:47:38.940 --> 02:47:43.980]  or the top top show host out there covering crypto i can ask a lot of questions but you're the
[02:47:43.980 --> 02:47:48.380]  expert what else you want to impart to the audience um i think it's really important that people
[02:47:48.380 --> 02:47:53.500]  understand what these hearings are uh this week that are going on uh we're gonna see basically
[02:47:53.500 --> 02:48:00.380]  the new ceo of ftx as well as sam bangman freed appearing remotely and these hearings led by
[02:48:00.380 --> 02:48:05.820]  maxine waters now say what you want about maxine waters and and i certainly have in the past
[02:48:05.820 --> 02:48:10.940]  she has been on this situation i've never heard a politician answer question the way she answered
[02:48:10.940 --> 02:48:15.660]  it about political donations uh basically sam bangman freed had given so much money to democratic
[02:48:15.660 --> 02:48:20.220]  party she was one of the people that gave it to her uh they gave to you and she was asked on an
[02:48:20.220 --> 02:48:25.340]  interview what are you gonna do if this money turns out you know to be bad and she's like well i
[02:48:25.340 --> 02:48:29.740]  guess we're gonna have to pretty much do something about it because it's not good money like admitting
[02:48:29.740 --> 02:48:33.580]  that there was a problem uh you know with the money that came in and i can tell you this
[02:48:34.220 --> 02:48:38.620]  maxine waters and several of the other politicians they are pissed i think that's what people don't
[02:48:38.620 --> 02:48:42.860]  understand for these hearings a lot of people are thinking this is a big setup and you know
[02:48:42.860 --> 02:48:46.860]  they're gonna play patty cakes with sam bangman freed stuff you know all of the politicians
[02:48:46.860 --> 02:48:52.300]  in washington took money from ftx they are pissed they are going to be out for blood uh going after
[02:48:52.300 --> 02:48:56.300]  him because he's made them all look absolutely terrible so it's gonna be really interesting to
[02:48:56.300 --> 02:49:01.980]  see what happens this week and i can tell you this uh we actually directly gave a gigantic
[02:49:01.980 --> 02:49:07.820]  packet of evidence uh for all the wrongdoings for uh you know from ftx and sam himself uh directly
[02:49:07.820 --> 02:49:12.540]  to the the finance committee there so they've got some a lot of stuff that we've been sitting on for
[02:49:12.540 --> 02:49:16.780]  months um and it's going to be interesting to see if it comes up because there's no there's no
[02:49:16.780 --> 02:49:22.220]  wriggling out of telephone calls that are recorded and videos that are recording them admitting
[02:49:22.220 --> 02:49:26.620]  crazy stuff didn't blow up in their face to larry david ad where it shows all the inventions he says
[02:49:26.620 --> 02:49:31.580]  oh the wheels no good oh the printing presses no good oh the lightbulbs no good and then he says
[02:49:31.580 --> 02:49:37.340]  oh yeah ftx is no good it turned out it is yeah no good yeah that one aged like fine wine i guess
[02:49:37.340 --> 02:49:41.820]  i think when you look at what they were doing you know they had a 135 million dollar deal with the
[02:49:41.820 --> 02:49:47.900]  miami arena for the naming rights they didn't even have an accountant they did not even have an
[02:49:47.900 --> 02:49:52.060]  accountant when they made that deal they just printed new coins yeah these were new coins they
[02:49:52.060 --> 02:49:57.500]  the you know flywheel tokens is what we call them sam actually made or created a video maybe a couple
[02:49:57.500 --> 02:50:02.220]  years ago where he explained how you can create tokens out of nothing and then prove their value
[02:50:02.220 --> 02:50:07.180]  by trading them against other coins you created and it really is just amazing that we all just sat
[02:50:07.180 --> 02:50:12.620]  there and like you know ignored all this what about nfts because i know there's a bunch of scams
[02:50:12.620 --> 02:50:17.260]  people overvalue them but for me to have a piece of art and then you create a digital copy that
[02:50:17.260 --> 02:50:22.620]  allows you to certify that it's a real piece of art from that person for me that has a value
[02:50:22.620 --> 02:50:26.780]  and then to make variants of that has a value because you know everybody's always used art as
[02:50:26.780 --> 02:50:30.860]  an undercover kind of black market currencies that seem kind of next level i think they they
[02:50:30.860 --> 02:50:35.180]  abused it it went too far all the art was crap but it's just a shame that they've discredited
[02:50:35.180 --> 02:50:40.860]  nfts so bad well once again we're in the down part of the cycle nfts will be back i think they'll
[02:50:40.860 --> 02:50:45.980]  look a little bit different coming up in the next in the next bull run whereas you won't see as many
[02:50:45.980 --> 02:50:51.180]  of what we call a generative trait nfts which are like your board apes or your crypto punks it's
[02:50:51.180 --> 02:50:56.620]  usually a combination of you know factors that go into making one piece you might get a hat you
[02:50:56.620 --> 02:51:02.700]  might get a shirt you might get a monkey whatever that was all the rage in the last bull market
[02:51:02.700 --> 02:51:05.820]  that's going to die out some and some of those winners are going to come more to the forefront
[02:51:05.820 --> 02:51:12.220]  like board apes i'm very interested to see where gaining nfts come because my kids love fortnite
[02:51:12.220 --> 02:51:15.980]  you know they love to play fortnite well they don't get to take their costumes with them anywhere
[02:51:15.980 --> 02:51:20.380]  so once that stuff starts getting on the blockchain it can be resold on a secondary market i think
[02:51:20.380 --> 02:51:24.300]  that's going to be really big as well for nfts i think what you said about the art world i mean
[02:51:24.300 --> 02:51:29.500]  you know we know the art world is one giant uh money laundering scheme right um so if you ever
[02:51:29.500 --> 02:51:34.220]  watch billions they show you exactly how it works there um so i do think art has its place though
[02:51:34.220 --> 02:51:40.860]  uh you know when it comes in nfts there are more and more uh upper echelon kind of uh artists that
[02:51:40.860 --> 02:51:47.820]  are doing these kinds of uh nfts selling one-of-ones uh a friend of mine jessica uh ragsy she was on
[02:51:47.820 --> 02:51:52.620]  the show lego masters she has created like three one-of-one sets now that's what i like where and
[02:51:52.620 --> 02:51:58.140]  you also get a physical copy or or or just one digital or both of that that seems very real
[02:51:58.140 --> 02:52:04.380]  yeah well what she did was really cool because she actually created um a physical piece of art
[02:52:04.380 --> 02:52:08.220]  that was like an apple with some aluminum foil on it and some screws it's supposed to like be a
[02:52:08.220 --> 02:52:14.300]  commentary on technology but you got the digital version of the nft but there was actually a real
[02:52:15.100 --> 02:52:18.780]  you know sculpture that she might not be sure that's what i'm saying yeah because we thought
[02:52:18.780 --> 02:52:22.540]  about putting out the nfts but they were all original only like a hundred of them and each
[02:52:22.540 --> 02:52:27.420]  was an original piece of art i did yeah and then i saw the market going crazy even before it crashed
[02:52:27.420 --> 02:52:30.620]  i said no i'm gonna wait till later because i because all people would say hey this is original
[02:52:30.620 --> 02:52:34.780]  Alex Jones art here's the nft digital but here's also the physical so we're gonna have all our
[02:52:34.780 --> 02:52:40.940]  stuff be physical and then a a one-off digital yeah i think that's really smart in any way that you
[02:52:40.940 --> 02:52:46.380]  can create something in the nft world that's unique or has got kind of like uh you know a different
[02:52:46.380 --> 02:52:50.860]  kind of story with it it's going to do much better than just hey let me put out 10 000 pictures of
[02:52:50.860 --> 02:52:56.140]  monkeys and i think people are really you know understanding the full potential of what you can
[02:52:56.140 --> 02:53:01.900]  do with nfts and i think it's going to be big in the next bore on medicine further away but
[02:53:01.900 --> 02:53:05.900]  nft is going to come back for sure absolutely because it could be like a original piece of art
[02:53:05.900 --> 02:53:10.300]  you get for joining the country club and it's a 10-year membership so along with that little
[02:53:10.300 --> 02:53:14.140]  nft you have it's also a membership well this is an added thing let me tell you something we're
[02:53:14.140 --> 02:53:21.100]  doing which is kind of cool um we've been working with a uh some an artist from icp which is internet
[02:53:21.100 --> 02:53:26.060]  computer protocol to do some nfts we're actually going to sell these nfts uh next
[02:53:26.060 --> 02:53:30.940]  later this week uh to help fund getting people down to a protest we're going to do in the Bahamas
[02:53:30.940 --> 02:53:38.860]  at some point and what it is is this generative uh art so it comes with a sign it comes maybe with
[02:53:38.860 --> 02:53:45.020]  a background the signs are literally going to be the signs that we hold at the protest uh so number
[02:53:45.020 --> 02:53:48.860]  one it's a fundraiser and so it's a piece of history it's a piece of history it's going to fund
[02:53:48.860 --> 02:53:52.540]  you know getting people down to the Bahamas to be able to protest because they lost all their money
[02:53:52.540 --> 02:53:56.620]  and this guy that's a great way to get people to go out and protest yeah absolutely so and then
[02:53:56.620 --> 02:54:00.460]  you actually get a physical sign that comes with it too uh i think it's really cool all the stuff
[02:54:00.460 --> 02:54:03.740]  that we're uh you know we're going to be able to see over the next and we got all these different
[02:54:03.740 --> 02:54:07.660]  chains uh as well you know you got cardano and you got a theory that's another reason i didn't get
[02:54:07.660 --> 02:54:11.980]  involved a lot of the offers we had is it seems speculative and then they want us to offer all
[02:54:11.980 --> 02:54:16.780]  the stuff that we had to deliver it i just wasn't up to the amount of volume well you should have
[02:54:16.780 --> 02:54:21.660]  called us we'd help shout out um we well i am about doing one-off art or like things like a
[02:54:21.660 --> 02:54:26.220]  protest or things where it's very real absolutely yeah yeah these real world applications are going
[02:54:26.220 --> 02:54:30.540]  to be the thing that's going to take NFTs from being kind of a joke in meme culture right now
[02:54:31.100 --> 02:54:36.460]  back to reality and like oh yeah this stuff really does have uh you know value digital ownership
[02:54:36.460 --> 02:54:40.700]  be able to track it forever so um you know blockchain is open and you can see everybody
[02:54:40.700 --> 02:54:44.700]  who owned it before and i think it's a really cool concept now i think it's a little too far
[02:54:44.700 --> 02:54:50.380]  like Quentin Tarantino was trying to sell like one specific still from pulp fiction or something
[02:54:50.380 --> 02:54:54.300]  like that and then he turns out he didn't even have the rights to it studio had the rights
[02:54:54.300 --> 02:54:58.860]  it's like i think you'd be carried too far like how much do you really want to own one
[02:54:58.860 --> 02:55:03.180]  moment of a movie i don't know if that's very cool but like if you were able to own a physical
[02:55:03.180 --> 02:55:09.740]  copy of the original film along with an ft like that would be cool absolutely that's just crazy so
[02:55:10.700 --> 02:55:14.140]  what else do you need to do there's so much questions i'm gonna ask but what else are the
[02:55:14.140 --> 02:55:20.380]  listeners now yeah i think that uh you know we're continuing to see the fallout of uh of ft exit
[02:55:21.580 --> 02:55:26.140]  one thing is really interesting is if you look at ftx do you know who dan friedberg is
[02:55:26.140 --> 02:55:31.420]  i remember the name yeah so dan friedberg was the general counsel of ultimate bets and uh this is
[02:55:31.420 --> 02:55:35.500]  a kind of cool story if people don't know i mean it's a terrible story uh but dan friedberg was
[02:55:35.500 --> 02:55:42.060]  also the general counsel for ftx ultimate bets was a 40 million dollar poker scam uh back in the
[02:55:42.060 --> 02:55:48.140]  early 2000s before black friday and he was involved in it and didn't even lose his license to practice
[02:55:48.140 --> 02:55:55.740]  in the state of new york they just redid the whole entire scandal on ftx so if you look at it
[02:55:55.740 --> 02:56:00.220]  one thing dan friedberg did as well as creates architecture and shell companies so creating
[02:56:00.220 --> 02:56:04.060]  the architecture behind ftx where everything's very confusing you don't know where any of the money
[02:56:04.060 --> 02:56:09.660]  is going uh that was one of the hallmarks the poker scam was they created something called god mode
[02:56:09.660 --> 02:56:14.540]  right where you could see the other players cards the people that worked at ultimate bets would call
[02:56:14.540 --> 02:56:19.340]  up some of these professional poker players and say hey come play heads up with me not knowing
[02:56:19.340 --> 02:56:23.180]  they could see the cards and they would just take money from them incredible now that's exactly what
[02:56:23.180 --> 02:56:29.100]  ftx is the old days you get in a real card game blasted yeah absolutely you know wow lords myself
[02:56:29.100 --> 02:56:33.980]  but that's the danger of the nerds now becoming the tyrants because they just feel like it's their
[02:56:33.980 --> 02:56:40.140]  right to do this everybody yeah so but if you look at seeing the cards well alameda research
[02:56:40.140 --> 02:56:44.780]  could see everybody's trades on ftx they saw where their liquidations were they saw so they can
[02:56:44.780 --> 02:56:48.700]  manipulate the market even more absolutely gave them that incredible arrogance yeah absolutely what
[02:56:48.700 --> 02:56:54.940]  finally brought them down uh well what what all ultimate bets are ftx ftx well what brought them
[02:56:54.940 --> 02:57:00.940]  down is uh you know cz dumping the fake ft t token and uh you know getting into it with sam
[02:57:00.940 --> 02:57:05.340]  sam and cz have been going at it for months uh you know kind of behind the scenes uh but there
[02:57:05.340 --> 02:57:10.940]  was a whistleblower who actually gave a bunch of information uh to cz and a coin desk about a
[02:57:10.940 --> 02:57:14.940]  potential insolvency uh and that's really what happened if you really want to get technical
[02:57:14.940 --> 02:57:19.100]  what kicked all this off and started this was uh we sent our bill which we were going to find
[02:57:19.100 --> 02:57:23.900]  out later this month to ftx for funding because you know we need oh you hold on do five more
[02:57:23.900 --> 02:57:29.260]  minutes with us you were behind all i know is when is sam bankman free gonna get arrested well
[02:57:29.260 --> 02:57:33.660]  hopefully when we go down to protest in bahamas if people in bahamas will at least arrest him but
[02:57:33.660 --> 02:57:39.900]  i think you're gonna see him arrested uh you know probably by the end of january or uh february i
[02:57:39.900 --> 02:57:44.700]  believe what's going on here on screen that's my guy linkin bayne uh oh let's go right back

[02:58:55.660 --> 02:59:02.060]  many cases in the winter because of something called vapors they associated these poisonous
[02:59:02.060 --> 02:59:08.460]  vapors with cold weather of course it wasn't the cold weather or catching a chill that killed people
[02:59:08.460 --> 02:59:16.540]  what was killing people was a lack of vitamin d3 you see the sun via your skin helps your body
[02:59:16.540 --> 02:59:22.780]  produce vitamin d3 but if you're not getting enough sun you will not produce vitamin d3 and then
[02:59:22.780 --> 02:59:27.260]  it's very easy for viruses and other things you start replicating and taking your body over
[02:59:27.260 --> 02:59:31.980]  so now it's more important than ever because the winter is here to take high quality vitamin d3

[03:00:00.060 --> 03:00:03.980]  so bit boy's here final segment the drill select is coming up everything a few calls next segment
[03:00:03.980 --> 03:00:08.460]  had a few other news items we have sb at was he's known you you were predicting during the break
[03:00:08.460 --> 03:00:13.420]  and on air he's gonna get arrested um and then we were making some other points when he slammed
[03:00:13.420 --> 03:00:18.060]  that right yeah well what i was saying is is uh our bill that comes out at the end of this month
[03:00:18.060 --> 03:00:22.700]  hopefully uh i don't know the exact time we're registered and funded and stuff like that uh
[03:00:22.700 --> 03:00:28.860]  we sent that to ftx for potential funding when we were trying to raise money and that bill getting
[03:00:28.860 --> 03:00:35.820]  sent to their policy department we believe after i've talked to the whistleblower uh is what actually
[03:00:35.820 --> 03:00:42.540]  led to this all coming out because the what sam wanted to do is create a federal bit license that
[03:00:42.540 --> 03:00:46.860]  was what he was doing he tried to steal one of our politicians uh the backs our bill from us
[03:00:46.860 --> 03:00:51.260]  and it became personal between me and him and what happened is he rushed to try to create a
[03:00:51.260 --> 03:00:57.500]  centralized regulation with the dcc pa in the senate and there were people there that did not
[03:00:57.500 --> 03:01:01.500]  like what he was doing there because they like crypto they like decentralization it would be
[03:01:01.500 --> 03:01:05.420]  the end of decentralization and peer-to-peer uh transactions he was trying to become the master
[03:01:05.420 --> 03:01:08.700]  of it all oh absolutely that's what he'd been positioning the entire time and when you look at
[03:01:08.700 --> 03:01:13.180]  the the political donations and the russian money laundering or a ukrainian money laundering
[03:01:13.180 --> 03:01:18.220]  it's a whole other subject what you find is they built this infrastructure to be able to control
[03:01:18.220 --> 03:01:23.420]  politics in america really for as long as they wanted to um but it blew up overnight thankfully
[03:01:23.420 --> 03:01:30.460]  and um so the democrat party's little secret piggyback just got liquidated yeah that's a good
[03:01:30.460 --> 03:01:34.140]  way to look at it of course they were giving money to republicans as well you know anti-trump
[03:01:34.140 --> 03:01:38.460]  republicans uh for the most part but i think when you look at that system yeah that's what
[03:01:38.460 --> 03:01:43.900]  they wanted to do anything that would keep sam and power over regulation is what he wanted
[03:01:43.900 --> 03:01:48.300]  where what we're trying to do in regulation is create a space where you know crypto has a
[03:01:48.300 --> 03:01:51.740]  seat at the table and can determine its own future at least to some extent so we're and
[03:01:51.740 --> 03:01:56.060]  what is this what is we're seeing on screen that is that's me at deltac bank actually uh that is
[03:01:56.060 --> 03:02:00.700]  deltac bank uh the banky partner of tether uh they would not come out and talk to us uh we wanted
[03:02:00.700 --> 03:02:07.180]  some answers and so we put on a twitter spaces and uh eventually uh we walked to the other uh the old
[03:02:07.180 --> 03:02:11.420]  bank and actually took a picture with the vault there um but someone came and talked to us and
[03:02:11.420 --> 03:02:15.900]  they're supposed to still be answering questions for us uh you know sometime soon so i don't know
[03:02:15.900 --> 03:02:19.180]  maybe maybe uh the people of the bank will see me uh you know a little sooner they and where is
[03:02:19.180 --> 03:02:25.100]  this the bahamas yeah that is in the bahamas yeah that that's very close to uh the albany and uh
[03:02:25.100 --> 03:02:29.900]  island brothers was a restaurant where a lot of people from ftx and we didn't get into caroline
[03:02:29.900 --> 03:02:34.780]  and some of those other crazy people that worked there at uh ftx so are that real beauty uh well
[03:02:34.780 --> 03:02:39.260]  you know i don't want to say nothing about her i got a wife you know but yeah she's not she's not
[03:02:39.260 --> 03:02:43.820]  real beauty she's in new york she's flipping by the way uh almost guaranteed she did the queen of
[03:02:43.820 --> 03:02:48.220]  the day tour where she went out and took pictures publicly so people know that she's in new york
[03:02:48.220 --> 03:02:53.420]  that was a message to sam hey i'm flipping because sam has been trying to throw her under the bus
[03:02:53.420 --> 03:02:58.860]  saying well alameda you know they did everything it wasn't us it wasn't us at ftx we had no idea
[03:02:58.860 --> 03:03:03.180]  what was going on with the company that i owe 90 percent of uh so you know definitely a lot of
[03:03:03.180 --> 03:03:06.220]  interesting and his new york times interview is just pathetic and the other ones will almost

[03:06:53.340 --> 03:06:57.580]  producers in the country the fact that most of the stuff we were already getting was supplied by them
[03:06:57.580 --> 03:07:02.300]  but then we had it put together by a third party we've broken through the supply chain and gotten

[03:07:36.540 --> 03:07:41.900]  highest rated super greens out there this company puts all these out nationwide stores many of these
[03:07:41.900 --> 03:07:46.300]  are bestsellers but they're letting us private label it and bring it right to you cutting out the
[03:07:46.300 --> 03:07:51.500]  middleman you get a big discount on that so the new line we still haven't for his life it's still
[03:07:51.500 --> 03:07:55.820]  excellent we'll still have it but most of the things that we have in force life is already from
[03:07:55.820 --> 03:08:00.860]  this company we just cut off the middleman so i'm very very excited we have a lot of proprietary
[03:08:00.860 --> 03:08:04.940]  stuff like x2 x3 that nobody else has got we've got things like d&e force plus that'll still be in
[03:08:04.940 --> 03:08:11.180]  force life we'll still have in force life but this info wars md is amazing and what's going to sell
[03:08:11.180 --> 03:08:20.140]  out they've got plenty of all of it except the tumoric 95 is going to sell out soon and the cbd's
[03:08:20.140 --> 03:08:27.260]  no thc doesn't get high but really strong wide spectrum concentrated cbd from high quality hemp

[03:08:34.700 --> 03:08:43.580]  this is a high-end cbd in 1000 milligram 25 milligram and 10 milligram now again i suggest
[03:08:43.580 --> 03:08:50.220]  you get 10 or 25 milligram at first the thousand is super strong and we're selling it the similar
[03:08:50.220 --> 03:08:56.460]  types or the very same type routinely retail for 140 bucks they discount for 100 we've got it for
[03:08:56.460 --> 03:09:02.140]  less than 80 dollars and of course it's only like 30 or 40 bucks for the 10 milligrams and the 25
[03:09:02.140 --> 03:09:07.900]  milligrams so so it's all there i personally get the same response up to 25 milligram because i get
[03:09:07.900 --> 03:09:12.460]  off a thousand but if you want the really strong stuff we've got it as good as it gets that's going
[03:09:12.460 --> 03:09:19.420]  to sell out soon so get it all at infowarstore.com or triple at triple eight two five three three
[03:09:19.420 --> 03:09:25.500]  one three nine i was about to read libido rx and a 40 and slip so triple eight two five three three

[03:12:30.060 --> 03:12:35.180]  but there's you have to do it you have to teach these kids to be prepared for what's coming in the
[03:12:35.180 --> 03:12:41.260]  future um my daughter is a straight a student athlete raises cattle and she put her foot down
[03:12:41.260 --> 03:12:46.060]  in high school about not being vaccinated about not being tested three days a week and they left

[03:12:56.060 --> 03:13:00.060]  believe in that why don't we raise money for the kids that don't have shoes here why don't we raise money
[03:13:00.060 --> 03:13:04.140]  for our fire department that's closed there's kids out there they're putting their feet down

[03:13:38.780 --> 03:13:44.860]  hi i just wanted to say i've been listening to you for 20 years uh first time caller with you i
[03:13:44.860 --> 03:13:51.500]  talked to olyn before i appreciate you having me on yes sir and i just wanted to call in and talk
[03:13:51.500 --> 03:13:58.620]  about the elon thing i have an angle i would like to get your thoughts on right now i believe we're
[03:13:58.620 --> 03:14:05.260]  seeing a war for control of the planet between traditional nationalist tyranny and globalist
[03:14:05.260 --> 03:14:11.260]  tyranny and i feel like elon is hedging his bets with the people and nationalism and the populist
[03:14:11.260 --> 03:14:17.980]  movement and marketing himself to be against tyranny when he and his colleagues colleagues have their
[03:14:17.980 --> 03:14:24.940]  own vision for us to live in a dystopian ai controlled society an ai controlled society where
[03:14:24.940 --> 03:14:32.540]  we have the illusion of national sovereignty as opposed to a lockdown style global government
[03:14:32.540 --> 03:14:39.500]  in an actual society that's linked to ai hive minds that elon wants to link us with with
[03:14:39.500 --> 03:14:43.420]  neurolink and his satellites and i kind of wanted your thoughts on that i mean i 100
[03:14:43.420 --> 03:14:48.780]  agree with what you just said all his actions are he's a competing neural order force he knows
[03:14:48.780 --> 03:14:53.420]  freedom is popular so until he gets in full power he's going to advertise he's for freedom
[03:14:53.420 --> 03:15:00.300]  he's going to knock out his existing foes i agree with you and you know for for callers you know
[03:15:00.300 --> 03:15:05.580]  conservative you know allies and libertarian allies out there that support him i just want
[03:15:05.580 --> 03:15:10.940]  people to keep in mind he has the infrastructure in place with satellites he owns one of the largest
[03:15:10.940 --> 03:15:17.900]  social media platforms on the planet he wants to be like we chat in china so your payments your
[03:15:17.900 --> 03:15:24.140]  shopping everything is done through it and this could also be used to usher in a social credit
[03:15:24.140 --> 03:15:28.620]  score here in the united states absolutely and the other tech companies went with china so i think
[03:15:28.620 --> 03:15:33.580]  part of our deep state that's not totally pro china is behind him very powerful andrew thank you

[03:15:46.860 --> 03:15:51.740]  jerry solente takes over right now thank you so much for tuning in folks jerry solente straight ahead
[03:15:57.020 --> 03:16:02.460]  so when i first started taking survival skill basically i was 275 pounds i was overweight i had
[03:16:02.460 --> 03:16:07.740]  brain fog like you wouldn't believe i was barely holding on to a job and i heard dr group on your
[03:16:07.740 --> 03:16:12.460]  show and i listened to it so the first one i got was the original survival shield the x1 and it
[03:16:12.460 --> 03:16:16.300]  worked pretty good and then shortly thereafter you came out with that stew you had you know with a
[03:16:16.300 --> 03:16:20.940]  deeper source you know and i got really excited about that so i took it and man in two weeks i
[03:16:20.940 --> 03:16:27.180]  went from brain fog to like literally like my brain was enlightened you know i could think again i
[03:16:27.180 --> 03:16:32.700]  could connect with people again and over the course of the next couple of years i got my health back
[03:16:32.700 --> 03:16:37.260]  kind of religiously take basically all of your supplements they're they're all absolutely amazing
[03:16:37.260 --> 03:16:41.660]  supplements the one i like recently is knockout literally like if you want to sleep just take
[03:16:41.660 --> 03:16:46.460]  it it's amazing it works but anyway so the point is we have to get ourselves clean that's a break
[03:16:46.460 --> 03:16:51.340]  free of the globalist system and the only way to do that is to take our own health into our own

[03:52:26.940 --> 03:52:33.820]  to bring this word to a conclusion of course we are providing considerable help to Ukraine
[03:52:34.540 --> 03:52:36.860]  both militarily and economic
[03:52:39.340 --> 03:52:46.620]  oh militarily and economic you're stealing our money to give to the military industrial complex
[03:52:49.580 --> 03:52:56.460]  and it's not my business this war it's been going on between Ukraine and Russia for over 300 years
[03:52:56.460 --> 03:53:02.140]  they're taking down a statue of Catherine the great because she created Odessa and they don't like
[03:53:02.140 --> 03:53:07.580]  her and he made it Ukrainian and you're telling me I should be involved in this
[03:53:11.980 --> 03:53:19.900]  America goes not abroad in search of monsters to destroy to John Quincy Adams

[03:53:28.780 --> 03:53:35.020]  keep stealing mine and by the way with the year ending and you got to pay all these taxes to
[03:53:35.020 --> 03:53:39.500]  give to the war machine you know you get a cut in your taxes when you donate
[03:53:42.140 --> 03:53:48.300]  to a nonprofit so you might want to donate rather than paying taxes to
[03:53:48.300 --> 03:53:57.740]  to freedompeacejustice.com freedompeacejustice.com or occupypeace.com so going back to the war
[03:53:57.740 --> 03:54:03.180]  mongering Yellen how dare she say this
[03:54:08.380 --> 03:54:14.780]  then you got this other little arrogant boy a little clown of arrogant nothing
[03:54:14.780 --> 03:54:23.180]  Stoltenberg who's the head of the NATO the secretary general secretary general
[03:54:23.180 --> 03:54:30.140]  his secretary is on my lap of his secretary general piece of crap I hate these titles
[03:54:30.140 --> 03:54:38.460]  they give these little clowns so Friday he said I fear that war in Russia will get out of control
[03:54:38.460 --> 03:54:46.620]  and spread into major war between NATO and Russia tada as we've been saying with the cover your
[03:54:46.620 --> 03:54:55.660]  trends journal two days before Russia invaded COVID war Ukraine war world war got it maniacs are

[03:55:29.340 --> 03:55:37.180]  again in your trends journals right there he said that both the U.S. and NATO quote are directly
[03:55:37.180 --> 03:55:47.420]  participating end quote in the war in Ukraine meaning that Russia has the pretext with strikes on
[03:55:47.420 --> 03:55:59.500]  NATO if NATO keeps sending them money and weaponry and intelligence and training we're at war it's

[03:56:33.500 --> 03:56:41.900]  to deter Russia is strengthening alliance position in eastern europe Stoltenberg said Russia's
[03:56:41.900 --> 03:56:49.580]  president Vladimir Putin quote quote knows it's one for all and all for one
[03:56:53.340 --> 03:56:59.500]  and now the new york times reported that washington has given Ukraine
[03:56:59.500 --> 03:57:06.380]  a tacit endorsement to launch attacks inside russia
