[00:00.000 --> 00:11.760]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.760 --> 00:19.320]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.320 --> 00:27.240]  Texas Alex Jones we've got Bob Chapman joining us coming up in an hour and a
[00:27.240 --> 00:32.520]  half breakdown what's happening in the world economy from the international
[00:32.520 --> 00:37.920]  forecaster then we have Dr. Paul Craig Roberts coming up in the fourth hour
[00:37.920 --> 00:43.840]  today after Mr. Chapman leaves us a course former editor at the Wall Street
[00:43.840 --> 00:47.720]  Journal former head of policy department of the Treasury father of
[00:47.720 --> 00:52.120]  Reaganomics a true conservative he'll be joining us to go over basically what
[00:52.120 --> 00:56.960]  we're facing as a society and where he sees the economy going as well and what
[00:56.960 --> 01:04.720]  this big January surprise is that Biden and Powell and prime ministers and
[01:04.720 --> 01:08.000]  presidents around the world are saying they all know about but we don't know
[01:08.000 --> 01:13.760]  about Bob Chapman says he thinks that he's got intel and he was of course in
[01:13.760 --> 01:17.640]  military intel before he was the largest gold silverbroker in the United
[01:17.640 --> 01:24.960]  States that he knows what the big surprise is specifically and so we'll be
[01:24.960 --> 01:31.840]  talking about that with him coming up as I said an hour and a half I have been
[01:31.840 --> 01:40.160]  aware of Rahm Emanuel for well since 1995 when I really got informed started
[01:40.160 --> 01:46.120]  getting informed I was politically active in college and I would say more
[01:46.120 --> 01:49.160]  informed than say the average Joe but I was still kind of in the left-right
[01:49.160 --> 01:56.720]  paradigm kind of like a mainline Ron Paul supporter and early on I learned who
[01:56.720 --> 02:03.040]  the enemy of the Republic was a great enemy a kind of a new type you know a
[02:03.040 --> 02:08.200]  new generation of a George Schultz super gopher for the New World Order or a
[02:08.200 --> 02:14.800]  Henry Kissinger or as a big new Brazilian that's Rahm Emanuel he is a total
[02:14.800 --> 02:19.760]  anti-gunner he wants to ban American zoning firearms basically he spearheaded
[02:19.760 --> 02:24.880]  the assault weapons ban he spearheaded NAFTA and GATT he is the man that gets
[02:24.880 --> 02:32.080]  jobs done and he is sworn to get our guns that's the new chief of staff they're
[02:32.080 --> 02:36.800]  talking about a bunch of other appointments it looks really bad folks
[02:36.800 --> 02:49.600]  and I've you know I don't want to be associated with the really just mindless
[02:49.600 --> 02:56.680]  hateful and by hateful a lot of them have attacked me and made stuff up or
[02:56.680 --> 03:01.240]  exaggerated or twisted things I've said and they all fight with each other and
[03:01.240 --> 03:06.200]  so that's a distasteful group as well but at the same time I'm in a you I'm a
[03:06.200 --> 03:10.600]  USA first guy and a second amendment guy number one and a first amendment guy I
[03:10.600 --> 03:15.760]  mean that comes first for me and I just got to say it I mean it was one thing
[03:15.760 --> 03:20.320]  with the last administration and I was hoping it was a fluke and was gonna stop
[03:20.320 --> 03:27.800]  but I mean come on folks every key person in the Bush administration and now in
[03:27.800 --> 03:33.920]  this next administration just so happened to be the sons and daughters of the
[03:33.920 --> 03:38.160]  founders of Israel and massage chiefs and people and they're openly not even
[03:38.160 --> 03:45.120]  really US citizens and they openly are at the head of the table in anti-gun
[03:45.120 --> 03:49.480]  operations in the US and I'm sick of it I mean Rahm Emanuel has been in the
[03:49.480 --> 03:56.040]  Israeli military he gets up on news and says he's Israel first and I've had
[03:56.040 --> 04:00.640]  enough of it I mean I have really getting sick of it I am really getting
[04:00.640 --> 04:05.040]  tired of it now I'm against Schwarzenegger being a foreigner and he's over
[04:05.040 --> 04:09.920]  here anti-gun and he also wants all these carbon taxes and the rest of it so
[04:09.920 --> 04:14.320]  you know it's the same thing I'm sick of but but we don't have you know
[04:14.320 --> 04:23.080]  Austrians in every you know major power position British Intel's deeply
[04:23.080 --> 04:29.040]  infiltrated and got their people everywhere too and that's bad but I mean
[04:29.040 --> 04:36.600]  I just can't take it anymore folks I just can't take it anymore I mean Israel
[04:36.600 --> 04:40.080]  gets all this money from the US to buy their citizens M16 which is fine with
[04:40.080 --> 04:44.360]  me I'm all for citizens any anywhere being armed but then I can't have my
[04:44.360 --> 04:52.160]  guns I mean everything the United States has done for Israel and then we have to
[04:52.160 --> 04:56.440]  turn our guns in because Israel says so so we can be good little slaves to the
[04:56.440 --> 05:03.840]  new world order help us hello friends this is Alex Jones I've told you for a
[05:03.840 --> 05:06.960]  long time it's important to be self-sufficient and today that's more
[05:06.960 --> 05:10.440]  important than ever we need to be independent and food and water is the
[05:10.440 --> 05:14.040]  key you'll never have to stand in a red line if you have your own bread you'll
[05:14.040 --> 05:17.720]  never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in
[05:17.720 --> 05:21.700]  any emergency if you simply prepare our elected representatives wanted a good
[05:21.700 --> 05:25.480]  old boy bailout for the special interest so they ignored your screams not to do
[05:25.480 --> 05:29.000]  it they turned off the telephones and email they voted to print eight hundred
[05:29.000 --> 05:32.800]  and fifty billion dollars at least out of thin air this money now owns the
[05:32.800 --> 05:36.600]  American and European banks the exploding inflation that is now guaranteed
[05:36.600 --> 05:40.360]  will slash your life savings to nothing and blast the cost of assassins
[05:40.360 --> 05:45.000]  particularly food beyond many Americans reach in pre-Nazi Germany super
[05:45.000 --> 05:48.800]  inflation the cost of a loaf of bread doubled every two days until it reached
[05:48.800 --> 05:53.560]  over four billion marks food prices are skyrocketing so fast there seems as if
[05:53.560 --> 05:57.520]  there may be no end in sight the private banks merging with our government are
[05:57.520 --> 06:00.880]  refusing to loan grocery stores enough money to restock their shelves the
[06:00.880 --> 06:04.960]  stores have less food but jack up prices to stay in business whatever happens in
[06:04.960 --> 06:08.920]  America we need to be prepared and be ready everything is zeroing in on food
[06:08.920 --> 06:12.360]  one third of Americans have to choose between buying food and paying for other
[06:12.360 --> 06:16.880]  necessities my friends whatever it takes get prepared get self-sufficient get
[06:16.880 --> 06:20.160]  food for everybody out there listening it's very important for you to understand
[06:20.160 --> 06:23.440]  that by having a supply of storable food the government the new old order has a
[06:23.440 --> 06:27.240]  lot less control over you and so it's a mindset a mindset of self-sufficiency
[06:27.240 --> 06:31.000]  and preparedness no one is going to take care of your family in the final
[06:31.000 --> 06:34.400]  equation but you you know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship

[07:07.360 --> 07:11.560]  storable food the Genesis Communications radio network proudly
[07:11.560 --> 07:18.440]  presents the Alex Jones show because there's a war on for your mind
[07:18.440 --> 07:29.200]  there have been prominent PhD historical scholars scores of them last few
[07:29.200 --> 07:35.080]  years we've gotten a lot of attention writing books and articles and white
[07:35.080 --> 07:44.240]  papers about the undue influence that Israel has over United States politics
[07:44.240 --> 07:50.000]  on both the left and the right one of the most powerful lobbies you also have
[07:50.000 --> 07:57.880]  the oil lobby and the defense lobby and the banking lobby but Israel is key at
[07:57.880 --> 08:04.960]  the heart of or at least in large sectors of those groups as well and I've
[08:04.960 --> 08:08.160]  made films about it and I've made a film about the USS Liberty and its
[08:08.160 --> 08:11.400]  entire storm and we've had a lot of guests on and have covered it we haven't
[08:11.400 --> 08:14.760]  made it our only issue the only thing we've talked about and so we've been
[08:14.760 --> 08:21.720]  criticized for that but criticism never affects my stance on things I always go
[08:21.720 --> 08:25.280]  with what I believe is right and to cover the information that I believe is
[08:25.280 --> 08:33.880]  the most accurate and unfortunately a lot of the people criticizing Israel do
[08:33.880 --> 08:40.600]  it in such an unsavory childlike manner that it really aids a lot of the
[08:40.600 --> 08:44.320]  corruption we see coming out of Israel and undue influence over our political
[08:44.320 --> 08:49.680]  process and that's why going back to the 20s there are a lot of documents books
[08:49.680 --> 08:55.240]  have been written on this by major professors a lot of them Jewish you know
[08:55.240 --> 09:01.160]  Zionist handbooks about go out stir up anti-Semitism get people to attack the
[09:01.160 --> 09:08.320]  general Jewish public so that they will then support what the intergroup is
[09:08.320 --> 09:16.800]  doing you know to quote get our people on in line as they say they say get up to
[09:16.800 --> 09:21.160]  get our people in line we need to go out and stir up and foster and support
[09:21.160 --> 09:26.600]  anti-Semitism and then that actually compacts the group more psychologically
[09:26.600 --> 09:31.800]  gets more people who are you know not involved in the larger criminal syndicate
[09:31.800 --> 09:36.480]  how to go along with what's happening and and and every major nation every major
[09:36.480 --> 09:40.960]  group throughout history organizes itself along what you could call organized
[09:40.960 --> 09:45.640]  crime lines the British Empire the US Empire the German Empire the French
[09:45.640 --> 09:52.200]  Empire the Dutch Empire I mean we're just stating the way systems operate and
[09:52.200 --> 09:57.040]  generally most empires have been racially based or religiously based
[09:57.040 --> 10:01.360]  you know the Roman Empire was about Romans not even so much people from
[10:01.360 --> 10:07.680]  Italy what is Italy today but the Roman city state itself and most people who
[10:07.680 --> 10:14.160]  lived in Italy even if they were of the same bloodlines as the Roman
[10:14.160 --> 10:17.800]  aristocracy they were still slaves and later they were all made Roman citizens
[10:17.800 --> 10:22.440]  and then the Gauls and the Germans and others were made Roman citizens then
[10:22.440 --> 10:27.360]  Rome collapsed so that's how things are based and you know from a historical
[10:27.360 --> 10:32.120]  view and from a anthropology view I understand it and I see it for what it
[10:32.120 --> 10:43.520]  is but I'm not gonna you know it's one thing to have powerful elements of the
[10:43.520 --> 10:50.960]  Israeli lobby all over the Bush administration and to have them being
[10:50.960 --> 10:54.080]  you know some of the most energetic cheerleaders for the Patriot Act and
[10:54.080 --> 11:00.440]  torture and police state measures and warrantless spying that's bad but to now
[11:00.440 --> 11:04.600]  have a Rahm Emanuel whose father was one of the head terrorists that founded
[11:04.600 --> 11:08.200]  Israel and Rahm Emanuel himself is in the Israeli military Israeli
[11:08.200 --> 11:15.140]  intelligence dual citizen I mean I'd be against having the chief of staff be
[11:15.140 --> 11:20.000]  British and openly have worked for the British government I would be against
[11:20.000 --> 11:23.160]  Arnold Schwarzenegger being in this cabinet which they're talking about
[11:23.160 --> 11:34.480]  doing it's bad on its face it's wrong on its face it snakes to high heaven and in
[11:34.480 --> 11:38.560]  horizon the Jerusalem post in the agency French press these are the
[11:38.560 --> 11:42.520]  headlines Obama's choice for chief of staff puts Israel's man in the White
[11:42.520 --> 11:47.200]  House and that's the headline in Israel you know we run the White House we've
[11:47.200 --> 11:50.880]  got the White House I mean but then as an American citizen I'm not supposed to
[11:50.880 --> 11:57.320]  mention that I'm supposed to just sit down and shut up and go along with that
[11:57.320 --> 12:04.840]  now that insulted injury here I mean do you need to have questionable birth
[12:04.840 --> 12:11.200]  questionable birth or you know have your lineage in this country be about a
[12:11.200 --> 12:14.840]  centimeter deep like Obama to be president now do you have to not be
[12:14.840 --> 12:19.400]  born here and say that you want to be a Hitler dictator to be a governor do you
[12:19.400 --> 12:23.840]  have to be an open you know Mossad officer like chair it off for Mukaisi or
[12:23.840 --> 12:29.880]  Rahm Emanuel I mean do you have to be a foreigner to run our government I mean
[12:29.880 --> 12:33.160]  it's not enough that is Israeli government runs the company that does
[12:33.160 --> 12:37.240]  98% of caller ID and phone tracking in the nation that's been mainstream news
[12:37.240 --> 12:41.200]  is it not enough that Israel has the sole contract quote guard the nuclear
[12:41.200 --> 12:46.320]  weapons our own government doesn't even have control of them is it not enough
[12:46.320 --> 12:59.200]  that Israel had fingerprints all over 9-11 is it not enough that all of this
[12:59.200 --> 13:02.520]  is going on but this guy is Rahm Emanuel and a bunch of other people are
[13:02.520 --> 13:07.320]  talking about a pointing now is the anti-gunner I mean he's on record saying
[13:07.320 --> 13:11.680]  ban basically all rifles ban assault weapons make you turn in semi-automatic
[13:11.680 --> 13:20.000]  rifles handguns ban 308 ban 223 ban 50 cal register all American gun owners
[13:20.000 --> 13:25.240]  handgun control incorporated says their plan is the abolition of a private
[13:25.240 --> 13:29.860]  ownership of guns they said that an article what 1999 attacking me in the
[13:29.860 --> 13:32.960]  statesman they said well don't worry we've got your kids they've been bragged
[13:32.960 --> 13:39.840]  in a local paper they said we have your children in the schools and let me tell
[13:39.840 --> 13:45.480]  you something I take great offense and Rahm Emanuel and the Israeli lobby
[13:45.480 --> 13:51.840]  coming in here and basically running the gun control lobby in this country that's
[13:51.840 --> 13:56.200]  very dangerous ladies and gentlemen to have any foreign nation moving in and
[13:56.200 --> 14:01.160]  taking over the intelligence operations of this criminal government and openly
[14:01.160 --> 14:09.640]  pushing gun control and that crosses the line that crosses the line and I have to
[14:09.640 --> 14:14.080]  be very careful how I approach this though because I am not going to feed in
[14:14.080 --> 14:22.920]  to tribalism I am not going to because because if you approach this and do it
[14:22.920 --> 14:28.800]  in a nasty way it actually empowers all of this race politics and religious
[14:28.800 --> 14:32.160]  stuff and I'm not going to do it I'm just going to state the facts and that's
[14:32.160 --> 14:36.520]  what we put out about six seven articles by Kurt Nemo and Paul Watson and Steve
[14:36.520 --> 14:41.800]  Watson in the last 48 hours exposing all of this and we're going to do more of it
[14:44.360 --> 14:50.280]  as if everything else I do isn't dangerous enough I just the Republic
[14:50.280 --> 14:54.600]  comes first and the second amendment comes first it comes above my life and
[14:54.600 --> 15:01.360]  my name and my reputation it comes first and Rahm Emanuel is also wanting the
[15:01.360 --> 15:04.720]  violent radicalization act passed he's the guy trying to pass hate laws which
[15:04.720 --> 15:08.400]  restrict free speech in America it isn't enough to come after the second
[15:08.400 --> 15:15.120]  amendment to disarm us to be good little slaves little compliant slaves as far
[15:15.120 --> 15:22.480]  in domination of our government is wanted in our face but now our first
[15:22.480 --> 15:26.840]  amendment has to go and the same groups are at the forefront pushing
[15:26.840 --> 15:31.120]  censoring the web Lieberman and everybody else and censoring free speech
[15:31.120 --> 15:38.680]  and federally he wants a domestic in my five with a myth he is he's the author
[15:38.680 --> 15:42.560]  of go back to Clinton but all started with a secure core part of America or
[15:42.560 --> 15:47.640]  it's Rahm Emanuel who wants the million stasi tattle brigade I mean he wants to
[15:47.640 --> 15:52.600]  restrict free speech openly he wants to ban your guns openly he wants a
[15:52.600 --> 15:56.880]  million person tattletale squad openly and he is a foreign intelligence
[15:56.880 --> 16:01.400]  operative of a foreign nation I mean is the humiliation of this country get any
[16:01.400 --> 16:12.240]  worse could it be any deeper could it be any more humiliating he also in his
[16:12.240 --> 16:17.920]  congressional run has gotten more Wall Street money than any other person
[16:17.920 --> 16:27.360]  running for Congress in history this is just one of these people and so we see
[16:27.360 --> 16:34.360]  moving in the defense lobby the banking lobby and the Israeli lobby more than
[16:34.360 --> 16:43.280]  ever more than ever the executive branch is nothing but a nozzle to suck up the
[16:43.280 --> 16:48.200]  wealth and the treasury of this country and offshore it the Congress is
[16:48.200 --> 16:53.120]  completely ceremonial and until we started meeting the Congress has handed
[16:53.120 --> 16:57.040]  over its authority was threatened with martial law when they were getting a
[16:57.040 --> 17:00.160]  thousand to one phone calls against the bank or takeover bill and they did it
[17:00.160 --> 17:02.920]  because they know their threat with martial law they're threatened with the
[17:02.920 --> 17:08.680]  media destroying them they are ceremonial they have been cowed they are
[17:08.680 --> 17:12.320]  afraid because they know they'll be killed they'll be set up they'll be
[17:12.320 --> 17:20.360]  destroyed they know that this country is now under total darkness this nation is
[17:20.360 --> 17:29.240]  now completely and totally under international crime syndicate control a
[17:29.240 --> 17:33.720]  consortium of wicked robber barons black nobility that is the old royal
[17:33.720 --> 17:35.760]  families of Europe
[17:35.760 --> 17:43.000]  intermarried and interbred with the Rothschilds and the Rockefellers I mean
[17:43.000 --> 17:47.400]  go read the newspapers it's all admitted right there they don't even hide that
[17:47.400 --> 17:53.400]  stuff and so if agency French press and Jerusalem Post can run headlines with
[17:53.400 --> 17:56.720]  that Israel's man in the White House and go read if yourself up on info wars

[24:34.040 --> 24:37.480]  know yesterday said they've never had cells like this David Nelson a co-owner
[24:37.480 --> 24:41.000]  of Montana ordinance and supply in Missoula Montana said his buyers were
[24:41.000 --> 24:45.160]  awake and aware to see a dangerous trend and by the way this isn't Russia in
[24:45.160 --> 24:49.200]  the Bolsheviks you're not getting the guns you understand but you can't help
[24:49.200 --> 24:54.080]  it you're gonna go ahead and push and I just feel sorry for all the man before
[24:54.080 --> 24:59.520]  I go any further I watched News 8 Austin for 40 minutes this morning on the
[24:59.520 --> 25:08.000]  treadmill at home and it was all brainwashing of the children they had
[25:08.000 --> 25:15.200]  some Mexican mafia trying to rob some store and one of them shot at the cops
[25:15.200 --> 25:19.720]  and they killed him that's good I'm all for them defending themselves and then
[25:19.720 --> 25:22.360]  the two go to them ran off and then they'd already caught them but they
[25:22.360 --> 25:27.640]  still had this big lockdown of eight schools and told the schools they're in
[25:27.640 --> 25:31.520]  your school just lying and all day then they had SWAT teams and they've
[25:31.520 --> 25:35.280]  they've boosted the paramilitary police in Austin from dozens to hundreds
[25:35.280 --> 25:39.040]  running around in military outfits training us to be locked down and be
[25:39.040 --> 25:42.240]  slaves so I watched that and the children and the parents going yeah we were
[25:42.240 --> 25:45.160]  told they were in the school we were told and robots driving around the
[25:45.160 --> 25:48.920]  schools all part of brainwashing the children to go under martial law any
[25:48.920 --> 25:55.200]  excuse to do that and then the next thing was about oh how they take the
[25:55.200 --> 25:59.520]  brownies the girl scouts in and brainwashing about global warming and
[25:59.520 --> 26:05.520]  the climate it's just everything's brainwashing everything is brainwashing
[26:05.520 --> 26:11.520]  and I'm I just I really blew up yesterday and I've gotten better and better
[26:11.520 --> 26:15.280]  about not getting into a really negative nasty mood but I mean I felt nasty I
[26:15.280 --> 26:21.200]  felt you know when you just felt dirty you feel vomitous you feel just not even
[26:21.200 --> 26:26.000]  angry it's more just sick because I can't believe what's happening to our
[26:26.000 --> 26:34.720]  beautiful Republic and I can't believe just how pervasive the propaganda is
[26:36.920 --> 26:41.760]  and on the environmental front there are thousands of horrible environmental
[26:41.760 --> 26:44.920]  things happening being done by big industry and biotech and companies and
[26:44.920 --> 26:50.080]  GMO foods and GMO crops killing the honeybees and everything else none of
[26:50.080 --> 26:52.920]  that's being curtailed that's being expanded none of it's even being
[26:52.920 --> 26:59.880]  investigated or looked at and this whole thing about carbon taxes that is
[26:59.880 --> 27:03.400]  openly to be paid to the private foreign banks they openly have announced
[27:03.400 --> 27:06.840]  what was in their documents decades ago they're now openly pushing it's all
[27:06.840 --> 27:11.600]  happening everything you do regulated and tracked and traced the what you

[33:38.680 --> 33:46.320]  the foreign banks and the attack pattern is classically the most vicious and
[33:46.320 --> 33:55.720]  deadly ever seen it is a classic Stasi or NKVD early Russian Revolution mass
[33:55.720 --> 34:02.400]  roundup mass starvation mass extermination attack pattern I'm not
[34:02.400 --> 34:09.520]  kidding now the CIA in 47 when it was founded this is now declassified even

[34:18.720 --> 34:23.000]  World Bank its precursor the International Bank of Settlements the OECD
[34:23.000 --> 34:28.720]  funded them and China implemented all of its policies and exterminated 85

[34:41.640 --> 34:46.120]  openly funded the Bolshevik Revolution and the murder of 60 plus mill in Russia
[34:46.120 --> 34:57.280]  over 30 years now they are setting up the exact same attack pattern here but I do
[34:57.280 --> 35:00.080]  want to tell the SWAT teams and paramilitaries forces that are just
[35:00.080 --> 35:04.160]  swelling all around us and the intelligence groups and all of you the
[35:04.160 --> 35:10.520]  state police intelligence groups all of you the blackwater people all of you this
[35:10.520 --> 35:17.320]  is not going to be like Iraq this this is not going to be as easy as sitting
[35:17.320 --> 35:22.680]  around machine-gunning a family up against a wall and laughing about it this
[35:22.680 --> 35:29.960]  is not going to be as easy as you think it is I'm gonna stay in the United
[35:29.960 --> 35:34.520]  States I come to grips with this every day but I just resigned myself to whatever
[35:34.520 --> 35:38.200]  happens and I'm just gonna tell it all like it is and it's just you know I'm
[35:38.200 --> 35:42.520]  gonna defend the Republic and I'm not going to try to cover my butt and I'm
[35:42.520 --> 35:45.640]  just gonna tell it like it is and I'm telling you we have the most vicious
[35:45.640 --> 35:52.600]  evil people running this country you can imagine they have all these corporate
[35:52.600 --> 35:56.400]  whores that have sold out to them through cowardice and through greed and
[35:56.400 --> 36:02.120]  through arrogance they're coming for your free speech openly they're coming for
[36:02.120 --> 36:05.560]  your guns openly and they're gonna do it all through an economic depression where
[36:05.560 --> 36:08.440]  they say oh well we've got to do all this because of riots and starving and
[36:08.440 --> 36:13.640]  wars and they're gonna start wars with Iran they're gonna start wars with
[36:13.640 --> 36:25.120]  Pakistan they're gonna start wars with Russia God help us just God help us here's
[36:25.120 --> 36:28.480]  the kind of news I have in front of me dims target private retirement council
[36:28.480 --> 36:34.040]  this is out of the Carolina Journal it's up on info wars.com CNBC also had a
[36:34.040 --> 36:38.200]  report yesterday going well yes it's being looked at to go after retirement
[36:38.200 --> 36:45.000]  accounts and go after pension funds and just like Argentina or just like Iceland
[36:45.000 --> 36:50.160]  just like anywhere else where they do it they're calling it protecting them the
[36:50.160 --> 36:55.040]  government is going to take them to protect them they're talking about
[36:55.040 --> 37:00.360]  taking more out of your paycheck and making you invest it in the stock market
[37:00.360 --> 37:08.760]  this carbon taxes they're putting in in California in New York Oregon now they're
[37:08.760 --> 37:15.840]  about to do it federally and everything from plastic bags to fuel to natural gas
[37:15.840 --> 37:20.480]  everything coal you think you think the economy shutting down now what do you
[37:20.480 --> 37:23.720]  think's gonna happen when China and India and Mexico and 160 plus other
[37:23.720 --> 37:29.360]  nations make zero emissions cuts but we have to well our industry will move
[37:29.360 --> 37:32.040]  there and there's international studies showing will actually increase those
[37:32.040 --> 37:35.600]  emissions of by the way things that aren't even bad like carbon dioxide but
[37:35.600 --> 37:38.880]  point is if you're believing it's bad fine then let's have that argument let's
[37:38.880 --> 37:44.280]  say it's bad how was exporting it to China and India who are never going to
[37:44.280 --> 37:48.440]  adopt this and have said they never are it's a tax on us that will further the
[37:48.440 --> 37:56.480]  industrializes increase the emissions but that's what the globalists want to
[37:56.480 --> 37:59.840]  bring down with the western world to bring down any middle class to bring
[37:59.840 --> 38:06.080]  down any sovereign independent group so it's all over the news that they're
[38:06.080 --> 38:13.280]  coming after your pension funds God help us they're just gonna rape us so bad
[38:14.640 --> 38:20.320]  there's all these poor stupid power tripping cops like it's just a sports
[38:20.320 --> 38:26.120]  team like they're the cowboys and the American people are the sea hawks or
[38:26.120 --> 38:31.120]  something and then you know where we're gonna kick our butt all these bubbles
[38:31.120 --> 38:41.840]  hey I work on that year I'm tough I ride a Harley my wife's a topless dancer you
[38:41.840 --> 38:47.000]  have no idea the water you're in I do and I'm completely not even freaked out
[38:47.000 --> 38:52.160]  I'm just completely awake completely alive to the point it's just it's hard
[38:52.160 --> 38:57.280]  to bear I am white knuckle all the time I am totally my brain I'm going a
[38:57.280 --> 39:02.960]  million miles an hour analysis so fast so spot-on I can't even articulate it I
[39:02.960 --> 39:07.160]  can see the full picture and you know what I keep hoping the full picture I
[39:07.160 --> 39:10.440]  saw over a decade ago wasn't accurate from all their documents and all their
[39:10.440 --> 39:14.440]  activities I mean folks when they've been running secret camps for decades they
[39:14.440 --> 39:17.800]  now admit they've been running secretly civilian inmate labor camp just
[39:17.800 --> 39:22.280]  Google it you'll be on the army's website but they could keep a dozen huge camp secret
[39:22.280 --> 39:26.640]  with people in them that they can go on the news and lie and say it's the law to
[39:26.640 --> 39:30.680]  take vaccines when it's not and light up thousands at sports stadiums and parks
[39:30.680 --> 39:35.800]  with police in riot gear with dogs barking that image of them being shot up
[39:35.800 --> 39:39.280]  people crying saying I don't want to take it but it's the law when there's no law
[39:39.280 --> 39:47.200]  when they got 24,000 26,000 preachers excuse me in the last wave under the
[39:47.200 --> 39:51.800]  clergy response teams secretly now it's declassified that's why they're all we
[39:51.800 --> 39:55.000]  got a bunch of videos up of preachers you know given sermons saying do whatever
[39:55.000 --> 39:58.320]  the government says that what's what's coming very bad things are coming it's
[39:58.320 --> 40:02.920]  of the Lord go wherever they say do whatever they want understand they're
[40:02.920 --> 40:10.160]  really going to do it they're really going to do it they're really going to
[40:10.160 --> 40:12.800]  take all your pension funds and all your retirement they really are going to take
[40:12.800 --> 40:20.440]  your house your farm and they're going to send your own family your own family
[40:20.440 --> 40:25.720]  those who live in the countryside it's going to be units it's going to be your
[40:25.720 --> 40:29.200]  own army your own military and they're going to come with American flags flying
[40:29.200 --> 40:32.160]  and you know what you're gonna stand down a lot of you and give them your farm
[40:32.160 --> 40:45.160]  your ranch but if 1% don't if 1% of this adult population doesn't lay down
[40:45.160 --> 40:49.760]  that's 2 million people fighting back a large portion of them that are going to
[40:49.760 --> 40:53.760]  fight back are going to be veterans who just don't care anymore who are tired of
[40:53.760 --> 40:59.280]  all of it who know they have nothing left to lose and that too is part of the
[40:59.280 --> 41:03.560]  plan the shadow government has prepared for decades to push us into a corner to
[41:03.560 --> 41:08.700]  make us fight back to make us wipe out their first waves and then to bring in
[41:08.700 --> 41:12.800]  eye for international mercenary forces
[41:17.560 --> 41:25.080]  oh god they want that they want us to break down like Russia they want us to
[41:25.080 --> 41:29.040]  go into civil war like China they'll sit off at their international
[41:29.040 --> 41:34.440]  command centers offshore orchestrating all of this while all of us Americans
[41:34.440 --> 41:41.040]  destroy our country forever fighting with each other I want to hear from
[41:41.040 --> 41:44.400]  military and I want to hear from police today I want to hear from you go to the
[41:44.400 --> 41:48.000]  headline the lines are full right now I'm gonna go rapidly through the calls I
[41:48.000 --> 41:56.160]  want to hear from you are you gonna go along with this 1-800-25-99231 1-800-25-99231
[41:56.160 --> 42:02.040]  what are your family in the military saying I know they're aware of it it
[42:02.040 --> 42:07.080]  heartens me to know that they're breaking record gun sales everywhere and
[42:07.080 --> 42:14.760]  it's been record gun sales for a year but just break it all the records we
[42:14.760 --> 42:18.560]  become fat and decadent and evil but there's still that core of liberty that
[42:18.560 --> 42:23.000]  core of who our ancestors were and I know that I'm not gonna probably make it
[42:23.000 --> 42:26.040]  through this and a lot of us aren't but we're gonna kick the new world orders
[42:26.040 --> 42:35.720]  but we are gonna win and the enemy is gonna set off nukes when we start
[42:35.720 --> 42:38.280]  beating them they're gonna nerve gas cities they're gonna do everything you
[42:38.280 --> 42:43.400]  can imagine because they're gonna do it they're gonna start the war folks and
[42:43.400 --> 42:46.440]  they're gonna pull out every stop to try to reorganize things globally for
[42:46.440 --> 42:51.720]  emergencies but in the end sanity is gonna prevail and we and the new old
[42:51.720 --> 42:57.640]  order is gonna be arrested and put on trial and they're gonna fall their new
[42:57.640 --> 43:00.680]  world order is gonna fail because it has to fail they're not giving us a
[43:00.680 --> 43:05.480]  choice they are never gonna stop pushing they can't help it it's the nature
[43:05.480 --> 43:09.240]  of control freaks throughout history whether it was Hitler Stalin Mao it
[43:09.240 --> 43:16.360]  doesn't matter and they are gonna lose they are gonna lose the new world order
[43:16.360 --> 43:22.200]  is gonna lose just like the US acting as an empire lost in Vietnam just like
[43:22.200 --> 43:26.440]  Israel just got its butt kicked by Hezbollah those men swore to fight to
[43:26.440 --> 43:34.040]  the death fighting with light arms in a checkered board fashion the new old
[43:34.040 --> 43:37.600]  order is gonna stage terror attacks everything else but they're gonna lose
[43:37.600 --> 43:42.080]  and I would advise people in government but I don't think you're gonna back off
[43:42.080 --> 43:46.320]  but I would advise people in government back off you know your crooks you know
[43:46.320 --> 43:53.400]  you're evil you know you ship the drugs in here I know you want to rob us all I
[43:53.400 --> 43:56.360]  know you want to dominate us I know you've got that instinct to try to
[43:56.360 --> 44:00.080]  dominate everybody but let me tell you back off new world order you're picking
[44:00.080 --> 44:06.280]  a fight you can't win with Russia with the United States with sovereign
[44:06.280 --> 44:10.320]  populations that aren't going to be slaves anymore
[44:10.320 --> 44:16.320]  all right I'm gonna go to some people that disagree first what is it Chris and
[44:16.320 --> 44:20.600]  Tennessee and because that basically I'll go to Sam William John and others now
[44:20.600 --> 44:23.400]  if you disagree just have your comment question right because I can't get stuck
[44:23.400 --> 44:26.280]  for 10 minutes on it and then not get to everybody we've got to break this
[44:26.280 --> 44:30.320]  habit of not taking enough calls because Zach also Chris first he disagrees
[44:30.320 --> 44:35.720]  first Chris in Tennessee go ahead hey I'll try to go really quickly I've
[44:35.720 --> 44:39.440]  looked into this and have found that there's an elaborate PSI op that I think
[44:39.440 --> 44:42.040]  that has everything to do with the chaos if they want to come through this
[44:42.040 --> 44:46.720]  future world war and to bring in the new system and I think that the elites even
[44:46.720 --> 44:50.480]  the so-called Jews have a deep-rooted hanger anger and hatred for the Old
[44:50.480 --> 44:53.080]  Testament believing Jewish people I know you know that and the Ringworm
[44:53.080 --> 44:56.840]  children all that but they say one thing and do another it's like the
[44:56.840 --> 45:01.160]  American border amendment thing and all the all the politicians say you know
[45:01.160 --> 45:04.880]  defend Israel you know nuke Iran but our actions are totally opposite and we
[45:04.880 --> 45:08.200]  fund their enemies to the teeth and you know the AP is you know no no the
[45:08.200 --> 45:11.480]  United so I agree I don't know we're disagreeing about that I know I have
[45:11.480 --> 45:15.520]  when we get to the fight the final thing is really really sick thing but I do
[45:15.520 --> 45:18.400]  think and I know you agree on all this that they they have his brainwashed to
[45:18.400 --> 45:21.480]  think British Bush is a Christian and that's why America is obliged to join
[45:21.480 --> 45:24.880]  this coming deadly war which even if he was a Christian the Bible doesn't say
[45:24.880 --> 45:28.840]  to support Israel militarily you know but says to bless them but but anyway
[45:28.840 --> 45:33.280]  that in itself is a propaganda live but here it is I think that that this
[45:33.280 --> 45:37.720]  World War three is coming it would be blamed just as Albert Pike said on the
[45:37.720 --> 45:42.880]  Judeo-Christian religion so that they can blame everything you know just like
[45:42.880 --> 45:45.680]  the holding truth movement is saying you know they're putting it in our minds
[45:45.680 --> 45:48.640]  that religion is the enemy you know you've got to you've got to fight against
[45:48.640 --> 45:52.280]  religion no no certainly certainly the people in all these groups and the
[45:52.280 --> 45:56.120]  leaders in Israel are luminous and that is their religion and that's what the
[45:56.120 --> 46:00.720]  Rothschilds funded that new you know Israeli Supreme Court with a giant all
[46:00.720 --> 46:04.400]  seeing eye over it and I agree and I'm saying it's a it's a it's it's
[46:04.400 --> 46:10.960]  multinational evil but I'm saying still it is outrageous you know I mean if we
[46:10.960 --> 46:15.640]  had British you know intelligence operatives I mean don't you agree we
[46:15.640 --> 46:19.920]  shouldn't have Rahm Emanuel and Chertoff and Mukasey and of course people are
[46:19.920 --> 46:23.120]  meant to see that that's what I said is that it's meant to create all this
[46:23.120 --> 46:28.160]  anger and then that creates this this dialectic because in the globalist then
[46:28.160 --> 46:31.560]  also create the anti-Israel fervor and run those groups and I said that's why
[46:31.560 --> 46:36.080]  I'm not with those groups but I'm stating what's I'm stating what's happening
[46:36.080 --> 46:40.720]  and I'm not denying that it's going on yeah I just think that that like their
[46:40.720 --> 46:44.760]  paintings Bush to be a Christian they're gonna paint Barack Obama to be you know
[46:44.760 --> 46:47.680]  at all cost if any in Israel so they'll have a good reason to say you know this
[46:47.680 --> 46:50.320]  is why we've gone into war this is all our problem look what it's caused us
[46:50.320 --> 46:54.040]  blah blah blah blah you know and because the new world the new war is
[46:54.040 --> 46:58.000]  going to be a very very sophisticated and the new world war is very very
[46:58.000 --> 47:02.840]  sophisticated and I appreciate your call now I don't do any of this out of a
[47:02.840 --> 47:09.400]  hatred I mean you know I criticize Barack Obama and there's all these people on
[47:09.400 --> 47:15.840]  info wars.com prisonpunna.com saying oh Alex I have a psychology degree and you
[47:15.840 --> 47:22.160]  have suppressed racism towards black people you're just upset he's black
[47:22.160 --> 47:30.800]  no I don't care and I and I and I almost want to come out and you know get
[47:30.800 --> 47:37.040]  past this whole guilt thing and attack the fact that so many black people think
[47:37.040 --> 47:42.560]  it's okay to be racist and hateful towards whites and I'm sick of it you
[47:42.560 --> 47:48.160]  know I grew up in Dallas and in every case I had black people start fights
[47:48.160 --> 47:55.280]  with me with me racially but I don't dislike black folks because of that and
[47:55.280 --> 47:58.880]  I know that all black folks aren't like that in fact a minority of them
[47:58.880 --> 48:03.520]  absolutely hate whiting and I'm not gonna be part of it I'm not gonna sink to
[48:03.520 --> 48:09.920]  that love so it's upsetting to have to come out and criticize Barack Obama
[48:09.920 --> 48:15.040]  because I wish that I could embrace it and I tried to earlier when he said he
[48:15.040 --> 48:18.920]  was anti-war and when he said he was anti-war tap and patriot act now he went
[48:18.920 --> 48:22.640]  back on all that to showing he's gonna be more hawkish than bush and so I'm
[48:22.640 --> 48:29.760]  freaked out the same thing with Israel I can't I don't like criticizing Israel
[48:29.760 --> 48:33.160]  because I don't want to be associated with the backstabbing hateful none of
[48:33.160 --> 48:37.600]  them can even get along with each other anti-Israel anti-Jewish movement that's
[48:37.600 --> 48:42.760]  huge out there and gotten bigger under all this Israel flaunting its its
[48:42.760 --> 48:46.080]  infiltration of the US government and all governments try that Israel's been
[48:46.080 --> 48:52.080]  very successful so see you know this is philosophical and it's it's not
[48:52.080 --> 48:56.400]  complex but for the public it seems to be I don't hate Jews I don't hate Israel
[48:56.400 --> 49:00.040]  I know Israel is very diverse I know Jews are very diverse I know there's
[49:00.040 --> 49:05.440]  really three or four different types of quote Zionism I understand all of that
[49:05.440 --> 49:12.920]  there are more Gentile Zionists and there are Jewish Zionists and so I hate
[49:12.920 --> 49:16.520]  even getting into this subject because it only adds into the Balkanization and
[49:16.520 --> 49:29.840]  the fighting and I don't want to be associated with the people that all
[49:29.840 --> 49:33.040]  they talk about is Israel and all they do is drip with hatred of Jews and then
[49:33.040 --> 49:35.680]  they make up so much stuff you know I go and research what these people say over
[49:35.680 --> 49:40.160]  the years and so much of the time it's made up or exaggerated I mean an
[49:40.160 --> 49:48.200]  example is I am not Jewish my family is not Jewish my my you know I'm also not a
[49:48.200 --> 49:52.560]  Vatican assassin I'm not any of these things that wouldn't be bad if I was and
[49:52.560 --> 49:56.080]  those people say no you are and that's it and so see I don't take them seriously
[49:56.080 --> 49:59.920]  either at the same time we have to get past this taboo of not criticizing
[49:59.920 --> 50:03.560]  Israel I mean Israel can that's it Bragg's aerial show of Bragg that we
[50:03.560 --> 50:07.840]  control America and whether that's true or not that is arrogant and I'm a
[50:07.840 --> 50:14.960]  nationalistic person question is the world getting better or vastly worse
[50:14.960 --> 50:22.320]  a world economic collapse could come any day question are you prepared or are

[55:13.640 --> 55:17.520]  to know that there are 35 million illegal aliens in this country and the
[55:17.520 --> 55:22.120]  majority of those illegal aliens openly on their Mexican radio say that white
[55:22.120 --> 55:25.360]  people are evil they're gonna take over the Southwest and kick the gringo
[55:25.360 --> 55:31.420]  pilgrims out okay and so I'm allowed to say I'm sick of their racism and I'm

[55:52.040 --> 55:55.360]  this multiculturalism is about looking at our differences and hating each other
[55:55.360 --> 55:59.840]  it's about making it an issue when I just want to live in peace with people

[56:17.560 --> 56:22.640]  attractive suggesting that I'm into this because of travelism first of all
[56:22.640 --> 56:27.200]  when I watched Hebrew so-called Negro which was the the documentary that woke
[56:27.200 --> 56:30.120]  me up to the truth and before that by the way I was an atheist but I was
[56:30.120 --> 56:34.040]  learning so much about history and facts and about the Egyptians were black and
[56:34.040 --> 56:37.920]  so the Jews had to be black and Jesus the original paintings are black I was
[56:37.920 --> 56:41.120]  starting certain things are dawning on me but when I watched Hebrew so-called
[56:41.120 --> 56:45.640]  Negro all it did for me was teach me that I was a Jew okay it didn't say
[56:45.640 --> 56:49.800]  black white people are the devil it didn't say that way I didn't know
[56:49.800 --> 56:54.440]  anything what it was the Moses etc etc okay that's the main point that I want
[56:54.440 --> 57:00.680]  to make okay and matter of fact I sent you emails okay from me my name to that
[57:00.680 --> 57:05.920]  to you that shows you my opinions before I came into the truth about these
[57:05.920 --> 57:11.600]  social issues okay and then I and the second email I sent you has videos to

[57:21.160 --> 57:26.000]  tumble and they and they that hate me have lifted up the head they have taken

[1:02:46.360 --> 1:02:53.680]  there swapped it out before I could get out of the parking lot I got pulled over

[1:02:59.400 --> 1:03:05.760]  told me to pull over so I pulled over and they told me that they had got a
[1:03:05.760 --> 1:03:14.080]  call of a possible drug deal and I thought it's kind of strange what I
[1:03:14.080 --> 1:03:18.520]  went ahead and went with it and they wanted to search my truck so let them
[1:03:18.520 --> 1:03:28.200]  search my truck and they they wanted to let me go oh how nice of them they

[1:04:02.720 --> 1:04:10.960]  political views don't go to the torture facility hello friends this is Alex
[1:04:10.960 --> 1:04:14.480]  Jones I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient and
[1:04:14.480 --> 1:04:17.960]  today that's more important than ever we need to be independent and food and
[1:04:17.960 --> 1:04:21.520]  water is the key you'll never have to stand in a red line if you have your
[1:04:21.520 --> 1:04:25.120]  own bread you'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take
[1:04:25.120 --> 1:04:28.800]  care of your family in any emergency if you simply prepare our elected
[1:04:28.800 --> 1:04:32.760]  representatives wanted a good old boy bailout special interest so they ignored
[1:04:32.760 --> 1:04:36.480]  your screams not to do it they turned off the telephones and email they voted to
[1:04:36.480 --> 1:04:41.120]  print 850 billion dollars at least out of thin air this money now owns the
[1:04:41.120 --> 1:04:44.320]  American and European banks the exploding inflation that is now
[1:04:44.320 --> 1:04:48.200]  guaranteed will slash your life savings to nothing and blast the cost of
[1:04:48.200 --> 1:04:52.960]  necessities particularly food beyond many Americans reach in pre-Nazi Germany
[1:04:52.960 --> 1:04:56.960]  super inflation the cost of a loaf of bread doubled every two days until it
[1:04:56.960 --> 1:05:01.320]  reached over four billion marks food prices are skyrocketing so fast there
[1:05:01.320 --> 1:05:05.200]  seems as if there may be no end in sight the private banks merging with our
[1:05:05.200 --> 1:05:08.400]  government are refusing to loan grocery stores enough money to restock their
[1:05:08.400 --> 1:05:12.080]  shelves the stores have less food but jack of prices to stay in business
[1:05:12.080 --> 1:05:16.200]  whatever happens in America we need to be prepared and be ready everything is
[1:05:16.200 --> 1:05:19.480]  zeroing it on food one third of Americans have to choose between buying
[1:05:19.480 --> 1:05:23.440]  food and paying for other necessities my friends whatever it takes get
[1:05:23.440 --> 1:05:27.200]  prepared get self-sufficient get food for everybody out there listening it's
[1:05:27.200 --> 1:05:30.520]  very important for you understand that by having a supply of storeable food the
[1:05:30.520 --> 1:05:33.720]  government the new-old order has a lot less control over you and so it's a
[1:05:33.720 --> 1:05:37.920]  mindset a mindset of self-sufficiency and preparedness no one is going to take
[1:05:37.920 --> 1:05:42.040]  care of your family in the final equation but you you know eFoodsDirect.com is

[1:08:26.680 --> 1:08:30.880]  and it's not like a checkpoint where they block the highway or a road it's a
[1:08:30.880 --> 1:08:34.120]  checkpoint where they'll say have 30 patrol cars out on the stretcher road
[1:08:34.120 --> 1:08:38.320]  broad daylight or could be 2 a.m. in the morning and they just randomly start
[1:08:38.320 --> 1:08:41.440]  pulling people over and they'll say oh you went over the center line or the
[1:08:41.440 --> 1:08:47.080]  lights burn out on your you know over your license plate or we're looking for a

[1:09:03.760 --> 1:09:07.560]  just like the FISA court with random group warrants for the whole country and
[1:09:07.560 --> 1:09:11.840]  that's what they're doing so she found out at work that they were doing the
[1:09:11.840 --> 1:09:16.080]  same thing just randomly pulling people over yeah yeah they've done it to a
[1:09:16.080 --> 1:09:22.120]  bunch of people and it it kind of freaked me out that that had happened it's

[1:11:20.040 --> 1:11:27.000]  she has a little bit harder to convince than me but I had them pull up the
[1:11:27.000 --> 1:11:33.400]  reels over there at the library and those people over there started freaking
[1:11:33.400 --> 1:11:39.680]  out because they didn't know that and I went ahead and gave them a couple of
[1:11:39.680 --> 1:11:45.440]  DVDs you know that had the few of your films on it and you know I've just been

[1:11:50.960 --> 1:11:54.280]  them two DVDs and the person I talked to over there said that they probably won't
[1:11:54.280 --> 1:12:01.040]  do anything about it and I told them what was on it and they started telling me
[1:12:01.040 --> 1:12:04.080]  about FEMA camps and stuff like that so they know some things that are going on
[1:12:04.080 --> 1:12:08.760]  but they won't they won't talk about it on national TV yeah as a nation we're
[1:12:08.760 --> 1:12:12.880]  being bullied and cowed and now they mean people to know they're spied on us
[1:12:12.880 --> 1:12:17.920]  they mean us to know they built the camps so that we cower and go along with it
[1:12:17.920 --> 1:12:23.920]  if we stand up like Freeman and Wimpman and if we stand up like Americans the
[1:12:23.920 --> 1:12:28.840]  enemy's gonna have to back off I took one to the cops too and they asked me
[1:12:28.840 --> 1:12:31.480]  what was on it I started telling them what was on it and the guy started
[1:12:31.480 --> 1:12:37.360]  getting mad I mean he acted like he got mad at me and you know when I left I
[1:12:37.360 --> 1:12:41.560]  pulled out of the parking lot and before I got to the first stop sign they was a

[1:14:10.720 --> 1:14:15.400]  and run them themselves and then it was reporting that half the bars in the

[1:15:58.000 --> 1:16:02.360]  tell you what they'll be taking the gun out of my cold dead hands when this
[1:16:02.360 --> 1:16:14.040]  starts they know that they want to kill you and move into your house there's what
[1:16:14.040 --> 1:16:17.560]  about a hundred and sixty million people that are in this country right now that
[1:16:17.560 --> 1:16:21.280]  are armed what would happen if all of them came together and united against the
[1:16:21.280 --> 1:16:24.680]  government you'd have another American Revolution wouldn't you but see they
[1:16:24.680 --> 1:16:28.960]  plan on pushing us into that we just have to expose how criminal and bankrupt
[1:16:28.960 --> 1:16:31.800]  the government is and that it's the private banks that orchestrated the
[1:16:31.800 --> 1:16:36.000]  economic collapse the private banks taking over and then their system is
[1:16:36.000 --> 1:16:41.640]  just gonna collapse they want to bring it into total civil war and I'm not
[1:16:41.640 --> 1:16:47.120]  saying don't defend yourself I'm saying they're gonna push the people I mean
[1:16:47.120 --> 1:16:50.480]  look they didn't hire twenty six thousand preachers and tell them to train
[1:16:50.480 --> 1:16:54.120]  their flocks to go to FEMA camps and give speeches about Romans 13 and
[1:16:54.120 --> 1:16:58.320]  submitting to government for nothing they're making their move now they won't
[1:16:58.320 --> 1:17:03.000]  fully make it if they understand we've got our ears up but they'll just bomb
[1:17:03.000 --> 1:17:07.280]  more federal buildings and say we did it as a pretext to crack down on us and
[1:17:07.280 --> 1:17:11.600]  they'll find a place with them with them with a place with kids you know they'll
[1:17:11.600 --> 1:17:15.280]  find a daycare center in a building a federal area to show you images of dead
[1:17:15.280 --> 1:17:17.920]  kids they'll have their federal photographers out when little blown up
[1:17:17.920 --> 1:17:21.680]  kids come out and they'll say people that don't want to turn their guns in blew

[1:17:30.880 --> 1:17:35.000]  just one more question that'll be it for me do you think that there's any
[1:17:35.000 --> 1:17:39.440]  connection between the five Russian nuclear weapons that had been supposedly
[1:17:39.440 --> 1:17:43.120]  stolen from Russia have any connection to North com yeah that's right it's
[1:17:43.120 --> 1:17:47.520]  totally made up meanwhile we have mine out North Dakota and we have New

[1:23:20.960 --> 1:23:27.200]  rotating in those battle-hardened brigades it isn't one brigade about five
[1:23:27.200 --> 1:23:32.960]  brigades the bunch of other units that's just the public stuff by the way I told
[1:23:32.960 --> 1:23:35.960]  you that years ago and they announced one brigade a month ago and then they
[1:23:35.960 --> 1:23:39.520]  announced two days ago a bunch of other brigades just exactly the brigades I
[1:23:39.520 --> 1:23:42.800]  told you because we've visited with them we've run into them we've had them
[1:23:42.800 --> 1:23:51.440]  threaten us but they're here they're they work for the foreign banks and it's
[1:23:51.440 --> 1:23:55.200]  not your military it's like under Hitler the military didn't work for the
[1:23:55.200 --> 1:24:05.080]  people anymore work for him John in Texas you're on the air go ahead
[1:24:06.120 --> 1:24:12.600]  Alex yes back in the 70s when I lived outside Detroit I had a chance to talk
[1:24:12.600 --> 1:24:17.040]  with Victor Herman personally no Victor Herman had went to Russia when the
[1:24:17.040 --> 1:24:20.360]  Ford Motor Company built a plant there to work him and a lot of people from
[1:24:20.360 --> 1:24:24.120]  Detroit and when they were there a Stalin had them all arrested a lot of
[1:24:24.120 --> 1:24:27.120]  them were shot but most were put into labor camps and they were beaten and
[1:24:27.120 --> 1:24:31.200]  starved to death he said the only reason he was able to survive was he had to
[1:24:31.200 --> 1:24:38.640]  eat rats raw and a while back I was in the hospital and I had a Vietnamese
[1:24:38.640 --> 1:24:42.520]  nurse and when she found out I was a Vietnamese veteran or I mean a Vietnam
[1:24:42.520 --> 1:24:46.240]  veteran well she couldn't do enough for me but we sat down one day and she was
[1:24:46.240 --> 1:24:50.880]  telling me what her father who was a just a small village mayor he was there
[1:24:50.880 --> 1:24:54.680]  when the communists took over he was arrested put into a reeducation labor
[1:24:54.680 --> 1:24:58.520]  camp they beat and starved them to death the only way he survived was he had
[1:24:58.520 --> 1:25:04.400]  eat worms him and some of the friends were able to escape but their friends
[1:25:04.400 --> 1:25:09.480]  were high down and killed he was able to make it a Thailand escaped but uh that's
[1:25:09.480 --> 1:25:13.800]  what the labor camp system are like and you know that you go to Google that
[1:25:13.800 --> 1:25:17.160]  they already have a labor camp system set up here so when they come to take
[1:25:17.160 --> 1:25:22.120]  your guns mainstream news that with the Americans are in labor camps run by the
[1:25:22.120 --> 1:25:28.320]  army now so when they come to take your guns if you fully set up to give them
[1:25:28.320 --> 1:25:31.640]  up that's what's going to be waiting for you have nothing you have nothing to
[1:25:31.640 --> 1:25:35.880]  lose we didn't ask for this we didn't start it it's not our government don't
[1:25:35.880 --> 1:25:40.880]  let them have your children and don't let them have your guns
[1:25:40.880 --> 1:25:52.560]  anything else oh it's so sick Lyndon and KC you're on the air Alex great to talk
[1:25:52.560 --> 1:25:57.040]  to you today I really enjoy your program thank you hey I've got a couple of
[1:25:57.040 --> 1:26:00.040]  comments and then also I've got a theory I want to discuss with you
[1:26:00.040 --> 1:26:05.560]  comments being here in Kansas City they just announced on the radio and on the
[1:26:05.560 --> 1:26:12.160]  news gun sales had hit a record high and so I think a lot of folks are kind of
[1:26:12.160 --> 1:26:16.280]  sensing something's coming down the pike I think that's probably a trend that's
[1:26:16.280 --> 1:26:19.440]  pretty common around the country just like mice when they know a tornado is
[1:26:19.440 --> 1:26:26.000]  coming or an earthquake two days before you bet hey and my theory is just
[1:26:26.000 --> 1:26:30.880]  wondering why the new world order is taking such a fever pitch these days
[1:26:30.880 --> 1:26:35.600]  and seeming to like me you know not really being trying to disguise what
[1:26:35.600 --> 1:26:41.320]  they're doing have you ever heard of the Planet X theory it's all bold okay so
[1:26:41.320 --> 1:26:44.600]  you don't think there's anything to that yeah no I mean look that's why we've
[1:26:44.600 --> 1:26:47.480]  been unable to wake enough people up as everybody gets in a tube of cobras and
[1:26:47.480 --> 1:26:52.000]  space aliens and Planet X and I mean it's just I mean I mean do asteroids at
[1:26:52.000 --> 1:26:56.200]  the planet absolutely you know as I mean are we floating around in space yeah but
[1:26:56.200 --> 1:26:59.320]  I just stick to what I can prove I mean I've got all these newscasts and mayors
[1:26:59.320 --> 1:27:03.080]  and people and you know where they built camps in their towns a decade ago and
[1:27:03.080 --> 1:27:05.920]  I've had them on and I mean I've read bills where they want to put you in a
[1:27:05.920 --> 1:27:10.360]  in a forest labor camp and you know an organ for 25 years for any misdemeanor
[1:27:10.360 --> 1:27:14.120]  I mean you know it's all real and I can't get folks even deal with that so
[1:27:14.120 --> 1:27:18.880]  they're not doing this for some outer threat they're doing this because they
[1:27:18.880 --> 1:27:23.240]  want a world government and they're ruthless I mean why did Stalin kill
[1:27:23.240 --> 1:27:30.080]  60 million people because he didn't have the they like killing people the the
[1:27:30.080 --> 1:27:34.960]  you know when Stalin really got going after linen they would you know the
[1:27:34.960 --> 1:27:39.920]  NKVD and others would send back letters would list everybody that killed or
[1:27:39.920 --> 1:27:43.960]  stolen from and they'd say okay what we do now and he just said you know
[1:27:43.960 --> 1:27:48.200]  randomly arrest people randomly kill them I mean this is what they like to do
[1:27:48.200 --> 1:27:52.600]  see right it just seems difficult for me to figure out how they get so many
[1:27:52.600 --> 1:27:56.880]  people on board with this in the higher echelons because I got to believe because
[1:27:56.880 --> 1:28:02.080]  they're on power trips man they love it these guys love I mean they're not too
[1:28:02.080 --> 1:28:06.240]  bright number one stay there we'll talk about it more on my good bye

[1:35:53.280 --> 1:35:58.240]  bankers we can defeat them okay finishing up we're gonna Bob Chapman
[1:35:58.240 --> 1:36:02.440]  finishing up with Lyndon in KC Lyndon you're saying how do they get corrupt
[1:36:02.440 --> 1:36:09.160]  police well well you not to go backwards like with Alex but my theory is if we
[1:36:09.160 --> 1:36:13.600]  are if Planet X has re-entered our solar system and they know it they're gonna be
[1:36:13.600 --> 1:36:17.960]  preparing in every diabolical way they can so that's just a made up there what
[1:36:17.960 --> 1:36:21.920]  it's Stalin or how I said happened during the time of Noah it's evident in
[1:36:21.920 --> 1:36:26.560]  mind references about every fourth out 3600 to 4,000 years has kept passes to
[1:36:26.560 --> 1:36:30.800]  our solar system I appreciate your call I guess the Romans slaughtered and
[1:36:30.800 --> 1:36:34.640]  enslaved countries in populations and wanted a police state because of Planet
[1:36:34.640 --> 1:36:38.840]  X and I guess the Aztecs did it because of Planet X and I guess Hitler did what
[1:36:38.840 --> 1:36:42.200]  he did because of Planet X and I mean look I'm not attacking you sir but I
[1:36:42.200 --> 1:36:46.720]  can intellectually just agree with you because I don't they're not gearing up
[1:36:46.720 --> 1:36:50.800]  because they're afraid of some calamity effect I've caught them telling police
[1:36:50.800 --> 1:36:53.720]  they're preparing for some disaster that's how they you ask how they sell
[1:36:53.720 --> 1:36:57.280]  them they tell them the people are gonna riot we've got to do it the economy's
[1:36:57.280 --> 1:37:00.800]  falling apart we didn't do it it's an accident there's lots of terrorists
[1:37:00.800 --> 1:37:06.800]  everywhere the you know we've got to maintain society Bob Chapman the
[1:37:06.800 --> 1:37:09.880]  international forecaster.com military intelligence the largest gold and
[1:37:09.880 --> 1:37:14.960]  silverbroker the largest before he retired then came back now still one of
[1:37:14.960 --> 1:37:18.760]  the biggest newsletters out there on the economy you've dealt with this you were
[1:37:18.760 --> 1:37:26.000]  there with you know Gary and you know so many other people Gary Allen with
[1:37:26.000 --> 1:37:29.680]  Nundair call a conspiracy that millions of copies went out partners with him
[1:37:29.680 --> 1:37:34.160]  you worked with Jebra Griffin you've been around 45 years fighting this how
[1:37:34.160 --> 1:37:38.520]  do they seduce a nation how do they sell the police and the constabulary on
[1:37:38.520 --> 1:37:44.520]  going along with tyranny they just tell them they won't get paid I think it's
[1:37:44.520 --> 1:37:49.240]  pretty simple and that's what happens in every country they said look you know
[1:37:49.240 --> 1:37:52.920]  you've got a job and this is what we want you to do and if you're unwilling
[1:37:52.920 --> 1:37:58.800]  to do that we'll find a way to get rid of you I don't think it's any more
[1:37:58.800 --> 1:38:02.160]  complicated than that yeah but the relish you know I mean I've seen it
[1:38:02.160 --> 1:38:06.880]  newspapers in Kentucky where somebody gives them a Ron Paul video the cops
[1:38:06.880 --> 1:38:11.240]  come to their house and arrest them they put them on trial and say the video was
[1:38:11.240 --> 1:38:15.840]  anti-government and illegal Kelly rushing and the video was a Ron Paul on
[1:38:15.840 --> 1:38:18.960]  the floor of the house and the state police said we don't like your video
[1:38:18.960 --> 1:38:22.000]  and I called the judge at home and he said yeah mr. rushing is going before
[1:38:22.000 --> 1:38:26.320]  the jury next week and and they tried to convict him saying it was a
[1:38:26.320 --> 1:38:29.760]  terroristic threat against the government to hand out those videos I mean how do
[1:38:29.760 --> 1:38:34.880]  you get cops to love destroying America well I think they love to love the
[1:38:34.880 --> 1:38:41.000]  power trip and and it's not a sectarian in nature for the most part it's just
[1:38:41.000 --> 1:38:46.440]  anybody who comes within their clutches whether you know if somebody who shows
[1:38:46.440 --> 1:38:52.240]  what's really going on in the government or someone they might not like for
[1:38:52.240 --> 1:39:00.320]  whatever reason and creating charges against them you know not all policemen
[1:39:00.320 --> 1:39:06.920]  are that way but many of them are unfortunate well yeah it's always the
[1:39:06.920 --> 1:39:10.320]  commander of the police chief and then the fish rots from the head as they say
[1:39:10.320 --> 1:39:14.040]  I found that some areas you got great police forces and other areas you got
[1:39:14.040 --> 1:39:17.000]  the horrible ones but the feds are doing everything they can to put the bad guys
[1:39:17.000 --> 1:39:22.600]  in charge yeah you're right about that and also as you well known you've spoken
[1:39:22.600 --> 1:39:28.280]  about many times the militarization of police and and that that's going to
[1:39:28.280 --> 1:39:34.200]  continue to get to be a larger and larger problem as we go along for people
[1:39:34.200 --> 1:39:37.680]  Bob that don't understand that the military kills people and breaks things
[1:39:37.680 --> 1:39:41.760]  it's a dust against them mentality so when they militarize the police well
[1:39:41.760 --> 1:39:46.840]  who's the enemy it's us the people go ahead no I I think that covers it we
[1:39:46.840 --> 1:39:53.120]  are the enemy I mean they they are going to do what they're told and
[1:39:53.120 --> 1:39:57.880]  unfortunately the police are gonna end up in the middle and if they try to do
[1:39:57.880 --> 1:40:01.920]  things like that to the public sooner or later the public are going to challenge
[1:40:01.920 --> 1:40:07.000]  them and whether it's with weapons or without and that means we won't have
[1:40:07.000 --> 1:40:10.800]  any police left because they can't beat off the people it's too many of them
[1:40:10.800 --> 1:40:17.680]  yeah it's one thing to pour on our doomed if they follow their orders
[1:40:17.680 --> 1:40:25.640]  elaborate they come after Alex they kick his door down at 3 a.m. in the morning
[1:40:25.640 --> 1:40:31.120]  and Alex supposedly reaches for a gun and they fill him up with lead and haul
[1:40:31.120 --> 1:40:37.760]  him out that's the way they do it and that's what they will do I've seen
[1:40:37.760 --> 1:40:45.640]  them do it before that's why I don't live there anymore they don't like me just
[1:40:45.640 --> 1:40:48.680]  like they don't like you
[1:40:48.680 --> 1:40:57.720]  but yours what chain reaction do you see I mean you know inner city folks
[1:40:57.720 --> 1:41:02.560]  burning burning a few buildings and the media I've found that always puts out the
[1:41:02.560 --> 1:41:05.360]  disinfo that they're shooting at firefighters that's generally made up
[1:41:05.360 --> 1:41:09.080]  but you know try to sell the public that oh look they're bad and I think right
[1:41:09.080 --> 1:41:12.080]  that you know that those other rights are bad but it's a totally different thing
[1:41:12.080 --> 1:41:19.880]  if the middle class goes after them and he won't be burning things you mean
[1:41:19.880 --> 1:41:25.960]  rioters or police I'm saying that the American people resisting oh they'll
[1:41:25.960 --> 1:41:32.560]  resist sooner or later and what we'll bring that on will be economic problems
[1:41:32.560 --> 1:41:37.680]  financial problems which we're getting into deeply now and also the
[1:41:37.680 --> 1:41:42.280]  excessiveness of police as they're guided by the Department of Homeland
[1:41:42.280 --> 1:41:49.320]  Security I mean did you see today's unemployment figures yes I did it's
[1:41:49.320 --> 1:41:54.000]  over a million people lost their job in the last year and did did you talk about
[1:41:54.000 --> 1:41:58.560]  it on the air no go ahead and give us an economic rundown well first of all
[1:41:58.560 --> 1:42:03.400]  unemployment this is short-term unemployment and there's a reason for
[1:42:03.400 --> 1:42:09.200]  this what the 6.5 percent from 6.1 which means I don't have it here but what
[1:42:09.200 --> 1:42:14.160]  means u6 u6 is another government figure that tells you about the
[1:42:14.160 --> 1:42:21.640]  unemployment plus the people who lost their unemployment checks recently I'm
[1:42:21.640 --> 1:42:26.360]  projecting about 11 and a half percent on that unemployment long-term
[1:42:26.360 --> 1:42:30.760]  unemployment which is a government figure which was 14% should be 14 and a
[1:42:30.760 --> 1:42:38.160]  half percent now they're telling us still that we don't have a recession well
[1:42:38.160 --> 1:42:44.960]  my goodness gracious I wonder what that is that we're experiencing stimulus
[1:42:44.960 --> 1:42:51.040]  package and they were talking 168 billion like last time I wrote about 300
[1:42:51.040 --> 1:42:56.680]  billion two issues back today they're talking about 500 billion of course that's
[1:42:56.680 --> 1:43:03.880]  not going to solve the problem there's 10.08 million people out of work and in
[1:43:03.880 --> 1:43:08.960]  this past month the highest level in a quarter of a century and of course there
[1:43:08.960 --> 1:43:14.040]  is no recession or at least that would that's what Wall Street and our
[1:43:14.040 --> 1:43:21.640]  government tells us and payrolls and builders the people who make houses drop
[1:43:21.640 --> 1:43:32.680]  49,000 30 to 35,000 before that the month before financial firms lost 24,000 after
[1:43:32.680 --> 1:43:39.560]  losing 16,000 a month before insurance companies restaurants retail is
[1:43:39.560 --> 1:43:45.960]  subtracted 108,000 after being up 201,000 the previous month payroll is
[1:43:45.960 --> 1:43:55.360]  decreased by 38,000 in retail it was down 20,300 the previous month government
[1:43:55.360 --> 1:44:01.440]  payrolls went up 23,000 of course that's how they cover some of this stuff and it
[1:44:01.440 --> 1:44:09.400]  goes on it is dreadful reading and those aren't even the real figures the real
[1:44:09.400 --> 1:44:15.640]  figures are being hidden from the American public and what are the real
[1:44:15.640 --> 1:44:22.800]  figures probably long-term is probably around 17 to 18 percent well well Bob I'm
[1:44:22.800 --> 1:44:27.280]  in the supposed per capita most wealthy city best off on real estate business
[1:44:27.280 --> 1:44:32.640]  industry the college here in Austin Texas and I'm talking probably a third of
[1:44:32.640 --> 1:44:37.760]  the restaurants whether it's Delaware sub I used to go to or or a nicer
[1:44:37.760 --> 1:44:42.280]  restaurant they're just gone they're just closed down they're just not there
[1:44:42.280 --> 1:44:47.320]  anymore there are in the nicest parts of town and the poorest parts of town
[1:44:47.320 --> 1:44:52.720]  things boarded up businesses gyms closing companies laying off masses of
[1:44:52.720 --> 1:44:58.120]  people every media company in town it's just slashing employees slashing
[1:44:58.120 --> 1:45:02.600]  people and then they tell you the economy's good the economy's great up
[1:45:02.600 --> 1:45:05.400]  we're not even in a recession I mean they just talked to us like we're
[1:45:05.400 --> 1:45:09.480]  children well retail sales figures come out this morning I don't have them in
[1:45:09.480 --> 1:45:13.920]  front of me but they were dreadful yeah it's the worst it's the worst leading
[1:45:13.920 --> 1:45:22.080]  into Christmas sales they say in over 25 years exactly and they say that 50 to
[1:45:22.080 --> 1:45:28.120]  60% Markov's are not even nobody's rising to the bait and they having to
[1:45:28.120 --> 1:45:34.320]  discount 70 80% well Bob let me go back here I mean in the past and other big
[1:45:34.320 --> 1:45:38.160]  recessions and things they would admit it why are they lying now is it just all
[1:45:38.160 --> 1:45:42.320]  part of the total deception yeah it's all part of the total deception is just
[1:45:42.320 --> 1:45:47.440]  like the suppression of markets the increases in other markets I mean look
[1:45:47.440 --> 1:45:51.360]  they just ran the dollar up it's gonna go back down but they ran it up they just
[1:45:51.360 --> 1:45:56.080]  ran the stock market up today when the retail figures came out and then the
[1:45:56.080 --> 1:46:01.600]  unemployment figures the stock market was up 50 points a Dow it's up 200 points
[1:46:01.600 --> 1:46:07.400]  right now in round figures now how can that happen that is ridiculous and so
[1:46:07.400 --> 1:46:11.400]  our government is in there pushing the market up because normally it would get
[1:46:11.400 --> 1:46:14.960]  out three or four or five hundred points based on that news Bob I want to shift
[1:46:14.960 --> 1:46:19.880]  gears Obama out of the gates he's announcing
[1:46:19.880 --> 1:46:24.960]  Rahm Emanuel who is the head of the major gunman groups I mean that's in
[1:46:24.960 --> 1:46:28.120]  mainstream news he is the head gun grabber in the country he's the guy that
[1:46:28.120 --> 1:46:33.320]  got the assault weapons ban through NAFTA through this guy is is openly a
[1:46:33.320 --> 1:46:38.120]  Mossad agent he I mean that's even admitted Israeli military I mean I mean
[1:46:38.120 --> 1:46:41.120]  again I'm against Arnold being a cabinet member because he's not a real you know
[1:46:41.120 --> 1:46:45.520]  full citizen and won't renounce his Austrian things so it's the same thing
[1:46:45.520 --> 1:46:48.920]  with Rahm Emanuel they're talking about putting Arnold in there to be the
[1:46:48.920 --> 1:46:54.640]  greenhouse czar to go around slapping quote bankrupting the coal industry 49%
[1:46:54.640 --> 1:46:57.240]  of the power it's actually hotter than that but that's their number they're
[1:46:57.240 --> 1:47:00.960]  using number I've got family that works in coal just more like 60% of real power
[1:47:00.960 --> 1:47:05.920]  electrical power to our homes now they factor in yeah but side issue the point
[1:47:05.920 --> 1:47:11.040]  is they're announcing that they are going to tax all plastic they are going
[1:47:11.040 --> 1:47:15.680]  to tax all fuel they're gonna tax all coal all oil they I mean and then of
[1:47:15.680 --> 1:47:18.680]  course the third world countries they aren't gonna have greenhouse taxes so
[1:47:18.680 --> 1:47:23.560]  even more jobs are gonna leave who are they planning to tax Bob I don't know
[1:47:23.560 --> 1:47:28.080]  but it's gonna be pretty difficult and it's you know just another you know like
[1:47:28.080 --> 1:47:32.880]  you said changing gears for the Illuminati they just ratcheting up one
[1:47:32.880 --> 1:47:40.800]  more gear and I I think in order to obliquely take attention away from what's
[1:47:40.800 --> 1:47:44.840]  going on financially and economically plus all these other little goodies that
[1:47:44.840 --> 1:47:51.720]  you just mentioned I think they're gonna have a war and we discussed this last
[1:47:51.720 --> 1:47:58.840]  week when Paul Watson was on and I think what they're going to do is
[1:47:58.840 --> 1:48:07.240]  probably embargo Iran's oil exports and that will hopefully as far as they
[1:48:07.240 --> 1:48:12.240]  concerned draw them into a war and of course if they draw a ran and they'll
[1:48:12.240 --> 1:48:15.680]  be drawing right now let's explain they're gonna stick more destroyers in
[1:48:15.680 --> 1:48:19.840]  the Strait of Hermos and not allow the Iranians and embargo is an act of war
[1:48:19.840 --> 1:48:23.640]  that's killing their economy that's the main part of their economy and under
[1:48:23.640 --> 1:48:26.200]  international law if you're illegally embargo you're allowed to defend
[1:48:26.200 --> 1:48:30.880]  yourself just like yeah well but the point here is is that they're saying the
[1:48:30.880 --> 1:48:34.880]  big surprise in January they're saying it is that what you're saying the big
[1:48:34.880 --> 1:48:40.120]  surprise is I think so and I think they're gonna sneak attack Iran is what
[1:48:40.120 --> 1:48:45.640]  they're gonna do if they refuse to capitulate to get on their knees and
[1:48:45.640 --> 1:48:51.760]  say we'll come and look at what we're doing when I'm making bombs here
[1:48:54.280 --> 1:48:57.840]  meanwhile they're putting out false reports that Russian nukes are missing
[1:48:57.840 --> 1:49:04.840]  meanwhile US nukes really are missing might not remember that yeah God help
[1:49:04.840 --> 1:49:10.520]  us God help us the globalists are completely ruthless we're gonna talk
[1:49:10.520 --> 1:49:14.760]  about what they may be planning to do what they say they're planning to do with
[1:49:14.760 --> 1:49:20.280]  our new savior Lord Obama with the days getting shorter and the nights getting

[1:51:23.400 --> 1:51:27.840]  a survival retreat is a place you go to live not die it is a place out of the

[1:51:45.800 --> 1:51:51.440]  why retreat this is a question that 90% of our population cannot and will not
[1:51:51.440 --> 1:51:56.000]  answer if they could that same 90% would have to admit that things may not
[1:51:56.000 --> 1:51:59.840]  continue on as they are now they would also have to admit that they will need a
[1:51:59.840 --> 1:52:04.880]  retreat something completely impossible for the average American to do act now
[1:52:04.880 --> 1:52:09.960]  before it's too late in order to find your new high security self-sufficient

[1:52:39.800 --> 1:53:06.160]  look at this headline u.s. admiral wants pain ray guns for fleet
[1:53:06.160 --> 1:53:12.160]  Mullen military is ready to respond to transformation terror attack you sing they
[1:53:12.160 --> 1:53:21.800]  need another terror attack to be able to launch more wars the Denver post
[1:53:21.800 --> 1:53:27.560]  reports undercover cops are among unruly at DNC mainstream news we told you we
[1:53:27.560 --> 1:53:31.520]  knew it they were in there provocaturing they were in there starting the
[1:53:31.520 --> 1:53:36.280]  fights we talked to eyewitnesses including radio station workers who were
[1:53:36.280 --> 1:53:40.240]  there setting up to do live feeds in one of the major parks down by the
[1:53:40.240 --> 1:53:47.360]  Capitol and they said yeah these vans pulled up and these guys jumped out
[1:53:47.360 --> 1:53:54.520]  these Marines and then they right under those trees put on anarchist outfits
[1:53:54.520 --> 1:53:56.560]  who went and started fights I wouldn't talk to other witnesses and they said
[1:53:56.560 --> 1:54:03.920]  cops would do it and now here it is I mean I want to go back into Iran Bob but
[1:54:03.920 --> 1:54:08.920]  how do they get cops all over the u.s. all over Europe to go out and stage
[1:54:08.920 --> 1:54:13.000]  violence so they can attack the peaceful protesters I mean I mean it's hard for
[1:54:13.000 --> 1:54:18.880]  me to believe that our police are so criminal Bob well it has been that way
[1:54:18.880 --> 1:54:24.440]  for a long long time it's just that people are noticing more than they have
[1:54:24.440 --> 1:54:29.160]  since the 1960s and they were provocaturing there they were funding
[1:54:29.160 --> 1:54:36.080]  what supposedly was the opposition the FBI and policing agencies were in
[1:54:36.080 --> 1:54:42.000]  full-filtrating groups that had never done anything wrong and they think it's
[1:54:42.000 --> 1:54:49.640]  okay to stage violence so they can demonize the crowd and then exactly put
[1:54:49.640 --> 1:54:54.920]  it on the news because again you got to demonize Americans protesting back to
[1:54:54.920 --> 1:55:00.680]  the crisis for those who don't know Colin Powell Joe Biden and literally scores
[1:55:00.680 --> 1:55:05.880]  of other world leaders have said major international crisis in January and
[1:55:05.880 --> 1:55:09.680]  they've even written all these white papers saying boy another terror attack
[1:55:09.680 --> 1:55:16.320]  would sure be great you think that's in the cards Bob yes how it will come
[1:55:16.320 --> 1:55:22.360]  remains to be seen but they'll be there it may be a group of events or it may be
[1:55:22.360 --> 1:55:27.200]  a large event but if they get this thing going on in the Middle East they
[1:55:27.200 --> 1:55:30.960]  probably don't need an event I think they've already decided that they're
[1:55:30.960 --> 1:55:37.800]  gonna pull this embargo thing and and then I think Iran's gonna be well it
[1:55:37.800 --> 1:55:42.400]  being pressured now and I think it's just gonna be told look you know if you
[1:55:42.400 --> 1:55:47.880]  don't do what we tell you to do it's curtains and they'll disagree and the
[1:55:47.880 --> 1:55:51.360]  Israel area will immediately attack what they offer the United States that's
[1:55:51.360 --> 1:55:54.480]  right and again they knew Bush was a political dead duck and too much
[1:55:54.480 --> 1:55:59.360]  political pressure from the left but with Obama just like Belgrade and Serbia
[1:55:59.360 --> 1:56:04.200]  it's gonna be okay and that's why Biden saying it's gonna be very unpopular
[1:56:04.200 --> 1:56:11.080]  with the left I think you're right and I think he's right as well now now by
[1:56:11.080 --> 1:56:16.480]  embargo you mean blockade right but they're gonna they're gonna think attack
[1:56:16.480 --> 1:56:20.400]  them just like the Japanese did at Pearl Harbor and they're gonna go after
[1:56:20.400 --> 1:56:26.440]  there not only the nuclear facilities but all of their military facilities and
[1:56:26.440 --> 1:56:32.760]  the question is when this attack comes will the Russians act immediately or
[1:56:32.760 --> 1:56:38.000]  will they act after that that remains to be seen but the Russians are going to
[1:56:38.000 --> 1:56:44.600]  react when NATO forces went into pristina the capital of Kosovo the
[1:56:44.600 --> 1:56:49.800]  Russians moved in and general Clark Wesley Clark gave the order to attack
[1:56:49.800 --> 1:56:54.080]  the Russians but general Jackson the head of NATO countermanded it that would
[1:56:54.080 --> 1:56:57.640]  have been World War three by the way back in one minute

[1:57:40.400 --> 1:57:45.120]  been detained in Laden's connections to the CIA the hijackers ties to the FBI

[1:59:40.680 --> 1:59:45.560]  into Pakistan get ready to start stuff with the Russians and anybody who
[1:59:45.560 --> 1:59:48.600]  doubts these globalists it looks like it's just neocon to that's who they're
[1:59:48.600 --> 1:59:53.600]  putting back in the same people that job I mean they should not attack Russia two
[1:59:53.600 --> 1:59:59.760]  months ago they stage 9-11 they went into two other countries I mean these are
[1:59:59.760 --> 2:00:06.160]  bold individuals aren't they Bob very bold never like that before but now
[2:00:06.160 --> 2:00:11.880]  they're I don't know whether they're comfortable what they're doing or I think
[2:00:11.880 --> 2:00:18.280]  more so I think they're afraid that if they don't move expeditiously to get
[2:00:18.280 --> 2:00:25.960]  this war going to deflect the economic and financial situation and to get
[2:00:25.960 --> 2:00:31.320]  young people in many countries in the world off the streets and into combat
[2:00:31.320 --> 2:00:36.280]  so that they can get killed which of course is population control and at the
[2:00:36.280 --> 2:00:39.760]  same time the United States government comes they look we're gonna have to
[2:00:39.760 --> 2:00:43.720]  default on all of our debt because we can't pay it because this terrible war
[2:00:43.720 --> 2:00:46.880]  has bankrupted us and you're going to have to sacrifice because we're in a
[2:00:46.880 --> 2:00:51.440]  global war we're losing we already see him the first night you know when he
[2:00:51.440 --> 2:00:55.800]  won Tuesday night he should get ready for paying get ready for austerity get
[2:00:55.800 --> 2:00:59.520]  ready for sacrifice and now the Democrats are saying get ready for
[2:00:59.520 --> 2:01:07.560]  national service which is a draft it's right so if you wanted to get your kids
[2:01:07.560 --> 2:01:11.160]  out of the country your grandchildren out of the country you better start
[2:01:11.160 --> 2:01:15.440]  thinking about it and don't expect to send them to Canada because they'll send
[2:01:15.440 --> 2:01:21.640]  them back well that's what elites do throughout history they it's their
[2:01:21.640 --> 2:01:25.120]  instinct to want more power and more domination but they're also bored I mean
[2:01:25.120 --> 2:01:28.560]  they like people starving they like people degradated a lot of ran
[2:01:28.560 --> 2:01:32.240]  corporation documents have come out Carnegie Endowment for Peace it says
[2:01:32.240 --> 2:01:36.080]  they want war they admit it's it's it the wars are really against domestic
[2:01:36.080 --> 2:01:45.560]  populations well a good example is the the plan to invade South Africa which
[2:01:45.560 --> 2:01:50.680]  was put up by Carnegie in 1962 and incidentally I still have a copy of
[2:01:50.680 --> 2:01:57.240]  that and had not they've been able to accomplish what they did via the
[2:01:57.240 --> 2:02:03.880]  isolation of South Africa they would have gone in and invaded it because they
[2:02:03.880 --> 2:02:08.720]  love black people and it wasn't because they love black people as they shoot
[2:02:08.720 --> 2:02:12.360]  them up with HIV in there in their UN shots it was because they don't want
[2:02:12.360 --> 2:02:19.120]  any sovereign standalone nation well they they they consider people in Africa
[2:02:19.120 --> 2:02:24.480]  useless eaters as they do in Asia and parts of Central and South America and
[2:02:24.480 --> 2:02:29.080]  that's just their attitude there's to them they're subhumans finish what you
[2:02:29.080 --> 2:02:35.200]  were gonna say about South Africa about the invasion of South Africa well you
[2:02:35.200 --> 2:02:38.840]  were saying they were gonna do it and they didn't have to they were
[2:02:38.840 --> 2:02:44.040]  successful politically the african is bend over and said he'll take the
[2:02:44.040 --> 2:02:51.440]  country so they didn't have to have an invasion but they surely had one plan I
[2:02:51.440 --> 2:02:58.640]  live there you know between 1969 and 1973 for three years both in South
[2:02:58.640 --> 2:03:04.360]  Africa and what used to be Rodisha which is not called the Zimbabwe so I lived in
[2:03:04.360 --> 2:03:09.720]  those places during those years where the pressure continued to build and I
[2:03:09.720 --> 2:03:13.520]  guess they figured Rodisha would be the easiest so in 1980 they knocked them off
[2:03:13.520 --> 2:03:16.680]  first stay there stay there
[2:03:16.680 --> 2:03:21.520]  hello friends this is Alex Jones I've told you for a long time it's important
[2:03:21.520 --> 2:03:24.800]  to be self-sufficient and today that's more important than ever we need to be
[2:03:24.800 --> 2:03:28.360]  independent and food and water is the key you'll never have to stand in a
[2:03:28.360 --> 2:03:31.640]  red line if you have your own bread you'll never have to go to the super
[2:03:31.640 --> 2:03:35.480]  dome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency if you
[2:03:35.480 --> 2:03:39.000]  simply prepare our elected representatives wanted a good old boy bailout
[2:03:39.000 --> 2:03:42.640]  for the special interest so they ignored your screams not to do it they turned
[2:03:42.640 --> 2:03:47.400]  off the telephones and email they voted to print $850 billion at least out of
[2:03:47.400 --> 2:03:51.480]  thin air this money now owns the American and European banks the exploding
[2:03:51.480 --> 2:03:55.240]  inflation that is now guaranteed will slash your life savings to nothing and
[2:03:55.240 --> 2:03:59.360]  blast the cost of the assessments particularly food beyond many Americans
[2:03:59.360 --> 2:04:03.240]  reach in pre-Nazi Germany super inflation the cost of a loaf of bread
[2:04:03.240 --> 2:04:07.840]  doubled every two days until it reached over four billion marks food prices are
[2:04:07.840 --> 2:04:12.040]  skyrocketing so fast there seems as if there may be no end in sight the private
[2:04:12.040 --> 2:04:15.680]  banks merging with our government are refusing to loan grocery stores enough
[2:04:15.680 --> 2:04:19.560]  money to restock their shelves the stores have less food but jack of prices to
[2:04:19.560 --> 2:04:23.320]  stay in business whatever happens in America we need to be prepared and be
[2:04:23.320 --> 2:04:26.960]  ready everything is zeroing in on food one third of Americans have to choose
[2:04:26.960 --> 2:04:31.040]  between buying food and paying for other necessities my friends whatever it takes
[2:04:31.040 --> 2:04:35.320]  get prepared get self-sufficient get food for everybody out there listening it's
[2:04:35.320 --> 2:04:38.640]  very important for you understand that by having a supply of storable food the
[2:04:38.640 --> 2:04:41.840]  government the new-old order has a lot less control over you and so it's a
[2:04:41.840 --> 2:04:46.040]  mindset a mindset of self-sufficiency and preparedness no one is going to take
[2:04:46.040 --> 2:04:50.160]  care of your family in the final equation but you you know eFoodsDirect.com is
[2:04:50.160 --> 2:04:53.920]  still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli salmonella genetic

[2:06:24.600 --> 2:06:29.240]  borders up they're going to do all kinds of things that depend the American public
[2:06:29.240 --> 2:06:33.120]  doesn't want but yet they voted these people in there's going to be a lot of
[2:06:33.120 --> 2:06:38.920]  consternation unemployment is really rising yes inflation's backed up a
[2:06:38.920 --> 2:06:42.880]  little bit but that's for a few months it's going to go higher again we're
[2:06:42.880 --> 2:06:47.560]  going to have stagnation inflation at the same time which is called stagflation
[2:06:47.560 --> 2:06:53.020]  and this is going to go on for a long time and the inflation is going to get
[2:06:53.020 --> 2:06:58.280]  worse and the unemployment's going to get worse and as that evolves they expect
[2:06:58.280 --> 2:07:02.360]  that they're going to be able to start a war you know who knows or it's all going
[2:07:02.360 --> 2:07:12.440]  to end up but strap yourselves in strap yourself in but the globalist could
[2:07:12.440 --> 2:07:15.840]  never really have a horrible police state here before and really go through all
[2:07:15.840 --> 2:07:20.640]  the motions because we still had good police could military basic values you
[2:07:20.640 --> 2:07:23.520]  watch shows like Knight Rider and the rest of them and it's all about the
[2:07:23.520 --> 2:07:29.080]  militias going to nuke the damn the constitutionalist or the terrorist and I
[2:07:29.080 --> 2:07:33.400]  guess cops watching TV think that's reality I mean I mean if anybody who had
[2:07:33.400 --> 2:07:37.680]  a brain would go my god we've got evil government evil Hollywood selling us the
[2:07:37.680 --> 2:07:41.400]  image that the American people are bad I mean can't people see they're setting
[2:07:41.400 --> 2:07:45.920]  us up for total evil I mean couldn't average cop watch that and go man we've
[2:07:45.920 --> 2:07:51.200]  got a really bad government well I think you're right and that's the
[2:07:51.200 --> 2:07:54.920]  easier take on it but I don't think that's true with the military I think the
[2:07:54.920 --> 2:08:00.520]  military realizes that the difference between right and wrong and it's wrong
[2:08:00.520 --> 2:08:05.080]  to shoot your own citizens well that's the good news Admiral Fallon head of
[2:08:05.080 --> 2:08:08.800]  simcom design and refused to launch the attack on Iran so isn't that an ace in
[2:08:08.800 --> 2:08:15.640]  the hole that that well there's an awful lot of people out there who are ex and
[2:08:15.640 --> 2:08:21.240]  active military who think you exactly the way we do believe me and I do one
[2:08:21.240 --> 2:08:26.080]  program that's pointed all toward military and you would be amazed at the
[2:08:26.080 --> 2:08:29.680]  information that comes in it's just incredible I tell you everything that's
[2:08:29.680 --> 2:08:36.680]  going on out there all right I want to go to some calls in fact later if
[2:08:36.680 --> 2:08:39.960]  military or police can get in I mean are you gonna confiscate our guns I've
[2:08:39.960 --> 2:08:43.840]  asked Austin cops and they've said yeah we're ordered to we will just like in
[2:08:43.840 --> 2:08:46.360]  that news piece in New Orleans where the troops say well we don't like
[2:08:46.360 --> 2:08:51.760]  confiscating guns and shooting Americans but we've been ordered to yeah well they
[2:08:51.760 --> 2:08:55.960]  may as well make out their wills because this time around they're not gonna go
[2:08:55.960 --> 2:09:02.640]  home don't they know that's high treason don't they understand the
[2:09:02.640 --> 2:09:09.080]  government's criminal I think they do it's all the job you know like at the
[2:09:09.080 --> 2:09:13.240]  Nuremberg trials well you know that I was ordered to do that I mean there's a
[2:09:13.240 --> 2:09:19.080]  classic case of the police chief of Hamburg the best in Germany after the
[2:09:19.080 --> 2:09:24.960]  elections in 1932 Hitler called him and said look I know you hate me but you're
[2:09:24.960 --> 2:09:28.880]  the best cop in the country I want you to stay in the job just don't bother me
[2:09:28.880 --> 2:09:34.120]  too much but do your job so the guy says okay so with the Nuremberg war crime
[2:09:34.120 --> 2:09:38.080]  strier they will you know you shipped all of those people off to concentration
[2:09:38.080 --> 2:09:41.960]  camps and you did this and the other thing you shouldn't have done and the
[2:09:41.960 --> 2:09:47.520]  guy says well all I was doing is following the law do you got to get the
[2:09:47.520 --> 2:09:52.600]  same thing today the only thing in America is we have weapons and they
[2:09:52.600 --> 2:09:54.800]  didn't
[2:09:56.520 --> 2:10:03.720]  Rico and Toronto you're on the air with the Bob Chapman hi Bob hi Alex
[2:10:03.720 --> 2:10:12.000]  hi quick for you Bob do you still recommend the Swiss bonds as something
[2:10:12.000 --> 2:10:16.600]  to at least hold your money for those who don't want to be in gold and silver
[2:10:16.600 --> 2:10:21.960]  related assets or have to what they feel is too much of their assets in gold and
[2:10:21.960 --> 2:10:26.680]  silver then that isn't the only alternative that I can see I think it
[2:10:26.680 --> 2:10:32.580]  is the best of a lot of bad currencies but if you got to be somewhere I think
[2:10:32.580 --> 2:10:39.840]  that's the place to be okay okay and and my second question of points like
[2:10:39.840 --> 2:10:46.520]  Alex it would be really interesting everything to get Ferrican on to
[2:10:46.520 --> 2:10:52.560]  really debate what to discuss we have tried to get Ferrican on okay never
[2:10:52.560 --> 2:10:59.040]  any response they've said things like he's not doing interviews right now okay
[2:10:59.040 --> 2:11:04.600]  okay and my last point on what which which were saying before I mean it's
[2:11:04.600 --> 2:11:09.160]  always the same thing like I read this book before called the crime and
[2:11:09.160 --> 2:11:13.280]  privilege by Barry Kreisberg have you ever read it Alex no no okay well
[2:11:13.280 --> 2:11:19.760]  basically this talks about that the people in power the people would with
[2:11:19.760 --> 2:11:24.040]  money he knew how they got that power which was through the sword when he
[2:11:24.040 --> 2:11:28.320]  became the Royal P and raping and pillaging through the countryside and
[2:11:28.320 --> 2:11:30.960]  they were always afraid of the public because they knew that one day the
[2:11:30.960 --> 2:11:34.280]  public could come for their money because they knew how they got their money so
[2:11:34.280 --> 2:11:39.120]  what they did is they got the actual police force like this is like the
[2:11:39.120 --> 2:11:43.480]  mid-century they got a police force out of the jail that's what they picked
[2:11:43.480 --> 2:11:47.800]  there the people wouldn't force no exactly they always hire criminals or
[2:11:47.800 --> 2:11:52.280]  criminal psychological profiles and now they openly for the military and police
[2:11:52.280 --> 2:11:55.680]  hire felons correct that's what Stalin did Hitler did it
[2:11:55.680 --> 2:12:00.240]  Hitler's essay was mainly that brought him to power were criminals correct it's
[2:12:00.240 --> 2:12:04.760]  always the same thing because they know they were in force they lost
[2:12:04.760 --> 2:12:09.640]  with no problems and now they've got all this PR about how good they are how
[2:12:09.640 --> 2:12:16.000]  good wonderful they are the government is run by a pack of criminals and then
[2:12:16.000 --> 2:12:18.840]  you got a few in the system who aren't criminals but the system itself's
[2:12:18.840 --> 2:12:23.480]  criminal all you need to do is look at history they put all these institutions
[2:12:23.480 --> 2:12:26.440]  in place but they have to control over the people that's that's all that sweet
[2:12:26.440 --> 2:12:33.320]  the same thing exactly never changes so it changes when people stand up in a
[2:12:33.320 --> 2:12:37.680]  population doesn't greedily guard their liberty and aggressively stand up they
[2:12:37.680 --> 2:12:43.320]  get enslaved but that's the institution that yet to see the most is the
[2:12:43.320 --> 2:12:48.360]  government but now they teach police and I have the training videos and anybody
[2:12:48.360 --> 2:12:52.120]  that says that is a terrorist that's what the founding fathers and what was
[2:12:52.120 --> 2:12:55.480]  taught in school and then we went and what is true but now you the cops are
[2:12:55.480 --> 2:13:00.800]  told that that's evil government is God and is everything I appreciate your
[2:13:00.800 --> 2:13:07.120]  call good points huh Bob here are Christy in New York you're on the
[2:13:07.120 --> 2:13:18.000]  ear Alex yes skull skull listen I just like to say that if John McCain had
[2:13:18.000 --> 2:13:24.840]  been elected and tried to institute the draft that there would be all kinds of
[2:13:24.840 --> 2:13:34.520]  demonstrations student protests riots and it wouldn't go over but if Barack
[2:13:34.520 --> 2:13:40.600]  Obama made an impassioned plea just like George W. did for the bailout but to
[2:13:40.600 --> 2:13:47.320]  the people the young the youth groups exactly oh we're gonna do it and it's a
[2:13:47.320 --> 2:13:53.400]  holy war for Lord Obama now to bear arms for our country they would line up sign
[2:13:53.400 --> 2:14:01.000]  up and re-enlist and unfortunately if this goes right in with what Bob was
[2:14:01.000 --> 2:14:08.680]  saying and it this is the way we can we can block we can we can stop them we
[2:14:08.680 --> 2:14:12.520]  as a people have a choice in this we don't have to go along with this they
[2:14:12.520 --> 2:14:18.200]  hit us with all these other things you know 9-11 and all this other stuff what
[2:14:18.200 --> 2:14:24.640]  they want to do is depopulate and what better way than this and if we as a as
[2:14:24.640 --> 2:14:31.920]  the American people call up our Bibles and our guns then they're gonna have a
[2:14:31.920 --> 2:14:37.720]  problem getting that draft back in and if we move now and if we take action and
[2:14:37.720 --> 2:14:43.240]  I'll tell you another thing all this fear stuff is gonna do nothing except get
[2:14:43.240 --> 2:14:48.880]  us killed we have to be strong we have to be centered in our prayer and our
[2:14:48.880 --> 2:14:55.640]  families and we have to understand that this is what we need to do now and we
[2:14:55.640 --> 2:14:59.120]  have to be committed but I agree preemptively expose they're gonna stage
[2:14:59.120 --> 2:15:03.720]  wars preemptively expose that it's the same agenda under Obama that it was
[2:15:03.720 --> 2:15:09.040]  under Bush and the people are seeing it though I mean Bob Chapman record gun
[2:15:09.040 --> 2:15:14.000]  sales nationwide breaking all records and it's only intensifying they are
[2:15:14.000 --> 2:15:18.640]  buying guns and ammo off the shelves Bob that's right and I reported on a
[2:15:18.640 --> 2:15:26.940]  tomorrow's issue and the availability one stock is out is you know a month to
[2:15:26.940 --> 2:15:37.240]  two months away it's just a wipeout one store had 5,000 weapons available AR-15
[2:15:37.240 --> 2:15:44.680]  they had 10 left and the writer who wrote to me said he got two of them it
[2:15:44.680 --> 2:15:51.960]  obviously people are very concerned about what Obama is going to do and and
[2:15:51.960 --> 2:15:57.280]  also they're very concerned about gun control I get a piece in there a link to
[2:15:57.280 --> 2:16:05.280]  the the to bear arms the group and you'll see what they have to say about it
[2:16:05.280 --> 2:16:11.440]  you can get a free introductory copy to this thing the international
[2:16:11.440 --> 2:16:16.000]  forecasters don't hesitate absolutely get that copy coming out tomorrow we'll
[2:16:16.000 --> 2:16:20.880]  tell folks how to get it but even the New York Times admitted you know it was
[2:16:20.880 --> 2:16:25.000]  mainline Houston the biggest gun shop and they said we know he's coming with
[2:16:25.000 --> 2:16:30.360]  domestic Stasi police you know basic FEMA camp stuff I mean when the main line
[2:16:30.360 --> 2:16:37.760]  is saying we know they're coming with the Stasi the words out Bob well if they
[2:16:37.760 --> 2:16:43.680]  try it they're gonna be meant with force and again as I said earlier I would not
[2:16:43.680 --> 2:16:47.760]  want to be in law enforcement because if you go after the public you're not
[2:16:47.760 --> 2:16:54.920]  going home to your family it's over you ought to see all these new SWAT guys the
[2:16:54.920 --> 2:16:59.080]  feds are paying the radically expandable police departments paramilitary
[2:16:59.080 --> 2:17:04.680]  snatching bags listen we would change train just as well as they are today no
[2:17:04.680 --> 2:17:08.880]  I know the point I'm making is as you see these young guys they just they just
[2:17:08.880 --> 2:17:11.320]  love it they've got these women and children they can feed on they feel
[2:17:11.320 --> 2:17:17.880]  powerful they feel big oh yeah but they have no idea no idea all right thank you

[2:23:17.000 --> 2:23:21.360]  hi Bob I wanted to thank you first for all the great information you put out
[2:23:21.360 --> 2:23:27.800]  there thanks for your show and I want to come back to round the manual and I
[2:23:27.800 --> 2:23:32.240]  don't know I've seen the the article you put up on Prison Planet you didn't
[2:23:32.240 --> 2:23:38.320]  mention the just curious if you saw it the quote by his father responding to
[2:23:38.320 --> 2:23:46.400]  his nomination as the White House Chief of Staff and you know asking if you know
[2:23:46.400 --> 2:23:51.400]  he he was an Arab and saying he wasn't gonna you know sweep the floor to the
[2:23:51.400 --> 2:23:57.760]  White House and you know we have this new inquisition right now basically
[2:23:57.760 --> 2:24:01.960]  telling us that you know if we don't like Obama where we have to be you know
[2:24:01.960 --> 2:24:08.880]  closet racist and this is the man that we have as Chief of Staff his father made
[2:24:08.880 --> 2:24:12.240]  a racist statement towards Arabs and said my son is it gonna sweep the White
[2:24:12.240 --> 2:24:18.640]  House yeah yeah it's amazing I mean I when I saw it I was just baffled where
[2:24:18.640 --> 2:24:24.920]  did he say that that's in the Jerusalem post it's November 6th like yesterday I
[2:24:24.920 --> 2:24:32.080]  guess what's the headline yeah it's it's just amazing but buddy what is the
[2:24:32.080 --> 2:24:37.160]  point what is the point it's like Gene Simmons I saw a clip of him on his
[2:24:37.160 --> 2:24:43.440]  TV show saying that Gentiles are to are to fix his car and that we're scum I
[2:24:43.440 --> 2:24:50.600]  mean why why act like that do you tell me what bothers me is you have so many
[2:24:50.600 --> 2:24:54.800]  people that totally buy into this stuff people that I used to have civil
[2:24:54.800 --> 2:24:58.360]  conversations with you know friends and acquaintances and all of a sudden they're
[2:24:58.360 --> 2:25:02.240]  all turning you know if you don't like Obama you know you must be you must be
[2:25:02.240 --> 2:25:06.280]  racist somehow you know and there's I don't know why would his father who was a
[2:25:06.280 --> 2:25:11.280]  head terrorist and of course Immanuel's Mossad running the White House openly
[2:25:11.280 --> 2:25:14.280]  along with the head of the Homeland Security and the Attorney General all
[2:25:14.280 --> 2:25:18.720]  all admitted Mossad I mean I understand it's normal to have a farm
[2:25:18.720 --> 2:25:22.880]  country run your nation and I'm gonna make sarcastic but it's horrible but I
[2:25:22.880 --> 2:25:26.960]  mean why make a bizarre statement like that I mean like it's not good enough
[2:25:26.960 --> 2:25:31.480]  for his son to run the country out of the open they don't they don't care I mean
[2:25:31.480 --> 2:25:35.240]  they're openly announcing that you know what does that statement mean that my
[2:25:35.240 --> 2:25:38.160]  son's not an Arab he's not gonna be sweeping the White House that's like a
[2:25:38.160 --> 2:25:43.880]  really vicious attack on Arabs oh yeah that means we're gonna have a man's
[2:25:43.880 --> 2:25:49.400]  background you know he was in the Ergun and this specialty was blowing up different
[2:25:49.400 --> 2:25:54.000]  buildings with people inside of them and they were either Arabs inside of them
[2:25:54.000 --> 2:26:00.360]  or British I mean these people are bloodthirsty Trotskyites that's right
[2:26:00.360 --> 2:26:05.880]  they took over Russia and Stalin kicked them out and they came over here and it's
[2:26:05.880 --> 2:26:11.640]  a particular it's horrible oh god well I mean you know you're I guess you're not
[2:26:11.640 --> 2:26:15.760]  I guess hail Israel and I think it's totally normal for Israel to run the
[2:26:15.760 --> 2:26:22.920]  White House and that's that's the end of it right Bob right they can do what
[2:26:22.920 --> 2:26:27.760]  they want and as far as I'm concerned the Zionists are just another group of
[2:26:27.760 --> 2:26:33.200]  Nazis well actually the Zionists actually funded Hitler and they said don't
[2:26:33.200 --> 2:26:36.560]  and they did a deal to not let me Jews out of Germany unless they paid them a
[2:26:36.560 --> 2:26:40.360]  million dollars in and that was in that day like 50 million to go to Palestine
[2:26:40.360 --> 2:26:46.480]  so nobody that couldn't pay to get out then they didn't get out did they Bob no
[2:26:46.480 --> 2:26:51.600]  and they also Hitler also made a plan for Madagascar as well and I live in
[2:26:51.600 --> 2:26:56.200]  Germany for a number of years and I'm fluent and so you learn a lot of things
[2:26:56.200 --> 2:27:00.640]  you wouldn't otherwise plus having been in counterintelligence I was hooked up
[2:27:00.640 --> 2:27:06.200]  with a lot of people who are in the out there generals who are in the VM out as
[2:27:06.200 --> 2:27:10.640]  well as the SS so I learned lots of things that people don't normally learn
[2:27:10.640 --> 2:27:16.440]  well Bob we're gonna have you back to talk about that hold on we're on the
[2:27:16.440 --> 2:27:26.040]  March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network on
[2:27:26.040 --> 2:27:31.160]  September 11th 2001 along with hundreds of my fellow troops I went to grounds
[2:27:31.160 --> 2:27:34.920]  here up and we knew what to do or at least we thought we did
[2:27:34.920 --> 2:27:39.560]  truth rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a
[2:27:39.560 --> 2:27:47.360]  platform to tell their story Whitman EPA director on the 18 made a statement

[2:29:25.720 --> 2:29:31.200]  hello I'm Steve Shank we're entering a holiday season never before seen in
[2:29:31.200 --> 2:29:35.800]  America we're thankful for the warning given by members of Mr. Obama's campaign
[2:29:35.800 --> 2:29:39.920]  team of the coming international incident which will force unpopular
[2:29:39.920 --> 2:29:44.600]  decisions without this warning many of us who still have money available would
[2:29:44.600 --> 2:29:48.440]  have unknowingly wasted on a Christmas gifts that will be useless when the
[2:29:48.440 --> 2:29:52.320]  only food available isn't a government breadline when the president is faced
[2:29:52.320 --> 2:29:57.320]  with the expected national security incident the in-place patriot legislation
[2:29:57.320 --> 2:30:01.800]  will control transport and distribution of food those of us who are able to take
[2:30:01.800 --> 2:30:05.640]  care of ourselves must put in supplies of food this will free up the relief
[2:30:05.640 --> 2:30:10.040]  organizations to give food to those unable or not smart enough to prepare
[2:30:10.040 --> 2:30:15.400]  the greatest gift this Christmas is life itself food for these unknown times
[2:30:15.400 --> 2:30:25.400]  call 800-409-5633 on the web at eFoodsDirect.com 800-409-5633
[2:30:27.400 --> 2:30:35.400]  day after day day after day alone on a hill alone on a hill
[2:30:35.400 --> 2:30:42.400]  the man with the foolish grin is keeping perfectly still
[2:30:42.400 --> 2:30:49.400]  but nobody wants to know him they can see that he's just a fool
[2:30:49.400 --> 2:30:57.400]  and he never gives an answer but the fool under him sees the sun
[2:30:57.400 --> 2:30:59.400]  Welcome back ladies and gentlemen
[2:30:59.400 --> 2:31:03.400]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts hadn't been on this in about three weeks and I'm going to just take on the election
[2:31:03.400 --> 2:31:06.400]  he was the former editor of the Wall Street Journal
[2:31:06.400 --> 2:31:11.400]  associate editor he was former deputy the number two at the Department of Treasury
[2:31:11.400 --> 2:31:14.400]  he had a policy for Reagan
[2:31:14.400 --> 2:31:19.400]  and Obama is really saying he's pro-New World Order right now pro-globalist
[2:31:19.400 --> 2:31:23.400]  he says he's appointed a chief of staff is the number one gun grabber in the country
[2:31:23.400 --> 2:31:26.400]  it makes Sarah Brady look like an angel cake
[2:31:26.400 --> 2:31:29.400]  record gun sales that's all going on
[2:31:29.400 --> 2:31:34.400]  they swear total carbon taxes bankrupting the coal industry they're going to implement it
[2:31:34.400 --> 2:31:39.400]  Mayor Bloomberg already is saying a huge tax on all plastic bags
[2:31:39.400 --> 2:31:41.400]  taxes on cars all over the country
[2:31:41.400 --> 2:31:44.400]  I mean if you think we're bankrupt now just wait remember the third world countries
[2:31:44.400 --> 2:31:49.400]  they don't have to make carbon cuts it's only us so the factories will leave
[2:31:49.400 --> 2:31:54.400]  I mean the job is bankrupting us the job is getting us into repossession
[2:31:54.400 --> 2:32:01.400]  the job is getting us under their control and not self-sufficient
[2:32:01.400 --> 2:32:03.400]  so it's just amazing
[2:32:03.400 --> 2:32:08.400]  Steve Shank has been in the storeable foods business for 28 years
[2:32:08.400 --> 2:32:13.400]  and he's the owner of, let's say, Michael Stevens Group
[2:32:13.400 --> 2:32:18.400]  EatFoodsDirect.com but I've got him on today for an extended half hour
[2:32:18.400 --> 2:32:23.400]  set at 15 minutes so he joins us every few weeks because I really want to get into
[2:32:23.400 --> 2:32:26.400]  I saw a report this week that wheat was four times what normally is
[2:32:26.400 --> 2:32:30.400]  and you know they're talking about massive hyperinflation kicking in
[2:32:30.400 --> 2:32:35.400]  and wars and all of this regardless I want to hear of somebody who's a mass food preparer
[2:32:35.400 --> 2:32:41.400]  mass food distribution hub, he's a big company
[2:32:41.400 --> 2:32:43.400]  really what's going on behind the scenes
[2:32:43.400 --> 2:32:47.400]  and I've also heard him on ads on Genesis and I want to get his political perspective
[2:32:47.400 --> 2:32:50.400]  because he's been right about a lot of things in the past
[2:32:50.400 --> 2:32:55.400]  talking about not even being able to ship food
[2:32:55.400 --> 2:33:01.400]  never heard him talk like that after the inauguration
[2:33:01.400 --> 2:33:07.400]  and I want to be clear on that because I hope things don't get bad that quick
[2:33:07.400 --> 2:33:11.400]  there's a 10% chance about things happening we should have storeable foods
[2:33:11.400 --> 2:33:15.400]  and firearms and be prepared, guns by themselves folks aren't worth that much
[2:33:15.400 --> 2:33:17.400]  unless you're planning to rob people
[2:33:17.400 --> 2:33:19.400]  you need guns to fin the food
[2:33:19.400 --> 2:33:25.400]  but the media is really upset by this mass arming going on
[2:33:25.400 --> 2:33:27.400]  and they're upset by people getting storeable food
[2:33:27.400 --> 2:33:29.400]  because they want us under their control
[2:33:29.400 --> 2:33:32.400]  they're able to bankrupt us and send the army in as we starve to death
[2:33:32.400 --> 2:33:34.400]  they love it
[2:33:34.400 --> 2:33:36.400]  and so I want to bring up Steve Shank
[2:33:36.400 --> 2:33:38.400]  Steve good to have you here with us
[2:33:38.400 --> 2:33:43.400]  hey it's great to be aboard Alex as usual you're doing the job man
[2:33:43.400 --> 2:33:47.400]  now specifically what are you hearing that's got you so worried about inauguration
[2:33:47.400 --> 2:33:50.400]  well very simply what they're saying
[2:33:50.400 --> 2:33:58.400]  we have world leaders that are cheering the election
[2:33:58.400 --> 2:34:05.400]  and we have world leaders that are in lockstep with Mr. Biden
[2:34:05.400 --> 2:34:11.400]  when he said mark my words there will be a generated crisis
[2:34:11.400 --> 2:34:17.400]  shortly after the election that will challenge our new president
[2:34:17.400 --> 2:34:21.400]  just like they challenged John Kennedy
[2:34:21.400 --> 2:34:26.400]  now we've got all of the Sabre Rattlers all over the world
[2:34:26.400 --> 2:34:28.400]  pointing at nuclear stuff
[2:34:28.400 --> 2:34:31.400]  and what was the Kennedy challenge
[2:34:31.400 --> 2:34:35.400]  it was nuclear and he backed them down
[2:34:35.400 --> 2:34:43.400]  and I don't think that they're going to bring that issue to the fore
[2:34:43.400 --> 2:34:48.400]  unless and make that analogy between Kennedy and Obama
[2:34:48.400 --> 2:34:50.400]  unless there's some meat to it
[2:34:50.400 --> 2:34:52.400]  hold on let's be specific
[2:34:52.400 --> 2:34:56.400]  the Cuban Missile Crisis early 1960s
[2:34:56.400 --> 2:35:02.400]  the blockade of the missiles and the launchers coming in on the Russian ships
[2:35:02.400 --> 2:35:05.400]  and then that's what Bob Chapman said last hour
[2:35:05.400 --> 2:35:07.400]  the International Forecaster or the last segment
[2:35:07.400 --> 2:35:09.400]  he said exactly that
[2:35:09.400 --> 2:35:12.400]  he said his intel they're being pretty obvious Powell and others
[2:35:12.400 --> 2:35:15.400]  is that it will be a blockade of the Strait of Hormuz shutting off oil
[2:35:15.400 --> 2:35:17.400]  which is an act of war against them
[2:35:17.400 --> 2:35:20.400]  they don't have nukes they're not close to nukes so it's a fake crisis
[2:35:20.400 --> 2:35:23.400]  and then that will escalate things in a big way
[2:35:23.400 --> 2:35:26.400]  so Steve independently
[2:35:26.400 --> 2:35:27.400]  I just want to read this
[2:35:27.400 --> 2:35:31.400]  Mullen military is ready to respond to transition terror attack
[2:35:31.400 --> 2:35:33.400]  and their segment chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff said
[2:35:33.400 --> 2:35:35.400]  Wednesday the United States is vulnerable to attack
[2:35:35.400 --> 2:35:37.400]  another incident is during the presidential transition period
[2:35:37.400 --> 2:35:39.400]  the military is ready to respond
[2:35:39.400 --> 2:35:42.400]  so they're acting like somebody's going to attack us
[2:35:42.400 --> 2:35:44.400]  getting everybody ready for it
[2:35:44.400 --> 2:35:47.400]  when clearly it's going to be them staging the attack Steve
[2:35:47.400 --> 2:35:50.400]  well very simply when Mr. Colin Powell
[2:35:50.400 --> 2:35:53.400]  and Madeleine Albright who is
[2:35:53.400 --> 2:35:56.400]  well historically
[2:35:56.400 --> 2:35:59.400]  someone to be reckoned with in these realms
[2:35:59.400 --> 2:36:02.400]  and Mr. Biden all make the statement that
[2:36:02.400 --> 2:36:05.400]  shortly after the inauguration there will be an incident
[2:36:05.400 --> 2:36:08.400]  regarding which
[2:36:08.400 --> 2:36:11.400]  the new president will be forced
[2:36:11.400 --> 2:36:14.400]  to make some unpopular decisions
[2:36:14.400 --> 2:36:17.400]  one of the things about the Patriot Act
[2:36:17.400 --> 2:36:20.400]  is the fact that if there is an incident
[2:36:20.400 --> 2:36:23.400]  it will be required to take over control
[2:36:23.400 --> 2:36:26.400]  of distribution of clothing, medical supplies and food
[2:36:26.400 --> 2:36:29.400]  and this is one of the things that we are concerned with
[2:36:29.400 --> 2:36:32.400]  now we've had a lot of people that
[2:36:32.400 --> 2:36:35.400]  were concerned about getting their food supplies in prior to the election
[2:36:35.400 --> 2:36:37.400]  and one of the things that I
[2:36:37.400 --> 2:36:40.400]  and one of the statements that I tried to get out to them
[2:36:40.400 --> 2:36:43.400]  is don't be concerned about the election be more concerned about the inauguration
[2:36:43.400 --> 2:36:45.400]  just because of these predictions that
[2:36:45.400 --> 2:36:47.400]  insiders have made
[2:36:47.400 --> 2:36:50.400]  that there is going to be something significant happening
[2:36:50.400 --> 2:36:53.400]  I'm not saying it's going to be affecting the food
[2:36:53.400 --> 2:36:55.400]  but so far in my thinking
[2:36:55.400 --> 2:36:58.400]  you know my staff Alex refers to me
[2:36:58.400 --> 2:37:01.400]  as the one trick pony I bring everything back to food
[2:37:01.400 --> 2:37:04.400]  but I got to tell you
[2:37:04.400 --> 2:37:07.400]  it is the only target that I am seeing
[2:37:07.400 --> 2:37:10.400]  in the crosshairs of the
[2:37:10.400 --> 2:37:13.400]  the president administration for example you were mentioning
[2:37:13.400 --> 2:37:16.400]  just before you brought me on
[2:37:16.400 --> 2:37:19.400]  that the coal fuel power plant
[2:37:19.400 --> 2:37:22.400]  industry is virtually going to be bankrupt
[2:37:22.400 --> 2:37:25.400]  because of all of the greenhouse gas
[2:37:25.400 --> 2:37:28.400]  emission taxes and levees
[2:37:28.400 --> 2:37:31.400]  and things like that that will put on it it was a flat out statement
[2:37:31.400 --> 2:37:34.400]  but what a lot of people aren't aware of
[2:37:34.400 --> 2:37:37.400]  is that there are several statements
[2:37:37.400 --> 2:37:40.400]  there is a youtube issue up and there is also
[2:37:40.400 --> 2:37:43.400]  several articles quoting
[2:37:43.400 --> 2:37:46.400]  Mr. Obama
[2:37:46.400 --> 2:37:49.400]  where he says that
[2:37:49.400 --> 2:37:52.400]  the farm industry
[2:37:52.400 --> 2:37:55.400]  has been judged by
[2:37:55.400 --> 2:37:58.400]  their organization or their staff
[2:37:58.400 --> 2:38:01.400]  to actually be more severe in their
[2:38:01.400 --> 2:38:04.400]  greenhouse emissions
[2:38:04.400 --> 2:38:07.400]  than the entire transportation industry
[2:38:07.400 --> 2:38:10.400]  so if the levees and fines
[2:38:10.400 --> 2:38:13.400]  are going to go against coal fuel because of the greenhouse effect
[2:38:13.400 --> 2:38:16.400]  then the farmers
[2:38:16.400 --> 2:38:19.400]  are actually being singled out
[2:38:19.400 --> 2:38:22.400]  as being more dangerous
[2:38:22.400 --> 2:38:25.400]  with regard to these emissions
[2:38:25.400 --> 2:38:28.400]  than the entire transportation industry
[2:38:28.400 --> 2:38:31.400]  what that means is those same fines and levees will go against
[2:38:31.400 --> 2:38:34.400]  the farmers and unless they are
[2:38:34.400 --> 2:38:37.400]  complying with the
[2:38:37.400 --> 2:38:40.400]  announced mandate to increase
[2:38:40.400 --> 2:38:43.400]  by two thirds the mandate to use
[2:38:43.400 --> 2:38:46.400]  our livestock feed
[2:38:46.400 --> 2:38:49.400]  and our food to create ethanol
[2:38:49.400 --> 2:38:52.400]  those farmers will be levied right out of business
[2:38:52.400 --> 2:38:55.400]  along with the coal plants
[2:38:55.400 --> 2:38:58.400]  the hand writing is on the wall the intent has been stated food is
[2:38:58.400 --> 2:39:01.400]  in fact the issue
[2:39:01.400 --> 2:39:04.400]  now with the credit crunch
[2:39:04.400 --> 2:39:07.400]  you put that together farmers we are getting emails all the time
[2:39:07.400 --> 2:39:10.400]  Alex from farmers
[2:39:10.400 --> 2:39:13.400]  and suppliers
[2:39:13.400 --> 2:39:16.400]  the farmers have some of them in areas where they
[2:39:16.400 --> 2:39:19.400]  haven't been hit by the flood and everything like that having bumper crops
[2:39:19.400 --> 2:39:22.400]  they can't sell their crops because
[2:39:22.400 --> 2:39:25.400]  the people the wholesalers that would normally buy them
[2:39:25.400 --> 2:39:28.400]  can't get credit from the banks to buy the farmers crops
[2:39:28.400 --> 2:39:31.400]  the farmers can't
[2:39:31.400 --> 2:39:34.400]  get credit to buy the seed
[2:39:34.400 --> 2:39:37.400]  and so foreign countries are coming in
[2:39:37.400 --> 2:39:40.400]  giving the farmer seeds under the condition that they sell their crops
[2:39:40.400 --> 2:39:43.400]  to the foreign countries so even the bumper crops
[2:39:43.400 --> 2:39:46.400]  that we do have in some areas
[2:39:46.400 --> 2:39:49.400]  often times are being sold out of the country
[2:39:49.400 --> 2:39:52.400]  because the farmers can't get loans
[2:39:52.400 --> 2:39:55.400]  to buy the seed to pay for the fuel
[2:39:55.400 --> 2:39:58.400]  to put the crops in
[2:39:58.400 --> 2:40:01.400]  and then we have the farmers that aren't able to get the loans
[2:40:01.400 --> 2:40:04.400]  to pay for the fuel in order to
[2:40:04.400 --> 2:40:07.400]  to harvest the crops
[2:40:07.400 --> 2:40:10.400]  then the next step down is
[2:40:10.400 --> 2:40:13.400]  the suppliers can't get loans
[2:40:13.400 --> 2:40:16.400]  the wholesalers can't get the loans to buy the food
[2:40:16.400 --> 2:40:19.400]  and the shippers
[2:40:19.400 --> 2:40:22.400]  can't get the loans to transport the food
[2:40:22.400 --> 2:40:25.400]  and the grocery stores can't get loans to stock the shelves
[2:40:25.400 --> 2:40:28.400]  that's why grocery stores
[2:40:28.400 --> 2:40:31.400]  are cutting back on variety and only stocking the things
[2:40:31.400 --> 2:40:34.400]  that they can afford that are cheap
[2:40:34.400 --> 2:40:37.400]  and so it's just going on and on and on so obviously
[2:40:37.400 --> 2:40:40.400]  food is the target Alex
[2:40:40.400 --> 2:40:43.400]  and it's getting more
[2:40:43.400 --> 2:40:46.400]  some of the things that are happening right now
[2:40:46.400 --> 2:40:49.400]  I didn't expect, I did not expect them to come up
[2:40:49.400 --> 2:40:52.400]  with the emissions idea
[2:40:52.400 --> 2:40:55.400]  and I know all of your listeners
[2:40:55.400 --> 2:40:58.400]  realize that this global warming is a pure fabrication
[2:40:58.400 --> 2:41:01.400]  but the fact is that I did not expect them
[2:41:01.400 --> 2:41:04.400]  to come up with the concept
[2:41:04.400 --> 2:41:07.400]  that the farmers are creating
[2:41:07.400 --> 2:41:10.400]  greater greenhouse effect as a result of
[2:41:10.400 --> 2:41:13.400]  their planting and harvesting crops
[2:41:13.400 --> 2:41:16.400]  they're going to tax and regulate
[2:41:16.400 --> 2:41:19.400]  and shut basically everything down
[2:41:19.400 --> 2:41:22.400]  I just went to change.gov
[2:41:22.400 --> 2:41:25.400]  Obama's new transition website
[2:41:25.400 --> 2:41:28.400]  and I'm reading it and it's got a link at the top
[2:41:28.400 --> 2:41:31.400]  America Serves
[2:41:31.400 --> 2:41:34.400]  and it says the Obama administration will call on Americans to serve in order to meet the nation's challenges
[2:41:34.400 --> 2:41:37.400]  President Obama will expand national service programs
[2:41:37.400 --> 2:41:40.400]  like AmeriCorps Peace Corps
[2:41:40.400 --> 2:41:43.400]  classroom corps with the teachers and children
[2:41:43.400 --> 2:41:46.400]  as well as a new health corps, clean energy corps
[2:41:46.400 --> 2:41:48.400]  and veterans corps
[2:41:48.400 --> 2:41:51.400]  Obama will call on citizens of all ages to serve America
[2:41:51.400 --> 2:41:54.400]  but develop a plan to acquire 50 hours of community service in middle schools and high schools
[2:41:54.400 --> 2:41:57.400]  100 hours of community service in college every year
[2:41:57.400 --> 2:42:00.400]  this is national draft
[2:42:00.400 --> 2:42:03.400]  Obama will encourage retiring Americans to serve by improving
[2:42:03.400 --> 2:42:06.400]  available for individuals 55 and it goes on and on
[2:42:06.400 --> 2:42:09.400]  and they admit it's going to be armed spy groups
[2:42:09.400 --> 2:42:12.400]  and the reason I throw this in, in New Orleans and other areas
[2:42:12.400 --> 2:42:15.400]  they shut the food off on purpose, wouldn't let
[2:42:15.400 --> 2:42:18.400]  Walmart or the National Guard even bring the food in
[2:42:18.400 --> 2:42:21.400]  they made them come to the Superdom, they wouldn't let you out of the city
[2:42:21.400 --> 2:42:24.400]  that is one of their weapons of control
[2:42:24.400 --> 2:42:27.400]  and folks, they're not joking
[2:42:27.400 --> 2:42:30.400]  Rahm Emanuel, the new chief of staff, is the head gun grabber in the country
[2:42:30.400 --> 2:42:33.400]  and he says he's coming after our guns
[2:42:33.400 --> 2:42:36.400]  and they're saying they're governors everywhere
[2:42:36.400 --> 2:42:39.400]  mayors everywhere are announcing Schwarzenegger
[2:42:39.400 --> 2:42:42.400]  and Bloomberg are announcing
[2:42:42.400 --> 2:42:44.400]  all these new taxes on us
[2:42:44.400 --> 2:42:47.400]  I mean they are trying to crush us Steve
[2:42:47.400 --> 2:42:50.400]  I know and what you and I have been talking
[2:42:50.400 --> 2:42:53.400]  all along Alex is about this issue
[2:42:53.400 --> 2:42:56.400]  of the only way that families can become independent
[2:42:56.400 --> 2:42:59.400]  or have any hope of maintaining any
[2:42:59.400 --> 2:43:02.400]  modicum of liberty and freedom
[2:43:02.400 --> 2:43:05.400]  is that they are self-reliant and never have to
[2:43:05.400 --> 2:43:08.400]  rely on anybody to feed them
[2:43:08.400 --> 2:43:11.400]  and the main thing that has to happen
[2:43:11.400 --> 2:43:14.400]  you know, every once in a while I get an email
[2:43:14.400 --> 2:43:17.400]  that you and I are trying
[2:43:17.400 --> 2:43:20.400]  to fearmonger in order to sell food
[2:43:20.400 --> 2:43:23.400]  Alex, every morsel of food
[2:43:23.400 --> 2:43:26.400]  that E-Foods direct can get their hands on will go to families
[2:43:26.400 --> 2:43:29.400]  it's not a matter of needing to sell, we just need to get people
[2:43:29.400 --> 2:43:32.400]  we need to get as many people fed
[2:43:32.400 --> 2:43:35.400]  as soon as possible
[2:43:35.400 --> 2:43:38.400]  and one of the things that I needed the extra time today
[2:43:38.400 --> 2:43:41.400]  to announce is that we've come up again this year
[2:43:41.400 --> 2:43:44.400]  with a holiday unit which is $100 less expensive
[2:43:44.400 --> 2:43:47.400]  it's a one year supply for one adult
[2:43:47.400 --> 2:43:50.400]  but it's $100 less expensive than last year's
[2:43:50.400 --> 2:43:53.400]  holiday unit and your listeners practically
[2:43:53.400 --> 2:43:56.400]  covered it up last year but this year
[2:43:56.400 --> 2:43:59.400]  they've got to get food in no matter what
[2:43:59.400 --> 2:44:02.400]  and the way you find out about it is get up on
[2:44:02.400 --> 2:44:04.400]  efoodsdirect.com
[2:44:04.400 --> 2:44:07.400]  we're just posting the new unit
[2:44:07.400 --> 2:44:10.400]  it's going to be $1295
[2:44:10.400 --> 2:44:13.400]  it's cheaper than anything else has been out there
[2:44:13.400 --> 2:44:16.400]  and it's got more food than last year's holiday unit
[2:44:16.400 --> 2:44:19.400]  folks, this is not the time to buy
[2:44:19.400 --> 2:44:22.400]  Chinese toys for your kids
[2:44:22.400 --> 2:44:25.400]  the best investment you can make is in life itself
[2:44:25.400 --> 2:44:28.400]  and the fact is that with what we've got coming Alex
[2:44:28.400 --> 2:44:31.400]  absolutely no question in my mind you know
[2:44:31.400 --> 2:44:34.400]  you and I kind of laugh about the fact that I'm kind of a one trick pony
[2:44:34.400 --> 2:44:37.400]  I keep talking about the same thing
[2:44:37.400 --> 2:44:40.400]  and all of the things that we've talked about
[2:44:40.400 --> 2:44:43.400]  when we've made predictions of what was happening
[2:44:43.400 --> 2:44:46.400]  this isn't prophetic it's just the fact that we're sitting at the supply
[2:44:46.400 --> 2:44:49.400]  end of the food chain and we see what's happening
[2:44:49.400 --> 2:44:52.400]  to our suppliers and the fact is
[2:44:52.400 --> 2:44:55.400]  that the farmers are now starting to respond
[2:44:55.400 --> 2:44:58.400]  and send emails into efoodsdirect saying
[2:44:58.400 --> 2:45:01.400]  hey, let people know what's happening
[2:45:01.400 --> 2:45:04.400]  we can't harvest the crops even if we've got good ones
[2:45:04.400 --> 2:45:07.400]  and the farmers are going to be taxed out of their minds
[2:45:07.400 --> 2:45:10.400]  with this greenhouse they won't be able to feed
[2:45:10.400 --> 2:45:13.400]  they will not be able to grow our food
[2:45:13.400 --> 2:45:16.400]  because of the taxes but they will be given tax free
[2:45:16.400 --> 2:45:19.400]  status if they will shift
[2:45:19.400 --> 2:45:22.400]  all of their production from your food over into
[2:45:22.400 --> 2:45:25.400]  ethanol production Steve
[2:45:25.400 --> 2:45:28.400]  my issue is this
[2:45:28.400 --> 2:45:31.400]  that's a cop out number one we're allowed to have sponsors here
[2:45:31.400 --> 2:45:34.400]  number one you're the longest continually operating storeable food company in the nation
[2:45:34.400 --> 2:45:37.400]  number three the government stores food and weapons and water
[2:45:37.400 --> 2:45:40.400]  in giant facilities and underground bases and warehouses
[2:45:40.400 --> 2:45:43.400]  and they tell us we're kooks if we do
[2:45:43.400 --> 2:45:46.400]  if there's a 10% chance of depression
[2:45:46.400 --> 2:45:49.400]  if there's a 10% chance of war
[2:45:49.400 --> 2:45:52.400]  if there's a 10% chance of depression and warfare
[2:45:52.400 --> 2:45:55.400]  then people should be prepared if there was none of this on the horizon
[2:45:55.400 --> 2:45:58.400]  people should have canned foods and storeable foods
[2:45:58.400 --> 2:46:01.400]  for at least six months that's a cop out
[2:46:01.400 --> 2:46:04.400]  everything I've talked about the FEMA camps
[2:46:04.400 --> 2:46:07.400]  the world banking structure they're announcing
[2:46:07.400 --> 2:46:10.400]  where they create the crisis and then they offer the world banking solution
[2:46:10.400 --> 2:46:13.400]  where you buy your greenhouse credits from them
[2:46:13.400 --> 2:46:16.400]  it's all happening now I don't know if their program or plan
[2:46:16.400 --> 2:46:19.400]  we're fighting to do that we're trying to mobilize the people
[2:46:19.400 --> 2:46:22.400]  as best we can they're finally really paying attention
[2:46:22.400 --> 2:46:25.400]  and that gives me some you know makes me take heart
[2:46:25.400 --> 2:46:28.400]  because you know we've talked about all this happening now it's happening
[2:46:28.400 --> 2:46:31.400]  our credibility just keeps rising so let those that want to live in denial
[2:46:31.400 --> 2:46:34.400]  live in denial and then if we avert all this happening
[2:46:34.400 --> 2:46:37.400]  you know thank god we did our job but regardless
[2:46:37.400 --> 2:46:40.400]  yes people need to get prepared and that's why
[2:46:40.400 --> 2:46:43.400]  when I went out to find a storeable food sponsor because I believe in this
[2:46:43.400 --> 2:46:46.400]  we got you because you're the best out there and you know who I've gotten storeable foods for
[2:46:46.400 --> 2:46:49.400]  going back about eight nine years and they last more than ten years
[2:46:49.400 --> 2:46:52.400]  and climate control ten years if it's out in your garage
[2:46:52.400 --> 2:46:55.400]  your attic and like like like Steve says
[2:46:55.400 --> 2:46:58.400]  if you're not going to get prepared with him get prepared somewhere
[2:46:58.400 --> 2:47:01.400]  and by the firearms by the by the food
[2:47:01.400 --> 2:47:04.400]  and be prepared to use them folks to defend your family this isn't a game
[2:47:04.400 --> 2:47:07.400]  this isn't fun for me to get up here on air Steve
[2:47:07.400 --> 2:47:10.400]  before we go to break and come back and cover more of what you're seeing on the supply
[2:47:10.400 --> 2:47:13.400]  and give people the toll free number
[2:47:13.400 --> 2:47:16.400]  800-409-5633
[2:47:16.400 --> 2:47:19.400]  that's 800-409-5633
[2:47:19.400 --> 2:47:22.400]  and that will get some information
[2:47:22.400 --> 2:47:25.400]  to those of you that aren't computer literate and those of you

[2:47:56.400 --> 2:47:59.400]  that's not going to do anything in a real disaster isn't it Steve?
[2:47:59.400 --> 2:48:02.400]  no it's called a degree of denial
[2:48:02.400 --> 2:48:05.400]  it's so that the media and everyone can say
[2:48:05.400 --> 2:48:07.400]  we told you
[2:48:07.400 --> 2:48:10.400]  but the fact is that they don't tell you enough
[2:48:10.400 --> 2:48:12.400]  yeah it's covering their butt

[2:49:36.400 --> 2:49:37.400]  bin Laden

[2:51:33.400 --> 2:51:37.400]  Steve Shank has talked about the television using hypnotic programming
[2:51:37.400 --> 2:51:39.400]  even Bev Harris picked up on it with Obama
[2:51:39.400 --> 2:51:41.400]  she's an Obama supporter
[2:51:41.400 --> 2:51:43.400]  folks, I can't watch TV now
[2:51:43.400 --> 2:51:45.400]  I catch myself being mesmerized
[2:51:45.400 --> 2:51:48.400]  and it's admitted they're doing it
[2:51:48.400 --> 2:51:52.400]  at the industry level and the public is giggles and laughs
[2:51:52.400 --> 2:51:54.400]  Steve has friends that are in the gun business
[2:51:54.400 --> 2:51:55.400]  they've never seen business like this
[2:51:55.400 --> 2:51:57.400]  but mainstream news says it's the record
[2:51:57.400 --> 2:51:59.400]  everybody's selling out
[2:51:59.400 --> 2:52:03.400]  so folks are finally starting to wake up to what we're facing
[2:52:03.400 --> 2:52:05.400]  Steve, continue
[2:52:05.400 --> 2:52:12.400]  well the main thing that we're dealing with Alex is that
[2:52:12.400 --> 2:52:15.400]  we have a situation, for example
[2:52:15.400 --> 2:52:20.400]  some folks wonder at the fact that we've kind of put a date on things
[2:52:20.400 --> 2:52:23.400]  with Mr. Cole and Powell's statement
[2:52:23.400 --> 2:52:26.400]  we are not putting a date on anything folks
[2:52:26.400 --> 2:52:29.400]  we're not telling you something is going to happen
[2:52:29.400 --> 2:52:32.400]  we're just telling you what these people are saying
[2:52:32.400 --> 2:52:35.400]  and if you've got this Madeline Albright
[2:52:35.400 --> 2:52:38.400]  and you've got Joe Biden
[2:52:38.400 --> 2:52:41.400]  and you've got Colin Powell
[2:52:41.400 --> 2:52:44.400]  at the point where he switched political parties
[2:52:44.400 --> 2:52:48.400]  and denied his allegiance to the military
[2:52:48.400 --> 2:52:51.400]  by going over to the Democratic Party
[2:52:51.400 --> 2:52:56.400]  in an interview on national television
[2:52:56.400 --> 2:53:01.400]  he says that there will be a generated
[2:53:01.400 --> 2:53:06.400]  generated crisis somewhere
[2:53:06.400 --> 2:53:08.400]  you know a crisis that will come along
[2:53:08.400 --> 2:53:10.400]  on the 21st or 22nd
[2:53:10.400 --> 2:53:12.400]  we're not saying that folks
[2:53:12.400 --> 2:53:16.400]  all we're saying is if all of these people who are in the know
[2:53:16.400 --> 2:53:20.400]  are telling us there's something that's going to happen
[2:53:20.400 --> 2:53:22.400]  that we don't know about yet
[2:53:22.400 --> 2:53:25.400]  we have a responsibility to take it serious and get prepared
[2:53:25.400 --> 2:53:29.400]  and people, I mean I got like 3-4 years supply from our whole family
[2:53:29.400 --> 2:53:31.400]  I believe this stuff and all I'm telling you is
[2:53:31.400 --> 2:53:33.400]  if nothing bad happens great, you were prepared
[2:53:33.400 --> 2:53:35.400]  this is like basic insurance
[2:53:35.400 --> 2:53:37.400]  I mean look at this, this is the Washington Times
[2:53:37.400 --> 2:53:39.400]  and I see the military every day now saying
[2:53:39.400 --> 2:53:41.400]  we're going to be hit by terrorists, we're going to be attacked
[2:53:41.400 --> 2:53:43.400]  there's something big, we can't tell you what it is
[2:53:43.400 --> 2:53:46.400]  military is ready to respond to transition terror attack
[2:53:46.400 --> 2:53:49.400]  like somebody would attack the US to get attacked
[2:53:49.400 --> 2:53:51.400]  no, the globalists will stage another terror attack
[2:53:51.400 --> 2:53:54.400]  so they have an excuse to attack more countries
[2:53:54.400 --> 2:53:57.400]  I mean this is, and to make Obama God
[2:53:57.400 --> 2:53:59.400]  he's talking about, he's saying it again
[2:53:59.400 --> 2:54:01.400]  on his presidential site
[2:54:01.400 --> 2:54:04.400]  all these brigades of tattletale squads
[2:54:04.400 --> 2:54:07.400]  I mean God help us and there are so many zombies
[2:54:07.400 --> 2:54:10.400]  see Bush didn't have all this support, he was evil
[2:54:10.400 --> 2:54:12.400]  but he didn't have all this support
[2:54:12.400 --> 2:54:15.400]  Obama has, and you talked about the subliminals
[2:54:15.400 --> 2:54:17.400]  you're seeing it too, Steve Shank?
[2:54:17.400 --> 2:54:20.400]  yeah, there's a tremendous amount of subliminal stuff
[2:54:20.400 --> 2:54:22.400]  that's supposed to be illegal going on
[2:54:22.400 --> 2:54:26.400]  if you look at all the positioning
[2:54:26.400 --> 2:54:31.400]  if you look at the constant repeat
[2:54:31.400 --> 2:54:34.400]  if you get into hypnosis, one of the things that happens
[2:54:34.400 --> 2:54:37.400]  is they have something seven plus or minus two
[2:54:37.400 --> 2:54:40.400]  which means that you confuse the mind, confuse the mind
[2:54:40.400 --> 2:54:43.400]  hit it with enough variables that are shocking
[2:54:43.400 --> 2:54:45.400]  and then you slap them on the forehead
[2:54:45.400 --> 2:54:47.400]  and they go into a trance
[2:54:47.400 --> 2:54:50.400]  what have we had with the stock market going up and down
[2:54:50.400 --> 2:54:53.400]  with the housing market job loss
[2:54:53.400 --> 2:54:56.400]  35, it's now up to 40% of the population right now
[2:54:56.400 --> 2:54:58.400]  when they go to the grocery store, Alex
[2:54:58.400 --> 2:55:01.400]  making a decision as to whether they can afford to buy food
[2:55:01.400 --> 2:55:03.400]  or pay other necessaries
[2:55:03.400 --> 2:55:05.400]  we're going into a catatonic state
[2:55:05.400 --> 2:55:07.400]  while the authorities tell us the economy is great
[2:55:07.400 --> 2:55:09.400]  we're not even in a recession
[2:55:09.400 --> 2:55:12.400]  folks, give the J. Michael Stevens Group a call
[2:55:12.400 --> 2:55:15.400]  get a free brochure, find out more, get their boogie packs
[2:55:15.400 --> 2:55:18.400]  and they've got stoves, water filters, a whole line
[2:55:18.400 --> 2:55:21.400]  of great products at incredibly low prices
[2:55:21.400 --> 2:55:24.400]  and again, we just hope that you get ready
[2:55:24.400 --> 2:55:26.400]  we hope that you get prepared
[2:55:26.400 --> 2:55:28.400]  1-800-409-5633
[2:55:28.400 --> 2:55:30.400]  1-800-409-5633
[2:55:30.400 --> 2:55:32.400]  or eFoodsDirect.com
[2:55:32.400 --> 2:55:34.400]  in closing, Steve
[2:55:34.400 --> 2:55:37.400]  I wish we didn't have to worry about this stuff
[2:55:37.400 --> 2:55:39.400]  but they're certainly getting us ready for something
[2:55:39.400 --> 2:55:42.400]  I would love to be wrong in everything I said to you, Alex
[2:55:42.400 --> 2:55:44.400]  I really would
[2:55:44.400 --> 2:55:46.400]  I would too, Steve
[2:55:46.400 --> 2:55:48.400]  but we'll see if we get the word out enough
[2:55:48.400 --> 2:55:50.400]  and expose them as terrorists and criminals
[2:55:50.400 --> 2:55:53.400]  then maybe they'll back off
[2:55:53.400 --> 2:55:55.400]  and things will be okay, but we'll see
[2:55:55.400 --> 2:55:58.400]  but again, the gun dealers are selling out of firearms
[2:55:58.400 --> 2:56:00.400]  Steve Shank, thanks for coming on with us

[2:57:38.400 --> 2:57:40.400]  of taking over schools and they'll use a shootout
[2:57:40.400 --> 2:57:42.400]  across town to shut down half the schools
[2:57:42.400 --> 2:57:44.400]  and tell the kids terrorists are coming to get them

[2:57:58.400 --> 2:58:00.400]  Nuclear and Explosives Task Force
[2:58:00.400 --> 2:58:02.400]  that means U.S. Army will be there
[2:58:02.400 --> 2:58:04.400]  to coordinate response
[2:58:04.400 --> 2:58:06.400]  That's the cover for the military taking over
[2:58:06.400 --> 2:58:09.400]  Everybody's calling in asking
[2:58:09.400 --> 2:58:12.400]  about Obama's new government transition website
[2:58:12.400 --> 2:58:14.400]  Change.gov
[2:58:14.400 --> 2:58:17.400]  The thing about the American StasiCore is in the top navigation bar
[2:58:17.400 --> 2:58:19.400]  Just read it
[2:58:19.400 --> 2:58:21.400]  I mean I have to like spoon through people are at the office now
[2:58:21.400 --> 2:58:22.400]  where stuff is
[2:58:22.400 --> 2:58:23.400]  Just look at the links
[2:58:23.400 --> 2:58:24.400]  Right at the top
[2:58:24.400 --> 2:58:26.400]  America Serves
[2:58:26.400 --> 2:58:28.400]  America Serves right there
[2:58:28.400 --> 2:58:30.400]  Or just say it doesn't exist
[2:58:30.400 --> 2:58:32.400]  Everything's fine
[2:58:34.400 --> 2:58:35.400]  I got a lot of callers here
[2:58:35.400 --> 2:58:37.400]  I got Dr. Paul Kirk Roberts coming up in the next segment
[2:58:37.400 --> 2:58:38.400]  I want to go to all your calls
[2:58:38.400 --> 2:58:41.400]  But I was telling you I have a 9-11 first responder
[2:58:41.400 --> 2:58:43.400]  What does he want to call himself?
[2:58:43.400 --> 2:58:45.400]  What's his name, John?
[2:58:45.400 --> 2:58:47.400]  So he's John
[2:58:47.400 --> 2:58:49.400]  It says 9-1-1 detective
[2:58:49.400 --> 2:58:50.400]  Whatever that means
[2:58:50.400 --> 2:58:52.400]  Because I wanted police and military to call in about
[2:58:52.400 --> 2:58:54.400]  The open announcement of camps
[2:58:54.400 --> 2:58:56.400]  The open announcement of secret arrest
[2:58:56.400 --> 2:58:58.400]  The open announcement of Stasi forces
[2:58:58.400 --> 2:59:01.400]  They're not just gearing up, they're doing it
[2:59:01.400 --> 2:59:03.400]  So I appreciate you calling in, John
[2:59:03.400 --> 2:59:04.400]  What's on your mind?
[2:59:04.400 --> 2:59:05.400]  Hi Alex
[2:59:05.400 --> 2:59:07.400]  Long time listener
[2:59:07.400 --> 2:59:09.400]  Very much mind
[2:59:09.400 --> 2:59:11.400]  What you are trying to accomplish here
[2:59:11.400 --> 2:59:13.400]  It's just a two-fold thing
[2:59:13.400 --> 2:59:15.400]  That I just wanted to answer
[2:59:15.400 --> 2:59:17.400]  I'm a 9-11 first responder
[2:59:17.400 --> 2:59:19.400]  Actually my base number was 9-11
[2:59:19.400 --> 2:59:20.400]  On 9-11
[2:59:20.400 --> 2:59:22.400]  I don't know if that actually means anything
[2:59:22.400 --> 2:59:24.400]  But you gotta
[2:59:24.400 --> 2:59:25.400]  Me personally
[2:59:25.400 --> 2:59:28.400]  Because I've tried to turn all the cops on to you
[2:59:28.400 --> 2:59:30.400]  But every time they listen
[2:59:30.400 --> 2:59:32.400]  It's this world
[2:59:32.400 --> 2:59:33.400]  A bunch of black boots
[2:59:33.400 --> 2:59:34.400]  Type of guys
[2:59:34.400 --> 2:59:35.400]  No, you're right
[2:59:35.400 --> 2:59:37.400]  I've said over and over again
[2:59:37.400 --> 2:59:39.400]  That I don't try
[2:59:39.400 --> 2:59:41.400]  To win people over
[2:59:41.400 --> 2:59:42.400]  For being friendly
[2:59:42.400 --> 2:59:44.400]  And I'm like that in everything
[2:59:44.400 --> 2:59:46.400]  And it's not as effective as I could be
[2:59:46.400 --> 2:59:48.400]  But I hear about all these stories
[2:59:48.400 --> 2:59:50.400]  About cops arresting people for 9-11 videos
[2:59:50.400 --> 2:59:52.400]  Or I got cops on video coming up saying
[2:59:52.400 --> 2:59:53.400]  Your video camera's a gun
[2:59:53.400 --> 2:59:55.400]  You threaten me with a gun and laughing
[2:59:55.400 --> 2:59:58.400]  And I didn't always say it's not all the cops
[2:59:58.400 --> 3:00:01.400]  I was saying it's the jack-boot element
[3:00:01.400 --> 3:00:02.400]  And believe me
[3:00:02.400 --> 3:00:05.400]  We call them tackle buries
[3:00:05.400 --> 3:00:08.400]  You ever see a police academy tackle buries?
[3:00:08.400 --> 3:00:09.400]  Yes
[3:00:09.400 --> 3:00:10.400]  We have them on the department
[3:00:10.400 --> 3:00:11.400]  There's no doubt about it
[3:00:11.400 --> 3:00:13.400]  They're knuckleheads
[3:00:13.400 --> 3:00:14.400]  They're goofy
[3:00:14.400 --> 3:00:15.400]  There's no doubt about that
[3:00:15.400 --> 3:00:18.400]  But they're not bad people
[3:00:18.400 --> 3:00:19.400]  And tell you the truth
[3:00:19.400 --> 3:00:21.400]  Most cops that you deal with
[3:00:21.400 --> 3:00:24.400]  Now I'm not even like a real pro cop type of guy
[3:00:24.400 --> 3:00:26.400]  I don't carry my gun off duty
[3:00:26.400 --> 3:00:30.400]  I don't walk around with the JCPV
[3:00:30.400 --> 3:00:31.400]  Jersey police department
[3:00:31.400 --> 3:00:33.400]  Sharks on and all that stuff
[3:00:33.400 --> 3:00:34.400]  I mean that's goofy
[3:00:34.400 --> 3:00:35.400]  But at the end of the day
[3:00:35.400 --> 3:00:37.400]  These are good men going to work
[3:00:37.400 --> 3:00:40.400]  And we're not just going to let people
[3:00:40.400 --> 3:00:42.400]  Just come in and do this Alex
[3:00:42.400 --> 3:00:44.400]  Well they're sure trying
[3:00:44.400 --> 3:00:46.400]  Oh yeah they're going to do it
[3:00:46.400 --> 3:00:48.400]  Yeah absolutely I'm on board
[3:00:48.400 --> 3:00:50.400]  With everything that you talk about
[3:00:50.400 --> 3:00:51.400]  Let me just tell you something
[3:00:51.400 --> 3:00:52.400]  Listen
[3:00:52.400 --> 3:00:54.400]  I'll be at Bilderberg covering it
[3:00:54.400 --> 3:00:55.400]  And I got people calling up
[3:00:55.400 --> 3:00:56.400]  Threatening to kill me and my family
[3:00:56.400 --> 3:00:57.400]  So you start flipping out
[3:00:57.400 --> 3:00:58.400]  Okay
[3:00:58.400 --> 3:01:00.400]  And so I start seeing the whole government
[3:01:00.400 --> 3:01:01.400]  As my enemy
[3:01:01.400 --> 3:01:03.400]  I understand it's not everybody in the government
[3:01:03.400 --> 3:01:04.400]  But I mean you know
[3:01:04.400 --> 3:01:06.400]  I mean I've had Austin cops walk up
[3:01:06.400 --> 3:01:08.400]  And say you're not allowed to stand on the street corner
[3:01:08.400 --> 3:01:09.400]  And talk to people
[3:01:09.400 --> 3:01:11.400]  You know and I'm sick of it
[3:01:11.400 --> 3:01:14.400]  But Alex I would be the first one
[3:01:14.400 --> 3:01:16.400]  To say listen everything that you're saying
[3:01:16.400 --> 3:01:18.400]  Is 100% correct
[3:01:18.400 --> 3:01:20.400]  But when you're trying to
[3:01:20.400 --> 3:01:21.400]  When you have law enforcement
[3:01:21.400 --> 3:01:23.400]  Trying to turn people on to what
[3:01:23.400 --> 3:01:24.400]  You're speaking to
[3:01:24.400 --> 3:01:26.400]  And then I mean I'm just
[3:01:26.400 --> 3:01:28.400]  Speaking from my standpoint
[3:01:28.400 --> 3:01:29.400]  I'm trying to turn people on
[3:01:29.400 --> 3:01:30.400]  Every time they turn on
[3:01:30.400 --> 3:01:31.400]  They're like
[3:01:31.400 --> 3:01:33.400]  You know they're referring to us as
[3:01:33.400 --> 3:01:35.400]  Like old winter hooded black boots
[3:01:35.400 --> 3:01:36.400]  Crouch
[3:01:36.400 --> 3:01:38.400]  Well I mean you're not wearing the black boots
[3:01:38.400 --> 3:01:39.400]  Alex I mean you're not
[3:01:39.400 --> 3:01:40.400]  You're not the
[3:01:40.400 --> 3:01:41.400]  Pretty much the weird
[3:01:41.400 --> 3:01:42.400]  Yeah but you're not the
[3:01:42.400 --> 3:01:44.400]  You're not the special weapons attack team
[3:01:48.400 --> 3:01:49.400]  I mean I'm talking about
[3:01:49.400 --> 3:01:50.400]  I'm talking about these cops
[3:01:50.400 --> 3:01:52.400]  And the Denver Post
[3:01:52.400 --> 3:01:54.400]  They admit and I was there
[3:01:54.400 --> 3:01:55.400]  Who were out there starting fights
[3:01:55.400 --> 3:01:57.400]  So they could attack the peaceful protesters
[3:01:57.400 --> 3:01:58.400]  What about them?
[3:02:03.400 --> 3:02:04.400]  Yeah your phone's cutting out
[3:02:04.400 --> 3:02:05.400]  Are you there?
[3:02:07.400 --> 3:02:08.400]  Yes sir you're listening to your radio
[3:02:08.400 --> 3:02:09.400]  Don't hang up
[3:02:09.400 --> 3:02:10.400]  Dr. Roberts is coming up
[3:02:10.400 --> 3:02:11.400]  But I'm gonna come back
[3:02:11.400 --> 3:02:12.400]  And let you finish up
[3:02:12.400 --> 3:02:14.400]  Yeah no I didn't hang up on you sir
[3:02:15.400 --> 3:02:17.400]  Yes I know it's ineffective
[3:02:17.400 --> 3:02:18.400]  I can't help it
[3:02:18.400 --> 3:02:19.400]  See I don't put on an act here
[3:02:19.400 --> 3:02:21.400]  I just tell you what I really think
[3:02:25.400 --> 3:02:27.400]  Hello friends this is Alex Jones
[3:02:27.400 --> 3:02:28.400]  I've told you for a long time
[3:02:28.400 --> 3:02:30.400]  It's important to be self sufficient
[3:02:30.400 --> 3:02:32.400]  And today that's more important than ever
[3:02:32.400 --> 3:02:33.400]  We need to be independent
[3:02:33.400 --> 3:02:35.400]  And food and water is the key
[3:02:35.400 --> 3:02:37.400]  You'll never have to stand in a red line
[3:02:37.400 --> 3:02:38.400]  If you have your own bread
[3:02:38.400 --> 3:02:40.400]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome
[3:02:40.400 --> 3:02:42.400]  And beg for FEMA to take care of your family
[3:02:42.400 --> 3:02:44.400]  In any emergency if you simply prepare
[3:02:44.400 --> 3:02:47.400]  Our elected representatives wanted a good old boy bailout
[3:02:47.400 --> 3:02:48.400]  For the special interest
[3:02:48.400 --> 3:02:50.400]  So they ignored your screams not to do it
[3:02:50.400 --> 3:02:52.400]  They turned off the telephones and emailed
[3:02:52.400 --> 3:02:54.400]  They voted to print $850 billion
[3:02:54.400 --> 3:02:56.400]  At least out of thin air
[3:02:56.400 --> 3:02:59.400]  This money now owns the American and European banks
[3:02:59.400 --> 3:03:01.400]  The exploding inflation that is now guaranteed
[3:03:01.400 --> 3:03:03.400]  Will slash your life savings to nothing
[3:03:03.400 --> 3:03:05.400]  And blast the cost of necessities
[3:03:05.400 --> 3:03:08.400]  Particularly food beyond many Americans reach
[3:03:08.400 --> 3:03:10.400]  In pre-Nazi Germany's super inflation
[3:03:10.400 --> 3:03:13.400]  The cost of a loaf of bread doubled every two days
[3:03:13.400 --> 3:03:15.400]  Until it reached over 4 billion marks
[3:03:15.400 --> 3:03:17.400]  Food prices are skyrocketing so fast
[3:03:17.400 --> 3:03:19.400]  There seems as if there may be no end in sight
[3:03:19.400 --> 3:03:22.400]  The private banks merging with our government
[3:03:22.400 --> 3:03:23.400]  Are refusing to loan grocery stores
[3:03:23.400 --> 3:03:25.400]  Enough money to restock their shelves
[3:03:25.400 --> 3:03:26.400]  The stores have less food
[3:03:26.400 --> 3:03:28.400]  But jack of prices to stay in business
[3:03:28.400 --> 3:03:30.400]  Whatever happens in America
[3:03:30.400 --> 3:03:32.400]  We need to be prepared and be ready
[3:03:32.400 --> 3:03:33.400]  Everything is zeroing in on food
[3:03:33.400 --> 3:03:35.400]  One third of Americans have to choose between
[3:03:35.400 --> 3:03:37.400]  Buying food and paying for other necessities
[3:03:37.400 --> 3:03:39.400]  My friends, whatever it takes
[3:03:39.400 --> 3:03:41.400]  Get prepared, get self-sufficient, get food
[3:03:41.400 --> 3:03:43.400]  For everybody out there listening
[3:03:43.400 --> 3:03:45.400]  It's very important for you to understand that
[3:03:45.400 --> 3:03:46.400]  By having a supply of storable food
[3:03:46.400 --> 3:03:48.400]  The government, the new old order
[3:03:48.400 --> 3:03:49.400]  Has a lot less control over you
[3:03:49.400 --> 3:03:51.400]  And so it's a mindset, a mindset
[3:03:51.400 --> 3:03:53.400]  Of self-sufficiency and preparedness
[3:03:53.400 --> 3:03:55.400]  No one is going to take care of your family
[3:03:55.400 --> 3:03:56.400]  In the final equation but you
[3:03:56.400 --> 3:03:58.400]  You know eFoodsDirect.com
[3:03:58.400 --> 3:04:00.400]  Is still able to ship storable food
[3:04:00.400 --> 3:04:02.400]  That's safe from E. coli, salmonella
[3:04:02.400 --> 3:04:04.400]  Genetic alteration or Chinese imports
[3:04:04.400 --> 3:04:06.400]  And they do it at almost half the cost
[3:04:06.400 --> 3:04:08.400]  Of last year's grocery prices
[3:04:08.400 --> 3:04:10.400]  Call 1-800-409-5633
[3:04:10.400 --> 3:04:12.400]  Or on the web go to eFoodsDirect.com
[3:04:12.400 --> 3:04:14.400]  Visit eFoodsDirect.com
[3:04:14.400 --> 3:04:16.400]  And look over the final list of high quality
[3:04:16.400 --> 3:04:18.400]  Freeze dried and dehydrated foods they have to offer
[3:04:18.400 --> 3:04:20.400]  Watch the free videos
[3:04:20.400 --> 3:04:21.400]  Look at their online catalog
[3:04:21.400 --> 3:04:24.400]  Or give them a call at 1-800-409-5633
[3:04:24.400 --> 3:04:27.400]  Again, 800-409-5633
[3:04:27.400 --> 3:04:29.400]  Or on the web at eFoodsDirect.com
[3:04:29.400 --> 3:04:31.400]  Take action today, the first step
[3:04:31.400 --> 3:04:33.400]  Is getting storable food
[3:04:34.400 --> 3:04:36.400]  From his central Texas command center
[3:04:36.400 --> 3:04:38.400]  Deep behind enemy lines
[3:04:38.400 --> 3:04:41.400]  The information war continues
[3:04:41.400 --> 3:04:45.400]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network
[3:04:45.400 --> 3:04:47.400]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, former editor
[3:04:47.400 --> 3:04:49.400]  At the Wall Street Journal, best-selling author
[3:04:49.400 --> 3:04:50.400]  Head of Policy Department of Treasury
[3:04:50.400 --> 3:04:52.400]  And Ronald Reagan is going to be joining us
[3:04:52.400 --> 3:04:53.400]  In about two minutes
[3:04:53.400 --> 3:04:55.400]  I wanted to go back to John in New Jersey
[3:04:55.400 --> 3:04:57.400]  In 2011, detective
[3:04:57.400 --> 3:05:00.400]  He sponsored Richard Gage, architecture engineer
[3:05:00.400 --> 3:05:02.400]  Now I remember hearing about him
[3:05:02.400 --> 3:05:03.400]  To come in and speak
[3:05:03.400 --> 3:05:05.400]  And he's asking, why do you call us
[3:05:05.400 --> 3:05:07.400]  Jackboot thugs?
[3:05:10.400 --> 3:05:12.400]  He's asking
[3:05:12.400 --> 3:05:14.400]  We're now live at PrismPlanet.tv
[3:05:14.400 --> 3:05:16.400]  I've got to turn the lights on in here
[3:05:16.400 --> 3:05:18.400]  For the camera
[3:05:18.400 --> 3:05:19.400]  He's asking, why do you say that?
[3:05:19.400 --> 3:05:20.400]  I'm talking about a government
[3:05:20.400 --> 3:05:21.400]  That's building FEMA camps
[3:05:21.400 --> 3:05:23.400]  And admitting it in the newspaper
[3:05:23.400 --> 3:05:25.400]  I'm talking about
[3:05:25.400 --> 3:05:26.400]  A government that's saying
[3:05:26.400 --> 3:05:27.400]  We're going to have youth brigades
[3:05:27.400 --> 3:05:29.400]  And tattletale corps
[3:05:29.400 --> 3:05:30.400]  I'm talking about a government
[3:05:30.400 --> 3:05:32.400]  Under social engineering control
[3:05:32.400 --> 3:05:34.400]  That is turning America into a police state
[3:05:34.400 --> 3:05:36.400]  And throwing the bill of rights up the window
[3:05:36.400 --> 3:05:38.400]  In non-terror-related cases
[3:05:38.400 --> 3:05:40.400]  And so the system we're saying
[3:05:40.400 --> 3:05:41.400]  Is a jackbooted
[3:05:41.400 --> 3:05:43.400]  And I mean, in Austin every day
[3:05:43.400 --> 3:05:45.400]  Police take kids from homes without warrants
[3:05:45.400 --> 3:05:47.400]  Without indictments, without due process
[3:05:47.400 --> 3:05:49.400]  And they go, well, I'm just following orders
[3:05:49.400 --> 3:05:51.400]  And I have Austin cops walk up
[3:05:51.400 --> 3:05:53.400]  And say, turn your camera off
[3:05:53.400 --> 3:05:55.400]  Or stop talking on a street corner
[3:05:55.400 --> 3:05:56.400]  You're not allowed to
[3:05:56.400 --> 3:05:57.400]  And I go, but Austin's lost
[3:05:57.400 --> 3:05:58.400]  Hundreds of lawsuits for this
[3:05:58.400 --> 3:05:59.400]  And they say, we don't care
[3:05:59.400 --> 3:06:00.400]  Turn your camera off
[3:06:00.400 --> 3:06:02.400]  Get off the street
[3:06:02.400 --> 3:06:06.400]  You know, so that's who I'm talking about
[3:06:06.400 --> 3:06:09.400]  And that's what I'm discussing
[3:06:09.400 --> 3:06:12.400]  So yes, I need to differentiate better
[3:06:12.400 --> 3:06:15.400]  But the way the police have been organized
[3:06:15.400 --> 3:06:16.400]  The way they're being trained
[3:06:16.400 --> 3:06:20.400]  What's happening in this country
[3:06:20.400 --> 3:06:23.400]  I mean, it's an us against them mentality
[3:06:23.400 --> 3:06:25.400]  They say it's an us against them
[3:06:25.400 --> 3:06:27.400]  And I know they're a lot of good police
[3:06:27.400 --> 3:06:29.400]  And I know that I don't handle it right
[3:06:29.400 --> 3:06:31.400]  When I blanket just spew things
[3:06:31.400 --> 3:06:34.400]  But I mean, I'm freaked out, folks
[3:06:34.400 --> 3:06:37.400]  You know, I'm a straight-laced good guy
[3:06:37.400 --> 3:06:40.400]  And I've had all sorts of stuff done to me
[3:06:40.400 --> 3:06:41.400]  By the police
[3:06:41.400 --> 3:06:43.400]  Now, I've had the Austin police chief in here
[3:06:43.400 --> 3:06:44.400]  And he claims he's a fan of the show
[3:06:44.400 --> 3:06:46.400]  And I know people that know him privately
[3:06:46.400 --> 3:06:48.400]  That he didn't know me
[3:06:48.400 --> 3:06:50.400]  And he talks about me at dinner parties
[3:06:50.400 --> 3:06:52.400]  And at radio stations behind the scenes
[3:06:52.400 --> 3:06:54.400]  And does an Alex Jones imitation
[3:06:54.400 --> 3:06:57.400]  I understand that cops are just normal people
[3:06:57.400 --> 3:06:59.400]  But I'm telling you
[3:06:59.400 --> 3:07:01.400]  The cops and the firemen witness them
[3:07:01.400 --> 3:07:03.400]  Take the black boxes off the pile
[3:07:03.400 --> 3:07:07.400]  The cops, you know, see all this evil going on
[3:07:07.400 --> 3:07:10.400]  And I'm tired of hearing we're just doing our job
[3:07:10.400 --> 3:07:11.400]  And now it's all coming to a head
[3:07:11.400 --> 3:07:13.400]  The foreign banks are looting the country
[3:07:13.400 --> 3:07:16.400]  But finishing up with what you were saying, John
[3:07:16.400 --> 3:07:22.400]  I mean, Alex, the way I'm seeing it now
[3:07:22.400 --> 3:07:27.400]  I had a mandatory evidence collection class
[3:07:27.400 --> 3:07:31.400]  Sponsored by the state troopers
[3:07:31.400 --> 3:07:33.400]  The New Jersey state troopers
[3:07:33.400 --> 3:07:37.400]  And it was given by, I guess you can Google it
[3:07:37.400 --> 3:07:39.400]  His name is Jerry Lewis
[3:07:39.400 --> 3:07:43.400]  And the opening salvo to the class
[3:07:43.400 --> 3:07:48.400]  Was, I think, I believe it was the
[3:07:48.400 --> 3:07:51.400]  Luftwaffe interrogator
[3:07:51.400 --> 3:07:53.400]  The head interrogator
[3:07:53.400 --> 3:07:57.400]  And Han Shrop, I think that was the name
[3:07:57.400 --> 3:07:59.400]  But he gives the opening salvo
[3:07:59.400 --> 3:08:01.400]  It was a two-week class
[3:08:01.400 --> 3:08:03.400]  Now I'm the only one sitting in the class going
[3:08:03.400 --> 3:08:05.400]  What is that?
[3:08:05.400 --> 3:08:07.400]  And then he would take a fan
[3:08:07.400 --> 3:08:12.400]  It wasn't okay, well, we appreciate the technique
[3:08:12.400 --> 3:08:16.400]  It was like a fan of the guy
[3:08:16.400 --> 3:08:18.400]  Now what?
[3:08:18.400 --> 3:08:22.400]  Are we becoming fans of interrogators?
[3:08:22.400 --> 3:08:28.400]  I mean, pilots got shot down after they survived that
[3:08:28.400 --> 3:08:30.400]  Because you never put a hand on them
[3:08:30.400 --> 3:08:33.400]  And this is the kind of thing that you speak to
[3:08:33.400 --> 3:08:34.400]  And I picked up on that right away
[3:08:34.400 --> 3:08:37.400]  My lieutenant told me, listen, just get out of the door
[3:08:37.400 --> 3:08:39.400]  Just go out and have a smoke
[3:08:39.400 --> 3:08:41.400]  Do whatever you gotta do
[3:08:41.400 --> 3:08:44.400]  So he's telling you how great the Nazi interrogators are
[3:08:44.400 --> 3:08:46.400]  Well, listen, I'd like to get you on as a guest
[3:08:46.400 --> 3:08:48.400]  Sometime on the show, okay, John?
[3:08:48.400 --> 3:08:50.400]  Yeah, absolutely
[3:08:50.400 --> 3:08:52.400]  All right, I appreciate it
[3:08:52.400 --> 3:08:56.400]  You know, I've just had police do so much horrible stuff to me
[3:08:56.400 --> 3:08:58.400]  I grew up in Rockwell, Texas
[3:08:58.400 --> 3:09:00.400]  Where the police and the sheriff's department
[3:09:00.400 --> 3:09:03.400]  Delivered the cocaine, the heroin, the marijuana
[3:09:03.400 --> 3:09:04.400]  And I was never into drugs
[3:09:04.400 --> 3:09:06.400]  But I lived in an upper-class neighborhood
[3:09:06.400 --> 3:09:08.400]  You know, upper-middle-class neighborhood
[3:09:08.400 --> 3:09:09.400]  And witnessed the police delivering drugs
[3:09:09.400 --> 3:09:12.400]  And then I'd see the same cops doing drug raids at the school
[3:09:12.400 --> 3:09:16.400]  And I mentioned to them, hey, you know, I was one time at a party
[3:09:16.400 --> 3:09:19.400]  And saw one of you guys delivering drugs there
[3:09:19.400 --> 3:09:21.400]  And they said, we're going to kill you and your family
[3:09:21.400 --> 3:09:23.400]  And we had to move out of that area of Dallas
[3:09:23.400 --> 3:09:27.400]  So, you know, my dad had one of the local lawyers call him
[3:09:27.400 --> 3:09:28.400]  And say, you need to get out here
[3:09:28.400 --> 3:09:32.400]  Your son's going to be hung in a jail cell
[3:09:32.400 --> 3:09:35.400]  And then later, the sheriff, Jack McCorder, went to prison
[3:09:35.400 --> 3:09:38.400]  For flying heroin and cocaine and marijuana
[3:09:38.400 --> 3:09:41.400]  Into the Austin Rockwall Airport
[3:09:41.400 --> 3:09:43.400]  But listen, I got Dr. Roberts holding
[3:09:43.400 --> 3:09:44.400]  I'm going to get into that point
[3:09:44.400 --> 3:09:45.400]  Is I can tell you a million stories
[3:09:45.400 --> 3:09:47.400]  It's in the Denver Post that cops provocateur
[3:09:47.400 --> 3:09:49.400]  Now, we told you that in Denver
[3:09:49.400 --> 3:09:51.400]  Cops dress up, they go hit innocent people
[3:09:51.400 --> 3:09:52.400]  The news cameras catch it
[3:09:52.400 --> 3:09:56.400]  And they use that to then demonize the crowds
[3:09:56.400 --> 3:09:59.400]  Now, we also got reports of Marines dressed up doing that
[3:09:59.400 --> 3:10:00.400]  And we've caught them all
[3:10:00.400 --> 3:10:04.400]  I mean, you know, that's organized crime
[3:10:04.400 --> 3:10:07.400]  Dr. Roberts, how do you explain this to people?
[3:10:07.400 --> 3:10:09.400]  Because you call it jackboot thuggism
[3:10:09.400 --> 3:10:11.400]  We're talking about the system, aren't we?
[3:10:11.400 --> 3:10:13.400]  We're not saying every cop is a jackbooter
[3:10:13.400 --> 3:10:14.400]  I mean, can you answer this question?
[3:10:14.400 --> 3:10:16.400]  Because he says he sends cops to the show
[3:10:16.400 --> 3:10:19.400]  And then it turns them off when I'm talking about that
[3:10:19.400 --> 3:10:26.400]  Right, you know, tyranny turns normal people into thugs
[3:10:26.400 --> 3:10:28.400]  That's what it does
[3:10:28.400 --> 3:10:30.400]  It gives orders
[3:10:30.400 --> 3:10:34.400]  And then you either follow them or you're out of a job
[3:10:34.400 --> 3:10:37.400]  Or they turn on you
[3:10:37.400 --> 3:10:40.400]  And you become the victim
[3:10:40.400 --> 3:10:43.400]  So that's the problem for decent people
[3:10:43.400 --> 3:10:48.400]  Who serve the state when it turns toward tyranny
[3:10:48.400 --> 3:10:51.400]  And as you know, and it pointed out so well
[3:10:51.400 --> 3:10:53.400]  It doesn't happen all at once
[3:10:53.400 --> 3:10:56.400]  It goes step by step
[3:10:56.400 --> 3:10:59.400]  But as you turn to tyranny
[3:10:59.400 --> 3:11:02.400]  It destroys the character of people
[3:11:02.400 --> 3:11:09.400]  Because they have to serve it or go down
[3:11:09.400 --> 3:11:12.400]  It's a slow seduction
[3:11:12.400 --> 3:11:14.400]  It's a slow seduction
[3:11:14.400 --> 3:11:16.400]  Many people won't see it
[3:11:16.400 --> 3:11:19.400]  Won't see it until very late
[3:11:19.400 --> 3:11:21.400]  Others will fool themselves
[3:11:21.400 --> 3:11:25.400]  Others will say, well, to have a good opinion
[3:11:25.400 --> 3:11:29.400]  Of what I'm doing, I have to believe the propaganda
[3:11:29.400 --> 3:11:34.400]  That these people, we are brutalizing, really are enemies
[3:11:34.400 --> 3:11:36.400]  They really are terrorists
[3:11:36.400 --> 3:11:40.400]  Demonstrators are unpatriotic and anti-American
[3:11:40.400 --> 3:11:44.400]  So a lot of people just have to believe that
[3:11:44.400 --> 3:11:48.400]  They believe they come to terms with propaganda
[3:11:48.400 --> 3:11:52.400]  In order to continue in the job
[3:11:52.400 --> 3:12:00.400]  This happens wherever there's tyranny
[3:12:00.400 --> 3:12:04.400]  You had hoped that Barack Obama, Dr. Roberts
[3:12:04.400 --> 3:12:06.400]  Would do some of the things he said eight, nine months ago
[3:12:06.400 --> 3:12:09.400]  Now we're calling him Neocon Obama
[3:12:09.400 --> 3:12:13.400]  Who he's appointing, what he's doing, what he's saying
[3:12:13.400 --> 3:12:16.400]  The carbon tax alone will destroy the country
[3:12:16.400 --> 3:12:20.400]  Record gun sales, though
[3:12:20.400 --> 3:12:25.400]  Well, you know, he had to be elected
[3:12:25.400 --> 3:12:30.400]  Because the Republicans
[3:12:30.400 --> 3:12:33.400]  It's the only way to hold the Republicans accountable
[3:12:33.400 --> 3:12:37.400]  I mean, we can't simply let the Republicans
[3:12:37.400 --> 3:12:41.400]  Escape accountability for their crimes against the Constitution
[3:12:41.400 --> 3:12:44.400]  And human rights for their violations of U.S.
[3:12:44.400 --> 3:12:47.400]  And international laws for their lives and dissections
[3:12:47.400 --> 3:12:49.400]  And all their financial crookedness
[3:12:49.400 --> 3:12:53.400]  We can't just reelect them and say, well, you know
[3:12:53.400 --> 3:12:56.400]  We forgive you for all those crimes
[3:12:56.400 --> 3:12:59.400]  Concentration camps and police state and all the rest
[3:12:59.400 --> 3:13:00.400]  So he had to be elected
[3:13:00.400 --> 3:13:03.400]  Because it's the only way the people can hold him
[3:13:03.400 --> 3:13:05.400]  Can hold the Republicans accountable
[3:13:05.400 --> 3:13:06.400]  But the establishment
[3:13:06.400 --> 3:13:11.400]  And that's the only reason I ever supported the Democrats
[3:13:11.400 --> 3:13:12.400]  Or Obama
[3:13:12.400 --> 3:13:17.400]  You know, it's propped to put it after the election
[3:13:17.400 --> 3:13:20.400]  An editorial and propped to the Russian newspaper
[3:13:20.400 --> 3:13:23.400]  The old Soviet newspaper
[3:13:23.400 --> 3:13:25.400]  Here's what they said
[3:13:25.400 --> 3:13:29.400]  Only Satan would have been worse than the Bush regime
[3:13:29.400 --> 3:13:35.400]  Therefore, it could be argued that the new administration
[3:13:35.400 --> 3:13:38.400]  In the USA could never be worse than the one
[3:13:38.400 --> 3:13:41.400]  Which divorced the hearts and minds of Americans
[3:13:41.400 --> 3:13:45.400]  From their brothers in the international community
[3:13:45.400 --> 3:13:50.400]  Which appalled the rest of the world with shocking old tactics
[3:13:50.400 --> 3:13:54.400]  That included concentration camps, torture, mass murder
[3:13:54.400 --> 3:13:57.400]  And uttered disrespect for international law
[3:13:57.400 --> 3:14:01.400]  Well, that, if we didn't hold the Republicans accountable
[3:14:01.400 --> 3:14:03.400]  For that, what would the world think of it?
[3:14:03.400 --> 3:14:06.400]  No, I understand, but now Obama has shown
[3:14:06.400 --> 3:14:08.400]  That he's going to kick it into high gear
[3:14:08.400 --> 3:14:10.400]  Well, I'm not surprised
[3:14:10.400 --> 3:14:13.400]  You can't, you know
[3:14:13.400 --> 3:14:15.400]  Obama's a showman
[3:14:15.400 --> 3:14:18.400]  And his victory speech was magnificent
[3:14:18.400 --> 3:14:23.400]  And the cameras panning all the, you know, scanning the faces
[3:14:23.400 --> 3:14:26.400]  And the audience, you could see the hope and the belief
[3:14:26.400 --> 3:14:32.400]  In people's faces that propelled him to the presidency
[3:14:32.400 --> 3:14:35.400]  But he can't bring change to Washington
[3:14:35.400 --> 3:14:36.400]  Who can he appoint?
[3:14:36.400 --> 3:14:39.400]  There's nobody in the Washington crowd
[3:14:39.400 --> 3:14:42.400]  Capable of bringing change
[3:14:42.400 --> 3:14:45.400]  It's the same crowd, you know
[3:14:45.400 --> 3:14:49.400]  All the Clinton retrets will be there
[3:14:49.400 --> 3:14:51.400]  The people who bombed Serbia
[3:14:51.400 --> 3:14:53.400]  And committed war crimes in Serbia
[3:14:53.400 --> 3:14:57.400]  Robert Rubin, the Clinton Secretary of the Treasury
[3:14:57.400 --> 3:14:59.400]  Who got Glass-Steagall repeal
[3:14:59.400 --> 3:15:01.400]  And is responsible as much as anybody
[3:15:01.400 --> 3:15:03.400]  For the current financial crisis
[3:15:03.400 --> 3:15:04.400]  Yes
[3:15:04.400 --> 3:15:06.400]  Holbrook, Dennis Ross
[3:15:06.400 --> 3:15:09.400]  These are all the criminals of the Clinton administration
[3:15:09.400 --> 3:15:13.400]  And they'll now simply be recycled in the government
[3:15:13.400 --> 3:15:19.400]  And even if Obama knew anyone capable of helping him bring change
[3:15:19.400 --> 3:15:22.400]  He wouldn't be able to get them confirmed by the Senate
[3:15:22.400 --> 3:15:24.400]  Well, his two billion bucks
[3:15:24.400 --> 3:15:25.400]  His two billion
[3:15:25.400 --> 3:15:29.400]  The powerful interest groups would go in and block the appointment
[3:15:29.400 --> 3:15:33.400]  So Washington, the only way you ever get changed in Washington
[3:15:33.400 --> 3:15:35.400]  Is a revolution
[3:15:35.400 --> 3:15:37.400]  I think what's going to bring change
[3:15:37.400 --> 3:15:40.400]  Is not the election of Obama
[3:15:40.400 --> 3:15:43.400]  It's the fact that the United States
[3:15:43.400 --> 3:15:45.400]  Has run out of money
[3:15:45.400 --> 3:15:48.400]  And run out of credibility
[3:15:48.400 --> 3:15:50.400]  And has annoyed the world
[3:15:50.400 --> 3:15:54.400]  And the world is organizing against us
[3:15:54.400 --> 3:15:57.400]  We see the statements out of China
[3:15:57.400 --> 3:15:58.400]  Out of Russia
[3:15:58.400 --> 3:15:59.400]  Out of India
[3:15:59.400 --> 3:16:00.400]  Out of Brazil
[3:16:00.400 --> 3:16:01.400]  Out of Venezuela
[3:16:01.400 --> 3:16:04.400]  Out of Germany even
[3:16:04.400 --> 3:16:09.400]  They want a different kind of international community
[3:16:09.400 --> 3:16:12.400]  In which America isn't the ruler
[3:16:12.400 --> 3:16:15.400]  It's just a member of the community
[3:16:15.400 --> 3:16:18.400]  Alright, we're going to be right back, Dr. Roberts
[3:16:18.400 --> 3:16:19.400]  We're going to be right back
[3:16:19.400 --> 3:16:22.400]  We've got two more segments with you today
[3:16:22.400 --> 3:16:23.400]  And when we get back
[3:16:23.400 --> 3:16:26.400]  I want to talk about Obama
[3:16:26.400 --> 3:16:28.400]  And some of the new policies he's pushing
[3:16:28.400 --> 3:16:32.400]  Because it's bad
[3:16:32.400 --> 3:16:35.400]  But John, let's skip this break
[3:16:35.400 --> 3:16:39.400]  Dr. Roberts
[3:16:39.400 --> 3:16:41.400]  Dr. Roberts for the Internet audience
[3:16:41.400 --> 3:16:42.400]  We're not on AM and FM
[3:16:42.400 --> 3:16:44.400]  I want to keep talking here
[3:16:44.400 --> 3:16:45.400]  So we're still on the radio
[3:16:45.400 --> 3:16:47.400]  Yeah, look, I'm not attacking you saying
[3:16:47.400 --> 3:16:49.400]  Oh, you were saying maybe Obama's good
[3:16:49.400 --> 3:16:54.400]  I mean, obviously we couldn't on paper
[3:16:54.400 --> 3:16:56.400]  Say, well, let's just go for John McCain
[3:16:56.400 --> 3:17:00.400]  Because worldwide that would have been seen
[3:17:00.400 --> 3:17:02.400]  As a national endorsement of the neocons
[3:17:02.400 --> 3:17:07.400]  But now they're bringing in the slicker neocons
[3:17:07.400 --> 3:17:10.400]  I mean, people who are literally
[3:17:10.400 --> 3:17:12.400]  From the very, very same crowd
[3:17:12.400 --> 3:17:15.400]  I mean, his new chief of staff alone
[3:17:15.400 --> 3:17:18.400]  Is just an absolute nightmare
[3:17:18.400 --> 3:17:21.400]  And so we have all of that going on
[3:17:21.400 --> 3:17:23.400]  And then you talk about credibility
[3:17:23.400 --> 3:17:25.400]  If McCain would have come in
[3:17:25.400 --> 3:17:27.400]  Internationally and nationally
[3:17:27.400 --> 3:17:30.400]  He would have had no credibility
[3:17:30.400 --> 3:17:35.400]  And so now that he's in there
[3:17:35.400 --> 3:17:37.400]  He has been able to
[3:17:37.400 --> 3:17:39.400]  Yeah, exactly, he has been able to mesmerize
[3:17:39.400 --> 3:17:41.400]  Get more credibility internationally
[3:17:41.400 --> 3:17:42.400]  And now he's saying, okay
[3:17:42.400 --> 3:17:44.400]  We got some big event coming up
[3:17:44.400 --> 3:17:46.400]  The 21st, 22nd, okay
[3:17:46.400 --> 3:17:47.400]  We're going to go ahead and get tough
[3:17:47.400 --> 3:17:49.400]  When I ran in Russia, okay
[3:17:49.400 --> 3:17:51.400]  We're going to do all these things
[3:17:51.400 --> 3:17:53.400]  Okay, I'm going to appoint a bunch of Israelis
[3:17:53.400 --> 3:17:55.400]  And other people to my cabinet
[3:17:55.400 --> 3:17:58.400]  Right, right
[3:17:58.400 --> 3:18:02.400]  But they're not going to be able to get tough
[3:18:02.400 --> 3:18:06.400]  Because they ain't got any money
[3:18:06.400 --> 3:18:08.400]  And they got a bad recession
[3:18:08.400 --> 3:18:12.400]  I mean, it's really going to be bad
[3:18:12.400 --> 3:18:16.400]  So what's this about guns?
[3:18:16.400 --> 3:18:20.400]  Ron Israel, Emmanuel wants to take our guns already, huh?
[3:18:20.400 --> 3:18:21.400]  Well, you know, he was the guy
[3:18:21.400 --> 3:18:23.400]  That got the Assoluban's band passed in 94
[3:18:23.400 --> 3:18:25.400]  And he spearheaded NAFTA
[3:18:25.400 --> 3:18:27.400]  And yeah, all over the news
[3:18:27.400 --> 3:18:29.400]  Handgun control link and others are saying
[3:18:29.400 --> 3:18:31.400]  Yes, we're going to push for quote
[3:18:31.400 --> 3:18:32.400]  Sensible gun control
[3:18:32.400 --> 3:18:35.400]  And sensible to them is banning all sorts
[3:18:35.400 --> 3:18:38.400]  Of rifles, more registration
[3:18:38.400 --> 3:18:40.400]  Just a whole new raft of gun grabbing
[3:18:40.400 --> 3:18:42.400]  And so now national gun sales
[3:18:42.400 --> 3:18:44.400]  Have broken their all-time records
[3:18:44.400 --> 3:18:46.400]  According to the New York Times
[3:18:46.400 --> 3:18:51.400]  That surprised me
[3:18:51.400 --> 3:18:53.400]  I mean, there are people in the New York Times
[3:18:53.400 --> 3:18:57.400]  Saying, if I can pull the article up if you'd like
[3:18:57.400 --> 3:19:00.400]  Saying, you know, he wants a youth brigade
[3:19:00.400 --> 3:19:01.400]  He wants a domestic Stasi
[3:19:01.400 --> 3:19:03.400]  And then I went to change.gov
[3:19:03.400 --> 3:19:05.400]  His new transition website
[3:19:05.400 --> 3:19:06.400]  And it's in there
[3:19:06.400 --> 3:19:08.400]  They say environmental brigades
[3:19:08.400 --> 3:19:10.400]  Brigades in the schools
[3:19:10.400 --> 3:19:11.400]  It says turning the kids into
[3:19:11.400 --> 3:19:13.400]  I mean, I can read it to you right now
[3:19:13.400 --> 3:19:15.400]  His national service
[3:19:15.400 --> 3:19:17.400]  We're going to have domestic spy forces
[3:19:17.400 --> 3:19:19.400]  Environmental enforcers
[3:19:19.400 --> 3:19:21.400]  We're going to bankrupt the coal industry
[3:19:21.400 --> 3:19:24.400]  We're going to have plastic bag taxes
[3:19:24.400 --> 3:19:28.400]  I mean, they're coming
[3:19:28.400 --> 3:19:32.400]  Well, all that may be disappointed
[3:19:32.400 --> 3:19:35.400]  I mean, you know, they've got their crazy groups
[3:19:35.400 --> 3:19:37.400]  Just like we do
[3:19:37.400 --> 3:19:40.400]  But the moment they got two wars
[3:19:40.400 --> 3:19:43.400]  Maybe two more
[3:19:43.400 --> 3:19:47.400]  Because they keep blowing up things in Pakistan
[3:19:47.400 --> 3:19:50.400]  And now they've crossed Syria's border
[3:19:50.400 --> 3:19:53.400]  And they've still gone all about Iran
[3:19:53.400 --> 3:19:55.400]  In Georgia
[3:19:55.400 --> 3:19:57.400]  They got no money
[3:19:57.400 --> 3:20:01.400]  They got to either print it or borrow it
[3:20:01.400 --> 3:20:04.400]  Nobody's going to lend it to them
[3:20:04.400 --> 3:20:08.400]  They've got the highest unemployment in a long, long time
[3:20:08.400 --> 3:20:10.400]  And it's not even measured accurately
[3:20:10.400 --> 3:20:13.400]  Really, the unemployment rate now is
[3:20:13.400 --> 3:20:16.400]  I would say it's at least 15%
[3:20:16.400 --> 3:20:20.400]  It's measured the way we measured it during the Reagan years
[3:20:20.400 --> 3:20:23.400]  You see, Clinton stopped counting
[3:20:23.400 --> 3:20:26.400]  Discouraged workers as unemployed
[3:20:26.400 --> 3:20:28.400]  Alright, we're coming back to the full audience
[3:20:28.400 --> 3:20:30.400]  Let's talk about that right now
[3:20:30.400 --> 3:20:32.400]  Here we go
[3:20:40.400 --> 3:20:43.400]  His book is out at stores nationwide right now
[3:20:43.400 --> 3:20:46.400]  The tyranny of good intentions
[3:20:50.400 --> 3:20:54.400]  And we're talking to Dr. Paul Craig Roberts today
[3:20:54.400 --> 3:20:56.400]  Continuing with the discussion of the economy
[3:20:56.400 --> 3:20:59.400]  As the former head of the Treasury had a policy
[3:20:59.400 --> 3:21:01.400]  Where is the economy really right now
[3:21:01.400 --> 3:21:03.400]  Versus the mainstream corporate press saying
[3:21:03.400 --> 3:21:06.400]  That we're not really in a recession yet
[3:21:06.400 --> 3:21:09.400]  And using all of this cooking of books
[3:21:09.400 --> 3:21:11.400]  And then they added question
[3:21:11.400 --> 3:21:14.400]  Were they more honest in the past
[3:21:14.400 --> 3:21:16.400]  About unemployment and recession and things
[3:21:16.400 --> 3:21:18.400]  They still cooked at some
[3:21:18.400 --> 3:21:21.400]  And then why do they just lie so much about that now
[3:21:21.400 --> 3:21:24.400]  It would seem to me, reading Joseph Goebbels on propaganda
[3:21:24.400 --> 3:21:28.400]  He said that sometimes too big a lie is too long
[3:21:28.400 --> 3:21:30.400]  You know, once people know it's a lie
[3:21:30.400 --> 3:21:35.400]  It discredits you, so it's better to tell some truth
[3:21:35.400 --> 3:21:41.400]  Well, what they did with the employment and inflation statistics
[3:21:41.400 --> 3:21:46.400]  Is that over time each administration monkey
[3:21:46.400 --> 3:21:49.400]  Whether it's a little bit to make themselves look better
[3:21:49.400 --> 3:21:54.400]  And any particular change didn't have much effect
[3:21:54.400 --> 3:22:00.400]  But over 30 years they become cumulative
[3:22:00.400 --> 3:22:02.400]  And big effects and the biggest things
[3:22:02.400 --> 3:22:05.400]  Happened in the Clinton administration
[3:22:05.400 --> 3:22:06.400]  Now he did two things
[3:22:06.400 --> 3:22:10.400]  One, he ceased, well I can't say he
[3:22:10.400 --> 3:22:15.400]  But the government, during Clinton's administration
[3:22:15.400 --> 3:22:20.400]  Ceased to count discouraged workers as unemployed
[3:22:20.400 --> 3:22:23.400]  If you're not actively seeking for a job
[3:22:23.400 --> 3:22:26.400]  You're not considered in the labor force
[3:22:26.400 --> 3:22:30.400]  And therefore if you're discouraged and said
[3:22:30.400 --> 3:22:32.400]  Well, I've been trying to get a job for five years
[3:22:32.400 --> 3:22:34.400]  And can't get one and I'm just saying
[3:22:34.400 --> 3:22:38.400]  Oh, I'm giving up, they don't count you anymore
[3:22:38.400 --> 3:22:43.400]  And what they did to inflation
[3:22:43.400 --> 3:22:46.400]  They changed the way they measure it
[3:22:46.400 --> 3:22:53.400]  Such that comparisons of pre-Clinton and post-Clinton
[3:22:53.400 --> 3:22:57.400]  Aren't possible because what Clinton did
[3:22:57.400 --> 3:23:02.400]  In order to cheat the Social Security recipients
[3:23:02.400 --> 3:23:07.400]  Whose retirement checks were indexed to inflation
[3:23:07.400 --> 3:23:10.400]  They wanted to hold down those payments
[3:23:10.400 --> 3:23:15.400]  So they rigged the CPI to understate inflation
[3:23:15.400 --> 3:23:19.400]  And one of the ways they did that was, for example
[3:23:19.400 --> 3:23:22.400]  If the price of state goes up in the index
[3:23:22.400 --> 3:23:25.400]  Of all the weighted commodities in the basket of goods
[3:23:25.400 --> 3:23:28.400]  That they're measuring, price of state goes up
[3:23:28.400 --> 3:23:32.400]  It doesn't reflect anymore as inflationary
[3:23:32.400 --> 3:23:36.400]  They simply assume people don't buy state, they buy hamburger
[3:23:36.400 --> 3:23:38.400]  So anytime the price of something goes up
[3:23:38.400 --> 3:23:44.400]  They assume people switch to something to a cheaper substitute
[3:23:44.400 --> 3:23:47.400]  So the basket of goods is not constant
[3:23:47.400 --> 3:23:49.400]  So you don't even know what you're measuring anymore
[3:23:49.400 --> 3:23:53.400]  And you were saying unemployment's really at about 15% right now
[3:23:53.400 --> 3:24:00.400]  John Williams, a statistician who measures the unemployment rate
[3:24:00.400 --> 3:24:04.400]  The way it was traditionally measured by government
[3:24:04.400 --> 3:24:10.400]  Prior to these changes has it at about 15%
[3:24:10.400 --> 3:24:15.400]  And the inflation rate is around 14%
[3:24:15.400 --> 3:24:18.400]  So already these are terrible
[3:24:18.400 --> 3:24:20.400]  This is a terrible situation
[3:24:20.400 --> 3:24:28.400]  And of course, since the inflation rate is so understated
[3:24:28.400 --> 3:24:32.400]  The one that the government uses now
[3:24:32.400 --> 3:24:38.400]  It makes it look like you've got real gross domestic product growth
[3:24:38.400 --> 3:24:43.400]  But John Williams points out that when you measure inflation
[3:24:43.400 --> 3:24:47.400]  The way it was measured in the Reagan years
[3:24:47.400 --> 3:24:54.400]  You don't have any, we've been in a recession since 2006
[3:24:54.400 --> 3:25:00.400]  Because by understating the inflation
[3:25:00.400 --> 3:25:03.400]  Any kind of GDP growth looks real
[3:25:03.400 --> 3:25:06.400]  But if you put the real measure inflation in there
[3:25:06.400 --> 3:25:11.400]  There's no increase in real growth since 2006
[3:25:11.400 --> 3:25:14.400]  So we've been in a recession for two years already
[3:25:14.400 --> 3:25:17.400]  And we'll talk to another topic and then we'll go back into the economy
[3:25:17.400 --> 3:25:20.400]  Where you see it going in the final segment coming up
[3:25:20.400 --> 3:25:23.400]  What is this big, I'm asking all the experts we have on
[3:25:23.400 --> 3:25:26.400]  What is this big international crisis at the head of the navy
[3:25:26.400 --> 3:25:29.400]  And the head of the army and Joe Biden and Colin Powell
[3:25:29.400 --> 3:25:32.400]  All say it's coming on the 21st and 22nd
[3:25:32.400 --> 3:25:34.400]  But they can't and won't tell us what it is
[3:25:34.400 --> 3:25:37.400]  But they know, a lot of our experts are saying
[3:25:37.400 --> 3:25:40.400]  They're going to launch some type of embargo against Iran
[3:25:40.400 --> 3:25:42.400]  Or Israel's going to threaten to go ahead and attack
[3:25:42.400 --> 3:25:45.400]  Or may go ahead and attack, first we said it was off the table
[3:25:45.400 --> 3:25:47.400]  But now it's back on the table
[3:25:47.400 --> 3:25:50.400]  Or is it the new Bretton Woods dollar devaluation
[3:25:50.400 --> 3:25:52.400]  Or new global currency?
[3:25:52.400 --> 3:25:54.400]  What are you hearing, sir?
[3:25:54.400 --> 3:25:57.400]  Well, I don't know what exactly you're talking about
[3:25:57.400 --> 3:26:00.400]  But supposedly on the 15th of November
[3:26:00.400 --> 3:26:06.400]  There's supposed to be an international economic summit
[3:26:06.400 --> 3:26:10.400]  Because European allies have demanded a change
[3:26:10.400 --> 3:26:12.400]  In the international financial...
[3:26:12.400 --> 3:26:15.400]  Stay there, Dr. Roberts, let's come back and talk about that
[3:26:15.400 --> 3:26:19.400]  On the other side of this quick break with Dr. Paul Craig Roberts
[3:26:19.400 --> 3:26:44.400]  Drinking a chlorophyll rich beverage has been found to benefit your entire body
[3:26:44.400 --> 3:26:50.400]  Green shield helps neutralize acid in your body and maintains a healthy pH balance
[3:26:50.400 --> 3:26:54.400]  And having the proper pH balance has been known to balance blood sugar levels
[3:26:54.400 --> 3:26:56.400]  Something we can all benefit from
[3:26:56.400 --> 3:27:00.400]  Green shield combines the perfect blend of powerful whole food vegetables
[3:27:00.400 --> 3:27:02.400]  Immune boosting herbs and grasses
[3:27:02.400 --> 3:27:05.400]  Green shield does not contain algae, mushrooms or fungi
[3:27:05.400 --> 3:27:07.400]  Has no preservatives, artificial colors or flavors
[3:27:07.400 --> 3:27:10.400]  The powder mixes easily with water and tastes great
[3:27:10.400 --> 3:27:14.400]  Drinking green shield strengthens the immune system and boosts energy
[3:27:14.400 --> 3:27:16.400]  Relieves fatigue and stress without the use of stimulants

[3:27:33.400 --> 3:27:40.400]  The day unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country
[3:27:40.400 --> 3:27:42.400]  The enemy struck America on September 11th
[3:27:42.400 --> 3:27:44.400]  But who is the enemy?
[3:27:44.400 --> 3:27:45.400]  Bin Laden
[3:27:45.400 --> 3:27:46.400]  This is his MO
[3:27:46.400 --> 3:27:49.400]  We have to look to the Middle East, we have to look to Osama Bin Laden
[3:27:49.400 --> 3:27:56.400]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States
[3:27:56.400 --> 3:28:03.400]  Some US investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the US
[3:28:03.400 --> 3:28:07.400]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained
[3:28:07.400 --> 3:28:09.400]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA
[3:28:09.400 --> 3:28:11.400]  The hijackers ties to the FBI
[3:28:11.400 --> 3:28:12.400]  The Saudi Arabian connection
[3:28:12.400 --> 3:28:14.400]  The Israeli intelligence network
[3:28:14.400 --> 3:28:15.400]  Warnings and war games
[3:28:15.400 --> 3:28:16.400]  The shadow government
[3:28:16.400 --> 3:28:17.400]  And much, much more

[3:28:33.400 --> 3:28:42.400]  Did you know that it's a documented fact 80% of all Americans and 85% of people around the world suffer from internal parasites and parasitic infection?
[3:28:42.400 --> 3:28:50.400]  You may be one of millions of people suffering from one of dozens of debilitating chronic diseases from these parasites and your doctor would never know it
[3:28:50.400 --> 3:28:55.400]  In fact, clinically detected parasites account for only 1% of all cases
[3:28:55.400 --> 3:28:58.400]  Don't continue to suffer from pain due to misdiagnosis
[3:28:58.400 --> 3:29:02.400]  Now you can fight internal parasites, heavy metal poisoning, and high cholesterol

[3:29:32.400 --> 3:29:42.400]  Music plays
[3:29:42.400 --> 3:29:48.400]  In 1814 we took a little trip along the Colonel Jackson down to mighty Mississippi
[3:29:48.400 --> 3:29:53.400]  We took a little bacon and we took a little beans and we caught the bloody British in a town in New Orleans
[3:29:53.400 --> 3:29:54.400]  We fired our guns and the...
[3:29:54.400 --> 3:29:56.400]  Alright, final second with Dr. Paul Craig Roberts
[3:29:56.400 --> 3:29:57.400]  Appreciate him joining us today
[3:29:57.400 --> 3:29:59.400]  Take some final phone calls at the end of the show
[3:29:59.400 --> 3:30:01.400]  Cover some other news we haven't gotten to
[3:30:01.400 --> 3:30:04.400]  I'm going to cover the economy a little bit after he leaves us
[3:30:04.400 --> 3:30:07.400]  Here's Bill Gertz today, Washington Times
[3:30:07.400 --> 3:30:10.400]  Mullen, military is ready to respond to transition terror attack
[3:30:10.400 --> 3:30:12.400]  They believe Al Qaeda or other countries
[3:30:12.400 --> 3:30:14.400]  You can read all his quotes here
[3:30:14.400 --> 3:30:15.400]  It's up on infowars.com
[3:30:15.400 --> 3:30:18.400]  We have a link saying we're going to probably have another September 11 attack
[3:30:18.400 --> 3:30:20.400]  They're going to test our president
[3:30:20.400 --> 3:30:24.400]  Biden says there's going to be something happen right when he gets inaugurated
[3:30:24.400 --> 3:30:27.400]  And that it's going to test him and that it's not going to be popular with Democrats
[3:30:27.400 --> 3:30:30.400]  You heard about Colin Powell on Meet the Press
[3:30:30.400 --> 3:30:35.400]  Two weeks ago I'm sure he was saying that if it was when he endorsed him
[3:30:35.400 --> 3:30:37.400]  He said he will be tested when he's inaugurated
[3:30:37.400 --> 3:30:43.400]  The 21st or 22nd with an international crisis that's manufactured
[3:30:43.400 --> 3:30:47.400]  So you're a newshound, you haven't heard about those?
[3:30:47.400 --> 3:30:55.400]  Well, I keep hearing these claims that he's going to be tested by terrorists
[3:30:55.400 --> 3:30:58.400]  But I don't believe that at all
[3:30:58.400 --> 3:31:10.400]  And if there is any new 9-11, I would be highly suspicious that terrorists had any responsibility for it
[3:31:10.400 --> 3:31:15.400]  You would look at it being staged like 9-11?
[3:31:15.400 --> 3:31:20.400]  I think any of these events will be staged
[3:31:20.400 --> 3:31:25.400]  I don't see the point of staging one
[3:31:25.400 --> 3:31:29.400]  Unless they're going to use it not to be inaugurated
[3:31:29.400 --> 3:31:35.400]  But since his government won't really be much different from the one that's in office now
[3:31:35.400 --> 3:31:42.400]  I don't know why they would care
[3:31:42.400 --> 3:31:47.400]  Whether he's inaugurated or not, it's going to be the same crowd
[3:31:47.400 --> 3:31:50.400]  The same group, the same interest groups doing the same thing
[3:31:50.400 --> 3:31:57.400]  Shifting gears back to the new Britain-Woods agreement, they're openly saying small group of international banks setting world policy
[3:31:57.400 --> 3:31:59.400]  Sticklets is saying it, they're all saying it
[3:31:59.400 --> 3:32:07.400]  Basically world government oven by, that's their words, the banks setting global carbon credit taxes paid to them
[3:32:07.400 --> 3:32:11.400]  Do you think they're going to be able to get that coming up at this series of meetings?
[3:32:11.400 --> 3:32:21.400]  No, because the United States and Europe no longer are undisputed leaders
[3:32:21.400 --> 3:32:30.400]  The United States is busted and totally dependent on foreigners, primarily Asians and Arabs
[3:32:30.400 --> 3:32:37.400]  To finance their consumption and their daily operation of their government, their wars, the defense budget
[3:32:37.400 --> 3:32:46.400]  The Chinese and the Russians are not going to let themselves be put under the thumb of some kind of a banking group
[3:32:46.400 --> 3:32:48.400]  It's not going to happen
[3:32:48.400 --> 3:33:00.400]  I think that what this November 15th meeting is about is the rest of the world
[3:33:00.400 --> 3:33:11.400]  It's serving notice on the United States that it's no longer going to be the one that calls the financial turns
[3:33:11.400 --> 3:33:16.400]  Because the dollar needs international support
[3:33:16.400 --> 3:33:25.400]  And Wall Street has shown that it's irresponsible and incompetent
[3:33:25.400 --> 3:33:28.400]  And so its credibility is gone
[3:33:28.400 --> 3:33:40.400]  What you're going to see people, what they're going to say is, look, we need to move to a reserve currency that's a basket of currencies
[3:33:40.400 --> 3:33:46.400]  Which the dollar plays a role but is no longer the dominant factor
[3:33:46.400 --> 3:33:51.400]  So I think that's what's going to start
[3:33:51.400 --> 3:34:04.400]  And so I don't think the banks are going to take over the Chinese and not going to let some stupid European bank conspiracy take over China
[3:34:04.400 --> 3:34:13.400]  And certainly the Russians aren't, they almost had that after the collapse of the Soviet Union that they were struggling
[3:34:13.400 --> 3:34:20.400]  They almost got taken over but Putin ran them all out of the country and I don't think he's going to let them back
[3:34:20.400 --> 3:34:40.400]  And there's going to be so many problems here from unemployment, from tent cities, from whatever the ridiculous policies that the Congress passes
[3:34:40.400 --> 3:34:45.400]  That they're going to just have their hands full with troubles
[3:34:45.400 --> 3:34:58.400]  Let me ask you this question, why do they keep saying, because you worked in the White House, you headed up the Treasury, you've been part of it, different international bodies studying Russian-U.S. relations
[3:34:58.400 --> 3:35:01.400]  So you've got your finger someone on the pulse of this, better than I do
[3:35:01.400 --> 3:35:10.400]  They keep saying to the liberal press, get ready, he's going to do things you don't like, he's going to do things internationally you don't like
[3:35:10.400 --> 3:35:12.400]  He's going to do things militarily you don't like
[3:35:12.400 --> 3:35:22.400]  And the press says, well what is it, well we can't tell you, what is it they're talking about or what do you think it may be they're talking about
[3:35:22.400 --> 3:35:30.400]  That they're worried and getting the media and the population ready for it, because that's all they talk about
[3:35:30.400 --> 3:35:39.400]  There's probably 25 articles a day with even Merkel and Brown and Sarkozy
[3:35:39.400 --> 3:35:42.400]  I mean that's all they're talking about
[3:35:42.400 --> 3:35:54.400]  Yeah well I don't know, I really don't know, but all I can say is I don't think their power is very great
[3:35:54.400 --> 3:36:13.400]  And I think the new very heavily populated countries are going to carry the balance of power in the future, India and town, even possibly Brazil
[3:36:13.400 --> 3:36:24.400]  These countries are on the rise, they're not going to put up any more being bossed around by a bunch of dumb shit Europeans and Americans are just not going to
[3:36:24.400 --> 3:36:31.400]  Dr. Roberts please, please, we've got a lot of stations out there, but I guess you're the former head of the treasury so whatever
[3:36:31.400 --> 3:36:34.400]  The point is, I'm even hearing this kind of talk on NPR now so I guess things are changing
[3:36:34.400 --> 3:36:39.400]  My point is, here's another example, I go on Russia today just like you do
[3:36:39.400 --> 3:36:45.400]  I talk to Russians, they're trying to be free market, they hate communism, I talk to them
[3:36:45.400 --> 3:36:53.400]  But then I go on Russia today, I say it's wrong that we attack Russia through Georgia in South Ossetia as a proxy
[3:36:53.400 --> 3:37:00.400]  And then I have all these idiot neocons emailing me going, you work for the Russians, you're KGB, they're so childlike
[3:37:00.400 --> 3:37:07.400]  You worked out some of the deals with the Russians there at the end of the Reagan administration to help bring down the Berlin Wall and the rest of it
[3:37:07.400 --> 3:37:14.400]  Would you like to explain to them from your perspective who the Russians really are today instead of just claiming they're a bunch of commies?
[3:37:14.400 --> 3:37:22.400]  Well, they're not commies, I mean, Gorbachev was a commie and gave it up himself
[3:37:22.400 --> 3:37:28.400]  So no, they're not commies, they've had 75 years of that and it cured them
[3:37:28.400 --> 3:37:37.400]  And, you know, if you look at the way their leaders speak, they speak the way we used to speak
[3:37:37.400 --> 3:37:44.400]  They want international cooperation, they want international law, they want people to follow the rules
[3:37:44.400 --> 3:37:49.400]  They don't want arms races, they don't want military adventures
[3:37:49.400 --> 3:37:59.400]  They sound like outfounding fathers, so they don't have any empire aims
[3:37:59.400 --> 3:38:09.400]  And I don't think, I think communism is a gone thing, it's gone even in China
[3:38:09.400 --> 3:38:16.400]  They still have the Communist Party, but they're not communist in any policy sense or any political sense
[3:38:16.400 --> 3:38:23.400]  I'm not really calling it socialism to bail out these banks, but I just call that a good old fashioned looting or bank robbery
[3:38:23.400 --> 3:38:24.400]  But if anybody...
[3:38:24.400 --> 3:38:33.400]  Yeah, it's probably what it is, it was a heist, it was a bank heist, they took all that money and they carried the banks and they're using it now to borrow the banks
[3:38:33.400 --> 3:38:39.400]  So the whole thing was a fraud, like everything else they've told us
[3:38:39.400 --> 3:38:46.400]  You know, like 9-11, like Iraqi weapons of mass destruction, like Iranian nukes
[3:38:46.400 --> 3:38:54.400]  They tell you stuff, get everybody all scared and rush something through, it was pillage, yeah
[3:38:54.400 --> 3:38:58.400]  Well, that's my last question, sir, and we're going to let you go and we appreciate the time
[3:38:58.400 --> 3:39:03.400]  I remember reading the Banker bailout bill, and by the way, the final version had it just in more legalese terms
[3:39:03.400 --> 3:39:09.400]  About no one can review this, no one can look at this, it will be secret, no court can review it
[3:39:09.400 --> 3:39:15.400]  Bloomberg reported, correctly, Ron Paul's reported, it's more like 5 trillion, they've already sucked about a trillion out
[3:39:15.400 --> 3:39:24.400]  And now, even the New York Times reported, the head of Goldman Sachs in a conference called with another one of the big brokerage firms saying
[3:39:24.400 --> 3:39:31.400]  Oh, this is great, we're going to use this for bonuses and to buy other banks and insurance companies and other corporations
[3:39:31.400 --> 3:39:35.400]  And no, we're not going to loan it out to the people and get the economy going
[3:39:35.400 --> 3:39:40.400]  And they're so arrogant, just in front of reporters, they'll brag about it
[3:39:40.400 --> 3:39:51.400]  It sounds like insane hubris, and then Goldman Sachs England took a 7.5 billion pound bonuses, 14 plus billion in dollars
[3:39:51.400 --> 3:39:58.400]  And again, every time I think I can't be shocked, it just goes to a new level of insanity
[3:39:58.400 --> 3:40:05.400]  That's right, you know, we're easy, we're people who are easy to con
[3:40:05.400 --> 3:40:13.400]  Because they still trust the government despite everything they've seen and learned and witnessed
[3:40:13.400 --> 3:40:19.400]  And whatever it tells them the next day, they'll believe that too, that's the whole problem, isn't it, Alex?
[3:40:19.400 --> 3:40:26.400]  Well, I agree that some people are dumbed down, but they had a thousand to one phone calls, polls were 95, 98 depending on the poll
[3:40:26.400 --> 3:40:33.400]  Against the bailout, and then I had congressmen on, they were threatened with physical martial law by the executive branch
[3:40:33.400 --> 3:40:39.400]  And they didn't pass that a month ago, so in a way it's not even the people of the congress now
[3:40:39.400 --> 3:40:46.400]  I think it's just executive terrorism, and now Obama's announcing his whole cabinet basically, and it's the same people
[3:40:46.400 --> 3:40:55.400]  Yeah, it's the same people, but still, where are they going to get the money?
[3:40:55.400 --> 3:41:00.400]  The economy's in recession, I mean, you saw what the job report was today
[3:41:00.400 --> 3:41:09.400]  Another 200,000 down, and even the rig way of measuring unemployment
[3:41:09.400 --> 3:41:20.400]  They say now it's the highest in a couple of decades, so it's not a situation that's propitious for them
[3:41:20.400 --> 3:41:29.400]  And the more they do this, I think the more they'll be to pay at some point
[3:41:29.400 --> 3:41:35.400]  But you can't say you're going to be a world power while you run the country into the ground
[3:41:35.400 --> 3:41:39.400]  Well, that's what I was going to ask, they had the greatest engine, even if we were going to have a corrupt new world order system
[3:41:39.400 --> 3:41:47.400]  We had the big empire, the wealth, the power, and they just like a third world country, they're just looting it
[3:41:47.400 --> 3:41:52.400]  So even from a position of wanting to have long term power, it looks like what they're doing is bad
[3:41:52.400 --> 3:42:03.400]  That's right, you can't be a powerhouse if the rulers are running the country into the ground, the two things are incompatible
[3:42:03.400 --> 3:42:08.400]  Why was that decision made to do that? It wasn't done in the past in US history?
[3:42:08.400 --> 3:42:18.400]  I don't know, I just don't know Alex, they don't call me up and tell me
[3:42:18.400 --> 3:42:28.400]  The things that have happened don't make a lot of sense, and they don't really lead to any good result, even for the people doing it
[3:42:28.400 --> 3:42:40.400]  So whether it's hubris, arrogance, hubris, stupidity, why in the world did Napoleon march off into Russia?
[3:42:40.400 --> 3:42:42.400]  There was no reason for him to do that
[3:42:42.400 --> 3:42:44.400]  Why did Hitler go to North Africa?
[3:42:44.400 --> 3:42:51.400]  Yeah, and why did he march off into Russia? People do things that are stupid
[3:42:51.400 --> 3:43:00.400]  They get drunk and drive their car and crash and kill a bunch of people, why do they do things?
[3:43:00.400 --> 3:43:06.400]  Well I guess it's because like the PNAC said, we got the power, why not go for global domination?
[3:43:06.400 --> 3:43:11.400]  And that's what they're doing, and I think they're just so arrogant with all their hookers and money and power
[3:43:11.400 --> 3:43:16.400]  and all the yes men that I think they really still think that they're unstoppable
[3:43:16.400 --> 3:43:21.400]  Don't you think global domination came to an end in Georgia?
[3:43:21.400 --> 3:43:27.400]  It took the Russian soldiers a few hours to clear out the army we had trained and equipped
[3:43:27.400 --> 3:43:33.400]  And don't you think it's come to an end in Afghanistan?
[3:43:33.400 --> 3:43:35.400]  What about Israel and Hezbollah?
[3:43:35.400 --> 3:43:47.400]  In Iraq and Israel has tried twice to defeat Hezbollah and failed and I don't know, I don't think we're going to be able to dominate anything
[3:43:47.400 --> 3:43:58.400]  and I think that's what the meeting on November 15th is about, that Europeans and the rest are going to tell us that we're going to dominate less, fewer things
[3:43:58.400 --> 3:44:02.400]  What do you see happening to the dollar when they do that?
[3:44:02.400 --> 3:44:12.400]  Well, it'll be part of saving the dollar, it'll be part of, I mean the dollar's going to be saved by being reduced
[3:44:12.400 --> 3:44:20.400]  You know, it can't go on like it is, I mean the Chinese themselves said, you know, one of my columns a week or so ago
[3:44:20.400 --> 3:44:27.400]  I was quoting what the Chinese had to say about the dollar and all this, and they said, why in the world are we lending to the Americans
[3:44:27.400 --> 3:44:32.400]  so they can go on forever deeper in debt?
[3:44:32.400 --> 3:44:44.400]  And so everybody sees it and I think the financial crisis has sort of made them think that it's time for them to rein it in
[3:44:44.400 --> 3:44:52.400]  Obviously the Americans aren't smart enough or willing to, so the rest of the world is going to rein it in, I think
[3:44:52.400 --> 3:45:01.400]  I think that's what is, and it'll take a while, it won't happen immediately and people will be excited, the Bush is gone
[3:45:01.400 --> 3:45:08.400]  and they've got Obama and he's the first black American and this proves the Americans aren't as racist as we thought
[3:45:08.400 --> 3:45:16.400]  and maybe they're better in other ways than we thought and maybe we need to give them a second chance
[3:45:16.400 --> 3:45:21.400]  But won't that goodwill turn into bitter poison if Obama pulls a bunch of stunts?
[3:45:21.400 --> 3:45:30.400]  Right, it will, it will, and if it turns into bitter poison before they've rescued us, then we're really going to have hard times here
[3:45:30.400 --> 3:45:41.400]  Look, if people, if you've got a trillion dollar budget deficit and foreigners won't lend you money, how do you finance it?
[3:45:41.400 --> 3:45:45.400]  You have to print money and then you get into Weimar Germany
[3:45:45.400 --> 3:45:53.400]  Now, how powerful was the Weimar Germany government? It wasn't powerful at all because it inflated everybody into nothing
[3:45:53.400 --> 3:45:56.400]  and people hated it
[3:45:56.400 --> 3:46:03.400]  A lot of economists say we've already done enough printing to pretty much cause that a few years down the road
[3:46:03.400 --> 3:46:11.400]  Well, no, nothing like what would be if they have to print the money to pay their bills
[3:46:11.400 --> 3:46:18.400]  if they can't any longer borrow from the Arabs and the Chinese and the Japanese and even the Russians
[3:46:18.400 --> 3:46:25.400]  I mean, the Russians owned a hundred billion dollars of our Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac mortgages
[3:46:25.400 --> 3:46:30.400]  I mean, even the Russians are financing Americans mortgages
[3:46:30.400 --> 3:46:38.400]  I mean, the Chinese held 400 billion dollars of American mortgages
[3:46:38.400 --> 3:46:42.400]  We can't even buy our own houses without foreign financing
[3:46:42.400 --> 3:46:47.400]  This is true. You have to realize it's not a superpower
[3:46:47.400 --> 3:46:54.400]  It's a financially dependent country being run into the ground by a bunch of shysters
[3:46:54.400 --> 3:46:56.400]  No, I agree
[3:46:56.400 --> 3:46:58.400]  I agree
[3:46:58.400 --> 3:47:00.400]  Well
[3:47:00.400 --> 3:47:11.400]  So, you know, I don't think Obama will bring change, but I think the financial deterioration of the United States will bring change
[3:47:11.400 --> 3:47:14.400]  and I can't say what that change is going to be
[3:47:14.400 --> 3:47:20.400]  whether we're going to pull our boots up and get to work in the right way
[3:47:20.400 --> 3:47:23.400]  or whether we're going to end up in some kind of a worst pickle
[3:47:23.400 --> 3:47:28.400]  Alright, Dr. Roberts, the tyranny of good intentions is the book. Get it? Thank you for joining us
[3:47:28.400 --> 3:47:30.400]  Thank you, Alex. Goodbye
[3:47:30.400 --> 3:47:33.400]  There he goes. Final segment straight ahead. Stay with us. Stay the course
[3:47:33.400 --> 3:47:35.400]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees
[3:47:35.400 --> 3:47:38.400]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty
[3:47:38.400 --> 3:47:43.400]  I think the financial deterioration of the United States will bring change
[3:47:43.400 --> 3:47:46.400]  and I can't say what that change is going to be
[3:47:46.400 --> 3:47:52.400]  whether we're going to pull our boots up and get to work in the right way
[3:47:52.400 --> 3:47:55.400]  or whether we're going to end up in some kind of a worst pickle
[3:47:55.400 --> 3:48:00.400]  Alright, Dr. Roberts, the tyranny of good intentions is the book. Get it? Thank you for joining us
[3:48:00.400 --> 3:48:02.400]  Thank you, Alex. Goodbye
[3:48:02.400 --> 3:48:05.400]  There he goes. Final segment straight ahead. Stay with us. Stay the course
[3:48:05.400 --> 3:48:07.400]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees
[3:48:07.400 --> 3:48:11.400]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide
[3:48:11.400 --> 3:48:13.400]  but in Liberty's darkest hour there is hope
[3:48:13.400 --> 3:48:16.400]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up
[3:48:16.400 --> 3:48:22.400]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order master plan
[3:48:22.400 --> 3:48:26.400]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat
[3:48:26.400 --> 3:48:31.400]  In the Info War, prisonplanet.tv is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom
[3:48:31.400 --> 3:48:34.400]  Prisonplanet.tv is a vault of forbidden information

[3:49:03.400 --> 3:49:05.400]  Prisonplanet.tv
[3:49:05.400 --> 3:49:07.400]  Hello, I'm Steve Shang
[3:49:07.400 --> 3:49:11.400]  For the past several months, folks have constantly asked me to give them the date
[3:49:11.400 --> 3:49:14.400]  as to when they should be finished stocking up on food
[3:49:14.400 --> 3:49:19.400]  We've been so beaten up by stock market banking, housing and unemployment crashes
[3:49:19.400 --> 3:49:23.400]  that we're desensitized and frozen and active like the frog being unknowingly cooked
[3:49:23.400 --> 3:49:25.400]  in gradually increasingly hot water
[3:49:25.400 --> 3:49:28.400]  We'll snap out of it, we now have a deadline
[3:49:28.400 --> 3:49:30.400]  Joe Biden said it's gonna happen
[3:49:30.400 --> 3:49:34.400]  Former Secretary of State Colin Powell went on CBS Meet the Press
[3:49:34.400 --> 3:49:38.400]  and pointed to about January 22nd as the time a major international incident
[3:49:38.400 --> 3:49:42.400]  would force the new president to make unpopular decisions
[3:49:42.400 --> 3:49:46.400]  While I take the general at his word, my best advice is to have your food in your possession
[3:49:46.400 --> 3:49:48.400]  prior to the inauguration
[3:49:48.400 --> 3:49:51.400]  Contact eFoodsDirect.com for your supplies
[3:49:51.400 --> 3:49:53.400]  prior to this deadline for disaster
[3:49:53.400 --> 3:49:56.400]  Ask yourself, is it better to have too much too soon
[3:49:56.400 --> 3:49:58.400]  or too little too late
[3:49:58.400 --> 3:50:03.400]  Call 800-409-5633 or on the web eFoodsDirect.com
[3:50:05.400 --> 3:50:09.400]  I am so frustrated, I can't seem to remember anything anymore
[3:50:09.400 --> 3:50:12.400]  Seriously, my memory and attention span is terrible
[3:50:12.400 --> 3:50:14.400]  I read something and forget
[3:50:14.400 --> 3:50:17.400]  I forget people's names, I hear all this great information on the radio
[3:50:17.400 --> 3:50:19.400]  and I want to tell people, but I forget
[3:50:19.400 --> 3:50:21.400]  Okay, slow down, pour it
[3:50:21.400 --> 3:50:24.400]  No questions asked, no time limit
[3:50:24.400 --> 3:50:25.400]  We're going
[3:50:25.400 --> 3:50:26.400]  We'll be back guarantee
[3:50:26.400 --> 3:50:27.400]  Wow, what's the website?
[3:50:27.400 --> 3:50:30.400]  Now, don't forget, it's pmemory.net
[3:50:30.400 --> 3:50:33.400]  The letter P, memory.net
[3:50:33.400 --> 3:50:39.400]  Don't forget, I'll be live this Sunday
[3:50:39.400 --> 3:50:41.400]  4-6 p.m. on the abbreviated Sunday edition
[3:50:41.400 --> 3:50:43.400]  Central Standard Time
[3:50:43.400 --> 3:50:46.400]  Be sure and join us then
[3:50:46.400 --> 3:50:48.400]  I repeat
[3:50:48.400 --> 3:50:51.400]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen
[3:50:51.400 --> 3:50:55.400]  Have wide of them phones again this Sunday
[3:50:55.400 --> 3:50:59.400]  By the way, this stuff gets worse and worse with Obama
[3:50:59.400 --> 3:51:00.400]  We're discovering about the minute
[3:51:00.400 --> 3:51:02.400]  We should have done more research on this, we knew it was bad
[3:51:02.400 --> 3:51:06.400]  Even the Albuquerque examiner has the headline
[3:51:06.400 --> 3:51:09.400]  Ron Manuel wants compulsory service for your kids
[3:51:09.400 --> 3:51:12.400]  That's on the Obama website now
[3:51:12.400 --> 3:51:15.400]  It says your kids are going to have to go serve the government
[3:51:15.400 --> 3:51:19.400]  Youth brigades, tattletale squads
[3:51:19.400 --> 3:51:22.400]  I mean, you can't make this stuff up
[3:51:22.400 --> 3:51:23.400]  And see, they know though
[3:51:23.400 --> 3:51:26.400]  They're going to have the brainwashed kids wanting to be part of it
[3:51:26.400 --> 3:51:29.400]  Let me tell you, look, teenagers with guns
[3:51:29.400 --> 3:51:32.400]  Just stay away from your little thugs and your little black uniforms
[3:51:32.400 --> 3:51:35.400]  I mean, just stay away your anti-American trash
[3:51:35.400 --> 3:51:39.400]  This is total, new world order, Nazism slash communism
[3:51:39.400 --> 3:51:43.400]  Folks, the news I'm looking at at infowars.com and prismplanet.com
[3:51:43.400 --> 3:51:45.400]  I'm going to cover it all Sunday
[3:51:45.400 --> 3:51:48.400]  If I have guests and take calls, I won't have time
[3:51:48.400 --> 3:51:50.400]  There's just hundreds of incredible things
[3:51:50.400 --> 3:51:52.400]  This is all off the chart
[3:51:52.400 --> 3:51:56.400]  We've got about four minutes left
[3:51:56.400 --> 3:52:00.400]  I want to bring Ted Anderson up with a gold and silver offer
[3:52:00.400 --> 3:52:06.400]  And folks understand, most people can't even get it at a 20, 30, 40, 50 percent premium
[3:52:06.400 --> 3:52:09.400]  Ted has the national and international sources
[3:52:09.400 --> 3:52:14.400]  To get gold and silver because he buys it in bulk
[3:52:14.400 --> 3:52:16.400]  At spot
[3:52:16.400 --> 3:52:18.400]  And then he even buys it when it's down like it was a week ago
[3:52:18.400 --> 3:52:19.400]  And now it's way up
[3:52:19.400 --> 3:52:22.400]  And he sells it for what he got it for when it was down
[3:52:22.400 --> 3:52:24.400]  You cannot find deals better than this
[3:52:24.400 --> 3:52:26.400]  Believe me, I've looked
[3:52:26.400 --> 3:52:28.400]  He has Indians
[3:52:28.400 --> 3:52:30.400]  He has, well, Ted, real fast
[3:52:30.400 --> 3:52:31.400]  Tell them what you've got
[3:52:31.400 --> 3:52:33.400]  Tell them the gold and silver you've got today
[3:52:33.400 --> 3:52:35.400]  Well, obviously one of the very popular coins
[3:52:35.400 --> 3:52:38.400]  Is that Augustus St. God and Design, the $10 Indian
[3:52:38.400 --> 3:52:39.400]  Very beautiful piece
[3:52:39.400 --> 3:52:42.400]  But at the same time, you get so much gold for your melt value
[3:52:42.400 --> 3:52:45.400]  And you're not going to find it anywhere else, that's for sure
[3:52:45.400 --> 3:52:50.400]  That coin currently right now is trading at a price of 673
[3:52:50.400 --> 3:52:52.400]  It's a $10 Indian
[3:52:52.400 --> 3:52:54.400]  It's just, you can't beat it
[3:52:54.400 --> 3:52:57.400]  I mean, that's the coin that was issued by Augustus St. God
[3:52:57.400 --> 3:53:00.400]  And Teddy Roosevelt, it's a beautiful piece
[3:53:00.400 --> 3:53:02.400]  I also have those $5 moderns in MS-70
[3:53:02.400 --> 3:53:04.400]  I mean, these are slabbed coins
[3:53:04.400 --> 3:53:06.400]  Issued by the U.S. Mint as collector
[3:53:06.400 --> 3:53:10.400]  They're basically confiscation proof
[3:53:10.400 --> 3:53:12.400]  You know, the United States government
[3:53:12.400 --> 3:53:14.400]  Can call them bullion gold and take them from you
[3:53:14.400 --> 3:53:16.400]  Because they sold them as numismatic
[3:53:16.400 --> 3:53:18.400]  So they're at 384
[3:53:18.400 --> 3:53:20.400]  That also is just a fabulous buy
[3:53:20.400 --> 3:53:22.400]  Getting close to the melt value
[3:53:22.400 --> 3:53:24.400]  Like you're talking about the spot prices
[3:53:24.400 --> 3:53:26.400]  That's the Frank at 198
[3:53:26.400 --> 3:53:29.400]  And the British sovereign at 241
[3:53:29.400 --> 3:53:31.400]  Right now at this particular time
[3:53:31.400 --> 3:53:33.400]  Small gold makes an awful lot of sense
[3:53:33.400 --> 3:53:35.400]  I mean, listen to Paul Craig Roberts
[3:53:35.400 --> 3:53:37.400]  You know, some of these interviews just
[3:53:37.400 --> 3:53:40.400]  Jack me up so much, Alex, I just can't believe it
[3:53:40.400 --> 3:53:42.400]  Well, by the way, I mean
[3:53:42.400 --> 3:53:45.400]  For the most gold, for the least amount of money
[3:53:45.400 --> 3:53:46.400]  It's the Franks, isn't it?
[3:53:46.400 --> 3:53:48.400]  Yeah, that's definitely hands down
[3:53:48.400 --> 3:53:50.400]  And then the next best deal is
[3:53:50.400 --> 3:53:53.400]  The sovereigns, you've got an insane deal on sovereigns
[3:53:53.400 --> 3:53:55.400]  And to be clear, I bought two Indians yesterday
[3:53:55.400 --> 3:53:57.400]  Because it's such a gorgeous coin
[3:53:57.400 --> 3:53:59.400]  It's such a good deal on a collector coin
[3:53:59.400 --> 3:54:02.400]  I bought two Indians yesterday afternoon
[3:54:02.400 --> 3:54:05.400]  From Ted, because you can't find those anywhere near that
[3:54:05.400 --> 3:54:08.400]  800-686-2237
[3:54:08.400 --> 3:54:11.400]  800-686-2237
[3:54:11.400 --> 3:54:13.400]  But the sovereign and the Franks
[3:54:13.400 --> 3:54:14.400]  Those are probably per capita
[3:54:14.400 --> 3:54:16.400]  The best deal you're going to find anywhere in the country
[3:54:16.400 --> 3:54:19.400]  But it's also a great deal on those Indians
[3:54:19.400 --> 3:54:23.400]  1-800-686-2237
[3:54:23.400 --> 3:54:25.400]  And Ted, they're going to be brokers there all weekend
[3:54:25.400 --> 3:54:27.400]  Even though gold's going up right now
[3:54:27.400 --> 3:54:29.400]  You're going to be able to lock that in until Sunday?
[3:54:29.400 --> 3:54:31.400]  Absolutely, we'll hold the prices for them
[3:54:31.400 --> 3:54:32.400]  And there's going to be people there
[3:54:32.400 --> 3:54:34.400]  How late every evening, the brokers?
[3:54:34.400 --> 3:54:36.400]  Well, you know, a lot of the times they're here until midnight
[3:54:36.400 --> 3:54:38.400]  But, you know, at least until 11 o'clock central time
[3:54:38.400 --> 3:54:40.400]  You'll get somebody live to answer the telephone
[3:54:40.400 --> 3:54:45.400]  800-686-2237-800-686-2237
[3:54:45.400 --> 3:54:47.400]  What about silver?
[3:54:47.400 --> 3:54:49.400]  Silver is also a great buy at this time
[3:54:49.400 --> 3:54:52.400]  Still, the dimes are the best buy for the money
[3:54:52.400 --> 3:54:54.400]  They're a buck 69, you just can't
[3:54:54.400 --> 3:54:57.400]  Again, small pieces of silver, small pieces of gold
[3:54:57.400 --> 3:54:59.400]  Our economy is going to be a lot better
[3:54:59.400 --> 3:55:01.400]  800-686-2237
[3:55:01.400 --> 3:55:02.400]  Ted, thanks for coming on with us
[3:55:02.400 --> 3:55:03.400]  Thanks a lot, Ellis
[3:55:03.400 --> 3:55:04.400]  All right, retransmission on the web
