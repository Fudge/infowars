[00:00.000 --> 00:27.000]  Infowars, tomorrow's news, today.
[00:27.000 --> 00:37.000]  In your discussion, in your answer, you also said that you were invited by a friend, Barry Weiss.
[00:37.000 --> 00:39.000]  My friend Barry Weiss.
[00:39.000 --> 00:42.000]  So this friend works for Twitter, or what is her?
[00:42.000 --> 00:44.000]  She's a journalist.
[00:44.000 --> 00:48.000]  Sir, I didn't ask you a question. I'm now asking Mr. Schellenberger a question.
[00:48.000 --> 00:50.000]  Yes, ma'am. Barry Weiss is a journalist.
[00:50.000 --> 00:51.000]  I'm sorry, sir?
[00:51.000 --> 00:52.000]  She's a journalist.
[00:52.000 --> 00:54.000]  She's a journalist, so you work in concert with her?
[00:54.000 --> 00:56.000]  Yeah.
[00:56.000 --> 01:00.000]  Do you know when she first was contacted by Mr. Musk?
[01:00.000 --> 01:01.000]  I don't know.
[01:01.000 --> 01:02.000]  You don't know?
[01:02.000 --> 01:07.000]  So you're in this as a threesome?
[01:07.000 --> 01:09.000]  There was many more people involved than that.
[01:09.000 --> 01:15.000]  There was many more people involved with it.
[01:15.000 --> 01:18.000]  Everybody got a kick out of that.
[01:18.000 --> 01:21.000]  I guess you could call what happened Wednesday afternoon.
[01:21.000 --> 01:27.000]  And orgy, if three reporters working together as a menage Ã  trois,
[01:27.000 --> 01:34.000]  then I guess when I called more than 15 reporters Wednesday to make sure this broke the next day,
[01:34.000 --> 01:36.000]  and now it's all over the place.
[01:36.000 --> 01:41.000]  See, info wars can't absorb and eat this whole elephant.
[01:41.000 --> 01:44.000]  And so a lot of journalists and reporters and talk shows,
[01:44.000 --> 01:49.000]  when they got a bunch of big news but can't get to it all, they just sit on it.
[01:49.000 --> 01:51.000]  Not me.
[01:51.000 --> 01:53.000]  And I don't tell the story to brag.
[01:53.000 --> 01:57.000]  I tell it because it's something other people should start doing and other folks aren't starting to do it.
[01:57.000 --> 02:00.000]  I don't care about breaking the big stories.
[02:00.000 --> 02:02.000]  I care about defeating the new world order.
[02:02.000 --> 02:07.000]  And if I don't have people in D.C. to go to the Proud Boys kangaroo trial,
[02:07.000 --> 02:10.000]  where the feds accidentally leaked the fact that they were ordered to destroy evidence
[02:10.000 --> 02:13.000]  and commit a bunch of other things that look like serious crimes,
[02:13.000 --> 02:20.000]  I just called up more than 15 different reporters and organizations and groups
[02:20.000 --> 02:25.000]  and pointed them at the court filing that was about to be made at 11 o'clock Wednesday night,
[02:25.000 --> 02:30.000]  that it all started breaking yesterday as the press went and found out it was true.
[02:30.000 --> 02:34.000]  And now we've got all these articles out on it today.
[02:34.000 --> 02:42.000]  Proud Boys January 6th edition trial halted after leaked chat log show FBI agent said her boss ordered her to destroy evidence,
[02:42.000 --> 02:45.000]  ordered her to destroy evidence and more.
[02:45.000 --> 02:51.000]  Here's one out of WUSA TV station in D.C.
[02:51.000 --> 02:56.000]  Spill of potentially classified messages upends Proud Boys trial.
[02:56.000 --> 03:03.000]  And when you go read these articles, it's everything I told you Thursday here on the show.
[03:03.000 --> 03:10.000]  And now it's all over the news today and they may suspend the trial.
[03:10.000 --> 03:12.000]  They may have to have a missed trial.
[03:12.000 --> 03:15.000]  I mean, normally you would, but D.C. is so corrupt.
[03:15.000 --> 03:19.000]  But see, that's a little example of an orgy.
[03:19.000 --> 03:23.000]  Because if you think, well, she's like, well, what are you doing talking to other journalists?
[03:23.000 --> 03:27.000]  That's kind of weird. Why are you sharing stuff with people?
[03:27.000 --> 03:30.000]  Because that's what you do when you're a real journalist.
[03:30.000 --> 03:38.000]  Now, I wear a pundits hat, a journalist hat, a rancher's hat, a father's hat, a crazy man's hat.
[03:38.000 --> 03:40.000]  This is a talk show. We have a free-for-all here.
[03:40.000 --> 03:48.000]  But when it comes to hardcore breaking things, our greatest work has been handing the ball off to other people.
[03:48.000 --> 03:52.000]  And I've always said that's my mission is to become obsolete.
[03:52.000 --> 04:01.000]  Now, we're far from obsolete, but we've come halfway because you look around the world now and you see what's going on.
[04:01.000 --> 04:04.000]  And it's like Russell Brown sounds like Alex Jones.
[04:04.000 --> 04:07.000]  Matt Gaetz sounds like Alex Jones.
[04:07.000 --> 04:09.000]  Tucker Carlson sounds like Alex Jones.
[04:09.000 --> 04:12.000]  Joe Rogan sounds like Alex Jones.
[04:12.000 --> 04:15.000]  Everybody sounds like Alex Jones now. What the hell's going on?
[04:15.000 --> 04:17.000]  They got all these London Guardian articles, New York Times articles.
[04:17.000 --> 04:19.000]  Jones has infected the world.
[04:19.000 --> 04:23.000]  We can track what he says, and then later it's in all the talking points, even by Congress.
[04:23.000 --> 04:26.000]  This guy's the biggest menace the planet's ever seen.
[04:26.000 --> 04:29.000]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[04:29.000 --> 04:36.000]  They're just taking the blinders off and seeing from the angles I look at things, from different angles, and they're getting it.
[04:36.000 --> 04:41.000]  And once the public gets it, it's not just journalists, it's the public.
[04:41.000 --> 04:44.000]  It's bye-bye New World Order.
[04:44.000 --> 04:49.000]  It's Friday. We got one hell of a transmission lined up today.
[04:49.000 --> 04:52.000]  The Deed State's in full retreat.
[04:52.000 --> 04:55.000]  Stay with us. We'll be back.
[05:01.000 --> 05:05.000]  Right now, I'm not talking to the viewers and listeners.
[05:05.000 --> 05:10.000]  That have gone to infowarstore.com and gotten the great products that enrich your life,
[05:10.000 --> 05:13.000]  that empower your immune system and your body, and keep us on air.
[05:13.000 --> 05:19.000]  I am humbly, hand in hand, talking to the viewers and listeners that have tuned in many of you for years,
[05:19.000 --> 05:21.000]  and never gone to infowarstore.com.
[05:21.000 --> 05:27.000]  We know the vast, vast, vast, vast majority of you never actually go to infowarstore.com
[05:27.000 --> 05:30.000]  and never experience these great products and never find the operation.
[05:30.000 --> 05:33.000]  Sure, you share a link, you share an article, you tell folks about the show.
[05:33.000 --> 05:35.000]  That's great, and I thank you.
[05:35.000 --> 05:38.000]  But we need funds to operate. Plus, we've got really great products
[05:38.000 --> 05:42.000]  that do amazing things for people like our CBD oil and our Physiomagnetium
[05:42.000 --> 05:45.000]  and our Sweet Pate and our Nitrogen Oxide and our Real Red Pill Plus.
[05:45.000 --> 05:48.000]  All of these are really great products. They keep us on air.
[05:48.000 --> 05:50.000]  Plus, you're missing out on these products.
[05:50.000 --> 05:53.000]  So get off the bench, get in the game, step to the plate,
[05:53.000 --> 06:03.000]  and go to infowarstore.com right now and get these great info wars products at infowarstore.com.
[06:23.000 --> 06:34.000]  Deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide its Alex Jones.
[06:34.000 --> 06:38.000]  The hearings taking place in Congress are burning down the deep state.
[06:38.000 --> 06:41.000]  We're learning what we already knew, but it's all confirmed now,
[06:41.000 --> 06:44.000]  that major big pharma working with big tech in the government
[06:44.000 --> 06:49.000]  blocked the treatment of COVID's origins and reporters and others that were exposing it.
[06:49.000 --> 06:53.000]  Of course, the rain of terror continued on after those exposing election fraud, open borders, and more.
[06:53.000 --> 07:00.000]  It's all coming out. A giant organized crime, corporate governmental syndicate with intelligence agencies
[07:00.000 --> 07:07.000]  generaling the operation to shut down and suppress the American people in a digital dictatorship.
[07:07.000 --> 07:11.000]  A digital dictatorship that was growing tentacles and getting up on its legs,
[07:11.000 --> 07:15.000]  but now is burning down to the ground.
[07:15.000 --> 07:18.000]  I have to get to a question I'm amazed hasn't been asked of the two of you.
[07:18.000 --> 07:26.000]  This FTC consent decree, where it is government action subject to rigorous scrutiny under First Amendment standards,
[07:26.000 --> 07:30.000]  government action demanding that your names be listed.
[07:30.000 --> 07:38.000]  How did it feel when you found out that you were being expressly targeted by a government document based on your reporting?
[07:38.000 --> 07:44.000]  It was chilling. I mean, it's disturbing. I never thought that would happen in the United States of America, to be perfectly honest.
[07:44.000 --> 07:48.000]  I've lived in a bunch of authoritarian countries. I've visited a lot of authoritarian countries.
[07:48.000 --> 07:50.000]  Never thought this kind of thing would be going on here.
[07:50.000 --> 07:54.000]  And the nexus to authoritarianism is the desire to control the nature of truth itself.
[07:54.000 --> 07:58.000]  Our understandings change about things. We learn new things. We challenge prior assumptions.
[07:58.000 --> 08:02.000]  But if a bunch of people in Washington, D.C., get to decide what the truth is,
[08:02.000 --> 08:07.000]  and then enforce it on the country, and then punish and target those who report on their conduct,
[08:07.000 --> 08:11.000]  we are drifting more toward that. How did you feel, Mr. Tybee, when you saw your name?
[08:11.000 --> 08:18.000]  I was upset, obviously. I lived in Russia during the 90s and early 2000s.
[08:18.000 --> 08:25.000]  I was there when Putin took power. I was friends with a group of very brave, muckraking reporters in Russia,
[08:25.000 --> 08:30.000]  many of whom didn't make it. A few of them were murdered after Putin came to power.
[08:30.000 --> 08:36.000]  So I've always been conscious of how the risks that other reporters take in other countries are incredibly severe.
[08:36.000 --> 08:43.000]  And that's one of the reasons why I'm motivated to protect the First Amendment, because our country has the best protections for reporters in the world.
[08:43.000 --> 08:48.000]  But this kind of thing, where the government is looking for information about reporters,
[08:48.000 --> 08:55.000]  it's usually a canary in the coal mine that something worse is coming in terms of an effort to exercise control over the press.
[08:55.000 --> 08:58.000]  And so on that level, it's absolutely disturbing.
[08:58.000 --> 09:03.000]  Also, the Aspen Institute report that we published today, talked about today in the Twitter Files thread,
[09:03.000 --> 09:13.000]  one of their recommendations was that the FTC be empowered to have unlimited power to search all data of private companies
[09:13.000 --> 09:18.000]  so that they could more freely and more accurately search the speech of ordinary citizens.
[09:18.000 --> 09:24.000]  As we're trying to put downward pressure on the government's expanding authority to be able to engage in what we see mostly from dictatorships,
[09:24.000 --> 09:30.000]  what you're reporting and what you're observing is that actually they view this as a growth industry, the information business, right?
[09:30.000 --> 09:34.000]  This censorship industrial complex is a growth industry to the government.
[09:34.000 --> 09:37.000]  I think the key thing also, yes, and the thing to understand is that NSF...
[09:37.000 --> 09:40.000]  What is NewsGuard and how are they part of the censorship industrial complex?
[09:40.000 --> 09:42.000]  Yeah, and by the way, we talked about Richard Sangle, he's on the board of NewsGuard.
[09:42.000 --> 09:50.000]  NewsGuard and the Difference Disinformation Index are both U.S. government-funded entities who are working to drive advertising revenue away from disfavored publications
[09:50.000 --> 09:52.000]  and towards the ones that they favor.
[09:52.000 --> 09:54.000]  This is...
[09:54.000 --> 09:58.000]  What I'm used to in this town is government officials pick their favorite outlets, and they give them the best scoops,
[09:58.000 --> 10:03.000]  and they give them the best stories, and there's a fusion of media and government that has long made me uncomfortable.
[10:03.000 --> 10:10.000]  But what you're describing now is literally the directing of revenue to certain media companies over other media companies
[10:10.000 --> 10:14.000]  designed and implemented with U.S. government funding and support.
[10:14.000 --> 10:15.000]  That's right.
[10:15.000 --> 10:16.000]  That is an astonishing...
[10:16.000 --> 10:22.000]  If we do not take a look at NewsGuard, we have failed, and you talk about the brave reporting that occurs and what it subjects you to,
[10:22.000 --> 10:25.000]  I would suggest there's also political bravery that I have observed.
[10:25.000 --> 10:32.000]  We've only heard from Democrats on this panel attacking you, discrediting you, a lot like they've tried to attack and discredit FBI whistleblowers,
[10:32.000 --> 10:33.000]  who are truth tellers.
[10:33.000 --> 10:39.000]  There are brave Democrats who still believe in free speech, and I would advise my colleagues to look at the comments of Ro Khanna,
[10:39.000 --> 10:46.000]  who has been deeply, deeply concerned about this weaponization of government, and he believes these Twitter files are indeed worthy of our focus and our energy,
[10:46.000 --> 10:48.000]  and that is exactly what we are going to do.
[10:48.000 --> 10:53.000]  Coming to you from deep in the heart of Texas, I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[10:53.000 --> 10:55.000]  Thank you for joining us on this Friday Transmission.
[10:55.000 --> 10:56.000]  Wow.
[10:56.000 --> 10:58.000]  The wheels have come off the New World Order.
[10:58.000 --> 11:01.000]  Their engines blown, not just here, but around the planet.
[11:01.000 --> 11:09.000]  Humanity is waking up very, very fast to the technocracy, the mark of the beast, the global cashless society, the surveillance grid,
[11:09.000 --> 11:11.000]  the censorship straight jacket.
[11:11.000 --> 11:19.000]  Here is one of the journalists there in the hearings yesterday, Michael Schellenberger, on the Censorship Industrial Complex Orwellian Mission.
[11:19.000 --> 11:26.000]  We went from, you go from a situation where we were fighting ISIS recruiting, and then it was Russian disinformation,
[11:26.000 --> 11:36.000]  and now they're in a situation where they're wanting to censor true information, accurate facts, because they're worried that people might behave in ways that they don't want them to.
[11:36.000 --> 11:41.000]  That involves mind reading at a level that is grossly inappropriate.
[11:41.000 --> 11:47.000]  I mean, I worry even about making this defense, because let's remember, the First Amendment protects our right to be wrong.
[11:47.000 --> 11:49.000]  It protects our right to lie.
[11:49.000 --> 11:55.000]  I mean, it's bizarre to me that we would need to make a defense of the First Amendment and remind people that we have a right to be wrong.
[11:55.000 --> 12:02.000]  And being wrong, as Matt was explaining, is a big part of being a human being and having a democracy.
[12:02.000 --> 12:06.000]  So this is disturbing and Schellen, and you're absolutely right to be outraged by it.
[12:06.000 --> 12:17.000]  There needs to be a full truth and reconciliation that I hope everybody would appreciate having on this issue, because a lot of people here has come out about what they've done.
[12:17.000 --> 12:20.000]  And that reminds me, I sent these clips to the crew.
[12:20.000 --> 12:23.000]  There's one I forgot to send you, but it's all over the place.
[12:23.000 --> 12:26.000]  It was brought up a lot in the hearings in the last two days.
[12:26.000 --> 12:42.000]  And it's reading the Twitter files where the CDC and the New York Times and a bunch of other groups in this consortium of crime, this mafia organization of control, say specifically,
[12:42.000 --> 12:44.000]  okay, the vaccine's killing people.
[12:44.000 --> 12:46.000]  It is making people die.
[12:46.000 --> 12:47.000]  It is true. It doesn't work.
[12:47.000 --> 12:51.000]  But even though it's true, it's going to keep people from taking it.
[12:51.000 --> 12:53.000]  So we've got to suppress it.
[12:53.000 --> 12:56.000]  And that's what he was alluding to over and over again.
[12:56.000 --> 12:59.000]  Well, this is really technically true.
[12:59.000 --> 13:09.000]  Remember about a year and a half ago, the college sports player that had a full scholarship in Arizona, I forget the name, it was all over the news, had microcarditis.
[13:09.000 --> 13:13.000]  And the doctor said it was caused by the Moderna shot he took.
[13:13.000 --> 13:14.000]  And it almost killed him.
[13:14.000 --> 13:18.000]  And then they censored him on Yahoo and censored him on Instagram.
[13:18.000 --> 13:21.000]  His video had like 10 million views.
[13:21.000 --> 13:27.000]  And Yahoo said, well, we talked to the board at the UN that runs the censorship.
[13:27.000 --> 13:32.000]  And later, the head of that board last year, actually earlier this year, in January, she went on TV.
[13:32.000 --> 13:35.000]  We play the clip like 50 times, 15 probably, actually.
[13:35.000 --> 13:37.000]  And she said, oh, we actually run the censorship.
[13:37.000 --> 13:40.000]  We tell the big tech companies in the US government what to do.
[13:40.000 --> 13:42.000]  And then they censor it.
[13:42.000 --> 13:48.000]  And they said in the article, well, we went to the UN board that runs the censorship.
[13:48.000 --> 13:54.000]  And they said, well, it's true he had this microcarditis from the shot.
[13:54.000 --> 14:00.000]  We still suppressed it because it's going to cause vaccine hesitancy if people see his story.
[14:00.000 --> 14:02.000]  So we would advise him not to talk about it anymore.
[14:02.000 --> 14:06.000]  And I read that Yahoo article probably 10 times on air.
[14:06.000 --> 14:14.000]  And I'm just like, you wake up in the UN's in charge and they're like, oh, first we're going to censor because of ISIS or Russia or all this or racism or whatever.
[14:14.000 --> 14:20.000]  And now it's well, we're going to censor the truth because then we can't control the narrative.
[14:20.000 --> 14:25.000]  And then the greater good we're doing will be stopped.
[14:25.000 --> 14:35.000]  Total war on free speech is even mainline press is facing censorship and control.
[14:35.000 --> 14:40.000]  And go ahead and hit refresh on that headline because I actually decided to rewrite the headline for the show today.
[14:40.000 --> 14:41.000]  There it is.
[14:41.000 --> 14:46.000]  New World Order's secret war against free speech has been blown wide open by historic congressional hearings.
[14:46.000 --> 14:48.000]  Watch live.
[14:48.000 --> 14:51.000]  So that's what's happening right now.
[14:51.000 --> 15:05.000]  And it's illegal from so many angles to have government and intelligence agencies and dinosaur legacy media with think tanks and big tech all working in tandem in these big workstations.
[15:05.000 --> 15:06.000]  And it's not just Twitter.
[15:06.000 --> 15:09.000]  We know about this because Elon Musk allowed it to be seen.
[15:09.000 --> 15:13.000]  So now he's under criminal investigation by the FTC and the FBI.
[15:13.000 --> 15:14.000]  They admit that.
[15:14.000 --> 15:22.000]  And they want to know who all the journalists are that he's let's see the censorship files run by the FBI because it was the FBI.
[15:22.000 --> 15:27.000]  One of their former senior agents running that department in Twitter.
[15:27.000 --> 15:40.000]  And they gave national security clearances to hundreds of Twitter executives so they can begin access to these classified databases and dashboards that can read all your private stuff that has everything about you.
[15:40.000 --> 15:49.000]  They have created an army of activated spies to illegally attack, surveil, censor, harass and then be platform and debank us.
[15:49.000 --> 15:51.000]  That's the social credit score.
[15:51.000 --> 15:52.000]  It's not coming.
[15:52.000 --> 15:53.000]  It's here.
[15:53.000 --> 15:56.000]  And now the big illegal social credit score is being exposed in Congress.
[15:56.000 --> 15:59.000]  The people involved all need to go to prison now.
[16:27.000 --> 16:33.000]  So get your copy of the Great Reset and the War for the World, a signed copy at InfoWars4.com.
[16:33.000 --> 16:37.000]  And there is a markup there because this is a fundraiser to keep us on the air.
[16:37.000 --> 16:40.000]  So you won't just have this historic memento and this powerful book.
[16:40.000 --> 16:43.000]  You'll also know that you help keep InfoWars on the air.
[16:43.000 --> 16:47.000]  I'm going to thank those of you that have gotten signed copies of the book or unsigned copies.
[16:47.000 --> 16:57.000]  But I want to encourage all of you who haven't yet to go to InfoWars4.com and get a signed copy and buy a couple of unsigned copies and donate to the library or give them to the local school.
[16:57.000 --> 16:58.000]  This is an Info War.
[16:58.000 --> 17:00.000]  I'm counting on you and thank you for your support.
[17:00.000 --> 17:08.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, InfoWars has proven itself in the last 28 years to be over the globalist target and having the biggest effect out there against those tyrants.
[17:08.000 --> 17:14.000]  And we fund our operation with viewers and listeners support while selling you great products at the same time.
[17:14.000 --> 17:21.000]  So I want to thank all the viewers and listeners who have supported us over the years by spreading the word, praying for the broadcast and buying product.
[17:21.000 --> 17:35.000]  But I really want to encourage those of you that have been on the fence and have never actually gone to InfoWars4.com to go there and get the great books and films and supplements and survival gear that's there that won't just empower you and enrich your life,
[17:35.000 --> 17:38.000]  but again will keep this broadcast transmitting.

[18:13.000 --> 18:23.000]  That's why I ask listeners respectfully to go to InfoWars4.com and buy great products that will enrich and empower your life while keeping us on air at the very same time.

[18:46.000 --> 18:51.000]  You've been watching for years, you've been listening for years, but you've never taken the step to go to InfoWars4.com.
[18:51.000 --> 18:55.000]  These are great products that really work and are amazing, plus they keep us on air.
[18:55.000 --> 19:00.000]  So again, please take action, go to InfoWars4.com today and I thank you.
[19:00.000 --> 19:04.000]  InfoWars, tomorrow's news, today.
[19:04.000 --> 19:06.000]  This is their big move.
[19:06.000 --> 19:10.000]  So yeah, you say, why doesn't Biden address the disasters in the United States?
[19:10.000 --> 19:11.000]  He doesn't care.
[19:11.000 --> 19:13.000]  That's not his job.
[19:13.000 --> 19:15.000]  He's not the president of the United States.
[19:15.000 --> 19:18.000]  He's a puppet operating for the globalists.
[19:18.000 --> 19:23.000]  Appetites of the autocrat cannot be appeased.
[19:23.000 --> 19:25.000]  They must be opposed.
[19:25.000 --> 19:31.000]  Autocrats only understand one word, no, no, no.
[19:31.000 --> 19:32.000]  Exactly.
[19:32.000 --> 19:35.000]  And that's why we say no to your vaccines.
[19:35.000 --> 19:38.000]  We say no to you shutting down our businesses.
[19:38.000 --> 19:41.000]  We say no to you taking our firearms.
[19:41.000 --> 19:43.000]  We say no to you censoring our free speech.
[19:43.000 --> 19:47.000]  We say no to you selling us out to the World Health Organization.
[19:47.000 --> 19:50.000]  We say no to you getting us into World War III.
[19:50.000 --> 19:51.000]  You're right.
[19:51.000 --> 19:55.000]  We stand against autocrats like you, Joe Biden, and we say no.
[19:55.000 --> 20:24.000]  And we say no to your war.
[20:24.000 --> 20:29.000]  All right, we got some big guests coming up the second and third hour into the fourth
[20:29.000 --> 20:30.000]  hour today.
[20:30.000 --> 20:34.000]  I'll tell you more about that as we get close to the end of the hour, which is still 48
[20:34.000 --> 20:35.000]  minutes away.
[20:35.000 --> 20:39.000]  Okay, let's get back to the huge congressional hearings yesterday.
[20:39.000 --> 20:43.000]  And then there's so much more I'm going to be getting into after that.
[20:43.000 --> 20:47.000]  A House panel has launched an investigation into the defunct January 6 committee.
[20:47.000 --> 20:51.000]  Something Steve Bannon was calling for the last few days.
[20:51.000 --> 20:59.000]  We have got major developments with the World Health Organization, UN Global Pandemic Treaty,
[20:59.000 --> 21:03.000]  and a lot of big developments on the COVID-19 front.
[21:03.000 --> 21:04.000]  We knew this was coming.
[21:04.000 --> 21:06.000]  It's globally standardized.
[21:06.000 --> 21:10.000]  Chickens kept in gardens will have to be registered under planned new rules.
[21:10.000 --> 21:14.000]  That's what they call pieces of property around your house in the UK.
[21:14.000 --> 21:19.000]  In the name of fighting bird flu, they want to register all small farms so they can shut
[21:19.000 --> 21:21.000]  them down.
[21:21.000 --> 21:25.000]  Just like they're trying to shut down gas stoves and space heaters all over the world.
[21:25.000 --> 21:30.000]  And then when they publicly propose it here in the US, and we say we don't want it, they
[21:30.000 --> 21:32.000]  make fun of us and say nobody proposed it.
[21:32.000 --> 21:36.000]  We've got the Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm on that coming up as well.
[21:36.000 --> 21:40.000]  But I want to get back to the war on the press.
[21:40.000 --> 21:42.000]  It's a lot bigger than that.
[21:42.000 --> 21:48.000]  It's a consortium directed by the Carnegie, Ford and Rockefeller endowments that create
[21:48.000 --> 21:50.000]  the original master policy.
[21:50.000 --> 21:55.000]  Then it had been going on for decades secretly, but it accelerated under Obama.
[21:55.000 --> 21:58.000]  Then when Trump went in, he basically kept his people in government.
[21:58.000 --> 22:00.000]  So Trump was never fully president.
[22:00.000 --> 22:03.000]  They could then undermine, they could spy, they could surveil.
[22:03.000 --> 22:08.000]  They then fired up all these think tanks and all these quote, news watch fact checker groups.
[22:08.000 --> 22:14.000]  All these big universities got involved, big corporations, dinosaur media, big tech.
[22:14.000 --> 22:19.000]  And they created all these different software systems where the different levels of the spies
[22:19.000 --> 22:25.000]  and operatives to communicate and coordinate with law firms, suing people, lawfare, all of it.
[22:25.000 --> 22:30.000]  Debanking, harassing people, sending antifreeze to people's houses when they chose to do so.
[22:30.000 --> 22:38.000]  This is a full, high tech, political, repression, totalitarian mechanism.
[22:38.000 --> 22:43.000]  The worst the world's ever seen makes the Stasi in East Germany blush.
[22:43.000 --> 22:48.000]  Makes anything the Chai comms have thought up look unsophisticated.
[22:48.000 --> 22:51.000]  Because the Chinese know they're under control, know there's a little credit score.
[22:51.000 --> 22:57.000]  This is a social credit score being slid in under the radar in front of everybody.
[22:57.000 --> 22:59.000]  So it's hiding in plain view.
[22:59.000 --> 23:03.000]  So if you just admit it's going on, admit it's illegal, it'll start falling like dominoes.
[23:03.000 --> 23:07.000]  I'm going to hit this big clip dealing with the level of the control
[23:07.000 --> 23:10.000]  and how it causes massive death in a moment.
[23:10.000 --> 23:14.000]  But first, Info Wars is the recognized canary in the cold mind.
[23:14.000 --> 23:17.000]  Info Wars is the recognized standard of resistance.
[23:17.000 --> 23:20.000]  The enemy wants it shut down, they want it destroyed.
[23:20.000 --> 23:24.000]  We have fearlessly fought on and you have done an amazing job spreading the word,
[23:24.000 --> 23:26.000]  trying to broadcast and buying product.
[23:26.000 --> 23:31.000]  But I really need people that have been on the fence that could redouble their efforts,
[23:31.000 --> 23:34.000]  spreading the articles and videos and clips to reach more people.
[23:34.000 --> 23:40.000]  And I need listeners and viewers that have never gone to InfoWarsTour.com to go there.
[23:40.000 --> 23:45.000]  We have the best CBD oil for half off what it is anywhere else, highest quality,
[23:45.000 --> 23:49.000]  what it does for your joints, your bones, inflammation, your neurons, your brain.
[23:49.000 --> 23:52.000]  Just look into this wide spectrum CBD oil.
[23:52.000 --> 23:54.000]  It's a gift that God gave us.
[23:54.000 --> 24:03.000]  We have three different types, 25 milligram, 10 milligram and 1000 milligram.
[24:03.000 --> 24:05.000]  And it's powerful stuff.
[24:05.000 --> 24:07.000]  It's at InfoWarsTour.com. Get it today.
[24:07.000 --> 24:09.000]  You need it in your medicine cabinet.
[24:09.000 --> 24:12.000]  You need it. You need to have it. Get it today.
[24:12.000 --> 24:17.000]  Also, we have the great ultimate bone broth that's been sold out for over two years,
[24:17.000 --> 24:20.000]  reformulated even stronger and better with the turmeric, the chagat mushroom,
[24:20.000 --> 24:22.000]  the bee pollen, the list goes on and on, the magnesium.
[24:22.000 --> 24:25.000]  It's back in stock discounted at InfoWarsTour.com.
[24:25.000 --> 24:28.000]  Incredible it does for your whole body, your immune system.
[24:28.000 --> 24:30.000]  It's just as strong as an ox.
[24:30.000 --> 24:33.000]  InfoWarsTour.com, the prebiotics sold out for over a year.
[24:33.000 --> 24:36.000]  That loved formula is now back.
[24:36.000 --> 24:40.000]  What it does for your gut flora and your intestines and your health is phenomenal.
[24:40.000 --> 24:49.000]  Get it at InfoWarsTour.com or triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine.
[24:49.000 --> 24:54.000]  And by the way, for last year when we had like three customer service people to take calls
[24:54.000 --> 24:57.000]  and they did okay, they were overwhelmed sometimes.
[24:57.000 --> 25:01.000]  We've hired four more people and I would say our customer service that was A plus
[25:01.000 --> 25:05.000]  during all the crises last few years went down to about a C plus.
[25:05.000 --> 25:08.000]  It's back to an A plus right now when you call the toll free number for any questions
[25:08.000 --> 25:11.000]  or information or order over the phone.
[25:11.000 --> 25:15.000]  Triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine.
[25:15.000 --> 25:16.000]  That is the number as well.
[25:16.000 --> 25:18.000]  I want to thank you all for your support.
[25:18.000 --> 25:22.000]  You want the nitric boost as well for your heart cardiovascular system.
[25:22.000 --> 25:23.000]  We've got our turmeric 95.
[25:23.000 --> 25:24.000]  That's the name of the product.
[25:24.000 --> 25:28.000]  It's the same formula as body's ultimate terming formula.
[25:28.000 --> 25:31.000]  It's just directly from the folks we were already buying it from.
[25:31.000 --> 25:33.000]  So we were able to cut the price some.
[25:33.000 --> 25:35.000]  It's available and does amazing things as well.
[25:35.000 --> 25:37.000]  InfoWarsTour.com.
[25:37.000 --> 25:39.000]  Okay, let's get to this.
[25:39.000 --> 25:49.000]  Representative Kat Kamek and Michael Schellenberger discussed Twitter censoring Stanford professors
[25:49.000 --> 25:55.000]  and Dr. Fauci basically running it and calling for a published takedown while he runs around
[25:55.000 --> 25:58.000]  in the public saying he never ran a censorship or wasn't involved in it.
[25:58.000 --> 25:59.000]  He's a criminal liar.
[25:59.000 --> 26:00.000]  Here it is.
[26:00.000 --> 26:05.000]  Up on the screen, you can see a email from October of 2020.
[26:05.000 --> 26:11.000]  This is from then NIH director Francis Collins to Dr. Anthony Fauci.
[26:11.000 --> 26:18.000]  It goes on in to say this proposal talking about the Great Barrington Declaration is
[26:18.000 --> 26:23.000]  from three fringe epidemiologists who met with the secretary and it seems to be getting
[26:23.000 --> 26:29.000]  a lot of attention, even a signature, a co-signature from a Nobel Prize winner.
[26:29.000 --> 26:31.000]  Key line in here that I would like to point out.
[26:31.000 --> 26:38.000]  There needs to be a quote quick and devastating published takedown of its premises.
[26:38.000 --> 26:41.000]  I don't see anything like that online yet.
[26:41.000 --> 26:42.000]  Is it underway?
[26:42.000 --> 26:44.000]  Signed Francis.
[26:44.000 --> 26:51.000]  Now what I find interesting is if you fast forward into June of 2021, the Biden administration
[26:51.000 --> 26:54.000]  was raging at social media companies.
[26:54.000 --> 27:00.000]  There is communications that we can produce for the record that state we would like you
[27:00.000 --> 27:04.000]  to combat quote unquote misinformation.
[27:04.000 --> 27:09.000]  Now, we, thanks to the Twitter files, know that Twitter executives were using the term
[27:09.000 --> 27:14.000]  visibility filtering and that really to the rest of the American general public was shadow
[27:14.000 --> 27:15.000]  banning.
[27:15.000 --> 27:16.000]  Correct?
[27:16.000 --> 27:17.000]  Yes.
[27:17.000 --> 27:18.000]  Okay.
[27:18.000 --> 27:27.000]  So all of a sudden we saw a rash of blacklist created by Twitter at the highest levels that
[27:27.000 --> 27:34.000]  were taking down some of the signatories and creators of this very Barrington Declaration.
[27:34.000 --> 27:35.000]  Correct?
[27:35.000 --> 27:40.000]  I think about Acharya, the Stanford professor who I don't think anybody considers a fringe
[27:40.000 --> 27:44.000]  epidemiologist was indeed, I'm sorry, I didn't piece it together.
[27:44.000 --> 27:46.000]  By the way, let's hit pause.
[27:46.000 --> 27:49.000]  We're going to come back, back to some 10 seconds and play the rest of it because we're
[27:49.000 --> 27:56.000]  going to break here, but you understand that during the red scare and all of it, a few
[27:56.000 --> 28:00.000]  thousand admitted communists had their rights violated and I'm against that because we don't
[28:00.000 --> 28:02.000]  want to become what we're fighting.
[28:02.000 --> 28:05.000]  Probably wouldn't have left the greatest evil the planet ever saw.
[28:05.000 --> 28:11.000]  This is millions of people being shadow banned and surveilled and tracked just because they
[28:11.000 --> 28:18.000]  were telling the truth and this is prestigious top university heads of departments with their
[28:18.000 --> 28:25.000]  Barrington Declaration where it caused massive suicide, the mass caused bacterial pneumonia,
[28:25.000 --> 28:31.000]  huge amounts of depression, retarding the growth of children, causing millions to starve to
[28:31.000 --> 28:32.000]  death in the third world.
[28:32.000 --> 28:33.000]  I mean, it was horrible.
[28:33.000 --> 28:37.000]  It was a horrible, globalist lockdown on the planet and so a bunch of scientists get together
[28:37.000 --> 28:41.000]  and point that out and point out other inconsistencies and they're like, this is too devastating.
[28:41.000 --> 28:45.000]  We want it shut down and indeed it did then get shut down.
[28:45.000 --> 28:50.000]  I mean, again, organized massive criminal activity, way bigger than left versus right.
[28:50.000 --> 28:54.000]  This is just total control and it's just the beginning if they're not stopped.
[28:54.000 --> 29:01.000]  The good news is the dam has broken, stay with us.
[29:01.000 --> 29:07.000]  Right now, I'm not talking to the viewers and listeners that have gone to infowarstore.com
[29:07.000 --> 29:11.000]  and gotten the great products that enrich your life, that empower your immune system
[29:11.000 --> 29:13.000]  and your body and keep us on air.
[29:13.000 --> 29:18.000]  I am humbly, hand in hand, talking to the viewers and listeners that have tuned in many of you
[29:18.000 --> 29:21.000]  for years and never gone to infowarstore.com.
[29:21.000 --> 29:27.000]  We know the vast, vast, vast, vast majority of you never actually go to infowarstore.com
[29:27.000 --> 29:30.000]  and never experience these great products and never find the operation.
[29:30.000 --> 29:34.000]  Sure, you share a link, you share an article, you tell folks about the show, that's great
[29:34.000 --> 29:35.000]  and I thank you.
[29:35.000 --> 29:39.000]  But we need funds to operate plus we've got really great products that do amazing things

[32:46.000 --> 32:51.000]  and I'm not going to sign anymore after that, are exclusively available at infowarstore.com as well.
[32:51.000 --> 32:54.000]  In the last month I got a little busy so I didn't sign the books, we didn't have them for sale
[32:54.000 --> 33:04.000]  but now I sign the last books and get them right down.
[33:25.000 --> 33:29.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:29.000 --> 33:32.000]  We are the battering ram.
[33:32.000 --> 33:37.000]  We are the juggernaut.
[33:37.000 --> 33:43.000]  We are the truth's weapon platform.
[33:43.000 --> 33:47.000]  We are at war with the tyrants.
[33:47.000 --> 33:51.000]  We are the infowar.
[33:51.000 --> 33:55.000]  All right, my wonderful listeners and viewers.
[33:55.000 --> 33:59.000]  I could spend the whole four hour show on this but let's just get through more of these clips now
[33:59.000 --> 34:01.000]  and then I got a bunch of other news to hit.
[34:01.000 --> 34:03.000]  But this is historic.
[34:03.000 --> 34:08.000]  The corporate media and the rest of the criminals that are all complicit
[34:08.000 --> 34:13.000]  to continue to gaslight you and say, we're not surveilling you, we're not censoring you, it doesn't exist.
[34:13.000 --> 34:15.000]  Remember four and a half years ago when they were deplatforming me, they said,
[34:15.000 --> 34:19.000]  Jones made up a term, deplatforming, even though we had the documents.
[34:19.000 --> 34:22.000]  Made it the term shadow banning, why we don't do that?
[34:22.000 --> 34:24.000]  Why government's not involved?
[34:24.000 --> 34:26.000]  I'm like, here's the damn documents.
[34:26.000 --> 34:33.000]  Obama put this in place in his last month in office in 2016.
[34:33.000 --> 34:36.000]  So it's so frustrating when we've known all this for a long time
[34:36.000 --> 34:40.000]  but the goodness is the public's finally getting it.
[34:40.000 --> 34:44.000]  Just three years ago I confronted Sundar Pachai, the head of Google
[34:44.000 --> 34:49.000]  and some of these kangaroo hearings and in that same hearing where I was being attacked but couldn't testify
[34:49.000 --> 34:58.000]  as I sat there listening to him testify in the room,
[34:58.000 --> 35:02.000]  they went back to an old thing about, is it true Google can track your location?
[35:02.000 --> 35:04.000]  No sir, we don't do that.
[35:04.000 --> 35:09.000]  That's like saying the sun doesn't come up or isn't yellow or that water isn't wet.
[35:09.000 --> 35:12.000]  But forever they would not even tell them they were tracking people
[35:12.000 --> 35:18.000]  because the Congress was so technologically illiterate.
[35:18.000 --> 35:22.000]  But now you notice the growth curve of knowledge is here.
[35:22.000 --> 35:25.000]  Now they know everything is being told alive by Big Tech
[35:25.000 --> 35:29.000]  who again is the consortium that lets all this tyranny take place.
[35:29.000 --> 35:34.000]  They'll finish up the clip talking about the Great Barrington Declaration
[35:34.000 --> 35:39.000]  and these top professors and how Fauci and others had their minions censor it
[35:39.000 --> 35:41.000]  and they gave the order and it happened.
[35:41.000 --> 35:47.000]  Jay Bhattacharya, the Stanford professor who I don't think anybody considers a fringe epidemiologist
[35:47.000 --> 35:54.000]  was indeed, I'm sorry I didn't piece it together, he was indeed visibility filters.
[35:54.000 --> 36:04.000]  Correct. And so this blacklist that was created that really was used to de-platform, reduce visibility,
[36:04.000 --> 36:12.000]  create lists internally where people couldn't even see their profiles, that was used against doctors
[36:12.000 --> 36:18.000]  and scientists who produced information that was contrary to what the CDC was putting out
[36:18.000 --> 36:24.000]  despite the fact that we now know that what they were publishing had scientific basis
[36:24.000 --> 36:26.000]  and in fact was valid.
[36:26.000 --> 36:30.000]  Absolutely and not only that but these are secret blacklists.
[36:30.000 --> 36:33.000]  So Professor Bhattacharya had no idea he was on it.
[36:33.000 --> 36:39.000]  I mean this is East Germany, Stasi kind of behavior, that's what this is.
[36:39.000 --> 36:43.000]  And the Great Barrington Declaration by the way, I was skeptical of it at the time
[36:43.000 --> 36:50.000]  but it actually now looks pretty good in terms of how it responds to COVID
[36:50.000 --> 36:55.000]  but even if it was totally wrong it still deserved, I mean this is the whole point of the First Amendment
[36:55.000 --> 37:00.000]  is that I think we all have the experience of you're not right until you're wrong a lot.
[37:00.000 --> 37:04.000]  You actually have to have that debate in that conversation so by repressing that
[37:04.000 --> 37:08.000]  we actually stifled I think a much broader conversation we could have had
[37:08.000 --> 37:15.000]  about how to effectively respond to COVID because they were secretly blacklisting people like Jay Bhattacharya.
[37:15.000 --> 37:22.000]  And once it's not secret the criminal activity can be exposed, documented and defeated.
[37:22.000 --> 37:26.000]  So this is the moment we've reached, it's a very important moment
[37:26.000 --> 37:33.000]  and citizenship isn't just medical, it's elections, it's how they gain knowledge and information stories
[37:33.000 --> 37:38.000]  so you can't see something like the 100 Biden laptop they knew was real to manipulate elections.
[37:38.000 --> 37:44.000]  At that level they did interfere massively in the elections 100 times what the Russians could ever dream of
[37:44.000 --> 37:47.000]  and it was the criminals that have hijacked this country that did it.
[37:47.000 --> 37:52.000]  They did steal the 2020 election just by algorithmic manipulation of the news
[37:52.000 --> 37:57.000]  and election information where 98% of it was pro-democrat in major studies.
[37:57.000 --> 38:03.000]  Now here is Congressman Thomas Massey discusses Pfizer board member Scott Gottlieb's role
[38:03.000 --> 38:09.000]  in censoring tweets about natural immunity which is a known fact. Here it is.
[38:09.000 --> 38:14.000]  I also found as a result of the FOIA CDC tracks every tweet that a Congressman puts out.
[38:14.000 --> 38:18.000]  Not just Republican but Democrat. They keep a spreadsheet, they make it every week.
[38:18.000 --> 38:22.000]  This showed up in the FOIA for me because I'm in their spreadsheet that they track.
[38:22.000 --> 38:25.000]  Why is this interesting? Okay so they're tracking Congressman's tweets at CDC,
[38:25.000 --> 38:30.000]  they're enrolled in the partner support portal at Twitter
[38:30.000 --> 38:34.000]  and then I found, this is why, I found Alex Berenson's report very interesting
[38:34.000 --> 38:39.000]  because what he found out is that Scott Gottlieb worked hard and Twitter complied
[38:39.000 --> 38:43.000]  it looks like to censor a tweet from a doctor about natural immunity.
[38:43.000 --> 38:48.000]  Like guess what, on the same day that that doctor's tweet was censored, so were my tweets
[38:48.000 --> 38:52.000]  on natural immunity. Why is this important? What is consequential about the date?
[38:52.000 --> 38:57.000]  This is three days after the military vaccine mandate came out and a week before
[38:57.000 --> 39:03.000]  the federal vaccine mandates came out, this truth was toxic to a narrative
[39:03.000 --> 39:06.000]  that Pfizer was spreading, that Joe Biden wanted out there so that he could force the vaccine
[39:06.000 --> 39:09.000]  on everybody whether you had natural immunity or not.
[39:09.000 --> 39:13.000]  I actually, you guys might not agree with me on this, I don't think the press gets special privileges
[39:13.000 --> 39:17.000]  on the First Amendment, I think, I don't think Congress does, I think every American
[39:17.000 --> 39:21.000]  by virtue of being an American has the right to free speech enshrined in the Constitution.
[39:21.000 --> 39:26.000]  So I'm not so much worried that they censored us, a Congressman,
[39:26.000 --> 39:29.000]  but they disabled all the comments from my constituents.
[39:29.000 --> 39:33.000]  Those are the voices they squelched and my beef is not with Twitter,
[39:33.000 --> 39:37.000]  but my beef is with the CDC and these federal agencies and I encourage you all
[39:37.000 --> 39:41.000]  if you can to find more about this and either of you have any comments on this.
[39:41.000 --> 39:45.000]  And what is the federal government doing with spy agencies in the Justice Department
[39:45.000 --> 39:49.000]  in league with the CDC secretly doing all this?
[39:49.000 --> 39:52.000]  Again, that's illegal beyond imagination.
[39:52.000 --> 39:57.000]  Now I'm going to say something here really important for all the other talk show hosts
[39:57.000 --> 40:00.000]  and all the other members of Congress, everybody else is tuned in right now.
[40:00.000 --> 40:04.000]  Listen to me, I've been proven right ahead of everybody else
[40:04.000 --> 40:07.000]  because I actually do the deep research. This is all I do.
[40:07.000 --> 40:10.000]  My heads in the game. Listen to me.
[40:10.000 --> 40:14.000]  Do you know what the problem is with these hearings?
[40:14.000 --> 40:17.000]  Do you know what the problem is with all this?
[40:17.000 --> 40:19.000]  Think about it.
[40:19.000 --> 40:26.000]  We owe Elon Musk a great debt of gratitude regardless of who he really is
[40:26.000 --> 40:30.000]  because these are good actions and Christ said you judge a tree by its fruits.
[40:30.000 --> 40:39.000]  This is open to window into this criminal activity, but Twitter is the junior tech company of the Big Five.
[40:39.000 --> 40:45.000]  It's the smallest of the apples and the Googles and the Facebooks and all the rest of it.
[40:45.000 --> 40:49.000]  And there's subsidiaries, okay?
[40:49.000 --> 40:55.000]  They're doing all of this with the same groups the exact same way at all the other platforms.
[40:55.000 --> 41:01.000]  And so we're all talking about Twitter as if it's only happening over here.
[41:01.000 --> 41:06.000]  No, it's happening all over the place and while we're all focused on Twitter,
[41:06.000 --> 41:09.000]  we need to be understanding that the evidence is everywhere else in the other groups
[41:09.000 --> 41:17.000]  and we need to get Googled and Facebook and their YouTube and Instagram subsidiaries exposed here.
[41:17.000 --> 41:22.000]  Now separately, what is the system doing to distract from this?
[41:22.000 --> 41:26.000]  They're still trying to suppress it. They're still censoring on YouTube and everywhere else.
[41:26.000 --> 41:32.000]  J6, they're putting labels on and blocking when you expose real J6 or when you expose the Twitter files.
[41:32.000 --> 41:34.000]  You go to YouTube, they're blocking that.
[41:34.000 --> 41:40.000]  Well, they're putting informational disinformation links and they're saying that is it true when it is.
[41:40.000 --> 41:44.000]  So they're still doing it. They're still shadow banning. They're still outright banning.
[41:44.000 --> 41:47.000]  They're still demonetizing. They're still harassing.
[41:47.000 --> 41:55.000]  And this is a social credit score. And while all that's going on, Jill Biden and Anthony Blinken
[41:55.000 --> 42:01.000]  are presenting an International Women of Courage Award to a biological man of International Women's Day at the White House.
[42:01.000 --> 42:04.000]  And Hershey's making a man their woman's spokesperson.
[42:04.000 --> 42:11.000]  So they're total distraction, diversion, destabilization of civilization with a bunch of clown world stuff about,
[42:11.000 --> 42:16.000]  oh, look, we have a man that's a woman that's an admiral that's number two in the Department of Health.
[42:16.000 --> 42:20.000]  And it's all just to scramble our brains. Here's the ridiculous award. We'll go to break.
[42:20.000 --> 42:23.000]  We'll come right back. Leave some bigger news. Stay with us.
[42:23.000 --> 42:31.000]  In Argentina, Alba Ruada is a transgender woman who was kicked out of classrooms, barred for sitting for exams,
[42:31.000 --> 42:36.000]  refused job opportunities, subjected to violence and rejected by her family.
[42:36.000 --> 42:45.000]  But in the face of these challenges, she worked to end violence and discrimination against the LGBTQI plus community in Argentina.
[42:45.000 --> 42:52.000]  So they're taking everybody's rights and then holding up a man saying a man's really a woman as everybody's rights.
[42:52.000 --> 42:56.000]  It's absolute crap, ladies and gentlemen. We'll be right back. Stay with us.
[43:00.000 --> 43:08.000]  Right now, I'm not talking to the viewers and listeners that have gone to info.store.com and gotten the great products
[43:08.000 --> 43:12.000]  that enrich your life, that empower your immune system and your body and keep us on air.
[43:12.000 --> 43:18.000]  I am humbly, hand in hand, talking to the viewers and listeners that have tuned in many of you for years
[43:18.000 --> 43:26.000]  and never gone to info.store.com. We know the vast, vast, vast, vast majority of you never actually go to info.store.com
[43:26.000 --> 43:29.000]  and never experience these great products and never find the operation.
[43:29.000 --> 43:34.000]  Sure, you share a link, you share an article, you tell books about the show. That's great. I thank you.
[43:34.000 --> 43:39.000]  But we need funds to operate. Plus, we've got really great products that do amazing things for people like our CBD oil
[43:39.000 --> 43:44.000]  and our fizzy magnesium and our sweet bait and our nitric oxide and our real Red Pill Plus.
[43:44.000 --> 43:48.000]  All of these are really great products that keep us on air. Plus, you're missing out on these products.
[43:48.000 --> 43:54.000]  So get off the bench, get in the game, step to the plate and go to info.store.com right now
[43:54.000 --> 44:20.000]  and get these great info or products at infoorstore.com.
[44:20.000 --> 44:24.000]  It's a BIA that manipulates the news in the United States.
[44:24.000 --> 44:28.000]  They took the babies out of 80 bears and left the children to die on a cold spot.
[44:28.000 --> 44:32.000]  It was almost as if it were a plan in motion. Get your pants in.
[44:32.000 --> 44:36.000]  We need you to go into the capital! That's the plan!
[44:36.000 --> 44:38.000]  You will always have conspiracy theories.
[44:38.000 --> 44:40.000]  They are nothing but distract.
[44:40.000 --> 44:44.000]  You guys censored Harvard-educated doctors. You silenced those voices.
[44:44.000 --> 44:48.000]  What we want to do in Davos is crush the reset button.
[44:48.000 --> 44:55.000]  As soon as we start exposing the great reset, the soon as these globalists start going to prison!
[45:18.000 --> 45:24.000]  It's a BIA that manipulates the news in the United States.
[45:24.000 --> 45:28.000]  They took the babies out of 80 bears and left the children to die on a cold spot.
[45:28.000 --> 45:32.000]  It was almost as if it were a plan in motion. Get your pants in.
[45:32.000 --> 45:36.000]  We need you to go into the capital! That's the plan!
[45:36.000 --> 45:38.000]  You will always have conspiracy theories.
[45:38.000 --> 45:40.000]  They are nothing but distract.
[45:40.000 --> 45:44.000]  You guys censored Harvard-educated doctors. You silenced those voices.
[45:44.000 --> 45:48.000]  What we want to do in Davos is crush the reset button.
[45:48.000 --> 46:14.000]  As soon as we start exposing the great reset, the soon as these globalists start going to prison!
[46:19.000 --> 46:24.000]  We want to encourage those of you who have been on the fence,
[46:24.000 --> 46:29.000]  and I have never gone to infowars.com to go there and get the great books, films,
[46:29.000 --> 46:35.000]  and supplements and survival gear that won't just empower you and enrich your life,
[46:35.000 --> 46:38.000]  but will keep this broadcast transmitting.
[46:38.000 --> 46:43.000]  Whether it's Red Pill Plus, Super High Quality CBD Oil, 50% Off,
[46:43.000 --> 46:48.000]  Great Physiomagnetism product, or whether it's Down and Out, or Sleep Bay that's back in stock,
[46:48.000 --> 46:49.000]  it's all there.
[46:49.000 --> 46:52.000]  Our turmeric, 95% Humanoid, strongest out there, turmeric 95,
[46:52.000 --> 46:56.000]  it's all available at infowars.com and it keeps it on the air.
[46:56.000 --> 47:21.000]  So make the decision to enrich your life and keep us on air at infowars.com.
[47:21.000 --> 47:34.000]  All right, so I don't understand how I can see the whole thing crystal clear,
[47:34.000 --> 47:36.000]  how the whole thing operates, how it all works.
[47:36.000 --> 47:42.000]  I told you six, seven years ago how the whole operation is done, how it all intersects,
[47:42.000 --> 47:45.000]  how it's all connected from human intelligence sources research,
[47:45.000 --> 47:49.000]  just understanding and it's not that hard if you actually want to put the pieces together.
[47:49.000 --> 47:53.000]  But most people look at things one-dimensionally or maybe two-dimensionally.
[47:53.000 --> 47:55.000]  And they don't have a historical context.
[47:55.000 --> 47:56.000]  Let me explain this again.
[47:56.000 --> 47:59.000]  Twitter is only the tip of the iceberg.
[47:59.000 --> 48:03.000]  It's only the doorway we've blown open to confirm everything we already told you,
[48:03.000 --> 48:06.000]  exactly as we told you on record.
[48:06.000 --> 48:10.000]  And we've been totally vindicated, you've been vindicated, we've all been vindicated,
[48:10.000 --> 48:17.000]  but now we've got to bring them to justice because the next leg of this should be congressional hearings
[48:17.000 --> 48:22.000]  showing clips seven years ago, six years ago, five years ago, three years ago, a year ago,
[48:22.000 --> 48:28.000]  with the executives from Twitter and Facebook and Google and all of them up there saying,
[48:28.000 --> 48:37.000]  we don't spy on anybody and watch what people say, we don't censor anybody, it doesn't exist, it's not happening.
[48:37.000 --> 48:41.000]  Meanwhile, they're watching congressman's accounts and banning them and shadow banning them.
[48:41.000 --> 48:47.000]  It's, I mean, Ron Paul, Ron Paul, Ron Paul too, Ron Paul.
[48:47.000 --> 48:50.000]  Two years ago, it was like natural immunity is better.
[48:50.000 --> 48:54.000]  All of a sudden he showed it in a Senate speech and YouTube banned it.
[48:54.000 --> 48:57.000]  Took it down and then Ron Paul got mad and went to rumble.
[48:57.000 --> 49:01.000]  Great go to rumble, but also be on YouTube, be on every platform.
[49:01.000 --> 49:03.000]  You're a senator, fight against them.
[49:03.000 --> 49:09.000]  A senator could be wrong, but you get a chance to hear him on the Senate floor.
[49:09.000 --> 49:11.000]  Remember Ron Paul?
[49:11.000 --> 49:13.000]  Five minutes in its speech.
[49:13.000 --> 49:22.000]  He's a medical doctor with poster boards up there talking about natural immunity.
[49:22.000 --> 49:26.000]  How the media was saying, oh, the science shows natural immunity doesn't exist.
[49:26.000 --> 49:28.000]  Remember that?
[49:28.000 --> 49:31.000]  And then, well, maybe it does a little something, but the shot's much better.
[49:31.000 --> 49:33.000]  All of it was a lie.
[49:33.000 --> 49:36.000]  The shot starts erasing your natural immunity on record.
[49:36.000 --> 49:38.000]  By five of them, you don't have one.
[49:38.000 --> 49:39.000]  The blood cells are turned off.
[49:39.000 --> 49:40.000]  It's called vades.
[49:40.000 --> 49:41.000]  That's the real thing.
[49:41.000 --> 49:42.000]  We coined the term.
[49:42.000 --> 49:43.000]  Now it's in the medical literature.
[49:43.000 --> 49:45.000]  That's what it is.
[49:45.000 --> 49:49.000]  So they lied to Congress.
[49:49.000 --> 49:51.000]  It's not just Fauci lying about gain of function.
[49:51.000 --> 49:52.000]  They lied about the censorship.
[49:52.000 --> 50:00.000]  They all did it in coordination while Trump's in office with a defense authorization of over $2 billion.
[50:00.000 --> 50:07.000]  Imagine if Nixon had all the corporations and all the groups in the media and tens of thousands of spies and operatives all organized.
[50:07.000 --> 50:10.000]  Illegally surveilling and censoring and spying.
[50:10.000 --> 50:13.000]  He got caught doing that.
[50:13.000 --> 50:20.000]  What if he put in the Defense Authorization Act in 1972 to do all this stuff but with low tech?
[50:20.000 --> 50:22.000]  They'd never let him put it in the defense bill.
[50:22.000 --> 50:24.000]  But it was in the defense bill.
[50:24.000 --> 50:25.000]  Almost no one was covering it.
[50:25.000 --> 50:26.000]  We were covering it.
[50:26.000 --> 50:27.000]  Zero Head was covering it.
[50:27.000 --> 50:31.000]  That's it.
[50:31.000 --> 50:37.000]  It's in the freaking legislation.
[50:37.000 --> 50:42.000]  And I can't believe Jim Jordan and them are this stupid that they didn't know this over the years.
[50:42.000 --> 50:44.000]  Now they get a lot of big tech money, folks.
[50:44.000 --> 50:46.000]  And the Republicans have been soft playing this.
[50:46.000 --> 50:47.000]  They've been back peddling.
[50:47.000 --> 50:49.000]  Trump back peddled and didn't do anything.
[50:49.000 --> 50:52.000]  Oh, he talked a lot about censorship but didn't do anything until he got censored.
[50:52.000 --> 50:53.000]  Now he calls it treason.
[50:53.000 --> 50:55.000]  It is treason.
[50:55.000 --> 50:59.000]  But when I was getting nailed to the wall and sued by the deep state and run over.
[50:59.000 --> 51:04.000]  I told all you, hey, they're coming for you next.
[51:04.000 --> 51:08.000]  Here's Jim Jordan yesterday on his opening statements.
[51:08.000 --> 51:11.000]  The truth is we want to focus on protecting the First Amendment.
[51:11.000 --> 51:14.000]  Mr. Stellenberger, are you a Republican?
[51:14.000 --> 51:15.000]  No, I'm not.
[51:15.000 --> 51:18.000]  You got any pro-Trump bumper stickers on your car?
[51:18.000 --> 51:19.000]  I voted for Biden.
[51:19.000 --> 51:20.000]  Voted for Biden.
[51:20.000 --> 51:22.000]  You know how many MAGA hats laying around your house, right?
[51:22.000 --> 51:23.000]  I do not.
[51:23.000 --> 51:29.000]  But you said earlier, both you and Mr. Tybee said this is the most chilling thing you've ever seen as journalists.
[51:29.000 --> 51:32.000]  Mr. Tybee, the same thing, you're not a Republican either, right?
[51:32.000 --> 51:33.000]  No.
[51:33.000 --> 51:34.000]  You didn't vote for Trump.
[51:34.000 --> 51:36.000]  This is about protecting the First Amendment.
[51:36.000 --> 51:40.000]  Mr. Tybee, I want to read from your Twitter file number nine.
[51:40.000 --> 51:46.000]  You say this, after weeks of Twitter files, the Bureau issued a statement Wednesday, referring to FBI.
[51:46.000 --> 51:47.000]  Here's what the FBI said.
[51:47.000 --> 51:55.000]  It is unfortunate that conspiracy theorists and others are feeding the American public misinformation with a sole purpose of attempting to discredit the agency.
[51:55.000 --> 51:56.000]  You then follow up.
[51:56.000 --> 51:57.000]  This is why I think you're award-winning author.
[51:57.000 --> 51:58.000]  You then follow up.
[51:58.000 --> 52:03.000]  They must think we're unambitious if our sole aim is to discredit the FBI.
[52:03.000 --> 52:08.000]  After all, a whole range of government agencies discredit themselves in the Twitter files.
[52:08.000 --> 52:14.000]  And then you go on to, in this particular Twitter file, talk about what Mr. Bishop was just talking about, the GEC at the State Department.
[52:14.000 --> 52:15.000]  You talk about the CIA.
[52:15.000 --> 52:16.000]  You talk about the DOD.
[52:16.000 --> 52:17.000]  You talk about the FBI.
[52:17.000 --> 52:18.000]  You talk about the DHS.
[52:18.000 --> 52:22.000]  You talk about the Foreign Intelligence Task Force, which is a combination of all these.
[52:22.000 --> 52:26.000]  But there was one agency you didn't mention, because you didn't know at the time.
[52:26.000 --> 52:33.000]  One agency, one, you had almost a whole alphabet, but you didn't mention one agency, the FTC.
[52:33.000 --> 52:35.000]  You know about them now.
[52:35.000 --> 52:36.000]  Yes, we do.
[52:36.000 --> 52:38.000]  We know about them now in an up-close and personal way.
[52:38.000 --> 52:41.000]  You didn't know then, but you do know now.
[52:41.000 --> 52:46.000]  December 2nd, as I said earlier, December 2nd, the first Twitter file comes out, Mr. Atayabe.
[52:46.000 --> 52:50.000]  And I think there are five others, including the ones from Mr. Schellenberger.
[52:50.000 --> 52:57.000]  December 13th, the very first letter that the FTC sends to Twitter after the Twitter files.
[52:57.000 --> 52:59.000]  Eleven days after the first Twitter file.
[52:59.000 --> 53:01.000]  Five of them come out.
[53:01.000 --> 53:07.000]  The FTC's first demand in that first letter after the Twitter files come out is identify all journalists.
[53:07.000 --> 53:14.000]  I'm quoting, identify all journalists and other members of the media to whom Twitter worked with.
[53:14.000 --> 53:21.000]  You find that scary, Mr. Atayabe, that you got a federal government agency asking a private company
[53:21.000 --> 53:24.000]  who in the press are you talking with?
[53:24.000 --> 53:26.000]  I do find it scary.
[53:26.000 --> 53:33.000]  I think it's none of the government's business with journalists a private company talks to and why.
[53:33.000 --> 53:37.000]  I think every journalist should be concerned about that.
[53:37.000 --> 53:44.000]  And the absence of interest in that issue by my fellow colleagues in the mainstream media
[53:44.000 --> 53:47.000]  is an indication of how low the business has sunk.
[53:47.000 --> 53:52.000]  There was once a real esprit de corps and camaraderie within media.
[53:52.000 --> 53:57.000]  Whenever one of us was gone after, we all kind of rose to the challenge and support.
[53:57.000 --> 53:58.000]  Used to be.
[53:58.000 --> 53:59.000]  Used to be the case.
[53:59.000 --> 54:01.000]  That is gone now.
[54:01.000 --> 54:03.000]  We don't protect one another.
[54:03.000 --> 54:04.000]  What else used to happen?
[54:04.000 --> 54:06.000]  Democrats used to care about protecting First Amendment free speech rights, too.
[54:06.000 --> 54:09.000]  Now it's like, okay, if you're attacking, and I said this on the House floor.
[54:09.000 --> 54:11.000]  I said, don't think they won't come for you.
[54:11.000 --> 54:17.000]  Oh, the big tech, big media, the cancel culture, they may come for Republicans and conservatives now,
[54:17.000 --> 54:19.000]  but they never, the mob is never satisfied.
[54:19.000 --> 54:21.000]  They will keep coming.
[54:21.000 --> 54:25.000]  Mr. Schellenberger, you know who the chair of the FTC is?
[54:25.000 --> 54:27.000]  Not personally.
[54:27.000 --> 54:28.000]  Lena Kahn.
[54:28.000 --> 54:30.000]  Lena Kahn, you know who she used to work for?
[54:30.000 --> 54:32.000]  My understanding is the Judiciary Committee?
[54:32.000 --> 54:33.000]  Yes, she's worked for these folks.
[54:33.000 --> 54:35.000]  These same folks have been attacking you today.
[54:35.000 --> 54:36.000]  Same folks.
[54:36.000 --> 54:39.000]  Chair of the FTC, work for them.
[54:39.000 --> 54:40.000]  Here's what they said.
[54:40.000 --> 54:43.000]  Here's what she said in one, in the letter where they ask about who these journalists,
[54:43.000 --> 54:48.000]  again, they named four personally, four journalists by name, you were two of the four.
[54:48.000 --> 54:54.000]  As I said before, I think it's frankly courageous and brave of you to show up today when you know the federal government's got an eye on you personally.
[54:54.000 --> 54:56.000]  Here's what they asked for in that letter.
[54:56.000 --> 55:01.000]  Any credentialing or background check Twitter has done on journalists.
[55:01.000 --> 55:02.000]  Now think about that.
[55:02.000 --> 55:07.000]  The federal government is saying we want you to do a background check on members of the press.
[55:07.000 --> 55:11.000]  Freedom of the press mentioned in the First Amendment and they're doing that.
[55:11.000 --> 55:16.000]  They want Twitter to do a background check on you before they can talk to you in America.
[55:16.000 --> 55:23.000]  The FTC, led by Lena Kahn, who used to work for these guys is asking that question.
[55:23.000 --> 55:29.000]  Now we know, now we all know why you guys said at the outset, this is the most chilling story.
[55:29.000 --> 55:33.000]  And you guys are New York Times bestsellers, award-winning journalists.
[55:33.000 --> 55:39.000]  But in all your time in the journalism field, this issue, most important.
[55:39.000 --> 55:43.000]  And how this, I think, what did you call it, Mr. Schellenberg, this complex, what did you call it?
[55:43.000 --> 55:45.000]  The censorship industrial complex.
[55:45.000 --> 55:46.000]  Totally.
[55:46.000 --> 55:52.000]  This web of censorship, big government, big tech, NGOs, all this web of censorship that Mr. Bishop was getting into in his line of questioning.
[55:52.000 --> 55:54.000]  That's what this committee is going to get to.
[55:54.000 --> 55:55.000]  And that's not right or left.
[55:55.000 --> 55:57.000]  That's not, this is just right or wrong.
[55:57.000 --> 55:58.000]  This is wrong.
[55:58.000 --> 56:02.000]  We know it's wrong and it's about protecting the First Amendment.
[56:02.000 --> 56:06.000]  Now, again, what's the big takeaway?
[56:06.000 --> 56:11.000]  We're now learning what we already told you exactly how it all works.
[56:11.000 --> 56:13.000]  It's already been public for many years.
[56:13.000 --> 56:17.000]  It's just getting worse by the day and bigger and more out of control, more weaponized.
[56:17.000 --> 56:22.000]  And this is not about the First Amendment.
[56:22.000 --> 56:26.000]  The First Amendment is one piece of it.
[56:26.000 --> 56:34.000]  It's government with intelligence agencies, big tech and dinosaur media in illegal consortiums,
[56:34.000 --> 56:40.000]  surveilling everyone with AI in live time, and then censoring everybody in live time,
[56:40.000 --> 56:45.000]  and then going out and harassing people, and in many cases, sending antithesis to their house.
[56:45.000 --> 56:49.000]  I can play you the congressional hearings four years ago where they would get up in the hearings
[56:49.000 --> 56:51.000]  and say, why is info wars number one on Twitter today?
[56:51.000 --> 56:56.000]  They said, sir, we saw it at lunch and we took it down.
[56:56.000 --> 56:59.000]  So they really have been schizophrenic about this.
[56:59.000 --> 57:00.000]  They'll admit they're doing it.
[57:00.000 --> 57:03.000]  They'll say they're not doing it, but it's racketeering.
[57:03.000 --> 57:10.000]  It's organized crime, this giant web, this giant consortium coming after everybody.
[57:10.000 --> 57:14.000]  This is dictatorship, digital dictatorship on everything.
[57:14.000 --> 57:16.000]  The end of free elections, the end of everything.
[57:16.000 --> 57:19.000]  If this doesn't get stopped, we need more than hearings.
[57:19.000 --> 57:23.000]  But the FBI won't indict anybody because they're at the center of it.
[57:23.000 --> 57:27.000]  This is a coup, folks, a digital technocracy coup.
[57:27.000 --> 57:32.000]  And info wars is the probe that's gone in through and beyond.
[57:32.000 --> 57:34.000]  But we're only here because of you.
[57:34.000 --> 57:36.000]  Please pray for us and please keep us on air.
[57:36.000 --> 57:41.000]  Go to infowarstore.com right now and underwrite us continuing in the fight.

[58:23.000 --> 58:27.000]  And there is a markup there because this is a fundraiser to keep us on the air.

[58:30.000 --> 58:33.000]  You'll also know that you help keep info wars on the air.
[58:33.000 --> 58:37.000]  I'm going to thank those of you that have gotten signed copies of the book or unsigned copies.
[58:37.000 --> 58:41.000]  But I want to encourage all of you who haven't yet to go to infowarstore.com
[58:41.000 --> 58:45.000]  and get a signed copy and buy a couple of unsigned copies and go to the library
[58:45.000 --> 58:47.000]  or give them to the local school.
[58:47.000 --> 58:50.000]  This is an info war. I'm counting on you and thank you for your support.
[58:50.000 --> 58:53.000]  There is a war for the future happening right now.
[58:53.000 --> 58:58.000]  There is a war that will control my destiny, your destiny, our children's destiny.
[58:58.000 --> 59:03.000]  And that war is something that we can win, but it takes dedication. It takes commitment.
[59:03.000 --> 59:07.000]  That's why I ask listeners, respectively, to go to infowarstore.com
[59:07.000 --> 59:13.000]  and buy great products that will enrich and empower your life while keeping us on air at the very same time.
[59:13.000 --> 59:16.000]  infowarstore.com
[59:16.000 --> 59:20.000]  To get a signed or unsigned copy of my book, The Great Reset and War for the World.
[59:20.000 --> 59:25.000]  Ultimate bone broth, back at stock, nitric boost, the amazing CBD oil we have
[59:25.000 --> 59:29.000]  that's the highest quality you're going to find anywhere at more than half off.
[59:29.000 --> 59:33.000]  It's all available at infowarstore.com, some of the very best products.
[59:33.000 --> 59:35.000]  And a lot of you have never shopped at infowarstore.
[59:35.000 --> 59:38.000]  You've been watching for years, you've been listening for years,
[59:38.000 --> 59:41.000]  but you've never taken the step to go to infowarstore.
[59:41.000 --> 59:45.000]  These are great products that really work and are amazing, plus they keep us on air.
[59:45.000 --> 59:49.000]  So again, please take action, go to infowarstore.com today.
[59:49.000 --> 59:51.000]  And I thank you.
[59:51.000 --> 01:00:00.000]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:05.000]  Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the U.S. Capitol Building.
[01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:10.000]  If you've joined us today for the insurrection, please make sure you pick up a promotional leaflet on the way in.
[01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000]  Stay inside the safety cordons at all times.
[01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:19.000]  Tucker Carlson opened a wormhole in the Congressional Country Club Spacetime January 6th Continuum,
[01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:25.000]  presenting unseen video footage revealing that the complete story had not only not been told,
[01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:30.000]  but it had also been doctored by the January 6th Committee to satiate
[01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:35.000]  the Trump Derangement Syndrome mental illness rampant in Washington, D.C.
[01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:39.000]  Footage from inside the Capitol overturns the story you've heard about January 6th.
[01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:42.000]  Protesters queue up in neat little lines.
[01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:45.000]  They give each other tours outside the Speaker's office.
[01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:49.000]  They're not destroying the Capitol, they obviously revere the Capitol.
[01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:55.000]  The controllers and their media minions went on the offensive, doubling down on the big lie,
[01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:59.000]  using the old tired strategy that had secured their positions.
[01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:04.000]  Lies baked into an unyielding barrage of mind control repetition.
[01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:09.000]  The power of repetition is such that people like Tucker Carlson,
[01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:14.000]  who know they're lying to the public, can convince tens of millions of people of those lies.
[01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:19.000]  Tucker Carlson took a page from George Orwell's 1984
[01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:25.000]  and told his viewers to reject the evidence of their eyes and ears.
[01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.000]  Is this a lie? I think it's bull.
[01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:32.000]  Fox Executive Hannity Carlson shows are not credible sources of news.
[01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:37.000]  A hundred officers were assaulted on that day, five officers died.
[01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:42.000]  Who are these five officers who were, quote, killed that day?
[01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:46.000]  Notice he didn't tell you, no one ever tells you, no one ever shows you their autopsies,
[01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:49.000]  they don't want any detail, they just want the slogan.
[01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:53.000]  Now they're counting Brian Sicknick, that's a lie, but who are the other four?
[01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000]  Well those are four officers who killed themselves.
[01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:58.000]  These are the facts they can't dispute.
[01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:04.000]  Here is surveillance footage of Sicknick walking in the Capitol after he was supposedly murdered by the mob outside.
[01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:08.000]  By all appearances, Sicknick is healthy and vigorous.
[01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:11.000]  He's wearing a helmet, so it's hard to imagine he was killed by a head injury.
[01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:16.000]  We do know from contemporaneous video tape that a mysterious figure called Ray Epps
[01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000]  encouraged the crowd to go into the Capitol.
[01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:21.000]  For some reason, Epps has never been indicted for that.
[01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.000]  But there's no question he didn't.
[01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:26.000]  We need to go into the Capitol!
[01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:31.000]  Why don't you guys open up the lesson?
[01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:36.000]  Because I think Epps is the only one.
[01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.000]  Do not go in there!
[01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000]  We did it!
[01:02:54.000 --> 01:03:05.900]  How, in a free country guided by the Constitution, were these people allowed to withhold evidence
[01:03:05.900 --> 01:03:07.760]  from Jacob Chansley's lawyer?
[01:03:07.760 --> 01:03:09.260]  How could that happen?
[01:03:09.260 --> 01:03:15.000]  Had you seen that clearly exculpatory tape of your client at trial?
[01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:16.000]  No.
[01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:17.000]  Where is your backup?
[01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:23.680]  This is our damn Capitol building, and you're only letting it get destroyed on your watch!
[01:03:23.680 --> 01:03:33.160]  We who watched that video with their own eyes in a real way would disagree with what was
[01:03:33.160 --> 01:03:34.160]  just stated.
[01:03:34.160 --> 01:03:38.120]  The President has been very clear January 6th was the worst attack on our democracy
[01:03:38.120 --> 01:03:40.120]  since the Civil War.
[01:03:40.120 --> 01:03:43.840]  The worst attack on our democracy since the Civil War.
[01:03:43.840 --> 01:03:49.640]  The weather underground setting off a bomb in the Capitol in 1971, and the armed resistance
[01:03:49.640 --> 01:03:56.800]  unit doing the same in the Senate in 1983 were the last major attacks on the U.S. Capitol.
[01:03:56.800 --> 01:04:01.880]  But there can be no mention of those attacks because it would surely open old wounds surrounding
[01:04:01.880 --> 01:04:07.000]  Obama's relationship with Bill Ayres and Bernadine Dorn, and Bill Clinton's pardoning
[01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:13.360]  of 16 members of the FALN who blew up innocent Americans at Francis Tavern, where George
[01:04:13.360 --> 01:04:18.160]  Washington said farewell to his officers in 1783.
[01:04:18.160 --> 01:04:21.760]  One number one, why did President Obama release the bomber?
[01:04:21.760 --> 01:04:24.440]  His name was Oster Lopez, why did he do it?
[01:04:24.440 --> 01:04:25.440]  Because he agreed with them.
[01:04:25.440 --> 01:04:29.880]  Lopez was the leader of the FALN who bombed Francis Tavern, they took responsibility for
[01:04:29.880 --> 01:04:30.880]  it.
[01:04:30.880 --> 01:04:36.000]  He was a Chicago guy, his brother, Jose, is a community organizer in Chicago, and he
[01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:40.160]  had sympathy, in my view, Obama's sympathy for these terrorists.
[01:04:40.160 --> 01:04:44.920]  There were going to be bombshells throughout the week, but it appears Tucker was finally
[01:04:44.920 --> 01:04:48.320]  roped in by Rupert Murdoch's lawyers.
[01:04:48.320 --> 01:04:53.680]  However, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy is now vowed to release the January 6th security
[01:04:53.680 --> 01:04:55.600]  footage to the general public.
[01:04:55.600 --> 01:04:58.360]  It belongs to the public after all.
[01:04:58.360 --> 01:05:28.280]  John Bowne reporting.
[01:05:28.280 --> 01:05:42.640]  Thank you.
[01:05:58.280 --> 01:06:02.520]  counting on you and thank you for your support.
[01:06:02.520 --> 01:06:09.120]  Waging War on Corruption, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of
[01:06:09.120 --> 01:06:10.120]  the Info War.
[01:06:10.120 --> 01:06:17.240]  All right, the lowest dimension I operate in is the third dimension.
[01:06:17.240 --> 01:06:21.560]  Our projections go all the way into the sixth dimension with incredible humance that God
[01:06:21.560 --> 01:06:25.520]  has given us known as the Holy Spirit.
[01:06:25.520 --> 01:06:30.080]  And to me, understanding all this is incredibly simple and it's like reading a owner's manual
[01:06:30.080 --> 01:06:31.080]  or something.
[01:06:31.080 --> 01:06:35.920]  But for the general public that's not shifted their mind into alien dialectics, that's only
[01:06:35.920 --> 01:06:37.760]  third dimensional thinking.
[01:06:37.760 --> 01:06:42.760]  Once you understand third dimensional thinking, you can expand to the higher levels and then
[01:06:42.760 --> 01:06:47.240]  permutate out on the larger analysis.
[01:06:47.240 --> 01:06:49.040]  That's called wargaming.
[01:06:49.040 --> 01:06:53.080]  So I wanted to get a really smart lawyer who's been at the tip of the spear getting the biggest
[01:06:53.080 --> 01:06:59.680]  whistleblowers like Dr. Huff and others who was the vice president of EcoHealth Alliance
[01:06:59.680 --> 01:07:02.960]  that basically ran so much of the attack we've seen.
[01:07:02.960 --> 01:07:07.920]  He's been really at the center of collating the information, bringing it together.
[01:07:07.920 --> 01:07:14.800]  And he also operates at a chess level, not a checkers level, of how it's all tied together.
[01:07:14.800 --> 01:07:18.960]  Biden rolling out the national ID with a casual society system for its social credit score.
[01:07:18.960 --> 01:07:19.960]  Utah just announced it.
[01:07:19.960 --> 01:07:22.160]  It has rolled it out yesterday.
[01:07:22.160 --> 01:07:23.920]  How it ties into war in Russia.
[01:07:23.920 --> 01:07:27.200]  How the new COVID origin bill is saying China did it.
[01:07:27.200 --> 01:07:28.200]  So we'll go to a war with China.
[01:07:28.200 --> 01:07:33.800]  And I hate Communist China, but you just heard Redfield, former head of the CDC say no.
[01:07:33.800 --> 01:07:37.960]  The Pentagon was running the operation, gained a function at Chapel Hill.
[01:07:37.960 --> 01:07:40.280]  Then they moved it to Wuhan.
[01:07:40.280 --> 01:07:41.280]  He's not perjuring himself.
[01:07:41.280 --> 01:07:43.000]  He's telling the truth.
[01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:49.280]  So when Obama got caught doing this in 2015, it was a big scandal in the news with major
[01:07:49.280 --> 01:07:55.000]  professors coming forward saying we shouldn't be weaponizing coronaviruses.
[01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:58.040]  They moved it to China so they could have plausible deniability.
[01:07:58.040 --> 01:08:04.680]  And later say, oh, it was from a bat at a wet supermarket where they saw live animals.
[01:08:04.680 --> 01:08:05.680]  That's a China played ball.
[01:08:05.680 --> 01:08:08.200]  But if China didn't play ball, oh, you did it.
[01:08:08.200 --> 01:08:09.200]  It's in your country.
[01:08:09.200 --> 01:08:10.760]  And it's not a consensus.
[01:08:10.760 --> 01:08:17.080]  It's a fact that Fauci of the deep state already had their so-called mRNA vaccines for COVID-19
[01:08:17.080 --> 01:08:18.080]  with the sequence ready.
[01:08:18.080 --> 01:08:21.160]  Moderna didn't crack the code in two days and come up with a vaccine.
[01:08:21.160 --> 01:08:22.560]  Oh, we just cracked it.
[01:08:22.560 --> 01:08:23.960]  The vaccine's ready in two days.
[01:08:23.960 --> 01:08:24.960]  They already had it.
[01:08:24.960 --> 01:08:25.960]  That's in the emails.
[01:08:25.960 --> 01:08:27.200]  It's all come out.
[01:08:27.200 --> 01:08:28.520]  So it is incredible.
[01:08:28.520 --> 01:08:31.240]  Now, we're watching Congress do catch up on all this.
[01:08:31.240 --> 01:08:34.600]  And for me, the first amendment's paramount in general for the public.
[01:08:34.600 --> 01:08:37.760]  But where we can nail them, they're focusing on free speech.
[01:08:37.760 --> 01:08:39.760]  It's not the free speech issue.
[01:08:39.760 --> 01:08:45.120]  It's that when you have government and agencies with big tech and dinosaur media lying and
[01:08:45.120 --> 01:08:49.680]  operating in secret in line to Congress about the last five, six years, censoring everybody
[01:08:49.680 --> 01:08:55.120]  in live time and controlling not just COVID narratives, but open border narratives, Afghan
[01:08:55.120 --> 01:08:58.200]  withdrawal narratives, election fraud narratives.
[01:08:58.200 --> 01:09:00.720]  I mean, they're now censoring January 6th stuff.
[01:09:00.720 --> 01:09:05.200]  They're now censoring on YouTube and other places and blocking these hearings you're
[01:09:05.200 --> 01:09:06.200]  watching.
[01:09:06.200 --> 01:09:11.720]  Again, a year and a half ago, two years ago, they blocked Senator Paul showing slides and
[01:09:11.720 --> 01:09:17.000]  printouts on poster board about natural immunity.
[01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:19.920]  And then to now come out the documents, they censor things that are true because that's
[01:09:19.920 --> 01:09:23.560]  so effective and against their narrative.
[01:09:23.560 --> 01:09:25.200]  It's all ends justifies the means.
[01:09:25.200 --> 01:09:34.200]  So Thomas Renz is at Renz Tom on Twitter, R-E-N-Z Tom and Tom Renz.substack.com and Renz-law.com.
[01:09:34.200 --> 01:09:39.480]  But it was the rest of the hour, but I want to set the table on the big picture here.
[01:09:39.480 --> 01:09:43.480]  Here is the first clip, we probably played 30 minutes of Redfield yesterday, but here's
[01:09:43.480 --> 01:09:48.600]  just that one clip and he elaborated later about, no, no, this is gain of function.
[01:09:48.600 --> 01:09:54.840]  This is the biggest disaster ever with gain of function here at us.
[01:09:54.840 --> 01:10:00.600]  So one other path of questioning for you, Dr. Redfield, proponents of this research claimant
[01:10:00.600 --> 01:10:04.720]  may result in vaccines or maybe even stop a pandemic.
[01:10:04.720 --> 01:10:09.360]  Dr. Redfield has gained a function, created any life-saving vaccines or therapeutics to
[01:10:09.360 --> 01:10:10.360]  your knowledge?
[01:10:10.360 --> 01:10:12.200]  Not to my knowledge.
[01:10:12.200 --> 01:10:16.560]  Has gain of function stopped a pandemic in your opinion?
[01:10:16.560 --> 01:10:20.560]  Now, on the contrary, I think it probably caused the greatest pandemic our world has
[01:10:20.560 --> 01:10:21.560]  seen.
[01:10:21.560 --> 01:10:27.120]  Do you find any tangible benefits to gain of function research at this time?
[01:10:27.120 --> 01:10:31.920]  I personally don't, but I do want to stress, I think the men and women that support it
[01:10:31.920 --> 01:10:36.680]  are people of good faith because they truly believe it's going to lead to a potential
[01:10:36.680 --> 01:10:37.680]  benefit.
[01:10:37.680 --> 01:10:40.400]  Do you agree with that assessment?
[01:10:40.400 --> 01:10:43.400]  And he went on and on to describe it all, and now the Pentagon is actually behind it.
[01:10:43.400 --> 01:10:44.400]  That is people running it.
[01:10:44.400 --> 01:10:47.760]  So Attorney Thomas Rins at the heart of the whistleblowers, everything we know coming
[01:10:47.760 --> 01:10:53.080]  out now, do you agree with me that the First Amendment issue, they're almost using the
[01:10:53.080 --> 01:10:54.080]  red herring?
[01:10:54.080 --> 01:10:55.080]  Yeah, they trampled it.
[01:10:55.080 --> 01:10:59.280]  Yeah, they did it, but it's the organized crime of all these groups together secretly
[01:10:59.280 --> 01:11:00.280]  doing this.
[01:11:00.280 --> 01:11:04.400]  When you organize to deprive massive groups of their rights, it's not just civil rights
[01:11:04.400 --> 01:11:08.640]  violations, it's serious crimes, especially when it's for big companies to make hundreds
[01:11:08.640 --> 01:11:09.800]  of billions of dollars.
[01:11:09.800 --> 01:11:11.960]  How would you quantify that?
[01:11:11.960 --> 01:11:15.400]  I'd quantify it as a RICO Act, Alex.
[01:11:15.400 --> 01:11:20.040]  So I'm going to tell you, I've looked at this for quite some time, and I'm of the belief
[01:11:20.040 --> 01:11:23.640]  that the largest RICO suit in history could, wouldn't, should be filed.
[01:11:23.640 --> 01:11:27.080]  Now, I'm going to tell you that the reason I haven't filed it is just simply that the
[01:11:27.080 --> 01:11:29.520]  complexity of it, I don't have the resources.
[01:11:29.520 --> 01:11:35.600]  I mean, you're talking about a five to ten million dollar case, and that's not because
[01:11:35.600 --> 01:11:36.600] ...
[01:11:36.600 --> 01:11:37.880]  Now, this is the biggest organized crime ever.
[01:11:37.880 --> 01:11:41.280]  You've got literally hundreds of companies and groups with government doing it, exactly.
[01:11:41.280 --> 01:11:43.840]  Yeah, I mean, here's the thing.
[01:11:43.840 --> 01:11:48.200]  You file this case, you're going to be filing against the World Economic Forum, all sorts
[01:11:48.200 --> 01:11:53.000]  of federal officials, and you can get to federal officials under RICO in certain instances.
[01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:59.120]  You can also get to these corrupt universities, to the Gates Foundation, all these different
[01:11:59.120 --> 01:12:00.900]  players that we know are a part of this.
[01:12:00.900 --> 01:12:04.680]  You could get to all of these guys under the proper RICO suit.
[01:12:04.680 --> 01:12:08.760]  I'm quite convinced of that, based on the evidence that we have in my pocket.
[01:12:08.760 --> 01:12:15.400]  The problem is, is that the complexity is so mind-blowing, it would probably, I would
[01:12:15.400 --> 01:12:20.160]  say, twenty-five to fifty attorneys, another twenty-five or so paralegals.
[01:12:20.160 --> 01:12:25.220]  I mean, you'd be looking at full time for probably six months to a year minimum to put
[01:12:25.220 --> 01:12:26.220]  us together.
[01:12:26.220 --> 01:12:31.080]  I mean, there's an old saying, we're going to commit a crime, commit a huge one, because
[01:12:31.080 --> 01:12:35.040]  it's such a massive consortium of corporate and governmental systems, that's why they
[01:12:35.040 --> 01:12:38.520]  thought they'd get away with it, because it's so huge, and they've got so many powerful
[01:12:38.520 --> 01:12:42.840]  people on board, they believe that political power will protect them.
[01:12:42.840 --> 01:12:46.840]  Well, Alex, you know this better than anybody on the planet, right?
[01:12:46.840 --> 01:12:52.240]  When the machine gears up against you in the courts, they've got infinite money.
[01:12:52.240 --> 01:12:54.960]  They don't care what it costs, right?
[01:12:54.960 --> 01:12:58.840]  You know, I don't want to make it a money thing about me, because that's not what I'm
[01:12:58.840 --> 01:13:02.680]  in this for, but let's use this as an example.
[01:13:02.680 --> 01:13:07.520]  Since I have started doing this work three years ago, and you know, I dedicate every
[01:13:07.520 --> 01:13:12.560]  waking minute, I have billed less than a million dollars for my time.
[01:13:12.560 --> 01:13:17.840]  Now, if you think about that, and you compare it to the amount of hours that I've worked,
[01:13:17.840 --> 01:13:23.840]  you're looking at, I've given away probably five, six million dollars worth of work.
[01:13:23.840 --> 01:13:25.640]  There aren't many lawyers that will do that.
[01:13:25.640 --> 01:13:26.640]  There just aren't.
[01:13:26.640 --> 01:13:31.400]  So, you know, the reality is, on these freebie cases that I do, and I do a lot of them,
[01:13:31.400 --> 01:13:35.440]  and I do as many as I can, you know, people say, where are the lawyers?
[01:13:35.440 --> 01:13:40.800]  Well, our side doesn't fund it, but when you have Google, when you have the Gates Foundation,
[01:13:40.800 --> 01:13:45.340]  when you have George Soros, what they do is they say, listen, I'll spend a hundred million
[01:13:45.340 --> 01:13:49.280]  dollars on lawyers, because I'm going to steal a trillion dollars worth of money from
[01:13:49.280 --> 01:13:51.840]  the public, and who cares, right?
[01:13:51.840 --> 01:13:57.200]  So when you look at it, this is really, it was actually part of the plan, was to make
[01:13:57.200 --> 01:14:02.680]  this financially untenable for lawyers to fight, so that they could get away with this.
[01:14:02.680 --> 01:14:07.640]  Because there are ways that we can do things, it's just no single lawyer, no, not even a
[01:14:07.640 --> 01:14:10.600]  small group of lawyers really has the capacity to do that.
[01:14:10.600 --> 01:14:13.920]  Well, that's right, they admit in their war games, they were planning for lawyers to sue
[01:14:13.920 --> 01:14:19.320]  them, that's in the SPARS 2025-2028 document, and that's why they got indemnified by governments.
[01:14:19.320 --> 01:14:25.120]  I mean, this was a premeditated plan, the good news is, they intended to go a lot longer
[01:14:25.120 --> 01:14:28.120]  and a lot better, they're actually scared right now, in my view.
[01:14:28.120 --> 01:14:31.560]  Yes, they are, well, here's what happened, right?
[01:14:31.560 --> 01:14:37.280]  So strategically, when I started fighting this back in 2020, what I did is I looked at this,
[01:14:37.280 --> 01:14:41.400]  Alex, I saw how big the fight was, and I'm going to be honest, I underestimated it.
[01:14:41.400 --> 01:14:46.400]  I didn't realize how global and how big, but I knew it was way bigger than me, so what
[01:14:46.400 --> 01:14:51.120]  I did was I started a coalition building and hitting cases that were going to really cause
[01:14:51.120 --> 01:14:56.280]  a lot of damage, always in good faith, but some of them were tough, tough cases that
[01:14:56.280 --> 01:14:59.000]  you just didn't know if you could win.
[01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:01.240]  But they were always filed in good faith.
[01:15:01.240 --> 01:15:06.760]  So what happens is, that's created a lot of resistance, and just, I think, honestly,
[01:15:06.760 --> 01:15:10.080]  what you did, Alex, because you've been talking about the truth on this from the beginning,
[01:15:10.080 --> 01:15:14.920]  just like I have, but guys like you and I who are willing to take a lot of arrows for
[01:15:14.920 --> 01:15:18.960]  being called conspiracy theorists and everything else, gave people courage to look into this.
[01:15:18.960 --> 01:15:21.000]  And we also highlighted the information.
[01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:22.600]  I don't think they expected that.
[01:15:22.600 --> 01:15:25.560]  I don't think they expected the kind of fight back that they've got.
[01:15:25.560 --> 01:15:28.680]  Now, they didn't expect suicidal commitment.
[01:15:28.680 --> 01:15:33.920]  No, no, and that's pretty much the insane, we're borderline insane on this, right?
[01:15:33.920 --> 01:15:37.480]  I mean, you know, you fight till the bitter end come hell in our high water because it's
[01:15:37.480 --> 01:15:38.480]  freedom or bust.
[01:15:38.480 --> 01:15:41.080]  Well, yeah, they're hitting our children with a bio weapon.
[01:15:41.080 --> 01:15:45.760]  They'll be right back with Mr. Renz and get into all these big developments and now it
[01:15:45.760 --> 01:15:51.160]  all ties together, the global currency, the war, the control grid, all these hearings,
[01:15:51.160 --> 01:15:52.160]  everything.
[01:15:52.160 --> 01:15:54.880]  We're living in an incredible time, but humanity is fighting back.
[01:15:54.880 --> 01:15:55.880]  Stay with us.
[01:15:55.880 --> 01:16:05.200]  Right now, I'm not talking to the viewers and listeners that have gone to info or store.com

[01:16:33.600 --> 01:16:34.600]  But we need funds to operate.

[01:17:07.600 --> 01:17:08.600]  That's the good news.
[01:17:08.600 --> 01:17:09.600]  They're amazing.
[01:17:09.600 --> 01:17:14.440]  The bad news is around 1% or a little less of our actual viewers and listeners ever

[01:19:06.640 --> 01:19:07.640]  place.
[01:19:07.640 --> 01:19:11.000]  World War III has already started, Biden is a puppet and this is all over our borders
[01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:14.920]  there's mass censorship, James O'Keefe been removed from Project Veritas, the list goes
[01:19:14.920 --> 01:19:18.120]  on and on of the bad things that are happening but the good things that are happening is
[01:19:18.120 --> 01:19:23.160]  humanity is really accelerating it's awakening but those of us on the forefront are under
[01:19:23.160 --> 01:19:27.520]  more attack by the establishment than ever that's why I'm counting on you to spread the

[01:20:00.480 --> 01:20:12.960]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:12.960 --> 01:20:19.120]  Everybody knows that when things are negative and bad I will be the first to tell you but
[01:20:19.120 --> 01:20:22.960]  it's the opposite their entire system is being exposed right now the problem is they're trying
[01:20:22.960 --> 01:20:27.560]  to accelerate world war three as the way to get out of it but I wanted to ask one of the
[01:20:27.560 --> 01:20:32.040]  leading attorneys fighting the globalists on this front Thomas Renz where he thinks this
[01:20:32.040 --> 01:20:36.760]  is all going next in his warnings tying this into all the other big issues but at the same
[01:20:36.760 --> 01:20:42.440]  time the positiveness of the former head of the CDC turning states evidence it should
[01:20:42.440 --> 01:20:45.720]  be the number one story in the country it's got a lot of attention but not one tenth of
[01:20:45.720 --> 01:20:53.200]  what it needs here is Redfield talking about Fauci.
[01:20:53.200 --> 01:20:58.520]  Dr. Fauci knowing that it is a crime to lie to Congress do you wish to retract your statement
[01:20:58.520 --> 01:21:03.200]  of May 11th where you claimed that the NIH never funded gain of function research and
[01:21:03.200 --> 01:21:04.200]  move on.
[01:21:04.200 --> 01:21:11.640]  You are implying that what we did was responsible for the deaths of individual I totally resent
[01:21:11.640 --> 01:21:18.680]  that and if anybody is lying here Senator it is you.
[01:21:18.680 --> 01:21:22.880]  Do you think that Dr. Fauci intentionally lied under oath to Senator Paul when he vehemently
[01:21:22.880 --> 01:21:26.240]  denied NIH's funding of gain of function research.
[01:21:26.240 --> 01:21:29.520]  I think there's no doubt that NIH was funding gain of function research.
[01:21:29.520 --> 01:21:33.160]  Is it likely that American tax dollars funded the gain of function research that created
[01:21:33.160 --> 01:21:34.400]  this virus.
[01:21:34.400 --> 01:21:39.800]  I think it did not only from NIH but from the State Department USAID and from DOD.
[01:21:39.800 --> 01:21:43.800]  So in your expert opinion was the move on institute conducting gain of function research
[01:21:43.800 --> 01:21:44.800]  on viruses.
[01:21:44.800 --> 01:21:45.800]  Absolutely.
[01:21:45.800 --> 01:21:46.800]  Thank you.
[01:21:46.800 --> 01:21:52.840]  Dr. Redfield did you agree in your opinion with Dr. Anderson's assessment at the time
[01:21:52.840 --> 01:21:55.120]  that this virus did look engineered.
[01:21:55.120 --> 01:22:00.640]  It was very disconcerting to me it looked like this virus was engineered.
[01:22:00.640 --> 01:22:04.400]  In one sentence can you provide a definition of gain of function research.
[01:22:04.400 --> 01:22:09.280]  I think it's to take a pathogen and try to increase one of two things or both to increase
[01:22:09.280 --> 01:22:12.520]  its transmissibility or its pathogenicity.
[01:22:12.520 --> 01:22:17.680]  Has gain of function stopped a pandemic in your opinion.
[01:22:17.680 --> 01:22:22.120]  Now in the contrary I think it probably caused the greatest pandemic our world has seen.
[01:22:22.120 --> 01:22:25.720]  And now they're getting ready to blackmail China with it and start a war.
[01:22:25.720 --> 01:22:29.320]  That's what Thomas Renz is here about today Thomas.
[01:22:29.320 --> 01:22:30.400]  Yes sir.
[01:22:30.400 --> 01:22:34.600]  So I mean listen Alex think about what we just heard.
[01:22:34.600 --> 01:22:38.200]  We heard the guy that was running the CDC at the time that this was happened by the way
[01:22:38.200 --> 01:22:44.200]  I'd love to know why he hasn't spoken out till now but I'll take it right.
[01:22:44.200 --> 01:22:47.200]  Someone's finally telling the truth and boy did you hit the nail on the head when you
[01:22:47.200 --> 01:22:52.080]  said these guys are finally they're losing they're in trouble they're in big trouble.
[01:22:52.080 --> 01:22:55.800]  Yeah by the way I'll tell you why he's coming out now.
[01:22:55.800 --> 01:23:00.080]  When we filed the case with Huff up in New York they know that that case against Eco
[01:23:00.080 --> 01:23:03.640]  Health Alliance all this stuff's coming out so what you got now is a lot of rats scurrying
[01:23:03.640 --> 01:23:07.480]  for the hills because I don't know tell them who Huff is briefly.
[01:23:07.480 --> 01:23:11.520]  Okay so Dr. Andrew Huff is a he's a veteran.
[01:23:11.520 --> 01:23:17.240]  He worked for and he worked for Sandia Labs at Q clearance.
[01:23:17.240 --> 01:23:23.160]  He worked for Eco Health Alliance one of the most qualified people on the planet.
[01:23:23.160 --> 01:23:27.880]  He was there he worked for Eco Health Alliance in an executive capacity when they created
[01:23:27.880 --> 01:23:29.680]  this in the Wuhan lab.
[01:23:29.680 --> 01:23:35.680]  He was the vice president he was the vice president yeah yeah yeah he's a client of
[01:23:35.680 --> 01:23:42.920]  mine and his testified under penalty of perjury that that they created this in the lab while
[01:23:42.920 --> 01:23:44.320]  he was working there.
[01:23:44.320 --> 01:23:51.160]  So we have a first-hand witness we have tons of tech cooperating testimony I mean we put
[01:23:51.160 --> 01:23:52.480]  this out before the election.
[01:23:52.480 --> 01:23:57.480]  I must say you were on two years ago and you said I have the biggest whistleblower inside
[01:23:57.480 --> 01:24:01.720]  and you weren't you weren't lying and you brought forward so many others but continue.
[01:24:01.720 --> 01:24:07.080]  Yeah so now this all come down so they have to admit the truth and so now what you're
[01:24:07.080 --> 01:24:11.640]  seeing is a lot of game you know gamesmanship who do we shift the blame on how do we do
[01:24:11.640 --> 01:24:12.640]  this.
[01:24:12.640 --> 01:24:17.040]  Well the Department of the Defense and Intel agencies are the two most important players
[01:24:17.040 --> 01:24:18.040]  in this.
[01:24:18.040 --> 01:24:21.800]  They were involved with COVID they were involved with the vaccines they create they not only
[01:24:21.800 --> 01:24:26.760]  funded the creation but you got to understand when you get a COVID vaccine you're not getting
[01:24:26.760 --> 01:24:30.000]  it from Pfizer you're getting it from our Defense Department.
[01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:34.920]  They sign contracts with Pfizer and Moderna that say that we will distribute these and
[01:24:34.920 --> 01:24:38.680]  we will only distribute them where you have prep act immunity.
[01:24:38.680 --> 01:24:42.560]  Our Department of Defense did this and that's because they had a hand in creating the jabs
[01:24:42.560 --> 01:24:44.840]  as well as the virus.
[01:24:44.840 --> 01:24:51.520]  We know all this we have all this then fast forward to just the last couple days.
[01:24:51.520 --> 01:24:56.760]  So Senator Josh Holly who I appreciate him and I don't think he's aware of this because
[01:24:56.760 --> 01:25:00.840]  when a congressman or senator asked for a bill they send it off to legislative services
[01:25:00.840 --> 01:25:05.760]  legislative services writes it and then you get whatever back you get and what we found
[01:25:05.760 --> 01:25:10.240]  is we found a substantial amount of evidence that legislative services and a lot of these
[01:25:10.240 --> 01:25:16.160]  congressmen have in their offices people who sold out we have evidence of this right.
[01:25:16.160 --> 01:25:20.760]  So you look at this bill and I've got it right here I'm looking off to the side so I can
[01:25:20.760 --> 01:25:23.360]  share this with you.
[01:25:23.360 --> 01:25:29.800]  This bill specifically says declassify any and all information related to potential links
[01:25:29.800 --> 01:25:35.280]  between Wuhan Institute of Virology and the origin of coronavirus.
[01:25:35.280 --> 01:25:41.400]  It goes on and it lays out in several different places that they want to get to the origins
[01:25:41.400 --> 01:25:44.360]  but they really only care about Wuhan.
[01:25:44.360 --> 01:25:51.520]  Well have you had in the history of of congress you don't start and you don't start an investigation
[01:25:51.520 --> 01:25:54.120]  that's a law and say we only look here.
[01:25:54.120 --> 01:25:58.440]  Yeah that's exactly what they're doing well and think about our current congress Alex
[01:25:58.440 --> 01:26:05.640]  what they put with unanimous consent unanimous that doesn't happen right now I mean this
[01:26:05.640 --> 01:26:11.080]  is pushed by the DOD is why this is happening the DOD is going to use this right now what
[01:26:11.080 --> 01:26:17.160]  we've got is China's rattling their sabers about Taiwan and Ukraine and we don't want
[01:26:17.160 --> 01:26:22.560]  them in Taiwan and we definitely don't want them back in Russia and Ukraine.
[01:26:22.560 --> 01:26:26.720]  So what we're doing now is we're saying hey look at this little legislation we got that's
[01:26:26.720 --> 01:26:30.600]  going to show the whole world how you guys created this in the lab.
[01:26:30.600 --> 01:26:33.040]  So they're going to frame China and we'll just back you up what you said three minutes
[01:26:33.040 --> 01:26:37.840]  ago pull up Reuters from two years ago the UN said don't give it to the migrants we're
[01:26:37.840 --> 01:26:42.080]  bringing in because we don't have liability protection to them only give it to your citizens
[01:26:42.080 --> 01:26:44.120]  because we're going to kill them.
[01:26:44.120 --> 01:26:47.720]  This is all pre-planned this is all wargamed.
[01:26:47.720 --> 01:26:52.520]  Yeah absolutely and that's right because under the foreign tort claims act there may actually
[01:26:52.520 --> 01:26:56.800]  be you know some different mechanisms by which they could get to this we identified that
[01:26:56.800 --> 01:26:58.880]  as a potential workaround.
[01:26:58.880 --> 01:27:02.160]  See so they weren't forced in some of these illegal immigrants together they were they
[01:27:02.160 --> 01:27:04.640]  were really it was really an unbelievable thing.
[01:27:04.640 --> 01:27:08.800]  Meanwhile if you remember Alex at the same time we got videos where they would go in
[01:27:08.800 --> 01:27:13.200]  into homes where there were people with special needs and drag them out screaming as they
[01:27:13.200 --> 01:27:18.680]  were forcing these jabs on them they probably killed many of them yeah yeah.
[01:27:18.680 --> 01:27:23.120]  So this was entirely planned and to think that this bill like I said I don't want to
[01:27:23.120 --> 01:27:29.920]  say that Senator Holly did this for anything but good reasons but remember our DOD has
[01:27:29.920 --> 01:27:32.800]  its fingers into everything everything.
[01:27:32.800 --> 01:27:39.200]  We all thought by the way Fauci in his position was tied in with the DOD their part of their
[01:27:39.200 --> 01:27:44.480]  job was looking at biodefense so the DOD had their thumb on Fauci the whole time with this.
[01:27:44.480 --> 01:27:49.960]  Fauci's a crook for sure and belongs under Gitmo but the problem is that this was really
[01:27:49.960 --> 01:27:55.920]  out of our intelligence agencies in DOD which they knew they had to do it that way because
[01:27:55.920 --> 01:28:01.720]  the DOD and the intel agencies have immunity to FOIAs they've got immunity to lawsuits
[01:28:01.720 --> 01:28:05.640]  all they do is say it's national security you can't bother us and that's it.
[01:28:05.640 --> 01:28:10.520]  So the reason that all of this happened was because there's no accountability to our Department
[01:28:10.520 --> 01:28:13.520]  of Defense and Obama knew that.
[01:28:13.520 --> 01:28:14.520]  So when Obama.
[01:28:14.520 --> 01:28:19.200]  And so they're injecting our troops with an experimental poison shot while the illegal
[01:28:19.200 --> 01:28:23.000]  aliens don't have to take it when we come back I want to ask you then we know it goes
[01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:27.000]  all the way to the top and above that's the big foundations that created the policy what
[01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:31.040]  was their end game how is their operation going how do we stop them and how does it tie
[01:28:31.040 --> 01:28:35.520]  into Russia and the rest of it and yes I hate the Communist Chinese but they're being framed
[01:28:35.520 --> 01:28:41.040]  right now folks for World War 3 this is so dangerous this is all documented we'll be
[01:28:41.040 --> 01:28:44.120]  right back with Attorney Thomas Renz and more straight ahead tell everybody you know

[01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:10.480]  out with drug addicts and criminals and now you've gone to ground zero of a massive chemical
[01:32:10.480 --> 01:32:15.760]  spill are you addicted to the danger savannah have you ever considered that for a second now I'm addicted
[01:32:15.760 --> 01:32:20.320]  to helping my fellow Americans I'm addicted to spreading the truth and again I you know I have
[01:32:20.320 --> 01:32:25.040]  info words to thank for that looking back on the day I was able to ask President Donald Trump two
[01:32:25.040 --> 01:32:30.720]  questions I was so grateful because you know I truly was classically trained under Alex Jones and
[01:32:30.720 --> 01:32:36.560]  under the info wars team I really do credit that as to why I'm able to you know get these types of
[01:32:36.560 --> 01:32:42.000]  clips because Alex's whole mentality was you know go where the story is go where the mainstream
[01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:47.520]  media refuses to so it's not that I'm addicted to the insanity I'm just addicted to telling the truth
[01:32:47.520 --> 01:32:52.160]  and helping the American people and I really do credit Alex for you know really instilling that
[01:32:52.160 --> 01:33:04.240]  within me early on in my career leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's
[01:33:04.240 --> 01:33:16.720]  Alex Jones all right Thomas rims our guest here on the Alex Jones show super smart guy
[01:33:20.160 --> 01:33:28.960]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want to stop tyranny well so does he live
[01:33:28.960 --> 01:33:35.680]  from the info wars.com studios it's Alex Jones so when I've been jumping in with him we didn't
[01:33:35.680 --> 01:33:39.360]  talk before he came on I'm gonna just back up everything he's saying so you know it's real but
[01:33:39.360 --> 01:33:43.920]  I wanted to start over big picture where we are where this is going tying into world war three
[01:33:43.920 --> 01:33:48.320]  how we stop it I'm gonna try to shut up now for the next 25 minutes until this hour ends you've
[01:33:48.320 --> 01:33:56.880]  got the floor well you know where we are Alex is we're in a position where we fought back so hard
[01:33:56.880 --> 01:34:01.440]  that we actually have an opportunity to win this now you got to understand when you come into this
[01:34:02.160 --> 01:34:06.000]  you look at a whole bunch of enemies of American I started to say before the break
[01:34:06.560 --> 01:34:12.080]  before Obama left the White House the insurance policy you know we've talked a lot on I know
[01:34:12.080 --> 01:34:16.160]  you've talked a lot about and we've talked a lot elsewhere about the fact that you know
[01:34:16.160 --> 01:34:20.560]  Obama had his insurance policy against the Trump administration everybody looked at that as being the
[01:34:20.560 --> 01:34:26.240]  FBI or the Russia collusion it was much bigger than that much bigger these guys didn't leave
[01:34:26.240 --> 01:34:31.360]  much to waste what they did is they fired the entirety of our brass in the Pentagon and in the
[01:34:31.360 --> 01:34:38.160]  intelligence agencies where there was FBI, DIA, CIA, Pentagon all the brass now our soldiers are
[01:34:38.160 --> 01:34:43.040]  still the same heroes they've always been but the brass got terminated and Obama replaced them with
[01:34:43.040 --> 01:34:48.960]  a bunch of crooks and and losers so that was insurance policy that was the insurance policy
[01:34:48.960 --> 01:34:54.480]  against Trump and those are the people who've been putting in these awful awful situations
[01:34:54.480 --> 01:35:00.160]  in the last few years so if you look the DOD was responsible and tied in with COVID they funded
[01:35:00.160 --> 01:35:04.960]  the development and listen I said this before I'll say it again are you going to tell me
[01:35:05.760 --> 01:35:11.600]  that we have coronavirus which is designated under federal regulation is an abnormally dangerous
[01:35:11.600 --> 01:35:18.320]  material right if you're working on a coronavirus it's it's by regulation dangerous you're going
[01:35:18.320 --> 01:35:25.200]  to tell me that we took the genetic technology that we needed to do work on this inherently
[01:35:25.200 --> 01:35:32.400]  dangerous material transferred it to Wuhan China a known Chinese CCP bio weapons development center
[01:35:33.200 --> 01:35:39.440]  to do work on this without our military's knowledge that's nonsense of course they knew this of course
[01:35:39.440 --> 01:35:46.320]  they knew this you fast forward what happens in 2020 so in 2020 we've got COVID hits COVID allows a
[01:35:46.320 --> 01:35:51.760]  lot of things to happen it wasn't just one thing now we get really focused we look at the election
[01:35:51.760 --> 01:35:56.800]  steal yes the election steal couldn't happen without COVID the mail-in ballots all this shifting
[01:35:56.800 --> 01:36:03.920]  they couldn't do it they couldn't steal enough votes without the the COVID cover to truly look
[01:36:03.920 --> 01:36:08.640]  credible in this I don't think they looked all that credible anyways but that's decided the other
[01:36:08.640 --> 01:36:13.840]  thing that was happening though is the censorship right with COVID gave them an excuse to say we
[01:36:13.840 --> 01:36:20.240]  have to censor because vaccine misinformation could create vaccine hesitancy and that's a disaster
[01:36:20.240 --> 01:36:25.600]  well that what that has translated into since we saw from the Twitter files yesterday is
[01:36:25.600 --> 01:36:32.080]  that what's occurred is they're actually they're even censoring the truth they the Twitter files
[01:36:32.080 --> 01:36:37.760]  showed openly these guys were legitimately censoring the truth they didn't want true side
[01:36:37.760 --> 01:36:41.600]  effects and true things have because they said well it could create vaccine hesitancy well don't
[01:36:41.600 --> 01:36:48.880]  you want that I would think you'd want that but you don't so you meanwhile while all this is
[01:36:48.880 --> 01:36:54.560]  happening one of the other major things that happens with COVID is the all the small and
[01:36:54.560 --> 01:37:02.720]  mid-sized business that makes America function was dying they were absolutely dying so we lost
[01:37:02.720 --> 01:37:07.760]  big business the globalists who are largely behind this made all sorts of money if you look at the
[01:37:07.760 --> 01:37:13.760]  2021 World Economic Forum they they actually said COVID is the most profitable event in human history
[01:37:14.400 --> 01:37:20.800]  well it wasn't for me it may have been for them but that's because when when your local hardware
[01:37:20.800 --> 01:37:27.280]  store goes out of business you buy from Amazon so you've got the this economic situation shift
[01:37:27.280 --> 01:37:33.520]  where it's one of the greatest wealth transfers up to the billionaires in history so as that's
[01:37:33.520 --> 01:37:38.560]  happening you're also seeing a situation where the stability of the US dollar and everything
[01:37:38.560 --> 01:37:43.520]  else is under attack both because Biden's not allowing us to mine our own natural resources
[01:37:44.400 --> 01:37:50.960]  but also because without small to mid-sized business that's that's the core to the American
[01:37:50.960 --> 01:37:58.320]  economy it's always bad so as that's failing we become very reliant on just a few big businesses
[01:37:58.320 --> 01:38:02.560]  well it's easy to manipulate big business especially if you're black rocker vanguard
[01:38:02.560 --> 01:38:07.280]  who just happened to be partners in the world economic forum and everyone else so you know
[01:38:07.280 --> 01:38:12.880]  you can you can make an economic crisis as you wish and then you can just prop up the same people
[01:38:12.880 --> 01:38:18.400]  you tore right back down it's all smoke and mirrors that you're able to do when you control the money
[01:38:18.400 --> 01:38:26.160]  well that leads to CBDCs right meanwhile you also have the most important experiment to the
[01:38:26.160 --> 01:38:32.400]  globalists in the world going on Ukraine right Ukraine is where they're testing a lot of this
[01:38:32.400 --> 01:38:38.000]  stuff for the new world order now you can say that all this stuff is gobbledygook but I can
[01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:43.600]  actually bring you documents on everything that I've said so far I can show you paperwork or
[01:38:43.600 --> 01:38:51.600]  video clips of the world economic forum participants talking about this so now you got CBDCs and you've
[01:38:51.600 --> 01:38:57.520]  got to push for vaccines and it pushed for this and it pushed for that you've got a you've got the
[01:38:57.520 --> 01:39:03.200]  the ground laid for what could be a world war now one of the things and this is there's some
[01:39:03.200 --> 01:39:08.240]  speculation here I don't have paper on this I'm of the belief that there's a power struggle between
[01:39:08.240 --> 01:39:13.680]  the world economic forum and the CCP they both hate America and because America has been weakened
[01:39:13.680 --> 01:39:19.200]  by bad policies COVID globalist conspiracies all these different things now I think you have a
[01:39:19.200 --> 01:39:24.720]  situation where these guys they want to kill America they want to kill freedom but they also
[01:39:24.720 --> 01:39:31.840]  want to balance that with how do I preserve me right world economic forum wants to run the show
[01:39:31.840 --> 01:39:35.840]  CCP wants to run the show Russia doesn't really want either of them to run the show
[01:39:36.480 --> 01:39:41.200]  Russia doesn't have a great path forward where they run the show but they'd prefer that and then
[01:39:41.200 --> 01:39:45.040]  let's not forget some of the Islamic terrorist countries that really are out there as well
[01:39:45.040 --> 01:39:51.040]  that don't like America all of these things are combining together to create a situation where
[01:39:51.040 --> 01:39:57.040]  America is under attack from every direction we're holding our ground on a bunch of these
[01:39:57.760 --> 01:40:04.320]  but we have this huge disaster now that the real key is if the American people
[01:40:05.920 --> 01:40:10.160]  are willing to stand together and stand for freedom through all the tumult that's going to
[01:40:10.160 --> 01:40:14.240]  be coming in the next five years and it's going to be ugly folks and if you think this is going
[01:40:14.240 --> 01:40:20.000]  to be over quickly I got news for you but if we're willing to stand together and stand strong as we
[01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:26.800]  have so far if we're willing to support our warriors like alex like info wars if we're willing to
[01:40:26.800 --> 01:40:31.920]  come together and to demand freedom and keep pushing what we're pushing I think we can win this
[01:40:32.480 --> 01:40:38.240]  we have also been developing on our side I mean you know this alex guys like me who would have
[01:40:38.240 --> 01:40:41.920]  ever thought that you'd know a guy like me but a lot of us have came out of the woodwork so the
[01:40:41.920 --> 01:40:46.080]  warriors are now standing up and we're starting to coordinate we're actually starting to get
[01:40:46.080 --> 01:40:52.000]  God's army together to fight for freedom so and that's the key is interrupt we now the new world
[01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:56.400]  orders out in the open we know it's predatory you have the globalist and the chai comms all
[01:40:57.760 --> 01:41:01.200]  feeding and sucking off America but they're kind of fighting over who's going to be in charge of
[01:41:01.200 --> 01:41:08.480]  that right now and and please continue you're well you're dead on and but because because
[01:41:09.600 --> 01:41:13.840]  you know what happened was all of us started fighting our own issues early on we started
[01:41:13.840 --> 01:41:18.400]  filing you know we had heroes fighting on election issues heroes fighting on censorship heroes
[01:41:18.400 --> 01:41:24.480]  fighting on COVID heroes fighting on all these different things right well we found each other
[01:41:24.480 --> 01:41:29.040]  and even though we still bicker with each other and but heads a lot we're still on the same side
[01:41:29.040 --> 01:41:34.400]  and we found each other and we've got we'll continue to develop and coordinate together and
[01:41:34.400 --> 01:41:40.000]  and that's that's really the key so there's hope and I'm going to give you something I'd like to
[01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:47.440]  give the info wars audience some very specific hope right so I'm working and we've been working
[01:41:47.440 --> 01:41:52.800]  and general Flynn will often say local action national impact and there's an example here
[01:41:53.440 --> 01:42:00.160]  so I'm working in Missouri Missouri is a very red state we have a bill in Missouri house bill 1169
[01:42:01.280 --> 01:42:07.040]  it does three things Alex three things it makes it so that you have to have informed consent and
[01:42:07.040 --> 01:42:12.480]  informed consent has to include adverse events of special interest so they can't just say we're
[01:42:12.480 --> 01:42:16.800]  only going to include certain things and then form consent it means anything benefit or negative
[01:42:16.800 --> 01:42:22.560]  or risk you have to be of informed consent so it requires informed consent it requires that any
[01:42:22.560 --> 01:42:28.000]  gene altering technology be labeled gene altering technology whether it's in a vaccine or something
[01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:34.800]  else or not and it requires that if that technology if anything that you get could alter your genetics
[01:42:34.800 --> 01:42:40.800]  that they share whether it's transmissible so three disclosures all three things that they say they
[01:42:40.800 --> 01:42:44.960]  don't they they're either doing or don't care about anyways because it never mattered
[01:42:47.040 --> 01:42:52.640]  that bill was introduced and they were told to kill the bill by Pfizer's lobbyists hold on stay there
[01:42:52.640 --> 01:42:56.320]  let's come back we're talking about direct action to counter these lies we'll be right back with

[01:47:59.200 --> 01:48:02.400]  thomas rinds our guest he was getting us a really key point to the break cut him off
[01:48:03.440 --> 01:48:06.880]  great lawyer at the very tip of the spear in this fight as the house of cards comes down please
[01:48:06.880 --> 01:48:14.000]  continue yes so i saw about house bill 1169 in missouri so all it does is disclosure right you
[01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:18.240]  get to find out about your side effects you get to find out if something's a jay going to affect
[01:48:18.240 --> 01:48:24.720]  your genes that's it so we wrote that bill specifically so that there was no reason to oppose
[01:48:24.720 --> 01:48:30.480]  it because do you really think in red missouri that your constituents don't want to know if
[01:48:30.480 --> 01:48:34.240]  their genes are going to be played with of course they want to know that now that was
[01:48:34.240 --> 01:48:39.440]  opposed by dean plocker initially and now they're trying to slow walk it through the republican
[01:48:39.440 --> 01:48:44.480]  house and the republican senate because they don't want it passed we had outright we were outright
[01:48:44.480 --> 01:48:49.760]  told by the feiser lobbyists and other lobbyists that they are going to kill this bill so they're
[01:48:49.760 --> 01:48:57.200]  walking is slow walking it through plockers lying to other house reps about what the bill is and
[01:48:57.200 --> 01:49:02.800]  nobody will bother to read the two page bill it's two pages no writers know anything let house bill
[01:49:02.800 --> 01:49:10.960]  1169 missouri so this is where it goes to local action now if people hear about this in missouri
[01:49:10.960 --> 01:49:17.280]  and people call their house reps and their state reps in missouri they're gonna this that's that
[01:49:17.280 --> 01:49:22.960]  this bill can pass we can actually do it and if it passes we get honest information about side
[01:49:22.960 --> 01:49:29.440]  effects and transmissibility globally because what's true in missouri is true everywhere but
[01:49:30.240 --> 01:49:35.840]  but but but we got word that they've now called in the international lobbyists the international
[01:49:35.840 --> 01:49:41.440]  big boys to try and fight this because it's hard to do so we call them because they know once
[01:49:41.440 --> 01:49:47.200]  missouri goes that way like dominoes and it's missouri that's subpoenaing fowl to you and all
[01:49:47.200 --> 01:49:54.080]  the rest of it yes absolutely so a little bit of truth goes a long way but what how do you
[01:49:54.080 --> 01:49:58.640]  oppose this politically what we're against you knowing if your genes are going to be modified
[01:49:58.640 --> 01:50:02.400]  of course they can't oppose that so what they're doing is they're trying to slow walk it through
[01:50:02.400 --> 01:50:05.920]  committees and slow walk it through this and slow walk it through that so that they can't
[01:50:06.880 --> 01:50:11.520]  they don't have to deal with the political accountability but what we're doing is so for
[01:50:11.520 --> 01:50:17.440]  example there was a guy a house rep that was talking about this bill and he was just wrong
[01:50:17.440 --> 01:50:22.320]  about he's telling his local republican party about it and he was wrong now i've been told he's
[01:50:22.320 --> 01:50:28.080]  a good guy i don't know if he's a good guy then he's probably lied to by the house leadership
[01:50:28.080 --> 01:50:35.200]  who that sells out but because we call them out that's going to change the nature so you can do
[01:50:35.200 --> 01:50:40.240]  this locally right this is the reason i'm telling this story it's very missouri specific but it'll
[01:50:40.240 --> 01:50:45.840]  change the world if we pass the bill this is something you can do locally you can locally
[01:50:45.840 --> 01:50:50.560]  tell your republican party this is what this bill says it's two pages don't listen to this liar
[01:50:51.120 --> 01:50:56.240]  because the republican party is no different than the democrat party at the top most of them are
[01:50:56.240 --> 01:51:00.240]  uniparty this is why i don't this is why i get so censored alex you know about the censorship better
[01:51:00.240 --> 01:51:05.360]  than me but you know because you don't sell out to the republicans or the democrats you know the
[01:51:05.360 --> 01:51:11.360]  uniparty exists and you call them out both sides dislike you well i'm doing the same thing here
[01:51:11.360 --> 01:51:16.320]  this is the uniparty now there's some good republican people in missouri and the people of
[01:51:16.320 --> 01:51:20.720]  missouri are great we pass this by the way everybody's to get your bill and get introduced in their
[01:51:20.720 --> 01:51:27.040]  legislature it should be in every state and ask your legislature ask your republicans especially
[01:51:27.040 --> 01:51:32.000]  or democrats how is it that you oppose me knowing if i'm getting something that's going to screw with
[01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:37.440]  my genes is that what they'll say well it doesn't well then you should have no problem passing the
[01:51:37.440 --> 01:51:42.880]  bill right there's zero reason to oppose this bill by the way though they now officially admit it does
[01:51:42.880 --> 01:51:49.600]  change your genes yes they do yes they do we know that it does it alters your dna permanently uh we've
[01:51:49.600 --> 01:51:54.000]  got a ton of stuff on that but you know this is the kind of thing because one of the things that
[01:51:54.000 --> 01:51:57.920]  you talked about hope alex you talked about hope and you talked about us when and i want to give
[01:51:57.920 --> 01:52:04.800]  that to our the listeners right now because at the end of the day we can do something you don't
[01:52:04.800 --> 01:52:10.800]  have to be an attorney you don't have to be a huge broadcaster like alex jones but if you don't do
[01:52:10.800 --> 01:52:15.680]  anything if you just sit around telling yourself i'm helpless you're right then you're helpless
[01:52:15.680 --> 01:52:20.880]  if you do something if you go to your local republican party if you go to your local events if you
[01:52:20.880 --> 01:52:26.720]  call your house rep house rep is not a big position you can call a state house rep and say hey
[01:52:27.360 --> 01:52:32.560]  what's going on how much trouble do you know that 20 to 30 calls on a single issue for a state house
[01:52:32.560 --> 01:52:38.800]  rep has do you know it's a huge impact that never happens we've had we've talked some of these guys
[01:52:38.800 --> 01:52:46.160]  down and if we can pass this in one state we only need one state and it changes everything i've got
[01:52:46.160 --> 01:52:51.600]  causes of action i can sue over this i can understand so you put teeth in it so that's 100 foot view
[01:52:51.600 --> 01:52:57.200]  what about the 35 000 foot view how do we stop them framing china for the virus so that bill
[01:52:57.200 --> 01:53:01.920]  gates and claus schwaub and the whole new world order gets away with it it can do it again how
[01:53:01.920 --> 01:53:07.280]  do we expose that legislation in congress yeah and so that's the other thing and that's the part
[01:53:07.280 --> 01:53:11.200]  that everybody wants to you know everybody thinks that they've got to do that and they can you know
[01:53:11.200 --> 01:53:16.560]  you're right if you live in in freeman ohio and you're nobody like me you probably can't stop that
[01:53:16.560 --> 01:53:23.120]  by yourself but but but but you know i can come and i can talk to you alex and you've got a huge
[01:53:23.120 --> 01:53:30.480]  audience and i can get the word out and the thing is is collectively what i think we're seeing on
[01:53:30.480 --> 01:53:37.120]  platforms like twitter which only shadow bands less than they used to uh and some of these other
[01:53:37.120 --> 01:53:41.200]  private with the information getting out to social getter all these different platforms
[01:53:42.080 --> 01:53:45.840]  there's enough information getting out that i think that it's pretty well known that the
[01:53:45.840 --> 01:53:51.920]  support for a world war is pretty low uh you know everybody wants to say i'm for ukraine until
[01:53:51.920 --> 01:53:56.560]  you say well you want your kid to go die over there uh and the answer to that is pretty much
[01:53:56.560 --> 01:54:02.400]  universally no so i think that the key here is to continue the political pressure i think that what
[01:54:02.400 --> 01:54:06.640]  we see is a confluence of things happening that are creating enough political pressure where we
[01:54:06.640 --> 01:54:12.960]  can have some national impact uh you know i mean i'm looking at some lawsuits uh to do this we're
[01:54:12.960 --> 01:54:18.320]  working on the next series of really big lawsuits and i'm hoping that they're going to break through
[01:54:18.320 --> 01:54:22.560]  some of the censorship and allow people to get you know a greater picture of what's going on
[01:54:24.240 --> 01:54:29.440]  that's going to be a big thing i think that really just continuing to support your your
[01:54:29.440 --> 01:54:33.280]  matt gates of this world who are out there you know they're willing to take some bullets to
[01:54:33.280 --> 01:54:39.120]  stand on on principle uh we got to get you know trump i'm hopeful trump's gonna finally see the
[01:54:39.120 --> 01:54:46.160]  light on the vaccines i actually i'm praying to god uh that the truth is is getting to him and uh
[01:54:46.160 --> 01:54:51.600]  because if he comes out on that then there's no more reason for any conservative not to coalesce
[01:54:51.600 --> 01:54:56.560]  behind him and to you know let him do what he does which is to lead lead that mega movement
[01:54:56.560 --> 01:55:00.800]  and fighting for america i totally agree and the average person they think oh it's just a poison
[01:55:00.800 --> 01:55:05.920]  shot it's one issue no it's the world id it's control of our bodies it's it's it's it's the
[01:55:05.920 --> 01:55:12.240]  vaccine passport it's the whole thing we've got to be very thankful to all the work everybody's done
[01:55:12.240 --> 01:55:16.960]  that these hearings are devastating the the learning curve in congress is just it's going
[01:55:16.960 --> 01:55:23.840]  parabolic uh and so i'm really concerned about the deep state releasing a new virus a marburg
[01:55:23.840 --> 01:55:30.640]  a monkey pox they've been pre-programming the media for that that's my concern we're here in 2025
[01:55:30.640 --> 01:55:38.000]  alex um so this is projection right so you can't prove something's gonna happen the timeline i got
[01:55:38.880 --> 01:55:44.480]  that i think is most likely to be accurate and i want to stress to everybody i'm you know i can
[01:55:44.480 --> 01:55:50.480]  never prove the future the timeline that i got that's most accurate is that 2025 is the gold
[01:55:50.480 --> 01:55:55.600]  date for the next pandemic the reason for that is is the who treaty finalizes in may of 2024
[01:55:55.600 --> 01:56:01.520]  and uh they got to have the right president in place so the next big step is stealing the next
[01:56:01.520 --> 01:56:08.160]  election and the actually more important than that what we're getting from from our sources
[01:56:08.160 --> 01:56:13.440]  is that the biggest thing common now is they're going to quintuple down on censorship they're
[01:56:13.440 --> 01:56:17.520]  going to really partner they're going to be pushing google really hard and some of the other things
[01:56:17.520 --> 01:56:22.640]  really hard they got to get that censorship handled because what's happened is is this
[01:56:22.640 --> 01:56:29.200]  network info wars uh and actually by the way i forgot to tell you alex off air i'll give you
[01:56:29.200 --> 01:56:34.400]  some insight uh you were mentioned in some whistleblower data that i recently got they are scared of
[01:56:34.400 --> 01:56:41.760]  you uh they are they're terrified of this network um this network the others who are getting the word
[01:56:41.760 --> 01:56:48.480]  out critical critical because they're going to try and triple down on censoring us they're going to
[01:56:48.480 --> 01:56:52.800]  try and triple down on keeping the word down because that's the only way that they can credibly
[01:56:52.800 --> 01:56:58.880]  steal the next election if they if the if there's anything short of complete censorship the 2024
[01:56:58.880 --> 01:57:02.880]  election there's no way they're going to be able to steal we're out of time but uh all fair let me
[01:57:02.880 --> 01:57:06.240]  ask you what the whistleblower information is that's interesting but they're just scared of the

[02:00:07.760 --> 02:00:14.240]  well it's the same the mayor can't be here for this but good afternoon austin city council
[02:00:14.240 --> 02:00:19.680]  i want to address some confusion there seems to be from this city council our local government
[02:00:19.680 --> 02:00:27.520]  which has led to a grave injustice which is the firing of spencer cronk the city manager now
[02:00:28.320 --> 02:00:32.800]  we all remember what happened really the last three winners when there were severe winter
[02:00:32.800 --> 02:00:40.320]  storms and ice and power outages recently people were without power for three days some people as
[02:00:40.320 --> 02:00:48.400]  long as a week and we were looking for somebody to blame and this city council blamed spencer
[02:00:48.400 --> 02:00:58.880]  cronk but i'm a little confused why spencer cronk was fired instead of celebrated because i
[02:00:58.880 --> 02:01:04.720]  thought as you addressed the last time you met on the seventh i thought stopping climate change
[02:01:05.280 --> 02:01:10.560]  was something this city council took seriously now the last i checked and i've got the numbers
[02:01:10.560 --> 02:01:17.520]  right in front of me from urcott the two leading sources of energy in texas are natural gas and
[02:01:17.520 --> 02:01:24.880]  coal and it's actually not even close without natural gas and coal there will be no power for
[02:01:24.880 --> 02:01:32.800]  anybody and that brings me to the ultimate point this city council is comprised of democrats
[02:01:32.800 --> 02:01:39.760]  including the mayor we have one republican on this city council now your leader joe biden
[02:01:39.760 --> 02:01:47.760]  biden has made it very clear he's targeting coal and natural gas more than 20 state sue biden for
[02:01:47.760 --> 02:01:53.440]  canceling keystone xl pipeline biden did that as soon as he got into office they're now stopping new
[02:01:53.440 --> 02:02:01.120]  oil projects like the willow project in alaska biden vows to shut down coal plants all across
[02:02:01.120 --> 02:02:10.880]  america so you understand gas and coal the two leading energy sources in texas in austin and the
[02:02:10.880 --> 02:02:18.400]  democrats want to shut them down a quarter of us coal fire power plants will retire by the end of
[02:02:18.400 --> 02:02:26.320]  2029 now if the mayor was here i would remind him he just met with joe biden who is the one calling
[02:02:26.320 --> 02:02:33.920]  for these energies to be shut down so what will it look like for the city of austin texas if we
[02:02:33.920 --> 02:02:39.760]  shut down coal and natural gas well i'll tell you what it will look like it will look like exactly
[02:02:39.760 --> 02:02:45.200]  how it looked like during the winter storm for the last three years how's that man made global
[02:02:45.200 --> 02:02:51.600]  warming going we now have ice storms every year here in austin so i don't understand why spencer
[02:02:51.600 --> 02:02:57.680]  crank was fired if anything he should be celebrated think about what those three four five days without
[02:02:57.680 --> 02:03:03.920]  power saved us the days for the future generations of americans that we have preserved for shutting
[02:03:03.920 --> 02:03:09.840]  off the power three days without power let's try three weeks how about three months maybe three
[02:03:09.840 --> 02:03:16.960]  years how about three generations how committed is this city council really to fighting man made
[02:03:16.960 --> 02:03:21.920]  climate change and have we really weighed the costs thank you speaker have we really weighed
[02:03:21.920 --> 02:03:30.640]  the cost spencer cronk should be next we turn to his own welden thank you clerk clerk can you call
[02:03:30.640 --> 02:03:44.000]  our next speaker thank you guys it appears that mayor kurt watson has taken a page out of mayor
[02:03:44.000 --> 02:03:51.040]  adler's book and he leaves the chambers when oan shroyer is set to speak he just leaves the chambers
[02:03:51.040 --> 02:03:56.960]  he just scurries away i haven't even met mayor watson yet i was looking forward to meeting him
[02:03:56.960 --> 02:04:01.760]  today i had a good relationship with steve adler and for him to run away like that like a coward
[02:04:02.400 --> 02:04:07.840]  kirk your first impression with me is that you're a coward and i'm sorry to see that i think this
[02:04:07.840 --> 02:04:11.840]  is a serious issue after all kirk watson went to the white house to talk about climate change
[02:04:11.840 --> 02:04:16.480]  the last time this city council met i've got the agenda right here in front of me it was about
[02:04:16.480 --> 02:04:22.080]  climate change so they want to shut off our power so why are they complaining when we're
[02:04:22.080 --> 02:04:26.400]  without power for three days when they want to shut it off permanently there's no sources
[02:04:26.400 --> 02:04:29.520]  for alternative energy i'll show you the numbers i have them right in front of me
[02:04:31.680 --> 02:04:37.920]  and so it's amazing how they don't even really seem to understand the cost of their own policies
[02:04:37.920 --> 02:04:45.520]  here here's here's texas energy sources natural gas and coal see that this is the vast majority
[02:04:45.520 --> 02:04:51.040]  of our energy here in texas democrats have made it clear they want to shut down cool
[02:04:51.040 --> 02:04:56.000]  uh see the floor of important info wars dot com it's excellent oan shroyer calls out the
[02:04:56.000 --> 02:05:04.000]  democrat climate hypocrisy cult right now i'm not talking to the viewers and listeners that have

[02:07:05.200 --> 02:07:12.480]  club spacetime january 6 continuum presenting unseen video footage revealing that the complete
[02:07:12.480 --> 02:07:19.840]  story had not only not been told but it had also been doctored by the january 6 committee to satiate
[02:07:19.840 --> 02:07:25.760]  the trump derangement syndrome mental illness rampant in washington dc footage from inside the
[02:07:25.760 --> 02:07:32.400]  capital overturns the story you've heard about january 6 protesters queue up in neat little lines
[02:07:32.400 --> 02:07:37.200]  they give each other tours outside the speaker's office they're not destroying the capital they
[02:07:37.200 --> 02:07:42.880]  obviously revere the capital the controllers and their media minions went on the offensive
[02:07:42.880 --> 02:07:49.600]  doubling down on the big lie using the old tired strategy that had secured their positions lies
[02:07:49.600 --> 02:07:56.640]  baked into an unyielding barrage of mind control repetition the power of repetition uh is such
[02:07:56.640 --> 02:08:02.000]  that you know people like tucker carlson who know they're lying to the public can convince tens of
[02:08:02.000 --> 02:08:09.440]  millions of people of those lies tucker carlson took a page from george allwell's 1984 and told
[02:08:09.440 --> 02:08:17.120]  his viewers to reject the evidence of their eyes and ears is this a lie i think it's bull
[02:08:17.120 --> 02:08:23.200]  fox executive hannity carlson shows are not credible sources of news a hundred officers were
[02:08:23.200 --> 02:08:31.680]  assaulted on that day five officers died who are these five officers who were quote killed that day
[02:08:31.680 --> 02:08:35.840]  notice he didn't tell you no one ever tells you no one ever shows you their autopsies they don't
[02:08:35.840 --> 02:08:40.320]  want any detail they just want the slogan now they're counting brian sick neck that's a lie
[02:08:41.120 --> 02:08:45.360]  but who are the other four well those are four officers who killed themselves these are the
[02:08:45.360 --> 02:08:50.320]  facts they can't dispute here is surveillance footage of sick nick walking in the capital
[02:08:50.320 --> 02:08:56.080]  after he was supposedly murdered by the mob outside by all appearances sick nick is healthy
[02:08:56.080 --> 02:09:01.600]  and vigorous he's wearing a helmet so it's hard to imagine he was killed by a head injury we do
[02:09:01.600 --> 02:09:07.360]  know from contemporaneous videos that a mysterious figure called ray epps encouraged the crowd to
[02:09:07.360 --> 02:09:12.880]  go into the capital for some reason epps has never been indicted for that but there's no question
[02:09:12.880 --> 02:09:19.360]  he did it we need to go into the capital
[02:09:29.040 --> 02:09:35.360]  do not go in there
[02:09:35.360 --> 02:09:42.480]  we did it
[02:09:46.720 --> 02:09:53.440]  dude i was trying to tell you i'll believe how in a free country guided by the constitution
[02:09:53.440 --> 02:09:58.240]  were these people allowed to withhold evidence from jacob changley's lawyer how could that happen
[02:09:58.240 --> 02:10:04.880]  good had you seen that clearly exculpatory tape of your client at trial no
[02:10:12.880 --> 02:10:22.720]  anybody who watched that video uh in a with their own eyes in a real way would disagree with what
[02:10:22.720 --> 02:10:27.920]  was just stated the president has been very clear january 6 was the worst attack on our democracy
[02:10:27.920 --> 02:10:34.720]  since the civil war the worst attack on our democracy since the civil war the weather underground
[02:10:34.720 --> 02:10:41.440]  setting off a bomb in the capital in 1971 and the armed resistance unit doing the same in the senate
[02:10:41.440 --> 02:10:48.240]  in 1983 were the last major attacks on the us capital but there can be no mention of those
[02:10:48.240 --> 02:10:54.080]  attacks because it would surely open old wounds surrounding obama's relationship with bill ares
[02:10:54.080 --> 02:11:00.640]  and bernadine doran and bill clinton's pardoning of 16 members of the faln who blew up innocent
[02:11:00.640 --> 02:11:07.920]  americans at frances tavern where george washington said farewell to his officers in 1783 question
[02:11:07.920 --> 02:11:13.360]  number one why did president obama release the bomber his name was oscar lopez why did they
[02:11:13.360 --> 02:11:18.320]  do it because he agreed with them um lopez was the leader of the faln who bombed frances tavern
[02:11:18.320 --> 02:11:23.520]  they took responsibility for it he's a chicago guy his brother jose is a community organizer in
[02:11:23.520 --> 02:11:30.480]  chicago and he had sympathy in my view um obama sympathy for these terrorists there were going
[02:11:30.480 --> 02:11:36.080]  to be bomb shells throughout the week but it appears tucker was finally roped in by rupert
[02:11:36.080 --> 02:11:42.960]  murdoch's lawyers however house speaker kevin mccarthy is now vowed to release the january 6
[02:11:42.960 --> 02:11:49.440]  security footage to the general public it belongs to the public after all john bound reporting
[02:11:49.440 --> 02:11:55.120]  all right we're going to go a little bit in the next hour uh but uh jay dyer will take over the
[02:11:55.120 --> 02:12:00.640]  last 45 minutes we've got our guests in for roughly a little over an hour part two i've been
[02:12:00.640 --> 02:12:05.920]  rakeland of course the great researcher that's compiled the largest uh group through the different
[02:12:05.920 --> 02:12:09.760]  law firms have gotten pieces of what's been hidden from the public and from some of the human
[02:12:09.760 --> 02:12:15.520]  intelligence footage skier mcbride from m5newsgate.com now we've got a bunch of clips here today we
[02:12:15.520 --> 02:12:21.600]  wouldn't have time to air them all the summer 17 minutes long but we have ray epps has been caught
[02:12:21.600 --> 02:12:29.040]  in the second breach that's not out there yet we have part one uh also uh dealing with the lies
[02:12:29.040 --> 02:12:34.320]  that are being told we have evidence uh also that sheds lights on the prosecutors and all the
[02:12:34.320 --> 02:12:40.160]  corruption going on on the show trials we have police brutality boil downs uh and we have a lot
[02:12:40.160 --> 02:12:45.920]  more here there is a lot to get here and a lot of the stuff's not been seen it's not gotten any
[02:12:45.920 --> 02:12:50.800]  popular attention uh so i've been rakeland i want to go to gary mcbride coming up next segment
[02:12:50.800 --> 02:12:55.440]  but just big picture everything coming out in the hearings yesterday while you were live on air with
[02:12:55.440 --> 02:13:00.560]  me total proof of intelligence agencies private corporations all illegally doing this they're
[02:13:00.560 --> 02:13:05.360]  making about the first amendment that's important but that's a side issue government working with
[02:13:05.360 --> 02:13:10.880]  corporations in secret to surveillance censor people that's serious tyranny serious organized
[02:13:10.880 --> 02:13:16.320]  crime that violates some of the laws you're a lawyer and have been an analyst of the defense
[02:13:16.320 --> 02:13:21.840]  intelligence agency what is your view on that because to me it seems bigger the collusion of
[02:13:21.840 --> 02:13:28.160]  the organized activity to suppress people it's bigger than first amendment no absolutely alex so
[02:13:28.160 --> 02:13:33.760]  i'm out here outside of the dc gulag you can see right behind me uh and basically what's going on
[02:13:33.760 --> 02:13:40.320]  here it's the chinese communist party model taking over our current federal the lawless executive
[02:13:40.320 --> 02:13:45.440]  branch and it's across all institutions essentially i mean we can showcase just four of them over the
[02:13:45.440 --> 02:13:52.320]  last couple days that have been exposed by these committees the dod the doj the dhs the cdc i mean
[02:13:52.320 --> 02:13:56.320]  they weapon i like that we have this weaponization committee and some of these other subcommittees
[02:13:56.320 --> 02:14:01.520]  as part of judiciary earlier today you had tom massie going after the administrative state
[02:14:01.520 --> 02:14:06.400]  it is a completely lawless executive branch that we need to get control over and hopefully we're
[02:14:06.400 --> 02:14:10.960]  going to get to it as we get the truth out how panic do you think the deep state is because
[02:14:10.960 --> 02:14:14.160]  i can look at their body language and their actions and we have internal memos coming out
[02:14:14.160 --> 02:14:18.640]  that i'm not in liberty to get to yet the highest levels they're making mistakes in the courtroom
[02:14:18.640 --> 02:14:24.880]  they're basically they're saying that they need to stop the trials against the proud boys because
[02:14:24.880 --> 02:14:29.360]  oh they accidentally released information that they had confidential human sources and
[02:14:29.360 --> 02:14:34.080]  and uh fbi agents on the capital grounds now whether they were in their official capacity
[02:14:34.080 --> 02:14:38.640]  or their private capacity that's yet to be seen but based on the releases yesterday looks like
[02:14:38.640 --> 02:14:42.560]  not only in their private capacity off duty there were some folks there but also that they were
[02:14:42.560 --> 02:14:48.080]  there officially to include the hypothesis that maybe they were there to support nancy polosi's
[02:14:48.080 --> 02:14:53.040]  operation essentially a covert action on the capital grounds that was headed up by the two
[02:14:53.040 --> 02:14:57.760]  tactical commanders which is outside commander which was ray ups for the outer breach inner breach
[02:14:57.760 --> 02:15:03.040]  team leader ray ups and then you had operational commanders which was her family members daughter
[02:15:03.040 --> 02:15:07.360]  and son-in-law and at the strategic level you had by the way by the way let's go there next
[02:15:07.360 --> 02:15:11.360]  i mean interrupt and we get we go into the next hour too uh but turn out a legal meeting i had to
[02:15:11.360 --> 02:15:14.480]  go to this what we're not doing the the two hours through guys we wish we were maybe we can
[02:15:15.040 --> 02:15:20.560]  have you back on sunday or something we'll do like four hours because i got this intel two days
[02:15:20.560 --> 02:15:26.240]  ago and i was given more access than it's been in the federal filing i'll leave it at what you said
[02:15:26.240 --> 02:15:31.760]  is indeed what's in it it's it's the feds running january six and by the grace of god they leaked all
[02:15:31.760 --> 02:15:36.640]  this uh to the defense lawyers now they've cancelled court you're a lawyer you can speak to it
[02:15:36.640 --> 02:15:40.800]  obviously the folks that have this info are very scared right now this is very dangerous people

[02:20:23.920 --> 02:20:27.920]  so they're obviously out of the cars they have privacy right now and better reception doesn't
[02:20:27.920 --> 02:20:33.680]  work too well inside the capital with those are big marble walls they are with us right now it works
[02:20:33.680 --> 02:20:37.200]  great if you're part of the capital and have access to their wi-fi but they don't so they're
[02:20:37.200 --> 02:20:42.000]  out in their cars right now they're in the sleeting rain we appreciate them being on with us but
[02:20:42.000 --> 02:20:45.600]  there's a lot to cover here and i want to try to go through these clips with them and just cover the
[02:20:45.600 --> 02:20:49.360]  waterfront here but this is the deep stage of typical in america we know it's provocative we
[02:20:49.360 --> 02:20:53.440]  know what happened and i already from people in the trial that i'm not liberty to get into all of it
[02:20:53.440 --> 02:20:58.000]  yet uh because the judge has been blocking it but it's going to be coming out very soon know about
[02:20:58.000 --> 02:21:04.320]  cia sex operatives cia operatives controlling them uh trying to set them up with documents to attack
[02:21:04.320 --> 02:21:09.040]  the capital uh that in ricketario and others said no that's a terrible idea they said it in front
[02:21:09.040 --> 02:21:14.400]  of informants that those informants have testified to the fbi that but the fbi has excised out that
[02:21:14.400 --> 02:21:19.040]  evidence and then cherry picks things they're then presented to the jury out of context without the
[02:21:19.040 --> 02:21:24.240]  informant even being shown and now as i told you when this broke uh wednesday night and then
[02:21:24.240 --> 02:21:28.320]  yesterday we were talking about it they're going to declare national security on it and they did
[02:21:28.320 --> 02:21:32.080]  declare the judge yesterday national security saying that's all classified you can't look at it
[02:21:32.080 --> 02:21:36.560]  and told the lawyers i've talked to that are the proud boy lawyers you're not allowed to read it well
[02:21:36.560 --> 02:21:40.800]  a little too late they have read it uh and they're not and they're saying they're not going to give it
[02:21:40.800 --> 02:21:45.840]  up norm patis said that uh in court show it's extremely damning destroying evidence covering
[02:21:45.840 --> 02:21:50.240]  up the informants inside the system is in full panic mode but it just shows how in every front
[02:21:50.240 --> 02:21:54.240]  whistleblowers are coming out i think the fbi probably leaked to start people on purpose there's
[02:21:54.240 --> 02:22:01.120]  like a people in there everything is being exposed we're in a escalation a cascade right now uh where
[02:22:01.120 --> 02:22:05.920]  you know you hit an ammo depot the analogy with a small mortar round but it blows up a giant ammo
[02:22:05.920 --> 02:22:11.600]  depot and you know takes out a hundred enemy troops i what we're seeing in slow motion is right now
[02:22:11.600 --> 02:22:16.480]  the ammo depot blowing up ivan you're a former combat veteran green beret is that a good analogy
[02:22:16.480 --> 02:22:22.720]  where we're at no i'd say absolutely fantastic analogy i mean it's the domino effect right
[02:22:22.720 --> 02:22:28.560]  chain reaction if you will and like you said slow motion uh i can't i can't say it better

[02:23:04.720 --> 02:23:08.880]  see some of this stuff because he only showed me a little bit when i spent 13 hours with him
[02:23:08.880 --> 02:23:14.240]  and i i want to kind of sit along with you as we both watch it okay gary we'll start getting to
[02:23:14.240 --> 02:23:18.880]  it next segment we'll do two more into the next hour simply a time set the table here in the six
[02:23:18.880 --> 02:23:22.320]  minutes we have left to break about what we're about to see and and where we're about to go
[02:23:25.200 --> 02:23:30.960]  okay so the uh the apps we need to hit on a little bit more especially when it comes to
[02:23:30.960 --> 02:23:38.000]  breach number two um you know like he said earlier it just hasn't got the views that it
[02:23:38.000 --> 02:23:42.880]  needs to for people to see and i want to thank you for letting us come back on and and talking
[02:23:42.880 --> 02:23:50.000]  more about this uh because that apps video is going to show you where um he's involved with
[02:23:50.000 --> 02:23:54.960]  breach number two and then it's going to show the red smoke pop and how we have four in front
[02:23:54.960 --> 02:23:58.960]  people in front of him four people behind him like i said how they give him the hell out of there
[02:23:58.960 --> 02:24:05.920]  so i put it um and just like the sign ramming at the first breach it's all mechanized it's all
[02:24:05.920 --> 02:24:13.200]  military training yeah i haven't you know that's you know i haven't good about recognizing that
[02:24:13.200 --> 02:24:18.240]  and i mean when i saw it it's just you can just you can just see the coordination of it you know
[02:24:18.240 --> 02:24:23.840]  and he and epps even says he got separated from see that picture you're showing right there this
[02:24:23.840 --> 02:24:28.880]  is where it's gonna look at that guy he's covered in blood if you if you rewind and see it before
[02:24:28.880 --> 02:24:34.960]  what happened to him he gets the back of his head pummeled with the bag just watch when he comes in
[02:24:34.960 --> 02:24:39.200]  he's you have to go back further but not much further but but there's a cop on each side of
[02:24:39.200 --> 02:24:43.840]  him holding his arms he has his hands up that's fenone officer fenone spraying people peaceful
[02:24:43.840 --> 02:24:49.440]  protesters look how far back they are fenone is the one that lit the match that started the fire
[02:24:49.440 --> 02:24:54.880]  not guy breath it i will make that before we jump into this then tell us what each clip is
[02:24:54.880 --> 02:24:59.760]  and preface it and we'll go into it okay yeah and like i said breach number two there's gonna and
[02:24:59.760 --> 02:25:03.600]  there's some what i've added right here he's getting beat up right there and then officer
[02:25:03.600 --> 02:25:08.400]  bogner without the helmet stops him and he goes back out to the tunnel to continue whatever he
[02:25:08.400 --> 02:25:12.320]  was doing but that guy's covered in blood look at his hands look at his face watch and get hit
[02:25:12.320 --> 02:25:16.320]  right here on the back of the head it's coming look at his hands look at his face
[02:25:19.360 --> 02:25:22.480]  just keep watching you're gonna see him right here right on the back of his head look at his
[02:25:22.480 --> 02:25:29.440]  hair let's go with a freaking baton this is at the beginning of your show i wrote this down read
[02:25:29.440 --> 02:25:36.720]  that they to reject the evidence we see in here they've been showing us their evidence of what we
[02:25:36.720 --> 02:25:42.160]  see in here and not showing the truth like you see and hear right here and let's be clear most
[02:25:42.160 --> 02:25:47.760]  of this footage has never been seen you've gotten this from defense lawyers i've got it from uh
[02:25:47.760 --> 02:25:53.040]  yeah i've got a source that it came from i'll put it that way alex but i don't it doesn't matter
[02:25:53.040 --> 02:25:58.480]  how i got it i got it and people need to see it okay so give us a preview and i'm gonna come back
[02:25:58.480 --> 02:26:02.960]  give you the floor so we can go through all these one of the clips we're about to see we're gonna
[02:26:02.960 --> 02:26:09.520]  start with the breach too what else we're gonna be covering and then um i want to discuss fenone
[02:26:11.120 --> 02:26:18.880]  michael fenone um in front of the j6 committee in front of the world lied everything that he said
[02:26:18.880 --> 02:26:25.520]  is a complete lie now i don't put anything out unless i show myself proof first and i have to be
[02:26:25.520 --> 02:26:32.080]  that picture right there that's not fenone that is not fenone that is officer b a miller and here's
[02:26:32.080 --> 02:26:38.000]  the interesting thing about that officer b a miller is nowhere in the system he has body
[02:26:38.000 --> 02:26:45.120]  camera on and there's no body camera footage of his off of him there's nothing it's like he doesn't
[02:26:45.120 --> 02:26:50.960]  even exist and they have the people believing that's fenone that's not fenone right there in that
[02:26:50.960 --> 02:26:57.120]  video you're showing that's officer b a miller now what's important here is when he stands up the
[02:26:57.120 --> 02:27:01.840]  protesters surround him protect him and they get him out of there but here's the thing alex to the
[02:27:01.840 --> 02:27:11.280]  right of the tunnel there is a door surrounded by this violet mob these protesters and and there's
[02:27:11.280 --> 02:27:17.520]  three guys that point towards that door when they get b a miller to that door it opens up there's a
[02:27:17.520 --> 02:27:23.680]  gentleman in a suit and a riot spot that's where they deliver b a miller to they open the door if
[02:27:23.680 --> 02:27:27.680]  they were there to kill people that day like they said how bad they make everybody sound they had
[02:27:27.680 --> 02:27:31.520]  an opportunity to take over that door right there they did there's hundreds of people around the
[02:27:31.520 --> 02:27:37.200]  door they did not take that door they delivered the police officer they shut the door and you
[02:27:37.200 --> 02:27:41.040]  never hear about b remember we had a lot of new listeners a lot of people on tv right now and
[02:27:41.040 --> 02:27:46.160]  you're immersed in this you're an expert the guy that's compiled the most uh video of anybody
[02:27:46.160 --> 02:27:51.440]  outside tucker carlson uh now mccarthy says in the next few weeks and i was told this weeks ago i
[02:27:51.440 --> 02:27:55.680]  said it on air but he's going to release it all i was told that by tucker's producers that would
[02:27:55.680 --> 02:27:59.760]  soon be out to everybody um people are criticizing tucker getting the first looks at it so when we
[02:27:59.760 --> 02:28:04.240]  come back i want you to just start with the second breach and then just go through each video and why

[02:32:12.240 --> 02:32:16.880]  savannah have you ever considered that for a second no i'm addicted to helping my fellow
[02:32:16.880 --> 02:32:21.200]  americans i'm addicted to spreading the truth and again i you know i have info words to thank
[02:32:21.200 --> 02:32:26.480]  for that looking back on the day i was able to ask president donald trump two questions i
[02:32:26.480 --> 02:32:31.040]  was so grateful because you know i truly was classically trained under alex jones and under the
[02:32:31.040 --> 02:32:36.880]  info wars team i really do credit that as to why i'm able to you know set these types of clips
[02:32:36.880 --> 02:32:42.320]  because alex's whole mentality was you know go where the story is go where the mainstream media
[02:32:42.320 --> 02:32:47.440]  refuses to so it's not that i'm addicted to the insanity i'm just addicted to telling the truth
[02:32:47.440 --> 02:32:52.160]  and helping the american people and i really do credit alex for you know really instilling that
[02:32:52.160 --> 02:33:03.920]  within me early on in my career leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's
[02:33:03.920 --> 02:33:04.960]  alex jones
[02:33:12.480 --> 02:33:18.960]  defending the republic from enemies foreign and domestic it's alex jones
[02:33:18.960 --> 02:33:25.920]  all right i want the listeners to listen to me very very carefully and i say that respectfully
[02:33:25.920 --> 02:33:30.320]  because i'm so close to the fight and so close to the problem i'm like you we just get used to the
[02:33:30.320 --> 02:33:34.640]  evil we got to always dial back and go whoa this is a big deal like what redfield did in the last
[02:33:34.640 --> 02:33:39.120]  two days going state's evidence it was all a pentagon operation man-made bio weapon they're
[02:33:39.120 --> 02:33:43.520]  all covering it up earth shattering getting some attention not enough i just got chills
[02:33:43.520 --> 02:33:48.000]  all the other stuff just it's earth shattering huge bombshell we got to recognize that god is
[02:33:48.000 --> 02:33:53.760]  literally delivering us the tools to bring down our enemies peacefully right now no that said
[02:33:54.640 --> 02:34:01.120]  without getting into inside baseball tucker carlson has the stuff that our guest has and that nobody
[02:34:01.120 --> 02:34:07.360]  else has tucker went and got it from congress our guests got seven to ten thousand hours from lawyers
[02:34:07.360 --> 02:34:13.360]  sources whistleblowers a lot of it government footage you saw police footage of them beating
[02:34:13.360 --> 02:34:20.240]  unarmed peaceful people begging for help inside their little dungeon so in many ways and i'm not
[02:34:20.240 --> 02:34:25.040]  trying to top carlson i just want to beat these people what you're seeing here is more bombshell
[02:34:25.040 --> 02:34:29.760]  than what tucker showed monday and then you notice everything stopped and that's because
[02:34:29.760 --> 02:34:34.320]  we know the screws were put to him he's pledged it's going to come out at some point now mccartney
[02:34:34.320 --> 02:34:37.760]  said screw it we're releasing it to everybody let's see him try to cover it up now and who knows
[02:34:37.760 --> 02:34:42.160]  what we'll get you know and the rest of that footage that nobody's seen but tucker and our guests
[02:34:42.160 --> 02:34:48.080]  who from sources and law firms and other areas got footage from inside the government and i'm
[02:34:48.080 --> 02:34:53.200]  telling you i'm watching the stuff during the break since we got it a few a while ago and we
[02:34:53.200 --> 02:34:58.960]  should probably just do three hours sunday on this uh because there's no way in the time we
[02:34:58.960 --> 02:35:03.360]  have to cover it properly but i'm going to try to shut up now gary mcbride the researcher that was
[02:35:03.360 --> 02:35:09.360]  you know in the last couple years working on this m5newscape.com and let's start with the breach
[02:35:09.360 --> 02:35:14.080]  number two and then let's go through these different clips we'll let's describe what part two is it's
[02:35:14.080 --> 02:35:18.720]  too long 17 minutes but i think we get to all the other clips so just describe them and then nail
[02:35:18.720 --> 02:35:23.760]  them and let's get to them so you're in charge go ahead okay no and if you have any questions or like
[02:35:23.760 --> 02:35:27.600]  you said you're watching it you want to jump to it let's just jump to it and and i'll do better
[02:35:27.600 --> 02:35:32.640]  about putting time stamps on it now so that i'm new at doing this so i just learned something so
[02:35:32.640 --> 02:35:37.520]  i'll do that to make it easier on your people so uh yeah breach number two uh the reason it's so
[02:35:37.520 --> 02:35:44.240]  important is that um there is a breach number two that i uncovered and it shows him when he gets to
[02:35:44.240 --> 02:35:49.440]  the the the fencing there by the media tower he's pointing down at the fencing and he's talking to
[02:35:49.440 --> 02:35:55.920]  some guys there and what ebbz does as he always does is he'll instruct he'll guide he'll whatever
[02:35:55.920 --> 02:36:01.120]  then he backs up and he's gonna look over to his left and he's gonna do the same thing he's talking
[02:36:01.120 --> 02:36:06.640]  to somebody or whatever but then they go through exactly where he points at and they go through
[02:36:06.640 --> 02:36:10.640]  that fencing and that circle right there that's that's that's right there so they'll go through
[02:36:10.640 --> 02:36:19.840]  exactly where he points at and um during the um say this during the proud boys trial the prosecution
[02:36:19.840 --> 02:36:25.040]  showed this footage not my footage they showed this uh this footage that doesn't have any circles on
[02:36:25.040 --> 02:36:31.440]  it like mine but they put a glitch over it blocking what he's doing what ebbz is doing the reason is
[02:36:31.440 --> 02:36:35.200]  it's because they're trying to blame the proud boys of doing this breaking this fencing going
[02:36:35.200 --> 02:36:40.000]  through which is a total lie and i sat in the courtroom i'm outside the courtroom right now
[02:36:40.000 --> 02:36:46.960]  nicole reffit she's she's my partner in crime is going to say she's got the knowledge of everything
[02:36:46.960 --> 02:36:50.640]  more than anyone that's happening in the courtroom that's where she's at soon we're done here i'm
[02:36:50.640 --> 02:36:57.040]  going in and i when i saw that footage and i talked to her at castronova that's manipulated and i
[02:36:57.040 --> 02:37:01.920]  showed her what i have that's not manipulated and so they're doing this in the courtrooms
[02:37:01.920 --> 02:37:05.760]  but what are they're making a mistake at is when i go sit in there i'm gonna catch it
[02:37:05.760 --> 02:37:10.240]  and they're not gonna get away with it because i've watched too much to have anything put past me
[02:37:11.040 --> 02:37:14.480]  and when he goes through you'll see him going through right there that's exactly where he
[02:37:14.480 --> 02:37:20.000]  pointed at and he'll come through right after that and i've got it circled but the next thing if you
[02:37:20.000 --> 02:37:26.880]  can get them to uh that's important to go to if you can go to where the red smoke pops and it'll
[02:37:26.880 --> 02:37:32.880]  be from yeah there you go it'll be from that uh arab's top of the capital um when that red smoke
[02:37:32.880 --> 02:37:39.200]  pops he claims he was there with his i believe his nephew maybe and they got separated and um
[02:37:39.840 --> 02:37:43.440]  it's kind of hard to believe that he was by himself when he clearly has
[02:37:44.160 --> 02:37:48.400]  or in front of him or behind him and they get there we go here's the red smoke
[02:37:48.400 --> 02:37:58.480]  so as soon as that's over with i'll i'll mark it on here so people see which was 30 seconds later
[02:37:58.480 --> 02:38:02.400]  and here it is right here right it's leaving and you just got a mission accomplished point where they
[02:38:02.400 --> 02:38:10.480]  now evacue him yes yes that job's done and if you notice everybody on the the terrace there that
[02:38:10.480 --> 02:38:15.040]  are going all the protesters are already working their way up up towards the tunnel look at all
[02:38:15.040 --> 02:38:20.960]  those people they they got a much they got as much people it's there we've we've got advanced to the
[02:38:20.960 --> 02:38:27.600]  next level now let's move on to the next stage basically the way i see it uh which was the tunnel
[02:38:28.240 --> 02:38:31.680]  but you're going to see it when he starts walking out i'll mark it so you can see the
[02:38:31.680 --> 02:38:35.280]  four in front of him and the four behind him and what's interesting alex and i learned while doing
[02:38:35.280 --> 02:38:42.080]  this when you fast forward this footage you see the movement of so many people it almost leaves
[02:38:42.080 --> 02:38:46.240]  leaves like a human trail i explained it like an ant farm when you're a kid if you had an ant farm
[02:38:46.240 --> 02:38:51.760]  and had had the trails that's kind of how i picture picture when i fast forward you can see a lot of
[02:38:51.760 --> 02:38:57.200]  movement through the crowd like a human trail left behind so when epps leaves um he's got four in
[02:38:57.200 --> 02:39:00.720]  front like i said four behind him and they go behind the media tower go along the wall and
[02:39:00.720 --> 02:39:07.680]  they're out of there um and people have to see this because they're not going to see it anywhere
[02:39:07.680 --> 02:39:12.400]  else you know what i mean um and you're talking about juggling balls yesterday and i'm going to
[02:39:12.400 --> 02:39:17.440]  say this hope you don't get upset but at least you have the balls to bring us on to talk about this
[02:39:17.440 --> 02:39:24.000]  because i contacted tucker last year with what i have and he didn't accept it he's known about
[02:39:24.000 --> 02:39:30.240]  what i've had this long and what pisses me off is these guys are still sitting in jail since then
[02:39:30.240 --> 02:39:34.720]  and when i wake up they're still sitting in jail and it's time to get this out so that people see
[02:39:34.720 --> 02:39:39.600]  the truth and that's all i'm going to do i'm going to present the truth and i won't put nothing out
[02:39:39.600 --> 02:39:45.440]  unless i show myself proof first because i'm not going to be that um um i'm not going to be biased
[02:39:45.440 --> 02:39:49.920]  about anything like i like i said if it's good or bad i'm going to show it it needs to be shown
[02:39:49.920 --> 02:39:57.520]  but they've already shown what they want us to see and hear and that's time to see and hear the truth
[02:39:57.520 --> 02:40:01.360]  now let's go before we're going to break to clip four of this police brutality
[02:40:01.360 --> 02:40:05.600]  tell us what we're seeing in clip four
[02:40:05.600 --> 02:40:08.960]  here about the smoke i want to give a little bit of perspective on that okay yeah so let's talk
[02:40:08.960 --> 02:40:14.480]  about the second breach go ahead yeah so basically i've been articulating the first breach we saw it
[02:40:14.480 --> 02:40:19.280]  occurred over there with ryan samson by reyep's whispering in his ear and then you can see he
[02:40:19.280 --> 02:40:24.080]  kind of stops and waits for everybody else to breach once everybody else breaches then he goes
[02:40:24.080 --> 02:40:28.240]  into that next wave and starts to set up a stage in that secondary area for the second breach
[02:40:28.240 --> 02:40:35.120]  the red smoke is essentially i argue that it's probably the almost certainly the signal
[02:40:35.680 --> 02:40:42.560]  to john sullivan and the antifa black block team to tell them yep you are now taking
[02:40:43.600 --> 02:40:48.960]  over our breach team and now you continue on with the inter breach meaning as soon as we
[02:40:48.960 --> 02:40:54.880]  there's enough people stage right outside of the walls of the capital you then go ahead and initiate
[02:40:54.880 --> 02:40:59.440]  that's right once they breach and get some of the crowd to go in that's now the cover for the
[02:40:59.440 --> 02:41:08.320]  antiva team absolutely that was that was a smoke signal that everybody could see that you know
[02:41:08.320 --> 02:41:14.160]  outer breach mission complete inter breach you are now transitioning and taking over the operation
[02:41:14.160 --> 02:41:17.760]  that's how i for those that don't know going back thousands of years but particularly in
[02:41:17.760 --> 02:41:23.040]  vietnam world war two explain how even the modern military smoke is used to no matter what the
[02:41:23.040 --> 02:41:32.560]  signals are are are identified i mean yeah absolutely i mean that's the easiest analog
[02:41:32.560 --> 02:41:39.120]  i mean rain shine it doesn't matter the weather that is the the best signal that you can provide
[02:41:39.120 --> 02:41:43.680]  in a tactical environment like that especially with uh there's a lot of unknowns that could happen
[02:41:43.680 --> 02:41:49.360]  so i mean that's that's the tried and true method to to hand over uh and transition to another team
[02:41:49.360 --> 02:41:55.120]  to take over and before that they had pennants and flags that way no matter what everybody can see it
[02:41:55.120 --> 02:41:59.680]  it's totally clear the enemy hasn't captured it you know what's going on generally in the military
[02:41:59.680 --> 02:42:04.240]  what does a red signal mean or i guess they can change them around but but what does red usually
[02:42:04.240 --> 02:42:11.360]  signify now it it really depends on the mission commander on which one they want to choose that
[02:42:11.360 --> 02:42:15.680]  they're really it's fluid right it's ad hoc it's what you well i think they knew there could have
[02:42:15.680 --> 02:42:20.400]  already been white smoke because of uh because of tear gas so red's one that they knew that probably
[02:42:20.400 --> 02:42:25.120]  nobody else would have right obviously it's different than the white smoke that was uh
[02:42:25.120 --> 02:42:32.000]  well that was out there so uh definitely distinct from the other potential smoke that could be out
[02:42:32.000 --> 02:42:36.640]  there and so that's probably why they chose the red so they plan this out to great detail
[02:42:36.640 --> 02:42:47.360]  they had to have i mean i'm looking at this and that couple with that flare you know the flare
[02:42:47.360 --> 02:42:54.640]  that we talked about yesterday those are obviously signals to someone stay right there forever
[02:42:59.120 --> 02:43:05.120]  right now i'm not talking to the viewers and listeners that have gone to info or store.com

[02:47:45.280 --> 02:47:49.840]  who's got it from government sources and more let's skip to the police brutality and then back
[02:47:49.840 --> 02:47:54.560]  to the official police story not being true when we start the next hour you talked about this when
[02:47:54.560 --> 02:47:57.680]  you first came home and i would describe it because we're on hundreds of radio stations
[02:47:57.680 --> 02:48:03.280]  for people so on the first of part two before we get to a phenomenon you show a man with his
[02:48:03.280 --> 02:48:08.080]  hands up already bloody being brought him being beaten ahead with a billy club just to illustrate
[02:48:08.080 --> 02:48:12.320]  what we're dealing with and then we'll play clip four and five and others showing more police
[02:48:12.320 --> 02:48:17.520]  brutality remember five citizens were shot and beaten to death and thrown off parapets that day
[02:48:17.520 --> 02:48:25.120]  we're told five officers died that day when it's not true gary mcbride yeah it's not true this is
[02:48:25.120 --> 02:48:32.240]  excessive use of force just like on rosa and boiling it's excessive use of force uh i i uncovered
[02:48:32.240 --> 02:48:38.880]  rosa and spoiling and lila morris the officer with the mpdc that beat rosa and while she laid on
[02:48:38.880 --> 02:48:46.000]  the ground um and i filed a complaint against her with the mpdc and they did an investigation i've
[02:48:46.000 --> 02:48:50.960]  got a 20-something page email thread of that to prove it and they came back to me and said what
[02:48:50.960 --> 02:48:56.880]  lila morris did rosa and boiling was it was objectively reasonable which is
[02:48:58.240 --> 02:49:03.760]  it's bs i mean you do not beat an unconscious woman while she's on the ground she is no threat
[02:49:03.760 --> 02:49:08.240]  this guy's no threat his back is turned he's got a cop on each side holding his arms and his hands
[02:49:08.240 --> 02:49:13.360]  are up and the cop behind him is beating the crap out of him this cop pushes him off and as soon as
[02:49:13.360 --> 02:49:19.040]  that cop right there on the motorcycle cop pushes him off his name plate is no longer on him
[02:49:19.040 --> 02:49:24.640]  his name plate was on the floor and i still can't get his name so when i'm around here i see a cop
[02:49:24.640 --> 02:49:30.960]  his size i start running as fast as i can to see if it's him i mean this there's he needs to be
[02:49:30.960 --> 02:49:36.240]  investigated and if the j6 committee would have done their job people like myself and others wouldn't
[02:49:36.240 --> 02:49:40.320]  have to do it but i'm glad that they slipped up i'm glad that they went after one man because
[02:49:40.320 --> 02:49:47.520]  people like us you alex we the people we're gonna do this because they're not they're fearful right
[02:49:47.520 --> 02:49:50.880]  now for what we're uncovering and what we're seeing that's why they're scrambling right now
[02:49:50.880 --> 02:49:54.640]  trying to figure out how to do damage control but it's too late there's no way they can do
[02:49:54.640 --> 02:50:00.000]  damage control now my my eyes they're done and i'm not gonna stop until they're done and every
[02:50:00.000 --> 02:50:09.600]  j6ers out of jail and they get the correct uh they're being sentenced off of claims that are
[02:50:09.600 --> 02:50:14.320]  narratives that are built up that do not show anything else other than what they want you to
[02:50:14.320 --> 02:50:19.440]  see are here but then when we come out with it then they start this vs like they always do turning it
[02:50:19.440 --> 02:50:23.600]  making it sound like we're lined with what we're going to show you and what you're going to hear
[02:50:23.600 --> 02:50:27.440]  i'm not going to plant the seed in people's heads as far as what you're going to see are here just
[02:50:27.440 --> 02:50:31.680]  watch it and the footage if mccarthy comes out with everything these guys are going to sit in
[02:50:31.680 --> 02:50:35.520]  jail for months and months and months because i know what it takes to go through it like this
[02:50:35.520 --> 02:50:39.440]  cop right here shooting pepperballs at a crowd that can't move it's just like shooting fish in a tank
[02:50:39.440 --> 02:50:44.640]  they can't move and he's just shooting them with pepperballs over and over again this guy right here
[02:50:44.640 --> 02:50:50.880]  you know it's um it's ridiculous that's where a that's where a plastic bullet's gone through his cheek
[02:50:51.840 --> 02:50:55.920]  yes sir yes sir and that's derrick varga right there that gets pushed off the wall
[02:50:56.560 --> 02:51:01.920]  derrick varga and to me that's a tipped murder i mean grabbing there's a bunch of cops they're
[02:51:01.920 --> 02:51:05.840]  grabbing pulling them over rest and do whatever you gotta do don't push him well the point is is
[02:51:05.840 --> 02:51:10.800]  they had half the police go do crowd control they they knew a bunch of people were coming to speak at
[02:51:10.800 --> 02:51:15.600]  the stage the other side with trump uh they had provocateurs to attack the cops the cops were set
[02:51:15.600 --> 02:51:21.120]  up as well they then attack back the crowd gets mad ray ebson people breach through the first group
[02:51:21.120 --> 02:51:25.600]  and then everybody goes in and there's a second breach the cops are outnumbered they get out of
[02:51:25.600 --> 02:51:30.800]  control they kill five citizens and then the media turns it all around that we killed five of them
[02:51:30.800 --> 02:51:35.040]  so i see the police i'm not lionizing i'm not defending them but but they didn't know what was
[02:51:35.040 --> 02:51:39.520]  going on remember for hours they were calling back for directives and for backup and no one was
[02:51:39.520 --> 02:51:46.320]  responding for the first time ever because they didn't want to be on the record yeah exactly so i
[02:51:46.320 --> 02:51:50.720]  see i see i'm not defending them for killing bad it's terrible the guys should go to jail the bad
[02:51:50.720 --> 02:51:55.440]  cops are bad but i'm saying the police i agree and the citizens were played off against each other
[02:51:55.440 --> 02:52:02.000]  both sides being set up both sides victims i agree 100 there are good cops bad cops good
[02:52:02.000 --> 02:52:06.960]  protesters bad protesters absolutely i agree with that a hundred percent and that's what happened
[02:52:06.960 --> 02:52:12.640]  that it and as we go further along you know like you give us more time it's it's because i have so
[02:52:12.640 --> 02:52:18.800]  much to show and to talk about you're gonna see how it's planned and coordinated and and the reason why
[02:52:18.800 --> 02:52:25.600]  capital police wasn't they weren't full they didn't have other police there that day because pelosi
[02:52:25.600 --> 02:52:31.680]  that's her police that's her army whatever you're gonna call them and so um there's more evidence
[02:52:31.680 --> 02:52:38.160]  to show that there wasn't a full force that day with the amount of people uh listening to trump
[02:52:38.160 --> 02:52:42.560]  that day and we know trump wanted 10 000 troops for crowd control and it got refused from him
[02:52:43.360 --> 02:52:47.120]  yes sir i've been let's talk about that let's bring in i've been rakeland again i know you're
[02:52:47.120 --> 02:52:50.800]  covering the trial the proud boys you've already sent us a bunch of clips it's hard to get to all
[02:52:50.800 --> 02:52:55.360]  of them but we need to take our time get a big list there's so many of me here and and maybe even do
[02:52:55.360 --> 02:52:59.760]  a commercial free show where we can walk through all this but uh i've been rakeland with your
[02:52:59.760 --> 02:53:06.480]  military background defense intelligence and more looking at all of this uh to me this is a classic
[02:53:06.480 --> 02:53:12.080]  stand-down operation with provocateurs i mean it's been proven that they were there the question was
[02:53:12.880 --> 02:53:16.480]  now that we know they had a bunch of informants inside the proud boys and other groups
[02:53:17.760 --> 02:53:21.280]  basically trying to lead them into this but even the informants according to the lawyers i've talked
[02:53:21.280 --> 02:53:25.360]  to in the documents said no that none of them ever wanted violence they were there to be defensive
[02:53:25.360 --> 02:53:31.200]  so if this information all comes out this they should have to free all these people yeah absolutely
[02:53:31.200 --> 02:53:36.640]  so let me set the strategic frame once again a little bit more detail if i may alex so when i
[02:53:36.640 --> 02:53:42.400]  when you look at the us code as it applies to the capital police board there's really four people
[02:53:42.400 --> 02:53:47.920]  that are the ones that provide law enforcement decision making for the capital grounds you have
[02:53:47.920 --> 02:53:53.360]  the us capital police chief non-voting member you have these two sergeants at arms house and senate
[02:53:53.360 --> 02:53:57.840]  and then you have the capital architect well guess what the capital architect was just fired
[02:53:57.840 --> 02:54:03.280]  because he wasn't even at the capital on january 6 he was teleworking right so then that leaves you
[02:54:03.280 --> 02:54:07.920]  with two other individuals that are voting members the house and senate sergeants that are well guess
[02:54:07.920 --> 02:54:13.520]  what the joint session occurred in the house side so if he is house sergeant ours paul urving is in
[02:54:13.520 --> 02:54:20.640]  on it with nancy pelosi they're the ones that get to decide on what the the uh security posture is
[02:54:20.640 --> 02:54:26.320]  going to be on in the on the capital grounds especially as it applies to the house and then
[02:54:26.320 --> 02:54:31.440]  if mitch mcconnell's in on it as a senate majority leader with his senate sergeant at arms then guess
[02:54:31.440 --> 02:54:37.200]  what the entirety of the capital complex and then the extended jurisdiction fall within the us
[02:54:37.200 --> 02:54:44.080]  capital police responsibility and i agree with you that the us capital police basically they
[02:54:44.080 --> 02:54:49.440]  they were not on an all hands on deck posture that day even though the chief of capital police
[02:54:49.440 --> 02:54:55.360]  chief son requested on six occasions from january third uh in order to have additional support so
[02:54:55.360 --> 02:55:01.440]  not only did they refuse they being mayor of dc and nancy pelosi refuse any executive branch
[02:55:01.440 --> 02:55:09.680]  support from do d dhs or doj in the form of uh law enforcement or national guard they in addition
[02:55:09.680 --> 02:55:16.560]  to that refused additional support by the capital police's own and then on top of that i argue that
[02:55:16.560 --> 02:55:23.440]  they probably they being nancy pelosi sergeant at arms uh and then other of their surrogates were
[02:55:23.440 --> 02:55:29.280]  the ones that created the diversion at the dnc and rnc with the pipe bomb i have a very high level
[02:55:29.280 --> 02:55:35.280]  source that didn't want me to name who they are that can attest that what happened at the dnc or
[02:55:35.280 --> 02:55:41.840]  excuse me at the rnc with the pipe bomb guess what it was a total distraction diversion uh and again
[02:55:41.840 --> 02:55:46.480]  i don't want all of them come out when they want to come out but i've been investigating this at
[02:55:46.480 --> 02:55:52.960]  that like big picture level and then framing it within the legal jurisdictional frame of how
[02:55:52.960 --> 02:55:58.800]  nancy pelosi could have conducted this in order to explain away all these different anomalies of
[02:55:58.800 --> 02:56:04.080]  ray abs john sullivan and some other folks that literally will were pulled off of the fbi's most
[02:56:04.080 --> 02:56:09.040]  wanted list and i argues because the fbi probably reached out and said hey this person this person
[02:56:09.040 --> 02:56:14.160]  needs to be uh prosecuted and then on the other side of the phone call the capital police board says
[02:56:14.160 --> 02:56:18.560]  no we're not going to prosecute them and we're not going to tell you why meanwhile the reason being
[02:56:18.560 --> 02:56:24.960]  is because they participated and and conducted essentially a coup if you will just like they
[02:56:24.960 --> 02:56:30.320]  were saying that it was the most violent thing ever to occur in our nation's democracy it was
[02:56:30.320 --> 02:56:38.480]  because nancy pelosi and her her surrogates and her i guess progeny if you will yes they participated
[02:56:38.480 --> 02:56:44.000]  in a coup on the constitutional order well i gotta tell you we're starting to finally get to it
[02:56:44.000 --> 02:56:49.200]  absolutely they meant it to be much worse so they could trick more people to go in they had the fake
[02:56:49.200 --> 02:56:52.960]  coup people saying overthrow kill everybody arrest everybody that was a background noise
[02:56:52.960 --> 02:56:56.800]  and the crowd would have bought into that this could have been 10 times worse that's why their
[02:56:56.800 --> 02:57:01.680]  scripts were so dire pearl harbor you know all the dead everything because it was supposed to be
[02:57:01.680 --> 02:57:05.680]  much worse it didn't happen they still had a script to follow they were all within hours the
[02:57:05.680 --> 02:57:13.840]  exact same script yeah absolutely that narrative bottom line is what she essentially refused support
[02:57:13.840 --> 02:57:18.720]  created the frame to divert half of the us capital police down to the dnc and rnc pipe bomb
[02:57:18.720 --> 02:57:24.240]  meanwhile amidst all that while they're getting kind of you know caught off guard trying to protect
[02:57:24.240 --> 02:57:30.560]  the capital she has her agent provocateurs amidst that entire ecosystem to get up to the capital
[02:57:30.560 --> 02:57:35.840]  and then the us capital police are trying to defend the line and then you have others within the us
[02:57:35.840 --> 02:57:40.320]  capital police and then the metropolitan police department literally shooting those grenades
[02:57:40.320 --> 02:57:45.760]  that you see into the line so that everybody's choked and smoked right back stay with us

[03:00:15.840 --> 03:00:19.840]  officer that we're always hearing about that tells us this official story that he's saying
[03:00:19.840 --> 03:00:24.960]  doesn't match up and then jay dyer is going to take over i'll destroy your three pm way back
[03:00:24.960 --> 03:00:30.320]  tomorrow with a live show because at 11 a.m commercial free general flin will be joining us
[03:00:30.320 --> 03:00:35.600]  live at noon tomorrow central time info wars dot com port slash show band up video so i've been
[03:00:35.600 --> 03:00:37.440]  you're making a point when you got cut off by the break
[03:00:41.840 --> 03:00:47.280]  yes so basically what i'm getting at is that the i mean as the diversion was going on
[03:00:47.280 --> 03:00:56.400]  on the screen here as the diversion was going on we have the us capital police they form a line
[03:00:56.400 --> 03:01:01.360]  in that second breach area that was just mentioned with the video right right there you got in front
[03:01:01.360 --> 03:01:06.880]  of us and you can see that either metropolitan police department or us capital police actually
[03:01:06.880 --> 03:01:12.960]  shoot into their own line and then smoke out because no one has a mask on amongst that first
[03:01:12.960 --> 03:01:18.000]  line so they shoot into their own crowd whether it's intentionally or negligently and then it
[03:01:18.000 --> 03:01:24.320]  breaks the line to open it up and then meanwhile not only are the police officers trying to uh
[03:01:24.320 --> 03:01:30.080]  get some oxygen by breaking the line but also those uh i guess election integrity rally attendees
[03:01:30.080 --> 03:01:34.320]  that are up close they can't breathe either and there's no way for them to go back to try to find
[03:01:34.320 --> 03:01:38.880]  a spot sure watching this you can see that they shot the cops on purpose they didn't have a bunch
[03:01:38.880 --> 03:01:43.440]  of cops all miss and shoot the cops in the back and they didn't have guys up the scaffolding to
[03:01:43.440 --> 03:01:48.240]  stir the crowd up shooting them for a reason going outside training and policy you can see them poking
[03:01:48.240 --> 03:01:52.880]  the bear or throwing spikes in the back of the bull like a bullfighter does to get it riled up
[03:01:52.880 --> 03:01:59.440]  and out of its mind this is all operation matador right so we we need to find out who did the smoke
[03:01:59.440 --> 03:02:04.000]  in terms of the signal the red smoke signal gary if we can get to that uh that would be a key
[03:02:04.000 --> 03:02:09.200]  indicator of who's involved in this and number two who was the police officer that shot into the
[03:02:09.200 --> 03:02:15.680]  back of the the of that first that last line of defense if you will that smoked out the crowd
[03:02:15.680 --> 03:02:18.960]  and that instigated everybody to kind of break through because at the end of the day most of
[03:02:18.960 --> 03:02:24.400]  these people are acting for self uh preservation both uh rally attendees and then the police so
[03:02:24.400 --> 03:02:28.000]  that they could actually have some oxygen to breathe because they didn't have masks so we need
[03:02:28.000 --> 03:02:32.080]  to find out who shot that in there and then they need to be held to account there's a lot more
[03:02:32.080 --> 03:02:34.640]  that's going to be uncovered as we further investigate this
[03:02:37.600 --> 03:02:38.960]  absolutely anything else i've been
[03:02:42.080 --> 03:02:48.720]  no i mean uh uh there's a lot to talk about the bottom line is some of the key people that need
[03:02:48.720 --> 03:02:53.040]  to be investigated with this new house administration subcommittee on oversight headed up by barry
[03:02:53.040 --> 03:02:58.320]  louder mulch they need to focus on Nancy Pelosi getting all of her records emails phone calls text
[03:02:58.320 --> 03:03:03.680]  her daughter alexander polosi her son-in-law michael voss her sergeant arms at the time
[03:03:03.680 --> 03:03:09.040]  paul erving uh the head of security at the rnc the head of security at the dnc the secret
[03:03:09.040 --> 03:03:13.600]  service agents that were there for uh mike pence mike pence needs to be questioned and investigated
[03:03:13.600 --> 03:03:17.920]  the secret service agents for kamala harris that were supposedly with her at the dnc at the time
[03:03:17.920 --> 03:03:21.600]  that those pipe bottles and i mean i totally agree with you and look at all the whistleblowing
[03:03:21.600 --> 03:03:26.320]  already happening from the fbi everywhere the deep state's got to be scared because so much of
[03:03:26.320 --> 03:03:31.040]  this stuff's leaking right now i'd call this the season the season of the leaks for the deep state
[03:03:32.640 --> 03:03:37.120]  oh absolutely so earlier today i was up there in the house and uh tom massey had a subcommittee
[03:03:37.120 --> 03:03:43.040]  hearing also the uh house uh administration committee on subcommittee on elections headed
[03:03:43.040 --> 03:03:48.000]  up by uh what's her name laurel lee who used to be the secretary of state in florida she's
[03:03:48.000 --> 03:03:52.000]  heading up the elections committee down there and i approached her afterwards and said guess what
[03:03:52.000 --> 03:03:58.080]  ma'am the joint set the january sixth joint session did not have a forum you might want to
[03:03:58.080 --> 03:04:03.520]  actually redo the joint session lawfully under the 12th amendment by the way i saw this there's
[03:04:03.520 --> 03:04:08.560]  a committee now to investigate january sixth committee yeah so these are the individuals
[03:04:08.560 --> 03:04:13.440]  that are going to be doing a very loud remote congressman morgan griffin congressman despacito
[03:04:13.440 --> 03:04:18.720]  from new york i mean i wrote a subsec specifically identifying who's who as well as the staffers
[03:04:18.720 --> 03:04:22.400]  that are going to be involved and uh i actually talked to them earlier today and and i get it
[03:04:22.400 --> 03:04:25.920]  they don't want to do it but at the end of the day i mean we're going to push all right i've been

[03:06:35.440 --> 03:06:41.600]  uh but let's let's get to let's get to this officer that's the spokesperson january 6 and what you
[03:06:41.600 --> 03:06:50.720]  compiled okay going to finone um in that video that i sent y'all they can find um on my rumble page
[03:06:50.720 --> 03:06:59.120]  in youtube um finone he's he's a complete liar and they want to talk about his book about hold
[03:06:59.120 --> 03:07:04.720]  the line his book should be titled hold a lie because i can take what he wrote in his book i can
[03:07:04.720 --> 03:07:11.120]  take footage when he was on another show and his stories changed three times um about how he was
[03:07:11.120 --> 03:07:16.960]  dragged out of the tunnel um he was not dragged out of the tunnel he walked out of the tunnel with
[03:07:16.960 --> 03:07:23.680]  somebody and the only true thing i want to put put this point across the only true thing for
[03:07:23.680 --> 03:07:30.800]  known said was i've got it now he claims that they said take his gun shoot him with his own gun
[03:07:30.800 --> 03:07:37.120]  that was not true it was true that they said take his gun the reason they said take his gun is because
[03:07:37.120 --> 03:07:43.200]  he is leaning over trying to unhoster his gun kyle young went in and stopped him from unhostering
[03:07:43.200 --> 03:07:49.200]  his gun kyle young was sentenced he was found guilty for touching his wrist kyle young is a
[03:07:49.200 --> 03:07:54.320]  freaking hero because he kept from known from shooting people that day when they take finone
[03:07:54.320 --> 03:07:57.840]  back to the police i'm gonna be quick through this when they take him back up into the police
[03:07:57.840 --> 03:08:03.040]  he acts like he passes out um there's nothing on the back of his neck that talks about where he got
[03:08:03.040 --> 03:08:07.200]  tased three times he got tased one time he's got a protective vest on with a high collar
[03:08:07.200 --> 03:08:13.120]  that's what the taser hit he's gonna feel a jolt okay it did not scar him like the pictures they
[03:08:13.120 --> 03:08:17.600]  just came out with a couple of months ago on the back of his neck showing scars on the back of his
[03:08:17.600 --> 03:08:22.560]  neck in this video you'll see finone fall over when he acts like he passes out that shows his neck
[03:08:22.560 --> 03:08:29.200]  there's no march on his neck but now he has scars on his neck when they drag finone into the capital
[03:08:29.200 --> 03:08:35.280]  into the west tunnel into the hallway he's acting like he's passed out he is not passed out
[03:08:35.280 --> 03:08:39.360]  matter of fact the j6 committee and i'd love to be a part of that investigation the j6 committee
[03:08:39.360 --> 03:08:45.120]  you save time by bringing me on because when they drag him off and they turn the corner he opens his
[03:08:45.120 --> 03:08:49.520]  eyes and he looks around and then closes his eyes again now i'm gonna jump a little bit further
[03:08:49.520 --> 03:08:54.560]  there's foot and i show the footage in my video when he gets outside remember they said he had
[03:08:54.560 --> 03:08:59.680]  two heart attacks tased in the back and then that back of the neck kicked in the head beat with
[03:08:59.680 --> 03:09:06.880]  flag poles it's all bs the person the cop that was drugged down the steps head first and it's
[03:09:06.880 --> 03:09:13.520]  aerial picture that's ba miller let me tell you this ba miller has a body camera on there's no
[03:09:13.520 --> 03:09:18.000]  body camera footage of ba miller as a matter of fact when you look into it and you type his name
[03:09:18.000 --> 03:09:24.320]  in to the data where i got all this stuff there's no ba miller it's like he does not exist the reason
[03:09:24.320 --> 03:09:29.760]  he does not exist is they want you to think that's finone that was drugged down the steps head first
[03:09:29.760 --> 03:09:34.960]  it's not finone people it's ba miller ba miller should have went to the super bowl not finone
[03:09:36.080 --> 03:09:40.640]  it's a complete lie they're making and right there that picture right there that was not ba
[03:09:40.640 --> 03:09:46.080]  miller i mean that was not finone that's ba miller um i'm gonna jump back real quick off the finone
[03:09:46.080 --> 03:09:51.040]  just for a second because you showed footage of confit simons trial with genel that image though
[03:09:51.040 --> 03:09:58.000]  that footage was manipulated that confit simons had a white coat on with a black sleeve there's
[03:09:58.000 --> 03:10:05.760]  a person holding on to genel's shield and that black sleeve turns white to make it look like
[03:10:05.760 --> 03:10:13.520]  it's fit simons and it's not i turned that footage over to natasha taylor smith which was
[03:10:13.520 --> 03:10:19.120]  fit simons attorney she presented it in the court submitted the two videos that i sent her
[03:10:19.760 --> 03:10:23.040]  the judge asked her where you got the footage it was sent to us last night he's going to come back
[03:10:23.040 --> 03:10:28.880]  with sentencing in two weeks it took him seven weeks and he found fit simons guilty on all accounts
[03:10:28.880 --> 03:10:33.680]  he didn't take into effect that it was doctored the sleeves turned white didn't take into effect
[03:10:33.680 --> 03:10:39.200]  that genel lied on the stand by saying he had my shield and it tore my shoulder i had to have
[03:10:39.200 --> 03:10:44.720]  shoulder surgery i can't be a cop no more natasha nailed genel on the stand and said he does not
[03:10:44.720 --> 03:10:49.680]  have a hole in your show does he is it your shoulder strap genel just goes okay whatever
[03:10:49.680 --> 03:10:53.040]  i guess it was my shoulder strap and and the biggest thing is the footage that you have the
[03:10:53.040 --> 03:10:57.600]  raw footage first what they put in court of them glitching it out when it shows ray abs giving the
[03:10:57.600 --> 03:11:03.280]  orders for the breach all right we'll talk again soon thank you so much for the time gary mcbride

[03:12:28.880 --> 03:12:37.600]  and expert on the new world order takes over now. Welcome to the fourth hour this is your guest
[03:12:37.600 --> 03:12:42.800]  host jay dyer jays analysis thank you i wanted to talk about dialectics and understanding them
[03:12:42.800 --> 03:12:48.080]  the manipulation of dialectics you know we saw today or yesterday in the recent release of the
[03:12:48.080 --> 03:12:52.720]  newest batch of the twitter files that there's this collusion between NGOs between private
[03:12:52.720 --> 03:13:00.640]  self-appointed authorities between intelligence agencies so-called that are there to really
[03:13:00.640 --> 03:13:05.200]  shut down any critique any dissension and we knew that this was going on for a long time but now
[03:13:05.200 --> 03:13:11.200]  it's completely vindicated with these twitter files and i think that the key here is to understand
[03:13:11.200 --> 03:13:15.120]  that this control system isn't new and it's something that has existed for a long time and
[03:13:15.120 --> 03:13:19.280]  there's certain ways that the control system works that are so crucial to understand that we often
[03:13:19.280 --> 03:13:25.600]  forget and that is controlled opposition and controlled dialectics control dialectics is itself
[03:13:25.600 --> 03:13:32.320]  an older marxist idea that actually goes back to ancient greece and ancient pagan religions
[03:13:32.320 --> 03:13:37.520]  so you've heard me probably talk about uh uh plateaus republic right plateaus republic is about
[03:13:38.480 --> 03:13:43.040]  this idea of setting up the perfect utopian city state now i don't think in plateaus mind he thought
[03:13:43.040 --> 03:13:48.080]  he could really set up a utopian city state but he thought that you could try to shoot for that
[03:13:48.080 --> 03:13:55.600]  with a form of a mix of kind of authoritarianism with the philosopher king in the top a degree of
[03:13:55.600 --> 03:14:00.800]  kind of communitarianism or communism in the middle and then a large working base at the
[03:14:00.800 --> 03:14:06.880]  bottom of the pyramid and so there's a famous document uh from the cold war that that harkens
[03:14:06.880 --> 03:14:11.760]  back to this believe it or not that is kind of forgotten and it's a document that deals with
[03:14:11.760 --> 03:14:19.680]  an interrogation of a trotskyite marxist under the Stalinist regime under the nkvd so two branches
[03:14:19.680 --> 03:14:24.800]  of marxism that are kind of battling amongst themselves and there was a guy named christian
[03:14:24.800 --> 03:14:31.760]  rikofsky who was a bulgarian uh a socialist who was then eventually uh brought into um the high
[03:14:31.760 --> 03:14:37.680]  levels of the uh the the communist international to be a spokesperson so to speak at different
[03:14:37.680 --> 03:14:44.160]  levels and as as an ambassador to other countries and whatnot and he got arrested at one point
[03:14:44.160 --> 03:14:49.360]  and he's part of the trial of the 20 right there's these 20 figures underneath the stalin uh regime
[03:14:49.360 --> 03:14:54.080]  where stalin purged a bunch of the trotskyites and if you don't know there was these internal
[03:14:54.080 --> 03:14:59.440]  battles and struggles within the history of marxism communism socialism for who would be really the
[03:14:59.440 --> 03:15:04.640]  face of communism marx who would run this system who would be the power would it be the the so-called
[03:15:04.640 --> 03:15:09.840]  pure classical marxist the true marxist or would it be this new kind of stalinism which is very
[03:15:10.480 --> 03:15:16.880]  centralized in the sense of like a dictator and all that and uh stalin realized that the policies
[03:15:16.880 --> 03:15:21.280]  of the bolsheviks for example were pretty disastrous now stalin i think was a tyrant and a monster he
[03:15:21.280 --> 03:15:25.840]  was a terrible person but he realized that these really wild policies of the bolsheviks that we
[03:15:25.840 --> 03:15:30.640]  kind of see in today's antifa style stuff that it was totally destructive that it wouldn't work so he
[03:15:30.640 --> 03:15:37.600]  tried to scale back some of that and have just a total dictatorship and so uh as a result of this
[03:15:37.600 --> 03:15:42.960]  there was a lot of former marxists who were mad at him right there's a lot of trotskyites there's a
[03:15:42.960 --> 03:15:48.480]  lot of uh uh leniness and so forth uh mensheviks bolsheviks that were mad at stalin so they kind
[03:15:48.480 --> 03:15:52.720]  of went to war and then stalin purged them and there's a wild testimony from one of those guys
[03:15:52.720 --> 03:15:58.480]  that he that he interrogated no gonna worry this is the alex joneshaw i'm your host j dire i talk a
[03:15:58.480 --> 03:16:05.040]  lot about the great successes info wars has had i don't think anybody can deny it and it is because
[03:16:05.040 --> 03:16:09.680]  of listeners and viewers supporting us but when we talk about the crew at info wars people behind
[03:16:09.680 --> 03:16:16.800]  the scenes the researchers the writers they really have been the mvps in this fight and we look at
[03:16:16.800 --> 03:16:21.920]  harrison smith and the o-instroyer and the hard work they engage in every day five six seven days

[03:20:04.000 --> 03:20:17.680]  jones welcome back to the house show we're talking about the interrogation of the agent of trotsky
[03:20:17.680 --> 03:20:25.920]  the figure of rikovsky who was interrogated under the nkvd under Stalin and it's a it's
[03:20:25.920 --> 03:20:30.320]  a kind of a speculative text we don't know 100 percent if this is a totally accurate because
[03:20:30.320 --> 03:20:35.120]  of course it comes out of the period of the Stalinist regime but it is one piece of evidence
[03:20:35.120 --> 03:20:41.440]  that actually supports the the thesis of both quigley and and professor anthony satan that we've
[03:20:41.440 --> 03:20:47.600]  covered for so many years over here so the thesis deals with whether or not Marxism socialism
[03:20:47.600 --> 03:20:52.880]  is a real organic movement or whether it's kind of something propped up from the outside and the
[03:20:52.880 --> 03:20:56.880]  reason that i'm talking about this is that when we understand the dialectics of the cold war that
[03:20:56.880 --> 03:21:02.240]  manikin pitting of east against the west which was engineered at a higher level by very powerful
[03:21:02.240 --> 03:21:06.960]  western industrialist corporates and banking interests then we can begin to understand how
[03:21:06.960 --> 03:21:11.920]  the system that we live in today is a circle in which we're in a controlled back and forth kind
[03:21:11.920 --> 03:21:17.200]  of like a kind of like a pong match ping pong right and you're only allowed to discuss topics within
[03:21:17.200 --> 03:21:23.600]  this predefined circle and there's also a text that's pretty well known that's very closely
[03:21:23.600 --> 03:21:28.720]  related to this idea which is the book fire in the minds of men by james billington and in fire
[03:21:28.720 --> 03:21:34.400]  in the minds of men it's a it's a treatise on the history of french revolutionary marxist socialist
[03:21:34.400 --> 03:21:40.160]  ideas and he was not a conspiracy guy he was the librarian of congress so he was actually a scholar
[03:21:40.160 --> 03:21:45.520]  and he was a big supporter a big fan of this idea of the history of revolutionary thought from the
[03:21:45.520 --> 03:21:50.880]  french revolution up till today and then and sort of how it culminated up into the bolshevik
[03:21:50.880 --> 03:21:55.280]  revolution so he begins his book the french revolution then he ends it with the russian
[03:21:55.280 --> 03:22:01.920]  bolshevik revolution and then into the Stalinist period so revolution in this system is based on
[03:22:01.920 --> 03:22:09.200]  the idea of dialectics the idea that everything in life is a black and white yes no yin yang push
[03:22:09.200 --> 03:22:15.200]  pull situation and it's fundamental also to darwinism that the survival the fit is that this
[03:22:15.200 --> 03:22:20.640]  power struggle is something that is fundamental inherent to the existing order and that's itself
[03:22:20.640 --> 03:22:26.400]  what propels progress in this order how that's how we get to the higher stages and so it's called
[03:22:26.400 --> 03:22:33.200]  in this situation for example esoteric marxism right in the interrogation we have this discussion
[03:22:33.200 --> 03:22:37.600]  going on where the the figure of rikovsky is being interrogated by the nkvd and he says
[03:22:37.600 --> 03:22:44.640]  you guys don't really understand marxism marxism is much more than a economic system it's a lot more
[03:22:44.640 --> 03:22:51.280]  than some kind of theory about modes of production and who owns the means and modes of production
[03:22:51.280 --> 03:22:57.120]  he says it's not a primarily a social justice phenomenon this verbiage and this idea might
[03:22:57.120 --> 03:23:01.440]  have been used or attached to marxism over the years but that's not primarily what it's about
[03:23:01.440 --> 03:23:06.480]  he says and you guys have corrupted true marxism used all in us and he says that we will have the
[03:23:06.480 --> 03:23:11.440]  ultimate victory because we know the long game plan and this really takes the interrogator
[03:23:12.160 --> 03:23:17.440]  the guy named gabriel for a bit of a surprise is what do you mean you're going to win in the
[03:23:17.440 --> 03:23:21.600]  long run he says well because i know who's really running this he says who's really running it what
[03:23:21.600 --> 03:23:27.040]  do you mean he says well you have to understand what marxism is what socialism ultimately is he
[03:23:27.040 --> 03:23:34.000]  says it is not about fixing economic systems and injustices he says ultimately it's a kind of religion
[03:23:34.000 --> 03:23:37.680]  now he says it's not a religion the sense of we believe in you know supernatural powers
[03:23:38.480 --> 03:23:45.040]  but he says it's a religion that's at a commitment to a single idea which is revolutionary dialectic
[03:23:45.040 --> 03:23:52.320]  which is the end goal so there's not necessarily a utopia at the end right marx talked about the
[03:23:52.320 --> 03:23:55.600]  possibility that there could be a utopia or something like that in the withering way of the
[03:23:55.600 --> 03:24:01.920]  state but he says there's not really any guiding the necessary principle that we will
[03:24:01.920 --> 03:24:08.080]  necessarily get to a utopia it might end in a collapse it might end in chaos who knows but
[03:24:08.080 --> 03:24:14.080]  he says that our our commitment is to revolution and he says everything else serves revolution
[03:24:14.080 --> 03:24:18.640]  that's it so it's revolution even against revolution ultimately and he says and that's the
[03:24:18.640 --> 03:24:27.680]  great mystery and the acceptance within marxism of contradiction so a lot of us out here who are you
[03:24:27.680 --> 03:24:32.320]  online or whatever we get into discussions with family members whoever that are liberal or whatever
[03:24:32.320 --> 03:24:35.600]  that are committed to marxism now those are low-level marxists they don't really understand what this
[03:24:35.600 --> 03:24:44.640]  is about but they do kind of they unconsciously in in vibe this idea that the antithesis to the
[03:24:44.640 --> 03:24:52.960]  thesis thesis antithesis synthesis right is itself contradictory but necessary and so
[03:24:52.960 --> 03:24:57.760]  rikowski that's being interrogated says to the nkvd guy he says don't you understand that
[03:24:58.560 --> 03:25:05.200]  we couldn't have marxism socialism without the economic misery and chaos he says how would
[03:25:05.200 --> 03:25:10.720]  people turn to marxism if they didn't believe that the existing system was a huge injustice
[03:25:11.280 --> 03:25:15.280]  and the guy says okay well that's fair enough and sure that kind of makes sense and he says
[03:25:15.280 --> 03:25:21.040]  but i'm going to go even further because we believe that we must increase the chaos the
[03:25:21.040 --> 03:25:27.280]  collapse the destruction and he says we must do that especially on the working class because
[03:25:27.280 --> 03:25:31.760]  that's what furthers our movement and he says wait a minute so you're saying that you want
[03:25:31.760 --> 03:25:37.120]  worse situations for the workers he says absolutely because that's what drives them to
[03:25:37.120 --> 03:25:42.720]  revolutionary action and he says well okay maybe that makes sense i guess you could say that's a
[03:25:42.720 --> 03:25:47.840]  pragmatic goal here but i thought we were here to kind of fix the problems of the world and he
[03:25:47.840 --> 03:25:53.840]  says no no do you understand what he says what do you think revolution is and he says um i don't
[03:25:53.840 --> 03:25:57.920]  know it's it's guys on the ground that you know want to fight against injustice and he says
[03:25:57.920 --> 03:26:04.480]  who do you think funds those people and the nkvd guy says well i guess uh you know they
[03:26:04.480 --> 03:26:08.400]  raise money i don't know they get they get money from people who want to support them and agree
[03:26:08.400 --> 03:26:15.520]  with them he says no they get money from very powerful industrialists and banking houses
[03:26:15.520 --> 03:26:22.720]  that want to see the collapse that want to see the the the falling apart of the situation
[03:26:22.720 --> 03:26:28.560]  the strikes the hunger the starvation and the misery because that leads to the synthesis
[03:26:29.120 --> 03:26:34.800]  so everything in marxism is dialectical uh pieces versus antithesis and then you get the
[03:26:34.800 --> 03:26:40.560]  the synthesis out of that and so it's a technique it's a it's a method for producing the results
[03:26:40.560 --> 03:26:46.400]  one wants and you produce those results by intentionally causing the opposition to your
[03:26:46.400 --> 03:26:54.400]  position and that sounds so mysterious that's in marxism everywhere in fact marx as we know
[03:26:54.400 --> 03:26:59.600]  created his own secret society and he did that because the marxist before him back to the french
[03:26:59.600 --> 03:27:06.160]  revolution the rubs piers these kinds of figures the adam by shops right if you didn't know adam
[03:27:06.160 --> 03:27:14.640]  by shop was a communist and the idea here was we don't just have a secret society where we push
[03:27:14.640 --> 03:27:22.720]  this he says we also want to intentionally cause the reaction against us we want the reaction
[03:27:22.720 --> 03:27:27.120]  we want the opposition and we want to make things worse because that's what furthest revolution
[03:27:27.840 --> 03:27:32.560]  because that it is according to rikovsky and according to other people who've written on this
[03:27:32.560 --> 03:27:38.160]  like gary north a religion of revolution in fact the billington book is called the revolutionary
[03:27:38.160 --> 03:27:43.840]  faith it is faith in constant perpetual revolution and that's the one famous work i think if i
[03:27:43.840 --> 03:27:49.120]  recall from trotsky right perpetual permanent revolution so this it's an it's a never ending
[03:27:49.120 --> 03:27:54.080]  revolution every sit every generation of marxist even destroys the previous generation of marxist
[03:27:54.080 --> 03:27:59.920]  because that's the necessary logic of continual revolution now i'm not saying that today we're
[03:27:59.920 --> 03:28:08.480]  today we're run by marxist okay we're run by the fortune 100 etc who have adopted a synthesized view
[03:28:08.480 --> 03:28:13.520]  something closer to fabian socialism but we get an insight into in this interrogation back in the
[03:28:13.520 --> 03:28:23.760]  1930s or 20s or 30s whenever it was 19 1938 interrogation that uh that marxism was already
[03:28:23.760 --> 03:28:29.760]  beginning to be seen and understood as something that necessitated monopoly capital and when we
[03:28:29.760 --> 03:28:33.520]  come back we're gonna get into the interrogation where he actually says that monopoly capital is
[03:28:33.520 --> 03:28:39.520]  the necessary dialectical opposition to true marxism which furthers the revolution and it is
[03:28:39.520 --> 03:28:44.960]  in fact the capitalist the monopoly capitalist he says who will hand the victory over to us
[03:28:44.960 --> 03:28:50.320]  in the distant future quite literally he says that we we i know this because i know the people
[03:28:50.320 --> 03:28:54.240]  that are running marxism don't go anywhere anywhere this is a house johnson because it's jade

[03:33:00.640 --> 03:33:13.280]  lies of the new world order it's alex jones. Welcome back to the Alex Jones show i'm going to guess
[03:33:13.280 --> 03:33:19.680]  it's jay dyer jays analysis and so here we see that the contradictions that are evident within
[03:33:19.680 --> 03:33:26.080]  marxism are admitted by alleged high level marxist operatives now we know this was a high level
[03:33:26.080 --> 03:33:33.840]  socialist marxist guy but whether he was in on the inner inner party is the claim of rikovsky
[03:33:33.840 --> 03:33:40.320]  himself now the thing that's fascinating to me is that much of his claims are backed up by other
[03:33:40.320 --> 03:33:45.280]  independent researchers that are in the west right so we have quigley and sutton who quickly
[03:33:45.280 --> 03:33:51.680]  writing a course in tragedy and hope and in other writings as a defender of this model in this system
[03:33:51.680 --> 03:33:56.480]  and then we have sutton as somebody who was an economist who stumbled upon this information
[03:33:56.480 --> 03:34:04.160]  and became more of a critic the question is then whether this information is valid we can't ultimately
[03:34:04.160 --> 03:34:08.960]  know in terms of this interrogation because certainly anything that Stalin lets out is going to be
[03:34:10.000 --> 03:34:15.120]  probably amenable to the Stalinist regime or if the story is true that this kind of leaked who knows
[03:34:15.120 --> 03:34:21.920]  but rikovsky says that really marxism was run by an international inner clique of people who
[03:34:21.920 --> 03:34:28.480]  understood that revolution is a powerful tool for reorganizing and changing and restructuring
[03:34:28.480 --> 03:34:36.080]  society and he says that monopoly capitalism eventually saw that it needed marxism that it
[03:34:36.080 --> 03:34:43.920]  would be a good tool to have as a managed dialectic and so his interrogator then tv in kvd guy says
[03:34:43.920 --> 03:34:48.640]  what that's too crazy that's that's insane there's no way that it's that quote conspiratorial because
[03:34:49.440 --> 03:34:54.800]  why would capitalist fund their enemies and he says well they would fund enemies not just to
[03:34:54.800 --> 03:35:00.160]  control them but he says if you think about it what how is the whole modern world built
[03:35:00.160 --> 03:35:04.880]  and he says it's built on fiat money printing he says the whole federal reserve system right
[03:35:05.760 --> 03:35:10.320]  which is a creation of the millner baby and socialist clique that we've been lecturing through
[03:35:10.320 --> 03:35:16.240]  recently and the nkvds guy says yeah maybe that's the case and he says well don't you understand
[03:35:16.240 --> 03:35:22.160]  and don't you agree as a soviet person that uh international money is in your view a problem
[03:35:22.160 --> 03:35:26.320]  right and he says yeah sure that's what's uh running the world that's who funds tiny mustache man our
[03:35:26.320 --> 03:35:31.600]  enemy and the the the bourgeoisie nations in the west are the enemy of the soviet empire
[03:35:32.400 --> 03:35:38.800]  and he says you have it all wrong you have a very low level understanding he says the revolutionaries
[03:35:38.800 --> 03:35:43.520]  originally were the people who figured out how to do federal reserve style money printing
[03:35:44.480 --> 03:35:49.200]  he says what he says yeah i remember when i was asking you about who funds the marxists and the
[03:35:49.200 --> 03:35:54.960]  revolutionaries he says it's very wealthy people he says do you imagine that they're idiots or do
[03:35:54.960 --> 03:36:04.560]  you imagine that they are intelligent people he says they're not idiots they figured out how to
[03:36:04.560 --> 03:36:12.240]  game the whole world basically and how to achieve through money printing through fiat debt system
[03:36:12.960 --> 03:36:20.800]  and debt bubbles how to run the world and he says that that's the real purpose of marxism he says
[03:36:20.800 --> 03:36:26.800]  marxism has as its end goal the establishment of total domination total control by this inner
[03:36:26.800 --> 03:36:33.760]  clique that's it that's its end goal power it's not an end goal of setting up a truly just equitable
[03:36:33.760 --> 03:36:41.040]  you know social just fair system it is a system of control and he says that i can give you plenty
[03:36:41.040 --> 03:36:46.320]  examples to show this he says for example think about the three levers according to classical
[03:36:46.320 --> 03:36:52.800]  marxism of the revolution he says there's economics war and there's the workers the proletariat
[03:36:53.440 --> 03:36:59.360]  he says aren't aren't these the three basic levers and i think he says linens three levers
[03:36:59.360 --> 03:37:04.880]  or something like that and the nkbd guy says yeah sure that makes sense uh what about it he says well
[03:37:04.880 --> 03:37:11.120]  do you think that the workers control either of these three levers do the workers control economics
[03:37:11.120 --> 03:37:19.120]  do they do they control the printing and issuance of currency no he says do the nation states control
[03:37:19.120 --> 03:37:23.680]  the printing and issuance of currency and he says what happens anytime the nation state decides to
[03:37:23.680 --> 03:37:29.120]  start printing and issuing its own currency and not private international elites he says
[03:37:29.120 --> 03:37:35.040]  well uh that becomes a problem yeah exactly because this allows through inflation and
[03:37:35.040 --> 03:37:39.040]  through the running up of the month through the running of the money printer the money printer go
[03:37:39.040 --> 03:37:47.600]  burr right this allows them to buy up the real assets the real wealth and that confirms that
[03:37:47.600 --> 03:37:52.240]  that's in quickly strategy hope in the first 200 pages he says that this is the system that was
[03:37:52.240 --> 03:38:00.160]  set up post enlightenment based on fiat gold certificates golden gold notes you you print
[03:38:00.160 --> 03:38:05.760]  more gold notes than there is gold in the reserves right and that allows you to control and manipulate
[03:38:05.760 --> 03:38:10.880]  the currency you can control and you can expand and contract the amount of the currency that's out
[03:38:10.880 --> 03:38:19.600]  there inflation deflation etc and by doing that you can lend lend out right add extensive interest
[03:38:19.600 --> 03:38:25.280]  rates and it allows you eventually to control everything so he's he goes back to saying well
[03:38:25.280 --> 03:38:31.040]  look so do the workers control any of that no of course not he says okay so the workers don't
[03:38:31.040 --> 03:38:37.200]  control that private international economic industry elites control that he says number
[03:38:37.200 --> 03:38:44.400]  two is war he says do the proletariat control or begin wars no was it the political elite no
[03:38:44.400 --> 03:38:49.280]  no so even if it was the political elite to start a war where does the funding come from
[03:38:49.280 --> 03:38:55.680]  for a war doesn't it take a lot of money to have a war yeah exactly and then he says the workers
[03:38:55.680 --> 03:39:00.480]  he says so the proletariat don't control the the war machine and he says the workers themselves
[03:39:00.480 --> 03:39:07.760]  do the workers control the workers do they organize mass work strikes do they really
[03:39:07.760 --> 03:39:13.840]  control the unions maybe at one time a long time ago but not by the 30s and 40s that didn't control
[03:39:13.840 --> 03:39:20.240]  unions those were eventually bought up he says so this shows you that the three levers of revolution
[03:39:20.240 --> 03:39:26.160]  are actually run by very wealthy powerful people and he says that you can look at
[03:39:27.200 --> 03:39:32.720]  certain historical events like the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand he says basically by
[03:39:32.720 --> 03:39:38.320]  British intelligence and British intelligence using these people their Marxist assets and allies and
[03:39:38.320 --> 03:39:43.040]  various I know in that case it was the black hand but that was organized he says by these
[03:39:43.040 --> 03:39:48.160]  Fabian socialist elites in the UK to kick off World War one because they wanted war he says in fact
[03:39:48.160 --> 03:39:54.160]  war is revolutionary war is part of the revolutionary program and that's why Marxism has this history
[03:39:54.160 --> 03:40:01.280]  of sort of you know this symbology and imagery of red as in blood war right red is a is a
[03:40:01.280 --> 03:40:09.360]  Martian color Mars right and so red communism red Marxism is a war revolutionary based society or
[03:40:09.360 --> 03:40:16.640]  excuse me system and he says that ultimately this revolution is even destructive of many of those
[03:40:16.640 --> 03:40:21.440]  in our ranks he says if you look at the French revolution when the revolutionaries came to power
[03:40:21.440 --> 03:40:27.120]  the first thing they did was kill a bunch of the revolutionaries and he says this is always the case
[03:40:27.120 --> 03:40:33.760]  because they serve other ends and basically he says there's dupes dupes within the system of
[03:40:33.760 --> 03:40:39.680]  Marxism socialism serve the system because they think they're serving something to bring about
[03:40:39.680 --> 03:40:44.480]  social justice or whatever right the low level Marxist and even he says people in secret societies
[03:40:44.480 --> 03:40:51.360]  who were sort of roped into serving the socialist revolutions in the last you know a couple centuries
[03:40:51.360 --> 03:41:00.240]  he says they were some of the first people to be killed off he says Woodrow Wilson for example
[03:41:00.240 --> 03:41:06.560]  was utilized by Colonel Edwin Mandel House and some of our assets in order to help set up this
[03:41:06.560 --> 03:41:11.680]  federal reserve system which he says is revolutionary and this is what really blows the mind of his
[03:41:11.680 --> 03:41:18.240]  in KVD interrogator says you're telling me that the federal reserve style bank for national
[03:41:18.240 --> 03:41:22.960]  settlement style banking system is revolutionary he says isn't that what we're fighting
[03:41:22.960 --> 03:41:30.240]  and Rokovsky says no it is the revolution because that was a revolution against
[03:41:31.680 --> 03:41:36.000]  nation states and against people printing their own money having their own currency
[03:41:37.760 --> 03:41:42.960]  and he says and that's why we had to for example get rid of certain countries that were that didn't
[03:41:42.960 --> 03:41:48.240]  have this model he says the fall of the czar for example was key he says the establishment
[03:41:48.240 --> 03:41:53.760]  of federal reserve banks in other countries was key and he says we even utilize a lot of the
[03:41:53.760 --> 03:42:01.360]  masonic societies just as our tools to bring about revolution especially during the 1800s
[03:42:01.360 --> 03:42:08.960]  and in the 1900s and so he says that this whole model of nationalism has to be done away with
[03:42:09.840 --> 03:42:15.200]  and he says that that's because the true model here of internationalism is really just a program
[03:42:15.200 --> 03:42:21.680]  to level consolidate wealth and transfer it all short and that's exactly what Sutton and Quigley
[03:42:21.680 --> 03:42:28.400]  say and this is the dialectic that I've been speaking of that's presently the system that we
[03:42:28.400 --> 03:42:35.760]  live in not primarily classical Marxism but a system that is big capital fortune 100 etc
[03:42:35.760 --> 03:42:43.520]  that utilizes these principles to control people within a managed dialectic and you can't step
[03:42:43.520 --> 03:42:48.800]  out of the controlled fake left right or the controlled conservative versus liberal dialect
[03:42:48.800 --> 03:42:53.760]  dialectic because it's they set the parameters of what's allowed don't go anywhere this is the

[03:47:12.600 --> 03:47:16.600]  welcome back to the
[03:47:16.600 --> 03:47:20.600]  time of play-doh you've heard my play-doh lectures and if you go to
[03:47:20.600 --> 03:47:27.600]  my website or my youtube channel you can find them on play-doh lectures you can also go to band up video and if you search my name you'll find the last two years
[03:47:27.600 --> 03:47:33.600]  of all the information and lectures that I've done in the last two years over there been a video
[03:47:33.600 --> 03:47:42.600]  we've covered in a play-doh republic in depth and play-doh said that the way the system needs to work is that you have basically an inner secret society
[03:47:42.600 --> 03:47:48.600]  that publicly lies and publicly gives out disinformation and false stories
[03:47:48.600 --> 03:47:56.600]  what he called the noble lie amongst other lies and he says that this is the best way to control the system
[03:47:56.600 --> 03:48:05.600]  and it has to be run this way because that's just the nature of the beast he says and so the Marxists and the socialists when they were forming their early communities
[03:48:05.600 --> 03:48:12.600]  in the time of the French Revolution who by the way they got support even at that time from very wealthy powerful elites including even the aristocracy and the bourgeoisie
[03:48:12.600 --> 03:48:20.600]  they supported a lot of these revolutionary movements even at that time they consciously adopted the Pythagorean and
[03:48:20.600 --> 03:48:29.600]  Platonic secret society model saying that they would have to hide their designs because their designs are so revolutionary, so wild
[03:48:29.600 --> 03:48:34.600]  against the existing order that they would be completely and immediately shut down if they were discovered
[03:48:34.600 --> 03:48:46.600]  and of course some of those designs have been discovered that's how we know about Adam Byshop's Jacob and Illuminus conspiracies because those plans were eventually discovered
[03:48:46.600 --> 03:48:58.600]  but the same idea which is a radical feminism, a radical liberty equality fraternity doctrine of the Jacob and socialist Marxists continued on in various secret societies
[03:48:58.600 --> 03:49:07.600]  and we see it pop back up with Marx, we see it pop back up with people like Giuseppe Mazini, we see it pop back up with people like Antonio Gramsci
[03:49:07.600 --> 03:49:19.600]  but those are just sort of the public faces and pushers of Marxism and socialism and they are conspirators and they are involved in a lot of secret societies and machinations and intrigues
[03:49:19.600 --> 03:49:30.600]  but they're not the ones really hoisting the system upon the whole world and that's the key revolution here, the key idea to understand about revolution is that it's not primarily those people on the ground
[03:49:30.600 --> 03:49:41.600]  it's people like David Rockefeller who says in his memoirs that he was so happy to go into communist China right before, I think right before Nixon did, right around that time
[03:49:41.600 --> 03:49:47.600]  he said because that allowed Chase Bank to be the only in the first bank in communist China
[03:49:47.600 --> 03:49:56.600]  and in 1979 he writes an essay for the New York Times from a China travel explaining how he was so glad to see the success of that revolution
[03:49:56.600 --> 03:50:02.600]  and how Maoism is an amazing and excellent experiment for the future of humanity.
[03:50:02.600 --> 03:50:05.600]  That's just one example amongst many.
[03:50:05.600 --> 03:50:14.600]  American Industrial Corporation is another example that funded the Bolsheviks and gave them money. USAID was used to funnel money to the Bolsheviks and to Trotsky.
[03:50:14.600 --> 03:50:23.600]  Trotsky was especially the one that got most of the money and it was in fact Trotsky according to Rikovsky who was the real star of the early revolution.
[03:50:23.600 --> 03:50:36.600]  Even Lenin was kind of upstate or not the real ideal that they wanted and then Stalin arose as the sort of chief or henchmen to Lenin and then he came to power
[03:50:36.600 --> 03:50:43.600]  and that's why he had to get rid of Trotsky is because apparently Stalin found out that Marxism was already under the control of this
[03:50:43.600 --> 03:50:47.600]  and so he thought well I'll just run this thing and I'll make myself the dictator.
[03:50:47.600 --> 03:50:54.600]  And we've seen that in so many cases of tyrants, puppets, dictators who've been supported by the West.
[03:50:54.600 --> 03:51:01.600]  We think of Noriega, we think of Bin Laden, we think of Gaddafi, right?
[03:51:01.600 --> 03:51:05.600]  You get supported by the West and then eventually you get tossed aside, you're no longer needed.
[03:51:05.600 --> 03:51:09.600]  And that might be because you've expired, you've run your course, they don't need you anymore.
[03:51:09.600 --> 03:51:12.600]  It could be because you are not doing everything you're supposed to do.
[03:51:12.600 --> 03:51:16.600]  There could be many reasons why you're dispensed with.
[03:51:16.600 --> 03:51:23.600]  But that dispensing is something that's key to the history of revolutions who are funded by the wealthiest people out there.
[03:51:23.600 --> 03:51:27.600]  And so this is just really blowing the mind of the NKVD interrogator.
[03:51:27.600 --> 03:51:29.600]  He just can't understand this.
[03:51:29.600 --> 03:51:32.600]  He senses though that it seems to be consistent.
[03:51:32.600 --> 03:51:38.600]  It actually makes sense but he says that it's just really hard to believe that, you know, people, nobody's really understood.
[03:51:38.600 --> 03:51:40.600]  He's like, oh, it's not nobody.
[03:51:40.600 --> 03:51:51.600]  Listen, that hasn't understood, he says a lot of people have understood this and he says that when they do understand it, he says that that's when it's time to, for example, if they're a dictator or a leader that understands it, that's when it's time to dispense with them.
[03:51:51.600 --> 03:52:00.600]  He says, for example, the people that I serve, he says these industrialists and these banking elites, he says they are set up and promoted Hitler.
[03:52:00.600 --> 03:52:03.600]  And the NKVD guy says, what?
[03:52:03.600 --> 03:52:04.600]  Why would they promote that guy?
[03:52:04.600 --> 03:52:07.600]  That's who we're fighting against in the Soviet Union.
[03:52:07.600 --> 03:52:10.600]  And he says they want the war.
[03:52:10.600 --> 03:52:20.600]  They want the war against the Soviet Union because ultimately this war exhausts all of these powers and only hands more power to this elite.
[03:52:20.600 --> 03:52:25.600]  And he says that we must have our dialectical opponent, tiny mustache man, Hitler.
[03:52:25.600 --> 03:52:27.600]  Hitler must be supported.
[03:52:27.600 --> 03:52:38.600]  If you read Quigley, I think it's page 1059 and Trajan Hope, he says that Alan Dulles used to work for the Schroder Bank, which is the bank that funded Hitler's rise.
[03:52:38.600 --> 03:52:42.600]  Schroder Bank with the Bank of England funded the rise of Hitler.
[03:52:42.600 --> 03:52:45.600]  Trajan Hope page 1059.
[03:52:45.600 --> 03:52:47.600]  And that's exactly what Rikowski says.
[03:52:47.600 --> 03:53:03.600]  Now, he doesn't say Schroder Bank, but he just says that the same people behind internationalism are the same people behind tiny mustache man and your revolution ultimately.
[03:53:03.600 --> 03:53:11.600]  And so some people theorize, again, we don't know this is true, it's a lot of speculation, but some people theorize and actually in Trajan Hope Quigley says that this is what actually kicks off the Cold War,
[03:53:11.600 --> 03:53:20.600]  is that Stalin didn't want the Marshall Plan aid because he thought perhaps that this was an attempt to control and manipulate him.
[03:53:20.600 --> 03:53:27.600]  Now, he was helped and propped up as well, right, from the West and we know that from Sutton's work also.
[03:53:27.600 --> 03:53:36.600]  But one of the reasons for the Cold War, even according to Quigley, was that there was this struggle for control of international socialism.
[03:53:36.600 --> 03:53:49.600]  Would it be the Trotsky-Lenin types or would it be the Soviet style Russian national socialism or what he calls national communism, right?
[03:53:49.600 --> 03:53:57.600]  He says the only difference between Hitler and Stalin is that Hitler's national socialism and Stalin was national communism.
[03:53:57.600 --> 03:54:02.600]  But they're both essentially control systems that are exported to by the West.
[03:54:02.600 --> 03:54:13.600]  And he says that it doesn't matter to us because he says we can have these systems bump up against each other and go to war because that only benefits the revolution.
[03:54:13.600 --> 03:54:16.600]  He says the war is revolutionary.
[03:54:16.600 --> 03:54:29.600]  And so he says that if you understand this, you understand it all because you understand that the elite need their opposition and they need it to go to war
[03:54:29.600 --> 03:54:36.600]  because that's the best way to fund and promote their ultimate designs, which are total control.
[03:54:36.600 --> 03:54:38.600]  And war is also a great way to make money.
[03:54:38.600 --> 03:54:45.600]  And he says that did you imagine that the people that run the planet don't know how to make money?
[03:54:45.600 --> 03:54:58.600]  He said do you imagine the people that know, that just figured out all of this, that they don't know how to steer and manipulate coups and revolutions and fascism and socialism and democracy and all this kind of stuff?
[03:54:58.600 --> 03:55:03.600]  He says all of these systems will ultimately die, even the secret society system.
[03:55:03.600 --> 03:55:06.600]  He says because it will give way to our end goal.
[03:55:06.600 --> 03:55:11.600]  And he doesn't exactly say what the end goal is other than he says things like total control, right?
[03:55:11.600 --> 03:55:15.600]  And that's essentially where we are now, which is the technocratic era.
[03:55:15.600 --> 03:55:26.600]  And I was thinking as I was reading this that, you know, he locates the essence of the power in the system, not in media or in government, but in the money printing.
[03:55:26.600 --> 03:55:34.600]  And if we think about what's going on right now in cryptocurrency, for example, in my view, Bitcoin is the superior form of money.
[03:55:34.600 --> 03:55:35.600]  It is ethical money.
[03:55:35.600 --> 03:55:39.600]  It actually, if you think about it, solves a lot of these problems.
[03:55:39.600 --> 03:55:41.600]  Now, there's nothing that's absolutely perfect in the world.
[03:55:41.600 --> 03:55:43.600]  And it's very early in terms of Bitcoin.
[03:55:43.600 --> 03:55:46.600]  So Bitcoin is volatile because it's in that early phase.
[03:55:46.600 --> 03:55:51.600]  But a lot of things that are new, if you look at the early phases of Amazon stock, it was very volatile.
[03:55:51.600 --> 03:55:56.600]  It collapses before it rose to, you know, high levels of prominence.
[03:55:56.600 --> 03:56:02.600]  But you'll notice that whether it's Hillary or whether it's Bill Gates or whether they all talk about how they don't like Bitcoin.
[03:56:02.600 --> 03:56:08.600]  If you look at Klaus and World Economic Forum, he says, oh, I like the things like the Cardano.
[03:56:08.600 --> 03:56:10.600]  I like the things like the Solana.
[03:56:10.600 --> 03:56:12.600]  We like the things like the Assyrium.
[03:56:12.600 --> 03:56:14.600]  Because those are all centralized things.
[03:56:14.600 --> 03:56:18.600]  And the difference with Bitcoin is that it's not centralized as decentralized.
[03:56:18.600 --> 03:56:22.600]  And it's based on math, you can't inflate it.
[03:56:22.600 --> 03:56:24.600]  It has a limited supply.
[03:56:24.600 --> 03:56:30.600]  Only 21 million ever will be printed or minted or mined, you should say.
[03:56:30.600 --> 03:56:33.600]  Printed or minted in the sense of comparing it to the older system.
[03:56:33.600 --> 03:56:39.600]  So, I mean, doesn't that kind of show that if you understand that,
[03:56:39.600 --> 03:56:43.600]  and if you go listen to the lectures and the talks of Michael Saylor, for example,
[03:56:43.600 --> 03:56:50.600]  who's a microstrategies CEO who really invested everything he had and even took out loans to go into Bitcoin so heavily.
[03:56:50.600 --> 03:56:52.600]  Billions of dollars into Bitcoin.
[03:56:52.600 --> 03:57:00.600]  You know, he goes into the depths of discussing this, explaining how this system of energy storage,
[03:57:00.600 --> 03:57:04.600]  money is really just a way to store energy over time.
[03:57:04.600 --> 03:57:11.600]  He says that that's the great innovation of Bitcoin is that it solves and it goes against what this system represents.
[03:57:11.600 --> 03:57:17.600]  This system represents a manipulation and control mechanism where a centralized private elite group
[03:57:17.600 --> 03:57:21.600]  can inflate or deflate or destroy your currency at will.
[03:57:21.600 --> 03:57:26.600]  And he says that Bitcoin represents an international math-based system that can't be inflated or destroyed at will,
[03:57:26.600 --> 03:57:29.600]  because it's decentralized. It's very opposite.
[03:57:29.600 --> 03:57:31.600]  So, that's ethical. That's just.
[03:57:31.600 --> 03:57:33.600]  This system is not ethical, not just.
[03:57:33.600 --> 03:57:38.600]  And the high-level Marxist themselves say that it is intended to destroy
[03:57:38.600 --> 03:57:43.600]  because the destruction of economics is what leads to the technocratic socialist in-game.
[03:57:43.600 --> 03:58:08.600]  This is The Oxygen Show.

[03:58:47.600 --> 03:58:51.600]  Thousands of former Nazis went to work for the United States government.
[03:58:51.600 --> 03:58:55.600]  Applying this has been found and is now in the possession of the Army.
[03:58:55.600 --> 03:58:59.600]  There is a bulletin from CBS News. President Kennedy has been shot.
[03:58:59.600 --> 03:59:03.600]  This is a different kind of war.
[03:59:03.600 --> 03:59:07.600]  The USS Liberty had just been attacked by Israeli jets and torpedo boats,
[03:59:07.600 --> 03:59:11.600]  the CIA that manipulate the news in the United States.
[03:59:11.600 --> 03:59:15.600]  They took the babies out of 80 bears and left the children to die on the cold floor.
[03:59:15.600 --> 03:59:19.600]  It was almost as if there were a plan in motion to get your tank hit.
[03:59:19.600 --> 03:59:22.600]  We need you to go into the capital!
[03:59:22.600 --> 03:59:25.600]  You will always have conspiracy theories.
[03:59:25.600 --> 03:59:27.600]  They are nothing but distract.
[03:59:27.600 --> 03:59:31.600]  You guys censored Harvard-educated doctors who silenced those voices.
[03:59:31.600 --> 03:59:35.600]  What we want to do in Davos is to reset that.
[03:59:35.600 --> 03:59:38.600]  As soon as we start exposing the Great Reset,
[03:59:38.600 --> 04:00:03.600]  let's do this! These globalists are going to prison!
