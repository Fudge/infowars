[00:00.000 --> 00:24.480]  From the Infowars.com News Center, deep behind enemy lines in occupied Texas, broadcasting
[00:24.480 --> 00:30.480]  worldwide, you're listening to the voice of human resistance against the Technotronic
[00:30.480 --> 00:36.080]  Technocracy Tank Cooper. You're listening to Alex Jones.
[00:36.080 --> 00:58.640]  It's Wednesday, the 28th day of September, 2016. I'm your host Alex Jones and in just
[00:58.640 --> 01:03.840]  three short days the internet will be handed over by the United States that built it in
[01:03.840 --> 01:11.840]  conjunction with the UK. It will be handed over the control, the address registries,
[01:11.840 --> 01:20.480]  the domain DNS's will be handed over to a global UN run consortium.
[01:22.240 --> 01:31.200]  Our election this year will be overseen by the OECD's intelligence body.
[01:31.200 --> 01:40.960]  The OECD is the corporation that began the European Union. It is the European
[01:40.960 --> 01:43.200]  Robber Barons, the actual corporation.
[01:47.680 --> 01:52.560]  And Obama comes out last week and says we need to surrender control of US sovereignty to the UN,
[01:52.560 --> 01:56.640]  that we should cue that clip back up because I don't come up with themes for the show.
[01:56.640 --> 02:02.240]  What's happening creates the theme. I have a stack of mainstream news here
[02:03.360 --> 02:08.400]  where the United Nations is going after Sheriff Opio, where the United Nations is going after the
[02:08.400 --> 02:17.120]  Texas state government, where in the Washington Post, the mouth of Surin, USO's black people
[02:17.760 --> 02:25.200]  reparations for the history of racial terrorism says UN panel. Now understand the human rights
[02:25.200 --> 02:34.480]  panel of the UN is run by Saudi Arabia and Qatar that still say that black people aren't humans
[02:34.480 --> 02:41.840]  and have them basically as slaves in many areas. I mean you cannot make this up. This is an outside
[02:41.840 --> 02:47.440]  global power, just like the George Soros emails say, using racial and cultural and religious
[02:47.440 --> 02:51.840]  differences to play us off against each other and you can see how they plan to bring down the US,
[02:51.840 --> 02:56.160]  get us all to say we're kumbaya, bring in political correctness, then hype up massive
[02:56.160 --> 03:02.080]  racist behavior by so-called minorities, force feed it in schools, and then have a global system
[03:02.080 --> 03:08.160]  where it's managed and where the UN represents the third world populations that are then brought
[03:08.160 --> 03:14.640]  into the first world for colonial reparations carried out by the very robber barons and royalty
[03:14.640 --> 03:21.040]  engaging in the reverse colonialism of the West right now, playing different sides off against
[03:21.040 --> 03:29.520]  each other. This is the equation that you were just given. It is unbelievable. We've got the
[03:29.520 --> 03:34.880]  smart cities initiative to bring our internet under UN control. We have the strong cities to
[03:34.880 --> 03:40.080]  bring our local police under UN control. You cannot make it up. They're announcing it.
[03:41.040 --> 03:47.760]  So do I get a Pulitzer Prize for breaking all this 20 years ago? No. I'm even more kooky. I'm
[03:47.760 --> 03:52.400]  even more dark-hearted. I'm even more dangerous according to Hillary and according to her VP
[03:52.400 --> 04:00.720]  candidate, Tim Cain. I've got to be shut down. I don't have a right to exist. Now I want to explain
[04:00.720 --> 04:06.320]  something. Michael Savage has 20 million listeners a week. He came on the show twice in the last month
[04:07.360 --> 04:12.320]  and they manipulated him. They cut him off WABC, let him know he was being taunted. Then they began
[04:12.320 --> 04:16.880]  cutting him off as 400 affiliates. They could have just flipped the satellite off, but they did it
[04:16.880 --> 04:21.440]  over an hour as people called in saying you're slowly being turned off at the station level
[04:22.080 --> 04:27.040]  to drive him into a fit. Now I've got his home number and his cell number. He's not been answering.
[04:27.600 --> 04:31.360]  I talked to his producer yesterday and he said, well, we're just trying to figure out what's
[04:31.360 --> 04:35.760]  going on. CBS won't even tell us. You'll hear something soon, but this is a bellweather for
[04:35.760 --> 04:41.360]  everybody. He told me last week during the break that he might not be on the air soon because
[04:41.360 --> 04:46.960]  he was being censored more and more by CBS. So let's understand that. Michael Savage told me that
[04:46.960 --> 04:51.360]  last week in front of my producers on Skype during the break, talking to him right here in this
[04:51.360 --> 04:57.360]  chair. So this affects everybody. They just took over Fox News and I told you two months ago,
[04:57.360 --> 05:03.280]  get ready for talk radio next. If you want to know how Huma Abidine, the top aide to Hillary
[05:03.280 --> 05:08.560]  Clinton really feels about Sharia law, look no further than her father, a video surfaced of
[05:08.560 --> 05:13.360]  Said Abidine outlining his view of Sharia law and how the Western world has turned Muslims
[05:13.360 --> 05:19.920]  hostile. The video was recorded in 1971 and titled the world of Islam. Said Abidine indicates that
[05:19.920 --> 05:25.040]  any culture change will have to be validated by the tenants of Islam. The video provides a window
[05:25.040 --> 05:29.280]  into the Abidine's family ideology, which has been examined for its connection with the Muslim
[05:29.280 --> 05:34.720]  brotherhood. The Abidine family are responsible for creating the Journal of Muslim Minority Affairs,
[05:34.720 --> 05:40.320]  of which Huma Abidine lists herself as the assistant editor of for 12 years. The publication is
[05:40.320 --> 05:45.760]  accused of having ties to the Muslim brotherhood and for promoting a hard line Islamic ideological
[05:45.760 --> 05:50.480]  stance. She's also had a hand in the work of the Institute of Muslim Minority Affairs,
[05:50.480 --> 05:56.560]  a think tank established in Saudi Arabia. It's been accused that a financier of Al Qaeda funded it.

[08:07.360 --> 08:14.560]  Wednesday, September 28th, 2016, marks only 40 days in the countdown to the general election.
[08:14.560 --> 08:17.760]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[08:21.440 --> 08:27.520]  40 days out, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you so much for joining us. On this Wednesday, the 28th
[08:27.520 --> 08:35.280]  day of September 2016, we have several very informative guests joining us. One of them
[08:35.280 --> 08:40.320]  is Mr. Crowder. I'll have it louder with Crowder. Always informative and interesting.
[08:40.320 --> 08:45.040]  Stephen Crowder from lottowithcrowder.com will be joining us. Dr. Ed Grubs is going to be joining us
[08:45.040 --> 08:51.200]  talking about this story, exclusive Time Magazine. And then I went and looked and the news had
[08:51.200 --> 08:54.480]  actually broken three days ago and the new scientists, but whatever. I just love how time
[08:54.480 --> 09:04.640]  lies incessantly. A world's first baby born with new three-parent technique. And of course,
[09:04.640 --> 09:08.720]  the story that really broke was nine months ago that the woman was pregnant and then a few days
[09:08.720 --> 09:13.120]  ago that the woman was going into labor. But yes, I guess it is exclusive that the baby's been born.
[09:13.120 --> 09:17.280]  And I don't want to go off the reservation. And the point is there were hundreds of articles
[09:17.280 --> 09:22.240]  that broke before Time Magazine said this and none of them said exclusive. It's just ridiculous how
[09:22.240 --> 09:27.840]  they always spin and deceive at every level. And they sell it like it's this wonderful new thing.
[09:28.560 --> 09:33.120]  We're going to be talking about that a lot more today. Also, there's pretty exclusive
[09:33.120 --> 09:40.320]  video. It's not exclusive. Everybody's got it. Thank God. And that's did Hillary Clinton give
[09:40.320 --> 09:45.040]  hand signals to debate moderator Lester Holt. You watch the seven and a half minute video
[09:45.040 --> 09:50.560]  up on m4wars.com. It's very conclusive. It's like somebody in a poker game,
[09:50.560 --> 09:55.920]  clearly giving signals. And then every time she would do it, he would continue with the topic
[09:55.920 --> 10:00.640]  if it was on one side of her nose. The other side of her nose, he would then immediately interrupt
[10:00.640 --> 10:07.840]  Donald Trump 40 plus times her only six times. So this is just ridiculous. I mean, she might
[10:07.840 --> 10:11.920]  as well been sending smoke signals up or something or sending him text messages.
[10:13.200 --> 10:18.400]  So absolutely rigged. It blew up in their face. I think Trump should have been more aggressive.
[10:18.400 --> 10:22.960]  He says he will be in the next debate. I think he knows that he could have done a better job.
[10:22.960 --> 10:28.080]  But it doesn't matter. They totally rigged the thing. And so they lose. And that's what the
[10:28.080 --> 10:36.240]  poll numbers are showing. So they can't win for losing. That's coming up. We have got so much
[10:36.240 --> 10:42.160]  to get into on the continued persecution of anyone that actually tries to bring jobs to the United
[10:42.160 --> 10:47.120]  States. The weaponized government continues. US Department of Labor targets Peter Thiel.
[10:48.720 --> 10:52.320]  And again, he attends Bilderberg group, but he does a lot of good things, though.
[10:52.320 --> 10:59.440]  I think Jerry's out on one of the founders of obviously PayPal, Facebook, you name it. But
[10:59.440 --> 11:04.800]  Peter Thiel's startup sued by Department of Labor for discrimination saying he doesn't hire enough
[11:04.800 --> 11:11.680]  Asians. Yes, Asians are being discriminated against in high tech. And I guess in PhDs and I guess in
[11:11.680 --> 11:18.320]  doctorates, even though Asians have the highest percentage in that and are the richest people
[11:18.320 --> 11:25.600]  basically in this country in the wide aggregate. But oh, the white people are out to get them,
[11:25.600 --> 11:31.600]  you see, ladies and gentlemen, those evil, evil, evil white people. And this is all because they're
[11:31.600 --> 11:36.320]  angry because he came out, you know, he's being gay at the RNC and Donald Trump said it's time to
[11:36.320 --> 11:42.000]  have a big tent and be inclusive. And it was a huge coup against Hillary. And they're totally upset.
[11:42.000 --> 11:45.440]  And so they're trying to destroy his company. That's just how they operate.
[11:45.440 --> 11:50.480]  It's what they do. Also, on the economic front, China debt could wreck the global economy, leading
[11:50.480 --> 11:56.080]  economists warns country could suffer a calamitous slowdown. And I think that slowdown's already
[11:56.080 --> 12:03.360]  clearly happening. That's one of the big triggers we're looking at. Now, before I get into all of
[12:03.360 --> 12:11.920]  the massive amounts of critical news that we have today, I want to just lay a marker down here that
[12:11.920 --> 12:19.520]  this issue that I'm about to break down is undoubtedly the most central issue facing every
[12:19.520 --> 12:25.280]  man, woman and child on this club right now. Global private corporate governance is now
[12:27.760 --> 12:33.920]  standing on its own two feet. It's gone from being embryonic to being a baby to crawling
[12:33.920 --> 12:45.840]  to standing to walking. It's now running. It's now a young man. It's now basically ready to start its
[12:45.840 --> 12:55.840]  life as an adult as an operating system, not as beta, but as 1.0. As I said back on September 1st,
[12:55.840 --> 13:03.600]  everything locked in place. It was very clear. Their entire program accelerated 200 percent
[13:06.080 --> 13:12.080]  the week before and that first week. All hell broke loose. Their programs launched. You could
[13:12.080 --> 13:16.480]  see the integration, whether it was Apple or whether it was Facebook or whether it was Google
[13:16.480 --> 13:22.560]  or whether it was Bing. You could see it on the Microsoft platforms everywhere. The new look came
[13:22.560 --> 13:29.840]  in. The new notifications, the new style, the new operating systems, the new upgrade, it all went
[13:29.840 --> 13:38.160]  into place. Unified continuity of agenda. Very, very, very chilling. And the UN came out suddenly
[13:38.160 --> 13:44.720]  all over multinational news, all over our news and said, the UN is going to run your borders.
[13:44.720 --> 13:48.960]  The UN is running the immigration program for the US and Europe. The UN is going to go after
[13:48.960 --> 13:52.800]  right wing extremists. The UN is going to take over the internet. They've always denied it.
[13:52.800 --> 13:57.440]  They said it was just a multinational transfer, but we still have control. Oh, now they, oh,
[13:58.080 --> 14:02.800]  admit the New York Times. Yes, the UN is taking over. Thank God. Hurry up and censor these right
[14:02.800 --> 14:07.920]  wingers. And massive censorship intensified in Europe. And civil emergencies were declared. And
[14:07.920 --> 14:13.520]  radical Islamists were brought in. And UN TV ads air in Sweden, France and Germany saying,
[14:13.520 --> 14:20.160]  it's good to not be German. Blonde hair is bad. It's racist. German families are bad. You need
[14:20.160 --> 14:26.960]  to wear the hijab. You need to marry a Muslim man. I mean, I've aired the TV ads. I've shown you the
[14:26.960 --> 14:32.160]  parenting magazines. I mean, this isn't some little French cook group doing this. This is UNESCO,
[14:32.160 --> 14:37.440]  the United Nations Educational and Cultural Organization, which our universities, our high
[14:37.440 --> 14:43.120]  schools, everything is standardized and set to their regulations. The federal regulations
[14:43.120 --> 14:49.840]  are written to meet that, not our laws, but what the UN says. They launched in the last six months
[14:49.840 --> 14:56.400]  strong cities, admitted takeover of our local governments by the United Nations enforced by
[14:56.400 --> 15:01.040]  the Justice Department. Obama administration and UN announced global police force to fight extremism
[15:01.040 --> 15:10.080]  in the US. Today in the news, US owes black people reparations for a history of racial
[15:10.080 --> 15:17.760]  terrorism says UN panel. The UN all over Africa to create carbon offsets will go in with troops.
[15:17.760 --> 15:22.800]  This has been even the New York Times and kill whole villages, sometimes thousands in a week,
[15:23.360 --> 15:28.480]  to take them off their ancestral lands and quote, set it aside for a carbon sink when
[15:28.480 --> 15:34.000]  multinational corporations go in and want to take the property. But they're going to tell Europe
[15:34.000 --> 15:38.480]  and the United States, and by the way, the UK ended slavery pretty much worldwide,
[15:38.480 --> 15:44.880]  except for in the Middle East, that we owe reparations and that we ancestrally owe other
[15:44.880 --> 15:49.520]  people money. That's like if your dad's a murderer and then you go to prison for it.
[15:49.520 --> 15:53.360]  Well, how about your great great grandfather or great great great great great great grandfather
[15:53.360 --> 16:00.240]  going back to slavery. Now it's the UN saying you will pay reparations manipulating internal
[16:00.240 --> 16:05.680]  groups within our nation with Soros, with Hillary, with the Justice Department coming in
[16:05.680 --> 16:11.600]  to manage the local police departments under UN control. This is the Washington Post today.
[16:12.720 --> 16:17.520]  Stop on info wars.com. There is an entire section on drugs report.com
[16:19.360 --> 16:26.560]  that breaks all of this down. This is happening. This is unfolding. This is real. Now I want to be
[16:26.560 --> 16:34.400]  clear. When October 1st comes around in three days, okay, they're going to have TV shows and
[16:34.400 --> 16:39.520]  they're going to have newspapers say crazy people in Congress and crazy people online
[16:39.520 --> 16:43.280]  thought the UN would end the internet. Look, the internet's still here today, birds are tweeting,
[16:43.280 --> 16:47.840]  the sun's out. We never said that. We said the regulation and the control is going in
[16:48.640 --> 16:52.240]  and that they're going to phase all this control in and that they're going to announce more and
[16:52.240 --> 16:56.400]  more UN control in the months and years to come and you see it all happening.
[16:58.160 --> 17:02.560]  Now two or three years total UN takeover. That seems like a long time. That's a flash.
[17:02.560 --> 17:06.560]  Now let's go to this report with Michael Savage being taken off the air
[17:07.600 --> 17:11.920]  and how this affects everyone. It's part of a global government takeover. Here it is.
[17:14.000 --> 17:20.720]  Those who stay, cross over the line. We're back on the air. Apparently there was a glitch.
[17:21.280 --> 17:26.160]  We think there was a technical glitch. I kind of doubt it. So if you want to know if there's
[17:26.160 --> 17:31.920]  media bias tonight, you don't have to look any further than this show. 100 million viewers out
[17:31.920 --> 17:41.760]  of the eve of the most important debate in history, they take off a man like me. Not so much as an
[17:41.760 --> 17:47.440]  email to my producer before the show. Did my syndicator send a note saying they were preempting
[17:47.440 --> 17:53.200]  me today. So the only reason they preempted me is to prevent me from talking about Hillary Clinton
[17:53.200 --> 17:57.680]  and Donald Trump in my estimation. And I'm going to make a statement right now. If they do this to
[17:57.680 --> 18:02.240]  me again tomorrow, and they did it to me by the way without any notice, make a note of this because
[18:02.240 --> 18:07.040]  you may not hear me tomorrow or ever again. I want you to understand the kind of duress I'm under.
[18:07.680 --> 18:13.120]  This is sabotage. Do you understand what sabotage is? Those of you who are listening,
[18:13.680 --> 18:19.840]  understand very clearly if perhaps for the first time that the fairness doctrine is already in
[18:19.840 --> 18:31.040]  operation on WABC in New York. It was a year ago that the reclusive Matt Drudge of DrudgeReport.com
[18:32.240 --> 18:37.840]  visited Austin, Texas with an unannounced emergency message for our listeners.
[18:37.840 --> 18:49.600]  So I had a Supreme Court justice tell me to my face it's over for me.
[18:50.960 --> 18:54.880]  Said Matt, it's over for you. They've got the votes now to enforce copyright law.
[18:54.880 --> 18:58.560]  You're out of there. They're going to make it so headlines you can't even use headlines.
[18:59.440 --> 19:05.040]  To have a Supreme Court justice say that to my face that it's over. They've got the votes,
[19:05.040 --> 19:12.400]  which means time is limited. Time is not forever. How many more moons and sunrises will you see in
[19:12.400 --> 19:19.200]  your life rise and fall? There's not that many. It's a small amount. So for people to be saying
[19:19.200 --> 19:25.040]  with this attitude, oh, I'll get on with my life and my greatness sometime. No, no, you can't.
[19:25.040 --> 19:30.960]  We're being enslaved now and that's it under the TPP. They admit you can't put a headline
[19:30.960 --> 19:36.240]  to the New York Times. You're sending massive traffic to them. They're claiming you're taking
[19:36.240 --> 19:41.280]  their words. This is insane. And you had the Justice Stephen Breyer said we need to look at a global
[19:41.280 --> 19:45.920]  law now. Remember just recently getting blind up with it. So they're getting ready for these
[19:45.920 --> 19:50.160]  decisions to come. You thought Obamacare was shocking. You thought some of these other decisions
[19:50.160 --> 19:56.720]  were shocking. Wait until these copyright laws work their way up. And the Supreme Court decides
[19:56.720 --> 20:03.760]  you cannot have a website with news headlines linking across the board. In just four days,
[20:05.040 --> 20:13.120]  the domain registry system and the Internet IP address program will be handed over
[20:13.920 --> 20:18.880]  to a multinational consortium headed up by the United Nations and the Communist Chinese.
[20:19.680 --> 20:24.240]  The Communist Chinese are the biggest censors in the world and execute
[20:24.240 --> 20:31.200]  people that peacefully practice Buddhism. And this is who Facebook and Google and Twitter
[20:31.200 --> 20:38.320]  and Apple and others are working with. This is the new consortium that will decide the future rules
[20:38.320 --> 20:45.360]  of the Internet. Because whether it's China or areas in Africa, more and more poor people are
[20:45.360 --> 20:50.240]  now getting on the Internet in these countries. And those nations are finding it near impossible
[20:50.240 --> 20:56.800]  to completely censor that information. So what they're doing is coming to the United States and
[20:56.800 --> 21:03.600]  Europe and asking those governments to set up systems to censor the information promoting freedom
[21:04.320 --> 21:08.800]  before it gets to those other countries. Because if Obama is going to tell Africans you can't have
[21:08.800 --> 21:13.840]  air conditioning or cars, Americans can't have air conditioning or cars, or at least
[21:13.840 --> 21:18.400]  Africans shouldn't be able to see that. Ultimately, if you think about all the youth
[21:18.400 --> 21:23.120]  that everybody's mentioned here in Africa, if everybody's raising living standards to the point
[21:23.120 --> 21:27.760]  where everybody's got a car and everybody's got air conditioning and everybody's got a big house,
[21:29.280 --> 21:35.280]  well the planet will boil over. Just last week I had the former technical leader of the NSA on
[21:35.280 --> 21:40.480]  William Binning and he said clearly this is a corporate system establishing world government
[21:40.480 --> 21:46.480]  through the surveillance grid and the takeover of the Internet. What's the master strategy
[21:46.480 --> 21:50.160]  on building this technocracy? I mean, do they have one?
[21:51.760 --> 21:59.840]  I think it's a, well, this is my impression, okay. Certainly it is the population control,
[22:00.880 --> 22:06.080]  but not just of any given country, but of the world. And so what they're after and directed,
[22:06.080 --> 22:12.480]  and I think Obama has stated this from various points that he wanted a world community.
[22:12.480 --> 22:17.200]  So I think that's probably what they're after in order to do that, they have to be able to control
[22:17.200 --> 22:21.920]  the people of the world. So in order to do that, you have to have knowledge of them to know who's
[22:21.920 --> 22:28.400]  doing what so you can stop it or manipulate it any way you want. William Binning, that is the most
[22:28.400 --> 22:32.480]  profound thing. I think I've ever heard you say and you've said a lot of profound things. This is
[22:32.480 --> 22:38.400]  the key for a technocracy world government program and Davos admits that's their plan, but
[22:38.400 --> 22:42.880]  here you are the former leader of the national security agency telling us that that's what
[22:42.880 --> 22:46.400]  they're building. If I haven't heard you talk about world government being the objective,
[22:46.400 --> 22:52.000]  I mean, it clearly is. Can you elaborate with your geopolitical and geospatial and technical
[22:52.000 --> 22:58.000]  understanding? Yeah, I see that's the problem that technology has made this all possible.
[22:58.000 --> 23:04.400]  I mean, we could easily follow 12 to 20 billion phone calls a day. It's like 10 million people
[23:04.400 --> 23:08.880]  you know, like 10 million people moving around every day is trivial. That's a trivial issue.
[23:09.440 --> 23:14.160]  So all of that could be done by technology and yet they're claiming something is really difficult
[23:14.160 --> 23:20.160]  when in fact it's not. Obama's czars are now openly calling for the return of the fairness
[23:20.160 --> 23:25.120]  doctrine where you can't have any political opinion on talk radio. They've been targeting
[23:25.120 --> 23:30.960]  talk radio sponsors. They have been going after my show and Justice Dr. Drew was pulled off the
[23:30.960 --> 23:36.560]  year for saying, hey, Hillary's clearly got medical problems. What she's being prescribed is deadly
[23:36.560 --> 23:40.480]  when you mix the drugs together. I want to help her. He was fired one week later.
[23:40.480 --> 23:44.640]  There are two other things that gravely concern us. When she hit her head, she had to wear these
[23:44.640 --> 23:50.000]  prism glasses when she came out. That is brain damage and so that it's affecting her balance.
[23:50.000 --> 23:53.760]  Now clearly it hasn't affected her cognition, but tell us a little more about that.
[23:53.760 --> 24:02.800]  And now Michael Savage yesterday was first taken off WABC in New York. When the host began to
[24:02.800 --> 24:08.400]  gloat that it was a coup against him on air, Savage got word and began to basically criticize
[24:08.400 --> 24:16.480]  what was happening and was taken off 400 plus affiliates nationwide by CBS. Not only have I
[24:16.480 --> 24:22.080]  been sabotaged in the largest market that I have, it's clear sabotage because
[24:22.080 --> 24:26.720]  the two geniuses that they're using to fill in for me who have ratings that are about 40% lower
[24:26.720 --> 24:30.880]  than mine are gloating on the air that they've conducted a coup against Savage right on the
[24:30.880 --> 24:37.760]  air is I spent 30 minutes talking about Hillary's health problems. I read you every fact about it.
[24:38.480 --> 24:43.920]  I then read you the pharmacology of levodopa, which is the main drug for Parkinson's. And right in
[24:43.920 --> 24:49.360]  the middle of that discussion of levodopa and its side effects, I was cut off across the country.
[24:49.360 --> 24:54.080]  Now, I don't know how much longer this is going to hold up right now in the studio in which I'm
[24:54.080 --> 25:01.600]  broadcasting from military style. He's pulled off WABC. First, the decision is made where CBS
[25:01.600 --> 25:08.880]  is based in New York. Then he's taken off 30 minutes later from his 400 stations across the
[25:08.880 --> 25:13.920]  country. And he's sitting there in San Francisco with his headphones in the studio, broadcasting
[25:13.920 --> 25:19.840]  to no one for at least 10 minutes before he discovers that he's been taken off the air. And
[25:19.840 --> 25:26.000]  then he was told, you're basically done. Ladies and gentlemen, this is about a free press.
[25:26.000 --> 25:30.320]  Regardless of what you think about Michael Savage, Levin or Hayden, this is an attack on the very
[25:30.320 --> 25:37.040]  fundamental bedrock of this nation. This is 21st century book burning that's taking place.
[25:37.040 --> 25:42.240]  Dr. Savage came on the show twice in the last two weeks to talk about the dire straits of this
[25:42.240 --> 25:49.200]  country. And during several breaks last week while I was talking to him via Skype for my studio,
[25:50.080 --> 25:55.600]  he was telling me that he was concerned that this could be the last book he publishes.
[25:56.400 --> 26:02.320]  And that basically he was being censored by CBS and that he wanted to air the interview that he
[26:02.320 --> 26:07.520]  and I were having because we just had a powerful segment on his show. And I said, well, air whatever
[26:07.520 --> 26:12.720]  you want. He said, no, no, no, I know. But now CBS is telling me I can't air your show. I'm getting
[26:12.720 --> 26:19.120]  really massive heat from up on top. So he said, look, the country's in trouble. They're coming
[26:19.120 --> 26:24.000]  after our free speech. We went back on air, finished the segment. He was gone. I've called him
[26:24.000 --> 26:28.080]  today, haven't been able to get in touch with him. And now he's off the air. I mean, this could
[26:28.080 --> 26:34.240]  happen to us just like that. Because this is the season we're in of tyranny. This is the climate
[26:34.240 --> 26:40.240]  in our nation. Michael Savage said it himself. He's very proud to be the test case. They've gone
[26:40.240 --> 26:45.440]  after him first. And if they can get away with this, they can get away with shutting everybody off.
[26:46.000 --> 26:52.480]  We stand together or we hang separate. In closing, I want to ask viewers and listeners
[26:52.480 --> 26:59.280]  this paramount question. What is your lie on the scene? The censorship, the control is all
[26:59.280 --> 27:06.240]  suddenly being faced in. They're going from beta to 1.0 right now. And the fight is happening.
[27:07.200 --> 27:10.800]  A year in political time is like the blink of an eye. And in the next year,
[27:11.520 --> 27:17.360]  we're going to see the attempt to shut down free speech and bully the American people and others
[27:17.360 --> 27:21.600]  in the submission. Already in Europe, they arrest you if you criticize the open borders
[27:21.600 --> 27:28.000]  and the Islamic invasion. The mayor of London just assigned a police unit to arrest people that
[27:28.000 --> 27:32.880]  criticize Islam even mildly. You add this to all of the things that are happening. It is
[27:34.880 --> 27:42.400]  crisis level. We are facing 21st century warfare. It's being conducted by mega banks,
[27:42.400 --> 27:47.920]  huge corporations using giant migrant flows and collapsing third world populations that have
[27:47.920 --> 27:52.480]  been abused by this very system to bring down what's left of the West. Because the global
[27:52.480 --> 28:01.200]  is see prosperity and independence as competition. They see the West and any form of wealth and
[28:01.200 --> 28:07.760]  individuals controlling just a small part of their destiny as a threat. That's why this tyranny
[28:07.760 --> 28:12.960]  is the greatest tyranny humanity's ever faced. And that's why all of us are now Michael Savage.
[28:14.080 --> 28:19.840]  All of us are now Spartacus. Spartacus was the famous Roman slave,
[28:19.840 --> 28:26.480]  gladiator who led a revolt and almost toppled the Roman Empire. And it's a true story that they
[28:26.480 --> 28:31.120]  were killing thousands of the revolting slaves saying we're Spartacus, we're Spartacus. They
[28:31.120 --> 28:35.360]  would all say I'm Spartacus. Well, I don't want to say I'm jealous because it's a very dangerous
[28:35.360 --> 28:41.760]  position he's in. But the fact that they came for Michael Savage first really sets him into a very
[28:41.760 --> 28:47.040]  special category. They're very scared of him. And they've told me they're coming for us next.
[28:47.040 --> 28:51.760]  We're already under a lot of pressure. We need your prayers and support. We're harder to
[28:51.760 --> 28:56.560]  shut down because we self syndicate and we're working a lot of other internet platforms. But
[28:58.800 --> 29:05.440]  we're in some very dark walks. So we're all Michael Savage now. And if you don't stand with him,
[29:05.440 --> 29:10.320]  and if you don't stand against 21st century book burning, it's going to be your views and your ideas
[29:10.320 --> 29:17.600]  that are, that are banned next. So I hope everybody shares this report with everybody they know
[29:17.600 --> 29:22.320]  because this isn't just America's fight. This is the world's fight. And we're seeing the fall of
[29:22.320 --> 29:27.040]  our republic right now. If these people carrying this out are successful. I'm Alex Jones, signing
[29:27.040 --> 29:31.280]  off from the Info Wars News Center, however long it lasts in Austin, Texas, just reminding all of
[29:31.280 --> 29:36.320]  you that are out there watching that you really are the hope to turn this around. You are the
[29:36.320 --> 29:40.320]  resistance. The time has come to give them a shutdown.
[29:49.840 --> 29:56.400]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[30:00.400 --> 30:04.960]  New information is coming forth about the terrorist Omar Mateen who killed 49 people
[30:04.960 --> 30:10.480]  and wounded 53 others in the gay Orlando nightclub attack. A transcript of the conversation between
[30:10.480 --> 30:15.040]  Mateen and the police negotiator has been released and it sheds new light on Mateen's motivation
[30:15.040 --> 30:19.680]  for the murders. Mateen was triggered by a Pentagon drone strike a month before the attack he told
[30:19.680 --> 30:25.120]  the negotiator saying quote, yo, the airstrike that killed Abu Wahid a few weeks ago. That's
[30:25.120 --> 30:29.680]  what triggered it. Okay. They should not have bombed and killed Abu Wahid. He also identifies
[30:29.680 --> 30:35.680]  himself as a follower of ISIS. Now initial reports from several news outlets reported Mateen had
[30:35.680 --> 30:40.800]  described himself as gay, but he was a homophobe and a wife beater despite him making claims that
[30:40.800 --> 30:45.040]  he belonged to ISIS. The New York Times stated three days after the massacre that quote, the
[30:45.040 --> 30:50.320]  precise motivation of Mateen remains unclear. Now the false narrative was perpetuated for a week.
[30:50.320 --> 30:55.520]  The president himself attempting to paint Omar Mateen as a lone wolf shooter. Anything responsible
[30:55.520 --> 31:02.000]  that radical is long. I'm Margaret Howell reporting for info wars.com clean pure drinking water.

[32:07.120 --> 32:13.200]  the problem that pretty much scares me the most. I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins
[32:13.200 --> 32:19.280]  from food and water and beverages in my system. But right now we're dealing with massive parasites,
[32:19.280 --> 32:24.320]  which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism right now with all
[32:24.320 --> 32:30.240]  the refugees spreading disease around. We have biological warfare going on everywhere. These
[32:30.240 --> 32:33.760]  are all parasites. Tell us about all the stuff that says there's so many things that are in it.
[32:33.760 --> 32:39.120]  You have the name in there. You have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood. I recommend doing
[32:39.120 --> 32:43.440]  the parasite plans at least twice a year. All right. Well, I'm glad we've got some back in because
[32:43.440 --> 32:47.520]  I'm going back on it today. It just came back in yesterday. Living Defense, infowarslife.com.
[32:47.520 --> 32:52.560]  And folks, you can't lose full of stuff that's great for your body, period. And you support
[32:52.560 --> 32:56.800]  the broadcast, infowarslife.com. Thank you, Dr. Group, from the Global Healing Center.
[32:56.800 --> 33:10.880]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[33:10.880 --> 33:28.320]  He aligns himself with the truth, and it's time for you to choose a side. You're listening to Alex Jones.
[33:28.320 --> 33:32.240]  There are, of course, those who do not want us to speak. You think? Just let me think.
[33:32.240 --> 33:37.600]  I'm sick. Even now, orders are being shouted into telephones, and men with guns will soon be on their
[33:37.600 --> 33:42.800]  way. It's Chancellor Sutler. Damn it. Why? Because while the truncheon may be used at
[33:42.800 --> 33:49.440]  lieu of conversation, words will always retain their power. Words are for the means to meaning,
[33:49.440 --> 33:57.040]  and for those who will listen, the enunciation of truth. There is something terribly wrong
[33:57.040 --> 34:00.880]  with this country, isn't there? You designed it, sir. You wanted it foolproof. You told me every
[34:00.880 --> 34:06.240]  television end longer. Cruelty, and injustice, intolerance, and oppression. And where once
[34:06.240 --> 34:11.280]  you had the freedom to object, and don't think and speak as you saw fit, you now have senses and
[34:11.280 --> 34:17.440]  systems of surveillance, perversing your conformity and selecting your submachine. How did this happen?
[34:18.080 --> 34:22.880]  Who's to blame? Well, certainly there are those who are more responsible than others.
[34:22.880 --> 34:28.480]  They will be held accountable. But again, truth be told, if you're looking for the guilty,
[34:28.480 --> 34:37.040]  you need only look into a mirror. I know why you did it. I know you were afraid. Who wouldn't be? War,
[34:37.040 --> 34:43.040]  terror, and disease? There were a myriad of problems which conspired to corrupt your reason
[34:43.040 --> 34:48.640]  and rob you of your common sense. Fear got the best of you, and in your panic you turned to the
[34:48.640 --> 34:54.720]  now high Chancellor, Adam Sutler. He promised you order, he promised you peace, and all he
[34:54.720 --> 35:01.840]  demanded in return was your silent, obedient consent.
[35:04.640 --> 35:11.920]  There is a war. It's happening now. It will decide the fate of humanity. The time to choose sides
[35:11.920 --> 35:19.920]  has come. We are the resistance. We are the Info War. We're 40 days now from the historic election.
[35:19.920 --> 35:26.720]  And whether Trump wins or loses, we win because he's promoting nationalism, populism,
[35:27.440 --> 35:33.520]  anti-political, correct behavior that shows everyone it's okay to speak out. It's okay to
[35:33.520 --> 35:40.960]  stand up. It's okay to be who you are. Let me do this. Let me just read to you headlines today
[35:42.720 --> 35:47.440]  that are from all my different stacks. World news, economy, info wars, drudge, you name it.
[35:47.440 --> 35:56.000]  And look at the theme. It's open world government. It's our nations having to do
[35:56.000 --> 36:01.200]  what the UN and multinational corporations say. In fact, can we queue up Obama's
[36:01.200 --> 36:05.360]  one-minute, 20-second clip from the UN last week again where he called for global government?
[36:06.800 --> 36:13.520]  And he says we need to give up our sovereignty. He says, believe me, I have trouble with my fellow
[36:13.520 --> 36:19.520]  Americans getting them to understand international standards as if foreign countries are running
[36:19.520 --> 36:24.640]  the US. It's globalist that are running the US, the same ones that have run those nations into
[36:24.640 --> 36:30.160]  the ground because they don't follow the same rules. They're exempt from almost everything they
[36:30.160 --> 36:37.680]  foist on us. And they sit back and call themselves geniuses because they hijacked the world economy
[36:37.680 --> 36:42.720]  and because they're consolidating such wealth. But they're so greedy they never even put infrastructure
[36:42.720 --> 36:49.360]  back in for the general public. And as a rule of hand, they try to dumb us down as much as possible
[36:49.360 --> 36:54.640]  and use weaponized media to keep us in the dark so we can be more easily managed. And finally,
[36:55.360 --> 37:00.880]  you see in the Associated Press and you see in the Hollywood Reporter what we've been telling you
[37:00.880 --> 37:05.680]  for at least a decade and that is now even in the London Guardian and the New York Times,
[37:06.400 --> 37:09.760]  almost every billionaire has run to the hills in Australia or New Zealand.
[37:09.760 --> 37:18.160]  Almost every major billionaire has basically fitted out giant yachts with three, four,
[37:18.160 --> 37:22.400]  five years of food on board and fully automatic weapons and rocket launchers.
[37:23.440 --> 37:28.480]  And they're not doing it out of hysteria or fear. Some of these billionaires started their own
[37:28.480 --> 37:32.720]  companies. They're really smart. They're good people. Others were the children and grandchildren
[37:32.720 --> 37:40.240]  of robber barons. But they are escaping. Hundreds of articles a week. Chicago Tribune headline. The
[37:40.240 --> 37:46.800]  rich are fleeing Chicago. Millionaires are leaving Chicago report. They just try to run out to the
[37:46.800 --> 37:54.000]  countryside, put a fence up around their yard, put in well water and a wind turbine, maybe some solar.
[37:54.000 --> 38:03.920]  But the really rich people, I told the story six years ago of going and filing some corporations
[38:05.040 --> 38:09.440]  which you do for every new film or new venture you put out for liability protection.
[38:12.000 --> 38:16.080]  And I'm there in this big fancy law firm. Never been there before. I'm just there to
[38:16.080 --> 38:22.720]  file some papers. Attractive lady walks over. Older lady but detractive and says,
[38:22.720 --> 38:26.480]  you know, I am. I'm like, no, no, you are. She's one of the big listeners. I'm selling
[38:26.480 --> 38:30.080]  everything I got and I'm moving out of the United States, telling where she was going.
[38:30.080 --> 38:34.400]  She said, you can talk about this. Just don't say who I am. Look up who I am later.
[38:34.400 --> 38:37.920]  Even six years ago, you know, the iPhones were so slow. I didn't check it in my pocket.
[38:38.880 --> 38:42.400]  And I did. But you know, the business I hadn't left and I googled her that night at home and I
[38:42.400 --> 38:46.640]  was like, oh my gosh, this is a lady that's one of the biggest owners of a defense contractor
[38:46.640 --> 38:49.680]  company. This is a lady that owns all these big banking firms admittedly worth
[38:49.680 --> 38:56.800]  tens of billions of dollars. And for like 15 minutes, she told me,
[38:57.360 --> 39:01.920]  she said, there won't be a U S in four or five or six years. Now that's six years ago.
[39:03.360 --> 39:06.400]  I said, what do you mean? She said, what do I mean? It's everything you say,
[39:06.400 --> 39:11.520]  but I've confirmed it at the highest levels and everybody else is getting out of here.
[39:13.120 --> 39:15.440]  And I said, well, what's going to happen? She goes, you know,
[39:15.440 --> 39:21.920]  and she said, you need to get ready to get really famous and really successful.
[39:22.960 --> 39:31.680]  And I said, what do you mean? And she said, buddy, you got it. And when all this stuff starts
[39:31.680 --> 39:37.200]  happening, you are going to have credibility that is stratospheric. Now I've told that story
[39:37.200 --> 39:41.760]  since that happened. And now here we are. And it's all happening and things always
[39:41.760 --> 39:48.400]  take a little longer than people think. And I wish she was wrong, but panic, anxiety,
[39:48.400 --> 39:53.520]  spark, rush to build luxury bunkers for LA super rich. Let me tell you, LA goes upside down. No
[39:53.520 --> 40:02.640]  bunker is going to keep you safe. That is the last place you want to be on earth. You do not want
[40:02.640 --> 40:12.240]  to be there. We should get, you know what? It's time to fly Joe Scousen back here. I mean, he flies
[40:12.240 --> 40:18.800]  himself, pilot. It's time to tell him I'll pay for the fuel to fly him here in his jet or
[40:20.480 --> 40:26.400]  fly him here commercial. I want to get Scousen here to maybe shoot a new special report in a
[40:26.400 --> 40:31.040]  mini documentary. We've already made one film with him, strategic relocation. And that was about
[40:31.040 --> 40:38.640]  four years ago because things are really, really starting to boil over. Obviously. Now I said I'd
[40:38.640 --> 40:46.080]  mentioned headlines. Let me just do that right now. US owes black people reparations for a history of
[40:46.800 --> 40:53.040]  racial terrorism says UN panel headed up by the Saudi Arabians who are the most abusive on earth
[40:53.040 --> 40:59.840]  after North Korea. Oh, I'm sorry. That's the Washington Post. London is open. Mayor Khan
[40:59.840 --> 41:07.200]  vows into five Briggs it and offers city visas to immigrants. He supports the EU. He supports the UN.
[41:07.200 --> 41:12.880]  He says he will ignore federal law and he will ignore the parliament just as the EU does and he
[41:12.880 --> 41:19.200]  will bring in the illegals and the jihadis himself as express.co.uk. Remember this is
[41:19.200 --> 41:22.640]  an Alex Jones. I told you months ago he was going to open the borders up and bring everybody in
[41:22.640 --> 41:29.840]  and create a Lunderstand. He's now announcing it. We know the plan before we got Soros' emails
[41:29.840 --> 41:34.720]  five weeks ago. We already knew the plan. It was word for word, but we already knew. You can see it.
[41:35.520 --> 41:39.600]  Soros says we're going to bring in giant incompatible groups, break society down,
[41:39.600 --> 41:45.760]  bring in civil emergency over the top of that and then segregate everybody and control everyone
[41:45.760 --> 41:51.600]  with that divide and conquer strategy. The Clintons call it the broken coalition strategy.
[41:54.320 --> 42:04.400]  I mean, boom. Here it is. UN. Islamic mayor. It goes on and on. Obama administration and UN
[42:04.400 --> 42:12.880]  announced global police force to fight extremism in US run by the UN. DHS accidentally legalized
[42:12.880 --> 42:17.120]  750 immigrants just magically who had just shown up and of course they just magically
[42:17.120 --> 42:21.040]  bust them and fly them in and all the rest of it. That's just because Obama has the UN,
[42:21.040 --> 42:26.160]  you see, running this program with the founder of the EU, Peter Sutherland, as the head of the EU
[42:26.160 --> 42:31.760]  Borders and Migrant Bureau. That's their new 21st century weapon. This is the attack.
[42:34.400 --> 42:38.560]  Obama administration wants to surrender US control of the internet to global bureaucracy.
[42:38.560 --> 42:43.280]  That's from months ago. I wanted to point that out. It happens in three days. Donald Trump came out
[42:43.280 --> 42:49.920]  just five days ago and said, or six days ago, and signaled opposition to handing internet control
[42:49.920 --> 42:55.120]  to the United Nations. Well, sorry, they hand them the DNS servers, the codes, the address systems
[42:56.240 --> 43:00.480]  where they can disappear anybody they want off the web where no one else can find you.
[43:01.120 --> 43:04.560]  And that's just a nuclear option to what's already happening with Google
[43:04.560 --> 43:09.440]  and Microsoft and Apple and Facebook, where they only direct you to news you want.
[43:11.120 --> 43:17.200]  My iPhone broke. So I said, get me a new one to the crew. They got me a seven, I guess the new one.
[43:17.200 --> 43:20.400]  And I'm actually going to turn it back in and get an older one.
[43:22.720 --> 43:26.720]  And I've said I need to get rid of them. But I am a media person. I have a journalist. I really
[43:26.720 --> 43:31.120]  do work on it. I know it's evil, but my good, I think outweighs it. But still, I can't preach
[43:31.120 --> 43:36.480]  against these little computers that track us and follow us and control us if I'm sitting here using
[43:36.480 --> 43:41.360]  one. But I was on it for hours last night. When someone calls you and does a voicemail without
[43:41.360 --> 43:46.240]  you asking it to, it transcripts what they said. And that's NSA technology, old technology, but
[43:46.240 --> 43:49.920]  they're just incorporating it all in our face, making it ubiquitous.
[43:54.480 --> 44:01.040]  And everything about it would just launch news that was salon and New York Times and Washington
[44:01.040 --> 44:08.560]  Post. And in the news feeds, it was all bashing Trump. So I search engine myself in the news that
[44:08.560 --> 44:15.920]  kept redirecting me to wouldn't even say what it was. It was just directing me to it. And it was
[44:15.920 --> 44:22.320]  all attack pieces for dozens of pages of links. Just everything bad about Alex Jones, every
[44:22.320 --> 44:27.120]  distortion, every lie. This is the technocracy that we see forcing you into their internet
[44:27.120 --> 44:32.480]  ghettos that Matt Roche talked about. So there's the news on that front.
[44:34.960 --> 44:39.200]  Pat Caddell calls off stupidity of Republicans in internet takeover debate. It's another sign
[44:39.200 --> 44:45.440]  of America selling out. And that's absolutely what's happening. The Republicans are going
[44:45.440 --> 44:48.480]  along with it just like they do TPP and the rest of it because they're getting bought off.
[44:50.240 --> 44:53.840]  You know, crooks of the old days just robbed banks. Now they just sell out our infrastructure.
[44:53.840 --> 44:57.840]  And then the UN admits they're going to censor us under their new policies and they're already
[44:57.840 --> 45:03.840]  beta testing all that panic anxiety spark rush to build luxury bunkers. I mentioned that and it
[45:03.840 --> 45:09.440]  ties into China debt could wreck the global economy. Leading economists warns country could
[45:09.440 --> 45:16.480]  suffer a calamitous slowdown. Now let's talk about this. I have asked my crew.
[45:17.520 --> 45:22.080]  This is something that's fallen through the cracks over the years to go back and find news clips
[45:22.080 --> 45:26.320]  on YouTube and to go back and find news articles. I mean, I remember some of the headlines myself
[45:26.320 --> 45:33.440]  and just do a little news piece showing this where we told you five years ago when they
[45:33.440 --> 45:38.880]  were debating Obamacare that the versions of the version that passed have death panels,
[45:38.880 --> 45:43.600]  have rationing of care and you can't keep your doctor most of the time and it does double and
[45:43.600 --> 45:50.960]  triple your prices and that there are penalties of up to $5,000 per person and your employer.
[45:50.960 --> 45:57.520]  Now I'm experiencing it with the CPAs and the law firms right now where I have
[45:58.320 --> 46:04.000]  basically 50 employees and I've got some contractors and so by law $5,000 fine per person
[46:05.280 --> 46:11.120]  and my employees $5,000 fines they've been ratcheting up the last few years run by the IRS
[46:11.120 --> 46:18.320]  who hired 18,000 new people in the Obamacare bill to enforce it. So I said this is a tax and
[46:18.320 --> 46:24.320]  it's not evenly laid on people because Obamacare can give thousands of companies waivers to not
[46:24.320 --> 46:29.200]  have to get Obamacare like McDonald's so that you know your hamburger chain goes under it's
[46:29.200 --> 46:35.040]  got to pay for it but McDonald's doesn't. The whole thing's discriminatory and there are news clips
[46:35.040 --> 46:39.760]  with Rachel Maddow and others saying I'm deeply racist, I'm hateful, I'm bad, I'm evil, I'm lying
[46:39.760 --> 46:44.000]  about our first black president saying that this thing has fines and fees. I remember a story two
[46:44.000 --> 46:49.920]  years ago when the fines were starting to kick in at certain levels. Now this year it kicks in on
[46:49.920 --> 47:00.240]  everybody and I remember the headlines everywhere. Matt Drudge caught lying. Drudge lies. There is
[47:00.240 --> 47:04.640]  no Obamacare penalty. Remember Drudge said I'm not trying to obsess on Drudge. This is what
[47:04.640 --> 47:09.120]  happened. I mean this is in the news. This is an example. Just Drudge is in the news all the
[47:09.120 --> 47:12.000]  place. That's what we're talking about Drudge every five minutes and it's not a Drudge obsession,
[47:12.000 --> 47:16.160]  it's just like it's a fact. There's lots of sand at the seashore folks. That's what we're
[47:16.160 --> 47:20.480]  building sand castles with here and so Drudge comes out and says in tweets I'm going to just
[47:21.520 --> 47:25.760]  basically pay the fine. I'm not getting Obamacare. I'm not being forced to do what you want going
[47:25.760 --> 47:32.160]  out to some big scam computer site where the insurance companies pass me around like a $2
[47:32.160 --> 47:39.200]  whore. That's what they do. The exchange is what they call it. I spent days on that thing
[47:39.200 --> 47:44.400]  getting insurance last year because I was kicked off my insurance by Obamacare that I'd had for
[47:44.400 --> 47:50.960]  18 years. Oh and by the way double the first year but get this. We can show where they said
[47:50.960 --> 47:57.520]  there is no penalty. There is no tax. Racist Republicans are telling you this
[48:00.160 --> 48:04.080]  and you're just sitting there reading the bill. You're talking to CPAs. They go no this is going
[48:04.080 --> 48:10.000]  to be a tax. This is going to be a penalty. Nico had a joke this morning when I was ranting and
[48:10.000 --> 48:18.640]  raving about it. He goes now Alex. He goes you know it's not a penalty. It's a tax and that's
[48:18.640 --> 48:26.720]  how they play these games. So now House Republicans warn against Obama administration's attempt to
[48:26.720 --> 48:32.000]  bail out Obamacare insurers because the insurance companies wrote this with the big ones get to
[48:32.000 --> 48:36.800]  make money on the front and on the end then it's meant to collapse healthcare. One of the authors
[48:36.800 --> 48:41.920]  of it on Fox News. Emmanuel's brother even admitted oh this is just step one. Once this wrecks the
[48:41.920 --> 48:46.800]  system we're going to go to a single payer. They admit Cloward and Piv and they're wrecking it
[48:46.800 --> 48:53.200]  on Fox. Here's another one. Insurance company sues for $223 million after Congress blocks
[48:53.200 --> 49:00.880]  Obamacare bailouts and then here's what I was mentioning. $8.1 million taxpayers paid $1.7 billion
[49:00.880 --> 49:06.880]  in Obamacare penalties in 2014 alone. It's taken the feds a year and a half to release the numbers.
[49:06.880 --> 49:11.840]  That was the first year the penalty started kicking in three years ago. Can you imagine
[49:11.840 --> 49:19.120]  what they are? It's going to be the first year. It was 8.1 million people yet with $1.7 billion
[49:20.160 --> 49:29.600]  in tax penalties but there is no penalty. Obama said so and the lies. We've got Hillary with
[49:29.600 --> 49:35.920]  Lester Holt interrupting Trump 40 plus times. Her seven. Her giving hand signals. Like it was a
[49:35.920 --> 49:40.640]  three stooges playing poker. Holt following her every move interrupting whenever she I mean it was
[49:41.200 --> 49:46.080]  this hulk it's so rigged. I'm like asking myself how much more rigged is this going to get?
[49:47.520 --> 49:52.560]  It's a lie of racist. Obamacare is free. You can keep your doctor. There's no penalties.
[49:52.560 --> 49:58.160]  That says right here 18,000 new IRS agents. $5,000 your fines. No it doesn't.
[49:58.160 --> 50:04.560]  Yeah it's in the subsection. Shut up racist. And you got some crazy Nazi collaborator running
[50:04.560 --> 50:07.520]  around spending hundreds of millions of dollars to start race war and I'm just like
[50:08.800 --> 50:14.400]  how far does this go? How much crazier does it go? And then the UN's involved with George Soros.
[50:14.400 --> 50:19.440]  We have the emails trying to cause a civil war so they can then bring in some global government
[50:19.440 --> 50:25.520]  leftist truth commission reorganization of the United States. I mean that's what I told you they
[50:25.520 --> 50:33.920]  do 10 years ago. Now it's all in the Washington Post today. And they're announcing babies being
[50:33.920 --> 50:40.640]  born with three parents. New scientists. Just because we can. And designer humanoids and
[50:44.240 --> 50:48.480]  we have lost our moral compass. That's why this is happening. I'm going to come back and we've
[50:48.480 --> 50:53.680]  got, oh by the way we have a clip from 2003 of Trump saying he was against the Iraq war from Fox
[50:53.680 --> 50:58.800]  News. They say it doesn't exist. I found five clips of him saying it. But oh but Lester Holt said it
[50:58.800 --> 51:04.880]  wasn't true. Hi this is Ted Anderson. Investment Rarity is a 43-year-old company has created the

[54:19.920 --> 54:26.240]  four years ago they were saying there is no penalty, there is no tax, but then it phases in
[54:26.240 --> 54:34.000]  $1,000 the first year, $3,000 the next year, $5,000 the next. And there's actually language in there
[54:34.000 --> 54:41.040]  that if, quote, Obama wants to, because it gives the president a blank check and the next president,
[54:41.040 --> 54:46.160]  they can go in and maybe raise the tax even more. But we actually found some of the headlines
[54:46.160 --> 54:53.440]  associated press, you name it, saying, Matt Drudge is lying, there is no penalty, there is no tax.
[54:53.440 --> 54:57.520]  Let's put some of those on screen for TV viewers. Just a reminder, new listeners and listeners,
[54:57.520 --> 55:04.240]  that's TMP, Matt Drudge is probably lying, they added that, on paying huge Obamacare liberty tax.
[55:04.240 --> 55:08.240]  Now let's go back to another clip. Now we have tweets put out by the White House,
[55:08.240 --> 55:13.440]  liberty tax, White House media attack after Drudge pays Obamacare opt-out penalty.
[55:13.440 --> 55:18.880]  And they go on to say when this started, three years ago, that it doesn't exist. Tell that to
[55:18.880 --> 55:23.360]  Darren McBreen. He says I can talk about it, I want to give him a piece on it, one of our reporters
[55:23.360 --> 55:28.400]  been here five years. Darren's been paying the penalty for three years and it just went up this
[55:28.400 --> 55:40.800]  year to $5,000 juicies, $5,000 juicies for him. But it doesn't exist and Matt Drudge is a liar.
[55:40.800 --> 55:49.200]  And of course, Obama is calling for world government, so is the Pope, but that's a different world
[55:49.200 --> 55:54.560]  government than I was talking about all those years ago. Oh, but there's the headline, Obamacare
[55:54.560 --> 56:01.680]  penalty increasing sharply in 2016. And then I have all these mainstream articles here announcing
[56:01.680 --> 56:08.240]  that taxpayers in the first year of Obamacare paid $1.7 billion in penalties for not getting it.
[56:08.240 --> 56:14.560]  Oh, excuse me, and who implemented it? The internal revenue service. That's what the bill said.
[56:14.560 --> 56:21.200]  It's what the bill did. And now you know why I get mad watching Lester Holt and Hillary Clinton.
[56:22.960 --> 56:30.720]  I mean, it was the biggest load of lies. I was short-circuiting. It was all lies,
[56:30.720 --> 56:34.880]  except for her saying, I'm going to extrajudicially just put you on list. You can't buy guns anymore.
[56:34.880 --> 56:39.760]  No more due process. Only thing she said that was true, a monstrous creature.
[56:41.920 --> 56:45.760]  And they say we have no right to exist. The attorney general said three months ago,
[56:45.760 --> 56:50.080]  conservatives have no right to have media platforms. We need to censor them. She had to
[56:50.080 --> 56:55.360]  back off of that, but they are now moving forward. And Hillary put out an email three weeks ago in
[56:55.360 --> 57:00.720]  fundraising saying, we're going to shut down the alt media. I remember thinking about who I named,
[57:00.720 --> 57:05.520]  Drudge and Breitbart, myself, and people got attacked by her, but she didn't attack Savage.
[57:05.520 --> 57:09.040]  And Savage was on two weeks ago saying, I'm really upset I wasn't named. He said some of that on
[57:09.040 --> 57:12.160]  there during the break. He goes, yeah, I'm upset she didn't name me. She named you. And I went,
[57:12.160 --> 57:16.720]  don't worry, buddy. They're even more scared of you. That's why they didn't name you. And you
[57:16.720 --> 57:23.840]  notice they took him off and people are like, did you think it really happened? No, he was just
[57:23.840 --> 57:26.640]  telling me a week before that he might be kicked off the air sooner than it happened. Yeah, it
[57:26.640 --> 57:31.840]  happened. He's off the air. I guess I'll just be off there and people be, oh, well, that was just
[57:31.840 --> 57:36.960]  got shot in the street. No big deal. You know, or whatever happens. I'll just never commit suicide.
[57:36.960 --> 57:42.640]  No, that folks, my head is spinning right now. Before I go any further, ladies and gentlemen,
[57:42.640 --> 57:47.280]  please support the broadcast by the products. They're excellent in FullWarsLife.com. We have our
[57:47.280 --> 57:52.800]  new probiotic seven years in development is being developed two years before I even got into business

[57:59.120 --> 58:04.320]  probiotic strains. We keep it refrigerated here. We ship it to you with an ice pack. And again,
[58:04.320 --> 58:08.960]  that is very, very important to get into the refrigerator to have it last. I mean, I mean,
[58:08.960 --> 58:15.200]  last the longest and get the biggest effect in FullWarsLife.com. Sign up for auto ship and get
[58:15.200 --> 58:20.000]  10% off additional and so many other specials. Free shipping is extended, but only for one more
[58:20.000 --> 58:24.320]  day and then it's over. There's some other specials as well. Stay with us. We'll be right back with
[58:24.320 --> 58:31.360]  hour two. Spread the word. It's an info war and you are an active participant. We are now 40 days
[58:31.360 --> 58:38.480]  from the November 8th, 2016 election. You're listening to the Alex Jones show. And we are now
[58:39.360 --> 58:45.840]  only three days out from the UN official takeover of the web and the power to regulate is the power
[58:45.840 --> 58:52.160]  to destroy. And they say they're coming for us. Get ready. It's not just our water we need to filter.
[58:52.160 --> 58:56.560]  It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned. It's the air we're breathing, especially for our
[58:56.560 --> 59:02.560]  children. The artificial particulates of the chemicals is absolutely weighing down our immune
[59:02.560 --> 59:08.160]  systems. The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa pure groundbreaking
[59:08.160 --> 59:13.600]  water filtration systems have now developed Alexa pure breeze, whether it's your home or office,
[59:13.600 --> 59:18.720]  you owe it to yourself, your coworkers, your family, your children to the best job you can to
[59:18.720 --> 59:24.160]  purify your air. The elite are masters at poisoning our environment while themselves doing things
[59:24.160 --> 59:28.880]  that mitigate or avoid most toxic effects for themselves. The general public doesn't.
[59:30.000 --> 59:35.920]  The Alexa pure breeze would be a steal at $300, $400, $500. One of these systems can keep 800
[59:35.920 --> 59:40.160]  square feet incredibly clean. This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house,
[59:40.160 --> 59:46.000]  replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job. Find out why this system is so
[59:46.000 --> 59:48.560]  revolutionary today and then fullwarstore.com.
[59:48.560 --> 01:00:17.520]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show big brother mainstream media government cover
[01:00:18.560 --> 01:00:26.560]  you want to stop tyranny? Well, so does he live from the info wars.com studios. It's Alex Jones.
[01:00:33.600 --> 01:00:38.480]  You want to use the analogy of landing a passenger plane on the Hudson
[01:00:39.600 --> 01:00:42.240]  when the Saul Clint Eastwoods place movie. It's pretty powerful.
[01:00:42.240 --> 01:00:48.720]  They always tell you don't try to make it back to the airfield. That's that's when people crash.
[01:00:51.760 --> 01:00:54.960]  And I can tell you right now, we're not going to get America back to the airfield.
[01:00:55.760 --> 01:00:59.600]  And we're going to have a crash landing. But I hope it's going to be like the miracle on the Hudson
[01:01:00.240 --> 01:01:10.720]  because we're dealing with organized crime worldwide that is in a consolidation phase to
[01:01:10.720 --> 01:01:17.920]  establish a planetary regime. And a few days ago, we had the last week, we had the former head of the
[01:01:17.920 --> 01:01:25.040]  technical person actually ran the national security agency actually ran the spying.
[01:01:27.120 --> 01:01:32.080]  And I said, what are they building? And he said a private corporate world government project.
[01:01:32.640 --> 01:01:38.080]  And the spy grid is a technocracy takeover of the planet. Now that's my analysis because that's
[01:01:38.080 --> 01:01:43.840]  his analysis and that's reality. That's what it is. And they have scooped up every other
[01:01:43.840 --> 01:01:49.200]  tyrannical project and program that was out there like the European Union project that was a Nazi
[01:01:49.760 --> 01:01:56.560]  living space or Leibnz-Frau, I think you say it in Deutsch program. So it's not a Nazi conspiracy.
[01:01:56.560 --> 01:02:02.400]  It's just it's got the British Empire cobbled into the Nazis teamed up with the Muslims.
[01:02:02.400 --> 01:02:09.040]  I mean, it is a disastrous situation we're facing. And I look at the stack of news I covered in the
[01:02:09.040 --> 01:02:15.600]  last hour, Washington Post, New York Times, just, oh, the UN's taking over. It's going to battle racism
[01:02:15.600 --> 01:02:20.400]  in America. It's going to run your police. And it's going to make sure there's reparations. Oh,
[01:02:20.400 --> 01:02:27.200]  the UN is going to have a carbon tax and give it to poor people. And then we actually got the
[01:02:27.200 --> 01:02:32.640]  carbon tax, which they wanted to be ratified six years ago in secret. And Lord Monkton got it.
[01:02:32.640 --> 01:02:35.760]  And they said, no, that's our document. You're right. Who got it? Other Russians did. It was
[01:02:35.760 --> 01:02:40.000]  evil Russians, those pesky Russians, because they don't want to be under carbon taxes. Putin said
[01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:45.440]  it's a world government project to shut down Russia, shut down any nation state. And then we
[01:02:45.440 --> 01:02:52.800]  got the document. It was right at double. One point under double the taxes on the third world
[01:02:52.800 --> 01:02:58.160]  that would be on the first world. The globalists hate the third world. They've kept their foot on
[01:02:58.160 --> 01:03:03.120]  their neck. They've kept them in squalor. They've put dictators in. They've sold, you know, cultural
[01:03:03.120 --> 01:03:11.280]  division. They've financed military attacks by neighbors. Rebel armies. They promoted communism
[01:03:11.280 --> 01:03:16.640]  in Latin America and Africa as the way to counter the robber barons who literally created communism
[01:03:16.640 --> 01:03:22.960]  and bankrolled it and created the Soviet Union. It's all declassified. It's all confirmed. Joseph
[01:03:22.960 --> 01:03:27.280]  McCarthy knew it all. Russians 10 years ago released their files. It was worse than he said.
[01:03:27.840 --> 01:03:32.320]  Basically, everything he said was true that it was 10 times worse. They just go, you're being mean
[01:03:32.320 --> 01:03:40.800]  to this little old black lady that's a custodian at the FBI. You're being mean to this little
[01:03:40.800 --> 01:03:47.840]  old white lady or this little old janitor. And it turned out no, they were KGB agents. And
[01:03:49.680 --> 01:03:54.880]  they loved McCarthy when he was just helping set up a police state. Because after all, we were
[01:03:54.880 --> 01:03:58.080]  being invaded. We were being taken over. The Russians were killing millions of their own people,
[01:03:58.080 --> 01:04:02.560]  millions of Ukrainians, millions of Poles. They were horrible. The atrocities were terrible.
[01:04:02.560 --> 01:04:07.280]  They were persecuting Christians. We got to do something. He was a war hero, World War II,
[01:04:07.280 --> 01:04:12.800]  tail gunner. Decorated highly. Patriot. But when he discovered and came out and said,
[01:04:12.800 --> 01:04:16.480]  the U.S. Army, he had this from the Army because they were patriots, and there has been ordered
[01:04:16.480 --> 01:04:19.600]  to prop up the Russians and give them weapons and give them intel. And we're working with them,
[01:04:19.600 --> 01:04:25.840]  and he flew, and they went, you went too far blaming our army there, boy. That's preposterous.
[01:04:26.400 --> 01:04:29.760]  He said, yeah, there's all these big, rich, powerful people, and they're funny because they
[01:04:29.760 --> 01:04:34.640]  want to use his new form of tyranny. And you got to warn everybody. And he's like, oh, shut up.
[01:04:34.640 --> 01:04:42.480]  Ha, ha, ha, you old nut. And now here you are, not a communist conspiracy. It's a big mega bank
[01:04:42.480 --> 01:04:48.960]  conspiracy where they're tax exempt on 300-foot yachts with helicopters and jump jets and hundreds
[01:04:48.960 --> 01:04:54.000]  of mistresses and space stations they're building and all this other crap, while they steal everything
[01:04:54.000 --> 01:05:02.000]  from us and they consolidate economy. It's amazing. If you want to know how Huma Abedin,
[01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:07.440]  the top aide to Hillary Clinton, really feels about Sharia law, look no further than her father,
[01:05:07.440 --> 01:05:12.400]  a video surfaced of Said Abedin outlining his view of Sharia law and how the western world
[01:05:12.400 --> 01:05:19.200]  has turned Muslims hostile. The video was recorded in 1971 and titled The World of Islam. Said Abedin
[01:05:19.200 --> 01:05:23.920]  indicates that any culture change will have to be validated by the tenants of Islam. The video
[01:05:23.920 --> 01:05:28.160]  provides a window into the Abedin's family ideology, which has been examined for its
[01:05:28.160 --> 01:05:32.560]  connection with the Muslim Brotherhood. The Abedin family are responsible for creating the
[01:05:32.560 --> 01:05:37.680]  Journal of Muslim Minority Affairs, of which Huma Abedin lists herself as the assistant
[01:05:37.680 --> 01:05:42.800]  editor of for 12 years. The publication is accused of having ties to the Muslim Brotherhood and for
[01:05:42.800 --> 01:05:48.880]  promoting a hard line Islamic ideological stance. She's also had a hand in the work of the Institute
[01:05:48.880 --> 01:05:54.080]  of Muslim Minority Affairs, a think tank established in Saudi Arabia. It's been accused that a
[01:05:54.080 --> 01:05:59.520]  financier of Al-Qaeda funded it. I'm Margaret Hale reporting for infowars.com.

[01:07:30.320 --> 01:07:36.640]  Now, in 2016, even more information has been revealed concerning the connection between iodine
[01:07:36.640 --> 01:07:42.560]  and the gut, which many experts are now saying could be the biggest revelation ever concerning
[01:07:42.560 --> 01:07:47.120]  iodine. You can pull these studies up for yourself. This is the real deal, folks, and the truth is
[01:07:47.120 --> 01:07:52.720]  that iodine is essential, in my view, to any optimum health regimen. Stock up on survival

[01:08:07.280 --> 01:08:14.560]  Wednesday, September 28, 2016, marks only 40 days in the countdown to the general election.
[01:08:14.560 --> 01:08:33.440]  We are 40 days out. I'm your host, Alex Jones. We're here Monday through Friday,
[01:08:33.440 --> 01:08:38.960]  from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Central Standard Time. I've got a bunch of really important video clips I
[01:08:38.960 --> 01:08:44.080]  want to play here in the next few minutes, and I want to go to Dr. Group. To talk about a host
[01:08:44.080 --> 01:08:52.480]  of issues, but I noticed a few days ago that the woman was preparing to give birth, and now she's
[01:08:52.480 --> 01:09:00.000]  given birth to a child that has the DNA of three people in it, and now they've got groups talking
[01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:06.640]  about, oh, two gay men want to have a child together, so they'll splice their DNA, and they're
[01:09:06.640 --> 01:09:11.360]  talking about, oh, we'll have maybe three women where it's, you know, this new right to do whatever
[01:09:11.360 --> 01:09:17.920]  you want, and as long as it's liberal, as long as it's trendy, it's okay. Well, I've actually
[01:09:17.920 --> 01:09:23.360]  interviewed a lot of genetic engineers and experts, one of them years ago, was making millions of
[01:09:23.360 --> 01:09:29.040]  dollars a year in London, and he was creating a potato that basically lasted longer, but they found
[01:09:29.040 --> 01:09:34.640]  that when they fed it to mice, it caused mutations in the mice. But they said, we're going to go ahead
[01:09:34.640 --> 01:09:40.320]  and go forward with this. That's just one example. Do you know what happens if you splice the DNA of
[01:09:40.320 --> 01:09:48.880]  two men together, two mammals? I mean, I've done the research. They know for a fact what happens,
[01:09:48.880 --> 01:09:53.600]  and they're having to go in and basically turn off a bunch of other genes and then design this
[01:09:53.600 --> 01:09:58.320]  humanoid to be what they want, because it's not a human. When you cross two males together,
[01:09:58.880 --> 01:10:06.320]  what happens? There is a genetic line that is a complete other genetic DNA sequence
[01:10:06.320 --> 01:10:15.200]  that is only carried by women and is only transferred into the new human by a man and a woman,
[01:10:16.560 --> 01:10:20.960]  and they admit this and they're saying, well, we'll choose the mitochondrial DNA line and we'll
[01:10:20.960 --> 01:10:29.520]  inject it. Folks, when they, going back 30, 40 years, would just take one GMO species and maybe
[01:10:29.520 --> 01:10:34.720]  change one trait, they would start getting really bad mutations. When you change six, seven, eight,
[01:10:34.720 --> 01:10:41.760]  nine, 10 of them, things get really hairy. And by hairy, in every mammal species, when you just feed
[01:10:41.760 --> 01:10:51.440]  them GMO crops, where they put other organisms in it, you get genetic leakage of that DNA and even
[01:10:51.440 --> 01:10:58.240]  RNA and viruses that we could never get sick from. Zoological viruses, zoological bacterium that don't
[01:10:58.240 --> 01:11:04.880]  really hurt humans, those are now jumping species. And I could go on for hours. It's the top link
[01:11:04.880 --> 01:11:13.520]  on Drudge on the top stories on M4 Wars as well. Baby with three parents, birth of a new era,
[01:11:14.560 --> 01:11:19.440]  we're going to be getting to that coming up. And they sell it in Time Magazine, like, oh,
[01:11:19.440 --> 01:11:26.320]  it's this wonderful, wonderful, you know, happy, great thing. And it's just crazy how far all
[01:11:26.320 --> 01:11:31.360]  this is gone. And this is worried about rise of the robots. What about, you think they put back
[01:11:31.360 --> 01:11:34.720]  doors in your iPhone? You think they put back doors in the chips? You think they manipulate
[01:11:34.720 --> 01:11:41.120]  things for social engineering? This is all about eugenics, all about control. And you've got such
[01:11:41.120 --> 01:11:46.480]  a sick, weird population. It's all into how they look. And so you can just imagine what people
[01:11:46.480 --> 01:11:50.800]  are going to want for their kids. I want my son to win all the basketball games. I want to be
[01:11:50.800 --> 01:11:58.800]  seven feet tall and have, you know, double Y or whatever. And just the power this gives the state
[01:11:58.800 --> 01:12:08.320]  to decide who can do this. The ramifications are just mind blowing, mind boggling. But don't worry,
[01:12:08.320 --> 01:12:14.960]  Monsanto applies the rights to CRISPR. And what's CRISPR? The US Agribusiness Secures a Global
[01:12:14.960 --> 01:12:22.160]  Non-Exclusive Licensing Agreement from the Broad Institute to use the Gene Editing Technology
[01:12:22.160 --> 01:12:26.400]  for agricultural applications. I love how we pay for this, especially the eugenics-based Cold
[01:12:26.400 --> 01:12:33.040]  Springs Harbor. And then Monsanto, if any company is run by Satan, that's it. They say they're
[01:12:33.040 --> 01:12:36.880]  getting non-exclusive, but then they're going to make sub patents on what they produce with it. And
[01:12:36.880 --> 01:12:42.480]  then they admit their plan is to have a patent on all life and not let any animal or plant on
[01:12:42.480 --> 01:12:48.400]  earth reproduce without going through their system. And of course, that is the big enchilada.
[01:12:48.400 --> 01:12:52.800]  They don't want you to be able to have children without it being artificially controlled. That's
[01:12:52.800 --> 01:12:58.480]  why they admitted the goal 30 years ago was to have basically all births by 2025 be cesarean.
[01:12:58.480 --> 01:13:03.600]  They're already up to 60% in Austin, Texas, which leads the country last time I read in cesareans.
[01:13:04.160 --> 01:13:11.760]  And they've got a scam they run. I mean, folks, it's on. Okay. It's on. You think, well,
[01:13:11.760 --> 01:13:16.880]  the average nurse or doctor is not part of it. No, they just follow the guidelines of their guilt
[01:13:16.880 --> 01:13:22.640]  or they get removed. And if they tell them they want 100% cesarean, they're going to do it.
[01:13:24.320 --> 01:13:29.040]  And I'm telling you, look at the point where people say, in the past, we were grown in our
[01:13:29.040 --> 01:13:33.920]  mothers. Mothers, mother is a sexist term, not allowed. You think I'm joking. I said this 10
[01:13:33.920 --> 01:13:37.680]  years ago. Now I'm saying mother and father is sexist. Mother and father is evil. Don't have it
[01:13:37.680 --> 01:13:41.280]  on entrance papers. Don't, because someone may not have a mother and father. How do I know that
[01:13:41.280 --> 01:13:47.360]  years before they started doing it? Because they said their goal is an asexual four foot tall
[01:13:47.360 --> 01:13:53.440]  creature. If they even want those around, that goes around servicing things for them,
[01:13:53.440 --> 01:13:58.960]  and then the ruling elite, which are a new species, this is admitted, will basically rule over the
[01:13:58.960 --> 01:14:04.880]  sub-oids that look like dwarf clowns. And I don't know, that's their plan. It's been in mainstream
[01:14:04.880 --> 01:14:09.680]  news. I remember reading about it from H.G. Wells, of course, Aldous Huxley. He wrote about it in
[01:14:09.680 --> 01:14:13.840]  1932, Brave New World, and he gave a speech before he died in 62 at Berkeley saying, this isn't a
[01:14:13.840 --> 01:14:19.520]  joke. I'm from an elite family, a secret breeding program, and this is, this is our real plan.
[01:14:21.680 --> 01:14:26.400]  And it's the real plan. So you want to be a three and a half, four foot tall, you know, drilling
[01:14:26.400 --> 01:14:31.120]  clown creature, you're like, that's not going to happen. Look at everything they do. They want
[01:14:31.120 --> 01:14:38.080]  abominations. They want to make humans fall. The elite do. They, who are hunchback goblins themselves,
[01:14:38.080 --> 01:14:42.720]  I mean, look at Marilyn Albright, look at Hillary Clinton. They rise up to be the big six foot five
[01:14:42.720 --> 01:14:48.720]  beautiful person. You become the goblin creature. And by the way, they'll make fun of this in
[01:14:48.720 --> 01:14:53.920]  national news. I know they will Google elite believers splitting into two species. And then it
[01:14:53.920 --> 01:14:59.760]  shows in ClickWeb, because it'll be older articles, and this is their plan. The Morlocks don't like
[01:14:59.760 --> 01:15:05.680]  the Eloi. So we're going to get to Dr. Grip in a moment with that information and get his take on
[01:15:05.680 --> 01:15:12.880]  all this. But before we do, there are a bunch of these clips. He wrote about it in the book in 2004,
[01:15:12.880 --> 01:15:17.280]  but I remember 2003, Trump being criticized for saying, I don't know, this is a good idea.
[01:15:18.080 --> 01:15:24.240]  Now we've dug around stuff back then is harder to find. But we did find one from right as the
[01:15:24.240 --> 01:15:27.440]  invasion was about to happen saying he doesn't know if it's a good idea. Doesn't think it is.
[01:15:28.400 --> 01:15:33.280]  This is him calling into Fox news. Now remember Lester Holt, when he said, you know,
[01:15:33.280 --> 01:15:37.280]  Lester Holt said you were not because he's God. He's the fact checker. Hell, he ought to be president.
[01:15:37.920 --> 01:15:41.040]  He's the guy with the earpiece in his ear. He's long getting the signals from Hillary.
[01:15:44.400 --> 01:15:56.160]  Baseball. I mean, it was really, really bad. So that went on and on. And then we ought to
[01:15:56.160 --> 01:15:59.520]  find the clip of this and put it together. And then Trump's like, yeah, I was against it. No,
[01:15:59.520 --> 01:16:05.120]  you were not. I'm Lester Holt. I'm God. No, you were not. I'm Lester Holt. I speak with Lordy.
[01:16:05.120 --> 01:16:12.640]  Obamacare is free. There are no penalties. Associated press Americans paid. How many
[01:16:12.640 --> 01:16:16.880]  billion 1.7 billion in the first year of Obamacare in penalties, the IRS.
[01:16:19.360 --> 01:16:23.680]  The unit in going to take over Washington post you in to run our police.
[01:16:23.680 --> 01:16:29.920]  The U.S. should pay reparations to black people. When the U.N.'s mowing blocks down as we speak all
[01:16:29.920 --> 01:16:34.640]  over Africa. I mean, this is crazy. But let's go to Donald J. Trump here at us.
[01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:39.600]  And to sort of break down for the president, if you were advising him how much time you commit
[01:16:39.600 --> 01:16:42.960]  to Iraq versus how much time you commit to the economy, what would you say?
[01:16:43.760 --> 01:16:47.760]  Well, I'm starting to think that people are much more focused now on the economy. They're
[01:16:47.760 --> 01:16:52.880]  getting a little bit tired of, you know, hearing we're going in. We're not going in. You know,
[01:16:52.880 --> 01:16:57.280]  whatever happened to the days of Douglas MacArthur, I mean, he'd go and attack. He wouldn't talk. I
[01:16:57.280 --> 01:17:01.360]  mean, we have to, you know, it's sort of like either do it or don't do it.
[01:17:01.360 --> 01:17:05.680]  You're saying the leash on this is getting kind of short here that the president has got to do
[01:17:05.680 --> 01:17:10.480]  something presumably sooner rather than later and stringing this along could ultimately hurt us.
[01:17:10.480 --> 01:17:13.200]  Well, he's either got to do something or not do something. Yeah.
[01:17:13.200 --> 01:17:17.680]  Perhaps because perhaps he shouldn't be doing it yet. And perhaps we should be waiting for the
[01:17:17.680 --> 01:17:23.360]  United Nations. You know, he's under a lot of pressure. He's, you know, I think he's doing a
[01:17:23.360 --> 01:17:27.520]  very good job. But of course, if you look at the polls, a lot of people are getting a little tired.
[01:17:27.520 --> 01:17:32.240]  I think the Iraqi situation is a problem. And I think the economy is a much bigger problem.
[01:17:33.440 --> 01:17:37.520]  Which is what he always said. Folks in the economy don't start wars that now have cost us
[01:17:37.520 --> 01:17:41.120]  six trillion dollars. Now, I'm going to skip this break. So we have more time. We're going
[01:17:41.120 --> 01:17:44.800]  to Dr. Ribb here in just a moment to get into all this breaking medical news before I go any
[01:17:44.800 --> 01:17:52.240]  further. Let's play some more clips. This is some of the people that work for Obama making jokes
[01:17:53.920 --> 01:17:56.640]  basically about the American people. Let's play that clip.
[01:17:56.640 --> 01:18:01.280]  The point is that you have equal impact on serious speeches because it's about style,
[01:18:01.280 --> 01:18:08.480]  use of language, etc. I really like I was very the joke speech is the most fun part of this.
[01:18:08.480 --> 01:18:15.280]  But the things I'm the most proud of were the more serious speeches. I think health care, economic
[01:18:15.280 --> 01:18:20.240]  speeches, and I think I love it. What the line about if you like your insurance, you can keep it.
[01:18:28.720 --> 01:18:32.400]  Yeah. And we have Gruber laughing about thank God the American people have no attention span
[01:18:32.400 --> 01:18:37.440]  or dumb. Of all the professors. Yeah, we feed on them. And then we've got the head of the State
[01:18:37.440 --> 01:18:45.840]  Department spokesperson going, Oh, God, we lied everyone. It's so funny. Oh, it's good. And then
[01:18:45.840 --> 01:18:50.080]  if they don't like it, we just call them racist. Whether they don't like that, we just shut Michael
[01:18:50.080 --> 01:18:54.000]  Savage off the radio and now they're openly saying they want to shut us down. Hillary puts out a
[01:18:54.000 --> 01:19:01.840]  fundraiser saying shut down the alt right. Let's ban the word mother and father haha. It's so much fun.
[01:19:01.840 --> 01:19:09.520]  Now, let's go to Dr. Group. Again, the Global Healing Center, Patriot veteran, great guy helped us
[01:19:09.520 --> 01:19:14.640]  develop many of the different circles. We have it in FullWarsLife.com. I wanted to get him on a
[01:19:14.640 --> 01:19:20.400]  host of issues today. By the way, we were conspiracy theorist again. National News attacked me a few
[01:19:20.400 --> 01:19:25.840]  years ago saying that I claimed with no evidence that leprosy was coming back in the US, but you
[01:19:25.840 --> 01:19:30.880]  could go to the CDC and see the numbers were 10 times more what they were in many states than
[01:19:30.880 --> 01:19:35.760]  they were ever in our modern history. And I told you, I talked to health department folks about
[01:19:35.760 --> 01:19:41.200]  all the leprosy they're doing within Florida and in Texas and in California. Wet leprosy,
[01:19:41.200 --> 01:19:44.560]  the type that spreads and TB is exploding everywhere, but that Obama doesn't even do
[01:19:44.560 --> 01:19:48.880]  medical checks at the border. We've actually interviewed the board patrol union at the Texas
[01:19:48.880 --> 01:19:57.840]  border saying black plague, syphilis, drug resistant TB, everything's coming across. And so now it's
[01:19:57.840 --> 01:20:04.880]  been confirmed. All those cases of leprosy in the California schools, it's been confirmed. Let's put
[01:20:04.880 --> 01:20:09.440]  that on screen for TB viewers, for radio listeners, I'll read to you. International business times,
[01:20:09.440 --> 01:20:14.240]  leprosy cases confirmed in Southern California elementary school. And there is no cure,
[01:20:15.280 --> 01:20:19.040]  but they can stop the spreads, your daughter's nose and everything that wrought off too quickly
[01:20:19.040 --> 01:20:24.240]  with super strong antibiotics. And I've got articles here about flesh eating bacteria,
[01:20:24.240 --> 01:20:30.480]  multi 20,000 plus percent increases, just mass death all over the place. But when you get eaten
[01:20:30.480 --> 01:20:35.920]  to death by that, which literally 30, 40, 50 times, depending on what state you're in,
[01:20:35.920 --> 01:20:40.480]  chance of being killed by flesh eating bacteria, they call it an infection, non-treatable infection,
[01:20:41.200 --> 01:20:46.560]  then buy a gun, but it's okay. Don't worry, everything's fine. The Hollywood reporter says
[01:20:46.560 --> 01:20:50.560]  the elite are buying bunkers and fleeing to New Zealand. You're like, I heard that before. Of
[01:20:50.560 --> 01:20:57.120]  course you did, heard it here, but now it's all coming out. So Dr. Group, thank you so much for
[01:20:57.120 --> 01:21:03.760]  joining us with us for the balance of the hour, so much to get into, so much to cover. I mean,
[01:21:03.760 --> 01:21:08.160]  I got to tell you, I keep saying this, but every day becomes more real. Everything we've warned
[01:21:08.160 --> 01:21:11.840]  about, everything we've talked about that we knew was already true, we have the documentation for,
[01:21:12.880 --> 01:21:17.520]  is now out in the open. You were writing 10 years ago, first person I saw doing it,
[01:21:17.520 --> 01:21:22.160]  about studies out there, that if you don't have good flora in your gut, it's linked to cancer
[01:21:22.160 --> 01:21:26.560]  and autoimmune disorders. That was even in the New York Times and Wall Street Journal a few
[01:21:26.560 --> 01:21:32.080]  months ago. They said, wow, the gut, the gut, having bad gut flora may be the leading cause of
[01:21:32.080 --> 01:21:37.200]  cancer and the leading cause of autoimmune disorders. Oh wow, look at that. I mean, they knew
[01:21:37.200 --> 01:21:41.600]  all along. Bill and Melinda Gates were spending billions of years just studying gut flora.
[01:21:41.600 --> 01:21:45.600]  They know exactly what they're doing with the Monsanto, BT corn, the rest of it. I mean,
[01:21:45.600 --> 01:21:50.800]  this is a diabolical plan. They admit it's a diabolical plan. And here we are in the middle
[01:21:50.800 --> 01:21:55.200]  of it. But what happens is our credibility explodes, is your credibility explodes, as there's
[01:21:55.200 --> 01:22:00.240]  implodes. And as they figure that out, that we're bigger. Info is way bigger than CNN. We're just
[01:22:00.240 --> 01:22:05.680]  one little outlet of liberty. What are they going to do as they panic and realize some young
[01:22:05.680 --> 01:22:11.440]  conservative woman can have 63 million views per video. What happens as they realize that they are
[01:22:11.440 --> 01:22:19.360]  the ones that are the emperor wearing no clothes? Well, I mean, we have been talking about that
[01:22:19.360 --> 01:22:25.920]  for a long time. And I think back to close to 20 years ago when I devoted my life to finding the
[01:22:25.920 --> 01:22:33.120]  root cause of all disease. And if you kind of think of it in a way like they have an army,
[01:22:33.120 --> 01:22:38.720]  the globalists, and their army is a combination of genetically modified foods, fluoride in the water,
[01:22:38.720 --> 01:22:43.760]  chlorine, and the list goes on and on and on the million difference of toxins that they expose us
[01:22:43.760 --> 01:22:49.600]  to on a regular basis. And by the way, this is all planned. And then we have an army. The thing is,
[01:22:49.600 --> 01:22:56.480]  they know what our army is. Most of us don't know what their army is. So we have an army
[01:22:57.440 --> 01:23:03.760]  of gut microbiome. And that's, that's our army. I mean, it's now been proven. And I wrote a book
[01:23:03.760 --> 01:23:10.560]  probably 15 years ago called health begins in the colon and disease also begins in the colon and
[01:23:10.560 --> 01:23:18.480]  the intestinal tract because we have this massive three pounds of good probiotic, good flora that's
[01:23:18.480 --> 01:23:24.960]  supposed to protect us. That's our army. How are we going to fight an army of a million chemicals
[01:23:24.960 --> 01:23:31.360]  and toxins coming into our system that are specifically designed to kill off our army? It'd
[01:23:31.360 --> 01:23:38.640]  be like their army has laser guns and machine guns and our army has butter knives. It just doesn't
[01:23:38.640 --> 01:23:45.280]  work. So that's why for all these years, I've been promoting gut health, gut health, gut health.
[01:23:45.280 --> 01:23:51.600]  The thing is over our lifetime, we only have two exposure points. We have two ways to get
[01:23:51.600 --> 01:23:57.040]  probiotics in our system. The first one, which you were talking about with the C sections and all the
[01:23:57.040 --> 01:24:03.680]  medical promotions of don't breastfeed. Don't engage in conspiracy theory.
[01:24:04.480 --> 01:24:09.440]  Women saying the word woman is a gender term and it's hurtful. So that gender doesn't exist.
[01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:16.800]  Okay. First, and breastfeeding never existed and vaginal birth never existed. So stop being
[01:24:16.800 --> 01:24:22.720]  a conspiracy theorist. Well, what I'm saying is we only have two ways to get probiotics. One
[01:24:22.720 --> 01:24:29.120]  dirt from breast milk and that's the most important, the most important thing we can do to set the stage
[01:24:29.120 --> 01:24:35.760]  for health in our body. The second is through eating foods that we consume. Now we've gotten away
[01:24:35.760 --> 01:24:41.120]  and we've gone to manmade foods and that was instituted on purpose as well. Now some people
[01:24:41.120 --> 01:24:45.440]  are eating organic foods, which is great, but that's the only way that we're going to get probiotics.
[01:24:45.440 --> 01:24:50.480]  All these people out here talk about eating yogurt, but think about it. You make yogurt with
[01:24:50.480 --> 01:24:56.800]  pasteurized milk. Okay. It's, it's chemical written in there with artificial sweeteners and
[01:24:56.800 --> 01:25:02.640]  everything else, but probiotics are actually bacteria that live all over the body that people
[01:25:02.640 --> 01:25:06.800]  just think they're in the intestinal lining, but they're not. They're on your skin. Good probiotics
[01:25:06.800 --> 01:25:12.240]  are on your skin. That's why using all these antibacterial soaps. I learned when I was a teenager
[01:25:12.240 --> 01:25:17.040]  that after football practice, if I scrub my face with soap, even the fancy ones that were more
[01:25:17.040 --> 01:25:22.560]  organic, that's when I would get zits and break out. But if I just, you know, use light shampoo,
[01:25:22.560 --> 01:25:27.280]  clean under my arms and stuff, but didn't take the oil off my face, I didn't have zits and all the
[01:25:27.280 --> 01:25:34.080]  other young people did. Right. So everything by design is designed to kill off not only the
[01:25:34.080 --> 01:25:38.640]  probiotics in your gut, but the vaginal probiotics. Here's an example. Here's an example. Last week,
[01:25:38.640 --> 01:25:43.600]  I had a pen burst while I was on air. We had to go to a tape for about five minutes. I got it
[01:25:43.600 --> 01:25:47.280]  burst in my hand. I rubbed my face, not seeing it. I had black all over the side of my nose down
[01:25:47.280 --> 01:25:52.080]  my face here. I had to go in the bathroom, get soap, wash it off. I never washed my face with soap.
[01:25:52.640 --> 01:25:59.440]  And boom, I got huge zits that I hadn't had since I was like 13 years old, all down where the ink was
[01:25:59.440 --> 01:26:05.040]  because I guess the ink was toxic, but also the soap scrub it off because it took a lot of it.
[01:26:05.040 --> 01:26:10.320]  Again, killed my good bacteria. So that's another reason why we have such a problem with
[01:26:10.320 --> 01:26:16.640]  antibacterials these days is because our good bacteria is being affected by it as well. And
[01:26:16.640 --> 01:26:21.440]  you have probiotics in the urinary tract. You have them in the respiratory system that are
[01:26:21.440 --> 01:26:26.880]  being killed off by all the chemicals in the air. So it really is an attack on our probiotics or
[01:26:26.880 --> 01:26:33.280]  our good microorganisms or our army that's there to protect us. The collection of probiotics
[01:26:33.280 --> 01:26:38.880]  concentrated in the gut, like we were talking about earlier is called the microbiome. And
[01:26:38.880 --> 01:26:45.680]  believe it or not, it actually has 20 times more genetic material than we do. And it's like a
[01:26:45.680 --> 01:26:51.520]  fingerprint. It's each person's identification. It's different on each individual person.
[01:26:51.520 --> 01:26:58.480]  And the probiotics that we have in our body outnumber ourselves 10 to 1. So picture that.
[01:26:58.480 --> 01:27:06.160]  You have 10 times as many- And so we eat pesticide-laden food, fluoride, garbage, bad bacteria, GMO
[01:27:06.160 --> 01:27:11.120]  bacteria, all the different herbicides that are bio-cumulated the foods. And I've been reading
[01:27:11.120 --> 01:27:15.760]  studies that some people that are 60, 70, 80 basically have nothing in their gut. It's just
[01:27:15.760 --> 01:27:20.720]  dead or it's full of all these bad yeast, which again, we showed mainstream news earlier, scientific
[01:27:20.720 --> 01:27:25.760]  American others. Mental health may depend on creatures in the gut. Even the New York Times
[01:27:25.760 --> 01:27:31.040]  was admitting major studies, massive cancer linked to not having good probiotics in the gut.
[01:27:31.040 --> 01:27:33.680]  And that's why I'm going to go ahead and plug right now because I want to get into
[01:27:33.680 --> 01:27:38.000]  genetically engineered babies after the break. We have a new probiotic, seven years of making
[01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:41.680]  my doctor group. I kept going to him and saying, which of these companies should I use with, you
[01:27:41.680 --> 01:27:45.520]  know, there's hundreds of great probiotics. He said, I'm waiting with these top firms
[01:27:45.520 --> 01:27:50.160]  to get the very best grains and put out the best. So I waited. He's brought it out for us,
[01:27:50.160 --> 01:27:55.760]  probiotic, biome defense, 50 billion live and active cultures. Dr. Group talk about this.
[01:27:55.760 --> 01:28:01.040]  It's available at infowarslife.com at the factory. It's made in the cold. It's kept in a big
[01:28:01.040 --> 01:28:05.360]  refrigeration system here. It shipped to you with an ice pack. Now, if it gets warm, it still keeps
[01:28:05.360 --> 01:28:09.600]  a lot of its activities, but you want to keep it cool for maximum effect. Put it in your refrigerator,
[01:28:09.600 --> 01:28:15.040]  take it daily. We're showing people video on prisonplanet.tv and folks watching the live streams
[01:28:15.040 --> 01:28:21.520]  of our cold room. And this is again, the Rolls Royce at a cost almost half of what leading
[01:28:21.520 --> 01:28:24.960]  competitors are for something of this quality described by this is so special.
[01:28:26.240 --> 01:28:30.880]  The reason why it took me so long to develop this product is because I wanted to really
[01:28:30.880 --> 01:28:36.880]  get a lot of research done on what are the best strains to put in the body. Once I found that,
[01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:44.560]  I started contacting the probiotic culture in companies. There's about four big companies,
[01:28:44.560 --> 01:28:49.760]  and those are the companies that every single probiotic supplement on the market uses to
[01:28:49.760 --> 01:28:54.560]  culture them. So when I went to these companies originally and I said, how do you make these
[01:28:54.560 --> 01:29:01.120]  probiotics? I want a vegetarian, vegan based probiotic. I want non GMO. I want, I don't want
[01:29:01.120 --> 01:29:06.160]  any of these toxic fillers and excipients because most of the capsules, all these probiotics you
[01:29:06.160 --> 01:29:12.160]  see in the grocery store or the vitamin shops or anything, there's only probably 10 or 15 milligrams
[01:29:12.160 --> 01:29:20.240]  and these capsules hold 750 milligrams. Most of them only contain about 15 or 20 milligrams of the
[01:29:20.240 --> 01:29:26.000]  actual probiotic itself. The other part of the capsule is nothing but filler. And so when I
[01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:29.360]  contacted all these companies and asked them, well, what are you using? Let's break it down
[01:29:29.360 --> 01:29:33.760]  because this is important folks. I mean, we guarantee we work the hardest to bring you what
[01:29:33.760 --> 01:29:37.520]  we're personally are using. This is what my children take what I take. It's so incredibly
[01:29:37.520 --> 01:29:41.840]  important and it funds the operation. It's a 360 win. Stay with us. We'll be back with this,
[01:29:41.840 --> 01:29:55.360]  the designer babies in more. We're on the March, the empires on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN
[01:29:55.360 --> 01:30:04.560]  radio network. New information is coming forth about the terrorist Omar Mateen who killed 49
[01:30:04.560 --> 01:30:10.080]  people and wounded 53 others in the gay Orlando nightclub attack, a transcript of the conversation
[01:30:10.080 --> 01:30:14.480]  between Mateen and the police negotiator has been released and it sheds new light on Mateen's
[01:30:14.480 --> 01:30:18.960]  motivation for the murders. Mateen was triggered by a Pentagon drone strike a month before the
[01:30:18.960 --> 01:30:24.320]  attack. He told the negotiator saying quote, yo, the airstrike that killed Abu Wahid a few weeks
[01:30:24.320 --> 01:30:29.120]  ago. That's what triggered it. Okay, they should not have bombed and killed Abu Wahid. He also
[01:30:29.120 --> 01:30:34.800]  identifies himself as a follower of ISIS. Now initial reports from several news outlets reported
[01:30:34.800 --> 01:30:40.320]  Mateen had described himself as gay, but he was a homophobe and a white feeder despite him making
[01:30:40.320 --> 01:30:44.560]  claims that he belonged to ISIS. The New York Times stated three days after the massacre that
[01:30:44.560 --> 01:30:49.680]  quote, the precise motivation of Mateen remains unclear. Now the false narrative was perpetuated
[01:30:49.680 --> 01:30:54.240]  for a week. The president himself attempting to paint Omar Mateen as a lone wolf shooter,
[01:30:54.240 --> 01:31:08.160]  anything responsible that radical Islam. I'm Margaret Hell reporting for info wars.com.

[01:32:14.080 --> 01:32:19.360]  this country. Obesity, diabetes, cancer, heart disease and autoimmune illnesses are rampant.
[01:32:19.360 --> 01:32:23.040]  One out of three or four people is dealing with some kind of health challenge and everyone knows

[01:33:37.520 --> 01:33:41.360]  I'm going to talk about this CRISPR system. I've mentioned it some but basically it's a
[01:33:41.360 --> 01:33:45.680]  computerized life system. It's very inexpensive now and can be deployed all over the world.
[01:33:45.680 --> 01:33:51.760]  They're going to cut out pieces of DNA that you want to replace whether it's for having spiritual
[01:33:51.760 --> 01:33:58.400]  connections, having a higher consciousness that's been proven to be on the DNA, to have a proclivity
[01:33:58.400 --> 01:34:04.480]  to be angry, to want to oppose illegitimate authority. Clearly this will be for social
[01:34:04.480 --> 01:34:10.080]  engineering but they're saying, oh, we'll cut out the cancer genes. We'll cut out the depression
[01:34:10.080 --> 01:34:16.640]  genes just like they've got vaccines. They're quote already developed that will end mental illness or
[01:34:16.640 --> 01:34:22.640]  will end paranoia or will end stress. And then you read it's a virus that goes in and literally
[01:34:22.640 --> 01:34:28.720]  eats certain areas of neuro receptors that are also associated with enlightenment, spiritual
[01:34:29.520 --> 01:34:35.680]  feelings, those highs and those lows, your conscience. So they're trying to dehumanize us.
[01:34:35.680 --> 01:34:39.680]  We'll talk about that in a few minutes. And again, this isn't science fiction. I've told
[01:34:39.680 --> 01:34:47.360]  the story many times of about 14 and a half years ago. Going in to pick up a pizza to take it home
[01:34:47.360 --> 01:34:56.400]  to the family. My wife then was pregnant with the son and a guy going, hey, you're lying about
[01:34:56.400 --> 01:35:00.960]  spiders being crossed with goats. I heard you on the radio and I used to like your liar.
[01:35:01.680 --> 01:35:04.960]  And I went, let me guess you, would you go to biology, you know, 20 years ago and he was,
[01:35:04.960 --> 01:35:09.600]  I went to UT in 1973. That's right. How did you know that? And I went, well, I've run into this
[01:35:09.600 --> 01:35:15.040]  before I said it's in the news that they've got goats that are part spider that create body armor
[01:35:15.040 --> 01:35:20.000]  out of their milk. I'm not lying. He's already going, man, I was like, dude, you're, let's just get
[01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:24.800]  out of my face. And I told that story that night I was on the radio back then I was still on the
[01:35:24.800 --> 01:35:31.760]  radio at night as well. Well, that had been in 100 newspapers then now it's been in thousands.
[01:35:31.760 --> 01:35:36.720]  There it is on screen, the goats with spider genes and silk in their milk, but they count on the
[01:35:36.720 --> 01:35:43.760]  public being ignorant. They count on the public not understanding what's going on with weird
[01:35:43.760 --> 01:35:48.560]  light years ahead of this. Ladies and gentlemen, we're light years ahead of this.
[01:35:51.600 --> 01:35:56.880]  And you talk about humanity getting Promethean fire or that Atlantean moment when we get something
[01:35:56.880 --> 01:36:03.120]  so high tech, it's beyond us and it, you know, basically destroys our civilization. We're here.
[01:36:05.360 --> 01:36:10.560]  The Genesis engine. We now have the power to quickly and easily alter DNA. It could eliminate
[01:36:10.560 --> 01:36:14.720]  diseases. It could solve world hunger. It could provide unlimited clean energy. It could really
[01:36:14.720 --> 01:36:21.440]  get out of hand by Amy Waxman. It's already gotten out of hand. Ladies and gentlemen, they have
[01:36:21.440 --> 01:36:27.840]  declassified that they had humanoid clones 35 years ago and now they're announcing they're
[01:36:27.840 --> 01:36:31.520]  going to start rolling them out for you. You're not going to see all the mistakes, the mutations,
[01:36:31.520 --> 01:36:36.000]  the creatures that should have rights, but didn't because they weren't animal. They weren't human.
[01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:42.800]  They were in the phantom zone. Dr. Group is our guest. I really appreciate him joining us and
[01:36:42.800 --> 01:36:48.720]  going over to this, but speaking of protecting your gut, we promote things that we know you need
[01:36:48.720 --> 01:36:54.000]  like gravity-fed water filtration systems that reduce or completely cut out hundreds and hundreds
[01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:59.120]  of different chemicals. Some things they totally cut out. Some things it's like 99.999. You don't
[01:36:59.120 --> 01:37:01.920]  want to drink glyphosate. You don't want to drink fluoride. You don't want to drink, you know,
[01:37:01.920 --> 01:37:06.720]  the bisphenol A. I can go on for hours with the stuff. The average water supply has over 300
[01:37:06.720 --> 01:37:10.560]  different contaminants in it. Well water, you name it. We sell the electropure, the pro pure.
[01:37:10.560 --> 01:37:14.560]  They're all great systems that basically cut everything out or bring it down to almost
[01:37:14.560 --> 01:37:20.720]  non-techable levels and it funds our operation. Same thing with biome, defense, probiotic,
[01:37:20.720 --> 01:37:27.280]  60 vegetarian capsules. He was getting into how the others are basically fillers and or are lazily
[01:37:27.280 --> 01:37:32.720]  just a few basic strains. Group, the reason I'm with group is he was known by the different
[01:37:34.800 --> 01:37:38.960]  supplement and health Nazi sites and I mean that in a sign-filled way by the real connoisseurs,
[01:37:38.960 --> 01:37:44.880]  the real, you know, the real cutting edge people as the guy that doesn't cut corners and I want to
[01:37:44.880 --> 01:37:48.400]  have great products but also I don't want the FDA to be able to come after me. I want to be able
[01:37:48.400 --> 01:37:54.000]  to follow all the rules of the very safest, most tested stuff and so and I've used two other big
[01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:57.360]  companies as well that are also known for being great but group has about half our products.
[01:37:57.360 --> 01:38:02.800]  He also advises us on the others and sometimes he can't put something out just because his standards
[01:38:02.800 --> 01:38:06.480]  are so high and I go, you know what? We're going to be a half inch lower than you and I've got to
[01:38:06.480 --> 01:38:09.840]  put this out. This is important, you know, and so the something that we put out, he's like,
[01:38:09.840 --> 01:38:13.680]  yeah, it's overall really good but I, you know, I'd put that out and we could actually find a
[01:38:13.680 --> 01:38:17.520]  clean source of this and I'm just like, clean, your stuff's cleaner than the air, man. I'm just
[01:38:17.520 --> 01:38:21.200]  being honest about group. That's how good he is. He's over there smiling. You know, we've had these
[01:38:21.200 --> 01:38:26.160]  arguments, believe me. So the point is I kept saying like a year ago, I'm going to come out with a
[01:38:26.160 --> 01:38:30.320]  probiotic. I can private label that's good. This is a huge market. I'm already taking probiotics.
[01:38:30.320 --> 01:38:34.480]  I'm sure yours is going to be the best but I really want that probiotic. He finally did it.
[01:38:34.480 --> 01:38:40.800]  He finally did it. Biome defense. Why is this the best? You were getting into the fact that it
[01:38:40.800 --> 01:38:45.680]  doesn't have all this garbage filler in it and why it's such a game changer at infowarslife.com.
[01:38:46.800 --> 01:38:51.520]  Right. So it's an interesting story because it took such a long time to try to convince.
[01:38:51.520 --> 01:38:56.000]  First of all, three of the big companies that produced the probiotics basically laughed in
[01:38:56.000 --> 01:39:01.600]  my face and hung up the phone. I had to convince, one of them was actually interested in listening
[01:39:01.600 --> 01:39:06.880]  to me and I actually talked to their main scientists and after months of collaboration,
[01:39:06.880 --> 01:39:12.720]  I'm telling him that I want the strongest probiotic out there. I want these unique strains in it.
[01:39:12.720 --> 01:39:16.560]  I want it cultured and vegetarian vegan. I don't want it cultured in
[01:39:17.200 --> 01:39:22.800]  gelatin from cows from slaughterhouses. They basically had to change their whole procedure.
[01:39:22.800 --> 01:39:26.640]  I had to guarantee them that I was going to purchase enough so they could actually do the
[01:39:26.640 --> 01:39:30.240]  R&D. And again, you don't want to grow this in gelatin that's bone and cartilage material
[01:39:30.240 --> 01:39:34.640]  because that's where the pry on top garbage is. And that's why neurological disorders,
[01:39:34.640 --> 01:39:38.880]  I mean, I know so many people who have 30, 40 year old members of their family that are now
[01:39:38.880 --> 01:39:44.080]  having quote Parkinson's. And it's because let's just be honest about it, mad cow type spectrum
[01:39:44.080 --> 01:39:50.080]  garbage is everywhere. People go ahead. Well, yeah, you have most people have no clue how probiotics
[01:39:50.080 --> 01:39:54.960]  are made or how their culture and I got deep into the research and development on this.
[01:39:54.960 --> 01:39:59.040]  They basically thought I was crazy. The president of the company got on the phone with me and they
[01:39:59.040 --> 01:40:03.280]  said, do you understand what you're doing? You're like changing this whole field. And I said,
[01:40:03.280 --> 01:40:07.600]  this is the way the field is going to go anyway. Either you're you're with me or you're without
[01:40:07.600 --> 01:40:12.400]  me. I'll find a way to do it anyway. So finally, we had to go through probably a couple years of
[01:40:12.400 --> 01:40:16.320]  research and development. And by the way, let's toot your horn, but you also been going to Germany
[01:40:16.320 --> 01:40:20.400]  and going to France and going to other places. This is where it's already going in the high tech
[01:40:20.400 --> 01:40:24.480]  clinics. You get it by prescription. It's already basically gone to what we're doing,
[01:40:24.480 --> 01:40:28.720]  but to the general public. And I even forgot that. I mean, the reality of this is 10 times
[01:40:28.720 --> 01:40:33.040]  cooler than I'm even saying. I mean, when we say seven years, you've been doing this for two years
[01:40:33.040 --> 01:40:38.000]  before you were working with us. I mean, you've finally done it. Go ahead. Yes, exactly. And
[01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:43.440]  it's still to this day, we are the only ones in the world right now that have this unique technique.
[01:40:43.440 --> 01:40:49.680]  I mean, they also say, are you crazy? This thing's going to be so expensive. No one's ever asked for
[01:40:49.680 --> 01:40:55.520]  this quality in this many strains in one probiotic formula before. So long story short, we actually
[01:40:55.520 --> 01:41:00.480]  got it done and we got it done using a certified organic ingredients. All the other probiotics
[01:41:00.480 --> 01:41:07.120]  out there are filled with silicon dioxide, GMO, by the way, maltodextrin. And now we have proof
[01:41:07.120 --> 01:41:15.040]  that genetically modified foods actually change the flora in your gut to produce glyphosate.
[01:41:15.040 --> 01:41:20.880]  Well, what is glyphosate? Glyphosate is a pesticide. What do pesticides do? They kill off
[01:41:20.880 --> 01:41:26.480]  organisms. They kill off bacteria. So it's a revolving cycle, a revolving door. We chose
[01:41:26.480 --> 01:41:33.520]  stuff like bifidobacterium lactus, which has the ability to protect your cells and your digestive
[01:41:33.520 --> 01:41:36.720]  tract against... Well, look at how Bill and Melinda Gates and the Rockefeller Foundation
[01:41:37.920 --> 01:41:41.760]  are behind Zika. That's admitted, patented it. They're in the treatment of it. They're obsessed
[01:41:41.760 --> 01:41:46.000]  with gut flora. They're heavily involved with Monsanto. Of course, they're going to roll out
[01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:51.840]  of GMO products that then grow weed killer in our guts, that then grows cancers because they see us
[01:41:51.840 --> 01:41:59.360]  as weeds. By the way, Alex, we recommend that you keep the probiotics refrigerated, but the majority
[01:41:59.360 --> 01:42:04.640]  of probiotics in this formula are actually the way that we coat them with the certified organic
[01:42:05.280 --> 01:42:12.080]  gum acacia and the inulin in there. We actually give you food for the probiotics as well. So
[01:42:12.080 --> 01:42:16.960]  there's actually fulvic acid, which contains all the necessary minerals and nutrients the
[01:42:16.960 --> 01:42:22.480]  probiotics need to survive. We put the inulin in there, which is a natural food for probiotics,
[01:42:22.480 --> 01:42:29.440]  the gum acacia. So it's a probiotic, prebiotic formula as well. In fact, let's stop. You take
[01:42:29.440 --> 01:42:32.800]  five minutes and we'll get into designer babies because I've been interrupting with my excitement.
[01:42:32.800 --> 01:42:37.360]  Explain to people the seven years of research, taking from research in Europe, adding to it,
[01:42:37.360 --> 01:42:42.560]  testing years of you producing, making it better and better, why this is so different, why it's
[01:42:42.560 --> 01:42:46.960]  going to change the entire industry. And by the way, folks, five years ago, nobody was talking
[01:42:46.960 --> 01:42:51.200]  about true nascent iodine, not the alcohol-based garbage, not the stuff that you can absorb that's
[01:42:51.200 --> 01:42:57.520]  toxic, but true pure good halogen. Now you go to Whole Foods, it's everywhere, but it's still
[01:42:58.160 --> 01:43:02.880]  the garbage type. I mean, that's how lazy these companies are, or I guess they're not as blessed
[01:43:02.880 --> 01:43:08.720]  as we are, but we've changed the whole industry. When we say this will change probiotics, this will
[01:43:08.720 --> 01:43:14.000]  change it. You will in a few years. Everyone will be copying this because this is the best
[01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:19.120]  probiotic out there, bar nine. You go to medical clinics and get it for $400, maybe get something
[01:43:19.120 --> 01:43:24.480]  as good in Europe. So Dr. Group, break it down. Why it's such a game changer, biome defense.
[01:43:24.480 --> 01:43:30.160]  It's such a game changer because 70% of your immune system is actually in your digestive
[01:43:30.160 --> 01:43:35.600]  tract. It's now been proven that 90% of all autoimmune diseases, which are running rampant,
[01:43:35.600 --> 01:43:42.560]  are gut related. Nine out of 10 people with autism have probiotic imbalances. All the digestive
[01:43:42.560 --> 01:43:47.520]  disorders, leaky gut, constipation, Crohn's, it doesn't matter what it is, are all linked to
[01:43:47.520 --> 01:43:54.640]  probiotics. 70 million people suffer from digestive disorders. Dr. Alan Walker at Harvard actually,
[01:43:54.640 --> 01:44:00.800]  that's where I am right now. He's a world renowned doctor and probiotic specialist. He actually
[01:44:00.800 --> 01:44:07.680]  quotes, said probiotics turn on the immune system and prevent pathogens from taking hold.
[01:44:07.680 --> 01:44:12.400]  So we have the immune link. We also have a lot of neuroscience research coming out, which we've
[01:44:12.400 --> 01:44:19.840]  been saying for years. Your brain is in your gut. I mean, all the prescriptions that people are given,
[01:44:19.840 --> 01:44:26.400]  especially the antidepressants, the anti anxieties, all those affect your normal gut.
[01:44:26.400 --> 01:44:31.360]  Think about this. Think about if you have all the natural probiotics you need in your gut,
[01:44:31.360 --> 01:44:38.640]  how many antibiotics and prescription medications that people can get off of and come back to their
[01:44:38.640 --> 01:44:44.560]  normal state of living and they're doing it with just putting the proper types of microorganisms.
[01:44:44.560 --> 01:44:48.400]  I was about to tell the average medical doctor after you take antibiotics won't tell you it kills
[01:44:48.400 --> 01:44:53.360]  all your gut flora. You've got to take probiotic. They don't even tell people. Listen, I mean,
[01:44:53.360 --> 01:45:00.880]  well, a scary thought is they just did a study not too long ago and they found 34% of organic food
[01:45:00.880 --> 01:45:07.680]  contains traces of antibiotics. We have antibiotic residue in the water supply. We have antibiotic
[01:45:07.680 --> 01:45:14.720]  residue everywhere. So regardless, there's no if ands and buts about it. We have to focus on our
[01:45:14.720 --> 01:45:21.600]  own internal army. We have to take probiotics on a daily basis. I mean, and that's why I spent seven
[01:45:21.600 --> 01:45:26.480]  years trying to figure out which ones are the best, how to do it, which ones are going to work
[01:45:27.120 --> 01:45:32.240]  in unison. And most of them in the formula, we haven't had time to do the long-term studies to
[01:45:32.240 --> 01:45:38.960]  see if we really are losing a lot of activity by not keeping it refrigerated. But I can say 90%
[01:45:38.960 --> 01:45:43.360]  of the ones in there, we already know are heat resistant, acid resistant.
[01:45:43.360 --> 01:45:47.600]  But we still keep it cold, which is an added expense. But again, it's important.
[01:45:47.600 --> 01:45:52.800]  Now, I was interrupting you run through how this is a different proprietary process, but you did
[01:45:52.800 --> 01:45:58.480]  take known proven super high quality strains. You just boosted it giving them the enzymes,
[01:45:58.480 --> 01:46:01.600]  the food they need to launch and actually survive the stomach.
[01:46:03.040 --> 01:46:08.800]  We gave them everything that they're going to need to be able to survive and thrive. I mean,
[01:46:08.800 --> 01:46:16.640]  health begins in the gut and disease also begins in the gut. And so you're obviously
[01:46:16.640 --> 01:46:22.640]  going to be attacked every single day. I mean, the gut is the first line of defense that we have in
[01:46:22.640 --> 01:46:28.480]  our body. And especially with all the biological weapons, with all the chemical agents, everything
[01:46:28.480 --> 01:46:32.960]  else that's attacking us every single day, we need to make sure that we keep our gut healthy.
[01:46:32.960 --> 01:46:39.760]  That's why I chose the specific 23, 23 different strains of probiotics and biome defense.
[01:46:40.640 --> 01:46:45.680]  We have a special form of lactobacillus acidophilus, which produces vitamin K.
[01:46:45.680 --> 01:46:50.320]  Why do you think so many people are deficient in vitamin K in the world? Why do you think so many
[01:46:50.320 --> 01:46:56.800]  people are deficient in magnesium, calcium, copper, selenium, all of those things, the probiotics in
[01:46:56.800 --> 01:47:04.000]  your gut have a vital role in the absorption of some of the most sought after and needed minerals
[01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:10.720]  and vitamins in your body? We put the lactobacillus brevis in there. Why do we do that? Because we
[01:47:10.720 --> 01:47:16.960]  know that people are short on interferon. Interferon is a protein which is produced in response to
[01:47:16.960 --> 01:47:24.240]  viruses, bad bacteria, tumors, harmful organisms. So that's going to help your body naturally produce
[01:47:24.240 --> 01:47:28.400]  the interferon in there. And by the way, I remember you saying this six, seven, eight years ago that
[01:47:28.400 --> 01:47:35.600]  asthma's epidemic, much of it is because we don't have the right gut flora. And I was like,
[01:47:35.600 --> 01:47:39.040]  where's he coming from with that? Now they have a big study out the Wall Street Journal reporting on
[01:47:39.040 --> 01:47:46.240]  just that. Yeah, asthma, allergies, leaky gut syndrome, all of these molecules, probiotics,
[01:47:46.240 --> 01:47:51.120]  we didn't even talk about their role in digestion. Probiotics have an extremely powerful role in
[01:47:51.120 --> 01:47:57.280]  digestion. They help you digest your food. Not only is it the digestive enzymes, but also it's
[01:47:57.280 --> 01:48:02.800]  the probiotics. We put another probiotic in there that's missing. We found in the majority of the
[01:48:02.800 --> 01:48:09.360]  population, that's called lactobacillus gazerii. And that's used to keep your weight regulated.
[01:48:09.360 --> 01:48:15.600]  What we found is the majority of people don't have that. And when you do put that strain
[01:48:15.600 --> 01:48:21.120]  of probiotic, it initiates and these are all proven with clinical trials. And they've got big
[01:48:21.120 --> 01:48:25.360]  clinical trials. As you said, low gut flora, specifically that strain, you just keep eating
[01:48:25.360 --> 01:48:31.440]  and eating and gaining weight. Just like we knew 20 years ago, aspartame makes you want to eat more
[01:48:31.440 --> 01:48:34.800]  and makes you fatter. That's why you see the biggest, fattest people are obsessed with diet
[01:48:34.800 --> 01:48:40.320]  drinks. And finally, mainstream media two years ago admitted diet drinks headline make you fat,
[01:48:40.320 --> 01:48:46.400]  but specifically aspartame because it's a plan. They know what they're doing. And if you read
[01:48:46.400 --> 01:48:50.960]  deeply, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation are the ones quarterbacking this operation, Dr. Group.
[01:48:51.520 --> 01:48:56.480]  Yeah, talking about sugar, sugar is one of the most damaging things to the gut floor,
[01:48:56.480 --> 01:49:01.360]  especially the white processed sugar. But this one strain that we have this gazerii is actually
[01:49:01.360 --> 01:49:07.360]  used and been studied to promote weight loss. It helps reduce body fat and inhibits fat production.
[01:49:07.360 --> 01:49:13.760]  It speeds up the metabolism. It protects against obesity. Bottom line cows have three stomachs.
[01:49:13.760 --> 01:49:17.920]  They would die without the bacteria that break the grass down. We have a bacteria, another
[01:49:17.920 --> 01:49:25.040]  flora. We must have them. Incredible. Now, how does this work with taking the parasite cleanse
[01:49:25.600 --> 01:49:29.680]  that you developed for us, the living defense, because that's the big sleeper product that
[01:49:29.680 --> 01:49:36.160]  people just say they get the most amazing results with? Well, it works great with anything, actually.
[01:49:36.160 --> 01:49:44.240]  You can, I tell you, most of these probiotics that we chose have actually been used in combination
[01:49:44.240 --> 01:49:49.840]  with antibiotics. And the studies show that, you know, we think, yes, antibiotics will wipe out all
[01:49:49.840 --> 01:49:55.520]  the good bacteria. Every single doctor out there should be putting their patients on a probiotic
[01:49:55.520 --> 01:50:01.680]  at the same time as they're on antibiotics. But the bacteria associated with the production of
[01:50:01.680 --> 01:50:07.680]  farming and ranching and pig farming and chicken farming and poultry farming, those are all resistant
[01:50:07.680 --> 01:50:12.000]  because they feed them that stuff because it makes them bloat and get fat. People ask, why do these
[01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:16.880]  big chicken production facilities, and by the way, I've worked at it, folks, just on the edge of it,
[01:50:16.880 --> 01:50:20.960]  but I've been involved cleaning them out a job I had. It's hellish. You have to wear a breather
[01:50:20.960 --> 01:50:26.240]  mask and everything. It's because it makes them fat and obese. It makes the chickens and the pigs
[01:50:26.240 --> 01:50:30.640]  fat and obese. That's why they put it in their feed, but then it makes the bacteria that are in
[01:50:30.640 --> 01:50:35.040]  them totally resistant. Now you wonder why there's all the flesh-eating bacteria, but then you eat
[01:50:35.040 --> 01:50:40.160]  those animals, you get big dosages of it, so all you've got is the bad antibiotic resistant that
[01:50:40.160 --> 01:50:44.240]  are in the gut, which Bill Omeline and the Gates of Others are on record designing in many cases,
[01:50:44.800 --> 01:50:50.320]  specifically in the food chain to hit you with a soft-kill weapon developed at Cold Springs Harbor

[01:54:20.880 --> 01:54:24.800]  They consistently do bad things. Aspartame, we were just talking about that eats your brain,
[01:54:24.800 --> 01:54:36.000]  makes you obese, on record. Monsanto has a close second in Bayer, the Nazi pharmaceutical company,
[01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:39.840]  the company that knowingly shipped out factor 8 to hundreds of thousands of hemophiliacs
[01:54:39.840 --> 01:54:46.480]  in the 90s, and it came out in federal court in Australia and France that the CEOs were told,
[01:54:46.480 --> 01:54:52.160]  sir, you understand this is going to kill people. Everyone we give this to, it has hepatitis and
[01:54:52.160 --> 01:54:59.120]  HIV, and they're like, I don't care, too many hemophiliacs anyways. Man, you talk about evil,
[01:54:59.120 --> 01:55:03.120]  that's who they put in charge of these things, and that's what they say in corporate board meetings.
[01:55:04.160 --> 01:55:08.000]  Imagine sitting around in corporate board meetings, sir, we ship this out, hundreds of
[01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:15.520]  thousands will die. Yeah, well, the world needs ditch diggers too. You know, I've sent boys younger
[01:55:15.520 --> 01:55:20.240]  than you to the gas chamber, didn't want to do it, felt I owed it to them. I mean, where do these
[01:55:20.240 --> 01:55:26.880]  people come from? That's what I'm telling you. Guys, I've watched the PBS things that nobody else
[01:55:27.600 --> 01:55:31.600]  takes the time to go watch, where Bill Gates sits there and talks about his dad
[01:55:31.600 --> 01:55:37.120]  heading Planned Parenthood, and his dad, well, we went and researched him. Super spooky eugenics guy
[01:55:37.120 --> 01:55:43.280]  involved in the whole clandestine program, secret testing. That's why IBM, it's a eugenics front
[01:55:43.280 --> 01:55:49.200]  company that created Microsoft. That's all super secret, by the way, folks, is running the show.
[01:55:50.080 --> 01:55:55.520]  And they ran the hauler's machines, they ran the death camps, they ran the death camps. IBM
[01:55:55.520 --> 01:56:03.280]  technicians from the US were in each death camp. The numbers on the folks in the death camps were
[01:56:03.280 --> 01:56:09.200]  IBM hauler's numbers, okay? I mean, you don't get more evil than international business machines,
[01:56:09.200 --> 01:56:16.240]  okay? It's a eugenics company. Thomas Watson received the highest award that anyone in the Nazi
[01:56:16.240 --> 01:56:22.480]  regime awarded, above Adolf Hitler, who got the second highest award. The number one award
[01:56:22.480 --> 01:56:28.960]  that Nazis ever gave went to the creator of IBM. Now, that's all you got to know right there.
[01:56:29.600 --> 01:56:32.800]  That's why I get chills. That's why I'm cutting over group, because while he's talking, if you're a
[01:56:32.800 --> 01:56:37.600]  TV viewer, they're just in there Googling what he says, everything he says, even mainstream news.
[01:56:37.600 --> 01:56:42.960]  That's what's crazy. It's all admitted, folks, but all admitted in the last year or two. So,
[01:56:42.960 --> 01:56:47.360]  Dr. Group, I want to get into CRISPR in the next segment, then I know you got to go, but
[01:56:48.640 --> 01:56:52.960]  which is even bigger. But why do you think it's suddenly all coming out? I mean, isn't that kind
[01:56:52.960 --> 01:56:57.840]  of positive WikiLeaks and all this info? I mean, isn't it that people, even in the establishment,
[01:56:57.840 --> 01:57:01.920]  love their kids, there's only a few evil people on top trying to keep us in the dark? I mean,
[01:57:01.920 --> 01:57:05.440]  that's why what you're doing, what others are doing, what we're doing, you know, funding ourselves
[01:57:05.440 --> 01:57:10.480]  to put out the truth and give people things to counter this. I mean, it's just, it's a perfect
[01:57:10.480 --> 01:57:14.960]  symbiotic thing, but do you think we're starting to turn the tide or what do you think's happening?
[01:57:16.720 --> 01:57:22.000]  When you start seeing the pharmaceutical companies and the big companies starting getting into the
[01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:27.520]  probiotics and trying to acquire all the natural health companies, VMAs, that how many
[01:57:28.080 --> 01:57:33.360]  natural health companies you see on the shelves at Whole Foods that are actually owned by big
[01:57:33.360 --> 01:57:40.000]  conglomerates or private equity firms. They've been knocking on our door. It's crazy what's
[01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:43.680]  going on. They've tried to buy us. We've had, you know, which I had to send an honest closure
[01:57:43.680 --> 01:57:49.680]  obviously, but we've had some of the biggest cosmetic companies try to buy us. But at the same
[01:57:49.680 --> 01:57:54.160]  time, they're ramping up all their artificial intelligence. They're ramping up the vaccines.
[01:57:54.160 --> 01:57:58.400]  They're ramping up all the chemicals, you know, look at Bayard, Monsanto, like what you're talking
[01:57:58.400 --> 01:58:05.040]  about. You know, you really have, I always say we the people because, you know, the people can
[01:58:05.040 --> 01:58:11.440]  create change in the world faster than the politicians can. Look at all the, the good thing
[01:58:11.440 --> 01:58:16.880]  with the internet, the good thing with your radio show, all the things that we've been able to get
[01:58:16.880 --> 01:58:20.960]  out there to people so that they can help make. And that's why they're so scared. They know if we
[01:58:20.960 --> 01:58:25.120]  wake up and just change our behavior, it's a game over. That's why they want to get us into a fully
[01:58:25.120 --> 01:58:30.880]  artificial economy. They control because then there's hardly any way to get out. Stay there.
[01:58:30.880 --> 01:58:34.400]  We're going to come right back at 70 seconds to give you the floor on this. And then, but you've
[01:58:34.400 --> 01:58:38.560]  got to come to town. This is an on fire subject, Dr. Group. I know you're at Harvard right now,
[01:58:38.560 --> 01:58:41.680]  the top researchers. I mean, how cool is that? He wouldn't even, I'm like, where are you? I'm
[01:58:41.680 --> 01:58:46.240]  going to Harvard to meet with them on the probiotic. I mean, this guy knows what he's doing. I mean,
[01:58:46.240 --> 01:58:49.040]  we're not playing games here. And I'm so blessed to have him working with us.
[01:58:49.040 --> 01:58:55.120]  Please listen carefully, because I'm about to point out three things that will save you a lot
[01:58:55.120 --> 01:59:00.560]  of money while you get high quality products and fund the info war a 360 win. Number one,

[01:59:11.200 --> 01:59:16.560]  because we hold back a surplus for auto ship customers. Number three, we're giving you free
[01:59:16.560 --> 01:59:22.400]  shipping on all orders above $50. Listers have been requesting this for years, because it's so
[01:59:22.400 --> 01:59:27.120]  easy to forget to reorder the products that you need each month. Just go to info or store.com,

[01:59:48.800 --> 01:59:54.960]  sign up for auto ship. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:59:54.960 --> 02:00:18.160]  Waging war on corruption. It's Alex Jones coming to you right from the front lines of the info war.
[02:00:18.160 --> 02:00:35.760]  Ladies and gentlemen, you know, I stood up here and I cover this stuff and
[02:00:36.880 --> 02:00:39.680]  a lot of times we'll be far off from something and I make a prediction
[02:00:40.800 --> 02:00:44.480]  because of all the different data points I've got. And it's usually pretty darn on target.
[02:00:44.480 --> 02:00:50.640]  But let me tell you, it's not a good feeling to now have them openly announcing world government,
[02:00:50.640 --> 02:00:55.760]  openly announcing the UN is going to run race relations in the US and our local police departments.
[02:00:55.760 --> 02:01:02.320]  That's in the Washington Post. But at the same time, I guess it's goodness because
[02:01:03.040 --> 02:01:07.120]  our credibility is going to go up. It is going up. People are really listening now. Hillary's having
[02:01:07.120 --> 02:01:11.120]  to counter us. But then we know what the next shoot a drop is. They're going to shut us down.
[02:01:11.120 --> 02:01:14.960]  And they should shut down Michael Savage. He told me the week before they were trying to censor him
[02:01:14.960 --> 02:01:20.640]  at CBS. We're two days into him being off the air and people are not even making a big deal out of
[02:01:20.640 --> 02:01:25.920]  it. Because again, we're Americans. This can't happen here. I think we have to admit it did
[02:01:25.920 --> 02:01:31.520]  happen here, Dr. Group. You know, you were talking earlier, you know, are we making progress? Are
[02:01:31.520 --> 02:01:37.920]  we getting the information out? And I say yes. And I really think that we are at a tipping point
[02:01:37.920 --> 02:01:44.160]  and they are starting to realize that and they know that there's so many people going online.
[02:01:44.160 --> 02:01:50.160]  There's so many people out there that are outspoken now. Their lies are being, you know,
[02:01:50.160 --> 02:01:56.000]  discovered. They're being open. Everybody's starting to realize it. So the next step, I mean,
[02:01:56.000 --> 02:02:00.400]  obviously get the UN involved. You can blame it on the UN. That way it doesn't have anything to do
[02:02:00.400 --> 02:02:06.800]  with the US government. And it really is kind of scary thinking about what's going to happen here
[02:02:06.800 --> 02:02:11.440]  in the next couple of years, what direction we're going to go. Think about it. I mean, what happens
[02:02:11.440 --> 02:02:16.880]  if they shut the internet down? I mean, that's going to completely restrict access to people
[02:02:16.880 --> 02:02:21.760]  getting everything they need to protect themselves. It's going. And who takes the UN over in three
[02:02:21.760 --> 02:02:27.360]  days? I mean, who takes the internet over in three days? Yeah. Yeah. I mean, another thing that's
[02:02:28.960 --> 02:02:34.480]  looking around and one of the hot topics right now that we're getting at our office is just like,
[02:02:34.480 --> 02:02:40.240]  how many people do you know that are happy? I mean, you have the so much controversy going on
[02:02:40.240 --> 02:02:45.360]  with the elections. You have people that are just under so much stress these days. And by the way,
[02:02:45.360 --> 02:02:49.600]  stress is another big fact. I know liberals, fake liberals that have always been friendly to me,
[02:02:49.600 --> 02:02:53.760]  that now are mad at me and won't talk to me when I see them. And I'm like, hey, I forgive you for
[02:02:53.760 --> 02:03:00.000]  being a gun grabbing idiot. Why do you have to hate me now? And they're so unhappy. It's like
[02:03:00.000 --> 02:03:06.080]  spreading in a way. And I think that, you know, back to the gut issue, how important it is because
[02:03:06.080 --> 02:03:11.520]  90% of the serotonin is produced in your gut. And they admit anxiety, depression, it's all record
[02:03:11.520 --> 02:03:16.880]  high. You have more nerves. Think about the brain. Think about how many nerve pathways you have in
[02:03:16.880 --> 02:03:21.360]  the brain. You have more in your stomach and digestive tract than you do in your brain. Your
[02:03:21.360 --> 02:03:26.160]  appendix, which I've said for a long time, is one of the most important things. It's really your
[02:03:26.160 --> 02:03:31.760]  micro computer system of your whole body. Your appendix is your brain. It actually squirts out
[02:03:31.760 --> 02:03:38.160]  probiotics when you need it. It's the Russians and the Germans link the appendix to controlling
[02:03:38.160 --> 02:03:42.960]  every system in your body, the endocrine, the neurological system. And what do we do? We cut
[02:03:42.960 --> 02:03:49.520]  it out. But one of the good things about people really repairing and getting that gut that's
[02:03:49.520 --> 02:03:54.400]  those three pounds is what you're supposed to have of good bacteria, which by the way,
[02:03:54.400 --> 02:04:00.240]  weighs as much as your brain. Your brain weighs three pounds. So go figure on that one. But when
[02:04:00.240 --> 02:04:05.360]  you do have a bacteria or part of a high tech electrochemical sensor system interfacing with
[02:04:05.360 --> 02:04:09.200]  our brain, the gut is hooked into the spinal cord and it's just the bottom of the brain.
[02:04:10.000 --> 02:04:14.240]  Yeah. The gastrointestinal tract actually has a nerve running straight to the brain. It's called
[02:04:14.240 --> 02:04:18.480]  the Vegas. Exactly. It's perfect sense. The brain runs the whole show and it's down there. You know,
[02:04:18.480 --> 02:04:23.840]  it's enjoying the food itself. I mean, it's just the brain. The gut is the brain. The gut is
[02:04:23.840 --> 02:04:30.640]  actually the brain and the gut actually controls everything. And that's the biggest secret that
[02:04:30.640 --> 02:04:36.320]  the medical profession hopes you never find out. Well, folks, go with the gut. We've got the new
[02:04:36.320 --> 02:04:42.160]  probiotics, seven years of the making, biome defense, game changer. I cannot hype how awesome it is.

[02:05:03.840 --> 02:05:09.680]  really feels about Sharia law, look no further than her father, a video surfaced of Said Abedin
[02:05:09.680 --> 02:05:14.640]  outlining his view of Sharia law and how the Western world has turned Muslims hostile. The video was
[02:05:14.640 --> 02:05:20.960]  recorded in 1971 and titled the world of Islam. Said Abedin indicates that any culture change
[02:05:20.960 --> 02:05:26.000]  will have to be validated by the tenants of Islam. The video provides a window into the Abedin's
[02:05:26.000 --> 02:05:30.080]  family ideology, which has been examined for its connection with the Muslim Brotherhood.
[02:05:30.080 --> 02:05:35.360]  The Abedin family are responsible for creating the Journal of Muslim Minority Affairs, of which
[02:05:35.360 --> 02:05:40.800]  Huma Abedin lists herself as the assistant editor of for 12 years. The publication is accused of
[02:05:40.800 --> 02:05:46.480]  having ties to the Muslim Brotherhood and for promoting a hard line Islamic ideological stance.
[02:05:46.480 --> 02:05:51.920]  She's also had a hand in the work of the Institute of Muslim Minority Affairs, a think tank established
[02:05:51.920 --> 02:05:57.120]  in Saudi Arabia. It's been accused that a financier of Al Qaeda funded it. I'm Margaret

[02:10:02.320 --> 02:10:10.000]  of the uh head young turd. I agree with you jank so f***ing much that's absolutely right when you
[02:10:10.000 --> 02:10:14.960]  use the f word you know it's real talk okay so we have a bunch of people who wanted to make phone

[02:10:22.800 --> 02:10:27.840]  Paul Joseph Watson here first time caller i'd really like to get your clarification on the
[02:10:27.840 --> 02:10:33.840]  armenian genocide specifically if you accept the historical fact that it happened okay all right
[02:10:33.840 --> 02:10:40.720]  i understand because that's bullsh** get the f*** off the phone that's racist you're racist get the f***

[02:10:53.360 --> 02:11:02.400]  discussion f*** you. Hi hi jank i i'm not sure if you remember me i was on your show a while back
[02:11:03.200 --> 02:11:09.120]  and uh and you you asked me uh demanded that i make you a ham sandwich and i was just kind of
[02:11:09.120 --> 02:11:12.640]  wondering if you still wanted that sandwich i could probably put it in the mail for you.
[02:11:12.640 --> 02:11:21.200]  Yeah okay Karen everybody knows as if it is a joke okay and you didn't f***ing make me have
[02:11:21.200 --> 02:11:25.440]  a sandwich that's bullsh** it that's bullsh** it let's stop right there now that's that's him
[02:11:25.440 --> 02:11:29.120]  doing his imitation of jank which if you've actually watched him and how he blew up at me
[02:11:29.840 --> 02:11:32.800]  i thought it was all a joke before because they're one of the few shows that said we're
[02:11:32.800 --> 02:11:36.400]  going to yell at you a little bit are you okay with that it's not staged but i said
[02:11:36.400 --> 02:11:40.640]  sure i'll yell back at you you know that's fine i've probably been on the show more than 10 times
[02:11:40.640 --> 02:11:46.560]  and they brought me up there acted like it was a setup acted like roger stone tried to take over
[02:11:46.560 --> 02:11:51.920]  roger's like 15 feet away in a hallway internet thought that we were like in their studio in la
[02:11:51.920 --> 02:11:57.680]  and had invaded no it was like radio row everyone 10 feet apart crammed in to a parking garage that
[02:11:57.680 --> 02:12:03.120]  they put air conditioners in so i don't know this guy's crazy or what but the point is i don't want
[02:12:03.120 --> 02:12:07.200]  to make this whole interview about that i want to get um steven crowders take on the election uh on
[02:12:07.200 --> 02:12:12.800]  the debate uh on you know where this crazy world's going but i gotta tell you the young turks uh are
[02:12:12.800 --> 02:12:18.000]  really pieces of work so great job uh imitating him well thank you i it's always painful for me to
[02:12:18.000 --> 02:12:22.560]  go back and watch myself but when i see that i don't even see myself i see chank in there you know
[02:12:22.560 --> 02:12:27.600]  it was it was uh it was really bizarre that whole altercation with with you and them and i found it
[02:12:27.600 --> 02:12:33.600]  funny that someone who was misbody positivity strong feminist went from zero to fat shaming in
[02:12:33.600 --> 02:12:38.240]  about like two seconds when she got mad with you right away that was all that was all she did
[02:12:38.240 --> 02:12:42.000]  she just called you fat and swore it you had told you to get off and then she's going to do a whole
[02:12:42.000 --> 02:12:47.840]  uh young turks piece about why we need to respect an ogle amy schumer's thighs that i think that's
[02:12:47.840 --> 02:12:53.280]  the big issue use the term classically liberal people my age just they're tired of of being
[02:12:53.280 --> 02:12:58.160]  told how to think i guess people who are younger and i i don't use a term classically liberal
[02:12:58.160 --> 02:13:03.760]  namely because there's no tag for for leftist on youtube so people get mad with the wordplay
[02:13:03.760 --> 02:13:09.360]  but uh yeah i think the young turks recently have been exposed if you look at when i started on youtube
[02:13:09.360 --> 02:13:13.520]  years and years ago and you did i think you guys heard a little bit after and i obviously grew
[02:13:13.520 --> 02:13:17.840]  much more quickly because well you guys are you but the young turks were huge they were wildly
[02:13:17.840 --> 02:13:23.440]  popular they've attacked all of us very personally uh and they were all backed by google always backed
[02:13:23.440 --> 02:13:28.400]  by google always pushed by the system oh yeah we've had copyright claims just this week when
[02:13:28.400 --> 02:13:32.800]  we use newsworthy clips from the debates or or whatever or an interview maybe was before the
[02:13:32.800 --> 02:13:37.120]  debates and uh they said well it wasn't fair use i go if it's not fair use the young turks don't have
[02:13:37.120 --> 02:13:42.160]  a show all they do is turn on fox news for three minutes and then bitch for about five and a half
[02:13:42.160 --> 02:13:46.720]  minutes that's their entire show but of course their stuff doesn't get taken down so i think
[02:13:46.720 --> 02:13:51.280]  people are aware now with facebook with youtube with twitter though i think youtube is better than
[02:13:51.280 --> 02:13:55.760]  most of those those other entities because there is a system for recourse people are seeing for
[02:13:55.760 --> 02:14:00.880]  the first time this push that is coming from the progressive left sure and that's why various
[02:14:00.880 --> 02:14:05.200]  dudes even crowded yeah that's where i was going the reason i first played this clip and i was about
[02:14:05.200 --> 02:14:10.960]  to say why i played it is because the censorship michael sabbage taken off two days ago for talking
[02:14:10.960 --> 02:14:16.240]  about hillary's health i talked to him that's what happened okay this is really going on uh the un
[02:14:16.240 --> 02:14:20.880]  coming in saying we want reparations for black americans when the un is literally displacing
[02:14:20.880 --> 02:14:25.680]  african tribes and killing them on record from rwanda to you name it right now i mean talk about
[02:14:25.680 --> 02:14:31.040]  the pot call the kettle evil we have all this unfolding we have total censorship in europe
[02:14:31.040 --> 02:14:37.120]  classical tyranny calls to censor the internet the un gets control the web in three days i mean
[02:14:37.120 --> 02:14:41.440]  these people are true authoritarians it seems yeah absolutely and i know you use the term
[02:14:41.440 --> 02:14:45.040]  globalist a lot and then a lot of people take it and they don't really know what they're talking
[02:14:45.040 --> 02:14:49.520]  about and when you set up everything as a globalist agenda well then when there's really a globalist
[02:14:49.520 --> 02:14:54.480]  problem it sort of falls on deaf ears the un situation when barack obama i'm sure you covered
[02:14:54.480 --> 02:14:59.120]  this went before them and said last week yeah the us is going to have to do with some some less
[02:14:59.120 --> 02:15:04.400]  freedoms for basically the greater good of the that is actual it's not a conspiracy that is actual
[02:15:04.400 --> 02:15:10.640]  the un some form of a global governing entity and barack obama saying that he is willing to give up
[02:15:10.640 --> 02:15:15.280]  american sovereignty and the rights of americans who didn't sign off on this to appease the un who
[02:15:15.280 --> 02:15:20.720]  might as well be called the i hate america and israel club let's be honest that is an issue
[02:15:20.720 --> 02:15:26.720]  i am dumbfounded that more media entities didn't pick up and the same thing with the internet
[02:15:26.720 --> 02:15:30.880]  i mean listen if you really want a true and free internet unless you believe that you're going to
[02:15:30.880 --> 02:15:36.080]  be favored somehow you should be absolutely mortified at this idea of the internet being
[02:15:36.080 --> 02:15:41.120]  by the way we have the george soros emails thanks to wiki leagues just from five weeks ago that say
[02:15:41.120 --> 02:15:46.560]  hey we're going to use this un takeover to favor our operations and shut down our competition but
[02:15:46.560 --> 02:15:51.680]  forget that we have hillary's email a month ago three weeks ago saying the alt right has no right
[02:15:51.680 --> 02:15:56.000]  to exist so so steven let me bring the substance you kind of halfway not really jab that brought
[02:15:56.000 --> 02:16:00.800]  something up i would watch world leaders at davos online six seven years ago called for world
[02:16:00.800 --> 02:16:05.120]  government i would come out and say it people would say i was making it up so i never said
[02:16:05.120 --> 02:16:08.640]  globalism was everything and i know you're talking about other people like you no no but other people
[02:16:08.640 --> 02:16:12.800]  do make stuff up i agree with you but the point is it's so unbelievable i don't blame folks for
[02:16:12.800 --> 02:16:17.920]  denying it's happening because it sounds so crazy but now it really is happening so i have to tell
[02:16:17.920 --> 02:16:22.320]  you i felt like i was out on a limb 20 years ago talking about this now i don't so let me ask you
[02:16:22.320 --> 02:16:28.480]  this question what do you think starts to happen as the most radical concerns we had as libertarians
[02:16:28.480 --> 02:16:34.480]  or conservatives actually come true what does that portend gosh it's it's a good question especially
[02:16:34.480 --> 02:16:38.720]  in an era of of someone like donald trump where you know you see someone who could have some
[02:16:38.720 --> 02:16:43.280]  authoritarian tendencies on certain issues and certainly could be incredibly progressive in a
[02:16:43.280 --> 02:16:47.600]  good way on other issues i think government um here's my point i was saying you know for example
[02:16:47.600 --> 02:16:52.000]  when i say gosh i was watching the debates and i've tried to be fair to someone like donald trump
[02:16:52.000 --> 02:16:55.120]  when i think he's right support him when i think he's right and criticize him when i think it's
[02:16:55.120 --> 02:16:59.840]  fair i've been told that my career will be destroyed proactively by people you know in this
[02:16:59.840 --> 02:17:04.320]  uh they sort of conservative movement we can we we could talk about that off nationalist populist
[02:17:04.320 --> 02:17:08.000]  movement there are people that get really mad if you don't support trump a good example like when
[02:17:08.000 --> 02:17:13.040]  i say hey oh man he dropped the ball in the no fly list answer i totally agree and then they go well
[02:17:13.040 --> 02:17:18.000]  that's because you're a globalist no that's where it's misuse i can disagree with donald trump on
[02:17:18.000 --> 02:17:22.400]  an issue particularly domestic policy as it relates to the second amendment and people just toss out
[02:17:22.400 --> 02:17:27.360]  globalist to anyone they disagree with my point is when you do that it dilutes what you're talking
[02:17:27.360 --> 02:17:32.240]  about what i'm talking about barack obama standing in front of the un saying we are going to give up
[02:17:32.240 --> 02:17:38.640]  americans rights for the betterment not even of the world really the un agenda that is true
[02:17:38.640 --> 02:17:43.920]  world government globalism and that is terrifying to me you're absolutely right and now the
[02:17:43.920 --> 02:17:48.000]  administration admits that and and specifically what you hit is absolutely on target because we
[02:17:48.000 --> 02:17:52.560]  were talking before we went live you said listen i don't know if it's okay but i'm gonna go after
[02:17:52.560 --> 02:17:56.160]  trump a little bit here i mean i obviously is better than hillary but i'm gonna go after trump
[02:17:56.160 --> 02:18:00.720]  because you know there's no fly thing i said hey listen stop and frisk i don't agree with that either
[02:18:00.720 --> 02:18:04.880]  he has some of these authoritarian leanings but at least he's not a globalist which just means
[02:18:04.880 --> 02:18:09.600]  wants to sell us out to multinational interest wants to sign over our sovereignty wants to do
[02:18:09.600 --> 02:18:14.320]  one-sided trade deals i get those real problems and i think those of us that really do support
[02:18:14.320 --> 02:18:19.760]  trump have to though keep his feet to the fire and legitimately say where he's wrong i mean hillary
[02:18:19.760 --> 02:18:24.480]  is wrong rama manuals wrong who first came up with this saying we'll just put you on an extra
[02:18:24.480 --> 02:18:30.960]  judicial list and then not let you have guns well no that's totally anti-american and trump's wrong
[02:18:31.520 --> 02:18:35.280]  right well and what concerns me is the fact that he's gone back and forth and that which tells me
[02:18:35.280 --> 02:18:40.000]  he doesn't really understand that issue listen just because someone has put on an arbitrary list
[02:18:40.000 --> 02:18:44.160]  with no type of process that's disclosed no appeal process that's even available doesn't
[02:18:44.160 --> 02:18:47.920]  mean because you sort of say well we'll make it easier for them to get off no no you don't get
[02:18:47.920 --> 02:18:52.720]  to take away someone's basic fundamental human right because of some arbitrary is created by the
[02:18:52.720 --> 02:18:59.040]  government and the fact that he didn't for me that was the biggest headbanger moment from his side
[02:18:59.040 --> 02:19:04.640]  i agree debate i was really upset well the stop and frisk thing too i mean i get these are high
[02:19:04.640 --> 02:19:09.600]  crime areas i get it's people dressing gangbanger guard but still not due process and i get the
[02:19:09.600 --> 02:19:14.480]  chicago and places are falling apart well how do you handle a place that has more murders and
[02:19:14.480 --> 02:19:19.120]  basically half the country combined like chicago run by democrats and then people say hey start
[02:19:19.120 --> 02:19:23.600]  to stop and frisk it cleaned up new york i mean i agree it's unconstitutional it's very authoritarian
[02:19:23.600 --> 02:19:28.640]  i don't like it but do i want two thousand dead black people right well that's a good point you
[02:19:28.640 --> 02:19:32.240]  just that you just brought that up see you had a legitimate criticism with donald trump and stop
[02:19:32.240 --> 02:19:38.000]  and frisk and you explained it what's the left criticism it's racist right that's not the that's
[02:19:38.000 --> 02:19:42.320]  not it's not racist that's not the point the point isn't no you can say it's unconstitutional
[02:19:42.320 --> 02:19:46.000]  you don't have the right to do this so the problem is even when there are legitimate criticisms of
[02:19:46.000 --> 02:19:51.040]  donald trump or of course hillary clinton the left has diluted and then a lot of people who are ill
[02:19:51.040 --> 02:19:55.200]  informed on the right have diluted it to the point where it's like well you're not making legitimate
[02:19:55.200 --> 02:20:00.720]  criticism let me ask you this where is it going then uh you do you mean the election i mean just
[02:20:00.720 --> 02:20:04.480]  all of it because it seems like i was always more of a libertarian bashing republicans
[02:20:04.480 --> 02:20:10.160]  the democrats but the democrats really have like mutated into this just crazy town where that i mean
[02:20:10.160 --> 02:20:14.080]  i'll be out of the event and they'll have a gay pride parade and they'll run up and say you're a
[02:20:14.080 --> 02:20:18.800]  homophobe i've never bashed gay people that's not my issue i don't like them going in with their
[02:20:18.800 --> 02:20:23.200]  leftist agenda of gun control you know into the schools attached to it but i'm not against them
[02:20:23.200 --> 02:20:27.920]  and then and i say where have i bashed people's right to live their lives uh you're a racist
[02:20:27.920 --> 02:20:33.680]  you're a homophobe donald trump's a homophobe donald trump's never been that no no donald trump
[02:20:33.680 --> 02:20:38.160]  hasn't listen i think of the legitimate criticisms of donald trump the fact that he's a racist or
[02:20:38.160 --> 02:20:42.560]  homophobe is is not one of them and uh so i think you're seeing the left shoot themselves in the
[02:20:42.560 --> 02:20:47.120]  foot that's why they're going bring out zack gilfanakis in between two ferns do the joss weeden
[02:20:47.120 --> 02:20:50.720]  video with all the celebrities we can get together here's something to you i'm sure you've noticed
[02:20:50.720 --> 02:20:55.840]  and you'll enjoy remember it used to be the voter die campaign with p diddy and cameron deez and they
[02:20:55.840 --> 02:20:59.920]  came out and drew berymore they would say i don't care who you vote for i just want you to register
[02:20:59.920 --> 02:21:03.680]  and vote now they've come out and just said you have to vote hillary clinton so what's happened
[02:21:03.680 --> 02:21:08.560]  is this it's it's really shine the light on the bias the implicit yeah the pretense that that they
[02:21:08.560 --> 02:21:13.440]  weren't bias is all gone that's all gone and that's that's a wonderful thing i will say this politically
[02:21:14.240 --> 02:21:18.480]  i don't know this election that anyone who says they can predict it is you know listen they don't
[02:21:18.480 --> 02:21:23.120]  have a crystal ball and this is so unpredictable the clintons are the masters of the october surprise
[02:21:23.120 --> 02:21:28.720]  it could go either way so i don't try and in sort of dabble in that realm because i know that if
[02:21:28.720 --> 02:21:32.320]  if these people who are experts get it wrong half the time i don't have a shot i will say this
[02:21:32.320 --> 02:21:37.680]  politically it could be dark for a while could not be but it could be dark the winning issues i
[02:21:37.680 --> 02:21:41.840]  do think where we are seeing progress and sorry the words are hard to use i know you know where
[02:21:41.840 --> 02:21:45.200]  i'm coming from they're taking all the words over is we have crashed through political correctness
[02:21:45.200 --> 02:21:49.760]  trump has made it safe for people to break out of this this this little box is that what you're
[02:21:49.760 --> 02:21:53.840]  about to say well no i think there are four winning issues if i'm if i'm advising a republican
[02:21:53.840 --> 02:21:59.600]  candidate guns are a big winning issue uh calling islamic terrorism what it is people can do that
[02:21:59.600 --> 02:22:05.520]  now uh feminine taxes well i don't think with young people i think the gender roles this whole lgbtq
[02:22:05.520 --> 02:22:11.440]  aip there's a rejection of that and free speech those four issues are strong winning issues for
[02:22:11.440 --> 02:22:15.760]  the right for libertarians for conservatives um and i think they would do better to fill
[02:22:15.760 --> 02:22:19.280]  they hadn't met the trumps done bad with millennials but now they're slipping with hillary
[02:22:19.920 --> 02:22:25.520]  yeah well that's because that's just because it's hillary comes in hey guys i got hot sauce
[02:22:25.520 --> 02:22:30.320]  don't you like me blacks i'm into pandering is just so easy to see with hillary clinton
[02:22:30.320 --> 02:22:34.080]  with millennials she's like the uncomfortable and it's like a weird granny who's really a
[02:22:34.080 --> 02:22:38.880]  james bondville and since you mentioned this un clip it's a minute long here is the un clip of
[02:22:38.880 --> 02:22:43.360]  obama saying you know americans i gotta get on them sometimes they don't want to adhere to
[02:22:43.360 --> 02:22:48.480]  international standards standards and a bunch of offshore mega banks who literally are funding
[02:22:48.480 --> 02:22:52.480]  anti you know gun programs here that's who the globalist are these big corporations that just
[02:22:52.480 --> 02:22:57.680]  want to play god they want to have a corporate takeover of the free market and they want obama
[02:22:57.680 --> 02:23:03.680]  to sell us this idea to transfer our rights into these nebulous tpp agreements here it is but we
[02:23:03.680 --> 02:23:12.000]  have to put our money where our mouths are and we can only realize the promise of this
[02:23:12.000 --> 02:23:18.640]  institution's founding to replace the ravages of war with cooperation if powerful nations
[02:23:19.440 --> 02:23:27.040]  like my own accept constraints sometimes i'm criticized in my own country
[02:23:27.040 --> 02:23:35.440]  or professing a belief in international norms and multilateral institutions but i am convinced
[02:23:35.440 --> 02:23:43.200]  that in the long run giving up some freedom of action not giving up our ability to protect
[02:23:43.200 --> 02:23:50.480]  ourselves or pursue our core interests but binding ourselves to international rules over the
[02:23:50.480 --> 02:23:58.560]  long-term enhances our security now again steven crowded lot of the crowder dot com a tv radio
[02:23:58.560 --> 02:24:03.840]  host uh what what do you think we should do about these moves towards global government what should
[02:24:03.840 --> 02:24:08.400]  we do about the washington post with the un panel headed up by saudi arabia that's a joke human
[02:24:08.400 --> 02:24:14.400]  rights panel saying white people owe black people for a history of racial terrorism i mean what if
[02:24:14.400 --> 02:24:18.960]  you're russian in background and have no national history of even being connected to africans still
[02:24:18.960 --> 02:24:24.320]  you've got to pay reparations yeah it's it's i i'm just i'm still listening to that it's it's
[02:24:24.320 --> 02:24:29.360]  unbelievable if i were to write a script of an evil leader you know who's trying to subvert the
[02:24:29.360 --> 02:24:34.080]  american system to globalism and write what brock obama just said producers would say this is this
[02:24:34.080 --> 02:24:38.320]  is too obvious no one would ever say this and they would toss it away it is exactly that it is that
[02:24:38.320 --> 02:24:42.480]  bad at that point they're saying it openly um as far as what they should you know the reparations
[02:24:42.480 --> 02:24:48.560]  thing is is is so silly i was raised in canada too so there is um there's a race to victim culture
[02:24:48.560 --> 02:24:54.000]  right now i mean look at you have rachel dulzal and shan king competing to be black because
[02:24:54.000 --> 02:24:59.360]  they get a leg up if if if you were a victim an actual victim if it were a disadvantage in the
[02:24:59.360 --> 02:25:03.200]  united states you wouldn't have more and more people faking that they're black you wouldn't
[02:25:03.200 --> 02:25:08.640]  have people who are biracial people like barack obama raised to white parents uh who who decide
[02:25:08.640 --> 02:25:13.200]  to identify and claim entire blackness and then of course they say people like ben carson and
[02:25:13.200 --> 02:25:19.040]  herman kain aren't actually black so the reparation situation is is sure but also most whites immigrated
[02:25:19.040 --> 02:25:23.680]  to the u.s after slavery and most european countries have no connection in england ended
[02:25:23.680 --> 02:25:28.880]  international slave trade shawty arabia was the last country to supposedly get rid of it in 1968
[02:25:28.880 --> 02:25:34.160]  how in the hell is it always muslims lecturing me that i am involved in the slave trade i mean
[02:25:34.160 --> 02:25:40.240]  this is crazy well why aren't they asking uh the african slave traders to give reparations if they're
[02:25:40.240 --> 02:25:47.040]  going to go back to exactly the ultimate slavery so are we seeing a peak in social justice warriors
[02:25:47.040 --> 02:25:52.720]  or are we wrong is it about to get even worse well i hate these because that term peak oil remember
[02:25:52.720 --> 02:25:56.400]  that was the scare tactic with climate change peak oil and it never happened that for people
[02:25:56.400 --> 02:26:01.440]  listening right now i get criticized often because of they claim your climate denier which i'm not i
[02:26:01.440 --> 02:26:05.920]  just don't think they could a protocol or bernie's tax plan would fix climate change remember peak
[02:26:05.920 --> 02:26:10.880]  there's more oil now than ever there's more sure that was proven to be bold right peak oil so peak
[02:26:10.880 --> 02:26:15.600]  social justice warriors how crazy will they get i don't you know i don't know if they're in their
[02:26:15.600 --> 02:26:20.000]  death throes right now it does depend on what happens with the education system it does depend
[02:26:20.000 --> 02:26:23.680]  on what happens with you know if conservatives are able to continue getting a foothold you know
[02:26:23.680 --> 02:26:28.640]  obviously people like you uh people like paul joseph watson uh on youtube and unable to get
[02:26:28.640 --> 02:26:34.080]  that information out there if that happens i think we stand a chance culturally it's still
[02:26:34.080 --> 02:26:38.640]  hard to fight against people who want free gimmies financially that's why you know we look at our
[02:26:38.640 --> 02:26:42.720]  analytics you know this you have i'm sure robust analytics online we can see on youtube we can see
[02:26:42.720 --> 02:26:48.320]  on social media the website a lot of the trump people were bernie people uh so a lot of them were
[02:26:48.320 --> 02:26:52.720]  still you know that's sort of economic protectionism and sometimes he kind of gives these veiled
[02:26:52.720 --> 02:26:57.280]  promises to unions which i'm not super thrilled about but you see a lot of young people who
[02:26:57.280 --> 02:27:01.360]  liked the free stuff from bernie like though what are you going to do for me that sort of populism
[02:27:01.360 --> 02:27:06.880]  uh but they were sort of social justice leftists and and so obviously there's been a flipping of
[02:27:06.880 --> 02:27:12.080]  the priority uh right now with sort of this adherence to populism so i can't predict it but
[02:27:12.080 --> 02:27:16.960]  like i said i think those four winning issues are guns gender roles uh terrorist islam and
[02:27:16.960 --> 02:27:21.760]  free speech if we can focus on those those are winning arguments with the vast majority of
[02:27:21.760 --> 02:27:25.440]  millennials don't be fooled by the college students the trigly puffs who just scream the
[02:27:25.440 --> 02:27:31.040]  loudest i think they're a dying breed i hope i hope alex well but the way i don't hope because
[02:27:31.040 --> 02:27:36.320]  it's so entertaining i mean it is it is it's tough when you show up on this well i don't
[02:27:36.320 --> 02:27:40.480]  know if you ever saw that clip i showed up i was my love christina summers and i feel bad because
[02:27:40.480 --> 02:27:45.760]  it was great trigly puff but i came out and i've done stand up my entire life and she was
[02:27:45.760 --> 02:27:48.400]  giving me the finger i don't know if i can because i don't know if you have to blur it so i don't
[02:27:48.400 --> 02:27:51.760]  know it's incredible you did an amazing job well she she did it was like she didn't have
[02:27:51.760 --> 02:27:57.600]  enough fingers to give and i hadn't even said anything yet um that was and if it seemed like
[02:27:57.600 --> 02:28:03.680]  i was mean to her i hope people watching understand my job is not to convince the crazy so invested
[02:28:03.680 --> 02:28:09.280]  social justice left us you're wasting your time but you can convert the three four million people
[02:28:09.280 --> 02:28:15.040]  who saw that video and saw the hypocrisy sure it's like don't become this poor brainwashed person
[02:28:15.760 --> 02:28:19.680]  by the cult that is modern liberalism that is really authoritarianism is really mind control
[02:28:19.680 --> 02:28:23.920]  we'll be right back with a little bit more time with mr krauter but this is what he was mentioning
[02:28:23.920 --> 02:28:28.800]  earlier anna kasparian from the young turds flipping out on me for no reason we'll be right
[02:28:28.800 --> 02:28:33.680]  back stay with us on the other side a lot of the people that are picking on him for his weight
[02:28:33.680 --> 02:28:40.720]  gain aren't really lookers themselves and it's the it's the classic bullying move where you
[02:28:40.720 --> 02:28:46.320]  want to feel better about yourself so you look to someone um and and pick on their imperfections
[02:28:46.320 --> 02:28:53.840]  to feel good about yourself it's just it's stupid she strikes me as someone who's actually
[02:28:53.840 --> 02:29:02.960]  trying to make a very serious and very terrible statement about overweight people look i think
[02:29:02.960 --> 02:29:08.560]  that if someone if someone that cares about you tells you like hey let's get healthy together
[02:29:08.560 --> 02:29:12.640]  it's not fat shaming you know fat shaming is pointing a finger at you and being like you're
[02:29:12.640 --> 02:29:21.440]  fat i think that this study is really fascinating because i mean i can relate to it big time um
[02:29:21.440 --> 02:29:26.960]  because when i was uh about four years old my dance instructor told me that i was overweight
[02:29:27.520 --> 02:29:31.760]  and okay so here's the deal folks these people are the biggest hypocrites in the galaxy
[02:29:32.640 --> 02:29:36.800]  they are who they say they aren't study show liberals are six times more likely to steal
[02:29:36.800 --> 02:29:41.040]  and more than eight times were likely not to give donations these are pigs we'll be right back with
[02:29:41.040 --> 02:29:49.920]  steven crowded i'm alex jones with info wars dot com lot of the crowded dot com stay with us we're on
[02:29:49.920 --> 02:30:01.600]  the march the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network new information is coming
[02:30:01.600 --> 02:30:07.360]  forth about the terrorist omar matine who killed 49 people and wounded 53 others in the gay orland
[02:30:07.360 --> 02:30:12.480]  or nightclub attack a transcript of the conversation between matine and the police negotiator has been
[02:30:12.480 --> 02:30:17.040]  released and it sheds new light on matine's motivation for the murders matine was triggered by a
[02:30:17.040 --> 02:30:22.560]  pentagon drone strike a month before the attack he told the negotiator saying quote yo the airstrike
[02:30:22.560 --> 02:30:27.520]  that killed abu wahid a few weeks ago that's what triggered it okay they should not have bombed and
[02:30:27.520 --> 02:30:33.600]  killed abu wahid he also identifies himself as a follower of isis now initial reports from several
[02:30:33.600 --> 02:30:38.800]  news outlets reported matine had described himself as gay but he was a homophobe and a
[02:30:38.800 --> 02:30:43.360]  wife beater despite him making claims that he belonged to isis the new york times stated three
[02:30:43.360 --> 02:30:48.160]  days after the massacre that quote the precise motivation of matine remains unclear now the
[02:30:48.160 --> 02:30:52.960]  false narrative was perpetuated for a week the president himself attempting to paint omar matine
[02:30:52.960 --> 02:30:58.720]  as a lone wolf shooter anything responsible the radical islam i'm margaret hell reporting for info

[02:33:32.400 --> 02:33:37.840]  talk show hosts and i'm on less than 200 stations but close to it savage is on over 400 there aren't
[02:33:37.840 --> 02:33:42.080]  many other hosts that have other hosts on and savage has me on his show he has paul watson on
[02:33:42.720 --> 02:33:47.120]  and uh until last week he told me hey i want to air this segment i go great you're fully
[02:33:47.120 --> 02:33:50.480]  authorized he goes no i wouldn't alex i was talking to my producer he goes i know you let
[02:33:50.480 --> 02:33:55.280]  us play everything you're awesome i mean we love when he plays our study plays it like every week
[02:33:55.280 --> 02:34:00.000]  our special reports but he said i cbs is for the first time is shutting me down i said elaborate
[02:34:00.000 --> 02:34:04.080]  he said i don't know long i'm gonna be here and i've been talking to savage him he's always had
[02:34:04.080 --> 02:34:07.680]  like 30 minute conversations with him i've had 45 minute conversations with the guy hour long
[02:34:07.680 --> 02:34:12.640]  before you know just sitting there talking on the phone and he's never been alarmist is what i'm
[02:34:12.640 --> 02:34:18.160]  saying and i go really goes yeah i may not be on very you know soon here and then the next week
[02:34:18.160 --> 02:34:23.120]  they cut him off wabc they put guys on to make fun of him they and say we've had a coup to set him
[02:34:23.120 --> 02:34:28.240]  up to make me get mad on air he starts talking about it and they cut him off 400 stations and he's
[02:34:28.240 --> 02:34:31.920]  there on the internet finally at the end going i'm not on there i'm on there and they hadn't
[02:34:31.920 --> 02:34:37.120]  shut that off yet because he does his own internet streaming he had to leave basically from the radio
[02:34:37.120 --> 02:34:41.440]  studio he was at to another one down the street because they cut that off so i got a hand it to
[02:34:41.440 --> 02:34:46.640]  him he's actually hooked into his different you know uh areas they don't control but that happened
[02:34:46.640 --> 02:34:52.880]  and then cbs goes we don't know what's happening this is exactly how they operate and let me
[02:34:52.880 --> 02:34:57.680]  tell you the censorship is intensifying so that's why i love having somebody like steven crowner uh
[02:34:57.680 --> 02:35:01.360]  who has you know 80 year olds watch team and a lot of other folks but i have to know just from
[02:35:01.360 --> 02:35:05.680]  going to soccer games or tennis things and you like walk by and the kids are on their smartphones
[02:35:05.680 --> 02:35:10.960]  during a water break you're looking at ladderwithcrowder.com my son you know i'll see the light on
[02:35:10.960 --> 02:35:14.720]  his rooms like 2am he's in there i'm like you're supposed to be doing homework on this computer
[02:35:14.720 --> 02:35:20.560]  not watching you know ladderwithcrowder so that excites me because it's not just my son's private
[02:35:20.560 --> 02:35:26.240]  school public schools you name it and and what he was saying earlier young people i mean let's say
[02:35:26.240 --> 02:35:32.240]  10 years old to 30 35 they're really rejecting this modern cult liberalism because they weren't
[02:35:32.240 --> 02:35:37.040]  raised racist and they're sick of hearing all it's like what is this it's making them uncomfortable
[02:35:37.040 --> 02:35:42.080]  they they recognize it as authoritarianism so in the time we have with you steven let's talk about
[02:35:42.080 --> 02:35:47.360]  that because are we winning the war ask this question earlier are we winning the war or losing it
[02:35:47.360 --> 02:35:52.640]  but specifically with young people because it seems like your demographic paul watches demographic
[02:35:52.640 --> 02:35:57.760]  is say 30 years old down to about 10 and it's not embarrassing to have 10 year olds watching
[02:35:57.760 --> 02:36:02.000]  that's that's what the government wants that's what the globalist want they wish they could get
[02:36:02.000 --> 02:36:08.400]  14 year olds uh you know i mean i'll go to some tennis camp with my son or some tennis tournament
[02:36:08.400 --> 02:36:12.400]  you know in new york and you're there at breakfast and there's kids from new york and
[02:36:12.400 --> 02:36:16.240]  they're watching ladderwithcrowder that's that's exciting they're watching paul watson
[02:36:16.880 --> 02:36:19.760]  yeah well thank you first off for people watching and i'm gonna get complaints if they don't know
[02:36:19.760 --> 02:36:24.400]  this is a derogatory shirt of socialism it's a it's a parody because i can see twitter right now
[02:36:24.400 --> 02:36:28.160]  why are you supporting jake of air of course i don't um thank you i appreciate you saying that
[02:36:28.160 --> 02:36:32.480]  in the kind words i will say that's been a big thing for us in getting big guests where it turns
[02:36:32.480 --> 02:36:36.160]  out their kids are fans so people like you know i think we had ted no that's why i'm trying to get
[02:36:36.160 --> 02:36:41.360]  you on well but i appreciate it yeah i saw what you want a lot of other hosts don't so i appreciate
[02:36:41.360 --> 02:36:46.560]  it you know that's for us a lot of times hosts are like uh guys too edgy so i'm trying to turn off
[02:36:46.560 --> 02:36:50.480]  my my internet here so it doesn't screw with this feed so i appreciate it and tell your son thank
[02:36:50.480 --> 02:36:55.680]  you very much um i will say this you know to be young i guess in the sort of conservative movement
[02:36:55.680 --> 02:36:59.440]  well you know you were talking about am radio or like fox news i mean no you're the future brother
[02:36:59.440 --> 02:37:04.160]  that's i've been the guy that was the young guy this is great i mean i want to win i i hope you
[02:37:04.160 --> 02:37:08.800]  get bigger than i am oh well i i'm gosh i i don't i don't know if that's uh if that's in the cards
[02:37:08.800 --> 02:37:13.200]  but i will say you know i was at fox for a few years right and the median demo was like 72 and over
[02:37:13.200 --> 02:37:17.600]  yeah and so without getting into too much inside baseball i mean listen it's no secret that a lot
[02:37:17.600 --> 02:37:21.440]  of people there weren't big fans of what i did you can look back and you can see me wearing a suit
[02:37:21.440 --> 02:37:26.480]  and a month a jacket and i'm uncomfortable because they needed to appeal to their base and i understand
[02:37:26.480 --> 02:37:31.200]  that there's nothing wrong with that business model our average viewer is a 28 year old male
[02:37:31.200 --> 02:37:35.120]  online of the millions of people who tune in and download and stuff they're not numbers like like
[02:37:35.120 --> 02:37:39.040]  info wars but we're pretty happy that we're able to educate them and obviously i started as a
[02:37:39.040 --> 02:37:43.360]  comedian and entertainer but we really do try and bring them down the path you know our show is
[02:37:43.360 --> 02:37:48.160]  offensive to some people and i'm sure your son has talked about that but that's not the goal to me
[02:37:48.160 --> 02:37:51.840]  if that's okay that's part of why they like it though it's good because it's better than the
[02:37:51.840 --> 02:37:57.360]  daily show or mtv who some of the redstone admits is targeting my son thank god that steven
[02:37:57.360 --> 02:38:02.640]  crowder and and gavin mcginnis have him instead of uh instead of some of redstone well gosh can
[02:38:02.640 --> 02:38:06.240]  you believe trevor note why do we have a south african telling americans what they should do in
[02:38:06.240 --> 02:38:11.920]  regards to personal self-protection it is it is unreal here uh what's happening with with mtv
[02:38:11.920 --> 02:38:15.760]  and and comedy central i mean they admit it's come out that they say we're going to teach your 10
[02:38:15.760 --> 02:38:20.080]  year old how to be gay it's like i'm not against gay people but i don't want anybody talking to my
[02:38:20.080 --> 02:38:24.480]  10 year old about sex period you're gonna get punched in the nose i don't even know how wouldn't
[02:38:24.480 --> 02:38:27.680]  that go against their narrative that you don't shoot of course you don't choose to begin how do
[02:38:27.680 --> 02:38:31.680]  you teach someone to be gay it's just it's it's so silly and here's the thing too this this whole
[02:38:31.680 --> 02:38:37.200]  non-binary gender issue lgbtq aap they keep adding to the acronym like you were talking about with
[02:38:37.200 --> 02:38:40.560]  your son i well let me go back to the original question because we could we could just talk all
[02:38:40.560 --> 02:38:44.560]  day about this with the black lives matter thing oh yeah i want to bring that up boy i mean what a
[02:38:44.560 --> 02:38:50.320]  joke well here's the thing like your son you said is 11 but no no my daughter's 12 my son's 14 but
[02:38:50.320 --> 02:38:54.560]  but he's been watching you since he was about 12 okay so 14 years old here's the deal when i was
[02:38:54.560 --> 02:38:59.520]  raised um you know family matters and fresh prints were the biggest that comes around one dad was a
[02:38:59.520 --> 02:39:04.480]  black families one dad was a judge one dad was a cop these weren't black shows these weren't bet
[02:39:04.480 --> 02:39:08.560]  shows most people who watched them were white people so obviously at that point white people
[02:39:08.560 --> 02:39:12.560]  were comfortable enough and liked these family centric shows i don't think you could do that
[02:39:12.560 --> 02:39:18.320]  today when i was raised in a post-racial america slash canada um that's very different from today
[02:39:18.320 --> 02:39:21.520]  where you have people who've made everything about race i was talking about this with people
[02:39:21.520 --> 02:39:25.520]  look at charlotte when people see homeless people getting kicked if you look at uh where was it was
[02:39:25.520 --> 02:39:29.200]  it um gosh i don't know if it was dartmouth but the the video i'm sure you guys ran where she was
[02:39:29.200 --> 02:39:33.360]  and i love i love your white t is i i love i want to see you cry to the girl in the library here's
[02:39:33.360 --> 02:39:38.800]  the deal that girl who's crying um maybe she's not a racist but the guy next to her is seeing the
[02:39:38.800 --> 02:39:42.800]  black lives matter activists being violent and saying they hate white people and white devil
[02:39:42.800 --> 02:39:47.760]  and guess what he's becoming a racist and so my concern the fact that the media doesn't decry it
[02:39:47.760 --> 02:39:53.440]  and legitimizes it is going to create a bunch of white racism yes i think that this generation
[02:39:53.440 --> 02:39:58.320]  coming out the younger millennials will be far more racist than my generation or their generation
[02:39:58.320 --> 02:40:02.720]  before i agree i was raised i mean i did not hear anything racial in fact with they were my parents
[02:40:02.720 --> 02:40:06.640]  were more conservative republicans but but republicans were the folks that tried to end all this
[02:40:06.640 --> 02:40:10.560]  it was like there is some guilt we have a free market we need to hire people we need to promote
[02:40:10.560 --> 02:40:15.120]  free market we need to lift people up you know my grandma would always stop if she saw an old
[02:40:15.120 --> 02:40:18.240]  black lady walking down the road in the country and give her a ride you know there's definitely a
[02:40:18.240 --> 02:40:24.240]  white guilt there but it was we need to build these people up not not i mean my gosh black
[02:40:24.240 --> 02:40:29.280]  groups are resegregating all over the country at colleges uh it's it's sickening so where is that
[02:40:29.280 --> 02:40:34.640]  going then that is a real worry to me i do think that you could see more and this is by design right
[02:40:34.640 --> 02:40:38.640]  divide and conquer with barack obama we have a the first black president i know i thought at least
[02:40:38.640 --> 02:40:42.320]  like oh right that's happened now maybe there'll be some healing so we can actually talk about the
[02:40:42.320 --> 02:40:47.440]  issues no no it's gotten far worse and that's by design i do think you're gonna see a pendulum
[02:40:47.440 --> 02:40:51.520]  swing you're gonna see a little bit more racism unfortunately with this younger generation you
[02:40:51.520 --> 02:40:55.440]  can only have so many riots and so many hate groups and like you've talked about so much
[02:40:55.440 --> 02:41:00.800]  claiming minority racism i mean the media has said you know it's white people fault whites are
[02:41:00.800 --> 02:41:05.680]  inherently bad they have family magazines coming out saying blonde hair is evil i mean you know
[02:41:05.680 --> 02:41:11.520]  it's it's reached a crazy level i haven't heard of of that i'm not kidding i'm not kidding it says
[02:41:11.520 --> 02:41:17.600]  if you see a blonde hair blue odd family look out and go confront them about their homogeneity gosh
[02:41:17.600 --> 02:41:20.960]  well you know again look back like i was saying family matters and fresh prince when i was raised
[02:41:20.960 --> 02:41:24.160]  it wasn't even really something that was thought about no it doesn't mean we we don't need to be
[02:41:24.160 --> 02:41:27.840]  sensitive of course there's a different experience for black americans growing up and you want to
[02:41:27.840 --> 02:41:31.760]  have a dialogue and be sensitive but it's really hard to have that dialogue when they're turning
[02:41:31.760 --> 02:41:35.760]  over cop cars and by the way this isn't most black people again this is a small minority
[02:41:35.760 --> 02:41:40.560]  who've grabbed the microphone that's bustin that's bustin yes so let me ask you this then
[02:41:41.760 --> 02:41:46.800]  why did the liberal media decide because hillary even in the 2008 election she was more law and
[02:41:46.800 --> 02:41:50.720]  order and all this stuff it wasn't pushing race war things when did they decide the last four
[02:41:50.720 --> 02:41:57.840]  or five six years to just go pure race to you know the old days the kkk managed race through racist
[02:41:57.840 --> 02:42:01.600]  white people they lost that when the republicans passed the civil rights thing so they flipped
[02:42:01.600 --> 02:42:07.120]  to represent minorities but then it was this big kumbaya when did it flip double down to go with
[02:42:07.120 --> 02:42:11.600]  race-based politics with minorities that's funny you should say that because i predicted this and
[02:42:11.600 --> 02:42:15.200]  i think we saw it somewhat where it went from accusing all of your opposition of being racist
[02:42:15.200 --> 02:42:19.360]  with obama to accusing them all of being sexist with hillary and we've definitely seen that right
[02:42:19.360 --> 02:42:24.080]  all of a sudden the wage gap myth is a huge issue again everyone's talking about it and it's silly
[02:42:24.080 --> 02:42:27.760]  of course it's untrue we don't even need to give that any airtime but i think they're still continuing
[02:42:27.760 --> 02:42:33.040]  with the race issue with the clintons particularly because she's one of the weakest democratic candidates
[02:42:33.040 --> 02:42:36.400]  if you look at the black demographics because right with bill clinton they incarcerated more
[02:42:36.400 --> 02:42:40.400]  black people than ever now here's the deal they have a three strike rule i'm not even saying that
[02:42:40.400 --> 02:42:45.360]  that's necessarily a horrible thing i think if you commit three serious crimes preferably violent
[02:42:45.360 --> 02:42:49.760]  crimes not three minor infractions i think you probably should do some time however that did
[02:42:49.760 --> 02:42:53.840]  not play well with the black community so blacks are primed and ready to dislike hillary clinton so
[02:42:53.840 --> 02:42:57.920]  they were planning on going with the whole massage and his sexism wage gap and then they said oh my
[02:42:57.920 --> 02:43:01.600]  gosh the poll numbers have come in black people really don't like you as much as they like barack
[02:43:01.600 --> 02:43:06.320]  obama i know let's drum up some more race wars and i'll tell them that i'm championing their cause
[02:43:06.320 --> 02:43:11.520]  and she was even going to go to charlotte yeah with with with her hot sauce in her purse she's
[02:43:11.520 --> 02:43:15.520]  gonna fix the problem the pandering with her she doesn't even have the same accent depending on who
[02:43:15.520 --> 02:43:20.880]  she's speaking with it's just about to ask you why do you think she talks like a robot uh a hillbilly
[02:43:20.880 --> 02:43:27.360]  one day than a than a uh i mean it's bizarre all these weird accents well this is what the left
[02:43:27.360 --> 02:43:31.360]  does right they're entirely run by polls uh and that's why i have a problem with you know sort of
[02:43:31.360 --> 02:43:35.360]  this neo populist movement where i still think principles are important to a degree because
[02:43:35.360 --> 02:43:39.440]  you don't want to be like the clintons i mean look at joe biden they say they go put y'all back in
[02:43:39.440 --> 02:43:45.120]  shames what what joe why did you all of a sudden yeah why would you go we don't put y'all back in
[02:43:45.120 --> 02:43:48.960]  chains that would be very insulting it's like when rick perry went and spoke to his spanish group in
[02:43:48.960 --> 02:43:54.960]  mexico he's like hello how you do i mean i mean if you had some new yorker come to give me a speech
[02:43:54.960 --> 02:43:58.400]  i'd love them to speak in a new york accent that's why like trump being himself but if somebody came
[02:43:58.400 --> 02:44:03.920]  texas win i just got off the airplane in new york and then how you doing there alex i would be
[02:44:03.920 --> 02:44:08.400]  insulted by that yeah i think hillary clinton is one step away from going to the border wall and
[02:44:08.400 --> 02:44:13.120]  talking to the immigrants with senior wencestron in her hand so tonight we want your vote okay senior
[02:44:13.120 --> 02:44:18.240]  good job she is so awful and i think it's so plain here's the beauty though with hillary clinton
[02:44:18.240 --> 02:44:24.080]  she's so bad at it that everyone sees it so it's lifted the veil i think for a lot of people
[02:44:24.080 --> 02:44:28.640]  where they're going all right i get in the same thing with the accusations with trump of racism
[02:44:28.640 --> 02:44:32.560]  sexism everyone's going yeah but you know what you said that about mit romney and you said that
[02:44:32.560 --> 02:44:36.880]  about john mccain he said that about george w bush what do you make about lester holt 40 plus
[02:44:36.880 --> 02:44:42.240]  interruptions only six for hillary i mean that looked pretty skewed to me it did look skewed i
[02:44:42.240 --> 02:44:47.520]  will say this uh donald trump didn't clearly answer a few questions where if i were the moderator i
[02:44:47.520 --> 02:44:52.160]  would have followed up as well so i think it still was biased but i think we need to be objective
[02:44:52.160 --> 02:44:56.480]  and say all right he didn't have a great second half and he was going around and they needed to
[02:44:56.480 --> 02:45:01.200]  be caroled in and he was interrupting hillary more than she interrupted him i also understand that he
[02:45:01.200 --> 02:45:06.800]  was fighting two people uh i listen people said he was a registered republican lester holt i don't
[02:45:06.800 --> 02:45:11.920]  know how true that is and maybe he checked the balls that box the default box with the debate
[02:45:11.920 --> 02:45:16.000]  i thought donald trump was doing really well for the first 15 minutes again objectively if people
[02:45:16.000 --> 02:45:20.480]  want to tune into a show with cheerleading i'm not the guy no i agree i thought the first 25 he won
[02:45:20.480 --> 02:45:25.200]  the debate but overall it's it's really hard to tell i don't think ironically enough i don't think
[02:45:25.200 --> 02:45:30.160]  he had the stamina later on and it's like a good fighter um she's been to the championship rounds
[02:45:30.160 --> 02:45:33.440]  before you know you see that with you know joe rogan fighters are used to fighting three five
[02:45:33.440 --> 02:45:36.880]  minute rounds when you're fighting for a belt it's five five minute rounds and fighters who
[02:45:36.880 --> 02:45:41.200]  haven't been there before who look like a greek god for the first three rounds they're like a deer
[02:45:41.200 --> 02:45:45.040]  in the headlights i think we saw that a little bit with trump and maybe he'll prepare a little bit
[02:45:45.040 --> 02:45:50.560]  better so i i understand what people are saying i don't think this was as bad as a candy crowley
[02:45:50.560 --> 02:45:54.720]  moment and i don't want people to jump on every you know whether it's lester holt whether it's the
[02:45:54.720 --> 02:45:59.360]  microphone situation because even you see it in sports people will see it as whining even if
[02:45:59.360 --> 02:46:03.520]  they're legitimate drapes i'd rather see trump put his head down get to work and do better next
[02:46:03.520 --> 02:46:09.840]  time because there is room for improvement i agree with you and and look i like trump i know trump
[02:46:10.640 --> 02:46:15.600]  he's a populist uh i like the fact that he's so blunt and honest about things even things i disagree
[02:46:15.600 --> 02:46:20.000]  with the fact that he's honest about it is a major plus i've seen him change his view on things not
[02:46:20.000 --> 02:46:23.600]  flip-flop but when he's given more information and i just think he's light years better than hillary
[02:46:23.600 --> 02:46:28.080]  clinton the fact that the foreign governments the saudi's the chinese communists are against him
[02:46:28.080 --> 02:46:33.680]  um i think this is really brings it to we're about to see and i think trump will win uh unless
[02:46:33.680 --> 02:46:37.680]  there's huge election fraud uh now i want to go to a clip since you mentioned the black community
[02:46:37.680 --> 02:46:45.360]  i have to tell you i think it really is a misnomer that 90 percent of blacks really are supporting
[02:46:45.360 --> 02:46:51.680]  democrats because in my experience on the ground um it's 20 30 percent and and of all a lot of these
[02:46:51.680 --> 02:46:58.080]  classic hip-hop stars uh whether it's iced tea or ice cube they're pro-gun they see through stuff
[02:46:58.080 --> 02:47:03.360]  they're really smart here's what ice cube i had to say donald trump is what americans love about
[02:47:03.360 --> 02:47:08.880]  the american dream and then he talks about hillary and the point you made about super predators here
[02:47:08.880 --> 02:47:17.120]  is ice cube well you know donald trump is what americans love donald trump is what americans
[02:47:17.120 --> 02:47:25.440]  aspire to be rich powerful do what you want to do say what you want to say be how you want to be
[02:47:26.160 --> 02:47:34.720]  that's kind of been like the the the american dream so he looks like a boss to everybody and
[02:47:34.720 --> 02:47:42.240]  americans love to have a boss so you know that's his appeal to me so there you go what do you
[02:47:42.240 --> 02:47:47.520]  make of that mr crocker come on afterwards and say by the way i think trump is horrible and he
[02:47:47.520 --> 02:47:51.840]  said so people took me out of context so i do want to be fair with that however it does show you that
[02:47:52.480 --> 02:47:55.920]  there is a mob mentality where i think you're right i think there are a lot more particularly
[02:47:55.920 --> 02:48:00.240]  if you go to a church like my family uh they go to church that's very mixed probably 40
[02:48:00.240 --> 02:48:04.640]  percent white probably 30 black and then you know everything else kind of filed in the middle
[02:48:04.640 --> 02:48:08.320]  um you'll have people who will step out and say well because of my principles i can't vote for
[02:48:08.320 --> 02:48:12.800]  hillary clinton and then they are scoria i mean they lose family members they won't talk to them
[02:48:12.800 --> 02:48:17.280]  anymore if they come out and say it so well sure trump's got problems but i mean hillary is a master
[02:48:17.280 --> 02:48:22.080]  james bond criminal who's been caught lying and blowing up countries and working with radical
[02:48:22.080 --> 02:48:26.480]  islam i mean she she's so evil i can't even believe it quite frankly no i think you're
[02:48:26.480 --> 02:48:30.800]  absolutely right uh my point is in the black community even with that being said if they come
[02:48:30.800 --> 02:48:34.960]  out and that even sounds like they're being positive about republicans it's just not allowed in the
[02:48:34.960 --> 02:48:40.000]  black community there's major bullying there is major bullying and so uh i think those numbers
[02:48:40.000 --> 02:48:43.600]  would be different if they here's one thing you want to talk about white privilege here's one thing
[02:48:43.600 --> 02:48:48.400]  i was talking with tommy stodemire on my show i do have a privilege in the sense that as a white
[02:48:48.400 --> 02:48:53.120]  person i can be called stupid or racist for being a republican however as a black person you are
[02:48:53.120 --> 02:48:59.120]  entirely expected to be a democrat your entire life and if you go against it it causes rifts
[02:48:59.120 --> 02:49:02.640]  in families and friends and that's one thing i don't envy with a lot of black people who are
[02:49:02.640 --> 02:49:06.960]  thinking independently who may go for trump or may go for gary johnson if they're not going for
[02:49:06.960 --> 02:49:12.160]  hillary clinton they're going to have a tough go with their circle of friends exactly and i i'm
[02:49:12.160 --> 02:49:16.480]  going to be honest i grew up in the gateway you know from the west of the south in in texas you
[02:49:16.480 --> 02:49:20.640]  know east texas is the south the south as it gets the rest is you know the west i mean we really
[02:49:20.640 --> 02:49:27.440]  are in the middle here and i grew up where i never heard racist talk i mean even under the breath stuff
[02:49:27.440 --> 02:49:36.720]  um in fact i saw white gill i mean i saw salvation army i saw donating i saw free medical care you
[02:49:36.720 --> 02:49:42.240]  know i saw it all what which i get you try to lift up people and try to fix rifts not even if you're
[02:49:42.240 --> 02:49:46.320]  guilty just you try to do the right thing right once we get around democrats and traveling around
[02:49:46.320 --> 02:49:50.080]  the country and getting behind closed doors it's like you think they're testing you when they start
[02:49:50.080 --> 02:49:55.680]  saying all those racist stuff they go no i am like that and you're like wow and then you realize wait
[02:49:55.680 --> 02:50:02.320]  just 40 50 years ago these guys were the kkk and i mean it's just crazy to watch blacks and minorities
[02:50:02.320 --> 02:50:07.680]  worshiping them because they're selling a race-based system to them which is i guess tribal when you
[02:50:07.680 --> 02:50:12.960]  you know the history closing comments 60 seconds oh gosh 60 seconds i i think you're right about that
[02:50:12.960 --> 02:50:17.760]  i think it's unfortunate more people don't know about it i will say this if racism is just as rampant
[02:50:17.760 --> 02:50:22.720]  as people talk about this is anecdotal i've heard the n word used once once seriously my life and
[02:50:22.720 --> 02:50:27.520]  was by a kid in west virginia at a bob evans when i was doing a show and i was like oh my god i couldn't
[02:50:27.520 --> 02:50:32.480]  believe that i heard it which just made me realize how rare it actually was in my interactions with
[02:50:32.480 --> 02:50:37.680]  democrats including people who are in current office by the way or left to shows the racism the
[02:50:37.680 --> 02:50:43.280]  prejudice of soft expectations of assuming that these people are incapable and that they need
[02:50:43.280 --> 02:50:48.080]  them to come that's the real racism is that these people have to be taken care of i see that so much
[02:50:48.080 --> 02:50:53.360]  and it is it is grossly offensive to use the word it is it is they want to control us it's modern

[02:54:25.280 --> 02:54:31.760]  saw comey during the break on national news the fbi director being grilled over the fact by
[02:54:31.760 --> 02:54:34.880]  republicans that they never intended to go after hillary they gave them all immunity it was all
[02:54:34.880 --> 02:54:42.160]  staged representative nadler asked the fbi about something i was told about three weeks ago by roger
[02:54:42.160 --> 02:54:47.520]  stone we're getting on the line right now and then i had already been contacted by some pentagon
[02:54:47.520 --> 02:54:53.440]  sources and others saying listen you've got the justice department looking at you and i said for
[02:54:53.440 --> 02:55:02.640]  what and they were like um threats to hillary and and and russia now i know my phones are tapped
[02:55:02.640 --> 02:55:08.080]  too there's a lot of weird stuff's been going on and i mean i have no connection to russia other
[02:55:08.080 --> 02:55:10.880]  than the fact that russia doesn't want to be able to do well or neither do i i mean it's just it's
[02:55:10.880 --> 02:55:16.480]  just crazy okay it's crazy there's a lot more i don't want to get into here obviously the leaks
[02:55:16.480 --> 02:55:21.120]  we've gotten are from like the secret service and stuff but i told you this is this is dangerous
[02:55:21.120 --> 02:55:25.600]  what we're doing okay we're not playing deadly winks that's why we need your prayers we need your

[02:55:44.800 --> 02:55:48.640]  sabbage we're going to play his last two interviews with us or clips of it the next hour with david
[02:55:48.640 --> 02:55:51.840]  night but we're going to play a clip we're not to break and then come back with roger stone some
[02:55:51.840 --> 02:55:57.120]  stations don't care the fourth hour a lot do info wars.com forward slash show but this is from
[02:55:57.120 --> 02:56:00.640]  media matters which is the white house you got david brock connected to all this and
[02:56:00.640 --> 02:56:06.880]  and bezzlement and you know taking money and and and going around the 501c3 and all the rest of it
[02:56:06.880 --> 02:56:13.760]  that's okay but then the fact that roger stone they're trying to claim works for the russians
[02:56:13.760 --> 02:56:19.600]  and by extension that that we're being looked at for the russians just shows how crazy this has gotten
[02:56:20.240 --> 02:56:24.720]  so let's play two minutes of this exchange come back to roger stone here in just a moment
[02:56:24.720 --> 02:56:28.720]  that we just got on the line this just happened about 30 minutes ago here it is questions about
[02:56:28.720 --> 02:56:34.160]  that in his earlier remarks uh mr kanya's reference in august 30th letter from the ranking members of
[02:56:34.160 --> 02:56:38.560]  a number of house committees that letter asked whether the fbi was investigating troubling
[02:56:38.560 --> 02:56:43.520]  connections between trump campaign officials and russian interests and whether they contributed
[02:56:43.520 --> 02:56:47.680]  to the illegal hacking of the democratic national committee and the democratic uh
[02:56:47.680 --> 02:56:51.920]  national campaign committee you're familiar with that letter i think yes i'm familiar with the letter
[02:56:51.920 --> 02:56:57.760]  i'd like to ask you a few questions the letter said this and i quote on august 8th 2016 roger stone
[02:56:57.760 --> 02:57:03.440]  a donald trump confidant revealed that he has communicated with wikileaks founder julian assange
[02:57:03.440 --> 02:57:09.680]  about the upcoming release of additional illegally hacked democratic documents mr stone made these
[02:57:09.680 --> 02:57:13.600]  statements during a republican campaign event while answering a question about a potential
[02:57:13.600 --> 02:57:18.880]  october surprise obviously if someone is stating publicly that he is in direct communication with
[02:57:18.880 --> 02:57:24.320]  the organization that obtained these illegally hacked documents i assume the fbi would want to
[02:57:24.320 --> 02:57:29.600]  talk to that person as the fbi interviewed roger stone about his communications with julian assange
[02:57:29.600 --> 02:57:34.240]  or his knowledge of how wikileaks got these illegally obtained documents i can't comment on that
[02:57:35.360 --> 02:57:38.880]  mr stone stated that he has knowledge about upcoming leaks of additional
[02:57:39.840 --> 02:57:45.360]  illegally hacked documents has the fbi asked him about those communications i also can't comment on
[02:57:45.360 --> 02:57:49.680]  that because it's an ongoing investigation i don't want to confirm whether there is or is not an
[02:57:49.680 --> 02:57:54.000]  investigation that that's why that's the way i answered mr conures's questions as well director
[02:57:54.000 --> 02:57:59.440]  comey the fbi acknowledged in private in public statements and testimony that it was acknowledged
[02:57:59.440 --> 02:58:04.080]  that it was investigating secretary clinton's use of a private email server and that was while the
[02:58:04.080 --> 02:58:08.640]  investigation was still ongoing now you can't comment on whether there's an investigation is
[02:58:08.640 --> 02:58:13.280]  there a different standard for secretary clinton and donald trump if not what is the consistent
[02:58:13.280 --> 02:58:18.320]  standard no our standard is we do not confirm or deny the existence of investigations is an
[02:58:18.320 --> 02:58:23.840]  exception for that when there is a need for the public to be reassured obvious it's apparent given
[02:58:23.840 --> 02:58:28.800]  our activities public activities that the investigation is ongoing but our overwhelming
[02:58:28.800 --> 02:58:33.440]  rule is we do not comment except in except that's enough we're gonna go to break come back with
[02:58:33.440 --> 02:58:37.920]  roger stone in 70 seconds and again it's one thing to be told about this i think to actually see it
[02:58:37.920 --> 02:58:42.080]  happening they're trying to claim trump is a russian agent ladies and gentlemen and when you've seen
[02:58:42.080 --> 02:58:47.040]  them on national news say that i'm a russian agent with with with trump and uh what's the other uh
[02:58:47.040 --> 02:58:53.600]  guy uh uh vladimir putin over the years there have been a lot of powerful advancements in the field

[03:00:06.720 --> 03:00:17.040]  live from austin texas broadcasting
[03:00:28.800 --> 03:00:33.360]  well if you just joined us we've started the fourth hour here i was going to air
[03:00:33.360 --> 03:00:36.160]  here larjex serves for the last two interviews with uh
[03:00:38.880 --> 03:00:43.280]  former cbs talk show host i guess michael sabbage who got taken off the air in new york and then
[03:00:43.280 --> 03:00:47.840]  nationwide when he complained monday for talking about hillary's health problems and the fact that
[03:00:47.840 --> 03:00:56.320]  wikileaks says she had uh Parkinson's uh medication but now we have global government forming global
[03:00:56.320 --> 03:01:01.280]  is running our nation and then if we want nationalism like the briggs it like the uk does
[03:01:01.280 --> 03:01:07.280]  us we're russian agents and they even said forage is a russian agent so if the eu doesn't
[03:01:07.280 --> 03:01:11.520]  want to you know be kicked out of england they just come and say you're a russian agent same
[03:01:11.520 --> 03:01:16.080]  thing with the globalist here in america we've been occupied by this roger stone this is getting
[03:01:16.080 --> 03:01:21.520]  crazy especially when you and others privately told me uh that the justice department was poking
[03:01:21.520 --> 03:01:26.400]  around you know claiming that we're russian agents i was then told this by two different sources
[03:01:26.400 --> 03:01:33.440]  separately they said man there the democrats are sending letters to the justice department and
[03:01:33.440 --> 03:01:39.520]  they're concurring and sending it to the fbi and others who investigate you for basically insurrection
[03:01:39.520 --> 03:01:44.240]  and working for the russians now i was told this last week by a source and another source this week
[03:01:44.240 --> 03:01:50.000]  and these are good sources so this has reached a level of authoritarianism that is over the top
[03:01:50.000 --> 03:01:54.560]  there is no doubt if hillary gets in she's coming after us i mean this is ridiculous what do you
[03:01:54.560 --> 03:02:01.040]  say to the charge of we're working for the russkis well this would be laughable if it wasn't so
[03:02:01.040 --> 03:02:09.600]  outrageous this is the the new mccarthyism i mean congressman jerry nadler is a pathetic hat uh and
[03:02:09.600 --> 03:02:16.400]  a shill for hillary clinton willing to overlook all of her legal activities to try to launch a
[03:02:16.400 --> 03:02:24.880]  witch hunt to non-existent uh activities i have no connections to the russians i don't work for
[03:02:24.880 --> 03:02:32.240]  the russians i'm not in touch with the russians i am not compensated by the russians my loyalties to
[03:02:32.240 --> 03:02:41.040]  the united states of america if the fbi would like to investigate my ties to wiki leaks or the russians
[03:02:41.040 --> 03:02:49.360]  there welcome to do so they'll find nothing untoward or illegal uh i have as i've said on
[03:02:49.360 --> 03:02:56.400]  this program many times had a back channel communications with usage through an intermediary
[03:02:57.120 --> 03:03:03.680]  simply for the purpose of gleaning information as to what he may or may not and by the way you
[03:03:03.680 --> 03:03:08.640]  got hacked your bag everything because of that yes but you know i didn't hear from the fbi when
[03:03:08.640 --> 03:03:17.600]  i got hacked uh or when they uh destroyed my contacts uh or destroyed other uh investigative
[03:03:17.600 --> 03:03:23.520]  documents i was working on or invaded my bank account where there were actual
[03:03:24.080 --> 03:03:31.040]  thefts of thousands of dollars in illegal transfers the fbi didn't seem to be too concerned about that
[03:03:32.400 --> 03:03:38.400]  on august 21st a bunch of democratic hacks cosigned a letter to comey demanding that i
[03:03:38.400 --> 03:03:44.560]  be investigated these are intimidation tactics that will not work and let me ask you this question
[03:03:44.560 --> 03:03:48.560]  i mean obviously we brought this up privately uh but just you know in a vague way that we were both
[03:03:48.560 --> 03:03:53.520]  under investigation i've been told this too before this even came out and i'm just sitting here i'm
[03:03:53.520 --> 03:04:00.160]  not even upset about it it's so ridiculous that i'm a russian spy i mean give me a break well as
[03:04:00.160 --> 03:04:06.000]  nitsi said that which does not kill me makes me stronger alex every time they attacked you and
[03:04:06.000 --> 03:04:13.120]  hillary clinton attacked you by name in a speech which i'm jealous about i gotta be honest they're
[03:04:13.120 --> 03:04:18.480]  only boosting your viewership which i think is probably tripled in the last couple weeks every
[03:04:18.480 --> 03:04:22.720]  time they attacked you they just underlined the fact that you're a truth teller and every time
[03:04:22.720 --> 03:04:29.120]  they attacked me and want i agree but i mean it's like effective in bringing down the globalists
[03:04:29.120 --> 03:04:32.800]  i agree let's come back badge of honor let's come back and play a short clip of this and then
[03:04:32.800 --> 03:04:36.560]  talk about what this means 40 days until the election what are the other dirty tricks they're
[03:04:36.560 --> 03:04:41.840]  going to play and i guess it's just a form of intimidation you know it's like we're investigating
[03:04:41.840 --> 03:04:45.760]  you and that picture we're investigating what you did here we're watching you and it's just like
[03:04:45.760 --> 03:04:50.240]  i know you're watching me all i want to do is get our country back can you people just stop

[03:08:15.440 --> 03:08:27.760]  you're listening to the alex jones only 40 days left i'm your host alex jones this is the info
[03:08:27.760 --> 03:08:32.640]  war i got so much to talk about this works out with roger stone just an hour or so ago
[03:08:33.200 --> 03:08:37.760]  this was the fbi director it's a big national news story coming up with papers everywhere
[03:08:37.760 --> 03:08:44.080]  and they've got it with with with headlines roger stone wiki leaks russian agent and again
[03:08:44.080 --> 03:08:47.600]  i've been getting the calls people saying man people are going around asking if you're planning
[03:08:47.600 --> 03:08:52.560]  an overthrow of the country with the russians i mean they're really trying to sell this crazy idea
[03:08:53.280 --> 03:08:57.120]  and this just shows these are globalists selling our country out and they're saying
[03:08:57.120 --> 03:09:02.480]  we've sold out to the russians because russia's one nationalist country like the uk fighting back
[03:09:02.480 --> 03:09:07.360]  against this takeover i'm not a british agent either i just i don't want globalism running me
[03:09:07.360 --> 03:09:15.440]  yes okay uh here's a clip 2016 roger stone a donald trump confidant revealed that he has
[03:09:15.440 --> 03:09:19.920]  communicated with wiki leaks founder julien assange about the upcoming release of additional
[03:09:19.920 --> 03:09:25.200]  illegal of additional illegally hacked democratic documents mr stone made these statements during
[03:09:25.200 --> 03:09:29.520]  a republican campaign event while answering a question about a potential october surprise that's
[03:09:29.520 --> 03:09:33.520]  what journalists do obviously if someone is stating publicly that he is in direct communication
[03:09:33.520 --> 03:09:39.120]  with the organization that obtained these illegally hacked documents i assume the fbi would want to
[03:09:39.120 --> 03:09:44.480]  talk to that person as the fbi interviewed roger stone about his communications with julien assange
[03:09:44.480 --> 03:09:48.400]  or his knowledge of how wikileaks illegally it goes on and on and the director says he won't
[03:09:48.400 --> 03:09:52.720]  answer it because there's an ongoing investigation roger you've been public you're a journalist
[03:09:52.720 --> 03:09:57.600]  you run stokeholdtrip.com you're a bestselling author you said through an intermediary you're
[03:09:57.600 --> 03:10:02.560]  trying to check info you got on hillary with assange you've always been out in the open
[03:10:03.120 --> 03:10:08.880]  we've contacted and talked to assange before we've talked to you know nigel ferrage you name it uh
[03:10:09.760 --> 03:10:14.560]  this is crazy i mean i have nsa whistleblowers on i mean i'm going to be investigated because i'm
[03:10:14.560 --> 03:10:22.080]  a journalist go ahead yeah it has a cost to ask quality to it but here's what i would say to congressman
[03:10:22.080 --> 03:10:30.400]  nadler as alger has said to to richard dixon when he was in congress jerry say it outside the immunity
[03:10:30.400 --> 03:10:37.120]  of your congressional office and i will sue your fat ass so fast your head will spin go ahead
[03:10:37.120 --> 03:10:42.080]  accuse me of treason let's let's find it out in the federal courtroom instead of hiding behind
[03:10:42.080 --> 03:10:50.400]  your congressional immunity this is an absurdity uh and we now have a political fbi and a political
[03:10:50.400 --> 03:10:58.000]  cia uh that have been entirely politicized and now seem to be extensions of the clinton campaign
[03:10:58.720 --> 03:11:05.280]  uh it's insulting if it worked so ridiculously absurd roger did you get like her chief of staff
[03:11:05.280 --> 03:11:10.480]  or she did a 35 million dollars from the russian government to sign over concessions to one fifth
[03:11:10.480 --> 03:11:15.760]  of us uranian when you were secretary of state that's the real irony here the only one who's actually
[03:11:15.760 --> 03:11:23.520]  in touch with putin the only one who's done errands for the clique around him are the presidents who
[03:11:23.520 --> 03:11:31.360]  as you just pointed out took millions in order to assign the uranium concessions 70 of our production
[03:11:31.360 --> 03:11:37.040]  to uh to a russian conglomerate that is controlled by the kremlin and by the way by the way i don't
[03:11:37.040 --> 03:11:41.040]  want to get mainstream media credit but the last six months or so there's been a bunch of articles
[03:11:41.040 --> 03:11:47.600]  even the wall street journal uh even the associated press admitting that investigation showed massive
[03:11:47.600 --> 03:11:51.360]  hillary connections to the russians which is their interest that's what they're doing
[03:11:51.360 --> 03:11:55.200]  i'm not saying we shouldn't be tougher on them i mean you know they're like the chinese you know
[03:11:55.200 --> 03:11:59.760]  going to these traders and you know selling us out but it's not trump it's hillary and wiki
[03:11:59.760 --> 03:12:07.200]  leak says we've got the documents no russian connection to trump zero and no russian connection
[03:12:07.200 --> 03:12:14.160]  to wiki leaks for that that's the other canard here uh julian assigned is not working for the russians
[03:12:14.160 --> 03:12:21.040]  or the chinese or the americans he's working for himself he's working against the deep state which
[03:12:21.040 --> 03:12:26.000]  is why i think he's a hero he is a hero uh who's teller there's no doubt he's a hero he has gone
[03:12:26.000 --> 03:12:31.760]  through hell uh okay right now they have these pumped up charges of sexual assault against him
[03:12:31.760 --> 03:12:36.960]  which is completely fraudulent and now before the swedish supreme court it's merely an attempt
[03:12:36.960 --> 03:12:42.960]  to silence him it's so ridiculously obvious look alex i think they're particularly upset
[03:12:43.520 --> 03:12:49.200]  because my book the clinton's war on women's out in paperback this week it is selling gang
[03:12:49.200 --> 03:12:58.160]  busters it is now affordable to send to women i'm going to send pdf versions to uh women voters
[03:12:58.160 --> 03:13:04.400]  in key states by email this is driving them insane but they need to read the first amendment
[03:13:04.400 --> 03:13:08.000]  and then when they're figured we need to reread it well that's the truth they have a big raging
[03:13:08.000 --> 03:13:12.480]  heart on for you because they know your talking points are reality-based the opposite of a dirty
[03:13:12.480 --> 03:13:18.160]  trick and that trump's listing the world's listing and most of what trump has scored giant points on
[03:13:18.160 --> 03:13:22.320]  quite frankly came right from roger stowe and i'm very proud some of it came from me obviously
[03:13:22.320 --> 03:13:26.800]  trump researched and resonated with it he's his own man but let's just say it they figured out
[03:13:26.800 --> 03:13:31.120]  where the real points are getting scored against them and they're pissed yeah i think that i think
[03:13:31.120 --> 03:13:36.800]  that's essentially true and let's be clear we're not even close to finished yet don't try to call
[03:13:36.800 --> 03:13:44.400]  this race 40 days out there are some very large events happening that are going to expose hillary
[03:13:44.400 --> 03:13:51.280]  clinton and her husband uh and this race is far from over now what we have is this giant
[03:13:52.400 --> 03:13:56.880]  group thing going on in the mainstream media i watched the debate and then i read today's
[03:13:56.880 --> 03:14:01.920]  news times it's obvious to me that they must have watched a different debate trump won every poll
[03:14:01.920 --> 03:14:08.400]  but seeing in and i would say he won it moderately it blew up in their face that it was so rigged so
[03:14:08.400 --> 03:14:13.440]  he ended up winning bigger but well and can she debate it all without in your piece because that
[03:14:13.440 --> 03:14:18.240]  that's my question she clearly had it so so so did halt we've confirmed that uh let me ask you
[03:14:18.240 --> 03:14:22.320]  this question then i mean i think from the polls we're seeing trump is still moderately head and
[03:14:22.320 --> 03:14:27.200]  swing states he's not as good as he was a week ago i would call this kind of a you know pyrrhic
[03:14:27.200 --> 03:14:31.600]  victory he had at the debate he says he's going to be a lot more hardcore uh you're always very
[03:14:31.600 --> 03:14:35.760]  honest you said this is trumps to lose trump is going to be the winner you said that two weeks ago
[03:14:35.760 --> 03:14:42.640]  is that still the case well it's a little early to gauge the outcome of the debate because you
[03:14:42.640 --> 03:14:48.640]  can't measure the speed of the wind in the eye of the storm you have to wait until things settle down
[03:14:48.640 --> 03:14:56.320]  but uh i had i addressed a political science class last night at the university of maryland
[03:14:56.320 --> 03:15:05.920]  apartment east of the university of miami 350 students uh and uh i spoke to a very prominent
[03:15:06.800 --> 03:15:15.680]  democratic holster who i respect prior to this and he told me the new surveys that he has seen
[03:15:15.680 --> 03:15:23.920]  show trump surging among his panics now at about 35 percent uh in key states i would remind you
[03:15:23.920 --> 03:15:31.200]  mitt romney topped out at 29 this is why they're so panicky trump it was on the move remains to
[03:15:31.200 --> 03:15:38.480]  be seen what the result was of last night or monday night's debate that said i don't expect
[03:15:38.480 --> 03:15:45.280]  a seismic change you might have a small incremental change but anybody who thinks this race is
[03:15:45.280 --> 03:15:51.040]  over or that trump we doesn't have adequate opportunities to gain ground doesn't understand
[03:15:51.040 --> 03:15:57.520]  american politics let's talk about our october surprises uh we do have one that's going to be
[03:15:57.520 --> 03:16:01.440]  an october surprise we're gonna go ahead and release it in october uh and that's what's got
[03:16:01.440 --> 03:16:06.080]  them freaked out is that uh we're not with wiki leaks we're checking facts with wiki leaks if
[03:16:06.080 --> 03:16:10.480]  we're able to uh but that that's coming out in the next few days we'll just release it now it's
[03:16:10.480 --> 03:16:14.080]  so it's it is dangerous it's not that big a deal it's actually confirmed and known but it just
[03:16:14.080 --> 03:16:17.840]  brings it back up what are some of the other october surprises we've got cooking i mean not
[03:16:17.840 --> 03:16:22.640]  specifically but why they should be worried and what do you think they may do clearly quadrupling
[03:16:22.640 --> 03:16:28.800]  down with race riots tripling down with division george soros forward foundation hundreds of millions
[03:16:28.800 --> 03:16:33.440]  you know to take every unfortunate event and hype it up uh what are some of their other surprises
[03:16:33.440 --> 03:16:39.360]  wars i know they've had articles and in cnn and others going oh trump this is gonna win there's
[03:16:39.360 --> 03:16:44.560]  something big about to happen that'll really shake him and hillary what's the inside baseball
[03:16:44.560 --> 03:16:52.000]  roger stone uh i think that we're that there's an orchestrated attack today by this um hispanic
[03:16:52.000 --> 03:17:00.080]  former miss universe that appears to me largely to be uh disinformation hillary put her thumb
[03:17:00.080 --> 03:17:06.000]  prints all over this in the debate you could see the trump was kind of taken by surprise i think
[03:17:06.000 --> 03:17:13.200]  that's because the entire thing is fictional uh my major concern let me just say i like her at 160
[03:17:13.200 --> 03:17:19.600]  instead of 110 i like her juicy yeah well i'm the same way because you know baby got back but just
[03:17:19.600 --> 03:17:26.080]  the same uh my still my major concern continues to be the rigging of this election and therefore
[03:17:26.800 --> 03:17:34.560]  we are very shortly at stop the steel going to unveil a very detailed exit poll program for
[03:17:34.560 --> 03:17:40.800]  which we have already signed up thousands of volunteers and we will we need more but we have
[03:17:40.800 --> 03:17:47.680]  we have working with political scientists and mathematicians come up with an exit poll program
[03:17:47.680 --> 03:17:55.360]  that will allow us to immediately gauge whether there has been vote rigging and reveal it on
[03:17:55.360 --> 03:18:02.320]  info wars dot com so the world will know uh giving trump the basis on which to challenge the
[03:18:02.320 --> 03:18:08.000]  elections results if in fact he's been cheated now that cannot be done without hard evidence
[03:18:08.000 --> 03:18:12.640]  but i think if it happens the hard evidence will be had sure sure we've got all if you just
[03:18:12.640 --> 03:18:19.440]  mentioned the former poster child uh her poster child is a porn star who admitted that she was
[03:18:19.440 --> 03:18:27.040]  the getaway driver for a bank robbery so this lady's running around when she was miss universe
[03:18:27.040 --> 03:18:30.400]  she gained a bunch of weight wasn't doing her job trump wanted to renegon paying her
[03:18:30.400 --> 03:18:34.720]  because she wasn't doing her job he says she's become a little piggy she eats too much well i mean
[03:18:34.720 --> 03:18:38.800]  that's the case big deal if you got a model that's supposed to be doing work for you and she gains a
[03:18:38.800 --> 03:18:42.880]  bunch of weight and then trump gets out of the contract calling her mrs piggy i mean big deal
[03:18:42.880 --> 03:18:48.320]  i mean hillary has muslims chopping women's genitals off well i guess my question is is that
[03:18:48.320 --> 03:18:54.560]  less objectionable to the fact that bill clinton raped and bit wanita broadrick and then hillary
[03:18:54.560 --> 03:19:00.720]  challenge got threatened at wanita to her face squeezed her hand so hard it hurt and essentially
[03:19:00.720 --> 03:19:07.040]  told her to keep her mouth shut so and i think uh there are similar stories by cathleen willie
[03:19:07.040 --> 03:19:12.800]  whose home is broken into whose children are absolutely roger stone whose cars are big car
[03:19:12.800 --> 03:19:19.920]  is vandalized or or or paula jones who got an eight hundred and fifty thousand dollar civil
[03:19:19.920 --> 03:19:25.280]  settlement payment from the clinton's after he after which he was suspended from the practice
[03:19:25.280 --> 03:19:31.280]  of law if any of the allegations about trump and miss universe more serious than those
[03:19:31.280 --> 03:19:36.240]  transgressions i don't think so well we need to get more comfortable in this country to
[03:19:37.120 --> 03:19:42.320]  sit there and joke around and do things like this and it's just one sided playing field where it's
[03:19:42.320 --> 03:19:46.960]  like we're in junior high oh he called somebody you know a little piggy or they're eating too much
[03:19:46.960 --> 03:19:51.120]  like a pig because they've gained 50 pounds you know he's like hey you're getting a bunch of weight
[03:19:51.120 --> 03:19:56.080]  you're not out there doing a job for miss universe but let's be candid about what's happened everything
[03:19:56.080 --> 03:20:02.560]  that the clintons do everything is carefully polled and focused group and around table so this whole
[03:20:03.360 --> 03:20:10.400]  attack on trump has is aimed at a specific cohort of women within the voters and it may and it may
[03:20:10.400 --> 03:20:16.240]  test well but this is gained and making women that are overweight mad but it will not test as well
[03:20:16.240 --> 03:20:22.160]  as one eat abroad rick when she goes public uh because she's imminently more believable
[03:20:22.160 --> 03:20:29.600]  than hillary clinton or paula jones or cathleen willie or sandra alan james or liz ward grace
[03:20:29.600 --> 03:20:38.320]  it or eileen wellstone etc etc etc who's an abuser of women not down trump hillary and bill clinton
[03:20:38.320 --> 03:20:44.160]  that's who well i want to invite this lady in studio will fly her here we want to get her here
[03:20:44.160 --> 03:20:48.400]  on in studio just to just discuss how evil trump is i think you'll get them all alex i think they're
[03:20:48.400 --> 03:20:54.880]  all anxious to talk i think they were waiting till october and i believe saturday's october first well
[03:20:54.880 --> 03:20:59.200]  let's have the victims of this all on and then have this this porn start laying on and ask her
[03:20:59.200 --> 03:21:02.960]  you know was him calling you a little piggy saying you're eating a little too much is why i got out
[03:21:02.960 --> 03:21:06.560]  of your contract and you know i mean obviously if you're in a contract to be skinny and we're in a
[03:21:06.560 --> 03:21:11.920]  bathing suit you go gain 50 60 pounds you know trump got out of the contract so that i mean i
[03:21:11.920 --> 03:21:17.200]  i loved how they were sitting there bitching going there was an architect that trump said violated
[03:21:17.200 --> 03:21:21.440]  a contract and he's here tonight he didn't get paid full price for a clubhouse meanwhile this
[03:21:21.440 --> 03:21:26.320]  woman has wrecked countries because hundreds of thousands of Christians cattle future scams murders
[03:21:26.320 --> 03:21:33.280]  death been part of obama care been gauzy all these other crimes the glass steagle act they got rid of
[03:21:33.280 --> 03:21:38.960]  the banking crisis she's one of the big authors and then she's blaming him over a clubhouse when
[03:21:38.960 --> 03:21:45.200]  this woman i would have been out trump should have said i'm bad you only gave 5.7 of the money
[03:21:45.200 --> 03:21:51.760]  for Haitian refugees to charity you kept 90 plus percent you pig sorry i know black lives matter
[03:21:51.760 --> 03:21:58.960]  unless of course you live in Haiti or libya but i guess if the fbi director comey and his bureau
[03:21:58.960 --> 03:22:04.400]  aren't too busy investigating me they might want to look into why hillary took 10 million dollars
[03:22:04.400 --> 03:22:12.640]  from ukrainian billionaire victor pinchuk and then approved pinchuk's goons driving the democratically
[03:22:12.640 --> 03:22:18.960]  elected president of ukraine whose election we recognized as a country out of office at gunpoint
[03:22:18.960 --> 03:22:24.880]  not in an election not by impeachment but at gunpoint and and let's go further let's go further
[03:22:24.880 --> 03:22:30.000]  we we have this administration involved the saudi arabians and all the corruption they're
[03:22:30.000 --> 03:22:36.800]  involved it just goes on and on well i let's here's how i would wrap this up alex you said correctly
[03:22:36.800 --> 03:22:42.160]  if they're elected they're coming after us well let me say this if they're elected we're coming
[03:22:42.160 --> 03:22:48.400]  after them this fight doesn't end on november 3rd unless donald trump is elected and then frankly
[03:22:48.400 --> 03:22:53.280]  he can clean up the mess that they have created well let's take ukraine i mean and then we'll close
[03:22:53.280 --> 03:23:02.080]  the son of the vice president as soon as they are with the country took over the multi billion
[03:23:02.080 --> 03:23:07.920]  dollar a month worth tens of billions a year gas company that the russian gas passes through and
[03:23:07.920 --> 03:23:13.760]  began grabbing hundreds of millions for himself on record why is it the fbi investigating the vice
[03:23:13.760 --> 03:23:20.000]  president giving his son the contract over the stolen gas i mean these people the clinton stole
[03:23:20.000 --> 03:23:27.360]  and stole george washington's china okay they are the lowest white trash filth you can imagine
[03:23:29.120 --> 03:23:35.440]  that's why i say lock her up to be continued all right roger stone both the bill clinton
[03:23:35.440 --> 03:23:39.760]  rape shirt and hillary for prison shirts both limited editions are available at info war store
[03:23:39.760 --> 03:23:44.080]  dot com roger will talk to you soon great to be here alex many thanks you bet i'm gonna hand
[03:23:44.080 --> 03:23:49.760]  them a ton today but not who's been waiting in the wings we've got segments of the interviews we've
[03:23:49.760 --> 03:23:54.880]  done the last two weeks with uh with michael sabbage because he's off the air now and he
[03:23:54.880 --> 03:23:58.800]  didn't know he won't talk to anybody i don't know what's going on all it was he told me cbs was
[03:23:58.800 --> 03:24:02.720]  censoring the week before it happened uh and i mean i got up but we go away people are more
[03:24:02.720 --> 03:24:08.160]  concerned about it because uh this is just crazy uh david night what do you make of all this going
[03:24:08.160 --> 03:24:12.400]  on i mean this is really really getting nuts because i don't go on here and tell people that
[03:24:12.400 --> 03:24:16.320]  i've been told that the justice department's investigating me for plans to overthrow the
[03:24:16.320 --> 03:24:20.880]  government even though they've already overthrown our government uh and then we're russian agents uh
[03:24:22.000 --> 03:24:25.680]  i don't even really speak a word of russian i'm just gonna say gulosh that's pretty tasty
[03:24:25.680 --> 03:24:31.840]  like a soup or something uh like a roast soup or something my mom makes but i mean it's just crazy
[03:24:31.840 --> 03:24:36.400]  to watch these globalists that have sold the country out to multinationals calling us russian
[03:24:36.400 --> 03:24:42.880]  agents so david night alex uh what uh we just heard about roger stone being brought up in the fbi
[03:24:42.880 --> 03:24:47.920]  hearings i already had on my list of things to cover here comey cronyism and the fact that he
[03:24:47.920 --> 03:24:53.520]  was going to be brought before congress today to ask uh uh answer questions about his specialized
[03:24:53.520 --> 03:24:58.160]  treatment of hillary clinton his wall street journal pointed out it really has become a kid
[03:24:58.160 --> 03:25:04.640]  glove exercise but uh that that's the real issue alex is that the fbi has become politicized even
[03:25:04.640 --> 03:25:11.360]  politico who is totally in the tank for hillary clinton has talked about how he has politicized
[03:25:11.360 --> 03:25:17.440]  the fbi uh unlike anything that we've seen since jagger hoover and and that is a fact if you go back
[03:25:17.440 --> 03:25:23.600]  and you look at the close connections between loretta lynch and james comey that go back far
[03:25:23.600 --> 03:25:28.960]  before they became attorney general and fbi director they were part of a law firm they used to do the
[03:25:28.960 --> 03:25:34.240]  clinton's taxes yeah these are clinton minions that have been put in place that's right to carry all
[03:25:34.240 --> 03:25:40.320]  this out and and they allowed and they allowed sandy burger the guy who as part of the 9 11
[03:25:40.320 --> 03:25:44.480]  investigations wanted to cover up some information out of congress he's stuck he went to the national
[03:25:44.480 --> 03:25:49.360]  archive stuffed documents in his clothes down his pants took him out and destroyed him he got off
[03:25:49.360 --> 03:25:53.360]  without anything happening to him who was in charge of that investigation loretta lynch
[03:25:53.360 --> 03:25:59.280]  and james comey that is precisely what hillary clinton has been doing it was a a small example
[03:25:59.280 --> 03:26:02.800]  a physical example of what hillary clinton has been doing with this other stuff well they're
[03:26:02.800 --> 03:26:06.240]  arrogant they think they're invincible even if they steal this election they just discredit
[03:26:06.240 --> 03:26:09.520]  themselves i'm going to hand the baton over to you in some segments we might be able to air it all

[03:26:59.120 --> 03:27:03.200]  about earlier i was already had it on my uh list of things to talk about first thing i want to
[03:27:03.200 --> 03:27:06.960]  talk about was james comey and this article from the wall street journal points out that
[03:27:06.960 --> 03:27:11.360]  today he was uh going before the house judiciary committee uh they said he'll get another chance
[03:27:11.360 --> 03:27:17.200]  to explain his agency's double standard regarding hillary clinton and they pointed out that uh we
[03:27:17.200 --> 03:27:22.560]  had a lot more documents that were released on friday evening this is the way he does it every
[03:27:22.560 --> 03:27:28.320]  time there's a holiday with fourth of july or labor day or weekends that's when he releases
[03:27:28.320 --> 03:27:33.120]  the information now what are we seeing lately okay we've seen that the fbi granted immunity
[03:27:33.120 --> 03:27:39.280]  to clinton's top aides chief of staff cheryl mills senior advisor heather samuelson uh
[03:27:39.280 --> 03:27:46.160]  they did that in order to get them to surrender their laptops and as some of these congressmen are
[03:27:46.160 --> 03:27:51.360]  saying you just take the laptops from anybody else you don't have to give them immunity deals
[03:27:51.360 --> 03:27:57.040]  and why does the fbi give people immunity deals they always do that to people who are further down
[03:27:57.040 --> 03:28:02.160]  so they can get information to get the people who are running the riko operation or the criminal
[03:28:02.160 --> 03:28:06.320]  operation they always get it give immunity to the people lower down so they can get details
[03:28:06.960 --> 03:28:11.360]  to get the people at the top yet we've seen this before with the clinton's remember back in the
[03:28:11.360 --> 03:28:17.600]  1990s when we had the scandals with charlie tree and so forth charlie tree was given immunity at
[03:28:17.600 --> 03:28:22.960]  that time they found out everything that charlie tree knew and yet they didn't go after the clinton's
[03:28:22.960 --> 03:28:28.480]  at the top even though he implicated them so again we're seeing these people like charlie mills
[03:28:28.480 --> 03:28:34.720]  heather samuelson are given immunity so that they'll merely hand over their laptop and as the
[03:28:34.720 --> 03:28:39.600]  lawyer for these two they both have the same lawyer incidentally as she said the immunity deals were
[03:28:39.600 --> 03:28:44.480]  designed to protect her clients against any related classification disputes now the wall street
[03:28:44.480 --> 03:28:51.920]  journal says this is an admission that both women knew their unsecured laptops had been holding
[03:28:51.920 --> 03:28:57.200]  sensitive information for more than a year in other words violating national security but say
[03:28:57.200 --> 03:29:02.000]  meanwhile uh the fbi waited until late friday to dump more documents from some investigation that
[03:29:02.000 --> 03:29:08.800]  raised even more questions was the fbi concerned that miss mill in the fall of 2013 after congress
[03:29:08.800 --> 03:29:14.320]  began investigating benghazi called mr pagliano to ask about software that could be used for
[03:29:14.320 --> 03:29:19.360]  wiping computer data or that plat river network's employee after getting instructions from miss
[03:29:19.360 --> 03:29:23.920]  mill to begin deleting clinton emails that were more than 60 days old entitled the resulting work
[03:29:23.920 --> 03:29:29.360]  ticket the hillary cover-up operation well today he told them even before he started talking about
[03:29:29.360 --> 03:29:35.360]  roger stone and alex jones the uh the red scare that they're trying to gin up here he said no no
[03:29:35.360 --> 03:29:40.960]  no that wasn't a cover-up at all asking for information about covering up stuff for a vip
[03:29:40.960 --> 03:29:49.840]  isn't a cover-up we're not weasels he said yeah they are stay with us we'll be right back we're on
[03:29:49.840 --> 03:30:01.680]  the march the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network new information is coming
[03:30:01.680 --> 03:30:07.520]  forth about the terrorist omar matine who killed 49 people and wounded 53 others in the gay orlando
[03:30:07.520 --> 03:30:12.320]  nightclub attack a transcript of the conversation between matine and the police negotiator has
[03:30:12.320 --> 03:30:16.800]  been released and it sheds new light on matine's motivation for the murders matine was triggered
[03:30:16.800 --> 03:30:21.920]  by a pentagon drone strike a month before the attack he told the negotiator saying quote yo
[03:30:21.920 --> 03:30:27.040]  the airstrike that killed abu wahid a few weeks ago that's what triggered it okay they should not
[03:30:27.040 --> 03:30:33.040]  have bombed and killed abu wahid he also identifies himself as a follower of isis now initial reports
[03:30:33.040 --> 03:30:38.640]  from several news outlets reported matine had described himself as gay but he was a homophobe
[03:30:38.640 --> 03:30:42.800]  and a wife beater despite him making claims that he belonged to isis the new york times
[03:30:42.800 --> 03:30:47.920]  stated three days after the massacre that quote the precise motivation of matine remains unclear
[03:30:47.920 --> 03:30:52.320]  now the false narrative was perpetuated for a week the president himself attempting to paint
[03:30:52.320 --> 03:30:57.360]  omar matine as a lone wolf shooter anything responsible but radical islam i'm margaret

[03:33:28.960 --> 03:33:34.240]  some excerpts from when michael savage talked to alex jones just a couple of days ago now why
[03:33:34.240 --> 03:33:39.920]  are we doing this it's because the authoritarian left is coming out with every day we see a new
[03:33:39.920 --> 03:33:45.520]  form of censorship what happened on monday was that michael savage began discussing hillary clinton's
[03:33:45.520 --> 03:33:49.600]  health issues he thinks that it's parkinson's disease as he got into that discussion and of
[03:33:49.600 --> 03:33:54.800]  course this is the day of the big debate coming up as soon as he got into that the big station
[03:33:54.800 --> 03:34:04.400]  wabc radio tv in new york shut him off and then put on a lesser-rated curtis and cubie show shortly
[03:34:04.400 --> 03:34:09.280]  after that he found out that he'd been shut off in new york and he began talking about it to the
[03:34:09.280 --> 03:34:15.120]  remainder of his audience and he's got 400 stations to 20 million listeners he starts talking about
[03:34:15.120 --> 03:34:21.920]  it to the other 399 stations and then they cut him off nationwide see that's the way they handle
[03:34:21.920 --> 03:34:27.280]  this another example of this very small example but still very significant remember donald trump
[03:34:27.280 --> 03:34:32.560]  jr tweeted out a skittles meme that said hey here's a bowl of skittles have you told you three of
[03:34:32.560 --> 03:34:38.240]  these are poison would you take a handful he said that's our syrian refugee pro problem the fact
[03:34:38.240 --> 03:34:46.000]  that we cannot vet which ones are okay and which ones are violent criminals and that has created
[03:34:46.000 --> 03:34:50.640]  a big stir and now they have removed that tweet again they don't want to debate it they just
[03:34:50.640 --> 03:34:55.840]  want to censor it that's the authoritarian left they've removed that tweet saying that they have
[03:34:55.840 --> 03:35:02.000]  a copyright violation of the image that was used in that meme understand that is fair use what he
[03:35:02.000 --> 03:35:08.800]  did there it is not only political commentary but it is also satire both of those either one of those
[03:35:08.800 --> 03:35:14.000]  would be protected speech but both of those together would protect that nevertheless they
[03:35:14.000 --> 03:35:18.560]  take that down because that's the kind of censorship ship you see that's what we see happen to uh paul
[03:35:18.560 --> 03:35:24.720]  joseph lottson's video last week and yet it gets bigger when they do that but here's alex jones
[03:35:24.720 --> 03:35:29.680]  and michael savage talking about uh the issues just this last week the same issues that we've
[03:35:29.680 --> 03:35:35.440]  now seen happen this week how many more attacks have to happen from muslims till we realize that
[03:35:35.440 --> 03:35:39.440]  it's not happening in a vacuum and it's not happening because of evil donald donald trump or
[03:35:39.440 --> 03:35:44.560]  because of michael savage or alex jones you know on my facebook i get this from the idiots the
[03:35:44.560 --> 03:35:48.080]  liberals they say you know if we didn't provoke them if we didn't put them down if we didn't
[03:35:48.080 --> 03:35:53.520]  demonize them they wouldn't do it and i have to patiently say study your history islam has been
[03:35:53.520 --> 03:35:59.280]  a war with the world for 1400 years they don't learn that at harvard they don't learn that at
[03:35:59.280 --> 03:36:06.080]  yale they don't learn anything so they don't know that islam is a warlike militant political
[03:36:06.080 --> 03:36:13.040]  machine and they've used the first amendment freedom of religion to infiltrate and conquer
[03:36:13.040 --> 03:36:17.440]  every nation they've ever entered in this country for example i was thinking about that this morning
[03:36:17.440 --> 03:36:22.640]  at dawn alex i had an amazing sunrise this morning on san francisco bay it looked like fire i put it
[03:36:22.640 --> 03:36:29.760]  up on my facebook page it was one of those fire sunrises and all i could think about was how not
[03:36:29.760 --> 03:36:37.200]  the trojan horse metaphor but specifically freedom of religion and i said wait a minute
[03:36:37.920 --> 03:36:41.920]  there are limitations on freedom of speech aren't there in other words you can't yell kill this or
[03:36:41.920 --> 03:36:46.960]  kill that you'd be taken off the air in one second and probably arrested i have limitations i have an
[03:36:46.960 --> 03:36:51.840]  internal auditor in my head a internal sensor i don't say certain things because i know that i
[03:36:51.840 --> 03:36:59.040]  wouldn't last in the business for 22 years so who says that religion should be protected 100%
[03:36:59.040 --> 03:37:03.680]  by the first amendment for example what if psychos wake up one day as they have and they say they're
[03:37:03.680 --> 03:37:09.760]  a witch in their religion well then hey you got warlocks now practicing witchcraft in the army
[03:37:09.760 --> 03:37:14.640]  this is showing you how sick the country has become fine well now let's say someone comes up with a
[03:37:14.640 --> 03:37:20.720]  religion and says my religion says you can kill anyone who's not like us is that a religion sure
[03:37:20.720 --> 03:37:25.440]  you got the protection of your religion how about i could rape young children sure it's a religion
[03:37:25.440 --> 03:37:29.760]  no it isn't so in other words if a religion woke up or created or someone created religion of
[03:37:29.760 --> 03:37:34.320]  child molesting everyone say i'm sorry that's not a religion if religion said you can kill anyone
[03:37:34.320 --> 03:37:39.520]  who's not like you to say that's not a religion really we'll look into islam it says kill the
[03:37:39.520 --> 03:37:47.600]  infidel in about 73 different places if you find the infidel slashes throat kill the jew kill the
[03:37:47.600 --> 03:37:55.280]  christian kill the apostate so i'm saying right now what moderate muslims are saying and i've had
[03:37:55.280 --> 03:37:59.760]  some of these people on mainly they're women by the way i've often said alex only the muslim
[03:37:59.760 --> 03:38:03.760]  women could save us from these animals why are we bringing people from countries that are in
[03:38:03.760 --> 03:38:09.360]  perpetual war the most radical muslim countries with these sunnis and mohabias where they're
[03:38:09.360 --> 03:38:13.680]  constantly just killing themselves killing their wives and daughters pouring ass on each other's
[03:38:13.680 --> 03:38:20.160]  faces they're clearly lunatics they're clearly under a 1400 year cult and so we shouldn't be
[03:38:20.160 --> 03:38:25.120]  bringing people here from the region of cult crazies how many muslims have come in on the
[03:38:25.920 --> 03:38:30.400]  obama clinton she was secretary of state i think the number was something like 681
[03:38:30.400 --> 03:38:35.200]  000 muslims have been brought in on the hillary clinton now how many of them i keep hearing
[03:38:35.200 --> 03:38:39.920]  most of them are peaceful fine okay most of them are peaceful so what is it one percent are radicals
[03:38:39.920 --> 03:38:45.600]  what's one percent of 700 000 rounded off a lot of people oh what what 10 do it for do the math
[03:38:45.600 --> 03:38:50.400]  fast we should do in the fifth grade 700 000 10 percent of 70 000 one percent percent of 7 000
[03:38:50.400 --> 03:38:56.000]  there's about 7 000 the demo now 7 000 radicals they brought in so it's no way savage no it's not
[03:38:56.000 --> 03:39:02.560]  one percent of muslims are radical no no it's 0.1 percent archers not 7 000 it's only 700
[03:39:02.560 --> 03:39:09.360]  so they brought in 700 more terrorists no savage it's not 0.1 percent it's 001 percent all right
[03:39:09.360 --> 03:39:14.640]  so it's not 70 it's seven you see what i'm saying but you still but we know the numbers this latest
[03:39:14.640 --> 03:39:20.720]  group decades ago it was heretics it was people that did actually want to live in a freer country
[03:39:20.720 --> 03:39:25.600]  in most cases who are fleeing islam and we're just islamic with their roots i've studied i
[03:39:25.600 --> 03:39:31.360]  know you've studied i've had scholars on now it's the worst third world areas that they're coming
[03:39:31.360 --> 03:39:35.680]  out of where they're constantly killing each other it's a bunch of sunnis who invaded syria
[03:39:35.680 --> 03:39:40.160]  got their butt kicked and now are coming through turkey into europe into the united states interpol
[03:39:40.160 --> 03:39:45.280]  admits as you know dr savage 80 percent are military age men and when they do polls in europe
[03:39:45.280 --> 03:39:52.880]  upwards of 35 percent say they will support jihad and suicide bombing now so 35 percent are terrorists
[03:39:53.600 --> 03:39:58.320]  tell me that one of these things has not magnified under this cretin in the white house
[03:39:58.320 --> 03:40:06.320]  is this not becoming a third world nation of terror check yes riots check black lives matter
[03:40:06.320 --> 03:40:13.280]  mobs check black lives matter chaos check barack obama terror riots mobs and chaos this is a novelty
[03:40:13.280 --> 03:40:18.240]  in american history i haven't seen anything like this historically since the 60s and before that
[03:40:18.240 --> 03:40:22.320]  when was the last time you've seen america like this and the beauty of all of this alex is how he's
[03:40:22.320 --> 03:40:28.800]  gotten away with it because you've got to give him credit barry obama is the slickest salesman
[03:40:28.800 --> 03:40:36.560]  of communism the world has ever ever discovered no screaming no yelling no threats just a silk
[03:40:36.560 --> 03:40:42.640]  smooth good-looking nice guy with a lovely wife and children selling the most evil poison the
[03:40:42.640 --> 03:40:49.200]  world has ever ever been asked to ingest and look how far he's gotten and every time he gets away
[03:40:49.200 --> 03:40:55.200]  with another outrage against this nation he raises the stakes like a junkie he needs a higher dose
[03:40:55.200 --> 03:41:01.440]  of insult in order to maintain the high am i wrong alex you're dead on mr. savage dr. savage please
[03:41:01.440 --> 03:41:08.160]  continue so the question is okay i'm i'm complaining about him i'm saying she's worse which is true
[03:41:08.160 --> 03:41:14.480]  which is a ludicrous she says america wants change from what from the same policies she's
[03:41:14.480 --> 03:41:20.000]  going to continue she's suddenly not a progressive lunatic when we're waiting she's going to change
[03:41:20.000 --> 03:41:25.520]  obama's policies in which way make them worse how she can't go the other way and then she'd be
[03:41:25.520 --> 03:41:30.800]  donald trump so it means she's going to make it even worse than him that's if she remembers what
[03:41:30.800 --> 03:41:34.560]  she's supposed to do and that's doubtful as you well know because she doesn't know how many times
[03:41:34.560 --> 03:41:41.840]  she fainted uh so the point is how do we uncouple this insanity it is going to be really hard
[03:41:41.840 --> 03:41:47.920]  hard you know and i know there was a ueck in the 1950s and it's a dirty word of the most dirty of
[03:41:47.920 --> 03:41:54.000]  words the house of unamerican activities committee which was run by one of the great american patriots
[03:41:54.000 --> 03:42:00.720]  senator mccarthy he has been completely decimated by the left mccarthy was a tail gunner in world
[03:42:00.720 --> 03:42:05.680]  war two one of the most dangerous positions you could ever have in an airplane right belly gunner
[03:42:05.680 --> 03:42:12.000]  b-24 men's easiest target was the tail that's what they attacked listen what the left did to him they
[03:42:12.000 --> 03:42:15.840]  called them they mocked them and called them tail gunner joe and others they took his heroism
[03:42:15.840 --> 03:42:20.560]  and tried to turn it into a mockery that was in the 50s alex to show you who they were already
[03:42:20.560 --> 03:42:27.440]  the communists so what was mccarthy saying this great war hero he was saying that hollywood had
[03:42:27.440 --> 03:42:33.440]  been infiltrated by communists the journalists haven't infiltrated by communists academia had
[03:42:33.440 --> 03:42:39.680]  been infiltrated by communists and the government itself well what happened was they had the hearings
[03:42:39.680 --> 03:42:46.160]  they ruined him they destroyed the man and then what happened in the 1990s i'm sure you remember
[03:42:46.160 --> 03:42:52.160]  the book the venona papers came out it was a soviet russian publication turned out it was all
[03:42:52.160 --> 03:42:57.280]  true the russian documents came out it was worse so what mccarthy was saying worse it confirmed
[03:42:57.280 --> 03:43:03.840]  who in hollywood who in academia who in government was in fact an operative of the soviet union
[03:43:04.720 --> 03:43:11.520]  so they were subversives uak was exactly on target i say the only way we can save this nation
[03:43:11.520 --> 03:43:16.800]  is not talking about it but by rooting out the subversives in the united states of america
[03:43:16.800 --> 03:43:21.440]  if you look at the globalist if you look at their leftist they're saying the alt right can't be
[03:43:21.440 --> 03:43:25.680]  tolerated they're saying we need to be shut down and arrested hillary says she's going to shut down
[03:43:25.680 --> 03:43:30.240]  right bark that means drudge you they say they're bringing back fairness doctrine they say they're
[03:43:30.240 --> 03:43:36.560]  coming after us they're run by this foreign globalist soros russia's already kicked him out these are
[03:43:36.560 --> 03:43:43.600]  foreign globalist here overthrowing our country so one of the constitution these aren't even citizens
[03:43:43.600 --> 03:43:49.680]  they don't have the rights they're here overthrowing the system to survive we must go on the offensive
[03:43:49.680 --> 03:43:54.240]  we must root them out it's the only way to ever beat them they are criminals they are subversives
[03:43:54.240 --> 03:43:59.680]  they are solowinsky pledging to lucifer please continue now the man behind all of it is george
[03:43:59.680 --> 03:44:04.880]  soros the most evil man on the planet in my estimation the absolutely most evil person
[03:44:04.880 --> 03:44:08.800]  the world has seen in modern times you know you don't have to hang people electrocute them put
[03:44:08.800 --> 03:44:13.360]  him in cages you don't have to do the things that isis is doing to be evil he's evil on a larger
[03:44:13.360 --> 03:44:18.560]  scale than the isis executioners are because he's gutting the united states of america he's trampling
[03:44:18.560 --> 03:44:22.880]  on our constitutions he helped fund the airspring he helped fund the airspring hillary all of them
[03:44:22.880 --> 03:44:27.840]  hillary clinton was the publicist and an actor along with john carrey i say she was a quarterback
[03:44:27.840 --> 03:44:33.120]  with carrey and obama she destroyed the middle east she owns that how does the media forget the
[03:44:33.120 --> 03:44:37.360]  media why doesn't trump put her on a cross with that one by the way mr sabbage dr sabbage that's
[03:44:37.360 --> 03:44:42.720]  not hyperbole he literally destabilized 20 something countries that al qaeda and isis are
[03:44:42.720 --> 03:44:46.560]  running around hundreds of thousands of dead christians they won't even let christians out of
[03:44:46.560 --> 03:44:52.000]  the region it's these people are demons just like the true liberal assigns said look i've got the
[03:44:52.000 --> 03:44:57.760]  documents the press is dead if she gets in our necks are in uses she's a demon you must stop her
[03:44:58.720 --> 03:45:04.960]  i hear you and i also saw who wrote the other day that obama the nice slick smooth nice family
[03:45:04.960 --> 03:45:10.000]  man has created the greatest surveillance state in the history of the world and suddenly liberals
[03:45:10.000 --> 03:45:14.640]  are afraid of it because they understand what happens when the guillotine stops it starts
[03:45:14.640 --> 03:45:19.440]  falling first it takes out your opposition but as i'm as the world learned during the french
[03:45:19.440 --> 03:45:24.880]  revolution the guillotine has an unlimited taste for blood and it doesn't stop with the enemies of
[03:45:24.880 --> 03:45:29.840]  the revolution then they turn on their own kind and start executing their own so so-called counter
[03:45:29.840 --> 03:45:34.880]  revolutionaries as was done in the soviet union always happens as was done and as was done in cuba
[03:45:34.880 --> 03:45:39.440]  as was done in hitlers germany they killed their own the brown church and the guillotine keeps falling
[03:45:39.440 --> 03:45:44.080]  and cuts heads it is the most thirsty instrument on earth and that's why the left ought to step up
[03:45:44.080 --> 03:45:49.440]  and shut their fat mouths when we stand up to these monsters these monsters need to be stopped or
[03:45:49.440 --> 03:45:54.800]  we're all finished left right and center you mentioned a key word there google for weeks i've
[03:45:54.800 --> 03:45:59.920]  been railing against the monopolies that have emerged in america under obama the dictator google
[03:46:00.480 --> 03:46:06.320]  facebook or microsoft of course had been there before look at these companies they're violating
[03:46:06.320 --> 03:46:11.520]  the antitrust statutes of the united states legal system there is an antitrust division
[03:46:11.520 --> 03:46:17.600]  of the u.s justice department it does not touch mark zuckerberg does not touch the google voice
[03:46:17.600 --> 03:46:22.400]  does not touch bill gates and there's a reason because they all support the globalist new world
[03:46:22.400 --> 03:46:28.800]  order agenda they support it to the nth degree and i've been screaming that when trump becomes
[03:46:28.800 --> 03:46:34.080]  president he must reactivate and use the justice department to break up these monopolies and give
[03:46:34.080 --> 03:46:40.320]  other people a chance to build a business and i make a point of teddy roosevelt who was a populist
[03:46:40.320 --> 03:46:45.920]  as you well know and his campaign slogan was bust the trusts the trusts in his day were standard
[03:46:45.920 --> 03:46:52.080]  oil Rockefellers railroads and oil company company that dominated railroads and dominated the oil
[03:46:52.080 --> 03:46:56.000]  business they didn't give anyone a chance of emerging if they did they crushed us the same
[03:46:56.000 --> 03:47:02.640]  globalist grandkids today that are running globalism zuckerberg 58 billion dollars isn't enough for
[03:47:02.640 --> 03:47:07.600]  that pig he needs to cut the wages of american workers and throw them out of the country and
[03:47:07.600 --> 03:47:12.240]  bring in indians will work for one third the wage god bless india god bless their intelligence
[03:47:12.240 --> 03:47:16.960]  god bless it but we gotta look out for us a little bit they they belong in india let them let them
[03:47:16.960 --> 03:47:21.760]  rebuild their own economy and let them hire it workers at a right at a right salary so yeah you
[03:47:21.760 --> 03:47:28.480]  want to talk about jobs why do you think i'm not you i'm talking about sure why do you think
[03:47:28.480 --> 03:47:35.600]  trump is surging amongst the blue collar disenfranchised white male why because they've been dumped
[03:47:35.600 --> 03:47:41.760]  upon they've been stepped upon the eddies whose grandfather's defeated hitler the eddies whose
[03:47:41.760 --> 03:47:47.440]  father's died in the jungles of vietnam are being crapped upon by these vermin these cowardly vermin
[03:47:47.440 --> 03:47:51.840]  these sick deviant perverts i can't stand it i'll get worked up and i don't want to i'm trying not
[03:47:51.840 --> 03:47:57.920]  to alex this is the first interview i've done wow for this book thank you and alex i gotta tell you
[03:47:57.920 --> 03:48:01.200]  you're you're on the front lines you're gonna be around a lot longer than i am in the media and
[03:48:01.200 --> 03:48:07.360]  probably on this planet and you're doing the job that needs to be done and all i can say is as the
[03:48:07.360 --> 03:48:13.760]  time comes to an end right here when i say that obama and the left are practicing a scorched
[03:48:13.760 --> 03:48:19.600]  earth policy there's a reason for it when an army retreated in the past they burnt everything to
[03:48:19.600 --> 03:48:25.200]  the ground they burnt the crops they killed a livestock they burned the barn scores is that
[03:48:25.200 --> 03:48:29.840]  not what's going on here with this left when they see an ascendant right and ascendant americans
[03:48:29.840 --> 03:48:35.120]  that's right they're blowing it all up they're burning our they're burning our pathways to survival
[03:48:35.120 --> 03:48:40.080]  they're burning our internet they want to burn radio they want to burn any access to trying to
[03:48:40.080 --> 03:48:45.200]  start race war they're saying kill the cops are getting away with everything i keep saying which
[03:48:45.200 --> 03:48:50.560]  soros gave them 70 million dollars to those street thugs all we need now is obama to
[03:48:51.760 --> 03:48:58.640]  turn them into his well-funded private army he can deputize them and give them government arms
[03:48:58.640 --> 03:49:04.560]  as he did isis and then you will have the young pioneers of the soviet union you will have the
[03:49:04.560 --> 03:49:10.640]  red brigades you will have the red brigades of communist china frightening everybody in the
[03:49:10.640 --> 03:49:18.640]  society uh on a daily basis we cannot continue to rely only on our military in order to achieve
[03:49:18.640 --> 03:49:23.840]  the national security objectives that we've set we've got to have a civilian national security
[03:49:23.840 --> 03:49:30.640]  force that's just as powerful just as strong just as well funded alex with that close to it all
[03:49:30.640 --> 03:49:37.920]  coming to that obama is not finished yet he has several months left yet to burn it all down alex
[03:49:37.920 --> 03:49:42.000]  i agree we've only got a minute left then in your gut you're a smart cookie doctor savage
[03:49:42.000 --> 03:49:47.600]  what do you expect them to pull remember what george bush did in the last few months of his regime
[03:49:47.600 --> 03:49:51.920]  i was screaming and warning george bush as a fiscal socialist he's not through yes do you
[03:49:51.920 --> 03:49:57.440]  remember the housing advice that followed i expect that if it looks like trump is going to win or
[03:49:57.440 --> 03:50:02.640]  grandma falls off the stage again for good and they replace it with uh uh freddy from one of the
[03:50:02.640 --> 03:50:08.560]  nightmare movies kane who can't win i expect the worst i expect them calling off the election
[03:50:09.120 --> 03:50:15.360]  i expect martial law i expect if that is not possible i expect a financial complete financial
[03:50:15.360 --> 03:50:20.000]  breakdown to create even further chaos that's what i expect i've always been for free speech to the
[03:50:20.000 --> 03:50:24.240]  most radical level the problem is they're all organizing and saying they want to shut down
[03:50:24.240 --> 03:50:28.480]  talk radio they want to shut down matt drudge they want to shut down bright bard hillary says the
[03:50:28.480 --> 03:50:33.440]  alt right that means michael savages the dean does not have a right to exist when you start hearing
[03:50:33.440 --> 03:50:40.000]  final solution literal nazi rhetoric that i don't have a right to exist i've got a black heart
[03:50:40.000 --> 03:50:44.800]  you're evil matt drudge is evil i'm done listen you come here you overthrow the country you bring
[03:50:44.800 --> 03:50:49.360]  in radical muslims do you want to arrest me the gloves are off we're going to try in front of a
[03:50:49.360 --> 03:50:53.520]  jury we're going to lock your asses up you want it we're going to find out who the trainers are go
[03:50:53.520 --> 03:50:59.920]  ahead alex you know the left was famous at adge adge prop i believe after this election whoever
[03:50:59.920 --> 03:51:05.760]  wins we need to have a people's tribunal and have mock trials of hillary clinton john carrey
[03:51:06.320 --> 03:51:11.440]  george soros all of the names that we know are involved with destroying our sovereignty and going
[03:51:11.440 --> 03:51:16.400]  after our first amendment there's nothing prohibiting such adge prop you can be the prosecutor
[03:51:16.400 --> 03:51:23.680]  who you know i'm not good as a lawyer i can't even imitate lawyers but the thing is alex listen
[03:51:23.680 --> 03:51:27.440]  we got to slow down there's a lot of work to be done because if trump wins and it looks like he
[03:51:27.440 --> 03:51:32.880]  could easily win unless they do one of two things and i'm terrified of either of the options one is
[03:51:33.680 --> 03:51:37.760]  the most horrible possibility if it looks like he's going to beat her you know they're not letting
[03:51:37.760 --> 03:51:45.920]  him get to the finish line let's let that hang in the air number two let us say he wins well
[03:51:45.920 --> 03:51:53.040]  what happens then he is surrounded by neocons they have already triangulated trump you saw
[03:51:53.040 --> 03:51:58.880]  that last week he already brought in the i think was on show last week the former head of the cia under
[03:51:59.520 --> 03:52:06.720]  was it uh uh uh came on criticized uh uh uh trump the former head of the cia under under uh uh
[03:52:06.720 --> 03:52:13.040]  clinton he's using him as an advisor you're right it was it was sure that that's uh woolsey
[03:52:13.040 --> 03:52:18.400]  yes yes woolsey why would he choose him i'm already concerned about the whole
[03:52:19.120 --> 03:52:23.040]  trump will be on my radio show today by the way alex he's he's scheduled to be on
[03:52:23.680 --> 03:52:27.360]  and we're going to talk about terror terror terror terror he's called for profiling today
[03:52:27.360 --> 03:52:32.880]  incidentally which of course is commonsensical isn't every cop in the world i love the newspaper
[03:52:32.880 --> 03:52:37.120]  articles in the san francisco area they never show a perk unless he's got blonde hair and blue eyes
[03:52:38.320 --> 03:52:42.640]  uh can't find the perpetrator you have to search by the way in sweden and germany they admit that
[03:52:42.640 --> 03:52:47.840]  even when it's a muslim they replace it with a barred out image of a blonde-haired german and i
[03:52:47.840 --> 03:52:50.720]  interrupted you earlier when you were talking about how we collaborate with subversives when
[03:52:50.720 --> 03:52:55.040]  you're a multinational war criminal former nazi collaborator that's collapsed dozens of countries
[03:52:55.040 --> 03:52:59.920]  like george soros what do you do when a foreign power a foreign group comes in and is trying to
[03:52:59.920 --> 03:53:04.000]  overthrow your country what do we do these subversives just briefly and then let's get back into i
[03:53:04.000 --> 03:53:09.040]  agree they're going to try to block trump getting in he's surging his wave is turned into a tsunami
[03:53:09.040 --> 03:53:13.360]  he's winning most of the battleground states what are they going to do why do you think blacks are
[03:53:13.360 --> 03:53:18.480]  coming over to him because they know she's a liar i i predicted six months ago the hispanic males
[03:53:18.480 --> 03:53:23.680]  in particular will move to trump already happening for two reasons i use commonsense i i know these
[03:53:23.680 --> 03:53:28.800]  guys very well they're a macho culture number one they don't like an old woman telling him what to
[03:53:28.800 --> 03:53:35.680]  do let alone a woman number two what is an hispanic worker want he wants what everyone else wants
[03:53:35.680 --> 03:53:40.240]  i see them around construction sites every day a bicycle buy and talk to the to the pit crews
[03:53:40.240 --> 03:53:44.960]  the foreman these guys are building from six o'clock in the morning they're the carpenters
[03:53:44.960 --> 03:53:48.800]  they're the plumbers they're the drywall you know i'm saying and what do they have the minute they
[03:53:48.800 --> 03:53:53.120]  get some money they buy a pickup truck they get some more money they try to buy a little house in
[03:53:53.120 --> 03:53:58.960]  a far out suburb i go to kfc on on a weekend sometimes who do i see there hispanic men
[03:53:58.960 --> 03:54:02.880]  with their wives their little daughters dressed up in a little dress they just came from church
[03:54:02.880 --> 03:54:07.440]  there's something beautiful there out there's rather american cars yeah but they don't want to be
[03:54:08.800 --> 03:54:13.280]  what they left behind in their hellhole their third world polluted hellhole
[03:54:13.280 --> 03:54:17.760]  they want the american dream so who was their role model they want to be like donald trump
[03:54:17.760 --> 03:54:22.480]  they know they can't achieve that but maybe they could be a little bit like him maybe some of his
[03:54:22.480 --> 03:54:26.800]  money and concept of making money rubble their grandkids could be like trump i mean it took that
[03:54:26.800 --> 03:54:31.440]  long for trump too that's right that's right in other words same in all of our families uh my
[03:54:31.440 --> 03:54:36.560]  grandfather was an immigrant uh actually my father was an immigrant sorry not even my grandfather
[03:54:36.560 --> 03:54:40.240]  i'm first generation american and i keep saying i have one foot in the old world one foot in the
[03:54:40.240 --> 03:54:46.080]  new so i i do recognize how hard it is to be an american if you just get here but we were taught
[03:54:46.080 --> 03:54:51.600]  learn english work hard you'll succeed and if you don't just decide what way it is then maybe
[03:54:51.600 --> 03:54:55.280]  and mr savage have you succeeded in everything i mean you've been successful in publishing
[03:54:55.280 --> 03:55:03.120]  media real estate you name it it took me 30 years of struggle and being rejected 1978 i earned my
[03:55:03.120 --> 03:55:08.000]  phd from the University of california at berkeley with straight a's not one university would hire
[03:55:08.000 --> 03:55:14.400]  me because i was the dreaded white male they hired inferior in every case they hired women
[03:55:14.400 --> 03:55:21.120]  minorities and immigrants and the acnu proudly said some americans will have to put their lives
[03:55:21.120 --> 03:55:28.240]  on hold so others may move ahead you don't know what it's like to to shame yourself like i did i i
[03:55:28.240 --> 03:55:32.560]  had a sense of failure that no one will ever know i don't want anyone to know i was on the verge of
[03:55:32.560 --> 03:55:38.560]  suicide but i wouldn't do it because of my children i couldn't do that i felt i had failed my ancestors
[03:55:38.560 --> 03:55:43.520]  that after all this hard work i couldn't even get a goddamn job teaching in the university
[03:55:43.520 --> 03:55:49.360]  because of the racism induced by the illegitimate filthy scum called progressives but they force you
[03:55:49.360 --> 03:55:55.360]  out into the real world where you dominated academia could be the real world in some real
[03:55:55.360 --> 03:55:59.280]  science no i mean absolutely but i'm saying they force you to build your own world and look how
[03:55:59.280 --> 03:56:04.720]  much bigger it was than in their world i'm the worst nightmare they ever had i have more of an
[03:56:04.720 --> 03:56:08.960]  audience in one minute of my show than i would have in one year in a university that's exactly
[03:56:11.920 --> 03:56:16.000]  and again that was michael savage with alex jones back on september 13th
[03:56:16.000 --> 03:56:21.920]  today is uh what 28th that's about two weeks ago and you heard michael savage say uh facebook
[03:56:21.920 --> 03:56:25.360]  they're going to take people down we saw that happen now within the last two weeks we saw that
[03:56:25.360 --> 03:56:31.520]  happened with paul joseph watson's video which uh they took down on youtube uh he then put it up on
[03:56:31.520 --> 03:56:35.680]  facebook this time uh facebook didn't get involved in the censorship it was youtube but it's going
[03:56:35.680 --> 03:56:40.480]  to come around with facebook alex told michael savage at the time he said they're going to come
[03:56:40.480 --> 03:56:45.760]  after you they're going to shut you down we saw that happened two days ago again on the day that the
[03:56:45.760 --> 03:56:50.240]  uh big debate was going to happen michael savage is talking about hillary clinton and what he believed
[03:56:50.240 --> 03:56:54.480]  to be her health issues he was immediately shut down by the new york station when he found out
[03:56:54.480 --> 03:57:00.320]  about that he talked about that on his other 399 stations and then they pulled the plug on all 399
[03:57:00.320 --> 03:57:05.840]  and started running an older show in a rebroadcast that's what we see happening over and over again
[03:57:05.840 --> 03:57:10.960]  now tonight we're going to talk more about this we're going to talk about the pope his attack on
[03:57:10.960 --> 03:57:15.920]  journalism saying that fear mongering and gossip is a form of terrorism so if you talk about the
[03:57:15.920 --> 03:57:21.460]  terrorists you are the terrorists they bring in the terrorists whether they're gonna bring in
[03:57:21.460 --> 03:57:25.200]  one percent or one tenth of a percent as uh michael savage was talking about are they gonna bring
[03:57:25.200 --> 03:57:30.640]  in uh 500 terrorist five thousand terrorists well we don't we don't know we don't know if it's one
[03:57:30.640 --> 03:57:35.280]  percent or one tenth of a percent or one hundredth of a percent but they're going to bring in the
[03:57:35.280 --> 03:57:39.520]  people and if you talk about it or you talk about the terrorist events according to the pope
[03:57:39.520 --> 03:57:44.160]  you are the terrorist. He says journalism based on gossip or rumors. What does that mean?
[03:57:44.160 --> 03:57:47.520]  That's what we always hear when they say conspiracy theorists. You're just a conspiracy
[03:57:47.520 --> 03:57:51.200]  theorist. You're just putting out rumors. You're just talking about gossip. No,
[03:57:51.920 --> 03:57:57.040]  we're talking about what is the official story and the gaps in the official story, the
[03:57:57.920 --> 03:58:02.800]  improbable official story. He says, when you do that, that is a form of terrorism. He says,
[03:58:02.800 --> 03:58:06.480]  you can kill a person with your tongue. It's even more true for journalists because their voice
[03:58:06.480 --> 03:58:10.720]  can reach everyone. This is a very powerful weapon. So join us tonight when the InfoWars
[03:58:10.720 --> 03:58:13.920]  Nightly News, we're going to talk about that. We're going to talk about the FBI director.
[03:58:13.920 --> 03:58:18.160]  I think they should start calling him the director of the FIB, the FIB, because that's
[03:58:18.160 --> 03:58:22.480]  what we're seeing as he covers for Hillary, many other subjects. And we have a special,
[03:58:22.480 --> 03:58:28.320]  we didn't talk about this. All shipping is free at infowarslife.com and all the InfoWars store
[03:58:28.320 --> 03:58:33.040]  products. That's the way we support you as you support our operation. Join us tonight,
