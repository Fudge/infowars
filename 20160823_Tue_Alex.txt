[00:00.000 --> 00:26.000]  I tell you, I am chomping at the bit more and more every day to get on air and start
[00:26.000 --> 00:32.480]  covering the incredible developments because as fast as I can go over all these fast moving
[00:32.480 --> 00:41.360]  stories that affect our world in such a big way, more is coming out really by the middle of second.
[00:45.360 --> 00:48.880]  WikiLeaks has released more documents showing that Hillary Clinton
[00:48.880 --> 00:58.160]  was looking at going on Parkinson's medication and another email
[01:03.680 --> 01:10.160]  has her saying, I quote, steel don't feel great and we've got more top scientists, more top
[01:10.160 --> 01:20.240]  neurologists going public saying Hillary clearly has serious neurological problems.
[01:20.240 --> 01:21.760]  The list is in the hundreds now.
[01:25.520 --> 01:32.480]  But that doesn't matter because she went on Jimmy Kimmel and when she went on Jimmy Kimmel,
[01:32.480 --> 01:43.840]  ladies and gentlemen, he took her pulse and then she opened a glass container
[01:47.040 --> 01:53.840]  of pickles. So now everything is okay. She has proven to the world
[01:55.040 --> 01:59.040]  she can basically do anything. And so I walked over to the cupboard this morning
[01:59.040 --> 02:05.840]  when I saw this clip on info wars.com and I got out a container of pickles and I thought,
[02:05.840 --> 02:09.840]  you know, pickles, the reason they're hard to open is they're vacuum sealed
[02:11.760 --> 02:18.640]  and you don't turn it like a regular top. It just pops and you're done. It doesn't go
[02:19.360 --> 02:28.160]  around but she goes around it. Oh, to open it. It's so hard like she's undoing a corkscrew or
[02:28.160 --> 02:34.320]  pulling a cork out of a wine bottle. And that's why I think Mark Dice shot a video last night
[02:34.320 --> 02:38.400]  pointing out that it's clearly fake and I totally agree with them, but they're faking Google numbers,
[02:38.400 --> 02:44.640]  they're faking polls, we've got stacks of news admitting that today. Why wouldn't they fake this?
[02:44.640 --> 02:50.800]  Remember, the architect of Obamacare Gruber working for Obama said, thank God the public doesn't
[02:50.800 --> 03:00.560]  pay attention. It's so stupid. So she strains as she turns around the pickles, no one opens
[03:00.560 --> 03:06.240]  pickles that way. In fact, let me just show you how you open pickles. Okay, you don't go,
[03:07.520 --> 03:13.120]  I got to go in a big circle or you've never opened pickles in 85 million years this way. Okay,
[03:13.120 --> 03:20.960]  you see that? Oh, then it opens. No, no, you open it in one quick pop. It's done for TV viewers.
[03:22.720 --> 03:29.680]  Reminds me of Caddyshack when the character that Chevy Chase is playing has the hot blonde over
[03:29.680 --> 03:34.800]  to his house and he doesn't have any fresh Perrier so he pours two bottles together that are by a
[03:34.800 --> 03:39.600]  pizza box. I'm going to play this later and puts a cap on top and walks over and goes, oh boy,
[03:39.600 --> 03:46.080]  it just came right off. But now we have to scientifically show how this is staged. And by
[03:46.080 --> 03:51.040]  the way, Jimmy Fallon a few months ago, they've gone totally political. They always have been,
[03:51.040 --> 03:56.240]  but now it's so, so open, so brazen, so naked, so obvious, so over the top, so in your face,
[03:57.760 --> 04:04.480]  so arrogant towards their prey, you the American people, that he's like, yeah, I hear TPP. I hear
[04:04.480 --> 04:09.680]  you support that. You down with TPP. They got this great jazz band playing, Obama's back, they're all
[04:09.680 --> 04:15.040]  cool. And he goes, yeah, you know me. It's like saying, you down with having a foreign corporate
[04:15.040 --> 04:20.080]  takeover America and shutting down even more jobs and screwing everybody. Just like you double black
[04:20.080 --> 04:27.920]  unemployment. Yeah, you know me. But see, it's okay because it's fun. It's cool. It's all completely
[04:27.920 --> 04:36.640]  scripted. It's like taking her pulse. But it's all entertainment, isn't it? So it's okay. 100%
[04:36.640 --> 04:42.800]  scripted. You don't open a can of pickles by going in a big circle around it and opening it.
[04:42.800 --> 04:49.120]  They won't open that way. That's why women famously can't open them because their daddy
[04:49.120 --> 04:54.640]  didn't teach them how to do it. A woman can open a can easy. You just go, boom, pop, boom, pop. You
[04:54.640 --> 05:03.280]  don't go, totally fake, caught red handed. Search engine users want to know why Hillary is dodging
[05:03.280 --> 05:09.280]  the press. Not one, but two of the five most popular search questions in the past day concern
[05:09.280 --> 05:14.640]  Hillary's apparent lack of press conferences. According to a tweet posted on Google Trends
[05:14.640 --> 05:19.680]  official Twitter account, the search trends correlate with responses from former New York
[05:19.680 --> 05:25.200]  City mayor Rudy Giuliani during a Fox News Sunday interview in which he pointed out how the Clinton
[05:25.200 --> 05:32.560]  media machine is working double time against Trump. Monday, August 22, marked the 262nd day
[05:32.560 --> 05:36.960]  without a presser for the Hillary team, according to the Washington Post. Meanwhile,
[05:36.960 --> 05:41.680]  on the other side of the ranch, Paul Jills of Watson has the article, Google hides Clinton
[05:41.680 --> 05:47.360]  body count search suggestions. Google has altered its search algorithm to prevent searches for
[05:47.360 --> 05:52.800]  Clinton body count from autocompleting, despite the term autocompleting when typed in virtually
[05:52.800 --> 05:58.000]  any other search engine. You can find more reports on infowars.com.
[06:00.000 --> 06:05.040]  Hi, yeah, first of all, I want to say, take the 12-act two, SuperMail, BrainForce,
[06:05.040 --> 06:10.080]  Prostigar, SilverBullet. I use them all. They're phenomenal. They work. Buy them, folks.

[08:13.520 --> 08:25.520]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[08:26.240 --> 08:33.120]  Hillary Clinton has been caught in more fraud, more corruption, more deception,
[08:33.840 --> 08:40.320]  more racketeering with her cohorts or willing accomplices. No, I don't mean the $35 million
[08:40.320 --> 08:45.280]  dollars Russia paid her foundation to give the Russian government one-fifth of the U.S.
[08:45.280 --> 08:50.080]  uranium stockpile. No, I'm not talking about her transferring when she was co-president in the
[08:50.080 --> 08:57.360]  mid-90s. The ICBM, Intercontinental Ballistic Missile Technology from top to bottom, from guidance
[08:57.360 --> 09:05.280]  to boost, to symmetry, to a reentry to MIRV. No, I'm not talking about her arming Al Qaeda and
[09:05.280 --> 09:09.920]  ISIS and turning them loose in the Middle East, but Saudi Arabia and being the founder of ISIS
[09:09.920 --> 09:14.400]  as Donald Trump properly has called her. General Flynn has also basically said that,
[09:14.400 --> 09:18.720]  the former head of defense intelligence. No, I'm not talking about her going after our
[09:18.720 --> 09:25.040]  Second Amendment or helping get derivatives legalized in the mid-1990s with the usual suspects,
[09:25.680 --> 09:32.160]  people like Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan, individuals like Larry Summers,
[09:32.160 --> 09:39.040]  and then signing us on to all that debt that wasn't ours. No, I'm talking about
[09:41.040 --> 09:48.000]  what happened last night when she went on one of these mindless late-night
[09:48.720 --> 09:53.760]  entertainment shows, Jimmy Kimmel, and said that it's a conspiracy theory that she has any health
[09:53.760 --> 10:00.080]  problems, and then she basically had her pulse taken by Jimmy Kimmel, and then she opened a
[10:00.080 --> 10:08.080]  container of pickles, but she didn't really open the container of pickles, because we're
[10:08.080 --> 10:12.320]  going to prove at the bottom of the hour, for TV viewers, we'll describe it for radio listeners,
[10:12.320 --> 10:19.120]  that that's not how you open a container of pickles. So I've got a whole bunch of containers
[10:19.120 --> 10:23.920]  of these in an earlier segment, already opened one and show people how you do it, but I'm going to
[10:23.920 --> 10:30.080]  show you the fraud blown up on video of her, and people say, well, why does this matter?
[10:31.200 --> 10:33.760]  This is the type of thing that can capture the public's attention.
[10:35.040 --> 10:39.360]  They're like, oh, uranium to Russia, oh, $100 million from Gulf States,
[10:40.000 --> 10:45.360]  you know, that execute gays and women for no reason. That's okay, but if she faked opening
[10:46.560 --> 10:50.960]  the glass container of pickles, folks, this is going to probably be a big deal for the general
[10:50.960 --> 10:57.040]  public, and I'm being serious, I'm not being facetious. But let's stop right there. We're
[10:57.040 --> 11:04.240]  going to have Roger Stone in studio today with us. Donald Trump is flying into Austin for a big rally
[11:05.280 --> 11:09.360]  in North Austin today. So who knows, we'll be popping in or who knows, we'll be interviewing
[11:09.360 --> 11:15.680]  tonight on top of Stone to be in studio. I think it's planes getting in as we speak,
[11:15.680 --> 11:21.440]  and a lot more today. But before I go any further,
[11:23.840 --> 11:26.400]  before I even get into all these other big stacks of news,
[11:29.520 --> 11:32.480]  before I detail the latest shahad operations,
[11:36.240 --> 11:41.440]  I want to start with this stack because this ties into everything.
[11:41.440 --> 11:49.360]  This is such an amazing stack. Reuters has a headline,
[11:51.760 --> 11:56.320]  and just this headline is an entire college course on deception.
[11:59.680 --> 12:10.000]  OSCE rights group request 500 international observers to monitor U.S. presidential vote,
[12:10.000 --> 12:15.360]  and then it goes on because they believe there's going to be fraud, but not by Hillary,
[12:17.600 --> 12:20.080]  but by Trump with no evidence of that.
[12:24.560 --> 12:28.560]  She's the one that just stole it from Bernie Sanders. He stopped the Republicans from stealing
[12:28.560 --> 12:38.960]  from him. Now, the real headline should be UN, EU directive, an organization to oversee U.S.
[12:38.960 --> 12:42.880]  elections. But see, they know that'll scare you and wake up people because we've been warning of
[12:42.880 --> 12:50.800]  this forever. So they just say, OSCE, that right there is the tactic. Then you read the Reuters
[12:50.800 --> 12:58.080]  article, the organization for security and cooperation in Europe. That's the original
[12:58.080 --> 13:04.000]  group set up in the Marshall plan that the UN was set up through. So this is the predecessor of that
[13:04.000 --> 13:11.760]  to send 500 international observers to observe November U.S. presidential election, a 10-fold
[13:11.760 --> 13:18.080]  increase from the number the group deployed in 2012. They knew Romney take a dive, and then it goes on
[13:18.080 --> 13:24.480]  with what they say. Now, I thought Donald Trump's a total cook for saying there's a lot of evidence
[13:24.480 --> 13:29.760]  of election fraud. We need to investigate it and watch it. But now the Justice Department is the
[13:29.760 --> 13:36.080]  group giving them the federal authority to do this. And they announced last week, Jay Johnson,
[13:36.080 --> 13:42.560]  that he's going to put five-fold the federal observers to make sure he legals and others
[13:42.560 --> 13:48.080]  can vote. That's really what's happening. So they're coming in to make sure voter fraud can
[13:48.080 --> 14:00.960]  take place. The Democrats specialty. Isn't that just darling? So contradictions within contradictions,
[14:00.960 --> 14:09.200]  the UN, EU, organization of economic cooperative development that has this security treaty
[14:10.720 --> 14:16.720]  set up, security cooperation in Europe. I mean, almost no one knows who all these groups and
[14:16.720 --> 14:21.680]  organizations are. I do. I've studied the globalist. So this is actually the original
[14:21.680 --> 14:28.320]  globalist organization that took over Europe after World War II to oversee our elections.
[14:28.320 --> 14:32.960]  This is beyond the UN. This is the group the Rockefellers and Rothschild set up,
[14:32.960 --> 14:40.560]  and then they set up the UN after that. Global government. Now, let's continue.
[14:40.560 --> 14:46.400]  For two weeks, almost three weeks, we've been harping on the fact that there is no coverage
[14:47.680 --> 14:55.200]  in U.S. mainstream, dinosaur, decepticon, enemy, collaborator, media, or what was it called,
[14:55.200 --> 14:59.680]  discredited corporate media, 6% trust rate according to the Associated Press and their
[14:59.680 --> 15:05.200]  own international study or national study. But strangely enough, in Europe, it's gotten coverage
[15:05.200 --> 15:12.880]  in the German news and the French news and the Russian news, the Italian news, and now the Jerusalem
[15:12.880 --> 15:18.880]  Post gets it completely right when it says this. What have I been harping on day after day? Our
[15:18.880 --> 15:28.560]  world, Jerusalem Post, Soros campaign of global chaos. The first thing we see is the megalomaniacal
[15:28.560 --> 15:34.320]  nature of Soros' philanthropic project. No corner of the globe is unaffected by his efforts,
[15:34.320 --> 15:40.080]  no policy area is left untouched. And then it goes through the emails,
[15:40.880 --> 15:46.480]  how to overthrow the U.S., how to overthrow Israel, how to overthrow Europe. This is so,
[15:46.480 --> 15:52.000]  and we have him, diabolical. And some people, because they've been conditioned by the press,
[15:52.720 --> 15:54.880]  will say, oh my gosh, Israel's bad, let's get Israel.
[15:59.440 --> 16:03.040]  Israel's a complex situation and Israel's done some bad things just like the U.S.S.,
[16:03.040 --> 16:09.520]  but I'll tell you, I'll take Israel over George Soros any day, sweetheart. Israel's a diverse
[16:09.520 --> 16:18.480]  group. Soros is a Nazi collaborator, literal demon. But the point is, forget Israel. Forget the U.S.
[16:18.480 --> 16:26.960]  for George Soros' emails are public for almost, what is it, 16 days, thousands of them,
[16:27.920 --> 16:31.360]  how they're bringing in the Muslims to overthrow things, how they're destabilizing,
[16:31.360 --> 16:35.920]  it's all there, arrest him. And even the Jerusalem Post comes out,
[16:36.960 --> 16:39.840]  if I have time later in the third hour, I'm going to read this whole article,
[16:39.840 --> 16:41.440]  but I've got hundreds, so I've got to move.
[16:43.840 --> 16:50.720]  You in to run our elections with just department power and under strong cities,
[16:50.720 --> 16:55.200]  I'm getting chills, to oversee our police departments. That's Loretta Lynch saying that,
[16:55.200 --> 17:01.920]  not me, we are so, so, so conquered. But if we admit we've been taken over,
[17:01.920 --> 17:07.360]  it will implode, it's illegitimate. What do they call the North American Union documents in 2008
[17:07.360 --> 17:12.080]  from BAM Canada when judicial watch soon and got them? What do they call it?
[17:14.160 --> 17:20.560]  They called it North American integration and global governance by stealth. What does stealth
[17:20.560 --> 17:30.720]  need to be stealth? If it's not stealth, it crashes and burns. Oh, we're going to beat these people.
[17:33.040 --> 17:37.120]  And by the way, it's not the Russians hacking Soros. I can tell you that I've confirmed from
[17:37.120 --> 17:42.560]  high level sources that it's US agencies. Absolutely, wake up, save the country,
[17:42.560 --> 17:47.040]  we can defeat these people bloodlessly by exposing their crimes. Let's keep hitting them and hitting
[17:47.040 --> 17:51.200]  them hard. I salute the folks inside the government doing this. Hit them and hit them hard. Hit all
[17:51.200 --> 17:55.360]  of them. But notice the whole world's hitting Soros. Everybody knows who the enemy is.
[17:57.280 --> 18:04.240]  Worldwide concern over too many immigrants study shows, Yahoo News. But that's okay.
[18:04.240 --> 18:08.080]  Paris Tourism Chief Demands Rescue Plan has attacked scare off visitors
[18:09.680 --> 18:12.000]  and they basically lost half their tourism last year.
[18:12.000 --> 18:18.880]  But don't worry, Daily Mail has the quote and there's a video, but it's in Palais-vous-Français.
[18:19.600 --> 18:25.360]  Borders are the worst invention ever, close quote. EU Chief Jean-Claude Junker.
[18:26.560 --> 18:33.920]  Look at the Junker family, folks. Widen's rift with European leaders as he calls for open borders.
[18:33.920 --> 18:41.840]  That's like saying doors on your house are the worst invention ever. Or
[18:41.840 --> 18:47.440]  privacy is the worst invention ever. Or having a safe is the worst invention ever.
[18:47.440 --> 18:51.840]  If we didn't have borders, Genghis Khan would rule the world today. Or is a Zoff Springwood
[18:51.840 --> 18:56.160]  or Hitler. I mean, what are they talking about? A bad guy takes over one country,
[18:56.160 --> 19:00.000]  other countries can organize against it. But under a global government, you can't do that,
[19:00.000 --> 19:06.240]  you're under one system. So the people are like, we're panicking, they're murdering us.
[19:06.240 --> 19:08.880]  Five million of portans, they're killing people, they're burning vehicles,
[19:08.880 --> 19:11.600]  they're robbing, they're raping. And he's just like, we're getting rid of it.

[19:33.840 --> 19:38.560]  news, massive censorship in Europe against anybody criticizing this, this is how they're
[19:38.560 --> 19:44.400]  conquering the planet. And the head of the UN Borders and Migrants Council is actually the
[19:44.400 --> 19:51.040]  founder of the EU. And he is openly admitting it is to bring down the West. And then we've got the
[19:51.040 --> 19:56.320]  clip we played yesterday of Vice President Biden saying yes, white people are bad, we've got to
[19:56.320 --> 20:03.040]  get rid of them. I mean, this is crazy. We use mobile devices right against our bodies every day.
[20:03.040 --> 20:07.040]  But growing scientific evidence has emerged showing serious health risks associated with

[24:20.720 --> 24:41.040]  Yep, when I was just a baby. Always clean your guns. Yeah, my mama didn't tell me don't
[24:41.040 --> 24:46.640]  play with guns. She told me always clean your guns and don't point a gun at something unless you're
[24:46.640 --> 24:56.080]  planning to pull a trigger. All right, that's Johnny Cash bringing us in. Donald Trump's going
[24:56.080 --> 25:02.640]  to be speaking tonight, seven o'clock at the Travis County Expo Center in North Austin.
[25:03.440 --> 25:09.360]  The venue holds, I think, about 20,000 people and we're going to have our crew inside. We're
[25:09.360 --> 25:13.360]  going to have our crew outside. The communists are going to be up there. I'm told the same ones
[25:13.360 --> 25:18.560]  that came out and tried to physically attack us. It was like retarded zombies, you know,
[25:18.560 --> 25:23.280]  you see in movies. They weren't very effective. So we're all going to be out there this evening
[25:24.320 --> 25:27.600]  and if Trump didn't on the show today, he'll be on the show Friday, but I'm just going to leave
[25:27.600 --> 25:33.600]  it at that. Roger Stone's plane is delayed, just took off from Dallas where he was flying in from
[25:33.600 --> 25:39.520]  Florida and so he should be here by the middle of the broadcast in about an hour for the balance of
[25:39.520 --> 25:47.040]  the transmission today. Okay, where to start? Where to begin getting into all of this news
[25:47.040 --> 25:52.960]  that I haven't covered yet, which is the majority of it. You have to understand when I just covered
[25:52.960 --> 26:03.360]  Reuters with the corporation and organization that founded the UN saying it's going to oversee
[26:03.360 --> 26:14.960]  our elections. That is so huge and they're doing it at 10 fold what they did in 2012. So see, this
[26:14.960 --> 26:20.160]  is an escalation and I can play the clips of Loretta Lynch in the press conference six months
[26:20.160 --> 26:25.840]  ago saying under strong cities, we will follow the UN UNESCO treaties, which we haven't ratified
[26:25.840 --> 26:33.920]  on policing, on small arms, all of it and they will tell the review boards and recommend to the
[26:33.920 --> 26:39.200]  Justice Department what to do in your town. She said the UN will give us our orders. Remember
[26:39.200 --> 26:44.400]  Obama a few years ago in Syria? He said, I'm going to act alone outside of Congress. I have the
[26:44.400 --> 26:53.040]  authority of the United Nations, even though he didn't have the authority. Then he said, well now
[26:53.040 --> 26:56.880]  because the UN wouldn't even go along with it because Russia vetoed it. He went further and he
[26:56.880 --> 27:05.520]  said, okay, I have the authority of NATO. That is a consortium of North Atlantic countries,
[27:06.560 --> 27:12.960]  the US comprising half its force and funding. This is open world government people
[27:14.400 --> 27:19.520]  where our politicians get bought off. They sign us over to the TPP, the UN, the World Trade
[27:19.520 --> 27:25.920]  Organization, the IMF, the World Bank all run by the same hundred or so people. You look at who
[27:25.920 --> 27:30.960]  runs the CFR, who runs the IMF, who runs the World Bank, who runs the International Bank of
[27:30.960 --> 27:39.920]  Settlements, who runs the OECD, who runs the OSCE. It's a hundred people or less.
[27:42.080 --> 27:45.920]  And of course, who is one of the masters that would always organize all those people, Henry
[27:45.920 --> 27:50.480]  Kissinger. That's why Hillary Clinton's gotten up in speeches and that's why General Jones,
[27:51.120 --> 27:56.240]  former chairman of the Joint Chiefs and then former National Security Council head,
[27:57.280 --> 28:02.960]  have gone on TV and in print journals and said, I get my orders from Henry Kissinger and the
[28:02.960 --> 28:13.440]  Council on Foreign Relations every day. Those are quotes by both of them. To rub your nose in it.
[28:13.440 --> 28:20.000]  Remember when Obama violated Article 1, Section 9 of the Constitution and worked at the United
[28:20.000 --> 28:29.360]  Nations as the Secretary General for a time? And then when he sat in and chaired the Security Council
[28:32.880 --> 28:39.920]  for one rotation, less than a year, but it was almost a year, he'd go into all the details of it.
[28:39.920 --> 28:48.160]  This is open world government in your face. They are practicing it. They are exercising it.
[28:48.160 --> 28:52.720]  They are engaging in it in front of you. And again, it's not like they're bringing in some
[28:52.720 --> 28:58.480]  Star Trek, Lovey Dovey UN World Government thing, kumbaya. It's to carry out deindustrialization.
[28:58.480 --> 29:03.520]  It's to carry out austerity. It's to carry out the eugenics end game. World governments a means to
[29:03.520 --> 29:08.960]  an end. Now I'm going to stop there. Coming up because it's illustrative of their fraud, we're
[29:08.960 --> 29:16.160]  going to prove that Hillary Clinton didn't really open that container of pickles on Jimmy Kimmel.
[29:16.160 --> 29:20.240]  And then we're going to show some of the other political sites that late night TV is involved
[29:20.240 --> 29:26.240]  in for this crime cartel. Then I'm going to get into forced inoculations in the United States,
[29:26.240 --> 29:30.800]  now official. We're going to get into the fact we're not letting any Christian refugees into the
[29:30.800 --> 29:35.680]  U.S. We're going to the latest on Hillary's health that ties into all this. We're going to get into
[29:35.680 --> 29:40.960]  the latest on the Clinton Foundation, the economy and a lot more. I'm Alex Jones. This is a very
[29:40.960 --> 29:46.320]  important broadcast. Everybody can listen in full wars.com forward slash show or see the video feed
[29:46.320 --> 29:54.080]  or on stations across the country. We're on the March, the empires on the run. Alex Jones and the
[29:54.080 --> 30:04.400]  GCN radio network. In an unbelievable exchange with reporters, State Department spokesman
[30:04.400 --> 30:10.720]  Mark Toner admitted that he has no idea who picked up the $400 million in cash that was
[30:10.720 --> 30:16.240]  put on a plane to Iran. Toner claimed that the Obama administration knows where the money went.
[30:16.240 --> 30:20.960]  Do you know who picked up the money? Asked Associated Press reporter Bradley Clapper.
[30:20.960 --> 30:27.360]  I don't reply Toner. Who'd you pay? Clapper asked. I believe it was Iranian officials and Iranian
[30:27.360 --> 30:32.080]  government officials, but I don't know particularly who individually it was. Toner said,
[30:32.080 --> 30:35.920]  Do you know which part of the Iranian government you paid? Clapper asked.
[30:35.920 --> 30:41.200]  I don't have that information. No, Toner said. Does the administration know who paid it? Clapper
[30:41.200 --> 30:46.720]  asked. I'm certain they would say yes. Toner answered. And this isn't the first time the Obama
[30:46.720 --> 30:51.600]  administration has acted on the honor system. Previously, they had accidentally dropped a
[30:51.600 --> 30:58.560]  crate of explosives that was picked up by ISIS overseas. You can find more reports on info wars.com.
[30:58.560 --> 31:04.000]  Not a group you developed living defense for us. It took you over a year to do it. Why is this so
[31:04.000 --> 31:09.760]  good? Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[31:09.760 --> 31:15.040]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system,
[31:15.040 --> 31:21.520]  but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body
[31:21.520 --> 31:27.440]  that lives off a host mechanism right now with all the refugees spreading disease around. We have
[31:27.440 --> 31:32.080]  biological warfare going on everywhere. These are all parasites. Tell us about all this episode.
[31:32.080 --> 31:36.000]  There's so many things that are in it. You have the neem in there. You have the organic clove
[31:36.000 --> 31:41.360]  bud, the organic wormwood. I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year. All right,
[31:41.360 --> 31:44.880]  well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today. It just came back in
[31:44.880 --> 31:49.280]  yesterday. Living Defense, infowarslife.com. And folks, you can't lose full of stuff that's great
[31:49.280 --> 31:54.880]  for your body, period. And you support the broadcast, infowarslife.com. Thank you, Dr.
[31:54.880 --> 31:58.480]  Group, from the Global Healing Center. Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[31:59.840 --> 32:05.680]  Brainforce, it's completely different. Try a bottle of it. Rob Doe joins us. You worked,
[32:05.680 --> 32:10.400]  I guess, like 20 plus hours. Tell us what Brainforce did. I'd been working all day. I took a couple
[32:10.400 --> 32:16.240]  hours off coaching basketball. I get in here at 8.30. I was kind of run down. You know, I just
[32:16.240 --> 32:19.840]  didn't feel like I was going to make it. And I really wanted to do a good job on the interview.
[32:19.840 --> 32:23.760]  I got my bottle of Brainforce right there. I popped two of them. And about 20 minutes later,
[32:23.760 --> 32:29.440]  it's like, everything just kind of clears up. It's got four and a half stars. People really love it.
[32:29.440 --> 32:33.920]  Read about it. Find out why third-party pharmaceutical sites give it such high praise,
[32:33.920 --> 32:39.600]  because it really does have the best organic-based systems that will blow your socks off. I haven't
[32:39.600 --> 32:43.360]  pulled an all-nighter like that in a while, but I probably could not have done it without Brainforce.
[32:43.360 --> 32:48.720]  I went home about 6.45 this morning, took three hours of sleep, got up, took two more Brainforce,
[32:48.720 --> 32:54.880]  and came in. You will find Brainforce and other game-changing products at InfowarsLife.com,

[32:58.320 --> 33:15.920]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[33:28.560 --> 33:39.280]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live. Thank you so much for joining us. Roger
[33:39.280 --> 33:43.520]  Jones will be in studio later. We're going to have live coverage tonight, starting at 7 o'clock
[33:43.520 --> 33:48.480]  central and going for hours of Trump coming to Austin, Texas. And we'll have the communist
[33:48.480 --> 33:54.080]  outside whenever they're up to. We'll also have crew inside. And of course, some surprises as well
[33:54.080 --> 34:02.960]  coming up this evening, 7 o'clock central. Many of our radio affiliates now pick up the TV show.
[34:02.960 --> 34:09.680]  I never thought of that. I was doing a TV show to get on television, and I do a radio show that's
[34:09.680 --> 34:14.560]  slash TV for the internet that's three hours long and live, well, not four hours that you're
[34:14.560 --> 34:21.200]  watching and listening to right now. But then I started doing the Nightly News a few years ago,
[34:21.200 --> 34:26.240]  four years ago, and stations started calling us saying, hey, that's really good radio too.
[34:26.240 --> 34:34.000]  We want to pick that up. So I know that more than 50 of our affiliates actually are picking up
[34:35.600 --> 34:40.400]  the hour-long Nightly News. So really exciting. And a lot of them take our live coverage of debates.
[34:40.960 --> 34:47.840]  They take our election coverage. It's really crazy. I'm telling you, if we went 20 hours a day live,
[34:47.840 --> 34:51.600]  it would change the world. The problem is, I don't have the capital, the crew yet,
[34:52.240 --> 34:55.760]  but more and more I am thinking about doing something like that just because there's so
[34:55.760 --> 35:02.240]  much news, so much analysis, so much happening. I can get a crew of maybe, I don't know, 10 more crew
[35:02.240 --> 35:08.240]  members and 10 more on air host and just have each person do an hour or so a day of live analysis
[35:08.240 --> 35:13.360]  and just coverage that's teleprompter free. And it would get picked up everywhere. And I think
[35:13.360 --> 35:22.720]  that's really where we should just go. We're obviously going to get into
[35:24.640 --> 35:30.320]  the latest on the economy, the latest on medical tyranny here in the United States as the system
[35:30.320 --> 35:41.520]  moves for forced inoculations. The administration saying that for every thousand Muslims they bring
[35:41.520 --> 35:46.720]  in as refugees, they might bring in a couple Christians. That trend is continuing as well.
[35:49.680 --> 35:57.200]  But the first thing I want to do is debunk Hillary Clinton on her claim that it's a conspiracy
[35:57.200 --> 36:04.320]  theory and that it's illegitimate to come out and question her health. The Democratic Party
[36:04.320 --> 36:10.320]  made a really big deal out of John McCain's health in 2008. And quite frankly, I think that that was
[36:10.320 --> 36:14.480]  probably legitimate. John McCain has some serious health problems and was hiding them.
[36:16.720 --> 36:22.480]  But just like they had some legitimate criticisms of Bush's lackluster response to Katrina,
[36:22.480 --> 36:29.760]  when Obama didn't even show up for six days and Hillary never showed up, that's a big deal,
[36:30.480 --> 36:35.920]  especially when they're criticizing Donald Trump. So there's a double standard. And I'm about to prove
[36:35.920 --> 36:43.840]  that she didn't open that container of pickles on Jimmy Kimmel Live last night. But first,
[36:45.200 --> 36:50.160]  let's go to Google's own admissions. The stories on infowars.com. Just to illustrate the fraud
[36:50.160 --> 36:58.000]  that happens on a daily basis. Google hides Clinton body count, search suggestions. They admit
[36:58.000 --> 37:13.680]  it. They've done things like delist Trump during key parts of the election cycle as a
[37:13.680 --> 37:22.080]  presidential candidate, period. It goes on and on and on. So that's the latest article today.
[37:22.080 --> 37:28.320]  Don't want people to investigate the deaths, the mysterious deaths of the Democrats have
[37:28.320 --> 37:32.640]  hired a big PR agent to deal with this. And they're interfacing with Google. Another report.
[37:33.840 --> 37:38.720]  Trump defeats Hillary in a poll. Monmouth amends it to give Hillary the victory. Oh,
[37:38.720 --> 37:44.240]  they said, oh, well, that can't be right. Let's go back and fix this poll weighed 29 Republicans
[37:44.240 --> 37:48.160]  to 33 Democrats to let Hillary win. Now, let's give it to Monmouth.
[37:48.160 --> 37:56.560]  They didn't have 15% more Democrats than Republicans like Reuters and others have done,
[37:56.560 --> 38:02.800]  but simply astounding. Now, since you saw those two little pieces of fraud, don't forget that we've
[38:02.800 --> 38:09.360]  seen Jimmy Fallon come out and push the Trans Pacific partnership as if it's trendy and cool
[38:09.360 --> 38:15.760]  with Obama. They're trying to use entertainment to push things that wouldn't be palatable in a real
[38:15.760 --> 38:25.200]  news format of even half educated or informed people. So last night, we got treated to her going
[38:25.760 --> 38:31.440]  on the program. And we're going to play the full clip during a moment and
[38:33.360 --> 38:38.560]  Jimmy Kimmel reaches over and takes her pulse and then makes a joke about it. And she talks about
[38:38.560 --> 38:43.280]  the wacky kooky way she's being attacked. She doesn't have any health issues, hoping that
[38:43.280 --> 38:52.800]  the audience isn't aware of the fact that they've had dozens and dozens of top brain surgeons,
[38:52.800 --> 38:58.080]  neurologists, you name it, some of which are even Democrats, go on TV and say she shows signs of
[38:58.080 --> 39:03.520]  neurological impairment. They don't talk about the fact that the new WikiLeaks email has come out
[39:03.520 --> 39:10.400]  with Hillary looking to take Parkinson's medication and talking about how she couldn't get out of bed.
[39:10.400 --> 39:13.040]  This is in her emails.
[39:19.360 --> 39:27.600]  So they are engaged in a cover up. We know that back in 2012, 2013, she spent basically a year
[39:29.760 --> 39:34.560]  in a hospital that specializes in brain surgery and brain tumors and neurological problems. And
[39:34.560 --> 39:39.200]  they admit she had surgeries for blood clots, but she's not released those medical records.
[39:39.200 --> 39:47.760]  Now, that said, all of that laid out here and doctors coming out every day and new videos of
[39:47.760 --> 39:52.480]  her stumbling and falling down and not being able to stand up and acting disoriented and looking
[39:52.480 --> 39:58.480]  like she's having many seizures. And our secret service leaked intel that she indeed has some
[39:58.480 --> 40:02.640]  serious neurological disorders, had to have her vehicles fitted with special
[40:02.640 --> 40:08.480]  systems that lower down to the ground so she can be basically lifted into the car.
[40:10.080 --> 40:11.280]  Despite all of that,
[40:14.400 --> 40:19.520]  they put her on an entertainment show like Jimmy Kimmel and he takes her pulse and then
[40:20.080 --> 40:31.040]  he opens or she supposedly opens a can of pickles. Now, I noticed this right away and
[40:31.040 --> 40:37.680]  we blew the video up. There's no pop when she opens it and she acts like she has to turn it
[40:37.680 --> 40:46.960]  all the way around like she's opening a can of peanut butter. But anyone who's opened a sealed can
[40:48.400 --> 40:53.680]  of pickled vegetables, whether it be tomatoes, whether it be garlic, whether it be olives,
[40:53.680 --> 41:01.520]  whether it be pickled fruit, knows there is a pop. You don't turn around it. You can't open a can
[41:01.520 --> 41:07.360]  of pickles that way. You pressure down and pop it open and then unscrew it. There's no pop. She
[41:07.360 --> 41:14.640]  acts like it pops at the end. This is completely and totally fake and scripted in all part of
[41:14.640 --> 41:18.320]  entertainment. So let's play the unedited clip to analyze it.
[41:18.320 --> 41:25.200]  There are rumors that have gotten started. The new one is that you're unhealthy, that you had a
[41:25.200 --> 41:31.680]  concussion. Rudy Giuliani was on Fox News yesterday and today and he's saying you look, you seem to
[41:31.680 --> 41:39.440]  be sick, you look tired, et cetera, et cetera. Are you in good health? Well, this has become
[41:39.440 --> 41:47.200]  one of their themes. Here, you take my pulse while I'm talking to you. So make sure I'm alive.
[41:47.200 --> 41:53.520]  Oh my God, there's nothing there. There's nothing there. Back in October, the National
[41:53.520 --> 41:58.800]  Enquirer said I would be dead in six months. Oh, wow. So with every breath I take, I feel like
[41:58.800 --> 42:05.680]  it's a new lease on life. A new lease on life. I don't know why they are saying this. I think,
[42:06.240 --> 42:12.400]  on the one hand, it's part of the wacky strategy. Just say all these crazy things and maybe you
[42:12.400 --> 42:18.080]  can get some people to believe you. On the other hand, it just absolutely makes no sense. And I
[42:18.080 --> 42:23.920]  don't go around questioning Donald Trump's health. I mean, as far as I can tell, he's as healthy as
[42:23.920 --> 42:28.880]  a horse. Well, his doctor said he had the best health medical examination he's ever seen in a human
[42:28.880 --> 42:48.320]  being. Can you open this jar of pickles? This is totally fake. And notice she's wearing a lav mic.
[42:48.960 --> 42:56.560]  You would hear the pop of the can. Now, before I demonstrate this for folks, let's
[42:56.560 --> 43:06.160]  and I'll describe this for radio listeners. Let's do it in slow mo. Let's go ahead and show this in
[43:06.160 --> 43:11.200]  slow motion. No, no, first let's show it blown up. And then we'll show it in slow motion. Here it is.
[43:11.200 --> 43:29.200]  And then she just lifts it off the top. That's not how you open a can of pickles.
[43:30.080 --> 43:37.920]  Now, we did some humor here. This reminded me of when the Ty Webb character in Caddyshack 1980
[43:37.920 --> 43:44.240]  classic has, you know, the hot blonde over at his house and he's got a half eaten pizza out
[43:44.240 --> 43:48.800]  and two Perrier's he pours them together and tries to put the cap back on. I've actually done that
[43:48.800 --> 43:55.200]  myself years ago. I was just kind of reenacting it as in college, but it actually did do it
[43:55.200 --> 44:00.480]  and comes over and acts like he's opening it and it's just it's just as fake as when Hillary does it.
[44:00.480 --> 44:08.800]  Here it is.
[44:16.400 --> 44:18.400]  Okay, now we've got it blown up one more time.
[44:19.680 --> 44:27.520]  Seriously, you're watching this. This is not how you open a can. Okay. And I've got four different
[44:27.520 --> 44:31.360]  containers here. I've already opened one earlier as a test just to make sure my memory was serving
[44:31.360 --> 44:36.000]  me correct. I probably opened 300 of these in my life or more. Okay. And I've got different brands
[44:36.000 --> 44:40.160]  here. It's all the same. You pop them open. You pop them open. It's why your hands are greasy.
[44:40.160 --> 44:46.560]  It's hard to do or sweaty. You pop them. You don't turn them like it's peanut butter or jelly or
[44:46.560 --> 44:51.680]  something or like you're opening up, you know, a can of fertilizer or whatever. It's popped. It's
[44:51.680 --> 44:59.280]  vacuum sealed. It's vacuum sealed. Okay. Boom. See that pop. Now, I'm dripping all over the
[44:59.920 --> 45:05.280]  mouse pad here. Excuse me. Don't try this at home, ladies and gentlemen. Now continuing. Here is a
[45:05.280 --> 45:13.440]  larger container of plastic. And again, now my hands are wet. Just what I was talking about.
[45:14.320 --> 45:19.680]  This is not product placement. Again, you will notice you don't open it going like this and then
[45:19.680 --> 45:25.120]  it pops off. You open it by pressuring down and popping. Look at that. I can't even get it open.
[45:25.120 --> 45:31.680]  My hands are wet. See, that's how strong I am. But Hillary Clinton, that's God. Look at that.
[45:31.680 --> 45:36.240]  I am so weak. Also hurt my hand last week. I am so weak. I can't even open this. This is real. This
[45:36.240 --> 45:41.440]  is really happening. Where's Hillary Clinton when you're here? I mean, I don't want to look like
[45:41.440 --> 45:44.640]  I'm not manly here. Sometimes you got to bang this up at the table. I guess we got one that was
[45:44.640 --> 45:50.960]  really tough. I can't. This might happen one out of 50. I can't even open this. But Hillary Clinton
[45:50.960 --> 45:58.640]  can't. I mean, this is the level of bull we're dealing with here. Okay. See it. There we go.
[45:58.640 --> 46:02.960]  So you have to pop it, ladies and gentlemen. You have to pop it. My hands are wet. Really
[46:02.960 --> 46:08.560]  on there, though. Let's try this one. Smaller plastic. Now the whole office can enjoy some
[46:08.560 --> 46:16.000]  pickles today. Anyway, almost broke my hand a few weeks ago. Remember the whole trading
[46:16.000 --> 46:20.080]  punches with Weldon Henson, which I will not be doing again. I am not 20 years old anymore.
[46:23.600 --> 46:28.000]  I'm going to show you again. In fact, can we zoom in on this to show people what Hillary did?
[46:28.000 --> 46:32.400]  She claims she went around and then it just comes right off like that. But she does this whole fake
[46:32.400 --> 46:39.680]  like she's training effect. Let me copy Hillary Clinton real quick. Give me a wide shot.
[46:42.800 --> 46:49.440]  I'm making a Bernie Sanders sound going in a big circle. Then it comes off. They don't come off like
[46:52.000 --> 46:57.360]  like that. They come off like pressure. Just open it. That's how they come off.
[46:57.360 --> 47:02.800]  Dripping more of this now. Since when do you open these? They drip everywhere. I guess these are
[47:02.800 --> 47:08.720]  filled with the brim. So there you go. I worked up a sweat there. And we can now take that video,
[47:08.720 --> 47:13.200]  edit it down for brevity, and put it out for folks, but leave the part I couldn't open it.
[47:14.320 --> 47:19.680]  This is just classic. This is so ridiculous. One more time with the caddy shot clip as well,
[47:19.680 --> 47:26.320]  because I mean, you can't watch it only once. Let's show Hillary with the staged opening of the
[47:26.320 --> 47:28.800]  can of Pickles. Here it is.
[47:42.320 --> 47:46.080]  Oh, by the way, I was going to illustrate that too. We have a can opener.
[47:47.600 --> 47:50.480]  Look, all you have to be to be president now is to be able to open
[47:50.480 --> 47:58.960]  a container of water or be able to open a container of Pickles.
[47:59.600 --> 48:02.400]  So basically, this is what it looks like when you really open up
[48:04.000 --> 48:10.400]  a bottle of water that's carbonated. Now, I just did that. That's what it looks like.
[48:10.400 --> 48:17.040]  Now, when it's fake, I would put this back on just like that. I'm Ty Webb from CaddyShack.
[48:17.040 --> 48:21.200]  Re-enacting CaddyShack is key. And then I'm trying to act cool to the hot blonde. I'm like,
[48:21.920 --> 48:26.320]  oh, baby, I got you a little fresh drink here. Oh, whoa, whoa. Oh my gosh, I can't re-enact that.
[48:26.320 --> 48:30.640]  I put it back on. I'm better than Ty. Oh, look at that. Here, I'll have to re-enact it with this one.
[48:32.640 --> 48:36.800]  This is live teleprompter free, ladies and gentlemen. This is not fake. Okay.
[48:36.800 --> 48:41.520]  You know, we're actually trying to illustrate how it's fake and it's even hard to do. Okay.
[48:41.520 --> 48:47.520]  Let me do a job here. Let me just, here you go. Hello, my darling. How are you doing?
[48:47.520 --> 48:56.080]  Is it like a fresh drink? Oh, whoa, whoa. There you go. So I guarantee our ratings are skyrocketing
[48:56.080 --> 49:06.400]  right now. You know, just do the right thing though. Can we please play the entire unedited
[49:06.400 --> 49:13.680]  CaddyShack clip when he's in there? We don't have it. Now, like in Saudi Arabia, there are
[49:13.680 --> 49:17.840]  arresting people that disagree with the government calling it sorcery and it's a death penalty,
[49:17.840 --> 49:20.560]  which I don't normally agree with, but I don't think if you don't, if you don't have
[49:20.560 --> 49:25.600]  the full CaddyShack clip ready, that is the death penalty. We do have it. Okay. Then you're reprieved.
[49:25.600 --> 49:37.600]  Here it is. Well, oh, surprise, surprise, surprise. Oh, go ahead. That's nothing.
[49:37.600 --> 49:41.840]  I tried calling, but they don't have a listing for Mr. Wonderful. What spelling did you use?
[49:42.720 --> 49:48.000]  Sorry about this mess. Let me just clean up here. Getting ready for the season.
[49:48.000 --> 49:56.400]  What, Doug? No, no. Dolphin. Do you like the drink? Tuna colada? Perhaps. Anything, any. Who's your
[49:56.400 --> 50:01.440]  decorator? Benny Hanna? No, I bought most of that stuff back when he was in Vietnam.
[50:02.160 --> 50:11.600]  You were in the war? Oh, no. Homo. Much better now, though.
[50:11.600 --> 50:18.400]  Here's an uncaged check for $70,000.
[50:19.680 --> 50:24.400]  Keep it. There's a bunch of them. And the summons.
[50:26.000 --> 50:29.360]  Yours. Pretty pathetic, Ty.
[50:30.720 --> 50:37.360]  Pathetic? Maybe you, Lacey. For me, there's a subtle perfection in everything I do.
[50:37.360 --> 50:41.920]  I may have a standard. It's my own way. My uncle says you got a screw loose.
[50:42.800 --> 50:53.200]  Your uncle, Melissa Collies. You're rather attractive for a beautiful girl with a great body.
[50:59.120 --> 51:05.200]  That's Hillary. Oh, that's enough. Hillary is so incredibly powerful
[51:05.200 --> 51:10.320]  that she probably can just look at a can of Perrier. We went to the grocery store this morning.
[51:10.320 --> 51:13.440]  They didn't have it for some reason. As it was sold out, so we got top of Chico.
[51:14.480 --> 51:17.360]  Hope their check cash is no. I'm serious. This is not product placement.
[51:17.920 --> 51:22.800]  And it just illustrates, we have all this incredibly serious news going on. We have Hillary
[51:22.800 --> 51:30.880]  caught in all these frauds, the missile secrets to China, 17, 18 years ago, the uranium deals,
[51:30.880 --> 51:35.840]  five years ago to Russia that nobody else could deal, you know, could get for 35 million,
[51:36.400 --> 51:40.720]  all the corruption, all the lies, the emails, the administration she was part of,
[51:41.600 --> 51:48.560]  persecuting all these innocent people. But it's okay because they go on these TV shows
[51:48.560 --> 51:53.680]  and act popular and cool and funny and make jokes about people that question known liars.
[51:53.680 --> 51:58.400]  Oh, and we're going to edit that whole train wreck that you just saw or heard 10 minutes ago
[51:58.400 --> 52:02.480]  together into a shorter piece to illustrate how we caught her line, how there's no pop
[52:02.480 --> 52:10.160]  when you open up the container of pickles. And just add this little point on to that.
[52:11.200 --> 52:16.160]  We should play, just as we mentioned it, the down with TPP clip because that really makes
[52:16.160 --> 52:21.520]  me sicker than this. Here's the TPP handing over our national sovereignty to shadowy corporate
[52:21.520 --> 52:27.760]  global groups. Secretly negotiated. The public couldn't even see it. It was already basically
[52:27.760 --> 52:35.200]  passed and agreed upon globally. And they just put Obama up there with some jazz blues singers.
[52:35.200 --> 52:41.360]  And he says he's down with TPP like, you know, one of those rap songs. So it's cute and funny.
[52:41.360 --> 52:47.840]  This is making becoming slaves to global government funny. And it's not funny. Here's that clip.
[52:47.840 --> 52:49.840]  Now hold on there, Fred dispenser.
[52:49.840 --> 53:00.880]  Are you saying you're down with TPP? Yeah, you know me.
[53:02.880 --> 53:08.880]  So it's cool. It's fun. It's cute. The lighting's perfect. It's all scripted. They're great actors,
[53:08.880 --> 53:14.320]  and they just screwed that audience hardcore. President, are you down with having a secret
[53:14.320 --> 53:18.800]  of global government group leverage out what jobs we've got left and exploit people with slave
[53:18.800 --> 53:26.320]  labor? The TPP actually doesn't outlaw slavery and actually makes it legal again. Are you for that?
[53:27.600 --> 53:33.040]  Yes, I'm down with that. All right. It's a very, very serious subject.
[53:34.960 --> 53:37.600]  And I've gone over it now with a little bit of humor here.
[53:39.200 --> 53:42.480]  Maybe a little funnier if you're actually watching on television, but for radio listeners,
[53:42.480 --> 53:49.360]  obviously, the next few hours we'll have that clip of a live transmission posted up on infowars.com.
[53:52.400 --> 54:00.080]  But they admit these exchanges are scripted. So it's a fact. Or you can believe lying crooked
[54:00.080 --> 54:05.680]  Hillary. But getting back to some of the latest news that she says is a conspiracy theory, top
[54:05.680 --> 54:10.960]  doctor concerns over Hillary's health, not a conspiracy theory. Rutgers University Professor
[54:10.960 --> 54:15.920]  of Medicine says Clinton should be assessed by an impartial panel of physicians. What did Dr.
[54:15.920 --> 54:21.200]  Pocenick sound the show last week? Just that. Here's a new article up on infowars.com and
[54:21.200 --> 54:26.320]  presentplanet.com that everybody needs to get out there. WikiLeaks emails. Hillary looked into
[54:26.320 --> 54:41.360]  Parkinson's drug after suffering from decision fatigue. Wow. That is spooky deceptive, wrote Clinton.
[54:41.360 --> 54:45.600]  Or that is spooky descriptive. Excuse me. I'm having a Freudian slip about what I really
[54:45.600 --> 54:51.120]  think she thinks. Emails released by WikiLeaks show that Hillary Clinton looked into a drug used
[54:51.120 --> 54:57.520]  to treat sleepiness and Parkinson's disease after she apparently began suffering from decision fatigue.
[54:57.520 --> 55:03.360]  Oh boy. Her own email. She has decision fatigue. That's exactly what Donald Trump's been saying.
[55:03.360 --> 55:10.080]  She goes out, gives us 10 minute speech, disappears for three days, napping. And they come out and
[55:10.080 --> 55:19.600]  they say, how dare you? How dare you claim that this lady doesn't have stamina? We're not saying
[55:19.600 --> 55:23.760]  there aren't women that have more stamina than men. In fact, a lot of old women have more stamina
[55:23.760 --> 55:30.640]  than old men, in my experience. Case in point, my grandmothers. Women live longer than men. No
[55:30.640 --> 55:37.600]  one's saying that. We're saying Hillary Clinton looks like she got run over by a bus. And half the
[55:37.600 --> 55:45.920]  time looks like a crew of insane monkeys did her hair. I mean, all the time she walks out and just
[55:45.920 --> 55:51.280]  looks all bedraggled. What is going on with this woman? They're getting her out of bed. She has to
[55:51.280 --> 55:56.240]  run off. A guy follows her around with a pen in his hand that basically injects you with different
[55:56.240 --> 56:04.800]  types of tranquilizers. They won't tell us what type. Incredible. Clinton sent an email to close
[56:04.800 --> 56:10.400]  confidant advisor Cheryl D. Mills on August 9, 2011. This is five years later, folks. Now,
[56:10.400 --> 56:15.040]  she looks like hell now. Featuring the text of an article entitled, Do You Suffer from Decision
[56:15.040 --> 56:19.280]  Fatigue? The article talks about how people in positions of power and influence, except from
[56:19.280 --> 56:25.680]  decision fatigue, that causes them to be low on mental energy and promotes the sufferer to
[56:25.680 --> 56:33.120]  become reckless and impulsive. And it goes on to say it can also treat Parkinson's. But there's
[56:33.120 --> 56:38.640]  nothing going on here. There's nothing to be seen. Go back to sleep, everyone. I'm going to stop right
[56:38.640 --> 56:43.600]  there. And we're going to come back and get into this article that has been put up by The Daily
[56:43.600 --> 56:49.360]  Caller. Joe Big shot a video on it. It's on infowars.com. U.S. Army's slide lists Hillary
[56:49.360 --> 56:55.920]  Clinton as a security threat. We'll also get into the latest Uma Abidine. That's Hillary's girlfriend
[56:55.920 --> 56:59.920]  that runs the radical Muslim journals, where it says that women should basically be kept inside
[56:59.920 --> 57:05.120]  like parakeets. But it's okay because she's trendy. Uma Abidine left classified material
[57:05.120 --> 57:09.680]  unsecured in the front seat of her car. That's okay. Trump calls for independent investigation
[57:09.680 --> 57:14.800]  of Clinton email crimes. Giuliani says Clinton Foundation is a racketeering enterprise, took

[01:00:20.320 --> 01:00:30.400]  Live from the infowarsteam.com studios, it's Alex Jones. Roger Stone's airplane should be touching
[01:00:30.400 --> 01:00:35.120]  down about now and we're like 10 minutes from the airport. He should be here in about 30, 40 minutes
[01:00:35.120 --> 01:00:40.160]  for the balance of transmission. Donald Trump is in the ATX today. I guess he'll be arriving later in
[01:00:40.160 --> 01:00:48.560]  his wide-body jet aircraft to speak to a capacity crowd at the Travis County Expo Center in North
[01:00:48.560 --> 01:00:56.880]  Austin. Our crew will be there. Now, before we do have our guests joining us in the studio,
[01:00:56.880 --> 01:01:09.520]  there is a lot to cover. But I wanted to first get a little bit more into... It's not that I don't
[01:01:09.520 --> 01:01:14.160]  have enough news. I have too much. I was talking to the crew during the break and I'm just looking
[01:01:14.160 --> 01:01:19.680]  at all this insane stuff to cover and I'm wondering where should I start next? This is a short segment.
[01:01:19.680 --> 01:01:24.720]  So I'm thinking, let me just read headlines so you know what's coming up in this segment.
[01:01:24.720 --> 01:01:31.360]  Let's just do that. Administration near Syrian refugee goal, 9,077 Muslims, 47 Christians.
[01:01:31.360 --> 01:01:37.440]  That's CNS news, but that's a total government cover. They've brought in 10,000 refugees into
[01:01:37.440 --> 01:01:44.240]  Austin or I am a possums uncle and they always say they're from Syria. That's just the catch-all term.
[01:01:45.920 --> 01:01:49.120]  Southern command warms, Sunni extremists infiltrating from the south.
[01:01:51.200 --> 01:01:55.760]  FBI reportedly investigating whether Virginia stabbings were ISIS inspired and they admit
[01:01:55.760 --> 01:02:02.400]  the guy was trying to go join ISIS in Syria and was on a watchlist, Fox News, but he yelled Allah
[01:02:02.400 --> 01:02:07.920]  Akbar while he stabbed him and tried to cut their heads off. In fact, we have the clip, but
[01:02:07.920 --> 01:02:15.200]  they're wondering whether it was Islamic related. Here it is. Attempted ISIS style beheading taking
[01:02:15.200 --> 01:02:22.480]  place inside the United States. The FBI is now investigating after Wasil Farooqi savagely stabbed
[01:02:22.480 --> 01:02:29.280]  a man and a woman and allegedly tried to behead them inside a Roanoke Virginia apartment while
[01:02:29.280 --> 01:02:34.800]  yelling Allah Akbar. Now, what's even scarier is that he seems to have chosen his victims at random.
[01:02:34.800 --> 01:02:39.520]  He had no relationship with these victims whatsoever. He's been on the radar of authorities
[01:02:39.520 --> 01:02:43.920]  since trying to sneak into Syria last year. We're just getting this information into our
[01:02:43.920 --> 01:02:48.320]  newsroom. We'll bring you more as we get it. And by the way, you see these every couple of days
[01:02:48.320 --> 01:02:54.160]  in France or Germany, like I saw one where it was a cop and his cop wife, but they were liberals and
[01:02:54.160 --> 01:02:59.920]  they brought the jihadi in and then he killed them. And the liberals were like, well, it's still
[01:02:59.920 --> 01:03:07.680]  sweet, loving. And it's always like real creepy where these jihadists will just randomly pick
[01:03:07.680 --> 01:03:12.000]  like some family or something and just go in and just stab them in their house or apartment.
[01:03:15.120 --> 01:03:20.320]  And it's like, it's like if somebody's yelling, how Hitler and, you know, shooting black people,
[01:03:20.320 --> 01:03:29.440]  is it Nazi related? I mean, this is just getting so ridiculous. So I've got that here.
[01:03:32.480 --> 01:03:37.040]  I'm going to cover this a little bit later and get really serious. Hundreds of California children
[01:03:37.040 --> 01:03:44.960]  sent home on first day of school in a new vaccine lump. Now, that's CBS News. And normally over the
[01:03:44.960 --> 01:03:51.120]  years I would say this is a total hoax because in the past it was a hoax. Nowhere in the country do
[01:03:51.120 --> 01:03:56.240]  they have laws saying you couldn't attend school if you didn't take vaccines. They had regulations
[01:03:56.240 --> 01:04:00.400]  saying they wanted you to fill out a form for the health department that you weren't going to take
[01:04:00.400 --> 01:04:03.680]  them. It wasn't really a law. It was a regulation, but it was to give you the idea that you were
[01:04:03.680 --> 01:04:11.120]  criminal. California passed a law that got rid of religious and conscientious. So basically
[01:04:11.120 --> 01:04:17.760]  it, it's nine tenths of a forced inoculation. They leave in their medical where you can go find
[01:04:17.760 --> 01:04:22.480]  doctors that say, yeah, you may have an autoimmune response or yeah, there's inserts in here. So
[01:04:22.480 --> 01:04:26.640]  you've got to take this. What you have to do is tell the school nurse or the school, fine,
[01:04:26.640 --> 01:04:31.760]  you sign a waiver form saying you indemnify me and it'll take care of me for any of these insert
[01:04:31.760 --> 01:04:36.480]  reactions and I'll do it. And they'll let you in the school and leave you alone. It's a pure criminal
[01:04:36.480 --> 01:04:42.960]  intimidation and it is a fraud still because they imply in the article and the TV story
[01:04:43.760 --> 01:04:48.080]  there's a text of it. It is an article. They love to tell a proper form. They read it off,
[01:04:48.080 --> 01:04:53.440]  they call it TV news, but it is an article. So that's a little factoid right there. They imply
[01:04:53.440 --> 01:04:58.400]  it is the law and don't tell you about the medical exemption. So there's the facts.
[01:04:58.400 --> 01:05:07.040]  Joe Biggs here with info wars.com. And this is an email from family Gino. I took down my rebel
[01:05:07.040 --> 01:05:12.720]  flag, which you can't buy on eBay anymore and pill the NRA sticker off my rear car window. I
[01:05:12.720 --> 01:05:18.160]  disconnected my home alarm system and quit the Kandy ass neighborhood watch. I bought two pack of
[01:05:18.160 --> 01:05:23.120]  sandy flags and put one at each corner of the front yard. Then I purchased the black flag of
[01:05:23.120 --> 01:05:29.040]  ISIS, which you can buy on eBay and ran it up the flagpole. Now the local police, sheriff, FBI,
[01:05:29.040 --> 01:05:35.360]  CIA, NSA, Homeland Security and other agencies are all watching my house 24 seven. I've never
[01:05:35.360 --> 01:05:42.240]  felt safer and I'm saving 69.95 a month that ADT use to charge me. Plus I bought burkas for my
[01:05:42.240 --> 01:05:46.880]  wife and I to wear when we shop or travel. Everyone moves out of the way and security can't pat us
[01:05:46.880 --> 01:05:51.120]  down. If they say I'm a male wearing a burka, I just say I'm feeling like a woman today.
[01:05:51.120 --> 01:05:57.440]  Hot damn. Safe at last. Ain't America great. You can find more reports like this info wars.com.

[01:08:39.200 --> 01:08:45.280]  you know let me recap what our top story is today and then I'm going to burrow into all the news
[01:08:45.920 --> 01:08:51.360]  we haven't gotten to yet ahead of Roger Stone who just landed in Austin Texas and is going to be
[01:08:51.360 --> 01:08:58.480]  in studio with us later in the hour coming into town for Trump's visits to Austin
[01:08:58.480 --> 01:09:10.160]  uh later this afternoon this is Reuters OSCE that is a EU UN organization. In fact it is part of
[01:09:10.160 --> 01:09:18.400]  the corporate setup that created the UN. The OSCE rights group requests 500 international observers
[01:09:18.400 --> 01:09:26.720]  to monitor US presidential vote for Hillary Clinton but Trump's a kook because he said election fraud
[01:09:26.720 --> 01:09:34.640]  exists but the UN wants 10 times what they had in 2012 to monitor our elections but I
[01:09:34.640 --> 01:09:39.840]  thought there's no such thing as monitoring because Obama said election fraud what's that
[01:09:42.480 --> 01:09:49.920]  simply incredible. Meanwhile the Jerusalem post comes out and I'm going to read this whole article
[01:09:49.920 --> 01:09:59.280]  later in the third hour today maybe even the fourth. Our world Soros's campaign of global chaos
[01:09:59.840 --> 01:10:06.160]  this isn't Alex Jones saying this the first thing that we see is the megalomaniacal nature
[01:10:06.160 --> 01:10:13.040]  of Soros's philanthropic project no corner of the globe is unaffected by his efforts no policy area
[01:10:13.040 --> 01:10:18.800]  is left untouched and you can read magazine interviews he gave 30 years ago where he said he
[01:10:18.800 --> 01:10:26.400]  believes he is the messiah but that he had to keep it secret a weirdo Nazi collaborator
[01:10:27.200 --> 01:10:31.600]  that funds radical jihadist is the new emails republic to help take over the west
[01:10:33.280 --> 01:10:34.720]  this guy is a demonic freak
[01:10:37.040 --> 01:10:41.920]  and the Jerusalem posted their credit David Eitnein for almost three weeks of an asking every day
[01:10:41.920 --> 01:10:48.800]  where's the coverage in the U.S. press zero and they admit this hack this is his emails
[01:10:48.800 --> 01:10:54.000]  so much evil stuff how to get our guns how to dissolve our borders he admits in here it's to
[01:10:54.000 --> 01:11:00.880]  rewrite voting districts major media outlets in the U.S. have ignored the leak of thousands of
[01:11:00.880 --> 01:11:06.160]  emails from billionaire George Soros's open society foundation by the activist group and activist
[01:11:06.160 --> 01:11:12.000]  group DC leaks the OSF in the vehicle through which Soros has funneled billions of dollars over
[01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:17.440]  the past two decades the nonprofit organizations the U.S. and throughout the world then it goes
[01:11:17.440 --> 01:11:22.880]  into how he's funding Hillary how he's funding jihadis and all the different things that he's
[01:11:22.880 --> 01:11:29.440]  doing and how horrible and evil he is and how he wants to attack the police and how he's funding
[01:11:29.440 --> 01:11:34.800]  black lives matter and how he wants to destabilize and people say to me okay but you know there's
[01:11:34.800 --> 01:11:40.320]  some bad cops why are you against black lives matter Soros created it it's White House just
[01:11:40.320 --> 01:11:46.160]  department run it wants a destabilization campaign you think our government's bad now wait till we
[01:11:46.160 --> 01:11:53.920]  get a real Soros government Soros submitted five years ago in leaked political documents
[01:11:54.480 --> 01:11:59.760]  that his group run by the White House to this day media matters was going to infiltrate the
[01:11:59.760 --> 01:12:06.480]  independent press from within hire people and then have them basically claim false reports
[01:12:08.160 --> 01:12:17.200]  that's called espionage in the French it happened to news core we've had groups connected to this
[01:12:17.200 --> 01:12:24.000]  organization try to penetrate us this isn't a game people you understand that
[01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:31.840]  here's another one so that's Reuters Jerusalem post now another one yahoo news
[01:12:34.400 --> 01:12:40.000]  worldwide concern over too many immigrants study shows Paris tourism chief demand rescue plan
[01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:47.200]  as a tax scare off half their visitors but it doesn't matter the EU chief Jean-Claude Juncker
[01:12:47.200 --> 01:12:54.480]  says quote borders are the worst invention ever yeah like bulkhead doors on submarines those were
[01:12:54.480 --> 01:13:06.160]  a horrible one too or when Jacques Cousteau invented the personal diving tanks that was a
[01:13:06.160 --> 01:13:11.920]  horrible invention if you want to go underwater without borders you have no sovereignty you have
[01:13:11.920 --> 01:13:16.880]  no culture you will be conquered you'll be overrun and and and that's why we have all these clips
[01:13:16.880 --> 01:13:24.320]  of people like this particular individual in the head of the Green Party in Europe and the democratic
[01:13:26.160 --> 01:13:34.160]  VP Joe Biden saying it's wonderful white people are going away it's good then things will be happy
[01:13:35.280 --> 01:13:41.680]  and the current VP candidate saying whites being a minority is good it'll teach us what it's like
[01:13:41.680 --> 01:13:49.040]  that's not even what's going on here it's phrasing things the opposite of what Martin Luther King
[01:13:49.040 --> 01:13:57.520]  said where everything is based on race instead of being based on rights and freedoms that everyone
[01:13:57.520 --> 01:14:02.560]  has that's how they feel all of our rights is just obsessing over all this garbage I mean look at
[01:14:02.560 --> 01:14:13.200]  this new one over here schools across the country are going to let men compete as women in sports
[01:14:13.760 --> 01:14:18.400]  Utah College formally allows men on women's sports teams and it's happening all over the country
[01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:24.080]  yeah what about getting rid of people's real rights to actually compete in their league
[01:14:24.720 --> 01:14:30.560]  they're getting rid of all definitions which gets rid of individuality it's it's an inverted
[01:14:30.560 --> 01:14:41.040]  program of control and we have them saying get rid of borders completely but what do they replace it
[01:14:41.040 --> 01:14:46.800]  with global corporate government run by the founder of the EU now the head of the UN program on
[01:14:46.800 --> 01:14:54.080]  migrants and borders Peter Sutherland who says we're bringing in a world government and we're
[01:14:54.080 --> 01:14:58.480]  going to use third world population to overthrow the west that is the engine of wealth so that we
[01:14:58.480 --> 01:15:05.040]  control it and because the immigrants won't be able to assimilate and won't be able to get jobs
[01:15:05.040 --> 01:15:09.280]  because they bring them in from the worst third world hellholes they will then be managed by the
[01:15:09.280 --> 01:15:15.760]  state but vote for the elite to keep their power structure in place this is 21st century warfare
[01:15:16.960 --> 01:15:23.440]  it's beyond organized crime and it goes on from there
[01:15:23.440 --> 01:15:29.920]  but before we go any further let's shift gears into the organized crime
[01:15:30.480 --> 01:15:35.600]  Giuliani love him or hate him he's telling the truth clinton foundation a racketeering
[01:15:35.600 --> 01:15:42.080]  enterprise took money from criminals and dictators we know that but now he's saying it
[01:15:42.080 --> 01:15:48.720]  now it's going mainstream that's trump taking the gloves off and that's why we have trump coming out
[01:15:48.720 --> 01:15:53.840]  also basically saying the same thing and then clinton making a joke about it a few weeks ago
[01:15:53.840 --> 01:16:01.840]  let's play that montage this is an insider versus outsider campaign she is the consummate
[01:16:02.480 --> 01:16:08.800]  corrupt washington insider and she is thoroughly corrupt and so is the clinton foundation if i
[01:16:08.800 --> 01:16:13.440]  were back in my old job as u.s. attorney i would probably indict the clinton foundation as a
[01:16:13.440 --> 01:16:20.480]  racketeering enterprise they took money from money launders criminals dictators people who
[01:16:20.480 --> 01:16:28.800]  abuse women as a matter of government policy she did favors for those very people who gave
[01:16:28.800 --> 01:16:35.040]  money to the clinton foundation for example ubs gave the clittons all together over a million
[01:16:35.040 --> 01:16:41.920]  dollars she made a call to the irs asking the irs to go easy on their attempts to get identities
[01:16:41.920 --> 01:16:48.560]  from ubs in my day that was considered bribery when i was a u.s. attorney and i prosecuted
[01:16:48.560 --> 01:16:54.080]  several very prominent politicians and convicted them of bribery racketeering including two congressmen
[01:16:54.080 --> 01:16:58.080]  what we've got to leave it there uh again the clinton foundation and all those associated say
[01:16:58.080 --> 01:17:01.840]  that they are not under investigation and that they've been clear and transparent so we will
[01:17:01.840 --> 01:17:06.240]  stay tuned because there are those who are earning the biggest bunch of garbage i have never heard
[01:17:06.240 --> 01:17:11.840]  mr. mayor we appreciate your time today bunch of garbage they are they are they are i believe under
[01:17:11.840 --> 01:17:17.120]  investigation there was a leak of that just the other day and number two if they're not the justice
[01:17:17.120 --> 01:17:22.320]  department should be ashamed of itself all right we got to leave it there thank you so much for
[01:17:22.320 --> 01:17:26.800]  joining fox news sunday sir we're gonna go to the trump club here in just a moment basically saying
[01:17:26.800 --> 01:17:31.360]  the same thing all they're doing though is looking up at the blue sky and saying it's a blue sky
[01:17:31.360 --> 01:17:41.600]  she took 35 million dollars and her chief of staff took money as well and then gave the russians
[01:17:41.600 --> 01:17:47.440]  one fifth of our uranium stockpile now imagine if trump was giving the russians our uranium
[01:17:48.400 --> 01:17:55.280]  imagine if trump took 100 plus million dollars in just the last few years from gulf states 24
[01:17:55.280 --> 01:18:06.400]  million from Saudi Arabia that executes gays but that's okay because these people are morally bankrupt
[01:18:06.400 --> 01:18:12.560]  and their supporters democrat party supporters are cult like zombies that don't really care about
[01:18:12.560 --> 01:18:17.440]  reality they don't really care about actually having human rights they want to feel good
[01:18:17.440 --> 01:18:21.680]  and feel like they're on the winning team so they can point their finger at other people
[01:18:21.680 --> 01:18:29.600]  here's donald trump as the evidence has become public over the last several months i've become
[01:18:29.600 --> 01:18:36.560]  increasingly shocked by the vast scope of hillary clinton's criminality it's criminality
[01:18:38.160 --> 01:18:44.960]  the amounts involved the favor is done and the significant number of times it was done
[01:18:44.960 --> 01:18:53.360]  and require an expedited investigation by a special prosecutor immediately immediately
[01:18:53.360 --> 01:19:03.200]  immediately after the fbi and the part of justice whitewash hillary clinton's email crimes they
[01:19:03.200 --> 01:19:10.720]  certainly cannot be trusted to quickly or impartially investigate hillary clinton's new crimes which
[01:19:10.720 --> 01:19:18.160]  happen all the time the justice department is required to appoint an independent special
[01:19:18.160 --> 01:19:26.880]  prosecutor because it has proven itself to be really sadly a political arm of the white house
[01:19:26.880 --> 01:19:31.200]  that's right and they think you're so stupid you know i had a profound thought this morning
[01:19:31.200 --> 01:19:34.400]  that i meant to open the show up with and i even wrote a note to do it and put it in my pocket
[01:19:34.400 --> 01:19:41.280]  but but but just remembered it trump is running like you're smart hillary's running like you're
[01:19:41.280 --> 01:19:45.760]  stupid because he came out and said we've got incredible election fraud and they said you're
[01:19:45.760 --> 01:19:53.520]  to cook doesn't exist and now the un is sending a record 500 plus observers saying there's evidence
[01:19:53.520 --> 01:20:02.400]  of election fraud of the u.s i mean this is amazing there's nothing convenient about shaving

[01:24:17.920 --> 01:24:24.240]  by the way remember about a month ago or less three weeks ago 400 million dollars
[01:24:24.240 --> 01:24:29.600]  was given to the iranians in exchange for hostages and the state department put out press releases
[01:24:29.600 --> 01:24:33.120]  and gave press conference and says this had nothing to do with this this is a payment for
[01:24:33.120 --> 01:24:38.880]  money owed for more than two decades and they also told congress that in a letter it was lying to
[01:24:38.880 --> 01:24:44.560]  congress now last week they came out and said okay it's true in a press conference we played the
[01:24:44.560 --> 01:24:54.400]  clips on friday and said yes it was a payment for hostages which now sets the precedent to take
[01:24:54.400 --> 01:25:00.160]  americans as hostages because the state department will pay you hundreds of millions of dollar bounty
[01:25:00.960 --> 01:25:06.400]  once you pay the pirate as redsker kippling said you better get ready to do it again and again
[01:25:06.400 --> 01:25:11.360]  and again i've had people before try to blackmail me and of course it was always with made up stuff
[01:25:11.360 --> 01:25:17.600]  too and i'm just like go make that up right now please do it because they've never been in the
[01:25:17.600 --> 01:25:21.920]  media they've never been around they haven't had thousands of fake allegations met about them before
[01:25:23.040 --> 01:25:31.200]  i have people try to blackmail me on a semi-routine basis and i tell you i love it because if i ever
[01:25:31.200 --> 01:25:41.920]  even did something i'm not ever going to be blackmailed comprende but the steadfast policy
[01:25:41.920 --> 01:25:46.000]  of not being blackmailed by the u.s government has now been reversed and so we can now be like
[01:25:46.000 --> 01:26:01.440]  guatemala or we can now be like nigeria or rwanda or some areas in the pacific and why not political
[01:26:01.440 --> 01:26:07.840]  state department confirms 400 million was a payoff ransom oh political said it so now it's true
[01:26:07.840 --> 01:26:13.840]  we'll guess what the conspiracy theorist weeks and weeks and weeks before you told the truth
[01:26:13.840 --> 01:26:23.280]  called you out as liars big steaming bowls and it ain't wolf brand chili how long's it been since you
[01:26:23.280 --> 01:26:32.080]  got a big old steaming bowl of hillary clinton bs well about every five seconds remember the old
[01:26:32.080 --> 01:26:38.720]  wolf brand chili ads how long's it been since you had a big steaming bowl of wolf brand chili
[01:26:38.720 --> 01:26:47.600]  well that's too long now continuing unbelievable state department has no idea we're 400 million
[01:26:47.600 --> 01:26:54.400]  i ran money even went so there's a whole another uh facet to that a big article and some video
[01:26:54.400 --> 01:26:58.560]  clips that are very important from the state department up on info wars dot com by our own
[01:26:58.560 --> 01:27:06.240]  steve watson by the way steve watson has a degree in international affairs and in political science
[01:27:06.240 --> 01:27:13.920]  and is just as smart he's the big brother of paul joseph watson now a major media force in the world
[01:27:13.920 --> 01:27:21.600]  i mean he's he's up there at the top 30 40 people now and he's amazing and i wish i could get steve
[01:27:21.600 --> 01:27:28.880]  to work for us full time i've tried but uh he likes to play the guitar and be in a band
[01:27:30.240 --> 01:27:35.360]  and i guess that's a good thing but you know steve we need you full time my friend i just want to
[01:27:35.360 --> 01:27:43.600]  say steve watson is an amazing guy just as smart as paul and i just i need every soldier i can get
[01:27:43.600 --> 01:27:48.640]  and it is so frustrating you know he should be a general and instead he wants to be a sergeant
[01:27:48.640 --> 01:27:53.920]  which is great sergeants do great things they make the fight go around but i need generals at this time
[01:27:53.920 --> 01:27:57.600]  that actually know what they're doing there's plenty of people out there that want to be generals
[01:27:57.600 --> 01:28:04.480]  but actually don't want to do the work i mean if you want to use an evil analogy like i'm sure on
[01:28:04.480 --> 01:28:08.720]  i mean he could be a powerful ringwraith in the fight but if we're at we're on the other side but
[01:28:08.720 --> 01:28:16.320]  you know what i mean uh so we've got that going on speaking of uh sergeants staff sergeants uh
[01:28:16.320 --> 01:28:23.840]  joe biggs is a great sergeant he did a report on this world net daily report and there's also
[01:28:23.840 --> 01:28:28.000]  one on a daily caller and the army says they're not going to comment on it which means it's real
[01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:34.800]  u.s army slide lists hillary clonson as security threat they called me about this yesterday because
[01:28:34.800 --> 01:28:40.080]  i was out doing some errands they go yeah the army has a slide saying she's a she's a threat and i went
[01:28:40.080 --> 01:28:43.280]  and they listed terrorist in the article i thought that sounds weird but then i realized
[01:28:43.280 --> 01:28:50.240]  it's a security threat like a leaker and of course she is one because she stored stuff on servers
[01:28:50.240 --> 01:28:54.240]  knowing it had been penetrated now they list snowden as a leaker and a security threat to
[01:28:54.240 --> 01:28:58.880]  the traitor and i don't think he is because he didn't expose people's names he exposed the
[01:28:58.880 --> 01:29:04.160]  unconstitutional programs that are being used to control our country that's not my opinion that's
[01:29:04.160 --> 01:29:10.880]  the constitution that's common sense but again we were told forever that this stuff doesn't exist
[01:29:10.880 --> 01:29:15.280]  there's no nsa spying there's no keyword spying there's no hubs inside the telecommunications
[01:29:15.280 --> 01:29:21.120]  companies that are nsa but of course everything whistleblowers told me 19 years ago 18 years ago
[01:29:21.120 --> 01:29:25.840]  i mean i was at the cutting edge of exposing this with whistleblowers but back then there'd be
[01:29:25.840 --> 01:29:33.520]  almost no coverage but i had a wane madson on or james bamford on or you name it i mean wane madson
[01:29:33.520 --> 01:29:40.480]  has exposed stuff in the nsa almost as big as snowden but see he did it 18 19 years ago but
[01:29:40.480 --> 01:29:45.920]  back when they didn't arrest whistleblowers that exposed criminal activity nowadays he'd be locked
[01:29:45.920 --> 01:29:52.320]  up or have to run to russia stay with us we'll be back we're on the march the empires on the run
[01:29:53.120 --> 01:29:56.000]  alex jones and the gcn radio network
[01:30:00.080 --> 01:30:06.240]  search engine users want to know why hillary is dodging the press not one but two of the five
[01:30:06.240 --> 01:30:11.920]  most popular search questions in the past day concern hillary's apparent lack of press conferences
[01:30:11.920 --> 01:30:17.600]  according to a tweet posted on google trends official twitter account the search trends correlate
[01:30:17.600 --> 01:30:23.360]  with responses from former new york city mayor rudy juliani during a fox news sunday interview
[01:30:23.360 --> 01:30:28.400]  in which he pointed out how the clinton media machine is working double time against trump
[01:30:28.400 --> 01:30:35.200]  monday august 22 mark the 260 second day without a presser for the hillary team according to the
[01:30:35.200 --> 01:30:40.880]  washington post meanwhile on the other side of the ranch hall joseph watson has the article google

[01:34:23.680 --> 01:34:30.400]  very powerful report posted at info wars dot com new report white's actually more likely to be shot
[01:34:30.400 --> 01:34:38.480]  by police and now we know this but this has been really put together in a very powerful
[01:34:40.800 --> 01:34:46.320]  presentation um and so we're going to be looking at that in detail
[01:34:46.320 --> 01:34:51.680]  now before i go to that

[01:36:23.680 --> 01:36:29.200]  here's what scott from an undisclosed location said five stars i follow the directions of the
[01:36:29.200 --> 01:36:36.240]  bottle and i have noticed a big difference now i feel this is a great product it just had to
[01:36:36.240 --> 01:36:41.120]  go after little worms and stuff that most people have it goes after bacteria and toxic things that
[01:36:41.120 --> 01:36:46.240]  are in your body releasing toxins that's a nice way of saying using your guts like a latrine
[01:36:46.960 --> 01:36:50.960]  living defense love this stuff just the smell of it tells me it's the real deal
[01:36:50.960 --> 01:36:59.280]  dr group is the man and uh that's handsheds from san diego california yeah it's amazing and that's
[01:36:59.280 --> 01:37:03.600]  why we sell out all the time because if you got 30 something ingredients in it and each one has to
[01:37:03.600 --> 01:37:08.560]  be california standards which basically means you can't find anything in it i mean the air has more
[01:37:08.560 --> 01:37:14.000]  toxins than than than this does then it's really hard to get batches under that clean but we do it
[01:37:14.640 --> 01:37:19.040]  and that's why it sells out it's why a lot of people don't sell nutraceuticals in california
[01:37:19.040 --> 01:37:25.280]  because the law is basically passed where you it's very hard to do it but we like to be at the
[01:37:25.280 --> 01:37:32.560]  highest standards so we're able to do it uh also the new ameragadan film that we exclusively have
[01:37:32.560 --> 01:37:40.160]  the rights to until august 3rd you can get it for 1995 an amazing film that deals with the
[01:37:40.160 --> 01:37:44.800]  the globalist different false flag scenarios like emps that they've been known to be looking into
[01:37:44.800 --> 01:37:51.360]  and researching 1995 get a second copy for 1995 and then get three of my films free all supplies
[01:37:51.360 --> 01:37:57.840]  last or a bottle of colloidal silver silver bullet and when i say wall supplies last i had 20
[01:37:57.840 --> 01:38:02.800]  something titles we've sold out of 12 titles we're down to eight titles and so as they sell out we're

[01:38:13.920 --> 01:38:18.080]  price and a lot of folks ask me you know why do you discount something out of the gates it's what
[01:38:18.080 --> 01:38:24.240]  i like to do i mean i like to give people a good deal and also i like to get my films out there uh

[01:38:39.040 --> 01:38:43.840]  are now exclusively available at info or store dot com or by calling toll three eight eight eight
[01:38:43.840 --> 01:38:48.720]  two five three three one three nine that's eight eight eight two five three three one three nine
[01:38:48.720 --> 01:38:59.040]  now this is a subject fraught with political correctness but i'm not going to be politically
[01:38:59.040 --> 01:39:08.080]  correct because i genuinely care about everyone and not because i'm virtue signaling i have real
[01:39:08.080 --> 01:39:16.080]  empathy if i close the door which happens invariably once a year or so on a little pink gecko
[01:39:16.880 --> 01:39:21.040]  that are all over my house no matter where i've lived they're all over central texas
[01:39:21.040 --> 01:39:29.920]  and cut the little guy in half i get really sad and i say oh i'm sorry sweetie and i get a napkin
[01:39:29.920 --> 01:39:34.160]  and if he's flopping around i crush his little head or her little head not because i enjoy it
[01:39:34.160 --> 01:39:40.160]  but because i have empathy and i'm gonna be honest with you i get a tear in my eye now i'm a predator
[01:39:40.160 --> 01:39:45.120]  humans are designed to be predators but not against their own species and so it's complex psychology
[01:39:46.480 --> 01:39:52.080]  but if i go out and shoot a deer that's a prey animal that as a human i'm designed to kill
[01:39:52.960 --> 01:39:56.560]  or if i kill it with a bow or however i take it out and i'm designed to butcher it not because
[01:39:56.560 --> 01:40:00.800]  i want to kill an animal but because i'm designed just like a great white shark eating a seal
[01:40:00.800 --> 01:40:05.760]  but i'm not designed to eat little geckos so i think of it as like a little baby it's it's cute
[01:40:05.760 --> 01:40:13.280]  it's not my prey so i'm sad and then there are other predator animals that will kill the species
[01:40:13.280 --> 01:40:19.840]  they mainly feed on but then we'll take in and cuddle and baby another species wolves have been
[01:40:19.840 --> 01:40:28.000]  documented to take in humans the globalist are predators against us all basically and that's
[01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:32.240]  not natural we don't want to base a society on being predators on each other that creates
[01:40:32.800 --> 01:40:39.360]  an economy of conquest not an innovation a system that implodes not a system that grows
[01:40:39.360 --> 01:40:45.920]  not a system we want to be in and there's never a perfect utopia between a a a renaissance economy
[01:40:45.920 --> 01:40:52.720]  and a barbarous oppression economy we're always somewhere in between the conquest economy and the
[01:40:52.720 --> 01:41:00.880]  free market win-win economy but i want to move towards the 360 win system now that said i've
[01:41:00.880 --> 01:41:06.720]  studied epigenetics and i have really looked into it deeply and and most top scientists now
[01:41:07.360 --> 01:41:14.480]  across the field of human behaviorism no this is a fact you call it instincts and i've studied
[01:41:14.480 --> 01:41:19.120]  and if i was a professor i'd go to the research and put a paper out i actually quantify it all
[01:41:19.120 --> 01:41:24.400]  down but i'm going from memory here so this is a gestalt on a dead reckoning i wouldn't call
[01:41:24.400 --> 01:41:29.120]  it scientific just a theory now i'm being a conspiracy theorist when i do that i put a
[01:41:29.120 --> 01:41:38.080]  hat on to tell folks i'm doing it but if you look at europe a thousand years ago it was still
[01:41:38.080 --> 01:41:45.280]  barbarous very very dangerous and the murder rate if you go back and look at some of the histories
[01:41:45.280 --> 01:41:53.840]  was very very very very high if you look at england or london pacifically 500 600 years ago
[01:41:53.840 --> 01:42:01.280]  they banned christmas for a while because there were riots so bad in london that sometimes tens of
[01:42:01.280 --> 01:42:05.120]  thousands of people would die at night and a third of the city would burn down i mean look
[01:42:05.120 --> 01:42:09.760]  it up yourself i've read mainline history books on the subject it was incredible and what am i getting
[01:42:09.760 --> 01:42:21.040]  at here there was a thug life thug culture where it was cool to run around killing people and and
[01:42:21.040 --> 01:42:27.200]  just a law's a fair rape murder burn things down christianity was trying to reform that but in many
[01:42:27.200 --> 01:42:32.640]  cases it would break back out and that was because epigenetically the people that you saw there was
[01:42:32.640 --> 01:42:40.800]  also culture from bingbong barbarians it wasn't the iqs these were smart people it was the culture
[01:42:40.800 --> 01:42:49.680]  and the epigenetics of just being a few generations off the farm but in those days you had to fight
[01:42:49.680 --> 01:42:56.240]  on a basically weekly basis just to not have your farm taken so it's like street fighting meets the
[01:42:56.240 --> 01:42:59.840]  farm that's why they've got big university studies you can google them showing whether it was somebody
[01:42:59.840 --> 01:43:05.280]  in africa five thousand years ago or somebody in europe five thousand years ago they were stronger
[01:43:05.280 --> 01:43:10.480]  than the strongest powerlifters faster runners than anybody alive today because they hadn't
[01:43:10.480 --> 01:43:15.760]  been brought into modern society and weren't basically being domesticated so it's an issue
[01:43:15.760 --> 01:43:21.120]  of domestication versus being wild it's not an issue of saying someone's primitive or someone's
[01:43:21.120 --> 01:43:26.640]  evil or someone's bad but see the globalist aren't coming in to our cultures to try to
[01:43:26.640 --> 01:43:34.880]  domesticate us so we're nice and loving and like star trek they are doing this to absolutely make us
[01:43:34.880 --> 01:43:41.680]  stand down and be overrun and enslaved so i think it's good to get back to being more primitive
[01:43:41.680 --> 01:43:46.800]  because that's not primitive in the word that's more advanced when it comes to standing up for
[01:43:46.800 --> 01:43:52.480]  yourself but the globalists know how to manipulate that and they have beta tested first with rock and
[01:43:52.480 --> 01:43:57.760]  roll rebellion in the 60s and the sexual revolution to break up the family and i'm not up here on a
[01:43:57.760 --> 01:44:01.680]  high horse about sex i'm simply and i have read the white papers on this so most of this is
[01:44:01.680 --> 01:44:06.240]  documented fact they did it to break down the family to break down the culture they beta tested
[01:44:07.040 --> 01:44:12.640]  in black communities particularly bio weapons and and and drug dealing so a lot of that's been
[01:44:12.640 --> 01:44:18.320]  done culturally also to create a higher crime rate but then they used gangster rap and other
[01:44:18.320 --> 01:44:24.640]  systems in the 80s this has come out cia to create a culture a fake warrior culture of killing each
[01:44:24.640 --> 01:44:30.160]  other for pointless reasons and not caring to prep people for the present population now the
[01:44:30.160 --> 01:44:34.960]  globalists have moved on worldwide with this weaponized system against everyone and it's had
[01:44:34.960 --> 01:44:39.520]  devastating effects and we've talked a lot about that and i've talked to major rock stars major
[01:44:39.520 --> 01:44:44.320]  record executives some of the biggest in the world off record not people you've heard on air
[01:44:44.320 --> 01:44:51.680]  also maybe some you have but these aren't the ones i'm talking about where they were there in
[01:44:51.680 --> 01:44:55.680]  the 90s saying you better get into gangster thugism or you're not going to be on air what do
[01:44:55.680 --> 01:45:01.200]  you mean we're at the top of the charts we don't care we've been directed to go with this that's
[01:45:01.200 --> 01:45:06.400]  why you see kind of rap country music now that's all thugged out and rock and roll that's all
[01:45:06.400 --> 01:45:12.560]  thugged out that's a directive that if you want to be on air you do that and this is to artificially
[01:45:12.560 --> 01:45:18.480]  express epigenetics to be violent and to try to artificially bring those back and so that's
[01:45:18.480 --> 01:45:24.880]  what's going on here but it doesn't matter if you are say a white person being targeted by races
[01:45:24.880 --> 01:45:29.840]  black people because in the cosmology you deserve it because you're bad at some form of reparations
[01:45:29.840 --> 01:45:35.200]  it has to be decried as racist and evil but the left is covering it up because they want to continue
[01:45:35.200 --> 01:45:42.000]  this paradigm on into the future so that they can imprison populations while claiming they
[01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:53.200]  represent them but paint them with the red letter of criminal while using that threat to then set
[01:45:53.200 --> 01:45:57.920]  up a police state that controls all the other so-called populations and by that really just
[01:45:57.920 --> 01:46:02.960]  middle-class populations that have escaped poorer areas this is systems of social engineering
[01:46:05.520 --> 01:46:08.960]  and you can look at the statistics some of the best statistics in the world come from the FBI
[01:46:08.960 --> 01:46:14.080]  because statistics started in the modern age with the FBI that's well known some of them are
[01:46:14.080 --> 01:46:19.200]  adulterated certainly some crime statistics get manipulated but they're amongst some of the best
[01:46:19.200 --> 01:46:24.560]  because it's hard to cover up you know the actual number of murders say in the United States things
[01:46:24.560 --> 01:46:29.200]  like rape obviously are under reported but when it comes to armed robbery bank robberies that's
[01:46:29.200 --> 01:46:37.440]  well documented and almost all of it is on record so when these big studies come out proving this
[01:46:37.440 --> 01:46:42.320]  the media doesn't want to cover it because it doesn't fit into the world view that inherently
[01:46:42.320 --> 01:46:47.680]  white people are evil and that's why these problems are happening the truth is there are evil people
[01:46:47.680 --> 01:46:54.240]  of every color who join together in organized crime syndicates to prey on the general public
[01:46:54.240 --> 01:46:59.840]  by keeping us dumb down by keeping us in the dark and by manipulating us and then by setting up
[01:46:59.840 --> 01:47:05.440]  false cultures that we're supposed to follow that are designed to sabotage and destroy us
[01:47:05.440 --> 01:47:13.440]  and basically prep some of the pre-existing problems in the system to exacerbate it and not
[01:47:13.440 --> 01:47:19.840]  let the crisis go to waste so that said Heather McDonald with Prager University made a very
[01:47:19.840 --> 01:47:26.320]  powerful video that's up on info wars.com in a report whites actually way more likely to be
[01:47:26.320 --> 01:47:34.000]  shot by police and it gets into a lot more than just that and these are the latest numbers now
[01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:43.360]  it's just like what we see with gun crime crimes using guns have been flat the last few years
[01:47:44.080 --> 01:47:51.840]  that it was dropping since 1992 over 60 on average but the perception is there's massive massive
[01:47:51.840 --> 01:47:56.480]  massive crime with guns being used there's also a perception that police officers are killing blacks
[01:47:56.480 --> 01:48:03.360]  at exponential and mass that's used as the cover by the very people that on record social engineered
[01:48:03.360 --> 01:48:10.320]  in the 50s and 60s as a beta test the black community now again it's come out the secret
[01:48:10.320 --> 01:48:15.120]  testing in the black community but the media will only cover it when it's the black community
[01:48:15.920 --> 01:48:19.920]  not because they care about black people but because when this stuff first started coming out
[01:48:20.640 --> 01:48:27.120]  it could be seen as more palatable with a background of real racism that was stronger at the time to
[01:48:27.120 --> 01:48:31.920]  then have the whole thing be shut down when you actually research there's secret testing going on
[01:48:31.920 --> 01:48:38.160]  against everybody in every major country against every major military the globalist religion
[01:48:39.200 --> 01:48:46.720]  is about suppressing and controlling populations and it's all about constantly testing scientifically
[01:48:46.720 --> 01:48:53.200]  to understand how we take to know how to control us and to train and test the testers to see what
[01:48:53.200 --> 01:49:00.080]  populations will they test on what will they do in fact almost all the children that were radiated
[01:49:00.080 --> 01:49:10.240]  to death gearing and after the atomic project the Manhattan project were white poor white children
[01:49:10.880 --> 01:49:15.920]  but they actually got some religious groups in the country to even donate their children and
[01:49:15.920 --> 01:49:23.760]  their young men to be tested on lethally now if you don't believe me you need to research that
[01:49:23.760 --> 01:49:30.400]  and by the way I know this sounds incredible folks but that's how controlled some of the
[01:49:30.400 --> 01:49:36.160]  Christian groups in this country were they believe like Christ to actually go submit to being killed
[01:49:37.760 --> 01:49:43.360]  in many cases that's the seventh day Adventists by the way so this is hardcore folks this is
[01:49:43.360 --> 01:49:48.000]  hardcore you need to understand this let's go to this report this is something they do not want
[01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:54.080]  you to see and you get this out to everybody here at us does the truth matter not to groups like
[01:49:54.080 --> 01:50:00.480]  black lives matter that's tragic for many reasons not the least of which is that black lives are
[01:50:00.480 --> 01:50:06.720]  being lost as a result when it comes to the subject of american police blacks and the deadly use of
[01:50:06.720 --> 01:50:13.360]  force here is what we know a recent deadly force study by washington state university researcher
[01:50:13.360 --> 01:50:19.280]  lois james found that police officers were less likely to shoot unarmed black suspects
[01:50:19.280 --> 01:50:24.640]  than unarmed white or hispanic ones in simulated threat scenarios harvard economics professor
[01:50:24.640 --> 01:50:31.040]  roland fryer analyzed more than 1000 officer involved shootings across the country he concluded
[01:50:31.040 --> 01:50:38.480]  that there is zero evidence of racial bias in police shootings in houston he found that blacks
[01:50:38.480 --> 01:50:45.440]  were 24% less likely than whites to be shot by officers even though the suspects were armed or
[01:50:45.440 --> 01:50:52.640]  violent does the truth matter an analysis of the washington post's police shooting database
[01:50:52.640 --> 01:50:59.520]  and a federal crime statistics reveals that fully 12% of all whites and hispanics who die of homicide
[01:50:59.520 --> 01:51:07.040]  are killed by cops by contrast only 4% of black homicide victims are killed by cops
[01:51:07.040 --> 01:51:13.680]  but isn't it a sign of bias that blacks make up 26% of police shooting victims
[01:51:14.240 --> 01:51:22.960]  but only 13% of the national population it is not and common sense suggests why police shootings
[01:51:22.960 --> 01:51:29.120]  occur more frequently where officers confront armed or violently resisting suspects those
[01:51:29.120 --> 01:51:34.640]  suspects are disproportionately black according to the most recent study by the department of
[01:51:34.640 --> 01:51:41.040]  justice although blacks were only about 15% of the population in the 75 largest counties in the
[01:51:41.040 --> 01:51:51.360]  u.s. they were charged with 62% of all robberies 57% of murders and 45% of assaults in new york
[01:51:51.360 --> 01:51:58.240]  city blacks commit over three quarters of all shootings though they are only 23% of the city's
[01:51:58.240 --> 01:52:06.880]  population whites by contrast commit under 2% of all shootings in the city though they are 34%
[01:52:06.880 --> 01:52:13.760]  of the population new york's crime disparities are repeated in virtually every racially diverse
[01:52:13.760 --> 01:52:20.640]  city in america the real problem facing inner city black communities today is not the police
[01:52:20.640 --> 01:52:28.320]  but criminals in 2014 over 6000 blacks were murdered more than all white and hispanic homicide
[01:52:28.320 --> 01:52:37.200]  victims combined who is killing them not the police and not white civilians but other blacks in fact
[01:52:37.200 --> 01:52:44.640]  a police officer is 18 and a half times more likely to be killed by a black male than an unarmed
[01:52:44.640 --> 01:52:52.400]  black male is to be killed by a police officer if the police ended all use of lethal force tomorrow
[01:52:52.400 --> 01:52:59.920]  it would have a negligible impact on the black death by homicide rate in chicago through just the
[01:52:59.920 --> 01:53:09.360]  first six and a half months of 2016 over 2300 people were shot that's a shooting an hour during
[01:53:09.360 --> 01:53:16.080]  some weekends the vast majority of the victims were black during the same period the chicago
[01:53:16.080 --> 01:53:24.080]  police shot 12 people all armed and dangerous that's one half of one percent of all shootings
[01:53:24.960 --> 01:53:32.880]  does the truth matter if it does here's a truth worth pondering there is no government agency
[01:53:32.880 --> 01:53:39.600]  more dedicated to the proposition that black lives matter than the police the proactive policing
[01:53:39.600 --> 01:53:45.280]  revolution that began in the mid 1990s has dramatically brought down the inner city murder
[01:53:45.280 --> 01:53:52.880]  rate and saved tens of thousands of black lives unfortunately that crime decline is now in jeopardy
[01:53:53.600 --> 01:53:59.440]  as i write in my book the war on cops police officers are backing off of proactive policing
[01:53:59.440 --> 01:54:05.040]  in black neighborhoods thanks to the false narrative that police officers are infected with
[01:54:05.040 --> 01:54:12.640]  homicidal bias as a result violent crime is going up in cities with large black populations
[01:54:12.640 --> 01:54:20.480]  homicides in 2015 rose anywhere from 54 percent in washington dc to 90 percent in cleveland
[01:54:21.120 --> 01:54:28.320]  overall in the nation's 56 largest cities homicides in 2015 rose 17 percent a nearly
[01:54:28.320 --> 01:54:36.080]  unprecedented one-year spike many law-abiding residents of high crime areas beg the police to
[01:54:36.080 --> 01:54:42.880]  maintain order precisely the type of policing that the aclu progressive politicians and the
[01:54:42.880 --> 01:54:50.480]  obama justice department denounced as racist this is tragic because when the police refrain from
[01:54:50.480 --> 01:54:58.720]  proactive policing black lives are lost lost because of a myth the best research and data
[01:54:58.720 --> 01:55:04.640]  reached this conclusion there is no evidence that police are killing blacks just because they're
[01:55:04.640 --> 01:55:12.400]  black you now have the truth does it matter i'm heather mcdonnell of the manhattan institute
[01:55:12.400 --> 01:55:21.520]  for prager university i want to be clear everyone knows this that's ever followed
[01:55:21.520 --> 01:55:27.040]  what i've done over 20 plus years that i'm known as the anti-police state guy i'm known as the
[01:55:27.040 --> 01:55:32.080]  person that's against warrantless seizures i'm the guy against that warned of drones and that
[01:55:32.080 --> 01:55:38.640]  warned of the nsa spying and that warned of all the different uh red light cameras and systems
[01:55:38.640 --> 01:55:43.200]  but you talk to the average cop they don't like all that they say tell the politicians to change it
[01:55:44.400 --> 01:55:47.840]  i'm not one of these people though they're just in some mindless lovefest with police
[01:55:47.840 --> 01:55:55.520]  because i like to watch cop shows on tv i understand the formulae that has been used to overthrow
[01:55:55.520 --> 01:56:02.720]  countless countries in the 20th and 21st century by communists and you ask well you say it's
[01:56:02.720 --> 01:56:09.360]  megabanks doing this why is it the same formula because it was megabanks in 1917 this is a
[01:56:09.360 --> 01:56:15.280]  undisputed history that funded the bolshevik revolution they wanted a group of communists
[01:56:15.280 --> 01:56:20.640]  to run the country and slave the people and make deals with them for raw material
[01:56:22.400 --> 01:56:28.640]  communism is a tool of the ultra tax exempt rich that's why warren buffett supports it that's why
[01:56:28.640 --> 01:56:33.840]  henry kissinger supports it that's why ted turner supports it that's why bill gates supports it
[01:56:33.840 --> 01:56:39.520]  because our tax exempt and until people figure out this paradigm and read the book none dare call
[01:56:39.520 --> 01:56:45.920]  a conspiracy from their own documents i think we still sell that book we don't have a future
[01:56:46.960 --> 01:56:49.680]  it's finally back in print i know we were selling it for a while is it available

[01:57:37.200 --> 01:57:43.200]  had myself and my one or two crew members early on who were volunteers we went to the ut library
[01:57:43.200 --> 01:57:48.960]  and others we'd do day trips sometimes to dallas in places or listers would go to the micro fishing

[02:01:19.920 --> 02:01:26.880]  looking to weaken america you couldn't do better than hillary clinton's economic agenda i think
[02:01:26.880 --> 02:01:33.440]  what the chinese have done is really smart the skyscrapers went up in beijing and many other
[02:01:33.440 --> 02:01:41.040]  cities around the world while the factories and neighborhoods crumbled right here in detroit it's
[02:01:41.040 --> 02:01:46.960]  all training us to accept less lowering expectations a post-industrial world a new dark age that's what
[02:01:46.960 --> 02:01:54.240]  the un biological diversity assessment 1996 calls for when we abandoned the policy of america first
[02:01:54.960 --> 02:02:01.600]  we started rebuilding other countries instead of our own not a world wenson that gets more beautiful
[02:02:01.600 --> 02:02:06.880]  and more technological and stronger a world that gets uglier and stupider and more stunting that
[02:02:08.960 --> 02:02:13.840]  government should allow hillary clinton to become president of the united states

[02:04:54.720 --> 02:05:01.200]  outlets but uh yeah it's it's the only response that they have talk about that first in an unbelievable
[02:05:01.200 --> 02:05:07.680]  exchange with reporters state department spokesman mark toner admitted that he has no idea who picked
[02:05:07.680 --> 02:05:13.440]  up the 400 million dollars in cash that was put on a plane to iran toner claimed that the old
[02:05:13.440 --> 02:05:18.880]  bomb administration knows where the money went do you know who picked up the money asked associated
[02:05:18.880 --> 02:05:25.760]  press reporter bradley clapper i don't reply toner who'd you pay clapper asked i believe it was iranian
[02:05:25.760 --> 02:05:30.960]  officials and iranian government officials but i don't know particularly who individually it was
[02:05:30.960 --> 02:05:36.320]  toner said do you know which part of the iranian government you paid clapper asked i don't have
[02:05:36.320 --> 02:05:42.320]  that information no toner said does the administration know who paid it clapper asked i'm certain they
[02:05:42.320 --> 02:05:48.000]  would say yes toner answered and this isn't the first time the obama administration has acted on

[02:08:58.800 --> 02:09:02.560]  google stuff about him it's interesting and spend hours you know reading new york times
[02:09:02.560 --> 02:09:08.160]  articles about him from the 70s 80s and 90s but he's really an interesting guy now of course
[02:09:08.160 --> 02:09:12.880]  longtime confidant of donald trump his first campaign manager a guy that really helped push
[02:09:12.880 --> 02:09:19.280]  trump you know to make his own decision to run and then we've seen several other campaign heads

[02:09:59.600 --> 02:10:05.280]  basically take over the country more important than ever his crew designed the bill clinton
[02:10:05.280 --> 02:10:09.920]  rape shirt that looks like the hope shirt exclusively available at infowarstore.com
[02:10:09.920 --> 02:10:15.840]  uh the first thing i want to cover with roger stone today i love showing the rape shirt because it
[02:10:15.840 --> 02:10:21.440]  caused sinker ugarik or whatever his name is the young turds totally flipped out uh when he saw
[02:10:21.440 --> 02:10:25.680]  you 20 feet away walking by with it i mean he's just crazy but but before we get back into that
[02:10:27.280 --> 02:10:31.840]  drudge came here a year ago and he said listen i talked to a supreme court justice i saw about
[02:10:31.840 --> 02:10:35.840]  this every day because it's so so pertinent now it's happening and he said next year they're
[02:10:35.840 --> 02:10:39.120]  going to start the process of handing the internet over to the un they're going to start
[02:10:39.120 --> 02:10:43.600]  censoring they're going to turn loose the federal elections commission and they're going to start
[02:10:43.600 --> 02:10:48.880]  shutting down the independent patriot medium i talked to sources and i can also hear the
[02:10:49.680 --> 02:10:56.080]  democrats the zars the senators saying shut down drudge federal elections commission shut down
[02:10:56.080 --> 02:11:02.480]  news core fox shut down limbaugh and then they started saying shut down info wars i'm political
[02:11:02.480 --> 02:11:07.600]  well yeah i mean if being pro gun is political damn right i am so but i'm a libertarian cut my
[02:11:07.600 --> 02:11:11.360]  teeth going after clinton and the bushes you name it just like you've been you know critical bush
[02:11:11.360 --> 02:11:15.760]  after you learn what he was doing in iraq i'm just setting the table here that we're not
[02:11:15.760 --> 02:11:22.720]  just saying this it's now in public democratic party fundraising emails daily caller info wars and
[02:11:22.720 --> 02:11:28.480]  of course bright but reported on it last week to say quote mainline conservatives have a right to
[02:11:28.480 --> 02:11:32.880]  exist well that means they want to get them to what a creepy term right it's like the final solution
[02:11:32.880 --> 02:11:39.280]  jews have no rights to exist then they say but groups like breitbart don't and when we get hillary
[02:11:39.280 --> 02:11:45.120]  in we're shutting them down breitbart is way bigger than new york times drudge is the number one
[02:11:45.120 --> 02:11:51.280]  news site in the world with more traffic than facebook twitter the new york times combined now
[02:11:51.280 --> 02:11:56.160]  down that list of the top hundred sites if you combine how they said free speech systems and and
[02:11:56.160 --> 02:12:01.600]  my other sites individually had us at like 80 and 90 we're like 50 and technically i'm not
[02:12:01.600 --> 02:12:05.280]  bragging here but we're bigger than breitbart when it comes to overall not just our site but the
[02:12:05.280 --> 02:12:08.800]  whole aggregate i don't want to be bigger than breitbart i want to defeat the new world order i'm
[02:12:08.800 --> 02:12:13.280]  glad breitbart's big i hope it gets 10 times bigger the point is when i say they're coming after
[02:12:13.840 --> 02:12:19.200]  the free press they had a coup at fox they now admit they infiltrated they admit the white
[02:12:19.200 --> 02:12:23.440]  houses involved they admit democrats are involved media matters and memos said they were going to
[02:12:23.440 --> 02:12:29.120]  infiltrate we're next so that means you're next folks when they take away your voice they take
[02:12:29.120 --> 02:12:33.520]  everything away so we can put the daily caller headline up there where they said no right to
[02:12:33.520 --> 02:12:39.680]  exist for breitbart when they say that they now see breitbart as the lead elephant because of
[02:12:39.680 --> 02:12:44.720]  steven bannon now you've got the floor to talk about free speech the attacks the demonization
[02:12:44.720 --> 02:12:51.920]  the season we are in of disinformation roger stone now you're absolutely right uh last week i spoke
[02:12:51.920 --> 02:12:58.400]  on uh c span about um the easy ability to hack these electing machine election machines these
[02:12:58.400 --> 02:13:04.480]  computerized voting machines uh and uh citing a study at stanford university that shows that the
[02:13:04.480 --> 02:13:10.400]  clinton's have already done it to bernie sanders in at least 12 states uh also citing the work of
[02:13:10.400 --> 02:13:16.720]  a princeton professor uh all a professor at columbus uh state community college uh robert
[02:13:16.720 --> 02:13:23.120]  fitrakes who wrote a terrific book uh strip and flip and strip about how these machines are manipulated
[02:13:23.120 --> 02:13:30.080]  so there's no mechanical engineering or scientific evidence that the machines cannot be fixed easily
[02:13:30.080 --> 02:13:35.600]  therefore their argument is uh well we have to rely on the integrity of the clinton's not to do this
[02:13:35.600 --> 02:13:41.360]  sorry but this machine the this election is easily rigged now when i said that media matters for
[02:13:41.360 --> 02:13:47.920]  america the uh the hillary front group run by david brock uh immediately demanded that c span banned
[02:13:47.920 --> 02:13:54.240]  me uh whenever i i uh published a long piece at the hill they immediately began to demand that the
[02:13:54.240 --> 02:14:00.160]  hill banned roger stone as if my views are not valid only their views are valid it's censorship
[02:14:00.160 --> 02:14:04.160]  it worked for hitler it worked for stalin and now they're trying to make it work for hillary clinton
[02:14:05.120 --> 02:14:11.760]  i want you to continue but just think about i'm almost breathless here this is so epic so historic
[02:14:11.760 --> 02:14:16.800]  where they actually call for you to be banned when they ordered msnbc and cnn to ban you they did it
[02:14:16.800 --> 02:14:21.840]  they are the talking points and now they admitted the emails the white house is meeting with google
[02:14:22.480 --> 02:14:27.280]  it's meeting with facebook twitter weekly it's meeting with cnn it's telling them what to do
[02:14:27.280 --> 02:14:33.920]  what questions to ask everything to say and now they're promising to actually shut us down
[02:14:34.480 --> 02:14:41.360]  our own outlets if they get in this is now a referendum this election on the free press
[02:14:41.360 --> 02:14:47.520]  more than anything and then that's a and then b they said donald trump was insane three weeks ago
[02:14:47.520 --> 02:14:50.800]  when he came out and said they tried to steal the nomination from me they did from bernie
[02:14:51.440 --> 02:14:57.280]  we need to have election watchers now the u n roiders is reporting for the clinton's and the
[02:14:57.280 --> 02:15:02.560]  justice department is asking for 10 times the monitors they had in 2012 to basically run the
[02:15:02.560 --> 02:15:07.280]  elections and as you warned last time you were on before they did this you said i would watch the
[02:15:07.280 --> 02:15:12.400]  watchers that's who will be stealing go ahead roger that's exactly right alex i mean a couple
[02:15:12.400 --> 02:15:18.800]  things are going on here at once first of all anyone who raises questions about the clinton's
[02:15:18.800 --> 02:15:24.640]  their record their corruption bills history as a sexual predator you're immediately branded a
[02:15:24.640 --> 02:15:32.720]  conspiracy theorist now you know the genesis of that phrase it goes back to 1964 cia memo that said
[02:15:32.720 --> 02:15:37.520]  anytime anybody surfaces to question the results of the war and commission and president kennedy's
[02:15:37.520 --> 02:15:43.520]  death immediately brand them as a conspiracy theorist in order to undermine their credibility
[02:15:43.520 --> 02:15:49.280]  here we are again uh they keep accusing us of being conspiracy theorists no we're conspiracy
[02:15:49.280 --> 02:15:53.920]  realists uh because we continue to point out the crimes of the clinton's and we're not going to
[02:15:53.920 --> 02:15:59.200]  stop we continue to point out the lies of the clinton's and we're not going to stop what i found
[02:15:59.200 --> 02:16:05.520]  alex it's really chilling uh i've yet to be verified at twitter uh people keep setting up
[02:16:05.520 --> 02:16:11.920]  fake roger stone profiles and they try to launch them uh and i've asked several times to be verified
[02:16:11.920 --> 02:16:18.320]  i've provided all their forms all their information the fact that i have this problem on twitter
[02:16:18.320 --> 02:16:24.240]  yet i cannot get verified i was denied yet again today more disturbing though is that i put up a
[02:16:24.240 --> 02:16:30.160]  provocative tweet about hillary clinton that's factual people will retweet it then they contact me
[02:16:30.160 --> 02:16:37.120]  and they say i retweeted what you put up but it's disappeared well they now admit google admits
[02:16:37.120 --> 02:16:42.240]  that they are delisting the clinton death list they are delisting donald trump uh they are delisting
[02:16:42.240 --> 02:16:48.240]  basically her health problems and the new york times asked them a few days ago in an op-ed said
[02:16:48.240 --> 02:16:55.280]  please delist um her health problems and her health videos so they're now communicating the
[02:16:55.280 --> 02:17:01.200]  establishment from the new york times to google oh by the way we forgot to whack this mole ban this
[02:17:01.200 --> 02:17:05.840]  yeah no it's exactly true which is uh i think a great segue into the question of hillary's health
[02:17:06.480 --> 02:17:12.640]  uh the uh the spokesman for hillary clinton attacked me by name several days ago saying
[02:17:12.640 --> 02:17:18.800]  that this was all a right-wing conspiracy uh and that i am promoting documents online that are for
[02:17:18.800 --> 02:17:23.200]  you never put those up i never put them up uh i find them interesting i have no idea whether
[02:17:23.200 --> 02:17:29.440]  they're real or not real but my concerns about hillary's health come from my own eyes the photographs
[02:17:29.440 --> 02:17:36.800]  the videos uh her being her being in the hospital for a year in 2012-13 her stumbling around uh look
[02:17:36.800 --> 02:17:41.920]  we have medical doctors on fox news the heads of major university divisions coming out saying quote
[02:17:41.920 --> 02:17:47.440]  it's no conspiracy theory we now have a wiki leak coming out uh with her wanting parkinson's medication
[02:17:47.440 --> 02:17:54.080]  in her emails yeah it's extraordinary that they are running a cover-up on this when uh my view on
[02:17:54.080 --> 02:17:58.640]  her health is not based on some document online that may or may not have been real i didn't even
[02:17:58.640 --> 02:18:03.760]  read it what mom it looks like she's already in a coffin well and she's got an ulcer on her tongue
[02:18:03.760 --> 02:18:08.560]  she's got her head snapping around like she's on the exorcist what's that about so where's the green
[02:18:08.560 --> 02:18:13.840]  piece too exactly i mean she's got no stamina i think it's it's abundantly clear she is down
[02:18:13.840 --> 02:18:19.760]  trump has correctly said she does a campaign day where she does one stop they limit access to the
[02:18:19.760 --> 02:18:24.320]  press and then she takes five days off and does another stop she doesn't have the stamina
[02:18:24.320 --> 02:18:29.360]  or the mental clarity or the balance to be president of the united states that's not conjecture
[02:18:29.360 --> 02:18:33.760]  you can see this with your own eyes i want to go to break and come back and get into the health
[02:18:33.760 --> 02:18:39.120]  stuff but but what about just the arrogance of obama for six days he finally went today
[02:18:39.120 --> 02:18:45.200]  never going to the worst flooding than katrina and then hillary is flying planes 20 miles from
[02:18:45.200 --> 02:18:51.840]  martha's vineyard to nantucket and they just don't even care to go when this is what they
[02:18:51.840 --> 02:18:57.520]  destroyed the republicans with in 2008 was bush's response to katrina there's such a disconnect
[02:18:57.520 --> 02:19:03.360]  yeah no they excoriated bush for doing exactly what they are doing not taking care of business
[02:19:03.360 --> 02:19:09.360]  this is the job but to be fair and i don't want to defend bush he went down there i mean they
[02:19:09.360 --> 02:19:13.600]  i mean they just didn't give it down no that's exactly right but it was it was election time
[02:19:13.600 --> 02:19:18.480]  and therefore they needed to undermine him now obama doesn't do the job that he's elected to
[02:19:19.200 --> 02:19:23.920]  and nobody says anything it's that that's a show arrogance disconnect that she's ill i mean why did
[02:19:23.920 --> 02:19:28.720]  she run down there well she's probably not well enough to move around uh and they don't want to
[02:19:28.720 --> 02:19:32.960]  expose her i watched a video of her walking down the plane ramp the other day and she looked like
[02:19:32.960 --> 02:19:38.240]  she was bracing each step like she was in hell yeah the woman's not well it's visually obvious
[02:19:38.240 --> 02:19:42.720]  and now we have the big lie it's all our fault that her health is bad we're making the whole thing
[02:19:42.720 --> 02:19:47.760]  up because we're conspiracy stay right there because i have a concern my gut tells me roger stone
[02:19:48.400 --> 02:19:54.720]  that she's obviously seriously ill but she might coast in like a dead rat bouncing into the white

[02:24:10.080 --> 02:24:13.120]  in fact i'm going to give the number out right now your questions for roger stone about all
[02:24:13.120 --> 02:24:17.760]  things election 2016 and what's happening with trump but when this election is over here i'm
[02:24:17.760 --> 02:24:21.760]  flying you back to austin i want to do two three hours with you just about the whole history of
[02:24:21.760 --> 02:24:26.320]  the republican party in the modern age nixon you know all the books you've written on those
[02:24:26.320 --> 02:24:33.600]  subjects and just all the interesting lore that roger stone has for us uh and inside views and
[02:24:33.600 --> 02:24:37.200]  perspectives but i was thinking during the break about censorship again before we get back into
[02:24:37.200 --> 02:24:42.880]  the medical issues and how they respond because the two stories go together bezos of amazon who
[02:24:42.880 --> 02:24:47.120]  admits he's a clinton worshipper another multi-billionaire you know socialist
[02:24:47.120 --> 02:24:54.160]  osa washington post and makes it even worse than it was before which is hard to do which is hard to
[02:24:54.160 --> 02:25:00.400]  do with grand running it before now the worst newspaper in america now we've got carlo slim
[02:25:00.400 --> 02:25:05.520]  who on part of it now he's the majority owner of the new york times and the largest single donor
[02:25:05.520 --> 02:25:10.000]  to the clinton foundation and the clinton global initiative he's number one engaged in incredible
[02:25:10.000 --> 02:25:15.920]  disinformation but no wonder they want to censor us and now admit they want to shut us down with a
[02:25:15.920 --> 02:25:22.480]  six percent national trust rating in an ap study of tens of thousands of respondents it's bigger than
[02:25:22.480 --> 02:25:27.600]  just wanting to shut us down we have to understand i mean i'm not bragging info wars reaches 28 million
[02:25:27.600 --> 02:25:33.280]  people a week this radio show just on terrestrial radio three million people a day over five million
[02:25:33.280 --> 02:25:37.360]  youtube views over three or four million facebook views a day you add it all together it's much
[02:25:37.360 --> 02:25:42.080]  bigger than 28 million that's conservative these people are a joke and they already know they've
[02:25:42.080 --> 02:25:48.560]  collapsed roger stone that only means it's that much worse they are coming to shut us down like
[02:25:48.560 --> 02:25:56.320]  like uh matt drudge said yeah i know i think i think their plan uh is is uh painfully obvious uh
[02:25:56.320 --> 02:26:01.680]  you you here's the difference between what we're seeing now and everything i've seen in in eight
[02:26:01.680 --> 02:26:08.400]  previous presidential campaigns in the past the media uh pretended to be objective they still
[02:26:08.400 --> 02:26:13.680]  tried to screw the conservative candidate but all the time pretending to be objective now
[02:26:13.680 --> 02:26:19.600]  they've dropped all pretense of trying to be objective it is hysterical in their efforts
[02:26:19.600 --> 02:26:25.440]  to get donald trump to smear him to distort what he says to magnify minor mistakes that he's made
[02:26:25.440 --> 02:26:30.640]  he's not a career politician as he said the other day which i think was actually a very positive
[02:26:30.640 --> 02:26:36.160]  he doesn't go always get it exactly right but when he makes a small mistake they magnify it out of
[02:26:36.160 --> 02:26:42.560]  all proportion when hillary gets caught taking bribes or lying they barely cover it in fact most
[02:26:42.560 --> 02:26:48.800]  cases they don't cover it at all they've dropped all pretense uh of uh of being objective now
[02:26:48.800 --> 02:26:55.040]  they just seek to stop the reform candidacy of donald trump because it scares the daylights
[02:26:55.040 --> 02:27:00.480]  out of them he would bust up the k street wall street combine none of them are giving him any
[02:27:00.480 --> 02:27:05.520]  money that is the total certification he's the real deal yeah yesterday's finance report showed him
[02:27:05.520 --> 02:27:12.800]  at 38 million dollars cash on hand uh in retrospect it may become clear if he raises the same
[02:27:12.800 --> 02:27:17.920]  amount in say the next 80 days which is probable that he would have been better off taking public
[02:27:17.920 --> 02:27:23.600]  finance and then running as much fundraising he could through affiliated super PACs as hillary has
[02:27:23.600 --> 02:27:28.480]  done uh it with her super PACs he would have gotten a hundred million dollars from public
[02:27:28.480 --> 02:27:33.840]  finance without raising a dime uh and he wouldn't have a recommendation i did recommend that yes
[02:27:33.840 --> 02:27:39.040]  and i think it's going to be borne out as have he would have had more net dollars for the fight had
[02:27:39.040 --> 02:27:45.360]  he done so well the establishment has zipped their wallets this is so colossal i i overused the word
[02:27:45.360 --> 02:27:52.080]  epic but this is the epic of epic this is the crème dalle crème where the evil corrupt pope the evil
[02:27:52.080 --> 02:27:58.080]  corrupt chinese president the evil corrupt mexican president the saudi corrupt filth royal family every
[02:27:58.080 --> 02:28:08.640]  every every festering nest of corruption and evil hates donald trump every global combine every
[02:28:08.640 --> 02:28:14.400]  stinking hedge fund and then the moron fake liberals run around behind hillary but a lot
[02:28:14.400 --> 02:28:18.160]  of them i talked to you actually aren't morons and are supporting trump because they know saners
[02:28:18.160 --> 02:28:22.880]  was stolen i think that's really the missing army that will put trump up at the top and that's why
[02:28:22.880 --> 02:28:27.920]  i think there's election fraud if he doesn't win this is why the candidacy of both uh jill stein the
[02:28:27.920 --> 02:28:32.480]  green party candidate and gary johnson the libertarian party candidate are so important
[02:28:32.480 --> 02:28:38.640]  the criteria of the presidential commission on debates which is by the way not appointed by the
[02:28:38.640 --> 02:28:44.240]  president not a commission and not about debates is headed by a former republican national chairman
[02:28:44.240 --> 02:28:49.040]  and democratic national chairman their goal keep everybody else out of the political discussion
[02:28:49.040 --> 02:28:55.520]  now i think progressive voters would vote for jill stein given the the screwing of bernie sanders
[02:28:55.520 --> 02:29:01.360]  without vaseline according to the the wiki leaks documents where debora waserman schiltz was a
[02:29:01.360 --> 02:29:06.960]  mole for the clintons uh if they knew that her candidacy existed she has gotten on the ballot
[02:29:06.960 --> 02:29:11.600]  in 44 states all i see is leftist groups attacking her but that's because they're not real leftist
[02:29:11.600 --> 02:29:16.880]  groups no it's macartheism that's macartheism uh she's a legitimate candidate governor gary johnson's
[02:29:16.880 --> 02:29:21.920]  a legitimate candidate they should be in these debates first of all it is outrageous to not include
[02:29:21.920 --> 02:29:27.840]  them sure using some phony polling number creates the chicken and egg situation where
[02:29:27.840 --> 02:29:31.840]  they can't get to 15 percent because they're not in the debate and they can't get in the debate because
[02:29:31.840 --> 02:29:37.200]  they're not at 15 percent the criteria should be how many states are you in the ballot but we can
[02:29:37.200 --> 02:29:42.800]  never break the the the two-headed monster duopoly so trump finally came in and has done that he's
[02:29:42.800 --> 02:29:47.600]  taking over the republican party a libertarian populist insurrection and that's why everyone
[02:29:47.600 --> 02:29:54.320]  needs to support him including sanders people will be back the empires on the run alex jones and the

[02:33:33.200 --> 02:33:39.440]  i want to get into manifold and i know the true scoop on this and i know what went on and and
[02:33:39.440 --> 02:33:42.800]  there's no truth to it and that'll be coming out in the next few weeks i'm gonna stop there we're
[02:33:42.800 --> 02:33:47.360]  not gonna get much into that today but some but i really want to get into trump here in a moment
[02:33:47.360 --> 02:33:54.240]  because again roiders um associated press they're all reporting the justice department is bringing
[02:33:54.240 --> 02:34:04.800]  in the un and the european union this is roiders at ten fold the number they had four years ago
[02:34:04.800 --> 02:34:08.880]  to oversee the election because they're so concerned about fraud but they admit it's run by
[02:34:08.880 --> 02:34:14.400]  the justice department so they're going to go in there to i guess carry out the fraud that's what
[02:34:14.400 --> 02:34:20.560]  you warned of three weeks ago on air and it says right here a tenfold increase from the number of
[02:34:20.560 --> 02:34:26.880]  the group deployed in 2012 we're gonna get back to that here in just a moment but how are they still
[02:34:26.880 --> 02:34:32.400]  criticizing trump like he is an insane pterodactyl or something from another age
[02:34:33.520 --> 02:34:38.160]  obama's like what election fraud what are you talking about ridiculous you said it's ridiculous
[02:34:38.160 --> 02:34:43.840]  yesterday the new york times quotes this uh this uh political science professor in california
[02:34:43.840 --> 02:34:48.880]  asan who says this is read this is laughable no it's not laughable it's a reality first of all
[02:34:48.880 --> 02:34:53.280]  alex let's distinguish between voter fraud and election theft these are two different issues yeah
[02:34:53.280 --> 02:34:58.080]  the un's coming in to make sure election fraud can't happen they call it fraud if we don't let
[02:34:58.080 --> 02:35:02.880]  illegals vote yeah exactly so what's happened here is the state department has a set of criteria in
[02:35:02.880 --> 02:35:07.680]  which they judge foreign elections in terms of fairness so the headline is the un coming to the
[02:35:07.680 --> 02:35:12.640]  u.s to make sure illegals can vote sorry i think the real issue here is the state department
[02:35:12.640 --> 02:35:17.440]  standards for fair elections have been violated by hillary and at least 12 primaries against bernie
[02:35:18.240 --> 02:35:22.080]  that's how bad the steal is there that's why he has switched his registration
[02:35:22.080 --> 02:35:27.280]  from democrat back to an independent in in vermont what kind of signal does that send
[02:35:27.280 --> 02:35:33.920]  about hillary's candidacy uh and it is uh it's an absurdity uh to think that that the clinton's
[02:35:33.920 --> 02:35:40.240]  won't steal something that they can steal the issue of voter fraud meaning people voting multiple
[02:35:40.240 --> 02:35:45.360]  times people who are not eligible voting dead people who are still on the rolls voting that
[02:35:45.360 --> 02:35:51.440]  is a more limited problem it's not non-existent as the folks at huffington post say it's very
[02:35:51.440 --> 02:35:58.800]  much existence but it is dwarfed by the seriousness of the ability to rig these computerized voter
[02:35:58.800 --> 02:36:04.880]  machines we have a professor at princeton a professor at in ohio uh state community college
[02:36:04.880 --> 02:36:10.160]  we have we have the standard dive old chief engineers we have the stanford study we have a
[02:36:10.160 --> 02:36:16.480]  cbs video not exactly right wing media showing us how a 15 dollar device that you can get at
[02:36:16.480 --> 02:36:23.520]  radio shack or best buys will allow you to vote multiple times without being detected so are we
[02:36:23.520 --> 02:36:28.640]  counting on the good will and the integrity of the clinton's not to steal something which is
[02:36:28.640 --> 02:36:36.880]  technologically easily but wait i mean she's they've got jed johnson and they've got loretta
[02:36:36.880 --> 02:36:40.640]  lynch they're going to run it and keep it safe with the u n i mean they're good people we can
[02:36:40.640 --> 02:36:44.960]  trust them can't we yeah that's very concerning you got it as i said earlier on the program
[02:36:44.960 --> 02:36:49.600]  you've got to watch the watchers you've got to watch the watchers now how you can how can you
[02:36:49.600 --> 02:36:56.080]  combat that this is the real question we have uh we have re-energized stop the steal dot org
[02:36:56.080 --> 02:37:02.240]  stop the steal dot org has several goals number one we're going to demand inspection of the software
[02:37:02.240 --> 02:37:07.840]  for these voting machines in every jurisdiction where we suspect that they will be rigging if
[02:37:07.840 --> 02:37:13.680]  they will not let independent third parties examine the software it'll be clear that the fix
[02:37:13.680 --> 02:37:20.080]  is in secondarily we're going to uh conduct exit polls right outside the polling places
[02:37:20.080 --> 02:37:27.760]  to be able to match the exit poll results with the machine results now exit polls are scientifically
[02:37:28.480 --> 02:37:33.920]  and historically far more accurate than any form of voting and that's undisputed undisputed
[02:37:33.920 --> 02:37:37.680]  it's way better than polls and here's the reason for this because you're getting the voters'
[02:37:37.680 --> 02:37:43.840]  intention before they've heard the results you see once they hear the results and over time
[02:37:43.840 --> 02:37:48.320]  they begin to gravitate to the winner people want to have been with the winner but if you get them
[02:37:48.320 --> 02:37:53.920]  as they exit the booth they're far more likely to tell you and that's why they come out and say
[02:37:53.920 --> 02:37:58.400]  for a month he's dropping out he's dropping out he's dropping out intervention intervention
[02:37:58.400 --> 02:38:03.200]  intervention yes he's insane he's insane he's insane he's bankrupt he's bankrupt his wife's
[02:38:03.200 --> 02:38:07.360]  a prostitute even though they had to reverse all that and apologize because of a lawsuit it's all
[02:38:07.360 --> 02:38:11.920]  made up all fake is because they're creating the perception he's way behind all the polls
[02:38:11.920 --> 02:38:17.280]  they've got another polling company came out not just Reuters and added more democrats to samples
[02:38:17.280 --> 02:38:24.160]  than republicans when trump still won they added more democrats yeah gallop got got busted so i mean
[02:38:24.160 --> 02:38:29.680]  there's no end to these people i mean and this is an important part of the plan here's how it works
[02:38:29.680 --> 02:38:36.880]  first we rig the polls to create a public perception then we rig the machines to meet that
[02:38:36.880 --> 02:38:42.160]  perception first you let's say that again first you rig the polls to create the perception of what
[02:38:42.160 --> 02:38:48.400]  will happen then you rig the machines to meet the perception that you've created that's how this works
[02:38:49.120 --> 02:38:54.480]  and it's a legitimate issue but when you get when you get out there and discuss these things
[02:38:54.480 --> 02:38:59.440]  even with the backing of a stanford study a princeton professor this professor doc doctor
[02:38:59.440 --> 02:39:04.400]  patricus who's a terrific guy uh they call you a conspiracy i was about to say though we've got
[02:39:04.400 --> 02:39:10.160]  the heads of universities all these scientists democrats uh mainline tv hosts that are doctors
[02:39:10.160 --> 02:39:16.400]  saying she's clearly got neurological problems now we have her email saying i need parkinson's
[02:39:16.400 --> 02:39:22.320]  medication that is bombshell well we have an email in which she said that she cracked her head
[02:39:22.320 --> 02:39:26.160]  i'm not doing too good with a cracked head she says in the email i read that one this morning
[02:39:26.160 --> 02:39:32.240]  from wikileaks she clearly has a health problem we didn't make it up we're not falsifying it let's
[02:39:32.240 --> 02:39:36.000]  go back to my question i'm on your own two eyes let's go back to my question that it's my fault i
[02:39:36.000 --> 02:39:40.720]  never bought it back up because we went to break if they steal it they're already writing articles
[02:39:40.720 --> 02:39:44.560]  that they're scared trumps could have challenged it or they're planting the idea his candidacy was
[02:39:44.560 --> 02:39:48.640]  fake because he might want to start a patriot network well i read back five years ago he wanted
[02:39:48.640 --> 02:39:53.840]  to do that to save the country thank god if they cheat trump he's not planning on giving up yeah he's
[02:39:53.840 --> 02:39:59.040]  not going to roll over look you have to have real evidence you can't just lose and then say oh this
[02:39:59.040 --> 02:40:04.560]  was stolen from me this is why the stop to steal dot org operation is so important we're going to have
[02:40:04.560 --> 02:40:09.360]  a property run scientifically based on exit roger i agree and you're doing that you've done a great
[02:40:09.360 --> 02:40:12.560]  job we're going to be there with you we're going to support it the listeners are going to go you'd
[02:40:12.560 --> 02:40:17.840]  be part of it i mean they're ready what i'm saying is if they stole all those primaries from him but
[02:40:17.840 --> 02:40:22.880]  he said no and they had to back off they stole it from bernie openly right we have evidence that
[02:40:22.880 --> 02:40:27.040]  she's an illegitimate nominee and that's what i've been arguing the whole time don't just go out and
[02:40:27.040 --> 02:40:31.360]  say there's election fraud we've got to watch it so when they do it people understand that it was
[02:40:31.360 --> 02:40:36.960]  already an issue what about the fact that she's an illegitimate candidate that goes to your fact
[02:40:36.960 --> 02:40:41.280]  we should bring in other people from the debates well the the the democrats are the only ones who
[02:40:41.280 --> 02:40:45.520]  could object to that they're not going to because the clintons have malmowed most of the democrats
[02:40:45.520 --> 02:40:50.240]  in the court of public opinion i think he makes that an issue that this woman stole her nomination
[02:40:50.240 --> 02:40:55.840]  which they now have stanford university as you said yes did the research last week and in 12
[02:40:55.840 --> 02:41:02.080]  states they violated her own standards as secretary of state for uh for transparent election other
[02:41:02.080 --> 02:41:06.800]  people's countries exactly yeah she goes and monitors other elections obama goes and monitors
[02:41:06.800 --> 02:41:11.280]  but he's never heard of problems and elections by the way the the problems we're talking about
[02:41:11.280 --> 02:41:17.440]  are problems that former president jimmy carter has specifically criticized abroad and has
[02:41:17.440 --> 02:41:21.680]  criticized mildly in the united states in fact i saw where he actually came out and said no it's
[02:41:21.680 --> 02:41:26.960]  true we had problems yes uh so he certifies that these machines have been rigged you know say anything
[02:41:26.960 --> 02:41:30.880]  you want he figures out that bernie sanders got i gotta hand it to him but despite all his problems
[02:41:30.880 --> 02:41:35.760]  at the end of the day he really says what he thinks i think he believes in democracy uh i was never
[02:41:35.760 --> 02:41:40.160]  a great fan obviously helped uh defeat him in his efforts to get a second term while working for
[02:41:40.160 --> 02:41:45.920]  governor ronald reagan but in this issue i think he is a forceful spokesman and i hope he will speak
[02:41:45.920 --> 02:41:53.920]  out more on the question of voter fraud and election rigging all right so much energy so much to cover
[02:41:53.920 --> 02:41:59.120]  so much happening i want to get into manifold i want to get into the whole ukraine disinfo
[02:41:59.120 --> 02:42:02.720]  i want to cover the waterfront other issues you want to cover here roger and then and then take
[02:42:02.720 --> 02:42:09.120]  phone calls because they take us in some wildcard directions but you're always honest about what
[02:42:09.120 --> 02:42:12.160]  states you thought he was really going to win what states you thought he was going to lose
[02:42:12.160 --> 02:42:16.800]  off record with me you were always really accurate you you've told me that you think it's really a
[02:42:16.800 --> 02:42:23.600]  dead heat despite all their fake polling some poll show he's ahead where is trump really right now
[02:42:23.600 --> 02:42:30.240]  how is he doing what is 76 days out 77 days how many days out uh there were around 80 i guess look
[02:42:30.240 --> 02:42:34.720]  he's he's woefully underfunded but he's still the best communicator in the country he does these
[02:42:34.720 --> 02:42:41.040]  rallies and he's pulling 30 25 30 000 people she's doing rallies she gets 171 people they
[02:42:41.040 --> 02:42:46.800]  got to rearrange the cameras to try to make the crowds look bigger there's no enthusiasm for her
[02:42:46.800 --> 02:42:51.680]  campaign she was probably doing a pretty good job of bringing the progressives and liberals back in
[02:42:51.680 --> 02:42:57.600]  until wiki leaks to their credit leaked to the or the entire record of her theft of bernie sanders
[02:42:57.600 --> 02:43:02.480]  and i think that has cut off the progressive piece that's why i think it's important uh
[02:43:02.480 --> 02:43:07.440]  that progressives have additional choices sure what do you think of the li time saying that uh he
[02:43:07.440 --> 02:43:12.480]  isn't a dead heat with her right now yeah very very very telling it's impossible to say and by the
[02:43:12.480 --> 02:43:19.120]  way we have a very volatile electorate but based on uh anecdotal evidence and the enthusiasm you
[02:43:19.120 --> 02:43:24.000]  see around his candidacy and the lack of enthusiasm it's not reasonable to believe that he may be
[02:43:24.000 --> 02:43:28.400]  running well sure roughly even with her perhaps a few points behind by the way at this juncture i'd
[02:43:28.400 --> 02:43:33.600]  rather be behind than ahead now explain that because they have these top professors uh in
[02:43:33.600 --> 02:43:38.480]  fact this particular one this algorithm where he's done five elections always been accurate
[02:43:38.480 --> 02:43:44.400]  and whoever is ahead now for some reason always loses explain that to people plus
[02:43:44.400 --> 02:43:49.760]  all the big bot companies the advertising companies that are so dead on accurate amazon
[02:43:49.760 --> 02:43:55.280]  can package your product before you even decide to buy it with these bots they're saying the bot
[02:43:55.280 --> 02:44:00.960]  show trump landslide yeah it's interesting first of all i think it's important to note that governor
[02:44:00.960 --> 02:44:07.200]  ronald reagan uh trailed jimmy carter until the final week in the polls and pulled ahead the debates
[02:44:07.200 --> 02:44:12.000]  were an important part of that the debates for the debate for king the debates are absolutely key
[02:44:12.000 --> 02:44:18.000]  because it's an opportunity for trump to right to present the real trump and to put away the
[02:44:18.000 --> 02:44:25.440]  caricatures that have been drawn by the mainstream media secondarily uh the wiki leaks are going to
[02:44:25.440 --> 02:44:31.520]  be uh i think very determinative it it is absolutely clear now that those emails that the
[02:44:31.520 --> 02:44:38.320]  clinton hench women whom abedin who's getting some bad press today uh and uh sharyl mills
[02:44:38.320 --> 02:44:44.080]  thought they deleted aren't deleted at all that wiki leaks has them most likely the russians
[02:44:44.080 --> 02:44:48.560]  have them the chinese have them i know you've got some good contacts the israelis have them the
[02:44:48.560 --> 02:44:53.840]  soddies have them so they're multiple sources from which they could be leaked what's in them
[02:44:53.840 --> 02:44:58.640]  well the clintons have always said in terms of the clinton foundation not their defense has always
[02:44:58.640 --> 02:45:04.960]  been not we didn't do it their defense has been you have no proof well perhaps now we do have the
[02:45:04.960 --> 02:45:11.040]  proof perhaps now we do have the smoking gun so for example when a russian consortium gave big
[02:45:11.040 --> 02:45:16.160]  bucks to the clinton foundation to return for cornering the market on uranium production
[02:45:16.160 --> 02:45:21.680]  the clinton's position was well you can't prove there was a quid pro quo well maybe now we can
[02:45:21.680 --> 02:45:28.560]  or let's take the ukraine because it's a good segue victor uh ping chuck who gave 10 million
[02:45:28.560 --> 02:45:34.240]  dollars to the clinton foundation and return he got the state department's support for toppling
[02:45:34.240 --> 02:45:41.040]  a democratic election elected official elected president in ukraine outrageous he wasn't impeached
[02:45:41.040 --> 02:45:48.160]  he wasn't beaten in a fair election he was physically removed meanwhile manifold is bad
[02:45:48.160 --> 02:45:53.760]  because he simply supported earlier in ukraine a general election which he's worked all over the
[02:45:53.760 --> 02:45:59.120]  world yeah no he did two parliamentary elections and then a presidential election building the party
[02:45:59.120 --> 02:46:03.280]  state through three cycles let me tell you something as a political consultant you try
[02:46:03.280 --> 02:46:08.880]  electing a guy named kauzanovsky to the parliament in ukraine in a district that has more cows than
[02:46:08.880 --> 02:46:14.080]  people this is not glamorous work he never worked for the ukrainian government he never worked for
[02:46:14.080 --> 02:46:18.560]  the russian government he has not required to file anything in washington because he didn't lobby
[02:46:18.560 --> 02:46:23.680]  anybody in washington the whole thing is a canard but to the extent that there is ukrainian influence
[02:46:23.680 --> 02:46:31.200]  in this election yes indeed victor pin chuck uh purchased the state department's approval of a
[02:46:31.200 --> 02:46:37.120]  toppling of a of a death everything hillary accuses trump of she's doing and and let's let me say one
[02:46:37.120 --> 02:46:42.720]  other thing and i think this is crucial hillary's spokesman specifically denied that she had ever
[02:46:42.720 --> 02:46:48.480]  met with or spoken with the billionaire ukrainian victor pin chuck we now know through the leaked
[02:46:48.480 --> 02:46:53.440]  emails that she met with him on at least three occasions she is a excuse my friends and christian
[02:46:53.440 --> 02:46:59.920]  stations i love god but she is a gd liar and we specifically know that he dined with her at her home
[02:46:59.920 --> 02:47:06.640]  in georgetown so so much for the notion that she had nothing to do with pin chuck pin chuck is the
[02:47:06.640 --> 02:47:12.080]  one who paid for the hit job on manifold the so-called ledger no you told me three months ago
[02:47:12.080 --> 02:47:16.880]  you said they got pi's all over they got this pin shut guy it's all bs but it doesn't matter
[02:47:16.880 --> 02:47:23.360]  because the new york times owned by the mexican kingpin of kingpins the number one funder of hillary
[02:47:24.160 --> 02:47:28.160]  puts it on page one above the fold but but but see that's the that's the paradox the new york
[02:47:28.160 --> 02:47:33.040]  times is now a joke even with liberals and this fellow macintire i think it's glenn macintire one
[02:47:33.040 --> 02:47:39.600]  of the one of the authors of that piece admits well men for may have done nothing wrong that's
[02:47:39.600 --> 02:47:44.080]  extraordinary this was a hit piece without foundation it's yellow journalism out dare man
[02:47:44.080 --> 02:47:47.760]  afford though this is his business your business go around the world and be part of democratic
[02:47:47.760 --> 02:47:52.880]  elections yeah exactly i mean went and i got somebody elected and then all hillary did was get
[02:47:52.880 --> 02:47:56.960]  five billion dollars the state department money with george soros and go run around shooting police
[02:47:56.960 --> 02:48:01.920]  and causing riots same things for us is doing here and causing a destabilization over by the
[02:48:01.920 --> 02:48:07.840]  government oh that's so sweet that's so nice yeah no it's extraordinary and i guess here is the
[02:48:07.840 --> 02:48:14.160]  the real irony is to the extent that there's been ukrainian interference in our elections
[02:48:14.160 --> 02:48:20.240]  it's by the clintonites i mean this the clintons are using ukrainians interfere their whole foundation
[02:48:20.240 --> 02:48:24.800]  is a multinational takeover america speak of the devil we've been complaining for almost three weeks
[02:48:24.800 --> 02:48:29.360]  david night and i that no coverage in the us press other than the real media like info wars and drudge
[02:48:29.360 --> 02:48:33.600]  and you know world that daily places like that right bar no coverage of george soros the nazi
[02:48:33.600 --> 02:48:39.520]  collaborator who's overthrown scores of government's crash economies but the jerusalem post and even
[02:48:39.520 --> 02:48:44.720]  some european press our world soros's campaign of global chaos when you're getting attacked this is
[02:48:44.720 --> 02:48:50.080]  him as you know yes and the first thing that we see is a megalomaniacal nature of soros's
[02:48:50.080 --> 02:48:55.360]  philanthropic project no corner of the globe is unaffected by his efforts no policy area is left
[02:48:55.360 --> 02:49:02.240]  untouched and the article goes on to admit he is like the return of hitler so thank god somebody's
[02:49:02.240 --> 02:49:06.320]  looking at these emails and so there's that thing they can cover this up but not forever well and
[02:49:06.320 --> 02:49:12.400]  george soros is the major funder of the front group media matters america for america and
[02:49:12.400 --> 02:49:17.600]  correct the record which should be called distort the record and all they do is attack us personally
[02:49:17.600 --> 02:49:23.360]  because they cannot refute our arguments yeah he is the enemy uh and that who yeah that's who
[02:49:23.360 --> 02:49:29.120]  must be defeated but when the jerusalem post is coming out against soros i mean he's the world
[02:49:29.120 --> 02:49:34.080]  the whole from the russians to our own intelligence agencies to the israelis now he better be watching
[02:49:34.080 --> 02:49:39.520]  it well uh they know mi6 doesn't like him no they know he was a nazi collaborator historically
[02:49:39.520 --> 02:49:44.640]  he's certainly no friend of the jewish people so i'm delighted to see the jewsland post uh well i
[02:49:44.640 --> 02:49:49.840]  mean i think this this is a bellwether that he's he's pretty much done well we shall see this is
[02:49:49.840 --> 02:49:54.560]  going to be a horrific fight because they have the mainstream media on their side and all we have is
[02:49:54.560 --> 02:50:01.600]  the american people uh and down trump's abilities as a communicator roger stones our guest it is so
[02:50:01.600 --> 02:50:07.760]  despicable that he gets no big pharma money no big bank money no big globalist money no
[02:50:07.760 --> 02:50:13.520]  monsanto money he's preaching classic populism they just distort what he says then when he comes out

[02:53:03.520 --> 02:53:08.000]  he also discovered how normal cells turn into tumor cells he discovered the one prime cause of
[02:53:08.000 --> 02:53:13.440]  cancer was cellular oxygen deficiency dr joanna budwig built upon the work of dr warburg and
[02:53:13.440 --> 02:53:18.000]  discovered how to feed the cells to overcome this oxygen deficiency she found that it was a
[02:53:18.000 --> 02:53:22.320]  sulfur in the cottage cheese that would mix with fresh pressed flax oil that the flax oil would
[02:53:22.320 --> 02:53:27.120]  become emulsified and more readily absorbed flax oil delivered in this manner was able to restore
[02:53:27.120 --> 02:53:32.080]  oxygen transfer to all cells of the body now there's a new method of pressing seed oils that
[02:53:32.080 --> 02:53:37.040]  produces the highest quality zero oxidation undamaged seed oils the results on these seed

[02:54:58.400 --> 02:55:07.760]  roger stone now now for me what is a big deal here is that in america the white house run media
[02:55:07.760 --> 02:55:11.120]  matters who got him banned off all these other channels says banning and now they're saying
[02:55:11.120 --> 02:55:16.480]  van breitbart and drudge again a lot of morons who are libertarians or conservatives there's

[02:56:30.560 --> 02:56:36.960]  and when you take action and realize just like electricity you know you're getting a circuit
[02:56:36.960 --> 02:56:42.400]  and passing through when you take action that's what sends the thunderbolts and lightning bolts
[02:56:42.400 --> 02:56:48.400]  down the line straight into hillary's big fat diaper ass well i'm gonna say this the schedule
[02:56:48.400 --> 02:56:52.640]  that i'm keeping alex i gotta tell you i could not do without popping a couple of brain forces
[02:56:52.640 --> 02:56:57.520]  when i get up in the morning brain force keeps you moving now they'll they'll attack us for this
[02:56:57.520 --> 02:57:02.720]  too because we believe in alternative medicine because we believe has been done for centuries
[02:57:02.720 --> 02:57:07.760]  that herbs and supplements work that makes us kooky there's something nutty about us this product
[02:57:07.760 --> 02:57:13.200]  works i use it every day i could not keep the schedule that i keep working for freedom working
[02:57:13.200 --> 02:57:18.080]  for down trump if i didn't have brain force until the germans came out with synthetic drugs 160 years
[02:57:18.080 --> 02:57:23.520]  ago or so apothecaries were the drug store he had doctors there and apothecaries but everything was
[02:57:23.520 --> 02:57:28.880]  our herbs or natural compounds chinese medicine is 3 000 years old western medicine is roughly
[02:57:28.880 --> 02:57:34.880]  150 years old please give me a break exactly but they will they'll depict us as kooky because we
[02:57:34.880 --> 02:57:39.600]  believe in alternatives to western medicine so look get your brain force is a great product
[02:57:39.600 --> 02:57:43.920]  i can't remember the best we could for a low price i mean it really is good i appreciate your plug
[02:57:43.920 --> 02:57:48.080]  and that's how we're funding ourselves roger selling books you know myself selling hillary for
[02:57:48.080 --> 02:57:54.160]  president shards but but beyond that it's not about that we're in a total war roger absolutely
[02:57:54.160 --> 02:57:57.120]  let me make a little guess you could have easily over the years been hired by the other side
[02:57:57.120 --> 02:58:01.440]  oh i've had offers they've tried to buy me off the russians themselves actually approached me
[02:58:01.440 --> 02:58:05.200]  when i was working for reagan and they told me they could really enhance my lifestyle if i would
[02:58:05.200 --> 02:58:10.960]  just go to work for them you know what i did i took it right to the fbi now i could easily have
[02:58:10.960 --> 02:58:17.760]  switched sides george bush tried to hire me for his 1988 campaign not interested so uh look i think
[02:58:17.760 --> 02:58:23.440]  we're the real value is being genuine well i've you know i came to believe certain things for a
[02:58:23.440 --> 02:58:29.440]  lot of times i was kind of a blind right of center mainstream republican and then i began to see the
[02:58:29.440 --> 02:58:34.800]  criminality of the bushes the lies that got us into the iraq war it was time to become even

[03:00:09.200 --> 03:00:14.480]  i have a famous c-span interview he did from new york last week that the white house once banned
[03:00:14.480 --> 03:00:17.760]  and i can't believe that and that's what media matters is when they want to ban them yes on
[03:00:17.760 --> 03:00:25.840]  their side they say it and it's right here news makers with roger stone and you're on for 30 minutes
[03:00:25.840 --> 03:00:29.920]  and i asked what did you cover and of course it was election fraud yeah i know this this whole
[03:00:29.920 --> 03:00:34.800]  narrative drives them crazy because it's true so i cited the stanford study i cite that the
[03:00:34.800 --> 03:00:40.960]  princeton professor uh dr fatrakis the the ohio professor uh and i made a comprehensive case it
[03:00:40.960 --> 03:00:46.800]  was a very contentious interview monica langley of the wall street journal was on she was perfectly
[03:00:46.800 --> 03:00:53.040]  fair but she gave as good as she got uh but you see they can't stand alternative ideas they can't
[03:00:53.040 --> 03:00:58.640]  stand anybody else's narrative liberals love free speech as long as it's their free speech so they're
[03:00:58.640 --> 03:01:02.560]  running they've been running a monopoly for a long time they've just now figured out no one's
[03:01:02.560 --> 03:01:07.920]  listening to them and so now they want to shut us down exactly exactly but i think we're winning
[03:01:07.920 --> 03:01:14.400]  let me give you an example i wrote for bright bart over a month ago to what i believe to be
[03:01:14.400 --> 03:01:20.320]  seminal pieces on huma abadi connecting her to the world muslim league connecting her to the
[03:01:20.320 --> 03:01:24.480]  institute for minority muslim affair and now it's the biggest story in the country exactly
[03:01:24.480 --> 03:01:30.240]  finally a month later you have mainstream media outlets some of them beginning to cover well
[03:01:30.240 --> 03:01:35.760]  roger the media calls you this evil nasty galactic super liar and then you're like the most accurate
[03:01:35.760 --> 03:01:39.360]  person i've probably ever had on air well i i appreciate that i'm serious though well i guess
[03:01:39.360 --> 03:01:44.400]  that just an inversion of reality it's character assassination they attack me because they're afraid
[03:01:44.400 --> 03:01:50.480]  of me you know you can call me anything you want the only title i really prefer is effective i like
[03:01:50.480 --> 03:01:56.720]  to be effective on behalf of my ideals my candidates and my principles and i think i'm being attacked
[03:01:56.720 --> 03:02:01.440]  because i have those incredible she openly writes for a journal that says support suppress muslim
[03:02:01.440 --> 03:02:06.400]  women she's openly hooked into these islamic uh you know jihadi groups she's got classified
[03:02:06.400 --> 03:02:10.800]  material in the front of her car everything you said about her as best we can tell what she's a
[03:02:10.800 --> 03:02:15.600]  saudi royal agent i i think she's a saudi asset look she they the media keeps saying
[03:02:15.600 --> 03:02:22.400]  her mother's a prominent feminist no her mother's a prominent advocate for genital mutilation she
[03:02:22.400 --> 03:02:27.840]  has written because that's the question did about genital mutilation umma have her genitals called
[03:02:27.840 --> 03:02:32.560]  i i i that i cannot tell you but what i can tell you is i mean it's fair i don't mean that to be
[03:02:32.560 --> 03:02:38.160]  grass she worked for an organ that blamed the united states for the attack on 9 11 she was
[03:02:38.160 --> 03:02:43.840]  working for a journalist that said that editorially uh where does she come from how does she show up in
[03:02:43.840 --> 03:02:50.320]  washington and tell the washingtonian years before she's even met the clinton's that she has a handbag
[03:02:50.320 --> 03:02:56.560]  for every day of the week and each handbag is 1500 dollars her parents are poor clerics pardon
[03:02:56.560 --> 03:03:03.440]  me poor academics back in saudi she's got all the trappings of an agent exactly the wealth
[03:03:03.440 --> 03:03:08.160]  that she dresses the part where's this money coming from now once she met the clinton's
[03:03:08.160 --> 03:03:14.480]  and she got an unprecedented uh a deal where she has a threefer she has a special waiver that allowed
[03:03:14.480 --> 03:03:19.760]  her to make money as a full-time employee of the state department while she was double dipping at
[03:03:19.760 --> 03:03:25.120]  the clinton foundation and triple dipping at tenet but then you're also not supposed to criticize
[03:03:25.120 --> 03:03:31.760]  chelsea a webster hubbell's daughter uh because she gets six million six six million dollars a year
[03:03:31.760 --> 03:03:36.640]  to run the money laundering operation the clinton foundation poor chelsea says she tried to care
[03:03:36.640 --> 03:03:42.240]  about money she just can't i lived in a 10.5 million dollar apartment in manhattan new york
[03:03:42.240 --> 03:03:48.320]  i probably wouldn't care about that or maybe a 10 million dollar apartment and a lot those plastic
[03:03:48.320 --> 03:03:52.640]  surgeries they're very expensive so you gotta still look like mr redd i'm not trying to be main
[03:03:52.640 --> 03:03:59.440]  but no she looks like her father webster hubbell who looks like a carton mr redd yes good point
[03:03:59.440 --> 03:04:05.040]  now now now expanding she's the daughter of mr redd she's she's the daughter of webster hubbell
[03:04:05.040 --> 03:04:10.240]  the former law partner of uh of hillary clinton the horse is a horse of course of course of course
[03:04:10.240 --> 03:04:15.520]  the former deputy attorney general the guy who hillary called to say launch the assault at
[03:04:15.520 --> 03:04:21.520]  waco as i establish in my book uh both senator arland specter's investigation in the us senate
[03:04:21.520 --> 03:04:27.760]  and t march bell the chief investigator for the house committee on waco both concluded hillary gave
[03:04:27.760 --> 03:04:33.840]  the order co-president hillary gave the order that killed well i gotta say i hadn't even thought of
[03:04:33.840 --> 03:04:38.960]  you whenever you talked about umabity but that's all come out to be documented what you first broke
[03:04:38.960 --> 03:04:43.360]  that and you also talked about watch the watchers watch the justice department sends in and now

[03:08:29.120 --> 03:08:32.160]  all right we're riding shotgun with paul watson and taking phone calls at least
[03:08:32.160 --> 03:08:37.600]  for the first 30 minutes and watson uh we'll be taking over uh paul don't run away we're about
[03:08:37.600 --> 03:08:45.280]  to go right to you my friend uh but roger stone is my guest here in studio uh he's been in dallas
[03:08:45.280 --> 03:08:50.080]  speaking to a capacity crowd of the book signing he was just on c span last week and the white house
[03:08:50.080 --> 03:08:55.920]  is trying to censor that i mean it's otherworldly when you go to media matters again run by the
[03:08:55.920 --> 03:09:01.600]  white house on record and they're saying don't have roger stone on msnbc don't have roger stone
[03:09:01.600 --> 03:09:09.200]  on cnn and they say on air one day later roger stone is now banned and then we know they say he
[03:09:09.200 --> 03:09:14.240]  should be banned on fox and he hadn't been on since then and then they come out and say
[03:09:15.200 --> 03:09:20.080]  conservative media that's independent has no right to exist we're going to start with breitbart
[03:09:20.080 --> 03:09:24.000]  the fact that we ever play that clip did we find that clip of drudge saying a year ago
[03:09:24.000 --> 03:09:27.360]  when he came here they're coming out of the press let's let's cue that up at a moment
[03:09:27.360 --> 03:09:32.560]  and then we're gonna go to calls but paul watson when you hosted uh the show last week uh i think
[03:09:32.560 --> 03:09:37.600]  it was friday you really hammered this and i keep going back to this i mean everyone
[03:09:37.600 --> 03:09:42.720]  should be against the democrats right now i didn't like bush because of his police state garbage
[03:09:42.720 --> 03:09:47.520]  but just like jonathan turtley the liberal constitutional law professor said obama's been
[03:09:47.520 --> 03:09:53.280]  three times worse that was a few years ago how about ten times worse now because if if they were
[03:09:53.280 --> 03:09:57.920]  arresting michael more for his movie like they did denisha susan i would stand up for michael more
[03:09:57.920 --> 03:10:02.480]  i mean i'm not a republican or democrat i'm a libertarian patriot but man i gotta tell you the
[03:10:02.480 --> 03:10:11.200]  democrats are so corrupt now paul and so open about their corruption is this a disconnect
[03:10:11.920 --> 03:10:16.000]  i mean i think more and more it is a disconnect or what do they know we don't know i mean why
[03:10:16.000 --> 03:10:21.760]  didn't obama show up for six days to new orleans when they criticize bush for doing that or why
[03:10:21.760 --> 03:10:28.160]  didn't hillary even show up i mean it just seems like almost entertaining if it wasn't so real
[03:10:28.160 --> 03:10:33.040]  paul watson what do you think's happening well i think they're just they're authoritarians now
[03:10:33.040 --> 03:10:38.880]  they're coming out in the open with it alex i mean we've got google and we know this we knew this
[03:10:38.880 --> 03:10:44.000]  back in june that they were already hiding certain search results for hillary clinton when you type
[03:10:44.000 --> 03:10:50.240]  in hillary clinton cri hillary clinton crimes don't come up it's something about hillary clinton
[03:10:50.240 --> 03:10:56.160]  you know cri whatever you're typing hillary clinton indy for indictment it comes up hillary
[03:10:56.160 --> 03:11:02.880]  clinton india and now we had the article yesterday google hides clinton body count search suggestions
[03:11:02.880 --> 03:11:09.360]  you go on any other search engine bing yahoo search whatever you type in clinton body and
[03:11:09.360 --> 03:11:15.120]  then immediately a list of information links about the clinton body count comes up you do it on google
[03:11:15.120 --> 03:11:21.760]  dot com let's do it doesn't happen what you get is clinton body shop these obscure auto repair shops
[03:11:21.760 --> 03:11:27.920]  in you know midwestern america or or whatever nothing whatsoever no search suggestion for
[03:11:27.920 --> 03:11:35.440]  clinton body count and in a digital world they can disappear you anytime they want this is
[03:11:36.080 --> 03:11:43.680]  unprecedented paul how could any real liberal in the classic thomas jeverson sense how could they not
[03:11:43.680 --> 03:11:52.080]  openly support trump at this point this is such an endorsement of him uh the fact he gets no big
[03:11:52.080 --> 03:12:00.000]  money this is what we've been waiting for paul it's because they do absolutely no research they
[03:12:00.000 --> 03:12:04.640]  do no reading they swallow what they're fed by the mainstream media i mean they're just fake
[03:12:04.640 --> 03:12:09.200]  intellectual thoughts with fake colored socks walking around saying how intellectual they are
[03:12:09.200 --> 03:12:15.280]  right yeah and they're taught this inevitability that hillary clinton's gonna win well you look
[03:12:15.280 --> 03:12:20.880]  at the polls you look at the bloomberg poll the reuters poll they've got a system where they go in
[03:12:20.880 --> 03:12:26.000]  and say they take people who say they're not voting for either trump or clinton then they pressure
[03:12:26.000 --> 03:12:30.400]  them and say well who would you vote for if you did vote for for someone would it be clinton would
[03:12:30.400 --> 03:12:35.120]  it be hillary would it be hillary so then they add the people in who say they're not gonna vote
[03:12:35.120 --> 03:12:41.440]  in the clinton bracket that's why she's winning all these polls they also go in and change they
[03:12:41.440 --> 03:12:47.200]  manipulate they amend the results they weigh the sample in favor of democrats so they over
[03:12:47.200 --> 03:12:52.000]  sample democrats in these polls again and again and again so of course hillary clinton is gonna
[03:12:52.000 --> 03:12:58.080]  come out on top when you get a more even sampling of republicans and democrats then normally trump
[03:12:58.080 --> 03:13:04.000]  comes out on top so they're faking they're rigging these polls to make it seem like hillary clinton
[03:13:04.000 --> 03:13:10.560]  is inevitable to take the white house even with that you've got a upi poll out today which shows
[03:13:10.560 --> 03:13:16.000]  there's one point in it so even though they're rigging the polls for hillary trump is still
[03:13:16.000 --> 03:13:21.120]  on an even keel in LA times he's got a scientific poll that shows you my head by a point uh i want
[03:13:21.120 --> 03:13:26.240]  to go to phone calls ride shotgun poll jump at any time you know this is a uh you know three hosts
[03:13:26.240 --> 03:13:31.600]  here in the callers of a roger stone you're chomping at the bit well what paul says is absolutely true
[03:13:31.600 --> 03:13:38.240]  look uh i uh i have an ego i look myself up on google on the way here the first seven stories are
[03:13:38.240 --> 03:13:43.680]  all manufactured by the clinton thugs all the negative stuff is at the top all the all the
[03:13:43.680 --> 03:13:48.400]  positive stuff that i've done here all of the uh free expression stuff we done it's all moved to
[03:13:48.400 --> 03:13:55.040]  the bottom yeah it's it's an entirely rigged system uh we live uh now with a fake reality of
[03:13:55.040 --> 03:14:00.160]  rigged polls and rigged elections these people are incredible authoritarians but i'll tell you
[03:14:00.160 --> 03:14:04.320]  this only makes me double down to know i've always been right and then i'm never going to give up
[03:14:04.320 --> 03:14:09.600]  roger what does it do for you i mean we really now know our worst fears were accurate i just got
[03:14:09.600 --> 03:14:15.040]  chills no i think that's holy terror these people that that's absolutely right uh paul did a terrific
[03:14:15.040 --> 03:14:22.240]  piece on hillary's health uh yesterday i was asked uh by uh fernando umandi who's a terrific and
[03:14:22.240 --> 03:14:29.440]  incredibly fair but democratic uh talk show host in miami would i be satisfied if the clinton's
[03:14:29.440 --> 03:14:35.920]  just released a letter from her doctor uh in her medical records i reminded him that dr janet travel
[03:14:36.480 --> 03:14:42.000]  the doctor for president john f kennedy released a letter saying he did not have addison's just
[03:14:42.000 --> 03:14:47.040]  before the election putting the health questions that linden johnson had been spreading to bed
[03:14:47.600 --> 03:14:54.400]  later when we saw his autopsy we learned that he was in the latter stages of addison's disease no
[03:14:54.400 --> 03:14:58.880]  nothing the clinton say about her health will be true well let me ask you this then from all the
[03:14:58.880 --> 03:15:03.280]  good sources and now we have wiki leaks that she's was trying to get uh parkerson's medication
[03:15:03.840 --> 03:15:08.400]  and that she quote couldn't get up if she laid down and quote was falling down and quote all
[03:15:08.400 --> 03:15:12.640]  these neurologists are going look i'm a democrat but this woman's got problems she had decision
[03:15:12.640 --> 03:15:18.320]  fatigue what is the best thinking in your own intel on what's really wrong with her uh look i have
[03:15:18.320 --> 03:15:23.840]  no anything beyond my own observations the real question would be what happens if she kicks the
[03:15:23.840 --> 03:15:29.440]  bucket before the election which looks to me to be entirely possible do they go to uncle joe biden
[03:15:29.440 --> 03:15:34.080]  who can't seem to keep his hands off of hillary and any woman that he meets and particularly
[03:15:34.080 --> 03:15:40.880]  younger girls or do we or do we give the nomination to uh to uh uh senator kane who seems to be the
[03:15:40.880 --> 03:15:46.080]  handpicked successor this guy's got to be licking his chops he sees her he's got to see she's she's
[03:15:46.080 --> 03:15:51.280]  on her last legs he's looking at becoming president by default by riding in with her
[03:15:51.280 --> 03:15:57.920]  so uh but uh the the whole question of her health is a perfectly legitimate issue
[03:15:58.480 --> 03:16:03.280]  that they just don't want to confront so they have to call us names what about the stupid pickle
[03:16:03.280 --> 03:16:08.640]  thing clearly the pickle top doesn't pop off she just turns it you see the stupid yeah what does
[03:16:08.640 --> 03:16:15.840]  this prove let her run to 10k and then i'll believe she's in good health hard to 5k i got
[03:16:15.840 --> 03:16:18.960]  four containers of pickles in here and one of them was so tight i was having trouble getting
[03:16:18.960 --> 03:16:23.600]  it off i mean this woman you obviously shouldn't be president then absolutely that makes it clear
[03:16:23.600 --> 03:16:27.760]  i need a you know knife to be hitting the top of it uh i want to take a few phone calls here
[03:16:27.760 --> 03:16:32.160]  we're skipping this network break andrea we're going to go to you in a moment john in california
[03:16:33.040 --> 03:16:39.840]  we're going to go to chris um we're going to go to owl killer and anthony uh we've got uh
[03:16:39.840 --> 03:16:45.360]  chris is a black american upset with alex jumps and and that sounds like an interesting phone
[03:16:45.360 --> 03:16:50.400]  call but i'm going to go to andrea first in the great state of texas uh since she's kind of on
[03:16:50.400 --> 03:16:54.640]  the general topic go ahead andrea you're on the air with roger stone and paul watson
[03:16:56.480 --> 03:17:02.880]  hello alex nice to say hi to you again um you bet thank you for calling so before that i hope you
[03:17:02.880 --> 03:17:09.600]  sort of remember me i was the mother that spoke about montanto and the kids without him absolutely
[03:17:09.600 --> 03:17:16.720]  i remember calling us a while ago okay well uh i want people to know also that i'm a latin american
[03:17:16.720 --> 03:17:22.800]  citizen so my background is hispanic and i'm a middle upper class of course i'm a hardworking
[03:17:22.800 --> 03:17:27.920]  person and i support donald trump so when the democrats are saying that donald trump doesn't
[03:17:27.920 --> 03:17:36.320]  have a latino support is a utterly bullshit everybody here in uh houston area galveston area
[03:17:36.320 --> 03:17:42.560]  that are middle class latinos hispanic that has jobs that hire people uh we support donald trump
[03:17:42.560 --> 03:17:49.920]  because we are uh majority republicans we also believe in uh you know as a libertarian we believe
[03:17:49.920 --> 03:17:56.320]  in the in in the hardworking not in the handout and well sure i mean look if you look at communism
[03:17:56.320 --> 03:18:00.160]  and socialism it's not compatible with the great work ethic i've seen from you know people that
[03:18:00.160 --> 03:18:03.840]  are south of the united states on average i don't want to be cliched but i mean it's it's it's been
[03:18:03.840 --> 03:18:10.160]  observed but if you look at this what are the hidden numbers of people that have been bullied
[03:18:10.800 --> 03:18:15.120]  into being closeted trump supporters i mean a lot of people called me in fact mainstream media i
[03:18:15.120 --> 03:18:20.000]  probably had let's not exaggerate more than 15 newspapers call my cell phone to just know it
[03:18:20.000 --> 03:18:24.640]  in the last week going oh you're guys flip-flopping on immigration how do you feel and i remember
[03:18:24.640 --> 03:18:28.080]  his full clips a year ago that i played and i want to speak to this right now with roger shone and
[03:18:28.080 --> 03:18:32.080]  ball Watson where he'd say i love people i love people from all over the country all over the
[03:18:32.080 --> 03:18:36.960]  world we need you but if you're a felon and you're coming here to get stuff free and you're doing all
[03:18:36.960 --> 03:18:41.680]  this blah blah blah you know we're going to deport you blah blah blah well they just cut it to we're
[03:18:41.680 --> 03:18:46.000]  going to deport you and that turned into i hate mexicans they're all criminals and now they're
[03:18:46.000 --> 03:18:50.480]  saying you flip-flop he always said i hire a lot of immigrants they're great people we're going to
[03:18:50.480 --> 03:18:54.320]  make sure you're good we're going to make sure you're vetted we're going to make it quick we're
[03:18:54.320 --> 03:18:58.320]  going to make it simple but you're going to be vetted that's not flip-flopping that's not
[03:18:58.320 --> 03:19:04.480]  we've got 35 or 40 million people here most of them felons do whatever they want and we're just now
[03:19:04.480 --> 03:19:09.200]  going to just flip a switch and say you're all legal and screw all the people that came here
[03:19:09.200 --> 03:19:15.120]  legally trump's going to make it easier to come here legally that's what we need we need good people
[03:19:15.120 --> 03:19:20.000]  here we killed most our kids in america no matter what color we were we made that decision good bring
[03:19:20.000 --> 03:19:24.720]  them in from latin america don't bring them in from suny countries i'm done go ahead i think that's
[03:19:24.720 --> 03:19:30.800]  exactly right we saw the same thing when trump said he favored a temporary ban on muslim immigration
[03:19:30.800 --> 03:19:36.640]  on cnn that became a ban on muslim immigration and then of course several of the republican
[03:19:36.640 --> 03:19:41.760]  candidates come out and said well that's unconstitutional which it most definitely is not
[03:19:41.760 --> 03:19:47.200]  so it's the same smear tactic uh donald trump has not changed his position we didn't flip-flop
[03:19:47.200 --> 03:19:52.240]  they're they're now just showing the full quote and the fact that trump insists that the immigration
[03:19:52.240 --> 03:19:58.400]  service should be allowed to look at the social media postings of those who apply to come here
[03:19:58.400 --> 03:20:03.360]  no if you're saying on your facebook they look at my social media when i fly in so if they want to
[03:20:03.360 --> 03:20:08.960]  if someone is saying on their facebook page ali akbar deaths to all the jews i don't want that
[03:20:08.960 --> 03:20:14.400]  person in the united states and either does donald trump let me ask paul watch them that question
[03:20:14.400 --> 03:20:18.240]  since you brought that up look i've got issues with israel but there's this idiotic thing like i
[03:20:18.240 --> 03:20:21.680]  have issues with america i have issues with the cops i mean i want to shoot him in the back of the
[03:20:21.680 --> 03:20:28.400]  head it's a diverse situation soros emails come out where he wants to overthrow the us overthrow
[03:20:28.400 --> 03:20:34.480]  europe overthrow israel for the muslims and this is a whole liberal cause the lab regardless what
[03:20:34.480 --> 03:20:38.720]  you think about stuff happening in israel there's bad problems on both sides israel's got seven or
[03:20:38.720 --> 03:20:44.800]  eight parties it's a diverse group of people and now even the jewsland post comes out and says our
[03:20:44.800 --> 03:20:51.040]  world soros campaign of global chaos the fact that his emails are coming out even the jewsland
[03:20:51.040 --> 03:20:58.480]  post is calling him a dangerous megalomaniac who thinks he's god soros said in interviews he believes
[03:20:58.480 --> 03:21:05.840]  he's the messiah what the hell is this crazy nazi collaborator doing uh paul watchen do you
[03:21:05.840 --> 03:21:11.440]  think soros has gone too far i mean is he like milk that finally got rotten in the in the grocery
[03:21:11.440 --> 03:21:17.040]  store cooler i mean does this guy just go on forever well i mean he's definitely one of the
[03:21:17.040 --> 03:21:22.480]  biggest skeletons in hillary's closet the media didn't touch those leaked emails they didn't touch
[03:21:22.480 --> 03:21:26.960]  him they haven't talked about him there are explosive revelations in there i think that
[03:21:26.960 --> 03:21:32.800]  are yet to be revealed with the ideological test the immigration thing you know trump came out and
[03:21:32.800 --> 03:21:39.520]  said we want people here who respect lgbt rights respect women respect gays you would think that
[03:21:39.520 --> 03:21:46.000]  the left would be cheering and celebrating that well no sally cone of cnn says that sharia law
[03:21:46.000 --> 03:21:51.920]  is progressive now you look at the characteristics of sharia law alex wife beating cut women's
[03:21:51.920 --> 03:21:58.480]  genitals are still gays child marriage you know female genital mutilation that's progressive
[03:21:58.480 --> 03:22:03.760]  according to the left because again they're not liberals their regressive leftist their
[03:22:03.760 --> 03:22:10.560]  authoritarians and why are they in love with the most radical sunni weirdos well because they share
[03:22:10.560 --> 03:22:15.280]  the same end goal which is the complete destruction of america i've said that over and over again
[03:22:15.280 --> 03:22:20.480]  but you know the emails that that's what soros is planning and you say is her biggest plot her
[03:22:20.480 --> 03:22:26.160]  biggest skeleton in the closet he's running things these emails show no one more than soros
[03:22:26.160 --> 03:22:31.600]  is quarterbacking things he's the first string quarterback no they show you can look at the
[03:22:31.600 --> 03:22:37.680]  black lives matter funding and it says directly this is to destroy the current system as it stands
[03:22:37.680 --> 03:22:42.240]  and this is you know what they had the agenda has been all along with political correctness
[03:22:42.240 --> 03:22:47.600]  with uh marxism is not is to overthrow the entire system and that's what it says in the
[03:22:47.600 --> 03:22:52.160]  black lives matter soros documents that's why he's funding black lives matter that's why
[03:22:52.160 --> 03:22:56.800]  the mainstream media is encouraging these riots but you can even look at the polls with the immigration
[03:22:56.800 --> 03:23:04.080]  issue six out of ten immigrants support donald trump's ideological test so to say it's racist
[03:23:04.080 --> 03:23:08.720]  and bigoted again they can't sell that anymore because the polls have completely disproven them
[03:23:08.720 --> 03:23:14.000]  but sharia law is progressive now chopping people's hands off beating women that's progressive
[03:23:14.000 --> 03:23:19.840]  according to the saying and then they call us bigots uh andrea in texas other comments how many
[03:23:19.840 --> 03:23:24.880]  other latino people that you talk to just on average dead reckoning are really supportive of
[03:23:24.880 --> 03:23:28.480]  trump but scared to say it or what percentage of latinos do you think really support trump
[03:23:30.080 --> 03:23:35.840]  it's a huge number that uh alex but they keep it to themselves because there is a lot of bully
[03:23:35.840 --> 03:23:43.520]  also going on and but what is amazing is that everybody i asked uh even in california because
[03:23:43.520 --> 03:23:50.000]  i'm originally from california and all my family's friends people that work for big companies everybody
[03:23:50.000 --> 03:23:55.600]  that is a latin americans citizen which we should make a difference between the people outside making
[03:23:55.600 --> 03:24:00.640]  riots and stuff those are illegals that they don't even vote so it's irrelevant you can see a hundred
[03:24:00.640 --> 03:24:06.240]  or two hundred of them is irrelevant they don't vote unless they do fraud but the legal americans
[03:24:06.240 --> 03:24:10.640]  hispanic background they are supporting from because we are sick and tired of the democrats
[03:24:11.200 --> 03:24:16.880]  tying us to the sky to bring people that are unskilled people and better people like the
[03:24:16.880 --> 03:24:21.200]  muslims like uh from all over the world absolutely in fact i want to point out everybody have
[03:24:21.200 --> 03:24:26.240]  sisters on mexicans all day that used to be the biggest group it for like three years it's chinese
[03:24:26.240 --> 03:24:30.240]  women are the biggest group and they come in to have their babies are free i'm not against asians
[03:24:30.240 --> 03:24:35.040]  my sister's adopted from a korean i love asians the point is i can't go to china and have babies
[03:24:35.040 --> 03:24:42.480]  for free i mean we're going bankrupt this is insane and it's a plan and the globalists are
[03:24:42.480 --> 03:24:48.720]  doing it to drive down our wages we want hardworking people with no criminal records america needs
[03:24:48.720 --> 03:24:53.120]  immigrants and trump has always said that trump has always been for that roger yeah i know it's
[03:24:53.120 --> 03:24:58.400]  interesting on the way here from dalis i returned a call from a washington post reporter who said
[03:24:58.400 --> 03:25:04.160]  that trump yesterday had made a blatant appeal for african-american votes and how did i square that
[03:25:04.160 --> 03:25:09.680]  with his past as a racist that was the question so i mean the point here is i was known to be a
[03:25:09.680 --> 03:25:15.360]  massive hire of african well not only that but it was bill clinton who passed the 1994 crime bill
[03:25:15.360 --> 03:25:21.520]  which has incarcerated an entire generation of young black men for nonviolent crimes such as the
[03:25:21.520 --> 03:25:28.240]  possession of small amounts of drugs and in the clinton bill the penalties for rock cocaine
[03:25:28.240 --> 03:25:34.240]  are much more harsh than the penalties for powdered that'd be like that'd be like new stereotypical
[03:25:34.240 --> 03:25:40.880]  that'd be like the the five times more for malt liquor than bud light so in this particular case
[03:25:40.880 --> 03:25:45.040]  because white shrink bud light on average blacks would drink malt liquor yes it's the same it's
[03:25:45.040 --> 03:25:50.960]  incredible and as you know hillary clinton said that the 1994 bill which has destroyed an entire
[03:25:50.960 --> 03:25:55.840]  generation of young black men was necessary because black by the way i drink malt liquor
[03:25:55.840 --> 03:26:01.120]  super predators who must be brought to heal by the way i like malt liquor over regular i do too
[03:26:01.760 --> 03:26:06.080]  that's why we're racist we're racist obviously i like fried chicken too i do too but that doesn't
[03:26:06.080 --> 03:26:10.720]  make us racist no but i was i would see these things like they're racist they serve fried
[03:26:10.720 --> 03:26:14.560]  chicken like clinton is a racist or at least a race pamphlet he's the one who went to federal
[03:26:14.560 --> 03:26:20.000]  court to argue for uh racial profiling by the media called him racist when he served black
[03:26:20.000 --> 03:26:24.320]  people chicken that's not right everybody likes chicken let's just remember it was bill clinton
[03:26:24.320 --> 03:26:29.600]  who said to ted kennedy about barack obama you know ten a few years ago this boy would be fetching
[03:26:29.600 --> 03:26:36.480]  our coffee there's your dog whistle politics right there i know i'm gonna be honest because i mean
[03:26:36.480 --> 03:26:42.560]  i grew up in a republican family of like christians who were all beat ourselves in the back for being
[03:26:42.560 --> 03:26:47.200]  evil racist and america has to atone it's like the republicans were the original kind of liberal
[03:26:47.200 --> 03:26:51.680]  political correct people but then i would get around democrats and it was once i got political
[03:26:51.680 --> 03:26:56.880]  and these people are racist and i mean including black people it's like black racist against black
[03:26:56.880 --> 03:27:01.120]  people and i've had black leaders on they go oh you didn't know that oh yeah it's completely
[03:27:01.120 --> 03:27:06.080]  funny look the nineteen every landmark civil rights bill in the sixties passed only with
[03:27:06.080 --> 03:27:10.000]  the votes of republicans because the southern democrats wouldn't vote for them they wasn't
[03:27:10.000 --> 03:27:14.720]  lincoln a democrat where lincoln was a republican but the democrat no that's a party of the clan
[03:27:14.720 --> 03:27:20.240]  no no no he was a democrat yeah well i i'm a complete i'm a conspiracy realist they are the
[03:27:20.240 --> 03:27:25.680]  racists that matter i'm a clock conspiracy theorist he was a democrat and you know dinesh
[03:27:25.680 --> 03:27:31.520]  desuza's uh movie covers this very very well it is one of the best things in the movie is the history
[03:27:31.520 --> 03:27:36.160]  of the democratic party and racism they're the party of the races but they really are we're the
[03:27:36.160 --> 03:27:40.560]  party of civil rights but they really are that is our birthright now we may have wandered from it
[03:27:40.560 --> 03:27:45.040]  but it's time to get back to it you know what black people want the black people i talked to and i
[03:27:45.040 --> 03:27:49.840]  talked quite a few you know what they want they want a job they want a pc american pie
[03:27:49.840 --> 03:27:54.080]  they don't want to be employees they want to be employers they want to move up the ladder
[03:27:54.080 --> 03:27:58.800]  that's not happened under uh bill clinton it's not happened and they rock the criminals in the
[03:27:58.800 --> 03:28:03.920]  neighborhood arrested not tolerated well because black on black crime is their worst problem no so
[03:28:03.920 --> 03:28:09.920]  i think trump is the candidate of black opportunity can't trump is the candidate of black capitalism
[03:28:09.920 --> 03:28:15.600]  that's why by the way he's really into prosperity obama isn't saying elect me black people i'm
[03:28:15.600 --> 03:28:20.160]  going to help you trump is directly saying that what has employment among black people done under
[03:28:20.160 --> 03:28:26.000]  barack obama it's abysmal and as you know and as you know they deduct the people who are stopped
[03:28:26.000 --> 03:28:30.000]  working looking for what the rolls from the count to make it look better and it's still
[03:28:30.000 --> 03:28:33.600]  absolutely andrea we're going to continue on paul watson we're going to rise shock on a bit with
[03:28:33.600 --> 03:28:37.760]  you paul comes in does the show twice a week we should do it more he's so popular uh but then
[03:28:37.760 --> 03:28:40.640]  sometimes i go you know right over you don't mind if we continue on with you do you paul
[03:28:40.640 --> 03:28:46.880]  oh go ahead we're pirates we've taken over that you're battling the red coach battling the blue
[03:28:46.880 --> 03:28:54.960]  coach right now hi jack the other thing alex on on trump with black people he's going to get the
[03:28:54.960 --> 03:29:00.560]  most votes for a republican candidate from black people ever by the looks of it you look at pictures
[03:29:00.560 --> 03:29:06.000]  of trump you know almost every other picture is him with black public figures hugging them
[03:29:06.000 --> 03:29:12.480]  smiling with them why did trump only become a racist when he became a republican i mean this is a
[03:29:12.480 --> 03:29:17.440]  meme his entire history is being friends with black people hiring african-american listen
[03:29:17.440 --> 03:29:22.720]  i the right the right wing christians actually have a point on the whole advocate for gay people
[03:29:23.360 --> 03:29:28.160]  but but my issue is the media inverts it he's anti-gay which is absurd because he's the only
[03:29:28.160 --> 03:29:33.200]  one who will protect gays and lesbians from radical islamic maniacs who want to kill them
[03:29:33.200 --> 03:29:37.680]  30 years ago he was doing interviews with the advocate so they deserve equal rights yes indeed
[03:29:37.680 --> 03:29:41.920]  that's why he's anti-gay just like he's anti-black it's absurd just like he's anti-american no he's
[03:29:41.920 --> 03:29:47.200]  anti serial killers that have been deported four times coming back from shooting a young woman
[03:29:47.200 --> 03:29:55.760]  in san francisco we're on the march the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network
[03:29:55.760 --> 03:30:05.600]  in an unbelievable exchange with reporters state department spokesman mark toner admitted that
[03:30:05.600 --> 03:30:12.240]  he has no idea who picked up the 400 million dollars in cash that was put on a plane to iran
[03:30:12.240 --> 03:30:17.360]  toner claimed that the obama administration knows where the money went do you know who picked up the
[03:30:17.360 --> 03:30:23.840]  money asked associated press reporter bradley clapper i don't reply toner who'd you pay clapper
[03:30:23.840 --> 03:30:28.800]  asked i believe it was iranian officials and iranian government officials but i don't know
[03:30:28.800 --> 03:30:33.760]  particularly who individually it was toner said do you know which part of the iranian
[03:30:33.760 --> 03:30:39.680]  government you paid clapper asked i don't have that information no toner said does the administration
[03:30:39.680 --> 03:30:45.360]  know who paid it clapper asked i'm certain they would say yes toner answered and this isn't the
[03:30:45.360 --> 03:30:51.040]  first time the obama administration has acted on the honor system previously they had accidentally
[03:30:51.040 --> 03:30:57.200]  dropped a crate of explosives that was picked up by isis overseas you can find more reports on info

[03:36:19.520 --> 03:36:39.520]  All aboard Babylon
[03:36:39.520 --> 03:36:49.520]  All aboard Babylon
[03:36:49.520 --> 03:36:59.520]  All aboard Babylon
[03:36:59.520 --> 03:37:15.520]  All aboard Babylon
[03:37:15.520 --> 03:37:35.520]  All aboard Babylon
[03:37:35.520 --> 03:37:55.520]  All aboard Babylon
[03:37:55.520 --> 03:38:11.520]  They came out, they showed our articles without of course mentioning us by name, but they showed him for war's articles. They said that the Hillary health issue has been debunked and their sources for their evidence, their proof for it being debunked was Hillary Clinton says she's fine.
[03:38:11.520 --> 03:38:35.520]  In 2014, Bill Clinton said that Hillary was fine and Hillary's own internist personal physician says that she's fine. So you have three amazingly impartial independent sources there. Hillary's internist, Bill Clinton and Hillary herself, that was their evidence for saying that the whole controversy had been debunked.
[03:38:35.520 --> 03:38:43.520]  But wait, you see that that internist becomes the White House physician, which is of course a very coveted position. So it's easy to get them to lie.
[03:38:43.520 --> 03:38:51.520]  That particular person was her private physician in New York and didn't treat her during the brain surgeries and the year in the hospital. That's not the real medical record. Sorry, go ahead.
[03:38:51.520 --> 03:39:07.520]  John Kennedy's doctor falsified his record. She was later rewarded with the position and she was New York based. Dr. Janet Trevelle was rewarded with the position of White House physician in return for her lie about covering up his Addison's disease.
[03:39:07.520 --> 03:39:15.520]  It's incredible. They've been covered up that he broken his back in that PT boat attack on the battleship.
[03:39:15.520 --> 03:39:23.520]  Look, I'll tell you the one thing that has become the byproduct of these attacks on us. The death threats against me and my family are really up.
[03:39:23.520 --> 03:39:32.520]  I've gotten three and it's only Tuesday this week and they're all the same. The Clintons have killed many people who've gotten in their way. You're next. That's the one I read on the way here.
[03:39:32.520 --> 03:39:40.520]  They always come from email addresses I can't identify and when you try to trace them, they're untraceable. I'm really getting fed up with this, frankly.
[03:39:40.520 --> 03:39:47.520]  It upsets my wife. It upsets my family and I'm not going to stop. No number of death threats is going to stop.
[03:39:47.520 --> 03:39:50.520]  Let me raise this. Let me raise this as I raised this last week.
[03:39:50.520 --> 03:39:56.520]  Tokyo Rose was a collection of women that would get on the radio and tell the guys you're losing.
[03:39:56.520 --> 03:40:02.520]  America has fallen like Baghdad rob when bombers are, you know, bombing a mile behind you in Baghdad.
[03:40:02.520 --> 03:40:10.520]  He says the US has been kicked out of Iraq and the Germans had their own people that would pop propaganda in as Berlin was about to fall.
[03:40:10.520 --> 03:40:13.520]  They were still broadcasting that they had defeated the allies.
[03:40:13.520 --> 03:40:19.520]  And so there is this level of this and I know they've killed a lot of people. We know your gangsters. We know your murderers.
[03:40:19.520 --> 03:40:27.520]  I always wonder why they tell me we can kill you or we can come after you. That's why I'm fighting you. I know you got me fired.
[03:40:27.520 --> 03:40:32.520]  They physically attacked me, you know, 17, 18 years ago and told me this is for the Clintons.
[03:40:32.520 --> 03:40:34.520]  That's why I fight harder.
[03:40:34.520 --> 03:40:45.520]  But it's like when Hitler started bombing England, when he couldn't get him to surrender, he thought bombing civilian targets and cities where kids had been sent to be safe would make the British back down.
[03:40:45.520 --> 03:40:51.520]  Instead, a lot of British didn't want the war. Once you bomb civilian centers, they wanted the war.
[03:40:51.520 --> 03:40:57.520]  I don't get why these psychopaths think threatening us intimidates us. That might work with the average schmo on the street.
[03:40:57.520 --> 03:41:01.520]  All it does is make me work 18 hours a day. Is that what you're saying, Roger Stone?
[03:41:01.520 --> 03:41:15.520]  That's exactly what I'm saying. So if in the next few months they tell you that I had a brain tumor or that I had a brain hemorrhage or that I was killed in a hunting accident or that I was depressed and I took me on life, go handcuff Hillary because that's who did it.
[03:41:15.520 --> 03:41:19.520]  That's the only protection we have. I don't fear you. I no longer fear you.
[03:41:19.520 --> 03:41:26.520]  We're all going to die. Hell, let me go out with some turd on legs taking me out, you piece of crap. God's going to get you in the end.
[03:41:26.520 --> 03:41:33.520]  I will never commit suicide. I love life. I'm not involved in anything that's dangerous or bad. I don't even speed anymore.
[03:41:33.520 --> 03:41:38.520]  And if you kill me, it's going to come out bastards. Paul Watson, you want to talk to that?
[03:41:38.520 --> 03:41:51.520]  Well, yeah, I can talk to death threats. I mean, I made a video saying that Islam's not religion of peace and I got about 20 death threats from people saying, we're going to prove that it is a religion of peace by killing you.
[03:41:51.520 --> 03:42:02.520]  If that makes any sense, which of course it doesn't, then Black Lives Matter. I got 25 death threats within a 24 hour period because I posted an image of the guy who was shot by cops saying that he was a criminal.
[03:42:02.520 --> 03:42:10.520]  Then you icon. Then you had, of course, Julian Assange put out tweets of Bob Beckel saying that he should be assassinated.
[03:42:10.520 --> 03:42:18.520]  We see this bizarre incident outside the Ecuadorian embassy where this guy tries to break in. There's a police station that's constantly watching over that embassy.
[03:42:18.520 --> 03:42:24.520]  Two minutes walk away, two minutes walk, and it takes them two hours to respond.
[03:42:24.520 --> 03:42:34.520]  Definitely an assassin. I told you, and of course there's been a question by James Woods on what's the vaguest line on how long he's going to be alive, Assange.
[03:42:34.520 --> 03:42:38.520]  Assange has dumped this stuff now. Go ahead.
[03:42:38.520 --> 03:42:43.520]  I don't disagree with that, but anyway, Slice of Assange is the man's a hero. He's a freedom fighter.
[03:42:43.520 --> 03:42:48.520]  It's interesting how the left loved him when he was leaking stuff against the bushes, but now...
[03:42:48.520 --> 03:42:50.520]  He's bipartisan. He stands up for what's right.
[03:42:50.520 --> 03:42:57.520]  Well, he's fighting the deep state is what he's doing. He's fighting the police state, the two-party duopoly that's run this country and is running the world.
[03:42:57.520 --> 03:43:01.520]  The police state and the cop changing your tire. It's the big guys up top.
[03:43:01.520 --> 03:43:02.520]  No question about it.
[03:43:02.520 --> 03:43:03.520]  Keep going.
[03:43:03.520 --> 03:43:11.520]  So from my point of view here, they are more scared than they have ever been. They're near hysterical and they're attacked around us.
[03:43:11.520 --> 03:43:12.520]  Hillary's diapers are full of it.
[03:43:12.520 --> 03:43:22.520]  It has taken on a vituperative nature that I've never seen before. There aren't one or two or three articles from Media Matters attacking me in the last 24 hours.
[03:43:22.520 --> 03:43:27.520]  There's four. It's not going to work, folks. Nobody's buying your crap.
[03:43:27.520 --> 03:43:32.520]  And we don't care what you do to us. They just as cowards, they don't get that.
[03:43:32.520 --> 03:43:38.520]  When they threaten us over and over again, I always say to them, you don't understand. I know you're murderers.
[03:43:38.520 --> 03:43:44.520]  Do they not understand that, first of all, we're armed and we're vigilant? We're not afraid of guns.
[03:43:44.520 --> 03:43:47.520]  We understand our Second Amendment rights. We're not afraid.
[03:43:47.520 --> 03:43:52.520]  So if you want to come, come, but I'm not sure who's going to end up dead, you or me.
[03:43:52.520 --> 03:43:54.520]  And I always get emails from people who are more likely you.
[03:43:54.520 --> 03:43:57.520]  Exactly. People calling up going, oh, there's a two-way street in the world.
[03:43:57.520 --> 03:44:01.520]  I mean, people might get me, but I got a lot of family that are just good people.
[03:44:01.520 --> 03:44:10.520]  Yeah, no, no, this is an absurdity. I'm against violence, and I made that very clear, even though they keep accusing me of being the one who is fomenting violence.
[03:44:10.520 --> 03:44:14.520]  Violence solves nothing, but they're the ones who resort to the death threats.
[03:44:14.520 --> 03:44:19.520]  I'm not threatening the Clintons other than with exposure of the facts about their criminality.
[03:44:19.520 --> 03:44:23.520]  Oh, what about when they said Trump was threatening when he said they're going to take your guns with these judges?
[03:44:23.520 --> 03:44:26.520]  You may claim Second Amendment have some other option.
[03:44:26.520 --> 03:44:33.520]  That's nothing compared to my cold, dead hand with Heston, you know, everything that's a cliche about the Second Amendment when all others fail.
[03:44:33.520 --> 03:44:39.520]  Meanwhile, Hillary's on tape saying in 2008, Obama better watch it, he'll end up like Bobby Kennedy.
[03:44:39.520 --> 03:44:44.520]  They asked her why she's staying in the race, and she says, well, you know, Bobby Kennedy got assassinated in his latest June,
[03:44:44.520 --> 03:44:49.520]  meaning she was hoping for the assassination of Obama. Now, there's the epitome of racism.
[03:44:49.520 --> 03:44:54.520]  Well, here's the deal. I don't want some physical fight with a bunch of order takers at media matters that just take their White House orders
[03:44:54.520 --> 03:44:59.520]  and put it out for the media as offense. But you're right, media matters doesn't have traffic.
[03:44:59.520 --> 03:45:03.520]  People ask me, why do I care? Because they get the orders, it goes out to the media.
[03:45:03.520 --> 03:45:09.520]  They say, ban stone, it happens. I personally got over, we never bragged about this,
[03:45:09.520 --> 03:45:13.520]  but over 250 affiliates a couple of years ago, we never had about 170.
[03:45:13.520 --> 03:45:16.520]  A lot of them were big stations, and we're still on some big stations.
[03:45:16.520 --> 03:45:21.520]  50,000 waters and stuff, 100,000 watt FM's, 50,000 watt AM's that cover like five states.
[03:45:21.520 --> 03:45:27.520]  I had the program director, some of them I've known for years, in places like Texas.
[03:45:27.520 --> 03:45:33.520]  People I've been fishing with, you know, patriots, they go, listen, I know I can tell you this off record,
[03:45:33.520 --> 03:45:37.520]  just don't say the station, they're going to offer us 200,000 a month to take you off.
[03:45:37.520 --> 03:45:43.520]  The show brings in like 50, 60 a month. I don't want to do this, but the owners are going to fire me if I don't.
[03:45:43.520 --> 03:45:47.520]  What do I do? Should I quit? I said, you know, this has happened all over the country.
[03:45:47.520 --> 03:45:51.520]  It's okay, just do your job. But I said, next, you're going to start getting censored,
[03:45:51.520 --> 03:45:55.520]  and they're going to kick off the other real conservatives, and you know what, they did.
[03:45:55.520 --> 03:46:00.520]  Six months later, they got rid of them, and then I found out all over the country,
[03:46:00.520 --> 03:46:05.520]  they are even micromanaging local affiliates and kicking the patriots off locally.
[03:46:05.520 --> 03:46:11.520]  Even though they have ratings that are making money, and they'll come in and pay huge amounts of money
[03:46:11.520 --> 03:46:15.520]  to put another host on who spews their garbage through advertising and paola.
[03:46:15.520 --> 03:46:21.520]  And their ratings drop. And their ratings for alternative conservative media go up.
[03:46:21.520 --> 03:46:25.520]  So the problem is they forced the air out of the room over here. Everybody goes to the web.
[03:46:25.520 --> 03:46:27.520]  Now they got to kill that.
[03:46:27.520 --> 03:46:32.520]  Right. So they character assassinate Roger Ailes, who's a great patriot and a pioneer of television,
[03:46:32.520 --> 03:46:38.520]  and who has made them extraordinarily profitable at Fox, and built a giant constituency.
[03:46:38.520 --> 03:46:43.520]  Dude, if they're spending 200,000 a month to take me off one station, this is panic level. I'm sorry.
[03:46:43.520 --> 03:46:47.520]  They are going to convert the Fox to the Sky Channel in the UK.
[03:46:47.520 --> 03:46:53.520]  And in the United States, their ratings are going to drop, and their profitability is going to drop
[03:46:53.520 --> 03:46:56.520]  while their viewers at Fox are going to move elsewhere.
[03:46:56.520 --> 03:46:59.520]  But they're willing to do it because they mean to take it all out.
[03:46:59.520 --> 03:47:02.520]  They're going to try, but it ain't over until it's over.
[03:47:02.520 --> 03:47:05.520]  What do you think about Murdoch's kids? Because we've confirmed what we already knew from sources.
[03:47:05.520 --> 03:47:09.520]  I talked to Fox execs, the same hotel you did. They said, no, off record, it's true.
[03:47:09.520 --> 03:47:12.520]  We're being taken over. We're going to be like CNN now.
[03:47:12.520 --> 03:47:15.520]  I cannot believe they're going to do this. They make a billion bucks a year.
[03:47:15.520 --> 03:47:17.520]  But see, they make trillions running the whole show.
[03:47:17.520 --> 03:47:25.520]  Well, and one of Murdoch's sons is married to one of Bloomberg's relatives who works at the Clinton Foundation.
[03:47:25.520 --> 03:47:29.520]  The Murdoch sons, unlike their father, they're their liberals.
[03:47:29.520 --> 03:47:34.520]  And they're very embarrassed when they go to the right upper east side New York cocktail parties,
[03:47:34.520 --> 03:47:37.520]  and people say, oh, you own Fox. How embarrassing.
[03:47:37.520 --> 03:47:40.520]  No, Fox is a moneymaker. Ailes is a great American.
[03:47:40.520 --> 03:47:43.520]  He's been handed everything. Yeah. And he's been smeared here.
[03:47:43.520 --> 03:47:48.520]  And they've run him off because he was committed to the defeat of Hillary Clinton.
[03:47:48.520 --> 03:47:52.520]  Paul, this is epic. I mean, I hired you 15 years ago.
[03:47:52.520 --> 03:47:55.520]  What is it like for you to see all this craziness today?
[03:47:55.520 --> 03:47:58.520]  I mean, it's the hardest I've worked in any year.
[03:47:58.520 --> 03:48:04.520]  But with the Fox thing, they had two different segments talking about Hillary's health recently.
[03:48:04.520 --> 03:48:06.520]  I almost did an article on this.
[03:48:06.520 --> 03:48:10.520]  Three guests on one segment, two on a different segment with the two hosts.
[03:48:10.520 --> 03:48:16.520]  So you had a total of seven people on these two different Fox shows, not Fox Business, which is slightly different.
[03:48:16.520 --> 03:48:23.520]  Seven different people all agreeing with Hillary Clinton talking points on Fox News,
[03:48:23.520 --> 03:48:27.520]  saying that these health questions have not been more than a conspiracy theory.
[03:48:27.520 --> 03:48:30.520]  Seven people on Fox News all agreeing.
[03:48:30.520 --> 03:48:33.520]  And all since the coup one month ago.
[03:48:33.520 --> 03:48:41.520]  No, Fox News reported last Thursday that this entire health canard was cooked up by right-wing conspiracy theorist Roger Stone.
[03:48:41.520 --> 03:48:45.520]  They named me. It's extraordinary that Fox would even carry that.
[03:48:45.520 --> 03:48:48.520]  So the Clintons are calling me out. They're writing a script.
[03:48:48.520 --> 03:48:51.520]  Yeah, it's Kafkaesque. It's so weird.
[03:48:51.520 --> 03:48:57.520]  The thing is, though, other countries that got taken over by really hardcore tyrannies,
[03:48:57.520 --> 03:49:01.520]  people were usually serfs, but the slaves weren't treated bad on average.
[03:49:01.520 --> 03:49:05.520]  They weren't defending slavery, but they weren't treated bad like in Russia or Germany or wherever.
[03:49:05.520 --> 03:49:08.520]  And then a really crazy tyranny would come in, like the French Revolution,
[03:49:08.520 --> 03:49:10.520]  killing everybody and folks would turn against it.
[03:49:10.520 --> 03:49:15.520]  Here we have the institutions of freedom, Second Amendment, SIL, some awake people,
[03:49:15.520 --> 03:49:18.520]  with the paradox of great evil massing.
[03:49:18.520 --> 03:49:23.520]  So they're doing their old game plan, but with our old system still parallel,
[03:49:23.520 --> 03:49:26.520]  do they realize that they're not doing this in the dark?
[03:49:26.520 --> 03:49:32.520]  No, I don't think they do. It's like when at least three, and perhaps four people,
[03:49:32.520 --> 03:49:37.520]  connected to the Democratic National Committee theft of the nomination from Bernie Sanders and Hillary,
[03:49:37.520 --> 03:49:42.520]  end up dead, and we raise that as odd and say maybe it's not coincidental.
[03:49:42.520 --> 03:49:46.520]  They call us conspiracy theories. Like what we're saying isn't common sense.
[03:49:46.520 --> 03:49:49.520]  And then the Times comes out and basically says, yeah, that's my source. They murdered him.
[03:49:49.520 --> 03:49:50.520]  Oh, just shut up.
[03:49:50.520 --> 03:49:51.520]  Yeah, or...
[03:49:51.520 --> 03:49:53.520]  That was guys scaling the building.
[03:49:53.520 --> 03:50:00.520]  Yeah, it's extraordinary that they are so obtuse about what's really happening in the country.
[03:50:00.520 --> 03:50:02.520]  And what will happen if Hillary is elected?
[03:50:02.520 --> 03:50:06.520]  Widespread civil disobedience, and I think the government will not be able to function.
[03:50:06.520 --> 03:50:08.520]  She'll never be able to govern.
[03:50:08.520 --> 03:50:13.520]  This is a woman with sorrows pushing, killing cops and overthrowing government.
[03:50:13.520 --> 03:50:17.520]  Don't they already get that the NSA and stuff is already doing the leaks?
[03:50:17.520 --> 03:50:20.520]  This is just a warning. This is just an opening salvo.
[03:50:20.520 --> 03:50:26.520]  No, and this whole narrative that the Russians and Putin are in bed with Trump,
[03:50:26.520 --> 03:50:32.520]  or more precisely, Trump is in bed with the Russians, they're accusing him of treason.
[03:50:32.520 --> 03:50:34.520]  Who are the conspiracy theorists?
[03:50:34.520 --> 03:50:39.520]  There's a conspiracy theory that Donald Trump, a loyal American who's never met Vladimir Putin in his life,
[03:50:39.520 --> 03:50:45.520]  or Paul Manafort, his former campaign chairman, who Putin despises because Manafort pushed the Ukraine
[03:50:45.520 --> 03:50:50.520]  into the European Union, which he opposed, that they are somehow traitors to their own country,
[03:50:50.520 --> 03:50:55.520]  working for Russia, nonsense. There's a conspiracy theory for you.
[03:50:55.520 --> 03:51:01.520]  All I gotta say is, isn't Hillary rotting and falling apart in front of us and shaking and addled,
[03:51:01.520 --> 03:51:05.520]  emblematic of the rotting power structure and what it's trying right now,
[03:51:05.520 --> 03:51:09.520]  that they would have the arrogance to try to run a reanimated corpse?
[03:51:09.520 --> 03:51:17.520]  Bernie Sanders had the election stolen from him. They are so arrogant.
[03:51:17.520 --> 03:51:20.520]  Say anything you want about Bernie. I think he really believes what he's talking about.
[03:51:20.520 --> 03:51:25.520]  He's really a progressive. I think he's a sincere guy. I don't think he's a crook.
[03:51:25.520 --> 03:51:28.520]  But the Clintons are not liberals or progressives.
[03:51:28.520 --> 03:51:33.520]  They're crony capitalists who march to the tune of George Soros.
[03:51:33.520 --> 03:51:36.520]  Paul Watson, I'm gonna take a few phone calls here at the end of this transmission weather point
[03:51:36.520 --> 03:51:39.520]  you want to add that I'm going right to the calls.
[03:51:39.520 --> 03:51:42.520]  Yeah, a couple more things, Alex. WikiLeaks put out a tweet today.
[03:51:42.520 --> 03:51:47.520]  Bombshell set to hit Clinton campaign as FBR recovers 15,000 deleted emails.
[03:51:47.520 --> 03:51:49.520]  So we've got that coming down the pipeline.
[03:51:49.520 --> 03:51:53.520]  Of course, WikiLeaks has been releasing some Hillary's health stuff recently,
[03:51:53.520 --> 03:51:58.520]  the cracked head inquiry to the NFL chief, but also this thing that we reported on,
[03:51:58.520 --> 03:52:01.520]  which is massive, which is not getting enough attention.
[03:52:01.520 --> 03:52:07.520]  She was interested in decision fatigue. Now, a side effect of decision fatigue
[03:52:07.520 --> 03:52:10.520]  is getting angry at colleagues.
[03:52:10.520 --> 03:52:14.520]  This is another branch to this Hillary's health controversy.
[03:52:14.520 --> 03:52:18.520]  Hillary's temper tantrums, the New York Post reported back in October
[03:52:18.520 --> 03:52:24.520]  that her staffers were literally falling apart in tears about her rages, her endless rage.
[03:52:24.520 --> 03:52:27.520]  We've had secret service agents say the same thing.
[03:52:27.520 --> 03:52:31.520]  Now you've got Vince Foster. Researchers go to the National Archives.
[03:52:31.520 --> 03:52:36.520]  They go back a second time and find that these documents relating to Hillary Clinton's
[03:52:36.520 --> 03:52:41.520]  link to Vince Foster's suicide have mysteriously gone missing.
[03:52:41.520 --> 03:52:44.520]  Now, of course, whether you believe he was killed or committed suicide,
[03:52:44.520 --> 03:52:51.520]  we know his death was preceded by Hillary Clinton humiliating him in front of his colleagues,
[03:52:51.520 --> 03:52:53.520]  having one of these rage.
[03:52:53.520 --> 03:52:58.520]  Look, I'll just say this and we know and we know because she says it in her own book.
[03:52:58.520 --> 03:53:00.520]  In essence, she ordered the body moved.
[03:53:00.520 --> 03:53:03.520]  I don't know whether he committed suicide or whether he killed himself,
[03:53:03.520 --> 03:53:07.520]  but here's what I do know. His body is found 30 yards down a muddy trail.
[03:53:07.520 --> 03:53:12.520]  It has rained only two hours previously, but there is no mud or even dirt on his shoulder.
[03:53:12.520 --> 03:53:15.520]  He was carrying a carpet, a rolled up carpet.
[03:53:15.520 --> 03:53:19.520]  Look, you can just, I don't just say this as a self-fulfilling prophecy or as wishful thinking.
[03:53:19.520 --> 03:53:25.520]  My gut tells me if they try to steal it and stall her, she's going to die in office very early.
[03:53:25.520 --> 03:53:30.520]  They're done. I mean, I just sense and smell failure on these people.
[03:53:30.520 --> 03:53:34.520]  That explains the hysteria. That explains the personal attacks.
[03:53:34.520 --> 03:53:40.520]  That explains the name calling and the vituperous nature of the attacks on any Clinton critic.
[03:53:40.520 --> 03:53:43.520]  The media has dropped all pretense of objectivity.
[03:53:43.520 --> 03:53:48.520]  They're the running dog lackeys for the New World Order and they're letting it show.
[03:53:48.520 --> 03:53:50.520]  They're in deep trouble and they know it.
[03:53:50.520 --> 03:53:53.520]  All right. I apologize to the callers. I've been a horrible person.
[03:53:53.520 --> 03:53:55.520]  Let's give each person a minute or so.
[03:53:55.520 --> 03:54:00.520]  Chris in Virginia, that owl killer here on the air. Go ahead and tell me what I've done wrong.
[03:54:00.520 --> 03:54:04.520]  Yeah. So I'm in Virginia and I'm trying to rally black Americans,
[03:54:04.520 --> 03:54:09.520]  especially convicted felons around Donald Trump and around M4 Wars.
[03:54:09.520 --> 03:54:15.520]  But the problem I'm finding out is that every time a black male dies and he has a criminal record,
[03:54:15.520 --> 03:54:19.520]  he's considered a thug. I'm just wondering what your thoughts on that is.
[03:54:19.520 --> 03:54:23.520]  Well, I would say that I was kind of a thug when I was about 15 years old.
[03:54:23.520 --> 03:54:27.520]  I mean, I think a thug is just somebody that's kind of mean and ready to get in a fight.
[03:54:27.520 --> 03:54:33.520]  I think the modern parlance had better to be a thug than one of these ninnies that just plays video games all day.
[03:54:33.520 --> 03:54:39.520]  So I think there is a problem, though, with thug culture that's been directed as a weapon on black people.
[03:54:39.520 --> 03:54:41.520]  And I think it should be absolutely rejected.
[03:54:41.520 --> 03:54:46.520]  That's why I fight to try to stop the targeting of black people for abortions,
[03:54:46.520 --> 03:54:50.520]  52% of which never get out of the womb, because here's the deal.
[03:54:50.520 --> 03:54:54.520]  I'm not going to put my soul on the line supporting killing babies.
[03:54:54.520 --> 03:54:58.520]  So, but I'm not going to do some virtue signaling here.
[03:54:58.520 --> 03:55:04.520]  Quite frankly, I'm threatened by some of the thug culture, whether it be white trash folks or, you know, thugs or whatever.
[03:55:04.520 --> 03:55:07.520]  Black thugs, you name it. I mean, I'm threatened by thug culture.
[03:55:07.520 --> 03:55:10.520]  That's why I'm trying to keep people out of thug culture. What do you say to that?
[03:55:10.520 --> 03:55:14.520]  Yeah, I definitely understand where you're coming from.
[03:55:14.520 --> 03:55:18.520]  And another point, same question I asked to Carl Jackson was, you know,
[03:55:18.520 --> 03:55:25.520]  how can we get more blacks around the liberty movement when we're looked at as a society as a whole as a minority?
[03:55:25.520 --> 03:55:26.520]  You know?
[03:55:26.520 --> 03:55:30.520]  Well, I mean, I think there's a distortion because even though blacks on average are involved in more violent crime,
[03:55:30.520 --> 03:55:34.520]  that still is crime, statistically overall, is small.
[03:55:34.520 --> 03:55:36.520]  It's media distortion.
[03:55:36.520 --> 03:55:41.520]  All I'm saying is if you're a leader, no matter what color you are, stand up against the New World Order and people will follow.
[03:55:41.520 --> 03:55:44.520]  I appreciate your call. Let's take it real quick.
[03:55:44.520 --> 03:55:45.520]  Another one here.
[03:55:45.520 --> 03:55:49.520]  You're on the air with Roger Stone, Paul Watson. Go ahead.
[03:55:49.520 --> 03:55:50.520]  Hey, Alex.
[03:55:50.520 --> 03:55:53.520]  Last time we spoke, we had a very good conversation.
[03:55:53.520 --> 03:55:57.520]  I just want to say that I think I have something that can steal the elected for Donald Trump.
[03:55:57.520 --> 03:56:04.520]  He went after the people that are leading us into war saying that he doesn't want to take advice from them anymore.
[03:56:04.520 --> 03:56:07.520]  And where he said that, I listened to General Michael D. Flint.
[03:56:07.520 --> 03:56:12.520]  He's got a harp on that we came and we saw he died with Gaddafi.
[03:56:12.520 --> 03:56:15.520]  He's got a harp on how they're trying to...
[03:56:15.520 --> 03:56:20.520]  I agree to be raised that there was a failed state, that she backed Al Qaeda, that General Flynn has exposed that.
[03:56:20.520 --> 03:56:21.520]  I agree.
[03:56:21.520 --> 03:56:25.520]  That's a big plus for Trump that you did, that Flynn's his main advisor on the military.
[03:56:25.520 --> 03:56:26.520]  Flynn is the best.
[03:56:26.520 --> 03:56:30.520]  Well, I think an examination of what happened in Libya is absolutely crucial.
[03:56:30.520 --> 03:56:33.520]  Hillary Clinton runs as an advocate for women.
[03:56:33.520 --> 03:56:36.520]  Yet, she is the one who fomented the toppling of Gaddafi.
[03:56:36.520 --> 03:56:42.520]  Now, Gaddafi wasn't a great guy, but he was sharing all of his intelligence on Al Qaeda and ISIS with us.
[03:56:42.520 --> 03:56:44.520]  He'd come into the West for eight years.
[03:56:44.520 --> 03:56:47.520]  He'd invested all his money and he was an angel compared to them.
[03:56:47.520 --> 03:56:48.520]  We stabbed him in the back.
[03:56:48.520 --> 03:56:51.520]  And he renounced his nuclear ambitions.
[03:56:51.520 --> 03:56:53.520]  So what is the plight of women in Libya today?
[03:56:53.520 --> 03:56:57.520]  That tells people, if you work with us and stop being radical, we're going to stab you in the back.
[03:56:57.520 --> 03:56:59.520]  So what is the plight of women today in Libya?
[03:56:59.520 --> 03:57:03.520]  Under Gaddafi, women could own property.
[03:57:03.520 --> 03:57:05.520]  They could travel without the approval of their husband.
[03:57:05.520 --> 03:57:06.520]  Go to college?
[03:57:06.520 --> 03:57:07.520]  They could go to college.
[03:57:07.520 --> 03:57:09.520]  They could have as much education as they wished.
[03:57:09.520 --> 03:57:11.520]  They could travel without the permission of their husband.
[03:57:11.520 --> 03:57:15.520]  And if a woman were raped, the rapist would be prosecuted.
[03:57:15.520 --> 03:57:17.520]  Today, none of those things are possible.
[03:57:17.520 --> 03:57:18.520]  Ask backwards.
[03:57:18.520 --> 03:57:21.520]  And if a woman is raped, she shall be stoned to death.
[03:57:21.520 --> 03:57:27.520]  This is what Hillary Clinton has brought the women of Libya, the so-called advocates for women.
[03:57:27.520 --> 03:57:29.520]  I'll kill her amount of time.
[03:57:29.520 --> 03:57:31.520]  I apologize to John and John and Anthony.
[03:57:31.520 --> 03:57:33.520]  If you call me back tomorrow, I promise I'll go to the head of the line.
[03:57:33.520 --> 03:57:41.520]  In fact, Harman, give them all free Hillary for prison shirts or those letting rape shirts available at infowarsstore.com for holding.
[03:57:41.520 --> 03:57:43.520]  And that's not getting to them.
[03:57:43.520 --> 03:57:51.520]  And please support the broadcast, the natural defense, living defense, special 20% off in today free shipping in order for the dollars or more.
[03:57:51.520 --> 03:57:55.520]  And of course, we have auto ship 10% off additional on top of that.
[03:57:55.520 --> 03:57:58.520]  Paul Watson, we've got 60 seconds. Take us out.
[03:57:58.520 --> 03:58:10.520]  I'll just finish on saying that there's a new email that's just come out, WikiLeaks, where Hillary Clinton is talking about Bill her husband being, quote, very interested in meeting with Vladimir Putin.
[03:58:10.520 --> 03:58:15.520]  So we're taught that Trump is the big Russofile and it's Bill begging for private meetings.
[03:58:15.520 --> 03:58:16.520]  Put that article out.
[03:58:16.520 --> 03:58:20.520]  Hillary Bill begged to meet with Putin. WikiLeaks.
[03:58:20.520 --> 03:58:21.520]  That's the article.
[03:58:21.520 --> 03:58:24.520]  What else do we have, Lord Watson?
[03:58:24.520 --> 03:58:29.520]  Again, Hillary Clinton's policies have led to the deaths and displacement of millions of Muslims.
[03:58:29.520 --> 03:58:31.520]  She's the biggest threat to Muslims.
[03:58:31.520 --> 03:58:33.520]  And that should be part of the narrative.
[03:58:33.520 --> 03:58:35.520]  It isn't. That's what Trump needs to push.
[03:58:35.520 --> 03:58:40.520]  That's right. All right, folks, we got Trump coverage tonight live seven o'clock central infowars.com.
[03:58:40.520 --> 03:58:42.520]  He's here in the ATX.
[03:58:42.520 --> 03:58:43.520]  Thanks, Roger Stone.
[03:58:43.520 --> 03:58:44.520]  Great to be here.
