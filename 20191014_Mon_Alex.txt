[00:00.000 --> 00:05.740]  Gavin McInnis is back with his all new online network, FreeSpeech.tv, Gavin McInnis, Joe
[00:05.740 --> 00:30.500]  Biggs, Miley Unopolis, and Soph, all at FreeSpeech.tv.
[00:30.500 --> 00:45.700]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:45.700 --> 00:49.780]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's October 14th, 2019.
[00:49.780 --> 00:55.380]  I am your host, Alex Jones, and we're going to be live here for the next four hours.
[00:55.380 --> 01:02.180]  James O'Keefe of Project Veritas has what could end up being over 1,000 hours, they're
[01:02.180 --> 01:08.300]  going over it right now, inside CNN.
[01:08.300 --> 01:15.700]  Ladies and gentlemen, with their CEO, Jeff Zucker, saying incredible things.
[01:15.700 --> 01:20.220]  I've been made privy to some of these, I'm not going to talk about them until it breaks,
[01:20.220 --> 01:24.780]  and it's scheduled to break anytime right now, and Project Veritas will post it right
[01:24.780 --> 01:28.300]  to Infowars.com, right to NewsWars.com.
[01:28.300 --> 01:35.300]  James O'Keefe is going to be joining us at the start of the second hour as well.
[01:35.300 --> 01:39.660]  All hell is breaking loose, obviously, militarily in the Middle East.
[01:39.660 --> 01:41.020]  Things are happening with the economy.
[01:41.020 --> 01:45.820]  You've got this Soros Mule testifying the Fort Congress, Fiona Hill, who we blew out
[01:45.820 --> 01:49.900]  of the water two years ago as a Soros operative, and she's one of the main whistleblowers.
[01:49.900 --> 01:52.420]  We'll explain all that.
[01:52.420 --> 01:59.660]  So memeworld.com has a contributor who, a year ago, put out a video based on the Kingsman
[01:59.660 --> 02:04.620]  movie series where people come to kill the Kingsman, who's Trump, and he fights back
[02:04.620 --> 02:05.940]  and takes out the media.
[02:05.940 --> 02:06.940]  It's satirical.
[02:06.940 --> 02:11.220]  The actual New York Times promotes plays where Trump's being killed, and has writers saying,
[02:11.220 --> 02:13.820]  let's assassinate him, and let's attack Trump supporters.
[02:13.820 --> 02:18.180]  But then when there's a satirical thing, they go, oh my gosh, Trump's got to decry this.
[02:18.180 --> 02:20.340]  There's going to be attacks on the media any minute.
[02:20.340 --> 02:21.340]  It's all Trump's fault.
[02:21.340 --> 02:23.060]  He's got to resign right now.
[02:23.060 --> 02:24.060]  That's all coming up.
[02:24.060 --> 02:25.060]  We've got that video.
[02:25.060 --> 02:26.220]  They've tried to expunge off the web.
[02:26.220 --> 02:27.700]  It's posted in FortWars.com.
[02:27.700 --> 02:29.420]  We'll let you make your own decision.
[02:29.420 --> 02:32.700]  We'll be playing that coming up as well.
[02:32.700 --> 02:38.220]  The first thing I want to get to here is James O'Keefe teasing this Saturday.
[02:38.220 --> 02:39.420]  Then we've got his latest video.
[02:39.420 --> 02:44.020]  It came out just a few minutes ago with a small clip of the CNN CEO.
[02:44.020 --> 02:45.900]  But more is coming probably by the next segment.
[02:45.900 --> 03:02.540]  Here it is.
[03:15.900 --> 03:26.380]  Now, that's going to be breaking here, literally, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:26.380 --> 03:30.700]  As we speak, now let's go ahead and go to clip 20 now.
[03:30.700 --> 03:31.700]  Here it is.
[03:31.700 --> 03:32.700]  O'Keefe here.
[03:32.700 --> 03:36.860]  So I had a chance to listen to this morning's Jeff Zucker call, the president of CNN's
[03:36.860 --> 03:40.220]  Morning 9 a.m. editorial meeting call.
[03:40.220 --> 03:45.180]  Thanks very much to our insider who's still secretly recording inside the network.
[03:45.180 --> 03:50.140]  And we actually had a chance to listen to Jeff Zucker talk to his staff this morning
[03:50.140 --> 03:55.580]  about Project Veritas and the imminent exposed CNN hidden camera tapes.
[03:55.580 --> 04:25.300]  I'm sure the intonation in Jeff Zucker's voice would suggest otherwise about the fact that
[04:25.300 --> 04:28.380]  he's not concerned because here's why he should be concerned.
[04:28.380 --> 04:33.980]  The insider who is working for CNN went to work today, he's still recording everything.
[04:33.980 --> 04:37.740]  So we got about 45 minutes, maybe an hour until we launch.
[04:37.740 --> 04:38.740]  Very exciting.
[04:38.740 --> 04:43.580]  It's exposeCNN.com to get the tapes as soon as they launch again.
[04:43.580 --> 04:47.520]  This is not our undercover reporter who went into the building.
[04:47.520 --> 04:50.700]  This is one of Jeff Zucker's own staff.
[04:50.700 --> 04:54.540]  So disgusted by what he saw, he's going to decide to blow the whistle.
[04:54.540 --> 05:01.780]  This is a very exciting and historic day, I think, for citizen journalism and for transparency
[05:01.780 --> 05:03.740]  in our media and our society.
[05:03.740 --> 05:04.740]  Stay tuned.
[05:04.740 --> 05:06.820]  Oh, we're staying tuned.
[05:06.820 --> 05:09.660]  It's all coming up next segment, stay with us.
[05:09.660 --> 05:14.340]  Communist China quietly bought up Hollywood more than a decade ago and they've been approving
[05:14.340 --> 05:19.740]  almost all the scripts that you see on television or in the movies for many years.
[05:19.740 --> 05:23.820]  And now they own our debt, now they own the Democratic Party, now they've merged with
[05:23.820 --> 05:27.860]  Silicon Valley to censor patriots off the air.
[05:27.860 --> 05:31.260]  Washington Post comes out and says they hope that Gigi Ping, the dictator of China, will
[05:31.260 --> 05:33.100]  quote, destroy Trump.
[05:33.100 --> 05:34.100]  That's a headline.
[05:34.100 --> 05:38.300]  So Info Wars has been the Paul Revere of this operation.
[05:38.300 --> 05:42.020]  We have blown the whistle continuously and have been proven right.
[05:42.020 --> 05:46.260]  And that's why it's more important than ever that we override Silicon Valley and their
[05:46.260 --> 05:52.340]  Chai Kong masters by word of mouth and spread the word about Info Wars and check out InfoWarsTour.com.
[05:52.340 --> 05:56.420]  That's where the arsenal of our republic is being funded, that's where the tip of the
[05:56.420 --> 06:22.820]  spear is continually being forged is InfoWarsTour.com.
[06:22.820 --> 06:38.020]  From the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[06:38.020 --> 06:46.300]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. till 3 p.m. Central Standard Time, I'm here, live,
[06:46.300 --> 06:50.740]  ladies and gentlemen.
[06:50.740 --> 06:55.780]  At InfoWars, it's critical for us to stay on the air so that we can be a place that
[06:55.780 --> 07:02.380]  magnifies the incredible independent media organizations that are out there like Project
[07:02.380 --> 07:09.620]  Veritas that is bringing forward such incredible information on a daily basis.
[07:09.620 --> 07:17.500]  They have hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of hours with high-level CNN individual who
[07:17.500 --> 07:26.220]  is in the meetings with Jeff Zucker, the CEO of the criminal organization known as CNN
[07:26.220 --> 07:29.700]  that works to destroy the First Amendment, that works to take our guns, that works for
[07:29.700 --> 07:32.780]  the Chai Coms, destroy our borders.
[07:32.780 --> 07:38.220]  And now they have him talking about, I want everyone to go after Trump on impeachment.
[07:38.220 --> 07:41.300]  Even if there's nothing there, it doesn't matter, just keep promoting it.
[07:41.300 --> 07:43.140]  We're going to remove him from office.
[07:43.140 --> 07:47.660]  I'm told that's what's on the tapes by folks that have seen them.
[07:47.660 --> 07:52.660]  James O'Keefe joins us, start of the next hour.
[07:52.660 --> 07:58.540]  And as of about seven minutes ago, it was scheduled to be released on the special CNN
[07:58.540 --> 08:03.020]  site that they have created to expose this.
[08:03.020 --> 08:13.700]  But this is not someone from Project Veritas infiltrating the group.
[08:13.700 --> 08:21.940]  This is someone inside who's so outraged by the criminal activity and the open lying and
[08:21.940 --> 08:25.980]  the manufacturing information that they're blowing the whistle.
[08:25.980 --> 08:27.660]  And you're going to see more and more of this.
[08:27.660 --> 08:35.380]  And it's going to bring this corrupt system down.
[08:35.380 --> 08:40.380]  Very, very powerful video.
[08:40.380 --> 08:51.740]  Now, we're going to talk to James O'Keefe coming up.
[08:51.740 --> 08:59.700]  And we're going to go over all of this here today, and we're going to take your phone
[08:59.700 --> 09:00.700]  calls as well.
[09:00.700 --> 09:01.700]  And I'm going to host the fourth hour.
[09:01.700 --> 09:05.620]  So we have a lot of time, but James O'Keefe, as I said, is joining us.
[09:05.620 --> 09:14.860]  Meanwhile, while all of this is unfolding, we have Soros, Mole, Fiona Hill, the testifying
[09:14.860 --> 09:16.500]  congressional Ukraine witch hunt.
[09:16.500 --> 09:24.060]  That was our article from Saturday with the exclusive video from 2017 where Roger Stone
[09:24.060 --> 09:26.260]  laid it all out.
[09:26.260 --> 09:30.500]  They've removed that off of YouTube, everywhere else, but we reposted it to Band-Aught Video
[09:30.500 --> 09:32.060]  and it's in those articles.
[09:32.060 --> 09:38.340]  Meet Fiona Hill, the Soros, Mole, aiming to take down Trump and how huge that is and
[09:38.340 --> 09:39.340]  how important that is.
[09:39.340 --> 09:44.300]  She's right now testifying to Congress.
[09:44.300 --> 09:47.820]  And separately, the corporate media that's trying to trigger a civil war, calling for
[09:47.820 --> 09:52.260]  violence against Trump supporters, calling for violence against Trump and his family,
[09:52.260 --> 10:01.980]  is taking a year-old meme that's up on infowars.com in an article, and they've taken the meme
[10:01.980 --> 10:09.780]  down almost everywhere so they can lie about what's in the meme.
[10:09.780 --> 10:19.020]  They can try to do hysteria out of violent Trump meme video, but simply from the Kingsman.
[10:19.020 --> 10:23.860]  And we have an exclusive statement from memeworld.com in Carpe Donkton that knows the maker of this
[10:23.860 --> 10:25.180]  very, very well.
[10:25.180 --> 10:29.700]  They break down and explain the fact that this conservative conference at a Trump hotel,
[10:29.700 --> 10:36.580]  they had a little side room with a meme exhibit with literally 24 hours a day, hundreds, thousands
[10:36.580 --> 10:41.300]  of memes looping, and the New York Times didn't report on any of that or how the conference
[10:41.300 --> 10:44.340]  had an anti-violence event.
[10:44.340 --> 10:48.700]  They just went in this little side room and watched something they could then misrepresent
[10:48.700 --> 10:53.580]  and claim that it showed the president promoting going out and carrying out violence so he
[10:53.580 --> 10:57.740]  needs to decry it and come out and say that he's sorry for how violent his supporters
[10:57.740 --> 11:02.660]  are when they've had all these movies and all these shows and all these statements from
[11:02.660 --> 11:07.180]  the New York Times writers who broke this story and the New York Times promoted the
[11:07.180 --> 11:13.300]  play where Trump is being stabbed to death by his cabinet, like Julius Caesar, but that's
[11:13.300 --> 11:20.180]  the big story today is how much danger the corporate media is in and how everything is
[11:20.180 --> 11:24.700]  falling apart for Trump and how he's got to be removed when really all that's falling
[11:24.700 --> 11:26.860]  apart and very successful is due process.
[11:26.860 --> 11:31.340]  They're now saying they're going to have whistleblowers testify in secret with their
[11:31.340 --> 11:37.220]  faces blacked out and that that won't even be in Congress and no one will even know
[11:37.220 --> 11:41.820]  who they are and Republicans can't ask questions, so they learn with Balazi Ford and all those
[11:41.820 --> 11:45.580]  other women up there lying, most of them come out and admit it, they never even met him,
[11:45.580 --> 11:48.980]  it was totally made up, other women whose names they used when the public had said I
[11:48.980 --> 11:54.020]  never knew Cabinon, that never happened to me, nobody ever did that to me, so now they
[11:54.020 --> 11:58.580]  don't just use the names of women who exist but never were talked to because folks call
[11:58.580 --> 12:03.620]  them up or other women who've been threatened to go lie and then later admit they were threatened
[12:03.620 --> 12:04.620]  to lie.
[12:04.620 --> 12:09.100]  Now they just say oh you can't ever see who it is, they're in a black hole somewhere
[12:09.100 --> 12:12.980]  and they say this is all true even though the other witnesses and the transcript and
[12:12.980 --> 12:16.700]  all the evidence shows it's not even true, that's why Shifty Schiff, Adam Schiff of
[12:16.700 --> 12:24.220]  the committee went on the Sunday shows and said we don't even need quid pro quo anymore,
[12:24.220 --> 12:28.140]  we don't even need any of that, this is how desperate they are, this is how scared they
[12:28.140 --> 12:34.140]  are because the corruption is coming out and Trump is exposing it and on top of it,
[12:34.140 --> 12:41.260]  Bernie general Barr says that there is an unremitting assault on religion and he went
[12:41.260 --> 12:48.940]  on to say that it's an organized assault, not just decay in society, it's an organized
[12:48.940 --> 13:00.260]  destruction by people that want evil, that want evil, so we're going to break it all
[13:00.260 --> 13:05.620]  down today, there is so much, meanwhile the New York Times, oh they admitted that the
[13:05.620 --> 13:10.820]  sky is blue and that fish swim in the water and that grass is green, they admitted the
[13:10.820 --> 13:16.420]  deep stage reel, a shadow government of intelligence agencies and private groups that don't like
[13:16.420 --> 13:20.980]  Trump and they're guardians of America and that's why they're going to overthrow Trump
[13:20.980 --> 13:24.780]  and that's why they're going to take control of the election for our own good while they
[13:24.780 --> 13:30.340]  sell us off to communist China and open our borders and debilitate our nation and sexualize
[13:30.340 --> 13:35.220]  children that the attorney general Bill Barr talks about in a powerful speech, full speeches
[13:35.220 --> 13:45.300]  on infowars.com, we're going to be playing some of that coming up today, it's all coming
[13:45.300 --> 13:50.100]  up ladies and gentlemen, now I'm going to go to break, we're going to have the exclusive
[13:50.100 --> 13:57.220]  project Veritas video on the other side when we come back, we've got James O'Keefe coming
[13:57.220 --> 14:02.860]  on and so much more but right now the world's awakening, people really woke up when it came
[14:02.860 --> 14:07.460]  out that fluoride really does lower fertility and brain damage and when it turned out that
[14:07.460 --> 14:11.060]  Epstein really was running child kidnapping rings and Bill Gates was involved, that's
[14:11.060 --> 14:14.380]  now coming out that Gates got caught lying about being intimately involved with this
[14:14.380 --> 14:18.980]  guy, staying in his house, traveling with him, it's all coming out and people really
[14:18.980 --> 14:22.420]  wake up when they learn that China really does own our debt and China really does own
[14:22.420 --> 14:27.100]  Hollywood, people are waking up to a lot of really big things that are happening but a
[14:27.100 --> 14:32.980]  lot more is coming and the power structure's scared, we're going to go to break and come
[14:32.980 --> 14:41.060]  back with so much more, please don't forget that we're only on air and only able to operate

[17:07.860 --> 17:13.100]  Attention GCN self-reliance listeners, if you've ever wanted an emergency solar survival

[17:17.340 --> 17:19.100]  important message you'll ever hear.

[17:27.620 --> 17:28.620]  off the grid.
[17:28.620 --> 17:32.540]  The clearance price is a result of the historic flooding we're having here right on the east
[17:32.540 --> 17:34.020]  bank of the Mississippi.
[17:34.020 --> 17:37.820]  Because of the flooding, we've had to move a lot of our inventory to a temporary location
[17:37.820 --> 17:41.600]  and rather than move it back to the warehouse, we thought we'd offer the system at a price
[17:41.600 --> 17:45.940]  that might seem unbelievable if you didn't know the flood waters backstory.
[17:45.940 --> 17:51.580]  So here's what you should do right now, check out the PPX microgrid system at myownpowergrid.com,

[17:56.940 --> 17:57.940]  of bonuses too.
[17:57.940 --> 18:02.180]  And the best part, you're not going to pay 750 or 500 dollars, 300 or even 200.
[18:02.180 --> 18:07.020]  Go to myownpowergrid.com to learn more, that's myownpowergrid.com.
[18:07.020 --> 18:13.340]  We sold secret 12 for four years and it was our number third best seller.
[18:13.340 --> 18:17.820]  We had to discontinue it because when you upgrade a formula, you are supposed to rename
[18:17.820 --> 18:18.820]  it.
[18:18.820 --> 18:24.100]  The secret 12 is ultra 12, it's twice as strong as secret 12, the very best vitamin B12 out
[18:24.100 --> 18:25.100]  there.
[18:25.100 --> 18:30.100]  It's got the complex system that lets your body absorb it and it does amazing things,
[18:30.100 --> 18:34.420]  supports healthy nerve and brain cells, helps make DNA, helps the body produce energy, helps
[18:34.420 --> 18:38.180]  produce healthy blood cells, essential for proper nervous system function, it goes on
[18:38.180 --> 18:39.180]  and on.
[18:39.180 --> 18:43.140]  B12 deficiency is a serious problem that could cause anemia, fatigue, weakness, constipation,
[18:43.140 --> 18:47.020]  weight loss, depression, poor memory loss, asthma, vision problems and low sperm count.
[18:47.020 --> 18:52.140]  Online folks, you need ultra 12, it helps something in full war, so it's a 360 win and

[19:09.420 --> 19:14.420]  The globalists have been planning to make their move on America for decades and decades.
[19:14.420 --> 19:18.900]  Hillary was supposed to get in and complete the takeover, the censorship, all of it.
[19:18.900 --> 19:23.340]  That's why they took me off the air first and banned me across the internet because
[19:23.340 --> 19:27.940]  they knew that what we were saying was dead on and they didn't want us raising the alarm.
[19:27.940 --> 19:28.940]  Well, guess what?
[19:28.940 --> 19:32.340]  Thanks to you spreading the word, instead of fastly supporting info wars, we're still
[19:32.340 --> 19:37.340]  on the air and we're still fighting, so please keep spreading the word and keep buying the
[19:37.340 --> 19:38.340]  great products.

[20:03.380 --> 20:13.940]  Again, it's the everything must go sale at infowarstore.com, you're listening to the
[20:13.940 --> 20:35.300]  Alex Jones show, waging war on corruption, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the
[20:35.300 --> 20:45.740]  front lines of the info war, ladies and gentlemen, the establishment is panicking, they don't
[20:45.740 --> 20:53.580]  know what to do, the so-called liberal left in America are not liberal, they are control
[20:53.580 --> 20:59.140]  free people that have given up on humanity that are greedy and hateful and who want total
[20:59.140 --> 21:00.140]  control.
[21:00.140 --> 21:04.500]  They've allied themselves with the Chinese communist and every other form of corruption
[21:04.500 --> 21:09.940]  you can imagine, it's a perfect match, Hollywood and the Chicoms, and they are moving against
[21:09.940 --> 21:13.500]  children, they are moving against families, they are moving against everything that works
[21:13.500 --> 21:18.500]  well and is decent, wholesome and fulfilling, even the Attorney General Bill Barr has come
[21:18.500 --> 21:25.060]  out in a speech, it's posted on infowarstore.com that I suggest you share, I'm tempted to do
[21:25.060 --> 21:30.500]  a whole special show just on his speech, where he says this is organized evil to hurt children
[21:30.500 --> 21:36.780]  and break down the family, and he says they are sexualizing children on an organized level,
[21:36.780 --> 21:42.740]  the democratic party, and he says it's pure evil and we must stand against it, this is
[21:42.740 --> 21:47.580]  the White House doing what we told you, they're going after the pedophiles, there's been
[21:47.580 --> 21:55.340]  a 10 plus fold increase in the number of pedophiles arrested and busted, Trump's the real
[21:55.340 --> 22:00.100]  deal folks, the problem is is the Justice Department is just filled with yes men that
[22:00.100 --> 22:04.660]  have been put in beneath Trump over the years, and Trump has only gotten the first level
[22:04.660 --> 22:10.100]  cleaned out even partially, but believe me Barr wouldn't give speeches about fighting
[22:10.100 --> 22:15.660]  pedophile rings if he might have been somewhat corrupt in the past, he's definitely maybe
[22:15.660 --> 22:20.660]  loves his grandchildren or something, but he saw the light, you want to play that you know
[22:20.660 --> 22:26.820]  shong for yourself Hank Williams, I saw the light, we got to come back with I saw the
[22:26.820 --> 22:32.620]  light it's on the computer, so I'm just stunned by the point we're at and we're going to
[22:32.620 --> 22:35.980]  cover it all today, O'Keeffe just released another video saying they're uploading the
[22:35.980 --> 22:40.020]  video it's coming out now, they've been staying up for days going over hundreds of hours
[22:40.020 --> 22:47.060]  of video, this is only the first installment, they're getting more recordings this morning
[22:47.060 --> 22:58.100]  meetings with Mark Zucker, not Mark Zucker, that's Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Zucker, and it's
[22:58.100 --> 23:06.580]  just amazing, so part one CNN whistleblower, secretly record staff, executive network president
[23:06.580 --> 23:11.900]  Jeff Zucker, anti-Trump crusade and personal vendetta those are quotes against the president
[23:11.900 --> 23:19.140]  of the United States, so we're downloading that right now, we will play it when we come
[23:19.140 --> 23:25.260]  back ladies and gentlemen, just unbelievable, and then also up on info wars.com and news
[23:25.260 --> 23:30.660]  wars.com, they've been expunging it off the internet everywhere, so we've posted links
[23:30.660 --> 23:36.180]  to it and grabbed it, we're going to be playing that for you, so you can see the supposed
[23:36.180 --> 23:41.700]  right wing video saying go out and kill the media, that's not what it is, it's the Kingsman
[23:41.700 --> 23:47.260]  movie with Trump's head stuck on the British secret service agents head, when they come
[23:47.260 --> 23:53.500]  into a church and the globalist who want world population reduction I should add in the movie,
[23:53.500 --> 23:58.500]  try to kill him, he takes them out, and so the whole point is the Democrats are saying
[23:58.500 --> 24:07.180]  kill Trump, kill his family, rape, baron, put him in prison, that's what Fonda just said
[24:07.180 --> 24:12.540]  last year, Peter Fonda just died a few months ago, and so it's responding to people saying
[24:12.540 --> 24:17.780]  we're coming to kill you, so they stick their head on that, everybody knows it's a meme,
[24:17.780 --> 24:21.180]  people know how memes work, my head's been stuck on all these people's heads as well
[24:21.180 --> 24:27.020]  for fight scenes, there are thousands of videos conservatively out there, but they're trying
[24:27.020 --> 24:32.260]  to misrepresent that so you can't see it and find out what actually gets broken down.
[24:32.260 --> 24:37.660]  Let's go ahead and play part of this important report, dims, psychotic fantasies come back
[24:37.660 --> 24:57.580]  to haunt them, here it is.
[24:57.580 --> 25:02.700]  With all the censorship big tech is engaged in, it's critical that you sign up for our
[25:02.700 --> 25:09.660]  free newsletter at infowars.com forward slash newsletter, you will get breaking news, videos,
[25:09.660 --> 25:15.780]  great deals at infowarsstore.com and all the latest articles with key intel and analysis,
[25:15.780 --> 25:21.860]  get around the electronic Berlin wall by signing up for our newsletter at infowars.com forward
[25:21.860 --> 25:23.500]  slash newsletter.
[25:23.500 --> 25:28.460]  They aren't going to return back to earth folks, the democratic party has left the
[25:28.460 --> 25:31.620]  moderate building and they are never coming back.
[25:31.620 --> 25:37.300]  I speak to you not as an elected official or public figure, but I speak to you as a
[25:37.300 --> 25:44.100]  human being, a woman whose dreams of motherhood now taste bittersweet because of what I know
[25:44.100 --> 25:50.020]  about our children's future and that our actions are responsible for bringing their
[25:50.020 --> 25:53.540]  most dire possibilities into focus.
[25:53.540 --> 25:58.660]  I speak to you as a daughter and descendant of colonized peoples who have already begun
[25:58.660 --> 25:59.660]  to suffer.
[25:59.660 --> 26:07.780]  So real talk, in this election, in this election, in the last kind of couple, I mean maybe couple
[26:07.780 --> 26:11.660]  months, certainly few weeks, there's this whole conversation that's been coming up about
[26:11.660 --> 26:12.660]  electability.
[26:12.660 --> 26:20.300]  Focus on our campaign, is America ready for that?
[26:20.300 --> 26:26.380]  As of late, their crosshairs have zeroed in on the heart of Providence, attacking what
[26:26.380 --> 26:32.700]  remains of any morality and traditional ethics left in a nation pummeled with depravity.
[26:32.700 --> 26:38.100]  And so I hope that in this country, people who say that they're Jesus loving, God loving,
[26:38.100 --> 26:42.780]  that they pay more attention to God loving, Jesus loving people on this side of the border
[26:42.780 --> 26:48.180]  with brown skin that are desperate, that are being treated cruelly by this president because
[26:48.180 --> 26:50.600]  he clearly doesn't care about them.
[26:50.600 --> 26:52.780]  We need to change his policy.
[26:52.780 --> 27:00.580]  There can be no reward, no benefit, no tax break for anyone or any institution, any organization
[27:00.580 --> 27:06.300]  in America that denies the full human rights and the full civil rights of every single
[27:06.300 --> 27:07.300]  one of us.
[27:07.300 --> 27:11.420]  As president, we're going to make that a priority and we are going to stop those who are infringing
[27:11.420 --> 27:14.340]  upon the human rights of our fellow Americans.
[27:14.340 --> 27:20.740]  Observe how Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg uses Beto O'Rourke's attack on religious freedom
[27:20.740 --> 27:28.620]  to criticize Beto's strategy, not Beto's threat to our First Amendment and our inherent rights.
[27:28.620 --> 27:31.460]  That would be a scandal for this new left.
[27:31.460 --> 27:36.660]  If we want to talk about anti-discrimination law for a school or an organization, absolutely.
[27:36.660 --> 27:38.260]  They should not be able to discriminate.
[27:38.260 --> 27:44.240]  But going after the tax exemption of churches, Islamic centers or other religious facilities
[27:44.240 --> 27:48.140]  in this country, I think that's just going to deepen the divisions that we're already
[27:48.140 --> 27:49.140]  experiencing.
[27:49.140 --> 27:53.940]  At a moment when we're actually seeing more and more people, motivated often by compassion
[27:53.940 --> 27:59.060]  and by people they love, moving in the right direction on LGBTQ rights, which is obviously
[27:59.060 --> 28:09.100]  extremely important to me personally.
[28:09.100 --> 28:15.500]  It's a free-for-all of madness as the Democrats speak in a language of projection, amplifying
[28:15.500 --> 28:22.020]  the very corruption and criminal intent they harbor by superimposing these tendencies on
[28:22.020 --> 28:27.580]  the powers they fear the most, our president and the people that voted him in.
[28:27.580 --> 28:32.580]  I mean, lock her up, I mean, all the things he says, all the vicious mean things he says,
[28:32.580 --> 28:33.580]  they love it.
[28:33.580 --> 28:35.220]  There are these people in this country.
[28:35.220 --> 28:38.220]  They're good Americans, otherwise they'll probably give you the shirt off their back,
[28:38.220 --> 28:41.340]  they'll help you if you need, but they have this fixation.
[28:41.340 --> 28:46.180]  They want to return this country to the white Christian country that they believe it should
[28:46.180 --> 28:47.540]  be again.
[28:47.540 --> 28:52.220]  They don't want the diversity, and they follow him for who it is, but they're not the country.
[28:52.220 --> 28:56.940]  We are diverse people, we are good and strong because of that, and we're going to come back
[28:56.940 --> 28:57.940]  to that.
[28:57.940 --> 28:58.940]  I assure you.
[28:58.940 --> 29:02.380]  I think the American people are starting to realize it because this president is truly
[29:02.380 --> 29:06.260]  becoming unhinged, it's affecting our national security.
[29:06.260 --> 29:08.660]  He constantly puts himself...
[29:08.660 --> 29:13.660]  Heart disease is on the rise, clogged arteries, high blood pressure and high cholesterol levels
[29:13.660 --> 29:17.460]  may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[29:17.460 --> 29:22.340]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation and irregular heartbeat are
[29:22.340 --> 29:25.860]  just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[29:25.860 --> 29:30.420]  We hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives
[29:30.420 --> 29:31.620]  across America.
[29:31.620 --> 29:35.340]  My blood pressure has normalized, my diabetes has totally improved.
[29:35.340 --> 29:39.300]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier
[29:39.300 --> 29:40.300]  I feel.
[29:40.300 --> 29:42.620]  I recommend heart and body extract to everyone.
[29:42.620 --> 29:47.820]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative
[29:47.820 --> 29:50.300]  to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[29:50.300 --> 30:01.300]  Hear your two months supply today by calling 866-295-5305 or order online hbextract.com.
[30:01.300 --> 30:31.260]  Heart and Body Extract 866-295-5305 or hbextract.com.
[30:31.260 --> 30:34.980]  When the menu comes up, you simply click add to home screen.
[30:34.980 --> 30:37.060]  It will then ask you to name the app.
[30:37.060 --> 30:39.340]  I suggest band.video.
[30:39.340 --> 30:43.940]  You will now have band.video app on your home screen, despite the fact that Tim Cook tried
[30:43.940 --> 30:44.940]  to stop it.
[30:44.940 --> 30:49.060]  The globalists think you're lazy, but by taking a little bit of action you can override them,
[30:49.060 --> 30:53.260]  have the app and then tell others about it so they can get the app.
[30:53.260 --> 30:57.260]  So it's up to you whether you want to defy big tech and click the share buttons below
[30:57.260 --> 31:01.820]  on your email, on Facebook, on Twitter, on YouTube, however you want, be sure to share
[31:57.820 --> 32:08.900]  all of them.
[32:08.900 --> 32:13.380]  I've got to really hand it to the listeners and viewers from Infowars.
[32:13.380 --> 32:19.060]  Your support and your help in rebooting Americana is a challenge to the globalist system of
[32:19.060 --> 32:20.660]  corporate tyranny.
[32:20.660 --> 32:25.180]  It has really caught hold, not just here in the US but worldwide and President Trump's
[32:25.180 --> 32:27.460]  fearlessness when it comes to promoting
[32:27.460 --> 32:31.100]  Americana and basic liberty is amazing as well.
[32:31.100 --> 32:34.140]  He's still lacking on the big tech censorship,
[32:34.140 --> 32:36.140]  taking action against that in some other areas,
[32:36.140 --> 32:38.700]  but trying to end the wars, boosting our economy,
[32:38.700 --> 32:40.820]  speaking out against communist China,
[32:40.820 --> 32:42.260]  Trump's been doing an amazing job,
[32:42.260 --> 32:44.420]  but now more than ever,
[32:44.420 --> 32:46.300]  we really have to realize that
[32:46.300 --> 32:49.580]  we're being targeted because we are effective
[32:49.580 --> 32:52.900]  and the globalists are beginning to lose their war
[32:52.900 --> 32:54.500]  against humanity in a big way.
[32:54.500 --> 32:56.900]  And so we're gonna see some major fireworks out of them,
[32:56.900 --> 33:00.140]  but it's critical to not let ourselves get down
[33:00.140 --> 33:02.660]  when we see all the poison they spray at us.
[33:02.660 --> 33:04.620]  That's an attempt to demoralize us.
[33:04.620 --> 33:07.980]  We've got to remember that and stay focused and stay happy.
[33:07.980 --> 33:25.540]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:25.540 --> 33:51.540]  All right, ladies and gentlemen,
[33:51.540 --> 33:54.860]  we are back live broadcasting worldwide.
[33:54.860 --> 33:57.900]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[33:57.900 --> 34:02.020]  Thank you for joining us on this live Monday broadcast.
[34:02.020 --> 34:05.260]  James O'Keeffe says that any minute now,
[34:05.260 --> 34:08.220]  he's gonna upload the full first installment
[34:08.220 --> 34:10.900]  of the major CNN whistleblower
[34:10.900 --> 34:14.100]  who was still inside CNN this morning,
[34:14.100 --> 34:16.260]  sending information to Project Veritas.
[34:16.260 --> 34:19.980]  Now, Paul Watson has a first look at this
[34:20.980 --> 34:22.460]  on infowars.com.
[34:22.460 --> 34:25.460]  You wanna share this and it has the live link to this show.
[34:25.460 --> 34:28.660]  James O'Keeffe will be with us here in about 25 minutes.
[34:29.580 --> 34:33.740]  Project Veritas tape features Zucker admitting CNN
[34:33.740 --> 34:37.060]  only covering Trump impeachment for ratings,
[34:37.060 --> 34:41.660]  but it goes further and personal vendetta.
[34:42.860 --> 34:44.500]  I've now been authorized to tell you that.
[34:44.500 --> 34:46.100]  I was already told that this morning,
[34:46.100 --> 34:49.020]  but O'Keeffe has now released a short little promo video
[34:49.020 --> 34:51.180]  we heard earlier just minutes ago
[34:51.180 --> 34:55.740]  where it's quoting that personal vendetta.
[34:55.740 --> 34:57.980]  And again, I knew this over the last few days
[34:57.980 --> 34:59.860]  and I learned more this morning,
[34:59.860 --> 35:04.780]  but Paul's got a lot of this in the article infowars.com.
[35:05.860 --> 35:06.960]  Here's what's exciting.
[35:08.940 --> 35:13.060]  There are millions of people watching O'Keeffe right now,
[35:13.060 --> 35:16.460]  millions, ladies and gentlemen, and millions on Twitter.
[35:16.460 --> 35:17.900]  Twitter is doing everything they can
[35:17.900 --> 35:21.060]  to stop hashtag expose CNN.
[35:21.060 --> 35:24.660]  So we haven't even released the story yet.
[35:24.660 --> 35:27.500]  What are you going to do tomorrow when we do, Jack?
[35:27.500 --> 35:28.940]  That was last night.
[35:28.940 --> 35:30.700]  We know at Twitter will shadow band
[35:30.700 --> 35:34.580]  the hashtag expose CNN story we are dropping tomorrow.
[35:34.580 --> 35:36.620]  That's only 50,000 people who are willing to help us
[35:36.620 --> 35:38.540]  share the direct link, the story launch,
[35:38.540 --> 35:39.940]  and they're doing it.
[35:39.940 --> 35:43.100]  Wow, 100,000 tweets, hashtag expose CNN,
[35:43.100 --> 35:44.860]  and still not the number one trend.
[35:44.860 --> 35:46.900]  Guess we have to hit a million, huh, Jack?
[35:46.900 --> 35:48.660]  No, a trillion won't do it,
[35:48.660 --> 35:52.060]  but it's still all getting out there.
[35:52.060 --> 35:53.700]  This is beautiful, it's happening.
[35:53.700 --> 35:56.620]  Hit them with infowars as well, folks, and news wars.
[35:56.620 --> 36:00.180]  And remember, you can also hit them with band.video.
[36:00.180 --> 36:02.300]  Go to band.video, starting now,
[36:03.460 --> 36:08.460]  and then just say live coverage of the CNN whistleblower
[36:08.460 --> 36:11.700]  at band.video, where we'll have our own video feeds
[36:11.700 --> 36:13.580]  because they a lot of times take down the feeds
[36:13.580 --> 36:16.060]  on Twitter and YouTube, as you know.
[36:16.060 --> 36:17.500]  You go to the live feeds,
[36:17.500 --> 36:20.420]  go to band.video, and you click up in the left-hand corner,
[36:20.420 --> 36:21.380]  the three bars right there,
[36:21.380 --> 36:23.460]  we'll do that on there for folks.
[36:23.460 --> 36:25.700]  You go to the Alex Jones page,
[36:25.700 --> 36:30.700]  and you can see the Alex Jones show live feed right there.
[36:31.540 --> 36:32.780]  And we're also gonna have it soon
[36:32.780 --> 36:36.180]  where whatever is live pops up in a banner right at the top
[36:36.180 --> 36:38.540]  or pops up in the corner, right-hand corner,
[36:38.540 --> 36:41.500]  so people can find the live feed even easier.
[36:41.500 --> 36:44.140]  But we're gonna tweet that out, band.video,
[36:45.020 --> 36:46.220]  and then you go to the right-hand corner,
[36:46.220 --> 36:47.820]  you find the Alex Jones show,
[36:47.820 --> 36:48.660]  and that's the live feed.
[36:48.660 --> 36:50.340]  You go to infowars.com,
[36:50.340 --> 36:53.580]  and you can see the Global Bombshell headline there,
[36:53.580 --> 36:56.860]  Project Veritas secretly was able
[36:56.860 --> 36:59.060]  to get recordings of Zuckerberg,
[36:59.060 --> 37:02.260]  and it's just simply amazing.
[37:02.260 --> 37:05.940]  Before we play the latest little two-minute video
[37:05.940 --> 37:08.900]  that they put out before the full one gets released,
[37:08.900 --> 37:11.340]  and then O'Keeffe said to join us next hour,
[37:11.340 --> 37:16.340]  I'd like to introduce the CNN whistleblower, Kerry Porsch,
[37:18.180 --> 37:19.700]  is how you pronounce it,
[37:19.700 --> 37:22.300]  who secretly recorded his colleagues for months.
[37:23.780 --> 37:26.620]  We'll be uploading clips all day and night, says Porsch.
[37:26.620 --> 37:29.340]  I didn't see any other option.
[37:29.340 --> 37:32.900]  I decided to wear a hidden camera to expose the bias,
[37:32.900 --> 37:37.900]  and there he is with Wolf Blitzer and all the rest of them.
[37:38.140 --> 37:41.060]  They recorded the CEO of CNN saying
[37:41.060 --> 37:42.300]  all of this, you know,
[37:42.300 --> 37:45.860]  the globalists are going for broke, ladies and gentlemen.
[37:45.860 --> 37:47.220]  And I've said over and over again,
[37:47.220 --> 37:49.220]  the number one thing we can do
[37:50.300 --> 37:52.380]  is when you see corruption inside organizations
[37:52.380 --> 37:53.980]  or inside institutions,
[37:53.980 --> 37:56.260]  either tell independent media about it,
[37:56.260 --> 37:59.140]  or create your own channel somewhere,
[37:59.140 --> 38:01.380]  and get the information out that way,
[38:01.380 --> 38:03.700]  or send us the information.
[38:03.700 --> 38:06.140]  And James O'Keeffe always comes on our show
[38:06.140 --> 38:06.980]  as one of the first,
[38:06.980 --> 38:08.580]  because he appreciates you.
[38:08.580 --> 38:09.940]  He appreciates infowars.
[38:09.940 --> 38:13.180]  Upwards of half or more of their tipsters
[38:13.180 --> 38:14.540]  and the folks that they bring forward
[38:14.540 --> 38:16.620]  that have exposed big tech, everything,
[38:16.620 --> 38:19.740]  came to them via infowars.
[38:19.740 --> 38:20.660]  Because we're on every day.
[38:20.660 --> 38:22.540]  James O'Keeffe, you know, is releasing videos
[38:22.540 --> 38:24.420]  maybe once a month or so and they're amazing,
[38:24.420 --> 38:26.340]  but we're on every day.
[38:26.340 --> 38:28.700]  And so we've had some big whistleblowers here as well,
[38:28.700 --> 38:30.540]  but I'm not in competition with Veritas.
[38:30.540 --> 38:32.940]  I feel good when I lay my head down at night
[38:32.940 --> 38:35.740]  knowing that James O'Keeffe and his team is out there.
[38:35.740 --> 38:38.820]  That's what's so exciting and so important about all of this.
[38:38.820 --> 38:40.500]  So this is all a team effort, folks.
[38:40.500 --> 38:45.020]  So band.video, go up to the left-hand corner
[38:45.020 --> 38:46.340]  where you see three bars, click it.
[38:46.340 --> 38:47.860]  You see the Alex Jones show?
[38:47.860 --> 38:49.060]  Click right there.
[38:49.060 --> 38:50.940]  And there is the live feed right there,
[38:50.940 --> 38:55.140]  or go to infowars.com.
[38:55.140 --> 38:59.740]  And we have a headline up there for the live show today,
[39:01.740 --> 39:04.260]  which has the feed of it, which again, you can share.
[39:04.260 --> 39:06.380]  And this is the chain reaction
[39:06.380 --> 39:10.100]  that will bring down the globalist.
[39:10.100 --> 39:13.460]  Live updates, Veritas bombshell exclusive,
[39:13.460 --> 39:17.580]  CNN CEO Jeff Zucker and others caught on hundreds of hours
[39:17.580 --> 39:18.660]  of tape.
[39:18.660 --> 39:20.700]  James O'Keeffe will be joining Alex Jones live on air
[39:20.700 --> 39:24.020]  at noon central to break down what is obviously,
[39:24.020 --> 39:29.260]  and undoubtedly the biggest story ever released by Veritas.
[39:29.260 --> 39:34.020]  And this could bring down their entire system,
[39:34.020 --> 39:37.100]  ladies and gentlemen.
[39:37.100 --> 39:39.380]  So again, there is the article right there
[39:39.380 --> 39:44.140]  that's very critical for everyone to share.
[39:44.140 --> 39:46.980]  I cannot stress enough to you.
[39:46.980 --> 39:50.300]  Now, infowars.com gets blocked a lot on Twitter
[39:50.300 --> 39:51.220]  and Facebook and YouTube.
[39:51.220 --> 39:54.100]  But if you go to newswars.com, the exact same article
[39:54.100 --> 39:56.300]  and feed is at newswars.com.
[39:56.300 --> 39:59.940]  And it's very, very easy to share.
[39:59.940 --> 40:03.500]  Very, very easy for you to get it.
[40:03.500 --> 40:05.340]  And there's not the blacklisting of it.
[40:05.340 --> 40:06.660]  Same thing for band.video.
[40:06.660 --> 40:08.820]  It hasn't gotten into their blacklist yet.
[40:08.820 --> 40:12.100]  Infowars is like putting something out into a black hole.
[40:12.100 --> 40:14.220]  The word of mouth, infowars, it's best
[40:14.220 --> 40:16.260]  to give out infowars word of mouth.
[40:16.260 --> 40:19.220]  Because infowars word of mouth, people know about it.
[40:19.220 --> 40:20.860]  And they go, oh, yeah, I'm not supposed to see that.
[40:20.860 --> 40:22.540]  I'm not supposed to listen to that and say, yeah.
[40:22.540 --> 40:23.620]  infowars.com.forge.
[40:23.620 --> 40:25.900]  So I show again, I'm going to get to all the news here.
[40:25.900 --> 40:28.700]  But right now it's about maximum effort
[40:28.700 --> 40:31.980]  with your human intelligence, your human action.
[40:31.980 --> 40:32.860]  We're going to go to break.
[40:32.860 --> 40:36.060]  And I want to go out to break with a two minute teaser
[40:36.060 --> 40:38.540]  he just put out about 15 minutes ago.
[40:38.540 --> 40:41.100]  And then again, as soon as it goes live,
[40:41.100 --> 40:44.380]  we will play it here on air.
[40:44.380 --> 40:45.740]  I have a feeling it's going to go live right
[40:45.740 --> 40:46.780]  when James will keep joining us.
[40:46.780 --> 40:48.980]  So that'll just be, we'll have them live.
[40:48.980 --> 40:51.420]  And then it'll be posted to infowars.com.
[40:51.420 --> 40:56.420]  And again, to their special CNN site, exposecnn.com.
[40:57.020 --> 41:00.500]  But this is really scaring them as more and more people
[41:00.500 --> 41:03.100]  do this when they recognize the bullying,
[41:03.100 --> 41:05.420]  the tyranny, the oppression,
[41:05.420 --> 41:06.660]  and the fact that they think they're invincible.
[41:06.660 --> 41:07.500]  Here's the clip.
[41:08.580 --> 41:09.420]  Hey there, man.
[41:09.420 --> 41:10.260]  How are you everybody?
[41:10.260 --> 41:12.500]  Okay, let's start with Washington, please.
[41:12.500 --> 41:14.620]  I don't care about the OSMPC event.
[41:14.620 --> 41:16.220]  Okay, but I don't care about them.
[41:16.220 --> 41:19.260]  Let's just stay very focused on impeachment.
[41:19.260 --> 41:20.500]  My name is Cary Porch.
[41:20.500 --> 41:22.540]  I'm a satellite uplink technician.
[41:22.540 --> 41:26.020]  I'm a contractor at the CNN Washington DC Bureau.
[41:26.020 --> 41:31.020]  But Jeff Zucker, yeah, basically president of CNN,
[41:35.300 --> 41:38.500]  has a personal vendetta against Trump.
[41:38.500 --> 41:40.420]  He's not going to be positive for Trump.
[41:40.420 --> 41:41.260]  He hates it.
[41:41.260 --> 41:42.780]  He's going to be negative.
[41:42.780 --> 41:44.860]  I decided to wear a hidden camera.
[41:44.860 --> 41:46.860]  Tomorrow, I'm going to be rid of that.
[41:46.860 --> 41:50.060]  So I'm going to get people to play in a simple way.
[41:50.060 --> 41:51.220]  Yeah.
[41:51.220 --> 41:53.340]  You're immediate rid of the trouble, Tina.
[41:53.340 --> 41:55.540]  I decided to secretly record the 9 a.m.
[41:55.540 --> 41:57.420]  and run down call meetings.
[41:57.420 --> 41:59.220]  And it's basically run by Jeff Zucker,
[41:59.220 --> 42:00.540]  the president of CNN.
[42:00.540 --> 42:03.580]  So we're moving towards impeachment.
[42:03.580 --> 42:05.900]  I mean, don't, like, you know,
[42:05.900 --> 42:09.220]  we should present, oh, this is going the one way.
[42:09.220 --> 42:14.220]  And so all these moves are moved towards impeachment.
[42:15.340 --> 42:17.020]  When I came to work at CNN,
[42:17.020 --> 42:18.780]  I mean, it was my dream job.
[42:18.780 --> 42:21.420]  And that dream actually just turned into a nightmare.
[42:21.420 --> 42:23.260]  So I thought you wanted to have your men's funeral
[42:23.260 --> 42:25.700]  and run. I know there's a lot of people at CNN
[42:25.700 --> 42:26.860]  that are friendly with the print.
[42:26.860 --> 42:28.340]  Time to stop that off.
[42:28.340 --> 42:30.060]  And it's time to call them out.
[42:30.060 --> 42:32.900]  Then I think what's going on in America now
[42:32.900 --> 42:36.180]  is really fundamentally the result
[42:36.180 --> 42:41.180]  of the years of fake news, conspiracy nonsense
[42:43.100 --> 42:45.020]  from fake news, from Fox News.
[42:45.020 --> 42:46.820]  He was calling Fox News, fake news,
[42:46.820 --> 42:48.500]  and a propaganda machine.
[42:48.500 --> 42:49.900]  And with what I saw, I'm like,
[42:49.900 --> 42:51.540]  that's pretty much what CNN was.
[42:51.540 --> 42:54.100]  Like, it's just pumping out propaganda.
[42:54.100 --> 42:59.100]  The fake conspiracy nonsense that Fox has spread
[42:59.340 --> 43:04.340]  for years is now deeply embedded in American society.
[43:05.140 --> 43:06.380]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[43:06.380 --> 43:07.220]  Stay with us.
[43:08.420 --> 43:10.740]  Globalism was doomed to fail
[43:10.740 --> 43:14.180]  if we just exposed it and then resisted it.
[43:14.180 --> 43:16.380]  Didn't I say a thousand times
[43:16.380 --> 43:18.460]  that there's no way you're gonna have an authoritarian
[43:18.460 --> 43:20.060]  corporate world government above the law
[43:20.060 --> 43:22.780]  that doesn't pay taxes, that has diplomatic immunity,
[43:22.780 --> 43:25.380]  that runs around saying it's communists and socialists
[43:25.380 --> 43:26.580]  power to the people,
[43:26.580 --> 43:28.940]  but then meanwhile is tax exempt again offshore.
[43:28.940 --> 43:30.620]  Well, Trump got that.
[43:30.620 --> 43:32.540]  And all these other populists get it.
[43:32.540 --> 43:34.020]  Why would you throw away wealthy,
[43:34.020 --> 43:35.780]  successful countries and cultures
[43:35.780 --> 43:38.260]  just so you could say the communist Chinese
[43:38.260 --> 43:40.140]  that David Rockefeller put in power
[43:40.140 --> 43:41.620]  are better than everybody?
[43:41.620 --> 43:44.380]  That is a sick freakish joke.
[43:44.380 --> 43:47.060]  And I will not stand by and watch humanity
[43:47.060 --> 43:48.180]  turn over to these people.
[43:48.180 --> 43:51.300]  And I beg God for the strength and the will
[43:51.300 --> 43:54.820]  to have the discernment to help be part of their defeat.
[43:54.820 --> 43:57.020]  And I've been saying that prayer for 20 plus years
[43:57.020 --> 43:59.940]  and God is delivering because God is great.
[43:59.940 --> 44:02.260]  Thank God for his son, Jesus Christ.
[44:02.260 --> 44:05.180]  And now let's move forward against the NW.
[44:08.180 --> 44:10.980]  Silicon Valley thinks you're a dumb jellyfish.
[44:10.980 --> 44:12.940]  They think the West is dead.
[44:12.940 --> 44:15.060]  They think if they censor nationalists and patriots
[44:15.060 --> 44:16.500]  off the internet, you'll just forget about us.
[44:16.500 --> 44:18.340]  And then they'll be the only information out there.
[44:18.340 --> 44:20.860]  Well, so far, that's not been working too well for them.
[44:20.860 --> 44:23.740]  Thanks to you spreading the word steadfastly
[44:23.740 --> 44:26.340]  that the resistance to globalism is alive and well
[44:26.340 --> 44:27.740]  at band.video.
[44:27.740 --> 44:29.700]  And now we've added a lot of new functions

[44:47.780 --> 44:50.060]  on your phone and then add to home screen
[44:50.060 --> 44:52.220]  and then there's nothing the scumbags can do.
[44:52.220 --> 44:55.060]  The power of America, the power of freedom,
[44:55.060 --> 44:58.220]  the power to build a better world and stand in the face
[44:58.220 --> 45:01.580]  of the censors of the tyrants is alive and stronger
[45:01.580 --> 45:03.380]  than ever at band.video.
[45:03.380 --> 45:06.540]  But it's up to you to unleash its full potential.
[45:06.540 --> 45:08.100]  Band.video.

[45:14.060 --> 45:17.620]  But we've successfully been able to do it.

[46:09.100 --> 46:13.020]  I don't sell things, I don't promote things
[46:13.020 --> 46:15.620]  unless I know they get big results.
[46:15.620 --> 46:18.500]  You go out, you wear an m4store.com shirt,

[46:22.620 --> 46:25.580]  you might meet somebody that gives you incredible information.
[46:25.580 --> 46:28.620]  You also might get shot or hit in the head with a bike lock
[46:28.620 --> 46:29.900]  by an antiveterrest.
[46:29.900 --> 46:32.580]  Let me tell you, that's big results.
[46:32.580 --> 46:35.340]  Yeah, we're not in Kansas anymore as I like to say.

[47:36.580 --> 47:39.580]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live.
[47:39.580 --> 47:42.580]  And I have never had this much news to cover.
[47:42.580 --> 47:44.580]  It's just totally insane.
[47:44.580 --> 47:47.580]  James O'Keefe joining us start of the next hour.
[47:47.580 --> 47:49.580]  Still, they haven't released the full bombshell.
[47:49.580 --> 47:52.580]  They've released some huge clips that are massive.
[47:52.580 --> 47:56.580]  Zuckerberg, Zooker.
[47:56.580 --> 47:58.580]  I get those two confused.
[47:58.580 --> 48:00.580]  One's the head of Facebook.
[48:00.580 --> 48:05.580]  Going after our freedoms, Mark Zuckerberg, the others, Jeff Zucker.
[48:05.580 --> 48:07.580]  I'm teleprompter free.
[48:07.580 --> 48:12.580]  The head of CNN with a personal vendetta against Trump.
[48:12.580 --> 48:14.580]  Saying everything is about impeachment,
[48:14.580 --> 48:20.580]  even though they know it's not going anywhere for ratings.
[48:20.580 --> 48:23.580]  And so much more, hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds
[48:23.580 --> 48:25.580]  of thousands of dollars.
[48:25.580 --> 48:34.580]  And it's all coming out.
[48:34.580 --> 48:36.580]  That is so huge.
[48:36.580 --> 48:41.580]  Meanwhile, just as big this weekend, I saw the article.
[48:41.580 --> 48:45.580]  Man arrested and his guns taken in a Washington state.
[48:45.580 --> 48:53.580]  And I went and found the meme of a Joker meme saying one ticket for Joker.
[48:53.580 --> 49:00.580]  So that means, oh, if it's a man who's only getting one ticket,
[49:00.580 --> 49:05.580]  meaning he's not taking a girl, that means he's an incel.
[49:05.580 --> 49:08.580]  So he didn't say I'm going to Joker to shoot people.
[49:08.580 --> 49:10.580]  He did something esoteric.
[49:10.580 --> 49:17.580]  They claim symbolizes and means that and was obviously done as a joke.
[49:17.580 --> 49:19.580]  Now they could have gone by and talked to him,
[49:19.580 --> 49:25.580]  but one ticket to the Joker, please, in a black incel type outfit,
[49:25.580 --> 49:29.580]  had his guns taken.
[49:29.580 --> 49:30.580]  No due process.
[49:30.580 --> 49:32.580]  Even the ACLU has come out.
[49:32.580 --> 49:33.580]  It's on infowars.com.
[49:33.580 --> 49:34.580]  This just broke.
[49:34.580 --> 49:41.580]  California new red flag law deemed threat to civil liberties by ACLU.
[49:41.580 --> 49:45.580]  Everywhere due process is being taken away, including for the president
[49:45.580 --> 49:48.580]  where the Democrats are having kangaroo court hearings
[49:48.580 --> 49:51.580]  and are saying they're going to have evidence from whistleblowers
[49:51.580 --> 49:56.580]  without their identity being known by anybody except Democrat chairman.
[49:56.580 --> 50:02.580]  That's a kangaroo court beyond kangaroo court.
[50:02.580 --> 50:06.580]  Because the left and the big corporations have decided to bring us into line
[50:06.580 --> 50:10.580]  with globalism where there is no due process for the average person.
[50:10.580 --> 50:13.580]  Unless you're a globalist, corporate stakeholder,
[50:13.580 --> 50:15.580]  or a member of the Communist Party of China,
[50:15.580 --> 50:17.580]  you don't have any rights in this new world order.
[50:17.580 --> 50:19.580]  It's the new feudalism.
[50:19.580 --> 50:20.580]  They're the new royalty.
[50:20.580 --> 50:25.580]  And the attorney general came out in a long speech he gave.
[50:25.580 --> 50:27.580]  It's up on infowars.com.
[50:27.580 --> 50:34.580]  AG Bill Barr flames unremitting assault on religion traditional values
[50:34.580 --> 50:36.580]  during Notre Dame visit.
[50:36.580 --> 50:37.580]  But he went further.
[50:37.580 --> 50:38.580]  This is the key statement.
[50:38.580 --> 50:39.580]  This is not decay.
[50:39.580 --> 50:42.580]  This is organized destruction.
[50:42.580 --> 50:45.580]  He then goes into the sexualization of children
[50:45.580 --> 50:48.580]  and forcing elementary school students to be taught about LGBT.
[50:48.580 --> 50:51.580]  Elementary students aren't thinking about sex, period.
[50:51.580 --> 50:56.580]  Any adult trying to talk to him about that is a pedophile or a pedophile pusher.
[50:56.580 --> 50:58.580]  And that's what that is.
[50:58.580 --> 51:01.580]  They're trying to confuse and screw kids up.
[51:01.580 --> 51:05.580]  Most of the kids that are, quote, trans are autistic or retarded.
[51:05.580 --> 51:07.580]  Don't call them retarded.
[51:07.580 --> 51:08.580]  Just chop their balls off.
[51:08.580 --> 51:10.580]  That's how the left works.
[51:10.580 --> 51:14.580]  It's like apocalypse now.
[51:14.580 --> 51:22.580]  I guess written by the great Millis where Colonel Kurtz is talking.
[51:22.580 --> 51:30.580]  And he says we order our airmen to drop firebombs and napalm on children.
[51:30.580 --> 51:34.580]  But then we court-martial them if they write cuss words on the side of the airplane.
[51:34.580 --> 51:36.580]  See how that works?
[51:36.580 --> 51:40.580]  Don't say they're targeting mentally retarded children because, oh, we say that word's hurtful.
[51:40.580 --> 51:42.580]  That's just the technical term.
[51:42.580 --> 51:46.580]  But let's target them and go, hey, you're really cool.
[51:46.580 --> 51:50.580]  Let's give you some hormones that have killed 6,000 people in just the last couple years.
[51:50.580 --> 51:57.580]  Let's induct you into the local, quote, gay bar where you dance scantily clad when you're 11 years old.
[51:57.580 --> 52:00.580]  It's pedophilia.
[52:00.580 --> 52:08.580]  So that's all coming up.
[52:08.580 --> 52:16.580]  Meanwhile, we're watching Venezuela collapse into something like the Road Warrior.
[52:16.580 --> 52:20.580]  Not civilization, but a literal hell run by warlords.
[52:20.580 --> 52:24.580]  And you know that's where we're headed, just like Mexico.
[52:24.580 --> 52:29.580]  But here is the Attorney General just laying out some of this.
[52:29.580 --> 52:33.580]  Here's a few of these excerpts.
[52:33.580 --> 52:41.580]  Among the militant secularists are many so-called progressives, but where is the progress?
[52:41.580 --> 52:49.580]  We are told we are living in a post-Christian era, but what has replaced the Judeo-Christian moral system?
[52:49.580 --> 52:55.580]  What is it that can fill the spiritual void in the hearts of the individual person?
[52:55.580 --> 53:02.580]  And what is the system of values that can sustain human social life?
[53:02.580 --> 53:08.580]  The fact is that no secular creed has emerged capable of performing the role of religion.
[53:08.580 --> 53:13.580]  This is not decay, this is organized destruction.
[53:13.580 --> 53:21.580]  Secularists and their allies have marshaled all the forces of mass communication, popular culture,
[53:21.580 --> 53:28.580]  the entertainment industry, and academia in an unremitting assault on religion and traditional values.
[53:28.580 --> 53:36.580]  There is no consensus about the centrality of religious liberty in the United States.
[53:36.580 --> 53:44.580]  The imperative of protecting religious freedom was not just a nod in the direction of piety.
[53:44.580 --> 53:54.580]  It reflects the framers' belief that religion was indispensable to sustaining our free system of government.
[53:54.580 --> 54:01.580]  In his renowned 1785 pamphlet, Memorial and Remonstrance Against Religious Assessments,
[54:01.580 --> 54:10.580]  James Madison described religious liberty as a right towards men, but a duty towards the creator,
[54:10.580 --> 54:19.580]  and a duty perceived both in order of time and degree of obligation to the claims of civil society.
[54:19.580 --> 54:24.580]  I've been on air a long time, 25 years, and I don't get butterflies a lot, at least in the past.
[54:24.580 --> 54:26.580]  Now I get them all the time.
[54:26.580 --> 54:28.580]  And talk about edge of your seat.
[54:28.580 --> 54:34.580]  People get excited if their football team is in sudden death overtime or whatever, or their basketball teams in the finals.
[54:34.580 --> 54:38.580]  Daria is out there talking to O'Keeffe right now on the phone, and I'm just like,
[54:38.580 --> 54:42.580]  pins and needles when he comes on next hour, and O'Keeffe hasn't uploaded the big report yet.
[54:42.580 --> 54:45.580]  I think he's teasing it on purpose, he's learned how to do that.
[54:45.580 --> 54:48.580]  It's going viral everywhere, the anticipation.
[54:48.580 --> 54:49.580]  We're going to have it here.
[54:49.580 --> 54:50.580]  We've got live feeds of it.
[54:50.580 --> 54:53.580]  O'Keeffe, infowars.com, forward slash show.
[54:53.580 --> 54:57.580]  This is a great way for you to get infowars out to new people to say,
[54:57.580 --> 54:59.580]  hey, Project Veritas has their biggest story ever.
[54:59.580 --> 55:02.580]  This could bring down CNN, I'm told.
[55:02.580 --> 55:05.580]  And O'Keeffe doesn't exaggerate things.
[55:05.580 --> 55:07.580]  He tends to play things down.
[55:07.580 --> 55:10.580]  I mean, they brought down Acorn.
[55:10.580 --> 55:12.580]  They wanted to run child prostitution.
[55:12.580 --> 55:13.580]  They exposed that.
[55:13.580 --> 55:15.580]  It's always the same thing.
[55:15.580 --> 55:17.580]  They brought down so many globalists.
[55:17.580 --> 55:20.580]  I mean, they've broken so many huge, massive stories.
[55:20.580 --> 55:24.580]  Big tech specifically, Twitter, Facebook, Google, targeting infowars,
[55:24.580 --> 55:28.580]  and quote veterans, and quote anybody promoting American flags.
[55:28.580 --> 55:31.580]  Like, who do the CEO tell you we're targeting?
[55:31.580 --> 55:34.580]  Well, people like Alex Jones, he's our main enemy.
[55:34.580 --> 55:41.580]  And then veterans groups and pro-Trump groups and, well, rednecks with American flags.
[55:41.580 --> 55:43.580]  Give an American flag on your site.
[55:43.580 --> 55:45.580]  We just banned you on Twitter.
[55:45.580 --> 55:48.580]  And then these dumb hicks think they're talking to people,
[55:48.580 --> 55:52.580]  but never, you know, wonder why nobody talks to them.
[55:52.580 --> 55:57.580]  And again, what that is is a very anti-white attitude.
[55:57.580 --> 55:59.580]  Very bigoted, and you've got white CEOs and people,
[55:59.580 --> 56:04.580]  but they hire minorities that have been indoctrinated to hate white people.
[56:04.580 --> 56:06.580]  And you see that everywhere.
[56:06.580 --> 56:10.580]  These city council meetings where the mayor goes, shut up to the man.
[56:10.580 --> 56:11.580]  You're a white male.
[56:11.580 --> 56:12.580]  Shut your mouth.
[56:12.580 --> 56:14.580]  You don't get to speak.
[56:14.580 --> 56:17.580]  He's like, well, I'm elected and you're saying white people are inherently bad
[56:17.580 --> 56:18.580]  and that's racist.
[56:18.580 --> 56:19.580]  Shut up.
[56:19.580 --> 56:21.580]  Shut up.
[56:21.580 --> 56:23.580]  He goes, OK, I shut up.
[56:23.580 --> 56:24.580]  I wouldn't shut up to that.
[56:24.580 --> 56:26.580]  That woman needs to be removed.
[56:26.580 --> 56:27.580]  I played that last week.
[56:27.580 --> 56:31.580]  That's in a major city of Illinois.
[56:31.580 --> 56:34.580]  We're going to go to break.
[56:34.580 --> 56:38.580]  I'm just absolutely overwhelmed, but this is an insane time.
[56:38.580 --> 56:40.580]  Bottom line, there's a revolution against America taking place
[56:40.580 --> 56:42.580]  and against the family.
[56:42.580 --> 56:43.580]  We're being conquered.
[56:43.580 --> 56:46.580]  It's a premeditated evil takeover.
[56:46.580 --> 56:48.580]  The attorney general just told you that.
[56:48.580 --> 56:49.580]  It's a premeditated evil takeover.
[56:49.580 --> 56:50.580]  You got to read the whole transcript.
[56:50.580 --> 56:51.580]  We're going to air it.
[56:51.580 --> 56:52.580]  He says they're going after our kids.
[56:52.580 --> 56:54.580]  They're sexualizing our kids.
[56:54.580 --> 56:56.580]  We're going to play some of this.
[56:56.580 --> 57:00.580]  It's a long speech, but we're getting the best excerpts for the third hour.
[57:00.580 --> 57:01.580]  I have open phones today.
[57:01.580 --> 57:02.580]  James O'Keeffe's coming up.
[57:02.580 --> 57:06.580]  Tell everybody right now, listening on AM and FM about that local station,
[57:06.580 --> 57:08.580]  because they're fighting to keep us from being heard
[57:08.580 --> 57:11.580]  because we've got the evidence about criminal they are.
[57:11.580 --> 57:16.580]  And we need this Veritas info that's at man.video in the live feed to go viral.
[57:16.580 --> 57:21.580]  Separately, we're running the everything must go super sale to fund ourselves going into next year.
[57:21.580 --> 57:23.580]  It's the biggest sale really ever.
[57:23.580 --> 57:26.580]  The last sale was the biggest since Christmas, but on many select items,
[57:26.580 --> 57:28.580]  we've never gone 70% off.
[57:28.580 --> 57:32.580]  Many of these are at cost because I need to sell out of all the inventory
[57:32.580 --> 57:34.580]  to be able to buy the inventory we're going to have for next year.
[57:34.580 --> 57:36.580]  We're not going to have as big an inventory next year.
[57:36.580 --> 57:39.580]  I put out like 60 something products and they're all awesome,
[57:39.580 --> 57:41.580]  but some of them I never even got around to promoting.
[57:41.580 --> 57:42.580]  So we're just selling these things out.
[57:42.580 --> 57:43.580]  Many of them at cost.
[57:43.580 --> 57:45.580]  So thank you all for your support.
[57:45.580 --> 57:49.580]  infowarstore.com or triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine.
[57:49.580 --> 57:52.580]  But even the best sellers are all 50% off.
[57:52.580 --> 57:57.580]  Storewide free shipping, double patriot points infowarstore.com.
[57:57.580 --> 58:00.580]  Now is the critical time to keep info wars on the air.
[58:00.580 --> 58:04.580]  Everything we've warned of is now being exposed and is out in the open.
[58:04.580 --> 58:07.580]  Want to be clear, it's not coming true.
[58:07.580 --> 58:09.580]  It was already true.
[58:09.580 --> 58:11.580]  I didn't predict all this.
[58:11.580 --> 58:12.580]  It was already going on.
[58:12.580 --> 58:15.580]  Now the globalists are making their move with the chai comms.
[58:15.580 --> 58:16.580]  So it's naked.
[58:16.580 --> 58:17.580]  It's brazen.
[58:17.580 --> 58:20.580]  This is the point when the enemy emerges.
[58:20.580 --> 58:24.580]  It's like before world war two, the polls kept warning that Nazi Germany was going to attack them.
[58:24.580 --> 58:29.580]  Nobody believed them as they saw the troops massing until it finally happened.
[58:29.580 --> 58:33.580]  We're at that same point and we're all Paul Revere's who need to be out there
[58:33.580 --> 58:37.580]  warning everyone about what's unfolding because this is the critical fight.
[58:37.580 --> 58:43.580]  And thank God America and the world is waking up at the 11th hour 58 minute.
[58:43.580 --> 58:45.580]  But will it be too little too late?
[58:45.580 --> 58:46.580]  That's up to you.
[58:46.580 --> 58:47.580]  This battle is hot.
[58:47.580 --> 58:48.580]  It's real.
[58:48.580 --> 58:52.580]  So spread the word and support info wars today at infowarstore.com.
[58:52.580 --> 58:58.580]  But whatever you do, spread the word about the live transmission.
[58:58.580 --> 59:03.580]  I've got to really hand it to the listeners and viewers from info wars.
[59:03.580 --> 59:09.580]  Your support and your help in rebooting Americana is a challenge to the globalist system of
[59:09.580 --> 59:13.580]  corporate tyranny has really caught hold, not just here in the U.S. worldwide.
[59:13.580 --> 59:19.580]  And President Trump's fearlessness when it comes to promoting Americana and basic liberty
[59:19.580 --> 59:20.580]  is amazing as well.
[59:20.580 --> 59:26.580]  He's still lacking on the big tech censorship, taking action against that in some other areas.
[59:26.580 --> 59:30.580]  Trying to end the wars, boosting our economy, speaking out against communist China.
[59:30.580 --> 59:32.580]  Trump's been doing an amazing job.
[59:32.580 --> 59:39.580]  But now more than ever, we really have to realize that we're being targeted because we are effective.
[59:39.580 --> 59:44.580]  And the globalists are beginning to lose their war against humanity in a big way.
[59:44.580 --> 59:46.580]  And so we're going to see some major fireworks out of them.
[59:46.580 --> 59:52.580]  But it's critical to not let ourselves get down when we see all the poison they spray at us.
[59:52.580 --> 59:54.580]  That's an attempt to demoralize us.
[59:54.580 --> 59:58.580]  We've got to remember that and stay focused and stay happy.
[1:00:24.580 --> 1:00:33.580]  Three of the 10 deadliest shootings in American history in our 240-year history have come in the last five months.
[1:00:33.580 --> 1:00:35.580]  Let me say that again.
[1:00:35.580 --> 1:00:43.580]  Three of the 10 deadliest shootings in American history have come in the last five months.
[1:00:43.580 --> 1:00:46.580]  Mika, we are in the midst of an epidemic.
[1:00:46.580 --> 1:00:58.580]  Newsom gave teeth to a red flag law that now allows coworkers, employers and educators to file for gun violence restraining orders that last up to five years against gun owners.
[1:00:58.580 --> 1:01:01.580]  They deem a danger to themselves and others.
[1:01:01.580 --> 1:01:07.580]  The same legislation was vetoed twice by former ultra-progressive Governor Jerry Brown.
[1:01:07.580 --> 1:01:14.580]  Newsom's legislation also gives judges the ability to issue search warrants as they grant the orders.
[1:01:14.580 --> 1:01:23.580]  Meaning if a gun owner is served with a relinquishment order but fails to turn over the firearms or ammunition, the warrant can be activated immediately.
[1:01:23.580 --> 1:01:35.580]  Fox News reported the ACLU says the bill poses a significant threat to civil liberties because a restraining order can be sought before a gun owner has an opportunity to dispute the request.
[1:01:35.580 --> 1:01:44.580]  Additionally, those making a request under the new law may lack the relationship or skills required to make an appropriate assessment.
[1:01:44.580 --> 1:01:49.580]  Newsom went on to boast that California has outperformed the rest of the nation.
[1:01:49.580 --> 1:02:01.580]  California has outperformed the rest of the nation because of our gun safety laws in reducing the gun murder rate substantially compared to the national reduction.
[1:02:01.580 --> 1:02:08.580]  Let me be specific and precise. Between 1993 and 2017, these are the latest numbers we have.
[1:02:08.580 --> 1:02:10.580]  We'll get the 18 members in shortly.
[1:02:10.580 --> 1:02:17.580]  There's been a 62% decline in the gun murder rate in the state of California compared to just 34% nationwide.
[1:02:17.580 --> 1:02:22.580]  That's because of the leadership of the state in gun safety laws.
[1:02:22.580 --> 1:02:29.580]  No state does it as well or comprehensively as the state of California, and we still have a long way to go.
[1:02:29.580 --> 1:02:33.580]  But is it due to Newsom's unconstitutional tyranny?
[1:02:33.580 --> 1:02:39.580]  In Texas, where you can take a handgun to your college class, gun regulations have been rolled back.
[1:02:39.580 --> 1:02:45.580]  Yet its gun homicide rate has plummeted 61% in the last quarter century.
[1:02:45.580 --> 1:02:55.580]  Democratic Assemblyman Phil Ting of San Francisco, who authored the bill, claimed a study found that gun restraining order laws may have helped prevent 21 mass shootings.
[1:02:55.580 --> 1:03:02.580]  Yet the UC Davis researchers warned that it's impossible to know whether violence would have occurred.
[1:03:02.580 --> 1:03:10.580]  Ting also authored a companion bill that would allow gun owners who are the subjects of restraining order requests to file a form with the court,
[1:03:10.580 --> 1:03:16.580]  declaring that they won't contest the request and are surrendering their firearms.
[1:03:16.580 --> 1:03:22.580]  Currently, even those who agree to give up their guns must go through a constitutional court hearing.
[1:03:22.580 --> 1:03:33.580]  Apparently, the Second Amendment no longer exists in Commiforna, making it a prime destination for home invasions, carjackings, and full-blown chaos.
[1:03:33.580 --> 1:03:38.580]  A frightening night for people living in this Eastlake neighborhood after a home invasion robbery.
[1:03:38.580 --> 1:03:45.580]  A family who's blurred out in this video is held at gunpoint for an hour as mass thieves ransack their home.
[1:03:45.580 --> 1:03:51.580]  Criminals that are now locked up, six in all and all young, connected to a string of home invasions that terrorized the North County.
[1:03:51.580 --> 1:03:57.580]  Lodi are searching for a suspect in connection with a homicide and home invasion robbery that left a 26-year-old man dead.
[1:03:57.580 --> 1:04:03.580]  The two robbers walking around through the downstairs. This happened at 10.55 in the morning last Friday.
[1:04:03.580 --> 1:04:10.580]  Immediately, the suspects forced their way into the residence and began assaulting the victim.
[1:04:10.580 --> 1:04:14.580]  The horrifying home invasion happened in a matter of seconds.
[1:04:14.580 --> 1:04:20.580]  Two thieves burst through the door and are seen dragging an elderly man across the living room.
[1:04:20.580 --> 1:04:27.580]  One of the guys just grabbed him and tore him, asked him, what's the money? What's all the money?
[1:04:27.580 --> 1:04:37.580]  A carjacker broke into the driver's seat of their minivan and took the keys, but a group of bystanders jumped in to stop him.
[1:04:37.580 --> 1:04:42.580]  A wild night here begins with a carjacking and pistol whipping of an elderly woman.
[1:04:42.580 --> 1:04:51.580]  And then today, around three o'clock, the suspects were spotted here in Broadmoor, near Daly City, and police spent most of the evening trying to track them down.
[1:04:51.580 --> 1:04:59.580]  Just a circus almost for the area. There you go. I'm sure that's what the commands are, and then the commands are also going to be on your belly.
[1:04:59.580 --> 1:05:01.580]  John Bowne reporting.
[1:05:06.580 --> 1:05:09.580]  China was already running the United States.
[1:05:09.580 --> 1:05:12.580]  You're like, well, China could never take over the U.S. That's right.
[1:05:12.580 --> 1:05:22.580]  As the Roman historian and Senator Cicero warned, a powerful empire can't fall from without before it first falls from within.
[1:05:22.580 --> 1:05:28.580]  So yes, they're coming for your guns, all of them. Yes, they're coming for your children.
[1:05:28.580 --> 1:05:35.580]  They've already taken your speech almost everywhere, except pockets of resistance, like infowars.com and bandod video.
[1:05:35.580 --> 1:05:39.580]  So now you know why I'm so upset. Now you know why I'm so angry.
[1:05:39.580 --> 1:05:45.580]  I saw the producers of South Park on TV. They're totally pissing angry. People are like, why are they angry?
[1:05:45.580 --> 1:05:50.580]  Because they see all of their freedom, their American freedom, hard fought, taken away.
[1:05:50.580 --> 1:05:54.580]  Are you going to get upset? Well, you're a listener. You're obviously already upset.
[1:05:54.580 --> 1:05:58.580]  But you've got to ring the alarm everywhere, until others, they've got to get upset.
[1:05:58.580 --> 1:06:05.580]  And then take action and let Congress, everybody else, know that we're not backing down and we're not going to sell America out to the Chicongs.
[1:06:28.580 --> 1:06:33.580]  Transmitting Worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[1:06:33.580 --> 1:06:41.580]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, I had a feeling before I even went live today.
[1:06:41.580 --> 1:06:48.580]  And I called James O'Keeffe, and I called my producer who was talking to him, hours ago.
[1:06:48.580 --> 1:07:00.580]  And I said, if you have a problem posting your CNN bombshell footage to YouTube, please post it to bandodvideo.
[1:07:00.580 --> 1:07:11.580]  James O'Keeffe has this giant whistleblower inside CNN with just incredible information about how they know that impeachment is a fraud
[1:07:11.580 --> 1:07:15.580]  and there's nothing there, but they're going ahead with it and that he has a personal vendetta.
[1:07:15.580 --> 1:07:23.580]  And O'Keeffe has now put out a video. James O'Keeffe was scheduled to be on right now, this hour.
[1:07:23.580 --> 1:07:33.580]  James O'Keeffe is not here because YouTube is not letting him upload to their channel.
[1:07:33.580 --> 1:07:38.580]  So we're on the phone with O'Keeffe and his people right now saying, please post a bandodvideo.
[1:07:38.580 --> 1:07:40.580]  We want to host it.
[1:07:40.580 --> 1:07:45.580]  That's why we built bandodvideo because it's built for videos that are banned
[1:07:45.580 --> 1:07:49.580]  because the establishment doesn't want you to see them.
[1:07:49.580 --> 1:07:51.580]  Bandodvideo is built for whistleblowers.
[1:07:51.580 --> 1:07:58.580]  In fact, we've been talking to Baratos and letting them know the last few weeks that we think that they should have a page there,
[1:07:58.580 --> 1:08:06.580]  just like Me More Old does and just like many others do, so that videos that have been taken down can be up there.
[1:08:06.580 --> 1:08:09.580]  In fact, punch up Me More Old, please, for TV viewers.
[1:08:09.580 --> 1:08:21.580]  Notice the one right in the middle is Fiona Hill Meet the Mole, the Soros Mole trying to bring down Trump.
[1:08:21.580 --> 1:08:26.580]  Think about that. Let's go back to the main page of Bandodvideo, please. Thank you.
[1:08:26.580 --> 1:08:38.580]  And when you go there, you can see the Soros Mole video right up there on top.
[1:08:38.580 --> 1:08:52.580]  That is a video that had over a million views in 2017 on YouTube, but was taken down.
[1:08:52.580 --> 1:09:00.580]  And again, if you just go to the front page, bandodvideo, bandodvideo, and just leave it there for a minute,
[1:09:00.580 --> 1:09:04.580]  I'll show people what I'm talking about.
[1:09:04.580 --> 1:09:11.580]  That's a good refresh again. Now, you see right there on the left-hand side, that's the video that they banned right there.
[1:09:11.580 --> 1:09:15.580]  Soros Mole bombshell flashback.
[1:09:15.580 --> 1:09:19.580]  Why how CIA leaker is Soros Mole Fiona Hill?
[1:09:19.580 --> 1:09:27.580]  Then if you look at the video to the right of it, that's the video I shot Saturday that aired on The Sunday Show.
[1:09:27.580 --> 1:09:38.580]  Meet Fiona Hill, the Soros Mole aiming to take down Trump.
[1:09:38.580 --> 1:09:45.580]  Now, they won't let us put these on YouTube or Google or Twitter because they work for the system.
[1:09:45.580 --> 1:09:49.580]  They went and took those down. Everybody else that had them posted took them down.
[1:09:49.580 --> 1:09:54.580]  We had to come up here on the weekend, find it in the archives, and then repost it.
[1:09:54.580 --> 1:09:59.580]  You couldn't search the exact headline on Google or YouTube.
[1:09:59.580 --> 1:10:06.580]  We had to go to Bing that searches their index as well to find other people that had uploaded it as backups as well.
[1:10:06.580 --> 1:10:11.580]  And videos of Roger Stone saying, I've been threatened with prison.
[1:10:11.580 --> 1:10:17.580]  If I continue to expose Fiona Hill, well, they indicted him soon thereafter.
[1:10:17.580 --> 1:10:21.580]  So I'm not here trying to make a big deal out of what we're doing.
[1:10:21.580 --> 1:10:25.580]  This is a big deal.
[1:10:25.580 --> 1:10:30.580]  James O'Keefe is in real time.
[1:10:30.580 --> 1:10:35.580]  He has what is it like a billion views on his YouTube channel.
[1:10:35.580 --> 1:10:38.580]  He's been on YouTube for 15 years.
[1:10:38.580 --> 1:10:43.580]  He's world famous and they're not letting him in live time uploaded.
[1:10:43.580 --> 1:10:53.580]  They're watching in live time because you know that Jeff Zucker, the head of CNN is calling up the head of Google and saying you get control of that.
[1:10:53.580 --> 1:10:56.580]  It's not like he uploaded it and there was something wrong on it and they took it down.
[1:10:56.580 --> 1:10:59.580]  It's not like he violated terms of service. No.
[1:10:59.580 --> 1:11:10.580]  They're not letting him in live time upload it.
[1:11:10.580 --> 1:11:17.580]  We're going to play a clip of O'Keefe talking about this, but that's why we have banned on video.
[1:11:17.580 --> 1:11:23.580]  That's why I went on air today and said, I wonder if they'll even let him upload it to YouTube.
[1:11:23.580 --> 1:11:29.580]  That wasn't even a gut thing. That's a brain thing because of course they're going to do it.
[1:11:29.580 --> 1:11:38.580]  It's really number one on Twitter. They're not letting it trend.
[1:11:38.580 --> 1:11:42.580]  Because it shows them saying we have vendettas.
[1:11:42.580 --> 1:11:47.580]  We know there's nothing to impeachment like Van Jones on the project Veritas video.
[1:11:47.580 --> 1:11:51.580]  Well, I know there's no rushing it. It's all made up. It's a nothing burger.
[1:11:51.580 --> 1:11:57.580]  Well, there's video. I've talked to the folks that have seen it.
[1:11:57.580 --> 1:12:03.580]  The folks that are uploading it, they've got it and they're going to have installments throughout the day.
[1:12:03.580 --> 1:12:10.580]  16, 20 minute videos.
[1:12:10.580 --> 1:12:15.580]  Okay, so let's go ahead and play the first clip I said I was going to go to.
[1:12:15.580 --> 1:12:39.580]  Let's go ahead and play O'Keefe talking about how they wouldn't let him upload it. Here it is.
[1:12:39.580 --> 1:12:46.580]  Processing for 20 minutes. It's kind of unusual. So we're trying our best to get this thing online.
[1:12:46.580 --> 1:12:52.580]  But the tech companies aren't our friends right now. This is a hashtag exposed CNN.
[1:12:52.580 --> 1:12:55.580]  We're just trying to get the full production online.
[1:12:55.580 --> 1:13:01.580]  So we've got this 16 minute video here. We are trying to upload it to YouTube.
[1:13:01.580 --> 1:13:09.580]  And it's just our glassing. I mean, it's a 16 minute long production showing a lot of the bombshell material.
[1:13:09.580 --> 1:13:15.580]  We just can't get YouTube to upload it. It's stuck processing for 20 minutes. It's kind of unusual.
[1:13:15.580 --> 1:13:21.580]  So we're trying our best to get this thing online. But the tech companies aren't our friends right now.
[1:13:21.580 --> 1:13:27.580]  It's this is exposed hashtag exposed CNN. We're just trying to get the full production online.
[1:13:27.580 --> 1:13:34.580]  So we've got this 16 minute video here. We are trying to upload it to YouTube.
[1:13:34.580 --> 1:13:41.580]  And it's just our glassing. I mean, it's a 16 minute long production showing a lot of the bombshell material.
[1:13:41.580 --> 1:13:48.580]  We just can't get YouTube to upload it. It's stuck processing for 20 minutes. It's kind of unusual.
[1:13:48.580 --> 1:13:51.580]  So we're trying our best to get this thing online.
[1:13:51.580 --> 1:13:54.020]  The tech companies aren't our friends right now.
[1:13:54.020 --> 1:13:57.860]  It's this is a exposed hashtag exposed CNN.
[1:13:57.860 --> 1:14:00.660]  We're just trying to get the full production online.
[1:14:00.660 --> 1:14:02.860]  So we've got this 16 minute video here.
[1:14:02.860 --> 1:14:03.700]  We are trying to.
[1:14:03.700 --> 1:14:04.620]  Okay, so there you go.
[1:14:04.620 --> 1:14:06.340]  We're not going to loop that for you.
[1:14:06.340 --> 1:14:07.180]  We are back live.
[1:14:07.180 --> 1:14:09.820]  Ladies and gentlemen, I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[1:14:09.820 --> 1:14:12.580]  And we're going to be breaking all this down
[1:14:12.580 --> 1:14:15.060]  and covering it as it unfolds.
[1:14:15.060 --> 1:14:16.380]  And as the videos come in,
[1:14:16.380 --> 1:14:18.780]  we're going to be posting them to infowars.com,
[1:14:18.780 --> 1:14:20.740]  newswars.com and band.video.
[1:14:20.740 --> 1:14:23.940]  But they don't want us or Project Veritas
[1:14:23.940 --> 1:14:28.940]  or Daily Caller or anybody being able going in
[1:14:29.660 --> 1:14:34.140]  to the election cycle that we're already deep into 2020
[1:14:34.140 --> 1:14:36.780]  to be able to show these type of game-changing events.
[1:14:36.780 --> 1:14:38.540]  Like when Hillary Clinton fell down
[1:14:40.140 --> 1:14:41.940]  on September 11th, 2016,
[1:14:41.940 --> 1:14:44.140]  just a couple of months before the election,
[1:14:45.340 --> 1:14:47.220]  everyone uploading that footage
[1:14:47.220 --> 1:14:50.380]  was having it taken down for a day and a half.
[1:14:50.380 --> 1:14:54.180]  And they went on MSNBC and CNN and said,
[1:14:54.180 --> 1:14:56.620]  it's fake news, Hillary didn't fall down,
[1:14:56.620 --> 1:14:57.860]  she only stumbled.
[1:14:59.260 --> 1:15:01.540]  But I dig those tapes up, they're so powerful.
[1:15:01.540 --> 1:15:04.700]  And then it shows her when she looks like she's stumbling.
[1:15:06.180 --> 1:15:08.420]  Now that's in India, I'm talking about New York.
[1:15:08.420 --> 1:15:11.620]  And it shows when she's in New York,
[1:15:11.620 --> 1:15:16.220]  she stumbles and then completely falls down.
[1:15:17.540 --> 1:15:19.940]  Well, they cut it before she completely falls down
[1:15:19.940 --> 1:15:21.420]  and is having a convulsion
[1:15:21.420 --> 1:15:23.540]  and has to be picked up and put in.
[1:15:23.540 --> 1:15:25.380]  And they said, we were making it up.
[1:15:25.380 --> 1:15:27.500]  In fact, they said, Alex Jones is making it up.
[1:15:27.500 --> 1:15:29.740]  But so many people were uploading it
[1:15:29.740 --> 1:15:31.620]  and folks were seeing it and going, wait a minute,
[1:15:31.620 --> 1:15:33.260]  they're lying to everybody.
[1:15:35.140 --> 1:15:38.140]  So they had to back off and then let it be posted.
[1:15:38.140 --> 1:15:39.780]  It's the same thing with these people.
[1:15:39.780 --> 1:15:44.380]  They will get away with anything they can get away with.
[1:15:44.380 --> 1:15:47.140]  Lying, cheating, bearing false witness,
[1:15:47.140 --> 1:15:51.900]  they're doing it all, it's happening.
[1:15:51.900 --> 1:15:55.020]  All right, we do have the new 16 minute video.
[1:15:55.020 --> 1:15:57.460]  They were able to upload it, we're able to get a copy.
[1:15:57.460 --> 1:16:01.140]  Just went live on infowars.com and newswars.com.
[1:16:01.140 --> 1:16:02.300]  We're gonna up download the video
[1:16:02.300 --> 1:16:04.900]  and post it to the Band-Aid video to the backup as well.
[1:16:04.900 --> 1:16:06.140]  We're gonna play it.
[1:16:06.140 --> 1:16:07.220]  My fellow freedom lovers,
[1:16:07.220 --> 1:16:10.260]  I'm very excited to bring you Vaso Beats.
[1:16:10.260 --> 1:16:12.660]  I've been wanting a beat formula for years

[1:16:28.580 --> 1:16:31.700]  helps support the body's natural nitric oxide production.

[1:17:17.060 --> 1:17:19.620]  Seen on programs broadcast on Fox Business News,
[1:17:19.620 --> 1:17:22.460]  blockchain data centers offer an equipment leasing program
[1:17:22.460 --> 1:17:24.780]  in the explosive digital asset marketplace.
[1:17:24.780 --> 1:17:27.300]  Inspired by entrepreneurs who sold picks and shovels
[1:17:27.300 --> 1:17:28.260]  during the gold rush,
[1:17:28.260 --> 1:17:29.900]  the money is in the mining equipment
[1:17:29.900 --> 1:17:32.860]  used to manufacture dozens of critical digital assets.
[1:17:32.860 --> 1:17:34.700]  Not a security IPO or note,
[1:17:34.700 --> 1:17:37.260]  blockchain data centers have a proven turnkey equipment
[1:17:37.260 --> 1:17:38.540]  sale leaseback program
[1:17:38.540 --> 1:17:42.140]  with a 27% annualized lease payment deposited

[1:17:59.540 --> 1:18:01.220]  Equipment offer poses a financial risk to owners
[1:18:01.220 --> 1:18:02.940]  consult with financial professionals before purchasing.
[1:18:02.940 --> 1:18:04.260]  Not an offer to buy or sell a security
[1:18:04.260 --> 1:18:05.860]  which requires an offering document.
[1:18:05.860 --> 1:18:09.580]  I don't sell things.
[1:18:09.580 --> 1:18:13.340]  I don't promote things unless I know they get big results.
[1:18:13.340 --> 1:18:16.220]  You go out and you wear an infowars.com shirt.
[1:18:16.220 --> 1:18:17.740]  You might meet your wife.
[1:18:17.740 --> 1:18:20.340]  You might meet other fellow patriots.
[1:18:20.340 --> 1:18:23.300]  You might meet somebody that gives you incredible information.
[1:18:23.300 --> 1:18:26.340]  You also might get shot or hit in the head with a bike lock
[1:18:26.340 --> 1:18:27.620]  by an antiveterrest.
[1:18:27.620 --> 1:18:30.300]  Let me tell you, that's big results.
[1:18:30.300 --> 1:18:33.060]  Yeah, we're not in Kansas anymore as I like to say.
[1:18:33.060 --> 1:18:36.460]  But if you take our Ultra 12, strongest, best B12
[1:18:36.460 --> 1:18:39.060]  you're going to find out there under the tongue,
[1:18:39.060 --> 1:18:41.660]  it's the base for everything going on your body.
[1:18:41.660 --> 1:18:42.580]  It is amazing.
[1:18:42.580 --> 1:18:45.380]  Nothing is as powerful except for something like X2,
[1:18:45.380 --> 1:18:49.380]  which again, your body absolutely has to have as well.
[1:18:49.380 --> 1:18:51.620]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, Ultra 12,
[1:18:51.620 --> 1:18:53.780]  ultimate vitamin B12 formula right now,
[1:18:53.780 --> 1:18:55.660]  50% off infowars.com.
[1:18:55.660 --> 1:18:59.100]  You owe it to yourself to have Ultra 12 and to support the
[1:18:59.100 --> 1:19:03.300]  M4, and there's a big sale on it right now at infowarsstore.com.
[1:19:03.300 --> 1:19:06.780]  So take advantage of it at infowarsstore.com.
[1:19:06.780 --> 1:19:10.740]  Communist China quietly bought up Hollywood more than a decade
[1:19:10.740 --> 1:19:13.460]  ago, and they've been approving almost all the scripts
[1:19:13.460 --> 1:19:17.180]  that you see on television or in the movies for many years.
[1:19:17.180 --> 1:19:19.260]  And now they own our debt.
[1:19:19.260 --> 1:19:20.620]  Now they own the Democratic Party.
[1:19:20.620 --> 1:19:23.540]  Now they've merged Silicon Valley to censor patriots
[1:19:23.540 --> 1:19:25.300]  off the air.
[1:19:25.300 --> 1:19:26.740]  Washington Post comes out and says
[1:19:26.740 --> 1:19:28.660]  they hope that Gigi Ping, the dictator of China,
[1:19:28.660 --> 1:19:30.540]  will quote, destroy Trump.
[1:19:30.540 --> 1:19:32.100]  That's a headline.
[1:19:32.100 --> 1:19:35.780]  So infowars has been the Paul Revere of this operation.
[1:19:35.780 --> 1:19:38.660]  We have blown the whistle continuously,
[1:19:38.660 --> 1:19:39.820]  and have been proven right.
[1:19:39.820 --> 1:19:41.220]  And that's why it's more important than ever
[1:19:41.220 --> 1:19:44.780]  that we override Silicon Valley and their ChaiKong masters
[1:19:44.780 --> 1:19:47.660]  by word of mouth and spread the word about infowars
[1:19:47.660 --> 1:19:49.700]  and check out infowarsstore.com.
[1:19:49.700 --> 1:19:53.260]  That's where the arsenal of our republic is being funded.
[1:19:53.260 --> 1:19:55.620]  That's where the tip of the spear is continually being
[1:19:55.620 --> 1:19:59.060]  forged is infowarsstore.com.
[1:20:25.620 --> 1:20:33.700]  You are listening to an infowars.com front-line report.
[1:20:33.700 --> 1:20:36.460]  If you are receiving this transmission,
[1:20:36.460 --> 1:20:37.620]  you are the resistance.
[1:20:41.380 --> 1:20:44.500]  OK, the attorney general over the weekend
[1:20:44.500 --> 1:20:48.220]  gave an extremely powerful speech to a major college.
[1:20:48.220 --> 1:20:52.460]  To a 45-minute speech, there's only a few clips of it out
[1:20:52.460 --> 1:20:54.580]  on Twitter that are amazing, where
[1:20:54.580 --> 1:20:56.340]  he says there's organized evil trying
[1:20:56.340 --> 1:20:59.020]  to corrupt our children, trying to take over society.
[1:20:59.020 --> 1:21:01.940]  The left is trying to break down the fabric
[1:21:01.940 --> 1:21:03.620]  to overthrow America.
[1:21:03.620 --> 1:21:05.660]  They're sexualizing our children.
[1:21:05.660 --> 1:21:08.460]  It's criminal.
[1:21:08.460 --> 1:21:13.260]  Well, we are going to have excerpts of that speech for you
[1:21:13.260 --> 1:21:14.340]  later in the third hour.
[1:21:14.340 --> 1:21:15.740]  We're going to have open phones as well.
[1:21:15.740 --> 1:21:21.540]  James O'Keefe will now be joining us at 2.30 central today.
[1:21:21.540 --> 1:21:23.500]  He was unable to come on this hour
[1:21:23.500 --> 1:21:25.900]  because they already have a bunch of different clips
[1:21:25.900 --> 1:21:27.300]  that we're going to try to get up.
[1:21:27.300 --> 1:21:29.340]  They're having real problems getting them up.
[1:21:29.340 --> 1:21:30.700]  Now only one clip is up.
[1:21:30.700 --> 1:21:34.340]  We've got it again at infowars.com and newswars.com.
[1:21:34.340 --> 1:21:36.980]  No doubt, I'm sure drudgereport.com is linked to it.
[1:21:36.980 --> 1:21:40.380]  Drudge always is the biggest booster of James O'Keefe
[1:21:40.380 --> 1:21:42.460]  and Project Veritas.
[1:21:42.460 --> 1:21:45.980]  And then we'll get into the testimony
[1:21:45.980 --> 1:21:50.180]  by the known Soros Mole Fiona Hill
[1:21:50.180 --> 1:21:52.580]  and how she is really one of the so-called whistleblowers.
[1:21:52.580 --> 1:21:54.460]  I'm going to explain how that works.
[1:21:54.460 --> 1:21:55.740]  Oh, we've got to protect her identity,
[1:21:55.740 --> 1:21:57.460]  but then they're testifying.
[1:21:57.460 --> 1:21:59.140]  Well, again, because they don't want
[1:21:59.140 --> 1:22:02.380]  to initiate the original lie, the violation of national security
[1:22:02.380 --> 1:22:04.100]  to put that lie out, claiming they're
[1:22:04.100 --> 1:22:05.860]  releasing classified info.
[1:22:05.860 --> 1:22:07.340]  So that triggers the investigation.
[1:22:07.340 --> 1:22:09.220]  Then they get called as a witness.
[1:22:09.220 --> 1:22:11.780]  It's called parallel construction.
[1:22:11.780 --> 1:22:13.620]  That's coming up.
[1:22:13.620 --> 1:22:17.700]  Also, women's magazines continue to promote women going
[1:22:17.700 --> 1:22:24.420]  to Afghanistan, Pakistan, Syria, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan,
[1:22:24.420 --> 1:22:28.860]  other areas where unattended women are murdered, are raped,
[1:22:28.860 --> 1:22:30.300]  are kidnapped.
[1:22:30.300 --> 1:22:32.380]  I mean, it's like telling women to go to Somalia.
[1:22:32.380 --> 1:22:34.540]  Actually, they had a big feminist writer
[1:22:34.540 --> 1:22:35.900]  saying go to Somalia.
[1:22:35.900 --> 1:22:37.180]  That's really safe and nice.
[1:22:37.180 --> 1:22:40.820]  She just got killed there, of course, a few months ago.
[1:22:40.820 --> 1:22:44.180]  Forbes slammed for encouraging women to vacation alone
[1:22:44.180 --> 1:22:44.900]  in Pakistan.
[1:22:44.900 --> 1:22:49.100]  Ladies and gentlemen, they tell you to go into rural areas
[1:22:49.100 --> 1:22:51.860]  controlled by the Akhami Pashtun Network.
[1:22:51.860 --> 1:22:56.860]  If you're not with that Pashtun group
[1:22:56.860 --> 1:22:58.820]  and you're unattended, you'll be kidnapped or murdered
[1:22:58.820 --> 1:22:59.860]  most of the time.
[1:22:59.860 --> 1:23:03.300]  A woman alone is dead.
[1:23:03.300 --> 1:23:06.740]  So again, we know the North God Loki liked to set people up.
[1:23:06.740 --> 1:23:08.700]  He's like the devil, but like mischief.
[1:23:08.700 --> 1:23:13.980]  I mean, is Forbes run by Loki now?
[1:23:13.980 --> 1:23:18.860]  If the US military gets off the main roads in Afghanistan
[1:23:18.860 --> 1:23:22.300]  or Pakistan, they get attacked.
[1:23:22.300 --> 1:23:25.540]  Lone men are dead meat.
[1:23:25.540 --> 1:23:28.580]  Again, this is like telling a baby
[1:23:28.580 --> 1:23:31.340]  to climb into a lion's den.
[1:23:31.340 --> 1:23:32.380]  So why do they do it?
[1:23:32.380 --> 1:23:33.980]  It's very sick.
[1:23:33.980 --> 1:23:36.060]  And Paul Watson gives all these examples
[1:23:36.060 --> 1:23:38.620]  of women being brutally raped, murdered, killed.
[1:23:38.620 --> 1:23:41.660]  And these publications still say go to the exact place
[1:23:41.660 --> 1:23:45.860]  you're killed.
[1:23:45.860 --> 1:23:47.420]  Again, it's a war on reality.
[1:23:47.420 --> 1:23:50.260]  It's an inversion of common sense.
[1:23:50.260 --> 1:23:53.140]  I mean, I would never.
[1:23:53.140 --> 1:23:55.700]  If I went to Pakistan, I'd go on an approved tour.
[1:23:55.700 --> 1:23:57.660]  The government protects with armed guards.
[1:23:57.660 --> 1:24:00.100]  And I'd go see the sites and see major deals.
[1:24:00.100 --> 1:24:01.420]  You don't get off a bus.
[1:24:01.420 --> 1:24:03.340]  You don't do that in places like that.
[1:24:03.340 --> 1:24:06.260]  A lot of areas of Turkey, you'll get killed.
[1:24:06.260 --> 1:24:08.060]  And it's one of the supposedly safer countries.
[1:24:08.060 --> 1:24:08.940]  This is insane.
[1:24:08.940 --> 1:24:12.740]  So that's all coming up.
[1:24:12.740 --> 1:24:15.380]  But again, the Project Veritas first installment,
[1:24:15.380 --> 1:24:20.380]  19 minute video, is up on infowars.com and newswars.com
[1:24:20.380 --> 1:24:22.140]  right now.
[1:24:22.140 --> 1:24:25.300]  And we're seeing Twitter blocking it, being able to trend.
[1:24:25.300 --> 1:24:27.300]  But it's still getting out regardless.
[1:24:27.300 --> 1:24:30.740]  When you get excited, when you take action, it's unstoppable.
[1:24:30.740 --> 1:24:36.460]  But what's going to happen when everybody sees Jeff Zucker,
[1:24:36.460 --> 1:24:38.780]  the head of CNN saying, I haven't been dead against Trump
[1:24:38.780 --> 1:24:43.340]  and we know there's nothing in the impeachment.
[1:24:43.340 --> 1:24:44.380]  We know it's going nowhere.
[1:24:44.380 --> 1:24:46.980]  We know it's not true, but we're going to go ahead with it.
[1:24:46.980 --> 1:24:49.420]  Well, it'll just be like Brian Williams who said
[1:24:49.420 --> 1:24:51.060]  he was shot down in a helicopter later,
[1:24:51.060 --> 1:24:52.260]  said they weren't even shot at.
[1:24:52.260 --> 1:24:53.580]  They were lying about.
[1:24:53.580 --> 1:24:55.700]  He wasn't even in a helicopter.
[1:24:55.700 --> 1:25:00.060]  But Hillary said she was shot at in Serbia and Bosnia.
[1:25:00.060 --> 1:25:02.540]  Wasn't true.
[1:25:02.540 --> 1:25:03.300]  So why not?
[1:25:03.300 --> 1:25:07.060]  Why not keep lying if you get away with it?
[1:25:07.060 --> 1:25:07.900]  That's all coming up.
[1:25:07.900 --> 1:25:12.740]  But I'm going to play the next two segments, this 19 minute
[1:25:12.740 --> 1:25:15.340]  clip, some of the audio is excellent,
[1:25:15.340 --> 1:25:16.940]  some of the audio goes in and out.
[1:25:16.940 --> 1:25:18.820]  And in pauses for radio listeners,
[1:25:18.820 --> 1:25:20.300]  I'll describe what we're seeing here.
[1:25:20.300 --> 1:25:22.220]  I'll narrate it, but that's coming up
[1:25:22.220 --> 1:25:24.540]  start of the next two segments.
[1:25:24.540 --> 1:25:25.820]  I'm going to say it again.
[1:25:25.820 --> 1:25:28.700]  It's times like this where I cannot press on you enough.
[1:25:28.700 --> 1:25:31.740]  Please, for yourself and my family and your family,
[1:25:31.740 --> 1:25:36.940]  for everybody, go to info wars.com
[1:25:36.940 --> 1:25:39.140]  and get the Paul Watson and the Kit Daniels
[1:25:39.140 --> 1:25:41.500]  articles about this that have the live feed of the show
[1:25:41.500 --> 1:25:45.380]  and that have the project veritas videos posted in them
[1:25:45.380 --> 1:25:49.380]  and say, here's the hidden video CNN doesn't want you to see.
[1:25:49.380 --> 1:25:51.620]  Here's the hidden video CNN is censoring.
[1:25:51.620 --> 1:25:53.860]  And remember that at Bandot video,
[1:25:53.860 --> 1:25:57.780]  we have the Fiona Hill video.
[1:25:57.780 --> 1:26:05.940]  We have the Fiona Hill video brought in the National Security
[1:26:05.940 --> 1:26:13.140]  Council by McMaster, Osoros Mold, testifying to corroborate
[1:26:13.140 --> 1:26:17.060]  what these other third party hearsay people said,
[1:26:17.060 --> 1:26:18.460]  who they must protect.
[1:26:18.460 --> 1:26:21.460]  That's the telltale sign that it's people like Fiona Hill,
[1:26:21.460 --> 1:26:22.300]  because they don't exist.
[1:26:22.300 --> 1:26:23.260]  Oh, we can't show you.
[1:26:23.260 --> 1:26:25.140]  We can't let the other Republicans know who they are.
[1:26:25.140 --> 1:26:27.860]  Oh, Trump can't ever find out their identity.
[1:26:27.860 --> 1:26:31.580]  Oh, no, they can't testify only in secret to the Democrats.
[1:26:31.580 --> 1:26:35.060]  The end of due process, the end of facing your accuser.
[1:26:35.060 --> 1:26:38.900]  Those videos that they have fought to take down
[1:26:38.900 --> 1:26:41.260]  are on Bandot video.
[1:26:41.260 --> 1:26:44.380]  And sure, they got a few hundred thousand views a piece.
[1:26:44.380 --> 1:26:47.500]  They need millions, ladies and gentlemen,
[1:26:47.500 --> 1:26:50.300]  because the whole media is going to act like Fiona Hill's
[1:26:50.300 --> 1:26:52.820]  totally reasonable and she's doing a great job.
[1:26:52.820 --> 1:26:57.180]  And nobody should question what she's testifying about today.
[1:26:57.180 --> 1:26:58.380]  We're going to be covering all of that.
[1:26:58.380 --> 1:27:00.140]  But this is an information war.
[1:27:00.140 --> 1:27:02.540]  And these crooks have pulled out all the stops.
[1:27:02.540 --> 1:27:04.180]  Our weapons, the truth, it's powerful.
[1:27:04.180 --> 1:27:09.660]  They can't beat it unless they can keep it hidden.
[1:27:09.660 --> 1:27:12.180]  We're going to go to break.
[1:27:12.180 --> 1:27:14.140]  We're going to come back.
[1:27:14.140 --> 1:27:17.180]  We're going to lay it all out here today.
[1:27:17.180 --> 1:27:19.660]  Please don't forget that we are listener supported.
[1:27:19.660 --> 1:27:20.540]  I try to talk to you.
[1:27:20.540 --> 1:27:22.700]  Please don't forget that we are listener supported.
[1:27:22.700 --> 1:27:25.020]  I try to make it easy for you to support us
[1:27:25.020 --> 1:27:27.300]  with great products.
[1:27:27.300 --> 1:27:31.180]  Undoubtedly, the fluoride-free, colloidal silver iodine
[1:27:31.180 --> 1:27:36.860]  and colloidal silver and iodine fortified super silver
[1:27:36.860 --> 1:27:39.180]  toothpaste is amazing.
[1:27:39.180 --> 1:27:39.780]  People love it.
[1:27:39.780 --> 1:27:41.140]  It doesn't have any fillers in it.
[1:27:41.140 --> 1:27:42.420]  It's concentrated toothpaste.
[1:27:42.420 --> 1:27:43.660]  It lasts a long time.
[1:27:43.660 --> 1:27:45.940]  It works great.
[1:27:45.940 --> 1:27:48.300]  We're selling it at 50% off right now.
[1:27:48.300 --> 1:27:52.300]  It's got thousands of five-star reviews and 95% review rate.
[1:27:52.300 --> 1:27:53.660]  We're very, very proud of it.
[1:27:53.660 --> 1:27:55.100]  And that's how you fund our operation.
[1:27:55.100 --> 1:27:56.980]  I want to thank you all that are deciding
[1:27:56.980 --> 1:27:59.620]  to use our toothpaste.
[1:27:59.620 --> 1:28:00.860]  It's 50% off right now.
[1:28:00.860 --> 1:28:03.220]  We have the Everything Must Go special,
[1:28:03.220 --> 1:28:05.700]  where some items are 70% off.
[1:28:05.700 --> 1:28:09.740]  Everything is 40% to 70% off except the skin cream,
[1:28:09.740 --> 1:28:11.780]  because at 40% off, we lose money.
[1:28:11.780 --> 1:28:13.660]  It's already discounted so much.
[1:28:13.660 --> 1:28:15.820]  Fortified with the silver salt solution,
[1:28:15.820 --> 1:28:17.500]  the hyaluronic acid, so much more.
[1:28:17.500 --> 1:28:21.060]  It's a high-end skin cream, very, very low cost for you.
[1:28:21.060 --> 1:28:23.900]  And when it's discounted, we're making a few bucks on it.
[1:28:23.900 --> 1:28:26.300]  But it is almost a lost leader.
[1:28:26.300 --> 1:28:28.860]  And we have survival shield X3 with the Deep Earth
[1:28:28.860 --> 1:28:31.020]  crystal iodine with the two other types of iodine.
[1:28:31.020 --> 1:28:32.460]  The doctor was explaining to us that it's even more
[1:28:32.460 --> 1:28:33.420]  absorbable that way.
[1:28:33.420 --> 1:28:34.100]  We still have X2.
[1:28:34.100 --> 1:28:35.260]  It's excellent as well.
[1:28:35.260 --> 1:28:38.380]  But X3 and 2-ounce bottles is 70% off.
[1:28:38.380 --> 1:28:41.540]  X3 and 1-ounce bottles is 60% off.
[1:28:41.540 --> 1:28:43.220]  There's a whole bunch of other big specials
[1:28:43.220 --> 1:28:44.620]  at m4warstore.com.
[1:28:44.620 --> 1:28:47.620]  Ultra 12, that is so good, high-quality B12,
[1:28:47.620 --> 1:28:48.820]  taken under the tongue.
[1:28:48.820 --> 1:28:52.220]  50% off bodies, ultimate tumor for it, 50% off.

[1:29:00.460 --> 1:29:01.740]  So thank you for the support.
[1:29:01.740 --> 1:29:04.540]  We'll be back with the over-the-top bombshell project
[1:29:04.540 --> 1:29:06.740]  veritas.
[1:29:06.740 --> 1:29:09.220]  Fellow patriots, my name is Todd Savage,
[1:29:09.220 --> 1:29:11.780]  founder of Black Rifle Real Estate.com.
[1:29:11.780 --> 1:29:14.660]  Like you, I was a prisoner of the out-left sanctuary state
[1:29:14.660 --> 1:29:17.140]  until one day I chose to leave my family to freedom.
[1:29:17.140 --> 1:29:19.460]  Today, we live on a sustainable 20-acre homestead
[1:29:19.460 --> 1:29:22.540]  where we shoot, hunt, garden, and homeschool our children
[1:29:22.540 --> 1:29:25.220]  without the tyranny of the nanny state looking over us.
[1:29:25.220 --> 1:29:27.420]  If you're ready to flee the city to the freedom of Idaho
[1:29:27.420 --> 1:29:30.660]  or Montana, our Black Rifle Real Estate team is here to help.

[1:30:07.460 --> 1:30:11.820]  My phone has been ringing off the hook. Constitutional lawyers,
[1:30:11.820 --> 1:30:14.420]  national talk show host, prominent guest
[1:30:14.420 --> 1:30:15.540]  I've had on over the years.
[1:30:15.540 --> 1:30:17.980]  And they're all saying, Alex, it's incredible.
[1:30:17.980 --> 1:30:21.300]  You've been obsessing on China since you got on air 20-something
[1:30:21.300 --> 1:30:23.500]  years ago, and now it's all coming true.
[1:30:23.500 --> 1:30:24.780]  How did you know it?
[1:30:24.780 --> 1:30:26.460]  Because the Council on Farm Relations
[1:30:26.460 --> 1:30:27.980]  is the shadow government, and they
[1:30:27.980 --> 1:30:32.020]  admitted the plan to transfer all power to communist China.
[1:30:32.020 --> 1:30:35.100]  And almost everyone calling me says, yeah,
[1:30:35.100 --> 1:30:37.980]  and they banned you because you were saying all that
[1:30:37.980 --> 1:30:40.620]  in how Silicon Valley, Google, and Apple moved over there.
[1:30:40.620 --> 1:30:41.940]  And it's incredible.
[1:30:41.940 --> 1:30:43.340]  And wow, you're vindicated.
[1:30:43.340 --> 1:30:45.540]  You're going to get back on the air now, aren't you?
[1:30:45.540 --> 1:30:48.500]  And no, if we don't defeat this takeover,
[1:30:48.500 --> 1:30:49.900]  you're all going to be taken off.
[1:30:49.900 --> 1:30:50.900]  In fact, you're all going to end up
[1:30:50.900 --> 1:30:52.340]  getting put in prison camps.
[1:30:52.340 --> 1:30:53.620]  They're making their move.
[1:30:53.620 --> 1:30:55.140]  They're coming for your guns.
[1:30:55.140 --> 1:30:56.500]  They're coming for your kids.
[1:30:56.500 --> 1:30:58.500]  They're coming for your right to religion.
[1:30:58.500 --> 1:31:00.860]  They are coming for your soul.
[1:31:00.860 --> 1:31:02.140]  Well, you know what they say.
[1:31:02.140 --> 1:31:04.380]  You got to lower your ideals of freedom
[1:31:04.380 --> 1:31:06.860]  if you want to suck on the warm teat of China.

[1:31:47.900 --> 1:31:51.060]  and then tell others about it so they can get the app.

[1:33:35.180 --> 1:33:38.060]  is being collated and put into articles in the front page

[1:33:47.900 --> 1:33:50.540]  We're taking all the videos that O'Keeffe's putting out
[1:33:50.540 --> 1:33:53.060]  and posting them to band.video as well.
[1:33:55.340 --> 1:33:58.940]  O'Keeffe is scheduled to join us now in the fourth hour.
[1:34:00.380 --> 1:34:03.260]  CNN Insider blows whistle on network president
[1:34:03.260 --> 1:34:07.260]  Jeff Zuckerberg's personal VIN data.
[1:34:07.260 --> 1:34:12.100]  That's in the middle of band.video right now.
[1:34:12.100 --> 1:34:15.500]  And we're exposing the Soros, Mole, Fiona Hill,
[1:34:15.500 --> 1:34:17.460]  and Roger Stone predicted she would do all this
[1:34:17.460 --> 1:34:20.100]  and set Trump up and now it's all happening.
[1:34:20.100 --> 1:34:22.340]  She is one of the quote whistleblowers.
[1:34:23.740 --> 1:34:25.580]  Then they call her as a witness
[1:34:25.580 --> 1:34:28.020]  when she's one of the whistleblowers to begin with.
[1:34:28.020 --> 1:34:30.620]  And that way she's never actually put on the hot seat.
[1:34:30.620 --> 1:34:31.980]  That's called parallel construction.
[1:34:31.980 --> 1:34:33.660]  And that's from our intel.
[1:34:33.660 --> 1:34:35.180]  Exactly what's going on.
[1:34:36.100 --> 1:34:38.140]  We'll break that down more in the next hour.
[1:34:38.140 --> 1:34:39.780]  I intend to open the phones up.
[1:34:39.780 --> 1:34:42.380]  We also have Bill Barr's incredible speech
[1:34:42.380 --> 1:34:44.260]  where he said they're sexualizing our children.
[1:34:44.260 --> 1:34:46.340]  They're consciously trying to wreck society.
[1:34:46.340 --> 1:34:48.140]  They're consciously trying to take over.
[1:34:48.140 --> 1:34:50.660]  The Democratic Party is basically now satanic.
[1:34:50.660 --> 1:34:52.020]  Now you know that, I know that,
[1:34:52.020 --> 1:34:54.020]  but everybody's finally getting it.
[1:34:54.940 --> 1:34:57.340]  That's the sexualization of the children
[1:34:57.340 --> 1:34:59.500]  that finally was too much for folks.
[1:34:59.500 --> 1:35:00.540]  Let's start getting to this.
[1:35:00.540 --> 1:35:04.660]  The first 16 minute installment by James O'Keeffe.
[1:35:04.660 --> 1:35:09.100]  This is Insiders, people that work there, managers.
[1:35:09.100 --> 1:35:13.100]  It's Jeff Zucker. Here it is.
[1:35:14.100 --> 1:35:15.580]  Hello everybody.
[1:35:15.580 --> 1:35:16.580]  He did.
[1:35:16.580 --> 1:35:18.900]  Okay, let's start watching, please.
[1:35:18.900 --> 1:35:20.980]  I don't care about the other stuff you do, but,
[1:35:20.980 --> 1:35:22.580]  okay, I don't care about them.
[1:35:22.580 --> 1:35:25.660]  Let's just stay very focused on a page, man.
[1:35:25.660 --> 1:35:26.940]  My name is Cary Porch.
[1:35:26.940 --> 1:35:28.940]  I'm a satellite uplink technician.
[1:35:28.940 --> 1:35:32.380]  I'm a contractor at the CNN Washington DC Bureau.
[1:35:32.380 --> 1:35:38.380]  But Jeff Zucker, yeah, basically, president of CNN,
[1:35:41.660 --> 1:35:44.860]  has a personal vendetta against Trump.
[1:35:44.860 --> 1:35:46.780]  He's not going to be positive for Trump.
[1:35:46.780 --> 1:35:49.180]  He hates it. He's going to be negative.
[1:35:49.180 --> 1:35:51.180]  I decided to wear a hidden camera.
[1:35:54.700 --> 1:35:56.500]  Meet with Ruth of this monster.
[1:35:56.500 --> 1:35:58.660]  Meet with Ruth of this monster.
[1:35:58.660 --> 1:36:01.660]  I'm going to get people to lay in the same way.
[1:36:01.660 --> 1:36:02.860]  Yeah.
[1:36:02.860 --> 1:36:05.140]  You have me that created the show.
[1:36:05.140 --> 1:36:09.180]  I decided to secretly record the 9 a.m. rundown call meetings.
[1:36:09.180 --> 1:36:12.340]  And it's basically run by Jeff Zucker, the president of CNN.
[1:36:12.340 --> 1:36:15.340]  We're moving towards impeachment.
[1:36:15.340 --> 1:36:19.700]  I mean, don't, like, you know, we should present, oh,
[1:36:19.700 --> 1:36:23.300]  this is going one way, and so all these moves
[1:36:23.300 --> 1:36:27.100]  are moved towards impeachment.
[1:36:27.100 --> 1:36:30.540]  When I came to work at CNN, I mean, it was my dream job.
[1:36:30.540 --> 1:36:33.180]  And that dream actually just turned into a nightmare.
[1:36:33.180 --> 1:36:36.940]  So I know that there's a lot of people at CNN
[1:36:36.940 --> 1:36:38.620]  that are friendly with the script.
[1:36:38.620 --> 1:36:40.060]  Time to knock that off.
[1:36:40.060 --> 1:36:41.820]  It's time to call them out.
[1:36:41.820 --> 1:36:44.660]  I think what's going on in America now
[1:36:44.660 --> 1:36:52.660]  is really fundamentally the result of years of fake news
[1:36:52.660 --> 1:36:56.780]  conspiracy nonsense from fake news, from Fox News.
[1:36:56.780 --> 1:37:00.260]  He was calling Fox News fake news and a propaganda machine.
[1:37:00.260 --> 1:37:02.940]  And with what I saw, I'm like, that's pretty much what CNN
[1:37:02.940 --> 1:37:05.820]  was, like, it's just pumping out propaganda.
[1:37:05.820 --> 1:37:12.660]  The fake conspiracy nonsense that Fox has spread for years
[1:37:12.660 --> 1:37:16.660]  is now deeply embedded in American society
[1:37:16.660 --> 1:37:20.820]  and, frankly, that is unconstructive to America.
[1:37:20.820 --> 1:37:25.380]  And I do not think we should be scared to say so.
[1:37:25.380 --> 1:37:27.020]  I just wanted to own where they're at.
[1:37:27.020 --> 1:37:28.980]  Like, hey, if we only left, cool.
[1:37:28.980 --> 1:37:30.580]  Let's just say we lean left.
[1:37:30.580 --> 1:37:32.700]  If we lean right, let it be known.
[1:37:32.700 --> 1:37:35.660]  But, again, it just dovetails back into the thing.
[1:37:35.660 --> 1:37:37.260]  I just want people to have the information
[1:37:37.260 --> 1:37:38.980]  to make up their own minds.
[1:37:38.980 --> 1:37:40.540]  He's known Trump for a long time.
[1:37:40.540 --> 1:37:42.940]  Like, they worked together back during the Apprentice.
[1:37:42.940 --> 1:37:44.420]  And hates his guts.
[1:37:44.420 --> 1:37:45.900]  He's trying to use the story.
[1:37:45.900 --> 1:37:47.620]  I know, like, that the others haven't seen a thing.
[1:37:47.620 --> 1:37:49.180]  We're doing too much.
[1:37:49.180 --> 1:37:50.420]  But he's the story.
[1:37:54.100 --> 1:37:56.660]  And he stole himself from the devil.
[1:37:56.660 --> 1:37:59.420]  Part one, they stole themselves from the devil.
[1:37:59.420 --> 1:38:00.900]  I'm Ty Trump, crusade.
[1:38:00.900 --> 1:38:02.380]  Man, what was it like the morning
[1:38:02.380 --> 1:38:04.620]  after this past election?
[1:38:04.620 --> 1:38:08.020]  But that day, man, just at 6 AM in the morning
[1:38:08.020 --> 1:38:10.700]  when I came in, like, the mood was just so sour
[1:38:10.700 --> 1:38:11.580]  personally.
[1:38:11.580 --> 1:38:13.820]  There was a fricking dreary day.
[1:38:13.820 --> 1:38:17.540]  I bet a fox, it was like euphoria.
[1:38:17.540 --> 1:38:20.460]  CNN likes to call itself the most trusted name in news.
[1:38:20.460 --> 1:38:24.220]  But that's not the story we heard from a CNN insider who
[1:38:24.220 --> 1:38:27.260]  blew the whistle, recorded everything,
[1:38:27.260 --> 1:38:30.420]  and came to Project Veritas earlier this year.
[1:38:30.420 --> 1:38:33.460]  Would it be fair to say that you being here today,
[1:38:33.460 --> 1:38:36.580]  is it not politically motivated?
[1:38:36.580 --> 1:38:37.740]  That's correct.
[1:38:37.740 --> 1:38:39.460]  It's not politics that motivates me.
[1:38:39.460 --> 1:38:42.700]  It's basically me wanting the news
[1:38:42.700 --> 1:38:44.500]  to be what they used to be, news.
[1:38:44.500 --> 1:38:49.580]  And not a infotainment or a game show or chasing the ratings.
[1:38:49.580 --> 1:38:53.220]  Like, CNN purports it to be facts first.
[1:38:53.220 --> 1:38:54.980]  And that's clearly not the case.
[1:38:54.980 --> 1:38:58.020]  Kerry Porch has worked for CNN for two years.
[1:38:58.020 --> 1:39:01.220]  He says when he started, he had high hopes for the job.
[1:39:01.220 --> 1:39:03.420]  But he quickly became disillusioned
[1:39:03.420 --> 1:39:07.780]  as he was exposed to rampant anti-Trump bias at the network.
[1:39:07.780 --> 1:39:11.420]  I noticed after, again, this is fairly rapidly
[1:39:11.420 --> 1:39:15.060]  after I started, within the first three to six months,
[1:39:15.060 --> 1:39:17.940]  that there was a strong group think that
[1:39:17.940 --> 1:39:21.860]  permeated through the halls and that everyone was on board
[1:39:21.860 --> 1:39:23.580]  the, you know, I hate Trump trainer.
[1:39:23.580 --> 1:39:28.220]  I want to, you know, basically go after anyone, you know,
[1:39:28.220 --> 1:39:30.180]  on the center or on the rights politically.
[1:39:30.180 --> 1:39:33.260]  Porch secretly recorded several of CNN's
[1:39:33.260 --> 1:39:35.140]  9 a.m. morning editorial calls
[1:39:35.140 --> 1:39:37.500]  where CNN's President Jeff Zucker leads
[1:39:37.500 --> 1:39:39.380]  the anti-Trump charge.
[1:39:39.380 --> 1:39:42.420]  They're promoting Taurus, not even.
[1:39:42.420 --> 1:39:45.660]  I mean, don't like, you know, we should present
[1:39:45.660 --> 1:39:50.460]  oh, this is going one way, and so all these moves
[1:39:50.460 --> 1:39:54.260]  are moved towards impeachment.
[1:39:54.260 --> 1:39:58.740]  So don't, don't lose sight of what the big story is.
[1:39:58.740 --> 1:40:01.100]  They're done every day, Monday through Friday,
[1:40:01.100 --> 1:40:02.900]  and it's basically run by Jeff Zucker,
[1:40:02.900 --> 1:40:05.260]  the president of CNN from the New York Bureau.
[1:40:05.260 --> 1:40:08.100]  And he would basically, you know,
[1:40:08.100 --> 1:40:10.940]  he runs it with an iron fist and it's actually respectable.
[1:40:10.940 --> 1:40:12.540]  It's like listening to him run his business.
[1:40:12.540 --> 1:40:14.180]  It's kind of fascinating.
[1:40:14.180 --> 1:40:16.500]  But hearing that from the strongest and most prominent voice,
[1:40:16.500 --> 1:40:19.660]  you know, the number one is on every day
[1:40:19.660 --> 1:40:21.780]  just hammering Trump in some way, shape, or form,
[1:40:21.780 --> 1:40:24.500]  or Republicans in general, about, you know,
[1:40:24.500 --> 1:40:26.260]  yeah, all these other stories might be happening,
[1:40:26.260 --> 1:40:28.100]  but we want to divert all our resources
[1:40:28.100 --> 1:40:31.420]  to this aspect of Trump, or that aspect of Trump,
[1:40:31.420 --> 1:40:34.420]  or most recently, it's just all about impeachment,
[1:40:34.420 --> 1:40:35.980]  impeachment, impeachment, impeachment.
[1:40:35.980 --> 1:40:38.540]  On the calls of the top leadership of the network,
[1:40:38.540 --> 1:40:41.500]  Zucker, CNN's president, Virginia Mosley,
[1:40:41.500 --> 1:40:44.460]  CNN's senior vice president of NewsGathering.
[1:40:44.460 --> 1:40:46.820]  There's a second lip of lower,
[1:40:46.820 --> 1:40:51.820]  and that it just now fortifies the complaint.
[1:40:51.860 --> 1:40:53.740]  And David Chalion, vice president
[1:40:53.740 --> 1:40:55.740]  and CNN political director.
[1:40:55.740 --> 1:41:00.340]  I think as big of a story as what President Trump
[1:41:00.340 --> 1:41:04.140]  has done here is the Republicans, sort of,
[1:41:04.140 --> 1:41:06.500]  either delusional or defiant, or silent,
[1:41:06.500 --> 1:41:09.420]  Republican, I think it has big of a story.
[1:41:09.420 --> 1:41:10.620]  Even what is going on.
[1:41:10.620 --> 1:41:12.580]  On the calls to executive producers
[1:41:12.580 --> 1:41:14.860]  and news staffers across the country,
[1:41:14.860 --> 1:41:17.060]  it is clear that Zucker wants his network
[1:41:17.060 --> 1:41:20.780]  to stay focused on impeachment and nothing else.
[1:41:20.780 --> 1:41:22.500]  Guns will be the central topic
[1:41:22.500 --> 1:41:25.260]  in the 2020 Democratic nomination race today.
[1:41:26.260 --> 1:41:28.700]  The givers pack is paired up with MSNBC.
[1:41:28.700 --> 1:41:32.500]  They've got a gun to have a hold of,
[1:41:32.500 --> 1:41:33.980]  they've got 10 candidates.
[1:41:33.980 --> 1:41:35.740]  We'll be showing up there throughout the day.
[1:41:35.740 --> 1:41:37.860]  I don't care about the other stuff you need to do about it.
[1:41:37.860 --> 1:41:39.420]  Okay, but I don't care about them.
[1:41:39.420 --> 1:41:42.420]  Let's just stay very focused on impeachment.
[1:41:42.420 --> 1:41:43.460]  They're ready to have a stake.
[1:41:43.460 --> 1:41:45.580]  Look, you're going to be coming up at three o'clock.
[1:41:45.580 --> 1:41:47.540]  Trump is at two.
[1:41:47.540 --> 1:41:50.340]  Well, all the presidents are part of the number one.
[1:41:50.340 --> 1:41:52.300]  The impeachment stuff, there's new developments every day.
[1:41:52.300 --> 1:41:54.820]  More shoes drop, and it's like, there's just nothing.
[1:41:54.820 --> 1:41:56.740]  We're going to come back on the other side
[1:41:56.740 --> 1:42:00.060]  and get back into this, but this is just amazing.
[1:42:00.060 --> 1:42:01.780]  Radio listeners can hear the audio.
[1:42:01.780 --> 1:42:02.900]  It's powerful.
[1:42:02.900 --> 1:42:05.460]  But if you're watching this right now
[1:42:05.460 --> 1:42:07.900]  at infowars.com, forward slash show, or band.video,
[1:42:07.900 --> 1:42:10.140]  or if you're watching it out there
[1:42:10.140 --> 1:42:13.220]  off the Project Veritas videos that are on our site
[1:42:13.220 --> 1:42:16.700]  and also on Project Veritas's and LinkedIn Drudge,
[1:42:16.700 --> 1:42:17.620]  it's just incredible.
[1:42:17.620 --> 1:42:20.260]  I mean, they've got in the newsrooms, out at dinner,
[1:42:20.260 --> 1:42:21.460]  out at the bars.
[1:42:21.460 --> 1:42:25.100]  They've got the big group calls with the CEO
[1:42:25.100 --> 1:42:26.540]  and their minions there.
[1:42:26.540 --> 1:42:28.060]  And you know what?
[1:42:28.060 --> 1:42:29.860]  Jeff Sucker's right.
[1:42:29.860 --> 1:42:32.780]  Forget just demonizing guns all day.
[1:42:32.780 --> 1:42:36.220]  Get a president in that's anti-gun.
[1:42:36.220 --> 1:42:38.540]  Get a president in that'll put Supreme Court members on
[1:42:38.540 --> 1:42:39.780]  that'll take the guns.
[1:42:39.780 --> 1:42:42.460]  He's shooting for the king, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:42:42.460 --> 1:42:44.020]  And they've already missed a bunch.
[1:42:44.020 --> 1:42:46.820]  So now they all want to force their will
[1:42:46.820 --> 1:42:47.820]  onto the American people.
[1:42:47.820 --> 1:42:51.780]  And they see Trump as the one standing between them
[1:42:51.780 --> 1:42:56.020]  and their destiny to finally mount America's head on the wall.
[1:42:56.020 --> 1:43:00.540]  We're going to come back with this incredible inside of you
[1:43:00.540 --> 1:43:03.500]  that goes beyond bias, but the organized crime that
[1:43:03.500 --> 1:43:07.300]  is the enemy of the American people seeing in.
[1:43:07.300 --> 1:43:08.620]  I don't sell things.
[1:43:08.620 --> 1:43:12.380]  I don't promote things unless I know they get big results.
[1:43:12.380 --> 1:43:15.300]  You go out, you wear an infowars.com shirt.
[1:43:15.300 --> 1:43:16.820]  You might meet your wife.
[1:43:16.820 --> 1:43:19.380]  You might meet other fellow patriots.
[1:43:19.380 --> 1:43:21.020]  You might meet somebody that gives you
[1:43:21.020 --> 1:43:22.380]  incredible information.
[1:43:22.380 --> 1:43:25.420]  You also might get shot or hit in the head with a bike lock
[1:43:25.420 --> 1:43:26.660]  by an antiveterrest.
[1:43:26.660 --> 1:43:29.380]  Let me tell you, that's big results.
[1:43:29.380 --> 1:43:32.060]  Yeah, we're not in Kansas anymore, as I like to say.
[1:43:32.060 --> 1:43:35.460]  But if you take our ultra 12, strongest, best B12
[1:43:35.460 --> 1:43:38.100]  you're going to find out there under the tongue,
[1:43:38.100 --> 1:43:40.700]  it's the base for everything going on your body.
[1:43:40.700 --> 1:43:41.620]  It is amazing.
[1:43:41.620 --> 1:43:43.500]  Nothing is as powerful except for something
[1:43:43.500 --> 1:43:46.180]  like X2, which, again, your body absolutely
[1:43:46.180 --> 1:43:48.420]  has to have as well.
[1:43:48.420 --> 1:43:51.740]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, ultra 12, ultimate vitamin B12
[1:43:51.740 --> 1:43:54.700]  formula right now, 50% off infowars.com.
[1:43:54.700 --> 1:43:57.300]  You owe it to yourself to have ultra 12
[1:43:57.300 --> 1:43:58.860]  and to support the infowar.
[1:43:58.860 --> 1:44:02.340]  And there's a big sale on it right now at infowarsstore.com.
[1:44:02.340 --> 1:44:05.660]  So take advantage of it at infowarsstore.com.
[1:44:05.660 --> 1:44:07.860]  I've got to really hand it to the listeners
[1:44:07.860 --> 1:44:09.780]  and viewers from Infowars.
[1:44:09.780 --> 1:44:13.460]  Your support and your help in rebooting Americana
[1:44:13.460 --> 1:44:15.620]  is a challenge to the globalist system
[1:44:15.620 --> 1:44:18.460]  of corporate tyranny has really caught hold,
[1:44:18.460 --> 1:44:20.100]  not just here in the US, but worldwide.
[1:44:20.100 --> 1:44:22.580]  And President Trump's fearlessness
[1:44:22.580 --> 1:44:26.060]  when it comes to promoting Americana and basic liberty
[1:44:26.060 --> 1:44:27.780]  is amazing as well.
[1:44:27.780 --> 1:44:30.780]  He's still lacking on the big tech censorship,
[1:44:30.780 --> 1:44:32.780]  taking action against that in some other areas.
[1:44:32.780 --> 1:44:35.300]  But trying to end the wars, boosting our economy,
[1:44:35.300 --> 1:44:37.460]  speaking out against communist China,
[1:44:37.460 --> 1:44:38.900]  Trump's been doing an amazing job.
[1:44:38.900 --> 1:44:41.380]  But now more than ever, we really
[1:44:41.380 --> 1:44:44.140]  have to realize that we're being targeted
[1:44:44.140 --> 1:44:46.180]  because we are effective.
[1:44:46.180 --> 1:44:49.540]  And the globalists are beginning to lose their war
[1:44:49.540 --> 1:44:51.060]  against humanity in a big way.
[1:44:51.060 --> 1:44:53.540]  And so we're going to see some major fireworks out of them.
[1:44:53.540 --> 1:44:56.820]  But it's critical to not let ourselves get down
[1:44:56.820 --> 1:44:59.300]  when we see all the poison they spray at us.
[1:44:59.300 --> 1:45:01.300]  That's an attempt to demoralize us.
[1:45:01.300 --> 1:45:06.860]  We've got to remember that and stay focused and stay happy.
[1:45:06.860 --> 1:45:11.140]  Globalism was doomed to fail if we just exposed it
[1:45:11.140 --> 1:45:12.780]  and then resisted it.
[1:45:12.780 --> 1:45:15.740]  Didn't I say a thousand times that there's
[1:45:15.740 --> 1:45:17.660]  no way you're going to have an authoritarian corporate world
[1:45:17.660 --> 1:45:20.060]  government above the law that doesn't pay taxes, that
[1:45:20.060 --> 1:45:22.180]  has diplomatic immunity, that runs around
[1:45:22.180 --> 1:45:24.060]  saying it's communist and socialist,
[1:45:24.060 --> 1:45:26.180]  power to the people, but then meanwhile,
[1:45:26.180 --> 1:45:27.620]  is tax exempt again offshore?
[1:45:27.620 --> 1:45:29.260]  Well, Trump got that.
[1:45:29.260 --> 1:45:31.220]  And all these other populists get it.
[1:45:31.220 --> 1:45:33.700]  Why would you throw away wealthy, successful countries
[1:45:33.700 --> 1:45:35.620]  and cultures just so you could say
[1:45:35.620 --> 1:45:38.180]  the communist Chinese, the David Rockefeller put
[1:45:38.180 --> 1:45:40.260]  in power, are better than everybody?
[1:45:40.260 --> 1:45:43.060]  That is a sick, freakish joke.
[1:45:43.060 --> 1:45:45.700]  And I will not stand by and watch humanity
[1:45:45.700 --> 1:45:46.860]  turn over to these people.
[1:45:46.860 --> 1:45:49.980]  And I beg God for the strength and the will
[1:45:49.980 --> 1:45:53.500]  to have the discernment to help be part of their defeat.
[1:45:53.500 --> 1:45:55.700]  And I've been saying that prayer for 20 plus years
[1:45:55.700 --> 1:45:58.580]  and God is delivering because God is great.
[1:45:58.580 --> 1:46:00.940]  Thank God for his son, Jesus Christ.
[1:46:00.940 --> 1:46:03.860]  And now let's move forward against the NW.
[1:46:03.860 --> 1:46:07.020]  Oh, oh, oh.
[1:46:07.020 --> 1:46:09.860]  China was already running the United States.
[1:46:09.860 --> 1:46:11.980]  You're like, well, China could never take it with the US.
[1:46:11.980 --> 1:46:13.020]  That's right.
[1:46:13.020 --> 1:46:16.220]  As the Roman historian and Senator Cicero
[1:46:16.220 --> 1:46:20.420]  warned, a powerful empire can't fall from without before it
[1:46:20.420 --> 1:46:23.020]  first falls from within.
[1:46:23.020 --> 1:46:26.780]  So yes, they're coming for your guns, all of them.
[1:46:26.780 --> 1:46:28.540]  Yes, they're coming for your children.
[1:46:28.540 --> 1:46:31.020]  They've already taken your speech almost everywhere,
[1:46:31.020 --> 1:46:35.180]  except pockets of resistance like infowars.com and bandod
[1:46:35.180 --> 1:46:35.940]  video.
[1:46:35.940 --> 1:46:38.020]  So now you know why I'm so upset.
[1:46:38.020 --> 1:46:40.060]  Now you know why I'm so angry.
[1:46:40.060 --> 1:46:42.900]  I saw the producers of South Park on TV.
[1:46:42.900 --> 1:46:44.340]  They're totally pissing angry.
[1:46:44.340 --> 1:46:45.580]  People are like, why are they angry?
[1:46:45.580 --> 1:46:47.700]  Because they see all of their freedom,
[1:46:47.700 --> 1:46:51.020]  their American freedom, hard fought, taken away.
[1:46:51.020 --> 1:46:52.460]  Are you going to get upset?
[1:46:52.460 --> 1:46:53.380]  Well, you're a listener.
[1:46:53.380 --> 1:46:54.820]  You obviously are upset.
[1:46:54.820 --> 1:46:56.820]  But you've got to ring the alarm everywhere
[1:46:56.820 --> 1:46:58.820]  until others, they've got to get upset.
[1:46:58.820 --> 1:47:00.780]  And then take action and let Congress,
[1:47:00.780 --> 1:47:02.900]  everybody else, know that we're not backing down.
[1:47:02.900 --> 1:47:05.100]  And we're not going to sell America out to the Chai Cops.
[1:47:10.100 --> 1:47:12.980]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:47:24.340 --> 1:47:27.740]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation,
[1:47:27.740 --> 1:47:31.860]  it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines
[1:47:31.860 --> 1:47:34.220]  of the Info War.
[1:47:34.220 --> 1:47:35.740]  OK, in this segment of the next, I'm
[1:47:35.740 --> 1:47:38.140]  going to finish up the first big installment by Project
[1:47:38.140 --> 1:47:40.540]  Veritas.
[1:47:40.540 --> 1:47:44.780]  The system is fighting to keep me from being able to spread.
[1:47:44.780 --> 1:47:46.940]  Well, leave me their concern right now.
[1:47:46.940 --> 1:47:50.860]  The CNN has openly honchoed the taking us off the internet,
[1:47:50.860 --> 1:47:53.660]  taking our sponsors away, harassing us.
[1:47:53.660 --> 1:47:55.300]  They're also working with the New York Times,
[1:47:55.300 --> 1:47:58.300]  put up a lie that Trump, at his resort, showed a video
[1:47:58.300 --> 1:47:59.540]  of the media being killed.
[1:47:59.540 --> 1:48:00.820]  None of that's true.
[1:48:00.820 --> 1:48:02.180]  We have the actual video.
[1:48:02.180 --> 1:48:04.220]  You take the New York Times and show you the video
[1:48:04.220 --> 1:48:05.260]  when they're saying all this.
[1:48:05.260 --> 1:48:10.900]  We have the meme video posted on memeworld.com.
[1:48:10.900 --> 1:48:14.260]  We have it linked on Info Wars to that.
[1:48:14.260 --> 1:48:16.300]  And I talked to Carpe Donck from about it this morning.
[1:48:16.300 --> 1:48:18.220]  He's an expert on all that, what really happened.
[1:48:18.220 --> 1:48:22.060]  Media contrives new hysteria out of a violent Trump meme
[1:48:22.060 --> 1:48:24.380]  video, but we'll be going over all that.
[1:48:24.380 --> 1:48:27.580]  We'll be taking your phone calls on just the state
[1:48:27.580 --> 1:48:28.380]  of the country.
[1:48:28.380 --> 1:48:32.540]  And the fact that we are in a civil war against multinational
[1:48:32.540 --> 1:48:38.660]  globalists that are making their move against this nation.
[1:48:38.660 --> 1:48:40.220]  And the fact is, they are criminals.
[1:48:40.220 --> 1:48:41.060]  They'll do anything.
[1:48:41.060 --> 1:48:41.900]  They'll lie.
[1:48:41.900 --> 1:48:42.420]  They'll cheat.
[1:48:42.420 --> 1:48:43.300]  They'll steal.
[1:48:43.300 --> 1:48:46.140]  And they've got a large portion of the public, not a majority,
[1:48:46.140 --> 1:48:49.900]  but a large cut, a large swath, a large group,
[1:48:49.900 --> 1:48:56.100]  that believe all this and are deranged and who have adopted
[1:48:56.100 --> 1:48:58.500]  Satanism as their operating system.
[1:48:58.500 --> 1:49:03.860]  The Democratic Party has adopted the Church of Satan,
[1:49:03.860 --> 1:49:06.900]  Satanic Temple's movement.
[1:49:06.900 --> 1:49:09.740]  And they introduce people like, oh, we're not really Satanists.
[1:49:09.740 --> 1:49:11.620]  But this is how we freak out the Christians.
[1:49:11.620 --> 1:49:14.100]  But then people get involved in it.
[1:49:14.100 --> 1:49:17.220]  No, it's the real deal, folks.
[1:49:17.220 --> 1:49:18.740]  All of this is very, very serious.
[1:49:18.740 --> 1:49:21.540]  And they're making their move right now.
[1:49:21.540 --> 1:49:23.340]  But we're making our move as well.
[1:49:23.340 --> 1:49:28.820]  So let's get back to the CEO of CNN, Jeff Zucker, saying, hey,
[1:49:28.820 --> 1:49:30.660]  I don't want to go after the guns.
[1:49:30.660 --> 1:49:31.500]  And I don't want to.
[1:49:31.500 --> 1:49:33.100]  No, no, no, we're going to get rid of Trump.
[1:49:33.100 --> 1:49:34.300]  Everything's get rid of him.
[1:49:34.300 --> 1:49:36.020]  And then we'll get the guns.
[1:49:36.020 --> 1:49:37.180]  Here it is.
[1:49:37.180 --> 1:49:39.620]  And I don't care about the other something you do about it.
[1:49:39.620 --> 1:49:40.780]  I don't care about them.
[1:49:40.780 --> 1:49:43.580]  Let's just stay very focused on them.
[1:49:43.580 --> 1:49:44.700]  And everything that happens today.
[1:49:44.700 --> 1:49:47.380]  Because look, you're going to be coming on 3 o'clock.
[1:49:47.380 --> 1:49:49.580]  Be confident to all the presidents
[1:49:49.580 --> 1:49:51.540]  that are part of the number one.
[1:49:51.540 --> 1:49:53.620]  The impeachment stuff, there's new developments every day.
[1:49:53.620 --> 1:49:54.460]  More shoes drop.
[1:49:54.460 --> 1:49:57.260]  And it's like, there's just nothing we can do.
[1:49:57.260 --> 1:49:59.860]  And Zucker wants impeachment every single day
[1:49:59.860 --> 1:50:01.460]  to be the top story.
[1:50:01.460 --> 1:50:03.700]  So yeah, he wants impeachment.
[1:50:03.700 --> 1:50:05.020]  So above all else, honestly.
[1:50:05.020 --> 1:50:06.700]  Above all else.
[1:50:06.700 --> 1:50:10.180]  I totally understand that most, if not all,
[1:50:10.180 --> 1:50:13.340]  the people I work with will never want to speak to me again
[1:50:13.340 --> 1:50:17.220]  or possibly have negative motivations after the fact.
[1:50:17.220 --> 1:50:19.900]  I get where they're coming from.
[1:50:19.900 --> 1:50:21.940]  But I always respect the people that I worked with.
[1:50:21.940 --> 1:50:23.660]  They were amazing at their job.
[1:50:23.660 --> 1:50:25.340]  And many of them felt the same way.
[1:50:25.340 --> 1:50:27.380]  They just felt trapped that they couldn't say it.
[1:50:27.380 --> 1:50:30.340]  Nick Neville is a media coordinator in CNN's Washington
[1:50:30.340 --> 1:50:30.980]  Bureau.
[1:50:30.980 --> 1:50:32.740]  He says not everyone at the network
[1:50:32.740 --> 1:50:36.460]  agrees with Zucker's anti-Trump agenda.
[1:50:36.460 --> 1:50:37.820]  Yeah, because what's difficult is
[1:50:37.820 --> 1:50:42.860]  like we have some conflicting things that play here.
[1:50:42.860 --> 1:50:48.300]  Like, there's a lot of people who are out here trying to just
[1:50:48.300 --> 1:50:53.300]  do what they think is best of journalistic integrity.
[1:50:53.300 --> 1:50:57.140]  And then you get on the 9am hall, and big boss, Jeff Zucker,
[1:50:57.140 --> 1:50:59.420]  a ****, tells you what to do.
[1:50:59.420 --> 1:51:02.260]  And it's like, you have to, to a certain extent,
[1:51:02.260 --> 1:51:05.300]  you have to follow his verdict.
[1:51:05.300 --> 1:51:07.340]  Yeah, you got to go with the **** downhill.
[1:51:07.340 --> 1:51:09.540]  So you got to go with the boss there.
[1:51:09.540 --> 1:51:12.740]  And he's not a big, I mean, he's
[1:51:12.740 --> 1:51:14.380]  like had an ongoing feud with Trump.
[1:51:14.380 --> 1:51:15.140]  It's no surprise.
[1:51:15.140 --> 1:51:15.820]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[1:51:15.820 --> 1:51:17.700]  He's not going to be with Trump since the apprentice.
[1:51:17.700 --> 1:51:20.740]  In 2004, Jeff Zucker was one of the executive producers
[1:51:20.740 --> 1:51:23.620]  at NBC Entertainment that green-lighted and produced
[1:51:23.620 --> 1:51:27.140]  The Apprentice, a show that turned Donald Trump from real estate
[1:51:27.140 --> 1:51:29.460]  tycoon to a mega star.
[1:51:29.460 --> 1:51:31.340]  Many say the shows and Trump's success
[1:51:31.340 --> 1:51:34.060]  helped Zucker rise to the top at NBC.
[1:51:34.060 --> 1:51:36.540]  And then, according to Neville and others,
[1:51:36.540 --> 1:51:40.660]  Zucker as the president of CNN helped Trump become
[1:51:40.660 --> 1:51:42.020]  the mega candidate.
[1:51:42.020 --> 1:51:43.540]  He's known Trump for a long time.
[1:51:43.540 --> 1:51:45.940]  Like, they worked together back during The Apprentice.
[1:51:45.940 --> 1:51:47.780]  And hates his guts.
[1:51:47.780 --> 1:51:51.180]  I hate everything, how everything is like all Trump
[1:51:51.180 --> 1:51:52.060]  all the time now.
[1:51:52.060 --> 1:51:53.700]  Every one of my, every one of them
[1:51:53.700 --> 1:51:55.500]  that were complaints about it, they,
[1:51:55.500 --> 1:51:57.580]  they hate Trump every day.
[1:51:57.580 --> 1:52:00.540]  Just surprised CNN has been able to take down Trump, yeah.
[1:52:00.540 --> 1:52:06.420]  I was just like, I mean, I mean,
[1:52:06.420 --> 1:52:08.940]  I feel like they're trying.
[1:52:08.940 --> 1:52:13.420]  But, I mean, what could they do more, you know,
[1:52:13.420 --> 1:52:16.140]  than what they've been doing?
[1:52:16.140 --> 1:52:19.060]  But to a certain extent, CNN created,
[1:52:19.060 --> 1:52:21.420]  created Trump's celebrity.
[1:52:21.420 --> 1:52:24.900]  They created this whole, like, not his celebrity,
[1:52:24.900 --> 1:52:26.340]  but created his candidacy.
[1:52:26.340 --> 1:52:30.100]  Made him legitimate because they felt like they needed
[1:52:30.100 --> 1:52:32.340]  to show everything that he did from the beginning.
[1:52:32.340 --> 1:52:34.900]  So, like, Jeff Zucker can't really complain.
[1:52:34.900 --> 1:52:37.140]  Like, he kind of put this in action.
[1:52:37.140 --> 1:52:39.980]  Like, why would they do that, I don't get it.
[1:52:39.980 --> 1:52:41.300]  Readings.
[1:52:41.300 --> 1:52:43.300]  And that's sometimes what I, what I struggle with.
[1:52:43.300 --> 1:52:45.900]  Like, a lot of the decisions, I guess,
[1:52:45.900 --> 1:52:49.380]  all media companies make, but it's like, you know,
[1:52:49.380 --> 1:52:50.540]  they're out to make a profit.
[1:52:50.540 --> 1:52:53.820]  So, when people criticize, you know, the media,
[1:52:53.820 --> 1:52:55.980]  to a certain extent, some of the criticism is accurate
[1:52:55.980 --> 1:53:00.980]  because it can't totally be, like,
[1:53:00.980 --> 1:53:03.660]  completely for the objectives that you're seeking.
[1:53:03.660 --> 1:53:07.540]  Like, you know, I totally want to do just, like,
[1:53:07.540 --> 1:53:09.500]  the truth, like, the dog in reporting.
[1:53:09.500 --> 1:53:11.900]  But then you have higher-up executives,
[1:53:11.900 --> 1:53:14.940]  like Zucker and other people, who are saying,
[1:53:14.940 --> 1:53:16.220]  well, we got to make profit.
[1:53:16.220 --> 1:53:18.220]  So, you end up with things like,
[1:53:18.220 --> 1:53:19.500]  I don't know if you've heard this,
[1:53:19.500 --> 1:53:23.580]  but this week they had, like, a f***ing game show
[1:53:23.580 --> 1:53:27.220]  to, like, decide what dates there was gonna be this debate.
[1:53:27.220 --> 1:53:29.100]  So, it's like, they pulled names out of a hat.
[1:53:29.100 --> 1:53:30.820]  It's like, we're watching the game show network.
[1:53:30.820 --> 1:53:34.620]  So, it turns into, like, certain things that you do
[1:53:34.620 --> 1:53:36.860]  are trying to just attract viewers
[1:53:36.860 --> 1:53:39.100]  and it becomes kind of a comedy show.
[1:53:39.100 --> 1:53:42.220]  So, it's like, you know, you have people
[1:53:42.220 --> 1:53:45.060]  who are genuinely have all the right motives.
[1:53:45.060 --> 1:53:46.940]  Here, let's get a pause right here.
[1:53:46.940 --> 1:53:48.300]  Please back this up.
[1:53:48.300 --> 1:53:50.500]  See, these are quote executives
[1:53:50.500 --> 1:53:52.940]  and these are media managers, and these are people
[1:53:52.940 --> 1:53:56.180]  that are higher-up in the food chain at CNN,
[1:53:56.180 --> 1:53:59.580]  but they're not in the upper echelons, the upper echelon.
[1:53:59.580 --> 1:54:01.700]  They're in between the worker level
[1:54:01.700 --> 1:54:04.500]  and the top executive level.
[1:54:04.500 --> 1:54:06.620]  They're at the high-level managerial level,
[1:54:06.620 --> 1:54:07.780]  but not at the decision-making,
[1:54:07.780 --> 1:54:09.660]  so they don't have the full picture.
[1:54:10.740 --> 1:54:14.900]  CNN could tell the truth and have multiple sides of things
[1:54:14.900 --> 1:54:17.500]  and they would have giant audiences like they did.
[1:54:19.420 --> 1:54:21.340]  It's not just that the internet gives them competition
[1:54:21.340 --> 1:54:24.100]  or more channels, because internet shows
[1:54:24.100 --> 1:54:26.420]  that are populist and patriot and tell the truth
[1:54:26.420 --> 1:54:29.180]  are bigger than CNN ever was.
[1:54:29.180 --> 1:54:31.060]  You know, we're talking five, 10 million viewers
[1:54:31.060 --> 1:54:33.660]  per hour, per show.
[1:54:33.660 --> 1:54:35.540]  I mean, look at Joe Rogan,
[1:54:35.540 --> 1:54:37.100]  and he's more and more establishment.
[1:54:37.100 --> 1:54:39.060]  I'm not knocking him, but he's playing it safe,
[1:54:39.060 --> 1:54:41.420]  but just because he started organic,
[1:54:41.420 --> 1:54:45.460]  anti-New World Order, conspiracy theorist, as they call it,
[1:54:45.460 --> 1:54:48.660]  he has this giant list of listeners,
[1:54:48.660 --> 1:54:50.780]  way bigger than any CNN show.
[1:54:50.780 --> 1:54:53.580]  And Joe's average podcast is bigger than Sean Hannity.
[1:54:55.060 --> 1:54:56.180]  Well, there've been lots of shows
[1:54:56.180 --> 1:54:57.500]  that were bigger than Joe Rogan.
[1:54:57.500 --> 1:55:01.100]  They just got taken off Facebook and Twitter and YouTube.
[1:55:01.100 --> 1:55:02.460]  Oh, like Info Wars.
[1:55:03.660 --> 1:55:07.300]  And again, for me, it's not a measuring contest.
[1:55:08.140 --> 1:55:12.780]  It's that the truth is popular with the American people.
[1:55:12.780 --> 1:55:14.900]  And it's not just that it's my truth.
[1:55:14.900 --> 1:55:17.780]  No, I mean, the truth about the WTO or the IMF,
[1:55:17.780 --> 1:55:19.980]  the truth about the World Bank,
[1:55:19.980 --> 1:55:23.620]  the truth about world government,
[1:55:23.620 --> 1:55:26.380]  the truth about the globalist being a bunch of pedophiles.
[1:55:26.380 --> 1:55:28.340]  You wonder, like, why are they so evil?
[1:55:28.340 --> 1:55:29.620]  Why do they go out of their way to hurt people?
[1:55:29.620 --> 1:55:30.980]  Why do they go out of their way to,
[1:55:30.980 --> 1:55:32.620]  because they want your children.
[1:55:33.620 --> 1:55:35.820]  They want to hurt children.
[1:55:35.820 --> 1:55:36.980]  That's the religion.
[1:55:38.220 --> 1:55:40.420]  You know, some people are into breeding dogs,
[1:55:40.420 --> 1:55:42.220]  or some people are into mountain biking,
[1:55:42.220 --> 1:55:44.140]  and some people are into watching movies.
[1:55:44.140 --> 1:55:46.380]  And then the ruling class throughout history,
[1:55:46.380 --> 1:55:48.140]  when you get an evil group in power,
[1:55:48.140 --> 1:55:50.380]  is into hurting children.
[1:55:50.380 --> 1:55:51.660]  They want power.
[1:55:51.660 --> 1:55:53.020]  They serve the devil.
[1:55:53.020 --> 1:55:54.940]  And so you'll watch these videos,
[1:55:54.940 --> 1:55:56.100]  and you're like, yeah, we don't know why
[1:55:56.100 --> 1:55:57.420]  we go out of our way to do all this.
[1:55:57.420 --> 1:56:00.020]  Well, you know, we guess it's for ratings.
[1:56:02.460 --> 1:56:07.460]  No, it's because there's a mission to take down populist.
[1:56:09.140 --> 1:56:11.020]  That's why you're tuned in to CNN or any of these channels.
[1:56:11.020 --> 1:56:13.100]  It's all the same crap all the time.
[1:56:13.100 --> 1:56:15.220]  It's just that CNN is smarter,
[1:56:15.220 --> 1:56:16.820]  and they're like, we're not gonna say,
[1:56:16.820 --> 1:56:18.220]  we're gonna confiscate all the guns.
[1:56:18.220 --> 1:56:20.820]  We're not gonna say, we want to get rid of America entirely.
[1:56:20.820 --> 1:56:22.140]  We've already seen it.
[1:56:22.140 --> 1:56:23.300]  We've already said that before.
[1:56:23.300 --> 1:56:24.380]  Just get rid of Trump,
[1:56:24.380 --> 1:56:25.820]  and we can get it all done quicker,
[1:56:25.820 --> 1:56:28.580]  because he's about to get more Supreme Court justices in there
[1:56:28.580 --> 1:56:32.340]  when Ruth Bader Ginsburg makes the jump in the hyperspace.
[1:56:33.620 --> 1:56:35.580]  We're gonna come back with the rest of this,
[1:56:35.580 --> 1:56:37.140]  and then I'm gonna open the phones up,
[1:56:37.140 --> 1:56:42.140]  877-789-ALAX, 877-789-2539 on the Veritas bombshells.
[1:56:44.900 --> 1:56:46.940]  On the climate we're in,
[1:56:46.940 --> 1:56:52.740]  and the next move they're gonna make, I understand the frustration
[1:56:52.740 --> 1:56:53.740]  of the audience.
[1:56:53.740 --> 1:56:55.140]  These people started to be out of power.
[1:56:55.140 --> 1:56:56.220]  They started to be in trouble.
[1:56:56.220 --> 1:56:58.380]  And the fact that more comes out of just ads to it,
[1:56:58.380 --> 1:56:59.540]  it's like, really?
[1:56:59.540 --> 1:57:00.540]  Yeah, really.
[1:57:01.780 --> 1:57:03.540]  But there's good news, folks.
[1:57:03.540 --> 1:57:05.420]  More and more people recognize this is a fight
[1:57:05.420 --> 1:57:06.940]  between good versus evil.
[1:57:06.940 --> 1:57:08.340]  And towards the end of this next hour,
[1:57:08.340 --> 1:57:10.740]  I have the Bill Barr video almost ready.
[1:57:10.740 --> 1:57:13.940]  We're culling it down from 45 minutes to a segment.
[1:57:13.940 --> 1:57:15.940]  We're gonna air it at like a 10 and a half minute segment.
[1:57:15.940 --> 1:57:18.620]  So that's coming up next hour.
[1:57:18.620 --> 1:57:20.020]  Believe me, you don't wanna miss that,
[1:57:20.020 --> 1:57:23.140]  because the few little clips got millions of views
[1:57:23.140 --> 1:57:25.820]  and are very powerful, but I was watching the full speech.
[1:57:25.820 --> 1:57:28.620]  It's incredible, and it's getting no attention.
[1:57:28.620 --> 1:57:30.140]  The full speech has no views.
[1:57:30.140 --> 1:57:32.340]  We found it on YouTube with like 1,000 views.
[1:57:32.340 --> 1:57:34.340]  Well, it's about to get millions of views next hour.
[1:57:34.340 --> 1:57:37.020]  We'll post it to infohors.com and newshors.com.
[1:57:37.020 --> 1:57:39.820]  And then from there, it's up to you whether we win or not.
[1:57:39.820 --> 1:57:41.940]  And I'm not bitching at you, I'm just saying, listen.
[1:57:41.940 --> 1:57:44.620]  Ha, ha, ha, you are the wind in the sails
[1:57:44.620 --> 1:57:46.820]  of the ship Liberty, and the children and others
[1:57:46.820 --> 1:57:48.220]  under attack are counting on you,
[1:57:48.220 --> 1:57:49.620]  and I know you're coming through.
[1:57:49.620 --> 1:57:51.620]  So I appreciate you and I thank you.
[1:57:51.620 --> 1:57:53.620]  We'll be right back with our number three.
[1:57:53.620 --> 1:57:55.620]  Stay with us.
[1:57:55.620 --> 1:57:58.620]  The globalists have been planning to make their move
[1:57:58.620 --> 1:58:00.620]  on America for decades and decades.
[1:58:00.620 --> 1:58:03.620]  Hillary was supposed to get in and complete the takeover,
[1:58:03.620 --> 1:58:05.620]  the censorship, all of it.
[1:58:05.620 --> 1:58:07.620]  That's why they took me off the air first
[1:58:07.620 --> 1:58:09.620]  and banned me across the internet,
[1:58:09.620 --> 1:58:12.620]  because they knew that what we were saying was dead on,
[1:58:12.620 --> 1:58:14.620]  and they didn't want us raising the alarm.
[1:58:14.620 --> 1:58:16.620]  Well, guess what? Thanks to you spreading the word,

[1:59:00.620 --> 1:59:02.620]  I have an idea for a new infohors t-shirt,
[1:59:02.620 --> 1:59:05.620]  instead of this is your brain, this is your brain on drugs,
[1:59:05.620 --> 1:59:08.620]  this is your brain, this is your brain on 5G.
[1:59:08.620 --> 1:59:10.620]  Oh, yeah.
[1:59:10.620 --> 1:59:12.620]  Showing your brain, getting fried.
[1:59:12.620 --> 1:59:14.620]  Then I have some comments on your supplements, man.
[1:59:14.620 --> 1:59:16.620]  Totally changed my life.
[1:59:16.620 --> 1:59:18.620]  I use Turboforce, bodies, Albu power, Brainforce,
[1:59:18.620 --> 1:59:20.620]  Fish Oil, Ultra 12, Daily, X2 every several days.
[1:59:20.620 --> 1:59:22.620]  Now, what I've found is really combining them
[1:59:22.620 --> 1:59:25.620]  is totally synergistic and transcendent feeling
[1:59:25.620 --> 1:59:27.620]  that I get by combining all your products,
[1:59:27.620 --> 1:59:30.620]  and I just want to urge all your listeners who haven't tried them,
[1:59:30.620 --> 1:59:32.620]  I just want to say why not.
[1:59:32.620 --> 1:59:35.620]  Well, you're right that all of these things are known to be incredible,
[1:59:35.620 --> 1:59:38.620]  whether it's the turmeric, or whether it's the fish oil,
[1:59:38.620 --> 1:59:41.620]  or the krill oil, or whether it's the DNA force with the CoQ10
[1:59:41.620 --> 1:59:43.620]  and BioPQQ and all the rest of it.
[1:59:43.620 --> 1:59:45.620]  All of these are things that are like rocket fuel on the body.
[1:59:45.620 --> 1:59:48.620]  You take these bases together, then you have your foundation,
[1:59:48.620 --> 1:59:50.620]  now you can build the big strong temple.
[1:59:50.620 --> 1:59:53.620]  With these products I take, when I religiously remember to take them,
[1:59:53.620 --> 1:59:56.620]  it makes my life so much better, and then it funds the information war,
[1:59:56.620 --> 2:00:06.620]  which God bless you.
[2:00:27.620 --> 2:00:31.620]  From the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[2:00:31.620 --> 2:00:35.620]  Okay, there's so much breaking news at Infowars.
[2:00:35.620 --> 2:00:37.620]  My head is spinning at this point.
[2:00:37.620 --> 2:00:42.620]  News just broke, it's on Infowars.com a video, I'll add it later in the hour.
[2:00:42.620 --> 2:00:49.620]  Where ABC News puts out fake war footage that was shot in the U.S.,
[2:00:49.620 --> 2:00:51.620]  not in Syria, to blame it on Trump.
[2:00:51.620 --> 2:00:53.620]  I mean, they're just pulling out all the stops.
[2:00:53.620 --> 2:00:56.620]  You thought because they all got caught lying.
[2:00:56.620 --> 2:00:57.620]  They would stop lying.
[2:00:57.620 --> 2:01:01.620]  No, they just make the lies even more complex and over the top,
[2:01:01.620 --> 2:01:05.620]  and it's just insane.
[2:01:05.620 --> 2:01:08.620]  I've got an article here where they admit mainline studies
[2:01:08.620 --> 2:01:11.620]  that Gardasil gives you cervical cancer.
[2:01:11.620 --> 2:01:13.620]  I mean, that's the type of news I have.
[2:01:13.620 --> 2:01:16.620]  There's stacks, after stacks of it, it's out of control.
[2:01:16.620 --> 2:01:18.620]  These people are crazy.
[2:01:18.620 --> 2:01:20.620]  And what's going to bring them down?
[2:01:20.620 --> 2:01:25.620]  Inside these dins of lies, these dins of demons,
[2:01:25.620 --> 2:01:27.620]  saying, I'm not going to be part of this anymore.
[2:01:27.620 --> 2:01:31.620]  James O'Keefe scheduled to join us at the bottom of the next hour.
[2:01:31.620 --> 2:01:33.620]  Had a lot of technical difficulties getting their videos up,
[2:01:33.620 --> 2:01:34.620]  but this one did get up.
[2:01:34.620 --> 2:01:36.620]  It's on Infowars.com.
[2:01:36.620 --> 2:01:39.620]  You can also go to exposecnn.com.
[2:01:39.620 --> 2:01:41.620]  And there's just an email address.
[2:01:41.620 --> 2:01:43.620]  Give them your email address if you're a whistleblower.
[2:01:43.620 --> 2:01:46.620]  I point people there because they do a great job of whistleblowers.
[2:01:46.620 --> 2:01:48.620]  When a whistleblower to us, that's fine as well,
[2:01:48.620 --> 2:01:50.620]  but I don't care, just take action.
[2:01:50.620 --> 2:01:54.620]  Let's go back to the video of the incredible admissions
[2:01:54.620 --> 2:01:59.620]  of CNN executives and managers dealing with the fact
[2:01:59.620 --> 2:02:03.620]  that Jeff Zucker orders them to engage in this type of behavior.
[2:02:03.620 --> 2:02:04.620]  Here it is.
[2:02:04.620 --> 2:02:07.620]  You're surprised CNN has been able to take down Trump, yeah?
[2:02:07.620 --> 2:02:15.620]  I was just like, I mean, I feel like they're trying.
[2:02:15.620 --> 2:02:22.620]  What could they do more, you know, than what they've been doing?
[2:02:22.620 --> 2:02:27.620]  But to a certain extent, CNN created Trump's celebrity.
[2:02:27.620 --> 2:02:31.620]  They created this whole, like, not his celebrity,
[2:02:31.620 --> 2:02:33.620]  but created his candidacy, made him legitimate,
[2:02:33.620 --> 2:02:38.620]  because they felt like they needed to show everything that he did from the beginning.
[2:02:38.620 --> 2:02:41.620]  So, like, Jeff Zucker can't really complain.
[2:02:41.620 --> 2:02:43.620]  Like, he kind of put this in action.
[2:02:43.620 --> 2:02:45.620]  Why would they do that?
[2:02:45.620 --> 2:02:46.620]  I don't get it.
[2:02:46.620 --> 2:02:47.620]  Readings.
[2:02:47.620 --> 2:02:49.620]  And that's sometimes what I struggle with.
[2:02:49.620 --> 2:02:54.620]  Like, a lot of the decisions, I guess all media companies make,
[2:02:54.620 --> 2:02:57.620]  but it's like, you know, they're out to make a profit.
[2:02:57.620 --> 2:03:00.620]  So, when people criticize, you know, the media,
[2:03:00.620 --> 2:03:02.620]  to a certain extent, some of the criticism is accurate,
[2:03:02.620 --> 2:03:09.620]  because it can't totally be, like, completely for the objectives
[2:03:09.620 --> 2:03:13.620]  that you're seeking, like, you know, I totally want to do just, like,
[2:03:13.620 --> 2:03:15.620]  the truth, like, the dog in reporting.
[2:03:15.620 --> 2:03:20.620]  But then you have higher-up executives, like Zucker and other people,
[2:03:20.620 --> 2:03:22.620]  who are saying, well, we got to make profits.
[2:03:22.620 --> 2:03:25.620]  So, you end up with things like, I don't know if you heard this,
[2:03:25.620 --> 2:03:29.620]  but this week they had, like, a f***ing game show
[2:03:29.620 --> 2:03:33.620]  to, like, decide what dates there was going to be this debate.
[2:03:33.620 --> 2:03:35.620]  So, it's like, they pulled names out of a hat.
[2:03:35.620 --> 2:03:37.620]  It's like, we're watching the game show network.
[2:03:37.620 --> 2:03:40.620]  So, it turns into, like, certain things that you do
[2:03:40.620 --> 2:03:45.620]  are trying to just attract viewers, and it becomes kind of a comedy show.
[2:03:45.620 --> 2:03:49.620]  So, it's like, you know, you have people who are genuinely
[2:03:49.620 --> 2:03:53.620]  have all the right motives, but then you also have people who are like,
[2:03:53.620 --> 2:03:56.620]  well, we got to make money, and we got to attract viewers.
[2:03:56.620 --> 2:03:59.620]  So, if we just talk about Trump all day, people will watch.
[2:03:59.620 --> 2:04:05.620]  I think we're just trying every single way to show that we're in the right side.
[2:04:05.620 --> 2:04:07.620]  Yeah, because we want to be.
[2:04:07.620 --> 2:04:08.620]  We're the light side.
[2:04:08.620 --> 2:04:09.620]  Light and dark side.
[2:04:09.620 --> 2:04:11.620]  We're getting at the dark side.
[2:04:11.620 --> 2:04:14.620]  I think whatever tools I have for disposal,
[2:04:14.620 --> 2:04:16.620]  if that's what they're doing.
[2:04:16.620 --> 2:04:18.620]  Yeah.
[2:04:18.620 --> 2:04:20.620]  Whatever lies they got to tell, because they're the good guys.
[2:04:20.620 --> 2:04:22.620]  Media created this monster.
[2:04:22.620 --> 2:04:24.620]  Yeah, back in 2015, right?
[2:04:24.620 --> 2:04:36.620]  Yeah.
[2:04:36.620 --> 2:04:40.620]  That is the psychology they tell fake whistleblowers about info wars.
[2:04:40.620 --> 2:04:41.620]  They go, you worked there.
[2:04:41.620 --> 2:04:42.620]  You helped creating.
[2:04:42.620 --> 2:04:44.620]  Now you've got to lie about it.
[2:04:44.620 --> 2:04:46.620]  Would you like some money?
[2:04:46.620 --> 2:04:47.620]  Would you like a book deal?
[2:04:47.620 --> 2:04:48.620]  And then people say no.
[2:04:48.620 --> 2:04:50.620]  They go, well, now we're going to write bad about you.
[2:04:50.620 --> 2:04:53.620]  I mean, it's all the same tactic they use.
[2:04:53.620 --> 2:04:55.620]  It's cult programming tactics.
[2:04:55.620 --> 2:04:58.620]  When you pay to send your young person to college, when they get off,
[2:04:58.620 --> 2:05:00.620]  they go, there's white supremacists everywhere on campus.
[2:05:00.620 --> 2:05:01.620]  Come join us.
[2:05:01.620 --> 2:05:02.620]  They're going to kill you.
[2:05:02.620 --> 2:05:04.620]  It's all made up.
[2:05:04.620 --> 2:05:08.620]  I've got to really hand it to the listeners and viewers from info wars.
[2:05:08.620 --> 2:05:14.620]  Your support and your help in rebooting Americana is a challenge to the globalist system
[2:05:14.620 --> 2:05:18.620]  of corporate tyranny has really caught hold, not just here in the U.S.
[2:05:18.620 --> 2:05:24.620]  but worldwide, and President Trump's fearlessness when it comes to promoting Americana and basic
[2:05:24.620 --> 2:05:26.620]  liberty is amazing as well.
[2:05:26.620 --> 2:05:31.620]  He's still lacking on the big tech censorship, taking action against that in some other areas.
[2:05:31.620 --> 2:05:36.620]  But trying to end the wars, boosting our economy, speaking out against communist China,
[2:05:36.620 --> 2:05:37.620]  Trump's been doing an amazing job.
[2:05:37.620 --> 2:05:43.620]  But now more than ever, we really have to realize that we're being targeted because
[2:05:43.620 --> 2:05:44.620]  we are effective.
[2:05:44.620 --> 2:05:50.620]  And the globalists are beginning to lose their war against humanity in a big way.
[2:05:50.620 --> 2:05:52.620]  And so we're going to see some major fireworks out of them.
[2:05:52.620 --> 2:05:58.620]  But it's critical to not let ourselves get down when we see all the poison they spray at us.
[2:05:58.620 --> 2:06:00.620]  That's an attempt to demoralize us.
[2:06:00.620 --> 2:06:15.620]  We've got to remember that and stay focused and stay happy.
[2:06:30.620 --> 2:06:39.620]  All right, I have been attempting as best I can to cover the really amazing, thought-provoking
[2:06:39.620 --> 2:06:47.620]  Project Veritas video shot by a producer there over the last year.
[2:06:47.620 --> 2:06:54.620]  Replete with the CEO, Jeff Zucker, talking about the main missions, taking down Trump,
[2:06:54.620 --> 2:06:59.620]  getting impeachment, and the spin is, oh, that gets some ratings, but the truth is, they
[2:06:59.620 --> 2:07:03.620]  already have super low ratings because they've been caught lying a lot.
[2:07:03.620 --> 2:07:08.620]  It brings back some viewers by getting into Russiagate or impeachment gate, but never
[2:07:08.620 --> 2:07:09.620]  what they had before.
[2:07:09.620 --> 2:07:12.620]  So to say that they did this for ratings isn't true.
[2:07:12.620 --> 2:07:14.620]  CNN knows what gets ratings.
[2:07:14.620 --> 2:07:19.620]  Being pro-America, telling the truth, giving all sides of the story, people really want
[2:07:19.620 --> 2:07:21.620]  to hear the good, the bad, and the ugly.
[2:07:21.620 --> 2:07:26.620]  You know you're getting packaged crap from a bunch of arrogant globalists who won't say
[2:07:26.620 --> 2:07:28.620]  a word about communist China.
[2:07:28.620 --> 2:07:35.620]  I mean, listen, if basketball teams in Portland and Washington, that's what's happening, professional
[2:07:35.620 --> 2:07:40.620]  basketball teams, want to boycott Israel, that's their issue.
[2:07:40.620 --> 2:07:44.620]  But you notice those teams are boycotting Israel and boycotting Leopold because it sells
[2:07:44.620 --> 2:07:50.620]  scopes to the Israeli Defense Force, but none of them will say a word about China, and even
[2:07:50.620 --> 2:07:52.620]  when CNN says, well, are you for free expression?
[2:07:52.620 --> 2:07:57.620]  Oh, we can't even talk about free expression now, and they grab the microwave.
[2:07:57.620 --> 2:08:03.620]  So China is off limits, and you learn who the sacred cow is by who's off limits, who
[2:08:03.620 --> 2:08:04.620]  you can't talk about.
[2:08:04.620 --> 2:08:05.620]  And that's who owns our debt.
[2:08:05.620 --> 2:08:06.620]  That's who owns Hollywood.
[2:08:06.620 --> 2:08:11.620]  That's who's doing all this.
[2:08:11.620 --> 2:08:16.620]  There's a lot more, too, coming out from Project Veritas, and we're collating it all to band.video
[2:08:16.620 --> 2:08:19.620]  and them4wars.com right through the front page.
[2:08:19.620 --> 2:08:21.620]  Please spread it.
[2:08:21.620 --> 2:08:27.620]  These are the type of exciting events that really get people to wake up now.
[2:08:27.620 --> 2:08:34.620]  I'm going to go to your phone call starting in the next segment.
[2:08:34.620 --> 2:08:37.620]  But I don't even know really where to start anymore.
[2:08:37.620 --> 2:08:43.620]  ABC News has been caught putting out fake footage of supposed war in Syria to blame
[2:08:43.620 --> 2:08:44.620]  Trump.
[2:08:44.620 --> 2:08:45.620]  They admit now it's fake.
[2:08:45.620 --> 2:08:46.620]  We're going to get to that.
[2:08:46.620 --> 2:08:47.620]  That's onlym4wars.com.
[2:08:47.620 --> 2:08:52.620]  We have the Soros Mole Fiona Hill testifying in Congress right now, and they're saying
[2:08:52.620 --> 2:08:55.620]  that the other whistleblowers are going to remain secret.
[2:08:55.620 --> 2:08:59.620]  I'm explaining what's behind that.
[2:08:59.620 --> 2:09:04.620]  We have got Forbes slammed for encouraging women to vacation alone in Pakistan.
[2:09:04.620 --> 2:09:10.620]  What is behind that sickness?
[2:09:10.620 --> 2:09:15.620]  We also have the meme that MSM doesn't want you to see so they can then misrepresent what's
[2:09:15.620 --> 2:09:20.620]  really happening, whether to blame Trump and act like he and others are calling for violence.
[2:09:20.620 --> 2:09:23.620]  We'll get to that as well in just a moment.
[2:09:23.620 --> 2:09:28.620]  But first, someone could look at this meme we put out last week.
[2:09:28.620 --> 2:09:34.620]  It's the fifth installment of Fentanyl, the communist Chinese dragon.
[2:09:34.620 --> 2:09:40.620]  And you could say that we're threatening the producers of South Park when it's the
[2:09:40.620 --> 2:09:41.620]  opposite.
[2:09:41.620 --> 2:09:45.620]  They're saying they did a good job bucking the rest of Hollywood and standing up to
[2:09:45.620 --> 2:09:46.620]  communist China.
[2:09:46.620 --> 2:09:52.620]  But in it, Fentanyl says, if we ever take over America, we're going to kill you for what
[2:09:52.620 --> 2:09:55.620]  you've said about us, South Park, because that's what we do.
[2:09:55.620 --> 2:10:01.620]  And then I show people being executed and led to mass execution in China from two weeks
[2:10:01.620 --> 2:10:02.620]  ago.
[2:10:02.620 --> 2:10:10.620]  Now, the media could spin that to say, I'm calling for violence against South Park.
[2:10:10.620 --> 2:10:12.620]  Any moron could know that's not what I'm doing.
[2:10:12.620 --> 2:10:17.620]  But it's the same thing with this meme they're saying is an offensive threat.
[2:10:17.620 --> 2:10:19.620]  That's how they deceive.
[2:10:19.620 --> 2:10:25.620]  But see, they could say, oh, Jones put out a meme where he said that somebody's going
[2:10:25.620 --> 2:10:28.620]  to kill the South Park producers.
[2:10:28.620 --> 2:10:30.620]  Not technically, that's true.
[2:10:30.620 --> 2:10:35.620]  But they could make it sound like I was saying that.
[2:10:35.620 --> 2:10:37.620]  And that's not what I was doing.
[2:10:37.620 --> 2:10:43.620]  But that's the level of deception, because if they don't show you the meme, they can
[2:10:43.620 --> 2:10:44.620]  then misrepresent.
[2:10:44.620 --> 2:10:46.620]  And that's what's critical about censorship.
[2:10:46.620 --> 2:10:54.620]  Censorship doesn't just silence the person or group or organization or population.
[2:10:54.620 --> 2:10:58.620]  It then allows those that have speech to be able to misrepresent.
[2:10:58.620 --> 2:11:00.620]  And I know you know that.
[2:11:00.620 --> 2:11:05.620]  But let me tell you, when you're on the receiving end of it, and they can make the top story
[2:11:05.620 --> 2:11:15.620]  on Yahoo and Facebook that you sent child porn to people when you didn't, it's scary.
[2:11:15.620 --> 2:11:22.620]  Or when they say, Jones lost a lawsuit about a book I never even wrote that I'm not even in.
[2:11:22.620 --> 2:11:26.620]  And then you contact News Corp and say, we're going to sue you.
[2:11:26.620 --> 2:11:27.620]  And they go, go ahead.
[2:11:27.620 --> 2:11:28.620]  We don't care.
[2:11:28.620 --> 2:11:29.620]  We don't care.
[2:11:29.620 --> 2:11:30.620]  It's not true.
[2:11:30.620 --> 2:11:32.620]  That's what I'm saying is we're in a civil war.
[2:11:32.620 --> 2:11:35.620]  It's a war, folks, when big companies know they'll lose a lawsuit.
[2:11:35.620 --> 2:11:38.620]  But it'll take me three years to win.
[2:11:38.620 --> 2:11:41.620]  They don't care about the money they'll pay out.
[2:11:41.620 --> 2:11:42.620]  It's war.
[2:11:42.620 --> 2:11:44.620]  War is when you stop caring.
[2:11:44.620 --> 2:11:46.620]  War is when you stop talking and start attacking.
[2:11:46.620 --> 2:11:54.620]  And let me tell you, when they say somebody sent child porn out and it's not true, that
[2:11:54.620 --> 2:11:55.620]  means they're dangerous.
[2:11:55.620 --> 2:11:56.620]  That means they'll do anything.
[2:11:56.620 --> 2:11:57.620]  You see what I'm saying?
[2:11:57.620 --> 2:12:01.620]  And I'm not talking about me.
[2:12:01.620 --> 2:12:06.620]  We're always asking, how are you taking all these attacks?
[2:12:06.620 --> 2:12:08.620]  We're all under attack.
[2:12:08.620 --> 2:12:09.620]  America's under attack.
[2:12:09.620 --> 2:12:11.620]  How am I taking it?
[2:12:11.620 --> 2:12:12.620]  We're in this together, folks.
[2:12:12.620 --> 2:12:14.620]  You're under attack.
[2:12:14.620 --> 2:12:16.620]  That's what I'm getting at here.
[2:12:16.620 --> 2:12:19.620]  There's no escaping this thing now, except by standing up to it.
[2:12:19.620 --> 2:12:22.620]  So here's the latest meme.
[2:12:22.620 --> 2:12:38.620]  Ministry of Truth, some man on video, please share it, presents, slam dunk for China.
[2:12:38.620 --> 2:12:41.620]  Hello, stupid Americans.
[2:12:41.620 --> 2:12:48.620]  Since I know Chinese communists will have a good year, I told you just a week ago, when
[2:12:48.620 --> 2:12:53.620]  you don't do what we say, you die.
[2:12:53.620 --> 2:12:56.620]  Well, do a Hong Kong protest.
[2:12:56.620 --> 2:13:00.620]  Oh, and don't forget, we kill more than Hitler ever did.
[2:13:00.620 --> 2:13:05.620]  And that's why the liberals love us.
[2:13:05.620 --> 2:13:11.620]  In America, the colleges that we fund teach no porters, no walls.
[2:13:11.620 --> 2:13:13.620]  No USA at all.
[2:13:13.620 --> 2:13:20.620]  Let me show you a princely.
[2:13:20.620 --> 2:13:25.620]  America is a rotting caucus covered in filthy maggots.
[2:13:25.620 --> 2:13:28.620]  Look at your own James Harden.
[2:13:28.620 --> 2:13:31.620]  He came out and apologized to us.
[2:13:31.620 --> 2:13:32.620]  That's good.
[2:13:32.620 --> 2:13:35.620]  And now we tell the NBA what to do.
[2:13:35.620 --> 2:13:38.620]  And the NBA say yes, master.
[2:13:38.620 --> 2:13:44.620]  We love China, we love playing here.
[2:13:44.620 --> 2:13:48.620]  Finally, you saw what happened to South Park.
[2:13:48.620 --> 2:13:54.620]  They talk about our reeducation camps and our death camps and how winning the pool is banned.
[2:13:54.620 --> 2:13:56.620]  And let me now tell you what happens.
[2:13:56.620 --> 2:13:58.620]  They banned in our country.
[2:13:58.620 --> 2:14:01.620]  Then they put out sarcastic apology.
[2:14:01.620 --> 2:14:02.620]  That's not good enough.
[2:14:02.620 --> 2:14:07.620]  Once we take over, we're going to kill the South Park producers.
[2:14:07.620 --> 2:14:12.620]  That's what we do.
[2:14:12.620 --> 2:14:15.620]  Everyone is adopting our model.
[2:14:15.620 --> 2:14:17.620]  Big Tech is censoring Alex Jones.
[2:14:17.620 --> 2:14:19.620]  And now even Republican leaders.
[2:14:19.620 --> 2:14:21.620]  And they do nothing.
[2:14:21.620 --> 2:14:25.620]  Soon sites like that in the video will be shut down.
[2:14:25.620 --> 2:14:40.620]  You speaking Americans do not share that site or give a war.com. Submit. Do not fight back. Do what I say.
[2:14:40.620 --> 2:14:42.620]  I just caught you, American.
[2:14:42.620 --> 2:14:45.620]  You visited Bandar Video.
[2:14:45.620 --> 2:14:49.620]  Oh, Mark Zuckerberg and others angry at you.
[2:14:49.620 --> 2:14:53.620]  Do what CNN says and do not visit Bandar Video.
[2:14:53.620 --> 2:14:58.620]  Oh, I have to hurt you.
[2:14:58.620 --> 2:14:59.620]  Now, come back.
[2:14:59.620 --> 2:15:03.620]  We'll go to your calls and I'll play the band video that's up on memeworld.com.
[2:15:03.620 --> 2:15:06.620]  That's supposedly calling for violence when it's all a joke.
[2:15:06.620 --> 2:15:10.620]  And in the video, in the meme, Trump was attacked first.
[2:15:10.620 --> 2:15:12.620]  But I want to explain something.
[2:15:12.620 --> 2:15:18.620]  Communist China, in their own words, has killed 115 million people, 80 plus under mount.
[2:15:18.620 --> 2:15:22.620]  So if you're a human on earth alive the last 70 years.
[2:15:22.620 --> 2:15:28.620]  The number one cause of death, unnatural death, is Chinese Communist.
[2:15:28.620 --> 2:15:34.620]  So for me to say that the South Park producers, if the Chai comms ever took over, they'd probably kill them.
[2:15:34.620 --> 2:15:36.620]  That's completely reasonable.
[2:15:36.620 --> 2:15:43.620]  But see, if you didn't show the video, you could do what they did to this other meme producer and say that they're calling for violence, which they're not.
[2:15:43.620 --> 2:15:44.620]  It's amazing.
[2:15:44.620 --> 2:15:46.620]  But we'll show you the video on the other side.
[2:15:46.620 --> 2:15:48.620]  And it's up on infowars.com.
[2:15:48.620 --> 2:15:52.620]  And exclusive, watch the Trump meme video.
[2:15:52.620 --> 2:15:53.620]  MSM doesn't want you to see.
[2:15:53.620 --> 2:16:00.620]  The New York Times launches an outrage campaign aimed at memeworld contributor and the American priority conference.
[2:16:00.620 --> 2:16:01.620]  Stay with us.
[2:16:01.620 --> 2:16:30.620]  We'll be back with your calls and a lot more.
[2:16:31.620 --> 2:16:32.620]  We'll see you in the next one.
[2:17:02.620 --> 2:17:09.620]  Finally, there's a way for you to get into the blockchain, the hottest financial sector without all the speculation.
[2:17:09.620 --> 2:17:14.620]  No, enjoy a 27% annualized payment each month without the ups and downs of Bitcoin.
[2:17:14.620 --> 2:17:22.620]  Seen on programs broadcast on Fox Business News, blockchain data centers offer an equipment leasing program in the explosive digital asset marketplace.
[2:17:22.620 --> 2:17:32.620]  Fired by entrepreneurs who sold picks and shovels during the gold rush, the money is in the mining equipment used to manufacture dozens of critical digital assets, not a security IPO or note.
[2:17:32.620 --> 2:17:41.620]  Blockchain data centers have a proven turnkey equipment sale leaseback program with a 27% annualized lease payment deposited into your bank account each month.
[2:17:41.620 --> 2:17:42.620]  Don't miss this one.
[2:17:42.620 --> 2:17:43.620]  Take your claim today.
[2:17:43.620 --> 2:17:46.620]  Call 800-600-3388.
[2:17:46.620 --> 2:17:49.620]  That's 800-600-3388.
[2:17:49.620 --> 2:17:52.620]  These valuable lease contracts won't last long.
[2:17:52.620 --> 2:17:54.620]  Call now 800-600-3388.
[2:17:54.620 --> 2:17:56.620]  800-600-3388.
[2:17:56.620 --> 2:18:04.620]  Equipment offer poses a financial risk to owners consult with financial professionals before purchasing not an offer to buy or sell a security which requires an offering document.
[2:18:04.620 --> 2:18:09.620]  My friends, I've seen a lot of Donald Trump just like you have.
[2:18:09.620 --> 2:18:22.620]  And my goodness, yesterday's press conference, when they came in on him with all their garbage, the foreign reporters, the U.S. reporters, these little political sellouts, these whores, he just tore them to bits.
[2:18:22.620 --> 2:18:24.620]  And it's one thing to hear it if you're a radio listener.
[2:18:24.620 --> 2:18:25.620]  It's powerful.
[2:18:25.620 --> 2:18:28.620]  But if you see it, it's all at band.video.
[2:18:28.620 --> 2:18:30.620]  We've got the full press conference.
[2:18:30.620 --> 2:18:32.620]  We've got my boil down of how epic it is.
[2:18:32.620 --> 2:18:34.620]  It's all at band.video.
[2:18:34.620 --> 2:18:39.620]  You've got to share this with people because Trump was hitting on all 45 cylinders.
[2:18:39.620 --> 2:18:40.620]  This was amazing.
[2:18:40.620 --> 2:18:42.620]  And he turned the nitrous oxide on top of it.
[2:18:42.620 --> 2:18:46.620]  So in full wars, America, Trump, all of us, incredible things are happening.
[2:18:46.620 --> 2:18:52.620]  And we're sharing the ideas that are going to defeat the tyrants at band.video.
[2:18:52.620 --> 2:18:54.620]  And I got to tell you, we've done great video work.
[2:18:54.620 --> 2:18:55.620]  We've done great films.
[2:18:55.620 --> 2:18:56.620]  We've done so much.
[2:18:56.620 --> 2:18:58.620]  But websites are not our thing.
[2:18:58.620 --> 2:18:59.620]  Well, now they are.
[2:18:59.620 --> 2:19:01.620]  I'm so proud of band.video, folks.
[2:19:01.620 --> 2:19:02.620]  Check it out.
[2:19:02.620 --> 2:19:05.620]  The future is band.video.
[2:19:05.620 --> 2:19:10.620]  I've been in this fight so long against the globalists that I forget sometimes we really came from nowhere.
[2:19:10.620 --> 2:19:12.620]  And that we've changed the world together.
[2:19:12.620 --> 2:19:17.620]  And just how important your actions and my actions are every day in this fight.
[2:19:17.620 --> 2:19:21.620]  And right now we're running a gigantic sale, store-wide free shipping, double-patria points.
[2:19:21.620 --> 2:19:24.620]  And the everything must go super sale.
[2:19:24.620 --> 2:19:29.620]  And there are more than 50 items that are 50% off or more right now.
[2:19:29.620 --> 2:19:40.620]  It's 40, 70% off store-wide, 50% off brain force plus 50% off survival shield X2, 50% off ultra 12 bodies, ultimate tumor formula.
[2:19:40.620 --> 2:19:46.620]  The list goes on and on again, 70% off survival shield X3, the good halogen.
[2:19:46.620 --> 2:19:51.620]  You can get the 71% off on immune wall and super silver when you get them together.
[2:19:51.620 --> 2:19:56.620]  1995 for both gut fusion, amazing 50% off the list goes on and on.
[2:19:56.620 --> 2:19:58.620]  It's all at infowarstore.com.
[2:19:58.620 --> 2:20:00.620]  That's the umbrella site.
[2:20:00.620 --> 2:20:02.620]  InfowarStore.com takes you right to the supplements.
[2:20:02.620 --> 2:20:04.620]  InfowarStore.com.
[2:20:07.620 --> 2:20:10.620]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:20:10.620 --> 2:20:12.620]  Let's go.
[2:20:26.620 --> 2:20:30.620]  Alright, there's no doubt a Quickening is happening.
[2:20:30.620 --> 2:20:32.620]  I'm not one to complain.
[2:20:32.620 --> 2:20:36.620]  I'm just telling listeners that I am completely overwhelmed right now.
[2:20:36.620 --> 2:20:40.620]  I had like five stories break during the four minute break.
[2:20:40.620 --> 2:20:46.620]  Some of them were breaking, they're so huge I can't even control myself right now.
[2:20:46.620 --> 2:20:48.620]  Oh my gosh, I got loaded phone lines.
[2:20:48.620 --> 2:20:52.620]  I got the huge bill bar video.
[2:20:52.620 --> 2:20:54.620]  I've got James O'Keefe coming up.
[2:20:54.620 --> 2:20:55.620]  I just talked to Carpe Donkton.
[2:20:55.620 --> 2:21:00.620]  They just banned him on Twitter because he shared the James O'Keefe video.
[2:21:00.620 --> 2:21:02.620]  Wow.
[2:21:02.620 --> 2:21:06.620]  I mean this is just, there's a bunch of other breaking stuff I haven't gotten into yet.
[2:21:06.620 --> 2:21:10.620]  Our owner and Troyer went in and got kicked out of a basketball game,
[2:21:10.620 --> 2:21:15.620]  a national basketball game for exposing what's happening with the censorship.
[2:21:15.620 --> 2:21:18.620]  It's all coming up.
[2:21:18.620 --> 2:21:22.620]  And since I mentioned it, let's just get to this right now.
[2:21:22.620 --> 2:21:24.620]  Exclusive, watch the Trump meme video.
[2:21:24.620 --> 2:21:27.620]  MSM doesn't want you to see because they want to misrepresent.
[2:21:27.620 --> 2:21:29.620]  It's from The Kingsman.
[2:21:29.620 --> 2:21:34.620]  It's a movie, the left does this with all these memes showing conservatives having their heads cut off, everybody dying.
[2:21:34.620 --> 2:21:40.620]  This is a video from a year ago plus when Hollywood was saying kidnap Baron,
[2:21:40.620 --> 2:21:42.620]  put him in cages, have sex with him.
[2:21:42.620 --> 2:21:46.620]  Peter Fonda, you know, he died a few months ago, he said that last year.
[2:21:46.620 --> 2:21:48.620]  People responded to that.
[2:21:48.620 --> 2:21:50.620]  New York Times said kill Trump.
[2:21:50.620 --> 2:21:53.620]  New York Times promoted plays where Trump's killed and stabbed to death.
[2:21:53.620 --> 2:21:56.620]  And we all know about that.
[2:21:56.620 --> 2:22:01.620]  So this other meme maker who's buddies with Carpe Donkton, it's all listed in the articles.
[2:22:01.620 --> 2:22:06.620]  They got this big conservative conference, the American Priority Conference going this weekend, really popular.
[2:22:06.620 --> 2:22:10.620]  So the New York Times is there for days.
[2:22:10.620 --> 2:22:15.620]  And they have these conferences about not having violence and not letting the left attack you and blah, blah, blah.
[2:22:15.620 --> 2:22:24.620]  And so they go in and find a meme museum display, basically.
[2:22:24.620 --> 2:22:26.620]  And it's a loop of hundreds and hundreds of memes.
[2:22:26.620 --> 2:22:27.620]  And there's this.
[2:22:27.620 --> 2:22:30.620]  So they say, oh, in the video, Trump goes out into a church.
[2:22:30.620 --> 2:22:31.620]  He goes into a church.
[2:22:31.620 --> 2:22:34.620]  The New York Times says it attacks people in a church massacre.
[2:22:34.620 --> 2:22:35.620]  It's the top of the drudge.
[2:22:35.620 --> 2:22:46.620]  Trump critics slaughtered in 2020 pitch screened at Doral Video campaign rocked.
[2:22:46.620 --> 2:22:49.620]  Because people went and rented a conference room.
[2:22:49.620 --> 2:22:52.620]  And then inside conference room, this was being shown.
[2:22:52.620 --> 2:22:58.620]  I mean, this is a top story right now.
[2:22:58.620 --> 2:23:01.620]  So here's the actual video that no one will show you.
[2:23:01.620 --> 2:23:02.620]  Here it is.
[2:23:02.620 --> 2:23:07.620]  Every single American tonight, you should be concerned about what we're learning.
[2:23:07.620 --> 2:23:14.620]  We're talking about abuse of power and corruption at the highest levels of the FBI.
[2:23:14.620 --> 2:23:19.620]  The FBI was pulled.
[2:23:19.620 --> 2:23:24.620]  But figures out tonight show nearly 2,000 children have been separated from their parents
[2:23:24.620 --> 2:23:30.620]  at the U.S.-Mexican border from mid-April through the end of May.
[2:23:30.620 --> 2:23:33.620]  And the mainstream media all gets mad if you're a radio listener.
[2:23:33.620 --> 2:23:34.620]  Oh, dear.
[2:23:34.620 --> 2:23:36.620]  You separate them from their parents.
[2:23:36.620 --> 2:23:41.620]  We're going to rape your son from his mother's arms and throw him in a cage full of pedophiles
[2:23:41.620 --> 2:23:45.620]  and let them have.
[2:23:45.620 --> 2:23:50.620]  That's your fondant.
[2:23:50.620 --> 2:23:53.620]  That's a scene from the movie.
[2:23:53.620 --> 2:23:55.620]  Which promoted church shootings.
[2:23:55.620 --> 2:23:57.620]  Which they know, then you promote that.
[2:23:57.620 --> 2:24:01.620]  It happens.
[2:24:01.620 --> 2:24:03.620]  Let's come back with some Leonard Skinner after this.
[2:24:03.620 --> 2:24:05.620]  Sorry, I'm not grooving out for violence.
[2:24:05.620 --> 2:24:06.620]  I'm grooving out for Leonard Skinner.
[2:24:06.620 --> 2:24:08.620]  I'm going to punch my buttons.
[2:24:08.620 --> 2:24:10.620]  That's it.
[2:24:10.620 --> 2:24:13.620]  You can play Freebird while you're having sex.
[2:24:13.620 --> 2:24:16.620]  Oh, my goodness.
[2:24:16.620 --> 2:24:18.620]  It's good stuff, man.
[2:24:18.620 --> 2:24:22.620]  I'm sorry, family show.
[2:24:22.620 --> 2:24:26.620]  It's nice pairing.
[2:24:26.620 --> 2:24:28.620]  The Hollywood puts out massive violence everywhere.
[2:24:28.620 --> 2:24:31.620]  Calls for Trump's death in a serious way.
[2:24:31.620 --> 2:24:33.620]  I mean, Phil Mudd goes on CNN and says,
[2:24:33.620 --> 2:24:34.620]  we're going to kill this guy.
[2:24:34.620 --> 2:24:36.620]  We're going to stab him in the back.
[2:24:36.620 --> 2:24:37.620]  We're going to stab Giuliani.
[2:24:37.620 --> 2:24:38.620]  That's all OK.
[2:24:38.620 --> 2:24:42.620]  But then it's a joke out of a movie.
[2:24:42.620 --> 2:24:49.620]  And they turn this into Trump rocked.
[2:24:49.620 --> 2:25:01.620]  Because somebody a year ago made this.
[2:25:01.620 --> 2:25:03.620]  I mean, this is Hollywood.
[2:25:03.620 --> 2:25:05.620]  It wants to have sex with our kids.
[2:25:05.620 --> 2:25:09.620]  Telling us that we take what they do and make a joke out of it.
[2:25:09.620 --> 2:25:19.620]  And then suddenly we're not allowed to talk about it.
[2:25:19.620 --> 2:25:21.620]  By the way, I got so hyped up about Project Perotas
[2:25:21.620 --> 2:25:25.620]  and how big this is and how important this is
[2:25:25.620 --> 2:25:26.620]  that I came in and led with it.
[2:25:26.620 --> 2:25:27.620]  Because we had O'Keeffe coming on.
[2:25:27.620 --> 2:25:28.620]  We had technical problems.
[2:25:28.620 --> 2:25:30.620]  He's on next hour.
[2:25:30.620 --> 2:25:32.620]  But I told the crew this morning, like 8 a.m.
[2:25:32.620 --> 2:25:36.620]  I said, this story is being force fed on my wife's phone,
[2:25:36.620 --> 2:25:37.620]  my phone.
[2:25:37.620 --> 2:25:40.620]  And I was staying with friends out at the lake, all their phones.
[2:25:40.620 --> 2:25:43.620]  I turned on TV at like 7 a.m. everywhere.
[2:25:43.620 --> 2:25:45.620]  Trump campaign rocked.
[2:25:45.620 --> 2:25:49.620]  Video put out showing the media all being killed.
[2:25:49.620 --> 2:25:53.620]  Now, this is a real memer.
[2:25:53.620 --> 2:25:54.620]  It's a joke.
[2:25:54.620 --> 2:25:57.620]  But the left could false flag this all day.
[2:25:57.620 --> 2:25:59.620]  They could put, I mean, they could just be small like that.
[2:25:59.620 --> 2:26:03.620]  If indeed it's Trump's fault that somebody put out a meme
[2:26:03.620 --> 2:26:06.620]  off the Kingsman movie.
[2:26:06.620 --> 2:26:08.620]  Show DrudgeReport.com again.
[2:26:08.620 --> 2:26:12.620]  Because Drudge is just actively showing you
[2:26:12.620 --> 2:26:14.620]  what is really going on in the media.
[2:26:14.620 --> 2:26:16.620]  That's what DrudgeReport does, is whatever the zeitgeist is.
[2:26:16.620 --> 2:26:20.620]  And you go anywhere, the top story.
[2:26:20.620 --> 2:26:29.620]  Trump critics slaughtered a 2020 pitch screened at Doral Video.
[2:26:29.620 --> 2:26:36.620]  Campaign rocked.
[2:26:36.620 --> 2:26:39.620]  But what really happened is at infowars.com,
[2:26:39.620 --> 2:26:41.620]  exclusive watch the Trump meme video.
[2:26:41.620 --> 2:26:45.620]  MSN doesn't want you to see Carpe Dongton banned from Twitter.
[2:26:45.620 --> 2:26:47.620]  The New York Times launches an outrage campaign aimed
[2:26:47.620 --> 2:26:51.620]  at meme world contributor and the American Priority Conference.
[2:26:51.620 --> 2:26:55.620]  In fact, I've got the article right here.
[2:26:55.620 --> 2:26:57.620]  This meme video was published on YouTube last year,
[2:26:57.620 --> 2:26:59.620]  but it's now only drawing attention,
[2:26:59.620 --> 2:27:01.620]  leading media pundit Stephen Miller to comment.
[2:27:01.620 --> 2:27:03.620]  It's somehow just a coincidence.
[2:27:03.620 --> 2:27:06.620]  The New York Times wrote a big story about it a week after
[2:27:06.620 --> 2:27:08.620]  The New York Times ran an op-ed about the need for government
[2:27:08.620 --> 2:27:10.620]  regulations of memes.
[2:27:10.620 --> 2:27:12.620]  Here is the video.
[2:27:12.620 --> 2:27:14.620]  They don't want you to see.
[2:27:14.620 --> 2:27:16.620]  Oh, and look, we're about to go to break.
[2:27:16.620 --> 2:27:17.620]  There he is.
[2:27:17.620 --> 2:27:19.620]  Carpe Dongton.
[2:27:19.620 --> 2:27:21.620]  Don't give you his name or they'll come after him.
[2:27:21.620 --> 2:27:22.620]  Let's punch him up.
[2:27:22.620 --> 2:27:23.620]  There he is.
[2:27:23.620 --> 2:27:26.620]  And he knows the evil meme maker that did this.
[2:27:26.620 --> 2:27:30.620]  He's popping in and then Zach and David and Johnny and Peter
[2:27:30.620 --> 2:27:33.620]  and John and Christian Reagan and Bob and Jefferson and CRP.
[2:27:33.620 --> 2:27:36.620]  We're going to all of you ladies and gentlemen on the other
[2:27:36.620 --> 2:27:39.620]  side of this break and we talked to Carpe Dongton.
[2:27:39.620 --> 2:27:41.620]  And then we're going to move back the Bob Bar,
[2:27:41.620 --> 2:27:44.620]  Bill Bar video a little bit later in the hour,
[2:27:44.620 --> 2:27:47.620]  next hour, and then James O'Keeffe is going to be joining us.
[2:27:47.620 --> 2:27:51.620]  Please don't forget, we're running the Everything Must Go Special.
[2:27:51.620 --> 2:27:54.620]  We're selling out of the inventory of our best selling items,
[2:27:54.620 --> 2:27:57.620]  of our moderate items, of items that are all excellent,
[2:27:57.620 --> 2:27:59.620]  that I've never really promoted.
[2:27:59.620 --> 2:28:01.620]  A lot of these supplements we get in, I'm so busy,
[2:28:01.620 --> 2:28:03.620]  I never promote the launch of them,
[2:28:03.620 --> 2:28:06.620]  but there's a lot of great items you should check out,
[2:28:06.620 --> 2:28:10.620]  like X2 and X3, 60 to 70% off.
[2:28:10.620 --> 2:28:14.620]  Body's ultimate turmeric formula is so amazing for inflammation,
[2:28:14.620 --> 2:28:16.620]  your body, your health, it's 50% off.
[2:28:16.620 --> 2:28:20.620]  Ultra 12, 50% off the best B12 you can find anywhere,
[2:28:20.620 --> 2:28:21.620]  under the tongue, amazing.
[2:28:21.620 --> 2:28:24.620]  You want energy, stamina, focus.
[2:28:24.620 --> 2:28:27.620]  Secret 12 was amazing, but when you changed the formula,
[2:28:27.620 --> 2:28:30.620]  we upgraded it, made it even twice as strong, the same B12.
[2:28:30.620 --> 2:28:34.620]  It's now ultra 12, 50% off.
[2:28:34.620 --> 2:28:36.620]  The toothpaste, 50% off.
[2:28:36.620 --> 2:28:40.620]  It's all there, infowarstore.com, 40 to 70% off,

[2:28:44.620 --> 2:28:46.620]  We're back in just a few minutes with Carpe Dongton,
[2:28:46.620 --> 2:28:50.620]  banned off of Twitter, suspended,
[2:28:50.620 --> 2:28:53.620]  not because he was working with folks
[2:28:53.620 --> 2:28:55.620]  that have been implicated in this evil meme.
[2:28:55.620 --> 2:28:56.620]  No, no, no, no.
[2:28:56.620 --> 2:28:59.620]  But because he shared the Project Veritas video,
[2:28:59.620 --> 2:29:21.620]  we'll be right back. Stay with us.
[2:29:29.620 --> 2:29:50.620]  We'll be right back.
[2:29:50.620 --> 2:30:07.620]  I knew it would be hard to top the last big sale
[2:30:07.620 --> 2:30:09.620]  we had Black Friday comes early,
[2:30:09.620 --> 2:30:12.620]  but we've successfully been able to do it.
[2:30:12.620 --> 2:30:15.620]  Black Friday comes early was store-wide free shipping,

[2:30:23.620 --> 2:30:26.620]  Well, the new special we've got is store-wide free shipping,
[2:30:26.620 --> 2:30:33.620]  double-patriot points, and 40 to 70% off all of the supplements
[2:30:33.620 --> 2:30:35.620]  and a whole bunch of other items.
[2:30:35.620 --> 2:30:37.620]  And a lot of these are our best sellers.
[2:30:37.620 --> 2:30:41.620]  Others are sleepers and products that I've just been so busy
[2:30:41.620 --> 2:30:44.620]  I haven't promoted, but they really are amazing.
[2:30:44.620 --> 2:30:47.620]  Find out for yourself. Survival Shield X3,

[2:31:15.620 --> 2:31:19.620]  Now it's easier than ever to have Band.video on your iPhone.
[2:31:19.620 --> 2:31:23.620]  Simply go to Band.video with your Safari browser.
[2:31:23.620 --> 2:31:26.620]  Then you click the Share button at the bottom of the screen.
[2:31:26.620 --> 2:31:30.620]  When the menu comes up, you simply click Add to Home screen.
[2:31:30.620 --> 2:31:32.620]  It will then ask you to name the app.
[2:31:32.620 --> 2:31:34.620]  I suggest Band.video.
[2:31:34.620 --> 2:31:38.620]  You will now have Band.video app on your home screen,
[2:31:38.620 --> 2:31:40.620]  despite the fact that Tim Cook tried to stop it.
[2:31:40.620 --> 2:31:41.620]  The globalists think you're lazy,
[2:31:41.620 --> 2:31:43.620]  but by taking a little bit of action,
[2:31:43.620 --> 2:31:45.620]  you can override them, have the app,
[2:31:45.620 --> 2:31:48.620]  and then tell others about it so they can get the app.
[2:31:48.620 --> 2:31:51.620]  So it's up to you whether you want to defy big tech
[2:31:51.620 --> 2:31:53.620]  and click the Share buttons below.
[2:31:53.620 --> 2:31:55.620]  On your email, on Facebook, on Twitter, on YouTube,
[2:31:55.620 --> 2:32:04.620]  however you want, be sure and share Band.video.
[2:32:25.620 --> 2:32:29.620]  Band.video is evil Americans whose Silicon Valley
[2:32:29.620 --> 2:32:36.620]  is teaching to shut up the China glass.
[2:32:36.620 --> 2:32:40.620]  Hey, I told you, don't go to Band.video.
[2:32:40.620 --> 2:32:42.620]  I'm watching you.
[2:32:42.620 --> 2:32:45.620]  Our system has been adopted worldwide.
[2:32:45.620 --> 2:32:51.620]  Soon we will kill you if you don't do what we say.
[2:32:51.620 --> 2:32:55.620]  Oh, Mark Zuckerberg and others angry at you.
[2:32:55.620 --> 2:32:59.620]  Do what CNN says and do not visit Band.video,
[2:32:59.620 --> 2:33:25.620]  or I have to hurt you.
[2:33:29.620 --> 2:33:35.620]  I can't back down.
[2:33:35.620 --> 2:33:38.620]  I can't turn my children over to the system.
[2:33:38.620 --> 2:33:40.620]  I can't let them take my guns.
[2:33:40.620 --> 2:33:42.620]  I can't let them turn us into Venezuela.
[2:33:42.620 --> 2:33:45.620]  I can't submit to CNN, and the leftists
[2:33:45.620 --> 2:33:48.620]  and the control freaks and kneeler can carpe dongs them.
[2:33:48.620 --> 2:33:50.620]  And that's why their attempt to shut us down
[2:33:50.620 --> 2:33:52.620]  is causing the whistleblowers and others to go public,
[2:33:52.620 --> 2:33:54.620]  but now they've gone into spin.
[2:33:54.620 --> 2:33:57.620]  They've gone into overdrive, and they're trying to imply
[2:33:57.620 --> 2:33:59.620]  these events and these memes and communications
[2:33:59.620 --> 2:34:01.620]  causing violence against the media.
[2:34:01.620 --> 2:34:03.620]  And so we've all got to be silenced The New York Times.
[2:34:03.620 --> 2:34:07.620]  We need memes to be banned like the EU's doing right now.
[2:34:07.620 --> 2:34:10.620]  CNN literally wants to vaporize the truth.
[2:34:10.620 --> 2:34:12.620]  So does The New York Times.
[2:34:12.620 --> 2:34:15.620]  Some of the supporters believe that we are the enemy
[2:34:15.620 --> 2:34:19.620]  of the American people, and that is a really, really awful situation.
[2:34:19.620 --> 2:34:22.620]  We are not the enemy of the American people.
[2:34:22.620 --> 2:34:24.620]  We love the American people.
[2:34:24.620 --> 2:34:27.620]  We love the American people.
[2:34:27.620 --> 2:34:30.620]  We love the American people.
[2:34:30.620 --> 2:34:34.620]  They came in peace.
[2:34:35.380 --> 2:34:37.640]  but we are not the enemy of the American people.
[2:34:37.640 --> 2:34:39.140]  We love the American people.
[2:34:39.140 --> 2:34:41.000]  We love the American people.
[2:34:41.000 --> 2:34:44.020]  We love the American people.
[2:34:44.920 --> 2:34:46.260]  They came in peace.
[2:34:58.820 --> 2:35:01.020]  But we are not the enemy of the American people.
[2:35:01.020 --> 2:35:03.020]  And we love him and our people.
[2:35:07.020 --> 2:35:09.020]  This is CNN.
[2:35:10.020 --> 2:35:12.020]  This is CNN.
[2:35:15.020 --> 2:35:20.020]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[2:35:20.020 --> 2:35:27.020]  I'm going to fly.
[2:35:38.020 --> 2:35:43.020]  Well, it's the top story on Drugsandport.com and it is the top story all over the news.
[2:35:43.020 --> 2:35:45.020]  Campaign Rocked.
[2:35:45.020 --> 2:35:52.020]  While they're saying it's a Trump video, it's a pitch.
[2:35:52.020 --> 2:35:54.020]  A 2020 pitch.
[2:35:54.020 --> 2:35:59.020]  But here with what really went on, he was covering the conference.
[2:35:59.020 --> 2:36:04.020]  His carpe donkdom, you know, carpe donkdom separately has been banned or suspended.
[2:36:04.020 --> 2:36:09.020]  James O'Keefe just tweeted, breaking at carpe donkdom's account has been suspended.
[2:36:09.020 --> 2:36:16.020]  I spoke with Logan Cook who I shared an exclusive clip of CNN with and his account was suspended
[2:36:16.020 --> 2:36:25.020]  immediately upon posting one of the clips where Christian Sierra of CNN discussed coverage of shootings.
[2:36:25.020 --> 2:36:28.020]  So joining us is carpe donkdom.
[2:36:28.020 --> 2:36:30.020]  Carpe donkdom, what do you want to tackle first?
[2:36:30.020 --> 2:36:37.020]  The big top story of the evil memes and it's an old meme being connected to Trump or your suspension?
[2:36:37.020 --> 2:36:42.020]  I guess we could start with where you started.
[2:36:42.020 --> 2:36:46.020]  The meme in question was an old one.
[2:36:46.020 --> 2:36:47.020]  Oh, hold on, sorry.
[2:36:47.020 --> 2:36:49.020]  Can you go back over there?
[2:36:49.020 --> 2:36:51.020]  I got all my kids with me here.
[2:36:51.020 --> 2:36:52.020]  Hey, that's awesome.
[2:36:52.020 --> 2:36:53.020]  Just keep them there.
[2:36:53.020 --> 2:36:54.020]  It's great.
[2:36:54.020 --> 2:36:55.020]  Yeah.
[2:36:55.020 --> 2:36:59.020]  Say hi to Alex.
[2:36:59.020 --> 2:37:00.020]  Hi, Alex.
[2:37:00.020 --> 2:37:01.020]  How are you doing?
[2:37:01.020 --> 2:37:03.020]  Your daddy is a great man.
[2:37:03.020 --> 2:37:11.020]  All right, so, you know, first things, the video was screened.
[2:37:11.020 --> 2:37:13.020]  And well, the screen does not even the right word.
[2:37:13.020 --> 2:37:17.020]  The video was playing in sort of a back room.
[2:37:17.020 --> 2:37:19.020]  We called the hall of memes.
[2:37:19.020 --> 2:37:25.020]  It was just an exhibit that they just had a bunch of different memes, you know, random
[2:37:25.020 --> 2:37:31.020]  assortment of things playing, you know, it was up for three or four hours during the whole
[2:37:31.020 --> 2:37:36.020]  conference and not that many people were really involved in watching it.
[2:37:36.020 --> 2:37:39.020]  It was kind of hidden in the back there.
[2:37:39.020 --> 2:37:50.020]  So the description of a screening or anything like that is complete BS, but it was not endorsed
[2:37:50.020 --> 2:37:51.020]  by anybody.
[2:37:51.020 --> 2:37:54.020]  It was just a collection of memes.
[2:37:54.020 --> 2:38:03.020]  And then as far as the Twitter, Twitter banning, I got a email saying that it was for copyright
[2:38:03.020 --> 2:38:11.020]  infringement, which just to preface that I have I have complied with every single DMCA
[2:38:11.020 --> 2:38:12.020]  takedown I've ever gotten.
[2:38:12.020 --> 2:38:17.020]  I have never reposted a video after it's been taken down because that's a violation of the
[2:38:17.020 --> 2:38:18.020]  takedown order.
[2:38:18.020 --> 2:38:25.020]  I'm very careful about making sure to stick within the rules that are presented by Twitter.
[2:38:25.020 --> 2:38:31.020]  And that should not be happening.
[2:38:31.020 --> 2:38:34.020]  Well, we know that for a while, Veritas couldn't even upload to YouTube.
[2:38:34.020 --> 2:38:37.020]  We know they're blocking it from being the number one term.
[2:38:37.020 --> 2:38:43.020]  They're really, really scared of this bombshell that has come out from Project Veritas.
[2:38:43.020 --> 2:38:45.020]  We've got James will keep joining us next hour.
[2:38:45.020 --> 2:38:50.020]  But getting back to this meme, tell folks who created it, what it gets into is a lot of our
[2:38:50.020 --> 2:38:51.020]  audience is radio.
[2:38:51.020 --> 2:38:52.020]  They can't see it.
[2:38:52.020 --> 2:38:53.020]  It's top linked up on dredgerport.com.
[2:38:53.020 --> 2:38:57.020]  It's obviously linked to the article that you helped us put together with a statement
[2:38:57.020 --> 2:38:59.020]  that's up on info wars.com.
[2:38:59.020 --> 2:39:03.020]  But this is not a campaign video as the media is saying.
[2:39:03.020 --> 2:39:04.020]  No, it's not.
[2:39:04.020 --> 2:39:06.020]  It's not a campaign video at all.
[2:39:06.020 --> 2:39:10.020]  It's done by the Geeks team.
[2:39:10.020 --> 2:39:12.020]  It was done over a year ago.
[2:39:12.020 --> 2:39:15.020]  I had no involvement in the creation of it.
[2:39:15.020 --> 2:39:25.020]  And it's a meme that, first of all, it starts out by, I believe it was one of the fondas
[2:39:25.020 --> 2:39:31.020]  coming over and saying that he's going to put Trump's kids in jail and put them in jail.
[2:39:31.020 --> 2:39:33.020]  Put Baron in a cage with child molesters.
[2:39:33.020 --> 2:39:35.020]  Right, exactly.
[2:39:35.020 --> 2:39:40.020]  And then, you know, the rest of it is just Trump defending himself.
[2:39:40.020 --> 2:39:44.020]  Now, I mean, there's clearly there's a bunch of violence and stuff like that in there.
[2:39:44.020 --> 2:39:49.020]  But, you know, the original context was it was it was a church full of Christians that
[2:39:49.020 --> 2:39:50.020]  were getting shot.
[2:39:50.020 --> 2:39:52.020]  So nobody seemed to have a problem with that.
[2:39:52.020 --> 2:39:56.020]  But exactly Hollywood putting out a church full of Christians being killed.
[2:39:56.020 --> 2:39:58.020]  But that's okay.
[2:39:58.020 --> 2:40:00.020]  But now that somebody sticks Trump's head on it.
[2:40:00.020 --> 2:40:01.020]  Now it's evil.
[2:40:01.020 --> 2:40:03.020]  But meanwhile, the left is all calling for violence.
[2:40:03.020 --> 2:40:05.020]  What about Shakespeare in the park?
[2:40:05.020 --> 2:40:09.020]  The New York Times promoted and said it was okay showing Trump being stabbed to death.
[2:40:09.020 --> 2:40:10.020]  Right.
[2:40:10.020 --> 2:40:18.020]  I believe their headline was something about like how the right or how outrage or how this
[2:40:18.020 --> 2:40:24.020]  how this play got caught up in right wing outrage because it was it was clearly something
[2:40:24.020 --> 2:40:26.020]  that was that was okay to put out there.
[2:40:26.020 --> 2:40:32.020]  But it was just all these mad Republicans that just couldn't handle all the fun of,
[2:40:32.020 --> 2:40:36.020]  you know, Trump getting stabbed by his his cabinet.
[2:40:36.020 --> 2:40:39.020]  Meanwhile, they were trying to get at the cabinet to remove him with the 22nd Amendment.
[2:40:39.020 --> 2:40:41.020]  It turns out at that very time.
[2:40:41.020 --> 2:40:42.020]  Right.
[2:40:42.020 --> 2:40:43.020]  Exactly.
[2:40:43.020 --> 2:40:48.020]  I mean, they were doing everything they could to try to get him removed for for his his mental
[2:40:48.020 --> 2:40:49.020]  impairment.
[2:40:49.020 --> 2:40:53.020]  I believe there's the article how outrage built over Shakespeare's depiction of Trump.
[2:40:53.020 --> 2:40:57.020]  Yeah, where they kill him in a pool of blood takes five minutes for them to stab him to
[2:40:57.020 --> 2:40:58.020]  death.
[2:40:58.020 --> 2:41:02.020]  That's real people on a stage in New York simulating the murder of the president.
[2:41:02.020 --> 2:41:05.020]  This is a meme off something Hollywood already made.
[2:41:05.020 --> 2:41:06.020]  It's just incredible.
[2:41:06.020 --> 2:41:11.020]  And of course, as you point out in the article, a month ago or just a week ago, the New York
[2:41:11.020 --> 2:41:14.020]  Times was saying time to ban memes.
[2:41:14.020 --> 2:41:15.020]  Right.
[2:41:15.020 --> 2:41:16.020]  Yeah.
[2:41:16.020 --> 2:41:21.020]  Well, and they've been trying to do it in in Europe for the last year or two.
[2:41:21.020 --> 2:41:28.020]  I get these DMCA takedowns and there's there's no system with with YouTube.
[2:41:28.020 --> 2:41:33.020]  If you have DMCA takedowns, they give you a certain amount of strikes on Twitter.
[2:41:33.020 --> 2:41:35.020]  They just say, Hey, you got to take down.
[2:41:35.020 --> 2:41:36.020]  Don't worry about it.
[2:41:36.020 --> 2:41:42.020]  And then like today, apparently, they just decided that after I posted literally within
[2:41:42.020 --> 2:41:49.020]  five minutes of posting that scoop from from James, they decided to pull me down for a
[2:41:49.020 --> 2:41:50.020]  copyright strike.
[2:41:50.020 --> 2:41:53.020]  And if that is an election meddling, what is it?
[2:41:53.020 --> 2:41:55.020]  Of course, you have millions of followers.
[2:41:55.020 --> 2:41:57.020]  The president retweets you.
[2:41:57.020 --> 2:42:01.020]  They're scared to death that President Trump's going to retweet the project Veritas scoops.
[2:42:01.020 --> 2:42:04.020]  We should check that as far as I know.
[2:42:04.020 --> 2:42:05.020]  No, not yet.
[2:42:05.020 --> 2:42:08.020]  The last thing he posted was an hour ago, I believe.
[2:42:08.020 --> 2:42:13.020]  Well, so yeah, they've got the president so isolated that if this doesn't get the Don
[2:42:13.020 --> 2:42:16.020]  Jr. Drudge is linked to the announcement.
[2:42:16.020 --> 2:42:20.020]  But if I mean, quite frankly, you know, that's pretty much how Trump gets news is the Drudge
[2:42:20.020 --> 2:42:21.020]  report.
[2:42:21.020 --> 2:42:23.020]  I'm sure he's aware of it now.
[2:42:23.020 --> 2:42:28.020]  I'm sure that's I mean, James, James's tweet.
[2:42:28.020 --> 2:42:33.020]  Yesterday was over 10,000 retweets is a tweet today.
[2:42:33.020 --> 2:42:36.020]  The actual video was crazy.
[2:42:36.020 --> 2:42:41.020]  I mean, it was 4,000 within within five minutes of him posting it.
[2:42:41.020 --> 2:42:44.020]  They put a press release out saying 100,000 of one tweet.
[2:42:44.020 --> 2:42:46.020]  I want to finish up on where you think this is all going.
[2:42:46.020 --> 2:42:51.020]  And I got to get back to your day job was just running memeworld.com and take care of
[2:42:51.020 --> 2:42:52.020]  those two great young boys.

[2:42:54.020 --> 2:42:59.020]  I even know what's under there.
[2:42:59.020 --> 2:43:03.020]  Are you that's a Millennium Falcon target shirt, isn't it?
[2:43:03.020 --> 2:43:04.020]  Yes, it is.

[2:44:04.020 --> 2:44:09.020]  Communist China quietly bought up Hollywood more than a decade ago and they've been approving
[2:44:09.020 --> 2:44:14.020]  almost all the scripts that you see on television or in the movies for many years.
[2:44:14.020 --> 2:44:16.020]  And now they own our debt.
[2:44:16.020 --> 2:44:18.020]  Now they own the Democratic Party.
[2:44:18.020 --> 2:44:22.020]  Now they've merged Silicon Valley to censor patriots off the air.
[2:44:22.020 --> 2:44:26.020]  Washington Post comes out and says they hope that Gigi Ping, the dictator of China will
[2:44:26.020 --> 2:44:28.020]  quote destroy Trump.
[2:44:28.020 --> 2:44:29.020]  That's a headline.
[2:44:29.020 --> 2:44:33.020]  So info wars has been the Paul Revere of this operation.
[2:44:33.020 --> 2:44:37.020]  We have blown the whistle continuously and have been proven right.
[2:44:37.020 --> 2:44:41.020]  And that's why it's more important than ever that we override Silicon Valley and their
[2:44:41.020 --> 2:44:47.020]  chai-kong masters by word of mouth and spread the word about info wars and check out infowarstore.com.
[2:44:47.020 --> 2:44:50.020]  That's where the arsenal of our republic is being funded.

[2:47:31.020 --> 2:47:38.020]  Live from Austin, Texas, it's Alex Jones.

[2:49:31.020 --> 2:50:00.020]  We'll see you next time.
[2:50:02.020 --> 2:50:04.020]  Where is this going?
[2:50:04.020 --> 2:50:06.020]  It's going the same place it's always been going.
[2:50:06.020 --> 2:50:08.020]  They want us all censored.
[2:50:08.020 --> 2:50:13.020]  They want us all removed from social media so they have their little echo chamber that
[2:50:13.020 --> 2:50:17.020]  they can keep filling up with lies.
[2:50:17.020 --> 2:50:23.020]  But I think that the suspension has something to do with Veritas.
[2:50:23.020 --> 2:50:30.020]  Literally five minutes before I was suspended, I tweeted out a video that James sent me,
[2:50:30.020 --> 2:50:37.020]  a scoop that nobody else had that was about CNN saying they don't care about shootings
[2:50:37.020 --> 2:50:41.020]  unless it happens in a neighborhood that they don't care about gang shootings,
[2:50:41.020 --> 2:50:44.020]  unless it happens in an affluent neighborhood.
[2:50:44.020 --> 2:50:49.020]  Unless it happens on, this is a quote, unless it happens on Cory Booker's block,
[2:50:49.020 --> 2:50:51.020]  they don't care about Chicago shootings.
[2:50:51.020 --> 2:50:56.020]  So this is all just part of it.
[2:50:56.020 --> 2:51:04.020]  I think that the video controversy yesterday was, they knew that this was coming out,
[2:51:04.020 --> 2:51:06.020]  the Veritas stuff.
[2:51:06.020 --> 2:51:11.020]  I think they knew it was going to hit hard and they wanted to create a quick controversy
[2:51:11.020 --> 2:51:15.020]  and they found one.
[2:51:15.020 --> 2:51:20.020]  And this is just going to keep going on until somebody addresses it.
[2:51:20.020 --> 2:51:25.020]  And really the only somebody that can address it is Congress and Trump himself.
[2:51:25.020 --> 2:51:27.020]  I totally agree with you.
[2:51:27.020 --> 2:51:29.020]  Do you have any inside baseballs?
[2:51:29.020 --> 2:51:31.020]  I know you rub shoulders with a lot of people.
[2:51:31.020 --> 2:51:33.020]  You travel more than I do.
[2:51:33.020 --> 2:51:35.020]  But I mean, why Trump hasn't done anything yet?
[2:51:35.020 --> 2:51:42.020]  And A, and then B, why Drudge seems to be getting upset with him.
[2:51:42.020 --> 2:51:47.020]  I don't have any inside baseball on Drudge or really what's going on in the White House,
[2:51:47.020 --> 2:51:50.020]  you know, as far as that's concerned.
[2:51:50.020 --> 2:52:01.020]  I do rub shoulders with a lot of people and I think everyone is waiting for Trump to take the reins
[2:52:01.020 --> 2:52:04.020]  and really start going after these people.
[2:52:04.020 --> 2:52:06.020]  You know, I've talked to several congressmen.
[2:52:06.020 --> 2:52:16.020]  I talked to four or five congressmen probably in the last month about this issue.
[2:52:16.020 --> 2:52:24.020]  And I think that they're starting to see how big of a deal this is.
[2:52:24.020 --> 2:52:32.020]  And I think that getting the GOP leadership to start recognizing it is going to be an important part of moving forward
[2:52:32.020 --> 2:52:38.020]  because, you know, Trump is going to need the support of Congress when he does this.
[2:52:38.020 --> 2:52:43.020]  Otherwise, you know, like with all this impeachment stuff that they're trying to do,
[2:52:43.020 --> 2:52:47.020]  if he doesn't have the support of the GOP and he doesn't have the support of Congress,
[2:52:47.020 --> 2:52:52.020]  anything that he does can be spun into a new way of impeaching him
[2:52:52.020 --> 2:52:55.020]  that can say that it's overreach of power, all those things.
[2:52:55.020 --> 2:53:01.020]  And if you have those guys like Mitt Romney in there that are willing to flip on him in just a second,
[2:53:01.020 --> 2:53:04.020]  it's going to be bad.
[2:53:04.020 --> 2:53:07.020]  I mean, I don't know if you've watched the whole Veritas thing in there,
[2:53:07.020 --> 2:53:16.020]  but CNN is CNN talks about going after Lindsey Graham because Lindsey Graham hasn't been friendly enough to them.
[2:53:16.020 --> 2:53:22.020]  So I mean, we played what the 16 minutes last hour into this hour.
[2:53:22.020 --> 2:53:28.020]  And CNN has a hit list and everybody that's conservative is on it.
[2:53:28.020 --> 2:53:34.020]  And if you think that you're safe because you've been friendly to CNN, you are dead wrong.
[2:53:34.020 --> 2:53:38.020]  They want Trump gone. They want us all gone.
[2:53:38.020 --> 2:53:44.020]  And the gloves are going to come off here because CNN is just, they're gasping for breath.
[2:53:44.020 --> 2:53:48.020]  Well, that's right. Everything is committed now to get rid of Trump.
[2:53:48.020 --> 2:53:50.020]  If they can't get rid of Trump, they fail.
[2:53:50.020 --> 2:53:54.020]  And that's why this battle is so, so close.
[2:53:54.020 --> 2:53:58.020]  And that's why people's action in their word of mouth, spreading the word, spreading your articles, your videos,
[2:53:58.020 --> 2:54:01.020]  our information, memeworld.com.
[2:54:01.020 --> 2:54:04.020]  Getting to a point where the only place you can find the memes is memeworld.com.
[2:54:04.020 --> 2:54:09.020]  The only place you can find the forbidden videos is Bandot video.
[2:54:09.020 --> 2:54:11.020]  And it's just beyond critical.
[2:54:11.020 --> 2:54:16.020]  I've had probably 20 videos taken down this year for DMCA.
[2:54:16.020 --> 2:54:22.020]  And I did want to say, you know, I actually found which video was the last one that they took down.
[2:54:22.020 --> 2:54:28.020]  It was a Super Bowl commercial from 2018 that did not have any copyrighted content.
[2:54:28.020 --> 2:54:33.020]  It was broadcast to, you know, 45 million people during the Super Bowl.
[2:54:33.020 --> 2:54:41.020]  And I had not added, I added like a three second sound bite at the end that they could have said was copyrighted.
[2:54:41.020 --> 2:54:43.020]  But the entire thing was not copyrighted.
[2:54:43.020 --> 2:54:47.020]  Sure. They're using copyright, the EU and all of them say to destroy free speech.
[2:54:47.020 --> 2:54:52.020]  Matt Drudge came here four years ago in the studio and warned they were going to use copyright to take things down.
[2:54:52.020 --> 2:54:55.020]  He was told by a Supreme Court justice and that's what they're doing.
[2:54:55.020 --> 2:54:58.020]  And if you folks that don't know, a commercial is free to air.
[2:54:58.020 --> 2:55:00.020]  It's a promotional, it's open for critique.
[2:55:00.020 --> 2:55:02.020]  Everyone's always done it.
[2:55:02.020 --> 2:55:04.020]  It's one of the most protected things out there.
[2:55:04.020 --> 2:55:11.020]  So what you're saying is the fact that you couldn't show an old ad just to show context shows that they are abusing it.
[2:55:11.020 --> 2:55:14.020]  It was posted in February of 2018.
[2:55:14.020 --> 2:55:18.020]  It's, I mean, we're, it's almost two years old already.
[2:55:18.020 --> 2:55:20.020]  Yeah, they're going through everything.
[2:55:20.020 --> 2:55:21.020]  They're banning everything.
[2:55:21.020 --> 2:55:22.020]  It's a total war.
[2:55:22.020 --> 2:55:24.020]  They want to silence the average American.
[2:55:24.020 --> 2:55:26.020]  Absolutely. They do.
[2:55:26.020 --> 2:55:36.020]  And you know what the they're doing a good job of it because Twitter does not have a system in place where you can appeal these things.
[2:55:36.020 --> 2:55:46.020]  The only way to appeal it is you have to send all of your private information to a third party and request that they rescind their takedown order.
[2:55:46.020 --> 2:55:47.020]  It's like the old story.
[2:55:47.020 --> 2:55:50.020]  You have to request from the people to try to get you.
[2:55:50.020 --> 2:55:52.020]  You have to request it from them.
[2:55:52.020 --> 2:55:54.020]  And if they say no, there's no recourse.
[2:55:54.020 --> 2:55:55.020]  That's it.
[2:55:55.020 --> 2:55:57.020]  You have to get a lawyer involved and go sue UMG.
[2:55:57.020 --> 2:55:59.020]  Like I'm going to go sue you.
[2:55:59.020 --> 2:56:00.020]  And Carpe don't them.
[2:56:00.020 --> 2:56:14.020]  Let's not forget that this is all being done in a climate where the mainstream media is adopting Chinese Communist style censorship and promoting that as if it's a good thing and letting the left run rough shot and tell any lies they want do anything they want.
[2:56:14.020 --> 2:56:15.020]  It's so dangerous.
[2:56:15.020 --> 2:56:23.020]  And then now even President Trump had right side broadcasting simply shows his speeches banned off Facebook.
[2:56:23.020 --> 2:56:26.020]  So if Trump won't stand up for that, he won't stand up for anything.
[2:56:26.020 --> 2:56:31.020]  But as you said, it was the pressure put on Twitter that made them put your tweet back up your account back up.
[2:56:31.020 --> 2:56:32.020]  So let's keep doing that.
[2:56:32.020 --> 2:56:35.020]  We'll check in with you as this unfolds memeworld.com.
[2:56:35.020 --> 2:56:38.020]  And on Twitter for now, people can also find you there.
[2:56:38.020 --> 2:56:39.020]  Thank you, Carpe.
[2:56:39.020 --> 2:56:40.020]  Thank you, man.
[2:56:40.020 --> 2:56:41.020]  Powerful interview.
[2:56:41.020 --> 2:56:42.020]  Okay.
[2:56:42.020 --> 2:56:45.020]  Listeners, thanks for holding for the last 45 minutes.
[2:56:45.020 --> 2:56:49.020]  I'm going to come back and I'm going to go bam, bam, bam to your calls.
[2:56:49.020 --> 2:56:53.020]  David and Jefferson and Bob and CRP and everybody else.
[2:56:53.020 --> 2:56:56.020]  I'm going bam, bam, bam to your calls.
[2:56:56.020 --> 2:56:58.020]  We come back briefly.
[2:56:58.020 --> 2:57:03.020]  Since I mentioned it, here's Bill Maher talking about Joe Biden's stock is quickly depreciating.
[2:57:03.020 --> 2:57:04.020]  No kidding.
[2:57:04.020 --> 2:57:05.020]  Here it is.
[2:57:05.020 --> 2:57:06.020]  I like Joe.
[2:57:06.020 --> 2:57:07.020]  He never my favorite.
[2:57:07.020 --> 2:57:13.020]  But if he's the guy to beat Trump, I was like, let's not kill him because if he's the one.
[2:57:13.020 --> 2:57:18.020]  But I must say my confidence that he can beat Trump is waning.
[2:57:18.020 --> 2:57:21.020]  He looks like a depreciating stock to me.
[2:57:21.020 --> 2:57:38.020]  I'm not trying to get Joe out, but we do need someone in the center who's a younger and female.
[2:57:38.020 --> 2:57:59.020]  I know most of you realize this, but I'm going to say it again very, very clearly.
[2:57:59.020 --> 2:58:03.020]  You are just as important as I am or the rest of the crew at Info Wars.
[2:58:03.020 --> 2:58:09.020]  You are the individuals that have done the research to understand the global spattle plan and we know how to take them down.
[2:58:09.020 --> 2:58:11.020]  That's why they're so upset.
[2:58:11.020 --> 2:58:13.020]  Think how far we've come together.
[2:58:13.020 --> 2:58:23.020]  You know, even if we were losing, we'd all still keep fighting on because the right thing to do against the truly satanic forces of the New World Order who've really taken the mask off.
[2:58:23.020 --> 2:58:25.020]  The lines in the sand for everybody now.
[2:58:25.020 --> 2:58:30.020]  But you'd already chosen to fight the corruption and to stand with God and to stand with the unborn.
[2:58:30.020 --> 2:58:36.020]  I just want to take time out again to salute the audience because you are truly activist in the arena.
[2:58:36.020 --> 2:58:44.020]  And without you and your prayers and your word of mouth and your financial support, this operation that you built, that your operation would not be here.
[2:58:44.020 --> 2:58:49.020]  We've got some giant specials running right now at inforwarsstore.com. A lot of items, 50% off.
[2:58:49.020 --> 2:58:55.020]  Please take advantage of it at inforwarsstore.com to help us fight even harder into the future.
[2:58:55.020 --> 2:59:00.020]  China was already running the United States. You're like, well, China could never take it with the U.S.
[2:59:00.020 --> 2:59:01.020]  That's right.
[2:59:01.020 --> 2:59:11.020]  As the Roman historian and Senator Cicero warned, a powerful empire can't fall from without before it first falls from within.
[2:59:11.020 --> 2:59:15.020]  So yes, they're coming for your guns, all of them.
[2:59:15.020 --> 2:59:17.020]  Yes, they're coming for your children.
[2:59:17.020 --> 2:59:24.020]  They've already taken your speech almost everywhere except pockets of resistance like inforwars.com and band.video.
[2:59:24.020 --> 2:59:28.020]  So now you know why I'm so upset. Now you know why I'm so angry.
[2:59:28.020 --> 2:59:32.020]  I saw the producers of South Park on TV. They're totally pissing angry.
[2:59:32.020 --> 2:59:39.020]  People are like, why are they angry? Because they see all of their freedom, their American freedom, hard fought, taken away.
[2:59:39.020 --> 2:59:43.020]  Are you going to get upset? Well, you're a listener. You're obviously already upset.
[2:59:43.020 --> 2:59:51.020]  But you've got to ring the alarm everywhere until others, they've got to get upset and then take action and let Congress, everybody else know that we're not backing down
[2:59:51.020 --> 2:59:54.020]  and we're not going to sell America out to the chicoms.
[2:59:57.020 --> 3:00:02.020]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:00:02.020 --> 3:00:26.020]  Okay, here's what we're going to do. I open the phones up on the topic of impeachment, the lawlessness, the end of due process, the media calling for memes to be banned.
[3:00:26.020 --> 3:00:35.020]  The project Veritas bombshell being censored and blocked. It's up on inforwars.com. But the first caller I'm going to take is from Ireland.
[3:00:35.020 --> 3:00:46.020]  Because I just always love how people will find a way to bring theologian type stuff into any discussion.
[3:00:46.020 --> 3:00:57.020]  So we'll go to Joseph first, wants to talk about Inquisition. Well, tell me about the Spanish Inquisition or which Inquisition is this? The Jesuit Inquisition?
[3:00:57.020 --> 3:01:04.020]  And then what's my view on the Inquisition? Please tell me, welcome Joseph from Ireland.
[3:01:04.020 --> 3:01:16.020]  Hi, Alex. I agree with most of what you say and the times are in. It's just that I've often listened to you talking about the Inquisition.
[3:01:16.020 --> 3:01:38.020]  And as a Catholic, having studied the Inquisition, of course, the Communist, God hating, Muslim loving BBC, who when they finally looked into the records, sorry, of the Inquisition, they had to admit that 99% of what you know about the Inquisition is incorrect.
[3:01:38.020 --> 3:01:49.020]  The Inquisition came about because of the Islamic slaughter of the Catholics in the Iberian Peninsula. And the Catholics fought back for 600 years.
[3:01:49.020 --> 3:01:59.020]  The women were raped. There was huge Harlees, probably the largest in the world. And when they finally got the Muslims out, there was a whole lot of them that refused to convert.
[3:01:59.020 --> 3:02:14.020]  They asked, leave or convert. And they said, oh, most of them left, but some of them pretended to convert. And that's why the Inquisition came about. And the Catholics could not leave a fifth column there, knowing that Islam was just up across the water in North Africa.
[3:02:14.020 --> 3:02:23.020]  And would come back again and do exactly what they did to them. So I don't like it as a Catholic. Can you use the Inquisition as a means of...
[3:02:23.020 --> 3:02:31.020]  Well, I think I've used the term Inquisition to talk about a persecution investigation, because that's the popular use of it.
[3:02:31.020 --> 3:02:51.020]  Yeah, but I think Alex, I mean, first of all, I'm not against you. I'm saying this as a Catholic. That's one thing I don't agree with, though, is because the Inquisition was born out of Islamic terror inflicted upon the Catholics of Christian Spain who fought for 600 years.
[3:02:51.020 --> 3:03:04.020]  Well, no, I know the Larissa case took 600 years. I know that's how the Inquisition started. But it's just like having anything like that. Then, you know, I mean, I think you would agree that the people carrying out the Inquisition were not infallible, right?
[3:03:04.020 --> 3:03:06.020]  And so I'm sure they made mistakes.
[3:03:06.020 --> 3:03:15.020]  Yeah, there was mistakes made. But an actual fact, when the records were shown, opened, they now realize most people, there wasn't huge amounts of torture.
[3:03:15.020 --> 3:03:22.020]  Hey, listen, you know, Hutton Gibson, he's a big traditional Catholic. He told me all about this, and I looked into some of the history, and I did find some of that.
[3:03:22.020 --> 3:03:30.020]  I'm talking about some of the religious wars between Catholics and Protestants and other, you know, stuff that came later. But look, I understand where you're coming from.
[3:03:30.020 --> 3:03:37.020]  I know all about the LaRica and Quista, and it's very, very interesting. And I know that part of what you're talking about is accurate.
[3:03:37.020 --> 3:03:47.020]  But people always ask me, why do you use the term pirate radio when it's micro or it's low power? The general public thinks of an unlicensed station as a pirate.
[3:03:47.020 --> 3:03:55.020]  And then I have to use the term pirate so they mentally know what I'm talking about. Then I explain that a lot of pirate stations really aren't pirates because they're not interfering with commercial stations.
[3:03:55.020 --> 3:04:02.020]  Then I believe we should have more community radio and more independent. But if I don't use the word pirate, most people don't know what I'm talking about.
[3:04:02.020 --> 3:04:09.020]  So whatever your views are on different, you know, inquisitions and things that went on using that term, that's the Spanish term, isn't it?
[3:04:09.020 --> 3:04:14.020]  Or that's the Catholic term, it's the inquisition. But I understand you're saying it as a negative. I mean, I have another caller here.
[3:04:14.020 --> 3:04:22.020]  Once I was to stop calling him the media. Well, he's right. The media is not the media. What do you call it then?
[3:04:22.020 --> 3:04:30.020]  Alex, also, that's the point I wanted to make. But the other point I wanted to make was, right? And again, I buy your product. I listen to you a lot of days.
[3:04:30.020 --> 3:04:33.020]  Thanks for the sport.
[3:04:33.020 --> 3:04:44.020]  We don't have news here in Ireland, OK? Ireland has fallen to radical socialism. We're gone, OK? We were once a Christian country.
[3:04:44.020 --> 3:04:49.020]  We now have voted to murder our children. And every taxpayer has to pay for it.
[3:04:49.020 --> 3:04:58.020]  But the last thing I wanted to make was, what is going on in the Catholic Church right now is going to have a direct impact on the whole world.
[3:04:58.020 --> 3:05:00.020]  And it is in.
[3:05:00.020 --> 3:05:03.020]  No, I totally agree with you. You've got to call me back another time as we're on other topics.
[3:05:03.020 --> 3:05:07.020]  But I've got to really hand it to the listeners and viewers who have been forced.
[3:05:07.020 --> 3:05:14.020]  Your support and your help in rebooting Americana is a challenge to the globalist system of corporate tyranny.
[3:05:14.020 --> 3:05:18.020]  It has really caught hold, not just here in the U.S. but worldwide.
[3:05:18.020 --> 3:05:25.020]  And President Trump's fearlessness when it comes to promoting Americana and basic liberty is amazing as well.
[3:05:25.020 --> 3:05:30.020]  He's still lacking on the big tech censorship, taking action against that in some other areas.
[3:05:30.020 --> 3:05:36.020]  But trying to end the wars, boosting our economy, speaking out against communist China, Trump's been doing an amazing job.
[3:05:36.020 --> 3:05:43.020]  But now more than ever, we really have to realize that we're being targeted because we are effective.
[3:05:43.020 --> 3:05:48.020]  And the globalists are beginning to lose their war against humanity in a big way.
[3:05:48.020 --> 3:05:56.020]  And so we're going to see some major fireworks out of them. But it's critical to not let ourselves get down when we see all the poison they spray at us.
[3:05:56.020 --> 3:06:21.020]  That's an attempt to moralize us. We've got to remember that and stay focused and stay happy.
[3:06:21.020 --> 3:06:26.020]  Okay, we have an incredibly jam-packed fourth hour and I'm going to hit it all.
[3:06:26.020 --> 3:06:29.020]  I'm going to take at least nine or ten calls that are on the board.
[3:06:29.020 --> 3:06:33.020]  We have Project Veritas James O'Keefe joining us at the bottom of the hour.
[3:06:33.020 --> 3:06:40.020]  And I have 15 clips of Attorney General Barr saying incredible things.
[3:06:40.020 --> 3:06:44.020]  I'm only going to have time to play six of them.
[3:06:44.020 --> 3:06:48.020]  But that's coming up too. This is just amazing stuff, he said.
[3:06:48.020 --> 3:06:53.020]  The Democrats are organized evil that want to hurt our children and our pedophiles.
[3:06:53.020 --> 3:06:57.020]  I mean, it's just, it's true. But now this really shows Trump's going after them.
[3:06:57.020 --> 3:07:01.020]  And that's why all, you know what's breaking loose right now.
[3:07:01.020 --> 3:07:13.020]  There's also other video up on infowars.com of Democrat globalist producers at CNN admitting that they cover up shootings in Democrat controlled areas of blacks
[3:07:13.020 --> 3:07:20.020]  and only focus on mass shootings that will pull on people's heartstrings. A very racist statement.
[3:07:20.020 --> 3:07:26.020]  I mean, this is incredible. So that's up on infowars.com. I mean, this is, this news day is just too much.
[3:07:26.020 --> 3:07:29.020]  But let's go to your calls right now.
[3:07:29.020 --> 3:07:35.020]  David in New York, thanks for holding. You're on the air. Go ahead.
[3:07:35.020 --> 3:07:39.020]  I do believe we need to stop calling the media, the media.
[3:07:39.020 --> 3:07:45.020]  What they are, Alex, and you know this is they are the CIA mouthpiece and the CIA and the NSA.
[3:07:45.020 --> 3:07:51.020]  And you've had many guests have talked about this. They've been infiltrated and taken over by a communistic mindset.
[3:07:51.020 --> 3:07:55.020]  Because I think they put their money with China that that's where the power is going to be in the future.
[3:07:55.020 --> 3:08:01.020]  So they're attacking now and they're trying to take all our rights away, especially to hear people like you and others.
[3:08:01.020 --> 3:08:04.020]  So what President Trump needs to do, and I will support him, Alex.
[3:08:04.020 --> 3:08:10.020]  Well, he calls them the enemy, he calls them crooked, but you have to identify them as the media or the average person doesn't know.
[3:08:10.020 --> 3:08:16.020]  I mean, I guess you say that big thing they call the mainstream media are really a bunch of foreign traders.
[3:08:16.020 --> 3:08:19.020]  He should start calling them Chai-Com minions.
[3:08:19.020 --> 3:08:21.020]  Absolutely. And right now I'm playing chess, listening to you.
[3:08:21.020 --> 3:08:28.020]  Donald Trump's a great chess player. He needs to make the big move. Alex, he needs to call them out, call them what they are.
[3:08:28.020 --> 3:08:35.020]  Up the ante, say they are been infiltrated with CIA rogue agents trying to take over and hijack the culture of our country.
[3:08:35.020 --> 3:08:40.020]  And we're going to lose it if we don't make the big piece move, get the Queens out, the bishops and attack.
[3:08:40.020 --> 3:08:42.020]  Attack their former communication.
[3:08:42.020 --> 3:08:48.020]  Take away their ways to communicate and neutralize that to make it a play, a fair playing field.
[3:08:48.020 --> 3:08:56.020]  People like you and others can get out and have an equal access to information so we can keep the culture and keep the war in a winning state.
[3:08:56.020 --> 3:08:59.020]  Because I believe Alex will lose them, unfortunately.
[3:08:59.020 --> 3:09:02.020]  We got to win this thing or we're going to lose the country.
[3:09:02.020 --> 3:09:05.020]  I totally agree. Here's an article from Red State.
[3:09:05.020 --> 3:09:11.020]  New York Times writer acknowledges the existence of the deep state has written a book called The Deep State,
[3:09:11.020 --> 3:09:18.020]  which says it's private intelligence groups and government intelligence groups that are not doing what Trump says and trying to overthrow them to protect us.
[3:09:18.020 --> 3:09:26.020]  So it's a mutiny of globalists that say America sucks telling us they're going to overthrow our president and now trying to normalize it,
[3:09:26.020 --> 3:09:30.020]  which means they're trying to get ready to get us to accept actually doing it.
[3:09:30.020 --> 3:09:33.020]  Think how dangerous and how crazy that is.
[3:09:33.020 --> 3:09:35.020]  Absolutely. We need President Trump.
[3:09:35.020 --> 3:09:38.020]  If you can hear this, please stand up, make the big move.
[3:09:38.020 --> 3:09:40.020]  Make the big move, neutralize them.
[3:09:40.020 --> 3:09:43.020]  Free up Congress and the Republicans to take them out in a fair way.
[3:09:43.020 --> 3:09:48.020]  I heard him say, listen to the judge, Jeanine, that the problem with the Republicans is they play fair.
[3:09:48.020 --> 3:09:51.020]  They play on an equal playing field. The Democrats don't do that.
[3:09:51.020 --> 3:09:53.020]  We got to change our whole modus operandi.
[3:09:53.020 --> 3:09:56.020]  You just hit the key here. We never start lying like they do.
[3:09:56.020 --> 3:09:58.020]  We never start hurting innocent people.
[3:09:58.020 --> 3:10:02.020]  But they're not on the regular political system now.
[3:10:02.020 --> 3:10:05.020]  They're saying kill the president, hurt his supporters.
[3:10:05.020 --> 3:10:08.020]  They're lying. They're threatening people.
[3:10:08.020 --> 3:10:10.020]  They're working for foreign governments.
[3:10:10.020 --> 3:10:13.020]  They're violating the law. They're bragging how they're violating it.
[3:10:13.020 --> 3:10:19.020]  Saying we're the guardians of America by trying to overthrow the president and by doing all this.
[3:10:19.020 --> 3:10:24.020]  And so they've launched these attacks. They're in a mutiny. They're in a sedition.
[3:10:24.020 --> 3:10:28.020]  Yes, Alex. The information is there. Now the move has got to be made.
[3:10:28.020 --> 3:10:30.020]  It's no longer getting the information out.
[3:10:30.020 --> 3:10:34.020]  Now it's about a tactical move to stop them from doing it.
[3:10:34.020 --> 3:10:40.020]  I'll say this. It telegraphs weakness to have two of Giuliani's barely associates campaign finance.
[3:10:40.020 --> 3:10:43.020]  Nothing hurriedly indicted just because they're going after Biden.
[3:10:43.020 --> 3:10:46.020]  But then Trump can't get anybody indicted on his end. I appreciate your call.
[3:10:46.020 --> 3:10:49.020]  And again, there is a McCabe indictment.
[3:10:49.020 --> 3:10:53.020]  That's confirmed, but they won't pull the damn trigger on it.
[3:10:53.020 --> 3:10:56.020]  And so we're all sitting here in the middle of this war.
[3:10:56.020 --> 3:10:59.020]  Go ahead and bring me the article. It's okay. Bring it on up here. Thank you.
[3:10:59.020 --> 3:11:02.020]  We're all in the middle of this thing right here. Thank you, sir.
[3:11:02.020 --> 3:11:07.020]  And it's on. Look at these articles.
[3:11:07.020 --> 3:11:13.020]  Seeing an employee confesses that MSM ignores shootings in minority communities.
[3:11:13.020 --> 3:11:14.020]  That's a, that's a quote.
[3:11:14.020 --> 3:11:21.020]  Can you imagine if there was undercover video of me saying ignore stuff in minority communities?
[3:11:21.020 --> 3:11:28.020]  You know, I remember that black lady six, seven years ago ran into a checkpoint in D.C. with her baby.
[3:11:28.020 --> 3:11:32.020]  And she drove around scared and the police shot her dad in front of the Capitol.
[3:11:32.020 --> 3:11:36.020]  And I got upset and so did Michael Savage simultaneously.
[3:11:36.020 --> 3:11:39.020]  And I had all these letters and black people calling me a big one.
[3:11:39.020 --> 3:11:42.020]  I thought you didn't like black people because you didn't like Obama.
[3:11:42.020 --> 3:11:45.020]  Thank you for caring that she's a black lady.
[3:11:45.020 --> 3:11:49.020]  And I was like, I don't care what color she is. That's wrong.
[3:11:49.020 --> 3:11:53.020]  Just like the cop that shot the innocent woman up in Fort Worth.
[3:11:53.020 --> 3:11:58.020]  That guy was new on the force. He's a greenhorn idiot. Charging with manslaughter.
[3:11:58.020 --> 3:12:01.020]  When the stuff's cut and dry, man, there's bad cops.
[3:12:01.020 --> 3:12:10.020]  But I would never think about what color somebody is when they're being wronged.
[3:12:10.020 --> 3:12:14.020]  I mean, I just, but that's the left. They obsess over it, folks.
[3:12:14.020 --> 3:12:18.020]  Because the left is not liberals.
[3:12:18.020 --> 3:12:20.020]  The founders were liberal. They wanted more freedom.
[3:12:20.020 --> 3:12:24.020]  Liberal just means horseshoe size cream, not one.
[3:12:24.020 --> 3:12:28.020]  More guns, more money, more freedom. Liberals, liberal.
[3:12:28.020 --> 3:12:33.020]  Left hand path is satanic, is deception.
[3:12:33.020 --> 3:12:36.020]  And the left comes out of devil worship.
[3:12:36.020 --> 3:12:41.020]  That's mainline history. The French Revolution were devil worshipers.
[3:12:41.020 --> 3:12:45.020]  Going back to your calls, but seeing an employee caught undercover video.
[3:12:45.020 --> 3:12:49.020]  It's on infowars.com. Read the whole article.
[3:12:49.020 --> 3:12:54.020]  It's huge. Here's just part of the tidbits flowing out. Here it is.
[3:12:54.020 --> 3:12:55.020]  It's in New Jersey now.
[3:12:55.020 --> 3:12:56.020]  Princeton.
[3:12:56.020 --> 3:13:02.020]  Princeton. Okay, let's say in Princeton, a white kid gets shot at Princeton University.
[3:13:02.020 --> 3:13:07.020]  He's walking. He's visiting his big brother, who's a student there.
[3:13:07.020 --> 3:13:09.020]  He gets shot in the head. He gets killed.
[3:13:09.020 --> 3:13:16.020]  We're going to get coverage on that because, oh my God, we have the precious little wink.
[3:13:16.020 --> 3:13:19.020]  But three people get shot in the head.
[3:13:19.020 --> 3:13:27.020]  Nobody cares. Nobody. Nobody cares, maybe, unless it happens before you book his block.
[3:13:27.020 --> 3:13:31.020]  They always say nobody cares. No, you're making them not care.
[3:13:31.020 --> 3:13:33.020]  You choose when to make people care.
[3:13:33.020 --> 3:13:37.020]  And you choose when to blame law-abiding gun owners for what some crazy does.
[3:13:37.020 --> 3:13:44.020]  When you know statistically it's still super rare, but you know you're making mass shootings more common by hyping those.
[3:13:44.020 --> 3:13:48.020]  And then ignoring things like South Side Chicago, South Side Dallas,
[3:13:48.020 --> 3:13:53.020]  where the government was shipping the drugs in, George Herbert Walker Bush ran it,
[3:13:53.020 --> 3:13:57.020]  and then he created the whole dynasty of the Clintons, all of it, flowed out of him.
[3:13:57.020 --> 3:14:00.020]  The Rockefeller Republican, the globalist.
[3:14:00.020 --> 3:14:02.020]  Let's take another call.
[3:14:02.020 --> 3:14:13.020]  CRP, calling from Washington State. CRP, come on down. Welcome.
[3:14:13.020 --> 3:14:15.020]  Can you hear me, Alex?
[3:14:15.020 --> 3:14:18.020]  I sure can. Go ahead, CRP.
[3:14:18.020 --> 3:14:24.020]  I just want you and your listeners to remember one thing.
[3:14:24.020 --> 3:14:38.020]  Glory, glory, hallelujah. Glory, glory, hallelujah. Glory, glory, hallelujah.
[3:14:38.020 --> 3:14:41.020]  His truth is marching on, you know.
[3:14:41.020 --> 3:14:44.020]  Trump, I know we're going to sing this right now, man, but,
[3:14:44.020 --> 3:14:47.020]  Trump, they did a great job at the 4th of July doing that.
[3:14:47.020 --> 3:14:50.020]  That was really a pro-America ritual that was carried out.
[3:14:50.020 --> 3:14:53.020]  Is that where you're going with this?
[3:14:53.020 --> 3:14:58.020]  No, I'm just, everything is being shouted from the rooftop.
[3:14:58.020 --> 3:15:03.020]  Everything that's being done secret is being let go, and we're hearing about it,
[3:15:03.020 --> 3:15:07.020]  and God's truth is going on in America.
[3:15:07.020 --> 3:15:11.020]  You know, I agree with you that this is the process of hitting bottom,
[3:15:11.020 --> 3:15:17.020]  and now the enemy knows their time is short, so he sends the beast with wrath.
[3:15:17.020 --> 3:15:19.020]  I'm sorry?
[3:15:19.020 --> 3:15:26.020]  The devil knows his time is short, so he sends the beast with wrath.
[3:15:26.020 --> 3:15:29.020]  All I know is we are here to advance the kingdom.
[3:15:29.020 --> 3:15:32.020]  I believe America has turned her heart back to God,
[3:15:32.020 --> 3:15:37.020]  and there is going to be another few generations where we have grace and peace in our land.
[3:15:37.020 --> 3:15:39.020]  The best is yet to come.
[3:15:39.020 --> 3:15:41.020]  Well, CRP, I think that's definitely coming.
[3:15:41.020 --> 3:15:42.020]  Thank you so much.
[3:15:42.020 --> 3:15:43.020]  What do we have to go through?
[3:15:43.020 --> 3:15:44.020]  More calls.
[3:15:44.020 --> 3:15:48.020]  The bill bar clips that go exactly what CRP just said and more.
[3:15:48.020 --> 3:15:52.020]  But first, we got to go through the devil.
[3:15:52.020 --> 3:15:54.020]  We better have on the armor of God.
[3:15:54.020 --> 3:15:56.020]  Infowars.com.

[3:17:29.020 --> 3:17:58.020]  We'll be right back with another video on this primitive survival tool.

[3:18:20.020 --> 3:18:27.020]  Now, Turmeric has been known for thousands of years to help with inflammation,
[3:18:27.020 --> 3:18:31.280]  to help with inflammation, headaches, it's good for the immune system, so many things.
[3:18:31.280 --> 3:18:33.200]  It sells itself.
[3:18:33.200 --> 3:18:41.640]  But normal turmerics only has 3-5% curcuminoid, the active enzyme or system in the plant.

[3:19:02.680 --> 3:19:07.640]  The globalists have been planning to make their move on America for decades and decades.
[3:19:07.640 --> 3:19:12.200]  Hillary was supposed to get in and complete the takeover, the censorship, all of it.
[3:19:12.200 --> 3:19:16.640]  That's why they took me off the air first and banned me across the internet because
[3:19:16.640 --> 3:19:21.280]  they knew that what we were saying was dead on and they didn't want us raising the alarm.
[3:19:21.280 --> 3:19:22.280]  Well, guess what?
[3:19:22.280 --> 3:19:26.440]  So you spread the word, instead of fastly supporting InfoWars, we're still on the air

[3:20:06.200 --> 3:20:25.160]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:20:25.160 --> 3:20:28.640]  Well, as you can see, it's a mission impossible to defeat the globalists, but we really even
[3:20:28.640 --> 3:20:29.640]  have a choice.
[3:20:29.640 --> 3:20:33.880]  We're trying to run our lives and totally take us over.
[3:20:33.880 --> 3:20:38.240]  I'm going back to your calls here in just a moment, and I've talked a lot about this,
[3:20:38.240 --> 3:20:40.320]  but we need this to sink in.
[3:20:40.320 --> 3:20:46.080]  In almost every case now, if it's a political story of the New York Times or CNN or MSNBC
[3:20:46.080 --> 3:20:51.400]  or The Washington Post, you can bet it's totally fake.
[3:20:51.400 --> 3:20:52.800]  And you go, but they've been caught lying.
[3:20:52.800 --> 3:20:53.800]  They should quit.
[3:20:53.800 --> 3:20:56.760]  No, they just get more outrageous.
[3:20:56.760 --> 3:21:03.320]  Kurt Eichenwald, a senior New York Times writer, posted a 1983 image of a child earthquake
[3:21:03.320 --> 3:21:07.720]  victims to bash Trump over Syria pullout.
[3:21:07.720 --> 3:21:15.840]  Now, he'll probably get an award for doing that, but people now know anything you see.
[3:21:15.840 --> 3:21:16.840]  Go check it.
[3:21:16.840 --> 3:21:17.840]  Go video search it.
[3:21:17.840 --> 3:21:22.680]  Go image search it, and it's not true.
[3:21:22.680 --> 3:21:24.440]  They're all trying to outdo each other.
[3:21:24.440 --> 3:21:25.440]  Here's an example.
[3:21:25.440 --> 3:21:26.440]  Wow.
[3:21:26.440 --> 3:21:27.440]  It's on InfoWars.com.
[3:21:27.440 --> 3:21:29.520]  Gateway Pundit had an article as well.
[3:21:29.520 --> 3:21:36.520]  ABC News uses 2016 gun range video and lies to pass it off as Turkey bombing the Kurds
[3:21:36.520 --> 3:21:39.040]  in Syria.
[3:21:39.040 --> 3:21:40.440]  They know they're lying.
[3:21:40.440 --> 3:21:45.000]  Used to even 20 years ago, if journalists got caught doing fake stuff, they'd be out
[3:21:45.000 --> 3:21:47.240]  of business.
[3:21:47.240 --> 3:21:49.480]  Now they get rewards.
[3:21:49.480 --> 3:21:54.480]  ABC attempts to pass off gun range footage as combat footage from Syria to blame Trump.
[3:21:54.480 --> 3:21:58.080]  Here is the edited footage they showed of people having fun at a gun range blowing up
[3:21:58.080 --> 3:21:59.920]  some cans of gasoline and tannerite.
[3:21:59.920 --> 3:22:02.160]  Hell, I've gone out and done that.
[3:22:02.160 --> 3:22:07.200]  And then they turn that into what the Turks were doing.
[3:22:07.200 --> 3:22:13.360]  I mean, this is premeditated lying as institutions with the Veritas video out right now.
[3:22:13.360 --> 3:22:16.160]  Here's the ABC's lying to you.
[3:22:16.160 --> 3:22:20.920]  This video right here appearing to show Turkey's military bombing Kurd civilians in a Syrian
[3:22:20.920 --> 3:22:22.000]  border town.
[3:22:22.000 --> 3:22:25.800]  The Kurds who fought alongside the U.S. against ISIS.
[3:22:25.800 --> 3:22:33.200]  Now horrific reports of atrocities committed by Turkish fact fighters on those very allies.
[3:22:33.200 --> 3:22:36.800]  Now let's go ahead and show that it was a machine gun shootout.
[3:22:36.800 --> 3:22:57.360]  Let's go ahead and show the real footage.
[3:22:57.360 --> 3:22:59.400]  Machine gun shootout.
[3:22:59.400 --> 3:23:05.880]  Notice that ABC had to turn the light levels down to obscure the trees in the background.
[3:23:05.880 --> 3:23:10.640]  To make it look like it was on a much bigger scale like a whole city was being vaporized
[3:23:10.640 --> 3:23:17.080]  by war of the world's Martian attack ships.
[3:23:17.080 --> 3:23:22.920]  So that's a bunch of machine guns, hundreds of people lined up, having fun to get some
[3:23:22.920 --> 3:23:23.920]  fun video.
[3:23:23.920 --> 3:23:25.680]  And boy, that does look fun.
[3:23:25.680 --> 3:23:31.720]  But they shoot in a 50 cal and you put tracer ammo in there and you shoot like you just
[3:23:31.720 --> 3:23:36.000]  go out to the real Steiner Ranch, not the housing development, but change Steiner's real
[3:23:36.000 --> 3:23:37.000]  12,000 acre ranch.
[3:23:37.000 --> 3:23:40.640]  They since sold it here, I'd be out there right now.
[3:23:40.640 --> 3:23:45.480]  And he's got some vistas that are like 4,000 yards and you shoot one of those like an old
[3:23:45.480 --> 3:23:48.480]  barrel or an old truck like a photon torpedo from Star Trek.
[3:23:48.480 --> 3:23:53.400]  And it would boom and you just see a shh that hit that, that might as well bounce up too.
[3:23:53.400 --> 3:23:55.280]  You'd see the tracer go up.
[3:23:55.280 --> 3:23:56.280]  So that's Knob Creek.
[3:23:56.280 --> 3:23:57.280]  They know what it is.
[3:23:57.280 --> 3:23:58.280]  They get it.
[3:23:58.280 --> 3:24:00.800]  They turn the light level way down so you only see the flames.
[3:24:00.800 --> 3:24:06.880]  So you don't see everybody with their phones videotaping Knob Creek.
[3:24:06.880 --> 3:24:10.120]  They just blow it up, do that and then deceive their enemy.
[3:24:10.120 --> 3:24:14.520]  The American people because they have a peacemaking president trying to get us out of a hundred
[3:24:14.520 --> 3:24:16.200]  year war the Kurds have been having with each other.
[3:24:16.200 --> 3:24:17.760]  The Kurds are in a civil war now.
[3:24:17.760 --> 3:24:18.960]  That's what Rand Paul's come out and said.
[3:24:18.960 --> 3:24:19.960]  Of course they are.
[3:24:19.960 --> 3:24:22.800]  The Kurds are just another group running around trying to take over.
[3:24:22.800 --> 3:24:25.880]  They tell the troops, oh, the Kurds are Christians.
[3:24:25.880 --> 3:24:26.880]  Another not.
[3:24:26.880 --> 3:24:29.560]  I mean, just everything our military has told us lies.
[3:24:29.560 --> 3:24:31.920]  And now under Trump, the troops coming out.
[3:24:31.920 --> 3:24:33.120]  So there you go.
[3:24:33.120 --> 3:24:34.960]  That was not the Turks attacking.
[3:24:34.960 --> 3:24:38.240]  That was Knob Creek machine gun shootout.
[3:24:38.240 --> 3:24:45.440]  Okay, let's go to Jefferson in Virginia.
[3:24:45.440 --> 3:24:46.440]  Jefferson here on the air.
[3:24:46.440 --> 3:24:47.440]  Thanks for holding.
[3:24:47.440 --> 3:24:48.440]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[3:24:48.440 --> 3:24:50.160]  Thanks for having me on.
[3:24:50.160 --> 3:24:51.160]  Welcome.
[3:24:51.160 --> 3:24:53.160]  What's your view?
[3:24:53.160 --> 3:24:59.520]  Well, I think the project Veritas revelation is important for people to understand.
[3:24:59.520 --> 3:25:02.720]  But it just confirms what most of us already knew.
[3:25:02.720 --> 3:25:05.320]  And there's a whole generation of kids that just don't care.
[3:25:05.320 --> 3:25:09.080]  We're trying to wake up two generations of Americans that are just so black-pilled in
[3:25:09.080 --> 3:25:12.440]  their ignorance that they just don't care what the truth is anymore.
[3:25:12.440 --> 3:25:13.440]  Exactly.
[3:25:13.440 --> 3:25:17.520]  There's a new phenomenon where, especially millennials, the study show, but I've seen
[3:25:17.520 --> 3:25:19.920]  it go, I don't care if you have proof it's not true.
[3:25:19.920 --> 3:25:21.280]  I want to believe it.
[3:25:21.280 --> 3:25:25.000]  And then they do it to feel official and like they're part of the power structure, even
[3:25:25.000 --> 3:25:27.520]  though they're not.
[3:25:27.520 --> 3:25:29.960]  But it's Orwellian, it's ignorance and strength.
[3:25:29.960 --> 3:25:34.120]  They're so out of it that they just think it's strong to not care.
[3:25:34.120 --> 3:25:39.120]  When it comes to Brad Parscale and Internet censorship, it annoys me that he seems to
[3:25:39.120 --> 3:25:45.760]  think that your right to free speech is a different thing from the ability to be heard.
[3:25:45.760 --> 3:25:50.360]  He's okay with your being restricted to a smaller audience than you deserve.
[3:25:50.360 --> 3:25:53.440]  Well, he feels like they're winning.
[3:25:53.440 --> 3:25:57.360]  He's talking about dynasties and, you know, I mean, it's just, it's delusional.
[3:25:57.360 --> 3:25:59.000]  I mean, we're in the middle of a war.
[3:25:59.000 --> 3:26:02.040]  They're persecuting everybody, and I want to see action.
[3:26:02.040 --> 3:26:03.040]  This is racketeering.
[3:26:03.040 --> 3:26:04.040]  This is election meddling.
[3:26:04.040 --> 3:26:06.400]  This is total industrial level persecution.
[3:26:06.400 --> 3:26:07.400]  They've lied to Congress.
[3:26:07.400 --> 3:26:09.400]  And so I want to see action now.
[3:26:09.400 --> 3:26:10.400]  God bless you, Jefferson.
[3:26:10.400 --> 3:26:11.400]  Thanks for the great point.
[3:26:11.400 --> 3:26:14.400]  Bob in Oregon, thanks for holding your on the air.
[3:26:14.400 --> 3:26:19.000]  Hi, Alex, first time caller, a long time listener.
[3:26:19.000 --> 3:26:20.560]  Pleasure to be on your show, sir.
[3:26:20.560 --> 3:26:21.560]  Thank you, sir.
[3:26:21.560 --> 3:26:25.200]  I'm going to try to make my points quickly out of respect for the time of the other
[3:26:25.200 --> 3:26:26.200]  callers.
[3:26:26.200 --> 3:26:30.760]  The scariest thing about the Project Veritas Exposay of CNN is that we live in an environment
[3:26:30.760 --> 3:26:34.800]  where they think, and it's indicative of all those in power who are lying, they think they
[3:26:34.800 --> 3:26:37.960]  can get away with all the bias and not get caught.
[3:26:37.960 --> 3:26:41.960]  As I see it, back in the good old days, facts were what mattered.
[3:26:41.960 --> 3:26:44.040]  Facts does have a debate about facts.
[3:26:44.040 --> 3:26:46.360]  Then it moved to spinning facts.
[3:26:46.360 --> 3:26:50.120]  The facts matter, but let's spin those facts and start manipulating facts.
[3:26:50.120 --> 3:26:55.520]  Now we live in an environment where facts no longer matter, spin is the only thing.
[3:26:55.520 --> 3:27:00.600]  And you've talked about this, this spinning facts no matter only works in an environment
[3:27:00.600 --> 3:27:05.080]  where the First Amendment is stifled by manipulation of Google, shaming and banning those who express
[3:27:05.080 --> 3:27:06.480]  their ideas.
[3:27:06.480 --> 3:27:09.640]  The other thing that's going on, though, and I've been thinking about this, and it's
[3:27:09.640 --> 3:27:13.040]  like one of those scary things you think about, it's so right in front of you, you don't
[3:27:13.040 --> 3:27:17.480]  realize it until you think about it, is that the kids who grew up on the internet, there's
[3:27:17.480 --> 3:27:19.040]  a built-in apathy.
[3:27:19.040 --> 3:27:22.920]  Kids treat knowledge the way I used to do when I was growing up, and calculators came
[3:27:22.920 --> 3:27:23.920]  out.
[3:27:23.920 --> 3:27:27.000]  If I had to do the math myself, I'm going to use the calculator.
[3:27:27.000 --> 3:27:29.560]  The calculator will do the math for me.
[3:27:29.560 --> 3:27:32.880]  Kids are so passive with information, they're like, I don't need to know anything, I'll
[3:27:32.880 --> 3:27:34.320]  just look it up on the internet.
[3:27:34.320 --> 3:27:40.040]  So there's a built-in apathy by that fact, and to me, the only solution is what you're
[3:27:40.040 --> 3:27:41.040]  doing with Infowars.
[3:27:41.040 --> 3:27:42.960]  I love the title of Infowars.
[3:27:42.960 --> 3:27:45.160]  Let's have a battle of ideas.
[3:27:45.160 --> 3:27:48.640]  Let's have the ideas that are best went out.
[3:27:48.640 --> 3:27:53.640]  That way, at least we're evolving the society to ideas that beat out other ideas, and we're
[3:27:53.640 --> 3:27:54.640]  moving somewhere.
[3:27:54.640 --> 3:27:55.640]  Oh, I totally agree with you.
[3:27:55.640 --> 3:28:00.920]  When I used to have to go down to the UT Library 20 years ago to find David Rockefeller
[3:28:00.920 --> 3:28:05.440]  worshipping Mao, it was like I had gold, and the audience was blown away.
[3:28:05.440 --> 3:28:08.400]  Now it's like, okay, big deal, he supports mass murder.
[3:28:08.400 --> 3:28:13.400]  It's an apathy because they don't appreciate anything.
[3:28:13.400 --> 3:28:14.400]  Exactly right.
[3:28:14.400 --> 3:28:18.000]  And one thing I loved on your show recently is when you had the debate with TI, and I
[3:28:18.000 --> 3:28:20.320]  think we needed to see more of that.
[3:28:20.320 --> 3:28:22.200]  We need to see opponents for the first amendment.
[3:28:22.200 --> 3:28:23.200]  I agree.
[3:28:23.200 --> 3:28:27.640]  We need to see people who even radically disagree with us, but who believe in the first amendment.
[3:28:27.640 --> 3:28:30.720]  Whether it's like a Bill Maher type, he might be a bad example, but sometimes you talked
[3:28:30.720 --> 3:28:31.720]  about how...
[3:28:31.720 --> 3:28:33.120]  Oh, I'd love to get Bill Maher on.
[3:28:33.120 --> 3:28:34.120]  I'd love to go on his show.
[3:28:34.120 --> 3:28:38.160]  I disagree with what he says, but he says, I should have my free speech, and he defended
[3:28:38.160 --> 3:28:39.160]  me.
[3:28:39.160 --> 3:28:40.160]  Hey, great, great caller, Bob.
[3:28:40.160 --> 3:28:43.760]  I'm going to bring the show back soon with some of our best callers co-hosting with me.
[3:28:43.760 --> 3:28:44.760]  So let's get his name and number.
[3:28:44.760 --> 3:28:46.760]  I should have got the last few people, too.
[3:28:46.760 --> 3:28:48.840]  First, we're having a special show every week.
[3:28:48.840 --> 3:28:49.840]  We've beta tested it.
[3:28:49.840 --> 3:28:53.240]  People like it, where we have four or five special callers on to really be able to flush
[3:28:53.240 --> 3:28:54.240]  things out.
[3:28:54.240 --> 3:28:55.240]  So thank you, Bob.
[3:28:55.240 --> 3:28:57.760]  We've got a bunch of other callers, but I've got James O'Keefe scheduled next segment,
[3:28:57.760 --> 3:29:00.440]  and then I've got the Bill Barr clips that nobody's heard yet.
[3:29:00.440 --> 3:29:01.440]  Stay with us.
[3:29:01.440 --> 3:29:06.080]  My fellow freedom lovers, I'm very excited to bring you Vaso Beats.
[3:29:06.080 --> 3:29:10.760]  I've been wanting a beat formula for years because they're popular, they're best sellers,
[3:29:10.760 --> 3:29:13.080]  because people like them and they really work.

[3:29:18.160 --> 3:29:20.960]  healthy blood vessels, the list goes on and on.
[3:29:20.960 --> 3:29:23.360]  Cardiovascular and heart health support is one of the biggest.

[3:30:37.720 --> 3:30:38.720]  to stop it.
[3:30:38.720 --> 3:30:42.840]  The globalists think you're lazy, but by taking a little bit of action, you can override them,
[3:30:42.840 --> 3:30:47.080]  have the app, and then tell others about it so they can get the app.

[3:31:08.160 --> 3:31:13.160]  nowhere and that we've changed the world together and just how important your actions and my

[3:35:16.880 --> 3:35:20.840]  up on screen. We're waiting for him very busy person to get in
[3:35:20.840 --> 3:35:23.600]  the seat here and give us the latest on the censorship, the
[3:35:23.600 --> 3:35:27.560]  latest on the attacks, the latest to try to suppress this
[3:35:27.560 --> 3:35:30.480]  latest bombshell that I'm saying is probably the biggest
[3:35:30.480 --> 3:35:32.920]  thing they've ever done reportedly hundreds and hundreds
[3:35:32.920 --> 3:35:38.760]  and hundreds of hours inside CNN, the CEO of CNN, Jeff Zucker,
[3:35:39.040 --> 3:35:42.480]  admitting it's all political, all of it. It's just simply
[3:35:42.480 --> 3:35:46.320]  crazy. And the mission impeach President Trump. There he is.
[3:35:46.320 --> 3:35:49.120]  All right, James O'Keefe, you've been working hard. We've only
[3:35:49.120 --> 3:35:52.120]  got a few minutes here with us. So tell us about this story.
[3:35:52.240 --> 3:35:54.400]  What's already come out and what we can expect to come out.
[3:35:54.400 --> 3:35:57.600]  And thanks for joining us. Thanks, Alex. Alex, this is an
[3:35:57.600 --> 3:36:02.320]  extraordinary story. We we have hundreds of hours of tapes
[3:36:02.320 --> 3:36:07.720]  within CNN, recorded not by one of my full time employees or
[3:36:07.720 --> 3:36:10.520]  journalists, but an insider who blew the whistle on CNN. This
[3:36:10.520 --> 3:36:13.920]  man's name is Kerry Porch. He was a technician at the network
[3:36:13.920 --> 3:36:18.200]  worked with producers worked on the floor, drove trucks. And
[3:36:18.200 --> 3:36:22.160]  he's recorded Alex Jeff Zucker's editorial meetings every
[3:36:22.160 --> 3:36:25.400]  day. He got access to these meetings and Jeff Zucker is on
[3:36:25.400 --> 3:36:29.720]  the phone getting irate, attacking Fox News, attacking
[3:36:29.720 --> 3:36:34.240]  Fox News is conspiracy, saying we need to push impeachment. His
[3:36:34.240 --> 3:36:38.000]  own staffers were recorded Alex. These are these are CNN
[3:36:38.000 --> 3:36:41.320]  employees saying that Jeff Zucker is on an anti Trump
[3:36:41.320 --> 3:36:44.760]  vendetta and saying they don't really report the news. One of
[3:36:44.760 --> 3:36:48.600]  these employees, Mike Brevna says quote, CNN sold themselves
[3:36:48.600 --> 3:36:52.520]  to the devil. So it's pretty extraordinary tape. And it's
[3:36:52.520 --> 3:36:57.240]  just part one. It's just part one. We've also seen a lot of
[3:36:57.240 --> 3:37:00.040]  attempts to suppress this already with Carpe Donkton and
[3:37:00.040 --> 3:37:03.920]  others being taken off Twitter. Yes, this is this is actually
[3:37:03.920 --> 3:37:07.840]  there's some new pieces of information. Carpe Donkton,
[3:37:07.840 --> 3:37:10.800]  everyone knows him. He's the big, big meme guy on Twitter. I
[3:37:10.800 --> 3:37:13.640]  gave him an exclusive clip, which I'll send to you, Alex, as
[3:37:13.640 --> 3:37:17.240]  well. We haven't even released it yet of the CNN employee
[3:37:17.240 --> 3:37:19.440]  talking about how they don't cover school shootings in
[3:37:19.440 --> 3:37:23.800]  inner cities. They only cover them in white areas. Carpe
[3:37:23.800 --> 3:37:26.760]  Donkton tweeted this video out and Twitter took his account
[3:37:26.760 --> 3:37:30.040]  down. I'm not sure why they said it was a copyright
[3:37:30.040 --> 3:37:34.120]  violation. So we'll get this to your guys and make sure you have
[3:37:34.120 --> 3:37:36.200]  that clip as well. I'm not sure why they're not banning the
[3:37:36.200 --> 3:37:39.480]  CNN employees who made the statements. But everything is
[3:37:39.480 --> 3:37:43.080]  all the things are happening, Alex. YouTube wouldn't let us
[3:37:43.080 --> 3:37:45.760]  upload the clip. My website keeps crashing because Drudge is
[3:37:45.760 --> 3:37:50.200]  linking to it. So I sent Drudge the YouTube links. You know,
[3:37:50.200 --> 3:37:52.440]  this is all we're taking on the most powerful people in the
[3:37:52.440 --> 3:37:56.520]  world, but Jeff Zucker has been exposed. And we're looking for
[3:37:56.520 --> 3:37:59.640]  a comment. If your audience can tweet the video out, send it
[3:37:59.640 --> 3:38:03.560]  out, email it out. It's the hashtag exposed CNN and the
[3:38:03.560 --> 3:38:06.120]  video is there it is. There it is on your screen. CNN employee
[3:38:06.120 --> 3:38:08.600]  confesses that mainstream media ignores shootings in minority
[3:38:08.600 --> 3:38:11.720]  communities. This is the video that got banned from Twitter. I'm
[3:38:11.720 --> 3:38:15.000]  not sure why these are CNN employees making these statements.
[3:38:15.000 --> 3:38:17.480]  Well, we were able to get it from Carpe now and it is up on
[3:38:17.480 --> 3:38:20.920]  infowars.com and you're right. That is so sensational. If
[3:38:20.920 --> 3:38:24.040]  Trump said something like that, he'd be done. I wouldn't
[3:38:24.040 --> 3:38:26.520]  support him. You wouldn't either. But when they do it,
[3:38:26.520 --> 3:38:28.920]  they're trying to suppress it. No wonder. I mean, that it's got
[3:38:28.920 --> 3:38:31.960]  it's got to scare them and reportedly you you've got a
[3:38:31.960 --> 3:38:35.560]  lot more than just this. Yeah, we have more employees. We have
[3:38:35.560 --> 3:38:38.680]  the vice presidents on tape. There's a debate coming tomorrow.
[3:38:38.680 --> 3:38:41.720]  They've made some statements about candidates. I think one of
[3:38:41.720 --> 3:38:43.800]  the most remarkable things about this story I think I've
[3:38:43.800 --> 3:38:48.520]  never seen before is the bravery of this guy who who came up to
[3:38:48.520 --> 3:38:51.320]  me at one of these events and said, James, I work for a
[3:38:51.320 --> 3:38:54.360]  three letter news organization and he whispered in my work
[3:38:54.360 --> 3:38:58.280]  for CNN. I want you to give me a camera, which we did and he
[3:38:58.280 --> 3:39:03.400]  is as of today still employed through CNN. He's a technician
[3:39:03.400 --> 3:39:08.200]  there. Alex, I'm waiting to get a response or reaction. Jeff
[3:39:08.200 --> 3:39:12.040]  Zucker did comment this morning. Alex, Kerry went to work,
[3:39:12.040 --> 3:39:15.560]  recorded the editorial meeting and Jeff Zucker was visibly
[3:39:15.560 --> 3:39:18.440]  disturbed. I don't know if you have that audio, but we just
[3:39:18.440 --> 3:39:20.680]  released it this morning. We did air it this morning and once
[3:39:20.680 --> 3:39:23.160]  we this is alive, but once we're done, we're going to put
[3:39:23.160 --> 3:39:25.880]  your interview up with all this added to it. This is amazing.
[3:39:25.880 --> 3:39:28.760]  And and and he already sounded upset saying it was no big deal
[3:39:28.760 --> 3:39:32.280]  move along. But imagine when he discovers that your guy, not
[3:39:32.280 --> 3:39:34.440]  your guy, but the whistleblower that came to you was still
[3:39:34.440 --> 3:39:37.400]  there this morning. Wow. Still he still went to work. He went
[3:39:37.400 --> 3:39:40.200]  to work. This is the number one trending tease in the in
[3:39:40.200 --> 3:39:44.200]  United States. It was exposed. CNN was the number 200,000
[3:39:44.200 --> 3:39:48.680]  tweets, 200,000 tweets. The engineers in Silicon Valley
[3:39:48.680 --> 3:39:51.880]  aren't able to suppress this because there's an uprising.
[3:39:51.880 --> 3:39:54.680]  And so what happens is the insider goes to work this
[3:39:54.680 --> 3:39:59.080]  morning, goes to the editorial meeting and records it today
[3:39:59.080 --> 3:40:02.440]  this morning. And he gets Jeff Zucker on the tape saying,
[3:40:02.440 --> 3:40:06.040]  Oh, there's this project Veritas. Don't don't worry. Everyone
[3:40:06.040 --> 3:40:09.560]  just do your jobs. He's visibly upset about what is
[3:40:09.560 --> 3:40:12.920]  happening. We got him, Alex. We got him dead to rights.
[3:40:12.920 --> 3:40:16.200]  They're their their biases is clear. It's amazing. We have
[3:40:16.200 --> 3:40:19.960]  the president of a news network pushing a political
[3:40:19.960 --> 3:40:24.120]  narrative on the phone with his deputies. It's all recorded.
[3:40:24.120 --> 3:40:26.920]  We've suspected, but now we can prove it thanks to the hero
[3:40:26.920 --> 3:40:31.320]  heroism of this insider. Just recapping when he reached out
[3:40:31.320 --> 3:40:34.840]  to you. I mean, the amount of video you reportedly got. I
[3:40:34.840 --> 3:40:37.640]  mean, how long is it going to take to dole all this out?
[3:40:37.640 --> 3:40:43.880]  I don't know. Hundreds of hours of tape. We usually release
[3:40:43.880 --> 3:40:47.880]  them in installments because you don't want to jump on your
[3:40:47.880 --> 3:40:50.440]  own lead. You want to have a story at a time. Otherwise,
[3:40:50.440 --> 3:40:52.680]  you just you just trip over yourself with the amount of
[3:40:52.680 --> 3:40:56.040]  content here, but a drudge isn't linked in red on the top.
[3:40:56.040 --> 3:41:00.200]  Drudge even posted a picture of of of of of Kerry porch, the
[3:41:00.200 --> 3:41:03.480]  insider next to Wolf Blitzer. There it is right there. You
[3:41:03.480 --> 3:41:06.920]  could see his picture. What a patriot and and I'm going to
[3:41:06.920 --> 3:41:10.280]  read a quote Alex that was I almost teared up. I'm
[3:41:10.280 --> 3:41:14.200]  interviewing the guy on a TV set and and and Kerry says the
[3:41:14.200 --> 3:41:17.320]  following. I say to him, you know, why did you do this?
[3:41:17.320 --> 3:41:20.600]  You're about to be a father. His fiance is pregnant and he
[3:41:20.600 --> 3:41:23.640]  said I did it to save the Republic. He said I did it to
[3:41:23.640 --> 3:41:27.640]  save the Republic. That's that's I mean, I don't even have
[3:41:27.640 --> 3:41:31.080]  words. I mean, and he's not a Republican. He's a Democrat.
[3:41:31.080 --> 3:41:34.520]  This guy's he voted for he voted for Bernie Sanders, but he
[3:41:34.520 --> 3:41:38.920]  said I came to CNN because I wanted to be a news guy and it
[3:41:38.920 --> 3:41:41.320]  became my nightmare. That's what he told. Well, it's like
[3:41:41.320 --> 3:41:44.360]  Robert Epstein is a liberal professor, but he sees the
[3:41:44.360 --> 3:41:46.920]  election fraud. He had to go public or you know, all these
[3:41:46.920 --> 3:41:49.400]  other whistleblowers. It's just it's it's crazy. This has
[3:41:49.400 --> 3:41:52.760]  got to really scare the deep state. James O'Keefe. I think
[3:41:52.760 --> 3:41:56.200]  it scares them because it's they it's they're it's they're not
[3:41:56.200 --> 3:42:00.440]  doing it for commercial gain or they're they're not grifters.
[3:42:00.440 --> 3:42:04.280]  These people are the real deal of his guy did it because he
[3:42:04.280 --> 3:42:07.480]  really believed I got to know him over the course of many
[3:42:07.480 --> 3:42:10.680]  months and he was scared. But he said I did it for my country
[3:42:10.680 --> 3:42:12.840]  and he doesn't know what's going to happen to him. He
[3:42:12.840 --> 3:42:16.280]  unemployed, maybe not not ever hired again and he and he said,
[3:42:16.280 --> 3:42:19.400]  you know what? It's worth it to me. Now, I think he should
[3:42:19.400 --> 3:42:22.360]  start a GoFundMe page. I will help him do that. If he gets
[3:42:22.360 --> 3:42:26.760]  sued, Alex, I will pay it. I will find a way. So, help me
[3:42:26.760 --> 3:42:29.960]  God to raise the money to pay his legal bill. Let me ask you
[3:42:29.960 --> 3:42:31.560]  this. We got you on a little bit late. If you gotta go
[3:42:31.560 --> 3:42:33.080]  understand, you can come back tomorrow, but please try to
[3:42:33.080 --> 3:42:36.200]  hold over. But I gotta ask you now, is this probably is the
[3:42:36.200 --> 3:42:39.400]  biggest story out of huge ones you've ever broke or is or or
[3:42:39.400 --> 3:42:42.200]  is it something else? I think it's been the biggest story
[3:42:42.200 --> 3:42:44.840]  because of what it is and who did it, Alex. I gotta go
[3:42:44.840 --> 3:42:47.560]  because I gotta keep producing, but thank you very much and
[3:42:47.560 --> 3:42:50.280]  keep keep keep at it. Keep pushing the videos out and more
[3:42:50.280 --> 3:42:53.400]  videos coming. Yes, sir. More coming. We're producing the
[3:42:53.400 --> 3:42:55.800]  next installment as I speak. Alright, James, I'll keep
[3:42:55.800 --> 3:42:58.520]  thank you. Wow. And and Bill Barr came out and said the
[3:42:58.520 --> 3:43:02.120]  Democrats are Satanist. We'll play that next. I've got to
[3:43:02.120 --> 3:43:04.520]  really hand it to the listeners and viewers who
[3:43:04.520 --> 3:43:08.440]  enforce. Your support and your help in rebooting
[3:43:08.440 --> 3:43:11.880]  Americana is a challenge to the globalist system of
[3:43:11.880 --> 3:43:15.080]  corporate tyranny has really caught hold not just here in
[3:43:15.080 --> 3:43:18.680]  the US but worldwide and President Trump's fearlessness
[3:43:18.680 --> 3:43:22.280]  when it comes to promoting Americana and basic liberty
[3:43:22.280 --> 3:43:25.800]  is amazing as well. He's still lacking on the big tech
[3:43:25.800 --> 3:43:28.520]  censorship, taking action against that in some other
[3:43:28.520 --> 3:43:31.480]  areas, but trying to end the wars, boosting our economy,
[3:43:31.480 --> 3:43:34.280]  speaking out against communist China. Trump's been doing an
[3:43:34.280 --> 3:43:37.720]  amazing job, but now more than ever, we really have to
[3:43:37.720 --> 3:43:41.160]  realize that we're being targeted because we are
[3:43:41.160 --> 3:43:44.600]  effective and the globalists are beginning to lose their
[3:43:44.600 --> 3:43:47.800]  war against humanity in a big way. And so we're going to
[3:43:47.800 --> 3:43:50.760]  see some major fireworks out of them, but it's critical to
[3:43:50.760 --> 3:43:54.360]  not let ourselves get down when we see all the poison
[3:43:54.360 --> 3:43:57.400]  they spray at us. That's an attempt to demoralize us.
[3:43:57.400 --> 3:44:02.120]  We've got to remember that and stay focused and stay happy.
[3:44:02.120 --> 3:44:05.400]  China was already running the United States. You're like,
[3:44:05.400 --> 3:44:08.040]  well, China could never take over the US. That's right.
[3:44:08.040 --> 3:44:12.120]  As the Roman historian and Senator Cicero warned,
[3:44:12.120 --> 3:44:15.880]  a powerful empire can't fall from without before it first
[3:44:15.880 --> 3:44:20.680]  falls from within. So yes, they're coming for your guns,
[3:44:20.680 --> 3:44:23.480]  all of them. Yes, they're coming for your children.
[3:44:23.480 --> 3:44:26.440]  They've already taken your speech almost everywhere except
[3:44:26.440 --> 3:44:31.000]  pockets of resistance like infowars.com and band.video.
[3:44:31.000 --> 3:44:34.040]  So now you know why I'm so upset. Now you know why I'm so
[3:44:34.040 --> 3:44:37.800]  angry. I saw the producers of South Park on TV.
[3:44:37.800 --> 3:44:40.120]  They're totally pissing angry. People are like, why are they
[3:44:40.120 --> 3:44:43.320]  angry? Because they see all of their freedom, their American
[3:44:43.320 --> 3:44:47.400]  freedom, hard fought, taken away. Are you going to get upset?
[3:44:47.400 --> 3:44:49.720]  Well, you're a listener. You're obviously already upset.
[3:44:49.720 --> 3:44:52.680]  But you've got to ring the alarm everywhere until others, they've
[3:44:52.680 --> 3:44:55.800]  got to get upset and then take action and let Congress,
[3:44:55.800 --> 3:44:58.280]  everybody else know that we're not backing down and we're not
[3:44:58.280 --> 3:45:01.720]  going to sell America out to the Chikongs.
[3:45:02.920 --> 3:45:06.440]  I knew it would be hard to top the last big sale we had Black
[3:45:06.440 --> 3:45:11.080]  Friday comes early, but we've successfully been able to do it.
[3:45:11.080 --> 3:45:14.440]  Black Friday comes early was store-wide free shipping, double

[3:45:17.400 --> 3:45:20.520]  supplements and preparedness supplies, water filters,
[3:45:20.520 --> 3:45:23.960]  air filters, things like that. Well, the new special we've got
[3:45:23.960 --> 3:45:29.160]  is store-wide free shipping, double patriot points, and 40 to
[3:45:29.160 --> 3:45:33.800]  70% off all of the supplements and a whole bunch of other
[3:45:33.800 --> 3:45:37.320]  items. And a lot of these are our best sellers. Others are
[3:45:37.320 --> 3:45:40.200]  sleepers and products that I've just been so busy I haven't
[3:45:40.200 --> 3:45:44.120]  promoted, but they really are amazing. Find out for yourself.

[3:45:57.480 --> 3:46:00.520]  than 50 big deals right now. The everything must go
[3:46:00.520 --> 3:46:04.840]  super sale at m4store.com. Now is the critical time to keep
[3:46:04.840 --> 3:46:08.280]  him full wars on the air. Everything we've warned of is now
[3:46:08.280 --> 3:46:11.560]  being exposed and is out in the open. I want to be clear.
[3:46:11.560 --> 3:46:15.880]  It's not coming true. It was already true. I didn't predict
[3:46:15.880 --> 3:46:19.080]  all this. It was already going on. Now the globalists are
[3:46:19.080 --> 3:46:22.360]  making their move with the Chai Khoms, so it's naked. It's
[3:46:22.360 --> 3:46:26.200]  brazen. This is the point when the enemy emerges. It's like
[3:46:26.200 --> 3:46:29.320]  before World War II, the polls kept warning that Nazi Germany
[3:46:29.320 --> 3:46:32.200]  was going to attack them. Nobody believed them as they saw
[3:46:32.200 --> 3:46:35.560]  the troops massing until it finally happened. We're at
[3:46:35.560 --> 3:46:39.000]  that same point and we're all Paul Revere's who need to be
[3:46:39.000 --> 3:46:41.880]  out there warning everyone about what's unfolding because
[3:46:41.880 --> 3:46:45.160]  this is the critical fight and thank God America and the
[3:46:45.160 --> 3:46:50.120]  world is waking up at the 11th hour 58 minute. But will it be
[3:46:50.120 --> 3:46:53.480]  too little too late? That's up to you. This battle's hot.
[3:46:53.480 --> 3:46:56.760]  It's real. So spread the word and support M4 Wars today at
[3:46:56.760 --> 3:47:00.520]  M4Store.com. But whatever you do, spread the word about the
[3:47:00.520 --> 3:47:03.320]  live transmission.
[3:47:05.400 --> 3:47:10.040]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:47:10.040 --> 3:47:27.480]  We are back live. It's the final second of the fourth hour.
[3:47:27.480 --> 3:47:30.280]  Owen Schreuer is coming up with the war room and he is jammed
[3:47:30.280 --> 3:47:37.400]  back. Okay. Bill Barr gave a 45 minute speech at a
[3:47:37.400 --> 3:47:41.800]  university. He got almost no coverage. He said some powerful
[3:47:41.800 --> 3:47:45.080]  things that got linked up on M4 Wars.com. But then I went and
[3:47:45.080 --> 3:47:51.320]  I watched the full interview and it is extremely important.
[3:47:51.320 --> 3:47:55.880]  And so or the whole speech, I'm going to talk about it for a
[3:47:55.880 --> 3:47:59.320]  few minutes, play a few clips and then take some calls here.
[3:47:59.320 --> 3:48:03.320]  But tomorrow I'm going to air at least 20 minutes of the
[3:48:03.320 --> 3:48:06.600]  speech and I would suggest war room and firepower other
[3:48:06.600 --> 3:48:09.160]  shows here. Because it's powerful. Barr comes out and
[3:48:09.160 --> 3:48:11.720]  talks about how they're taking over the kids to destroy
[3:48:11.720 --> 3:48:15.640]  things on purpose. How it's not an accident, but it's plan
[3:48:15.640 --> 3:48:19.080]  destruction. That's the clips that are already out. We've
[3:48:19.080 --> 3:48:23.640]  already played. They're up on M4 Wars.com. This is not decay.
[3:48:23.640 --> 3:48:26.760]  This is organized destruction. The clips that nobody's seen.
[3:48:26.760 --> 3:48:31.240]  I mean, the speech is up, but it has no views are these.
[3:48:31.240 --> 3:48:34.840]  Because the little clips have millions of views. But all these
[3:48:34.840 --> 3:48:38.440]  other clips are just as powerful. AG Barr
[3:48:38.440 --> 3:48:42.120]  flames unremitting assault on religion, traditional values
[3:48:42.120 --> 3:48:45.640]  during Notre Dame visit. This is organized destruction, he
[3:48:45.640 --> 3:48:49.400]  says. Exactly. It's premeditated evil. But here's
[3:48:49.400 --> 3:48:55.160]  some of these clips. Here's Barr forcing LGBT in schools, the
[3:48:55.160 --> 3:48:59.400]  new curriculum being forced in schools. Here it is.
[3:48:59.400 --> 3:49:02.920]  Because this administration firmly supports accommodation of
[3:49:02.920 --> 3:49:06.760]  religion, the battleground at this time has largely shifted to
[3:49:06.760 --> 3:49:10.280]  the states. Some state governments are now attempting
[3:49:10.280 --> 3:49:13.720]  to compel religious individuals and entities to
[3:49:13.720 --> 3:49:17.480]  subscribe to practices or to espouse viewpoints that are
[3:49:17.480 --> 3:49:21.480]  incompatible with their religion. Ground zero for these
[3:49:21.480 --> 3:49:25.640]  attacks on religion are the schools. And to me, this is
[3:49:25.640 --> 3:49:30.040]  the most serious challenge to religious liberty today. For
[3:49:30.040 --> 3:49:33.240]  anyone who has a religious faith by far the most important
[3:49:33.240 --> 3:49:39.320]  part of exercising that faith is teaching that religion to
[3:49:39.320 --> 3:49:43.320]  your children. The passing on of the faith. There is no
[3:49:43.320 --> 3:49:46.440]  greater gift we can give our children and no greater
[3:49:46.440 --> 3:49:50.920]  expression of love. And for the government to interfere in
[3:49:50.920 --> 3:49:54.520]  that process is a monstrous invasion of religious
[3:49:54.520 --> 3:49:59.960]  liberty. Yet this is where the battle is being joined. And
[3:49:59.960 --> 3:50:04.680]  I see that is being waged on three fronts. The first
[3:50:04.680 --> 3:50:08.920]  front relates to the content of public school curriculum.
[3:50:08.920 --> 3:50:12.600]  Many states are adopting curriculum that is incompatible
[3:50:12.600 --> 3:50:16.920]  with traditional Judeo-Christian principles according to
[3:50:16.920 --> 3:50:20.520]  which parents are attempting to raise their children. And
[3:50:20.520 --> 3:50:25.240]  they often do this without any opt-out provision for
[3:50:25.240 --> 3:50:29.400]  religious families. Thus, for example, New Jersey recently
[3:50:29.400 --> 3:50:33.080]  passed a law requiring public schools to adopt an LGBT
[3:50:33.080 --> 3:50:36.600]  curriculum that many feel is inconsistent with
[3:50:36.600 --> 3:50:40.360]  traditional Christian teaching. Similar laws have been
[3:50:40.360 --> 3:50:44.520]  passed in California and Illinois. And the Orange
[3:50:44.520 --> 3:50:47.240]  County Board of Education in California issued an
[3:50:47.240 --> 3:50:50.840]  opinion that, quote, parents who disagree with the
[3:50:50.840 --> 3:50:55.880]  instructional material related to gender, gender identity,
[3:50:55.880 --> 3:50:59.560]  gender expression, and sexual orientation may not excuse
[3:50:59.560 --> 3:51:04.200]  their children from this instruction. Indeed, in some
[3:51:04.200 --> 3:51:07.160]  cases, the schools may not even warn parents about the
[3:51:07.160 --> 3:51:10.600]  lessons they plan to teach on controversial subjects
[3:51:10.600 --> 3:51:15.000]  relating to sexual behavior and relationships. This puts
[3:51:15.000 --> 3:51:18.680]  parents who dissent from the secular orthodoxy to a
[3:51:18.680 --> 3:51:22.840]  difficult choice. Try to scrape together enough money to
[3:51:22.840 --> 3:51:26.600]  send their kids to private school or homeschooling or
[3:51:26.600 --> 3:51:30.200]  allow their children to be inculcated with messages that
[3:51:30.200 --> 3:51:34.520]  they fundamentally reject. Now, I can't give all this
[3:51:34.520 --> 3:51:36.520]  justice. Someone's going to take some calls. You've been
[3:51:36.520 --> 3:51:41.240]  holding at the end. There's literally like, I don't know,
[3:51:41.240 --> 3:51:44.680]  14 clips on one page and six on another. And they're all
[3:51:44.680 --> 3:51:50.040]  powerful. And again, it's secular orthodoxy, but it's
[3:51:50.040 --> 3:51:54.200]  not secular. It's a cultic. And it's little kids, fifth
[3:51:54.200 --> 3:51:56.920]  graders, first graders, third graders, literally being
[3:51:56.920 --> 3:52:00.600]  taught about other imaginary genders about sex between the
[3:52:00.600 --> 3:52:04.040]  same sexes or sex period. That's pervert behavior. That's
[3:52:04.040 --> 3:52:06.040]  Jocelyn Elders saying, teacher, five-year-old out of
[3:52:06.040 --> 3:52:11.000]  masturbate, reach down and help them. These are sickos. This
[3:52:11.000 --> 3:52:15.560]  is nameless takeover. And he gets into all that and he says
[3:52:15.560 --> 3:52:18.920]  that government enables societal decay, how government
[3:52:18.920 --> 3:52:23.080]  programs enable decay. I promise you, I will air this
[3:52:23.080 --> 3:52:24.680]  tomorrow. I got to most things today. It's been an
[3:52:24.680 --> 3:52:27.320]  incredible show. Incredible broadcast. I mean, the good,
[3:52:27.320 --> 3:52:31.400]  the bad, the ugly. War rooms coming up. Owen did a bunch
[3:52:31.400 --> 3:52:33.800]  of amazing stuff. In fact, here's his part of it. He went
[3:52:33.800 --> 3:52:38.040]  down to a pelicans and spurs game to bring up the attack on
[3:52:38.040 --> 3:52:40.680]  free speech. And here's part of what happened. There'll be
[3:52:40.680 --> 3:52:43.080]  more on his show. He went out and talked to the crowd after.
[3:52:43.080 --> 3:52:50.280]  Here it is. China owns the NBA. He did that right up at the
[3:52:50.280 --> 3:52:54.120]  beginning of the exhibition game. And this is what happened
[3:52:54.120 --> 3:52:58.600]  to free speech. We're encouraging others to do this.
[3:52:58.600 --> 3:53:01.400]  Because if you don't exercise it, you're going to lose it.
[3:53:01.400 --> 3:53:03.800]  Remember, these are the same folks, the NBA boycotting
[3:53:03.800 --> 3:53:06.920]  Israel. That's their right to do that. But then the old
[3:53:06.920 --> 3:53:18.280]  communist China, they love them. And then they come to take
[3:53:18.280 --> 3:53:23.560]  it away and throw it out. I mean, this is so unamerican
[3:53:23.560 --> 3:53:27.320]  what these institutions have become who they are, what
[3:53:27.320 --> 3:53:29.960]  they are. And they're working at every level to take our
[3:53:29.960 --> 3:53:32.520]  bank accounts away to boycott us to shut us down. So we
[3:53:32.520 --> 3:53:35.240]  didn't have the show. And then they want to comply with
[3:53:35.240 --> 3:53:41.320]  what communist China has to say. China owns the NBA.
[3:53:41.320 --> 3:53:43.080]  You see, oh, it's their private building. It's their own
[3:53:43.080 --> 3:53:47.400]  private thing. China killed more than Hitler.
[3:53:47.400 --> 3:53:52.520]  They even take CNN reporters' signs away now.
[3:53:54.920 --> 3:53:58.120]  They take CNN's mics away when they ask. What is your view on
[3:53:58.120 --> 3:54:02.360]  freedom of expression? Can't even talk about freedom of
[3:54:02.360 --> 3:54:05.480]  expression. And then Owen goes outside and talks to folks
[3:54:05.480 --> 3:54:08.280]  he did get it on TV. But that's what's effective. That's
[3:54:08.280 --> 3:54:10.840]  what everybody should be doing. And if you won't do it,
[3:54:10.840 --> 3:54:14.040]  we're going to lose everything. You absolutely have to get
[3:54:14.040 --> 3:54:16.840]  involved. You know, I got Zach, I got Johnny, I got Peter,
[3:54:16.840 --> 3:54:18.920]  I got John, I got Chris. I want to try to get to everybody.
[3:54:18.920 --> 3:54:21.160]  Let's go to Zach in Austin. Zach, thanks for holding.
[3:54:21.160 --> 3:54:27.080]  What's your view on all this? Oh, yeah. Hey, CNN is
[3:54:27.080 --> 3:54:33.160]  definitely a witch hunt against Trump. And I think, similarly,
[3:54:33.160 --> 3:54:39.400]  in fours is the same way when you guys try to suppress freedom
[3:54:39.400 --> 3:54:45.160]  of speech, when you don't allow somebody who wants to talk
[3:54:45.160 --> 3:54:49.400]  about pre-trip like Bible dance. Hey, I appreciate your call,
[3:54:49.400 --> 3:54:52.280]  sir. We don't censor you. When we're talking about subjects
[3:54:52.280 --> 3:54:54.920]  like that, you can call in, you call it in line under all
[3:54:54.920 --> 3:54:57.640]  these names to say that I'm going to hell or something
[3:54:57.640 --> 3:55:01.240]  because I don't believe in a pre-trip. Okay, I believe in a
[3:55:01.240 --> 3:55:04.920]  pre-trip then. Dan, leave me alone. Whatever. Just let's go
[3:55:04.920 --> 3:55:07.880]  out and preach the gospel, okay? Just stop lying. That's not
[3:55:07.880 --> 3:55:11.000]  very Christian. That's not Zach in Austin. He held for two
[3:55:11.000 --> 3:55:14.840]  hours to say that. Johnny in Ontario, Canada, go ahead.
[3:55:14.840 --> 3:55:17.640]  You're on the air. Thanks for holding. Hey, you're welcome,
[3:55:17.640 --> 3:55:23.080]  man. Yeah, I'm really concerned about what's coming up
[3:55:23.080 --> 3:55:29.240]  right now. I think, I think Mr. Donald has waited too long.
[3:55:29.240 --> 3:55:32.360]  I think he should have administered this lockdown
[3:55:32.360 --> 3:55:37.160]  like about maybe a couple weeks ago. And no, I agree.
[3:55:37.160 --> 3:55:39.880]  Trump and the Justice Department are just sitting on their hands
[3:55:39.880 --> 3:55:43.400]  while the Justice Department indicts people close to Trump for no reason
[3:55:43.400 --> 3:55:46.840]  and moves towards Giuliani. It's just, it's signaling weakness
[3:55:46.840 --> 3:55:50.440]  and, you know, Trump's speeches are great, but his action is not great
[3:55:50.440 --> 3:55:53.720]  and he's signaling weakness of the deep state. We need action now,
[3:55:53.720 --> 3:55:58.520]  Johnny. Yeah, you got to attack. And I think Donald's
[3:55:58.520 --> 3:56:01.720]  trying too much for a nice guy. I hear you. I don't mean to cut you
[3:56:01.720 --> 3:56:04.040]  off when I get everybody in. Peter in Michigan. Peter, thanks
[3:56:04.040 --> 3:56:06.920]  for holding. You're on the air worldwide. Go ahead.
[3:56:06.920 --> 3:56:10.680]  Yes, sir. I appreciate your time. Long time listener. First time
[3:56:10.680 --> 3:56:16.520]  caller. Love your supplements, brother. Thank you for keeping up the fight.
[3:56:16.520 --> 3:56:21.560]  I'm just more worried about when I say worried, I guess anxious is
[3:56:21.560 --> 3:56:26.600]  probably the better word for it. Trump is needing to go
[3:56:26.600 --> 3:56:31.000]  hands down like he never has before. Oh, everyone's saying the same thing.
[3:56:31.000 --> 3:56:34.200]  We're anxious. The tyranny's out in the open. These people are lying.
[3:56:34.200 --> 3:56:37.000]  They're committing crimes. They're trying to start race wars.
[3:56:37.000 --> 3:56:39.880]  And then they're saying we're the violent ones. They're getting ready for false
[3:56:39.880 --> 3:56:44.200]  flags. Yes, sir. I totally believe that.
[3:56:44.200 --> 3:56:48.040]  The church, the Christian church has to get away.
[3:56:48.040 --> 3:56:51.640]  Where is the church when now the Democrats say take their tax exemption?
[3:56:51.640 --> 3:56:55.480]  You can't do that, but the church has been over so much and is no longer the
[3:56:55.480 --> 3:56:58.120]  church. And so, of course, the church is saying
[3:56:58.120 --> 3:57:00.680]  nothing because, oh, we better not say anything. Look, they're already coming
[3:57:00.680 --> 3:57:03.640]  after you because the church says nothing, because they're no longer
[3:57:03.640 --> 3:57:07.080]  churches. They're whorehouses, most of them. Peter, thank you.
[3:57:07.080 --> 3:57:09.960]  I'm sorry to John. I'm sorry to Chris. We're out of time, but I got to a lot of
[3:57:09.960 --> 3:57:12.920]  calls today. Thank you for calling. Call me back tomorrow.
[3:57:12.920 --> 3:57:16.920]  And I will go to your calls or the War Room with Owen Shruller or Firepower
[3:57:16.920 --> 3:57:19.800]  with Will Johnson and Tom Papert or The David Knight Show.
[3:57:19.800 --> 3:57:23.160]  Weekday mornings, 8 a.m. Central, infowars.com,
[3:57:23.160 --> 3:57:26.520]  forward slash show, band.video. So much happening, so much
[3:57:26.520 --> 3:57:28.760]  breaking in info wars. I can't even cover it all.
[3:57:28.760 --> 3:57:32.200]  I mean, and share those articles, folks. People are ready to be awakened.
[3:57:32.200 --> 3:57:35.480]  They're banning and censoring everybody because the truth is effective
[3:57:35.480 --> 3:57:40.040]  and it's viral, but you've got to spread it. Thank you all for your support. God
[3:57:40.040 --> 3:57:43.160]  bless you. Great job of the crew. Powerful four hours.
[3:57:43.160 --> 3:57:46.120]  We just knocked it out of the park. We wouldn't even be here if it wasn't for
[3:57:46.120 --> 3:57:50.680]  you, Lester. So I'm very thankful and I salute you all and I salute Project
[3:57:50.680 --> 3:58:11.320]  Veritas.
