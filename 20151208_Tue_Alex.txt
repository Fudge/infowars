[00:00.000 --> 00:14.160]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones
[00:14.160 --> 00:23.800]  on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones that's right my friends it is
[00:23.800 --> 00:34.600]  Tuesday the 8th day of December 2015 I'm your host Alex Jones and we are going to be live here as
[00:34.600 --> 00:41.160]  we are weekdays 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. for four hours today and of course the nightly news will be 7
[00:41.160 --> 00:50.040]  o'clock central standard time this evening Donald Trump has come out and quotes demanded total and
[00:50.040 --> 00:56.520]  complete shutdown of Muslims entering America we're going to play a clip of the speech that he
[00:56.520 --> 01:02.360]  gave yesterday this has Republicans and others lining up calling him a bigot a racist and all
[01:02.360 --> 01:09.360]  the rest of it despite the fact that being Muslim is not a race I'm going to give you my take on
[01:09.360 --> 01:17.240]  this after we play a clip from the speech I watched last night and I watched the president truly
[01:17.240 --> 01:28.800]  that didn't know what he was doing he didn't he didn't know why he was there he refuses to use the
[01:28.800 --> 01:36.360]  term radical Islamic terrorism he refuses to use the term I don't even know if he knows what the
[01:36.360 --> 01:42.440]  hell is going on I really don't Donald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of
[01:42.440 --> 01:51.120]  Muslims entering the United States until our country's representatives can figure out what
[01:51.120 --> 01:58.880]  the hell is going on we're going to be covering more of this obviously throughout the day but
[01:58.880 --> 02:06.640]  here's the final equation is Trump putting this the best way he could probably not but he knows
[02:06.640 --> 02:12.240]  he's talking to a general American population that has been let's just say it dumbed down to a
[02:12.240 --> 02:19.560]  certain extent so he's just putting it out there as meat and potatoes here's the issue there should
[02:19.560 --> 02:27.360]  be a total ban on any refugees out of Syria because most of them are invaders who came in the last
[02:27.360 --> 02:34.680]  five years to take the nation over and the FBI has admitted that they're not being vetted at all
[02:34.680 --> 02:41.160]  and that upwards of 80% have fake passports and are military aged men there are countless videos
[02:41.160 --> 02:48.720]  on YouTube millions of views a piece of at the tunnel between France and England the UK thousands
[02:48.720 --> 02:54.680]  of illegals just running around beating people throwing rocks attacking the truck drivers for
[02:54.680 --> 03:00.400]  no reason and the police won't protect them and how many Facebook images do we have where it shows
[03:00.400 --> 03:09.120]  Al Qaeda ISIS fighters in Syria and then it cuts to them in Germany or France or Poland or Hungary
[03:09.120 --> 03:15.480]  or Sweden or Belgium or the Netherlands they're proud of it and I can tell you soldiers when I
[03:15.480 --> 03:25.760]  see them a good percentage I'm talking 20 30% are combat vets of the Saudi run invasion I know
[03:25.760 --> 03:35.080]  soldiers when I'm looking at them plus it's admitted so as this unfolds every time the media
[03:35.080 --> 03:39.880]  finds the image of a woman or a child they zoom in on it because from the videos I've seen what's
[03:39.880 --> 03:50.200]  more like 98% are men but the governments are saying 80% but you can watch hours of footage of
[03:50.200 --> 03:54.520]  the trucks being attacked the trucks being robbed the car jackies people attacking the mirrors
[03:54.520 --> 04:00.000]  throwing rocks cussing I mean I couldn't help myself even there are 20 people I just get out
[04:00.000 --> 04:04.920]  with a baseball bat of course in America you know what happened it'd be oh you climb up on
[04:04.920 --> 04:10.560]  the truck we're attacking boom nobody else would do that you want to assault my vehicle with it
[04:10.560 --> 04:16.360]  with a with a tire arm right in the center of your chest see how that feels having your heart
[04:16.360 --> 04:23.720]  blown out your back I'm not gonna roll over to this crap so yes it is an invasion orchestrated
[04:23.720 --> 04:30.360]  by criminals in our western governments yes you must stop all from war-torn areas because it's a
[04:30.360 --> 04:40.040]  military infiltration zone that's what he should have said not ban all Muslims period I mean what
[04:40.040 --> 04:45.520]  do you got Muslims flying in from Israel or flying in from you know flying in from Jordan or
[04:45.520 --> 04:50.720]  something you know own houses or businesses here you can't do that but anyone not vetted properly
[04:50.720 --> 04:55.800]  from a war-torn torn zone you're banned and everybody in the government that's been allowing
[04:55.800 --> 05:01.240]  them in under Obama's orders are culpable the Huffington Post is calling for the government to
[05:01.240 --> 05:07.160]  seize all firearms saying that micro and many efforts to destroy the Second Amendment are not
[05:07.160 --> 05:12.920]  working the post reads given that even micro gun control measures will be effectively blocked by
[05:12.920 --> 05:18.640]  the NRA and its allies and that promoting many measures will be potentially effective is misleading
[05:18.640 --> 05:24.320]  progressives may as well go for the big enchilada call for domestic disarmament right to George
[05:24.320 --> 05:30.040]  Washington University professor of international relations the professor would also have Congress
[05:30.040 --> 05:35.920]  past legislation making gun manufacturers liable for the harm done with their products and outlaw
[05:35.920 --> 05:40.800]  the sale of ammunition if the current political climate is any indication this will not happen
[05:40.800 --> 05:45.840]  the professor does not detail how more than 300 million firearms in the United States would be
[05:45.840 --> 05:50.840]  confiscated he also does not address the fact that forced disarmament will lead to the death

[08:10.520 --> 08:16.360]  it's alex jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war
[08:18.600 --> 08:23.880]  well i'm going to say it here clear for everyone because i actually agree with what donald trump
[08:23.880 --> 08:32.840]  said we do need to have a total and complete shutdown of everyone coming from a long list
[08:33.560 --> 08:40.840]  of nations who have not been properly vetted and the federal government will allow people in with
[08:40.840 --> 08:47.880]  fake passports fake names fake addresses like the saudi arabian jihad princess who was clearly
[08:47.880 --> 08:52.760]  involved in the attacks in san bernadino last week leading her husband and the killing of 14 people
[08:52.760 --> 08:57.800]  they want to use this to take our second amendment that's been announced by the supreme court by the
[08:57.800 --> 09:04.040]  way devastatingly bad news coming up they are coming after our freedom they are trying to put
[09:04.040 --> 09:11.960]  citizens in no fly list no gun by list extra judicially while bringing in hundreds of thousands
[09:13.240 --> 09:19.320]  of quote migrants and not telling governors where they're being deposited telling governors they
[09:19.320 --> 09:24.360]  don't care of the refugee act states that governors have to be appraised and have to agree to it
[09:24.360 --> 09:29.320]  that's being violated so many laws are being violated right now they're just letting these
[09:29.320 --> 09:37.480]  people in planes are landing on record at jfk with 144 people on board with no id's two weeks ago
[09:37.480 --> 09:44.280]  and they just let them in this has reached crazy town proportions that's what's radical
[09:44.280 --> 09:55.320]  that's what's bad if somebody puts cyanide in the local water district tanks and you don't
[09:55.320 --> 10:01.240]  know exactly where that cyanide was sent or how many people it will affect you shut off the water
[10:01.240 --> 10:07.000]  system you don't just tell folks to boil the water you shut it off and if you've got 80
[10:07.000 --> 10:12.840]  percent or more being military aged men with fake passports and our government knows it's fake
[10:12.840 --> 10:18.280]  and the EU government knows it's fake and is letting them into attack so our governments can
[10:18.280 --> 10:27.000]  take the guns and declare civil emergencies emergency powers that's that's a fancy name for
[10:27.000 --> 10:39.720]  martial law if that's being done you shut it off now the litmus test he would say is are you a
[10:39.720 --> 10:46.520]  muslim well radical islamists are on record and the karan states that if you are in the land of the
[10:46.520 --> 10:54.600]  profane of the enemy of the heathen of the unwashed then you can say you're not a muslim so that
[10:54.600 --> 11:03.640]  listen the test is not the way to go the litmus test is congress moves the states move lawsuits
[11:03.640 --> 11:10.680]  indictments impeachment not just against the president but the ice and the different agencies
[11:10.680 --> 11:16.360]  following the orders the customs department the heads of it who are all a bunch of former
[11:16.360 --> 11:21.880]  ford foundation people that want open borders that are globalists on record they all need to be
[11:21.880 --> 11:27.480]  impeached right now the government has the borders open without vetting people and is
[11:27.480 --> 11:33.640]  bringing them in they've turned off the vetting by design they will not tell the governors where
[11:33.640 --> 11:41.160]  the people are being taken well i know where 300 from syria and iraq almost all of them soony to
[11:41.160 --> 11:49.080]  anderson high school where i went to high school for two years in 1991 and 1992 20 plus years ago
[11:49.080 --> 12:01.240]  where i went to high school 25 years ago they have 300 refugees in the last month 600 in austin
[12:01.240 --> 12:06.600]  alone and that's the numbers they're giving us we keep discovering the numbers are 3 4 5 even 10
[12:06.600 --> 12:12.200]  times higher they follow an algorithm they've used in europe they call it 10 000 it's 100 000 they
[12:12.200 --> 12:17.880]  call it 100 000 it's a million they call it a million it's 4 million and jacari jackson has
[12:17.880 --> 12:22.760]  reported on this extensively migrants flood austin texas schools is the headline if you want to see
[12:22.760 --> 12:31.960]  the video this is a big deal and in an inverted reality trump comes out and says what most people
[12:31.960 --> 12:37.480]  are thinking including Shiite muslims and others that are being exterminated all over the world by
[12:37.480 --> 12:47.720]  radical soonies you think they let soonies into iraq you think they'd let them into syria i mean
[12:47.720 --> 12:53.720]  syria was majority soony but they were the non radical type who were being killed by again the
[12:53.720 --> 12:59.720]  islamo fascists and that's what they are that's a good term for them out of saudi arabia that is
[12:59.720 --> 13:06.040]  conquering right now and obama and the e u criminals want to bring in a checkmate level group
[13:06.760 --> 13:13.880]  who can destabilize and attack every major town and every major city with commando style sleeper
[13:13.880 --> 13:20.440]  cell rage any time they want this is one of the major globals takedown operations and as i told you
[13:20.440 --> 13:27.080]  four years ago with the gazi three and a half plus years ago as i told you every show since then
[13:27.080 --> 13:32.760]  they will start shooting down airliners with stinger missiles with impads they will start
[13:33.400 --> 13:38.600]  taking down other aircraft with any tank weapons that will also be very useful against helicopters
[13:38.600 --> 13:45.560]  they will start attacking they will start bombing planes and it's begun and the major clerics of
[13:45.560 --> 13:52.680]  saudi arabia in the last month and a half have called for asymmetrical attacks with knives guns
[13:52.680 --> 14:01.000]  or improvised explosive devices against western and christian targets and they think we're so dumb
[14:01.000 --> 14:08.680]  they'll use to take our guns and our freedoms and blame everyone in general because we're fair
[14:08.680 --> 14:12.600]  we don't discriminate everyone loses their rights here in this authoritarian system
[14:14.120 --> 14:21.000]  no anyone associated with radical jihad wahhabist groups should obviously now go under surveillance
[14:22.040 --> 14:27.240]  because you've been brought in you're part of a group sworn to do this it is your religion to
[14:27.240 --> 14:34.440]  conquer islam itself and then the world they say that we will take control of islam we are islam
[14:34.440 --> 14:41.160]  they are the radicals they are the firebrands they are the shock troops they are the the the uh the
[14:41.160 --> 14:48.440]  cancer that has been allowed in so that the command and control system gets more no bid contracts
[14:48.440 --> 14:51.960]  and gets to invade more countries that aren't even the countries that are attacking us you
[14:51.960 --> 14:55.960]  notice they're on the news saying take out a side it's his fault this is happening when our own
[14:55.960 --> 15:06.280]  government nato ran this whole operation against syria criminally so donald trump is correct when
[15:06.280 --> 15:13.560]  he says we've got to cut it off total and complete the brash way he put it will be good red meat for
[15:13.560 --> 15:19.480]  the grass roots out there that's sick of rolling over but it'll be spine as unamerican and as unfair
[15:19.480 --> 15:24.920]  well if they're not doing vetting of the people then you do have to shut it all off not because
[15:24.920 --> 15:31.480]  they're muslim but because we don't know who's radical or a sleeper cell and so the bigger issue
[15:31.480 --> 15:36.440]  is until the government vets people properly which the fbi admits they're not allowed to do
[15:36.440 --> 15:42.040]  they admit that's not happening before congress a month ago and last week we played the hearings
[15:43.320 --> 15:49.880]  so trump needs to add the caveat and say the media needs to follow my full statement we're not
[15:49.880 --> 15:58.440]  vetting these people they're being brought in in mass now we need to completely shut it off until
[15:58.440 --> 16:04.840]  it's fixed and until people can be investigated that's very simple and that's the federal law
[16:05.400 --> 16:08.200]  and i know trump came out a number a few months ago and said we should let them
[16:08.920 --> 16:13.480]  refugees in because he's talking about christians it's the right thing to do they're being killed
[16:14.120 --> 16:17.640]  and i criticized him and others did and he backed off that real fast and i'm gonna
[16:17.640 --> 16:25.000]  reach out today because he's got some advisors there that are okay people like stone really know
[16:25.000 --> 16:30.520]  what they're doing and you know he needs to be obviously tweak this a little bit but they're
[16:30.520 --> 16:34.760]  going to really try to use it against him he can't apologize for him now now that it's out there he's
[16:34.760 --> 16:40.200]  got to double down obviously that's what people like trump but let's go over the evidence here
[16:40.200 --> 16:46.280]  until they vet these people and don't criminally let folks in with fake names and fake passports
[16:46.280 --> 16:52.120]  and fake addresses we need to block everyone coming in from these countries
[16:56.520 --> 17:00.440]  and now the reporting CNN selectively edits donald trump's muslim registry
[17:00.440 --> 17:06.040]  comments to make him look like an anti muslim bigot it's being reported and they've already done that
[17:07.080 --> 17:12.280]  so the point is he just needs to continue to expose how they spin everything let's continue
[17:12.280 --> 17:20.920]  you one christian out of 236 syrian refugees admitted since paris attacks to the united states
[17:20.920 --> 17:25.480]  one christian see they won't let the christians in because that's the targeted group by the little
[17:25.480 --> 17:31.560]  sunnis by the wahhabist so these are the little darlings that went on jihad pilgrimage to go
[17:31.560 --> 17:36.920]  murder some innocent muslims and christians many of them and take their property and now they failed
[17:36.920 --> 17:44.120]  so they're allowed to enter into europe and then the united states and then obama won't vet him
[17:44.120 --> 17:49.400]  because he knows it's all completely fake truly sickening and then we get to pay for all their
[17:49.400 --> 18:02.040]  kids over 35 000 issued same fiance visa as sam bernadino shooter see how that works he's darling
[18:02.040 --> 18:08.440]  little little death mistress oh i'm sorry i showed her in her headdress that's that's demonizing
[18:08.440 --> 18:12.840]  muslims well that's what radical muslims have their women or orthodox muslims have their women
[18:12.840 --> 18:18.920]  wear i mean this is msnbc says it's bad to show it yes because you said so melissa harris perry and
[18:18.920 --> 18:23.160]  i better do what you say i better put my tail between my legs and roll over on the ground
[18:23.160 --> 18:29.160]  like a little puppy when you say so and then urinate on myself because you're my master you
[18:29.160 --> 18:38.440]  said so oh my gosh oh boy i better do what you say muslim migrants beat rapes north dakota woman
[18:38.440 --> 18:42.200]  while chanting a la akbar the police say they have surveillance footage of all of it

[18:56.120 --> 19:01.400]  and it's being defended by the family i mean after all you got the emom of jerusalem and all
[19:01.400 --> 19:06.280]  these other muslim leaders saying they are weak the americans the europeans take them take their
[19:06.280 --> 19:15.960]  women take them no no you can't even make up that stereotype we are coming weak europeans
[19:15.960 --> 19:21.240]  for your women we will have them they will soon wear the hijab and we'll do as we say
[19:21.240 --> 19:29.400]  hey and then i mean he's like how dare donald trump say block the muslims
[19:29.400 --> 19:34.200]  and that's a dumb down way to say it but the public gets that it shut it off till the vetting
[19:34.200 --> 19:42.200]  process happens unbelievable muslim migrants you mean another wahhabist that's turns out
[19:42.200 --> 19:46.280]  that soon this guy is from somalia yelling a la akbar because that's why he's allowed to

[26:07.400 --> 26:13.560]  elites of course are allied with them and they're involved in an attempted takeover of the world
[26:13.560 --> 26:20.200]  who's wahhabist samalia totally they kill you if you're not they're basically 99 percent
[26:21.080 --> 26:27.240]  who's attacking kenya the christian nation the wahhabist who's attacking all these other african
[26:27.240 --> 26:34.760]  countries as far south and west as nigeria okoharam they fly al-qaeda flags same group
[26:34.760 --> 26:42.520]  who attack libya al-qaeda who attack syria al-qaeda who attacked egypt al-qaeda al-qaeda al-qaeda al-qaeda
[26:42.520 --> 26:48.680]  al-qaeda al-qaeda al-qaeda al-qaeda which is known as al-nazra or isis or isis is their state
[26:48.680 --> 26:58.680]  and our government is bringing them in in mass but almost no christians or shiites in fact i've
[26:58.680 --> 27:02.920]  been reading these lists every week to come out the hundreds of thousands in europe the thousands
[27:02.920 --> 27:08.520]  here there's never shiites because they ask them are you suny are you shiite are you christian
[27:08.520 --> 27:13.240]  are you zoho aster are you i mean they got some other little subgroups there they're even older
[27:13.240 --> 27:19.320]  than islam or christianity zoho aster is uh actually your dog worshipers star worshipers
[27:19.320 --> 27:23.480]  dog star worshipers that's kind of prometheus stuff uh that's actually what the elites are
[27:23.480 --> 27:27.400]  actually until a lot of the top leader actually zoho aster is to switch in on some inside baseball
[27:27.400 --> 27:31.880]  in case you want to know you might want to know that uh but that's not a persia and northern india
[27:33.000 --> 27:38.520]  and there is just a scourge of wahhabists they are the majority group now in saudi arabia
[27:38.520 --> 27:42.280]  and they're just running around bullying and attacking everyone and they just think they're
[27:42.280 --> 27:48.360]  above the law and saudi arabia admits these are their invasion pilgrims these men 18 to 30 on
[27:48.360 --> 27:56.200]  average they're sending in the jihadi's broken one truck and there was a polar bear in the back
[27:56.200 --> 28:04.040]  people just say they didn't they didn't go after that this is from macho bull october 15 there are
[28:04.040 --> 28:11.160]  just hundreds of these videos online where they're robbing the trucks going into the tunnel and then
[28:11.160 --> 28:15.560]  donald trump comes in and says block all muslims coming in and he actually went on to say until
[28:15.560 --> 28:19.720]  there's a vetting process but they cut that out and he just needs to continue to come out in fact
[28:19.720 --> 28:25.800]  let's tweet i want to tweet right now donald trump is right about blocking all muslims coming into
[28:25.800 --> 28:33.240]  the united states until they are vetted donald trump is right about all muslims being barred
[28:33.240 --> 28:38.680]  from the united states from entering the united states don trump is right about barring all muslims
[28:38.680 --> 28:44.120]  from all new muslims see how do you say it perfectly because it's legalese they can twist it
[28:44.840 --> 28:51.880]  the point is donald trump is right about barring foreign muslims from the united states until
[28:51.880 --> 28:58.680]  they can be vetted i want to tweak that out donald trump is right about barring all foreign muslims
[28:58.680 --> 29:04.520]  from entering the united states until they can be vetted and then tweet next that's basically his
[29:04.520 --> 29:08.680]  full statement because now i've gone actually found the full statement and they're just taking it out
[29:08.680 --> 29:15.640]  of context of course they should be of course i mean if we brought in put the shoe on the other
[29:15.640 --> 29:21.720]  foot uh you know say a hundred thousand germans and say five percent of them were wanted for
[29:21.720 --> 29:27.160]  terrorism or whatever we'd say stop all germans coming in until we've got a vetting process
[29:27.160 --> 29:32.760]  and they have a vetting process they won't implement it because obama knows it's his defeated
[29:32.760 --> 29:40.280]  shoddy arabian qatari attack unit and if you care about muslims you got to care about not
[29:40.280 --> 29:44.920]  bringing in the most vicious group that demonizes them gives them a bad name and can't wait to
[29:44.920 --> 29:51.000]  kill them the first group they want to kill are sheites we're on the march the empires on the run

[35:49.480 --> 35:55.000]  such as semi-automatic rifles using recent mass shootings this is just devastating this is the
[35:55.000 --> 36:00.520]  blackmail against them and they're stacking it with all those weirdos like yellen and and and the

[37:53.800 --> 37:58.040]  the court's move is a small victory for activists no it's a devastating victory they don't want to

[38:01.480 --> 38:06.760]  you know is a major offensive this is like the 10 offensive folks the court's move is a small
[38:06.760 --> 38:11.000]  victory for activists again they always wanted to see their enemy the people so remember everything's
[38:11.000 --> 38:15.320]  the opposite the court's move is a devastating victory for enemies of freedom and their enslavement
[38:15.320 --> 38:19.560]  of humanity and their move to disarm us ahead of true political persecution oh i just translated
[38:19.560 --> 38:26.040]  sorry the court's move is a small victory for activists against the spread of such guns which
[38:26.040 --> 38:32.760]  can potentially kill many people in a short period of time by rejecting the case today the supreme
[38:32.760 --> 38:37.880]  court side with the community that has taken action to protect itself from type of violence
[38:37.880 --> 38:45.000]  we've seen in San Bernardino oh from the jihadis you brought in on college campuses in a movie theaters
[38:45.000 --> 38:50.360]  said dan gross president of the brady campaign senator prevent gun violence and it just goes on
[38:50.360 --> 38:56.280]  from there they want to admit though that the shooters had legally got purchased guns and so
[38:56.280 --> 39:02.360]  now they just must be banned let's move on to this other article by cart demo up on info wars.com
[39:02.360 --> 39:08.360]  huffington post calls for government to seize all firearms and they just go on and admit it in the
[39:08.360 --> 39:13.480]  article there's a bunch of these articles and go yes you're correct we always wanted your guns
[39:13.480 --> 39:17.720]  we're gonna get them but no you will not stop us and they want to start a civil war that's the plan
[39:20.440 --> 39:24.280]  they want to have the local police go out and persecute veterans until the veterans stand up
[39:24.280 --> 39:31.800]  wipe out the local police for the black lives matter movement and then move in the feds after that
[39:32.360 --> 39:35.720]  there's the headline needed domestic disarmament not gun control
[39:37.560 --> 39:43.160]  sorry it's not gonna happen scum and all of you promoting it and pushing it are being noted
[39:43.720 --> 39:49.880]  as collaborators those aren't just words that means something you are collaborators in the
[39:49.880 --> 39:56.040]  takeover of this country and all the persecution and evil that you've signed on to with this foreign
[39:56.040 --> 40:02.680]  takeover you've signed on to it cowards always commit once they've signed on to the bullies
[40:02.680 --> 40:10.600]  errand thinking they're gonna win and in the end they fail they fall and when you fall you fall
[40:10.600 --> 40:21.720]  forever i'm sorry you're just really gonna fall hard aren't you now continuing hubbing and post
[40:21.720 --> 40:28.360]  calls for government to seize all firearms here's the headline george washington university
[40:28.360 --> 40:34.760]  professor suffering from the liberal disease the irrational and paranoid fear of guns is calling
[40:34.760 --> 40:41.160]  for total disarmament in the united states given that even quote micro gun control measures will
[40:41.160 --> 40:45.960]  be effectively blocked with the mra and its allies in that promoting many measures is potentially
[40:45.960 --> 40:51.480]  effective as misleading progressives may as well go for the big enchilada call for domestic disarmament
[40:52.680 --> 40:59.080]  writes a montia as to nani a professor of international relations and it goes on from
[40:59.080 --> 41:05.720]  there well see we've always known that's your goal you've done it everywhere else and in all
[41:05.720 --> 41:12.200]  the cities you control that have the highest crime rates hey how about mexico highest crime rate in
[41:12.200 --> 41:16.840]  the world for a decade running over a hundred thousand people dead now that they found a lot
[41:16.840 --> 41:22.920]  more they haven't dug up yet where hundreds of university students a year sometimes 40 50 at a
[41:22.920 --> 41:29.480]  pop just disappear and are murdered and grabbed by the state who are the people that only have the guns
[41:33.640 --> 41:38.920]  oh because america ship guns down there no almost every gun used in serious crime is full auto
[41:38.920 --> 41:44.600]  that's what the state and the drug cartels use they don't use bolt action rifles and stuff bought
[41:44.600 --> 41:49.720]  in the u.s. and it's been proven that it's been the mexican citizens themselves that have turned
[41:49.720 --> 41:54.680]  the tide a bit and cut the crime rate and actually driven the cartels out of many areas
[41:54.680 --> 41:59.960]  because they were able to get guns out of the united states that's why they set up fast and furious
[41:59.960 --> 42:04.520]  to try to blame the second amendment to stop that so mexico couldn't defend itself from the globalist
[42:04.520 --> 42:10.200]  destabilization program and there's multiple films made on it cartel and one and two if you
[42:10.200 --> 42:14.920]  want to see the truth and it is eye-opening the problem is the drug cartels and government then
[42:14.920 --> 42:21.480]  just arrest or plane crash or kill all the real mexican leaders they just kill them just just
[42:21.480 --> 42:27.880]  kill them or plane crash them or arrest them plane crashes shoot them arrest them the guys that won't
[42:27.880 --> 42:34.520]  sell out and then they take control of leadership that way but at least the mexicans are fighting
[42:34.520 --> 42:41.640]  back at one point it's just to see this is so disgusting and to know we're going down the exact
[42:41.640 --> 42:47.320]  same road but that's where this is going where you don't sell out they just kill you or put you
[42:47.320 --> 42:51.720]  in prison that's exactly where they're going in this country because they can't beat us they can't
[42:51.720 --> 42:56.760]  beat our rhetoric they can't beat our information so after i've covered all this i want to ask you
[42:56.760 --> 43:04.760]  the question again is is is is is donald trump bad because he says we're not vetting these people
[43:04.760 --> 43:11.880]  we're letting them in they've got fake passports it's time to block all muslims until they fix
[43:11.880 --> 43:16.200]  this and they've got all these other staged events with republican activists republican
[43:16.200 --> 43:20.520]  chiefs of staff putting their hands on their hips doing the thing to manipulate women and
[43:20.520 --> 43:27.880]  going why do you hate women with it it's all stunts and i'm not saying donald trump's perfect
[43:27.880 --> 43:32.280]  but i have to know behind the scenes he can be influenced he can admit when he's wrong
[43:32.280 --> 43:39.560]  but he's not influenced by money he is influenced by actually trying to be strong and save the
[43:39.560 --> 43:43.720]  country does it mean he's perfect certainly not does it mean a man on a white horse is dangerous
[43:43.720 --> 43:52.760]  absolutely but we're already run by globalist who are on jet black red-eyed mains of hell
[43:56.040 --> 44:00.600]  i mean we know we're in the hand of a takeover and it's beyond barack obama they want to break
[44:00.600 --> 44:08.200]  this country now once and for all and it's such a serious time to be alive right now so supreme
[44:08.200 --> 44:12.440]  court rules locals can take your guns and ban your guns and register your guns
[44:14.440 --> 44:18.040]  hubby can post another say look yes we want to ban them that's our plan now let's do it
[44:19.080 --> 44:23.160]  here's another one how obama is using the grossly unconstitutional no flyless to push
[44:23.160 --> 44:30.840]  gun control powerful article breaking that down very dangerous syed ferruc's mysterious 28,500
[44:30.840 --> 44:36.520]  dollar bank deposit san bernie notaris investigated week before attack by police but political
[44:36.520 --> 44:42.120]  correctness did nothing lieutenant colonel on obama this guy is such a total pussycat he said more
[44:42.120 --> 44:49.640]  than that it's stunning no colonel he's not a wimp he is a precision globalist to take down the
[44:49.640 --> 44:57.560]  nation state oh he won't get tough on ices he runs ices we don't need tough talk and cuss words
[44:59.000 --> 45:04.760]  out of suspended fox analysts two of them for making stunt statements in fact let's play
[45:04.760 --> 45:10.760]  one of those clips here in just a moment shan bernie no democrats are calling out calling for
[45:10.760 --> 45:19.320]  total gun control so that's what's going on on that front here is the clip of the retired lieutenant
[45:19.320 --> 45:25.480]  colonel calling obama a wimp he's not a wimp he is defeating the republic that the british empire
[45:25.480 --> 45:30.600]  couldn't defeat he's defeating the republic the soviet union couldn't defeat he is defeating
[45:30.600 --> 45:36.680]  america he is defeating the family he is defeating gun owners he is defeating the republic he
[45:36.680 --> 45:43.480]  defeated us with obama care he defeated us bringing in millions of illegals with no ids on record and
[45:43.480 --> 45:49.880]  kept it secret that the border patrol was bringing them in he is the devastator he is the great enemy
[45:50.600 --> 45:57.880]  we better have our full resolve and commitment to defeat this let's go to this clip right rough i
[45:57.880 --> 46:03.080]  have a question for you i know you watched last night i want to know what were you saying to the
[46:03.080 --> 46:08.440]  tv as the president was speaking what was your commentary as this uh as the president speech
[46:08.440 --> 46:18.600]  unfolded uh first of all he keeps speaking about we can't give into our fears um you know don't be
[46:18.600 --> 46:24.360]  afraid look mr president we're not afraid we're angry we're pissed off we're furious yes we want
[46:24.360 --> 46:29.720]  to see you to react we want you to do something you're afraid i mean this guy is such a total
[46:29.720 --> 46:36.360]  f***ing it's stunning and you know we want the we the people the american people whom he he does not
[46:36.360 --> 46:43.720]  know in any intimate story all right no obama doesn't know anything right colonel that is red meat
[46:43.720 --> 46:49.080]  stunt and that very colonel is connected to grips i want to get him on with the neocons that are
[46:49.080 --> 46:56.920]  saying hit aside knowing the public's illiterate about geo politics these are the people with
[46:56.920 --> 47:02.760]  obama and the republican leadership mccain supporting what's been done and the war crime on
[47:02.760 --> 47:11.400]  our hands and our name murdering 300 000 people 200 000 of them conservatively christians and the west
[47:11.400 --> 47:17.720]  won't let the christians out turkey won't let them come across and laugh at them because the christians
[47:17.720 --> 47:23.480]  have the most productive farms and fields and you name it showing it's not the race of the people
[47:23.480 --> 47:29.640]  it's the culture you know in uruguay paraguay police and a bunch of other south american countries
[47:29.640 --> 47:34.920]  you know who produces upwards of 90 percent of all the food and dairy and who allows those countries
[47:34.920 --> 47:43.400]  to operate amish from germany and from switzerland and from the netherlands who've been there 300
[47:43.400 --> 47:53.400]  plus years who left europe during the reformation to get religious freedom they're so productive
[47:53.400 --> 47:58.760]  that those countries live off of them and even in socialist countries they exempt the amish from
[47:58.760 --> 48:05.400]  the laws or they'll leave their kids don't take inoculations their kids don't go to school with
[48:05.400 --> 48:09.640]  the system their kid they don't have to have the driver's license they do what they want because
[48:09.640 --> 48:15.640]  they produce everything and they have basically a zero crime rate same thing and the same thing
[48:15.640 --> 48:20.360]  in syria look at the demographics the christians are a big minority there and you go into their
[48:20.360 --> 48:25.720]  areas there's fields big trees everywhere all these wells dug over a thousand plus years ago
[48:25.720 --> 48:31.080]  1900 years ago all this money all this wealth muslims living right next door to him everybody's
[48:31.080 --> 48:35.800]  friends everything's nice and then here come marching over out of iraq and
[48:37.640 --> 48:46.360]  Saudi arabia giant death forces just murdering everyone and the neocons sit there like you're
[48:46.360 --> 48:56.360]  so stupid like you're so mindless and tell you obama needs to get tough and go after isis you
[48:56.360 --> 49:01.160]  get tough on obama pointing out he runs the stinking thing like colonel shaffer and countless others
[49:01.160 --> 49:07.640]  have documented and like the iraqi president says and like the russian president says that's the
[49:07.640 --> 49:13.400]  truth not all these tough guys on fox news about how we need to take out a sod obama's been weak on
[49:13.400 --> 49:19.640]  a sod and that's why they just give an isis a stronghold no our government created this group
[49:19.640 --> 49:26.600]  as general the head of dia and others have said now i'm gonna go to break i'm gonna come back over
[49:26.600 --> 49:30.440]  the break and get into the rest of the attack on donald trump because regardless what you think
[49:30.440 --> 49:35.960]  about donald trump he now represents the opposition and if they can destroy him it'll be another major
[49:35.960 --> 49:42.120]  defeat for freedom but i'm telling you he knows what he's doing and that's why they're scared of him
[49:42.120 --> 49:47.400]  has taken me time to really look at all the angles but i've gone from about trust in trump 60 percent
[49:47.400 --> 49:54.040]  to about 95 percent but i know this he's not hillary clinton i know this ladies and gentlemen
[49:54.680 --> 50:03.880]  he's not bernie sanders he's not diane feinstein he's not al gore now let's continue we have free

[54:05.480 --> 54:10.120]  this is the takedown of the west this is the destruction of the existing world system for a
[54:10.120 --> 54:14.680]  new world order to be built on its ashes the globalists think we're so dumb they admit all this
[54:14.680 --> 54:19.640]  in the council on foreign relations buy monthly book foreign affairs you can buy at barns and
[54:19.640 --> 54:26.760]  noble or anywhere else or you can read it online at cfr.org i mean that's what's so frustrating
[54:26.760 --> 54:33.160]  about this is they admit their whole plan three years ago they had the headline why we need al-qaeda
[54:33.160 --> 54:39.080]  in syria admitting that our government was arming al-qaeda because see if they kept it secret it
[54:39.080 --> 54:42.520]  come out and they'd all go to jail but if they admitted it means it almost makes it like it's
[54:42.520 --> 54:49.960]  okay like yeah we're finding al-qaeda it's like okay it's all right you told us but that's not
[54:49.960 --> 54:55.480]  outrageous donald trump saying block all muslims coming into the united states that aren't citizens
[54:55.480 --> 55:03.160]  basically is what he's saying until we can vet that's common sense now we're running another

[01:01:38.600 --> 01:01:42.840]  across this country at public schools and then just covering it up they're breaking the law
[01:01:42.840 --> 01:01:48.760]  ordering the police to have different enforcement policies that are interpretations of law that are
[01:01:48.760 --> 01:01:55.000]  clearly not correct that throw people in jail for their speech we have every day i see articles
[01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:59.240]  where people building a small barn on their own family property are being arrested
[01:02:02.920 --> 01:02:06.680]  we see the federal government creating all these local federalized bureaus
[01:02:08.600 --> 01:02:15.880]  and their strong cities initiative putting us under un control and the attorney general saying
[01:02:15.880 --> 01:02:21.720]  we'll arrest you for your speech if you criticize his llamasist that's directly out of the
[01:02:21.720 --> 01:02:27.160]  strong cities initiative is what they said they do it's the southern primary law center the un and
[01:02:27.160 --> 01:02:34.760]  the adl that are the most america hating lying filthy organizations you could ever imagine
[01:02:36.920 --> 01:02:42.200]  involved in just unbelievable garbage the southern primary law center specifically
[01:02:42.920 --> 01:02:49.000]  engaged in things that make your head spin there's a john wolfton's and store a strong
[01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:55.000]  cities network trilateral cfr Rothschild connections yeah it's the un you know i had paul craig robertson
[01:02:55.000 --> 01:03:00.520]  who i respect and is really smart but i was saying you know they're announcing that we're
[01:03:00.520 --> 01:03:04.840]  going to be under un regulations he goes all the un done right and then it works for the big globalist
[01:03:04.840 --> 01:03:11.960]  and i and it's like yeah i know that dr roberts but they create the imf the world bank the xm bank
[01:03:11.960 --> 01:03:20.520]  the tpp the wto and then they transfer the the regulatory power to them and then pivot back
[01:03:20.520 --> 01:03:25.880]  and forth between the federal and and the outside above the law command base they built and then
[01:03:25.880 --> 01:03:31.720]  come back with regulations that they then write laws to to conform with so that's how they get us
[01:03:31.720 --> 01:03:40.040]  in a vice and you read this stuff by the justice department and it says we'll go after people's
[01:03:40.040 --> 01:03:46.280]  free speech under un rules both the the e you does that they're banning reporting islamic rape
[01:03:47.480 --> 01:03:53.480]  they're arresting members of parliament that criticize radical islam mildly they're ending
[01:03:53.480 --> 01:04:00.520]  free speech in europe they tried to shut down a showing a martin reyno's new film that he stars in
[01:04:00.520 --> 01:04:05.880]  he'll be joining us in about 25 minutes from now this is an unprecedented time to be alive
[01:04:05.880 --> 01:04:11.720]  and i know people can't believe they're actually going to put you in control over us i know people
[01:04:11.720 --> 01:04:16.200]  can't believe they're actually announcing world government but still when it's all announced
[01:04:16.200 --> 01:04:21.720]  people don't go wow alex you were right again i you know i guess i guess you just did more research
[01:04:21.720 --> 01:04:29.240]  than we did it's it's just still oh there's no un uh taking over it's it's not happening as it happens
[01:04:30.840 --> 01:04:35.560]  global crime syndicates want their own government they don't want to have to buy off our government
[01:04:35.560 --> 01:04:42.840]  anymore they want it subserving it to what they run but it's all illegitimate whether it's run from
[01:04:42.840 --> 01:04:47.880]  here or run from the hay or run from new york city i mean they announced last week they're putting
[01:04:47.880 --> 01:04:54.680]  the un a new un building or buildings in dc to admittedly coordinate the local government and
[01:04:54.680 --> 01:05:03.400]  police the un i'm a proud muslim but you don't have to share my faith to share my disgust that
[01:05:03.400 --> 01:05:08.280]  was written by hillary clinton's right hand woman huma abedin who penned the email in response to
[01:05:08.280 --> 01:05:12.760]  donald trump's recent proposition to impose a complete and total shutdown of muslims entering
[01:05:12.760 --> 01:05:17.320]  the united states you know it was the fbi director the head of counterterrorism and homeland security
[01:05:17.320 --> 01:05:22.200]  who all said under oath that they cannot properly vet people coming in from syria but let's take
[01:05:22.200 --> 01:05:27.400]  a look at miss abedin back in 2012 five republicans sent a letter to the department of homeland
[01:05:27.400 --> 01:05:32.360]  security noting that three of her family members had very close ties to the muslim brotherhood
[01:05:32.360 --> 01:05:36.600]  she was also intimately involved in hillary clinton's email scandal and while she was at
[01:05:36.600 --> 01:05:41.880]  the state department miss abedin helped our country cozy up to chic yusuf al qawardi a promoter of
[01:05:41.880 --> 01:05:46.360]  jihadist terror and one of her many accomplishments while at the state department was helping destroy
[01:05:46.360 --> 01:05:51.160]  the country of libya i'm sure her and her muslim brotherhood friends are very proud of that achievement
[01:05:51.160 --> 01:05:55.560]  just imagine what she can do and her best pal hillary clinton gets into the white house rob

[01:11:34.120 --> 01:11:39.240]  submitting we should stop all this immigration until we've got a vetting process in or we're not
[01:11:39.240 --> 01:11:44.360]  going to be knowing uh who these people are and we could be hit by terrorists in fact we predict
[01:11:44.360 --> 01:11:49.880]  it will be these are quotes in congress in fact we'll do a longer version and actually add the
[01:11:49.880 --> 01:11:55.800]  quotes not just show the articles and then trump says okay because they're not being vetted ban all
[01:11:55.800 --> 01:12:02.520]  muslims new muslims from coming in that's actually not a radical statement what's radical is bringing
[01:12:02.520 --> 01:12:10.200]  people in unvetted from war zones like syria these are jihad pilgrims that were unable to take over
[01:12:10.200 --> 01:12:16.280]  syria and murder every christian and shia they got their crazy hands on you got these fruit
[01:12:16.280 --> 01:12:24.360]  cakes like melissa harris perry on tv saying don't show malik the jihad princess who ran the attack
[01:12:24.360 --> 01:12:30.440]  killing 14 people reportedly in hajib in her in her in her head covering because that
[01:12:30.440 --> 01:12:33.480]  stereotypes muslims that's what they wear lady
[01:12:33.480 --> 01:12:40.600]  it's like saying don't show george washington a trot cornered hat that's what he wore
[01:12:42.600 --> 01:12:47.480]  like let's go to that club here it is and then all of a sudden we find out they're muslim
[01:12:47.480 --> 01:12:51.880]  bam gun violence is out of the question we start talking about terrorism and i'm
[01:12:51.880 --> 01:12:55.720]  extremely disturbed i mean i looked at the new york times cover today here you have
[01:12:55.720 --> 01:13:00.600]  a whole op-ed on gun control great right next to it is pictures from the apartment
[01:13:00.600 --> 01:13:05.720]  of things that i have in my house yes like these are things that all muslims have in their house
[01:13:05.720 --> 01:13:10.360]  there's nothing about that that tells you a story about what terrors have looked like so
[01:13:10.360 --> 01:13:14.920]  you're telling me that while my friends who are not muslim come into my home and see see a quran
[01:13:14.920 --> 01:13:19.800]  or see frames on the wall with a scripture from my from my religion that is that supposed to tell
[01:13:19.800 --> 01:13:23.480]  you something i mean it's absolutely outrageous we would never do that to anyone and we didn't do
[01:13:23.480 --> 01:13:28.680]  that to to dear we didn't do that to roof i'm i'm tired of the double standards of how we treat
[01:13:28.680 --> 01:13:33.800]  muslims they are the perfect that image and then also right next to it an image of the
[01:13:33.800 --> 01:13:39.400]  shooting suspect there in his job and that idea that like okay this is what terrorism looks like
[01:13:40.920 --> 01:13:45.320]  for me that that is a difference and it is a material and meaningful difference
[01:13:46.280 --> 01:13:52.360]  i love this pea brain um this academic leader Melissa Harris Perry up there
[01:13:52.360 --> 01:13:58.920]  lisping with all her jewels on her finery and her hair and and just oh i love it i love anything
[01:13:58.920 --> 01:14:05.320]  far anything oppressive oh yeah what if i could be in a slave dungeon oh yeah i mean this is what
[01:14:05.320 --> 01:14:10.600]  she'd really be saying if she was agreeing with reality but she's up there acting like it's bad to
[01:14:10.600 --> 01:14:18.600]  show muslim women wearing their headdresses wearing their burkas and that she's on the tv
[01:14:18.600 --> 01:14:26.600]  with a woman wearing one and then we're supposed to didn't follow whatever they say or whatever they
[01:14:26.600 --> 01:14:31.800]  do now here is donald trump the associated press has it clipped down in the full speech which they
[01:14:31.800 --> 01:14:37.320]  now got transcripts of they've been caught taking out a context he said they're not vetting them
[01:14:37.320 --> 01:14:41.800]  they're not checking them they're letting them in the fbi admits this and until that's been fixed
[01:14:41.800 --> 01:14:47.800]  until we can verify who these people are it's now time as i've tweeted and then he goes over the tweet
[01:14:47.800 --> 01:14:54.040]  to ban all muslims coming into the country which means coming in who aren't americans aren't citizens
[01:14:54.040 --> 01:15:02.040]  that just goes to say that coming in means new they spent it to go he wants to deport all muslims
[01:15:02.040 --> 01:15:07.720]  he wants to well i tell you that's kind of where this is going when they launch the real jihad
[01:15:07.720 --> 01:15:12.200]  they bring in hundreds of thousands more there will be more attacks in this country and you're not
[01:15:12.200 --> 01:15:15.960]  going to be able to spend it over and over again as you keep bringing in the very people that attack
[01:15:15.960 --> 01:15:21.880]  and then all the reasonable muslims that came here mainly to get away from the wahhabist tyranny
[01:15:21.880 --> 01:15:30.280]  are going to get the blame and again i've got it in the news literally 99 plus percent of the immigrants
[01:15:31.800 --> 01:15:34.600]  out of 200 plus on average they have one christian
[01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:43.640]  that's in the news today that's over 99 percent are islamists that's 200 plus percent are
[01:15:43.640 --> 01:15:49.480]  and then he says we got people under attack we got to bring them in you don't bring the christians
[01:15:49.480 --> 01:15:56.520]  or shiites in you bring in the people that got their butts kicked your jihad army he said come to daddy
[01:15:56.520 --> 01:16:00.760]  you can blow some stuff up and shoot some people here and we'll declare martial law like they did
[01:16:00.760 --> 01:16:06.440]  in europe and our public so don't ever figure it out come here you want some milk to the taxpayer
[01:16:06.440 --> 01:16:12.440]  then obama unbuttons his jacket opens his shirt up and goes you want some milk al-qaeda let me shove
[01:16:12.440 --> 01:16:20.040]  some taxpayer money in your fat little cheeks thank you lord obama we don't even have to pay for the
[01:16:20.040 --> 01:16:30.040]  women now how much for your daughter and people go oh that's stereotypical it's stereotypical about
[01:16:30.040 --> 01:16:35.560]  some of the bad areas the middle east run by wahhabist because that's what they do i mean
[01:16:35.560 --> 01:16:41.160]  it's like in laurence of arabia the turks raping that's what they do but then that's the thing just
[01:16:41.160 --> 01:16:47.000]  you know turkish jail you're gonna get raped by the jail guards nine times out of ten yeah you know
[01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:51.000]  all these fancy pants liberal women fly over saudi arabia with some rich chic and 20 years later
[01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:57.960]  they're locked up in a dungeon in a sex slave camp you know they have stereotypes of harems of
[01:16:57.960 --> 01:17:03.640]  captured women because that's what they do see it's not a stereotype just like there's a stereotype
[01:17:03.640 --> 01:17:09.240]  of folks in south texas riding around on on horses and living in ranch houses that's because
[01:17:09.240 --> 01:17:13.640]  that's what they do it's a stereotype you mess with them you're gonna get your teeth kicked in
[01:17:13.640 --> 01:17:19.000]  that's because that's what they do see how that works too see stereotypes are real crazy aggressive
[01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:24.840]  texans yeah yeah that's right but only get angry these are going crazy when you mess with them
[01:17:24.840 --> 01:17:30.040]  yeah that's stereotypes true isn't it stereotypes just keep on being true over and over again don't
[01:17:30.040 --> 01:17:35.880]  they you think you're the only crazy ones new world order you only awake on the sleeping giant
[01:17:35.880 --> 01:17:43.480]  you trash you filthy scum we see your god awful plan i want to play the trump clip but
[01:17:44.280 --> 01:17:48.680]  i'm so angry i can hardly breathe right now i'm just i'm just ready to roar folks i'm afraid to
[01:17:48.680 --> 01:17:54.920]  run around in circles so angry let's show some of my tweets that i want you to retweet that are
[01:17:54.920 --> 01:18:04.040]  real alex jones right now let's go to him media is misquoting real donald trump full speech he
[01:18:04.040 --> 01:18:09.560]  said ban new muslims until they're vetted more lies from horror media that's an alex jones quote
[01:18:10.280 --> 01:18:15.560]  real donald trump is right about barring foreign muslims until they are all vetted
[01:18:15.560 --> 01:18:21.320]  in full wars dot com retweet that at trump he needs to defend himself that way i don't care
[01:18:21.320 --> 01:18:27.160]  even retweets us he needs to point that out because they are spinning this thing now wants to
[01:18:27.160 --> 01:18:33.080]  deport muslims you know who i want to deport let's say we brought in a hundred thousand north
[01:18:33.080 --> 01:18:37.960]  koreans and never vetted them and most of them came here believing kim jong-un was still wonderful
[01:18:37.960 --> 01:18:41.800]  and kim jong-il was wonderful and then he actually makes the birds singing all the rest of it like
[01:18:41.800 --> 01:18:47.480]  they teach in north korea and then a few of them started blowing stuff up and shooting people and
[01:18:47.480 --> 01:18:52.920]  the government wanted to bring more of them in i'd say you know what if we don't get loyalty
[01:18:52.920 --> 01:18:56.920]  pledges like citizens are supposed to do and other statements from these north koreans get
[01:18:56.920 --> 01:19:03.160]  them out of here and maybe we shouldn't bring any more north koreans in here same deal they're from
[01:19:03.160 --> 01:19:08.760]  a whacked out crazy area under cult level programming don't bring these people in it's kind of like
[01:19:08.760 --> 01:19:14.120]  don't let the maryland manson family or excuse me manson family not maryland manson don't let the
[01:19:14.120 --> 01:19:18.760]  manson family killers out of jail because they're still saying that they did the right thing and
[01:19:18.760 --> 01:19:23.800]  they're proud of it some of them what if there was a country full of maryland uh full of whatever
[01:19:23.800 --> 01:19:29.720]  that idiot's name what was charles manson charles manson a country full of charles manson's
[01:19:29.720 --> 01:19:34.440]  pledging allegiance to charles manson who want to come here and kill us do we bring them in here
[01:19:34.440 --> 01:19:44.280]  no no no we're gonna come back with trump and more straight ahead but i'm telling you this is it
[01:19:44.280 --> 01:19:48.840]  and i just like trump being bold because to get attention to the issues he has to be bold
[01:19:48.840 --> 01:19:52.840]  and he's absolutely right i can't go to saudi arabia and preach the gospel i'll have my head

[01:24:19.640 --> 01:24:26.760]  until our country's representatives can figure out what the hell is going on
[01:24:28.840 --> 01:24:35.640]  there you go from center for security policy released data showing 25 percent of those polled
[01:24:36.280 --> 01:24:43.800]  agreed that violence against americans these are people that are here by the way people here
[01:24:43.800 --> 01:24:50.840]  right 25 not one percent by the way one percent would be unacceptable one percent is unacceptable
[01:24:50.840 --> 01:24:58.840]  that's right 25 percent of those polled agreed that violence against americans here in the united
[01:24:58.840 --> 01:25:10.360]  states is justified as part think of that as part of the global jihad until we are able to

[01:25:18.840 --> 01:25:28.280]  the victim of horrendous attacks by people that believe only in jihad now there is basically
[01:25:28.280 --> 01:25:33.000]  in context from different pieces of the speech what he said they're not being vetted we don't
[01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:37.640]  know what's going on they're coming out of jihad areas 25 percent national polls say they support

[01:25:43.480 --> 01:25:50.200]  thousands of jihadis this is crazy america's never done stuff like this so they make it a
[01:25:50.200 --> 01:25:56.200]  debate about muslims or not when these are groups of people out murdering muslims these are sunni
[01:25:56.200 --> 01:26:03.640]  shiites war going on these are lohabiist sunnis that hate shiites christians and others and
[01:26:03.640 --> 01:26:09.240]  traditionally it's shiite areas like iran syria and others where they let christians live in peace
[01:26:09.240 --> 01:26:13.080]  and i'm not saying they're perfect either but the these two groups are killing each other it's a

[01:33:19.400 --> 01:33:29.800]  they're trying to censoring but first off we've got donald trump on msnbc with the morning neocon
[01:33:31.560 --> 01:33:37.800]  arguing with him it's pretty incendiary here it is you believe that we need members of the muslim
[01:33:37.800 --> 01:33:43.160]  american community of the muslim community around the world to help fight the war on terror and
[01:33:43.160 --> 01:33:49.000]  perhaps that this is incredibly counterproductive no i think it's something that has to be done
[01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:53.240]  i think it's a temporary move i'm not looking at this long term i'm looking at a temporary we
[01:33:53.240 --> 01:33:58.520]  have to get our hands around a very serious problem look at what happened in paris horrible
[01:33:58.520 --> 01:34:03.400]  carnage and frankly mika if you look at paris and i hate to do this because the commerce
[01:34:03.400 --> 01:34:08.920]  department of paris uh the chamber of commerce is going to go crazy but paris is no longer the same
[01:34:08.920 --> 01:34:13.960]  city it was they have sections in paris that are radicalized where the police refuse to go there
[01:34:13.960 --> 01:34:19.560]  they're petrified the police refuse to go in there we have places in london and other places
[01:34:19.560 --> 01:34:25.240]  that are so radicalized that the police are afraid for their own lives uh we have to be
[01:34:25.240 --> 01:34:31.640]  very smart and very vigilant we have to find out who gave this guy 28 000 put it in his account
[01:34:31.640 --> 01:34:37.640]  how many other 28 000 checks were made are there thousands all over the country when you say you're
[01:34:37.640 --> 01:34:42.760]  afraid i think you should be afraid you should be afraid of the other side not my side i want to
[01:34:42.760 --> 01:34:50.360]  get our hands around a very difficult situation all right donald you gotta let us ask questions
[01:34:50.360 --> 01:34:54.840]  you can't just talk no you gotta let us ask questions you're just talking we're gonna play
[01:34:54.840 --> 01:34:59.240]  more as soon as we've talked to marmarano on this but but the headline here is donald trump
[01:34:59.240 --> 01:35:04.520]  warns of sleeper cells so you see how the media spun this if you go to the full speech he says
[01:35:04.520 --> 01:35:09.880]  until they vet them until they background check them until they stop you know pledging allegiance
[01:35:09.880 --> 01:35:15.400]  to isis we cannot have any of these new groups come in until we've done this it's a temporary thing
[01:35:15.400 --> 01:35:20.600]  they then turn it into deport the muslims kick all the muslims out don't let muslims in uh
[01:35:20.600 --> 01:35:24.920]  donald trump doesn't want to fight radical terror our government has been funding these groups
[01:35:24.920 --> 01:35:33.480]  our government is what's bringing them in okay so obviously the first thing you do is you stop
[01:35:33.480 --> 01:35:40.120]  bringing the quote refugees in who are really an invasion force most of them of military age men
[01:35:40.120 --> 01:35:45.800]  who aren't from there 80 percent or higher are not from syria they're almost all sunnis they're
[01:35:45.800 --> 01:35:50.840]  not christians they're not sheites they're coming in they they're acting like an invasion force in
[01:35:50.840 --> 01:35:57.960]  europe running around raping robbing killing and i'm sorry what trump is saying is true it's not
[01:35:57.960 --> 01:36:01.880]  radical when you've got an open border and the government bringing these people in and not telling
[01:36:01.880 --> 01:36:07.880]  governors where they're going it is not radical to do this and to say this and i tell you what's
[01:36:07.880 --> 01:36:13.320]  refreshing about trump i saw this last night i saw it this morning i saw how they were spinning it
[01:36:13.320 --> 01:36:17.000]  and i thought we've got to get him out there explaining that what he really said because i
[01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:22.360]  read the full transcript was that until we get a handle on this the government's not doing its job
[01:36:22.360 --> 01:36:27.160]  we have to check passports they have to be real they can't have come from a terror training camp
[01:36:27.160 --> 01:36:32.840]  they can't have pledged allegiance and sure enough that's what he's out doing before i even was saying
[01:36:32.840 --> 01:36:40.920]  do it he gets it and so that's good but it just gets me so fired up it gets me so angry to see
[01:36:40.920 --> 01:36:51.000]  that we've gotten to this point all right do we have marmarina okay i just don't have audio then
[01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:57.880]  on those because i'm not hearing any audio just seeing them now
[01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:09.880]  this garbage makes me so angry at this point the way they attack common sense the way they demonize
[01:37:09.880 --> 01:37:14.280]  common sense and that all of us are supposed to watch what we say are not saying anything that's
[01:37:14.280 --> 01:37:19.480]  common sense because they'll take it out of context that's what they do they say on msnbc
[01:37:19.480 --> 01:37:25.320]  and cnn and vanity fair and the new york times that i say obama sent a tornado three years ago
[01:37:25.320 --> 01:37:30.680]  to attack oklahoma city there's no clip of me saying it because i didn't a woman called in and said
[01:37:30.680 --> 01:37:35.800]  they have weather weapons on the history channel and on the weather channel they admit they have
[01:37:35.800 --> 01:37:41.640]  them could this be a weather weapon and i said no probably not but can they create tornado fronts
[01:37:41.640 --> 01:37:47.720]  yes that turns into i said he sent a tornado they go on tv and they say that
[01:37:49.720 --> 01:37:53.880]  just all forms of lies that that that we didn't go to the moon i never said that
[01:37:55.160 --> 01:37:59.880]  they say that i say george bush in the fire department put bombs in the world trade centers
[01:37:59.880 --> 01:38:04.760]  i never said that i said our government bare minimum covered up for saudi arabia and 911
[01:38:04.760 --> 01:38:09.320]  and now that's been basically declassified this is how they misrepresent they go on the news
[01:38:09.320 --> 01:38:15.080]  they say donald trump wants five million dollars to go on cnn debate for himself he's greedy you
[01:38:15.080 --> 01:38:19.880]  go read what he actually said he said i want five million dollars donated to wound in warrior program
[01:38:20.920 --> 01:38:24.760]  this is the type of garbage they engage in and i'm sick of it now
[01:38:26.440 --> 01:38:34.600]  joining us is mark morano of climate depot dot com and he's one of the leading folks out there if
[01:38:34.600 --> 01:38:39.480]  you of course advise censor inhofe and congress for many years works with lord montan they have
[01:38:39.480 --> 01:38:45.320]  had to have protesters come out and try to shut down the showing of a new powerful film that he's in
[01:38:46.200 --> 01:38:50.920]  they're pushing open world government where they themselves are scripted cast as the saviors
[01:38:51.880 --> 01:38:56.920]  and they've got wanted posters up around the city for morano they're calling for a speech to be banned
[01:38:56.920 --> 01:39:02.840]  the eu is trying to pass a law as well as this new un conference to arrest morano lord montan and
[01:39:02.840 --> 01:39:08.360]  others seriously that's now in us newspapers they're at they have a criminal investigation is going
[01:39:08.360 --> 01:39:14.840]  on a new york state right now of a climate deniers so so this is the mind control climate depot
[01:39:14.840 --> 01:39:20.600]  dot com appreciate mark morano uh joining us on this situation but before we get into the climate
[01:39:20.600 --> 01:39:25.000]  and all the rest of it and world government separately what do you think of what's happening
[01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:29.080]  with trump and the 2016 election i mean i don't really even know your view on that but i'd like to
[01:39:29.080 --> 01:39:35.800]  know about this firestorm where they take things out of context to deceive people well i will say
[01:39:35.800 --> 01:39:43.720]  this about donald trump deserves the republican nomination for no other reason than he has shown
[01:39:43.720 --> 01:39:49.000]  republicans how to handle the mainstream media whether he's talking about obama's birth certificate
[01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:56.040]  a few years ago or every other issue from immigration to building a wall to terrorism
[01:39:56.040 --> 01:40:00.520]  he handles almost every single media interview he knows how to turn the tables he knows how to
[01:40:00.520 --> 01:40:06.360]  put the reporters on defensive the man is the most amazing political candidate i have ever seen
[01:40:06.360 --> 01:40:11.800]  especially as a media person and for that reason alone that's what i say he deserves the nomination
[01:40:11.800 --> 01:40:16.280]  just for that so he can teach other republicans how to handle the media no one even comes close
[01:40:16.280 --> 01:40:22.600]  the way he slaps them around the way they took over that that cnbc debate and made them a laughing
[01:40:22.600 --> 01:40:29.400]  stock it's he is popping the facade he is the todo finally pulling back the curtain on the little man
[01:40:30.680 --> 01:40:35.720]  yeah and the fact that he is beholden to no one and he's you know independently wealthy
[01:40:35.720 --> 01:40:40.360]  running for president is i think it's going to be very hard to overcome i mean i think he's on
[01:40:40.360 --> 01:40:46.200]  he's cruising to the nomination unless somehow the establishment gop finds some way to derail them
[01:40:46.200 --> 01:40:49.560]  whether they come up with some kind of scandal the only thing i can think of is a scandal that
[01:40:49.560 --> 01:40:54.520]  would derail them unless someone like Ted Cruz just really catches fire and comes on but i don't
[01:40:54.520 --> 01:40:59.640]  that you know i don't see that we'll see how that goes well i'm sure you know the inside
[01:40:59.640 --> 01:41:06.200]  talk in different camps let's leave it at that is a trump cruz duo with trump as the lead but if
[01:41:08.040 --> 01:41:12.600]  if cruz surges to the front it could be cruz trump i don't know if trump would take a second seat
[01:41:12.600 --> 01:41:17.960]  though i don't see i don't know that trump would be a good vice president he would be leading in
[01:41:17.960 --> 01:41:23.160]  the news every day the media would never leave him alone so i don't know that other people say he
[01:41:23.160 --> 01:41:27.800]  just wants to be the kingmaker in the end and just be the guy that endorses the next candidate and
[01:41:27.800 --> 01:41:31.800]  hold all the cards because people say he doesn't actually want the job of president because he
[01:41:31.800 --> 01:41:36.040]  wouldn't want to have to deal with all that mess and make all the compromises that some people
[01:41:36.040 --> 01:41:41.000]  say are necessary that he'd rather talk to folks that know him well a bunch of them and they say
[01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:46.840]  he's discovered globalism the new world order he's really informed now he's really upset and
[01:41:46.840 --> 01:41:50.600]  that he's for real and that he knows what the stakes are and he really does want to be president
[01:41:50.600 --> 01:41:56.280]  he's a hundred percent committed okay yeah well he if he if he keeps on this role i mean i think
[01:41:56.280 --> 01:42:00.040]  he's even matured even in some of these debates people say oh well he's been so quiet and some of
[01:42:00.040 --> 01:42:04.680]  them after you know that's actually that's a good sign it shows he doesn't have to dominate every
[01:42:04.680 --> 01:42:10.680]  single thing he says what he needs to and he's got he's assembling a team and he's uh he's just he
[01:42:10.680 --> 01:42:16.120]  knows the fight and the fight really at this point is battling the media no republicans
[01:42:16.120 --> 01:42:20.760]  ever really got that it's it's incredible certainly neither bush ever got it certainly
[01:42:20.760 --> 01:42:25.880]  mccain never got it certainly romney never got it no other republican nominee has got it ronald
[01:42:25.880 --> 01:42:33.080]  reagan understood that back in 1980 certainly uh but that's about it i mean trump really really
[01:42:33.080 --> 01:42:38.600]  has the the the mastery of skill that no other modern politician i mean he's certainly even
[01:42:38.600 --> 01:42:43.160]  better than ronald reagan when it comes to debating the media reagan never got into those kind of
[01:42:43.160 --> 01:42:48.920]  hand and how could the other republicans not get this when when the lapdog media are like frothing
[01:42:48.920 --> 01:42:55.320]  pit bulls or piranhas attacking them savagely with total bias why do republicans just grin and always
[01:42:55.320 --> 01:43:00.680]  be sweet about it instead of getting in their face well i don't know the worst is people like i think
[01:43:00.680 --> 01:43:06.040]  it was case it's campaign that case the campaign that did the ads of all of the alleged outrageous
[01:43:06.040 --> 01:43:10.360]  things trump had said and they're doing the ad and they're just feeding into that media frenzy
[01:43:10.360 --> 01:43:13.400]  they want to be reckoned they want they were they're still speaking that media
[01:43:14.440 --> 01:43:17.960]  approval they don't get it these other examples well here's an example and then i want to get
[01:43:17.960 --> 01:43:22.120]  into what you're doing the true new media what drudge is doing what others doing your film what's
[01:43:22.120 --> 01:43:27.240]  happening with this big climate conference but i do facebook mentions the average video now gets
[01:43:27.240 --> 01:43:32.520]  like 800 000 views i mean it's just i do like three or four this weekend they all got over 500 000
[01:43:32.520 --> 01:43:39.880]  views one had like 1.3 million uh i do youtube's and get 4 million a day now the the terrestrial
[01:43:39.880 --> 01:43:44.120]  show 3 million terrestrial listeners i mean conservatively it's 20 million this year a
[01:43:44.120 --> 01:43:48.120]  week listen it's going to be 30 million another year at current growth rates and then i tune in
[01:43:48.120 --> 01:43:53.800]  to see an end with an average 300 000 viewers they think they're god and they're nothing and they laugh
[01:43:53.800 --> 01:43:59.320]  at us like we're nothing when we're already hugely bigger than them i mean you talk about
[01:43:59.320 --> 01:44:06.120]  imper's new clothes mark yeah it's it's it's a it's a difference between going on you know
[01:44:06.120 --> 01:44:13.720]  whether it's a fox news or cnn uh cnn has like you know the most laughably low numbers and yet
[01:44:13.720 --> 01:44:19.880]  it still has unbelievable prestige inside the beltway people are still living in 1990 where they
[01:44:19.880 --> 01:44:25.640]  think cnn has a monopoly the political class both republican and democrat still treat that as though
[01:44:25.640 --> 01:44:30.680]  it's the end all be all for television and they they just they don't get it yet and that's where
[01:44:30.680 --> 01:44:35.880]  i think donald trump is hopefully whether he wins or loses at this point he's having a revolutionary
[01:44:35.880 --> 01:44:41.720]  effect i mean this is the way you do a campaign you you may you say what you mean and mean what you
[01:44:41.720 --> 01:44:46.200]  say and when the media comes after you you don't back down you don't be a marco rubio deer in the
[01:44:46.200 --> 01:44:51.800]  headlights which he does so well you do a donald trump and i think that you know that's why i think
[01:44:51.800 --> 01:44:56.920]  he's going to cruise the nomination sure i mean they called my famous it was the number one news
[01:44:56.920 --> 01:45:03.160]  debate of the year in 2013 and in major polls the situation with pierce morgan well his ratings
[01:45:03.160 --> 01:45:08.120]  began to trail out after that uh he fell apart i screamed at him and said this is all fake it's
[01:45:08.120 --> 01:45:12.520]  all facade you're here to take our guns i'm not playing the game with you if you try it a new
[01:45:12.520 --> 01:45:16.920]  revolution will start it's just calling them out as frauds and then of course a year later they
[01:45:16.920 --> 01:45:23.160]  admitted i destroyed him at first they declared victory no he was literally bleeding out politically
[01:45:23.160 --> 01:45:29.640]  on the floor in front of us yeah i remember that was great and yeah he didn't last that last that
[01:45:29.640 --> 01:45:35.320]  long at all uh and i think that's you're right they declare victory immediately because they think
[01:45:35.320 --> 01:45:41.560]  if you're outspoken and you're strong that somehow you've messed up because they're used to that weak
[01:45:41.560 --> 01:45:47.480]  need uh mealy mouse republican that capitulates on everything and they're not they just can't handle
[01:45:47.480 --> 01:45:51.800]  when someone comes out and and says tells it like it is and i think that's why they are just so
[01:45:51.800 --> 01:45:56.520]  confused and how many times have they declared trump's dead in the water just like they declared
[01:45:56.520 --> 01:46:00.840]  you know that you'd lost at the base they declare trump dead almost every time he makes
[01:46:00.840 --> 01:46:05.480]  they declare that you've been discredited they declare you've been discredited need to be arrested
[01:46:05.480 --> 01:46:09.800]  all over the world news when all your do is your credibility's mounting let's talk about the new film
[01:46:09.800 --> 01:46:14.600]  let's talk about paris now let's talk about climate depot and exactly what we're facing with this
[01:46:14.600 --> 01:46:20.520]  with this new climate conference well yeah first of all i woke up yesterday here in paris to signs
[01:46:20.520 --> 01:46:24.920]  all over the streets with my face on it because i'm doing my movie premiere here this i did the
[01:46:24.920 --> 01:46:29.240]  movie premiere last night for the film climate hustle it's a climate hustle dot com and climate
[01:46:29.240 --> 01:46:34.680]  depot i'm doing all the coverage i'll be uh and and what happened was there's a local environmental
[01:46:34.680 --> 01:46:39.640]  some french environmental group i'd never heard of put out these signs and now that they had wanted
[01:46:39.640 --> 01:46:46.840]  and they said for criminal do climate which means i'm a climate criminal and they're trying to they're
[01:46:46.840 --> 01:46:51.640]  trying to just say it's exposing me but at the same time this is a city they just had terror
[01:46:51.640 --> 01:46:58.680]  attacks i came from a country that has senator white house of uh road island calling for rico
[01:46:58.680 --> 01:47:03.800]  investigations in the film that i premiered last night and here at the hundred-year-old theater
[01:47:03.800 --> 01:47:09.960]  in paris we feature robert f kennedy jr calling for jailing skeptics saying that we deserve three
[01:47:09.960 --> 01:47:16.120]  males in a cot at the head with other war criminals for international tribunal we have a the united
[01:47:16.120 --> 01:47:23.400]  nations this week calling for reparations for climate misery we have we have um lined up developing
[01:47:23.400 --> 01:47:29.160]  world nations demanding cash in the developing world and basically we're we're allegedly racist
[01:47:29.160 --> 01:47:34.360]  and against poor people if we don't hand over the money meanwhile the the global warming skeptics
[01:47:34.360 --> 01:47:39.560]  here are the ones trying to promote energy that will actually give the developing world a chance
[01:47:39.560 --> 01:47:45.400]  and remove over one point one billion people out of poverty to have real energy not solar panel
[01:47:45.400 --> 01:47:50.920]  and huts made it done so the intimidation factor is huge i was i was joking that i would have to go
[01:47:50.920 --> 01:47:55.960]  in a secure undisclosed location or have a stunt double walk the red carpet but no we actually
[01:47:55.960 --> 01:48:01.880]  walked the red carpet and we invited we not invited but our event attracted a lot of protesters
[01:48:01.880 --> 01:48:06.120]  so much that the theater had to call the police and i i just sent your producer i hope he gets it
[01:48:06.120 --> 01:48:11.480]  up a video of the police arriving we had drunk protesters there they were trying to shove some
[01:48:11.480 --> 01:48:16.440]  of our people uh they were getting physical and they were doing all sorts of silly stunts they
[01:48:16.440 --> 01:48:22.360]  had signs calling a scum uh and we had phd scientists that were you know award-winning
[01:48:22.360 --> 01:48:26.840]  scientists walking the red carpet having to deal with all of this you know protest and nonsense
[01:48:26.840 --> 01:48:32.360]  here for the premiere well it shows how anti-free speech they are where they arrest lapin who's
[01:48:32.360 --> 01:48:36.760]  leading in presidential polls and whose party is sweeping the country with many other members of
[01:48:36.760 --> 01:48:42.920]  her family in politics as well and they actually she's facing a year in prison for saying that the
[01:48:42.920 --> 01:48:51.400]  islamic radical invasion is dangerous i mean these are anti-free speech yeah it's all about
[01:48:51.400 --> 01:48:56.600]  free speech in in fact the idea that if you stand up now and this is you know in the obama
[01:48:56.600 --> 01:49:01.640]  administration i can't the department had actually said we have no deniers in our agency now if you
[01:49:01.640 --> 01:49:07.000]  work for federal agency and the chief head of your agency says that that's a chilling effect you would
[01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:12.120]  never do anything to go against the alleged united nations al gore consensus same in the
[01:49:12.120 --> 01:49:19.240]  universities now same in um in politics to a large degree you can't dissent on this issue
[01:49:19.240 --> 01:49:24.920]  or you are ridiculed you're mocked you're attacked your funding is questioned your ethics are
[01:49:24.920 --> 01:49:29.080]  questioned and that's the whole idea now a lot of scientists that are speaking out
[01:49:29.080 --> 01:49:33.960]  are retired they don't care but imagine the effect this is having on the 30 40-year-old
[01:49:33.960 --> 01:49:38.200]  scientists who have their whole career trying to get tenure there's no way you're going to speak
[01:49:38.200 --> 01:49:44.760]  out on this issue when you know your academic career would end overnight art morano of climate
[01:49:44.760 --> 01:49:48.360]  depot dot com is our guest i mean clearly there's the whole point they're trying to restrict our
[01:49:48.360 --> 01:49:53.720]  free speech they're trying to pass some new agency at this un conference that will then restrict
[01:49:53.720 --> 01:49:58.920]  our free speech and prosecute us as war criminals i mean the truth is this is classical tyranny but
[01:49:58.920 --> 01:50:03.960]  the science is proving they're wrong now they call it climate change not warming uh what's the latest
[01:50:03.960 --> 01:50:10.360]  on that front on their conference itself well right now you know we're going to try about three
[01:50:10.360 --> 01:50:15.800]  four more days maybe even five days the way they do these and they are going they are they're going
[01:50:15.800 --> 01:50:20.680]  for the full monty on this this meeting this is the first time in six years that they are trying
[01:50:20.680 --> 01:50:25.640]  to get everything wrapped up in president obama now what's scary about this is president obama
[01:50:25.640 --> 01:50:31.160]  has surpassed the elindon baines johnson in terms of his ability to transform america where
[01:50:31.160 --> 01:50:36.600]  he's rivaling f dr at this point franklin delano roosevelt he has already passed global warming
[01:50:36.600 --> 01:50:42.920]  domestic legislation by bypassing congress through executive order through the epa now he wants this
[01:50:42.920 --> 01:50:49.240]  un treaty without having senate ratification a complete violation of the provisions in the
[01:50:49.240 --> 01:50:55.000]  constitution what he's trying to claim is because thank you george hw bush the first george bush
[01:50:55.000 --> 01:51:00.200]  signed the real earth summit treaty which began this whole mess a republican president republican
[01:51:00.200 --> 01:51:06.040]  senators helped ratify it back in 1992 president obama is claiming that this will merely be an
[01:51:06.040 --> 01:51:10.280]  update to that existing treaty now legal scholars have looked at that and said no way you can't
[01:51:10.280 --> 01:51:14.840]  have a new treaty with new commitments and a whole new framework and say it's part of an existing
[01:51:14.840 --> 01:51:19.400]  treaty merely an update but he'll probably get away with it why because he gets away with everything
[01:51:19.400 --> 01:51:24.200]  and republicans don't fight him so that's what's going to happen here because they're bullied by
[01:51:24.200 --> 01:51:31.400]  the toothless whore media that has no power and is discredited scum so after this week
[01:51:31.400 --> 01:51:37.960]  it's very possible america is saddled with epa climate domestic registration with legislation
[01:51:38.600 --> 01:51:42.920]  executive order which has already shut down hundreds of coal plants which is now going after
[01:51:42.920 --> 01:51:49.080]  our other other sources of energy oil and gas and now on top of that we're going to be adding
[01:51:49.080 --> 01:51:53.000]  an international agreement that's completely unconstitutional that he's not going to speak
[01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:58.360]  senate ratification for and we're going to be double dose now here's the problem much like
[01:51:58.360 --> 01:52:03.320]  obamacare and go back to social security of social security medicare think of the department of
[01:52:03.320 --> 01:52:09.160]  energy every time the federal government expands in america republicans always say oh we oppose
[01:52:09.160 --> 01:52:12.680]  this we're going to roll it back and they campaign on it how many republicans have campaigned on
[01:52:12.680 --> 01:52:17.560]  getting rid of the department of energy never happened probably never will happen well how
[01:52:17.560 --> 01:52:21.960]  many have now how many have campaigned on repealing obamacare it'd be a miracle at this
[01:52:21.960 --> 01:52:27.720]  point if it happens it's becoming implemented the same thing now even those skeptics alex we
[01:52:27.720 --> 01:52:32.760]  want every battle we've just stopped the kyoto protocol back in the 90s we stopped cap and trade
[01:52:32.760 --> 01:52:39.080]  we stopped carbon taxes gallup pollings is there's no more concern about global warming now in 2015
[01:52:39.080 --> 01:52:44.600]  in america than there was in 1989 global warming dead last among environment winning the battle
[01:52:44.600 --> 01:52:50.600]  for losing the war yes i'm trying to tell you that the american people are with us but it doesn't
[01:52:50.600 --> 01:52:56.360]  matter because obama bypassed democracy executive order we're getting global warming legislation
[01:52:56.360 --> 01:53:02.280]  and laws and regulations even though no one wants them because he's cunning and he's strong
[01:53:02.280 --> 01:53:06.680]  and republicans don't want to fight it let's expand on that it came out from last week's
[01:53:06.680 --> 01:53:11.400]  opec meeting and mainstream news i couldn't believe i read a story at cnn that was like five pages long
[01:53:11.400 --> 01:53:17.320]  that admitted the truth that saudi arabia and the u.s government are the main ones driving down oil
[01:53:17.320 --> 01:53:23.400]  prices to almost nothing and they admitted to bankrupt russia and us oil producers and that
[01:53:23.400 --> 01:53:28.680]  big oil was teamed up with saudi arabia to create a monopoly out of this and then massively jack up
[01:53:28.680 --> 01:53:34.600]  prices to five six seven dollars a gallon down the road but not until everybody's bankrupted except
[01:53:34.600 --> 01:53:40.680]  for saudi arabia showing how again saudi arabia admits they fund a lot of the global warming garbage
[01:53:40.680 --> 01:53:46.840]  to shut down us coal and us oil production and then you tell the average liberal this they just laugh
[01:53:46.840 --> 01:53:52.680]  at you even though it's an admitted fact that most of big oil is actually behind all this because
[01:53:52.680 --> 01:53:58.440]  they want to create artificial scarcity this is so sick so they keep it up way high to rip us off
[01:53:58.440 --> 01:54:03.720]  then they dive it down below what it should be to bankrupt their enemies so they can super screw
[01:54:03.720 --> 01:54:10.200]  job us in a couple years yeah i mean opec has a long history in the whole the whole idea of the
[01:54:10.200 --> 01:54:16.440]  oil price industry is like that so yeah anyone it's just look at the past decades going back
[01:54:16.440 --> 01:54:23.000]  at least and say the energy crisis in the 1970s and that is that is just one part of the problem
[01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:29.560]  but the other part here is our energy choices now that they're transferring all about anything
[01:54:29.560 --> 01:54:36.600]  remaining democrat democratic voices we have to an elite group of world leaders who are going to
[01:54:36.600 --> 01:54:42.120]  be deciding our energy economic choices and they're going to be doing it through central planning
[01:54:42.120 --> 01:54:48.440]  they openly speak of and this is their words not mine global governance we had al gore recently
[01:54:48.440 --> 01:54:55.160]  talk about fertility management is needed in africa because africa is projected to have sky
[01:54:55.160 --> 01:55:01.000]  rocketing population now al gore is a white wealthy westerner saying that we need fertility
[01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:06.600]  management of people of color in africa now if a conservative had said a white conservative had
[01:55:06.600 --> 01:55:11.080]  said we need that we need less africans in the world do you think he would be called the our word
[01:55:11.080 --> 01:55:15.960]  or not would he be called a racist al gore says it at a bill gates event and no one no one even yon
[01:55:16.680 --> 01:55:20.360]  that's a good point and expanding on that if you go back to the royal commission of population
[01:55:20.360 --> 01:55:26.120]  59 they said if we industrialize africa and asia and latin america they won't have too big a
[01:55:26.120 --> 01:55:29.720]  population but we don't want to do that because that'll make them politically independent so
[01:55:29.720 --> 01:55:35.320]  they keep them from industrializing their numbers explode they're poor then they want to come here
[01:55:35.320 --> 01:55:39.640]  and the leftist can take the ones that they want bring them in and make them their political
[01:55:39.640 --> 01:55:46.600]  zombies while then trying to wipe out and kill the over bloom now in 2016 i mean that's a sick plan
[01:55:47.640 --> 01:55:52.520]  well here's the thing the developing world and people and i get this all the time from the liberal
[01:55:52.520 --> 01:55:56.680]  global warming activists why are developing world they want a un treaty aren't they worried if they
[01:55:56.680 --> 01:56:01.400]  were really going to harm their people why would they want a treaty because the united nations is
[01:56:01.400 --> 01:56:06.200]  promising one trillion dollars a hundred billion dollars a year in what what they openly call the
[01:56:06.200 --> 01:56:11.480]  un has called it they will redistribute wealth by climate policy but five years ago you got the
[01:56:11.480 --> 01:56:16.920]  secret document ripping and actually basically doubled their taxes and it's a screw job right
[01:56:16.920 --> 01:56:21.640]  and so they they want to redistribute it so the idea that all these african nations south american
[01:56:21.640 --> 01:56:26.680]  nations they come here because they're demanding money not the people but the leaders and we're
[01:56:26.680 --> 01:56:31.720]  talking about massive tens of billions of dollars hundreds of billions to all these countries that
[01:56:31.720 --> 01:56:37.960]  are then going to be able to build giant monuments to themselves and new it's money for the union
[01:56:37.960 --> 01:56:43.960]  to colonize the world this they didn't get rid of colonialism it's called the bureaucratic
[01:56:43.960 --> 01:56:48.920]  capture they're going to be able to use that money to then buy votes and organize and ensure
[01:56:48.920 --> 01:56:53.720]  their reelection do doing nothing for the people the people will continue to have no running water
[01:56:53.720 --> 01:56:59.480]  no electricity massive poverty high infant mortality but they'll be now a part of a un treaty
[01:56:59.480 --> 01:57:04.360]  that's funneling money to a corrupt government that's their solution incredible out of allowing
[01:57:04.360 --> 01:57:08.920]  instead of allowing actual energy development and uh these countries that determine their own faith
[01:57:09.480 --> 01:57:14.760]  martin reyno you are hitting it on every point here how do we get the word out to the controlled
[01:57:14.760 --> 01:57:18.360]  left and the conservatives that these aren't environmental wackos they're taking the world
[01:57:18.360 --> 01:57:23.160]  over they know what they're doing i mean limbaugh listens to every word you say he calls them crazy
[01:57:23.160 --> 01:57:30.040]  wackos yeah their supporters are but at the top it's a giant criminal racket it is crony capitalism
[01:57:30.040 --> 01:57:37.480]  or bureaucratic uh colonialism selectively destroying the free market with inside groups of
[01:57:37.480 --> 01:57:45.080]  the un colonizing the world with their select system where they're above the law in our in our
[01:57:45.080 --> 01:57:49.800]  film climate hustle we actually have the phrase climate monarchy is what they want to establish
[01:57:49.800 --> 01:57:55.560]  and that's exactly what is i went and visited bersai here liwi the 14th you had a system you
[01:57:55.560 --> 01:58:00.200]  have the masses and we don't usually think of ourselves as the masses but that's what it is
[01:58:00.200 --> 01:58:04.920]  and this is where you see this with al gorely in order to capria the head of the un they live at
[01:58:04.920 --> 01:58:11.640]  30 000 feet and they and they live lavish lifestyles but yet they want to impose draconian restrictions
[01:58:11.640 --> 01:58:15.880]  on everyone else they want to choose how everyone else lives but they would never give up anything
[01:58:15.880 --> 01:58:21.160]  in their own life al gore actually had a blast on the screen of the academy awards you city transit
[01:58:21.160 --> 01:58:25.080]  as one of the things you could do to fight global warming when was the last time al gore was on a
[01:58:25.080 --> 01:58:29.960]  city bus they are the classic wicked rich that stole it they're not the free market that made

[01:58:38.360 --> 01:58:54.520]  i mean these people are pure evil stay with us and it's that type of behavior that spurred me
[01:58:54.520 --> 01:59:00.360]  to do the research to develop a true nutraceutical formula that was designed to smooth out and help
[01:59:00.360 --> 01:59:05.960]  children focus all of our children are hit with modern mind control television music fast food

[01:59:11.320 --> 01:59:17.080]  hammered daily by globalist concoctions it's no wonder they can't focus and calm down and then
[01:59:17.080 --> 01:59:22.120]  are put on dangerous psychotropic drugs working with my team we set out to find the best formula
[01:59:22.120 --> 01:59:26.360]  with the highest quality ingredients that children would actually like and take we worked with the
[01:59:26.360 --> 01:59:30.600]  leading manufacturer and nutritional supplements that are safe for children to bring you the most

[02:00:17.400 --> 02:00:25.640]  to alex jones you know if i caught my neighbor robbing me of my you know family jewelry or
[02:00:25.640 --> 02:00:30.440]  heirlooms or the television set i would get upset my blood pressure would elevate my heart rate would
[02:00:30.440 --> 02:00:35.640]  elevate i'd get in a butt kicking mood that's why this isn't an act when i get up here for
[02:00:35.640 --> 02:00:39.160]  three four hours and get angry and stir hyperventilating i mean i think about an open world
[02:00:39.160 --> 02:00:43.480]  government being announced they want to arrest everybody they want to screw over poor people
[02:00:43.480 --> 02:00:46.920]  and tell them they can't have cars or air conditioning that's an obama quote while he
[02:00:46.920 --> 02:00:53.800]  flies around on jumbo jets it's so over the top how bad these people are that i just can't even
[02:00:53.800 --> 02:00:59.800]  believe it but i guess they are the synthesis of the worst of the worst mark morano is our
[02:00:59.800 --> 02:01:06.440]  guest and what he said today is so key we've got to get aggressive in their face and meet their
[02:01:06.440 --> 02:01:12.840]  sickening hubris with our own focused aggression tirelessly that's why they're scared of what we
[02:01:12.840 --> 02:01:16.200]  do they're scared of mark morano they're scared of me they're scared of others because they know
[02:01:16.200 --> 02:01:21.400]  we see exactly who they are hypocritical scum mark we got four minutes left appreciate your time in
[02:01:21.400 --> 02:01:27.000]  paris what you're covering other points people should be aware of anything we can do uh to try
[02:01:27.000 --> 02:01:32.040]  to stop them i mean i know with their negotiations are quasi-secret they just kind of deploy against
[02:01:32.040 --> 02:01:37.080]  us whatever they want well here's where i think you know we talked about donald trump earlier
[02:01:37.080 --> 02:01:42.360]  we talked about ted cruick what republicans have failed to do and this includes the entire all the
[02:01:42.360 --> 02:01:47.080]  candidates they need to make this issue front and center now if you sit down with ted cruz or
[02:01:47.080 --> 02:01:51.240]  donald trump and carcin and you ask them about global warming and a few you have to keep it
[02:01:51.240 --> 02:01:56.120]  with follow-ups they'll say a lot of good things and they have a good plan the problem is when like
[02:01:56.120 --> 02:02:00.520]  they have these debates and they're about economics the first or second third sentence out of every
[02:02:00.520 --> 02:02:06.440]  republicans mouth should be talking about fighting the epa agenda the united nations climate agenda
[02:02:06.440 --> 02:02:10.920]  but it never comes up they just it's not on the radio by the way that's a winner that's a winner
[02:02:10.920 --> 02:02:15.960]  with the people i mean as you know it is but i mean i can't think of a single debate when global
[02:02:15.960 --> 02:02:19.640]  warming comes up in a debate it's all i do you believe do you not believe there's nothing to
[02:02:19.640 --> 02:02:23.720]  do with that it's got to do with what are you going to do they need to start talking about
[02:02:23.720 --> 02:02:28.760]  defunding the epa they need to start talking about withdrawing from the united nations climate
[02:02:28.760 --> 02:02:34.040]  agenda would stop funding of the climate panel they need to stop attending these un conferences
[02:02:34.040 --> 02:02:39.000]  none of that i've heard specifically it's certainly not it's not a lead in any of these debates this
[02:02:39.000 --> 02:02:43.160]  has to be part of their talking point and it worries me that they don't talk about it because
[02:02:43.160 --> 02:02:47.160]  if they're not talking about it as a lead issue i don't know that it's going to be a lead issue
[02:02:47.160 --> 02:02:51.720]  when they're elected and this is how tyranny happens from behind the scenes because this is
[02:02:51.720 --> 02:02:56.680]  going to be creeping and creeping these epa climate regs are starting out now and there
[02:02:56.680 --> 02:03:01.160]  once you get these in a bureaucracy like that and it's not challenged the epa they could be
[02:03:01.160 --> 02:03:07.480]  triple quadruple uh in terms of their impact in just five years ten years that's how these
[02:03:07.480 --> 02:03:11.880]  things grow they grow like a cancer underneath and i just don't see republicans make so the biggest
[02:03:11.880 --> 02:03:16.440]  thing is republican candidates for president because that's what everyone's paying attention to
[02:03:16.440 --> 02:03:21.000]  have to make this issue a sure i mean look at ram paul what they're going to do ram paul's a great
[02:03:21.000 --> 02:03:25.240]  guy but his people tell him to be so milk toast he's sinking like a lead weight and he thinks
[02:03:25.240 --> 02:03:33.080]  that's a winning strategy he's got to out trump trump yes and i and and it's exact and when i you
[02:03:33.080 --> 02:03:37.640]  know if you see what happened when republicans you go back to richard nixon and look at every
[02:03:37.640 --> 02:03:43.080]  republican epa administrator they're the most liberal member of every republican cabinet
[02:03:43.640 --> 02:03:48.760]  and what happens is what happened recently is every single former republican epa administrator
[02:03:48.760 --> 02:03:52.600]  came to capitol hill and endorsed president obama's climate regulations and it was a big
[02:03:52.600 --> 02:03:57.720]  deal the media went nuts oh look even republicans support it no it's because republican presidents
[02:03:57.720 --> 02:04:02.360]  don't want to look to the media like they're against the environment so they usually say oh
[02:04:02.360 --> 02:04:08.360]  i don't really care let's let's hand their bully they're intimidated so they look green so they
[02:04:08.360 --> 02:04:13.640]  appoint some kind of global warming activists we had christie todd whipman as dpa administrators
[02:04:13.640 --> 02:04:19.080]  we've had william ruckel's house we've had george bush had people that you know were embarrassingly
[02:04:19.080 --> 02:04:24.520]  bad as dpa and and then they turn around and they they they stab us in the back by coming out and
[02:04:24.520 --> 02:04:29.640]  endorsing everything president obama said so my fear is by republicans not talking about what
[02:04:29.640 --> 02:04:34.200]  they're going to do strongly as a lead talking point that they're going to get elected and say
[02:04:34.200 --> 02:04:38.680]  and do the same old game you know you know but let's try to look green on this issue at the point
[02:04:38.680 --> 02:04:43.800]  so the way to shoot it down is to expose the ultra redshirt pushing it to create a monopoly and
[02:04:43.800 --> 02:04:47.880]  that's why the republican leadership spot and paid for mark morano thank you for reporting from
[02:04:47.880 --> 02:04:52.840]  paris i want to report when you get back next week as well a climate depot folks check it out today
[02:04:52.840 --> 02:05:03.160]  i'm out on shows i'm a proud muslim but you don't have to share my faith to share my disgust
[02:05:03.160 --> 02:05:08.040]  that was written by hillary clinton's right-hand woman huma abedin who pinned the email in response
[02:05:08.040 --> 02:05:12.680]  to donald trump's recent proposition to impose a complete and total shutdown of muslims entering
[02:05:12.680 --> 02:05:17.240]  the united states you know it was the fbi director the head of counterterrorism and homeland security
[02:05:17.240 --> 02:05:22.120]  who all said under oath that they cannot properly vet people coming in from syria but let's take
[02:05:22.120 --> 02:05:27.320]  a look at miss abedin back in 2012 five republicans sent a letter to the department of homeland
[02:05:27.320 --> 02:05:32.280]  security noting that three of her family members had very close ties to the muslim brotherhood
[02:05:32.280 --> 02:05:36.840]  she was also intimately involved in hillary clinton's email scandal and while she was at the state
[02:05:36.840 --> 02:05:42.280]  department miss abedin helped our country cozy up to sheik yusuf al qawardi a promoter of jihadist
[02:05:42.280 --> 02:05:46.440]  terror and one of her many accomplishments while at the state department was helping destroy the
[02:05:46.440 --> 02:05:51.160]  country of libya i'm sure her and her muslim brotherhood friends are very proud of that achievement
[02:05:51.160 --> 02:05:55.320]  just imagine what she can do in her best pal hillary clinton gets into the white house
[02:05:55.320 --> 02:06:04.840]  rob do reporting for info wars dot com and it's that type of behavior that spurred me to do the

[02:08:18.840 --> 02:08:24.040]  then david night's coming up we have a special report filed by joe biggs that's really good
[02:08:24.600 --> 02:08:31.640]  josh owens and others put together confirming that yes syria law is in large areas of the united
[02:08:31.640 --> 02:08:39.640]  states we have video of it all in detroit and other cities of the united states so they're
[02:08:39.640 --> 02:08:45.000]  going to be airing that seven-minute special report during the fourth hour today and a lot more
[02:08:46.280 --> 02:08:53.560]  now i wanted to get joe scalzen on he was on last weekend just on the unfolding turkey going into
[02:08:53.560 --> 02:09:00.120]  iraq turkey threatening to blow up russian ships i mean major escalation but also you've got the big
[02:09:00.120 --> 02:09:05.240]  story uh is that trump says deport muslims is how they've spun it or don't let muslims in what he
[02:09:05.240 --> 02:09:11.560]  said was until there's a system in place to know who they are you can't let people in well obviously
[02:09:11.560 --> 02:09:17.400]  that's the scandal is they're letting them in and is it for sleeper cells later so they'll use that
[02:09:17.400 --> 02:09:22.520]  destabilization to take more liberties take more freedoms well i think clearly that is the case
[02:09:22.520 --> 02:09:31.000]  now the white house is coming out saying that trump's remarks disqualify him now folks regardless
[02:09:31.000 --> 02:09:38.120]  what you think of trump they are after him and they're after him because behind the scenes they
[02:09:38.120 --> 02:09:45.560]  more and more think he is for real now i've got to watch him post i've got others calling me up
[02:09:45.560 --> 02:09:50.280]  saying talk to us about your behind the scenes dealings with trump well there aren't many and
[02:09:50.280 --> 02:09:58.360]  no i'm not going to talk to you about them but the point is this country is being systematically
[02:09:58.360 --> 02:10:04.360]  dismantled and everybody wants to be friends with the media everybody wants to act genteel
[02:10:05.000 --> 02:10:10.680]  and and and act all friendly while the media attacks you the answer is slapping the collaborator
[02:10:10.680 --> 02:10:21.160]  media around disrespecting them openly declaring them the enemies of this country and now senator
[02:10:21.160 --> 02:10:28.280]  paul has come out and said that he disqualifies his plans as a religious star for muslims well
[02:10:28.280 --> 02:10:34.120]  that's because he's beating the other candidates so bad i'd imagine they want to be qualified
[02:10:34.120 --> 02:10:39.560]  of for his free speech that's kind of what we're hearing from the from the attorney general two
[02:10:39.560 --> 02:10:44.040]  days ago she said we'll basically arrest you if we think your speech could spurs might a violence
[02:10:45.880 --> 02:10:51.800]  and so what's happening is they're all lining up against trump because they realize that he
[02:10:51.800 --> 02:10:56.040]  isn't going to play ball now i don't know joel scalzen's take on that we'll see if he agrees
[02:10:56.040 --> 02:11:01.720]  or disagrees or what his view is of it but here's what i do know you know what's outrageous you know
[02:11:01.720 --> 02:11:06.360]  what's fascist is having open borders and not vetting people and then taking our rights and
[02:11:06.360 --> 02:11:12.200]  having the irs pass a bill ron paul wrote about this yesterday to make you not be able to fly out
[02:11:12.200 --> 02:11:17.160]  of the country if they say you owe back taxes no judge no jury they just put you on a no leave the
[02:11:17.160 --> 02:11:21.560]  country list and obama says we'll put you on a no gun buy list if you're on a no fly list that's
[02:11:21.560 --> 02:11:30.200]  also extra judiciary and is the very fount the very fountain the very source of classical tyranny
[02:11:30.200 --> 02:11:39.000]  to just be disappeared us supreme court gives nod to assault weapons ban oh cities can just ban
[02:11:39.000 --> 02:11:47.560]  your guns now if they want huge anti-gun ruling by the blackmailed court so here we are ladies and
[02:11:47.560 --> 02:11:55.640]  gentlemen here we are and it's clear the globalist are moving at an accelerated pace they're having
[02:11:55.640 --> 02:11:59.800]  some defeats they're also having some victories the russians going into syria through a lot of stuff
[02:11:59.800 --> 02:12:08.360]  geopolitically into a disarray but domestically it's dangerous um there are some suspicious things
[02:12:08.360 --> 02:12:12.280]  that have gone on out in california bare minimum government at the highest levels let these people
[02:12:12.280 --> 02:12:20.840]  in let her in let her use fake information and old trump saying you see you can't not have people
[02:12:20.840 --> 02:12:25.480]  be vetted and then just brought in it's got to stop for a limited time till it's fixed that's putting
[02:12:25.480 --> 02:12:30.760]  pressure on them to not let these people in the big outrage is how are they bringing them in by the
[02:12:30.760 --> 02:12:36.360]  millions to europe the carjack and rape and murder and now it's happening here these folks have been
[02:12:36.360 --> 02:12:42.360]  wound up in qatar and saudi arabia and iraq as sunni will hobbyists hate us these are the radical
[02:12:42.360 --> 02:12:48.360]  crazy eyes these are the dangerous group that kill christians and non radical muslim minorities
[02:12:49.240 --> 02:12:53.160]  and i've assessed them i've studied them that this is the foaming at the mouth crazy people
[02:12:53.160 --> 02:12:59.160]  not all of them but this is the group they come from military age men confirmed on facebook to be
[02:12:59.160 --> 02:13:03.560]  soldiers of isis coming into europe in the u.s because they pose with their weapons on their
[02:13:03.560 --> 02:13:09.480]  same facebook and then say now i'm in iraq now i'm in syria now i'm in turkey now i'm in germany
[02:13:09.480 --> 02:13:15.080]  now i'm in the united states how will the political class when these groups start shooting down jet
[02:13:15.080 --> 02:13:19.880]  airliners with stinger missiles they were given by our government spin that how will they spin them
[02:13:19.880 --> 02:13:25.240]  when they shoot up the next school or the next mall jules calzam is a former marine corps fighter
[02:13:25.240 --> 02:13:33.720]  pilot from the vietnam era author researcher probably the top uh safe home uh writer one of the
[02:13:33.720 --> 02:13:39.320]  top preppers in the country we sell his book and also produce the film strategic relocation
[02:13:39.320 --> 02:13:45.080]  available at info wars store dot com an absolute christmas gift uh he is the editor in chief of
[02:13:45.080 --> 02:13:51.240]  world affairs brief dot com and and joel i don't know where to begin here but clearly
[02:13:52.200 --> 02:13:56.920]  the climate politically across the board is heating up worldwide let's take the trump
[02:13:56.920 --> 02:14:02.280]  thing first and then other subjects you can cover in order that you choose but am i wrong
[02:14:02.280 --> 02:14:08.840]  about trump what nuance can you add where is this going well trump is certainly uh you know taking a
[02:14:08.840 --> 02:14:15.080]  a typically a correct position but an uncareful position in other words it's spoken in a way
[02:14:15.080 --> 02:14:20.600]  that is just uh giving the media a day and every one of the other anti-trump candidates in the
[02:14:20.600 --> 02:14:26.840]  republic and primary if he just says outright ban which is what it appeared initially uh you know
[02:14:26.840 --> 02:14:32.440]  all muslims coming into the country obviously that's you know going a little too far if he's
[02:14:32.440 --> 02:14:38.120]  saying ban them until you have a proper vetting process then that's every bit every bit correct
[02:14:38.120 --> 02:14:45.080]  um it's impossible however for to trust our government to run the vetting process because
[02:14:45.080 --> 02:14:50.600]  obviously they created isis uh if they wanted to have a lot of isis people come in they would
[02:14:50.600 --> 02:14:56.040]  certainly let them and say that they were vetted and they're not going to they're not going to do
[02:14:56.040 --> 02:15:01.480]  that now relative i have a little bit different take relative to the number of people uh young
[02:15:01.480 --> 02:15:07.720]  muslim military age people coming in my sources tell me uh in interviewing a lot of these people
[02:15:07.720 --> 02:15:12.440]  in europe and in the middle east these are conscription age military people i'm not saying
[02:15:12.440 --> 02:15:17.720]  by the way by the what's wrong there is proof that some of these people who have been jihadists are
[02:15:17.720 --> 02:15:23.880]  in the group but the majority it appears are people running away from conscription running away
[02:15:23.880 --> 02:15:31.640]  from having to be forced into the military as terrorists uh in any number of the dozen uh
[02:15:31.640 --> 02:15:36.600]  you know jihadist groups in there and they they really aren't particularly religious in fact a
[02:15:36.600 --> 02:15:41.960]  lot of them are running away from muslim uh or from islam that's why they get so deeply involved
[02:15:41.960 --> 02:15:46.680]  in the pornography and the other corruptive things of the west once they get there that's why they
[02:15:46.680 --> 02:15:53.240]  get involved with rape these people are simply young men who don't want to fight who don't
[02:15:53.240 --> 02:15:59.960]  are tired of the and want uh you know the the good life uh in in the western countries although they
[02:15:59.960 --> 02:16:05.160]  do hate the united states everyone in the middle east has been trained to hate the united states
[02:16:05.160 --> 02:16:10.200]  because of our constant intervention there you know everybody in the world knows about the
[02:16:10.200 --> 02:16:16.520]  relationship between turkey and isis uh and the united states backing turkey and and covering for
[02:16:16.520 --> 02:16:21.640]  turkey's uh collaboration with isis and that's because obviously turkey's taking orders from
[02:16:22.280 --> 02:16:30.120]  the united states in in uh you know facilitating the sale of isis oil everybody in in europe in
[02:16:30.120 --> 02:16:35.080]  the middle east knows about the 9 11 controversy that it was the government operation from beginning
[02:16:35.080 --> 02:16:42.360]  to end it's only the united states people who are continued you know to believe that the official
[02:16:42.360 --> 02:16:48.680]  version and that's only about 60 of the us people believe the official versions i think some 40 don't
[02:16:48.680 --> 02:16:53.480]  believe it though they don't understand how bad it really is it takes a lot of study as you know
[02:16:54.200 --> 02:16:57.880]  to understand the nuances of what happened in 9 11 how the us pulled that off
[02:16:57.880 --> 02:17:05.800]  jose calzen i totally agree with what you just said but you make the statement us pulled it off and
[02:17:05.800 --> 02:17:13.000]  in a way that's true but again semantically criminal elements and networks compartmentalized
[02:17:13.000 --> 02:17:18.040]  did because that's what the media does they then say that we say the us government did it but i
[02:17:18.040 --> 02:17:23.640]  guess it was so high level and so widespread you could argue either way can you elaborate on that
[02:17:23.640 --> 02:17:30.520]  yeah when you look at the cover-up of 9 11 it goes to the highest levels of government now that
[02:17:30.520 --> 02:17:35.080]  isn't to say that george w bush knew a lot about what's going on i think he knew that an operation
[02:17:35.080 --> 02:17:40.040]  was coming down but this is a puppet sitting at the head isn't making the operations wasn't making
[02:17:40.040 --> 02:17:44.840]  the operate just following orders you stay and talk to the students at this elementary school
[02:17:44.840 --> 02:17:49.560]  but dick cheney of course was fully knowledgeable here he is sitting in the white house situation
[02:17:49.560 --> 02:17:56.360]  room allowing the airliner coming in to attack the pentagon i mean this he had to be fully a
[02:17:56.360 --> 02:18:01.000]  hundred percent cognizant that this was a us black operation the young air force officers
[02:18:01.000 --> 02:18:05.800]  are crying out to you know this airplane is 10 miles out do the orders still stand and he's
[02:18:05.800 --> 02:18:11.720]  panicking because the orders have to be let it come in don't stop it don't shoot this airline
[02:18:11.720 --> 02:18:16.440]  down and he's getting panicky and you know dick cheney whips his head around instead of course
[02:18:16.440 --> 02:18:23.080]  the orders still stand and of course you know as glenn greenwood pointed out the united states
[02:18:23.640 --> 02:18:31.240]  just honored cheney with a bust of his head in the u.s congressional building this man should
[02:18:31.240 --> 02:18:36.200]  be tried for war crimes as well as treason against the united states but it clearly was a government
[02:18:36.200 --> 02:18:40.680]  operation from beginning to including the hiring of the terrorists i mean that's why they don't show
[02:18:40.680 --> 02:18:45.800]  the videos of the terrorists and the passengers getting on the airplane of the hijack they
[02:18:45.800 --> 02:18:52.360]  refuse to show the videos because it would show that the named hijackers weren't the ones getting
[02:18:52.360 --> 02:18:57.160]  on the airplane there was another set of hijackers that they had trained in saudi arabia i believe
[02:18:57.160 --> 02:19:02.520]  on major airliners because there's a pilot i can tell you you can't train on sesna and even know
[02:19:02.520 --> 02:19:08.280]  how to turn off the autopilot of one of those major jets impossible and so there's no way that
[02:19:08.280 --> 02:19:13.240]  those named hijackers is so this is a cover-up from beginning in including the covering of saudi
[02:19:13.240 --> 02:19:21.160]  arabia's and role in training pilots as well as keeping a lot of the phony hijackers on the list
[02:19:21.720 --> 02:19:26.760]  in their apartments we're going to break but let me ask you this quick question is saudi arabia
[02:19:26.760 --> 02:19:33.560]  arguably the most evil country in the world no we are we are i mean they're just puppets to the
[02:19:33.560 --> 02:19:39.160]  united states we're covering for them that makes us culpable for so much of what goes on in the
[02:19:39.160 --> 02:19:45.480]  world where we allow and we you know help saudi arabia we promise to cover their their pedophilia
[02:19:45.480 --> 02:19:50.840]  and i mean these people are not muslims they're just corrupt individuals pretending to be muslims
[02:19:50.840 --> 02:19:54.120]  i agree sir stay right there we're going to come back and get into more geopolitics
[02:19:54.120 --> 02:19:57.560]  but joe scowls and the world affairs brief i'm out with scowls in full wars

[02:22:31.320 --> 02:22:35.960]  when you need to stay warm without smoke like in times of war there may even come a time when you
[02:22:35.960 --> 02:22:42.200]  can't burn fuel the answers may be simpler and less costly than you think for these answers go to

[02:24:09.720 --> 02:24:13.960]  by the way coming up in the next segment i'm going to play the clip again uh from the ap
[02:24:13.960 --> 02:24:19.080]  speech the speech he gave yesterday where the ap just played the clip where he said you know no
[02:24:19.080 --> 02:24:25.720]  more muslims period until we vetted them well they just have him saying no more muslims period
[02:24:25.720 --> 02:24:31.320]  absolute control ban and they take it out of context but i think this will only make trump
[02:24:31.320 --> 02:24:36.760]  go up in the polls because i was somebody who was against the iraq war i was somebody who was
[02:24:36.760 --> 02:24:41.320]  against all this islamophobia i knew they were trying to destabilize the middle east to put
[02:24:41.320 --> 02:24:47.240]  radicals in charge to wreck the place i don't want to just randomly hate brown people or muslims
[02:24:47.240 --> 02:24:52.360]  or arabs i mean people know i've been a champion of of not abusing these countries and these peoples
[02:24:53.160 --> 02:24:57.080]  but now that they're bringing them in now they're bringing in radicals now that this is happening
[02:24:57.080 --> 02:25:01.160]  and jose calzen's right a lot of them are just guys looking for welfare and jobs and women
[02:25:01.800 --> 02:25:05.960]  still doesn't matter they're the cover for the radicals which will then be used to take our
[02:25:05.960 --> 02:25:10.920]  rights and we've been proven that's coming uh but jose calzen this is a short segment long
[02:25:10.920 --> 02:25:16.280]  segment coming up so many other topics so much more to cover what about the question
[02:25:16.280 --> 02:25:20.920]  that paul craig roberts asked is war on the horizon is it too late to stop it what do you make of
[02:25:20.920 --> 02:25:26.920]  urgun threatening to blow up russian ships two days ago and uh what do you make of uh the the
[02:25:27.960 --> 02:25:33.560]  turkish going into iraq and iraq saying it's an act of war and just their arrogance is turkey
[02:25:33.560 --> 02:25:40.840]  doing this at the behest of nato or is turkey out of control or what's your intel well nato
[02:25:40.840 --> 02:25:47.720]  is not actually directing turkey the united states is directly uh getting turkey to do its bidding
[02:25:47.720 --> 02:25:54.360]  remember that the shootdown of the russian su-24 was at the direct instigation of the united states
[02:25:54.360 --> 02:25:58.760]  and i believe they wanted to do it in order to force russia to bring in their top of the line
[02:25:58.760 --> 02:26:03.800]  air defense system so the u.s could eavesdrop on them and see what kind of jamming capabilities
[02:26:03.800 --> 02:26:10.680]  they have s 400 yes the s 400 as well as their air-to-air jamming equipment and their air-to-air
[02:26:10.680 --> 02:26:15.640]  missiles all of which have radar signatures which have to be eavesdrop on us and has hasn't had any
[02:26:15.640 --> 02:26:20.760]  opportunity to get that information here to for because russia hasn't been in combat using those
[02:26:20.760 --> 02:26:27.560]  and hadn't been until they shot down one of the su-24s that forced russia's hand and now russia's
[02:26:27.560 --> 02:26:33.000]  brought in its top of the line fighter planes as well that's correct so i don't one of the
[02:26:33.000 --> 02:26:38.520]  interesting things that happened this week as well is the us for the first time attacked the syrian
[02:26:38.520 --> 02:26:46.120]  army positions in other words this is a major escalate this is a major escalation because
[02:26:46.120 --> 02:26:52.520]  russia is going to be forced perhaps to defend the syrian troops against russian air or us
[02:26:52.520 --> 02:26:58.920]  air attacks they may have to you know turn on their systems which is be enough usually to get
[02:26:58.920 --> 02:27:05.240]  the u.s aircraft to turn around if you get locked on by an s 400 missile that's you know typically
[02:27:05.240 --> 02:27:11.720]  you turn tail and run that coupled with turkey publishing this photo of the russian crew member
[02:27:11.720 --> 02:27:17.240]  supposedly holding a rocket launcher now i want to say something's wrong with that that looks like
[02:27:17.240 --> 02:27:23.000]  a provocation from turkey because those ships passing through the bosporus are a mile to two
[02:27:23.000 --> 02:27:29.320]  miles away from shore can't see it you can't see that the pictures that they've showed at the russian
[02:27:29.320 --> 02:27:38.440]  ships don't have that type of structure that shows up in the picture in other words that either
[02:27:38.440 --> 02:27:44.200]  was photoshopped or that was from a different time or frame i'm surprised surprised that the
[02:27:44.200 --> 02:27:50.360]  russians haven't come out and uh and debunked that particular picture because it obviously is
[02:27:50.360 --> 02:27:55.560]  very very fraudulent or something that you know they picked out of some other time well turkey
[02:27:55.560 --> 02:27:59.240]  threatened to blow up their ships already i wouldn't i wouldn't be surprised if they weren't aiming but
[02:27:59.240 --> 02:28:04.600]  it wouldn't be shoulder fired would it be a larger onboard missile you're talking about a mile or two
[02:28:04.600 --> 02:28:10.280]  away you don't use a shoulder fired uh you know bazooka type uh you know cannon to do that you've
[02:28:10.280 --> 02:28:16.200]  got all kinds of weapons on ships to do those types of things so this there's something wrong with
[02:28:16.200 --> 02:28:23.560]  that story uh either it means that the us is trying to provoke additional reactions but because
[02:28:23.560 --> 02:28:28.200]  it and i disagree with paul craig robbers i don't think this is meant to provoke world war
[02:28:28.200 --> 02:28:33.560]  three years i pointed out on sunday on your show the us isn't going to gain anything in terms of
[02:28:33.560 --> 02:28:39.640]  getting the world to join a militarized global government by by creating a uh a conventional
[02:28:39.640 --> 02:28:45.480]  war with russia uh it just doesn't do it uh the us is sitting there managing a convention where
[02:28:45.480 --> 02:28:50.040]  everyone's sitting on the sideline cheering the us on and say yeah go to it but you see
[02:28:50.040 --> 02:28:56.280]  the us really wants to set us up for a nuclear confrontation with russia and china where our
[02:28:56.280 --> 02:29:02.520]  military gets taken down that and that alone is what drives people into accepting their solution
[02:29:02.520 --> 02:29:07.560]  that we need a military global government to fight this war because the us has been decapitated

[02:33:22.920 --> 02:33:27.800]  something that i should point out a lot more white house run media matters memos got leaked
[02:33:27.800 --> 02:33:33.400]  five years ago where they said all independent libertarian patriot based media will needs to
[02:33:33.400 --> 02:33:39.960]  be infiltrated and destroyed i want to explain to you separately we have been partially infiltrated
[02:33:39.960 --> 02:33:44.760]  before like a movie i mean i get followed around home sometimes you name it i'm not going to get
[02:33:44.760 --> 02:33:49.880]  into it all but it's like a movie can you imagine what it's like for other people this is real
[02:33:51.480 --> 02:33:58.120]  okay and you need to understand we're having a big effect they don't like us i like to have lots
[02:33:58.120 --> 02:34:01.720]  of company in this fight that's why i have all these other great guests on there doing just as
[02:34:01.720 --> 02:34:07.240]  good a job as i am or better but you have the real power you are why they're scared of info wars
[02:34:07.800 --> 02:34:12.920]  because we have millions and millions and millions and millions and millions of viewers
[02:34:12.920 --> 02:34:20.920]  and listeners and again when you've got billions of views on youtube when you've got this weekend i
[02:34:20.920 --> 02:34:28.200]  shot three videos together they had over two million no two and a half million views those were live
[02:34:28.200 --> 02:34:35.320]  unedited where instantly there's 50 000 watching within a minute and then when by the end of the
[02:34:35.320 --> 02:34:42.760]  video there's 100 000 watching and then 300 400 500 600 700 800 in one video had 1.3 million views
[02:34:42.760 --> 02:34:48.040]  within a day now do you think the establishment likes that no they are scared to death because
[02:34:48.040 --> 02:34:53.240]  it's not a fat lady on a treadmill getting that many videos it's not cats playing it's not french
[02:34:53.240 --> 02:35:00.920]  bulldogs it's not jz it's alex jones it's people like jules calzone let me tell you when we have a
[02:35:00.920 --> 02:35:07.560]  video our average video gets about 50 000 views we put out about 40 videos a day 40 50 000 people
[02:35:07.560 --> 02:35:15.000]  watching a political video is a victory so i'm not bragging i'm saying this i can feel the wings of
[02:35:15.000 --> 02:35:20.120]  doom flapping around spiritually i mean i know i'm in danger and i'm just asking for your prayers
[02:35:20.120 --> 02:35:24.040]  your support but also prayers for other people that are taking action because
[02:35:25.160 --> 02:35:28.760]  they've once said there are no atheists and foxholes i forget who said that but let me tell you
[02:35:28.760 --> 02:35:34.680]  there aren't this stuff is real you can see it and as it all gets announced as world government
[02:35:34.680 --> 02:35:38.520]  gets announced as all this evil comes out in the open the next few years what do you think is
[02:35:38.520 --> 02:35:42.680]  going to happen to the credibility of a world affairs brief or world net daily a drugs report
[02:35:42.680 --> 02:35:48.680]  dot com and info wars and the hundreds of other sites that aren't as big or effective i wish they
[02:35:48.680 --> 02:35:53.640]  were believing i want to be able to have so many patriot leaders out there that they can't
[02:35:53.640 --> 02:36:00.680]  decapitate us all it it's like walking point in a dmz you know up on the edge of a demilitarized
[02:36:00.680 --> 02:36:04.840]  zone with the north koreans on the other side taking potshots at you i do not like being up front
[02:36:04.840 --> 02:36:11.960]  but it's my duty my job and so i want to go 110 i want to have the full effect i'm not on this

[02:36:44.920 --> 02:36:51.240]  just because people think it's special to put something really good out only an idiot would
[02:36:51.240 --> 02:36:55.080]  not put something really good out you want to dominate a market but plus i am a good guy
[02:36:55.080 --> 02:37:02.120]  the point is is that we are accelerating at a rapid pace our numbers i mean we have doubled
[02:37:02.120 --> 02:37:06.440]  the audience the last year conservatively in fact it's way more than that it scares me quite
[02:37:06.440 --> 02:37:12.280]  frankly it's like being strapped to a rocket and that's because evil's rising whatever's opposing
[02:37:12.280 --> 02:37:17.800]  it is going to rise as well it's time for you to rise and i know all of you don't see
[02:37:17.800 --> 02:37:22.120]  yourselves as leaders then pass the info on but if you do have a burning desire to take action
[02:37:22.680 --> 02:37:27.640]  get involved start a show go on access tv go speak at city council get involved is all i'm

[02:37:51.080 --> 02:37:55.000]  would be our number one best seller it's a real sleeper though i never really promoted it and it's
[02:37:55.000 --> 02:38:00.280]  the hottest item we've got because it turns out the vitamin and mineral nerds i mean that nicely
[02:38:00.280 --> 02:38:05.880]  the experts just salivate over this formula it's such a game changer it's proprietary group only
[02:38:05.880 --> 02:38:14.920]  develop this for us so infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139 it'll probably sell out in the next few weeks

[02:38:34.120 --> 02:38:38.760]  for your support your prayers and more uh Joel Scowsen thanks for coming on while i rant i want
[02:38:38.760 --> 02:38:45.080]  to finish up on the unprecedented nature of the provocations by the west i wanted to then move
[02:38:45.080 --> 02:38:51.080]  into more on trump briefly and then back into other issues but speaking specifically about the
[02:38:51.080 --> 02:38:57.720]  liberty movement i don't actually see how the establishment i guess they'll just demonize us
[02:38:57.720 --> 02:39:04.760]  but i mean the liberty movement is becoming the cause celebs super popular super hot across the
[02:39:04.760 --> 02:39:10.040]  board worldwide i don't see how the globalist the anglo-american establishment can continue to
[02:39:10.040 --> 02:39:15.400]  execute their operations if our growth curve is this fast i think that's why they're announcing
[02:39:15.400 --> 02:39:20.760]  censorship and other algorithms to begin next year can you elaborate on that or agree or disagree
[02:39:20.760 --> 02:39:28.440]  well i agree that they're they're beefing up on a lot of fronts i don't think they're going to be
[02:39:28.440 --> 02:39:35.640]  able to do to do that however i think there's a difference between throwing the ideas out there
[02:39:35.640 --> 02:39:42.520]  prepping the public maybe perhaps getting a little more acceptance of them but they can't even get
[02:39:42.520 --> 02:39:47.160]  i mean despite the new york times coming up for gun control huffington post coming out for absolute
[02:39:47.160 --> 02:39:52.680]  confiscation of all guns it's not going to happen there's just too much opposition to it right now
[02:39:53.400 --> 02:39:59.560]  but the pressure is building so that when they have a big enough crisis and god only knows they're
[02:39:59.560 --> 02:40:04.840]  going to throw a continual mass shooting at us one day after or one week after another it seems
[02:40:04.840 --> 02:40:11.480]  until they get something but politicians know they're going to get unelected if they do another
[02:40:11.480 --> 02:40:16.920]  assault weapons ban at a national level that's why it's important that the supreme court took
[02:40:16.920 --> 02:40:21.720]  a role in saying and in heller in that case affirming the individual right to the second
[02:40:21.720 --> 02:40:25.880]  amendment it's very telling that they said but state local governments can put reasonable
[02:40:25.880 --> 02:40:31.560]  restrictions and now after opening the door to state and local governments to actually confiscate
[02:40:31.560 --> 02:40:37.560]  or ban total weapons they refuse to take the case about whether or not it's reasonable or not
[02:40:37.560 --> 02:40:44.760]  i mean that clearly shows that the feds one don't have the political capital to do gun confiscation
[02:40:44.760 --> 02:40:50.840]  themselves even the democrats can't get caught great so they're going to depend on the states and
[02:40:50.840 --> 02:40:55.480]  only the most liberal states are going to get away with that but it's a slower voting process
[02:40:56.200 --> 02:41:01.400]  it all points out as you said our movement is growing alex in the large part due to you because
[02:41:01.400 --> 02:41:06.200]  you're the biggest audience out there i mean a great many of the people who come to the world
[02:41:06.200 --> 02:41:10.440]  affairs brief come to it because of you and i'm very appreciative of that and so are other people
[02:41:10.440 --> 02:41:19.800]  uh but it goes to the point that their solution to us is twofold one politically they want to
[02:41:19.800 --> 02:41:25.960]  give us a compromised republican to make us all go to sleep and to the credit fortunately if the
[02:41:25.960 --> 02:41:31.000]  establish or the conservative movement now they're not buying it it's almost like anything that the
[02:41:31.000 --> 02:41:36.600]  media puts forward everyone says it must be wrong we've learned our lessons were all the betrayals
[02:41:36.600 --> 02:41:41.160]  before i was about to say aren't you and and so many others us together because you've run some of
[02:41:41.160 --> 02:41:45.560]  the major conservative organizations in the country trying to make the republican party do its job
[02:41:45.560 --> 02:41:50.920]  decades ago so it didn't come to fruition then but it's coming later thanks to you and ron paul and
[02:41:50.920 --> 02:41:54.200]  many others and we're not just here to give credit we're trying to point out to listeners
[02:41:54.200 --> 02:41:59.640]  we're having an effect things just don't happen overnight that aren't we successfully radicalizing
[02:41:59.640 --> 02:42:05.800]  the mainline republican party i mean as rachel madow says yes because we've we've produced one
[02:42:07.640 --> 02:42:12.600]  essay after another on betrayal it's been betrayal and betrayal and the message has finally gotten
[02:42:12.600 --> 02:42:17.560]  home you can't trust anybody who gets to be speaker of the house even paul ryan they've thrown out
[02:42:17.560 --> 02:42:22.840]  at us assuming conservative but he's not going to be conservative anybody the establishment
[02:42:22.840 --> 02:42:28.920]  allows to be in that position we know is not going to do what we want to be done what it's
[02:42:28.920 --> 02:42:34.040]  right for the country in accordance with the constitution anybody who's allowed to be elected
[02:42:34.040 --> 02:42:39.000]  president isn't going to do the job even donald trump i mean we talked about trump he's taking
[02:42:39.000 --> 02:42:44.040]  the correct positions i'm still a little nervous alex because of the bad positions he's taken
[02:42:44.760 --> 02:42:50.280]  and the no i hear you i hear you it's just and i feel like i'm evil if i kind of sit on the sideline
[02:42:50.280 --> 02:42:55.560]  and let hillary get in i get physically nauseous joel yeah absolutely uh you know we have to have
[02:42:55.560 --> 02:43:01.000]  have take a position for a principled position and right now donald trump is taking the only
[02:43:01.000 --> 02:43:05.000]  position that is absolutely against the establishment hands down he's just saying
[02:43:05.000 --> 02:43:10.120]  everything the establishment does is wrong we agree with that the trouble is we can't depend
[02:43:10.120 --> 02:43:16.840]  on him i think what if he were to get an office to do completely what's right these types of
[02:43:16.840 --> 02:43:23.880]  things that he suggests will get him crucified i think he would be subject to an assassination
[02:43:23.880 --> 02:43:28.440]  attempt to be got in well the secret service does think that they've they've got him under constant
[02:43:28.440 --> 02:43:36.120]  guard yes they do so but i still believe as i pointed out in this week's world affairs brief
[02:43:36.120 --> 02:43:42.840]  they began to pull out the john mccain strategy on chris christie this week a major new hampshire
[02:43:42.840 --> 02:43:48.920]  newspaper uh came out the major newspaper there came out and endorsed chris christie this is what
[02:43:48.920 --> 02:43:56.040]  they did to raise john mccain out of nothing status in 2008 to gain the presidency i think they
[02:43:56.040 --> 02:44:01.560]  decided that bush just isn't going to make it he's not that exciting christie is a powerful
[02:44:01.560 --> 02:44:06.920]  speaker he is capable of lying to a great extent he is totally establishment a lot of skeletons
[02:44:06.920 --> 02:44:12.680]  in his closet the mere fact that they are pushing to get christie to win in new hampshire means this
[02:44:12.680 --> 02:44:20.040]  may be their newest tactic rubio is a little bit too young and cherubic he doesn't have the gravitas
[02:44:20.040 --> 02:44:26.840]  that is necessary i think to engender uh you know nationwide support chris christie could
[02:44:26.840 --> 02:44:31.800]  probably do it i don't trust him as far as i could throw him but i'm just sending out a warning it
[02:44:31.800 --> 02:44:37.800]  looks like that's where the new major establishment push is to overthrow trump to try to get a win in
[02:44:37.800 --> 02:44:43.560]  the new hampshire primary through this kind of endorsement what do you think of ted cruise well
[02:44:43.560 --> 02:44:49.640]  ted cruise is a solid conservative from way back from teenager years there's no one who can deny his
[02:44:49.640 --> 02:44:58.040]  his background but that said he's showing a lot of signs that he uh admires the compromising that
[02:44:58.040 --> 02:45:02.200]  ronald reagan did that's why i went to washington originally his chairman of conservative national
[02:45:02.200 --> 02:45:08.840]  committee was to try to stop the reagan compromises i think reagan also was a true conservative down
[02:45:08.840 --> 02:45:15.080]  deep inside but when you want to be popular when you want to be president too badly as mit romney
[02:45:15.080 --> 02:45:20.200]  did you're going to bend over backwards to please as far as you can and you're going to do a lot of
[02:45:20.200 --> 02:45:25.240]  damage because you're going to convince conservatives that it is correct now i think ted cruise is
[02:45:25.240 --> 02:45:32.760]  a major problem with us as conservatives he's totally bought into the attack syria the war agenda
[02:45:32.760 --> 02:45:39.560]  he is not a neocon in terms of he's not a globalist but like romney took all of those positions
[02:45:39.560 --> 02:45:43.960]  because he thought this is something i can get ahead with conservatives i was about to say romney
[02:45:43.960 --> 02:45:48.120]  why didn't he get back in i mean obviously he would be a major contender right now or they just
[02:45:48.120 --> 02:45:57.240]  threatened him it's a complex complicated story they threaten him so badly before about not running
[02:45:57.240 --> 02:46:03.400]  in he's reluctant to get back in but remember they don't really want anyone in the white house
[02:46:03.400 --> 02:46:08.680]  romney included especially romney who they don't have dirt on they've got to have control of that
[02:46:08.680 --> 02:46:13.560]  president so they can twist his arm as necessary they he has not been faithful to unfaithful to his
[02:46:13.560 --> 02:46:19.000]  wife and uh you know they can't afford to have somebody in there if romney i'll tell you despite
[02:46:19.000 --> 02:46:24.680]  his compromises if he'd seen the bengasi stand on down order going down he would have stopped it
[02:46:26.120 --> 02:46:32.760]  and they can't afford to have that they uh so i don't think they pushed really hard to undo they
[02:46:32.760 --> 02:46:37.640]  didn't certainly go to him say all the threats don't mean anything you can feel free to run run now
[02:46:37.640 --> 02:46:42.200]  they don't gain anything by bringing romney and they've got to have a controlled republican
[02:46:42.200 --> 02:46:48.760]  who will do their bidding especially in the hard cases i think the next republican that they intend
[02:46:48.760 --> 02:46:54.040]  could well take us into a war three and they that's one of the reasons they need a republican
[02:46:54.040 --> 02:47:00.280]  because republicans and best create the atmosphere for a war or at least talk conservatives into a
[02:47:00.280 --> 02:47:06.280]  war well trump they're gonna love trump saying he's a militarist i mean trump yeah really just
[02:47:06.280 --> 02:47:10.600]  does say whatever's coming off the top of his mind i think that scares him at one level because they
[02:47:10.600 --> 02:47:16.840]  know that uh he'd be hard to you know control but i tell you it's a real wild card it is a it is a
[02:47:16.840 --> 02:47:22.840]  real wild card on so many fronts speaking of trump here's a minute 10 compilation put together by rob
[02:47:22.840 --> 02:47:28.200]  dude buckley hamlin and rob jacobson on what trump basically really said and now what's been spun out
[02:47:28.200 --> 02:47:35.720]  of it here's that clip donald j trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of muslims entering
[02:47:35.720 --> 02:47:45.880]  the united states until our country's representatives can figure out what the hell is going on i'm a
[02:47:45.880 --> 02:47:51.320]  proud muslim but you don't have to share my faith to share my disgust that was written by hillary
[02:47:51.320 --> 02:47:56.040]  clinton's right-hand woman huma abedin who pinned the email in response to donald trump's recent
[02:47:56.040 --> 02:48:00.680]  proposition to impose a complete and total shutdown of muslims entering the united states
[02:48:00.680 --> 02:48:04.600]  you know it was the fbi director the head of counterterrorism and homeland security who all
[02:48:04.600 --> 02:48:10.440]  said under oath that they cannot properly vet people coming in from syria this is not a mission
[02:48:10.440 --> 02:48:17.960]  accomplished speech we can and should do more to best enforce the security of our borders the
[02:48:17.960 --> 02:48:23.240]  challenge we're all talking about is that we can only query against that which we have collected
[02:48:23.960 --> 02:48:30.280]  and and so if someone has never made a ripple in the pond in syria in a way that would get their
[02:48:30.280 --> 02:48:34.920]  identity or their interests reflected in our database we can query our database until the
[02:48:34.920 --> 02:48:41.720]  cows come home but we're not gonna we nothing show up because we have no record on it the fbi
[02:48:41.720 --> 02:48:48.520]  director has previously said i think about a few years ago that there were uh people from
[02:48:48.520 --> 02:48:55.320]  terrorist countries who were assuming hispanic names and uh learning a few words of spanish
[02:48:55.320 --> 02:49:01.880]  and coming in the fbi director himself testified to that before congress so we know that this
[02:49:01.880 --> 02:49:07.960]  kind of thing has been going on but let's take a look at miss abedin back in 2012 five republicans
[02:49:07.960 --> 02:49:11.880]  sent a letter to the department of homeland security noting that three of her family members
[02:49:11.880 --> 02:49:16.840]  had very close ties to the muslim brotherhood she was also intimately involved in hillary clinton's
[02:49:16.840 --> 02:49:21.240]  email scandal and while she was at the state department miss abedin helped our country cozy
[02:49:21.240 --> 02:49:26.680]  up to chic yusuf al-qawardi a promoter of jihadist terror and one of her many accomplishments while
[02:49:26.680 --> 02:49:31.240]  at the state department was helping destroy the country of libya i'm sure her and her muslim brotherhood
[02:49:31.240 --> 02:49:35.720]  friends are very proud of that achievement just imagine what she can do in her best pal hillary
[02:49:35.720 --> 02:49:40.920]  clinton gets into the white house rob do reporting for info wars dot com yeah when they get the same
[02:49:40.920 --> 02:49:48.760]  hotel room maybe uh joel scousen is our guest going to break here in just a moment um speaking
[02:49:48.760 --> 02:49:53.320]  of hillary clinton what do you think her chances are for the white house uh i don't think they're
[02:49:53.320 --> 02:49:58.600]  high at all alex uh in the establishment knows it she's not popular with the left that's why
[02:49:58.600 --> 02:50:03.960]  they're going after bernie sanders uh she's got a skeletons a mile long in her closet and of course
[02:50:03.960 --> 02:50:09.880]  they are protecting her in that regard uh but she's got a lot of counter that she could dirt she
[02:50:09.880 --> 02:50:14.040]  could tell about the establishment if they betray her and so they're not going to do that and yet
[02:50:14.040 --> 02:50:17.880]  i don't think they're going to allow her to be elected as i said they want to give us a controlled
[02:50:17.880 --> 02:50:23.400]  republican let me just say before we go to break i didn't finish my thought on putin this week he
[02:50:23.400 --> 02:50:29.960]  gave every indication alex that he is not going to rise to uh turkey's provocations he even announced
[02:50:29.960 --> 02:50:35.640]  today no additional sanctions to turkey over the threats in the bosporus so the west is not going
[02:50:35.640 --> 02:50:40.600]  to be able to get him to come up to a conventional war with the west specifically because he's not
[02:50:40.600 --> 02:50:46.520]  ready and doesn't want to show as much as he of his possible of his capabilities as he has to
[02:50:46.520 --> 02:50:50.840]  well i'm skipping this one break this is so important so continue on the russia situation
[02:50:50.840 --> 02:50:56.440]  russia is being very restrained extremely restrained and the you know they're in the major
[02:50:56.440 --> 02:51:01.560]  in the process of a major building process they need a blue water navy to prosecute a war with
[02:51:01.560 --> 02:51:07.720]  the west uh they need all new weapon systems in production level quantities none of those are coming
[02:51:07.720 --> 02:51:17.720]  online until 2020 21 22 23 and 24 so i can't imagine russia rising to the bait uh of the west
[02:51:17.720 --> 02:51:23.800]  until at least the beginning of the decade and uh so i think we're going to see a lot of posturing
[02:51:23.800 --> 02:51:28.680]  one thing i will say this is really turning into a proxy war between russia in the united states
[02:51:28.680 --> 02:51:35.080]  that's why the u.s is using turkey as the proxy as well as ices and uh you know russia is using
[02:51:35.080 --> 02:51:42.280]  the syrian army the the iranians and hezbollah in syria to execute their strategy but the russians
[02:51:42.280 --> 02:51:50.520]  are running the show now in syria uh very very clearly and doing a lot of damage not only to ices
[02:51:50.520 --> 02:51:56.040]  but mostly of course to the u.s back rebels they love sticking it to the globalist they're really
[02:51:56.040 --> 02:52:03.240]  enjoying this and uh but you can expect either the us or israel to complicate situations such as
[02:52:03.240 --> 02:52:08.520]  u.s attacking syrian forces russia can't allow that to happen they're going to have to uh
[02:52:08.520 --> 02:52:14.520]  it may be that russia the u.s itself is trying to force russia into a confrontation uh over
[02:52:14.520 --> 02:52:19.880]  defending syrian troops and joel joel don't underestimate the recklessness of the anglo-american
[02:52:19.880 --> 02:52:25.080]  establishment i mean they they could actually attack even russian emplacements and say they
[02:52:25.080 --> 02:52:30.280]  didn't know it or deny it i mean it seems like the sky is the limit hopefully that won't happen but
[02:52:30.280 --> 02:52:36.440]  specifically on oil they admit even in mainstream media now but we talked about two three years ago
[02:52:36.440 --> 02:52:41.160]  they want to bankrupt russia with lower oil prices they want to bankrupt u.s producers
[02:52:42.120 --> 02:52:46.760]  they want to push us into the situation because saudi arabia can produce it and export it
[02:52:46.760 --> 02:52:50.680]  cheaper than anybody else with all their sweet reserves for folks that don't know it's basically
[02:52:50.680 --> 02:52:56.120]  gasoline out of the ground don't have to really refine it if you look at all this how can the
[02:52:56.120 --> 02:53:01.720]  american people be informed that our government's siding with saudi arabia to bankrupt our industrial
[02:53:01.720 --> 02:53:06.360]  base i mean they either charge us three hundred dollars four dollars a gallon rip us off or drive
[02:53:06.360 --> 02:53:11.720]  it down and charge us less than they should to create monopolies overall if they want russia
[02:53:11.720 --> 02:53:16.840]  to deploy this new military and attack us someday why would they then be separately putting russia
[02:53:16.840 --> 02:53:23.320]  in a depressionary spiral well that still is a matter of controversy whether or not this is
[02:53:23.320 --> 02:53:29.480]  is deliberate you've got to remember that the source of the oil glut is us fracking here in the
[02:53:29.480 --> 02:53:34.600]  united states and it's the only country where the oil industry is not controlled by the government
[02:53:34.600 --> 02:53:40.600]  they can't shut off the tap in other words they they created and opened up all of this new production
[02:53:40.600 --> 02:53:45.240]  and you just can't shut it out the government cannot tell these private oil companies to stop
[02:53:46.200 --> 02:53:52.920]  so you know if if russia for example was really trying to support the price of oil they would be
[02:53:52.920 --> 02:53:57.080]  cutting production as well and they're not doing it either i think that's a reflection of the fact
[02:53:57.080 --> 02:54:01.960]  that we're hurting just like venezuela can't cut production because they're hurting so much
[02:54:01.960 --> 02:54:06.280]  so i'm not sure this is a deliberate thing to bankrupt russia because you're right that would
[02:54:06.280 --> 02:54:14.200]  go against the globalist agenda of wanting to uh you know stop russian military to increase russian
[02:54:14.200 --> 02:54:19.240]  military production in in favor of this next war in fact i think it's important to remember that even
[02:54:19.240 --> 02:54:26.440]  at the height or the low point of the soviet economy pre-1990 they were still in maximum arms
[02:54:26.440 --> 02:54:33.080]  production so you don't really stop a communist country uh you may stop their free market aspect
[02:54:33.640 --> 02:54:39.240]  by these manipulations or the lower oil prices but you don't stop the fact that they can continue
[02:54:39.240 --> 02:54:44.840]  to print rubles and and pay people sure do you buy the polls that russian approval of putans at an
[02:54:44.840 --> 02:54:51.640]  all-time high absolutely and that's part of the whole process of bringing a strong man back to russia
[02:54:51.640 --> 02:54:55.800]  you know that is you know my feelings the the fall of the soviet union was a carefully crafted
[02:54:55.800 --> 02:54:59.800]  deception the communists are still in charge of putan as their man there's also a new set of
[02:54:59.800 --> 02:55:05.880]  oligarchs that have replaced the original ones they killed off barozovsky and and exiled guzinski
[02:55:05.880 --> 02:55:12.440]  and others uh hordokowski is is under prosecution again in russia but there's a new set of oligarchs
[02:55:12.440 --> 02:55:19.000]  underlying putan and they are still running the communist show uh but part of this process is to
[02:55:19.000 --> 02:55:24.760]  raise up russia nationalism again and remember that russia gains by restraint in the middle east
[02:55:24.760 --> 02:55:30.680]  because they're trying to help the u.s create the image that the u.s is the bully of the world
[02:55:30.680 --> 02:55:35.480]  and so the more russia acts with restraint the more the world feels she would be justified
[02:55:35.480 --> 02:55:41.560]  when she does go after the west someday with nuclear weapons i've asked most of questions
[02:55:41.560 --> 02:55:47.400]  here joel scowls and other things on your radar we haven't gotten to i think one of the things i
[02:55:47.400 --> 02:55:51.880]  want to point out i know you've covered this an awful lot about the uh sam bernie no shootings
[02:55:51.880 --> 02:55:57.960]  but my take on this is is this there was an article in today about who were the shooters
[02:55:58.680 --> 02:56:04.840]  and you know for an organization that just had an interview this week with one of the live witnesses
[02:56:04.840 --> 02:56:11.080]  saying that these were white guys there were three of them tall muscular i mean these were
[02:56:11.080 --> 02:56:17.880]  obviously mercenaries that were in there doing the shooting farah sayed faruk is not tall neither
[02:56:17.880 --> 02:56:23.400]  is his wife there's no way that they could have mistaken them i don't believe that faruk and malik
[02:56:23.400 --> 02:56:29.240]  were in fact doing the shooting i think they were part of it just like the two arrestees and the
[02:56:29.240 --> 02:56:34.520]  marathon bombing but they're meant to take the entire rap to shield the mercenaries that were
[02:56:34.520 --> 02:56:39.240]  in there doing the shooting and this is the same thing in the paris attack you know there was this
[02:56:39.240 --> 02:56:44.280]  Mercedes driving from restaurant to restaurant witnesses said they were white guys they were
[02:56:44.280 --> 02:56:50.200]  tall strong and muscular they were not muslims and yet the media and this is a key to a conspiracy
[02:56:50.200 --> 02:56:54.840]  the media and the french government never put out that they were looking for a black Mercedes
[02:56:54.840 --> 02:57:00.680]  they never put out any description from these witnesses they simply buried it cnn has never
[02:57:00.680 --> 02:57:04.920]  ever mentioned that's witness that key witness by the way we have one white lady that was very
[02:57:04.920 --> 02:57:09.480]  clear about three white men and then a separate black guy on another tv station saying you saw
[02:57:09.480 --> 02:57:14.440]  the exact same thing live that day that's pretty credible and it's two different groups and there's
[02:57:14.440 --> 02:57:20.520]  a drill going on down the street at the exact same time well you know i discount the drill aspects
[02:57:20.520 --> 02:57:25.640]  of these and including in the paris attacks the drill was important in 9 11 because it actually
[02:57:25.640 --> 02:57:33.000]  inhibited a response to 9 11 it had a purpose there the drills in the previous month or two in
[02:57:33.000 --> 02:57:39.080]  San Bernardino didn't have any effect on the military response to that drill so i'm discounting
[02:57:39.080 --> 02:57:45.560]  that but i'll tell you there's something very real when no reporter at all in the mainstream
[02:57:45.560 --> 02:57:50.920]  he never asked the police at any of these news come what about the third suspect and it comes
[02:57:50.920 --> 02:57:56.680]  out that this third suspect that had probably wasn't involved these were just covers for the
[02:57:56.680 --> 02:58:02.440]  fact that they completely let escape the three tall white mercenary males who actually did the
[02:58:02.440 --> 02:58:07.480]  shooting and you they didn't walk or run away i'm sure they went away in a vehicle and the government
[02:58:07.480 --> 02:58:12.680]  isn't you know looking for them so joel stay there stay there i want to come back to five more minutes
[02:58:12.680 --> 02:58:17.400]  i want to ask you this question clearly it's a false five they let them in to begin with and
[02:58:17.400 --> 02:58:22.040]  have opened the doors up but why not stage a false flag where it's white christians or
[02:58:22.040 --> 02:58:26.280]  hispanic christians or something that fits the narrative better why stage a whole false flag
[02:58:26.280 --> 02:58:32.200]  and then have it be at least one person who came here under false pretenses that blows up an obama's
[02:58:32.200 --> 02:58:36.920]  narrative explain that to me i mean i agree the evidence is there it's just well then what's
[02:58:36.920 --> 02:58:43.320]  going on stay with us thank you for listening to info wars.com forward slash show visit gc

[03:00:40.520 --> 03:00:44.040]  he's going to be covering as well jill scowles and you heard my question for folks that just joined us
[03:00:44.040 --> 03:00:49.960]  is why didn't they run a false flag was just white christians or white republicans because
[03:00:49.960 --> 03:00:54.920]  that's the whole narrative i mean i agree you've got the evidence of the shooters you've got all
[03:00:54.920 --> 03:01:01.560]  this other stuff happening why not tailor it or was this done so we would accept it and believe it
[03:01:01.560 --> 03:01:07.000]  and then accept gun control accept more homeland security are they giving us false flags they think
[03:01:07.000 --> 03:01:13.080]  are more appetizing it's a good question the answer is a little bit complex but let me first
[03:01:13.080 --> 03:01:18.440]  of all say that remember that these false flag black operations are going on in preparation
[03:01:18.440 --> 03:01:25.640]  months and months in advance sometimes years in advance and you can't always stop the process or
[03:01:25.640 --> 03:01:31.720]  dovetail or plan on this one i mean i'm sure they've got a dozen or half a dozen uh black
[03:01:31.720 --> 03:01:36.520]  operations gun control oriented operations already in the pipeline and they have to wait till the
[03:01:36.520 --> 03:01:41.960]  patsy is ready to do what they're told and get a line they cannot just wait now remember that faruk
[03:01:41.960 --> 03:01:49.000]  and malik they just he just got 26 000 paid into his bank account somebody paid him off to do something
[03:01:49.000 --> 03:01:54.200]  and i think it was to be present at this i think the government came in and put planted those weapons
[03:01:54.200 --> 03:01:59.480]  the pipe bombs were inert by the way that's a sign of false flag uh the fact that he couldn't have
[03:01:59.480 --> 03:02:05.240]  built that toy car remote bomb he had no electronic means that there are other people involved
[03:02:05.240 --> 03:02:10.360]  which they're not looking for so this was clearly a false flag but i think it's important to realize
[03:02:10.360 --> 03:02:16.440]  that they used terrorism was sacrificed in here it's true there's a disadvantage in having in
[03:02:16.440 --> 03:02:22.680]  ginning up an anti-immigrant reaction to this but remember the key aspect was the atf kept saying
[03:02:22.680 --> 03:02:28.600]  this was a legally acquired gun in california the toughest of all gun states this was completely
[03:02:28.600 --> 03:02:34.840]  tailored to make sure that we have to take down that no gun control is safe for assault weapons
[03:02:34.840 --> 03:02:40.840]  we have to ban them we gotta have more that's and more but not only that i think they're saying
[03:02:40.840 --> 03:02:47.480]  that gun laws don't stop it we've got to actually ban assault weapons that's why the new york times
[03:02:47.480 --> 03:02:51.560]  came out for the ban that's why huffington post came out for the actual this is their time to
[03:02:51.560 --> 03:02:57.960]  declare it you see the scripting yeah and so i think there are compromises they do if they continue
[03:02:57.960 --> 03:03:04.360]  to throw white christians at us um you know it looks more like a government operation they're
[03:03:04.360 --> 03:03:08.840]  they're mixing up and i don't think they can absolutely control they've got as i say sure
[03:03:08.840 --> 03:03:14.120]  they're testing too uh when their real season of false flag comes uh what the fish are biting on
[03:03:15.880 --> 03:03:22.600]  exactly yes um now as i say i don't think it's going to come up to gun control i uh you know at
[03:03:22.600 --> 03:03:28.520]  best the next thing they want is registration and we could see i want all assault weapons registered
[03:03:28.520 --> 03:03:34.360]  uh uh but it's not going to get to confiscation i can i can assure everyone well i agree these
[03:03:34.360 --> 03:03:38.040]  people are scientists and everything they do is beta test over and over again you see it getting
[03:03:38.040 --> 03:03:43.240]  more intense but it's beta testing into the future but uh they're just trying to shut down the economy
[03:03:43.240 --> 03:03:49.000]  with obama care and with welfare with all the rest of it to make us dependent uh but certainly
[03:03:49.000 --> 03:03:53.000]  an interesting time watch what's happening with russia and syria that for me is the big hot button
[03:03:53.000 --> 03:03:57.720]  joel scowzen thank you so much you got about 60 seconds left what else is going on over at world
[03:03:57.720 --> 03:04:06.760]  affairs brief right now well let's see uh we are uh doing a lot to cover you know this election
[03:04:06.760 --> 03:04:13.720]  especially how they're trying to take down adult trump without success um and as i said i i'm focusing
[03:04:13.720 --> 03:04:21.160]  a lot on what they're going to do to do as an alternative to bush who isn't going to fly i think
[03:04:21.160 --> 03:04:27.720]  it's going to be very interesting to watch this uh uh primary process because as i've said in the
[03:04:27.720 --> 03:04:33.240]  world affairs brief there's over 1200 delegates in the primary process that come from blue states
[03:04:33.240 --> 03:04:40.120]  that is liberal republican states they outnumber the conservative states the red states uh by about
[03:04:40.120 --> 03:04:47.720]  till 54 to 46 percent of the 1100 delegates for uh red state republicans and that means that they
[03:04:47.720 --> 03:04:53.000]  keep people like uh rubio who could take the florida primary case it who could take the uh
[03:04:54.280 --> 03:04:57.720]  finish this thought and we'll hand the baton to david night you little big brothers and have
[03:04:57.720 --> 03:05:03.720]  comments i'm a proud muslim but you don't have to share my faith to share my disgust that was written
[03:05:03.720 --> 03:05:08.680]  by hillary clinton's right hand woman huma abedin who pinned the email in response to donald trump's
[03:05:08.680 --> 03:05:13.640]  recent proposition to impose a complete and total shutdown of muslims entering the united states
[03:05:13.640 --> 03:05:17.400]  you know it was the fbi director the head of counterterrorism and homeland security who
[03:05:17.400 --> 03:05:22.360]  all said under oath that they cannot properly vet people coming in from syria but let's take a look
[03:05:22.360 --> 03:05:27.320]  at miss abedin back in 2012 five republicans sent a letter to the department of homeland
[03:05:27.320 --> 03:05:32.200]  security noting that three of her family members had very close ties to the muslim brotherhood
[03:05:32.200 --> 03:05:36.760]  she was also intimately involved in hillary clinton's email scandal and while she was at the state
[03:05:36.760 --> 03:05:42.200]  department miss abedin helped our country cozy up to sheik yusef al qawardi a promoter of jihadist
[03:05:42.200 --> 03:05:46.360]  terror and one of her many accomplishments while at the state department was helping destroy the
[03:05:46.360 --> 03:05:51.080]  country of libya i'm sure her and her muslim brotherhood friends are very proud of that achievement
[03:05:51.080 --> 03:05:55.240]  just imagine what she can do in her best pal hillary clinton gets into the white house
[03:05:55.240 --> 03:06:01.800]  rob do reporting for info wars dot com when cells become toxic they die early and aging sets in

[03:08:13.640 --> 03:08:18.120]  try to tell us jones david night is going to be hosting the rest of the hour but a lot of
[03:08:18.120 --> 03:08:21.880]  days we end up overlapping into the fourth hour obviously some days i'll continue to host the
[03:08:21.880 --> 03:08:26.120]  fourth hour uh but david's got a ton of news coming up he'll be commenting on what jones
[03:08:26.120 --> 03:08:33.000]  scowles is discussing here in just a moment as we finish up my part of the transmission
[03:08:33.000 --> 03:08:37.240]  but we're talking about these purple states they're not democrat they're not republican
[03:08:37.240 --> 03:08:43.000]  they're kind of these swing states uh that are partially republican and jones scowles was getting
[03:08:43.000 --> 03:08:48.600]  into that being the key battle for who they end up nominating also a question i have for joel
[03:08:48.600 --> 03:08:53.880]  because i saw it this morning i didn't cover it it was in my stack but we're covering it now
[03:08:54.600 --> 03:08:58.200]  yeah donald trump's thing about we may have to shut down parts of the internet in some places to
[03:08:58.200 --> 03:09:03.560]  stop these people and again that'll be used to say he's an anti-free speech i would ask him next
[03:09:03.560 --> 03:09:08.200]  time he's on uh what do you mean shut down the internet you mean in certain third world war zones
[03:09:08.200 --> 03:09:14.200]  because you know that's a pretty bold statement you know hillary's saying restrict the internet but
[03:09:14.200 --> 03:09:19.960]  she means our speech and she admits she means our speech so very very dangerous uh some of these
[03:09:19.960 --> 03:09:24.600]  statements uh jones scowles and finish up your purple state breakdown well the important thing
[03:09:24.600 --> 03:09:30.120]  to realize is that if a person doesn't get an outright win in eight primaries then it cannot
[03:09:30.120 --> 03:09:38.840]  be nominated for president so you're gonna look to these people who like rubio and casey who might
[03:09:38.840 --> 03:09:43.080]  win in their individual to hand their votes to someone that they want like christie who i think
[03:09:43.080 --> 03:09:48.280]  is going to win a few and that will beef him up enough to be able to be nominated for president
[03:09:48.280 --> 03:09:53.560]  somehow they're going to dump trump i can tell you that he's not going to be the nominee you're
[03:09:53.560 --> 03:09:57.640]  saying they're going to gerrymanders somehow that's right they're going to gerrymanders this thing
[03:09:57.640 --> 03:10:01.880]  and i think it's very important to watch this because i'll tell you the tea party is going to
[03:10:01.880 --> 03:10:06.680]  be outraged when they see this happen they're going to realize boy the system really is rigged
[03:10:06.680 --> 03:10:13.720]  and it doesn't look like and that's when obama would do a new oklahoma city to blame us yes i
[03:10:13.720 --> 03:10:19.240]  want to also mention before we close here that the national front in france just won the latest
[03:10:19.240 --> 03:10:25.720]  regional election they are now almost as big as the other two major parties and this really
[03:10:25.720 --> 03:10:32.280]  has the establishment worried in europe this goes to the thing that i've long predicted is that the
[03:10:32.280 --> 03:10:38.840]  as helmut kohl told the uh master conference in 1997 if you don't do this voluntarily there's
[03:10:38.840 --> 03:10:44.680]  going to be war the only other alternative to the eu's war and so i think what he means of course
[03:10:44.680 --> 03:10:49.800]  is a globalist that we're going to give you a war to force you into a major global government
[03:10:49.800 --> 03:10:54.760]  and although i still think that this is a few years off alex uh it's coming as sure as we're
[03:10:54.760 --> 03:10:58.920]  living here today well the new attorney general that wants to restrict free speech i totally agree
[03:10:58.920 --> 03:11:04.040]  with you jill scousen tipped her hand when she said her biggest fear is retaliatory strikes on
[03:11:04.040 --> 03:11:08.440]  muslims well hey i don't want anything to happen to random innocent muslims as well especially
[03:11:08.440 --> 03:11:12.280]  the ones being preyed on by the wahhabi a star government's been funding that have killed hundreds
[03:11:12.280 --> 03:11:17.560]  of thousands of them in libya and syria but she tips her hand the perfect thing out of this could
[03:11:17.560 --> 03:11:23.160]  be a false flag with a bunch of muslim school kids or something mowed down by some right winger
[03:11:23.160 --> 03:11:28.520]  they're winding up right now or some patsy or maybe they go all the way with a false flag
[03:11:28.520 --> 03:11:34.200]  and then they can come in and come together and take our guns the name of unity i mean i really
[03:11:34.200 --> 03:11:40.680]  see that and i really just feel in the tea leaves looking at all the pieces that we're going into a
[03:11:40.680 --> 03:11:46.760]  false flag to blame the patriots or they could have a giant muslim attack against muslims in europe
[03:11:46.760 --> 03:11:53.160]  to demonize lapin i mean i really in the calculus i see they need that and that would really help them
[03:11:53.160 --> 03:11:56.760]  now maybe if they know we're there watching and folks aren't going to buy it maybe they won't what
[03:11:56.760 --> 03:12:01.480]  do you say jill scousen no i think in fact i wrote about this in the world affairs briefs that
[03:12:01.480 --> 03:12:06.920]  the women in the paris attacks they dropped this passport showing that one of the attackers the
[03:12:06.920 --> 03:12:12.120]  suicide bombers had come in as a refugee and it of course accelerated the anti muslim movement
[03:12:12.120 --> 03:12:16.040]  there and i thought what could they be doing they don't want to do this they want to have more muslims
[03:12:16.040 --> 03:12:22.360]  coming in but in a sense i thought just as you did here they could very well capitalize on an
[03:12:22.360 --> 03:12:28.760]  anti muslim sentiment by then demonizing those in the name of hate speech who hate muslims or
[03:12:28.760 --> 03:12:34.360]  do who attack muslims and they might very well have black operations attack muslims so that they
[03:12:34.360 --> 03:12:40.920]  can make them a protected class so they have multiple ways to run this and they win either way
[03:12:40.920 --> 03:12:46.920]  they're very very devious wow all right jill scousen thank you for all the time world affairs
[03:12:46.920 --> 03:12:52.520]  brief dot com great job over there look forward to speaking to you soon thank you alex i'll tell
[03:12:52.520 --> 03:12:57.320]  you folks trying to figure out the truth is is interesting it's exciting and also gives me a
[03:12:57.320 --> 03:13:02.920]  headache sometimes all i know is i'm sick of looking at hillary clinton and i'm sick of looking at
[03:13:02.920 --> 03:13:10.760]  barack obama and i want trump to be a good guy in ways he says he says such wild stuff it makes me
[03:13:10.760 --> 03:13:16.440]  think he's real then he says wild stuff and it makes me think what's going on and the fact
[03:13:16.440 --> 03:13:23.080]  he's smart enough through people to reach out to us i just here's the bottom line i'm above my
[03:13:23.080 --> 03:13:28.680]  pay grade right now i'm in over my head but then what makes me even more concerned is i've had dinner
[03:13:28.680 --> 03:13:35.400]  with top rocket scientist top former nasa people billionaires top writers top researchers media
[03:13:35.400 --> 03:13:40.680]  heads and i'm just as smart as they are and i'm more informed because my business is immersing
[03:13:40.680 --> 03:13:45.960]  myself four five hours a day when i get off air mainly and at night not so much in the morning
[03:13:45.960 --> 03:13:49.800]  anymore i still do that for about an hour because i study like four hours every morning i don't do
[03:13:49.800 --> 03:13:57.400]  that anymore and i just can't go crazy and it's just so so out of control but that's the answer
[03:13:57.400 --> 03:14:04.360]  create the crisis and then offer world government as the solution to it i want to get comments before
[03:14:04.360 --> 03:14:10.680]  i hand the baton uh from david night who is in the situation room again i'm in the war room as we
[03:14:10.680 --> 03:14:14.920]  call it here in info wars if you're a radio listener don't forget we simulcast full video
[03:14:14.920 --> 03:14:19.080]  from multi studios and with reporters on the ground around the country and the world
[03:14:19.080 --> 03:14:24.440]  at info wars dot com forward slash show we now take you back to david night david what do you
[03:14:24.440 --> 03:14:29.160]  think about what what you heard uh joel scousen and i just talk about well alex i think that
[03:14:29.800 --> 03:14:35.240]  clearly trump's remarks i think will actually make him more popular i'm surprised to see that it
[03:14:35.240 --> 03:14:40.680]  wasn't covered at all by most people we we covered a little bit but but most of the press did not
[03:14:40.680 --> 03:14:46.120]  talk about uh ram paul when he introduced a bill to do precisely what uh donald trump said he would
[03:14:46.120 --> 03:14:51.720]  do last night the difference is is that ram paul's bill was more focused more carefully worded it
[03:14:51.720 --> 03:14:57.240]  wasn't uh controversial and um just didn't get the press exposure and of course he only had
[03:14:57.240 --> 03:15:02.840]  nine senators join with him to do that uh basically what it would do is suspend the issuance of visas
[03:15:02.840 --> 03:15:08.440]  to refugees from syria and up to other 30 other countries unless they had strict background checks
[03:15:08.440 --> 03:15:12.920]  he introduced that bill back in november 16 that makes sense yeah he introduced that and here's
[03:15:12.920 --> 03:15:17.160]  the difference here's the difference that we're hearing for a lot of people at the same time this
[03:15:17.160 --> 03:15:22.040]  is a washington post talking about this it says same time paul is distancing himself from rubio
[03:15:22.040 --> 03:15:27.320]  and other republican hawks who've argued for further american involvement in iraq and syria to fight
[03:15:27.320 --> 03:15:33.720]  isis and of course that's the whole thing why would we continue this war that created the refugee
[03:15:33.720 --> 03:15:38.520]  humanitarian crisis in the first place and that's what the uh people who are saying like rubio who
[03:15:38.520 --> 03:15:42.040]  want to bring them in he's saying well you know we've got a humanitarian crisis let's bring them
[03:15:42.040 --> 03:15:46.840]  in but let's step up the war and i hear the same thing uh from from trump except he says you're
[03:15:46.840 --> 03:15:51.160]  right don't bring them in but let's step up the war i think the appropriate thing to do
[03:15:51.160 --> 03:15:56.680]  is to stop this war that we started and we all understand that obama created isis that he he
[03:15:56.680 --> 03:16:00.840]  created this whole thing that's the elephant in the room the elephant in the room is western
[03:16:00.840 --> 03:16:06.520]  government started this whole thing end it now yes yes but then it gets even worse alex because one
[03:16:06.520 --> 03:16:11.240]  of the things that they're they're just starting to pick up now the verge ran this uh 17 hours ago
[03:16:11.240 --> 03:16:15.000]  but a lot of news outlets just within the last two or three hours have picked this up and that
[03:16:15.000 --> 03:16:21.240]  was at the same speech last night in mount pleasant south carolina uss yorktown donald trump and we
[03:16:21.240 --> 03:16:25.240]  have the clip here we could we could play it hold it at the moment yeah but but basically he says
[03:16:25.240 --> 03:16:30.280]  we need to close up the internet in some ways because of the threat of of terrorism he says
[03:16:30.280 --> 03:16:34.760]  some people will say freedom of speech freedom of speech he says these are foolish people
[03:16:34.760 --> 03:16:41.800]  now what's foolish is to think that we can achieve safety by selling out our liberties if we throw
[03:16:41.800 --> 03:16:45.720]  the constitution the rule of law in principle under the bus and that's what's important about
[03:16:45.720 --> 03:16:50.200]  these presidential elections look the whole thing is rigged sure i agree with uh with joe scowes and
[03:16:50.200 --> 03:16:54.200]  that they'll probably shut down trump if they feel that he's a threat they shut down uh ron paul they
[03:16:54.200 --> 03:16:58.760]  shut down all third parties that's a real expand on that they did somewhat take it out of context
[03:16:58.760 --> 03:17:03.240]  you just the two words close it up that's like that one senator sing a bunch of tubes
[03:17:03.240 --> 03:17:08.520]  and because he is not going off a teleprompter uh but he should elaborate on this because if he's
[03:17:08.520 --> 03:17:12.760]  not talking about specific war zones or shutting down say al qaeda you know i'm not letting them
[03:17:12.760 --> 03:17:17.480]  promote or whatever i could obviously say you'll see that don't put snuff films on youtube of
[03:17:17.480 --> 03:17:21.800]  eight year olds blowing men's heads off i mean i could say censor that because it's not censorship
[03:17:21.800 --> 03:17:26.200]  it's you know snuff films are illegal but he goes oh no shut the internet off well that's what
[03:17:26.200 --> 03:17:31.320]  obama and the globalists have put in place that's what they want so he needs to clarify this in fact
[03:17:31.320 --> 03:17:39.480]  speaking of it here is the club of donald trump a lot of people because of the internet and we
[03:17:39.480 --> 03:17:44.520]  have to do something we have to go see bill gates and a lot of different people that really understand
[03:17:44.520 --> 03:17:50.440]  what's happening you have to talk to them maybe in certain areas closing that internet up in some way
[03:17:50.440 --> 03:17:57.480]  somebody will say oh freedom of speech freedom of speech these are foolish people well it's in a war
[03:17:57.480 --> 03:18:01.160]  zone you know you jam radio you jam the enemies whatever i could see what he's saying but they're
[03:18:01.160 --> 03:18:05.080]  going to take that out of context uh there it is in some more context what do you say david knife
[03:18:05.080 --> 03:18:08.520]  well i think the context is he's saying that people are going to object to it saying you're
[03:18:08.520 --> 03:18:12.600]  violating our freedom of speech i think that's his intention i think that's his clear intention he
[03:18:12.600 --> 03:18:17.080]  said that he's going to do things to win the war on terror whatever that is however you want to find
[03:18:17.080 --> 03:18:21.320]  the war it's a technique of we talked about that many times but he said he's going to do things
[03:18:21.320 --> 03:18:26.120]  that you've not even heard of you can't even imagine so he's bragging about how he wants to
[03:18:26.120 --> 03:18:29.800]  be authoritarian how he's going to attack freedom of speech and says if you want to defend freedom
[03:18:29.800 --> 03:18:35.240]  of speech you're foolish all right we're going to continue to track and trace all of this david
[03:18:35.240 --> 03:18:39.080]  i'm going to hand the baton to you right now i just want listeners to understand this is a one of a

[03:24:11.240 --> 03:24:14.760]  welcome back to the alex joneshow i'm david night your host on this fourth hour
[03:24:14.760 --> 03:24:22.040]  we have several supreme court decisions that are in the pike that cover everything from
[03:24:22.040 --> 03:24:25.480]  the freedom of the internet that we were just talking about donald trump mentioned that last
[03:24:25.480 --> 03:24:31.560]  night to the supreme court saying that obama can continue to assassinate people in secret
[03:24:32.120 --> 03:24:36.600]  even americans can be assassinated in secret they have no problem with that they give a
[03:24:36.600 --> 03:24:43.080]  nod to an assault weapons ban out of chicago and so i want to talk about this whole thing about the
[03:24:43.080 --> 03:24:49.560]  supreme court being the final decision about what our rights are and we look at that kind of mentality
[03:24:49.560 --> 03:24:54.600]  understand it goes back to marbury versus madison that was a supreme court decision that gave the
[03:24:54.600 --> 03:25:00.120]  supreme court the ultimate last say on everything isn't that interesting how that worked out of course
[03:25:00.120 --> 03:25:04.280]  thomas jefferson disagreed vehemently with it we've had presidents like andrew jackson
[03:25:05.000 --> 03:25:11.000]  who said when the court took the side against him for a national bank he said well the court
[03:25:11.000 --> 03:25:15.880]  has made their decision let's see them enforce it so we at one point in time we did have an
[03:25:15.880 --> 03:25:21.560]  independent executive branch an independent congress that did what they were told and we
[03:25:21.560 --> 03:25:26.360]  had a supreme court that would try to assert its power but that really didn't have the authority
[03:25:26.360 --> 03:25:29.800]  to do that that was never the design of the constitution i don't believe i agree with
[03:25:29.800 --> 03:25:35.960]  jefferson on that and we can see how this works out of course we know that the supreme court has
[03:25:35.960 --> 03:25:41.160]  been on the wrong side of many decisions they said in the dread scott decision that they escaped
[03:25:41.160 --> 03:25:46.200]  fugitive slaves had to be returned they were still the property of their owners in the early 20th
[03:25:46.200 --> 03:25:51.480]  century for a nearly 50 years the supreme court maintained that there was no freedom of speech
[03:25:51.480 --> 03:25:57.800]  for motion pictures and as a matter of fact the second person who was prosecuted under the 1917
[03:25:57.800 --> 03:26:03.480]  espionage act of woodrow wilson to try to get people into try to get america into world war one
[03:26:03.480 --> 03:26:07.000]  the second person who was prosecuted under that was a film producer and guess what the
[03:26:07.000 --> 03:26:13.080]  film was that he produced the spirit of 76 a film about the american revolution but it portrayed the
[03:26:13.080 --> 03:26:19.320]  british in a negative light so woodrow wilson and his censors at various places told him no you
[03:26:19.320 --> 03:26:21.880]  can't you're going to have to cut this out you're going to have to cut that out makes the british
[03:26:21.880 --> 03:26:27.560]  look too bad and we want to go to war on the side of the british well finally they uh he took it out
[03:26:27.560 --> 03:26:31.960]  in in chicago then when it went to la he put the removed scenes back in so they prosecuted him
[03:26:31.960 --> 03:26:37.000]  with a federal prosecution they gave him a fine of $5,000 today that would be equivalent to a half
[03:26:37.000 --> 03:26:41.560]  a million dollars and they sentenced him to 10 years in jail and the supreme court said
[03:26:41.560 --> 03:26:48.440]  first amendment does not apply to films they reversed that later in the 1950s uh and another
[03:26:48.440 --> 03:26:54.600]  case so the supreme court has been on multiple sides of the same issue they were for it before
[03:26:54.600 --> 03:26:58.920]  they were against it as many people say uh they're not infallible they are nine politically
[03:26:58.920 --> 03:27:03.560]  appointed judges let me give you an example of this hillary clinton the other night was giving a
[03:27:03.560 --> 03:27:10.760]  speech and she said we need to keep the nuclear option on the table for iran now james brier one
[03:27:10.760 --> 03:27:14.440]  of the supreme court justices was sitting in the audience and he immediately corrected her said
[03:27:14.440 --> 03:27:20.040]  you mean military option military option and of course she's making these remarks at the
[03:27:20.040 --> 03:27:25.160]  brickings institute saban fortune for relations between the us and israel so she immediately
[03:27:25.160 --> 03:27:31.720]  said oh yes uh military option he's watching her back these guys are political hacks these people
[03:27:31.720 --> 03:27:37.720]  these nine uh unelected unaccountable justices who think that they have it within their power
[03:27:37.720 --> 03:27:42.520]  to modify the constitution as they wish and that's what we really need to be careful about
[03:27:42.520 --> 03:27:47.400]  because coming up we have a lot of things a lot of different attacks from different areas
[03:27:47.400 --> 03:27:50.600]  on the internet just as we were talking about in the last segment with alex jones
[03:27:50.600 --> 03:27:54.040]  in that speech last night that everybody's focused on donald trump talking about how he
[03:27:54.040 --> 03:27:59.800]  would ban all muslims he also said that in order to shut down terrorism we have to in
[03:27:59.800 --> 03:28:04.680]  certain areas close that internet up in some ways and somebody will say oh freedom of speech
[03:28:04.680 --> 03:28:09.800]  freedom of speech those are foolish people so we're going to see people coming after the internet
[03:28:09.800 --> 03:28:15.480]  just as hillary clinton has said the same thing essentially that we need to use the internet
[03:28:15.480 --> 03:28:21.000]  to shut down terrorism in a speech of terrorism we have seen they're going to try to argue for
[03:28:21.000 --> 03:28:26.520]  censorship of the internet based on protecting us from terrorism they're going to argue for it on
[03:28:26.520 --> 03:28:30.520]  the basis of copyright of course it was the story that we had back in the beginning of november
[03:28:31.240 --> 03:28:37.240]  shortly after matt drudge came here and gave the interview where he said supreme court justice
[03:28:37.240 --> 03:28:41.560]  told them they've got the votes to shut down the internet just shut down hyperlinks and of course
[03:28:41.560 --> 03:28:46.200]  they're openly talking about doing that in the european commission the european commission prepared
[03:28:46.200 --> 03:28:49.960]  and this is reported by curt nemo back in november ninth european commission is preparing a frontal
[03:28:49.960 --> 03:28:54.520]  attack on the hyperlink the basic building block of the internet that's how we linked to things
[03:28:54.520 --> 03:29:00.040]  and he points out this is based on an absurd idea that just won't die making search engines and news
[03:29:00.040 --> 03:29:07.400]  portals pay media companies to promote their freely accessible articles now understand that this is
[03:29:07.400 --> 03:29:11.080]  something that isn't just going to shut down uh freedom of speech it isn't just going to shut
[03:29:11.080 --> 03:29:15.640]  down matt drudge it's going to shut down you you are not going to be able to have a political
[03:29:15.640 --> 03:29:20.440]  discourse of people even on facebook we say well i read this article over here i read that article
[03:29:20.440 --> 03:29:24.520]  no they'll come after you for copyright protection so they're going to come after you for copyright
[03:29:24.520 --> 03:29:28.200]  protection they're going to come after you telling you that they're going to make you safe if you'll
[03:29:28.200 --> 03:29:33.640]  just hand over all of your liberties to the man in the white house that is the greatest thing to
[03:29:33.640 --> 03:29:38.680]  fear that is the greatest danger that is the mindset of a slave if you think you're going to
[03:29:38.680 --> 03:29:42.440]  like somebody for president and they're going to protect you after they take away your liberty stay
[03:29:42.440 --> 03:29:54.200]  with us to be right back we're on the march the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio
[03:29:54.200 --> 03:30:03.800]  network the mother of an injured army veteran of the iraq war is selling a rare letter from
[03:30:03.800 --> 03:30:09.080]  president obama to cover her son's medical and personal expenses despite the president's hand
[03:30:09.080 --> 03:30:14.680]  written promise to do everything we can over the next four years to support your family

[03:30:26.600 --> 03:30:33.400]  the note from obama in july 2009 after a non-stop effort to beg federal officials to help her son
[03:30:33.400 --> 03:30:39.560]  david mckimmee mckimmee was campaigned for the veterans administration to do more to help him recover

[03:33:13.880 --> 03:33:20.680]  playing a couple of reports one we're going to play some excerpts for you from the mark dice video
[03:33:20.680 --> 03:33:26.840]  where hillary supporters want her to lower the standard of living i think it's very interesting
[03:33:26.840 --> 03:33:32.040]  that there was an article that just came out today talking about the climate activists going
[03:33:32.040 --> 03:33:36.360]  after our meat and of course this isn't the first time remember we had the epa talking
[03:33:36.360 --> 03:33:39.560]  in halloween about how we had to get rid of pumpkins and at thanksgiving they're talking
[03:33:39.560 --> 03:33:44.040]  about turkey now they're talking about meat you know they want to take our air conditioning our
[03:33:44.040 --> 03:33:49.400]  cars our homes everything folks they're going to shut us down and these are the people who
[03:33:49.400 --> 03:33:54.120]  are flying around in their private jumbo jets telling people in africa you know this is what
[03:33:54.120 --> 03:33:58.200]  obama said we've played the clip for you many times he goes to an audience in african he says
[03:33:58.200 --> 03:34:04.280]  y'all all can't have air conditioning and cars if you did the planet would explode i mean seriously
[03:34:04.280 --> 03:34:09.800]  are we going to criticize donald trump when obama says stuff like that i mean that is absolutely
[03:34:09.800 --> 03:34:15.720]  amazing but it's their mindset so in that vein what they want to do is they want to get rid of
[03:34:15.720 --> 03:34:22.440]  meat now just like we had the the uh gun rights meeting actually there were this gun prohibition
[03:34:22.440 --> 03:34:26.040]  meeting as well they were doing at the steps of the capital we were there covering it and there
[03:34:26.040 --> 03:34:31.960]  was one protester in the audience he said do not you know we will fight your ban on guns and the
[03:34:31.960 --> 03:34:36.520]  austin city councilman said to him uh well we're not trying to ban your guns but you hang on to
[03:34:36.520 --> 03:34:40.920]  that sign we're going to make it come true okay well that's what they're saying here about meat
[03:34:41.560 --> 03:34:46.120]  this is a german member of the european parliament says this is one of the most delicate issues with
[03:34:46.120 --> 03:34:52.280]  climate protection because we all have our habits and diet is something quite holy for some people
[03:34:52.280 --> 03:34:59.560]  not to be meddled with yeah you know it's like my decision what i eat not yours not to be decided by
[03:34:59.560 --> 03:35:04.680]  some know-it-all global governance and that's precisely what they want to do so they say there's
[03:35:04.680 --> 03:35:10.840]  negotiators from 200 countries uh they're focusing on reducing carbon dioxide but they want to focus
[03:35:10.840 --> 03:35:16.440]  right now on other issues they said uh we don't want to tackle this right now because it's going
[03:35:16.440 --> 03:35:20.600]  to put people off the same sort of thing but i want you to understand where they're going
[03:35:20.600 --> 03:35:26.280]  because this is what they say nevertheless the livestock sector is responsible the same article
[03:35:26.280 --> 03:35:29.800]  these people are saying we don't want to scare people by telling them we're going to take away
[03:35:29.800 --> 03:35:34.840]  their food but we want them to understand you know we still have to keep in mind that this is
[03:35:34.840 --> 03:35:40.760]  something's going to be on the plate later on uh because it's responsible for 14 and a half percent
[03:35:40.760 --> 03:35:46.200]  of global greenhouse gas emissions according to them according to them who knows we're not allowed
[03:35:46.200 --> 03:35:50.600]  to question them because they're authority figures but they say it's comparable to all the direct
[03:35:50.600 --> 03:35:55.240]  emissions from cars planes ships and other transportation so understand this folks when
[03:35:55.240 --> 03:36:00.120]  Bernie Sanders comes out and wants to one-up Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton and everybody
[03:36:00.120 --> 03:36:04.840]  else and say i'm going to cut more carbon than anybody i'm going to cut 40 percent of your carbon
[03:36:04.840 --> 03:36:09.720]  usage well they're going to take 14 and a half percent if they shut down all of your transportation
[03:36:09.720 --> 03:36:14.840]  they would get 14 and a half percent then they can shut down all of your meat and livestock
[03:36:14.840 --> 03:36:20.200]  production you know meat turkey chicken all that stuff right you know you just eat greens okay
[03:36:20.200 --> 03:36:24.040]  they can shut down all that they'll get another 14 and a half percent that's still only 29
[03:36:24.040 --> 03:36:28.920]  Bernie Sanders wants to cut it down to 40 percent okay so we got to cut off your air conditioning
[03:36:28.920 --> 03:36:37.080]  downsize your home etc etc these people want to reduce us to serfs understand where they're
[03:36:37.080 --> 03:36:42.200]  headed with this understand what their agenda is and then you can see this because this is the
[03:36:42.760 --> 03:36:49.000]  crony climatism the people who are too green to fail in this same article they're talking about
[03:36:49.000 --> 03:36:54.680]  now they promote here's their solution something like the impossible burger which is made entirely
[03:36:54.680 --> 03:37:01.160]  from plants and guess who's funding the impossible burger made out of plants bill gates and google
[03:37:01.800 --> 03:37:07.720]  bill gates and google ventures are going to do that so understand meat is evil don't be evil
[03:37:07.720 --> 03:37:13.560]  as google would say so buy my synthetic soylent green and shut off your air conditioning give
[03:37:13.560 --> 03:37:18.680]  up your car downsize your home don't eat turkey don't eat pumpkins don't eat meat because we are
[03:37:18.680 --> 03:37:23.080]  going to control your life and we're going to rub your nose into the dirt now if they really wanted
[03:37:23.080 --> 03:37:28.200]  to get green what they would do is they would lay off a cannabis because it's one of the easiest
[03:37:28.200 --> 03:37:33.320]  growing things to take the co2 right out of the atmosphere what do they do when you pay them a
[03:37:33.320 --> 03:37:37.640]  carbon tax well they give it to somebody like algorn supposedly goes somewhere and he plants a tree
[03:37:37.640 --> 03:37:41.880]  and after many many years this tree will get leaves and it will start to suck up carbon dioxide well
[03:37:41.880 --> 03:37:47.880]  we've already got trees and guess what god designed a resilient system that when the carbon dioxide
[03:37:47.880 --> 03:37:53.640]  goes up the plants consume that and produce more leaves and produce more oxygen and more oxygen
[03:37:53.640 --> 03:37:59.560]  puts a balance the system back in balance and of course pot and weed is going to do that much
[03:37:59.560 --> 03:38:05.320]  faster than anything else you've probably heard about the study that they found this one area one
[03:38:05.320 --> 03:38:10.440]  airport that didn't have the cluster of a sickness that typically accompanies airports and what they
[03:38:10.440 --> 03:38:16.280]  found was a large cannabis field there in chili they're going to remove from the hard drugs list
[03:38:16.280 --> 03:38:22.600]  pot off of the hard drugs list now where does this hard drugs list come from it's another
[03:38:22.600 --> 03:38:28.360]  un agenda do you understand it was in 1961 the un created an agenda where they gave us the four
[03:38:28.360 --> 03:38:35.640]  schedules and it was 10 years later that richard nixon the same guy who created the epa gave us
[03:38:35.640 --> 03:38:42.760]  the war on drugs exactly mimicking the four schedules for the war on drugs that have been
[03:38:42.760 --> 03:38:48.840]  created 10 years earlier by the united nations that's why chilies uh got the same schedule as
[03:38:48.840 --> 03:38:52.520]  we do in the united states and so they're going to say well we're going to take it off of the
[03:38:52.520 --> 03:38:57.480]  schedule one drug we're going to allow it to be used for medical purposes and so forth and so
[03:38:57.480 --> 03:39:03.720]  on allowed to be sold that is a un agenda that was imposed on people and conservatives need to
[03:39:03.720 --> 03:39:10.120]  understand that this war of prohibition that we've been fighting for 40 plus years is nothing but a
[03:39:10.120 --> 03:39:13.880]  you an agenda now i want to go to these reports that we've got before i do i want to let you

[03:40:04.200 --> 03:40:08.840]  interesting to me because you know what i'm trying to get off the grid in multiple ways one way
[03:40:08.840 --> 03:40:14.040]  i want to get off the grid is when i get finished with my contract my iphone i'm getting off of their
[03:40:14.040 --> 03:40:18.920]  surveillance grid with that i'm looking at analog watches i'm going back to pagers if anybody wants
[03:40:18.920 --> 03:40:23.960]  to get in touch with me and burner phones because i am sick of this it's my way of saying no you know
[03:40:23.960 --> 03:40:30.920]  what freedom speech privacy due process it really does matter to me and um so uh anyway take a look
[03:40:30.920 --> 03:40:37.000]  at that it's a new product we have a g-shock watch it does uh an analog and digital uh a watch that
[03:40:37.000 --> 03:40:42.600]  never breaks and we're selling that at info wars store dot com going back to uh what we were just
[03:40:42.600 --> 03:40:48.760]  talking about going back to the climate activists saying that um well you know we need to um we did
[03:40:48.760 --> 03:40:53.880]  shut down meat for people cars air conditioning homes everything people are willingly supporting
[03:40:53.880 --> 03:41:00.040]  this i mean this is mark dice goes out and gets people to say uh interesting things but you know
[03:41:00.040 --> 03:41:06.680]  quite frankly these people are begging to have their lifestyle eviscerated as well as will point
[03:41:06.680 --> 03:41:11.880]  out their lifespan because the two go hand in hand if you cut down energy use it's the best indicator
[03:41:11.880 --> 03:41:19.320]  not only of uh it it affects our lifestyle but it's the best indicator of life expectancy and so
[03:41:19.320 --> 03:41:23.560]  these people are all on board of that the problem is i'd be happy if they want to do that on their
[03:41:23.560 --> 03:41:28.680]  own go for it they want to cut down mine and i don't agree with that but here's what some of the
[03:41:28.680 --> 03:41:35.800]  people had to say to mark dice you probably saw hillary clinton has promised to lower the
[03:41:35.800 --> 03:41:42.920]  standard of living if she gets elected do you think that's long overdue yeah actually i don't
[03:41:42.920 --> 03:41:49.080]  really know what that means hold on let her answer um i think the standard of living should be lower
[03:41:49.080 --> 03:41:56.680]  because i like to go to the bars and drink the alcohol for a lower okay hey hold on hold on
[03:41:56.680 --> 03:42:02.520]  hey let her answer hillary clinton obviously is promising to lower the standard of living if
[03:42:02.520 --> 03:42:08.600]  she's elected are you looking forward to that yeah yeah is that is that a good campaign platform to
[03:42:08.600 --> 03:42:13.720]  be running on to lower the standard of living yeah yeah you think hillary clinton's the woman to
[03:42:13.720 --> 03:42:19.560]  finally do that for america maybe take the baton from obama and continue the the plan of lowering
[03:42:19.560 --> 03:42:27.080]  the standard of living maybe i don't think i even know what a standard of living is well the news is
[03:42:27.080 --> 03:42:33.560]  that hillary as you probably saw hillary clinton has promised to lower the standard of living if
[03:42:33.560 --> 03:42:40.760]  she gets elected like how so in what regard well just through her economic policies are you looking
[03:42:40.760 --> 03:42:46.040]  forward to that well tell you what's going to happen is bernie sanders is going to be during
[03:42:46.040 --> 03:42:51.000]  the primaries and he's going to be our next president of the united states so i feel
[03:42:52.680 --> 03:42:59.320]  feel strength with bernie and uh he'll do better than obama but this is about hillary clinton oh
[03:42:59.320 --> 03:43:05.640]  hillary hillary hillary obviously is promising to lower the standard of living if she gets elected
[03:43:05.640 --> 03:43:11.000]  do you think that's a good campaign platform to stand on you know it works for her because it
[03:43:11.000 --> 03:43:16.520]  definitely fits her personality but as an american i don't think i could stand behind that and might
[03:43:16.520 --> 03:43:23.160]  have to go with trump you know if that's the case this is for the news it's a web segment for the
[03:43:23.160 --> 03:43:28.680]  news okay probably saw hillary clinton has promised to lower the standard of living if she gets elected
[03:43:28.680 --> 03:43:33.720]  or are you looking forward to that you think she can keep that promise you're excited about the
[03:43:33.720 --> 03:43:40.360]  lower the standard lower the standard i haven't i don't really keep up with that okay she really
[03:43:40.360 --> 03:43:45.960]  doesn't keep up with the standard of living she's not really sure what that is okay let me talk about
[03:43:45.960 --> 03:43:49.800]  bernie you know because the guy says well she's not going to make it past the primaries it's going
[03:43:49.800 --> 03:43:53.880]  to be bernie yeah he's going to lower your standard of living let me let me tell you you know if he's
[03:43:53.880 --> 03:43:59.880]  people who are buying into socialism that is what will lower your standard of living down in venezuela
[03:43:59.880 --> 03:44:05.560]  i remember bernie sanders back in the mid 1980s he loved nicaragua and the sandernistas as i like
[03:44:05.560 --> 03:44:09.880]  to call them because he just thought those guys hung the moon but of course they were thrown out
[03:44:09.880 --> 03:44:14.200]  there were nothing but a bunch of kleptocrats posing as socialists because that's what socialists
[03:44:14.200 --> 03:44:20.600]  are they're a bunch of thieves and now they're seeing the fruit of socialism in venezuela
[03:44:20.600 --> 03:44:28.040]  they've had the worst ever defeat of leftists this is after 20 years of rule by uh hugo chavez
[03:44:28.040 --> 03:44:35.000]  and his his co-thieves what they've done is they've shrunk a gross domestic product went down by 10
[03:44:35.000 --> 03:44:41.000]  percent just this last year another six percent is projected for next year they have 18 percent
[03:44:41.000 --> 03:44:45.640]  unemployment how's that for socialism lowering your standard of living okay and here's the other
[03:44:45.640 --> 03:44:51.480]  thing socialists love to do they love to shut down free speech and so what they have done they say
[03:44:51.480 --> 03:44:55.960]  well one of the outcomes they said what could possibly happen now that we've got now we've
[03:44:55.960 --> 03:45:01.960]  found the uh hugo chavez socialists out they say well it looks like maybe opposition leaders could
[03:45:01.960 --> 03:45:10.120]  be released from jail because you know liberals do not like to have other people who have a
[03:45:10.120 --> 03:45:15.640]  different opinion if you disagree with them on climate change they they label you a criminal
[03:45:15.640 --> 03:45:19.640]  as we saw early in the program when alex jones was talking to mark morano they say he's wanted
[03:45:19.640 --> 03:45:24.920]  he's a climate criminal they want to shut you down because you're a denier and that's precisely
[03:45:24.920 --> 03:45:29.240]  uh what they are going to do if they get control the internet as i mentioned before we got people
[03:45:29.240 --> 03:45:32.760]  who want to say we're going to shut down the internet because of terrorism that's what uh
[03:45:32.760 --> 03:45:37.240]  trump is saying now we got people who want to shut it down because they want more money
[03:45:37.240 --> 03:45:43.000]  for copyrights and that's what's uh being talked about in the european union and then we got three
[03:45:43.000 --> 03:45:50.600]  judges uh in a district appeal court uh in dc saying that they want to allow internet providers to
[03:45:50.600 --> 03:45:57.400]  essentially uh shut down the internet for speed so that they can prefer their own people whoever
[03:45:57.400 --> 03:46:02.200]  is paying them the higher fees there are so many different fronts which they're attacking the internet
[03:46:02.200 --> 03:46:07.000]  because the internet is where freedom of speech is lived the internet is where you can have political
[03:46:07.000 --> 03:46:10.760]  discourse and understand that if they criminalize hyperlinks as they're talking about doing in the
[03:46:10.760 --> 03:46:16.200]  european union as drudge says uh a supreme court judges hold him they're going to do in america if
[03:46:16.200 --> 03:46:22.120]  they do that uh think about what you see on wikipedia you see footnotes at the bottom with
[03:46:22.120 --> 03:46:27.240]  links to the different articles that people use to reference and to back up what they're saying
[03:46:27.240 --> 03:46:33.400]  they want you to be completely divorced from any facts and have to rely completely on the
[03:46:33.400 --> 03:46:37.400]  pronouncements of people in authority they don't want you to be able to check anything that's what
[03:46:37.400 --> 03:46:43.960]  has really changed things fundamentally back in the day we had uh news anchors at abc cbs nbc
[03:46:43.960 --> 03:46:47.880]  they told us what to think they all said the same thing they covered the same stories they gave the
[03:46:47.880 --> 03:46:53.160]  same angle and we listened to them as authority figures because they were telling us what the
[03:46:53.160 --> 03:46:58.760]  government wanted us to to know we had no way to check the facts and if they destroy the hyperlink
[03:46:58.760 --> 03:47:04.120]  they will destroy that there is no copyright protection when you use footnotes in a book
[03:47:04.120 --> 03:47:08.680]  and you say uh you know i'm referencing this to uh such and such a book or whatever and that's
[03:47:08.680 --> 03:47:13.320]  essentially what's being done with wikipedia that's what matt drudge does they want to shut that down
[03:47:13.320 --> 03:47:19.560]  because they want to shut down political discourse they want to shut down any debate of of anything
[03:47:19.560 --> 03:47:25.960]  that they want to uh ram down your throat now as we're looking at uh we've been talking all day
[03:47:25.960 --> 03:47:32.680]  about this uh pronouncement of how trump would deal with um with muslim saying i'm just going to
[03:47:32.680 --> 03:47:37.800]  shut down all muslim immigration and as i pointed out earlier ram paul came up with a bill that was
[03:47:37.800 --> 03:47:43.880]  a lot more thoughtful he didn't just uh wield his mouth as a blunt instrument uh back in november
[03:47:43.880 --> 03:47:49.240]  16th he had three different points so listen to this bill which got absolutely no support
[03:47:49.240 --> 03:47:55.480]  in congress uh ted cruise voted with him uh jeff sessions voted with him jeff sessions is almost
[03:47:55.480 --> 03:48:00.680]  always on the right side uh an honest man even when i disagree with him but here's the three
[03:48:00.680 --> 03:48:07.080]  points that rubio and lindsay graham and many others uh essentially the other 90 senators did
[03:48:07.080 --> 03:48:12.040]  not agree with number one aliens already admitted from high-risk countries have have been fingerprinted
[03:48:12.040 --> 03:48:16.440]  and screened and posed no terrorist and are being monitored for terrorist activity in other words
[03:48:16.440 --> 03:48:20.520]  this would allow them to get these are the three steps that would allow them to get a visa so you've
[03:48:20.520 --> 03:48:24.520]  screened them because they're coming from a high-risk uh territory number two if they're coming from a
[03:48:24.520 --> 03:48:29.640]  high-risk territory then get a visa if they also have enhanced security measures in place to screen
[03:48:29.640 --> 03:48:33.880]  future applicants to prevent terrorists from entering the country and number three homeland
[03:48:33.880 --> 03:48:39.400]  securities visa entry exit system has to be a hundred percent complete we don't even have a system
[03:48:39.400 --> 03:48:44.120]  folks it doesn't work because they haven't even finished a system to take a look at these people
[03:48:44.120 --> 03:48:49.320]  then we have to have a tracking system in place to catch attempted overstays now when he pointed
[03:48:49.320 --> 03:48:56.440]  all of this out uh marco rubio and uh lindsay graham and uh 88 other senators just said nah
[03:48:56.440 --> 03:49:02.040]  never mind we're going to just ignore that so that's why donald trump is talking about uh
[03:49:02.040 --> 03:49:06.280]  we just got to stop all the muslims that are coming from these other countries in a blunt way
[03:49:06.280 --> 03:49:12.120]  because when you talk about it from a rational standpoint as rand paul did in this bill it gets
[03:49:12.120 --> 03:49:17.320]  absolutely no support in the senate and it gets absolutely no discussion in the media but it is
[03:49:17.320 --> 03:49:23.720]  something we need to wake up and understand that uh we just cannot have open borders we cannot say
[03:49:24.360 --> 03:49:30.120]  that the one right that we are going to establish is the right of anyone in the world to come here
[03:49:30.120 --> 03:49:35.240]  unvetted and live in america either vote in our elections without being a citizen or become a
[03:49:35.240 --> 03:49:40.440]  citizen or to take our jobs or if they rather not work have us support them have us put them through
[03:49:40.440 --> 03:49:47.320]  college giving them benefits that are greater than even those our children have that has to stop uh
[03:49:47.320 --> 03:49:53.480]  let's now um let's go to this report from joe biggs because he's been traveling the country
[03:49:53.480 --> 03:49:58.920]  looking at these areas where there's a lot of um we'll play this when we come back after the break
[03:49:58.920 --> 03:50:03.560]  because there's not enough time for this i i got off on this tangent we're going to play a clip
[03:50:03.560 --> 03:50:09.320]  from joe biggs because he looks at the whole issue of sharia law and you have to understand
[03:50:09.320 --> 03:50:15.640]  that it is fundamental to islamic theology that they must dominate the world that is part of their
[03:50:15.640 --> 03:50:23.560]  theology it is a refutation of islam being a true religion when they do not dominate the world and
[03:50:23.560 --> 03:50:30.280]  so of course they are going to try to establish sharia law as as widely and as thoroughly as they
[03:50:30.280 --> 03:50:36.760]  can we've had them admit that on uh poll after poll why can't we believe that so when we come back
[03:50:36.760 --> 03:50:42.520]  we're going to have a part of the report uh it's up on uh alex jones's youtube channel of joe
[03:50:42.520 --> 03:50:58.440]  biggs talking to people about sharia law we'll be right back
[03:50:59.400 --> 03:51:06.120]  my name is don whiskin in 1994 i lost my 62 year old father to complications of bypass surgery
[03:51:06.120 --> 03:51:11.880]  in 1977 my 44 year old brother was found dead in his apartment he suffered a heart attack

[03:53:06.600 --> 03:53:11.400]  when we recognize that we need to be better prepared we typically do the same thing we start
[03:53:11.400 --> 03:53:16.440]  with food storage then we address the need for water but have you considered heat storage i'm
[03:53:16.440 --> 03:53:21.560]  talking about staying warm in the cold here are some things for you to consider how will i keep my
[03:53:21.560 --> 03:53:26.280]  family warm the standard answers are firewood coal or propane but the problem with that if you need
[03:53:26.280 --> 03:53:31.960]  to be on the move is you can't take it with you another concern there may come a time when you
[03:53:31.960 --> 03:53:36.520]  need to stay warm without smoke like in times of war there may even come a time when you can't
[03:53:36.520 --> 03:53:42.520]  burn fuel the answers may be simpler and less costly than you think for these answers go to

[03:54:18.360 --> 03:54:28.760]  this is a special report from joe biggs as he's traveling the united states and this report is
[03:54:28.760 --> 03:54:36.200]  the rumors are true sharia law is here what you're looking at now if you're watching this if you're
[03:54:36.200 --> 03:54:42.200]  listening on the radio what we're seeing here is a footage that joe and our photographers are
[03:54:42.200 --> 03:54:47.720]  traveling with him are taking aerial footage in areas in america that are highly concentrated
[03:54:47.720 --> 03:54:55.400]  with islamic population joe biggs here with info wars dot com now we are in dearborn michigan we're
[03:54:55.400 --> 03:55:02.200]  actually uh leaving the islamic center of america it's one of the uh it is the largest mosque in the
[03:55:02.200 --> 03:55:07.560]  united states uh we're all we were out there we did the alex shown show earlier today and during
[03:55:07.560 --> 03:55:11.160]  that time there were some people who were listening to the show uh obviously they could see the
[03:55:11.160 --> 03:55:15.000]  background because they were watching and found where we were and decided to come out and kind of
[03:55:15.000 --> 03:55:20.440]  give us some information i interviewed a couple of people and uh what two of the guys there had to
[03:55:20.440 --> 03:55:27.080]  say was extremely interesting i'm talking huge breaking news uh as the news started uh i don't
[03:55:27.080 --> 03:55:32.200]  remember exactly what time but it was in the early evening uh there were uh at first there was a loud
[03:55:32.200 --> 03:55:38.120]  crack and startled me and then i'm like okay what was that and shortly thereafter there were several
[03:55:38.120 --> 03:55:45.320]  more fireworks going on uh what what i found out to be later were fireworks and in the streets i
[03:55:45.320 --> 03:55:49.400]  did not see the people however it was several blocks away from me within maybe four or five
[03:55:49.400 --> 03:55:55.560]  blocks from my house people were shouting a la akbar and that was wow they were so they had
[03:55:55.560 --> 03:56:01.960]  fireworks going they were screaming a lot about our a lot of akbar and basically celebrating the
[03:56:01.960 --> 03:56:07.960]  attacks that happened in paris yes sir and that was uh quite disturbing to me especially living in
[03:56:07.960 --> 03:56:14.840]  america that is just that's unacceptable i mean how how can you i don't know i'm sorry i just don't
[03:56:14.840 --> 03:56:19.240]  understand how people can celebrate death and for those of you not watching this that man was afraid
[03:56:19.240 --> 03:56:27.640]  to have his face on camera in dearborn right across from where this huge mosque is chanting alahu akbar
[03:56:27.640 --> 03:56:33.560]  so you know that's crazy we heard about that after 9 11 donald trump told the story a lot of people
[03:56:33.560 --> 03:56:38.440]  have been criticizing that and we have another instance now where that's going on uh so now
[03:56:38.440 --> 03:56:45.640]  we're heading over to ham tramuk uh which is another area around detroit and this area has
[03:56:45.640 --> 03:56:52.840]  the al islam islamic center which is a call to prayer building where they uh do their prayers
[03:56:52.840 --> 03:56:59.240]  five times a day now this area is much different than dearborn dearborn has a large population
[03:56:59.240 --> 03:57:05.240]  but the way ham tramuk is is it looks like a long street that you would see any rock with a whole
[03:57:05.240 --> 03:57:13.640]  bunch of bizarre store set up traditional uh you know muslim wear and head dresses man jammies is
[03:57:13.640 --> 03:57:17.400]  what i call them i know it's not the correct term but that's what we always said when we were in
[03:57:17.400 --> 03:57:23.320]  iraq and afghanistan uh all most of the signs out there not all but most are uh in some form of
[03:57:23.320 --> 03:57:27.720]  arabic so there's there's people there from yemen there's people there from poland there's people
[03:57:27.720 --> 03:57:36.280]  there from iraq afghanistan syria so there's a huge melting pot of uh islamic people so we're
[03:57:36.280 --> 03:57:40.840]  going to go out here and uh try to catch some of the call to prayer see what's going on you know
[03:57:40.840 --> 03:57:46.200]  we're hearing uh more information about the attacks in san bernadino where they are now
[03:57:46.200 --> 03:57:53.960]  saying that it is confirmed that this is indeed an isis attack that uh the guy furuk traveled to
[03:57:53.960 --> 03:58:00.840]  saudi arabia into finding his wife got her over here on a fiance visa is what they said in the paper
[03:58:01.560 --> 03:58:06.360]  and they believe that she's the one who has a radicalized this man but you have to remember
[03:58:06.360 --> 03:58:11.000]  too as well the mainstream media has been very reluctant very uh what's the best way to put it
[03:58:11.000 --> 03:58:17.320]  like holding back the fact that this could be terrorism um but right off the get go when that
[03:58:17.320 --> 03:58:22.200]  attack happened in san bernadino that the report was three white men and then went from three white
[03:58:22.200 --> 03:58:28.440]  men throughout the day to a couple okay we're gonna have to end it there and of course if you
