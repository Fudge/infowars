[00:00.000 --> 00:09.000]  media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN
[00:09.000 --> 00:23.000]  Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:23.000 --> 00:27.000]  Welcome, my friends, all of you across the planet. Thank you for joining us today. We're
[00:27.000 --> 00:37.000]  live. It is Monday, the 9th day of June, 2008. And we're going to be live here for the next
[00:37.000 --> 00:42.000]  four hours. Jim Tucker with an overview of everything that happened at Bilderberg last
[00:42.000 --> 00:47.000]  week and throughout the weekend until Sunday. We'll be joining us with major breaking news
[00:47.000 --> 00:54.000]  in 30 minutes. He already disclosed it to me Saturday night, and we'll be dealing with
[00:54.000 --> 00:59.000]  are they planning to attack Iran? What Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, former
[00:59.000 --> 01:06.000]  director of the Central Intelligence Agency, discussed when he was there at the
[01:06.000 --> 01:13.000]  Westfields Marriott in Chantilly, Virginia for Bilderberg, 2008, scene of the crime.
[01:13.000 --> 01:18.000]  We'll talk about some of the people I personally saw coming in and out of the event. We'll
[01:18.000 --> 01:25.000]  talk about secret service and military intelligence, as well as individuals from the
[01:25.000 --> 01:31.000]  State Department Protective Service running around in clown masks. You cannot make this
[01:31.000 --> 01:35.000]  type of stuff up. This is something right out of a movie. Provocateur actions, you name
[01:35.000 --> 01:39.000]  it. Of course, I've gotten death threats over the years and stalkers and things that
[01:39.000 --> 01:45.000]  have happened. But it was a clear government MO. And clearly, folks from the Bilderberg
[01:45.000 --> 01:51.000]  group or one of the incendiary agencies guarding the kingpin criminals called my wife
[01:51.000 --> 01:55.000]  yesterday with an extremely dirty trick. Of course, it only made our family come
[01:55.000 --> 01:59.000]  together and be that much stronger and just reaffirm that you are the criminals. You
[01:59.000 --> 02:03.000]  are the enemies of the Republic. You are the enemies of everything good and decent.
[02:03.000 --> 02:07.000]  You are the people destroying this country and enslaving the entire planet. And you
[02:07.000 --> 02:14.000]  will be brought to justice. So we'll be discussing that coming up as well today. Make
[02:14.000 --> 02:20.000]  no mistake, the Bilderberg group is the tip top of the power pyramid. And I just want
[02:20.000 --> 02:24.000]  to point out to listeners that the hundreds of people, I would say probably 400 people
[02:24.000 --> 02:29.000]  came out over the four days because a lot of people were only there for one day, I
[02:29.000 --> 02:34.000]  would ask them. We had as many as 150 people at one time out there demonstrating,
[02:34.000 --> 02:42.000]  protesting, and of course, engaging in alternative grassroots media exposure of the
[02:42.000 --> 02:47.000]  Bilderberg group. And I just want to point out that all of these men and women, some
[02:47.000 --> 02:52.000]  people even brought their children out, have exceptional courage because to go and
[02:52.000 --> 02:57.000]  bullhorn and go and demonstrate in protest and have secret service, aim MP5
[02:57.000 --> 03:02.000]  submachine guns at you to be followed by military intelligence to have people visit
[03:02.000 --> 03:06.000]  some of the folks that went out there at their homes and threatened them in front of
[03:06.000 --> 03:11.000]  their families to go through this and to put yourselves in the way of the fist of
[03:11.000 --> 03:14.000]  the global crime syndicate. These are people that have killed millions and
[03:14.000 --> 03:19.000]  millions of people just in the last few years and hundreds of millions in the last
[03:19.000 --> 03:24.000]  century and they brag about that by the way. It's just amazing courage and of course
[03:24.000 --> 03:29.000]  to be the very tip of the spear, to be pretty much the leader out there, myself and
[03:29.000 --> 03:34.000]  Jim Tucker takes even more courage and we couldn't do it without God's support and
[03:34.000 --> 03:38.000]  blessing of course and all the glory goes to God. I want to thank you all for your
[03:38.000 --> 03:43.000]  prayers but they certainly hate us and they certainly hate freedom and the stories
[03:43.000 --> 03:50.000]  I have to tell, it's just unbelievable everything that happened and everything
[03:50.000 --> 03:55.000]  that unfolded. I want to commend the listeners. I've looked at our web traffic
[03:55.000 --> 04:00.000]  ratings are both internal information, of course external Alexa and StatBrain and
[04:00.000 --> 04:06.000]  others. Infowars.com has never had this much traffic. It is rated bigger than
[04:06.000 --> 04:11.000]  WorldNet Daily, bigger than Newsmax, bigger than all the major sites now.
[04:11.000 --> 04:16.000]  The so-called alternative sites that have proven to be shell-like in the past.
[04:16.000 --> 04:24.000]  Prison Planet has the highest ratings that it has ever had as well but Infowars
[04:24.000 --> 04:30.000]  has absolutely left orbit. I mean it is just blasting off and that is all
[04:30.000 --> 04:34.000]  because you have been spreading the word and I ask you to reaffirm the Infowar

[07:55.160 --> 08:01.720]  From his Central Texas Command Center deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[08:01.720 --> 08:27.240]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network. Okay, as best I can, let me walk through some
[08:27.240 --> 08:34.000]  of the most important facets of what happened Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday,
[08:34.000 --> 08:38.080]  and then of course yesterday on Sunday. I know a lot of you've already gotten pieces
[08:38.080 --> 08:43.400]  of this, but let me give you just a basic overview then I'll zoom back in for a closer
[08:43.400 --> 08:51.160]  look into some of the key developments and activities and things that transpired in the
[08:51.160 --> 09:00.360]  last five days. We left here at about 2.30 in the afternoon. Tuesday, Central Time arrived
[09:00.360 --> 09:08.120]  in Maryland at about 10 o'clock at night, got to the hotel in Virginia. We flew into
[09:08.120 --> 09:16.280]  Baltimore. We checked in. There were security people there at the Westfields Marriott when
[09:16.280 --> 09:23.560]  you walked in the door. When we checked in, they questioned us why we were there when
[09:23.560 --> 09:31.840]  we checked in. The bell hops were rude and aggressive, asking us why we were there.
[09:31.840 --> 09:36.840]  We then went up to our rooms. We came down and ate at the bar. We saw a lot of other
[09:36.840 --> 09:41.400]  fellow patriots in there who we, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to be rude, but we really couldn't
[09:41.400 --> 09:46.680]  talk to you because I didn't want to be completely obvious and get thrown out early. Many times
[09:46.680 --> 09:50.560]  Bilderberg shuts hotels down on the Wednesday, though it only really starts on the Thursday
[09:50.560 --> 09:56.200]  at noon. This time it did not throw people out on Wednesday. They threw everybody out
[09:56.200 --> 10:03.080]  on Thursday at noon. On that Wednesday, we were in the hotel, tried to get video, tried
[10:03.080 --> 10:07.400]  to get video of the meeting rooms, were followed everywhere, and they tried to stop us. They
[10:07.400 --> 10:13.000]  were unsuccessful. The people have a right to know when policy is being set, when federal
[10:13.000 --> 10:17.960]  officials are violating federal law, violating the Logan Act, discussing and setting policy
[10:17.960 --> 10:28.040]  in private with 100 robber barons, the owners of central banks, the kings and queens of Europe,
[10:28.040 --> 10:31.000]  the Rothschilds, the Rockefellers, and they were all there, by the way, we'll get into
[10:31.000 --> 10:39.720]  who was there. The list is up on infoawards.com. I was doing live updates from the hotel Tuesday
[10:39.720 --> 10:43.800]  night, Wednesday night, and then of course from the Hyatt, excuse me, Hilton, where we
[10:43.800 --> 10:50.720]  were staying on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday. I did updates Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday.
[10:50.720 --> 10:54.040]  I'm scheduled to do another update or recap tonight on Coast to Coast AM on this Monday
[10:54.040 --> 11:01.640]  night, now that it's all over, and we did live reports from there in our hotel room those
[11:01.640 --> 11:11.440]  nights. Wednesday night, Tuesday night was uneventful, Wednesday night, we went around
[11:11.440 --> 11:15.640]  the hotel trying to get video as they were setting up for the conference the next day,
[11:15.640 --> 11:21.440]  were followed everywhere there, some security people walked up to us, myself and Rob Jacobson
[11:21.440 --> 11:26.040]  as we were walking through the halls and just walked up and said, do you know about people
[11:26.040 --> 11:30.800]  pulling fire alarms? You know, we've had people come in here and pull fire alarms and then
[11:30.800 --> 11:38.240]  try to steal things like that vase you see sitting right there. And I said, well, that's
[11:38.240 --> 11:42.480]  an interesting story. Wow, well, thank you. And they said, don't videotape them. We had
[11:42.480 --> 11:48.440]  hidden cameras, but they obviously knew that. And I said, okay, well, all right. I don't
[11:48.440 --> 11:52.600]  know what you're talking about. So we went back up to the room and right as we walk into
[11:52.600 --> 11:56.720]  the room, we had independent film channel in there who'd been interviewing us who we'd
[11:56.720 --> 12:06.560]  brought up. And Andrew Neil, Tom Davis and others, their film covers Bilderberg 2006,
[12:06.560 --> 12:15.440]  2007 and Bilderberg 2008 will be on IFC early next year, big production by the way. It's
[12:15.440 --> 12:21.640]  an IFC production. And thank God they were there to document because we got into the
[12:21.640 --> 12:27.160]  room right as we walk in the room. The phone rings, it's Tom Danheiser from Coast to Coast
[12:27.160 --> 12:33.320]  AM to get me on the radio show for a report. And right as we walk in the phone rings all
[12:33.320 --> 12:41.360]  at once, the fire alarm goes off. And Jason Burmans did a great job sitting in while I
[12:41.360 --> 12:46.120]  was gone, you know, played that clip for you. Thursday morning, right after it happened,
[12:46.120 --> 12:50.440]  many of you heard it live on Coast to Coast AM. Before I forget, I want to thank George
[12:50.440 --> 12:54.840]  Norrie for his coverage that gave us a lot of protection. There's no telling what they
[12:54.840 --> 12:58.800]  would have done if they weren't fully aware that we were going on that show and doing
[12:58.800 --> 13:03.200]  reports. We're very thankful to him. Be sure and email him and thank him all of you out
[13:03.200 --> 13:07.480]  there so he knows we do appreciate it. And then I publicly am thanking him because I
[13:07.480 --> 13:12.280]  really do the only big national media with tens of millions of listeners that covered
[13:12.280 --> 13:20.000]  this kind of a break in the Berlin Wall, the iron curtain of media control, absolutely
[13:20.000 --> 13:24.600]  no mainstream media coverage, as you know, other than Coast to Coast AM. And then of
[13:24.600 --> 13:28.120]  course this radio show, but really both these shows cannot be called mainstream, but his
[13:28.120 --> 13:34.320]  can be called mega huge, very large, second largest radio show in the country, 16 million
[13:34.320 --> 13:46.720]  listeners plus. But I was there and we're in the room. This alarm's going off and George
[13:46.720 --> 13:50.360]  is doing the news. So I sit there for about four minutes on hold while he's covering the
[13:50.360 --> 13:58.520]  news before he goes to me, waiting while it drones in the background. We go to George.
[13:58.520 --> 14:04.000]  George goes to us and I began to break down the fact that they had come up to us that
[14:04.000 --> 14:08.000]  they had talked about fire alarms, that I believe we were being in the process of being
[14:08.000 --> 14:14.160]  shut up. Then we look out the windows and see several hundred guests just in the front
[14:14.160 --> 14:20.440]  area. They're pouring out other exits as well. And I said, we have got to get out of here.
[14:20.440 --> 14:28.840]  We hung up with George. We went downstairs and there are hundreds of people out front.
[14:28.840 --> 14:32.440]  They're Japanese people with still cameras taking shots. There's families with their
[14:32.440 --> 14:38.320]  video cameras out. There's fire trucks pulling up. They come right over to us in the back
[14:38.320 --> 14:44.360]  of the crowd and say, because Rob had a camera, a little small camera in his hand to down
[14:44.360 --> 14:49.640]  to the side and said, don't videotape. I've already called the police on you for what
[14:49.640 --> 14:53.320]  you've done. And Rob says, what I've done. What have I done? And they're like, well,
[14:53.320 --> 15:00.160]  you know, don't videotape or I'm going to F you up. And then I said, Rob, I walk right
[15:00.160 --> 15:03.000]  over to him, whispering his ear while the guy's the head security guard standing over
[15:03.000 --> 15:09.120]  us. He's got some government goons behind him. I said, Rob, get out of here now. Just
[15:09.120 --> 15:13.920]  break off. I'll let him take me to jail for whatever setup this is. Get the tapes out.
[15:13.920 --> 15:19.640]  He also always carried the backpack on his back with the tapes so they can't be stolen
[15:19.640 --> 15:23.760]  out of the room. Call him the turtle because he's the guy that always carries the tapes.
[15:23.760 --> 15:28.320]  He breaks off and leaves and I go up to the guy. Well, actually comes back up to me and
[15:28.320 --> 15:32.560]  I'm saying, listen, everybody else is taping. And he said, listen to me, Alex, we're going
[15:32.560 --> 15:38.000]  to F you and Rob up. Now Rob's name wasn't on the registry. No one knew his name was.
[15:38.000 --> 15:42.120]  He hadn't said what his name was. My name wasn't registered. My name. He said, listen,
[15:42.120 --> 15:48.120]  Alex, we will F you and Rob up. He was looking at me with pure hatred. So they knew who we
[15:48.120 --> 15:53.840]  were. And it was that same individual with another person. He didn't do the talking
[15:53.840 --> 16:02.560]  about about the fire alarm just 25 minutes before that. So
[16:02.560 --> 16:10.280]  you can make of that what you will. But that was definitely some type of staged event.
[16:10.280 --> 16:15.040]  We then went back to the room, went to sleep about two in the morning, got up about seven
[16:15.040 --> 16:19.600]  videotaped some of the Bilderberg group arriving before the hotel was even completely shut
[16:19.600 --> 16:24.720]  down as the guests are leaving. One individual we believe is a Spanish government official.
[16:24.720 --> 16:27.560]  We know who he is. We've got to watch the video and confirm it all before we announce
[16:27.560 --> 16:32.320]  it. They play the national anthem of Spain. Some other people arrive. There's all these
[16:32.320 --> 16:37.760]  black SUVs and black Cadillacs and armored Cadillacs and State Department tags and big
[16:37.760 --> 16:45.560]  huge Ford trucks with cabs on the back with guys with MP five sub machine guns in the back.
[16:45.560 --> 16:53.040]  I then that morning of the Bilderberg group, a meeting beginning Thursday, I then went
[16:53.040 --> 17:00.960]  downstairs literally to buy some Gatorade in the gift shop. Now walking around the building
[17:00.960 --> 17:08.880]  on all the four floors, three floors, excuse me, I every room, every conference room was
[17:08.880 --> 17:13.040]  just filled with spooks and people with computers and equipment. So and they would always run
[17:13.040 --> 17:16.720]  out and question us. But I thought literally I was on a mission then I thought I'll just
[17:16.720 --> 17:26.240]  go into the into the gift shop and get some Gatorade and maybe newspaper and I'll walk
[17:26.240 --> 17:30.320]  in there. And there's a conference room and it says conference that's in the back. There's
[17:30.320 --> 17:33.840]  a door to a conference room in the back and it says conference room closed. The doors
[17:33.840 --> 17:39.640]  open part of the way and there's all these guys with shaved heads, but they all look
[17:39.640 --> 17:45.480]  like 45 to 55 years of age with a few women, few office women look like about 45 to 50
[17:45.480 --> 17:50.240]  milling around arguing about, well, you've got to bring in that satellite there and you
[17:50.240 --> 17:56.160]  got to run it through that telecom system. Well, in the army, we don't do it that way.
[17:56.160 --> 17:59.720]  We're, you know, the systems we have with a CMR QX nine or you know, they were using
[17:59.720 --> 18:04.000]  technical terms. That's a hypothetical one I just threw out, you know, you can't run
[18:04.000 --> 18:08.000]  that many feeds through it. Well, that's not how the Air Force does it. And we're running
[18:08.000 --> 18:11.920]  those feeds through right now. Hold on. I've got one of them. They're in this wing in the
[18:11.920 --> 18:19.040]  building right now. Put put our people on them. Is that guy part of our security detail?
[18:19.040 --> 18:22.480]  And so they had all the phones being listened to. They were tracking everybody and that
[18:22.480 --> 18:28.060]  was just one room. And I had a hidden camera that looked like a stick of bubblegum, a package
[18:28.060 --> 18:33.040]  of Wrigley's gum. It shoots really cruddy video because decent audio. So I flipped
[18:33.040 --> 18:38.520]  that on and did even catch part of it. They see me, they close the door, act like I'm
[18:38.520 --> 18:45.200]  browsing the different juices and things. I go over by that by newspaper, go back over.
[18:45.200 --> 18:50.320]  This is the type of stuff we have so much footage taken army just to go through it.
[18:50.320 --> 18:56.160]  All of these people are scrambling around all over the building. To make a long story
[18:56.160 --> 19:02.920]  short, we go and we get in our cars, we check out. As we start rolling out of the parking
[19:02.920 --> 19:11.400]  lot, a government plated, whatever the large new Dodge sedans are jets up right on our
[19:11.400 --> 19:19.080]  tail. A big SUV, a blue, dark blue SUV with flashing police lights pulls up with guys
[19:19.080 --> 19:24.800]  with MP5 submachine guns in front of us, seeing if it would scare us and make us run, looking
[19:24.800 --> 19:30.000]  at us with smiles on their faces. Two more big trucks come pulling up to block us. We
[19:30.000 --> 19:34.320]  just sit there staring at them for about a minute. They pull off, let us through. I'll
[19:34.320 --> 19:38.960]  tell you what happened after that when we get back. And Jim Tucker's coming up. I'm
[19:38.960 --> 19:43.440]  going to debrief everybody. I'm going to break it down here. I'm going to spill my
[19:43.440 --> 19:48.200]  guts and tell the story of what happened all the way down to my wife getting a vicious
[19:48.200 --> 19:54.000]  phone call yesterday afternoon. Stay with us.
[19:54.000 --> 19:57.960]  Hi, this is Alex Jones and I want to talk to you about the high price of gasoline. It's
[19:57.960 --> 20:02.520]  no secret that gasoline quality is poor, even though we're paying record prices at the pump.
[20:02.520 --> 20:06.960]  I have run across a company called SFR who has developed two products that improve gas
[20:06.960 --> 20:12.240]  mileage. Instead of paying a mechanic as much as $300 to clean your injection system, protect
[20:12.240 --> 20:17.960]  a complete fuel system treatment, cleans to 95% of new engine condition, improving mileage
[20:17.960 --> 20:22.480]  and only one tank full. Protect an engine treatment not only reduces friction, but it extends
[20:22.480 --> 20:26.920]  the life of your engine. Let's face it, with the high price of gasoline, it's time to take
[20:26.920 --> 20:32.080]  action. Purchase a protective fuel system treatment for only $9.95 and receive a free
[20:32.080 --> 20:38.080]  engine treatment, which is a $12.95 value free. Call triple eight, use SFR one. That
[20:38.080 --> 20:45.280]  number again is triple eight, use SFR one or check them out online at oilcompanysecret.com.
[20:45.280 --> 20:50.720]  That's oilcompanysecret.com. Satisfaction is guaranteed or your money back and it's safe
[20:50.720 --> 20:54.240]  for all cars. Act now.
[20:54.240 --> 20:58.680]  Now from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in internet history comes
[20:58.680 --> 21:04.920]  the long awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut, an entirely new two hour film that completely
[21:04.920 --> 21:09.640]  destroys the official fable forever. Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for
[21:09.640 --> 21:14.360]  a new independent investigation in which family members receive answers to their questions
[21:14.360 --> 21:18.880]  and the true perpetrators of the horrendous crime are brought to justice. Loose Change
[21:18.880 --> 21:24.360]  Final Cut is the ultimate 9-11 expose. From hijackers being trained at U.S. military bases
[21:24.360 --> 21:30.080]  to bombs in the buildings, Loose Change Final Cut is the one 9-11 film everyone must see.

[22:08.120 --> 22:12.760]  70% of China's one trillion reserves are in dollar, now purchasing 250,000 barrels of
[22:12.760 --> 22:18.480]  oil per day from Iran in Euro. Japanese refiners buy 550,000 barrels, switching dollar to yen.
[22:18.480 --> 22:22.880]  Bad news for US currency. China and Japan hold large positions in dollar. Trading equals
[22:22.880 --> 22:27.760]  permanent loss. Dollars fall into 65% of Euro. Erosion accelerates.
[22:27.760 --> 22:32.280]  Countries despise imperialistic policy of US. Loss of confidence causing more selling.
[22:32.280 --> 22:35.040]  GAO is warning about the debt spiraling out of control.

[22:52.920 --> 22:59.320]  Did you know the accumulation of acidic waste in the body is the single largest cause of
[22:59.320 --> 23:04.280]  disease such as cancer or diabetes? Acidic waste is created by the types of food we eat,
[23:04.280 --> 23:08.480]  what we drink, the environment and our high stress lifestyles. It's these choices that
[23:08.480 --> 23:13.240]  cause decreased energy, weight gain and eventually disease. The easiest way to reduce disease
[23:13.240 --> 23:18.440]  causing acidic waste is by drinking alkaline ionized water. At SnyderHealth.com we offer
[23:18.440 --> 23:23.160]  a full line of alkaline water ionizers from Jupiter Science, the leader in water ionization
[23:23.160 --> 23:29.840]  technology for over 25 years. Instantly transform ordinary tap water into clean, living, energized

[23:39.520 --> 23:44.280]  ionized water. Let SnyderHealth.com provide the water ionizer that's right for you and

[24:19.040 --> 24:26.600]  They are the elitists. They govern our planet. They are eugenicists. They are warmongers.
[24:26.600 --> 24:33.960]  They ride a black horse of death over the face of the planet, murdering with one to
[24:33.960 --> 24:42.080]  the bandit who will restrain them. They are the new world order. So we are trying to get
[24:42.080 --> 24:52.680]  out of the hotel now. It's about 150-yard drive out of the wooded complex from the main
[24:52.680 --> 25:03.640]  front of the building. This greenish-silver sedan, Dodge sedan is behind us with a shaved
[25:03.640 --> 25:11.520]  head type who, if I was assessing him, was about 35 years old, 36 years old, probably
[25:11.520 --> 25:16.120]  former Army Special Forces assigned to the State Department or the Pentagon Protective
[25:16.120 --> 25:22.320]  Services. We know they were out there, too. He gets right up on our tail. Then we turn.
[25:22.320 --> 25:27.200]  As we drive out, we already see about 80 demonstrators that had already shown up out there on the
[25:27.200 --> 25:32.560]  start of the Bilderberg conference. That was about 1150. They said we all had to be out
[25:32.560 --> 25:40.000]  by noon. We then turn down the road, drive, make more than 10 turns on the highway into
[25:40.000 --> 25:46.680]  a big shopping mall center. This guy follows us around and around, restaurants right behind
[25:46.680 --> 25:52.760]  us. At first, he dropped back and acted like he was turning and then got back on our tail.
[25:52.760 --> 25:56.240]  Not very good at what he was doing. We jump out of the car, videotape his face. He tries
[25:56.240 --> 26:04.000]  to cover his face up, got footage of all of this. We go put our gear in the Hilton Hotel
[26:04.000 --> 26:09.600]  a few miles away, come back. We bullhorn them. The Bilderberg group members start arriving
[26:09.600 --> 26:15.160]  in mass. Some had already arrived while we were inside before it officially started.
[26:15.160 --> 26:21.920]  They had Fairfax County police out there. They had, again, a bunch of different federal
[26:21.920 --> 26:32.000]  agencies out there. Several convoys of armored SUVs and armored Cadillacs came in. We later
[26:32.000 --> 26:38.560]  learned that was Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and also people from the State Department.
[26:38.560 --> 26:47.080]  There were people up in the cars that had their MP5 German submachine guns, assault
[26:47.080 --> 26:55.120]  rifles up, out. Not completely aimed at us, but partially out of the window aimed at us.
[26:55.120 --> 27:01.080]  We got some video of that. It's up on PrismPlanet.com today just looking at us with absolute hatred.
[27:01.080 --> 27:09.560]  How dare these peasantry come and actually try to cover and expose who runs their country.
[27:09.560 --> 27:17.000]  I would constantly have these huge military secret police types come up and say, man,
[27:17.000 --> 27:20.440]  we ought to engage in violence. We ought to take them on. We ought to do something. I
[27:20.440 --> 27:24.600]  would say, no, we're nonviolent. We're press here covering this. I'd go back to the hotel
[27:24.600 --> 27:28.520]  and people say, what's your identity? What do you plan to do? Do you want to go take
[27:28.520 --> 27:33.560]  on the State Department with me? Do you want to go into the State Department? Do you want
[27:33.560 --> 27:36.840]  to go into some federal buildings with me? I can take you. I'm just like, come on. How
[27:36.840 --> 27:43.200]  obvious is this? Of course, we knew by then that people in the last week had gone in and
[27:43.200 --> 27:46.400]  just videotaped the hotel and put it on YouTube. They'd gotten two different people that we
[27:46.400 --> 27:51.320]  interviewed and gotten State Department protective service visits at their homes. They then identified
[27:51.320 --> 27:55.920]  those same individuals there and we got video of them. They would walk up in the woods at
[27:55.920 --> 28:01.240]  the edge of the demonstrations and say to Adam and others, hey, Adam, watch yourself,
[28:01.240 --> 28:04.600]  watch out what you're doing, Adam. It was one fellow that had gotten some video that
[28:04.600 --> 28:10.200]  we posted again inside the hotel from a week and a half before, for a week before. So they
[28:10.200 --> 28:14.200]  were very, very upset. The Secret Service went over to the police repeatedly and told
[28:14.200 --> 28:18.680]  them, ban this protest, kick them off of here. Don't let them stay on the sidewalk. Then
[28:18.680 --> 28:25.760]  they tried to claim the sidewalk there off a major highway was the property of the Marriott
[28:25.760 --> 28:31.760]  the police then informed them that it wasn't the property. They put up police tape on the
[28:31.760 --> 28:40.760]  property line so that they could keep people from going over that line. It's a large hotel
[28:40.760 --> 28:46.120]  and in some areas it's as much as two, three acres off the road, but in some areas it's
[28:46.120 --> 28:51.120]  only 50 yards from the road through the trees. It just so happened that was where they were
[28:51.120 --> 28:56.720]  having some of their main conferences. And so we were bullhorning with some powerful bullhorns
[28:56.720 --> 29:02.760]  folks had and Richard in Haas, head of the CFR, stuck his head out and walked out. We
[29:02.760 --> 29:10.080]  saw Madeleine Albright go in. We saw Vernon Jordan going in. We saw Henry Kissinger going
[29:10.080 --> 29:19.240]  out. We saw Etienne Davignon, the head of the Bilderberg Group, Vice Count Etienne Davignon.
[29:19.240 --> 29:24.880]  We're going to go to Jim Tucker for his insight knowledge from his Bilderberg sources, major
[29:24.880 --> 29:29.760]  breaking exclusives here. Then I'll get into the rest of the story. People in clown masks
[29:29.760 --> 29:36.480]  following us, video of it, military photographing us, my wife being harassed. It's all coming
[29:36.480 --> 29:42.320]  up ladies and gentlemen. Absolute history being made in FullWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com.

[29:55.280 --> 30:00.320]  Do you know the truth about cancer treatments? Do you realize that with all presently accepted
[30:00.320 --> 30:06.160]  methods you are not correctly attacking the cancer and you are mostly fighting to survive
[30:06.160 --> 30:11.240]  the treatment? Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning and the poisoning of your
[30:11.240 --> 30:18.120]  entire system, are totally unnecessary? But now, it's cancer's turn to die. With

[33:42.720 --> 33:46.440]  care for it. Welcome back ladies and gentlemen. In the last 30 minutes I've been breaking
[33:46.440 --> 33:52.160]  down in chronological order some of the basics of what happened at Bilderberg 2008. We've
[33:52.160 --> 33:57.920]  gotten up until Thursday morning. I'll continue with that in the next hour after Jim Tucker
[33:57.920 --> 34:02.160]  leaves us. Jim has been covering Bilderberg for more than 35 years. He's attended more
[34:02.160 --> 34:07.160]  than 30 of the meetings. They last met in Chantilly, Virginia in 2002, planning the
[34:07.160 --> 34:14.000]  Iraq attack. They now, of course, met there in the last weekend of the weekend in Chantilly,
[34:14.000 --> 34:19.000]  Virginia to Westfields Marriott. Jim has sources inside Bilderberg, not members, but people
[34:19.000 --> 34:23.160]  that work for them. He also has other sources that we won't even basically give you an idea
[34:23.160 --> 34:28.920]  of where they're located. But his information has turned out to be extremely accurate and
[34:28.920 --> 34:33.720]  he's got ways of double checking in and getting it from multiple sources and cross referencing
[34:33.720 --> 34:38.240]  it and getting their minutes and their plans of what they're doing. He told me Saturday
[34:38.240 --> 34:42.040]  he'd talked to his source. They'd given him a bunch of info. He was going to personally
[34:42.040 --> 34:49.240]  meet with them Sunday afternoon at three o'clock. I saw him at about 11 a.m. as he was checking
[34:49.240 --> 34:54.480]  out of the hotel. And so I learned part of the story Saturday. And then now we haven't
[34:54.480 --> 34:58.200]  really reported that yet to him. And then we're going to give you the second part of
[34:58.200 --> 35:03.320]  the story, which I haven't even learned what he got from his source if he indeed met with
[35:03.320 --> 35:10.120]  them. It deals with Secretary Gates of Defense being there wanting the war with Iran, a bigger
[35:10.120 --> 35:15.880]  split than ever between the two groups, also where they stand on energy and oil prices.
[35:15.880 --> 35:20.520]  And then the new information that Jim may or may not have learned from his sources. Jim
[35:20.520 --> 35:25.440]  Tucker joining us from American Free Press, American Free Press dot net. Jim Tucker, first
[35:25.440 --> 35:29.400]  off, it was great seeing you again, my friend. And I think this was a very successful year.
[35:29.400 --> 35:35.360]  What do you think most definitely was successful in a much tribute goes to the protesters out
[35:35.360 --> 35:41.960]  front who I'm convinced without their noise and all those cameras wandering around the
[35:41.960 --> 35:51.240]  boom boxes cameras from TV cameras from small stations broadcast radio broadcasters from
[35:51.240 --> 35:55.600]  small stations and a few newspaper men from small newspapers. Big ones aren't allowed
[35:55.600 --> 36:00.920]  to do it. But the Bilderberg became aware that they'd be positively identified through
[36:00.920 --> 36:07.280]  the internet and small media. And I think that's when they decided they had to cough
[36:07.280 --> 36:16.200]  up the list. Now, of course, the list is never complete. That's why all this personal observation
[36:16.200 --> 36:23.440]  Robert Gates was positively identified going in to Bilderberg confirmed inside by our source.
[36:23.440 --> 36:30.760]  When he made his pitch for war, the is not on the list. I'm still trying to find out
[36:30.760 --> 36:37.040]  positively whether Barack Obama was there. He may very well have been. All right, the
[36:37.040 --> 36:43.560]  latest I've got, if anything, in this next edition, but a great tribute goes to those
[36:43.560 --> 36:49.920]  raised patriotic. Two are thundering at the gates of Bilderberg.
[36:49.920 --> 36:58.280]  Jim, break down what you told me Saturday about the source and what was discussed. Are
[36:58.280 --> 37:03.000]  they going to attack Iran? What the debates were? What was being said?
[37:03.000 --> 37:12.680]  The Europeans were generally opposed to an invasion of Iran. The gates made the regular
[37:12.680 --> 37:21.680]  drill, war propaganda drill about how Iran is a nuclear threat to everybody. Incidentally,
[37:21.680 --> 37:26.480]  that very moment, the heads of state from Iran and Iraq were having a friendly discussion
[37:26.480 --> 37:36.560]  about mutual protection. And obviously, Iran has no nuclear weapons. The Europeans were
[37:36.560 --> 37:44.560]  making snide comments such as where does Iran keep us new for your weapons in Saddam Hussein's
[37:44.560 --> 37:57.000]  tomb. But most Europeans, and I believe some Americans were opposed to an invasion of Iran.
[37:57.000 --> 38:05.160]  And we can only hope that President Bush will not choose his last few months in office to
[38:05.160 --> 38:13.440]  start another war that he'll have to leave to successor to stop the bleeding.
[38:13.440 --> 38:18.960]  So gauging this from past years, you knew in 2002, even though the Washington Post was
[38:18.960 --> 38:23.640]  there, they lied and said it would be in the summer or fall of 2002. You said, no, that's
[38:23.640 --> 38:28.640]  this info for my sources. They're going to attack in March of 03. You were spot on there.
[38:28.640 --> 38:36.040]  Is it not as clear this time if they are or aren't going to attack Iran? No, because Gates
[38:36.040 --> 38:40.000]  is unable to promise that the next president of the United States will attack Iran. But
[38:40.000 --> 38:46.080]  he also did not say the United States would not attack Iran sometime between now and January
[38:46.080 --> 38:52.800]  of the 20th and at high noon when Bush is no longer able to order an attack on Iran.
[38:52.800 --> 38:57.360]  Actually, he's not allowed to anyway under the Constitution, but we've forgotten about
[38:57.360 --> 39:02.800]  declaring war since Korea. We've forgotten that Congress only Congress can declare war
[39:02.800 --> 39:08.560]  since Korea. So Jim, are you saying it looks like they are going or at least the administration
[39:08.560 --> 39:16.640]  is still considering to attack Iran? The administration is still considering attacking Iran. We can
[39:16.640 --> 39:23.320]  surely hope that they are successfully pressured out of it. Now you were telling me there at
[39:23.320 --> 39:29.360]  the restaurant Saturday night that it looked like the split was even bigger this time against
[39:29.360 --> 39:35.800]  war from the European versus Anglo-American faction. Can you give us any idea on the split
[39:35.800 --> 39:42.280]  numbers? Oh, I would say at least 90% of the Europeans
[39:42.280 --> 39:48.640]  opposed war, probably closer to 100%. There's no European stuff. So go ahead and attack
[39:48.640 --> 39:56.320]  Iran that would be good for the world. Most of the Americans were passive differential
[39:56.320 --> 40:03.680]  to the Secretary of Defense and to Condoleezza Rice's also major standard, nothing off the
[40:03.680 --> 40:12.760]  table pitch in so far as Iran is concerned. But quite likely some of them had great reservations
[40:12.760 --> 40:16.920]  themselves, even in the American group, even though they could not, they dare not be as
[40:16.920 --> 40:23.000]  visible. It is loud about it. What's your gut in analyzing the sources
[40:23.000 --> 40:27.520]  information in years past? Do you think they're going to attack Iran?
[40:27.520 --> 40:34.040]  I just don't know. I wish I could say with confidence that they will not. I'd hate to
[40:34.040 --> 40:38.720]  have to say with confidence that they will. I really don't know. I would think now maybe
[40:38.720 --> 40:45.520]  it's like 50-50, but Iran is attacked this year because it is very in the coming of an
[40:45.520 --> 40:52.120]  outgoing president in the last few months of his term to start a war that he knows would
[40:52.120 --> 40:57.560]  have to be passed on to a successor, whoever that successor may be. And if the John McCain
[40:57.560 --> 41:05.360]  is a successor, of course, the invasion of Iran would continue also as well as the invasions
[41:05.360 --> 41:12.920]  of Iraq and Afghanistan. Any other points concerning war that were
[41:12.920 --> 41:16.720]  made? No, I think that just about does it. I'm
[41:16.720 --> 41:20.720]  still going through. Okay. I want to get into energy in a minute,
[41:20.720 --> 41:25.560]  but let's get to that later. Did you have your second meeting with one of the sources
[41:25.560 --> 41:29.920]  Sunday? Yes, I was by arrangement and I got back
[41:29.920 --> 41:35.080]  to my hotel. Please give us a briefing, Jim Tucker, AmericanFreePress.net. Tell us what
[41:35.080 --> 41:39.160]  else your source said. Any new information on other subjects?
[41:39.160 --> 41:49.880]  It's a little bit ominous. Under the heading of resisting terrorism, there are points made
[41:49.880 --> 41:58.600]  about how the terrorist organizations are recruiting people who do not look like terrorists
[41:58.600 --> 42:06.120]  like red-haired freckleface boys, blonde blue-eyed boys. They're searching hard for those types
[42:06.120 --> 42:15.200]  to become the new mad bombers, so that they will not fall into suspicion that with someone
[42:15.200 --> 42:21.000]  who's definitely Middle Eastern with a turban. So it's basically more of the fake white al-Qaeda.
[42:21.000 --> 42:25.480]  Now all the American people are al-Qaeda. We're all under suspicion, total bull.
[42:25.480 --> 42:30.440]  And they're discussing microchips. Let me stop you. They're discussing putting
[42:30.440 --> 42:35.600]  microchips in us? Jim, this is big news. Tell us what you heard.
[42:35.600 --> 42:45.040]  One of the speakers pointed out that microchips now are put in under drawers so that everywhere
[42:45.040 --> 42:52.360]  a fellow walks in under drawers, so I think Walmart's doing that. That's a market study.
[42:52.360 --> 42:55.240]  So they were admitting that RFID is part of their tracking group?
[42:55.240 --> 43:00.840]  Yes, so now with the microchip, they can decide, you're not a terrorist, you're a good guy
[43:00.840 --> 43:08.480]  right away. Speed up the lines of the airport because they can zap your microchip and find
[43:08.480 --> 43:11.520]  out that you've never even gotten a speeding ticket, you're a good guy.
[43:11.520 --> 43:15.840]  So specifically, what are they saying about microchips? Obviously, they want their cashless
[43:15.840 --> 43:19.720]  grid in, so Alex Jones is on the no fly list. People that don't like the new world order
[43:19.720 --> 43:23.680]  can't even get a job, and basically all their minion slaves can't.
[43:23.680 --> 43:29.480]  Well, everything would be on the microchip, your illnesses. And again, we're talking about
[43:29.480 --> 43:35.400]  the same old saw about how this will save lives. You could hit by a car, you're unconscious,
[43:35.400 --> 43:38.800]  it takes you to the hospital, they cannot communicate with you, but they can tell the
[43:38.800 --> 43:42.640]  physician that you're on these medications, you have this medical history, which will
[43:42.640 --> 43:47.640]  help these emergency room physicians know how to treat you and maybe save your life.
[43:47.640 --> 43:50.720]  Jim, I want to be clear, they were saying all this and they're talking about implanted
[43:50.720 --> 43:54.720]  chips or are they talking about just in our clothing?
[43:54.720 --> 44:00.480]  Planted chips because you may change underwear. Now, you know that we told everybody five
[44:00.480 --> 44:03.880]  years ago they were going to make the troops take it, it's now happening, it's now mainstream
[44:03.880 --> 44:08.560]  news, so you're telling me they were saying, quote, they wanted to accelerate getting chips
[44:08.560 --> 44:12.960]  in us or what were they saying? Yes, that would be the conclusion from the
[44:12.960 --> 44:19.480]  friendly discussion about how helpful these would be, first in getting tourists out of
[44:19.480 --> 44:24.800]  the lines of the airport and speeding up the lines, people like that, they get through
[44:24.800 --> 44:31.280]  the airport quickly now with a microchip and then the other benefits that I just mentioned
[44:31.280 --> 44:37.760]  and the heritage, this goes all the way back at least to the Ronald Reagan years when now
[44:37.760 --> 44:44.760]  Senator from North Carolina, Elizabeth Dole, was Reagan's Secretary of Transportation and
[44:44.760 --> 44:49.520]  I asked her this at a reception and asked her this question twice. She was advocating
[44:49.520 --> 44:56.480]  at that time, much more innocent than what we're talking about today, but at the time
[44:56.480 --> 45:03.120]  it was also rather disturbing. She made a very good point that big rigged truck drivers
[45:03.120 --> 45:09.640]  can lose their license for rear-ending a Volkswagen and killing three nuns lose their
[45:09.640 --> 45:16.280]  license and one state has got seven or eight more licenses to go, so if we had a universal
[45:16.280 --> 45:24.440]  database that identified every license, so that if you have a platform license in Virginia,
[45:24.440 --> 45:27.880]  they found out you already have one in Iowa, you don't get a Virginia license, so you
[45:27.880 --> 45:33.000]  surrender your Iowa license and that would get all these big rigged truck drivers who
[45:33.000 --> 45:39.600]  kill people off the roads, but then she volunteered the collateral benefits, which would mean
[45:39.600 --> 45:46.720]  that the database would contain all your medical history, all your personal history, and how
[45:46.720 --> 45:49.120]  many times you use McDonald's and everything.
[45:49.120 --> 45:54.160]  Yes, so all your purchases, everything you do in an NSA, National Reconnaissance Office
[45:54.160 --> 45:59.120]  database, it was only about a quarter mile from the National Reconnaissance headquarters,
[45:59.120 --> 46:04.440]  basically a subsidiary of the National Security Agency. Jim, let me then get this straight
[46:04.440 --> 46:08.520]  and make sure I'm correct here. Obviously, they were talking about their excuses for
[46:08.520 --> 46:14.080]  making us all take microchips, but the key is it's a control grid, and the message is
[46:14.080 --> 46:18.800]  there's wide al-Qaeda, the American people are all potential al-Qaeda, totally made up,
[46:18.800 --> 46:22.320]  we've seen them putting that PR stunt out, and we know they're pushing to make their
[46:22.320 --> 46:25.880]  personnel take chips first, then they'll say, well, I've got to have a chip, I'm going
[46:25.880 --> 46:30.360]  to enforce on you, just like the Mexican Attorney General, making his staff take it.
[46:30.360 --> 46:32.960]  Yes, that seems to be the plan.
[46:32.960 --> 46:39.080]  And was this in a sidebar conference room, or was this a main discussion in the main hall?
[46:39.080 --> 46:41.320]  It was a main hall discussion.
[46:41.320 --> 46:46.840]  Now, Jim, did you hear anything from your sources about our bullhorning the conference
[46:46.840 --> 46:51.480]  rooms, because we found spots to bullhorn from only 50 yards away, their conference rooms
[46:51.480 --> 46:56.760]  and fellow brought in a giant industrial megaphone that literally, ladies and gentlemen, you
[46:56.760 --> 47:01.080]  could announce to an entire football stadium with, and the windows were shaking. Did you
[47:01.080 --> 47:05.160]  hear anything about that, because they looked very upset when they were driving out, Vernon
[47:05.160 --> 47:08.400]  Jordan was looking at me with hatred, others were looking at me, they were holding their
[47:08.400 --> 47:12.760]  MP5s up at me, they looked so angry.
[47:12.760 --> 47:16.680]  You know, I wish I'd asked that question, I didn't, it needed to volunteer any information
[47:16.680 --> 47:23.560]  on it, but I agree with you, I'm sure that you appear some Bill Bergears, I wish to
[47:23.560 --> 47:26.000]  hell I'd thought to ask that question.
[47:26.000 --> 47:31.160]  Okay, what else did your source tell you, just the new microchip info, or what else
[47:31.160 --> 47:32.880]  did they hear?
[47:32.880 --> 47:37.400]  That was about it, the microchip thing was the only subject for it.
[47:37.400 --> 47:41.920]  So basically they want their cashless society tracking surveillance grid and they were admitting
[47:41.920 --> 47:43.960]  it would track every purchase, everything we did.
[47:43.960 --> 47:48.440]  That's the capacity of the microchip which they were advocating.
[47:48.440 --> 47:49.440]  Think, Jim.
[47:49.440 --> 47:51.800]  All for our own good.
[47:51.800 --> 47:55.040]  Of course. Jim, anything else the source said?
[47:55.040 --> 47:59.640]  No, that's about it.
[47:59.640 --> 48:01.680]  I wish I had more information.
[48:01.680 --> 48:03.160]  This is very powerful info.
[48:03.160 --> 48:08.400]  As I go through the D-half of this, I may find something else, but...
[48:08.400 --> 48:09.400]  Do you have the notes in front of you?
[48:09.400 --> 48:12.840]  We've got one more second, maybe you can scan over them.
[48:12.840 --> 48:17.320]  Jim, what about oil, what about oil prices?
[48:17.320 --> 48:21.760]  The news is reporting today it's going to go to $150 a barrel by the end of summer,
[48:21.760 --> 48:23.600]  that's out of Reuters.
[48:23.600 --> 48:24.760]  What's going on on energy?
[48:24.760 --> 48:30.920]  We know you said two years ago, they plan to have it to be $140 a barrel by the summer,
[48:30.920 --> 48:32.040]  they've reached that goal.
[48:32.040 --> 48:33.480]  What are they saying now?
[48:33.480 --> 48:41.840]  Well, this could be good news as I think we've discussed earlier on all the European
[48:41.840 --> 49:01.600]  raised the issue of the question of Jeff, should we put a lid on the rise in oil prices?
[49:01.600 --> 49:03.560]  Are we reaching the point of diminishing returns?
[49:03.560 --> 49:12.200]  To use the term diminishing returns, mattering about how Americans jumped out of their gas
[49:12.200 --> 49:21.480]  hog SUVs and so forth and called after small cars, Ford gave away the SUVs that were traded
[49:21.480 --> 49:28.600]  in, are there new SUVs, so they've shut down those plants and are not making them anymore?
[49:28.600 --> 49:30.760]  He said that won't be easy to turn around.
[49:30.760 --> 49:36.760]  He said the Americans allegedly accepted gas at $3 a gallon, at $4 a gallon.
[49:36.760 --> 49:42.200]  People who switched to public transportation, many of them will stay on the bus or stay
[49:42.200 --> 49:50.400]  on the train, rather than come back to their automobile if prices stay above $4 a gallon.
[49:50.400 --> 49:56.600]  Yep, the economists outside of Bilderberger are predicting $5 a gallon gas this summer
[49:56.600 --> 50:04.280]  and as you said the price of oil going above $150 a barrel, well we know from five years
[50:04.280 --> 50:12.880]  ago that they were able to generate the increase of oil to above $140 a barrel in a time when
[50:12.880 --> 50:18.160]  it's only $40 a barrel and we can hope they have the same power to limit their mischief
[50:18.160 --> 50:26.920]  by putting a lid quickly on the increase in oil prices.
[50:26.920 --> 50:34.080]  So they're squeezing so hard it might be irrevocably hurting their slaves, output to
[50:34.080 --> 50:35.080]  them.
[50:35.080 --> 50:40.640]  Well they made the point in response to a question of the typical question, other Europeans
[50:40.640 --> 50:46.360]  have paid $8 a gallon for oil, they've paid a lot more for oil for a lot of years and
[50:46.360 --> 50:52.080]  the response of not only are Americans our biggest consumers but we're differently the
[50:52.080 --> 50:53.080]  cat anyway.
[50:53.080 --> 50:54.520]  Stay there Jim, take a break.
[50:54.520 --> 50:58.760]  It is a big idea, a new world order.
[50:58.760 --> 51:03.360]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[51:03.360 --> 51:09.320]  It's known as the Bilderberg, could their objective be world domination?
[51:09.320 --> 51:14.720]  For thousands of years their dark order grew, now as they hail the birth of the new world
[51:14.720 --> 51:22.840]  order their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[51:22.840 --> 51:27.840]  For the first time in history the elites plan for world government is blown wide open.
[51:27.840 --> 51:32.160]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire new world order agenda.
[51:32.160 --> 51:34.840]  Bilderberg is making great progress toward a world government.
[51:34.840 --> 51:37.960]  Most people have no idea, they're not after money, they have all the money they need,
[51:37.960 --> 51:40.160]  they're after power, that's their affidavit.
[51:40.160 --> 51:46.040]  For more information visit our website at www.prisonplanet.com or www.infowars.com or watch it online right
[51:46.040 --> 52:14.560]  now at www.prisonplanet.tv.
[52:14.560 --> 52:18.600]  This is a story certain sailors have been threatened never to tell.
[52:18.600 --> 52:25.120]  It happened June 8, 1967 in international waters off the Sinai Peninsula in the Mediterranean
[52:25.120 --> 52:26.120]  Sea.
[52:26.120 --> 52:31.840]  A two hour attack killing 34 Americans and wounding 171 others.
[52:31.840 --> 52:38.160]  The United States Navy ship should have sunk with 821 rocket and machine gun holes in it.
[52:38.160 --> 52:43.880]  Having been bombed with napalm and a 40 foot wide hole created by the deadly torpedo blast
[52:43.880 --> 52:46.040]  in the starboard side.
[52:46.040 --> 52:50.200]  Left for dead the ship and crew was not helped by their own Navy.
[52:50.200 --> 52:51.200]  Get this.
[52:51.200 --> 52:55.440]  The President and Secretary of State call back fighter planes that were on their way to help
[52:55.440 --> 52:56.440]  them.
[52:56.440 --> 52:59.480]  Can't be you say oh yeah and it gets worse.
[52:59.480 --> 53:04.640]  When the bloody dying crippled crew and ship miraculously made it to port, the Navy high
[53:04.640 --> 53:10.080]  command threatened court-martial and worse if they ever told what was done to them and
[53:10.080 --> 53:13.640]  particularly who did it to them.
[53:13.640 --> 53:20.520]  We even risk having it told to you, but we tell you if you go to another untoldstory.com.
[53:20.520 --> 53:25.520]  Told by one of the surviving sailors himself and then he directs you to a website that
[53:25.520 --> 53:26.720]  tells it all.

[53:54.640 --> 54:13.760]  Jim Tucker, Jim do you have those notes in front of you, do you say you do have those
[54:13.760 --> 54:14.760]  notes, Jim?
[54:14.760 --> 54:15.760]  Yep.
[54:15.760 --> 54:19.640]  No, I'm still trying to thank you in the notes.
[54:19.640 --> 54:26.640]  Okay let's go ahead and cut that music now, Jim, I mean there's so much to talk about,
[54:26.640 --> 54:27.640]  so much to discuss.
[54:27.640 --> 54:30.280]  You were finishing up with the oil discussion.
[54:30.280 --> 54:36.960]  Yes, we can hope for all those reasons, the Bilderberg for their own selfish reasons not
[54:36.960 --> 54:41.880]  part of kinder loving care for the one million people starving death partly because of the
[54:41.880 --> 54:49.620]  oil prices and of course I said so often the high cost of transportation from raw material
[54:49.620 --> 54:57.560]  to finished product to marketplaces driving food prices crazy they're telling us in the
[54:57.560 --> 55:03.840]  establishment press one million people on this earth are starving that's one out one
[55:03.840 --> 55:09.560]  billion with a B that's one out of seven people on earth but we also have hungry people in
[55:09.560 --> 55:16.040]  our cities especially the poor inner city, negro communities for the old women having
[55:16.040 --> 55:20.440]  to pay a outrageous amount for apartment rent takes up most of our social security check
[55:20.440 --> 55:29.440]  with the cost of food these days, so she eats for the last week of the month waiting for
[55:29.440 --> 55:34.880]  the social security check or does she take her medications, those kind of choices she
[55:34.880 --> 55:38.160]  had to give her a little kitty away which is very comfortable because she can no longer
[55:38.160 --> 55:45.840]  afford cat food which is just a terribly heart-rending situation.
[55:45.840 --> 55:54.400]  Not one major US newspaper and even the Fairfax Times one of the reporters came out Thursday
[55:54.400 --> 55:58.520]  she said she wanted to do a report but they may not let her obviously they didn't and
[55:58.520 --> 56:03.600]  one never came out she said would come out on Saturday or Sunday this is a total blackout
[56:03.600 --> 56:08.160]  you said that they normally every five years are in the North America but now they came
[56:08.160 --> 56:11.840]  back after two years and you said that was because they think the press is more controlled
[56:11.840 --> 56:16.160]  here it would have been in the European news that's a shame for our so-called media the
[56:16.160 --> 56:20.920]  control corporate media give me your take on the fact there's been a total mainstream
[56:20.920 --> 56:21.920]  media blackout.
[56:21.920 --> 56:30.520]  Well those who attended such as Donald Graham and the Washington Post and those kids from
[56:30.520 --> 56:38.280]  the financial times I think it is all those and we're going to identify them this week
[56:38.280 --> 56:45.520]  by their name and their association their newspaper our broadcast outlet they are journalistic
[56:45.520 --> 56:49.960]  whores and this comes from an old boy who's been twenty-half years for the establishment
[56:49.960 --> 56:54.680]  newspapers after being in journal Washington daily news there's been times of dispatch
[56:54.680 --> 57:01.360]  and others and they are whores and I've just mentioned they're good boys I'm not even
[57:01.360 --> 57:07.720]  being critical incidentally Jimmy Lee Hogan was not there this year he's not on the list
[57:07.720 --> 57:11.880]  and that's one of the reasons why we double check because he's coming in so we can know
[57:11.880 --> 57:18.000]  who's there who's not on the list even if we get the list as we did but he was in Europe
[57:18.000 --> 57:25.480]  somewhere most certainly is only about two times that he's missed Bilderberg in decades
[57:25.480 --> 57:33.160]  of course little Donnie Graham was there like he's programmed to be there's not been a Bilderberg
[57:33.160 --> 57:39.600]  meeting since 1954 without the publisher the Washington Post being there Jim we're going

[57:53.280 --> 57:57.760]  covered up of this very important event the reason they're losing their entire market
[57:57.760 --> 58:08.000]  share and the mainstream media is becoming obsolete that's part of it yes we're going
[58:08.000 --> 58:11.200]  to break Jim stay there you've got a one minute break so I don't think you have time to run

[1:01:26.240 --> 1:01:32.960]  uh... for this information be forced into the public dialogue and i'm sure that uh...

[1:01:46.440 --> 1:01:47.720]  people coming up to us
[1:01:47.720 --> 1:01:51.360]  asking if you wanted to carry out violence that we later see them back on the grounds
[1:01:51.360 --> 1:01:53.280]  so we confirm that it was
[1:01:53.280 --> 1:01:56.000]  uh... different federal forces international forces
[1:01:56.000 --> 1:02:00.080]  trying to provocateur which is illegal trying to lead us in violent actions
[1:02:00.080 --> 1:02:02.920]  uh... give me your uh... take on that
[1:02:02.920 --> 1:02:07.280]  well when you're are aware of it it can be a little fun to remember that night
[1:02:07.280 --> 1:02:11.160]  uh... in the bar where you've whispered my ear that the guy sitting next to me
[1:02:11.160 --> 1:02:12.280]  uh...
[1:02:12.280 --> 1:02:16.360]  was a belterberg stooge i think he said he's with the secret services something
[1:02:16.360 --> 1:02:18.160]  so uh...
[1:02:18.160 --> 1:02:21.280]  after that all they were wearing of course the kids are coming over to get in
[1:02:21.280 --> 1:02:25.000]  literature which is graciously accepting in the
[1:02:25.000 --> 1:02:25.720]  busy
[1:02:25.720 --> 1:02:28.600]  something is faith
[1:02:28.600 --> 1:02:33.200]  uh... turn the conversation with my good friend trish you saw us out there
[1:02:33.200 --> 1:02:35.440]  and uh...
[1:02:35.440 --> 1:02:38.880]  we talked about
[1:02:38.880 --> 1:02:42.000]  uh... henry christiger's
[1:02:42.000 --> 1:02:44.040]  uh... tremendous
[1:02:44.040 --> 1:02:45.720]  instance of flatulence
[1:02:45.720 --> 1:02:48.400]  well we have no idea that we're having a bizarre stick out
[1:02:48.400 --> 1:02:50.120]  and uh...
[1:02:50.120 --> 1:02:53.640]  which is a bunch of nonsense for his ears just to
[1:02:53.640 --> 1:02:55.560]  uh... see them stick out
[1:02:55.560 --> 1:02:56.720]  so you can have fun with those
[1:02:56.720 --> 1:02:58.200]  uh... kids
[1:02:58.200 --> 1:03:00.440]  even though they're stalking you
[1:03:00.440 --> 1:03:03.680]  well there were a lot of them out there after you left sunday morning we were
[1:03:03.680 --> 1:03:04.920]  back out there
[1:03:04.920 --> 1:03:08.200]  and they were following us around driving around taking our photos in in
[1:03:08.200 --> 1:03:09.320]  uh... federal
[1:03:09.320 --> 1:03:10.520]  cars
[1:03:10.520 --> 1:03:13.520]  and uh... we were trying to videotape them so next they drove back by and
[1:03:13.520 --> 1:03:14.920]  clown mask
[1:03:14.920 --> 1:03:18.040]  and then we uh... we've got to check the video we were zooming in we believe we
[1:03:18.040 --> 1:03:18.680]  got it
[1:03:18.680 --> 1:03:22.200]  then parked in the parking lot walking back in the belterberg wearing clown
[1:03:22.200 --> 1:03:24.160]  mask jim
[1:03:24.160 --> 1:03:27.600]  well somehow seems appropriate for them where clown mask
[1:03:27.600 --> 1:03:30.560]  jim you've got big reports coming up this week american free press dot net
[1:03:30.560 --> 1:03:31.360]  don't you
[1:03:31.360 --> 1:03:35.960]  oh yes and uh... course in the transition will be the mail friday
[1:03:35.960 --> 1:03:39.800]  anything else uh... you would think we need to add the last sixty-second sir
[1:03:39.800 --> 1:03:42.200]  uh... i can't think of anything
[1:03:42.200 --> 1:03:46.920]  well big news here on the factors an even bigger split on the attack on iran
[1:03:46.920 --> 1:03:48.480]  still could be in the offing
[1:03:48.480 --> 1:03:52.360]  we see mainstream reports that bush may strike quote of obama's elected
[1:03:52.360 --> 1:03:54.240]  uh... before he leaves office
[1:03:54.240 --> 1:03:57.480]  uh... we know that uh... they certainly are split on whether they should jack of
[1:03:57.480 --> 1:03:58.560]  oil prices or not
[1:03:58.560 --> 1:04:01.600]  but they were pretty much unified on jacking them up two years ago what they
[1:04:01.600 --> 1:04:02.280]  jim
[1:04:02.280 --> 1:04:03.360]  uh... uh...
[1:04:03.360 --> 1:04:05.800]  well yes they were uh...
[1:04:05.800 --> 1:04:08.200]  but on that with great enthusiasm
[1:04:08.200 --> 1:04:10.120]  and uh...
[1:04:10.120 --> 1:04:13.720]  opposite just that universal approval for jack up all prices
[1:04:13.720 --> 1:04:15.440]  they're able to order the
[1:04:15.440 --> 1:04:17.460]  possible up they can order it down
[1:04:17.460 --> 1:04:18.960]  and i hope they do
[1:04:18.960 --> 1:04:21.400]  or at least we're talking about putting a little it not
[1:04:21.400 --> 1:04:23.080]  mister down but
[1:04:23.080 --> 1:04:24.840]  restraining the rest
[1:04:24.840 --> 1:04:26.320]  which means
[1:04:26.320 --> 1:04:28.200]  uh... at least not making
[1:04:28.200 --> 1:04:32.040]  bad situation even worse
[1:04:32.040 --> 1:04:36.000]  jim talker jim talker thank you so much for spending time with us and it was

[1:08:20.560 --> 1:08:22.560]  Alright, we're back live ladies and gentlemen
[1:08:22.560 --> 1:08:25.560]  I want to, now that we've got them to the point of Thursday
[1:08:25.560 --> 1:08:28.560]  because in the first 30 minutes those who just joined us have broke down
[1:08:28.560 --> 1:08:31.560]  from getting there Tuesday up until Thursday morning
[1:08:31.560 --> 1:08:34.560]  and I'm going to continue with a basic breakdown of what happened
[1:08:34.560 --> 1:08:38.560]  in the five days that we were there but before we do that
[1:08:38.560 --> 1:08:43.560]  I want to play this clip from CNN of footage of the fact that
[1:08:43.560 --> 1:08:46.560]  they basically locked the reporters on the plane to Chicago
[1:08:46.560 --> 1:08:52.560]  and then Obama jumped off in Virginia in DC
[1:08:52.560 --> 1:08:55.560]  and then disappeared into multiple secret meetings
[1:08:55.560 --> 1:09:01.560]  now I was sitting there Thursday night as all of this was happening
[1:09:01.560 --> 1:09:04.560]  and we were watching CNN in the hotel and they were reporting
[1:09:04.560 --> 1:09:08.560]  he was at multiple secret meetings then they said he was at Hillary's house
[1:09:08.560 --> 1:09:11.560]  the media all camped out there then it was Diane Feinstein's house
[1:09:11.560 --> 1:09:16.560]  another meeting and the MO we've got is that they did go to the Bilderberg group
[1:09:16.560 --> 1:09:19.560]  and there was massive activity that Thursday afternoon
[1:09:19.560 --> 1:09:23.560]  in the hour and a half after he got off the plane and disappeared
[1:09:23.560 --> 1:09:26.560]  so I want to go ahead and play that audio right now
[1:09:26.560 --> 1:09:29.560]  this is on board the plane with Obama's press secretary
[1:09:29.560 --> 1:09:32.560]  they're trying to diffuse where he's gone
[1:09:32.560 --> 1:09:36.560]  and where he admits he's going to multiple secret meetings
[1:09:36.560 --> 1:09:38.560]  going to the king makers to be approved
[1:09:38.560 --> 1:09:40.560]  here's the clip
[1:09:40.560 --> 1:09:42.560]  the presumptive nominees in the past has always been that they have
[1:09:42.560 --> 1:09:44.560]  at least a press pool with them at all times
[1:09:44.560 --> 1:09:48.560]  is there a reason why we didn't go with him in the motorcade all the way
[1:09:48.560 --> 1:09:52.560]  this is what we're out here for now we're on this plane with no candidate
[1:09:52.560 --> 1:10:01.560]  look I understand that there was a desire to do these meetings obviously in private
[1:10:01.560 --> 1:10:05.560]  and that's what we're doing here tonight
[1:10:05.560 --> 1:10:09.560]  it wasn't an attempt to deceive in any way
[1:10:09.560 --> 1:10:11.560]  stop right there
[1:10:11.560 --> 1:10:14.560]  back it up about 10 seconds not an attempt to deceive in any way
[1:10:14.560 --> 1:10:19.560]  to be clear they landed Virginia they tell them Obama's going to get right back on
[1:10:19.560 --> 1:10:23.560]  and this has been admitted mainstream controlled press even admits it
[1:10:23.560 --> 1:10:27.560]  and then they locked the plane down and took off with them to Chicago
[1:10:27.560 --> 1:10:29.560]  okay quote there was a desire
[1:10:29.560 --> 1:10:33.560]  presumptive nominees in the past has always been that they have at least a press pool with them at all times
[1:10:33.560 --> 1:10:37.560]  is there a reason why we didn't go with him in the motorcade all the way
[1:10:37.560 --> 1:10:41.560]  stop right there stop right I think we're fast forward and rewinding the tape
[1:10:41.560 --> 1:10:45.560]  let's just rewind it back to the start and start in a moment in just a second
[1:10:45.560 --> 1:10:47.560]  okay I wanted people to hear this unedited
[1:10:47.560 --> 1:10:52.560]  okay this clips up on CNN.com if you want to go watch it we'll give you the title of it later
[1:10:52.560 --> 1:10:58.560]  but the point is that listen oh there's no attempt to deceive well he's deceiving right there
[1:10:58.560 --> 1:11:03.560]  they lock him on the plane in America and they fly him to Chicago four states away
[1:11:03.560 --> 1:11:09.560]  now this is what happens in the United States because there was a desire for him to be able to attend secret meetings
[1:11:09.560 --> 1:11:11.560]  okay do you understand?
[1:11:11.560 --> 1:11:16.560]  then they gave out two different meetings they were at and said he was at other meetings in the next few days
[1:11:16.560 --> 1:11:18.560]  we believe he was in Bilderberg
[1:11:18.560 --> 1:11:23.560]  but we don't get to know because in America the press gets tricked onto airplanes
[1:11:23.560 --> 1:11:26.560]  and flown to another state
[1:11:26.560 --> 1:11:29.560]  which basically is kidnapping here it is
[1:11:29.560 --> 1:11:33.560]  the junctive nominees in the past has always been that they have at least a press pool with them at all times
[1:11:33.560 --> 1:11:37.560]  is there a reason why we didn't go with him in the motorcade all the way
[1:11:37.560 --> 1:11:41.560]  this is what we're out here for and now we're on this plane with no candidate
[1:11:41.560 --> 1:11:45.560]  you know he look I understand that he
[1:11:45.560 --> 1:11:50.560]  there was a desire to do these meetings obviously in private
[1:11:50.560 --> 1:11:54.560]  and you know that's what we're doing here tonight
[1:11:54.560 --> 1:12:00.560]  and you know it wasn't an attempt to deceive in any way it's just private meetings
[1:12:00.560 --> 1:12:04.560]  the decision of the press corps when there is a general election candidate
[1:12:04.560 --> 1:12:08.560]  and right now it is a general election is that they're treated the same way the president is
[1:12:08.560 --> 1:12:11.560]  if the president goes bike riding we go with him
[1:12:11.560 --> 1:12:17.560]  if he goes out to dinner or goes to visit a friend three blocks up the road we go with him in the motorcade
[1:12:17.560 --> 1:12:21.560]  and you know that's the expectation in a general election
[1:12:21.560 --> 1:12:25.560]  that's the way it's been with previous candidates Don Kerry, George Bush
[1:12:25.560 --> 1:12:29.560]  you know when he ran that's the way it's done so
[1:12:29.560 --> 1:12:33.560]  why are we diverging from that and you know we would have been happy to sit on the runway
[1:12:33.560 --> 1:12:37.560]  we didn't have anything better to do other than do what we're paying
[1:12:37.560 --> 1:12:41.560]  to fly this plane for which is to cover the candidate
[1:12:41.560 --> 1:12:45.560]  I understand again you know there was a desire to do some meetings tonight
[1:12:45.560 --> 1:12:49.560]  he was interested in doing and others are interested in doing and to do them
[1:12:49.560 --> 1:12:53.560]  in a way that was private meetings
[1:12:53.560 --> 1:12:57.560]  a planned better part of the day or was this something that was going on
[1:12:57.560 --> 1:13:01.560]  what time did they get that?
[1:13:01.560 --> 1:13:05.560]  I don't know the exact time I was
[1:13:05.560 --> 1:13:09.560]  I don't remember when I got notified exactly of when everything was going on
[1:13:09.560 --> 1:13:13.560]  before the press left
[1:13:13.560 --> 1:13:17.560]  I can go look up at Blackburn I don't honestly remember and I want to make sure that I give
[1:13:17.560 --> 1:13:21.560]  the information
[1:13:21.560 --> 1:13:25.560]  who notifies you about a meeting like that?
[1:13:25.560 --> 1:13:29.560]  Robert why were we not told about this meeting and that the senator wouldn't be on our
[1:13:29.560 --> 1:13:33.560]  flight until the doors were shut and we were about to taxi to take off
[1:13:33.560 --> 1:13:37.560]  again
[1:13:37.560 --> 1:13:41.560]  we had a desire Senator Obama had a desire to do
[1:13:41.560 --> 1:13:45.560]  some meetings others had a desire to meet with him tonight
[1:13:45.560 --> 1:13:49.560]  in a private way and that's what we're doing
[1:13:49.560 --> 1:13:53.560]  and at least we would have been in the same city with him but he could have done it privately
[1:13:53.560 --> 1:13:57.560]  we just wouldn't have been in the air during the duration of the meeting
[1:13:57.560 --> 1:14:01.560]  what's the rationale behind that leaving
[1:14:01.560 --> 1:14:05.560]  so we can get back to Chicago
[1:14:05.560 --> 1:14:09.560]  I mean it's not
[1:14:09.560 --> 1:14:13.560]  my apartment is going to be the same
[1:14:13.560 --> 1:14:17.560]  what the candidate is
[1:14:17.560 --> 1:14:21.560]  who made the decision that we were going to be in a separate plane
[1:14:21.560 --> 1:14:25.560]  who is the person I mean who do we complain to
[1:14:25.560 --> 1:14:29.560]  that guy looks like me
[1:14:29.560 --> 1:14:33.560]  if there's somebody I can email this off to I'll be more than happy
[1:14:33.560 --> 1:14:37.560]  I think the objection isn't just that he's not flying with us
[1:14:37.560 --> 1:14:41.560]  but that we left with Notre Dame at all
[1:14:41.560 --> 1:14:45.560]  look I understand your objections and I will
[1:14:45.560 --> 1:14:49.560]  make sure that everyone
[1:14:49.560 --> 1:14:53.560]  is aware of that and endeavor to
[1:14:53.560 --> 1:14:57.560]  set up a process as you said
[1:14:57.560 --> 1:15:01.560]  pause it there we'll play the rest later but the point here is this is how Barack Obama
[1:15:01.560 --> 1:15:05.560]  is going to govern this gives you an idea they tell the press get on the plane he's going to Chicago
[1:15:05.560 --> 1:15:09.560]  with you they get him on board the motorcade pulls up to fool everybody
[1:15:09.560 --> 1:15:13.560]  they lock the door start taxiing take off
[1:15:13.560 --> 1:15:17.560]  and then they're in the air telling him he's not going to Chicago and he didn't go to Chicago for a day and a half
[1:15:17.560 --> 1:15:21.560]  there's a desire for him to meet with some people at some meetings
[1:15:21.560 --> 1:15:25.560]  and multiple meetings secret meetings
[1:15:25.560 --> 1:15:29.560]  so this is even the controlled corporate media
[1:15:29.560 --> 1:15:33.560]  is manipulated and completely
[1:15:33.560 --> 1:15:37.560]  kept completely domesticated
[1:15:37.560 --> 1:15:41.560]  they get on the plane Barack Obama is flying with you to Chicago
[1:15:41.560 --> 1:15:45.560]  and they said because he had a desire
[1:15:45.560 --> 1:15:49.560]  the campaign had a desire to be able to have private meetings so we lied to the media
[1:15:49.560 --> 1:15:53.560]  and had you get on the plane and sent you to another state we kidnapped you
[1:15:53.560 --> 1:15:57.560]  and these people have been so trained how to be slaves
[1:15:57.560 --> 1:16:01.560]  that they don't even realize the full magnitude of what's just happened
[1:16:01.560 --> 1:16:05.560]  but this guy in plain view giggling and smirking and laughing
[1:16:05.560 --> 1:16:09.560]  they're going to be able to have secret meetings and so we lied to you and put you on the plane and sent you to a state
[1:16:09.560 --> 1:16:13.560]  600 miles away
[1:16:13.560 --> 1:16:17.560]  or is it 700 miles away
[1:16:17.560 --> 1:16:21.560]  this is how they operate
[1:16:21.560 --> 1:16:25.560]  this is what they do and the poor kept media that only knows how to read government press releases
[1:16:25.560 --> 1:16:29.560]  on the air they couldn't even figure out to go where they were all meeting
[1:16:29.560 --> 1:16:33.560]  but we were there with paramilitary forces
[1:16:33.560 --> 1:16:37.560]  and we found masks following us around and threatening us
[1:16:37.560 --> 1:16:41.560]  and pulling fire alarms on us and chasing us and
[1:16:41.560 --> 1:16:45.560]  photographing us and threatening us and grabbing
[1:16:45.560 --> 1:16:49.560]  demonstrators out of the line and slamming them up against police cars
[1:16:49.560 --> 1:16:53.560]  this is your criminal government they do whatever they want
[1:16:53.560 --> 1:16:57.560]  whenever they want they act however they want and now
[1:16:57.560 --> 1:17:01.560]  our entire life is basically at the whim of covert operations
[1:17:01.560 --> 1:17:05.560]  almost the entire government is secret operating
[1:17:05.560 --> 1:17:09.560]  with no checks and balances in whatever way they want since 1947
[1:17:09.560 --> 1:17:13.560]  tens of trillions of dollars have gone into their pockets they're turning the entire country
[1:17:13.560 --> 1:17:17.560]  into an armed camp the Bilderberg group says they're going to put microchips in everybody
[1:17:17.560 --> 1:17:21.560]  they've jacked the oil prices up like we told you they want to start more wars
[1:17:21.560 --> 1:17:25.560]  they've got brainwashed military goons who they corrupt by taking to
[1:17:25.560 --> 1:17:29.560]  Iraq and then paying them hundreds of thousands of dollars off the table to turn them into criminals
[1:17:29.560 --> 1:17:33.560]  then they bring them back domestically and now the government the military
[1:17:33.560 --> 1:17:37.560]  the police the campaigns are so corrupt they kidnap
[1:17:37.560 --> 1:17:41.560]  entire jets full of the entire press corps
[1:17:41.560 --> 1:17:45.560]  a huge press corps the entire press corps covering Barack Obama
[1:17:45.560 --> 1:17:49.560]  because he had a desire to not have the press around
[1:17:49.560 --> 1:17:53.560]  this is a crime you little morons and you don't even know that
[1:17:53.560 --> 1:17:57.560]  you don't even understand that this is how our world
[1:17:57.560 --> 1:18:01.560]  operates where you're lied to you're manipulated you're controlled
[1:18:01.560 --> 1:18:05.560]  in this piece of trash sits there in giggles and snickers and
[1:18:05.560 --> 1:18:09.560]  laughs about it
[1:18:09.560 --> 1:18:13.560]  we have to circumvent the mainstream media you've got to tell
[1:18:13.560 --> 1:18:17.560]  everybody about info wars dot com and prison planet dot com you've got to get
[1:18:17.560 --> 1:18:21.560]  all the articles and videos we put up about the Bilderberg grid and what happened this year
[1:18:21.560 --> 1:18:25.560]  and continue for weeks and months to get them out to everybody so they understand what
[1:18:25.560 --> 1:18:29.560]  really happened here you've got to get our articles about a Barack Obama kidnapping
[1:18:29.560 --> 1:18:33.560]  the press corps and that should be the headline we need to rename our stories
[1:18:33.560 --> 1:18:37.560]  that's what it is so you can attend a secret meeting
[1:18:37.560 --> 1:18:41.560]  we need to get this out to the world and warn them we're waking up a lot of people
[1:18:41.560 --> 1:18:45.560]  we're going exponentially but it's not fast enough we've had great success
[1:18:45.560 --> 1:18:49.560]  but we have to become more resilient we have to become stronger
[1:18:49.560 --> 1:18:53.560]  we have to become bigger we have to stop being rinky dink all of us
[1:18:53.560 --> 1:18:57.560]  have to get more aggressive
[1:18:57.560 --> 1:19:01.560]  all of us have to get the word out now in a very
[1:19:01.560 --> 1:19:05.560]  sustained aggressive way because the
[1:19:05.560 --> 1:19:09.560]  shadow government has conducted a coup d'etat fully
[1:19:09.560 --> 1:19:13.560]  by the year 2001
[1:19:13.560 --> 1:19:17.560]  they took over to a certain extent over the issuance of currency and credit
[1:19:17.560 --> 1:19:21.560]  in 1913 they declared federal emergency rare organization and martial law
[1:19:21.560 --> 1:19:25.560]  under the wars power act of 1933 the government went underground
[1:19:25.560 --> 1:19:29.560]  in 1947 for private interest
[1:19:29.560 --> 1:19:33.560]  and then they used a successive group of wars and staged terror events to train us how to be
[1:19:33.560 --> 1:19:37.560]  prisoners and slaves and now we're going into the final deep
[1:19:37.560 --> 1:19:41.560]  phases we get back I'll finish up with what happened
[1:19:41.560 --> 1:19:45.560]  in those five days and I'll tell you about the harassment of my family and a lot more
[1:19:45.560 --> 1:19:49.560]  I'm Alex Jones
[1:19:49.560 --> 1:19:53.560]  our beloved republic is on her knees
[1:19:53.560 --> 1:19:57.560]  the forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty world wide
[1:19:57.560 --> 1:20:01.560]  but in liberty's darkest hour there is hope
[1:20:01.560 --> 1:20:05.560]  the first time in modern history the people are beginning to wake up it is essential that patriots
[1:20:05.560 --> 1:20:09.560]  world wide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the new world order master plan
[1:20:09.560 --> 1:20:13.560]  we have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat
[1:20:13.560 --> 1:20:17.560]  in the info war prisonplanet.tv is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom

[1:24:49.560 --> 1:24:53.560]  discussed from a source who does not make things up who has multiple

[1:24:57.560 --> 1:25:01.560]  nightmare who could believe that on tape they'd say yeah we lied to
[1:25:01.560 --> 1:25:05.560]  you and told you to get on the plane that we told you he was going to chicago
[1:25:05.560 --> 1:25:09.560]  but he wasn't because he wanted some privacy and he wanted to be able to have some secret
[1:25:09.560 --> 1:25:13.560]  meaning so we lied and said he was on a plane and then knowingly
[1:25:13.560 --> 1:25:17.560]  premeditatedly lied and took off that that that's kidnapping
[1:25:17.560 --> 1:25:21.560]  that's like telling a child your mommy's in the car come get with us and you jump in the car and they drive
[1:25:21.560 --> 1:25:25.560]  off with you it's deception it's fraud it's racketeering

[1:25:33.560 --> 1:25:37.560]  of what happened in a chronological order I'm going to go ahead and just
[1:25:37.560 --> 1:25:41.560]  talk about this now I'm going to start the story this way
[1:25:45.560 --> 1:25:49.560]  there was this obvious
[1:25:49.560 --> 1:25:53.560]  fed in there asking us what our itinerary was every now and we go to the bar
[1:25:53.560 --> 1:25:57.560]  asking us if we wanted to be taken to the state department to infiltrate or quote
[1:25:57.560 --> 1:26:01.560]  take them on or you know do something to them or
[1:26:01.560 --> 1:26:05.560]  I mean it was just so obvious and these guys all
[1:26:05.560 --> 1:26:09.560]  are just big federal cops I mean they all look exactly the same
[1:26:09.560 --> 1:26:13.560]  they all think they're smart they have this fake vision of patriotism
[1:26:13.560 --> 1:26:17.560]  they're following and then all they do is just engage in every crime you can imagine
[1:26:17.560 --> 1:26:21.560]  they're horrid people very weak minded
[1:26:21.560 --> 1:26:25.560]  and I walk up and he's got this
[1:26:25.560 --> 1:26:29.560]  I want to introduce you to an army colonel he's going back to Iraq next week
[1:26:29.560 --> 1:26:33.560]  and he's over there fighting for America I was like oh god
[1:26:33.560 --> 1:26:37.560]  and then you know here's this army colonel with the shaved head
[1:26:37.560 --> 1:26:41.560]  and he had the haircut of the colonels and the generals always get were shaving the
[1:26:41.560 --> 1:26:45.560]  side a little bit on the top come forward I'm sitting there talking to him and I say
[1:26:45.560 --> 1:26:49.560]  oh yeah you're over there where they fly in billions of dollars every month
[1:26:49.560 --> 1:26:53.560]  big pallets and hundred dollar bills and give them out to the troops and the warlords
[1:26:53.560 --> 1:26:57.560]  he was actually I'm involved in distributing that out and these two guys are smiling and laughing about it
[1:26:57.560 --> 1:27:01.560]  and I said yeah he goes how do you know about that and I said well I've talked to family
[1:27:01.560 --> 1:27:05.560]  you know a private gets 30,000 a sergeant gets 60, 80, 100
[1:27:05.560 --> 1:27:09.560]  thousand a colonel gets millions the generals get tens of millions and I said
[1:27:09.560 --> 1:27:13.560]  this is a way to corrupt them this is a way to illegally give them illegal money
[1:27:13.560 --> 1:27:17.560]  and I said you know all these army investigators and people have been murdered
[1:27:17.560 --> 1:27:21.560]  it's in the hundreds now of investigators that have been murdered
[1:27:21.560 --> 1:27:25.560]  and they were laughing about that and it's just real funny man
[1:27:25.560 --> 1:27:29.560]  it's funny it's funny it's funny to get to be part of a mafia
[1:27:29.560 --> 1:27:33.560]  and run a country and wrap yourself in a flag and do whatever you want
[1:27:33.560 --> 1:27:37.560]  and have it admitted that they've flown in more than 60
[1:27:37.560 --> 1:27:41.560]  billion some estimates are over 100 billion dollars in every day
[1:27:41.560 --> 1:27:45.560]  C-130's landing with giant pallets tons of hundred
[1:27:45.560 --> 1:27:49.560]  dollar bills and they tell the troops here you're getting 30
[1:27:49.560 --> 1:27:53.560]  grand you're getting 35 grand but you don't tell anybody about this
[1:27:53.560 --> 1:27:57.560]  see that's part of seduction that's part of bending you and taking over
[1:27:57.560 --> 1:28:01.560]  the dark side corrupting you you're now mercenaries they now can
[1:28:01.560 --> 1:28:05.560]  use that against you they don't search you when you're coming back in with the money
[1:28:05.560 --> 1:28:09.560]  they're now making you the dirty dozen they're now creating cadres of corrupt
[1:28:09.560 --> 1:28:13.560]  people that are going to come back and rule us as police and FBI and military
[1:28:13.560 --> 1:28:17.560]  and I wasn't even really
[1:28:17.560 --> 1:28:21.560]  angry in hindsight at these young 25 to 35 year old
[1:28:21.560 --> 1:28:25.560]  goons driving around harassing us taking photos of us flipping us off
[1:28:25.560 --> 1:28:29.560]  I feel sorry for them they'll never have a chance to be real Americans
[1:28:29.560 --> 1:28:33.560]  they'll never have a chance to have true honor and duty and courage they just belong to
[1:28:33.560 --> 1:28:37.560]  a criminal mafia no doubt they're going to have horrible lives
[1:28:37.560 --> 1:28:41.560]  when you follow an evil path it ends up destroying you and they just have no idea
[1:28:41.560 --> 1:28:45.560]  what it is to be a true patriot then understand that the people running
[1:28:45.560 --> 1:28:49.560]  them and the people corrupting them scientifically are the ones destroying
[1:28:49.560 --> 1:28:53.560]  our sovereignty dismantling our bill of rights and constitution debasing our currency
[1:28:53.560 --> 1:28:57.560]  destroying our name worldwide

[1:29:17.560 --> 1:29:21.560]  so twisted you have been so given over to evil that you laugh
[1:29:21.560 --> 1:29:25.560]  you laugh about it I would talk to them on the bullhorn from just
[1:29:25.560 --> 1:29:29.560]  50 yards away and they laugh at me and smile and say that's right that's right

[1:33:23.560 --> 1:33:27.560]  and I am never going to surrender until I draw
[1:33:27.560 --> 1:33:31.560]  my last breath in eternal resistance to your evil
[1:33:31.560 --> 1:33:35.560]  and there's no doubt look at all your works look at your fruits
[1:33:35.560 --> 1:33:39.560]  look at what you have done look at who you are
[1:33:39.560 --> 1:33:43.560]  your masters have staged a string of hundreds of terror attacks
[1:33:43.560 --> 1:33:47.560]  the majority of which have been completely declassified we just had the 41st
[1:33:47.560 --> 1:33:51.560]  anniversary of our own government with Israel
[1:33:51.560 --> 1:33:55.560]  now declassified attacking the USS Liberty premeditatedly
[1:33:55.560 --> 1:33:59.560]  even the Chicago tribunes reported knowingly
[1:33:59.560 --> 1:34:03.560]  trying to send her to the bottom to blame it on Egypt and start World War 3
[1:34:03.560 --> 1:34:07.560]  by the grace of God those true sailors those true patriots
[1:34:07.560 --> 1:34:11.560]  the spirit of 1776 kept that ship the most highly decorated
[1:34:11.560 --> 1:34:15.560]  in U.S. history that's more than the Lexington folks more than John Paul Jones
[1:34:15.560 --> 1:34:19.560]  his little navy more highly decorated than them they kept that ship afloat
[1:34:19.560 --> 1:34:23.560]  for hour after hour after hour while they were attacked by fighter bombers and
[1:34:23.560 --> 1:34:27.560]  Daeson miseries Mirage torpedo boats
[1:34:27.560 --> 1:34:31.560]  as you killed them as you blew 30 foot holes with torpedoes in them
[1:34:31.560 --> 1:34:35.560]  as they went into fiery rooms to close the bulkheads to keep it alive as those men
[1:34:35.560 --> 1:34:39.560]  that went down there to shut those bulkheads burned to death
[1:34:39.560 --> 1:34:43.560]  literally on fire turning the wheels on the wall on the doors
[1:34:43.560 --> 1:34:47.560]  to lock them down and dying men trapped below men with broken
[1:34:47.560 --> 1:34:51.560]  legs crawling down through wreckage into the water to get their friends
[1:34:51.560 --> 1:34:55.560]  out those are true patriots those are true men
[1:34:55.560 --> 1:34:59.560]  of honor that you attacked you bastards in
[1:34:59.560 --> 1:35:03.560]  sent com you bastards at the Pentagon you murdering filth
[1:35:03.560 --> 1:35:07.560]  you totally sold your souls to the darkest wickedness
[1:35:07.560 --> 1:35:11.560]  it's unimaginable look at how
[1:35:11.560 --> 1:35:15.560]  in 17 years 17 years of siege
[1:35:15.560 --> 1:35:19.560]  more than 2 million dead Iraqis more than a million in the last five plus years
[1:35:19.560 --> 1:35:23.560]  Madeleine Albright admitting 700,000 children had died from the sanctions in
[1:35:23.560 --> 1:35:27.560]  97 and saying it was a good thing
[1:35:27.560 --> 1:35:31.560]  saying it was a good thing and she was there
[1:35:31.560 --> 1:35:35.560]  and then you write memos saying we can torture people to death
[1:35:35.560 --> 1:35:39.560]  we can crush 2 year olds bodies with pliers we can rape them in front of their families
[1:35:39.560 --> 1:35:43.560]  and you sit there and laugh about it it's funny
[1:35:43.560 --> 1:35:47.560]  you think that's power you think that's strength you think when we've got a government
[1:35:47.560 --> 1:35:51.560]  and an intelligent system that does things like that that any of you are safe
[1:35:51.560 --> 1:35:55.560]  you think when there's nothing holding you back from looting the treasury
[1:35:55.560 --> 1:35:59.560]  and the Pentagon treasury and when there's lawless corruption you think you're being
[1:35:59.560 --> 1:36:03.560]  off troops with big mountains of cash for no reason
[1:36:03.560 --> 1:36:07.560]  you're being inducted you're being included in the evil you're being made accessories
[1:36:07.560 --> 1:36:11.560]  to it you're being bound you're being bred you're being trained
[1:36:11.560 --> 1:36:15.560]  you're being twisted and forged in the fires of hell itself
[1:36:15.560 --> 1:36:19.560]  think about what
[1:36:19.560 --> 1:36:23.560]  you've become think about what you've turned into think about and even if you
[1:36:23.560 --> 1:36:27.560]  weren't engaged in any of these crimes you're listening you gave support to the war
[1:36:27.560 --> 1:36:31.560]  you are now accomplices to it and you can't deny it
[1:36:31.560 --> 1:36:35.560]  they admitted they did all of this they admit millions are dead
[1:36:35.560 --> 1:36:39.560]  they admit they're destroying the dollar by design they admit they're destroying the sovereignty
[1:36:39.560 --> 1:36:43.560]  on our borders by design there's no doubting it they made the choice
[1:36:43.560 --> 1:36:47.560]  public they publicly said torture was good they publicly said
[1:36:47.560 --> 1:36:51.560]  secret arrest was good the army admitted that 97
[1:36:51.560 --> 1:36:55.560]  plus percent of those picked up at checkpoints and taken to 30 plus camps in Iraq
[1:36:55.560 --> 1:36:59.560]  families that didn't have their papers in order and you took them into groups of monsters
[1:36:59.560 --> 1:37:03.560]  that had hellish pleasure
[1:37:03.560 --> 1:37:07.560]  at their expense killing people beating them to death raping them
[1:37:07.560 --> 1:37:11.560]  with large objects covered with acid that's in the army's own report
[1:37:11.560 --> 1:37:15.560]  raping people with
[1:37:15.560 --> 1:37:19.560]  acid torturing children this is right out of hell
[1:37:19.560 --> 1:37:23.560]  and then you say we're the enemies
[1:37:23.560 --> 1:37:27.560]  you say we're hurting America
[1:37:27.560 --> 1:37:31.560]  they are seducing you they are getting you to join their
[1:37:31.560 --> 1:37:35.560]  forces they are twisting you they are turning us into pure evil
[1:37:35.560 --> 1:37:39.560]  for greater jobs they have in the future this has been done by behavioral
[1:37:39.560 --> 1:37:43.560]  psychologist at the highest levels
[1:37:43.560 --> 1:37:47.560]  committing you to evil
[1:37:47.560 --> 1:37:51.560]  I'll use a popular culture analogy revenge of the sith
[1:37:51.560 --> 1:37:55.560]  episode 3
[1:37:55.560 --> 1:37:59.560]  when the emperor tells Darth Vader
[1:37:59.560 --> 1:38:03.560]  to go who just minutes before a banana can skywalker
[1:38:03.560 --> 1:38:07.560]  tells him to go to the jedi temple and kill
[1:38:07.560 --> 1:38:11.560]  all of the children and that that would increase his power
[1:38:11.560 --> 1:38:15.560]  that that would turn him completely to evil the emperor says we have to find that clip
[1:38:15.560 --> 1:38:19.560]  you know then you will have the power then you will truly be a sith
[1:38:19.560 --> 1:38:23.560]  and he goes in there and he kills children and then
[1:38:23.560 --> 1:38:27.560]  it's symbolic his eyes then turn yellow from blue
[1:38:27.560 --> 1:38:31.560]  he then becomes a demon he fully turns himself over
[1:38:31.560 --> 1:38:35.560]  to the dark side
[1:38:35.560 --> 1:38:39.560]  and that is exactly what your masters had you do
[1:38:39.560 --> 1:38:41.560]  what do you think the writers of these big archetypal top films
[1:38:41.560 --> 1:38:45.560]  George Lucas said his films are so popular because he takes real things
[1:38:45.560 --> 1:38:49.560]  and puts it into a science fiction space opera fantasy
[1:38:49.560 --> 1:38:53.560]  it's the new fairy tales
[1:38:53.560 --> 1:38:57.560]  but this isn't a fairy tale what you've done
[1:38:57.560 --> 1:39:01.560]  did Darth Vader torture the children no he just cut them in little pieces
[1:39:01.560 --> 1:39:05.560]  you go further
[1:39:05.560 --> 1:39:09.560]  than even the nightmare villain of a movie let's talk about reality
[1:39:09.560 --> 1:39:13.560]  the Nazis tortured and killed people and did medical experiments on children
[1:39:13.560 --> 1:39:17.560]  and they would send hundreds of doctors every few months
[1:39:17.560 --> 1:39:21.560]  to Joseph Mingola's giant sprawling medical facility
[1:39:21.560 --> 1:39:25.560]  that was built on the back of a concentration camp a labor camp
[1:39:25.560 --> 1:39:29.560]  and he would train doctors and have them torture children to death and quote experiments
[1:39:29.560 --> 1:39:33.560]  sewing them together burning them in ovens torturing them
[1:39:33.560 --> 1:39:37.560]  testing drugs on them putting them in ice water lighting them up
[1:39:37.560 --> 1:39:41.560]  and shooting them and they call it the cement of blood the Nazis admitted it was to then
[1:39:41.560 --> 1:39:45.560]  larger cadres out of the medical facility to go out and do it on a wider scale
[1:39:45.560 --> 1:39:49.560]  they began their death camps by 35 taking the old
[1:39:49.560 --> 1:39:53.560]  the infirm the mentally retarded people with genetic disorders
[1:39:53.560 --> 1:39:57.560]  cripples and doing medical experiments on them
[1:39:57.560 --> 1:40:01.560]  what does CPS do admitted in the New York news taking
[1:40:01.560 --> 1:40:05.560]  children and testing drugs and pesticides on them till they die that creates
[1:40:05.560 --> 1:40:09.560]  cadres what are the atomic soldiers what did that do having the doctors
[1:40:09.560 --> 1:40:13.560]  knowing it was going to kill the troops with the radiation putting them in radiation chambers
[1:40:13.560 --> 1:40:17.560]  having them stand out just a half mile a mile from the blast having them
[1:40:17.560 --> 1:40:21.560]  go out and breathe it having troops go into chambers and hitting them with nerve gas
[1:40:21.560 --> 1:40:25.560]  and killing them see the German
[1:40:25.560 --> 1:40:29.560]  doctors had already been through that programming they were brought to the U.S. they then
[1:40:29.560 --> 1:40:33.560]  headed up the programs we didn't have Americans at the time in 1946-47-48
[1:40:33.560 --> 1:40:37.560]  that would do that and then those German doctors they were the dark seed
[1:40:37.560 --> 1:40:41.560]  who they'd been trained in evil who then trained our doctors and the programs got larger
[1:40:41.560 --> 1:40:45.560]  and larger and larger of people that once they've nerve gassed
[1:40:45.560 --> 1:40:49.560]  they tell a young private go in here you're going to get three days off they hit him with
[1:40:49.560 --> 1:40:53.560]  Sharon he dies they dissect his body tell his family he died of the flu
[1:40:53.560 --> 1:40:57.560]  thousands of cases of that admitted in England in the U.S.
[1:40:57.560 --> 1:41:01.560]  now you've created a cadre of pure evil
[1:41:01.560 --> 1:41:05.560]  killing our own troops
[1:41:05.560 --> 1:41:09.560]  and so that evil replicates and spreads we the good men and women
[1:41:09.560 --> 1:41:13.560]  the people that love liberty and love beauty and love honor and love goodness
[1:41:13.560 --> 1:41:17.560]  and who hate evil we have to spread our message we have to train others
[1:41:17.560 --> 1:41:21.560]  we have to build our force to resist their dark force
[1:41:21.560 --> 1:41:25.560]  we have to commit ourselves and even of our families if that's what it takes
[1:41:25.560 --> 1:41:29.560]  we have to commit totally as sacrifices for the tree of liberty
[1:41:29.560 --> 1:41:33.560]  we have to throw ourselves against these dark hordes we have to throw
[1:41:33.560 --> 1:41:37.560]  caution to the wind and ask God to fill us with his spirit
[1:41:37.560 --> 1:41:41.560]  and to guide us against this ultimate tyranny I want all of you
[1:41:41.560 --> 1:41:45.560]  with me now to ask God's spirit of love and light and goodness
[1:41:45.560 --> 1:41:49.560]  and creation and honor and creativity to enter us
[1:41:49.560 --> 1:41:53.560]  and to lead God and direct us and all of us together commit eternally
[1:41:53.560 --> 1:41:57.560]  to the war against tyranny and the war against those that abuse the
[1:41:57.560 --> 1:42:01.560]  weak and abuse women and children and those that dumb down
[1:42:01.560 --> 1:42:05.560]  societies and bring darkness
[1:42:05.560 --> 1:42:09.560]  I pledge eternal resistance to evil I pledge
[1:42:09.560 --> 1:42:13.560]  my body my soul my heart everything I am I pledge my family
[1:42:13.560 --> 1:42:17.560]  I am fully committed I will never turn away
[1:42:17.560 --> 1:42:21.560]  from my goal no matter where it leads me
[1:42:21.560 --> 1:42:25.560]  and I only ask God I never ask God for anything except to
[1:42:25.560 --> 1:42:29.560]  lead God and direct me and that I be a vessel against this evil because
[1:42:29.560 --> 1:42:33.560]  no mistake this is a spiritual battle our enemies say that they believe it it is
[1:42:33.560 --> 1:42:37.560]  all I've ever asked God is to lead God and direct me
[1:42:37.560 --> 1:42:41.560]  but I do ask God to protect my family
[1:42:41.560 --> 1:42:45.560]  I'm committed I'm never going to stop but I ask God
[1:42:45.560 --> 1:42:49.560]  that if anyone is to be taken in this if anyone is to be killed grabbed
[1:42:49.560 --> 1:42:53.560]  tortured turned into a mess
[1:42:53.560 --> 1:42:57.560]  they can take me torture me for years have me come out and say whatever they wanted know that
[1:42:57.560 --> 1:43:01.560]  happened no I've been threatened with that but I just pray that God at least put a
[1:43:01.560 --> 1:43:05.560]  hedge of protection around my family they don't deserve it but I have said
[1:43:05.560 --> 1:43:09.560]  and I say here on air no matter what the course I'm not backing off threats
[1:43:09.560 --> 1:43:13.560]  to my family intimidation only makes me intensify what
[1:43:13.560 --> 1:43:17.560]  I am doing and when I went to Bilderberg two years ago I felt
[1:43:17.560 --> 1:43:21.560]  a great quickening in my heart and soul and mind and I
[1:43:21.560 --> 1:43:25.560]  crossed a line when I bullhorned them and stood up to them and I felt the spiritual
[1:43:25.560 --> 1:43:29.560]  threshold that I stepped across and I felt a much greater
[1:43:29.560 --> 1:43:33.560]  threshold yesterday as Bilderberg ended and as I came
[1:43:33.560 --> 1:43:37.560]  you know back home that I have crossed another threshold a greater
[1:43:37.560 --> 1:43:41.560]  threshold and have gone to an entirely new level of commitment
[1:43:41.560 --> 1:43:45.560]  in this fight and I felt remnants of evil and remnants
[1:43:45.560 --> 1:43:49.560]  of worldliness and remnants of wickedness that were in me fall
[1:43:49.560 --> 1:43:53.560]  away I have been sanctified I have been purified
[1:43:53.560 --> 1:43:57.560]  and that doesn't mean I'm pure but I'm one step closer to being pure
[1:43:57.560 --> 1:44:01.560]  and I am committed and I turn my life and my soul and my
[1:44:01.560 --> 1:44:05.560]  destiny completely completely into the hands of the creator
[1:44:05.560 --> 1:44:09.560]  of the universe into the hands of Yahweh
[1:44:09.560 --> 1:44:13.560]  I have been literally baptized
[1:44:13.560 --> 1:44:17.560]  I have gone in and through the fires of the new world order
[1:44:17.560 --> 1:44:21.560]  repeatedly throughout my life and every time I have recommitted no matter what
[1:44:21.560 --> 1:44:25.560]  the threats no matter what the intimidation I have been re-energized
[1:44:25.560 --> 1:44:29.560]  and I want all of you to experience this I want you to experience
[1:44:29.560 --> 1:44:33.560]  true living I want you to experience a true awakening
[1:44:33.560 --> 1:44:37.560]  I want you to experience what it is to truly be a warrior for liberty
[1:44:37.560 --> 1:44:41.560]  and the weak I want you to experience what it is to truly
[1:44:41.560 --> 1:44:45.560]  commit yourself to goodness
[1:44:45.560 --> 1:44:49.560]  Now
[1:44:49.560 --> 1:44:53.560]  I don't like to scare my wife and she's a strong person
[1:44:53.560 --> 1:44:57.560]  and I get the emails I get the calls
[1:44:57.560 --> 1:45:01.560]  about how we're going to rape and kill your wife she's gotten them before
[1:45:01.560 --> 1:45:05.560]  we've gotten them over the years
[1:45:05.560 --> 1:45:09.560]  but you never know where they're coming from but yesterday I knew where it came from
[1:45:09.560 --> 1:45:13.560]  I know they were listening to my phones I even saw them listening to people's phones in the hotel
[1:45:13.560 --> 1:45:17.560]  they were so obvious about it and their
[1:45:17.560 --> 1:45:21.560]  their wiretapping operation was so industrial so huge in its scale that room after room
[1:45:21.560 --> 1:45:25.560]  was filled with them with their equipment out with their shaved heads and their plain clothes
[1:45:25.560 --> 1:45:29.560]  in their engaging in treason and crimes against the American people for simply trying to cover
[1:45:29.560 --> 1:45:33.560]  their illegal, Logan violating meeting at Bilderberg
[1:45:33.560 --> 1:45:37.560]  it was about
[1:45:37.560 --> 1:45:41.560]  3.30 we pulled in to get something to eat because we hadn't eaten since early that morning
[1:45:41.560 --> 1:45:45.560]  on our way to the airport we were trying to go into Washington to get some more of the monuments on tape
[1:45:45.560 --> 1:45:49.560]  for a film
[1:45:49.560 --> 1:45:53.560]  and I call my wife and my wonderful children on the phone laughing and telling me they love me
[1:45:53.560 --> 1:45:57.560]  and they can't wait to see me a very sweet phone call
[1:45:57.560 --> 1:46:01.560]  and I had a sure feeling that the enemy was listening
[1:46:01.560 --> 1:46:05.560]  and I had a sure feeling that it was enraging them to hear this pure love and this
[1:46:05.560 --> 1:46:09.560]  decency and the sweetness that was coming across the phone
[1:46:09.560 --> 1:46:13.560]  when I hung up with my wife two minutes later she called back upset
[1:46:13.560 --> 1:46:17.560]  and said a woman just called she had a eastern what you'd call a Yankee accent
[1:46:17.560 --> 1:46:21.560]  and she said
[1:46:21.560 --> 1:46:25.560]  is Alex there and she said no the classic phone call that Jim Garrison
[1:46:25.560 --> 1:46:29.560]  got that Malcolm X got that Martin Luther King got and it's in all those films about
[1:46:29.560 --> 1:46:33.560]  the real things that happened and they said the woman said oh and then
[1:46:33.560 --> 1:46:37.560]  she paused she said can I help you she said well I need to talk to him and she said well this is his
[1:46:37.560 --> 1:46:41.560]  wife you can you can leave your number and I'll have him call you back
[1:46:41.560 --> 1:46:45.560]  she said well that can't be possible it can't be he's not married we're together
[1:46:45.560 --> 1:46:49.560]  I'm having his baby
[1:46:49.560 --> 1:46:53.560]  my wife said sure you are and they hung up the phone
[1:46:53.560 --> 1:46:57.560]  and she knew it wasn't true from the start but the point is that
[1:46:57.560 --> 1:47:01.560]  it was a threat to my family it was involving my family
[1:47:01.560 --> 1:47:05.560]  it's a vicious thing
[1:47:05.560 --> 1:47:09.560]  there are rules of war even if you are on the dark side and for the New World Order
[1:47:09.560 --> 1:47:13.560]  and want to destroy our liberty and our freedom there's a reason that even
[1:47:13.560 --> 1:47:17.560]  evil armies and evil causes throughout history have followed the rules of war
[1:47:17.560 --> 1:47:21.560]  and people have been punished for not following them and let me explain to you
[1:47:21.560 --> 1:47:25.560]  why
[1:47:25.560 --> 1:47:29.560]  when you target people's families when you target women and children
[1:47:29.560 --> 1:47:33.560]  the rules change
[1:47:33.560 --> 1:47:37.560]  your family and children get targeted do you understand that
[1:47:37.560 --> 1:47:41.560]  I've always said here that I have never targeted your families your children
[1:47:41.560 --> 1:47:45.560]  your grown wives your grown daughters I have never
[1:47:45.560 --> 1:47:49.560]  talked about them I have now I have told other people to leave them
[1:47:49.560 --> 1:47:53.560]  alone because I understand how the ancient rules work
[1:47:53.560 --> 1:47:57.560]  we are men they are women they are children
[1:47:57.560 --> 1:48:01.560]  they are supposed to be left out of this because once you escalate
[1:48:01.560 --> 1:48:05.560]  to that point the gloves start to come off and I'm never
[1:48:05.560 --> 1:48:09.560]  unless I'm cornered in defending myself going to do anything offensive against you
[1:48:09.560 --> 1:48:13.560]  because I realize that that puts you in a weak position and you have to show who you are
[1:48:13.560 --> 1:48:17.560]  I'm going on to the end whatever the cost may be
[1:48:17.560 --> 1:48:21.560]  but others aren't like that do you understand that
[1:48:21.560 --> 1:48:25.560]  when you open that door when you break those rules you
[1:48:25.560 --> 1:48:29.560]  change things and you bring your women
[1:48:29.560 --> 1:48:33.560]  and your children into it do you understand
[1:48:33.560 --> 1:48:37.560]  you fools why we have ancient rules of war do you understand
[1:48:37.560 --> 1:48:41.560]  why there's ancient conventions against torturing
[1:48:41.560 --> 1:48:45.560]  enemy troops because when you get tortured you lose the moral ground
[1:48:45.560 --> 1:48:49.560]  when you get captured you'll be tortured when you carry out
[1:48:49.560 --> 1:48:53.560]  torture you lose the moral ground and now there are no game rules
[1:48:53.560 --> 1:48:57.560]  do you understand you've broken ancient conventions
[1:48:57.560 --> 1:49:01.560]  do not call my house do not call my cell phone do not threaten
[1:49:01.560 --> 1:49:05.560]  my wife do not threaten the gang raper as you did
[1:49:05.560 --> 1:49:09.560]  this morning oh it's escalated do not do you
[1:49:09.560 --> 1:49:13.560]  think you're intimidating me do you think you are scaring me I'm
[1:49:13.560 --> 1:49:17.560]  not scared I have affirmed that I will now be
[1:49:17.560 --> 1:49:21.560]  a focused laser beam no more joking around no more screwing around
[1:49:21.560 --> 1:49:25.560]  no more being a nice guy I am going to literally
[1:49:25.560 --> 1:49:29.560]  set my soul on fire in the info war I am going
[1:49:29.560 --> 1:49:33.560]  to truly be the leader I am I am going to unlock minds with God's
[1:49:33.560 --> 1:49:37.560]  help and unlock souls and we are going to build an army
[1:49:37.560 --> 1:49:41.560]  that will bring you to justice
[1:49:41.560 --> 1:49:45.560]  but of course you'll call see
[1:49:45.560 --> 1:49:49.560]  if you're going to torture Iraqi children and women why not call up other Americans
[1:49:49.560 --> 1:49:53.560]  and threaten us why not do things like that why not
[1:49:53.560 --> 1:49:57.560]  go all the way why not have no rules why not just do whatever
[1:49:57.560 --> 1:50:01.560]  you want but you understand that when you dig that
[1:50:01.560 --> 1:50:05.560]  pit for me you've really dug a pit for yourself
[1:50:05.560 --> 1:50:09.560]  you are abominations I don't even hate you
[1:50:09.560 --> 1:50:13.560]  I see you for what you are sad
[1:50:13.560 --> 1:50:17.560]  spiritually stunted mutated pathetic weak people
[1:50:17.560 --> 1:50:21.560]  shame on you
[1:50:21.560 --> 1:50:25.560]  you know what made Andrew Jackson so powerful
[1:50:25.560 --> 1:50:29.560]  love him or hate him it was that he watched his mother and his brother die in a
[1:50:29.560 --> 1:50:33.560]  British concentration camp and it created a man
[1:50:33.560 --> 1:50:37.560]  who you could shoot holes in and stab over and over and he wouldn't stop
[1:50:37.560 --> 1:50:41.560]  and I'm nothing compared to that man but you've put me one step closer
[1:50:41.560 --> 1:50:45.560]  to that path by messing with my family and I eternally swear
[1:50:45.560 --> 1:50:49.560]  you will be brought to justice and all of you that have engaged in crimes
[1:50:49.560 --> 1:51:15.560]  will be brought to justice

[1:54:06.760 --> 1:54:12.440]  I want to make a point to you, I want to make it very clear to those of you who have thrown
[1:54:12.440 --> 1:54:19.640]  all the rules of society out the window, do you think for a minute your leaders, the people
[1:54:19.640 --> 1:54:23.440]  using you, care about you when they will do the type of things they're commanding you
[1:54:23.440 --> 1:54:27.480]  and ordering you to do that you engage in with such abandon and enjoyment?
[1:54:27.480 --> 1:54:32.360]  See, they take good troops and they find out who's mentally ill, who's psychopathic,
[1:54:32.360 --> 1:54:37.240]  who's sadistic, who are sadistic psychopaths and they put them in positions of power and
[1:54:37.240 --> 1:54:39.160]  they put underlings under them.
[1:54:39.160 --> 1:54:43.000]  But they've got such a shortage of these people, they need so many to suppress and dominate
[1:54:43.000 --> 1:54:47.320]  the world that they hire illegal alien felons, felons out of our prisons.
[1:54:47.320 --> 1:54:51.240]  I told you this nine years ago, it's now all over the mainstream news, but the mainstream
[1:54:51.240 --> 1:54:53.720]  news is saying it's a good thing.
[1:54:53.720 --> 1:54:56.140]  Hiring felons is not a good thing.
[1:54:56.140 --> 1:55:00.520]  Every evil thing that's been done in history, the establishment, the New World Order elite
[1:55:00.520 --> 1:55:06.720]  have made a list and they're following it, they're covering it, they're doing it.
[1:55:06.720 --> 1:55:10.840]  And a lot of you have not been fully turned over to evil yet, you've already rationalized
[1:55:10.840 --> 1:55:14.920]  a lot of bad things you've done and once you've committed all these crimes against humanity,
[1:55:14.920 --> 1:55:17.160]  you can't admit you were wrong.
[1:55:17.160 --> 1:55:18.880]  It takes strength to admit you were wrong.
[1:55:18.880 --> 1:55:22.480]  I've done plenty of things in my life that were bad, but I can admit I was wrong and
[1:55:22.480 --> 1:55:23.480]  I've repented.
[1:55:23.480 --> 1:55:29.120]  But the more you harden your heart, the more you turn to evil, the more it takes you over,
[1:55:29.120 --> 1:55:33.160]  the more it turns you into a zombie-like slave.
[1:55:33.160 --> 1:55:37.680]  And I'm telling you now, turn from your wicked ways.
[1:55:37.680 --> 1:55:44.480]  Seek the face of God, hit your knees and you will be filled with the power you could never
[1:55:44.480 --> 1:55:45.480]  imagine.
[1:55:45.480 --> 1:55:47.520]  You know, that's the devil's lie.
[1:55:47.520 --> 1:55:52.120]  You think you get power by being evil, you think that dark sunshine, that black force,
[1:55:52.120 --> 1:55:55.760]  that black illumination that you feel has strengthened his weakness.
[1:55:55.760 --> 1:55:57.320]  You have no idea the power of love.
[1:55:57.320 --> 1:55:59.720]  You have no idea the power that it gives.
[1:55:59.720 --> 1:56:04.240]  You have no idea what real courage is.
[1:56:04.240 --> 1:56:08.720]  And I wish you could drink from the same water that fills my soul.
[1:56:08.720 --> 1:56:10.520]  I wish you could be my brother.
[1:56:10.520 --> 1:56:14.840]  I wish you could help us fight this tyranny.
[1:56:14.840 --> 1:56:23.560]  I wish you had the discernment and the strength to realize what you've been turned into.
[1:56:23.560 --> 1:56:27.560]  You know, I think I've said my piece on this and I haven't finished up yet with what happened.
[1:56:27.560 --> 1:56:29.080]  I covered Tuesday, Wednesday.
[1:56:29.080 --> 1:56:30.080]  We got to Thursday.
[1:56:30.080 --> 1:56:33.120]  I want to cover Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday, the things that broke down and
[1:56:33.120 --> 1:56:34.120]  happened.
[1:56:34.120 --> 1:56:36.920]  But I want to hear from you, the listeners, about the Bilderberg coverage.
[1:56:36.920 --> 1:56:43.440]  You saw people that were there covering it, your take on what they're doing to our economy,
[1:56:43.440 --> 1:56:46.480]  what they're setting up in the world, on the things I've discussed.
[1:56:46.480 --> 1:56:50.400]  I want to hear from military men and women who have fought, who are great patriots.
[1:56:50.400 --> 1:56:54.320]  There were some Navy SEAL guys out there, really nice retired guys.
[1:56:54.320 --> 1:56:57.320]  They gave me a little gold coin with my name engraved on it.
[1:56:57.320 --> 1:56:58.320]  That was really nice.
[1:56:58.320 --> 1:57:01.920]  There were a lot of really good people out there and you could just see their souls.
[1:57:01.920 --> 1:57:07.680]  You could see the love in their eyes and the strength, mountains of men compared to these
[1:57:07.680 --> 1:57:11.800]  little stunted creatures that were posing and acting like they were men.
[1:57:11.800 --> 1:57:16.760]  On the other side, there were quite a few federal officers, though, that were nodding
[1:57:16.760 --> 1:57:21.120]  to us, agreeing with us, they'd look around and then, you know, smile at us and I have
[1:57:21.120 --> 1:57:25.040]  police saying, look, we know, you know, we're being ordered to be out here.
[1:57:25.040 --> 1:57:27.440]  They told us to kick you out of here, but we're not doing it.
[1:57:27.440 --> 1:57:30.080]  Quite a few police said, yeah, Alex, I've heard the show.
[1:57:30.080 --> 1:57:32.600]  I know about the New World Order.
[1:57:32.600 --> 1:57:34.720]  So they weren't all like this.
[1:57:34.720 --> 1:57:42.480]  I would say 30% of the feds would, you know, smile at me in earnest and it wasn't a fake
[1:57:42.480 --> 1:57:43.480]  or to get information.
[1:57:43.480 --> 1:57:46.760]  It was, you know, across through the trees that would look at me and nod or, you know,
[1:57:46.760 --> 1:57:52.720]  they would wink and you could see the genuineness in their faces compared to the guys that were
[1:57:52.720 --> 1:57:58.320]  posing as men, posing as tough guys, how they would look at us with hatred and how they
[1:57:58.320 --> 1:58:03.120]  would stand there like peacocks acting tough or how they would show us their little machine
[1:58:03.120 --> 1:58:06.760]  guns.
[1:58:06.760 --> 1:58:14.880]  So the entire government is not evil, but the leadership of it is completely 1-800-259-9231.
[1:58:14.880 --> 1:58:16.360]  I want to hear from veterans out there.
[1:58:16.360 --> 1:58:17.360]  What do you think of this evil?
[1:58:17.360 --> 1:58:18.960]  What do you think of what they've turned into?
[1:58:18.960 --> 1:58:21.880]  What do you think of them threatening people's families and playing dirty tricks?
[1:58:21.880 --> 1:58:27.040]  1-800-259-9231 and folks, get in game blueprint for global enslavement.
[1:58:27.040 --> 1:58:28.680]  It exposes the Bilderberg group.
[1:58:28.680 --> 1:58:29.680]  Everybody's got to see it.
[1:58:29.680 --> 1:58:45.960]  Now, from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in internet history comes

[1:59:43.840 --> 1:59:51.200]  Waging War on Corruption, Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[1:59:51.200 --> 1:59:57.440]  Media, government cover-ups.
[1:59:57.440 --> 1:59:58.440]  You want answers?
[1:59:58.440 --> 2:00:00.640]  Well, so does he.
[2:00:00.640 --> 2:00:09.600]  He's Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network, and now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[2:00:09.600 --> 2:00:11.760]  We're going to take calls for 30 minutes.
[2:00:11.760 --> 2:00:16.080]  Then I have Ellen Watt joining me for an hour in the last 30.
[2:00:16.080 --> 2:00:18.960]  I will complete what I started in the first 30 of the show.
[2:00:18.960 --> 2:00:22.480]  What happened Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday at Bilderberg?
[2:00:22.480 --> 2:00:25.360]  I've kind of told you the first two days, and then what happened at the end yesterday
[2:00:25.360 --> 2:00:28.680]  with the threats and more this morning.
[2:00:28.680 --> 2:00:33.680]  But right now, I mean, is that not terrorism, threatening people's families, making stuff
[2:00:33.680 --> 2:00:35.040]  up?
[2:00:35.040 --> 2:00:36.520]  They are the terrorists, ladies and gentlemen.
[2:00:36.520 --> 2:00:37.800]  They use the terror to control us.
[2:00:37.800 --> 2:00:40.080]  They attack us because they hate our freedoms.
[2:00:40.080 --> 2:00:43.400]  It's just not al-Qaeda that they created, as they say it, as our own government.
[2:00:43.400 --> 2:00:46.760]  The criminals that run it, that have hijacked it.
[2:00:46.760 --> 2:00:50.360]  Christopher Peggy, Diane, Mark, Dom, are going to your calls right now.
[2:00:50.360 --> 2:00:52.960]  Christopher in New Jersey, you're on the air worldwide.
[2:00:52.960 --> 2:00:53.960]  Hello?
[2:00:53.960 --> 2:00:54.960]  Yes, sir.
[2:00:54.960 --> 2:00:55.960]  Hi there.
[2:00:55.960 --> 2:00:56.960]  Hi.
[2:00:56.960 --> 2:00:58.560]  I'm from Chris and from New Jersey.
[2:00:58.560 --> 2:01:03.160]  It's an honor to speak with you right now, Mr. Jones, and I'll tell you, I had a heck
[2:01:03.160 --> 2:01:04.880]  of a time last week.
[2:01:04.880 --> 2:01:07.480]  So you were at Bilderberg?
[2:01:07.480 --> 2:01:09.480]  I was at Bilderberg.
[2:01:09.480 --> 2:01:15.840]  I heard your call that you needed people to get out there early, before Wednesday at least
[2:01:15.840 --> 2:01:22.320]  to get some footage of the hotel and anything to do, and so I had nothing better to do.
[2:01:22.320 --> 2:01:29.520]  So I went down to Virginia and I was staying somewhere far outside of Chantilly, but I
[2:01:29.520 --> 2:01:39.040]  got there Tuesday around 5, 6 o'clock, and I began to film inside of the hotel and outside.
[2:01:39.040 --> 2:01:40.520]  I had no problems inside.
[2:01:40.520 --> 2:01:42.920]  The hotel staff was very nice.
[2:01:42.920 --> 2:01:44.960]  They didn't mind me being there.
[2:01:44.960 --> 2:01:51.400]  And then outside, when I went to film, I was filming some of the front parts of the hotel,
[2:01:51.400 --> 2:01:56.920]  and that lasted for, I don't know, three, four minutes, and then I had this unmarked
[2:01:56.920 --> 2:02:03.360]  white van pull up right to the front of the lawn there where I was.
[2:02:03.360 --> 2:02:09.400]  And it was two guys in the car, dressed in very nice suits, and they came right up to
[2:02:09.400 --> 2:02:11.800]  me and they said, hey, you can't film here.
[2:02:11.800 --> 2:02:17.840]  And I said, oh, okay, assuming that they maybe had been hotel staff.
[2:02:17.840 --> 2:02:20.120]  And I said, well, who are you guys?
[2:02:20.120 --> 2:02:21.800]  Why can't I film here?
[2:02:21.800 --> 2:02:24.040]  And they repeated, you can't film here.
[2:02:24.040 --> 2:02:25.040]  You have to leave right now.
[2:02:25.040 --> 2:02:27.680]  If you don't leave right now, we will call the police.
[2:02:27.680 --> 2:02:30.720]  And I said, well, you know, I'm just filming here.
[2:02:30.720 --> 2:02:32.800]  Like there's no problem, right?
[2:02:32.800 --> 2:02:34.560]  And they said, no, you can't film here.
[2:02:34.560 --> 2:02:38.760]  If you don't leave right now and show me what you have on that tape, then we'll call the
[2:02:38.760 --> 2:02:39.760]  police.
[2:02:39.760 --> 2:02:43.800]  And I said, okay, sir, like I'm going to leave, like I'm done here.
[2:02:43.800 --> 2:02:46.240]  And then I pretty much was done anyway.
[2:02:46.240 --> 2:02:51.080]  And then he said, I want you to show me everything on that tape, and I want you to show me you've
[2:02:51.080 --> 2:02:52.920]  deleted everything on that tape before you leave.
[2:02:52.920 --> 2:02:55.920]  Yeah, this is some unannounced person not saying who they are.
[2:02:55.920 --> 2:02:56.920]  What happened?
[2:02:56.920 --> 2:03:01.800]  Yeah, unannounced person, no, yeah, did not tell me that they worked for the hotel, didn't
[2:03:01.800 --> 2:03:03.480]  even tell me who they were.
[2:03:03.480 --> 2:03:07.760]  So I'm walking back towards the parking lot to where my car was.
[2:03:07.760 --> 2:03:12.880]  And he said, you know, you have to show me that you deleted everything off that tape
[2:03:12.880 --> 2:03:14.520]  before you leave or I'm going to call the cops.
[2:03:14.520 --> 2:03:16.120]  And I said, no, I'm not doing that.
[2:03:16.120 --> 2:03:17.520]  I'm leaving right now.
[2:03:17.520 --> 2:03:18.520]  Don't bother me.
[2:03:18.520 --> 2:03:27.720]  So as I'm walking to my car, the guy in the passenger side of the car, he says, hey, this
[2:03:27.720 --> 2:03:28.720]  is my house.
[2:03:28.720 --> 2:03:30.640]  You can't film here.
[2:03:30.640 --> 2:03:31.640]  And I said, what?
[2:03:31.640 --> 2:03:32.640]  And he said, this is my house.
[2:03:32.640 --> 2:03:34.760]  You're not allowed to film here.
[2:03:34.760 --> 2:03:35.760]  And I was actually inside.
[2:03:35.760 --> 2:03:42.520]  I saw a picture of the two Marriott owners and definitely, you know, it wasn't them.
[2:03:42.520 --> 2:03:44.400]  So it wasn't this guy's house.
[2:03:44.400 --> 2:03:45.720]  So what happened next?
[2:03:45.720 --> 2:03:47.520]  I said, hey, sir, this isn't your house.
[2:03:47.520 --> 2:03:48.520]  This is a hotel.
[2:03:48.520 --> 2:03:50.080]  I'm allowed to film here.
[2:03:50.080 --> 2:03:51.760]  And so then he drove off.
[2:03:51.760 --> 2:03:57.920]  He drove over to my car parked right behind my car and him and the other man got out and
[2:03:57.920 --> 2:04:01.920]  they took down my license plate number and by the time I got to my car, they said, thank
[2:04:01.920 --> 2:04:02.920]  you very much.
[2:04:02.920 --> 2:04:04.560]  And they got in their car.
[2:04:04.560 --> 2:04:07.840]  And then they drove about 20 feet away and watched me.
[2:04:07.840 --> 2:04:12.480]  Now I knew that they knew that that was my car because when I had arrived and parked
[2:04:12.480 --> 2:04:18.640]  into the parking lot, they were about 50 feet away in the parking lot watching me as I parked
[2:04:18.640 --> 2:04:20.440]  and got out of my car and walked to the hotel.
[2:04:20.440 --> 2:04:21.440]  Stay there.
[2:04:21.440 --> 2:04:22.440]  I want to hear how this ended on the other side.
[2:04:22.440 --> 2:04:23.440]  We'll hurry.
[2:04:23.440 --> 2:04:24.440]  Everybody else's calls.
[2:04:24.440 --> 2:04:28.160]  1-800-25 at 99-231 Christopher, New Jersey.
[2:04:28.160 --> 2:04:31.920]  And the hundreds of you that showed up at the hotel gave us the cover to get in and out.
[2:04:31.920 --> 2:04:36.800]  There's no doubt that your diversions that you formed helped us complete our mission
[2:04:36.800 --> 2:04:38.760]  to get the truth out to the American people.
[2:04:38.760 --> 2:04:40.600]  It is our sacred honor and duty.
[2:04:40.600 --> 2:04:43.360]  These are enemies of the Republic that are destroying our sovereignty.
[2:04:43.360 --> 2:04:45.280]  The corporate whore press won't cover it.
[2:04:45.280 --> 2:04:46.280]  We will.
[2:04:46.280 --> 2:04:47.280]  Come hell or high water.
[2:04:47.280 --> 2:04:48.400]  Stay with us.
[2:04:48.400 --> 2:04:50.360]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[2:04:50.360 --> 2:04:53.640]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[2:04:53.640 --> 2:04:56.440]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[2:04:56.440 --> 2:04:59.480]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[2:04:59.480 --> 2:05:03.720]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New
[2:05:03.720 --> 2:05:05.240]  World Order master plan.
[2:05:05.240 --> 2:05:09.480]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[2:05:09.480 --> 2:05:14.640]  In the Info War, PrisonPlanet.tv is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.

[2:06:48.280 --> 2:06:52.360]  People who use Cardivite know about the pollutants in our body and want them out.
[2:06:52.360 --> 2:06:55.960]  For over five years, Cardivite has proven itself time tested.
[2:06:55.960 --> 2:06:59.320]  Here's Dr. Mattson, a naturopathic doctor's thoughts on Cardivite.
[2:06:59.320 --> 2:07:02.840]  In our mind, there isn't such a great big mystery to disease anymore.
[2:07:02.840 --> 2:07:07.400]  This basic tenet of yeast in the gut and metals in the liver covers at least 70-80% of the
[2:07:07.400 --> 2:07:08.400]  disease that we see.
[2:07:08.400 --> 2:07:12.360]  When we do our program in herbal formulas like Cardivite and you see someone who could
[2:07:12.360 --> 2:07:17.360]  barely walk up a hill now going for regular job a few months later, we know we're doing
[2:07:17.360 --> 2:07:18.360]  something right.
[2:07:18.360 --> 2:07:19.360]  It's a well-thought-out formula.
[2:07:19.360 --> 2:07:24.320]  I mean, the idea of it working on yeast and metals both at the same time and liver function
[2:07:24.320 --> 2:07:25.960]  is dead on.
[2:07:25.960 --> 2:07:29.640]  You'll find, I think, that it'll work more than just on heart problems and circulation
[2:07:29.640 --> 2:07:30.640]  problems.
[2:07:30.640 --> 2:07:31.640]  It'll work on other problems as well.
[2:07:31.640 --> 2:07:42.040]  For more information, call 1-877-928-8822 or visit our website at www.heartdrop.com.

[2:07:47.920 --> 2:07:53.840]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show because there's
[2:07:53.840 --> 2:07:55.840]  a war on for your mind.
[2:07:55.840 --> 2:08:05.040]  If you ever had any doubt how criminal the people are that have hijacked our government
[2:08:05.040 --> 2:08:10.440]  and our society and are engineering our society into a total dehumanization grid, the things
[2:08:10.440 --> 2:08:14.280]  I've seen the last five days just reaffirm all of it.
[2:08:14.280 --> 2:08:17.240]  Going back to Christopher in New Jersey, okay, they've got your car blocked in.
[2:08:17.240 --> 2:08:18.240]  What happens next?
[2:08:18.240 --> 2:08:21.000]  Okay, they took down my license plate number.
[2:08:21.000 --> 2:08:24.880]  Then they said thank you when I got in front of my car.
[2:08:24.880 --> 2:08:25.880]  They left.
[2:08:25.880 --> 2:08:27.720]  They waited for me to leave.
[2:08:27.720 --> 2:08:33.160]  They followed me out to the Marriott entrance, and then I drove away with my footage intact,
[2:08:33.160 --> 2:08:34.600]  and they stayed there.
[2:08:34.600 --> 2:08:39.240]  Now I was thinking, okay, everything's great, you know, a commission accomplished, and I
[2:08:39.240 --> 2:08:44.720]  was feeling pretty good about it, and it was really like an eye-opening thing to see these
[2:08:44.720 --> 2:08:45.720]  thugs.
[2:08:45.720 --> 2:08:46.720]  And what happened next?
[2:08:46.720 --> 2:08:52.320]  Okay, the next day, I was staying in my aunt's house about 40 minutes away from Chantilly,
[2:08:52.320 --> 2:09:00.720]  my aunt and my uncle's house, and the next day these three men showed up at her house,
[2:09:00.720 --> 2:09:04.040]  and now the car I had was my grandmother's car.
[2:09:04.040 --> 2:09:05.040]  It was not my car.
[2:09:05.040 --> 2:09:07.240]  I was driving it.
[2:09:07.240 --> 2:09:12.560]  Now they had, what they had done is they had called my grandma around 12 o'clock that
[2:09:12.560 --> 2:09:19.640]  next day, they lied to her and said that I had been in an accident, and that they needed
[2:09:19.640 --> 2:09:27.840]  to know if she had given me permission to use the car, what I was doing in Virginia,
[2:09:27.840 --> 2:09:28.840]  and all this.
[2:09:28.840 --> 2:09:30.080]  Now let me stop there.
[2:09:30.080 --> 2:09:32.240]  Coulda made her have a heart attack or a stroke.
[2:09:32.240 --> 2:09:34.320]  Everything they do is to hurt families.
[2:09:34.320 --> 2:09:35.840]  They revel hurting old women.
[2:09:35.840 --> 2:09:38.320]  I had to call my grandmother just in case she got a call.
[2:09:38.320 --> 2:09:39.880]  They revel in lies.
[2:09:39.880 --> 2:09:42.160]  They call people and say your son's died.
[2:09:42.160 --> 2:09:46.280]  That's another thing they like to do to people, and they wanted her to say no, he didn't have
[2:09:46.280 --> 2:09:47.280]  permissions.
[2:09:47.280 --> 2:09:48.480]  They can charge you with car theft.
[2:09:48.480 --> 2:09:53.080]  It's all about lies, setups, fraud, your whole government's criminal, ladies and gentlemen.
[2:09:53.080 --> 2:09:54.080]  So what else happened?
[2:09:54.080 --> 2:09:55.080]  Yes.
[2:09:55.080 --> 2:10:00.440]  My grandmother's very old, so she didn't think to question who are you and why do you
[2:10:00.440 --> 2:10:01.440]  need this information?
[2:10:01.440 --> 2:10:05.240]  But you traveled from another state to Virginia, you're barring her car, they find out where
[2:10:05.240 --> 2:10:06.240]  you're at.
[2:10:06.240 --> 2:10:07.240]  Yes.
[2:10:07.240 --> 2:10:11.600]  So they found out where I was staying and why I was there, well not why I was there,
[2:10:11.600 --> 2:10:15.120]  but they found out that I was down there and that it was okay for me to be down there.
[2:10:15.120 --> 2:10:16.120]  She gave me permission to go.
[2:10:16.120 --> 2:10:21.800]  Okay, so fine, so they go to, but if she would have said, you know, oh, he didn't have permission
[2:10:21.800 --> 2:10:22.800]  to have a wreck or something.
[2:10:22.800 --> 2:10:25.440]  They would have charged you with that or swat teamed you or maybe even killed you on the
[2:10:25.440 --> 2:10:27.400]  side of the road saying you were car thief.
[2:10:27.400 --> 2:10:28.400]  And I'm not kidding.
[2:10:28.400 --> 2:10:29.400]  They like to kill people.
[2:10:29.400 --> 2:10:30.400]  They've been doing it in Iraq.
[2:10:30.400 --> 2:10:31.400]  They got a hunger for it.
[2:10:31.400 --> 2:10:32.400]  They get off on it.
[2:10:32.400 --> 2:10:33.400]  We've caught cops on video.
[2:10:33.400 --> 2:10:34.400]  High fine after they kill somebody.
[2:10:34.400 --> 2:10:37.120]  Now, let's go back here.
[2:10:37.120 --> 2:10:39.200]  Now they show up at your aunt and uncles.
[2:10:39.200 --> 2:10:40.200]  Okay.
[2:10:40.200 --> 2:10:46.520]  So first they're, uh, my uncle's granddaughter, uh, just arrives when they get there and they
[2:10:46.520 --> 2:10:47.840]  run up right to her car.
[2:10:47.840 --> 2:10:50.760]  They knock on her window and they say, who are you?
[2:10:50.760 --> 2:10:51.760]  What are you doing here?
[2:10:51.760 --> 2:10:53.240]  She has a Massachusetts license plate.
[2:10:53.240 --> 2:10:54.960]  So they're saying, what are you doing here?
[2:10:54.960 --> 2:10:56.200]  Are you really from Massachusetts?
[2:10:56.200 --> 2:10:58.960]  Get out of the car when she had been on the cell phone.
[2:10:58.960 --> 2:11:02.720]  She, she didn't know who these guys were all dressed in plain clothes.
[2:11:02.720 --> 2:11:03.720]  No identification.
[2:11:03.720 --> 2:11:04.720]  Yeah.
[2:11:04.720 --> 2:11:07.800]  Secret police guarding foreigners that have hijacked our government.
[2:11:07.800 --> 2:11:09.320]  They guard the criminals.
[2:11:09.320 --> 2:11:10.320]  Get them from the press.
[2:11:10.320 --> 2:11:11.320]  Yes.
[2:11:11.320 --> 2:11:16.040]  And so they asked her for her identification, which is against the law to ask for anybody.
[2:11:16.040 --> 2:11:20.520]  It's not, there's no law that says you have to, plus they wouldn't say who they were.
[2:11:20.520 --> 2:11:21.680]  They would not say who they were.
[2:11:21.680 --> 2:11:25.880]  So then she was able to get inside and then once we closed the door and they were just
[2:11:25.880 --> 2:11:28.640]  knocking on the door, um, you know, trying to get in.
[2:11:28.640 --> 2:11:33.800]  So, um, my, my uncle had first gone to the door and, um, you know, I had a feeling that
[2:11:33.800 --> 2:11:35.880]  they might have been looking for me.
[2:11:35.880 --> 2:11:38.400]  Um, and I, and I said, you know, I'm not going out there.
[2:11:38.400 --> 2:11:39.760]  You know, I haven't done anything wrong.
[2:11:39.760 --> 2:11:42.480]  So they're, they're, uh, they showed a picture of me.
[2:11:42.480 --> 2:11:44.520]  They was like my passport photo.
[2:11:44.520 --> 2:11:48.040]  So they pretty much had all my information up on me and they're at the door talking to
[2:11:48.040 --> 2:11:49.040]  my uncle.
[2:11:49.040 --> 2:11:51.400]  Um, they, they just said, we want to talk to Chris and we want to talk to Chris and,
[2:11:51.400 --> 2:11:54.000]  uh, and they said, and, and, and I said, I'm not going out.
[2:11:54.000 --> 2:11:56.920]  And then they said, if he doesn't come out here or if he, if he's not in here, we're
[2:11:56.920 --> 2:12:00.720]  going to tow this car because it's from New Jersey and we don't know whose car it is.
[2:12:00.720 --> 2:12:03.520]  And, uh, you know, and they're still not saying who they are.
[2:12:03.520 --> 2:12:08.000]  Still didn't say who they are then, uh, my uncle had asked, well, well, who are you
[2:12:08.000 --> 2:12:12.120]  and, and they quickly flashed, uh, um, a badge.
[2:12:12.120 --> 2:12:18.080]  It, uh, I think it one was, uh, department of, uh, foreign diplomats or something.
[2:12:18.080 --> 2:12:19.080]  Actually, you know what?
[2:12:19.080 --> 2:12:20.080]  I found both.
[2:12:20.080 --> 2:12:24.280]  I've found two of the guys out of the three I found their photos on your, your, your website
[2:12:24.280 --> 2:12:25.280]  here.
[2:12:25.280 --> 2:12:29.200]  Well, I need you to write a blurb about what happened to you four or five paragraphs and
[2:12:29.200 --> 2:12:32.040]  tell us which photo it is and we'll post it as a story.
[2:12:32.040 --> 2:12:34.480]  Just send it to Aaron and info wars.com.
[2:12:34.480 --> 2:12:37.980]  And then the page, it has the correct photo of who it is, but this happened to two other
[2:12:37.980 --> 2:12:42.920]  people that I talked to, uh, who were out there where you wanted the two I talked to.
[2:12:42.920 --> 2:12:47.560]  Uh, I, I wasn't actually there, but my brother was and, and I talked to Adam who had happened
[2:12:47.560 --> 2:12:51.040]  to at his house who went and video taped and they came and threatened him and he saw him
[2:12:51.040 --> 2:12:52.920]  out there again and I talked to another fella.
[2:12:52.920 --> 2:12:53.920]  This happened too.
[2:12:53.920 --> 2:12:54.920]  So how did this end?
[2:12:54.920 --> 2:12:55.920]  What happened?
[2:12:55.920 --> 2:13:00.400]  Anyway, uh, I finally went out and talked to these guys and, um, they asked me why I
[2:13:00.400 --> 2:13:04.640]  was there and, and, um, and again, what badges did they flash?
[2:13:04.640 --> 2:13:11.120]  Uh, it was some kind of federal agency, the one guy tried to explain to me that he worked
[2:13:11.120 --> 2:13:15.520]  for some kind of, uh, terrorism agency and then the other guy was, said he worked for
[2:13:15.520 --> 2:13:17.760]  the Bureau of Diplomatic, uh, security.
[2:13:17.760 --> 2:13:18.760]  Yeah.
[2:13:18.760 --> 2:13:19.760]  That's the main group.
[2:13:19.760 --> 2:13:22.000]  They kept coming to me and saying, do you want to attack the state department with us?
[2:13:22.000 --> 2:13:24.120]  I mean, committing crimes, doing that.
[2:13:24.120 --> 2:13:29.840]  These guys seem to be very concerned that I was, uh, uh, a terrorist that, that, that
[2:13:29.840 --> 2:13:34.480]  I might have been scoping out, uh, this, this hotel till they just say that that's
[2:13:34.480 --> 2:13:36.440]  their excuse to intimidate you and threaten you.
[2:13:36.440 --> 2:13:37.440]  They're the terrorists.
[2:13:37.440 --> 2:13:38.440]  So what happened next?
[2:13:38.440 --> 2:13:45.280]  Uh, well, so they, they, uh, they finally found out that, okay, I was at the hotel yesterday
[2:13:45.280 --> 2:13:48.160]  and, uh, I'd, I'd been videotaping.
[2:13:48.160 --> 2:13:51.720]  I told them it was for a school project and all this and that.
[2:13:51.720 --> 2:13:56.680]  And, um, uh, so you better do a school project now because let me tell you, you never talk
[2:13:56.680 --> 2:13:57.680]  to these people, sir.
[2:13:57.680 --> 2:13:58.960]  They'll lie about you later.
[2:13:58.960 --> 2:14:00.200]  They'll do all sorts of things.
[2:14:00.200 --> 2:14:04.000]  They'll say you lied to federal agents, so you better put it out as a school project.
[2:14:04.000 --> 2:14:05.000]  So how did this end?
[2:14:05.000 --> 2:14:06.000]  Okay.
[2:14:06.000 --> 2:14:10.000]  So they wanted to see what I got on tape and I showed them everything I had on tape.
[2:14:10.000 --> 2:14:11.000]  There was nothing there.
[2:14:11.000 --> 2:14:13.000]  It was, you know, I did, obviously, I did.
[2:14:13.000 --> 2:14:14.000]  Okay, fine.
[2:14:14.000 --> 2:14:15.000]  I understand that.
[2:14:15.000 --> 2:14:16.000]  So what else happened?
[2:14:16.000 --> 2:14:20.040]  Well, then, uh, well, pretty much they just said, uh, they wanted to know, like my criminal
[2:14:20.040 --> 2:14:22.000]  record, they asked me about my tattoos.
[2:14:22.000 --> 2:14:27.000]  They asked me about the clothes I was wearing, trying to get a profile on me, I guess.
[2:14:27.000 --> 2:14:32.280]  Um, and then pretty much like I'd answered all their questions and, uh, was just being
[2:14:32.280 --> 2:14:36.880]  honest with them and, uh, they finally were like, okay, well, that's all we need to know
[2:14:36.880 --> 2:14:40.000]  and, um, and then they left, yeah.
[2:14:40.000 --> 2:14:41.640]  Well, amazing.
[2:14:41.640 --> 2:14:44.960]  Be sure and get all that video up on YouTube, Christopher, and I'm sorry that happened to
[2:14:44.960 --> 2:14:47.560]  you, but it sure shows you what we're dealing with.
[2:14:47.560 --> 2:14:51.600]  You try this free press to go cover world elite coming in to set our policy.
[2:14:51.600 --> 2:14:53.880]  You don't do that in land of the slaves, home of the cowards.
[2:14:53.880 --> 2:14:55.360]  I appreciate you, my friend.
[2:14:55.360 --> 2:14:56.360]  Take care.
[2:14:56.360 --> 2:14:57.360]  Thank you.
[2:14:57.360 --> 2:14:58.360]  You too.
[2:14:58.360 --> 2:14:59.360]  Write it up, get it out.
[2:14:59.360 --> 2:15:02.560]  By the way, in DC, we had independent film channel with us.
[2:15:02.560 --> 2:15:06.640]  We went two nights, uh, two days and nights, uh, after we'd be there in the morning at
[2:15:06.640 --> 2:15:11.160]  the Bilderberg group covering it, just to videotape the Washington monument and videotape, uh,
[2:15:11.160 --> 2:15:12.160]  other things.
[2:15:12.160 --> 2:15:13.160]  There was other cameras out there.
[2:15:13.160 --> 2:15:16.840]  We got big press cameras out there and police would just run up and say, you're not allowed
[2:15:16.840 --> 2:15:19.160]  to videotape and security guards will arrest you.
[2:15:19.160 --> 2:15:22.360]  And I'd say an independent film channel and tried to go get permits to film and they'd
[2:15:22.360 --> 2:15:23.640]  say, we're a non permit city.
[2:15:23.640 --> 2:15:24.640]  You have a right.
[2:15:24.640 --> 2:15:28.080]  Uh, you know, we're just out on the grass in front of the Washington monument and I'd
[2:15:28.080 --> 2:15:31.960]  have to literally probably 50 times to have them threaten to arrest us, have us tell us
[2:15:31.960 --> 2:15:32.960]  to stay there.
[2:15:32.960 --> 2:15:37.720]  I mean, this is a, you can't, this is worse than Moscow folks than the, you know, the
[2:15:37.720 --> 2:15:38.720]  Moscow square.
[2:15:38.720 --> 2:15:44.440]  I mean, this country is just unbelievably thug run and it's just going to get worse
[2:15:44.440 --> 2:15:49.760]  and worse and worse of millions of these parasites feeding on us, bossing us around, guarding
[2:15:49.760 --> 2:15:52.280]  the criminals that run the government.
[2:15:52.280 --> 2:15:54.800]  And, uh, I mean, it's just everywhere.
[2:15:54.800 --> 2:15:57.320]  It's just, it's so pathetic.
[2:15:57.320 --> 2:16:01.040]  And all of our Washington is death, deterrence, liberty, the first amendment on, you know,
[2:16:01.040 --> 2:16:05.680]  on the side of huge marble buildings and, but all they do with all these signs of liberty
[2:16:05.680 --> 2:16:10.880]  and all these names of liberty and all these names of freedom, that there is no freedom.
[2:16:10.880 --> 2:16:15.160]  We had cops for no reason, shove our cameras, get in our faces, security guards.
[2:16:15.160 --> 2:16:20.320]  I mean, it was insane and, uh, it would just go on and on and on and on.
[2:16:20.320 --> 2:16:21.320]  I had to say, go ahead and arrest us.
[2:16:21.320 --> 2:16:22.320]  We have a first moment.
[2:16:22.320 --> 2:16:23.320]  Right.
[2:16:23.320 --> 2:16:26.720]  Then they get mad and leave and they send another wave of them and we repeat the whole thing
[2:16:26.720 --> 2:16:30.880]  acting like they hadn't talked to each other on and on and on and on.
[2:16:30.880 --> 2:16:34.520]  And then I'm in front of the Supreme court and he said, no one is allowed to walk up
[2:16:34.520 --> 2:16:37.560]  with cameras onto the steps, but I go, but there's all these people taking pictures and
[2:16:37.560 --> 2:16:41.440]  they said, well, I can tell your mainstream media and you've got to call our office to
[2:16:41.440 --> 2:16:42.440]  get permission.
[2:16:42.440 --> 2:16:43.680]  I said, but I'm outside here.
[2:16:43.680 --> 2:16:44.960]  There's tourists everywhere.
[2:16:44.960 --> 2:16:46.720]  They don't give permits for that.
[2:16:46.720 --> 2:16:49.800]  And he said, okay, uh, you know what, that's just what they tell me to do.
[2:16:49.800 --> 2:16:51.960]  But I know I don't like the regulations either.
[2:16:51.960 --> 2:16:54.200]  You can have three minutes up there to take video.
[2:16:54.200 --> 2:16:59.800]  Even this other big, uh, uh, not security guard, but police, uh, Supreme court police
[2:16:59.800 --> 2:17:04.360]  comes out, gripes at him and it says, he's going to get in trouble in front of us.
[2:17:04.360 --> 2:17:06.040]  It's this culture of tyranny.
[2:17:06.040 --> 2:17:07.040]  There's no law.
[2:17:07.040 --> 2:17:08.200]  There's no nothing.
[2:17:08.200 --> 2:17:11.400]  It's just all bull.
[2:17:11.400 --> 2:17:13.480]  It's just all a bunch of thugs.
[2:17:13.480 --> 2:17:14.760]  And I watched the police.
[2:17:14.760 --> 2:17:18.940]  I'd sit there eating a sandwich, drinking a glass of water, you know, under a tree, shade
[2:17:18.940 --> 2:17:20.840]  tree and 100 degree record heat in DC.
[2:17:20.840 --> 2:17:26.160]  And I'd just watch security guards and cops boss and yell at and just randomly walk up
[2:17:26.160 --> 2:17:30.840]  to big crowds of people, tourists, families, and just harass us.
[2:17:30.840 --> 2:17:31.840]  It's about training us.
[2:17:31.840 --> 2:17:32.840]  We're slaves.
[2:17:32.840 --> 2:17:36.440]  And there's an article today about how DC's a police state and they harass everybody in
[2:17:36.440 --> 2:17:37.440]  mainstream news.
[2:17:37.440 --> 2:17:39.200]  I mean, it's far gone.
[2:17:39.200 --> 2:17:41.880]  I wanted to take a bunch of calls, but Christopher story took 15 minutes.
[2:17:41.880 --> 2:17:42.880]  It was so amazing.
[2:17:42.880 --> 2:17:43.880]  Give me a favorite call.
[2:17:43.880 --> 2:17:48.320]  Alan Watt telling me we've got him on at 40 after, uh, let's talk to Peggy in Pennsylvania.
[2:17:48.320 --> 2:17:49.320]  You're on the air.
[2:17:49.320 --> 2:17:50.320]  Peggy.
[2:17:50.320 --> 2:17:54.280]  I called about something else, but when this guy that just talked to you called, I said
[2:17:54.280 --> 2:17:56.800]  to myself, Alex is exactly right.
[2:17:56.800 --> 2:17:58.800]  You cannot talk to these people.
[2:17:58.800 --> 2:18:02.840]  These were probably low level thugs and they had been told what to do and they liked doing
[2:18:02.840 --> 2:18:03.840]  it.
[2:18:03.840 --> 2:18:08.680]  And by answering their questions, he simply made it, uh, he made that the whole incident
[2:18:08.680 --> 2:18:09.680]  last longer.
[2:18:09.680 --> 2:18:15.680]  They lied to see how he was apologetic when they called up with a vicious crime of harassment,
[2:18:15.680 --> 2:18:20.280]  intimidation, and terrorism, calling someone and saying your grandson was in a car race
[2:18:20.280 --> 2:18:21.280]  attack.
[2:18:21.280 --> 2:18:22.280]  Isn't that is terrorism?
[2:18:22.280 --> 2:18:23.280]  You get her.
[2:18:23.280 --> 2:18:24.280]  I mean, that's a terrorist threat.
[2:18:24.280 --> 2:18:25.760]  That's a very vicious prank.
[2:18:25.760 --> 2:18:27.000]  They just do this.
[2:18:27.000 --> 2:18:30.440]  You have to know your rights and you have to be polite, but stand up to them.
[2:18:30.440 --> 2:18:32.720]  And that is the only thing they respect.
[2:18:32.720 --> 2:18:34.400]  It's the only way to get to deal with them.
[2:18:34.400 --> 2:18:36.560]  You just say, Hey, Bubba, it's a public hotel.
[2:18:36.560 --> 2:18:37.560]  It's a free country.
[2:18:37.560 --> 2:18:38.560]  Obviously I'm free.
[2:18:38.560 --> 2:18:39.560]  I'm free press.
[2:18:39.560 --> 2:18:43.400]  If, if, if somebody had come to my head, if I was at a relative's house and somebody
[2:18:43.400 --> 2:18:48.280]  had come to talk to me, um, I would have made sure that my relatives knew beforehand
[2:18:48.280 --> 2:18:52.200]  that if anything like that did happen, they were to simply tell them the people that nobody
[2:18:52.200 --> 2:18:54.720]  was going to talk to them unless they had a warrant.
[2:18:54.720 --> 2:18:57.480]  And if they want, and if they didn't leave, we would call the police.
[2:18:57.480 --> 2:18:59.280]  What else did you call them up?
[2:18:59.280 --> 2:19:04.120]  What I called about was the, the greater cultural change that's happening, you know, the older
[2:19:04.120 --> 2:19:08.080]  generation doesn't fall for a lot of this stuff, but they're almost all gone.
[2:19:08.080 --> 2:19:13.280]  It's the younger people who are being persuaded just through all the media and everything
[2:19:13.280 --> 2:19:16.320]  they see and what they learn in school.
[2:19:16.320 --> 2:19:19.760]  To go along with this and that nothing really seems out of the ordinary.
[2:19:19.760 --> 2:19:23.680]  So many people are easy to lie to now for all the various reasons you've stated.
[2:19:23.680 --> 2:19:24.680]  Oh, I've seen it.
[2:19:24.680 --> 2:19:27.160]  The public are literally mindless.
[2:19:27.160 --> 2:19:30.720]  Anything else you want to add, Peggy?
[2:19:30.720 --> 2:19:34.720]  Just that the area of religion should be examined more closely, I think on your show, because
[2:19:34.720 --> 2:19:38.800]  it's so important what is being taught now versus what was being taught, let's say, 50
[2:19:38.800 --> 2:19:43.680]  years ago and what's being stressed and who's controlling the, for heaven's sakes, they've
[2:19:43.680 --> 2:19:48.960]  hired 26,000 preachers covertly to give sermons about giving in your guns.
[2:19:48.960 --> 2:19:53.080]  It's a big idea, a new world order.
[2:19:53.080 --> 2:19:57.920]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[2:19:57.920 --> 2:20:03.640]  It's known as the Bilderberg group, but their objective being world domination.
[2:20:03.640 --> 2:20:06.800]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[2:20:06.800 --> 2:20:12.720]  Now as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80%
[2:20:12.720 --> 2:20:17.160]  of humanity is at hand.
[2:20:17.160 --> 2:20:22.600]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[2:20:22.600 --> 2:20:26.440]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire new world order agenda.
[2:20:26.440 --> 2:20:29.120]  Bilderberg is making great progress toward a world government.
[2:20:29.120 --> 2:20:30.120]  Most people have no idea.
[2:20:30.120 --> 2:20:31.120]  They're not after money.
[2:20:31.120 --> 2:20:32.120]  They have all the money they need.
[2:20:32.120 --> 2:20:33.120]  They're after power.
[2:20:33.120 --> 2:20:34.120]  That's their aptitude.

[2:20:48.280 --> 2:20:53.200]  Ted Enners from Midas, June 9th, 2008, gold 898 ounce gold coins can be purchased for
[2:20:53.200 --> 2:20:58.120]  9, 24, 12, 455, 20 per half, 227, 60 per quarter.
[2:20:58.120 --> 2:21:02.040]  That's 9, 24, 12, 455, 20 and 227, 60.
[2:21:02.040 --> 2:21:06.760]  70% of China's 1 trillion reserves are in dollar, now purchasing 250,000 barrels of
[2:21:06.760 --> 2:21:12.480]  oil per day from Iran in euro, Japanese refiners by 550,000 barrels switching dollar to yen,
[2:21:12.480 --> 2:21:14.200]  bad news for US currency.
[2:21:14.200 --> 2:21:16.560]  China and Japan hold large positions in dollar.
[2:21:16.560 --> 2:21:18.280]  Trading equals permanent loss.
[2:21:18.280 --> 2:21:21.760]  Dollars fall into 65% of euro, erosion accelerates.
[2:21:21.760 --> 2:21:26.240]  Countries despise imperialistic policy of US, loss of confidence causing more selling.
[2:21:26.240 --> 2:21:29.040]  GAO is warning about the debt spiraling out of control.
[2:21:29.040 --> 2:21:30.040]  Why attack Iran?

[2:21:47.560 --> 2:21:50.200]  Hi, my name is William Lewis.
[2:21:50.200 --> 2:21:54.240]  And if you're listening to this radio station, then chances are, you've probably seen one
[2:21:54.240 --> 2:21:58.800]  or two of the documentaries that I've made over the years, 9-1-1 in plain sight, beyond
[2:21:58.800 --> 2:22:02.000]  treason, or maybe 9-1-1 ripple effect.
[2:22:02.000 --> 2:22:06.840]  And by now, you've got to be as angry as I am, and wondering, what else have they done,
[2:22:06.840 --> 2:22:08.960]  and what are we going to do about it?
[2:22:08.960 --> 2:22:14.160]  My latest documentary, Washington You're Fired, was made to explore these ideas of change,
[2:22:14.160 --> 2:22:18.400]  while at the same time, exposing the scope of the president's immoral and illegal spy
[2:22:18.400 --> 2:22:19.400]  program.
[2:22:19.400 --> 2:22:24.680]  We reveal the abuses committed under the Protection of the Patriot Act, Military Commissions Act,
[2:22:24.680 --> 2:22:26.920]  and other very intrusive spy bills.
[2:22:26.920 --> 2:22:32.960]  Washington You're Fired explores the removal of habeas corpus, posicumetatus, and the subversion
[2:22:32.960 --> 2:22:35.080]  of our entire bill of rights.

[2:22:45.120 --> 2:22:48.280]  Please visit TakeBackWashington.com.
[2:22:48.280 --> 2:22:50.640]  This is Steve Shank, J. Michael Stevens Group.
[2:22:50.640 --> 2:22:51.640]  Let's get real.
[2:22:51.640 --> 2:22:53.520]  Flower is already being rationed.
[2:22:53.520 --> 2:22:58.720]  Prices on food are getting so high, warehouses are installing security systems and guards.
[2:22:58.720 --> 2:23:02.680]  You can expect soon to see criminal activity in food.
[2:23:02.680 --> 2:23:06.800]  We're all in a foot race as to whether the food will become so expensive we can't afford
[2:23:06.800 --> 2:23:10.560]  it, or there will be no food at any price.
[2:23:10.560 --> 2:23:14.540]  We can't grow enough of our own food, even with genetically altered trash.
[2:23:14.540 --> 2:23:18.680]  It will give you the opportunity to eat perfectly engineered food.
[2:23:18.680 --> 2:23:22.880]  They think God didn't get it right, so Monsanto had to step in.
[2:23:22.880 --> 2:23:26.760]  If you think it's a little bit crazy to put in a supply of food, it's okay.
[2:23:26.760 --> 2:23:27.760]  We won't tell.
[2:23:27.760 --> 2:23:37.600]  Call 800-409-5633 on the web, eFoodsDirect.com, that's 800-409-5633.
[2:23:37.600 --> 2:23:40.480]  It may be a little bit crazy, that's okay.
[2:23:40.480 --> 2:24:04.480]  Because there is no such thing as a little bit dead.
[2:24:04.480 --> 2:24:19.080]  Hi, I'm Alice, this is Diane from New York, and I see it's a big day for news from Bill
[2:24:19.080 --> 2:24:20.080]  de Berger.
[2:24:20.080 --> 2:24:21.080]  A lot of my friends went.
[2:24:21.080 --> 2:24:22.080]  I wasn't able to go.
[2:24:22.080 --> 2:24:25.200]  I'm wondering if you'll allow me to talk about a legal defense benefit that we're going to
[2:24:25.200 --> 2:24:28.200]  have for Gary Tallis in New York.
[2:24:28.200 --> 2:24:32.840]  You're talking about the fellow from We Are Change who got shut up, and by the way they
[2:24:32.840 --> 2:24:41.960]  had their first court case, and the prosecution, he's the truther that supposedly beat up a
[2:24:41.960 --> 2:24:45.440]  lady in a wheelchair, but once they got to court, the prosecution wouldn't bring that
[2:24:45.440 --> 2:24:50.560]  up, and it looks like that if they force it to trial, it's going to get dropped.
[2:24:50.560 --> 2:24:53.480]  We've got to move quick though, Diane, we're almost out of time, we've got a guest coming
[2:24:53.480 --> 2:24:54.480]  up.
[2:24:54.480 --> 2:25:00.880]  Okay, let me just give you quickly, it's on Thursday, June 19th, at the Yipi Museum
[2:25:00.880 --> 2:25:06.120]  Cafe in Greenwich Village, New York, at 9 Bleecker Street.
[2:25:06.120 --> 2:25:12.920]  So that's Thursday, June 19th, 9 Bleecker Street, the Yipi Museum and Cafe, Greenwich
[2:25:12.920 --> 2:25:17.680]  Village, New York City, Songs of Freedom is putting it on for us.
[2:25:17.680 --> 2:25:23.400]  You can go to singfreedom.org if you want to learn more about the Yipi Museum and Cafe.
[2:25:23.400 --> 2:25:24.400]  It's a free admission, and it'll be effective.
[2:25:24.400 --> 2:25:28.080]  Yeah, Diane, if I knew about this, I'd be happy to have actually a guest on about it,
[2:25:28.080 --> 2:25:31.960]  so that I can then actually plug it and have an effect, because we've gotten thousands
[2:25:31.960 --> 2:25:36.440]  and thousands raised for him and the whole setup, and it's being proven now that it was
[2:25:36.440 --> 2:25:38.680]  a lie and a fraud and a media hoax.
[2:25:38.680 --> 2:25:42.040]  Anything you want to add about Bilderberg or the things that have happened?
[2:25:42.040 --> 2:25:47.440]  I think that this year there's 100 people, I want to see 100,000 people go to Bilderberg.
[2:25:47.440 --> 2:25:49.920]  Absolutely, Diane, I got to jump, thanks for the call.
[2:25:49.920 --> 2:25:53.440]  Mark and Georgia, you're on the air.
[2:25:53.440 --> 2:25:55.480]  Blessings to you brother, you're ever in our prayers.
[2:25:55.480 --> 2:25:56.480]  Thank you.
[2:25:56.480 --> 2:26:00.960]  Listen, one thing that particularly sparked this, I was watching on the History Channel,
[2:26:00.960 --> 2:26:06.000]  they had a thing about the hypothetical scenario, if this refinery were to catch fire and how
[2:26:06.000 --> 2:26:11.720]  it would destroy the economy, and basically complete economic collapse, and I'm like,
[2:26:11.720 --> 2:26:16.480]  gee, these guys have been known to be shills before they may be doing some prep work.
[2:26:16.480 --> 2:26:22.920]  Oh, no, they like to introduce the, like I saw a show on CNN about housing prices are
[2:26:22.920 --> 2:26:27.280]  dropping because neighborhoods are dirty and it's your neighbor's fault, call the city
[2:26:27.280 --> 2:26:31.760]  health department on them for tall grass, no, they've devalued the currency and the economy
[2:26:31.760 --> 2:26:32.760]  is plunging.
[2:26:32.760 --> 2:26:36.720]  It's just, I saw some frontline special Sunday morning in the hotel, like 10 minutes about
[2:26:36.720 --> 2:26:42.440]  how it was all accidental and George Tenet didn't know and Bush was wrong.
[2:26:42.440 --> 2:26:44.800]  People think that was anti-Bush, but it really wasn't.
[2:26:44.800 --> 2:26:46.200]  It was saying he made a mistake.
[2:26:46.200 --> 2:26:51.280]  Right, well, the mistake was that people trusted politicians, contrary to the many warnings
[2:26:51.280 --> 2:26:52.280]  of the founders.
[2:26:52.280 --> 2:26:56.400]  So, I'm tending my victory garden, my food stamps should be kicking in in a couple days.
[2:26:56.400 --> 2:27:00.720]  One thing I wanted to touch base with you about, because I assume this implicitly that
[2:27:00.720 --> 2:27:04.920]  it's on your website, that it's not a scam, this thing about processing forms is a way
[2:27:04.920 --> 2:27:08.200]  of bringing in income, that's for real I trust, right?
[2:27:08.200 --> 2:27:12.400]  Well, we have a lot of Google ads, we ban different ads all the time, we can't control
[2:27:12.400 --> 2:27:17.160]  what Google puts on, we have to see a Barack Obama ad or a John McCain ad and then ban
[2:27:17.160 --> 2:27:18.160]  it.
[2:27:18.160 --> 2:27:23.840]  Do you know the specific ad you're talking about, is it some deal where you sign up and
[2:27:23.840 --> 2:27:27.080]  then you do like temp work and get paid?
[2:27:27.080 --> 2:27:31.600]  Well, a friend of mine was suspicious and I didn't understand that there are certain
[2:27:31.600 --> 2:27:35.520]  ads that you don't have control over, the fact that it was on your website made me
[2:27:35.520 --> 2:27:36.520]  trust it.
[2:27:36.520 --> 2:27:39.120]  No, I hear you, let me let you go and try to answer that because I wanted to talk about
[2:27:39.120 --> 2:27:44.520]  Bilderberg and we're getting off into benefits and ads on the websites, here's the deal.
[2:27:44.520 --> 2:27:48.720]  I saw a comment on my website today saying, where's the TV network, where's the Alex's
[2:27:48.720 --> 2:27:54.480]  TV show, we've given the money bomb, we want to see it now, folks listen, I appreciate
[2:27:54.480 --> 2:27:58.080]  your call, we're going to let him go now, folks.
[2:27:58.080 --> 2:28:03.840]  What I'm trying to explain here is that I just signed a lease last Tuesday before I
[2:28:03.840 --> 2:28:09.160]  got on an airplane and left, now it'll take a month to put a wall in, knock it out another
[2:28:09.160 --> 2:28:14.360]  month or two to move in, months to wire it, months to even start a TV show and do it,
[2:28:14.360 --> 2:28:17.040]  except if I was a big outfit.
[2:28:17.040 --> 2:28:22.240]  I don't have the personnel, I don't have the people, we're all overworked here.
[2:28:22.240 --> 2:28:26.080]  Just a hiring process of trying to hire a few new people will be very hard, also trying
[2:28:26.080 --> 2:28:30.960]  to screen out shills and so I'm moving as quickly as I can.
[2:28:30.960 --> 2:28:37.600]  I need to get control of the type of ads that are on Info Wars and Prison Planet because
[2:28:37.600 --> 2:28:45.520]  we've got Google ads and it raises, I don't know, like $5,000, $6,000 a month and without
[2:28:45.520 --> 2:28:51.200]  it we'd be in trouble but then I've got to have my web guys keep more control over it,
[2:28:51.200 --> 2:28:55.320]  I've got to have some type of better vetting process, other people don't vet ads, I at
[2:28:55.320 --> 2:29:01.360]  least try and so it's it, you know, some of those ads, it's up to you to figure out what
[2:29:01.360 --> 2:29:05.960]  they are or obviously if there's some gay dating thing that pops up for a day before
[2:29:05.960 --> 2:29:10.400]  we ban it, you know, people, we got death threats from Arabs, you know, out of their
[2:29:10.400 --> 2:29:14.120]  minds because there was some Arab dating thing, you're not supposed to let Arab women go out
[2:29:14.120 --> 2:29:20.880]  and do that, you know, get a life, you know, that pops up there.
[2:29:20.880 --> 2:29:25.600]  I'm trying to get a hold of that, okay, I mean there's radio, other radio networks
[2:29:25.600 --> 2:29:30.280]  coming to advertise on Genesis, what are they doing letting that happen, you know, there's
[2:29:30.280 --> 2:29:34.960]  all sorts of other stuff, it's like I can't do a perfect job, I'm completely and totally
[2:29:34.960 --> 2:29:38.680]  overwhelmed, okay, we'll be right back.
[2:29:38.680 --> 2:29:48.800]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run, Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[2:29:48.800 --> 2:29:54.040]  Terror Storm, a history of government sponsored terror, loose change, final cut, in game blueprint
[2:29:54.040 --> 2:29:59.040]  for global enslavement, the true story of the Bilderberg group, the late great USA, America,
[2:29:59.040 --> 2:30:03.240]  freedom to fascism, these are just a few of the hundreds of powerful documentary films

[2:30:48.400 --> 2:30:51.200]  Listener, ask yourself, can I be deceived?
[2:30:51.200 --> 2:30:55.680]  Matthew 24 states four times, in the last days many will be deceived.
[2:30:55.680 --> 2:30:59.280]  There are many ideas about the mark of the beast and the antichrist.
[2:30:59.280 --> 2:31:01.000]  What do you know about the beast?
[2:31:01.000 --> 2:31:02.960]  It's mark and the antichrist.
[2:31:02.960 --> 2:31:06.920]  Is the beast a superpower nation or a giant computer in Belgium?
[2:31:06.920 --> 2:31:12.160]  Is it's mark an implanted chip, a tattoo, the national ID card or 666?
[2:31:12.160 --> 2:31:15.240]  Is the antichrist a person, title or both?
[2:31:15.240 --> 2:31:19.000]  Some believe these things are in the future, others believe that it's in the past.
[2:31:19.000 --> 2:31:22.400]  First John states the antichrist is already in the world.
[2:31:22.400 --> 2:31:24.480]  What is the truth and what is a lie?
[2:31:24.480 --> 2:31:27.080]  Are you willing to search God's word for the truth?

[2:33:42.360 --> 2:33:47.680]  I want to try to race through some of your calls for Ellen Watt pops in and joins us
[2:33:47.680 --> 2:33:52.440]  but in the last 20 minutes of the show we're going to get more into Bilderberg group.
[2:33:52.440 --> 2:33:56.040]  We don't screen your calls but people are all off on every other subject you can imagine
[2:33:56.040 --> 2:34:00.600]  which is fine but does anybody want to talk about my family being threatened?
[2:34:00.600 --> 2:34:07.640]  First getting a call, somebody lying and telling my wife that she was a woman and I'd gotten
[2:34:07.640 --> 2:34:12.960]  her pregnant, totally made up, ridiculous lie, clearly from the Bilderberg group right
[2:34:12.960 --> 2:34:14.680]  after I left.
[2:34:14.680 --> 2:34:18.440]  Other people, same thing happened to Likwardowski, his girlfriend, they called up his parents,
[2:34:18.440 --> 2:34:19.880]  threatened to kill him again.
[2:34:19.880 --> 2:34:23.680]  All this kind of stuff happening, then people sending us stuff saying we're going to gang
[2:34:23.680 --> 2:34:29.000]  rape your wife this morning and then we're talking about other issues here.
[2:34:29.000 --> 2:34:33.120]  This isn't even about me, this is about their mindset, this is about who they are, this
[2:34:33.120 --> 2:34:38.680]  is about how they operate, how they act, this is about how ruthless and criminal they are
[2:34:38.680 --> 2:34:42.600]  and they call this other young man's grandmother up as he's visiting in Virginia to go to Bilderberg
[2:34:42.600 --> 2:34:47.120]  and they get her plates and then they tell her he's been in a car wreck and that they
[2:34:47.120 --> 2:34:53.480]  need to know where he is, just lying, they always do it to hurt somebody, they enjoyed
[2:34:53.480 --> 2:35:01.360]  hurting that old woman, it's a psychopathic evil, just absolute scum because they work
[2:35:01.360 --> 2:35:04.880]  for a criminal elite that's engaged in every crime under the sun.
[2:35:04.880 --> 2:35:10.280]  Okay, Don in Texas and David, Al and Mike, go ahead Don.
[2:35:10.280 --> 2:35:15.720]  Oh hi there, hi there, I feel sympathetic with you where you've had these threats about
[2:35:15.720 --> 2:35:22.360]  your wife, I mean I think all the people that know you care about that.
[2:35:22.360 --> 2:35:27.840]  It isn't about me, it's about how they are criminal scumbags, that's why it's important
[2:35:27.840 --> 2:35:29.440]  that they do things like that.
[2:35:29.440 --> 2:35:34.120]  Why don't you try to get some interns you might call them that would stand around and
[2:35:34.120 --> 2:35:36.360]  be kind of guard duty.
[2:35:36.360 --> 2:35:40.280]  It isn't even that we need, we're not even worried about ourselves, the point is that
[2:35:40.280 --> 2:35:44.400]  their ruthless scum, it isn't about me, it's about what trash they are.
[2:35:44.400 --> 2:35:48.960]  The reason I call actually is about these guys, the Mormon people that they claim are
[2:35:48.960 --> 2:35:55.080]  polygamous, usually in a polygamous group like that there's only 10% or 5% that are
[2:35:55.080 --> 2:36:00.200]  polygamous and I'm afraid that they're going to try to blame them for a terrorist attack
[2:36:00.200 --> 2:36:01.960]  on the governor's man.
[2:36:01.960 --> 2:36:07.040]  You've heard about the governor's mansion being set on fire and you know they can fabricate
[2:36:07.040 --> 2:36:08.040]  that.
[2:36:08.040 --> 2:36:13.920]  Are they saying it was set on fire or are they saying it's an accident?
[2:36:13.920 --> 2:36:18.120]  Are they saying it was a arson, I don't think they're saying it's arson.
[2:36:18.120 --> 2:36:27.640]  They're trying to create a mob hysteria idea that it was, they're building that and you
[2:36:27.640 --> 2:36:32.960]  can't trust all these people, you can't trust DNA results from forensic.
[2:36:32.960 --> 2:36:35.640]  Because they'll set it up or lie, they've been caught.
[2:36:35.640 --> 2:36:42.520]  They're controlled but I'm sure that the people, I'm not a Mormon, I'm not even really, there's
[2:36:42.520 --> 2:36:48.640]  a guy called the Bible Answer Man Hennigraff that's been for the last six months pounding
[2:36:48.640 --> 2:36:54.920]  away on his radio program about the Mormons and all the atrocities and massacres they
[2:36:54.920 --> 2:37:01.920]  did a hundred years ago, of course they were in Missouri I think that a group of Mormons
[2:37:01.920 --> 2:37:08.040]  were attacked and that was back in the 1800s.
[2:37:08.040 --> 2:37:15.060]  But those people are really tragic, they've been kidnapped, the kids were kidnapped and
[2:37:15.060 --> 2:37:16.560]  held hostage.
[2:37:16.560 --> 2:37:19.920]  And now it's embarrassed the government because due process wasn't followed, it turns out
[2:37:19.920 --> 2:37:22.920]  the government did lie about everything and it's been a big embarrassment, thanks for
[2:37:22.920 --> 2:37:26.040]  the call and you're right sir.
[2:37:26.040 --> 2:37:30.120]  I just googled what he said and that's why things are so fast moving here and I appreciate
[2:37:30.120 --> 2:37:33.160]  your call Don bringing up serious issues here.
[2:37:33.160 --> 2:37:38.520]  Yeah I heard yesterday afternoon that the mansion had partially burned down yesterday, confirmed
[2:37:38.520 --> 2:37:41.840]  it yesterday afternoon, got on the plane, flew back and been focused on Bilderberg what
[2:37:41.840 --> 2:37:46.360]  they were doing and you've got the governor's mansion surrounded by a huge fence, surrounded
[2:37:46.360 --> 2:37:52.040]  by state police, guards, the governor doesn't even live there, I know they've been doing
[2:37:52.040 --> 2:37:56.920]  some construction on it and now here's the headline, Dallas Morning News, arson suspected
[2:37:56.920 --> 2:38:01.600]  in Texas governor's mansion blaze, federal investigators will scour the charred remains,
[2:38:01.600 --> 2:38:07.640]  why is it Texas doing it, and governor's mansion today for more clues after an apparent arsonist
[2:38:07.640 --> 2:38:12.480]  nearly demolished the 152 year old home for heads of state ranging from Sam Houston to
[2:38:12.480 --> 2:38:13.960]  George W. Bush.
[2:38:13.960 --> 2:38:17.520]  There's no indication that the catastrophic blaze which ravaged the yellow, the elegant
[2:38:17.520 --> 2:38:25.040]  white mansion, cratered its roof and covered its signature columns with thick soot early
[2:38:25.040 --> 2:38:32.040]  Sunday was intended to target Governor Rick Perry or First Lady Anita Perry, the mansion
[2:38:32.040 --> 2:38:37.080]  was undergoing extensive renovations so they basically say arson and I guess yeah here
[2:38:37.080 --> 2:38:41.320]  they are freaking out about terrorism in another report, just any excuse, I mean if lightning
[2:38:41.320 --> 2:38:45.720]  strikes a tree they say why al-Qaeda did it doesn't exist, the mansion was undergoing
[2:38:45.720 --> 2:38:49.840]  extensive renovations including installation of fire sprinkler system, the parries were
[2:38:49.840 --> 2:38:54.520]  living elsewhere, the mansion's valuable art and antiques were in storage, oh that sounds
[2:38:54.520 --> 2:38:58.880]  just like the Pentagon where they struck the part that they just rebuilt and hardly anybody
[2:38:58.880 --> 2:39:03.160]  was in, state authorities say they found clear evidence that the fire was set, raising questions
[2:39:03.160 --> 2:39:07.920]  about the alertness of the mansions around the clock security details, well on a separate
[2:39:07.920 --> 2:39:12.320]  building they've got everything covered in surveillance and come on let's see some evidence,
[2:39:12.320 --> 2:39:17.680]  let's see some proof, oh man this is so sick, so far there has been no arrest in the state
[2:39:17.680 --> 2:39:21.920]  fire marshal is asking the public to help identify potential suspects and maybe you're
[2:39:21.920 --> 2:39:29.240]  right Don they'll probably end up saying it's, man it just never ends, while the national
[2:39:29.240 --> 2:39:33.040]  response unit from the US Department of Justice hits the ground today, we've got to send cameras
[2:39:33.040 --> 2:39:39.120]  down there folks, we just don't have the people, heartbroken state preservationists are gathering
[2:39:39.120 --> 2:39:45.360]  their own forces fearful that the Greek revival home, it's Masonic, will be further damaged
[2:39:45.360 --> 2:39:49.480]  in the criminal investigation, this is something we couldn't possibly afford to lose, said
[2:39:49.480 --> 2:39:55.160]  Larry Oaks, now you don't care about testing drugs on CPS children until they die but care
[2:39:55.160 --> 2:39:59.560]  about some art, the governor and Ms. Perry who have lived in the Austin area and rental
[2:39:59.560 --> 2:40:03.200]  homes since the mansions renovations began are traveling in Europe and returned to Tuzi
[2:40:03.200 --> 2:40:10.840]  to Texas, well that's just amazing that this is going on, do we have Alan Watt, okay I
[2:40:10.840 --> 2:40:14.720]  know we have a call in Australia, Al will try to get to you first in a little while,
[2:40:14.720 --> 2:40:19.560]  David, Mike and others, so much going on, I'm going to recap Bilderberg and what happened
[2:40:19.560 --> 2:40:26.400]  there before the show ends today, but yeah, we'll see if Don's right, they try to blame
[2:40:26.400 --> 2:40:34.600]  this on the Mormons, just absolutely amazing what's going on here, but this thing is covered
[2:40:34.600 --> 2:40:42.680]  by a big fence, it's locked, no one can get into it, it has as many as 20 security people
[2:40:42.680 --> 2:40:47.960]  there admittedly, a whole, there's a big house on the grounds full of DPS, I have been driving
[2:40:47.960 --> 2:40:53.200]  by the governor's mansion for end game because I wanted nighttime shots of the governor's
[2:40:53.200 --> 2:40:57.640]  mansion and so we drove by, got out with the camera, got back in the car, the state police
[2:40:57.640 --> 2:41:02.840]  ran out in the street and jumped in front of our car and then Austin cops pulled up
[2:41:02.840 --> 2:41:09.400]  and laughed when it was me and drove off, I mean there is just, there's no way somebody
[2:41:09.400 --> 2:41:13.960]  went in there and set this, or they'll probably find some mental patient that's on the state
[2:41:13.960 --> 2:41:18.080]  payroll who they claim did it, who they'll have say they did it, I mean this is just,
[2:41:18.080 --> 2:41:22.800]  this just never ends, okay let's go ahead and go to Alan Watt for the rest of this
[2:41:22.800 --> 2:41:26.320]  hour into the next hour because I wanted to get him on about all the things that are
[2:41:26.320 --> 2:41:30.880]  happening, the Bilderberg group, the global elite and I wanted to talk to him about what
[2:41:30.880 --> 2:41:35.440]  he thinks is on their agenda in the near future, Alan Watt of course is a researcher
[2:41:35.440 --> 2:41:42.080]  under all their occultic activities, their Masonic Babylon mission religion system and
[2:41:42.080 --> 2:41:44.520]  Alan it's good to have you back on with us.
[2:41:44.520 --> 2:41:47.200]  That's a pleasure to be here.
[2:41:47.200 --> 2:41:50.320]  What do you think about the successful coverage of Bilderberg group this year and the fact
[2:41:50.320 --> 2:41:55.520]  that my wife's getting threats, I'm getting threats now, threats of raping or threats
[2:41:55.520 --> 2:42:00.200]  of people calling up saying they're women and I've gotten them pregnant, that means
[2:42:00.200 --> 2:42:02.960]  we must have really upset the Bilderberg boys.
[2:42:02.960 --> 2:42:07.680]  You know defamation is the first thing that they've always done on a target and that was
[2:42:07.680 --> 2:42:13.400]  the standard techniques they used on all sites during the Cold War and they still use it
[2:42:13.400 --> 2:42:20.400]  yet, that's the easiest way to discredit people is to try and smear them or set them up and
[2:42:20.400 --> 2:42:26.120]  so I'm not surprised at all because we are in a time, this is all coming down now, this
[2:42:26.120 --> 2:42:32.240]  is a lot of planning for hundreds of years coming to a close now as we transform from
[2:42:32.240 --> 2:42:39.520]  one era and age and way of living into a new preplanned way of living and people are not
[2:42:39.520 --> 2:42:46.560]  going to like this new system and the big boys have planned to handle the strife, the
[2:42:46.560 --> 2:42:52.400]  30 years of riots they see coming and they'll be building up massive police and military
[2:42:52.400 --> 2:42:57.760]  to deal with this for years under the guise of drugs and so on, the war on drugs.
[2:42:57.760 --> 2:43:03.600]  So we're coming to a stage where we're going into a controlled society, they want all of
[2:43:03.600 --> 2:43:10.760]  the same features you have in a war, a natural war such as rationing for food, gasoline and
[2:43:10.760 --> 2:43:16.680]  everything else and they want a control, because that's the only time and Carol quickly put
[2:43:16.680 --> 2:43:21.120]  this quite plainly, he said we can get more done in five years of war with the people,
[2:43:21.120 --> 2:43:26.640]  do what they're told are all obedient, that we can in 50 years of peace with propaganda.
[2:43:26.640 --> 2:43:31.800]  So war time scenario is what we're going through and they're not invincible, I want
[2:43:31.800 --> 2:43:38.080]  you to talk about what this rationing scenario, what this global carbon tax is going to look
[2:43:38.080 --> 2:43:44.320]  like, but let me just tell you this just broke today, we have sources inside Bilderberg,
[2:43:44.320 --> 2:43:49.400]  this has been double triple confirmed, they're very upset about it, they're not invincible
[2:43:49.400 --> 2:43:55.560]  and that is that they are fighting about whether they want to attack Iran or not, believing
[2:43:55.560 --> 2:44:00.400]  it's waking the people up too fast, they believe they started the rationing too quickly, they're
[2:44:00.400 --> 2:44:05.480]  arguing that they're enslaving us too fast, that it's going to form too much of a resistance,
[2:44:05.480 --> 2:44:09.200]  but they all agree they've got to get the implantable microchip in us, because they've
[2:44:09.200 --> 2:44:13.560]  now done a lot of the troops to track every purchase, every sale we make, to fully track
[2:44:13.560 --> 2:44:18.560]  everywhere we go for their safety, because they're upset that they don't have the grid
[2:44:18.560 --> 2:44:23.920]  in place yet, they believe that the riots and things might get too bad as they're dehumanizing
[2:44:23.920 --> 2:44:28.120]  us and exterminating us and euthanizing us and that they don't believe their surveillance
[2:44:28.120 --> 2:44:29.640]  grid is fully in place yet.
[2:44:29.640 --> 2:44:34.400]  Yeah, even though they've been tracking most people who are already cashless, they don't
[2:44:34.400 --> 2:44:39.680]  use money anymore, they don't use cash, they use credit cards and so on and debit cards
[2:44:39.680 --> 2:44:43.320]  and they've been tracking them since they first gave those cards to the people, so you're
[2:44:43.320 --> 2:44:47.880]  quite right, everyone you see in a totally controlled society, every single person must
[2:44:47.880 --> 2:44:52.400]  be completely predictable and that's where they haven't got it quite up to scratch yet
[2:44:52.400 --> 2:44:57.880]  without a chip and so they're very, very edgy and believe you me, they'll do anything and
[2:44:57.880 --> 2:45:02.480]  they also always have plan A, B, C and D on the go at the same time because they can afford
[2:45:02.480 --> 2:45:08.000]  to hire as many think tanks as they wish to work on every aspect of society, so we're
[2:45:08.000 --> 2:45:13.240]  in for a rough time regardless of which way they go and these boys will not give up because
[2:45:13.240 --> 2:45:17.760]  we ask them nicely and guarantee you that.
[2:45:17.760 --> 2:45:24.880]  Now when the Texas Governor's mansion got burned down, it is 25 to 30 yards, space around
[2:45:24.880 --> 2:45:32.920]  a huge spike top, rod iron fence, there are state police and DPS intelligence all over
[2:45:32.920 --> 2:45:38.360]  the grounds and they're now claiming that somebody burned it down and that quote terrorist
[2:45:38.360 --> 2:45:44.600]  are involved and the quote feds are there investigating, Austin's a major capital of
[2:45:44.600 --> 2:45:47.200]  resistance to the tyranny.
[2:45:47.200 --> 2:45:48.960]  This stinks to high heaven, what do you say?
[2:45:48.960 --> 2:45:52.360]  Well, there's no doubt, there's no doubt at all, but the first thing I'd do was check
[2:45:52.360 --> 2:45:57.760]  in to see if this particular person needed some insurance money before they start blaming
[2:45:57.760 --> 2:46:02.840]  everyone else for it because that's generally what happens, be quite right, they must start
[2:46:02.840 --> 2:46:07.760]  this internal terrorist scenario to get us thinking there's terrorists all amongst us
[2:46:07.760 --> 2:46:11.400]  and to justify their actions and you're quite right, Texas is a big player in this, they
[2:46:11.400 --> 2:46:12.920]  have to start bringing it down.
[2:46:12.920 --> 2:46:17.800]  And by the way, that came up from two separate sources, one that works for Bilderberg and
[2:46:17.800 --> 2:46:24.320]  other source, that they said we've got to start the wide al-Qaeda movement now, we've
[2:46:24.320 --> 2:46:29.240]  got to say that al-Qaeda is quote red-haired blue-eyed, blonde-haired blue-eyed, that everybody's
[2:46:29.240 --> 2:46:34.280]  al-Qaeda, we've got to start this now to get the chip and tell the people that there's
[2:46:34.280 --> 2:46:36.000]  now domestic terrorism.
[2:46:36.000 --> 2:46:40.360]  So I would look in the next year for more Oklahoma cities, this is a major indicator
[2:46:40.360 --> 2:46:45.640]  because they are the top of the pyramid at Bilderberg, this is them, remember we can
[2:46:45.640 --> 2:46:49.320]  predict wars, predict gas prices off what they say, that now they're getting ready to
[2:46:49.320 --> 2:46:53.200]  move into domestic terrorism to blame it on the mainline population, they've built up
[2:46:53.200 --> 2:46:57.040]  the Homeland Security apparatus, now they're going to phase out al-Qaeda and claim it's
[2:46:57.040 --> 2:46:58.040]  domestic groups.
[2:46:58.040 --> 2:47:01.600]  Yeah, they had to do that because there was nothing to do with al-Qaeda as we know, it
[2:47:01.600 --> 2:47:07.840]  was a strategy that even printed what they wanted to do 50 years, 80 years ago and major
[2:47:07.840 --> 2:47:14.080]  think tanks and even Joe Average that knows very little apart from what's on television
[2:47:14.080 --> 2:47:18.640]  as it is now getting kind of spooked with everything that's happening and he realizes
[2:47:18.640 --> 2:47:21.320]  he is the target, so now they must justify it.
[2:47:21.320 --> 2:47:27.240]  And I read that article where this says yes, now al-Qaeda has more western-ized recruits
[2:47:27.240 --> 2:47:29.840]  with the western features, etc.
[2:47:29.840 --> 2:47:36.320]  Because you know, I get people visiting from the states quite often and they get hassled
[2:47:36.320 --> 2:47:40.200]  at the borders there regardless of what they look like, they don't look like Arabs, that's
[2:47:40.200 --> 2:47:46.320]  for sure and this has to do with the average person getting them trained to be subservient,
[2:47:46.320 --> 2:47:51.720]  obedient, bend over when they're told to do it and hop and jump and do what they're told.
[2:47:51.720 --> 2:47:56.880]  Alan, I was in D.C. for the last five, six days from Tuesday to Sunday.
[2:47:56.880 --> 2:48:00.920]  We went a couple days into D.C. to get shots of the city for the film about Bilderberg,
[2:48:00.920 --> 2:48:04.400]  how it was in D.C. on the edge of it.
[2:48:04.400 --> 2:48:09.720]  And it wasn't just us, the police and security guards were everywhere, people just walking
[2:48:09.720 --> 2:48:14.560]  around with their families with ice cream cones, they would yell at them, boss them around,
[2:48:14.560 --> 2:48:19.520]  treat them like slaves on Southwest Airlines last night, we're all just sitting there,
[2:48:19.520 --> 2:48:23.840]  people are just talking and the woman starts screaming, everyone shut up, shut up, shut
[2:48:23.840 --> 2:48:26.440]  up, I want to tell you that the flight's delayed.
[2:48:26.440 --> 2:48:32.600]  And then an hour before the plane landed, she commanded the first boarding group, which
[2:48:32.600 --> 2:48:35.480]  was half the plane, the A group, to line up.
[2:48:35.480 --> 2:48:38.600]  And then when people didn't, she said, I told you to line up.
[2:48:38.600 --> 2:48:42.920]  I mean, this is just, they've given the orders to everybody just to get us ready.
[2:48:42.920 --> 2:48:44.920]  Yes, yes they have.
[2:48:44.920 --> 2:48:48.600]  And it's training, it's constant training and see most people are frequent travelers
[2:48:48.600 --> 2:48:53.040]  on aircraft, therefore they're the first ones to be trained and bending over as I see when
[2:48:53.040 --> 2:48:56.280]  they're told to and jump and skip when they're told to.
[2:48:56.280 --> 2:49:01.720]  So everyone's being trained and now they're going into city to city travel where they
[2:49:01.720 --> 2:49:05.760]  can start setting up roadblocks, et cetera, for practicing, mind you.
[2:49:05.760 --> 2:49:10.560]  And for terrorist training, supposedly, I see a big exercise in Indianapolis coming
[2:49:10.560 --> 2:49:15.480]  up 2,300 Marines and they're going to do road checks and all the rest of it, fire off their
[2:49:15.480 --> 2:49:17.480]  weapons according to the disclosure.
[2:49:17.480 --> 2:49:22.040]  They're going to be stopping real cars, real people and searching them.
[2:49:22.040 --> 2:49:23.320]  And asking them where you're going.
[2:49:23.320 --> 2:49:26.640]  And it's the same questions they're asking at the border, where are you going, I'm going
[2:49:26.640 --> 2:49:30.880]  to the next state, who are you going to see, who are you visiting, how long will you stay,
[2:49:30.880 --> 2:49:32.920]  are you sure that's where you're really going.
[2:49:32.920 --> 2:49:37.760]  And they're also, this is the odd part about it, they're also going to use or get practice
[2:49:37.760 --> 2:49:39.760]  in using non-lethal weaponry.
[2:49:39.760 --> 2:49:44.200]  Well, how can you practice using non-lethal weaponry?
[2:49:44.200 --> 2:49:47.720]  Alan, please continue breaking this down.
[2:49:47.720 --> 2:49:49.000]  Break down this training.
[2:49:49.000 --> 2:49:50.880]  Yeah, the training is amazing.
[2:49:50.880 --> 2:49:56.080]  I mean, we've all been trained mainly through television, that helps too.
[2:49:56.080 --> 2:50:00.080]  There's a whole series of television dramas on now on the border.
[2:50:00.080 --> 2:50:05.160]  Even Canada put big money into making one series, and that's government money backing
[2:50:05.160 --> 2:50:09.400]  it, about all terrorism is everywhere, it's all amongst you.
[2:50:09.400 --> 2:50:16.440]  And so that first basically gets everyone into that mode of, my God, they're actually
[2:50:16.440 --> 2:50:17.440]  out there.
[2:50:17.440 --> 2:50:21.240]  Because we're trained mainly through fiction, and then you get the major media backing it
[2:50:21.240 --> 2:50:27.640]  up with this propaganda, and then they start to see real troops on the streets.
[2:50:27.640 --> 2:50:31.920]  And so this all works together to condition us into a complete war mode.
[2:50:31.920 --> 2:50:36.600]  And in a war mode, once it starts, if we don't hang on to how it used to be, then we're completely
[2:50:36.600 --> 2:50:37.600]  lost.
[2:50:37.600 --> 2:50:38.600]  We're now flowing.
[2:50:38.600 --> 2:50:43.520]  That's it, we are going into bondage, prepare yourselves, that goes for you police too.
[2:50:43.520 --> 2:50:45.640]  This is going to destroy your family's future.
[2:50:45.640 --> 2:50:46.640]  Beware.
[2:50:46.640 --> 2:50:49.080]  We'll be right back with Alan Watt.
[2:50:49.080 --> 2:50:53.480]  When I learned that the accumulation of acidic waste was the likely cause of my painful joints,
[2:50:53.480 --> 2:50:57.600]  lack of energy and weight gain, I knew I would have to change to a more alkaline diet.
[2:50:57.600 --> 2:50:59.840]  But it just seems so difficult.
[2:50:59.840 --> 2:51:04.960]  Then a friend suggested I try a Jupiter water ionizer from SnyderHealth.com and detox my
[2:51:04.960 --> 2:51:09.840]  body even before I changed my diet by drinking alkaline ionized water.
[2:51:09.840 --> 2:51:10.840]  Drinking water?
[2:51:10.840 --> 2:51:12.520]  Now that's something I can handle.
[2:51:12.520 --> 2:51:15.960]  The guys at SnyderHealth took the time to explain all of the different options and helped me
[2:51:15.960 --> 2:51:18.080]  choose the ionizer that was right for me.
[2:51:18.080 --> 2:51:22.040]  I used my new Jupiter ionizer for everything, for drinking, for cooking.
[2:51:22.040 --> 2:51:26.240]  And since I've been drinking the water, I have more energy, my joint pains are gone,
[2:51:26.240 --> 2:51:30.400]  and I already lost seven pounds, and my skin looks great.
[2:51:30.400 --> 2:51:37.360]  Give them a call today at 877-356-2508 to find out which ionizer is right for you.

[2:51:48.920 --> 2:51:53.400]  Now from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in internet history comes
[2:51:53.400 --> 2:51:59.600]  the long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut, an entirely new two-hour film that completely
[2:51:59.600 --> 2:52:02.040]  destroys the official fable forever.
[2:52:02.040 --> 2:52:06.360]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation in which
[2:52:06.360 --> 2:52:11.160]  family members receive answers to their questions, and the true perpetrators of the surrender's
[2:52:11.160 --> 2:52:13.080]  crime are brought to justice.
[2:52:13.080 --> 2:52:16.560]  Loose Change Final Cut is the ultimate 9-11 expose.
[2:52:16.560 --> 2:52:21.000]  From hijackers being trained at U.S. military bases to bombs in the buildings, Loose Change
[2:52:21.000 --> 2:52:24.360]  Final Cut is the one 9-11 film everyone must see.

[2:52:38.440 --> 2:52:40.040]  hundreds of other titles.
[2:52:40.040 --> 2:52:42.800]  We're in a no-holds-bar information war.
[2:52:42.800 --> 2:52:47.200]  Truth is our weapon, and PrisonPlanet.com has the tools you need to take the fight back
[2:52:47.200 --> 2:52:48.200]  to Big Brother.
[2:52:48.200 --> 2:52:53.320]  Hello, I'm Dr. Leonard Horowitz, author of 15 books on health and natural healing.
[2:52:53.320 --> 2:52:57.040]  Vaccines included, medicines kill more people every year than any illness.
[2:52:57.040 --> 2:53:01.880]  The cost of drug side effects in America is more than $200 billion annually, with a worst
[2:53:01.880 --> 2:53:03.880]  toll taken by antibiotics.
[2:53:03.880 --> 2:53:07.320]  But there is a cure for this medical madness that has remained secret.
[2:53:07.320 --> 2:53:11.880]  Oxysilver, developed by NASA scientists to keep astronauts healthy, is an evolutionary
[2:53:11.880 --> 2:53:16.720]  new dietary supplement making deadly vaccinations and antibiotics obsolete.
[2:53:16.720 --> 2:53:21.680]  Using one to two teaspoons daily boosts natural immunity without drug toxicity.
[2:53:21.680 --> 2:53:24.320]  Oxysilver combines oxygen and silver in a new way.
[2:53:24.320 --> 2:53:29.280]  The oxygen becomes a supercharged germ killer freeing your immune system to fight colds,
[2:53:29.280 --> 2:53:30.960]  flus, cancers, and more.
[2:53:30.960 --> 2:53:36.000]  Build disease defenses naturally, painlessly, powerfully, safely, and inexpensively with
[2:53:36.000 --> 2:53:37.000]  oxysilver.
[2:53:37.000 --> 2:53:47.160]  Order your supply now by calling toll-free 1-877-817-9829, that's 1-877-817-9829.
[2:53:47.160 --> 2:54:14.720]  Do it now.
[2:54:14.720 --> 2:54:22.120]  I'm going to go there, since they're all over here, the long-star state should be renamed
[2:54:22.120 --> 2:54:23.120]  Texaco.
[2:54:23.120 --> 2:54:32.120]  So long, Texas, hell of Mexico.
[2:54:32.120 --> 2:54:38.600]  Alan Watt, researcher, great fighter of the New World Order, continue with what this
[2:54:38.600 --> 2:54:39.920]  future is going to look like.
[2:54:39.920 --> 2:54:43.320]  The Bilderberg group saying they've got to get these microchips in us, and again the
[2:54:43.320 --> 2:54:47.080]  people even yelling and screaming and the police treating us all like slaves, they've
[2:54:47.080 --> 2:54:48.240]  been ordered to do this.
[2:54:48.240 --> 2:54:51.520]  They don't understand what they're doing via the compartmentalization.
[2:54:51.520 --> 2:54:58.520]  There's nothing that can be done to the general public without the compliance of the public
[2:54:58.520 --> 2:55:04.120]  and the compliance of the recruits they use and get from the public.
[2:55:04.120 --> 2:55:08.200]  This is the odd thing about it, we help them fulfill their plans.
[2:55:08.200 --> 2:55:12.240]  Every stage of it, we help them, we supply the troops, the cops, and so on.
[2:55:12.240 --> 2:55:15.680]  We supply the tax money to train them and make them paranoid.
[2:55:15.680 --> 2:55:20.280]  We supply them for the weaponry, we supply the money for the think tanks to be paid
[2:55:20.280 --> 2:55:23.080]  that puts us in bondage, and we don't realize that.
[2:55:23.080 --> 2:55:28.080]  We can stop accepting this, we can stop accepting this, and their whole plan falls apart without
[2:55:28.080 --> 2:55:29.080]  our help.
[2:55:29.080 --> 2:55:37.720]  Here's an example, how many Americans know that in mainline NASA history that L. Ron
[2:55:37.720 --> 2:55:45.440]  Hubbard and Alistair Crowley and the founder of JPL, that it was all founded by a cultist
[2:55:45.440 --> 2:55:49.120]  and that they brought the Nazis over, that's mainline history.
[2:55:49.120 --> 2:55:52.720]  How many of them know that that was set up by the Department of Defense as a separate
[2:55:52.720 --> 2:55:57.640]  adjunct, only answerable to the president and over 90% of their operations are military?
[2:55:57.640 --> 2:55:58.840]  That's just one example.
[2:55:58.840 --> 2:56:03.560]  We have this giant shadow government run by a cultist that do whatever they want and
[2:56:03.560 --> 2:56:04.960]  they're turning the world into hell.
[2:56:04.960 --> 2:56:05.960]  Can you speak to that?
[2:56:05.960 --> 2:56:10.200]  They're long-term planners, that's what the public must understand.
[2:56:10.200 --> 2:56:15.280]  They planned in centuries, and they had this part, what we're going through right now,
[2:56:15.280 --> 2:56:20.960]  they had this planned a long time ago, and we know that the Ford and Carnegie foundations
[2:56:20.960 --> 2:56:25.640]  and so on under the Rees Commission admitted their job was to help blame the Soviet system
[2:56:25.640 --> 2:56:30.440]  with the American system, so we're going through this phase and they understood the
[2:56:30.440 --> 2:56:35.240]  shake-ups that would have occurred, but this is only part of it because you've seen yourself
[2:56:35.240 --> 2:56:41.040]  at this Bilderberger meeting, they brought in some of the transhumanists, the top transhumanist
[2:56:41.040 --> 2:56:48.520]  society members, and transhumanism is to do with genetically modifying humanity or select
[2:56:48.520 --> 2:56:53.840]  people from humanity for a new species to come, which will then dominate as we, the
[2:56:53.840 --> 2:56:57.720]  old species, dies off, and this is all coming together.
[2:56:57.720 --> 2:57:02.600]  This is long-term planning, and they hope to bring in this new species of perfect slaves
[2:57:02.600 --> 2:57:04.360]  around about 30 years from now.
[2:57:04.360 --> 2:57:08.160]  And they will get the live extension themselves, and that's admitted, that's why they want
[2:57:08.160 --> 2:57:13.520]  to carry out the eugenics, the eugenicists, and the 1950s found in transhumanism.
[2:57:13.520 --> 2:57:18.920]  And these characters literally, as I say, since 1890, were taking the first census across
[2:57:18.920 --> 2:57:26.080]  the Western world, and to do with your hereditary affiliations and so on, and taking records
[2:57:26.080 --> 2:57:31.200]  for this, all to do with what was coming up today, for those who would allow to live and
[2:57:31.200 --> 2:57:35.800]  those who will die, who must die, they say, they will not bring through what they call
[2:57:35.800 --> 2:57:42.640]  the useless eaters into the new system, and 30 years time through all this chaos, 30 years
[2:57:42.640 --> 2:57:47.360]  of chaos supposedly, that they have planned and they've admitted to from the Department
[2:57:47.360 --> 2:57:52.760]  of Defense in Britain, and 30 years time, they will bring in this new species if we
[2:57:52.760 --> 2:57:55.080]  allow it and go along with it.
[2:57:55.080 --> 2:57:59.920]  Well, there's no doubt in my mind that they'll produce a patsy for this fire at the mansion.
[2:57:59.920 --> 2:58:05.760]  They're saying it's arson, they'll use this as a pretext to set up a police state here
[2:58:05.760 --> 2:58:11.560]  in central Texas, we've always said Texas is a major target, a total stunt, you try
[2:58:11.560 --> 2:58:16.320]  to walk up to the gates of that thing, and they will arrest you.
[2:58:16.320 --> 2:58:21.160]  Now they're going to put armored concrete all around it like the White House, start
[2:58:21.160 --> 2:58:24.960]  the harassment in downtown Austin, it's because they're tired of being bullhorned down there
[2:58:24.960 --> 2:58:38.640]  that they've burned down their own mansion, shame on them.
[2:58:38.640 --> 2:58:42.680]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees, the forces of globalism are destroying national
[2:58:42.680 --> 2:58:46.640]  sovereignty worldwide, but in Liberty's darkest hour there is hope.
[2:58:46.640 --> 2:58:50.280]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up, it is essential
[2:58:50.280 --> 2:58:54.400]  that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the new world order
[2:58:54.400 --> 2:58:55.400]  master plan.
[2:58:55.400 --> 2:58:59.680]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[2:58:59.680 --> 2:59:04.880]  In the Info War, PrisonPlanet.tv is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.
[2:59:04.880 --> 2:59:10.360]  PrisonPlanet.tv is a vault of forbidden information, all 18 of my documentary films can be downloaded

[2:59:14.600 --> 2:59:15.600]  others.
[2:59:15.600 --> 2:59:19.680]  Thousands of special video reports from tainted vaccines to martial law can be found in this
[2:59:19.680 --> 2:59:21.120]  online video library.
[2:59:21.120 --> 2:59:25.280]  By weekly news, television broadcast, thousands of exclusive audio interviews and so much
[2:59:25.280 --> 2:59:26.280]  more.
[2:59:26.280 --> 2:59:32.040]  The Info War is waiting for you to set it free, join PrisonPlanet.tv, burn the info bombs
[2:59:32.040 --> 2:59:37.000]  to disc, put them on the file sharing networks, bring down the new world order.
[2:59:37.000 --> 2:59:51.800]  PrisonPlanet.tv, waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCM radio network.
[2:59:51.800 --> 2:59:57.160]  Month ago, in a review that the new mission of the state police in Texas, the second largest
[2:59:57.160 --> 3:00:01.400]  state police in the country, would be fighting terrorists.
[3:00:01.400 --> 3:00:05.520]  They said terrorists are everywhere, there is new white al-Qaeda everywhere, everyone
[3:00:05.520 --> 3:00:09.640]  must be watched, the state police must be federalized.
[3:00:09.640 --> 3:00:15.960]  Then magically, they claim that someone scaled iron gates with security personnel everywhere.
[3:00:15.960 --> 3:00:19.560]  You walk up near it at night, they all pop out of the bushes, literally this has happened
[3:00:19.560 --> 3:00:23.520]  to us and we're just there to shoot video of it or bullhorn them, and was able to then
[3:00:23.520 --> 3:00:29.000]  set a fire up against the door, and then fire trucks took a long time to arrive, oh they
[3:00:29.000 --> 3:00:32.880]  couldn't get hooked up to water and oh it was allowed to burn, and now they're saying
[3:00:32.880 --> 3:00:38.840]  see we're going to fight terrorists now, and this is so obvious, Alan when you know how
[3:00:38.840 --> 3:00:44.400]  they operate, it is so obvious, I predict they're going to grab some mentally ill person
[3:00:44.400 --> 3:00:47.200]  who'll confess to it, Alan what do you say?
[3:00:47.200 --> 3:00:51.240]  They could do that or they do have lots of patsies, there's a lot of mind control out
[3:00:51.240 --> 3:00:58.480]  there, I don't know if the public know this but MI6 for instance in Britain had authorized
[3:00:58.480 --> 3:01:05.080]  psychiatrists as far back as the 50s to do experiments on people privately, visit the
[3:01:05.080 --> 3:01:10.560]  clinics or else the doctors, the consulting room, or in hospitals.
[3:01:10.560 --> 3:01:13.720]  That's right, you go in thinking you're seeing a shrink and it's a government operative,
[3:01:13.720 --> 3:01:14.720]  that's admitted.
[3:01:14.720 --> 3:01:18.720]  That's right, now we know the same thing happened in Britain with Hamilton, the man who ended
[3:01:18.720 --> 3:01:23.600]  up going to school and shooting a bunch of children, he was seen as a psychiatrist who
[3:01:23.600 --> 3:01:30.360]  had worked with the British government and worked with special air service, and we know
[3:01:30.360 --> 3:01:35.040]  that the police never gave a license over there, if you had anything on your record,
[3:01:35.040 --> 3:01:38.640]  and this man Hamilton was a known pedophile and so on, the police visited him before.
[3:01:38.640 --> 3:01:40.800]  That's right, he was tied in with the Masons.
[3:01:40.800 --> 3:01:47.560]  Yes, and then it was a British Lord who when his license was turned down, a British Lord
[3:01:47.560 --> 3:01:53.120]  intervened and told them to grant permission for him to have a handgun license.
[3:01:53.120 --> 3:01:56.200]  That way they could then totally man guns, which they did.
[3:01:56.200 --> 3:01:59.680]  Look, there's no doubt here, this is a Reichstag fire.
[3:01:59.680 --> 3:02:04.320]  They have fire bombed the Reichstag, we said for years it was the government now, it's
[3:02:04.320 --> 3:02:08.800]  been declassified just six months ago, five months ago, admitting that Marinus Vanderloob,
[3:02:08.800 --> 3:02:12.040]  the mentally ill person they threw out neck and on the side of the street didn't do it.
[3:02:12.040 --> 3:02:16.640]  Herman Goering did it and Hitler used, oh look, they've burned down the Capitol building.
[3:02:16.640 --> 3:02:20.000]  This is a Reichstag, this is really bad, I knew they were going to do this.
[3:02:20.000 --> 3:02:24.880]  The danger here is they might find someone or already have been working on someone who
[3:02:24.880 --> 3:02:30.520]  will say he belongs to a Patriot group and this is his revenge and that will start the
[3:02:30.520 --> 3:02:32.920]  bowel rowing, this is what they want.
[3:02:32.920 --> 3:02:38.560]  Well, I tell you, I feel a great earnest in my spirit, in my soul, in my heart.
[3:02:38.560 --> 3:02:42.680]  I mean, we're up there, Bilderberg's calling up, threatening me, harassing me, doing all
[3:02:42.680 --> 3:02:43.680]  this stuff.
[3:02:43.680 --> 3:02:47.600]  I'm flying back, they've burnt down the governor's mansion.
[3:02:47.600 --> 3:02:50.520]  Our movement gets bigger and bigger here and look, terrorists, you're not getting away
[3:02:50.520 --> 3:02:51.520]  with it.
[3:02:51.520 --> 3:02:52.520]  I mean, just bottom up.
[3:02:52.520 --> 3:02:57.080]  This is so asinine that someone could climb those spiked fences and go burn it down and
[3:02:57.080 --> 3:03:03.200]  they're saying, oh well, quote, there was somebody here to potentially set the fire,
[3:03:03.200 --> 3:03:09.200]  he declined to give more specifics, State Fire Marshal Paul Maldobano said early evidence
[3:03:09.200 --> 3:03:14.360]  including interviews to security personnel, bystanders and some downtown residents indicated
[3:03:14.360 --> 3:03:16.880]  there was somebody here to potentially set the fire.
[3:03:16.880 --> 3:03:17.880]  So somebody supposedly...
[3:03:17.880 --> 3:03:21.880]  They have cameras, they have cameras all over that place.
[3:03:21.880 --> 3:03:23.360]  These people never ran, man.
[3:03:23.360 --> 3:03:28.520]  We know they bombed, the little bomb at the military recruiting center and then now they
[3:03:28.520 --> 3:03:32.880]  got people out with signs on the street saying we did it, 9-11 Truth, saying a group that
[3:03:32.880 --> 3:03:37.680]  I've basically energized, we are changed, we would look, we'd ask you saying, I mean,
[3:03:37.680 --> 3:03:39.200]  it's getting obvious, Alan.
[3:03:39.200 --> 3:03:42.600]  It's obvious, but then it might be true, I mean, they have put out statements already
[3:03:42.600 --> 3:03:51.760]  that the Pentagon set up a panel to go over all talk show hosts, this is the paper, and
[3:03:51.760 --> 3:03:55.760]  to go over all your previous talks to see if you've ever said anything they could incite
[3:03:55.760 --> 3:04:00.680]  riots and this was in mainstream newspapers in Canada here.
[3:04:00.680 --> 3:04:03.480]  That's right and then they are going to come arrest you on the pickup list, which they
[3:04:03.480 --> 3:04:04.480]  now admit.
[3:04:04.480 --> 3:04:08.800]  Well, good luck to them, you murdering bastards, you're not going to get away with it.
[3:04:08.800 --> 3:04:15.000]  This is our technique and they must find someone or produce someone or create someone who will
[3:04:15.000 --> 3:04:19.280]  take responsibility for this fire and say, yeah, I belong to a Patriot group and I listen
[3:04:19.280 --> 3:04:22.840]  to these shows.
[3:04:22.840 --> 3:04:26.360]  It is absolutely amazing, Alan Watts, stay there.
[3:04:26.360 --> 3:04:32.120]  Folks, this isn't a game, it isn't a joke, DPS, some of it were resisting, saying making
[3:04:32.120 --> 3:04:34.440]  their main mission, fighting terror.
[3:04:34.440 --> 3:04:38.120]  That means pulling you over, running checkpoints, searching you, spying on you, following you
[3:04:38.120 --> 3:04:40.280]  and staging more terror attacks.
[3:04:40.280 --> 3:04:43.840]  They're going to turn the military cadres loose on us here like it's Baghdad.
[3:04:43.840 --> 3:04:46.040]  We'll be right back.
[3:04:46.040 --> 3:04:50.680]  Are you fed up with all the side effects of chemicals in your shampoos and detergents?
[3:04:50.680 --> 3:04:55.560]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[3:04:55.560 --> 3:04:57.160]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here.
[3:04:57.160 --> 3:05:00.840]  Why not go back to basics and be safe with Kalbin Pure Soaps?

[3:05:50.520 --> 3:05:55.000]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[3:05:55.000 --> 3:06:01.080]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group, but their objective being world domination.
[3:06:01.080 --> 3:06:04.240]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[3:06:04.240 --> 3:06:10.160]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80%
[3:06:10.160 --> 3:06:14.600]  of humanity is at hand.
[3:06:14.600 --> 3:06:19.560]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[3:06:19.560 --> 3:06:23.920]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[3:06:23.920 --> 3:06:26.600]  Bilderberg is making great progress for the world government.
[3:06:26.600 --> 3:06:29.720]  Most people have no idea, they're not after money, they have all the money they need.
[3:06:29.720 --> 3:06:30.720]  They're after power.
[3:06:30.720 --> 3:06:31.720]  That's their affidavit.

[3:06:39.360 --> 3:06:40.360]  In game, blueprint for global enslavement.
[3:06:40.360 --> 3:06:41.360]  You have been warned.
[3:06:41.360 --> 3:06:49.640]  Hi neighbor, no matter when the time comes to survive on our food supply, every single
[3:06:49.640 --> 3:06:52.640]  one of us who have prepared will have two regrets.
[3:06:52.640 --> 3:06:56.720]  Even those who haven't wasted a single penny on Christmas, birthdays and vacations in order
[3:06:56.720 --> 3:06:59.120]  to store all the food possible.
[3:06:59.120 --> 3:07:03.040]  Even those who have sold stuff and taken on part-time jobs to buy food.
[3:07:03.040 --> 3:07:06.760]  Even those who have traded their gold while it will still buy food.
[3:07:06.760 --> 3:07:10.840]  Yes, we will have been called stupid, crazy and foolish.
[3:07:10.840 --> 3:07:14.960]  When folks won't be able to afford food and there won't be any food for any amount of
[3:07:14.960 --> 3:07:16.040]  money.
[3:07:16.040 --> 3:07:18.680]  We will still have two regrets.
[3:07:18.680 --> 3:07:22.720]  We will regret that we didn't get more serious about more food sooner.
[3:07:22.720 --> 3:07:26.360]  We will deeply regret that we didn't get enough food.
[3:07:26.360 --> 3:07:30.920]  Putting off emergency food preparations to celebrate the holidays will be the most dangerous
[3:07:30.920 --> 3:07:33.960]  decision that some of us will ever make.
[3:07:33.960 --> 3:07:40.960]  Call 800-409-5633 on the web, efoodsdirect.com.
[3:07:40.960 --> 3:07:46.480]  800-409-5633.
[3:07:46.480 --> 3:07:49.120]  Please the T-Rex of political talk.
[3:07:49.120 --> 3:07:52.480]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[3:07:52.480 --> 3:07:58.080]  Feds shut things down, quote, with the safety of the governor's mansion and then called
[3:07:58.080 --> 3:08:01.520]  in their people keeping the state folks out of it.
[3:08:01.520 --> 3:08:05.840]  This thing just follows every other action they've done in the past.
[3:08:05.840 --> 3:08:09.960]  Alan, I know I'm focusing a lot on this, on them burning down much of the governor's
[3:08:09.960 --> 3:08:10.960]  mansion.
[3:08:10.960 --> 3:08:16.040]  They're admitting, I'm reading more articles, that there was, quote, people in the building
[3:08:16.040 --> 3:08:20.080]  that they let in and that someone that they let in, they think set the fire.
[3:08:20.080 --> 3:08:24.880]  I mean, how obvious, they always open the door, they always protect whoever supposedly
[3:08:24.880 --> 3:08:25.880]  they blame.
[3:08:25.880 --> 3:08:28.200]  I mean, it's always the same, Alan.
[3:08:28.200 --> 3:08:34.080]  You probably couldn't move anywhere in that mansion without being on a video camera and
[3:08:34.080 --> 3:08:35.080]  having it recorded.
[3:08:35.080 --> 3:08:38.080]  So they know who did what.
[3:08:38.080 --> 3:08:39.080]  And that's filled.
[3:08:39.080 --> 3:08:42.520]  It's filled with million and two million dollar famous paintings.
[3:08:42.520 --> 3:08:44.600]  I mean, it's just filled, filled.
[3:08:44.600 --> 3:08:48.720]  They're not going to let those workers in there.
[3:08:48.720 --> 3:08:51.280]  They admit it was all under surveillance.
[3:08:51.280 --> 3:08:52.280]  Of course.
[3:08:52.280 --> 3:08:54.840]  And here they are going out asking the public if they saw anything.
[3:08:54.840 --> 3:08:55.840]  This is a joke.
[3:08:55.840 --> 3:08:56.840]  Yeah.
[3:08:56.840 --> 3:08:57.840]  Yeah.
[3:08:57.840 --> 3:09:01.200]  Go out and ask the public, did you see anything when the whole thing's got at least a hundred
[3:09:01.200 --> 3:09:02.200]  cameras on it?
[3:09:02.200 --> 3:09:03.200]  Yes, exactly.
[3:09:03.200 --> 3:09:08.760]  What do you think we ought to do, Alan, about this?
[3:09:08.760 --> 3:09:14.440]  I think I'd watch it off well closely and get right in there when you start to hint
[3:09:14.440 --> 3:09:19.600]  at who they think may have been behind it, which of course will be the Patriot community.
[3:09:19.600 --> 3:09:23.600]  So you're predicting they're going to claim that the Anti-New World Order crowd did this?
[3:09:23.600 --> 3:09:24.600]  No doubt.
[3:09:24.600 --> 3:09:27.080]  In fact, anything that happens today will get blamed on numbers.
[3:09:27.080 --> 3:09:30.120]  In fact, even if it was a real accident, it would be awfully handy.
[3:09:30.120 --> 3:09:32.240]  They wouldn't miss the opportunity.
[3:09:32.240 --> 3:09:33.240]  They've got to...
[3:09:33.240 --> 3:09:35.200]  It's a general public.
[3:09:35.200 --> 3:09:37.280]  It's not the listeners to these shows that they've got to convince.
[3:09:37.280 --> 3:09:38.280]  It's a general public.
[3:09:38.280 --> 3:09:43.880]  They've got to convince the Joe Average that we're under tremendous attack and people
[3:09:43.880 --> 3:09:48.400]  are all around you, terrorists are all around you, they're everywhere, and they must get
[3:09:48.400 --> 3:09:51.160]  this mode going, this mode of thinking going.
[3:09:51.160 --> 3:09:56.040]  Well, Jim Tucker said that that was one of the main things being discussed inside Bilderberg
[3:09:56.040 --> 3:10:00.000]  was how, again, to say that blonde-haired blue-eyed al-Qaeda is everywhere.
[3:10:00.000 --> 3:10:01.000]  Exactly.
[3:10:01.000 --> 3:10:06.600]  And then magically this happens while the Bilderberg group is meeting at 2 a.m. Sunday morning.
[3:10:06.600 --> 3:10:07.600]  Yes.
[3:10:07.600 --> 3:10:11.100]  As I say, when you read the Department of Defense's documents, it's on my site, there's
[3:10:11.100 --> 3:10:16.000]  90 pages there, the prediction for the next 30 years of riots.
[3:10:16.000 --> 3:10:20.760]  Now that means that Joe Average, every ethnic group is part of the terrorist problem, according
[3:10:20.760 --> 3:10:22.200]  to the big leagues.
[3:10:22.200 --> 3:10:27.400]  So every group, no matter what you belong to or think you belong to, you're already targeted
[3:10:27.400 --> 3:10:28.400]  as a terrorist.
[3:10:28.400 --> 3:10:32.440]  You're post-industrial, you're post-pathological, you don't have a function anymore, you're
[3:10:32.440 --> 3:10:35.640]  a useless eater in a service economy that's now been...
[3:10:35.640 --> 3:10:39.800]  They're pulling the plug on, and therefore they want to start eradicating us.
[3:10:39.800 --> 3:10:44.480]  And to do so, they've got to create a new system of terror and fear and obedience as
[3:10:44.480 --> 3:10:47.280]  we go down the drain quietly.
[3:10:47.280 --> 3:10:49.160]  It's getting more and more serious.
[3:10:49.160 --> 3:10:52.520]  By the middle of second, pray for this show, pray for everybody that's fighting it.
[3:10:52.520 --> 3:10:53.840]  Pray for Alan Wad.
[3:10:53.840 --> 3:10:59.160]  All of us have to spread the word 10 times harder now as fast as we can to expose what
[3:10:59.160 --> 3:11:00.160]  these people are doing.
[3:11:00.160 --> 3:11:01.360]  Alan, fire out your website.
[3:11:01.360 --> 3:11:07.360]  Yes, cuttingtothemetrics.com, and there's a separate lots of documentation on there.
[3:11:07.360 --> 3:11:11.240]  Go through the history of this and try to show the big picture, we've got to understand
[3:11:11.240 --> 3:11:12.880]  the big, big picture.
[3:11:12.880 --> 3:11:18.160]  And the long-term planning, that's the hardest thing for the average person to understand.
[3:11:18.160 --> 3:11:20.800]  These characters work inter-generationally.
[3:11:20.800 --> 3:11:23.480]  Long-term, compartmentalized system.
[3:11:23.480 --> 3:11:30.120]  Yes, and again, quickly mentioned this, you said an institute that's a foundation that's
[3:11:30.120 --> 3:11:36.000]  set up can go 200 years working on the same agenda and hiring and retiring and hiring
[3:11:36.000 --> 3:11:38.240]  and retiring and then complete that agenda.
[3:11:38.240 --> 3:11:42.160]  That's how easily it is to do with the money and the mandate.
[3:11:42.160 --> 3:11:50.760]  Okay, I want to play a short little report here.
[3:11:50.760 --> 3:12:01.280]  This is from the Associated Press today saying about the arson suspect in the fire down at
[3:12:01.280 --> 3:12:02.280]  the mansion.
[3:12:02.280 --> 3:12:06.800]  We'll go ahead and roll that for people now.
[3:12:06.800 --> 3:12:10.840]  Arson is suspected in a fire that swept through the historic Texas governor's mansion.
[3:12:10.840 --> 3:12:15.940]  No one was hurt, but the blaze left much of the 152-year-old home severely damaged.
[3:12:15.940 --> 3:12:20.280]  The roof buckled in, parts of the mansion's columns and front wall were charred, and some
[3:12:20.280 --> 3:12:25.520]  of the elaborate decorations inside were completely destroyed and cannot be replaced.
[3:12:25.520 --> 3:12:30.960]  About 100 firefighters responded when an alarm went off around two o'clock Sunday morning.
[3:12:30.960 --> 3:12:35.320]  More than six hours later, small hotspots were still burning.
[3:12:35.320 --> 3:12:38.880]  Investigators are reviewing security camera footage and talking to people who were in
[3:12:38.880 --> 3:12:41.160]  the area when the fire started.
[3:12:41.160 --> 3:12:45.080]  Texas Governor Rick Perry and his wife were out of town at the time, and authorities say
[3:12:45.080 --> 3:12:47.640]  there's no evidence they were being targeted.
[3:12:47.640 --> 3:12:52.360]  Perry and his wife moved out of the mansion last fall so it could undergo a multi-million
[3:12:52.360 --> 3:12:53.640]  dollar renovation.
[3:12:53.640 --> 3:12:56.560]  There's no immediate financial estimate of the damage.
[3:12:56.560 --> 3:12:59.880]  Carlotta Bradley, the Associated Press.
[3:12:59.880 --> 3:13:02.960]  By the way, when was the first time Rick Perry went to Bilderberg?
[3:13:02.960 --> 3:13:07.840]  Last year, and unprecedentedly, put out a press release, he's handing over the infrastructure,
[3:13:07.840 --> 3:13:13.840]  the waterways, the power plants to a known Bilderberg member who is under indictment,
[3:13:13.840 --> 3:13:18.440]  and this whole thing has Bilderberg written all over it, I mean, at just every angle.
[3:13:18.440 --> 3:13:20.400]  The more I think about it, it just keeps popping up.
[3:13:20.400 --> 3:13:21.720]  Alan, your take on that.
[3:13:21.720 --> 3:13:27.680]  Yes, Stander, once again, the main characters are not in the building at the time.
[3:13:27.680 --> 3:13:31.600]  You find this down through history with the same scenarios that are always somewhere else.
[3:13:31.600 --> 3:13:35.760]  Well, Nero burned Rome to get a police state going, and they love these fake fires.
[3:13:35.760 --> 3:13:38.280]  Yes, the same sort of idea, too.
[3:13:38.280 --> 3:13:42.880]  The terrorism was everywhere in ancient Rome, and everyone had to obey the authorities,
[3:13:42.880 --> 3:13:46.240]  and the troops were set on, and the general public is always...
[3:13:46.240 --> 3:13:47.240]  So this is standard.
[3:13:47.240 --> 3:13:50.640]  This is an ancient technique, and it generally works because it creates so much fear within
[3:13:50.640 --> 3:13:54.840]  the public who want to be safe, and the government says, we'll keep you safe, but here is the
[3:13:54.840 --> 3:14:00.920]  conditions, bend over and touch your toes, and if you want to eat, you will feed you,
[3:14:00.920 --> 3:14:03.120]  but here's the conditions for that, too.
[3:14:03.120 --> 3:14:07.760]  They have the world right now in their hands because they've given us a system, they've
[3:14:07.760 --> 3:14:10.640]  created a system of interdependence.
[3:14:10.640 --> 3:14:13.400]  That means individual interdependence.
[3:14:13.400 --> 3:14:18.200]  You're dependent on the authorities for your water, for your food being brought in, gasoline,
[3:14:18.200 --> 3:14:20.760]  everything you need to live, and they know this.
[3:14:20.760 --> 3:14:25.520]  We have the big, powerful cartels that run all of this, and this is going to be used
[3:14:25.520 --> 3:14:28.840]  as the biggest weapon very shortly.
[3:14:28.840 --> 3:14:37.120]  Alan, one area that I don't want to say I disagree with you, but I have questions, and
[3:14:37.120 --> 3:14:42.680]  I was trying to figure out exactly the full point you were trying to make.
[3:14:42.680 --> 3:14:46.760]  As I heard you do in your own radio show a few weeks ago, driving my car locally on,
[3:14:46.760 --> 3:14:55.960]  I think it was 96.3, maybe it was 90.1, and I heard you talking about how you act like
[3:14:55.960 --> 3:15:02.000]  a zombie in your own neighborhood, your own area, and that you don't talk to your neighbors,
[3:15:02.000 --> 3:15:08.680]  and that because there's spies and CIA and intelligence everywhere, and that you only
[3:15:08.680 --> 3:15:14.080]  talk out of your area, and I just wanted to say this.
[3:15:14.080 --> 3:15:18.680]  I wanted to give you a chance to respond to what I'm going to say and respond to what
[3:15:18.680 --> 3:15:23.760]  you were saying yourself, but first off, here's my take on that.
[3:15:23.760 --> 3:15:25.280]  We have to be more open than ever.
[3:15:25.280 --> 3:15:26.520]  We have to be louder than ever.
[3:15:26.520 --> 3:15:30.080]  We have to point out that they're the terrorists, they're the criminals, they're illegitimate,
[3:15:30.080 --> 3:15:35.080]  they've lied a billion times, talk to our neighbors so that they don't have a chilling
[3:15:35.080 --> 3:15:39.560]  effect so the darkness doesn't fall because as soon as that intimidation happens, they
[3:15:39.560 --> 3:15:40.560]  win.
[3:15:40.560 --> 3:15:46.800]  We know with Black Ops and from analyzing the budgets and even some of the secret budgets
[3:15:46.800 --> 3:15:52.680]  that they probably have, and now I have newscast today where they're training school children
[3:15:52.680 --> 3:15:56.240]  all over the country to tattle on their parents, their neighbors, they give them little credit
[3:15:56.240 --> 3:16:00.560]  cards and then have briefings every day about, well, who are you going to tattle on, total
[3:16:00.560 --> 3:16:01.560]  East Germany.
[3:16:01.560 --> 3:16:06.040]  So I'm not saying it's not going on, it's just that they haven't geared up yet to that
[3:16:06.040 --> 3:16:10.000]  total level, and a lot of people that work for the government I've talked to are waking
[3:16:10.000 --> 3:16:15.120]  up their upset about what's happening, a lot of them are blowing the whistle and I just
[3:16:15.120 --> 3:16:19.520]  disagree with saying you should be secretive because I found when you're secretive and
[3:16:19.520 --> 3:16:24.080]  creep around that lets the evil and the tyranny grow and I don't think I agree with you on
[3:16:24.080 --> 3:16:29.240]  the number or maybe I misunderstood the number of spies you were talking about, but if we
[3:16:29.240 --> 3:16:34.200]  get intimidated and shut up, they definitely win.
[3:16:34.200 --> 3:16:35.200]  What were you trying to say?
[3:16:35.200 --> 3:16:42.600]  Well, I was responding to someone who generally is trying to get their own relatives, et cetera,
[3:16:42.600 --> 3:16:47.640]  to wake up, and I keep telling people don't spend that kind of energy trying to wake up
[3:16:47.640 --> 3:16:53.800]  people who are telling you they don't want to know, and so you have to go further afield,
[3:16:53.800 --> 3:16:58.680]  and if you do go further afield or even locally to you got to have your facts correct, most
[3:16:58.680 --> 3:16:59.680]  people come out.
[3:16:59.680 --> 3:17:03.200]  Remember the average person out there, they watch television, that's their only source
[3:17:03.200 --> 3:17:08.280]  of media, and here you're hitting them with all this information and it's completely foreign
[3:17:08.280 --> 3:17:09.800]  to them.
[3:17:09.800 --> 3:17:13.480]  So you have to have facts here, most people go out and start rattling on what they've
[3:17:13.480 --> 3:17:20.080]  just heard on the radio, on the Patriot stations, and people look at them, they can't understand
[3:17:20.080 --> 3:17:24.000]  where you're coming from or where you're going and it's not been on the regular media.
[3:17:24.000 --> 3:17:29.040]  I try to tell people, especially here where I am here, I can't afford to know the locals
[3:17:29.040 --> 3:17:34.640]  because I know how the chain of gossip gets to the police where I am, and the British
[3:17:34.640 --> 3:17:36.480]  Commonwealth countries, this is standard.
[3:17:36.480 --> 3:17:40.960]  Well I'd agree with you, I mean if you show somebody a Ron Paul video, sometimes you get
[3:17:40.960 --> 3:17:45.200]  arrested being in the police, they have a system where if they get called, they won't
[3:17:45.200 --> 3:17:50.720]  respond to a real crime or a robbery or a shooting at the time, or your car being stolen, but
[3:17:50.720 --> 3:17:55.880]  they will then respond to just a petty rumor and it's encouraging that.
[3:17:55.880 --> 3:18:01.080]  Yes, and as I say, but here in Canada, and I know this for a fact, I know how it works,
[3:18:01.080 --> 3:18:07.080]  and this was mentioned by the way in the 1950s by Jack Elal, he said that since the 1950s
[3:18:07.080 --> 3:18:12.240]  onwards, they'd already set up the spy system, he says even if you live in a rural village
[3:18:12.240 --> 3:18:17.760]  in any of the western hemispheres, at that time they're using a car deck system, and
[3:18:17.760 --> 3:18:23.480]  even the gossip that gets to your local restaurant or cafe or whatever that you attend or the
[3:18:23.480 --> 3:18:29.760]  gas pump that you pop into, it gets put back to the police and they take records on that,
[3:18:29.760 --> 3:18:36.120]  he says this is unknown by the general public, and today it's much, much worse, so you have
[3:18:36.120 --> 3:18:37.120]  to-
[3:18:37.120 --> 3:18:40.160]  Well certainly, we're going to go to break, but right now let me play a clip from San Antonio
[3:18:40.160 --> 3:18:42.760]  News about the Tattletale squads, here it is.
[3:18:42.760 --> 3:18:47.440]  You know in the San Antonio Independent School District, the district lost a crime stopper
[3:18:47.440 --> 3:18:52.520]  program itself today, students can now help police catch other kids, and even adults committing
[3:18:52.520 --> 3:18:57.960]  crimes, and they can be rewarded for it, just as with the regular crime stoppers program,
[3:18:57.960 --> 3:19:03.160]  students can remain anonymous, and anything we can do to encourage kids to come forward
[3:19:03.160 --> 3:19:08.360]  and be productive parts of our community is a very, very good thing.
[3:19:08.360 --> 3:19:14.040]  The San Antonio District students can call 227 tips to report a crime, rewards range
[3:19:14.040 --> 3:19:19.720]  from $25 to $250, but they can reach up to a thousand.
[3:19:19.720 --> 3:19:23.960]  By the way, we know about that program for ten years in Austin and all over the country,
[3:19:23.960 --> 3:19:28.520]  they debrief you daily and ask about your parents, boy that's freedom, isn't it Alan?
[3:19:28.520 --> 3:19:32.720]  It is, and the FBI are recruiting ones that have got into trouble, and they let them off
[3:19:32.720 --> 3:19:38.000]  on condition that they tattle, and giving them little perks if they do this for them.
[3:19:38.000 --> 3:19:43.240]  Yeah, it's a total criminal state, total criminal state, stay there Alan Watt, I'm Alex Jones,
[3:19:43.240 --> 3:19:45.840]  we'll be right back.

[3:21:47.240 --> 3:21:52.200]  Hi this is Ted Anderson, have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors
[3:21:52.200 --> 3:21:55.080]  won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[3:21:55.080 --> 3:22:00.240]  That's right, gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986, yet still the
[3:22:00.240 --> 3:22:06.080]  financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[3:22:06.080 --> 3:22:12.280]  The truth be told, gold and silver is outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds and CDs,
[3:22:12.280 --> 3:22:14.240]  yet no word about IRAs.
[3:22:14.240 --> 3:22:18.360]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping
[3:22:18.360 --> 3:22:19.720]  you in paper.
[3:22:19.720 --> 3:22:25.640]  If you'd like to take a look at gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[3:22:25.640 --> 3:22:30.120]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments,
[3:22:30.120 --> 3:22:32.960]  call 800-686-2237.

[3:24:03.080 --> 3:24:05.800]  Alan Watt is our guest, we're going to be taking some of your calls coming up in the
[3:24:05.800 --> 3:24:11.040]  next segment at 1-800-25 at 99231 for Alan, and I'm going to recap in the final segment
[3:24:11.040 --> 3:24:14.680]  a little bit about what's happened at Bilderberg.
[3:24:14.680 --> 3:24:17.800]  Very suspicious with the Texas Governor's Mansion.
[3:24:17.800 --> 3:24:21.920]  What do you see happening in the next few years, Alan, from your studies of the globalists
[3:24:21.920 --> 3:24:24.320]  and some of the things they're doing?
[3:24:24.320 --> 3:24:29.920]  I go on by what they've published themselves and what's in the newspaper today.
[3:24:29.920 --> 3:24:35.880]  We know they're going to give us rationing for everything we need, and that's food, possibly
[3:24:35.880 --> 3:24:38.280]  water and all the rest of it.
[3:24:38.280 --> 3:24:41.640]  They want to get us into a total war mode.
[3:24:41.640 --> 3:24:46.280]  And they're also using the high-tech weaponry that's been spraying the skies across most
[3:24:46.280 --> 3:24:50.240]  of Canada here for the last four days, and it's so hot and humid.
[3:24:50.240 --> 3:24:54.840]  And you see them spraying like crazy, and they're using hard technology along with it.
[3:24:54.840 --> 3:24:58.360]  They must convince the public that we are the problem on the planet.
[3:24:58.360 --> 3:25:00.760]  And now the universities admit there's a spraying program.
[3:25:00.760 --> 3:25:03.720]  I mean, it's just all drugs in the water, everything.
[3:25:03.720 --> 3:25:04.720]  Yes.
[3:25:04.720 --> 3:25:08.360]  And due to our average of watches TV, we'll start because we've got David Suzuki and the
[3:25:08.360 --> 3:25:13.080]  big players working for the World Wildlife Fund and the United Nations telling them repeatedly,
[3:25:13.080 --> 3:25:15.080]  we're the problem.
[3:25:15.080 --> 3:25:18.560]  They're creating these abstract terms like carbon footprints.
[3:25:18.560 --> 3:25:21.840]  They're all breathing out carbon dioxide and killing the planet.
[3:25:21.840 --> 3:25:23.960]  They've got to reduce the population.
[3:25:23.960 --> 3:25:25.040]  And this is the amazing thing.
[3:25:25.040 --> 3:25:31.280]  But they know that with the studied humanity for thousands of years, they know with enough
[3:25:31.280 --> 3:25:38.480]  propaganda to across to the public consistently and repetitively, the public will begin to
[3:25:38.480 --> 3:25:39.960]  accept it.
[3:25:39.960 --> 3:25:43.160]  And this is the victim accepting their own demise.
[3:25:43.160 --> 3:25:48.360]  They also admit that as they reduce the resources artificially, we will then fight with each
[3:25:48.360 --> 3:25:49.360]  other more.
[3:25:49.360 --> 3:25:52.680]  And they're already saying, you don't have resources because there's too many people,
[3:25:52.680 --> 3:25:57.560]  and the general public will accept one child policies, euthanasia and the rest of it.
[3:25:57.560 --> 3:25:58.560]  Exactly.
[3:25:58.560 --> 3:26:01.440]  And now you've got youngsters coming forward that have been brought up with the greening
[3:26:01.440 --> 3:26:06.480]  program who are talking about voluntarily sterilizing themselves.
[3:26:06.480 --> 3:26:09.040]  That's exactly what the victim is meant to do.
[3:26:09.040 --> 3:26:13.600]  He'll believe the propaganda and he will actually ask and go under.
[3:26:13.600 --> 3:26:19.400]  They want to kill off the old type, but that's us, the old type of humanity, the imperfect
[3:26:19.400 --> 3:26:25.720]  type species, and bring in a new perfected slave system to serve them better.
[3:26:25.720 --> 3:26:31.240]  They won't have to use propaganda on, because you won't be able to think as an individual
[3:26:31.240 --> 3:26:32.240]  human being.
[3:26:32.240 --> 3:26:39.840]  It'll be impossible to think individualistically at the Loyola Science Conference they had
[3:26:39.840 --> 3:26:42.640]  kicked off by Newt Gingrich a few years ago.
[3:26:42.640 --> 3:26:46.320]  He talked about giving us the brain chip and he says, when this is done, it says it'll
[3:26:46.320 --> 3:26:50.560]  be no longer possible to think as a distinct, separate individual.
[3:26:50.560 --> 3:26:53.120]  He said, think more like the hive.
[3:26:53.120 --> 3:26:57.720]  You'll hear all this buzzing in your head from the central computer, giving commands
[3:26:57.720 --> 3:27:00.880]  to those around you and to yourself, and then back again.
[3:27:00.880 --> 3:27:01.880]  So you're here.
[3:27:01.880 --> 3:27:05.480]  Well, that's what the Pentagon said in 2000 that the Federation of American Scientists
[3:27:05.480 --> 3:27:06.480]  put out.
[3:27:06.480 --> 3:27:07.480]  It was really from 93.
[3:27:07.480 --> 3:27:13.400]  They said their job by 2025 would be inserting themselves, the last of us, into the hive
[3:27:13.400 --> 3:27:15.880]  chambers, as described in the matrix.
[3:27:15.880 --> 3:27:17.920]  See, they didn't make that up in the matrix.
[3:27:17.920 --> 3:27:18.920]  That's right.
[3:27:18.920 --> 3:27:23.120]  In the movie, it's the grand architect, basically Lucifer, and folks, you can't make this up.
[3:27:23.120 --> 3:27:25.760]  These people are totally insane, but they're doing it.
[3:27:25.760 --> 3:27:26.760]  Alan?
[3:27:26.760 --> 3:27:32.480]  And also, you had the Borg and Star Trek series, where everyone is part cyborg and
[3:27:32.480 --> 3:27:39.320]  chipped, and the Queen Bee controls them all, and their ship was even called the Hive.
[3:27:39.320 --> 3:27:45.360]  So they give you all this subliminal programming to accept what's coming, and you don't consciously
[3:27:45.360 --> 3:27:46.360]  think through it.
[3:27:46.360 --> 3:27:50.200]  I mean, where it really happens, it's kind of familiar to you, so you go along with it.
[3:27:50.200 --> 3:27:52.880]  That's the programming through thinking about that.
[3:27:52.880 --> 3:27:58.520]  Meanwhile, Mr. Shatner, he is, William Shatner's big into all this, and admits that's the
[3:27:58.520 --> 3:27:59.520]  plan.
[3:27:59.520 --> 3:28:02.240]  Yes, he's all for it, himself.
[3:28:02.240 --> 3:28:07.280]  He thinks he's one of the superior ones, and he belongs to the transhumanist society,
[3:28:07.280 --> 3:28:11.880]  and gives talks to them.
[3:28:11.880 --> 3:28:14.480]  It sounds also amazing, but we have an amazing life.
[3:28:14.480 --> 3:28:18.680]  We live on this incredible planet, spinning through the galaxy, there's all these wonders
[3:28:18.680 --> 3:28:19.680]  all around us.
[3:28:19.680 --> 3:28:24.760]  It's 2008, we're living in a science fiction nightmare, but there's also all these great
[3:28:24.760 --> 3:28:26.920]  things around us, and we don't have to go along with it, folks.
[3:28:26.920 --> 3:28:31.800]  I know all this sounds crazy, but it's their own words, it's their own admissions.
[3:28:31.800 --> 3:28:39.480]  You see, since the 1960s onwards, they had done so much to gradually, step by step, dehumanize
[3:28:39.480 --> 3:28:46.920]  society, destroy the family completely, and destroy even conversation between people.
[3:28:46.920 --> 3:28:50.400]  Everyone sits and watches TV, and even those in the room don't communicate unless they're
[3:28:50.400 --> 3:28:54.000]  talking about what they're seeing on television.
[3:28:54.000 --> 3:28:59.080]  What you're fed is degrading stuff, getting more and more degrading, and when you're apathetic
[3:28:59.080 --> 3:29:02.360]  and degraded, you're easily managed.
[3:29:02.360 --> 3:29:07.000]  Even if the language itself has become minimalistic, it's taken so many words from the average
[3:29:07.000 --> 3:29:12.280]  person's vocabulary, it can't convey an idea, and you're the perfect target, then you can't
[3:29:12.280 --> 3:29:16.160]  convey your thoughts to another.
[3:29:16.160 --> 3:29:19.960]  Alan wants my guest, your phone calls, straight ahead.
[3:29:19.960 --> 3:29:22.000]  This is the one, the only.
[3:29:22.000 --> 3:29:27.640]  GCN, radio network, I'm Alex Jones, the top of the spear in the Info War.
[3:29:27.640 --> 3:29:30.240]  We all need your support, we're all in this together.

[3:29:33.240 --> 3:29:36.000]  We'll be right back.
[3:29:36.000 --> 3:29:39.720]  Here on the march, the empire's on the run.
[3:29:39.720 --> 3:29:46.440]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[3:29:46.440 --> 3:29:47.440]  Storeable food.
[3:29:47.440 --> 3:29:48.440]  Storeable food.

[3:30:50.680 --> 3:30:56.920]  the long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut, an entirely new two-hour film that completely
[3:30:56.920 --> 3:30:59.400]  destroys the official fable forever.
[3:30:59.400 --> 3:31:03.600]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation, and which
[3:31:03.600 --> 3:31:06.400]  family members receive answers to their questions.
[3:31:06.400 --> 3:31:10.400]  And the true perpetrators of the horrendous crime are brought to justice.

[3:31:37.120 --> 3:31:40.040]  We're in a no-holds-bar information war.
[3:31:40.040 --> 3:31:44.480]  Truth is our weapon, and prisonplanet.com has the tools you need to take the fight back
[3:31:44.480 --> 3:31:48.680]  to Big Brother.
[3:31:48.680 --> 3:31:53.280]  Once America was led by real politicians, now politicians in the U.S., City, County, State
[3:31:53.280 --> 3:31:56.080]  and Federal are owned and controlled by corporations.
[3:31:56.080 --> 3:31:58.960]  We have corporate representatives instead of politicians.
[3:31:58.960 --> 3:32:02.400]  Internal corporate manipulation has caused grain prices to soar to the highest levels
[3:32:02.400 --> 3:32:03.400]  in history.
[3:32:03.400 --> 3:32:06.360]  Shortages of rice, corn and wheat now exist in most countries.
[3:32:06.360 --> 3:32:09.560]  Natural disasters have put millions worldwide at risk of starvation.
[3:32:09.560 --> 3:32:13.480]  Food riots and bread lines occur daily in 30 nations, and not only is that list growing,
[3:32:13.480 --> 3:32:14.840]  but it's headed this way.
[3:32:14.840 --> 3:32:18.640]  Survival enterprises are massive distributors of the highest quality long-term storage foods.
[3:32:18.640 --> 3:32:22.440]  Mountain House freeze-dried foods, canned beef, chicken turkey, butter, bacon, spices,
[3:32:22.440 --> 3:32:23.560]  cheese, fruit and more.
[3:32:23.560 --> 3:32:25.440]  We have tons of food in stock now.

[3:32:41.840 --> 3:33:07.840]  Call now.
[3:33:21.280 --> 3:33:24.760]  The New World Order stages September 11 attacks.
[3:33:24.760 --> 3:33:28.840]  The first World Trade Center attacks in 93 as well, the Oklahoma City bombing, and there's
[3:33:28.840 --> 3:33:34.160]  countless others like Gulf of Tonkin, USS Liberty, Operation Gladio, where they admit
[3:33:34.160 --> 3:33:35.160]  what they've done.
[3:33:35.160 --> 3:33:38.840]  Hitler brought in his tyranny by burning down his own capital building.
[3:33:38.840 --> 3:33:42.840]  I believe they've done something similar here in Austin, Texas, just a heads up to
[3:33:42.840 --> 3:33:43.840]  everybody.
[3:33:43.840 --> 3:33:49.000]  I'm going down there, 15, 20 minutes after the show ends, so about 3.30 central, moved
[3:33:49.000 --> 3:33:52.160]  down to Governor's Man's and trying to survey things.
[3:33:52.160 --> 3:33:55.480]  They try to tell me I can't have cameras and be getting video of it, but I bet they're
[3:33:55.480 --> 3:34:01.840]  already trying to cover it up, so we can't see evidence of what they've done, 95% chance
[3:34:01.840 --> 3:34:02.840]  they've done it.
[3:34:02.840 --> 3:34:08.080]  I mean, out of that 95% chance, I would say an 80% chance out of that, that it was arson
[3:34:08.080 --> 3:34:11.760]  by the government, by a criminal element.
[3:34:11.760 --> 3:34:16.200]  Maybe there's a 15% chance that it was something in the construction that caused it, and they're
[3:34:16.200 --> 3:34:20.760]  just hyping and saying it's terrorism, saying it's arson.
[3:34:20.760 --> 3:34:24.120]  But the DPS had come out saying that they were going to switch over to mainly quote
[3:34:24.120 --> 3:34:27.800]  fighting terror, the imaginary boogeyman, that is suppressing the public.
[3:34:27.800 --> 3:34:30.920]  When you hear that, that means the terrorist running your life, turning the state police
[3:34:30.920 --> 3:34:33.120]  into total thug goons as they've already been converting.
[3:34:33.120 --> 3:34:36.880]  They used to be a lot nicer, now they're really getting bad.
[3:34:36.880 --> 3:34:38.160]  It's really a shame to see this happen.
[3:34:38.160 --> 3:34:41.200]  The government's training your kids to be tattletales on you, they're sucking blood
[3:34:41.200 --> 3:34:43.040]  from you at checkpoints.
[3:34:43.040 --> 3:34:46.680]  You see, they're not going to stop, folks, they're not going to stop with 9-11.
[3:34:46.680 --> 3:34:47.840]  They're going to keep going.
[3:34:47.840 --> 3:34:48.840]  They're not done.
[3:34:48.840 --> 3:34:49.840]  They're not going to give up.
[3:34:49.840 --> 3:34:50.840]  They're not going to give in.
[3:34:50.840 --> 3:34:55.280]  This is life and death, and I realize that, I mean, I am totally into this fight.
[3:34:55.280 --> 3:34:56.680]  We don't have a choice.
[3:34:56.680 --> 3:34:57.680]  None of us have a choice.
[3:34:57.680 --> 3:35:02.160]  We can't just sit here and let them carry out eugenics and rationing and microchipping
[3:35:02.160 --> 3:35:03.840]  against us.
[3:35:03.840 --> 3:35:07.080]  Alan, how do you see them?
[3:35:07.080 --> 3:35:11.120]  We're going to go to calls from Australia, to the Colorado, California, North Carolina.
[3:35:11.120 --> 3:35:14.920]  But how do you see them trying to get the public ready for the chips?
[3:35:14.920 --> 3:35:17.760]  I mean, I know they've made the military do it now, most of them.
[3:35:17.760 --> 3:35:18.760]  That's now admitted.
[3:35:18.760 --> 3:35:20.360]  The unbelievable has now happened.
[3:35:20.360 --> 3:35:22.920]  I guess to have a job, you're going to have to have one or be a trusted traveler.
[3:35:22.920 --> 3:35:23.920]  You're going to have to have one.
[3:35:23.920 --> 3:35:24.920]  That's what Bilderberg was saying.
[3:35:24.920 --> 3:35:27.440]  You know, you're going to get special perks if you take it.
[3:35:27.440 --> 3:35:30.720]  I mean, I guess I'm answering my own question, but anything else you want to add?
[3:35:30.720 --> 3:35:36.840]  Yes, to also hype it up, there was also an article put out a little while back there
[3:35:36.840 --> 3:35:43.280]  from the major drug companies to do with the chips will save us all in times of pandemic.
[3:35:43.280 --> 3:35:48.480]  And because you were able to scan you and that chip will tell them if you have a fever
[3:35:48.480 --> 3:35:51.160]  and possibly are carrying a plague.
[3:35:51.160 --> 3:35:55.160]  So they've got a whole bunch of scenarios they can use to make us take this thing or
[3:35:55.160 --> 3:35:56.440]  try and convince the public.
[3:35:56.440 --> 3:36:01.280]  And as you say, you'll get little perks if you go along with them and no doubt, too,
[3:36:01.280 --> 3:36:02.800]  you'll be shunned by society.
[3:36:02.800 --> 3:36:07.560]  If you don't go along with them, we find the drug companies are already putting ads
[3:36:07.560 --> 3:36:10.680]  out there to get, for instance, the flu shot.
[3:36:10.680 --> 3:36:15.680]  And if you don't take your flu shot, the ad stops and it says, you could put the rest
[3:36:15.680 --> 3:36:17.400]  of the community at risk.
[3:36:17.400 --> 3:36:23.240]  This is the creation of what they call social acceptance and non-acceptance.
[3:36:23.240 --> 3:36:28.320]  They copied the system from China to do with abortion, where to get society to turn against
[3:36:28.320 --> 3:36:31.640]  you because you're the odd one out, you're a threat to them.
[3:36:31.640 --> 3:36:33.000]  And so they're using the same technique.
[3:36:33.000 --> 3:36:34.000]  Your pressure.
[3:36:34.000 --> 3:36:35.000]  Yes.
[3:36:35.000 --> 3:36:36.800]  And let me just add a point here.
[3:36:36.800 --> 3:36:42.240]  We've got a story up on infowars.com named Bilderberg Gunn with a gun.
[3:36:42.240 --> 3:36:45.560]  And people are saying, why is it a still shot from a YouTube video?
[3:36:45.560 --> 3:36:47.040]  Why don't you show the actual video?
[3:36:47.040 --> 3:36:49.000]  Well, let me explain something.
[3:36:49.000 --> 3:36:53.160]  We've got about 60 hours of footage that four of us shot while we were there.
[3:36:53.160 --> 3:36:55.320]  There were hundreds of other people there.
[3:36:55.320 --> 3:36:57.200]  I got in at 12.30 last night.
[3:36:57.200 --> 3:37:00.320]  My plane was delayed for an hour and a half.
[3:37:00.320 --> 3:37:01.480]  This is not our footage.
[3:37:01.480 --> 3:37:02.680]  We got the same footage.
[3:37:02.680 --> 3:37:04.620]  I saw them with the guns.
[3:37:04.620 --> 3:37:07.840]  We haven't even had time to dump our footage to computer or put it up.
[3:37:07.840 --> 3:37:12.360]  This is other people that were there putting up YouTube videos of what I saw and reported
[3:37:12.360 --> 3:37:16.800]  to you days ago, them flashing the MP5s at us.
[3:37:16.800 --> 3:37:19.760]  So they're in the comments section saying, it's blurred.
[3:37:19.760 --> 3:37:20.960]  You can't tell it's a gun.
[3:37:20.960 --> 3:37:21.960]  It's not a gun.
[3:37:21.960 --> 3:37:22.960]  It's a seat belt.
[3:37:22.960 --> 3:37:23.960]  No.
[3:37:23.960 --> 3:37:24.960]  They had guns.
[3:37:24.960 --> 3:37:25.960]  They had them out.
[3:37:25.960 --> 3:37:27.160]  They were aiming them at us.
[3:37:27.160 --> 3:37:28.840]  We have clear video of it.
[3:37:28.840 --> 3:37:30.040]  We're not a million people.
[3:37:30.040 --> 3:37:31.320]  We actually have to do this work.
[3:37:31.320 --> 3:37:35.040]  Like, I'm going to have to get in the car and drive down there to investigate the governor's
[3:37:35.040 --> 3:37:39.080]  mansion, even though I haven't seen my children, because I just got home last night, saw him
[3:37:39.080 --> 3:37:41.160]  briefly this morning in five, six days.
[3:37:41.160 --> 3:37:42.160]  I'm not whining.
[3:37:42.160 --> 3:37:43.800]  It's just, I'm not Superman.
[3:37:43.800 --> 3:37:45.560]  I'm not Superman.
[3:37:45.560 --> 3:37:50.240]  And we, this morning, I saw that somebody put up the video of the guns I saw.
[3:37:50.240 --> 3:37:52.000]  So I told Kurt, I said, get a screenshot of this.
[3:37:52.000 --> 3:37:53.560]  You did the best job they did.
[3:37:53.560 --> 3:37:57.120]  If you don't like the fact that it's not that clear, you need to have been out there and
[3:37:57.120 --> 3:37:58.120]  get video of it.
[3:37:58.120 --> 3:38:00.640]  It's just, it's just, and I'm not complaining.
[3:38:00.640 --> 3:38:05.280]  It's that they've trained the public, even our own people, to never do anything themselves,
[3:38:05.280 --> 3:38:08.120]  but then nitpick and demand everything else out of us, Alan.
[3:38:08.120 --> 3:38:09.120]  Yes.
[3:38:09.120 --> 3:38:10.120]  They have.
[3:38:10.120 --> 3:38:11.280]  And again, people live on fiction.
[3:38:11.280 --> 3:38:18.560]  A generation has been reared, watching cops smash doors down and so on in movies and in
[3:38:18.560 --> 3:38:24.440]  dramas and real life things until, and those youngsters, youngsters want to be on the winning
[3:38:24.440 --> 3:38:25.440]  team.
[3:38:25.440 --> 3:38:30.120]  This is an instinctive, survival thing with all youngsters and the heroes to them through
[3:38:30.120 --> 3:38:35.960]  the video game, from the military organizations, that's where the videos all came from, to,
[3:38:35.960 --> 3:38:40.440]  to all the programs they watch with their superheroes, the guy's dressed in black.
[3:38:40.440 --> 3:38:41.440]  That's what they want to be.
[3:38:41.440 --> 3:38:46.800]  Well, now we have a generation who are in the police and in the military with the toys
[3:38:46.800 --> 3:38:50.600]  and the guns, and they think nothing about turning that gun on you.
[3:38:50.600 --> 3:38:54.200]  They think nothing about it, they've been conditioned that you're not a human being,
[3:38:54.200 --> 3:38:59.040]  you're just a target like the video games, and, and believe you me, they will do what
[3:38:59.040 --> 3:39:00.040]  they're told.
[3:39:00.040 --> 3:39:01.040]  That's the unfortunate thing.
[3:39:01.040 --> 3:39:02.040]  They're like robots already.
[3:39:02.040 --> 3:39:03.040]  Yeah.
[3:39:03.040 --> 3:39:09.560]  And another issue is we have info wars posting open to everybody, it's a First Amendment forum
[3:39:09.560 --> 3:39:13.200]  that allows our enemies and detractors to come in and say, I'm an agent, you're an agent,
[3:39:13.200 --> 3:39:14.200]  everybody else is an agent.
[3:39:14.200 --> 3:39:15.520]  No, that's what agents do.
[3:39:15.520 --> 3:39:19.440]  They go around telling you that, telling you all these things.
[3:39:19.440 --> 3:39:23.680]  They're in there, and before we've tracked the ISPs, it's government most of the time
[3:39:23.680 --> 3:39:26.520]  saying, let's get the government, let's kill them, let's do that.
[3:39:26.520 --> 3:39:30.800]  We're not saying that, and again, we have the feds in there trying to destroy free speech
[3:39:30.800 --> 3:39:35.000]  by, by posting these type of things.
[3:39:35.000 --> 3:39:39.080]  And again, I had fed after fed come up to me and say, come on, Alex, you know we need
[3:39:39.080 --> 3:39:40.080]  to get violent.
[3:39:40.080 --> 3:39:42.080]  And I just look at them and go, man, knock it off.
[3:39:42.080 --> 3:39:44.080]  You're such a traitor to this country.
[3:39:44.080 --> 3:39:47.440]  I mean, how do they get these, these feds to be so criminal?
[3:39:47.440 --> 3:39:53.800]  It's not so hard, but yet we have, again, to do with the psychopathic type people at
[3:39:53.800 --> 3:40:01.200]  the top, they give you a psychopathic culture which we live in and we emulate and success
[3:40:01.200 --> 3:40:04.000]  is getting to the top by any means possible.
[3:40:04.000 --> 3:40:07.480]  We worship, look at the television, they worship the stars.
[3:40:07.480 --> 3:40:11.400]  They worship people who are multi-millionaires, the rich and the famous.
[3:40:11.400 --> 3:40:13.400]  And this is what you've been taught to worship.
[3:40:13.400 --> 3:40:16.720]  It doesn't matter how they got up there, how many they destroyed to get up there as long
[3:40:16.720 --> 3:40:19.600]  as they got there, this is what we're given.
[3:40:19.600 --> 3:40:25.840]  So we have a psychopathic culture and these characters who get well paid, Lenin said this,
[3:40:25.840 --> 3:40:29.680]  he says, first we must pay the police well and the military, then the teachers because
[3:40:29.680 --> 3:40:33.920]  they all have to do with social control, long term social control.
[3:40:33.920 --> 3:40:35.960]  And this has never been stopped.
[3:40:35.960 --> 3:40:37.520]  Let me give an example of that.
[3:40:37.520 --> 3:40:38.960]  Let me give an example of that.
[3:40:38.960 --> 3:40:43.360]  They admit they fly in tens of billions of dollars, it's over 60 billion they admit
[3:40:43.360 --> 3:40:50.840]  to on huge pallets and they just give $30,000 to privates, 50, 60, 70, 80,000, 100,000 to
[3:40:50.840 --> 3:40:56.520]  the different grades of officers above that, up to colonel, millions to colonels.
[3:40:56.520 --> 3:41:00.080]  And these goons were there and I said, they pay you guys off when you're in Iraq and they
[3:41:00.080 --> 3:41:02.000]  just started going, yeah, we do, so what?
[3:41:02.000 --> 3:41:05.240]  Yeah, when I was there, I was, they were just, you know.
[3:41:05.240 --> 3:41:08.840]  It's total criminality, they've been trained to be involved in criminal activities, they've
[3:41:08.840 --> 3:41:09.840]  been compromised.
[3:41:09.840 --> 3:41:16.240]  Yeah, they're bought off and technically they have a mercenary attitude, they've done programs
[3:41:16.240 --> 3:41:22.120]  and BBC on this very thing, years ago on the psychopathic types that are recruited, especially
[3:41:22.120 --> 3:41:28.880]  by the U.S. and military, for top positions in special forces and they give them tests
[3:41:28.880 --> 3:41:32.920]  to see if the psychopathic tendencies, because they said they can count on them to do whatever
[3:41:32.920 --> 3:41:37.320]  they're told and they will simply obey the man who pays them.
[3:41:37.320 --> 3:41:39.440]  And this is the psychopath we're dealing with right here.
[3:41:39.440 --> 3:41:41.640]  They have no moral clams whatsoever.
[3:41:41.640 --> 3:41:45.280]  They also belong, this is a part of the mind control from the military that they use in
[3:41:45.280 --> 3:41:47.000]  the police now as well.
[3:41:47.000 --> 3:41:51.160]  You're a separate species, you belong to a brother who does the fraternity of police
[3:41:51.160 --> 3:41:56.320]  and your enemy are those people out there, all those people walking the streets, they're
[3:41:56.320 --> 3:41:57.800]  now your enemy.
[3:41:57.800 --> 3:42:02.880]  And they start to, you know, they start to believe it.
[3:42:02.880 --> 3:42:06.520]  But it's a very well proven technique of mind control.
[3:42:06.520 --> 3:42:08.840]  That's a gang mentality and us against them.
[3:42:08.840 --> 3:42:09.840]  They segregate them.
[3:42:09.840 --> 3:42:14.520]  Well, when they would drive in and out with big SUVs with sirens on the top, they would
[3:42:14.520 --> 3:42:19.840]  have the windows down, sometimes the doors cracked and they would lift up and show you
[3:42:19.840 --> 3:42:25.640]  the MP5s and look at you with pure hatred, like it was scaring us.
[3:42:25.640 --> 3:42:30.560]  And I just saw little punks, but the point is there they are menacing peaceful protesters
[3:42:30.560 --> 3:42:33.840]  with guns.
[3:42:33.840 --> 3:42:34.840]  It's just unbelievable.
[3:42:34.840 --> 3:42:38.080]  Yeah, it's unbelievable, but that's what we have.
[3:42:38.080 --> 3:42:43.600]  They've been bred for this job, about 30 years of a debasing culture gradually dropping
[3:42:43.600 --> 3:42:45.480]  to the bottom.
[3:42:45.480 --> 3:42:49.400]  Any old system of religion has been almost totally destroyed.
[3:42:49.400 --> 3:42:52.120]  There's no moral clams and they will please their boss.
[3:42:52.120 --> 3:42:56.200]  They want to be on the winning team and they've lived their whole lives to wear those black
[3:42:56.200 --> 3:42:58.920]  outfits and carry those guns.
[3:42:58.920 --> 3:43:00.920]  Let's take some calls.
[3:43:00.920 --> 3:43:03.840]  I'm going to go to Al in Australia who's been holding the longest.
[3:43:03.840 --> 3:43:04.840]  Thanks for holding Al.
[3:43:04.840 --> 3:43:05.840]  You're on the air.
[3:43:05.840 --> 3:43:08.840]  Lucky my surname's not Kyder.
[3:43:08.840 --> 3:43:09.840]  Absolutely.
[3:43:09.840 --> 3:43:11.840]  You're on the air, sir.
[3:43:11.840 --> 3:43:12.840]  Yeah.
[3:43:12.840 --> 3:43:16.840]  I've been listening to every show of yours for the last three years.
[3:43:16.840 --> 3:43:22.160]  Alex, this is the most powerful one I've ever heard and the creme de la creme in Gesson,
[3:43:22.160 --> 3:43:23.160]  Allen.
[3:43:23.160 --> 3:43:28.800]  A quick thing were to tell you I did a huge backdrop banner for you or a promotional
[3:43:28.800 --> 3:43:33.000]  banner, whatever you want to use it for, but Cosmos has it.
[3:43:33.000 --> 3:43:37.040]  He took it back from the 9-Eleven Truth Conference that was in Sydney here.
[3:43:37.040 --> 3:43:39.480]  I did the art for that.
[3:43:39.480 --> 3:43:46.720]  And the quick point I wanted to make is that I think the actual global genocide is well
[3:43:46.720 --> 3:43:47.720]  underway.
[3:43:47.720 --> 3:43:56.240]  I rang Lee Rogers about this the other day and I just wanted to get your take on it.
[3:43:56.240 --> 3:43:59.920]  I think that we're just like when we screw away from the cashless society.
[3:43:59.920 --> 3:44:04.000]  Well, I mean, look, we've already got women with a seven-fold in one decade.
[3:44:04.000 --> 3:44:06.160]  This came out in 2006.
[3:44:06.160 --> 3:44:11.600]  In 10 years from 96 to 2006, a seven-fold increase in women.
[3:44:11.600 --> 3:44:17.720]  I mean, 20, 30-year-old women getting lung cancer who don't even smoke.
[3:44:17.720 --> 3:44:21.840]  We've got from one in 33 having cancer to one in three.
[3:44:21.840 --> 3:44:23.680]  All these other diseases are off the charts.
[3:44:23.680 --> 3:44:27.320]  We know they're poisoning the air, water, and food, and all these poor cops and goons
[3:44:27.320 --> 3:44:30.520]  and they have no idea they're being killed, Alan.
[3:44:30.520 --> 3:44:31.520]  Absolutely.
[3:44:31.520 --> 3:44:37.480]  This is, I've got the tape, I've got the tape from Dr. Salk that was aired on the CBC
[3:44:37.480 --> 3:44:43.920]  television here a few years ago where he admitted, this was a live interview, he admitted that
[3:44:43.920 --> 3:44:49.080]  he knew that all these cancer viruses were contained in his polio vaccine, he also talked
[3:44:49.080 --> 3:44:50.080]  to his staff.
[3:44:50.080 --> 3:44:55.200]  And he did say that the only purpose these particular viruses had was to cause cancer.
[3:44:55.200 --> 3:45:00.080]  Now Salk himself was one of the top members of the eugenics society who prior to that,
[3:45:00.080 --> 3:45:04.040]  prior to the polio vaccine, he was working on ways of depopulation.
[3:45:04.040 --> 3:45:07.600]  He was a prime advocate for depop, massive depopulation.
[3:45:07.600 --> 3:45:13.000]  And there's massive evidence that they engineered the polio vaccine to then give people a quote
[3:45:13.000 --> 3:45:15.800]  cure to train everybody to take vaccines.
[3:45:15.800 --> 3:45:16.800]  Yes.
[3:45:16.800 --> 3:45:24.160]  The polio vaccine, we had the burst out of tremendous drop in health standard, health,
[3:45:24.160 --> 3:45:28.600]  people getting sick with junior arthritis, adolescent arthritis, never happened before
[3:45:28.600 --> 3:45:31.320]  their immune systems were, but half of what they should be.
[3:45:31.320 --> 3:45:36.400]  Now hundreds of thousands are getting Alzheimer's when they're 25, 30 years old.
[3:45:36.400 --> 3:45:40.080]  And I want to be clear, we've played that CBC report where he laughs and says, yeah,
[3:45:40.080 --> 3:45:44.920]  the monkeys had thousands of different viruses, ha, ha, ha, and they all laugh and he talks
[3:45:44.920 --> 3:45:51.320]  about AIDS and about how the monkeys they used for different vaccine manufacturing had
[3:45:51.320 --> 3:45:55.320]  all these viruses from a bioweapon lab that they had in Africa.
[3:45:55.320 --> 3:46:07.920]  I see a synchronistic date sort of for the 30th of December next year when the KDEX elementaries
[3:46:07.920 --> 3:46:09.840]  sort of comes into place.
[3:46:09.840 --> 3:46:15.800]  And that's what Ellen was talking about before, the chemtrails and the wealth famine that
[3:46:15.800 --> 3:46:21.440]  they're just bombarding us with and the CO2 tax, I reckon that's the actual date that
[3:46:21.440 --> 3:46:27.960]  the global government is in place, you know, and that's what the Liver was actually about.
[3:46:27.960 --> 3:46:32.200]  Well it certainly is and I appreciate your call, Al, from Australia.
[3:46:32.200 --> 3:46:36.280]  Look, I'm not saying I'm a hero, I'm not saying I've even got courage.
[3:46:36.280 --> 3:46:39.200]  I learned of criminals doing bad things 15 years ago.
[3:46:39.200 --> 3:46:41.320]  I got on air 13 years ago.
[3:46:41.320 --> 3:46:43.480]  I go to the Bilderberg and try to warn the people.
[3:46:43.480 --> 3:46:47.120]  These are the folks setting up the North American Union, their own documents, the European Union,
[3:46:47.120 --> 3:46:48.960]  they're the ones that want to destroy the dollar.
[3:46:48.960 --> 3:46:50.720]  They're the ones that want to jack up oil prices.
[3:46:50.720 --> 3:46:53.480]  They're the ones that launched the wars against Serbia and Iraq.
[3:46:53.480 --> 3:46:55.000]  They're the ones that want to go into Iran.
[3:46:55.000 --> 3:46:56.680]  They're the ones hurting us.
[3:46:56.680 --> 3:46:58.880]  And I know for a fact they're poisoning you, police.
[3:46:58.880 --> 3:47:02.320]  I know for a fact they're staging almost all the terror.
[3:47:02.320 --> 3:47:05.360]  I know for the fact they're the bad guys, Ellen knows.
[3:47:05.360 --> 3:47:11.120]  I didn't go there enjoying bullhorning them or enjoying putting myself in their way and
[3:47:11.120 --> 3:47:16.240]  then having their phone calls to my family about gang raping and before that about how
[3:47:16.240 --> 3:47:20.240]  I got into some girl pregnant making it up to freak my wife out which didn't work.
[3:47:20.240 --> 3:47:22.880]  I'm upset that they did it but she knew it was bull.
[3:47:22.880 --> 3:47:26.440]  I mean it just reaffirms that we're living in one dangerous time.
[3:47:26.440 --> 3:47:30.720]  These are very evil people who the elite said hundreds of years ago, we want a scientific
[3:47:30.720 --> 3:47:33.000]  way to control people and maintain our power.
[3:47:33.000 --> 3:47:37.200]  They've made all the modern scientific developments about controlling us, they're compartmentalized
[3:47:37.200 --> 3:47:43.240]  and it's just so sad that this is happening but God help us, I mean they're killing you
[3:47:43.240 --> 3:47:44.240]  out there folks.
[3:47:44.240 --> 3:47:48.040]  You can't just stay quiet and not fight them and Ellen, what are ways for people to fight
[3:47:48.040 --> 3:47:51.960]  back against the new world order in your opinion?
[3:47:51.960 --> 3:47:58.440]  It's a matter of first of educating yourself and to number one, you've got to understand
[3:47:58.440 --> 3:48:02.000]  that this is their system already for the last 50 years that was their system.
[3:48:02.000 --> 3:48:06.520]  They gave us that system of factories and employment and so on.
[3:48:06.520 --> 3:48:11.160]  They're simply, from their point of view at the top, they're upgrading their system.
[3:48:11.160 --> 3:48:15.960]  They owned it then, it gives a little bit more freedom and scope and a little bit more
[3:48:15.960 --> 3:48:16.960]  luxury to afford.
[3:48:16.960 --> 3:48:22.520]  And they admitted Paul's reports, that was to get us lackadaisical, to get us fat and
[3:48:22.520 --> 3:48:24.640]  happy, to get us to trust them.
[3:48:24.640 --> 3:48:31.400]  Yeah, you must create a socialized society where the people gradually accept without
[3:48:31.400 --> 3:48:36.280]  reasoning it through but it's a gradual process of acceptance that there are experts ruling
[3:48:36.280 --> 3:48:39.440]  over you and taking care of all the big problems.
[3:48:39.440 --> 3:48:44.120]  So you're being taught to be like a child forever and allow your betters to take care
[3:48:44.120 --> 3:48:45.320]  of the big problems.
[3:48:45.320 --> 3:48:48.400]  They're destroying your independence, that's what it is.
[3:48:48.400 --> 3:48:51.800]  That's it, it's making you totally dependent on them so they can carry out the eugenics,
[3:48:51.800 --> 3:48:55.640]  the soft kill and orderly exterminate you through the system.
[3:48:55.640 --> 3:48:58.240]  Dave and Colorado, you're on the air, go ahead.
[3:48:58.240 --> 3:49:02.080]  Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[3:49:02.080 --> 3:49:03.080]  Can you hear me?
[3:49:03.080 --> 3:49:04.080]  Yes, I can.
[3:49:04.080 --> 3:49:05.080]  Okay, thanks.
[3:49:05.080 --> 3:49:11.840]  I just have to admit that when you asked everyone to say a prayer earlier today, despite myself
[3:49:11.840 --> 3:49:17.280]  I found myself saying that prayer and I felt inspired to go ahead and get on the line although
[3:49:17.280 --> 3:49:20.000]  I knew I wouldn't be talking to you and here I am.
[3:49:20.000 --> 3:49:26.960]  So miracles do happen, I'm a professional cultural anthropologist specializing in the
[3:49:26.960 --> 3:49:34.400]  Andean region and I've worked for the Smithsonian and have taught in the University of Maryland
[3:49:34.400 --> 3:49:40.160]  system where I taught 9-Eleven Truth by the way and showed Terror Storm.
[3:49:40.160 --> 3:49:50.040]  And I'm currently co-authoring a book with Peter Dale Scott that starts around the turn
[3:49:50.040 --> 3:49:57.240]  of the 20th century and the eugenics movement and going into the 1930s fascist coup attempt
[3:49:57.240 --> 3:50:04.800]  and then obviously World War II and then post-World War II Operation Sunshine, Gladio
[3:50:04.800 --> 3:50:08.960]  and Condor and then tying that all in.
[3:50:08.960 --> 3:50:09.960]  What's your name?
[3:50:09.960 --> 3:50:10.960]  I'd like to get you on as a guest.
[3:50:10.960 --> 3:50:12.680]  We've had Peter Dale Scott on quite a bit over the years.
[3:50:12.680 --> 3:50:14.320]  Sure, I'd love it.
[3:50:14.320 --> 3:50:16.680]  Would you mind if I told you that after we get off the air?
[3:50:16.680 --> 3:50:19.600]  Yeah, I'm going to let you come back and finish up real quick on the other side with Alan
[3:50:19.600 --> 3:50:24.240]  Waukes as the final segment and then I'll try to cram Cory and Bill in.
[3:50:24.240 --> 3:50:27.440]  I just want to say that the elite want to control history.
[3:50:27.440 --> 3:50:28.760]  They want to control the future.
[3:50:28.760 --> 3:50:32.240]  They want to wall us off and orderly get rid of us so they can inherit the future.
[3:50:32.240 --> 3:50:37.560]  The ultimate form of selfishness, the ultimate form of abuse, the ultimate form of greediness
[3:50:37.560 --> 3:50:41.720]  and small-mindedness and I'm just begging everybody in the system to fight back against
[3:50:41.720 --> 3:50:44.240]  it and spread the word and we can beat these people.
[3:50:44.240 --> 3:50:49.040]  We've got to do it.
[3:50:49.040 --> 3:50:52.120]  I'm walking down the street and hearing footsteps behind you.

[3:54:30.320 --> 3:54:34.760]  wanted to make uh... today i just uh... just wrapping up in the completion of the
[3:54:34.760 --> 3:54:37.320]  talking about the what we're writing about it
[3:54:37.320 --> 3:54:41.520]  tying all of those uh... antecedents to towards uh...
[3:54:41.520 --> 3:54:46.680]  nine eleven and the development of these private mercenary armies blackwater and
[3:54:46.680 --> 3:54:50.880]  the entire private security apparatus that all over
[3:54:50.880 --> 3:54:54.120]  north and all those people are setting up
[3:54:54.120 --> 3:54:56.720]  what i wanted to say today
[3:54:56.720 --> 3:54:59.480]  having very short amount of time is that
[3:54:59.480 --> 3:55:04.360]  really what we're looking at is just a reoccurrence of the same type of system
[3:55:04.360 --> 3:55:07.640]  just with better technology that we've seen in gladio
[3:55:07.640 --> 3:55:09.960]  and condor and i do wanna
[3:55:09.960 --> 3:55:13.720]  uh... hype a book it's not mine but the best book i've ever read
[3:55:13.720 --> 3:55:16.040]  in terms of operation condor
[3:55:16.040 --> 3:55:19.120]  one of the most frightening book she'll ever read
[3:55:19.120 --> 3:55:21.760]  is titled predatory state
[3:55:21.760 --> 3:55:24.920]  operation condor and covert war in latin america
[3:55:24.920 --> 3:55:29.160]  by jay patrice mcshary that i've read it that's what i was about to say is they're
[3:55:29.160 --> 3:55:32.320]  setting up death squads that's exactly right and
[3:55:32.320 --> 3:55:34.480]  and the part that uh...
[3:55:34.480 --> 3:55:36.720]  peter and i are focusing on is
[3:55:36.720 --> 3:55:38.000]  the re current
[3:55:38.000 --> 3:55:40.840]  thread of not the uh...
[3:55:40.840 --> 3:55:45.400]  in its most virulent form in all of these uh... in all of these settings it was as
[3:55:45.400 --> 3:55:47.680]  you know that you've read the book
[3:55:47.680 --> 3:55:48.880]  that uh...
[3:55:48.880 --> 3:55:51.520]  the it was not sees as that
[3:55:51.520 --> 3:55:53.720]  stormtroopers who were training
[3:55:53.720 --> 3:55:59.120]  uh... the uh... they've used not season nasa in in the bio weapons in every
[3:55:59.120 --> 3:56:01.480]  form because they were the perfect catalyst
[3:56:01.480 --> 3:56:04.360]  like an enzyme to gel and create whole groups
[3:56:04.360 --> 3:56:06.880]  listen i'm gonna get your info like to have you on them to get it right now
[3:56:06.880 --> 3:56:08.280]  okay thanks a lot
[3:56:08.280 --> 3:56:09.080]  make it a
[3:56:09.080 --> 3:56:12.040]  allen i'm gonna have time to take other calls i apologize to corian bell and
[3:56:12.040 --> 3:56:13.360]  others they call back tomorrow
[3:56:13.360 --> 3:56:17.000]  head of the line but in closing off what he just said
[3:56:17.000 --> 3:56:18.840]  well people have to realize
[3:56:18.840 --> 3:56:21.480]  number one part of the fighting for
[3:56:21.480 --> 3:56:25.080]  and isn't going to get to that stage and stop what you can't fight to save the
[3:56:25.080 --> 3:56:27.720]  system that's not used in the first place
[3:56:27.720 --> 3:56:30.960]  it's owned by the crooks at the top right now
[3:56:30.960 --> 3:56:34.160]  most you are trying to save what they already have and hope it doesn't get any
[3:56:34.160 --> 3:56:35.440]  worse
[3:56:35.440 --> 3:56:39.200]  but what you're really fighting for is is is that inner
[3:56:39.200 --> 3:56:42.200]  self of the highest things in humanity
[3:56:42.200 --> 3:56:44.800]  is the highest things that the bond is together
[3:56:44.800 --> 3:56:46.120]  it brought us through
[3:56:46.120 --> 3:56:48.360]  thousands of millions of years together
[3:56:48.360 --> 3:56:52.920]  as the cooperation is the decency we're going to bring back decency within people
[3:56:52.920 --> 3:56:54.960]  and and show that because
[3:56:54.960 --> 3:56:57.720]  uh... that's the only way we're going to combat
[3:56:57.720 --> 3:56:58.920]  at the system
[3:56:58.920 --> 3:57:03.120]  it's when we interact and help each other out isn't as real human beings
[3:57:03.120 --> 3:57:05.200]  thought that they've been selfish
[3:57:05.200 --> 3:57:07.960]  uh... and and it's agreeable
[3:57:07.960 --> 3:57:09.720]  because that's really the only
[3:57:09.720 --> 3:57:13.600]  chance we have collectively of of altering this and coming through but
[3:57:13.600 --> 3:57:17.160]  it will be a different system we come into we can't go back to the same system
[3:57:17.160 --> 3:57:18.840]  with the same crooks running it
