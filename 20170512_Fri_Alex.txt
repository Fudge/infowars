[00:00.000 --> 00:13.660]  You thought the lead in winter would bring you down forever, but you rode upon a steamer
[00:13.660 --> 00:16.640]  to the violence of the sun.
[00:16.640 --> 00:23.960]  Broadcasting live from the UN Stronghold, Austin, Texas, you're listening to the Alex Jones
[00:23.960 --> 00:24.960]  show.
[00:24.960 --> 00:32.720]  I'm going to admit something to you on air right now.
[00:32.720 --> 00:41.560]  I overprepare, I laid in bed last night for about three hours with an iPad reading news
[00:41.560 --> 00:46.480]  and watching video clips, then I got up at about 6am this morning in research for a couple
[00:46.480 --> 00:53.000]  hours and then I got back to work and went over the latest news and my head is just spinning.
[00:53.000 --> 00:56.200]  Matt, one of the producers walked in and he goes, this is going to be an incredible show
[00:56.200 --> 00:57.200]  today.
[00:57.200 --> 00:58.200]  Look at all these clips.
[00:58.200 --> 00:59.200]  You sent us the other clips we have.
[00:59.200 --> 01:00.920]  It's incredible.
[01:00.920 --> 01:03.920]  Total constitutional crisis meltdown on the government.
[01:03.920 --> 01:04.920]  This is amazing.
[01:04.920 --> 01:07.960]  And I'm just like, yeah, I know it's amazing, isn't it?
[01:07.960 --> 01:14.240]  It's amazing how good Trump is, a commission to expose election fraud, and how the Democrats
[01:14.240 --> 01:18.880]  are openly getting illegals to vote in mass, Pence coming out and admitting that there's
[01:18.880 --> 01:23.000]  genocide against Christians, hundreds of thousands a year being killed.
[01:23.000 --> 01:26.640]  Nobody would say that just a year ago.
[01:26.640 --> 01:34.720]  U.S. steel coming roaring back, U.S. aluminum, U.S. dry goods, U.S. finished goods, so many
[01:34.720 --> 01:35.720]  good numbers.
[01:35.720 --> 01:39.920]  But then you juxtapose it with all the bad numbers and we are in the best of times, worst
[01:39.920 --> 01:40.920]  of times.
[01:40.920 --> 01:46.360]  I opened the broadcast so many times with that statement and then stuff like this.
[01:46.360 --> 01:51.840]  I watched this seven and a half minute GQ rant by Keith Oberman and I watched it very,
[01:51.840 --> 01:52.840]  very carefully.
[01:52.840 --> 01:55.000]  Let me tell you something.
[01:55.000 --> 01:57.280]  Oberman didn't do this as a stunt.
[01:57.280 --> 02:03.720]  I know body language and I watched it twice last night and this morning.
[02:03.720 --> 02:08.680]  Keith Oberman is completely mentally ill.
[02:08.680 --> 02:12.760]  He is mentally ill and he is dangerous.
[02:12.760 --> 02:17.040]  When I yell and scream, it's because I'm angry, but I let myself do it.
[02:17.040 --> 02:18.440]  Let me explain the paradox.
[02:18.440 --> 02:20.400]  It's not an act, but it is.
[02:20.400 --> 02:24.800]  It's how I feel, but I let the dog off the leash.
[02:24.800 --> 02:32.080]  With Oberman, he is completely out of control, calling for foreign governments to work with
[02:32.080 --> 02:38.280]  him to overthrow Trump and then he begs the Russians to take Trump out.
[02:38.280 --> 02:43.400]  This is textbook sedition, textbook espionage.
[02:43.400 --> 02:50.360]  If I did something like this, I would be arrested within a day and I should be.
[02:50.360 --> 02:58.320]  And then I've got so many clips of professors today and yesterday saying kill white people,
[02:58.320 --> 03:02.640]  kill conservatives, kill libertarians and they've totally normalized it.
[03:02.640 --> 03:04.920]  We're not even human.
[03:04.920 --> 03:06.280]  And this is the climate.
[03:06.280 --> 03:14.840]  We're the danger, not Trump, not libertarians, not Christians, not conservatives.
[03:14.840 --> 03:15.840]  Liberals are not liberals.
[03:15.840 --> 03:17.960]  They are a fascist crazy cult.
[03:17.960 --> 03:23.240]  Now, even Lester Holt had to admit that Trump has a good point handing him a dossier of
[03:23.240 --> 03:28.280]  20 plus Democrats calling for coming to be fired even last week.
[03:28.280 --> 03:29.560]  And he had to admit they had a point.
[03:29.560 --> 03:31.240]  No, he has more than a point.
[03:31.240 --> 03:32.840]  He wasn't investigation.
[03:32.840 --> 03:36.920]  He wasn't being investigated for Russian collusion, but the Democrats keep selling it.
[03:36.920 --> 03:41.640]  And then Comey is running around doing whatever he wants, won't investigate illegal leaks.
[03:41.640 --> 03:43.040]  So Trump took action.
[03:43.040 --> 03:47.080]  Here he is with Lester Holt.
[03:47.080 --> 03:51.040]  Grandstander, the FBI has been in turmoil.
[03:51.040 --> 03:52.040]  You know that.
[03:52.040 --> 03:53.040]  I know that.
[03:53.040 --> 03:54.040]  Everybody knows that.
[03:54.040 --> 03:57.360]  You take a look at the FBI a year ago.
[03:57.360 --> 04:01.400]  It was in virtual turmoil less than a year ago.
[04:01.400 --> 04:03.000]  What has it recovered from that?
[04:03.000 --> 04:06.520]  Monday you met with the Deputy Attorney General, Rob Rosenstein.
[04:06.520 --> 04:08.640]  Did you ask for a recommendation?
[04:08.640 --> 04:12.200]  What I did is I was going to fire Comey.
[04:12.200 --> 04:13.200]  My decision.
[04:13.200 --> 04:14.200]  It was not...
[04:14.200 --> 04:15.200]  You had made the decision before they came in the room.
[04:15.200 --> 04:17.600]  I was going to fire Comey.
[04:17.600 --> 04:20.200]  There's no good time to do it, by the way.
[04:20.200 --> 04:24.320]  Because in your letter, you said I accepted their recommendations, so you had already
[04:24.320 --> 04:25.320]  made the decision.
[04:25.320 --> 04:26.920]  Oh, I was going to fire regardless of recommendation.
[04:26.920 --> 04:27.920]  So there was really room.
[04:27.920 --> 04:29.080]  He made a recommendation.
[04:29.080 --> 04:33.280]  He's highly respected, very good guy, very smart guy.
[04:33.280 --> 04:36.360]  The Democrats like him, the Republicans like him.
[04:36.360 --> 04:37.760]  He made a recommendation.
[04:37.760 --> 04:40.800]  But regardless of recommendation, I was going to fire Comey.
[04:40.800 --> 04:43.640]  Let me ask you about your termination letter to Mr. Comey.
[04:43.640 --> 04:44.640]  You're right.
[04:44.640 --> 04:48.960]  I greatly appreciate you informing me on three separate occasions that I am not under investigation.
[04:48.960 --> 04:51.240]  Why did you put that in there?
[04:51.240 --> 04:52.240]  Because he told me that.
[04:52.240 --> 04:53.240]  I mean, he told me that.
[04:53.240 --> 04:55.740]  He told you weren't under investigation with regard to the Russian investigation?
[04:55.740 --> 04:57.000]  Yeah, and I heard that from others.
[04:57.000 --> 04:58.000]  I think...
[04:58.000 --> 04:59.000]  Was it in a phone call?
[04:59.000 --> 05:00.000]  Yes.
[05:00.000 --> 05:01.000]  They'll be right back.
[05:01.000 --> 05:02.000]  Stay with us.
[05:02.000 --> 05:04.680]  So today, I want to talk about killing white people in context.
[05:04.680 --> 05:13.040]  A Texas A&M professor says that some white people may have to die in order to solve racism
[05:13.040 --> 05:15.040]  and bring about true equality.
[05:15.040 --> 05:19.800]  When we have this conversation about violence or killing white people, it has to be looked
[05:19.800 --> 05:20.800]  at in this kind of historical term.
[05:20.800 --> 05:25.280]  And the fact that we've had no one address like how relevant and how solidified this
[05:25.280 --> 05:29.480]  kind of tradition is for black people saying, look, in order to be equal, in order to be
[05:29.480 --> 05:32.040]  liberated, some white people may have to die.
[05:32.040 --> 05:37.440]  That was Professor Tommy Curry on the Reading News Review podcast who went on to say that
[05:37.440 --> 05:42.160]  the movie Django Unchained made killing white people look fun.
[05:42.160 --> 05:46.720]  But in reality, it should be part of a serious discussion.
[05:46.720 --> 05:53.120]  So far, it is unknown if law enforcement officials or Homeland Security are investigating Tommy
[05:53.120 --> 05:57.000]  Curry for his violent, racist, and terroristic threats.
[05:57.000 --> 06:01.320]  And you can learn more right now at Infowars.com.
[06:01.320 --> 06:03.200]  Today we call it bone broth.
[06:03.200 --> 06:07.360]  And for thousands of years, our ancestors enjoyed its benefits before it became a loss
[06:07.360 --> 06:09.760]  to our modern diet, a processed junk.
[06:09.760 --> 06:14.960]  We are now introducing Caveman by InfowarsLive.com, the ultimate and true paleo nutrition with
[06:14.960 --> 06:21.160]  bone broth, turmeric root, chaga mushroom, and seven total primal superfoods in a single
[06:21.160 --> 06:23.560]  great tasting formula, Caveman.
[06:23.560 --> 06:27.520]  It's those people living in the wilds having to actually build civilization that are our
[06:27.520 --> 06:28.520]  superior ancestors.
[06:28.520 --> 06:31.520]  And we need to do everything we can to recapture that.
[06:31.520 --> 06:34.200]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal.
[06:34.200 --> 06:39.200]  You used the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking, but you used the bones for strength
[06:39.200 --> 06:43.680]  from the outside structure full of minerals and Kiko factors to the marrow that produces
[06:43.680 --> 06:44.760]  the blood for the body.
[06:44.760 --> 06:47.320]  This is the engine of the life essence.
[06:47.320 --> 06:51.640]  I'm a long way from the Caveman my ancestors were, but I'm sure as hell trying to get back
[06:51.640 --> 06:55.280]  to that essence that made us what we were, and this is a big part of it.
[06:55.280 --> 06:59.720]  I know you're going to want to check out Caveman, ultimate paleo formula for yourself at InfowarsLive.com
[06:59.720 --> 07:00.720]  today.
[07:00.720 --> 07:04.400]  A new shipment of Biotrusillinium is now available at InfowarsLive.com.
[07:04.400 --> 07:06.280]  We've been sold out for months.
[07:06.280 --> 07:11.400]  Our one of a kind InfowarsLive Biotrusillinium formula is now back in stock at InfowarsLive.com.
[07:11.400 --> 07:15.560]  This is the true selenium formula that has rocked the nutraceutical industry to its core.
[07:15.560 --> 07:19.920]  Nearly every other selenium supplement on the market is produced with synthetic selenium,
[07:19.920 --> 07:25.200]  but Biotrusillinium is made from a source of 100% organic mustard seed.
[07:25.200 --> 07:28.560]  The effects of the essential trace mineral selenium are well known.
[07:28.560 --> 07:33.760]  From supporting the thyroid gland and immune system to DNA production and eyesight, Biotrusillinium
[07:33.760 --> 07:38.920]  is also the perfect supercharger to survival shield X2 nascent iodine, as both help support
[07:38.920 --> 07:40.840]  a healthy thyroid and many other systems.
[07:40.840 --> 07:45.840]  Visit InfowarsLive.com to order your bottle of Biotrusillinium before we sell it again.
[07:45.840 --> 07:50.120]  That's InfowarsLive.com to secure your selenium and other key products that don't only help
[07:50.120 --> 07:54.880]  yourself and your family, but also fund our operation against the globalist, A360 Wham.
[07:54.880 --> 07:56.960]  We didn't ask for this fight, but we're in this fight.
[07:56.960 --> 08:20.320]  This is the time to support Infowars, that's InfowarsLive.com.
[08:20.320 --> 08:27.800]  If you can't see that the global, corporate, crony capitalist, anti-free market, eugenicist-based
[08:27.800 --> 08:35.640]  system is attacking Trump, is attacking Le Pen, is attacking Farage, is attacking Jones,
[08:35.640 --> 08:40.480]  is attacking Drudge, is attacking anybody who's independent and wants to have a free
[08:40.480 --> 08:44.160]  market, open free society, you're blind.
[08:44.160 --> 08:51.200]  Donald Trump is anti-establishment, he's a total dark horse, an absolute rogue to the
[08:51.200 --> 08:59.560]  establishment and anyone who has half a brain would be totally behind Trump right now.
[08:59.560 --> 09:03.600]  In fact, I can't believe he's fighting this hard.
[09:03.600 --> 09:10.560]  I said if he got 30, 40% down in his first four years, he'd be as great as George Washington.
[09:10.560 --> 09:16.240]  Just killing TPP, just getting our industry turned back on, just cutting U.N. funding
[09:16.240 --> 09:21.640]  by 50%, just smashing the globalist, Saudi creation ISIS.
[09:21.640 --> 09:29.920]  One of those things is unbelievably, irrevocably damaging to globalism.
[09:29.920 --> 09:32.600]  Trump wants to keep cash.
[09:32.600 --> 09:35.680]  Trump wants to keep the United States preeminent.
[09:35.680 --> 09:37.200]  Trump wants to rebuild our military.
[09:37.200 --> 09:41.840]  I saw all these headlines yesterday where it was Tim under his breath, it picked up
[09:41.840 --> 09:45.760]  by the press saying, we're going back to GD steam.
[09:45.760 --> 09:52.960]  And that's because for the decade, they've tried to make robotic catapults systems work
[09:52.960 --> 09:59.000]  to launch fighters off the decks of aircraft carriers when we invented that after World
[09:59.000 --> 10:01.640]  War One.
[10:01.640 --> 10:07.960]  They can't make the robotic systems work right for a decade, just like all those fighters
[10:07.960 --> 10:16.280]  that cost $2 billion a piece and an F-16 or an F-15 can defeat them from 1980.
[10:16.280 --> 10:19.280]  So I'm somebody that reads weapons quarterly.
[10:19.280 --> 10:22.800]  I'm somebody that stays up on basic weapons systems.
[10:22.800 --> 10:30.720]  And I know the Navy has had a nightmare with trying to replace their steam systems, the
[10:30.720 --> 10:33.120]  catapult airplanes off.
[10:33.120 --> 10:36.440]  The Chinese are trying to launch aircraft carriers.
[10:36.440 --> 10:43.480]  They still can't figure it out because America was always number one in engineering.
[10:43.480 --> 10:45.280]  The French couldn't build the Panama Canal.
[10:45.280 --> 10:47.000]  The Germans couldn't build the Panama Canal.
[10:47.000 --> 10:54.280]  We did when they failed, but it just goes on and on.
[10:54.280 --> 10:55.760]  He's talked to top engineers.
[10:55.760 --> 10:57.320]  They say, stay with steam.
[10:57.320 --> 10:59.320]  So he says, that's it.
[10:59.320 --> 11:02.080]  We're not going to have aircraft crashing and all this stuff.
[11:02.080 --> 11:03.080]  We're going back to steam.
[11:03.080 --> 11:04.560]  And they go, oh, he's a troglodyte.
[11:04.560 --> 11:07.720]  He's an idiot.
[11:07.720 --> 11:08.720]  But then you go research.
[11:08.720 --> 11:11.280]  And I went, you know, I heard they have a problem with steam for a decade.
[11:11.280 --> 11:13.120]  I went and researched it for like 20 minutes.
[11:13.120 --> 11:20.120]  All these articles of how they can't make the new systems work right.
[11:20.120 --> 11:23.160]  Trump tried to get rid of the F-23 and all the rest of that, but they got in the space
[11:23.160 --> 11:24.160]  about it.
[11:24.160 --> 11:25.160]  So he said, fine.
[11:25.160 --> 11:31.400]  It's just, but notice he relaunched the manned space program that the globalists had killed.
[11:31.400 --> 11:35.560]  So he believes in humans being involved and controlling our environment and building a
[11:35.560 --> 11:43.800]  world for humans, not a world for globalist technocrats who think we're obsolete.
[11:43.800 --> 11:46.800]  It isn't that Trump doesn't know how to use technology.
[11:46.800 --> 11:54.640]  He doesn't trust it because he knows the people that have built it have put Trojan
[11:54.640 --> 11:57.880]  horses and backdoors into all of it.
[11:57.880 --> 12:03.760]  The genetic engineering, the smartphones, all of it, all of it.
[12:03.760 --> 12:08.760]  Man, I have got so much news to cover.
[12:08.760 --> 12:09.760]  So much good news.
[12:09.760 --> 12:14.440]  Pence gave a big speech, the vice president, they'd sworn they'd stick up for Christians.
[12:14.440 --> 12:19.320]  The UN admits in the last decade, persecution of Christians is more than doubled.
[12:19.320 --> 12:22.120]  Hundreds of thousands are killed every year.
[12:22.120 --> 12:24.960]  And Pence gave out those numbers.
[12:24.960 --> 12:32.200]  He went over those numbers and admitted there's a Christian genocide happening globally.
[12:32.200 --> 12:35.360]  Those clips are coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[12:35.360 --> 12:41.440]  And instead of backing radical Islam out of Saudi Arabia, we're now fighting it.
[12:41.440 --> 12:45.800]  Instead of having our government put radical Muslims in charge and take out Iraq and take
[12:45.800 --> 12:48.320]  out Syria and take out Libya, take out our allies.
[12:48.320 --> 12:52.840]  Yeah, Libya have been our ally for eight years and take out Fuzi Mubarak in Egypt, our ally
[12:52.840 --> 12:53.840]  for 32 years.
[12:53.840 --> 12:58.800]  Instead of that, that's all changing and this isn't just going to be senseless war to install
[12:58.800 --> 13:00.120]  radical Muslims.
[13:00.120 --> 13:04.600]  This is targeted when they attack countries or Christians to defeat them.
[13:04.600 --> 13:09.120]  Now it can certainly be turned into a wider war, something McMaster's tried to do and
[13:09.120 --> 13:10.120]  Trump's killed.
[13:10.120 --> 13:16.600]  But right now, we have to clean up Obama's mess and that's happening.
[13:16.600 --> 13:22.560]  This is credited with undercoming mass voter fraud vows to aid Trump probe project Veritas.
[13:22.560 --> 13:24.680]  Trump launches commission to investigate voter fraud.
[13:24.680 --> 13:30.840]  That's got a real mad.
[13:30.840 --> 13:31.840]  This is big.
[13:31.840 --> 13:34.280]  China warms up to block chain currency.
[13:34.280 --> 13:39.400]  That's a digital currency may ditch paper money altogether for social control.
[13:39.400 --> 13:44.480]  I'm all for digital money to compete with government currencies, but we do not need to
[13:44.480 --> 13:52.240]  have a central government digital currency that brings total control.
[13:52.240 --> 13:57.760]  Soros expands effort to keep net neutrality censorship in place under the name of net
[13:57.760 --> 13:58.760]  neutrality.
[13:58.760 --> 14:01.320]  We'll explain that.
[14:01.320 --> 14:05.800]  That's just some of what we've got here and it ties in what's happening with Pence with
[14:05.800 --> 14:07.480]  this headline.
[14:07.480 --> 14:13.440]  There's video of this fight the Jews and kill them outrage and Copenhagen and Eman's
[14:13.440 --> 14:16.120]  call.
[14:16.120 --> 14:21.000]  Twitter says calling through the about refugee crisis is hateful conduct pointing out objective
[14:21.000 --> 14:26.760]  facts that there are few women and children migrants could be illegal that report on national
[14:26.760 --> 14:29.200]  news in Europe.
[14:29.200 --> 14:35.640]  Hungary and Slovakia taking EU to court over migrant quotas where they're ordered to let
[14:35.640 --> 14:43.600]  them in or be fine that's right school to hold Muslim girls only prom.
[14:43.600 --> 14:49.280]  It didn't hundreds of thousands Obama brought in everywhere I went in Austin yesterday including
[14:49.280 --> 14:51.360]  a suburb.
[14:51.360 --> 14:59.120]  I went in two shops a Starbucks and then I went to pool supply place and there were
[14:59.120 --> 15:03.080]  like seven people in the Starbucks three of them were young Muslim girls with hoods over
[15:03.080 --> 15:08.880]  their heads drinking coffee after school that I went to pool supply place same deal and all
[15:08.880 --> 15:13.080]  I'm telling you is imagine if you were in Saudi Arabia and Saudi Arabia they were walking
[15:13.080 --> 15:16.600]  to stores and there were Christians and women with lipstick on and high heels everywhere
[15:16.600 --> 15:19.720]  they start physically attacking you.
[15:19.720 --> 15:25.160]  But here we're tolerant so I'm just saying we're Latin in people in mass that are not
[15:25.160 --> 15:32.160]  tolerant that are the most oppressive cult like people on earth and it freaks me out.
[15:32.160 --> 15:36.440]  You bet I'm freaked out you bet I am.
[15:36.440 --> 15:42.400]  I've got three dollars ladies and gentlemen and I don't like it oh but the feminist all
[15:42.400 --> 15:50.360]  where the hajib is a sign of their feminism I get it you got Stockholm syndrome literally.
[15:50.360 --> 15:55.680]  By the way the media has this firestorm going right now that Trump admits that the Russian
[15:55.680 --> 16:00.320]  probe was part of Comey firing that's because he's being honest he said yeah it's his flip
[16:00.320 --> 16:06.560]  flopping it's him thinking he's the boss it's him not investigating Susan Rice and her leaks
[16:06.560 --> 16:11.160]  and how he's been spied on and saying that the president is crazy that he's been spied
[16:11.160 --> 16:16.440]  on when it's come out he was being spied on that's outrageous to have the FBI director
[16:16.440 --> 16:23.400]  saying that about anybody that's above him in the chain of command and saying he got
[16:23.400 --> 16:27.800]  nauseous that he may have helped Trump win all this other crap and Trump goes on top
[16:27.800 --> 16:34.240]  of it it's a whole Democrat narrative made up that I'm with the Russians they lost the
[16:34.240 --> 16:38.120]  election that's why they're upset they lost in the Electoral College which is very hard
[16:38.120 --> 16:45.920]  to do and gerrymandered towards them and then they spin it oh he's flip flopping he's
[16:45.920 --> 16:50.480]  he's you know there's a lot of reasons Comey got axed and Trump is tweeting out all these
[16:50.480 --> 16:55.280]  videos some of the which we've produced showing the Democrats saying get rid of him get rid
[16:55.280 --> 17:04.840]  of him up to last week but let's go back first to him with Lester Holt yesterday laying out
[17:04.840 --> 17:08.480]  that no he went with the recommendations but he was already gonna fire Comey he was thinking
[17:08.480 --> 17:12.040]  about firing Comey the day he got elected and guess what I don't just have to believe
[17:12.040 --> 17:17.680]  Trump I have him two nights after he was elected or sworn in saying I'm thinking about firing
[17:17.680 --> 17:23.560]  him I don't know I'm gonna keep him and that was on like the 22nd of January so I've got
[17:23.560 --> 17:28.540]  a memory see so I know Trump's like the North Star unless he changes the policy then he'll
[17:28.540 --> 17:32.680]  explain why that's on a flip flop he's very steady let's go to the part of the Lester
[17:32.680 --> 17:37.600]  Holt interview. Regardless of recommendation I was going to fire Comey. Let me ask you
[17:37.600 --> 17:42.400]  about your termination letter to Mr. Comey you're right I greatly appreciate you informing
[17:42.400 --> 17:46.560]  me on three separate occasions that I am not under investigation. Why did you put that
[17:46.560 --> 17:50.440]  in there? Because he told me that I mean he told me that. He told you weren't under investigation
[17:50.440 --> 17:55.640]  and I heard that from others. Was it in a phone call did you meet face to face? I had
[17:55.640 --> 17:59.560]  a dinner with him he wanted to have dinner because he wanted to stay on we had a very
[17:59.560 --> 18:05.000]  nice dinner. He asked for the dinner. At dinner was arranged I think he asked for the dinner
[18:05.000 --> 18:12.080]  and he wanted to stay on as the FBI head and I said you know consider we'll see what happens
[18:12.080 --> 18:17.080]  but we had a very nice dinner and at that time he told me you are not under investigation
[18:17.080 --> 18:21.080]  which I knew anyway. That was one meeting. First of all when you're under investigation
[18:21.080 --> 18:27.000]  you're giving all sorts of documents and everything I knew I wasn't under and I heard it was stated
[18:27.000 --> 18:30.920]  at the committee yet some committee level that I wasn't no more. So that didn't come
[18:30.920 --> 18:34.400]  directly from him? Then during a phone call he said it and then during another phone call
[18:34.400 --> 18:38.800]  he said it. So he said it once at dinner and then he said it twice during phone call.
[18:38.800 --> 18:43.720]  Did you call him? In one case I called him in one case he called me. And did you ask
[18:43.720 --> 18:48.880]  him? Am I under investigation? I actually asked him yes I said if it's possible would
[18:48.880 --> 18:54.400]  you let me know am I under investigation? He said you are not under investigation.
[18:54.400 --> 18:58.720]  But he's given sworn testimony that there is an ongoing investigation into the Trump
[18:58.720 --> 19:04.760]  campaign and possible collusion with the Russian government. You were the centerpiece of the
[19:04.760 --> 19:11.160]  Trump campaign. I know that I'm not under investigation. Me personally I'm not talking
[19:11.160 --> 19:15.080]  about campaigns. I'm not talking about anything else. I'm not under investigation.
[19:15.080 --> 19:21.000]  That's right. Because Trump delegated all of it. Ladies and gentlemen it's known that
[19:21.000 --> 19:24.920]  the Clintons the Podestas all of them were on the Russian payroll but they weren't Russian
[19:24.920 --> 19:30.160]  agents. They were taking money from basically scores of countries. They were agents of China.
[19:30.160 --> 19:34.760]  Hillary has been an agent of China going back to Don Tyson. It's well known. It's all over
[19:34.760 --> 19:41.600]  the news since the 90s. Totally documented. But what's amazing is Trump's restoring our
[19:41.600 --> 19:47.200]  country, our sovereignty, our military and our energy. And they have the nerve to claim
[19:47.200 --> 19:52.040]  he's some Russian stooge. It's just outrageous bull. We'll come back and play more of the
[19:52.040 --> 19:55.400]  interviews straight ahead and then we'll play in the clips of Democrats calling for
[19:55.400 --> 20:11.920]  commies firing until they did a 180 on Monday.

[21:06.040 --> 21:10.960]  before it became a loss to our modern diets, a processed junk. We are now introducing Caveman

[21:27.040 --> 21:31.680]  superior ancestors and we need to do everything we can to recapture that. Everyone knew that
[21:31.680 --> 21:35.840]  you used all the parts of the animal. You used the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking
[21:35.840 --> 21:41.080]  but you used the bones for strength. From the outside structure full of minerals and
[21:41.080 --> 21:45.480]  key cofactors to the marrow that produces the blood for the body. This is the engine
[21:45.480 --> 21:50.200]  of the life essence. I'm a long way from the caveman my ancestors were but I'm sure as
[21:50.200 --> 21:54.400]  they'll try to get back to that essence that made us what we were and this is a big part
[21:54.400 --> 21:58.160]  of it. I know you're going to want to check out Caveman ultimate paleo formula for yourself

[24:05.480 --> 24:21.200]  So, the media everywhere as you know is spinning things that Trump got caught flip flopping
[24:21.200 --> 24:27.200]  and giving different stories. Like he's, you know, a teenage kid caught breaking into
[24:27.200 --> 24:31.880]  a liquor store at 2 in the morning and the cops catch him with a bag of cash and pre-bottles
[24:31.880 --> 24:37.240]  of whiskey and he says, oh, my dad works there. Oh, I own the liquor store. Oh, I found this
[24:37.240 --> 24:41.600]  money on the side of the street. But that's not what's happening in an interview with
[24:41.600 --> 24:46.960]  no notes. The president's like, yeah, he's flip flopping everywhere. He won't investigate
[24:46.960 --> 24:50.920]  leaks. He's not doing a very good job. And this whole rush of things is completely made
[24:50.920 --> 24:57.080]  up and I'm sick of it. And he told me I'm not under investigation. And he goes on to
[24:57.080 --> 25:04.280]  say the Russians must really be laughing at us. This is idiotic. Why don't you investigate
[25:04.280 --> 25:08.600]  the Clintons? Why don't you look at how they're involved with the Russians and the uranium
[25:08.600 --> 25:09.600]  deal?
[25:09.600 --> 25:15.600]  But see, all that hits the cutting room floor. That's why Trump has to tweak that. That's
[25:15.600 --> 25:21.080]  why he came out today and he said, I'm done with Lester Holt and all the media. I'm going
[25:21.080 --> 25:25.760]  to hand out written statements now so they can't deceive the public. And that's what
[25:25.760 --> 25:33.360]  I've been saying. Mr. President, Mr. President, a couple nights a week, maybe Tuesday nights
[25:33.360 --> 25:39.120]  and Thursday nights or Saturday night, whatever you choose, do a live hour with computer screens,
[25:39.120 --> 25:44.640]  documents, walk around like across between Dr. Phil, you know, meets Alex Jones, meets
[25:44.640 --> 25:51.840]  Donald Trump, meets Ross Perot, meets Glenn Beck with his chalkboards, and just go over
[25:51.840 --> 25:59.000]  the facts for people. It'll have 50 million views every night. It will destroy them. And
[25:59.000 --> 26:05.040]  you can play the clips of the Democrats all saying, Fire Comey, Fire Comey, Fire Comey,
[26:05.040 --> 26:08.680]  Fire Comey, Fire Comey, Fire Comey, Fire Comey, Fire Comey, Fire Comey, Fire Comey,
[26:08.680 --> 26:16.560]  Fire Comey, never said Fire Comey and have the record skip sound. Trump says, made up
[26:16.560 --> 26:21.800]  Russia story, part of decision to Fire Comey. Of course, Trump was thinking of this Russia
[26:21.800 --> 26:30.840]  thing when he decided to fire a showboat coming. Russia ties made up. Yeah. And then we know
[26:30.840 --> 26:36.080]  they wouldn't investigate them for their ties that are confirmed because Comey is deputy
[26:36.080 --> 26:40.120]  directors, all of them, a bunch of Democrats. Give my other Democrats. They're disgusting.
[26:40.120 --> 26:46.200]  They all got put in power by Obama. And if you don't know that Obama broke the law and
[26:46.200 --> 26:50.280]  got rid of our borders and did whatever he wanted and sold out our jobs and created
[26:50.280 --> 26:55.640]  ISIS. And if you don't know that's treason, you don't know what it is. And the word is
[26:55.640 --> 27:02.080]  like 85% of the FBI absolutely knows what's going on. But it's the top is eight years
[27:02.080 --> 27:08.600]  of Democrat rats. And Bush was a globalist as well. So God help our country. We need
[27:08.600 --> 27:14.600]  to just clean house people. Well, if Trump's a Russian agent, we need more like him, right?
[27:14.600 --> 27:22.080]  Our military, our sovereignty, our jobs. Give me a break. You've got all these foreign governments
[27:22.080 --> 27:27.360]  coming in. That's what globalism is and ganging up on our country. And they got the nerve
[27:27.360 --> 27:30.640]  when they're the ones selling our nation out to say Trump's the one. Here's Trump on
[27:30.640 --> 27:38.520]  the whole Russia canard. But regardless of recommendation, I was going to fire. Let me
[27:38.520 --> 27:43.080]  ask you about your termination letter to Mr. Comey. You're right. I greatly appreciate
[27:43.080 --> 27:47.560]  you informing me on three separate occasions that I am not under investigation. Why did
[27:47.560 --> 27:51.120]  you put that in there? Because he told me that I mean, he told me he told you one under
[27:51.120 --> 27:56.120]  investigation. And I heard that from others. I think was it in a phone call? Did you meet
[27:56.120 --> 28:00.520]  face to face? I had a dinner with him. He wanted to have dinner because he wanted to stay on.
[28:00.520 --> 28:05.000]  We had a very nice dinner. Okay, so I wanted to add that where again, he's on record saying
[28:05.000 --> 28:08.600]  that Trump reportedly says you better watch out. There might be recordings of what you
[28:08.600 --> 28:12.280]  really said coming before you start lying and leaking. We've got records. You know, the
[28:12.280 --> 28:16.880]  phone calls are all recorded. Comey knows that. So here is the clip on the Russian situation.
[28:16.880 --> 28:22.920]  He made a recommendation. He's highly respected, very good guy, very smart guy. The Democrats
[28:22.920 --> 28:28.440]  like him. The Republicans like him. He made a recommendation. But regardless of recommendation,
[28:28.440 --> 28:34.640]  I was going to fire call me knowing there was no good time to do it. And in fact, when
[28:34.640 --> 28:41.040]  I decided to just do it, I said to myself, I said, you know, this Russia thing with Trump
[28:41.040 --> 28:46.680]  and Russia is a made up story. It's an excuse by the Democrats for having lost an election
[28:46.680 --> 28:50.720]  that they should have won. And the reason they should have won it is the electoral college
[28:50.720 --> 28:55.840]  is almost impossible for a Republican to win very hard because you start off at such a
[28:55.840 --> 29:00.660]  disadvantage. So everybody was thinking they should have won the election. This was an
[29:00.660 --> 29:06.560]  excuse for having lost an election. That's right. And then Trump tried to leave him alone.
[29:06.560 --> 29:10.760]  He tried to not have him indicted. And they all try to have him removed. Mr. President,
[29:10.760 --> 29:14.400]  that's an example of why you've got to just follow justice and not try to compromise.
[29:14.400 --> 29:18.560]  They're not going to compromise with you. They want to defeat this country. They want
[29:18.560 --> 29:24.840]  to overwhelm us. They want to dominate the nation. They're globalist. They're anti American.
[29:24.840 --> 29:29.880]  They come back. I've got several master clips of Democrats over and over again calling for
[29:29.880 --> 29:35.200]  Comey's firing, but now they've changed their tune saying they never did that. Or Hillary
[29:35.200 --> 29:39.400]  had real reasons to fire him. Trump doesn't. That's Hillary's latest flip-flopping. And
[29:39.400 --> 29:47.160]  then Heath Oberman has committed a blaring, clear cut textbook unavoidable crime. He must
[29:47.160 --> 29:50.600]  be prosecuted. He is organizing active sedition.
[29:50.600 --> 29:57.240]  On the march, the empire's on the run. That's being on Alex Jones and the GCN radio is organizing
[29:57.240 --> 30:02.680]  covered operations against the president with foreign powers. Last week, a study was released
[30:02.680 --> 30:07.080]  showing the differences between vaccinated kids and non vaccinated kids. Infowars.com
[30:07.080 --> 30:11.000]  covered this, pointing out the pushback of these studies being censored while more pushback
[30:11.000 --> 30:15.320]  has begun. The Boston Herald published an editorial from the entire editorial staff,
[30:15.320 --> 30:19.720]  which is now calling for anyone pushing anti vaccine rhetoric to be hung. The well written
[30:19.720 --> 30:24.280]  legal speak quote is lying to vulnerable people about the health and safety of their children
[30:24.280 --> 30:28.920]  ought to be a hanging offense. This after insinuating that anti vaccine people are responsible
[30:28.920 --> 30:34.040]  for a measles outbreak in a Somali community in Minnesota. This story claims as fact, vaccines
[30:34.040 --> 30:38.600]  don't cause autism when some have it already listed as a side effect. Of course, the irony
[30:38.600 --> 30:42.360]  of their statement regarding hanging people who lie about the health and safety of children
[30:42.360 --> 30:47.240]  is it ultimately would fall back on them if they do indeed promote the idea that vaccines cannot
[30:47.240 --> 30:52.280]  be linked to autism, a blatant lie about the health and safety of children. My guess is this same
[30:52.280 --> 30:56.840]  editorial staff would support abortion, but somehow they don't believe that is a threat to
[30:56.840 --> 31:01.800]  the lives and safety of children. For Infowars.com, this is Owen Schreuer. Hey everyone,

[33:31.400 --> 33:43.480]  all I'm offering is the truth, nothing more. The answer to 1984 is 1776. You're listening to the
[33:43.480 --> 33:48.520]  Alex Jones show. You know Spicer's done some good work but he's been like a deer in the headlights
[33:48.520 --> 33:55.720]  so he's been replaced the last few days with Sarah Huckabee Sanders who isn't as good looking as a
[33:55.720 --> 34:01.480]  guilfoil but I gotta tell you she's super sharp and she just destroys these reporters when they're
[34:01.480 --> 34:05.800]  attacking the president and all the hypocrisy so we're gonna play that in a few minutes and play
[34:05.800 --> 34:10.680]  some of these clubs and then I'm gonna get into Putin's response saying it's your country I'm not
[34:10.680 --> 34:19.080]  involved this is all ridiculous then he goes in place hockey makes a bunch of goals and then he
[34:19.080 --> 34:23.880]  falls down twice and I mean he goes oh not so tough you fell down forget what you think of Putin
[34:23.880 --> 34:31.320]  he's the guy in the arena so the press is literally acting like the people that Teddy
[34:31.320 --> 34:35.240]  Roosevelt talked about that'll attack the man in the arena we'll talk about how he stumbled or how he
[34:35.240 --> 34:41.560]  fell but thank god we'll never be one of those timid souls who never actually get in the arena
[34:42.280 --> 34:50.840]  it's just crazy so first off ladies and gentlemen we are listeners supported and it is the folks

[37:15.240 --> 37:20.280]  and explained that it's not just 25% off retail 25% off the normal sale so you've got these systems

[38:07.400 --> 38:11.880]  into the big news if you just joined us you know there's a firestorm they're trying to bring trump
[38:11.880 --> 38:18.760]  down the whole power structure the entire media is lying about him twisting infiltrating leaking
[38:18.760 --> 38:24.680]  he's got traders in his own midst because most people are cowards and they're selling out of
[38:24.680 --> 38:30.040]  the system because they can't handle the heat in the kitchen and trump has come out and said
[38:30.040 --> 38:34.920]  coming was unreliable he was doing a bad job he wouldn't investigate leaks he wouldn't investigate
[38:34.920 --> 38:41.720]  clinton crimes and the word is now from fbi sources this has been the national news is that the
[38:41.720 --> 38:46.840]  clinton criminal investigation is about to reopen oh you want to criminally investigate trump with no
[38:46.840 --> 38:52.120]  evidence you want to wire tap him and then admit you were wiretapping him and then lie and say you
[38:52.120 --> 38:57.320]  weren't because no evidence was found it's all going to come out you want to punch trump in the face
[38:57.320 --> 39:04.280]  he's always said he's a counter puncher the defense is always stronger than the offense if
[39:04.280 --> 39:10.440]  you're in the right and trump knows that so get ready criminals i told you days ago trump is taking
[39:10.440 --> 39:16.360]  the gloves off and that's exactly what's happening right now now let's go through some of these
[39:16.360 --> 39:21.080]  riveting clips and i'm getting to keith oberman openly calling for mass criminal activity i mean
[39:21.080 --> 39:28.520]  if he doesn't get arrested or put in a mental ward bare minimum then we're in a whole new climate here
[39:28.520 --> 39:36.920]  he's calling for foreign governments to help aid in the bed in a violent overthrow of our executive
[39:36.920 --> 39:45.720]  branch i mean this is just unprecedented slowness but first let's uh go ahead now and get to this
[39:45.720 --> 39:52.920]  clip where she annihilates this guy sarah sanders exposes hypocritical democrat relations that were
[39:52.920 --> 39:59.080]  coming was fired this is from yesterday here it is i asked you directly yesterday if the president
[39:59.080 --> 40:05.880]  already decided to fire james comey when he met um with the uh the deputy attorney general
[40:05.880 --> 40:11.880]  attorney general and you said no also the vice president of the united states said directly
[40:11.880 --> 40:17.480]  the president acted to take the recommendation of the deputy attorney general to remove the fbi
[40:17.480 --> 40:23.720]  director uh shone spicer said directly it was all him remaining the deputy attorney general now we
[40:23.720 --> 40:30.120]  learned from the president directly that he had already decided to fire james comey so why were
[40:30.120 --> 40:35.240]  so many people giving answers did just hey domine let's back that up five seconds please it's called
[40:35.240 --> 40:42.600]  a consensus you know if you have a jury of 12 people and then they agree it's not that they're
[40:42.600 --> 40:47.560]  all uh even agreeing for the same reasons they all have different reasons overall but together
[40:47.560 --> 40:54.920]  it's called a consensus a consensus that the mainstream media are liars a consensus that
[40:54.920 --> 40:59.880]  they're elitist that have a stain for the american people a consensus that you can't be trusted a
[40:59.880 --> 41:06.520]  consensus that you're hacks a consensus that you're swine so days after they come out and say there
[41:06.520 --> 41:12.280]  were recommendations on and on and on he says yeah there were recommendations but i had my own
[41:12.280 --> 41:22.280]  reasons as well that's not him lying that's him being genuine something you try to twist something
[41:22.280 --> 41:29.720]  you try to misrepresent because trump's not a lawyer and not playing lawyer games let's go back
[41:29.720 --> 41:36.360]  to her response fire james comey so why were so many people giving answers that just weren't
[41:36.360 --> 41:41.560]  correct were you guys in the dark was the vice president misled again uh as i know you'd love
[41:41.560 --> 41:47.640]  to report that that we were misled and uh we want to create hold on jonathan you had i let you
[41:47.640 --> 41:53.080]  finish and read off every single one of those statements so uh unless you want to trade places
[41:53.080 --> 41:59.480]  i think it's my turn now um i think it's pretty simple i hadn't had a chance to have the conversation
[41:59.480 --> 42:05.800]  directly with the president to say i'd had several conversations with him but i didn't ask that question
[42:05.800 --> 42:10.280]  directly had you already made that decision i went off of the information that i had when i
[42:10.280 --> 42:14.680]  answered your question i've since had the conversation with him right before i walked on
[42:14.680 --> 42:19.640]  today and uh he laid it out very clearly he had already made that decision uh he'd been thinking
[42:19.640 --> 42:25.080]  about it for months which i did say yesterday uh and have said many times since and wednesday
[42:25.080 --> 42:31.160]  back it up again five seconds thank you he went on tv two days after he was sworn in with his wife
[42:31.160 --> 42:34.360]  and said i don't know i'm gonna keep coming we may get rid of him he's done some weird stuff
[42:34.360 --> 42:42.360]  and then later he just did so much weird things like going on tv and saying the president made
[42:42.360 --> 42:47.640]  him nauseous that he might have helped get him elected mildly nauseous and that he also
[42:48.360 --> 42:52.840]  thought that trump was crazy that obama was wiretapping him when it was in the front page
[42:52.840 --> 42:57.720]  of the new york times the washington post you name it that that obama was wiretapping him
[42:57.720 --> 43:01.640]  and then you think we're so stupid and don't have a memory you come back and say you never
[43:01.640 --> 43:05.880]  were wiretapping him because there's nothing in the wiretaps as the head of the intelligence
[43:05.880 --> 43:10.920]  committee has said in the house because he's read the transcripts there's no treason there's no
[43:10.920 --> 43:18.440]  collusion there's nothing with the russians nothing but setting up meetings with them that's normal
[43:19.240 --> 43:25.480]  and then they finally have lavaroth the foreign minister and the ambassador to the united states
[43:25.480 --> 43:30.440]  from russia in a meeting and they turned that into a giant conspiracy theory and said that
[43:30.440 --> 43:37.160]  trump's helping him plant listening devices in the oval office that's how crazy these people are
[43:37.160 --> 43:43.880]  let's go back to it yesterday and have said many times since and wednesday i think was the final
[43:43.880 --> 43:49.400]  straw that pushed him and the recommendation that he got from the deputy attorney general
[43:49.400 --> 43:54.120]  just further solidified his decision and again i think reaffirmed that he made the right one
[43:54.120 --> 43:57.880]  but was the vice president in the dark two is so far was the vice president in the dark two
[43:58.760 --> 44:04.520]  nobody was in the dark john he paused back it up no one's in the dark when the president finally
[44:06.200 --> 44:10.840]  did a tv interview he laid out the truth that he was sick of him that the guy was
[44:10.840 --> 44:15.480]  waffling all over the place that the democrats couldn't stand in that he said when he first
[44:15.480 --> 44:21.400]  got into office he might get rid of him and then he got recommended on top of what he'd already made
[44:21.400 --> 44:29.160]  the decision he's the president so notice the guy goes back to the talking point oh so you were
[44:29.160 --> 44:32.920]  kept from the dark oh you were misled when she just said she wasn't they just keep coming back with
[44:32.920 --> 44:37.320]  their lies that's why they're hated it's why they're disdained it's why they're disgusting so let's go
[44:37.320 --> 44:42.760]  back to this little man here it is the vice president in the dark two i nobody was in the dark
[44:42.760 --> 44:48.040]  jonathan you want to create this false narrative if we want to talk about uh contradicting statements
[44:48.040 --> 44:52.280]  and people that were maybe in the dark how about the democrats let's read a few of them you want
[44:52.280 --> 44:57.080]  to talk about them here's what democrats said not long ago about comey harry reid said comey should
[44:57.080 --> 45:02.440]  resign and be investigated by the senate senator chuck schumer said i don't have confidence in
[45:02.440 --> 45:07.400]  him any longer senator bernie sanders said it would not be a bad thing for the american people
[45:07.400 --> 45:13.320]  if comey resigned nancy polosi said comey was not in the right job former dnc chair debbie
[45:13.320 --> 45:18.760]  walzerman schultz said that she thought comey was no longer able to serve in a neutral incredible
[45:18.760 --> 45:24.840]  way president obama's advisor valerie jarrett reportedly urged him to fire comey just yesterday
[45:24.840 --> 45:29.480]  representative maxine water said that hillary clinton would have fired comey if you want to
[45:29.480 --> 45:34.520]  talk about people in the dark our story is consistent the president is the only person
[45:34.520 --> 45:39.560]  that can fire the director of the fbi he serves at the pleasure of the president the president made
[45:39.560 --> 45:44.760]  the decision it was the right decision the people that are in the dark today are the democrats
[45:44.760 --> 45:50.600]  they want to come out they want to talk about all of these uh they love comey and how great he was
[45:50.600 --> 45:54.520]  look at the facts the facts don't lie their statements are all right there i think it's
[45:54.520 --> 46:00.760]  extremely clear that uh and frankly i think it's kind of sad in washington we finally had something
[46:00.760 --> 46:05.000]  that i think we should have all been able to agree on exactly that was that director comey
[46:05.000 --> 46:09.320]  shouldn't have been at the fbi but the democrats want to play partisan games and i think that's the
[46:09.320 --> 46:14.200]  most glaring thing that's being left out of all of your process wow she's good better than spicer
[46:16.280 --> 46:17.400]  put her brain
[46:20.120 --> 46:27.080]  in the brain case of uh the fox info babe we got something other they're both super smart how
[46:27.080 --> 46:31.800]  about have both those ladies up there tag teaming and we got a new fbi female director that'll throw
[46:31.800 --> 46:35.560]  it in the liberals faces i don't care if they're all women up there as long as they're constitutionalist
[46:35.560 --> 46:40.120]  give me a woman president right now let's do it as long as it's not king pen hillary but but getting
[46:40.120 --> 46:47.160]  back to that club i was thinking there comey was so hated by the democrats that if he ever
[46:47.160 --> 46:52.760]  then said yeah the investigation in russia's over they'd claim that he was being controlled by trump
[46:52.760 --> 46:58.440]  so trump basically had nothing else he could do but get rid of comey because comey had politicized
[46:58.440 --> 47:05.560]  things to the 10th degree now i want to get to over and after the break but first let's go to a few
[47:05.560 --> 47:10.840]  of these clips we put one of these together trump's been tweeting these out democrats should be
[47:10.840 --> 47:17.560]  ashamed it is the first thing uh that trump tweeted out and again this is just examples
[47:18.360 --> 47:23.240]  of the democrats saying how much they hate comey and then hoping you don't remember this
[47:23.240 --> 47:34.200]  uh comey acted in an outrageous way uh i think he should take a hard look at uh what he has done
[47:34.840 --> 47:38.680]  and i think it would not be a bad thing for the american people if he did step down and
[47:38.680 --> 47:44.360]  finally believe that uh jim comey should resign senator e of course did you want to see him gone
[47:45.560 --> 47:50.920]  so it's absolutely true that democrats have been very critical of james comey and many of us did
[47:50.920 --> 47:57.560]  call for his resignation hard to be a director of such an important institution uh when that trust
[47:57.560 --> 48:05.320]  is no longer there no it's classified and we can't tell you anything all i can tell you is the fbi
[48:05.320 --> 48:10.760]  director has no credibility fbi director not to send the letter comey ignored the warning and sent
[48:10.760 --> 48:19.240]  that letter to lamin even released internal fbi memos and interview notes i may have missed this
[48:19.240 --> 48:25.560]  for my 42 years here i've never seen anything like that comey can render his country now is to
[48:25.560 --> 48:30.840]  resign failing that jeff sessions should invite him for a meeting after he's confirmed as attorney
[48:30.840 --> 48:37.400]  general and ask for him to resign i i i i i i agree the wall street journal it's in the best sense
[48:37.400 --> 48:42.440]  to the country that stepped down joey you're fine frankly publicly about legal conduct the president
[48:42.440 --> 48:47.800]  or the fire comey immediately and he ought to initiate an investigation there needs to be
[48:47.800 --> 48:52.360]  restoration of the incredibly the fbi i mean that needed to be done i think he should resign
[48:52.360 --> 48:59.240]  because he's damaged the fbi's reputation the faith of the of the uh the people of the fbi
[48:59.240 --> 49:04.920]  is somewhat shaken in their leadership and i think that the faith of the country is in in the
[49:04.920 --> 49:11.400]  director of the fbi is somewhat perilous um given all of that i think the he ought to spend more
[49:11.400 --> 49:17.400]  time with his family the answer is that he resigns by midnight tonight or early enough that the world
[49:17.400 --> 49:26.280]  can know that maybe he's not in the right job i believe the comey letter was a foul deed i applaud
[49:26.280 --> 49:31.720]  what the director comey did i mean and that now they totally switch over now this is the lowest
[49:31.720 --> 49:38.200]  history history of the fbi he should pack his things and go i tank johnson the things that
[49:38.200 --> 49:45.560]  islands float i no longer have confidence tim walz another democrat and then the the rest of the
[49:45.560 --> 49:52.120]  video just shows uh is some of the tweets where the democrats are saying get rid of comey up in a
[49:52.120 --> 50:00.440]  total complete perfect flip flop the most precise 180 i've ever seen in politics with hillary just a
[50:00.440 --> 50:05.640]  week ago saying that he's the reason she lost that he was clearly working for trump and then
[50:05.640 --> 50:11.240]  trump does what the democrats are asking for what everybody wants while comey saying trump
[50:11.240 --> 50:16.840]  isn't under investigation for russia and they flip it around and say he got rid of him because
[50:16.840 --> 50:22.680]  coming was getting too close to the russia gate situation the witch hunt where democrats admit
[50:22.680 --> 50:30.120]  no evidence has ever been found so there you go and now they want a special prosecutor and
[50:30.120 --> 50:35.320]  a special counsel and special investigators and i've got a bunch of other videos coming up in
[50:35.320 --> 50:40.200]  the next hour with trump saying i may get rid of comey when he was first sworn in to office
[50:40.200 --> 50:51.320]  which is what he said again on lester holt on mbc only come back keith oberman keith oberman is
[50:53.240 --> 51:01.160]  i can look at his eyes he is truly mentally ill he is truly truly having a mental collapse many
[51:01.160 --> 51:05.400]  books have been written regarding the law of attraction but what if all these books are missing

[54:21.320 --> 54:26.280]  i don't know where to begin remember a few months ago when oberman said that our country has been
[54:26.280 --> 54:33.320]  taken over by the russians remember he said that this is russian scum he is a russian agent we are
[54:33.320 --> 54:47.160]  at now at war with russia russia scum and then he comes out in a video last night for gq and you
[54:47.160 --> 54:51.560]  look at his eyes if you're a radio listener go to info wars dot com we have the video posted
[54:51.560 --> 54:57.800]  he looks like he's completely mentally ill and like he's completely scared and like he's this
[54:57.800 --> 55:05.400]  five-year-old young boy who's afraid that crusty the clown's coming to killing and then he calls
[55:05.400 --> 55:13.320]  for foreign governments including russia to take trump out because now russia must know how evil
[55:13.320 --> 55:19.320]  he is and then here's trump weathering the storm restoring our republic getting our jobs back
[55:19.320 --> 55:24.520]  getting obamacare repealed in the house just over delivering total stalwart totally in control
[55:24.520 --> 55:31.320]  totally slick and it's like he's crazy he's evil he's bad we gotta the whole world's in danger
[55:33.160 --> 55:40.200]  this is mental illness but it's more than that it's called espionage it's called treason
[55:40.200 --> 55:50.120]  treason it's called aiding a foreign power to carry out criminal operations against your
[55:50.120 --> 55:56.360]  country it's called being guilty of high treason it's one thing trying to overthrow your government
[55:57.880 --> 56:03.880]  it's another thing when you do it with foreign powers then it's treason not just sedition
[56:04.760 --> 56:08.920]  and if he one thing if trump was really this foreign power and he was screwing us over like
[56:08.920 --> 56:13.160]  the globalists but instead he's actually an american who really is restoring the country
[56:13.160 --> 56:18.280]  with all the globalists coming after us that's what globalism is the un the imf the world bank
[56:18.280 --> 56:24.040]  the world trade organization uh the tpp trump is literally pulling us out of all that and reforming it
[56:25.320 --> 56:30.360]  cut you in funding by 50 but oberman turns it around now and says we've got to stop this
[56:30.360 --> 56:35.800]  american madman thought he was a russian agent we've got to stop him please russia
[56:35.800 --> 56:41.960]  help us take him out do something and i've watched oberman quite a bit he is literally
[56:41.960 --> 56:47.400]  having a mental breakdown here and is absolutely scared these people are crazy they thought they
[56:47.400 --> 56:52.680]  ran america that's their power trip that's their identity and now they've lost their identity and
[56:52.680 --> 56:57.480]  they are hitting the panic button and there's liberal professors everywhere calling to kill
[56:57.480 --> 57:03.560]  trump supporters calling to kill trump nothing's being done about it i mean we've got a guy for gq
[57:03.560 --> 57:13.800]  magazine reaching millions of people saying kill everybody that he basically disagrees with and
[57:13.800 --> 57:18.440]  that we're at war with russia and russia scum in fact here's the russia scum clip first here it is
[57:19.000 --> 57:23.800]  the nation and all of our freedoms hang by a thread and the military apparatus of this
[57:23.800 --> 57:30.920]  country is about to be handed over to scum who are beholden to scum russian scum all right now
[57:30.920 --> 57:34.840]  let's start going out to break with the first the clip where he calls on all intelligence agencies

[57:42.120 --> 57:46.920]  i'm keithal reminin this is the resistance i appeal to the intelligence agencies and the
[57:46.920 --> 57:53.240]  governments of what is left of the free world to them as entities entirities as bureaucracies
[57:53.240 --> 57:59.320]  making official decisions and to the individuals who make decisions of conscience to gchq and mi6
[57:59.320 --> 58:07.800]  in the uk to the bnd in germany the dgse in france the asis in australia and even to the gru in russia
[58:07.800 --> 58:12.360]  where they must already be profoundly aware that they have not merely helped put an amoral cynic
[58:12.360 --> 58:17.640]  in power here but an uncontrollable one all right let's stop there that is the problem he's not
[58:17.640 --> 58:22.200]  controlled by the globalist so now you're more honest you want the foreign powers who did metal

[1:00:16.040 --> 1:00:21.880]  that russia is scum that russia stole our election now he's come out with no proof of course of that
[1:00:21.880 --> 1:00:25.960]  and said foreign governments including russia help us overthrow trump you mean overthrow our
[1:00:25.960 --> 1:00:30.200]  government and don't worry the democrats are in major newspapers major magazines like the new yorker
[1:00:30.200 --> 1:00:35.320]  saying they're organizing a military attempted coup uh grabbing trump putting him in a patty wagon
[1:00:35.320 --> 1:00:40.200]  and all this craziness because he dare turn our economy back on get three and a half trillion

[1:00:45.080 --> 1:00:49.480]  giant screw job and then oberman now calls on foreign powers to come in and overthrow our
[1:00:49.480 --> 1:00:55.000]  president do you understand if he was a crazy guy on the street corner the cops wouldn't do anything
[1:00:55.000 --> 1:01:02.200]  the fbi everybody has to do something this is clear clear absolute organized crime trees and espionage
[1:01:02.200 --> 1:01:08.920]  calling on foreign powers for the coup is high treason it's punishable by
[1:01:10.600 --> 1:01:14.680]  being hung by the neck until dead's how the army still doesn't or firing squad i guess he can pick
[1:01:14.680 --> 1:01:19.720]  either one and i'm serious man if i was calling for foreign governments to come over through our
[1:01:19.720 --> 1:01:25.080]  country i deserve a firing squad let me tell you something 60 years ago he would be in front of a
[1:01:25.080 --> 1:01:31.240]  firing squad in about a month okay i'm serious and look how mentally ill he is that guy that grew
[1:01:31.240 --> 1:01:35.480]  up never in the real world a spoiled brat calling bathtub boy because he'd hide in the bathtub and
[1:01:35.480 --> 1:01:40.600]  wouldn't do his tv shows he's a total mental patient and then he wants to sit here and call for our
[1:01:40.600 --> 1:01:47.720]  president to be overthrown and just look how mentally ill he looks look at how weak his whole
[1:01:47.720 --> 1:01:52.520]  identity is in running the government and being a liberal fake and then now he isn't getting what he
[1:01:52.520 --> 1:01:57.640]  wants and he sees america coming back from the dead he's so pissed he now abandons the fact that
[1:01:57.640 --> 1:02:02.040]  trump's run by foreign powers because he's not and he wants foreign powers to come in see that's
[1:02:02.040 --> 1:02:07.800]  the traitor right there that's the anti-american scumbag i love america i love our republic

[1:04:25.400 --> 1:04:30.440]  already be profoundly aware that they have not merely helped put an amoral cynic in power here
[1:04:30.440 --> 1:04:36.840]  but an uncontrollable one whose madness is genuine and whose usefulness even to them is at an end

[1:04:59.480 --> 1:05:03.080]  trump you'll never put your system together last week a study was released showing the differences
[1:05:03.080 --> 1:05:07.880]  between vaccinated kids and non-vaccinated kids info wars dot com covered this pointing out the
[1:05:07.880 --> 1:05:12.520]  pushback of these studies being censored while more pushback has begun the boston herald published
[1:05:12.520 --> 1:05:17.560]  an editorial from the entire editorial staff which is now calling for anyone pushing anti-vaccine
[1:05:17.560 --> 1:05:22.520]  rhetoric to be hung the well-written legal speak quote is lying to vulnerable people about the
[1:05:22.520 --> 1:05:26.840]  health and safety of their children ought to be a hanging offense this after insinuating that
[1:05:26.840 --> 1:05:31.800]  anti-vaccine people are responsible for a measles outbreak in a somali community in minnesota this
[1:05:31.800 --> 1:05:37.400]  story claims as fact vaccines don't cause autism when some have it already listed as a side effect
[1:05:37.400 --> 1:05:41.400]  of course the irony of their statement regarding hanging people who lie about the health and safety
[1:05:41.400 --> 1:05:46.520]  of children is it ultimately would fall back on them if they do indeed promote the idea that vaccines
[1:05:46.520 --> 1:05:51.640]  cannot be linked to autism a blatant lie about the health and safety of children my guess is this
[1:05:51.640 --> 1:05:56.520]  same editorial staff would support abortion but somehow they don't believe that is a threat to

[1:08:28.840 --> 1:08:35.160]  fop scum like he's oberman and now it's coming out saying the russians stole the
[1:08:35.160 --> 1:08:39.320]  election window proof and saying we're at war with russia he's asked russia and other
[1:08:39.320 --> 1:08:44.680]  intelligence agencies to come in and overthrow president trump he's called the american people
[1:08:44.680 --> 1:08:49.400]  to overthrow trump he's put a lot of these videos out but his newest one is crazy i've been
[1:08:49.400 --> 1:08:53.880]  interrupting it quite a bit let me just play it somewhat uninterrupted and then let me write
[1:08:53.880 --> 1:08:58.520]  some notes about the full video it's up on info wars dot com keep oberman pleased with spied he's
[1:08:58.520 --> 1:09:04.760]  around the world to help him take down trump now you can work as an american non-violently to take
[1:09:04.760 --> 1:09:08.600]  down a president or anybody else you want but you can't work with foreign governments and groups
[1:09:08.600 --> 1:09:18.040]  are call on it the intent is illegal it's called espionage totally and completely illegal but it
[1:09:18.040 --> 1:09:22.360]  shows the desperateness and i've got more professors today you know saying kill trump and all this
[1:09:22.360 --> 1:09:27.880]  stuff and media people i mean this is a foaming at the mouth group of crazies here's keith oberman
[1:09:29.240 --> 1:09:35.160]  for gq this is what the corporations in america want this is the climate that they're putting
[1:09:35.160 --> 1:09:39.560]  out but but keith oberman it looks like a deer in the headlights as his whole identity that he's
[1:09:39.560 --> 1:09:44.920]  better than america you know he's wearing his west german news reporter outfit from the 1980s
[1:09:44.920 --> 1:09:49.320]  you know he's got his trendy colors of pink and blue behind him he's letting you know how cute
[1:09:49.320 --> 1:09:55.240]  and non-threatening he is but he wants war he wants to be in a man's world so let's go
[1:09:55.240 --> 1:10:00.840]  ahead and go to keith oberman here it is i'm keith oberman and this is the resistance i appeal to
[1:10:00.840 --> 1:10:06.760]  the intelligence agencies and the governments of what is left of the free world to them as entities
[1:10:06.760 --> 1:10:11.960]  entirities as bureaucracies making official decisions and to the individuals who make decisions of
[1:10:11.960 --> 1:10:20.840]  conscience to gchq and mi6 in the uk to the bnd in germany the dgse in france the asis in australia
[1:10:20.840 --> 1:10:25.720]  and even to the gru in russia where they must already be profoundly aware that they have not
[1:10:25.720 --> 1:10:32.360]  merely helped put an amoral cynic in power here but an uncontrollable one whose madness is genuine
[1:10:32.360 --> 1:10:37.880]  and whose usefulness even to them is at an end to all of them and to the world's journalists
[1:10:37.880 --> 1:10:44.200]  i make this plea we the citizens of the united states of america are the victims of a coup
[1:10:45.240 --> 1:10:49.720]  we need your leaks your information your intelligence your recordings your videos
[1:10:49.720 --> 1:10:54.840]  your conscience the civilian government and the military of the united states are no longer in
[1:10:54.840 --> 1:10:59.640]  the hands of the people nor in the control of any responsible individual i had paused i can't help
[1:10:59.640 --> 1:11:06.280]  it back in five seconds we had an election trumps restoring the republic he's restoring the
[1:11:06.280 --> 1:11:12.760]  constitution he's restoring jobs he's restoring sovereignty he fired the guy the democrats all
[1:11:12.760 --> 1:11:19.560]  called on to be fired comey and then oberman just says it's a coup that means it's unelected
[1:11:19.560 --> 1:11:27.560]  so he now wants foreign governments to overthrow that that's called a coup so total inversion of
[1:11:27.560 --> 1:11:34.280]  reality by this guy here it is who can rely the first step towards compromising our fbi occurred
[1:11:34.280 --> 1:11:39.800]  tuesday with the unilateral firing of its director by the president prompted by the attorney general
[1:11:39.800 --> 1:11:46.440]  both of whom are or were at least in theory possibly to be under investigation by the fbi
[1:11:46.440 --> 1:11:52.680]  as led by that director they fired our cia is run by one of that president's political appointees
[1:11:52.680 --> 1:11:57.400]  the first national security advisor was fired and may have been a russian stooge the second
[1:11:57.400 --> 1:12:01.880]  national security advisor has reportedly been yelled at by the president because he had had the
[1:12:01.880 --> 1:12:07.960]  temerity to disagree with him our state department is in the hands of useless amateurs our united
[1:12:07.960 --> 1:12:14.280]  nation's mission is bereft of power and uninformed hit pause again and the white hat rex tellison
[1:12:14.280 --> 1:12:19.800]  and if anything is compromised bringing in connalisa rise and is a global expert
[1:12:20.840 --> 1:12:27.960]  who's worked in over 160 countries so again that's more false statements pure bull out of a guy
[1:12:27.960 --> 1:12:33.160]  openly calling for foreign governments to overthrow our president this is naked treason
[1:12:33.160 --> 1:12:39.640]  and this arrogant slb thinks it's okay here it is run by a cabal of an amoral family syndicate
[1:12:39.640 --> 1:12:43.720]  that has spent its first three months slapping a dollar sign on anything that stood still long
[1:12:43.720 --> 1:12:49.880]  enough a cabal with at its head a man with seemingly no interest in our laws in our rights
[1:12:49.880 --> 1:12:57.640]  in our constitution and with a brain that appears to not work properly through our own negligence
[1:12:57.640 --> 1:13:02.680]  the resentment and stupidities of millions of us and the boundless greed of our elite class
[1:13:02.680 --> 1:13:09.160]  our democracy has all but slipped away from us it hangs today by a thread and those who could
[1:13:09.160 --> 1:13:13.960]  protect it and restore it and fight for it even at this late date the republican politicians
[1:13:13.960 --> 1:13:22.040]  whose voices today could force trump out of office tomorrow they are almost silent owned by special
[1:13:22.040 --> 1:13:29.720]  interests and silenced by a power again you back it up trump is the only president in 50 plus years
[1:13:29.720 --> 1:13:41.640]  who put pence in charge to get rid of all all of the special interest all of the lobbyist
[1:13:41.640 --> 1:13:47.720]  and to put bans on them and bans on whoever works for him being lobbyist for over a decade
[1:13:48.600 --> 1:13:54.200]  the special interests are almost unanimously against him goldman sacks gave all its money
[1:13:54.200 --> 1:14:00.760]  to hillary jayson morgan chase all its money some will argue well he's hired goldman sacks folks to
[1:14:00.760 --> 1:14:05.160]  run things because they know how to run things but they're following his orders and that's evident
[1:14:05.160 --> 1:14:10.360]  and what's happened in our economy so again oberman you are a liar it's you calling for the
[1:14:10.360 --> 1:14:14.920]  russians to overthrow the president he didn't have any aid from the russians it's pathetic what you
[1:14:14.920 --> 1:14:20.520]  claim back to oberman and those who could protect it and restore it and fight for it even at this
[1:14:20.520 --> 1:14:27.160]  late date the republican politicians whose voices today could force trump out of office tomorrow
[1:14:27.800 --> 1:14:34.200]  they are almost silent owned by special interests and silenced by a power that exceeds even whatever
[1:14:34.200 --> 1:14:39.880]  dedication to freedom they once had all but a few of them fall back into platitudes about the leader
[1:14:39.880 --> 1:14:45.720]  of the country firing the head of the fbi and precipitating a constitutional crisis in order
[1:14:45.720 --> 1:14:52.680]  to shut down the investigation of his possible high crimes okay let's hit pause again hey uh oberman
[1:14:53.960 --> 1:15:03.800]  every major democrat that goes on television or tweets from hillary clinton to her husband
[1:15:03.800 --> 1:15:10.600]  to nancy polosi to maxine waters to michael more all of them have come out and said get rid of
[1:15:10.600 --> 1:15:16.520]  comey he's horrible but now you claim that's not the case because you think your viewers
[1:15:16.520 --> 1:15:21.080]  are a bunch of idiots and the type of folks that go to gq to get their news and think they're smart
[1:15:21.080 --> 1:15:25.480]  to watch you read off the teleprompter the names of spy agencies like oh my gosh you're so smart
[1:15:25.480 --> 1:15:30.360]  and then every 30 seconds you look down at papers to imply you have notes and aren't reading
[1:15:30.360 --> 1:15:38.840]  off the teleprompter shows your total acting deception mr baby here it is majority party
[1:15:38.840 --> 1:15:43.560]  infinitely rings its hands about timing and how troubled they are and then they go back to
[1:15:43.560 --> 1:15:48.680]  calculating how they will most easily get reelected with well let's hit pause again i agree that a lot
[1:15:48.680 --> 1:15:52.600]  of republicans are a bunch of hand-wringing blue blood scum that we're going to remove from office
[1:15:52.600 --> 1:15:58.280]  through the ballot box dumbo not through martial law or civil insurrection or foreign powers and
[1:15:58.280 --> 1:16:02.600]  coup d'etats that you're calling for while you claim we've done that we've got people running
[1:16:02.600 --> 1:16:08.760]  for office everywhere winning promoting prosperity the second amendment defending christian's rights
[1:16:08.760 --> 1:16:13.880]  defending our republic and you don't like it your time of kicking christians around and having
[1:16:13.880 --> 1:16:18.200]  deals with the islamicists to have their way and sexually mutilate women and put a jibs on little
[1:16:18.200 --> 1:16:23.640]  girls heads and teach islam in the schools are over you leftist trash who hated christianity so

[1:16:34.440 --> 1:16:41.480]  with a ball gag in our mouth americans aren't into bondage boy and we're not going to be enslaved
[1:16:41.480 --> 1:16:49.080]  by east coast fop fake pseudo-intellectual pieces of garbage reading off teleprompters do you

[1:18:12.520 --> 1:18:18.760]  of america are victims of a coup for months we have heard that your organizations have damning
[1:18:18.760 --> 1:18:24.760]  evidence against donald john trump whatever evidence you may have you cannot conceal it any
[1:18:24.760 --> 1:18:31.560]  long oh no whatever we in this country are to you now for months we've heard from liars like you

[1:18:36.920 --> 1:18:43.320]  about winning and all about never letting himself get any trouble and being upright all he does is
[1:18:43.320 --> 1:18:49.080]  eat sweets two scoops of ice cream and a piece of cake every night that's what he does no alcohol
[1:18:49.640 --> 1:18:55.640]  no drugs no cigarettes no nothing everybody knows that's why he's so successful and so healthy

[1:19:40.520 --> 1:19:46.120]  live in flyover territory isn't that right mr oberman let's go back to your lies wherever you
[1:19:46.120 --> 1:19:51.800]  are now you know that this nation has been a savior to you at some point in the past oh

[1:21:08.680 --> 1:21:14.200]  canceling their tv shows all your insanity and then you point your finger at us with pure projection
[1:21:14.200 --> 1:21:19.000]  and then say that we are the insane ones let's go back to keith oberman who when he was in msnbc
[1:21:19.000 --> 1:21:24.440]  they called him bathtub boy because he demanded a bathtub in his uh in his dressing room and he
[1:21:24.440 --> 1:21:31.640]  would lock the door and sit in the bathtub for hours that that is a fact bathtub boy little spoiled
[1:21:31.640 --> 1:21:36.600]  rotten sports caster that knows everything is now i'm going to sit up here in like a general
[1:21:36.600 --> 1:21:40.440]  and call for foreign forces to overthrow our president while he claims that we're the coup

[1:21:47.720 --> 1:21:53.560]  now we need your help oh hit pause again he talks to us like we're two years old and real slow he
[1:21:53.560 --> 1:21:56.680]  looks down because he's reading a teleprompter let me act like i'm not looking at a teleprompter
[1:21:57.400 --> 1:22:02.120]  now we need i i wrote this myself i'm keith oberman of course he didn't let me act like i wrote it
[1:22:02.120 --> 1:22:06.680]  oh i'm let me go back to my heart faultness because i'm reading off teleprompter um oh yeah
[1:22:06.680 --> 1:22:11.720]  can we show the camera here it was a teleprompter here okay yeah let's see the teleprompter now now
[1:22:11.720 --> 1:22:18.440]  see mr fake intellectual um let's back him up 10 seconds because this is a key part right here
[1:22:18.440 --> 1:22:24.040]  he says the world's in danger because of us it was the clinton's gave nuclear reactors in north korea
[1:22:24.040 --> 1:22:27.880]  it was the liberal elites that gave a communist chinese nuclear weapons back in the 60s
[1:22:29.480 --> 1:22:33.000]  and it's been our elites that have been destabilizing the world forever and now
[1:22:33.000 --> 1:22:37.800]  trump wants to end all that with common sense and pragmatism and you don't like it so you
[1:22:37.800 --> 1:22:43.880]  claim the world's in danger because of him let's continue that is at least sane is your surest
[1:22:43.880 --> 1:22:49.320]  guarantee of a prosperous future indeed it was perhaps yeah let's look at pence speaking to
[1:22:49.320 --> 1:22:54.200]  a large christian group admitting that there's a genocide of christians 200 000 a year uh it's
[1:22:54.200 --> 1:22:58.680]  more than double the last decade by muslims against christians and so now the president and the
[1:22:58.680 --> 1:23:03.480]  vice president are talking about how christians are being persecuted all over the world while
[1:23:03.480 --> 1:23:09.160]  muslims promote killing all the jews in copenhagen denmark and don't get in trouble that's today
[1:23:09.160 --> 1:23:14.360]  and twitter says telling the truth about refugee crisis is hateful conduct don't point out that
[1:23:14.360 --> 1:23:19.400]  80 plus percent are military age men or you'll be arrested in europe because that's hate speech
[1:23:20.040 --> 1:23:25.800]  that's not scary oh i'm sorry let's go back to keith overman here it goes perhaps your surest
[1:23:25.800 --> 1:23:31.880]  guarantee of any future at all so you have no pause again i'm sorry so so there's no future at all
[1:23:31.880 --> 1:23:37.800]  unless you believe algor and bill sine the science guy bill nye saves the earth algor saves the earth
[1:23:37.800 --> 1:23:42.840]  polar bears can't swim the ice caps have all melted the sea levels up 100 feet we're all dead
[1:23:42.840 --> 1:23:50.440]  sea levels down it's all lies lies lies by another fake sitting up there in a little costume trying
[1:23:50.440 --> 1:23:58.200]  to look intellectual reading off a teleprompter let's go back now we need your help whatever there
[1:23:58.200 --> 1:24:06.200]  is on trump reveal it issue it officially if you can leak it but it was again whatever it is
[1:24:06.200 --> 1:24:10.920]  because it's all made up whatever it is maybe he's santa claus maybe he's really george washington
[1:24:10.920 --> 1:24:15.720]  maybe he's a space alien maybe he's one of keith overman's hemorrhoids i mean just whatever it is
[1:24:15.720 --> 1:24:21.160]  you've got we all made stuff up and said there was something so it must be true we all read the
[1:24:21.160 --> 1:24:26.440]  secret we believe we can manifest of course you can't it's all made up but let's just manifest
[1:24:26.440 --> 1:24:31.560]  it's crumps gone how about we manifest the keep overman doesn't just read off teleprompters back
[1:24:31.560 --> 1:24:36.920]  to him if you're directors and your governments want you to wait look to the last days here and
[1:24:36.920 --> 1:24:42.920]  ask yourselves plumb your consciences if there is any it was left he didn't want to say we're in the
[1:24:42.920 --> 1:24:49.800]  last day so he says he's an atheist here in the last days plumb your conscience go to the depths
[1:24:49.800 --> 1:24:54.680]  of it do the right thing go against your own government leak the information about trump let's
[1:24:54.680 --> 1:25:01.800]  continue to wait give it to a reporter give it to an american friend put it on the internet leave it
[1:25:01.800 --> 1:25:07.880]  outside somebody's backdoor there is no time left for protocols and estimations of long-term impacts
[1:25:07.880 --> 1:25:14.920]  and tradecraft a dictator in training has betrayed our constitution and nevertheless survived two
[1:25:14.920 --> 1:25:21.480]  nights in office the dictatorship he may want the dictatorship he may feel is the natural extension
[1:25:21.480 --> 1:25:28.040]  of his past life the dictatorship he may believe he has earned has gone in this week from crawling
[1:25:28.600 --> 1:25:36.600]  to taking its first few tentative steps what you have we need a pause and now what foreign
[1:25:36.600 --> 1:25:43.560]  governments have we need please overthrow our government so oh trump does what the democrats
[1:25:43.560 --> 1:25:47.720]  asked for in fires comey who's all over the map there's badmouthing the president calling him crazy
[1:25:47.720 --> 1:25:54.520]  on the nose and bill clinton fires the fbi director the day before they kill vince foster and but
[1:25:54.520 --> 1:26:00.040]  that's okay and the president supposed to be the person in charge of that but now it's the end of
[1:26:00.040 --> 1:26:05.000]  the world again this is all misrepresentation like groober said hoping you're stupid hoping you have
[1:26:05.000 --> 1:26:15.640]  no memory we need it now and to the intelligence community of this country your patriotic duty
[1:26:15.640 --> 1:26:20.040]  is clear in many respects in the months since the election you have provided your greatest
[1:26:20.040 --> 1:26:26.600]  service in our history a democracy that has lost its political way staggers down the street like a
[1:26:26.600 --> 1:26:32.920]  drunk and lurches towards the gutter yet you have walked a virtually bipartisan straight line
[1:26:32.920 --> 1:26:39.000]  and you have followed your rules and you have followed the rules of the civilians and yet
[1:26:39.000 --> 1:26:44.680]  the evil doers still exist regardless the evil doers threat to the freedoms of this nation
[1:26:44.680 --> 1:26:50.920]  that this nation has ever faced the trump administration the trump junta is playing by no
[1:26:50.920 --> 1:26:58.360]  rules deposit and just the trump junta and the whole world's in danger and only this guy
[1:27:00.280 --> 1:27:06.840]  only this guy can save everybody this is just over the top craziness and then trump responds
[1:27:06.840 --> 1:27:11.320]  nicely back to all this that they're fake news that they're out to get him and they're the enemy
[1:27:11.320 --> 1:27:15.400]  and they freak out and go we just want you dead or overthrown or foreign governments to overthrow
[1:27:15.400 --> 1:27:19.480]  you we're just saying you're the devil we're just saying you're a dictator how dare you not come to
[1:27:19.480 --> 1:27:24.440]  our press dinner how dare you not let us lie about you what's your problem we're supposed to be in
[1:27:24.440 --> 1:27:31.640]  charge and no one's supposed to resist us off the fbi director and let him find out about it
[1:27:32.200 --> 1:27:36.440]  by reading a tv news crawl in the back of the room in which he was addressing his los angeles
[1:27:36.440 --> 1:27:44.680]  office they have no rules for now the rest of us who only want our democracy back we can have no
[1:27:44.680 --> 1:27:51.800]  rules either we will take the risk of reestablishing the rules later on what you and the fbi in the
[1:27:51.800 --> 1:28:02.200]  cia in the justice department have on trump we also need now because by tomorrow it may disappear
[1:28:02.200 --> 1:28:09.640]  and your ability to do anything with it may disappear as well some of us here in the outside
[1:28:09.640 --> 1:28:15.240]  have tried the best we could to prevent this day others less so right now it doesn't matter
[1:28:15.240 --> 1:28:20.360]  i mean it's so hard to listen to this guy i apologize for even playing it but this is a mindset
[1:28:20.360 --> 1:28:26.680]  into these people they've done everything they claim trump's doing they have sat there and assaulted
[1:28:26.680 --> 1:28:31.880]  this country tried to demonize it tried to pull it down tried to take our freedoms shipped our jobs
[1:28:31.880 --> 1:28:37.560]  overseas written books about how they've done it they have celebrated and celebrated and celebrated
[1:28:37.560 --> 1:28:43.160]  that they the globalist they the leftist they the communist they the sorosists they the nazi
[1:28:43.160 --> 1:28:49.560]  collaborators have control of our churches our kids minds the fda they can brainwash us they can

[1:28:55.640 --> 1:29:02.440]  institutions steal our money perch on top of us and then put always the same guys like steven cobert
[1:29:02.440 --> 1:29:07.800]  and oberman and all of them the the pseudo intellectual little suits little nerd man
[1:29:07.800 --> 1:29:15.320]  non-threatening you know bean counter brain bug know-it-all good boy teachers pet psychopath
[1:29:15.320 --> 1:29:21.240]  outfits you know ted bundy the famous psychopath dressed in gray suits with black ties and white
[1:29:21.240 --> 1:29:26.600]  shirts with glasses just like that even though he didn't need them because he'd drive around
[1:29:26.600 --> 1:29:31.720]  non-threatening picking up young college girls and high school girls to torture him to death
[1:29:31.720 --> 1:29:36.600]  that's a psychopath outfit they wear to look non-threatening i'm not saying he's going to
[1:29:36.600 --> 1:29:41.240]  kidnap your kids and kill him he wants to kidnap your country and strangle it to death while he
[1:29:41.240 --> 1:29:46.920]  tells you you deserve it that's keep over but he thinks he's better than you he thinks he's
[1:29:46.920 --> 1:29:51.800]  beaten you and he realizes he's losing and has now been kicked to the curb and he's panicking
[1:29:51.800 --> 1:29:56.840]  empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network
[1:30:00.920 --> 1:30:07.480]  so today i want to talk about killing white people in context a texas a and m professor says
[1:30:07.480 --> 1:30:15.880]  that some white people may have to die in order to solve racism and bring about true equality
[1:30:15.880 --> 1:30:19.880]  when we have this conversation about violence or killing white people it has to be looked at in
[1:30:19.880 --> 1:30:23.800]  this kind of this historical term and the fact that we've had no one address like how relevant
[1:30:23.800 --> 1:30:29.000]  and how solidified this kind of tradition is for black people saying look in order to be equal in
[1:30:29.000 --> 1:30:34.280]  order to be liberated some white people may have to die that was professor tommy curry on the writing
[1:30:34.280 --> 1:30:41.240]  news review podcast who went on to say that the movie jango unchained made killing white people
[1:30:41.240 --> 1:30:48.840]  look fun but in reality it should be part of a serious discussion so far it is unknown if law
[1:30:48.840 --> 1:30:55.640]  enforcement officials or homeland security are investigating tommy curry for his violent racist
[1:30:55.640 --> 1:31:01.640]  and terroristic threats and you can learn more right now at info wars dot com it's not just our

[1:38:28.600 --> 1:38:33.240]  frame just to trigger people that are anti-free speech look trump's far from perfect i don't
[1:38:33.240 --> 1:38:37.000]  like him talking about going after a saunge i don't like you know some of the things he's
[1:38:37.000 --> 1:38:42.840]  been doing but overall three trillion in new jobs three trillion the stock market 300 billion in new
[1:38:42.840 --> 1:38:48.600]  jobs half a million new jobs already aluminum steel investigations into illegals voting and
[1:38:48.600 --> 1:38:55.320]  dead people voting people voting in their names cutting the un funding by half uh 43
[1:38:55.320 --> 1:38:59.480]  percent down on the illegals coming across the border according to ice i mean it goes on and on
[1:38:59.480 --> 1:39:05.240]  and on killing tpp and that's why the special interests of the elites are so mad at trump the
[1:39:05.240 --> 1:39:11.320]  first 70 days he was pretty much a hundred percent on then the last i don't know 50 or so he started
[1:39:11.320 --> 1:39:16.040]  going a little bit sideways and now he's learned the system isn't compromising they take that as
[1:39:16.040 --> 1:39:21.720]  weakness so i got word from the wine house over the weekend and i told you this the gloves are
[1:39:21.720 --> 1:39:27.640]  coming off trump is going to get really aggressive now he's not going to just roll over like other
[1:39:27.640 --> 1:39:32.680]  people that they've basically ganged up on like a pack of hyenas on a lion trump is going to go
[1:39:32.680 --> 1:39:37.560]  after these people now because they are calling for his death they're calling for his overthrow
[1:39:37.560 --> 1:39:41.080]  they're calling for our overthrow they're calling for me to be shut down they're all over the news
[1:39:41.080 --> 1:39:47.160]  saying it's a war they mean business ladies and gentlemen and so all of us have to go into high
[1:39:47.160 --> 1:39:52.920]  gear now to defend this republic now i know pacenic has been supportive of trump pointed
[1:39:52.920 --> 1:39:56.360]  out that a lot of the patriots and intelligence agencies actually helped trump get in but they
[1:39:56.360 --> 1:40:01.960]  didn't vote to get neocons in and he has reigned in mcmaster and others so he had been on a few weeks
[1:40:01.960 --> 1:40:05.800]  we'll find out what his latest intel is on this he disagrees with trump he'll tell us we don't
[1:40:05.800 --> 1:40:10.440]  pre you know do these interviews and but you don't have to agree with me i don't actually know his
[1:40:10.440 --> 1:40:16.120]  view on this up to the minute i just know this who can deny the establishment is is not after trump
[1:40:16.120 --> 1:40:20.840]  who deny that keith oberman is calling for foreign agencies to come here and help overthrowing that
[1:40:20.840 --> 1:40:27.880]  is totally illegal and who can deny uh that comey was operating as his own operative not
[1:40:27.880 --> 1:40:33.640]  investigating the leaks not investigating susan rice i mean this is just a crazy time to be alive so
[1:40:33.640 --> 1:40:37.800]  dr pacenic of steve pacenic dot com you've heard my rant here uh what do you think about
[1:40:37.800 --> 1:40:42.200]  what's currently happening with comey and the desperateness of the so-called left just everywhere
[1:40:42.200 --> 1:40:47.240]  saying kill me kill trump kill everybody i mean they just seem so emboldened looking for a fight
[1:40:48.280 --> 1:40:54.600]  well let me put it this way keith oberman really paid you one of the highest compliments i have
[1:40:54.600 --> 1:41:01.160]  ever seen helix because keith himself has no substance he's never had a history of substance
[1:41:01.160 --> 1:41:05.560]  he knows very little about our national security certainly doesn't know anything about our
[1:41:05.560 --> 1:41:12.360]  intelligence never served our country but if you look at his modality his modus operandi
[1:41:12.360 --> 1:41:18.280]  he is trying to ape you but he can't do it very well in other words it was one of the issues you
[1:41:18.280 --> 1:41:24.520]  and i talked about many years ago that the left will come in and try to aid what happened with
[1:41:24.520 --> 1:41:29.560]  myself with the intelligence community and with you and the alternative rights so what you're
[1:41:29.560 --> 1:41:37.560]  seeing now is literally a very fuzzy mirror image of what we had done but it doesn't work anymore
[1:41:37.560 --> 1:41:43.080]  now keith i don't know i'm i'm sure he's a nice guy he went to the same school i went to cornell
[1:41:43.080 --> 1:41:50.440]  he said he's pompous he's bombastic he was thrown off of adams nbc bill riley had problems with him
[1:41:51.640 --> 1:41:57.160]  al gore had problems with him so the left has always had problems with keith he has no substance
[1:41:57.160 --> 1:42:04.600]  he's basically a sports broadcaster and you may or may not know this but he had hit his head against
[1:42:04.600 --> 1:42:10.600]  a subway door and may have had a concussion so i looked at him as a farce this this is not a
[1:42:10.600 --> 1:42:17.960]  serious character gq knows that uh pretty much our intelligence system knows that remember in order
[1:42:17.960 --> 1:42:25.320]  to have credibility in what you and i do you have to have had served our country one way or the other
[1:42:25.320 --> 1:42:33.000]  in your case it has been the consistency and the fortitude to remain what in your place and what
[1:42:33.000 --> 1:42:39.320]  you have done for 20 years i i'm not you know blind sunshine here i'm just telling you why it is
[1:42:39.320 --> 1:42:47.320]  that they're having a very hard time trying to displace you me or even trump the issue of comey
[1:42:47.320 --> 1:42:53.240]  is correct i mean trump is correctly said he's a show voter he's he's a narcissist i mean when he
[1:42:53.240 --> 1:42:59.880]  stood up there and said i can't convict uh hillary but here are the 30 000 reasons why she should be
[1:42:59.880 --> 1:43:07.720]  guilty that was absurd the reality is that president can and should fire anybody i had no problem that
[1:43:07.720 --> 1:43:14.280]  comey was fired i had no problem that fbi has to be reorganized they've been a faulty organization
[1:43:14.280 --> 1:43:19.800]  for many many years you and i have talked about it they need somebody in there who can clean them out
[1:43:19.800 --> 1:43:27.160]  and dismiss a lot of people because the future isn't about you know gumshoe uh the investigation
[1:43:27.160 --> 1:43:33.320]  it's going to be about cyber command cyber control even on the domestic level and the fbi is nowhere
[1:43:33.320 --> 1:43:39.880]  near the capacity it should be that's why mark rogers of the nsa would be a good leader or
[1:43:39.880 --> 1:43:45.640]  someone else in cyber command should take over the fbi and reorganize it because it's been the
[1:43:45.640 --> 1:43:53.240]  gumshoe industry now i will quote to you something that a very famous fbi agent said and this is
[1:43:53.240 --> 1:44:00.680]  the following he said once we collect intelligence and then we are ordered to implement some type
[1:44:00.680 --> 1:44:09.160]  of policy we have become a gestapo agency and who said that jade gohoover and comey didn't listen
[1:44:09.160 --> 1:44:15.560]  Mueller didn't listen a whole bunch of the fbi directors free didn't listen it was jade gohoover
[1:44:15.560 --> 1:44:21.880]  who warned that the minute we collect intelligence and we are asked to implement or manipulate it
[1:44:21.880 --> 1:44:29.000]  we become a gestapo agency that's jade gohoover so the issue of trump i would agree with roger
[1:44:29.000 --> 1:44:34.200]  stone there's leakage and we said it from day one it's coming out of the white house you have
[1:44:34.200 --> 1:44:40.200]  goman sacks boys you have jared kushner and you have mcmaster the the issue that came out
[1:44:40.200 --> 1:44:47.400]  for you and me was what i said a while ago is that the triumphant or the triad you a bill
[1:44:47.400 --> 1:44:54.120]  riley steve bannon were kind of taken offline but only temporarily and what's happened is they
[1:44:54.120 --> 1:44:59.800]  could not assess your endurance or the fact that steve bannon would remain there or the fact that
[1:44:59.800 --> 1:45:06.200]  fox and others like myself would remain in the alternative right to keep on saying you know
[1:45:06.200 --> 1:45:11.960]  there's the truth here's a man who's implementing exactly what he's doing and by the way he correctly
[1:45:11.960 --> 1:45:17.240]  says you know what we don't need a press conference i've said that from day one say that for years
[1:45:17.240 --> 1:45:22.600]  just get rid of it give them a statement because they only distort what he says there is no entitlement
[1:45:22.600 --> 1:45:28.760]  for journalists to be in the white house to be anywhere it was a use and it was an intercession
[1:45:28.760 --> 1:45:33.240]  when we didn't have the internet we don't need journalists to tell me what to do you don't
[1:45:33.240 --> 1:45:38.760]  need a journalist to tell you what happened you just need 1600 daily which is the white house
[1:45:40.440 --> 1:45:45.160]  statement of the day and if you read it he's protecting christians this is what they're doing
[1:45:45.160 --> 1:45:51.000]  in in one state this is what they're doing overseas and they give you a very clear agenda
[1:45:51.000 --> 1:45:58.520]  when you put a group of people whose basic history has been to be sycophants remember the basis of
[1:45:58.520 --> 1:46:05.000]  journalism is to pander once you have pandering within an individual or a group it doesn't matter
[1:46:05.000 --> 1:46:09.880]  whether you're new york times or the washington they're compromised they're compromised so from
[1:46:09.880 --> 1:46:17.240]  day one at my bill at my background used to be in disinformation a journalist would call me up
[1:46:17.240 --> 1:46:23.000]  i never forgot it or one of the regime changes i had i told him exactly what he wanted to hear
[1:46:23.000 --> 1:46:28.120]  and then ten years later i contradicted him because that was the ability for me to manipulate the
[1:46:28.120 --> 1:46:34.280]  press the press is just an entity very easily manipulated they don't have jobs they can't
[1:46:34.280 --> 1:46:38.200]  convert and they're becoming more and more obsolete because in an internet world people
[1:46:38.200 --> 1:46:41.960]  independently can fact check them there's all these other forms of information that give people
[1:46:41.960 --> 1:46:46.040]  a much clearer view so it shows how antiquated and ridiculous they are but expanding on this
[1:46:46.040 --> 1:46:51.800]  comey saying and then leaking it that he thought trump was crazy to say obama was spying on him
[1:46:51.800 --> 1:46:56.840]  it's now come out that obama did order thousands of people during the campaign spied on the new
[1:46:56.840 --> 1:47:00.920]  york times previously bragged that they were spying on trump so they're they're acting like
[1:47:00.920 --> 1:47:07.000]  there's no memory there and they're following this gruber precept that that that they're
[1:47:07.000 --> 1:47:11.720]  operating in a vacuum and nobody knows what they're doing sure a large part of the public
[1:47:11.720 --> 1:47:16.360]  has no memory but the actual people involved working in the country know they're a discredited
[1:47:16.360 --> 1:47:21.640]  pack of liars so they get more and more crazy more and more aggressive more and more out of control
[1:47:21.640 --> 1:47:27.640]  in their attempt to defeat the re-assurgence of a new american system and they seem to be in total
[1:47:27.640 --> 1:47:34.520]  panic mode uh i just like you to respond to the attempt by comey to say the president was crazy
[1:47:34.520 --> 1:47:40.280]  to say he was being spied on as president-elect i mean that's an absolute fact well that's not
[1:47:40.280 --> 1:47:46.520]  the issue the issue is comey from day one i wrote a blog which i had sent to you but it was on my
[1:47:46.520 --> 1:47:55.160]  blog site in december of 2015 saying that the entire election will depend on comey and we were right
[1:47:55.880 --> 1:48:02.200]  but what i didn't add and i added it afterwards was hillary's downfall was not just her own
[1:48:02.200 --> 1:48:09.480]  incompetence and incompetence of the left it was one individual who i have tracked for 20 to 30 years
[1:48:09.480 --> 1:48:16.840]  and i knew he would never fail to undermine hillary and that individual's name bill clinton
[1:48:16.840 --> 1:48:23.400]  oh yeah the day he walked over to loretta lynch i said right on brother you just screwed your wife
[1:48:23.400 --> 1:48:30.520]  for the 30th time in your entire career the minute he walked into loretta lynch i knew comey would
[1:48:30.520 --> 1:48:36.360]  have to address this issue because that was his boss and you and i talked about it i said she will
[1:48:36.360 --> 1:48:43.640]  go down comey will go down the clinton's will go down that was the key moment i was waiting for
[1:48:43.640 --> 1:48:47.320]  so let's expand on this why do you think that as you said this basically that trump's right to do
[1:48:47.320 --> 1:48:53.480]  this the democrats all wanting fired he shows he he does weird things uh i mean he admitted hillary
[1:48:53.480 --> 1:48:58.200]  was a criminal but then said but i can't do anything that's even worse to admit she's a criminal but
[1:48:58.200 --> 1:49:03.320]  then say i can't get prosecutors to do it but basically saying the whole system's corrupt and
[1:49:03.320 --> 1:49:09.320]  they're not showing any courage i think comey overall was just a very very weak person comey
[1:49:09.320 --> 1:49:15.320]  was a pander i mean he came out of the major law firm in washington dc where he worked with a lot of
[1:49:15.320 --> 1:49:19.960]  the other lawyers who had worked for hillary clinton i've talked about it this is part of the
[1:49:19.960 --> 1:49:25.560]  washington set so what comey is going to do right after this and showboating he's going to go to one
[1:49:25.560 --> 1:49:32.440]  of the publishers or he's going to go to benet who's a very good agent uh a benet his lawyer in
[1:49:32.440 --> 1:49:38.920]  washington dc he has the clinton's he has chain he will get a huge book contract for millions of
[1:49:38.920 --> 1:49:45.560]  dollars and that's the end of comey the reality is the fbi has been an organization that's been out
[1:49:45.560 --> 1:49:51.880]  of control for a long time remember what happened in the boston bombing what happened with the uh
[1:49:51.880 --> 1:49:58.280]  muslim psychiatrist who basically threatened to kill people in fort hood the fbi had information
[1:49:58.280 --> 1:50:04.440]  on it they never acted on it what they need is a cleansing like the cia now why didn't they act for
[1:50:04.440 --> 1:50:07.720]  two years when that guy was emailing people and telling folks he was going to kill about your
[1:50:07.720 --> 1:50:15.320]  people they didn't do anything why because they're incompetent the the ability to do something like you
[1:50:15.320 --> 1:50:22.360]  and i is a very simple issue you like many people on the alternative right you and i it's not that
[1:50:22.360 --> 1:50:28.680]  we're smarter it's that we're willing to take calculated risks when nobody is in the arena
[1:50:28.680 --> 1:50:34.200]  and when i mean calculated risks look in principle you should have been thrown out of this business
[1:50:34.840 --> 1:50:40.920]  because of the of a the entire problem that you had with your divorce and all that but you didn't
[1:50:40.920 --> 1:50:46.280]  you came back even stronger and that's what we were counting on and the same thing with you
[1:50:46.280 --> 1:50:50.680]  same thing oh yeah they're gonna run a scythe the worst things get the stronger i get and and
[1:50:50.680 --> 1:50:54.120]  the more my listeners support us well let's flesh that on the other side they're certainly
[1:50:54.120 --> 1:50:57.480]  trying to take us out though and i'm not saying they may not hit us with something they're successful
[1:50:57.480 --> 1:51:03.240]  but in the end the message will still get out in these uncertain times it makes sense to have a
[1:51:03.240 --> 1:51:07.880]  sustainable backup method to cook food and boil water if your current plan includes using a fuel

[1:53:58.920 --> 1:54:05.480]  Dr. C. Pachennick's our guest a little bit in the next hour that I promise I'm opening the
[1:54:05.480 --> 1:54:09.080]  phones up taking a lot of your calls and getting into some of the world news we haven't gotten to
[1:54:09.080 --> 1:54:13.080]  what we've been focused on coming I know this though there's this arrogance by the bureaucracy
[1:54:13.080 --> 1:54:18.440]  that Dr. Pachennick talks about who was in Washington for a long time there's an entitlement
[1:54:18.440 --> 1:54:23.720]  that you see in any group out there and I don't claim to have all the answers I fundamentally
[1:54:23.720 --> 1:54:28.600]  believe in free market capitalism I know it produces incredible wealth incredible freedom
[1:54:28.600 --> 1:54:33.960]  compared to collectivism whether it be fascists or socialists or communists so I really believe
[1:54:33.960 --> 1:54:39.640]  in what I believe in and all these special interests they just can't believe that I actually stand for
[1:54:39.640 --> 1:54:43.640]  what I believe in they want to make their money through crony groups through inside groups through
[1:54:43.640 --> 1:54:48.760]  government contracts or through government payroll and they offered me three million dollars to sell
[1:54:48.760 --> 1:54:52.760]  out ten million dollars to sell out that was a long time ago now we bring in way more money than
[1:54:52.760 --> 1:54:58.200]  that to build this organization money's not a bad thing it's just that I want to defeat them
[1:54:58.200 --> 1:55:05.320]  I really believe in Team America and then they are always calling us traders we're being funded by
[1:55:05.320 --> 1:55:11.000]  foreign groups I'm funded by you the listeners buying products that's how I have 70 employees and
[1:55:11.000 --> 1:55:17.400]  new reporters and we're doing the work of a lot of other organizations out there that are just too
[1:55:17.400 --> 1:55:23.720]  lazy or too afraid so many people are afraid to be criticized by MSM I love it they're a bunch of
[1:55:23.720 --> 1:55:29.000]  scum if they want to call me names and say lies about me and say I'm racist or make up a bunch
[1:55:29.000 --> 1:55:33.320]  of crap I don't care they're going back to Dr. C. Pachennick I'm not trying to lionize myself
[1:55:33.320 --> 1:55:39.320]  he's bringing it up as a model they've hit us with everything they've got so far and it's only
[1:55:39.320 --> 1:55:43.560]  made the listeners support us more and buy more of our products and spread the word more because
[1:55:43.560 --> 1:55:47.880]  they see the censorship they see the admissions now they're maybe at some point where we buckle
[1:55:47.880 --> 1:55:52.600]  and collapse I hope it's not the case but there's already so many other people now doing what we
[1:55:52.600 --> 1:55:57.400]  do and what Dr. Pachennick does that the establishment really needs to see the writing on the wall
[1:55:58.200 --> 1:56:03.640]  that trumps only a manifestation of nationalism and I don't really see where they're going to
[1:56:03.640 --> 1:56:08.920]  put the genie back in the bottle and I'm not trying to give people a pep talk here I really
[1:56:08.920 --> 1:56:13.560]  truly have studied history and I've studied the current trends and I believe if our listeners
[1:56:13.560 --> 1:56:17.720]  just continue to take action and continue to spread the word and continue to work hard and
[1:56:17.720 --> 1:56:25.000]  promote basic common sense worldwide we are going to enter a golden era of human productivity in the
[1:56:25.000 --> 1:56:29.240]  future if we don't though we're going to enter a new dark age Dr. Pachennick what do you think and
[1:56:29.240 --> 1:56:33.160]  other comments about Trump so far because I know he did pretty good for a while kind of went sideways
[1:56:33.160 --> 1:56:37.320]  you got concerned sounds like you're thinking he's getting back on track that's what I've heard from
[1:56:37.320 --> 1:56:42.840]  the White House is that he he's going to really get back on track now well I think what he's doing
[1:56:42.840 --> 1:56:49.480]  now and is about to do is absolutely correct number one you fire ad hoc and immediately told me
[1:56:49.480 --> 1:56:56.600]  should have been fired from day one number two Trump doesn't have to justify anything and secondly I
[1:56:56.600 --> 1:57:01.000]  would get rid of the press corps on every plane ride I would get rid of the press corps in the
[1:57:01.000 --> 1:57:07.800]  White House they're absolutely of no value to the republic thirdly he has people who are loyal to
[1:57:07.800 --> 1:57:12.760]  him but are loyal to the republic we're talking about the generals we're talking about the intelligence
[1:57:12.760 --> 1:57:20.280]  industry now he has to start putting into place the infrastructure issue one of the things that
[1:57:20.280 --> 1:57:25.480]  I'm most concerned about even though our economy went up is that we don't stagnate on growth we
[1:57:25.480 --> 1:57:32.040]  have to have a greater growth than two percent GDP and one of the reasons for that is that allows
[1:57:32.040 --> 1:57:39.240]  it will justify the Trump approach to the republic and once we can grow even more so than Europe
[1:57:39.240 --> 1:57:46.040]  which is going to fail now because of my tone who's a young kid you know they they want this young
[1:57:46.040 --> 1:57:52.600]  kid who's been in politics and basically is a euro specialist they're not going to go anywhere
[1:57:52.600 --> 1:57:57.480]  so America becomes even more powerful we don't have to get into conflict with north korea
[1:57:57.480 --> 1:58:01.400]  stay there and break that down but since you mentioned that and I totally agree Trump's trying
[1:58:01.400 --> 1:58:06.360]  to boost economy while all these other influences show it going down so we're really in a flux right
[1:58:06.360 --> 1:58:10.280]  now where everybody should be rooting for the economy but they're not do you agree with that
[1:58:10.280 --> 1:58:16.440]  statement yeah basically I think Trump has to keep his eye on the ball the ball is the infrastructure
[1:58:16.440 --> 1:58:21.480]  that's why he's brought in mnuchin that's why he's been brought in uh ross that's why he's been
[1:58:21.480 --> 1:58:24.600]  much what he keeps telling reporters he keeps saying listen it's the economy stay there I want
[1:58:24.600 --> 1:58:29.720]  to come back there and ask you what you think we should do on the economy but also about micron
[1:58:29.720 --> 1:58:34.040]  because it's pretty much admitted the news that he's been compromised since a very young age
[1:58:34.040 --> 1:58:40.040]  and there's you know reports about sex operative stuff that we may have a true manchurian candidate
[1:58:40.040 --> 1:58:44.040]  as the new french president we'll be right back you know with his 65-year-old wife and
[1:58:44.600 --> 1:58:47.880]  all the rest the weirdness who reportedly had sex with him when he was a teenager
[1:58:47.880 --> 1:58:53.480]  and then he's a Rothschild banker I mean who can make this up today we call it bone broth and for
[1:58:53.480 --> 1:58:58.120]  thousands of years our ancestors enjoyed its benefits before it became a loss to our modern
[1:58:58.120 --> 1:59:03.960]  diet a processed junk we are now introducing caveman by infowarslife.com the ultimate in true

[1:59:10.360 --> 1:59:15.720]  in a single great tasting formula caveman it's those people living in the wilds having to actually
[1:59:15.720 --> 1:59:20.600]  build civilization that are our superior ancestors and we need to do everything we can to recapture
[1:59:20.600 --> 1:59:25.640]  that everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal you used the meat for sustenance the
[1:59:25.640 --> 1:59:31.640]  fat for cooking but you use the bones for strength from the outside structure full of minerals and
[1:59:31.640 --> 1:59:37.320]  kiko factors to the marrow that produces the blood for the body this is the engine of the life essence
[1:59:37.320 --> 1:59:42.280]  I'm a long way from the caveman my ancestors were but I'm sure as hell trying to get back to that
[1:59:42.280 --> 1:59:46.200]  essence that made us what we were and this is a big part of it I know you're going to want to check
[1:59:46.200 --> 1:59:55.400]  out caveman ultimate paleo formula for yourself infowarslife.com today you're listening to the alex
[1:59:55.400 --> 2:00:21.080]  jones show oh my gosh rallying patriots worldwide I'm exhausted now of human liberty you're listening
[2:00:21.080 --> 2:00:27.800]  to the alex jones show I apologize for subjecting you to 30 minutes of me yelling at chief oberman
[2:00:28.440 --> 2:00:36.680]  I just he's so fake he's so phony he's so full of garbage and then I look at the horrible establishment
[2:00:36.680 --> 2:00:41.320]  trying to stall our economy and if we don't get it going we're in so much trouble all the economists
[2:00:41.320 --> 2:00:47.080]  admit and then they're rooting against our own economy and they're just so bad it's like how
[2:00:47.080 --> 2:00:53.080]  do we get such a group of bad people in both parties in control of this country we got a psychiatrist
[2:00:53.080 --> 2:00:58.120]  here that's worked in the government for decades and knows this I mean I'm just I know you have
[2:00:58.120 --> 2:01:02.920]  a lot to cover on the economy and other stuff in closing dr pacenic cpc.com but just humor me for
[2:01:02.920 --> 2:01:06.920]  a minute because I'm not billing that we're the good guys either I'm not perfect but I'm not out
[2:01:06.920 --> 2:01:14.120]  to get the country what is wrong with these people what's wrong is the fact that they're irrelevant
[2:01:14.120 --> 2:01:19.240]  and I've said it for a long time they're beginning to understand that they're totally irrelevant
[2:01:19.240 --> 2:01:25.480]  the new york times which is owned by a drug lord as you and I know the washington post by bezos
[2:01:25.480 --> 2:01:31.800]  basically you don't need any of those people anymore you anticipated along with others that we
[2:01:31.800 --> 2:01:37.560]  would be on the internet what happened is you had what we call first advantage and the minute you
[2:01:37.560 --> 2:01:44.040]  got out there the people who had no idea what was going on they began to realize 10 15 years
[2:01:44.040 --> 2:01:51.320]  later oh my god this guy alex jones has really understood the new communication pattern which
[2:01:51.320 --> 2:01:57.560]  is about binary numbers one and zero but with all the think tanks that are in washington the brookings
[2:01:57.560 --> 2:02:03.480]  the heritage and this foundation or that found they're all worthless they're basically nursing
[2:02:03.480 --> 2:02:09.960]  homes for people who have no jobs so you have washington one huge nursing home for millions
[2:02:09.960 --> 2:02:15.240]  of people who are not effective we have top secret clearance for a million and they have people
[2:02:15.240 --> 2:02:20.760]  and counter terrorism i don't know what they do they don't do anything i don't even get paid for
[2:02:20.760 --> 2:02:25.160]  what i do and i'm more than happy to help our intelligence community yet our intelligence
[2:02:25.160 --> 2:02:30.840]  community is so bloated that they you need somebody to clean it out now of course maxine
[2:02:32.520 --> 2:02:39.640]  you made me laugh but it's not that's nico it's not only her and there is a bunch of republicans
[2:02:39.640 --> 2:02:45.000]  too basically when you go to congress i've treated congressmen and senators they don't really do
[2:02:45.000 --> 2:02:50.360]  anything when you ask them what have you done in a day they don't know it's all process well we
[2:02:50.360 --> 2:02:56.120]  don't need process anymore in the 21st century so we get rid of the people who need the process to
[2:02:56.120 --> 2:03:02.200]  live trump does not need process you do not need process i do not need process the reason why
[2:03:02.200 --> 2:03:09.000]  trump doesn't need process is because he fires in seconds but he builds an asset whether it's a
[2:03:09.000 --> 2:03:14.200]  hotel whether it's a building whether it's a golf club or whether it's the economy in the americas
[2:03:14.200 --> 2:03:19.960]  he's building an asset so that's what they're not used to you have nancy polosi who should be in a
[2:03:19.960 --> 2:03:26.440]  nursing home nico stop that i know what he's doing i can't help it because these are the
[2:03:26.440 --> 2:03:31.720]  antiquated people you're talking about 79 year old antiquated he keeps sitting in the george
[2:03:31.720 --> 2:03:37.160]  bush is still in office and and and then maxine waters thinks putin invaded korea i mean they're
[2:03:37.160 --> 2:03:43.320]  nuts that's the absurdity now from my point of view and for your point of view you keep on doing
[2:03:43.320 --> 2:03:49.080]  what you're doing they're self-destructing what you're watching is the hierarchy of literally the
[2:03:49.080 --> 2:03:56.680]  democratic party of congress and of the senate we don't need them trump realizes with executive orders
[2:03:56.680 --> 2:04:03.640]  we can move this whole country forward and at the same time trump had delegitimized obama
[2:04:03.640 --> 2:04:09.160]  who came out of nowhere has no history accomplished absolutely nothing so you think they're going
[2:04:09.160 --> 2:04:14.440]  to be unsuccessful bringing trump down i'm sorry so you think right now they're going to be unsuccessful
[2:04:14.440 --> 2:04:19.560]  bring it out totally unsuccessful there's there's not going to be a turnaround on trump he can do
[2:04:19.560 --> 2:04:26.120]  what he wants basically i would advise him to get rid of the jared pushners and the gulman sacks boys
[2:04:26.120 --> 2:04:32.120]  but get rid of the press he doesn't need all that nonsense all he has to do is constantly sit down
[2:04:32.120 --> 2:04:38.040]  evaluate the problem implement a solution and he will do exceedingly well the issue he's getting
[2:04:38.040 --> 2:04:44.200]  caught into is the process not the noise that's created by all the liberals and the so-called
[2:04:44.200 --> 2:04:49.560]  robot republicans we don't need mccain we don't need a lindsay graham we don't need any of them but
[2:04:49.560 --> 2:04:55.320]  there they want to be relevant the only relevancy they have is that we have to pay their that's
[2:04:55.320 --> 2:04:58.600]  right they want to get the way of the recovery all right thank you dr pacenic phone calls and
[2:04:58.600 --> 2:05:03.160]  clubs coming up stay with us thank you doc last week a study was released showing the differences
[2:05:03.160 --> 2:05:07.960]  between vaccinated kids and non-vaccinated kids info wars dot com covered this pointing out the
[2:05:07.960 --> 2:05:12.520]  pushback of these studies being censored while more pushback has begun the boston herald published
[2:05:12.520 --> 2:05:17.640]  an editorial from the entire editorial staff which is now calling for anyone pushing anti-vaccine
[2:05:17.640 --> 2:05:22.600]  rhetoric to be hung the well-written legal speed quote is lying to vulnerable people about the
[2:05:22.600 --> 2:05:26.920]  health and safety of their children ought to be a hanging offense this after insinuating that
[2:05:26.920 --> 2:05:31.880]  anti-vaccine people are responsible for a measles outbreak in a somali community in minnesota this
[2:05:31.880 --> 2:05:37.480]  story claims as fact vaccines don't cause autism when some have it already listed as a side effect
[2:05:37.480 --> 2:05:41.480]  of course the irony of their statement regarding hanging people who lie about the health and safety
[2:05:41.480 --> 2:05:46.600]  of children is it ultimately would fall back on them if they do indeed promote the idea that vaccines
[2:05:46.600 --> 2:05:51.720]  cannot be linked to autism a blatant lie about the health and safety of children my guess is this
[2:05:51.720 --> 2:05:56.760]  same editorial staff would support abortion but somehow they don't believe that is a threat to the
[2:05:56.760 --> 2:06:01.880]  lives and safety of children for info wars dot com this is owens shroyer after being sold out for

[2:08:12.600 --> 2:08:18.360]  from another time i am nothing more than a reminder to you that you cannot destroy truth by burning
[2:08:18.360 --> 2:08:25.160]  pages you're a book mr wordsworth a crawling insect an ugly misforn little creature who has no
[2:08:25.160 --> 2:08:34.280]  purpose here no meaning i am a human being words mr wordsworth that have no substance and no dimension
[2:08:34.280 --> 2:08:40.600]  like air like the winds i don't care i tell you i don't care i'm a human being i exist
[2:08:41.480 --> 2:08:49.160]  if i speak one for a lot that thought lives even after i'm shoveled into my grave delusions
[2:08:49.160 --> 2:08:56.440]  mr wordsworth delusions that you inject into your veins to make you think you have a strength
[2:08:56.440 --> 2:09:02.840]  but you have no strength at all you have nothing but spindly limbs of a dream and the state has no
[2:09:02.840 --> 2:09:11.480]  use for your kind resistance to tyrants is obedience to god it's alex jones
[2:09:15.880 --> 2:09:22.440]  your interview was 60 minutes trump left comey's future hanging in the balance fbi director
[2:09:22.440 --> 2:09:30.040]  james comey um are you gonna ask for his resignation i think that i would rather not
[2:09:30.040 --> 2:09:33.720]  comment on that yet i don't i haven't made up my mind
[2:09:38.200 --> 2:09:42.360]  huge story that broke a little just minutes ago like less than 10 minutes ago
[2:09:43.080 --> 2:09:46.840]  fbi director james comey has just been fired by donald trump
[2:09:51.240 --> 2:09:56.520]  huge huge donald trump fans here tonight do you believe that uh jim comey should resign
[2:09:56.520 --> 2:10:03.240]  senator e of course yes it's classified and we can't tell you anything all i can tell you is
[2:10:03.240 --> 2:10:10.360]  the fbi director has no credibility that's it well first of all let's start again he was acting
[2:10:10.360 --> 2:10:15.560]  in concert in coordination with the house republicans in the story i'm just saying director comey
[2:10:15.560 --> 2:10:21.560]  testified this week and he made it very plain uh that he broke the fbi rules with respect to the
[2:10:21.560 --> 2:10:26.200]  clinton campaign and he chose not to break the rules with respect to the trump campaign
[2:10:26.200 --> 2:10:31.400]  and that was a factor there are many factors but i think it will go down as probably the lowest
[2:10:31.400 --> 2:10:38.120]  moment in the history of the fbi probably next to the decision of jad grohoover to wiretap martin
[2:10:38.120 --> 2:10:45.560]  lucer king so now we have comey putting his finger on the scale and yeah up until then people thought
[2:10:45.560 --> 2:10:55.240]  great things about him but this is unprecedented i think that uh comey acted in an outrageous way
[2:10:55.240 --> 2:11:03.320]  uh during the campaign should he step down i think he should take a hard look at uh what he
[2:11:03.320 --> 2:11:08.120]  has done uh and i think it would not be a bad thing for the american people if he did step down
[2:11:08.120 --> 2:11:14.040]  my confidence in the fbi director's ability to lead this agency has been shaken and then at least
[2:11:14.040 --> 2:11:19.400]  one democratic lawmaker is calling on comey to resign and director call me supposed to be an
[2:11:19.400 --> 2:11:23.640]  investigator who reports to the u to the justice department and not somebody who comes out and
[2:11:23.640 --> 2:11:29.240]  makes news himself he's gone too far but for the first time president obama taking a swipe at his
[2:11:29.240 --> 2:11:38.040]  fbi director james comey there is a norm that you know when there are investigations we don't
[2:11:38.040 --> 2:11:45.400]  operate on innuendo we don't operate on incomplete information we don't operate on leaks we operate
[2:11:45.400 --> 2:11:51.640]  based on concrete decisions that are made it was when i heard about it i i found it hard to believe
[2:11:51.640 --> 2:11:59.000]  that comey who i thought had some degree of integrity would do this earlier this afternoon
[2:11:59.960 --> 2:12:07.000]  president trump called me and informed me he was firing director comey i told the president
[2:12:07.000 --> 2:12:12.440]  mr president with all due respect you were making a big mistake wrong
[2:12:16.760 --> 2:12:21.000]  now that's only some of the clips this morning i saw three or four more videos
[2:12:21.000 --> 2:12:24.520]  that we put out others have put out that didn't even have the same clips in them
[2:12:24.520 --> 2:12:31.080]  i could fill the whole show basically with democrats doing the most perfect 180 flip
[2:12:31.080 --> 2:12:37.560]  flops i've ever seen so let's say the democrats are going this direction
[2:12:39.560 --> 2:12:47.320]  they're going north saying get rid of comey and then as soon as trump agrees with them
[2:12:47.320 --> 2:12:58.200]  they do a perfect 180 and go the other direction 180 degrees they don't do a u turn
[2:12:58.200 --> 2:13:01.880]  take a while to get back to it they didn't start changing their story and saying well
[2:13:01.880 --> 2:13:08.520]  before we thought this but now we think that they just did a perfect bat turn a 180
[2:13:08.520 --> 2:13:18.920]  pretty amazing and now they're acting like that never even happened i want to open the
[2:13:18.920 --> 2:13:23.880]  phones up in the balance of the transmission today before we have in the fourth hour an
[2:13:23.880 --> 2:13:29.080]  amazing guest roger stone obviously on the night that the new netflix series get me roger stone
[2:13:29.080 --> 2:13:34.680]  premieres and i don't watch a lot of television but uh i do watch some netflix because it's got
[2:13:34.680 --> 2:13:41.720]  some good series on it HBO's got a few good series as well i noticed the series true detective
[2:13:41.720 --> 2:13:49.000]  kind of mirrors the real world they take real cases and then kind of just change them change the
[2:13:49.000 --> 2:13:57.800]  geography change the names but i've now watched parts of both seasons and it's real cases and the
[2:13:57.800 --> 2:14:05.480]  older i get the more i realize so much of fiction is where they take reality sheep dip it so they
[2:14:05.480 --> 2:14:10.600]  don't get sued and just change the names but police will tell you and detectives will tell you
[2:14:10.600 --> 2:14:17.560]  devil worship child molestation is just rampant and they're constantly getting it shut down but
[2:14:17.560 --> 2:14:22.840]  in the case of netflix roger says he's seen it he says they made him the villain or they
[2:14:22.840 --> 2:14:26.760]  wouldn't have done the piece because overall it's it's pretty entertaining and a lot of it's accurate
[2:14:26.760 --> 2:14:34.440]  but they say he's this evil guy that constantly lies i haven't caught roger stone in one lie
[2:14:34.440 --> 2:14:41.240]  because the most valuable thing we have is telling the truth that's the currency i have is telling
[2:14:41.240 --> 2:14:47.160]  the truth when we make a mistake occasionally i'll tell you so i'm gonna find out tonight
[2:14:47.880 --> 2:14:52.840]  whenever i guess it goes live at like eight o'clock eastern or something i'm gonna sit back
[2:14:52.840 --> 2:14:59.160]  and watch the first episode of this supposed you know horrible evil villain roger stone and you
[2:14:59.160 --> 2:15:04.760]  know the supposed russian connections and all the rest of the crap my problem is i literally have
[2:15:04.760 --> 2:15:11.800]  gotten to where i don't pay attention to tv cameras and so i'm kind of dreading it because one thing
[2:15:11.800 --> 2:15:17.160]  they got right in the buzzfeed store they wrote about me a few weeks ago that was like 90 twisted
[2:15:17.160 --> 2:15:23.640]  disinformation fiction half of it was just totally made up was that i am socially oblivious and it
[2:15:23.640 --> 2:15:30.840]  really is true like you think it's good there's no teleprompter you think it's good that i'm not up
[2:15:30.840 --> 2:15:36.040]  here you know trying to polish what i say yeah it's good except i got so mad at keith oberman
[2:15:38.520 --> 2:15:43.880]  that i broke two bottles of uh info wars live products they're just i mean i just broke them
[2:15:43.880 --> 2:15:49.640]  when i went to break because i was so upset with keith oberman i and now i'm totally exhausted i've
[2:15:49.640 --> 2:15:53.560]  got all this work to do today and i got mad for like 30 minutes i could get mad for a couple
[2:15:53.560 --> 2:15:58.040]  minutes now okay but i'm 43 i'm not 20 anymore and i'll just tell you a point blank
[2:16:02.280 --> 2:16:07.080]  i say i let myself get mad people ask are you an actor or you're not an actor i'm the most
[2:16:07.080 --> 2:16:15.480]  unfalst person you'll ever meet i'm the most genuine person you'll ever know but i try to control myself
[2:16:16.600 --> 2:16:23.640]  so when i get mad it's real but i'm in control of it except every once in a while when i'm no
[2:16:23.640 --> 2:16:30.200]  longer in control of it and then i just get so upset and for whatever reason i'm so exhausted right
[2:16:30.200 --> 2:16:42.280]  now i just can't stand these people they are such liars they're such scum they're out to get this
[2:16:42.280 --> 2:16:54.200]  country and it's so obvious we should be able to deal with them and if anything not letting
[2:16:54.200 --> 2:17:00.440]  myself get as mad as i really want to it's probably where i'm acting because the acting
[2:17:00.440 --> 2:17:03.160]  is that i'm holding back saying what i really think about people like him
[2:17:08.200 --> 2:17:08.680]  excuse me
[2:17:16.760 --> 2:17:21.560]  i just start thinking about these people and what how they're out to get us how they think
[2:17:21.560 --> 2:17:26.840]  they're better than us and i just think about what trash they are what scummy families they come from
[2:17:26.840 --> 2:17:31.960]  how dishonest they are how twisted they are how they want to hurt good people
[2:17:34.280 --> 2:17:42.600]  and they make me absolutely enraged and sick to my stomach because they're a pack of scum
[2:17:44.040 --> 2:17:50.120]  and they bully a lot of well-meaning people into following their ideology of modern leftist garbage
[2:17:50.120 --> 2:17:57.080]  by peer pressure most liberals are not bad people they really believe the lies of people like Keith
[2:17:57.080 --> 2:18:08.760]  Overman and Stephen Colbert and Bill Maher and those guys are preying on their viewers and
[2:18:08.760 --> 2:18:15.720]  everything scripted and they know full well what they're doing and i just think my lucky stars i'm
[2:18:15.720 --> 2:18:21.000]  not one of them i got a bunch of clips i want to play but the toll free number to join us is 800

[2:18:36.280 --> 2:18:41.160]  team watch and i i mean i can't list everybody but kit is so prolific you're at like five articles
[2:18:41.160 --> 2:18:48.440]  a day just on fire and i feel guilty all the time like i'm not you giving justice to this great crew
[2:18:48.440 --> 2:18:53.400]  and these great people and then they all like me sometimes they get to watch me act like a monkey
[2:18:54.360 --> 2:18:58.680]  but you know what at least i am like a monkey at least i do care at least i'm not polishing fake
[2:18:58.680 --> 2:19:05.720]  at least i really do feel this way because those creepers like bill maher they know exactly what
[2:19:05.720 --> 2:19:12.840]  they're doing and i i want to see them pay i want to see them brought to justice i want to see them
[2:19:12.840 --> 2:19:17.320]  and all their corruption because they're so dumb they're so stupid they read off teleprompters
[2:19:17.320 --> 2:19:21.960]  they've got all these writers and they just act with their body language like they're confident
[2:19:21.960 --> 2:19:25.320]  and they know what they're talking about and what they are is seedy dartbags
[2:19:27.480 --> 2:19:31.080]  they all hate me because they know i see them but look at the story about kid nails
[2:19:31.080 --> 2:19:35.560]  hungry electrifies border wall and defiance of EU migrant quota

[2:25:31.480 --> 2:25:37.880]  states but the people that have hijacked our government are false flagging so that they can
[2:25:37.880 --> 2:25:43.560]  get more power over the cyber control of the country let's get tibetan back on right now i know he
[2:25:43.560 --> 2:25:48.680]  just left but he's an expert on cyber hacking rote net force with tom clancy works with the cia and
[2:25:48.680 --> 2:25:54.040]  other agencies on predicting a lot of this this is in the new york times cyber attacks in 12
[2:25:54.040 --> 2:25:59.480]  nations said to use leaks nsa hacking tool if you can't do it understand let's just get somebody on
[2:25:59.480 --> 2:26:05.480]  about this an extensive cyber attack struck computers across a wide swath of europe and asia friday
[2:26:06.360 --> 2:26:10.040]  and strained the public health system in britain where doctors were blocked from patient files
[2:26:10.040 --> 2:26:15.800]  and emergency rooms were forced to divert patients the attack involved ransomware a kind of malware
[2:26:16.840 --> 2:26:22.200]  that encrypts data and locks out the user according to security experts it exploited vulnerability
[2:26:23.720 --> 2:26:29.160]  that was discovered and developed by the national security agency the hacking tool was leaked by
[2:26:29.160 --> 2:26:34.680]  group of calling itself shadow brokers which has been dumping stolen nsa hacking tools on online
[2:26:34.680 --> 2:26:39.160]  beginning last year microsoft rolled out a patch for the vulnerability last march but hackers took
[2:26:39.160 --> 2:26:43.240]  advantage of the fact of the vulnerable targets particularly hospitals had yet to update their
[2:26:43.240 --> 2:26:52.760]  systems and they attacked hospitals you know i think it's probably behind us probably turkey
[2:26:54.440 --> 2:27:01.400]  turkey is involved some of the dirtiest stuff out there who knows probably globalist intelligence
[2:27:01.400 --> 2:27:07.560]  agencies i don't know the malware was circulated by email targets were sent out encrypted compressed
[2:27:07.560 --> 2:27:12.360]  file that once loaded allowed the ransomware infiltrate its targets Reuters reports the
[2:27:12.360 --> 2:27:17.160]  employees of britain's national health service were warned about the ransomware threat earlier on
[2:27:17.160 --> 2:27:21.160]  friday but of course bureaucrats did nothing of course you can also say it's doing them a favor
[2:27:21.160 --> 2:27:25.240]  making them get ready to deal with these type of threats because they're a bunch of lazy people
[2:27:25.240 --> 2:27:30.360]  in their own world with their horrible health care in the uk worst health care in the world
[2:27:30.360 --> 2:27:36.760]  in many cases the socialist countries like cuba ransomware infections reported worldwide bbc news
[2:27:37.880 --> 2:27:42.840]  cyber attack plunges nhs into chaos as computers shut down across the country
[2:27:45.160 --> 2:27:47.240]  nhs cyber attack spreads worldwide
[2:27:49.640 --> 2:27:54.920]  detroit school told to hold muslim girls only prom to get to that coming up i was going to get into
[2:27:54.920 --> 2:27:59.560]  the vice president coming out saying he's going to defend christians and that there's a genocide
[2:27:59.560 --> 2:28:04.440]  of christians going on that is certainly important we got a bunch of callers i'll go to dennis
[2:28:04.440 --> 2:28:08.440]  i'll go to jesse i'll go to matthew i'll go to dean i'll go to shon and i'd also like to ask folks
[2:28:10.440 --> 2:28:14.840]  if they're computer programmers or hacking experts or security experts cyber security experts
[2:28:14.840 --> 2:28:21.160]  you can get in tell us what you think about this 800 2599231 i know most hackers are white hat
[2:28:21.960 --> 2:28:26.120]  i've had hackers before call up and say there's a problem here let me show you i'll turn your
[2:28:26.120 --> 2:28:29.640]  website off in two minutes they turn it off or we show there's a problem here is probably just
[2:28:29.640 --> 2:28:35.880]  help us never ask for money i've demanded to pay them before uh because most of them are good people
[2:28:36.600 --> 2:28:40.760]  but there are some really really nasty folks out there and so many times i'm out lionizing russia
[2:28:41.560 --> 2:28:46.760]  but russia gets blamed for cyber attacks and being the main pushers of it and it's in the info
[2:28:47.400 --> 2:28:52.360]  the vault seven information that they're they're they're framing russia and that shows that that's
[2:28:52.360 --> 2:28:57.720]  one of the main targets for criminal elements of our government frame russia to create this narrative
[2:28:59.080 --> 2:29:02.520]  i remember curtain demo like eight years ago or something wrote an article where the head of
[2:29:02.520 --> 2:29:06.520]  cyber security at the time they were just setting it up admitted that they'd run false flags to get
[2:29:06.520 --> 2:29:10.520]  congress's attention of course the cia got caught spying on members of the congress
[2:29:12.280 --> 2:29:17.240]  so the claim that president trump's not being spied on by comey is just laughable
[2:29:17.240 --> 2:29:23.800]  they caught him they admitted they did it it happened all right we'll be right back don't
[2:29:23.800 --> 2:29:27.880]  forget we've got a new limited edition 1000 run big color poster by a well-known artist
[2:29:28.920 --> 2:29:33.640]  with donald trump myself paul watson pep in the frog and other politically incorrect things
[2:29:33.640 --> 2:29:41.640]  roger stone and it's nine it's 1776 and it's a great collector's item infowarstore.com it'll
[2:29:41.640 --> 2:29:46.600]  be sold out probably in a day our triple eight two five three three one three nine and your purchase
[2:29:46.600 --> 2:29:51.320]  helps make this operation be funded so thank you we would mirror without you we're on the march
[2:29:51.320 --> 2:29:56.680]  the empire's on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network
[2:30:00.920 --> 2:30:07.800]  so today i want to talk about killing white people in context a texas a and m professor says that
[2:30:07.800 --> 2:30:15.960]  some white people may have to die in order to solve racism and bring about true equality
[2:30:15.960 --> 2:30:19.880]  when we have this conversation about violence or killing white people it has to be looked at in
[2:30:19.880 --> 2:30:24.440]  this kind of historical term and the fact that we've had no one address like how relevant and how
[2:30:24.440 --> 2:30:29.240]  the litified this kind of tradition is for black people saying look in order to be equal in order
[2:30:29.240 --> 2:30:34.280]  to be liberated some white people may have to die that was professor tommy curry on the ready
[2:30:34.280 --> 2:30:41.240]  news review podcast who went on to say that the movie jango unchained made killing white people
[2:30:41.240 --> 2:30:48.760]  look fun but in reality it should be part of a serious discussion so far it is unknown if law
[2:30:48.760 --> 2:30:55.640]  enforcement officials or homeland security are investigating tommy curry for his violent racist
[2:30:55.640 --> 2:31:04.600]  and terroristic threats and you can learn more right now at info wars dot com let's go to david

[2:33:15.480 --> 2:33:18.440]  all right we're going to your phone calls here in just a moment i'm going to put on screen for
[2:33:18.440 --> 2:33:25.640]  tv viewers all the scrabbit for radio listeners a global graph that shows where the current
[2:33:25.640 --> 2:33:31.880]  cyber attacks are taking place and places that have already been hit also where there's active
[2:33:31.880 --> 2:33:37.320]  computers now being attacked we'll put that on screen for folks we'll also put it behind us here
[2:33:37.320 --> 2:33:43.080]  for tv viewers but uh there you have it that's the cyber threat real time map
[2:33:48.760 --> 2:33:53.640]  that's disperse key that puts out that map tied into the big cyber security centers all over the
[2:33:53.640 --> 2:34:00.360]  world and you can see new attacks that are happening reportedly in the purple you can follow each
[2:34:00.360 --> 2:34:09.400]  attack through into what's being hit and the isps as it goes to the cyber terrain you can see the
[2:34:09.400 --> 2:34:15.640]  new attacks as they're taking place you can see the older attacks it's amazing with technology
[2:34:15.640 --> 2:34:20.840]  we've got to track all this but it appears the biggest area of being attacked currently in a
[2:34:20.840 --> 2:34:28.520]  cyber war is in western europe and in the uk and obviously that's all admitted but there's also
[2:34:28.520 --> 2:34:34.760]  attacks spreading out from there across the planet as the software loaded on the computers
[2:34:34.760 --> 2:34:48.920]  as the viruses begin to activate with the malware kaspersky.com is the site where you can see that
[2:34:48.920 --> 2:34:56.520]  and again we'll put it up behind us on screen for tv viewers right now i'm going to go to
[2:34:56.520 --> 2:35:01.720]  Cindy, Jesse, Matthew, Dean, Sean and others as soon as you hear one call or hang up that's your
[2:35:01.720 --> 2:35:09.080]  chance to call in i'd love to hear from you here on this friday edition 800-25-99231 i told my wife
[2:35:09.080 --> 2:35:15.000]  today be ready for me to work a bunch this weekend because as you can say i felt disturbance
[2:35:15.000 --> 2:35:20.280]  in the force and i don't mean that literally but almost i could just feel the energy in the country
[2:35:20.280 --> 2:35:23.880]  and see what was happening what's happening with trump and could tell that a lot of stuff was
[2:35:23.880 --> 2:35:28.200]  about to kick off so look for some live broadcasts this weekend i'll definitely be back this sunday
[2:35:28.200 --> 2:35:33.400]  obviously four to six p.m central but look for a lot more throughout the weekend at info wars.com
[2:35:34.040 --> 2:35:40.360]  and prisonplanet.com as all of this basically continues to unfold i want to take some of your calls
[2:35:40.360 --> 2:35:50.280]  and then i'm going to get to some amazing video of the vice president pence where he lays out
[2:35:51.880 --> 2:35:58.600]  in a major conservative conference put on by billy graham's son franklin graham the threat and
[2:35:58.600 --> 2:36:04.760]  we tell you it's refreshing when i was watching fox news this morning and franklin graham came on
[2:36:04.760 --> 2:36:08.200]  i said watch he won't say radical islam and they won't say that all these christians
[2:36:08.200 --> 2:36:13.960]  getting killed are mainly by muslims and sure enough he did say it and christians are the
[2:36:13.960 --> 2:36:20.120]  number one persecuted group christians are being targeted and whether it's pandering or not by
[2:36:20.120 --> 2:36:23.960]  pence and trump i don't care they're doing something about it and then we need to raise
[2:36:23.960 --> 2:36:29.160]  the alarm and get through this political correctness and if they launch wars that are to take out
[2:36:29.160 --> 2:36:35.400]  non-radical muslim countries then i'll be against trump but right now he was against the iraq war
[2:36:35.400 --> 2:36:39.400]  he's against the syria war he wants to take out the radical muslims that have invaded
[2:36:39.400 --> 2:36:44.520]  that's good because obama and the global has started that war so that's why i'm supporting
[2:36:44.520 --> 2:36:48.680]  eradicating i do not support the reports that big masters which we first broke with cernovich
[2:36:49.960 --> 2:36:52.680]  where he wants to have 150 000 troops to have a ground war and remove
[2:36:53.560 --> 2:37:00.840]  asad and isis asad didn't start the war asad was democratizing they use the openness of his country
[2:37:00.840 --> 2:37:08.600]  to do that but enough on that subject that clip's coming up i want to commend vice president pence
[2:37:10.920 --> 2:37:15.800]  trump was delivering like 99 percent until about day 70 then he started going back about 20 percent
[2:37:15.800 --> 2:37:20.680]  on what he said he'd do now he's made a big turn this week right back into what he said he would do
[2:37:22.040 --> 2:37:27.960]  and i've been told by four sources in the white house that trump's taken the gloves off and is
[2:37:27.960 --> 2:37:33.240]  going to basically go on a rampage now because oh by the way have they tweeted it out yet
[2:37:34.600 --> 2:37:37.720]  because i've noticed that trump likes to do this thing where he writes letters
[2:37:37.720 --> 2:37:42.680]  with a hidden message in the first line the founders like to do that too it you know chose
[2:37:42.680 --> 2:37:48.040]  your skilled language and it tells comey i win so i saw that during a break earlier like the
[2:37:48.040 --> 2:37:52.520]  20 after break i didn't have time to tweet it myself i asked the guys to tweet it and asked for
[2:37:52.520 --> 2:37:57.880]  don to post on infowars.com we pull up real alex jones real quick before we go to calls uh because
[2:37:57.880 --> 2:38:02.200]  i do believe they put that out but regardless i want to show people that and tweet it out at
[2:38:02.200 --> 2:38:05.880]  real alex shows i mean i do a lot of own tweeting but also the crew tweets out some of their own
[2:38:05.880 --> 2:38:12.840]  stories here let's scroll down and see now i don't guess that's been tweeted out yet so we'll uh
[2:38:13.640 --> 2:38:17.800]  try to get that tweeted out or maybe i'll just there it is they did tweet it out wow
[2:38:17.800 --> 2:38:22.760]  wow dear comey and then you look at the first line and then you look at the
[2:38:24.760 --> 2:38:25.800]  sixth line down there
[2:38:28.680 --> 2:38:30.600]  dear director comey i win
[2:38:34.600 --> 2:38:37.480]  he also did it in an irs letter so it's pretty funny
[2:38:38.680 --> 2:38:40.200]  Donald trump is just something else
[2:38:42.120 --> 2:38:45.720]  and he writes his own letters i mean the guy is just amazing
[2:38:45.720 --> 2:38:49.960]  he's definitely a character folks you want somebody that's his own man you want somebody
[2:38:49.960 --> 2:38:55.160]  that's actually president doesn't mean he's gonna be perfect we didn't you know hire a pastor
[2:38:56.760 --> 2:39:02.200]  we heard a bull in a china cabinet and boy he's got all the scum angry all right cindy jesse
[2:39:02.200 --> 2:39:09.080]  matthew deem shon let's talk to folks in wyoming first let's talk to shon shon thanks for calling
[2:39:09.080 --> 2:39:13.560]  today you're on the air worldwide thank you alex i haven't talked with you in a little while i've
[2:39:13.560 --> 2:39:18.360]  been fighting a constitutional issue that are preparing for the courts but i'm the fellow who was
[2:39:19.240 --> 2:39:25.400]  there uh with uh reagan when he was um the sub-diffuse that went on and when he was um
[2:39:25.400 --> 2:39:29.320]  that's right yet you haven't called in four or five years and i talked to folks that know you
[2:39:29.320 --> 2:39:32.760]  and i even recommended some guests that were there that we had on i even talked to phyllis
[2:39:32.760 --> 2:39:36.200]  schlafly she was aware of the work you did so you were there when they made him take
[2:39:36.200 --> 2:39:40.680]  george herbert walker bush you were there when they made him compromise that's right compromise
[2:39:40.680 --> 2:39:46.440]  they gave me the um the uh the press release that i took from the detroit plaza hotel the
[2:39:46.440 --> 2:39:51.640]  following day which was thursday morning over to the four bush boys in a suite at the potcha
[2:39:51.640 --> 2:39:57.000]  train across jefferson avenue and then um and then they told me not to look in the file and i
[2:39:57.000 --> 2:40:01.640]  looked in the file anyways it was the history of george herbert walker bush and oddly enough
[2:40:02.200 --> 2:40:08.680]  in uh cody wyoming in 1988 i opened uh i cracked open the book anthony Sutton's book the secret
[2:40:08.680 --> 2:40:13.400]  establishment the americans american secret establishment the illuminati and it had a
[2:40:13.400 --> 2:40:19.960]  history on one page of uh of george herbert walker's previous uh his history with as a pot
[2:40:19.960 --> 2:40:25.320]  oil and so forth and i said to myself my god i saw this someplace before and it was in that
[2:40:25.320 --> 2:40:32.600]  file i took across to the bush boys but listen my friend i've been very concerned as as you have
[2:40:32.600 --> 2:40:39.880]  about trump possibly being um a compromise that but the key here is that i want to make is you
[2:40:39.880 --> 2:40:46.120]  and roger stone because i've talked with roger stone and myself we cut our teeth on the patriot
[2:40:46.120 --> 2:40:54.600]  movement decades ago as fervent anti-communist so we can recognize a trader uh like keith oberman
[2:40:54.600 --> 2:40:59.960]  before us and they're all over i have a quote i just want to finish with a quote from a garther
[2:40:59.960 --> 2:41:04.600]  when i was in the ninth grade and i i know that you would appreciate this when i was in the ninth
[2:41:04.600 --> 2:41:12.440]  grade i memorized the macarthur's final address to congress verbatim and also some other quotes
[2:41:12.440 --> 2:41:18.520]  and they're applicable to now because we really are old soldiers never die country it just hasn't
[2:41:18.520 --> 2:41:26.040]  turned hot yet i beg to differ with our friend uh dr pechenek he he's he's always so optimistic but
[2:41:26.040 --> 2:41:31.400]  i'm i'm not always so optimistic now hear me make your point but but since you say it and he said
[2:41:31.400 --> 2:41:38.680]  old soldiers never die they just fade away that was his famous address absolutely but but there's
[2:41:38.680 --> 2:41:45.880]  also a tremendous quote that i i had other quotes that i that is by macarthur there's apropos today
[2:41:46.440 --> 2:41:52.520]  and it is and it is this the history of failure the war can be summed up in two words too late
[2:41:52.520 --> 2:41:57.240]  too late in comprehending the deadly purpose of a potential enemy too late in recognizing
[2:41:57.240 --> 2:42:04.040]  the mortal danger too late in preparedness too late in uniting all possible forces for resistance
[2:42:04.040 --> 2:42:11.800]  and too late in standing with one's friends that's right and i hope we're not too late that's why i
[2:42:11.800 --> 2:42:16.200]  hope every man woman child no matter what color you are gets involved the fight for free market
[2:42:16.200 --> 2:42:20.600]  god bless you i appreciate your call one of the greatest victories the dirtbag democrats have had
[2:42:22.840 --> 2:42:30.040]  is tricking the republicans in 1962 to become racist the republican party had been the anti
[2:42:30.040 --> 2:42:36.920]  racism party since its founding it had been the christian party and my family was in the south
[2:42:36.920 --> 2:42:41.640]  and the north did horrible atrocities but the south got tricked into that war by british
[2:42:41.640 --> 2:42:47.160]  intelligence folks and it was wrong to ever have the war and andrew jackson was right to stop it 25
[2:42:47.160 --> 2:42:53.640]  years earlier he was a big southerner and the south just got suckered into that like a bunch of idiots
[2:42:54.440 --> 2:42:59.000]  by british intelligence not by the north and it was just a horrible war of americans killing americans
[2:42:59.000 --> 2:43:01.880]  robert e lee was the head of the northern army before that they tried to make him the head of
[2:43:01.880 --> 2:43:07.160]  that and he said no that's why it's so dumb all these idiot leftists want to pull down robert e
[2:43:07.160 --> 2:43:13.800]  lee statues he was the most respected man in the north for the next 30 years he was the model of
[2:43:13.800 --> 2:43:19.560]  being an honorable man he didn't want that war but once they attacked the south he had to but
[2:43:19.560 --> 2:43:24.040]  i don't want to digress into a history lesson i don't know why i started getting off of the civil
[2:43:24.040 --> 2:43:30.040]  war remember he was bringing up wars and all the rest of it but the bottom line is they're trying
[2:43:30.040 --> 2:43:35.640]  to cause a new civil war in this country and we don't need to have one we don't need to go through
[2:43:35.640 --> 2:43:42.920]  all this and i'm talking about the republicans the republicans are the ones that pass the civil
[2:43:42.920 --> 2:43:47.960]  rights act the republicans had a christian strategy and it was working and the democrats
[2:43:47.960 --> 2:43:53.560]  were about to become a regional party of the south that's why you always hear that republicans are
[2:43:53.560 --> 2:43:58.920]  about to be a regional party of the south from democrats because they know that's what had happened
[2:43:58.920 --> 2:44:06.840]  to them by the 60s so they suddenly completely flipped like super liberal and put out the wildest
[2:44:06.840 --> 2:44:11.880]  stuff you know that was politically correct and suddenly republicans went what are you talking
[2:44:11.880 --> 2:44:18.760]  about so they kind of jumped into their southern strategy in the south to outraces the democrats
[2:44:20.360 --> 2:44:25.480]  and so that's why democrats now have this image of republicans as the racist when the democrats
[2:44:25.480 --> 2:44:35.800]  are the kkk they are the real deal it's a fact and so you fast forward to what's currently happening
[2:44:36.920 --> 2:44:40.680]  and you've got the last six seven years the democrats saying that tea parties racist and
[2:44:40.680 --> 2:44:45.080]  don't go to it or you'll get beat up if you're black now blacks and hispanics started going and
[2:44:45.080 --> 2:44:50.360]  found out how they were totally embraced by everybody and how people just want free market to
[2:44:50.360 --> 2:44:55.960]  be christians and then have a sovereign nation so trump's big victory is he broke that people know
[2:44:55.960 --> 2:45:01.240]  trump's not racist and they know the tea party isn't now but for eight years or so we heard those
[2:45:01.240 --> 2:45:08.280]  lies but listen i don't care what color you are venezuela cuba north korea eastern europe i don't
[2:45:08.280 --> 2:45:12.600]  care whether it's white people black people whoever it is running things socialism is a hell
[2:45:12.600 --> 2:45:20.760]  it always falls apart it's always picks winners and losers and it just destroys productivity it
[2:45:20.760 --> 2:45:25.640]  destroys the future now we don't have even a perfect free market we've got major crony corruption
[2:45:25.640 --> 2:45:33.560]  socialism in many areas america's got problems but free market is what you want to give your kids
[2:45:34.200 --> 2:45:39.080]  where you've got hundreds of schools to choose from and hundreds of toothbrushes to choose from
[2:45:39.080 --> 2:45:43.720]  and hundreds of phones to choose from and hundreds of hospitals to choose from and hundreds of stores
[2:45:43.720 --> 2:45:49.720]  to buy clothes from and hundreds of places to get your food from and hundreds of parks to go to
[2:45:50.440 --> 2:45:57.640]  and it's just no there's no comparison but the elites don't want you to have that they're always
[2:45:57.640 --> 2:46:01.640]  going to be above the law they're always going to have offshore you know places they want to loot
[2:46:01.640 --> 2:46:07.480]  this country and trump really is trying to stop that and that's his crime i sit there and i look at
[2:46:07.480 --> 2:46:13.800]  the economic numbers they are in every place he signed an executive order and i was ever a fan of
[2:46:13.800 --> 2:46:16.760]  executive orders there's a lot of them are in constitutional here but they're being used for
[2:46:16.760 --> 2:46:22.200]  globalism he's using it against them while they're so pissed right now everything he's doing is just
[2:46:22.200 --> 2:46:26.760]  flooding money to the people flooding jobs flooding factories just flooding development
[2:46:26.760 --> 2:46:32.360]  flooding investment flooding the banking associations giving money to people because
[2:46:32.360 --> 2:46:37.560]  trump knows we're about to go belly up we are on that knife sadge and going belly up right now and
[2:46:37.560 --> 2:46:44.200]  if and if trump doesn't succeed i just got chills we're going to go into a worldwide depression
[2:46:46.520 --> 2:46:51.240]  so understand that ladies and gentlemen that we're doing better than europe we're doing better than
[2:46:51.240 --> 2:46:56.600]  china we're doing better in latin america right now we're doing good and it's not at their expense
[2:46:56.600 --> 2:47:03.160]  either a rising tide raises all ships we have been screwed over so long and i'm telling you
[2:47:03.160 --> 2:47:08.920]  i've researched trump just on the economy just on christians just on tpp just on one of those
[2:47:08.920 --> 2:47:13.880]  things i've backing he's not perfect i'm not in love with him i don't care he calls me sometimes
[2:47:13.880 --> 2:47:18.920]  that means nothing to me in fact it's hurtful when he does stuff that isn't good because then i
[2:47:18.920 --> 2:47:23.800]  want to believe in him but just cold-bloodily looking at this you know a man by his enemies
[2:47:23.800 --> 2:47:29.640]  the scum of the earth hate donald trump folks they call him his own man they call him crazy
[2:47:29.640 --> 2:47:33.800]  because they can't intimidate him they can't get him to do what they want and they are scared and
[2:47:33.800 --> 2:47:41.480]  they better be and i think zuckerberg and the rock running as president and vice president that's
[2:47:41.480 --> 2:47:46.520]  the word i got from some politicos those two are gonna run against trump and i got drain johnson
[2:47:46.520 --> 2:47:51.080]  comes off as very charming i mean you can't help but like the guy he's funny but i mean
[2:47:51.080 --> 2:47:55.960]  he's right there if he runs with zuckerberg he's either an idiot or he's bad
[2:47:58.200 --> 2:48:02.760]  and zuckerberg will turn our recovery around so fast he calls you a dumb effort
[2:48:06.520 --> 2:48:11.720]  so folks you talk to the lane johnson the rock and say do not run with mark zuckerberg because
[2:48:11.720 --> 2:48:16.440]  the word is zuckerberg's already reached out to him i got that from silicon valley individual
[2:48:16.440 --> 2:48:21.640]  a billionaire yesterday i got a call last night right before i went to bed about yeah i heard
[2:48:21.640 --> 2:48:25.640]  you're talking about that with this and that and the rock you do you know they're talking about
[2:48:25.640 --> 2:48:31.320]  those two running as a team do you imagine how horrible that is
[2:48:34.920 --> 2:48:39.080]  but a vampire like zuckerberg needs a well-meaning guy like dwayne johnson
[2:48:40.440 --> 2:48:42.680]  dean in wisconsin thanks for holding her on the air go ahead
[2:48:42.680 --> 2:48:50.360]  hey alex uh this is dean i'm a writer in wisconsin i sent you my uh resume portfolio
[2:48:50.360 --> 2:48:54.840]  everything i sent to trump i even got a video of me working for my union
[2:48:54.840 --> 2:48:58.920]  i just want to say i'm ready to fight whatever you need just email me give me a call
[2:48:59.720 --> 2:49:07.240]  but my question uh is regarding to uh purging the system if trumps a man i think he is
[2:49:07.240 --> 2:49:15.320]  he's got to eventually take down the curtain to know who our true enemy is and to know the truth
[2:49:16.520 --> 2:49:22.760]  i mean if he does that i guarantee you that he'll get our enemy is collectivist and gangs
[2:49:22.760 --> 2:49:27.800]  and global crony capitalist groups that have been funding communism fascism you name it i mean
[2:49:27.800 --> 2:49:32.200]  there's always groups saying it's catholics it's christians it's jews it's muslims and i
[2:49:32.200 --> 2:49:35.560]  don't think it's any of those individual groups that are behind the evil it's evil corrupt
[2:49:35.560 --> 2:49:40.520]  billionaires that manipulate things and play people off against each other but islam itself
[2:49:41.160 --> 2:49:45.240]  under the more orthodox radical form that the saudi arabians are pushing
[2:49:46.600 --> 2:49:51.480]  is is of is the clear and present danger you got the technocrats and the globalists and you've
[2:49:51.480 --> 2:49:57.560]  got islam i see those two as the as you know the main enemy uh who do you think the enemy is
[2:49:58.920 --> 2:50:02.520]  well i definitely agree with what you're saying but i'm saying he has to look like
[2:50:02.520 --> 2:50:09.320]  as far as the fanny may thing he has to expose that and show that and come on i mean i'm just
[2:50:09.320 --> 2:50:15.640]  saying he has to you know i mean like finally you're right who the enemy is but he has to go on
[2:50:16.360 --> 2:50:22.600]  i don't know when or what time but he has to show the people who you know the true enemy is well i
[2:50:22.600 --> 2:50:27.160]  totally agree i mean trump had it leaked to dr corcy and that came from the trump whitehouse i'm not
[2:50:27.160 --> 2:50:31.720]  going to say who but high level about the fanny may freddy mac we broke it now it's in the news two
[2:50:31.720 --> 2:50:36.920]  months later and now trump's saying that they're not going to take money from the government and
[2:50:36.920 --> 2:50:40.040]  that fanny may freddy mac is solved and we're not going to give it to obama here that's why
[2:50:40.040 --> 2:50:45.720]  they're so pissed off i mean he's doing it he's trying to not drag all the bankers through the
[2:50:45.720 --> 2:50:49.080]  mud because then they'll fight to the death he's trying to just take it away from them
[2:50:49.080 --> 2:50:52.920]  and do the right thing and i think that's what he's now understanding is they're not going to
[2:50:52.920 --> 2:50:58.200]  stop he has to crush them he has to destroy them plus it's the right thing to do so
[2:50:58.200 --> 2:51:00.200]  so
[2:51:28.280 --> 2:51:32.680]  to check out their patent pity technology in these uncertain times it makes sense to have

[3:00:57.880 --> 3:01:02.760]  don't want it to then be used against you and i i just just just get your agenda cut the taxes
[3:01:02.760 --> 3:01:06.360]  and defend the questions that are being murdered he goes i will i will have it not been keeping my
[3:01:06.360 --> 3:01:11.880]  promise and i said absolutely sir i just said you're they'll misrepresent what i've said they
[3:01:11.880 --> 3:01:18.360]  take some out of context i've done and i just said uh let's just let's just hold off see i didn't
[3:01:18.360 --> 3:01:22.040]  have donald trump on when he was ready to come on the next week when he called up and talked to my
[3:01:22.040 --> 3:01:26.600]  wife for five minutes told her stuff i won't say off record that's the kind of guy he i didn't even
[3:01:26.600 --> 3:01:30.680]  call trump say i was getting married no one knew it was a secret i'm telling you about it right now
[3:01:30.680 --> 3:01:36.920]  i was in hawaii and donald trump called me that's the kind of guy donald trump is and i said sir
[3:01:36.920 --> 3:01:42.600]  you don't need to come on the show i okay i believe they might i just said i'm not a hundred percent
[3:01:42.600 --> 3:01:48.360]  sure in my gut that's the right thing he said no let's do it i told you i said no he said all right
[3:01:48.360 --> 3:01:56.040]  all right well see who else you think does that with donald trump nobody nobody so the media can
[3:01:56.040 --> 3:02:01.000]  stick that in their pipe and smoke it i don't need donald trump even though i admire him and
[3:02:01.000 --> 3:02:06.680]  think he's a great guy i don't need msm i turned down the view i said maybe if you do it on
[3:02:06.680 --> 3:02:11.960]  satellite but i'm not coming there i'll do i turned down charlie rose i turned down hbo shows i've
[3:02:11.960 --> 3:02:19.000]  turned down more than 50 reality tv shows do you understand the pleasure i have not in an arrogance
[3:02:19.560 --> 3:02:24.440]  but just in down home realness to tell them you distort you lie i don't need you
[3:02:26.200 --> 3:02:34.440]  i don't need you i don't want you so that's how this works now i get it though he goes on the
[3:02:34.440 --> 3:02:38.280]  lester holst the people that attack him he goes on all these other programs and they sit there and
[3:02:38.280 --> 3:02:43.160]  try to earn points with the establishment they go after his own people do it and you look at you go
[3:02:43.160 --> 3:02:49.400]  why is he having his bigger supporters in there and trump's trying to get people in the establishment
[3:02:49.400 --> 3:02:53.720]  to come over to americana he's trying to recruit him he's trying to win like he's doing you know
[3:02:53.720 --> 3:03:00.040]  against another corporation he's learning though it's not working because there's such scum so i do
[3:03:00.040 --> 3:03:05.400]  agree he should give more exclusive interviews to independent media to my reporters say or other
[3:03:05.400 --> 3:03:10.040]  peoples and they should let more press in there and he should kick out the corporate press so so i
[3:03:10.040 --> 3:03:17.240]  do hear what you're saying but it's up to us the american people people the world to support
[3:03:17.240 --> 3:03:25.960]  nationalism and sovereignty it's not even so much up to trump he's important he's powerful but without
[3:03:25.960 --> 3:03:33.160]  us he's nothing just like without you i'm nothing so the truth is i told the president
[3:03:35.800 --> 3:03:39.480]  i'm like down the road sometime once we've gotten you know the biggest end of three please come on
[3:03:39.480 --> 3:03:43.720]  and he's like well how about how about soon how about yeah i'm gonna come on how about next week
[3:03:43.720 --> 3:03:48.520]  sir i'm not sure that that'd be good you know i've said a lot of things and lost a lot of context and
[3:03:50.520 --> 3:03:53.720]  maybe i just i'm just not sure about that he just paused he's like
[3:03:53.720 --> 3:04:01.560]  mm-hmm see see how that works it isn't about me it's about victory it's about defeating the
[3:04:01.560 --> 3:04:07.800]  globalist and quite frankly maybe it'd be good just to have trump on because it's all about
[3:04:07.800 --> 3:04:12.520]  defeating them throwing it in their face destroying them showing how they don't care they try to
[3:04:12.520 --> 3:04:17.080]  demonize me they try to say i'm a horrible person they try to lie about me then it still fails they
[3:04:17.080 --> 3:04:21.560]  still can't destroy our audience they still can't rid of our listeners we still go on so maybe
[3:04:21.560 --> 3:04:27.720]  see in that moment i was hesitating scared that they would use me against trump but maybe
[3:04:27.720 --> 3:04:32.280]  he's right that he needs to be radical and out there in the open and show what a joke they are
[3:04:32.280 --> 3:04:39.400]  and call them out did i make the wrong decision and i went with my gut my spirit said no don't
[3:04:39.400 --> 3:04:46.120]  have done on trump on next week don't do it because they've already sat there and and hurt him
[3:04:46.760 --> 3:04:50.760]  by taking more radical things i've said in a context but then that kind of gives them the
[3:04:50.760 --> 3:04:55.240]  power they're always going to lie anyway so i don't know it's one of those things were actually
[3:04:55.240 --> 3:05:20.600]  kind of not sure but i i made the decision we'll be back with your calls stay there
[3:05:25.560 --> 3:05:29.960]  this after insinuating that anti-vaccine people are responsible for a measles outbreak in a
[3:05:29.960 --> 3:05:35.480]  somali community in minnesota this story claims as fact vaccines don't cause autism when some have
[3:05:35.480 --> 3:05:39.880]  it already listed as a side effect of course the irony of their statement regarding hanging people
[3:05:39.880 --> 3:05:44.520]  who lie about the health and safety of children is it ultimately would fall back on them if they
[3:05:44.520 --> 3:05:49.560]  do indeed promote the idea that vaccines cannot be linked to autism a blatant lie about the health
[3:05:49.560 --> 3:05:54.200]  and safety of children my guess is this same editorial staff would support abortion but
[3:05:54.200 --> 3:05:59.480]  somehow they don't believe that is a threat to the lives and safety of children for info wars.com

[3:09:11.080 --> 3:09:19.160]  our own show david night roger stone that's just a few months away uh but i want to put a little
[3:09:19.160 --> 3:09:21.160]  in cap on the whole trump thing i was talking about
[3:09:24.360 --> 3:09:29.800]  when trump called me up without me even knowing he knew that i'd gotten married remarried because
[3:09:29.800 --> 3:09:34.760]  then it was a secret i had a divorce three years ago i tried to keep my kids out of it i was remarried
[3:09:34.760 --> 3:09:37.160]  i was on my honeymoon in hawaii
[3:09:39.800 --> 3:09:46.600]  and the phone rings and it's president trump congratulating me because one of our mutual
[3:09:46.600 --> 3:09:52.280]  friends had told him and i had a nice conversation with him he talked to my wife quite a while
[3:09:52.280 --> 3:09:59.000]  i'm gonna tell you stuff he told her it's pretty pretty awesome but long story short very charming
[3:09:59.000 --> 3:10:03.800]  very hardworking guy he was like well we gotta do the show soon i keep telling you well let's do it
[3:10:03.800 --> 3:10:08.040]  the next few weeks and i said sir i i just i don't know they're gonna try to use stuff upside
[3:10:08.040 --> 3:10:12.680]  out of context maybe it's not the best because oh really it's not a problem i said no no i want
[3:10:12.680 --> 3:10:17.640]  you on but you got too much work to do sir and i said once you've defeated them and you know once
[3:10:17.640 --> 3:10:23.160]  we've totally dominated you know then please come on but i just you know you're being so loyal i just
[3:10:23.160 --> 3:10:26.760]  think you're doing this out of pure loyalty and i think deep down you know it's probably this is
[3:10:26.760 --> 3:10:32.920]  exact conversation probably not the best thing and he goes i think he said some things i'm gonna
[3:10:32.920 --> 3:10:42.200]  leave it right there but that's why i like trump is that he's so loyal that even though he knows
[3:10:42.200 --> 3:10:46.520]  he gets attacked and everything else he would come on my show out of loyalty and then out of
[3:10:46.520 --> 3:10:51.880]  loyalty i'd say no you're not coming on the show and i only say that now so people get an understanding
[3:10:51.880 --> 3:11:00.440]  of how cool donald john trump is i noticed in one thing they got right out of a bunch of bull
[3:11:00.440 --> 3:11:03.400]  they had a couple things right that buzzfeed piece we followed me around for three months
[3:11:03.960 --> 3:11:08.040]  was that i am incredibly loyal and a super nice guy until you screwed me and then i'm
[3:11:08.040 --> 3:11:13.880]  very vindictive no i'm not vindictive i cut you out of my life and then these people
[3:11:16.120 --> 3:11:20.360]  who get cut out of my life then bitch it means i don't stand bend over to be abused
[3:11:22.920 --> 3:11:27.560]  and that's the problem here is that good people in america have gotten to the point where we put
[3:11:27.560 --> 3:11:32.760]  up with being abused we put up with being pushed around we put up with crap all day because we're
[3:11:32.760 --> 3:11:38.440]  the good guys well here's the deal if you're good people i'll give you my shirt but if you're
[3:11:38.440 --> 3:11:44.600]  some parasite piece of crap liar i'll do everything i can to make sure everybody knows what a piece of
[3:11:44.600 --> 3:11:50.360]  garbage you are and that you're not going to be part of polite society anymore i forget the guest
[3:11:50.360 --> 3:11:55.560]  was we had a month on there was some guest we had on like a month ago who said christians
[3:11:55.560 --> 3:11:57.960]  are too tolerant
[3:12:00.360 --> 3:12:05.000]  or too tolerant of radical muslims or too tolerant all these groups that won't stop until we're
[3:12:05.000 --> 3:12:10.120]  eradicated they're out to get us well here's the deal we're not out to get them but we're not getting
[3:12:10.120 --> 3:12:17.800]  them aid or comfort or sucker you're not getting anything from us but a hand a cold hand you go
[3:12:17.800 --> 3:12:22.600]  back to your third world hellholes you go back to your monotheistic oppression of women you go back
[3:12:22.600 --> 3:12:28.200]  to your stone age crap and you leave the renaissance and classical liberalism and thomas jefferson
[3:12:28.200 --> 3:12:34.440]  and space travel and medicine and the arts and classical music and everything the west has to
[3:12:34.440 --> 3:12:44.760]  offer you don't like it then you don't get any part of it and so humanity's finding its guts again
[3:12:44.760 --> 3:12:49.960]  its heart its soul and the world can't stand it we'll get ready because the sleeping giant
[3:12:49.960 --> 3:12:57.640]  is an idea and it's rising and anybody no matter where they're from or what color they are
[3:13:00.280 --> 3:13:09.000]  can be part of it and it'll replace all the other gangs all the other bs systems all the fake
[3:13:09.000 --> 3:13:17.800]  religions its competition its free market it's a college of open debate and ideas its empowerment
[3:13:17.800 --> 3:13:23.400]  it's common sense and it's here and it's waiting for you now i want to go back to your phone calls for
[3:13:25.560 --> 3:13:31.240]  matthew and joe and sunday and others have been holding them and i want to have o insurer
[3:13:31.240 --> 3:13:36.280]  finish the rest of the hour but i wanted to hit a little topic here first oh and with you on putin
[3:13:37.240 --> 3:13:41.480]  and i'm sure you gave it to me but will you guys print me the speech on teddy roosevelt just a
[3:13:41.480 --> 3:13:46.680]  short part about the man in the arena because i want to read that part of the poem uh or statement
[3:13:46.680 --> 3:13:51.160]  but but just looking at comey we have a prescript of this we don't prescript things what is your
[3:13:51.160 --> 3:13:55.960]  overall view of this because even lester holt has to admit trump's got a point that every major
[3:13:55.960 --> 3:14:00.600]  democrat out there said fire comey even last week and now they're acting like they never said it i mean
[3:14:00.600 --> 3:14:06.360]  this is crazy bill clinton fired an fbi director when bill clinton had been foster killed and people
[3:14:06.360 --> 3:14:10.600]  said nothing well this fbi guy said that trump wasn't even under investigation but i get why
[3:14:10.600 --> 3:14:16.280]  comey said he was surprised and thought it was a joke because the truth is he really hadn't
[3:14:16.280 --> 3:14:21.400]  gone after trump trump just didn't like him because he was a weasel go ahead well i don't
[3:14:21.400 --> 3:14:26.520]  know if this is trump's doing or the democrats just doing this to themselves but as you talked
[3:14:26.520 --> 3:14:32.920]  about earlier trump has an amazing way of either sending out a tweet or making a policy change or
[3:14:32.920 --> 3:14:38.360]  making a statement or firing somebody like comey and just exposing the democrats that want to stop
[3:14:38.360 --> 3:14:45.080]  him as total hypocrites total double standard politicians and it really just proves that
[3:14:45.080 --> 3:14:49.880]  they're the ones guilty of partisan politics and it doesn't matter what trump does even if it's good
[3:14:49.880 --> 3:14:54.200]  for everyone on the face of the earth no matter what they're still going to be against it so
[3:14:54.200 --> 3:15:00.200]  trump fires comey doesn't even have to do anything doesn't even have to address the democrats doesn't
[3:15:00.200 --> 3:15:05.240]  even have to ask chuck schumer for a comment or maxine water for a comment they do it on their own
[3:15:05.240 --> 3:15:11.080]  they go on television shows uh you know so whatever trump i don't know again i don't know if trump
[3:15:11.080 --> 3:15:16.120]  does this on purpose or if the democrats are just doing this to themselves but it's amazing
[3:15:16.120 --> 3:15:22.520]  how they will come out in broad daylight and just be blatant hypocrites it's undebatable
[3:15:22.520 --> 3:15:28.040]  it's not even questionable it's black and white now alex so it'll be interesting to see how the
[3:15:28.040 --> 3:15:33.640]  democrats survive this and i think more people are coming over to trump now i agree the polls
[3:15:33.640 --> 3:15:38.680]  but the good news is as trump always says winning fixes everything and that's fundamentally trump
[3:15:38.680 --> 3:15:44.680]  wants win-win situations he wants prosperity the globalists want austerity that's why they hate him
[3:15:44.680 --> 3:15:49.000]  did you see his letter to comey that if you spell it out it says i win it's at the real alex jones
[3:15:49.000 --> 3:15:52.920]  on twitter yeah there's there's weird stuff with some of these letters there was one that bill
[3:15:52.920 --> 3:15:57.880]  clinton sent out also that said help me maybe because uh he's being held hostage by hillary
[3:15:57.880 --> 3:16:02.920]  but you know alex think about this with the whole russia thing okay this all comes from the same
[3:16:02.920 --> 3:16:08.200]  group of people now james clapper again goes on television today and talks about a cloud over
[3:16:08.200 --> 3:16:12.280]  trump a cloud there's a cloud over trump alex this is the guy that lied and said the nsa never
[3:16:12.280 --> 3:16:16.280]  spotted on these settings oh right there's a cloud over trump but hold on let's talk about
[3:16:16.280 --> 3:16:22.120]  the bureaucracy that james clapper represented this is the same bureaucracy that told us that it was a
[3:16:22.120 --> 3:16:29.000]  north vietnamese ship that sunk our ship in the gulf of tonkin got us into war a lie this is the same
[3:16:29.000 --> 3:16:35.880]  bureaucracy that told us one rifleman and a magic bullet is responsible for killing jfk a lie this is
[3:16:35.880 --> 3:16:41.080]  the same bureaucracy that told us that saddam hussein had weapons of mass destruction sent us
[3:16:41.080 --> 3:16:46.040]  into war destroyed the middle east we're still not out of there a lie the same bureaucracy that
[3:16:46.040 --> 3:16:51.320]  told us it was syria that used chemical weapons against their own people a lie that's been exposed
[3:16:51.320 --> 3:16:57.320]  what is the most recent one trump russia this is the big lie alex this is the big lie i don't know
[3:16:57.320 --> 3:17:01.320]  if impeaching trump is what the end goal here is or if they have other end goals or they're really
[3:17:01.320 --> 3:17:06.920]  just that big of babies but this is the big latest lie to come out of our corrupt government
[3:17:06.920 --> 3:17:12.760]  just like all the other ones alex and we see it now the people see it i totally agree with you
[3:17:12.760 --> 3:17:17.320]  and as did you see oberman saying foreign governments help overthrow trump when you
[3:17:17.320 --> 3:17:21.080]  actually ask for foreign governments to overthrow your government that's called high treason that's
[3:17:21.080 --> 3:17:27.640]  executable i mean he's so he's so and he and like pechenek said he takes all the terms we use
[3:17:27.640 --> 3:17:32.440]  and then turns them around and puts them in this teleprompter alex we're libertarians okay we are
[3:17:32.440 --> 3:17:37.320]  constitutionalists and we don't want people to get locked up we don't want people's free speech
[3:17:37.320 --> 3:17:43.880]  to be squandered no we we enjoy the constitution we support free speech we love it but it comes to
[3:17:43.880 --> 3:17:48.920]  a point where you have to ask yourself me seriously these people belong in a mental institution
[3:17:48.920 --> 3:17:53.560]  okay they either belong in a mental institution or as you just pointed out they're guilty of
[3:17:53.560 --> 3:17:59.480]  high treason alex we can't just sit here then have ludicrous people making ludicrous statements
[3:17:59.480 --> 3:18:03.720]  here's what i've never said overthrow the government finally i've never said have foreign
[3:18:03.720 --> 3:18:08.120]  intelligence involved what we're doing and they're calling for me to be locked up because i told schiff
[3:18:08.120 --> 3:18:11.560]  metaphorically you get in my face call me a communist agent i'll punch you in the nose don't
[3:18:11.560 --> 3:18:16.280]  mean that literally it's like dude stop lying about me with no proof bring me to congress
[3:18:17.240 --> 3:18:23.000]  show your proof meanwhile they're constantly saying kill trump the black lives matter is funded by
[3:18:23.000 --> 3:18:27.960]  sorrows saying kill cops and people go oh what you want to kiss cops but yeah i don't want to
[3:18:27.960 --> 3:18:33.640]  randomly have cops who are like pulling somebody over or changing a tire or pumping gas be shot in
[3:18:33.640 --> 3:18:39.480]  the back yeah i'm not for randomly killing black people hispanics white people uh native americans
[3:18:40.120 --> 3:18:45.400]  school teachers cops anybody you can't just randomly say let's just kill white people
[3:18:45.400 --> 3:18:50.520]  like this black professor saying i mean at a fundamental level i hear this black professor
[3:18:50.520 --> 3:18:54.440]  up at a and m saying it's time to start killing some white people and at a fundamental level it's
[3:18:54.440 --> 3:18:58.280]  like man it's not because he's black it's because the guy running his mouth he looks like he ate a
[3:18:58.280 --> 3:19:02.200]  bunch of white people he's so fat maybe he's been eating five or six of them at a fundamental level
[3:19:02.200 --> 3:19:07.000]  as a man like let's go protest the kkk they didn't even go that far i want to like dude here i am
[3:19:07.000 --> 3:19:11.880]  you want to kill me let's go you run your big fat mouth all day long here here's a meat cleaver
[3:19:11.880 --> 3:19:17.800]  i got one too here one calling for death let's go i mean what the hell's his problem alex i understand
[3:19:17.800 --> 3:19:23.960]  your frustration keith oberman is now the most cringe worthy person in media and that is saying
[3:19:23.960 --> 3:19:29.000]  a ton you're talking about chunk yogurt who hasn't had a suit that fits him right since he
[3:19:29.000 --> 3:19:35.800]  located the donut shop okay you've got uh people that go on mbc like andrea michael just horrible
[3:19:35.800 --> 3:19:40.280]  she gets trolled by russians every time that she tries to rudely ask him a question and now
[3:19:40.280 --> 3:19:46.280]  keith oberman is quite literally the worst person in media and a and m is so liberal now
[3:19:46.280 --> 3:19:51.080]  used to be like a military college but back yeah my grandfather went there i asked that they won't
[3:19:51.080 --> 3:19:57.240]  they won't even firing when this guy looks like he ate five white people he looks like he's 17 years
[3:19:57.240 --> 3:20:01.000]  old and he's up there talking about how we got to kill the white people it's like dude what if
[3:20:01.000 --> 3:20:06.360]  somebody goes god forbid and kills him and says we need to kill some black people it's like it's
[3:20:06.360 --> 3:20:10.600]  like what is it i don't want to kill any black people i'm trying to stop why doesn't this dumb
[3:20:10.600 --> 3:20:14.520]  ass say stop aborting half the black people i'm actually have black people on that don't want
[3:20:14.520 --> 3:20:19.240]  abort black people or white people why don't we stop aborting half the black babies uh oh and
[3:20:19.240 --> 3:20:24.440]  i actually care about the black babies i don't want to kill black people but this guy this guy is an
[3:20:24.440 --> 3:20:32.120]  asshole excuse me excuse me it's uh it goes beyond that alex he's not just um he's not just a jerk
[3:20:32.120 --> 3:20:35.880]  he is mentally deranged he really has he looks like he ate four or five white people well and
[3:20:35.880 --> 3:20:39.000]  that's but this is all of them that's what i'm saying you know they catch great white sharks
[3:20:39.000 --> 3:20:42.680]  to cut him up to see if like they've eaten somebody i'm worried there may be some white
[3:20:42.680 --> 3:20:47.400]  people in there can we show pictures of it and it wouldn't even matter if they didn't have their
[3:20:47.400 --> 3:20:52.040]  little minions that actually exist i mean these people actually have a following i don't know how
[3:20:52.040 --> 3:20:56.520]  but they they still have a following alex and i think that that i think i'm going to watch
[3:20:56.520 --> 3:20:59.720]  his twitter and facebook and stuff and i think we should all go up there when he's at some speech
[3:20:59.720 --> 3:21:04.360]  or go to his class and you just say hey we're here you won't kill people i mean well it'd be
[3:21:04.360 --> 3:21:08.360]  interesting to see you know if he wants to retract that statement i don't believe that he's made any
[3:21:08.360 --> 3:21:13.560]  retraction of that offensive statement the university has decided to keep him under the employee
[3:21:13.560 --> 3:21:18.200]  but it's just this madness alex is this it's this madness that's going on right now for all the
[3:21:18.200 --> 3:21:22.920]  people that fell for all the fake news about trump they cannot believe the reality they're in they
[3:21:22.920 --> 3:21:32.760]  cannot wrap their minds around it literally they are completely just drowning in fake news alex
[3:21:32.760 --> 3:21:39.400]  trump and i want to know why he's allowed to eat white people how about this you've got this guy
[3:21:39.400 --> 3:21:45.880]  going on at the university of texas a&m okay calling for white people to be killed but alex
[3:21:45.880 --> 3:21:51.320]  here's a story that seems to be going without any coverage now bernie sanders he's going to talk he
[3:21:51.320 --> 3:21:56.600]  also said white people don't know what it's like to be poor white people don't know what it's like
[3:21:56.600 --> 3:22:01.560]  to be poor yeah the dumbest thing he's ever said possibly but hold on though he's all about getting
[3:22:01.560 --> 3:22:07.400]  the truth out about this fbi investigation and uh into trump and russia right he's all about that but
[3:22:07.400 --> 3:22:14.280]  hold on his wife is under fbi investigation that's when my banks that's right bernie sanders wife
[3:22:14.280 --> 3:22:20.680]  jane sanders falsified loan documents while she served as the president of burlington college my
[3:22:20.680 --> 3:22:25.800]  wife doesn't know what it's like to be poor alex because he swindled so much damn money alex this
[3:22:25.800 --> 3:22:30.680]  is amazing i have people that i've gotten into debates with that are that are friends of mine
[3:22:30.680 --> 3:22:36.200]  that are liberals they're real liberals okay they live in reality but they are liberals and they
[3:22:36.200 --> 3:22:40.920]  they do at some points enjoy bernie sanders and some of the policies that come out of him and
[3:22:40.920 --> 3:22:46.600]  whatnot of the left but even they are seeing this now even they are like this is a joke man
[3:22:47.320 --> 3:22:51.720]  bernie sanders was a fraud too who to well his wife also i think may have eaten like 15 white
[3:22:51.720 --> 3:22:56.440]  people who does the left have left alex they have nothing that's why they're so desperate for the rock
[3:22:56.440 --> 3:23:01.400]  or for oprah or for mark zuckerberg to come out and run for president because they have nothing
[3:23:02.040 --> 3:23:08.040]  all of their politicians are losers man they are losers they're about to swindlers can't even get
[3:23:08.040 --> 3:23:15.160]  a job until he's what 30 and he gets elected or some crap can you imagine if the rock runs with
[3:23:15.160 --> 3:23:20.520]  zuckerberg you know it's interesting alex i know you've talked to people within the wwe it's it's
[3:23:20.520 --> 3:23:26.120]  pretty well known the wwe is a pretty conservative group politically considering uh the people that
[3:23:26.120 --> 3:23:31.000]  go out on media and do interviews you've got linda mcman who's in as a small business advisor or
[3:23:31.000 --> 3:23:36.440]  administration advisor uh vince wickman's wife right so the billionaire is struggling and like
[3:23:36.440 --> 3:23:40.840]  you said earlier um i i i don't have a problem with the rock i think the rock is a genuine guy i
[3:23:40.840 --> 3:23:45.080]  think he genuinely cares about people i just know i like all the shows he's on i mean i won't watch a
[3:23:45.080 --> 3:23:49.880]  lot of tv and yeah he's just really funny to watch i like him and i can't if he runs with the democrats
[3:23:49.880 --> 3:23:55.720]  oh uh huh well apparently they say he's a registered republican i don't know if that's true or not i
[3:23:55.720 --> 3:23:59.160]  hope that's the case because the word is zuckerberg's trying to get him to run i think that i well i
[3:23:59.160 --> 3:24:04.280]  think that that's what they're gonna try to do alex they know that the rock has people power i mean
[3:24:04.280 --> 3:24:09.000]  he you know he's the people's champion is what they call him and they know that he will draw a lot
[3:24:09.000 --> 3:24:13.560]  of attention he's already drawing attention just for the notion that he might run and the democrats
[3:24:13.560 --> 3:24:19.640]  have nothing they have literally nothing who kory booker tried that failed elizabeth waran well
[3:24:19.640 --> 3:24:25.400]  known liar failed bernie sanders cuck to hillary clinton failed joe biden i don't know if he's gonna
[3:24:25.400 --> 3:24:31.000]  last that much longer not gonna work for him they have nothing they have nothing they got this kamala
[3:24:31.000 --> 3:24:36.520]  harris out in california drops an f-bomb during a public event alex i was trying to act young and
[3:24:36.520 --> 3:24:42.200]  i also love how other democrats go out and say stay woke my millennials let's go to some paul waters
[3:24:42.200 --> 3:24:48.040]  that's what i'm saying alex this isn't this isn't you or i just having a talk show and just throwing
[3:24:48.040 --> 3:24:54.280]  out rhetoric to get me maxine waters belongs in a mental institution okay by the way since you
[3:24:54.280 --> 3:24:57.960]  mentioned it we're gonna come out from break i'm gonna let you get to this because i don't take
[3:24:57.960 --> 3:25:01.000]  over the whole hour you're doing here i want to be here but i don't want to hog everything
[3:25:01.000 --> 3:25:05.000]  we've got a bunch of collars i want to go to them we have this maxine waters of the name of the
[3:25:05.000 --> 3:25:11.080]  joke video is maxine waters talking in circles on whether coming should be fired that's that's one
[3:25:11.080 --> 3:25:17.400]  important video but there's another one that the guys put together which shows maxine waters maxine
[3:25:17.400 --> 3:25:21.720]  waters has evidence of trump russia collusion i want to play that we come out of break but right now
[3:25:21.720 --> 3:25:27.480]  listen all along this math you and the great street of alabama come on down math you
[3:25:28.840 --> 3:25:33.000]  hey thanks for having me on i've been listening for about two years and um y'all have really
[3:25:33.000 --> 3:25:36.440]  changed my perception of what media can be like thanks for putting up with us go ahead
[3:25:38.040 --> 3:25:42.920]  um i'm a gay trump supporter from alabama and i'm also a christian um despite what media would
[3:25:42.920 --> 3:25:49.560]  have you believe i'm a gay trump supporter too so it's all right well and uh 24 years in alabama
[3:25:49.560 --> 3:25:54.680]  i've never witnessed a prejudice or racism around here um it's a pretty good place to live um but
[3:25:54.680 --> 3:25:59.400]  you know the media just drives me nuts and uh when people like steven colbert and oberman when they
[3:25:59.400 --> 3:26:05.400]  accused trump of like not theism fascism and just things like that it's crazy because honestly
[3:26:05.400 --> 3:26:11.480]  republicans are the opposite of things like that and i mean i grew up kind of as a i mean parents
[3:26:11.480 --> 3:26:15.400]  weren't super right when republicans they were republicans it was never anything racist in fact
[3:26:15.400 --> 3:26:19.400]  i think it was white guilt but but like you know a nice white guilt i like the crazy type white
[3:26:19.400 --> 3:26:23.400]  guilt and then democrats i get around them that's where i hear the right stuff and i'm just being
[3:26:23.400 --> 3:26:28.120]  honest here i totally agree with you it's like they've distorted reality and but there's a big
[3:26:28.120 --> 3:26:32.520]  difference there i mean with colbert he's fake news everybody knows steven colbert is fake news
[3:26:32.520 --> 3:26:36.360]  he's a jokester he's a prankster he's a joke himself okay now the stuff he says isn't real
[3:26:36.360 --> 3:26:42.280]  but he hides behind it but keith oberman is actually posing as the savior of the republic
[3:26:42.280 --> 3:26:47.160]  he's out there ranting and raving like the republic is real saviors overthrow trump
[3:26:48.440 --> 3:26:52.360]  that's why keith oberman ticks me off more than anything else alex because he is the biggest
[3:26:52.360 --> 3:26:57.720]  fake out there because he pretends to be real colbert you know is fake oberman pretends to be real
[3:26:58.600 --> 3:27:04.200]  amazing mathy what else is on your mind i just wonder is there a point since i've had friends
[3:27:04.200 --> 3:27:09.400]  that have out honestly gotten upset when i pointed out that steven colbert is a comedy show they just
[3:27:09.400 --> 3:27:15.560]  don't understand that he's not and then they exactly they'll say oh he's not comedy but he's not real
[3:27:15.560 --> 3:27:23.000]  so you shouldn't get so upset but is there a point that these people aren't they inciting chaos aren't
[3:27:23.000 --> 3:27:28.760]  they committing defamate defamation slander they're they're even contradicting what the cia and fbi
[3:27:28.760 --> 3:27:33.000]  are saying you know it's true they're just look that's a good question thanks for the call matthew
[3:27:33.000 --> 3:27:37.320]  oh and they really are getting hysterical now and calling for murder death overthrow
[3:27:37.320 --> 3:27:42.840]  so do we just ignore them because if we if the government does something it turns them into
[3:27:42.840 --> 3:27:48.200]  victims but they deserve or they're calling for killing the president or they're calling
[3:27:48.200 --> 3:27:52.120]  for foreign governments to overthrow them i mean you can't just let people do that well alex i'm
[3:27:52.120 --> 3:27:57.000]  seeing jeff sessions right now really focusing on the war on drugs i'm kind of getting sick of it
[3:27:57.000 --> 3:28:01.080]  to be honest with you i'd like to see his attention elsewhere and i think the war on commies and i
[3:28:01.080 --> 3:28:06.520]  think that that right there what you talked about needs to be jeff sessions duty jeff sessions should
[3:28:06.520 --> 3:28:11.000]  be the one saying hey look if you're gonna make a threat against the president of the united states
[3:28:11.000 --> 3:28:15.480]  on social media or anywhere we're gonna look into you that doesn't mean we're gonna arrest you that
[3:28:15.480 --> 3:28:19.160]  doesn't mean you're necessarily doing anything illegal but guess what we're not just gonna allow
[3:28:19.160 --> 3:28:22.920]  this to happen anymore wait a minute you say kill the president you need to spend a year i mean
[3:28:22.920 --> 3:28:26.760]  come on you need to go okay but that's but who's who's doing that who's monitoring this whose job
[3:28:26.760 --> 3:28:30.840]  is it it should be jeff sessions sessions is too busy worrying about how to keep people hey i'm sick
[3:28:30.840 --> 3:28:35.400]  of them saying kill me i want somebody to get in trouble i've never done this exactly so why don't
[3:28:35.400 --> 3:28:40.520]  they focus on that but you know alex think about this we talked about fake news and that caller
[3:28:40.520 --> 3:28:49.320]  just made a point that made me think about this so it comes out that after trump fires comey a
[3:28:49.320 --> 3:28:54.760]  fake news story comes out that says this happens after comey asked for more funding into the
[3:28:54.760 --> 3:28:59.160]  russia investigation turns out that wasn't so it turns out that's fake news so we have to sit here
[3:28:59.160 --> 3:29:03.800]  as americans and think about this we cannot just let this go away first came out in the washington
[3:29:03.800 --> 3:29:10.360]  post okay so who made this up this is literally a made-up story that comes out of the washington
[3:29:10.360 --> 3:29:15.960]  compost why is nobody asking about this did somebody inside the washington compost make this up was
[3:29:15.960 --> 3:29:22.040]  there a fake leak perhaps donald trump himself is testing the waters and giving fake intel to people
[3:29:22.040 --> 3:29:27.080]  to see where the leaks are nobody's talking about this how does fake news just get created
[3:29:27.080 --> 3:29:32.360]  and in the media who's quote unquote watching fake news really just watching us doesn't even care
[3:29:32.360 --> 3:29:36.040]  all right oh and you got a bunch of callers and a bunch of clips we're gonna come back and play
[3:29:36.040 --> 3:29:40.120]  this maxine waters clip and we're gonna go right to your phone calls i'm punching out until sunday

[3:29:56.440 --> 3:30:07.320]  so today i want to talk about killing white people in context a texas a and m professor says
[3:30:07.320 --> 3:30:15.800]  that some white people may have to die in order to solve racism and bring about true equality
[3:30:15.800 --> 3:30:19.720]  when we have this conversation about violence or killing white people it has to be looked at in
[3:30:19.720 --> 3:30:24.280]  this kind of historical term and the fact that we've had no one address like how relevant and how
[3:30:24.280 --> 3:30:29.080]  solidified this kind of tradition is for black people saying look in order to be equal in order
[3:30:29.080 --> 3:30:34.440]  to be liberated some white people may have to die that was professor tommy curry on the ready news
[3:30:34.440 --> 3:30:41.800]  review podcast who went on to say that the movie jango unchained made killing white people look fun
[3:30:41.800 --> 3:30:49.320]  but in reality it should be part of a serious discussion so far it is unknown if law enforcement
[3:30:49.320 --> 3:30:56.520]  officials or homeland security are investigating tommy curry for his violent racist and terroristic
[3:30:56.520 --> 3:31:02.360]  threats and you can learn more right now at info wars dot com hey everyone farms has been fuchs

[3:33:06.360 --> 3:33:29.800]  if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance you're listening to alex jones
[3:33:36.360 --> 3:33:57.800]  you have an investigation going on where the president is implicated does intelligence exist
[3:33:58.600 --> 3:34:02.040]  that can definitively answer the following question whether there were improper contacts
[3:34:02.040 --> 3:34:08.280]  between the trump campaign and russian officials we did not include any evidence in our report
[3:34:08.280 --> 3:34:14.920]  and i say our that's nsa fbi and cia with my office the director of national intelligence
[3:34:15.960 --> 3:34:21.560]  that had anything that had any reflection of collusion between members of the trump campaign
[3:34:21.560 --> 3:34:25.800]  and the russians there was no evidence of that included in in our report i understand that but
[3:34:25.800 --> 3:34:33.080]  does it exist not to my knowledge and this is a serious investigation i've been trying to get
[3:34:33.080 --> 3:34:39.240]  people to focus on this connection with the kremlin and with putin do you have evidence
[3:34:39.240 --> 3:34:46.760]  that there was in fact collusion between trump associates and russia during the campaign not at
[3:34:46.760 --> 3:34:53.000]  this time i think there's enough there that we know about the kremlin and about putin to be
[3:34:53.000 --> 3:35:00.040]  concerned about whether or not there was collusion well as i stated i don't know of any evidence of
[3:35:00.040 --> 3:35:07.240]  that was mr clapper wrong when he said that i think he's right about characterizing the report
[3:35:07.240 --> 3:35:13.960]  which you all have read so to be clear you think and i believe that they should have to connect the
[3:35:13.960 --> 3:35:19.800]  dots and get the facts because i think it will lead to the impeachment of this president can you
[3:35:19.800 --> 3:35:24.920]  say definitively that there was collusion there were people affiliated with the trump campaign
[3:35:24.920 --> 3:35:30.840]  who were working with russians i don't think we can say anything definitively at this point
[3:35:30.840 --> 3:35:35.640]  you keep saying there's a lot more smoke there's a lot more you think the fire is there well
[3:35:35.640 --> 3:35:42.200]  time will tell everybody go at this investigation until we get to the facts into the bottom line
[3:35:42.200 --> 3:35:48.840]  which was their conclusion i believe that there was i had no uh evidence of what was presented to
[3:35:48.840 --> 3:35:56.840]  me of of collusion now have you seen anything either intelligence briefings through intelligence
[3:35:56.840 --> 3:36:04.760]  briefings anything to back up any of the accusations that sure they have the documentation that they did
[3:36:04.760 --> 3:36:10.600]  the hacking the hacking on the dnc right and on some of us you know but the collusion though no we
[3:36:10.600 --> 3:36:20.360]  have not was that conclusion i believe that there was the collusion though no we have not we accept
[3:36:20.360 --> 3:36:27.080]  the truth and buck the system and the group collective do that and you'll learn your way
[3:36:27.080 --> 3:36:42.200]  that as well this is the info war so there you go there's maxine waters piped in with a little
[3:36:42.840 --> 3:36:47.160]  james clapper just being a total you know i would say she's a fraud but i really think
[3:36:47.160 --> 3:36:53.000]  that she's just genuinely lost her mind suffering from dementia i mean who knows what chemicals
[3:36:53.000 --> 3:36:58.200]  are on top of that wig that she puts on her head but here's the funny thing here's a story from
[3:36:58.200 --> 3:37:03.240]  daily caller 113 days into the trump presidency and democrats suggest he could be impeached so you
[3:37:03.240 --> 3:37:08.600]  got this list of the democrats who've called for his impeachment maxine waters richard blumenthal
[3:37:08.600 --> 3:37:16.280]  algreen mark polkin jared huffman tulsi gabard hakeem jeffreys i think the list is actually
[3:37:16.280 --> 3:37:20.600]  more than that especially if you added media but nonetheless all these people are calling
[3:37:20.600 --> 3:37:24.600]  for the impeachment of donald trump they've called the impeachment for the impeachment
[3:37:24.600 --> 3:37:28.280]  over all kinds of things the russian is the biggest one trumps a russian agent
[3:37:29.480 --> 3:37:33.000]  but now the last one even though there's no evidence right we're going to impeach president
[3:37:33.000 --> 3:37:39.320]  trump with no evidence whatsoever that makes sense typical but now it's because of the
[3:37:39.320 --> 3:37:47.160]  james comey firing let's recall again all of these democrats said james comey either cost
[3:37:47.160 --> 3:37:52.040]  hillary the election they already called for him to be fired or they said he was incompetent or
[3:37:52.040 --> 3:37:57.640]  obstructing justice now those same people are saying that donald trump needs to be impeached
[3:37:57.640 --> 3:38:04.680]  for obstructing justice when he removed the head of the fbi that the very people calling for trumps
[3:38:04.680 --> 3:38:13.480]  impeachment said was ineffective so trump now needs to be impeached because he wants to actually
[3:38:13.480 --> 3:38:21.480]  restore faith in the fbi's investigation process which the democrats had no faith then when james
[3:38:21.480 --> 3:38:28.200]  comey was there trump wants to restore that faith and they hate him for it it's like i don't even
[3:38:28.200 --> 3:38:30.920]  know it's like i'm beating my head against the wall i can't even believe we deal with these people
[3:38:30.920 --> 3:38:35.080]  i can't even believe i have to talk to these people i can't believe maxine waters gets to go on tv
[3:38:35.080 --> 3:38:39.800]  literally make 180 flip flops in the same segment and still gets to be an official people still
[3:38:39.800 --> 3:38:45.560]  take her seriously it's a joke let's go out to some of the callers here we've got joe in california
[3:38:45.560 --> 3:38:50.200]  i think joe wants to talk about the string of hack attacks or i think it was malware attacks
[3:38:50.200 --> 3:38:55.240]  that happened worldwide today is that what you want to talk about joe yes sir and it's a pleasure
[3:38:55.240 --> 3:39:01.880]  to speak with you mr carla kuck slayer um yeah actually uh the you know these ransomwares i uh i
[3:39:01.880 --> 3:39:08.520]  build a lot of uh network security myself and uh two ways in which these you know this stuff
[3:39:08.520 --> 3:39:14.440]  actually manages to get it one is either through an email right so you get an email they'll say
[3:39:14.440 --> 3:39:20.920]  you have a voicemail you open the attachment and it's an executable um the second method which is
[3:39:20.920 --> 3:39:25.400]  actually more dubious and is even you know i mean i'm even having to wear tinfoil in front of my
[3:39:25.400 --> 3:39:33.720]  team here is uh open remote access ports so for example administrators rather than install a tool
[3:39:33.720 --> 3:39:39.720]  and go in securely they'll just use use basic uh remote desktop protocol to remotely administer
[3:39:39.720 --> 3:39:45.400]  their machines well if that's open on the internet any other idiot who knows those ip addresses can
[3:39:45.400 --> 3:39:50.680]  also get in through there they use you know this is where i guess the nsa tools come into play
[3:39:50.680 --> 3:39:56.520]  is where they manage to essentially just create an account to give you administrative access and
[3:39:56.520 --> 3:40:03.560]  get in i've discovered customers where they a brand new account gets created and this stuff
[3:40:03.560 --> 3:40:07.960]  is on there and they're having to shell out $10,000 so what's the big story though with this attack
[3:40:07.960 --> 3:40:13.480]  today what do you think's going on today with with the uh with the malware that was going down the
[3:40:13.480 --> 3:40:18.760]  story was all around the world this was going on well yeah but yeah but well i mean nhs and a few
[3:40:18.760 --> 3:40:22.280]  others they're cheap and so they don't want to they don't want to lock down their networks
[3:40:22.280 --> 3:40:26.360]  and this is just a new strain i mean that's really that's really what i see it as is it's a new
[3:40:26.360 --> 3:40:32.440]  strain it's a new strain of malware uh and let's keep in mind too that uh president trump uh just
[3:40:32.440 --> 3:40:37.560]  i believe it was he's either signed an executive order or he made some sort of initiative to bolster
[3:40:38.120 --> 3:40:42.280]  the united states cyber security so i wonder if this had anything to do with that hey final words
[3:40:42.280 --> 3:40:47.480]  joe i got to take another call yeah secondarily uh in order to the best way to fight against this
[3:40:47.480 --> 3:40:52.520]  stuff is to have a good backup if you've got your data backed up fine wipe that machine that got hit
[3:40:52.520 --> 3:40:57.560]  and restore your data um if i may speak actually if it's possible about the uh about that guy call
[3:40:57.560 --> 3:41:03.720]  for the killing of all whites right yeah yeah yeah so i mean that that's just racial communism
[3:41:03.720 --> 3:41:08.040]  i mean the communists they couldn't get us versus on class you know well i mean that's just an
[3:41:08.040 --> 3:41:13.880]  absolute that's just an absolute liberal professor who's just clueless about history and just wants
[3:41:13.880 --> 3:41:19.000]  to virtue signal and play the victim all day um you can put whatever phrasing on it you want
[3:41:19.000 --> 3:41:23.400]  and i'm not disagreeing with you thank you for the call joe i just think it it's you know you can't
[3:41:23.400 --> 3:41:32.760]  even to say that it's anything more or less than a mental disorder i think is just giving it too
[3:41:32.760 --> 3:41:37.400]  much credence that's really what it comes down to at the end of the day based on lies let's go to
[3:41:37.400 --> 3:41:44.680]  cindy who wants to talk about keith oberman oh my gosh go ahead cindy hi owen um if the
[3:41:44.680 --> 3:41:50.600]  trump administration wants to do the right thing we've been waiting for years for this they need
[3:41:50.600 --> 3:41:57.960]  to charge keith oberman with open trees and i mean the clintons were guilty of treason obama
[3:41:57.960 --> 3:42:03.960]  was guilty of treason bush was guilty of treason for years i've been sitting and watching all this
[3:42:03.960 --> 3:42:09.880]  open trees yes everywhere yeah and it's it's but it's trump you see but it's trump now
[3:42:09.880 --> 3:42:15.080]  isn't that amazing trump gets in is actually an american president whether you like him or not
[3:42:15.080 --> 3:42:19.320]  he's actually acting as the president of the united states i'm not saying everything he does
[3:42:19.320 --> 3:42:25.560]  is perfect i'm saying he wants to be the president of the united states and and probably the i don't
[3:42:25.560 --> 3:42:29.720]  know i haven't found anything i could say that donald trump is guilty of treason with um
[3:42:31.000 --> 3:42:36.360]  but these other presidents as you just said it's like hand over fist treason non-stop
[3:42:36.360 --> 3:42:42.280]  and they have they're silent though silent during those administrations and it's time to make an
[3:42:42.280 --> 3:42:48.360]  example it it's time to make an example of these people and oberman's a good place to start it
[3:42:48.360 --> 3:42:55.320]  with well oberman oberman is a media hack okay oberman is a media hack he's been rejected from
[3:42:55.320 --> 3:43:00.520]  multiple networks because he's such a hack he's a piece of crap okay keep oberman is a piece of
[3:43:00.520 --> 3:43:04.840]  crap i can't believe that we have to talk about this guy i can't but you know what that you know
[3:43:04.840 --> 3:43:09.960]  what we should do all of these democrats they're all saying the same thing all these liberals in the
[3:43:09.960 --> 3:43:15.320]  media we need an independent investigation we need a special prosecutor we need to find out the truth
[3:43:15.320 --> 3:43:21.240]  about russia okay what's stopping you what you're all working together to find this out
[3:43:21.240 --> 3:43:27.720]  why haven't you found anything yet look in fact let's put keith oberman in charge of it you want
[3:43:27.720 --> 3:43:33.160]  a special prosecutor keith oberman is ticked off he's looking for something to do let's give keith
[3:43:33.160 --> 3:43:37.880]  oberman the role of special prosecutor he'll do it for free i'm sure because it's for the country
[3:43:37.880 --> 3:43:41.720]  it's all about the republic so i'm sure he'll do it for free so let's give keith oberman the
[3:43:41.720 --> 3:43:46.360]  position of special prosecutor special investigator he's going to find out trump's russia ties and
[3:43:46.360 --> 3:43:50.680]  here's what'll happen he'll look like the total jackass that he is because he's not going to find
[3:43:50.680 --> 3:43:56.760]  anything final words cindy sorry for cursing at you before i take another call no that's all right
[3:43:56.760 --> 3:44:01.720]  and what's so bad about putin and uh saw it anyway they're the only ones in the middle east
[3:44:01.720 --> 3:44:07.240]  protecting the christians and i don't think they like that they protect the muslims but yeah and
[3:44:07.240 --> 3:44:11.560]  putin here's another guy thank you for the call cindy putin again not lionizing putin but
[3:44:11.560 --> 3:44:16.360]  russia is trying to redeem itself russia is trying to be nationalist they're trying to build up their
[3:44:16.360 --> 3:44:20.920]  own culture they're trying to rebuild russia they want russia to be great again and it's not globalist
[3:44:20.920 --> 3:44:24.440]  they're not going to go along with the globalist new world order so everybody hates russia but you
[3:44:24.440 --> 3:44:30.040]  know what a recent video of putin actually just surfaced that made me love him even more guys let's
[3:44:30.040 --> 3:44:42.440]  roll that video of latimer putin all right well i think we have this video ready to go well nonetheless
[3:44:42.440 --> 3:44:59.160]  okay here we go i think so this is probably tougher radio listeners to pick up so i'll
[3:44:59.160 --> 3:45:04.520]  just tell you what's going on this is latimer putin at a russian hockey game it's a traditional russian
[3:45:04.520 --> 3:45:10.520]  hockey match and he's out there skating around i mean how cool is this latimer putin skating around
[3:45:10.520 --> 3:45:17.400]  in a russian tradition of hockey and he comes off the ice in full skate gear and immediately gets
[3:45:17.400 --> 3:45:27.160]  asked about the james komi firing look here what about us let it finish looks the russians
[3:45:27.160 --> 3:45:32.920]  are so sick of this false narrative about trump russia can collusion it's literally like beyond
[3:45:32.920 --> 3:45:40.280]  a joke to them it's reached unprecedented levels of like joke it's not even a joke anymore it's
[3:45:40.280 --> 3:45:45.480]  like it's like a fairy tale it's like an old fable now like an old lore or something old
[3:45:45.480 --> 3:45:51.880]  traditional lore that just goes on yes the old fable about trump russia oh and they clink their
[3:45:51.880 --> 3:45:56.120]  glass and they have a good laugh and they go skate around yeah there's latimer putin playing hockey
[3:45:56.120 --> 3:46:03.400]  i'm sorry but i just get a total kick out of this i don't know why there's putin putting a slapshot on
[3:46:03.400 --> 3:46:12.360]  goal he must be taking the super super male vitality is latimer putin taking super male vitality
[3:46:12.360 --> 3:46:18.680]  and skating and lacing him up and playing hockey you know it's funny i you know most people probably
[3:46:18.680 --> 3:46:24.680]  couldn't even skate it's a it's a pretty hard skill and uh it's just it's just funny to see him out
[3:46:24.680 --> 3:46:28.040]  here skating around on the ice i don't know who's out here skating i don't really know much about
[3:46:28.040 --> 3:46:33.240]  this game i don't know if our russian agent in here can give me any details about what goes on
[3:46:33.240 --> 3:46:38.120]  if this is like a normal thing that they do in russia but it was it was cool i think to see
[3:46:38.120 --> 3:46:43.400]  vladimir putin out skating around playing hockey with some people in russia and then has to come
[3:46:43.400 --> 3:46:49.720]  out in in in full hockey gear gets asked about james comey gosh that had to be just an unbelievable
[3:46:49.720 --> 3:46:54.360]  moment in his life all right let's take one more quick call well actually let's hold that call over

[3:48:51.960 --> 3:48:58.040]  really drink coffee anymore it makes me too jittery so i found that the vitamin mineral fusion is
[3:48:58.040 --> 3:49:04.680]  actually a great supplement instead it gives you a nice little boost of energy without
[3:49:05.400 --> 3:49:09.480]  giving you the jitters but really it's all about the vitamins and the minerals that are in there
[3:49:09.480 --> 3:49:13.560]  yes this is my vitamin mineral fusion it kind of actually looks like coffee right now because
[3:49:13.560 --> 3:49:20.040]  it's like lighting but you can see that's that's red that's not brown but anyway i promise that
[3:49:20.040 --> 3:49:24.200]  it's really appetizing i used to do it every morning actually and then i switched to my caveman
[3:49:24.200 --> 3:49:29.480]  shake every morning uh now i do the vitamin mineral fusion usually at night uh or actually
[3:49:29.480 --> 3:49:33.560]  before a workout to be honest with you because uh you get those vitamins and minerals in your blood

[3:54:35.240 --> 3:54:41.800]  have a wuss as alex calls him a a fruitcake salad with two legs as the fbi director all right i'm
[3:54:41.800 --> 3:54:45.800]  going to do a quick news blitz here before hopefully we get to one more call what is going on with
[3:54:45.800 --> 3:54:51.800]  wiki leaks right now wiki leaks offers a hundred thousand dollars for trump combi tapes which
[3:54:51.800 --> 3:54:58.760]  may or may not exist and it's just strange wiki leaks also has offered combi a job wiki leaks
[3:54:58.760 --> 3:55:04.920]  is truly a rogue element folks like they are literally rogue and it seems like bucking every
[3:55:04.920 --> 3:55:09.240]  government right now is any government really cooperating with julie anisandre anymore except
[3:55:09.240 --> 3:55:15.880]  i guess ecuador which is being pressured now so it's just interesting for wiki leaks to offer
[3:55:15.880 --> 3:55:20.920]  combi a job and now offer a hundred thousand dollars for the secret combi tapes which might
[3:55:20.920 --> 3:55:26.120]  just be a trump troll but they probably do exist president trump launches commission on election
[3:55:26.120 --> 3:55:32.760]  integrity this is huge this is huge news donald trump has signed an executive order today this is
[3:55:32.760 --> 3:55:38.200]  actually yesterday establishing a commission to review alleged voter fraud and voter suppression
[3:55:38.200 --> 3:55:42.680]  thank you donald trump coming through on a project uh promise of course project veritas
[3:55:43.720 --> 3:55:49.400]  covered this and they are welcoming it and they've even offered to help donald trump which i think
[3:55:49.400 --> 3:55:55.960]  is huge you know president trump did an interview in time magazine and one thing stuck out to me
[3:55:55.960 --> 3:56:00.440]  he said this it was a little thing most people probably didn't even notice it of course i did
[3:56:00.440 --> 3:56:07.080]  because i get it he was asked what else he watches on television he says i used to watch sports
[3:56:07.080 --> 3:56:12.440]  hmm like me i don't watch anymore i'm now consumed by news and business i like the business stuff
[3:56:12.440 --> 3:56:16.920]  but this was the key doesn't watch sports anymore consumed by news now i resonate with that because
[3:56:16.920 --> 3:56:21.080]  that's how i feel folks who know me around here know my my apartment is literally like a circus
[3:56:21.080 --> 3:56:27.960]  of news literally all news i'm monitoring all day say with my desk here but see how he says this
[3:56:27.960 --> 3:56:34.280]  he's consumed by news folks this is an example of trickle down theory leadership trickling down
[3:56:34.280 --> 3:56:38.920]  our president is consumed by news our president is obsessed with what's going on in the world
[3:56:38.920 --> 3:56:43.640]  now guess what the general population is too now they've been asleep for a long time and they're
[3:56:43.640 --> 3:56:49.800]  very confused and disoriented and a lot of them mentally deranged but they do care now they are
[3:56:49.800 --> 3:56:54.200]  voluntary are paying attention now and they are vigilant now and that is key how about this
[3:56:54.920 --> 3:56:58.120]  stockboard asset tweeted this today this is a journalist i'm actually going to be talking
[3:56:58.120 --> 3:57:03.400]  to him next week in an interview um about the coverage that he did about the dire situations
[3:57:03.400 --> 3:57:07.080]  in baltimore right now but this is a guy an independent journalist he's been picked up by
[3:57:07.080 --> 3:57:13.080]  zero hedge before google trends human trafficking arrests surges to all-time highs this year this
[3:57:13.080 --> 3:57:18.840]  is the trickle down theory folks this is people caring this is you and independent media and
[3:57:18.840 --> 3:57:24.040]  info wars getting out the news that guess what human trafficking is a serious issue and the people
[3:57:24.040 --> 3:57:29.480]  care now the people care now how about this you want to talk about people here's here's not people

[3:57:34.520 --> 3:57:41.560]  parenthood to promote planned parenthood how sick is that you want to talk about draining the swamp
[3:57:42.360 --> 3:57:50.680]  kim courtney and chloe Kardashian are the the epitome of the cultural swamp folks fake people
[3:57:50.680 --> 3:58:00.360]  people taking up fake causes all for selfish reasons disgusting absolutely disgusting how
