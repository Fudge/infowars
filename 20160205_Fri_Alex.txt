[01:21.760 --> 01:26.360]  Kit Daniels got at a big Ron Paul event over the weekend he got interview with
[01:26.360 --> 01:31.560]  Ron Paul but also with Lou Rockwell it's a very powerful interview with rock
[01:31.560 --> 01:37.960]  walls Intel Lou Rockwell's Intel on Obama's plans to perhaps actually bring
[01:37.960 --> 01:43.720]  in martial law before he leaves office I kind of want to just go ahead and
[01:43.720 --> 01:47.520]  release that today but but we're gonna play the part about martial law coming
[01:47.520 --> 01:52.760]  up because it's so important and we have of course Democrat senator from
[01:52.760 --> 01:55.920]  Connecticut coming out and saying that's what the Republicans are trying to
[01:55.920 --> 02:00.920]  set up with Obama I mean this is really going on this is the time where the
[02:00.920 --> 02:05.400]  rhetoric that we've used in the past to describe what was coming is being proven
[02:05.400 --> 02:10.600]  as accurate let's look at drudgereport.com right now okay shitty that's
[02:10.600 --> 02:18.320]  one of the biggest banks in the world sounds alarm world economy in death
[02:18.320 --> 02:25.600]  spiral you click on it it's not info wars.com saying that we've actually had
[02:25.600 --> 02:29.480]  articles using the image of the grim reaper we're called fear porn dealers
[02:29.480 --> 02:34.120]  we don't get Pulitzer prizes for being exactly right five years beforehand we
[02:34.120 --> 02:40.560]  get attacked but I'm sure CNBC will get an award for this or something world
[02:40.560 --> 02:48.120]  economy trapped in death spiral and of course their answer to this is to give
[02:48.120 --> 02:54.840]  more power to the establishment who has engineered this and more credit lines of
[02:54.840 --> 02:59.040]  unlimited taxpayer money to the very same six really it's about five now some
[02:59.040 --> 03:03.200]  of consolidated global mega banks who openly launder the money and run the
[03:03.200 --> 03:09.440]  drugs on record I mean just completely on record and then they send police out
[03:09.440 --> 03:14.120]  to schools to tell kids don't use drugs I'm not against the police officers I'm
[03:14.120 --> 03:19.560]  just saying it's stupid the school on one hand is pushing all this speed and
[03:19.560 --> 03:25.800]  all these other psychotropic drugs on the kids all these and Federman based
[03:25.800 --> 03:31.120]  systems and all these serotonry have taken hibiter anti-depressants that are
[03:31.120 --> 03:35.320]  so dangerous and linked to doubling suicide and all sorts of mental disorders
[03:35.320 --> 03:39.920]  and the rest of it that 20 some of the populations now on this country and they
[03:39.920 --> 03:43.040]  look at us with a straight face and say we need to lecture your kids don't use
[03:43.040 --> 03:47.440]  illegal drugs and the government is shipping them in to be stabilized
[03:47.440 --> 03:51.040]  civilization along with the money it's just like they say give your rights up
[03:51.040 --> 03:55.600]  civil emergency martial law in Europe don't criticize the open borders don't
[03:55.600 --> 03:59.480]  criticize socialism we're gonna arrest LePen the frontrunner in the French
[03:59.480 --> 04:07.160]  election because he criticized open borders but it's the government bringing
[04:07.160 --> 04:10.400]  in the radical terrorists who are attacking and then they use that pretext
[04:10.400 --> 04:15.400]  to take the freedom where is the two plus two equals four logic to recognize
[04:15.400 --> 04:18.880]  that's happening and realize the criminals have hijacked our governments
[04:18.880 --> 04:28.960]  globally George Arwell in his allegory 1984 based on his time in MI6 and OSS
[04:28.960 --> 04:36.880]  before that where he was a propagandist at BBC he says freedom is the ability to
[04:36.880 --> 04:41.080]  say two plus two equals four if you can do that everything else follows and
[04:41.080 --> 04:45.800]  O'Brien tortures him until he can't say two plus two equals four anymore and then
[04:45.800 --> 04:49.600]  O'Brien says we've won but even though we've won and broken you were still
[04:49.600 --> 04:51.640]  gonna shoot you in the back of the head one day when you don't know what's

[04:55.600 --> 05:02.120]  worshippers Winston's it's been revealed a secret 291 code is being used in
[05:02.120 --> 05:06.200]  Sweden to cover up thousands of crimes involving migrants according to a
[05:06.200 --> 05:10.840]  report in a Swedish newspaper around 5,000 incidents have been kept secret
[05:10.840 --> 05:14.880]  for the last four months including hundreds of cases of violence assaults
[05:14.880 --> 05:18.720]  two terror threats and four rapes the incidents have been covered up because of
[05:18.720 --> 05:21.760]  a directive from the National Operational Department that any
[05:21.760 --> 05:26.040]  information pertaining to the behavior of refugees be censored last month it was
[05:26.040 --> 05:30.000]  also reported that police weren't to use descriptions of refugee criminals so as
[05:30.000 --> 05:35.560]  not to appear racist and Germany's top broadcaster ZDF is also refusing to run
[05:35.560 --> 05:39.440]  crime stories about Muslim rape suspects because in the words of editor-in-chief
[05:39.440 --> 05:44.000]  we don't want to inflame the situation and spread the bad mood and the former
[05:44.000 --> 05:48.080]  head of ZDF revealed the station takes orders from the government on what to
[05:48.080 --> 05:52.200]  report and that journalists are not allowed to say anything negative about

[08:41.240 --> 08:48.040]  world economy trapped in death spiral we're going to be getting to that
[08:48.040 --> 08:58.520]  report obviously here in detail today we are also going to be interviewing a
[08:58.520 --> 09:10.800]  raft of guests here on the broadcast we are obviously gonna be breaking down the
[09:10.800 --> 09:14.600]  latest developments and polls out of New Hampshire and our own Richard Reeves is
[09:14.600 --> 09:20.840]  going to be joining us from the ground there at the end of the hour Sean Stone
[09:20.840 --> 09:26.760]  filmmaker son of Oliver Stone is joining us Kathleen Willie of course one of
[09:26.760 --> 09:30.880]  Clinton's victims who's not been speaking out quite a bit as of late but
[09:30.880 --> 09:35.320]  we've been able to get her on through some of our connections and of course John
[09:35.320 --> 09:40.320]  Rappaport will be joining us to cover the waterfront Zika and more and Rob
[09:40.320 --> 09:43.760]  do will be quarterbacking the fourth hour and we'll have a ton of special
[09:43.760 --> 09:51.520]  reports and key information then as well but before I get into this article
[09:51.520 --> 09:57.400]  city world economy trapped in death spiral it's important to know that the
[09:57.400 --> 10:01.680]  Russians basically have admitted to simulating nuclear attacks with their
[10:01.680 --> 10:09.360]  new high-tech I don't want to say copies but they're similar planes to say the B1
[10:09.360 --> 10:18.680]  bomber it's a more modern version of those army and Marine Corps chief says
[10:18.680 --> 10:25.000]  it's time for women to register for the drafts oh feminism is here you get to pay
[10:25.000 --> 10:31.840]  more taxes you get to be a slave you get to be drafted you get to be used as
[10:31.840 --> 10:36.600]  cannon fodder so this just gets better and better and there of course Bernie
[10:36.600 --> 10:40.720]  Sanders wants compulsory national service so Obama wants that too and of
[10:40.720 --> 10:43.880]  course both military and domestic where you wear little uniforms and march
[10:43.880 --> 10:48.800]  around that'll be your new job and then they give you government rations oh there
[10:48.800 --> 10:52.640]  won't be free welfare in the future the fattening and domestication of the
[10:52.640 --> 10:56.720]  American people is coming to an end just as it's doing in Europe and the
[10:56.720 --> 11:01.400]  pension funds will be taken over by the big mega banks for your protection but
[11:01.400 --> 11:06.080]  there will be fees applied and over the years your pensions will be shrunk down
[11:06.080 --> 11:10.440]  to about 20% of what they were and then if you survive all the cancer viruses
[11:10.440 --> 11:13.680]  you've been injected with you might be able to retire and have two or three
[11:13.680 --> 11:22.120]  jobs and get a small stipend of your money that wasn't leaked and leached out
[11:22.120 --> 11:28.480]  of you but the answer of the lottery ticket sports fan face painter culture
[11:28.480 --> 11:33.640]  will be screaming for more wealth redistribution as the economy shrinks as
[11:33.640 --> 11:40.960]  things unravel and why would the ultra-rich be on showing be driving
[11:40.960 --> 11:51.480]  be orchestrating be conducting the executing blueprinting masterminding
[11:51.480 --> 12:00.640]  quarterbacking why would they be running the big socialist commie revolution
[12:00.640 --> 12:09.040]  because socialism and communism don't exist except in two ways that actually
[12:09.040 --> 12:14.800]  help the people and in all the other hundreds of permutations it is always a
[12:14.800 --> 12:20.400]  way to take the general wealth by select groups who then consolidate its skim it
[12:20.400 --> 12:25.480]  decide where it's spent to control the engineering of society into a total
[12:25.480 --> 12:34.560]  domestication the two ways it works is if you do say have North Sea oil off the
[12:34.560 --> 12:41.720]  coast of Scotland worth even in a depreciated economy trillions and
[12:41.720 --> 12:49.960]  trillions and trillions some estimates are upwards of 15 trillion of
[12:49.960 --> 12:56.560]  recoverable resources just in waters that Scotland has is territorial areas and
[12:56.560 --> 13:01.360]  if you were to have companies come in who bid and give the highest percentage
[13:01.360 --> 13:07.360]  to the government and if you had direct payments of the money highly
[13:07.360 --> 13:15.400]  transparent after expenses with profit for the companies in a bad market you're
[13:15.400 --> 13:20.560]  talking about thousands of pounds a year per individual and in a booming
[13:20.560 --> 13:25.840]  oil-based economy we're talking tens of thousands of pounds a year or even more
[13:25.840 --> 13:31.240]  and free school and infrastructure and there's examples of this in Alaska and
[13:31.240 --> 13:36.520]  other areas they it's smaller but yeah that socialism it works if it's a
[13:36.520 --> 13:42.440]  shared communal resource government can never figure out how to extract it
[13:42.440 --> 13:46.600]  properly would break all the rules wouldn't be accountable but you bring
[13:46.600 --> 13:50.400]  in profit interest they could do it and then you have the philosopher king
[13:50.400 --> 13:59.000]  model of Muammar Gaddafi where you again have some of the most pure water in
[13:59.000 --> 14:04.080]  Africa and they're huge aquifer you've got great gas sweet oil sweet crude
[14:04.080 --> 14:09.080]  meaning doesn't need a lot of refinement and in the decades of the oil boom he
[14:09.080 --> 14:12.920]  turned that place into a paradise in many areas and created real infrastructure
[14:12.920 --> 14:17.640]  in real jobs and actually had lotteries and things where they just gave people
[14:17.640 --> 14:23.440]  jobs and then if you didn't perform you were fired but folks did perform and the
[14:23.440 --> 14:28.800]  economy just grew and was supporting much of Africa yeah socialism worked
[14:28.800 --> 14:35.080]  there it really did but only because they had liquid gold coming out of the
[14:35.080 --> 14:39.960]  ground and someone that actually gave it to the people but he didn't give it to
[14:39.960 --> 14:42.400]  him and say you can't have a man in the house he didn't give it to him and say
[14:42.400 --> 14:45.880]  you can't have a job he didn't give it to him see oh here's your welfare check
[14:45.880 --> 14:48.840]  but you can't try to get another job down get on your feet never got a debt
[14:48.840 --> 14:52.560]  oh here's a welfare check which can't have a man in the house oh here's a
[14:52.560 --> 14:57.320]  welfare check or here's your social security check you paid in to get and
[14:57.320 --> 15:03.240]  you deserve but oh sorry you can't have another job after you're 65 66 and then
[15:03.240 --> 15:09.600]  try to uplift the economy and your family no we want you at a low level and
[15:09.600 --> 15:14.240]  that's what socialists always do so it's the people driving socialism driving
[15:14.240 --> 15:18.360]  communism they always have the same pipe dreams always the same sales job always
[15:18.360 --> 15:23.640]  the same story always run by the very same groups the big megabanks Goldman
[15:23.640 --> 15:27.840]  Sachs JP Morgan look into for yourself they have been funding the Bolsheviks
[15:27.840 --> 15:36.720]  since 1970 the richest most powerful ruthless companies in the world and
[15:36.720 --> 15:39.240]  they're running the whole show and the reason I'm getting into this is at the
[15:39.240 --> 15:42.720]  bottom of the hour I'm an air of peace I shop for the nightly news going over
[15:42.720 --> 15:48.000]  Bernie Sanders and the fact that he is the 1% but beyond that it's the point
[15:48.000 --> 15:52.520]  0 0 0 0 0 0 and then it goes on from there but she did the math again last
[15:52.520 --> 15:59.520]  night we have a report and I was then digging into it last night want to do
[15:59.520 --> 16:05.000]  another report today doing searches and it blew me away I was criticizing
[16:05.000 --> 16:11.480]  Sanders in this report which he deserves but I was pointing out that a
[16:11.480 --> 16:18.920]  micron of 1% we're gonna show the numbers coming up but but we're talking
[16:18.920 --> 16:30.040]  6,000 people out of 7 and a half billion has 90% of the 55% or so of the world
[16:30.040 --> 16:37.720]  economy they have you see all of the 1% up to just this tiny little percentage
[16:37.720 --> 16:47.880]  has 10% of that 55% of the total wealth and it's that majority of the 1% you
[16:47.880 --> 16:52.640]  can say the 2% as well that in every metric every economic textbook it's
[16:52.640 --> 17:00.320]  known is the very blood cells of the body politic of the economy why do you
[17:00.320 --> 17:05.200]  think the globalist like Bernie Sanders and Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan and the
[17:05.200 --> 17:08.800]  Southern Poverty Law Center and Hillary Clinton and all these elites and the
[17:08.800 --> 17:13.960]  Rothschilds and Rockefellers worldwide are exterminating the middle class
[17:13.960 --> 17:20.800]  Argentina until about the 50s or so was richer than the United States and was
[17:20.800 --> 17:29.320]  behind Switzerland and Luxembourg as the richest country in the world the
[17:29.320 --> 17:35.640]  saying was as rich as an Argentine they were free market they had science
[17:35.640 --> 17:42.640]  factories art probably superior culture the United States they let the
[17:42.640 --> 17:48.720]  globalist in they are in a living hell I've read the reports I've had
[17:48.720 --> 17:52.440]  reporters down there Ted Anderson went down there he said he would see good
[17:52.440 --> 17:59.360]  looking families I saw even by that he goes like professional people living in
[17:59.360 --> 18:03.240]  doorways when 18 wheelers come over with cows on board the Washington Post
[18:03.240 --> 18:08.640]  report thousands will just come running out of the bushes with hatchets and
[18:08.640 --> 18:15.680]  knives just gobbling blood and guts like in a movie like something out of the
[18:15.680 --> 18:24.880]  revenant and it's all because they sold out the globalist and bought into it and
[18:24.880 --> 18:29.240]  the same things coming here boys and girls and don't forget who did it to

[23:10.880 --> 23:14.440]  it's about to reach a sudden and disturbing conclusion if he's right

[23:27.280 --> 23:31.840]  ago he warned that housing prices would collapse they did before that he warned
[23:31.840 --> 23:36.120]  that dot-com companies would crash they did those who listened had a chance to
[23:36.120 --> 23:40.440]  save themselves but this has nothing to do with the stock market this will

[24:11.880 --> 24:15.240]  before I get back into socialism and what it stands for but notice the more
[24:15.240 --> 24:19.480]  liberal we get the more socialist we get time magazine with the cover we're all
[24:19.480 --> 24:26.080]  socialists now with Obamacare three years ago in that past I'll break it down
[24:26.080 --> 24:30.000]  the next segment but I want to hit some other news but notice foreign banks that
[24:30.000 --> 24:34.880]  own insurance companies ride Obamacare to double and triple your prices cut your
[24:34.880 --> 24:43.840]  care massively reduce your choices and then their profits go up in the first
[24:43.840 --> 24:49.520]  two years alone forty seven point eight percent globally part of the big
[24:49.520 --> 24:56.160]  international insurance consortium numbers they released last year just on
[24:56.160 --> 25:00.840]  screwing America globally their profits go up forty seven percent with a bunch
[25:00.840 --> 25:05.440]  of fake socialist dirt bags making millions of dollars a year at CNN and
[25:05.440 --> 25:12.160]  MSNBC that fly around in helicopters and eat caviar all day with taxpayer
[25:12.160 --> 25:18.280]  stimulus money funding at MSNBC lecturing people that make two hundred
[25:18.280 --> 25:23.400]  thousand dollars a year individually that they're in the one percent horse
[25:23.400 --> 25:30.000]  manure these people are con artists let me explain they people go who are
[25:30.000 --> 25:33.800]  educated they go how is it that socialists don't know it becomes corrupt
[25:33.800 --> 25:38.480]  and blows up everywhere and is terrible why why why do they why do they promote
[25:38.480 --> 25:46.120]  it they should know better they know better they know full well it's a take
[25:46.120 --> 25:53.520]  over of the economy they're bank robbers the globalist took over the banks they
[25:53.520 --> 25:57.760]  robbed the banks at the top that's a really rob a bank you take it over then

[26:19.800 --> 26:24.800]  immigration laws all together we might as well abolish them in a shocking
[26:24.800 --> 26:28.040]  reversal of US policy US Customs and Border Protection agents are being told
[26:28.040 --> 26:31.680]  to release illegal immigrants and no longer order them to appear at
[26:31.680 --> 26:35.480]  deportation hearings essentially a license to stay in the United States a
[26:35.480 --> 26:42.160]  key agent testified Thursday to Congress I covered this yesterday and I've
[26:42.160 --> 26:48.000]  probably got 150 plus new articles today but but but how do you not just point
[26:48.000 --> 26:56.400]  that out what's more of course we told you this two years ago the stand-down
[26:56.400 --> 27:00.840]  order includes a requirement that the whereabouts for legal's release not
[27:00.840 --> 27:05.680]  be tracked yeah remember how they won't tell the governors where the refugees
[27:05.680 --> 27:14.080]  are going but oh don't you worry oh the police are listed into your cell phone
[27:14.080 --> 27:18.640]  with the ex with the stingray systems don't you worry you've got license plate
[27:18.640 --> 27:23.280]  reading cameras up everywhere tracking you oh don't you worry we're gonna search
[27:23.280 --> 27:28.000]  your kids at school oh don't you worry they're passing laws to forcibly
[27:28.000 --> 27:34.880]  inoculate you don't you worry if I get on an airplane and fly to DC or anywhere
[27:34.880 --> 27:42.840]  else to cover something they know exactly who I am and they direct me over to
[27:42.840 --> 27:46.960]  have my bags torn apart and the same thing happens to my crib and if I point
[27:46.960 --> 27:51.200]  out you know our borders are wide open they'll either say yeah I know I'm a
[27:51.200 --> 27:55.640]  listener this is terrible we know we're trying to unionize or you know what you
[27:55.640 --> 28:00.480]  want to miss your flight keep your mouth shut you know what that message is this

[28:13.480 --> 28:17.160]  government bringing in millions of illegals from war-torn areas who just

[28:33.440 --> 28:39.200]  madness no it's not because when there's unrest they're gonna start arresting oh
[28:39.200 --> 28:44.440]  I'm sorry they already are the French and the Germans and they're gonna put them
[28:44.440 --> 28:49.440]  in the prisons and they're gonna take the quote Muslim migrants and put them
[28:49.440 --> 28:52.440]  through a quick program and three or four years later they're gonna come out of
[28:52.440 --> 28:56.800]  socialist education systems college and they're gonna be wearing black uniforms
[28:56.800 --> 29:01.480]  come into those jail cells and they're gonna kick the teeth into those Germans
[29:01.480 --> 29:05.760]  and you know what when they were raped their wives they deserve it because they

[29:58.280 --> 30:03.240]  Democrats nationwide are feeling the burn with latest polls showing Bernie
[30:03.240 --> 30:07.720]  Sanders is nearly tied with Hillary Clinton Sanders also bests Hillary in
[30:07.720 --> 30:12.960]  the favorability rating Bernie's at nine points and Hillary is at negative 17
[30:12.960 --> 30:18.240]  in recent days political observers have called her voice loud flat harassing to
[30:18.240 --> 30:22.440]  the ear and that her tone is punishing of course this just means everyone is
[30:22.440 --> 30:27.040]  being sexist critiquing her impassioned tone on the campaign trail and they
[30:27.040 --> 30:31.600]  point out how forceful tones are the trademark of Bernie Sanders and in the
[30:31.600 --> 30:35.880]  sharpest debate yet Sanders went after Clinton for being a slave to Wall Street
[30:35.880 --> 30:40.560]  interests to his credit Sanders doesn't have a super PAC raising huge sums from
[30:40.560 --> 30:44.280]  Wall Street like Clinton but he was still able to raise five million more
[30:44.280 --> 30:48.000]  than his opponent in January this should be a loud wake-up call for the

[40:44.900 --> 40:48.220]  power plants it'd be the biggest news the planet ever saw because it's fantasy
[40:48.220 --> 40:53.180]  it's not real but the government under UN control shuts down over a thousand
[40:53.180 --> 40:57.500]  plants and then let's globalist Soros and General Electric companies stay open

[41:31.820 --> 41:35.780]  anything we can't do anything it's actually true the American people are
[41:35.780 --> 41:43.700]  just running around like the most brain-damaged morons in a trance while
[41:43.700 --> 41:46.860]  a 21st century Blitzkrieg has taken everything we got down to make us
[41:46.860 --> 41:49.940]  dependent and man the the boa constrictor is wrapping around us and
[41:49.940 --> 41:57.300]  it's just now starting to squeeze and boy when it squeezes and the public goes
[41:57.300 --> 42:02.940]  into collective panic gasping for air with their eyes bugging out the

[43:05.980 --> 43:15.940]  whole language not you a cult of venomous trash I'm gonna get into the whole
[43:15.940 --> 43:21.180]  stock market situation and then they have the right wing come out and go the
[43:21.180 --> 43:24.100]  extreme right wing come on go oh you claim the Chinese or influence our
[43:24.100 --> 43:30.780]  policies in the Saudi Arabia Israel agent all these pseudo-intellectuals who

[43:44.660 --> 43:50.220]  America or Russia or China I'm against the corrupt elites but that's why we're
[43:50.220 --> 43:58.300]  also done even our pseudo-intellectuals just sit around and and just come up with
[43:58.300 --> 44:01.660]  little terms like the pseudo left says everyone's races that doesn't agree with
[44:01.660 --> 44:05.380]  them and then the ultra racist right wing says everyone works for Israel that
[44:05.380 --> 44:08.860]  doesn't bow to them and then all they do is in fight with each other all day it
[44:08.860 --> 44:17.260]  is splendid idiocy and then look at these other headlines Paris attack leader

[46:23.620 --> 46:26.140]  Bernie Sanders report in a moment and I'm gonna have to skip this one break
[46:26.140 --> 46:30.060]  today that's it because I got Richard Reeves coming up just for about five
[46:30.060 --> 46:33.260]  minutes to start the next hour to give us an update on what's happening in New
[46:33.260 --> 46:37.220]  Hampshire as I just dropped my sheet over the side there we please give that to
[46:37.220 --> 46:41.260]  me thank you try over here on the corner I need it before I go any further
[46:41.260 --> 46:47.660]  though look if you're not spreading the word about this broadcast your nuts we
[46:47.660 --> 46:55.300]  are in a savage 110% truth assault on the globalist pulling no punches in
[46:55.300 --> 47:03.940]  death defying viciousness thank you this is the real deal this is the organic
[47:03.940 --> 47:16.020]  spontaneous response to the globalist okay and we're taking action and that's
[47:16.020 --> 47:20.900]  why we're attacked from the corners of the compass 360 because we are over the
[47:20.900 --> 47:23.940]  target we are committed we're not backing down we're not stopping if you
[47:23.940 --> 47:27.820]  do not tell folks about info wars.com forward slash show and all the free
[47:27.820 --> 47:32.980]  podcast and iPhone and droid apps and the free video feeds might as well just
[47:32.980 --> 47:35.580]  go join George Soros and I know most of you are we need to all redouble our
[47:35.580 --> 47:40.580]  efforts myself included if you are not telling friends and family and neighbors
[47:40.580 --> 47:44.100]  and and and folks at work and people at the grocery store in the gas station and
[47:44.100 --> 47:48.380]  it four-way stops about the local AM and FM stations that carry the show and if
[47:48.380 --> 47:51.700]  you're not supporting their sponsors or or or at least telling them you support
[47:51.700 --> 47:56.860]  them and telling friends about those sponsors and thanking those stations they
[47:56.860 --> 48:01.300]  are fighting the new world order with us these are patriots and the fact is
[48:01.300 --> 48:04.780]  people now know what I've warned of is real even though it's horrific they know
[48:04.780 --> 48:10.340]  we're doing this try to save the country yeah we're skipping the network right
[48:10.340 --> 48:21.220]  guys now before we go any further people need to understand that this is a plan
[48:21.220 --> 48:24.620]  to tell a terry and take over and isn't going to be soft for much longer it's
[48:24.620 --> 48:30.780]  going to be hard it's going to be rough it's going to be burning hot so when I
[48:30.780 --> 48:33.460]  get animated and upset and everything's are bouncing off the walls it's because
[48:33.460 --> 48:43.980]  as a man who's dialed in watching the systematic takedown of prosperity and a
[48:43.980 --> 48:48.500]  freedom and who's replacing it and knowing we're going to the clutches of
[48:48.500 --> 48:55.580]  the ultimate scientific terror I'm struggling I'm fighting for my life
[48:55.580 --> 49:01.140]  folks and people understand this is a death battle and what's a death battle
[49:01.140 --> 49:06.780]  it's another way of saying fight to the death they are not going to stop they're
[49:06.780 --> 49:12.900]  not going to back off serving them giving into them will only destroy you
[49:12.900 --> 49:17.420]  and your family faster and as things start getting nastier you're going to
[49:17.420 --> 49:20.820]  realize you have nothing to do but resist and they're trying to program
[49:20.820 --> 49:28.260]  everybody to get violent that's not the answer at this stage it is in Syria
[49:28.260 --> 49:32.380]  about kind of forces are attacking they try to arresting people in mass rentable
[49:32.380 --> 49:35.700]  to relocation camps you know demonizing patriots on the air then you
[49:35.700 --> 49:39.020]  got to defend yourself and you know all these folks that want to play soldier
[49:39.020 --> 49:43.100]  against the American people don't get a chance and I don't relish that because
[49:43.100 --> 49:45.660]  the globalists are the ones that are going to win in that but you will fail
[49:45.660 --> 49:49.740]  and they know you're going to be destroyed and I'm talking to the security
[49:49.740 --> 49:54.660]  services of the so-called US government you are a row of shark teeth that are
[49:54.660 --> 49:58.260]  going to fall out in the fight with us and they got more rows coming up they
[49:58.260 --> 50:04.940]  intend the next row to get knocked out then the third big row comes in
[50:07.940 --> 50:12.820]  you're delusional if you serve the system and think you're part of the
[50:12.820 --> 50:23.340]  winning team shining on with bills above he is not winning be smart most
[50:23.340 --> 50:27.300]  people in the system have now chosen sides that's why the globalists are so
[50:27.300 --> 50:32.140]  scared they want to start a huge war with Russia or China to get the people in
[50:32.140 --> 50:39.100]  the government to line up and do what they're told is an outside threat now

[53:11.260 --> 53:15.940]  competitors winning if something happened to me and in the last year or so
[53:15.940 --> 53:19.980]  I've even transcended not jealousy but when someone attacks you it's not
[53:19.980 --> 53:22.860]  jealousy it's like they're trying to destroy you because they're jealous and
[53:22.860 --> 53:26.180]  then you don't want them to win or grind you down that used to be one of my
[53:26.180 --> 53:30.180]  motivations I am so much stronger now that I just could care less about lies
[53:30.180 --> 53:35.380]  at all or people wanting to destroy me I have just transcended it thank you
[53:35.380 --> 53:40.820]  Christ thank you Christ for that and folks can notice I'm more hardcore I'm
[53:40.820 --> 53:45.740]  more vicious I'm more focused I'm quicker because this is it it's it's not
[53:45.740 --> 53:50.220]  coming it's here this is the beginning and whether it's the final tribulation
[53:50.220 --> 53:53.700]  and the Christ says there's many anti-Christ that come before the anti-Christ
[53:53.700 --> 53:59.020]  this is this is tribulation and they've taken over the churches they've taken
[53:59.020 --> 54:01.260]  over the systems we're in so much trouble I don't know that go to all the
[54:01.260 --> 54:04.620]  report now I kind of ran out of time but but here's part of the Bernie Sanders
[54:04.620 --> 54:09.580]  report from the nightly news breaking down the facts of the cave here it is
[54:09.580 --> 54:17.220]  let me show in a parable to what extent our nature is enlightened or
[54:17.220 --> 54:29.060]  unenlightened in vision human figures living in an underground cave
[54:29.060 --> 54:36.980]  yeah they've been from that childhood and have their legs and necks chained so
[54:36.980 --> 54:41.340]  that they cannot move and can only see before them being prevented by the chains
[54:41.340 --> 54:51.780]  from turning their heads around
[54:51.780 --> 54:58.140]  Plato one of the most famous Greek philosophers and historians in world
[54:58.140 --> 55:04.660]  history famously had his allegory of the cave if you're brought up in a box like
[55:04.660 --> 55:07.420]  some of these young women we've heard about who were kidnapped at birth and
[55:07.420 --> 55:11.980]  live in a trailer until they were 15 years old you believe that the confines
[55:11.980 --> 55:17.260]  of that box is the universe and is that world and your captor that comes in to
[55:17.260 --> 55:21.900]  feed you a few times a day and rape you or whatever the case may be you think
[55:21.900 --> 55:25.980]  that's your father your mother figure your god figure that's everybody to you
[55:25.980 --> 55:30.060]  and that's why I'm shooting this here in this twilight with just one light
[55:30.060 --> 55:36.820]  above me is to illustrate visually not just with facts and statistics that we
[55:36.820 --> 55:41.020]  are being kept in the dark and no one more so than Bernie Sanders supporters
[55:41.020 --> 55:45.020]  this is not a pitch for Hillary or anybody else the point is you're really
[55:45.020 --> 55:48.980]  being kept in the dark what Bernie Sanders is engaged in has been funded
[55:48.980 --> 55:55.540]  for over 150 years by European royalty the aristocracy as well as the new
[55:55.540 --> 56:01.100]  robber bearing class that was forming the last 150 years to scapegoat free market
[56:01.100 --> 56:06.500]  as the problem and to sell communism and socialism and wealth redistribution as a
[56:06.500 --> 56:11.220]  solution when the elites themselves are international in scope largely exempt
[56:11.220 --> 56:17.220]  from the taxes like Google and General Electric and Warren Buffett today who
[56:17.220 --> 56:20.420]  calls for higher taxes on the middle class the calls the rich but as the
[56:20.420 --> 56:25.500]  biggest recipient of course of the 2008 banker bailout so this is how this can
[56:25.500 --> 56:29.820]  work see ultra rich going after the middle class so when Sanders says the
[56:29.820 --> 56:37.460]  one percent's the enemy well 90% of the 1% hardly have any of the wealth when
[56:37.460 --> 56:41.580]  you do the math of seven and a half billion people in the world and 6,000
[56:41.580 --> 56:45.900]  elite managers and owners according to the Kissinger group and the book super
[56:45.900 --> 56:50.380]  class written by Rothkopf the elite themselves say there's 6,000 that own
[56:50.380 --> 56:54.420]  and rule half the wealth of the world and that's back on that book was written
[56:54.420 --> 56:59.100]  eight years ago it's closer to 60% of the wealth now and so they're desperate
[56:59.100 --> 57:03.260]  to scapegoat the middle class for what they've done as if Bernie Sanders is
[57:03.260 --> 57:08.460]  greedy and bad because he has $600,000 or you know makes a quarter million a
[57:08.460 --> 57:12.980]  year as a senator no he buys houses he buys cars he buys services it's that
[57:12.980 --> 57:16.140]  middle class and upper middle class it funds everything folks what I'm gonna do
[57:16.140 --> 57:19.740]  is I went to this late we're gonna pause it right there and back up about 10
[57:19.740 --> 57:24.140]  seconds come back in that next little segment and go to it because what I
[57:24.140 --> 57:27.300]  didn't finish up saying earlier was doing research on this last night
[57:27.300 --> 57:32.620]  Sanders is always pushing 1% 1% they're the enemy they're bad they stole it but
[57:32.620 --> 57:39.740]  then I actually found an article out of Politifact that found his statement is
[57:39.740 --> 57:44.340]  true that Sanders knows this of course and said exactly what I just said in
[57:44.340 --> 57:54.500]  this report Bernie Sanders says top 0.1% in US have almost as much wealth as the
[57:54.500 --> 58:03.900]  bottom 90 and he means that of the bottom 90 of the 1% well actually we
[58:03.900 --> 58:08.700]  have the real math for you and I'm not bragging but I'm proud of the power of
[58:08.700 --> 58:11.900]  this broadcast we're the ones when I started this 1% stuff six seven years
[58:11.900 --> 58:17.180]  ago that went in and said it was 0.000000 depending on how you
[58:17.180 --> 58:23.260]  calculated it after that so we have the latest numbers coming up so it's the
[58:23.260 --> 58:29.900]  very elites sickening the public on the 1% the 2% the general public thinks
[58:29.900 --> 58:35.300]  one of the nicer cars stolen so this is class warfare by the elite against the
[58:35.300 --> 58:38.500]  general public it's totally sickening we're gonna show you the proof when
[58:38.500 --> 58:42.900]  we're back in 70 seconds with a second hour

[59:49.220 --> 01:00:12.220]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:00:12.220 --> 01:00:22.260]  That's a really informative guest coming up after the break but right now I was
[01:00:22.260 --> 01:00:26.380]  mentioning that after I shot this video yesterday I actually was searching the
[01:00:26.380 --> 01:00:30.940]  0.1% and found that Bernie Sanders has now lately in some speeches been
[01:00:30.940 --> 01:00:35.140]  saying it's not really the 1% it's the 0.1% shouldn't they have to pay
[01:00:35.140 --> 01:00:38.660]  billions. Yeah but they already rigged the system and then it turns out they're
[01:00:38.660 --> 01:00:42.500]  the ones behind the scenes promoting this and he's their front guy just like
[01:00:42.500 --> 01:00:48.060]  the Federal Reserve banks oppose the Federal Reserve passage in 1913 publicly
[01:00:48.060 --> 01:00:52.020]  to try to fool the public into supporting it. It still didn't work so they
[01:00:52.020 --> 01:00:55.060]  rammed it through on December 23rd in the dead of night. Here's the rest of the
[01:00:55.060 --> 01:00:59.860]  report. Elite managers and owners according to the Kissinger Group and the
[01:00:59.860 --> 01:01:04.860]  book superclass written by Rothkopf the elite themselves say there's 6,000 that
[01:01:04.860 --> 01:01:08.940]  own and rule half the wealth of the world and that's back on that book was
[01:01:08.940 --> 01:01:13.420]  written eight years ago it's closer to 60% of the wealth now and so they're
[01:01:13.420 --> 01:01:17.320]  desperate to scapegoat the middle class for what they've done as if Bernie
[01:01:17.320 --> 01:01:22.900]  Sanders is greedy and bad because he has $600,000 or you know makes a quarter
[01:01:22.900 --> 01:01:26.900]  million a year as a senator. No he buys houses he buys cars he buys services
[01:01:26.900 --> 01:01:31.100]  it's that middle class and upper middle class that funds everything but I want
[01:01:31.100 --> 01:01:34.180]  to show you the math and it varies you know there's some estimates that US
[01:01:34.180 --> 01:01:40.900]  wealth is close to 90 trillion public private you name it some estimates as
[01:01:40.900 --> 01:01:47.620]  much as 250 billion globally in real assets and private including charities
[01:01:47.620 --> 01:01:51.820]  but if you look at the derivatives 2.2 is what our own government says they
[01:01:51.820 --> 01:01:58.980]  believe there is worldwide quadrillion that's 2200 trillion and growing its
[01:01:58.980 --> 01:02:03.780]  derivatives it's fake only Goldman Sachs JP Morgan a few others own it only
[01:02:03.780 --> 01:02:07.860]  they've been allowed the mega banks to engage in such crimes the same ones that
[01:02:07.860 --> 01:02:12.420]  fix the stock market fix the interest rates fix the currency rates so let's
[01:02:12.420 --> 01:02:17.540]  come out of Plato's cave and look not at the 1% that that it's our enemy but the
[01:02:17.540 --> 01:02:25.260]  point after the 1% you know this is of the 1% the point 0 0 0 0 0 0 it's been a
[01:02:25.260 --> 01:02:28.220]  while since I did this or I see what the latest numbers are when we crunch and
[01:02:28.220 --> 01:02:32.060]  we've got some of them pulled up so let's come out of the cave and again we're
[01:02:32.060 --> 01:02:34.820]  not offering all the answers in the universe as we come out of the cave as
[01:02:34.820 --> 01:02:38.980]  Plato said there are other mysteries once you come out and other truths and
[01:02:38.980 --> 01:02:42.860]  other things to discover it's just one more box we've transcended but we've
[01:02:42.860 --> 01:02:45.940]  got Josh Owens here with some of this pulled up from establishment sources
[01:02:45.940 --> 01:02:50.260]  seeing in how close are you to the top 1% then they'll save between a quarter
[01:02:50.260 --> 01:02:55.220]  million to $400,000 they debate which is the 1% but if you're making that a
[01:02:55.220 --> 01:03:00.180]  year as a household both people 200 something thousand dollars then you're
[01:03:00.180 --> 01:03:05.640]  the evil 1% okay but if you and I guess you've got time to do this now divide
[01:03:05.640 --> 01:03:09.460]  seven and a half billion people into six thousand that they admit have more than
[01:03:09.460 --> 01:03:16.380]  half the wealth let's just say half we come up with an astounding number so now
[01:03:16.380 --> 01:03:26.900]  we have this number 0.00000842 1 so that's the ultra elite they would say
[01:03:26.900 --> 01:03:33.220]  1% has half the wealth no no it is that tiny 6,000 that has more than half the
[01:03:33.220 --> 01:03:37.940]  wealth if you actually do the math which we've done and actually look at the
[01:03:37.940 --> 01:03:46.140]  rest of 1% or even the 2% you could take the wealth of the bottom 2% all of that
[01:03:46.140 --> 01:03:50.020]  first point and most of the second point and it wouldn't run the US for even a
[01:03:50.020 --> 01:03:55.500]  year or two now the US has a 19 trillion dollar debt as of Monday it's now
[01:03:55.500 --> 01:04:01.140]  Thursday going into Friday here on the nightly news so think about that think
[01:04:01.140 --> 01:04:04.500]  about that you're being told the 1% is the enemy all day when it's that very
[01:04:04.500 --> 01:04:07.380]  elite that's telling you that they're the problem we're not saying Bernie's
[01:04:07.380 --> 01:04:11.020]  this evil guy because he's 1% and of course the little socialist you know
[01:04:11.020 --> 01:04:15.060]  that's because you're a lot of a lot of the 1% it's the dumbest argument I've
[01:04:15.060 --> 01:04:18.500]  ever seen you know what socialism and communism delivers hell on earth Bernie
[01:04:18.500 --> 01:04:22.380]  Sanders for sure probably so you're feeling the burn any particular reason
[01:04:22.380 --> 01:04:29.420]  probably as a student all of his policies about tuition free college I
[01:04:29.420 --> 01:04:34.140]  don't know if it'll be possible but it works for me who would pay for the free
[01:04:34.140 --> 01:04:39.220]  tuition hopefully the rich people of America I mean this is the most gang
[01:04:39.220 --> 01:04:43.260]  mentality dumb down it's like we want to elect Hitler he says he'll invade
[01:04:43.260 --> 01:04:45.580]  France and give us free stuff I mean this is a
[01:04:45.580 --> 01:04:52.620]  radical conquest born system that we're now in our shows reporting for info wars.com are you
[01:04:52.620 --> 01:04:59.620]  still inside the cave we'll be back on the other side I'm Alex Jones the head

[01:08:16.820 --> 01:08:20.700]  the next 30 minutes we're going to cover the waterfront with a really
[01:08:20.700 --> 01:08:25.860]  interesting filmmaker talk show host researcher of course that's Sean stone
[01:08:25.860 --> 01:08:32.500]  and he's also the son of the famous director Oliver stone really one of my
[01:08:32.500 --> 01:08:37.620]  favorite screenwriters talk about Conan things like Scarface fly pelican I tell
[01:08:37.620 --> 01:08:41.620]  you we're gonna be talking to him about the clash of civilizations he's
[01:08:41.620 --> 01:08:45.740]  traveled to Iran you name it researched it predicted now what we see
[01:08:45.740 --> 01:08:49.740]  happening again we're not wanting war with the muslims but you bring in the
[01:08:49.740 --> 01:08:53.740]  radical jihadists they attack then you have your pretext to go into attack
[01:08:53.740 --> 01:08:56.660]  countries that didn't even attack us just like Saudi Arabia is involved in 9
[01:08:56.660 --> 01:09:01.900]  11 then we attack of course Iraq so he wants to get into that he wants to get
[01:09:01.900 --> 01:09:06.740]  into what's happening in Europe what's developing here in the United States I
[01:09:06.740 --> 01:09:11.660]  mean now world government with the pope calling for it is out in the open but I
[01:09:11.660 --> 01:09:15.580]  also want to pick his brain because I'm gonna be on his show today about
[01:09:15.580 --> 01:09:19.420]  Hollywood we have seen so many people come out and say I'm not a liberal I'm
[01:09:19.420 --> 01:09:24.580]  not a conservative I'm a libertarian I like 1776 and then we do research we
[01:09:24.580 --> 01:09:28.580]  find out those folks are anti-globalist anti-new world order we have Chris
[01:09:28.580 --> 01:09:30.860]  Carter coming out saying he's a big listener of the show we're gonna be
[01:09:30.860 --> 01:09:34.300]  talking to him soon and you know model some of the new ex files off this show
[01:09:34.300 --> 01:09:38.460]  and my character that's just an example of the success of questioning things and
[01:09:38.460 --> 01:09:45.220]  of course John stone hosted with the Jesse Ventura son the hit program
[01:09:45.220 --> 01:09:51.060]  American conspiracy and more so he's done so much I want to get his pulse on
[01:09:51.060 --> 01:09:55.500]  the state of the world and he also has some fun he's gone around and done a
[01:09:55.500 --> 01:09:59.860]  big spoof film on these TV paranormal shows it's very very exciting he's
[01:09:59.860 --> 01:10:03.340]  directed scores of films and his own right was about to do a big one with
[01:10:03.340 --> 01:10:07.420]  Rowdy Piper and until he died that was very very sad we always appreciate him
[01:10:07.420 --> 01:10:12.500]  getting Piper on the show but he'll he'll he'll live forever through they live so
[01:10:12.500 --> 01:10:16.780]  mr. Stone thank you so much for coming on paranormal activity security squad
[01:10:16.780 --> 01:10:22.780]  calm but but also let's plug your radio TV program you're doing what's so
[01:10:22.780 --> 01:10:28.540]  popular tell folks about that yeah well we're doing a buzz saw obviously which
[01:10:28.540 --> 01:10:31.900]  which you know you can be on a little bit later and that's been online since
[01:10:31.900 --> 01:10:36.980]  2013 with Tyra Ventura and Tabitha Wallace who ultimately split off to do
[01:10:36.980 --> 01:10:41.780]  watching the Hawks for RT and I also do that program with them so and that's on
[01:10:41.780 --> 01:10:44.380]  RT global it didn't I mean that's that's one of the biggest shows in the
[01:10:44.380 --> 01:10:48.540]  world international exactly so we're really trying to cover the whole span
[01:10:48.540 --> 01:10:54.180]  of things from from alternative news on television to the online sector and then
[01:10:54.180 --> 01:10:59.100]  as you mentioned film so you know we try to keep basically keep spreading the
[01:10:59.100 --> 01:11:04.220]  message and raising consciousness in every capacity that we can well it's
[01:11:04.220 --> 01:11:10.180]  very very exciting tell folks exactly where they find buzz saw so buzz saw is
[01:11:10.180 --> 01:11:13.940]  big it's YouTube I mean that's where it lives really on YouTube but if there's a
[01:11:13.940 --> 01:11:20.340]  homepage which is the lip dot TV slash shows slash buzz saw and we've got we've
[01:11:20.340 --> 01:11:24.460]  done like 150 episodes this point and you know across the spectrum from
[01:11:24.460 --> 01:11:29.660]  politics to the esoteric to the extraterrestrial to the economic rate
[01:11:29.660 --> 01:11:32.780]  we've had Jim Rogers on recently I know you've interviewed we had
[01:11:32.780 --> 01:11:36.940]  Oliver Yannick most recently on buzz saw talking about the immigrant crisis in
[01:11:36.940 --> 01:11:39.940]  Europe and basically how it's simply amazing all the work you're doing and
[01:11:39.940 --> 01:11:43.540]  it's so exciting let's get into Hollywood first before we get into all
[01:11:43.540 --> 01:11:48.140]  these other classes civilizations am I wrong in saying that there's a major
[01:11:48.140 --> 01:11:52.380]  revolt against the orthodoxy of saying you're conservative or you're liberal
[01:11:52.380 --> 01:11:55.700]  it's kind of like your dad has said in his big history series just the whole
[01:11:55.700 --> 01:11:59.500]  thing we're told isn't real we have to rethink the whole thing I mean is there
[01:11:59.500 --> 01:12:04.420]  a rebellion in Hollywood and in culture in general that's accelerating I seem
[01:12:04.420 --> 01:12:08.380]  to really be seeing it erupt like Mount St. Helens or is that just a
[01:12:08.380 --> 01:12:14.620]  pre-eruption or am I wrong no I mean I think that there could be it's difficult
[01:12:14.620 --> 01:12:18.700]  to put your pulse on what really is in Hollywood because I'll tell you aside
[01:12:18.700 --> 01:12:23.900]  from the Academy level of Hollywood which I mean look at the Oscars last few
[01:12:23.900 --> 01:12:27.420]  years you can see the Masonic symbolism all over it and you see that this is the
[01:12:27.420 --> 01:12:30.460]  fingerprints of government for example and Michelle Obama handed out the Oscar
[01:12:30.460 --> 01:12:34.660]  choose to Argo remember that year a few years ago and the idea of this
[01:12:34.660 --> 01:12:39.780]  relationship of politics military and entertainment yes there is there's always
[01:12:39.780 --> 01:12:43.860]  been a certain marriage there we've seen how obviously it's the top of the
[01:12:43.860 --> 01:12:47.380]  pyramid for mind control I totally agree with you and I'm saying that there's
[01:12:47.380 --> 01:12:50.220]  more of a rebellion against that well let's get into symbolism then because
[01:12:50.220 --> 01:12:55.260]  you're an you're an expert on that but now Super Bowl Grammys Emmys huge
[01:12:55.260 --> 01:13:00.060]  pyramids human sacrifice Satan worship I mean it is just over the top what is the
[01:13:00.060 --> 01:13:04.740]  point are they trying to bring something in well sure I mean like you know take
[01:13:04.740 --> 01:13:09.020]  David Bowie's passing very you know track you know if you're a fan of Bowie's
[01:13:09.020 --> 01:13:11.860]  obviously it's tragic but it was also very sudden and on the night of the
[01:13:11.860 --> 01:13:14.700]  Golden Globes and we've seen the last few years that oftentimes you'll see on
[01:13:14.700 --> 01:13:18.180]  the eve of one of these ceremonies whether it was Philip Seymour Hoffman on
[01:13:18.180 --> 01:13:21.420]  the eve of the Super Bowl or Whitney Houston on the Grammys or Whitney
[01:13:21.420 --> 01:13:27.780]  Houston's daughter and your scops break it up he releases a music video of him
[01:13:27.780 --> 01:13:31.260]  dying three days before are you saying maybe he committed suicide as part of
[01:13:31.260 --> 01:13:36.300]  the ritual no I'm not saying anything as far as suicide or even necessarily
[01:13:36.300 --> 01:13:40.460]  murder what I'm saying is that if you believe in these these forces that
[01:13:40.460 --> 01:13:47.740]  oftentimes are being invoked through rituals then perhaps they are induced
[01:13:47.740 --> 01:13:53.740]  events maybe these are induced sacrifices but well sure what do you think
[01:13:53.740 --> 01:13:57.100]  about Randy Quaid then because we know there are some big lawyers and folks
[01:13:57.100 --> 01:14:00.300]  out there that have been connected you know to getting rid of people so they
[01:14:00.300 --> 01:14:03.980]  can take their money I mean undoubtedly that happens and and but I mean what do
[01:14:03.980 --> 01:14:08.180]  you what do you think about the supposed Hollywood Mafia and the Hitsquats
[01:14:08.180 --> 01:14:12.340]  sure and I think we've seen a certain indication that's a real thing and
[01:14:12.340 --> 01:14:16.380]  that's been talked about you know we try to get Randy in our film actually the
[01:14:16.380 --> 01:14:18.860]  same one that we want to get right you piper and Randy couldn't get into the
[01:14:18.860 --> 01:14:22.980]  country because because of what's happened ever since he came out speaking
[01:14:22.980 --> 01:14:27.180]  on this topic and he's been basically run out of the country so I do think that
[01:14:27.180 --> 01:14:31.260]  there is a real component to that but ultimately again I think there's there's
[01:14:31.260 --> 01:14:34.300]  tears remember there's the higher level of power and then there's the ones who
[01:14:34.300 --> 01:14:37.820]  are awake who are like the Chris Carter's and like my father and others who
[01:14:37.820 --> 01:14:41.500]  basically just say look we're going to speak our truth and there could be a
[01:14:41.500 --> 01:14:45.060]  rallying cry because we see the disintegration of media's control through
[01:14:45.060 --> 01:14:49.660]  the studio system we see now more online programming right we can release
[01:14:49.660 --> 01:14:54.380]  films online we can have shows like yours that are uncensored so that's how
[01:14:54.380 --> 01:14:57.900]  the system will break down its power so you'll see a bifurcation basically
[01:14:57.900 --> 01:15:01.180]  between the higher-ups the ones who are trying to create rituals to continue
[01:15:01.180 --> 01:15:06.820]  their power that's right make no mistake from Bohemian Grove to Scullum Bones to
[01:15:06.820 --> 01:15:11.700]  the Super Bowl they are conducting high-level mystery school rituals
[01:15:11.700 --> 01:15:15.620]  believing that entities are giving them power whether that's real or not the
[01:15:15.620 --> 01:15:19.820]  elite believe that they are in contact with interdimensional beings giving
[01:15:19.820 --> 01:15:25.660]  them power on earth yes yes absolutely and we go into that in this new movie
[01:15:25.660 --> 01:15:28.860]  when we talk about Pernum activity security squad you'll get a taste of
[01:15:28.860 --> 01:15:32.300]  that realm in which the elites are dealing with although we do with a lot
[01:15:32.300 --> 01:15:35.740]  of sense of humor sure that's a good way to get it to folks is comedy there's
[01:15:35.740 --> 01:15:38.460]  also some lovely ladies in there so I'm just always fun to have them in a film
[01:15:38.460 --> 01:15:43.980]  but I mean I want to talk about the film but getting serious you told me you
[01:15:43.980 --> 01:15:46.380]  know off-regards pretty interesting stuff about the Illuminati and things I
[01:15:46.380 --> 01:15:51.540]  personally had some establishment run-ins with that type of stuff going on
[01:15:51.540 --> 01:15:54.980]  but for those that don't know there's obviously more than one Illuminati and
[01:15:54.980 --> 01:15:58.020]  and there are a lot of different cults and things but a lot of high-level stuff
[01:15:58.020 --> 01:16:05.420]  are you ever gonna tell folks about any of that I think you know to be honest
[01:16:05.420 --> 01:16:10.900]  it's such a pretty such an experiential sort of perspective in a sense it's
[01:16:10.900 --> 01:16:15.260]  almost it's too empirical to necessarily try to convince people and we've talked
[01:16:15.260 --> 01:16:19.340]  on your show about certain things that I've heard about and experiences I've
[01:16:19.340 --> 01:16:22.820]  had of you know phone calls from six six six numbers and things that sound
[01:16:22.820 --> 01:16:27.020]  demonic that say they want my soul maybe other and you know maybe other artists
[01:16:27.020 --> 01:16:30.020]  have experienced that well sure that's folks messing with you but you told me
[01:16:30.020 --> 01:16:36.060]  about more than that over an old jolly old England okay I'm just joking let's
[01:16:36.060 --> 01:16:41.300]  just move on let's just move on okay Sean Stone here with us today and we have
[01:16:41.300 --> 01:16:43.780]  limited time when I'm back for a full hour in their future we appreciate his
[01:16:43.780 --> 01:16:48.740]  time getting into your let's get into symbolism first as you want to talk
[01:16:48.740 --> 01:16:51.380]  about that but then you wanted to talk about nuclear fusion how they're trying
[01:16:51.380 --> 01:16:56.340]  to suppress truly free energy shern where all this is going obviously we're
[01:16:56.340 --> 01:17:05.460]  leading towards some type of energy moment where we do reach this this energy
[01:17:05.460 --> 01:17:12.340]  singularity I mean what would you call it yeah maybe singularity could be a good
[01:17:12.340 --> 01:17:15.220]  way to describe it singularity basically as a point right when everything
[01:17:15.220 --> 01:17:18.660]  transforms your entire perspective shifts your your whole understanding if we
[01:17:18.660 --> 01:17:23.100]  achieve this sort of the free energy technologies that have been talked about
[01:17:23.100 --> 01:17:29.220]  by by various people from from Kesha and in Europe to Nassim Hariman and others
[01:17:29.220 --> 01:17:32.220]  and those are the more public ones I've heard guys from behind the scenes who
[01:17:32.220 --> 01:17:36.820]  are working for example out at Montauk at that old lab out there who've said
[01:17:36.820 --> 01:17:39.460]  who described you know various energy that could actually create even time
[01:17:39.460 --> 01:17:44.380]  travel I think if you if we actually achieve this kind of energy it's going
[01:17:44.380 --> 01:17:47.980]  to transform our entire consciousness of reality Alex because remember we are
[01:17:47.980 --> 01:17:52.180]  physically energetic beings we are not really matter right that the level of
[01:17:52.180 --> 01:17:58.300]  of atoms moving and motion we're mostly energy we're we're are actually
[01:17:58.300 --> 01:18:04.260]  organized matter into an energy matrix exactly so the more that we can I think
[01:18:04.260 --> 01:18:07.180]  the energy revolution is important because it'll help transform how we
[01:18:07.180 --> 01:18:11.500]  even perceive our physical environment imagine the nuclear fusion is
[01:18:11.500 --> 01:18:14.980]  accomplished and that we could actually then work on the what's not what's
[01:18:14.980 --> 01:18:18.900]  called the plasma torch which is still being devised but it would be you could
[01:18:18.900 --> 01:18:22.260]  basically close the material system so you can recycle everything on the planet
[01:18:22.260 --> 01:18:31.980]  you could basically take all our good old friend Scott coming in and out go back
[01:18:31.980 --> 01:18:35.180]  and repeat what you said the last 10 seconds about the plasma torch well
[01:18:35.180 --> 01:18:39.220]  but the nuclear fusion concept of closing using the plasma to close the
[01:18:39.220 --> 01:18:43.500]  material cycle so that you could recycle all material on the planet all waste
[01:18:43.500 --> 01:18:48.340]  all waste products across the globe no more shipping off your garbage to China
[01:18:48.340 --> 01:18:52.220]  or sell you know selling off scrap paper whatnot you could actually break it
[01:18:52.220 --> 01:18:56.260]  down to its basic elements and reuse it and you know a lot of technologies have
[01:18:56.260 --> 01:18:59.300]  been developed and are listed as disrupted by the establishment the
[01:18:59.300 --> 01:19:02.980]  cartels the big old companies and banks and they've actually been shelving it
[01:19:02.980 --> 01:19:06.940]  for a long time Allah Raiders the lost Ark the allegory of the huge warehouse
[01:19:06.940 --> 01:19:10.940]  with you know just full of all the things they're hiding I mean do you think
[01:19:10.940 --> 01:19:14.100]  the establishments can ever let us get to that level because they are clearly
[01:19:14.100 --> 01:19:18.460]  suppressing things yes there is a suppression I think even sometimes
[01:19:18.460 --> 01:19:21.300]  people talk about UFO sightings and there are very real people you know
[01:19:21.300 --> 01:19:25.500]  kernels and lieutenants and people from the Air Force and pilots who will tell
[01:19:25.500 --> 01:19:29.300]  you about UFOs they've seen and a lot of that I believe is frankly military tech
[01:19:29.300 --> 01:19:32.780]  like high-end military tech that could have been evolved what do you think
[01:19:32.780 --> 01:19:37.060]  about top moonwalkers top astronauts saying that there were spaceships out
[01:19:37.060 --> 01:19:42.340]  there yeah exactly I mean look again it's whether or not that's next to
[01:19:42.340 --> 01:19:45.500]  a structural component which frankly we could go into all day I was told by
[01:19:45.500 --> 01:19:48.900]  Raymond T and he had national security letters on his wall he had
[01:19:48.900 --> 01:19:52.340]  presidential commendation with his name on it you know for Ronald Reagan and
[01:19:52.340 --> 01:19:55.100]  stuff for being in he was a frontline you know guy running cameras on the moon
[01:19:55.100 --> 01:19:59.020]  skylab he came over a couple times before he thought he was gonna die and he
[01:19:59.020 --> 01:20:03.260]  just was like program he's a great guy he couldn't tell me when I met with him
[01:20:03.260 --> 01:20:06.660]  here at the office a hotel in for like 18 years he's good friends with my dad
[01:20:06.660 --> 01:20:10.140]  and he would get to the point and just couldn't tell me even though he knew he
[01:20:10.140 --> 01:20:13.500]  was about to die his heart was going out he died about month after I met with him
[01:20:13.500 --> 01:20:18.660]  last a few years ago and he said look we want the moon we have there with there's
[01:20:18.660 --> 01:20:22.700]  other technologies there's another NASA and that's what the astronauts saw but
[01:20:22.700 --> 01:20:27.060]  he couldn't even get it all out and and just wouldn't he wouldn't he was he be
[01:20:27.060 --> 01:20:30.180]  ready to tell me and then he wouldn't tell me almost like he'd been programmed
[01:20:30.180 --> 01:20:33.620]  mm-hmm absolutely and again I mean these are the kind of things that we
[01:20:33.620 --> 01:20:37.180]  discuss on bus all the time because we're trying to explain to people look
[01:20:37.180 --> 01:20:40.980]  there's more to this world than you can imagine and so why not allow your
[01:20:40.980 --> 01:20:44.260]  curiosity take hold and listen to these people's stories why do you think he
[01:20:44.260 --> 01:20:46.700]  say was coming to tell me because I go out to dinner with us friends with him
[01:20:46.700 --> 01:20:48.980]  he didn't tell me I'm gonna tell you everything he would get here and then
[01:20:48.980 --> 01:20:52.780]  he just couldn't do it yeah I mean look there could be a mind control component
[01:20:52.780 --> 01:20:56.500]  look if you think Stanley Kubrick in any capacity was involved in shooting the
[01:20:56.500 --> 01:20:59.140]  moon landings and this is not to say that we didn't go to the moon but I
[01:20:59.140 --> 01:21:01.540]  wouldn't I would doubt the government would let you see the actual moon
[01:21:01.540 --> 01:21:04.380]  landing so I wouldn't I wouldn't be so that's what he told me that's what he
[01:21:04.380 --> 01:21:07.140]  basically said is they didn't want to show the public really what we had
[01:21:07.140 --> 01:21:10.580]  exactly so if you take Kubrick and you look at his his body of work what it's
[01:21:10.580 --> 01:21:14.380]  all about it talks about mind control programming like a clock of Orange right
[01:21:14.380 --> 01:21:19.100]  how do you how do you control the minds of people in your society 2001 obviously
[01:21:19.100 --> 01:21:22.900]  the space evolution of space program of our space program and artificial
[01:21:22.900 --> 01:21:26.780]  intelligence which we're now seeing coming up in this century as he said
[01:21:26.780 --> 01:21:32.700]  2001 right 21st century and then yeah so many so many programming components do
[01:21:32.700 --> 01:21:37.620]  you know Vivian Kubrick I don't know her have you interviewed her yet several
[01:21:37.620 --> 01:21:41.220]  times if she doesn't talk to anybody I I don't want to get into it like a
[01:21:41.220 --> 01:21:45.700]  science fiction movie we interview in person in Dallas and on the air here and
[01:21:45.700 --> 01:21:52.980]  then I'm not even gonna get into it the point was talk about because she was like
[01:21:52.980 --> 01:21:55.580]  his protege he was he she was his favorite she was like you know doing a
[01:21:55.580 --> 01:22:00.260]  lot of the movies and the soundtracks and stuff and man I tell you stuff I
[01:22:00.260 --> 01:22:02.900]  learned about Stanley Kubrick I can't I'm not allowed to tell anybody but it
[01:22:02.900 --> 01:22:08.940]  it's mind blowing I mean you notice he's also in the shining is all about
[01:22:08.940 --> 01:22:13.100]  being psychic and you know the Kubrick and the stuff she was telling me I
[01:22:13.100 --> 01:22:15.260]  already had known cuz I'd read a few books about him on you know obviously
[01:22:15.260 --> 01:22:20.220]  really into him especially decades ago I don't waste our time here together but
[01:22:20.220 --> 01:22:22.780]  sometime I'm gonna tell you that stuff obviously was in Congress but just the
[01:22:22.780 --> 01:22:27.220]  generality of it that the CIA the FBI kept visiting him saying how do you know
[01:22:27.220 --> 01:22:34.540]  this how do you know this and he didn't really have contacts Kubrick just knew
[01:22:34.540 --> 01:22:40.900]  I'm gonna say anymore well I mean that's that's also what you could say is the
[01:22:40.900 --> 01:22:43.980]  Illuminati level of consciousness which is what we say it's not Illuminati is
[01:22:43.980 --> 01:22:47.620]  not all bad people say Illuminati like it's all evil no there's different no
[01:22:47.620 --> 01:22:50.500]  it's like they're there's finally communicating with each other yeah
[01:22:50.500 --> 01:22:53.940]  there's there's levels of knowledge and awareness and that's you know I think
[01:22:53.940 --> 01:22:56.900]  that's really what we're talking about here is where does that information come
[01:22:56.900 --> 01:23:00.700]  from even the artist has to tap into something higher which is the well
[01:23:00.700 --> 01:23:04.540]  realm of the imagination or could be astral but you have to tap into
[01:23:04.540 --> 01:23:07.980]  something in order to create in the physical realm
[01:23:08.620 --> 01:23:13.260]  why don't you just tell them go ahead and tell everybody come on just tell them
[01:23:13.260 --> 01:23:19.340]  why don't we have to sit here okay go ahead sorry no so again I mean and so
[01:23:19.340 --> 01:23:23.980]  energy is the key I mean that's kind of what we're trying to drive at I do believe
[01:23:23.980 --> 01:23:30.820]  it's torturing me with a Skype you do believe in your Skype cutout
[01:23:30.820 --> 01:23:35.260]  go ahead I think the government has levels of technology even
[01:23:35.260 --> 01:23:40.140]  involving jump rooms teleportation even involving time travel as have been
[01:23:40.140 --> 01:23:43.460]  alleged on conspiracy theory but people like this who've come out and talked to
[01:23:43.460 --> 01:23:48.260]  me privately on these topics so that's all energetics that means that what we
[01:23:48.260 --> 01:23:52.140]  live in is a matrix of energy and the more that we as human beings become
[01:23:52.140 --> 01:23:56.140]  aware of it and able to hone that energy and manifest and basically manifest
[01:23:56.140 --> 01:24:00.540]  from within our our vision and being honest and true to ourselves we won't
[01:24:00.540 --> 01:24:04.380]  need government of permission approval in future and so they're trying to
[01:24:04.380 --> 01:24:07.180]  suppress human development consciousness because it's gonna end their
[01:24:07.180 --> 01:24:12.220]  control yeah I think that's what we but it's also pretty scary when the public
[01:24:12.220 --> 01:24:17.740]  starts to learn their true potential it is scary especially since the elite of
[01:24:17.740 --> 01:24:21.700]  dumbed everybody down what if some of these dumbed down people start figuring
[01:24:21.700 --> 01:24:27.540]  stuff out dumb down a certain level but then again you could talk about the
[01:24:27.540 --> 01:24:32.260]  unconscious mind and how had he say we all have this tremendous potential in
[01:24:32.260 --> 01:24:36.180]  us and you know even look at the the elite utilizing religion and
[01:24:36.180 --> 01:24:39.540]  fundamentalism and these insane belief systems and that's what we're seeing
[01:24:39.540 --> 01:24:42.860]  playing out in the class civilizations from formal they want the most dumb
[01:24:42.860 --> 01:24:47.820]  down religious programming they can like radical Islam and stuff to overwrite
[01:24:47.820 --> 01:24:51.660]  the Middle East most radical dumb down Christianity to dominate I mean that
[01:24:51.660 --> 01:24:56.140]  they're truly trying to sabotage the consciousness correct correct and the
[01:24:56.140 --> 01:25:00.420]  same time you could say that it's also going to promote and spark the good
[01:25:00.420 --> 01:25:04.260]  people to retaliate against that to the real Muslims the real Christians the
[01:25:04.260 --> 01:25:09.260]  real Jews the real I agree that retaliation is already happening where
[01:25:09.260 --> 01:25:12.460]  do you see do you believe we've entered the epic battle or is this just the
[01:25:12.460 --> 01:25:17.700]  first shockwaves of it I think we're in it I think this is it I think it's
[01:25:17.700 --> 01:25:20.220]  getting heavy and you can feel it energetically it's getting heavy they're
[01:25:20.220 --> 01:25:23.460]  trying to push this world war and I think that the good are standing up in the
[01:25:23.460 --> 01:25:26.900]  conscious conscious ones are stopping it are stopping it because we could have
[01:25:26.900 --> 01:25:32.140]  been in World War by now frankly over Syria let's talk about that I mean you've
[01:25:32.140 --> 01:25:35.700]  been all over the world you've done a lot of research into it the West is
[01:25:35.700 --> 01:25:39.220]  moving US forces and they're actually battling Russians now for every year in
[01:25:39.220 --> 01:25:45.300]  Ukraine it's just wild aggression the elites really are and I think to say
[01:25:45.300 --> 01:25:48.940]  America is the bad actor because it's more complex than that but these evil
[01:25:48.940 --> 01:25:54.980]  forces really are trying to start a large war it's old I mean look it's we
[01:25:54.980 --> 01:25:58.540]  we've talked about this before the New World Order agenda going back to the
[01:25:58.540 --> 01:26:01.620]  start of the 20th century it's the British Empire basically saying look
[01:26:01.620 --> 01:26:04.460]  the British Empire is coming to its end how do we keep it going we're gonna
[01:26:04.460 --> 01:26:08.660]  incorporate America into the British Empire and I think my dad's untold
[01:26:08.660 --> 01:26:13.300]  history series also have to explain that that the British Empire strategy was
[01:26:13.300 --> 01:26:17.820]  to bring America into its fold basically vis-a-vis the Russians who really
[01:26:17.820 --> 01:26:21.020]  should not be our enemies the Russians are very similar to America they have
[01:26:21.020 --> 01:26:24.860]  this huge landmass they're industrious people they have an ancient civilization
[01:26:24.860 --> 01:26:27.620]  they're not trying to conquer the planet they don't need the planet they have all
[01:26:27.620 --> 01:26:31.880]  the resources they need internally but they want the stability of let's be
[01:26:31.880 --> 01:26:36.100]  clear exactly they sold the intelligentsia in the 30s and 40s let's merge
[01:26:36.100 --> 01:26:39.260]  with Russia and have world peace because the globalists had taken it over and put
[01:26:39.260 --> 01:26:43.220]  in communism we were gonna be merging with their own creation but but now
[01:26:43.220 --> 01:26:46.780]  Russia has shaken free of that to a great extent and has really become the
[01:26:46.780 --> 01:26:51.980]  wild card yet again from a European globalist based takeover like Napoleon
[01:26:51.980 --> 01:26:57.180]  Hitler so so again Russia again holds out as the wild card as the two sex you
[01:26:57.180 --> 01:27:01.660]  agree with that statement yes absolutely I think Russia China the whole bricks
[01:27:01.660 --> 01:27:06.060]  nation the bricks banking concept is important because ideally they're talking
[01:27:06.060 --> 01:27:09.340]  about development right promoting development in industry and that's
[01:27:09.340 --> 01:27:12.540]  what we've shut down in our country that's one thing that really like people
[01:27:12.540 --> 01:27:16.020]  aren't talking about is we've been deindustrialized literally intentionally
[01:27:16.020 --> 01:27:19.420]  they have shut down our industry industries they've destroyed our working
[01:27:19.420 --> 01:27:22.500]  class they're working on destroying our middle class right our infrastructure is
[01:27:22.500 --> 01:27:27.460]  going to shit and that's just excuse me I must say that word but really we're
[01:27:27.460 --> 01:27:32.220]  on that path right now and it's a very dark path for America so as opposed to
[01:27:32.220 --> 01:27:36.180]  focusing on bringing up and raising up our American economy internally and our
[01:27:36.180 --> 01:27:40.140]  own people in our own market where why we focused on what McDonald's wants and
[01:27:40.140 --> 01:27:44.060]  what the oil companies want to miss entire global corporate agenda that has
[01:27:44.060 --> 01:27:49.100]  nothing to do with the actual American wage work wage employee doesn't help our
[01:27:49.100 --> 01:27:52.740]  wages only helps the overall banking system they can offer us more debt more
[01:27:52.740 --> 01:27:58.660]  and that's that's supposed to replace our wages it can't work Wow we've only got
[01:27:58.660 --> 01:28:01.500]  two minutes left I'm gonna be on your show today appreciate you having me on
[01:28:01.500 --> 01:28:06.580]  with that again Sean stones our guest paranormal activity security squad I
[01:28:06.580 --> 01:28:10.420]  want to play a clip from this if we have that ready then have you described the
[01:28:10.420 --> 01:28:23.340]  new piece that you're doing this I guess satire here it is yeah I found you

[01:29:24.300 --> 01:29:26.300]  This is what's really interesting.

[01:29:28.300 --> 01:29:29.300]  Go ahead.
[01:29:29.300 --> 01:29:31.300]  For an, yeah, Paramount TV Security Squad.
[01:29:31.300 --> 01:29:33.300]  It's a film where we'll be releasing online.
[01:29:33.300 --> 01:29:39.300]  We talked about the destruction of this overall studio complex by releasing movies online through, you know, through self-distribution.
[01:29:39.300 --> 01:29:44.300]  And our own platform is writing, creating clips and whatnot to make things viral and accessing the market.
[01:29:44.300 --> 01:29:46.300]  But this film itself will get you into the dimension.
[01:29:46.300 --> 01:29:47.300]  It's exciting.
[01:29:47.300 --> 01:29:49.300]  I want to have you back on Paranormal Activity Security Squad.
[01:29:49.300 --> 01:29:50.300]  Thank you so much.
[01:29:50.300 --> 01:29:52.300]  We've got Kathleen Willey coming on with the...
[01:29:52.300 --> 01:29:53.300]  The GCN...
[01:29:53.300 --> 01:29:54.300]  Clinton Rape Train.
[01:29:54.300 --> 01:29:55.300]  Stay with us.
[01:29:55.300 --> 01:29:56.300]  Thank you, Sean.
[01:29:56.300 --> 01:29:58.300]  I'll be on your show today, brother.
[01:29:58.300 --> 01:30:05.300]  It's been revealed a secret 291 code is being used in Sweden to cover up thousands of crimes involving migrants.
[01:30:05.300 --> 01:30:12.300]  According to a report in a Swedish newspaper, around 5,000 incidents have been kept secret for the last four months,
[01:30:12.300 --> 01:30:17.300]  including hundreds of cases of violence, assaults, two terror threats, and four rapes.
[01:30:17.300 --> 01:30:21.300]  The incidents have been covered up because of a directive from the National Operational Department
[01:30:21.300 --> 01:30:25.300]  that any information pertaining to the behavior of refugees be censored.
[01:30:25.300 --> 01:30:31.300]  Last month, it was also reported that police weren't to use descriptions of refugee criminals so as not to appear racist.
[01:30:31.300 --> 01:30:38.300]  And Germany's top broadcaster, ZDF, is also refusing to run crime stories about Muslim rape suspects,
[01:30:38.300 --> 01:30:43.300]  because in the words of editor-in-chief, we don't want to inflame the situation and spread the bad mood.
[01:30:43.300 --> 01:30:48.300]  And the former head of ZDF revealed the station takes orders from the government on what to report,
[01:30:48.300 --> 01:30:53.300]  and that journalists are not allowed to say anything negative about the refugees.
[01:30:53.300 --> 01:31:02.300]  You can find more reports at Infowars.com.
[01:31:23.300 --> 01:31:28.300]  That's InfowarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[01:31:54.300 --> 01:32:00.300]  And it's that type of behavior that spurred me to do the research to develop a true nutraceutical formula
[01:32:00.300 --> 01:32:04.300]  that was designed to smooth out and help children focus.
[01:32:04.300 --> 01:32:07.300]  All of our children are hit with modern mind control.
[01:32:07.300 --> 01:32:10.300]  Television, music, fast food, GMOs, sugars, you name it,
[01:32:10.300 --> 01:32:13.300]  young humans have not yet developed their nervous system
[01:32:13.300 --> 01:32:17.300]  and are being hammered daily by globalist concoctions.
[01:32:17.300 --> 01:32:23.300]  It's no wonder they can't focus and calm down and then are put on dangerous psychotropic drugs.
[01:32:23.300 --> 01:32:27.300]  Working with my team, we set out to find the best formula with the highest quality ingredients
[01:32:27.300 --> 01:32:29.300]  that children would actually like and take.
[01:32:29.300 --> 01:32:33.300]  We worked with the leading manufacturer in nutritional supplements that are safe for children
[01:32:33.300 --> 01:32:37.300]  to bring you the most affordable and powerful calming formula out there,
[01:32:37.300 --> 01:32:42.300]  introducing child ease with herbs and calming extracts like chamomile.
[01:32:42.300 --> 01:32:47.300]  And lemon balm and essential nutrients that taste great.

[01:33:01.300 --> 01:33:06.300]  Matter of fact, it's safe to say that they would rather switch.
[01:33:06.300 --> 01:33:15.300]  Then fight.
[01:33:15.300 --> 01:33:21.300]  The Alex Jones Show, because there is a war on for your mind.
[01:33:21.300 --> 01:33:31.300]  Monday through Friday, from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Central, we're here broadcasting live worldwide.
[01:33:31.300 --> 01:33:36.300]  I'm your host Alex Jones. Don't forget Infowars Nightly News.
[01:33:36.300 --> 01:33:39.300]  5 nights a week, 7 o'clock Central Standard Time.
[01:33:39.300 --> 01:33:45.300]  And then of course this Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m. Central, the live Sunday radio slash TV broadcast as well,
[01:33:45.300 --> 01:33:48.300]  hosted out of the Situation Room.
[01:33:48.300 --> 01:33:54.300]  Coming up after our guest leaves us,
[01:33:54.300 --> 01:33:58.300]  World Economy seems trapped in death spirals.
[01:33:58.300 --> 01:34:05.300]  CNBC, Chicago Stock Exchange says it's being sold to Chinese-led group.
[01:34:05.300 --> 01:34:08.300]  And more. This is the amazing type of stuff.
[01:34:08.300 --> 01:34:13.300]  Bernie Sanders tells the third world populations they can't have vacations, cars or air conditioning.
[01:34:13.300 --> 01:34:15.300]  He's so liberal and socialist like Bernie Sanders.
[01:34:15.300 --> 01:34:25.300]  But Obama has spent $74 million on taxpayers' money on holidays alone.
[01:34:25.300 --> 01:34:31.300]  But that's okay because they're the ruling elite.
[01:34:31.300 --> 01:34:39.300]  Now, coming up in a moment, one of the victims of the Clinton abuse train, Kathleen Willey joins us,
[01:34:39.300 --> 01:34:41.300]  who never wanted to speak out.
[01:34:41.300 --> 01:34:46.300]  She's a very valiant lady, but got subpoenaed, got drugged into it, and the Clintons attacked her.
[01:34:46.300 --> 01:34:48.300]  And now it's becoming a big issue.
[01:34:48.300 --> 01:34:56.300]  I mean, is Clinton coming towards his Bill Cosby critical mass moment?
[01:34:56.300 --> 01:35:08.300]  And I've seen Kathleen and others who had a lot of interviews, but make the comment that, you know, how dare they have Clinton out there on the trail?
[01:35:08.300 --> 01:35:12.300]  And why would women in America go for Hillary just because she's a woman?
[01:35:12.300 --> 01:35:14.300]  I mean, does she really stand up for women?
[01:35:14.300 --> 01:35:16.300]  How about for the Constitution?
[01:35:16.300 --> 01:35:18.300]  I don't care what you are, man or woman.
[01:35:18.300 --> 01:35:21.300]  As long as you're constitutionalist, but she joins us.
[01:35:21.300 --> 01:35:25.300]  I'm not going to go over her whole bio, but the Clintons just won't go away.
[01:35:25.300 --> 01:35:27.300]  So it's like a blast from the past.
[01:35:27.300 --> 01:35:34.300]  We had her on several times back in the 90s, and then I think once since then when the Clintons re-emerged, and we know she's sick of this like everybody else is.
[01:35:34.300 --> 01:35:36.300]  But the Clintons just keep coming back.
[01:35:36.300 --> 01:35:38.300]  A scandaladay.com.
[01:35:38.300 --> 01:35:44.300]  Kathleen Willey was a White House volunteer aide who was forced to go on 60 minutes.
[01:35:44.300 --> 01:35:47.300]  And it's actually assault of her in 93.
[01:35:47.300 --> 01:35:51.300]  And then of course I started coming out after she got subpoenaed and brought in and the rest of it.
[01:35:51.300 --> 01:35:52.300]  She's had a lot of courage.
[01:35:52.300 --> 01:35:55.300]  Some of the other women, famous women have said they're afraid they're going to be killed.
[01:35:55.300 --> 01:35:57.300]  They're not going to commit suicide.
[01:35:57.300 --> 01:36:00.300]  And of course they've tried to financially go after a destroyer.
[01:36:00.300 --> 01:36:04.300]  That's why it's important to get this story out and also try to support Kathleen Willey.
[01:36:04.300 --> 01:36:06.300]  Her book is available on Amazon.
[01:36:06.300 --> 01:36:07.300]  You name it on her website.
[01:36:07.300 --> 01:36:10.300]  Target caught in the crosshairs of Bill and Hillary Clinton.
[01:36:10.300 --> 01:36:11.300]  Kathleen Willey.
[01:36:11.300 --> 01:36:14.300]  So Kathleen, thank you for joining us.
[01:36:14.300 --> 01:36:17.300]  We see some of the tabloid covers talking about Hillary for prison.
[01:36:17.300 --> 01:36:21.300]  And we see Congress wondering why she hasn't been indicted yet.
[01:36:21.300 --> 01:36:26.300]  But they run the Justice Department overall before we get into your story for folks.
[01:36:26.300 --> 01:36:27.300]  What is this like?
[01:36:27.300 --> 01:36:29.300]  I mean, it's traumatizing for me.
[01:36:29.300 --> 01:36:31.300]  And I'm not just saying that to be a drama queen.
[01:36:31.300 --> 01:36:33.300]  I'm sick of the Clintons.
[01:36:33.300 --> 01:36:34.300]  I've been on there 21 years.
[01:36:34.300 --> 01:36:38.300]  I've been covering them since the day I got into TV and radio.
[01:36:38.300 --> 01:36:40.300]  And I know how bad they are.
[01:36:40.300 --> 01:36:47.300]  And it's just sick to see some of the dumb down constituents in this weird relationship with them that isn't even there.
[01:36:47.300 --> 01:36:53.300]  It's like watching cult followers, you know, drink the Jim Jones cyanide lace Kool-Aid.
[01:36:53.300 --> 01:36:55.300]  It's very, very sad to watch.
[01:36:55.300 --> 01:37:00.300]  I mean, what's it like for you to actually been assaulted by this guy?
[01:37:00.300 --> 01:37:03.300]  Well, first of all, it's a pleasure to be on your show.
[01:37:03.300 --> 01:37:04.300]  Thank you.
[01:37:04.300 --> 01:37:08.300]  What is it like for me?
[01:37:08.300 --> 01:37:18.300]  I think, you know, I pretty much put it behind me as best I can.
[01:37:18.300 --> 01:37:22.300]  Things certainly quieted down there for a long time.
[01:37:22.300 --> 01:37:33.300]  But when she started talking about running for president, I just thought to myself, I'm like you, when are these people going to just leave?
[01:37:33.300 --> 01:37:38.300]  It's just they never give up.
[01:37:38.300 --> 01:37:40.300]  They are always in our faces.
[01:37:40.300 --> 01:37:43.300]  I mean, we can't get rid of them.
[01:37:43.300 --> 01:37:47.300]  And that's why I had one of those 3AM aha moments.
[01:37:47.300 --> 01:37:51.300]  I did a short interview right before she announced.
[01:37:51.300 --> 01:37:55.300]  And I said, it's going to be nothing but a scandal today.
[01:37:55.300 --> 01:38:01.300]  And like I said, 3AM moments, I said, yeah, that's something that's a good website name.
[01:38:01.300 --> 01:38:09.300]  And I remember telling the administrator, the guy who helped me, I said, you know, there'll be some days when there's not a lot of news.
[01:38:09.300 --> 01:38:11.300]  I'll dig some stuff up.
[01:38:11.300 --> 01:38:12.300]  Well, you know what?
[01:38:12.300 --> 01:38:17.300]  It made it real easy for me because a lot of days, there have been three and four scandals that have come up.
[01:38:17.300 --> 01:38:35.300]  But I think the thing that really, really, really set me off wasn't anything with that commercial part, saying that if you've been raped or sexually assaulted, you have the right to be believed and you have the right to be listened to.
[01:38:35.300 --> 01:38:42.300]  And I am here, we are here, and I just thought to myself, I can't believe what I'm watching.
[01:38:42.300 --> 01:38:43.300]  I really did.
[01:38:43.300 --> 01:38:51.300]  I had to rewind that commercial five times to make sure that I wasn't dreaming.
[01:38:51.300 --> 01:38:57.300]  And I just thought of all the people in this world to come out and say something like that.
[01:38:57.300 --> 01:39:03.300]  The woman has no moral core, period.
[01:39:03.300 --> 01:39:11.300]  She will do anything, say anything, whatever it takes to get what she wants.
[01:39:11.300 --> 01:39:18.300]  Now, looking at this, and we have one of the Clinton's victims here with us, one of the more prominent ones who got sucked into all of this.
[01:39:18.300 --> 01:39:22.300]  Kathleen Willey, the book target.
[01:39:22.300 --> 01:39:26.300]  When we look at these people, you know, there you are working on the White House, you're not against the Democrats.
[01:39:26.300 --> 01:39:27.300]  You don't have an axe to grind.
[01:39:27.300 --> 01:39:29.300]  Most of these other women didn't either.
[01:39:29.300 --> 01:39:31.300]  He settled some of these cases.
[01:39:31.300 --> 01:39:37.300]  And then they turn around and these so-called liberal women don't back you up because it's really just about a power structure.
[01:39:37.300 --> 01:39:38.300]  It's not about empowering women.
[01:39:38.300 --> 01:39:41.300]  They're trying to draft women out of the military and that's the Democrats.
[01:39:41.300 --> 01:39:43.300]  I guess they want to own women.
[01:39:43.300 --> 01:39:54.300]  But looking at how they operate, I think it was Roger Stone, one of Trump's advisors that made the point that Bill Clinton rapes them physically and then Hillary rapes them psychologically.
[01:39:54.300 --> 01:39:57.300]  Being in the White House, they say she was co-president.
[01:39:57.300 --> 01:39:59.300]  Now they say maybe she did more than he did.
[01:39:59.300 --> 01:40:01.300]  This will be her third and fourth term.
[01:40:01.300 --> 01:40:04.300]  She'll outdo Roosevelt if she gets in.
[01:40:04.300 --> 01:40:06.300]  Who really ran things?
[01:40:06.300 --> 01:40:07.300]  What was it like?
[01:40:07.300 --> 01:40:08.300]  Who are these people?
[01:40:08.300 --> 01:40:13.300]  Who's worse, Bill or Hillary?
[01:40:13.300 --> 01:40:17.300]  Well, that's a hard one.
[01:40:17.300 --> 01:40:27.300]  I mean, he's a pervert and a predator and a rapist and she's the enabler.
[01:40:27.300 --> 01:40:31.300]  So that's hard for me to say.
[01:40:31.300 --> 01:40:37.300]  I mean, you can get a devil to do.
[01:40:37.300 --> 01:40:45.300]  He is charming and he does have a lot of people drawn to him.
[01:40:45.300 --> 01:40:48.300]  But she's totally unlikable.
[01:40:48.300 --> 01:40:51.300]  Totally and completely unlikable.
[01:40:51.300 --> 01:40:57.300]  And I've seen her rant and her rave and her appearance.
[01:40:57.300 --> 01:41:00.300]  I mean, I didn't see her a lot.
[01:41:00.300 --> 01:41:04.300]  I never saw them while I worked in the White House.
[01:41:04.300 --> 01:41:06.300]  It's really funny.
[01:41:06.300 --> 01:41:11.300]  My first position there was in the East Wing in the social office.
[01:41:11.300 --> 01:41:16.300]  And that is where all the former First Lady's offices were.
[01:41:16.300 --> 01:41:23.300]  And, you know, she as co-president demanded that Shopee have an office in the West Wing,
[01:41:23.300 --> 01:41:25.300]  which is what she got.
[01:41:25.300 --> 01:41:32.300]  So our job in the social office was, I mean, all the things social,
[01:41:32.300 --> 01:41:36.300]  receptions, the Christmas at the White House,
[01:41:36.300 --> 01:41:38.300]  state centers, you name it.
[01:41:38.300 --> 01:41:41.300]  Christmas parties every night of the month of December.
[01:41:41.300 --> 01:41:43.300]  So you're a charming, you know, person.
[01:41:43.300 --> 01:41:45.300]  You're into hospitality.
[01:41:45.300 --> 01:41:47.300]  You're in there because you do have a great record.
[01:41:47.300 --> 01:41:48.300]  You're working at the White House.
[01:41:48.300 --> 01:41:49.300]  You're looking for trouble.
[01:41:49.300 --> 01:41:51.300]  By the way, I should add, since the last time you were on with us,
[01:41:51.300 --> 01:41:54.300]  I know you were on Megan Kelly and pointed out you've had a neck injury.
[01:41:54.300 --> 01:41:58.300]  I just appreciate you even being able to come on and also know your speech is great.
[01:41:58.300 --> 01:42:01.300]  But I know it affects a little bit of folks who are wondering why you sound a little bit different
[01:42:01.300 --> 01:42:04.300]  than the last time you were on.
[01:42:04.300 --> 01:42:05.300]  I do?
[01:42:05.300 --> 01:42:06.300]  Just a little bit.
[01:42:06.300 --> 01:42:09.300]  But I mean, your phone's a little bit breaking up, too.
[01:42:09.300 --> 01:42:12.300]  But maybe we just back off of it a tiny bit.
[01:42:12.300 --> 01:42:17.300]  But what I'm saying is we appreciate you, despite the fact that you have a neck injury coming on the show.
[01:42:17.300 --> 01:42:19.300]  I want my spader down.
[01:42:19.300 --> 01:42:20.300]  Okay, good, good.
[01:42:20.300 --> 01:42:22.300]  Now your phone just got a lot clearer.
[01:42:22.300 --> 01:42:24.300]  My phone's got a lot clearer.
[01:42:24.300 --> 01:42:25.300]  I'm sorry.
[01:42:25.300 --> 01:42:26.300]  I'm fine now.
[01:42:26.300 --> 01:42:27.300]  Fantastic.
[01:42:27.300 --> 01:42:36.300]  So let's go back then to the White House as you were continuing, please.
[01:42:36.300 --> 01:42:38.300]  I guess, yeah.
[01:42:38.300 --> 01:42:44.300]  We never really saw them a lot.
[01:42:44.300 --> 01:42:53.300]  I thought I would see her more because when I moved from the East Wing and got a part-time job in the West Wing,
[01:42:53.300 --> 01:42:56.300]  her office was right next to mine.
[01:42:56.300 --> 01:43:03.300]  So the elevator opened right at the door to the council's office where I was.
[01:43:03.300 --> 01:43:06.300]  So I would see her every day she came in.
[01:43:06.300 --> 01:43:12.300]  And some days you could hear screaming, you know, donor tantrums.
[01:43:12.300 --> 01:43:21.300]  But I never really had a whole lot of contact with her.
[01:43:21.300 --> 01:43:34.300]  But the same thing happened to me that happened to Lonita when she realized, when she tells the story after she was raped by Bill Clinton.
[01:43:34.300 --> 01:43:43.300]  But a couple weeks later, Hillary shot her out and grabbed her hand and thanked her for all you're doing.
[01:43:43.300 --> 01:43:48.300]  And a woman just knows these things.
[01:43:48.300 --> 01:43:54.300]  And that's when she said, she knows all about what he did to me.
[01:43:54.300 --> 01:44:01.300]  And she was very frightened because she felt intimidated by what the woman was saying and the look on her face.
[01:44:01.300 --> 01:44:11.300]  Well, I was never really, I mean, I was in her presence during campaigning, a number of fundraisers.
[01:44:11.300 --> 01:44:17.300]  But he was more a friend of my life husband and mine than she was.
[01:44:17.300 --> 01:44:25.300]  But the really first formal introduction I had with her was very weird.
[01:44:25.300 --> 01:44:31.300]  And after the job that I had, I had gone and asked for a part-time job.
[01:44:31.300 --> 01:44:36.300]  And, you know, if you remember, that was the same day that my husband took his own life.
[01:44:36.300 --> 01:44:40.300]  But I did get a part-time job in the council's office.
[01:44:40.300 --> 01:44:50.300]  But a couple years later, I was invited to be a part of two delegations, the Two World Summits, which I thought was kind of odd.
[01:44:50.300 --> 01:44:59.300]  And I realized now it was just something, it was one of those things to make sure that I stay quiet about what had happened in the Oval Office.
[01:44:59.300 --> 01:45:03.300]  So that's when I met her in Copenhagen.
[01:45:03.300 --> 01:45:09.300]  And she was, that was right after they were elected and they were very popular and rock stars.
[01:45:09.300 --> 01:45:15.300]  And the huge big concert hall, you know, auditorium was huge.
[01:45:15.300 --> 01:45:19.300]  I mean, standing room only for her speech.
[01:45:19.300 --> 01:45:25.300]  And the people that actually are in the delegation, there are about 40 of them.
[01:45:25.300 --> 01:45:28.300]  And they wanted to do all the heavy lifting.
[01:45:28.300 --> 01:45:36.300]  I mean, they worked until the wee hours of the morning, sorting out all the language every three years, you know, and they worked really hard.
[01:45:36.300 --> 01:45:44.300]  And so they asked me if I could try to set up a meeting with her, so they could meet her.
[01:45:44.300 --> 01:45:49.300]  And so I went to her staff and I asked them and they said she was busy.
[01:45:49.300 --> 01:45:52.300]  I kind of got irritated.
[01:45:52.300 --> 01:45:54.300]  I said, well, get on busy, okay?
[01:45:54.300 --> 01:45:58.300]  Because these women, these men and women have really worked hard.
[01:45:58.300 --> 01:45:59.300]  I've seen them.
[01:45:59.300 --> 01:46:00.300]  I've worked with them.
[01:46:00.300 --> 01:46:02.300]  So what happened with Hillary?
[01:46:02.300 --> 01:46:04.300]  And so finally she agreed.
[01:46:04.300 --> 01:46:05.300]  She came in.
[01:46:05.300 --> 01:46:11.300]  She shook everybody's hand and just made nice with people.
[01:46:11.300 --> 01:46:15.300]  You could tell she really wasn't interested in engaging with anybody.
[01:46:15.300 --> 01:46:18.300]  But I was the last person in the whole line.
[01:46:18.300 --> 01:46:24.300]  And I introduced myself as formerly a member of her social office.
[01:46:24.300 --> 01:46:30.300]  And I thought she shook my hand and, you know, and she kept holding my hand.
[01:46:30.300 --> 01:46:35.300]  And I just could tell by the look in her eyes that she knew.
[01:46:35.300 --> 01:46:38.300]  I mean, I just, I just thought that's the first thing I saw.
[01:46:38.300 --> 01:46:41.300]  You understand she made a big intense deal.
[01:46:41.300 --> 01:46:43.300]  I mean, his attack on women is well known.
[01:46:43.300 --> 01:46:46.300]  The raping, settling cases, how he bites them on the face, what he does.
[01:46:46.300 --> 01:46:49.300]  I mean, you got out like compared to a lot of the women that was still on Oterrable and Traumatic,
[01:46:49.300 --> 01:46:51.300]  especially how they persecuted you later.
[01:46:51.300 --> 01:46:54.300]  But is it that he's a sex addict or is he psycho?
[01:46:54.300 --> 01:46:56.300]  Does he like to abuse women?
[01:46:56.300 --> 01:46:57.300]  I mean, what is it?
[01:46:57.300 --> 01:47:03.300]  I think he's, I think that he's a perverted psychopath.
[01:47:03.300 --> 01:47:05.300]  That's what I think he is.
[01:47:05.300 --> 01:47:08.300]  Listen, I know one of you.
[01:47:08.300 --> 01:47:15.300]  And I sat down when I first met her and she told me that whole story, face to face.
[01:47:15.300 --> 01:47:19.300]  And by the time she was done, we were both proud of me.
[01:47:19.300 --> 01:47:25.300]  And I mean, she was just traumatized in telling me that whole story that many years later,
[01:47:25.300 --> 01:47:27.300]  as a day it happened.
[01:47:27.300 --> 01:47:31.300]  And he, he brutally raped that woman.
[01:47:31.300 --> 01:47:34.300]  Okay, I can't say it any clearer than that.
[01:47:34.300 --> 01:47:39.300]  And she's not the only one.
[01:47:39.300 --> 01:47:45.300]  And one of the reasons that I set up my, my website and my face, my Facebook page,
[01:47:45.300 --> 01:47:50.300]  which is a scandal a day, was two things.
[01:47:50.300 --> 01:47:56.300]  To educate the younger voters who were not even born over two young,
[01:47:56.300 --> 01:48:01.300]  when all of this happened in the White House with Monica and everybody else.
[01:48:01.300 --> 01:48:09.300]  And the second, the second, my second mission was to give anybody who had been sexually abused
[01:48:09.300 --> 01:48:15.300]  or raped by Bill Clinton a safe haven to tell their story.
[01:48:15.300 --> 01:48:16.300]  Well, you've done a great job.
[01:48:16.300 --> 01:48:22.300]  Do we have any idea how many women he's raped or attacked or abused?
[01:48:22.300 --> 01:48:27.300]  More than, more than Bill Cosby.
[01:48:27.300 --> 01:48:29.300]  Many more than Bill Cosby.
[01:48:29.300 --> 01:48:32.300]  This is a manifestation of his mental illness or his psychopathic, uh,
[01:48:32.300 --> 01:48:33.300]  a sadistic behavior.
[01:48:33.300 --> 01:48:36.300]  But imagine whatever weirdness he's into as well.
[01:48:36.300 --> 01:48:39.300]  Because I mean, it's so alien to me to force sex on a woman.
[01:48:39.300 --> 01:48:42.300]  I mean, I mean, that's as alien as, you know, I was born on Mars.
[01:48:42.300 --> 01:48:47.300]  Well, what kind, what, I mean, it just goes to show you the caliber of these people.
[01:48:47.300 --> 01:48:53.300]  I mean, look at what, I mean, he traveled around on a private plane
[01:48:53.300 --> 01:49:00.300]  called the Lillia Express with Jeffrey Epstein, who is a convicted pedophile, a felon.
[01:49:00.300 --> 01:49:01.300]  That's right.
[01:49:01.300 --> 01:49:09.300]  They go to Orgy Island, his private island, and he brings in young girls to entertain them.
[01:49:09.300 --> 01:49:14.300]  And when I say young girls, I'm saying underage girls.
[01:49:14.300 --> 01:49:16.300]  He brings in.
[01:49:16.300 --> 01:49:18.300]  Well, there's a couple names for that.
[01:49:18.300 --> 01:49:23.300]  One is human trafficking and the other is pedophilia.
[01:49:23.300 --> 01:49:25.300]  Now, I don't know.
[01:49:25.300 --> 01:49:27.300]  Did you see George Bush doing that?
[01:49:27.300 --> 01:49:28.300]  I couldn't.
[01:49:28.300 --> 01:49:31.300]  Certainly not flying around airplanes with people convicted of it.
[01:49:31.300 --> 01:49:34.300]  Now, expanding on that, that's all, that's all come out in the news.
[01:49:34.300 --> 01:49:38.300]  Is that why the Clintons can't be brought down is because they know where the skeletons are buried
[01:49:38.300 --> 01:49:40.300]  and that other politicians out there.
[01:49:40.300 --> 01:49:42.300]  I think they're going to be brought down.
[01:49:42.300 --> 01:49:46.300]  I have, I have utmost faith in James Comey.
[01:49:46.300 --> 01:49:49.300]  I have followed his career.
[01:49:49.300 --> 01:49:53.300]  He worked here in Richmond with the federal government.
[01:49:53.300 --> 01:49:59.300]  So you have a new FBI director's willing to take on the Clinton pedophile program.
[01:49:59.300 --> 01:50:00.300]  Yeah.
[01:50:00.300 --> 01:50:01.300]  Yeah.
[01:50:01.300 --> 01:50:02.300]  He is.
[01:50:02.300 --> 01:50:03.300]  He is.
[01:50:03.300 --> 01:50:05.300]  I was just very interested.
[01:50:05.300 --> 01:50:06.300]  He caught my interest.
[01:50:06.300 --> 01:50:15.300]  We had a real bad problem in recent drugs and murders and he was a tough nut.
[01:50:15.300 --> 01:50:18.300]  And he's very imposed.
[01:50:18.300 --> 01:50:26.300]  But he, he's six foot eight and he's got a wonderful reputation.
[01:50:26.300 --> 01:50:27.300]  I know this.
[01:50:27.300 --> 01:50:28.300]  I know this, Kathleen.
[01:50:28.300 --> 01:50:29.300]  There's got to be some point.
[01:50:29.300 --> 01:50:30.300]  I know our government's corrupt.
[01:50:30.300 --> 01:50:31.300]  We're enough is enough.
[01:50:31.300 --> 01:50:37.300]  I mean, and I mean, does, does Bill have to rape a, you know, 15 year old girl in the White House steps
[01:50:37.300 --> 01:50:38.300]  before anybody does it?
[01:50:38.300 --> 01:50:42.300]  Or maybe they'll say she's being sexist against the Democrats if we don't like accept it.
[01:50:42.300 --> 01:50:45.300]  I mean, maybe they'll say pass the law to make it legal for him to.
[01:50:45.300 --> 01:50:48.300]  I just don't get why the feminist movement.
[01:50:48.300 --> 01:50:49.300]  You're right.
[01:50:49.300 --> 01:50:52.300]  We need to get rid of these people.
[01:50:52.300 --> 01:50:53.300]  Kathleen Willoughby got to go to break.
[01:50:53.300 --> 01:50:55.300]  We'll do five more minutes with the other side.
[01:50:55.300 --> 01:51:24.300]  This is really important information, obviously folks.
[01:51:25.300 --> 01:51:31.300]  You've heard infidel body armor ads for years.
[01:51:31.300 --> 01:51:35.300]  You've thought about investing in body armor, but just haven't found the time.
[01:51:35.300 --> 01:51:36.300]  Stop.
[01:51:36.300 --> 01:51:39.300]  Now is the time you want the industry leader.

[01:54:14.300 --> 01:54:16.300]  We are back live in a few minutes left
[01:54:16.300 --> 01:54:19.300]  with one of the main Clinton victims who then helped organize women to fight back
[01:54:19.300 --> 01:54:22.300]  once the Clintons tried to come after her and others.
[01:54:22.300 --> 01:54:25.300]  Kathleen Willey, the book's target. We're going to talk to her in a moment.
[01:54:25.300 --> 01:54:32.300]  Don't forget, ladies and gentlemen, that we have amazing pro-second amendment t-shirts for men and women.
[01:54:32.300 --> 01:54:37.300]  We have shirts tailored for women that are designer quality with gold foil Molan Labe,

[01:55:01.300 --> 01:55:05.300]  But just to come and take it in a little star all off the Texas Revolution.
[01:55:05.300 --> 01:55:09.300]  Free orders on $50 or more.
[01:55:09.300 --> 01:55:14.300]  And we've introduced the new Vitality Stamina Labido.
[01:55:14.300 --> 01:55:18.300]  You name it, what herbs do, in my opinion, is so much better than, quote, medicine.
[01:55:18.300 --> 01:55:22.300]  To say in my experience, it's incredible, the stamina, the energy, the weight loss,
[01:55:22.300 --> 01:55:26.300]  just anthroplex, supermilial vitality, introductory offer.
[01:55:26.300 --> 01:55:31.300]  And by the way, a new product, because we never know what people are going to like.
[01:55:31.300 --> 01:55:33.300]  I just produce whatever I think's the best.
[01:55:33.300 --> 01:55:35.300]  Everything's a hit, but some things are a super hit.
[01:55:35.300 --> 01:55:37.300]  Stuff usually sells out in three, four weeks.
[01:55:37.300 --> 01:55:39.300]  Some products come out and sell out in a week.
[01:55:39.300 --> 01:55:41.300]  DNA4s came back in, sold out in three days.
[01:55:41.300 --> 01:55:42.300]  I thought it'd be a week.
[01:55:42.300 --> 01:55:44.300]  More is coming in.
[01:55:44.300 --> 01:55:47.300]  It's going to sell out by the middle of next week at current sales rates.
[01:55:47.300 --> 01:55:53.300]  So try a bottle of DNA4s, M4wars.com, and know that you're fighting the very tip of the spear
[01:55:53.300 --> 01:55:55.300]  in the fight against the globalist.
[01:55:55.300 --> 01:56:05.300]  M4wars.com is the subpage of the shopping cart with a little high quality nutraceuticals.
[01:56:05.300 --> 01:56:17.300]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, anthroplex is available at M4warslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:56:17.300 --> 01:56:19.300]  Let's go ahead now and go back to Kathleen Willey.
[01:56:19.300 --> 01:56:22.300]  Seeing them back, seeing them return.
[01:56:22.300 --> 01:56:29.300]  I'd even forgot about Clinton and all these Democrats flying around on that jet with their top donor to that pedophile island.
[01:56:29.300 --> 01:56:32.300]  I mean, you can't make, that's been on CNN and Fox News.
[01:56:32.300 --> 01:56:34.300]  Why do you think she hasn't gotten in trouble yet?
[01:56:34.300 --> 01:56:35.300]  Is it the blackmail?
[01:56:35.300 --> 01:56:38.300]  And Clinton looks like he's on Death's Doorstep.
[01:56:38.300 --> 01:56:39.300]  He looks like a reanimated...
[01:56:39.300 --> 01:56:40.300]  He does.
[01:56:40.300 --> 01:56:42.300]  Of course, he's got one putt in the grave.
[01:56:42.300 --> 01:56:44.300]  You know what?
[01:56:44.300 --> 01:56:52.300]  This is very unkind of me, but I don't have one ounce of pity or sorrow for either one of them.
[01:56:52.300 --> 01:56:53.300]  I just totally don't.
[01:56:53.300 --> 01:57:02.300]  They have done so many bad things and hurt so many innocent people that I just think, you know,
[01:57:02.300 --> 01:57:04.300]  karma's a good thing.
[01:57:04.300 --> 01:57:07.300]  And I think it's catching up with them.
[01:57:07.300 --> 01:57:09.300]  And not just...
[01:57:09.300 --> 01:57:13.300]  I mean, everybody's talking about, you know, is Comey...
[01:57:13.300 --> 01:57:16.300]  I think Comey is doing a good job.
[01:57:16.300 --> 01:57:18.300]  Everybody's saying, well, what's taking so long?
[01:57:18.300 --> 01:57:20.300]  And they ought to be in jail.
[01:57:20.300 --> 01:57:23.300]  And I just have this kind of, you know, on my website.
[01:57:23.300 --> 01:57:27.300]  It's just to remind people, this man has a lot on his plate.
[01:57:27.300 --> 01:57:36.300]  And he also is well-respected, highly regarded, he's patriotic, honest to a fault.
[01:57:36.300 --> 01:57:41.300]  And, you know, I saw him a couple of weeks ago before the Senate subcommittee.
[01:57:41.300 --> 01:57:46.300]  And he sat down, and all six foot eight of them standing there were taking the oath, you know,
[01:57:46.300 --> 01:57:47.300]  before he sat down.
[01:57:47.300 --> 01:57:49.300]  And he looked at this as the committee.
[01:57:49.300 --> 01:57:53.300]  He said, ladies and gentlemen, the first thing I want to say is this.
[01:57:53.300 --> 01:57:55.300]  I don't give a rip about politics.
[01:57:55.300 --> 01:57:58.300]  My agents don't give a rip about politics.
[01:57:58.300 --> 01:58:01.300]  But we do give a rip about the truth.
[01:58:01.300 --> 01:58:03.300]  And the truth is what you'll get.
[01:58:03.300 --> 01:58:05.300]  And I believe that.
[01:58:05.300 --> 01:58:10.300]  I believe everything he says, I think he keeps this with, you know, plays his cards close.
[01:58:10.300 --> 01:58:12.300]  A lot of folks say that, and we'll see if it really happens.
[01:58:12.300 --> 01:58:15.300]  He does have a good record compared to some of these other directors.
[01:58:15.300 --> 01:58:18.300]  The last director, you know, now over there, the one before that,
[01:58:18.300 --> 01:58:23.300]  running around, covering stuff up at Penn State, which is right up Clinton's alley, obviously.
[01:58:23.300 --> 01:58:25.300]  But it sounds like a little sweet on the new FBI director.
[01:58:25.300 --> 01:58:29.300]  And I hope he'll stand up as a knight in shining armor for the women of this country.
[01:58:29.300 --> 01:58:31.300]  But I know you're doing it, Kathleen Willey.
[01:58:31.300 --> 01:58:34.300]  So thank you so much for what you've been up to.
[01:58:34.300 --> 01:58:35.300]  God bless you.
[01:58:35.300 --> 01:58:36.300]  Oh, I forgot to ask you one question.
[01:58:36.300 --> 01:58:37.300]  Stay there for 60 seconds.
[01:58:37.300 --> 01:58:38.300]  I want to ask you about Trump.
[01:58:38.300 --> 01:58:41.300]  I want to ask you if you like how he's been exposing it.
[01:58:41.300 --> 01:58:42.300]  Nobody else has.

[02:00:10.300 --> 02:00:19.300]  The world is a dangerous place, not because of evil, but because of those who look on and do nothing.
[02:00:19.300 --> 02:00:24.300]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:00:24.300 --> 02:00:28.300]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center.
[02:00:28.300 --> 02:00:30.300]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:00:30.300 --> 02:00:35.300]  I don't plan to be a daredevil like stunt drivers or special forces people,
[02:00:35.300 --> 02:00:41.300]  but I'll do what I have to in a situation where I can turn off my fear or use it.
[02:00:41.300 --> 02:00:45.300]  But I'd be more afraid of not fighting tyranny and letting it win.
[02:00:45.300 --> 02:00:47.300]  I mean, that's the real fear intellectually.
[02:00:47.300 --> 02:00:51.300]  That's what you should be afraid of, is letting them fully take over, which they're trying to do.
[02:00:51.300 --> 02:00:54.300]  They want to dominate and totally control.
[02:00:54.300 --> 02:00:58.300]  And so I've forgotten to ask Kathleen Willey, one of the Clinton victims,
[02:00:58.300 --> 02:01:02.300]  one of the most prominent ones that's been speaking out, the most valiantly,
[02:01:02.300 --> 02:01:06.300]  where are the American men? You know, you're talking about James Cooney,
[02:01:06.300 --> 02:01:08.300]  the new FBI director, hoping he'll do something.
[02:01:08.300 --> 02:01:10.300]  And we'll see if that happens.
[02:01:10.300 --> 02:01:12.300]  Let's put pressure on them, obviously, to do their job.
[02:01:12.300 --> 02:01:15.300]  I know it's hard to go up against these crime syndicates.
[02:01:15.300 --> 02:01:20.300]  And then the word is there's a big-scale maiden DC, because she's blackmailing folks right now.
[02:01:20.300 --> 02:01:24.300]  But what do you make of Donald Trump?
[02:01:24.300 --> 02:01:27.300]  He seems to be the only candidate going up against Hillary.
[02:01:27.300 --> 02:01:32.300]  And when she attacks him, saying he's sexist, he's made jokes or whatever before,
[02:01:32.300 --> 02:01:35.300]  and saying, you don't want to go there, lady, with your husband's record of women.
[02:01:35.300 --> 02:01:38.300]  He's like Bill Cosby. She shot her mouth real quick.
[02:01:38.300 --> 02:01:41.300]  It was good to see Trump get back in her face.
[02:01:41.300 --> 02:01:44.300]  I like Trump. He says it like it is.
[02:01:44.300 --> 02:01:51.300]  And I thanked him publicly on an interview that I did for asking him a hard question.
[02:01:51.300 --> 02:01:59.300]  Nobody's brought that up. Nobody. No mainstream media reporter has asked her any of the questions.
[02:01:59.300 --> 02:02:06.300]  I mean, this woman threatened my children's lives, okay? What kind of a mother?
[02:02:06.300 --> 02:02:10.300]  Let's talk about that. I mean, I was getting off in other areas.
[02:02:10.300 --> 02:02:14.300]  Just in the two, three minutes we have left, let's go through what you've witnessed the Clintons do
[02:02:14.300 --> 02:02:17.300]  and what they've personally done to you.
[02:02:17.300 --> 02:02:21.300]  Personally, what they did to me was an accident. Let's talk about that.
[02:02:21.300 --> 02:02:28.300]  Well, after I got the, after I was depended by Paula Jones' attorney, you know,
[02:02:28.300 --> 02:02:34.300]  I was never going to tell that story. That story was going to go to my grave with me.
[02:02:34.300 --> 02:02:43.300]  It's a bad story. But I had told some friends and Paula's lawyers hired an investigator,
[02:02:43.300 --> 02:02:51.300]  they found me, and they subpoenaed me. And my lawyer and I spent months trying to get out of that.
[02:02:51.300 --> 02:02:55.300]  I did not want to have to testify in that. I just didn't want to do it.
[02:02:55.300 --> 02:03:02.300]  And all of a sudden, the president's attorney, Bob Bennett, became our new best friend.
[02:03:02.300 --> 02:03:05.300]  And he was driving down Hood of Richmond couple times a month.
[02:03:05.300 --> 02:03:12.300]  And he was trying, he was trying very hard to get me to sign an affidavit that nothing happened.
[02:03:12.300 --> 02:03:17.300]  And also, he was trying very hard to find out what happened.
[02:03:17.300 --> 02:03:22.300]  And when you wouldn't do it, what happened to your, I mean, how'd she threaten your children?
[02:03:22.300 --> 02:03:25.300]  Well, a lot of things started to happen around here.
[02:03:25.300 --> 02:03:30.300]  I live in a very rural place, I mean, private roads.
[02:03:30.300 --> 02:03:39.300]  And, you know, I had pets disappear, my cars, my tires, this last three of them was a, was a nail gun.
[02:03:39.300 --> 02:03:46.300]  I found somebody, you know, roaming around the outside of my house three o'clock in the morning, one morning.
[02:03:46.300 --> 02:03:54.300]  You know, they tried to, they, I, I was very careful about telling anybody what I was going to be out of town.
[02:03:54.300 --> 02:03:59.300]  And because I didn't want anybody to know until I got there.
[02:03:59.300 --> 02:04:05.300]  And I took my animals to the camel where I always take them.
[02:04:05.300 --> 02:04:11.300]  And I knew no sooner got to my destination than I got a phone call from her, the owner of the camel, who said,
[02:04:11.300 --> 02:04:18.300]  I just want to make sure before I do this, that it's okay, this woman called and said that you, you had, you had called her
[02:04:18.300 --> 02:04:26.300]  and asked her to please come get the animals from the camel that I rather that she, that they stay with her than, than the, at the camel.
[02:04:26.300 --> 02:04:29.300]  I, and I had, they had done no such thing.
[02:04:29.300 --> 02:04:38.300]  And the woman never showed up, but I mean, you know, they, they, they were following me.
[02:04:38.300 --> 02:04:40.300]  Oh no, I understand.
[02:04:40.300 --> 02:04:42.300]  They were following me.
[02:04:42.300 --> 02:04:43.300]  They knew my routine.
[02:04:43.300 --> 02:04:50.300]  And two days before my, my deposition, I mean, we, we just couldn't get out of it.
[02:04:50.300 --> 02:04:53.300]  I was out walking early one morning.
[02:04:53.300 --> 02:04:56.300]  I had a neck surgery.
[02:04:56.300 --> 02:04:59.300]  I got to go to break again, got to finish the story now.
[02:05:26.300 --> 02:05:30.300]  And they point out how forceful tones are the trademark of Bernie Sanders.
[02:05:30.300 --> 02:05:36.300]  And in the sharpest debate yet, Sanders went after Clinton for being a slave to Wall Street interests.
[02:05:36.300 --> 02:05:41.300]  To his credit, Sanders doesn't have a super pack raising huge sums from Wall Street like Clinton,
[02:05:41.300 --> 02:05:45.300]  but he was still able to raise 5 million more than his opponent in January.
[02:05:45.300 --> 02:05:51.300]  This should be a loud wake up call for the Clinton campaign who once considered the nomination a sure bet.
[02:05:51.300 --> 02:05:58.300]  Leigh Ann McAdoo reporting for infowars.com

[02:07:51.300 --> 02:08:16.300]  I'm Alex Jones for super male vitality and infowarslife.com and I salute you, our supporters.
[02:08:21.300 --> 02:08:36.300]  Alright, we've kept Kathleen Willey over a little bit because I was going into the Clintons in their background instead of just the abuse.
[02:08:36.300 --> 02:08:44.300]  But I realized something. I started getting nauseated listening to her and upset more so than I pretty much ever do.
[02:08:44.300 --> 02:08:54.300]  And I was having, I'm not being dramatic, flashbacks to being on the air during the 90s and the harassment that I got from the Clintons that I haven't even really gotten into.
[02:08:54.300 --> 02:09:02.300]  Fired, beaten up. I mean, it was shut up about Bill Clinton. Of course, they got beat up pretty bad too.
[02:09:02.300 --> 02:09:08.300]  But the point is, is that they're like evil. I feel oppressed by them.
[02:09:08.300 --> 02:09:16.300]  I told Matt Drudge at dinner that when I see a picture of Hillary Clinton, I physically, I'm just tired of them.
[02:09:16.300 --> 02:09:23.300]  It's like some jerk neighbor that like you move to get away from them and they move that, you know, next door to you again.
[02:09:23.300 --> 02:09:31.300]  That's just a jerk neighbor or some, you know, cousin you don't like and then you go to a family reunion and they come sit right by you and that's irritating.
[02:09:31.300 --> 02:09:35.300]  It's like 10 times that.
[02:09:35.300 --> 02:09:44.300]  You know, I'll make a lot more money probably if Hillary gets in with talk radio and the market will grow in libertarian conservative talk.
[02:09:44.300 --> 02:09:48.300]  I don't want that. I just want my country back.
[02:09:48.300 --> 02:09:55.300]  And I'm not being dramatic here. I was talking about being traumatized by the Clintons.
[02:09:55.300 --> 02:10:02.300]  When they called me into the radio station where I was number one at night in the slot and they said, you stop talking about Bill Clinton and you're fired.
[02:10:02.300 --> 02:10:09.300]  They had a new manager and I said, has this come down from the owners and he goes, oh, yeah, we've been contacted all the way up in Pennsylvania.
[02:10:09.300 --> 02:10:14.300]  This is in Austin, Texas. The owners have been contacted and they've never had this happen before.
[02:10:14.300 --> 02:10:20.300]  And by the way, they're big Democrats. You're going to shut your mouth or you're going to be off the radio.
[02:10:20.300 --> 02:10:25.300]  This is my first radio job. I'd been there four years had taken my show to number one.
[02:10:25.300 --> 02:10:29.300]  I was already syndicated. I was doing that out of my house.
[02:10:29.300 --> 02:10:34.300]  And I didn't really argue. I said, well, I'll try to, you know, but I can't, I can't stop telling the truth.
[02:10:34.300 --> 02:10:39.300]  And a few weeks later, they fired me and the guy laughed and said, your career's over. You're a loser.
[02:10:39.300 --> 02:10:45.300]  I tried to start a fight with me and I was like, whatever dude, I went home, you know, talked to like people on 30 something stations.
[02:10:45.300 --> 02:10:48.300]  And now it's almost 200, but I'm not going to swear about myself.
[02:10:48.300 --> 02:10:52.300]  I wanted to finish up and go to John Rappaport, but I don't know what it is about the Clintons.
[02:10:52.300 --> 02:10:55.300]  It's starting to happen with Obama, but not as bad.
[02:10:55.300 --> 02:11:02.300]  It's just been like eight years since he ran and stuff. I physically can't look at Newt Gennrich anymore.
[02:11:02.300 --> 02:11:12.300]  I'm not even trying to whine. I'm a pretty tough guy, but it's the, it's the evilness of them and the being forced to study them and being forced in other lies.
[02:11:12.300 --> 02:11:21.300]  And then she starts reminding me how our kids got threatened and them trying to kill her animals and all the folks they've killed and all the CIA guys I've had on about them and all the bad things they've done.
[02:11:21.300 --> 02:11:30.300]  And then the whistleblowers that have died and I just, I'm not even scared of them. I'm sick of them.
[02:11:30.300 --> 02:11:38.300]  You know, it's like my mom has had a lot of nice cats, but she had one when I was in high school that I was nothing but sweet to animals.
[02:11:38.300 --> 02:11:44.300]  It still didn't like me. It was this black Persian cat and it would urinate on my bed.
[02:11:44.300 --> 02:11:51.300]  And of course I washed my own clothes, made my own bed and, you know, I had friends over my room with some music.
[02:11:51.300 --> 02:11:58.300]  We sit down there and be cat pee on the bed. I got so sick of that cat and when it finally died, I didn't celebrate it, but I was like, thank God.
[02:11:58.300 --> 02:12:05.300]  I was already moved out by that. And my parents had actually moved back to Austin too, but I'm actually just being traumatized here and I'm not trying to be dramatic.
[02:12:05.300 --> 02:12:10.300]  I don't know the power that Clintons have over me and I asked God to heal me of this, but Kathleen, I'm not trying to be dramatic.
[02:12:10.300 --> 02:12:16.300]  You got, you know, physically attacked by him. You weren't going to go public. As you said, they threatened your kids, threatened your family,
[02:12:16.300 --> 02:12:21.300]  were in your backyard at three in the morning rural area. They tried to destroy you in business. I know you're losing your house right now.
[02:12:21.300 --> 02:12:23.300]  And I just want to say...
[02:12:23.300 --> 02:12:27.300]  Well, what I've just known has been kind enough to set up a GoFundMe page for me.
[02:12:27.300 --> 02:12:36.300]  You know, I have a terrible time asking for help, but I just find, you know, somebody finally sat me down and said, listen,
[02:12:36.300 --> 02:12:46.300]  there are a lot of people that want to help you. You have just got to let them do it. And because, I mean, I'm looking at a February 19th sale day of my house.
[02:12:46.300 --> 02:12:52.300]  I know. And if people appreciate what you've done, they need to go to your, and I was about to do that, go to a scandaladay.com.
[02:12:52.300 --> 02:12:59.300]  There's links to your GoFundMe site, a scandaladay, Kathleen Willey, and they need to donate today.
[02:12:59.300 --> 02:13:06.300]  And we're trying to help whistleblowers like yourself and Edward Snow and others that have been obviously persecuted for doing the right thing.
[02:13:06.300 --> 02:13:12.300]  But you are a hero. Now, you heard me just do three or four minutes. I don't know why Hillary, especially more than Bill,
[02:13:12.300 --> 02:13:20.300]  I actually have a somatic response now of feeling sickened when I see them. Do you have that same feeling and then enclosing?
[02:13:20.300 --> 02:13:29.300]  I couldn't. I can't. When they had that debate, I can't look at her. I can't look at her anymore. I can't listen to that cackle of her.
[02:13:29.300 --> 02:13:39.300]  Every time I come out of her mouth, you know, it's a lie. I say what? I went to see 13 hours a couple of nights ago,
[02:13:39.300 --> 02:13:55.300]  and I met those three guys, Kanto and Pig, and I met and spoke with them. These are really humble, honorable men.
[02:13:55.300 --> 02:13:57.300]  Aren't they the opposite of Hillary?
[02:13:57.300 --> 02:13:58.300]  Well, yeah.
[02:13:58.300 --> 02:14:01.300]  Strong, tough, honorable, true, real.
[02:14:01.300 --> 02:14:12.300]  Absolutely. I've got an email back and forth with one of them, and after, I want to tell you, when I saw that movie,
[02:14:12.300 --> 02:14:20.300]  and I cried all the way home. I was so angry after seeing that movie, and it was very realistic.
[02:14:20.300 --> 02:14:22.300]  And I've seen those guys interviewed on TV.
[02:14:22.300 --> 02:14:26.300]  I want to say good job, Michael Bay. Oh yeah, they pointed out she lied, ordered to stand down.
[02:14:26.300 --> 02:14:31.300]  In closing, finish up with a threat on your kids. You said one morning you're outside, Kathleen. Finish that off.
[02:14:31.300 --> 02:14:39.300]  Yeah, and this person who I had met, everybody who lived out here, was coming my way, and he just looked like a jogger,
[02:14:39.300 --> 02:14:46.300]  and he stopped me, and he said, did you ever find your cat? Because he had just disappeared into the night,
[02:14:46.300 --> 02:14:50.300]  and he was an old guy and didn't go out much.
[02:14:50.300 --> 02:14:58.300]  And so I put signs up around the neighborhood, and he had a collar on, and he had his name tag on.
[02:14:58.300 --> 02:15:03.300]  And he asked me if I ever found my cat, and I just thought he was a neighbor, and I said, no.
[02:15:03.300 --> 02:15:08.300]  And I said, you know, every time I drive in the driveway, I hope he's sitting on a porch.
[02:15:08.300 --> 02:15:12.300]  And definitely, he said, yeah, that's both right. He was a nice cat.
[02:15:12.300 --> 02:15:17.300]  And I said, have you seen him? Do you have him?
[02:15:17.300 --> 02:15:21.300]  And he just looked at me again. He said, yeah, he was a really nice cat.
[02:15:21.300 --> 02:15:24.300]  And that's when I thought to myself, fun's up here.
[02:15:24.300 --> 02:15:29.300]  And I should ask him who he was. I said, who are you? What do you want?
[02:15:29.300 --> 02:15:35.300]  And then he asked me about my children by name.
[02:15:35.300 --> 02:15:39.300]  Right then, he did get his ass beat so bad. That's why I don't do that at my house.
[02:15:39.300 --> 02:15:43.300]  Boy, if the government comes around and does that, you're going to get your neck broken.
[02:15:43.300 --> 02:15:48.300]  I mean, that's my default. You come up in my yard and threaten my kids, you're going to get hurt bad.
[02:15:48.300 --> 02:15:51.300]  I said, mama bear.
[02:15:51.300 --> 02:15:54.300]  We know what the good news is. That's when you went public. That's when you went after them.
[02:15:54.300 --> 02:15:56.300]  That's when you organized all the women.
[02:15:56.300 --> 02:16:00.300]  So you're more of a man than almost all these men out here, lady.
[02:16:00.300 --> 02:16:06.300]  Well, you don't go around threatening other people's children. I'm sorry.
[02:16:06.300 --> 02:16:10.300]  You just don't. And it was so insidious.
[02:16:10.300 --> 02:16:13.300]  What did he say when he said that? I mean, what else did he say?
[02:16:13.300 --> 02:16:21.300]  He asked me by name. And then he said, now your son, he's still in college in this town.
[02:16:21.300 --> 02:16:23.300]  I'm not going to say his name.
[02:16:23.300 --> 02:16:24.300]  He was threatening you.
[02:16:24.300 --> 02:16:29.300]  And your daughter, she still lives in this other town.
[02:16:29.300 --> 02:16:32.300]  What do you look like? Do you look like government? Do you look like a assassin?
[02:16:32.300 --> 02:16:34.300]  Do you look like a scumbag?
[02:16:34.300 --> 02:16:41.300]  He just looked like he was indistinguishable. I think that's probably why he was the one.
[02:16:41.300 --> 02:16:48.300]  He had on dark sweats and a sweatshirt and a baseball hat. I mean, he didn't look all that threatened.
[02:16:48.300 --> 02:16:51.300]  I remember you telling me the story 15 years ago.
[02:16:51.300 --> 02:16:57.300]  I got physically nauseous. So how did it end for folks?
[02:16:57.300 --> 02:17:03.300]  Well, I mean, he just, I finally said, what do you want?
[02:17:03.300 --> 02:17:08.300]  And then he threatened two children of a good friend of mine, too.
[02:17:08.300 --> 02:17:11.300]  I finally said, what is it that you want from me?
[02:17:11.300 --> 02:17:18.300]  And he said, you're just not getting in the message, are you?
[02:17:18.300 --> 02:17:24.300]  And I'll be very honest with you, Alex.
[02:17:24.300 --> 02:17:31.300]  When they threatened my children's lives, I thought, you know what, I can't let that happen.
[02:17:31.300 --> 02:17:37.300]  I'm just going to have to lie under oath. I cannot, you know, I have to protect my children.
[02:17:37.300 --> 02:17:46.300]  And something just quit. You know, when we got to the point, you know, we went, we said, you know, we'll find a federal judge.
[02:17:46.300 --> 02:17:54.300]  And I had to finally start talking. I told, I told, you know, something told me, tell the story, tell the story.
[02:17:54.300 --> 02:17:59.300]  I know when the rubber met the road and happened so often with patriots and heroes is that first they're scared.
[02:17:59.300 --> 02:18:05.300]  But when it comes to it, they, you know what, I'm not going to be scared because that's when they'd probably come after you is if you hadn't told the truth.
[02:18:05.300 --> 02:18:12.300]  Kathleen, Willie, everybody needs to go and support you at a scandaladay.com. God bless you, ma'am.
[02:18:12.300 --> 02:18:14.300]  And we'll talk to you again very, very soon.
[02:18:14.300 --> 02:18:19.300]  I appreciate it so much. And thanks for putting that up.
[02:18:19.300 --> 02:18:25.300]  Everybody should buy your book or at least go donate to keep your house. God bless you.
[02:18:25.300 --> 02:18:32.300]  And folks, I don't have a lot of patriots on like her and try to support them. I'm going to try to get those Navy SEALs on as well from Benghazi.
[02:18:32.300 --> 02:18:34.300]  We're going to skip this network break. I'm not doing this anymore.
[02:18:34.300 --> 02:18:37.300]  Obviously this week and I'm cutting back on it, but I want to have more time.
[02:18:37.300 --> 02:18:43.300]  I appreciate him holding investigative journalists. No more fake news.com while I go through all that.
[02:18:43.300 --> 02:18:47.300]  But I realize now psychoanalyzing, but he's a smarter psychology guy than even I am.
[02:18:47.300 --> 02:18:50.300]  He just cuts right to it. I'm not being dramatic.
[02:18:50.300 --> 02:18:54.300]  I felt great. I was having a good show. I was covering a lot of important news.
[02:18:54.300 --> 02:18:58.300]  Like I was doing that. I started listening to Clintons and remembering all the other women in the stories.
[02:18:58.300 --> 02:19:02.300]  I probably interviewed 20 of them back in the nineties and I got beyond nauseous.
[02:19:02.300 --> 02:19:07.300]  It's like a sickness in the soul where it's evil that I have to focus on the Clintons.
[02:19:07.300 --> 02:19:11.300]  But so many people say, good, just give into it. Ignore it. Go enjoy your own life.
[02:19:11.300 --> 02:19:14.300]  No, they're going to run over to simply do that.
[02:19:14.300 --> 02:19:21.300]  But I don't know what it is about Hillary, but she, it's just focusing on her.
[02:19:21.300 --> 02:19:27.300]  Soros too. I don't even want to look at it. And there's only a few other people like this.
[02:19:27.300 --> 02:19:31.300]  But I can't look at them anymore.
[02:19:31.300 --> 02:19:38.300]  And sometimes I just catch them on the cover of a newspaper or on TV and I actually turn away like it's Medusa.
[02:19:38.300 --> 02:19:45.300]  And I'm not being dramatic. You're a really smart guy when it comes to being investigative journals, but psychology and a lot more.
[02:19:45.300 --> 02:19:51.300]  And I want to get into Zika and the world economy and everything with you, but covering the waterfront for the next 10 minutes with you, sir.
[02:19:51.300 --> 02:19:54.300]  Mr. Rappaport, you just heard me for the last 10 minutes.
[02:19:54.300 --> 02:19:58.300]  Talking about that, I almost had to stop talking in a minute.
[02:19:58.300 --> 02:20:08.300]  I mean, I couldn't even figure out what I was going to say trying to analyze some key, some answer to all of this is why is Hillary so evil?
[02:20:08.300 --> 02:20:11.300]  Or some of the people I know say they can't look at her.
[02:20:11.300 --> 02:20:14.300]  Even people that are Democrats now are turning against her.
[02:20:14.300 --> 02:20:21.300]  What is it about Hillary? I mean, is she now the archetype of an arrogant above the law witch or what is it?
[02:20:21.300 --> 02:20:27.300]  Well, I can only give you my reaction, Alex, and that is she could be the next president.
[02:20:27.300 --> 02:20:33.300]  That's it. I realize the great evil, another wave of evils coming. And I just think of her ruling me. That's it. That's it.
[02:20:33.300 --> 02:20:43.300]  Yeah. You know, I mean, if she were just, you know, running a candy store downtown and you could see right away when you look at her, hey, there's something really wrong here.
[02:20:43.300 --> 02:20:50.300]  You buy, you know, whatever it is, a couple bottles of water and you walk out, but she could be the next president.
[02:20:50.300 --> 02:20:56.300]  And then consider what's going to happen. And it just goes on and on and on and on.
[02:20:56.300 --> 02:21:02.300]  And the power keeps increasing. She gets closer to the top, closer to her ultimate goal.
[02:21:02.300 --> 02:21:08.300]  It's one lie after another after another. And you can see what's behind it.
[02:21:08.300 --> 02:21:13.300]  I mean, this is not going to be an easy presidency, believe me, if she wins.
[02:21:13.300 --> 02:21:25.300]  I mean, this is a catastrophe because she is counting on getting revenge on everybody. Everybody.
[02:21:25.300 --> 02:21:35.300]  Because she is the type of person who believes that everybody has to pay because nobody has been completely loyal to her all the way through.
[02:21:35.300 --> 02:21:38.300]  And she deserves, you know, unquestioning obedience.
[02:21:38.300 --> 02:21:44.300]  Oh, you know, there's going to be a persecution. Can you imagine her, the getting even that's going to happen when she gets in?
[02:21:44.300 --> 02:21:51.300]  That's it. I physically realize I'm in danger. I've already been jacked with by the Clintons when I had one one hundredth the power I have now.
[02:21:51.300 --> 02:21:56.300]  And I'm on their enemies list. And when they brought up info wars, Richard Reeves talked to her and they heard info wars.
[02:21:56.300 --> 02:22:03.300]  They all turned like vampires in high noon. I guess I just realized that I'm in danger. I think that's what it is.
[02:22:03.300 --> 02:22:13.300]  Yeah, I think so. You know, that's you see somebody at the top and you like take Merkel, for example.
[02:22:13.300 --> 02:22:18.300]  I mean, there she is. And what is she saying out front?
[02:22:18.300 --> 02:22:26.300]  She's saying as if she's kind of mystified by this whole, you know, migrant wave of invasion into Europe.
[02:22:26.300 --> 02:22:35.300]  It's almost, you know, that's the front that she's presenting. Why would anyone, you know, we need people, you know, population is dropping and so forth.
[02:22:35.300 --> 02:22:40.300]  And you hear one lie after another, thudding down onto the carpet.
[02:22:40.300 --> 02:22:46.300]  You know, she doesn't know Peter Sullivan, the head of the UN migrant program signed a deal with her five years ago to bring them all in,
[02:22:46.300 --> 02:22:51.300]  that they advertise, come here, everything's free, that they made a deal with Turkey as a conduit to bring them in.
[02:22:51.300 --> 02:22:56.300]  They know they're invaders into Syria, not even Syria. She doesn't know there's hundreds of rapes today.
[02:22:56.300 --> 02:23:02.300]  She doesn't know they ordered the police to cover it up. She doesn't know they're using it to bring in a civil emergency just like France.
[02:23:02.300 --> 02:23:09.300]  She doesn't know. She doesn't know. She doesn't know her parents were Stasi, communist dirtbags. These people are filth.
[02:23:09.300 --> 02:23:15.300]  They don't want prosperity, John. They want to mount our heads. They want to break us. They want to dominate the Renaissance.
[02:23:15.300 --> 02:23:22.300]  They want to kill the Enlightenment. These people are the opposite of the real Illuminati.
[02:23:22.300 --> 02:23:26.300]  They're the counterfeit Illuminati of Adam Weishaupt, come to bring darkness.
[02:23:26.300 --> 02:23:33.300]  Yep. And so you see that every time you look at her. You can see behind that front.
[02:23:33.300 --> 02:23:39.300]  You know, she's just a little old lady down at the corner who's, you know, sitting there selling newspapers.
[02:23:39.300 --> 02:23:47.300]  Only she's the head of Germany. And so you know that behind this little front is tremendous.
[02:23:47.300 --> 02:23:53.300]  You know, everything is a lie. Every single thing is a lie that comes up.
[02:23:53.300 --> 02:23:59.300]  Yeah. Exactly. It's the same with Hillary. It's the same with Bill. It's the same with all of them, you know?
[02:23:59.300 --> 02:24:08.300]  And then you think, well, how could this be? How could a human being exist in that atmosphere of doing nothing but lying all the time?
[02:24:08.300 --> 02:24:14.300]  If I did, if I do anything wrong, I'm racked with guilt. Even if I do it by accident. How do these people operate?
[02:24:14.300 --> 02:24:22.300]  So they get into that, you know, underwater universe where everything is corrupt and everything is evil.
[02:24:22.300 --> 02:24:28.300]  They want to be there. That's the thing that people aren't willing to accept. They want to be there.
[02:24:28.300 --> 02:24:33.300]  That's where, you know, they thrive. It's like a certain kind of an insect.
[02:24:33.300 --> 02:24:39.300]  You know, you've got to put that insect in a swamp and it's got to be warm and so on and so forth.
[02:24:39.300 --> 02:24:42.300]  And it's got to have a lot of, you know, junk there.
[02:24:42.300 --> 02:24:46.300]  It's their environment and they want to turn the world into their hell that they're comfortable in.
[02:24:46.300 --> 02:24:54.300]  Exactly. Exactly. Because when they look outside the swamp and they see there are people moving around, living their lives, you know,
[02:24:54.300 --> 02:25:02.300]  or reasonably satisfied or even very happy or whatever, they can't stand that because that's the reflection.
[02:25:02.300 --> 02:25:07.300]  Because our souls are bigger and stronger than theirs, but we don't seek the power so they see us as a rival and a threat.
[02:25:07.300 --> 02:25:11.300]  That's why they want to dominate us. That is the key to their entire system.
[02:25:11.300 --> 02:25:16.300]  When I say the good Illuminati versus the bad Illuminati, Illuminati just means enlightened, light, freedom.
[02:25:16.300 --> 02:25:21.300]  God's the light, folks. They're the false light, so they call it the Illuminati, but they're not bringing light.
[02:25:21.300 --> 02:25:27.300]  They're not bringing enlightenment. They created the Illuminati to take over the Renaissance that was the true enlightenment,
[02:25:27.300 --> 02:25:33.300]  that was the true power, that was the real original Christians before the establishment church.
[02:25:33.300 --> 02:25:39.300]  And that's what 1776 and all of it was, folks, and there's a battle between those two forces.
[02:25:39.300 --> 02:25:46.300]  The problem is, since they took it over after Washington's death, they've exterminated the original enlightenment leadership, folks.
[02:25:46.300 --> 02:25:49.300]  They're gone, but we have to take it back up against them.
[02:25:49.300 --> 02:25:52.300]  Rabbi Port, I'm sorry I'm ranting. This is just getting too heavy for me.
[02:25:52.300 --> 02:26:01.300]  Okay, okay. You know, when I was, I guess it was 19, I read Dostoyevsky's novel, The Idiot.
[02:26:01.300 --> 02:26:08.300]  That's a perfect image of what I'm talking about here, because here was just an innocent guy,
[02:26:08.300 --> 02:26:15.300]  and he fell into the complete corruption of Russian aristocracy at the time.
[02:26:15.300 --> 02:26:23.300]  And when those corrupt, terminally corrupt people looked at him, they saw a reflection of what they could never be,
[02:26:23.300 --> 02:26:31.300]  what they could never be, you know, because they were ensconced in evil and manipulation and so forth.
[02:26:31.300 --> 02:26:40.300]  And there was some little tiny piece of their soul that was still aware and awake that this character was, you know,
[02:26:40.300 --> 02:26:44.300]  a kind of a shining light that they could never have. They would never have.
[02:26:44.300 --> 02:26:51.300]  And so their only motivation after a certain point became destroy him, destroy him.
[02:26:51.300 --> 02:26:56.300]  So it's the same thing with these people. They look out at the world and they see something they can never have
[02:26:56.300 --> 02:27:02.300]  because they have entered into the swamp. That's where they live, underwater.
[02:27:02.300 --> 02:27:08.300]  That's where they want to live. That's where they're comfortable, but they can still see out enough to know
[02:27:08.300 --> 02:27:14.300]  that they can never have the one thing that they really would desire, so they have to kill it.
[02:27:14.300 --> 02:27:21.300]  It's the same allegory of Sleeping Beauty that these archetypes tell us the truth, where the witch demands the kids,
[02:27:21.300 --> 02:27:25.300]  they won't give them to her, they hide them, but then they sneak the kids back out, she gets happily married,
[02:27:25.300 --> 02:27:28.300]  and what she hates is the man and the woman, the family, loving each other, prosperity.
[02:27:28.300 --> 02:27:32.300]  She comes down off her big mountain as a dragon to try to kill everybody.
[02:27:32.300 --> 02:27:41.300]  Exactly. Kill the innocent. Kill the innocent because they represent what you can never have, the thing that you want.
[02:27:41.300 --> 02:27:47.300]  And that's what they're living with these people. So they have to keep on lying and lying and getting to greater level
[02:27:47.300 --> 02:27:55.300]  and committing crimes and getting to a greater level of power so that they can wreak their revenge and do more destruction.
[02:27:55.300 --> 02:27:56.300]  And that's where you go.
[02:27:56.300 --> 02:27:59.300]  And that's where it ends just on us not being in their universe.
[02:27:59.300 --> 02:28:04.300]  Exactly. That's all it is. You're not where I am, so I have to kill you.
[02:28:04.300 --> 02:28:10.300]  You know, if you say, when you put it that way, or when I put it that way, you see how completely insane it is,
[02:28:10.300 --> 02:28:13.300]  but that's the formula on which they're operating.
[02:28:13.300 --> 02:28:16.300]  What do you think of their minions? What's wrong with their minions?
[02:28:16.300 --> 02:28:22.300]  I mean, their minions are really evil on average. How do they follow such idiocy?
[02:28:22.300 --> 02:28:30.300]  Yeah. Well, they're completely deluded for one thing. You know, a lot of them are true believers,
[02:28:30.300 --> 02:28:38.300]  which means that they see in say, for example, Hillary, something that they aspire to,
[02:28:38.300 --> 02:28:41.300]  or they believe is good because they are true believers.
[02:28:41.300 --> 02:28:46.300]  And you see this in every age, every era in society, the history of the planet,
[02:28:46.300 --> 02:28:52.300]  some complete tyrant who has an enormous number of not just soldiers,
[02:28:52.300 --> 02:28:59.300]  but, you know, sycophants and admirers and so forth who don't see what's actually there.
[02:28:59.300 --> 02:29:06.300]  They see what they want to see. And then you have the weedling, corrupt, manipulating courtiers at court,
[02:29:06.300 --> 02:29:12.300]  you know, as in the old monarchies and so forth that are always maneuvering for a better position.
[02:29:12.300 --> 02:29:18.300]  That's where they want to live. They want to be in a situation where there is a single power at the top
[02:29:18.300 --> 02:29:25.300]  and that they can maneuver and manipulate and scheme and, you know, connive their way and see how high they can get.
[02:29:25.300 --> 02:29:29.300]  Stay there. Incredible. Absolutely. On target, John Rappaport, the deep secrets here.
[02:29:29.300 --> 02:29:32.300]  This is how it really works, but it's not secrets at all. It's primophatia.
[02:29:32.300 --> 02:29:37.300]  It's a conquest economy, a crony economy, not an economy based on your literature, your art,
[02:29:37.300 --> 02:29:42.300]  what you built, what you grew, what you did, that your family's known for telling the truth,
[02:29:42.300 --> 02:29:48.300]  that you do what you say you're going to do. That's the chivalrous renaissance economy of innovation.
[02:29:48.300 --> 02:30:16.300]  On the March, the Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:16.300 --> 02:30:22.300]  On Tuesday, German forces arrested two men suspected of links to ISIS preparing an attack on the German capital.
[02:30:22.300 --> 02:30:28.300]  It was a tipster who led to the whereabouts of the Belgian who led the November 13 attacks on Paris.
[02:30:28.300 --> 02:30:34.300]  According to testimony from the woman, the Islamic State group commander told her he had entered France without documents
[02:30:34.300 --> 02:30:39.300]  among a group of 90 people, including other militants that had scattered around the Paris region.
[02:30:39.300 --> 02:30:45.300]  The woman said he had been planning additional attacks on a nursery school, a shopping mall, and a police station
[02:30:45.300 --> 02:30:52.300]  before she turned his location over to police. You can find more reports on infowars.com.

[02:32:02.300 --> 02:32:07.300]  After I saw such a huge positive change in my husband, I had to try it for myself.
[02:32:07.300 --> 02:32:08.300]  Talk about the effects.
[02:32:08.300 --> 02:32:15.300]  I feel great when I wake up in the morning. I have drive to go to the gym. I feel like I look better. I feel better. I feel sexier. I love it.

[02:33:17.300 --> 02:33:22.300]  Sometimes when you're too close to a problem, you don't see it. That's my only blind spot.
[02:33:22.300 --> 02:33:30.300]  And I was asking the crew during the break, you know, it sounds dramatic that I was having an anxiety attack. I don't really have those.
[02:33:30.300 --> 02:33:36.300]  Other than like, you know, you get a call from, you know, wherever you hear your kids been hurt or something, you have an anxiety attack for 30 seconds.
[02:33:36.300 --> 02:33:46.300]  It's more of like just a nausea, a frustration, a, you know, oh, the Clintons ruling over us, knowing that more evil is coming.
[02:33:46.300 --> 02:33:52.300]  And the crew was like, no, that makes more sense than a lot of stuff, you say. So if I'm glad folks get where I'm coming from, I'm not being dramatic.
[02:33:52.300 --> 02:34:05.300]  It's just, this is real for me. We're not up here trying to put a bad face on this to have fun. We're putting a real face on this to get people to wake up to stop it.
[02:34:05.300 --> 02:34:15.300]  Now, you guys have a channel open or something in there. I'm getting a buzzfeed. I think one of your intercoms is on.
[02:34:15.300 --> 02:34:26.300]  Just saying, you know, I can tell a channel's up. No big deal. It's just at a certain point to just calmly go along.
[02:34:26.300 --> 02:34:35.300]  Each day, you got it. Thanks to just calmly go along each day.
[02:34:35.300 --> 02:34:43.300]  Like I'm talking about the price of tomatoes or something, and I'm a farm report. Oh, look, the Chinese are buying the US mercantile stock exchange.
[02:34:43.300 --> 02:34:50.300]  Oh, look, world economies imploding top banks, a death spiral, sell everything you have. Oh, no big deal.
[02:34:50.300 --> 02:34:57.300]  Oh, look, the government knew they were shipping in actual ISIS into Europe. German intelligence. OK, German spy chief.
[02:34:57.300 --> 02:35:03.300]  ISIS is sending terrorists into Europe disguised as refugees. I mean, ISIS said that in February of last year, one year ago.
[02:35:03.300 --> 02:35:08.300]  It's actually one year ago, tomorrow, on the 6th. Just, you know, code 291.
[02:35:08.300 --> 02:35:13.300]  Swedish police cover up thousands of crimes involving refugees. It just goes on and on.
[02:35:13.300 --> 02:35:17.300]  Russia's simulated nuclear strike against Sweden. NATO admits.
[02:35:17.300 --> 02:35:21.300]  Army and Marine Corps chiefs. It's time for women to register for draft.
[02:35:21.300 --> 02:35:28.300]  I've got two daughters that fundamentally makes me in between wanting to throw up and punch somebody in the nose.
[02:35:28.300 --> 02:35:34.300]  And then I realized getting angry is normal. I am not on the trance. I am not brainwashed.
[02:35:34.300 --> 02:35:39.300]  I am sick of it. And I'm sick of the Clintons with all their crimes getting away with all of it.
[02:35:39.300 --> 02:35:45.300]  The fact that they're known criminals. I mean, if I was dealing with Obama in 15 years again,
[02:35:45.300 --> 02:35:50.300]  I'm facing the prospect of eight years of that. And the way things are moving now with Democrats admitting
[02:35:50.300 --> 02:35:56.300]  they're trying to pass martial law bills in Congress to make the president God.
[02:35:56.300 --> 02:36:02.300]  And the Republicans are behind it. I mean, what are they planning? What's so big I can feel?
[02:36:02.300 --> 02:36:10.300]  Not just intellectually or geopolitically see I'm right, but I can feel my gut going, no Alex, it's worse than you're saying.
[02:36:10.300 --> 02:36:16.300]  And I've never been like this. I rant and rave to release steam, but I'm telling you, John Rappaport,
[02:36:16.300 --> 02:36:20.300]  NoMoreFakeNews.com, author, great info to site folks. Check it out today.
[02:36:20.300 --> 02:36:27.300]  Piercing inside, as I said, you really do have it. Are you feeling the energy level rise, both positive and negative?
[02:36:27.300 --> 02:36:32.300]  But I mean, now I almost feel like something really evil is rising though in the midst of it.
[02:36:32.300 --> 02:36:38.300]  I've been feeling a lot of positive energy and seeing it, but now I feel like the gates of hell have been opened or something.
[02:36:38.300 --> 02:36:44.300]  I'm feeling a new energy enter the country in the world that is just really bad.
[02:36:44.300 --> 02:36:49.300]  I mean, it's bad. It's death, Rappaport. Are you seeing that?
[02:36:49.300 --> 02:36:57.300]  I'm getting a very weird feeling about the presidential season. Alex has sort of taken a different kind of a turn.
[02:36:57.300 --> 02:37:05.300]  I'm looking across the board at the possibilities and who's getting pushed to the front and who's getting pushed to the back.
[02:37:05.300 --> 02:37:12.300]  And I'm seeing, you know, there's Hillary. There she is.
[02:37:12.300 --> 02:37:16.300]  She's got 500 delegates, super delegates already locked up.
[02:37:16.300 --> 02:37:24.300]  These are the people that are not affected by the primaries that just walk into the nominating convention and cast a vote for her.
[02:37:24.300 --> 02:37:33.300]  And if that's the case, you know, here she comes and then whoever the Republicans put up, you know, who's it going to really be?
[02:37:33.300 --> 02:37:40.300]  When all is said and done and how easy is it going to be for her to just kind of roll over everybody with her?
[02:37:40.300 --> 02:37:43.300]  Hell, she'll just blow the airplane up. She doesn't care.
[02:37:43.300 --> 02:37:49.300]  And then she's president, you know, and then here comes the revenge, you know.
[02:37:49.300 --> 02:37:57.300]  So, yeah, I see the, I see the weird twisting that's happening in this presidential campaign.
[02:37:57.300 --> 02:38:01.300]  I see it over and over again and it's not a good thing.
[02:38:01.300 --> 02:38:03.300]  It's a really bad thing.
[02:38:03.300 --> 02:38:08.300]  You've been an investigative journalist for big papers, an investigative journalist for major TV magazines.
[02:38:08.300 --> 02:38:10.300]  You're an investigative journalist, first and foremost.
[02:38:10.300 --> 02:38:14.300]  In your 40 years, or correct me if I'm wrong, I think it's 40-something years as a journalist.
[02:38:14.300 --> 02:38:17.300]  Have you ever seen such a crazy climate?
[02:38:17.300 --> 02:38:20.300]  Oh, absolutely not. Are you kidding?
[02:38:20.300 --> 02:38:26.300]  No, no. It gets bigger and worse and stranger all the time.
[02:38:26.300 --> 02:38:33.300]  You know, the antidote to that is that so many people wake up that they just stop giving their informed consent.
[02:38:33.300 --> 02:38:41.300]  I mean, that's the ultimate antidote is that people see, okay, this is spinning completely out of control.
[02:38:41.300 --> 02:38:46.300]  This isn't even a good imitation of what the republic is supposed to be.
[02:38:46.300 --> 02:38:52.300]  You know, this is like a bad, bad, you know, horror movie on a small budget.
[02:38:52.300 --> 02:38:57.300]  I mean, they aren't even trying to make it seem real anymore.
[02:38:57.300 --> 02:38:59.300]  It's just right out in the open.
[02:38:59.300 --> 02:39:04.300]  And it's not like it's some group that just wants to skim money but still wants the country to do well.
[02:39:04.300 --> 02:39:07.300]  I'd fight that because it always leads to worse corruption like we see now.
[02:39:07.300 --> 02:39:10.300]  But this is like hardcore. Your kids are ours.
[02:39:10.300 --> 02:39:13.300]  We're taking your guns. We're bringing in ISIS.
[02:39:13.300 --> 02:39:16.300]  We're putting poison in your water. We're going to forcibly shoot you up.
[02:39:16.300 --> 02:39:19.300]  We're going to make you EGMO. We hate you.
[02:39:19.300 --> 02:39:22.300]  I mean, it's just so evil.
[02:39:22.300 --> 02:39:25.300]  Yeah, that's the theme. That's what it feels like.
[02:39:25.300 --> 02:39:28.300]  The gloves are off, okay?
[02:39:28.300 --> 02:39:35.300]  For a while, we were pretending that, you know, this is a really good thing that we're doing.
[02:39:35.300 --> 02:39:40.300]  And we still talk that talk, but really, it doesn't matter anymore.
[02:39:40.300 --> 02:39:46.300]  All that you need to know is you're going to put all of your loyalty in us
[02:39:46.300 --> 02:39:51.300]  because once we get there, you have no other choice.
[02:39:51.300 --> 02:39:53.300]  And then we know getting there is worse.
[02:39:53.300 --> 02:39:58.300]  Casual society shutting off our food, totally enslaving us.
[02:39:58.300 --> 02:40:00.300]  We're being taken into the dungeon.
[02:40:00.300 --> 02:40:03.300]  They told us they were taking us to a candy stand where we're a five-year-old kid
[02:40:03.300 --> 02:40:05.300]  and now they're putting chains on our arms.
[02:40:05.300 --> 02:40:10.300]  And now we realize, oh, really, we really are in a psychose dungeon.
[02:40:10.300 --> 02:40:18.300]  You know, once I was testifying in front of a subcommittee in Nevada about antidepressant drugs
[02:40:18.300 --> 02:40:22.300]  and violence in children because they had a school shooting out there,
[02:40:22.300 --> 02:40:24.300]  and I was sitting in the subcommittee room.
[02:40:24.300 --> 02:40:33.300]  This is a state legislature in Nevada about which I knew the representatives, right?
[02:40:33.300 --> 02:40:35.300]  You go back 10 seconds. Your Skype just warped.
[02:40:35.300 --> 02:40:37.300]  Repeat what you just said.
[02:40:37.300 --> 02:40:44.300]  So I'm sitting in this committee room looking at these representatives there at this legislative hearing,
[02:40:44.300 --> 02:40:48.300]  just trying to get a read and a feel for what's going on.
[02:40:48.300 --> 02:40:57.300]  And then all of a sudden a woman enters the room and I find out she is the attorney general of the state of Nevada.
[02:40:57.300 --> 02:41:02.300]  And all of a sudden, all these representatives are, you know,
[02:41:02.300 --> 02:41:09.300]  gathering around her like little creatures, you know, to get their little piece of goodwill
[02:41:09.300 --> 02:41:14.300]  or that she would smile at them or engage in conversation with them.
[02:41:14.300 --> 02:41:21.300]  And then she tells an anecdote about Bill Clinton coming to town and this and that, a higher power, you know,
[02:41:21.300 --> 02:41:24.300]  and everybody's laughing obsessively.
[02:41:24.300 --> 02:41:28.300]  You were watching minion sprites hopping around the goblin,
[02:41:28.300 --> 02:41:33.300]  and then the goblin told you of a dragon king.
[02:41:33.300 --> 02:41:36.300]  It's a hierarchical.
[02:41:36.300 --> 02:41:38.300]  They're minions.
[02:41:38.300 --> 02:41:41.300]  You see, that's it. That's it. That's the story.
[02:41:41.300 --> 02:41:47.300]  So that's how you can have this bureaucracy in Washington and other places,
[02:41:47.300 --> 02:41:52.300]  in all the state capitals, even in cities, whatever, you know,
[02:41:52.300 --> 02:41:56.300]  that are just gobbling up everything because that's what these people do.
[02:41:56.300 --> 02:42:00.300]  They just kind of hang around and they just kind of attach themselves
[02:42:00.300 --> 02:42:06.300]  like little leeches and barnacles and creatures to the next person up the line
[02:42:06.300 --> 02:42:09.300]  and they on and on and on all the way to the top.
[02:42:09.300 --> 02:42:13.300]  And the person who's at the top, and this was something that I realized too
[02:42:13.300 --> 02:42:20.300]  when I was sitting in that legislative room, the person at the top feels that.
[02:42:20.300 --> 02:42:25.300]  All the, you know, all the pyramid, yeah, all the way down.
[02:42:25.300 --> 02:42:28.300]  Like a Greek god doesn't exist unless they're worshiped.
[02:42:28.300 --> 02:42:32.300]  They're becoming a god in their own mind, in their own egomania.
[02:42:32.300 --> 02:42:35.300]  Exactly. They can feel all that.
[02:42:35.300 --> 02:42:38.300]  And it's not just an illusion.
[02:42:38.300 --> 02:42:42.300]  It's real because everybody's in that universe.
[02:42:42.300 --> 02:42:45.300]  Everybody's playing that. Everybody's doing that.
[02:42:45.300 --> 02:42:48.300]  So, you know, you look at the old French courts.
[02:42:48.300 --> 02:42:53.300]  I don't know where you have a couple hundred people that were vying for attention.
[02:42:53.300 --> 02:42:57.300]  I mean, now you've got a million people, more than a million,
[02:42:57.300 --> 02:43:02.300]  millions of people inside government bureaucracies that are just feeding
[02:43:02.300 --> 02:43:06.300]  this kind of vile energy all the way up the line to the top.
[02:43:06.300 --> 02:43:11.300]  And then you have the president steps out on a platform and looks down at all of this
[02:43:11.300 --> 02:43:15.300]  like some sort of, you know, god at the top of the pyramid looking down
[02:43:15.300 --> 02:43:19.300]  and says, this is my kingdom.
[02:43:19.300 --> 02:43:21.300]  This is my empire. This is what I've got.
[02:43:21.300 --> 02:43:26.300]  And all these people owe me and they must do what I say they will do.
[02:43:26.300 --> 02:43:31.300]  I mean, wow, that's an awesome amount of corruption.
[02:43:31.300 --> 02:43:33.300]  But none of them are producers.
[02:43:33.300 --> 02:43:38.300]  They have to go out then and find somebody as a vampire to siphon blood off
[02:43:38.300 --> 02:43:41.300]  to then go give it to their god and we don't have any blood left.
[02:43:41.300 --> 02:43:44.300]  So they bring in Bernie saying, chop everybody's heads off.
[02:43:44.300 --> 02:43:46.300]  That'll give us more blood.
[02:43:46.300 --> 02:43:50.300]  And then all these little spoiled minions that are the next generation of the system,
[02:43:50.300 --> 02:43:52.300]  they're going, yes, blood, blood.
[02:43:52.300 --> 02:43:54.300]  I mean, have you seen the interviews we've done and Mark Dice have done?
[02:43:54.300 --> 02:43:55.300]  We don't edit these.
[02:43:55.300 --> 02:43:57.300]  We will show every person we talk to.
[02:43:57.300 --> 02:43:58.300]  Yeah, I know.
[02:43:58.300 --> 02:44:03.300]  And they actually 9 out of 10 say, put gun owners in forced labor camps or kill them.
[02:44:03.300 --> 02:44:09.300]  They say, elect Karl Marx, they say the most vile evil you can imagine
[02:44:09.300 --> 02:44:11.300]  and they actually think they're good.
[02:44:11.300 --> 02:44:15.300]  But the weird paradox was used to a slayer that was in an army of, say,
[02:44:15.300 --> 02:44:19.300]  centurions going out to dominate and kill, had to fight men to at least take it.
[02:44:19.300 --> 02:44:24.300]  Now it's just little bots of Jell-O all just going around going,
[02:44:24.300 --> 02:44:27.300]  evil, evil, your blood is ours.
[02:44:27.300 --> 02:44:29.300]  And they don't even have any strength to take it.
[02:44:29.300 --> 02:44:33.300]  We all just roll over in a trance and give it to them.
[02:44:33.300 --> 02:44:34.300]  Yeah.
[02:44:34.300 --> 02:44:38.300]  So it's an army of slugs of ruling over us.
[02:44:38.300 --> 02:44:41.300]  And many of them are college slugs now.
[02:44:41.300 --> 02:44:45.300]  You know, and I was just talking to somebody about this.
[02:44:45.300 --> 02:44:50.300]  You will now get people, most of the people who get to the college level
[02:44:50.300 --> 02:44:54.300]  can't even be taught anymore because they weren't prepared enough.
[02:44:54.300 --> 02:44:55.300]  They weren't educated.
[02:44:55.300 --> 02:44:56.300]  Nobody bothered.
[02:44:56.300 --> 02:44:58.300]  Nobody really cared.
[02:44:58.300 --> 02:45:00.300]  And nobody put it to them.
[02:45:00.300 --> 02:45:02.300]  Look, you're here to learn this.
[02:45:02.300 --> 02:45:03.300]  You got to learn something.
[02:45:03.300 --> 02:45:04.300]  Understand?
[02:45:04.300 --> 02:45:05.300]  You know?
[02:45:05.300 --> 02:45:06.300]  So none of that happened.
[02:45:06.300 --> 02:45:10.300]  All they were taught were values and slogans and mottos
[02:45:10.300 --> 02:45:13.300]  and all kinds of cheap kind of idealism, ridiculous stuff.
[02:45:13.300 --> 02:45:15.300]  And then they arrive at colleges.
[02:45:15.300 --> 02:45:18.300]  Professors, even the good ones, take one look around
[02:45:18.300 --> 02:45:20.300]  and want to just run into the night.
[02:45:20.300 --> 02:45:22.300]  It's just intellectual tinfoil.
[02:45:22.300 --> 02:45:23.300]  It's like Mardi Gras beads.
[02:45:23.300 --> 02:45:24.300]  There's no value.
[02:45:24.300 --> 02:45:26.300]  And all they do is just throw up stuff.
[02:45:26.300 --> 02:45:28.300]  Martin Luther King's racist.
[02:45:28.300 --> 02:45:29.300]  Pull him down now.
[02:45:29.300 --> 02:45:30.300]  Have you heard about that?
[02:45:30.300 --> 02:45:31.300]  Yeah.
[02:45:31.300 --> 02:45:32.300]  I mean, it's just mindlessness.
[02:45:32.300 --> 02:45:33.300]  Sure.
[02:45:33.300 --> 02:45:34.300]  Sure.
[02:45:34.300 --> 02:45:36.300]  So, you know, what do you think these kids are going to do?
[02:45:36.300 --> 02:45:41.300]  They're just going to attach themselves to the latest piece of corruption.
[02:45:41.300 --> 02:45:45.300]  You know, and they're going to say, well, we want to be part of this.
[02:45:45.300 --> 02:45:48.300]  We want to be part of this because we don't have anything else.
[02:45:48.300 --> 02:45:52.300]  So this is the minion phenomenon in all of its glory.
[02:45:52.300 --> 02:45:55.300]  It stretches out into so many dimensions of society.
[02:45:55.300 --> 02:45:57.300]  This is the end of the individual.
[02:45:57.300 --> 02:45:58.300]  This is the end of free will.
[02:45:58.300 --> 02:46:03.300]  This is the rise of just stupid, dumb, drooling, mindless servants
[02:46:03.300 --> 02:46:06.300]  who won't even know they're being commanded headlong off cliffs
[02:46:06.300 --> 02:46:10.300]  by their gods, by their psycho gods.
[02:46:10.300 --> 02:46:14.300]  And even in the intellectual class, you go into these giant research labs
[02:46:14.300 --> 02:46:17.300]  like the National Institutes of Health or something.
[02:46:17.300 --> 02:46:19.300]  And what do you have?
[02:46:19.300 --> 02:46:23.300]  You have highly educated researchers who are doing the same thing.
[02:46:23.300 --> 02:46:26.300]  They're reaching out for the next little grant money.
[02:46:26.300 --> 02:46:28.300]  They're reaching out for the next little project,
[02:46:28.300 --> 02:46:30.300]  the next little promotion appointment status.
[02:46:30.300 --> 02:46:31.300]  And they're so selfish.
[02:46:31.300 --> 02:46:33.300]  They're planning an ex-vacation perfectly.
[02:46:33.300 --> 02:46:35.300]  And they hate all their underlings and kill them.
[02:46:35.300 --> 02:46:38.300]  They're all stupid and love to go before the dean and grovel.
[02:46:38.300 --> 02:46:41.300]  And, oh, can I meet Bill Gates when he comes to town?
[02:46:41.300 --> 02:46:43.300]  They're so empty.
[02:46:43.300 --> 02:46:44.300]  Right.
[02:46:44.300 --> 02:46:49.300]  And this is, I mean, we're talking about thousands and thousands of employees, right?
[02:46:49.300 --> 02:46:54.300]  And so you take NIH, you take for National Security Agency, the CIA,
[02:46:54.300 --> 02:46:59.300]  on the FDA, just keep multiplying IRS, and you've got the same thing.
[02:46:59.300 --> 02:47:04.300]  You know, what's, or the biggest media outlets, what's the word from the top?
[02:47:04.300 --> 02:47:06.300]  What are we supposed to do here?
[02:47:06.300 --> 02:47:08.300]  How am I supposed to behave?
[02:47:08.300 --> 02:47:10.300]  And how do I act and react?
[02:47:10.300 --> 02:47:14.300]  And how can I, you know, mince my way ahead a little bit and get a little bit more?
[02:47:14.300 --> 02:47:17.300]  And there's new downloads every week now of how you're supposed to behave
[02:47:17.300 --> 02:47:20.300]  as they change the language and how you're supposed to conform
[02:47:20.300 --> 02:47:23.300]  to prove you're a servant of Soran.
[02:47:23.300 --> 02:47:24.300]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:47:24.300 --> 02:47:28.300]  So you get the latest directive and, OK, this is what I'm supposed to do now.
[02:47:28.300 --> 02:47:29.300]  This is the word.
[02:47:29.300 --> 02:47:32.300]  Last week it was that, but now it's the opposite.
[02:47:32.300 --> 02:47:33.300]  Who cares?
[02:47:33.300 --> 02:47:35.300]  I mean, it's the double think of Orwell.
[02:47:35.300 --> 02:47:37.300]  And so this is what society is becoming.
[02:47:37.300 --> 02:47:39.300]  And so it all comes back to the individual,
[02:47:39.300 --> 02:47:43.300]  because if the individual can't stand up for himself and say, this is who I am,
[02:47:43.300 --> 02:47:47.300]  this is what I mean, this is what I say, this is what I believe,
[02:47:47.300 --> 02:47:51.300]  I can think, you know, I understand I have power,
[02:47:51.300 --> 02:47:56.300]  and this is the way it was supposed to be set up.
[02:47:56.300 --> 02:47:58.300]  But now it's all gone.
[02:47:58.300 --> 02:47:59.300]  But I'm not gone.
[02:47:59.300 --> 02:48:01.300]  I'm not going away.
[02:48:01.300 --> 02:48:03.300]  Nobody's going to push me out the door.
[02:48:03.300 --> 02:48:05.300]  It doesn't matter what people say.
[02:48:05.300 --> 02:48:09.300]  You know, now if enough people had that,
[02:48:09.300 --> 02:48:11.300]  then things would start to turn around,
[02:48:11.300 --> 02:48:16.300]  because then informed consent would be withdrawn in a thousand different ways,
[02:48:16.300 --> 02:48:19.300]  too many ways for them to stop it.
[02:48:19.300 --> 02:48:21.300]  But it all depends upon that,
[02:48:21.300 --> 02:48:26.300]  because they are aiming to completely destroy not only the individual,
[02:48:26.300 --> 02:48:28.300]  but the concept of the individual.
[02:48:28.300 --> 02:48:29.300]  Exactly.
[02:48:29.300 --> 02:48:32.300]  And people point at this and they say, it's screwing everything up.
[02:48:32.300 --> 02:48:34.300]  Why would they want to hurt the money-making folks?
[02:48:34.300 --> 02:48:36.300]  The globalists control the issuance of currency and credit.
[02:48:36.300 --> 02:48:40.300]  It's like Mao's override of China, healing 84 million people.
[02:48:40.300 --> 02:48:42.300]  It wasn't a failure.
[02:48:42.300 --> 02:48:46.300]  Data Rockefeller, when he died, when Mao died, wrote the New York Times article,
[02:48:46.300 --> 02:48:51.300]  praising him, saying it worked wonderfully and how Mao followed his program.
[02:48:51.300 --> 02:48:53.300]  So that's the issue.
[02:48:53.300 --> 02:48:54.300]  You can read that article.
[02:48:54.300 --> 02:48:55.300]  It's online.
[02:48:55.300 --> 02:48:57.300]  This is what they want.
[02:48:57.300 --> 02:49:00.300]  They want to end the old system, and the old system isn't perfect,
[02:49:00.300 --> 02:49:06.300]  but what they're bringing in is the most dishonorable, anti-human, anti-liberal.
[02:49:06.300 --> 02:49:09.300]  That's what makes me mad as John, is I love Thomas Jefferson.
[02:49:09.300 --> 02:49:10.300]  I'm a real liberal.
[02:49:10.300 --> 02:49:12.300]  I'm tolerant, live and let live.
[02:49:12.300 --> 02:49:15.300]  I really, you know, to a point, I'm a Christian.
[02:49:15.300 --> 02:49:17.300]  I'm somewhat conservative at the same time.
[02:49:17.300 --> 02:49:20.300]  I make some of my conservative audience mad because I am so libertarian.
[02:49:20.300 --> 02:49:21.300]  But that's just who I am.
[02:49:21.300 --> 02:49:23.300]  I'm fundamentally that way.
[02:49:23.300 --> 02:49:25.300]  I don't look down my nose like a Pharisee,
[02:49:25.300 --> 02:49:27.300]  because of what somebody does in their bedroom.
[02:49:27.300 --> 02:49:31.300]  But then the people that are in a bedroom that I'm not even attacking say,
[02:49:31.300 --> 02:49:35.300]  you have kids and you're a man and you got to give that up.
[02:49:35.300 --> 02:49:38.300]  They want to destroy who I am.
[02:49:38.300 --> 02:49:42.300]  And so that's what's so crazy, is that it's a weird cult claiming it's liberal,
[02:49:42.300 --> 02:49:46.300]  but liberal means you accept everybody, but you keep your identity.
[02:49:46.300 --> 02:49:50.300]  They say, no, we tell you what to accept and you give up your identity.
[02:49:50.300 --> 02:49:51.300]  Well, that's the Borg.
[02:49:51.300 --> 02:49:53.300]  That's not liberal.
[02:49:53.300 --> 02:49:54.300]  Exactly.
[02:49:54.300 --> 02:50:00.300]  You know, there are armies of sociologists out there that have infiltrated universities.
[02:50:00.300 --> 02:50:05.300]  And really their whole theme is the individual doesn't exist at all.
[02:50:05.300 --> 02:50:07.300]  That was always a hallucination.
[02:50:07.300 --> 02:50:09.300]  I mean, I'm serious about this.
[02:50:09.300 --> 02:50:10.300]  I've got a quote from a guy.
[02:50:10.300 --> 02:50:11.300]  No, they admit it.
[02:50:11.300 --> 02:50:13.300]  They say, get rid of that trick people.
[02:50:13.300 --> 02:50:14.300]  They have no will.
[02:50:14.300 --> 02:50:16.300]  Then your will is theirs.
[02:50:16.300 --> 02:50:20.300]  But let me tell you, those sociologists from the CIA, they got will.
[02:50:20.300 --> 02:50:21.300]  You bet.
[02:50:21.300 --> 02:50:26.300]  And then you find somebody, you know, who struggles their way,
[02:50:26.300 --> 02:50:29.300]  struggles their way, works their way, whatever they do.
[02:50:29.300 --> 02:50:32.300]  They appear to get to the top in some way.
[02:50:32.300 --> 02:50:37.300]  And then they turn around and they say, I don't want anybody else to get to the top.
[02:50:37.300 --> 02:50:41.300]  So however I got to the top, that's now off the table.
[02:50:41.300 --> 02:50:47.300]  What I want now is control of what everybody can do and can't do because I'm at the top.
[02:50:47.300 --> 02:50:49.300]  Let's come back and talk about that with John Rabaport.
[02:50:49.300 --> 02:50:50.300]  And then there's another paradigm.
[02:50:50.300 --> 02:50:53.300]  People are so programmed, you try to lift them up.
[02:50:53.300 --> 02:50:58.300]  They then think you must secretly need them and get angry at you.
[02:50:58.300 --> 02:51:02.300]  What would your life be like if you woke up each morning with new vitality,
[02:51:02.300 --> 02:51:04.300]  feeling better than you have in years,
[02:51:04.300 --> 02:51:07.300]  and you noticed a difference in your sleeping patterns, blood sugar levels,
[02:51:07.300 --> 02:51:09.300]  and had a sense of well-being overall?
[02:51:09.300 --> 02:51:12.300]  There's something that is changing thousands of people's lives.
[02:51:12.300 --> 02:51:13.300]  And you could be one of them.
[02:51:13.300 --> 02:51:15.300]  It's called heart and body extract.
[02:51:15.300 --> 02:51:18.300]  Sharon Harris, co-creator of heart and body extract,
[02:51:18.300 --> 02:51:21.300]  talks about the positive effects of heart and body extract.
[02:51:21.300 --> 02:51:24.300]  What happens with the formula heart and body extract
[02:51:24.300 --> 02:51:28.300]  is it's giving the body the necessary vitamins, minerals, amino acids,
[02:51:28.300 --> 02:51:31.300]  enzymes, and phytonutrients so the body will heal itself.
[02:51:31.300 --> 02:51:34.300]  And yes, the body does have the ability to balance blood pressure,
[02:51:34.300 --> 02:51:38.300]  balance cholesterol, clean and unclog the arteries.
[02:51:38.300 --> 02:51:41.300]  It can also work on balancing the circulation for diabetics.

[02:51:43.300 --> 02:51:46.300]  It simply needs some help so it has the tools to heal itself.

[02:51:58.300 --> 02:52:00.300]  Paid for by Bonner & Partners, an independent research firm.
[02:52:00.300 --> 02:52:04.300]  Fed up after years spent fighting big government in Washington, D.C.,
[02:52:04.300 --> 02:52:07.300]  a multi-millionaire businessman has spent the last 30 years
[02:52:07.300 --> 02:52:10.300]  tracking an obscure threat to America.
[02:52:10.300 --> 02:52:14.300]  Today he says it's about to reach a sudden and disturbing conclusion.
[02:52:14.300 --> 02:52:18.300]  If he's right, your way of life is about to change very suddenly.
[02:52:18.300 --> 02:52:21.300]  From where you shop, to the doctors you visit, to your retirement,
[02:52:21.300 --> 02:52:23.300]  and the family you want to protect.
[02:52:23.300 --> 02:52:27.300]  Now he's made predictions like this before, and he was right then too.
[02:52:27.300 --> 02:52:30.300]  A few years ago he warned that housing prices would collapse.
[02:52:30.300 --> 02:52:31.300]  They did.
[02:52:31.300 --> 02:52:34.300]  Before that, he warned that dot-com companies would crash.
[02:52:34.300 --> 02:52:35.300]  They did.
[02:52:35.300 --> 02:52:37.300]  Those who listened had a chance to save themselves.
[02:52:37.300 --> 02:52:40.300]  But this has nothing to do with the stock market.
[02:52:40.300 --> 02:52:42.300]  This will affect us all.
[02:52:42.300 --> 02:52:46.300]  For every video he's released online, details everything you need to know at
[02:52:46.300 --> 02:52:48.300]  dollardownfall.com.
[02:52:48.300 --> 02:52:50.300]  Now maybe you'll disagree with his conclusions,
[02:52:50.300 --> 02:52:54.300]  but first you need to watch this video and see the facts for yourself.
[02:52:54.300 --> 02:52:56.300]  Just go to dollardownfall.com.
[02:52:56.300 --> 02:53:13.300]  Average weight lost in a study was 8.3 pounds to 4.2 inches total in first month.

[02:53:53.300 --> 02:53:55.300]  Make the call.
[02:53:55.300 --> 02:54:06.300]  866-987-Thin.
[02:54:06.300 --> 02:54:07.300]  Poncho needs your prayers.
[02:54:07.300 --> 02:54:08.300]  It's true.
[02:54:08.300 --> 02:54:12.300]  Save a few for lucky two.
[02:54:12.300 --> 02:54:13.300]  All right.
[02:54:13.300 --> 02:54:16.300]  I'm going to go ahead and end at this segment and then throw it to Rob Do who's going to
[02:54:16.300 --> 02:54:24.300]  have good old Richard Reeves from New Hampshire and all that news coming up in the fourth
[02:54:24.300 --> 02:54:25.300]  hour.
[02:54:25.300 --> 02:54:30.300]  We do three hours Alex Jones an hour or one of our great researchers anchors here broadcasting
[02:54:30.300 --> 02:54:31.300]  worldwide.
[02:54:31.300 --> 02:54:35.300]  I'll be back this Sunday 4 to 6 p.m. Central Standard Time.
[02:54:35.300 --> 02:54:40.300]  But just briefly, I just have goodwill.
[02:54:40.300 --> 02:54:44.300]  I really like seeing people built up doing well.
[02:54:44.300 --> 02:54:46.300]  In fact, you can have anything you want.
[02:54:46.300 --> 02:54:49.300]  Just don't take it from me to quote the jungle.
[02:54:49.300 --> 02:54:53.300]  Well, if that's the jungle, I'll be throwing that in any day.
[02:54:53.300 --> 02:54:58.300]  But briefly, the system is suppressing our normal hormones, our normal actions, our normal
[02:54:58.300 --> 02:54:59.300]  behaviors.
[02:54:59.300 --> 02:55:04.300]  And with the proper nutrients, the proper vitamins, you cannot completely reverse everything
[02:55:04.300 --> 02:55:05.300]  that's happened.
[02:55:05.300 --> 02:55:08.300]  But you can certainly wake up in a different world than they'd like you to.
[02:55:08.300 --> 02:55:13.300]  Anthroplex is our latest for athletics, for weight, for energy, for libido.
[02:55:13.300 --> 02:55:17.300]  It's where you'll really, in my experience, notice it quickly within a day.
[02:55:17.300 --> 02:55:20.300]  Anthroplex is our newest product available at infowarslife.com.
[02:55:20.300 --> 02:55:23.300]  And regardless, it funds the operation.
[02:55:23.300 --> 02:55:25.300]  But if you'll try it, I don't steer people wrong.
[02:55:25.300 --> 02:55:28.300]  I don't report stuff that isn't true on purpose.
[02:55:28.300 --> 02:55:29.300]  Occasionally, we're wrong.
[02:55:29.300 --> 02:55:31.300]  But not about our products.
[02:55:31.300 --> 02:55:32.300]  It really is amazing.
[02:55:32.300 --> 02:55:34.300]  And it's made right here in the USA.
[02:55:34.300 --> 02:55:36.300]  And it's discounted with free shipping and 15% off.
[02:55:36.300 --> 02:55:41.300]  And you get it with SuperMailVitality or SuperFemalVitalityInForesLife.com.
[02:55:41.300 --> 02:55:45.300]  The water filters, the non-GMO seeds, the pro-liberty t-shirts, the books, the videos.
[02:55:45.300 --> 02:55:49.300]  It's all things we like, we use, we believe in.
[02:55:49.300 --> 02:55:51.300]  So we treat others as we like to be treated.
[02:55:51.300 --> 02:55:54.300]  And we appreciate all your support, your prayers, and more.
[02:55:54.300 --> 02:55:55.300]  The products are amazing.
[02:55:55.300 --> 02:56:00.300]  infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:56:00.300 --> 02:56:04.300]  And infowarshealth.com is the whole young Javity line by the products there
[02:56:04.300 --> 02:56:07.300]  that also supports the broadcast, infowarshealth.com.
[02:56:07.300 --> 02:56:12.300]  Now, going back to John Rappaport, who I appreciate joining us from NoMoreFakeNews.com.
[02:56:12.300 --> 02:56:14.300]  Be sure and bookmarks that as well, folks.
[02:56:14.300 --> 02:56:16.300]  And just because you're awake doesn't mean others are.
[02:56:16.300 --> 02:56:17.300]  Pass the stories on.
[02:56:17.300 --> 02:56:19.300]  I'm not lecturing, we just need everybody.
[02:56:19.300 --> 02:56:26.300]  When it comes down to it, more of it is the TV sickness, like space sickness with no gravity,
[02:56:26.300 --> 02:56:34.300]  not being on the ground, not being agrarial, you know, not being on the Earth.
[02:56:34.300 --> 02:56:36.300]  We are being separated from our humanity.
[02:56:36.300 --> 02:56:38.300]  And part of that's our own development, part of that's artificial.
[02:56:38.300 --> 02:56:40.300]  But everything you do is to do that.
[02:56:40.300 --> 02:56:46.300]  I think so much of it is that the artificiality allows people to believe the larger lies that are intensifying.
[02:56:46.300 --> 02:56:52.300]  What do you think the few secrets are in the four minutes we have left or three minutes to break free
[02:56:52.300 --> 02:56:57.300]  at the beginning, like a little chicken coming out of an egg with our egg tooth into a wider world?
[02:56:57.300 --> 02:57:00.300]  How do we come out of Plato's Cave?
[02:57:00.300 --> 02:57:04.300]  Person's got to ask himself, what do I believe?
[02:57:04.300 --> 02:57:06.300]  You know, what's my conviction?
[02:57:06.300 --> 02:57:13.300]  That word conviction doesn't have anything to do with prison, although that's the way it's used now.
[02:57:13.300 --> 02:57:18.300]  What's your convictions? What are the basic convictions that you have?
[02:57:18.300 --> 02:57:21.300]  And then what are you going to do about it?
[02:57:21.300 --> 02:57:28.300]  You know, if a person sets out on that road, they are going to arrive somewhere important.
[02:57:28.300 --> 02:57:29.300]  That's where the power's at.
[02:57:29.300 --> 02:57:31.300]  That's where it is, exactly.
[02:57:31.300 --> 02:57:35.300]  And if you don't shake the power and do it with a pure heart, you will get the power.
[02:57:35.300 --> 02:57:39.300]  Yeah, you'll get somebody else's power if you don't find your own.
[02:57:39.300 --> 02:57:42.300]  That's for sure. That's the way it works out.
[02:57:42.300 --> 02:57:45.300]  So to me, that's where it starts.
[02:57:45.300 --> 02:57:47.300]  You know, and I see some people do it.
[02:57:47.300 --> 02:57:49.300]  I see other people that don't.
[02:57:49.300 --> 02:57:53.300]  I see other people that, you know, they're always on a wobble course.
[02:57:53.300 --> 02:57:56.300]  They're always wobbling.
[02:57:56.300 --> 02:57:57.300]  What are my convictions?
[02:57:57.300 --> 02:57:59.300]  Well, I don't know. I'm not sure.
[02:57:59.300 --> 02:58:01.300]  I'm looking, you know, this looks good.
[02:58:01.300 --> 02:58:02.300]  That sounds good.
[02:58:02.300 --> 02:58:05.300]  I like to buy this, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
[02:58:05.300 --> 02:58:07.300]  But there's no core.
[02:58:07.300 --> 02:58:09.300]  There's no center there.
[02:58:09.300 --> 02:58:12.300]  You know, what are you alive for?
[02:58:12.300 --> 02:58:14.300]  It's what your convictions are.
[02:58:14.300 --> 02:58:16.300]  That's what you've got to find.
[02:58:16.300 --> 02:58:21.300]  You've got to decide that you are conscious and do have free will because that itself is a choice.
[02:58:21.300 --> 02:58:22.300]  Absolutely.
[02:58:22.300 --> 02:58:26.300]  And there's so many people now who are convinced that's not the case.
[02:58:26.300 --> 02:58:27.300]  So you bet.
[02:58:27.300 --> 02:58:30.300]  You better understand that you're free.
[02:58:30.300 --> 02:58:33.300]  Because if you don't think so, you're just giving it all away.
[02:58:33.300 --> 02:58:34.300]  That's right.
[02:58:34.300 --> 02:58:38.300]  I want to have you up for a full hour to talk about the myth that we don't have free will.
[02:58:38.300 --> 02:58:41.300]  The enemy I've talked to them that they know we have free will, how powerful humanity is,
[02:58:41.300 --> 02:58:43.300]  but they need us off the field.
[02:58:43.300 --> 02:58:45.300]  John Rapaport, God bless you, my friend.
[02:58:45.300 --> 02:58:46.300]  Have a great weekend.
[02:58:46.300 --> 02:58:47.300]  That's a great soul right there.
[02:58:47.300 --> 02:58:48.300]  We'll be back with the fourth hour.
[02:58:48.300 --> 02:58:53.300]  Over the years, there have been a lot of powerful advancements in the field of science and nutraceuticals.

[02:58:58.300 --> 02:59:02.300]  like Beyond Tangy Tangerine, plant-derived minerals, and much more.

[03:00:09.300 --> 03:00:15.300]  Welcome, welcome everyone to the fourth hour of Overdrive for the Alex Jones show.
[03:00:15.300 --> 03:00:16.300]  I'm your host Rob Dew.
[03:00:16.300 --> 03:00:19.300]  This is Friday, February 5th.
[03:00:19.300 --> 03:00:23.300]  If you've just joined us, Alex had an amazing show today.
[03:00:23.300 --> 03:00:25.300]  And the Sean Stone interview is very interesting.
[03:00:25.300 --> 03:00:28.300]  I ended with John Rappaport and Kathleen Willey.
[03:00:28.300 --> 03:00:32.300]  So if you did not check it out, check it out tonight on our YouTube channel, The Alex Jones Channel.
[03:00:32.300 --> 03:00:35.300]  We'll have the full show up there for you to watch and enjoy.
[03:00:35.300 --> 03:00:39.300]  Or if you're a Prison Planet TV member, you can jump on and check out the show that way.
[03:00:39.300 --> 03:00:41.300]  We do love our PrisonPlanet.tv members.
[03:00:41.300 --> 03:00:45.300]  They make everything that you see here possible and we do appreciate you.
[03:00:45.300 --> 03:00:48.300]  And you can share your username and password with up to 20 people.
[03:00:48.300 --> 03:00:50.300]  So I've got a ton of stuff to talk about.
[03:00:50.300 --> 03:00:52.300]  I'm going to have some vaccine news at the bottom of the hour.
[03:00:52.300 --> 03:00:53.300]  That's pretty amazing.
[03:00:53.300 --> 03:00:56.300]  The vaccines that they keep telling you to take don't seem to be working.
[03:00:56.300 --> 03:00:58.300]  Wow, what a surprise.
[03:00:58.300 --> 03:01:02.300]  And there, of course, they'll be saying you just need more of them.
[03:01:02.300 --> 03:01:07.300]  I'm going to be looking at people that are kicking out these vaccine mongers out of places like Hawaii,
[03:01:07.300 --> 03:01:10.300]  but then they're coming or springing up in places like Richmond.
[03:01:10.300 --> 03:01:15.300]  I'm also going to show you a video that, to me, proves that cops are not here to protect you.
[03:01:15.300 --> 03:01:17.300]  And it didn't happen in our country.
[03:01:17.300 --> 03:01:21.300]  And I'm just saying, you know, they used to have protection to serve on their cars and now they don't.
[03:01:21.300 --> 03:01:25.300]  And this is what happens when the poop really hits the fan.
[03:01:25.300 --> 03:01:31.300]  And also, I'm going to show you a debate excerpt from Dinesh D'Souza who debated Bill Ayers.
[03:01:31.300 --> 03:01:34.300]  And we're going to have Richard Reeves on the ground in New Hampshire.
[03:01:34.300 --> 03:01:39.300]  But first, let's go to John Bowne's report on what happened when Obama went to the Muslim temple.
[03:01:39.300 --> 03:01:40.300]  Here it is.
[03:01:40.300 --> 03:01:47.300]  We talked about how their children were asking, are we going to be forced out of the country?
[03:01:47.300 --> 03:01:51.300]  Or are we going to be rounded up?
[03:01:51.300 --> 03:01:56.300]  Yesterday, Obama stirred the pot of intolerance at a Baltimore mosque.
[03:01:56.300 --> 03:02:02.300]  The Obama administration would have us all believe his speech is a needed effort to assure Muslim Americans
[03:02:02.300 --> 03:02:07.300]  that they will not be subjected to bigotry while he shepherds in Syrian refugees
[03:02:07.300 --> 03:02:15.300]  into small American towns to fuel Sharia no-go areas akin to the rape and murder invasion being waged on Europe.
[03:02:15.300 --> 03:02:21.300]  There was an open display of the Koran and the word Allah placed behind the president 99 times.
[03:02:21.300 --> 03:02:29.300]  A stark contrast to Obama's speeches at Christian churches where, for example, at Georgetown University in 2012,
[03:02:29.300 --> 03:02:33.300]  the White House had the name of Christ covered up by request.
[03:02:33.300 --> 03:02:37.300]  The future must not belong to those who slander the prophet of Islam.
[03:02:37.300 --> 03:02:44.300]  But to be credible, those who condemn that slander must also condemn the hate we see in the images of Jesus Christ that are desecrated.
[03:02:44.300 --> 03:02:51.300]  Back in June of 2009, Obama gave a speech addressed to the Muslim world titled A New Beginning No Less.
[03:02:51.300 --> 03:02:58.300]  In the speech, Obama went on to avoid the word terrorism and announced the future plans to end sanctions with Iran.
[03:02:58.300 --> 03:03:05.300]  Two years later, Egypt was in chaos and the throes of a violent revolution waged by the Muslim Brotherhood
[03:03:05.300 --> 03:03:09.300]  accelerated by President Obama's ties to its members.
[03:03:09.300 --> 03:03:18.300]  The attacks of September 11, 2001, and the continued efforts of these extremists to engage in violence against civilians
[03:03:18.300 --> 03:03:28.300]  has led some in my country to view Islam as inevitably hostile not only to America and Western countries, but also to human rights.
[03:03:28.300 --> 03:03:35.300]  All this has bred more fear and more mistrust.
[03:03:35.300 --> 03:03:45.300]  So long as our relationship is defined by our differences, we will empower those who sow hatred rather than peace.
[03:03:45.300 --> 03:03:55.300]  As the Holy Quran tells us, be conscious of God and speak always the truth.
[03:03:55.300 --> 03:04:03.300]  American Muslims have been practicing their religion peacefully in the United States since the first mosque was built way back in 1929.
[03:04:03.300 --> 03:04:12.300]  Of course, Americans aren't wiping out Muslims, but in the Middle East, Muslims are wiping out Christians at a rate of 100,000 per year.
[03:04:12.300 --> 03:04:21.300]  Meanwhile, the U.S. Justice Department is clearing the way to toughen laws regarding material support to designated domestic terror groups.
[03:04:21.300 --> 03:04:26.300]  Currently, it is only illegal to provide material support to international terrorists.
[03:04:26.300 --> 03:04:36.300]  Obama's DOJ is essentially seeking to minimize the threat of armed citizens and militias who are simply protecting their communities from the coming Sharia onslaught
[03:04:36.300 --> 03:04:39.300]  by designating them as domestic terrorists.
[03:04:39.300 --> 03:04:47.300]  Globalist puppet President Obama is subtly terrorizing the citizens of the United States with a meek, anti-American...
[03:04:47.300 --> 03:04:52.300]  You can see the rest at the Alex Jones channel, and it was on last night, the Info Wars Nightly News, so join us there at 7 p.m. Central.

[03:05:25.300 --> 03:05:33.300]  The average 40-year-old man, if you look it up, in the West has half to a third of a testosterone that they're supposed to have.
[03:05:33.300 --> 03:05:39.300]  I'm always looking for ways to naturally get the body to start producing these hormones and balancing themselves.
[03:05:39.300 --> 03:05:43.300]  The counters and stuff they've been throwing at us, results will vary overall.
[03:05:43.300 --> 03:05:50.300]  All I know is dynamite. I mean, absolutely dynamite with stamina, with the weightlifting, with the swimming.

[03:06:37.300 --> 03:06:43.300]  They want to stun and dumb down, and energy drinks and stuff just cover that up for a while, but then burn you out.
[03:06:43.300 --> 03:06:49.300]  In my experience, whereas stuff that gets your glands naturally going goes right to the source, so it's pretty exciting, and I love it.

[03:08:23.300 --> 03:08:27.300]  Well, we have a team in New Hampshire right now, or actually almost in New Hampshire.
[03:08:27.300 --> 03:08:32.300]  They landed in Boston this morning. They're going to be driving up there. It's Richard Reeves and Matt Weber.
[03:08:32.300 --> 03:08:43.300]  Matt's a control room guy who works on the live show, and he also does step in to do field reporting, and he's become a very valuable member of the team.
[03:08:43.300 --> 03:08:53.300]  And right now, last night I texted those two guys, and I said, I want you to talk to everybody that you meet in New Hampshire and just ask them one question and get this on tape.
[03:08:53.300 --> 03:09:05.300]  Are they going to be voting for Marco Rubio? Because I am just astounded at how he came out of nowhere in Iowa to place third, because we know Microsoft was counting the votes, and that's his second biggest donor.
[03:09:05.300 --> 03:09:14.300]  And so I'm wondering if that will be the same in New Hampshire, because now, if you look at, let's see, here's the story out of the Boston Globe.
[03:09:14.300 --> 03:09:24.300]  New Globe poll shows Rubio closing in on Trump in New Hampshire. So this looks to be the wonder kind. They're going to force on us, Marco Rubio.
[03:09:24.300 --> 03:09:30.300]  And here's another interesting story out of the Miami New Times.
[03:09:30.300 --> 03:09:35.300]  Marco Rubio's childhood friend tied to Miami's most infamous gay porn case.
[03:09:35.300 --> 03:09:46.300]  And it talks about Marco got arrested back in a park that was well known to be like a, you know, sort of like a public brothel.
[03:09:46.300 --> 03:09:56.300]  And yeah, so Marco Rubio is a very, this guy can definitely be controlled, and that is why you see him rising in the polls.
[03:09:56.300 --> 03:09:59.300]  So without further ado, Richard Reeves, can you hear me?
[03:09:59.300 --> 03:10:04.300]  Yes, sir, Rob do. And what you're looking at right now is the steeple of the Old North Church.
[03:10:04.300 --> 03:10:13.300]  We are in fact right now, we just landed shortly a while ago in Boston, Massachusetts, and behind us at the backdrop is the North, the Old North Church.
[03:10:13.300 --> 03:10:23.300]  And just imagine the situation had Paul Revere not done his famous work that night of shining the lights and the steeple of the Old North Church and making his midnight ride,
[03:10:23.300 --> 03:10:29.300]  because potentially that's what we've got to read, you know, potentially we are shining the light.
[03:10:29.300 --> 03:10:35.300]  Alex Jones, Rob do the whole crew at Info Wars is shining the light of the New World Order red coat invasion.
[03:10:35.300 --> 03:10:39.300]  But with Rand Paul dropping out, which I know you want to talk about Marco Rubio.
[03:10:39.300 --> 03:10:47.300]  So we'll talk about Marco Rubio first, but Rand Paul's dropping out could be literally like Paul Revere not doing the ride that night.
[03:10:47.300 --> 03:11:02.300]  So with regards to Marco Rubio, the push for Marco Rubio, the way I figure it is you've got the anti-establishment vote adding up right now in Iowa, for example, it added up to 67%,
[03:11:02.300 --> 03:11:11.300]  which tells me that the potential out there for an establishment candidate to get consolidated votership would be roughly around 33%.
[03:11:11.300 --> 03:11:23.300]  So what I see are the powers that be doing their very best to get that full 33% of the establishment GOP, the old guard GOP people to rally around and push Marco Rubio.
[03:11:23.300 --> 03:11:30.300]  And I would like to remind you that in fact we did see in that caucus that we were actually the Matt and I did live on Skype.
[03:11:30.300 --> 03:11:39.300]  We saw in fact, if I remember correctly, it was 108 votes for Marco Rubio and 56 votes for Donald Trump in second place.
[03:11:39.300 --> 03:11:47.300]  So the Marco Rubio zombie bots, New World Order control, Fox News control bots, they are indeed out there.
[03:11:47.300 --> 03:11:48.300]  They are for real.
[03:11:48.300 --> 03:11:59.300]  As a matter of fact, right now when we pulled up to the Old North Church, there's a small tour bus here and it contained a load of Floridians up here to support on their way to New Hampshire for Marco Rubio.
[03:11:59.300 --> 03:12:07.300]  So there are 30 to 33% of the bots that potentially get consolidated for Marco Rubio and that is the case.
[03:12:07.300 --> 03:12:17.300]  And they're literally busing in supporters because I don't think they see the same support in New Hampshire that they're going to see in Florida for Rubio because that's where he's from.
[03:12:17.300 --> 03:12:18.300]  That's where he's a senator.
[03:12:18.300 --> 03:12:25.300]  And that's really scary that they're going to push, they know Jeb Bush doesn't have a chance, but they go, well, we got this other guy.
[03:12:25.300 --> 03:12:26.300]  He's our backup.
[03:12:26.300 --> 03:12:41.300]  And, you know, he's like a Mitt Romney, John McCain, as far as I'm concerned, just there to be a placeholder to do nothing to allow Hillary Clinton or last two elections, Barack Obama, just allow him to march right in.
[03:12:41.300 --> 03:12:48.300]  Well, Rob, the New World Order has as many backup plans as there are letters in the alphabet.
[03:12:48.300 --> 03:12:51.300]  They've got at least 26 backup plans.
[03:12:51.300 --> 03:12:56.300]  Marco Rubio is probably plan B or plan C already because we know Jeb Bush was at least on the Republican side.
[03:12:56.300 --> 03:13:01.300]  They're plan A. Marco Rubio is plan B or C that may or may not work.
[03:13:01.300 --> 03:13:05.300]  But then let me tell you the GOP still has a delegate strategy in the works.
[03:13:05.300 --> 03:13:07.300]  And let me kind of segue into the Rand Paul dropping out.
[03:13:07.300 --> 03:13:08.300]  Sure, go ahead.
[03:13:08.300 --> 03:13:10.300]  Let you know why this this is critical.
[03:13:10.300 --> 03:13:16.300]  It's I think it's a key mistake that Rand Paul has dropped out this pronto in the race.
[03:13:16.300 --> 03:13:21.300]  First of all, there's a big debate coming up tomorrow night.
[03:13:21.300 --> 03:13:31.300]  He would have had the probably the largest platform to put hit the bar wire on issues to put news out there to let people know what's going on out there against the New World Order.
[03:13:31.300 --> 03:13:33.300]  He could have been on there tomorrow night.
[03:13:33.300 --> 03:13:35.300]  He he blew that chance.
[03:13:35.300 --> 03:13:37.300]  He's not going to be on the stage tomorrow night.
[03:13:37.300 --> 03:13:48.300]  And even bigger in my book is that potentially with Rand Paul dropping out is that percentage that Rand Paul is getting.
[03:13:48.300 --> 03:14:04.300]  Those people are hot to go to precinct primaries, precinct conventions, precinct caucuses and potentially him dropping out really impacts the level of patriots that end up going to Cleveland in July.
[03:14:04.300 --> 03:14:12.300]  And we need to get the word out that everybody that's liberty and freedom minded constitutional minded just because Rand Paul is stepped out of the race.
[03:14:12.300 --> 03:14:21.300]  Do not back out by any means make sure and go out and vote make sure and be in your caucuses being your precinct conventions and get yourself to Cleveland.
[03:14:21.300 --> 03:14:34.300]  Because if not, what the GOP is counting on is they're counting on the old guard establishment GOP party hacks to show up at their conventions and caucuses and end up filling up Cleveland.
[03:14:34.300 --> 03:14:36.300]  And then they'll put in whoever they want.
[03:14:36.300 --> 03:14:40.300]  They'll put in Mitt Romney or whoever Marco Rubio they'll bring they'll try to in Jeb Bush.
[03:14:40.300 --> 03:14:43.300]  And so Rand Paul stepping out right now.
[03:14:43.300 --> 03:14:51.300]  I tell you, it's really frustrating because I don't think that Rand Paul gave out gave Alex Jones a five minute phone call in this decision making process.
[03:14:51.300 --> 03:15:01.300]  And that's irritating because we the info warriors Alex Jones, all the whole audience out there and everybody very supportive of the polls very supportive of what they've been doing.
[03:15:01.300 --> 03:15:02.300]  Right.
[03:15:02.300 --> 03:15:09.300]  In 2008, Ron Paul could win a house district in, you know, around Victoria, Texas on his own.
[03:15:09.300 --> 03:15:16.300]  But the 2008 campaign, Alex Jones, the info warriors, all the audiences out there listening to the broadcast today.
[03:15:16.300 --> 03:15:19.300]  It's you guys that we made it all together.
[03:15:19.300 --> 03:15:22.300]  We made the Ron Paul phenomenon happen in 2008.
[03:15:22.300 --> 03:15:28.300]  Even Hillary Clinton admitted she'd never seen so many vigorous support for any candidate ever.
[03:15:28.300 --> 03:15:30.300]  Then then she saw for Ron Paul.
[03:15:30.300 --> 03:15:32.300]  She admitted that in a congressional hearing.
[03:15:32.300 --> 03:15:33.300]  That's right.
[03:15:33.300 --> 03:15:44.300]  And that enthusiasm, that that diligence of the volunteerism, the working that they're willing to do the phone calls are willing to make the doors are willing to knock on the conventions.
[03:15:44.300 --> 03:15:45.300]  They're willing to attend.
[03:15:45.300 --> 03:15:52.300]  We if we lose that factor, then 20% of the Patriots that should be at Cleveland will probably not show up.
[03:15:52.300 --> 03:16:00.300]  And Rand Paul is not providing any direction to those people, the people on the ground, the folks on the ground that are voting in Iowa and all these different states.
[03:16:00.300 --> 03:16:14.300]  In 2012, it was Iowa that was one of the states that had a Ram Paul, a Ron Paul majority in 2012 at the, the RNC, the Republican National Convention down in Florida in 2012.
[03:16:14.300 --> 03:16:16.300]  Iowa was one of those states.
[03:16:16.300 --> 03:16:24.300]  It was because those people that went to those caucuses the night of the Iowa caucus back in 2012 followed through with the convention process.
[03:16:24.300 --> 03:16:33.300]  They went to their county convention, senatorial district state convention and they followed up through and they made it as a majority up to the RNC in 2012.
[03:16:33.300 --> 03:16:39.300]  And they, they were prepared to deliver a majority of their votes at the RNC for Ron Paul.
[03:16:39.300 --> 03:16:43.300]  And Paul beat Paul beats five other people that are still in the race.
[03:16:43.300 --> 03:16:46.300]  You know, they're literally, you know, finished fifth.
[03:16:46.300 --> 03:16:48.300]  Yeah, he had a respectable finish.
[03:16:48.300 --> 03:16:54.300]  He had a respectful fit and I understand the, the thinking that, oh, you know, I've got a hot race in my Senate seat.
[03:16:54.300 --> 03:16:55.300]  But you know what?
[03:16:55.300 --> 03:16:59.300]  He could have done himself a lot of good by being in this big national debate.
[03:16:59.300 --> 03:17:02.300]  Built a lot of capital because the New Hampshire, that's what everybody's looking at now.
[03:17:02.300 --> 03:17:03.300]  This is the first primary.
[03:17:03.300 --> 03:17:05.300]  This is what people are gearing for.
[03:17:05.300 --> 03:17:06.300]  And this is going to set the tone.
[03:17:06.300 --> 03:17:09.300]  Iowa, sometimes, you know, Rick Santorum won it last election.
[03:17:09.300 --> 03:17:13.300]  He's nowhere and he already dropped out, but he won it last time.
[03:17:13.300 --> 03:17:15.300]  He got 1% of the vote this time.
[03:17:15.300 --> 03:17:16.300]  Right.
[03:17:16.300 --> 03:17:18.300]  So we know he's not the anointed one.
[03:17:18.300 --> 03:17:21.300]  Unlike Marco Rubio, who we saw jump into third.
[03:17:21.300 --> 03:17:23.300]  And I think that's really troubling.
[03:17:23.300 --> 03:17:28.300]  I think he's going to be the new face of the Republican establishment and they're going to be pushing him.
[03:17:28.300 --> 03:17:36.300]  I think Trump's kind of an alienated himself from Fox News by not participating in that Fox News debate and really calling out.
[03:17:36.300 --> 03:17:37.300]  Right.
[03:17:37.300 --> 03:17:43.300]  As a matter of fact, I even talked about that the Saturday after we were in Dubuque, Iowa.
[03:17:43.300 --> 03:17:48.300]  The Saturday off after the Fox debate where Trump put on the veterans fundraising event.
[03:17:48.300 --> 03:17:54.300]  I talked about that how on Saturday, basically, Fox News had an ignore blackout on Donald Trump.
[03:17:54.300 --> 03:18:01.300]  They started focusing on strictly on a battle between Ruby on Cruz, Ruby on Cruz, Ruby on Cruz, Cruz, Rubio.
[03:18:01.300 --> 03:18:04.300]  And they were boosting Rubio up over and over.
[03:18:04.300 --> 03:18:06.300]  And then sure enough, that has continued that.
[03:18:06.300 --> 03:18:13.300]  Okay. Yeah, Fox is playing the angry bits of Trump's speeches, but he's not coming on live like he was.
[03:18:13.300 --> 03:18:18.300]  They're not lavishing these interviews on them on them on him like they were.
[03:18:18.300 --> 03:18:20.300]  And so yeah, Fox is really ticked off.
[03:18:20.300 --> 03:18:24.300]  The battle between Trump and Fox is not over because Roger Ailes.
[03:18:24.300 --> 03:18:32.300]  As a matter of fact, you've, we probably heard, we probably had reports on info wars, but Rush Limbaugh came out here in the last two or three days.
[03:18:32.300 --> 03:18:34.300]  How he's liking Marco Rubio all of a sudden too.
[03:18:34.300 --> 03:18:37.300]  Of course, of course. He's going to be the annoying one.
[03:18:37.300 --> 03:18:40.300]  He's who they're going to push on us. He was plan B, plan C.
[03:18:40.300 --> 03:18:47.300]  Maybe they thought Christie could do it for a while, but you know, it's definitely, they're definitely shoving it in our face.
[03:18:47.300 --> 03:18:49.300]  And it's really disgusting. Hey, we come back from break.
[03:18:49.300 --> 03:18:51.300]  I want to play you a couple clips.
[03:18:51.300 --> 03:18:58.300]  Kid Daniels went and interviewed Lou Rockwell, you know, speaking of Rand Paul and libertarianism at the Mises Circle event that was in Houston, Texas on January 30th.
[03:18:58.300 --> 03:19:02.300]  He has two clips, one about Marshall Law and one about Bernie Sanders.
[03:19:02.300 --> 03:19:05.300]  So I'd like to play those and get your comments on them.
[03:19:05.300 --> 03:19:07.300]  And I've also got some vaccine news.
[03:19:07.300 --> 03:19:16.300]  We've got Richard Reeves on the ground in Boston, right where Paul Revere lit the light and then made that famous midnight ride to go warn people that the British were coming.
[03:19:16.300 --> 03:19:28.300]  I actually was there in Lexington and Concord, watching one of the reenactments back in 2009 when Oathkeepers was there holding their, I guess it was one of their first big ceremonies that they were holding there.
[03:19:28.300 --> 03:19:35.300]  And they had to get special permission because the people of Lexington did not want to allow real patriots into their hallowed ground.
[03:19:35.300 --> 03:19:40.300]  They only wanted their controlled version of events, which is what we're going on with today.
[03:19:40.300 --> 03:19:44.300]  Same thing, looking at this Republican nomination process.
[03:19:44.300 --> 03:19:45.300]  So we'll be right back.
[03:19:45.300 --> 03:19:46.300]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[03:19:46.300 --> 03:19:47.300]  It's Overdrive.
[03:19:47.300 --> 03:19:48.300]  I'm Rob Dew, hosting.
[03:19:48.300 --> 03:19:49.300]  We've got Richard Reeves in Boston.
[03:19:49.300 --> 03:19:58.300]  We'll be right back.

[03:23:47.300 --> 03:23:49.300]  Say goodbye to the cable guy.
[03:23:49.300 --> 03:23:51.300]  Cut costs and get more.
[03:23:51.300 --> 03:23:54.300]  1-855-905-MY-TV.
[03:23:54.300 --> 03:24:06.300]  1-855-905-MY-TV.
[03:24:06.300 --> 03:24:08.300]  Now practically martial law.
[03:24:08.300 --> 03:24:12.300]  Well that's what they want and I've always thought that one of the things that happened after 9-11,
[03:24:12.300 --> 03:24:17.300]  I won't say it was entirely a military coup but it had aspects of a military coup.
[03:24:17.300 --> 03:24:25.300]  The military took on far more power than it ought to have and I would argue probably it should have any power
[03:24:25.300 --> 03:24:29.300]  but certainly it was massively increased, very, very unfortunately.
[03:24:29.300 --> 03:24:32.300]  So we know this is what they'd like.
[03:24:32.300 --> 03:24:37.300]  They'd like to if some, just like in Paris, if some city is giving them trouble,
[03:24:37.300 --> 03:24:44.300]  you know, maybe not paying the property taxes in a future depression, send them the truth.
[03:24:44.300 --> 03:24:49.300]  Interesting point, I mean the IMF, World Bank, they could ask Obama to deploy troops
[03:24:49.300 --> 03:24:55.300]  to this terrible country that's behind on their debts, even though the debts are designed for them not to get out of.
[03:24:55.300 --> 03:24:59.300]  So you could literally have American troops maybe going in and occupying countries
[03:24:59.300 --> 03:25:03.300]  and taking their natural resources and assets to sell these so-called debts.
[03:25:03.300 --> 03:25:05.300]  Or confiscating our guns.
[03:25:05.300 --> 03:25:07.300]  There you go, that was Lou Rockwell.
[03:25:07.300 --> 03:25:11.300]  That's an excerpt from an interview that Kid Daniels is going to release tomorrow
[03:25:11.300 --> 03:25:14.300]  and we're going to play another clip on Bernie Sanders coming up.
[03:25:14.300 --> 03:25:19.300]  But talking about the world economy, we have cities saying world economy seems trapped in death spiral.
[03:25:19.300 --> 03:25:24.300]  That came out just three hours ago on MSNBC.
[03:25:24.300 --> 03:25:31.300]  And Richard, you're at the spot where a few years ago after the Boston Marathon bombing in Watertown,
[03:25:31.300 --> 03:25:35.300]  they went door to door, pulling people out of their homes at gunpoint.
[03:25:35.300 --> 03:25:41.300]  And the FBI claimed they didn't know who these guys were, yet they had interviewed the older boy, Tamerlin,
[03:25:41.300 --> 03:25:43.300]  and his mom a couple years before it.
[03:25:43.300 --> 03:25:46.300]  Yet they go on TV going, we don't know who these guys are, you need to help us.
[03:25:46.300 --> 03:25:51.300]  So you're kind of in the epicenter of the New World Order's martial law grip.
[03:25:51.300 --> 03:25:53.300]  I think that's where you're going to see it first.
[03:25:53.300 --> 03:25:55.300]  If anything breaks down, it's going to be in the Northeast.
[03:25:55.300 --> 03:25:59.300]  You've got Baltimore, you've got those cities like that, Chicago, definitely.
[03:25:59.300 --> 03:26:01.300]  So what do you think about that?
[03:26:01.300 --> 03:26:08.300]  Well, all these major cities in the Northeast, you've got the major bridges where they can just create total bottlenecks
[03:26:08.300 --> 03:26:10.300]  and checkpoints very easily.
[03:26:10.300 --> 03:26:11.300]  So yes, you're right.
[03:26:11.300 --> 03:26:20.300]  And the Boston Marathon bombing, that was a textbook New World Order run-through test case of bringing in martial law.
[03:26:20.300 --> 03:26:27.300]  So we saw some of that martial law happen here recently with that big blizzard that they had three or four weeks ago.
[03:26:27.300 --> 03:26:29.300]  Telling people to stay in their homes.
[03:26:29.300 --> 03:26:30.300]  Yeah.
[03:26:30.300 --> 03:26:37.300]  Chris Christie is acting like Napoleon, trying to up his presidential cred as a candidate.
[03:26:37.300 --> 03:26:40.300]  And so yes, that's just it.
[03:26:40.300 --> 03:26:43.300]  That's why 2016 election to me is so important.
[03:26:43.300 --> 03:26:50.300]  The way I see it is because as Larry Nichols just said yesterday, folks, make sure and listen to that archive of Larry Nichols yesterday with Alex.
[03:26:50.300 --> 03:26:57.300]  If you didn't hear it, is 2016 may be our last election where we've got even a chance of making a difference.
[03:26:57.300 --> 03:27:00.300]  Yeah, black box voting is a concern.
[03:27:00.300 --> 03:27:02.300]  You know, there's a lot of concerns along the way.
[03:27:02.300 --> 03:27:10.300]  But nonetheless, if we show up, you know, the reason that we're in the shape where we're in is because good men and good women have done nothing for so long.
[03:27:10.300 --> 03:27:15.300]  And if we just show up here in 2016, we've got a chance to reverse a lot of this and get our country back.
[03:27:15.300 --> 03:27:16.300]  I really believe that.
[03:27:16.300 --> 03:27:17.300]  I totally agree.
[03:27:17.300 --> 03:27:22.300]  And we got that's what we have you on the ground to point out anything that may look fudgy or fuzzy.
[03:27:22.300 --> 03:27:27.300]  And I really want you to find some Marco Rubio supporters because I am amazed that any of them out there really exist.
[03:27:27.300 --> 03:27:38.300]  It was like, you know, for you know that we can get we can get in that that fortress down there in Austin and our central command center and start believing that, you know, that, you know,
[03:27:38.300 --> 03:27:41.300]  but it's just a situation that kind of sometimes people get in the bubble.
[03:27:41.300 --> 03:27:44.300]  The Marco Rubio people really are out there, but it's that old GOP.
[03:27:44.300 --> 03:27:46.300]  It's that old establishment guard.
[03:27:46.300 --> 03:27:48.300]  Like I said, well, it's like an established guard.
[03:27:48.300 --> 03:27:49.300]  I agree. I agree.
[03:27:49.300 --> 03:27:53.300]  It's like, but they don't put signs up. They're not they're not fervent fans.
[03:27:53.300 --> 03:27:56.300]  You know, when Ron Paul was out there, you saw Ron Paul signs everywhere.
[03:27:56.300 --> 03:27:59.300]  I never saw a John McCain sign or a Mitt Romney sign.
[03:27:59.300 --> 03:28:00.300]  You know, never.
[03:28:00.300 --> 03:28:08.300]  And it's just like, then they just come out of the little work on their walkers or Keynes or whatever, you know, they believe in the establishment because they've they've put all their money into it.
[03:28:08.300 --> 03:28:13.300]  So they they still want, they just think the government's going to give them that little bit of freedom left with their social security.
[03:28:13.300 --> 03:28:17.300]  So they want to keep the system as it is and not have any positive change.
[03:28:17.300 --> 03:28:20.300]  They just want to keep the fraction or reserve banking, the federal reserve.
[03:28:20.300 --> 03:28:26.300]  They want they want it all just to sit here so we live in perpetual debt.
[03:28:26.300 --> 03:28:33.300]  Well, the word, the top down word from GOP establishment, GOP establishment is telling the GOP minions, the establishment minions.
[03:28:33.300 --> 03:28:36.300]  Hey, Marco Rubio right now, that's what they're being told right now.
[03:28:36.300 --> 03:28:43.300]  They're being led that way in a, you know, different fashions, media and organizational at the county level, etc.
[03:28:43.300 --> 03:28:47.300]  So, yes, Marco Rubio, people really are out there.
[03:28:47.300 --> 03:28:54.300]  As a matter of fact, just this past Sunday, we went to an event in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, where he probably had about 500 people on a Sunday.
[03:28:54.300 --> 03:28:58.300]  But then the following Monday, the next day in the middle of the workday, Donald Trump had a thousand people.
[03:28:58.300 --> 03:29:00.300]  So yes, they're out there.
[03:29:00.300 --> 03:29:07.300]  I don't think Marco Rubio should be pulling anywhere near Donald Trump, but he has got the big media push and he's got the big money push.
[03:29:07.300 --> 03:29:13.300]  Because one thing you'll notice is that Marco Rubio, when he's giving a speech and he's speaking in public or whatever.
[03:29:13.300 --> 03:29:16.300]  I don't think I've ever heard him put out his website.
[03:29:16.300 --> 03:29:20.300]  I don't think I've ever heard him request, hey, donate a dollar, donate $20 or whatever.
[03:29:20.300 --> 03:29:25.300]  So that's kind of telling me that, hey, money's not an issue for Marco Rubio.
[03:29:25.300 --> 03:29:26.300]  Yeah, I believe it.
[03:29:26.300 --> 03:29:35.300]  And I think people are siphoning their super PAC funds over to him now that they see the writing on the wall that people aren't buying a third Bush presidency.
[03:29:35.300 --> 03:29:36.300]  Hey, Rob.
[03:29:36.300 --> 03:29:37.300]  Yeah.
[03:29:37.300 --> 03:29:38.300]  Rob, we are going to be signing off.
[03:29:38.300 --> 03:29:41.300]  We'll come back in when we get to New Hampshire later today.
[03:29:41.300 --> 03:29:42.300]  Sounds good.
[03:29:42.300 --> 03:29:43.300]  We'll get you on the nightly news.
[03:29:43.300 --> 03:29:44.300]  Thanks, Richard Greaves.
[03:29:44.300 --> 03:29:46.300]  Reporting live from Boston, I'm Rob Dew.
[03:29:46.300 --> 03:29:47.300]  We're going to be back here.
[03:29:47.300 --> 03:30:16.300]  We have some exciting vaccine news to stay tuned.
[03:30:16.300 --> 03:30:27.300]  We just look at the base problem that's going on right now all over the world, which is the endocrine disrupting chemicals, the amount of estrogen that men have, and what's going on even in children.
[03:30:27.300 --> 03:30:33.300]  The average 40-year-old man, if you look it up, in the West has half to a third of the testosterone that they're supposed to have.
[03:30:33.300 --> 03:30:39.300]  I'm always looking for ways to naturally get the body to start producing these hormones and balancing themselves.
[03:30:39.300 --> 03:30:41.300]  So it counters the stuff they've been throwing at us.
[03:30:41.300 --> 03:30:42.300]  Results will vary.
[03:30:42.300 --> 03:30:45.300]  Overall, all I know is dynamite.
[03:30:45.300 --> 03:30:50.300]  I mean, absolutely dynamite with stamina, with the weightlifting, with the swimming.
[03:30:50.300 --> 03:30:51.300]  Folks, the new product is available.

[03:33:33.300 --> 03:33:34.300]  Thanks for joining us.
[03:33:34.300 --> 03:33:40.300]  This is Rob Dew, sitting in as host of the Alex Jones Show Overdrive Hour.

[03:33:52.300 --> 03:33:56.300]  And Alex Jones is coming in right now with some big announcement.
[03:33:56.300 --> 03:33:58.300]  Well, no, it's just that...
[03:33:58.300 --> 03:34:00.300]  Oh my gosh, I didn't realize that.
[03:34:00.300 --> 03:34:06.300]  I was just sitting there on the couch doing research meeting with the Swedish bikini team and I'm joking.
[03:34:06.300 --> 03:34:10.300]  Seriously, I dropped the ball earlier, I don't mean to interrupt.
[03:34:10.300 --> 03:34:12.300]  I just wanted to ask if you've covered it yet.
[03:34:12.300 --> 03:34:14.300]  Ron Paul came out and there's video of it.
[03:34:14.300 --> 03:34:16.300]  It's on infowars.com.
[03:34:16.300 --> 03:34:18.300]  Oh, like an evangelist preacher, man.
[03:34:18.300 --> 03:34:20.300]  I didn't realize they had my hair like that.
[03:34:20.300 --> 03:34:23.300]  See, I was sitting on the couch having a meeting about stuff and sitting there playing with my hair.
[03:34:23.300 --> 03:34:25.300]  Anyways, getting back to what I was saying.
[03:34:25.300 --> 03:34:28.300]  This is spontaneous, he'll prompt her free as you can tell.
[03:34:28.300 --> 03:34:32.300]  Ron Paul, cruise on Libertarian, he's owned by Goldman Sachs.
[03:34:32.300 --> 03:34:35.300]  That's a big blow and that's good for Trump.
[03:34:35.300 --> 03:34:37.300]  So we need to get that article out, that's really important.
[03:34:37.300 --> 03:34:38.300]  Sorry, I just hadn't got that.
[03:34:38.300 --> 03:34:39.300]  Well, and here's the quote.
[03:34:39.300 --> 03:34:43.300]  I mean, he and Hillary have more in common than we would with Cruz and Trump.
[03:34:43.300 --> 03:34:45.300]  Yeah, he's still kind of hitting at Trump right there.
[03:34:45.300 --> 03:34:46.300]  Yeah.
[03:34:46.300 --> 03:34:48.300]  Ted Cruz is in a free market Libertarian.
[03:34:48.300 --> 03:34:52.300]  Ron Paul warned to his son's former supporters on Friday.
[03:34:52.300 --> 03:34:56.300]  Take a guy like Cruz, people are liking the Cruz, they think he's for the free market.
[03:34:56.300 --> 03:34:59.300]  And in reality, he's owned by Goldman Sachs.
[03:34:59.300 --> 03:35:01.300]  Well, his wife works for Goldman Sachs.
[03:35:01.300 --> 03:35:03.300]  I mean, that's the key right there.
[03:35:03.300 --> 03:35:06.300]  They did, they gave him some low interest loans.
[03:35:06.300 --> 03:35:09.300]  Ron Paul, I get Trump's not perfect.
[03:35:09.300 --> 03:35:11.300]  But here's the deal.
[03:35:11.300 --> 03:35:17.300]  The whole establishment is obviously against Trump for real.
[03:35:17.300 --> 03:35:19.300]  So, okay, fine, who are we going to support there?
[03:35:19.300 --> 03:35:21.300]  Marco Rubio, that's who they want to push on us.
[03:35:21.300 --> 03:35:23.300]  That's our savior.
[03:35:23.300 --> 03:35:26.300]  Thanks, Alex, for jumping in.
[03:35:26.300 --> 03:35:27.300]  Right.
[03:35:27.300 --> 03:35:28.300]  Oh, yeah.
[03:35:28.300 --> 03:35:29.300]  I forgot you're on the studio.
[03:35:29.300 --> 03:35:30.300]  Well, let me do an ad for you.
[03:35:30.300 --> 03:35:31.300]  Introducing Anthroplex.
[03:35:31.300 --> 03:35:33.300]  Twice daily pill formulation for men.
[03:35:33.300 --> 03:35:34.300]  Anthroplex.
[03:35:34.300 --> 03:35:37.300]  Hey, this is badass stuff.
[03:35:37.300 --> 03:35:40.300]  And if you don't use it, you're a Connie.
[03:35:40.300 --> 03:35:41.300]  There you go.
[03:35:41.300 --> 03:35:42.300]  It really is.
[03:35:42.300 --> 03:35:45.300]  I started using yesterday with the supermail vitality.
[03:35:45.300 --> 03:35:48.300]  I've noticed just a massive amounts of energy.
[03:35:48.300 --> 03:35:51.300]  It's got things like horny goatweed, zinc orate.
[03:35:51.300 --> 03:35:55.300]  So it's a powder form as a supermail is a liquid form.
[03:35:55.300 --> 03:35:57.300]  And I do play basketball in the winter.
[03:35:57.300 --> 03:36:02.300]  And I've always been taking my supermail and my vitamin B that B12 that we sell secret 12
[03:36:02.300 --> 03:36:05.300]  right before every game gives me lots of energy.
[03:36:05.300 --> 03:36:08.300]  So I'm waiting to see, I haven't had a game yet on the Anthroplex,
[03:36:08.300 --> 03:36:12.300]  but I'm waiting to see how it reacts as well because I'm getting up there.
[03:36:12.300 --> 03:36:14.300]  I'm 41, about to be 42.
[03:36:14.300 --> 03:36:18.300]  And I need all the help I can get sometimes running around the court
[03:36:18.300 --> 03:36:22.300]  with 26 year old guys who are complaining that they're tired.
[03:36:22.300 --> 03:36:24.300]  And I'm barely gasping for breath.
[03:36:24.300 --> 03:36:26.300]  So check out Anthroplex.
[03:36:26.300 --> 03:36:32.300]  It's brand new and you get 15% off when you get it with supermail vitality and free shipping.
[03:36:32.300 --> 03:36:36.300]  So order both today, Anthroplex and supermail vitality.
[03:36:36.300 --> 03:36:40.300]  Supermail is one of our most popular products and I take it every day.
[03:36:40.300 --> 03:36:42.300]  So check it out.
[03:36:42.300 --> 03:36:45.300]  Let's get to, guys, I'm going to switch things up on you.
[03:36:45.300 --> 03:36:50.300]  Let's get to this Fox News Latino story.
[03:36:50.300 --> 03:36:56.300]  And it's video watch six Mexican cops run from cartel hit men who execute man in front of his family.
[03:36:56.300 --> 03:37:04.300]  And I'm doing this to illustrate the fact that here in our country, we have an invasion of the cartel.
[03:37:04.300 --> 03:37:10.300]  They're coming in to the United States to deliver drugs, to take out hits on people.
[03:37:10.300 --> 03:37:11.300]  It's happening.
[03:37:11.300 --> 03:37:13.300]  It's happening on our southern border and our southern border is wide open.
[03:37:13.300 --> 03:37:20.300]  We've shown you the video of the guys bringing giant packages across the river paddling across.
[03:37:20.300 --> 03:37:23.300]  And I think we actually have a video that McBreen put in.
[03:37:23.300 --> 03:37:26.300]  So y'all could pull that video up because I do want to play it and I'll narrate over it.
[03:37:26.300 --> 03:37:32.300]  But we showed you the video of the guys throwing the drugs into the car and then running back over.
[03:37:32.300 --> 03:37:35.300]  I mean, it's just wide open and the border patrol was there right before that.
[03:37:35.300 --> 03:37:39.300]  And 10 minutes before the guys came across, they'd drive away.
[03:37:39.300 --> 03:37:40.300]  It's a game.
[03:37:40.300 --> 03:37:41.300]  It's a game.
[03:37:41.300 --> 03:37:45.300]  So if you get caught with these drugs, you're going into jail for a long time.
[03:37:45.300 --> 03:37:46.300]  You're going to be on parole.
[03:37:46.300 --> 03:37:50.300]  You're going to have your underwear sniffed nonstop by these people.
[03:37:50.300 --> 03:37:51.300]  So let's go to the video.
[03:37:51.300 --> 03:37:54.300]  I'll kind of narrate it for those watching on TV.
[03:37:54.300 --> 03:38:00.300]  It's a portrait cell phone cam, which, you know, please, if you're going to take video, just turn your camera sideways.
[03:38:00.300 --> 03:38:02.300]  It makes it makes it a lot easier for us video people.
[03:38:02.300 --> 03:38:04.300]  So let's roll that video.
[03:38:04.300 --> 03:38:06.300]  And there's the cops running.
[03:38:06.300 --> 03:38:11.300]  They have body armor and semi-automatic weapons that are running to their truck right now.
[03:38:11.300 --> 03:38:14.300]  And they're about to drive off.
[03:38:14.300 --> 03:38:16.300]  Look, there goes the trucks.
[03:38:16.300 --> 03:38:20.300]  And this lady's like, hey, what are you guys doing?
[03:38:20.300 --> 03:38:22.300]  You're leaving.
[03:38:22.300 --> 03:38:24.300]  And now it cuts to inside the house.
[03:38:24.300 --> 03:38:30.300]  You can see the cartelman grab this guy and they're dragging him outside.
[03:38:30.300 --> 03:38:33.300]  And you're going to hear the gunshots in a second.
[03:38:33.300 --> 03:38:37.300]  And this is just below our border. This is right south of us.
[03:38:37.300 --> 03:38:39.300]  This is happening.
[03:38:39.300 --> 03:38:42.300]  And there you go.
[03:38:42.300 --> 03:38:44.300]  The cartel went after this guy.
[03:38:44.300 --> 03:38:47.300]  He was a merchant.
[03:38:47.300 --> 03:38:54.300]  I mean, just four state police officers and two municipal town officers fled.
[03:38:54.300 --> 03:39:00.300]  And so the police are not going to protect you when it hits the fan.
[03:39:00.300 --> 03:39:04.300]  And so you have to protect yourself, which is why we have to have a second amendment.
[03:39:04.300 --> 03:39:07.300]  That illustrates right there why you have to have a second amendment
[03:39:07.300 --> 03:39:11.300]  and why you have to viciously protect it when people go after it.
[03:39:11.300 --> 03:39:13.300]  Viciously.
[03:39:13.300 --> 03:39:15.300]  And here's a video from Dinesh D'Souza.
[03:39:15.300 --> 03:39:17.300]  And I'm going to get to this vaccine news.
[03:39:17.300 --> 03:39:18.300]  We still got plenty of time left.
[03:39:18.300 --> 03:39:20.300]  Here's Dinesh D'Souza.
[03:39:20.300 --> 03:39:25.300]  He was at a, in the University of Michigan, debating Bill Ayers on the topic,
[03:39:25.300 --> 03:39:28.300]  What's So Exceptional About America.
[03:39:28.300 --> 03:39:32.300]  And it had 15,000 viewers online and 500 people there.
[03:39:32.300 --> 03:39:38.300]  And here they are talking about how Dinesh, you know, gives some money to a candidate.
[03:39:38.300 --> 03:39:41.300]  He gets eight months in prison, Bill Ayers bombs and Pentagon.
[03:39:41.300 --> 03:39:42.300]  Nothing happens.
[03:39:42.300 --> 03:39:44.300]  So here's that clip.
[03:39:44.300 --> 03:39:49.300]  So I think our criminal justice system is catastrophic and needs to be dramatically changed.
[03:39:49.300 --> 03:39:57.300]  One of the things I think is also catastrophic in it is that, is that the political system is something that's now for sale.
[03:39:57.300 --> 03:39:58.300]  It's on the auction block.
[03:39:58.300 --> 03:40:03.300]  And Dinesh referred to his time in custody.
[03:40:03.300 --> 03:40:04.300]  Were you in custody?
[03:40:04.300 --> 03:40:05.300]  I'm not sure.
[03:40:05.300 --> 03:40:06.300]  He had an assistant.
[03:40:06.300 --> 03:40:07.300]  Overnight custody.
[03:40:07.300 --> 03:40:11.300]  He had an assistant drop him off at his sleeping quarters overnight.
[03:40:11.300 --> 03:40:16.300]  I offered to write him a letter to the judge asking him not to put Dinesh in prison.
[03:40:16.300 --> 03:40:20.300]  He turned it down because I was going to advocate that he go to North Carolina and register voters,
[03:40:20.300 --> 03:40:26.300]  which would fit the crime of corrupting the political process in New York.
[03:40:26.300 --> 03:40:33.300]  But no, I think the criminal justice system is deeply corrupt and it's corrupted by politics.
[03:40:33.300 --> 03:40:38.300]  Okay.
[03:40:38.300 --> 03:40:44.300]  The inequity of our criminal justice system is on full display right on this podium right here.
[03:40:44.300 --> 03:40:49.300]  So I gave $20,000 of my own money over the campaign finance limit.
[03:40:49.300 --> 03:40:52.300]  I got eight years, eight months and overnight confinement.
[03:40:52.300 --> 03:40:54.300]  Eight months or eight years?
[03:40:54.300 --> 03:40:55.300]  Eight months.
[03:40:55.300 --> 03:40:56.300]  You said eight years.
[03:40:56.300 --> 03:41:05.300]  You bombed the Pentagon and tried to bomb all kinds of other things.
[03:41:05.300 --> 03:41:06.300]  What are you curious for?
[03:41:06.300 --> 03:41:11.300]  How much time did you do in the slammer?
[03:41:11.300 --> 03:41:13.300]  Yeah, he did nothing.
[03:41:13.300 --> 03:41:17.300]  So they're illustrating the inequities of the justice system.
[03:41:17.300 --> 03:41:20.300]  If you're in, if you're in the in crowd, you can do whatever you want.
[03:41:20.300 --> 03:41:21.300]  Like this guy, Squirelli.
[03:41:21.300 --> 03:41:22.300]  Martin Squirelli.
[03:41:22.300 --> 03:41:24.300]  There's some, I saw in the video.
[03:41:24.300 --> 03:41:25.300]  He was doing some testimony.
[03:41:25.300 --> 03:41:28.300]  Well, he actually, he went to his fifth amendment.
[03:41:28.300 --> 03:41:30.300]  He invoked it.
[03:41:30.300 --> 03:41:32.300]  And, you know, here's a guy who's not part of the system.
[03:41:32.300 --> 03:41:34.300]  And yeah, he's probably a jerk.
[03:41:34.300 --> 03:41:36.300]  You know, I don't know the guy.
[03:41:36.300 --> 03:41:43.300]  But here you got a guy who raised the price of this AIDS drug, you know, what he can legally do.
[03:41:43.300 --> 03:41:48.300]  But people are hammering him saying he's a, you know, gutless weasel, all this stuff.
[03:41:48.300 --> 03:41:54.300]  And then, and he also got the Wu-Tang, the only Wu-Tang album that's ever been printed of their new album.
[03:41:54.300 --> 03:42:01.300]  But anyway, beside the point, he gets thrown to the wolves and everybody's like, yeah, we got one, we got him.
[03:42:01.300 --> 03:42:02.300]  He's nothing.
[03:42:02.300 --> 03:42:03.300]  He's nothing.
[03:42:03.300 --> 03:42:10.300]  He's small time compared to what goes on with the vaccine industry, which brings me to my next set of topics.
[03:42:10.300 --> 03:42:12.300]  This is out of Quartz in India.
[03:42:12.300 --> 03:42:16.300]  An Indian biotech company has been developing Zika vaccines for over a year.
[03:42:16.300 --> 03:42:22.300]  Maybe they knew something we didn't know because this just started hitting the news a couple weeks ago.
[03:42:22.300 --> 03:42:27.300]  And one of the scientists says, we never expected the virus to become a serious issue.
[03:42:27.300 --> 03:42:32.300]  But now they've stepped up their plans to rush the vaccine to development.
[03:42:32.300 --> 03:42:37.300]  And this is, let's see, the name of the company.
[03:42:37.300 --> 03:42:40.300]  I don't have in front of me right now, but they're developing two versions.
[03:42:40.300 --> 03:42:42.300]  One uses DNA that belongs to the Zika virus.
[03:42:42.300 --> 03:42:45.300]  They're going to inject DNA of the virus into your body.
[03:42:45.300 --> 03:42:48.300]  And the other is an inactivated version of the virus.
[03:42:48.300 --> 03:42:55.300]  And they think that's going to be the most cost effective and the best one that's going to have the better chance of success.
[03:42:55.300 --> 03:42:58.300]  And vaccines are tough for pharmaceutical companies.
[03:42:58.300 --> 03:43:00.300]  Success rates are low and costs are high.
[03:43:00.300 --> 03:43:04.300]  They noted in this article, which I agree, success rates are low.
[03:43:04.300 --> 03:43:05.300]  These things don't really work.
[03:43:05.300 --> 03:43:14.300]  And what they're doing is injecting things like aluminum and mercury and polysorbate 80 into your body and telling you it's for your health.
[03:43:14.300 --> 03:43:16.300]  Now we go to a CNN article.
[03:43:16.300 --> 03:43:20.300]  Whooping cough protection fades fast after TDAP booster study finds.
[03:43:20.300 --> 03:43:22.300]  This does not provide long lasting protection.
[03:43:22.300 --> 03:43:27.300]  They found it protected about 69% of adolescents against whooping cough in the first year.
[03:43:27.300 --> 03:43:33.300]  But then it dropped to 57% in the second year, 25% in the third and 9% in the fourth year.
[03:43:33.300 --> 03:43:34.300]  So 91% ineffective.
[03:43:34.300 --> 03:43:37.300]  That's even worse than the flu shot.
[03:43:37.300 --> 03:43:39.300]  And now you're seeing this.
[03:43:39.300 --> 03:43:41.300]  Here's another article.
[03:43:41.300 --> 03:43:46.300]  Why are so many California kids getting whooping cough despite being vaccinated?
[03:43:46.300 --> 03:43:50.300]  And they say, but you know, most of these kids get it by the time they're six.
[03:43:50.300 --> 03:43:55.300]  So the population should have been fully inoculated, but they're getting 10 and 11 year olds are getting it.
[03:43:55.300 --> 03:43:56.300]  So that's four years later.
[03:43:56.300 --> 03:44:00.300]  You're seeing a 9% effectiveness right there.
[03:44:00.300 --> 03:44:06.300]  And they can't figure out what it is, why they can't figure out why this is the case.
[03:44:06.300 --> 03:44:13.300]  So their solution will be to give more kids vaccines and give them more of the booster.
[03:44:13.300 --> 03:44:15.300]  It's like, you're not getting enough of this garbage.
[03:44:15.300 --> 03:44:17.300]  So we're going to have to give you more.
[03:44:17.300 --> 03:44:24.300]  Now let's look at where's this other one from for the article from Hawaii.
[03:44:24.300 --> 03:44:33.300]  Yes, Hawaii lawmakers kill vaccine bill after heated debate after listening to residents speak out against vaccines and saying they cause everything from autism to the Zika virus.
[03:44:33.300 --> 03:44:38.300]  Hawaii lawmakers killed a bill to speed up the state's processing for adopting federal vaccination guidelines.
[03:44:38.300 --> 03:44:45.300]  The bill would have allowed the state health department to easily adopt the federal rules, which some opponents of the measure fear would result in more vaccination.
[03:44:45.300 --> 03:44:46.300]  Of course it is.
[03:44:46.300 --> 03:44:49.300]  They're going to find anything they can and inject it into your body.
[03:44:49.300 --> 03:44:53.300]  Now you have a bill HB 1342.
[03:44:53.300 --> 03:44:59.300]  This is out of the Richmond sunlight tracking Virginia's general assembly since 2007.
[03:44:59.300 --> 03:45:04.300]  This bill is immunization, immunization requirements related to an administration of vaccines.
[03:45:04.300 --> 03:45:17.300]  And basically when you go in and read the lawyer language here, they want to make every child at a public, private, middle, secondary, childcare center, nursery school, family daycare, home developmental center.
[03:45:17.300 --> 03:45:32.300]  She'll have to get the immunization schedule and be in strict with that in accordance with the schedule developed and published by the Centers for Disease Control, the advisory council, the immunization practices in the American Academy of Pediatrics.
[03:45:32.300 --> 03:45:44.300]  So, which includes the hepatitis vaccine, the diphtheria toxoid, the tetanus toxoid, which is in the D tap, which is in the diphtheria pertussis, which is whooping cough.
[03:45:44.300 --> 03:45:52.300]  So they want to inject that whooping cough vaccine into you, which they say is not even effective now after the fourth year of getting it.
[03:45:52.300 --> 03:45:54.300]  Just a freedom alert, the bill did fail.
[03:45:54.300 --> 03:45:55.300]  This bill did fail.
[03:45:55.300 --> 03:45:56.300]  Yes.
[03:45:56.300 --> 03:45:57.300]  Very good.
[03:45:57.300 --> 03:45:59.300]  And that came out in late January.
[03:45:59.300 --> 03:46:11.300]  So the fact that it did fail, and they had crossed out pieces in here to allow people to, even from a doctor, opt out of this licensing here.
[03:46:11.300 --> 03:46:15.300]  So they were going to make this as draconian as the California bill.
[03:46:15.300 --> 03:46:17.300]  So luckily it did fail, and that's good news.
[03:46:17.300 --> 03:46:18.300]  How did you, where did you find that?
[03:46:18.300 --> 03:46:19.300]  Did you just look it up?
[03:46:19.300 --> 03:46:20.300]  It's on the bill's website.
[03:46:20.300 --> 03:46:22.300]  It said the outcome was that it did fail.
[03:46:22.300 --> 03:46:23.300]  Oh, okay.
[03:46:23.300 --> 03:46:25.300]  But that's what they're trying to pull.
[03:46:25.300 --> 03:46:28.300]  They're trying to put these things in, and they're going to keep trying it.
[03:46:28.300 --> 03:46:32.300]  And unless people get up and stand up, I interviewed a lady last night.
[03:46:32.300 --> 03:46:34.300]  Her son, six years old, has autism.
[03:46:34.300 --> 03:46:35.300]  This is for the nightly news.
[03:46:35.300 --> 03:46:36.300]  We interviewed her for about five minutes.
[03:46:36.300 --> 03:46:38.300]  She's putting on an event in Dayton, Ohio.
[03:46:38.300 --> 03:46:42.300]  And I tell you, it was really sad.
[03:46:42.300 --> 03:46:45.300]  Her little boy jumped in on camera, cute little kid.
[03:46:45.300 --> 03:46:48.300]  But you can tell, like, he is severely damaged.
[03:46:48.300 --> 03:46:55.300]  And she says it was after he got the MMR vaccine, right after that developed autism and severely limited.
[03:46:55.300 --> 03:47:01.300]  And, man, it was just sad to see is when you see the real face of what these parents have to go through.
[03:47:01.300 --> 03:47:04.300]  I mean, being a parent is hard enough when you have kids that have all their faculties.
[03:47:04.300 --> 03:47:09.300]  Like, my 10-year-old makes his own lunch, cooks his own food, he's super independent.
[03:47:09.300 --> 03:47:11.300]  But it's so hard raising kids.
[03:47:11.300 --> 03:47:13.300]  Can you imagine kids that can't do any of that?
[03:47:13.300 --> 03:47:18.300]  And that's what we're bringing in a world of children that can't do anything for themselves.
[03:47:18.300 --> 03:47:19.300]  One, they're being trained that way.
[03:47:19.300 --> 03:47:23.300]  And two, they're being destroyed by these toxic vaccines.
[03:47:23.300 --> 03:47:28.300]  And you can just look at the, here's one of the DTAP vaccine inserts.
[03:47:28.300 --> 03:47:30.300]  I printed it out really big.
[03:47:30.300 --> 03:47:37.300]  And it talks about getting Guillain-Barre, having encephalitis, encephalopathy.
[03:47:37.300 --> 03:47:43.300]  And let's just go to the, oh, blood and lymphatic system disorders, cardiac disorders.
[03:47:43.300 --> 03:47:46.300]  All these postmarking events that happen after you get the vaccine,
[03:47:46.300 --> 03:47:50.300]  and that they're now going to tell you you have to get more of the T-DAP vaccine.
[03:47:50.300 --> 03:47:55.300]  And also has aluminum hydroxide as an adjuvant and polysorbate 80,
[03:47:55.300 --> 03:47:59.300]  both of which are known carcinogens.
[03:47:59.300 --> 03:48:02.300]  So there you go. That's what they want to do to your kids.
[03:48:02.300 --> 03:48:04.300]  They want to inject that into them.
[03:48:04.300 --> 03:48:09.300]  And just, it boggles my mind that that is the world we're coming into
[03:48:09.300 --> 03:48:11.300]  and that more people aren't standing up.
[03:48:11.300 --> 03:48:13.300]  So you need to have events in your area.
[03:48:13.300 --> 03:48:15.300]  You need to get involved.
[03:48:15.300 --> 03:48:18.300]  You need to speak out against what they're trying to do to our children
[03:48:18.300 --> 03:48:22.300]  because it is, it is a devastating, it's just devastating.
[03:48:22.300 --> 03:48:26.300]  I almost have no words to describe how I felt last night while I was interviewing this lady
[03:48:26.300 --> 03:48:30.300]  and just looking at the face of her son and just seeing that here's a kid
[03:48:30.300 --> 03:48:34.300]  who had so much potential and yet it was snuffed out because of a syringe,
[03:48:34.300 --> 03:48:38.300]  something this big, just snuffed out his potential.
[03:48:38.300 --> 03:48:40.300]  And it's really sad.
[03:48:40.300 --> 03:48:44.300]  And so that's all really I have to say about that.
[03:48:44.300 --> 03:48:47.300]  Educate yourself before you vaccinate and read the damn insert.
[03:48:47.300 --> 03:48:51.300]  Do we have time for the Bernie Sanders clip with Kit Daniels?
[03:48:51.300 --> 03:48:53.300]  Okay, let's go ahead and go to that.
[03:48:53.300 --> 03:48:56.300]  This is Lou Rockwell on Bernie Sanders.
[03:48:56.300 --> 03:48:58.300]  This should be interesting.
[03:48:58.300 --> 03:49:01.300]  I think a lot of people, they think governments serve to protect them,
[03:49:01.300 --> 03:49:05.300]  but reality is governments simply monopoly on the use of force in a given territory.
[03:49:05.300 --> 03:49:11.300]  So government, all it's there to do is to not only protect its monopoly, but to expand it.
[03:49:11.300 --> 03:49:16.300]  Well, you only have to look at, you know, every paper you have to sign dealing with the government,
[03:49:16.300 --> 03:49:17.300]  there's a threat.
[03:49:17.300 --> 03:49:21.300]  If you don't do what they want, they're going to come and get you
[03:49:21.300 --> 03:49:23.300]  and they have the power to jail you.
[03:49:23.300 --> 03:49:25.300]  IRS envelopes us and you...
[03:49:25.300 --> 03:49:28.300]  Well, on the parking ticket, they have the power to jail you.
[03:49:28.300 --> 03:49:31.300]  If you sufficiently resist, they have the power to kill you.
[03:49:31.300 --> 03:49:34.300]  I mean, this is not a nice organization.
[03:49:34.300 --> 03:49:39.300]  This is a deadly, I would argue, government is mankind's greatest earthly enemy.
[03:49:39.300 --> 03:49:43.300]  And the wars it does, the looting it does, the control,
[03:49:43.300 --> 03:49:46.300]  it makes us all much poorer than we would be otherwise.
[03:49:46.300 --> 03:49:52.300]  It hinders the market, hinders parents in their raising of their children,
[03:49:52.300 --> 03:49:56.300]  hinders community development, hinders businesses, churches.
[03:49:56.300 --> 03:50:01.300]  We really are a very bad bunch of people and we're supposed to think that they're superior to us.
[03:50:01.300 --> 03:50:04.300]  They're morally superior because they're concerned about, well, the public interest, the public good,
[03:50:04.300 --> 03:50:09.300]  where in our nasty little lives we're concerned about our private interest,
[03:50:09.300 --> 03:50:15.300]  because the government has its own interest, which is in power and growth, money, control,
[03:50:15.300 --> 03:50:20.300]  their interest, unlike the interest of the butcher, he'd like to sell you more meat.
[03:50:20.300 --> 03:50:22.300]  But you don't have to buy the meat.
[03:50:22.300 --> 03:50:25.300]  The government, you got to buy the meat and you don't get the meat.
[03:50:25.300 --> 03:50:29.300]  So it's a bad operation.
[03:50:29.300 --> 03:50:33.300]  So with all that said, what do you say to Bernie Sanders supporters that think that
[03:50:33.300 --> 03:50:37.300]  you just get Sanders in office and everything's going to be hunky-dory?
[03:50:37.300 --> 03:50:41.300]  Well, I'd say a lot of these people have very good instincts.
[03:50:41.300 --> 03:50:43.300]  They don't like the crony capitalism.
[03:50:43.300 --> 03:50:46.300]  They don't like the banks.
[03:50:46.300 --> 03:50:51.300]  They don't like Wall Street, big investment, not just all stocks and bonds,
[03:50:51.300 --> 03:50:54.300]  but big investment banks, Goldman Sachs.
[03:50:54.300 --> 03:50:55.300]  And that's what you're going to get.
[03:50:55.300 --> 03:50:57.300]  You're going to get more of that with Bernie Sanders and all the ring race
[03:50:57.300 --> 03:50:59.300]  that want to just save more government.
[03:50:59.300 --> 03:51:00.300]  We'll be right back.
[03:51:00.300 --> 03:51:01.300]  Are you sneezing, coughing, and aching?

[03:54:01.300 --> 03:54:08.300]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:54:08.300 --> 03:54:12.300]  So we covered this earlier when Alex popped in to talk about this article.
[03:54:12.300 --> 03:54:15.300]  Ron Paul Cruz, not a libertarian. He's owned by Goldman Sachs.
[03:54:15.300 --> 03:54:18.300]  And if you scroll down, we got video of him.
[03:54:18.300 --> 03:54:22.300]  Kid Daniels went out to the event at the Mises Institute in Houston,
[03:54:22.300 --> 03:54:26.300]  and there is the video, and you know, Kid Daniels working on a weekend.
[03:54:26.300 --> 03:54:28.300]  All right, there he is asking the question.
[03:54:28.300 --> 03:54:29.300]  He went to the event, asked a question.
[03:54:29.300 --> 03:54:31.300]  That's what you need to be doing out there.
[03:54:31.300 --> 03:54:34.300]  Bring your phone with you and record it and then put it up on YouTube
[03:54:34.300 --> 03:54:35.300]  and send us a link.
[03:54:35.300 --> 03:54:38.300]  And that's how the news works in citizen journalism.
[03:54:38.300 --> 03:54:41.300]  Right, Jakari Jackson, who was a member of the citizen journalism posse
[03:54:41.300 --> 03:54:42.300]  before he came here.
[03:54:42.300 --> 03:54:44.300]  Yeah, you just got to be ready.
[03:54:44.300 --> 03:54:46.300]  You know, you go out to these events and you never know
[03:54:46.300 --> 03:54:48.300]  if you'll have a chance to get a question.
[03:54:48.300 --> 03:54:51.300]  But if you do, you know, you have to be ready for it to take your camera,
[03:54:51.300 --> 03:54:53.300]  you take your phone, you take anything you can,
[03:54:53.300 --> 03:54:56.300]  so you can get this documented and present that out to the public.
[03:54:56.300 --> 03:54:58.300]  Like what Richard Reeves did to Hillary Clinton.
[03:54:58.300 --> 03:54:59.300]  Yeah.
[03:54:59.300 --> 03:55:02.300]  We got like, we have Hillary Clinton gold now floating around this office.
[03:55:02.300 --> 03:55:05.300]  Target of opportunity, you know, whether, excuse me, whether it's that
[03:55:05.300 --> 03:55:08.300]  or when David Knight talked to her at the book signing here in Austin.
[03:55:08.300 --> 03:55:10.300]  You just never know, so you have to be ready.
[03:55:10.300 --> 03:55:11.300]  Exactly, exactly.
[03:55:11.300 --> 03:55:13.300]  So what's coming up tonight on the Nightly News?
[03:55:13.300 --> 03:55:15.300]  Well, we will be talking about Hillary, you know,
[03:55:15.300 --> 03:55:20.300]  because when she says there's a massive white right-wing conspiracy against her,
[03:55:20.300 --> 03:55:21.300]  they take that as gospel.
[03:55:21.300 --> 03:55:25.300]  But if somebody in the GOP says maybe something was rotten with the votes,
[03:55:25.300 --> 03:55:27.300]  all they got is a sore loser.
[03:55:27.300 --> 03:55:28.300]  So...
[03:55:28.300 --> 03:55:29.300]  He's a conspiracy theorist.
[03:55:29.300 --> 03:55:32.300]  So we'll talk about how she's spending more on her GOP
[03:55:32.300 --> 03:55:36.300]  or she's outspending the GOP more than six of the candidates there.
[03:55:36.300 --> 03:55:41.300]  Also, we have the Code 291, the Swedish police covering up thousands of crimes
[03:55:41.300 --> 03:55:42.300]  involving the refugees.
[03:55:42.300 --> 03:55:44.300]  That's a Paul Joseph Watson article.
[03:55:44.300 --> 03:55:47.300]  Also, similar to what you were talking about with Kid Daniels article,
[03:55:47.300 --> 03:55:50.300]  Kurt Nimmel has an article, The Men Behind Ted Cruz,
[03:55:50.300 --> 03:55:53.300]  Neocons in a CIA propagandist.
[03:55:53.300 --> 03:55:57.300]  And also, we will re-ear the Sean Stone interview that Alex Jones did earlier today.
[03:55:57.300 --> 03:55:59.300]  That was a pretty weird interview.
[03:55:59.300 --> 03:56:03.300]  Let me tell you, Sean Stone is out there talking about teleportation
[03:56:03.300 --> 03:56:05.300]  and leap portals.
[03:56:05.300 --> 03:56:09.300]  And I couldn't believe half of it when I was watching it.
[03:56:09.300 --> 03:56:10.300]  Well, you'll get to see it again.
[03:56:10.300 --> 03:56:11.300]  Oh, my gosh.
[03:56:11.300 --> 03:56:13.300]  You guys have another chance to take a look at it.
[03:56:13.300 --> 03:56:15.300]  It was a really good interview, though.
[03:56:15.300 --> 03:56:17.300]  One of Alex's was asking questions, getting answers.
[03:56:17.300 --> 03:56:20.300]  I think it was one of those just bam, bam, bam, back and forths,
[03:56:20.300 --> 03:56:22.300]  which is a really good, really good interview.
[03:56:22.300 --> 03:56:24.300]  He also interviewed Kathleen Willey, which I thought was,
[03:56:24.300 --> 03:56:25.300]  she's a powerful woman.
[03:56:25.300 --> 03:56:28.300]  I never realized she's just really, she really stepped up and said,
[03:56:28.300 --> 03:56:30.300]  no, I'm not going to take it anymore.
[03:56:30.300 --> 03:56:32.300]  And I got mad as hell.
[03:56:32.300 --> 03:56:33.300]  And that's what we need you to do out there.
[03:56:33.300 --> 03:56:35.300]  Get mad as hell.
[03:56:35.300 --> 03:56:37.300]  Join us in our fight for liberty and freedom.
[03:56:37.300 --> 03:56:38.300]  That's what we're doing here.
[03:56:38.300 --> 03:56:42.300]  We're not here, we're here because we want to be,
[03:56:42.300 --> 03:56:44.300]  but we're here because we have to be too.
[03:56:44.300 --> 03:56:47.300]  We are going to lose this country and lose our way of life
[03:56:47.300 --> 03:56:50.300]  if we just let people like Bernie Sanders get in control
[03:56:50.300 --> 03:56:52.300]  because there ain't going to be no free college.
[03:56:52.300 --> 03:56:54.300]  Well, that's the thing people need to understand.
[03:56:54.300 --> 03:56:57.300]  It's not us, you know, me, Rob, do Alex Shillins against the world.
[03:56:57.300 --> 03:56:59.300]  It involves you at home as well.
[03:56:59.300 --> 03:57:01.300]  You can't expect us to do everything because people, you know,
[03:57:01.300 --> 03:57:02.300]  they send me stuff.
[03:57:02.300 --> 03:57:04.300]  I'm sure you get more than I do.
[03:57:04.300 --> 03:57:05.300]  Hey, come out to our city council.
[03:57:05.300 --> 03:57:07.300]  I'm like, bro, you go to your city council meeting with your phone,
[03:57:07.300 --> 03:57:08.300]  film it.
[03:57:08.300 --> 03:57:10.300]  And even if the mayor flips you off like they do here in Austin,
[03:57:10.300 --> 03:57:12.300]  put it up on YouTube.
[03:57:12.300 --> 03:57:14.300]  Let people see what's going on in your city council.
[03:57:14.300 --> 03:57:16.300]  Or if they say we're going to get your guns,
[03:57:16.300 --> 03:57:19.300]  as soon as we get this done, we get that on video.
[03:57:19.300 --> 03:57:23.300]  You know, you got to be out there and be ready with the camera
[03:57:23.300 --> 03:57:24.300]  ready to go.
[03:57:24.300 --> 03:57:25.300]  That's the only thing.
[03:57:25.300 --> 03:57:26.300]  And you can use their own words against them.
[03:57:26.300 --> 03:57:28.300]  You don't have to lie or twist it.
[03:57:28.300 --> 03:57:31.300]  Hey, this is the city council or the city councilman at the time
[03:57:31.300 --> 03:57:33.300]  in Austin, Texas saying, hey, you keep your,
[03:57:33.300 --> 03:57:36.300]  your sign down there saying stop the gunman because we're going
[03:57:36.300 --> 03:57:38.300]  to make the sign legitimate here in a second.
[03:57:38.300 --> 03:57:39.300]  Exactly.
[03:57:39.300 --> 03:57:41.300]  And, you know, so that's all I could say.
[03:57:41.300 --> 03:57:44.300]  You got to just really get off the couch,
[03:57:44.300 --> 03:57:47.300]  get off your butt, get active, have events.
[03:57:47.300 --> 03:57:51.300]  Even if it's three people showing up, three people can do a lot.
[03:57:51.300 --> 03:57:52.300]  Three people.
[03:57:52.300 --> 03:57:55.300]  I've seen three people, you know, just about move mountains.
[03:57:55.300 --> 03:57:56.300]  Yeah.
[03:57:56.300 --> 03:57:59.300]  If they work together, form a plan and just go out and do it.
[03:57:59.300 --> 03:58:00.300]  Don't wait for perfection.
[03:58:00.300 --> 03:58:01.300]  It's never going to be perfect.
[03:58:01.300 --> 03:58:02.300]  No.
[03:58:02.300 --> 03:58:04.300]  So stay tuned for the Info Wars Nightly News tonight.
[03:58:04.300 --> 03:58:06.300]  Jakari Jackson is going to be hosting 7 p.m. Central.
[03:58:06.300 --> 03:58:07.300]  I'm your host Rob Do.
[03:58:07.300 --> 03:58:09.300]  You've been watching the fourth hour of Overdrive
[03:58:09.300 --> 03:58:12.300]  of the Alex Jones show that comes on every day,
[03:58:12.300 --> 03:58:15.300]  Monday through Friday, 11 a.m. to 3 p.m.
[03:58:15.300 --> 03:58:18.300]  and then back on Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m. Central.
[03:58:18.300 --> 03:58:20.300]  And then we have the Nightly News at 7 p.m.
[03:58:20.300 --> 03:58:22.300]  and sometimes it goes from 7 to 10 30.
[03:58:22.300 --> 03:58:26.300]  Lately we've been doing a lot of those marathon broadcasts live,
[03:58:26.300 --> 03:58:29.300]  making fun of these idiots that want to control you.
[03:58:29.300 --> 03:58:30.300]  Control you.
[03:58:30.300 --> 03:58:31.300]  That's what they want.
[03:58:31.300 --> 03:58:32.300]  So get active and get awake.
[03:58:32.300 --> 03:58:33.300]  All right.
[03:58:33.300 --> 03:58:37.300]  See you next time.
