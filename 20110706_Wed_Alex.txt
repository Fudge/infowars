[00:00.000 --> 00:11.480]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.480 --> 00:19.040]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.040 --> 00:23.000]  Texas Alex Jones
[00:23.000 --> 00:30.600]  get ready for a extremely important three-hour transmission as we
[00:30.600 --> 00:34.960]  simulcast on the AM and FM dial XM serious global shortwave internet
[00:34.960 --> 00:40.200]  streams at info wars.com and live video streaming of the show at
[00:40.200 --> 00:44.760]  prisonplanet.tv and if you're watching on prisonplanet.tv you can see the
[00:44.760 --> 00:51.200]  front page of the drudge report right now let's stay in Iraq says President
[00:51.200 --> 00:56.440]  Obama and drudge has a flashback quote I intend to remove all US troops from
[00:56.440 --> 01:03.320]  Iraq by the end of 2011 and of course we have the same reports and flashbacks
[01:03.320 --> 01:09.400]  up at info wars.com and prisonplanet.com but drudge has that special
[01:09.400 --> 01:12.520]  way of laying it out so we like to show what's going on over there at drudge
[01:12.520 --> 01:16.920]  report.com we have a lot of important and informative guests coming up today I'll
[01:16.920 --> 01:19.720]  tell you about that coming up in the next segment get into much of the news
[01:19.720 --> 01:25.600]  news just gets heavier and crazier by the millisecond and I'm also going to
[01:25.600 --> 01:33.280]  break down the history just the basic history of Obama and all these wars
[01:33.280 --> 01:38.880]  coming up later in the hour but simply put you remember don't you critical
[01:38.880 --> 01:42.920]  thinking is now quote a conspiracy theory if you call the Libya war a war
[01:42.920 --> 01:47.160]  you're called a conspiracy theorist because they say it's not a war even
[01:47.160 --> 01:51.600]  the Pentagon's own lawyers say no it's a war president and he just laughs at them
[01:51.600 --> 01:55.320]  and says well the UN says it's not so it isn't and after all they control
[01:55.320 --> 01:59.200]  reality according to them and if we buy into it and go along with it I guess
[01:59.200 --> 02:04.040]  they do control reality I love to use the analogy of the historical parallel of
[02:04.040 --> 02:10.680]  the Aztecs it was mainline government policy that they sacrificed at dawn at
[02:10.680 --> 02:18.200]  noon and at dusk in every major city every day multiple individuals and on
[02:18.200 --> 02:22.880]  holidays hundreds and in some cases thousands tens of thousands were
[02:22.880 --> 02:27.640]  sacrificed and if you were to teleport beam yourself back to say a thousand
[02:27.640 --> 02:31.320]  years ago in the great valley there where Mexico City is today at the great
[02:31.320 --> 02:37.800]  pyramid Mexico City on say a solar lunar eclipse where tens of thousands were
[02:37.800 --> 02:41.640]  being sacrificed to the point of their society was almost completely
[02:41.640 --> 02:45.840]  collapsed when the conquistadors showed up a few hundred of them could whip
[02:45.840 --> 02:50.120]  hundreds of thousands of Aztecs because it was just a complete joke by them
[02:50.120 --> 02:53.640]  because they sacrificed their strongest their well that gets into a whole
[02:53.640 --> 02:59.720]  anthropology history lesson the the issue here is that if you were to
[02:59.720 --> 03:03.200]  teleport yourself back and if you could speak Mayan to those Aztecs they spoke
[03:03.200 --> 03:08.680]  Mayan because they were of course the Mayans were the proto culture of all
[03:08.680 --> 03:13.120]  those different groups in southern North America and Central America but I'm
[03:13.120 --> 03:17.120]  digressing if you were to teleport back and could speak Mayan to them and said
[03:17.120 --> 03:21.760]  look don't sacrifice your children don't engage in cannibalism that was the
[03:21.760 --> 03:25.360]  main meat source the priests made their money off selling the human flesh in the
[03:25.360 --> 03:31.720]  markets below the pyramids this is a bad thing they would laugh at you and no
[03:31.720 --> 03:36.920]  doubt drag you up the pyramid and cut your heart out especially if you were
[03:36.920 --> 03:43.000]  white the most prized sacrifice of the Aztecs was an albino if you were an
[03:43.000 --> 03:49.080]  albino they tortured you for a long period of time and then sacrificed you
[03:49.080 --> 03:52.280]  and then it was a succulent most delicious meat available but again I'm
[03:52.280 --> 03:56.960]  not supposed to make a cultural comment on that and say I judge that as a wicked
[03:56.960 --> 04:00.760]  culture just like I'm not supposed to judge the Nazis is wicked oh it's okay
[04:00.760 --> 04:05.800]  to judge that culture is wicked but don't judge Stalin or Mao or Pol Pot or
[04:05.800 --> 04:11.880]  anybody else is wicked but see that's the the the essence of freedom is being
[04:11.880 --> 04:17.960]  able to differentiate this wine tastes sour and bad this wine tastes good this
[04:17.960 --> 04:22.240]  chillerianio tastes delicious this one tastes rotten this peach tastes good
[04:22.240 --> 04:28.720]  this one tastes horrible I like purple grapes instead of green grapes everything
[04:28.720 --> 04:34.320]  is discrimination but they teach you that any discrimination of any type is
[04:34.320 --> 04:43.600]  evil so that you won't have a worldview on your own but I now digress I'm gonna
[04:43.600 --> 04:47.000]  get wound up here because there's a lot of stuff to cover on the other side of
[04:47.000 --> 04:52.720]  this break and we have Jan Irwin Irwin joining us that to get into TV mind

[06:14.560 --> 06:19.200]  menace influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling
[06:19.200 --> 06:24.440]  the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay

[07:57.960 --> 08:11.600]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[08:11.600 --> 08:19.120]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[08:19.120 --> 08:40.920]  Texas Alex Jones we've got John Irvin joining us reading over the reports that
[08:40.920 --> 08:49.240]  he's compiled it is stunningly accurate dealing with the admitted history of
[08:49.240 --> 08:52.880]  social engineering the fact that governments design the television
[08:52.880 --> 08:59.280]  flicker rate in rodent and primate and human studies to have a hypnotizing
[08:59.280 --> 09:06.880]  effect and it gets into animal psychology the rat studies of a rat maze how
[09:06.880 --> 09:12.440]  to make the rats consume the most and be the most controlled that's how super
[09:12.440 --> 09:18.240]  markets are set up when you think they're like a rat maze they are you need
[09:18.240 --> 09:22.840]  to be aware that most of the DARPA funding here in the United States which
[09:22.840 --> 09:29.600]  is over 90% of total research money through the federal government over 90
[09:29.600 --> 09:33.520]  percent of research money is federal goes to select corporations and
[09:33.520 --> 09:39.840]  universities and most of it is in human control you know we talk about how did
[09:39.840 --> 09:47.160]  the strongest toughest smartest most aggressive people in history historians
[09:47.160 --> 09:52.480]  from Europe historians from Asia came here and marveled at Americans because
[09:52.480 --> 09:58.000]  we were the stock of pirates swashbucklers freebooters criminals
[09:58.000 --> 10:07.000]  adventurers are religious fanatics as the media would describe it people that
[10:07.000 --> 10:13.120]  wanted to do things their own way the seeds of the United States are are just
[10:13.120 --> 10:19.240]  amazing the black folks that came here automatically were the strongest and the
[10:19.240 --> 10:23.880]  smartest in Africa why on average you can go back to the Atlantic slave trade
[10:23.880 --> 10:32.000]  reports from the 15 16 1700s and it's one of my favorite pastimes is to is to
[10:32.000 --> 10:37.640]  read naval history they have a lot of books that are our history books pretty
[10:37.640 --> 10:45.800]  much made up of French Portuguese Spanish Dutch and British trip logs rudders as
[10:45.800 --> 10:53.840]  they were called captain's logs and it describes the ships coming into the
[10:53.840 --> 11:00.640]  Gold Coast the slave coast of Western Africa and sometimes 80 90% of the crew
[11:00.640 --> 11:05.880]  would die from malaria they didn't know what was killing him and how they would
[11:05.880 --> 11:10.960]  have these debilitated forts where they were always having to ship new new
[11:10.960 --> 11:15.120]  administrators and how most of them would die so it wasn't just that half of
[11:15.120 --> 11:19.760]  the blacks that were shipped over here as slaves or to the Caribbean or
[11:19.760 --> 11:23.520]  Central or South America or North America wasn't just that half the blacks on
[11:23.520 --> 11:30.840]  average on average died and it's horrible stories of how depressed the blacks
[11:30.840 --> 11:34.120]  would be they would get the Africans up out of the bottom of the holds and
[11:34.120 --> 11:38.480]  quote dance them because if they didn't give them exercise they would die in the
[11:38.480 --> 11:43.320]  you know four to eight weeks depending on the winds journey across the Atlantic
[11:43.320 --> 11:47.200]  to the Americas and the blacks would be so that's what they're called the books
[11:47.200 --> 11:52.200]  the blacks would be so depressed that in many cases they have to dance them in
[11:52.200 --> 11:56.520]  chains because they would jump over the side of the ships they were so depressed
[11:56.520 --> 12:02.200]  leaving kidnapped from their families but most the people on the ships the
[12:02.200 --> 12:07.360]  white people were kidnapped they would send armored carriages out into the most
[12:07.360 --> 12:13.840]  rural areas and would actually run out into the fields where young men or young
[12:13.840 --> 12:19.440]  boys sometimes as young as age six were working and kidnapped them and so that's
[12:19.440 --> 12:23.960]  why piracy was so popular was you'd have mutinies because of the corruption and
[12:23.960 --> 12:28.160]  the people dying and then they would steal the ship kill kill the captain
[12:28.160 --> 12:33.840]  and take it and they would actually get blacks on board and that's why pirates
[12:33.840 --> 12:39.200]  are seen as one of the genesis of modern liberty because actually they they
[12:39.200 --> 12:42.960]  actually had a republic form of government some of them had a pure
[12:42.960 --> 12:48.560]  democracy on board the ship but but see that's the problem I have all this news
[12:48.560 --> 12:52.040]  and I'm digressing but if you don't know history you don't know what's happening
[12:52.040 --> 12:57.440]  currently but but but getting back to the incredible ruggedness of people
[12:57.440 --> 13:03.400]  especially in North America that's who it was made up of that's who it was made
[13:03.400 --> 13:08.120]  up of ships that had mutinied and and and run to the new world one of the
[13:08.120 --> 13:12.800]  favored places was New York to just beach the ship get off change your name
[13:12.800 --> 13:16.960]  that's why there's so many Joneses and Smiths because if you were a wanted man
[13:16.960 --> 13:20.200]  you change your name because records weren't very good to Jones or Smith or
[13:20.200 --> 13:25.000]  Johnson I myself we've tracked it all the way back to England I am a Jones but
[13:25.000 --> 13:29.040]  you can track it back actually the captain the Mayflower captain Jones on
[13:29.040 --> 13:33.400]  my dad's side and then my whole standish and one I forget the lady's name on my
[13:33.400 --> 13:38.120]  mother's side but digressing a lot that's why Jones is such a popular and
[13:38.120 --> 13:42.240]  Smith because they're not really Joneses they're not really Smith's ladies and
[13:42.240 --> 13:44.840]  gentlemen in fact most families don't even know why they have that name they
[13:44.840 --> 13:48.760]  don't know even what country they even originally came from people can't even
[13:48.760 --> 13:51.760]  tell you who their great great grandma was much less who they're great great
[13:51.760 --> 13:54.560]  great great great great great great great great great great great great great
[13:54.560 --> 13:57.840]  great great great great great great great great grandpa you know 12 generations
[13:57.840 --> 14:05.960]  ago or more was so America had most of the patents the ideas in war the most
[14:05.960 --> 14:09.200]  vicious I mean the British Empire never been beaten they came here and these
[14:09.200 --> 14:12.720]  people just wouldn't stop because they were the roughest they were the toughest
[14:12.720 --> 14:18.940]  of England and Germany and Scotland and Ireland and and and all those those
[14:18.940 --> 14:22.920]  people that came here the German Hessian military slaves so brainwashed they
[14:22.920 --> 14:28.880]  were happy to die and and didn't care that they were slaves you know Cicero
[14:28.880 --> 14:33.640]  Conan the barbarian you know 1750 you don't have to go back for German war
[14:33.640 --> 14:41.440]  slaves to the Highbury in a imaginary age before the sons of Arius and after
[14:41.440 --> 14:48.160]  the fall of Atlantis to you know to find German war slaves and they would
[14:48.160 --> 14:51.560]  never defect in all these big wars they would have but they would defect when
[14:51.560 --> 14:55.600]  they got to America and they were like you know this is a good idea I think I'm
[14:55.600 --> 14:59.280]  gonna change my name I think I'm gonna join the rebellion and that's what it's
[14:59.280 --> 15:03.080]  all about now how did they take this distillation there's only one other
[15:03.080 --> 15:07.760]  group anywhere similar and that's the Australians some of the same type
[15:07.760 --> 15:14.040]  shenanigans created that group of people wonderful folks you know I mean that
[15:14.040 --> 15:25.560]  great expression of just wild men across the board in fact the Spanish the
[15:25.560 --> 15:30.040]  French everybody that came here was an adventure the Portuguese that's why
[15:30.040 --> 15:35.240]  America has been so great and so outside the box and so rebellious how did they
[15:35.240 --> 15:40.400]  take these people who we are all of us Americans they demonize America they
[15:40.400 --> 15:43.280]  try to make you feel like you're not part of American history if you're black
[15:43.280 --> 15:47.680]  or Hispanic or Asian again the Asians that came here were the toughest work
[15:47.680 --> 15:53.440]  to death on the railroads if you came here I mean this was like going to Mars
[15:53.440 --> 15:59.640]  or something it was just absolute the natives that survived were the toughest
[15:59.640 --> 16:04.000]  the Native Americans and they were all just humans I don't romanticize and say
[16:04.000 --> 16:07.640]  any group was better than the other now the natives were constantly saying help
[16:07.640 --> 16:10.880]  us kill the other tribe we got a beef with them that's why the natives could
[16:10.880 --> 16:14.920]  be defeated even though they were more numerous and very tough was because they
[16:14.920 --> 16:18.480]  were always settling scores with each other and the global issues
[16:18.480 --> 16:23.280]  compartmentalization that is the imperialists that were manipulating the
[16:23.280 --> 16:29.520]  wild criminals and sharecroppers and pirates and religious charter groups
[16:29.520 --> 16:34.600]  that were being dumped in they wrote white papers that are public on what
[16:34.600 --> 16:39.000]  these groups would do same thing dumping off the prisoners and the debt
[16:39.000 --> 16:45.040]  slaves from the debtor prisons out of the streets of London and Belfast and
[16:45.040 --> 16:51.920]  Dublin and other areas into Australia you take them as your as your front line
[16:51.920 --> 16:58.320]  assault force you dump them out and say fight it out and most people died I mean
[16:58.320 --> 17:08.000]  you go back to the Jamestown colony everyone died you go back to the pilgrims
[17:08.000 --> 17:11.400]  what was it half of them died you can pull up the actual numbers I didn't get
[17:11.400 --> 17:16.960]  history wrong I was saying Caesar across the river cotton 44 BC it was 39 BC I
[17:16.960 --> 17:22.720]  just know the general general quadrants to understand all of this is to
[17:22.720 --> 17:29.440]  understand who we are how did we become this how did we go from being
[17:29.440 --> 17:38.800]  absolutely independent rugged people the the the the animalistic but also
[17:38.800 --> 17:46.800]  intelligence cream of the world coming here how did we become the slothful
[17:46.800 --> 17:50.800]  dumb-down creatures we are it was done through chemicals it was done through
[17:50.800 --> 17:53.960]  biologicals it was done through manipulation of the language and
[17:53.960 --> 18:02.320]  recognizing that we are under attack and recognizing that we have been
[18:02.320 --> 18:11.360]  denigrated and turned into shameful slobs is the beginning of turning this
[18:11.360 --> 18:15.680]  situation around and that's my point there okay now I'm going to try to
[18:15.680 --> 18:20.720]  discipline myself in the short little six-minute segments coming up
[18:20.720 --> 18:22.880]  and then the long ones coming up after that we'll get into more detail I'm
[18:22.880 --> 18:25.280]  going to try to discipline myself when we come back and just reach to the
[18:25.280 --> 18:28.480]  headlines and we all know I'm going to fail that's just the way it is but I'm
[18:28.480 --> 18:33.680]  going to try because I've probably got a hundred articles or more here and
[18:33.680 --> 18:37.040]  they're all off the chart important we're going to cover when we come back
[18:37.040 --> 18:42.080]  now before I go any further I just want to mention to listeners
[18:42.080 --> 18:46.320]  that we've caught YouTube censoring us again
[18:46.320 --> 18:49.760]  and they tend to just do this over and over again until we just give in
[18:49.760 --> 18:53.360]  and aren't upset or concerned about it anymore and that video that I shot is
[18:53.360 --> 18:57.440]  up on our YouTube channel today I shot it this morning
[18:57.440 --> 18:59.920]  with my children talking in the background but it's important I shot it
[18:59.920 --> 19:01.840]  it's up there we'll talk about that more later
[19:01.840 --> 19:05.360]  and because of censorship systems like that we've got to not
[19:05.360 --> 19:09.440]  just rely on Twitter and YouTube and things and Facebook we've got to build
[19:09.440 --> 19:13.520]  our own systems and we're doing that and one of them is low-tech email

[33:19.360 --> 33:24.080]  he's all of thirty one and he's only seventeen
[33:24.080 --> 33:28.960]  he's been a soldier for a thousand years
[33:28.960 --> 33:32.960]  he's a catholic a hinder an atheist
[33:32.960 --> 33:38.720]  a jain a Buddhist and a baptist and a jew
[33:38.720 --> 33:43.680]  and he knows he shouldn't kill and he knows he always will
[33:43.680 --> 33:48.400]  kill you for me my friend and me for you
[33:48.400 --> 33:53.520]  and he's fighting for canada he's fighting for France
[33:53.520 --> 34:00.640]  he's fighting for the USA and he's fighting for the russians and
[34:00.640 --> 34:05.040]  he's fighting for Japan and he thinks we'll put an end to
[34:05.040 --> 34:10.240]  war this way and he's fighting for democracy
[34:10.240 --> 34:17.040]  he's fighting for the reds he says it's for the peace of all
[34:17.040 --> 34:22.000]  he's the one who must decide who's to live and who's to die
[34:22.000 --> 34:26.480]  and he never sees the writing on the wall
[34:26.480 --> 34:30.080]  but without him how would Hitler have condemned him
[34:30.080 --> 34:35.920]  at labelle without him Caesar would have stood alone
[34:35.920 --> 34:40.720]  he's the one who gives his body as a weapon of the war
[34:40.720 --> 34:45.280]  and without him all his killing can't go on
[34:45.280 --> 34:50.240]  he's the universal soldier and he really is to blame
[34:50.240 --> 34:54.240]  his orders come from far away no more
[34:54.240 --> 34:58.160]  they come from here and there and you and me
[34:58.160 --> 35:08.400]  and brothers can't you see this is not the way we put the end to war
[35:08.400 --> 35:15.760]  but what do you do when you're for peace and people attack you
[35:15.760 --> 35:18.800]  then you've got to defend yourself and that's why there have always been
[35:18.800 --> 35:22.800]  militaries and armies and there always will be
[35:22.800 --> 35:26.880]  and what do you do when an enemy doesn't attack your system but you want to
[35:26.880 --> 35:30.720]  expand your borders you attack yourself and blame it on
[35:30.720 --> 35:33.200]  your enemy and it's one of the oldest tricks the
[35:33.200 --> 35:37.280]  romans used it the japanese used it the nazis used it the soviets
[35:37.280 --> 35:40.880]  used it the zars before him used it the brits you've used it it's been
[35:40.880 --> 35:44.960]  declassified countless times and yes our so-called government
[35:44.960 --> 35:49.280]  of course uses it as well it's called the false flag and it's taught in
[35:49.280 --> 35:53.360]  british and us army manuals that have been leaked by wiki leaks
[35:53.360 --> 35:57.120]  and are public and the pentagon admits they're real and wants to arrest
[35:57.120 --> 36:04.000]  whoever has released them oh but false flags don't exist
[36:04.000 --> 36:09.600]  i sat here a month ago when this bbc hit piece rolled into town
[36:09.600 --> 36:12.960]  and i know they've got my hands tied behind my back but i still do the
[36:12.960 --> 36:14.720]  interviews i don't know if i have a will in the
[36:14.720 --> 36:19.040]  future i refuse a lot of them now but um i probably wouldn't even have done it
[36:19.040 --> 36:22.800]  if i knew how slimy this individual particularly was i hadn't done any
[36:22.800 --> 36:28.800]  pre-research just to just bring it on uh and uh when the person got here i
[36:28.800 --> 36:33.440]  would bring up real historical examples they would just laugh at me
[36:33.440 --> 36:37.280]  gulf of tonk and operation a jack's operation gladio there was just i rolling
[36:37.280 --> 36:41.280]  giggling laughing i'd bring up the magic passports not one but two that survived
[36:41.280 --> 36:46.320]  911 crashes at ground zero and then were found by the fbi and he said oh i
[36:46.320 --> 36:50.400]  believe that you see because they're the rational
[36:50.400 --> 36:58.000]  people that believe whatever they're told okay uh dealing with war
[36:58.000 --> 37:01.760]  let me just give you some history obama said when he first announced for
[37:01.760 --> 37:04.640]  president and i know because we've covered this in the
[37:04.640 --> 37:08.720]  obama deception fall the republic the clips are in there
[37:08.720 --> 37:13.040]  that he would withdraw all the troops within six months
[37:13.040 --> 37:15.920]  he's the term immediately in press conferences and what is immediate
[37:15.920 --> 37:20.320]  within six months all troops a hundred percent out of iraq now he's been in
[37:20.320 --> 37:26.240]  office over two years now over two years uh coming up on three here pretty
[37:26.240 --> 37:32.720]  soon and uh he actually uh just renamed combat
[37:32.720 --> 37:38.880]  groups as combat support and increase the number of mercenaries and cut some
[37:38.880 --> 37:44.080]  us troops and sent them as part of a surge first 20 000 than another
[37:44.080 --> 37:49.680]  20 000 or so total about 50 000 regular troops marines army supplemented by
[37:49.680 --> 37:54.080]  other nato troops and then even more mercenaries in afghanistan
[37:54.080 --> 37:59.520]  and now uh of course uh what's happening in libya
[37:59.600 --> 38:03.120]  and so first he said immediate withdrawal that means six months he
[38:03.120 --> 38:07.520]  defined immediate as six months he defines things libya's not a war either
[38:07.520 --> 38:10.960]  then he said well they're gonna have to stay another year then another year
[38:10.960 --> 38:14.640]  and you notice it's always another year another year now in afghanistan oh
[38:14.640 --> 38:19.600]  we're going to in the next year and a half withdraw
[38:19.600 --> 38:23.840]  30 000 troops well that leaves 20 000 extra
[38:23.840 --> 38:28.080]  that weren't there when bush was in office so he puts in 50 000
[38:28.080 --> 38:31.520]  and then three years later announces in the next year and a half
[38:31.520 --> 38:35.840]  that he's going to withdraw 30 000 and that's withdrawing from afghanistan
[38:35.840 --> 38:40.240]  when that's 20 000 more than were there when he first got in office
[38:40.240 --> 38:43.440]  after they're taken out
[38:43.600 --> 38:47.040]  and now they're saying they're going to leave 10 000 us troops ladies and
[38:47.040 --> 38:53.040]  gentlemen they built six giant us bases of the green zone among them the
[38:53.040 --> 38:57.680]  largest us embassy in the world complete with liquor
[38:57.680 --> 39:02.560]  stores topless dancers porno shops uh shooting ranges bowling
[39:02.560 --> 39:07.120]  alleys i mean they are big armored systems and they're
[39:07.120 --> 39:09.360]  never leaving just like our troops have never left
[39:09.360 --> 39:12.800]  south korea they never left germany they've never left japan
[39:12.800 --> 39:16.880]  okay that was always the plan the pentagon back in 2002 before the
[39:16.880 --> 39:21.520]  invasion even started had put a well it wasn't even classified had plans for
[39:21.520 --> 39:25.120]  an indefinite well even shaney said a 100 year war
[39:25.120 --> 39:29.680]  we will be in iraq for 100 years he was at least honest
[39:29.680 --> 39:33.600]  about it but see obama we get to feel good and
[39:33.600 --> 39:37.360]  and and mainline liberals out there get to feel like man
[39:37.360 --> 39:40.160]  this guy's great he's given us free health care written by the insurance
[39:40.160 --> 39:43.280]  companies that actually cuts the level of care and doesn't cover pre-existing
[39:43.280 --> 39:46.000]  conditions and he gives waivers to all the big
[39:46.000 --> 39:49.040]  corporations that contribute to him and it's just total discrimination and
[39:49.040 --> 39:53.600]  corrupt but so what it feels good he's keeping the torture going expanding
[39:53.600 --> 39:58.240]  the secret arrest but hey he's trendy so okay great
[39:58.240 --> 40:02.800]  republicans are the same way when you know bush endorse global warming taxes
[40:02.800 --> 40:06.480]  uh and and all and they're like well at least he's a republican
[40:06.480 --> 40:09.920]  it's idiocy they work for the very same global corporate interests
[40:09.920 --> 40:16.400]  that are the opposite of free market and so now they are announcing uh obama
[40:16.400 --> 40:22.000]  has announced that okay uh now uh a uh you know he promised by the end of
[40:22.000 --> 40:25.360]  december that they'd be completely removed but now they're gonna
[40:25.360 --> 40:29.440]  back up a decision even into the new year and and and then
[40:29.440 --> 40:32.640]  they'll talk about reducing it down to 10 000 trips
[40:32.640 --> 40:35.760]  from the reported 60 000 that are there not counting all the contractors and
[40:35.760 --> 40:39.600]  there's over 150 000 of those where you pay even more money for it as we go
[40:39.600 --> 40:44.320]  bankrupt lots of uh you know haliburton
[40:44.320 --> 40:48.640]  15 million dollar uh blue tarp tents that cost $200
[40:48.640 --> 40:51.760]  and lots of $800 hammers and $700 toilet seats
[40:51.760 --> 40:54.560]  of course those were numbers in the 80s in congressional hearings it's
[40:54.560 --> 40:58.320]  it's it's it's much worse today and boy if you can get the toilet seat or the
[40:58.320 --> 41:01.280]  blue tarp contract you are sitting pretty
[41:01.280 --> 41:04.240]  you get a few million bucks for the campaign of somebody
[41:04.240 --> 41:07.680]  like the president a few hundred thousand to congress people
[41:07.680 --> 41:10.800]  you buy off a few hundred of them and then you get trillions of dollars well
[41:10.800 --> 41:17.200]  that is our congress our government is like a vending machine
[41:17.200 --> 41:21.840]  and if uh that's why uh big democrat big globalist uh
[41:21.840 --> 41:26.160]  who everybody hailed as the great conservative donald trump supported
[41:26.160 --> 41:29.440]  imminent domain he wants your property for a casino
[41:29.440 --> 41:33.200]  by golly they're gonna bulldoze your neighborhood and in these imminent
[41:33.200 --> 41:36.720]  domain disputes they now come to you this is on record and we we covered it in
[41:36.720 --> 41:41.040]  osmium you know with the uh connecticut cases and others and the
[41:41.040 --> 41:46.160]  gore seafood down in uh corpus christie texas
[41:46.160 --> 41:50.240]  and many other cases where the the government comes to you and says
[41:50.240 --> 41:54.400]  we're going to take your property and if you don't take what we're first
[41:54.400 --> 41:59.600]  offering within six weeks we are going to have the government take it and pay
[41:59.600 --> 42:03.840]  you nothing in fact for the and if you sue us and
[42:03.840 --> 42:07.280]  and fight it and it takes a year or so when we get the judgment
[42:07.280 --> 42:10.640]  we're going to charge you for rent and then you're going to actually owe us
[42:10.640 --> 42:13.520]  money that happened with many of people that
[42:13.520 --> 42:17.200]  fought it so imminent domain isn't just that they take your property now
[42:17.200 --> 42:23.440]  imminent domain now and by the way we own a family farm slash ranch
[42:23.440 --> 42:26.880]  in east texas that we've had since 1829 1830
[42:26.880 --> 42:30.880]  mexican land grant what's left of it generationally it gets sold off in
[42:30.880 --> 42:34.880]  things but it was a ponderosa style thing a hundred years ago
[42:34.880 --> 42:38.480]  it's still pretty big but but but we're land rich money pours you got to pay the
[42:38.480 --> 42:42.480]  property taxes on it and now you can't have hobby farms where you have a farm
[42:42.480 --> 42:44.960]  in a ranch just to try to pay the taxes no it's got to be
[42:44.960 --> 42:48.880]  profitable or the feds then don't let you you know you know exempt the money
[42:48.880 --> 42:52.960]  you're spending on it uh and and and again that's all
[42:52.960 --> 42:57.680]  part of openly running out people that are that are on the land
[42:57.680 --> 43:00.880]  most people in the country again have a job in town and they work at night or on
[43:00.880 --> 43:04.880]  the weekends or and that's all over that's all being phased out but
[43:04.880 --> 43:07.760]  obviously getting into that story oh yeah a couple years ago my dad gets a
[43:07.760 --> 43:11.360]  letter from the state saying well we changed the law in texas
[43:11.360 --> 43:14.880]  and now if anybody ever wants to build a pipeline or a road
[43:14.880 --> 43:22.880]  or anything on your property you have to accept what you're offered
[43:22.880 --> 43:28.320]  in six weeks or we'll just take it and pay you nothing and of course that's
[43:28.320 --> 43:30.720]  not even really enforceable but a lot of people get
[43:30.720 --> 43:34.320]  buffaloed by it i mean it's this is the culture of corruption
[43:34.320 --> 43:39.440]  it's like 10 years ago i had a hundred thousand dollar house
[43:39.440 --> 43:45.040]  my first home and uh my mortgage got sold three or four times and so i was
[43:45.040 --> 43:49.680]  every month being getting a letter where to send my my payment
[43:49.680 --> 43:54.000]  and bank of america bought my mortgage and they sent me letters and said your
[43:54.000 --> 43:56.960]  three thousand dollars in escrow hasn't been paid we're taking and i sent them
[43:56.960 --> 44:00.560]  letters with copies of the escrow and they said we're going to start foreclosure
[44:00.560 --> 44:04.000]  on you and i had to go get a lawyer and start the lawsuit process and they said
[44:04.000 --> 44:08.320]  oh yes we found the documents but see if i was
[44:08.400 --> 44:14.000]  old or sick or or or wasn't halfway intelligent i wouldn't know how to do
[44:14.000 --> 44:17.360]  that and i would just freak out and and and not know what to do and probably
[44:17.360 --> 44:21.760]  just pay them again but even better if i didn't pay
[44:21.760 --> 44:24.560]  and go along with the fraud i would have had my home taken
[44:24.560 --> 44:27.920]  and i know people that have had their houses taken
[44:27.920 --> 44:33.600]  in just that way remember bank of america uh just a few months ago
[44:33.600 --> 44:37.360]  got caught in florida and for six months or five months that you know the
[44:37.360 --> 44:40.160]  judge said you took a million dollar house
[44:40.160 --> 44:43.680]  that was paid for in cash that you never had a deed in in any history you
[44:43.680 --> 44:46.720]  never had a connection to this property not five owners back
[44:46.720 --> 44:50.880]  you just stole it and in previous courts went along with their fraud and they
[44:50.880 --> 44:54.480]  get up in court and swear they own it with with no deed no documentation and
[44:54.480 --> 44:58.080]  they took the house the people sued them beat them and the judge did the right
[44:58.080 --> 45:01.360]  thing and had the deputies go in and take the money
[45:01.360 --> 45:09.120]  out of the the bank vault and and and pay them for the house
[45:09.120 --> 45:13.520]  that they'd stolen and the bank was actually the bank manager was saying
[45:13.520 --> 45:16.080]  we're bank of america you can't do this and the cops were like
[45:16.080 --> 45:19.520]  hey we got a sworn thing right here buddy see
[45:19.520 --> 45:23.120]  that's the power of real courts that's the power of real justice
[45:23.120 --> 45:27.280]  that should be going on everywhere and then people wouldn't be scared
[45:27.280 --> 45:30.880]  when they saw a cop behind them they wouldn't be i mean i've
[45:30.880 --> 45:35.120]  checked the uh the sociology the the more recent anthropology
[45:35.120 --> 45:38.240]  there's always been corrupt police forces in places like you know chicago
[45:38.240 --> 45:42.480]  and new york but in most places cops were like known in the community
[45:42.480 --> 45:45.280]  everybody's bringing them coffee pies everybody liked them and they were
[45:45.280 --> 45:48.880]  invited over to play dominoes or whatever you know and the cops had a feeling
[45:48.880 --> 45:51.280]  of defending people and wanted to go after criminals
[45:51.280 --> 45:56.160]  and when crimes were committed cops would work overtime to find out who did it
[45:56.160 --> 45:59.760]  now it's just the complete opposite they're there to raise
[45:59.760 --> 46:04.640]  revenue but when the police are the right thing when they become true servants
[46:04.640 --> 46:08.400]  of the people and the law that's a beautiful thing
[46:08.400 --> 46:11.840]  was those sheriff's deputies and constables going in there
[46:11.840 --> 46:15.440]  and saying we're taking the money out of the vault if you don't write us a check
[46:15.440 --> 46:18.000]  right now and they said no we're not gonna do it so they
[46:18.000 --> 46:21.680]  open that vault we're getting that money and they said whoa whoa whoa i'll
[46:21.680 --> 46:24.400]  write you the check they got on the phone to headquarters we'll
[46:24.400 --> 46:27.200]  write you the check
[46:28.560 --> 46:31.760]  that's justice that's what's supposed to happen in fact
[46:31.760 --> 46:36.880]  they're not the the the bureaucrats the executives at that bank
[46:36.880 --> 46:42.800]  that swore under oaths to take the house years before took them years of fighting
[46:42.800 --> 46:47.920]  then the judgment for five months to pay it back
[46:47.920 --> 46:51.280]  they should all be indicted for fraud i mean that's
[46:51.280 --> 46:56.000]  hardcore fraud you know the IRS is always changing rules and and and and
[46:56.000 --> 46:58.800]  sending you letters saying oh you owe this money because you didn't calculate
[46:58.800 --> 47:01.440]  this right and the whole thing's a fraud it's
[47:01.440 --> 47:04.640]  paid the private federal reserve we didn't have the IRS till 1913
[47:04.640 --> 47:08.800]  it wasn't enforced till the 1950s
[47:08.800 --> 47:12.560]  got it the same year we got the private federal reserve it all goes to debt
[47:12.560 --> 47:15.120]  because the government doesn't issue its own currency they have to get
[47:15.120 --> 47:18.080]  authorization from the private federal reserve and then debt is created
[47:18.080 --> 47:21.600]  when the dollar is created so they had to have that income tax just to pay the
[47:21.600 --> 47:25.200]  banksters just like the carbon tax is a new global tax to be paid
[47:25.200 --> 47:30.320]  directly to them so you have the right to breathe and operate and live
[47:30.320 --> 47:34.800]  and they knew exactly what they were doing then
[47:34.800 --> 47:38.640]  we built this country without the IRS but the IRS can make mistakes all the

[54:19.600 --> 54:24.240]  into a lot of the news i am pontificating on sociology anthropology
[54:24.240 --> 54:27.760]  psychology because if you don't understand that you understand nothing
[54:27.760 --> 54:31.680]  uh but we told you this was coming um they ordered them about six months ago
[54:31.680 --> 54:35.600]  in australia and the united states hundreds of millions of dollars of
[54:35.600 --> 54:38.960]  super high powered it's kind of like the old
[54:38.960 --> 54:42.560]  tasers were killing a lot of people so now they increase the power
[54:42.560 --> 54:47.680]  about a year ago uh and now they've got shotgun fired ones that are
[54:47.680 --> 54:52.720]  much more powerful well now alkyda is going to sew the bombs in the
[54:52.720 --> 54:56.880]  breast uh and in the stomachs and so we've got to go
[54:56.880 --> 55:02.240]  ahead and actually uh hit you with uh something akin to a chest x-ray
[55:02.240 --> 55:05.920]  i heard this on fox news driving in this morning on 5 9 a.m
[55:05.920 --> 55:10.000]  and sure enough steve watson has a big report out on it belly bombs
[55:10.000 --> 55:15.520]  government claims phantom terrorist will surgically implant
[55:15.520 --> 55:20.080]  explosives in humans so directly from dr strange love to the pages of our
[55:20.080 --> 55:24.000]  newspapers today a large group of belly bombs
[55:24.000 --> 55:28.640]  coincidentally new full strength body scanners are ready to be rolled out
[55:28.640 --> 55:31.840]  a year before the underwear bomber two christmases ago
[55:31.840 --> 55:36.880]  they ordered over a billion dollars of naked body scanners to go in 214 airports
[55:36.880 --> 55:40.640]  and the first group was ready for delivery and was and was to be put in
[55:40.640 --> 55:43.680]  and we were talking about it on air oh my gosh next year the scanners are going
[55:43.680 --> 55:47.520]  in most airports and then magically the underwear bomber on christmas day has
[55:47.520 --> 55:50.400]  gotten on the plane protected by the state department on record
[55:50.400 --> 55:53.760]  and pops a firecracker in his pants he looks drugged out
[55:53.760 --> 56:00.560]  and then magically magically absolutely magically
[56:00.560 --> 56:04.960]  um they announced oh we're gonna put scanners in because of this
[56:04.960 --> 56:07.920]  but they already ordered the scanners they were already ready and then that
[56:07.920 --> 56:11.920]  happened so oh i kept telling you they're gonna have to chest x-ray you
[56:11.920 --> 56:15.040]  and australia says they're gonna go with the system that is a chest x-ray
[56:15.040 --> 56:17.760]  and you want to fly that's the way it is people say well they just don't fly
[56:17.760 --> 56:22.080]  uh well now it's on the highways it's at the proms the bus stations the train
[56:22.080 --> 56:27.120]  stations i said i get into the parents and the whole case of the um
[56:27.120 --> 56:32.160]  the whole case of uh cps and i'm gonna cover that then in the third hour
[56:32.160 --> 56:35.600]  before jimmy justice who goes around showing the police
[56:35.600 --> 56:40.880]  violating their own laws uh in new york city it's a pretty funny stuff cops
[56:40.880 --> 56:44.400]  drinking in their cars smoking cigarettes cigars cops parking in
[56:44.400 --> 56:47.680]  handicapped spots police parking in front of fire hydrants while they're
[56:47.680 --> 56:50.720]  doing personal shopping then they come over an assault team i mean
[56:50.720 --> 56:53.600]  there's hundreds of videos on his youtube channel
[56:53.600 --> 56:57.360]  he's really nice and polite too he waits till they come over and start
[56:57.360 --> 56:59.840]  you know attacking him till he even really says anything in most of the
[56:59.840 --> 57:03.200]  videos that there's so many of them i don't even know what videos to play here
[57:03.200 --> 57:07.520]  i don't even know where to um where to start but
[57:07.520 --> 57:12.560]  with this cps takes custody of six kids living with parents
[57:12.560 --> 57:16.160]  uh in storage shed
[57:17.440 --> 57:20.720]  i heard these poor parents on the news this morning
[57:20.720 --> 57:24.400]  and he lost his job i mean what do you do
[57:24.400 --> 57:29.040]  i think in areas of california and hawaii they lock the homeless up at night
[57:29.040 --> 57:31.920]  just like england would do in the poor house
[57:31.920 --> 57:34.880]  and it's it's that's how concentration camps begin that's what hitler said in
[57:34.880 --> 57:38.080]  germany oh there's poor people that we've made live in the ghettos
[57:38.080 --> 57:40.880]  and so now i'm going to put you in these camps for your own safety and you'll
[57:40.880 --> 57:44.560]  work you know to pay for yourself and then we know what that grew into
[57:44.560 --> 57:47.600]  and so now as real families begin to go homeless
[57:47.600 --> 57:51.040]  this guy then when he lost his job within six weeks
[57:51.040 --> 57:57.760]  got a job he got the job at the storage shed facility and he said
[57:57.760 --> 58:01.120]  and the illegal aliens live in these all the time as well but they're left alone
[58:01.120 --> 58:05.600]  and he put air conditioning in and he put a refrigeration they could use the
[58:05.600 --> 58:08.960]  storage facilities bathrooms and he just about
[58:08.960 --> 58:12.720]  you know living there for a couple years gotten enough money to to move out he
[58:12.720 --> 58:16.560]  was getting close to that but he was working
[58:16.560 --> 58:20.240]  and i mean i gotta tell you i've had some hillbilly
[58:20.240 --> 58:24.080]  cousins and people that lived in shacks they weren't as nice as a shed
[58:24.080 --> 58:28.640]  i visited family that you know they were just one step up from dirt floors
[58:28.640 --> 58:32.480]  do they have their children taken and so

[01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:28.720]  snakes the amphibians the frogs are our our our hemaphrodites and if they're
[01:02:28.720 --> 01:02:32.400]  not physically hemaphrodites they're mentally hemaphrodites and then don't
[01:02:32.400 --> 01:02:36.000]  breed have no desire to this is what we're taking
[01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.880]  cancer doubled the last decade don't believe me just search that term you'll
[01:02:38.880 --> 01:02:43.280]  get msnbc ap diabetes doubled the last decade

[01:02:47.200 --> 01:02:54.240]  it's all following an exact graph uh so i mean that's the big service
[01:02:54.240 --> 01:02:57.760]  announcement here public service announcement environmental factors may
[01:02:57.760 --> 01:03:00.160]  play a greater role in autism than previously thought
[01:03:00.160 --> 01:03:04.160]  oh who would have thought if people say they're they're they're over

[01:03:11.600 --> 01:03:15.920]  might be some to that but look when i was going to school
[01:03:15.920 --> 01:03:19.200]  20 years ago there was a couple autistic kids in the school
[01:03:19.200 --> 01:03:23.760]  now uh you go to a school event or something

[01:04:22.960 --> 01:04:25.840]  didn't fake their science still that you know they put out these
[01:04:25.840 --> 01:04:29.520]  hoaxes to make you think everything's okay you know everything's not okay you
[01:04:29.520 --> 01:04:32.080]  talk to any cancer doctor they'll tell you when they were in
[01:04:32.080 --> 01:04:35.760]  residency in medical school they would sometimes have to travel by train or
[01:04:35.760 --> 01:04:39.040]  plane across the country to see a child with cancer
[01:04:39.040 --> 01:04:42.240]  it was like finding uh pinocchioers it was like finding

[01:06:03.600 --> 01:06:07.760]  power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double or
[01:06:07.760 --> 01:06:11.040]  triple your electric bill number two our new energies are
[01:06:11.040 --> 01:06:14.720]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have
[01:06:14.720 --> 01:06:17.600]  it's true total government control of electricity
[01:06:17.600 --> 01:06:20.320]  in the name of smart grid technology is coming
[01:06:20.320 --> 01:06:24.000]  number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:27.040]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation
[01:06:27.040 --> 01:06:30.880]  is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a
[01:06:30.880 --> 01:06:34.240]  threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their
[01:06:34.240 --> 01:06:38.000]  power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator
[01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.880]  provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind
[01:06:40.880 --> 01:06:43.920]  folks i really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from
[01:06:43.920 --> 01:06:46.640]  science one of my old sponsors you can get more
[01:06:46.640 --> 01:06:51.920]  information at www.mysolarbackup.com that's mysolarbackup.com
[01:06:51.920 --> 01:06:56.000]  remember the government doesn't own the sun so go to mysolarbackup.com

[01:07:01.120 --> 01:07:05.120]  hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone
[01:07:05.120 --> 01:07:08.320]  this is our last chance to not relive history
[01:07:08.320 --> 01:07:12.320]  is it finishing off this agenda that we're pulling the rug from underneath
[01:07:12.320 --> 01:07:15.520]  americans at home i've turned a tremendous influence
[01:07:15.520 --> 01:07:19.520]  on our president in congress and they really are calling the shots
[01:07:19.520 --> 01:07:24.800]  i think it's incumbent upon all of us as american citizens to pay attention
[01:07:24.800 --> 01:07:28.000]  fall of the republic identifies the enemies of our nation
[01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:32.400]  the criminal off-short cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty
[01:07:32.400 --> 01:07:35.680]  and on its ashes constructing world government tim geithner
[01:07:35.680 --> 01:07:38.720]  Bernanke their arsonists they're asking for more matches
[01:07:38.720 --> 01:07:42.160]  and the congress is saying who do we make the checkout to today seems like
[01:07:42.160 --> 01:07:45.600]  nobody does care and right now in washington dc
[01:07:45.600 --> 01:07:50.800]  we have seen a fall of the republic yet your copy of fall of the republic on
[01:07:50.800 --> 01:07:55.840]  dvd at info wars dot com we're watching online right now in super

[01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:09.760]  the information war continues it's alex jones
[01:08:09.760 --> 01:08:13.680]  and the gcn radio network
[01:08:15.440 --> 01:08:20.160]  we're going to yawn urwin here in just a moment
[01:08:20.160 --> 01:08:24.240]  i've read many of his articles online we linked some of them at info wars dot
[01:08:24.240 --> 01:08:28.400]  com and prison planet dot com and a spot on his research about the admission
[01:08:28.400 --> 01:08:32.960]  that television the culture all of it is designed to
[01:08:32.960 --> 01:08:37.120]  basically turn us into mind numbed brain damaged
[01:08:37.120 --> 01:08:41.760]  adult servile cowardly creatures and the establishment
[01:08:41.760 --> 01:08:46.160]  writes thousands of white papers tens of thousands of studies
[01:08:46.160 --> 01:08:50.080]  all of it and i want to break down television this psychological warfare
[01:08:50.080 --> 01:08:55.280]  weapon with him today
[01:08:55.280 --> 01:08:58.560]  also then coming up the next hour i want to break down the fact that even if
[01:08:58.560 --> 01:09:01.440]  you're working and trying to take care of your family
[01:09:01.440 --> 01:09:05.360]  now but you're poor the cps is going to take your children how this is part of
[01:09:05.360 --> 01:09:08.640]  the new poor house plan and that's why they say they want to post
[01:09:08.640 --> 01:09:12.400]  industrial world in previous times and in china and other places if
[01:09:12.400 --> 01:09:15.440]  you're poor you can still keep your children now they're going to take your
[01:09:15.440 --> 01:09:19.440]  children even if you're poor similar to what happened in the 2030s
[01:09:19.440 --> 01:09:22.960]  into the 40s with the hundreds of thousands of sterilizations
[01:09:22.960 --> 01:09:26.800]  single mothers having their children taken uh and then now of course they
[01:09:26.800 --> 01:09:29.760]  adopt them out to the alternative lifestyle folks
[01:09:29.760 --> 01:09:33.040]  i don't even i'm not even i don't even dislike the alternative lifestyle
[01:09:33.040 --> 01:09:36.240]  people which that that i know the cps hunts children
[01:09:36.240 --> 01:09:39.680]  for them and most of those folks that are adopting kids
[01:09:39.680 --> 01:09:44.160]  aren't even aware of that and i think it's a great evil but again i'm
[01:09:44.160 --> 01:09:48.160]  being a homophobic now because i don't want my children harvested
[01:09:48.160 --> 01:09:52.160]  by the state for no reason so that people that don't reproduce can have them
[01:09:52.160 --> 01:09:56.240]  again not i mean just stating facts is is is evil and i understand that
[01:09:56.240 --> 01:10:00.080]  and uh saying that this new war is not a uh is a war is
[01:10:00.080 --> 01:10:05.360]  is is also racist as youtube said criticizing obama is now racist we've
[01:10:05.360 --> 01:10:08.240]  been given strikes and they may shut the site down
[01:10:08.240 --> 01:10:12.000]  we have new videos out on that today because they say criticism of obama
[01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:15.280]  in their letter to us is racism and if you're against government run health
[01:10:15.280 --> 01:10:18.720]  care you're a racist uh as well i'm not joking i mean you heard
[01:10:18.720 --> 01:10:23.680]  him say on msnbc okay if you have an opinion about what color
[01:10:23.680 --> 01:10:26.800]  sheets you like if you like blue sheets instead of pink sheets
[01:10:26.800 --> 01:10:31.600]  you are racist against uh some blue skinned alien race that we don't know
[01:10:31.600 --> 01:10:35.040]  about i mean it's all about playing us off against each other and creating
[01:10:35.040 --> 01:10:38.640]  this false reality where we run around and nitty about issues of little or no
[01:10:38.640 --> 01:10:41.840]  significance i want to get into cisco and others helping build the
[01:10:41.840 --> 01:10:46.000]  technological control grid in china 500 000 cameras to
[01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:49.920]  engage in pre-crime tracking the same systems going in all over the united
[01:10:49.920 --> 01:10:52.480]  states including public schools which should be named
[01:10:52.480 --> 01:10:57.920]  reeducation uh camps also uh in the next hour i i want to get into
[01:10:57.920 --> 01:11:01.760]  fda and leashes in-game scheme to outlaw virtually all dietary supplements
[01:11:01.760 --> 01:11:05.280]  formulated after 1994 that's mike adams at info wars
[01:11:05.280 --> 01:11:13.520]  dot com with that report uh we're also going to get into this extremely draconian
[01:11:13.520 --> 01:11:17.680]  prop protect ip act gives government power to seize websites on a whim
[01:11:17.680 --> 01:11:20.720]  law professors warn that new legislation allows state to seize
[01:11:20.720 --> 01:11:24.960]  websites merely for linking to other websites that host copyrighted
[01:11:24.960 --> 01:11:29.120]  uh material no judge no jury they just take your website in
[01:11:29.120 --> 01:11:33.040]  europe and russia are trying to pass similar things all these government
[01:11:33.040 --> 01:11:37.280]  corrupt systems are scared well i mean they should be scared
[01:11:37.280 --> 01:11:41.520]  again our eight youtube channels just the ones we run
[01:11:41.520 --> 01:11:47.680]  or that we're affiliated with have over 300 million views
[01:11:47.680 --> 01:11:52.400]  300 million views uh one youtube channel has a hundred and you know 25 million
[01:11:52.400 --> 01:11:55.680]  and we don't even really promote it
[01:11:57.200 --> 01:12:00.800]  the super bowl has 65 million views and makes hundreds of millions of dollars
[01:12:00.800 --> 01:12:03.280]  i've done the math people that have youtube ads
[01:12:03.280 --> 01:12:08.560]  who get 10 million views they might get 10 000 dollars
[01:12:08.560 --> 01:12:13.440]  on a 60 second ad on a television show with 10 million viewers
[01:12:13.440 --> 01:12:17.440]  is generally about 400 000 so see the establishment
[01:12:17.440 --> 01:12:21.840]  has it set where they get 400 000 for their 10 million views
[01:12:21.840 --> 01:12:25.920]  and you get maybe 10 000
[01:12:25.920 --> 01:12:30.800]  see it's all fraud it's all false reality they're the people spending the
[01:12:30.800 --> 01:12:34.640]  false reality by design and trying to get us to buy into it
[01:12:34.640 --> 01:12:38.160]  and then if you have critical thinking skills we're now confirming that
[01:12:38.160 --> 01:12:41.200]  people that don't want to be groped are being called conspiracy theorists having
[01:12:41.200 --> 01:12:44.240]  an opinion that you're groping me no that's a conspiracy
[01:12:44.240 --> 01:12:48.000]  that's heresy i say i control reality if you're a medical worker and you go
[01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.720]  back say i don't want to fly around anymore because they're groping me you
[01:12:50.720 --> 01:12:53.520]  know the boss says to the guy that sells medical equipment
[01:12:53.520 --> 01:12:56.960]  well you're a conspiracy theorist see you're not even allowed to have your
[01:12:56.960 --> 01:13:00.320]  own view or your own body now or if you know
[01:13:00.320 --> 01:13:03.760]  this phenol a is destroying our sexual identities
[01:13:03.760 --> 01:13:07.280]  and feminizing men and hyper-feminizing women and giving them breast cancer
[01:13:07.280 --> 01:13:10.400]  doesn't matter how many thousands of studies you have you're somebody who's
[01:13:10.400 --> 01:13:14.000]  concerned about reality you're a weirdo you're a kook
[01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:18.080]  you're dangerous it's your fault i get told that i talk about the ponzi scheme
[01:13:18.080 --> 01:13:20.880]  in banking and then it's going to be my fault
[01:13:20.880 --> 01:13:25.680]  that the economy implodes even though the central banks designed it to
[01:13:25.680 --> 01:13:29.520]  consolidate the economy in their own documents that have been leaked 2002
[01:13:29.520 --> 01:13:33.200]  imf world bank documents and others even though they admit what they're doing
[01:13:33.200 --> 01:13:37.200]  i've got to just say oh they're keeping me safe because if i don't and the
[01:13:37.200 --> 01:13:40.480]  economy falls apart it's my fault my fault for
[01:13:40.480 --> 01:13:43.440]  for living in reality my fault for being informed
[01:13:43.440 --> 01:13:46.960]  my fault for not being lazy my fault for not wanting to be a collectivist
[01:13:46.960 --> 01:13:49.600]  now for the rest of the hour hopefully a little bit into the next because i'm
[01:13:49.600 --> 01:13:55.680]  going to him a bit later is yon ervin and i know a lot of the
[01:13:55.680 --> 01:14:01.520]  folks here in the office are big admirers of his work
[01:14:01.520 --> 01:14:05.200]  and we post some of his reports up at info wars
[01:14:05.200 --> 01:14:11.840]  dot com and prison planet dot com and here's one tv
[01:14:11.840 --> 01:14:15.040]  well here's an article that breaks down a lot of what he talks about tv is a
[01:14:15.040 --> 01:14:19.360]  psychosocial weapon and this this report goes through
[01:14:19.360 --> 01:14:23.760]  uh the admitted government studies where they admit they're putting you
[01:14:23.760 --> 01:14:28.800]  into a trance and uh also the lvx system ceiling lights and
[01:14:28.800 --> 01:14:33.440]  coded internet data turns out that that's also designed to to manipulate
[01:14:33.440 --> 01:14:37.200]  the human brain you know that's how they hypnotize he's a flashing light
[01:14:37.200 --> 01:14:41.200]  um project mk ultra all of it we're going to talk about this
[01:14:41.200 --> 01:14:50.240]  with uh one ervin uh right on yon ervin i'm a little brain dead today my friend
[01:14:50.240 --> 01:14:56.720]  how about i call you bob bob uh uh ervin there you go but but you're joining
[01:14:56.720 --> 01:15:01.680]  us via a video skype yon uh now you're don one or
[01:15:01.680 --> 01:15:05.680]  carl young uh there you go uh describe yourself for people
[01:15:05.680 --> 01:15:08.880]  because you got a long bio how would you like to describe yourself
[01:15:08.880 --> 01:15:12.320]  well i'm an author i've written a couple of books on
[01:15:12.320 --> 01:15:18.800]  entheogens and religion i run a podcast i am the curator for the official
[01:15:18.800 --> 01:15:23.680]  john allegro website he was a dead sea scroll scholar whose research was
[01:15:23.680 --> 01:15:28.320]  suppressed i also run trivium education dot com and
[01:15:28.320 --> 01:15:32.320]  uh helping people which is a website dedicated to teaching people the
[01:15:32.320 --> 01:15:35.760]  trivium which is a systematic method for driving certainty
[01:15:35.760 --> 01:15:39.600]  to cut through the mind control system so that people can see how everything
[01:15:39.600 --> 01:15:42.320]  works which is what you're talking about reality testing you're talking about
[01:15:42.320 --> 01:15:45.840]  reality testing right yeah and that's really what i would like
[01:15:45.840 --> 01:15:51.520]  to go into to today with you alex is the trivium method and how it's used
[01:15:51.520 --> 01:15:56.800]  in media against us uh to control the population
[01:15:56.800 --> 01:16:02.480]  well bob uh ervin you've got the floor and and my name is now uh uh uh bill
[01:16:02.480 --> 01:16:08.320]  jones so uh i was thinking i was thinking christie
[01:16:08.320 --> 01:16:12.640]  okay uh all right let me let me start off by asking you a question alex
[01:16:12.640 --> 01:16:17.440]  what what happens when you get a virus on your computer
[01:16:17.440 --> 01:16:23.920]  well you generally respond by uh going and um
[01:16:23.920 --> 01:16:27.120]  well let me let me put it this way what happens to the way the computer
[01:16:27.120 --> 01:16:31.280]  functions when you get a virus it stops functioning correctly because
[01:16:31.280 --> 01:16:36.160]  disinformation has been added in uh that uh destroys its proper
[01:16:36.160 --> 01:16:38.880]  functioning and that's what happens when we bring in
[01:16:38.880 --> 01:16:46.240]  false uh systems false ideas uh into our minds yeah exactly right
[01:16:46.240 --> 01:16:50.720]  and there is an ancient system that was developed primarily by
[01:16:50.720 --> 01:16:55.040]  Pythagoras and Aristotle called the trivium and quadrivium it composes the
[01:16:55.040 --> 01:16:58.720]  seven liberal arts and what they've done is
[01:16:58.720 --> 01:17:03.040]  since the 1850s the trivium has been systematically removed from our
[01:17:03.040 --> 01:17:08.080]  education system and many of us will remember your
[01:17:08.080 --> 01:17:13.520]  former co-host jason bermus and uh his partner dylan avry when they were on
[01:17:13.520 --> 01:17:17.520]  democracy now with amy goodman and against popular mechanics
[01:17:17.520 --> 01:17:23.760]  and if you go through that there was a a a line of communication that fell
[01:17:23.760 --> 01:17:27.280]  through there that jason and dylan could have picked up on
[01:17:27.280 --> 01:17:31.680]  the popular mechanics was primarily using against them they fell into a lot of
[01:17:31.680 --> 01:17:34.880]  the traps themselves but what i want to do today
[01:17:34.880 --> 01:17:38.480]  is to show people basically how to install
[01:17:38.480 --> 01:17:42.960]  a mental antivirus system into their minds so that they can spot how this
[01:17:42.960 --> 01:17:48.240]  stuff is being used against them spot the logical fallacies and then keep
[01:17:48.240 --> 01:17:52.720]  the conversation uh directed specifically towards the
[01:17:52.720 --> 01:17:58.560]  topic and discussion now for instance uh with 911 we can make our you know how
[01:17:58.560 --> 01:18:02.400]  can we make our arguments as solid as possible against attack
[01:18:02.400 --> 01:18:06.480]  and uh let me just move my camera here sorry if that's going crazy now please
[01:18:06.480 --> 01:18:13.200]  do and so with the 911 stuff
[01:18:13.200 --> 01:18:17.520]  what we need to do is go back and we need to analyze our grammar before we come
[01:18:17.520 --> 01:18:21.360]  to our logical conclusions what's happening to the quote unquote truth
[01:18:21.360 --> 01:18:24.560]  movement is most of us are typically putting our
[01:18:24.560 --> 01:18:28.320]  logic before a grammar we're putting our conclusions before we have sufficient
[01:18:28.320 --> 01:18:30.800]  data to back them up and this is what the
[01:18:30.800 --> 01:18:34.800]  trivium is about the trivium specifically is grammar logic and
[01:18:34.800 --> 01:18:39.760]  rhetoric and it's always in that order now not using the trivium
[01:18:39.760 --> 01:18:43.760]  is like put or putting logic before grammar is like trying to eat your food
[01:18:43.760 --> 01:18:46.480]  at a restaurant before you've seen the menu or
[01:18:46.480 --> 01:18:50.160]  ordered or it's like trying to put a car together before you know what the parts
[01:18:50.160 --> 01:18:53.280]  are grammar is the parts grammar is the research
[01:18:53.280 --> 01:18:57.600]  like right now i'm i'm holding up a stack of of papers from the council on
[01:18:57.600 --> 01:19:01.600]  foreign relations that i got directly from the council on foreign relations
[01:19:01.600 --> 01:19:04.640]  archives and this is the grammar that i've been doing
[01:19:04.640 --> 01:19:07.920]  or the research that i've been doing on the council on foreign relations and
[01:19:07.920 --> 01:19:11.680]  specific functions that that they're using or that they're
[01:19:11.680 --> 01:19:16.080]  manipulating and by the way the social engineers
[01:19:16.080 --> 01:19:21.120]  uh are our masters at their if their core writings generally have three meanings
[01:19:21.120 --> 01:19:24.320]  and uh they have a meetings for the general dumb down public
[01:19:24.320 --> 01:19:28.400]  they have meanings for the outer councils in their groups and they have the
[01:19:28.400 --> 01:19:31.760]  inner meanings and when you know how to read it it's all hidden
[01:19:31.760 --> 01:19:35.840]  they're in plain view an example of that is gary hart wrote a letter to iran
[01:19:35.840 --> 01:19:38.880]  publish it in the hovegan post saying we stage terror attacks
[01:19:38.880 --> 01:19:43.360]  we'll do it again just like 9 11 gulf atonkin you better do what we say
[01:19:43.360 --> 01:19:47.360]  but he wrote it it thinly veiled so when he was then confronted about it he
[01:19:47.360 --> 01:19:49.600]  first lied and said i never wrote that letter
[01:19:49.600 --> 01:19:52.160]  then when he was confronted with the letter he went ahead and met it okay
[01:19:52.160 --> 01:19:56.240]  that is what i said but it's almost like if you can't communicate with them
[01:19:56.240 --> 01:19:59.520]  and cut right to the chase with them they will lie to you but they have these
[01:19:59.520 --> 01:20:02.480]  weird rules that once you actually call them on it
[01:20:02.480 --> 01:20:06.400]  a lot of times they'll be honest it's a cult
[01:20:06.400 --> 01:20:09.360]  right and well you know see what we need to do
[01:20:09.360 --> 01:20:14.640]  alex is we need to to defeat our enemy we have to be able to break their
[01:20:14.640 --> 01:20:19.760]  ability to control us and in order to do that we have to
[01:20:19.760 --> 01:20:24.160]  take control basically of our own minds and leo tollstoy once said that the
[01:20:24.160 --> 01:20:27.840]  printing press was a mighty engine for disseminating ignorance
[01:20:27.840 --> 01:20:31.360]  and in other words what i'm getting at is that literacy
[01:20:31.360 --> 01:20:35.840]  in and of itself is a form of slavery until a systematic form of critical
[01:20:35.840 --> 01:20:39.600]  thinking is practice is practiced by the reader just being able
[01:20:39.600 --> 01:20:43.200]  to read just having literacy is not a way for people to
[01:20:43.200 --> 01:20:46.800]  learning to keep from being controlled that's how they control people
[01:20:46.800 --> 01:20:51.840]  the trick is learning a systematic method for thinking to filter through the
[01:20:51.840 --> 01:20:54.880]  information that's coming in via the five senses
[01:20:54.880 --> 01:21:00.640]  so that we're we don't get a virus and spread that virus to others as far as
[01:21:00.640 --> 01:21:02.960]  information let me give an example of a virus and see
[01:21:02.960 --> 01:21:06.560]  if you agree and then give the listeners a few other examples of this
[01:21:06.560 --> 01:21:12.800]  when obama comes out and says this is not a war in libya this is peace
[01:21:12.800 --> 01:21:17.760]  and it seems outrageous to you know have them do that or when the tsa sticks
[01:21:17.760 --> 01:21:20.400]  their hands down your pants or puts you in a microwave oven
[01:21:20.400 --> 01:21:25.440]  and says this is safety they mean to destroy logic they mean to condition
[01:21:25.440 --> 01:21:30.880]  you to accept their false reality and they're waging war against
[01:21:30.880 --> 01:21:34.160]  reality they live in reality the social engineers
[01:21:34.160 --> 01:21:38.880]  but they want us living in uh literally this matrix where they have implanted
[01:21:38.880 --> 01:21:42.400]  all this disinformation uh into our brains and so
[01:21:42.400 --> 01:21:46.480]  i would attack 9 11 and the fraud by saying governments have done this before
[01:21:46.480 --> 01:21:50.320]  this is why governments do it and then i would go through the impossibilities
[01:21:50.320 --> 01:21:54.800]  in the official story i would agree with that to to an extent but the first
[01:21:54.800 --> 01:21:58.720]  thing that we have to do alex especially with regarding 911 is we have to
[01:21:58.720 --> 01:22:01.440]  gather all of our data first and make sure that
[01:22:01.440 --> 01:22:05.360]  all of all of our data is gathered data and or grammar
[01:22:05.360 --> 01:22:09.680]  is also known as knowledge under the trivia okay and then logic
[01:22:09.680 --> 01:22:14.480]  is uh understanding so what we do first is we gather our data first
[01:22:14.480 --> 01:22:18.320]  we remove the contradictions from that data which becomes logic
[01:22:18.320 --> 01:22:22.080]  before we express that information to others which is
[01:22:22.080 --> 01:22:26.800]  rhetoric or wisdom uh edward renais to quote him real quick
[01:22:26.800 --> 01:22:30.400]  said that the conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organized habits and
[01:22:30.400 --> 01:22:33.360]  opinions of the masses is an important element in the
[01:22:33.360 --> 01:22:39.120]  in a democratic society those who manipulate this unseen mechanism of
[01:22:39.120 --> 01:22:42.560]  society constitute an invisible government which is the true
[01:22:42.560 --> 01:22:46.560]  ruling power of our country we are governed our minds molded our tastes
[01:22:46.560 --> 01:22:50.720]  formed our ideas suggested largely by men we have never heard of
[01:22:50.720 --> 01:22:54.400]  this is a logical result of the way in which our democratic society is
[01:22:54.400 --> 01:22:57.840]  organized in almost every act of our daily lives whether
[01:22:57.840 --> 01:23:02.080]  in the sphere of politics or business in our social conduct or ethical thinking
[01:23:02.080 --> 01:23:05.600]  we are dominated by the relatively small number of persons
[01:23:05.600 --> 01:23:09.520]  who understand the mental processes and social patterns of the masses
[01:23:09.520 --> 01:23:13.520]  it is they who pull the wires which control the public mind and that's from
[01:23:13.520 --> 01:23:18.880]  the very first paragraph of one from edward renais book propaganda
[01:23:18.880 --> 01:23:22.240]  that's correct and so you know what we're looking at is these
[01:23:22.240 --> 01:23:26.800]  elites use sophism they use the trivium against us and the way
[01:23:26.800 --> 01:23:30.480]  to fight the trivium being used against us
[01:23:30.480 --> 01:23:35.200]  is to learn the trivium see what they've done is they removed the classical
[01:23:35.200 --> 01:23:39.920]  seven liberal arts from our education the word liberal in and of itself
[01:23:39.920 --> 01:23:43.440]  alex comes from the latin liber which means book
[01:23:43.440 --> 01:23:48.560]  and in ancient roman times the slaves were not allowed to study the seven
[01:23:48.560 --> 01:23:53.920]  liberal arts of the liberal means learned or books
[01:23:53.920 --> 01:23:58.320]  right and what exactly and and so the the people once they were
[01:23:58.320 --> 01:24:03.600]  once you became freed from slavery under roman in roman times the first thing
[01:24:03.600 --> 01:24:07.280]  you did was undertook a study of the trivium and quadrivium
[01:24:07.280 --> 01:24:11.200]  okay so this is why book or liber and liberty
[01:24:11.200 --> 01:24:16.000]  are synonymous freedom means book okay so people have to understand that their
[01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:19.760]  freedom is in the books it's in the trivium and the quadrivium
[01:24:19.760 --> 01:24:23.440]  again the trivium is grammar logic and rhetoric always in that order
[01:24:23.440 --> 01:24:27.760]  that and if they if you're given it if it's given to you out of order if logic
[01:24:27.760 --> 01:24:31.600]  is put first for instance that in and of itself is a system of mind and that's
[01:24:31.600 --> 01:24:35.600]  why we see people who will seriously you know you say i don't want government
[01:24:35.600 --> 01:24:38.720]  run health care and they say you don't like black
[01:24:38.720 --> 01:24:41.920]  people and for us well that's that's what they're doing is that's a red
[01:24:41.920 --> 01:24:44.960]  herring right there they they're diverting the subject
[01:24:44.960 --> 01:24:48.880]  no no but for those of us that that can you have basic common sense and
[01:24:48.880 --> 01:24:52.640]  historical understanding we see it as an asinine
[01:24:52.640 --> 01:24:57.360]  actual form of racism creating division but we don't understand they're hitting
[01:24:57.360 --> 01:25:00.800]  an audience that is so confused that they just
[01:25:00.800 --> 01:25:04.320]  believe the symbol of the spoken word makes it so
[01:25:04.320 --> 01:25:08.160]  and so they're primed to accept lies and have no discrimination
[01:25:08.160 --> 01:25:12.480]  to be able to uh calculate uh information
[01:25:12.480 --> 01:25:16.800]  i would agree with that but let's put aside what would what we would generally
[01:25:16.800 --> 01:25:22.480]  consider a common idea of of of critical thinking
[01:25:22.480 --> 01:25:26.800]  okay because see to the elites unless you have studied the trivium and
[01:25:26.800 --> 01:25:31.040]  quadrivium and you understand and can identify logical fallacies
[01:25:31.040 --> 01:25:35.440]  both formal and form informal they don't consider that you have
[01:25:35.440 --> 01:25:39.920]  any system of critical thinking in fact those who don't have the trivium
[01:25:39.920 --> 01:25:43.680]  are very easily mind controlled so what we've been doing is we've been putting
[01:25:43.680 --> 01:25:46.560]  this information out to people to empower them
[01:25:46.560 --> 01:25:51.040]  so it's basically like taking the red pill in the matrix once you have
[01:25:51.040 --> 01:25:54.960]  the trivium you can see all of the logical fallacies that
[01:25:54.960 --> 01:25:58.320]  that they use against you and in fact i launched a
[01:25:58.320 --> 01:26:02.240]  a website recently called popupfallacies.com
[01:26:02.240 --> 01:26:05.920]  and i had the second video that i put up there was
[01:26:05.920 --> 01:26:11.040]  obama's uh the death of osama bin laden video and obama has a lie per minute
[01:26:11.040 --> 01:26:17.200]  rating of 9.5 lies per minute and when you can actually see the fallacies
[01:26:17.200 --> 01:26:21.040]  coming at you during these presidential political speeches etc
[01:26:21.040 --> 01:26:25.120]  you can you can begin to realize how to apply this information right away so
[01:26:25.120 --> 01:26:29.040]  what we have to do alex we have to get people to understand the logical
[01:26:29.040 --> 01:26:32.480]  fallacies on a global basis right away well here's a
[01:26:32.480 --> 01:26:37.520]  logical fallacy stop these people absolutely but here's a logical fallacy
[01:26:37.520 --> 01:26:43.520]  um i mean on the face of it if government
[01:26:43.520 --> 01:26:46.960]  is almost always lying or spinning why do we then
[01:26:46.960 --> 01:26:50.480]  believe the next thing they tell us and why do they use this
[01:26:50.480 --> 01:26:54.320]  mind control term of conspiracy theorists when we don't believe people
[01:26:54.320 --> 01:26:59.280]  that are certified liars that right there is a blatant well a conspiracy
[01:26:59.280 --> 01:27:02.800]  theorist labeling somebody a conspiracy theorist as an ad hominem
[01:27:02.800 --> 01:27:07.200]  yes it's it's to get them to stop focusing on what you're saying alex
[01:27:07.200 --> 01:27:11.840]  and to say oh alex is a conspiracy theorist it's an appeal to ridicule
[01:27:11.840 --> 01:27:15.360]  right so instead of saying that instead of dealing with them they have the appeal
[01:27:15.360 --> 01:27:18.080]  to authority and then they have the appeal to authority
[01:27:18.080 --> 01:27:22.160]  well you can use that too but see you know an appeal to authority is any
[01:27:22.160 --> 01:27:25.840]  appeal when you're using an expert to solidify a point
[01:27:25.840 --> 01:27:30.000]  but you know what you have to show that that expert is an authority and that
[01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:32.880]  their integrity is not under question but an
[01:27:32.880 --> 01:27:36.560]  appeal to ridicule let's say that they are just say oh alex jones is a
[01:27:36.560 --> 01:27:40.480]  conspiracy theorist what that is is it's an ad hominem
[01:27:40.480 --> 01:27:43.440]  attack or an attack on the man they're not dealing with the specific
[01:27:43.440 --> 01:27:46.960]  information that you're dealing with or presenting but it's also an appeal to
[01:27:46.960 --> 01:27:50.960]  ridicule which is basically like saying alex jones is wrong because
[01:27:50.960 --> 01:28:00.240]  ha ha ha you there uh yes i am uh uh mr urban say that again
[01:28:00.240 --> 01:28:05.840]  i was saying that an appeal to ridicule is like saying alex jones is wrong
[01:28:05.840 --> 01:28:12.960]  because ha ha ha yes okay and and so these are the logical fallacies and
[01:28:12.960 --> 01:28:16.720]  there's about 22 of the most common logical fallacies there's probably a
[01:28:16.720 --> 01:28:19.200]  couple hundred in total if people want to go to the
[01:28:19.200 --> 01:28:23.120]  triviumeducation.com website once again trivium
[01:28:23.120 --> 01:28:29.600]  tr i v i u m education.com uh they can begin their study of the
[01:28:29.600 --> 01:28:32.960]  trivium and this information right there on the website and if also if
[01:28:32.960 --> 01:28:37.200]  people want to get involved in in uh study groups i recommend that they go
[01:28:37.200 --> 01:28:41.520]  to uh richard andrew groves tragedy and hope.com
[01:28:41.520 --> 01:28:45.360]  website which is obviously named after professor carol quigley's
[01:28:45.360 --> 01:28:50.080]  book uh so you know what we're trying to do is create a meme
[01:28:50.080 --> 01:28:53.600]  of giving this information back to people the skills of critical thinking
[01:28:53.600 --> 01:28:57.920]  the classical seven liberal arts because you cannot be free
[01:28:57.920 --> 01:29:01.920]  unless you have these tools in fact the the american rebellion against
[01:29:01.920 --> 01:29:05.600]  england on the canada free press website this
[01:29:05.600 --> 01:29:08.320]  author kelly i forget her last name the other day
[01:29:08.320 --> 01:29:12.320]  for fourth of july she published an article right on this website that said
[01:29:12.320 --> 01:29:16.080]  that the american revolution was based around the trivium
[01:29:16.080 --> 01:29:19.040]  and people knowing how to think knowing how to
[01:29:19.040 --> 01:29:22.720]  slice through these lies and get to the truth either that or to know
[01:29:22.720 --> 01:29:27.120]  what needs more research to derive at that truth it is essential
[01:29:27.120 --> 01:29:33.920]  so you know it's uh it is a a big issue you know censorship in and of itself
[01:29:33.920 --> 01:29:37.600]  there's censorship or secrecy secrecy is occulting
[01:29:37.600 --> 01:29:43.120]  information yes it is occult hidden uh yon ervin uh is our guest i'm alex

[01:33:18.400 --> 01:33:25.120]  yon ervin is our guest and he's attempting to get people to go back to
[01:33:25.120 --> 01:33:29.520]  classical education you know going back to the Greeks the Romans
[01:33:29.520 --> 01:33:32.880]  common sense what made western civilization great
[01:33:32.880 --> 01:33:36.000]  that's not taught now it's all about being a nanny
[01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:39.440]  being obsessed with your quote sexual or racial identity
[01:33:39.440 --> 01:33:43.680]  fighting with everyone around you knowing all the mindless trivia
[01:33:43.680 --> 01:33:49.280]  of the different ball games and and you know the latest trial on television
[01:33:49.280 --> 01:33:53.440]  but not understanding how human cultures operate not understanding
[01:33:53.440 --> 01:33:58.160]  history not understanding i mean they've convinced the the planet
[01:33:58.160 --> 01:34:01.760]  to a great extent that powerful people don't meet in secret
[01:34:01.760 --> 01:34:06.160]  and don't have agendas and aren't dangerous total common sense for all
[01:34:06.160 --> 01:34:10.240]  of civilization uh they have taught people
[01:34:10.240 --> 01:34:15.200]  how to instinctively now engage in their own fallacies their own delusions
[01:34:15.200 --> 01:34:18.320]  it's creating a delusional society i just put it
[01:34:18.320 --> 01:34:22.480]  uh in in in layman's terms of course decades ago i did
[01:34:22.480 --> 01:34:26.320]  you know read over some of the classical uh literature and
[01:34:26.320 --> 01:34:29.040]  thought processes but it's all there self-evident
[01:34:29.040 --> 01:34:34.400]  but what's good about what uh yon's doing is he's technically bringing it back
[01:34:34.400 --> 01:34:39.520]  and and showing people uh how it's being used against him now so
[01:34:39.520 --> 01:34:44.000]  this is a long segment uh yon i want to give you the floor now
[01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:47.760]  as if you're talking to a completely new audience and i would imagine 90% of my
[01:34:47.760 --> 01:34:50.560]  audience on you know all these am and fm stations have
[01:34:50.560 --> 01:34:53.520]  never heard of you and and they're intelligent folks they know they're
[01:34:53.520 --> 01:34:56.560]  being lied to and manipulated they know their neighbors
[01:34:56.560 --> 01:34:59.840]  uh just seem like they're complete idiots i mean they can sell insurance
[01:34:59.840 --> 01:35:02.560]  they can be doctors they can be lawyers but still
[01:35:02.560 --> 01:35:05.440]  they will giggle and laugh at common sense because
[01:35:05.440 --> 01:35:09.040]  they believe common sense is being a chump not having
[01:35:09.040 --> 01:35:13.120]  uh a large lexicon the system is limiting words now
[01:35:13.120 --> 01:35:15.840]  destroying words changing their meeting that's it
[01:35:15.840 --> 01:35:19.360]  that's the systematic method of dumbing us down i know you interviewed
[01:35:19.360 --> 01:35:24.480]  charlotte iserbeet last year uh she wrote the book uh the dumbing down of america
[01:35:24.480 --> 01:35:28.080]  you know this is the the key stuff that they're using they want people to sit
[01:35:28.080 --> 01:35:31.840]  there and instead of writing laughing out loud they go lol
[01:35:31.840 --> 01:35:36.720]  right you know or all of these other abbreviations that people are using in
[01:35:36.720 --> 01:35:40.160]  text and everything else that is literally dumbing us down it's like
[01:35:40.160 --> 01:35:43.440]  animal calls so so listen i'm gonna give you the floor
[01:35:43.440 --> 01:35:48.560]  but but but explain the basics of it for a start over go through it
[01:35:48.560 --> 01:35:51.440]  break down what television all of it's doing to us
[01:35:51.440 --> 01:35:55.040]  well television in and of itself with how to systematic method
[01:35:55.040 --> 01:35:58.720]  of seeing through the lies coming out to you it's it is
[01:35:58.720 --> 01:36:03.120]  it's television programming and that programming is programming you
[01:36:03.120 --> 01:36:06.800]  it's not programming a machine the machine is just a receiver
[01:36:06.800 --> 01:36:10.240]  but the program is to program you you're the one that can
[01:36:10.240 --> 01:36:12.960]  that can take a program just like a computer can
[01:36:12.960 --> 01:36:16.720]  but uh what i want to do real quick is explain to people a little bit more
[01:36:16.720 --> 01:36:19.840]  clearly exactly what the trivium is
[01:36:19.840 --> 01:36:23.840]  okay so i already said that the the trivium is grammar logic and rhetoric
[01:36:23.840 --> 01:36:28.320]  but the trivery the trivium or grammar the grammar aspect of the trivium
[01:36:28.320 --> 01:36:32.400]  answers the question of who what where and when of a subject
[01:36:32.400 --> 01:36:38.240]  diverting and ordering facts of reality comprises basic systematic
[01:36:38.240 --> 01:36:42.720]  knowledge and not only the rules and development applied to the ordering of
[01:36:42.720 --> 01:36:46.800]  word comes concepts for for verbal expression and communication
[01:36:46.800 --> 01:36:50.960]  but for our first contact with conscious order as such
[01:36:50.960 --> 01:36:55.840]  and then logic answers the why of a subject developing the faculty of reason
[01:36:55.840 --> 01:36:59.840]  in establishing valid i.e. non-contradictory relationships among
[01:36:59.840 --> 01:37:04.320]  facts yields basic systematic understanding so again
[01:37:04.320 --> 01:37:07.680]  grammar was knowledge logic is understanding and then
[01:37:07.680 --> 01:37:12.000]  rhetoric provides the how of a subject and it applies knowledge and
[01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:17.680]  understanding expressively and comprises wisdom in
[01:37:17.680 --> 01:37:22.320]  other words it is a systematically usable form of knowledge and
[01:37:22.320 --> 01:37:25.120]  understanding put together that you express to others so
[01:37:25.120 --> 01:37:29.680]  let's say that you have a bunch of let's say that you have a model airplane
[01:37:29.680 --> 01:37:32.480]  that you want to put together and you have all these parts lying around okay
[01:37:32.480 --> 01:37:35.600]  that's the grammar though all those parts lying around to the grammar
[01:37:35.600 --> 01:37:40.400]  grammar should not be understood as just words and letters and punctuation
[01:37:40.400 --> 01:37:44.800]  grammar should be understood as the the items that make up reality the trees
[01:37:44.800 --> 01:37:48.160]  the cars the parts everything in front of you out in reality your computer
[01:37:48.160 --> 01:37:51.280]  your keyboard your the glass of water sitting in front of you
[01:37:51.280 --> 01:37:55.280]  that's the grammar aspect of your reality and so
[01:37:55.280 --> 01:37:58.960]  when we when we're looking at the the parts of this model airplane we say
[01:37:58.960 --> 01:38:02.400]  okay we have to have knowledge of these parts before we can put them together
[01:38:02.400 --> 01:38:05.120]  otherwise we're not going to end up with a model airplane we're going to end up
[01:38:05.120 --> 01:38:08.720]  with a lump of plastic or whatever it is but
[01:38:08.720 --> 01:38:11.760]  by having knowledge first of those parts
[01:38:11.760 --> 01:38:16.400]  then we remove the contradictions and we put those parts together that forms
[01:38:16.400 --> 01:38:19.440]  language or that puts the model airplane together
[01:38:19.440 --> 01:38:22.640]  as a whole model airplane with that with the contradictions
[01:38:22.640 --> 01:38:27.120]  removed from it and then when we go to someone else and express that
[01:38:27.120 --> 01:38:30.880]  to someone else that is rhetoric or wisdom okay
[01:38:30.880 --> 01:38:35.680]  so if we take any of these things out of order the entire system collapses
[01:38:35.680 --> 01:38:38.960]  and this is what the elites use on the masses
[01:38:38.960 --> 01:38:44.000]  to control them uh so you know even albert pike and morals and dogma in on
[01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:51.520]  page uh i think it's uh 866 or 869 uh 861 excuse me proclaims that the royal
[01:38:51.520 --> 01:38:54.480]  secret of the sublime prince is found in the understanding of the
[01:38:54.480 --> 01:38:58.080]  Pythagorean five three four right angle triangle the five
[01:38:58.080 --> 01:39:00.560]  represents the five senses the three represents the
[01:39:00.560 --> 01:39:02.960]  trivium grammar logic and rhetoric and the four
[01:39:02.960 --> 01:39:07.360]  represents the quadrivium which is math geometry music and astronomy
[01:39:07.360 --> 01:39:11.040]  and i should state that the quadrivium always has to be in that order
[01:39:11.040 --> 01:39:14.880]  math is number in itself geometry is number in space
[01:39:14.880 --> 01:39:21.520]  music or harmony is number in time and astronomy is number in space and time
[01:39:21.520 --> 01:39:25.120]  and in my own instance when i was in junior high school
[01:39:25.120 --> 01:39:31.520]  they took the the geometry and they taught me algebra before geometry which
[01:39:31.520 --> 01:39:34.480]  takes it out of order you have to learn math geometry
[01:39:34.480 --> 01:39:40.160]  then uh go on to algebra and these calculus these other forms of
[01:39:40.160 --> 01:39:44.720]  mathematics so they intentionally dumb us down and confuse us by taking these
[01:39:44.720 --> 01:39:48.320]  ancient systems out of order the trivium and quadrivium see the
[01:39:48.320 --> 01:39:53.920]  ancients figured out over 2000 years ago 2500 years ago exactly how the human
[01:39:53.920 --> 01:39:57.840]  mind works and processes information the elitists have kept this
[01:39:57.840 --> 01:40:01.520]  information to themselves and that's how they control the masses
[01:40:01.520 --> 01:40:04.960]  by them understanding who what where and when
[01:40:04.960 --> 01:40:08.560]  and understanding the logical fallacies and what they'll do is they'll use a
[01:40:08.560 --> 01:40:11.680]  you know appeal to belief uh they'll use circular
[01:40:11.680 --> 01:40:15.840]  circular logic appeal to fear you know and just to jab at you a little bit
[01:40:15.840 --> 01:40:19.920]  alex i know a lot of times you get criticized for using too much
[01:40:19.920 --> 01:40:25.760]  appeal to fear in your show so by by understanding how these appeal to
[01:40:25.760 --> 01:40:29.600]  fallacies are used and manipulated against us we can take those out of our
[01:40:29.600 --> 01:40:36.400]  own thinking and then deliver a a coherent directed
[01:40:36.400 --> 01:40:40.480]  bit of information towards our audience that is going to empower them
[01:40:40.480 --> 01:40:44.400]  and enlighten them and give them the tools necessary
[01:40:44.400 --> 01:40:49.360]  so that we can stop this insane madness that's going on in the world around us
[01:40:49.360 --> 01:40:52.880]  this new world order and folks the new world order is very real the
[01:40:52.880 --> 01:40:56.960]  perceptibility so the illuminati is real and uh
[01:40:56.960 --> 01:41:00.800]  the you know in my personal opinion i very strongly believe that the
[01:41:00.800 --> 01:41:03.920]  religions themselves are also a part of the new world order
[01:41:03.920 --> 01:41:07.360]  and the religions themselves get control people by their
[01:41:07.360 --> 01:41:11.760]  fear of sins in an afterlife rather than having to use direct physical force
[01:41:11.760 --> 01:41:16.640]  against you now well
[01:41:17.920 --> 01:41:20.880]  i mean i want to continue to give you the floor here because if i start
[01:41:20.880 --> 01:41:24.480]  if i start right i mean if i start interjecting questions
[01:41:24.480 --> 01:41:26.880]  then you're not going to be able to really put these ideas out and i know
[01:41:26.880 --> 01:41:30.880]  you're correct i mean i've read the the you know the classic literature i i
[01:41:30.880 --> 01:41:33.680]  know that that's why the globalist call themselves
[01:41:33.680 --> 01:41:37.680]  uh the uh a cult because that simply means
[01:41:37.680 --> 01:41:42.080]  hidden hidden and it's all a big uh see the only the only the only way that
[01:41:42.080 --> 01:41:45.520]  they can control us is to hide information or to occult information
[01:41:45.520 --> 01:41:48.800]  whether it's religious information political information or whatever
[01:41:48.800 --> 01:41:53.120]  whoever is occulting or has possession of that information and is not sharing it
[01:41:53.120 --> 01:41:56.880]  they have power over that other person so that is the whole trick and
[01:41:56.880 --> 01:42:01.040]  education in and of itself is the unocculting of information as i
[01:42:01.040 --> 01:42:04.240]  believe it was uh john johnson's dictionary and
[01:42:04.240 --> 01:42:11.120]  some somewhere around 1851 defined it so uh you know it is the the occult
[01:42:11.120 --> 01:42:15.520]  people need to study the occult and unoccult it it's
[01:42:15.520 --> 01:42:20.240]  it's having it a cult that makes it a tool that can be used against you and
[01:42:20.240 --> 01:42:23.600]  it's your fear of understanding that tool
[01:42:23.600 --> 01:42:26.720]  that enables it to be used against you so when people
[01:42:26.720 --> 01:42:30.800]  fear the cabala when people fear the classical seven liberal arts when
[01:42:30.800 --> 01:42:35.840]  people fear studying things it works to their own detriment
[01:42:35.840 --> 01:42:38.880]  because this is how it is specifically used against them
[01:42:38.880 --> 01:42:43.200]  well expanding on that i mean i certainly know that organized religion
[01:42:43.200 --> 01:42:47.440]  is used to control people now individuals own spiritual journey
[01:42:47.440 --> 01:42:50.000]  you know that's just a window into the wider universe
[01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:55.040]  uh and you know the other dimensions but there's no doubt it's being used but
[01:42:55.040 --> 01:42:59.200]  so well it's like it's like psychedelics you know psychedelics are just a tool
[01:42:59.200 --> 01:43:03.120]  it's like a knife okay you can stab somebody with a knife or you can
[01:43:03.120 --> 01:43:06.240]  cut your steak with it it's not good or bad but what happens
[01:43:06.240 --> 01:43:09.600]  is that you know these religions throughout history shamanic cultures
[01:43:09.600 --> 01:43:12.960]  throughout history have used psychedelics for religious practices but
[01:43:12.960 --> 01:43:15.200]  what happens is you get these elite groups
[01:43:15.200 --> 01:43:18.560]  that have the knowledge of the trivium and quadrivium and recognize
[01:43:18.560 --> 01:43:21.600]  that if they can shock people loose from other paradigms
[01:43:21.600 --> 01:43:25.040]  and then give them false information when they've been freed through the
[01:43:25.040 --> 01:43:28.080]  psychedelic experience if they can take that moment when
[01:43:28.080 --> 01:43:31.680]  they're free and and interject their own wrong information
[01:43:31.680 --> 01:43:35.280]  then they can control people so the trick is to give people
[01:43:35.280 --> 01:43:39.280]  you know before my recommendation i don't speak against psychedelics at all
[01:43:39.280 --> 01:43:43.280]  my recommendation is that people study logic take a course in logic especially
[01:43:43.280 --> 01:43:46.400]  in the trivium and quadrivium before they use these things but what i want to
[01:43:46.400 --> 01:43:50.400]  do is i want to go into some of the logical fallacies real quick because
[01:43:50.400 --> 01:43:53.440]  you know we've only got 15 minutes left but what i want to do is
[01:43:53.440 --> 01:43:58.400]  give people the tools to begin to apply this stuff right away by the end of
[01:43:58.400 --> 01:44:01.520]  this interview so we already mentioned ad hominem
[01:44:01.520 --> 01:44:04.880]  attack and uh there's there's a couple of different
[01:44:04.880 --> 01:44:08.800]  forms of ad hominem there's a circle circumstantial ad hominem which means
[01:44:08.800 --> 01:44:12.960]  like uh i own a bookstore i'm promoting a certain
[01:44:12.960 --> 01:44:17.280]  new law in the county and uh you know somebody will come along and says well
[01:44:17.280 --> 01:44:21.040]  that person owns a bookstore so therefore anything they say is invalid
[01:44:21.040 --> 01:44:24.560]  that's a circumstantial ad hominem there's appeal to emotion
[01:44:24.560 --> 01:44:28.320]  which most people can figure out what that is appeal to fear
[01:44:28.320 --> 01:44:32.080]  appeal to flattery your boss at work probably likes to use that well not you
[01:44:32.080 --> 01:44:35.120]  but you're the boss but uh you know those who go to work on
[01:44:35.120 --> 01:44:39.520]  monday they walk into the workplace and the boss says you know jane that's a
[01:44:39.520 --> 01:44:43.200]  mighty nice new dress that you have on today and did you get your haircut
[01:44:43.200 --> 01:44:46.480]  well you look like you're ready to do a fine job today
[01:44:46.480 --> 01:44:50.000]  and so there's also appeal to novelty appeal to pity
[01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:53.280]  appeal to popularity you know alex if you do this
[01:44:53.280 --> 01:44:57.760]  you're going to be popular with everyone or alex if you buy this new fancy car
[01:44:57.760 --> 01:45:00.320]  you're going to have all the girls or if you drink this
[01:45:00.320 --> 01:45:04.560]  this beer uh with all these pretty girls with blue eyes alex you're going to
[01:45:04.560 --> 01:45:08.720]  have all the pretty girls around you or appeal to tradition which is
[01:45:08.720 --> 01:45:12.400]  basically appeal to let's say well in our country
[01:45:12.400 --> 01:45:16.000]  we've always had slavery and so therefore slavery is right you know that's an
[01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:20.000]  appeal to tradition or uh but we've always believed in
[01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:23.280]  christianity and christianity is this that's an appeal to
[01:45:23.280 --> 01:45:29.280]  tradition excuse me tradition um begging the question is circular logic
[01:45:29.280 --> 01:45:32.480]  it's it's when somebody presents an argument let's say
[01:45:32.480 --> 01:45:37.120]  i argue that some aspect of let's say i claim that
[01:45:37.120 --> 01:45:41.040]  that god wrote the bible okay and then somebody comes along and says
[01:45:41.040 --> 01:45:44.080]  well how do you know that's true and i say well it says so right here in the
[01:45:44.080 --> 01:45:48.240]  bible that in and of itself is begging the question you're using
[01:45:48.240 --> 01:45:51.760]  the same source that you got that information from to back your source so
[01:45:51.760 --> 01:45:56.560]  that's a logical fallacy in and of itself now you have to judge the bible
[01:45:56.560 --> 01:46:01.360]  off of the information and are the things that it talked about
[01:46:01.360 --> 01:46:04.720]  and logical fallacies as well you've got to remember that
[01:46:04.720 --> 01:46:07.680]  you know the lot see here's the thing you know that you're going to claim that's
[01:46:07.680 --> 01:46:11.200]  like a quad train with nasser domeson and and in the world there's always
[01:46:11.200 --> 01:46:13.680]  going to be similar things happening or people predict
[01:46:13.680 --> 01:46:18.160]  see there's there's things that we can go out into reality and recognize that
[01:46:18.160 --> 01:46:22.160]  are created from if you want to call it god or guy or the great spirit whatever
[01:46:22.160 --> 01:46:25.680]  you want to call it so let's say we see a tree we know that tree came came
[01:46:25.680 --> 01:46:29.680]  came from the great spirit or we see a brick wall or we see a computer or a
[01:46:29.680 --> 01:46:33.200]  window or a house we know that these things are what man create we see a dog
[01:46:33.200 --> 01:46:37.360]  or a cat or a bird we know that those are things that god created well
[01:46:37.360 --> 01:46:41.440]  do do books come from gods or do they come from
[01:46:41.440 --> 01:46:45.760]  man so if we use simple common logic we can identify that the bible
[01:46:45.760 --> 01:46:50.240]  is a book and books are created by men it's really simple logic when we put it
[01:46:50.240 --> 01:46:53.360]  well i'm not trying to argue with you about that because i think it's
[01:46:53.360 --> 01:46:56.960]  important to spur thought and to get people outside the box
[01:46:56.960 --> 01:47:02.720]  but specifically the main continuum of christianity says the bible
[01:47:02.720 --> 01:47:07.040]  is inspired by god so so it's not people aren't
[01:47:07.040 --> 01:47:11.120]  saying that god physically sat down with a typical
[01:47:11.120 --> 01:47:14.480]  interpretation is that the bible is the official word of god
[01:47:14.480 --> 01:47:18.640]  uncorrupted so you know but many men in fact you had
[01:47:18.640 --> 01:47:21.760]  you know but let me raise this point i mean to you because again there's always
[01:47:21.760 --> 01:47:24.000]  complex let me know i don't want to get off into a
[01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:30.960]  debate about this my only issue here is that i see the system
[01:47:30.960 --> 01:47:37.200]  attacking not organized christianity but but attacking actually you know what
[01:47:37.200 --> 01:47:41.440]  christ taught and so when i see the system attacking something
[01:47:41.440 --> 01:47:44.320]  and it is good to do and others as you'd have them do under you and things like
[01:47:44.320 --> 01:47:47.280]  that then that makes me wonder because there's this
[01:47:47.280 --> 01:47:52.240]  giant universe of things to talk about and i wonder why people always
[01:47:52.240 --> 01:47:55.600]  obsess on christianity i mean if it's such
[01:47:55.600 --> 01:47:59.520]  hogwash well you can get into zionism or any of these different
[01:47:59.520 --> 01:48:02.800]  subjects as well so we have to be careful with all of these things really
[01:48:02.800 --> 01:48:06.560]  but really the thing is is to not get caught up into your emotions
[01:48:06.560 --> 01:48:11.280]  and to look at these things in an analytical fashion so that you can come
[01:48:11.280 --> 01:48:17.040]  to a a systematic a method of driving certainty
[01:48:17.040 --> 01:48:21.360]  and not use your emotions or anything else getting caught up in there
[01:48:21.360 --> 01:48:25.680]  now i understand i want to i want to pull back here for just a moment
[01:48:25.680 --> 01:48:28.400]  and we'll keep you a little bit in the next hour so you have more time if you
[01:48:28.400 --> 01:48:31.600]  can do it before i get to some other news here
[01:48:31.600 --> 01:48:35.840]  but but just watching what the social engineers are doing
[01:48:35.840 --> 01:48:39.280]  it it's clear now that they're trying to
[01:48:39.280 --> 01:48:46.400]  overly lie and and basically just train us to accept total la la land
[01:48:46.400 --> 01:48:51.440]  and that there's a real attempt right now to more than ever blur
[01:48:51.440 --> 01:48:56.560]  reality uh you know from fiction uh uh
[01:48:56.560 --> 01:49:00.960]  a do you agree with that statement and b what is the method to the social
[01:49:00.960 --> 01:49:03.840]  engineers madness
[01:49:06.160 --> 01:49:09.920]  you're asking me i mean i'm asking i mean i'm asking do you agree
[01:49:09.920 --> 01:49:13.920]  that they're really turning up the heat right now oh yeah we'll see right now
[01:49:13.920 --> 01:49:17.440]  they're in a panic because people are waking up and they're figuring out how
[01:49:17.440 --> 01:49:20.720]  the whole system works so they're trying to put as much pressure on us as
[01:49:20.720 --> 01:49:23.040]  possible they're trying to keep all you know
[01:49:23.040 --> 01:49:26.880]  all the the rats inside the skinner box and all of the rats are starting to
[01:49:26.880 --> 01:49:30.800]  break loose and going you know forget this whole skinner box thing i don't
[01:49:30.800 --> 01:49:33.280]  want to be in the skinner box i don't want to be
[01:49:33.280 --> 01:49:37.600]  your your little rat for your mind control gimmick and that's why i want to
[01:49:37.600 --> 01:49:40.880]  get you on i wanted to get you on about mind control about tv
[01:49:40.880 --> 01:49:44.640]  about the rat studies and the trivia the trivia and all of this stuff that we're
[01:49:44.640 --> 01:49:49.200]  going into is how is the core foundation of how they use mind control
[01:49:49.200 --> 01:49:53.440]  so that's why i need to cover that information first no no i understand
[01:49:53.440 --> 01:49:57.760]  that that people aren't being given basic building blocks of
[01:49:57.760 --> 01:50:01.040]  of thought discernment reality testing i understand so
[01:50:01.040 --> 01:50:04.560]  how about you stay 50 or like 10 minutes with us in the next hour it's only a
[01:50:04.560 --> 01:50:06.560]  few short segments if you want to go in if you want to go
[01:50:06.560 --> 01:50:10.640]  longer than that too but what we have to realize is that fallacies are errors and
[01:50:10.640 --> 01:50:14.160]  thinking and and that is the first thing that we have to deal with
[01:50:14.160 --> 01:50:18.800]  yes i understand that because from that stems other deceptions once you've
[01:50:18.800 --> 01:50:22.080]  been taught how to just accept things that you're
[01:50:22.080 --> 01:50:25.600]  told because the person's wearing a nice suit is on television
[01:50:25.600 --> 01:50:28.960]  then the sky's the limit people got to be more skeptical
[01:50:28.960 --> 01:50:32.480]  instead of a liberal education what they're giving people today is a
[01:50:32.480 --> 01:50:37.120]  servile or a servitude education to get people to be good factory workers
[01:50:37.120 --> 01:50:40.800]  good soldiers not think critically not question what you're told
[01:50:40.800 --> 01:50:44.160]  just follow along be spoon fed the information that you're fed
[01:50:44.160 --> 01:50:47.280]  by the mainstream and by the way you're not just saying that we have the
[01:50:47.280 --> 01:50:51.840]  department of education documents and others we have the stuff from germany
[01:50:51.840 --> 01:50:54.880]  going back over a hundred years ago where they said they would do this
[01:50:54.880 --> 01:50:58.880]  it's called kindergarten folks not critical thinking but regurgitating

[01:56:22.880 --> 01:56:31.840]  now going back to our guest uh yon uh let me let's say you had three minutes on
[01:56:31.840 --> 01:56:35.200]  national television to talk to the sheep what would you say you know you're in a
[01:56:35.200 --> 01:56:37.440]  false reality you've been programmed the words
[01:56:37.440 --> 01:56:40.640]  you're using aren't real break out of your trance i mean i found
[01:56:40.640 --> 01:56:43.600]  that because they don't have the rhetoric they don't have the basic
[01:56:43.600 --> 01:56:46.400]  classical education they don't have any of this stuff
[01:56:46.400 --> 01:56:50.240]  that that that that it's like telling somebody to swim who's never even
[01:56:50.240 --> 01:56:54.880]  been in the in the in the baby pool i just say hey you better look around you
[01:56:54.880 --> 01:56:59.120]  you eventually people have to take the first step and hold the rail and step
[01:56:59.120 --> 01:57:03.440]  into the baby pool right and uh that's the first step to learning how to swim
[01:57:03.440 --> 01:57:07.920]  you know you have to you have to get wet and uh so people have to pick up the
[01:57:07.920 --> 01:57:10.160]  books they have to start learning this stuff
[01:57:10.160 --> 01:57:14.080]  or we're all going to continue to be slaves the broken trivium
[01:57:14.080 --> 01:57:19.040]  equals mind control the fixed trivium equals liberation so it's really up to
[01:57:19.040 --> 01:57:23.680]  you know the audience out there to uh to break free of these systems of mind
[01:57:23.680 --> 01:57:26.800]  control and figure out how they work and to get
[01:57:26.800 --> 01:57:30.560]  educated it's very important that we fix our education that we study charlotte
[01:57:30.560 --> 01:57:33.440]  iserbeet john taylor gato and these people that are
[01:57:33.440 --> 01:57:38.320]  that are giving us the real tools about the education system and how it's been
[01:57:38.320 --> 01:57:43.120]  corrupted as well as brett venot school sucks podcast out there
[01:57:43.120 --> 01:57:49.360]  that is a top notch publication and the the education system in and of itself
[01:57:49.360 --> 01:57:54.320]  is the core foundation of the mind control with the trivium and quadrivium in
[01:57:54.320 --> 01:57:57.680]  that and then everything stems from there the political system
[01:57:57.680 --> 01:58:02.640]  the the pr the marketing companies uh none of that stuff would work you wouldn't
[01:58:02.640 --> 01:58:06.640]  have commercials for for for that matter alex maybe this is
[01:58:06.640 --> 01:58:10.160]  against your own uh self-interest but if people had the trivium and
[01:58:10.160 --> 01:58:13.920]  quadrivium you wouldn't have commercials the way they are right now with all of
[01:58:13.920 --> 01:58:18.320]  you know if you sit there and listen through an average 30 second commercial
[01:58:18.320 --> 01:58:22.560]  most commercials will run the full gambit of logical fallacies in that short
[01:58:22.560 --> 01:58:26.480]  time yeah well that's my point is though we
[01:58:26.480 --> 01:58:30.240]  have lived in this system so long that most people
[01:58:30.240 --> 01:58:33.840]  writing commercials aren't even aware of it it it it's just the culture of
[01:58:33.840 --> 01:58:37.440]  communication that's why any sponsors i promote it's
[01:58:37.440 --> 01:58:42.320]  something i use and i endorse we'll be right back
[01:58:42.320 --> 01:58:50.720]  you are listening to gcn visit gcnlive.com today
[01:58:50.720 --> 01:58:53.920]  this is alex jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a
[01:58:53.920 --> 01:58:57.360]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation
[01:58:57.360 --> 01:58:59.600]  could easily double or triple your electric bill
[01:58:59.600 --> 01:59:03.840]  number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric
[01:59:03.840 --> 01:59:07.440]  company allows you to have it's true total government control of
[01:59:07.440 --> 01:59:10.960]  electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming
[01:59:10.960 --> 01:59:14.640]  number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[01:59:14.640 --> 01:59:17.600]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation
[01:59:17.600 --> 01:59:21.520]  is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a
[01:59:21.520 --> 01:59:25.120]  threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their power
[01:59:25.120 --> 01:59:29.040]  from weather related onages number five a solar power generator provides
[01:59:29.040 --> 01:59:32.480]  powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks i really believe in the
[01:59:32.480 --> 01:59:35.680]  solar power generators offered by solutions from science one of my old

[01:59:53.680 --> 02:00:00.240]  waging war on corruption alex jones on the gcm radio network
[02:00:05.440 --> 02:00:10.240]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups
[02:00:10.240 --> 02:00:15.200]  you want answers well so does he he's alex jones
[02:00:15.200 --> 02:00:22.560]  on the gcm radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[02:00:22.560 --> 02:00:27.360]  well this interview has really gone fast love to have him up again and take
[02:00:27.360 --> 02:00:31.280]  calls for those of you that may disagree with anything he's saying
[02:00:31.280 --> 02:00:34.800]  but uh when i have you back next time i understand you wanted to cover some of
[02:00:34.800 --> 02:00:37.680]  the basics but people can always find that at your sites
[02:00:37.680 --> 02:00:41.600]  right yawn i mean i mean i've done the research you've
[02:00:41.600 --> 02:00:44.320]  done and i know you've done some research i have it so i wanted you to
[02:00:44.320 --> 02:00:48.880]  expand out just into the rat mazes the social conditioning
[02:00:48.880 --> 02:00:51.920]  all the things that are going on you know the government documents and
[02:00:51.920 --> 02:00:54.960]  corporate documents where this is admitted i mean they admit they're
[02:00:54.960 --> 02:00:57.520]  manipulating people and they cold-bloodily are doing it
[02:00:57.520 --> 02:01:00.720]  so if you could just show folks that i think at the end of the day to get
[02:01:00.720 --> 02:01:04.400]  people thinking and really challenging their beliefs
[02:01:04.400 --> 02:01:08.000]  and becoming aware and not just kind of passively in a trance
[02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:11.520]  going through life i think that's really the most important thing but i talk
[02:01:11.520 --> 02:01:15.280]  about television a little bit talk about the rat mazes that are then
[02:01:15.280 --> 02:01:18.400]  you know directly moved to the shopping centers
[02:01:18.400 --> 02:01:24.560]  well bf skinner was the first one getting uh rats and pigeons to respond to
[02:01:24.560 --> 02:01:30.800]  stimulus basically by starving them and uh so by by withholding about a third
[02:01:30.800 --> 02:01:34.320]  of these pigeons food they could get the pigeons to react to different
[02:01:34.320 --> 02:01:38.080]  letters almost like they were reading and then peck on a box or open a door
[02:01:38.080 --> 02:01:42.000]  or something like that and so that's why they destroy economies whenever
[02:01:42.000 --> 02:01:45.040]  they're about to make big social changes that are popular
[02:01:45.040 --> 02:01:49.840]  you're exactly right so they're the bird and the rats food is our money right
[02:01:49.840 --> 02:01:53.520]  and that's exactly how they're doing this uh eldest huxley said
[02:01:53.520 --> 02:01:58.240]  it really did a really efficient totalist excuse me totalitarian state
[02:01:58.240 --> 02:02:02.240]  would be one in which the all-powerful executive of political bosses and their
[02:02:02.240 --> 02:02:06.720]  army of managers control a population of slaves who do not have to be coerced
[02:02:06.720 --> 02:02:10.480]  because they love their servitude to make them love it is
[02:02:10.480 --> 02:02:14.400]  the task assigned in present day totalitarian states
[02:02:14.400 --> 02:02:18.320]  to ministries of propaganda newspaper editors school teachers
[02:02:18.320 --> 02:02:21.520]  the greatest triumphs of propaganda have been accomplished
[02:02:21.520 --> 02:02:25.120]  not by doing something but by refraining from doing
[02:02:25.120 --> 02:02:30.640]  truth is wait greatest truth but but still greater from a practical
[02:02:30.640 --> 02:02:34.480]  from a practical point of view is silence about truth
[02:02:34.480 --> 02:02:37.600]  and so it's people not taking action not
[02:02:37.600 --> 02:02:40.800]  getting up and finding out what these logical fallacies are
[02:02:40.800 --> 02:02:44.640]  not learning you know as soon as you study if you go on
[02:02:44.640 --> 02:02:48.480]  the triviumeducation.com website and study the logical fallacies on there
[02:02:48.480 --> 02:02:51.520]  for 20 minutes and then go watch corporate media
[02:02:51.520 --> 02:02:55.200]  you'll be able to start spotting those logical fallacies right away
[02:02:55.200 --> 02:02:58.560]  it is immediate that you can begin applying these and what's happening is
[02:02:58.560 --> 02:03:01.920]  we're set in front of the television our diapers from birth
[02:03:01.920 --> 02:03:06.560]  and we're literally taught this it's the ether we swim in
[02:03:06.560 --> 02:03:10.080]  until the entire culture becomes delusional and what i'm seeing
[02:03:10.080 --> 02:03:14.960]  is that the ruling class themselves uh have been infected by their own
[02:03:14.960 --> 02:03:18.400]  propaganda by blowback and they are they are now
[02:03:18.400 --> 02:03:22.560]  addled and pathetic exactly and not only that but they've started
[02:03:22.560 --> 02:03:26.320]  by accident somewhere along the line they've started giving their own
[02:03:26.320 --> 02:03:29.760]  a bastardized form of the trivium it's out of order on their own because you
[02:03:29.760 --> 02:03:32.080]  can tell because they're irrational thinkers now
[02:03:32.080 --> 02:03:35.360]  they think that they have all of the solutions and all of the data
[02:03:35.360 --> 02:03:39.440]  but uh it's clear that they haven't been doing their data gathering or their
[02:03:39.440 --> 02:03:43.600]  grammar so uh you know it's it's very important
[02:03:43.600 --> 02:03:47.360]  that well they have the google nsa spy grid where they want
[02:03:47.360 --> 02:03:51.200]  uh the uh data you know that you know that first level
[02:03:51.200 --> 02:03:55.200]  uh but then they're obviously not using the information they're getting
[02:03:55.200 --> 02:03:58.720]  i mean take all the open air genetic engineering which all their own study
[02:03:58.720 --> 02:04:01.760]  show could really hurt the planet they're not worried
[02:04:01.760 --> 02:04:03.920]  about that we're not even having a debate about that
[02:04:03.920 --> 02:04:07.600]  oh well even tim trails you know and all this stuff that i see him sprain and i
[02:04:07.600 --> 02:04:11.120]  know a lot of people argue against no they're nihilistic it's going on the
[02:04:11.120 --> 02:04:14.480]  that's what i'm saying is that is that they're a bunch of spoiled brats who
[02:04:14.480 --> 02:04:18.720]  are sabotaging themselves and us they want to tax carbon that plants
[02:04:18.720 --> 02:04:24.080]  used to live but then they want to allow just all this other craziness that we
[02:04:24.080 --> 02:04:28.560]  know from their own data is deadly right
[02:04:28.560 --> 02:04:32.400]  exactly you know and uh what they've
[02:04:32.400 --> 02:04:37.840]  done really is they've created a a society of soulless people
[02:04:37.840 --> 02:04:42.640]  through the education system and dumbing us down through this this whole
[02:04:42.640 --> 02:04:46.320]  skinner's box sort of mentality and the and the wundian
[02:04:46.320 --> 02:04:49.200]  phd system we're going to talk about that next time

[02:08:51.840 --> 02:08:55.600]  now they're being phased in at all airports and they splatter
[02:08:55.600 --> 02:09:01.920]  radiation out at people i have a letter here that's confidential

[02:10:50.320 --> 02:10:53.520]  this during the break this is pretty big news
[02:10:53.520 --> 02:10:56.720]  and this deals with the body scanning sony employees when they
[02:10:56.720 --> 02:10:59.440]  leave the building
[02:11:02.800 --> 02:11:07.280]  all right here i won't longer work for sony after they get the scanner put in
[02:11:07.280 --> 02:11:10.560]  and when i was in the office they were talking about
[02:11:10.560 --> 02:11:15.360]  homeland security and the scanner by phone or by the net
[02:11:15.360 --> 02:11:19.600]  uh thanks this doesn't even say it's confidential
[02:11:19.600 --> 02:11:24.000]  what is there other letters what why did you tell me it's confidential

[02:11:33.680 --> 02:11:38.800]  uh is confidential um that that is they don't want the public
[02:11:38.800 --> 02:11:41.600]  knowing this they want to hide this they want to start
[02:11:41.600 --> 02:11:47.120]  microwaving their employees um without telling them i'm going to have to get
[02:11:47.120 --> 02:11:49.520]  this
[02:11:51.840 --> 02:11:54.800]  yeah go ahead and give me a document cam shot of this and we'll scan this in and
[02:11:54.800 --> 02:11:58.960]  get it over to watson uh and have one of those guys
[02:11:58.960 --> 02:12:02.320]  are curtain in my rod of story about this let me just read it since i got
[02:12:02.320 --> 02:12:05.360]  started see i read this during the break and kind of talked through it
[02:12:05.360 --> 02:12:09.120]  here on air with everybody you're getting the behind the scenes here we
[02:12:09.120 --> 02:12:12.880]  don't have time to have behind the scenes uh you know discussions behind
[02:12:12.880 --> 02:12:15.360]  the scenes we got to have it right out in the open there's a time
[02:12:15.360 --> 02:12:19.920]  all sony da dc american bowling brook employees
[02:12:19.920 --> 02:12:23.280]  you've received a letter recently from dav rubenstein
[02:12:23.280 --> 02:12:28.080]  president of sony da dc america is concerning your new anti piracy hotline
[02:12:28.080 --> 02:12:31.840]  in this letter dav stated that we are on a daily basis entrusted
[02:12:31.840 --> 02:12:35.360]  as the steward of our customers content that's folks sending dvds
[02:12:35.360 --> 02:12:39.120]  to be mass-duplicated i guess for blu-ray that and i know this facility i've
[02:12:39.120 --> 02:12:42.320]  almost used it before we're thinking about doing some blu-ray
[02:12:42.320 --> 02:12:45.920]  assets and intellectual property and that our content protection
[02:12:45.920 --> 02:12:50.080]  responsibility can be undermined by a single person stealing copying
[02:12:50.080 --> 02:12:54.400]  or diverting a disk or electronic file outside the company so
[02:12:54.400 --> 02:12:57.440]  i think it all sounds reasonable you know your prisoners coming in
[02:12:57.440 --> 02:13:00.800]  you agree to work here but we're now going to microwave you well you're not
[02:13:00.800 --> 02:13:05.360]  allowed as part of company policy uh under osho but of course the feds won't
[02:13:05.360 --> 02:13:07.440]  enforce that that they're the ones leading this
[02:13:07.440 --> 02:13:12.800]  to to put some eye in the scanner uh but they're going to do it
[02:13:12.800 --> 02:13:16.000]  to further support our responsibilities in this regard we're in the process of
[02:13:16.000 --> 02:13:20.240]  introducing technology improvements to our exit scanning methods
[02:13:20.240 --> 02:13:23.520]  at our manufacturing distribution facilities the new scanning devices
[02:13:23.520 --> 02:13:28.160]  that we have chosen to employ were selected based on their first safety
[02:13:28.160 --> 02:13:33.120]  and non-intrusive characteristics oh just like tsa says they don't stick their
[02:13:33.120 --> 02:13:35.680]  hands down your pants but then admitted they do or
[02:13:35.680 --> 02:13:38.880]  the tsa claims the scanners are safe but wouldn't give congress the documents
[02:13:38.880 --> 02:13:41.920]  the documents came out it turns out they're not safe
[02:13:41.920 --> 02:13:48.080]  number two effectiveness in three improving uh throughput times was what
[02:13:48.080 --> 02:13:52.400]  reduced delays for employees and guests i guess because they search you
[02:13:52.400 --> 02:13:54.880]  although i mean that's like going to a movie theater now before and they've
[02:13:54.880 --> 02:13:58.560]  had uh you know people demanding that you give them your cell phones when you
[02:13:58.560 --> 02:14:00.960]  go into a movie because somebody might videotape it
[02:14:00.960 --> 02:14:04.320]  no you find out who videotapes the film who uploads it
[02:14:04.320 --> 02:14:07.760]  and then civilly you go after him you don't treat everyone as a criminal
[02:14:07.760 --> 02:14:12.720]  but this is the new conversion of society guilty until proven innocent
[02:14:12.720 --> 02:14:15.760]  and you're going to say well then don't work at zoning or don't work at a
[02:14:15.760 --> 02:14:20.640]  government building or don't uh
[02:14:20.640 --> 02:14:27.120]  don't fly but but now tsa is going on the streets this is a you know
[02:14:27.120 --> 02:14:32.320]  it's total control it's turning the whole planet into a prison
[02:14:32.320 --> 02:14:35.440]  although the scanners may look similar to what you might have seen at some
[02:14:35.440 --> 02:14:38.720]  airports oh they are in reality quite different in
[02:14:38.720 --> 02:14:42.400]  that they do not reveal anatomical details well they've
[02:14:42.400 --> 02:14:45.280]  now added that software at the airport too where they claim
[02:14:45.280 --> 02:14:49.440]  that that well what the screener sees is an overlay of a stick figure
[02:14:49.440 --> 02:14:52.720]  but it turns out that isn't true either so this this whole thing is there to
[02:14:52.720 --> 02:14:56.560]  just see if they can get away with it although the scanners may look
[02:14:56.560 --> 02:15:00.480]  similar remember the japanese government lying and saying the radiation was low
[02:15:00.480 --> 02:15:03.760]  and that there hadn't any meltdowns when they knew for months there had been
[02:15:03.760 --> 02:15:07.280]  it's the same thing it's just it's just a culture of lies and the person writing
[02:15:07.280 --> 02:15:11.760]  this is probably delusional you know and then buys into it
[02:15:11.760 --> 02:15:18.800]  you know it's magical thinking if i say uh if i say that this isn't bad for me
[02:15:18.800 --> 02:15:23.120]  then it's not it's like 20 years ago they wouldn't use du in the military
[02:15:23.120 --> 02:15:27.120]  because the the army's own studies and tests and handbooks said that it will
[02:15:27.120 --> 02:15:32.960]  uh kill you may take a decade or two but it will kill you if you use this
[02:15:32.960 --> 02:15:36.880]  but now they just said we're ignoring that we now say it's safe
[02:15:36.880 --> 02:15:41.760]  kind of like i have tv promotion pieces the government put out on cbs
[02:15:41.760 --> 02:15:45.360]  saying mercury is now good for your brain because we say so
[02:15:45.360 --> 02:15:47.840]  you don't believe me they're not going to believe it i know we got that next
[02:15:47.840 --> 02:15:52.000]  video clip ready but well i'm not kidding folks i actually have news clips
[02:15:52.000 --> 02:15:55.280]  saying that although the scanners may look similar to what you might have
[02:15:55.280 --> 02:15:58.800]  seen at some airports they are in reality quite different and that they do
[02:15:58.800 --> 02:16:03.120]  not reveal anatomical details of a person's body and they are passive
[02:16:03.120 --> 02:16:06.560]  technology meaning that they do not transmit or emit any energy such as
[02:16:06.560 --> 02:16:10.800]  backscatter x-rays thus the scanners pose no harm to people
[02:16:10.800 --> 02:16:13.760]  even those with medical conditions we're told that by the airport people who
[02:16:13.760 --> 02:16:18.320]  know they do or medical devices such as pacemaker insulin pump
[02:16:18.320 --> 02:16:22.880]  prosthesis the scanner simply takes pictures much like a handheld digital
[02:16:22.880 --> 02:16:25.760]  camera and does not transmit any energy
[02:16:25.760 --> 02:16:28.960]  onto the subject in the form of waves or particles i don't know how then they
[02:16:28.960 --> 02:16:32.640]  see what's going on with that to respect your privacy security personnel
[02:16:32.640 --> 02:16:38.880]  will only see the blacked out silhouette of a person's body
[02:16:38.880 --> 02:16:43.440]  and any items that are being concealed will be highlighted the images produced
[02:16:43.440 --> 02:16:46.880]  will not reveal any anatomical detail of a person's body see
[02:16:46.880 --> 02:16:49.680]  images below no scan images will be stored copied or
[02:16:49.680 --> 02:16:52.640]  transmitted they will be erased once you have
[02:16:52.640 --> 02:16:56.000]  completed your scan this is exactly what the tsa said two years ago
[02:16:56.000 --> 02:16:59.040]  turned out it's all not true i i hope they're being honest here
[02:16:59.040 --> 02:17:02.400]  everyone visitors employees including management exit facility will be
[02:17:02.400 --> 02:17:05.920]  required to go through the scanner as with our other security initiatives
[02:17:05.920 --> 02:17:09.680]  your cooperation is essential to ensure that sony da dc
[02:17:09.680 --> 02:17:13.280]  succeeds in its commitment to achieving and maintaining the highest security
[02:17:13.280 --> 02:17:16.400]  standards thank you in advance for your cooperation
[02:17:16.400 --> 02:17:19.520]  any questions regarding this program should be addressed to your human
[02:17:19.520 --> 02:17:23.200]  resources representative and this is from trint mulroney senior
[02:17:23.200 --> 02:17:27.760]  vice president distribution now there is the body scan
[02:17:27.760 --> 02:17:32.640]  and it shows the body and and they don't explain how this sees

[02:17:37.600 --> 02:17:42.640]  but but but it sees beneath your clothes and don't worry we black it out
[02:17:42.640 --> 02:17:45.680]  what does that mean
[02:17:47.040 --> 02:17:51.360]  and it says simple sample image that security personnel will see
[02:17:51.360 --> 02:17:55.040]  i mean tsa tried stuff like this so this needs to be investigated
[02:17:55.040 --> 02:18:02.240]  and looked into but the employee we got the letter from
[02:18:02.240 --> 02:18:09.040]  says that it is a body scanner well they've now
[02:18:09.040 --> 02:18:13.680]  confirmed they're going to put the fast system these 18 wheeler tractor trailers
[02:18:13.680 --> 02:18:19.120]  with body scanners brain scanners um in every city in the country and they're
[02:18:19.120 --> 02:18:22.880]  going to run everybody through these you know what i've i've got this guest
[02:18:22.880 --> 02:18:26.240]  coming up who really is on the front lines of confronting corruption and
[02:18:26.240 --> 02:18:32.560]  and and hypocrisy by police and i can't really do justice
[02:18:32.560 --> 02:18:40.800]  to uh jimmy justice uh here on air if you go to his site
[02:18:40.800 --> 02:18:46.320]  you can see hundreds of videos the last three years or so
[02:18:46.320 --> 02:18:50.640]  where he shows police breaking the law in in every manner you can imagine
[02:18:50.640 --> 02:18:53.920]  illegal turns reckless driving smoking drinking in the car
[02:18:53.920 --> 02:18:56.400]  and then they come up and try to beat him up and knock the camera out of his
[02:18:56.400 --> 02:19:00.720]  family videotapes that cops with their family in their squad cars parking in
[02:19:00.720 --> 02:19:03.360]  front of fire hydrants and and the reason this is so
[02:19:03.360 --> 02:19:07.040]  important is in new york they throw the book at people
[02:19:07.040 --> 02:19:10.480]  and the police have even to their credit run an ad in the new york times
[02:19:10.480 --> 02:19:13.760]  complaining years ago that we've been ordered to raise more money
[02:19:13.760 --> 02:19:16.640]  we don't want to give you tickets for sitting on a park bench more than five
[02:19:16.640 --> 02:19:19.520]  minutes we don't want to
[02:19:19.520 --> 02:19:24.640]  uh harass people for throwing you know trash in a city trash can
[02:19:24.640 --> 02:19:28.640]  we don't like this but we've been told to do it so i i can see why the cops are
[02:19:28.640 --> 02:19:32.560]  ignoring the laws but the point is you know this stuff's so good you need to
[02:19:32.560 --> 02:19:35.200]  follow it and you certainly shouldn't assault
[02:19:35.200 --> 02:19:38.640]  people so that's coming up i meant to go into overdrive
[02:19:38.640 --> 02:19:42.320]  today just because cps takes custody of six

[02:24:25.200 --> 02:24:29.040]  oh this is for traffic and in a way it was true because it had the dual use of
[02:24:29.040 --> 02:24:33.040]  traffic but it was also wired into the federalized centers the threat fusion
[02:24:33.040 --> 02:24:37.760]  centers that are now public and sysco microsoft google have
[02:24:37.760 --> 02:24:42.480]  all helped china surveil their own populations but remember before
[02:24:42.480 --> 02:24:46.240]  they were done building this oh that's a conspiracy theory we're not face scanning
[02:24:46.240 --> 02:24:51.440]  you we're not tracking you we're not reading your license plate

[02:25:05.520 --> 02:25:09.760]  that officials not servants say will prevent crime but that human rights
[02:25:09.760 --> 02:25:12.800]  advocates warn could target political dissent
[02:25:12.800 --> 02:25:15.520]  well yeah because the government is criminal so it's so they can carry out
[02:25:15.520 --> 02:25:19.200]  their crime of domination now i want to shift gears for the next four or five
[02:25:19.200 --> 02:25:22.000]  minutes before we come in here with jimmy justice
[02:25:22.000 --> 02:25:26.000]  i want to shift gears to ted anderson of mitis resources
[02:25:26.000 --> 02:25:29.520]  um ted you know folks should know the drill by now
[02:25:29.520 --> 02:25:34.880]  economically uh the 11 year graph for gold and silver shows both of them and
[02:25:34.880 --> 02:25:39.920]  their meteoric rise silver 700 gold close to 500 percent
[02:25:39.920 --> 02:25:43.440]  and every summer it started the summer gold goes down a bit
[02:25:43.440 --> 02:25:47.440]  before retracing its previous highs and and going above them in the fall
[02:25:47.440 --> 02:25:52.640]  winter and spring but to have in the middle of summer now
[02:25:52.640 --> 02:25:57.040]  gold and silver rocketing back up again uh because of talk of dollar
[02:25:57.040 --> 02:26:01.680]  devaluation and and defaults in europe uh wow i i can't imagine what it's
[02:26:01.680 --> 02:26:06.880]  going to be coming up uh in the uh fall and uh obviously we
[02:26:06.880 --> 02:26:09.520]  always tell folks this i hope they're smart and do it people tend to buy
[02:26:09.520 --> 02:26:13.040]  gold and silver when it goes up ted always buys it when it's low and then
[02:26:13.040 --> 02:26:15.280]  sells it to at the low price when it goes up
[02:26:15.280 --> 02:26:18.400]  but now stuff you bought a month ago when it was a lot lower you're getting
[02:26:18.400 --> 02:26:21.200]  ready to run out of that so i wanted to get you up here today to talk a little
[02:26:21.200 --> 02:26:25.440]  briefly about the economy but also the special radio offers in gold and silver
[02:26:25.440 --> 02:26:27.600]  because you were telling me this morning you're getting ready to run out of the
[02:26:27.600 --> 02:26:31.280]  gold and silver you bought when it did have that big dip it's almost retraced
[02:26:31.280 --> 02:26:35.040]  its losses especially in gold but folks can get in a time machine today
[02:26:35.040 --> 02:26:38.800]  with this radio offer and go back and take advantage of that dip even though
[02:26:38.800 --> 02:26:41.520]  it's racing up where's gold and silver right now ted
[02:26:41.520 --> 02:26:46.880]  well gold hit a high today of 1535 and silver hit a high today of 3638 and
[02:26:46.880 --> 02:26:50.560]  yeah you're right it is going up i mean gold's up 12 dollars and 70 cents
[02:26:50.560 --> 02:26:54.240]  currently and uh yeah it's it's it's a hot market in
[02:26:54.240 --> 02:26:58.320]  the summer which is just unusual but when you have the kind of
[02:26:58.320 --> 02:27:03.040]  problems that we have economically uh going on in europe and also the united
[02:27:03.040 --> 02:27:07.440]  states uh we're having trouble you know you you sent me that
[02:27:07.440 --> 02:27:10.400]  video the american dream and big brother i know you're getting
[02:27:10.400 --> 02:27:14.720]  a lot of those books out yourself but uh you know i'm going to help you with that
[02:27:14.720 --> 02:27:19.360]  we do have silver dollars we're we're putting two silver dollars
[02:27:19.360 --> 02:27:24.000]  big brother and the american dream together as a package it's 70
[02:27:24.000 --> 02:27:26.640]  dollars plus five dollars shipping and handling
[02:27:26.640 --> 02:27:33.200]  um elix that that video is it's an animation but everybody should see
[02:27:33.200 --> 02:27:36.720]  that video because it's the banking system that's
[02:27:36.720 --> 02:27:41.040]  destroying the world and this puts it in such simple turns
[02:27:41.040 --> 02:27:44.480]  so people can understand what's going on but that is gonna
[02:27:44.480 --> 02:27:47.760]  we're gonna we're gonna send that out free of charge all you have to do is
[02:27:47.760 --> 02:27:51.280]  pick up the two silver dollars and and the silver you know
[02:27:51.280 --> 02:27:57.600]  coming up on 36 dollars an ounce 3638 a high today um that's more than 70
[02:27:57.600 --> 02:28:01.360]  bucks just in silver alone and we're delivering at 75
[02:28:01.360 --> 02:28:04.480]  dollars the videos and the silver dollars now let's you let's use some
[02:28:04.480 --> 02:28:07.920]  logic here explain what they're getting for that price
[02:28:07.920 --> 02:28:11.840]  well first of all you're going to get two silver dollars and that is
[02:28:11.840 --> 02:28:15.920]  worth the money right there then you have the video which is worth 20 bucks
[02:28:15.920 --> 02:28:19.440]  and you have the book that's worth 20 bucks so if you put that together you're

[02:28:54.160 --> 02:28:57.760]  making money on this trade but i think it's just really important that people

[02:29:00.320 --> 02:29:04.240]  we yeah what we're watching as we just move on down the road

[02:29:29.680 --> 02:29:33.040]  money and ted's very competitive that's why he's now what the fourth or fifth

[02:31:03.760 --> 02:31:07.840]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily
[02:31:07.840 --> 02:31:11.760]  double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants
[02:31:11.760 --> 02:31:15.200]  to control how much power your electric company allows you to have
[02:31:15.200 --> 02:31:19.440]  it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[02:31:19.440 --> 02:31:23.840]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid
[02:31:23.840 --> 02:31:27.520]  is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation
[02:31:27.520 --> 02:31:31.440]  is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a
[02:31:31.440 --> 02:31:34.560]  threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose
[02:31:34.560 --> 02:31:38.480]  their power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator
[02:31:38.480 --> 02:31:41.360]  provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind
[02:31:41.360 --> 02:31:44.480]  folks i really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from

[02:34:10.400 --> 02:34:16.800]  there's no way to do justice to this pun intended i asked jaren over the
[02:34:16.800 --> 02:34:19.520]  weekend sent him an i am and said please get
[02:34:19.520 --> 02:34:22.960]  jimmy justice on and he did and there's literally i don't know 50
[02:34:22.960 --> 02:34:28.960]  100 200 i don't know videos on the jimmy justice youtube site
[02:34:28.960 --> 02:34:33.520]  and uh he catches police breaking every law you can imagine
[02:34:33.520 --> 02:34:37.120]  a lot of it petty stuff but drinking in their car smoking cigarettes parking
[02:34:37.120 --> 02:34:40.800]  in front of hard fire hydrants driving the wrong way
[02:34:40.800 --> 02:34:44.320]  and he and in new york they throw the book at you
[02:34:44.320 --> 02:34:49.200]  uh i mean here here's one today upper east side woman ticketed for using city
[02:34:49.200 --> 02:34:52.560]  trash can to sanitation worker was aggressive
[02:34:52.560 --> 02:34:57.040]  frightened the bleep out of her the double hockey sticks out of her
[02:34:57.040 --> 02:35:00.160]  and it goes on to talk about yes they do ticket you
[02:35:00.160 --> 02:35:03.760]  if you're seen throwing paper away in a trash can she threw
[02:35:03.760 --> 02:35:07.920]  a part of a newspaper in the trash so it's all part of the environmental police
[02:35:07.920 --> 02:35:12.000]  uh it's all about raising taxes i've seen videos of
[02:35:12.000 --> 02:35:16.880]  mainline reporters while they're choking an abc news reporter for no reason
[02:35:16.880 --> 02:35:20.720]  smoking cigars while they do it acting like goons
[02:35:20.720 --> 02:35:24.160]  and so i wanted to get jimmy justice on and we can play clips of this but you
[02:35:24.160 --> 02:35:25.920]  just got to go to his youtube channel i can't
[02:35:25.920 --> 02:35:30.560]  again i do justice to it and the incredible thing is he's usually very
[02:35:30.560 --> 02:35:33.200]  polite until they come over and slap his camera out
[02:35:33.200 --> 02:35:36.400]  even when they're off duty with their wife with their kids
[02:35:36.400 --> 02:35:40.800]  they'll pull up park in a handicap park in a
[02:35:40.800 --> 02:35:45.680]  you know a red zone they'll park in front of a
[02:35:45.680 --> 02:35:51.600]  water main uh fire hydrant and at the same time and i've been in new york a
[02:35:51.600 --> 02:35:54.880]  lot they if you ask for cop directions most
[02:35:54.880 --> 02:35:58.000]  the time they'll scream at you say do i look like a phone book
[02:35:58.000 --> 02:36:01.360]  i mean i've talked to austin police i know who've gone up there
[02:36:01.360 --> 02:36:04.080]  you know to visit new york and officer do you know where this is they're like
[02:36:04.080 --> 02:36:09.360]  do i look like a directory to you do i an example of the unions being out of
[02:36:09.360 --> 02:36:12.240]  control but i've never experienced anything i've been in third world
[02:36:12.240 --> 02:36:15.200]  countries like new york police i'm not saying some aren't good some are very
[02:36:15.200 --> 02:36:18.560]  nice uh but i want to play a short clip and
[02:36:18.560 --> 02:36:22.800]  this is just one of his newest videos uh we'll ask him how many he actually has
[02:36:22.800 --> 02:36:27.040]  i i didn't count him where it's a cop with his family in his car
[02:36:27.040 --> 02:36:30.640]  in in you know he's a supervisor he's in a uh you know
[02:36:30.640 --> 02:36:33.680]  unmarked police car but it's you know got government stickers and all that
[02:36:33.680 --> 02:36:36.480]  and he's parked in front of the fire hydrant he goes in the store shops comes
[02:36:36.480 --> 02:36:39.680]  out and jimmy justice's video and he comes over and
[02:36:39.680 --> 02:36:43.120]  you know tries to knock the camera out of his hand and then says i didn't
[02:36:43.120 --> 02:36:46.400]  knock that didn't try to knock you know didn't hit your camera it's this
[02:36:46.400 --> 02:36:50.640]  mind game we had new york cops this is in uh truth rising
[02:36:50.640 --> 02:36:55.120]  run up to us dozens of them drunk and attack and break two of our cameras i
[02:36:55.120 --> 02:36:57.920]  mean breaking microphones bolted down in metal
[02:36:57.920 --> 02:37:01.600]  these are like five six thousand our cameras just hitting them slapping them
[02:37:01.600 --> 02:37:05.360]  pushing on us just because they didn't like us
[02:37:05.360 --> 02:37:08.640]  and giggling while they do it i mean it's like gang members
[02:37:08.640 --> 02:37:16.320]  uh so let's play a short clip here uh of uh jimmy justice um you know simply
[02:37:16.320 --> 02:37:22.080]  videotaping a police officer parked in front of a fire hydrant here it is
[02:37:22.080 --> 02:37:27.360]  there's the officer getting in his car putting the goods in
[02:37:27.360 --> 02:37:32.320]  there's the fire hydrant this is only part of it he has them pulling up and
[02:37:32.320 --> 02:37:39.040]  going in and coming out
[02:37:39.040 --> 02:37:42.080]  and then the officer goes around the back i'm narrating this from
[02:37:42.080 --> 02:37:46.560]  radio listeners don't forget we're not just prison planet dot tv
[02:37:46.560 --> 02:37:50.560]  now the cop comes over boom hits his camera you can't touch me why you like
[02:37:50.560 --> 02:37:54.400]  to do whatever i want that's a man funny why you're allowed to touch me
[02:37:57.920 --> 02:38:01.600]  do you normally uh black fire hydrants and misuse your official police
[02:38:01.600 --> 02:38:08.160]  department placard when you go shopping with your family officer
[02:38:08.160 --> 02:38:13.760]  okay that's enough a command discipline is much worse than a parking summons
[02:38:13.760 --> 02:38:17.440]  okay let's stop right there to top it off and well let me he goes on and has
[02:38:17.440 --> 02:38:20.800]  some text about it the cop comes over hits his
[02:38:20.800 --> 02:38:24.720]  camera grabs at it and says i can do whatever i want
[02:38:24.720 --> 02:38:28.800]  and then engages in the double think of i didn't do anything i didn't touch your
[02:38:28.800 --> 02:38:33.360]  camera even though it's on video he slows it down grabs it tries to throw it down
[02:38:33.360 --> 02:38:36.880]  and i had msnbc reporters attack myself with a
[02:38:36.880 --> 02:38:42.080]  with a knife they cut my equipment uh attack richard reeves it's all on video
[02:38:42.080 --> 02:38:45.760]  in uh in the extras of obama deception it's online
[02:38:45.760 --> 02:38:48.640]  and the msnbc would laugh and say we didn't touch you they would they would
[02:38:48.640 --> 02:38:52.240]  attack with a knife cut up our equipment on video and say i didn't do
[02:38:52.240 --> 02:38:56.000]  anything right and with mind control that was shown in court many juries would
[02:38:56.000 --> 02:38:59.520]  go whoa they didn't do anything i mean they could be stabbing us with daggers
[02:38:59.520 --> 02:39:03.040]  with blood spraying out i'm not stabbing you and people are like well he said
[02:39:03.040 --> 02:39:06.000]  he's not so it's a conspiracy theory that he is
[02:39:06.000 --> 02:39:12.080]  this is the mind control the public is under uh going to uh jimmy justice here
[02:39:12.080 --> 02:39:15.600]  uh here's his bio he sent us as far as bio goes you can just say that i'm
[02:39:15.600 --> 02:39:20.560]  a video vigilante or copper rotsy i make videos in new york city police officers
[02:39:20.560 --> 02:39:24.000]  and traffic enforcement agents by the law in new york city there's a system of
[02:39:24.000 --> 02:39:27.760]  predatory ticketing the cops scour the streets and write summons for
[02:39:27.760 --> 02:39:31.760]  every petty nonsensical violation well i was arrested for
[02:39:31.760 --> 02:39:35.600]  something that wasn't even arrestable offense famously not for public safety
[02:39:35.600 --> 02:39:39.600]  but rather to raise revenue for the city i make videos of cops violating those
[02:39:39.600 --> 02:39:43.280]  same traffic laws while they are running personal errands
[02:39:43.280 --> 02:39:46.480]  on the company time i put these videos on my youtube page of the public
[02:39:46.480 --> 02:39:50.240]  pressure in four city hall to do more to curb the abuse of authority in the
[02:39:50.240 --> 02:39:53.520]  police department in the course of four years of making these videos
[02:39:53.520 --> 02:39:57.360]  i've had two cameras broken and i've been threatened with arrest numerous times
[02:39:57.360 --> 02:40:00.960]  i have found that a video camera is the best tool for showing the truth
[02:40:00.960 --> 02:40:06.000]  jimmy justice four seven five three on youtube or just search jimmy justice
[02:40:06.000 --> 02:40:10.480]  an amazing guy jimmy how many videos have you shot
[02:40:10.480 --> 02:40:17.920]  oh i have probably uh 20 to 25 hours of footage uh but that doesn't amount to
[02:40:17.920 --> 02:40:22.720]  25 hours of video sometimes i will stand uh out on the street for 10 minutes
[02:40:22.720 --> 02:40:27.280]  and wait for an officer to come out of uh mcdonald's where he's been eating
[02:40:27.280 --> 02:40:31.440]  lunch and i wait for him to get into his car uh that's part
[02:40:31.440 --> 02:40:34.800]  illegally perhaps blocking a fire hydrant or otherwise
[02:40:34.800 --> 02:40:39.840]  and then i can confront him uh but i i have many videos dozens of them on
[02:40:39.840 --> 02:40:44.160]  youtube uh showing the same police department that goes around
[02:40:44.160 --> 02:40:46.960]  new york city in order to raise revenue and of
[02:40:46.960 --> 02:40:50.880]  course it's not for public safety and they write 14 million
[02:40:50.880 --> 02:40:54.560]  parking violations every year uh to new york city
[02:40:54.560 --> 02:40:57.840]  residents uh for the most petty and nonsensical thing
[02:40:57.840 --> 02:41:00.640]  but then when they're running their own personal errands or they're getting
[02:41:00.640 --> 02:41:05.360]  their lunch or even when they're off duty in their own personal vehicle
[02:41:05.360 --> 02:41:08.560]  they uh they have this placard that they put in the windshield
[02:41:08.560 --> 02:41:13.360]  that says nypd and and that gives them immunity from
[02:41:13.360 --> 02:41:17.840]  obeying any of the traffic laws because as we know the police department does
[02:41:17.840 --> 02:41:22.000]  not uh prosecute each other uh in most cases
[02:41:22.000 --> 02:41:25.360]  unless there is an outcry uh from the public
[02:41:25.360 --> 02:41:29.600]  which forces city hall to do something about it and that usually happens when
[02:41:29.600 --> 02:41:32.880]  there's a video that gone viral on the internet or on
[02:41:32.880 --> 02:41:38.960]  television news why did you start doing this
[02:41:38.960 --> 02:41:43.600]  i started doing this uh because i got one too many
[02:41:43.600 --> 02:41:47.520]  unfair parking tickets that i didn't feel that i uh deserve
[02:41:47.520 --> 02:41:52.560]  and i just uh noticed some of the same officers writing me these tickets
[02:41:52.560 --> 02:41:56.320]  and then when i complained that i said i'm really parked legally
[02:41:56.320 --> 02:42:00.080]  it's not in your jurisdiction to give me a ticket for this situation and they
[02:42:00.080 --> 02:42:03.440]  would just laugh at me and uh curse me out and then just
[02:42:03.440 --> 02:42:06.480]  go on to the next car and uh write them a ticket as well
[02:42:06.480 --> 02:42:09.920]  and then i would notice these same people uh when they're getting their lunch
[02:42:09.920 --> 02:42:13.440]  when they're running their personal errands they violating the same law
[02:42:13.440 --> 02:42:17.760]  and it was just this double standard did you see the footage in rochester where
[02:42:17.760 --> 02:42:20.240]  they arrest the lady for videotaping in her own yard
[02:42:20.240 --> 02:42:24.800]  then they had a community action meeting about supporting her legal defense
[02:42:24.800 --> 02:42:27.840]  fund and the cops it turns out even people that weren't
[02:42:27.840 --> 02:42:31.680]  part of the meeting descended on the neighborhood just a regular
[02:42:31.680 --> 02:42:34.240]  neighborhood and would go up to cars that were
[02:42:34.240 --> 02:42:37.600]  more than 12 inches 12 and a half inches out from the curb
[02:42:37.600 --> 02:42:41.840]  and would give them tickets and laugh at them and when i've been in new york and
[02:42:41.840 --> 02:42:44.400]  i've been in third world countries this earlier
[02:42:44.400 --> 02:42:47.280]  the police either wear their hats way back on their head
[02:42:47.280 --> 02:42:50.400]  or way down on their head lucredowski shot footage
[02:42:50.400 --> 02:42:53.920]  when he was protesting at building seven uh the security guards come out and
[02:42:53.920 --> 02:42:56.960]  say we're gonna say you have a bomb we know you don't we're gonna call in a
[02:42:56.960 --> 02:43:00.080]  bomb threat we're gonna put you in prison and they call in the fake bomb
[02:43:00.080 --> 02:43:04.160]  threat on tape cops show up and go yeah you know it's right it's it's like a
[02:43:04.160 --> 02:43:07.920]  bucks bunny cartoon with mobsters they grab the camera say it's a gun
[02:43:07.920 --> 02:43:12.000]  you're going to jail i mean the cops are so corrupt these report authority in
[02:43:12.000 --> 02:43:16.800]  that case that they would engage in a fake
[02:43:16.800 --> 02:43:20.160]  bomb threat and then even give him the camera
[02:43:20.160 --> 02:43:23.040]  back when they said look we're gonna put you in jail
[02:43:23.040 --> 02:43:27.840]  if you don't leave for a bomb now leave and luc said well i guess i'll leave my
[02:43:27.840 --> 02:43:30.640]  god i mean so there's no indictments i mean
[02:43:30.640 --> 02:43:34.720]  here in texas i'll tell you right now if a cop got caught
[02:43:34.720 --> 02:43:37.840]  trying to claim somebody had a bomb and they knew they didn't that cop would
[02:43:37.840 --> 02:43:41.680]  go to the penitentiary and should i mean i'm not trying to bash new york because
[02:43:41.680 --> 02:43:44.720]  i love new yorkers i like the people in new york they're great people
[02:43:44.720 --> 02:43:47.760]  how did your cops get so corrupt is it the union
[02:43:47.760 --> 02:43:52.000]  i mean are they unstoppable because i've never been treated
[02:43:52.000 --> 02:43:55.920]  uh i mean i've been walking down the street in new york when the crowds
[02:43:55.920 --> 02:43:58.880]  aren't even that heavy and cops will just stand there going
[02:43:58.880 --> 02:44:04.640]  move along and i and i turn back like is this actually happening i mean are
[02:44:04.640 --> 02:44:11.120]  they crazy do they only hire uh crazy people what's going on there
[02:44:11.120 --> 02:44:14.400]  i would say that um the longer that the system goes
[02:44:14.400 --> 02:44:19.600]  unchecked by the public uh the more arrogant the system the police officers
[02:44:19.600 --> 02:44:23.440]  the government can become and we need people
[02:44:23.440 --> 02:44:26.720]  out there with video cameras we need people like you alex
[02:44:26.720 --> 02:44:30.800]  uh to get on the radio every day and tell us what's really going on behind
[02:44:30.800 --> 02:44:33.600]  the scenes we need to raise public awareness we need
[02:44:33.600 --> 02:44:36.800]  to have people learn their rights of what they can do
[02:44:36.800 --> 02:44:41.040]  and what they should expect from the government and how to recognize
[02:44:41.040 --> 02:44:44.320]  when the police department is not doing what they're supposed to do
[02:44:44.320 --> 02:44:48.720]  and it's when we have a good system of checks and balances
[02:44:48.720 --> 02:44:51.840]  that's when we can keep this corruption to a minimum
[02:44:51.840 --> 02:44:55.520]  there historically in the new york city police department there has always been
[02:44:55.520 --> 02:44:59.360]  corruption unfortunately it will probably always occur
[02:44:59.360 --> 02:45:04.720]  but we can do our best to minimize it and and keep it to the lowest possible
[02:45:04.720 --> 02:45:07.760]  level i want to comment on two or three things that you
[02:45:07.760 --> 02:45:11.520]  just mentioned the case in rochester i saw that video
[02:45:11.520 --> 02:45:15.840]  and uh that was one of the most offensive videos that i've ever seen
[02:45:15.840 --> 02:45:19.360]  uh this woman was in the front yard of her house
[02:45:19.360 --> 02:45:23.440]  on her private property and she was videotaping uh the police pulling
[02:45:23.440 --> 02:45:27.680]  somebody over and they took offense and they they trespassed on her private
[02:45:27.680 --> 02:45:30.400]  property and they beat her up and arrested her
[02:45:30.400 --> 02:45:34.160]  um and you have to think about this what was it
[02:45:34.160 --> 02:45:39.840]  that the police didn't want videotape and uh if you want me to guess i would say
[02:45:39.840 --> 02:45:43.360]  they were going to do some kind of illegal search on the person they pulled
[02:45:43.360 --> 02:45:46.640]  over uh they were going to do some tricks to try to
[02:45:46.640 --> 02:45:50.400]  find a reason to arrest this person or confiscate his property and they didn't
[02:45:50.400 --> 02:45:53.760]  want that videotape and then a week later they had a
[02:45:53.760 --> 02:45:58.640]  community meeting uh in order to uh maybe raise legal funds or talk
[02:45:58.640 --> 02:46:03.280]  about how to send this woman against the charges uh of obstructing
[02:46:03.280 --> 02:46:06.160]  governmental administration that the rochester police
[02:46:06.160 --> 02:46:11.600]  threw at her and yeah i saw this video uh five or six police cars that could
[02:46:11.600 --> 02:46:15.840]  have been going around rochester actually uh arresting 12 well that was my
[02:46:15.840 --> 02:46:19.120]  point and they're going with yard six and if
[02:46:19.120 --> 02:46:22.160]  you're more than 12 inches from the curve you're going to get a
[02:46:22.160 --> 02:46:25.680]  stomach that's ridiculous that's not the way to use your police department
[02:46:25.680 --> 02:46:30.880]  well but but here's what i'm saying though have you ever seen the footage
[02:46:30.880 --> 02:46:36.000]  of uh luke radowski with a permitted and they come up and say we're gonna say
[02:46:36.000 --> 02:46:39.200]  you got bombs and then the cops are so crazy
[02:46:39.200 --> 02:46:44.160]  they they admit all this say his cameras a gun say leave or you're going to jail
[02:46:44.160 --> 02:46:47.920]  for terrorism and hand him the camera back i mean those were
[02:46:47.920 --> 02:46:51.520]  hardcore felonies being committed by them i mean
[02:46:51.520 --> 02:46:56.640]  what's going on yeah now alex i am familiar with your work and i've seen
[02:46:56.640 --> 02:47:00.640]  some of your documentaries uh actually my favorite one is when you sneak into
[02:47:00.640 --> 02:47:05.440]  the bohemian grove yes and uh secretly tape that that weird bizarre
[02:47:05.440 --> 02:47:09.200]  satanic ritual that they do there that that was some great stuff and i also
[02:47:09.200 --> 02:47:14.640]  saw the footage um that you're discussing where the cops
[02:47:14.640 --> 02:47:17.760]  say we're gonna lie we're gonna say you have a bomb
[02:47:17.760 --> 02:47:20.640]  and it will take the judge a couple of days until they figure out that you
[02:47:20.640 --> 02:47:23.440]  don't have a bomb but meanwhile you'll spend the weekend in jail
[02:47:23.440 --> 02:47:27.600]  and that's so unfortunate that uh that cops can lie and get away with it
[02:47:27.600 --> 02:47:31.760]  and and and they have that much power and uh i wanted this that's one more
[02:47:31.760 --> 02:47:34.160]  thing uh you know there was this you know circus
[02:47:34.160 --> 02:47:38.560]  trial in florida uh about uh casey anthony who uh
[02:47:38.560 --> 02:47:43.120]  was a registered filter child and she was found not guilty of murder
[02:47:43.120 --> 02:47:47.360]  but she was found guilty on four counts of lying to the police
[02:47:47.360 --> 02:47:51.760]  now i agree if somebody hinders a a murder investigation by lying to the
[02:47:51.760 --> 02:47:54.640]  police uh they should be guilty of a crime
[02:47:54.640 --> 02:47:58.880]  however it made me think she's guilty of lying to the police
[02:47:58.880 --> 02:48:04.160]  but what about when the police lie to us courts have ruled that police can lie
[02:48:04.160 --> 02:48:06.960]  now uh and also now they've been the FBI's been
[02:48:06.960 --> 02:48:10.080]  caught lying to federal judges i mean it's called
[02:48:10.080 --> 02:48:14.080]  charity and and you know quite frankly
[02:48:14.080 --> 02:48:17.520]  first the fed said you're going to go to jail for lying to police like martha
[02:48:17.520 --> 02:48:21.840]  steward and they technically claim she lied because of an accounting error
[02:48:21.840 --> 02:48:25.520]  uh and so overall there we didn't have this previously so i'm against it
[02:48:25.520 --> 02:48:29.200]  i mean i mean i could see the rationale you know for saying well you lie to us
[02:48:29.200 --> 02:48:33.040]  but but now they say well in the first interview with the FBI you said
[02:48:33.040 --> 02:48:36.080]  that you had a hundred thousand dollars in the bank but it shows you had 20
[02:48:36.080 --> 02:48:39.440]  thousand over here and you're like well i was talking to him and i forgot that
[02:48:39.440 --> 02:48:43.920]  cd that my grandma gave me and they're like sorry i mean i watch folks go to
[02:48:43.920 --> 02:48:47.120]  prison for for quote lies like that but then
[02:48:47.120 --> 02:48:49.280]  meanwhile the police now call it as a joke
[02:48:49.280 --> 02:48:53.200]  liifying and it's well known they now train major police departments
[02:48:53.200 --> 02:48:56.560]  how to lie on the stand
[02:48:58.320 --> 02:49:02.880]  is that besides for lying you know the police department have their tricks
[02:49:02.880 --> 02:49:07.120]  uh that they do to intimidate people uh like if they walk up to somebody in the
[02:49:07.120 --> 02:49:11.600]  street and say let me see your id you know the laws may vary state to state
[02:49:11.600 --> 02:49:15.600]  but in new york i don't think you have to carry id no no a lot of them try to
[02:49:15.600 --> 02:49:19.040]  enforce failure id it's been overturned by every court in the land
[02:49:19.040 --> 02:49:23.680]  yeah in new york city the police are actually not uh allowed to ask for your
[02:49:23.680 --> 02:49:26.800]  id unless you either just committed a crime or
[02:49:26.800 --> 02:49:30.800]  or are about to commit reasonable suspicion yeah the reasonable
[02:49:30.800 --> 02:49:34.400]  suspicion that you're about to commit a crime so if they just walk down the
[02:49:34.400 --> 02:49:37.680]  street and say let me see your id you really don't have to show it
[02:49:37.680 --> 02:49:42.000]  and uh i suggest that all of your listeners should
[02:49:42.000 --> 02:49:47.520]  contact their local uh chapter of the htlu here in new york it's called the
[02:49:47.520 --> 02:49:51.280]  new york civil liberties union and they usually print out and give
[02:49:51.280 --> 02:49:54.480]  pamphlets uh to what you should and should not do when
[02:49:54.480 --> 02:49:57.840]  encountered by the police uh people have to learn their
[02:49:57.840 --> 02:50:02.720]  rights of what but i mean my question to you is why are new york police and
[02:50:02.720 --> 02:50:05.280]  as i said i've been in really bad third world
[02:50:05.280 --> 02:50:09.360]  countries and cops don't act like this uh i mean i've seen some bad stuff in
[02:50:09.360 --> 02:50:13.280]  mexico but they're they're even more professional while they're robbing you
[02:50:13.280 --> 02:50:16.160]  how did new york get where the police look like an
[02:50:16.160 --> 02:50:23.040]  archetypal goon out of a mobster movie i mean how how did it get like that
[02:50:23.040 --> 02:50:27.520]  i don't know how it died like that it was just many years of being unchecked
[02:50:27.520 --> 02:50:32.080]  and there is not a good system of checks and balances
[02:50:32.080 --> 02:50:35.760]  you know in the 30s there was a big corruption scandal in the 60s to the
[02:50:35.760 --> 02:50:40.800]  80s there they had the malin commission they'd have to fire 75 percent 76
[02:50:40.800 --> 02:50:44.640]  percent of all the detectives because 70 plus percent were dealing narcotics
[02:50:44.640 --> 02:50:48.240]  and now they just let them do it it's just like well we run things and
[02:50:48.240 --> 02:50:51.360]  so of course cops are gonna walk them go
[02:50:51.360 --> 02:50:54.640]  oh the goons call me they say you got a bomb you gonna go jail
[02:50:54.640 --> 02:51:01.120]  you got the bomb yeah you gonna go jail but i'm sorry folks this is too much

[02:54:12.080 --> 02:54:15.600]  and i'm going to make jaren standing there with a rubber mallet and hit me in
[02:54:15.600 --> 02:54:18.880]  the head with it if i don't because i want to talk about the fact that poor
[02:54:18.880 --> 02:54:21.840]  people are now having their children taken all over the united states
[02:54:21.840 --> 02:54:25.760]  for just being poor and i remember one time and i had to stop
[02:54:25.760 --> 02:54:29.760]  doing it about 11 years ago i went to the hospital because some listeners of
[02:54:29.760 --> 02:54:33.040]  mine who were being harassed by cps were about to have a baby
[02:54:33.040 --> 02:54:35.920]  you know blonde-haired blue-eyed baby they can get half a mil for those
[02:54:35.920 --> 02:54:39.200]  generally 300 thou and there's been admitted quotas for
[02:54:39.200 --> 02:54:41.600]  kids all over the country that have come out
[02:54:41.600 --> 02:54:44.400]  and the poor folks adopting them don't know you know what's going on that's
[02:54:44.400 --> 02:54:48.960]  why we're here informing them uh and i was there when the mother was crying
[02:54:48.960 --> 02:54:51.680]  and when by the time i got there i opened the door
[02:54:51.680 --> 02:54:56.320]  my handsome was with me as we swung the camera up and the the cop
[02:54:56.320 --> 02:55:00.960]  they have special cops assigned to the cps groups had his hand on the back of
[02:55:00.960 --> 02:55:03.520]  her neck squeezing her to make her sign the document
[02:55:03.520 --> 02:55:07.040]  and the documents they filled out to take the baby weren't even the baby's name
[02:55:07.040 --> 02:55:10.080]  it was from a case three years before with some other family
[02:55:10.080 --> 02:55:14.000]  they go to judges with just fake same forms
[02:55:14.000 --> 02:55:18.480]  and the judges just just take the kids uh these family courts didn't exist till
[02:55:18.480 --> 02:55:21.200]  the 20s there are eugenics court they would order
[02:55:21.200 --> 02:55:26.080]  sterilization right up into the 80s uh and uh i know we got jimmy justice on
[02:55:26.080 --> 02:55:29.840]  with us it just it it tears my guts out and i
[02:55:29.840 --> 02:55:33.680]  literally controlled myself didn't attack the
[02:55:33.680 --> 02:55:37.040]  cop who looked like a demon i mean it was like he looked satanic he looked
[02:55:37.040 --> 02:55:42.080]  he was smiling i controlling myself was so hard getting out of there
[02:55:42.080 --> 02:55:46.240]  that i crawled in the car and mike was in his car started crying
[02:55:46.240 --> 02:55:49.280]  and i literally even called into a local radio show and then had to try to cry
[02:55:49.280 --> 02:55:51.760]  and people misunderstood thought my kids have been grabbed while he got so
[02:55:51.760 --> 02:55:55.200]  upset must have been his kids i literally cried worse than when my
[02:55:55.200 --> 02:56:00.800]  grandfathers died my grandmother died it it and i say i have courage
[02:56:00.800 --> 02:56:07.200]  truth is folks that i cannot be around it the anguish of parents with wolves
[02:56:07.200 --> 02:56:11.920]  taking their children and i can't be around it because
[02:56:11.920 --> 02:56:19.040]  because i was one centimeter from well and i'm telling you
[02:56:19.040 --> 02:56:22.080]  folks justice needs to come in this country and needs to come through an
[02:56:22.080 --> 02:56:26.240]  awakening process and i i heard this poor black
[02:56:26.240 --> 02:56:31.200]  family on the news this morning had their kids taken for no reason and i
[02:56:31.200 --> 02:56:34.000]  you know and
[02:56:34.960 --> 02:56:37.760]  every time i start getting a few tears of my eyes on air when i'm really
[02:56:37.760 --> 02:56:41.040]  honest with people i get idiot emails saying that's fake
[02:56:41.040 --> 02:56:46.160]  you know what uh you you say that so you don't have to focus on the pain of
[02:56:46.160 --> 02:56:50.480]  what's happening to these children these families you say that as an ad hominem
[02:56:50.480 --> 02:56:53.840]  distraction i i'm fighting right now to not remember
[02:56:53.840 --> 02:56:58.480]  those memories to start bawling out of absolute soul wrenching pain
[02:56:58.480 --> 02:57:04.240]  because i have my soul i have my soul i'm nothing special but i have a soul
[02:57:04.240 --> 02:57:08.560]  i'm awake going back to jimmy justice i didn't mean to distract off but i
[02:57:08.560 --> 02:57:12.320]  and other issues i know i know they take kids in new york it came out new york
[02:57:12.320 --> 02:57:15.760]  daily news five six years ago they take little kids away there
[02:57:15.760 --> 02:57:18.800]  for medical experiments and even test pesticides on them
[02:57:18.800 --> 02:57:23.040]  do you ever see that in the new york news not in the mainstream news that's for
[02:57:23.040 --> 02:57:25.600]  short and i was in new york daily news and it's just
[02:57:25.600 --> 02:57:28.800]  like now cps worker did did blow the whistle on that
[02:57:28.800 --> 02:57:32.000]  because they one little black kid they poisoned the death they killed him uh
[02:57:32.000 --> 02:57:34.880]  in closing jimmy justice where's the best place to see what you're doing
[02:57:34.880 --> 02:57:38.400]  because all americans need to do similar things
[02:57:38.400 --> 02:57:43.440]  as of now the best place is on youtube but i don't know how much longer my
[02:57:43.440 --> 02:57:46.720]  videos will be on youtube and i might be a little bit of an
[02:57:46.720 --> 02:57:50.160]  ingrate uh because youtube did put me on the map
[02:57:50.160 --> 02:57:53.760]  to say anything bad about them but once they were brought out by google
[02:57:53.760 --> 02:57:58.800]  uh they just started censoring things uh political speech they they censor so
[02:57:58.800 --> 02:58:02.080]  many things and they pulled some of my videos off the air
[02:58:02.080 --> 02:58:05.760]  without explanation no i know that and you've got a challenge
[02:58:05.760 --> 02:58:09.680]  you've got to challenge those filings when you file that form it's in federal
[02:58:09.680 --> 02:58:14.320]  court under perjury but i would file see we can't let them run us out of there
[02:58:14.320 --> 02:58:17.600]  because that's where half the video views in the world are but i would agree
[02:58:17.600 --> 02:58:21.120]  you should copy your stuff to other other video sites as well
[02:58:21.120 --> 02:58:25.040]  jimmy justice i want to salute you god bless you i look forward to talking to
