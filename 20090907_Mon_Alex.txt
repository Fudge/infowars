[00:00.000 --> 00:10.860]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:10.860 --> 00:18.420]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:18.420 --> 00:25.940]  Texas Alex Jones look we've had a lot of great calls dealing with the flu and
[00:25.940 --> 00:28.800]  medical workers being told they're being told they've got to take it there's no
[00:28.800 --> 00:33.300]  law that's just made up I got a guest coming up about 30 minutes and I'm
[00:33.300 --> 00:36.900]  gonna continue with your calls but I want to cycle through the calls and get
[00:36.900 --> 00:42.300]  people to call in who see in L. E. O. 9 martial law takeover drill going on that's
[00:42.300 --> 00:46.500]  not me saying that FEMA says that this is foreign troops with US troops and
[00:46.500 --> 00:51.820]  FEMA and local police in a federalization drill which practices
[00:51.820 --> 00:54.620]  federalizing everything and then bringing the federal government under
[00:54.620 --> 00:58.500]  international control and everything's been building towards martial law for a
[00:58.500 --> 01:02.780]  long time this is probably just one more drill but we have to pay attention to
[01:02.780 --> 01:06.660]  each event we can't become conditioned to this but let's take a few calls right
[01:06.660 --> 01:09.780]  now before this investigative journalist joins us about weird secret
[01:09.780 --> 01:18.020]  societies in DC right now let's go to who's up next here Joel in Ohio you're
[01:18.020 --> 01:25.620]  on the air Joel hi Alex hey buddy yeah I have a question about the flu
[01:25.620 --> 01:31.980]  vaccination now understand that there's no real laws about the vaccinations and
[01:31.980 --> 01:35.300]  that's policies and recommend yeah there's never been a law there's an
[01:35.300 --> 01:40.380]  executive order signed by Bush and then reauthorized by Obama but when they run
[01:40.380 --> 01:44.740]  around saying oh you got to take the shot currently they haven't implemented
[01:44.740 --> 01:47.380]  that notice you don't hear the White House saying it they're just at the
[01:47.380 --> 01:50.940]  ground level so nobody gets spooked saying you got to take the shot go ahead
[01:50.940 --> 01:57.620]  what will the legal disposition of that be if they make it mandatory will that
[01:57.620 --> 02:07.260]  be an executive order or a real law or how will that work do we know yes look
[02:07.260 --> 02:10.140]  they're not going to be able to get everybody vaccinated this time they try
[02:10.140 --> 02:14.060]  each time to set up the federal bureaucracy not just here but worldwide
[02:14.060 --> 02:18.900]  to force everybody on to this to set the precedent kind of is just a
[02:18.900 --> 02:25.460]  background idea that it's the law that you've got to take shots and so they
[02:25.460 --> 02:30.140]  force police medical workers firemen and most say no most departments wake up
[02:30.140 --> 02:34.220]  and say no some departments are have particularly cowardly dumb people in
[02:34.220 --> 02:38.380]  them and weak-minded police chiefs and they accept or weak-minded hospital heads
[02:38.380 --> 02:42.180]  the last straw was when Tommy Thompson wouldn't even take the shot he was
[02:42.180 --> 02:45.500]  saying it's the law you got to take it and people said what law and I had fire
[02:45.500 --> 02:50.700]  chiefs and police chiefs on and hospital heads saying no in fact not just no
[02:50.700 --> 02:57.260]  hell no so but but they'll just keep coming back coming back just like we
[02:57.260 --> 03:00.860]  won't let him pass carbon taxes the last five times they're back again and this
[03:00.860 --> 03:05.700]  time pass it to the house they won't you know they tried dozens of times more
[03:05.700 --> 03:09.900]  than for more than 30 years to pass hate crimes laws for strict free speech they
[03:09.900 --> 03:13.740]  finally passed it out of the house it's now past the Senate it's going into
[03:13.740 --> 03:17.180]  conference you know they just keep coming back because they've got the
[03:17.180 --> 03:21.620]  fighting spirit because they know the fight belongs to who wants it most and
[03:21.620 --> 03:27.900]  we just got to get into the fight and say it's fun to fight these people but
[03:27.900 --> 03:31.380]  see once they get you to be self-centered and selfish you don't care
[03:31.380 --> 03:35.100]  about anybody including yourself and once people have that attitude it's an
[03:35.100 --> 03:41.460]  atmosphere where corruption and evil run wild you know you are making a
[03:41.460 --> 03:47.100]  difference in my life Alex I work at a store I keep endgame in circulation

[03:55.700 --> 03:59.580]  stuff and they're listening to what I have to say whereas in the past they
[03:59.580 --> 04:04.260]  would just give me a weird look and leave so it's very encouraging and I

[08:41.460 --> 08:46.660]  some of the best moments I had during the week precisely because we closed the
[08:46.660 --> 08:50.940]  doors C Street is also in the news anew because of something that happened on
[08:50.940 --> 08:55.060]  the House floor last week a member of Congress one with ties to C Street
[08:55.060 --> 08:59.220]  argued against public funding for abortion services by saying that if
[08:59.220 --> 09:05.460]  there were public funding for abortion Barack Obama might have been aborted as
[09:05.460 --> 09:14.300]  a fetus also Clarence Thomas if you think of it in human terms there is a
[09:14.300 --> 09:18.780]  financial incentive that will be put in place paid for by tax dollars they will
[09:18.780 --> 09:23.420]  encourage women who are in our single parents living below the poverty level
[09:23.420 --> 09:30.180]  to have the opportunity for a free abortion if you take that scenario and
[09:30.180 --> 09:33.740]  apply it to many of the great minds we have today who would we have been
[09:33.740 --> 09:40.620]  deprived of our president grew up in those similar circumstances if that
[09:40.620 --> 09:44.580]  financial incentive was in place is it possible that his mother may have taken
[09:44.580 --> 09:51.460]  advantage of it Clarence Thomas Supreme Court justice if those circumstances
[09:51.460 --> 09:56.500]  were in place is it possible that we have been denied his great mind it's

[10:53.420 --> 10:58.180]  article he wrote the New York Times he is a New York Times best-selling author
[10:58.180 --> 11:03.220]  of the family the secret fundamentalism at the heart of American power actually
[11:03.220 --> 11:06.220]  saw an article about him in the New York Times and a contributing editor to
[11:06.220 --> 11:09.900]  Harper's and Rolling Stone has been writing about the intersection of
[11:09.900 --> 11:15.180]  religion politics and culture for more than a decade his writing on religion
[11:15.180 --> 11:20.380]  has earned him praise from writers and it goes on from there his new book is the

[11:25.980 --> 11:30.100]  at the heart of American power he's here with us for most of the hour then
[11:30.100 --> 11:34.420]  wide open phones coming up at the end of the hour and in the fourth hour
[11:34.420 --> 11:40.220]  covering the flu hype and in LEO 9 martial law drills going on so that's
[11:40.220 --> 11:46.260]  coming up Jeff thank you for coming on with us you bet honor to have you I
[11:46.260 --> 11:51.620]  wanted to play Rachel Maddow kind of breaking down what you were going over
[11:51.620 --> 11:58.540]  first tell us about yourself how you got interested in this about this group on
[11:58.540 --> 12:06.220]  K Street this the family and then how it ties into Ashcroft's group the brotherhood
[12:06.220 --> 12:10.580]  that's also out of another house or the same house it all gets confusing there's
[12:10.580 --> 12:16.300]  other secretive right-wing Christian groups like the council on national
[12:16.300 --> 12:20.260]  policy there's a lot of different organizations and I haven't studied them
[12:20.260 --> 12:24.180]  all but I've tried to look at some of them tell us tell us about how you woke
[12:24.180 --> 12:33.940]  up to this group C Street there you go yes we think of K Street as the kind of
[12:33.940 --> 12:38.180]  the avenue of influence in Washington I think we've got a lobbyist out of
[12:38.180 --> 12:42.700]  Freudian slips sorry go ahead exactly what they're acting like you know it
[12:42.700 --> 12:48.260]  began I was a couple years ago working on my first book I was traveling around
[12:48.260 --> 12:52.620]  the country spending time with unusual religious communities and a friend of mine
[12:52.620 --> 12:57.900]  worried that her brother had joined a cult said would you meet with him this
[12:57.900 --> 13:03.060]  was way back in 2011 and so this guy came up I've known him for 12 years and
[13:03.060 --> 13:07.980]  frankly he'd always been kind of a jerk but he had really turned his life around
[13:07.980 --> 13:12.980]  despite the fact that his career left his relationship to move to Washington and
[13:12.980 --> 13:17.180]  be of service to powerful people and he said look you won't understand it unless
[13:17.180 --> 13:20.700]  you see it and you can't get in unless you're invited and I said well how do I
[13:20.700 --> 13:25.500]  apply and he said there are no applications there's just a family so I
[13:25.500 --> 13:30.460]  have an interesting to me not as a believer but just as a person who is
[13:30.460 --> 13:34.660]  interested about the the varieties of religious experience might say so I went
[13:34.660 --> 13:38.700]  down and spent about a month living with these guys and I didn't know it was
[13:38.700 --> 13:42.900]  political at first but then that we had a visit from Senator Jesse Helms okay
[13:42.900 --> 13:46.340]  all right I think I understand wait a minute I mean this doesn't sound and
[13:46.340 --> 13:50.100]  I'm not defending the group because I don't even know enough about it to to
[13:50.100 --> 13:53.980]  even get his name right but C Street the family C Street's the name and
[13:53.980 --> 13:59.100]  obviously the house if it's such a cult and I do agree it looks pretty culty
[13:59.100 --> 14:04.900]  why did they just let you right in then you know I well first of all I actually
[14:04.900 --> 14:08.180]  say that they are not a cult I don't think they are cultish but not a cult you
[14:08.180 --> 14:11.580]  know because the cult has certain characteristics they are cultish they've
[14:11.580 --> 14:15.100]  got the cult of personality around their leader Doug Koh but what they really
[14:15.100 --> 14:20.380]  believe they really believe in the sort of networks of elite and so because I
[14:20.380 --> 14:23.220]  was invited that's the only way you get in you get invited so because I was
[14:23.220 --> 14:28.140]  invited by this guy that made me sort of okay and I think they were actually
[14:28.140 --> 14:31.900]  interested in the fact that I'm a journalist the writer because they saw
[14:31.900 --> 14:37.460]  me as an influencer someone who can help spread the message so they had me into
[14:37.460 --> 14:40.500]  this house I originally wrote about this for Harper's magazine if anyone
[14:40.500 --> 14:43.420]  sitting out there being skeptical that all went through fact-checking legal
[14:43.420 --> 14:47.260]  review never been disputed live with these guys for a month okay but I mean
[14:47.260 --> 14:50.260]  they're pretty confident then about the way they operate and the way they work
[14:50.260 --> 14:54.940]  to let a prominent journalist into their midst though I wouldn't say it was
[14:54.940 --> 14:59.580]  prominent at that point but you know they've been around for 70 years they do
[14:59.580 --> 15:03.100]  believe in secrecy the leader of the group Doug Koh says the more invisible you
[15:03.100 --> 15:07.580]  can make your organization the more influence it will have okay so you did
[15:07.580 --> 15:13.020]  infiltrate to a certain level so this is cultish then you know which
[15:13.020 --> 15:17.940]  that's a really cultish I mean you know there's a cult of personality around this
[15:17.940 --> 15:21.540]  guy Doug Koh who may sometimes call first brother they say he has a special
[15:21.540 --> 15:27.380]  relationship with God unparalleled by anyone else in the world and that also
[15:27.380 --> 15:30.420]  that the inner circle members and here's where it gets really creepy when
[15:30.420 --> 15:33.220]  we're talking about Senator Infen and Governor Sanford guys linked to the
[15:33.220 --> 15:37.740]  group the inner circle members are not bound by the same morality that applies
[15:37.740 --> 15:42.340]  to the rest of us the morality is a human construct and God has a different
[15:42.340 --> 15:46.740]  different story ready for these powerful men now is this the same group that
[15:46.740 --> 15:49.380]  Ashcroft's part of it because I saw articles like four or five years ago
[15:49.380 --> 15:53.820]  about and did some research about Ashcroft part of a house he lived at and
[15:53.820 --> 15:57.740]  other people that were members I mean is this the only group like this are you
[15:57.740 --> 16:05.980]  aware of others I've been writing about this for a while John Ashcroft I
[16:05.980 --> 16:09.420]  lived with him for a month and then discovered they had dumped 600 boxes of
[16:09.420 --> 16:13.420]  documents unorganized they hadn't even 50 through them and Billy Graham's archive
[16:13.420 --> 16:16.580]  so I went so that was your article I did read about how they don't really care
[16:16.580 --> 16:21.380]  about abortion and they like Machiavelli wasn't it I mean I'm going from memory
[16:21.380 --> 16:25.020]  here much social issues John Ashcroft I found later letters dating back to the
[16:25.020 --> 16:29.100]  early 1980s John Ashcroft was writing to the leader of the group Doug Koh first
[16:29.100 --> 16:33.740]  brother saying that he wanted to get involved and could he be helped and
[16:33.740 --> 16:36.620]  that's what the family has done historically they've identified guys
[16:36.620 --> 16:40.540]  that they think they can work with and then they groomed them and sort of
[16:40.540 --> 16:44.860]  raise them up the political adder Doug Koh the leader of the group he likes to
[16:44.860 --> 16:49.220]  say we work with power where we can build new power where we can't and that
[16:49.220 --> 16:53.500]  means that they've got a lot of political allies in Washington a political
[16:53.500 --> 17:00.700]  religious fraternity okay well I mean I know I'm throwing a lot of points in
[17:00.700 --> 17:03.260]  here because I've over the years I've done research here there but you forget a
[17:03.260 --> 17:08.900]  lot more than you you know then you can actually comprehend but I know there's
[17:08.900 --> 17:13.900]  all these weird secretive groups did you ever run into any connections in this
[17:13.900 --> 17:21.700]  group with masons masonic groups or with opus day Catholic groups or with the
[17:21.700 --> 17:27.700]  cnp council on national policy there's a lot of overlap with the cnp guys like
[17:27.700 --> 17:33.460]  Ed Meese and various members like that but one of the most interesting connections I did find
[17:33.460 --> 17:36.620]  was with opus day and you might almost describe the family as kind of a
[17:36.620 --> 17:41.420]  Protestant opus day but they lack even the integrity of opus day but they
[17:41.420 --> 17:48.100]  originally they were very interested in working in Spain the international
[17:48.100 --> 17:52.580]  work around the world the dictator for a long time they was in Franco and he was
[17:52.580 --> 17:57.900]  not interested in any Protestant groups around until they made contact with the
[17:57.900 --> 18:02.580]  government opus day members and then sort of building up a network of alliances
[18:02.580 --> 18:06.100]  from our research I got to spend a lot of time with Senator Sam Roundback of
[18:06.100 --> 18:10.820]  Kansas who has a unique distinction of being a member of the family and an
[18:10.820 --> 18:15.300]  associate of opus day he converted to a very strange kind of Catholicism to opus
[18:15.300 --> 18:21.820]  day chapel which appropriately not actually is on pastry in Washington okay
[18:21.820 --> 18:24.540]  see those are the questions I haven't seen asked on television I've read your
[18:24.540 --> 18:27.820]  articles over the years and haven't read your book yet though we just got it and
[18:27.820 --> 18:31.780]  so I've got a piece here a piece there and I'm trying to delve more into the
[18:31.780 --> 18:36.460]  architecture of left-wing and right-wing groups did you ever run into any
[18:36.460 --> 18:40.740]  connections to Bohemian Grove because a lot of quote Christian conservatives
[18:40.740 --> 18:45.220]  that have these big public personas as Christian conservatives also go to the
[18:45.220 --> 18:53.220]  grove that Richard Nixon described as a homosexual orgy
[19:07.220 --> 19:12.540]  and so they do go to Bohemian Grove there is a Vatican connection there is a
[19:12.540 --> 19:16.940]  Bohemian Grove connection it's just always the same well I'm you know I'm
[19:16.940 --> 19:19.900]  actually worried making calling that a Vatican connection I would call that an
[19:19.900 --> 19:24.180]  opus day connection I think that's a day is a little bit distinct I mean you know
[19:24.180 --> 19:28.740]  look mainstream American Catholicism there is I have no issue with that what
[19:28.740 --> 19:32.660]  I'm not here bashing any groups either I mean this is a secular radio show I'm
[19:32.660 --> 19:37.020]  trying to see how all these groups tie together yeah I think I think you draw
[19:37.020 --> 19:40.540]  some connections that are important to make wow well listen I'm gonna try to let
[19:40.540 --> 19:42.820]  you roll me get back I just wanted to ask some questions that I haven't heard
[19:42.820 --> 19:49.020]  asked of you before and it's a truly great having you here with us the book

[24:33.900 --> 24:39.460]  goodie that is coming up later going back to the author of the family Jeff
[24:39.460 --> 24:43.780]  Charlotte and this is just a bottomless pit of weirdness but he's a great
[24:43.780 --> 24:51.300]  journalist writes for Harper's and for the New York Times as well I saw an
[24:51.300 --> 24:54.420]  article in New York Times he writes for Harper's and a rolling stone the reason
[24:54.420 --> 24:57.500]  I was bringing up Harper's it was actually Harper's had the interview with
[24:57.500 --> 25:02.260]  Nixon when he was talking about the Bohemian Grove and that was where my
[25:02.260 --> 25:05.460]  quote from that came okay you got the floor this is a short segment long
[25:05.460 --> 25:11.260]  segment coming up start at the beginning you you you get to get inside
[25:11.260 --> 25:16.220]  there you've written articles about how it's not really Christian though from not
[25:16.220 --> 25:20.060]  wanting to stop abortion and saying we like Machiavelli I'm going from memory
[25:20.060 --> 25:24.620]  here but a lot of weird stuff what is it really some type of strange intelligence
[25:24.620 --> 25:28.660]  front because just in a snapshot that's what it looks like to me
[25:28.660 --> 25:34.220]  you know it goes back it begins in 1935 they organize Abraham Brady believes
[25:34.220 --> 25:38.180]  that he has a vision that God comes to him and speaks to him tells him that
[25:38.180 --> 25:42.300]  Christianity has been getting it wrong for 2,000 years and any focus on the
[25:42.300 --> 25:46.620]  poor the weak is suffering the down and out that's not right well God wants him
[25:46.620 --> 25:51.500]  to be is a missionary to and for the powerful the up and out he calls them
[25:51.500 --> 25:57.420]  he begins organizing guys like Henry Ford and a group of congressmen he get
[25:57.420 --> 26:00.500]  some businessmen together he starts out in the state of Washington they manage
[26:00.500 --> 26:05.700]  to elect a governor and on that basis they start going overseas they're involved
[26:05.700 --> 26:10.460]  with the white washing of Nazis after World War two and then they start excuse
[26:10.460 --> 26:15.260]  me excuse me something about Nazis yeah yeah I'm afraid so it's always
[26:15.260 --> 26:19.180]  suspicious when someone talks about that stuff but it's not even yummy you
[26:19.180 --> 26:25.740]  mentioned Henry Ford you begin with this idea you know not only the God one of
[26:25.740 --> 26:29.980]  them to serve a powerful instead of the powerless but they began with this idea
[26:29.980 --> 26:33.220]  they're looking around the world in 1930s and they thought democracy was done
[26:33.220 --> 26:38.020]  they said democracy cannot compete with fascism and communism or communism was
[26:38.020 --> 26:42.060]  definitely not for them these are very wealthy businessmen and fascism
[26:42.060 --> 26:45.140]  fascism looks pretty good but they didn't like it where they didn't like
[26:45.140 --> 26:48.580]  Mussolini so they said what we're gonna do with such a totalitarianism for
[26:48.580 --> 26:51.940]  Christ which is sort of missing the point of the Christian message but that
[26:51.940 --> 26:56.140]  was their approach and they started recruiting a lot of American fascist
[26:56.140 --> 27:02.260]  empathizes and over the years have when they go and make alliances with born
[27:02.260 --> 27:05.780]  dictators they look for guys who exemplify that model does tell the leader
[27:05.780 --> 27:09.220]  of the group has said he likes the state of Congress and he says he was a free man
[27:09.220 --> 27:13.140]  in the 20th century who best understood the message of the New Testament and
[27:13.140 --> 27:17.620]  maybe you say something like Dietrich Bonhoeffer or Martin Luther King and
[27:17.620 --> 27:21.180]  maybe more conservative and he said Billy Graham he says no no no he says Hitler
[27:21.180 --> 27:25.860]  Stalin and Mao and he says what they understood is it the New Testament and
[27:25.860 --> 27:30.060]  this is their reading is not about love or mercy or injustice or forgiveness
[27:30.060 --> 27:34.220]  it's about power and those guys understood power so you want to exact you
[27:34.220 --> 27:38.100]  want to model yourself on power another sermon you can find actually online on
[27:38.100 --> 27:41.740]  the website of the navigators Christian right group they have an audio
[27:41.740 --> 27:46.900]  sermon of course saying because you know how Jesus said you got to put me before
[27:46.900 --> 27:50.580]  your mother father brother says well Hitler now that's what they taught the
[27:50.580 --> 27:55.020]  kids direct quote now even had the kids killing the parents but it wasn't
[27:55.020 --> 27:59.620]  murder because it was for building the new nation the new kingdom my god this
[27:59.620 --> 28:05.060]  guy hold on I mean this is incredible and you were there this is published
[28:05.060 --> 28:09.940]  it's in your book and I'm familiar with the fake right wing Chicago School of
[28:09.940 --> 28:14.780]  Business all of this Milton Friedman you know the same social
[28:14.780 --> 28:17.700]  without hands are real there's a real overlap with those guys because those
[28:17.700 --> 28:21.820]  guys are all going on this premise of what Plato called the noble life the
[28:21.820 --> 28:25.580]  idea that regular folks can handle the truth and some of these need to make
[28:25.580 --> 28:29.420]  decisions and that's why they like Machiavelli man but to see see it's all
[28:29.420 --> 28:33.140]  interconnected I didn't know they were in the Straussian I just knew it fit with
[28:33.140 --> 28:37.860]  the Chicago School man these people are just monstrous but but you know Obama
[28:37.860 --> 28:41.860]  has got a bunch of the Straussians pulling his strings
[28:41.860 --> 28:46.780]  family guys in there too general Jim Jones who's the you know one of his close
[28:46.780 --> 28:52.620]  advisors guy who's been on my god general James L. Jones the head of the
[28:52.620 --> 28:57.180]  head of the National Security Council the real government and I'll tell you
[28:57.180 --> 29:00.300]  one that's a little bit crazy she's not a member of the group she's what they
[29:00.300 --> 29:04.420]  call a friend of the group to me they're very careful about the distinction she
[29:04.420 --> 29:07.980]  says of Doug Moses man I was just quoting this language by Hitler and now
[29:07.980 --> 29:11.340]  she says he's a genuinely loving spiritual mentor and guy she says she
[29:11.340 --> 29:15.180]  turned to him when she first came to Washington 1994 who am I talking about
[29:15.180 --> 29:22.220]  but none other than Secretary of State Hillary Clinton so it's bipartisan
[29:22.220 --> 29:26.380]  hold on we got a break this is blowing me away we're new the full hour with you
[29:26.380 --> 29:30.380]  too long segments coming up that was a short one see the problem is I haven't
[29:30.380 --> 29:33.300]  read the book yet I've read a lot of your news articles a lot of what's in there
[29:33.300 --> 29:37.100]  I've confirmed separate places over the years so I know you're telling the truth
[29:37.100 --> 29:42.980]  once they admit you went there and live there so but it's just all these dots
[29:42.980 --> 29:48.340]  just connected and people kept asking me about cmp cmp cmp I didn't really know
[29:48.340 --> 29:55.660]  much about it now we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the

[31:11.020 --> 31:14.940]  and closer to the limits of our nation's power grid some say that this summer's
[31:14.940 --> 31:19.420]  demand for electrical power may finally push the grid over its edge creating a
[31:19.420 --> 31:23.940]  cascade of power outages across the country putting us all in the dark are

[33:19.380 --> 33:24.660]  I'm gonna be honest I'm gonna be honest with listeners a lot of times when I
[33:24.660 --> 33:29.820]  have a guest on I'm focused I've got notes I got a bunch of facts a few days
[33:29.820 --> 33:34.980]  ago I saw Mr. Charlotte on Rachel Maddow I was back in the break room drinking
[33:34.980 --> 33:39.140]  coffee and eating dinner up here working on a film and I said I've read his stuff
[33:39.140 --> 33:43.860]  before yeah I know about Ashcroft and all those guys in this group and I've
[33:43.860 --> 33:47.460]  been doing some more research on that I want to get him on but Maddow was
[33:47.460 --> 33:50.580]  making it a left-right thing and about how these guys are all cheating on their
[33:50.580 --> 33:54.820]  wives and how they're hypocrites and I was like I've read his articles and
[33:54.820 --> 33:58.820]  other articles about this group how it's all Machiavellian and he injustifies
[33:58.820 --> 34:04.180]  the means and dictators and strong men and I go man that fits into Chicago's
[34:04.180 --> 34:12.660]  school and the neocons and you know this whole sick philosophy that the
[34:12.660 --> 34:17.100]  globalists just kind of used to get well-meaning men to do evil things the
[34:17.100 --> 34:20.940]  higher-up psychopaths are using it as a control system and it's it's one of many
[34:20.940 --> 34:26.100]  groups but certainly then as he made the connections to even more powerful
[34:26.100 --> 34:29.860]  organizations and I guess there is something to this you know I don't get
[34:29.860 --> 34:33.340]  too obsessed on this group or that group I know I've found if it's CFR
[34:33.340 --> 34:39.140]  Trilateral Commission Bilderberg Bohemian Grove then it's every other group the
[34:39.140 --> 34:43.060]  leadership of these groups are the leadership of all the other groups and
[34:43.060 --> 34:47.780]  so it's kind of an interlocking director but I'll be honest now that I heard him
[34:47.780 --> 34:51.460]  roll with info I'd never heard him say on the shows because they always
[34:51.460 --> 34:57.340]  compartmentalize it it made all these connections because you've got other
[34:57.340 --> 35:01.780]  secretive right-wing groups like the CMP and I've had guests on over the years
[35:01.780 --> 35:04.940]  that mentioned that I thought of it more was a right-wing think tank that
[35:04.940 --> 35:09.060]  were globalist but it also had some anti-globalist in it like the Hunt
[35:09.060 --> 35:14.060]  Brothers so that confused me and I don't think anything's the top of the pyramid
[35:14.060 --> 35:18.420]  I think at the top of the pyramid it's all these groups nexus sing in but then
[35:18.420 --> 35:22.180]  I didn't know there was a opus-day connection I just threw it out there
[35:22.180 --> 35:26.420]  he said yes and listen to the names and then a Pentagon connection with the head
[35:26.420 --> 35:29.940]  of national security that's what's really is the real shadow government
[35:29.940 --> 35:37.620]  James L. Jones and the Chicago School and the neocons and so you just blew me
[35:37.620 --> 35:42.180]  away you just got my attention and so I want to get more in the opus-day
[35:42.180 --> 35:45.980]  connection more than national security connection take your time on Hillary as
[35:45.980 --> 35:50.860]  a friend take your time on their missions their operations what they're
[35:50.860 --> 35:54.140]  doing worldwide I know you covered on the book I've read part of it just down
[35:54.140 --> 35:58.660]  and already a best-seller the family Jeff Charlotte but Jeff go ahead run
[35:58.660 --> 36:04.140]  through it all give us the you know the key information here and bottom line
[36:04.140 --> 36:08.980]  just from knowing what I know about separate groups that nexus in this does
[36:08.980 --> 36:13.940]  sound pretty pretty sinister yeah I'm glad you're saying this out I think
[36:13.940 --> 36:17.460]  exactly right we never want to make a mistake if there's one group that controls
[36:17.460 --> 36:21.180]  at all there's multiple power bases and you know the point I'm trying to make
[36:21.180 --> 36:25.780]  here is the family is one of the most influential power bases and yet hasn't
[36:25.780 --> 36:30.060]  been measured a sociologist conservative sociologist actually as it happens down
[36:30.060 --> 36:36.220]  there in Texas at Rice University survey of 360 politicians and Washington
[36:36.220 --> 36:42.660]  asking them to name the the religious group that is most influential one in
[36:42.660 --> 36:47.540]  three name the family that's more than any other group got those more votes than
[36:47.540 --> 36:51.100]  James Dawson focus on the family more than any other group they name the
[36:51.100 --> 36:55.860]  family and what's crazy about this is the family denies that they exist if you
[36:55.860 --> 36:59.300]  call up the leader of the group as I had NBC News did last year where I did a
[36:59.300 --> 37:03.140]  segment with them and if you don't know there's nothing to see here we don't
[37:03.140 --> 37:06.420]  exist there's no group because the group of friends fortunately I had already
[37:06.420 --> 37:11.020]  shared with NBC News their their tax records and the 600 boxes of documents
[37:11.020 --> 37:16.020]  that show I think something that does indeed go beyond left and right this is
[37:16.020 --> 37:20.180]  a group about power you know again I just repeat that that saying that they
[37:20.180 --> 37:23.620]  have we work with power where we can build new power where we can't what that
[37:23.620 --> 37:28.340]  means is unlike some right-wing groups that are just sort of extension to the
[37:28.340 --> 37:33.020]  Republican Party the family wants connections to to Democrats as well one
[37:33.020 --> 37:40.820]  is a senator Mark Pire Arkansas pro-war Democrat from Arkansas and so they're
[37:40.820 --> 37:45.620]  apolitical they they want power political political I wouldn't say that
[37:45.620 --> 37:50.220]  they want power they are specific again one is they believe in sort of a free
[37:50.220 --> 37:55.180]  market fundamentalism they believe in political I meant I mean they don't care
[37:55.180 --> 37:59.260]  about labels they don't care about labels they care about power right they care
[37:59.260 --> 38:02.620]  about power in their agenda and then gender is two things it's free market
[38:02.620 --> 38:06.380]  fundamentalism and it's American Empire that's what they've been working on for
[38:06.380 --> 38:12.780]  70 years and I heard the lead in so you may appreciate this when back in 1945 the
[38:12.780 --> 38:16.340]  leader of the group Abraham Brady I believe coin the spray I believe he may
[38:16.340 --> 38:19.620]  been the first one to use it although I think you'll know if I'm wrong he said
[38:19.620 --> 38:26.860]  there's a coming new world order and he says wow 1945 has documented in their
[38:26.860 --> 38:31.860]  archives which anyone I don't think he coined it but the fact that he used it
[38:31.860 --> 38:37.100]  Hitler used it Hitler used it H.G. Wells wrote a book called the New World Order
[38:37.100 --> 38:43.500]  and yeah yeah he was he was an interesting admirer of Hitler basically
[38:43.500 --> 38:50.100]  they said what we're aiming for is a form of totalitarianism they said how
[38:50.100 --> 38:54.420]  about a fascist dictatorship yeah Hitler is one of the earliest you can't
[38:54.420 --> 39:00.100]  find right around the same time Hitler starts using it then H.G. Wells uses it
[39:00.100 --> 39:04.580]  but they both wanted different forms of socialism Hitler a more fascist form
[39:04.580 --> 39:08.100]  though they're supposedly on different ends of the spectrum national socialists
[39:08.100 --> 39:13.500]  the nonsense and then the Hitler wanted to have somebody kidnap and kill H.G. Wells
[39:13.500 --> 39:18.140]  so like you said there's competing there's competing factions but but to
[39:18.140 --> 39:23.340]  go ahead well I mean you know that's what the bottom line of the American
[39:23.340 --> 39:29.260]  Empire and in that's what led them into alliances you know we were talking
[39:29.260 --> 39:32.580]  before the break about their role in sort of whitewashing the records of
[39:32.580 --> 39:37.300]  former Nazis one with a guy named Herman J.S. was vice president of the German
[39:37.300 --> 39:41.340]  operation after the war became known as the Wizard of the West German miracle
[39:41.340 --> 39:46.500]  brilliant financier until it was discovered that before he was a
[39:46.500 --> 39:51.500]  Germany's banker he was the man known as Hitler's banker he in fact had helped
[39:51.500 --> 39:56.380]  speared away untold amounts of German money to the Nazis escaped to South
[39:56.380 --> 40:00.780]  America oh my so we have a Nazi connection with money coming over
[40:00.780 --> 40:05.500]  because we know the bushes with Prescott have that connection well there's more
[40:05.500 --> 40:08.460]  that is more than that they're the head of the Swiss operation after the war
[40:08.460 --> 40:12.580]  with a banker named Alfred Herz he is the family in its access to American
[40:12.580 --> 40:19.500]  politicians to come over and lobby for America to lay off all the money that of
[40:19.500 --> 40:24.580]  course they had stolen from other Swiss banks had stolen from the Jews who had
[40:24.580 --> 40:28.740]  been killed and then you know the so-called Nazi gold you know we forget
[40:28.740 --> 40:31.900]  that there were actually early attempts to investigate that stuff and Alfred Herz
[40:31.900 --> 40:36.740]  working to congress milling center out out into Wiley from Wisconsin others was
[40:36.740 --> 40:41.620]  able to lobby successfully using this group network that's really what this
[40:41.620 --> 40:45.460]  wait a minute this is the group that blocked the investigation of the rat
[40:45.460 --> 40:49.620]  line in the gold and diamonds a group you know I think you made an important
[40:49.620 --> 40:52.620]  point there's no single group in controlling all this stuff but there's
[40:52.620 --> 40:57.420]  lots of different power bases in Washington yes a swarm of viruses or
[40:57.420 --> 41:01.460]  something it's a whole bunch of them but going in the same direction more
[41:01.460 --> 41:05.340]  power more control specifically let's get more into that history but can you
[41:05.340 --> 41:09.500]  backtrack because I read your articles years ago and Harper's and Rolling Stone
[41:09.500 --> 41:13.700]  because I remember just reading this and then going and googling some of it and
[41:13.700 --> 41:16.340]  finding that you know you were telling the truth because it was so shocking
[41:16.340 --> 41:21.140]  about their philosophy and we don't care about abortion we want Jesus wants
[41:21.140 --> 41:25.980]  power we don't care about you know this and that we like Machiavelli I mean this
[41:25.980 --> 41:32.020]  sounds like a psycho cult masquerading as Christians well let me give you let me
[41:32.020 --> 41:36.420]  give you quote this is this is from the news and we had an athlete and we had a
[41:36.420 --> 41:40.380]  congressman talk they are talking about abortion it's not that they don't care
[41:40.380 --> 41:43.540]  about those issues the group tends to be pretty right wing conservative so they
[41:43.540 --> 41:47.660]  care this is not the bottom line the bottom line is American Empire but one
[41:47.660 --> 41:51.100]  time I was at the C Street house this is the house in Washington where they're
[41:51.100 --> 41:54.060]  providing below market housing for congressmen the public and then
[41:54.060 --> 41:57.820]  Democrats by the way this is a bipartisan thing it was bipartisan
[41:57.820 --> 42:02.780]  powerless you might say and I was there in Doug Coe the leader of the group was
[42:02.780 --> 42:07.700]  counseling congressman Todd T. Hart and Todd T. Hart had come in Todd T. Hart is
[42:07.700 --> 42:12.860]  not what you would call an enlightened man he said he was concerned that the
[42:12.860 --> 42:17.540]  Christian was losing the race with the Muslim and he sort of was this guy
[42:17.540 --> 42:21.700]  talking about this is crazy what he meant was he said that Muslims are having
[42:21.700 --> 42:26.380]  too many babies while Christians are not having enough so turns out T. Hart
[42:26.380 --> 42:29.940]  represents himself as an ardent form of abortion what he means is abortion for
[42:29.940 --> 42:33.740]  Christians he doesn't care if Muslims have abortions in fact he would like
[42:33.740 --> 42:37.740]  that when I'm listening to this is okay yeah I hear you talking about this
[42:37.740 --> 42:41.580]  abortion issue you know I sort of agree with you on that and that's fine but I
[42:41.580 --> 42:46.140]  want you to think bigger bigger what I want you to do is to think in terms of
[42:46.140 --> 42:51.300]  a covenant and describe the covenant as something that men or of power enter
[42:51.300 --> 42:56.540]  into secretly privately because of a publicly invisible but privately
[42:56.540 --> 42:59.940]  identifiable group of companions that's in their official documents is a
[42:59.940 --> 43:03.700]  covenant with a covenant you can do so much more you just think of men who had
[43:03.700 --> 43:07.460]  a covenant you just think of the mafia and then I'm just direct quoting here
[43:07.460 --> 43:11.700]  here there's examples of where he looks for his leadership lessons Hitler
[43:11.700 --> 43:17.020]  Pol Pot Osama bin Laden and Lenin so all we can see here is that he was an equal
[43:17.020 --> 43:23.820]  opportunity admirer of killer good Lord but again when you're saying all of this
[43:23.820 --> 43:28.540]  I'm thinking about the Straussian Economist and philosophers I'm thinking
[43:28.540 --> 43:34.420]  about the Chicago School the Rockefellers the Rockefellers similarly funded
[43:34.420 --> 43:37.980]  other schools of thought you ever run into Rockefeller foundations or
[43:37.980 --> 43:42.660]  Rockefeller money and yeah Rockefeller and many more but in the early days of
[43:42.660 --> 43:48.820]  the family you know the Rockefeller Foundation of course it's gone through a lot of different incarnations you know at one point it was a
[43:48.820 --> 43:54.020]  sense almost a fund for CIA money that's been documented pretty well and it's
[43:54.020 --> 43:59.340]  founded modern eugenics yeah yeah in the early days they were indeed giving the
[43:59.340 --> 44:02.180]  family which was then known as international Christian leadership they
[44:02.180 --> 44:09.380]  changed their name every few years they say to to avoid scrutiny basically but
[44:09.380 --> 44:13.220]  they give you some money to do that because I mean you really see all the
[44:13.220 --> 44:16.460]  titans of American commerce well you always have the Rockefellers I mean
[44:16.460 --> 44:20.260]  they discovered in cancer viruses Rockefellers setting up them I mean
[44:20.260 --> 44:23.940]  just the whole system set was set up by these people I see I didn't know that
[44:23.940 --> 44:26.500]  you're the expert of course they're involved it's kind of like you looked up
[44:26.500 --> 44:30.300]  a stone and that's where you find the bugs but look other key points I'm
[44:30.300 --> 44:34.700]  interrupting this just gets more insane is their power getting greater is it
[44:34.700 --> 44:42.340]  waning do you get threats I mean what is it like
[44:42.340 --> 44:45.580]  this is almost maybe the comic section of the book you know because I first
[44:45.580 --> 44:49.340]  written about this in Harper's so in the chapter nine of the book the family I
[44:49.340 --> 44:53.660]  talked about some of the early reactions one was the speaking engagement in
[44:53.660 --> 44:57.020]  Germany get over there turns out the whole speaking series is paid for by
[44:57.020 --> 45:00.740]  the US Embassy get off the plane my German host says you know there's a
[45:00.740 --> 45:04.300]  problem your ambassador says that he cannot pay for you because you are an
[45:04.300 --> 45:08.260]  enemy of Jesus this is this is the adaptive United States is saying this
[45:08.260 --> 45:12.100]  kind of thing who is it the guy named Dan Cote not the brightest bulb on the
[45:12.100 --> 45:17.700]  porch he considered Dan Quayle his mentor a guy so off the charts that when
[45:17.700 --> 45:21.580]  Bush proposed him for Secretary of Defense Cheney vetoed him as two
[45:21.580 --> 45:27.780]  fanatical you that's that kind of guy but there are even one other responses
[45:27.780 --> 45:33.460]  was a phone call again from one day the guy who's an executive for the oil
[45:33.460 --> 45:37.140]  company price former a very big international company involved in the
[45:37.140 --> 45:41.780]  stuff he's calling me from Angola he's just a fan of my work that great call
[45:41.780 --> 45:47.460]  from Angola from a fan of my work as we talked for a good long while it turns
[45:47.460 --> 45:51.300]  out he's a member of the family he's actually trying to recruit me back into
[45:51.300 --> 45:54.500]  it so I try and get some counter arguments I said what about the family's
[45:54.500 --> 45:58.540]  involvement in Indonesia and the dictator's the heart of killed 1.2 million
[45:58.540 --> 46:03.020]  of his own people and his only counter argument is that must be what God
[46:03.020 --> 46:08.420]  wanted for Indonesia 1.2 million people dead that was that was God's will truth
[46:08.420 --> 46:12.780]  is they're playing God that's what this whole power trips about yeah you know
[46:12.780 --> 46:16.580]  it was it was very well put to me by I didn't interview with someone from the
[46:16.580 --> 46:21.300]  Cato Institute which is a conservative think tank in Washington and they
[46:21.300 --> 46:23.980]  really believe in free markets and so I thought they weren't going to like the
[46:23.980 --> 46:27.540]  book but they look at me so these guys are talking about free markets there's
[46:27.540 --> 46:31.340]  nothing free about this is crony capitalism the phrase they use I thought
[46:31.340 --> 46:35.220]  was really just dead on with self-interest by proxy these guys get
[46:35.220 --> 46:38.060]  together in a small group that's what a prayer fell the foot senator and then
[46:38.060 --> 46:41.860]  we've been hearing about governor Sanford those guys that are coburned they
[46:41.860 --> 46:44.620]  get together in a prayer cell they don't actually read the Bible I've been there
[46:44.620 --> 46:47.900]  for these things they don't actually study the Bible one man will say you know
[46:47.900 --> 46:52.460]  I have a message from Jesus I think Jesus gave me a message for you and in the
[46:52.460 --> 46:56.660]  case of center infant and coburned the message seemed to be pay your mr. some
[46:56.660 --> 47:00.980]  harsh money to keep yourself out of the public eye but you know the one thing
[47:00.980 --> 47:04.140]  that's really important about that whole scandal you mentioned talking about on
[47:04.140 --> 47:08.060]  that oh and so on and folks on the text you know the Republican the more
[47:08.060 --> 47:11.580]  important thing is if I don't care about their sex games exactly the question is
[47:11.580 --> 47:14.540]  I don't want you to get in the fight with with Madel but why is the media
[47:14.540 --> 47:19.180]  always make it left right now is one of the very two people pushing the story
[47:19.180 --> 47:22.020]  and this story has been around for a while and I'm not
[47:22.020 --> 47:26.420]  someone makes it to Los Angeles Times to the year-long investigation 2002
[47:26.420 --> 47:30.700]  published their results incredible stuff linking the family to Central
[47:30.700 --> 47:34.460]  American Desquad all kinds of stuff expected you know waited for the pure
[47:34.460 --> 47:39.140]  to the pure surprise winning reporter did it not up Pete last year I did a
[47:39.140 --> 47:43.420]  segment with NBC Nightly News with Andrew Mitchell hosting and we had Hillary
[47:43.420 --> 47:47.820]  Clinton talking about her involvement we had video of Doug Koh talking about the
[47:47.820 --> 47:51.940]  great leadership example of the fellowship that he tries to promote it
[47:51.940 --> 47:57.300]  like that one enjoyed by Hitler, Himmler, and Göring and you know NBC thought they
[47:57.300 --> 48:01.740]  had the scoop of the campaign season not up Pete because our American political
[48:01.740 --> 48:06.500]  press they're religiously illiterate they don't know the question fast and you
[48:06.500 --> 48:12.740]  know Hitler was a freak I mean why why this obsession with
[48:12.740 --> 48:20.460]  Hitler? It's the most extreme I mean in some ways it's sort of it is literally
[48:20.460 --> 48:24.300]  idiotic you know at one point I asked someone that when I was living with
[48:24.300 --> 48:29.340]  a guy that I find this very troubling they said well it's not his end that
[48:29.340 --> 48:34.660]  we're interested in it's his methods and you just you just blown away by that
[48:34.660 --> 48:38.660]  but even that they- but somebody's behavior is the manifestation of who
[48:38.660 --> 48:43.940]  they are exactly exactly well and it was methods were absolutely horrific but
[48:43.940 --> 48:47.780]  they misunderstand those things they like to talk about they say look here's what
[48:47.780 --> 48:51.620]  Hitler did Hitler got together with a little group of friends in the back of a
[48:51.620 --> 48:55.300]  varying beer hall and working together just like you guys are gonna work
[48:55.300 --> 48:59.260]  together whether it's Senator Inson and Senator Colburn or two younger guys in the
[48:59.260 --> 49:01.900]  group just like you work together look what they were able to do they were
[49:01.900 --> 49:05.220]  able to take over the world. But that's the same below name.
[49:05.220 --> 49:11.260]  Hitler killed all his friends. Well Hitler also was this is mainline
[49:11.260 --> 49:15.820]  history was hired by German intelligence to set that group up to monitor
[49:15.820 --> 49:19.620]  people and then it got some British funding later from the King of England
[49:19.620 --> 49:25.140]  and were the eighth and so Hitler didn't just pop up out of a cabbage patch.
[49:25.140 --> 49:30.860]  Well the important thing to recognize with these guys is that they're all sort of power hungry
[49:30.860 --> 49:36.420]  political opportunists and I think that's what you get with the family. You know the thing about it is
[49:36.420 --> 49:41.300]  a lot of the young guys I live with even some of the congressmen I've spoken to they get involved
[49:41.300 --> 49:45.340]  with the best of intentions they really genuinely do I'll even say that a Senator Brown back.
[49:45.340 --> 49:56.820]  Yeah that's like congressmen going to Kim the head of the Washington Times Mr. Moon I mean total cult
[49:56.820 --> 50:01.060]  and they said we didn't know that this was going to be a crowning ceremony as him as the Messiah
[50:01.060 --> 50:07.660]  there they are embarrassed gulping as crowns are being put on his head how does that individual tie into all this.
[50:07.660 --> 50:15.580]  You know there's a big overlap there but that's yet again a distinct power base but there is that overlap
[50:15.580 --> 50:21.980]  and that example that you give we didn't know I think that's been in the news again I emphasize the bipartisan aspect of this.
[50:21.980 --> 50:28.860]  The congressman Bart Stupak of Michigan has been living for seven years in this house run by the family
[50:28.860 --> 50:36.660]  getting subsidized rent which is a gift which he should be reporting if he hasn't and when the Michigan press asked about this
[50:36.660 --> 50:44.460]  he said gee I didn't know I just walked by these foreign policy meetings in my dining room accepted this cheap rent
[50:44.460 --> 50:49.860]  and I never bothered to ask questions it's just not plausible to say you didn't know at that point.
[50:49.860 --> 50:57.860]  There's also a Bohemian Grove connection you know what Nixon said about that anyway sir stay there we're going to come right back
[50:57.860 --> 51:00.060]  and continue with other key points.
[51:00.060 --> 51:07.060]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history a terrorist act of war against this country.
[51:07.060 --> 51:11.060]  The enemy struck America on September 11th but who is the enemy?
[51:11.060 --> 51:12.060]  bin Laden.
[51:12.060 --> 51:13.060]  This is his M.O.
[51:13.060 --> 51:16.060]  We have to look to the Middle East we have to look to Osama bin Laden.
[51:16.060 --> 51:23.060]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[51:23.060 --> 51:30.060]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[51:30.060 --> 51:34.060]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[51:34.060 --> 51:53.060]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings in war games, the shadow government and much much more. Fabled Enemies. Get the DVD at infowars.com or see it in super high quality along with hundreds of other titles at prisonplanet.tv.
[51:53.060 --> 52:00.060]  Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists.
[52:00.060 --> 52:04.060]  Heart-related health problems affect millions of people each year.
[52:04.060 --> 52:08.060]  Maybe you're one of the many who suffer from issues related to angina pain.
[52:08.060 --> 52:14.060]  High blood pressure, congestive heart failure, unbalanced cholesterol, irregular heartbeat or clogged arteries.
[52:14.060 --> 52:21.060]  There is a solution that doesn't involve expensive prescription drugs that only mask the problem and leave you with horrible side effects.

[54:17.060 --> 54:18.060]  What do you see in your area?
[54:18.060 --> 54:20.060]  Troops from 14 nations involved.
[54:20.060 --> 54:22.060]  That's FEMA dot gov.
[54:22.060 --> 54:25.060]  More on the flu, fear mongering, all of this.
[54:25.060 --> 54:27.060]  But Jeff Charlotte, I've got to have him back up in the near future.
[54:27.060 --> 54:29.060]  JeffCharlotte dot com.
[54:29.060 --> 54:34.060]  Charlotte spelled S-H-A-R-L-E-T dot com.
[54:34.060 --> 54:37.060]  The book is, the family will put that up on screen.
[54:37.060 --> 54:46.060]  But here is Mr. Moon, son, young Moon, the head of the Mooneys, having crowns put on saying he's above Jesus.
[54:46.060 --> 54:50.060]  And I don't try to get in fights with all these religious groups and all this.
[54:50.060 --> 54:56.060]  It's just that when they try to get political power and have secretive agendas, they have to be discussed.
[54:56.060 --> 54:58.060]  And I expose everything here.
[54:58.060 --> 55:00.060]  That's all we're trying to do.
[55:00.060 --> 55:05.060]  And this is freakish, and there's nothing Christian about John Ashcroft and his Patriot Act and the rest of it.
[55:05.060 --> 55:12.060]  There's nothing liberal about Barack Obama hiring nothing but K Street Boys now and swearing he never would.
[55:12.060 --> 55:17.060]  But I want to come back in this final five-minute segment a few minutes and take two or three calls.
[55:17.060 --> 55:23.060]  But first, in the four or five minutes we have left in this segment, other key points you haven't told us about
[55:23.060 --> 55:27.060]  as you're giving us the dirt on these individuals.
[55:27.060 --> 55:34.060]  Well, you know, I think the really the biggest point that we want to look at is how the family is acting like a lobby.
[55:34.060 --> 55:38.060]  They're not registered as a lobby, but they're paying for travel for congressmen to go overseas.
[55:38.060 --> 55:46.060]  Senator Jim Inhofe of Oklahoma went on at least 20 missionary trips to Africa who paid for it.
[55:46.060 --> 55:50.060]  In that case, he actually finagled, he said he went on behalf of the family,
[55:50.060 --> 55:54.060]  promoting the political philosophy of Jesus as taught to him by Doug Crow.
[55:54.060 --> 55:57.060]  So it's a tax exempt lobby on top of it.
[55:57.060 --> 56:04.060]  In his case, he went even further, he actually got the Senate Armed Services Committee to pay for it, $187,000.
[56:04.060 --> 56:10.060]  He went to the president of Nigeria, State Department didn't want him to meet with him, went there.
[56:10.060 --> 56:12.060]  He got Senator Coburn going to Lebanon.
[56:12.060 --> 56:16.060]  This is a country that's had civil war between Christians and Muslims for a long, long time.
[56:16.060 --> 56:18.060]  They do not need this kind of interference.
[56:18.060 --> 56:22.060]  Senator Coburn went there and he said, you know what, on his official form,
[56:22.060 --> 56:25.060]  he's told by the family about one of their foundations, International Foundation.
[56:25.060 --> 56:31.060]  He says, I'm going to set up a confidential Christian prayer cells in the Lebanese government,
[56:31.060 --> 56:36.060]  just like the one he used to help cover up the political affairs of Senator Enfield.
[56:36.060 --> 56:38.060]  So the script is doing this stuff.
[56:38.060 --> 56:41.060]  And when we dig into their own history, we dig into their own archives.
[56:41.060 --> 56:45.060]  We don't have to accuse them or make any wild eyes, you know, claims and so on.
[56:45.060 --> 56:47.060]  We see an absolutely bloody history.
[56:47.060 --> 56:49.060]  And how are you getting into their archives?
[56:49.060 --> 56:54.060]  They dump 600 boxes of unorganized papers in the Billy Graham Center archives.
[56:54.060 --> 56:58.060]  And I went there, I was one of the very first people to start poking around
[56:58.060 --> 57:03.060]  and we're talking about budgets, memos, formal correspondence,
[57:03.060 --> 57:07.060]  even confidential government documents, a lot of stuff on congressional grounds.
[57:07.060 --> 57:09.060]  Why is it at the Billy Graham Center?
[57:09.060 --> 57:10.060]  Is he involved?
[57:10.060 --> 57:13.060]  Largely, but not too much.
[57:13.060 --> 57:14.060]  A little bit.
[57:14.060 --> 57:17.060]  I think he's got his own thing going.
[57:17.060 --> 57:20.060]  Billy Graham did help them set up this annual ritual,
[57:20.060 --> 57:24.060]  which has become sort of an annual lobbying festival called the National Prayer Breakfast.
[57:24.060 --> 57:26.060]  In Washington every year, everybody attends.
[57:26.060 --> 57:27.060]  The president attends.
[57:27.060 --> 57:28.060]  Congress attends.
[57:28.060 --> 57:31.060]  It's ostensibly ecumenical.
[57:31.060 --> 57:32.060]  Everybody is represented.
[57:32.060 --> 57:35.060]  Internal documents says anything could happen.
[57:35.060 --> 57:36.060]  Even the Koran could be read.
[57:36.060 --> 57:41.060]  And by that they meant the referring to the Saudi prince Bandar, who they invited to speak.
[57:41.060 --> 57:42.060]  He said, but Jesus is there.
[57:42.060 --> 57:44.060]  He is infiltrating the world.
[57:44.060 --> 57:50.060]  And by Jesus, of course, you just have to remember they're not talking about anything you ever learned in Sunday school.
[57:50.060 --> 57:53.060]  They're talking about the idea of American empire.
[57:53.060 --> 57:54.060]  They're talking about the idea.
[57:54.060 --> 57:56.060]  They're talking about the Hitler Jesus.
[57:56.060 --> 58:02.060]  Now, the Jesus of strength and power rather than the one of love and forgiveness.
[58:02.060 --> 58:03.060]  Yes.
[58:03.060 --> 58:11.060]  Well, look, obviously intelligence agencies love to use missionaries and groups like this.
[58:11.060 --> 58:15.060]  And as you said, the Rockefellers deeply involved in that.
[58:15.060 --> 58:18.060]  So this is obviously just one more powerful group in all of this.
[58:18.060 --> 58:22.060]  And I would imagine you would say even some of the people involved are doing so.
[58:22.060 --> 58:24.060]  They believe for good reasons.
[58:24.060 --> 58:32.060]  I think that's what it's for is to co-opt well-meaning Christian men to kind of warp their sense for the injustice.
[58:32.060 --> 58:35.060]  The means to then go carry out really bad stuff.
[58:35.060 --> 58:42.060]  But we'll get your take on that in 70 seconds and take a couple phone calls.
[58:42.060 --> 58:45.060]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[58:45.060 --> 59:14.060]  Visit GCNLive.com today.
[59:15.060 --> 59:41.060]  We'll see you next time.
[59:45.060 --> 59:52.060]  We'll see you next time.
[1:00:16.060 --> 1:00:25.060]  And for the rest of the hour, we're very honored to be joined by Harrison Hagan Schmidt, or Jack Schmidt.
[1:00:25.060 --> 1:00:32.060]  And he's an American geologist, former NASA astronaut, university professor, and a U.S. senator for one term.
[1:00:32.060 --> 1:00:37.060]  He is the last of the Apollo astronauts to arrive and set foot on the moon.
[1:00:37.060 --> 1:00:39.060]  And he took some of the most famous photos.
[1:00:39.060 --> 1:00:41.060]  The bio goes on and on.
[1:00:41.060 --> 1:00:44.060]  We'll talk about some of that while he's on with us.
[1:00:44.060 --> 1:00:57.060]  But the main reason he's on today, and I'm very honored to have him, is that he has been very outspoken, thank God, against global warming being man-made.
[1:00:57.060 --> 1:01:05.060]  We've had a lot of climatologists and a lot of, you know, researchers and sunspot experts in all these different fields.
[1:01:05.060 --> 1:01:14.060]  And 37,000 of them sent letters a few months ago to the House of Representatives, and they wouldn't even let them testify.
[1:01:14.060 --> 1:01:16.060]  The media ignored them.
[1:01:16.060 --> 1:01:21.060]  And then they used a few thousand scientists on the U.N. payroll to say, we've got to totally change our way of life.
[1:01:21.060 --> 1:01:23.060]  Carbon dioxide is a deadly poison.
[1:01:23.060 --> 1:01:25.060]  It's a national security issue.
[1:01:25.060 --> 1:01:36.060]  And astronaut Jack Schmidt has spoken out against that with his scientific training in PhD in geology from Harvard University and all his other scientific research.
[1:01:36.060 --> 1:01:38.060]  And the bio goes on and on.
[1:01:38.060 --> 1:01:44.060]  And he reportedly took the famous photo of the marble, you know, blue marble of the Earth from the moon.
[1:01:44.060 --> 1:01:46.060]  And so it's pretty neat to have him on.
[1:01:46.060 --> 1:01:48.060]  We're going to break in a few minutes, but let's go ahead introducing.
[1:01:48.060 --> 1:01:50.060]  It's great to have you on, Mr. Schmidt.
[1:01:50.060 --> 1:01:54.060]  It's my pleasure and privilege to be with you today.
[1:01:54.060 --> 1:01:57.060]  I was flattered to learn that you've actually heard of the show before.
[1:01:57.060 --> 1:01:59.060]  Oh, yeah.
[1:01:59.060 --> 1:02:02.060]  We try to keep track out here.
[1:02:02.060 --> 1:02:04.060]  Well, Mr. Schmidt, it's great to have you.
[1:02:04.060 --> 1:02:08.060]  Let's let's just launch into manmade global warming.
[1:02:08.060 --> 1:02:13.060]  I mean, they were growing grapes thousands of years ago in Britain, but they're not now.
[1:02:13.060 --> 1:02:20.060]  All the evidence shows it was it gets hotter and colder and Mars ice caps get smaller and then they get bigger.
[1:02:20.060 --> 1:02:21.060]  They're getting bigger again.
[1:02:21.060 --> 1:02:24.060]  Isn't it the sun or am I wrong?
[1:02:24.060 --> 1:02:27.060]  Well, all the evidence is that there's a solar connection.
[1:02:27.060 --> 1:02:35.060]  The amplification mechanism has not been determined by observation as yet,
[1:02:35.060 --> 1:02:41.060]  but the observations that scientists, who you might call field scientists,
[1:02:41.060 --> 1:02:47.060]  the people who actually look at what nature's doing rather than trying to model it,
[1:02:47.060 --> 1:02:56.060]  those observations clearly indicate, in my mind, and I think in thousands of other minds,
[1:02:56.060 --> 1:03:00.060]  that the ultimate connection is with the sun.
[1:03:00.060 --> 1:03:09.060]  Now, how small variations in solar irradiance are amplified into significant changes in ocean temperature,
[1:03:09.060 --> 1:03:16.060]  significant changes in atmospheric temperature, global cloud cover, and the like is still,
[1:03:16.060 --> 1:03:23.060]  I would have to say, in the realm of hypotheses rather than theory.
[1:03:23.060 --> 1:03:31.060]  However, there's a very good hypothesis and that is that the solar magnetic field that vary
[1:03:31.060 --> 1:03:37.060]  with solar irradiance that are really determining the flux of cosmic rays into the atmosphere
[1:03:37.060 --> 1:03:40.060]  and therefore the amount of clouds that form.
[1:03:40.060 --> 1:03:43.060]  And they're forming what? The nuclei.
[1:03:43.060 --> 1:03:53.060]  Yeah, they form that when they interact with molecules of oxygen and hydrogen in the Earth's atmosphere,
[1:03:53.060 --> 1:04:01.060]  you develop charged particles that then attract water vapor and become the nucleus for cloud formation.
[1:04:01.060 --> 1:04:06.060]  And when the sun is relatively inactive, for example, like it is right now,
[1:04:06.060 --> 1:04:12.060]  then the magnetic fields that protect us from cosmic rays are depressed.
[1:04:12.060 --> 1:04:17.060]  And you get more cosmic ray interaction with the atmosphere, more clouds,
[1:04:17.060 --> 1:04:22.060]  and therefore the clouds reflect more sunlight, and you end up with a cooling trend.
[1:04:22.060 --> 1:04:28.060]  And we've had that, as most people in the Northern Hemisphere at least now realize,
[1:04:28.060 --> 1:04:30.060]  we've had that for almost 10 years.
[1:04:30.060 --> 1:04:34.060]  You may have noted that there was a recent announcement that, I guess,
[1:04:34.060 --> 1:04:40.060]  it's Al Gore's home town in Tennessee has had its coldest year on record so far.
[1:04:40.060 --> 1:04:43.060]  There's been a lot of record, but not just that.
[1:04:43.060 --> 1:04:50.060]  Then the Al Gore people have been caught faking buoys and other weather stations,
[1:04:50.060 --> 1:04:53.060]  faking higher temperatures the last few years.
[1:04:53.060 --> 1:04:56.060]  Our guest is also the author of Return to the Moon.
[1:04:56.060 --> 1:04:59.060]  He's Harrison Schmidt. We're very honored to have him.
[1:04:59.060 --> 1:05:10.060]  He is an astronaut.
[1:05:30.060 --> 1:05:34.060]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[1:05:34.060 --> 1:05:39.060]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[1:05:39.060 --> 1:05:43.060]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science,
[1:05:43.060 --> 1:05:45.060]  a longtime sponsor of ours.

[1:08:02.140 --> 1:08:04.660]  Ease the T-Rex of political talk.
[1:08:04.660 --> 1:08:07.940]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[1:08:07.940 --> 1:08:16.940]  Well, we're really lucky today for the rest of the hour to have Dr.
[1:08:16.940 --> 1:08:23.940]  Harrison Schmitt, Jack Schmitt, American geologist, former NASA astronaut,
[1:08:23.940 --> 1:08:32.940]  university professor and former U.S. Senator, and he also, of course, walked on the moon on Apollo 17.
[1:08:32.940 --> 1:08:36.940]  And don't worry, we're going to talk about that before he leaves us today.
[1:08:36.940 --> 1:08:43.940]  But the big crisis at hand is the hoax, the manufactured crisis of global warming.
[1:08:43.940 --> 1:08:53.940]  And I have Club of Rome documents all that will go over it with him where they admit this is just their pretext to turn us into the Soviet Union and micromanage the entire carbon cycle.
[1:08:53.940 --> 1:08:58.940]  But I guess a lot of people out there aren't biologists or aren't geologists and don't understand this.
[1:08:58.940 --> 1:09:06.940]  But he's here with us today to go over the science of that because he's bravely, you get branded a heretic, come out against this hoax.
[1:09:06.940 --> 1:09:21.940]  And so, Dr. Schmitt, again, let's continue going into why you decided to go public and start talking about this whole carbon tax and the science behind supposed man-made global warming.
[1:09:21.940 --> 1:09:36.940]  Well, the primary reason that I and thousands of other observers of nature, if you will, I'm a field geologist, have become more active is twofold.
[1:09:36.940 --> 1:09:52.940]  So one is that we are concerned about the misuse of science and particularly the misuse of bottling of a very complex system called climate that is so complex that it really can't be done.
[1:09:52.940 --> 1:10:07.940]  In fact, there are many people who are experts in bottling astrophysicists and others that have said the same thing, Freeman Dyson, for example, that the climate system is just too complex to model.
[1:10:07.940 --> 1:10:21.940]  And when you get into it, you find that the many assumptions that are made in order to just make what they call the physics work are just invalid.
[1:10:21.940 --> 1:10:27.940]  And any tests that you make against those models, against reality, have so far indicated the models are wrong.
[1:10:27.940 --> 1:10:36.940]  And so many of us just feel that although they're called climate scientists, they're not using science in the right way and particularly bottling science in the right way.
[1:10:36.940 --> 1:10:47.940]  These models are very helpful in providing insights, but you should not base predictions of the future on these extremely complex models that are filled with assumptions.
[1:10:47.940 --> 1:10:52.940]  So that's number one we've been concerned about the misuse of science.
[1:10:52.940 --> 1:11:14.940]  But I think more fundamentally this misuse of science has led to politicians and ideologues to try to gain control of the American economy and indeed the global economy by sharing people.
[1:11:14.940 --> 1:11:25.940]  Now, the science is quite clear that there has been since 1660 about a half a degree warming every hundred years.
[1:11:25.940 --> 1:11:43.940]  That is a natural cycle that represents the Earth coming out of what was called the Lysage, an extremely cold period for the Earth back in the beginning about 1400.
[1:11:43.940 --> 1:11:56.940]  If you want to read some of the history of the American Revolutionary War, you will realize, like the book Sam Adams by McCullough, you realize how damn cold it was back then.
[1:11:56.940 --> 1:12:04.940]  And that was partly that we were just moving out of the little ice age very slowly and it was still very cold.
[1:12:04.940 --> 1:12:23.940]  And so the natural warming is clearly happening, but there is absolutely no observational evidence whatsoever that the increase in carbon dioxide that has been measured in the last 50 years has had anything to do with that.
[1:12:23.940 --> 1:12:30.940]  Primarily because the warming started before the Industrial Revolution ever began.
[1:12:30.940 --> 1:12:38.940]  Now, where is that carbon dioxide coming from? Well, it's probably coming mostly out of the oceans because the oceans are getting warmer.
[1:12:38.940 --> 1:12:53.940]  There's a lag in that process of the oceans giving up carbon dioxide as they warm, but nevertheless, and it can be a lag of a few centuries, but nevertheless, that's probably where most of that rise in CO2 is coming from.
[1:12:53.940 --> 1:13:06.940]  Well, we're talking to Harrison Smith, Dr. Harrison Smith, Jack Schmidt, one of the Apollo astronauts walked to the moon, took the most famous photo, one of the most famous photos ever of the moon and the little blue marble out there.
[1:13:06.940 --> 1:13:19.940]  We're going to talk about that later, but you're a doctor in this. I'm just one of you who studies and interviews scientists and people, but Al Gore got caught according to all the ice core samples and people that I've interviewed and seen on television.
[1:13:19.940 --> 1:13:32.940]  He put the two, the carbon dioxide going up with the warming when really the carbon dioxide comes after the warming. As you just said, that's from all the governments, all the universities, all the ocean studies, ice cores, correct?
[1:13:32.940 --> 1:13:48.940]  So that's more cooking the books and then they've also caught some of the top global warming supporters accidentally, and I put that in quotes, having false data from their weather stations and buoys jacking up numbers.
[1:13:48.940 --> 1:14:02.940]  So I just don't see how they say it's an open and shut case when the majority of scientists pulled out there say that it's completely natural and that manmade global warming is a fraud.
[1:14:02.940 --> 1:14:27.940]  Well, it is being used proactively, there's no question about it. And it's being used for political purposes and hopefully the American people have started to realize that. Certainly their surveys that indicate that the common sense of the American people on climate change is starting to take hold as it apparently is on healthcare revisions
[1:14:27.940 --> 1:14:37.940]  and the stimulus so-called stimulus package where there is a concerted effort in the new administration and the Congress that's supporting them.
[1:14:37.940 --> 1:14:53.940]  And what one might call a state-run media to support them, to move this country in directions that increase government control just about every major facet of our lives.
[1:14:53.940 --> 1:15:05.940]  Absolutely. You know, they wouldn't let anybody see 300 pages of the 1300 page bill till right when they voted on it. Now we have it. Home inspections, federal power to kick you out of your house if they want.
[1:15:05.940 --> 1:15:22.940]  Take over all the land. It allows 30 plus federal agencies to just levy taxes and fines outside Congress's power. It's kind of a letter of mark just being given to any agency or group to go out and piratically shake down the public.
[1:15:22.940 --> 1:15:40.940]  Well, it's not encouraging. Liberty is definitely threatened in this current political environment and we just, all of us who believe in Liberty are going to have to begin to take steps to counter it.
[1:15:40.940 --> 1:16:03.940]  And it's encouraging to see the governors and the legislators of a few states starting to push back in terms of gaining a founders' interpretation of the 10th Amendment, namely that amendment that leaves everything not enumerated in the Constitution to the authority of the private sector of the state.
[1:16:03.940 --> 1:16:19.940]  And so that is, I think, a very, very encouraging trend and I certainly hope that they'll continue in that direction to at least try to put the brakes on the legal brakes, the constitutional brakes, on what's happening.
[1:16:19.940 --> 1:16:33.940]  Well, I think you're right. I mean, the polls show you're right that people are finally, you know, they've gone from 60 plus percent a few years ago believing man, they global warming was this big threat and we were all dead and carbon dioxide was deadly poison and would kill you in seconds.
[1:16:33.940 --> 1:16:51.940]  So now realizing that it is a fraud and a hoax and just a new tax, now they've only got about 40 percent support and that's imploding quickly. But it seems like the federal government and as you said, the state controlled media, the big corporate media, they want this new tax, they want this control and they don't care.
[1:16:51.940 --> 1:16:54.940]  It looks like they're going to just ram it through maybe.
[1:16:54.940 --> 1:17:13.940]  Well, we'll see. There's a lot of resistance, there's pushback now and the August recess could help us as the common sense of the American people is put forward to their representatives and we'll just see how we come out of this particular period.
[1:17:13.940 --> 1:17:28.940]  You mentioned the corporate media. I would not necessarily blame it on being corporate media. It's just media that's in the tank for this change, socialistic change in our political system.
[1:17:28.940 --> 1:17:50.940]  And it's because just about everybody in the media now, reporters, analysts and otherwise, have come out of an elementary, secondary and college education that has been dominated by people who have less respect for liberty than you and I.
[1:17:50.940 --> 1:18:04.940]  Well, yes, sir. And we're talking to astronaut, Apollo astronaut, Dr. Schmidt. My point was Rex Tillerson and Exxon Mobile said, look, we've looked at this. This is just a tax on oil.
[1:18:04.940 --> 1:18:12.940]  This is a fraud. And then David Rockefeller, the majority owner at a board meeting, this was in the news, said, you're going to come out and say it's real.
[1:18:12.940 --> 1:18:24.940]  And so even Rex Tillerson came out and said, OK, it's real. So when you see the NFL and every other big organization pushing it when in the American football league is the National Football League is pushing it.
[1:18:24.940 --> 1:18:38.940]  We know the establishments behind it. Are you saying that that's just the incredible peer pressure and hype? Or is some scientists are saying this is the new global religion. This is the new organizing force.
[1:18:38.940 --> 1:18:53.940]  Well, it has certain characteristics of a religion in that there's a great amount of faith that the climate modelers have the right answer.
[1:18:53.940 --> 1:19:08.940]  But it is also, I think, related to a much longer term ideological battle that's been going on far before climate change came along.
[1:19:08.940 --> 1:19:35.940]  It's an ideological battle of those that believe that you should maximize human liberty under certain guidelines, such as our Constitution, and those who feel that you should give up human liberty for a variety of their particular ideological reasons.
[1:19:35.940 --> 1:19:41.940]  Well, I agree with you, Dr. Smith. We're about to break. We'll come back and get into some other issues as well, like health care with you.
[1:19:41.940 --> 1:19:49.940]  Then, of course, get into the moon itself and what it's like to be an astronaut has been off the planet.
[1:19:49.940 --> 1:19:54.940]  I guess you're amongst people who've been the farthest away from the earth of anybody else in the world.
[1:19:54.940 --> 1:20:00.940]  I know your mission was supposedly there the longest, right? If I'm not quoting that wrong.
[1:20:00.940 --> 1:20:06.940]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[1:20:06.940 --> 1:20:12.940]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[1:20:12.940 --> 1:20:19.940]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[1:20:19.940 --> 1:20:23.940]  Well, Obama's already fudging. He's fudged since day one of this election.
[1:20:23.940 --> 1:20:36.940]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement, a personality cultist who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[1:20:36.940 --> 1:20:40.940]  It's not about left to right. It's about a one-world government.
[1:20:40.940 --> 1:20:47.940]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[1:24:22.940 --> 1:24:31.940]  By John P. Holdren, the White House science czar, the guy that wants global warming taxes and to terraform the earth with particula to save us.
[1:24:31.940 --> 1:24:39.940]  I mean, this is wild stuff. I mean, here's the Wall Street Journal saying they want a chemtrailist. I mean, it's just, it's, it's, it's crazy.
[1:24:39.940 --> 1:24:46.940]  Sir, we were talking during the break, what do you like in this too, the saying, drug the water supply, sterilize the men and women?
[1:24:46.940 --> 1:24:57.940]  He says in this book, take all the children at birth and raise them in communal, commune buildings like communist China tried, but it failed.
[1:24:57.940 --> 1:25:07.940]  You say you're aware of some of this. They admit in this book they want to use global warming taxes as a cover for their communism.
[1:25:07.940 --> 1:25:33.940]  Well, I think that there are individuals holding them, apparently among them, who, in a very large number, who have taken the environmental movement and turned it into what previously was considered a communist movement.
[1:25:33.940 --> 1:25:45.940]  And that's just something that people of common sense are going to have to continue to counter and, and, and wake up enough so that they take, take control of their government again.
[1:25:45.940 --> 1:25:56.940]  It certainly is extremely important that the United States maintain itself as the beacon of liberty on this planet.
[1:25:56.940 --> 1:26:09.940]  There are all sorts of issues, spaces included in that, where if we are not taking a leadership role in preserving liberty, then it will disappear.
[1:26:09.940 --> 1:26:24.940]  Because other nations have so far tolerated a, a, a, a continued attack on liberty that has been going on now, certainly since the, the turn of their century.
[1:26:24.940 --> 1:26:27.940]  Well, doctor, you're obviously very well read.
[1:26:27.940 --> 1:26:30.940]  Turn of the last century, since the 1900s.
[1:26:30.940 --> 1:26:42.940]  Absolutely. But I mean, doctor, you're obviously very well read on just the current news. I'm sure you've seen the announcements where they're saying, oh, we're going to have a new bank of the world.
[1:26:42.940 --> 1:26:51.940]  You're going to pay your carbon taxes, a new world order. Al Gore called for a world government two weeks ago to quote, administer the environmental movement.
[1:26:51.940 --> 1:26:59.940]  I mean, clearly that's what Holdren says. He says, a planetary government to micro manage and reduce our numbers by at least 80%.
[1:26:59.940 --> 1:27:10.940]  What is your view on that? And when you were in government as a U.S. Senator, I mean, did you ever hear any talk like this or is this starting to gain steam now?
[1:27:10.940 --> 1:27:21.940]  I think it has been gaining steam now. You heard, you saw a little of it in my time in the Senate back in the late 70s and early 80s.
[1:27:21.940 --> 1:27:31.940]  Partisanship was beginning to really raise the ugly head more extensively than ever, at least in modern time.
[1:27:31.940 --> 1:27:51.940]  But it has clearly taken off in recent decades, I think primarily because of the capture of the government school system by the opponents of liberty.
[1:27:51.940 --> 1:28:07.940]  And that is, I think, the fundamental reason why we are today. Now, does that mean that common sense is totally disappeared from the American people due to the education and the elementary and secondary school system?
[1:28:07.940 --> 1:28:23.940]  I don't think so because you still see, particularly in current surveys, a great deal of common sense reappearing. But on the other hand, that has to be sufficient to take back control of the government.
[1:28:23.940 --> 1:28:42.940]  We let ourselves be lulled asleep in the last election cycle, the last two election cycles, until all of a sudden we have a president and a majority in both houses of Congress that think identically about these matters
[1:28:42.940 --> 1:28:49.940]  and are willing to try to force down our throat a further erosion of American liberty.
[1:28:49.940 --> 1:29:07.940]  I noticed, Dr. Smith, that even with the decimation of our government-run school system, I think the American people are showing human common sense and saying, hey, this isn't going to work.
[1:29:07.940 --> 1:29:16.940]  It never has, and it won't work in the future, and let's fix it. So we'll just have to continue to see if that common sense will prevail.
[1:29:16.940 --> 1:29:21.940]  Well, how obvious is it that all these other countries don't have to make carbon cuts?
[1:29:21.940 --> 1:29:34.940]  I mean, even if you believe in global warming and carbon dioxide's deadly, which is ridiculous, and they're trying to list it as a toxic waste, if we make the cuts, the businesses will just move to China and India and Mexico, and it'll boost carbon.
[1:29:34.940 --> 1:29:49.940]  I mean, it's just ridiculous any way you slice it. I want to get your take on that, Dr. Smith, Apollo astronaut on the other side, and we'll get into space, technology, should we go to the moon, go to Mars? What's next? Why haven't we gone back in 40 years? Stay with us.
[1:30:05.940 --> 1:30:14.940]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick, go to the doctor and buy their drugs? You don't have to cooperate. There is a solution.

[1:33:05.940 --> 1:33:14.940]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Central Standard Time. We're here. I come back Sundays. Abbreviated live show, 4 to 6 p.m. Central Standard Time.
[1:33:14.940 --> 1:33:23.940]  And parts of the show are reared on XM Radio and a lot of other AM and FM affiliates across the country. We're very thankful to all those great affiliates out there.
[1:33:23.940 --> 1:33:36.940]  We're talking to Harrison Hagan Schmidt or Jack Smith. He's an American geologist, former NASA astronaut, university professor and former U.S. Senator. He is the last of the Apollo astronauts to arrive and set foot on the moon.
[1:33:36.940 --> 1:33:44.940]  And he is also the first and so far only person to have walked on the moon who has never been a member of the United States Armed Forces.
[1:33:44.940 --> 1:33:55.940]  Neil Armstrong left military service and then it just goes through some of that trivia. And he's got a book, Return to the Moon, that's up on screen in the human settlement of space.
[1:33:55.940 --> 1:34:03.940]  Return to the Moon is the name of the book. You can find it in Amazon and bookstores everywhere. I've actually even seen it in the bookstore. I've even seen it in my dad's house.
[1:34:03.940 --> 1:34:19.940]  But the point is, write book, be sure and get that. Just modify one thing you said. I was the only non-military trained pilot to go to the moon.
[1:34:19.940 --> 1:34:30.940]  But I did receive outstanding training from the United States Air Force in jet aircraft and the United States Navy and helicopters. So I feel like I sort of had the best of all world.
[1:34:30.940 --> 1:34:38.940]  Well, there you go. I keep telling my guys, don't print me Wikipedia stuff because Wikipedia's got my name spelled wrong and half of it's not true about me.
[1:34:38.940 --> 1:34:51.940]  I hope your audience recognizes that Wikipedia has their biases as well. Trying to get anything in there to moderate their position on climate change is impossible.
[1:34:51.940 --> 1:34:54.940]  A number of people have tried to do it and it just doesn't happen.
[1:34:54.940 --> 1:35:00.940]  I was just joking too. It's actually not from Wikipedia. The guys are about to box me in the nose in there.
[1:35:00.940 --> 1:35:11.940]  Yeah, Wikipedia won't let you publish. I've talked to scientists who've tried. Any material, basically trying to debunk manmade global warming, in just one case I found.
[1:35:11.940 --> 1:35:20.940]  And it's just despicable because they're the first thing that comes up with almost any scientific inquiry. Have you noticed that, doctor?
[1:35:20.940 --> 1:35:30.940]  Yeah, even if Google's in that team as well, you know, the head of Google has a very close relationship with the president.
[1:35:30.940 --> 1:35:39.940]  I have seen that. Now, I want to get a little bit more into the environmental movement and then into the moon and the time we have left with you and also healthcare.
[1:35:39.940 --> 1:35:50.940]  But dealing with Holdren's book and all these other books written by people that just crammed the universities and academia and social planning.
[1:35:50.940 --> 1:35:59.940]  This talk about the world being overpopulated when the West is actually, as you know, has a huge decline in its actual indigenous numbers.
[1:35:59.940 --> 1:36:12.940]  And dealing with this whole eugenics movement, this whole idea of the super race. I can't think of anybody out there who would be the archetypal Superman if it isn't the astronauts.
[1:36:12.940 --> 1:36:21.940]  I mean, did they ever talk to you guys about this type of stuff or when you were in the U.S. Senate, you said it seems to be building more steam now.
[1:36:21.940 --> 1:36:30.940]  Holdren and these guys are talking about forced abortions. Just this whole move towards eugenics. Are you concerned about that?
[1:36:30.940 --> 1:36:49.940]  Well, I'm concerned about any movement that might have legs to it. But I really think it is more visible now because the people who think this way have gained power.
[1:36:49.940 --> 1:36:56.940]  It does not mean that they are going to be supported by the vast majority of the American people.
[1:36:56.940 --> 1:37:04.940]  I just think you have to continue as the founders did to put your faith in the people and in their common sense.
[1:37:04.940 --> 1:37:13.940]  Now, thanks to talk radio, they are getting some education that they would not have gotten otherwise.
[1:37:13.940 --> 1:37:29.940]  It is up to you guys to expand your market and to make sure that the American people overall begin to understand why their common sense is what they should rely on and not on what they are told by the national media, the state-run media, so to speak.
[1:37:29.940 --> 1:37:54.940]  Now, I think the whole trend really began with the fall of the Soviet Union because the great champion of the fall of liberty, namely communism, had to find some other place to go and they basically went into the environmental movement.
[1:37:54.940 --> 1:38:10.940]  Now, that's not to say there aren't major and significant environmental issues, particularly at the local level, but they converted environmental activism to a political movement and somewhat a religious movement.
[1:38:10.940 --> 1:38:23.940]  Really, what these are is parasites. They want to organize our lives, they want to run our lives. I'll never forget, back in the mid-90s, they were stealing farmers and ranchers' land in and around Austin in the name of environmentalism.
[1:38:23.940 --> 1:38:27.940]  They later built on it and sold it to themselves. They were just bank robbers, criminals.
[1:38:27.940 --> 1:38:42.940]  I remember being in a meeting with these city council advisors and I said, this isn't freedom and they said, everything's a planned economy. Somebody's got to do it. They really think it's their job to run our lives. How do we beat the forces of tyranny?
[1:38:42.940 --> 1:39:00.940]  Well, you have to do it by education and by reminding the American people that their basic common sense instincts are correct. Their own private property is important, their incomes are important and they should not transfer that to the government.
[1:39:00.940 --> 1:39:29.940]  Their first chance to express themselves politically is coming up in the next congressional election. You all and all of us have to try to mobilize the most massive turnout of people who reject this current approach and begin to turn it around and get back to what would be the basic fundamental principles of constitutional government
[1:39:29.940 --> 1:39:32.940]  that we were founded upon.
[1:39:32.940 --> 1:39:47.940]  Well, I noticed you mentioned the last few administrations being a problem and so I'm glad you're recognizing, obviously, that both parties are run by these special interests. Why would big, wealthy interests want to collectivize things?
[1:39:47.940 --> 1:39:58.940]  Is that because it creates monopolies, allows them to shut down their competition? I mean, it's not just a bunch of hippies and communists running around that are doing this. They've got a lot of powerful friends.
[1:39:58.940 --> 1:40:17.940]  Well, there's no question. There's a lot of money influenced in this process and I don't know what's motivating people who have basically been dependent on a free enterprise system to get where they are today.
[1:40:17.940 --> 1:40:43.940]  Clearly, small business, medium-sized business, the kind of business that I'm involved in in various ways, they do not operate that way. But there are, particularly in the media and entertainment world, major corporations who have bought into and believe that their future is going to be tied to, their economic future,
[1:40:43.940 --> 1:41:00.940]  tied to this approach to attacking liberty and to building a more socialistic approach to providing for the needs of the American people. That is a very dangerous trend. There's no question about it.
[1:41:00.940 --> 1:41:27.940]  I think it's even worse by the way we've allowed the Congress not only to become permanent fixtures, very few congressmen and senators, if they run for reelection, ever get defeated. And that's in large part because the federal election laws have been biased towards the incumbent.
[1:41:27.940 --> 1:41:46.940]  And now we've even seen that George Bush really made a major tactical error, but we've seen that the federal election law now permits an attack on political speech before each election by restricting independent advertising.
[1:41:46.940 --> 1:42:07.940]  Well, Dr. Schmidt, Apollo astronaut, Apollo 18 astronaut, I'm sure you've probably seen the Cyber Bullying Act and even that local newscast pushing it now. The press is that bad. The Hate Crimes Act, it now says if your speech causes someone to do something violent,
[1:42:07.940 --> 1:42:23.940]  even if you're not calling for violence, they're going to come arrest you. And now the FBI is fluttering around saying if somebody makes a comment on a message board that's yours, we may come after you for what they said. I mean, this is really happening to people I know.
[1:42:23.940 --> 1:42:40.940]  Well, that's why we've got to make a change of direction in the United States government, a drastic change. And as I say, the next election is a key turning point. The next two elections are particularly key.
[1:42:40.940 --> 1:42:53.940]  If the powers that are currently in Washington maintain their control through this next election, the next two elections, then I'm not sure how you turn it around.
[1:42:53.940 --> 1:43:08.940]  Okay, in the 16 minutes or so we have left of you, I want to shift gears now and get into the moon, return to the moon and has that really great other headline here about colonizing. In fact, guys, put that up on screen for the TV viewers.
[1:43:08.940 --> 1:43:11.940]  I don't think use that word. I think I use settling.
[1:43:11.940 --> 1:43:20.940]  Sure. That's why I wanted to put it up on the screen so I could actually, there it is, the human settlement of space, return to the moon. Tell us, tell us what that headline means for the book.
[1:43:20.940 --> 1:43:48.940]  Well, the moon is the nearest place in space where human beings can homestead. The resources are there to want to establish, settlements are established, the resources are there not only to support those settlements with the water and oxygen and food and other things that you need, independently of the earth.
[1:43:48.940 --> 1:44:09.940]  But there is one resource that's there that allows for an economy that can, through the export of that resource, to the earth. And that's the light isotope of helium called Helium-3, which is a nearly ideal fuel for fusion power generation.
[1:44:09.940 --> 1:44:27.940]  And so that's what the book is all about. It tries to put together, in a very, very broad way, the beginnings of a plan for the private sector to initiate the settlement of the moon and to provide the earth with a major new energy resource.
[1:44:27.940 --> 1:44:45.940]  Amazing. Now, just because your bio is so lengthy, in a nutshell, tell us about your career as a AAA astronaut, you know, lunar astronaut. Tell us about that. Tell us about the missions, just in a nutshell, then I've got some questions.
[1:44:45.940 --> 1:45:03.940]  Well, my career started as a geologist, the son of a geologist, actually, in southern New Mexico, Caltech train, and then a Harvard PhD. I did a lot of field work in Norway and Alaska.
[1:45:03.940 --> 1:45:20.940]  And when NASA and the National Academy of Sciences asked for volunteers for the first selection of scientist astronauts, I thought about 10 seconds and raised my hand, and I was figuring that if I didn't, I'd probably regret it, and I would have, obviously.
[1:45:20.940 --> 1:45:39.940]  But while at Harvard, I became increasingly concerned about the direction that Harvard trained public, so-called public service, were taking us, and figured that if I was that concerned that sometime in my life, I'd better think about getting into politics.
[1:45:39.940 --> 1:45:58.940]  That opportunity came after my astronaut career had essentially been completed, and I was elected the United States Senate. Six years there, learning a great deal about how sausage is made, more than most people would like to know, I think.
[1:45:58.940 --> 1:46:22.940]  And then in the middle of the depression of the recession of 1982, I lost my feet here in New Mexico and went into an accelerated learning experience in the private sector and free enterprise and business-related activity.
[1:46:22.940 --> 1:46:31.940]  Well, that's awesome. And again, the book is Return to the Moon, available everywhere. Harrison Smith is our guest. How many moon missions were you involved in in total?
[1:46:31.940 --> 1:46:41.940]  Well, I was involved in essentially all the moon missions, but I only flew on Apollo 17, the last of the Apollo series.
[1:46:41.940 --> 1:46:58.940]  My involvement in other missions was involved in faceted. I was primarily responsible for setting up the lunar science and field geological science training program for the pilot astronauts.
[1:46:58.940 --> 1:47:11.940]  I was responsible for overseeing for the astronaut office, the development of various scientific experiments, the development and storage of the decent stage of the lunar module.
[1:47:11.940 --> 1:47:21.940]  And you also, as I said, discovered a lot of the most important rocks. Which mission put that laser up that the University of Texas contacts for a few days?
[1:47:21.940 --> 1:47:31.940]  What was actually deployed on the moon three different times, the first one by Apollo 11, as a matter of fact, 40 years ago, was a reflector.
[1:47:31.940 --> 1:47:48.940]  And the various observatories now shoot that with those reflectors, the three of them, that were finally deployed with laser beams and have been able to very, very precisely determine...
[1:47:48.940 --> 1:47:53.940]  From the Earth to the Moon, as well as the motions of the continent.
[1:47:53.940 --> 1:47:59.940]  Alright, we're running down on time and you've agreed to come back on in the future on science issues. It's just amazing having you.
[1:47:59.940 --> 1:48:08.940]  But I will be broiled and skewered and drawn and quartered and hung and then tanned if I don't bring this up.
[1:48:08.940 --> 1:48:15.940]  Because we talk about hoaxes. We have this giant government hoax of global warming right now, clearly trying to get control.
[1:48:15.940 --> 1:48:26.940]  Now, before I ask this, I want to say I have a friend Raymond Teague who worked on the main mission control on repeated Apollo's, ran RCA cameras and then RCA cameras on Skylab.
[1:48:26.940 --> 1:48:34.940]  And I've known Raymond for 14 years and he says, the whole thing's real, none of it's faked, you know, the whole nine yards.
[1:48:34.940 --> 1:48:42.940]  And I know he's the real deal. I have other people I know being here in Texas who worked on the mission and they say, if there was any chicanery, then they were conning us too.
[1:48:42.940 --> 1:48:51.940]  And that's pretty darn hard to do. 40 years later, and I never really covered this issue, but I get calls every day, emails about it, TV shows everywhere.
[1:48:51.940 --> 1:49:02.940]  What is your take on the people more and more believing, I've seen polls as high as 30%, that aspects of the whole thing was faked?
[1:49:02.940 --> 1:49:12.940]  Well, I think in a serious vein, it is another reflection on the government-run school system. That system does not teach history.
[1:49:12.940 --> 1:49:22.940]  There are several generations now who have come through it that have had very little exposure to American history or world history in an objective way.
[1:49:22.940 --> 1:49:36.940]  And just right now, you have a population that has not learned the complexities that had to be dealt with in order to put human beings on the moon.
[1:49:36.940 --> 1:49:49.940]  Also, you have people who just for their own enjoyment, I guess, like to talk about conspiracy.
[1:49:49.940 --> 1:49:55.940]  And then finally, unfortunately, a lot of people don't trust their government anymore.
[1:49:55.940 --> 1:50:01.940]  But in a way that, I mean, that's a positive thing to not be totally trusting. The founder said that.
[1:50:01.940 --> 1:50:07.940]  I think a lot of it is so much government lying. People are so untrusting now they don't even trust me on a lot of issues.
[1:50:07.940 --> 1:50:13.940]  I mean, people don't trust their neighbors, and society does seem to be degenerating a bit.
[1:50:13.940 --> 1:50:21.940]  My only issue is that said that I know people that worked on the mission who say it was absolutely real, and you can watch famous films of them in Mission Control.
[1:50:21.940 --> 1:50:24.940]  People I know, they're not making it up.
[1:50:24.940 --> 1:50:33.940]  Pat, for a conspiracy like that to work, you would have to have a con 450,000 Americans.
[1:50:33.940 --> 1:50:35.940]  Because that's how many worked on the program.
[1:50:35.940 --> 1:50:48.940]  Look, people have to remember that when you have a population of the world as large as we have, a very, very micro percentage is still a significant number.
[1:50:48.940 --> 1:50:52.940]  And some of those people actually still believe the earth is black.
[1:50:52.940 --> 1:50:56.940]  So if a few of them want to believe that we didn't go to the moon, let them.
[1:50:56.940 --> 1:51:00.940]  It's not an issue that comes up in my presentation.
[1:51:00.940 --> 1:51:05.940]  Studies have shown that many people do not get the proper.
[1:51:05.940 --> 1:51:09.940]  Some flat arthers saying I'm covering up the fact that it's it's some Atlantean conspiracy.
[1:51:09.940 --> 1:51:13.940]  But the reason I mean, obviously, you know, this is this has been building.
[1:51:13.940 --> 1:51:19.940]  I would imagine you get asked that sometimes because there are issues that make people question.
[1:51:19.940 --> 1:51:22.940]  And so let me just throw a few of those out to you.
[1:51:22.940 --> 1:51:30.940]  Wait a minute, I think there are more important things to talk about, but just let me say that when I'm not talking to the public, I do not get that question.
[1:51:30.940 --> 1:51:33.940]  I only get that question from talk show hold.
[1:51:33.940 --> 1:51:37.940]  Okay, that's true.
[1:51:37.940 --> 1:51:40.940]  And so I think we ought to spend our time on more important issues.
[1:51:40.940 --> 1:51:42.940]  Okay, why haven't we?
[1:51:42.940 --> 1:51:46.940]  Why haven't we been back to the moon in 40 years?
[1:51:46.940 --> 1:52:02.940]  Well, that's a really long copy, but the most immediate is that even though George Bush, George W. Bush articulated a very good return to the moon and on beyond policy,
[1:52:02.940 --> 1:52:08.940]  neither his budget office or the Congress properly funded that.
[1:52:08.940 --> 1:52:10.940]  And it's been properly funded.
[1:52:10.940 --> 1:52:13.940]  We will be we would be well on our way as we speak.
[1:52:13.940 --> 1:52:20.940]  But in the absence of adequate funding, we have had to put schedules in order to keep the program alive.
[1:52:20.940 --> 1:52:33.940]  Now you have an administration that for all indication is not going to pursue a aggressive role for the United States in deep space.
[1:52:33.940 --> 1:52:39.940]  And they're going to lead that to the Chinese, potentially the Indians and the Japanese and maybe Europe.
[1:52:39.940 --> 1:52:43.940]  And that I think is an extraordinary mistake.
[1:52:43.940 --> 1:52:49.940]  It's a mistake in the long term as we could make a relative to protecting liberty here on this planet.
[1:52:49.940 --> 1:52:56.940]  You have non-democratic regimes dominant in deep space, dominant on the moon and elsewhere.
[1:52:56.940 --> 1:53:01.940]  Then it's going to be very, very difficult to continue to protect liberty on this planet.
[1:53:01.940 --> 1:53:11.940]  Sure. Have you heard of, I guess we're in the Senate around that time, Dr. Bob Bowman who worked on some of the Star Wars program before it was declassified in the early 80s.
[1:53:11.940 --> 1:53:20.940]  And he's saying, and he's told me, he said, look, Alex, not only is there a space program, but there's a lot of it you don't know about and I can't tell you about it.
[1:53:20.940 --> 1:53:25.940]  But he's mentioned a few things that have slipped out or been declassified, you know, the whole robotic program.
[1:53:25.940 --> 1:53:31.940]  And they admit that a lot of the shuttle's been military secret missions.
[1:53:31.940 --> 1:53:36.940]  No, it's not a lot. There have been a few Air Force missions.
[1:53:36.940 --> 1:53:44.940]  There are missions of the space shuttle in which there were some classified payloads, but you shouldn't have.
[1:53:44.940 --> 1:53:51.940]  All the shuttle flights, except with very few exceptions, have been purely civilian flights.
[1:53:51.940 --> 1:53:55.940]  Sure. You did a lot of the photography on the moon, didn't you?
[1:53:55.940 --> 1:54:01.940]  Oh, yeah. Well, both Gene Sternin and I had cameras and we took a lot of the pictures.
[1:54:01.940 --> 1:54:09.940]  I happen to be more active in taking pictures of the Earth as we went towards the moon.
[1:54:09.940 --> 1:54:12.940]  But you took the famous Blue Marble photo, didn't you?
[1:54:12.940 --> 1:54:17.940]  The full Earth that shows the continent of Africa and its entirety. Yeah, that's what I took.
[1:54:17.940 --> 1:54:20.940]  I was about 34,000 miles away from Earth when I spent that.
[1:54:20.940 --> 1:54:26.940]  Now, again, because people kill me if I don't ask, where are the stars?
[1:54:26.940 --> 1:54:30.940]  Is it because the Earth's so bright that it blots those out?
[1:54:30.940 --> 1:54:36.940]  Yes, it's the same problem you have on a sunny day here on Earth that's seen stars.
[1:54:36.940 --> 1:54:43.940]  Just too much light for a wonderful optical system we call our eyes to handle.
[1:54:43.940 --> 1:54:47.940]  The eyes are great, but they do not have what scientists call the dynamic range
[1:54:47.940 --> 1:54:51.940]  to see both the bright surfaces and stars.
[1:54:51.940 --> 1:54:57.940]  Well, that's like when the moon is up at night, you can't see stars anywhere around it, right?
[1:54:57.940 --> 1:55:05.940]  That's correct. Same thing. The moon just dominates the eye and the eye doesn't close down enough,
[1:55:05.940 --> 1:55:09.940]  doesn't close the iris enough to see the stars.
[1:55:09.940 --> 1:55:14.940]  Well, I know we've got advanced technologies and I know the A-bomb and the hydrogen bomb
[1:55:14.940 --> 1:55:20.940]  superconducting super colliders are real and I know that there are some space plane programs
[1:55:20.940 --> 1:55:25.940]  even if you say there aren't a Dr. Schmidt that are going on.
[1:55:25.940 --> 1:55:30.940]  And so that's why I believe in our potential and I want to believe we went to the moon
[1:55:30.940 --> 1:55:34.940]  and I believe you when you sit here. You sound very credible to me.
[1:55:34.940 --> 1:55:38.940]  You say you don't get asked this on the street. People are probably scared to ask you.
[1:55:38.940 --> 1:55:40.940]  I mean, I'm sure you've seen all over the news.
[1:55:40.940 --> 1:55:45.940]  No, no, no. The American people are never scared to ask anybody a question. Believe me.
[1:55:45.940 --> 1:55:49.940]  Well, I mean, certainly you know it's a big, I mean, it's becoming a bigger controversy
[1:55:49.940 --> 1:55:51.940]  and that's why I brought it up.
[1:55:51.940 --> 1:55:55.940]  I understand. You have to deal with it. Fortunately, I don't.
[1:55:55.940 --> 1:55:58.940]  Well, I mean, I know you're right about the global warming being a hoax
[1:55:58.940 --> 1:56:01.940]  and I mean, there's government and corporations engaging a hoax.
[1:56:01.940 --> 1:56:05.940]  So I think that's, I mean, how do we fix this crisis of confidence?
[1:56:05.940 --> 1:56:08.940]  Because it's even happening not just with the government.
[1:56:08.940 --> 1:56:13.940]  You know, it's happening with people in business now. How do we fix that?
[1:56:13.940 --> 1:56:20.940]  Well, I think you fix it by, again, people have common sense taking back control of their government
[1:56:20.940 --> 1:56:25.940]  and making them right and getting good people to run for office.
[1:56:25.940 --> 1:56:29.940]  I personally would like to see term limits, but you're never going to get the Congress to do it.
[1:56:29.940 --> 1:56:34.940]  That's something the states are going to have to do if we're ever going to have a constitutional amendment.
[1:56:34.940 --> 1:56:44.940]  The founders just didn't realize that their successors would make a career out of going into politics.
[1:56:44.940 --> 1:56:47.940]  It was not on their visible horizon.
[1:56:47.940 --> 1:56:49.940]  Sure. We only had about two and a half minutes left.
[1:56:49.940 --> 1:56:58.940]  Dr. Schmidt, one word to describe what it's like to be 400,000 miles away or less from the Earth.
[1:56:58.940 --> 1:57:02.940]  One word to describe standing on another planet.
[1:57:02.940 --> 1:57:04.940]  Privilege.
[1:57:04.940 --> 1:57:08.940]  I was greatly honored and privileged to have an opportunity to do it, as were all of my colleagues.
[1:57:08.940 --> 1:57:11.940]  We were just the tip of the spear.
[1:57:11.940 --> 1:57:20.940]  450,000 Americans tell that spear, and we just represented them on the moon, but they made it happen.
[1:57:20.940 --> 1:57:23.940]  And that is my last question on the issue, and then I won't ever bring it up to you again.
[1:57:23.940 --> 1:57:26.940]  I promise, if you join us again.
[1:57:26.940 --> 1:57:31.940]  How did the film make it back through the Van Allen radiation belt?
[1:57:31.940 --> 1:57:35.940]  Well, that belt doesn't have that much radiation.
[1:57:35.940 --> 1:57:41.940]  If it was going to damage the film, it would have damaged us.
[1:57:41.940 --> 1:57:48.940]  There is radiation there, and if you lingered in it over time, you could accumulate a dose that could be a problem.
[1:57:48.940 --> 1:57:54.940]  But we went through it so fast that there wasn't any significant dose on the film or on a...
[1:57:54.940 --> 1:57:57.940]  Well, you know what's neat? We're starting to see space terrorism.
[1:57:57.940 --> 1:58:02.940]  If they'd really give us a space program, some of us could live long enough to actually go to the moon.
[1:58:02.940 --> 1:58:06.940]  But pretty soon they'll say the moon doesn't exist, and maybe it's made out of cheese.
[1:58:06.940 --> 1:58:10.940]  Let me tell you, Mr. Schmidt, Dr. Schmidt, Return to the Moon, is the book.
[1:58:10.940 --> 1:58:15.940]  He's out there exposing global warming, as the fraud it is, Manmade Global Warming.
[1:58:15.940 --> 1:58:20.940]  Is there any websites to fire out, sir, or any other info?
[1:58:20.940 --> 1:58:28.940]  No, I think if people look at the book, Retrend to the Moon, they'll know what the future would be and how the...
[1:58:28.940 --> 1:58:34.940]  Yeah, I'd like to have you back up in the next few months to just talk about the book itself, and more about the moon.
[1:58:34.940 --> 1:58:39.940]  And thank you for entertaining those questions. Let me say bye to you here at the end.
[1:58:39.940 --> 1:58:41.940]  Retransmission...

[2:00:47.940 --> 2:00:53.940]  Let us now go to, who's up next here, John?
[2:00:53.940 --> 2:00:55.940]  Ronnie in Texas, you're on the air.
[2:00:55.940 --> 2:00:56.940]  Go ahead, Ronnie.
[2:00:56.940 --> 2:00:57.940]  Thank you, sir.
[2:00:57.940 --> 2:01:01.940]  I'd like to thank Gerald Salente for his ideas before he gets there.
[2:01:01.940 --> 2:01:03.940]  And I want to thank you for everything.
[2:01:03.940 --> 2:01:07.940]  Of course, you're getting to speak with your guest, Wayne Paul, with a special treat for me,
[2:01:07.940 --> 2:01:08.940]  but I forgot.
[2:01:08.940 --> 2:01:14.940]  I forgot to mention that the most important part of the program is that you have the
[2:01:14.940 --> 2:01:17.940]  granddaughter who approached me on the UT campus.
[2:01:17.940 --> 2:01:19.940]  I was carrying one of his signs as usual.
[2:01:19.940 --> 2:01:22.940]  And she again thanked me for campaigning for him.
[2:01:22.940 --> 2:01:26.940]  And she told me that she was, of course, delivered by him and then said,
[2:01:26.940 --> 2:01:27.940]  and I'm his granddaughter.
[2:01:27.940 --> 2:01:32.940]  So I've actually, and I don't know, like you, I think that it may be,
[2:01:32.940 --> 2:01:34.940]  maybe she told Dr. Paul about it.
[2:01:34.940 --> 2:01:39.940]  And like you, maybe I helped him to decide what to do.
[2:01:39.940 --> 2:01:44.940]  She told Dr. Paul about it and like you, maybe I helped him to decide to run again.
[2:01:44.940 --> 2:01:46.940]  That's just maybe a delusion on my part.
[2:01:46.940 --> 2:01:47.940]  But I just want to thank you.
[2:01:47.940 --> 2:01:49.940]  Well, you also know Ron Paul's for real.
[2:01:49.940 --> 2:01:55.940]  That's why Co and Telpro attack him and ask, and ask where's the campaign money and this
[2:01:55.940 --> 2:01:59.940]  and that when it's all under the Federal Election Commission public.
[2:01:59.940 --> 2:02:01.940]  Co and Telpro is now attacking We Are Change.
[2:02:01.940 --> 2:02:03.940]  We Are Change isn't centralized.
[2:02:03.940 --> 2:02:08.940]  It's just a name and idea that I promoted upfront and exploded worldwide.
[2:02:08.940 --> 2:02:10.940]  Cause the name was good.
[2:02:10.940 --> 2:02:14.940]  And they're trying to attack the New York chapter because openly on this show,
[2:02:14.940 --> 2:02:22.940]  you, the listeners, raise money for German talus who they ran the wheelchair into
[2:02:22.940 --> 2:02:24.940]  and set up and he was found not guilty.
[2:02:24.940 --> 2:02:26.940]  So they're trying to spend that.
[2:02:26.940 --> 2:02:32.940]  But again, it's not working and we're continuing to move forward and expose the
[2:02:32.940 --> 2:02:35.940]  New World Order and the globalist absolutely hate it.
[2:02:35.940 --> 2:02:37.940]  And we're going to bring him to justice.
[2:02:37.940 --> 2:02:40.940]  We love the nitpick on us all day, but we're not the New World Order.
[2:02:40.940 --> 2:02:46.940]  We're not the New World Order that is forcing you to pay taxes so they can use it
[2:02:46.940 --> 2:02:48.940]  to poison your water.
[2:02:48.940 --> 2:02:52.940]  And so the people are wise to that and we're going to bring down the globalist.
[2:02:52.940 --> 2:02:53.940]  Well, you're right, sir.
[2:02:53.940 --> 2:02:59.940]  Can I just say public quote from Dr. Paul is most recent American Free Press last paragraph.
[2:02:59.940 --> 2:03:03.940]  He said public outcry against the bank bailout to the government power grab known as
[2:03:03.940 --> 2:03:08.940]  Bruce, the spirit of liberty still lives and part of a celebration of independence.
[2:03:08.940 --> 2:03:12.940]  They should include a renewed determination to keep fighting a good fight for freedom.
[2:03:12.940 --> 2:03:15.940]  As long as the government continually seeks to take liberties away,
[2:03:15.940 --> 2:03:17.940]  patriots need to keep fighting.
[2:03:17.940 --> 2:03:18.940]  And that's the question.
[2:03:18.940 --> 2:03:18.940]  I hear you.
[2:03:18.940 --> 2:03:19.940]  I appreciate your call, Ronnie.
[2:03:19.940 --> 2:03:20.940]  I got to jump there.
[2:03:20.940 --> 2:03:21.940]  Travis in Illinois.
[2:03:21.940 --> 2:03:23.940]  Travis, go ahead.
[2:03:23.940 --> 2:03:24.940]  Hello.
[2:03:24.940 --> 2:03:26.940]  Yes, go ahead, Travis.
[2:03:26.940 --> 2:03:32.940]  I just want to let you know that your Obama deception is an awesome film.
[2:03:32.940 --> 2:03:36.940]  It's the only reason I know anything about any of this.
[2:03:36.940 --> 2:03:38.940]  It's how I got awakened, as you might want to say.
[2:03:38.940 --> 2:03:38.940]  Good.
[2:03:38.940 --> 2:03:38.940]  Good.
[2:03:38.940 --> 2:03:39.940]  So somebody woke you up.
[2:03:39.940 --> 2:03:42.940]  Did you see it on the Internet or somebody gave you a DVD?
[2:03:42.940 --> 2:03:47.940]  Actually, I saw it on the Internet while doing a English report on Obama.
[2:03:47.940 --> 2:03:52.940]  My teacher thought I was doing something, you know, because I liked him.
[2:03:52.940 --> 2:03:54.940]  He found that out quickly.
[2:03:54.940 --> 2:03:55.940]  Good.
[2:03:55.940 --> 2:03:56.940]  Pay it forward.
[2:03:56.940 --> 2:03:59.940]  Tell your whole email list about the Obama deception.
[2:03:59.940 --> 2:04:04.940]  The best one is the YouTube director's channel where the whole film's in one piece.
[2:04:04.940 --> 2:04:06.940]  That's the best quality for free.
[2:04:06.940 --> 2:04:08.940]  Get it out to everybody.
[2:04:08.940 --> 2:04:10.940]  I've been sending links everywhere.
[2:04:10.940 --> 2:04:11.940]  Good.
[2:04:11.940 --> 2:04:14.940]  I just have a couple things to say.
[2:04:14.940 --> 2:04:19.940]  You know what the Marisol is in the vaccinations, the mercury-based preservative.
[2:04:19.940 --> 2:04:22.940]  I found out it's also in contact solution.
[2:04:22.940 --> 2:04:23.940]  I didn't know if you know that.
[2:04:23.940 --> 2:04:24.940]  Some.
[2:04:24.940 --> 2:04:26.940]  It's been phased out of most, yes.
[2:04:26.940 --> 2:04:30.940]  Well, I know the one I was using did have it in the longest time.
[2:04:30.940 --> 2:04:31.940]  Balchen Loam?
[2:04:31.940 --> 2:04:32.940]  What?
[2:04:32.940 --> 2:04:34.940]  Balchen Loam.
[2:04:34.940 --> 2:04:40.940]  I believe it was the Walmart brand at the time was using it, but I couldn't figure out
[2:04:40.940 --> 2:04:46.940]  why my contacts were, or my eyes were so irritated and I switched to the Walgreens brand,
[2:04:46.940 --> 2:04:49.940]  which advertised the Marisol free.
[2:04:49.940 --> 2:04:52.940]  Look, look, I'm going to have to keep you on hold for when we go to calls with Gerald Salenter.
[2:04:52.940 --> 2:04:53.940]  You can just drop off.
[2:04:53.940 --> 2:04:54.940]  We're out of time.
[2:04:54.940 --> 2:04:55.940]  That's your choice.
[2:04:55.940 --> 2:04:57.940]  We'll be right back with Gerald Salente.
[2:04:57.940 --> 2:05:26.940]  Stay with us.
[2:05:27.940 --> 2:05:29.940]  We'll be right back with Gerald Salente.
[2:05:58.940 --> 2:05:59.940]  Hello, friends.
[2:05:59.940 --> 2:06:03.940]  This is Alex Jones, and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[2:06:03.940 --> 2:06:05.940]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[2:06:05.940 --> 2:06:11.940]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals
[2:06:11.940 --> 2:06:14.940]  in pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[2:06:14.940 --> 2:06:18.940]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental
[2:06:18.940 --> 2:06:19.940]  system diseases.
[2:06:19.940 --> 2:06:21.940]  Now, what are you going to do about it?
[2:06:21.940 --> 2:06:27.940]  The Acola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you
[2:06:27.940 --> 2:06:28.940]  and your family's drinking water.

[2:06:33.940 --> 2:06:39.940]  and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultra-violent light sterilization techniques.
[2:06:39.940 --> 2:06:40.940]  That's right.

[2:08:54.940 --> 2:09:02.940]  If you can't afford the DVD with the extras and the high quality to show your friends
[2:09:02.940 --> 2:09:04.940]  and family and make copies from them, that's fine.
[2:09:04.940 --> 2:09:06.940]  Just Google the Obama deception.
[2:09:06.940 --> 2:09:08.940]  Look for the third or fourth link down.
[2:09:08.940 --> 2:09:10.940]  That's the best version I found on YouTube.
[2:09:10.940 --> 2:09:12.940]  It's a director's channel.
[2:09:12.940 --> 2:09:14.940]  It's got about 3 million views.
[2:09:14.940 --> 2:09:16.940]  All total, it's over 20 million views online.
[2:09:16.940 --> 2:09:18.940]  And pass that link out to everybody.
[2:09:18.940 --> 2:09:21.940]  But again, get this, have this on your shelf.
[2:09:21.940 --> 2:09:23.940]  Show it to everybody.
[2:09:23.940 --> 2:09:26.940]  And it's like it's pressing it because we show everything he was going to do.
[2:09:26.940 --> 2:09:28.940]  This came out one month into him in office.
[2:09:28.940 --> 2:09:31.940]  And it's all chronicled in the Obama deception.
[2:09:31.940 --> 2:09:35.940]  Going now to Gerald Salente for the next 51 minutes.
[2:09:35.940 --> 2:09:40.940]  We'll take your calls at the bottom of the hour at 1-800-259-9231.
[2:09:40.940 --> 2:09:46.940]  Gerald Salente, you've got the floor, the mainstream media more than ever taking notice
[2:09:46.940 --> 2:09:52.940]  to all the shocking predictions you've made the last three years that are unfortunately coming true.
[2:09:52.940 --> 2:09:54.940]  Where is the economy?
[2:09:54.940 --> 2:09:56.940]  You say revolution's coming.
[2:09:56.940 --> 2:09:59.940]  The elite are stealing everything, even nailed down.
[2:09:59.940 --> 2:10:04.940]  Gerald Salente, chief of the Trends Orcast Institute there,
[2:10:04.940 --> 2:10:06.940]  Trends Research Institute, tell us what's happening.
[2:10:06.940 --> 2:10:09.940]  Well, let's just, we only stick by the facts, as you well know.
[2:10:09.940 --> 2:10:11.940]  And we're political atheists.
[2:10:11.940 --> 2:10:15.940]  We don't believe in this two-headed one-party system.
[2:10:15.940 --> 2:10:20.940]  We don't bow to politicians or genuine flecks at political altars.
[2:10:20.940 --> 2:10:22.940]  We only look at the facts.
[2:10:22.940 --> 2:10:29.940]  We just heard Vice President Biden last week, a week and a half ago, say that no one,
[2:10:29.940 --> 2:10:34.940]  the truth is we and everyone else misread the economy.
[2:10:34.940 --> 2:10:35.940]  That's his quote.
[2:10:35.940 --> 2:10:43.940]  Well, the truth is either he's ignorant and all of those PhDs and credentialed people in the White House are ignorant,
[2:10:43.940 --> 2:10:48.940]  or else they're so arrogant that they can only see outside the Beltway,
[2:10:48.940 --> 2:10:52.940]  or they can't see outside the Beltway and think that they're the only people who know anything,
[2:10:52.940 --> 2:10:54.940]  or else they're lying to us.
[2:10:54.940 --> 2:10:56.940]  Those are the only three options.
[2:10:56.940 --> 2:11:01.940]  Because the truth is, as you well know, we saw it and so did some others.
[2:11:01.940 --> 2:11:05.940]  And so all we're doing is we're looking at the facts, Alex.
[2:11:05.940 --> 2:11:13.940]  And the facts are that the Obama administration said that $787 billion bailout scheme
[2:11:13.940 --> 2:11:18.940]  was going to create 600,000 new jobs by this time.
[2:11:18.940 --> 2:11:27.940]  And they said that without the stimulus package, we would see unemployment at 8% in 2009
[2:11:27.940 --> 2:11:31.940]  and peak at 9% in 2010.
[2:11:31.940 --> 2:11:33.940]  That's what they said.
[2:11:33.940 --> 2:11:39.940]  Now we have unemployment already, official unemployment at 9.5%.
[2:11:39.940 --> 2:11:41.940]  So they're way off on that.
[2:11:41.940 --> 2:11:43.940]  How could they have any credibility?
[2:11:43.940 --> 2:11:49.940]  We've lost 2.5 million jobs since Obama has become president.
[2:11:49.940 --> 2:11:52.940]  And at very best, if you're going to be generous,
[2:11:52.940 --> 2:12:00.940]  they've spent 20% of the stimulus package and created at best 150,000 new jobs.
[2:12:00.940 --> 2:12:09.940]  So when you extrapolate this forward, the best they can do is come up with about 750,000 new jobs
[2:12:09.940 --> 2:12:18.940]  over 2.5 years whereby they said they were going to create between 3.5 and 4 million jobs.
[2:12:18.940 --> 2:12:28.940]  And to wit, we've already lost 7.2 million since this recession, quote, officially began.
[2:12:28.940 --> 2:12:35.940]  Gerald, I was looking at a USA Today finance Gallup poll
[2:12:35.940 --> 2:12:44.940]  and it showed how Obama got elected at an 83, 84, depending on which one of the graphs they've had several of these Gallup polls.
[2:12:44.940 --> 2:12:48.940]  And now he's dropped below 50s, but in some demographics below 50.
[2:12:48.940 --> 2:12:58.940]  That is a faster, steeper, further decline than the previous grand champion loser,
[2:12:58.940 --> 2:13:04.940]  the peanut farmer from Georgia back in the 70s, Jimmy Carter.
[2:13:04.940 --> 2:13:09.940]  And so the bigger the hype, the bigger they are, the harder they fall,
[2:13:09.940 --> 2:13:13.940]  people are finding out it was total betrayal, total crap.
[2:13:13.940 --> 2:13:18.940]  George Bush after Jimmy Carter and Obama is the third fastest to fall,
[2:13:18.940 --> 2:13:25.940]  but luckily a magic crisis popped up nine months in to kind of boost Bush for a while.
[2:13:25.940 --> 2:13:32.940]  But minus a stage crisis or provocation or war, Obama is a political dead duck
[2:13:32.940 --> 2:13:37.940]  and his entire agenda to seize America is failing.
[2:13:37.940 --> 2:13:40.940]  But does he have an ace up his sleeve?
[2:13:40.940 --> 2:13:45.940]  Is it the crisis is going to be so bad we all can only swim to the life raft of the federal government,
[2:13:45.940 --> 2:13:50.940]  even if it's a desert island covered with government zombies?
[2:13:50.940 --> 2:13:52.940]  Or is it a new war?
[2:13:52.940 --> 2:13:54.940]  Is it a stage terror attack?
[2:13:54.940 --> 2:14:01.940]  I mean, if he's in total free fall, the worst in the last 100 years of polling with presidents, what does this mean?
[2:14:01.940 --> 2:14:07.940]  You know, I think you're one of the most astute people out there talking about this in the way that you're talking about it,
[2:14:07.940 --> 2:14:10.940]  because we saw the exact same things as well.
[2:14:10.940 --> 2:14:16.940]  And that when you look at the free fall that he's had in the polls and you compare it as to Carter,
[2:14:16.940 --> 2:14:22.940]  and then Bush was one percentage point higher, summer came, Bush was down in the dumps,
[2:14:22.940 --> 2:14:29.940]  people were making fun of him for taking a month-long vacation to Corofa, Texas, as the economy was sinking.
[2:14:29.940 --> 2:14:36.940]  Remember, we were just being hit by the dot-com bubble burst, and all of a sudden there was 9-11.
[2:14:36.940 --> 2:14:42.940]  So these people come up with schemes undreamed of, or things can just happen.
[2:14:42.940 --> 2:14:49.940]  One of the things that we're watching very closely is that the Obama administration is held back
[2:14:49.940 --> 2:14:54.940]  in releasing budget projections that were supposed to come out within a week.
[2:14:54.940 --> 2:15:01.940]  And now they're going to come out with them after, after Congress takes its recess in August.
[2:15:01.940 --> 2:15:03.940]  That's a big signal to us.
[2:15:03.940 --> 2:15:10.940]  So we're looking at that very, very closely, because they may be the shock of our lifetime in those numbers.
[2:15:10.940 --> 2:15:13.940]  No one's talking anymore about the green shoots.
[2:15:13.940 --> 2:15:15.940]  Remember that load of malarkey?
[2:15:15.940 --> 2:15:17.940]  That they were spreading around?
[2:15:17.940 --> 2:15:21.940]  That money manure that was supposed to be pushing up the economy?
[2:15:21.940 --> 2:15:24.940]  So that's the kind of thing that we're looking for.
[2:15:24.940 --> 2:15:25.940]  Anything can happen.
[2:15:25.940 --> 2:15:28.940]  They come up with schemes undreamed of.
[2:15:28.940 --> 2:15:38.940]  But the reality is, in the final sense, is that, as we've been saying, the world is going to call it the greatest of depression.
[2:15:38.940 --> 2:15:42.940]  In America, it's going to be called Obama dead.
[2:15:42.940 --> 2:15:47.940]  The schemes that they've come up with, these bailouts, buyouts, rescue packages,
[2:15:47.940 --> 2:15:53.940]  us owning corrupt country companies like Citigroup and General Motors.
[2:15:53.940 --> 2:15:54.940]  I love it.
[2:15:54.940 --> 2:16:00.940]  General Motors, they brought back this guy Lutz, who is the vice chairman of General Motors.
[2:16:00.940 --> 2:16:11.940]  This is a genius, Alex, that came out in 2005, 2006, that said that anyone that thinks that high gasoline prices are going to hurt the sales of SUVs
[2:16:11.940 --> 2:16:13.940]  doesn't know what they're talking about.
[2:16:13.940 --> 2:16:16.940]  This is a champion they brought back now.
[2:16:16.940 --> 2:16:19.940]  Look what's going on with the Goldman Sachs gang.
[2:16:19.940 --> 2:16:25.940]  I've said this, and I'll say it again, and I've said it before, and I'll repeat it over and over again.
[2:16:25.940 --> 2:16:27.940]  I'm of Italian descent.
[2:16:27.940 --> 2:16:31.940]  I've heard enough mafia stories for the rest of my life.
[2:16:31.940 --> 2:16:45.940]  If the names on Wall Street were Salenti, Caruso, Mondavi, Rossini, Puccini, Abbottelli, Puccio, they'd call it the mafia.
[2:16:45.940 --> 2:16:52.940]  It would be major news every day how the mafia is ripping off the country.
[2:16:52.940 --> 2:16:58.940]  We just gave these guys how many billions of dollars, and now they're giving it back to themselves in bonuses.
[2:16:58.940 --> 2:17:04.940]  It would be a big story, but you can't call the white shoe boys criminals.
[2:17:04.940 --> 2:17:14.940]  You could call them these Ponzi schemes they talk about, but credit swap, fault derivatives and collateral CBOs and SIVs.
[2:17:14.940 --> 2:17:18.940]  They're not calling them rather than exotic financial instruments.
[2:17:18.940 --> 2:17:23.940]  How about calling them Ponzi schemes?
[2:17:23.940 --> 2:17:27.940]  Well, I mean, Gerald Salenti, there you are.
[2:17:27.940 --> 2:17:29.940]  I'm sure you've seen all these clips.
[2:17:29.940 --> 2:17:34.940]  Paulson last week, the congressman were asking him, where's the 200 million you got personally?
[2:17:34.940 --> 2:17:36.940]  Is that not a conflict of interest?
[2:17:36.940 --> 2:17:43.940]  And how all the regulators were former Goldman Sachs, and he just said, no, it's no conflict of interest.
[2:17:43.940 --> 2:17:56.940]  We were talking before you came on live about the shockiness of actually watching 23.7 trillion stolen in 10 months greater than the GDP times two.
[2:17:56.940 --> 2:17:59.940]  I mean, I feel like I'm in a dream here, Gerald.
[2:17:59.940 --> 2:18:05.940]  Well, you know, we're writing now, we're writing the Autumn Trends Journal, and this is the way we began it.
[2:18:05.940 --> 2:18:11.940]  And we were writing back from the year 2012, we're looking to 2009.
[2:18:11.940 --> 2:18:16.940]  The greatest crime wave ever to hit America was sweeping across the nation.
[2:18:16.940 --> 2:18:22.940]  More lawless than the Wild West, better organized than Gangland, Chicago.
[2:18:22.940 --> 2:18:31.940]  A ruthless mob of financial bandits and political wise guys had taken control of the United States of America.
[2:18:31.940 --> 2:18:37.940]  Not a week went by without Wall Street and Washington committing world-class crimes,
[2:18:37.940 --> 2:18:40.940]  but all carried out under the cover of law.
[2:18:40.940 --> 2:18:48.940]  If perpetrated by individuals, it would have been called robbery, extortion, embezzlement and fraud.
[2:18:48.940 --> 2:18:53.940]  And the perpetrators would have been indicted, holed into court and brought to justice.
[2:18:53.940 --> 2:19:02.940]  But because politicians and financiers were committing the crimes, it was just called legislation.
[2:19:02.940 --> 2:19:06.940]  Unbelievable. And it seems to be a bottomless pit.
[2:19:06.940 --> 2:19:12.940]  I mean, they're seizing the entire economy, manufacturing, the carbon tax.
[2:19:12.940 --> 2:19:15.940]  Where does it end?
[2:19:15.940 --> 2:19:17.940]  Well, here's the way we're looking at it.
[2:19:17.940 --> 2:19:19.940]  As you know, we keep repeating it.
[2:19:19.940 --> 2:19:25.940]  It's worth repeating because it doesn't seem to hit a lot of people in the head the right way.
[2:19:25.940 --> 2:19:30.940]  You can't print phantom money out of thin air back by nothing, producing practically nothing.
[2:19:30.940 --> 2:19:34.940]  We're now looking at the dollar taking another hit against the basket of currencies.
[2:19:34.940 --> 2:19:37.940]  Gold prices are back on the rise.
[2:19:37.940 --> 2:19:40.940]  We heard from China, Russia, India, Brazil.
[2:19:40.940 --> 2:19:43.940]  They all want to bail out of the box.
[2:19:43.940 --> 2:19:45.940]  So where is it going?
[2:19:45.940 --> 2:19:47.940]  The decline of Empire America.
[2:19:47.940 --> 2:19:50.940]  Joe Salente, Trends Research.
[2:19:50.940 --> 2:19:53.940]  We'll give you the website when we get back, listeners.
[2:19:53.940 --> 2:19:55.940]  Will they be able to pump it up one more time?
[2:19:55.940 --> 2:19:57.940]  Or is this the big one?
[2:19:57.940 --> 2:19:58.940]  Is this the big inflosion?
[2:19:58.940 --> 2:20:00.940]  Stay with us.
[2:20:00.940 --> 2:20:07.940]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[2:20:07.940 --> 2:20:09.940]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[2:20:09.940 --> 2:20:11.940]  But who is the enemy?
[2:20:11.940 --> 2:20:12.940]  Bin Laden.
[2:20:12.940 --> 2:20:13.940]  This is his MO.
[2:20:13.940 --> 2:20:14.940]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[2:20:14.940 --> 2:20:16.940]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[2:20:16.940 --> 2:20:23.940]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[2:20:23.940 --> 2:20:30.940]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[2:20:30.940 --> 2:20:34.940]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[2:20:34.940 --> 2:20:41.940]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers' ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network,
[2:20:41.940 --> 2:20:44.940]  warnings in war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[2:20:44.940 --> 2:20:45.940]  Fabled Enemies.
[2:20:45.940 --> 2:20:48.940]  Get the DVD at infowars.com.

[2:20:53.940 --> 2:21:00.940]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[2:21:00.940 --> 2:21:07.940]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[2:21:07.940 --> 2:21:12.940]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical,
[2:21:12.940 --> 2:21:15.940]  many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[2:21:15.940 --> 2:21:19.940]  This is a flaw for the enterprise, or as our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note,
[2:21:19.940 --> 2:21:23.940]  forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes.
[2:21:23.940 --> 2:21:28.940]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[2:21:28.940 --> 2:21:33.940]  Congressman Ron Paul states, it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[2:21:33.940 --> 2:21:37.940]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[2:21:37.940 --> 2:21:39.940]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.

[2:22:17.940 --> 2:22:29.940]  The way of detoxifying can easily remove heavy metals and contaminants.
[2:22:29.940 --> 2:22:33.940]  Liquid zeolite is a tasteless and odorless liquid that when taken daily,
[2:22:33.940 --> 2:22:37.940]  supports a healthy, happy, and active lifestyle in an increasingly toxic world.
[2:22:37.940 --> 2:22:41.940]  And liquid zeolite is so gentle that you won't even know you're taking it.

[2:22:59.940 --> 2:23:00.940]  Hi, Ed Schultz here.

[2:23:56.940 --> 2:24:23.940]  It cleans anything.
[2:24:23.940 --> 2:24:42.940]  When you say this is the greatest heist in history, I don't think people understand.
[2:24:42.940 --> 2:24:44.940]  You really mean that.
[2:24:44.940 --> 2:24:51.940]  $23.7 trillion, and they're grabbing every sector of the economy and the green tax.
[2:24:51.940 --> 2:24:53.940]  The carbon tax allows the bureaucracy.
[2:24:53.940 --> 2:24:55.940]  I have the bill that they passed in secret.
[2:24:55.940 --> 2:25:05.940]  Now, public, as you know, I want your take on that, allows federal agencies to raise taxes on toilet paper, beef, everything.
[2:25:05.940 --> 2:25:07.940]  I mean, this is government becoming God.
[2:25:07.940 --> 2:25:09.940]  You call that fascism, don't you?
[2:25:09.940 --> 2:25:10.940]  Go ahead.
[2:25:10.940 --> 2:25:17.940]  Well, the merger of state and corporate powers, according to Mussolini, is called fascism.
[2:25:17.940 --> 2:25:23.940]  So if it quacks like a duck and walks like a duck, let's call it a spade, a spade.
[2:25:23.940 --> 2:25:24.940]  It's fascism.
[2:25:24.940 --> 2:25:33.940]  And to pick up on the second part of what you were saying, and I was saying, was that first they went through this whole scheme of the money printing.
[2:25:33.940 --> 2:25:43.940]  Well, that's going to run out, as we're seeing now, with the diving of the dollar and other currencies looking for, other countries looking for new reserve currency.
[2:25:43.940 --> 2:25:48.940]  So the next scheme is to tax the people to death.
[2:25:48.940 --> 2:25:53.940]  And whether it's hassle, taxes, again, current events form future trends.
[2:25:53.940 --> 2:25:55.940]  Pick up today's USA Today.
[2:25:55.940 --> 2:26:00.940]  Look at the parking tax ticket numbers that they're putting out there.
[2:26:00.940 --> 2:26:03.940]  Well, if you Jaywalk, they'll give you a ticket.
[2:26:03.940 --> 2:26:07.940]  Spit on the street, but rob the country blind.
[2:26:07.940 --> 2:26:12.940]  You can get an award for it, or they'll make you a treasury secretary.
[2:26:12.940 --> 2:26:20.940]  So the scheme, Alex, is after the printing game runs out, it's the tax to death game.
[2:26:20.940 --> 2:26:27.940]  And this whole thing, this whole notion of too big to fail, who came up with that one?
[2:26:27.940 --> 2:26:31.940]  I can say with full authority that their mother's not better than mine.
[2:26:31.940 --> 2:26:34.940]  What would happen if they failed?
[2:26:34.940 --> 2:26:36.940]  No one's ever told us.
[2:26:36.940 --> 2:26:44.940]  But yet we hear from Henry the Don Paulson at the last House Oversight meeting saying, quote,
[2:26:44.940 --> 2:26:53.940]  Our responses were not perfect, but I am confident that they were substantially correct
[2:26:53.940 --> 2:26:57.940]  and that they saved this country from great peril.
[2:26:57.940 --> 2:26:59.940]  Well, look at how this psychology works.
[2:26:59.940 --> 2:27:02.940]  They can rape, they can steal, they can steal trillions.
[2:27:02.940 --> 2:27:06.940]  They engineered the crisis on record, and then they're the savior.
[2:27:06.940 --> 2:27:12.940]  And if you don't give them what they want, they'll declare martial law as Paulson threatened last year.
[2:27:12.940 --> 2:27:17.940]  Now there's been articles in the news, as you know, Gerald, saying how good it was he threatened martial law
[2:27:17.940 --> 2:27:22.940]  and how he's above the law and how the private Federal Reserve is above the law.
[2:27:22.940 --> 2:27:29.940]  The President isn't, the Congress isn't, the courts aren't, but they are because they're the Eddie Haskell bankers.
[2:27:29.940 --> 2:27:33.940]  And more than that, as I said, they're the Wall Street mafia.
[2:27:33.940 --> 2:27:36.940]  It's Henry the Don Paulson.
[2:27:36.940 --> 2:27:41.940]  You read the New York Times, he bullied Congress, bullied Congress.
[2:27:41.940 --> 2:27:43.940]  What do you mean, bullied? Who is this guy?
[2:27:43.940 --> 2:27:45.940]  To bully Congress.
[2:27:45.940 --> 2:27:50.940]  Oh, and there's Jamie Leggs Diamond from J.P. Morgan.
[2:27:50.940 --> 2:27:58.940]  And there's, who's that guy from Citi Group that put this whole grand scheme together.
[2:27:58.940 --> 2:28:01.940]  Sandy Greedy Pigwile.
[2:28:01.940 --> 2:28:03.940]  No, let's call them who they are.
[2:28:03.940 --> 2:28:06.940]  They're robbing this nation blind.
[2:28:06.940 --> 2:28:16.940]  And the people are either drug dealers, became, we've gone, we have gone from the home of the brave
[2:28:16.940 --> 2:28:27.940]  to what's happened to this country that we have become so subservient and so federally dictated.
[2:28:27.940 --> 2:28:31.940]  We're not free and we're not brave as a nation.
[2:28:31.940 --> 2:28:36.940]  You know, people can make fun of the French all they want, but boy, the French got it down.
[2:28:36.940 --> 2:28:42.940]  Look what happened when that company was trying to chef the employees out of their severance pay.
[2:28:42.940 --> 2:28:47.940]  You know, they tried to blow the place up and all the equipment in it.
[2:28:47.940 --> 2:28:51.940]  When they do board snappings, these are the people that brought us off with their heads.
[2:28:51.940 --> 2:28:58.940]  They know what it's like to be living under the tyrannical government where they say, let them eat bread.
[2:28:58.940 --> 2:29:01.940]  Now it's give them some health care.
[2:29:01.940 --> 2:29:10.940]  Well, on top of this, when you look at the French, when they try to plant GMO crops there, the farmers just burn it down.
[2:29:10.940 --> 2:29:15.940]  And I don't know how Americans were always known as the quickest to stand up to tyranny.
[2:29:15.940 --> 2:29:20.940]  Now we're known worldwide as kind of the suckers. How did that happen?
[2:29:20.940 --> 2:29:25.940]  Well, I have to say, you know, you are what you eat.
[2:29:25.940 --> 2:29:31.940]  And look what this country eats and look what they look like and look what they've become.
[2:29:31.940 --> 2:29:36.940]  Yeah, we just became decked in it. We were the great grandchildren of really hard-working people.
[2:29:36.940 --> 2:29:41.940]  And we'd become a bunch of slobs, myself included. We got to get our dignity back and not be so cowed.
[2:29:41.940 --> 2:29:47.940]  Gerald, I want to take calls and get into where you see all this going, how you see the revolution breaking out a lot more.
[2:29:47.940 --> 2:29:50.940]  The website is trendsresearch.com.
[2:29:50.940 --> 2:30:19.940]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[2:30:20.940 --> 2:30:27.940]  We're on the march.
[2:30:50.940 --> 2:31:05.940]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[2:31:05.940 --> 2:31:09.940]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[2:31:09.940 --> 2:31:20.940]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have. It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[2:31:20.940 --> 2:31:27.940]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[2:31:27.940 --> 2:31:30.940]  Number four, the hurricane and dangerous summer storms season is here again.
[2:31:30.940 --> 2:31:34.940]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[2:31:34.940 --> 2:31:39.940]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[2:31:39.940 --> 2:31:45.940]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, a longtime sponsor of ours.
[2:31:45.940 --> 2:31:51.940]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com. That's mysolarbackup.com.

[2:32:59.940 --> 2:33:14.940]  Music
[2:33:14.940 --> 2:33:19.940]  Gerald Salente is our guest and in just three short minutes we're going right back to doing five.
[2:33:19.940 --> 2:33:31.940]  During the break, the last break, before last about ten minutes ago, I called Ted up, the owner of Genesis and minus resources and I said,
[2:33:31.940 --> 2:33:40.940]  do you have any of that gold and silver left from when gold was 900 bucks an ounce and when silver was a dollar less?
[2:33:40.940 --> 2:33:49.940]  And he said, yes, we're almost out of it, but we have the very tail end, so this is the last gold up over 40 plus dollars from that point.
[2:33:49.940 --> 2:33:59.940]  Silver way up and this is the very end of the Lakotas, the Franks, the Sovereigns and some other coins Ted Anderson has right now until midnight tonight.
[2:33:59.940 --> 2:34:02.940]  Ted, that's as long as you can hold it, correct?
[2:34:02.940 --> 2:34:10.940]  Well, I mean, I've already, the price on the internet has already gone up. If you go to our web offers, you'll find that the Lakotas are in the $19 range,
[2:34:10.940 --> 2:34:17.940]  where these are still sitting at that $18.17. So yeah, that is a really good buy.
[2:34:17.940 --> 2:34:25.940]  The reason why I was able to put them up there is I had about 900 of them left in my inventory, although some of those are spoken for already,
[2:34:25.940 --> 2:34:33.940]  and I received the checks from people, but I will hold it at that price, but then come tomorrow, it's like $19.17.
[2:34:33.940 --> 2:34:35.940]  I can't remember exactly what the number was.
[2:34:35.940 --> 2:34:42.940]  Okay, so the Lakotas are going up. What about gold at the lower price when you bought it at 900, 905?
[2:34:42.940 --> 2:34:46.940]  Well, that is obviously just a steal if I ever heard of one.
[2:34:46.940 --> 2:34:51.940]  I mean, you have still right now the Franks sitting at $216 a coin.
[2:34:51.940 --> 2:34:56.940]  The British sovereign is at $266. Both of those coins have gone up in price.
[2:34:56.940 --> 2:35:06.940]  I don't put them on our internet site, but they all are up in price because of the fact that gold was trading at $913 when I locked them in at this level.
[2:35:06.940 --> 2:35:11.940]  Currently right now, today's spot price of gold, the last time I've looked, was $951.60.
[2:35:11.940 --> 2:35:15.940]  It's been as high as $950.90 already today.
[2:35:15.940 --> 2:35:25.940]  And to simplify this, folks, for people that understand, you bought this gold and silver when the market two or three weeks ago was in gold,
[2:35:25.940 --> 2:35:30.940]  almost $50 lower than it is now, and in silver, over a dollar lower than it is now.
[2:35:30.940 --> 2:35:34.940]  So you're selling out of these stores you have. You're almost out.
[2:35:34.940 --> 2:35:38.940]  Instead of raising your prices when gold and silver goes up, that's how you should make a profit.
[2:35:38.940 --> 2:35:41.940]  We're capitalists. We're not communists.
[2:35:41.940 --> 2:35:47.940]  You're passing those savings on, but this is the end. This is the last time, Ted.
[2:35:47.940 --> 2:35:56.940]  It is the end of this. I can tell you right now, Alex, I placed an order today for 5,000 more Lakotas, and the price is much higher than what I'm offering right now.
[2:35:56.940 --> 2:35:57.940]  So I can't do that.
[2:35:57.940 --> 2:36:00.940]  And is this the end for the gold? Is this the end for the gold?
[2:36:00.940 --> 2:36:03.940]  The gold is still, they're both the same thing.
[2:36:03.940 --> 2:36:07.940]  I mean, the gold is, I mean, I'm lucky to be able to carry it through midnight.
[2:36:07.940 --> 2:36:10.940]  I will just because I'll lose some money on some of the deals.
[2:36:10.940 --> 2:36:12.940]  Okay, so you're almost completely out.
[2:36:12.940 --> 2:36:22.940]  1-800-686-2237-800-686-2237-800-686-2237.
[2:36:22.940 --> 2:36:24.940]  The brokers will be there until midnight tonight.
[2:36:24.940 --> 2:36:26.940]  Don't procrastinate. Call today.
[2:36:26.940 --> 2:36:29.940]  1-800-686-2237.
[2:36:29.940 --> 2:36:39.940]  And if you're late or if you call and leave a message, then I know Ted in the past will hold the deal into tomorrow when the brokers give you a call.
[2:36:39.940 --> 2:36:42.940]  Does that still hold today if they get their call in?
[2:36:42.940 --> 2:36:44.940]  Oh, absolutely. Just leave a message on the voice recorder.
[2:36:44.940 --> 2:36:46.940]  We're going to honor everybody.
[2:36:46.940 --> 2:36:49.940]  Alright, 800-686-2237.
[2:36:49.940 --> 2:36:51.940]  You can't get this deal at minusreverses.com.
[2:36:51.940 --> 2:36:58.940]  You've got to call and say it's the Alex Jones, Ted Anderson, Radio Special, 800-686-2237.
[2:36:58.940 --> 2:37:00.940]  Ted, thank you so much.
[2:37:00.940 --> 2:37:01.940]  Yeah, thanks for having me up, Alex.
[2:37:01.940 --> 2:37:05.940]  You bet. Going back to Gerald Salento, I appreciate holding the website again.
[2:37:05.940 --> 2:37:13.940]  We'll put up on screen for you right now for folks watching at PrismPlanet.tv, TrendsResearch.com.
[2:37:13.940 --> 2:37:16.940]  Gerald, I'm just going to throw this at you in the cold.
[2:37:16.940 --> 2:37:18.940]  I don't even know what your view is on this particularly.
[2:37:18.940 --> 2:37:23.940]  What do you think of people getting out of paper and moving partially into silver or gold?
[2:37:23.940 --> 2:37:26.940]  Is that generally a smart idea?
[2:37:26.940 --> 2:37:33.940]  Well, we don't give investment advice, but I can tell you that I'm 80% invested in gold and I keep buying it.
[2:37:33.940 --> 2:37:40.940]  And my strategy, by the way, is that I also hedge my currencies in the sense that I'll own dollars,
[2:37:40.940 --> 2:37:42.940]  but I'll also own euros.
[2:37:42.940 --> 2:37:44.940]  One goes up, the other goes down.
[2:37:44.940 --> 2:37:48.940]  I just want parity to keep what I have.
[2:37:48.940 --> 2:37:50.940]  This is about wealth preservation.
[2:37:50.940 --> 2:37:53.940]  And to us, gold is the wild card.
[2:37:53.940 --> 2:38:00.940]  But having said that, as you may or may not know, in our 2000, December 2001,
[2:38:00.940 --> 2:38:06.940]  we had said that gold prices had bottomed and we've been bullish on gold since,
[2:38:06.940 --> 2:38:11.940]  and we're predicting in our forecast of gold 2000.
[2:38:11.940 --> 2:38:14.940]  Really? Do you have an idea when?
[2:38:14.940 --> 2:38:19.940]  No, it's hard to tell because, as you well know, these markets are being highly manipulated.
[2:38:19.940 --> 2:38:20.940]  Sure.
[2:38:20.940 --> 2:38:25.940]  And around the world, people are bailing out of bucks, as we spoke about earlier,
[2:38:25.940 --> 2:38:28.940]  and they're looking for a new reserve currency.
[2:38:28.940 --> 2:38:34.940]  I mentioned earlier that the Obama administration is holding out, coming out with their budget projections,
[2:38:34.940 --> 2:38:41.940]  waiting until the dead heat of summer when everyone's in a vacation state of mind and Congress isn't there.
[2:38:41.940 --> 2:38:47.940]  So there can be some very earth-shaking developments that are going to rattle the dollar.
[2:38:47.940 --> 2:38:53.940]  So it could happen at any time, but always remember that the game is going to be manipulated
[2:38:53.940 --> 2:38:59.940]  because once the world wakes up to the idea that their fiat currencies
[2:38:59.940 --> 2:39:05.940]  aren't going to be worth the paper they're printed on, there's going to be a huge run to gold.
[2:39:05.940 --> 2:39:11.940]  Another very important aspect is only one member of the G20 out there
[2:39:11.940 --> 2:39:17.940]  that's really criticizing America for its stimulus recovery, bailout and buyout.
[2:39:17.940 --> 2:39:18.940]  Terminates.
[2:39:18.940 --> 2:39:20.940]  And why?
[2:39:20.940 --> 2:39:23.940]  Because of gold issues.
[2:39:23.940 --> 2:39:25.940]  And they know what it's like.
[2:39:25.940 --> 2:39:28.940]  These are the people, the Weimar Republic.
[2:39:28.940 --> 2:39:36.940]  They still have the people alive that told the stories of going to a supermarket with a wheelbarrow of money.
[2:39:36.940 --> 2:39:43.940]  And they know how it happened because they printed phantom money, had a thin air based on nothing,
[2:39:43.940 --> 2:39:45.940]  and producing practically nothing.
[2:39:45.940 --> 2:39:49.940]  So that's why we're bullish on gold.
[2:39:49.940 --> 2:39:53.940]  But the bankers to kill hyperinflation aren't just loaning the money,
[2:39:53.940 --> 2:40:00.940]  so instead you have everything imploding while they print fiat to buy up real infrastructure.
[2:40:00.940 --> 2:40:05.940]  And then from the experts we've talked to, I want to see if you agree with the general economists we've had on,
[2:40:05.940 --> 2:40:12.940]  that then later the hyperinflation comes as an added nightmare over a depression economy,
[2:40:12.940 --> 2:40:19.940]  the untold superstorm or perfect storm of hyper-stag inflation.
[2:40:19.940 --> 2:40:20.940]  Yes, that's very true.
[2:40:20.940 --> 2:40:23.940]  And depression, actually, is hyperinflation and depression.
[2:40:23.940 --> 2:40:24.940]  Look at the numbers.
[2:40:24.940 --> 2:40:30.940]  You well know, depending on who you talk to, the effective unemployment rate is 18.7%.
[2:40:30.940 --> 2:40:34.940]  Others say the unofficial rate is 20%.
[2:40:34.940 --> 2:40:36.940]  So that's what we're really looking at.
[2:40:36.940 --> 2:40:41.940]  People going, these kids going to college, are they going to get jobs doing what?
[2:40:41.940 --> 2:40:42.940]  That's what I was about to say.
[2:40:42.940 --> 2:40:45.940]  You were saying the next big bubble is the college bubble.
[2:40:45.940 --> 2:40:48.940]  They're going into debt now for jobs that aren't even going to exist,
[2:40:48.940 --> 2:40:52.940]  and the commercial real estate, as you said on the show a year and a half ago,
[2:40:52.940 --> 2:40:53.940]  is starting to implode.
[2:40:53.940 --> 2:40:55.940]  They're saying that's the next big one.
[2:40:55.940 --> 2:40:57.940]  Give us some of those trends.
[2:40:57.940 --> 2:41:01.940]  But going back to gold, because we've interviewed so many experts who are bullish or bearish on gold,
[2:41:01.940 --> 2:41:09.940]  but all of them acknowledge that everybody should be partially in gold and silvered as a hedge against inflation,
[2:41:09.940 --> 2:41:13.940]  as an emergency parachute to just protect wealth,
[2:41:13.940 --> 2:41:17.940]  to make sure you've got something that can't be dissipated overnight like paper,
[2:41:17.940 --> 2:41:21.940]  but that's speculatively, it's also the biggest boon in speculative,
[2:41:21.940 --> 2:41:24.940]  because if the dollar does implode or other major currencies,
[2:41:24.940 --> 2:41:26.940]  they're all over printing right now, as you know,
[2:41:26.940 --> 2:41:30.940]  that's kind of their answer is global inflation, kind of at parity,
[2:41:30.940 --> 2:41:33.940]  that gold could go to $3,000, $4,000.
[2:41:33.940 --> 2:41:34.940]  Well, it can.
[2:41:34.940 --> 2:41:35.940]  It really can.
[2:41:35.940 --> 2:41:40.940]  You know, they keep, and then if there's war on top of this,
[2:41:40.940 --> 2:41:44.940]  because who knows, they keep talking about bombing Iran,
[2:41:44.940 --> 2:41:48.940]  Israel does, or invading them at some level,
[2:41:48.940 --> 2:41:55.940]  and we've said from the onset that if the United States or Israel attack Iran,
[2:41:55.940 --> 2:41:57.940]  it's the beginning of World War III,
[2:41:57.940 --> 2:42:04.940]  because then you're going to start seeing oil prices go to the stratosphere along with gold prices.
[2:42:04.940 --> 2:42:12.940]  So there are so many wild cards out there that make for us gold a better forecast
[2:42:12.940 --> 2:42:14.940]  to go up than to go down.
[2:42:14.940 --> 2:42:16.940]  I mean, what could be the downside of gold?
[2:42:16.940 --> 2:42:22.940]  Gold, as we see, could only go down if the unemployment rate in the United States
[2:42:22.940 --> 2:42:25.940]  goes back to 4.5%.
[2:42:25.940 --> 2:42:29.940]  We wipe out our trade deficits, our budget deficits,
[2:42:29.940 --> 2:42:31.940]  and that's highly unlikely.
[2:42:31.940 --> 2:42:35.940]  And you're physically holding it, you can jump out of it if it starts going down,
[2:42:35.940 --> 2:42:37.940]  or you can wait till it goes back up the next time.
[2:42:37.940 --> 2:42:39.940]  I have to tell you something.
[2:42:39.940 --> 2:42:40.940]  This is very important.
[2:42:40.940 --> 2:42:43.940]  I've been buying gold for a long time.
[2:42:43.940 --> 2:42:45.940]  In life, you have ups and downs.
[2:42:45.940 --> 2:42:48.940]  Let's not be fake about this.
[2:42:48.940 --> 2:42:51.940]  I've had lean years in my life.
[2:42:51.940 --> 2:42:56.940]  What saved me was having gold, because as you well know,
[2:42:56.940 --> 2:43:02.940]  it's getting rid of gold, but cashing in gold isn't as easy as writing a check.
[2:43:02.940 --> 2:43:06.940]  So you really have to think twice and three times and four times
[2:43:06.940 --> 2:43:08.940]  before you want to load that gold.
[2:43:08.940 --> 2:43:15.940]  And so you hold on to that store wealth, that base of wealth
[2:43:15.940 --> 2:43:19.940]  without writing a check off to go spend it or to pay it debt.
[2:43:19.940 --> 2:43:26.940]  And what I also did with my gold is I used it as collateral to borrow,
[2:43:26.940 --> 2:43:29.940]  knowing that I wanted that gold back,
[2:43:29.940 --> 2:43:33.940]  and I never had any problem loading money, borrowing money privately,
[2:43:33.940 --> 2:43:36.940]  having that as a backdrop.
[2:43:36.940 --> 2:43:38.940]  So I'm a firm believer in gold.
[2:43:38.940 --> 2:43:40.940]  It's good as gold as the saying.
[2:43:40.940 --> 2:43:45.940]  I just wanted to bring that up because everything else is performing like hell right now.
[2:43:45.940 --> 2:43:47.940]  Treasuries almost have no yield.
[2:43:47.940 --> 2:43:49.940]  Everybody's running to them.
[2:43:49.940 --> 2:43:52.940]  And it's just an amazing scam we're witnessing.
[2:43:52.940 --> 2:43:56.940]  I want to go to calls for Gerald Salante here in just a moment in the time we have left.
[2:43:56.940 --> 2:44:00.940]  But Gerald, how do you see, well, two questions before I forget.
[2:44:00.940 --> 2:44:05.940]  First, the flu hype killed maybe 200 people worldwide.
[2:44:05.940 --> 2:44:07.940]  They're talking about global force inoculations.
[2:44:07.940 --> 2:44:10.940]  Is this the global world trade organization,
[2:44:10.940 --> 2:44:14.940]  World Health Organization cover to bring in control?
[2:44:14.940 --> 2:44:17.940]  Why are they saying, oh, it's all over in the fall.
[2:44:17.940 --> 2:44:20.940]  They're the ones fair mongering in government.
[2:44:20.940 --> 2:44:23.940]  A, and then B, is that kind of a backdrop?
[2:44:23.940 --> 2:44:28.940]  If they need to suppress revolution, they'll just hype up fear about flu,
[2:44:28.940 --> 2:44:32.940]  and then people will stand down because that was said of Mexico.
[2:44:32.940 --> 2:44:36.940]  What they're doing and why we don't know, and we're not on the inside,
[2:44:36.940 --> 2:44:38.940]  but I will tell you what we're forecasting.
[2:44:38.940 --> 2:44:42.940]  And we're forecasting that there's going to be something.
[2:44:42.940 --> 2:44:46.940]  And it's going to be, we're calling it the new black plague, and it's going to be real.
[2:44:46.940 --> 2:44:52.940]  You can't put poison in your food, in the air, in the water.
[2:44:52.940 --> 2:44:58.940]  You can't dump, you just can't keep poisoning the host without causing a host of problems.
[2:44:58.940 --> 2:45:02.940]  So there's going to be something that breaks down the immune system.
[2:45:02.940 --> 2:45:03.940]  Is this really it?
[2:45:03.940 --> 2:45:04.940]  Probably not.
[2:45:04.940 --> 2:45:08.940]  Are the drug companies going to benefit from anything that happens?
[2:45:08.940 --> 2:45:09.940]  Absolutely.
[2:45:09.940 --> 2:45:16.940]  Will they use something like this as the false flag to declare martial law
[2:45:16.940 --> 2:45:23.940]  and to take the people that were once the home of the free and the brave
[2:45:23.940 --> 2:45:27.940]  into federal dictate and to subservience?
[2:45:27.940 --> 2:45:33.940]  Yes, they could very well use something like that as a scare tactic.
[2:45:33.940 --> 2:45:42.940]  I mean, Bush used the most effective one that I've seen in my lifetime with the war on terror.
[2:45:42.940 --> 2:45:43.940]  Absolutely.
[2:45:43.940 --> 2:45:46.940]  And then they've got the continuing and floating economy.
[2:45:46.940 --> 2:45:49.940]  I mean, people have to go to the government from help through that.
[2:45:49.940 --> 2:45:52.940]  And then now they're announcing he's breaking all his promises.
[2:45:52.940 --> 2:46:00.940]  He's going to raise healthcare taxes on everybody and surtaxes and green taxes on everybody's electricity.
[2:46:00.940 --> 2:46:07.940]  I mean, would you say Obama wins or is a contender for the crown of the biggest liar?
[2:46:07.940 --> 2:46:09.940]  Because I thought Clinton was a liar.
[2:46:09.940 --> 2:46:10.940]  I thought Bush was a liar.
[2:46:10.940 --> 2:46:18.940]  Well, the thing that we put Obama in is the mass destruction of what was once the entrepreneurial empire
[2:46:18.940 --> 2:46:24.940]  into what Mussolini said the merger of state and corporate powers into fascism
[2:46:24.940 --> 2:46:28.940]  where government and major corporations are running the whole show.
[2:46:28.940 --> 2:46:33.940]  Again, look at the people, look at the banks, look at the control.
[2:46:33.940 --> 2:46:35.940]  And so that's what we see.
[2:46:35.940 --> 2:46:39.940]  And by the way, people ask us, what are some of the solutions?
[2:46:39.940 --> 2:46:41.940]  Well, here's one solution.
[2:46:41.940 --> 2:46:43.940]  We don't need Wall Street.
[2:46:43.940 --> 2:46:45.940]  We need Main Street.
[2:46:45.940 --> 2:46:48.940]  We don't need Walmarts.
[2:46:48.940 --> 2:46:50.940]  We need mom and pops.
[2:46:50.940 --> 2:46:53.940]  We don't need agribusiness.
[2:46:53.940 --> 2:46:55.940]  We need family farms.
[2:46:55.940 --> 2:46:58.940]  We don't need Monsanto.
[2:46:58.940 --> 2:47:00.940]  We need organic.
[2:47:00.940 --> 2:47:02.940]  And this is not hyperbole.
[2:47:02.940 --> 2:47:09.940]  It's a fact, a fact based on the knowledge that we were the United States of America,
[2:47:09.940 --> 2:47:18.940]  the most egalitarian nation on earth, respected and envied by everyone else on earth.
[2:47:18.940 --> 2:47:27.940]  From the most egalitarian, when that model existed, Main Street, mom and pop, family farm and organic,
[2:47:27.940 --> 2:47:32.940]  we have now become the nation where the gap between the rich and the poor
[2:47:32.940 --> 2:47:36.940]  is the widest of any of the industrialized nations
[2:47:36.940 --> 2:47:42.940]  and where we used to be number one in healthcare and education and longevity,
[2:47:42.940 --> 2:47:50.940]  in quality of life, when we lived by Main Street, mom and pop, family farms and organic,
[2:47:50.940 --> 2:47:56.940]  we no longer win place or show by any of those indices.
[2:47:56.940 --> 2:48:02.940]  Because we're mentally and spiritually poisoned and the establishment knew that,
[2:48:02.940 --> 2:48:09.940]  and all of those big vertically integrated corporate structures are waging war against mom and pop and Main Street.
[2:48:09.940 --> 2:48:14.940]  And now they've got the animal ID, the premises ID, openly to shut down family farms and ranches,
[2:48:14.940 --> 2:48:17.940]  the Clean Water Restoration Act to federalize all the water.
[2:48:17.940 --> 2:48:21.940]  I mean, they're coming in as the economy implodes, trying to pass the carbon tax,
[2:48:21.940 --> 2:48:24.940]  knowing it'll shut things down further.
[2:48:24.940 --> 2:48:28.940]  This is like the global mafia burning us out.
[2:48:28.940 --> 2:48:31.940]  So you're saying the revolution isn't just physical.
[2:48:31.940 --> 2:48:35.940]  It's going to be people not going to Walmart anymore, people planting their own gardens,
[2:48:35.940 --> 2:48:39.940]  people not doing what the local thugs and feds say,
[2:48:39.940 --> 2:48:42.940]  and people just getting back to basics?
[2:48:42.940 --> 2:48:44.940]  Or what else is in the revolution?
[2:48:44.940 --> 2:48:45.940]  Well, that's part of it.
[2:48:45.940 --> 2:48:48.940]  My thing is I boycott corporate food.
[2:48:48.940 --> 2:48:49.940]  I won't eat it.
[2:48:49.940 --> 2:48:51.940]  I go to the local guy.
[2:48:51.940 --> 2:48:53.940]  I won't go to the Dunkin' Donuts guy.
[2:48:53.940 --> 2:48:55.940]  I support.
[2:48:55.940 --> 2:48:57.940]  I go to the farmers markets.
[2:48:57.940 --> 2:49:00.940]  I don't buy factory food.
[2:49:00.940 --> 2:49:06.940]  You know, Alex, we just saw Obama, they made a whole big deal about the planting their organic garden
[2:49:06.940 --> 2:49:11.940]  and buying local food and how healthy they eat.
[2:49:11.940 --> 2:49:15.940]  Let the rest of them eat franken foods is their motto.
[2:49:15.940 --> 2:49:21.940]  It's okay for them and the Clintons and the Bushes to everybody to only eat the best.
[2:49:21.940 --> 2:49:26.940]  But the rest of you people out there, fatten yourself up on the junk food.
[2:49:26.940 --> 2:49:29.940]  What goes in goes out.
[2:49:29.940 --> 2:49:32.940]  Junk food, junk minds, junk thinking.
[2:49:32.940 --> 2:49:37.940]  And for this country to get back to where it used to be, we need a renaissance.
[2:49:37.940 --> 2:49:42.940]  And the renaissance is a rebirth, a rebirth to when America was great,
[2:49:42.940 --> 2:49:49.940]  when Main Street ruled, not Wall Street, not these greedy multi-millionaires.
[2:49:49.940 --> 2:49:50.940]  Where do they come off?
[2:49:50.940 --> 2:49:56.940]  Goldman Sachs saying that, well, we earn this profits and we're distributing this money,
[2:49:56.940 --> 2:50:01.940]  these bonuses to our people because we're such brilliant traders.
[2:50:01.940 --> 2:50:02.940]  Oh, yeah.
[2:50:02.940 --> 2:50:08.940]  How about the $13 billion we gave you to cover your bed beds with AIG?
[2:50:08.940 --> 2:50:10.940]  And then they took the money and then loaned it to us in interest.
[2:50:10.940 --> 2:50:12.940]  And it's just total bastards.
[2:50:12.940 --> 2:50:16.940]  We're going to come back in the final segment, Dr. Maria, Linda and Randall.
[2:50:16.940 --> 2:50:21.940]  Quick comments, quick questions from those three callers, quick answers from Gerald Salente.
[2:50:21.940 --> 2:50:24.940]  And I can't wait to have him back up again soon.
[2:50:24.940 --> 2:50:26.940]  But Wendy, we got 30 seconds for a break.
[2:50:26.940 --> 2:50:30.940]  Gerald, when do you see physical confrontation, rioting beginning?
[2:50:30.940 --> 2:50:37.940]  You know, we may see riots this summer as the heat of the city streets becomes uncontrollable,
[2:50:37.940 --> 2:50:41.940]  as people can't find jobs and have no future.
[2:50:41.940 --> 2:50:46.940]  And then they're talking about, by next year, 25% unemployment?
[2:50:46.940 --> 2:50:51.940]  And when you look upon the minority groups, the people that have no education,
[2:50:51.940 --> 2:50:56.940]  and then they're drugged out, you have a recipe for violence and disaster.
[2:50:56.940 --> 2:51:00.940]  Stay there, Gerald Salente. I'm Alex Jones.
[2:51:06.940 --> 2:51:13.940]  Aerial spraying, chemtrails, the modified atmosphere, heavy metals and pesticides,
[2:51:13.940 --> 2:51:18.940]  carcinogens and chemical fibers all falling from the sky.
[2:51:18.940 --> 2:51:21.940]  You have a choice to keep your body clean.
[2:51:21.940 --> 2:51:26.940]  Detoxify with micro plant powder from hempusa.org
[2:51:26.940 --> 2:51:31.940]  or call 908-691-2608.
[2:51:31.940 --> 2:51:35.940]  It's odorless and tasteless and used in any liquid or food.
[2:51:35.940 --> 2:51:39.940]  Protect your family now with micro plant powder.
[2:51:39.940 --> 2:51:43.940]  Cleaning out heavy metals, parasites and toxins.
[2:51:43.940 --> 2:51:48.940]  Water it now for daily intake and stock it now for long term storage.
[2:51:48.940 --> 2:52:17.940]  Visit hempusa.org or call 908-691-2608 today.
[2:52:18.940 --> 2:52:22.940]  Aerial spraying to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[2:52:48.940 --> 2:53:07.940]  Millions of Americans are beginning to realize the enormity of the economic and political problems facing the U.S. and the world.
[2:53:07.940 --> 2:53:11.940]  And for the first time in their lives, they are feeling the need for preparedness.
[2:53:11.940 --> 2:53:14.940]  Ready Reserve Foods has been in continuous operation,
[2:53:14.940 --> 2:53:18.940]  manufacturing the finest and dehydrated foods for almost 40 years.
[2:53:18.940 --> 2:53:22.940]  Ready Reserve is the manufacturer, unlike other companies that just broker canned foods.
[2:53:22.940 --> 2:53:28.940]  Ready Reserve controls the quality from start to finish with doubly-nameled cans and nitrogen packaging.
[2:53:28.940 --> 2:53:33.940]  When purchasing from Ready Reserve Foods, you are buying factory direct at wholesale prices.
[2:53:33.940 --> 2:53:38.940]  Other companies are quoting delivery times of one to two months while Ready Reserve ships within five business days.
[2:53:38.940 --> 2:53:41.940]  Many companies do not even offer a catalog.
[2:53:41.940 --> 2:53:44.940]  We would be more than happy to send a catalog to you free of charge.
[2:53:44.940 --> 2:53:53.940]  Dial 1-800-453-2202, 1-800-453-2202 or visit our website at readyreservefoods.com.
[2:53:53.940 --> 2:53:56.940]  Factory direct, wholesale pricing from Ready Reserve Foods.
[2:53:56.940 --> 2:54:02.940]  Call us at 1-800-453-2202.
[2:54:02.940 --> 2:54:12.940]  General Salenta, I want to jam in a few final calls here for you, but quickly I have this question. Can all the king's horses, all the king's men, all the police state grid, they've set up,
[2:54:12.940 --> 2:54:17.940]  planning this bankruptcy all along to bring in their new world order, is it going to be successful?
[2:54:17.940 --> 2:54:21.940]  Because even with all the Obama hype, it's not working.
[2:54:21.940 --> 2:54:25.940]  I mean, this looks like it's going to turn into a really bloody confrontation.
[2:54:25.940 --> 2:54:27.940]  Well, it's not going to be ugly.
[2:54:27.940 --> 2:54:31.940]  I mean, now they're changing their tune from green shoots.
[2:54:31.940 --> 2:54:33.940]  I'm saying a double-dip recession.
[2:54:33.940 --> 2:54:35.940]  It's not a double-dip recession.
[2:54:35.940 --> 2:54:36.940]  It never ended.
[2:54:36.940 --> 2:54:38.940]  It's going to be a great recession.
[2:54:38.940 --> 2:54:41.940]  It's almost pregnant, isn't it?
[2:54:41.940 --> 2:54:45.940]  No, so no, it's not going to be able to stop it.
[2:54:45.940 --> 2:54:56.940]  The only way they will be able to stop it is to continue to do what they're doing, and that is to keep the people on the federal dictate and to make them more subservient.
[2:54:56.940 --> 2:55:01.940]  And the pressure that is going to be bearing upon the people at every level,
[2:55:01.940 --> 2:55:10.940]  from parking meters to property taxes, from federal taxes to syntaxes, is going to be taxes.
[2:55:10.940 --> 2:55:15.940]  They're going to squeeze the little people until there are riots and rebellions.
[2:55:15.940 --> 2:55:22.940]  And by the way, the tea parties and tax protests, that's just the beginning.
[2:55:22.940 --> 2:55:26.940]  It was history that has been made, and they're trying to play it down.
[2:55:26.940 --> 2:55:30.940]  Maria in California, you're on the air with Gerald Salente.
[2:55:30.940 --> 2:55:31.940]  Hi, Joan.
[2:55:31.940 --> 2:55:32.940]  I'm Salente.
[2:55:32.940 --> 2:55:34.940]  It's an honor to speak with both of you.
[2:55:34.940 --> 2:55:38.940]  I actually wanted to call in because I'm calling from Pomona, California.
[2:55:38.940 --> 2:55:48.940]  And in the past two months, the police activity here has gone from hearing them once, maybe every other month, to hearing them three times a day.
[2:55:48.940 --> 2:55:51.940]  I'm hearing the ambulance go off and the police everywhere.
[2:55:51.940 --> 2:55:55.940]  And I just want to know, if I'm living in a suburban area like this,
[2:55:55.940 --> 2:55:59.940]  I mean, how bad is it going to get while our city council would be in there?
[2:55:59.940 --> 2:56:00.940]  Yeah, that's something they're covering up, Gerald.
[2:56:00.940 --> 2:56:03.940]  Obviously, crimes exploding.
[2:56:03.940 --> 2:56:05.940]  They're trying to squeeze the public.
[2:56:05.940 --> 2:56:06.940]  It's not working.
[2:56:06.940 --> 2:56:09.940]  You said a year ago on the show, California was going to collapse.
[2:56:09.940 --> 2:56:11.940]  That's now a beginning, Gerald.
[2:56:11.940 --> 2:56:12.940]  Yes, it is beginning.
[2:56:12.940 --> 2:56:14.940]  There's going to be other states to follow.
[2:56:14.940 --> 2:56:17.940]  I mean, Michigan around Detroit, it's a war zone.
[2:56:17.940 --> 2:56:24.940]  You know, my saying as a Bronx boy is when people lose everything and they have nothing left to lose, they lose it.
[2:56:24.940 --> 2:56:27.940]  We're going to see more of these home invasions, kidnappings.
[2:56:27.940 --> 2:56:30.940]  It's going to turn ugly over the years.
[2:56:30.940 --> 2:56:35.940]  So I'm a believer in Second Amendment rights, as are you, Alex,
[2:56:35.940 --> 2:56:40.940]  and that people need to learn self-protection because nobody's going to protect you.
[2:56:40.940 --> 2:56:51.940]  And as you also know, I'm a close combat practitioner and John Perkins from attackproof.com has been my teacher for many, many years.
[2:56:51.940 --> 2:56:57.940]  So people have to understand there will be no savior other than yourself.
[2:56:57.940 --> 2:56:58.940]  Absolutely.
[2:56:58.940 --> 2:57:00.940]  Maria, does that answer your question?
[2:57:00.940 --> 2:57:01.940]  Yes, it does.
[2:57:01.940 --> 2:57:02.940]  One more question.
[2:57:02.940 --> 2:57:03.940]  I've prepared.
[2:57:03.940 --> 2:57:04.940]  I've stockpiled.
[2:57:04.940 --> 2:57:06.940]  I have my gun and everything.
[2:57:06.940 --> 2:57:09.940]  What can I do with the rest of my fee-out money?
[2:57:09.940 --> 2:57:12.940]  Well, again, we don't give financial advice.
[2:57:12.940 --> 2:57:14.940]  I could only tell you what I do with mine.
[2:57:14.940 --> 2:57:17.940]  And I'm very heavily invested in gold.
[2:57:17.940 --> 2:57:21.940]  And I also, what I do is because I run a business, I need cash.
[2:57:21.940 --> 2:57:27.940]  I put my money between different currencies so that if the dollar goes down, the other one goes up.
[2:57:27.940 --> 2:57:29.940]  Maria answered that earlier.
[2:57:29.940 --> 2:57:30.940]  We got a jump.
[2:57:30.940 --> 2:57:31.940]  Final call.
[2:57:31.940 --> 2:57:32.940]  Linda in Rhode Island.
[2:57:32.940 --> 2:57:34.940]  Quickly, you're on the air with Gerald Salente.
[2:57:34.940 --> 2:57:35.940]  Hi, Alex and Gerald.
[2:57:35.940 --> 2:57:43.940]  I have a question for Gerald. Last week, a Bob Chapman was on, and he stated that they would close the banks for a week,
[2:57:43.940 --> 2:57:45.940]  and that they were going to open them up again.
[2:57:45.940 --> 2:57:46.940]  Everything was going to be all right.
[2:57:46.940 --> 2:57:48.940]  I think he was too light-hearted on that.
[2:57:48.940 --> 2:57:50.940]  Can you say something about that?
[2:57:50.940 --> 2:57:56.940]  Well, if they close the banks, we believe that they'll devalue the dollar when they reopen them.
[2:57:56.940 --> 2:57:58.940]  You won't be able to get all your money back out.
[2:57:58.940 --> 2:58:00.940]  They'll use the Argentinian method.
[2:58:00.940 --> 2:58:09.940]  That's what they did over there when their dollar collapsed, and that's what we believe they'll do over here.
[2:58:09.940 --> 2:58:11.940]  Does that answer your question, Linda?
[2:58:11.940 --> 2:58:14.940]  You'll be able to get your money, but you won't be able to get it out all at once.
[2:58:14.940 --> 2:58:15.940]  Right.
[2:58:15.940 --> 2:58:19.940]  And it won't be worth what it was if they close the banks.
[2:58:19.940 --> 2:58:24.940]  Yeah, because we're going to want to go to work thinking, oh, maybe they'll get paid in a month.
[2:58:24.940 --> 2:58:26.940]  Yeah, Linda, thank you.
[2:58:26.940 --> 2:58:31.940]  Gerald Salente, thank you so much for spending time with us. We'll talk to you again very, very soon.
[2:58:31.940 --> 2:58:32.940]  Thank you.
[2:58:32.940 --> 2:58:33.940]  Thank you, Alex.
[2:58:33.940 --> 2:58:34.940]  Oh, he's great being on your show.
[2:58:34.940 --> 2:58:35.940]  God bless you.
[2:58:35.940 --> 2:58:36.940]  It's always great having you.
[2:58:36.940 --> 2:58:37.940]  Retransmission starts now.
[2:58:37.940 --> 2:58:39.940]  Infowars.com.
[2:58:39.940 --> 2:58:40.940]  Great job, Cruz.
[2:58:42.940 --> 2:58:44.940]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[2:58:44.940 --> 2:58:48.940]  Be sure to visit GCNLive.com today.
[2:58:50.940 --> 2:58:53.940]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[2:58:53.940 --> 2:58:58.940]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[2:58:58.940 --> 2:59:04.940]  My answer would be all I can get in the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones.
[2:59:04.940 --> 2:59:06.940]  Food is your only ammunition.
[2:59:06.940 --> 2:59:07.940]  How much do you want?
[2:59:07.940 --> 2:59:08.940]  When do you want it?
[2:59:08.940 --> 2:59:10.940]  Now or after the battle starts?
[2:59:10.940 --> 2:59:11.940]  When will you need it?
[2:59:11.940 --> 2:59:13.940]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[2:59:13.940 --> 2:59:14.940]  Will there be any food?
[2:59:14.940 --> 2:59:16.940]  Will it make your children sick?
[2:59:16.940 --> 2:59:21.940]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[2:59:21.940 --> 2:59:25.940]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[2:59:25.940 --> 2:59:29.940]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[2:59:29.940 --> 2:59:30.940]  How much will you need?
[2:59:30.940 --> 2:59:31.940]  We don't know.
[2:59:31.940 --> 2:59:32.940]  How much do you want?
[2:59:32.940 --> 2:59:33.940]  All you can get.
[2:59:33.940 --> 2:59:34.940]  I'm Alex Jones.
[2:59:34.940 --> 2:59:37.940]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[2:59:37.940 --> 2:59:44.940]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[2:59:44.940 --> 2:59:53.940]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[2:59:53.940 --> 2:59:55.940]  Waging war on corruption.
[2:59:55.940 --> 3:00:00.940]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[3:00:00.940 --> 3:00:15.940]  We've got a few minutes left with Manny Badia and we've got the legend fighting the war.
[3:00:15.940 --> 3:00:19.940]  Do you ever griffin joining us in the Mounds of the Hour and the folks that have been holding that you're going to talk to Griffin?
[3:00:19.940 --> 3:00:20.940]  We saved the best the last.
[3:00:20.940 --> 3:00:22.940]  You get to hold, you get to talk to him.
[3:00:22.940 --> 3:00:23.940]  We all want to hear from everybody.
[3:00:23.940 --> 3:00:24.940]  I appreciate folks that...
[3:00:24.940 --> 3:00:26.940]  I meant to get to calls earlier in the hour.
[3:00:26.940 --> 3:00:29.940]  I was just covering all the eugenics news and never got around to some of those calls.
[3:00:29.940 --> 3:00:32.940]  Going back to Manny Badia.
[3:00:32.940 --> 3:00:33.940]  Okay, so you're in this meeting.
[3:00:33.940 --> 3:00:35.940]  Tell us where it was, what was happening.
[3:00:35.940 --> 3:00:37.940]  You're writing an article for infowars.com.
[3:00:37.940 --> 3:00:39.940]  We're going to get very, very soon.
[3:00:39.940 --> 3:00:41.940]  Just make sure I don't miss that when it comes.
[3:00:41.940 --> 3:00:44.940]  In fact, Ballpark, when are we getting that article so we can post it, Manny?
[3:00:44.940 --> 3:00:46.940]  You're going to be getting that within the next couple of days.
[3:00:46.940 --> 3:00:51.940]  I'm still waiting to hear back from the prosecution team that asked me to e-mail them about this evidence,
[3:00:51.940 --> 3:00:54.940]  which should very easily be found by simple internet searches.
[3:00:54.940 --> 3:00:55.940]  Well, they always say that.
[3:00:55.940 --> 3:01:00.940]  And we didn't know that Ben Laden had been CIA, it's just BBC, AP Reuters.
[3:01:00.940 --> 3:01:02.940]  But we didn't know Nor Ed stood down that day.
[3:01:02.940 --> 3:01:05.940]  There were drills of hijacked jets flying into the buildings.
[3:01:05.940 --> 3:01:07.940]  But all that aside, where were you?
[3:01:07.940 --> 3:01:08.940]  You got invited.
[3:01:08.940 --> 3:01:10.940]  What else did you ask them?
[3:01:10.940 --> 3:01:12.940]  Because you told us in the end they were telling you, shut up.
[3:01:12.940 --> 3:01:15.940]  Yeah, essentially they were saying, listen, where did you get that from?
[3:01:15.940 --> 3:01:16.940]  You e-mail us.
[3:01:16.940 --> 3:01:17.940]  That's it.
[3:01:17.940 --> 3:01:18.940]  That's it.
[3:01:18.940 --> 3:01:19.940]  You know, it comes down to this.
[3:01:19.940 --> 3:01:26.940]  I brought up the fact that the case that the family members brought,
[3:01:26.940 --> 3:01:31.940]  all the way to the Supreme Court, that the Supreme Court refused to listen to us.
[3:01:31.940 --> 3:01:35.940]  As of last week, 7,000 family members with the evidence against Saudi Arabia
[3:01:35.940 --> 3:01:40.940]  asked them if they were going to how strong of a case they would have had if they had that evidence.
[3:01:40.940 --> 3:01:44.940]  I also said to them 70% of our questions were never answered during the commission.
[3:01:44.940 --> 3:01:49.940]  There would be another sham trial that the family members then have to go through
[3:01:49.940 --> 3:01:52.940]  and then expect to have some sort of justice.
[3:01:52.940 --> 3:01:56.940]  And I said to them this, I said, does anybody here really feel that it was only five people
[3:01:56.940 --> 3:01:58.940]  that did this silence?
[3:01:58.940 --> 3:02:01.940]  Alex, there had to be at least four or five times of silence.
[3:02:01.940 --> 3:02:07.940]  And that's why it's so important that the mission of NYCCAN.org is accomplished.
[3:02:07.940 --> 3:02:08.940]  Exactly.
[3:02:08.940 --> 3:02:10.940]  And we'll have you back on about that.
[3:02:10.940 --> 3:02:15.940]  I want to continue in the limited time with this because talking to you over the phone,
[3:02:15.940 --> 3:02:18.940]  my producer said that you also said that at one point they just said, look, be quiet.
[3:02:18.940 --> 3:02:19.940]  Shut up.
[3:02:19.940 --> 3:02:20.940]  We've heard enough from you.
[3:02:20.940 --> 3:02:22.940]  Where did you hear this information?
[3:02:22.940 --> 3:02:23.940]  Exactly.
[3:02:23.940 --> 3:02:24.940]  They were asking me where it came from.
[3:02:24.940 --> 3:02:26.940]  I was telling this is AP Reuters source.
[3:02:26.940 --> 3:02:29.940]  I was telling them this comes from intelligence agencies.
[3:02:29.940 --> 3:02:32.940]  The Indian intelligence agency actually spoke about...
[3:02:32.940 --> 3:02:37.940]  Did you tell them about Strangman, the head of the visa in Saudi Arabia?
[3:02:37.940 --> 3:02:41.940]  And he's being told let out of them in their CIA?
[3:02:41.940 --> 3:02:46.940]  That I didn't have an opportunity to, but this is something else that I can continue
[3:02:46.940 --> 3:02:47.940]  to correspond with them.
[3:02:47.940 --> 3:02:48.940]  I want to tell you something.
[3:02:48.940 --> 3:02:53.940]  I mean, this is on record that the hijackers were all trained at US military bases in super
[3:02:53.940 --> 3:02:54.940]  high clearance.
[3:02:54.940 --> 3:02:55.940]  That's AP.
[3:02:55.940 --> 3:02:57.940]  I mean, this is a fact.
[3:02:57.940 --> 3:02:59.940]  I mean, that the embassies wouldn't let them in.
[3:02:59.940 --> 3:03:00.940]  And they'd say, let them in.
[3:03:00.940 --> 3:03:01.940]  These are high-level operatives.
[3:03:01.940 --> 3:03:02.940]  Yes, sir.
[3:03:02.940 --> 3:03:03.940]  Who?
[3:03:03.940 --> 3:03:04.940]  Case closed.
[3:03:04.940 --> 3:03:05.940]  They did it.
[3:03:05.940 --> 3:03:06.940]  It's over.
[3:03:06.940 --> 3:03:07.940]  And case closed, this.
[3:03:07.940 --> 3:03:14.940]  I actually, and I commented a few times to a few of my close friends about how the next
[3:03:14.940 --> 3:03:17.940]  night I was on a conference call with Candace Gorman.
[3:03:17.940 --> 3:03:22.940]  She is one of the defendants of three of the people that are being accused during the sham
[3:03:22.940 --> 3:03:25.940]  9-11 trial that's taking place starting this week down in Guantanamo.
[3:03:25.940 --> 3:03:28.940]  So I listened to her conference call.
[3:03:28.940 --> 3:03:30.940]  I had an opportunity to ask questions there.
[3:03:30.940 --> 3:03:35.940]  And I said, what type of facts is the government bringing up and how do you feel you can successfully
[3:03:35.940 --> 3:03:36.940]  defend them?
[3:03:36.940 --> 3:03:39.940]  She goes, I know I can defend them because there are no facts to bring up.
[3:03:39.940 --> 3:03:40.940]  It's all hearsay.
[3:03:40.940 --> 3:03:42.940]  So, you know, I thought about this, Alex.
[3:03:42.940 --> 3:03:48.940]  I was one of maybe five, six billion people in the world that got to hear both the prosecution
[3:03:48.940 --> 3:03:52.940]  side, the defense side, and the week before going to trial, with the exception of our
[3:03:52.940 --> 3:03:53.940]  clandestine intelligence agencies.
[3:03:53.940 --> 3:03:57.940]  I got to understand a lot more about how this is going to take place.
[3:03:57.940 --> 3:04:01.940]  This is going to be something that the media is going to report on here and there because
[3:04:01.940 --> 3:04:03.940]  they don't want us to critically think about what happened.
[3:04:03.940 --> 3:04:07.940]  In the total kangaroo, you also told us that they admitted they have no evidence, but Obama
[3:04:07.940 --> 3:04:08.940]  admits that.
[3:04:08.940 --> 3:04:11.940]  He says they may be found not guilty, but we're still going to keep them.
[3:04:11.940 --> 3:04:13.940]  I mean, that's freedom.
[3:04:13.940 --> 3:04:15.940]  Well, I mean, this is what happens.
[3:04:15.940 --> 3:04:17.940]  We have the military commission's act.
[3:04:17.940 --> 3:04:18.940]  We have the Patriot Act.
[3:04:18.940 --> 3:04:25.940]  We have all these different acts which are constantly suffocating Americans' rights and the
[3:04:25.940 --> 3:04:26.940]  Constitution.
[3:04:26.940 --> 3:04:27.940]  What are we going to do about it?
[3:04:27.940 --> 3:04:31.940]  Are we going to stand up and do something about it like you and myself and so many others
[3:04:31.940 --> 3:04:34.940]  or are we going to sit back and say, okay, let them do this?
[3:04:34.940 --> 3:04:35.940]  No.
[3:04:35.940 --> 3:04:37.940]  Manny Bedejo, you are a badass for freedom.
[3:04:37.940 --> 3:04:41.940]  I know you've got some secret stuff you can't talk about right now, but we'll have you
[3:04:41.940 --> 3:04:45.940]  on next week or at the end of the week after that big announcement happens.
[3:04:45.940 --> 3:04:46.940]  Keep it up.
[3:04:46.940 --> 3:04:48.940]  You're going to bring the murderers to justice.
[3:04:48.940 --> 3:04:50.940]  We're right beside you and right behind you.
[3:04:50.940 --> 3:04:51.940]  Go with God.
[3:04:51.940 --> 3:04:52.940]  Bye, Condios.
[3:04:52.940 --> 3:04:53.940]  Thank you, sir.
[3:04:53.940 --> 3:04:54.940]  Thank you, sir.
[3:04:54.940 --> 3:04:55.940]  There goes Manny Bedejo, folks.
[3:04:55.940 --> 3:04:57.940]  We'll be right back with G. Edward Griffin.
[3:04:57.940 --> 3:05:00.940]  Don't want to miss that.
[3:05:00.940 --> 3:05:01.940]  Thank you.
[3:05:30.940 --> 3:05:59.940]  Thank you.
[3:06:01.940 --> 3:06:05.940]  It is a big idea, a new world order.
[3:06:05.940 --> 3:06:10.940]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[3:06:10.940 --> 3:06:13.940]  It's known as the Builder Bird.
[3:06:13.940 --> 3:06:16.940]  Could their objective be world domination?
[3:06:16.940 --> 3:06:19.940]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[3:06:19.940 --> 3:06:25.940]  Now as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80%
[3:06:25.940 --> 3:06:29.940]  of humanity is at hand.
[3:06:29.940 --> 3:06:34.940]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[3:06:34.940 --> 3:06:38.940]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire new world order agenda.
[3:06:38.940 --> 3:06:41.940]  The Builder Bird is making great progress for the world government.
[3:06:41.940 --> 3:06:42.940]  Most people have no idea.
[3:06:42.940 --> 3:06:43.940]  They're not after money.
[3:06:43.940 --> 3:06:44.940]  They have all the money they need.
[3:06:44.940 --> 3:06:45.940]  They're after power.
[3:06:45.940 --> 3:06:46.940]  That's their affidavit.
[3:06:46.940 --> 3:06:53.940]  Order in-game on DVD at prisonplanet.com or infowars.com, or watch it online right now
[3:06:53.940 --> 3:06:54.940]  at prisonplanet.tv.
[3:06:54.940 --> 3:06:58.940]  In-game, blueprint for global enslaved.
[3:06:58.940 --> 3:07:00.940]  You have been warned.
[3:07:00.940 --> 3:07:06.940]  Most people know that drinking pure high alkaline pH water is the most important factor in maintaining
[3:07:06.940 --> 3:07:08.940]  high energy and vibrant health.
[3:07:08.940 --> 3:07:12.940]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 8 or higher.
[3:07:12.940 --> 3:07:17.940]  Alchivision plasma pH drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline minerals.
[3:07:17.940 --> 3:07:23.940]  Using plasma pH drops is the best way to make your water alkaline to help you get rid of acid
[3:07:23.940 --> 3:07:25.940]  and regain your health and energy.
[3:07:25.940 --> 3:07:30.940]  Simply put 10 drops in the water you drink to raise the pH to a healthy level.
[3:07:30.940 --> 3:07:35.940]  Alkalizing water helps your body rid itself of acidic waste and increases the oxygen content
[3:07:35.940 --> 3:07:36.940]  of your body.
[3:07:36.940 --> 3:07:42.940]  Disease organisms like bacteria, viruses and cancer cannot survive in an alkaline high pH
[3:07:42.940 --> 3:07:43.940]  environment.
[3:07:43.940 --> 3:07:48.940]  Order your bottle of Alchivision plasma pH drops now by going directly to alchivision.com.
[3:07:48.940 --> 3:07:54.940]  That's alkavision.com or call 2694091776.
[3:07:54.940 --> 3:08:01.940]  2694091776 today.
[3:08:24.940 --> 3:08:34.940]  Well, G. Edward Griffin with Freedom Force International is an icon in the Liberty and
[3:08:34.940 --> 3:08:36.940]  Freedom movement, the Anti-Nual Water Movement.
[3:08:36.940 --> 3:08:44.140]  In fact, he's probably the greatest living person out there who continually on a large
[3:08:44.140 --> 3:08:50.740]  scale on a big platform has made scores of films, presentations, bestselling books, Creature
[3:08:50.740 --> 3:08:55.620]  from Jack O'Island, Traveling the Country of the World, Fighting the Globalist.
[3:08:55.620 --> 3:09:00.180]  And we stand on his shoulders today, but he also stands right beside us because he's
[3:09:00.180 --> 3:09:02.900]  still fighting more than ever.
[3:09:02.900 --> 3:09:07.820]  He's a great gentleman and very articulate and I'm very excited that he's going to be
[3:09:07.820 --> 3:09:10.500]  interviewed in my newest Obama film.
[3:09:10.500 --> 3:09:16.900]  He is the last interview for this film that has 14 interviews right now.
[3:09:16.900 --> 3:09:19.700]  And one of them is a big surprise interview I'm going to leave till right before its
[3:09:19.700 --> 3:09:27.620]  release, but just so many great people in this film.
[3:09:27.620 --> 3:09:30.300]  And so we're very excited about that also.
[3:09:30.300 --> 3:09:33.180]  Jason Bermas is going out there interviewing him.
[3:09:33.180 --> 3:09:38.180]  He's going to be in Bermas's film, Invisible Empire, with a big role in that exposing kind
[3:09:38.180 --> 3:09:40.060]  of the architecture of the New World Order.
[3:09:40.060 --> 3:09:41.660]  But this just broke over the weekend.
[3:09:41.660 --> 3:09:44.580]  We're all in that daily kind of copied our story, which we're glad.
[3:09:44.580 --> 3:09:46.220]  All we care about is exposing it.
[3:09:46.220 --> 3:09:49.900]  The original place was Front Page Magazine in February, but nobody believed it because
[3:09:49.900 --> 3:09:51.820]  David Horowitz is somewhat discredited.
[3:09:51.820 --> 3:09:57.180]  But we got the actual textbook and we have the scans of it and it's up on infowars.com.
[3:09:57.180 --> 3:10:01.700]  Obama's science advisor called for planetary regime to enforce a totalitarian population
[3:10:01.700 --> 3:10:09.380]  control, implants to control us, CPS taking all children at birth, a planetary government
[3:10:09.380 --> 3:10:16.660]  of green police, forced drugging of the water and of the food.
[3:10:16.660 --> 3:10:18.220]  And this is a government plan.
[3:10:18.220 --> 3:10:26.780]  The book is, as you see on screen at PrismPlanet.tv, EcoScience, Population, Resources, Environment.
[3:10:26.780 --> 3:10:32.620]  And he co-wrote this with Paul R. Erlich, who was one of Bush's chief advisors.
[3:10:32.620 --> 3:10:36.260]  So this is bipartisan.
[3:10:36.260 --> 3:10:40.100]  Front Page Magazine and the Neocons are acting like it's a liberal issue, though I have to
[3:10:40.100 --> 3:10:42.180]  admit the Democrats are more overtly.
[3:10:42.180 --> 3:10:45.620]  You Genesis, you know, Margaret Sanger is praised by the black community because she
[3:10:45.620 --> 3:10:47.300]  called black subhuman.
[3:10:47.300 --> 3:10:53.500]  That's the sick twisted crate like Schwarzenegger gets ADL awards because he says he wants
[3:10:53.500 --> 3:10:54.500]  to be like Hitler.
[3:10:54.500 --> 3:10:57.580]  But if you fight Hitler, then the ADL attacks you.
[3:10:57.580 --> 3:11:00.900]  Reality is much stranger than fiction, as they say.
[3:11:00.900 --> 3:11:04.500]  So I wanted to get Gia Borgriffin out of the gates to talk about this.
[3:11:04.500 --> 3:11:11.900]  And overall, the big eugenics agenda, the plan, the carbon tax, which we couldn't see
[3:11:11.900 --> 3:11:17.780]  until they passed it, home inspections, federal zoning, one child policies.
[3:11:17.780 --> 3:11:26.820]  I have USA Today here in my stack that says that, in fact, put it on screen for folks.
[3:11:26.820 --> 3:11:32.220]  It says that, oh, the bad economy is good for the carbon footprint, command destruction,
[3:11:32.220 --> 3:11:36.460]  how they want to bring us back to a rewilding, a neo feudalism, a serfdom.
[3:11:36.460 --> 3:11:40.180]  Gia Borgriffin, author of The Creature from Jack O'Liland, thanks for being here with
[3:11:40.180 --> 3:11:41.180]  us.
[3:11:41.180 --> 3:11:42.180]  Well, thanks for inviting me, Alex.
[3:11:42.180 --> 3:11:47.260]  I really appreciate that very kind introduction, but it scares the heck out of me because I
[3:11:47.260 --> 3:11:50.620]  think people expect too much.
[3:11:50.620 --> 3:11:51.980]  No brag, just fact.
[3:11:51.980 --> 3:11:52.980]  That's what John Wayne said.
[3:11:52.980 --> 3:11:56.980]  And people need to know the testament of the great work you've done in 40 plus years.
[3:11:56.980 --> 3:11:59.460]  In fact, briefly, how long have you been fighting the globalist?
[3:11:59.460 --> 3:12:00.460]  How'd you wake up to them?
[3:12:00.460 --> 3:12:01.460]  And then let's get into eugenics.
[3:12:01.460 --> 3:12:07.140]  Well, the actual year of my beginning of awakening was 1959.
[3:12:07.140 --> 3:12:12.500]  And that's when I began to read some things that were upstream, not the same stuff that
[3:12:12.500 --> 3:12:15.220]  I was seeing on the media.
[3:12:15.220 --> 3:12:18.180]  And by 1960, I was in full swing.
[3:12:18.180 --> 3:12:20.820]  So I've been in those things since 1960.
[3:12:20.820 --> 3:12:21.820]  Amazing.
[3:12:21.820 --> 3:12:24.540]  So we're talking about almost 50 years.
[3:12:24.540 --> 3:12:26.820]  Yeah, really.
[3:12:26.820 --> 3:12:27.820]  Tom flies.
[3:12:27.820 --> 3:12:29.820]  I hope I look as good as you when I'm your age.
[3:12:29.820 --> 3:12:30.820]  You're us.
[3:12:30.820 --> 3:12:32.420]  What a gentleman you are.
[3:12:32.420 --> 3:12:33.420]  No, no, no.
[3:12:33.420 --> 3:12:34.420]  Your hands are double.
[3:12:34.420 --> 3:12:36.820]  I was just going to send you a pair of glasses in the morning, but...
[3:12:36.820 --> 3:12:37.820]  Okay.
[3:12:37.820 --> 3:12:39.820]  And we're going to fire your website coming out in a few minutes.
[3:12:39.820 --> 3:12:40.820]  So folks, you're ready for that.
[3:12:40.820 --> 3:12:43.860]  You have Freedom Force International taking action against these globalists.
[3:12:43.860 --> 3:12:47.900]  But eugenics, I mean, in my research, everything leads to that.
[3:12:47.900 --> 3:12:52.020]  Our entire society is built for a social engineering grid.
[3:12:52.020 --> 3:12:57.260]  Break that down from your 60 years of research and what their in-game is in light of this
[3:12:57.260 --> 3:13:02.700]  government textbook, internal textbook, it's now come out written by Bush's advisor and
[3:13:02.700 --> 3:13:07.460]  Obama's advisor, calling for a planetary government to kill us.
[3:13:07.460 --> 3:13:11.940]  Well, I had two thoughts as you were introducing the topic.
[3:13:11.940 --> 3:13:17.660]  And one of the thoughts is that even though I was not aware of this very latest development
[3:13:17.660 --> 3:13:23.100]  which you announced, it does not surprise me in the least because it's just more of
[3:13:23.100 --> 3:13:24.100]  the same.
[3:13:24.100 --> 3:13:30.220]  The first thought has to do with, if you understand what the ideology is of these people who have
[3:13:30.220 --> 3:13:34.740]  been running our government for many years, it's called collectivism.
[3:13:34.740 --> 3:13:38.740]  And if you understand what that entails, then you know right away what these people are
[3:13:38.740 --> 3:13:42.740]  going to do because that's based upon their ideology.
[3:13:42.740 --> 3:13:48.340]  The ideology is that they must have total control over the entire population to manipulate
[3:13:48.340 --> 3:13:52.620]  it in any way they see fit, always in the name of, for the greater good of the greater
[3:13:52.620 --> 3:13:58.460]  number, always supposedly for your own good, but with absolute dominance at the top.
[3:13:58.460 --> 3:14:02.820]  And so once you understand that's their mindset and that they think that that's a very good
[3:14:02.820 --> 3:14:06.020]  thing, well then you can predict what's going to happen.
[3:14:06.020 --> 3:14:11.020]  They're going to want to control not only your health, but your reproductive rights,
[3:14:11.020 --> 3:14:15.460]  they'll control who will survive and who will be exterminated, they'll control what
[3:14:15.460 --> 3:14:19.340]  you do for a living, where you live, how much you eat, what you think, you know, all of
[3:14:19.340 --> 3:14:24.420]  these things because you become a clog in a giant machine.
[3:14:24.420 --> 3:14:29.460]  So the first thought that crossed my mind was that, okay, well here comes eugenics again.
[3:14:29.460 --> 3:14:34.780]  That's always happened in every collectivist regime on this planet, whether it be communism
[3:14:34.780 --> 3:14:41.220]  or fascism or Nazism or some of these other isms in Asia and Africa right now.
[3:14:41.220 --> 3:14:44.540]  That's part of the animal, that's what it does.
[3:14:44.540 --> 3:14:49.700]  The other thought, you mentioned it, is that this is not a partisan issue at all.
[3:14:49.700 --> 3:14:54.580]  You'll find this mentality in both the Republican and the Democrat parties because both parties
[3:14:54.580 --> 3:14:56.980]  are dominated by collectivists.
[3:14:56.980 --> 3:15:02.460]  So one of the things we have to do is strip out that concept that Republicans and Democrats
[3:15:02.460 --> 3:15:05.220]  oppose each other on anything significant.
[3:15:05.220 --> 3:15:09.100]  So those are the thoughts that crossed my mind and, you know, once people get the picture
[3:15:09.100 --> 3:15:14.380]  of this and they understand that collectivism is the great destroyer of their freedom, then
[3:15:14.380 --> 3:15:19.100]  they won't fall for this nonsense about, well, are they Republicans or are they Democrats
[3:15:19.100 --> 3:15:22.100]  doing this?
[3:15:22.100 --> 3:15:27.860]  I want you to elaborate on this because you have these big monopoly capitalists who always
[3:15:27.860 --> 3:15:32.700]  advertise their free market, but really what they want is big governments, big systems
[3:15:32.700 --> 3:15:37.900]  to shut down their competition to bring in control and then because they are collectivists,
[3:15:37.900 --> 3:15:41.220]  they collect our wealth and give it to themselves and then use the little bit they give back
[3:15:41.220 --> 3:15:47.420]  to us to domesticate us, then why should they even want us here in their collectivist model
[3:15:47.420 --> 3:15:48.420]  of everything shared?
[3:15:48.420 --> 3:15:52.380]  Well, they want to get rid of people so there's more for the few that are left.
[3:15:52.380 --> 3:15:54.820]  This is their whole social engineering goal.
[3:15:54.820 --> 3:15:58.820]  Well, there is a certain element of that in their thinking.
[3:15:58.820 --> 3:16:03.100]  They do want to limit the population because they're afraid that if the population gets
[3:16:03.100 --> 3:16:06.300]  too large, it becomes unmanageable.
[3:16:06.300 --> 3:16:11.740]  Their primary concern is how to manage the population, like a herd of cattle.
[3:16:11.740 --> 3:16:16.180]  If the herd gets too big, you know, you have trouble managing it, it could break out the
[3:16:16.180 --> 3:16:21.580]  boundaries of the North Forty someplace, so there's a certain element to keep the size
[3:16:21.580 --> 3:16:27.420]  of the herd down, but the other element is that they need workers.
[3:16:27.420 --> 3:16:33.660]  They want people out there producing and serving so that they can create all of the fine things
[3:16:33.660 --> 3:16:36.060]  of life which the elite will enjoy.
[3:16:36.060 --> 3:16:39.340]  They want a working class and they want a servitude class.
[3:16:39.340 --> 3:16:40.340]  And they want our women.
[3:16:40.340 --> 3:16:42.220]  I mean, they don't want to kill all of us.
[3:16:42.220 --> 3:16:43.220]  Just 80%.
[3:16:43.220 --> 3:16:48.220]  Well, I don't know what the number is, but whatever it is, they have no qualms about
[3:16:48.220 --> 3:16:49.220]  it.
[3:16:49.220 --> 3:16:50.220]  That's for sure.
[3:16:50.220 --> 3:16:54.460]  Well, you know, the United Nations Biological Diversity Assessment 96 says a world population
[3:16:54.460 --> 3:16:55.620]  reduction of 80%.
[3:16:55.620 --> 3:17:00.340]  80 is the number you get from Ted Turner and people, but yeah, I mean, some say even more,
[3:17:00.340 --> 3:17:01.340]  some say less.
[3:17:01.340 --> 3:17:02.340]  Yeah.
[3:17:02.340 --> 3:17:06.300]  But it is, if they wanted to reduce it 5%, the principle is the same.
[3:17:06.300 --> 3:17:09.180]  Yeah, which is total dictatorial power.
[3:17:09.180 --> 3:17:12.620]  Yeah, over who lives and who dies, just because of the numbers.
[3:17:12.620 --> 3:17:17.300]  How would you say their program's going right now, watching it closely for 60 years?
[3:17:17.300 --> 3:17:21.940]  I mean, to me, watching it for 15 or so, it looks like they've got the power, they're
[3:17:21.940 --> 3:17:24.860]  steering things, but they don't have total control.
[3:17:24.860 --> 3:17:29.020]  And as they build their new world order, it's falling apart as fast as they build it.
[3:17:29.020 --> 3:17:31.820]  Well, yes, I can see elements of that.
[3:17:31.820 --> 3:17:36.780]  It's certainly not, it's not all in the bag, that's for sure, but I see it as an accelerating
[3:17:36.780 --> 3:17:43.940]  process and it worries the heck out of me because once the dam starts to break and it
[3:17:43.940 --> 3:17:50.500]  looks to me like it's breaking up now, the pieces falling out start becoming larger and
[3:17:50.500 --> 3:17:52.020]  they start falling faster.
[3:17:52.020 --> 3:17:57.940]  And so this great outpouring of water from behind the dam, when I say that I'm thinking
[3:17:57.940 --> 3:18:03.900]  of our freedoms, our freedoms are being flooded out through a huge breach in the dam and it
[3:18:03.900 --> 3:18:08.060]  seems to be going faster and faster and so I'm very concerned about that.
[3:18:08.060 --> 3:18:12.580]  We could come up with some event or series of events almost any day, which they could
[3:18:12.580 --> 3:18:18.660]  justify, they could use as justification for closing down on what's left of our freedoms.
[3:18:18.660 --> 3:18:20.820]  They're definitely planning to do that.
[3:18:20.820 --> 3:18:25.260]  It's just a question of when are they going to do it, what events are they going to use
[3:18:25.260 --> 3:18:26.260]  for that.
[3:18:26.260 --> 3:18:31.380]  By the same token, as you say, it looks like their system is falling apart, there's certainly
[3:18:31.380 --> 3:18:33.580]  a lot of disagreement among them.
[3:18:33.580 --> 3:18:39.740]  There's a lot of infighting between them to see who is going to have the ultimate power.
[3:18:39.740 --> 3:18:41.980]  But I guess that's part of it.
[3:18:41.980 --> 3:18:46.580]  They've got to destroy a lot of stuff to build the new system where they destroy everything,
[3:18:46.580 --> 3:18:52.660]  then only their central hubs are left and so by extension, by the rule of heavenly bodies
[3:18:52.660 --> 3:18:56.540]  or gravitational pull, it will pull everything into it.
[3:18:56.540 --> 3:19:02.380]  Yeah, that's a perfect analogy, I think, and also we have to remember that certain subgroups
[3:19:02.380 --> 3:19:08.580]  within the collectivist movement actually advocate conflict within their own ranks.
[3:19:08.580 --> 3:19:11.740]  Adolf Hitler was one of those who was quite adamant on that.
[3:19:11.740 --> 3:19:15.900]  He said, it's good that we fight within our ranks because only the strongest of us will
[3:19:15.900 --> 3:19:20.900]  survive and we need only strong people in our movement, so there's a lot of that going
[3:19:20.900 --> 3:19:21.900]  on too.
[3:19:21.900 --> 3:19:29.900]  And I think that kind of actually pigeonholes them and trips them up a lot.
[3:19:29.900 --> 3:19:33.900]  Well, let's hope it does.
[3:19:33.900 --> 3:19:37.540]  The point is, I think to all of this, is that we certainly cannot sit back and just wait
[3:19:37.540 --> 3:19:41.100]  for it to crumble because they've got plans for us that we're not going to like.
[3:19:41.100 --> 3:19:43.100]  We have to fight this with everything we have.
[3:19:43.100 --> 3:19:48.060]  Well, let's talk about what the plans are versus our plans and also how you see the
[3:19:48.060 --> 3:19:52.700]  economic collapse engineered or not, what's happening with the global carbon tax, what
[3:19:52.700 --> 3:19:54.620]  life will be like under that.
[3:19:54.620 --> 3:19:57.940]  I mean, this is the actual Soviet Union's what I'd call it we're going into, but we'll
[3:19:57.940 --> 3:20:01.540]  get G. Ebergriffen's take on that in just a moment, stay with us.
[3:20:01.540 --> 3:20:04.820]  When you hear the words water purification, what comes to mind?
[3:20:04.820 --> 3:20:08.740]  If it's Berkey water purification systems, this message is for you.
[3:20:08.740 --> 3:20:13.420]  Did you know that over 60% of municipal water contains fluoride, had less than two cents

[3:22:01.820 --> 3:22:07.420]  On September 11, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to Ground Zero
[3:22:07.420 --> 3:22:10.980]  and we knew what to do, or at least we thought we did.
[3:22:10.980 --> 3:22:16.260]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform
[3:22:16.260 --> 3:22:17.900]  to tell their story.
[3:22:17.900 --> 3:22:26.860]  Whitman, EVA director on the 18th made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[3:22:26.860 --> 3:22:31.620]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 Truth as brave souls throughout the world

[3:25:14.980 --> 3:25:20.540]  to allow the people too much time to think about it, and to develop opposition.
[3:25:20.540 --> 3:25:22.500]  Can we get it all done?
[3:25:22.500 --> 3:25:26.700]  Right now, I think it's come to the end of, almost to the end of the honeymoon in the
[3:25:26.700 --> 3:25:28.900]  Obama administration.
[3:25:28.900 --> 3:25:33.740]  In the first few months, they could do just about anything they wanted to.
[3:25:33.740 --> 3:25:36.460]  People would say, well, we don't know, give them a chance, let them work it out and so
[3:25:36.460 --> 3:25:40.540]  forth, but they know that they didn't get too much done right away, that later on opposition
[3:25:40.540 --> 3:25:42.340]  might be developed to it.
[3:25:42.340 --> 3:25:43.540]  So I think that's part of it.
[3:25:43.540 --> 3:25:48.180]  And the other thing is, it's got a lot more to do with this one administration versus
[3:25:48.180 --> 3:25:49.940]  another administration.
[3:25:49.940 --> 3:25:55.940]  These people who are dreaming up this legislation and writing these laws, they're not thinking
[3:25:55.940 --> 3:26:01.060]  as Republicans or Democrats, they're thinking as globalist collectivists trying to create
[3:26:01.060 --> 3:26:02.060]  the new world order.
[3:26:02.060 --> 3:26:06.060]  That's their mission, they want to get that thing built, they want to get on with it,
[3:26:06.060 --> 3:26:07.060]  you know?
[3:26:07.060 --> 3:26:08.380]  That's their dream.
[3:26:08.380 --> 3:26:12.100]  And meanwhile, all the folks back here at home are still thinking in terms of these people,
[3:26:12.100 --> 3:26:15.700]  well, why would a good Republican do that, or why would a good Democrat do that?
[3:26:15.700 --> 3:26:19.900]  You know, and they don't get it, that this has got nothing at all to do with partisan
[3:26:19.900 --> 3:26:20.900]  politics.
[3:26:20.900 --> 3:26:25.340]  So I think they're in a hurry, so that too many of the American people don't wake up,
[3:26:25.340 --> 3:26:28.180]  and they get it all done.
[3:26:28.180 --> 3:26:33.460]  Continue along that line, Jabra Griffin.
[3:26:33.460 --> 3:26:39.980]  Well, I don't know what more I could say about that, except that we're living in a time where
[3:26:39.980 --> 3:26:45.180]  events are moving very rapidly, I guess people have always said that throughout history,
[3:26:45.180 --> 3:26:52.340]  but also I think that it's true that because of technology, things do move more rapidly
[3:26:52.340 --> 3:27:00.700]  as the years go by, and I think the time that they figure to wrap up the new world order
[3:27:00.700 --> 3:27:03.100]  is definitely within this generation.
[3:27:03.100 --> 3:27:08.100]  It used to be, I think, that they were thinking in terms of, well, two or three generations
[3:27:08.100 --> 3:27:13.300]  down the line, we'll get it all done, but now I think they've decided it's this generation,
[3:27:13.300 --> 3:27:19.020]  which means within this 20-year timespan, probably less than that.
[3:27:19.020 --> 3:27:27.420]  And so it's moving very rapidly, and we were talking just a moment ago about can we turn
[3:27:27.420 --> 3:27:28.420]  this around?
[3:27:28.420 --> 3:27:29.420]  Are we going to win?
[3:27:29.420 --> 3:27:30.420]  Are we going to lose?
[3:27:30.420 --> 3:27:31.420]  What's going to happen?
[3:27:31.420 --> 3:27:32.420]  Everybody wants to think, what do I do?
[3:27:32.420 --> 3:27:33.420]  How do I prepare?
[3:27:33.420 --> 3:27:34.420]  What can I do for my family?
[3:27:34.420 --> 3:27:40.740]  All of these things, and nothing wrong with that kind of thinking, it's realistic thinking.
[3:27:40.740 --> 3:27:44.660]  But the main question is, are we going to win or are we going to lose, and my feeling
[3:27:44.660 --> 3:27:49.660]  is very strong on that, is that we are definitely going to win this battle because freedom will
[3:27:49.660 --> 3:27:50.660]  always win out.
[3:27:50.660 --> 3:27:54.260]  But the question, the annoying question, is how long will it take?
[3:27:54.260 --> 3:27:56.940]  Is it going to be by the next election?
[3:27:56.940 --> 3:27:59.700]  No, it's definitely not going to be the next election.
[3:27:59.700 --> 3:28:01.300]  How bad is it going to get?
[3:28:01.300 --> 3:28:05.700]  And one big problem with winning is people are in this instant gratification, give me
[3:28:05.700 --> 3:28:08.540]  the Wendy's hamburger in 10 seconds or I'm angry.
[3:28:08.540 --> 3:28:10.500]  I catch myself even like this.
[3:28:10.500 --> 3:28:13.200]  It takes time to grow a orchard.
[3:28:13.200 --> 3:28:14.780]  It takes time to put in a garden.
[3:28:14.780 --> 3:28:17.100]  It takes time to build a new old order.
[3:28:17.100 --> 3:28:19.220]  It takes time to defeat it.
[3:28:19.220 --> 3:28:20.940]  And things are moving very quickly now.
[3:28:20.940 --> 3:28:22.820]  We're having great victories.
[3:28:22.820 --> 3:28:26.740]  People need to be more positive and realize things don't happen instantly.
[3:28:26.740 --> 3:28:28.460]  And I agree with you, we're going to win.
[3:28:28.460 --> 3:28:32.340]  The question is how bad will it get, how many of us will be enslaved when we talk about
[3:28:32.340 --> 3:28:34.420]  if they win, what is it like?
[3:28:34.420 --> 3:28:38.140]  It's like living under Joe Stalin with a high-tech overlay, isn't it, G.E. Evergreen?
[3:28:38.140 --> 3:28:43.420]  Yeah, I think that's a good analogy, yes, high-tech overlay, a lot more effective means
[3:28:43.420 --> 3:28:48.900]  of controlling people, controlling their thoughts, controlling their health, their movement,
[3:28:48.900 --> 3:28:52.700]  and a lot more sophisticated weapons to put down opposition.
[3:28:52.700 --> 3:28:57.140]  Yeah, that's the high-tech overlay that makes it really scary.
[3:28:57.140 --> 3:29:01.100]  But yes, back to the theme, which is how long is it going to take?
[3:29:01.100 --> 3:29:05.140]  That's been one of the main points of Freedom Force International, is that we have the long
[3:29:05.140 --> 3:29:08.340]  view of history, and a lot of people get very impatient with that.
[3:29:08.340 --> 3:29:09.660]  I can understand that.
[3:29:09.660 --> 3:29:13.660]  I used to be impatient with that point of view when I was a young guy.
[3:29:13.660 --> 3:29:17.220]  I remember we were talking a moment ago, when did I start down this path?
[3:29:17.220 --> 3:29:22.340]  Well, back in 1960, and I remember back in the 60s, listening to some of the old-timers
[3:29:22.340 --> 3:29:25.620]  say, well, this is going to take quite a while to turn around, and I kept saying, the heck
[3:29:25.620 --> 3:29:29.820]  it is, wait till I get in there, you know, I'll turn this thing around, and right away.
[3:29:29.820 --> 3:29:33.820]  Well, it turns out that the old-timers were right.
[3:29:33.820 --> 3:29:37.980]  It turns out, hold on, 60 years is a blink of an eye, though, you've done a lot to start
[3:29:37.980 --> 3:29:39.140]  turning the ship.
[3:29:39.140 --> 3:29:42.100]  You have influenced tens of millions, G. Evergryphon.
[3:29:42.100 --> 3:29:51.900]  Stay there, my friend, quick break, we'll come right back with G. Evergryphon.
[3:29:51.900 --> 3:30:01.020]  Here on the march, the empire's on the run, Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[3:30:01.020 --> 3:30:05.020]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones, and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[3:30:05.020 --> 3:30:07.300]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[3:30:07.300 --> 3:30:12.940]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals
[3:30:12.940 --> 3:30:15.940]  in pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[3:30:15.940 --> 3:30:20.060]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental
[3:30:20.060 --> 3:30:21.380]  system diseases.
[3:30:21.380 --> 3:30:23.220]  Now what are you going to do about it?
[3:30:23.220 --> 3:30:27.980]  The Acola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of
[3:30:27.980 --> 3:30:29.740]  you and your family's drinking water.
[3:30:29.740 --> 3:30:34.460]  The Acola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere
[3:30:34.460 --> 3:30:39.860]  and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultra-violent light sterilization
[3:30:39.860 --> 3:30:40.860]  techniques.
[3:30:40.860 --> 3:30:44.220]  That's right, clean water, right from the air you breathe.

[3:31:01.180 --> 3:31:08.220]  It's here after a year in production and traveling the distant lands.
[3:31:08.220 --> 3:31:10.500]  Mighty Film Terror Storm is complete.
[3:31:10.500 --> 3:31:14.220]  The shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating
[3:31:14.220 --> 3:31:18.900]  terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[3:31:18.900 --> 3:31:24.260]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London
[3:31:24.260 --> 3:31:26.380]  were carried out by British intelligence.
[3:31:26.380 --> 3:31:30.580]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to
[3:31:30.580 --> 3:31:36.900]  disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information,
[3:31:36.900 --> 3:31:37.900]  and much, much more.
[3:31:37.900 --> 3:31:42.020]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[3:31:42.020 --> 3:31:44.260]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[3:31:44.260 --> 3:31:48.740]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[3:33:06.940 --> 3:33:21.140]  You take them all the man, you put them in control, and put them in control.
[3:33:21.140 --> 3:33:42.260]  Just like the fiber, turn rats loose, elite create their own crises, and once you start
[3:33:42.260 --> 3:33:52.260]  playing to their tune, crank it up.
[3:33:52.260 --> 3:34:03.260]  Just like the fiber, turn rats loose, elite create their own crises, and dance like a
[3:34:03.260 --> 3:34:13.260]  robot, it's metal break a road.
[3:34:13.260 --> 3:34:25.260]  You try to take us boss, before the head explodes.
[3:34:25.260 --> 3:34:30.260]  All right, let's go ahead and go back to G. Edward President.
[3:34:30.260 --> 3:34:34.260]  G. Edward Firehouse, the website for folks who want to check out all your great films,
[3:34:34.260 --> 3:34:40.260]  books, videos, and materials, and people who want to get involved in Freedom Force International.
[3:34:40.260 --> 3:34:42.980]  Well, how do they do that?
[3:34:42.980 --> 3:34:47.860]  I guess it's time to plug a couple of websites.
[3:34:47.860 --> 3:34:53.900]  Our commercial website, as you know, it's called the Reality Zone, and it's easy to
[3:34:53.900 --> 3:34:54.900]  remember.
[3:34:54.900 --> 3:34:58.900]  RealityZone.com, we've got about a hundred different items there, some of my books and
[3:34:58.900 --> 3:35:03.020]  video programs and audio recordings, plus we carry the good stuff from other people
[3:35:03.020 --> 3:35:04.020]  as well.
[3:35:04.020 --> 3:35:06.660]  But that's a commercial site, plenty of information.
[3:35:06.660 --> 3:35:11.540]  If you're a reader or you like to watch videos, there's enough there for almost a year of
[3:35:11.540 --> 3:35:12.540]  your time of study.
[3:35:12.540 --> 3:35:17.900]  But if you want to get involved in an organization that's trying to do something about it and
[3:35:17.900 --> 3:35:23.380]  trying to recapture control of our political system, then you want to go to the Freedom
[3:35:23.380 --> 3:35:30.620]  Force site, and that's FreedomForceInternational.org, and I can't tell you too much about it because
[3:35:30.620 --> 3:35:34.620]  it takes too much time to tell you about it, except that there's a plan there to do something
[3:35:34.620 --> 3:35:40.540]  about it, to not just complain, not just to read another book, but to actually acquire
[3:35:40.540 --> 3:35:46.300]  or reacquire, I should say, reacquire power over the political system of all of the countries
[3:35:46.300 --> 3:35:47.300]  to do it.
[3:35:47.300 --> 3:35:51.260]  That's right, we have to infiltrate the system like they've done to us.
[3:35:51.260 --> 3:35:55.900]  I wouldn't say infiltrate, that's kind of negative connotation to it.
[3:35:55.900 --> 3:35:58.020]  We should be there all the time anyway.
[3:35:58.020 --> 3:36:04.260]  I agree, but I mean, they covertly infiltrated, and I think in a war, it's good to be overt,
[3:36:04.260 --> 3:36:08.860]  but if people choose to be covert, we could send a lot of secret documents, and I mean,
[3:36:08.860 --> 3:36:09.860]  that is infiltration.
[3:36:09.860 --> 3:36:12.780]  That's the American people re-infiltrating their own government.
[3:36:12.780 --> 3:36:17.660]  Well, I would have to agree with the principle, we have to go back to where we should have
[3:36:17.660 --> 3:36:23.500]  been all along, when you've got self-government, you better be involved in government, not
[3:36:23.500 --> 3:36:27.180]  just turn it over to somebody else, because then it's not self-government anymore.
[3:36:27.180 --> 3:36:30.780]  Well, I'll say this, the government, it's out of control and illegitimate, no more offshore
[3:36:30.780 --> 3:36:36.100]  banks publicly now, and fraud, they act like we are criminal infiltrators if we try to
[3:36:36.100 --> 3:36:40.020]  go to a city council meeting, or try to go hold a sign up on the street corner, we all
[3:36:40.020 --> 3:36:43.060]  have to exercise that power or lose it.
[3:36:43.060 --> 3:36:46.900]  That's right, we have to be in the political halls of the nation.
[3:36:46.900 --> 3:36:51.660]  The motto of this, sort of the unofficial motto of freedom force is, don't fight city
[3:36:51.660 --> 3:36:57.820]  hall when you can be city hall, and that sums it up, and I'm happy to say that our members
[3:36:57.820 --> 3:37:03.980]  all over the country are gradually getting the idea, and they're successfully moving
[3:37:03.980 --> 3:37:05.620]  into political groups.
[3:37:05.620 --> 3:37:10.060]  And the system is worried, they're put out reports going, there's police, there's military,
[3:37:10.060 --> 3:37:14.740]  there's these anti-fellow reserve people, they're everywhere, they might get us, oh
[3:37:14.740 --> 3:37:15.740]  no!
[3:37:15.740 --> 3:37:22.580]  Well, yeah, they might become mayors of cities, they may become members of city councils,
[3:37:22.580 --> 3:37:28.940]  they may become elected to state positions, they may become chiefs of police, who knows,
[3:37:28.940 --> 3:37:32.940]  they may actually recapture control of their own system, that's the whole idea.
[3:37:32.940 --> 3:37:38.300]  Oh, we don't want to do that, and throw out the evil mayors who are on offshore payrolls
[3:37:38.300 --> 3:37:42.780]  publicly, you know, one thing, not just getting back into government and the system, but also
[3:37:42.780 --> 3:37:47.940]  surveilling corrupt politicians legally, I mean, most of these guys are really corrupt,
[3:37:47.940 --> 3:37:53.620]  you'll catch them with hookers, gambling, stealing, weird stuff, if you just go out
[3:37:53.620 --> 3:37:58.380]  and surveil corrupt people, folks, they're doing evil, you know, good people are just
[3:37:58.380 --> 3:38:02.900]  at home barbecuing and hanging out with the family, these globalists are all scum, and
[3:38:02.900 --> 3:38:07.460]  they're all degenerates, you don't do bad things in life unless you're overall bad,
[3:38:07.460 --> 3:38:09.620]  and you know, I say play hardball with them too.
[3:38:09.620 --> 3:38:14.420]  Well, yeah, it is partly the nature of the beast, this thing we call government, we've
[3:38:14.420 --> 3:38:20.900]  allowed it to grow and grow and become more powerful, and whenever you've got a center
[3:38:20.900 --> 3:38:27.220]  of power like that, it's a magnet for the criminal class, or the predator class, people
[3:38:27.220 --> 3:38:33.540]  who want to take advantage of others just instinctively gravitate to something like
[3:38:33.540 --> 3:38:34.540]  that.
[3:38:34.540 --> 3:38:41.260]  So part of our long range strategy for success and victory that we were talking about is
[3:38:41.260 --> 3:38:47.700]  to dismantle that magnet so that it won't attract that criminal class anymore.
[3:38:47.700 --> 3:38:53.020]  Yeah, if there's not a big government, there's no power mass or levers for a psycho or control
[3:38:53.020 --> 3:38:57.780]  freak to get control of it, we build these giant government systems, they're going to
[3:38:57.780 --> 3:39:00.900]  be taken over by crooks if they weren't built by them to begin with.
[3:39:00.900 --> 3:39:05.620]  That's right, so people haven't thought that all the way through, they think that the solution
[3:39:05.620 --> 3:39:11.460]  to corruption in government is to make government stronger, more investigations, more laws and
[3:39:11.460 --> 3:39:16.420]  so forth, and that's just the opposite of the solution, that the structure should start
[3:39:16.420 --> 3:39:22.780]  to be dismantled, and all of these tools that they have for controlling the lives of its
[3:39:22.780 --> 3:39:24.980]  citizens need to be just eliminated.
[3:39:24.980 --> 3:39:30.660]  And then citizens will automatically start killing snakes in their own backyards of calling
[3:39:30.660 --> 3:39:34.780]  the government to do it, and then citizens will start putting up their own fences and
[3:39:34.780 --> 3:39:38.860]  start learning how to defend themselves and start, and then the wealth and money and ideas
[3:39:38.860 --> 3:39:44.100]  go back into the free market instead of, I look at the general public, they're totally
[3:39:44.100 --> 3:39:45.100]  domesticated.
[3:39:45.100 --> 3:39:50.660]  I'm domesticated, controlled to my dad, compared to my dad, he's domesticated compared to
[3:39:50.660 --> 3:39:51.660]  his dad.
[3:39:51.660 --> 3:39:53.660]  I mean, we really are becoming weaklings.
[3:39:53.660 --> 3:39:58.900]  Yeah, well, that's been part of the strategy, and it's interesting to me because over the
[3:39:58.900 --> 3:40:05.060]  years I've had a chance to study some of the more esoteric literature by these people,
[3:40:05.060 --> 3:40:11.580]  the deep blinkers, the scholars on the collective aside, you don't run into their names often,
[3:40:11.580 --> 3:40:17.460]  but they've written books, they've given speeches and lectures, some of them are in academia,
[3:40:17.460 --> 3:40:23.100]  and they waxed eloquent about how wonderful it would be to domesticate the human rights
[3:40:23.100 --> 3:40:29.580]  and breed out of them all of these aggressive instincts, as they say, and to convert the
[3:40:29.580 --> 3:40:36.500]  human animal into a productive and kind and gentle thing, and of course, they say if they
[3:40:36.500 --> 3:40:41.020]  have to kill a few million people along the way to do that, torture a few, well, it's
[3:40:41.020 --> 3:40:46.980]  okay, the end justifies the means, it's pretty amazing how they justify these things.
[3:40:46.980 --> 3:40:50.300]  Well, the truth is, when you really meet these liberal collectivists, and they're not really
[3:40:50.300 --> 3:40:55.220]  liberal, but they usually are hiding under that mantle, it's like, yes, we're going
[3:40:55.220 --> 3:40:59.900]  to have to kill a lot, and you see them kind of going, you know, just getting off on it,
[3:40:59.900 --> 3:41:05.700]  and the truth is, they're killer apes in their own view, they're just high functioning psychos
[3:41:05.700 --> 3:41:10.180]  who act like they're these egalitarians, and really, they're just a bunch of lunatic control
[3:41:10.180 --> 3:41:12.660]  freaks that need to be dealt with.
[3:41:12.660 --> 3:41:17.300]  Yeah, I think they're certainly true, a lot of them just like that, they may look very
[3:41:17.300 --> 3:41:24.220]  meek and mild and be wearing bifocals, but there is a killer instinct there, yeah.
[3:41:24.220 --> 3:41:27.740]  And we've got to re-harnize our killer instinct for defense, that's the problem, I found really
[3:41:27.740 --> 3:41:35.100]  intelligent, overconfident, nice friendly people, are gregarious, good-natured, don't
[3:41:35.100 --> 3:41:39.580]  want to get involved, we kind of just sit back, and then there's these little greedy
[3:41:39.580 --> 3:41:44.660]  weak people who want to get in the power and that hate those of us that are strong, and
[3:41:44.660 --> 3:41:49.820]  I found that to be the secret to eugenics, is they sell it to the strong as, oh, we're
[3:41:49.820 --> 3:41:53.740]  just going to make the strong and the healthy have more of the world, which is bad enough
[3:41:53.740 --> 3:41:57.980]  because it always leads to evil, but in truth, they're actually targeting the strong.
[3:41:57.980 --> 3:42:03.900]  Well, yeah, they're targeting, yeah, the strength or the weakness of an individual has nothing
[3:42:03.900 --> 3:42:07.180]  to do with their plan, even though they say that it does.
[3:42:07.180 --> 3:42:14.740]  What their plan is focused on is the ideological orientation of the individual.
[3:42:14.740 --> 3:42:22.460]  Strong or weak, if they support their collectivist agenda, then they are to be defended and preserved.
[3:42:22.460 --> 3:42:27.300]  If they're opposed to the collectivist agenda, then they're alleged to be defective and must
[3:42:27.300 --> 3:42:28.300]  be eliminated.
[3:42:28.300 --> 3:42:34.060]  So, strength or weakness is measured primarily in terms of the degree to which individuals
[3:42:34.060 --> 3:42:35.340]  support their agenda.
[3:42:35.340 --> 3:42:40.660]  But, like an animal farm, when the big stallion workhorse breaks his back trying to make
[3:42:40.660 --> 3:42:45.020]  more money for the pigs, then they load him up and sell him to the glue factory.
[3:42:45.020 --> 3:42:50.260]  So, they also, at the same time, do hate the beautiful, the smart, the intelligent.
[3:42:50.260 --> 3:42:54.180]  Most of these eugenicists are like goblin-like creatures who want to pull everything down.
[3:42:54.180 --> 3:42:58.460]  Yeah, they get to be very analytical about society.
[3:42:58.460 --> 3:43:06.300]  They look at the human being as a machine, something to be controlled and directed.
[3:43:06.300 --> 3:43:12.580]  My mind just went back to that famous line attributed to the Rothschilds I had in my
[3:43:12.580 --> 3:43:13.580]  book.
[3:43:13.580 --> 3:43:19.260]  It said that the rulers of society, and they were referring indirectly to the Rothschilds
[3:43:19.260 --> 3:43:27.380]  in this sense, they look at men as a machine and women as a toy, as a boy.
[3:43:27.380 --> 3:43:30.980]  That's quite an egalitarian view of the world, I would say.
[3:43:30.980 --> 3:43:37.980]  But they do look at men as machines, machines to be controlled and put to work, and if they
[3:43:37.980 --> 3:43:40.700]  don't work well, then destroy them.
[3:43:40.700 --> 3:43:42.260]  Yeah, programmed.
[3:43:42.260 --> 3:43:48.660]  Well, I want to take a few calls for J. Edward Griffin, Ronnie, Rob, Adam, Greg, and Chris,
[3:43:48.660 --> 3:43:49.660]  and that'll be it.
[3:43:49.660 --> 3:43:51.700]  We can take those five, sorry, the others.
[3:43:51.700 --> 3:43:54.860]  But I wanted just to get your view on the carbon tax.
[3:43:54.860 --> 3:43:56.740]  This is wildly unpopular.
[3:43:56.740 --> 3:44:00.940]  I think it's going to blow up in their face, not letting anybody read the bill, 300 pages
[3:44:00.940 --> 3:44:01.940]  of it.
[3:44:01.940 --> 3:44:02.940]  Now we've got it.
[3:44:02.940 --> 3:44:09.300]  They're trying to pass the Senate, federal home inspectors and selective carbon taxes
[3:44:09.300 --> 3:44:10.300]  on who they want.
[3:44:10.300 --> 3:44:14.180]  It was like Obama selectively deciding who can keep their dealerships.
[3:44:14.180 --> 3:44:20.140]  I mean, we're really seeing a takeover and the gas, the honeymoon is running out quick
[3:44:20.140 --> 3:44:21.140]  on this guy.
[3:44:21.140 --> 3:44:26.620]  Well, yes, and I certainly agree that people are fed up with all of it, and this just is
[3:44:26.620 --> 3:44:32.340]  like another straw on the camel's back, but I'm not so sure about whether they're going
[3:44:32.340 --> 3:44:36.900]  to not be allowed to continue, because you know, these people really don't care what
[3:44:36.900 --> 3:44:39.060]  the American people think right now.
[3:44:39.060 --> 3:44:42.060]  They've come to the point where they just sort of go ahead anyway.
[3:44:42.060 --> 3:44:46.660]  I mean, this whole issue of global warming is a perfect example.
[3:44:46.660 --> 3:44:50.260]  I would say that about a year or a year and a half ago, if you were to pull the average
[3:44:50.260 --> 3:44:55.180]  citizen out there, the overwhelming majority of them would say, oh, yes, we've got global
[3:44:55.180 --> 3:44:56.180]  warming.
[3:44:56.180 --> 3:45:00.020]  It's something that's very serious that we've got to do something about it, but now with
[3:45:00.020 --> 3:45:05.660]  all of the scientific evidence that has come out and all of the obvious fact of global
[3:45:05.660 --> 3:45:10.260]  cooling that's been taking place for about a year now, I think if you pull the average
[3:45:10.260 --> 3:45:14.220]  person, they'd say, yeah, there's a bunch of bunk, there's no global warming going on
[3:45:14.220 --> 3:45:15.220]  at all.
[3:45:15.220 --> 3:45:19.380]  And these guys just want to use that as an excuse to have a tax and have more power.
[3:45:19.380 --> 3:45:24.300]  That's the drift of the thinking, but does it stop, does it stop Congress, does it stop
[3:45:24.300 --> 3:45:25.300]  the Senate?
[3:45:25.300 --> 3:45:26.300]  That's the key.
[3:45:26.300 --> 3:45:28.660]  And no, it doesn't even slow them down.
[3:45:28.660 --> 3:45:31.780]  They don't give a damn what the American people think.
[3:45:31.780 --> 3:45:35.220]  They've got their own agenda and they have the power to execute it.
[3:45:35.220 --> 3:45:37.380]  So that should be a wake-up call for people.
[3:45:37.380 --> 3:45:41.460]  But that's the key is that they do just ignore us on every front.
[3:45:41.460 --> 3:45:46.420]  And it's clear, they've made the decision to go ahead and push us into revolution.
[3:45:46.420 --> 3:45:49.220]  That's what their paramilitary North comms ready for.
[3:45:49.220 --> 3:45:53.380]  They've told the police, get ready, the vets, the gun owners are going to attack you.
[3:45:53.380 --> 3:45:57.060]  And it's kind of a self-fulfilling process to further destroy the country.
[3:45:57.060 --> 3:46:02.300]  I'm not saying they're going to go with that, but if they can go to us into physical conflict,
[3:46:02.300 --> 3:46:06.420]  all the better for them.
[3:46:06.420 --> 3:46:08.580]  It's just another form of problem reaction solution.
[3:46:08.580 --> 3:46:09.580]  Your comments on that.
[3:46:09.580 --> 3:46:14.620]  Well, yes, I think that they have anticipated that long ago that that inevitably it would
[3:46:14.620 --> 3:46:17.540]  come to an uprising.
[3:46:17.540 --> 3:46:19.140]  And so they started to prepare for it.
[3:46:19.140 --> 3:46:24.340]  And I think they came to the point about maybe a year, a year and a half ago where they think
[3:46:24.340 --> 3:46:25.340]  that the sooner the better.
[3:46:25.340 --> 3:46:26.900]  Let's get on with it.
[3:46:26.900 --> 3:46:28.300]  Let's close the gate.
[3:46:28.300 --> 3:46:30.820]  Let's have a good excuse for bringing about martial law.
[3:46:30.820 --> 3:46:33.500]  Yeah, let's go people into the streets.
[3:46:33.500 --> 3:46:37.940]  Let's get them wild-eyed full of revolt.
[3:46:37.940 --> 3:46:42.580]  People don't understand the difference between a revolt and a revolution.
[3:46:42.580 --> 3:46:44.700]  Revolts never succeed.
[3:46:44.700 --> 3:46:46.700]  Revolutions sometimes succeed.
[3:46:46.700 --> 3:46:52.260]  And the difference between the two is that revolutions have leadership that they're usually
[3:46:52.260 --> 3:46:58.020]  conducted by governmental units within a governmental entity.
[3:46:58.020 --> 3:46:59.180]  They have manifestos.
[3:46:59.180 --> 3:47:00.180]  They have creeds.
[3:47:00.180 --> 3:47:01.180]  It's an idea.
[3:47:01.180 --> 3:47:04.220]  They have training, funding, communications, a strategy.
[3:47:04.220 --> 3:47:10.340]  They have everything, whereas just plain revolt is where people throw up their hands as they
[3:47:10.340 --> 3:47:11.340]  are sick and tired.
[3:47:11.340 --> 3:47:15.660]  I'm not going to put up with it anymore, and they grab their musket and go out in the street.
[3:47:15.660 --> 3:47:18.300]  Well, they're easily mowed down.
[3:47:18.300 --> 3:47:20.300]  The American Revolution was not a revolt.
[3:47:20.300 --> 3:47:21.300]  It was a revolution.
[3:47:21.300 --> 3:47:24.380]  It was fought by the continental governments.
[3:47:24.380 --> 3:47:26.180]  The colonies had their militia.
[3:47:26.180 --> 3:47:28.700]  They had their training, their leaders, their ammunition.
[3:47:28.700 --> 3:47:31.500]  They had strategy, funding, and they had all of that.
[3:47:31.500 --> 3:47:35.020]  And they had a code, and they had a manifesto.
[3:47:35.020 --> 3:47:37.540]  Yes, but they had leadership.
[3:47:37.540 --> 3:47:43.260]  Their leaders in the colonial representative governments declared on their behalf and so
[3:47:43.260 --> 3:47:44.260]  forth.
[3:47:44.260 --> 3:47:45.260]  You can argue with some of that.
[3:47:45.260 --> 3:47:47.260]  The point is that it was organized today.
[3:47:47.260 --> 3:47:48.940]  And that also landed legitimacy.
[3:47:48.940 --> 3:47:49.940]  Yes.
[3:47:49.940 --> 3:47:55.740]  Today, these revolts that people are urging on the American people are just suicidal.
[3:47:55.740 --> 3:47:57.940]  That just makes me sick to see it.
[3:47:57.940 --> 3:48:00.940]  Well, I actually think a revolt is going to chew up a lot of military and police, but
[3:48:00.940 --> 3:48:02.380]  the globalists don't care.
[3:48:02.380 --> 3:48:07.460]  That would make the government the victim, and then the real oppression comes in.
[3:48:07.460 --> 3:48:10.740]  And that's why I always see these federal operatives trying to hype it, but they never
[3:48:10.740 --> 3:48:11.740]  get in trouble.
[3:48:11.740 --> 3:48:15.020]  Folks, if you're not a federal operative and you call for violence, they come after
[3:48:15.020 --> 3:48:16.020]  you.
[3:48:16.020 --> 3:48:17.020]  They only...
[3:48:17.020 --> 3:48:19.300]  But they have people out there always calling for violence and saying, why doesn't Alex
[3:48:19.300 --> 3:48:20.300]  call for violence?
[3:48:20.300 --> 3:48:21.980]  He's a coward.
[3:48:21.980 --> 3:48:24.940]  Those are feds, folks, guaranteed.
[3:48:24.940 --> 3:48:28.140]  They want to prematurely have us launch our revolution.
[3:48:28.140 --> 3:48:31.980]  We need to let the enemy's abuses continue to pile up while we continue to peacefully
[3:48:31.980 --> 3:48:36.380]  wake up the people until the government itself, many people in it, don't want to go along
[3:48:36.380 --> 3:48:37.380]  with it.
[3:48:37.380 --> 3:48:39.300]  And we're already starting to see that, G. Edward.
[3:48:39.300 --> 3:48:40.700]  I'm glad to hear that.
[3:48:40.700 --> 3:48:43.580]  I was not aware of that, but it's good news.
[3:48:43.580 --> 3:48:44.960]  Oh, yeah.
[3:48:44.960 --> 3:48:45.960]  Let's go ahead and take a call.
[3:48:45.960 --> 3:48:48.860]  Ronnie in Texas, you're on the air with G. Edward Griffin, author of Creature from
[3:48:48.860 --> 3:48:49.860]  Jack O'Liland.
[3:48:49.860 --> 3:48:50.860]  Go ahead.
[3:48:50.860 --> 3:48:52.780]  Thank you, gentlemen, about a Creature from Jack O'Liland.
[3:48:52.780 --> 3:48:59.460]  I've just given copies to the new mayor living well, and he's sharing it with Mike Martinez,
[3:48:59.460 --> 3:49:04.180]  and my sisters, other friends at the farmer's market and stuff, your copies of your book.
[3:49:04.180 --> 3:49:05.180]  So phenomenal.
[3:49:05.180 --> 3:49:06.180]  Well, thank you.
[3:49:06.180 --> 3:49:07.180]  Thank you.
[3:49:07.180 --> 3:49:08.900]  I'm trying to thank you.
[3:49:08.900 --> 3:49:11.100]  I'm so honored to hear your voice, and you can hear me.
[3:49:11.100 --> 3:49:15.580]  I've yet to get feedback, but I have an effect and band from the city council, and I'm sure
[3:49:15.580 --> 3:49:21.180]  you have experience with that, Mr. Jones, but OBGYN and Dr. Ron Paul Revolution of Love
[3:49:21.180 --> 3:49:25.740]  for Liberty and Our Sacred Constitution through the campaign for liberty.com just keeps on
[3:49:25.740 --> 3:49:26.740]  keeping on.
[3:49:26.740 --> 3:49:31.260]  I had to throw that in there, but about what you were saying earlier, elitism is at the
[3:49:31.260 --> 3:49:37.580]  core of all of this, bigotry and elitism, and so eugenics is fundamentally evil, and
[3:49:37.580 --> 3:49:43.500]  one of our main problems in defeating eugenics is the fact that there is some truth in what
[3:49:43.500 --> 3:49:46.020]  they say about human overpopulation.
[3:49:46.020 --> 3:49:51.140]  The population of humans on earth has more than doubled in my lifetime, and thus it is
[3:49:51.140 --> 3:49:53.180]  a real challenge for survival in the future.
[3:49:53.180 --> 3:49:58.620]  But I also agree with you, Mr. Jones, and Mr. Watson, your previous guest, that the killing
[3:49:58.620 --> 3:50:00.940]  people is not the answer.
[3:50:00.940 --> 3:50:02.460]  Obviously, there are no gays.
[3:50:02.460 --> 3:50:03.460]  Well, here's the deal.
[3:50:03.460 --> 3:50:08.860]  If you think we're overpopulated, which actually is disinfo at many levels, some of the technologies
[3:50:08.860 --> 3:50:14.700]  are dirty and bad and may have problems and need to be perfected or improved on.
[3:50:14.700 --> 3:50:17.800]  The issue is all this eugenics isn't about population.
[3:50:17.800 --> 3:50:19.700]  It's about control.
[3:50:19.700 --> 3:50:21.300]  It's about restricting.
[3:50:21.300 --> 3:50:22.380]  It's about feudalism.
[3:50:22.380 --> 3:50:23.380]  It's about serfdom.
[3:50:23.380 --> 3:50:29.420]  It's about a top-down, vertically integrated global government, and it's about controlling
[3:50:29.420 --> 3:50:31.540]  human destiny and dumbing the mass down.
[3:50:31.540 --> 3:50:33.740]  I appreciate your call.
[3:50:33.740 --> 3:50:37.580]  The eugenicists are actually trying to dumb people down to make them more manageable.
[3:50:37.580 --> 3:50:38.580]  G. Ebergriffen?
[3:50:38.580 --> 3:50:39.580]  Well, yeah.
[3:50:39.580 --> 3:50:40.580]  No question about it.
[3:50:40.580 --> 3:50:44.300]  And I think this issue of overpopulation needs to be focused on.
[3:50:44.300 --> 3:50:50.180]  The evidence is very strong that in advanced societies, the population now is decreasing.
[3:50:50.180 --> 3:50:51.180]  Decreasing.
[3:50:51.180 --> 3:50:52.900]  Only in parts of the world is it increasing.
[3:50:52.900 --> 3:50:53.900]  I believe that that's control.
[3:50:53.900 --> 3:50:57.260]  Well, the answer is you increase the technology, and they all know that.
[3:50:57.260 --> 3:50:59.420]  G. Ebergriffen, final segment straight ahead.
[3:50:59.420 --> 3:51:00.420]  Stay with us.
[3:51:00.420 --> 3:51:07.420]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[3:51:07.420 --> 3:51:13.420]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong,
[3:51:13.420 --> 3:51:15.420]  just as well-funded.
[3:51:15.420 --> 3:51:20.620]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest
[3:51:20.620 --> 3:51:21.940]  of the American people.
[3:51:21.940 --> 3:51:26.500]  Well, Obama's already fudging, fudged since day one in this election.
[3:51:26.500 --> 3:51:31.620]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing
[3:51:31.620 --> 3:51:38.140]  the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[3:51:38.140 --> 3:51:39.820]  It's not about left or right.
[3:51:39.820 --> 3:51:41.700]  It's about a one-world government.
[3:51:41.700 --> 3:51:48.620]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[3:53:00.980 --> 3:53:03.740]  This is Alex Jones with important news.
[3:53:03.740 --> 3:53:07.700]  I want to warn you about a deadly storm that's fast approaching, a storm that will affect
[3:53:07.700 --> 3:53:09.100]  you and everybody you know.
[3:53:09.100 --> 3:53:10.100]  Here's the story.
[3:53:10.100 --> 3:53:13.500]  The current administration is committed to nationalizing healthcare, giving 40 million
[3:53:13.500 --> 3:53:14.740]  new people free care.
[3:53:14.740 --> 3:53:15.980]  Now here's the bad news.
[3:53:15.980 --> 3:53:19.620]  The current system will almost be immediately overwhelmed by these new demands for free
[3:53:19.620 --> 3:53:21.380]  services and procedures.
[3:53:21.380 --> 3:53:23.260]  Medicare and Medicaid are already bankrupt.
[3:53:23.260 --> 3:53:27.780]  Many doctors are now leaving their practices frightened by the prospect of forced procedures.
[3:53:27.780 --> 3:53:31.900]  All this is creating a perfect storm which could create unimaginable shortages in the
[3:53:31.900 --> 3:53:32.900]  healthcare services.
[3:53:32.900 --> 3:53:35.500]  Folks, it's time to be prepared for the worst.
[3:53:35.500 --> 3:53:39.300]  Our friends at Solutions from Science have recently come up with an emergency preparedness
[3:53:39.300 --> 3:53:44.100]  course that reveals how you can make powerful herbal medicines in the privacy of your own
[3:53:44.100 --> 3:53:45.100]  home.
[3:53:45.100 --> 3:53:48.580]  This is one of the best herbal preparations in natural therapies and is flat out the best
[3:53:48.580 --> 3:53:49.580]  course of its kind.
[3:53:49.580 --> 3:53:53.900]  I recommend you visit this important new website at makeherbalmedicines.com.
[3:53:53.900 --> 3:54:22.180]  Or call toll-free 877-327-0365.
[3:54:22.180 --> 3:54:30.980]  Thanks for taking my call, Alex.
[3:54:30.980 --> 3:54:33.540]  Mr. Griffin, I want to say it's a pleasure to talk to you also.
[3:54:33.540 --> 3:54:38.700]  I use your CD, The Creature from Jekyll Island, as one of the intro packs I get people to
[3:54:38.700 --> 3:54:40.620]  introduce them to let them know what's going on.
[3:54:40.620 --> 3:54:45.100]  The main reason I call it today is I just wanted to let you know, Alex, about the soft-killed
[3:54:45.100 --> 3:54:46.100]  weapons.
[3:54:46.100 --> 3:54:49.980]  And I think one of the main things you stressed on it this morning is I went to the doctor,
[3:54:49.980 --> 3:54:52.940]  had a complete panel run, all blood tests.
[3:54:52.940 --> 3:54:53.940]  Everything was absolutely perfect.
[3:54:53.940 --> 3:54:56.660]  You know, I don't drink tap water, stuff like that.
[3:54:56.660 --> 3:55:01.300]  However, my testosterone level was 225 nanograms a deciliter.
[3:55:01.300 --> 3:55:04.260]  The average male is supposed to be 5 to 550.
[3:55:04.260 --> 3:55:07.580]  You don't start reaping the health benefits until 6 to 800.
[3:55:07.580 --> 3:55:12.620]  Now then, even if your blood panels, everything are good, if you live from middle age on with
[3:55:12.620 --> 3:55:17.540]  low testosterone, you are at greater, much greater risk for heart attack, stroke, and
[3:55:17.540 --> 3:55:18.540]  prostate cancer.
[3:55:18.540 --> 3:55:23.100]  Now then, do you think it's possible that they could be doing things already to lower
[3:55:23.100 --> 3:55:24.100]  the male testosterone?
[3:55:24.100 --> 3:55:27.140]  Of course, I went immediately on therapy to replace my level.
[3:55:27.140 --> 3:55:28.140]  No, no, no.
[3:55:28.140 --> 3:55:29.140]  Paul Watson.
[3:55:29.140 --> 3:55:30.140]  Paul Watson.
[3:55:30.140 --> 3:55:36.220]  I mean, the reason people are polite in Texas is, just 50, 60 years ago, if you were roots
[3:55:36.220 --> 3:55:37.880]  to somebody, they'd kill you.
[3:55:37.880 --> 3:55:39.540]  And now men just aren't as angry.
[3:55:39.540 --> 3:55:42.940]  They aren't as focused where it's a fake type of, you know, masculinist.
[3:55:42.940 --> 3:55:47.480]  But armed societies or polite societies, the artist's testosterone is lower.
[3:55:47.480 --> 3:55:49.900]  Our sperm counts are way lower.
[3:55:49.900 --> 3:55:54.340]  We are, Paul Watson has an article where they're putting chemicals in the water at
[3:55:54.340 --> 3:55:55.340]  prismplanet.com.
[3:55:55.340 --> 3:55:59.060]  Let me get a comment from Jebra Griffin on that.
[3:55:59.060 --> 3:56:02.100]  This engineering of the society, there's a lot of evidence to that.
[3:56:02.100 --> 3:56:03.100]  Your take on it.
[3:56:03.100 --> 3:56:06.820]  Well, my take on it is that like everybody else, it just makes a lot of sense and you
[3:56:06.820 --> 3:56:09.220]  can see the evidence of it as you go.
[3:56:09.220 --> 3:56:13.620]  I haven't really checked out the science myself, Alex, like you have or Watson, but it just
[3:56:13.620 --> 3:56:15.340]  makes a lot of sense.
[3:56:15.340 --> 3:56:20.700]  And again, once we understand the big picture and what these people are trying to do, then
[3:56:20.700 --> 3:56:27.580]  it's almost a perfect litmus paper test that you can use to come to a preliminary judgment
[3:56:27.580 --> 3:56:30.300]  anyway as to whether something is true or false.
[3:56:30.300 --> 3:56:35.580]  You do have to run it down and, you know, clarify it and check it out yourself.
[3:56:35.580 --> 3:56:39.780]  But you have a pretty good feeling for whether something is true or false when you understand
[3:56:39.780 --> 3:56:42.780]  how well it fits in with the overall plan.
[3:56:42.780 --> 3:56:43.780]  Absolutely.
[3:56:43.780 --> 3:56:44.780]  Absolutely.
[3:56:44.780 --> 3:56:45.780]  We have another call here.
[3:56:45.780 --> 3:56:50.980]  Let's talk to Chris and Marilyn, you're on the air with Jebra Griffin and infowars.com.
[3:56:50.980 --> 3:56:51.980]  Go ahead.
[3:56:51.980 --> 3:56:57.620]  Hey, mom, I had a question for you because I was talking to some fellows about this issue.
[3:56:57.620 --> 3:57:04.060]  But I did some reading on one of the websites, a lot like yours, where they had said that
[3:57:04.060 --> 3:57:09.460]  in the United States, down in the state of Alabama, they found a compound with trucks
[3:57:09.460 --> 3:57:14.100]  that had markings that looked a lot like they were Russian and they were supposed to be
[3:57:14.100 --> 3:57:19.780]  drilling them to do civil disobedience and, you know, explain this is an old urban legend
[3:57:19.780 --> 3:57:22.140]  that's been around since the mid nineties.
[3:57:22.140 --> 3:57:24.460]  This is how they debunk us.
[3:57:24.460 --> 3:57:28.300]  The United States government and others and some private companies bought tons of cheap
[3:57:28.300 --> 3:57:33.460]  eastern block surplus and I know people in Bastrop, you know, who collect them and they
[3:57:33.460 --> 3:57:36.180]  got a US one, a British one, a Russian one.
[3:57:36.180 --> 3:57:41.860]  And so people show that and say it's a Russian invasion, a bunch of 1970s rotting equipment.
[3:57:41.860 --> 3:57:46.940]  The real invasion is public deals signed to use Canadian, Mexican troops and others to
[3:57:46.940 --> 3:57:48.460]  quell civil disturbances.
[3:57:48.460 --> 3:57:50.940]  That's mainstream news, but nobody will ever focus on it.
[3:57:50.940 --> 3:57:58.660]  Toronto Star Associated Press, um, vigilant guardian, the national level exercise going
[3:57:58.660 --> 3:58:01.580]  on now is with troops from 14 governments.
[3:58:01.580 --> 3:58:06.260]  That's Homeland Security site, but nobody will get into the real admitted stuff.
[3:58:06.260 --> 3:58:08.820]  Instead they talk about what they heard or what they saw.
[3:58:08.820 --> 3:58:09.820]  I appreciate your call.
[3:58:09.820 --> 3:58:12.260]  I'm not saying you're a bad caller, I'm just correcting that.
[3:58:12.260 --> 3:58:13.940]  Do you ever grieve in your comments on that?
[3:58:13.940 --> 3:58:18.980]  Well, again, I'm stuck with saying what you said, Alec, that's certainly true.
[3:58:18.980 --> 3:58:23.140]  You get a lot of disinformation out there and unfortunately people will run with it
[3:58:23.140 --> 3:58:25.620]  because it's as the grains of truth.
[3:58:25.620 --> 3:58:27.820]  But no, you're absolutely right.
[3:58:27.820 --> 3:58:33.380]  The real threat is not from a bunch of old Russian trucks sitting in a lock for sale someplace.
[3:58:33.380 --> 3:58:38.220]  It's from the existing government and are in our treaties with other countries, Canada
[3:58:38.220 --> 3:58:40.220]  and Mexico in particular.
[3:58:40.220 --> 3:58:43.220]  Yeah, we're out of time.
[3:58:43.220 --> 3:58:46.220]  God bless.
[3:58:46.220 --> 3:58:51.700]  Be sure to visit GCN live.com today.
[3:58:51.700 --> 3:58:56.100]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator
[3:58:56.100 --> 3:58:57.100]  this summer.
[3:58:57.100 --> 3:59:00.980]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[3:59:00.980 --> 3:59:05.580]  Number two, our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company
[3:59:05.580 --> 3:59:06.820]  allows you to have.
[3:59:06.820 --> 3:59:08.820]  That's true.
[3:59:08.820 --> 3:59:11.980]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[3:59:11.980 --> 3:59:16.580]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded, especially
[3:59:16.580 --> 3:59:18.500]  with the high demand summer months ahead.
[3:59:18.500 --> 3:59:22.060]  Number four, the hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[3:59:22.060 --> 3:59:25.740]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather related outages.
[3:59:25.740 --> 3:59:30.260]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[3:59:30.260 --> 3:59:34.420]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science,
[3:59:34.420 --> 3:59:36.100]  a longtime sponsor of ours.
