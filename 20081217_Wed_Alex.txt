[05:07.620 --> 05:12.420]  need to be independent and food and water is the key you'll never have to stand in a bread line if
[05:12.420 --> 05:16.660]  you have your own bread you'll never have to go to the superdome and beg for femen to take care of
[05:16.660 --> 05:21.780]  your family in any emergency if you simply prepare our elected representatives wanted a good old boy
[05:21.780 --> 05:26.100]  bailout for a special interest so they ignored your screams not to do it they turned off the

[05:32.020 --> 05:37.140]  owns the america and european banks the exploding inflation that is now guaranteed will slash your
[05:37.140 --> 05:42.580]  life savings to nothing and blast the cost of necessities particularly food beyond many americans
[05:42.580 --> 05:48.100]  reach in pre-nazi germany super inflation the cost of a loaf of bread doubled every two days until
[05:48.100 --> 05:53.540]  it reached over four billion marks food prices are skyrocketing so fast there seems as if there may
[05:53.540 --> 05:58.660]  be no end in sight the private banks merging with our government are refusing to loan grocery stores
[05:58.660 --> 06:03.620]  enough money to restock their shelves the stores have less food but jack up prices to stay in business
[06:03.620 --> 06:08.740]  whatever happens in america we need to be prepared and be ready everything is zeroing in on food
[06:08.740 --> 06:12.900]  one third of americans have to choose between buying food and paying for other necessities
[06:12.900 --> 06:18.020]  my friends whatever it takes get prepared get self-sufficient get food for everybody out there

[07:25.300 --> 07:32.260]  minutes congressman ron paul is our guest until the bottom of the hour he said time and time again
[07:32.260 --> 07:37.700]  going back many years ago it's in my film matrix of evil when he gave a speech here in austin
[07:37.700 --> 07:42.980]  saying that when the federal reserve system collapses the economy when they go into hyperinflation
[07:44.260 --> 07:49.700]  they will either succeed in setting up their world government out of that crisis or we will
[07:49.700 --> 07:55.140]  succeed in laying the groundwork to educate the public about the fact that these supposed saviors
[07:55.140 --> 08:00.980]  are really the author of our financial doom of the doom of our prosperity we are now at that
[08:00.980 --> 08:06.900]  crossroads this is the critical time for all those that love liberty to educate their friends
[08:06.900 --> 08:12.500]  family neighbors the media about what we truly face that's why the federal reserve has dispatched
[08:12.500 --> 08:19.620]  their bank governors and thousands of their employees to public schools to corporate conferences
[08:19.620 --> 08:25.860]  to universities to brainwash the public that they're actually our saviors and so we are joined now
[08:25.860 --> 08:31.620]  to the bottom of the hour by congressman ron paul sir you've said this is a key time for us and on
[08:31.620 --> 08:36.340]  the house banking committee you're one of the lone voices really exposing what's happening
[08:37.380 --> 08:40.900]  what is this opportunity and how do we do away with the federal reserve
[08:41.860 --> 08:48.500]  i think everybody knows and we're in a crisis right now and uh they have now gotten to the
[08:48.500 --> 08:53.780]  point where they don't trust the government which is healthy uh a lot of people are begging and
[08:53.780 --> 08:59.060]  pleading and they're lining up you know the average guy outside of washington especially
[08:59.060 --> 09:04.260]  so many of the young people are realizing that it's all been a hoax and this is the time to
[09:04.260 --> 09:09.140]  really expose the hoax so uh although i've been trying to do that for 30 years to prevent the
[09:09.140 --> 09:14.500]  problems i think we have a real opportunity now to direct our attention to the real culprit and that
[09:14.500 --> 09:20.340]  is those who control the monetary system those who counterfeit our money and cause the financial
[09:20.340 --> 09:27.060]  bubbles and then the recessions and now they're working real hard on a depression so uh and it's
[09:27.060 --> 09:31.940]  easy to become despondent and i know a lot of people say why waste your time you can't do this
[09:31.940 --> 09:37.780]  and we should just escape and buy guns and all this kind of things but you know um i think we
[09:37.780 --> 09:44.020]  should see this as an opportunity because we have made inroads i think uh computers and websites
[09:44.020 --> 09:49.060]  and talk radio and the internet has given us a real opportunity to spread our message so
[09:49.700 --> 09:53.940]  hopefully i'm not being overly optimistic but i see it as a chance for us to get our message out
[09:54.900 --> 10:00.900]  congressman specifically eight weeks ago uh congressman sherman senator inhofe is now on
[10:00.900 --> 10:07.220]  record that enclosed joint committee meeting uh that secretary of the treasury polson and
[10:07.220 --> 10:14.100]  bernacky threatened them with physical martial law not house rules martial law but physical
[10:14.100 --> 10:19.220]  martial law and said there will be a depression next monday a total stock market collapse if you
[10:19.220 --> 10:24.020]  don't do this and they promised the public total transparency in the banker bill but i read it it
[10:24.020 --> 10:31.700]  was clearly a takeover uh now uh bloomberg reports as of a week and a half ago 8.5 trillion stolen
[10:31.700 --> 10:38.020]  the the bloomberg original lawsuit uh going back six weeks ago when two trillion had gone up missing
[10:38.020 --> 10:44.500]  the federal reserve is telling congress telling the people refusing for your request saying it's
[10:44.500 --> 10:51.380]  secret where the trillions went can you speak to a uh the fact that they literally terrorized the
[10:51.380 --> 10:58.820]  public uh and the congress to go along with the banker takeover bill and then now in the aftermath
[10:58.820 --> 11:04.180]  we see a financial dictatorship forming with the financial times of london last week calling for
[11:04.180 --> 11:08.740]  world government and saying the bankers uh shall be the rulers of the world government
[11:09.940 --> 11:15.220]  and and this is the whole whole whole point and that is uh governments that want to take over
[11:15.220 --> 11:22.020]  and undermine our liberties and have more power always use the uh fear factor they did this leading
[11:22.020 --> 11:27.380]  up you know to the war in iraq remember how they said you know if we don't go in there uh such and
[11:27.380 --> 11:31.700]  such is going to happen so they build up the fear and they do that on foreign policy now they're
[11:31.700 --> 11:40.740]  doing it on economic monetary and financial uh problems and yet the dilemma that we have is
[11:40.740 --> 11:46.340]  that we're scared to there should be a lot of fear uh it's knowing the truth that counts
[11:46.340 --> 11:54.340]  they use the weapon of fear uh dishonestly and but in many ways we have to talk about the dangers
[11:54.340 --> 12:00.020]  too and uh we should think i guess us telling people the truth and be more realistic rather than
[12:00.020 --> 12:04.580]  just beating the drums of fear so that people capitulate and do anything the government wants
[12:05.140 --> 12:10.500]  but uh there it is very dangerous the big question is is do they have any possible answer to this
[12:10.500 --> 12:15.540]  they scare everybody here they've committed eight and a half trillion dollars uh they're stealing
[12:15.540 --> 12:21.060]  from the people they're destroying the dollar dollar went down seven percent last week and uh
[12:21.060 --> 12:27.060]  they're they're just making problems so much worse and the ultimate threat to us is not only
[12:27.060 --> 12:31.060]  the loss of wealth and destruction of dollar the ultimate threat is the loss of our liberties how
[12:31.060 --> 12:36.260]  about we said that if we lost everything tomorrow if we had our liberty it got rid of the irs and
[12:36.260 --> 12:41.460]  had found money i think we could all go back to work and realizing that everything we earn we can
[12:41.460 --> 12:47.620]  keep i mean we've we've become so wealthy so quick we could overcome this mess but uh unfortunately
[12:47.620 --> 12:54.020]  is an uphill struggle but uh we have to fight it congressman specifically i mean you are the
[12:54.020 --> 13:02.500]  worldwide leader uh or or the uh the uh standard bearer for exposing the international banking
[13:02.500 --> 13:07.940]  cartel specifically is this economic terrorism to say we're going to have a depression if you
[13:07.940 --> 13:13.700]  don't give us tens of trillions of dollars uh and then and then basically uh take on these
[13:13.700 --> 13:20.660]  omnipotent powers uh as congressman kucinich in committee a few weeks ago uh called it i mean
[13:20.660 --> 13:27.940]  is this not a hardcore criminality don't we need to point out that these are criminals just like uh
[13:27.940 --> 13:33.540]  made off the former head of the nasdaq uh running his own ponzi scheme with the brokerage firms
[13:33.540 --> 13:39.940]  it's now coming out that it's system-wide i mean don't we need to call uh for grand juries uh to
[13:39.940 --> 13:44.100]  do investigations and indict some of these people because if we don't do that they're still going
[13:44.100 --> 13:50.900]  to continue to pose as our saviors yeah and we should uh but some are more culpable than others
[13:50.900 --> 13:57.300]  uh because some know exactly what they're doing but there's so many people that still exist
[13:57.300 --> 14:02.740]  that do you talk in just like very very good people were talked into voting to give the president
[14:02.740 --> 14:08.260]  power to go to war uh and they were just too naive and went along with it a lot of people
[14:08.260 --> 14:12.740]  are doing that now they they they didn't want to vote for the bill out and they heard that is
[14:12.740 --> 14:17.460]  threat that oh my god i don't want to be on record of doing this so they are they are
[14:17.460 --> 14:24.260]  terrorized by this but you know if we go after it made off which we should uh we don't need
[14:24.260 --> 14:29.300]  we don't need you know more regulatory agency is what we need is just the enforcement of fraud
[14:29.300 --> 14:34.500]  law at the point of eye and go after these guys but you know in a way this is small potatoes
[14:34.500 --> 14:38.900]  he's small potatoes compared to the fraud of the federal reserve what about the fraud
[14:38.900 --> 14:44.100]  what about the pondy scheme called social security who you can indict for social security let me
[14:44.100 --> 14:49.860]  ask you this question now congress is talking about taking over even private IRAs and in hearings
[14:49.860 --> 14:55.220]  and then uh sending the money back to the people as a government check but taxing it i mean they're
[14:55.220 --> 15:01.620]  clearly getting ready to raid the pension funds and social security uh how do we stop that well
[15:01.620 --> 15:06.900]  we we have to you know be aware of it and as it approached we have to get the people organized
[15:06.900 --> 15:12.740]  but the question will be are there more people that want the money or more people holding the IRA
[15:12.740 --> 15:19.620]  and 401k said and unfortunately there's far more people on the doll and then they might just not
[15:19.620 --> 15:23.860]  want to fight it and you know with the crowd moving in as bad as the last administration
[15:23.860 --> 15:29.940]  was when it comes to economic matters and tax matters i mean we have a even a tougher uh
[15:29.940 --> 15:36.180]  road to hoe uh you know from here on out so um yeah that one will be hard to fight but i think
[15:36.180 --> 15:41.540]  what has happened is that before they do that i think the crisis will build to such a point in
[15:41.540 --> 15:46.260]  the dollar class will come because i think it would take them a year or so to do that and then
[15:46.260 --> 15:52.420]  then it would just add more fuel power but uh right now things are moving rather rapidly
[15:52.420 --> 15:59.140]  and uh who knows what will come even in the next three congressmen did we lose your phone
[16:02.100 --> 16:06.740]  okay he'll be calling back in he was going to be at his home today but then he had to
[16:06.740 --> 16:14.020]  go somewhere so i believe we lost the congressman's cell number he's probably taking his wife the
[16:14.020 --> 16:21.620]  doctor or something um we will uh get the congressman back on with us uh right now guys go ahead and
[16:21.620 --> 16:31.540]  call jesse benton hey guys go ahead and call jesse benton and uh thank you and uh make sure
[16:31.540 --> 16:36.660]  that the congressman's able to call back in he'll do that because i way i had the next big question
[16:36.660 --> 16:47.940]  for him dealing with the fact that they engage in economic terrorism they came out and the president
[16:47.940 --> 16:53.540]  and the democrats and barack obama so bush and obama said that if you don't pass this we're
[16:53.540 --> 16:57.140]  going to have a depression and that was the first time they uttered those words and that's when the
[16:57.140 --> 17:03.780]  market plunged if you remember uh a thousand points uh in one afternoon and that was economic
[17:03.780 --> 17:09.540]  terrorism plain and simple congressman we lost you there on your cell phone and john to catch that
[17:09.540 --> 17:14.260]  time back up i'm going to skip this network break this is a network break so for stations out there
[17:14.260 --> 17:17.620]  we're skipping this break you'll get your break at the bottom of the hour congressman good to have
[17:17.620 --> 17:22.740]  you back specifically serve on record from you on the banking committee was it not economic
[17:22.740 --> 17:27.940]  terrorism to have the president and the president elect at the time barack obama and others saying
[17:27.940 --> 17:32.340]  before he was even elected if you don't pass this we're going to have a depression that then
[17:32.340 --> 17:37.620]  introduced this idea to people and accelerated uh the markets dropping a thousand points the
[17:37.620 --> 17:44.740]  day they said that was that not economic terrorism obviously it was and uh they should be held
[17:44.740 --> 17:50.100]  responsible for this but like i mentioned they do that all the time that that's their technique
[17:50.100 --> 17:55.380]  is always to build the tremendous fear up in the hearts of the people what it has to do with foreign
[17:55.380 --> 18:00.100]  policy and the reason we have to go to war now on economic matters terrorize the people and say
[18:00.100 --> 18:04.180]  that we are your saviors and we're the only ones that can take care of you the only thing that can
[18:04.180 --> 18:10.900]  counteract this is a uh different philosophy a convincing argument at free markets and found
[18:10.900 --> 18:15.860]  money in no federal reserve and limited taxes the things that made america great we have to get
[18:15.860 --> 18:21.220]  more people and endorse our views and uh i think the opportunity is coming because uh the system
[18:21.220 --> 18:27.140]  that they're trying to patch together right now will not work well specifically they promised
[18:27.140 --> 18:33.380]  this would fix things but it only gets worse the more the bailouts continue and and and now
[18:33.380 --> 18:36.660]  they're talking about quote bailing out the auto industry but that's not even what it is they're
[18:36.660 --> 18:44.260]  going to nationalize it and have obama's cabinet cronies uh in there controlling that as a political
[18:44.260 --> 18:50.020]  tool and and literally taking over the unions i mean how dangerous is that sir well it's
[18:50.020 --> 18:54.740]  tremendously dangerous because uh although we've been creeping in that direction now this is an
[18:54.740 --> 19:00.340]  endorsement of nationalization uh if they keep token ownership with the corporations which they
[19:00.340 --> 19:05.860]  probably will then it's called fascism and it's building up on this uh so-called partnership
[19:05.860 --> 19:09.300]  this morning on one of the business station they were bragging about how great Bernanke was and
[19:09.300 --> 19:14.900]  he should be called the man of the year because he understands business and he's a good businessman
[19:14.900 --> 19:19.700]  and he knows how to invest this money and i thought that is the most dangerous statement in the
[19:19.700 --> 19:25.380]  world it's a confession that now a federal reserve and government and treasury they're
[19:25.380 --> 19:30.900]  bosom buddies of uh of corporations and that to me is about as close to fascism as you can get
[19:30.900 --> 19:37.700]  it is as close to fascism as you can get uh classically and and and i think the public starting
[19:37.700 --> 19:45.300]  to uh recognize this uh we have uh the prime minister uh of canada right now steven harper
[19:45.300 --> 19:50.900]  saying that it looks like we're going into a depression uh we have one of the uh well v chief
[19:50.900 --> 19:56.500]  of the imf saying we're probably going to have riots worldwide uh if they quote don't get things
[19:56.500 --> 20:01.460]  going but if you look at the imf world bank documents that got leaked to the bbc in late 2001
[20:01.460 --> 20:07.140]  they state that they cut off liquidity by design to implode markets so that they can then come in
[20:07.140 --> 20:14.100]  and buy things up for pennies on the dollar uh can you speak to that well not clearly because i
[20:14.100 --> 20:21.620]  don't know if that's true i suspect that it might be but i also think that this is such a big bubble
[20:21.620 --> 20:25.620]  that even those with a lot of money you know get a little bit nervous about what's happening
[20:25.620 --> 20:34.420]  but one thing for sure is they're they're pretty uh pretty capable of shifting so if it goes sour
[20:34.420 --> 20:39.060]  worse than they expect because i don't think they have perfect control but they're always available
[20:39.060 --> 20:42.500]  and they do have cash they're not arguing there's a little bit of cash and just think of all this
[20:42.500 --> 20:47.220]  new credit so there's a lot of money sitting there ready to be bought up and it won't be the average
[20:47.220 --> 20:51.700]  guy on the street that you know lost everything in the stock market it's going to be these people
[20:51.700 --> 20:56.980]  who've got a little sooner they've got new credit from the fed Goldman Sachs will be around for a
[20:56.980 --> 21:02.180]  while and the money market accounts have trillions of dollars so somebody is going to buy this up
[21:02.180 --> 21:07.540]  but it's not going to be a return to the market economy at the rate we're going well i mean the
[21:07.540 --> 21:11.940]  basic fundamental and i'd like to get your your take on this congressman we're talking again
[21:11.940 --> 21:18.980]  talking to congressman ron paul from uh texas dealing with this i mean clearly the authors
[21:18.980 --> 21:23.700]  of the economic collapse we're witnessing in the worldwide depression that this whole crisis
[21:23.700 --> 21:29.940]  is spiraling into are now posing and positioning themselves as the saviors and and the mainstream
[21:29.940 --> 21:36.820]  media fox news cnn msnbc every time i'm watching a banking committee uh the house banking senate
[21:36.820 --> 21:40.980]  banking every time i'm watching one of the subcommittees they will show kashkari they will
[21:40.980 --> 21:46.980]  show paulson they will show other operatives of the system they will show their propaganda but
[21:46.980 --> 21:52.260]  as soon as it cuts to the chairman or to yourself or to any other member of the committees they cut
[21:52.260 --> 21:58.340]  away so clearly the the the big banking cartels are controlling and owning much of the media so so
[21:58.340 --> 22:02.500]  how do we get around that uh when they won't let the public understand what's really happening
[22:03.220 --> 22:06.740]  well you have to recognize it and you have to do your best to get around it
[22:06.740 --> 22:12.820]  although i complain just as you are complaining uh i'm still getting a lot more interviews now
[22:12.820 --> 22:17.860]  than i did a year ago on this issue so it's not i'm not completely blocked out but there's a lot
[22:17.860 --> 22:24.740]  of what you say that that goes on but then we have to go around them if nothing else what i fear is
[22:24.740 --> 22:29.620]  them closing down the internet that to me would be the big problem you know if they take that away
[22:29.620 --> 22:33.700]  from us so we've been able to reach millions of people through the internet you reach a lot of
[22:33.700 --> 22:40.100]  people on radio so they start cracking down on radios and internet and shortwave and all these
[22:40.100 --> 22:44.500]  things then that's when we're really in big trouble well as you know they've openly in congress
[22:44.500 --> 22:49.540]  talked about bringing back the fairness doctrine this internet to doctor i'm sure you know but for
[22:49.540 --> 22:56.420]  the audience they are shifting uh basically all the new upgrades internet to where private
[22:56.420 --> 23:00.980]  corporations own it and control it and then and they admit they're not going to allow free speech
[23:00.980 --> 23:04.980]  they're only going to give people a few thousand websites and not the hundreds of millions that
[23:04.980 --> 23:09.060]  are currently available so what they're doing is hijacking the web uh we're going back to the full
[23:09.060 --> 23:18.340]  audience here we go okay congressman ron paul and we've only got about five minutes left with you
[23:18.340 --> 23:25.380]  right now sir specifically there is an army war college report out and you know about uh north
[23:25.380 --> 23:30.820]  com announcing 20 000 combat trips for the streets of america uh they're openly stating it is for
[23:30.820 --> 23:36.820]  civil unrest and rioting uh the new reports called the nose and unknowns unconventional strategic
[23:36.820 --> 23:41.940]  shock and defense strategy development the army openly says in here on the army war college that
[23:41.940 --> 23:48.500]  they are preparing to engage the american people uh posse commentatus has not been fully uh removed
[23:48.500 --> 23:55.460]  i mean we're now seeing open martial law uh being discussed and being uh debated as if it is the
[23:55.460 --> 24:01.620]  solution uh to the financial crisis and under uh the new defense department directive put out the
[24:01.620 --> 24:07.860]  24th by gates sir uh they're saying that governors will be under the control of the president uh and
[24:07.860 --> 24:14.180]  will serve at his pleasure can you speak to that well i i think what you're doing is just pointing
[24:14.180 --> 24:19.940]  out the danger using the fear factor for our foreign policy and our financial problems and now
[24:19.940 --> 24:25.620]  they do it for your physical safety which to me is just a continuation of the 9 11 post 9 11
[24:25.620 --> 24:29.780]  attitude because that was when they started passing getting passed all the legislation
[24:29.780 --> 24:34.660]  that they had proposed for so many years now they're saying well we're going to have chaos in
[24:34.660 --> 24:38.900]  the streets the terrorists aren't going to be people coming from from outside the terrorists
[24:38.900 --> 24:43.300]  are going to be our own people there's going to be chaos here in the streets as a consequence of
[24:43.300 --> 24:49.220]  the financial crisis so therefore we have to militarize our community um and once again it's
[24:49.220 --> 24:57.300]  that uh attitude that government is our savior and they can't save us i mean uh all the sec and
[24:57.300 --> 25:03.460]  all the regulations can't protect us against fraud and uh all the policemen in the world
[25:03.460 --> 25:08.660]  can't protect us in our homes congressman continuing continuing in the time we have left
[25:09.220 --> 25:15.300]  specifically they are saying they're preparing to engage the american people is this unconstitutional
[25:15.300 --> 25:22.500]  is this treason well it's obviously not constitutional and uh depending on how it comes
[25:22.500 --> 25:29.060]  about it could very well be treasonous but uh on how the confrontation comes of course they would
[25:29.060 --> 25:34.580]  never say that they're confronting they might use those terms but they might say we're confronting
[25:34.580 --> 25:38.980]  violence and we're going there to save you we don't want your city's burnt out so therefore
[25:38.980 --> 25:43.540]  we're going to put our troops in there to prevent these problems so uh you know just think of all
[25:43.540 --> 25:47.860]  the harm that they've done over these last especially last hundred years how often do they
[25:47.860 --> 25:53.060]  really get hauled into the court and what about the illegality of the whole monetary system nothing
[25:53.060 --> 25:58.900]  really happens so it it depends on what the people understand and believe in that really
[25:58.900 --> 26:05.300]  how though we cannot depend on the congress or our courts to save us well sir going back uh
[26:06.340 --> 26:09.700]  over the last 20 years as you know they've been covertly getting rid of posse common
[26:09.700 --> 26:14.340]  taught us merging the military and police and now they're acting like they just set this up last week
[26:14.340 --> 26:20.100]  this is large this is part of a larger strategic plan yeah and matter of fact they did pass a
[26:20.100 --> 26:24.500]  couple years ago i think was in 96 in the supplemental uh serious erosion of posse
[26:24.500 --> 26:30.740]  common taught us and it was finally exposed and and then it was in a way reversed uh but that's
[26:30.740 --> 26:35.860]  just tokenism i mean if they feel like doing something wrong they just go ahead and do it
[26:35.860 --> 26:41.300]  so uh the fact that they reversed that in a token way it shouldn't reassure us uh because when push
[26:41.300 --> 26:45.060]  comes to shove they're gonna ignore it but they would change the law when they get the opportunity
[26:45.060 --> 26:49.300]  and this is new administration i'm sure it would be quite capable of doing it even without the
[26:49.300 --> 26:56.340]  congress you know about executive orders and pd51 absolutely sir in closing two final questions in
[26:56.340 --> 27:04.020]  the two minutes we have left with you specifically um did you see the article in financial times of
[27:04.020 --> 27:08.100]  london admitting that they've covertly set up world government the headline and now for world
[27:08.100 --> 27:12.980]  government admitting i mean do they need to apologize all the people that called us kooks
[27:12.980 --> 27:18.180]  because we were reading the internal white papers well no they're not going they're not going to
[27:18.180 --> 27:23.860]  apologize i didn't happen to see that article but you know when brnecke was before the committee
[27:23.860 --> 27:27.780]  the last time i wanted to know what kind of international plans he had you know for the
[27:27.780 --> 27:33.140]  currency and the world central bank of course he has no obligation to answer any of those questions
[27:33.140 --> 27:38.100]  uh he has a moral obligation but under the law he doesn't under the constitution he should
[27:38.740 --> 27:43.860]  so uh yeah i think those plans are being laid uh people say well it's not going to happen
[27:43.860 --> 27:47.940]  but you know they used to say that the european union wouldn't it wouldn't ever happen so
[27:47.940 --> 27:52.100]  i think we should take this stuff seriously and uh this morning there was a pretty strong
[27:52.100 --> 27:57.860]  announcement by the imf that their vehicle is going to be these uh sdrs the special drawing
[27:57.860 --> 28:03.940]  rights this is what they used to call paper gold will be the world wide reserve currency they tried
[28:03.940 --> 28:08.580]  to do it didn't work but now they see another opening so it's world it's world government
[28:08.580 --> 28:13.780]  oven by the bank or serve as a rallying cry we can defeat this world government can't we what are
[28:13.780 --> 28:21.140]  the people need to do well the truth is on our side and also the economic policies on our side
[28:21.140 --> 28:25.140]  what was the big most important thing is information to the people so they know what we're doing
[28:25.140 --> 28:30.660]  though watching their best interest not to have people in congress keep voting for hell out and
[28:31.220 --> 28:35.060]  this pretends that we're going to take care of everybody so knowledge is the only answer to
[28:35.060 --> 28:39.540]  the problems that we have today and as you said earlier uh they are coming after the internet
[28:40.740 --> 28:46.100]  yep that's what uh that is my greatest fear uh because we'll never be able to control the three
[28:46.100 --> 28:51.380]  majors but right now we can get around that the more knowledge is out there the more we can make
[28:51.380 --> 28:55.940]  inroads to the average person that does appear congressman for everybody's mind i want you
[28:55.940 --> 29:01.700]  to have a great christmas let me say bye to you during the break we're on the march the empires on

[29:16.020 --> 29:21.940]  are overly acidic due to stress acidic diet and lack of exercise ph balance is the foundation of
[29:21.940 --> 29:26.660]  energy abundance and perfect health as well as prevention of disease people who alkalis the
[29:26.660 --> 29:32.180]  water they drink experience normalized blood sugar mental clarity and loss of weight it was intended
[29:32.180 --> 29:37.620]  for human beings to drink alkaline water but due to modern way of life most people are overly acidic
[29:37.620 --> 29:42.820]  the fact is that disease simply cannot exist in an alkaline environment fat accumulates if a person
[29:42.820 --> 29:48.180]  consumes too much acid on a regular basis and doesn't neutralize it do your part alkalize and
[29:48.180 --> 29:53.940]  supercharge your body now alcovision plasma ph drops contain a special mineral salt concentrate

[33:55.380 --> 34:01.700]  Henry Kissinger on record said they would create a worldwide economic collapse to usher in world
[34:01.700 --> 34:08.260]  government but first they had to militarize the police and condition the public to accept secret
[34:08.260 --> 34:17.620]  arrest and martial law we are now entering into the land of world government run by psychopathic
[34:17.620 --> 34:23.620]  control freak tyrants you can see the enemy standards all around us the all-seeing eye
[34:23.620 --> 34:33.300]  as their dark hordes march against us if we rally the people stand up and resist if we speak out

[34:40.500 --> 34:50.660]  if god be with us who can stand against us i ask you now make the choice decide whether you're

[35:12.340 --> 35:17.380]  to him during the break when we first got him on about coming on for a full hour sometime early next
[35:17.380 --> 35:24.580]  year to go over his plan to defeat the federal reserve he's introduced a bill of the last decade
[35:24.580 --> 35:31.860]  plus uh in congress and he's gotten close to 70 cosponsors on that to remove the private
[35:31.860 --> 35:36.980]  federal reserve now either we remove this group that has engineered the collapse we're seeing or
[35:36.980 --> 35:41.700]  they are going to bring us into the next level of their tyranny this doesn't sit there stagnant
[35:41.700 --> 35:47.460]  at one point either gets worse or we push back and things get better they will give you no quarter
[35:48.260 --> 35:51.460]  and i want to talk to the military and police don't you want to be with the republic don't

[36:00.180 --> 36:05.620]  evidence but in your gut you know this al-qaeda business is fake and staged you know real crises
[36:05.620 --> 36:12.900]  like the texas mexico arizona nevada border with mexico collapsing and thousands dead every
[36:14.100 --> 36:20.980]  year is the serious issue you know the issue of taxation and regulation and control and face scanning
[36:20.980 --> 36:26.340]  cameras and cameras in school bathrooms and cameras inside the stalls at rest stops and
[36:26.340 --> 36:33.220]  all the surveillance going in you know it's evil you know i mean even the uniforms the black scheme
[36:33.220 --> 36:40.580]  mask the armored vehicles the microwave guns the new heroes on television torture children i mean
[36:40.580 --> 36:46.980]  they're twisting us they're they're teaching us that evil is good you know in your heart 50 million
[36:46.980 --> 36:53.860]  abortions since 1974 is evil you know in your heart killing millions of iraqis and 18 years of
[36:53.860 --> 37:00.020]  siege against that nation is evil and you know it's going to blow back against you and it is now
[37:00.020 --> 37:05.540]  the elite will kill and enslave in iraq and afghanistan and syria and launch sneak attacks against
[37:05.540 --> 37:11.620]  russia the elite will stage all of these horrible events and you think that you are immune from
[37:11.620 --> 37:16.500]  that you think you're separate from that you think they won't do similar things like that here
[37:16.500 --> 37:23.060]  it is their ruthless bloodthirsty cunning instinct to do this that's why they're in control that's
[37:23.060 --> 37:28.340]  why they are in power they believe in survival of the fittest social darwinism they believe it's
[37:28.340 --> 37:34.180]  their right to rule over us and they have destroyed our morals so that we're more easily controlled
[37:34.180 --> 37:39.780]  so that we don't stick together so that we're all isolated we have to come together under a culture
[37:39.780 --> 37:46.420]  of liberty and freedom against the new world order now you just heard congressman ron paul telling you
[37:46.420 --> 37:51.300]  this is a new world order takeover an engineered collapse they are bringing us into world government
[37:51.300 --> 37:56.420]  we must stop it now it is in hundreds of newspapers it is openly being announced
[37:56.420 --> 38:01.940]  that the military is going to be used against the american people for combat against the american
[38:01.940 --> 38:08.260]  people the story is up on prisonplanet.com army strategic shock report says troops maybe needed
[38:08.260 --> 38:15.220]  to quell us civil unrest known unknowns unconventional strategic shock in defense strategy development
[38:15.220 --> 38:22.660]  states that it is a battle plan to make war against the american people and they set this up
[38:22.660 --> 38:29.140]  decades ago this did not just materialize how long did i warn you how long did i specifically tell
[38:29.140 --> 38:33.620]  you how long did we lay out that they would first stage terror attacks then get a police
[38:33.620 --> 38:38.820]  state in place then have an economic collapse knowing starving people and jobless people would
[38:38.820 --> 38:43.780]  riot then that gives them the pretext to come in with total control and that's how they would sell
[38:43.780 --> 38:49.860]  it and now in their own army reports and their official directives they are saying their job
[38:49.860 --> 38:56.740]  is to suppress the american people and to make sure that the criminals like made off
[38:56.740 --> 39:01.460]  who is stolen first they said 10 billion then 50 billion now some reports are saying the exposure
[39:01.460 --> 39:08.900]  could be above a hundred billion dollars ripping off police fire department teacher funds there's a
[39:08.900 --> 39:18.020]  huge list of it it's mainly pension funds of states counties and cities upwards of 100 and
[39:18.020 --> 39:22.420]  every day goes up by tens of billions and he got a he got arrested a few days ago this broke last
[39:22.420 --> 39:25.940]  week they said it was a few hundred million then it was a billion then it was 10 billion now it's
[39:25.940 --> 39:30.980]  50 billion now they're saying it could be over a hundred billion by the time they're done i don't
[39:30.980 --> 39:35.620]  know 300 400 500 billion i mean who knows you know they said it would be a 700 billion dollar
[39:35.620 --> 39:41.060]  banker takeover bailout now it's 8.5 trillion and that was two weeks ago two wednesdays ago
[39:41.060 --> 39:49.060]  so bloomberg reported the congress reported the san francisco chronicle reported that it was 8.5
[39:49.060 --> 39:55.460]  trillion we don't know now it was 1 trillion 300 billion on average a week being stolen in the
[39:55.460 --> 40:02.580]  first six and a half weeks we do not know what it is now we have no idea they're saying they're
[40:02.580 --> 40:07.140]  not even going to release basic numbers lawsuits have been filed the congress has demanded to see
[40:07.140 --> 40:11.780]  it and they've been told you don't get to see anything and alan greenspan the former chairman
[40:11.780 --> 40:18.340]  of the private fed goes on lair news hour and says we are above the law no one can indict us
[40:18.340 --> 40:24.180]  no one can touch us now made-offs in trouble because he ripped off a lot of powerful elites in the
[40:24.180 --> 40:31.060]  united states cnbc reports that around half of the hundred billion dollars was from prominent
[40:31.060 --> 40:37.300]  jewish groups and holocaust charities and other things steven spielberg and others and they're
[40:37.300 --> 40:44.420]  saying that maybe those groups might get some of the money back now this is the former head of the
[40:44.420 --> 40:52.100]  nasdaq the second biggest stock exchange in the world this is not some fly-by-night criminal and it
[40:52.100 --> 40:57.300]  come out in the news today in the associated press cnbc i have the articles right here in front of
[40:57.300 --> 41:02.180]  me they're up on info wars dot com prison planet dot com where they're going oh my god this was
[41:02.180 --> 41:06.740]  completely sanctioned by the banks and brokerage firms of course it was this is what they do
[41:07.460 --> 41:14.180]  and then a bunch of made-offs people and charities and cities said okay we want to go ahead and cash
[41:14.180 --> 41:19.860]  out of some of our money not even all of their investments in and he said oh it's not there
[41:19.860 --> 41:24.100]  and then the investigation began but it turns out that the securities and exchange commission
[41:24.100 --> 41:28.020]  a year ago people weren't getting their money from made-off and people went to the
[41:28.580 --> 41:36.500]  mr cox at the sec and he said you know what we're not going to investigate them but mark cuban and
[41:36.500 --> 41:44.180]  i couldn't talk about this at the time in early 2007 but we were in discussions with mark cuban
[41:45.220 --> 41:54.020]  charlie sheen and his manager i mean i mean there i was literally at meetings at charlie
[41:54.020 --> 41:59.780]  sheen's house uh you know discussing all this but now it's public and you know there i am with
[41:59.780 --> 42:09.460]  you know the biggest lawyer in um hollywood and there we all are discussing this and it was
[42:10.260 --> 42:17.060]  the fact that cuban was being threatened one of the other producers coming in was being threatened
[42:17.060 --> 42:22.900]  over all of this over the fact that mark cuban was was about to put out loose change final cut
[42:22.900 --> 42:28.420]  in movie theaters and on dvd nationwide worldwide and remember remember how
[42:32.420 --> 42:36.740]  i'm kind of hesitating here because i can talk about this now but but i'm i'm trying to be
[42:36.740 --> 42:40.580]  careful about what i say or what i get into because it's so incredible i mean this is the
[42:40.580 --> 42:46.500]  type of stuff that i gotta be very careful about what i say because it's been in the new york times
[42:46.500 --> 42:59.940]  now some of the basics but one of the other producers brother it was a air force general
[43:01.460 --> 43:06.580]  and when this wasn't even on the news yet he calls up to the producer and says if you care about
[43:06.580 --> 43:12.980]  your kids you better not do that project showing that the phone lines were clearly tapped then
[43:12.980 --> 43:20.580]  all riley and others cnn host others go on tv not just fox and say do not make this film charlie
[43:20.580 --> 43:27.060]  sheen do not voice this do not be involved with this or you will pay and basically mafia asked
[43:27.060 --> 43:34.340]  threatened him on the news that parts public and then mark cuban said that he had been threatened
[43:34.340 --> 43:39.220]  and that uh he wanted to put out controversial films but that this was just a little too much and
[43:39.220 --> 43:47.700]  then he was pulling out and i just you know went on air ignored the whole thing people
[43:47.700 --> 43:50.740]  laughed in our own movement because they don't really care about some of them about fighting
[43:50.740 --> 43:55.620]  for liberty and freedom uh it was like oh good you know alex has failed to get that out in in
[43:55.620 --> 44:03.540]  theaters ha ha ha uh which was truly disgusting and very very saddening to me and now it's come
[44:03.540 --> 44:08.180]  out in the new york times that the securities and exchange commission sent an email and i
[44:08.180 --> 44:14.900]  had to know made phone calls separate individuals to mark cuban saying if you don't want a magnifying
[44:14.900 --> 44:20.500]  glass uh looking at everything you're doing and if and if you don't want to you know basically
[44:20.500 --> 44:26.180]  getting a lot of trouble and one of the emails is now public uh you better not be involved in this
[44:26.180 --> 44:30.820]  so imagine having national tv threaten you the securities and exchange commission openly violating
[44:30.820 --> 44:39.540]  the first amendment terrorizing people in hollywood uh not to uh put this film out and now it's come
[44:39.540 --> 44:44.980]  out in the new york times the email that mark cuban was threatened now now mark cuban is worth
[44:44.980 --> 44:51.300]  billions of dollars with three or four billion dollars owns a major basketball team uh the mavericks
[44:51.300 --> 44:58.660]  in dallas puts out you know more than 20 films and documentaries a year this was just one project
[44:58.660 --> 45:04.980]  he was involved in and that's just flat out tyranny and they claim that oh he sold some stock and
[45:04.980 --> 45:10.740]  then you know made 800 000 or something because he knew it was going to be going down and he's
[45:10.740 --> 45:14.660]  fighting it he's he's going to court he's battling him because if you look at the evidence he didn't
[45:14.660 --> 45:20.580]  do anything wrong now now now meanwhile made off is allowed to steal close to right now they're
[45:20.580 --> 45:25.380]  saying the shirt will grow a hundred billion dollars he's allowed to rip off police fire
[45:25.380 --> 45:31.220]  department teacher funds do whatever he wants they go to the sec a year ago right around the
[45:31.220 --> 45:36.740]  same time this was all happening and they go to him and and people complain and the sec says
[45:36.740 --> 45:41.940]  we're not going to investigate but then for political purposes they threatened him a year ago
[45:41.940 --> 45:48.100]  started an investigation of him over a year ago and have now indicted him for this and it's all
[45:48.100 --> 45:53.700]  because of being involved with charlie sheen and myself and uh dylan avery and jason bermas and others
[45:53.700 --> 45:59.620]  but it was myself that got charlie in touch with the loose change guys we had him out to california
[45:59.620 --> 46:03.860]  a couple times uh that got off you know that whole ball rolling and so people talk about
[46:03.860 --> 46:08.180]  oh you know alex if you were for real you'd be under more heat you'd have more things happening
[46:08.180 --> 46:12.980]  to you uh folks number one it's the evidence it's the information it's the knowledge that we're putting
[46:12.980 --> 46:19.380]  out that matters that's a b i'm not going to advertise the hell i've gone through to be at
[46:19.380 --> 46:23.940]  the tip of the spear but we do need your support i mean i've been physically attacked i've been
[46:23.940 --> 46:29.940]  threatened i've been you know audited i have constant death threats people calling my wife up
[46:29.940 --> 46:36.500]  other women saying alex got me pregnant or alex gave me a disease trying to freak her out uh
[46:36.500 --> 46:43.300]  you know just just feds calling and doing this oh hello is alex there this is jenny oh well

[46:59.860 --> 47:05.220]  living but we ignore it and continue on with the fight but you want to see the type of stuff we're
[47:05.220 --> 47:12.180]  under producers having their children threatened before this was ever public months later o'reilly
[47:12.180 --> 47:16.500]  on the news and others attacking us saying we better watch it we're going to get it you better
[47:16.500 --> 47:23.620]  not do this if you know what's good for you mafias threats on the air like lakosa nostra the scc
[47:23.620 --> 47:29.380]  saying you better not do this cuban and phone calls and emails or you are going to jail pal
[47:29.940 --> 47:36.340]  to make him not make that film and then when the film doesn't get put out in theaters but we fight
[47:36.340 --> 47:42.020]  and do release it on dvd people all over the supposed patriot movement who are really feds
[47:42.020 --> 47:47.140]  cheer and get up and say oh they're liars they never talked to mark cuban they're liars charlie
[47:47.140 --> 47:50.740]  sheen wasn't involved they were never going to make it they're a bunch of liars well now it's in
[47:50.740 --> 47:54.900]  the new york times now you know the hell we went through who knows what hell will go through in the
[47:54.900 --> 48:01.300]  future to bring you that information and that's why charlie sheen is such an amazing individual
[48:01.300 --> 48:08.500]  there's other stuff i know about that you couldn't believe that i was eyewitness to that i was eyewitness
[48:08.500 --> 48:12.900]  too well i mean she put it in the in the divorce thing that that you know that that and that she
[48:12.900 --> 48:18.340]  went public and made all that stuff up about him because nine eleven truth and he was involved in
[48:18.340 --> 48:24.420]  it that was in the divorce i can say that because it's public but you have no idea what this guy
[48:24.420 --> 48:28.900]  went through you haven't heard one-tenth but he doesn't want me to tell you about it so i'm not
[48:28.900 --> 48:33.860]  going to tell you about it he said he stood there and took all those lies and all the worst things
[48:33.860 --> 48:38.100]  they can say about you in the media we knew republican operatives were running the whole thing
[48:38.100 --> 48:45.220]  we know their names all of it and charlie sheen sat there and took the whole deal when the guy
[48:45.220 --> 48:50.340]  makes hundreds of millions of dollars and all of that was threatened everything was threatened
[48:50.340 --> 48:55.380]  and he never backed off he was told basically you need to back off and and say that you never
[48:55.380 --> 48:59.540]  said this you need to go back on nine eleven truth and then o'reilly went on the news and
[48:59.540 --> 49:04.980]  lied and said charlie sheen has gone back on nine eleven truth and charlie called me and gave me a
[49:04.980 --> 49:09.780]  statement to post where he said i have not gone back on nine eleven truth this is completely made
[49:09.780 --> 49:15.860]  up so when he refused to go back on it they turned all that media dirt loose on him they went after
[49:15.860 --> 49:21.860]  him they tried to destroy him and then they tried to go back and had and announced that he said he
[49:21.860 --> 49:27.140]  wasn't with nine eleven truth with no evidence was just made up and then he had to go public again
[49:27.140 --> 49:31.700]  and say no i'm still with nine eleven truth and then they came after him again with things you
[49:31.700 --> 49:38.660]  couldn't imagine and he didn't back off now that's courage folks when you're a wealthy person when you
[49:38.660 --> 49:43.780]  got a lot to lose when you're being threatened in ways you can't imagine until you've been there and
[49:43.780 --> 49:50.180]  he stuck it out he stayed with the truth and he did a great job so we salute charlie sheen we
[49:50.180 --> 49:55.700]  salute everybody we salute mark cuban we don't blame him for backing out the point is charlie
[49:55.700 --> 50:01.140]  sheen never backed out of that and i never backed out of it and i'm never backing down this is

[53:55.780 --> 54:00.980]  gentlemen um we've got uh at the eight after microbarrow coming up and then for two hours we've
[54:00.980 --> 54:04.820]  got ellen watt joining us today we'll have open phones with both those gentlemen but for this
[54:04.820 --> 54:10.980]  segment the next yesterday ted anderson two weeks ago listen to me carefully okay this is
[54:10.980 --> 54:16.260]  reality ted anderson who owns genesis and minus resources and makes all this possible
[54:16.980 --> 54:24.340]  he offered you gold at 740 he bought the gold at 740 so it was priced in at 740 when gold was
[54:24.340 --> 54:33.780]  840 it's 880 last time i checked a few minutes ago so uh that is 140 dollars above that gold's
[54:33.780 --> 54:40.740]  all gone now he sold the gold that he bought at 740 i mean you could not find a deal like that
[54:40.740 --> 54:45.780]  anywhere everywhere else it's huge premiums if you can get it he has a new group of coins that he
[54:45.780 --> 54:54.260]  bought at 773 that is still over a hundred dollars less than gold is currently trading for when ted
[54:54.260 --> 54:59.380]  buys gold early and then it goes up he passes on all those savings to you that's how he does this you
[54:59.380 --> 55:05.460]  will not find a deal like this anywhere and yesterday i put the call out to people and uh folks didn't
[55:05.460 --> 55:10.980]  didn't really call they didn't they didn't want to get frank's uh that were by the way uncirculated
[55:10.980 --> 55:18.580]  you i mean this is insane and british sovereigns folks this you you will not find a deal like this
[55:18.580 --> 55:24.900]  anywhere you are insane now now it's gone up 30 bucks but it doesn't matter gold itself is shot
[55:24.900 --> 55:32.980]  up 30 bucks today so it's over a hundred dollars what it is currently trading for under a hundred
[55:32.980 --> 55:37.620]  dollars ted again up until a few months ago you've never done deals anywhere near this this is the
[55:37.620 --> 55:45.300]  fourth time you've offered a deal that is a hundred dollars under what it should be per ounce of
[55:45.300 --> 55:52.260]  gold uh i mean did do we have words to describe to people how good this deal is you're explaining
[55:52.260 --> 55:57.060]  it like it is i can tell you right now the thing about it is i've never had a market like this that
[55:57.060 --> 56:01.540]  i could do this in i mean the united states government is making it so easy for me in the
[56:01.540 --> 56:06.980]  federal reserve they just cut interest rates down to zero the lowest it's ever been and that will
[56:06.980 --> 56:11.220]  kill the dollar and t bills that's what's happening right now internationally the dollar's falling
[56:11.220 --> 56:16.180]  right now just drop below 80 and the reserve has announced that they're now because the dollar's
[56:16.180 --> 56:21.220]  going to die issue their own t bills that do have interest so they're they're killing the economy so
[56:21.220 --> 56:26.740]  they can be the only lender well the old any gold dealer in their right mind right now would go hey
[56:26.740 --> 56:31.300]  i'm going to buy as much as i can at this point because my customers are going to want to buy this
[56:31.300 --> 56:36.900]  at a hundred dollars higher you know it right now the market is just saying hey i mean it's in bold
[56:36.900 --> 56:42.100]  print you don't need to be a great economist to figure this one out it's right there buy gold buy
[56:42.100 --> 56:46.740]  gold i mean what more do you need quickly quickly to tell tell folks the new group of coins you've
[56:46.740 --> 56:51.620]  got at a hundred plus dollars under what the market currently is here's what i have right now i've
[56:51.620 --> 56:57.700]  got the british sovereigns there at 252 which is a little higher but that is based upon that 770
[56:57.700 --> 57:03.060]  price range and then i have the frank said 203 and alex i just looked i still have the walking
[57:03.060 --> 57:11.700]  liberties at 840 and silver now is well well today it hit a high of 1159 it's up almost three bucks
[57:11.700 --> 57:16.260]  that's the same price i was offering them for when silver was down in the nine dollar range
[57:16.260 --> 57:22.740]  so i mean i you can't find a better time to be buying gold and you can't have better fundamentals
[57:22.740 --> 57:32.340]  to tell you to do it now you have to move 800 686 2237 800 686 2237 they are there now
[57:33.140 --> 57:37.860]  ted how long you you made a new i'll hold it till midnight i don't know what's going to happen
[57:37.860 --> 57:42.500]  after that the market is way too volatile for me to know i hope i could offer this tomorrow
[57:42.500 --> 57:46.580]  but i can't make a promise again it's going up folks but it's still a hundred dollars under the
[57:46.580 --> 57:55.940]  market thank you for listening to gcm visit gcmlive.com today

[1:01:09.780 --> 1:01:15.460]  time the you know i by this time next year the inflation that's going to be coming in the
[1:01:15.460 --> 1:01:22.500]  and the in the destruction of the economy the united states losing a world you know world status
[1:01:22.500 --> 1:01:26.660]  as the reserve currency yeah let me explain that that that was the only question i didn't get to
[1:01:26.660 --> 1:01:32.500]  with ron paul was on with us for 20 minutes at the first the hour of the last hour is the fact
[1:01:32.500 --> 1:01:37.860]  that the federal reserve is destroying the dollar buying up the world with the last remnants of it
[1:01:37.860 --> 1:01:42.260]  as they devalue it and then openly announcing the new york times they are going to openly take over
[1:01:42.260 --> 1:01:47.620]  the governments of the west and that the private banks will now issue the new t bills by cutting
[1:01:48.180 --> 1:01:54.500]  the interest rates to zero they've never been that low that further kills u.s bonds u.s debt
[1:01:54.500 --> 1:02:00.420]  issuance to the world and that's why people are now fleeing the dollar again and so then they're
[1:02:00.420 --> 1:02:05.860]  going to basically i implode the u.s and then again make the private banks the new governmental
[1:02:05.860 --> 1:02:12.580]  structures and make you pay taxes to them new york state is passing 88 new taxes to squeeze the
[1:02:12.580 --> 1:02:18.260]  public other states are doing this we're going into a hellish situation all these top trans
[1:02:18.260 --> 1:02:24.580]  forecasters the prime minister of canada are seeing depression marshal law the army's announcing
[1:02:24.580 --> 1:02:29.300]  their training to engage the american people all i can tell you is it feels really good to be able
[1:02:29.300 --> 1:02:35.860]  to get on air and and and and and offer gold to people at a hundred dollars under what the market
[1:02:35.860 --> 1:02:40.100]  is right now folks i i wish some of you were educated out there because some of you i don't
[1:02:40.100 --> 1:02:46.260]  think are about how good a deal this is because ted all the other dealers buy gold when it's low
[1:02:46.260 --> 1:02:50.820]  and then when it's high they sell it at that price and they can sell it all day long ted
[1:02:50.820 --> 1:02:56.260]  sells it from the lower position which annihilates his competition most his competition can't even
[1:02:56.260 --> 1:03:00.740]  get gold and silver right now because they haven't been around that long ted's been around 30 years
[1:03:00.740 --> 1:03:06.820]  so he has contacts nobody else has i mean companies have around 10 years 12 years 15 years are sold
[1:03:06.820 --> 1:03:12.660]  out or can only sell you one coin at a huge premium ted again tell folks the coins you've got quickly
[1:03:12.660 --> 1:03:17.620]  well the frank is a one-fifth of an ounce of gold it's 203 we have the british sovereign that's a
[1:03:17.620 --> 1:03:24.100]  quarter ounce coin it's 252 and really the best buy that i have out here hands down is the walking
[1:03:24.100 --> 1:03:29.940]  liberty that coin right now at eight dollars and 40 cents has seen silver go from nine dollars
[1:03:29.940 --> 1:03:35.700]  and about 40 cents now to 11 dollars and 50 some sense and by the way the franks you've got are
[1:03:35.700 --> 1:03:42.580]  uncirculated which is normally a premium no premium on that 806 86 2237 the brokers will be there
[1:03:42.580 --> 1:03:47.300]  till midnight and then this deal is going to be gone i mean was that position big that you got
[1:03:47.300 --> 1:03:53.860]  last week pretty pretty substantial alexie okay but you're only offering this until midnight tonight
[1:03:53.860 --> 1:03:57.380]  well i can offer it till midnight tonight because i'm getting orders i mean a lot of people that

[1:04:05.620 --> 1:04:10.660]  we're right back hello friends this is alex jones i've told you for a long time it's important to
[1:04:10.660 --> 1:04:15.220]  be self-sufficient and today that's more important than ever we need to be independent and food and
[1:04:15.220 --> 1:04:19.780]  water is the key you'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread you'll never
[1:04:19.780 --> 1:04:24.580]  have to go to the superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency if you
[1:04:24.580 --> 1:04:29.220]  simply prepare our elected representatives wanted a good old boy bailout for the special interest
[1:04:29.220 --> 1:04:33.620]  so they ignored your screams not to do it they turned off the telephones and email they voted
[1:04:33.620 --> 1:04:39.300]  to print 850 billion dollars at least out of thin air this money now owns the american and european
[1:04:39.300 --> 1:04:44.420]  banks the exploding inflation that is now guaranteed will slash your life savings to nothing and
[1:04:44.420 --> 1:04:50.260]  blast the cost of necessities particularly food beyond many americans reach in pre-nazi germany
[1:04:50.260 --> 1:04:55.380]  super inflation the cost of a loaf of bread doubled every two days until it reached over four billion
[1:04:55.380 --> 1:05:01.220]  marks food prices are skyrocketing so fast there seems as if there may be no end in sight the private
[1:05:01.220 --> 1:05:05.460]  banks merging with our government are refusing to loan grocery stores enough money to restock
[1:05:05.460 --> 1:05:10.500]  their shelves the stores have less food but jack up prices to stay in business whatever happens in
[1:05:10.500 --> 1:05:15.140]  america we need to be prepared and be ready everything is zeroing in on food one third of
[1:05:15.140 --> 1:05:19.780]  americans have to choose between buying food and paying for other necessities my friends whatever
[1:05:19.780 --> 1:05:24.580]  it takes get prepared get self-sufficient get food for everybody out there listening it's very
[1:05:24.580 --> 1:05:28.420]  important for you to understand that by having a supply of storable food the government the new
[1:05:28.420 --> 1:05:33.380]  old order has a lot less control over you and so it's a mindset a mindset of self-sufficiency
[1:05:33.380 --> 1:05:37.620]  and preparedness no one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you
[1:05:37.620 --> 1:05:42.580]  know efoodsdirect.com is still able to ship storeable food that's safe from e-coli salmonella

[1:06:48.820 --> 1:06:52.500]  let me just finish up with what i was saying about the economy and we're going to micro vera for the
[1:06:52.500 --> 1:07:01.140]  rest of the hour and your phone calls at 1-800-259-9231 i have been studying the new world order for 15
[1:07:01.140 --> 1:07:06.980]  years i have interviewed again world experts on finance trends forecasters intelligence officers
[1:07:06.980 --> 1:07:13.700]  former cia section chiefs you name it it is a fact that they are going to implode the world economy
[1:07:14.340 --> 1:07:18.820]  to a much greater extent we've already seen it is a fact that no major investment
[1:07:18.820 --> 1:07:24.420]  in any brokerage firm in any stocks or bonds is completely safe it is a fact that your annuities
[1:07:24.420 --> 1:07:30.020]  are not protected it is a fact that they have already devalued your 401ks on average more than 50
[1:07:30.020 --> 1:07:36.100]  percent some cases 70 percent it is a fact that they're rating the pension funds it is a fact that
[1:07:36.100 --> 1:07:43.460]  four plus trillion was two trillion on september 10th 2001 the ap reported it was several trillion
[1:07:43.460 --> 1:07:49.220]  and that numbers from 2006 the last time i saw a arm services committee hearing where the military
[1:07:49.220 --> 1:07:53.780]  admitted four trillion has been stolen and missing and rumsfeld and mires at the time wouldn't say
[1:07:53.780 --> 1:07:59.780]  where it went don't end up like the people that invested now over a hundred billion dollars it's
[1:07:59.780 --> 1:08:05.220]  growing every day with a made-off who was the former head of the new york's of the nasdaq in new
[1:08:05.220 --> 1:08:10.980]  york the second largest stock exchange in the world again it's now come out in the news and we
[1:08:10.980 --> 1:08:14.740]  have these stories up on info wars dot com and prison planet dot com i intend to get into them
[1:08:14.740 --> 1:08:19.220]  later they're here in my stack that he was tied in with brokerage firms and banks and they were
[1:08:19.220 --> 1:08:24.660]  part of the whole thing the scc was part of it and covered it up that's now in the wall street
[1:08:24.660 --> 1:08:30.420]  journal this was done by design that's the type of characters they're all a bunch of made-offs up
[1:08:30.420 --> 1:08:35.300]  there they control the western intelligence agencies they've intended to make this heist
[1:08:35.300 --> 1:08:40.100]  for decades the imf and world bank documents show that they're now doing it and i believe it's even
[1:08:40.100 --> 1:08:46.260]  gotten out of their control i mean this which is even more dangerous so when i tell you that
[1:08:46.260 --> 1:08:51.860]  ted anerson bought gold right now at a hundred and seven dollars under what gold is selling for
[1:08:51.860 --> 1:08:56.660]  when he made the buys it was when gold was a hundred plus dollars under what it is now
[1:08:56.660 --> 1:09:04.100]  so his tiny four percent markup literally just to take the orders is is is is is done as a loss
[1:09:04.100 --> 1:09:13.140]  leader to again position himself in the market as as as a major force which is happening so again
[1:09:13.140 --> 1:09:17.460]  that he is annihilating the competition research the gold and silver deals he just offered for
[1:09:17.460 --> 1:09:22.820]  yourself but do it quickly because yesterday he was offering gold at seven forty when it was eight
[1:09:22.820 --> 1:09:28.900]  forty five over a hundred dollars up now it's at eight eighty again and it's only gone up to a seven
[1:09:28.900 --> 1:09:34.980]  seventy buy so it's over a hundred dollars under what the market is as dangerous as this economy
[1:09:34.980 --> 1:09:40.340]  is and as a system is you are insane not to physically hold some gold and silver and you
[1:09:40.340 --> 1:09:45.380]  were insane not to take the deal that ted was just offering so last time i'm plugging it today
[1:09:45.380 --> 1:09:50.180]  i don't normally spend ten minutes on this but it's so important eight hundred six eight six two
[1:09:50.180 --> 1:09:56.660]  two three seven eight hundred six eight six two two three seven because again ted smart and buys
[1:09:56.660 --> 1:10:00.420]  when it's low and then he still gives you that price later i believe it's only going to go up and
[1:10:00.420 --> 1:10:05.620]  up and up and that's what i've got just scores of articles in front of me just go to cnbc go to cnn
[1:10:05.620 --> 1:10:11.300]  you know go to the gold sites like kitco and read what the big guys are saying fifteen hundred
[1:10:11.300 --> 1:10:15.620]  two thousand dollar gold announced in the next year i don't know what that's going to happen i just
[1:10:15.620 --> 1:10:20.580]  know that made off and his criminal crew can't get a hold of the gold and silver you physically hold
[1:10:20.580 --> 1:10:26.420]  so eight hundred six eight six two two three seven i have got a lot to talk about with micro vero
[1:10:26.420 --> 1:10:30.180]  and he normally has a monthly visit with us what the first tuesday of the month and we screwed up
[1:10:30.180 --> 1:10:34.100]  and didn't have mom that day so i apologize we've been moving studios and things that have been a
[1:10:34.100 --> 1:10:39.060]  bit distracted but we're now here in our new operation center and it's great to have the
[1:10:39.060 --> 1:10:43.940]  editor-in-chief over at what really happened dot com also a talk show host weeknights from five to
[1:10:43.940 --> 1:10:50.020]  seven p.m. uh... right here on the gc n radio network it's always great to have mike revero on
[1:10:50.020 --> 1:10:55.620]  with us with so much happening uh... mike out of the gates uh... the worsening financial implosion
[1:10:55.620 --> 1:11:01.380]  open uh... talk of military on the streets the army's now officially says in the army war college
[1:11:01.380 --> 1:11:04.340]  they are preparing to make war with the american people
[1:11:04.340 --> 1:11:10.180]  i mean this is even for me it's hard to believe they're actually admitting it which tells me the
[1:11:10.180 --> 1:11:15.140]  fact that they're emerging and and and uncloking themselves they're having to do that because
[1:11:15.140 --> 1:11:18.180]  they really think that they're going to do it you agree with that statement
[1:11:18.180 --> 1:11:21.700]  oh absolutely i agree with that i mean they're they're looking right now what's happening over
[1:11:21.700 --> 1:11:27.060]  in greece and spain and denmark in italy and france and iceland and thailand and they're realizing
[1:11:27.060 --> 1:11:32.580]  we've hit that flashpoint where the people of the world are realizing that it's all this globalism
[1:11:32.580 --> 1:11:36.900]  and the global economy and all the rest of this nonsense that has created this incredible crisis
[1:11:36.900 --> 1:11:40.980]  that we're all suffering through right now they're seeing the situations like made off
[1:11:40.980 --> 1:11:46.580]  and uh... realizing that you know they don't deserve these depths of poverty into which
[1:11:46.580 --> 1:11:51.540]  they're being driven that the situation is being created for them i mean we've got the american
[1:11:51.540 --> 1:11:56.260]  people who are looking at the u.s. government giving tax credits to corporations to ship high
[1:11:56.260 --> 1:12:02.660]  paying jobs to other countries just at a moment when the debt crisis really became out of control
[1:12:02.660 --> 1:12:06.420]  and so people are waking up and they're saying i'm not going to blame myself for all of this
[1:12:06.420 --> 1:12:10.500]  trouble i'm in and the job i'm loosing in the house i'm losing it's not my fault it's the
[1:12:10.500 --> 1:12:16.420]  government's fault people are getting angry which is a normal healthy uh... reaction to the situation
[1:12:16.420 --> 1:12:20.740]  they're learning how to hate again they're realizing it's okay to feel hate toward people
[1:12:20.740 --> 1:12:25.460]  in institutions that do hateful things and the u.s. government realizes they have pushed us to the
[1:12:25.460 --> 1:12:30.420]  point of an outright open rebellion and i don't like violence and i don't like any of that bloody
[1:12:30.420 --> 1:12:34.900]  messy stuff but it just seems like we're right on the edge and they know and they knew that when
[1:12:34.900 --> 1:12:39.540]  they engineered this the people would rebel that's why they've geared up and quietly gotten rid of
[1:12:39.540 --> 1:12:44.180]  posse commentatus and have marines outrunning checkpoints against the american people that's
[1:12:44.180 --> 1:12:50.500]  in mainstream news uh... clearly they engineered and set all this up and and and knew that people
[1:12:50.500 --> 1:12:54.980]  would rebel but i'm seeing real concern in their actions i think they're starting to realize
[1:12:54.980 --> 1:12:59.460]  that they're not invincible and that uh... you know they're up there in their ivory towers
[1:12:59.460 --> 1:13:04.100]  megalomaniacs on power trips thinking they're invincible like hitler going into russia
[1:13:04.100 --> 1:13:07.700]  in north africa and i think they're starting to realize that their new world order is dead on
[1:13:07.700 --> 1:13:13.460]  arrival i want you to comment on that and then b did you see last week the financial times of
[1:13:13.460 --> 1:13:18.100]  london and other publications in a concerted effort with headlines like and now for world
[1:13:18.100 --> 1:13:22.500]  government admitting that there's a world government admitting they've covertly set it up it's all in
[1:13:22.500 --> 1:13:27.940]  the story and admitting the editor of that paper by the way mister wilson bill deberg
[1:13:27.940 --> 1:13:33.300]  and admitting that it's tyrannical and undemocratic but saying the lie comes in
[1:13:33.300 --> 1:13:37.860]  with all but we didn't engineer this collapse of world government oven by the bankers
[1:13:37.860 --> 1:13:44.180]  will save you i mean how incredible is it mike to see them openly saying it's world government
[1:13:44.980 --> 1:13:49.700]  well allow to respond to the first part first i'm in agreement with you that i think uh... the
[1:13:49.700 --> 1:13:54.740]  u.s. government the power players are realizing that they might not be able to control a revolution
[1:13:54.740 --> 1:13:58.580]  if it's large enough and look what just happened in greece they've literally the country has run
[1:13:58.580 --> 1:14:03.140]  out of tear gas and still the protesters are coming they grabbed a tv station the other day
[1:14:03.140 --> 1:14:07.140]  they're getting their message out on the air a lot of people are seeing the echoes of the old
[1:14:07.140 --> 1:14:11.620]  uh... network you know i'm i'm mad as heck and i'm i'm not going to take it anymore and this is a
[1:14:11.620 --> 1:14:17.780]  real revolution this isn't some counter coup color revolution this is real organic rebellion
[1:14:17.780 --> 1:14:22.740]  it absolutely is people are angry and when the entire population is angry the u.s. government
[1:14:22.740 --> 1:14:26.980]  lacks them even with the ray guns and the soldiers in the streets they're not going to be able to
[1:14:26.980 --> 1:14:31.860]  put down a rebellion if it really spreads all across the country and the bottom line is a
[1:14:31.860 --> 1:14:35.780]  rebellion in the united states against the government doesn't have to win doesn't have to
[1:14:35.780 --> 1:14:42.100]  prevail doesn't have to march into washington dc it only has to survive long enough to convince
[1:14:42.100 --> 1:14:46.580]  every foreign investor to yank their money out of the u.s. because it's not going to be safe there
[1:14:46.580 --> 1:14:50.980]  and that will bring the whole system crashing down it's exactly the same strategy that castrow
[1:14:50.980 --> 1:14:54.580]  followed to uh... take down the key stuff now the issue of world government
[1:14:55.380 --> 1:15:00.180]  yeah i think it back to the second comment there uh... you know obviously the people who push for
[1:15:00.740 --> 1:15:04.740]  world government are are going to take advantage of every crisis to push their agenda
[1:15:04.740 --> 1:15:08.980]  just like other people who do the global warming thing with the temperature goes up it's global
[1:15:08.980 --> 1:15:11.940]  warming temperature goes down it's global warming blah blah blah but as far as these
[1:15:11.940 --> 1:15:16.340]  stories that we saw in the newspapers the other day pushing for the for the global government
[1:15:16.340 --> 1:15:21.380]  it's not going to work it is an impossible cell because the people of the world
[1:15:21.380 --> 1:15:25.620]  your audience my audience our readers all those people are protesting in grief
[1:15:25.620 --> 1:15:32.420]  they understand that it was globalism that got us here by tearing down the natural safety barriers
[1:15:32.420 --> 1:15:37.380]  that exist along national borders and so these newspapers come along and say well let's do more
[1:15:37.380 --> 1:15:40.900]  of the same and hope for a different outcome everybody knows that's insane that's a very
[1:15:40.900 --> 1:15:46.420]  definition of insanity is continuing to do the same thing and expecting a different outcome
[1:15:46.420 --> 1:15:51.220]  and everybody understands that globalism is designed to benefit the bankers and the industrialists
[1:15:51.220 --> 1:15:57.220]  and the corporations it is not set up to benefit the the people of the world because it's removing
[1:15:57.220 --> 1:16:02.740]  all the safety barriers and safety devices and local control because we've got this arrogant
[1:16:02.740 --> 1:16:08.580]  group of money people who think that the gods intended they should run it all and whether
[1:16:08.580 --> 1:16:13.540]  it's yeah i mean that's what hitler wanted hitler wanted a globalist empire alexander the great
[1:16:13.540 --> 1:16:20.020]  wanted a globalist empire guess what it doesn't work they both blew it well i agree but you know
[1:16:20.020 --> 1:16:25.380]  the question is why are they now coming out and saying yes we've secretly set up a world
[1:16:25.380 --> 1:16:30.500]  government yes it's for your own good and then actually saying in paper after paper major in
[1:16:30.500 --> 1:16:35.140]  you know marquee papers financial times of one in wall street journal with headlines saying
[1:16:35.140 --> 1:16:40.980]  we need a new world order you want a new world order we will save you and and telling us that
[1:16:40.980 --> 1:16:46.340]  tyranny saying saying the democratic processes are the problem no one's going to buy that everybody
[1:16:46.340 --> 1:16:50.980]  knows it was naft and get everybody knows it was the quote free trade deals in the european union
[1:16:50.980 --> 1:16:55.220]  that did this everybody knows the bankers are a bunch of crooks i mean i can't believe they
[1:16:55.220 --> 1:16:59.300]  think they're going to get away with this well they're raising on a busted flush and it may be
[1:16:59.300 --> 1:17:04.260]  because they're still a little bit out of touch with what's going on in in in the ordinary streets
[1:17:04.260 --> 1:17:09.300]  and factories and schoolyards and and and ordinary places of the world i mean some of these people
[1:17:09.300 --> 1:17:15.060]  who are planning these things they are so isolated from the world and they're surrounded by quadres
[1:17:15.060 --> 1:17:20.980]  of middle managers and yes men who really don't want to give them the bad news about how how bad
[1:17:20.980 --> 1:17:26.500]  things are going out there and so these decisions to run these ads and try and sell this position
[1:17:26.500 --> 1:17:33.060]  these are being made in kind of a vacuum they don't really see what the ordinary people of the world
[1:17:33.060 --> 1:17:38.260]  are thinking and seeing and feeling right now and they're making these decisions based on kind of a
[1:17:38.260 --> 1:17:43.300]  fantasy wishful thinking that we are still dumbed down that we are still going to accept whatever
[1:17:43.300 --> 1:17:48.740]  the tv networks give us or the newspapers give us as absolute truth and that is not real anymore
[1:17:51.140 --> 1:17:55.540]  so mike when we get back let's talk about how you see this unfolding historically what we're
[1:17:55.540 --> 1:18:01.060]  going to see in the next two months six months a year 18 months two years three years historically
[1:18:01.060 --> 1:18:06.180]  how this will probably unfold and play out i'll give my historical analysis and take on that i've
[1:18:06.180 --> 1:18:10.740]  spent a lot of time thinking about it not enough time on air discussing it get your take as well
[1:18:10.740 --> 1:18:19.380]  and then go through some of the other news stay with us it is a big idea a new world order in the

[1:18:32.820 --> 1:18:38.980]  now as they hail the birth of the new world order their great dream of exterminating 80 percent of
[1:18:38.980 --> 1:18:47.620]  humanity is at hand for the first time in history the elite's plan for world government is blown

[1:22:48.180 --> 1:22:57.300]  segment at 1-800-259-9231 going live with alan watt for two hours at prisonplanet.tv and t-minus
[1:22:58.100 --> 1:23:05.940]  35 minutes 15 seconds mike how do you see this unfolding i mean we know the imf and world bank
[1:23:05.940 --> 1:23:10.500]  the military the pentagon the the department of defense the british ministry of defense they've all
[1:23:10.500 --> 1:23:15.060]  put out reports saying that they openly work for foreign banks openly saying that people aren't
[1:23:15.060 --> 1:23:18.500]  going to like what's going to happen i've heard npr for years bragging about how they're going to
[1:23:18.500 --> 1:23:23.620]  lower our standard of living for globalism and the environment and austerity and obama says he's
[1:23:23.620 --> 1:23:30.340]  getting us ready for that so so clearly from all the evidence i've got this is engineered this world
[1:23:30.340 --> 1:23:36.340]  crisis they're bringing us into uh... and obviously with rioting on the streets some of the public
[1:23:36.340 --> 1:23:41.780]  after a while are going to beg for police state uh... to you know to supposedly bring order then the
[1:23:41.780 --> 1:23:47.060]  imf is going to blame the rioting on the depression that comes they do that in third world countries
[1:23:47.060 --> 1:23:54.660]  and that's in their uh... hundred point plan of how they carry this out uh... i mean how do we
[1:23:54.660 --> 1:23:59.700]  how do we defeat this because some people want rioting i don't want rioting because i know that
[1:23:59.700 --> 1:24:03.380]  after a few months of it people will then basically beg the government to come in and pick up the
[1:24:03.380 --> 1:24:08.020]  pieces when it's the government the private ponzi scheme operators that orchestrated it micro vero
[1:24:08.740 --> 1:24:13.860]  well the bottom line with that is that all of these ponzi scheme systems and that includes
[1:24:13.860 --> 1:24:19.700]  the federal reserve itself you really cannot survive if you continue to lower everybody's
[1:24:19.700 --> 1:24:24.980]  standard of living because well let's take a look at the united states right now we have built up this
[1:24:24.980 --> 1:24:30.980]  huge debt over burden both within the government within consumer debt within corporate debt
[1:24:30.980 --> 1:24:36.420]  now everything is fine as long as the workers who are the bottom of that financial pyramid
[1:24:36.420 --> 1:24:40.340]  are able to keep making the same money they've been making so that they can service their debt
[1:24:40.340 --> 1:24:45.140]  they can make their payments if you start saying for the sake of the new world order and the
[1:24:45.140 --> 1:24:50.420]  environment and all the rest of it we've got everybody to live like six in a room and take
[1:24:50.420 --> 1:24:56.180]  bicycles and have none of that stuff anymore than a huge portion of commerce is going to collapse
[1:24:56.180 --> 1:25:02.500]  that supports that population if you get the whole world living for or or needing much less
[1:25:02.500 --> 1:25:08.180]  to get by than the industries and economies that have built up around supporting the needs of
[1:25:08.180 --> 1:25:12.900]  that society they're going to start falling apart and that revenue stream is going to drive
[1:25:12.900 --> 1:25:17.140]  dry up and i think this is an aspect of the new world order that they're not really paying
[1:25:17.140 --> 1:25:21.620]  attention to that where we're seeing it just in the way they're handling the current u.s. economic
[1:25:21.620 --> 1:25:27.060]  crisis they're operating as if they still believe that the american people still have huge amounts
[1:25:27.060 --> 1:25:31.620]  of money hidden in their mattresses or in their bedroom closets that uh you know we've already
[1:25:31.620 --> 1:25:38.100]  got uh you know they're talking yet about taxes on on drinks in a bar taxes on downloaded music
[1:25:38.100 --> 1:25:41.620]  the only solution the government seems to have for any problem is for a new tax and what they
[1:25:41.620 --> 1:25:47.380]  don't understand is there's nothing out here left to tax and when people are having to they're losing
[1:25:47.380 --> 1:25:51.460]  their 80 000 a year job and they're having to take a 40 000 a year job that means they
[1:25:51.460 --> 1:25:56.500]  got less to tax well that's my next point that was my next question and that's why i love revero
[1:25:56.500 --> 1:26:01.620]  i mean he historically is right on target and you know even adds a lot of uh uh key nuances
[1:26:01.620 --> 1:26:06.660]  that i don't think about uh but the new york daily news is reporting that they're on the verge
[1:26:07.460 --> 1:26:16.020]  of passing um not just a new york city but statewide 88 new taxes on all soft drinks ipod tax
[1:26:16.020 --> 1:26:22.420]  movie theater tax sporting event tax so that that that's internet tax there by the way over and so
[1:26:22.420 --> 1:26:27.940]  that'll set the model in the precedent for the whole country uh taxi tax bus tax limo tax cable
[1:26:27.940 --> 1:26:34.260]  tax radio tax clothing tax uh on and on and on 88 new taxes at the state level they're talking
[1:26:34.260 --> 1:26:40.660]  about 50 plus taxes on top of that at the city level it's like they're trying to squeeze us into open
[1:26:40.660 --> 1:26:45.060]  rebellion well they're just trying to squeeze us for all the money that they can get and like i
[1:26:45.060 --> 1:26:49.620]  said their attitude is there's always more out there the people will come up with it we just
[1:26:49.620 --> 1:26:53.700]  have to take it and give it to somebody else which is all that government really does but the problem
[1:26:53.700 --> 1:26:59.140]  is that the economy is already weak and taxes are increasing the load and we're already at the
[1:26:59.140 --> 1:27:05.060]  point where the engine of the economy is stuttering and is ready to stall out and fail completely
[1:27:05.060 --> 1:27:10.740]  and that is really where we are and you know if the government really wanted to save the economy
[1:27:10.740 --> 1:27:16.900]  they could save the economy overnight by flashing federal taxes 50 percent across the board now we
[1:27:16.900 --> 1:27:21.860]  have to give up certain things like killing asian people or middle eastern people but i for one
[1:27:21.860 --> 1:27:26.900]  am willing to make that sacrifice but if you cut federal taxes 50 percent across the board the
[1:27:26.900 --> 1:27:31.700]  economy would explode overnight and everything would be fine and we'd be off and running again
[1:27:31.700 --> 1:27:36.260]  but the government won't do that one thing what what are they doing they keep doing what they've
[1:27:36.260 --> 1:27:40.900]  been doing before and expecting it's going to change the outcome because they want control
[1:27:40.900 --> 1:27:45.700]  because they're control freaks and they love taxes to then give it to their corporate buddies
[1:27:47.300 --> 1:27:51.300]  again they tax you take your money put it in the pension funds the city funds
[1:27:51.300 --> 1:27:56.180]  they then invest it in the Ponzi schemes even the local employees don't even get the money
[1:27:56.180 --> 1:28:01.540]  only the bankers get it it's all about social engineering and control microvaro stay with us

[1:31:59.280 --> 1:32:01.780]  I don't own them clothes
[1:32:01.780 --> 1:32:04.280]  Again, for new listeners,
[1:32:04.280 --> 1:32:07.780]  you're not gonna hear this on CNBC or CNN or Fox,
[1:32:07.780 --> 1:32:09.780]  but we have former heads of the World Bank on
[1:32:09.780 --> 1:32:12.280]  or top economists, Nobel Prize winners,
[1:32:12.280 --> 1:32:15.280]  you will hear this information.
[1:32:15.280 --> 1:32:17.780]  The information we're covering is the reality.
[1:32:17.780 --> 1:32:19.780]  We keep telling you the Federal Reserve is foreign,
[1:32:19.780 --> 1:32:23.280]  it's private, it was creating giant Ponzi schemes derivatives.
[1:32:23.280 --> 1:32:25.780]  You can go back to my show 10, 11 years ago,
[1:32:25.780 --> 1:32:28.780]  when I have economists like George Humphries on,
[1:32:28.780 --> 1:32:30.780]  covering what was gonna happen in the future.
[1:32:30.780 --> 1:32:32.280]  People said, oh, you're just going to do them.
[1:32:32.280 --> 1:32:35.280]  We said, no, when you've got hundreds and hundreds of times,
[1:32:35.280 --> 1:32:39.280]  you know, fiat derivatives compared to all the real currency in the world,
[1:32:39.280 --> 1:32:41.780]  and they're taking the city, the county, the private,
[1:32:41.780 --> 1:32:45.780]  pension funds, the stock market, the 401ks, and investing it.
[1:32:45.780 --> 1:32:49.780]  We saw even five, six years ago, the elite started taking their money,
[1:32:49.780 --> 1:32:54.780]  their investment sound, and putting it into hard assets, media, infrastructure,
[1:32:54.780 --> 1:32:59.780]  roads, power plants, you know, nuclear power companies,
[1:32:59.780 --> 1:33:02.780]  defense contractors, roads.
[1:33:02.780 --> 1:33:04.780]  They were getting out of the stock market.
[1:33:04.780 --> 1:33:06.280]  They were getting out of derivatives.
[1:33:06.280 --> 1:33:08.780]  They were getting out while they took your money.
[1:33:08.780 --> 1:33:12.780]  I mean, I made the film comprehensive annual financial reports exposed,
[1:33:12.780 --> 1:33:18.780]  where only about 35% of the tax money you pay even goes to government services,
[1:33:18.780 --> 1:33:20.780]  whether you want them or not.
[1:33:20.780 --> 1:33:26.780]  The majority, 60-plus percent, goes into the comprehensive financial system,
[1:33:26.780 --> 1:33:30.780]  which is the double set of books, which is the investments in Wall Street
[1:33:30.780 --> 1:33:33.780]  and the international banking cartel.
[1:33:33.780 --> 1:33:38.780]  So they certainly engineered this to consolidate, to vertically integrate wealth,
[1:33:38.780 --> 1:33:44.780]  but now we're going into a situation where we already have millions and millions
[1:33:44.780 --> 1:33:46.780]  of people that have lost their homes.
[1:33:46.780 --> 1:33:49.780]  Hundreds of thousands of people lose their homes every month.
[1:33:49.780 --> 1:33:51.780]  Millions and millions more are going to lose their homes,
[1:33:51.780 --> 1:33:55.780]  or lose their jobs, or have to be downsized, or get two or three jobs
[1:33:55.780 --> 1:33:59.780]  if they can find them, unemployment at all-time records, the dollar in floating,
[1:33:59.780 --> 1:34:05.780]  hyperinflation now rising back up, and the people are going to riot,
[1:34:05.780 --> 1:34:07.780]  they're going to protest, they're going to demonstrate,
[1:34:07.780 --> 1:34:09.780]  the police are going to attack the peaceful crowds,
[1:34:09.780 --> 1:34:12.780]  they've been trained to do that by the feds, the public's going to get violent,
[1:34:12.780 --> 1:34:15.780]  and then that's the pretext to bring even more troops in,
[1:34:15.780 --> 1:34:18.780]  and the media will spin it that the people cause the depression.
[1:34:18.780 --> 1:34:22.780]  They're also saying that the auto industry is going to cause the depression,
[1:34:22.780 --> 1:34:27.780]  as if all of this happened because of them, or it all happened because of subprime mortgages,
[1:34:27.780 --> 1:34:30.780]  which after they got the banker takeover power, eight weeks ago,
[1:34:30.780 --> 1:34:33.780]  you notice day one, they said, oh no, it's not subprime,
[1:34:33.780 --> 1:34:36.780]  we're just going to take the money secretly and not tell you where it went.
[1:34:36.780 --> 1:34:41.780]  Microvero, I have to pinch myself, even knowing how arrogant and corrupt the elites are,
[1:34:41.780 --> 1:34:46.780]  to see them on the news saying, we're not going to tell you where the 8.5 trillion went.
[1:34:46.780 --> 1:34:48.780]  Now people will say, wait a minute, it says 2 trillion.
[1:34:48.780 --> 1:34:53.780]  That's when Bloomberg sued six weeks ago, folks.
[1:34:53.780 --> 1:34:55.780]  It was 2 trillion that had been stolen then.
[1:34:55.780 --> 1:34:57.780]  Now it's 8.5, and that number's old.
[1:34:57.780 --> 1:34:58.780]  It's much more than that.
[1:34:58.780 --> 1:35:01.780]  So where is this going where the Congress has no power?
[1:35:01.780 --> 1:35:06.780]  The people have no power, and open criminal foreign banks that engineered the crisis
[1:35:06.780 --> 1:35:10.780]  are now in control of the executive saying they're going to use the U.S. Army on us
[1:35:10.780 --> 1:35:12.780]  if we don't take the raping and like it,
[1:35:12.780 --> 1:35:15.780]  and then the people are all losing their houses and their jobs,
[1:35:15.780 --> 1:35:19.780]  and the police are out everywhere writing tickets in Austin, all over the country,
[1:35:19.780 --> 1:35:24.780]  and 88 new taxes, and just, I mean, my God, they are forcing a confrontation.
[1:35:24.780 --> 1:35:29.780]  I don't, I agree, the pressure is definitely building towards a confrontation.
[1:35:29.780 --> 1:35:34.780]  I don't know that they necessarily want one because I think they've reached the point of realizing
[1:35:34.780 --> 1:35:38.780]  they may not be able to control it because they've only got so many military,
[1:35:38.780 --> 1:35:41.780]  and again, go back to look at what's happening in Greece right now.
[1:35:41.780 --> 1:35:43.780]  They've run out of tear gas.
[1:35:43.780 --> 1:35:45.780]  The protesters are taking the TV stations.
[1:35:45.780 --> 1:35:50.780]  You know, they're using pocket lasers to blind the police troops.
[1:35:50.780 --> 1:35:54.780]  They are dazzling, not permanently blind them, but they're using lasers to get in their eyes,
[1:35:54.780 --> 1:35:56.780]  and they're winning, basically.
[1:35:56.780 --> 1:35:59.780]  Again, when you're talking about a popular uprising,
[1:35:59.780 --> 1:36:05.780]  victory doesn't depend on walking into the capital city and battering down the doors of the White House.
[1:36:05.780 --> 1:36:10.780]  You just have to survive long enough to make it obvious that the government is no longer in control
[1:36:10.780 --> 1:36:13.780]  of the territories, what we're seeing up in Afghanistan.
[1:36:13.780 --> 1:36:15.780]  The U.S. is standing there saying, yes, we're winning the war,
[1:36:15.780 --> 1:36:19.780]  and yet the Taliban is now in control of most of Afghanistan.
[1:36:19.780 --> 1:36:21.780]  They're running their own court system.
[1:36:21.780 --> 1:36:23.780]  They're running their own police forces.
[1:36:23.780 --> 1:36:25.780]  They've become the de facto civil administrators.
[1:36:25.780 --> 1:36:27.780]  Now, as far as what's going to be happening here in the U.S.,
[1:36:27.780 --> 1:36:30.780]  I think we're headed for a major crash, engineered or not.
[1:36:30.780 --> 1:36:33.780]  I don't think anybody can control it or it's aftermath.
[1:36:33.780 --> 1:36:40.780]  And worse, because of globalism, we could be looking at literally a repeat of the fall of the Roman Empire.
[1:36:40.780 --> 1:36:46.780]  Rome toward its final days, they were doing bailouts of their collapsing financial systems
[1:36:46.780 --> 1:36:49.780]  and dumping the bill on the taxpayers.
[1:36:49.780 --> 1:36:53.780]  They were overextended across the globe with all these military adventures.
[1:36:53.780 --> 1:36:59.780]  They were in too deep in debt and they paralyzed themselves with their own debt.
[1:36:59.780 --> 1:37:04.780]  And as they got overextended militarily, certain of their little possessions started to break away.
[1:37:04.780 --> 1:37:07.780]  We're seeing South America break away from U.S. influence.
[1:37:07.780 --> 1:37:10.780]  We're seeing Afghanistan may succeed in breaking away from U.S. influence.
[1:37:10.780 --> 1:37:12.780]  It's starting to happen.
[1:37:12.780 --> 1:37:19.780]  A global American empire is starting to fall and we could see a whole new dark ages come out of it,
[1:37:19.780 --> 1:37:24.780]  by which it means that the ultra-rich and ultra-powerful have a real rough time of it.
[1:37:24.780 --> 1:37:28.780]  But the ordinary people, you know, will just get along doing what we've always been doing.
[1:37:28.780 --> 1:37:32.780]  We may revert even to kind of an agrarian society for a little while.
[1:37:32.780 --> 1:37:36.780]  And certainly with our technology, I don't think we're going to go back to the days of the witch burnings,
[1:37:36.780 --> 1:37:40.780]  no matter how much certain religious fundamentalists would like to see that happen.
[1:37:40.780 --> 1:37:47.780]  But I do think this globalist empire, at the point where it is seeing its own fruition,
[1:37:47.780 --> 1:37:50.780]  may in fact be self-destructive.
[1:37:50.780 --> 1:37:55.780]  Well, Mike Rivera, here's my issue.
[1:37:55.780 --> 1:38:00.780]  Again, I know the IMF and World Bank have overthrown hundreds of third-world countries with the exact same system
[1:38:00.780 --> 1:38:05.780]  of coming in, taking over the banking, creating Ponzi schemes, hyping up the economy,
[1:38:05.780 --> 1:38:10.780]  pulling off liquidity, imploding the country by design to criminally consolidate the wealth,
[1:38:10.780 --> 1:38:13.780]  and then set up a dictatorship in the name of quelling the rioting.
[1:38:13.780 --> 1:38:18.780]  Now, that's their official plan. That's in their own documents. They do it by design.
[1:38:18.780 --> 1:38:22.780]  They have other systems for bigger nations like shock therapy, as they call it,
[1:38:22.780 --> 1:38:26.780]  what they did with Russia, the total looting, imploding the economy down to nothing,
[1:38:26.780 --> 1:38:29.780]  and then handing the entire infrastructure over to seven oligarchs.
[1:38:29.780 --> 1:38:33.780]  Now, the globalists are outside any nation.
[1:38:33.780 --> 1:38:38.780]  The United States, as their vehicle, their engine, their warmock, their juggernaut,
[1:38:38.780 --> 1:38:43.780]  to carry this out against the people of the planet.
[1:38:43.780 --> 1:38:47.780]  Now, they're heaping all the blame for globalism against the United States.
[1:38:47.780 --> 1:38:52.780]  The United States falls as a superpower, but the globalists have now amassed all the wealth worldwide,
[1:38:52.780 --> 1:38:56.780]  and so juggling between all the nations, they have us pay the carbon taxes to them.
[1:38:56.780 --> 1:39:01.780]  They're saying it. They control the UN, the NATO military, the remnant of the U.S. military,
[1:39:01.780 --> 1:39:06.780]  and they admit will be their servant system, so they've stated that this was their plan.
[1:39:06.780 --> 1:39:11.780]  We can debate whether or not they're in control of it now, but they're more than happy to have riots.
[1:39:11.780 --> 1:39:15.780]  They're more than happy to have people starving. They're more than happy over and over again in history
[1:39:15.780 --> 1:39:21.780]  to do things like this, and so I think it's clear that we need to go out and tell the public
[1:39:21.780 --> 1:39:25.780]  these people don't need to be in control of the crisis. They engineered it.
[1:39:25.780 --> 1:39:31.780]  They need to be arrested. We need to have that human cry that this guy was the former head of NASDAQ.
[1:39:31.780 --> 1:39:37.780]  That entire group up there are just as guilty as Madoff, and it's come out that the brokerage firms
[1:39:37.780 --> 1:39:41.780]  and big banks, all of them, were working with Madoff and running the scam,
[1:39:41.780 --> 1:39:47.780]  so it's the same class of criminals. They all need to be clapped in irons right now.
[1:39:47.780 --> 1:39:51.780]  Well, I agree with you on that. Absolutely. What I'm saying, I mean, we're both in agreement.
[1:39:51.780 --> 1:39:55.780]  There's this huge plan going on to exploit the world for the benefit of a few.
[1:39:55.780 --> 1:40:01.780]  I'm less optimistic about their being able to succeed, and mostly it's because of radio shows
[1:40:01.780 --> 1:40:05.780]  like yours and mine and our various websites, because all of those times the IMF went out
[1:40:05.780 --> 1:40:10.780]  to these third world countries and pillaged them, it did so basically in the dark.
[1:40:10.780 --> 1:40:15.780]  The rest of the world, the majority of the population was unaware this was going on.
[1:40:15.780 --> 1:40:20.780]  That's no longer true. That's why we're seeing riots in Greece and Denmark and Italy and Iceland.
[1:40:20.780 --> 1:40:24.780]  The world's people have woken up to this scam that is going on.
[1:40:24.780 --> 1:40:28.780]  They're realizing that the systems that they've been living under are not set up for their benefit,
[1:40:28.780 --> 1:40:31.780]  and they're beginning to get very, very angry.
[1:40:31.780 --> 1:40:34.780]  Now, I have an aspect about the Madoff case I'd like to point out to you.
[1:40:34.780 --> 1:40:40.780]  And this is really what makes this clear to people what's really going on here.
[1:40:40.780 --> 1:40:47.780]  If you go to like a flea market and you buy some tires for your car, and it turns out they're stolen,
[1:40:47.780 --> 1:40:51.780]  the police are going to come and get those tires back from you to give back to the rightful owner.
[1:40:51.780 --> 1:40:53.780]  That's the way it's always kind of work.
[1:40:53.780 --> 1:40:56.780]  Even though you didn't know it was stolen, even though you weren't part of the crime,
[1:40:56.780 --> 1:40:59.780]  the stolen property is taken back and returned.
[1:40:59.780 --> 1:41:04.780]  Now, that $50 billion or $100 billion that Madoff has swindled from investors, it didn't disappear.
[1:41:04.780 --> 1:41:08.780]  It's not gone. It's in the hands of his earlier investors.
[1:41:08.780 --> 1:41:12.780]  So following the same pattern that the police would use where you and I,
[1:41:12.780 --> 1:41:17.780]  they should fix Madoff's swindle by going to the early, older investors who got the money
[1:41:17.780 --> 1:41:22.780]  and say, you've got to give it back so we can give it to the later investors who got screwed over.
[1:41:22.780 --> 1:41:24.780]  But they're not doing that.
[1:41:24.780 --> 1:41:26.780]  They're going to let those people keep the money.
[1:41:26.780 --> 1:41:29.780]  Where are they going to make up the losses? A federal bailout.
[1:41:29.780 --> 1:41:35.780]  Who's going to pay for the federal bailout? You and I and the baker and the policeman and the cook and the carpenter.
[1:41:35.780 --> 1:41:37.780]  We're all going to get stuck with the bill again.
[1:41:37.780 --> 1:41:44.780]  That in a nutshell proves that the system is set up to simply loot the people for the benefit of an elite few.
[1:41:44.780 --> 1:41:50.780]  We had the head of the IMF the other day coming out saying, you know, we might not want to push them so hard for much longer
[1:41:50.780 --> 1:41:52.780]  or it is going to blow up in our faces.
[1:41:52.780 --> 1:41:59.780]  He's predicting violence and civil war in many countries, including the United States.
[1:41:59.780 --> 1:42:02.780]  Well, absolutely. But we go back to eight weeks ago and they said,
[1:42:02.780 --> 1:42:08.780]  if you don't give us this unlimited power to take over your entire government and act in secret and steal any amount of money we want,
[1:42:08.780 --> 1:42:10.780]  then you will have a depression.
[1:42:10.780 --> 1:42:14.780]  That signaled the final destruction of confidence. The public still believed their masters.
[1:42:14.780 --> 1:42:18.780]  I mean, the global social engineers knew that was going to destroy confidence,
[1:42:18.780 --> 1:42:22.780]  just as they destroyed confidence by design in 29 to consolidate.
[1:42:22.780 --> 1:42:26.780]  So what we're dealing with is just absolute complete madmen here.
[1:42:26.780 --> 1:42:28.780]  Yeah, I would agree with you on that.
[1:42:28.780 --> 1:42:31.780]  And part of it is, you know, along with self-serving agendas,
[1:42:31.780 --> 1:42:34.780]  there is a great deal of arrogance on display here.
[1:42:34.780 --> 1:42:37.780]  These people believe to the bottom of their heart that they cannot fail.
[1:42:37.780 --> 1:42:42.780]  Either the gods love them or they just think they're that much smarter than everybody else.
[1:42:42.780 --> 1:42:46.780]  And you know something? Every leader in history who fell made the same mistake,
[1:42:46.780 --> 1:42:52.780]  whether it was Louis XVI or Charles I or Chachescu or Mussolini or Hitler,
[1:42:52.780 --> 1:42:57.780]  they all thought they were just perfect and they couldn't possibly fail and they failed anyway.
[1:42:57.780 --> 1:43:01.780]  And I think that's what we're going to be seeing with the government of the United States.
[1:43:01.780 --> 1:43:06.780]  Mike, I tell you what I see happening in all of this is I see more staged terror attacks
[1:43:06.780 --> 1:43:08.780]  as a lot of the think tanks have said.
[1:43:08.780 --> 1:43:12.780]  People are wise for the fact that the Bush controllers were staging terror.
[1:43:12.780 --> 1:43:17.780]  And so what they're going to do now is that they have a new horse, Obama,
[1:43:17.780 --> 1:43:21.780]  a new front guy that the public hasn't gotten completely wise to yet, though they're starting to,
[1:43:21.780 --> 1:43:26.780]  and that they will stage terror attacks to get everybody to rally around the flag
[1:43:26.780 --> 1:43:31.780]  during the crisis so that we unify around fake environmentalism and the fake crisis
[1:43:31.780 --> 1:43:36.780]  and around fake terror as the head of the Council on Foreign Relations, Richard N. Haas,
[1:43:36.780 --> 1:43:41.780]  set in reports back in 1991 and then again last year, they said we will use fake environmentalism
[1:43:41.780 --> 1:43:45.780]  and fake terror as a unifying effect.
[1:43:45.780 --> 1:43:51.780]  Well, I think the fake environmentalism is falling flat on its face because these storms that have hit across America
[1:43:51.780 --> 1:43:55.780]  and these record cold temperatures for the second year in a row,
[1:43:55.780 --> 1:43:58.780]  people are beginning to realize that the whole global warming cult,
[1:43:58.780 --> 1:44:04.780]  it really was just a huge scam to extract more money from us, to exert more control over our lives,
[1:44:04.780 --> 1:44:07.780]  to convince us to make do with less so the government could have more,
[1:44:07.780 --> 1:44:09.780]  and the people are fed up.
[1:44:09.780 --> 1:44:13.780]  They don't see why they should go on working their guts out for very long hours a day
[1:44:13.780 --> 1:44:18.780]  just to all give to a bunch of people who are so rich they can't even remember how many homes they own.
[1:44:18.780 --> 1:44:22.780]  And I think people are fed up and they're angry and they're saying there's no end to it.
[1:44:22.780 --> 1:44:25.780]  There is no amount of work we can do that will make sure the people are mad.
[1:44:25.780 --> 1:44:28.780]  They're fed up, you know, hundreds of new taxes everywhere,
[1:44:28.780 --> 1:44:31.780]  but the establishment is signaling that they don't care.
[1:44:31.780 --> 1:44:33.780]  They are just going to continue.
[1:44:33.780 --> 1:44:37.780]  So this is like two freight trains on the same track going straight up against each other.
[1:44:37.780 --> 1:44:38.780]  Let's go to some phone calls.
[1:44:38.780 --> 1:44:42.780]  Kevin in Mass, you are on the air, Kevin.
[1:44:42.780 --> 1:44:43.780]  Hello.
[1:44:43.780 --> 1:44:44.780]  Hello, sir.
[1:44:44.780 --> 1:44:45.780]  Welcome.
[1:44:45.780 --> 1:44:46.780]  Hi, Alex.
[1:44:46.780 --> 1:44:47.780]  How are you?
[1:44:47.780 --> 1:44:48.780]  Good.
[1:44:48.780 --> 1:44:49.780]  I've talked with you before.
[1:44:49.780 --> 1:44:52.780]  I remember I mentioned to you that the Lisbon Treaty was being voted on in Ireland.
[1:44:52.780 --> 1:44:54.780]  You jumped right on that.
[1:44:54.780 --> 1:44:56.780]  And I'm a connected dots guy like you.
[1:44:56.780 --> 1:45:03.780]  And I noticed I've been listening to you recently and you're talking about federal military forces being used against the American people.
[1:45:03.780 --> 1:45:05.780]  Well, I'm going to share this with you.
[1:45:05.780 --> 1:45:08.780]  If you haven't, if you've seen this and you don't want to hear it again, just go ahead and stop me.
[1:45:08.780 --> 1:45:15.780]  But I was reading 2005 at the Navy Times, which is a counterpart of the Army Times.
[1:45:15.780 --> 1:45:18.780]  And it says, Navy will establish Navy Infantry Battalion.
[1:45:18.780 --> 1:45:20.780]  And I said, this makes absolutely no sense.
[1:45:20.780 --> 1:45:23.780]  The U.S. Marine Corps of 200,000 men is there.
[1:45:23.780 --> 1:45:26.780]  Why does the Navy need a force of about 800 men to be infantry?
[1:45:26.780 --> 1:45:29.780]  Now, put that away, 2005.
[1:45:29.780 --> 1:45:31.780]  I was doing some research over the summer.
[1:45:31.780 --> 1:45:32.780]  Now, that's the seed group.
[1:45:32.780 --> 1:45:33.780]  I did see that.
[1:45:33.780 --> 1:45:44.780]  That's what they say in the new North Come operation, that even the Coast Guard, every branch of the Armed Services will provide tens of thousands of troops.
[1:45:44.780 --> 1:45:46.780]  And of course, that 800 was the seed group.
[1:45:46.780 --> 1:45:48.780]  You got it, Alec.
[1:45:48.780 --> 1:45:59.780]  And Iraq and Afghanistan and Serbia have been the training ground for these forces in kicking down doors, gun confiscations, running checkpoints to come back to the U.S.
[1:45:59.780 --> 1:46:03.780]  Now, to acclimate the public, they're putting Marines and Army out at DWI checkpoints.
[1:46:03.780 --> 1:46:04.780]  Okay, you got it, Alec.
[1:46:04.780 --> 1:46:05.780]  Let me read this.
[1:46:05.780 --> 1:46:06.780]  I downloaded an article.
[1:46:06.780 --> 1:46:07.780]  I was doing research.
[1:46:07.780 --> 1:46:09.780]  It comes from the strategy page, which is a British website.
[1:46:09.780 --> 1:46:12.780]  And it was an article titled, American Naval Infantry Go to War.
[1:46:12.780 --> 1:46:16.780]  The article was from 2007, two years after 2005.
[1:46:16.780 --> 1:46:18.780]  Let me read you a paragraph for its brief.
[1:46:18.780 --> 1:46:21.780]  The Navy officially established its, quote,
[1:46:21.780 --> 1:46:25.780]  Naval Expeditionary Combat Command, unquote, in 2005.
[1:46:25.780 --> 1:46:31.780]  The organization will eventually grow to contain 40,000 sailors.
[1:46:31.780 --> 1:46:34.780]  All of whom will be trained to work and fight on land.
[1:46:34.780 --> 1:46:35.780]  How do you like that?
[1:46:35.780 --> 1:46:41.780]  Now, the Marine Corps has, like, regular and reserve, 12 infantry regiments.
[1:46:41.780 --> 1:46:43.780]  That's 36 battalions.
[1:46:43.780 --> 1:46:48.780]  Well, there's another 40 battalions right there, because a battalion is about 800 to 1,000 men.
[1:46:48.780 --> 1:46:52.780]  So that's 10% of naval manpower is going to be converted to infantry.
[1:46:52.780 --> 1:46:53.780]  Where are they going to be used?
[1:46:53.780 --> 1:46:56.780]  And that's a rhetorical question.
[1:46:56.780 --> 1:46:57.780]  Absolutely.
[1:46:57.780 --> 1:46:58.780]  Do me a favor.
[1:46:58.780 --> 1:46:59.780]  I didn't see those two particular articles.
[1:46:59.780 --> 1:47:05.780]  I remember seeing other blurbs in the press as they prepared the entire four branches of the military for domestic operations.
[1:47:05.780 --> 1:47:07.780]  And again, we were right about it now.
[1:47:07.780 --> 1:47:08.780]  It's public.
[1:47:08.780 --> 1:47:13.780]  Email those to Aaron at infowars.com, email those to Paul Watson over at prisonplanet.com.
[1:47:13.780 --> 1:47:18.780]  You can see the email link there, so we can get another report out on that subject as well.
[1:47:18.780 --> 1:47:20.780]  Thank you so much for the call.
[1:47:20.780 --> 1:47:24.780]  Mike Rivera, comments on what Kevin and Mass was just saying.
[1:47:24.780 --> 1:47:31.780]  Well, it is part of a pattern of acclimating the American people to military being present on the streets.
[1:47:31.780 --> 1:47:41.780]  It is a complete violation of Posse Comitatis and goes all the way back to the Declaration of Independence and the complaints about King George of Britain,
[1:47:41.780 --> 1:47:44.780]  keeping troops quartered with us to keep an eye on us.
[1:47:44.780 --> 1:47:48.780]  And again, it's part of the message that the government is sending.
[1:47:48.780 --> 1:47:49.780]  The government isn't worried about terrorists.
[1:47:49.780 --> 1:47:51.780]  They're worried about us.
[1:47:51.780 --> 1:47:57.780]  They're worried that the American people have really reached the point of just being totally fed up,
[1:47:57.780 --> 1:48:02.780]  working our entire lives away, and seeing the fruits of that labor continually drawn off
[1:48:02.780 --> 1:48:09.780]  and sucked out of our lives and given to people who've really already got much more money than they could ever possibly spend in a state like that.
[1:48:09.780 --> 1:48:10.780]  Well, they're control freaks.
[1:48:10.780 --> 1:48:11.780]  It's the great game.
[1:48:11.780 --> 1:48:12.780]  I agree with you.
[1:48:12.780 --> 1:48:18.780]  What's going to happen, though, when cops, mothers, and fathers, and children, and neighbors are losing their houses,
[1:48:18.780 --> 1:48:20.780]  where they know their country's been destroyed?
[1:48:20.780 --> 1:48:25.780]  I mean, are they just going to continue to happily gun down Americans in the riots or take people to FEMA camps?
[1:48:25.780 --> 1:48:29.780]  I mean, I don't see our police in military, especially because we've been out there for decades,
[1:48:29.780 --> 1:48:32.780]  warning them beforehand, and so now they know the truth.
[1:48:32.780 --> 1:48:34.780]  I don't see them going along with this.
[1:48:34.780 --> 1:48:37.780]  You know, I think there's probably, we're going to see foreign troops being brought in,
[1:48:37.780 --> 1:48:40.780]  which, of course, was Charles the first big mistake.
[1:48:40.780 --> 1:48:44.780]  And we're going to see foreign troops brought into the U.S. to quell disorder.
[1:48:44.780 --> 1:48:47.780]  It may be done under the aegis of the United Nations.
[1:48:47.780 --> 1:48:52.780]  But yeah, if you go back to the combat arms survey that they did at 29 pounds some years back,
[1:48:52.780 --> 1:48:56.780]  the reality is most American soldiers will not fire on American citizens.
[1:48:56.780 --> 1:49:01.780]  But they have sifted through the ranks for decades to find those cadres that will,
[1:49:01.780 --> 1:49:04.780]  and they're now in command, so that is the problem.
[1:49:04.780 --> 1:49:09.780]  Sure, 77%, 76% in all the studies won't shoot at Americans.
[1:49:09.780 --> 1:49:24.780]  Well, they just take that 25% and then create brigades of those thugs.
[1:49:39.780 --> 1:49:44.780]  And germs can't mutate to be resistant like they can to modern-day antibiotics.
[1:49:44.780 --> 1:49:49.780]  Utopia Silver has a broad range of health supplements, including colloidal silver, gold and copper,
[1:49:49.780 --> 1:49:52.780]  with a money-back guarantee on the colloidal products we produce.
[1:49:52.780 --> 1:49:56.780]  For four years, Utopia Silver has been fighting in the Texas courts against agencies
[1:49:56.780 --> 1:50:00.780]  that would steal our God-given rights of health care and freedom of speech.

[1:50:34.780 --> 1:50:46.780]  7 years after the attacks of September 11, a global awakening has taken place.
[1:50:46.780 --> 1:50:50.780]  An inside job? How dare you?
[1:50:50.780 --> 1:50:56.780]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[1:50:56.780 --> 1:51:06.780]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[1:51:06.780 --> 1:51:11.780]  Download the film at prisonplanet.tv right now or get the DVD at infowars.com.
[1:51:11.780 --> 1:51:27.780]  We'll be right back.
[1:51:41.780 --> 1:52:07.780]  We'll be right back.
[1:52:07.780 --> 1:52:17.780]  Call 1-800-340-7091 for all your cleaning needs.
[1:52:17.780 --> 1:52:22.780]  We know the private central banks of the world have staged this event to bring in world government.
[1:52:22.780 --> 1:52:27.780]  But if you really analyze it, they let in so many brokerage firms, so many other banks,
[1:52:27.780 --> 1:52:30.780]  they let so many other family members and cronies in.
[1:52:30.780 --> 1:52:39.780]  This superclass, as Rothkopf calls it, setting up world government, the 6,000 people that make up these parasites,
[1:52:39.780 --> 1:52:46.780]  that they have infected everything with bad paper and so that it threatens, as the Financial Times of London
[1:52:46.780 --> 1:52:50.780]  said a few years ago, to even consume them now.
[1:52:50.780 --> 1:52:52.780]  So this whole thing is out of control.
[1:52:52.780 --> 1:52:56.780]  We need the people to stand up and say no to the police and military.
[1:52:56.780 --> 1:52:59.780]  Don't be with people like Madoff.
[1:52:59.780 --> 1:53:03.780]  I mean, that's who's the type of folks that are running all of this.
[1:53:03.780 --> 1:53:05.780]  Don't be part of this criminal group.
[1:53:05.780 --> 1:53:08.780]  Stand with the people or it's only going to get worse for everybody.
[1:53:08.780 --> 1:53:11.780]  The elite are just destroying themselves.
[1:53:11.780 --> 1:53:15.780]  Let's go ahead and take a call from Richard in Texas.
[1:53:15.780 --> 1:53:17.780]  You're on the air with Mike Rivera.
[1:53:17.780 --> 1:53:18.780]  Go ahead.
[1:53:18.780 --> 1:53:20.780]  Hey, Alex and Mike.
[1:53:20.780 --> 1:53:25.780]  Just to cover a few things that you guys were talking about before about why they announced the new order,
[1:53:25.780 --> 1:53:29.780]  I kind of see it as a litmus, like they kind of just throw it out there to see what the reaction is
[1:53:29.780 --> 1:53:35.780]  and it gives them kind of something to either pull back or continue on with their plan.
[1:53:35.780 --> 1:53:37.780]  Yes, a trial balloon.
[1:53:37.780 --> 1:53:38.780]  Yes.
[1:53:38.780 --> 1:53:45.780]  Also, I think one of the ways that we could work this out is to go local and avoid globally like purchasing things
[1:53:45.780 --> 1:53:48.780]  that are made in China and things like that, obviously.
[1:53:48.780 --> 1:53:53.780]  Well, watch the police and the military doing this, get toys from the citizens, give it to poor kids.
[1:53:53.780 --> 1:53:55.780]  The poor kids don't need toys.
[1:53:55.780 --> 1:53:59.780]  They need their bill of rights, their constitution, a chance at a future and not a bankrupt third world country.
[1:53:59.780 --> 1:54:03.780]  So, you know, Mike Rivera, your comments on that.
[1:54:03.780 --> 1:54:04.780]  Yeah, absolutely.
[1:54:04.780 --> 1:54:06.780]  These stories are a trial balloon.
[1:54:06.780 --> 1:54:12.780]  They're trying to see if the frog has been boiled enough yet and they're trying to like just lure us in.
[1:54:12.780 --> 1:54:17.780]  As you said earlier in the show, this is all about trying to sell us on the need for a global world government,
[1:54:17.780 --> 1:54:21.780]  even though it's globalism that has really brought us to the edge of disaster.
[1:54:21.780 --> 1:54:22.780]  Absolutely.
[1:54:22.780 --> 1:54:23.780]  Thanks, Richard.
[1:54:23.780 --> 1:54:29.780]  I just wanted to mention this special that I saw on PBS last night on the 401k plan.
[1:54:29.780 --> 1:54:33.780]  It was actually last night and the demise of the pension plan.
[1:54:33.780 --> 1:54:40.780]  They mentioned that under a pension plan, employers paid 89% and employees paid 11%.
[1:54:40.780 --> 1:54:48.780]  Now, under 401k, it's 5049 and employees paid 50% or 51%, rather, and employers paid 49%.
[1:54:48.780 --> 1:54:52.780]  So, I think that's another thing to look at as far as the agenda that was created.
[1:54:52.780 --> 1:55:01.780]  I think in 1974, when all this took over and now pension plan, 401k, I mean, you're left with absolutely nothing.
[1:55:01.780 --> 1:55:04.780]  It's basically a base check that you get after your...
[1:55:04.780 --> 1:55:12.780]  And to save it, they're saying that they are going to have the government take over even private pension funds
[1:55:12.780 --> 1:55:14.780]  and then tax it to administer it.
[1:55:14.780 --> 1:55:16.780]  So, absolutely great points.
[1:55:16.780 --> 1:55:17.780]  Let's take another call here.
[1:55:17.780 --> 1:55:19.780]  Let's talk to Adam in Missouri.
[1:55:19.780 --> 1:55:20.780]  Go ahead, Adam.
[1:55:20.780 --> 1:55:21.780]  You're on the air.
[1:55:21.780 --> 1:55:22.780]  Hey, how's it going, Alex?
[1:55:22.780 --> 1:55:24.780]  Well, I guess okay.
[1:55:24.780 --> 1:55:26.780]  I'd have to disagree with the mayor.
[1:55:26.780 --> 1:55:33.780]  I definitely think U.S. troops are going to fire on the population here, especially after a couple of shots come their way.
[1:55:33.780 --> 1:55:37.780]  Well, then the public's going to burn everything down, which is going to be a really bad situation.
[1:55:37.780 --> 1:55:38.780]  Oh, yeah.
[1:55:38.780 --> 1:55:41.780]  It's going to be terrible and that's why, you know...
[1:55:41.780 --> 1:55:45.780]  Well, they think we're wimps, but the American people have just been restrained.
[1:55:45.780 --> 1:55:48.780]  And once the genie's out of the bottle, it is going to be an inferno.
[1:55:48.780 --> 1:55:49.780]  Mike Rivera?
[1:55:49.780 --> 1:55:50.780]  Well, yeah.
[1:55:50.780 --> 1:55:55.780]  I go back to what Admiral Yamamoto said about Americans following the bombing of Pearl Harbor.
[1:55:55.780 --> 1:55:58.780]  I fear we have awoken a sleeping giant.
[1:55:58.780 --> 1:56:01.780]  That's exactly right, because Americans are traditionally...
[1:56:01.780 --> 1:56:06.780]  They're very slow to anger, but once they're angry, it's impossible to stop them.
[1:56:06.780 --> 1:56:09.780]  Well, I want everybody knowing the CPS that's kidnapped all these kids
[1:56:09.780 --> 1:56:12.780]  and dying Corrin Halliburton with the white slavery rings.
[1:56:12.780 --> 1:56:14.780]  You may think you can move to Dubai with no extradition.
[1:56:14.780 --> 1:56:17.780]  We are going to come get you.
[1:56:17.780 --> 1:56:18.780]  Absolutely.
[1:56:18.780 --> 1:56:21.780]  Those of us that make it through this, go ahead, Adam, finish up.
[1:56:21.780 --> 1:56:22.780]  Yes.
[1:56:22.780 --> 1:56:28.780]  You know, the war is coming and I believe very strongly that we are going to win this fight,
[1:56:28.780 --> 1:56:31.780]  but the war isn't the hard part.
[1:56:31.780 --> 1:56:36.780]  It's the rebuilding afterwards that's going to be the difficult part.
[1:56:36.780 --> 1:56:44.780]  I'm wondering, do you think we have the leaders and just the intelligence power to pull this off,
[1:56:44.780 --> 1:56:46.780]  so the same thing just doesn't happen again?
[1:56:46.780 --> 1:56:49.780]  Well, that's the $64 million question.
[1:56:49.780 --> 1:56:53.780]  Many times, these French revolutions get even worse than what we had previously.
[1:56:53.780 --> 1:56:58.780]  You are listening to GCN.
[1:56:58.780 --> 1:57:04.780]  Visit GCNLive.com today.
[1:57:04.780 --> 1:57:07.780]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history,
[1:57:07.780 --> 1:57:11.780]  a terrorist act of war against this country.
[1:57:11.780 --> 1:57:13.780]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[1:57:13.780 --> 1:57:15.780]  But who is the enemy?
[1:57:15.780 --> 1:57:16.780]  Bin Laden.
[1:57:16.780 --> 1:57:17.780]  This is his MO.
[1:57:17.780 --> 1:57:18.780]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[1:57:18.780 --> 1:57:20.780]  We have to look to the Song of Bin Laden.
[1:57:20.780 --> 1:57:27.780]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[1:57:27.780 --> 1:57:34.780]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[1:57:34.780 --> 1:57:38.780]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[1:57:38.780 --> 1:57:43.780]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers' ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection,
[1:57:43.780 --> 1:57:48.780]  the Israeli intelligence network, warnings in war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[1:57:48.780 --> 1:57:52.780]  Fabled Enemies, get the DVD at infowars.com.
[1:57:52.780 --> 1:57:57.780]  Or see it in super high quality, along with hundreds of other titles at prisonplanet.tv.
[1:57:57.780 --> 1:58:19.780]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[1:58:27.780 --> 1:58:33.780]  Live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[1:58:58.780 --> 1:59:03.780]  Just as bad or worse, and so as Ron Paul has said, out of all of this crisis,
[1:59:03.780 --> 1:59:07.780]  we need to make sure that we go back to the Bill of Rights Constitution Declaration of Independence,
[1:59:07.780 --> 1:59:10.780]  and not into some new tyranny where another faction of the elite,
[1:59:10.780 --> 1:59:16.780]  six the working class, the middle class, on the other faction of the elite,
[1:59:16.780 --> 1:59:19.780]  or the underlings of the elite overthrow their bosses,
[1:59:19.780 --> 1:59:23.780]  and then act like we've had a revolution, and then bring in a new form of tyranny.
[1:59:23.780 --> 1:59:30.780]  The euphoria that comes after a revolution is always a very dangerous time in the formation of the new system.
[1:59:30.780 --> 1:59:32.780]  I absolutely agree with you, and I agree with Ron Paul.
[1:59:32.780 --> 1:59:37.780]  We need to go back to the original founding principles of this country, as enshrined in the Constitution.
[1:59:37.780 --> 1:59:41.780]  When people talk about the French Revolution, what they don't understand is,
[1:59:41.780 --> 1:59:44.780]  there were actually about eight of them, as each new group came to power
[1:59:44.780 --> 1:59:47.780]  and proved that they were just as corrupt as the last one.
[1:59:47.780 --> 1:59:50.780]  They'd get out the Tumbles and the guillotines all over again.
[1:59:50.780 --> 1:59:53.780]  They've got different regions battled with each other.
[1:59:53.780 --> 1:59:56.780]  Yeah, absolutely. Everybody wanted control.
[1:59:56.780 --> 2:00:01.780]  Remember, when we throw the old scoundrels out, there's going to be a long line of new scoundrels trying to get in,
[2:00:01.780 --> 2:00:05.780]  and we have to keep an eye out for them.
[2:00:05.780 --> 2:00:10.780]  Absolutely. Let's take another call here for you. Let's talk to Dragon in Jersey.
[2:00:10.780 --> 2:00:12.780]  Go ahead, Dragon.
[2:00:12.780 --> 2:00:19.780]  Dragon dropped. Let's talk to Linda in Florida. Linda, you're on the air.
[2:00:19.780 --> 2:00:21.780]  Yes, Linda. You're on the air.
[2:00:21.780 --> 2:00:30.780]  Yes. I thank you for your work. I last talked to you down here in Orlando on your radio look.
[2:00:30.780 --> 2:00:36.780]  I agree with the comment that was made, but I disagree with the assessment that you guys made of it.
[2:00:36.780 --> 2:00:40.780]  We cannot win this war without unity.
[2:00:40.780 --> 2:00:46.780]  If we are not organized and united, we are not only vulnerable individually,
[2:00:46.780 --> 2:00:55.780]  but our cause is reduced to chaotic survival, or instead of an orderly resistance in advance.
[2:00:55.780 --> 2:01:00.780]  Well, ma'am, that knife cuts both ways. If you only have one group leading, it can be overthrown, infiltrated.
[2:01:00.780 --> 2:01:02.780]  The leaders can be killed and imprisoned.
[2:01:02.780 --> 2:01:10.780]  When you have a spirit of liberty, sons of liberty, an idea and the push to bring those that engineered this to justice
[2:01:10.780 --> 2:01:16.780]  and then to go back to the Bill of Rights and Constitution, then that doesn't happen.
[2:01:16.780 --> 2:01:19.780]  All I ever hear our, quote, movement doing is saying, I'm the leader. I'm the leader.
[2:01:19.780 --> 2:01:22.780]  Whereas I've always had success, because I haven't tried to be a leader.
[2:01:22.780 --> 2:01:26.780]  I've tried to educate and wake as many people up as I can. Mike Rivera.
[2:01:26.780 --> 2:01:32.780]  Yes, absolutely. The key to all of this is we're changing the way the information flows through society
[2:01:32.780 --> 2:01:36.780]  so that it's not under the control of the government and the elite anymore.
[2:01:36.780 --> 2:01:42.780]  And that really is a major part of it, because that's why the American people are realizing what's being done to them now.
[2:01:42.780 --> 2:01:46.780]  We didn't go out and force it down their throats. We just make it available.
[2:01:46.780 --> 2:01:50.780]  People naturally want the truth. They're going to go to where they can find the truth.
[2:01:50.780 --> 2:01:56.780]  And that's why the newspapers and TV networks are in trouble, and the blogs and the alternative media are doing quite well right now.
[2:01:56.780 --> 2:02:02.780]  And that's why the system is coming to try to shut down the web now with this Internet too, with Barack Obama.
[2:02:02.780 --> 2:02:06.780]  And again, all these years we've been here exposing them and fighting them.
[2:02:06.780 --> 2:02:10.780]  So when they made their move for world government, everybody would see who they were.
[2:02:10.780 --> 2:02:15.780]  Now all the hard work and the apple seeds, all of you planted, are now spraying the life. Mike.
[2:02:15.780 --> 2:02:19.780]  Yes, it is. It is a time of tremendous change in the long run.
[2:02:19.780 --> 2:02:26.780]  I don't think it's going to be possible to control the Internet any more than it was possible to control books once Gutenberg invented movable type printing.
[2:02:26.780 --> 2:02:30.780]  I think it is that irreversible. I know they're going to try.
[2:02:30.780 --> 2:02:33.780]  I don't think they can succeed in the long run. I don't think they can.
[2:02:33.780 --> 2:02:37.780]  Absolutely. And Linda, I hate to cut you off, but we've got another guest coming up. You can call me back tomorrow if you'd like.
[2:02:37.780 --> 2:02:40.780]  When I've got open phones, we can have a larger discussion.
[2:02:40.780 --> 2:02:47.780]  And next week I do have some days where there's not a lot of guests on, so we can open the phones up and take hour after hour of calls and hear from everybody out there.
[2:02:47.780 --> 2:02:50.780]  Thank you, Linda. Everybody else, your calls are coming up with Alan Watt.
[2:02:50.780 --> 2:02:54.780]  Mike Rivera, I want to thank you for joining us. It's always great to have you on.
[2:02:54.780 --> 2:02:56.780]  Oh, thank you. I'll be back next month.
[2:02:56.780 --> 2:02:57.780]  Have a great Christmas.
[2:02:57.780 --> 2:02:58.780]  Same to you.
[2:02:58.780 --> 2:03:01.780]  He'll be back early next month. Okay, we'll be back after this quick break.
[2:03:01.780 --> 2:03:08.780]  Remember, today's the last day to order DVDs and books at infowars.com and be sure to get them before Christmas.
[2:03:08.780 --> 2:03:29.780]  So get those orders in. We'll be right back.
[2:03:39.780 --> 2:03:41.780]  $850 billion at least out of thin air.
[2:03:41.780 --> 2:03:44.780]  This money now owns the American and European banks.
[2:03:44.780 --> 2:03:53.780]  The exploding inflation that is now guaranteed will slash your life savings to nothing and blast the cost of necessities, particularly food beyond many Americans reach.
[2:03:53.780 --> 2:04:00.780]  In pre-Nazi Germany's superinflation, the cost of a loaf of bread doubled every two days until it reached over 4 billion marks.
[2:04:00.780 --> 2:04:10.780]  Food prices are skyrocketing so fast, there seems as if there may be no end in sight. The private banks merging with our government are refusing to loan grocery stores enough money to restock their shelves.
[2:04:10.780 --> 2:04:17.780]  The stores have less food, but jack of prices to stay in business. Whatever happens in America, we need to be prepared and be ready.
[2:04:17.780 --> 2:04:23.780]  Everything is zeroing in on food. One third of Americans have to choose between buying food and paying for other necessities.
[2:04:23.780 --> 2:04:35.780]  My friends, whatever it takes, get prepared, get self-sufficient, get food. For everybody out there listening, it's very important for you to understand that by having a supply of storable food, the government, the new old order has a lot less control over you.
[2:04:35.780 --> 2:04:42.780]  And so it's a mindset, a mindset of self-sufficiency and preparedness. No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[2:04:42.780 --> 2:04:52.780]  You know, eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports, and they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[2:04:52.780 --> 2:05:03.780]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or on the web, go to eFoodsDirect.com. Visit eFoodsDirect.com and look over the final list of high quality, freeze-dried, and dehydrated foods they have to offer.
[2:05:03.780 --> 2:05:19.780]  Watch the free videos, look at their online catalog, or give them a call at 1-800-409-5633. Again, 800-409-5633 or on the web at eFoodsDirect.com. Take action today. The first step is getting storable food.
[2:05:19.780 --> 2:05:29.780]  I don't have to tell you things are bad. Everybody knows things are bad. It's a depression. Everybody's out of work or scared of losing their job.
[2:05:29.780 --> 2:05:40.780]  The dollar buys a nickel's worth. Banks are going bust, shopkeepers keep a gun under the counter. Punks are running wild in the street and there's nobody anywhere who seems to know what to do and there's no end to it.
[2:05:40.780 --> 2:05:54.780]  We know the air is unfit to breathe. Our food is unfit to eat. We sit watching our TVs while some local newscaster tells us that today we had 15 homeless eyes of 63 violent crimes, as if that's the way it's supposed to be.
[2:05:54.780 --> 2:06:01.780]  We know things are bad, worse than bad. They're crazy. It's like everything everywhere is going crazy so we don't go out anymore.
[2:06:01.780 --> 2:06:08.780]  We sit in the house and slowly the world we're living in is getting smaller and all we say is please at least leave us alone in our living rooms.
[2:06:08.780 --> 2:06:14.780]  Let me have my toaster and my TV and my steel-built and radios and I won't say anything. Just leave us alone.
[2:06:14.780 --> 2:06:18.780]  Well, I'm not going to leave you alone. I want you to get mad.
[2:06:18.780 --> 2:06:24.780]  I don't want you to protest. I don't want you to ride. I don't want you to write to your congressman because I wouldn't know what to tell you to write.
[2:06:24.780 --> 2:06:31.780]  I don't know what to do about the depression and the inflation and the Russians and the crime in the street. All I know is that first you've got to get mad.
[2:06:31.780 --> 2:06:36.780]  You've got to say I'm a human being. My life has value.
[2:06:36.780 --> 2:06:43.780]  I want you to get up now. I want all of you to get up out of your chairs.
[2:06:43.780 --> 2:06:50.780]  I want you to get up right now. Go to the window. Open it. Sit your head out and yell.
[2:06:50.780 --> 2:06:55.780]  I'm as mad as hell and I'm not going to take this anymore.
[2:06:55.780 --> 2:07:02.780]  We're live, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you so much for joining us. We'll be live at prisonplanet.tv.
[2:07:02.780 --> 2:07:08.780]  Streaming the prisonplanet.tv members for the next hour and 15 minutes. We'll be into the radio show.
[2:07:08.780 --> 2:07:13.780]  Alan Watt is with us for the balance of the broadcast. Today we're going to cover the news with him in the next 30 minutes.
[2:07:13.780 --> 2:07:22.780]  Then open phones for Alan Watt and, of course, myself, Alex Jones for the rest of this transmission, December 17th, 2008.
[2:07:22.780 --> 2:07:27.780]  It seems like this year just started a few days ago and now it is already almost over.
[2:07:27.780 --> 2:07:31.780]  Interest rates have been cut by zero, further destroying the dollar.
[2:07:31.780 --> 2:07:35.780]  The Federal Reserve is openly taking over the United States. 8.5 trillion stolen.
[2:07:35.780 --> 2:07:41.780]  That number is two weeks old. They're telling Congress and the media, even after four-year suits, that they will not release the information.
[2:07:41.780 --> 2:07:46.780]  Remember, they promised it would all be public. This is all by design.
[2:07:46.780 --> 2:07:53.780]  And scores of news articles and the Army War College are reporting that the military is training to attack the American people
[2:07:53.780 --> 2:07:58.780]  and rules of engagement to not just use microwave guns and sound cannons, but bullets.
[2:07:58.780 --> 2:08:01.780]  It says the American people are going to rebel against them.
[2:08:01.780 --> 2:08:08.780]  The Ministry of Defense last year in England admitted this. The Defense Department this year has admitted a new report out on prisonplanet.com.
[2:08:08.780 --> 2:08:16.780]  I want to talk to Alan Watt with known and unknown unconventional strategic shocks in defense strategy development.
[2:08:16.780 --> 2:08:20.780]  And this gets into, it says right here, their fight with the American people.
[2:08:20.780 --> 2:08:26.780]  So the question is, will the social engineers be able to bring in this worldwide depression that they engineered publicly
[2:08:26.780 --> 2:08:33.780]  and then pose as saviors and then set up openly their world government where we will pay our taxes directly to the private banking institutions?
[2:08:33.780 --> 2:08:35.780]  This is now being announced.
[2:08:35.780 --> 2:08:45.780]  I want to now go to Alan Watt of Cutting Through the Matrix. Alan Watt is a prolific researcher on the true nature of the global elite
[2:08:45.780 --> 2:08:49.780]  and their master plan from their source documents and their own agenda.
[2:08:49.780 --> 2:08:52.780]  And it is good to have Alan Watt with us today. Alan, thank you for coming on.
[2:08:52.780 --> 2:08:55.780]  That's a pleasure to be on.
[2:08:55.780 --> 2:08:59.780]  Alan, I know you're a news hound like myself because I follow your work.
[2:08:59.780 --> 2:09:06.780]  And I know you've been covering the fact that hundreds of major newspapers, including the Wall Street Journal, the Financial Times of London and others
[2:09:06.780 --> 2:09:10.780]  are all reporting that yes, we had a secret world government.
[2:09:10.780 --> 2:09:12.780]  Yes, we set up a secret world government.
[2:09:12.780 --> 2:09:15.780]  Yes, we've been soothing you and lying to you.
[2:09:15.780 --> 2:09:24.780]  They even say this for your own good in the article and now for World Government by Mr. Raykman in the Financial Times of London last Tuesday.
[2:09:24.780 --> 2:09:31.780]  They admit that it's tyrannical, anti-democratic, but they say it's for your own good to save us from global warming and terrorism,
[2:09:31.780 --> 2:09:35.780]  which we know they're staging, and the financial crisis, which we know they're implementing.
[2:09:35.780 --> 2:09:39.780]  Why are they now in hundreds of publications, hundreds?
[2:09:39.780 --> 2:09:46.780]  You can Google New World Order and Google News, thousands, around 5,400 links come up in the last few months.
[2:09:46.780 --> 2:09:49.780]  Why are they suddenly announcing it?
[2:09:49.780 --> 2:09:55.780]  Don't they understand that the people finally are seeing that it's real and that they are the authors of our doom?
[2:09:55.780 --> 2:10:04.780]  Why is New York announcing New York State 88 new taxes on food and drink and iPods and taxis?
[2:10:04.780 --> 2:10:08.780]  Why are they trying to squeeze us into conflict?
[2:10:08.780 --> 2:10:14.780]  So, A, why are they openly announcing their world government, admitting it's tyrannical, anti-democratic, social engineering?
[2:10:14.780 --> 2:10:20.780]  B, why are they pushing us with all these new taxes, knowing it will cause rebellion, as we've seen worldwide?
[2:10:20.780 --> 2:10:25.780]  What they're doing is simply implementing the next part of this plan.
[2:10:25.780 --> 2:10:33.780]  They've had years of creating what they call apathy, and they started that agenda back in the 1960s in fact.
[2:10:33.780 --> 2:10:42.780]  The creation of apathy, the idea was to entrench the people from the idea that somehow they took part in making the future,
[2:10:42.780 --> 2:10:47.780]  deciding the future, to entrench the governments from the very people themselves,
[2:10:47.780 --> 2:10:55.780]  and to encourage the people to leave it to the better people, the ones who really dealt with the higher decision making policies.
[2:10:55.780 --> 2:11:04.780]  In other words, they divided us, they cut us off from participating really in government and the creation of our future.
[2:11:04.780 --> 2:11:07.780]  They've put us off the path of creating our own destiny.
[2:11:07.780 --> 2:11:14.780]  And most people today, after a survey, after a survey that's been churned out for the last 30 years,
[2:11:14.780 --> 2:11:17.780]  keep showing that fewer and fewer people bother to even vote.
[2:11:17.780 --> 2:11:21.780]  They leave it to the higher decisions to what they call the experts.
[2:11:21.780 --> 2:11:28.780]  So, what they're doing now is putting that home to the public and creating more apathy.
[2:11:28.780 --> 2:11:32.780]  The statements really leave you with the feeling that everything's out of your hands.
[2:11:32.780 --> 2:11:37.780]  There's nothing you can do, that's the other message you get subliminally,
[2:11:37.780 --> 2:11:41.780]  and get ready for tough, tough times coming, just accept it.
[2:11:41.780 --> 2:11:45.780]  They're trying to tell you it's so overwhelming, there's nothing you can do.
[2:11:45.780 --> 2:11:50.780]  That really is the message, a psychological warfare to the extreme.
[2:11:50.780 --> 2:12:00.780]  Well, I concur with you, and in fact, as you know, they talk about in hundreds and hundreds of declassified government psychology tests,
[2:12:00.780 --> 2:12:03.780]  starting with rats and then with other primates and then humans,
[2:12:03.780 --> 2:12:09.780]  that if they just shock you with overwhelming information that it creates a feeling of hopelessness,
[2:12:09.780 --> 2:12:14.780]  and many people go into a catatonic state and attach and roll over.
[2:12:14.780 --> 2:12:18.780]  But we also have a lot of Pentagon studies going back to the 50s and then again in the 70s and 80s,
[2:12:18.780 --> 2:12:24.780]  where they studied the Western world and said within three to four days, rioting breaks out over no food.
[2:12:24.780 --> 2:12:29.780]  And within 15 days, basically everybody becomes mad killers who will kill for food.
[2:12:29.780 --> 2:12:35.780]  So it looks like they're pushing us into a crisis where they know we won't just be apathetic and will actually fight back.
[2:12:35.780 --> 2:12:39.780]  Look at Greece, look at Iceland, look at Argentina, all over the world,
[2:12:39.780 --> 2:12:45.780]  the riots now starting worldwide, we have the establishment then trying to push those riots,
[2:12:45.780 --> 2:12:50.780]  with Martin coming out today and, well, not Martin now,
[2:12:50.780 --> 2:12:54.780]  Harper coming out saying we're going to have a depression,
[2:12:54.780 --> 2:12:58.780]  with the head of the IMF saying we're going to have worldwide rioting.
[2:12:58.780 --> 2:13:02.780]  If we don't fix the economy when we know they engineered the crisis.
[2:13:02.780 --> 2:13:06.780]  So with your expertise, try to break down for us, please.
[2:13:06.780 --> 2:13:12.780]  What exactly is happening here and what this cocktail is of trying to get us to rebel and fight back,
[2:13:12.780 --> 2:13:15.780]  while at the same time trying to sue this and getting us to go along?
[2:13:15.780 --> 2:13:20.780]  Well, we have to look at first is not so much what's happening, but what's the long-term goal.
[2:13:20.780 --> 2:13:26.780]  And when they tell you they're going to have rioting for about 30 years worldwide,
[2:13:26.780 --> 2:13:30.780]  and they're telling you as well that they have to get the world to accept,
[2:13:30.780 --> 2:13:36.780]  accept the fact that rapid deployment and reaction troops will be sent all over the globe,
[2:13:36.780 --> 2:13:41.780]  from one country to the other, to each other as well.
[2:13:41.780 --> 2:13:45.780]  And you're going to see that in 30 years of psychological training,
[2:13:45.780 --> 2:13:49.780]  with riots breaking out in different countries and being quelled one at a time,
[2:13:49.780 --> 2:13:52.780]  that after 30 years we'll have a brand new society,
[2:13:52.780 --> 2:13:56.780]  where we accept that the old way is completely eradicated,
[2:13:56.780 --> 2:13:59.780]  the old way of choosing what you want to do with your life,
[2:13:59.780 --> 2:14:02.780]  where you're going to go with your life, where you want to live, where you want to marry,
[2:14:02.780 --> 2:14:07.780]  all of that stuff, you want to earn money for yourself, that's gone as well.
[2:14:07.780 --> 2:14:10.780]  It's a brand new world as it came out at the end of this whole agenda.
[2:14:10.780 --> 2:14:14.780]  So we're going to see the sporadic outbreaks in certain parts,
[2:14:14.780 --> 2:14:18.780]  until it's a standard daily news for 30 years,
[2:14:18.780 --> 2:14:24.780]  the troops have been deployed in Brazil, the troops have been deployed in the Hague,
[2:14:24.780 --> 2:14:29.780]  they'll be deployed in Norway, Finland, the US, or parts of the US,
[2:14:29.780 --> 2:14:32.780]  and that will be our standard fare for 30 years.
[2:14:32.780 --> 2:14:35.780]  And we've now seen tens of millions of years given to Mexico alone,
[2:14:35.780 --> 2:14:39.780]  to suddenly militarize and put troops in black uniforms on every street corner,
[2:14:39.780 --> 2:14:42.780]  and then start wars with the drug cartels they don't control,
[2:14:42.780 --> 2:14:50.780]  to further escalate the problem reaction solution crises that they're openly engineering.
[2:14:50.780 --> 2:14:53.780]  I'm going to put up on screen, and now for world government,
[2:14:53.780 --> 2:14:57.780]  from the financial times of London,
[2:14:57.780 --> 2:15:01.780]  I mean again, just incredibly arrogant to be throwing this in our face.
[2:15:01.780 --> 2:15:06.780]  It's arrogant too, and also when you go into the whole UN agenda,
[2:15:06.780 --> 2:15:09.780]  you can't really understand this until you look at the UN agenda,
[2:15:09.780 --> 2:15:14.780]  with all of its umbrella organizations working on the same agenda,
[2:15:14.780 --> 2:15:19.780]  to the state where eventually you will not work for yourself,
[2:15:19.780 --> 2:15:23.780]  you'll work for the world state, you'll get your food given to you by,
[2:15:23.780 --> 2:15:26.780]  or via the United Nations, that's in their charter,
[2:15:26.780 --> 2:15:30.780]  they'll be in command of all the food resources of the entire country.
[2:15:30.780 --> 2:15:34.780]  And as you mentioned, the British ministry of reference public report last year said,
[2:15:34.780 --> 2:15:39.780]  we work for the foreign banks, we're going to engineer in the US, England and Europe and Japan
[2:15:39.780 --> 2:15:44.780]  30 years of riots, and our job will be suppressing the people
[2:15:44.780 --> 2:15:47.780]  while this transformation to world government is complete.
[2:15:47.780 --> 2:15:51.780]  Yes, and so a generation will grow up through these tough times,
[2:15:51.780 --> 2:15:58.780]  and it'll be quite natural to hear on the news that the rapid deployment forces are down in California this week,
[2:15:58.780 --> 2:16:05.780]  they're quelling a riot by malcontents who are anti-social, who won't blend into the new social structure,
[2:16:05.780 --> 2:16:10.780]  and this is how the planet is really working on the minds of those growing up.
[2:16:10.780 --> 2:16:14.780]  Already we have people growing up who've never known freedom,
[2:16:14.780 --> 2:16:19.780]  they think that police in the streets and tanks going around and guys in black uniforms and subways,
[2:16:19.780 --> 2:16:23.780]  machine guns is quite natural, they're under a constant state of terror,
[2:16:23.780 --> 2:16:27.780]  that's the only world they've known, the one that will grow up through all the rioting
[2:16:27.780 --> 2:16:31.780]  will take that as standard, they will think that those who riot are anti-social
[2:16:31.780 --> 2:16:35.780]  because they want more than their fair share, that the UN is dishing out to them,
[2:16:35.780 --> 2:16:41.780]  and at the end of all of this, there'll be no memory or history of the world that was before.
[2:16:41.780 --> 2:16:43.780]  And that's what George Arwell talks about,
[2:16:43.780 --> 2:16:47.780]  who was a BBC propagandist and openly admitted before he died of tuberculosis,
[2:16:47.780 --> 2:16:54.780]  and a lot of evidence showed was killed that this is the plan he was led in on as a member of British intelligence.
[2:16:54.780 --> 2:16:59.780]  And showing that the British masterminds,
[2:16:59.780 --> 2:17:02.780]  not the British people, but the British masterminds are running this,
[2:17:02.780 --> 2:17:06.780]  everything the British government puts out as policy is then mimicked and parroted
[2:17:06.780 --> 2:17:10.780]  as official policy in the United States, Europe, Japan, and worldwide.
[2:17:10.780 --> 2:17:12.780]  Alan Watt is our guest.
[2:17:12.780 --> 2:17:15.780]  We'll talk about the public, even though the world government's being admitted,
[2:17:15.780 --> 2:17:19.780]  some of the public's still in denial saying the articles were showing are fake.
[2:17:19.780 --> 2:17:26.780]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[2:17:26.780 --> 2:17:30.780]  The enemy struck America on September 11th. But who is the enemy?
[2:17:30.780 --> 2:17:32.780]  Bin Laden. This is his MO.
[2:17:32.780 --> 2:17:35.780]  We have to look to the Middle East. We have to look to the Psalm of Bin Laden.
[2:17:35.780 --> 2:17:42.780]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[2:17:42.780 --> 2:17:49.780]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[2:17:49.780 --> 2:17:53.780]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[2:17:53.780 --> 2:17:58.780]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers' ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection,
[2:17:58.780 --> 2:18:03.780]  the Israeli intelligence network, warnings in war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[2:18:03.780 --> 2:18:07.780]  Fabled Enemies. Get the DVD at infowars.com.
[2:18:07.780 --> 2:18:12.780]  You'll never see it in super high quality, along with hundreds of other titles at prisonplanet.tv.
[2:18:12.780 --> 2:18:19.780]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[2:18:19.780 --> 2:18:25.780]  Hi, John Huber from Mitus Resources. Are you tired of watching your hard-earned assets dwindle away?
[2:18:25.780 --> 2:18:30.780]  As government spending is out of hand and the Federal Reserve is creating in excess of 20 billion a week,
[2:18:30.780 --> 2:18:33.780]  are you tired of stockbrokers gambling away your hard-earned money?
[2:18:33.780 --> 2:18:37.780]  Is this market a setup for a crash greater than 1987?
[2:18:37.780 --> 2:18:41.780]  Too many of today's policies resemble those that led to the collapse of 1929.
[2:18:41.780 --> 2:18:43.780]  How much are you willing to lose?
[2:18:43.780 --> 2:18:49.780]  Take action now. Call me at 1-800-686-2237, extension 129.
[2:18:49.780 --> 2:18:53.780]  I believe that we are facing a financial catastrophe of biblical proportion.
[2:18:53.780 --> 2:18:56.780]  Over recent decades, numerous economic systems have failed.
[2:18:56.780 --> 2:19:03.780]  Current Federal Reserve policy and uncontrolled government spending have set the stage for the United States to be the next target.
[2:19:03.780 --> 2:19:09.780]  Secure your assets today by calling 1-800-686-2237, extension 129.
[2:19:09.780 --> 2:19:11.780]  Do this while paper can still buy gold.
[2:19:11.780 --> 2:19:18.780]  Call me, John Huber, at 1-800-686-2237, extension 129.
[2:19:18.780 --> 2:19:22.780]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[2:19:22.780 --> 2:19:28.780]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[2:19:28.780 --> 2:19:33.780]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate and others are absorbed into the skin.
[2:19:33.780 --> 2:19:37.780]  The KDF dual-media shower filter works with both hot and cold water,
[2:19:37.780 --> 2:19:40.780]  and is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron,
[2:19:40.780 --> 2:19:44.780]  and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus.
[2:19:44.780 --> 2:19:50.780]  The KDF dual-media shower filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons or one year whichever comes first.
[2:19:50.780 --> 2:19:56.780]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[2:19:56.780 --> 2:20:04.780]  What about you? Order your KDF shower filter normally $49 for a special price of only $39.99 with free shipping.

[2:20:43.780 --> 2:20:50.780]  During his 25 years of medical practice, Keelorex does not contain EDTA and is made from all natural ingredients.
[2:20:50.780 --> 2:20:55.780]  Enhancing the body's natural mechanisms for excreting heavy metals and preventing their reabsorption,
[2:20:55.780 --> 2:21:00.780]  Keelorex contains antioxidants to protect the liver, kidneys, central nervous system, and immune functions,
[2:21:00.780 --> 2:21:06.780]  and effectively mobilizes mercury and 15 other heavy metals including aluminum, arsenic, lead, and more.

[2:21:27.780 --> 2:21:32.780]  They're doing a bad, bad thing right now, ladies and gentlemen.
[2:21:32.780 --> 2:21:41.780]  All right, Alan Watt. That's what I'd call an independent sociologist studying all of this.
[2:21:41.780 --> 2:21:45.780]  Or you can define yourself in the, I guess, the work I do.
[2:21:45.780 --> 2:21:50.780]  I mean, I guess a real historian studying the elite and their program for humanity.
[2:21:50.780 --> 2:21:54.780]  You have these hundreds of articles saying, world government's here, world government's a good idea.
[2:21:54.780 --> 2:21:59.780]  We're going to put one back on screen admitting it's tyrannical, but saying it's for your own good.
[2:21:59.780 --> 2:22:03.780]  That's just more of this terrorism, stage terror attacks, stage financial attacks.
[2:22:03.780 --> 2:22:06.780]  Give us total power or the economy will implode.
[2:22:06.780 --> 2:22:09.780]  The Congress gives them total power under threat of martial law.
[2:22:09.780 --> 2:22:14.780]  The British parliament's being spied on. Governors are being arrested, all this fear.
[2:22:14.780 --> 2:22:19.780]  And then even though hundreds of papers and world leaders are all over TV calling for world government,
[2:22:19.780 --> 2:22:25.780]  I still get emails and comments and talk show hosts and Rush Limbaugh making fun of myself even by name
[2:22:25.780 --> 2:22:32.780]  saying that none of it exists. So all these years we read the documents, the CFR reports, Carol Quigley,
[2:22:32.780 --> 2:22:37.780]  literally thousands and thousands of them on air, wrote books about it, made films about it.
[2:22:37.780 --> 2:22:44.780]  Now that it's all happening and emerging publicly, a lot of people are waking up and saying,
[2:22:44.780 --> 2:22:46.780]  oh my God, you were right. We've got to fight this.
[2:22:46.780 --> 2:22:53.780]  But just as many, I'd say 20, 30% of the public are saying, you know what, they told me previously this didn't exist.
[2:22:53.780 --> 2:22:57.780]  So I'm saying you're a liar. I'm saying these news articles are fake.
[2:22:57.780 --> 2:23:01.780]  I'm saying none of this is real. And I'm seeing a huge backlash.
[2:23:01.780 --> 2:23:04.780]  And I know some of them are operatives and paid bloggers.
[2:23:04.780 --> 2:23:10.780]  But I mean, it just seems like such an insult to the public's intelligence to openly admit it.
[2:23:10.780 --> 2:23:14.780]  And then with the other hand, as this Raikman guy did a day after he wrote the article,
[2:23:14.780 --> 2:23:17.780]  he wrote another article saying there is no world government, your conspiracy theorist.
[2:23:17.780 --> 2:23:19.780]  So can you speak to that?
[2:23:19.780 --> 2:23:27.780]  That, again, is the limbo on these characters, really, their job is to keep the people in the illusion.
[2:23:27.780 --> 2:23:37.780]  It's exactly like 1984, the majority of the bureaucratic elites had to believe in the propaganda that was dished out every day.
[2:23:37.780 --> 2:23:40.780]  It didn't matter about those of the very, very bots on there.
[2:23:40.780 --> 2:23:43.780]  They literally were adapt to any system they're given.
[2:23:43.780 --> 2:23:48.780]  However, when there's a rapid change in their standard of living, they will kill the messenger.
[2:23:48.780 --> 2:23:56.780]  So they have the limbo and characters like that to cater to the masses who want to live in the old think, as they call it, the old system.
[2:23:56.780 --> 2:24:00.780]  Even though it is changing around them, they will deny their own perceptions.
[2:24:00.780 --> 2:24:08.780]  Exactly. I always hear limbo and Hannity still saying WMDs were found, even as the UN and Bush admit that it was staged, was fake.
[2:24:08.780 --> 2:24:13.780]  It doesn't matter. They still say every day, no, it's real. No, the WMDs were there.
[2:24:13.780 --> 2:24:17.780]  Again, they're kind of living in the old model or the old download.
[2:24:17.780 --> 2:24:25.780]  Yes, and that's their jobs to cater to those who are heavily brainwashed, who are timid, who are scared and who could not face a rapid change.
[2:24:25.780 --> 2:24:35.780]  They want to believe that things will somehow get better, but more importantly, they think that they hope it'll go back to the past and nothing ever goes back to the past.
[2:24:35.780 --> 2:24:39.780]  Well, that's double think, double speak, crime stop. They, subconsciously, it's too scary.
[2:24:39.780 --> 2:24:52.780]  They make the decision to lie to themselves and say it's not happening, even as it is happening, as they put troops on the streets, as Marines run checkpoints at DWI checkpoints on the road against U.S. citizens.
[2:24:52.780 --> 2:25:07.780]  They come back and say, no, it's not true. And then limbo and others give them psychological sounding board or cover to say, see, there's still a media saying it doesn't exist, even as the other mainline media tells the slaves, get ready for this, we're doing it.
[2:25:07.780 --> 2:25:16.780]  Yes, and the rest of the media keeps them in old think with lots and lots and lots of trivia. That's exactly what Bertrand Russell said, to be with Fed, is nothing but trivia.
[2:25:16.780 --> 2:25:26.780]  And trivia is mixed with important news, and so they can't tell the difference. Everything is surreal to them, surrealistic, and their world they live in is surrealistic.
[2:25:26.780 --> 2:25:42.780]  And when the troops are, just like the Soviet Union, you know, as Solzhenitsyn said, at first when the NKVD, which became the KGB, came to arrest people next door to you, they would turn the whole street out under Soviet law to witness the arrest.
[2:25:42.780 --> 2:25:47.780]  That was to have the powerful effect of terrifying the onlookers, you see.
[2:25:47.780 --> 2:25:49.780]  Now they shell it to us on cops in the news.
[2:25:49.780 --> 2:26:05.780]  Yes, and it's basically entertainment now, we've had, I watched, I remember when the Hill Street Blues was pushed up to the top to be a big time worldwide series about New York NYPD, and it also had the SWAT teams in every series.
[2:26:05.780 --> 2:26:16.780]  And they go through all this mental language, should they use them or not, but they were getting familiarized with the idea of SWAT teams, and then about five, six, seven years later you saw it actually happening in real life.
[2:26:16.780 --> 2:26:27.780]  So who was emulating who, what were we doing, what were we getting through the Hill Street Blues was being familiarized with predictive programming for that, which was to...
[2:26:27.780 --> 2:26:35.780]  And on those shows they would torture innocent people, they would break rules, they'd say, I want to say the little girl, but I don't have a warrant, screw it, do it without a warrant.
[2:26:35.780 --> 2:26:51.780]  And then they make her new heroes, the people that torture and violate the law and set people up, and now SWAT teams are raiding Amish farmers who give unpasteurized milk to their neighbors, or who don't register their farm when there's not even a law.
[2:26:51.780 --> 2:26:58.780]  Now the SWAT teams are used at checkpoints on the highway or to go to people's houses for traffic warrants.
[2:26:58.780 --> 2:27:09.780]  Now the entire police force is being converted over to these ring rights, excellent points, amazing insight from Alan Watt cutting through the matrix to put his website up on screen, stay with us.
[2:27:28.780 --> 2:27:38.780]  Some generators are used by remediation contractors and homeowners alike to sterilize homes and cars, making them free from bacteria, moles, viruses, and complete removal of secondhand smoke.
[2:27:38.780 --> 2:27:43.780]  Patoters, you name it, what else can three oxygen atoms, in other words, ozone do?
[2:27:43.780 --> 2:27:50.780]  Many hospitals sterilize their operating rooms with ozone before and after operations, and have you ever heard of ozone therapy?
[2:27:50.780 --> 2:28:00.780]  IonicZone has a wealth of information on ozone therapy. Ozone therapy is used among other things to raise the body's oxygen level, which studies suggest boosts the immune system.
[2:28:00.780 --> 2:28:10.780]  You can learn more about ozone therapy or IonicZone ozone generators by going to ionicszone.com or calling 800-549-9535.

[2:28:19.780 --> 2:28:28.780]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to grounds here and we knew what to do, or at least we thought we did.
[2:28:28.780 --> 2:28:35.780]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[2:28:35.780 --> 2:28:44.780]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18 made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[2:28:44.780 --> 2:28:51.780]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[2:28:51.780 --> 2:29:00.780]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown. He takes his hand off and you hear three, two, one, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

[2:29:18.780 --> 2:29:25.780]  Alex Jones here with a question. What does humidity mean to you? Most people think of hot and sticky summer days.
[2:29:25.780 --> 2:29:30.780]  But many people are beginning to realize that humidity can be a valuable source of pure drinking water.

[2:30:59.780 --> 2:31:08.780]  And we also archived this and posted four members at PrismPlanet.tv. We're going to go back to Alan Watt of Cutting Through the Matrix here in just a moment.
[2:31:08.780 --> 2:31:17.780]  Before we do that, I want to tell you about some of the sponsors that make this transmission possible. And one of them is MySolarBackup.com.
[2:31:17.780 --> 2:31:23.780]  A lot of things can cut off your electrical power, hurricanes, snow, ice, and storms. Listeners should move towards getting off the grid.
[2:31:23.780 --> 2:31:28.780]  And here's a good way to do that because, folks, we have to become independent, not dependent on the system.
[2:31:28.780 --> 2:31:38.780]  MySolarPower Generator is now available from our longtime sponsor, Solutions from Science. It's designed to provide 1,800 watts of power on demand in the event of any disaster or outage.
[2:31:38.780 --> 2:31:46.780]  You can get an emergency power backup kit, which consists of the Power Source 1800 power plant and a high efficiency solar panel designed to provide endless electricity.
[2:31:46.780 --> 2:31:54.780]  That's right. It generates free electricity. Remember, too, that gas generators need gas. But in blackouts, gas pumps can't pump gas because they run on electricity.
[2:31:54.780 --> 2:32:01.780]  The solar power generator is like having a silent power plant hidden in your home. It's the perfect emergency backup for troubled times.
[2:32:01.780 --> 2:32:11.780]  Their website is MySolarBackup, one word, MySolarBackup.com. Or give them a call, get a free brochure, order a unit, 877-327-0365.
[2:32:11.780 --> 2:32:19.780]  They have these all in stock. The best unit they could find. 877-327-0365. Their lines are busy. Keep calling back.
[2:32:19.780 --> 2:32:30.780]  877-327-0365. Also, you know about a cola blue, ladies and gentlemen, the atmospheric water generator that is taking the country by storm.
[2:32:30.780 --> 2:32:36.780]  It grabs 7.5 gallons a day just with their smaller unit. Very affordable out of the atmosphere.
[2:32:36.780 --> 2:32:42.780]  And then the scissor just condensate. It puts it through five major filters and two sub filters.
[2:32:42.780 --> 2:32:50.780]  The water passes through an activated carbon filter, then a silver and pregnant carbon filter, then a reverse osmosis system and a taste and color odor removal filter.
[2:32:50.780 --> 2:32:58.780]  And it's stored in an illuminated tank by antibacterial fungal UV light. And the machine comes in red, black, white, green, silver and blue.
[2:32:58.780 --> 2:33:02.780]  And I have one at the office and one at my home. And we love it. The water is incredible.
[2:33:02.780 --> 2:33:09.780]  A colablue.com. Big banners up on infowars.com. A colablue.com or 866-585-4044.
[2:33:09.780 --> 2:33:14.780]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, going back to Alan Watt, I've been throwing a lot of questions at you, Alan.
[2:33:14.780 --> 2:33:21.780]  And I'm going to put up on screen again just one article because a Bilderberg group member, Mr. Wolf, is the editor of this.
[2:33:21.780 --> 2:33:29.780]  And their foreign affairs editor, Gideon Raykman, wrote the story, and now for a world government.
[2:33:29.780 --> 2:33:37.780]  I want to give you some time before we go to calls to flesh out more of, because this is key in my understanding.
[2:33:37.780 --> 2:33:43.780]  But I want to get your view and your nuance to understanding on this in some detail.
[2:33:43.780 --> 2:33:50.780]  Again, why now are they not just saying world government is what we need, but that they've secretly, this is all over the news,
[2:33:50.780 --> 2:33:56.780]  building a world government for decades. They have an image of cave drawings.
[2:33:56.780 --> 2:34:00.780]  You know, that's the editorial cartoon at the top of cave drawings.
[2:34:00.780 --> 2:34:09.780]  And then drawn on the wall next to images of primitive Aborigines, hunting deer, and elk, and primitive bovine,
[2:34:09.780 --> 2:34:15.780]  they have the image of a globe or a world government. The message here I get is, we are the elite.
[2:34:15.780 --> 2:34:19.780]  We've been in control of your destiny for thousands of years since primitive times.
[2:34:19.780 --> 2:34:22.780]  We've always wanted a world government, and now we're getting one.
[2:34:22.780 --> 2:34:31.780]  The ancient dream is being realized. I believe this is the esoteric meaning of the editorial drawing.
[2:34:31.780 --> 2:34:34.780]  Please give us your take on this.
[2:34:34.780 --> 2:34:41.780]  Well, part of the drawing, too, is to do with primitive man, primitive man hunting for his necessities.
[2:34:41.780 --> 2:34:48.780]  And, of course, it's also due to evolution as well, coming from the primitive, from tribal, into global society.
[2:34:48.780 --> 2:34:54.780]  So, from differences all coming together as one under one system of domination.
[2:34:54.780 --> 2:34:57.780]  We have the wild humans being taken under the control. Go ahead.
[2:34:57.780 --> 2:35:03.780]  And you also have this elite themselves who do believe in evolution.
[2:35:03.780 --> 2:35:07.780]  They believe that they are the most evolved type of humans on the planet.
[2:35:07.780 --> 2:35:14.780]  And it's been written about by wells and the Fabian society and many, many others down through the last hundred odd years or more.
[2:35:14.780 --> 2:35:22.780]  They believe that they have the right to rule mankind because they've proven their worth by the accumulation of vast amounts of wealth,
[2:35:22.780 --> 2:35:28.780]  power over the public, control over the public, and have held onto it through generations.
[2:35:28.780 --> 2:35:32.780]  In other words, they haven't squandered it away through bad breeding, as they call it.
[2:35:32.780 --> 2:35:39.780]  They have selective breeding, especially, picked wives for them to breed with.
[2:35:39.780 --> 2:35:46.780]  And they've been doing this for at least a couple of hundred years, as far as we know, as far as the inbreeding goes in documents that they have put out themselves.
[2:35:46.780 --> 2:35:54.780]  Probably much, much longer. But they do believe they're evolved, and therefore they've simply taken their natural right to dominate the planet.
[2:35:54.780 --> 2:36:04.780]  They say themselves, and we find in the writings of Charles Galton Darwin, who was one of them, he was the descendant of very inbred people.
[2:36:04.780 --> 2:36:14.780]  But they were all bred to be special scientists, and he hints at that in his own writings of the different types that were already bred to dominate the world.
[2:36:14.780 --> 2:36:26.780]  But he said that the dominant minority who will rule and own the world must not have their ability for self-preservation taken away as the masses will have.
[2:36:26.780 --> 2:36:31.780]  The masses won't need self-preservation because the state will be making all the decisions for them.
[2:36:31.780 --> 2:36:37.780]  But he says, we, the elites, must retain our wild instincts. In other words, the laws will not apply to them.
[2:36:37.780 --> 2:36:39.780]  Any kind of law will not apply. That's why there's so many deviant...
[2:36:39.780 --> 2:36:48.780]  We saw that in Rome, where the elite families and the Caesar could murder, kill, rape, steal, take anybody's daughter they wanted.
[2:36:48.780 --> 2:36:56.780]  They could force the lower Romans to give their daughters at age 12 into the temples, which were the prostitution centers.
[2:36:56.780 --> 2:37:04.780]  And we see the Romans training them that people being beat up and killed was entertainment, was fun, to dehumanize the public.
[2:37:04.780 --> 2:37:11.780]  And now we see Burger King, I did confirm what Alistair told me a few days ago, with the new slogan, as if anybody else matters.
[2:37:11.780 --> 2:37:15.780]  And that speaks to the subconscious, to the id, the animal. Go ahead and hurt yourself.
[2:37:15.780 --> 2:37:24.780]  Go ahead and eat the MSG and Aspartame with a subconscious mirror of that they're really hurting the rest of the public and greedily only helping themselves.
[2:37:24.780 --> 2:37:29.780]  That's right. So we've had this global system running.
[2:37:29.780 --> 2:37:35.780]  We know for hundreds of years in reality, there never was democracy in Britain.
[2:37:35.780 --> 2:37:44.780]  Although it proclaimed that all the time we had the democracy, they never ever had that because the British elite watched the French Revolution very, very carefully.
[2:37:44.780 --> 2:37:51.780]  And they knew that this was a movement that was going to keep going and pop up again and again this drive for democracy.
[2:37:51.780 --> 2:37:54.780]  Because people wanted to say in their life and their lifestyles.
[2:37:54.780 --> 2:37:58.780]  And therefore they decided to give the public a fake, a front.
[2:37:58.780 --> 2:38:01.780]  And it's worked very, very well.
[2:38:01.780 --> 2:38:09.780]  Margaret Thatcher, in her first speech, said that we are part of the parallel government that's unelected by the public.
[2:38:09.780 --> 2:38:18.780]  She said she was a member. She was simply, again, we are treating what Carl Quigley said, Professor Carl Quigley, when he also mentioned this parallel government.
[2:38:18.780 --> 2:38:21.780]  So they've been at it for a long, long time.
[2:38:21.780 --> 2:38:29.780]  The idea was to unite the world and unite many different tribes and people's cultures through conflict.
[2:38:29.780 --> 2:38:32.780]  And therefore the fastest way to do it was to create oppositions.
[2:38:32.780 --> 2:38:38.780]  They took over a good chunk of Europe and Siberia by the Soviet system.
[2:38:38.780 --> 2:38:40.780]  That standardised a massive chunk of it.
[2:38:40.780 --> 2:38:44.780]  They used the same technique in the Far East under the guise of communism.
[2:38:44.780 --> 2:38:48.780]  And now they call them democratic countries.
[2:38:48.780 --> 2:38:55.780]  But what it did was standardise one system copied from the British exoteric system into their system.
[2:38:55.780 --> 2:38:57.780]  And you have a standardised world now.
[2:38:57.780 --> 2:38:59.780]  Now it's time to bring it all together.
[2:38:59.780 --> 2:39:02.780]  Now that we're all the same education systems.
[2:39:02.780 --> 2:39:04.780]  We're taught the same nonsense in school.
[2:39:04.780 --> 2:39:07.780]  We're all taught the same fake facts and histories and so on.
[2:39:07.780 --> 2:39:10.780]  So now they can standardise us quite simply and easily.
[2:39:10.780 --> 2:39:14.780]  And the front organisation for this is the United Nations.
[2:39:14.780 --> 2:39:18.780]  When you look at the foundations, and that's how the parallel governments operated,
[2:39:18.780 --> 2:39:24.780]  was the creation of foundations with masses of money to fund their NGOs.
[2:39:24.780 --> 2:39:27.780]  The Soviet system was run by NGOs.
[2:39:27.780 --> 2:39:30.780]  The leaders were picked by the Politburo.
[2:39:30.780 --> 2:39:33.780]  We now have them picked by the parallel government.
[2:39:33.780 --> 2:39:39.780]  And the US and British governments allied foundations openly ran the Soviet Union.
[2:39:39.780 --> 2:39:43.780]  So if you want to know what the future is, you only need to read what the foundations are saying.
[2:39:43.780 --> 2:39:48.780]  Why don't you tell folks what the foundations' main goals are, where we are in the world system,
[2:39:48.780 --> 2:39:52.780]  how deep we're actually into it, and what you think we're going to see with the economy unfold.
[2:39:52.780 --> 2:39:55.780]  And we're going to go to calls in the next few years, Alan.
[2:39:55.780 --> 2:40:00.780]  Well, what they've said already is that the system they will bring in has to win us away
[2:40:00.780 --> 2:40:06.780]  from our selfish need for self-preservation and accumulation of personal wealth,
[2:40:06.780 --> 2:40:08.780]  regardless of the class you're born into.
[2:40:08.780 --> 2:40:11.780]  So that's getting rid of our instinct to become independent,
[2:40:11.780 --> 2:40:17.780]  take care of ourselves in the hierarchy of needs, saying it's selfish to have a self-preservation mode.
[2:40:17.780 --> 2:40:22.780]  That's what all this environmentalism that's fake is about, is to make us feel bad about being humans,
[2:40:22.780 --> 2:40:26.780]  so they can train us on loving our servitude, loving our feudal serfdom.
[2:40:26.780 --> 2:40:33.780]  That's right. And it's also part of the very system of the Royal Institute of International Affairs,
[2:40:33.780 --> 2:40:38.780]  which runs the Council on Foreign Relations. And they have said that the world we bring in
[2:40:38.780 --> 2:40:42.780]  is one of servitude to the world state, servitude to the world state.
[2:40:42.780 --> 2:40:46.780]  And they will decide from the top what servitude means.
[2:40:46.780 --> 2:40:52.780]  It means giving your whole life, your whole activity, your energy, your very thoughts to the world state.
[2:40:52.780 --> 2:40:54.780]  It's based on the doctrine of Plato.
[2:40:54.780 --> 2:40:56.780]  And who can have children? Eugenics, yes.
[2:40:56.780 --> 2:41:01.780]  Yeah. Plato was a member, a member of the ancient societies. He studied in Egypt.
[2:41:01.780 --> 2:41:05.780]  He was initiated in Egypt, the Palestine area.
[2:41:05.780 --> 2:41:10.780]  And in India, that was the standard route he went on, he wrote about it himself.
[2:41:10.780 --> 2:41:15.780]  And then he said in the book called Republic, the one that H.G. Wells said was his Bible.
[2:41:15.780 --> 2:41:20.780]  Plato said, what's the problem about owning all this money and having castles?
[2:41:20.780 --> 2:41:26.780]  He says, you're afraid of being robbed by the people, you're afraid, you have to pay all your servants, etc.
[2:41:26.780 --> 2:41:34.780]  Isn't it far better that the people under the guise that you're ruling them on their behalf, they build the castle for you,
[2:41:34.780 --> 2:41:41.780]  they supply its maintenance, they pay for the servants, they pay for anything that's stolen or replaced it for you.
[2:41:41.780 --> 2:41:46.780]  That's what we have today. This new system with its higher level of, and they'll still call themselves servants,
[2:41:46.780 --> 2:41:51.780]  the Kissinger types will live in their massive palaces, Shafford driven, etc.
[2:41:51.780 --> 2:41:56.780]  and still pretend they're part of you the same as you. This was the Soviet system.
[2:41:56.780 --> 2:42:02.780]  And every new crisis they create, they will always be the saviors for the next solution,
[2:42:02.780 --> 2:42:06.780]  which is even deeper into dehumanization and degradation.
[2:42:06.780 --> 2:42:11.780]  Here's an example. About a year ago, I have some employees, the Texas Workforce Commission,
[2:42:11.780 --> 2:42:17.780]  sent me a filing in the mail and it said, you now have to answer these hundreds of questions every year.
[2:42:17.780 --> 2:42:24.780]  This is a North American Union survey. And I went on my show, I went on the web,
[2:42:24.780 --> 2:42:29.780]  I put it on the website, infowars.com, and people commented that it wasn't real and it was fake.
[2:42:29.780 --> 2:42:37.780]  Now I have an image up on screen of Kroger's and it says, product of US, Mexico and Canada,
[2:42:37.780 --> 2:42:41.780]  or product of US, Canada and Mexico. So everything's converting over to this.
[2:42:41.780 --> 2:42:47.780]  As you know, they started a year and a half ago, it's in my film Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement,
[2:42:47.780 --> 2:42:53.780]  merging the European Union and the North American Union. Bush goes to the Rose Garden with Merkel and Barroso, announces it,
[2:42:53.780 --> 2:42:57.780]  but then anybody that talks about it is called a cook by Rush Limbaugh.
[2:42:57.780 --> 2:43:04.780]  So how do you see this conversion happening into the next year as they parallel continue to say it doesn't exist,
[2:43:04.780 --> 2:43:08.780]  while on the other side they say it does exist and it's happening.
[2:43:08.780 --> 2:43:13.780]  I mean, how do you see the mind slaves out there who've been conditioned that this doesn't exist?
[2:43:13.780 --> 2:43:16.780]  I guess the conditioning is just meant to neutralize them long enough,
[2:43:16.780 --> 2:43:20.780]  so they debate whether it exists or not until it's too late and already in place.
[2:43:20.780 --> 2:43:25.780]  Yes, most folk are never really in a conscious reality at any time.
[2:43:25.780 --> 2:43:32.780]  Most of the people who are brainwashed, and that's the majority of the public who get their reality from television.
[2:43:32.780 --> 2:43:40.780]  Television is so surrealistic, you cannot possibly retain your sanity and your cognitive thinking abilities and reasoning powers
[2:43:40.780 --> 2:43:43.780]  and watch it and enjoy it. At the same time, you can't have both.
[2:43:43.780 --> 2:43:49.780]  It's meant to put you into a strange state where gradually, through osmosis almost, you come to accept new facts
[2:43:49.780 --> 2:43:53.780]  without ever consciously thinking through those facts, you adopt them,
[2:43:53.780 --> 2:43:58.780]  and you're upgraded like a computer program each time you look into it.
[2:43:58.780 --> 2:44:02.780]  And here's a bunch of new facts and you'll parrot them too, and you won't even remember.
[2:44:02.780 --> 2:44:07.780]  You had different facts that you parroted yesterday. That's already in society.
[2:44:07.780 --> 2:44:09.780]  That's how most folk are working today.
[2:44:09.780 --> 2:44:11.780]  And that's what Orwell talked about.
[2:44:11.780 --> 2:44:14.780]  It didn't matter if they said we're always at war with East Asia.
[2:44:14.780 --> 2:44:16.780]  The next day we were never at war with East Asia.
[2:44:16.780 --> 2:44:20.780]  In Big Brother's world, they had to go back and destroy all the old newspapers and TV programs.
[2:44:20.780 --> 2:44:23.780]  Here, they just run it all parallel and say,
[2:44:23.780 --> 2:44:28.780]  I mean, they've skipped to the final phase where Winston's on the gurney being tortured.
[2:44:28.780 --> 2:44:32.780]  And he says, do I have four fingers, two fingers, five fingers, ten fingers?
[2:44:32.780 --> 2:44:34.780]  And he says, look, just tell me how many fingers to see.
[2:44:34.780 --> 2:44:38.780]  And he said, no. What I want you to do is see all fingers at once
[2:44:38.780 --> 2:44:41.780]  and not be able to differentiate and just lay there like a jellyfish.
[2:44:41.780 --> 2:44:44.780]  And he goes, oh, now I see. I love Big Brother.
[2:44:44.780 --> 2:44:47.780]  And O'Brien says, now you understand.
[2:44:47.780 --> 2:44:50.780]  We're here to tear you apart and dominate you.
[2:44:50.780 --> 2:44:53.780]  We are the priests of power, survival of the fittest.
[2:44:53.780 --> 2:44:57.780]  This is about crushing humanity and even ourselves and reducing the language down to nothing.
[2:44:57.780 --> 2:44:59.780]  And we see they've now done that.
[2:44:59.780 --> 2:45:01.780]  That's right. They have done it.
[2:45:01.780 --> 2:45:05.780]  There are people who are halfway waking up and it's like Winston on the table again.
[2:45:05.780 --> 2:45:08.780]  And he says, I'm really trying to see four.
[2:45:08.780 --> 2:45:12.780]  And O'Brien says, that's not good enough. You've got to really believe it.
[2:45:12.780 --> 2:45:17.780]  And so they're in a cogmire, really, of conflicting facts.
[2:45:17.780 --> 2:45:21.780]  Because fear works in most people. People are afraid.
[2:45:21.780 --> 2:45:25.780]  And this, again, is why we're getting this predictive programming of the coming conflicts.
[2:45:25.780 --> 2:45:27.780]  And O'Brien, finishing a moment. This is so key.
[2:45:27.780 --> 2:45:32.780]  O'Brien wants him to have that mental break into delusion, into mental illness.
[2:45:32.780 --> 2:45:35.780]  That's what the system, the schools do. They train you how to be insane.
[2:45:35.780 --> 2:45:38.780]  It's insane to want to drink fluoride and eat GMO food.
[2:45:38.780 --> 2:45:42.780]  It's insane to drink aspartame and MSG and excitotoxins.
[2:45:42.780 --> 2:45:47.780]  It's insane to have cancer up by three, four thousand percent and diabetes and autism.
[2:45:47.780 --> 2:45:51.780]  It's insane to be attacking innocent countries and to have the White House Press Secretary say,
[2:45:51.780 --> 2:45:54.780]  Iraq loves us. They all love us.
[2:45:54.780 --> 2:45:58.780]  Meanwhile, they have polls over there of 90 plus percent hating what the United States does.
[2:45:58.780 --> 2:46:02.780]  But she comes to the U.S. and says, no, they all love us.
[2:46:02.780 --> 2:46:11.780]  That's right. The official version is, you see, we're living under what's becoming open authoritarianism.
[2:46:11.780 --> 2:46:14.780]  It truly is the Orwellian system.
[2:46:14.780 --> 2:46:21.780]  And yet it's only to be for part of a phase, the 30-year phase, and the income, the Huxley part of it.
[2:46:21.780 --> 2:46:28.780]  Because at the end of the 30 years, and during the 30 years, they hope to bring forth the new type of enhanced human
[2:46:28.780 --> 2:46:33.780]  that will serve them better, that will be unable to even dream of conflict against their masters.
[2:46:33.780 --> 2:46:36.780]  And this is a 30-year hot war against humanity.
[2:46:36.780 --> 2:46:41.780]  It goes into the THX1138 lobotomized suboid population.
[2:46:41.780 --> 2:46:44.780]  Yes, and this present generation is dying off.
[2:46:44.780 --> 2:46:48.780]  It's dying off even in the Army's war colleges' own figures.
[2:46:48.780 --> 2:46:51.780]  And the studies they do, you have to really look at their studies.
[2:46:51.780 --> 2:46:54.780]  They use history to the maximum. That's why they chose 30 years.
[2:46:54.780 --> 2:46:56.780]  They studied the 30 years war.
[2:46:56.780 --> 2:47:00.780]  And they say, we've got the American people. We've enslaved them.
[2:47:00.780 --> 2:47:04.780]  And that's what's so horrifying is to read all this, to show the viewers this,
[2:47:04.780 --> 2:47:06.780]  to know they're cold-bloodily doing this.
[2:47:06.780 --> 2:47:08.780]  This is not our military. This is not our government.
[2:47:08.780 --> 2:47:12.780]  I mean, what is this we're facing? What is this scientific technocracy?
[2:47:12.780 --> 2:47:14.780]  Yes, well, and what would it say?
[2:47:14.780 --> 2:47:21.780]  The military college has already had a big bunch of articles up on projected population declines in the West.
[2:47:21.780 --> 2:47:26.780]  And because they've been following it for 50 years since they've been sterilizing the Western males.
[2:47:26.780 --> 2:47:32.780]  And they know at the end of 30 years, time will all be dead with cancers and so on, and infertile anyway.
[2:47:32.780 --> 2:47:40.780]  So they've said themselves that many of the European countries are past the point of repopulation,
[2:47:40.780 --> 2:47:43.780]  of coming back again in the same numbers they were before.
[2:47:43.780 --> 2:47:48.780]  And they crow this. They brag on NPR. Isn't it great the evil West is dying? Isn't it wonderful?
[2:47:48.780 --> 2:47:52.780]  Oh, I mean, these are the sickest. This is nihilistic self-suicide.
[2:47:52.780 --> 2:47:56.780]  Yeah, I tell you, Hitler was a boy scout compared to these boys.
[2:47:56.780 --> 2:47:59.780]  All right, we come back. I'm going to go to calls the next hour. We come back, though.
[2:47:59.780 --> 2:48:08.780]  I want to talk about the minions, the technocrats that have a piece of the pyramidal structure who know its eugenics,
[2:48:08.780 --> 2:48:13.780]  but who have this fake environmental idea that humans are bad and it's a great thing to kill off the parasites.
[2:48:13.780 --> 2:48:18.780]  Don't they understand that it's they themselves and their families that are also going to be wiped out?
[2:48:18.780 --> 2:48:22.780]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[2:48:22.780 --> 2:48:26.780]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[2:48:26.780 --> 2:48:32.780]  Solar power generators are now available from Solutions from Science, one of GCN's oldest and most trusted sponsors.
[2:48:32.780 --> 2:48:37.780]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most.
[2:48:37.780 --> 2:48:43.780]  Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity for free.
[2:48:43.780 --> 2:48:46.780]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[2:48:46.780 --> 2:48:51.780]  Run some pumps, shortwave radios, computers, and even keep food from spoiling.
[2:48:51.780 --> 2:48:57.780]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[2:48:57.780 --> 2:49:02.780]  When the power goes out, you'll be ready with a solar power generator from Solutions from Science.
[2:49:02.780 --> 2:49:07.780]  Go to mysolarbackup.com and get off the grid today.
[2:49:07.780 --> 2:49:10.780]  That's mysolarbackup.com today.
[2:49:10.780 --> 2:49:14.780]  Or call 877-327-0365.
[2:49:14.780 --> 2:49:17.780]  877-327-0365.
[2:49:17.780 --> 2:49:19.780]  Don't wait. Call today.
[2:49:19.780 --> 2:49:26.780]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[2:49:26.780 --> 2:49:30.780]  The enemy struck America on September 11th. But who is the enemy?
[2:49:30.780 --> 2:49:32.780]  Bin Laden. This is his MO.
[2:49:32.780 --> 2:49:35.780]  We have to look to the Middle East. We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[2:49:35.780 --> 2:49:42.780]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[2:49:42.780 --> 2:49:49.780]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[2:49:49.780 --> 2:49:53.780]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[2:49:53.780 --> 2:50:00.780]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers' ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network,
[2:50:00.780 --> 2:50:03.780]  warnings in war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[2:50:03.780 --> 2:50:12.780]  Fabled Enemies, get the DVD at infowars.com, or see it in super high quality, along with hundreds of other titles at prisonplanet.tv.
[2:50:12.780 --> 2:50:34.780]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[2:50:43.780 --> 2:50:47.780]  My blood pressure has normalized. My diabetes has totally improved.
[2:50:47.780 --> 2:50:51.780]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look, and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[2:50:51.780 --> 2:50:53.780]  I recommend heart and body extract to everyone.
[2:50:53.780 --> 2:51:01.780]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.

[2:51:18.780 --> 2:51:38.780]  There's a man going around taking names, and he decides who to free and who to blame.
[2:51:38.780 --> 2:51:43.780]  Everybody won't be treated all the same.
[2:51:43.780 --> 2:51:58.780]  There'll be a golden letter reaching down when the man comes around.
[2:51:58.780 --> 2:52:09.780]  Bottom line, this is a bunch of loveliest control freaks playing gods, taking control of our genetics, the planet's genetics,
[2:52:09.780 --> 2:52:15.780]  taking control of our water, our food, one-child policies, controlled plagues, all of it.
[2:52:15.780 --> 2:52:19.780]  Alan, getting back into the question I asked you about the minions of this system.
[2:52:19.780 --> 2:52:27.780]  They're trained that their identity is being members of the elite, but 99% of them are not true members of the elite,
[2:52:27.780 --> 2:52:29.780]  and they're going against their very human code.
[2:52:29.780 --> 2:52:34.780]  Can you speak to their programming and ways to break that, or ways to defeat this? Alan, what?
[2:52:34.780 --> 2:52:39.780]  They are the bureaucratic types that Orwell shows.
[2:52:39.780 --> 2:52:44.780]  The movie that was done in Britain with Richard Burton and John Hurt were excellent, really.
[2:52:44.780 --> 2:52:47.780]  They showed you this bureaucratic elite that controls the masses.
[2:52:47.780 --> 2:52:50.780]  They kept saying the masses don't count, they call them the pros.
[2:52:50.780 --> 2:52:54.780]  They kept saying the pros don't count, in other words, they would take whatever they were given.
[2:52:54.780 --> 2:53:00.780]  The main thrust of propaganda and indoctrination was actually done on the bureaucratic class themselves,
[2:53:00.780 --> 2:53:08.780]  who had to adapt to the new paradigms that were given to them every other week, and really believe it themselves.
[2:53:08.780 --> 2:53:11.780]  And of course, the Winston character was one of those bureaucrats.
[2:53:11.780 --> 2:53:18.780]  He broke free of it himself, or else his indoctrination didn't take quite properly, and he was being observed.
[2:53:18.780 --> 2:53:25.780]  Now, I've talked to quite a few bureaucrats, and they are in a strange state between reality.
[2:53:25.780 --> 2:53:31.780]  They know what's going on, they're quite aware of it. They also have this battle of self-interest.
[2:53:31.780 --> 2:53:34.780]  They do love the lifestyle they're given. They're very well-paid.
[2:53:34.780 --> 2:53:38.780]  They mix with their own kind all the time.
[2:53:38.780 --> 2:53:40.780]  They read the books they're advised to read.
[2:53:40.780 --> 2:53:46.780]  There's lots of books put out there by intellectuals that are designed to work on the bureaucratic class,
[2:53:46.780 --> 2:53:54.780]  to re-bolster their present belief systems as being superior, and yet they themselves are also afraid that they'll fall from grace.
[2:53:54.780 --> 2:53:58.780]  That's the worst thing that could happen to one of these lifelong bureaucrats,
[2:53:58.780 --> 2:54:04.780]  especially the hereditary ones, is falling from grace and falling down amongst the cesspools,
[2:54:04.780 --> 2:54:07.780]  they say, of the masses, the unwashed masses.
[2:54:07.780 --> 2:54:13.780]  So they do know that their time is numbered too, because eventually there will be no more use for them.
[2:54:13.780 --> 2:54:20.780]  However, each one who is alive today will believe they'll live their life in a fair good standard of luxury
[2:54:20.780 --> 2:54:25.780]  while the system goes down. They don't care very much about those that come after them,
[2:54:25.780 --> 2:54:27.780]  as long as they're okay.
[2:54:27.780 --> 2:54:33.780]  So self-interest plays a big, big part in all of this.
[2:54:33.780 --> 2:54:38.780]  I've got the Phoenix Business Journal today on the heels of us yesterday writing a story about this.
[2:54:38.780 --> 2:54:43.780]  Arizona police say they're prepared as war college warrants military must prep
[2:54:43.780 --> 2:54:47.780]  for unrest, IMF warrants of economic crises and riots.
[2:54:47.780 --> 2:54:52.780]  And we, meanwhile, have all these presidents and prime ministers coming out saying
[2:54:52.780 --> 2:54:55.780]  we're now going to have a depression.
[2:54:55.780 --> 2:54:58.780]  So while they were getting their own money prepared and safe,
[2:54:58.780 --> 2:55:00.780]  they were telling the public everything was fine.
[2:55:00.780 --> 2:55:03.780]  Now they're coming in trying to destroy confidence.
[2:55:03.780 --> 2:55:07.780]  This is just incredible.
[2:55:07.780 --> 2:55:13.780]  What's even more so is the fact that when you look through the Army war college's own predictions
[2:55:13.780 --> 2:55:18.780]  from their think tanks, they say that there will be, during this time of rioting
[2:55:18.780 --> 2:55:23.780]  and conflict across the globe during the 30 years,
[2:55:23.780 --> 2:55:29.780]  there will be safe havens for the elite and the high-level bureaucrats themselves
[2:55:29.780 --> 2:55:33.780]  in certain parts of the world, which will live a very high standard of luxury
[2:55:33.780 --> 2:55:36.780]  compared to the rest of the planet.
[2:55:36.780 --> 2:55:40.780]  That's what they're building in the Middle East right now too, that's one of them.
[2:55:40.780 --> 2:55:43.780]  You know, Dubai and other areas. Stay there, Alan.
[2:55:43.780 --> 2:55:46.780]  We're going to take calls coming up in the next hour.
[2:55:46.780 --> 2:55:49.780]  But then at the bottom of the hour, I'm just going to give you the floor
[2:55:49.780 --> 2:55:53.780]  because you bring up so many things, so many points where I want to jump in.
[2:55:53.780 --> 2:55:57.780]  I'm going to give you the floor so you can go into any areas you think are most important.
[2:55:57.780 --> 2:56:01.780]  Stay with us.
[2:56:01.780 --> 2:56:03.780]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[2:56:18.780 --> 2:56:23.780]  an entirely new two-hour film that completely destroys the official fable forever.
[2:56:23.780 --> 2:56:27.780]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation
[2:56:27.780 --> 2:56:30.780]  in which family members receive answers to their questions
[2:56:30.780 --> 2:56:34.780]  and the true perpetrators of the horrendous crime are brought to justice.
[2:56:34.780 --> 2:56:37.780]  Loose Change Final Cut is the ultimate 9-11 expose.
[2:56:37.780 --> 2:56:41.780]  From hijackers being trained at U.S. military bases to bombs in the buildings,
[2:56:41.780 --> 2:56:45.780]  Loose Change Final Cut is the one 9-11 film everyone must see.

[2:57:07.780 --> 2:57:09.780]  to take the fight back to Big Brother.
[2:57:11.780 --> 2:57:13.780]  You are listening to GCN.
[2:57:13.780 --> 2:57:15.780]  Hello.
[2:57:32.780 --> 2:57:34.780]  We're back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[2:57:34.780 --> 2:57:36.780]  End of the fourth and final hour today.
[2:57:36.780 --> 2:57:38.780]  Our guest is Alan Watt.
[2:57:38.780 --> 2:57:42.780]  For anyone that doubts that the New World Order social engineers,
[2:57:42.780 --> 2:57:45.780]  we do horrible things in society.
[2:57:45.780 --> 2:57:51.780]  They publicly funded the Maoist, now declassified.
[2:57:51.780 --> 2:57:54.780]  All the old-timers in the military came back and told us that in 49,
[2:57:54.780 --> 2:57:57.780]  the U.S. government put them into power
[2:57:57.780 --> 2:58:00.780]  and then funded them to kill at least 60 million people.
[2:58:00.780 --> 2:58:01.780]  That's a conservative number.
[2:58:01.780 --> 2:58:04.780]  Some estimates are as high as 86 million.
[2:58:04.780 --> 2:58:08.780]  The big New York and London banks funded the Bolsheviks in 1917.
[2:58:08.780 --> 2:58:10.780]  Declassified on record.
[2:58:10.780 --> 2:58:12.780]  Mainline history is not on the nightly news.
[2:58:12.780 --> 2:58:14.780]  They funded Hitler, the Milner Group.
[2:58:14.780 --> 2:58:15.780]  They put them into power.
[2:58:15.780 --> 2:58:17.780]  They set them up.
[2:58:17.780 --> 2:58:20.780]  And so if you think they won't bring in a worldwide depression,
[2:58:20.780 --> 2:58:23.780]  so they can openly set up world government foreign by the banks
[2:58:23.780 --> 2:58:25.780]  where you buy your carbon credits directly from them,
[2:58:25.780 --> 2:58:26.780]  you've got nothing coming,
[2:58:26.780 --> 2:58:28.780]  all those years we told you they would do just that,
[2:58:28.780 --> 2:58:30.780]  now they're announcing it and doing it.
[2:58:30.780 --> 2:58:32.780]  We don't deserve any accolades here, folks.
[2:58:32.780 --> 2:58:34.780]  We just weren't under mind control.
[2:58:34.780 --> 2:58:36.780]  We could read what the Club of Rome and IMF and World Bank
[2:58:36.780 --> 2:58:39.780]  and Council on Fine Relations and Trilateral Commission were saying
[2:58:39.780 --> 2:58:42.780]  and doing in their own policy reports.
[2:58:42.780 --> 2:58:44.780]  We're going to come back in the next segment
[2:58:44.780 --> 2:58:45.780]  and go to all the callers.
[2:58:45.780 --> 2:58:48.780]  Matt, Chris, Ben, Brian, Tim,
[2:58:48.780 --> 2:58:50.780]  and many others that are patiently holding.
[2:58:50.780 --> 2:58:52.780]  But in the short segment, Alan Watt,
[2:58:52.780 --> 2:58:55.780]  we've talked about the mindset of the outer party.
[2:58:55.780 --> 2:58:57.780]  You have the prols, the outer party and the inner party
[2:58:57.780 --> 2:58:59.780]  in the pyramidal structure, the inner party at the top,
[2:58:59.780 --> 2:59:01.780]  the outer party and the elite
[2:59:01.780 --> 2:59:03.780]  who are some of the most oppressed and surveilled.
[2:59:03.780 --> 2:59:06.780]  The NSA is really there to spy on them, control them,
[2:59:06.780 --> 2:59:09.780]  burn a few of their minions to keep them all in line,
[2:59:09.780 --> 2:59:11.780]  selectively enforcing laws.
[2:59:11.780 --> 2:59:15.780]  Let's talk about some of the lower-level minions,
[2:59:15.780 --> 2:59:18.780]  the police, the military, those that have been slowly twisted
[2:59:18.780 --> 2:59:20.780]  to accept all of this.
[2:59:20.780 --> 2:59:23.780]  What do they have to look forward to going along with this system?
[2:59:23.780 --> 2:59:26.780]  Well, what we have is really what's already happened
[2:59:26.780 --> 2:59:28.780]  over many years.
[2:59:28.780 --> 2:59:31.780]  And we've had a generation who've grown up
[2:59:31.780 --> 2:59:35.780]  very often in single-parent families, no fathers.
[2:59:35.780 --> 2:59:38.780]  Their choices were, you know, joined the little gang
[2:59:38.780 --> 2:59:40.780]  that replaces your father.
[2:59:40.780 --> 2:59:42.780]  That's the only male figure you have.
[2:59:42.780 --> 2:59:44.780]  But they've also been brought up with video games
[2:59:44.780 --> 2:59:47.780]  and violence and guys wearing black uniforms
[2:59:47.780 --> 2:59:50.780]  with power and badges who seem to be the winners.
[2:59:50.780 --> 2:59:52.780]  That's what young men see.
[2:59:52.780 --> 2:59:54.780]  So they change the male archetype to a thug
[2:59:54.780 --> 2:59:56.780]  with an ugly look on his face, all the toys now,
[2:59:56.780 --> 2:59:59.780]  who's a UN soldier who beats people's brains in
[2:59:59.780 --> 3:00:01.780]  with no due process.
[3:00:01.780 --> 3:00:03.780]  And so the males then, like a baby duck, imprinting,
[3:00:03.780 --> 3:00:06.780]  they imprint on that through cover commander.
[3:00:06.780 --> 3:00:08.780]  There's no doubt at all.
[3:00:08.780 --> 3:00:11.780]  And they have raised the generation worldwide
[3:00:11.780 --> 3:00:14.780]  to have this image of the black uniform,
[3:00:14.780 --> 3:00:16.780]  the power, the big machine gun,
[3:00:16.780 --> 3:00:19.780]  and booting around these little people.
[3:00:19.780 --> 3:00:23.780]  They don't even seem to be human to these people in uniform.
[3:00:23.780 --> 3:00:26.780]  You see, the indoctrination, the scientific indoctrination
[3:00:26.780 --> 3:00:29.780]  of the military is very, very precise.
[3:00:29.780 --> 3:00:31.780]  And they know that males want to be warriors.
[3:00:31.780 --> 3:00:33.780]  So your dad, your grandpa, your grandma,
[3:00:33.780 --> 3:00:35.780]  they can't teach you how to shoot.
[3:00:35.780 --> 3:00:36.780]  You can't be armed.
[3:00:36.780 --> 3:00:37.780]  Civilians can't be armed.
[3:00:37.780 --> 3:00:39.780]  That gun culture is bad.
[3:00:39.780 --> 3:00:41.780]  But then if you go join the dark side,
[3:00:41.780 --> 3:00:44.780]  then you're allowed to carry out these male activities.
[3:00:44.780 --> 3:00:45.780]  You have that.
[3:00:45.780 --> 3:00:48.780]  But you also have that the tribalism is allowed
[3:00:48.780 --> 3:00:50.780]  to basically progress.
[3:00:50.780 --> 3:00:53.780]  You see in society, the stop to try basic tribalism
[3:00:53.780 --> 3:00:57.780]  has been condemned and condemned until it's a taboo.
[3:00:57.780 --> 3:01:00.780]  And then created false systems within their control.
[3:01:00.780 --> 3:01:01.780]  That's right.
[3:01:01.780 --> 3:01:03.780]  So you can join this fraternity, this brotherhood,
[3:01:03.780 --> 3:01:05.780]  and suddenly you're one of the gang.
[3:01:05.780 --> 3:01:07.780]  They'll fight and die for you.
[3:01:07.780 --> 3:01:08.780]  You'll lie for each other.
[3:01:08.780 --> 3:01:10.780]  The cops have been doing that forever.
[3:01:10.780 --> 3:01:14.780]  And so that's the whole paradigm there.
[3:01:14.780 --> 3:01:16.780]  And they're well-paid.
[3:01:16.780 --> 3:01:19.780]  They can also have little goodies and little things
[3:01:19.780 --> 3:01:21.780]  that the general public can't get access to.
[3:01:21.780 --> 3:01:23.780]  Special status.
[3:01:23.780 --> 3:01:24.780]  Yes.
[3:01:24.780 --> 3:01:26.780]  Take California where upwards of a million people
[3:01:26.780 --> 3:01:28.780]  can't get tickets, can't get DWIs,
[3:01:28.780 --> 3:01:31.780]  can't get red light cameras, because their license number
[3:01:31.780 --> 3:01:34.780]  is encoded in the computer as above the law.
[3:01:34.780 --> 3:01:35.780]  That's correct.
[3:01:35.780 --> 3:01:39.780]  And so you do have a militarized youth that've grown up
[3:01:39.780 --> 3:01:42.780]  with the games that have been desensitized to killing
[3:01:42.780 --> 3:01:44.780]  because that's what the games are all about,
[3:01:44.780 --> 3:01:46.780]  is getting from the beginning to the end
[3:01:46.780 --> 3:01:48.780]  and killing as much as possible.
[3:01:48.780 --> 3:01:52.780]  So that's what it is to be a man to these characters.
[3:01:52.780 --> 3:01:54.780]  They see the public really as it's.
[3:01:54.780 --> 3:01:56.780]  They don't see them as people anymore.
[3:01:56.780 --> 3:01:58.780]  Powerless.
[3:01:58.780 --> 3:01:59.780]  It's in us against them.
[3:01:59.780 --> 3:02:01.780]  They teach them we're a civilian scum.
[3:02:01.780 --> 3:02:04.780]  They're the godlike creatures that are doing all these bad things
[3:02:04.780 --> 3:02:06.780]  for their own safety and their brotherhood.
[3:02:06.780 --> 3:02:08.780]  But the brotherhood really is there to flush them down the toilet
[3:02:08.780 --> 3:02:11.780]  and the bankers are about to take their pension funds as well.
[3:02:11.780 --> 3:02:12.780]  Alan Watts, stay there.
[3:02:12.780 --> 3:02:14.780]  Phone calls straight ahead, right here on GCN
[3:02:14.780 --> 3:02:37.780]  and prisonplanet.tv.
[3:02:45.780 --> 3:02:49.780]  This money now owns the American and European banks.
[3:02:49.780 --> 3:02:51.780]  The exploding inflation that is now guaranteed
[3:02:51.780 --> 3:02:53.780]  will slash your life savings to nothing
[3:02:53.780 --> 3:02:55.780]  and blast the cost of necessities,
[3:02:55.780 --> 3:02:58.780]  particularly food beyond many Americans' reach.
[3:02:58.780 --> 3:03:00.780]  In pre-Nazi Germany's superinflation,
[3:03:00.780 --> 3:03:03.780]  the cost of a loaf of bread doubled every two days
[3:03:03.780 --> 3:03:05.780]  until it reached over 4 billion marks.
[3:03:05.780 --> 3:03:07.780]  Food prices are skyrocketing so fast,
[3:03:07.780 --> 3:03:10.780]  there seems as if there may be no end in sight.
[3:03:10.780 --> 3:03:12.780]  The private banks merging with our government
[3:03:12.780 --> 3:03:14.780]  are refusing to loan grocery stores enough money
[3:03:14.780 --> 3:03:15.780]  to restock their shelves.
[3:03:15.780 --> 3:03:18.780]  The stores have less food, but jack up prices to stay in business.
[3:03:18.780 --> 3:03:20.780]  Whatever happens in America,
[3:03:20.780 --> 3:03:22.780]  we need to be prepared and be ready.
[3:03:22.780 --> 3:03:24.780]  Everything is zeroing in on food.
[3:03:24.780 --> 3:03:26.780]  One-third of Americans have to choose between buying food
[3:03:26.780 --> 3:03:28.780]  and paying for other necessities.
[3:03:28.780 --> 3:03:30.780]  My friends, whatever it takes, get prepared,
[3:03:30.780 --> 3:03:32.780]  get self-sufficient, get food.
[3:03:32.780 --> 3:03:34.780]  For everybody out there listening,
[3:03:34.780 --> 3:03:36.780]  it's very important for you to understand that
[3:03:36.780 --> 3:03:38.780]  by having a supply of storable food, the government,
[3:03:38.780 --> 3:03:40.780]  the new old order has a lot less control over you
[3:03:40.780 --> 3:03:43.780]  and so it's a mindset, a mindset of self-sufficiency
[3:03:43.780 --> 3:03:44.780]  and preparedness.
[3:03:44.780 --> 3:03:46.780]  No one is going to take care of your family
[3:03:46.780 --> 3:03:47.780]  in the final equation but you.
[3:03:47.780 --> 3:03:49.780]  You know, eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship
[3:03:49.780 --> 3:03:51.780]  storable food that's safe from E. coli,
[3:03:51.780 --> 3:03:54.780]  salmonella genetic alteration, or Chinese imports,
[3:03:54.780 --> 3:03:56.780]  and they do it at almost half the cost
[3:03:56.780 --> 3:03:58.780]  of last year's grocery prices.
[3:03:58.780 --> 3:04:00.780]  Call 1-800-409-5633
[3:04:00.780 --> 3:04:02.780]  or on the web, go to eFoodsDirect.com.

[3:04:06.780 --> 3:04:09.780]  freeze-dried, and dehydrated foods they have to offer.

[3:04:12.780 --> 3:04:15.780]  at 1-800-409-5633.
[3:04:15.780 --> 3:04:17.780]  Again, 800-409-5633
[3:04:17.780 --> 3:04:20.780]  or on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[3:04:20.780 --> 3:04:21.780]  Take action today.
[3:04:21.780 --> 3:04:23.780]  The first step is getting storable food.
[3:04:25.780 --> 3:04:28.780]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[3:04:28.780 --> 3:04:31.780]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[3:04:35.780 --> 3:04:38.780]  We are back live with Alan Watt, our guest.
[3:04:38.780 --> 3:04:40.780]  I want to go ahead and go to your phone calls.
[3:04:40.780 --> 3:04:43.780]  First up is Matt in Iowa.
[3:04:43.780 --> 3:04:44.780]  Matt, thank you for holding.
[3:04:44.780 --> 3:04:46.780]  You're on the air worldwide.
[3:04:46.780 --> 3:04:47.780]  Go ahead.
[3:04:47.780 --> 3:04:48.780]  Hey, Alex.
[3:04:48.780 --> 3:04:50.780]  Thanks for taking my call.
[3:04:50.780 --> 3:04:52.780]  I just wanted to pass along to you.
[3:04:52.780 --> 3:04:54.780]  I don't know if you've seen you were talking about
[3:04:54.780 --> 3:04:57.780]  cops and other shows that kind of accustom people
[3:04:57.780 --> 3:05:03.780]  to presence of armed public servants, quote-unquote,
[3:05:03.780 --> 3:05:06.780]  in their lives, but I was watching ABC
[3:05:06.780 --> 3:05:10.780]  and this new show, Homeland Security, USA,
[3:05:10.780 --> 3:05:12.780]  is going to be on.
[3:05:12.780 --> 3:05:14.780]  Yeah, they're showing us who our new bosses are
[3:05:14.780 --> 3:05:16.780]  and how we're going to have national police
[3:05:16.780 --> 3:05:17.780]  with the military.
[3:05:17.780 --> 3:05:20.780]  And again, everybody they go after is always guilty
[3:05:20.780 --> 3:05:22.780]  in these made-for-TV shows and dramas
[3:05:22.780 --> 3:05:23.780]  and in real-life shows.
[3:05:23.780 --> 3:05:26.780]  There's a whole bunch of new Homeland Security shows,
[3:05:26.780 --> 3:05:27.780]  and it's come out.
[3:05:27.780 --> 3:05:29.780]  The federal government is funding and financing,
[3:05:29.780 --> 3:05:30.780]  but not just here.
[3:05:30.780 --> 3:05:33.780]  Governments worldwide are producing similar shows.
[3:05:33.780 --> 3:05:34.780]  Go ahead.
[3:05:34.780 --> 3:05:36.780]  Well, the other thing I wanted to talk about, too,
[3:05:36.780 --> 3:05:38.780]  was I was Christmas shopping the other day
[3:05:38.780 --> 3:05:40.780]  and there were these younger kids hanging out
[3:05:40.780 --> 3:05:43.780]  in the mall distributing Go Green bags,
[3:05:43.780 --> 3:05:44.780]  which is whatever.
[3:05:44.780 --> 3:05:47.780]  That's fine, giving out bags to reuse again.
[3:05:47.780 --> 3:05:50.780]  But on the side of it, it said Go Green underneath it
[3:05:50.780 --> 3:05:52.780]  was Midwest One Bank.
[3:05:52.780 --> 3:05:57.780]  And the O in the Go Green was scarily similar
[3:05:57.780 --> 3:06:02.780]  to the O of Obama's logo or whatever.
[3:06:02.780 --> 3:06:04.780]  No, they're going to have the environmental brigade,
[3:06:04.780 --> 3:06:06.780]  the youth brigade, the elderly brigades.
[3:06:06.780 --> 3:06:09.780]  And Obama's website said it will be compulsory
[3:06:09.780 --> 3:06:11.780]  for everybody to serve the government.
[3:06:11.780 --> 3:06:13.780]  And then his chief of staff has said that,
[3:06:13.780 --> 3:06:15.780]  written a book about it, Obama's giving speeches.
[3:06:15.780 --> 3:06:17.780]  And then when we made a big deal out of it,
[3:06:17.780 --> 3:06:18.780]  he pulled that off his website,
[3:06:18.780 --> 3:06:20.780]  but is going ahead with the programs.
[3:06:20.780 --> 3:06:22.780]  Alan, what comments on what he was talking about?
[3:06:22.780 --> 3:06:25.780]  Yeah, this whole system is guaranteed
[3:06:25.780 --> 3:06:27.780]  to be run under the guise of Greening.
[3:06:27.780 --> 3:06:31.780]  The Green Party was set up to actually start
[3:06:31.780 --> 3:06:33.780]  kickoff that whole agenda.
[3:06:33.780 --> 3:06:35.780]  And that will be the big stick.
[3:06:35.780 --> 3:06:38.780]  To do with repopulation is part of it.
[3:06:38.780 --> 3:06:40.780]  To keep hammering, there's too many of us.
[3:06:40.780 --> 3:06:43.780]  We can't go on with unrestricted consumption,
[3:06:43.780 --> 3:06:45.780]  sustainability.
[3:06:45.780 --> 3:06:47.780]  It's in every single speech they're making
[3:06:47.780 --> 3:06:49.780]  from every quarter, from every country.
[3:06:49.780 --> 3:06:52.780]  And so that's been hammered into general population
[3:06:52.780 --> 3:06:55.780]  that we are responsible for at the terrible state
[3:06:55.780 --> 3:06:56.780]  of the world.
[3:06:56.780 --> 3:06:58.780]  And it's all our fault.
[3:06:58.780 --> 3:07:01.780]  And we've got to start cutting our numbers drastically
[3:07:01.780 --> 3:07:03.780]  and stop consuming the way we are.
[3:07:03.780 --> 3:07:05.780]  We've got to remember, too, that Bertrand Russell,
[3:07:05.780 --> 3:07:08.780]  who only gave out everything that he learned
[3:07:08.780 --> 3:07:10.780]  from the big world meetings he attended,
[3:07:10.780 --> 3:07:12.780]  the big think tanks that planned all this,
[3:07:12.780 --> 3:07:15.780]  he said, eventually, they'd have to create
[3:07:15.780 --> 3:07:17.780]  some kind of situation where, eventually,
[3:07:17.780 --> 3:07:20.780]  governments would dish out credits instead of money.
[3:07:20.780 --> 3:07:23.780]  And so the bank would be run through the governments,
[3:07:23.780 --> 3:07:25.780]  through the people themselves individually.
[3:07:25.780 --> 3:07:27.780]  So we'll all be issued with credits.
[3:07:27.780 --> 3:07:30.780]  These guys have planned this for a long, long time.
[3:07:30.780 --> 3:07:32.780]  We're simply going through the script right now.
[3:07:32.780 --> 3:07:35.780]  Now, to be clear, you said this, I've said this,
[3:07:35.780 --> 3:07:37.780]  we're only reading government documents,
[3:07:37.780 --> 3:07:39.780]  what they've been quietly planning.
[3:07:39.780 --> 3:07:40.780]  Now they're unveiling it.
[3:07:40.780 --> 3:07:43.780]  The private banks come in, issue all this liquidity,
[3:07:43.780 --> 3:07:46.780]  infect all the stocks, the bonds, the mutual funds,
[3:07:46.780 --> 3:07:48.780]  the 401ks, the pensions, the government,
[3:07:48.780 --> 3:07:51.780]  pensions, fire, police, teachers.
[3:07:51.780 --> 3:07:53.780]  They set all this up.
[3:07:53.780 --> 3:07:55.780]  Then they implode the economy.
[3:07:55.780 --> 3:07:57.780]  They come in as the savior, and they say,
[3:07:57.780 --> 3:07:59.780]  the new model is you'll pay your taxes
[3:07:59.780 --> 3:08:01.780]  directly to the IMF and World Bank.
[3:08:01.780 --> 3:08:03.780]  And now suddenly, the last few years,
[3:08:03.780 --> 3:08:06.780]  you don't fill out your income tax to the ex-checker.
[3:08:06.780 --> 3:08:08.780]  You don't fill out your income tax
[3:08:08.780 --> 3:08:10.780]  in the United States to the IRS.
[3:08:10.780 --> 3:08:12.780]  Now it's to the Federal Reserve.
[3:08:12.780 --> 3:08:14.780]  It's now to the private bank of England.
[3:08:14.780 --> 3:08:16.780]  And then last week in the New York Times
[3:08:16.780 --> 3:08:18.780]  and a bunch of other publications,
[3:08:18.780 --> 3:08:21.780]  all on the same day simultaneously, they announced,
[3:08:21.780 --> 3:08:25.780]  well, we're going to go ahead and probably bankrupt U.S. T-bills
[3:08:25.780 --> 3:08:26.780]  and bonds.
[3:08:26.780 --> 3:08:28.780]  We're blowing that out worldwide.
[3:08:28.780 --> 3:08:31.780]  You'll now buy your securities that have,
[3:08:31.780 --> 3:08:33.780]  quote, government backing by taxpayers
[3:08:33.780 --> 3:08:36.780]  directly from the private Federal Reserve.
[3:08:36.780 --> 3:08:39.780]  So your World ID card with your credits on it,
[3:08:39.780 --> 3:08:42.780]  and people are trying to buy cash, headlights, batteries,
[3:08:42.780 --> 3:08:45.780]  toothpaste, everywhere they're demanding now,
[3:08:45.780 --> 3:08:47.780]  even with a $5 purchase, hey,
[3:08:47.780 --> 3:08:49.780]  you've got to give me your name and number.
[3:08:49.780 --> 3:08:51.780]  You're ready for the cashless society
[3:08:51.780 --> 3:08:53.780]  to destroy the underground economy
[3:08:53.780 --> 3:08:55.780]  because they'll say, wait a minute,
[3:08:55.780 --> 3:08:57.780]  you've bought more than what your paycheck says.
[3:08:57.780 --> 3:08:59.780]  You must be doing underground barter.
[3:08:59.780 --> 3:09:01.780]  And that's why they want to tax the web,
[3:09:01.780 --> 3:09:03.780]  and they're now announcing that.
[3:09:03.780 --> 3:09:05.780]  So it's all coming into fruition.
[3:09:05.780 --> 3:09:07.780]  And then I just posted up on the screen,
[3:09:07.780 --> 3:09:09.780]  the Kurt Nemo article, Democrats determined
[3:09:09.780 --> 3:09:11.780]  to reimpose fairness doctrine.
[3:09:11.780 --> 3:09:13.780]  Look at that Orwellian term.
[3:09:13.780 --> 3:09:15.780]  It's like the Patriot Act or the New Freedom Initiative,
[3:09:15.780 --> 3:09:17.780]  all taking your freedom.
[3:09:17.780 --> 3:09:19.780]  Alto is reporting what Congress is saying
[3:09:19.780 --> 3:09:21.780]  they do intend to restrict free speech
[3:09:21.780 --> 3:09:24.780]  on internet radio, AM and FM, everything.
[3:09:24.780 --> 3:09:27.780]  The FCC announcing they will control, quote,
[3:09:27.780 --> 3:09:29.780]  speech on the internet. Alan Watt.
[3:09:29.780 --> 3:09:30.780]  Yeah, that's true.
[3:09:30.780 --> 3:09:32.780]  And even Google and all the big boys
[3:09:32.780 --> 3:09:34.780]  have come out with their main servers saying
[3:09:34.780 --> 3:09:37.780]  they're now going to see who will be pushed on the web
[3:09:37.780 --> 3:09:39.780]  and all the different search engines
[3:09:39.780 --> 3:09:41.780]  and who they will restrict.
[3:09:41.780 --> 3:09:43.780]  So this is the censorship already here.
[3:09:43.780 --> 3:09:45.780]  But you're right to do with purchasing
[3:09:45.780 --> 3:09:47.780]  10 years ago in Canada and most countries
[3:09:47.780 --> 3:09:49.780]  across Europe, too.
[3:09:49.780 --> 3:09:51.780]  Suddenly if you bought tires for your car,
[3:09:51.780 --> 3:09:53.780]  they would want your full name and address and so on.
[3:09:53.780 --> 3:09:55.780]  And now they want to know your vehicle.
[3:09:55.780 --> 3:09:57.780]  And I asked a guy in the stories,
[3:09:57.780 --> 3:09:59.780]  he says, yeah, it's actually the law.
[3:09:59.780 --> 3:10:01.780]  He showed me it on the computer.
[3:10:01.780 --> 3:10:03.780]  It is the law that they must find out
[3:10:03.780 --> 3:10:05.780]  what car you have, this registration number
[3:10:05.780 --> 3:10:07.780]  and everything before you can buy tires.
[3:10:07.780 --> 3:10:09.780]  Amazing. Again, punch up on screen, guys,
[3:10:09.780 --> 3:10:11.780]  this article that I put up here.
[3:10:11.780 --> 3:10:14.780]  Democrats determined to reimpose fairness doctrine.
[3:10:14.780 --> 3:10:16.780]  Going back to the caller,
[3:10:16.780 --> 3:10:18.780]  did you have anything else you wanted to add, sir?
[3:10:18.780 --> 3:10:20.780]  Yeah, I was just going to...
[3:10:20.780 --> 3:10:22.780]  I was wondering if you guys think that
[3:10:22.780 --> 3:10:24.780]  Homeland Security is synonymous with
[3:10:24.780 --> 3:10:26.780]  Gestapo or if Obama is always
[3:10:26.780 --> 3:10:28.780]  synonymous with
[3:10:28.780 --> 3:10:30.780]  the very swastika.
[3:10:30.780 --> 3:10:32.780]  Was that embraced like
[3:10:32.780 --> 3:10:34.780]  Obama's being embraced
[3:10:34.780 --> 3:10:36.780]  in pre-Nazi Germany?
[3:10:36.780 --> 3:10:38.780]  Well, yes, we're having the same fascistic,
[3:10:38.780 --> 3:10:40.780]  basic symbols,
[3:10:40.780 --> 3:10:42.780]  basic tribalism.
[3:10:42.780 --> 3:10:44.780]  They're bringing us into the crisis
[3:10:44.780 --> 3:10:46.780]  and the message is in the media,
[3:10:46.780 --> 3:10:48.780]  Obama is your savior.
[3:10:48.780 --> 3:10:50.780]  Just put your trust in him.
[3:10:50.780 --> 3:10:52.780]  When he was the biggest cheerleader
[3:10:52.780 --> 3:10:54.780]  for the banker, take over.
[3:10:54.780 --> 3:10:56.780]  But then I hear the Democrats say,
[3:10:56.780 --> 3:10:58.780]  no, he will save us from the evil bankers.
[3:10:58.780 --> 3:11:00.780]  Alan, what?
[3:11:00.780 --> 3:11:02.780]  Yeah, it is true, too.
[3:11:02.780 --> 3:11:04.780]  In his speech at the end of the election,
[3:11:04.780 --> 3:11:06.780]  he wore the red and white
[3:11:06.780 --> 3:11:08.780]  and black tie. His wife wore red and black.
[3:11:08.780 --> 3:11:10.780]  And that's the colors of
[3:11:10.780 --> 3:11:12.780]  socialism.
[3:11:12.780 --> 3:11:14.780]  But it can't be Nazism, because he's a black guy.
[3:11:14.780 --> 3:11:16.780]  No, it's the corporate fascist model.
[3:11:16.780 --> 3:11:18.780]  It's the corporate fascist model.
[3:11:18.780 --> 3:11:20.780]  And it can come
[3:11:20.780 --> 3:11:22.780]  in idiomine, it can come under Hitler.
[3:11:22.780 --> 3:11:24.780]  Go ahead, Alan, you're making a point.
[3:11:24.780 --> 3:11:26.780]  Yeah, they'd love to show you
[3:11:26.780 --> 3:11:28.780]  their agenda right in your face, knowing it.
[3:11:28.780 --> 3:11:30.780]  It's like the Mason's say, we never speak so openly.
[3:11:30.780 --> 3:11:32.780]  It's what we do in public. The public never understand it.
[3:11:32.780 --> 3:11:34.780]  But they're really hearing or
[3:11:34.780 --> 3:11:36.780]  seeing either. But they do show you
[3:11:36.780 --> 3:11:38.780]  the symbols and colors. This is all
[3:11:38.780 --> 3:11:40.780]  Korean, the color coding and so on.
[3:11:40.780 --> 3:11:42.780]  It was back for thousands of years.
[3:11:42.780 --> 3:11:44.780]  But they do go along with this and you have to
[3:11:44.780 --> 3:11:46.780]  go into Obama's mother to find out
[3:11:46.780 --> 3:11:48.780]  why she was raised, what she was trained for
[3:11:48.780 --> 3:11:50.780]  and you'll find that she was trained to be
[3:11:50.780 --> 3:11:52.780]  a world revolutionary and
[3:11:52.780 --> 3:11:54.780]  actually to literally breed
[3:11:54.780 --> 3:11:56.780]  an offspring to be the president one day.
[3:11:56.780 --> 3:11:58.780]  All right, Matt, thank you for the call.
[3:11:58.780 --> 3:12:00.780]  Let's go ahead
[3:12:00.780 --> 3:12:02.780]  and talk to Chris in Arizona.
[3:12:02.780 --> 3:12:04.780]  Chris, go ahead, you're on the air.
[3:12:04.780 --> 3:12:06.780]  Hello? Yes.
[3:12:06.780 --> 3:12:08.780]  Yes, Alex.
[3:12:08.780 --> 3:12:10.780]  I've been listening for about
[3:12:10.780 --> 3:12:12.780]  since 2005.
[3:12:12.780 --> 3:12:14.780]  I was over in Kuwait
[3:12:14.780 --> 3:12:16.780]  for a year and one of my
[3:12:16.780 --> 3:12:18.780]  friends, he's a
[3:12:18.780 --> 3:12:20.780]  Iraq vet. He woke me up
[3:12:20.780 --> 3:12:22.780]  to this stuff. I didn't want to believe it at first,
[3:12:22.780 --> 3:12:24.780]  but I've been listening to your
[3:12:24.780 --> 3:12:26.780]  radio show and I got a lot of your videos
[3:12:26.780 --> 3:12:28.780]  and they really woke me up
[3:12:28.780 --> 3:12:30.780]  and
[3:12:30.780 --> 3:12:32.780]  I just want to thank you for that.
[3:12:32.780 --> 3:12:34.780]  First of all,
[3:12:34.780 --> 3:12:36.780]  don't thank me, sir.
[3:12:36.780 --> 3:12:38.780]  My family, myself, your family,
[3:12:38.780 --> 3:12:40.780]  Alan,
[3:12:40.780 --> 3:12:42.780]  none of us have any future if these
[3:12:42.780 --> 3:12:44.780]  social engineers, these mad men, these
[3:12:44.780 --> 3:12:46.780]  control freaks, these
[3:12:46.780 --> 3:12:48.780]  hyper-dominant people that want to
[3:12:48.780 --> 3:12:50.780]  literally kill us, an engineer
[3:12:50.780 --> 3:12:52.780]  who's left, you know, either they're
[3:12:52.780 --> 3:12:54.780]  defeated or we're destroyed and
[3:12:54.780 --> 3:12:56.780]  so don't thank me. I thank God
[3:12:56.780 --> 3:12:58.780]  you woke up. Thank God something in your
[3:12:58.780 --> 3:13:00.780]  background let you break your conditioning
[3:13:00.780 --> 3:13:02.780]  in the false paradigm you were in.
[3:13:02.780 --> 3:13:04.780]  I'm doing or thank Alan or thank others.
[3:13:04.780 --> 3:13:06.780]  Listen, we are
[3:13:06.780 --> 3:13:08.780]  we are only doing what a normal person
[3:13:08.780 --> 3:13:10.780]  historically would do
[3:13:10.780 --> 3:13:12.780]  when faced with this type of attack. I mean, when the
[3:13:12.780 --> 3:13:14.780]  globalists openly announce, they're waging war
[3:13:14.780 --> 3:13:16.780]  against humanity. All I
[3:13:16.780 --> 3:13:18.780]  can do is fight back against them. Alan?
[3:13:18.780 --> 3:13:20.780]  We have no choice in the matter.
[3:13:20.780 --> 3:13:22.780]  If you truly understand what's happening,
[3:13:22.780 --> 3:13:24.780]  you have no choice. You cannot
[3:13:24.780 --> 3:13:26.780]  sit with the knowledge. It'll kill
[3:13:26.780 --> 3:13:28.780]  you otherwise. You have to get it out there.
[3:13:28.780 --> 3:13:30.780]  Absolutely. Anything else, sir?
[3:13:30.780 --> 3:13:32.780]  Well, I just
[3:13:32.780 --> 3:13:34.780]  one of the
[3:13:34.780 --> 3:13:36.780]  one of my friends I work with, he just
[3:13:36.780 --> 3:13:38.780]  bought a firearm and it was
[3:13:38.780 --> 3:13:40.780]  one of those big
[3:13:40.780 --> 3:13:42.780]  Desert Eagle 50s, you know,
[3:13:42.780 --> 3:13:44.780]  and he told me about like
[3:13:44.780 --> 3:13:46.780]  next year, the 2009 models
[3:13:46.780 --> 3:13:48.780]  are going to have GPS's in them.
[3:13:48.780 --> 3:13:50.780]  Yes. Everything is RFID
[3:13:50.780 --> 3:13:52.780]  in the guns. Everything is
[3:13:52.780 --> 3:13:54.780]  under Schwarzenegger marking
[3:13:54.780 --> 3:13:56.780]  the shell casing. That will then force
[3:13:56.780 --> 3:13:58.780]  adoption of that nationwide and worldwide.
[3:13:58.780 --> 3:14:00.780]  It's all happening.
[3:14:00.780 --> 3:14:02.780]  They're coming for the guns and
[3:14:02.780 --> 3:14:04.780]  people think that's just some archetypal thing I say.
[3:14:04.780 --> 3:14:06.780]  The troops are openly been training
[3:14:06.780 --> 3:14:08.780]  for decades to door to door, shut
[3:14:08.780 --> 3:14:10.780]  off the food and water and then 99%
[3:14:10.780 --> 3:14:12.780]  of people on average, they believe
[3:14:12.780 --> 3:14:14.780]  I don't believe that's accurate, more like 90%
[3:14:14.780 --> 3:14:16.780]  will turn their guns in. Then they'll go after
[3:14:16.780 --> 3:14:18.780]  the rest of the people. They know who's got
[3:14:18.780 --> 3:14:20.780]  guns. It is registration. When you
[3:14:20.780 --> 3:14:22.780]  fill out the yellow form, it's long gun
[3:14:22.780 --> 3:14:24.780]  shotgun or handgun and
[3:14:24.780 --> 3:14:26.780]  it's now being prepared.
[3:14:26.780 --> 3:14:28.780]  The good news is, though, Alan, and I appreciate
[3:14:28.780 --> 3:14:30.780]  your call, sir, the good news is
[3:14:30.780 --> 3:14:32.780]  that people have bought
[3:14:32.780 --> 3:14:34.780]  the gun stores bare. The ammo has basically
[3:14:34.780 --> 3:14:36.780]  been sold out. Record gun purchases
[3:14:36.780 --> 3:14:38.780]  that shows and then Obama comes out and says
[3:14:38.780 --> 3:14:40.780]  don't worry, I only want to ban some of your guns
[3:14:40.780 --> 3:14:42.780]  and restrict some of them. Stop buying guns
[3:14:42.780 --> 3:14:44.780]  and the BATF is now harassing
[3:14:44.780 --> 3:14:46.780]  gun dealers and trying to get on the local news
[3:14:46.780 --> 3:14:48.780]  telling people don't buy guns.
[3:14:48.780 --> 3:14:50.780]  So it doesn't seem like things are working for them, Alan.
[3:14:50.780 --> 3:14:52.780]  Yeah, they do expect trouble.
[3:14:52.780 --> 3:14:54.780]  They do expect the problems
[3:14:54.780 --> 3:14:56.780]  of what they're hoping for
[3:14:56.780 --> 3:14:58.780]  and I don't think they're even hoping for it.
[3:14:58.780 --> 3:15:00.780]  They've got it set up already
[3:15:00.780 --> 3:15:02.780]  that this rapid reaction force
[3:15:02.780 --> 3:15:04.780]  will be pulled in from other countries
[3:15:04.780 --> 3:15:06.780]  to deal. They don't want to turn.
[3:15:06.780 --> 3:15:08.780]  They know that there's going to be a problem down
[3:15:08.780 --> 3:15:10.780]  the road if their own people,
[3:15:10.780 --> 3:15:12.780]  if your own American soldiers start
[3:15:12.780 --> 3:15:14.780]  killing Americans. Eventually
[3:15:14.780 --> 3:15:16.780]  they get to a stage and they found this in
[3:15:16.780 --> 3:15:18.780]  Nazi Germany during the firing
[3:15:18.780 --> 3:15:20.780]  squads. They get to a stage where the guys
[3:15:20.780 --> 3:15:22.780]  who are killing their own people
[3:15:22.780 --> 3:15:24.780]  start to break down.
[3:15:24.780 --> 3:15:26.780]  So they prefer to bring in foreign troops to do it.
[3:15:26.780 --> 3:15:28.780]  And that's what the whole international
[3:15:28.780 --> 3:15:30.780]  rapid reaction forces are all about.
[3:15:30.780 --> 3:15:32.780]  The same thing happened in Beijing.
[3:15:32.780 --> 3:15:34.780]  China didn't bring in the usual Chinese
[3:15:34.780 --> 3:15:36.780]  soldiers. They brought in the ones from the far north
[3:15:36.780 --> 3:15:38.780]  Mongolian types and they had
[3:15:38.780 --> 3:15:40.780]  little in common with the average Chinese
[3:15:40.780 --> 3:15:42.780]  and had no problem killing them.
[3:15:42.780 --> 3:15:44.780]  Well, they did that in Poland. They'd bring people from the east to the west
[3:15:44.780 --> 3:15:46.780]  and the north to the south.
[3:15:46.780 --> 3:15:48.780]  And for those that don't know, when we come back
[3:15:48.780 --> 3:15:50.780]  I'm going to briefly list all the mainstream news,
[3:15:50.780 --> 3:15:52.780]  especially on the British.
[3:15:52.780 --> 3:15:54.780]  Major war college reports.
[3:15:54.780 --> 3:15:56.780]  The biggest army recruiting centers and marine
[3:15:56.780 --> 3:15:58.780]  centers are in Mexico. They're in
[3:15:58.780 --> 3:16:00.780]  the Eastern Europe. They're in the Philippines.
[3:16:00.780 --> 3:16:02.780]  So already in our militaries
[3:16:02.780 --> 3:16:04.780]  a bunch of foreigners. They're also hiring
[3:16:04.780 --> 3:16:06.780]  violent felons, foreigners who are aggravated
[3:16:06.780 --> 3:16:08.780]  felons for the military. That's
[3:16:08.780 --> 3:16:10.780]  Washington Times, Washington Post, both telling you how great it is.
[3:16:10.780 --> 3:16:12.780]  They've also signed a deal
[3:16:12.780 --> 3:16:14.780]  to use Canadian and Mexican troops in the United States.
[3:16:14.780 --> 3:16:16.780]  That's been in the Toronto Star and other publications.
[3:16:16.780 --> 3:16:18.780]  Congress said, hey, we weren't consulted
[3:16:18.780 --> 3:16:20.780]  earlier this year and they were told shut up
[3:16:20.780 --> 3:16:22.780]  by Northcom. So they do have foreign troops
[3:16:22.780 --> 3:16:24.780]  ready to come. Take your guns
[3:16:24.780 --> 3:16:26.780]  and rape and kill you.
[3:16:26.780 --> 3:16:28.780]  May I have everybody's attention, please?
[3:16:28.780 --> 3:16:30.780]  I've come with a message of information.
[3:16:30.780 --> 3:16:32.780]  9-11 was an inside job.
[3:16:32.780 --> 3:16:34.780]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[3:16:34.780 --> 3:16:36.780]  Do you like being a puppet from the New World Order?
[3:16:36.780 --> 3:16:38.780]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a state?
[3:16:38.780 --> 3:16:40.780]  It was engineered by you, David Rockefeller,
[3:16:40.780 --> 3:16:42.780]  the Thrallateral Commission, the C.F.R.,
[3:16:42.780 --> 3:16:44.780]  the U.S. sedans.
[3:16:44.780 --> 3:16:46.780]  A day that we stop asking questions
[3:16:46.780 --> 3:16:48.780]  is the day that we have allowed
[3:16:48.780 --> 3:16:50.780]  the seeds of despotism to grow
[3:16:50.780 --> 3:16:52.780]  at our own door.
[3:16:52.780 --> 3:16:54.780]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11,
[3:16:54.780 --> 3:16:56.780]  a global awakening has taken place.
[3:16:56.780 --> 3:16:58.780]  An inside job?
[3:16:58.780 --> 3:17:00.780]  How dare you?
[3:17:00.780 --> 3:17:02.780]  I don't think about the topics
[3:17:02.780 --> 3:17:04.780]  suggested in 9-11.
[3:17:04.780 --> 3:17:06.780]  If you know that there's treason going on,
[3:17:06.780 --> 3:17:08.780]  you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[3:17:08.780 --> 3:17:10.780]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[3:17:10.780 --> 3:17:12.780]  And if the government has not told the truth
[3:17:12.780 --> 3:17:14.780]  in five years, we will be here
[3:17:14.780 --> 3:17:16.780]  for the 10th anniversary of 9-11.
[3:17:16.780 --> 3:17:18.780]  Truth rising.
[3:17:18.780 --> 3:17:20.780]  Download the film at prisonplanet.tv right now
[3:17:20.780 --> 3:17:22.780]  or get the DVD at infowars.com.
[3:17:22.780 --> 3:17:24.780]  It's now time to take the revolution
[3:17:24.780 --> 3:17:26.780]  at the next level.
[3:17:26.780 --> 3:17:28.780]  The United States seems to be celebrating
[3:17:28.780 --> 3:17:30.780]  over its triumph of reducing government debt.
[3:17:30.780 --> 3:17:32.780]  But the truth be told, public and private debt
[3:17:32.780 --> 3:17:34.780]  increased to a record high in 1999,
[3:17:34.780 --> 3:17:36.780]  reaching a peak of $14.8 trillion,
[3:17:36.780 --> 3:17:38.780]  marking 10.57%
[3:17:38.780 --> 3:17:40.780]  annual increase outpacing
[3:17:40.780 --> 3:17:42.780]  its previous 10 years.
[3:17:42.780 --> 3:17:44.780]  The US economy receives its currency
[3:17:44.780 --> 3:17:46.780]  by taking on debt through private banking institution
[3:17:46.780 --> 3:17:48.780]  called the Federal Reserve System.
[3:17:48.780 --> 3:17:50.780]  In the year 2000, debt growth
[3:17:50.780 --> 3:17:52.780]  collapsed to only 4.5%.
[3:17:52.780 --> 3:17:54.780]  It's bad enough that the US citizens
[3:17:54.780 --> 3:17:56.780]  is bound by debt in order to have commerce.
[3:17:56.780 --> 3:17:58.780]  However, shocking the economy
[3:17:58.780 --> 3:18:00.780]  with the reduction of this magnitude
[3:18:00.780 --> 3:18:02.780]  could wipe out years of growth in a stock portfolio.

[3:18:14.780 --> 3:18:16.780]  how recession and depression are driven

[3:20:28.900 --> 3:20:33.300]  I've played this quite a few times, but the next segment I'm going to play it and watch
[3:20:33.300 --> 3:20:39.860]  take on it. There's a bunch of video games out in the last decade like Shattered Union.
[3:20:39.860 --> 3:20:44.460]  And in some of these games your job, you work for the Illuminati, for the world government
[3:20:44.460 --> 3:20:50.340]  you hunt down and kill militias. You torture militia members to death. In one game when
[3:20:50.340 --> 3:20:55.100]  you get to the final level you get into a safe and you know at the top of the Illuminati
[3:20:55.100 --> 3:21:01.860]  and one of my videos, Police State 2000 is the great secret inside of the safe. I don't
[3:21:01.860 --> 3:21:09.140]  know why the establishment does that or why they keep sticking my voice or my rants in
[3:21:09.140 --> 3:21:15.620]  video games and in some cases without my permission. And then one time they went to the network
[3:21:15.620 --> 3:21:19.500]  and got the rights I think for like 300 bucks to put me in one. But the point is we'll get
[3:21:19.500 --> 3:21:23.380]  Alan's take on why that's happening. Right now let's go back to the calls. Brian in Canada
[3:21:23.380 --> 3:21:25.580]  you're on the air with Alan Watt.
[3:21:25.580 --> 3:21:26.580]  Hi.
[3:21:26.580 --> 3:21:27.580]  Hello.
[3:21:27.580 --> 3:21:28.580]  How are you?
[3:21:28.580 --> 3:21:29.580]  Pretty good.
[3:21:29.580 --> 3:21:34.340]  I'd like to thank you Alex. I know what you said before but even though I was aware like
[3:21:34.340 --> 3:21:39.380]  a deer that knew it was hunting season it wasn't until you led me in the right direction
[3:21:39.380 --> 3:21:45.500]  in 2005 that I started to make some sense of my life. Today I was calling me. I did want
[3:21:45.500 --> 3:21:50.500]  to talk about my Prime Minister puppet and cell phones and things like that but I noticed
[3:21:50.500 --> 3:21:55.300]  that there's a lie being propounded out there and there's a chance that even our side of
[3:21:55.300 --> 3:22:01.180]  truthers might buy into that lie. And that lie would be that this is the first time that
[3:22:01.180 --> 3:22:06.500]  there's a one world power. I'm getting kind of tired of reminding people and asking them
[3:22:06.500 --> 3:22:12.140]  if they've ever heard of a little place called Babel and a little guy called Nimrod because
[3:22:12.140 --> 3:22:19.140]  that was actually the first global world power. And at that time he had one language. He probably
[3:22:19.140 --> 3:22:24.300]  had everybody compartmentalized the way they do it now too but there was only one language
[3:22:24.300 --> 3:22:28.620]  and when God came down and messed them up well all the different languages went off
[3:22:28.620 --> 3:22:33.340]  with all their little pieces of what to do. Yeah that story is of the system breaking
[3:22:33.340 --> 3:22:38.900]  apart that global empire and then the Romans and then the Roman Catholic Church and the
[3:22:38.900 --> 3:22:43.340]  British Empire. Well they believe that this is what's led us to this. He had to go out
[3:22:43.340 --> 3:22:48.220]  across the world to get back all of his little recipe books of how to get back this one world
[3:22:48.220 --> 3:22:53.060]  power and that's why he's on this break next speed to get it done now because he's never
[3:22:53.060 --> 3:22:56.780]  been so close as he's been now. All right let me get Alan's take on that because he's
[3:22:56.780 --> 3:23:05.100]  our guest. Go ahead Alan Watt. The symbol of Nimrod is that it's world power. Nimrod
[3:23:05.100 --> 3:23:12.500]  is also the same as Satan really in the ancient literature and his wife as well as being the
[3:23:12.500 --> 3:23:18.180]  ultimate rebels who swore that they would rise higher than all the gods and dominate
[3:23:18.180 --> 3:23:25.140]  the universe basically. So it's the same old power elite idea of the psychopath who's
[3:23:25.140 --> 3:23:29.180]  a megalomaniac and who truly believes he has the right to dominate the whole planet. And
[3:23:29.180 --> 3:23:34.940]  it's not just dominate creation in the fellow humans. They state that they want to make
[3:23:34.940 --> 3:23:40.180]  war on the heavens. They want to become gods and whether you believe it or not they do
[3:23:40.180 --> 3:23:43.020]  and my parents were just over in Germany last year and they took back all this video and
[3:23:43.020 --> 3:23:47.700]  showed me of where the Germans even during World War II built a big armored dome over
[3:23:47.700 --> 3:23:54.260]  Ishtar's gate and the seat of Satan from where Babylon was in Iraq and that Hitler believed
[3:23:54.260 --> 3:23:59.460]  he was invincible because he had the seat of Satan. Yes that is true. Hitler did have
[3:23:59.460 --> 3:24:05.780]  his own special mediums. He was into the New Age. He was a theosophist. Theosophy is the
[3:24:05.780 --> 3:24:13.620]  same philosophy as the elite all believe and Rockefeller himself sponsored the main magazine
[3:24:13.620 --> 3:24:21.900]  for the Lucifer Trust. And Lucifer to them of course is the epitome of the ideal intellectualized
[3:24:21.900 --> 3:24:28.740]  Superman to come. They believe they're the pro-generators of the Superman to come.
[3:24:28.740 --> 3:24:34.780]  But they have to destroy this creation to build their new creation. Finishing up caller
[3:24:34.780 --> 3:24:40.340]  Brian in Canada with your point about your puppet Stephen Harper suspending parliament
[3:24:40.340 --> 3:24:46.580]  with the Queen twice. Yeah and that too even though he suspends parliament he still has
[3:24:46.580 --> 3:24:51.140]  dictatorial powers during that period. Apparently they didn't know that either. And we're seeing
[3:24:51.140 --> 3:24:55.100]  this all over the world. Anything else Brian. Yeah I was just saying that that drove me
[3:24:55.100 --> 3:25:00.460]  nuts up here because even exposed himself in front of all of us. I was here the first
[3:25:00.460 --> 3:25:05.900]  few days that he called the election. The American market was crashing every day and
[3:25:05.900 --> 3:25:09.940]  the news would start to pressure him like what about this. And the first few days he
[3:25:09.940 --> 3:25:14.780]  got very mad and adamant and said Canada is not the United States and we're not going
[3:25:14.780 --> 3:25:19.700]  to suffer the same thing as them. And then four days later when our economists started
[3:25:19.700 --> 3:25:24.180]  coming out saying yes Mr. Harper we are going to suffer. Then he stood in front of the news
[3:25:24.180 --> 3:25:28.860]  and he stated that they knew about this 15 months ago and started taking measures. Well
[3:25:28.860 --> 3:25:34.260]  I mean right there he exposed himself. Allen why is he in your papers today saying there's
[3:25:34.260 --> 3:25:38.980]  going to be a depression. Well he waits for his lines. He's a bit behind the times that
[3:25:38.980 --> 3:25:43.860]  he waits for his lines being sent to him from London. You understand that Canada is still
[3:25:43.860 --> 3:25:48.100]  part of the British Commonwealth. Not one law gets passed in Canada without the Queen's
[3:25:48.100 --> 3:25:55.140]  signature. So even they call it democracy. So he waits for his orders and he shifts accordingly
[3:25:55.140 --> 3:26:00.260]  according to the mood of the people. So he that's what he's told. He's a puppet for
[3:26:00.260 --> 3:26:02.980]  sure. All right Brian thanks for the call. More
[3:26:02.980 --> 3:26:07.060]  calls straight ahead and the shattered union clip when I come out of break. Not just the

[3:27:25.660 --> 3:27:31.260]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against
[3:27:31.260 --> 3:27:37.620]  this country. The enemy struck America on September 11th. Who is the enemy? Bin Laden. This is
[3:27:37.620 --> 3:27:42.260]  M.O. We have to look to the Middle East. We have to look to Osama bin Laden. Fabled Enemies

[3:27:46.900 --> 3:27:51.980]  inside the United States. Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis again very
[3:27:51.980 --> 3:27:58.460]  much engaged in spying in and on the U.S. I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been
[3:27:58.460 --> 3:28:03.580]  detained. Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers' ties to the FBI, the Saudi
[3:28:03.580 --> 3:28:07.780]  Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings in war games, the shadow
[3:28:07.780 --> 3:28:14.100]  government and much, much more. Fabled Enemies. Get the DVD at infowars.com or see it in super

[3:13:05.360 --> 3:29:56.620]  I have great hopes and dreams for my progeny. Living with your progeny in
[3:29:56.620 --> 3:30:02.820]  the future. I know I'm part of a great cycle of life on a beautiful planet hurtling through
[3:30:02.820 --> 3:30:09.340]  space and I want to stop the greedy controlling covetous new world order control freaks that
[3:30:09.340 --> 3:30:16.000]  are so greedy they want to control the future and shapes humanity in their degradated degenerate
[3:30:16.000 --> 3:30:21.120]  image. That's the basic psychology we're dealing with. I want to punch up on screen
[3:30:21.120 --> 3:30:24.240]  and we're gonna go back to Alan Watt. I want to get his take on this. This is the
[3:30:24.240 --> 3:30:28.840]  trailer of one of, it's got to be more than a hundred games, that push. We're
[3:30:28.840 --> 3:30:32.360]  gonna have martial law, things are gonna break down, it's cute and funny and we're
[3:30:32.360 --> 3:30:36.480]  looking forward to it. This is all part of the acclamation. Here it is, shattered
[3:30:36.480 --> 3:30:41.920]  union. A disputed election and a tie vote. The US Congress installs the most
[3:30:41.920 --> 3:30:46.780]  unpopular president in US history as David Jefferson Adams becomes the
[3:30:46.780 --> 3:30:51.320]  44th president of the United States. Shortly after the election, increased
[3:30:51.320 --> 3:30:55.680]  unrest, rioting and a growing number of militias have given rise to ever
[3:30:55.680 --> 3:31:01.080]  increasing domestic terrorism. In response, the president invokes the
[3:31:01.080 --> 3:31:05.440]  Homeland Security Act and declares martial law on the West Coast and other
[3:31:05.440 --> 3:31:10.000]  areas of the country. Though highly contested, a Supreme Court ruling
[3:31:10.000 --> 3:31:13.840]  sidesteps the electoral process, disqualifying popular presidential
[3:31:13.840 --> 3:31:19.120]  candidates from several states. Public outrage explodes when a sham election
[3:31:19.120 --> 3:31:25.960]  leads to incumbent David Adams accepting a second term in office. During the
[3:31:25.960 --> 3:31:31.040]  57th Inauguration Day ceremonies, Washington DC is drug by a low yield
[3:31:31.040 --> 3:31:38.200]  nuclear weapon killing David Adams and most of the US Congress. The destruction
[3:31:38.200 --> 3:31:43.120]  of Washington DC effectively breaks the chain of succession, sending the nation
[3:31:43.120 --> 3:31:48.760]  into chaos. In an emergency vote, the European Union deploys peacekeepers in
[3:31:48.760 --> 3:31:54.480]  the greater DC area to secure international interest. With separatist
[3:31:54.480 --> 3:32:00.680]  sentiment rising, California's governor declares home rule and secedes from the
[3:32:00.680 --> 3:32:06.080]  Union. Texas follows quickly and declares sovereignty, taking neighboring
[3:32:06.080 --> 3:32:15.320]  states with them and forming the Republic of Texas now. The once United States of
[3:32:15.320 --> 3:32:23.400]  America lie in ruin. A time for words has passed and a second American civil war
[3:32:23.400 --> 3:32:30.320]  now erupts as seven factions wage war across the land. They battle one another
[3:32:30.320 --> 3:32:38.680]  to reclaim a nation, to restore peace, to rebuild this shattered Union.
[3:32:38.680 --> 3:32:45.760]  All right, now notice they gave an Abraham Lincoln quote. Who is Barack
[3:32:45.760 --> 3:32:50.080]  Obama telling us that he's modeled after Abraham Lincoln? Now the British came in
[3:32:50.080 --> 3:32:53.280]  and manipulated both sides, got the South to break off. My family was in the
[3:32:53.280 --> 3:32:56.480]  South, but I'll tell you right now, it was staged. British intelligence openly
[3:32:56.480 --> 3:33:00.200]  manipulated that. The Russian Empire sided with the North, the British
[3:33:00.200 --> 3:33:03.120]  sided with the South giving them weapons. They meant to break up the country.
[3:33:03.120 --> 3:33:07.000]  That's now been declassified. That's in the major British annals to try to break
[3:33:07.000 --> 3:33:11.800]  up the country. The same thing is being set up now. You do not want to riot. You
[3:33:11.800 --> 3:33:14.880]  want to defend your family. You want to take care of your family. You want to
[3:33:14.880 --> 3:33:18.640]  reach out to the military and police to educate them not to come out and
[3:33:18.640 --> 3:33:22.320]  confiscate guns. Now, once they do it, that's another subject, but you don't want
[3:33:22.320 --> 3:33:27.400]  to go out looking for them, trying to engage them. Police and military, if you
[3:33:27.400 --> 3:33:31.000]  don't out and out ignore those orders, you need to just sit on your butts and not
[3:33:31.000 --> 3:33:34.480]  be part of this. They're going to stage riots. They're going to prepare
[3:33:34.480 --> 3:33:37.960]  everybody. This is the game plan. If we get the word out on this, we may back
[3:33:37.960 --> 3:33:41.640]  them off. They may cancel the operation. We haven't had more big terror attack
[3:33:41.640 --> 3:33:45.040]  staged here, though they were planning it because we exposed the false flag
[3:33:45.040 --> 3:33:49.280]  attacks of 9-11. We talk about predictive programming, Elm and Watt.
[3:33:49.280 --> 3:33:54.320]  Hundreds of these video games have similar lines in them and they are
[3:33:54.320 --> 3:33:58.080]  conditioning the public for this. When I would first air this two or three years
[3:33:58.080 --> 3:34:01.400]  ago in other video game clips, people would laugh and say, that'll never come.
[3:34:01.400 --> 3:34:06.120]  We'll never have foreign groups. We'll never have. Now it's on the news that it
[3:34:06.120 --> 3:34:10.040]  is happening and the Marines are in the West Coast just like the states running
[3:34:10.040 --> 3:34:14.480]  checkpoints. The people that made this game were definitely being given
[3:34:14.480 --> 3:34:20.840]  inside information. Ellen Watt. The intelligence communities have basically
[3:34:20.840 --> 3:34:25.520]  been in charge of video games from their inception. That was their whole idea, was
[3:34:25.520 --> 3:34:30.240]  to militarize the public, at least get to the recruits that they'd want who were
[3:34:30.240 --> 3:34:34.520]  conditioned to kill on site when they were told to. They've always been
[3:34:34.520 --> 3:34:40.240]  in charge of video games. Otherwise, we tend to think that industry and
[3:34:40.240 --> 3:34:44.440]  commerce just develops on its own happenstance. That's not true. Those who
[3:34:44.440 --> 3:34:47.960]  are in power never let anything out into the public unless it's a good purpose
[3:34:47.960 --> 3:34:52.760]  to serve those at the top. It comes to toys and things. Believe you me, they
[3:34:52.760 --> 3:34:57.400]  don't militarize the minds of youth unless there's something for that youth
[3:34:57.400 --> 3:35:01.880]  to grow up into doing down the road. They've always been in charge of
[3:35:01.880 --> 3:35:05.360]  video games, but not only that, they've been in charge of the whole culture
[3:35:05.360 --> 3:35:09.880]  industry. Now there are boops coming out with declassified information.
[3:35:09.880 --> 3:35:14.520]  Admitting that, the whole culture for 50 years has been controlled by the CIA, but
[3:35:14.520 --> 3:35:19.320]  the most recent movies coming out of Hollywood, I think nine of them are
[3:35:19.320 --> 3:35:24.680]  disaster-based movies, with this future scenario that's almost here, all on the
[3:35:24.680 --> 3:35:29.240]  same theme. This is mainstream now, indoctrination and predictive
[3:35:29.240 --> 3:35:34.920]  programming of what's to come. It ties in exactly with that strategic studies
[3:35:34.920 --> 3:35:39.680]  report from the military that said it might even break down to civil war
[3:35:39.680 --> 3:35:44.680]  within the United States and even a civil war with nuclear weapons.
[3:35:44.680 --> 3:35:48.960]  And then we have Tommy Franks going on. It turned out he was being paid $500,000 a
[3:35:48.960 --> 3:35:52.360]  year by the Pentagon to go out and give interviews in the press and print and
[3:35:52.360 --> 3:35:56.160]  TV going, I'm real sad, but martial law is the only thing that'll keep you safe
[3:35:56.160 --> 3:36:01.040]  and it is coming. So again, oh, we think there might be riots, boo-hoo. We've got
[3:36:01.040 --> 3:36:04.560]  to go out and attack the American people. And again, now the Arizona police say,
[3:36:04.560 --> 3:36:10.400]  you know, we reported on this yesterday dealing with the fact that the Army War
[3:36:10.400 --> 3:36:12.960]  College says they're preparing to attack the American people. That's gonna be
[3:36:12.960 --> 3:36:16.320]  their main mission. Now domestically, and people denied that the report was real,
[3:36:16.320 --> 3:36:20.520]  here it is in the Arizona Business Journal for everybody in their face. Go
[3:36:20.520 --> 3:36:25.320]  ahead. Yes, so it's in the open now that they're conditioning the general
[3:36:25.320 --> 3:36:29.400]  population to this is inevitable. And they do know that the bulk of the
[3:36:29.400 --> 3:36:33.800]  population will always sit on the back seat and watch what happens. They're
[3:36:33.800 --> 3:36:39.240]  afraid. See, violence itself and law runs on the threat of violence is coercion.
[3:36:39.240 --> 3:36:43.800]  Most people go along with law because they're coerced to do so. And coercion,
[3:36:43.800 --> 3:36:47.520]  if it's not followed or doesn't work, will be backed up with force. Most people
[3:36:47.520 --> 3:36:52.440]  understand that subconsciously and they want to be left alone and they hope that
[3:36:52.440 --> 3:36:56.240]  nothing drastic will happen to them if they sit back and let it happen. They
[3:36:56.240 --> 3:37:00.000]  don't realize that this is a war that's going to continue right down to the
[3:37:00.000 --> 3:37:04.560]  bottom level and no one's going to be unscathed by it. You're not going to get
[3:37:04.560 --> 3:37:08.120]  out of it. So everyone must participate in stopping it from happening in the
[3:37:08.120 --> 3:37:11.840]  first place. That's how you stop these things from happening. Everyone's got to
[3:37:11.840 --> 3:37:17.680]  get involved now and stop being entertained by television and demand
[3:37:17.680 --> 3:37:21.400]  their voice back. We cannot leave this to the experts. The experts work for the
[3:37:21.400 --> 3:37:25.400]  psychopaths. Most of the experts are psychopaths and we've got to nip this in
[3:37:25.400 --> 3:37:29.920]  a bud right now. Now, Alan, we know that they have their own predictive wargaming
[3:37:29.920 --> 3:37:32.920]  with computers and before that with their sociologists, psychologists and others.
[3:37:32.920 --> 3:37:38.080]  You know, they bargain for an Alan Watt and Alex Jones. You know, they bargained
[3:37:38.080 --> 3:37:40.720]  for the people to resist. Though I've seen their white papers, I don't know if
[3:37:40.720 --> 3:37:44.800]  this is disinfo, that the rebellion is much bigger, much more coordinated, much
[3:37:44.800 --> 3:37:48.120]  more widespread. That's why they're saying they want to shut down the free web
[3:37:48.120 --> 3:37:54.720]  and take us to internet too as Google and, of course, Obama are doing. How do
[3:37:54.720 --> 3:37:59.440]  we feed into this, the wildcard? Because it looks like things are not going well
[3:37:59.440 --> 3:38:03.120]  for them and we know they want to act like they're God and omnipresent and
[3:38:03.120 --> 3:38:06.680]  invincible and want to use AI to try to do that, but they really aren't. So, how
[3:38:06.680 --> 3:38:11.760]  do shows like this and your website cut into the matrix, how does all that
[3:38:11.760 --> 3:38:16.720]  feed into this? What are afraid of are people who have the knowledge, the
[3:38:16.720 --> 3:38:20.960]  background, the history and the facts to back up the
[3:38:20.960 --> 3:38:26.200]  exclamations we're giving out right here to public who can then use that and
[3:38:26.200 --> 3:38:29.800]  run with it and teach others. That's what they're afraid of. They don't care about
[3:38:29.800 --> 3:38:32.800]  all the wild and wacky websites out there that mix it all together into
[3:38:32.800 --> 3:38:37.120]  fantasy, but they're after the people who have the knowledge. And Russell
[3:38:37.120 --> 3:38:41.680]  himself said this time would come. He said, if we cannot recruit these
[3:38:41.680 --> 3:38:46.200]  people to leave their own class behind them and join us, we'll have to
[3:38:46.200 --> 3:38:50.200]  eliminate them. And that's coming up, I don't know about you, but I've had over
[3:38:50.200 --> 3:38:55.200]  tours recently from the big world organizations to join them. Very urgent,
[3:38:55.200 --> 3:39:00.960]  very polite invitations to come and speak at their world meetings. And I know
[3:39:00.960 --> 3:39:04.480]  this is the last attempt before they simply eliminate me. I know this is
[3:39:04.480 --> 3:39:10.160]  coming. Well, I mean, I've had major radio networks try to hire me years ago.
[3:39:10.160 --> 3:39:15.960]  I've been approached by some of the biggest Hollywood studios wanting to
[3:39:15.960 --> 3:39:23.640]  put my material out. Kind of golden handcuffs, as they say. I know that I
[3:39:23.640 --> 3:39:26.600]  have been approached, and it's always under confidence, so I can't break
[3:39:26.600 --> 3:39:30.720]  that as a journalist of confidence. But other things happen, like we call up
[3:39:30.720 --> 3:39:34.120]  Rothkopf, former head of the Kissinger Group, who wrote the book Super
[3:39:34.120 --> 3:39:36.480]  Class earlier in the year, admitting that world government's here and they
[3:39:36.480 --> 3:39:39.840]  run everything. And when I got him on the line, my producer had set him up. He
[3:39:39.840 --> 3:39:42.360]  goes, I don't know who you are, Alex Jones. Yeah, we watch your work. You
[3:39:42.360 --> 3:39:46.440]  know, you really ought to. And John Harmon, you know, was the only witness to
[3:39:46.440 --> 3:39:48.840]  this because he was up in Minnesota and I was on the line with him. They'd
[3:39:48.840 --> 3:39:51.640]  called him saying, you know, you really ought to join us. You know, there's
[3:39:51.640 --> 3:39:57.720]  nothing you can really do. And I've had other people contact me and say,
[3:39:57.720 --> 3:40:00.680]  listen, the public scum, you know, they're a bunch of trash, a bunch of
[3:40:00.680 --> 3:40:04.760]  backstabbing garbage that they will destroy you. You need to join us. You're
[3:40:04.760 --> 3:40:11.360]  one of us. So yes, I have had those overtures and I know that that's how
[3:40:11.360 --> 3:40:14.520]  the threat works. It's like, look, we're giving you a chance. We're not like
[3:40:14.520 --> 3:40:17.720]  Pol Pot who just killed anybody who could read your warglasses, you know, who
[3:40:17.720 --> 3:40:24.120]  could see through his garbage. They try to co-opt and you think that rebuffing,
[3:40:24.120 --> 3:40:31.160]  repeated co-ops is a sign that they're going to another level? Absolutely.
[3:40:31.160 --> 3:40:35.960]  When you get some coming one after another for world meetings, you know,
[3:40:35.960 --> 3:40:40.200]  this is the last overture and they've pretty well hinted at much of
[3:40:40.200 --> 3:40:44.680]  and much of their writings from these institutes at the war colleges, etc.
[3:40:44.680 --> 3:40:48.440]  that they'll have to stop all agitators as they call it.
[3:40:48.440 --> 3:40:51.720]  Well, we must be getting through to them because we can be confronting marines
[3:40:51.720 --> 3:40:56.920]  on the streets of Austin doing psyops or marine spokesmen in California.
[3:40:56.920 --> 3:41:00.120]  I mean, we call them up and we're like, oh, we know who you are, Alex Jones. Yeah,
[3:41:00.120 --> 3:41:03.080]  we're fully aware of your operations and then they tell us all about our website
[3:41:03.080 --> 3:41:07.160]  and stories we wrote. I mean, so that tells me we're really having an effect
[3:41:07.160 --> 3:41:11.160]  when their own establishment is aware of what we're doing. I mean, it shows that
[3:41:11.160 --> 3:41:15.560]  that job that we're having an effect. Now, there's no doubt on that.
[3:41:15.560 --> 3:41:18.840]  I had some bureaucrats who went to Washington, D.C. and then in the
[3:41:18.840 --> 3:41:23.480]  cocktail parties, people were mentioning the names that are
[3:41:23.480 --> 3:41:28.440]  making a difference and it's common talk amongst those particular
[3:41:28.440 --> 3:41:32.120]  classes. So we are making some difference. Absolutely. We're
[3:41:32.120 --> 3:41:36.120]  being noticed and not just noticed, but timely monitored and watched.
[3:41:36.120 --> 3:41:41.960]  So, you know, Bill Clinton was in town last year and my mother's,
[3:41:41.960 --> 3:41:46.120]  my wife's mother has been active of the Democratic Party. So it was a
[3:41:46.120 --> 3:41:49.240]  Democratic Party dinner. There was about a hundred people there and they're all
[3:41:49.240 --> 3:41:54.680]  around Bill Clinton talking and somebody said, what do you think?
[3:41:54.680 --> 3:41:58.280]  Not my not my wife's mother, but one of her friends said, what do you think about
[3:41:58.280 --> 3:42:01.720]  Alex Jones, you know, the radio and TV guy who's talking about the New World
[3:42:01.720 --> 3:42:07.880]  Order? And Bill Clinton said, let me think of the exact quote,
[3:42:07.880 --> 3:42:15.640]  Alex Jones is one of the most important commentators
[3:42:15.640 --> 3:42:18.680]  and what he's saying is some of the most important things being said in the
[3:42:18.680 --> 3:42:22.200]  world. And they said, you mean Alex Jones, the, you know, the young anti-New
[3:42:22.200 --> 3:42:25.080]  World Order guy? He said, yeah, Alex Jones and mentioned some things.
[3:42:25.080 --> 3:42:28.520]  I mean, that is just absolutely incredible
[3:42:28.520 --> 3:42:33.800]  and it's kind of bone showing, Alan. Yeah, well, they are monitoring, as I say,
[3:42:33.800 --> 3:42:38.200]  anyone who declaim is an agitator or someone that can
[3:42:38.200 --> 3:42:41.640]  break through the matrix. But why would he say something nice about me?
[3:42:41.640 --> 3:42:46.040]  It doesn't necessarily be nice. See, what you're saying is what we are saying
[3:42:46.040 --> 3:42:51.320]  is important. In other words, it's true. And of course, it means that
[3:42:51.320 --> 3:42:56.520]  this, because it's so true, they cannot ignore it, but they also hope the public
[3:42:56.520 --> 3:42:59.960]  or the general public will be overwhelmed. But they're regular media,
[3:42:59.960 --> 3:43:03.960]  which keeps them in limbo. Well, Alan, isn't there something even more?
[3:43:03.960 --> 3:43:07.080]  Within the pyramidal structure, according to Rothkopf and others, and I agree,
[3:43:07.080 --> 3:43:10.680]  there's only about 3,000 to 6,000 people that even have
[3:43:10.680 --> 3:43:14.920]  95% of the big picture and that we've reverse engineered from their
[3:43:14.920 --> 3:43:18.440]  documents and reading different compartments of their operation
[3:43:18.440 --> 3:43:22.200]  really accurately what they're doing. And so the few
[3:43:22.200 --> 3:43:25.560]  commentators or reporters out there that actually know what they're doing and
[3:43:25.560 --> 3:43:29.960]  accurately are reporting it, they are recognizing that because even within
[3:43:29.960 --> 3:43:33.400]  their own elite, most of their people don't realize the big picture.
[3:43:33.400 --> 3:43:36.600]  And I think that's another danger is members of the elite, members of the
[3:43:36.600 --> 3:43:40.680]  establishment who didn't have the full picture are hearing and seeing what we
[3:43:40.680 --> 3:43:43.640]  have to say. And I think that's causing them some problems.
[3:43:43.640 --> 3:43:47.560]  Another example is General Stubblebind's wife, Dr. Labo,
[3:43:47.560 --> 3:43:51.880]  treats a head of state. And they've given me evidence of this. They
[3:43:51.880 --> 3:43:54.840]  can't say the name on air. And the head of state's like, I know I'm
[3:43:54.840 --> 3:43:57.480]  sad that we have to kill everybody and I kind of don't like it.
[3:43:57.480 --> 3:44:01.800]  But this is how it was brought up. So I think the establishment, a lot of them,
[3:44:01.800 --> 3:44:05.080]  except for that inner core, are having second thoughts about this.
[3:44:05.080 --> 3:44:09.800]  What I found, and this is the factual as well,
[3:44:09.800 --> 3:44:13.480]  when the government, the US government and the Canadian government, and I think
[3:44:13.480 --> 3:44:17.880]  the British one too, stopped their employees from going to my
[3:44:17.880 --> 3:44:21.640]  website at their work as banned that they can't get in.
[3:44:21.640 --> 3:44:25.240]  Lots of them have told me that. When that's happened, you see,
[3:44:25.240 --> 3:44:27.960]  it's more important to them that their bureaucrats
[3:44:27.960 --> 3:44:31.880]  live under their own little illusions. They cannot afford to have their
[3:44:31.880 --> 3:44:35.720]  bureaucracies waking up, because that really is
[3:44:35.720 --> 3:44:40.280]  important to them. They are generally kept in a state of
[3:44:40.280 --> 3:44:43.080]  double think, double speak. They're never really.
[3:44:43.080 --> 3:44:46.040]  But when you come out, when they hear people talking the truth,
[3:44:46.040 --> 3:44:49.640]  the work they're involved in suddenly becomes more clear to them. They realize
[3:44:49.640 --> 3:44:53.160]  the whys and the wear force for the first time, because they themselves
[3:44:53.160 --> 3:44:57.480]  have been heavily programmed. And that's what the leader are afraid of.
[3:44:57.480 --> 3:45:01.240]  The elites need the massive bureaucratic class
[3:45:01.240 --> 3:45:04.520]  to guide all of this into place and to get to work.
[3:45:04.520 --> 3:45:09.080]  Historically, it's the minion servant class to the elite that is one of the
[3:45:09.080 --> 3:45:12.680]  most surveilled, oppressed, controlled, and murdered
[3:45:12.680 --> 3:45:15.400]  and abused groups. So they need to come out and join
[3:45:15.400 --> 3:45:20.520]  free humanity. And yes, infowars.com, prisonplanet.com, a band in Europe at the
[3:45:20.520 --> 3:45:22.600]  major train stations and quote free government
[3:45:22.600 --> 3:45:26.520]  Wi-Fi's, band and government institutions, band at Dell, cut into the
[3:45:26.520 --> 3:45:29.480]  matrix.com. I've seen the screenshots online that
[3:45:29.480 --> 3:45:33.240]  where it says band, this is extreme. But all you're doing is posting and
[3:45:33.240 --> 3:45:37.480]  reporting on their own documents, Alan. I want to come back and take a few
[3:45:37.480 --> 3:45:40.280]  final calls. We've got to have you back again soon from Tim, Sherry, Tom, and
[3:45:40.280 --> 3:45:43.720]  Elliot. I don't know how many we can get to, but we're going to try. But before we
[3:45:43.720 --> 3:45:47.560]  end this segment, what are some of the things that are most
[3:45:47.560 --> 3:45:50.280]  important to you right now that we haven't covered, Alan?
[3:45:50.280 --> 3:45:55.480]  The important things really are, see what the leader says, it follows
[3:45:55.480 --> 3:45:58.760]  or what you've been talking about. So they're watching us as well.
[3:45:58.760 --> 3:46:01.880]  What they're looking for, not so much for people who simply put the
[3:46:01.880 --> 3:46:05.640]  information out, but can those people be potential
[3:46:05.640 --> 3:46:10.840]  leaders? If you have that ability to bring people together,
[3:46:10.840 --> 3:46:14.360]  to it with a common stance on something, then you're very, very, very
[3:46:14.360 --> 3:46:19.000]  dangerous. And they're waiting to see how we react,
[3:46:19.000 --> 3:46:22.600]  we on the radio react when we influence so many people
[3:46:22.600 --> 3:46:29.240]  when basically the shit hits a fan. So we're being used as a gauge. We're
[3:46:29.240 --> 3:46:34.920]  being used as an overall war game to see how the
[3:46:34.920 --> 3:46:38.040]  public's responding. To see how they're responding and to
[3:46:38.040 --> 3:46:41.880]  see if we yourselves will come out with ways and
[3:46:41.880 --> 3:46:45.800]  innovative ways they haven't perceived to start to get
[3:46:45.800 --> 3:46:49.560]  people bonding together in a common stance against this tyranny.
[3:46:49.560 --> 3:46:53.400]  If we have that ability, we are very, very dangerous.
[3:46:53.400 --> 3:46:56.600]  Well, it's a little too late. I mean, this canary sung. I mean, we put our
[3:46:56.600 --> 3:47:00.280]  information out and I think that's the only reason we're still walking around,
[3:47:00.280 --> 3:47:03.880]  Alan, what? It probably is. If we go to the next level
[3:47:03.880 --> 3:47:08.440]  of advising what to do with that, we're really, we'll be very, very well
[3:47:08.440 --> 3:47:11.400]  noticed then. All right, I want to skip this break for
[3:47:11.400 --> 3:47:16.680]  JustPrisonPlanet.tv viewers and for folks listening to the
[3:47:16.680 --> 3:47:19.320]  infowars.com audio streams for everybody else in the AM and FM
[3:47:19.320 --> 3:47:21.800]  Shorway satellite. We'll be right back in three minutes to
[3:47:21.800 --> 3:47:26.280]  jam in some final calls. Stay with us.
[3:47:26.280 --> 3:47:30.040]  Alan, I think they're going to have trouble killing us. Instead, what I see
[3:47:30.040 --> 3:47:33.320]  happening is this flotella of mainstream TV shows demonizing
[3:47:33.320 --> 3:47:37.320]  myself and others, attacking 9-11 Truth, attacking
[3:47:37.320 --> 3:47:40.120]  the alternative media and then trying to shut down the web.
[3:47:40.120 --> 3:47:43.640]  Now then down the road, they may try to set us up with some type of crime or
[3:47:43.640 --> 3:47:47.880]  burn us out as they try to physically do with you. Do you concur with that?
[3:47:47.880 --> 3:47:51.400]  That's very, very possible. As I say, if they can't win you over, they have to
[3:47:51.400 --> 3:47:55.560]  eliminate you and if you do have the ability to guide lots of people
[3:47:55.560 --> 3:48:00.520]  in a common purpose or a cause, then they'll definitely have to do
[3:48:00.520 --> 3:48:03.880]  something about it. Well, I want to state on record that the elite is not invincible
[3:48:03.880 --> 3:48:06.840]  and we've had many victories against them. The only way to stop them though is to
[3:48:06.840 --> 3:48:10.440]  get the mass, you know, large portions of it, like Winston finally figures out that
[3:48:10.440 --> 3:48:13.800]  the secret is the proles, not what he always been told about it being the
[3:48:13.800 --> 3:48:18.200]  party and the inner party. We have to find people out there in the
[3:48:18.200 --> 3:48:22.280]  general public that will resist and will speak out and I see that
[3:48:22.280 --> 3:48:25.080]  happening. Let's go ahead and go to some calls. Tim in Ohio, you're on the
[3:48:25.080 --> 3:48:31.880]  air with Alan Watt. Thanks for holding. Go ahead, Tim.
[3:48:31.880 --> 3:48:36.280]  Hi, Alex. Yes, sir. Go ahead. I haven't talked in a while and a couple things.
[3:48:36.280 --> 3:48:39.720]  A comment and a question. I hadn't talked to you since the convention and I had
[3:48:39.720 --> 3:48:45.000]  never, ever seen evil personified in a woman's face like that Michelle
[3:48:45.000 --> 3:48:48.280]  Malcolm. Oh my god. She should change her name to
[3:48:48.280 --> 3:48:51.080]  Medusa. Well, look, I mean, look how they sent people in that were with her and
[3:48:51.080 --> 3:48:53.800]  left with her to scream, kill Michelle Malcolm so
[3:48:53.800 --> 3:48:57.000]  could then be put all over radio and TV and try to get me blackballed and it
[3:48:57.000 --> 3:49:00.200]  almost happened until it backfired because other videos
[3:49:00.200 --> 3:49:03.400]  got up on YouTube showing that they were with her, that the whole deal was
[3:49:03.400 --> 3:49:06.680]  staged, and then she had to back off and admit I didn't say that.
[3:49:06.680 --> 3:49:11.080]  But that was very close. Yeah, very bad. Alan, are you there?
[3:49:11.080 --> 3:49:14.600]  Yes. I want a question for both of you.
[3:49:14.600 --> 3:49:18.040]  Knowing that the stain that the elite have
[3:49:18.040 --> 3:49:22.120]  for the black race, you know, why would they pick Obama for president
[3:49:22.120 --> 3:49:26.120]  and will it play out that Obama is going to be exposed and Biden
[3:49:26.120 --> 3:49:28.760]  being inaugurated? Well, what's going to happen is they're going to use him as a
[3:49:28.760 --> 3:49:31.480]  puppet for a while, then they're going to destroy his name forever.
[3:49:31.480 --> 3:49:35.000]  And yes, it will be used away to demonize black people.
[3:49:35.000 --> 3:49:39.480]  Comment, Alan, what? Black people and then Hillary, I think if he steps down,
[3:49:39.480 --> 3:49:42.680]  will take over as president and then she'll be even worse.
[3:49:42.680 --> 3:49:47.160]  They always put enough female in history in the bloodiest periods.
[3:49:47.160 --> 3:49:51.320]  You'll find that's the way of doing it. They love symbolism and they love the
[3:49:51.320 --> 3:49:53.960]  routine. Yeah, the goddess will extract the blood.
[3:49:53.960 --> 3:49:57.640]  Yes. And so that's how they would set up. So demonize one.
[3:49:57.640 --> 3:50:01.320]  And probably it will cause some kind of civil war within the U.S.
[3:50:01.320 --> 3:50:05.080]  as this sparks off. Obama will use all the forces that have been put on the books
[3:50:05.080 --> 3:50:09.800]  by the Bush regime. He set up the machinery for it. Obama will use it.
[3:50:09.800 --> 3:50:13.080]  He'll be hated. He'll probably eventually step down or go off sick.
[3:50:13.080 --> 3:50:17.160]  He'll just leave us sick. And Hillary will probably take over and
[3:50:17.160 --> 3:50:20.360]  and then of course she'll be the real fix and they'll use ultimate force.
[3:50:20.360 --> 3:50:23.400]  Tim, hold on. We're coming back to the full audience. I'll let you have one more comment.
[3:50:23.400 --> 3:50:24.600]  Appreciate your calling. Here we go.
[3:50:27.480 --> 3:50:29.880]  Okay, let's hurry. Let's hurry here and
[3:50:31.560 --> 3:50:36.280]  Tim, finish up the comments from Ohio, then Sherry and others. I want to jam in a few more here.
[3:50:37.160 --> 3:50:43.400]  Just to follow to my question was if they do not have Obama or Biden in,
[3:50:43.400 --> 3:50:50.040]  what are the chances of Cheney and little old temporary Bush remaining in power
[3:50:50.040 --> 3:50:52.760]  after inauguration day due to some type of fault?
[3:50:52.760 --> 3:50:57.160]  Look, they want a new puppet to get. They've invested too much in Obama.
[3:50:57.160 --> 3:51:01.160]  I believe he's going to go into office and then it's going to be really serious.
[3:51:01.160 --> 3:51:02.120]  Alan, what?
[3:51:02.120 --> 3:51:03.560]  No, I concur with that, Tim.
[3:51:03.560 --> 3:51:07.240]  All right. Got to jump, Tim. Appreciate the call. Let's talk to Sherry in Texas.
[3:51:07.240 --> 3:51:09.000]  Sherry, you're on the air. Welcome.
[3:51:09.960 --> 3:51:15.240]  Hey, Alan. I just wanted to say that you're my sociological guru. I think you're right on the
[3:51:15.240 --> 3:51:19.960]  list. I know you've been studying these systems for a long time and I really think you know what
[3:51:19.960 --> 3:51:26.360]  you're talking about. My question for you is how are the elite able to get such strong people,
[3:51:26.360 --> 3:51:32.760]  you know, like in the upper middle class in America to accept the dehumanization and also
[3:51:32.760 --> 3:51:37.240]  the Yashor genocide? Basically, the doctors are killing people here.
[3:51:38.200 --> 3:51:44.200]  It's ambient. It's incremental. They slowly upgraded it until we're at a fever pitch.
[3:51:44.200 --> 3:51:45.400]  Let's get Alan's take on that.
[3:51:46.040 --> 3:51:50.760]  Yes. It's incremental. It's intergenerational dehumanization. You have three generations
[3:51:50.760 --> 3:51:56.680]  sitting watching television together and the oldest is embarrassed at regular fear for
[3:51:56.680 --> 3:52:01.400]  reviewers and entertainment. The young ones don't mind. The one in the middle is already
[3:52:01.400 --> 3:52:06.920]  accepting it. So it's intergenerational indoctrination and propaganda and dehumanization.
[3:52:06.920 --> 3:52:10.520]  That's right. They train people to love tyranny, love evil, to feel like they're part of the
[3:52:10.520 --> 3:52:16.360]  winning team, to associate themselves with the system. Again, they act like sex and violence
[3:52:16.360 --> 3:52:21.960]  and destruction is cool and the nerds just don't understand. Really, they're shearing the conscience
[3:52:21.960 --> 3:52:25.720]  so you'll accept your neighbors being drug off or yourself being drug off and so when you're
[3:52:25.720 --> 3:52:31.720]  being drug off, your neighbors will accept it. Sherry? That's exactly right. Also, as far as
[3:52:31.720 --> 3:52:37.400]  the cancer rate here, it's just skyrocketing. They actually have a big room with all these
[3:52:37.400 --> 3:52:41.560]  comfy chairs where all the ladies who have cancer, they sit and they get to socialize
[3:52:41.560 --> 3:52:46.120]  while they get their chemo. And they make it a social fun thing. I appreciate your call. We're
[3:52:46.120 --> 3:52:51.400]  out of time, Sherry. And I apologize to Tom, Elliot, Grace and others. Next time Alan's on,
[3:52:51.400 --> 3:52:55.880]  you can call in. You'll go to the head of the line. Alan Watt, I really want to appreciate
[3:52:55.880 --> 3:53:00.200]  you coming on the show, coming to TheMatrix.com. Give folks your European mirror site.
[3:53:00.920 --> 3:53:06.120]  Yes. Alan Watt sent in sentinel.eu and he transcripts in download and print up and
[3:53:06.120 --> 3:53:10.440]  the different languages. All right. We appreciate all your time and we appreciate your time.
[3:53:10.440 --> 3:53:14.360]  Let's work for humanity. I want to talk to you again coming up early in the new year as things
[3:53:15.000 --> 3:53:19.240]  develop and things unfold. Thank you, Alan Watt. It's been a pleasure, Alex. Always a pleasure
[3:53:19.240 --> 3:53:23.080]  having you on it, true gentleman. We got a lot of information out in that show today. We've been
[3:53:23.080 --> 3:53:27.480]  live for almost two hours at prisonplanet.tv. If you're watching the live streams, we're also
[3:53:27.480 --> 3:53:32.920]  going to be posting this for prisonplanet.tv members in the highest quality that we have up on
[3:53:32.920 --> 3:53:37.960]  prisonplanet.tv and we're about to upgrade. The films I post are in super high, almost high
[3:53:37.960 --> 3:53:42.680]  def. These, so they can be streamed out, are in lower quality, but we're about to start encoding
[3:53:42.680 --> 3:53:48.600]  and recording another copy that's an even higher quality to post for prisonplanet.tv members in
[3:53:48.600 --> 3:53:53.400]  the next few weeks. We are working to make it all as good as we can for you. Before I end this
[3:53:53.400 --> 3:53:57.640]  broadcast, I do want to tell you that the rebroadcast is coming up with Congressman Ron Paul at the
[3:53:57.640 --> 3:54:02.680]  very start. It'll be rearing on AM and FM stations across the country whenever they rebroadcast us
[3:54:02.680 --> 3:54:09.400]  and on WWCR from 9 to 1 AM this evening. But right now on the streams, he was on at the
[3:54:09.400 --> 3:54:15.640]  five after at infowars.com on the re-streams and you can download, of course, the free podcast
[3:54:15.640 --> 3:54:22.040]  there as well. Get prepared, get self-sufficient. And one big way to do that is eFoodsDirect.com,
[3:54:22.040 --> 3:54:27.640]  the letter E, foodsdirect.com, big banners up on infowars.com and prisonplanet.com. This is the
[3:54:27.640 --> 3:54:33.080]  highest quality storeable foods company for the best price I've found, non-GMO, healthy, grown

[3:54:49.880 --> 3:54:54.760]  Ron Paul right now when we come back on the internet streams at infowars.com. But be sure
[3:54:54.760 --> 3:55:01.160]  and check out eFoodsDirect.com or 800-409-5633. Great job to the crew, the affiliates, the sponsors,
[3:55:01.160 --> 3:55:04.360]  John Harmon, everybody. God bless you all. Prisonplanet.tv.

[3:55:15.800 --> 3:55:21.560]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against
[3:55:21.560 --> 3:55:27.960]  this country. The enemy struck America on September 11th. But who is the enemy? Ben Lawton. This is
[3:55:27.960 --> 3:55:32.680]  his M.O. We have to look to the Middle East. We have to look to Osama Ben Lawton. Fabled Enemies
[3:55:32.680 --> 3:55:37.320]  is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks
[3:55:37.320 --> 3:55:42.600]  inside the United States. Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much
[3:55:42.600 --> 3:55:52.760]  engaged in spying in and on the U.S. I'm aware that.
