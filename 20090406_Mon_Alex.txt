[00:00:04.966 --> 00:00:09.810]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:11.391]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.391 --> 00:00:12.953]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.953 --> 00:00:17.136]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.136 --> 00:00:21.200]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:40.935 --> 00:00:42.257]  Hello ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:42.257 --> 00:00:43.859]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:00:43.859 --> 00:00:45.321]  It is the sixth day of April 2009.
[00:00:45.321 --> 00:00:49.427]  We're going to be live here for the next four hours.
[00:00:49.427 --> 00:00:52.411]  We have Max Keiser, BBC host.
[00:00:55.543 --> 00:01:01.528]  Top Stop Broker Economist joining us coming up in the final hour today.
[00:01:01.528 --> 00:01:05.512]  I had Michael Bagnerik set up for the show.
[00:01:05.512 --> 00:01:15.400]  I was going to do my big FEMA Camp expose last Friday, but I had some issues come up where I had to take off, so Burma sat in, so I wasn't here.
[00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:18.243]  And so I have to do the FEMA Camp analysis today.
[00:01:19.622 --> 00:01:22.625]  Just hours ahead of Glenn Beck's scheduled debunking.
[00:01:22.625 --> 00:01:24.747]  And so we're going to move Bagnerik to later in the week.
[00:01:24.747 --> 00:01:30.452]  I apologize to Michael Bagnerik, constitutional scholar, good friend of mine, great political mind.
[00:01:30.452 --> 00:01:33.515]  He will be joining us coming up later in the week, if he can move.
[00:01:33.515 --> 00:01:35.557]  If he can do it, I'm sure he probably can.
[00:01:35.557 --> 00:01:38.400]  So that is coming up today.
[00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.963]  Max Keiser will be in the final hour, always.
[00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:54.315]  Informative, goes on international television and says the economy was destroyed in a controlled demolition just like the World Trade Center towers.
[00:01:54.315 --> 00:02:01.959]  Has a lot of courage and has a once a week show called The Oracle on the BBC.
[00:02:01.959 --> 00:02:06.041]  So that is coming up later in this transmission.
[00:02:07.193 --> 00:02:08.835]  Okay, this is what's gonna happen.
[00:02:08.835 --> 00:02:16.681]  I'm gonna cover a host of important news for the next hour and eight minutes.
[00:02:16.681 --> 00:02:26.390]  And then, I'm gonna do about an hour and 52 minutes on the reality of the FEMA camps.
[00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:31.174]  Now, here's the problem.
[00:02:31.174 --> 00:02:33.556]  I went back through my research this weekend.
[00:02:35.544 --> 00:02:46.848]  And literally printed 200 plus mainstream news articles, bills, legislation, Pentagon statements.
[00:02:46.848 --> 00:02:55.170]  And got in this morning a few hours early, but my board ops come in right at about 11, because they also come back at night and run Burma's show.
[00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:57.091]  They're really not just board ops, they direct the TV show.
[00:02:58.786 --> 00:03:04.649]  TV producers slash directors, I guess you'd call them, Paul Hartman and Jaron Neihard.
[00:03:04.649 --> 00:03:13.573]  So they're in there right now trying to pull up 200 plus news articles, video clips, in the folders in the order I just gave them to.
[00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:33.617]  So they're in a race to get all this loaded on the computer, the articles, the documents, the Miami Herald from the eighties, the list goes on and on, video clips of FEMA camps, troops training to confiscate your guns, and so we're racing to get all of this loaded in.
[00:03:33.617 --> 00:03:39.322]  Now, the guys, Jaron and Paul,
[00:03:40.279 --> 00:03:45.821]  Work on the Sunday Show too, so they really only get one day off with their families.
[00:03:45.821 --> 00:03:50.303]  I guess I could have drug them in here last night to probably load all this in.
[00:03:50.303 --> 00:03:58.426]  But the issue is there's just so much evidence, so many documents, so many things to cover, so many pieces of evidence to go over.
[00:04:00.831 --> 00:04:07.815]  That it takes three or four of us days and days and days just to prepare to try to put all this evidence on.
[00:04:07.815 --> 00:04:17.640]  Every piece of it is open and shut, absolute admissions, proof of giant FEMA camps everywhere.
[00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:22.843]  And all of the news that ties into that.
[00:04:22.843 --> 00:04:26.224]  The fact that this country is under martial law.
[00:04:26.224 --> 00:04:27.225]  The fact that this nation
[00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:33.051]  Has been taken over by the military industrial complex.
[00:04:33.051 --> 00:04:34.212]  That's all there.
[00:04:34.212 --> 00:04:39.374]  So that's coming up in about an hour from now.
[00:04:39.374 --> 00:04:45.917]  In the meantime, Italian earthquake, 92 dead, 50,000 homeless.
[00:04:45.917 --> 00:04:53.540]  And the scientist that warned that it was coming with his data was muzzled by the government.
[00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:57.422]  We'll also get into these mass shootings happening all over the place.
[00:04:57.422 --> 00:04:57.882]  Stay with us.
[00:05:01.075 --> 00:05:04.596]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[00:05:04.596 --> 00:05:09.998]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[00:05:09.998 --> 00:05:15.140]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into the skin.
[00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:26.264]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and it's designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae and fungus.
[00:05:26.664 --> 00:05:32.450]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons or 1 year whichever comes first.
[00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:38.716]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals and bacteria.
[00:05:38.716 --> 00:05:39.757]  What about you?
[00:05:39.757 --> 00:05:41.679]  Order your KDF Shower Filter normally.
[00:05:41.679 --> 00:05:46.203]  $49 for a special price of only $39.99 with free shipping.

[00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:55.471]  That's 1-877-886-3653.

[00:06:01.253 --> 00:06:07.294]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:06:07.294 --> 00:06:12.556]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[00:06:13.166 --> 00:06:19.668]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:06:19.668 --> 00:06:21.629]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:06:21.629 --> 00:06:24.110]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:34.994]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[00:06:37.282 --> 00:06:38.942]  It's not about left or right.
[00:06:38.942 --> 00:06:40.803]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:06:40.803 --> 00:06:47.724]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[00:06:55.986 --> 00:06:57.547]  The Obama Deception.
[00:06:57.547 --> 00:06:58.747]  The people strike back.
[00:07:00.549 --> 00:07:01.910]  Hello, this is Steve Shank.
[00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:04.312]  Alex has told you you have to get a supply of food.
[00:07:04.312 --> 00:07:08.475]  But Alex and I have decided that there are some of you that we really don't want to have food.
[00:07:08.475 --> 00:07:10.517]  If you're a politician who voted for the bailout,
[00:07:14.517 --> 00:07:14.937]  We're good to go!
[00:07:45.247 --> 00:07:45.647]  Big Brother!
[00:08:06.557 --> 00:08:08.339]  Mainstream media.
[00:08:08.339 --> 00:08:10.101]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:10.101 --> 00:08:11.682]  You want answers?
[00:08:11.682 --> 00:08:13.224]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:13.224 --> 00:08:17.428]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:17.428 --> 00:08:21.473]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:47.946]  At least 92 people are dead and 50,000 homeless in an earthquake which has flattened parts of central Italy.
[00:08:47.946 --> 00:08:57.795]  Reuters is reporting that the geologist in Italy who warned the government that the quake was coming and even picked the date was muzzled by the government and told to shut up.
[00:09:00.154 --> 00:09:04.695]  So a real tragedy there, but that's what happens living on this planet.
[00:09:04.695 --> 00:09:08.437]  Analysts say North Korean rocket not a total failure.
[00:09:08.437 --> 00:09:19.720]  North Korea's rocket may have fallen into the sea but military experts cautioned Monday against calling it a complete failure, noting that it traveled twice as far as any missile the country has launched so far.
[00:09:21.104 --> 00:09:22.025]  Well, that's not true.
[00:09:22.025 --> 00:09:31.230]  They fired one that hit Alaska, what, seven years ago, according to the Anchorage newspapers and others, but that was kept quiet because they didn't want to hype that up.
[00:09:31.230 --> 00:09:36.913]  Although the distance was still far from reaching U.S.
[00:09:36.913 --> 00:09:43.596]  territory, it rattled the globe with the U.S.
[00:09:43.596 --> 00:09:48.899]  and what happened here with this article is, I was wondering why I was reading this in the AP
[00:09:51.220 --> 00:09:58.364]  This article got cut off here, so I keep trying to read it and it's cut off because it put a little pop-up window there up over the story.
[00:09:58.364 --> 00:10:00.565]  I was looking at it going, what is that?
[00:10:00.565 --> 00:10:02.186]  Now I understand.
[00:10:02.186 --> 00:10:15.274]  The launch, which demonstrated progress, is a particularly worrying development for a beleaguered country that says it has nuclear weapons and once threatened to turn Seoul into a sea of fire.
[00:10:16.479 --> 00:10:21.941]  Well, it's a pathetic country run by a psychopathic dictator.
[00:10:21.941 --> 00:10:24.362]  What do you expect from him?
[00:10:24.362 --> 00:10:25.542]  I mean, this is what they do.
[00:10:25.542 --> 00:10:32.624]  This is what the state turns into when the government claims that the state is God and the state owns everyone.
[00:10:32.624 --> 00:10:40.067]  And this is the path that the United States and the rest of the world are marching on inside the new world order system.
[00:10:43.837 --> 00:10:45.878]  This is what Barack Obama is setting up.
[00:10:45.878 --> 00:10:56.125]  This is what the control freaks that run the globalist system are doing.
[00:10:56.125 --> 00:10:59.187]  So we'll be getting more into that report today as well.
[00:10:59.187 --> 00:11:04.410]  A lot of economic news is coming in and it's not pretty.
[00:11:04.410 --> 00:11:07.873]  We know the federal government cooks the unemployment numbers.
[00:11:09.178 --> 00:11:19.424]  They've been claiming that unemployment was at 8 or 9 percent the last year, but they don't count you as unemployed if you've gone off the unemployment rolls.
[00:11:19.424 --> 00:11:33.213]  So that number is a fairy tale, but even their fairy tale numbers are now saying that it's gone above 15 percent, which is just a massive, massive unemployment.
[00:11:42.116 --> 00:11:44.538]  Meanwhile, what is Ben Bernanke saying?
[00:11:44.538 --> 00:11:51.523]  Well, they want to continue to drive down confidence and freak everybody out so they can bankrupt the economy and consolidate it during the fire sale.
[00:11:51.523 --> 00:11:53.925]  This is from Bloomberg Financial.
[00:11:53.925 --> 00:12:01.952]  Bernanke says green shoots may signal fall-spring amid job losses.
[00:12:03.203 --> 00:12:08.985]  And so he's saying, hey, there's a few good economic numbers coming in, but don't look at those.
[00:12:08.985 --> 00:12:10.185]  Look at the job losses.
[00:12:10.185 --> 00:12:17.347]  This is a false spring, and we may have another hard freeze that kills the economy again.
[00:12:17.347 --> 00:12:23.608]  It will be months before it's clear whether what Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke calls the U.S.
[00:12:23.608 --> 00:12:29.810]  economy's green shoots represents the early onset of recovery or a false spring.
[00:12:30.950 --> 00:12:35.604]  And it goes on to report that April 3rd report that the economy shed an additional 663,000 jobs.
[00:12:40.390 --> 00:12:44.353]  Then it will be followed by months more of bad news headlines, economists say.
[00:12:44.353 --> 00:12:55.060]  The recession now, in its 17th month, has already cost 5.1 million Americans their jobs, the worst drop in post-war era.
[00:12:55.060 --> 00:13:04.806]  Unemployment may hit 9.4% this year, according to the mainstream estimate in Bloomberg News Survey, and may top out above 10% in 2010.
[00:13:08.032 --> 00:13:08.512]  Oh really?
[00:13:08.512 --> 00:13:13.113]  I saw the headline yesterday and it's really above fifteen percent.
[00:13:13.113 --> 00:13:29.657]  The risk is that jobs pitchers turns even more bleak than the forecast on the drumbeat of bad news still to come, causes consumers whose spending has firmed up in recent months to hunker down again.
[00:13:29.657 --> 00:13:33.378]  If something happens to spook consumers and they crawl back into their tortoise shells,
[00:13:34.608 --> 00:13:45.375]  That would be terrible news, said Alan Blender, former Fed Vice Chairman and now an economist, professor for Princeton University.
[00:13:45.375 --> 00:13:47.816]  So there's that financial news.
[00:13:47.816 --> 00:13:54.940]  Americans feel 15.6% unemployment as underemployment surges.
[00:13:54.940 --> 00:13:59.803]  And that's the Bloomberg headline I was talking about, saying 15 plus percent.
[00:13:59.803 --> 00:14:00.284]  Joseph
[00:14:01.198 --> 00:14:12.102]  Ramelow gave up searching for a job in January to return to school two months after he was laid off as a San Francisco electrician clerk.
[00:14:12.102 --> 00:14:20.945]  Antonio Poe is struggling to get by by doing part-time landscaping in Greensboro, North Carolina after losing his job as an electrician.
[00:14:22.062 --> 00:14:34.248]  While such workers are feeling real pain from the recession that began in December of 07, they're not represented in the 8.5% unemployment rate that Labor Department reported last week.
[00:14:34.248 --> 00:14:44.012]  They are part of a broader group that includes those who want a job but have stopped looking for work and those who want full-time positions but have to settle for part-time employment.
[00:14:46.545 --> 00:15:01.762]  A measure of underemployment that counts those people has almost doubled over the past two years to 15.6%, providing a more complete gauge of the labor market deterioration.
[00:15:01.762 --> 00:15:03.784]  And you add the 8.5% to that, and you're talking...
[00:15:06.787 --> 00:15:07.827]  That's an actual quote.
[00:15:07.827 --> 00:15:10.468]  What a socialist, globalist minion brought up by the big central banks.
[00:15:10.468 --> 00:15:10.988]  What a demonic twerp.
[00:15:36.280 --> 00:15:40.985]  People are just unbelievable racists and self-haters.
[00:15:40.985 --> 00:15:44.049]  But that's okay, because see, it's okay to say white people are evil.
[00:15:47.099 --> 00:15:48.520]  And it's a good distraction.
[00:15:48.520 --> 00:15:57.623]  They can play the lower classes, made up of black, white, Hispanic, Asian, doesn't matter, off against Rich Whitey, who's really the white guy that just happens to have a good job.
[00:15:57.623 --> 00:16:08.127]  And then, you know, the working classes all think the elite is the person in the $300,000 house driving the $50,000 car, never discovering David Rockefeller, the Rothschilds, the New World Order.
[00:16:10.848 --> 00:16:13.429]  Here's another Bloomberg headline.
[00:16:13.429 --> 00:16:19.233]  Mayo says loan losses will exceed depression levels.
[00:16:19.233 --> 00:16:30.779]  Mike Mayo, who left Deutsche Bank AG last month and joined CLSA, assigned an underweight rating to U.S.
[00:16:30.779 --> 00:16:36.203]  banks and predicted loan losses will exceed levels from the Great Depression.
[00:16:37.079 --> 00:16:38.020]  You hear that?
[00:16:38.020 --> 00:16:42.584]  Loan losses will exceed levels from the Great Depression.
[00:16:42.584 --> 00:16:45.166]  And so they'll just take money from U.S.
[00:16:45.166 --> 00:16:51.711]  taxpayers and just give it to the banks and say, you're not allowed to lose money as offshore corporations that don't pay U.S.
[00:16:51.711 --> 00:16:53.533]  taxes.
[00:16:53.533 --> 00:16:56.235]  Here are people who are all losing their jobs.
[00:16:56.235 --> 00:16:58.877]  They will make sure you get billion dollar bonuses.
[00:16:58.877 --> 00:16:59.478]  How does that sound?
[00:17:00.672 --> 00:17:00.952]  U.S.
[00:17:00.952 --> 00:17:15.163]  stocks dropped after Mayo gave sell ratings to banks including Winston-Salem, North Carolina-based BB&T Corp., Cincinnati Fifth Third Largest Bank Corp., Bank of America Corp., and JPMorgan Chase, the two biggest U.S.
[00:17:15.163 --> 00:17:22.108]  banks by assets, were assigned underperformed ratings, Mayo said in a report today.
[00:17:22.108 --> 00:17:23.149]  And he goes on to say,
[00:17:24.548 --> 00:17:28.236]  That this will be the greatest bank losses since the Great Depression.
[00:17:28.236 --> 00:17:30.440]  Yeah, well the banks are just front companies.
[00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:33.927]  They've already moved the real assets out the back door to the New World Order people.
[00:17:34.755 --> 00:17:37.297]  to the private holdings in Europe.
[00:17:37.297 --> 00:17:37.977]  Here's another one.
[00:17:37.977 --> 00:17:45.282]  Gettner may oust more executives at banks needing exceptional aid and other corporations.
[00:17:45.282 --> 00:17:51.005]  So, you know, firing the head of GM, just saying they're going to take over the whole economy.
[00:17:51.005 --> 00:17:56.509]  We're going into IMF, World Bank, Ex-Im Bank, International Bank of Settlements receivership.
[00:17:58.311 --> 00:18:03.492]  Some of the other news, riot cops killed newspaper seller at G20.
[00:18:03.492 --> 00:18:07.493]  You notice you heard that, oh, a guy had a heart attack and fell down and died.
[00:18:07.493 --> 00:18:19.776]  Well, now photographers and media are reporting that they saw him being beaten by police with billy clubs in a pool of blood and that he then died of a heart attack.
[00:18:19.776 --> 00:18:23.957]  So, nobody's going to mourn for him.
[00:18:25.697 --> 00:18:31.339]  The cops go into these frenzies, just like the girl at the Red Sox Championship a few years ago.
[00:18:31.339 --> 00:18:37.581]  She walks out of a bar, they shoot her from five feet away with a rubber bullet, blowing her eye back into her head.
[00:18:37.581 --> 00:18:41.102]  She bleeds to death right there on the cement.
[00:18:41.102 --> 00:18:43.883]  And the cops just said, just doing our job.
[00:18:43.883 --> 00:18:48.945]  Yeah, shooting somebody at five feet away with a rubber bullet in the face.
[00:18:48.945 --> 00:18:51.526]  Just the wrong person at the wrong place at the wrong time.
[00:18:54.249 --> 00:19:02.853]  Meanwhile, newspapers are in the process of collapsing, or are collapsing, all over the United States.
[00:19:02.853 --> 00:19:03.513]  Times Co.
[00:19:03.513 --> 00:19:09.135]  threatens to shut down Globe, the Boston Globe owned by the New York Times.
[00:19:09.135 --> 00:19:15.478]  They're threatening to just shut them down unless workers give $20 million in concessions, union leaders say.
[00:19:15.478 --> 00:19:22.201]  So, well, just keep spewing propaganda and lies and nobody's going to want to read you and you'll collapse that much faster, Boston Globe.
[00:19:23.686 --> 00:19:25.447]  And that leads me to the next issue.
[00:19:25.447 --> 00:19:29.488]  You know, folks love watching a train wreck.
[00:19:29.488 --> 00:19:32.930]  That's why for the Sunday radio show we can gauge the internet audience.
[00:19:32.930 --> 00:19:36.031]  You can't gauge the MNFM until ratings come out.
[00:19:36.031 --> 00:19:39.153]  Record audience yesterday on the Sunday show.
[00:19:39.153 --> 00:19:42.414]  No doubt to hear about this.
[00:19:42.414 --> 00:19:46.716]  Suspect in officer shooting was into conspiracy theories.
[00:19:48.582 --> 00:19:57.948]  And yes, we have Media Matters, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, Raw Story, everybody blaming me for the dead cops.
[00:19:57.948 --> 00:20:01.910]  We'll be right back.
[00:20:01.910 --> 00:20:07.433]  With our economy spiraling out of control, living in the soup kitchens may be right around the corner.
[00:20:07.433 --> 00:20:10.455]  No one saw the financial collapse of 1929.
[00:20:10.455 --> 00:20:15.918]  Many didn't make it, and millions ended up in soup lines, becoming vagrants, begging for food.
[00:20:16.670 --> 00:20:20.313]  Unlike 1929, we can see this collapse coming.
[00:20:20.313 --> 00:20:21.614]  We have been warned.
[00:20:21.614 --> 00:20:28.621]  And right now, we have a very small window of opportunity to get food storage into our homes before it's too late.
[00:20:28.621 --> 00:20:31.823]  Why is the Canadian government telling their citizens to stock up?
[00:20:31.823 --> 00:20:32.264]  Why?
[00:20:32.264 --> 00:20:36.247]  And why are soldiers calling home telling their families to get food storage?
[00:20:36.247 --> 00:20:36.948]  Supplies are
[00:20:37.788 --> 00:20:44.291]  Having food storage today may be just as important to your family's survival as boarding the Ark was in the days of Noah.

[00:21:00.200 --> 00:21:06.523]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:21:07.094 --> 00:21:14.659]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[00:21:14.659 --> 00:21:21.244]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:21:21.244 --> 00:21:23.225]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:21:23.225 --> 00:21:25.727]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:21:25.727 --> 00:21:36.534]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:21:37.299 --> 00:21:38.961]  It's not about left or right.
[00:21:38.961 --> 00:21:40.823]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:21:40.823 --> 00:21:47.750]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[00:21:56.018 --> 00:21:57.599]  The Obama Deception.
[00:21:57.599 --> 00:21:58.781]  The people strike back.
[00:22:00.706 --> 00:22:07.388]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[00:22:07.388 --> 00:22:15.491]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[00:22:15.491 --> 00:22:23.674]  Is this a flaw-free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[00:22:23.674 --> 00:22:28.416]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[00:22:28.755 --> 00:22:33.979]  Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[00:22:33.979 --> 00:22:38.322]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[00:22:38.322 --> 00:22:39.422]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.

[00:24:11.897 --> 00:24:16.460]  Look out your window, babe, and have a scene you'd like to catch.
[00:24:16.460 --> 00:24:20.743]  Mandy's playing Dixie, man got his hand outstands.
[00:24:20.743 --> 00:24:26.467]  Could be the viola, could be the local priest.
[00:24:40.051 --> 00:24:45.175]  We got sweet gifts to give, we got harmonious time.
[00:24:45.175 --> 00:24:52.741]  Though every song of love that ever has been sung, pretty intentions can be evil.
[00:24:52.741 --> 00:24:59.406]  Both hands can be full of reason.
[00:24:59.406 --> 00:25:00.947]  Though there's sometimes,
[00:25:04.841 --> 00:25:24.513]  Okay, so remember back when the Feds bombed the Oklahoma City building in 1995 to demonize the state's rights movement with states declaring sovereignty under the 10th Amendment and saying they were going to take control back over the federal government they created as the 10th and 9th Amendment clearly state is our right and our duty.
[00:25:24.513 --> 00:25:31.077]  And Oklahoma was leading the charge so the Feds on record blew that building to bits with bombs inside and outside the building.
[00:25:33.393 --> 00:25:51.886]  And then it came out in federal FBI documents through lawsuits that the Associated Press and the two major papers in Salt Lake City covered with the Trinidad case that the Southern Poverty Law Center was running the Elohim City white supremacist compound where the bombing was supposedly hatched.
[00:25:51.886 --> 00:25:55.049]  Not infiltrating, running the stinking thing.
[00:25:56.087 --> 00:26:07.293]  And then in sworn affidavits, out of the federal prisons with Terry Nichols, that McVeigh was a special forces operator, sent in to, quote, set up militias with the bombing.
[00:26:07.293 --> 00:26:09.794]  But you saw how they treated their patsy.
[00:26:09.794 --> 00:26:12.135]  What they did with him.
[00:26:12.135 --> 00:26:16.997]  So a very nasty group of people, to say the least.
[00:26:16.997 --> 00:26:23.701]  And they claim that Rush Limbaugh, remember we've got to shut down talk radio, we've got to control free speech, we've got to do it now.
[00:26:24.983 --> 00:26:33.792]  Meanwhile, Obama has introduced a bill that even Mother Jones Magazine, very liberal, but they admit, will basically take over the Internet and begin shutting it down.
[00:26:33.792 --> 00:26:39.718]  This on the heels of Senator Jay Rockefeller saying two weeks ago, we'd be better off if we never had the Internet.
[00:26:39.718 --> 00:26:43.421]  We've got to get rid of it, basically, as the New York Times said.
[00:26:43.421 --> 00:26:48.867]  Quote, have gatekeepers and Internet 2 and a kindler, gentler Internet for your safety with less freedom.
[00:26:51.758 --> 00:26:54.139]  So that's what this is all about.
[00:26:54.139 --> 00:26:56.519]  That's what this attack on myself and others.
[00:26:56.519 --> 00:26:59.100]  Glenn Beck has been attacked because of this mass shooter.
[00:26:59.100 --> 00:27:02.101]  Well, he shot three cops.
[00:27:02.101 --> 00:27:04.841]  Shot five total, killed three.
[00:27:04.841 --> 00:27:15.444]  Yes, Glenn Beck, Media Matters and Raw Story and a bunch of others are saying it's Glenn Beck's fault this shooter in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania
[00:27:16.684 --> 00:27:25.189]  did this because Glenn Beck has been lying saying Barack Obama wants to confiscate guns.
[00:27:25.189 --> 00:27:27.351]  Barack Obama is on record
[00:27:29.617 --> 00:27:31.458]  As a state senator and in the U.S.
[00:27:31.458 --> 00:27:36.139]  Senate voting for a total assault weapons ban.
[00:27:36.139 --> 00:27:37.960]  Anything semi-automatic.
[00:27:37.960 --> 00:27:44.663]  He lobbied and argued for a complete gun ban when he was a state senator in Illinois.
[00:27:44.663 --> 00:27:53.366]  His attorney general last year filed on behalf of the Justice Department when he was just a former deputy attorney general
[00:27:54.722 --> 00:28:00.444]  The briefing you can read on the government's behalf at the Supreme Court on the D.C.
[00:28:00.444 --> 00:28:07.766]  gun ban saying no citizen should be allowed to even own a single-shot shotgun or handgun.
[00:28:07.766 --> 00:28:09.827]  No firearms, period.
[00:28:09.827 --> 00:28:11.367]  Only police and military.
[00:28:11.367 --> 00:28:13.188]  You can go read that right now.
[00:28:13.188 --> 00:28:14.649]  It's in the Supreme Court briefing.
[00:28:14.649 --> 00:28:15.909]  It's on the Supreme Court website.
[00:28:17.785 --> 00:28:19.446]  Eric Holder is on record.
[00:28:19.446 --> 00:28:29.472]  So, all Glenn Beck does, and you know we're normally not defending Glenn Beck here, all Glenn Beck does is say, yes, they're moving to confiscate firearms, this is what they want to do.
[00:28:30.942 --> 00:28:33.104]  And then somebody gets scared of that.
[00:28:33.104 --> 00:28:38.948]  Somebody gets upset about that who's lost their job, who is unstable clearly, who was in the Marines.
[00:28:38.948 --> 00:28:41.590]  Boy, that's always a threat in this.
[00:28:41.590 --> 00:28:47.595]  Trained to kill, trained to get rid of his inhibitions, and have instinctive shooting, instinctive killing.
[00:28:47.595 --> 00:28:49.697]  If you do not kill, you will be dead, Marine!
[00:28:53.905 --> 00:28:55.406]  And I'm not blaming the Marines for this.
[00:28:55.406 --> 00:28:57.387]  The point is, it's an ingredient.
[00:28:57.387 --> 00:29:01.050]  And then he gets in a fight with Mommy because his dog is urinating all over the floor.
[00:29:01.050 --> 00:29:03.552]  He's 22 years old, out of work.
[00:29:03.552 --> 00:29:07.194]  The cops come, he throws a fit and guns two of them down the doorway of his house.
[00:29:07.194 --> 00:29:17.341]  Another one comes, he kills him, runs upstairs, gets shot up by other police that arrives, shoots a couple of them, the police back off.
[00:29:17.341 --> 00:29:19.303]  And they try to tie it into Glenn Beck.
[00:29:19.303 --> 00:29:20.464]  But they didn't stop there!
[00:29:21.704 --> 00:29:22.164]  Oh no!
[00:29:22.164 --> 00:29:25.406]  They had to bring Alex Jones into it!
[00:29:25.406 --> 00:29:27.567]  Evil Alex Jones!
[00:29:27.567 --> 00:29:41.753]  Because this guy's friends say that he had visited PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com and RawStory says that I make up all this stuff about gun control and about troops on the streets.
[00:29:41.753 --> 00:29:42.193]  Really?
[00:29:42.193 --> 00:29:44.094]  I read out of the Army Times on air?
[00:29:44.094 --> 00:29:47.576]  I read the Supreme Court filings by the Justice Department?
[00:29:47.576 --> 00:29:49.157]  You mean I read?
[00:29:49.157 --> 00:29:49.657]  How dare I?
[00:29:50.819 --> 00:29:54.749]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.749 --> 00:29:57.435]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[00:31:00.140 --> 00:31:06.908]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:31:07.700 --> 00:31:13.564]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[00:31:13.564 --> 00:31:20.069]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:31:20.069 --> 00:31:22.050]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:31:22.050 --> 00:31:24.512]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:31:24.512 --> 00:31:35.400]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.

[00:34:16.121 --> 00:34:19.922]  Number one in the war against the globalists.
[00:34:19.922 --> 00:34:21.543]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:34:21.543 --> 00:34:29.886]  You have found the tip of the spear of the front lines in the InfoWar.
[00:34:29.886 --> 00:34:36.349]  Okay, so two people have been chosen out of this tragedy to be demonized.
[00:34:36.349 --> 00:34:37.649]  Two people mainly.
[00:34:37.649 --> 00:34:38.690]  Myself and Glenn Beck.
[00:34:40.325 --> 00:34:51.249]  By Media Matters, run by Mr. Brock, a former neocon, by Raw Story, and by, of course, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.
[00:34:51.249 --> 00:34:56.551]  Now, do they talk about how we have these tens of millions of immigrants that keep committing crimes?
[00:34:56.551 --> 00:35:02.993]  Like the individual that killed 14 people, including himself, in upstate New York, throwing a fit because he was jobless?
[00:35:04.670 --> 00:35:14.422]  Do they discuss why do we have a phenomenon now of people committing suicide when they lose their jobs, but not just committing suicide, taking others with them?
[00:35:14.422 --> 00:35:21.031]  Is there a discussion about how violent video games, every study shows, destroy the inhibition against committing murder?
[00:35:22.614 --> 00:35:24.516]  No, there's no discussion about that.
[00:35:24.516 --> 00:35:31.421]  No, instead, out of the mass shootings, there have been five since last Friday.
[00:35:31.421 --> 00:35:39.247]  All over the nation, fathers lose their jobs, so they go home to the house and they blow their wife and children's heads off.
[00:35:39.247 --> 00:35:42.890]  Or they stab them to death, or they burn them to death.
[00:35:42.890 --> 00:35:45.131]  I mean, what is going on here?
[00:35:45.131 --> 00:35:46.953]  The breakdown of society.
[00:35:48.649 --> 00:35:50.850]  I mean, I could have, you know, no money.
[00:35:50.850 --> 00:35:52.411]  I could have my legs chopped off.
[00:35:52.411 --> 00:35:54.273]  I could be totally depressed.
[00:35:54.273 --> 00:35:56.934]  It would never enter my mind to kill my family.
[00:35:56.934 --> 00:36:05.820]  But that's what happens in this jealous, covetous, lazy, demonic society.
[00:36:05.820 --> 00:36:09.242]  You know, the establishment doesn't care about killing 50 million babies with abortion.
[00:36:10.452 --> 00:36:39.382]  They don't care about killing a million three hundred thousand iraqis that's all that's those brown people let them die well what do you expect is going to happen here at home now a lot of this is overblown because there are three hundred plus million three hundred plus million people in this country and statistically uh... less police are killed today than were killed just a few decades ago statistically there are less shootings according to the justice department in two thousand eight and there were in the year two thousand crime began dropping
[00:36:40.339 --> 00:36:43.540]  Precipitously in what, 1991?
[00:36:43.540 --> 00:36:49.301]  From its height in 1987 during the peak of the crack cocaine epidemic.
[00:36:49.301 --> 00:37:02.744]  But whereas you have less liquor store robberies and deaths and less bank robbery shootouts and less gang shootouts because they basically killed themselves, killed each other off, there is statistically more
[00:37:03.664 --> 00:37:12.877]  They just make up a smaller part, so the overall number's down, of just completely crazy people running around, killing, stabbing, burning, shooting their fellow man.
[00:37:14.369 --> 00:37:20.550]  And a lot of that is the mainstream media advertising these shootings and promoting them and hyping them.
[00:37:20.550 --> 00:37:27.852]  And then copycats hear this and go, well, I lost my job, I'm depressed, I'm feeling nasty, I'm having a dirty day.
[00:37:27.852 --> 00:37:36.413]  You know, that's what I call it when you feel all grungy and angry and, you know, not just depressed, but just grungy.
[00:37:36.413 --> 00:37:39.094]  That happens to me maybe once every two or three years.
[00:37:39.094 --> 00:37:40.894]  I'm told a lot of people feel like that every day.
[00:37:42.449 --> 00:37:47.032]  Of course, when I do feel like that, I go out and go for a 10-mile hike.
[00:37:47.032 --> 00:37:50.835]  Cures it every time.
[00:37:50.835 --> 00:37:53.577]  Or go out and, you know, join the Golden Gloves or something.
[00:37:53.577 --> 00:37:59.501]  Go to a local boxing club and get your head beat in and see how you like it.
[00:37:59.501 --> 00:38:01.683]  That'll get rid of your depression real fast.
[00:38:01.683 --> 00:38:03.304]  But I'm already digressing.
[00:38:03.304 --> 00:38:05.446]  The issue here is that
[00:38:10.475 --> 00:38:30.487]  Well, I mean, this goes into so many areas, not just why this guy did what he did or where society's going, but how the mainstream media and the controlled corporate media is trying to tie it to talk radio and free speech to go after free speech with this new McCarthyism in the United States.
[00:38:30.487 --> 00:38:32.268]  You see, it's my fault
[00:38:33.666 --> 00:38:43.733]  That this guy killed three cops, according to several newspapers, because I talk about how Obama is anti-Second Amendment.
[00:38:43.733 --> 00:38:55.922]  Well, by that flawed logic, it's Barack Obama's fault that when he was a state senator, he called for total gun bans in Illinois, all guns to be banned.
[00:38:55.922 --> 00:38:56.702]  That's on record.
[00:38:56.702 --> 00:38:57.583]  Or that when he was a U.S.
[00:38:57.583 --> 00:39:01.886]  senator, he voted for some of the most draconian laws ever against the Second Amendment at the federal level.
[00:39:03.228 --> 00:39:07.210]  Or that his Chief of Staff is for an open, total gun ban on the American people.
[00:39:07.210 --> 00:39:22.118]  Or that Eric Holder, on record before the Supreme Court, you can go pull it up, we've read it on air, filed a briefing saying we are for the total abolition of quote, civilian ownership of firearms only the police and military should own.
[00:39:22.118 --> 00:39:26.661]  But see, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette calls that a conspiracy theory.
[00:39:26.661 --> 00:39:28.662]  Raw Story calls that a conspiracy theory.
[00:39:33.027 --> 00:39:51.192]  Media Matters calls that a conspiracy theory and calls me a nut because I happen to know how to read government documents.
[00:39:51.192 --> 00:40:00.434]  I happen to know how to go over to the Supreme Court website and read the briefings, both pro and con, for the Second Amendment.
[00:40:01.607 --> 00:40:05.691]  I happen to have Larry Pratt and many other Second Amendment group leaders on.
[00:40:05.691 --> 00:40:14.099]  Aaron Zellman, who's the President of Firearms Ownership, on to read their filings on air.
[00:40:14.099 --> 00:40:23.287]  And so because I am informed, and I don't just go to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette and other newspapers for my news and information, I am bad.
[00:40:25.868 --> 00:40:32.191]  I'm also being attacked by little green footballs, also run by a quote, former liberal, now a neocon.
[00:40:37.651 --> 00:40:42.554]  So we'll go over some of that, but again, I'm not covering this because it's about Alex Jones.
[00:40:42.554 --> 00:40:48.357]  This is an attack on everyone who believes in the Second Amendment and who holds it dear as the bedrock of freedom and liberty.
[00:40:48.357 --> 00:41:04.587]  This is also an attack on the First Amendment, free speech, because they're calling to shut down freedom on the internet, freedom on talk radio, the bills have been introduced, the chairman of the committee that's over at J. Rockefeller says he wants it, the New York Times, everybody's pushing for it, and so the fight is on.
[00:41:05.461 --> 00:41:16.044]  And they'll use people like me, who they see as extreme, who they think will scare middle America into going along with this.
[00:41:16.044 --> 00:41:27.788]  Or at least go along with it enough to stand down and not speak up and say no to having free speech butchered.
[00:41:27.788 --> 00:41:34.210]  Also, Raw Story attacks me and says that I'm this delusional, off-the-wall person
[00:41:35.506 --> 00:41:49.681]  Who claimed that they were going to put troops on the streets of America, and so that scared the 22-year-old unemployed Richard Popolosky.
[00:41:49.681 --> 00:41:56.928]  And so because I lied about that, because I made that up, because I talked, because I had free speech, that that made him
[00:41:58.755 --> 00:42:03.476]  When his mommy called the police on him and he threw a fit and killed the cops, that's what this was.
[00:42:03.476 --> 00:42:05.997]  This was impulse control problem.
[00:42:05.997 --> 00:42:08.177]  This was a rage problem.
[00:42:08.177 --> 00:42:13.838]  This was a, police will tell you, the most dangerous thing to go to are these domestic disputes.
[00:42:13.838 --> 00:42:17.239]  That's when cops get killed most often.
[00:42:17.239 --> 00:42:19.039]  It's not bank robbery shootouts.
[00:42:19.039 --> 00:42:20.900]  It's not side of the road shootouts.
[00:42:20.900 --> 00:42:22.140]  It's domestic disputes.
[00:42:23.632 --> 00:42:33.541]  The woman will call the police, the police get there, they start putting her drunken husband in handcuffs, the woman will pull a gun out and shoot the cops or run up and stab them with a knife.
[00:42:33.541 --> 00:42:37.004]  Happens every day in this country, you see it in the news.
[00:42:37.004 --> 00:42:39.546]  So it's the domestic disputes the main thing.
[00:42:39.546 --> 00:42:48.815]  And then yes, Obama's actions, calling for total gun bans, and the mainstream news announcing, CNN, you name it, that they're putting troops on the streets.
[00:42:50.600 --> 00:42:58.925]  That whacked this former Marine out who was also hopeless over losing his job and having to move in with Mommy.
[00:42:58.925 --> 00:43:01.027]  And so what happened?
[00:43:01.027 --> 00:43:06.390]  The police came out thinking they were responding to a normal dispute and got killed and it's a tragedy.
[00:43:06.390 --> 00:43:14.856]  And this is slander, this is libel, this is an attempt through guilt by association
[00:43:16.260 --> 00:43:18.501]  To say, well, what's on somebody's bookshelf?
[00:43:18.501 --> 00:43:19.922]  What were they reading?
[00:43:19.922 --> 00:43:21.382]  What were they doing?
[00:43:21.382 --> 00:43:27.665]  Oh my God, Alex Jones, listening to Alex Jones is like the new Turner Diaries.
[00:43:27.665 --> 00:43:31.486]  Well, the Turner Diaries calls for killing police.
[00:43:31.486 --> 00:43:35.888]  And it talks about what the second revolution is going to look like from a white supremacist view.
[00:43:35.888 --> 00:43:39.290]  We are completely aligned against that on record.
[00:43:40.296 --> 00:43:43.397]  And are calling for non-violent protest against this tyranny.
[00:43:43.397 --> 00:43:44.277]  But see, they don't care.
[00:43:44.277 --> 00:43:48.918]  They want to make listening to Alex Jones to be the new Turner Diaries.
[00:43:48.918 --> 00:43:50.118]  Oh my gosh!
[00:43:50.118 --> 00:43:51.999]  You listen to Alex Jones.
[00:43:51.999 --> 00:43:58.620]  Now, this may help the establishment a little bit, but this is kind of an old trick from the 80s and 90s.
[00:43:58.620 --> 00:44:00.400]  And it's really failing.
[00:44:00.400 --> 00:44:03.261]  But overall, it's only helping this radio show.
[00:44:03.261 --> 00:44:06.502]  Man, this is that radical, hardcore radio show
[00:44:07.302 --> 00:44:22.911]  That, uh, you know, is so influential and so dark and cutting edge and shocking that it leaves a wake of dead cops in its, uh, in its thrall.
[00:44:22.911 --> 00:44:29.214]  And so, we look at just the internet numbers alone, record listenership today.
[00:44:29.214 --> 00:44:31.696]  It's disgusting.
[00:44:31.696 --> 00:44:35.758]  And Kurt Nemo wrote a story Saturday
[00:44:37.268 --> 00:45:02.959]  night defending me and it went up for a few minutes and I called him and I said take it down I said right now this story is only in one newspaper tying the killings to me I said I don't want publicity off of this and Kurt's like oh absolutely no I'm just defending you and I said I know it's the right thing to do but wait and see if this gets picked up all over the place because I don't want the publicity off this from dead cops
[00:45:05.219 --> 00:45:08.781]  And then I called him Sunday evening and I said, go ahead and put it up.
[00:45:08.781 --> 00:45:10.482]  It's all over the place.
[00:45:10.482 --> 00:45:18.426]  The media is getting publicity against the Second Amendment and against free speech off the hides of these three dead police officers.
[00:45:18.426 --> 00:45:21.047]  These three dead heroes.
[00:45:21.047 --> 00:45:31.312]  Who laid down their life, their lives, for this spoiled rotten sack of crap.
[00:45:31.312 --> 00:45:34.114]  Who was so spoiled that when mommy told him get out of the house,
[00:45:36.038 --> 00:45:41.000]  He didn't say, yes mom, and pack his crap up and leave.
[00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:47.443]  And so when the cops came, instead of getting in his car with the guns or leaving with them or leaving the guns for the cops, he sat there and killed them.
[00:45:47.443 --> 00:45:53.686]  This is not the police going door to door down the street at checkpoints confiscating everybody's guns.
[00:45:53.686 --> 00:45:57.608]  If that happens, it's 1776 and it starts, folks.
[00:45:57.608 --> 00:45:59.829]  And then we're in the right defending ourselves.
[00:45:59.829 --> 00:46:02.831]  But no, your dog is pissing on the rug
[00:46:05.475 --> 00:46:07.396]  You live with mommy at 22 years old.
[00:46:07.396 --> 00:46:09.377]  You've lost your job.
[00:46:09.377 --> 00:46:10.178]  It's her house.
[00:46:10.178 --> 00:46:12.519]  If you're going to live there, you live there under her rules.
[00:46:12.519 --> 00:46:15.801]  No!
[00:46:15.801 --> 00:46:17.382]  No, she tells you get rid of the dog.
[00:46:17.382 --> 00:46:20.223]  This is what now the Associated Press reports happened.
[00:46:20.223 --> 00:46:21.444]  You say no to it.
[00:46:24.181 --> 00:46:28.505]  And then you throw a fit waiting to kill cops when they come.
[00:46:28.505 --> 00:46:29.926]  You're gonna show mommy.
[00:46:29.926 --> 00:46:31.748]  You're gonna show her who's boss.
[00:46:31.748 --> 00:46:33.229]  And we've all been teenagers before.
[00:46:33.229 --> 00:46:41.696]  I can't believe this guy's twenty-something years old and thrown a fit once or twice or tumped the refrigerator over or kicked a hole in the wall.
[00:46:41.696 --> 00:46:47.762]  And the biggest thing I can tell young people in this situation is you're gonna be a lot happier when you move out of your parents' house.
[00:46:47.762 --> 00:46:49.023]  I don't care if you gotta live in a shack.
[00:46:50.404 --> 00:46:51.765]  That's normal and natural.
[00:46:51.765 --> 00:46:53.265]  Get out of your parents' house.
[00:46:53.265 --> 00:46:56.667]  Now, if your parents are disabled or something and need your help, that's another thing.
[00:46:56.667 --> 00:47:00.089]  Or if you've got your own job, build a house next to them and raise your kids, that's good.
[00:47:00.089 --> 00:47:01.830]  Move out for a few years, though, and come back.
[00:47:01.830 --> 00:47:05.932]  The whole issue is this not having a job, sitting in mommy's house.
[00:47:05.932 --> 00:47:07.713]  It's a recipe for disaster.
[00:47:07.713 --> 00:47:12.615]  And for any young people out there listening, your parents get in your face, just leave.
[00:47:12.615 --> 00:47:13.816]  Your wife gets in your face.
[00:47:13.816 --> 00:47:16.577]  You start having a fight, leave.
[00:47:16.577 --> 00:47:18.238]  It's best to de-escalate things.
[00:47:20.359 --> 00:47:24.502]  You know, I had girlfriends, many of them, who'd go wild, start punching me or whatever.
[00:47:24.502 --> 00:47:27.624]  I learned to just leave, folks.
[00:47:27.624 --> 00:47:31.067]  Because this is how America's spoiled rotten now.
[00:47:31.067 --> 00:47:32.568]  And this is what goes on.
[00:47:32.568 --> 00:47:41.975]  Because your girlfriend starts slapping you or scratching you, and you punch her in the face or throw her on the ground, she's gonna call the cops on you and your life's over.
[00:47:41.975 --> 00:47:43.136]  Just leave.
[00:47:45.063 --> 00:47:47.324]  That's how you win these arguments.
[00:47:47.324 --> 00:47:54.768]  But no, she calls the cops, he gets all fired up, oh my God, they're coming for his guns.
[00:47:54.768 --> 00:47:57.170]  He lies in wait, he kills them.
[00:47:57.170 --> 00:47:59.691]  It's a domestic dispute.
[00:47:59.691 --> 00:48:09.276]  About 70% of this happened because this young man had no impulse control and because he'd been in the Marines and been trained to not have an inhibition against killing.
[00:48:09.276 --> 00:48:12.398]  They train you to have the killer instinct and to hone that and sharpen it.
[00:48:13.376 --> 00:48:14.276]  That's 70% of this.
[00:48:14.276 --> 00:48:19.899]  The other 30% or so is the fact that he lost his job.
[00:48:19.899 --> 00:48:28.264]  Just like the other four mass shootings we've had in the last three days, four days, have been people losing their jobs.
[00:48:28.264 --> 00:48:37.368]  They get this feeling of hopelessness, they get this feeling of worthlessness, they think their life's over, their wife's screaming at them, and it always happens the same.
[00:48:37.368 --> 00:48:42.391]  They put a bullet in their wife, then they're freaking out and throw a fit, and then they gun their kids down.
[00:48:43.831 --> 00:48:44.813]  Hey, let me tell you something.
[00:48:44.813 --> 00:48:47.958]  Before you ever kill your wife or kids, do yourself a favor.
[00:48:47.958 --> 00:48:51.665]  Go out in the backyard and blow your own stinking head off.
[00:48:51.665 --> 00:48:56.493]  It's bad enough to kill yourself, but you should never even let it enter your mind.
[00:48:58.905 --> 00:49:00.227]  to kill your wife and family.
[00:49:00.227 --> 00:49:01.668]  So your wife's divorced you.
[00:49:01.668 --> 00:49:02.709]  So she's taking the kids.
[00:49:02.709 --> 00:49:06.233]  She's living with some young guy on your paycheck.
[00:49:06.233 --> 00:49:07.935]  That's just the way it is.
[00:49:07.935 --> 00:49:09.497]  Still love your children.
[00:49:09.497 --> 00:49:11.139]  Just forgive your ex-wife.
[00:49:11.139 --> 00:49:15.184]  Don't go to the house dressed up like Santa Claus, drunk, and kill everybody.
[00:49:19.537 --> 00:49:38.845]  But what the media and the police are doing is they're combing over all these dozens of mass shootings and they're looking for people who have Ron Paul material or Glenn Beck material or Alex Jones material so they can try to bolster their whole Mayak view of the world, which by the way is going to get a lot of cops killed.
[00:49:38.845 --> 00:49:45.508]  If the police implement this Mayak view, we get calls every day of people pulled over for Ron Paul stickers, the cops are pulling guns out on them.
[00:49:46.607 --> 00:49:56.929]  That then makes the public scared of the cops and paranoid and then they're going to react like this guy did to the police and military.
[00:49:56.929 --> 00:50:10.012]  And that's the most important thing I can say about all of this is that the police have been trained to be an us-against-them mentality and that they're all alone with the public against them.
[00:50:10.012 --> 00:50:14.873]  And the federal government and the ADL, the Southern Poverty Law Center, and all these groups
[00:50:16.189 --> 00:50:22.436]  spend all their time trying to separate the military and the police from the people when our interests are the same.
[00:50:23.291 --> 00:50:24.512]  We're the American people.
[00:50:24.512 --> 00:50:35.941]  We have these offshore criminal banks who openly finance the ADL and Southern Poverty Law Center to demonize the Patriot Movement to then make the Patriot Movement an enemy of the police and military.
[00:50:35.941 --> 00:50:49.892]  And yes, the Patriot Movement is buying that view and is buying that system and so are the police and so they've got us squaring off against each other in battle lines so we'll kill each other instead of bringing the bankers to justice.
[00:50:50.970 --> 00:50:52.110]  And that's the key to all this.
[00:50:52.110 --> 00:50:54.151]  I'm going to keep covering it when we get back.
[00:50:54.151 --> 00:50:57.192]  And then coming up, the big Concentration Camp Expo.
[00:50:57.192 --> 00:51:00.933]  Stay with us.
[00:51:00.933 --> 00:51:09.175]  This year, many of us will have to make the tough decision on what to cut back on and what's essential as we prepare for an uncertain future.
[00:51:09.175 --> 00:51:13.736]  In these troubled times, one of the most important things your family can have is good health.
[00:51:13.736 --> 00:51:18.418]  Some of the contributors to poor health are parasites, viruses, toxins, and heavy metals.
[00:51:18.418 --> 00:51:19.818]  It's a documented fact.
[00:51:19.858 --> 00:51:20.259]  We're good to go!
[00:51:38.761 --> 00:51:43.824]  Once a day, FPP is now available to you from FreshwaterOrganics.com.
[00:51:43.824 --> 00:51:46.966]  A two-month supply starts at just $17.
[00:51:46.966 --> 00:51:50.709]  FPP is so affordable you can't afford to do without.
[00:51:50.709 --> 00:51:54.211]  Visit FreshwaterOrganics.com or call them toll-free at 888-949-3570.
[00:51:54.211 --> 00:51:54.611]  That's 888-949-3570.
[00:51:54.611 --> 00:51:58.353]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:52:07.435 --> 00:52:15.020]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[00:52:15.020 --> 00:52:21.585]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:52:21.585 --> 00:52:23.566]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:52:23.566 --> 00:52:26.088]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:52:26.088 --> 00:52:37.036]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:52:37.657 --> 00:52:39.319]  It's not about left or right.
[00:52:39.319 --> 00:52:41.181]  It's about a one world government.
[00:52:41.181 --> 00:52:48.088]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:52:48.088 --> 00:52:56.357]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at Infowars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:52:56.357 --> 00:52:57.938]  The Obama Deception.
[00:52:57.938 --> 00:52:59.140]  The people strike back.
[00:53:00.905 --> 00:53:06.909]  Did you know many vitamin and mineral supplements on the market are made from rocks and ground up shells?
[00:53:06.909 --> 00:53:07.649]  Think about that.
[00:53:07.649 --> 00:53:10.771]  Would you swallow a handful of shells you found at the beach?
[00:53:10.771 --> 00:53:13.993]  Our body wasn't designed to digest rocks and shells.
[00:53:13.993 --> 00:53:23.779]  Hello, my name is Dr. David Friedman, formulator of Chews for Health, a delicious tasting, chewable dietary supplement derived from 16 fruits, vegetables, and antioxidants.
[00:53:24.219 --> 00:53:30.060]  Unlike hard-to-digest pills, Choose for Health is a convenient chewable which allows for better digestion.
[00:53:30.060 --> 00:53:31.221]  The choice is yours.
[00:53:31.221 --> 00:53:36.842]  Swallow rocks and shells to supplement your diet or a natural chewable product you can better digest.
[00:53:36.842 --> 00:53:41.903]  Choose for Health, the world's first superfruit, sea vegetable, antioxidant chewable.
[00:53:41.903 --> 00:53:45.484]  Whole food nutrition, not rocks and shells.
[00:53:45.484 --> 00:53:48.505]  1-800-210-1922.
[00:53:48.505 --> 00:53:52.926]  Call now and receive a free copy of my best-selling CD, America's Unbalanced Diet.

[00:54:12.930 --> 00:54:16.053]  I'm going to have to do about an hour and 40 minutes on the FEMA camps.
[00:54:16.053 --> 00:54:32.607]  I can do it in that time because the guys are in there trying to load about 15, 20 different video clips into the computer for when we start simulcasting at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:54:32.607 --> 00:54:38.071]  Radio listeners will obviously hear the audio.
[00:54:38.071 --> 00:54:39.833]  When I go over the concentration camps,
[00:54:43.004 --> 00:54:46.985]  And their history and what's really been set up in the United States.
[00:54:46.985 --> 00:54:55.527]  They've also got over a hundred news articles that they're getting in order so that as I go over them on air, they can pull them up on screen.
[00:54:55.527 --> 00:55:02.969]  Because I can show the Army's own website where they admit Americans are on 24 camps working as slave labor, and people won't believe it.
[00:55:02.969 --> 00:55:07.630]  So it's best to show the website, show it on screen, and hope that folks will go check it out.
[00:55:11.281 --> 00:55:12.390]  So that's coming up in about 25 minutes.
[00:55:15.731 --> 00:55:16.652]  And why am I doing that?
[00:55:16.652 --> 00:55:21.556]  Glenn Beck said a month ago he was going to expose the FEMA camps and look like they were real.
[00:55:21.556 --> 00:55:31.103]  And I said he's doing that to get your confidence, he's an establishment hack, he's been reading federal talking points right out of the ADL, saying arrest Ron Paul supporters, they're dangerous.
[00:55:31.103 --> 00:55:34.465]  Then he flip-flopped to get our confidence and I said that's what it was.
[00:55:34.465 --> 00:55:37.268]  Watch, he's going to come out and debunk the FEMA camps.
[00:55:37.268 --> 00:55:39.830]  Then he announced a week and a half ago that he's going to do it tonight.
[00:55:39.830 --> 00:55:42.392]  Now he may cancel that again, he's been endlessly hyping this.
[00:55:43.479 --> 00:55:45.921]  But regardless, we're going to expose him.
[00:55:45.921 --> 00:55:49.343]  Now understand, I'm going to show you about 10% of the evidence.
[00:55:49.343 --> 00:56:00.450]  With time constraints, I can only show you a few dozen media clips and news articles and go over them here in the time we have.
[00:56:00.450 --> 00:56:04.873]  And as usual, I'm about a mile deep and
[00:56:06.249 --> 00:56:10.812]  Only a few hundred yards wide, instead of a mile wide and inch deep.
[00:56:10.812 --> 00:56:21.077]  We have so much information, and then such a limited time frame and area to put it all into, but we're going to attempt to do that.
[00:56:21.077 --> 00:56:32.204]  But again, when I saw the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette with the headline, Suspect in Officer Shooting Was Into Conspiracy Theories, and then it attacks me,
[00:56:34.045 --> 00:56:39.567]  And attacks my websites and calls it conspiracy theories, the things I discuss.
[00:56:39.567 --> 00:56:42.028]  I said, look, let's wait and see if this gets big.
[00:56:42.028 --> 00:56:46.129]  I said, this will get us a lot of hype, a lot of attention.
[00:56:46.129 --> 00:56:46.649]  Like P.T.
[00:56:46.649 --> 00:56:49.990]  Barnum said, you know, just spell my name right.
[00:56:49.990 --> 00:57:01.014]  But I don't want that type of attention on the backs of three dead cops and two injured police officers who were out there doing their job and got called to the scene by this young man's wife, mother, excuse me.
[00:57:03.377 --> 00:57:07.238]  And, uh, it's just horrible.
[00:57:07.238 --> 00:57:07.779]  It's senseless.
[00:57:07.779 --> 00:57:10.159]  This was not them coming to confiscate his guns.
[00:57:10.159 --> 00:57:16.722]  This was his mother calling police to throw him out of the house.
[00:57:16.722 --> 00:57:19.543]  And some people are like, yeah, the American Revolution started.
[00:57:19.543 --> 00:57:22.704]  You know, let's start going out and capping police.
[00:57:22.704 --> 00:57:25.965]  That is exactly what the New World Order wants, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:57:27.233 --> 00:57:40.280]  They have spent decades brainwashing the police and military to train them to hate and distrust the American people and true libertarians and paleo-conservatives in this country.
[00:57:40.280 --> 00:57:45.642]  And the establishment's getting scared right now because the police and military are waking up and joining us.
[00:57:45.642 --> 00:57:55.127]  And that's why the media revels in these dead cops and is using their deaths in a sickening fashion to try to get gas mileage against the First Amendment and the Second Amendment.
[00:57:59.059 --> 00:58:01.279]  And I keep warning the police and military.
[00:58:01.279 --> 00:58:05.600]  There are tens of millions of Americans who want to die.
[00:58:05.600 --> 00:58:17.802]  Who are sick of life, and sick of the government, and sick of corruption, and they are just waiting with their firearms to go absolutely ape on anybody in a uniform.
[00:58:17.802 --> 00:58:23.463]  I keep trying to explain this to you, that the New World Order has positioned you as the bad guy.
[00:58:23.463 --> 00:58:26.864]  The news shows the police brutality over and over again.
[00:58:26.864 --> 00:58:27.924]  This is a PSYOP.
[00:58:28.703 --> 00:58:39.546]  And they've got two huge columns of the government and the police marching towards the people, and there's an evil plan behind this, and I'm gonna break it down when we get back.
[00:58:39.546 --> 00:58:45.527]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[00:58:52.375 --> 00:58:57.117]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[00:58:57.117 --> 00:59:00.078]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[00:59:00.078 --> 00:59:03.119]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[00:59:03.119 --> 00:59:07.841]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[00:59:08.021 --> 00:59:08.301]  We're good.

[00:59:53.419 --> 00:59:55.820]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:55.820 --> 01:00:05.324]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.324 --> 01:00:06.644]  Big Brother.
[01:00:06.644 --> 01:00:08.405]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:08.405 --> 01:00:10.165]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:10.165 --> 01:00:11.746]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.746 --> 01:00:13.307]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.307 --> 01:00:17.488]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.488 --> 01:00:21.570]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:25.413 --> 01:00:34.362]  All right, coming up at the 24 After, I'm going to start simulcasting at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:00:34.362 --> 01:00:42.931]  We'll spend an hour and 35 minutes roughly debunking the popular mechanics debunking that's coming up reportedly tonight.
[01:00:44.861 --> 01:00:50.528]  Monday, April 6th on the Glenn Beck Phony Conservative Phony Patriot Program.
[01:00:50.528 --> 01:00:52.551]  So that is coming up this evening.
[01:00:52.551 --> 01:01:03.685]  Okay, here's the most important thing I can say about Raw Story, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, Media Matters, Little Green Football, the Neocon website, all of them.
[01:01:06.869 --> 01:01:18.175]  They are trying to get gas mileage against free speech in the second amendment, the first and second amendment, out of the deaths of these four officers and that's just a despicable, disgusting, horrible thing to do.
[01:01:19.585 --> 01:01:23.987]  You know, I had enough class before this thing became a big national story.
[01:01:23.987 --> 01:01:32.592]  Because, I mean, if I was just a cold-blooded, cynical person that just wanted attention to this show, I would have told my webmasters, make a big deal out of this!
[01:01:32.592 --> 01:01:36.614]  Make sure this goes nationwide by posting it on my websites.
[01:01:36.614 --> 01:01:38.935]  And I said, no, shut it down.
[01:01:38.935 --> 01:01:41.177]  Don't post anything about this.
[01:01:41.177 --> 01:01:45.219]  Because I don't want the attention for my radio show off of this.
[01:01:46.508 --> 01:01:49.550]  But it went big, so now I have to defend myself.
[01:01:49.550 --> 01:01:51.252]  And we are doing that.
[01:01:51.252 --> 01:01:52.373]  That's the sick thing.
[01:01:52.373 --> 01:01:54.995]  No weapon formed against us shall prosper.
[01:01:54.995 --> 01:02:01.079]  I mean, every time I get attacked by the media, the government, low-level people, other patriots, it only makes us bigger.
[01:02:01.079 --> 01:02:03.701]  I mean, have any of you numbskulls figured that out?
[01:02:03.701 --> 01:02:06.584]  And frankly, I don't enjoy how big we're getting.
[01:02:06.584 --> 01:02:15.951]  It's starting to really freak me out that we're reaching tens of millions of people, and that the whole world is starting to pay attention to what we do, and that even the mainstream media is having to admit that.
[01:02:16.351 --> 01:02:19.973]  I mean, I've got an incredible weight on my shoulders.
[01:02:19.973 --> 01:02:21.514]  Because I know this is for real.
[01:02:21.514 --> 01:02:23.375]  I understand this is the real world.
[01:02:23.375 --> 01:02:24.675]  This isn't some game.
[01:02:24.675 --> 01:02:28.317]  This isn't about Alex Jones being a celebrity.
[01:02:28.317 --> 01:02:34.661]  A lot of you wish for that because Madison Avenue has told you that that's the ultimate in life, when in truth it's a cage.
[01:02:34.661 --> 01:02:36.582]  It is a prison.
[01:02:36.582 --> 01:02:41.484]  So be careful what you wish for.
[01:02:41.484 --> 01:02:42.345]  So that said,
[01:02:46.098 --> 01:02:48.339]  The media knows this makes me bigger.
[01:02:48.339 --> 01:02:55.143]  They want to use me as an archetype to demonize the First Amendment and the Second Amendment, and that is disgusting.
[01:02:55.143 --> 01:03:01.226]  That said, it is not Barack Obama's fault, because people can't be governed by what others do.
[01:03:01.226 --> 01:03:06.628]  You know, it was this young man's decision to do what he did, and it's heinous and terrible.
[01:03:06.628 --> 01:03:11.591]  Shooting these three police officers and killing and wounding two others, because mommy was throwing him out of the house.
[01:03:13.291 --> 01:03:27.838]  But it's also heinous to have Barack Obama pushing for total gun bans and having his Attorney General file briefings at the Supreme Court saying so, and to have the mainstream media claim we're making this up and it isn't true.
[01:03:27.838 --> 01:03:32.821]  And I called this Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reporter up and I said, what's your problem, buddy?
[01:03:32.821 --> 01:03:35.622]  What's your deal?
[01:03:35.622 --> 01:03:36.323]  Why are you
[01:03:39.915 --> 01:03:51.464]  Calling me a conspiracy theorist and saying this stuff's basically made up, when you know that the Attorney General called for a total gun ban, and he wouldn't answer that.
[01:03:51.464 --> 01:03:53.906]  So, that's going on.
[01:03:53.906 --> 01:03:57.589]  But the big issue here, the $64 million question, and the $64 million answer is this.
[01:04:03.001 --> 01:04:05.183]  They have turned government against the people.
[01:04:05.183 --> 01:04:07.164]  They have taught the government that the people are bad.
[01:04:07.164 --> 01:04:09.066]  They've taught the people the government's bad.
[01:04:09.066 --> 01:04:15.611]  They hype up bad examples of police and police brutality to further compact the police into a gang mentality.
[01:04:15.611 --> 01:04:21.056]  And to give the police this feeling of invincibility and great power.
[01:04:21.056 --> 01:04:26.941]  And Hollywood has put out the image of police in black uniforms with submachine guns descending on the public.
[01:04:28.328 --> 01:04:36.397]  That in turn scares the public, drives them away from the police, causes an arms race amongst the public, and an arms race amongst the police.
[01:04:36.397 --> 01:04:44.607]  And now they've got us divided as two armies to fight with each other, divide and conquer, instead of bringing the New World Order to justice.
[01:04:44.607 --> 01:04:46.589]  So I'm going to come back and finish up with this.
[01:04:47.290 --> 01:04:55.718]  And then just go through the incredible stories that say, I made up the fact that they're planning to put fribs on the streets, and I make up the New World Order.
[01:04:55.718 --> 01:05:00.303]  Doesn't matter if it's being announced all over international television and print.
[01:05:01.081 --> 01:05:02.543]  So you want to stop smoking.
[01:05:02.543 --> 01:05:03.824]  Well, here's what I want you to do.
[01:05:03.824 --> 01:05:06.707]  Go to a drugstore and take a stop smoking product off the shelf.
[01:05:06.707 --> 01:05:10.712]  Go to the cashier, tell him you don't want to pay for the product, you just want to take it home and try it.
[01:05:10.712 --> 01:05:14.476]  And if and only if you stop smoking, will you then come back and pay for it?
[01:05:14.476 --> 01:05:16.498]  Most likely, if you try this, you'd be arrested.
[01:05:16.498 --> 01:05:20.163]  But as silly as this sounds, this is exactly what the smoke-free free trial offer is.
[01:05:20.783 --> 01:05:27.853]  Smoke Free is a complete all natural stop smoking system and when you call today they'll send you a 30 day supply of the program absolutely free.
[01:05:27.853 --> 01:05:35.884]  This program eliminates withdrawals and cravings and includes a 30 day supply of the Smoke Free Capsules, a guide to living smoke free book, and audio support program.
[01:05:36.385 --> 01:05:37.546]  In the New World Order's war against humanity,
[01:06:04.409 --> 01:06:07.031]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:06:07.031 --> 01:06:14.055]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[01:06:14.620 --> 01:06:21.205]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:06:21.205 --> 01:06:23.167]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:06:23.167 --> 01:06:25.669]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:06:25.669 --> 01:06:36.637]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[01:06:37.250 --> 01:06:38.911]  It's not about left or right.
[01:06:38.911 --> 01:06:40.772]  It's about a one world government.
[01:06:40.772 --> 01:06:47.676]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[01:06:47.676 --> 01:06:55.940]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:06:55.940 --> 01:06:57.521]  The Obama Deception.
[01:06:57.521 --> 01:06:58.722]  The people strike back.
[01:07:00.615 --> 01:07:02.317]  Alex Jones here with a question.
[01:07:02.317 --> 01:07:04.059]  What does humidity mean to you?
[01:07:04.059 --> 01:07:06.742]  Most people think of hot and sticky summer days.
[01:07:06.742 --> 01:07:11.888]  But many people are beginning to realize that humidity can be a valuable source of pure drinking water.
[01:07:11.888 --> 01:07:15.071]  That's why I'd like you to visit acolablue.com.
[01:07:15.071 --> 01:07:18.575]  Acolablue is a state-of-the-art atmospheric water generator.
[01:07:18.982 --> 01:07:31.527]  Producing purified drinking water from the humidity in the air using reverse osmosis and a five-stage carbon and UV light filtration system which produces great tasting water at an unbeatable price.
[01:07:31.527 --> 01:07:33.528]  Finally, drinking water that you control.
[01:07:33.528 --> 01:07:35.249]  I use one every day.
[01:07:35.249 --> 01:07:37.710]  Say goodbye to expensive water delivery services.
[01:07:37.910 --> 01:07:38.691]  We're good to go.
[01:08:02.435 --> 01:08:09.061]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:08:09.061 --> 01:08:19.570]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:19.570 --> 01:08:20.831]  Alright, boiling it all down.
[01:08:23.296 --> 01:08:32.176]  As millions and millions of Americans, now more than 6 million total, that's a conservative number, have been out of work for months and months, some cases years.
[01:08:34.341 --> 01:08:37.083]  And there are waiting lines to get jobs at McDonald's.
[01:08:37.083 --> 01:08:40.745]  There are waiting lines to get jobs as pizza delivery people.
[01:08:40.745 --> 01:08:45.489]  There are lines to get jobs to clean out dog poop at the local vets.
[01:08:45.489 --> 01:08:48.711]  You know, there are lines everywhere to get basic jobs.
[01:08:48.711 --> 01:08:53.614]  And you've got people with college degrees who are married, have two or three children.
[01:08:53.614 --> 01:08:56.076]  They can't pay for their house, their cars.
[01:08:56.076 --> 01:08:59.778]  They can't even live at a subsistence level.
[01:08:59.778 --> 01:09:03.561]  They can't even survive on five, six, seven, eight dollars an hour.
[01:09:04.582 --> 01:09:20.320]  Meanwhile, hundreds of new taxes are being raised, the public's being squeezed, there's police out running checkpoints everywhere, riding people tickets for the most petty of reasons, illegal aliens are above the law, and the public is getting madder and madder and madder.
[01:09:21.758 --> 01:09:26.981]  And you've got over a hundred million gun owners out of three hundred million people in this country.
[01:09:26.981 --> 01:09:29.443]  You've got over a hundred million gun owners.
[01:09:29.443 --> 01:09:33.005]  Many of them are committed to defend the Second Amendment to the death.
[01:09:33.005 --> 01:09:41.310]  If one percent of a hundred million gun owners decides to fight to the death, that is one million people.
[01:09:41.310 --> 01:09:44.172]  One million guerrilla fighters.
[01:09:44.172 --> 01:09:47.774]  There is no force on earth that can stop that door-to-door.
[01:09:47.774 --> 01:09:49.535]  There is nothing the establishment can do.
[01:09:51.496 --> 01:09:55.197]  But you see, the establishment doesn't care about killing police and military.
[01:09:55.197 --> 01:09:57.097]  They don't care about societies falling apart.
[01:09:57.097 --> 01:10:17.681]  The IMF and World Bank documents that were leaked in December of 2001, that we publicized here, talk about how they make societies break down with their economic policies, then people start rioting, police and military start getting killed, then everything collapses, and then after six months to a year, the public rolls over to whatever the bankers wanted to do previously.
[01:10:18.840 --> 01:10:32.446]  Because, you know, after six months of being homeless or starving to death, and, you know, having battles with the police and military in which thousands died, then the people tend to come broke back to the government.
[01:10:32.446 --> 01:10:34.306]  And so they want to have a conflict.
[01:10:34.306 --> 01:10:37.288]  They want to have huge shootouts with the police and military.
[01:10:37.288 --> 01:10:40.329]  The social engineers want the breakdown of society.
[01:10:40.329 --> 01:10:42.630]  They want there to be a war between the people.
[01:10:46.021 --> 01:10:46.901]  This is their goal.
[01:10:46.901 --> 01:10:48.162]  This is what they're pushing for.
[01:10:48.162 --> 01:10:53.683]  This is what they want.
[01:10:53.683 --> 01:10:58.265]  This is how they operate.
[01:10:58.265 --> 01:11:00.085]  And that's how they break down a society.
[01:11:00.085 --> 01:11:00.965]  That's what Hitler did.
[01:11:00.965 --> 01:11:01.886]  That's what Stalin did.
[01:11:01.886 --> 01:11:06.307]  They create special cadres that work for the government.
[01:11:14.690 --> 01:11:19.017]  They create special cadres that feel like there's an us-against-them mentality.
[01:11:19.017 --> 01:11:23.143]  They tell them they're special, they're elite, they're defending the state, they're holding up society.
[01:11:23.143 --> 01:11:26.709]  And then they march the two groups against each other.
[01:11:32.802 --> 01:11:39.186]  And then the ensuing crisis that is created, then the establishment comes in and goes, oh my God, look at what's happened.
[01:11:39.186 --> 01:11:41.347]  See, we can't allow a Second Amendment.
[01:11:41.347 --> 01:11:45.090]  Oh, see, we can't allow free speech because look what it did to society.
[01:11:45.090 --> 01:11:47.791]  Then there won't be a discussion about arresting the bankers.
[01:11:47.791 --> 01:11:51.534]  There won't be a discussion about bringing them to justice.
[01:11:51.534 --> 01:11:53.375]  Because the country will be in civil war.
[01:11:55.353 --> 01:11:56.874]  Now, all of this could be bypassed.
[01:11:56.874 --> 01:11:58.274]  It's not too late.
[01:11:58.274 --> 01:12:05.917]  And, you know, this weekend I saw Bill Moyers coming out with experts admitting the bankers engineered this and are robbing everybody by design.
[01:12:05.917 --> 01:12:09.978]  I saw other television programs starting to talk about it, even mainstream.
[01:12:09.978 --> 01:12:14.460]  I heard neighbors talking about how it was engineered and how the bankers should be arrested.
[01:12:14.460 --> 01:12:16.901]  They've all committed major crimes.
[01:12:16.901 --> 01:12:22.123]  If we go and indict with evidence, through the Constitution, through the grand juries,
[01:12:23.527 --> 01:12:30.908]  The Larry Summers and Alan Greenspan and Ben Bernanke and Tim Geithner and all of these criminals.
[01:12:30.908 --> 01:12:35.269]  We can take our government back, federalize the Federal Reserve.
[01:12:35.269 --> 01:12:45.191]  It'll all come out how they had special slush funds and the comprehensive annual financial reports and how they robbed the country blind and how they were planning to implode the economy to set up world government.
[01:12:45.191 --> 01:12:46.511]  That's now all admitted.
[01:12:46.511 --> 01:12:48.792]  They're openly announcing world government be run by the banks.
[01:12:50.214 --> 01:13:08.223]  Either we remove the criminal elite that's in power through due process, through the system, or the elite is just going to get more power on top of more power out of the crises that they have created.
[01:13:08.223 --> 01:13:08.944]  And that's the choice.
[01:13:11.704 --> 01:13:12.425]  That's the choice.
[01:13:12.425 --> 01:13:24.134]  Either we let them cause the implosion of society, massive crime increasing, looting, rioting, citizens being killed, police being killed, military being killed, as they play us all off against each other.
[01:13:24.134 --> 01:13:27.897]  Race riots in the Southwest, burning cities.
[01:13:27.897 --> 01:13:29.598]  It's all coming.
[01:13:29.598 --> 01:13:33.341]  You can bet your bottom dollar on that and the government admits it's all coming.
[01:13:36.574 --> 01:13:53.953]  Or the American people come together and arrest the criminal elite, and then it's still going to be hard to fix things, but if we come together and do that, that will be seen as a reconciliation between the police, the military, the citizens, the general public, the different races, the different groups, and we can reverse what's happened here.
[01:13:53.953 --> 01:13:55.274]  We can arrest Hitler.
[01:13:55.274 --> 01:13:56.615]  We can arrest his ministers.
[01:13:57.296 --> 01:13:58.157]  And who is Hitler?
[01:13:58.157 --> 01:14:07.668]  It's the Council on Foreign Relations, it's the Trilateral Commission, it's the Rockefellers, it's the big foundations, it's the Frank Church Committee that exposed them all back in the seventies.
[01:14:07.668 --> 01:14:10.552]  This is the corporate globalist crime syndicate.
[01:14:10.552 --> 01:14:14.136]  Either you arrest the mafia, now in control of both branches,
[01:14:15.117 --> 01:14:19.498]  Of the political parties and all three branches of government, or it's only going to get worse.
[01:14:19.498 --> 01:14:22.019]  These people engineered the Soviet takeover.
[01:14:22.019 --> 01:14:23.799]  They engineered the Nazi takeover.
[01:14:23.799 --> 01:14:25.780]  They engineered the Maoist takeover.
[01:14:25.780 --> 01:14:28.741]  They do this to consolidate control.
[01:14:28.741 --> 01:14:35.322]  They're launching a revolution of economic collapse and then military control over you right now.
[01:14:35.322 --> 01:14:40.784]  We're going into a time of just unbelievable havoc and danger right now.
[01:14:42.389 --> 01:14:49.535]  And mark my words, ladies and gentlemen, there are going to be a lot more police and military killed.
[01:14:49.535 --> 01:14:58.623]  By the time this is over, it's going to number in the tens of thousands of dead police and military patrolling the streets of America.
[01:14:58.623 --> 01:15:09.853]  And that is a travesty, because not only are these men and women have children and families, most of them are just brainwashed, compartmentalized, they don't understand what they're part of, a lot of them are awake,
[01:15:11.354 --> 01:15:36.189]  Only a small percentage are control freak bullies, and out of the controlled conflict that's coming, the establishment will use that as an excuse to bring in real tyranny against the American people in the next phase after that, and they are playing the police, military, and citizens off against each other, when we should all be together against the offshore bankers that are engineering all of this.
[01:15:36.189 --> 01:15:37.250]  So I will tell citizens,
[01:15:38.300 --> 01:15:43.825]  Avoid conflict with the police and military at all costs.
[01:15:43.825 --> 01:15:45.446]  Certainly don't go to the FEMA camps.
[01:15:45.446 --> 01:15:46.787]  Certainly don't turn your guns in.
[01:15:46.787 --> 01:15:50.651]  You know, they're committing crimes when they try to do that.
[01:15:50.651 --> 01:15:59.899]  But, is this some new 1776 to have some 22-year-old guy having a fight with his mommy?
[01:15:59.899 --> 01:16:02.681]  Kill some cops in a domestic dispute?
[01:16:02.681 --> 01:16:02.721]  No.
[01:16:04.554 --> 01:16:07.456]  The media is trying to make the Patriot Movement own this.
[01:16:07.456 --> 01:16:08.577]  They're trying to make it ours.
[01:16:08.577 --> 01:16:09.797]  No, it's yours.
[01:16:09.797 --> 01:16:11.539]  You're the ones announcing martial law.
[01:16:11.539 --> 01:16:16.822]  You're the ones announcing North American Union and New World Order from Time Magazine to the Wall Street Journal.
[01:16:16.822 --> 01:16:23.306]  You're the ones trying to push gun bans through Congress and through the Supreme Court.
[01:16:23.306 --> 01:16:24.167]  You own this.
[01:16:24.167 --> 01:16:25.328]  This is yours.
[01:16:25.328 --> 01:16:30.491]  You turn the police against the people, or at least push that image.
[01:16:30.491 --> 01:16:32.893]  You created the us-against-them mentality.
[01:16:33.815 --> 01:16:36.977]  You committed all the crimes the New World Order has been involved in.
[01:16:36.977 --> 01:16:45.864]  The media, you defended the New World Order and told people it didn't exist and now you say it exists while at the same time saying it doesn't exist.
[01:16:45.864 --> 01:16:47.505]  You've lost all credibility.
[01:16:47.505 --> 01:16:52.108]  You own this and you own the conflict that's coming.
[01:16:52.108 --> 01:16:55.470]  I have every day said where this is leading.
[01:16:55.470 --> 01:16:57.772]  I have told you where this is leading.
[01:16:57.772 --> 01:16:58.773]  Dead citizens
[01:17:00.433 --> 01:17:12.422]  In blue uniforms and in plain clothes, because we're all citizens, piled up to the sun, while the New World Order sits offshore, rubbing their hands together, enjoying it.
[01:17:12.422 --> 01:17:19.667]  But I'll tell you what, Raw Story and others, you look ridiculous when you write stories saying Pittsburgh Shooter was a fan of online conspiracy theories.
[01:17:19.667 --> 01:17:23.830]  And then they go on to attack Glenn Beck.
[01:17:23.830 --> 01:17:25.511]  They said, uh, Edward
[01:17:28.444 --> 01:17:35.847]  Purvak told the Post-Gazette he was really into politics and really into the First and Second Amendment.
[01:17:35.847 --> 01:17:40.249]  He was apparently referring to so-called sovereign state movements, so now it's bad to have that happening.
[01:17:40.249 --> 01:17:50.154]  The Post-Gazette also mentions the conspiracy theory website PrisonPlanet.com run by radio talk show host Alex Jones as a source of some of Pawlowski's more off-the-wall notions.
[01:17:50.154 --> 01:17:52.195]  Last fall, the site ran the article, U.S.
[01:17:52.195 --> 01:17:54.476]  Troops and Homeland Crowd Control
[01:17:55.276 --> 01:17:58.538]  Patrols from October 1st, which claimed that U.S.
[01:17:58.538 --> 01:18:19.651]  troops returning from duty in Iraq will be carrying out homeland patrols in America from October 1st in complete violation of the Posse Comitatus Act for the purpose of helping with civil unrest and crowd control, which could include dealing with unruly Americans after a complete economic collapse.
[01:18:21.052 --> 01:18:40.640]  Now they go on to call me a nut and a bunch of other names in these articles, but the point is, that article, that link they give, is just a boil-down page we made at PrisonPlanet.com, The Washington Post, CNN, Army Times, where they announced for crowd control and for the breakdown of society after economic collapse.
[01:18:40.640 --> 01:18:44.222]  Those quotes are from The Washington Post and The Army Times.
[01:18:45.526 --> 01:18:59.054]  So see, I point at the Army Times and I get called a crazy conspiracy theorist off the wall and then get associated with some mad nut cop killer.
[01:18:59.054 --> 01:19:03.457]  The government building FEMA camps and announcing they're going to use troops against the American people
[01:19:04.694 --> 01:19:07.295]  is what's causing folks to get ready for war.
[01:19:07.295 --> 01:19:17.017]  And yes, you line up armies across a trench line from each other, you're going to start having people open fire without being given the order to.
[01:19:17.017 --> 01:19:18.038]  On both sides.
[01:19:18.038 --> 01:19:29.481]  You're going to have cops flipping out on citizens for no reason when they've got Ron Paul bumper stickers or Libertarian stickers, then the citizens are going to hate the police, then the police are going to hate the citizens more, and it's going to cause conflict!
[01:19:31.089 --> 01:19:33.071]  Because they are announcing new world order.
[01:19:33.071 --> 01:19:34.712]  They are announcing world government.
[01:19:34.712 --> 01:19:36.693]  They are announcing gun confiscation.
[01:19:36.693 --> 01:19:38.815]  They are announcing FEMA camps.
[01:19:38.815 --> 01:19:41.817]  And so you can't have it both ways.
[01:19:41.817 --> 01:19:51.184]  And then when we point at your mainstream news articles, and then blame us for what you're doing that is certainly contributing to all of this happening.
[01:19:51.184 --> 01:19:56.648]  Look, you start a war with the American people to get our guns, there's gonna be blood in the streets.
[01:19:56.648 --> 01:19:58.189]  And that's your fault.
[01:19:58.189 --> 01:19:58.750]  Your fault.
[01:20:01.761 --> 01:20:06.144]  The new World Order Beast is genetically modifying your food.
[01:20:06.144 --> 01:20:07.945]  Genetically modifying.
[01:20:07.945 --> 01:20:13.308]  Mixing vegetables with animals and now experimenting with viruses.
[01:20:13.308 --> 01:20:14.348]  Viruses.
[01:20:14.348 --> 01:20:20.092]  Without a long-term food solution, you will have just two options.
[01:20:20.092 --> 01:20:22.273]  Starve or surrender.
[01:20:22.273 --> 01:20:23.074]  Surrender.
[01:20:23.074 --> 01:20:26.856]  All canned food supplies will eventually run out.
[01:20:26.856 --> 01:20:27.756]  What then?
[01:20:30.456 --> 01:20:33.537]  Grow your own healthy food and feed your family forever.
[01:20:33.537 --> 01:20:37.879]  SurvivalistSeeds.com is now the nation's largest bulk heirloom seed company.
[01:20:37.879 --> 01:20:40.741]  And it's owned by a real patriot, Big John Lipscomb.

[01:21:01.423 --> 01:21:07.448]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:21:07.448 --> 01:21:12.712]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[01:21:13.337 --> 01:21:19.820]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:21:19.820 --> 01:21:21.800]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:21:21.800 --> 01:21:24.261]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[01:21:24.261 --> 01:21:37.447]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[01:21:37.447 --> 01:21:39.127]  It's not about left or right.
[01:21:39.127 --> 01:21:40.488]  It's about a one-world government.
[01:21:40.982 --> 01:21:47.887]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[01:21:56.153 --> 01:21:57.734]  The Obama Deception.
[01:21:57.734 --> 01:21:58.915]  The people strike back.
[01:22:01.067 --> 01:22:01.427]  Good day.
[01:22:01.427 --> 01:22:03.409]  I'm Jim Newcomer from Midas Resources.
[01:22:03.409 --> 01:22:04.910]  April 6, 2009.
[01:22:04.910 --> 01:22:06.771]  Gold opened this morning at $877.30.
[01:22:06.771 --> 01:22:11.034]  A one-ounce gold coin can be purchased for $903.01, $451.50 for a half ounce, and $225.75 for the quarter ounce.
[01:22:11.034 --> 01:22:11.675]  That's $903.01, $451.50, and $225.75.
[01:22:19.640 --> 01:22:33.267]  How is it that we the people grow the cotton, weave it into fabric, engrave the ink, embed the strips and fibers that protect it from counterfeit, then cart the money off to a privately owned bank to have it lent back to us at interest, forcing us to pay taxes to service the debt?
[01:22:33.267 --> 01:22:41.831]  Is this capitalism, or was Jefferson correct when he said, a central bank issuing a public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[01:22:42.091 --> 01:22:43.171]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[01:22:43.171 --> 01:22:47.533]  I'm placing a silver dollar inside of a book that explains how the monetary system works.
[01:22:47.533 --> 01:22:48.633]  Call for your copy 1-800-686-2237.
[01:22:48.633 --> 01:22:49.893]  Isn't it time to understand the system?
[01:22:49.893 --> 01:22:50.294]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:22:50.294 --> 01:22:50.794]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:22:50.794 --> 01:22:52.234]  Let's go to the heart of the matter.
[01:22:52.234 --> 01:22:56.255]  LifeChangeT has had some commercials that are not appealing to those who live in denial.
[01:23:11.383 --> 01:23:14.924]  Maybe we are to believe there are no parasites in the world.
[01:23:14.924 --> 01:23:17.606]  And that having a clogged colon is good for you.
[01:23:17.606 --> 01:23:20.267]  That being overweight is absolutely healthy.
[01:23:20.267 --> 01:23:23.228]  That there are no unhealthy chemicals in the air.
[01:23:23.228 --> 01:23:26.909]  And last but not least, fluoride in your water is good for you.
[01:23:26.909 --> 01:23:26.969]  Not?
[01:23:28.812 --> 01:23:33.594]  Get the T. Change your body and life from unhealthy to healthy.

[01:24:10.127 --> 01:24:31.688]  Okay, for the next hour and thirty minutes, I am going to cover the reality of FEMA camps in the United States, how it's controlled by the National Security Council,
[01:24:33.339 --> 01:24:35.740]  Who in turn controls FEMA.
[01:24:35.740 --> 01:24:49.385]  Presidential Decision Directive 51 is in place basically declaring the American people slaves to the federal government and saying that Congress and the courts are ceremonial under the president.
[01:24:49.385 --> 01:24:55.287]  So they've used continuity of government as a way to basically set up a dictatorship here in the United States.
[01:24:55.287 --> 01:24:58.689]  Now, I have made three police state films.
[01:25:00.229 --> 01:25:06.333]  I have also written books and news articles on the subject.
[01:25:06.333 --> 01:25:11.537]  And the problem is, when you cover FEMA camps, is there's so much evidence.
[01:25:11.537 --> 01:25:17.521]  So many congressional hearings, so many news articles, so many documents.
[01:25:17.521 --> 01:25:19.343]  The problem is knowing where to start.
[01:25:19.343 --> 01:25:29.370]  But I will start this presentation right now by simply going over the fact that Glenn Beck
[01:25:31.075 --> 01:25:38.620]  A year and a half ago said that Ron Paul supporters should be arrested and that the army should be used against them, that they were dangerous terrorists.
[01:25:38.620 --> 01:25:50.507]  And I've said, hey, I've read a lot of federal documents and a lot of police training manuals in the past, and what Glenn Beck is saying is a talking point being given out to the media.
[01:25:50.507 --> 01:26:00.133]  Because we were seeing Bill O'Reilly and Sean Hannity say it, we were seeing CNN hosts say it, we were seeing Joe Scarborough say it, and I said, that's a talking point.
[01:26:01.618 --> 01:26:05.499]  And then suddenly he started saying a few months ago, I'm going to expose the FEMA camps.
[01:26:05.499 --> 01:26:08.120]  I'm going to, I think they're real.
[01:26:08.120 --> 01:26:15.502]  And I said, well look out folks, he's just trying to get your confidence to then discredit it later.
[01:26:15.502 --> 01:26:19.563]  And that is indeed what Glenn Beck then did.
[01:26:19.563 --> 01:26:26.725]  He announced a few weeks ago, I'm going to have Popular Mechanics, the yellow journalist, on to debunk all of this.
[01:26:28.001 --> 01:26:35.603]  And then you literally have Michael Chertoff's cousin, you know, running the division of the magazine that puts out these reports.
[01:26:35.603 --> 01:26:38.764]  You have this high-level CIA operative's wife running it.
[01:26:38.764 --> 01:26:51.568]  You've got, you know, the 9-11 Commission officially saying that that's, you know, sourcing popular mechanics as their source, when the whole thing is full of mistakes and misinformation, just on the 9-11 front.
[01:26:51.568 --> 01:26:52.929]  But on this subject of
[01:26:54.298 --> 01:27:04.141]  Popper Mechanics saying that they are going to debunk FEMA camps.
[01:27:04.141 --> 01:27:08.603]  They've really stepped in it because the FEMA camps are on record in triplicate.
[01:27:11.257 --> 01:27:22.926]  Now, I did some research this weekend just to pull up past documents, articles, things I had read in the past, and therein lies the problem, trying to even cover it all.
[01:27:22.926 --> 01:27:36.016]  Here is the Civilian Inmate Labor Camp Program Army Regulation 210-35, and we're simulcasting the radio show at PrisonPlanet.tv, so we'll put that up on screen for folks that are watching.
[01:27:37.048 --> 01:27:39.649]  Civilian Inmate Labor Camp Program.
[01:27:39.649 --> 01:27:42.471]  We're going to be going over that for folks.
[01:27:42.471 --> 01:27:51.056]  We're going to go over the official government documents and news articles about FEMA camps from Mainstream News.
[01:27:51.056 --> 01:27:53.317]  I have that folder.
[01:27:53.317 --> 01:27:55.938]  And things that tie into the FEMA camps.
[01:27:55.938 --> 01:28:02.702]  Mainstream mass grave news articles and internal government documents about mass graves for the American people.
[01:28:02.702 --> 01:28:04.643]  The rumors end, the documentation begins.
[01:28:06.018 --> 01:28:15.932]  I thought I'd go over the executive orders for martial law and document those public pieces of material for you to go check out for anybody who's questioning.
[01:28:15.932 --> 01:28:20.178]  The public being prepared for martial law and the FEMA camps.
[01:28:21.585 --> 01:28:26.466]  And troops on the streets, you know, that ties into martial law in FEMA camps.
[01:28:26.466 --> 01:28:33.648]  And a bunch of different videos where Congress and others are being threatened with martial law.
[01:28:33.648 --> 01:28:41.449]  And this is only, again, a small amount of the material we're going to go over in this presentation.
[01:28:41.449 --> 01:28:50.311]  I would ask listeners to check out every claim we're going to make for yourself, because the biggest problem we do have going for us
[01:28:52.014 --> 01:29:17.747]  is that most of the stuff I see on the internet is speculation or rumors or they'll go show a closed Amtrak station and they'll say this is a FEMA camp and they'll show the ticketing area where it'll have red signs for these tickets and blue signs for those ticket holders and it's not a FEMA camp and when Glenn Beck does his debunking, he says he's going to do tonight
[01:29:18.738 --> 01:29:23.261]  I have predicted that he will go with the straw man argument.
[01:29:23.261 --> 01:29:33.027]  He will show where people have been looking for FEMA camps and been incorrect instead of all of this material that he won't touch.
[01:29:33.027 --> 01:29:38.811]  Now I'm told he went ahead and covered it on his radio show today and did quote debunk things and it's on TV tonight as well.
[01:29:39.571 --> 01:29:45.553]  We're gonna go ahead and go through all this, and then you can go back and see his debunking, and see if our predictions were right.
[01:29:45.553 --> 01:29:47.594]  The predictions I've made for the last few weeks.
[01:29:47.594 --> 01:29:48.094]  Stay with us.
[01:29:48.094 --> 01:29:51.115]  We'll go through it all when we get back.
[01:29:51.115 --> 01:29:52.516]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.516 --> 01:29:55.057]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:55.057 --> 01:30:01.459]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:01.459 --> 01:30:02.360]  You worry.
[01:30:02.360 --> 01:30:04.440]  You see the signs and worry about the future.
[01:30:04.440 --> 01:30:07.081]  You worry about economic turmoil and food shortages.
[01:30:07.081 --> 01:30:08.842]  How to be prepared while preserving your sanity.
[01:30:09.189 --> 01:30:10.810]  Your answer may be at hand.
[01:30:10.810 --> 01:30:14.391]  Author Linda Runyon lived off the land, isolated from civilization.
[01:30:14.391 --> 01:30:19.633]  She knows that as long as the sun shines, there will be plenty of free food all over God's green earth.
[01:30:19.633 --> 01:30:23.594]  Perhaps the only sane insurance is knowledge of wild edible plants.
[01:30:23.594 --> 01:30:25.295]  The cost of learning is minimal.
[01:30:25.295 --> 01:30:28.196]  Wild food grows everywhere and you will see it everywhere.
[01:30:28.196 --> 01:30:31.137]  It's every bit organic and more nutritious than our modern diets.
[01:30:31.636 --> 01:30:40.283]  Well respected in her field, Linda's approach to teaching this subject includes books, flashcards, and video with an emphasis on health, safety, practicality, and joy.
[01:30:40.283 --> 01:30:45.107]  Learn how to identify it, where and when to find it, how to prepare, use, and store it.
[01:30:45.107 --> 01:30:49.131]  Go to Linda's website, ofthefield.com, and take advantage of special offers.
[01:30:49.131 --> 01:30:53.154]  Or if you're not online, call her 24-hour, toll-free order line at 888-51-EAT-FREE.
[01:30:53.154 --> 01:30:54.535]  That number again, 888-51-EAT-FREE.
[01:30:54.535 --> 01:30:56.256]  A little knowledge makes starvation impossible.
[01:31:01.565 --> 01:31:07.389]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:31:07.389 --> 01:31:14.373]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[01:31:14.958 --> 01:31:21.540]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:31:21.540 --> 01:31:23.520]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:31:23.520 --> 01:31:26.021]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:31:26.021 --> 01:31:37.584]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[01:31:37.584 --> 01:31:39.265]  It's not about left or right.
[01:31:39.265 --> 01:31:40.585]  It's about a one-world government.
[01:31:41.118 --> 01:31:48.023]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[01:31:48.023 --> 01:31:56.289]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:31:56.289 --> 01:31:57.870]  The Obama Deception.
[01:31:57.870 --> 01:31:59.051]  The people strike back.
[01:32:00.999 --> 01:32:08.205]  You already know that drinking pure high alkaline pH water is the most important factor in maintaining high energy and vibrant health.
[01:32:08.205 --> 01:32:12.769]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 8 or higher.
[01:32:12.769 --> 01:32:18.374]  AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline ingredients.
[01:32:18.374 --> 01:32:25.440]  Using Plasma pH Drops is one of the best ways to make your water alkaline, to help you get rid of acid and regain your health and energy.
[01:32:25.900 --> 01:32:31.282]  Simply put, 10 drops per liter of water you drink to raise the pH to the ultimate level.
[01:32:31.282 --> 01:32:37.143]  Alkalizing water helps your body rid itself of acidic waste and increases the oxygen content of your body.
[01:32:37.143 --> 01:32:42.585]  Disease organisms like bacteria and cancer cannot survive in an alkaline, high pH environment.

[01:32:52.830 --> 01:32:56.311]  While you were sleeping They came and took it all away
[01:33:19.305 --> 01:33:22.661]  The place is where you used to play.
[01:33:27.162 --> 01:33:28.802]  Okay.
[01:33:28.802 --> 01:33:33.804]  About three weeks ago, when Glenn Beck was saying, I want to know if the FEMA camps are real.
[01:33:33.804 --> 01:33:34.824]  I'm doing research.
[01:33:34.824 --> 01:33:36.505]  I don't know if they're real.
[01:33:36.505 --> 01:33:37.325]  We said, okay.
[01:33:37.325 --> 01:33:50.170]  We did an hour-long simulcast from the radio show on the web at PrisonPlanet.TV, and I showed congressional hearings, Miami Herald articles admitting shadow government FEMA camps for martial law.
[01:33:51.050 --> 01:33:58.934]  We showed the bills for martial law, the John Warner Defense Authorization Act, PDD 51, and we put together that video.
[01:33:58.934 --> 01:34:00.454]  It went viral on YouTube.
[01:34:00.454 --> 01:34:02.115]  We emailed it to Glenn Beck.
[01:34:02.115 --> 01:34:03.616]  We mailed letters to Glenn Beck.
[01:34:03.616 --> 01:34:05.356]  I know people that work in his office.
[01:34:05.356 --> 01:34:07.797]  I contacted him and I said, here's the proof.
[01:34:07.797 --> 01:34:11.419]  If he wants it, we stand by to work with Mr. Beck.
[01:34:11.419 --> 01:34:15.441]  If he isn't going to come out next week and say arrest all of us, basically like he was doing a year ago.
[01:34:16.761 --> 01:34:28.944]  And sure enough, Glenn Beck comes out and says, the FEMA camps aren't real, there's a kernel of truth in the FEMA camps, but when we hear there's this massive plan to take over, it's not true.
[01:34:28.944 --> 01:34:38.786]  And he says, I'm going to have, coming up in a few weeks, which is today, on Fox Television, I'm going to have Popular Mechanics on to debunk all of this.
[01:34:40.765 --> 01:34:51.316]  Well, from that, and we'll see if we're right tonight, I'm told he's doing his radio show right now and trying to debunk it, but we'll see if we were right, that he will build straw men.
[01:34:51.316 --> 01:34:52.637]  Now, why is this important?
[01:34:52.637 --> 01:34:59.163]  Fox News and the establishment have Glenn Beck come out, they try to get our confidence, and then they tell us that FEMA camps don't exist.
[01:34:59.989 --> 01:35:09.534]  When we know the FEMA camps exist and the government has stated how they plan to roll out the use of the FEMA camps against the American people.
[01:35:09.534 --> 01:35:15.197]  So let's go ahead and start with this now.
[01:35:15.197 --> 01:35:19.600]  Up on screen are photocopies
[01:35:22.427 --> 01:35:35.095]  of the Miami Herald, and this goes back into the 1980s, when they had congressional hearings dealing with shadow government and martial law.
[01:35:35.095 --> 01:35:49.984]  There's the headline, The Secret Government, and it talks about secret summits, a plan to take over the government, and it shows the people that were in charge of the Continental Government, Dick Cheney and others.
[01:35:49.984 --> 01:35:50.665]  And then we have a
[01:35:52.421 --> 01:36:12.349]  Congressional hearing where we have congressman Jack Brooks and others during our ran contra bringing up the secret plans and they're told by congressman in a way that that can't be discussed it's a national security issue so let's go ahead and play that clip that goes to Henry B Gonzalez
[01:36:13.756 --> 01:36:30.065]  Colonel North, in your work at the NSC, will you not decide at one time to work on plans for the continuity of government in the event of a major disaster?
[01:36:30.065 --> 01:36:41.572]  Mr. Chairman, I believe the question touches upon a highly sensitive and classified area, so may I request that
[01:36:43.223 --> 01:36:46.164]  You do not touch upon that, sir.
[01:36:46.164 --> 01:37:07.630]  I was particularly concerned, Mr. Chairman, because I read in Miami Papers and several others that there had been a plan developed by that same agency, a contingency plan in the event of an emergency that would suspend the American Constitution.
[01:37:07.630 --> 01:37:12.211]  And I was deeply concerned about it and wondered if that was the area in which he had worked.
[01:37:14.285 --> 01:37:21.009]  May I most respectfully request that that matter not be touched upon at this stage.
[01:37:21.009 --> 01:37:26.792]  If we wish to get into this on certain arrangements can be made for an executive session.
[01:37:26.792 --> 01:37:33.176]  And tragically the only member who got close was Jack Brooks and he was stopped by the chairman.
[01:37:33.176 --> 01:37:42.362]  But the truth of the matter is that yes you do have those standby provisions and the plans are there and the statutory emergency plans are there whereby
[01:37:43.503 --> 01:37:57.434]  You could, in the name of stopping terrorism, apprehend, invoke the military, and arrest Americans, and hold them in detention camps.
[01:37:57.434 --> 01:38:02.158]  In times of passion, and in times of great fear,
[01:38:03.803 --> 01:38:16.833]  What to the eyes of the person and the mind of a person in time of relative peace and stability seem impossible become very real, very logical, very possible.
[01:38:16.833 --> 01:38:18.094]  All right.
[01:38:18.094 --> 01:38:23.598]  Now that is from my film Police State to the Takeover made in late 1999.
[01:38:23.598 --> 01:38:28.202]  And I'm going over government sponsored terror, how they're going to stage terror attacks to bring in martial law.
[01:38:28.202 --> 01:38:30.604]  They would incrementally train us to accept troops on the streets.
[01:38:32.130 --> 01:38:33.611]  And we have a whole stack of news there.
[01:38:33.611 --> 01:38:43.796]  Just this weekend, just on Friday, Tennessee newspapers reported they were going to have regular army running checkpoints on the highways with the police.
[01:38:43.796 --> 01:38:46.258]  As Brigade Homeland has announced.
[01:38:46.258 --> 01:38:48.519]  As the Army Times, as Northcom has announced.
[01:38:49.309 --> 01:38:50.730]  Our listeners got upset.
[01:38:50.730 --> 01:38:54.271]  The governor was called, and we've got that coming up, and they suspended that.
[01:38:54.271 --> 01:38:58.273]  But still, we got photographs of other Marine Corps drills going on.
[01:38:58.273 --> 01:39:00.274]  So they're acclimating the public.
[01:39:00.274 --> 01:39:03.976]  You have car wrecks, the troops show up.
[01:39:03.976 --> 01:39:06.837]  You have drunk driving checkpoints, the Marines are there.
[01:39:06.837 --> 01:39:08.858]  Again, acclimating you.
[01:39:08.858 --> 01:39:11.239]  Star flight for people in car wrecks, the troops.
[01:39:11.239 --> 01:39:12.960]  Mass shooting in Alabama.
[01:39:12.960 --> 01:39:15.341]  Regular Army show up.
[01:39:15.341 --> 01:39:16.882]  This is part of the acclimation.
[01:39:19.272 --> 01:39:23.155]  Now, I could go through this all day.
[01:39:23.155 --> 01:39:24.696]  Again, there's so many pieces of evidence.
[01:39:24.696 --> 01:39:36.644]  Let's next go to modern times, then I'll go back into the executive orders and the bills and actual numbers you can check for yourselves.
[01:39:36.644 --> 01:39:39.707]  Let's go ahead and go to congressmen.
[01:39:40.999 --> 01:39:47.000]  A year and a half ago, on the Homeland Security Board, wanting to know about PDD 51.
[01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:49.901]  Now this fight went on for a year.
[01:39:49.901 --> 01:39:57.782]  The cover sheet of Presidential Decision Directive 51 stated the President's a dictator, Congress has no power during any emergency, including economic.
[01:39:57.782 --> 01:40:03.564]  So now Congress isn't involved in continual government when Congress is co-equal to the President and the courts.
[01:40:03.564 --> 01:40:09.725]  In fact, the Founding Fathers said Congress was above the courts and the President, but then later courts said, no, they're equal, now they're saying they're not.
[01:40:10.467 --> 01:40:12.129]  Okay?
[01:40:12.129 --> 01:40:16.612]  Because it's harder for a dictator to take control in the Congress because there's 500 people.
[01:40:16.612 --> 01:40:17.533]  Separation of powers.
[01:40:17.533 --> 01:40:21.277]  The President is where your main dictator will come from, so it's the weakest.
[01:40:21.277 --> 01:40:27.182]  It follows the orders of Congress and then executes those orders.
[01:40:27.182 --> 01:40:32.666]  But then the Chairman of the Homeland Security Committee said, I am co-equal with the President in national security.
[01:40:32.666 --> 01:40:33.587]  Let me see PDD 51.
[01:40:33.587 --> 01:40:34.288]  They were told, no.
[01:40:36.038 --> 01:40:40.200]  But the cover sheet alone states the President's a dictator.
[01:40:40.200 --> 01:40:53.965]  Then we see last year PDD 51 being executed and members of Congress, Senator Inhofe and others being told, martial law will be declared if you don't hand total control and immunity over to the banks.
[01:40:53.965 --> 01:40:55.625]  And they followed orders and did it.
[01:40:55.625 --> 01:40:57.966]  So the martial law is now in place.
[01:40:57.966 --> 01:41:00.267]  And with that comes the FEMA camps.
[01:41:00.267 --> 01:41:01.788]  Will we get to that place?
[01:41:01.788 --> 01:41:02.908]  Not if we expose it.
[01:41:02.908 --> 01:41:04.869]  But we're already got our neck in the noose here.
[01:41:05.629 --> 01:41:07.211]  Is the executioner going to pull the lever?
[01:41:07.211 --> 01:41:07.932]  I don't know.
[01:41:07.932 --> 01:41:11.476]  But it's not going to help having Glenn Beck denying all this is happening.
[01:41:11.476 --> 01:41:15.380]  Let's continue with the congressman talking about PDD 51.
[01:41:15.380 --> 01:41:19.265]  Most Americans would agree that it would be prudent
[01:41:20.464 --> 01:41:28.433]  To have a plan to provide for the continuity of government and the rule of law in case of a devastating terrorist attack or natural disaster.
[01:41:28.433 --> 01:41:35.261]  A plan to provide for the cooperation, the coordination, and continued functioning of all three branches of the government.
[01:41:35.261 --> 01:41:38.625]  The Bush administration tells us they have such a plan.
[01:41:39.105 --> 01:41:47.472]  They introduced a little sketchy public version that's clearly inadequate and doesn't really tell us what they have in mind.
[01:41:47.472 --> 01:41:50.514]  But they said, don't worry, there's a detailed classified version.
[01:41:51.098 --> 01:42:04.381]  But now they've denied the entire Homeland Security Committee of the United States House of Representatives access to their so-called detailed plan to provide for continuity of government.
[01:42:04.381 --> 01:42:05.762]  They say trust us.
[01:42:05.762 --> 01:42:06.862]  Trust us?
[01:42:06.862 --> 01:42:11.603]  The people who brought us Katrina to be competent in face of a disaster?
[01:42:11.603 --> 01:42:12.703]  Trust us?
[01:42:12.703 --> 01:42:19.285]  The people who brought us warrantless wiretapping and other excesses eroding our civil liberties?
[01:42:19.285 --> 01:42:19.945]  Trust us?
[01:42:21.007 --> 01:42:25.608]  Maybe the plan just really doesn't exist and that's why they won't show it to us.
[01:42:25.608 --> 01:42:26.528]  I don't know.
[01:42:26.528 --> 01:42:29.349]  Or maybe there's something there that's outrageous.
[01:42:29.349 --> 01:42:36.971]  The American people need their elected representatives to review this plan for the continuity of government.
[01:42:36.971 --> 01:42:38.191]  The gentleman's time has expired.
[01:42:38.191 --> 01:42:39.932]  For what purposes does the gentleman from Texas rise?
[01:42:39.932 --> 01:42:40.332]  All right.
[01:42:40.332 --> 01:42:42.813]  All right, that's Congressman Peter Defazio.
[01:42:42.813 --> 01:42:44.153]  Now, that was a year and a half ago.
[01:42:45.229 --> 01:42:51.651]  Mr. DeFazio, the cover sheet says the President's a dictator, and that Congress has no authority over continuity of government.
[01:42:51.651 --> 01:42:57.413]  That's why they're now saying Congress can't see it, because they're declaring and executing that power.
[01:42:57.413 --> 01:43:05.376]  That's why the Vice President's heard saying he was above Congress and above the Executive, and in his own area of government, declaring new imaginary powers.
[01:43:07.042 --> 01:43:15.092]  That's why the White House Chief of Staff and the top lawyers and Chief Counsel were writing the President was God and could order the torture of children in front of their parents.
[01:43:15.092 --> 01:43:18.977]  And this is the Fuhrer precept, or saying the leader is the law.
[01:43:20.262 --> 01:43:36.346]  Now, we fast forward a year plus, to October 3rd, and here is Congressman Sherman, who we interviewed here on air, other congressmen we interviewed, and Senator Inhofe, saying, they marched in and told them, martial law will be declared if you don't do this.
[01:43:36.346 --> 01:43:49.689]  So, we go from the 80s, to where, don't talk about the martial law plans in the FEMA camps, if you want to know about that, you can know about it in executive session, Congressman Jack Brooks, to, oh, Congress, you're not allowed to see the plans now.
[01:43:51.260 --> 01:43:56.002]  To Congress, do what we say, we're under martial law.
[01:43:56.002 --> 01:43:57.942]  Now, you want proof of martial law?
[01:43:57.942 --> 01:43:59.203]  Proof of FEMA camps?
[01:43:59.203 --> 01:43:59.783]  Here it is!
[01:43:59.783 --> 01:44:01.984]  Go ahead and play it!
[01:44:01.984 --> 01:44:08.366]  The only way they can pass this bill is by creating and sustaining a panic atmosphere.
[01:44:08.366 --> 01:44:11.647]  That atmosphere is not justified.
[01:44:11.647 --> 01:44:16.209]  Many of us were told in private conversations that if we voted against this bill,
[01:44:17.168 --> 01:44:31.463]  On Monday, that the sky would fall, the market would drop two or three thousand points the first day, another couple thousand the second day, and a few members were even told that there would be martial law in America if we voted no.
[01:44:32.679 --> 01:44:35.140]  That's what I call fear-mongering.
[01:44:35.140 --> 01:44:36.480]  Unjustified.
[01:44:36.480 --> 01:44:37.841]  Proven wrong.
[01:44:37.841 --> 01:44:41.602]  We've got a week, we've got two weeks to write a good bill.
[01:44:41.602 --> 01:44:46.324]  The only way to write, to pass a bad bill, keep the panic pressure on.
[01:44:46.324 --> 01:44:48.085]  Now what has the Senate done to this bill?
[01:44:49.405 --> 01:44:50.246]  Exactly.
[01:44:50.246 --> 01:44:58.610]  And now they've passed more bailouts, more stimulus packages, total federalization, federalization of health records, federalization of the internet.
[01:44:58.610 --> 01:45:00.450]  It's all happening.
[01:45:00.450 --> 01:45:04.452]  Mother Jones admits Obama is, quote, taking over the internet and preparing to shut it down.
[01:45:04.452 --> 01:45:06.613]  That's what the bill says.
[01:45:06.613 --> 01:45:08.394]  Even liberals are admitting this is happening.
[01:45:08.394 --> 01:45:10.675]  See, it was all about Bush was going to do this.
[01:45:10.675 --> 01:45:11.736]  No, Bush was a puppet.
[01:45:13.083 --> 01:45:20.676]  Just like Nixon and Carter and Reagan and Bush and Clinton and Bush and Obama.
[01:45:20.676 --> 01:45:25.584]  They're just puppets and we always obsess over them and the media acts like they're running something.
[01:45:26.471 --> 01:45:30.013]  It's the executive power held by the National Security Council.
[01:45:30.013 --> 01:45:43.042]  In fact, three weeks ago, they had an article about General James Jones and the National Security Council saying they've now taken over continutive government, even from the executive and Homeland Security, and that this private group runs it all.
[01:45:43.042 --> 01:45:54.330]  And then General Jones was in the CFR website saying, writing, I take all my orders from former national security heads, Henry Kissinger and the CFR.
[01:45:56.769 --> 01:46:13.812]  I mean, that's why in the last week there have been four mainstream news articles that we posted at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com with Bilderberg Group members like Etienne Davignon, the chairman of Bilderberg, saying, we set up the European Union, we set up the G20, we've set up the New World Order banking system.
[01:46:14.855 --> 01:46:18.699]  I mean, now they're openly bragging it's world government and they run it.
[01:46:18.699 --> 01:46:27.787]  And then if I dare talk about it and go, look, Etienne Davion told the EU Observer, you know, he told the newspaper this, they go, oh, shut up, Jones!
[01:46:27.787 --> 01:46:30.110]  You crazy nut, none of that exists.
[01:46:30.110 --> 01:46:32.532]  And if you talk about it, you're going to cause violence.
[01:46:32.532 --> 01:46:36.276]  Just give in to the New World Order, roll over to it, hand your guns in.
[01:46:40.834 --> 01:46:42.576]  And I get back to this thing about Glenn Beck.
[01:46:42.576 --> 01:46:50.405]  I mean, it's ridiculous to say that we're not going into tyranny when PDD 51 says the President is a dictator.
[01:46:50.405 --> 01:46:52.827]  Go read it for yourself.
[01:46:52.827 --> 01:46:58.073]  When the John Warner Defense Authorization Act says the Governor serve at the pleasure of the President.
[01:46:58.073 --> 01:47:01.276]  The Pentagon issued a directive six months ago
[01:47:02.037 --> 01:47:09.664]  Saying their job is now crowd control, and that the governors serve at the pleasure of the president, they're dual-headed officers, and they've issued 1404.10.
[01:47:09.664 --> 01:47:14.628]  In fact, I forgot to print that for this presentation.
[01:47:14.628 --> 01:47:17.210]  There's just so much racing through my mind I want to document.
[01:47:17.210 --> 01:47:25.678]  Google that story that we wrote about, Aaron knows about it, get him to print it, the one about Pentagon creates new civilian force.
[01:47:27.188 --> 01:47:36.677]  I think it's 1404.10, but I want to be exact on that with folks.
[01:47:36.677 --> 01:47:39.619]  And so we've got all of this here.
[01:47:39.619 --> 01:47:40.900]  Now, I've already covered...
[01:47:49.414 --> 01:47:50.954]  Let's go ahead and get to this.
[01:47:50.954 --> 01:47:56.716]  I mean, you want to see what goes with FEMA camps like a horse and carriage.
[01:47:56.716 --> 01:48:03.137]  Troops, militarized police, training with the Army to take over your cities and towns.
[01:48:03.137 --> 01:48:07.678]  Now, the Pentagon has now announced all of this, and we're going to get to that in a moment.
[01:48:07.678 --> 01:48:13.460]  But first, let's go ahead and play this YouTube clip, Martial Law is Coming, from News 7 at 11.
[01:48:15.603 --> 01:48:24.332]  Okay, let's go ahead and play this clip for folks, and we have hundreds of these around the country, as the police and military train to take over your towns and cities.
[01:48:24.332 --> 01:48:26.654]  Here it is.
[01:48:26.654 --> 01:48:33.121]  The scenario was a fake, but the pepper spray and billy clubs used to break up this riot were definitely real.
[01:48:34.335 --> 01:48:35.915]  Good evening, I'm Miranda Stevens.
[01:48:35.915 --> 01:48:42.437]  Whether it's terrorism, riots, or any major disaster, local agencies will be the first to respond.
[01:48:42.437 --> 01:48:47.498]  That's why Roanoke City wants its disaster training to be as real as possible.
[01:48:47.498 --> 01:48:53.020]  Jeremy Butterfield has more.
[01:48:53.020 --> 01:48:59.441]  It's supposed to look like a riot, and the scene at William Fleming High School had all the elements.
[01:48:59.441 --> 01:49:03.342]  One of the rioters that the guard and the police force had to take down and arrest
[01:49:04.056 --> 01:49:06.698]  And did very successfully.
[01:49:06.698 --> 01:49:09.620]  In this scenario, everyone has a role to play.
[01:49:09.620 --> 01:49:23.010]  The rioters were ready to fight back as Roanoke Police, Roanoke Fire, local National Guard troops, and members of the Virginia Defense Force secured perimeters and moved in to make the arrests.
[01:49:23.010 --> 01:49:28.173]  Prior to 9-11, these organizations couldn't communicate and did not work together.
[01:49:28.173 --> 01:49:30.515]  They worked to support each other, but not together.
[01:49:31.149 --> 01:49:38.403]  And with the recent events of the last three to five years, we've become very good at working together, which is very important.
[01:49:39.454 --> 01:49:41.816]  Of course, these weren't real rioters.
[01:49:41.816 --> 01:49:48.782]  The rebels in t-shirts were all members of one of the participating agencies, but you couldn't tell that during the exercise.
[01:49:48.782 --> 01:50:00.411]  If you weren't protected by an orange vest signifying you as an observer, you were in danger of being hit by eggs, bottles, billy clubs, or even the occasional well-placed round from a sniper.
[01:50:00.411 --> 01:50:03.834]  We try to make this very real, give a real feel to it.
[01:50:03.834 --> 01:50:09.178]  The fire department provided some live burning out here, so we had smoke, flames,
[01:50:09.685 --> 01:50:11.786]  Objects being thrown, a lot of chaos.
[01:50:11.786 --> 01:50:17.787]  There's going to be a lot of chaos in a civil disturbance situation, and that's what we want to try to incorporate as much as possible.
[01:50:17.787 --> 01:50:19.748]  Teamwork plays a major role.
[01:50:19.748 --> 01:50:26.830]  Mountain Police had to coordinate with the Fire Department, while National Guard troops marched in formation toward the rioters.
[01:50:26.830 --> 01:50:32.851]  Without cooperation throughout all the agencies, the rioters would have quickly taken control.
[01:50:32.851 --> 01:50:34.852]  I think everybody learned a little bit.
[01:50:34.852 --> 01:50:38.893]  Mistakes are made, but we'd rather make those mistakes here than in a real situation.
[01:50:39.875 --> 01:50:47.085]  This was the fourth year the agencies have participated in this drill and organizers say the old adage... Alright, pause it there.
[01:50:47.085 --> 01:50:49.809]  We're going to come back and finish up the end of that report.
[01:50:49.809 --> 01:50:51.351]  And we've got a ton more coming up.
[01:50:51.351 --> 01:50:56.138]  A whole other hour and five minutes as I break down the reality of the FEMA camps.
[01:50:56.138 --> 01:50:56.658]  Stay with us.
[01:51:01.312 --> 01:51:08.158]  Did you know that the new energy czar wants to control how much power your electrical company allows you to have?
[01:51:08.158 --> 01:51:09.099]  It's true.
[01:51:09.099 --> 01:51:14.684]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:51:14.684 --> 01:51:16.045]  Not if, but when.
[01:51:18.749 --> 01:51:22.233]  How about you folks know that I got my solar backup generator hooked up and running.
[01:51:22.233 --> 01:51:24.035]  To tell you the truth, it's awesome!
[01:51:24.035 --> 01:51:30.041]  Not only was it easy to install, but it's powering my fridge, lights, TV and shortwave radio.
[01:51:30.041 --> 01:51:32.884]  I now know that I'm one step closer to getting off the grid.
[01:51:32.884 --> 01:51:33.685]  Thanks for all your help!
[01:51:34.045 --> 01:51:41.490]  This generator is solar powered, complete with battery backup, has no moving parts to wear out or break, and requires no gas.
[01:51:41.490 --> 01:51:45.472]  Don't wait for the Energy Czar to cut your power or raise your rates.
[01:51:45.472 --> 01:51:47.913]  Produce your own electricity for free.
[01:51:47.913 --> 01:51:50.175]  Go to MySolarBackup.com.
[01:51:50.175 --> 01:51:52.756]  That's MySolarBackup.com.
[01:51:52.756 --> 01:51:53.257]  Or call 877-327-0365.
[01:51:53.257 --> 01:51:53.297]  877-327-0365.
[01:52:01.494 --> 01:52:06.720]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:52:07.526 --> 01:52:13.408]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[01:52:13.408 --> 01:52:19.890]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:52:19.890 --> 01:52:21.871]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:52:21.871 --> 01:52:24.332]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:52:24.332 --> 01:52:35.216]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[01:52:37.521 --> 01:52:39.182]  It's not about left or right.
[01:52:39.182 --> 01:52:41.042]  It's about a one-world government.
[01:52:41.042 --> 01:52:47.965]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[01:52:47.965 --> 01:52:56.208]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:52:56.208 --> 01:52:57.788]  The Obama Deception.
[01:52:57.788 --> 01:52:58.989]  The people strike back.
[01:53:01.311 --> 01:53:03.172]  Are you embarrassed by your legs?
[01:53:03.172 --> 01:53:05.154]  Are your legs sore and irritated?
[01:53:05.154 --> 01:53:08.596]  Millions of women suffer from leg pain due to varicose veins.
[01:53:08.596 --> 01:53:13.559]  When varicose veins prevent you from living and enjoying your everyday life, you need Venulox.
[01:53:13.559 --> 01:53:19.063]  Venulox is a dietary tool formulated to restore naturally beautiful legs from the inside out.

[01:53:41.294 --> 01:53:43.995]  And remember, when you call 1-888-4FITLEG, ask how to get your VaniLuxe free.
[01:53:43.995 --> 01:53:44.895]  That's 1-888-4FITLEG.
[01:53:55.439 --> 01:53:56.800]  By the way, later in the show...
[01:54:06.408 --> 01:54:18.390]  I was going to play a state rep out of Tennessee who found out about regular army checkpoints searching American citizens, called the governor's office, heard about it from this radio show, and stopped it.
[01:54:18.390 --> 01:54:20.071]  And he talked to the governor.
[01:54:20.071 --> 01:54:25.011]  So we'll talk to the state rep who talked to the governor and got this stopped over the weekend.
[01:54:25.011 --> 01:54:33.053]  Coming up, instead of just playing him on the local news, we can have the state rep for you who narrowly stopped regular army running checkpoints in Tennessee.
[01:54:34.963 --> 01:54:52.928]  And then, see, you talk about this and Mainstream writes articles about me like I'm crazy, making up troops and troop deployments when it's the Army Times, the Army War College, hundreds of newspapers have announced it, and then I say, hey, that's tyranny, and they go, shut up, Jones doesn't exist!
[01:54:52.928 --> 01:55:00.230]  Now, I've got all these video clips I'm trying to get done with now, and then I'll get into all the articles about FEMA camps, bill numbers, executive orders, all of it for you.
[01:55:00.230 --> 01:55:03.311]  We're going to be covering it.
[01:55:03.311 --> 01:55:03.491]  But,
[01:55:04.841 --> 01:55:15.023]  Let's go ahead and finish up with this one case, and this is everywhere, of the police training with the military, the National Guard now federalized, for civil disturbances.
[01:55:15.023 --> 01:55:20.365]  And then I have video clips of them taking people to a FEMA camp in Seattle during the 99 thing.
[01:55:20.365 --> 01:55:24.206]  This is the continuity of government situation.
[01:55:24.206 --> 01:55:26.266]  And how is Glenn Beck debunking it?
[01:55:26.266 --> 01:55:33.908]  I have predicted tonight, we'll see if I'm right, that he will do a straw man and focus on the websites that are getting it wrong.
[01:55:34.690 --> 01:55:36.592]  And we'll document that coming up as well.
[01:55:36.592 --> 01:55:37.533]  Here it is.
[01:55:37.533 --> 01:55:39.574]  Then a real situation.
[01:55:39.574 --> 01:55:50.064]  This was the fourth year the agencies have participated in this drill, and organizers say the old adage, practice makes perfect, certainly holds true in the face of disaster.
[01:55:50.064 --> 01:55:52.266]  Jeremy Butterfield, News 7, Roanoke.
[01:55:53.058 --> 01:55:54.839]  Well, I guess you can never be too prepared.
[01:55:54.839 --> 01:55:59.220]  Something we should all keep in mind this week as we prepare for more rain.
[01:55:59.220 --> 01:56:00.240]  Isn't that right, Brian?
[01:56:00.240 --> 01:56:00.700]  That's right.
[01:56:00.700 --> 01:56:04.381]  Our preparation is going to be, take the umbrella with you as you head out tomorrow morning.
[01:56:04.381 --> 01:56:13.204]  In fact, a lot of... Let's go ahead and play the Clergy Response Team clip.
[01:56:13.204 --> 01:56:21.926]  Now remember, a year and a half before this was on local news in Louisiana, on local news in Idaho and several other states,
[01:56:23.666 --> 01:56:31.532]  Before this became national news, we got the secret documents from pastors who'd been recruited by FEMA.
[01:56:31.532 --> 01:56:34.754]  We posted the secret documents with FEMA phone numbers.
[01:56:34.754 --> 01:56:36.535]  Train your flocks to turn their guns in.
[01:56:36.535 --> 01:56:38.537]  Train your flocks to go to FEMA camps.
[01:56:38.537 --> 01:56:41.419]  Train your flocks to take forced inoculations.
[01:56:41.419 --> 01:56:43.861]  People didn't believe us, just like they didn't believe the MIAC report.
[01:56:45.706 --> 01:56:49.707]  Then, suddenly local news began reporting it, but like it was a good thing.
[01:56:49.707 --> 01:56:52.508]  Now listen, will martial law ever be a reality?
[01:56:52.508 --> 01:57:05.573]  And the preachers are there, being paid by the government, faith-based initiative now, continuing under Obama, to tell their flocks to do what they're told by the authorities, and the government's biggest threat is the American people.
[01:57:05.573 --> 01:57:06.153]  That's a quote.
[01:57:07.717 --> 01:57:12.621]  So, this is specifically the pastors getting ready for us to go to FEMA camps.
[01:57:12.621 --> 01:57:16.304]  And there's thousands of pieces of evidence like this, and Glenn Beck's saying it doesn't exist.
[01:57:16.304 --> 01:57:16.624]  Here it is.
[01:57:16.624 --> 01:57:21.609]  Some fear any nuclear, biological, or chemical attack on U.S.
[01:57:21.609 --> 01:57:24.171]  territory might trigger just that.
[01:57:24.171 --> 01:57:30.416]  NSKSLA News 12's Jeff Ferrell discovered the clergy would help the government with potentially their biggest problem.
[01:57:30.416 --> 01:57:31.136]  Stop it, guys.
[01:57:31.136 --> 01:57:32.237]  Back it up.
[01:57:32.237 --> 01:57:34.639]  It cut off about a second where she says martial law.
[01:57:34.639 --> 01:57:36.301]  I want folks to hear the full clip.
[01:57:37.648 --> 01:57:40.532]  Law ever become a reality in America?
[01:57:40.532 --> 01:57:44.917]  Some fear any nuclear, biological, or chemical attack on U.S.
[01:57:44.917 --> 01:57:47.440]  territory might trigger just that.
[01:57:47.440 --> 01:57:53.568]  And as KSLA News 12's Jeff Ferrell discovered, the clergy would help the government with potentially their biggest problem.
[01:57:54.418 --> 01:57:58.242]  From my cold dead hand!
[01:58:12.834 --> 01:58:13.154]  U.S.
[01:58:13.154 --> 01:58:14.675]  troops also arrived.
[01:58:14.675 --> 01:58:21.900]  Something far easier to do even now, thanks to last year's elimination of the 1878 Posse Comitatus Act.
[01:58:21.900 --> 01:58:23.060]  That forbid U.S.
[01:58:23.060 --> 01:58:27.323]  troops from policing on American soil.
[01:58:27.323 --> 01:58:31.626]  If martial law were enacted here at home, like depicted in the movie, The Siege... Alright, stay there.
[01:58:31.626 --> 01:58:33.147]  We're going to come back in one minute.
[01:58:33.147 --> 01:58:34.888]  We're jam-packed next hour.
[01:58:34.888 --> 01:58:35.888]  I'm detailing it all.
[01:58:35.888 --> 01:58:36.409]  Stay with us.
[01:58:42.503 --> 01:58:51.067]  If you are listening to GCN, visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:51.067 --> 01:58:51.688]  Hello, friends.
[01:58:51.688 --> 01:58:52.768]  This is Alex Jones.
[01:58:52.768 --> 01:58:57.511]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[01:58:57.511 --> 01:59:00.472]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[01:59:00.472 --> 01:59:03.514]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[01:59:03.514 --> 01:59:09.357]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency if you simply prepare.
[01:59:09.577 --> 01:59:12.819]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[01:59:12.819 --> 01:59:19.823]  You know efoodsdirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[01:59:19.823 --> 01:59:23.085]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[01:59:23.085 --> 01:59:24.966]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or on the web go to efoodsdirect.com.

[01:59:39.617 --> 01:59:40.237]  Take action today.
[01:59:40.237 --> 01:59:42.039]  The first step is getting storable food.
[01:59:53.860 --> 01:59:56.261]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:56.261 --> 02:00:05.524]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:05.524 --> 02:00:06.825]  Big Brother.
[02:00:06.825 --> 02:00:08.605]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:08.605 --> 02:00:10.366]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:10.366 --> 02:00:11.946]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.946 --> 02:00:12.887]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:12.887 --> 02:00:17.688]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.688 --> 02:00:21.750]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:24.745 --> 02:00:27.868]  Okay, so they're building FEMA camps all over the country.
[02:00:27.868 --> 02:00:29.169]  It's in the Houston Chronicle.
[02:00:29.169 --> 02:00:30.010]  It's in Reuters.
[02:00:30.010 --> 02:00:32.032]  It's in the Associated Press.
[02:00:32.032 --> 02:00:33.893]  They're announcing they're preparing for civil emergency.
[02:00:33.893 --> 02:00:38.758]  They have clergy response teams training their flocks to turn their guns in, go to FEMA camps.
[02:00:38.758 --> 02:00:42.681]  They're announcing everywhere troops are going to patrol the streets in mainstream news.
[02:00:42.681 --> 02:00:44.523]  And then Glenn Beck comes out and says, I'm one of you.
[02:00:44.523 --> 02:00:45.884]  I'm a patriot.
[02:00:45.884 --> 02:00:47.105]  I've done an investigation.
[02:00:47.105 --> 02:00:48.026]  None of this exists.
[02:00:48.026 --> 02:00:50.529]  Here's Popular Mechanics, the government mouthpiece.
[02:00:51.860 --> 02:00:59.165]  And so I'm going through some of the past stuff, and then we're going to really get into all the documentation coming up in the next segment, but here are the clergy response teams.
[02:00:59.165 --> 02:01:00.285]  Back that up about ten seconds.
[02:01:00.285 --> 02:01:01.186]  I want them to hear that.
[02:01:01.186 --> 02:01:06.289]  If martial law ever becomes a reality, it will be the pastors who pacify the public.
[02:01:06.289 --> 02:01:08.631]  Now remember, secret FEMA program.
[02:01:08.631 --> 02:01:10.692]  It was secret.
[02:01:10.692 --> 02:01:10.772]  Shh!
[02:01:10.772 --> 02:01:11.493]  Don't tell the public.
[02:01:11.493 --> 02:01:14.034]  We're going to pay you to read this to your flock.
[02:01:14.034 --> 02:01:14.995]  Tell them to take shots.
[02:01:14.995 --> 02:01:16.276]  Tell them to turn their guns in.
[02:01:16.276 --> 02:01:19.498]  Tell them Romans 13 to submit to a government takeover, okay?
[02:01:21.840 --> 02:01:23.281]  They're paying them to do this.
[02:01:23.281 --> 02:01:28.904]  That's why your church has got new vans and television sets and suddenly you're hearing your preachers say this.
[02:01:28.904 --> 02:01:31.125]  How creeping and un-American is that?
[02:01:31.125 --> 02:01:32.626]  Total violation of the First Amendment.
[02:01:32.626 --> 02:01:37.428]  Congress will make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.
[02:01:37.428 --> 02:01:38.509]  But now they're public.
[02:01:38.509 --> 02:01:40.350]  Okay, you expose our clergy response teams.
[02:01:40.350 --> 02:01:41.470]  We'll just admit it.
[02:01:41.470 --> 02:01:41.811]  Here it is.
[02:01:42.822 --> 02:01:49.610]  Now, thanks to last year's elimination of the 1878 Posse Comitatus Act, that forbid U.S.
[02:01:49.610 --> 02:01:51.632]  troops from policing on American soil.
[02:01:53.863 --> 02:02:01.505]  If martial law were enacted here at home, like depicted in the movie The Siege, easing public fears and quelling dissent would be critical.
[02:02:01.505 --> 02:02:07.146]  And that's exactly what the Clergy Response Team, as it's called, helped accomplish in New Orleans.
[02:02:07.146 --> 02:02:13.648]  Jeff, the primary thing that we say to anybody is let's cooperate and get this thing over with, and then we'll settle the differences once the crisis is over.
[02:02:13.988 --> 02:02:20.371]  Such clergy response teams would walk a tightrope between the needs of the government versus the wishes of the public.
[02:02:20.371 --> 02:02:27.515]  In a lot of cases, these clergy would already be known in the neighborhoods in which they're helping to defuse that situation.
[02:02:27.515 --> 02:02:35.339]  For the clergy, one of the biggest tools that they will have in helping calm the public down or obey the law is the Bible itself.
[02:02:35.339 --> 02:02:37.280]  Specifically, Romans.
[02:02:37.280 --> 02:02:37.700]  Romans 13.
[02:02:37.700 --> 02:02:40.162]  Because the government is established by the Lord.
[02:02:40.962 --> 02:02:41.542]  You know?
[02:02:41.542 --> 02:02:43.243]  And that's what we believe in the Christian faith.
[02:02:43.243 --> 02:02:45.063]  That's what's stated in the scripture.
[02:02:45.063 --> 02:02:54.906]  Civil rights advocates believe the amount of public cooperation may depend largely on how long they expect the suspension of their rights might last.
[02:02:54.906 --> 02:02:59.048]  Jeff Ferrell, KSLA News 12 reporting.
[02:02:59.048 --> 02:03:00.208]  And so that's what they're doing.
[02:03:00.208 --> 02:03:01.648]  Getting you ready for martial law.
[02:03:01.648 --> 02:03:03.229]  Getting you ready to go to FEMA camps.
[02:03:03.229 --> 02:03:05.250]  Publicly announced.
[02:03:05.250 --> 02:03:06.610]  But here's the problem.
[02:03:06.610 --> 02:03:08.631]  And I've always pointed this out.
[02:03:08.631 --> 02:03:09.671]  It's almost like it's on purpose.
[02:03:11.874 --> 02:03:23.646]  People will show, and I'm predicting Lynne Beck is going to attack us this way, they're going to show the 1990s video of the closed down Amtrak train system up by Chicago.
[02:03:23.646 --> 02:03:35.017]  They're going to do that and then what they're going to do is they're going to show the photos that are all over the web in Mississippi and Louisiana of mock
[02:03:37.000 --> 02:03:53.331]  Bosnia-Herzegovina slash Kosovo training camps, because the signs are in that, you know, Slavic language, where it has machine gun nests, checkpoints, barbed wire as a refugee camp, and they send the troops through for drills.
[02:03:53.331 --> 02:03:54.512]  And they're going to say, see?
[02:03:54.512 --> 02:03:56.613]  People said this was a camp.
[02:03:56.613 --> 02:03:57.734]  It's not really a camp.
[02:03:58.957 --> 02:04:01.399]  It's a place where they're doing drills.
[02:04:01.399 --> 02:04:04.902]  Oh, see, this is really just an Amtrak train track.
[02:04:04.902 --> 02:04:11.267]  We went out there, and yeah, it's got Barbara facing in, but it's not really a camp.
[02:04:11.267 --> 02:04:14.750]  They're not going to go over the executive orders that we're going to cover stating this.
[02:04:14.750 --> 02:04:16.712]  They're not going to go over PD51.
[02:04:16.712 --> 02:04:20.014]  They're not going to go over the military announcing they're getting ready for this.
[02:04:20.014 --> 02:04:21.516]  They're not going to cover the Houston Chronicle.
[02:04:22.751 --> 02:04:28.056]  If they do, that's what they're talking about, because he hinted at this two weeks ago, but kernels of truth.
[02:04:28.056 --> 02:04:31.879]  And yeah, they are getting ready for emergencies, but it's not a death camp.
[02:04:31.879 --> 02:04:33.661]  You know, it's a place for homeless people.
[02:04:33.661 --> 02:04:35.282]  That's what the new bill says.
[02:04:35.282 --> 02:04:37.905]  This is how they introduce the camps to you now.
[02:04:39.397 --> 02:04:45.404]  You know, it's not wrong to have the preacher secretly hired to tell you to go to a camp and to do what the government tells you.
[02:04:45.404 --> 02:04:47.426]  You know, it's not wrong to have your guns taken.
[02:04:47.426 --> 02:04:49.288]  I mean, it's of the Lord.
[02:04:49.288 --> 02:04:51.510]  Government's produced by the Lord.
[02:04:51.510 --> 02:04:52.792]  Hitler said that.
[02:04:52.792 --> 02:04:53.633]  Romans 13.
[02:04:53.633 --> 02:04:54.193]  Gotta do it.
[02:04:54.193 --> 02:04:55.655]  We'll be right back.
[02:04:55.655 --> 02:04:56.156]  Stay with us.
[02:04:56.156 --> 02:05:00.160]  And if you don't like any of this, then you're a paranoid crazy.
[02:05:00.160 --> 02:05:00.781]  We'll be right back.
[02:05:01.610 --> 02:05:06.134]  Are you fed up with all the side effects of chemicals in your shampoos and detergents?
[02:05:06.134 --> 02:05:11.239]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[02:05:11.239 --> 02:05:12.740]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:05:12.740 --> 02:05:16.344]  Why not go back to basics and be safe with Calbin Pure Soaps?

[02:05:36.517 --> 02:05:37.717]  No animal testing.
[02:05:37.717 --> 02:05:39.058]  I use them and love them.
[02:05:39.058 --> 02:05:40.939]  Knowing they're all natural and safe.

[02:06:02.126 --> 02:06:07.368]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[02:06:08.164 --> 02:06:14.029]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[02:06:14.029 --> 02:06:20.534]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[02:06:20.534 --> 02:06:22.516]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[02:06:22.516 --> 02:06:24.978]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[02:06:24.978 --> 02:06:35.867]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[02:06:38.149 --> 02:06:39.810]  It's not about left or right.
[02:06:39.810 --> 02:06:41.670]  It's about a one-world government.
[02:06:41.670 --> 02:06:48.593]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[02:06:48.593 --> 02:06:56.836]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:06:56.836 --> 02:06:58.416]  The Obama Deception.
[02:06:58.416 --> 02:06:59.617]  The people strike back.
[02:07:02.066 --> 02:07:07.568]  Millions of Americans are beginning to realize the enormity of the economic and political problems facing the U.S.
[02:07:07.568 --> 02:07:08.369]  and the world.
[02:07:08.369 --> 02:07:12.230]  And for the first time in their lives, they are feeling the need for preparedness.
[02:07:12.230 --> 02:07:18.733]  Ready Reserve Foods has been in continuous operation, manufacturing the finest and dehydrated foods for almost 40 years.
[02:07:18.733 --> 02:07:20.754]  Ready Reserve is the manufacturer.
[02:07:20.754 --> 02:07:28.697]  Unlike other companies that just broker canned foods, Ready Reserve controls the quality from start to finish with double enameled cans and nitrogen packaging.

[02:07:33.680 --> 02:07:39.484]  Other companies are quoting delivery times of one to two months, while Ready Reserve ships within five business days.
[02:07:39.484 --> 02:07:41.665]  Many companies do not even offer a catalog.
[02:07:41.665 --> 02:07:43.907]  We will be more than happy to send a catalog to you.

[02:07:47.310 --> 02:07:47.851]  Factory direct.
[02:07:47.851 --> 02:07:49.452]  Wholesale pricing from Ready Reserve Foods.
[02:07:49.452 --> 02:07:50.133]  Call us at 1-800-453-2202.
[02:07:50.133 --> 02:07:51.515]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:07:51.515 --> 02:07:52.916]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:16.872 --> 02:08:20.237]  We also have the federal government taking over the Internet.
[02:08:20.237 --> 02:08:29.089]  Obama's saying he's going to take over all the private industries that control the hubs, where the government will be plugged into it so they can, quote, censor things, spy on everyone without warrants.
[02:08:29.089 --> 02:08:33.134]  That's a Mother Jones Magazine headline, Should Obama Control the Internet?
[02:08:34.417 --> 02:08:35.077]  Here's another one.
[02:08:35.077 --> 02:08:38.439]  America's Secret Police, MSNBC.
[02:08:38.439 --> 02:08:44.401]  Intelligence experts warn the proposal to merge two Pentagon intelligence units could create an ominous new agency.
[02:08:44.401 --> 02:08:52.904]  And the head of cyber security just resigned three weeks ago saying the Pentagon and Homeland Security are taking over the internet and it's a threat to freedom in America.
[02:08:52.904 --> 02:08:56.385]  So their own guys quitting saying this takeover is happening.
[02:08:56.385 --> 02:09:02.548]  All the radio and TV in the nation under the emergency alert system in 96 under federal law and executive order
[02:09:03.288 --> 02:09:13.511]  FEMA is wired into the transmitters themselves and cable to take over all the systems and broadcast anytime they want before the stations would tune to a signal themselves.
[02:09:13.511 --> 02:09:15.712]  Now that's out of their hands.
[02:09:15.712 --> 02:09:17.393]  All of that's going on.
[02:09:17.393 --> 02:09:24.415]  So see, they've got the preachers, they've got the citizens, they've got the military prepared for martial law to go into FEMA camps.
[02:09:27.247 --> 02:09:32.950]  And then we've got all these mainstream news articles like the Houston Chronicle about the FEMA camps.
[02:09:32.950 --> 02:09:38.372]  So let's go ahead and go over the stack of news titled FEMA Camps.
[02:09:38.372 --> 02:09:40.773]  Here is the text of H.R.
[02:09:40.773 --> 02:09:44.175]  645 National Emergency Centers Establishment Act.
[02:09:44.175 --> 02:09:48.257]  This says the clergy response teams will run these with the feds.
[02:09:48.257 --> 02:09:49.958]  The local police will be part of it.
[02:09:49.958 --> 02:09:51.999]  They will have medical care, a nightly movie.
[02:09:53.055 --> 02:09:57.516]  This is exactly how we reverse engineered it before they announced this and said this is what the camps will look like.
[02:09:57.516 --> 02:10:05.578]  They're going to advertise as they make us all homeless with controlled economic collapse like we want to go to the FEMA camps.
[02:10:05.578 --> 02:10:12.979]  And so that's how they're advertising these as a wonderful place you want to go to and that the pastors are going to be there.
[02:10:12.979 --> 02:10:17.740]  And so that's how they first advertise them as things collapse.
[02:10:17.740 --> 02:10:22.421]  New legislation authorizes FEMA camps in the United States.
[02:10:24.592 --> 02:10:26.614]  Here is Wall Street Journal.
[02:10:26.614 --> 02:10:38.363]  KBR awarded Homeland Security contract worth up to $385 million to build three one million person FEMA camps in the United States.
[02:10:38.363 --> 02:10:44.849]  It says the ICE detention and removal operations program can be used for illegal aliens and for U.S.
[02:10:44.849 --> 02:10:48.211]  citizens and for other emergencies.
[02:10:48.211 --> 02:10:49.753]  Here's the New York Times.
[02:10:51.343 --> 02:11:07.365]  Halliburton subsidiary gets contract to add temporary immigration detention centers just like under Rex 84 the documents came out in the 80s they said the cover would be for illegal aliens but it would be a really a martial law takeover plan to suspend the Constitution and take over the media.
[02:11:07.785 --> 02:11:12.409]  So there's the New York Times we have saved up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:11:12.409 --> 02:11:19.795]  Also, George Bush reopened all the Japanese and German prisoner of war camps in the U.S.
[02:11:19.795 --> 02:11:23.758]  and put water in, light in, and then just have them set up and ready.
[02:11:23.758 --> 02:11:30.163]  That was in the CBS News, Bush to preserve World War II internment camps.
[02:11:30.163 --> 02:11:31.565]  So there's that article.
[02:11:32.918 --> 02:11:39.221]  Now I thought I would go over Executive Orders for you.
[02:11:39.221 --> 02:11:40.902]  Executive Orders.
[02:11:40.902 --> 02:11:43.943]  In fact, you can just Google Executive Order 11,000.
[02:11:43.943 --> 02:11:49.086]  This has been reaffirmed by every subsequent President.
[02:11:49.086 --> 02:11:56.670]  Assessing Emergency Preparedness Functions to the Secretary of Labor.
[02:11:58.757 --> 02:12:00.858]  And this is just one of the executive orders.
[02:12:00.858 --> 02:12:05.001]  You can go read 11,000 for yourself.
[02:12:05.001 --> 02:12:10.125]  Allows the government to mobilize civilians into work brigades under government supervision.
[02:12:10.125 --> 02:12:11.746]  And see, how's it being introduced now?
[02:12:11.746 --> 02:12:15.648]  Oh, we've got bills for compulsory national service.
[02:12:15.648 --> 02:12:19.751]  Oh, if you want to go to high school and college, you know, 18 to 25, you'll have to serve.
[02:12:19.751 --> 02:12:21.632]  And oh, we're going to have a Green Corps.
[02:12:21.632 --> 02:12:26.716]  And as society implodes, we're going to give you a national ID card that has some money credits on it.
[02:12:27.895 --> 02:12:29.456]  This is how they introduce you.
[02:12:29.456 --> 02:12:30.936]  See, they're introducing it all.
[02:12:30.936 --> 02:12:33.677]  They've denied they're building all this for all these decades.
[02:12:33.677 --> 02:12:37.659]  Now as they unveil it, they're putting their PR spin on it.
[02:12:37.659 --> 02:12:44.302]  So Executive Order 10990 allows the government to take over all modes of transportation and control of highways and seaports.
[02:12:44.302 --> 02:12:45.742]  That's been reaffirmed under PDD 51.
[02:12:47.560 --> 02:12:50.262]  Under the John Warner Defense Authorization Act and others.
[02:12:50.262 --> 02:12:55.706]  Executive Order 10995 allows the government to seize and control the communication media.
[02:12:55.706 --> 02:13:01.090]  That's now been put in by the Emergency Alert System.
[02:13:01.090 --> 02:13:08.836]  Executive Order 10997 allows the government to take over all electrical power, gas, petroleum, fuels and minerals.
[02:13:08.836 --> 02:13:11.217]  That's been reaffirmed in all the other laws.
[02:13:11.217 --> 02:13:11.918]  Executive Order 10998
[02:13:14.110 --> 02:13:21.777]  Allows the government to seize all means of transportation including personal cars, trucks, and vehicles of any kind and total control over all highways, seaports, and waterways.
[02:13:21.777 --> 02:13:23.078]  Go read it for yourself.
[02:13:23.078 --> 02:13:29.363]  Executive Order 10999 allows the government to take over all food resources and farms.
[02:13:29.363 --> 02:13:35.108]  Executive Order 11000 allows the government to mobilize civilians into work brigades under government supervision.
[02:13:35.108 --> 02:13:35.589]  Executive Order 11001
[02:13:38.877 --> 02:13:42.702]  Allows the government to take over all health, education, welfare functions.
[02:13:42.702 --> 02:13:47.428]  What's happening through the imploded economy that the foreign central banks are engineering?
[02:13:47.428 --> 02:13:50.351]  Do they make you be beholden to the government?
[02:13:50.351 --> 02:13:54.396]  Designates the Postmaster General to operate a national registration of all persons.
[02:13:55.475 --> 02:13:57.557]  That goes on through the Selective Service.
[02:13:57.557 --> 02:14:03.561]  Executive Order 11003 allows the government to take over all airports, aircraft, including commercial aircraft.
[02:14:03.561 --> 02:14:06.103]  Remember when they shut down all flights after 9-11.
[02:14:06.103 --> 02:14:16.632]  Executive Order 11004 allows the Housing and Finance Authority to relocate communities, build new housing with public funds, designate areas to be abandoned, and establish new locations for populations.
[02:14:16.632 --> 02:14:18.814]  Remember Louisiana, Mississippi, Katrina?
[02:14:19.767 --> 02:14:26.130]  Executive Order 11005 allows the government to take over all railroads, inland waterways, and public storage facilities.
[02:14:26.130 --> 02:14:39.758]  Executive Order 11051 specifies the responsibility of the Office of Emergency Planning and gives authorization to put all executive orders into effect in times of increased international tensions and economic or financial crises.
[02:14:39.758 --> 02:14:40.358]  Executive Order 11310
[02:14:42.239 --> 02:14:55.827]  Grants authority of the Department of Justice to enforce the plans set out in Executive Orders to institute industrial support, to establish judicial and legislative liaison, to control all aliens, to operate penal and correctional institutions, and to advise and assist the President.
[02:14:55.827 --> 02:14:57.548]  So that's your FEMA camps.
[02:14:57.548 --> 02:15:08.335]  Executive Order 11,049 assigns emergency preparedness functions to federal departments and agencies, consolidating 21 operational Executive Orders issued at 15-year period.
[02:15:08.335 --> 02:15:08.875]  Executive Order 11,921
[02:15:11.537 --> 02:15:20.659]  Also, allows the federal emergency preparedness to develop plans to establish control over the mechanisms of production and distribution of energy sources.
[02:15:20.659 --> 02:15:24.300]  See how Obama's now firing the head of GM and saying they'll fire more?
[02:15:24.300 --> 02:15:27.101]  They're just setting the precedence, setting the precedence.
[02:15:27.101 --> 02:15:30.122]  All this set up for decades, now coming to a head now.
[02:15:30.122 --> 02:15:31.842]  See, this isn't just in executive orders now.
[02:15:31.842 --> 02:15:34.563]  Now it's announced on the news, how it's for your own good.
[02:15:34.563 --> 02:15:38.104]  But if you don't like it, Glenn Beck says you should be arrested and it doesn't exist.
[02:15:39.963 --> 02:15:50.406]  Allows the Federal Emergency Preparedness Agency to develop plans to abolish and establish control over the mechanisms of production and distribution of energy sources, wage salaries, credit, and the flow of money in U.S.
[02:15:50.406 --> 02:15:53.427]  financial institutions, and any undefined national emergency.
[02:15:53.427 --> 02:16:00.309]  It also provides that when a state of emergency is declared by the President, Congress cannot review the action for six months.
[02:16:00.309 --> 02:16:00.829]  PDD 51 says never.
[02:16:05.967 --> 02:16:11.831]  The Federal Emergency Management Agency has broad powers in the event of every aspect of the nation.
[02:16:11.831 --> 02:16:31.402]  General Frank Salazindo, Chief of FEMA's Civil Security Division, stated in a press conference that he saw FEMA's role as the new frontier of protection of individual government leaders from assassination and or civil military installations, from sabotage and attack, as well as prevention of dissident groups from gaining access to U.S.
[02:16:31.402 --> 02:16:31.803]  opinion.
[02:16:32.843 --> 02:16:35.744]  Or a global audience in times of crisis.
[02:16:35.744 --> 02:16:44.125]  FEMA powers were consolidated by President Carter to incorporate the National Security Act of 47 and to expand that.
[02:16:44.125 --> 02:16:51.787]  So you heard them in a public press conference as well as the prevention of dissident groups from gaining access to U.S.
[02:16:51.787 --> 02:16:52.787]  opinion.
[02:16:52.787 --> 02:16:55.108]  And see, here is Mother Jones.
[02:16:55.108 --> 02:16:56.828]  Should Obama control the Internet?
[02:16:58.305 --> 02:17:00.207]  You see this right here?
[02:17:00.207 --> 02:17:02.209]  Should Obama control the internet?
[02:17:02.209 --> 02:17:03.030]  Mother Jones!
[02:17:04.170 --> 02:17:21.142]  And it says right here, Senator John Rockefeller, goes by J Rockefeller, has announced they need to end the internet, that it's bad, and that private companies will have government hubs tied into them to snoop on everyone without warrants and to be able to shut down the web instantly.
[02:17:21.142 --> 02:17:24.904]  See, right now the government has to get warrants and go out and seize all the hubs.
[02:17:24.904 --> 02:17:28.026]  But this is the same thing as the Telecommunications Act of 96.
[02:17:29.878 --> 02:17:36.060]  That made it law that all cell phones had to be tracked down to three feet and they could remotely listen to you even when the cell phone's off.
[02:17:36.060 --> 02:17:45.143]  That standardized the cell phones and all telecommunications companies were given nine billion dollars total to put in whole floors for the NSA to move into.
[02:17:45.143 --> 02:17:48.544]  So the NSA doesn't tap the phone companies, they are the phone companies.
[02:17:48.544 --> 02:17:57.866]  Just like FEMA on all radio, TV, cable, you name it, is already in control with hubs at the transmitter site or at the satellite uplink site.
[02:17:57.866 --> 02:17:59.227]  The last piece of equipment
[02:17:59.707 --> 02:18:02.389]  This is in my film Police State 2000, by the way.
[02:18:02.389 --> 02:18:07.013]  The last piece of equipment, in fact, pull up Police State 2000 on YouTube.
[02:18:07.013 --> 02:18:10.075]  It'll be the last part, like part 13 or whatever.
[02:18:10.075 --> 02:18:15.799]  Go to the very last five minutes and it shows me showing an EAS system in the radio station.
[02:18:15.799 --> 02:18:22.485]  See, I was sitting there talking to the engineer in 1996 at KJFK-FM.
[02:18:22.485 --> 02:18:23.866]  The engineer is since deceased.
[02:18:24.983 --> 02:18:27.445]  And he calls me over and goes, look at this Alex, they're ordering us to do this.
[02:18:27.445 --> 02:18:28.987]  Here's all the secret documents.
[02:18:28.987 --> 02:18:30.808]  We're not supposed to show this to anybody.
[02:18:30.808 --> 02:18:32.090]  And I was sitting there reading it.
[02:18:32.090 --> 02:18:33.411]  FEMA takes over through this.
[02:18:33.411 --> 02:18:35.913]  Everything you do goes through this system.
[02:18:35.913 --> 02:18:39.116]  I mean, that's what you hear when it goes brrk, brrk, brrk.
[02:18:39.116 --> 02:18:42.099]  You know, this has been an emergency alert system.
[02:18:42.099 --> 02:18:50.707]  That is a federal test tone going via shortwave radio transmitters, dials in, and takes control of your radio station.
[02:18:53.288 --> 02:18:55.269]  Paul, you know you run TV and radio shows.
[02:18:55.269 --> 02:18:58.972]  You know those boxes there that you get alerts with a little ticker tape coming out of?
[02:18:58.972 --> 02:19:02.334]  That's FEMA testing taking over your station.
[02:19:02.334 --> 02:19:03.754]  And that's what they say right here.
[02:19:03.754 --> 02:19:10.379]  During emergencies, when they're rounding people up and arresting them and shooting people, their job is to keep the media shut down.
[02:19:10.379 --> 02:19:12.120]  They don't have to come arrest Alex Jones.
[02:19:12.120 --> 02:19:14.521]  They hit one button, the internet shuts off.
[02:19:14.521 --> 02:19:16.222]  They hit one button, TV shuts off.
[02:19:16.222 --> 02:19:17.103]  But it's not going to shut off.
[02:19:18.311 --> 02:19:26.881]  You go to Infowars.com when this happens, it's going to direct you to WhiteHouse.gov and all their propaganda and all their BS.
[02:19:26.881 --> 02:19:34.649]  So when they take all your pension funds, when they bankrupt the economy, when they set up open world government, which they stated they're doing, and bankrupt you, you can't do anything.
[02:19:34.649 --> 02:19:39.495]  Glenn Beck will be on TV, though, going, oh, none of this is happening, or, oh, it's for your own good, you can trust me.
[02:19:42.662 --> 02:19:44.024]  Total takeover of the internet.
[02:19:44.024 --> 02:19:45.145]  That's coming up later.
[02:19:45.145 --> 02:19:47.528]  Okay, I've covered some executive orders.
[02:19:47.528 --> 02:19:59.421]  Now I want to get more into the FEMA camps themselves and how they're set up versus the strawman arguments where Beck and others point to people that have wrongly identified some installations as FEMA camps when they aren't.
[02:19:59.421 --> 02:19:59.822]  Stay with us.
[02:20:01.354 --> 02:20:04.876]  Before you throw away your used batteries, you need to listen to this.
[02:20:04.876 --> 02:20:06.797]  Now, going green can save money.
[02:20:06.797 --> 02:20:12.360]  Go green and save money by giving life to your used batteries by charging them with the Renaissance Charger.

[02:20:49.851 --> 02:20:51.052]  Be a part of the revolution today.
[02:20:51.052 --> 02:20:52.593]  In the new world orders war against humanity.
[02:21:04.969 --> 02:21:07.591]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[02:21:07.591 --> 02:21:14.575]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[02:21:15.163 --> 02:21:21.745]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[02:21:21.745 --> 02:21:23.725]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[02:21:23.725 --> 02:21:26.226]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[02:21:26.226 --> 02:21:37.169]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[02:21:37.794 --> 02:21:39.475]  It's not about left or right.
[02:21:39.475 --> 02:21:41.337]  It's about a one world government.
[02:21:41.337 --> 02:21:48.241]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[02:21:48.241 --> 02:21:56.507]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at Infowars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:21:56.507 --> 02:21:58.068]  The Obama Deception.
[02:21:58.068 --> 02:22:01.091]  The people strike back.
[02:22:01.091 --> 02:22:07.295]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[02:22:07.751 --> 02:22:15.877]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[02:22:15.877 --> 02:22:24.043]  Is this a flaw-free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[02:22:24.043 --> 02:22:29.147]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[02:22:29.147 --> 02:22:33.771]  Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[02:22:34.338 --> 02:22:38.699]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of International Banking Cartel.
[02:22:38.699 --> 02:22:39.780]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:22:39.780 --> 02:22:44.281]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.
[02:22:44.281 --> 02:22:49.183]  Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today.
[02:22:49.183 --> 02:22:52.184]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.
[02:22:52.184 --> 02:22:53.964]  Call and order your copy today at 1-800-686-2237.
[02:22:53.964 --> 02:22:54.184]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:23:00.876 --> 02:23:02.857]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[02:23:02.857 --> 02:23:08.220]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[02:23:08.220 --> 02:23:09.820]  But the symptoms are there.
[02:23:09.820 --> 02:23:18.224]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[02:23:18.224 --> 02:23:23.947]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[02:23:24.107 --> 02:23:25.948]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[02:23:25.948 --> 02:23:28.149]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[02:23:28.149 --> 02:23:32.671]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[02:23:32.671 --> 02:23:34.892]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[02:23:34.892 --> 02:23:42.715]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[02:23:42.895 --> 02:23:45.676]  Alright, we got a long way to go and a short time to get there.
[02:23:45.676 --> 02:23:48.277]  Let's continue with the news and information.
[02:24:13.359 --> 02:24:16.000]  Why is the text of H.R.
[02:24:16.000 --> 02:24:20.781]  645, the National Emergency Centers Establishment Act, so important?
[02:24:20.781 --> 02:24:26.922]  This tells you what the camps look like, where they've been set up, what's been done.
[02:24:26.922 --> 02:24:32.244]  And it says six major camps across the country with hundreds of sub-region camps.
[02:24:32.244 --> 02:24:41.286]  Now if you watch my films and read the documents we put out, that's exactly what we said the camps are and how they operate because we reverse engineered all this.
[02:24:42.426 --> 02:24:43.829]  The camps are already built.
[02:24:43.829 --> 02:24:52.105]  It's kind of like they say, oh, we passed a law, the NSA can spy on you without having it be a felony.
[02:24:52.105 --> 02:24:53.467]  But by the way, we've been doing it for 30 years.
[02:24:54.989 --> 02:24:59.692]  It's when they want to openly announce they're doing it, that they then pass a law.
[02:24:59.692 --> 02:25:14.502]  And they say, oh, all these shut down military bases that they've been keeping refurbished and putting barbed wire facing in and putting in showers and bunks, we knew that those were to be the FEMA camps.
[02:25:14.502 --> 02:25:17.284]  Because in the FEMA documents and the congressional leaks,
[02:25:18.384 --> 02:25:22.587]  And from people that worked at the camps, we knew, and we would list the camps.
[02:25:22.587 --> 02:25:35.975]  Then we noticed, when it was declassified in 97, that the very camps that had been, quote, decommissioned under the base closure, because they'd said back in the 80s, under Rex 84, they were going to use the camps in Congress.
[02:25:35.975 --> 02:25:37.516]  So we said, you want to know where the camps are?
[02:25:37.516 --> 02:25:44.980]  They're old military bases, and they're old POW camps from Italians, Germans, and Japanese.
[02:25:44.980 --> 02:25:45.681]  Guess what's in here?
[02:25:47.096 --> 02:25:49.857]  Guess what's in the bill?
[02:25:49.857 --> 02:25:55.959]  They're only legalizing and publicly announcing what they've already set up, and it dovetails with this.
[02:25:55.959 --> 02:25:59.901]  Now, Glenn Beck will not talk about this.
[02:25:59.901 --> 02:26:05.283]  Civilian Inmate Labor Camp Program Army Regulation 210-35.
[02:26:05.283 --> 02:26:07.704]  Now, this grows all the time.
[02:26:07.704 --> 02:26:12.245]  In fact, put it up on screen, guys, and just roll through the pages for folks.
[02:26:12.245 --> 02:26:13.906]  Now, this is the big piece of news.
[02:26:15.529 --> 02:26:22.071]  This is to establish, setting up, prison labor camps.
[02:26:22.071 --> 02:26:27.273]  Negotiations with correctional systems representing representatives to establish prison camps.
[02:26:27.273 --> 02:26:30.234]  Governing criteria, civilian inmate labor camps.
[02:26:30.234 --> 02:26:32.174]  Policy statement.
[02:26:32.174 --> 02:26:36.716]  Governing provisions for operating civilian inmate prison camps on army installations.
[02:26:36.716 --> 02:26:40.757]  Procedures for establishing a civilian inmate prison camp on army installations.
[02:26:42.051 --> 02:26:47.135]  Infrastructure, inter-service, inter-agency, and inter-departmental support agreements.
[02:26:47.135 --> 02:26:50.557]  Working with local police at the FEMA camps.
[02:26:50.557 --> 02:26:55.241]  Incident reports, media coverage.
[02:26:55.241 --> 02:26:59.664]  Any media coverage involving inmates participating in civilian inmate labor camp program.
[02:26:59.664 --> 02:27:07.429]  But see, FEMA never has to take over the media with their FEMA control boxes and all radio, TV, and cable.
[02:27:07.429 --> 02:27:08.190]  And now the internet.
[02:27:09.301 --> 02:27:12.282]  Because it's willing accomplices in the media.
[02:27:12.282 --> 02:27:26.468]  But now the alternative media has gotten so big, the Congressional hearings, the Violent Radicalization Act, and all of them are saying they're going to shut down 9-11 Truth, they're going to shut down pro-gun groups, they're going to shut your websites down, and they are stating it.
[02:27:26.468 --> 02:27:28.229]  The New York Times stated it.
[02:27:28.229 --> 02:27:31.170]  For your own good, they're going to do this.
[02:27:31.170 --> 02:27:32.251]  Europe's announcing it.
[02:27:32.251 --> 02:27:35.132]  Australia's announcing censorship of anyone critical of the government.
[02:27:35.970 --> 02:27:41.092]  These criminals are going for broke, robbing and looting everything, so they are moving.
[02:27:41.092 --> 02:27:43.572]  So, so, you'll never hear Glenn Beck talk about this.
[02:27:43.572 --> 02:27:48.314]  This sucker was set up in 1986 at 12 camps.
[02:27:48.314 --> 02:27:49.334]  It's since doubled to 24.
[02:27:49.334 --> 02:27:51.875]  You want to read the camps?
[02:27:51.875 --> 02:27:53.415]  You can read the installations.
[02:27:53.415 --> 02:27:55.576]  In fact, pull up the page that's got the installations listed.
[02:27:57.972 --> 02:28:00.855]  Red River Army Depot, Anniston, Alabama.
[02:28:00.855 --> 02:28:02.917]  You know, it goes through them.
[02:28:02.917 --> 02:28:08.883]  And from 86 to 97, secretly, at labor camps, U.S.
[02:28:08.883 --> 02:28:15.730]  citizens, non-military prisoners, were worked on FEMA camps.
[02:28:15.730 --> 02:28:17.032]  Now, this was beta testing.
[02:28:17.898 --> 02:28:25.406]  They would tell them, you'll be given leniency and only serve half your sentence if you agree to labor.
[02:28:25.406 --> 02:28:31.292]  The minute you don't, you'll be sent back on these military bases, but you can't tell anybody national security.
[02:28:31.292 --> 02:28:35.796]  See, they were testing, can we keep camp secret from local police or get them to work with us?
[02:28:35.796 --> 02:28:37.818]  Can we keep camp secret from the media?
[02:28:37.818 --> 02:28:41.242]  So for 11 years, they kept this sucker secret.
[02:28:42.958 --> 02:28:44.959]  Reagan, Bush, Clinton.
[02:28:44.959 --> 02:28:52.281]  And then Clinton declassifies it and says it's a good thing in 97 and they double the number.
[02:28:52.281 --> 02:28:54.662]  So here it is, the big kahuna.
[02:28:54.662 --> 02:29:05.685]  This is just one section of these training the troops, training the infrastructure, creating the larger cadres to expand the archipelago of gulags.
[02:29:05.685 --> 02:29:06.726]  And you can
[02:29:08.211 --> 02:29:10.592]  Go and read all the locations.
[02:29:10.592 --> 02:29:16.034]  Do a control F on the document and just type locations or installations and it'll pull it up on screen.
[02:29:16.034 --> 02:29:17.355]  I should have.
[02:29:17.355 --> 02:29:23.817]  I had a highlighted copy of this and I can't find it around the office so I just printed it again.
[02:29:23.817 --> 02:29:26.479]  You want a list of places these camps are at?
[02:29:26.479 --> 02:29:27.319]  We'll give you a list.
[02:29:30.342 --> 02:29:34.564]  I mean, you can go to army.mil right now and read this for yourself.
[02:29:34.564 --> 02:29:36.885]  But see, Glenn Beck won't tell you about this.
[02:29:36.885 --> 02:29:46.428]  We'll come back, get into the preparation for the camps, how they're going to use the troops against the people with the police, mass graves, and a lot more, how all this ties together.
[02:29:46.428 --> 02:29:51.570]  Stay with us.
[02:29:51.570 --> 02:29:52.951]  We're on the march.
[02:29:52.951 --> 02:29:55.492]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.492 --> 02:29:58.153]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.454 --> 02:30:03.735]  Do you depend on the grocery store for your food?
[02:30:03.735 --> 02:30:05.896]  It's time to think outside the box.
[02:30:05.896 --> 02:30:07.856]  How about starting your own garden?
[02:30:07.856 --> 02:30:10.117]  To ensure your future, you purchase the seeds.

[02:31:01.952 --> 02:31:08.002]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[02:31:08.002 --> 02:31:13.270]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[02:31:13.869 --> 02:31:20.352]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[02:31:20.352 --> 02:31:22.332]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[02:31:22.332 --> 02:31:24.793]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[02:31:24.793 --> 02:31:37.979]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[02:31:37.979 --> 02:31:39.659]  It's not about left or right.
[02:31:39.659 --> 02:31:41.020]  It's about a one-world government.
[02:31:41.508 --> 02:31:48.411]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[02:31:48.411 --> 02:31:56.674]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:31:56.674 --> 02:31:58.254]  The Obama Deception.
[02:31:58.254 --> 02:31:59.435]  The people strike back.
[02:32:01.443 --> 02:32:04.945]  Attention gardeners, this is an urgent GCN self-reliance update.
[02:32:04.945 --> 02:32:09.468]  GCN has just discovered a new bioactive superfood for garden plants, flowers, and herbs.
[02:32:09.468 --> 02:32:17.352]  It's called ProtoGrow and it's so effective at producing rapid plant growth that it seems to almost force plants to grow like crazy under practically any soil and light conditions.
[02:32:17.659 --> 02:32:20.781]  Now, here's the best part for our listeners who garden for self-reliance.
[02:32:20.781 --> 02:32:28.424]  Proto-Gro's unique blend of sea nutrients maximizes mineral uptake and dramatically increases bloom set, creating maximum plant growth in minimum time.
[02:32:28.424 --> 02:32:33.987]  Proto-Gro works by providing geometric keys which have the capacity to actually unlock the genetic code for nutritional uptake in plants.
[02:32:34.167 --> 02:32:34.707]  Federal agents!
[02:32:34.707 --> 02:32:35.367]  We are armed!
[02:33:04.669 --> 02:33:09.591]  What would you do if you Knew all the things we knew?
[02:33:09.591 --> 02:33:11.692]  Would you stand up for truth?
[02:33:11.692 --> 02:33:14.973]  Or would you turn away too?
[02:33:14.973 --> 02:33:20.055]  And then what if you saw All of the things that's wrong?
[02:33:20.055 --> 02:33:22.756]  Would you stand tall and strong?
[02:33:22.756 --> 02:33:25.917]  Or would you turn and walk away?
[02:33:25.917 --> 02:33:30.458]  What would you do if you Knew all the things we knew?
[02:33:30.458 --> 02:33:32.339]  Would you stand up for truth?
[02:33:35.481 --> 02:33:39.604]  So, Civilian Inmate Labor Camp Program.
[02:33:39.604 --> 02:33:43.407]  Locations all across the United States.
[02:33:43.407 --> 02:33:48.950]  Declassified in 1997 for 11 years.
[02:33:48.950 --> 02:33:53.714]  Non-military prisoners being held at labor camps.
[02:33:53.714 --> 02:33:55.615]  And you never heard about it in the news.
[02:33:55.615 --> 02:33:56.836]  You never heard about it in the media.
[02:33:58.556 --> 02:34:08.539]  We had secret copies of this when I first got on air in about 95-96 with just the cover sheet of it and people made fun of us and didn't believe it.
[02:34:08.539 --> 02:34:09.639]  Then it was declassified.
[02:34:09.639 --> 02:34:13.200]  This is from army.mil.
[02:34:13.200 --> 02:34:16.361]  Now, what am I predicting Glenn Beck's going to do tonight?
[02:34:16.361 --> 02:34:18.122]  What have I been predicting for weeks he's going to do?
[02:34:19.679 --> 02:34:26.989]  He is going to come out and say, look at this, this is just a regular prison, and they're taking photos of it and saying it's a camp.
[02:34:26.989 --> 02:34:33.378]  Oh, look at this, there's a Colonel of Truth, they have introduced a bill for during emergencies to have FEMA places for folks to go.
[02:34:33.378 --> 02:34:36.702]  I mean, they've got to do that, you know, like Katrina.
[02:34:37.603 --> 02:34:38.384]  Oh, look at this!
[02:34:38.384 --> 02:34:42.827]  This is an army training facility for a refugee camp simulation.
[02:34:42.827 --> 02:34:45.889]  Oh, look at what they've... I mean, I know how they operate.
[02:34:45.889 --> 02:34:48.391]  I know how Popular Mechanics operates.
[02:34:48.391 --> 02:34:54.635]  I mean, I was right about Glenn Beck setting you up when he said he was gonna expose the FEMA camps, and I said, you watch, he's gonna debunk them.
[02:34:56.374 --> 02:34:58.055]  I understand these people.
[02:34:58.055 --> 02:35:01.336]  Because he reads off a script, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:35:01.336 --> 02:35:03.998]  I know the sheet of music he's singing off of.
[02:35:03.998 --> 02:35:07.159]  I know the next line in the chorus.
[02:35:07.159 --> 02:35:09.680]  This stuff is scripted.
[02:35:09.680 --> 02:35:12.922]  So you've got the civilian inmate labor camp program going strong.
[02:35:14.502 --> 02:35:16.023]  We've gone over the executive orders.
[02:35:16.023 --> 02:35:18.505]  Then we have preparation.
[02:35:18.505 --> 02:35:20.666]  How are they preparing the public?
[02:35:20.666 --> 02:35:25.069]  When I saw this at the time, I saw Tommy Franks and Chigar Aficionado.
[02:35:25.069 --> 02:35:36.196]  I saw Tommy Franks on CNN, Fox, MSNBC go, gee, I'm real sorry about this, but one more big terror attack, we're going to have a military form of government and martial law.
[02:35:36.196 --> 02:35:41.339]  I'm real sad about that, but that's what the American people are going to demand.
[02:35:41.339 --> 02:35:42.860]  That's the only thing that will keep them safe.
[02:35:44.059 --> 02:35:47.903]  Now, you don't expect him to come out and say, gee, we're going to have a military dictatorship.
[02:35:47.903 --> 02:35:53.668]  Militaries throughout history love taking over societies 99% of the time, and America's just been the exception.
[02:35:53.668 --> 02:36:01.435]  No, he's got to introduce it like, gee, shuck, I'm real upset, but it is the only thing that will keep us safe.
[02:36:01.435 --> 02:36:04.879]  The Constitution won't survive a WMD attack.
[02:36:06.536 --> 02:36:11.420]  And I said at the time, I said, he is part of the Pentagon's billions in fake news.
[02:36:11.420 --> 02:36:12.501]  That's illegal.
[02:36:12.501 --> 02:36:17.725]  The General Accounting Office has already ruled that they're paying off reporters and people to go on TV.
[02:36:17.725 --> 02:36:21.207]  I said, I bet my bottom dollar, Franks is being paid off.
[02:36:21.207 --> 02:36:26.531]  Then it came out in a congressional hearing, $555,000 to make less than a dozen media appearances calling for that.
[02:36:31.445 --> 02:36:39.167]  Over a half a million bucks for Tommy Franks to go on TV and say, only thing that'll keep us safe is martial law.
[02:36:39.167 --> 02:36:42.968]  I know it sounds tough, but it's what the people want.
[02:36:42.968 --> 02:36:44.808]  When it's not what the people want.
[02:36:44.808 --> 02:36:47.949]  And folks go, I guess he's right.
[02:36:47.949 --> 02:36:49.009]  And the idea is introduced.
[02:36:49.009 --> 02:36:50.490]  I mean, I know the enemy, folks.
[02:36:50.490 --> 02:36:52.390]  I constantly study them.
[02:36:52.390 --> 02:36:54.270]  And I'm on record predicting that.
[02:36:54.270 --> 02:36:57.851]  Secret FEMA plan to use pastors and pacifiers for martial law.
[02:36:57.851 --> 02:37:00.292]  That's our article before it was declassified and made public.
[02:37:02.759 --> 02:37:04.040]  So that's part of the preparation.
[02:37:04.040 --> 02:37:07.603]  Guardsmen to conduct urban training at Arcadia in April.
[02:37:07.603 --> 02:37:09.205]  This is going on scale back now.
[02:37:09.205 --> 02:37:17.653]  It says in this article, going door-to-door asking if they can search homes looking for weapons.
[02:37:17.653 --> 02:37:20.475]  And they practice raiding the local gun shop.
[02:37:20.475 --> 02:37:22.077]  This is for domestic operations.
[02:37:23.885 --> 02:37:25.769]  Let's go ahead and get ready to play this clip.
[02:37:25.769 --> 02:37:26.770]  InfoWars story.
[02:37:26.770 --> 02:37:28.313]  We actually have a state rep coming up next hour.
[02:37:28.313 --> 02:37:29.676]  He couldn't come on right now.
[02:37:29.676 --> 02:37:34.004]  InfoWars story on a legal Tennessee checkpoint prompts action by governor.
[02:37:35.430 --> 02:37:43.939]  Friday, listeners pointed out local news saying the Army was going to be out, regular Army running checkpoints, searching citizens with police.
[02:37:43.939 --> 02:37:50.205]  The governor got called, our listeners called, and the governor said, we're not going to do this, and it got cancelled.
[02:37:50.205 --> 02:37:51.586]  This is suddenly happening everywhere.
[02:37:51.586 --> 02:37:54.149]  Oh, the Marines are doing a checkpoint for drunks.
[02:37:54.149 --> 02:37:56.751]  Oh, the Army showed up at the mass shooting.
[02:37:56.751 --> 02:37:58.873]  Oh, see, as they announce,
[02:37:59.634 --> 02:38:16.836]  that they're getting rid of posse commentatus as they announce brigade homeland as they announce troops to patrol the streets of america army times so let's go ahead and play this clip uh... from the state representative who called the governor's office uh... here it is
[02:38:19.448 --> 02:38:21.569]  Back it up and start it over.
[02:38:21.569 --> 02:38:23.389]  This was on WNWS 101.5 FM News Channel with the state rep.
[02:38:23.389 --> 02:38:24.770]  Let's give them credit.
[02:38:24.770 --> 02:38:25.190]  Start it over.
[02:38:37.697 --> 02:38:38.218]  Start it over.
[02:38:38.218 --> 02:38:40.059]  Back it up and start it over.
[02:38:40.059 --> 02:38:49.187]  The Whiteville Police Department plans to conduct a seat belt checkpoint on Saturday, April 4th at Highway 64 within the city limits of Whiteville.
[02:38:49.187 --> 02:38:57.054]  The checkpoint was planned to be in conjunction with Homeland Security and the 251st Military Police in Bolivar.
[02:38:57.054 --> 02:39:02.018]  After learning about this, I contacted Representative Johnny Shaw, who represents that area,
[02:39:02.859 --> 02:39:03.999]  Ask you about this.
[02:39:03.999 --> 02:39:09.681]  Representative Shaw, you looked into this, and can you tell me what you've learned and where this stands now?
[02:39:09.681 --> 02:39:11.002]  I can.
[02:39:11.002 --> 02:39:13.522]  Actually, this has been cancelled.
[02:39:13.522 --> 02:39:24.966]  Some calls were made to the Governor's office about this earlier today, this Friday, and of course the Governor just simply said, I don't need another headache.
[02:39:24.966 --> 02:39:28.287]  And of course it has been cancelled, and I will say that it is
[02:39:28.911 --> 02:39:30.552]  It was a bad idea in the first place.
[02:39:30.552 --> 02:39:39.377]  I mean, during this climate, in this day and time in which we live, can you imagine the army stopping you for a seatbelt check?
[02:39:39.377 --> 02:39:41.398]  So it really was a bad idea.
[02:39:41.398 --> 02:39:46.721]  I don't think it'll happen again because I think it would have frightened more people than it would have helped.
[02:39:46.721 --> 02:39:49.723]  And I'm glad the governor made that decision.
[02:39:49.723 --> 02:39:53.765]  And we will probably try to make sure this never happens again.
[02:39:54.195 --> 02:40:04.037]  We'll follow up with you on that, sir, and find out what steps are taken to protect, to see that something like this is, the public is notified in the future.
[02:40:04.037 --> 02:40:19.720]  Definitely we will, because the public should have been notified if it was going to happen, and as I said, you know, with the climate that we live in now, if you can imagine your wife, my wife, a daughter, or even son driving up on a situation like this, I mean, it could be a total panic.
[02:40:19.720 --> 02:40:22.121]  I don't know whose idea this was, if it was their idea,
[02:40:22.717 --> 02:40:34.015]  And I'm going to make sure that I call all of the local authorities and ask them not to do this anymore, but if they should even attempt to, to make sure that they contact people like myself.
[02:40:34.614 --> 02:40:38.257]  And make sure that people are notified as to what is going to happen.
[02:40:38.257 --> 02:40:39.178]  Thank you.
[02:40:39.178 --> 02:40:46.284]  Now this is being done to acclimate the public so they don't panic when troops take over the city hall, the county, the state.
[02:40:46.284 --> 02:40:59.176]  And it's in John Warren Defense Authorization Act, it's in the Pentagon Directive they recently put out last year with Brigade Homeland that the governors serve at the pleasure of the president and they are prepared to take over the legislatures.
[02:41:00.481 --> 02:41:04.662]  Just like they threatened Congress with martial law, they didn't do what the President said.
[02:41:04.662 --> 02:41:06.582]  This is high treason.
[02:41:06.582 --> 02:41:12.883]  And Obama has taken all these new powers that Bush claimed and has expanded them day one.
[02:41:12.883 --> 02:41:17.644]  And suddenly the left, that was against it, isn't saying a thing.
[02:41:17.644 --> 02:41:23.565]  Now, let's go ahead and go over these articles.
[02:41:23.565 --> 02:41:27.846]  I was just attacked by Raw Story and a bunch of other publications saying this doesn't exist.
[02:41:29.232 --> 02:41:32.375]  Brigade Homeland Tour starts October 1st.
[02:41:32.375 --> 02:41:34.096]  3rd Infantry's 1st B.C.T.
[02:41:34.096 --> 02:41:37.920]  trains for a new dwell-time mission.
[02:41:37.920 --> 02:41:41.483]  Helping people at home may become a permanent part of active army.
[02:41:41.483 --> 02:41:44.926]  And then you read this, the Washington Post reported it, everybody else did.
[02:41:44.926 --> 02:41:50.630]  It says, for riot control and civil unrest during a collapse of society.
[02:41:50.630 --> 02:41:56.095]  Then the Army War College came out a month later and said, yes, we're preparing to engage the American people and the new
[02:41:57.276 --> 02:42:07.884]  Rules of engagement, we've shown you the military training with local police to engage the American people, getting ready for martial law, getting ready for FEMA camps, all being announced!
[02:42:07.884 --> 02:42:13.027]  For decades they've been preparing this and then it accelerates right as they have the controlled implosion of the economy.
[02:42:13.996 --> 02:42:15.397]  So there's that going on.
[02:42:15.397 --> 02:42:17.860]  So they'd have troops to take you to the FEMA camps.
[02:42:17.860 --> 02:42:20.002]  Washington Post, 20,000 more U.S.
[02:42:20.002 --> 02:42:23.024]  troops to be deployed for domestic security.
[02:42:23.024 --> 02:42:26.207]  They then expanded and said, it won't be 4,000 troops, it'll be 20,000.
[02:42:26.207 --> 02:42:29.931]  And this was in December 1st, now four months ago.
[02:42:29.931 --> 02:42:33.994]  Now they're saying, oh, it'll be 40,000 regular Army troops.
[02:42:33.994 --> 02:42:38.619]  The very troops that were in Baghdad doing gun confiscation, the very best troops they've got.
[02:42:39.932 --> 02:42:41.552]  So there's the Washington Post article.
[02:42:41.552 --> 02:42:42.333]  Here's another one.
[02:42:42.333 --> 02:42:46.213]  Marines admit security force to operate inside U.S.
[02:42:46.213 --> 02:42:49.634]  This directly from the Marine Corps' own website.
[02:42:49.634 --> 02:42:53.955]  And they did it with role players practicing confiscating people's guns.
[02:42:53.955 --> 02:42:56.216]  And again, we're putting our stories up on screen.
[02:42:56.216 --> 02:43:01.637]  If you scroll down, you can link through the mainstream news articles.
[02:43:01.637 --> 02:43:03.257]  Okay, here's another one.
[02:43:03.257 --> 02:43:05.458]  Unit learned skills to fight different enemy.
[02:43:06.773 --> 02:43:10.735]  And this is out of the American Force Press Service.
[02:43:10.735 --> 02:43:13.476]  Military sets up domestic force.
[02:43:13.476 --> 02:43:16.317]  This is out of HS Today.
[02:43:16.317 --> 02:43:19.099]  HST Today.
[02:43:19.099 --> 02:43:28.463]  And Northcom receives first personnel under new plan.
[02:43:28.463 --> 02:43:31.344]  So, all of this is going on.
[02:43:31.344 --> 02:43:34.866]  Suddenly, by the way, we confirmed and got the photographs from Tennessee.
[02:43:36.275 --> 02:43:43.721]  That Army was doing this, Army got canceled, but suddenly there were Marines marching around in the towns with their guns.
[02:43:43.721 --> 02:43:45.662]  See, this is all part of acclimation.
[02:43:45.662 --> 02:43:58.593]  And then, in a four-state area in the Midwest a few months ago, there was a report about the Army suddenly locking down parts of cities and doing... and then the disgraced Governor Blagojevich announced
[02:43:59.847 --> 02:44:20.842]  about five months ago before he had that big scandal when we played the newscast here we said we're gonna have the army go door-to-door confiscating guns in Illinois and then we have the first time the army got called in New Orleans going to the high and dry areas with the police and FBI all the weapons will be taken no one will be allowed to be armed and then putting people in handcuffs that had guns taking their guns
[02:44:21.912 --> 02:44:23.212]  I mean, that's on record.
[02:44:23.212 --> 02:44:23.793]  That happened.
[02:44:23.793 --> 02:44:25.333]  This is what they're training for.
[02:44:25.333 --> 02:44:28.194]  This is what they do the first chance they get.
[02:44:28.194 --> 02:44:29.515]  Stop living in denial.
[02:44:29.515 --> 02:44:33.116]  Alright, I've gone over executive orders.
[02:44:33.116 --> 02:44:38.718]  Let's go ahead now and go over mass graves.
[02:44:38.718 --> 02:44:42.999]  This is mass graves, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:44:42.999 --> 02:44:50.542]  Now, I told you we first learned about this from the Rocky Mountain News with the executive order in Colorado.
[02:44:51.658 --> 02:44:56.463]  That built mass grave facilities and incinerators.
[02:44:56.463 --> 02:44:58.546]  It's mass graves prepared for U.S.
[02:44:58.546 --> 02:45:00.027]  citizens.
[02:45:00.027 --> 02:45:02.650]  InsideDenver.com, the Rocky Mountain News.
[02:45:02.650 --> 02:45:08.237]  Let's punch that up on screen for folks.
[02:45:08.237 --> 02:45:09.879]  Now this is the Rocky Mountain News.
[02:45:11.348 --> 02:45:23.496]  Now, we go show you mass graves, we show you all the documents of what's going on with the mass graves, and then people are in complete and total denial about that.
[02:45:23.496 --> 02:45:24.576]  Now, what does the media do?
[02:45:24.576 --> 02:45:35.483]  They focus in on something that may not be mass graves, where we're just checking into it, and then they say, well, we're expanding every federal cemetery, but that's for a large number of people dying.
[02:45:35.483 --> 02:45:36.804]  You're a conspiracy theorist.
[02:45:36.804 --> 02:45:38.004]  Hey, we have
[02:45:39.105 --> 02:45:57.778]  All these mainstream news articles about mass graves, and I just put up on screen the Rocky Mountain News, February 8, 2003, by Jim Erickson, Rocky Mountain News, State Prepares for Bioterrorism, Executive Orders Give Governor Additional Powers, Mass Graves Prepared, Incinerators.
[02:45:57.778 --> 02:45:58.419]  Okay?
[02:45:58.419 --> 02:45:58.539]  Now,
[02:45:59.741 --> 02:46:11.363]  In case any of you are wondering, this is posted up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com in a headline article, Plans for Mass Graves Confirmed, Government Surveying Cemetery Readiness for Flu Outbreak.
[02:46:11.363 --> 02:46:17.165]  We've had emergency managers on the show admitting FEMA's called them and said, we need you to get ready for millions dead.
[02:46:17.165 --> 02:46:18.005]  Okay?
[02:46:18.005 --> 02:46:20.405]  You can click on the documents, you can call the phone numbers.
[02:46:20.405 --> 02:46:23.266]  These are real documents, just like the MIAC report was real.
[02:46:25.473 --> 02:46:39.645]  And you can call, and they're asking cemeteries, this is out of New York State, all over the country, the feds are, for mass flu pandemic outbreaks to prepare them for mass graves and how many dead bodies they can bury and how fast at their facilities.
[02:46:39.645 --> 02:46:46.450]  So, all we're doing is documenting that they have mass graves and incinerators ready, and that's a fact.
[02:46:46.450 --> 02:46:50.794]  Now, people then go out and investigate, and sometimes they're right, sometimes they're wrong.
[02:46:51.701 --> 02:47:01.946]  Just like, uh, in the nineties, this FEMA camp stuff came out, and people went out and showed government facilities and said, my buddy worked in there and says they're going to use that army base under martial law.
[02:47:01.946 --> 02:47:05.308]  And then later it came out that indeed that army base is designated.
[02:47:05.308 --> 02:47:08.030]  You know, Anniston and others in Alabama.
[02:47:08.030 --> 02:47:15.494]  Then, Glenn Beck points at that and says, look, that isn't, that's just an army base, it's not a camp.
[02:47:15.494 --> 02:47:16.794]  Or, other people go show the
[02:47:18.368 --> 02:47:21.729]  Train facilities that aren't FEMA camps, officially.
[02:47:21.729 --> 02:47:23.609]  And then they say, oh, see, you're discredited.
[02:47:23.609 --> 02:47:27.930]  See, they ignore all these mountains of real evidence in the admissions.
[02:47:27.930 --> 02:47:38.573]  The government admitting they're doing this, and then always go and find some person who's wrong or mistaken, or who may be right, they just don't have total proof.
[02:47:38.573 --> 02:47:39.994]  That's how they operate there.
[02:47:39.994 --> 02:47:45.275]  So, there are the mass graves confirmed for everybody on that front.
[02:47:48.126 --> 02:47:50.269]  And I've gone over most of this.
[02:47:50.269 --> 02:47:54.834]  There's a lot of other pieces of news I haven't gotten into.
[02:47:56.651 --> 02:48:02.453]  in association with all of this, but I've shown you the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal admitting camps.
[02:48:02.453 --> 02:48:03.993]  I've shown you Senate hearings.
[02:48:03.993 --> 02:48:06.394]  I've shown you Congress threatened with martial law.
[02:48:06.394 --> 02:48:07.915]  They don't do what they're told.
[02:48:07.915 --> 02:48:11.116]  I've shown you all the documents where they're getting the states ready for martial law.
[02:48:11.116 --> 02:48:17.538]  They've reintroduced the National Compulsory Service under H.R.
[02:48:17.538 --> 02:48:17.558]  1444.
[02:48:17.558 --> 02:48:21.219]  It says for mandatory national service.
[02:48:21.219 --> 02:48:24.440]  The Defense Department announces civilian expeditionary workforce.
[02:48:26.394 --> 02:48:29.156]  in Pentagon Directive 1404.10.
[02:48:29.156 --> 02:48:32.998]  I mean, don't just sit there and say I'm making this up.
[02:48:32.998 --> 02:48:34.418]  Go to the Army's website.
[02:48:34.418 --> 02:48:35.139]  Go to the Pentagon.
[02:48:36.078 --> 02:48:44.504]  It says, management retains the authority to direct and assign civilian employees either voluntarily or involuntarily, or on an unexpected basis to accomplish D.O.D.
[02:48:44.504 --> 02:48:45.224]  mission.
[02:48:45.224 --> 02:48:50.368]  So see, they're saying they're going to create a seven million man, that was in the New York Times, the Congress said.
[02:48:50.368 --> 02:48:55.011]  I kept saying a million, because Obama said as big as our army, as big as the military.
[02:48:55.011 --> 02:48:56.332]  That'd be a million people.
[02:48:56.332 --> 02:49:04.858]  They say seven million now, and that they're going to draft you into this, and they'll decide, no more draft boards, if you stay here or if you go overseas.
[02:49:05.718 --> 02:49:10.381]  And it's 1404.10.
[02:49:10.381 --> 02:49:18.767]  Just Google Defense Department announces Civilian Expeditionary Workforce or Directive DOD.
[02:49:18.767 --> 02:49:27.053]  And it goes on, it is Section 4, Subsection E, Paragraph 2.
[02:49:27.053 --> 02:49:32.757]  So if you go to 1404.10, you go to Section 4, Subsection E, Paragraph 2.
[02:49:35.145 --> 02:49:35.945]  There you go again.
[02:49:35.945 --> 02:49:37.706]  I mean, on screen.
[02:49:37.706 --> 02:49:39.588]  Zoom in on this for me, guys.
[02:49:39.588 --> 02:49:44.270]  I mean, you can go right there to the subsection if you want to go read it for yourself.
[02:49:44.270 --> 02:49:45.991]  This is from Infowars.net.
[02:49:45.991 --> 02:49:46.772]  You can click through.
[02:49:46.772 --> 02:49:48.513]  That's a hyperlink right there.
[02:49:48.513 --> 02:49:50.034]  You'll be at the Pentagon website.
[02:49:50.034 --> 02:49:52.015]  I mean, you'll be there for yourself.
[02:49:54.636 --> 02:50:01.161]  To direct and assign civilian employees, either voluntarily or involuntarily, on an unexpected basis to accomplish the DOD mission.
[02:50:01.161 --> 02:50:04.784]  There's the headline, the Defense Department announces civilian expeditionary workforce.
[02:50:04.784 --> 02:50:06.225]  I mean, you can go read that if you'd like.
[02:50:06.225 --> 02:50:13.110]  You can read the civilian inmate labor camp program document.
[02:50:13.110 --> 02:50:16.013]  Army Regulation 210-35.
[02:50:16.013 --> 02:50:17.974]  I mean, come on, don't be lazy.
[02:50:17.974 --> 02:50:19.756]  Google it right now, you'll be at army.mil.
[02:50:21.670 --> 02:50:23.112]  I mean, you want to see the facts?
[02:50:23.112 --> 02:50:23.712]  Go right ahead.
[02:50:23.712 --> 02:50:24.273]  There it is.
[02:50:24.273 --> 02:50:26.916]  I mean, all I'm doing is researching this all day long.
[02:50:26.916 --> 02:50:28.177]  And what do I get?
[02:50:28.177 --> 02:50:35.845]  I get The Ross Story and a bunch of other magazines and newspapers saying I'm crazy.
[02:50:35.845 --> 02:50:36.325]  It says, uh...
[02:50:38.837 --> 02:50:45.482]  That the cop killer got his ideas from the off-the-wall Alex Jones prison planet saying that U.S.
[02:50:45.482 --> 02:50:53.448]  troops in homeland to engage in crowd control and they just say I'm making it up when I'm linked to the Army Times and Washington Post.
[02:50:53.448 --> 02:50:55.109]  I mean, I'm not bad here.
[02:50:55.109 --> 02:50:56.851]  I mean, it is scary.
[02:50:56.851 --> 02:50:59.753]  This is going to cause clashes between the people and the government.
[02:50:59.753 --> 02:51:01.174]  It's not my fault, it's your fault.
[02:51:01.574 --> 02:51:05.019]  Silver is mankind's oldest natural antibiotic.
[02:51:05.019 --> 02:51:09.286]  This very special mineral has been used for centuries by most cultures throughout the world.
[02:51:09.286 --> 02:51:17.258]  Utopia, Texas is home to a small but mighty supplement company called Utopia Silver, who offers colloidal products produced in distilled water,
[02:51:17.518 --> 02:51:17.938]  We're good to go!
[02:51:49.838 --> 02:51:54.521]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[02:51:54.521 --> 02:51:59.084]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well funded.
[02:52:15.197 --> 02:52:21.782]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[02:52:21.782 --> 02:52:23.764]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[02:52:23.764 --> 02:52:26.266]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[02:52:26.266 --> 02:52:37.835]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[02:52:37.835 --> 02:52:39.517]  It's not about left or right.
[02:52:39.517 --> 02:52:40.878]  It's about a one-world government.
[02:52:41.374 --> 02:52:48.277]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[02:52:56.541 --> 02:52:58.101]  The Obama Deception.
[02:52:58.101 --> 02:52:59.302]  The people strike back.
[02:53:01.206 --> 02:53:03.689]  Hi, this is Peter Kronschnabel with Midas Resources.
[02:53:03.689 --> 02:53:07.494]  As you know, government spending is at an all-time high and inflation is on the rise.
[02:53:07.494 --> 02:53:10.298]  What are you doing right now to protect yourself financially?
[02:53:10.298 --> 02:53:17.488]  As the economy continues to deteriorate due to corporate greed and government intervention, more people will lose their jobs and worse, their life savings.
[02:53:17.628 --> 02:53:17.948]  I'm good.
[02:53:34.096 --> 02:53:38.237]  If you've been thinking about investing in the physical possession of precious metals, I can help.
[02:53:38.237 --> 02:53:44.039]  Call me today, Peter Kranchnobel, at 800-686-2237, extension 108.
[02:53:44.039 --> 02:53:49.081]  And I will take the time personally to put together a portfolio designed to protect what you've worked so hard for.
[02:53:49.081 --> 02:53:53.543]  Call Peter, 800-686-2237, extension 108.
[02:53:53.543 --> 02:53:56.184]  You've worked hard your whole life, and I want to work hard for you.
[02:53:56.184 --> 02:53:56.664]  Call 800-686-2237, extension 108.
[02:54:15.333 --> 02:54:24.641]  Alright, at the 8 after we got Max Keiser for the final hour and we have a state rep who called the governor and wouldn't let the army run warrantless checkpoints.
[02:54:24.641 --> 02:54:31.846]  Cops doing that's illegal, but see now it's the army's here to search the citizens with Homeland Security.
[02:54:31.846 --> 02:54:33.548]  That's outside the Fed's jurisdiction.
[02:54:34.798 --> 02:54:38.561]  See, they won't control the borders, but they're going to control you, the milk cows.
[02:54:38.561 --> 02:54:44.125]  Throughout history, criminals get control of governments, they use phony crises to enslave the public.
[02:54:44.125 --> 02:54:56.414]  And they're taking your pension funds, they're taking your money, they're raising the taxes on you, they are going to squeeze the daylights out of us all, and that's why they're geared up for martial law and to take the media over, because this is quite a gamble by the establishment.
[02:54:56.954 --> 02:55:06.916]  You know, we should have grand juries indicting the bankers and having them turn state's evidence against each other and this whole criminal shadow government national security state should be exposed.
[02:55:06.916 --> 02:55:17.338]  Instead, it's acting all legitimate and it's going to manage the financial crisis and it's going to manage everything it's engineered and bring in total tyranny and start arresting people for their speech.
[02:55:17.338 --> 02:55:20.158]  So it either goes into tyranny or into liberty.
[02:55:20.158 --> 02:55:25.059]  And believe me folks, liberty is probably where it's going because this tyranny is so horrible they've got planned.
[02:55:26.138 --> 02:55:30.403]  You know, nine times out of ten, lunatic tyrants try to take over and fail.
[02:55:30.403 --> 02:55:35.428]  It's just that another tyrant comes, and another tyrant comes, so in the end, they always win.
[02:55:35.428 --> 02:55:37.371]  Every nation falls to tyranny.
[02:55:37.371 --> 02:55:39.994]  No nation's ever survived as long as the United States.
[02:55:39.994 --> 02:55:41.055]  Rome fell in about 230 years.
[02:55:41.055 --> 02:55:42.316]  We're 236 years old right now, folks.
[02:55:42.316 --> 02:55:42.697]  We're due to fall.
[02:55:47.051 --> 02:55:48.832]  And frankly, we've already fallen.
[02:55:48.832 --> 02:55:49.752]  Can we get it back?
[02:55:49.752 --> 02:55:52.314]  You know, the globalists have grabbed the republic in their jaws.
[02:55:52.314 --> 02:55:53.594]  Can we grab it back?
[02:55:53.594 --> 02:55:57.837]  Or will we let the bulldog of the new world order convince us that it's his to eat?
[02:55:57.837 --> 02:56:02.379]  You know, that he can go ahead and gobble it all down into his greedy belly.
[02:56:02.379 --> 02:56:04.460]  So that's when I say to all of you, this is history.
[02:56:04.460 --> 02:56:04.940]  It's happening.
[02:56:04.940 --> 02:56:07.742]  They're openly announcing bank of the world, world government.
[02:56:08.564 --> 02:56:15.147]  They're openly announcing that we'll pay our taxes to a new bank of the world and that it's a world government and global governance.
[02:56:15.147 --> 02:56:17.668]  Google global governance in Google News.
[02:56:17.668 --> 02:56:20.869]  Hundreds of mainstream articles saying global governance, global governance.
[02:56:20.869 --> 02:56:25.331]  Governance means government.
[02:56:25.331 --> 02:56:26.732]  It's everywhere!
[02:56:26.732 --> 02:56:27.993]  New global currency.
[02:56:27.993 --> 02:56:30.934]  It's all happening by the very criminals that have engineered this.
[02:56:32.150 --> 02:56:38.394]  And if they can get the sleight of hand done, if they can get the hidden in plain view completed, if they can engage in this heist, then they win!
[02:56:38.394 --> 02:56:40.174]  And get a world empire!
[02:56:40.174 --> 02:56:40.835]  The first ever!
[02:56:40.835 --> 02:56:47.178]  But if we say, wait a minute, what you're doing is criminal, what you're doing is illegal, what you're doing is out of control.
[02:56:47.178 --> 02:56:48.039]  They fall.
[02:56:48.039 --> 02:56:48.879]  They fail.
[02:56:48.879 --> 02:56:49.820]  We get our country back.
[02:56:51.397 --> 02:57:02.466]  But if they can play the police and military and the public off against each other, if they can get a shooting war started, if they can convince the cops to go for the guns, it's going to be a total implosion of our society and then they win.
[02:57:02.466 --> 02:57:04.888]  We want to stop that and stop that now.
[02:57:04.888 --> 02:57:18.880]  And that's why it's important to expose the military takeover, the FEMA camps, the mass graves, all of it, because this agenda, this internet media takeover, Barack Obama taking over the web, this is all happening and it's bipartisan.
[02:57:18.880 --> 02:57:20.021]  In closing for this hour,
[02:57:21.317 --> 02:57:23.539]  I want to encourage all of you, the listeners.
[02:57:23.539 --> 02:57:25.801]  I've just done three hours of radio.
[02:57:25.801 --> 02:57:27.442]  Do you know what funds this operation?
[02:57:27.442 --> 02:57:28.764]  What makes this all possible?
[02:57:28.764 --> 02:57:30.625]  You buying the books and videos.
[02:57:30.625 --> 02:57:32.447]  My new film, The Obama Deception, is out.
[02:57:32.447 --> 02:57:39.273]  It covers the martial law, the FEMA camps, the youth brigades, that Obama's a puppet, what the bankers are doing, their master plan.
[02:57:39.273 --> 02:57:41.295]  If America sees this, they won't
[02:57:42.597 --> 02:57:44.178]  Be suckered into what's happening.
[02:57:44.178 --> 02:57:46.498]  We can win this thing if we take action.
[02:57:46.498 --> 02:57:48.699]  Get the DVD at InfoWars.com.
[02:57:48.699 --> 02:57:53.541]  Make copies of it like your life depends on it, like your future does, because frankly it does.
[02:57:53.541 --> 02:58:01.304]  Get the DVD at InfoWars.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[02:58:01.304 --> 02:58:02.804]  Stop procrastinating.
[02:58:02.804 --> 02:58:06.726]  If thousands of you will get the film and make thousands of copies apiece, yes it's a big job.
[02:58:07.537 --> 02:58:13.038]  If you'll get a PrisonPlanet.tv membership and burn copies of it to DivX and get it out, it's unstoppable.
[02:58:13.038 --> 02:58:17.480]  If you'll get the free YouTube copy, it's at the bottom of InfoWars.com and get it out.
[02:58:17.480 --> 02:58:19.300]  Millions and millions of views.
[02:58:19.300 --> 02:58:20.780]  We can defeat these bastards.
[02:58:20.780 --> 02:58:26.522]  That's why I'm under attack from operatives in the movement, high-level media, everybody, because
[02:58:27.402 --> 02:58:30.325]  I am going in, through, and beyond the New World Order.
[02:58:30.325 --> 02:58:32.388]  I am committed, and there's no turning back.
[02:58:32.388 --> 02:58:43.299]  So get the ObamaDeceptionInfoWars.com or call toll free 888-253-3139 back in 70 seconds.
[02:58:43.299 --> 02:58:45.922]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:58:45.922 --> 02:58:49.046]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:58:51.380 --> 02:58:53.062]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[02:58:53.062 --> 02:58:57.808]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[02:58:57.808 --> 02:59:00.772]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[02:59:00.772 --> 02:59:03.816]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[02:59:03.816 --> 02:59:09.664]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency if you simply prepare.
[02:59:09.884 --> 02:59:13.126]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[02:59:13.126 --> 02:59:20.111]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[02:59:20.111 --> 02:59:23.393]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[02:59:23.393 --> 02:59:25.274]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or on the web go to eFoodsDirect.com.
[02:59:28.536 --> 02:59:34.801]  Visit eFoodsDirect.com and look over the fine list of high-quality, prescribed, and dehydrated foods they have to offer.
[02:59:34.801 --> 02:59:38.565]  Watch the free videos, look at their online catalog, or give them a call at 1-800-409-5633.
[02:59:38.565 --> 02:59:40.106]  Again, 800-409-5633, or on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[02:59:40.106 --> 02:59:40.546]  Take action today.
[02:59:40.546 --> 02:59:42.368]  The first step is getting storable food.
[02:59:54.221 --> 02:59:56.602]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:59:56.602 --> 03:00:08.447]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[03:00:08.447 --> 03:00:18.212]  Well, that's basically it for my hour and thirty minute expose on the FEMA camps, the whole mechanism of shadow government, and the takeover of our society.
[03:00:18.212 --> 03:00:18.892]  In closing,
[03:00:20.171 --> 03:00:33.858]  I would ask listeners to rip this video off of PrisonPlanet.tv, where our members are watching it in high quality live right now, or archived, post it to YouTube, and make sure it goes mega viral.
[03:00:33.858 --> 03:00:44.663]  The camps are real, the mass graves are real, the whole mechanism of martial law and shadow government takeover and tyranny is real and is the norm in human history.
[03:00:45.999 --> 03:00:48.900]  Liberty and freedom is incredibly rare and precious.
[03:00:48.900 --> 03:00:55.463]  And if the American people don't wake up, that it can and is happening here, the tyranny is happening here, it's going to succeed.
[03:00:55.463 --> 03:01:03.406]  You know, in the end it will fall and fail, but I don't want it to end up like China or Russia or Germany, you know, where we have to go through that first.
[03:01:03.406 --> 03:01:09.768]  But, you know, regardless, we're going to fight this thing and the fact that we're here fighting them before it all happens means that as we go into it,
[03:01:10.308 --> 03:01:16.334]  We'll have that much more of a fighting chance against it, because folks will finally remember that we warned them and that it actually came true.
[03:01:16.334 --> 03:01:19.777]  That's the biggest thing we've got on our side, is that we saw it historically.
[03:01:19.777 --> 03:01:23.981]  We knew that those that, you know, don't know history are doomed to repeat it.
[03:01:23.981 --> 03:01:30.607]  So we warned people, we were repeating history, and now that may be why we've got a fighting chance.
[03:01:30.607 --> 03:01:35.792]  So again, get this video out to everybody, get this audio out to everybody that we've just done this presentation.
[03:01:38.726 --> 03:01:43.629]  Now, speaking of information, I want to tell you about a few of the sponsors that make this show possible.
[03:01:43.629 --> 03:01:49.293]  The Max Keiser's coming up, and then, briefly, a state rep on kicking the military out of Tennessee running checkpoints.
[03:01:49.293 --> 03:01:50.273]  I mean, it's happening.
[03:01:50.273 --> 03:01:53.055]  They're just probing, probing, probing, probing.
[03:01:53.055 --> 03:01:54.936]  Can we do local gun confiscation drills?
[03:01:54.936 --> 03:01:57.318]  Can we run checkpoints on the highway?
[03:01:57.318 --> 03:01:58.519]  They're probing, probing.
[03:02:00.000 --> 03:02:00.801]  Home Gain.
[03:02:00.801 --> 03:02:05.464]  Let me tell you a little bit about one of our great sponsors, HomeGain.com.
[03:02:05.464 --> 03:02:11.007]  This is the place to get you started buying or selling a home, finding a realtor and getting any real estate questions answered.
[03:02:11.007 --> 03:02:14.290]  Go to H-O-M-E-G-A-I-N.com.
[03:02:14.290 --> 03:02:20.414]  All you need to do is type in their home address and you'll get an instant free estimate of your home value online.
[03:02:20.414 --> 03:02:22.175]  It's a great way to monitor the value of your home.
[03:02:22.175 --> 03:02:29.460]  You can also check and see what the best market improvements are on the upkeep of your home or to add-ons or any type of
[03:02:30.501 --> 03:02:30.901]  We're good to go.
[03:02:49.008 --> 03:02:53.112]  So we don't have to remind you that you need food to survive.
[03:02:53.112 --> 03:02:58.738]  Our biggest sponsors, eFoods Direct, is the longest-running operating affordable foods company in the country.
[03:02:58.738 --> 03:03:03.583]  They also happen to be true patriots and have supported the Freedom Movement for many, many years.
[03:03:03.583 --> 03:03:10.090]  They have non-GMO, non-hybrid, high-quality food at the very lowest prices that was just produced, just made, lasts more than 15 years.
[03:03:11.791 --> 03:03:17.156]  More than 10 years in climate control, as much as 20 they say, but guaranteed for 10 years in non-climate controlled.
[03:03:17.156 --> 03:03:30.286]  Give them a call at 1-800-409-5633, 1-800-409-5633, or visit their website at efoodsdirect.com, big banners up on infowars.com, and prisonplanet.com.
[03:03:30.286 --> 03:03:35.590]  Another one of the sponsors that makes this show possible, and I believe in all these sponsors, is pepperspray.com.
[03:03:36.397 --> 03:03:40.261]  We live in an unpredictable world, and as everyone knows, I'm all about preparedness.
[03:03:40.261 --> 03:03:43.044]  Remember, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.
[03:03:43.044 --> 03:03:50.812]  That's why I want you to visit our new sponsor, Pepperspray.com, to check out their wide variety of personal security products they have available on their website.
[03:03:50.812 --> 03:03:55.837]  Since 1994, Pepperspray.com has made your personal safety their number one priority.
[03:03:55.837 --> 03:03:56.798]  So give them a call at 1-800-908-9988.
[03:03:59.361 --> 03:04:06.945]  Again, that number is 1-800-908-9988 or visit them at Pepperspray.com and give yourself some peace of mind.
[03:04:06.945 --> 03:04:11.507]  On the web since 94, sell a wide variety of personal safety and security products.
[03:04:11.507 --> 03:04:14.889]  You're not only getting security but peace of mind you deserve as well.
[03:04:14.889 --> 03:04:17.490]  Free shipping on orders above $99.
[03:04:17.490 --> 03:04:19.291]  Pepperspray of all kinds and strengths.
[03:04:19.291 --> 03:04:23.953]  Stun guns and tasers, animal repellents, home safety, personal alarms and much more.
[03:04:23.953 --> 03:04:24.593]  Pepperspray.com.
[03:04:26.667 --> 03:04:38.693]  I know I just plugged three sponsors there, but I did three hours and didn't plug one sponsor, and so I'm condensing it all here as we start the final hour, but I'm very, very thankful to those sponsors that I just mentioned for making this show possible.
[03:04:38.693 --> 03:04:40.995]  I'm also very thankful to our AM and FM affiliates.
[03:04:40.995 --> 03:04:55.042]  Be sure and support their local sponsors, and I'm very, very thankful to all of you that continue to spread the word about the show and about the free podcast being downloaded by over 130,000 people a day at InfoWars.com on the Listen page.
[03:04:55.042 --> 03:04:56.103]  We'll be right back with Max
[03:04:58.183 --> 03:05:02.945]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[03:05:02.945 --> 03:05:08.526]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[03:05:08.526 --> 03:05:13.548]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[03:05:13.548 --> 03:05:19.129]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[03:05:19.129 --> 03:05:24.350]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[03:05:24.350 --> 03:05:26.211]  They call it a survival seed bank.
[03:05:26.656 --> 03:05:31.460]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[03:05:31.460 --> 03:05:32.561]  And here's the best part.
[03:05:32.561 --> 03:05:35.343]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[03:05:35.343 --> 03:05:39.266]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.

[03:05:45.771 --> 03:05:46.932]  Remember, in a real crisis,
[03:05:55.768 --> 03:05:58.311]  Non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[03:05:58.311 --> 03:06:02.055]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[03:06:02.055 --> 03:06:07.861]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[03:06:07.861 --> 03:06:14.848]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[03:06:15.436 --> 03:06:22.023]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[03:06:22.023 --> 03:06:24.005]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[03:06:24.005 --> 03:06:26.507]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[03:06:26.507 --> 03:06:37.479]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[03:06:38.067 --> 03:06:39.748]  It's not about left or right.
[03:06:39.748 --> 03:06:41.588]  It's about a one world government.
[03:06:41.588 --> 03:06:48.511]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[03:06:56.774 --> 03:06:58.335]  The Obama Deception.
[03:06:58.335 --> 03:07:01.596]  The people strike back.
[03:07:01.596 --> 03:07:04.177]  Companies continue to lay off thousands of people.
[03:07:04.818 --> 03:07:08.141]  Unemployment is the highest it's been in over 30 years.
[03:07:08.141 --> 03:07:11.924]  Statistics prove that in a recession, crime rates go up.
[03:07:11.924 --> 03:07:18.510]  Everyone needs something for that extra edge to prevent becoming a victim in these difficult and trying times.
[03:07:18.510 --> 03:07:23.734]  You need to prepare yourself with DPS pepper spray, available at MrDefense.com.
[03:07:23.734 --> 03:07:30.440]  DPS is the strongest pepper spray in the market and is the same spray used by hundreds of law enforcement agencies from around the world.

[03:07:53.682 --> 03:07:56.185]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[03:07:56.185 --> 03:07:57.346]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[03:08:17.831 --> 03:08:23.095]  Well, we've got a really neat guest on for the next 52 minutes.
[03:08:23.095 --> 03:08:24.076]  That's Max Keiser.
[03:08:24.076 --> 03:08:29.040]  The website's maxkeiser.com.
[03:08:29.040 --> 03:08:33.784]  He's a filmmaker, broadcaster, former broker and options trader.
[03:08:33.784 --> 03:08:37.246]  He hosts the Oracle with Max Keiser on BBC World News.
[03:08:37.246 --> 03:08:42.631]  Previously, he produced and appeared regularly in TV series People and Power on Al Jazeera English Network.
[03:08:42.631 --> 03:08:46.314]  Max also presents a weekly radio show about finance and markets on London's
[03:08:46.894 --> 03:08:48.276]  Resonance FM.
[03:08:48.276 --> 03:08:50.018]  Max also writes for the Huffington Post.
[03:08:50.018 --> 03:08:57.887]  In addition to his broadcasting work, Kaiser is known for his invention of virtual specialist technology that revolutionized a lot of what you see today.
[03:08:57.887 --> 03:09:00.930]  A software system used by the Hollywood Stock Exchange.
[03:09:00.930 --> 03:09:02.012]  Virtual trading system.
[03:09:02.012 --> 03:09:06.637]  Kaiser has also been described as the Michael Moore of Wall Street, both for his controversial
[03:09:07.738 --> 03:09:14.804]  Confrontational, humorous delivery, and because his character and his critics consider him a sensationalist left-winger.
[03:09:14.804 --> 03:09:22.529]  I wouldn't call him a left-winger because I certainly agree with a lot of his views about the corrupt globalists and the banks, and we've got him here to talk about a host of issues.
[03:09:22.529 --> 03:09:36.160]  He's gotten a lot of attention and being linked up on the Drudge Report, talking about how the U.S.-British-backed banks will invade a country if they try to move to another currency or another form of world monetary unit.
[03:09:37.196 --> 03:09:37.616]  Alex Jones!
[03:09:37.616 --> 03:09:38.057]  Alex Jones!
[03:09:38.057 --> 03:09:38.277]  Alex Jones!
[03:10:04.289 --> 03:10:06.470]  Okay, Max Keiser, so much is going on.
[03:10:06.470 --> 03:10:08.150]  Now, let's talk about the G20.
[03:10:08.150 --> 03:10:10.891]  They're trying to push for a new global monetary bank.
[03:10:10.891 --> 03:10:12.971]  The same bankers that engineered the crisis.
[03:10:12.971 --> 03:10:16.412]  They're going to save us by giving them more power.
[03:10:16.412 --> 03:10:25.794]  Yeah, well, I'll tell you what, before we get to the G20, I thought I'd review for you the orchestration of the biggest wealth heist in history.
[03:10:25.794 --> 03:10:27.174]  Okay, you ready for this?
[03:10:27.174 --> 03:10:32.756]  In two or three minutes, I will relate to you about how the biggest wealth heist in history took place.
[03:10:32.756 --> 03:10:33.796]  Are you ready for this?
[03:10:36.483 --> 03:10:42.785]  Basically, going back to the 9-11 attacks.
[03:10:42.785 --> 03:10:53.148]  At that moment, Alex, the rich people in America got really frightened because their notion was, oh my god, the barbarians are here!
[03:10:53.148 --> 03:10:55.149]  What are we going to do?
[03:10:55.149 --> 03:10:59.930]  And Alan Greenspan, at the Federal Reserve Bank at the time, he took interest rates down to 1%.
[03:10:59.930 --> 03:11:00.991]  Now, interest rates
[03:11:03.312 --> 03:11:06.935]  ...are the fulcrum upon which the entire U.S.
[03:11:06.935 --> 03:11:10.338]  economy and the global economy function.
[03:11:10.338 --> 03:11:11.759]  Low rates versus high rates.
[03:11:11.759 --> 03:11:20.686]  This is the tension that we've seen in America going all the way back to, oh, you know, you could say when they introduced the Federal Reserve back in the 1913 era.
[03:11:20.686 --> 03:11:22.727]  But it's interest rates that are the key.
[03:11:22.727 --> 03:11:31.194]  Now, when Greenspan lowered interest rates down to 1% after the attacks of 9-11, at the behest of the, what you might call, the elites in America,
[03:11:31.775 --> 03:11:39.378]  Because when you have low interest rates like that, you can engineer incredible banking frauds and heists.
[03:11:39.378 --> 03:11:53.383]  And what we've seen since that time is the banking system first accumulate hundreds of billions, if not trillions of dollars, of what we now call, or what we now know, are counterfeit bonds, stocks, and options.
[03:11:53.383 --> 03:11:58.825]  To the point where even Gordon Brown, at the G20 meeting, referred to this whole system
[03:11:59.249 --> 03:11:59.649]  We're good to go.
[03:12:22.283 --> 03:12:27.327]  $10, $12 trillion into these banks, it doesn't seem to improve the situation at all.
[03:12:27.327 --> 03:12:32.011]  Because they're sitting on $20, $30, $40 trillion of fraudulent trade.
[03:12:32.011 --> 03:12:35.433]  And this has all been building up since the 9-11 attacks.
[03:12:35.433 --> 03:12:41.298]  They artificially dropped interest rates down to 1%, which set in motion the dot-com bubble.
[03:12:41.298 --> 03:12:47.622]  When then that burst, but instead of there being a recession, it merely went into the real estate bubble.
[03:12:47.622 --> 03:12:50.564]  That built up to extraordinary levels.
[03:12:50.564 --> 03:12:51.225]  When that burst,
[03:12:51.781 --> 03:12:58.847]  Now they're faced with how are we going to create a new bubble, and a new bubble is what we talked about at the G20.
[03:12:58.847 --> 03:13:12.079]  It's Gordon Brown, he's talking about the IMF, he's talking about a global currency, and this is how they're going to try to hide this 20 or 30 trillion or more in bogus counterfeit bonds and stocks by using now the IMF.
[03:13:12.079 --> 03:13:15.782]  The IMF is not going to be the new global slush fund of choice.
[03:13:16.676 --> 03:13:18.597]  And that's what we're seeing today.
[03:13:18.597 --> 03:13:20.898]  What does it mean to people on the street?
[03:13:20.898 --> 03:13:22.358]  To average Americans?
[03:13:22.358 --> 03:13:40.525]  It means that they're not going to have money to borrow, it means the recession is going to get deeper, it means there's a depression coming, and it means that the bankers who have been basically using the system to confiscate all of this wealth are just getting better at it, and they're not about to turn around and start sharing
[03:13:41.204 --> 03:13:41.705]  That's right.
[03:14:00.700 --> 03:14:06.486]  They can continue to put forth these are incredible accounting frauds.
[03:14:06.486 --> 03:14:16.996]  Max Keiser, just to simplify it for people, Bloomberg now reports $12.8 trillion has disappeared in six months, since October 3rd, into a black hole.
[03:14:16.996 --> 03:14:20.660]  Senators and House members asked the Fed Chief, where's the money?
[03:14:20.660 --> 03:14:22.001]  He says, I won't tell you.
[03:14:22.882 --> 03:14:26.285]  Meanwhile, they're still giving each other record bonuses.
[03:14:26.285 --> 03:14:27.826]  Rome is beginning to burn.
[03:14:27.826 --> 03:14:33.570]  630-something thousand people unemployed in March alone.
[03:14:33.570 --> 03:14:36.672]  Accelerating.
[03:14:36.672 --> 03:14:39.354]  All of this is just getting crazier and crazier.
[03:14:39.354 --> 03:14:48.040]  Meanwhile, the very banking institutions that engage in this Ponzi scheme, this counterfeiting fraud, as you rightfully put it, are running around smiling at the G20.
[03:14:49.301 --> 03:14:51.522]  Saying that they're saving us.
[03:14:51.522 --> 03:14:53.643]  I mean, where does all this go?
[03:14:53.643 --> 03:14:56.284]  I mean, how bad?
[03:14:56.284 --> 03:15:06.828]  The black hole, or the shadow banking system, is still quite in several magnitudes greater than this $11 to $12 trillion that they've already dumped into the system.
[03:15:06.828 --> 03:15:10.549]  And we're talking about multiple hundreds of trillions of dollars.
[03:15:10.549 --> 03:15:12.570]  And because it's a show game.
[03:15:13.835 --> 03:15:18.276]  So, they, as you know, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan stopped being investment banks.
[03:15:18.276 --> 03:15:19.556]  They became commercial banks.
[03:15:19.556 --> 03:15:22.217]  That allowed them to be eligible for bailout money from the Fed.
[03:15:22.217 --> 03:15:24.777]  Then they bought a dying institution like Merrill Lynch.
[03:15:24.777 --> 03:15:28.978]  It was bought by Bank of America, so they can get money from the Fed to bail them out.
[03:15:28.978 --> 03:15:32.819]  Merrill Lynch is still sitting on a huge, multi-trillion black hole of debt.
[03:15:32.819 --> 03:15:40.520]  JPMorgan alone has $90 trillion worth of derivative contracts, and they won't tell you where they are or who the counterparty is.
[03:15:41.209 --> 03:15:44.029]  You know, that's another phrase you hear all the time.
[03:15:44.029 --> 03:15:44.950]  Oh, the counter-party.
[03:15:44.950 --> 03:15:46.130]  Are they at risk?
[03:15:46.130 --> 03:15:46.630]  Or not at risk?
[03:15:46.630 --> 03:15:48.850]  Well, the ultimate counter-party is you and me.
[03:15:48.850 --> 03:15:50.111]  We're the counter-party.
[03:15:50.111 --> 03:15:51.691]  And let's be clear, let's be clear.
[03:15:51.691 --> 03:15:52.371]  No counter-party?
[03:15:52.371 --> 03:15:55.011]  Well, we're the counter-party ultimately at the end of the game.
[03:15:55.011 --> 03:15:56.312]  And how do they do that?
[03:15:56.312 --> 03:16:05.373]  Well, the end game is, as many people on your show have pointed out, massive money printing, hyper, you know, high inflation, hyperinflation.
[03:16:05.373 --> 03:16:08.334]  So that's really when the true crisis begins.
[03:16:08.334 --> 03:16:09.774]  So when Obama says that, well,
[03:16:10.478 --> 03:16:14.261]  You know, we're learning our lessons now, and we don't want to repeat this crisis.
[03:16:14.261 --> 03:16:16.243]  We haven't even started the real crisis yet.
[03:16:16.243 --> 03:16:21.708]  The real crisis is when all this money finds its way into the general economy in the form of hyperinflation.
[03:16:21.708 --> 03:16:22.149]  The U.S.
[03:16:22.149 --> 03:16:27.874]  policies right now are the policies not of the 30's that they're trying to avoid, but of Weimar Republic of the 20's.
[03:16:27.874 --> 03:16:35.541]  Weimar Republic, to recover from World War I, introduced lower rates, high money supply, and basically the same policies that the U.S.
[03:16:35.541 --> 03:16:36.261]  are doing now.
[03:16:36.261 --> 03:16:36.962]  The result was
[03:16:37.580 --> 03:16:39.201]  Hyperinflation in Weimar Germany.
[03:16:39.201 --> 03:16:40.362]  History tells us this.
[03:16:40.362 --> 03:16:42.003]  This is what is going to happen in the U.S.
[03:16:42.003 --> 03:16:45.045]  because they're doing the exact same policies.
[03:16:45.045 --> 03:16:52.650]  Now Max Keiser, expanding on that, and you've been making these predictions for years, and now unfortunately they're coming true.
[03:16:52.650 --> 03:16:57.353]  Five years ago you were criticizing the derivative situation and calling it a Ponzi scheme.
[03:16:57.353 --> 03:16:58.474]  Now we're at that point.
[03:16:58.474 --> 03:17:00.895]  $12.8 trillion they expect U.S.
[03:17:00.895 --> 03:17:03.217]  taxpayers to pay back to offshore banks.
[03:17:04.338 --> 03:17:11.842]  And then in a weird way the central banks then get paid interest on allowing the government to loan money to the very banks.
[03:17:11.842 --> 03:17:19.026]  So they're going to get interest on the money we basically give them and then charge us interest and the GDP is $13 trillion.
[03:17:22.245 --> 03:17:29.412]  of the United States and all these other countries are getting close to exceeding their GDPs in only six months of looting.
[03:17:29.412 --> 03:17:33.876]  So, A, how would we ever pay back to the foreign banks?
[03:17:33.876 --> 03:17:36.959]  We have to pay them back for giving them our money.
[03:17:36.959 --> 03:17:38.420]  Get your mind around that, folks.
[03:17:38.420 --> 03:17:42.204]  Will we be able to ever pay them back with a million new taxes?
[03:17:42.204 --> 03:17:47.209]  And then, B, how bad will the hyperinflation crises get and when is that coming?
[03:17:48.049 --> 03:17:59.433]  Well, the interest that Americans on average pay, the percentage of their income that goes to servicing the debt, is in the, I believe in the 14 to 15 percent.
[03:17:59.433 --> 03:18:00.813]  I'll double check my figures.
[03:18:00.813 --> 03:18:05.955]  I know that it's up quite sharply in the last year, year and a half.
[03:18:05.955 --> 03:18:09.576]  And the trajectory of that number is going up quite quickly.
[03:18:09.576 --> 03:18:13.998]  So when the income of you and me and every American
[03:18:14.562 --> 03:18:25.246]  When it gets to the point where you're putting 50 or 60 or 70 percent of your income to pay just the interest on your debt, then you have what Warren Buffett himself predicted less than three years ago.
[03:18:25.246 --> 03:18:34.469]  Warren Buffett himself said America is becoming a nation of sharecroppers.
[03:18:34.469 --> 03:18:35.249]  And that's what we're talking about.
[03:18:35.249 --> 03:18:39.891]  We're talking about indentured servitude, and it's being engineered because
[03:18:41.022 --> 03:18:42.362]  You know, the rich people.
[03:18:42.362 --> 03:18:44.343]  You've got to go all the way back to 1649, Alex.
[03:18:44.343 --> 03:18:49.284]  You know, in England they revolted against the divine right of king.
[03:18:49.284 --> 03:18:57.805]  Charles I was taken off the throne and he had a parliamentary rule established and it was the end of the divine right of king.
[03:18:57.805 --> 03:19:00.186]  Now we've got the divine right of hedge funds.
[03:19:00.186 --> 03:19:02.226]  The hedge funds think that they're God.
[03:19:02.226 --> 03:19:09.968]  They think Tim Geithner thinks he's God and that he farts money and he wants everyone to breathe in his fart money and think that that can sustain them.
[03:19:13.777 --> 03:19:17.939]  Let me give an example of something that's absolutely shocking.
[03:19:17.939 --> 03:19:23.641]  Just recently, the government went after UBS, Union Bank of Switzerland, and they said, you know what?
[03:19:23.641 --> 03:19:27.842]  We found you evading taxes and helping people to evade taxes.
[03:19:27.842 --> 03:19:29.843]  We're going to fine you $750 million.
[03:19:29.843 --> 03:19:36.665]  At the same time, AIG, through Geiger's plan, was getting a $5 billion cash injection from the U.S.
[03:19:36.665 --> 03:19:40.446]  taxpayer that went right into UBS's pocket.
[03:19:40.446 --> 03:19:42.047]  So the penalty that UBS had to pay
[03:19:42.523 --> 03:19:47.466]  for being caught in a tax evasion scam was to be gifted from the U.S.
[03:19:47.466 --> 03:19:50.288]  taxpayer $4.25 billion.
[03:19:50.288 --> 03:19:50.909]  Stay there, Max.
[03:19:50.909 --> 03:19:52.910]  I'm going to repeat that when we come back.
[03:19:52.910 --> 03:19:59.795]  Max Keiser is our guest, and we're going to continue breaking all this down and talk about the big issue.
[03:19:59.795 --> 03:20:01.136]  How about we just arrest the bankers?
[03:20:02.188 --> 03:20:04.909]  This year millions of people will lose electricity.
[03:20:04.909 --> 03:20:09.372]  Ice storms, earthquakes, flooding or hurricanes could leave you without power for days.
[03:20:09.372 --> 03:20:13.674]  Anyone that's ever been in a blackout knows that the first thing you need is a flashlight.
[03:20:13.674 --> 03:20:15.855]  That's why you need the Paclite.
[03:20:15.855 --> 03:20:20.658]  The Paclite is powered by a 9-volt battery and lasts up to 1,200 hours.
[03:20:20.658 --> 03:20:27.561]  It's so small it fits right in your pocket and glows in the dark, making it easy to find when you need it most.
[03:20:27.561 --> 03:20:28.762]  One Florida customer says,
[03:20:29.227 --> 03:20:37.829]  My Paclite has lasted through 4 hurricanes in 2 years, over 30 days without electricity, and I'm still using the same battery.
[03:20:37.829 --> 03:20:42.470]  The Paclite comes with a 25 year warranty and prices start at just $12.99.
[03:20:42.470 --> 03:20:45.810]  It's time for you to be prepared with a Paclite.
[03:20:45.810 --> 03:20:52.432]  Visit us at 9voltlite.com, that's 9voltlite.com, or call us today toll free at 877-715-4448, that's 877-715-4448.
[03:20:59.494 --> 03:21:07.365]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[03:21:08.158 --> 03:21:14.043]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[03:21:14.043 --> 03:21:20.548]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[03:21:20.548 --> 03:21:22.530]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[03:21:22.530 --> 03:21:24.992]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[03:21:24.992 --> 03:21:35.881]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[03:21:38.166 --> 03:21:39.826]  It's not about left or right.
[03:21:39.826 --> 03:21:41.687]  It's about a one world government.
[03:21:41.687 --> 03:21:48.588]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[03:21:48.588 --> 03:21:56.850]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:21:56.850 --> 03:21:58.431]  The Obama Deception.
[03:21:58.431 --> 03:21:59.631]  The people strike back.
[03:22:01.730 --> 03:22:02.331]  Good day.
[03:22:02.331 --> 03:22:04.093]  Jim Newcomer from Minus Resources.
[03:22:04.093 --> 03:22:05.595]  April 6, 2009.
[03:22:05.595 --> 03:22:07.458]  Gold opened this morning at $877.30.
[03:22:07.458 --> 03:22:11.723]  A one-ounce gold coin can be purchased for $903.01, $451.50 for a half-ounce, and $225.75 for the quarter-ounce.
[03:22:11.723 --> 03:22:12.364]  That's $903.01, $451.50, and $225.75.
[03:22:20.299 --> 03:22:33.946]  How is it that we the people grow the cotton, weave it into fabric, engrave the ink, embed the strips and fibers that protect it from counterfeit, then cart the money off to a privately owned bank to have it lent back to us at interest, forcing us to pay taxes to service the debt?
[03:22:33.946 --> 03:22:35.187]  Is this capitalism?
[03:22:35.187 --> 03:22:42.531]  Or was Jefferson correct when he said, a central bank issuing a public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[03:22:42.771 --> 03:22:43.852]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[03:22:43.852 --> 03:22:48.234]  I'm placing a silver dollar inside of a book that explains how the monetary system works.
[03:22:48.234 --> 03:22:49.314]  Call for your copy 1-800-686-2237.
[03:22:49.314 --> 03:22:51.175]  Isn't it time to understand the system?
[03:22:51.175 --> 03:22:51.396]  Call 800-686-2237.
[03:22:51.396 --> 03:22:51.716]  That's 800-686-2237.
[03:23:01.465 --> 03:23:12.028]  With food prices soaring to all-time highs, as the dollar continues to fall in value, what can you and your family do to guarantee that fresh, nutritious vegetables will make it to your dinner table?
[03:23:12.028 --> 03:23:13.448]  Garden in a Can.
[03:23:13.448 --> 03:23:17.589]  Garden in a Can is your source for premium, long-term, storable seeds.
[03:23:17.589 --> 03:23:19.609]  Garden in a Can is ready when you are.
[03:23:19.609 --> 03:23:21.890]  Plant them now or store them for when you really need them.
[03:23:22.370 --> 03:23:32.059]  There are 16 large hermetically sealed non-hybrid open pollinated packets of seeds along with detailed planting instructions sealed in a can for ultimate long-term protection.
[03:23:32.059 --> 03:23:33.481]  Garden in a can.
[03:23:33.481 --> 03:23:34.682]  It's that simple.
[03:23:34.682 --> 03:23:35.382]  Fresh.
[03:23:35.382 --> 03:23:36.263]  Healthy.
[03:23:36.263 --> 03:23:37.084]  Easy.
[03:23:37.084 --> 03:23:41.428]  Only $69.95 for over a half acre of safe fresh vegetables.
[03:23:41.428 --> 03:23:42.309]  Ready when you are.

[03:24:09.741 --> 03:24:17.751]  All right, going back to Max Keiser, host of the Oracle on BBC, MaxKeiser.com.
[03:24:17.751 --> 03:24:19.913]  Okay, Max, you got cut off by the break.
[03:24:19.913 --> 03:24:22.877]  Briefly, recap for folks listening.
[03:24:25.552 --> 03:24:45.323]  The magnitude of what you were just talking about, the issue of you've got UBS, this big Swiss bank supposedly with all these accounts, so it gets a $700-something million fine, but then $5 billion of taxpayer money bailout.
[03:24:45.323 --> 03:24:45.504]  Right.
[03:24:45.504 --> 03:24:54.929]  So in other words, AIG, which we all know, AIG is this huge insurance company, so-called,
[03:24:55.529 --> 03:24:57.991]  But it's really something else.
[03:24:57.991 --> 03:25:06.999]  The AIG, what their main business was creating what are called credit default swaps, and I'll get into that in a second.
[03:25:06.999 --> 03:25:17.949]  But basically, the reason why AIG needed $180 billion worth of bailouts was because these credit default swaps were proven to be, you know, counterfeit and bogus.
[03:25:18.680 --> 03:25:21.001]  So the government gave them $180 billion.
[03:25:21.001 --> 03:25:35.624]  Now to pay off their bills, to pay off the people that they were involved with their criminal syndicate of credit default swaps, they end up giving UBS $5 billion of America's tax money that came into AIG from the U.S.
[03:25:35.624 --> 03:25:39.385]  government to bail them out ostensibly, supposedly to help Americans somehow.
[03:25:39.385 --> 03:25:43.526]  But AIG turned around and gave $5 billion to UBS the same week
[03:25:43.993 --> 03:25:45.234]  That UBS is paying the U.S.
[03:25:45.234 --> 03:25:50.258]  government a $750 million fine for being caught aiding tax evaders.
[03:25:50.258 --> 03:25:53.241]  Isn't Morocco... Sorry, go ahead.
[03:25:53.241 --> 03:26:02.649]  Yeah, UBS gets a $4.25 billion gift from the American public for being caught aiding people to evade taxes.
[03:26:02.649 --> 03:26:05.892]  The problem is just not that there's a lack of justice.
[03:26:05.892 --> 03:26:09.135]  The problem is that there's a psychosis involved
[03:26:09.514 --> 03:26:14.237]  At the highest levels of the banking system, where you've got, like, Caligula in charge of these banks.
[03:26:14.237 --> 03:26:17.058]  They're psychotic thugs.
[03:26:17.058 --> 03:26:20.040]  They're not losing morality.
[03:26:20.040 --> 03:26:21.541]  It's not a moral hazard.
[03:26:21.541 --> 03:26:23.262]  It's a moral vacuum.
[03:26:23.262 --> 03:26:24.763]  They're psychotic.
[03:26:24.763 --> 03:26:26.043]  They think they can get away with this.
[03:26:26.043 --> 03:26:26.764]  It's absurd.
[03:26:26.764 --> 03:26:34.728]  But there are a couple of other examples where these bankers, you see that they've become, you know, like this Caligula capitalist, as I call it.
[03:26:34.728 --> 03:26:37.830]  Just recently, you know, there was this huge protest in London against
[03:26:38.516 --> 03:26:46.078]  The hedge fund industry, people are on the street, they're protesting against the hedge funds, they're outside the Bank of England on Threadneedle Street in London.
[03:26:46.078 --> 03:26:53.700]  The bankers are waving ten pound notes out the windows trying to incite the protesters to commit violence.
[03:26:53.700 --> 03:26:54.560]  Why?
[03:26:54.560 --> 03:27:03.342]  Because they have made bets on online betting exchanges as to how many protesters would be injured or killed during the demonstrations and protests.
[03:27:03.342 --> 03:27:06.763]  They have bankers trying to incite people to get killed because they've got a bet.
[03:27:07.849 --> 03:27:16.935]  Do you remember when the Pentagon wanted to create a hedge fund on when the next terror attack was coming to make money off of it?
[03:27:37.762 --> 03:27:47.604]  But it got picked up by the Pentagon, and they launched this thing, or they tried to, called the Policy Analysis Market, where people could buy and sell securities based on terror attacks.
[03:27:47.604 --> 03:27:51.205]  And my point at that time was that you're just encouraging terror attacks.
[03:27:51.205 --> 03:28:00.407]  It's like the people, you know, not... I don't want to get into the whole 9-11 thing, but, you know, people were making bets on exploding airplanes in the weeks leading up to 9-11.
[03:28:00.407 --> 03:28:03.868]  Obviously, that's true, because the volume of bets against big airlines
[03:28:04.623 --> 03:28:08.885]  That they were going to explode was increased 10 to 20 times.
[03:28:08.885 --> 03:28:15.829]  It was no secret that people were making bets against, that what turned out to be, they were making bets against themselves.
[03:28:15.829 --> 03:28:22.253]  But you see this type of moral vacuousness where these bankers are actually destroying themselves.
[03:28:22.253 --> 03:28:25.515]  They're destroying their own economy because it becomes psychotic.
[03:28:25.515 --> 03:28:33.279]  The embezzlement and the fraud has run into levels that are beyond just what Mike Milken did back at Jax O'Byrne.
[03:28:33.689 --> 03:28:36.831]  It's become a whole other magnitude.
[03:28:36.831 --> 03:28:45.516]  You have Goldman Sachs, of course, very famously last year, sold bonds to municipalities while at the same time selling short those bonds, attacking their customers.
[03:28:45.516 --> 03:28:51.399]  You have the example of Armour, a company called Armour Plating, I think the name is.
[03:28:51.399 --> 03:28:55.421]  They make material for soldiers, U.S.
[03:28:55.421 --> 03:28:57.082]  soldiers in Iran and Iraq.
[03:28:57.082 --> 03:29:01.544]  They couldn't raise money last year because the hedge funds were selling the stock short.
[03:29:01.544 --> 03:29:02.485]  They were killing the stock.
[03:29:02.947 --> 03:29:07.050]  They were selling the stock naked, which means you're selling stock that doesn't exist.
[03:29:07.050 --> 03:29:08.532]  You're selling counterfeit stock.
[03:29:08.532 --> 03:29:12.195]  The company couldn't raise any more money, and as a result, of course, U.S.
[03:29:12.195 --> 03:29:18.980]  soldiers were in harm's way, because the hedge funds thought that their profits were more important than the lives of the U.S.
[03:29:18.980 --> 03:29:20.001]  soldiers.
[03:29:20.001 --> 03:29:21.863]  And again, it's the divine right of hedge funds.
[03:29:21.863 --> 03:29:23.404]  It was a company called Force.
[03:29:24.299 --> 03:29:27.720]  Yeah, stay there Max Keiser, stay there.
[03:29:27.720 --> 03:29:29.361]  This is just amazing.
[03:29:29.361 --> 03:29:31.542]  Everything he's saying is documented on record.
[03:29:31.542 --> 03:29:44.867]  That's how destructive, parasitic, carnivorous, it's not just looting, they're killing the golden goose that lays the eggs and all leaving the United States to live in armored compounds in the Caribbean.
[03:29:44.867 --> 03:29:49.169]  MaxKeiser.com is his website, my website is InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[03:29:49.169 --> 03:29:51.110]  We'll be right back with him and a state rep.
[03:29:51.874 --> 03:29:53.255]  We're on the march.
[03:29:53.255 --> 03:29:54.855]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:29:54.855 --> 03:30:01.879]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:01.879 --> 03:30:03.239]  Hello, this is Steve Shank.
[03:30:03.239 --> 03:30:05.640]  Alex has told you you have to get a supply of food.
[03:30:05.640 --> 03:30:09.802]  But Alex and I have decided that there are some of you that we really don't want to have food.
[03:30:09.802 --> 03:30:11.783]  If you're a politician who voted for the bailout,
[03:30:16.554 --> 03:30:25.957]  If you think growing food for cars is better than feeding people, don't get food.
[03:30:25.957 --> 03:30:32.339]  If you think waiting for a cop to show up after a crime is better than defending yourself and preventing the crime, don't call eFoods Direct.
[03:30:32.339 --> 03:30:35.940]  If you believe the official report on 9-11, you won't need food.
[03:30:35.940 --> 03:30:40.341]  If you think the warnings on the Alex Jones Show are foolish, don't call eFoods Direct.
[03:30:40.341 --> 03:30:42.002]  For the rest of you, go to eFoods.com.
[03:30:44.517 --> 03:30:45.778]  In the New World Order's war against humanity,
[03:31:05.413 --> 03:31:08.035]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[03:31:08.035 --> 03:31:15.062]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[03:31:15.603 --> 03:31:22.186]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[03:31:22.186 --> 03:31:24.166]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[03:31:24.166 --> 03:31:26.667]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[03:31:26.667 --> 03:31:38.252]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[03:31:38.252 --> 03:31:39.912]  It's not about left or right.
[03:31:39.912 --> 03:31:41.293]  It's about a one-world government.
[03:31:41.784 --> 03:31:48.690]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[03:31:48.690 --> 03:31:56.957]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:31:56.957 --> 03:31:58.539]  The Obama Deception.
[03:31:58.539 --> 03:31:59.720]  The people strike back.
[03:32:02.796 --> 03:32:08.302]  With our economy spiraling out of control, living in the soup kitchens may be right around the corner.
[03:32:08.302 --> 03:32:11.325]  No one saw the financial collapse of 1929.
[03:32:11.325 --> 03:32:16.791]  Many didn't make it, and millions ended up in soup lines, becoming vagrants, begging for food.
[03:32:17.523 --> 03:32:21.185]  Unlike 1929, we can see this collapse coming.
[03:32:21.185 --> 03:32:22.486]  We have been warned.
[03:32:22.486 --> 03:32:28.750]  And right now, we have a very small window of opportunity to get food storage into our homes before it's too late.
[03:32:28.750 --> 03:32:29.491]  Too late.
[03:32:29.491 --> 03:32:32.693]  Why is the Canadian government telling their citizens to stock up?
[03:32:32.693 --> 03:32:33.133]  Why?
[03:32:33.133 --> 03:32:37.135]  And why are soldiers calling home telling their families to get food storage?
[03:32:37.135 --> 03:32:38.296]  Supplies are running low.
[03:32:38.678 --> 03:32:45.160]  Having food storage today may be just as important to your family's survival as boarding the Ark was in the days of Noah.
[03:32:45.160 --> 03:32:49.081]  Order right now and receive free shipping on all one-year supplies.
[03:32:49.081 --> 03:32:51.542]  Go to YourFoodStorage.com.
[03:32:51.542 --> 03:32:53.323]  That's YourFoodStorage.com.
[03:32:53.323 --> 03:32:54.203]  Or call 877-482-FOOD.
[03:32:54.203 --> 03:32:54.803]  That's 877-482-FOOD today!
[03:33:16.124 --> 03:33:22.730]  We ran a story Friday and Saturday about regular Army to run checkpoints all over Tennessee with Homeland Security.
[03:33:22.730 --> 03:33:24.472]  We ran it last Thursday.
[03:33:24.472 --> 03:33:27.815]  By Friday, the Governor got involved and said, no, we're not doing this.
[03:33:27.815 --> 03:33:34.301]  They're going to have Army, not just the police running warrantless checkpoints, but the Army doing it with the police.
[03:33:35.748 --> 03:33:48.873]  And last hour we played a clip off the news, Representative John Shaw, Republican, I mean, Representative for Tennessee District 80, on the show talking about how upset people were about this and how they got that shot down.
[03:33:48.873 --> 03:33:50.174]  And he's on a very important phone call.
[03:33:50.174 --> 03:33:51.934]  He'll be joining us, he said, in one minute.
[03:33:51.934 --> 03:34:00.638]  If not, we're going to move on back to Max Keiser, because I've got a lot of questions for him on the economy, and he is quite the brain on those subjects.
[03:34:00.638 --> 03:34:02.879]  While we're waiting, Representative John Shaw,
[03:34:04.380 --> 03:34:10.730]  To join us, listen folks, I need you to get the Obama Deception on DVD at Infowars.com.
[03:34:10.730 --> 03:34:13.594]  This film is waking people up big time.
[03:34:14.520 --> 03:34:16.742]  This film is changing minds.
[03:34:16.742 --> 03:34:21.925]  This film is unlocking people's perspective.
[03:34:21.925 --> 03:34:25.287]  Obama is a distraction and a diversion, just like George Bush was.
[03:34:25.287 --> 03:34:35.814]  You have the shadow banking system, you have a national security state that's over Europe, England, the United States, that does whatever it wants, whenever it wants, for so long that that's what Max Keiser was just talking about.
[03:34:35.814 --> 03:34:38.696]  They're so arrogant now, they do whatever they want.
[03:34:38.696 --> 03:34:41.818]  I mean, Obama could be an angel, and we say that in the film.
[03:34:41.818 --> 03:34:43.419]  Still, the establishment's in control.
[03:34:43.419 --> 03:34:44.120]  He's not in control.
[03:34:45.979 --> 03:34:58.841]  And so we explain that and say, look, either the bankers get arrested and brought to justice, and this madness ends, or they're going to destroy us all financially, and then build their world government on the ashes of that, and that's what they plan to do.
[03:34:58.841 --> 03:35:06.843]  So please get the Obama Deception at Infowars.com, or get the Obama Deception in super high quality downloaded at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:35:06.843 --> 03:35:12.164]  We've got DivX copies to burn to disk, to give to people that play on DVD players in high quality.
[03:35:12.944 --> 03:35:16.605]  I mean, this is a factory of resistance, an armory in the Infowars.
[03:35:16.605 --> 03:35:19.606]  Get the Obama Deception today at Infowars.com.
[03:35:19.606 --> 03:35:22.447]  Expose these criminals while we still have time.
[03:35:22.447 --> 03:35:24.488]  We're going into a depression, there's no doubt about that.
[03:35:24.488 --> 03:35:27.589]  You can also call toll free to get the Obama Deception, 888-253-3139.
[03:35:27.589 --> 03:35:27.969]  That's 888-253-3139.
[03:35:27.969 --> 03:35:30.430]  And do we have Representative John Shaw yet?
[03:35:39.360 --> 03:35:44.782]  Okay, I'm going to go ahead and bring Max Keiser up and then if he comes on later I'll have him on for like three minutes or I may just cancel him.
[03:35:44.782 --> 03:35:47.542]  We've already played the clip of him on air and I don't have time for this.
[03:35:47.542 --> 03:35:50.823]  These state reps are always harder to get than congressmen.
[03:35:50.823 --> 03:35:53.164]  Max Keiser, are you back or did you take a break?
[03:35:53.164 --> 03:35:54.444]  No, I'm here.
[03:35:54.444 --> 03:35:56.165]  Okay, good my friend.
[03:35:56.165 --> 03:36:05.448]  Specifically, what does that sound like to you to have the Army just announce we're going to run checkpoints for homeland security in the middle of Tennessee?
[03:36:05.448 --> 03:36:06.708]  Yeah, well, you know,
[03:36:07.372 --> 03:36:16.065]  The problem is that because the government is so bankrupt, that one of the ways they're going to raise money is by nickel and diming people to death.
[03:36:16.065 --> 03:36:19.811]  And so this whole idea of stopping people, searching people,
[03:36:20.442 --> 03:36:25.025]  You know, your car is parked five inches away from the curb, more than it should be.
[03:36:25.025 --> 03:36:27.386]  All the CCTV cameras watching everything.
[03:36:27.386 --> 03:36:29.127]  This is just a way to raise money, basically.
[03:36:29.127 --> 03:36:30.287]  You're nickel-and-dining people to death.
[03:36:30.287 --> 03:36:38.012]  It's just like we're back in the Sherwood Forest, and you've got people trying to get through the forest, and they're constantly being held up.
[03:36:38.012 --> 03:36:39.132]  It's all about the money, Alex.
[03:36:39.132 --> 03:36:41.814]  It's not about protection or security.
[03:36:41.814 --> 03:36:46.076]  It's just another way to reach into your pocket and pull out more money.
[03:36:46.076 --> 03:36:48.637]  And these guys who get the contracts and do all these programs,
[03:36:50.420 --> 03:36:53.783]  ...are on the same group of people that we're talking about.
[03:36:53.783 --> 03:37:00.588]  They're part of this banking and government oligarchy.
[03:37:00.588 --> 03:37:03.710]  You know the great... I don't know if you've seen this one, Alex, but you really should.
[03:37:03.710 --> 03:37:09.475]  There's a great 12-part series on YouTube called Collapse in Argentina, or Argentina Collapse.
[03:37:09.475 --> 03:37:18.702]  And it documents the collapse in Argentina and the fusing of the legal system, the banks, and the political system into one
[03:37:19.669 --> 03:37:21.730]  One, you know, five fingers of death, if you will.
[03:37:21.730 --> 03:37:26.593]  They just totally reached into the economy and destroyed it through utter corruption.
[03:37:26.593 --> 03:37:28.894]  And we're seeing this right now in the U.S.
[03:37:28.894 --> 03:37:30.015]  They're following that playbook.
[03:37:30.015 --> 03:37:40.261]  This guy Carlos Menon of Argentina is really a role model going forward in terms of how to undermine a community.
[03:37:40.802 --> 03:37:44.203]  But let's get back for a second to... Hold on, hold on.
[03:37:44.203 --> 03:37:45.504]  That's where I wanted to go with this.
[03:37:45.504 --> 03:37:46.624]  Hold on, Max.
[03:37:46.624 --> 03:37:50.506]  The IMF and World Bank documents talk about how they go pay off governments.
[03:37:50.506 --> 03:37:54.007]  They have the governments not pay the loans back at loan-sharking rates.
[03:37:54.007 --> 03:37:55.507]  Then the economy implodes.
[03:37:55.507 --> 03:37:59.709]  Then they declare police state martial law to further destroy confidence.
[03:37:59.709 --> 03:38:00.789]  People riot.
[03:38:00.789 --> 03:38:02.970]  That causes even more confidence to fall.
[03:38:02.970 --> 03:38:07.112]  Then the offshore banks come in and buy it up for pennies on the dollar.
[03:38:07.112 --> 03:38:08.872]  And so there's a method to their madness.
[03:38:08.872 --> 03:38:09.533]  They brag.
[03:38:10.493 --> 03:38:16.716]  They love the insane looting and the open stealing because they control the national security apparatus.
[03:38:16.716 --> 03:38:17.956]  They're in control.
[03:38:17.956 --> 03:38:20.838]  They've got the military and the police ready to follow orders.
[03:38:20.838 --> 03:38:22.298]  And so the world is their oyster.
[03:38:22.298 --> 03:38:30.882]  They're just scorched earth using economics as a weapon to blast the whole world economy so on its ashes they can build this new bank of the world.
[03:38:30.882 --> 03:38:33.643]  The only question is that we pay our carbon taxes to.
[03:38:33.643 --> 03:38:36.244]  The only question is will they get away with it, Max Keiser?
[03:38:38.024 --> 03:38:46.068]  I think there's a couple of things that people can do to offer some kind of balance to the situation.
[03:38:46.068 --> 03:38:53.251]  One, you know, throughout history, I think, why should there be now a global passive resistance movement?
[03:38:53.251 --> 03:38:55.532]  You know, passive resistance movements in the U.S.
[03:38:55.532 --> 03:38:59.434]  worked during the Civil Rights era, and in India under the Gandhi era they worked.
[03:38:59.434 --> 03:39:07.118]  You know, maybe to fight the global, to feed this global insurrection against this corporate and banking occupation that we're seeing all over the world.
[03:39:07.452 --> 03:39:11.073]  There should be a global program of global civil disobedience.
[03:39:11.073 --> 03:39:26.858]  For example, one easy thing that people can do to start to destabilize the oligarchy is to completely avoid all copyrighted material and to make your own copyrighted material, make your own content.
[03:39:26.858 --> 03:39:31.259]  Now to this end, I actually am launching a new website this week.
[03:39:31.259 --> 03:39:33.100]  It's called piratemyfilm.com.
[03:39:34.901 --> 03:39:35.902]  Oh, that's what I do!
[03:39:35.902 --> 03:39:37.203]  Hold on.
[03:39:37.203 --> 03:39:43.868]  Max Keiser, I want a BBC News reporter, host his own show, MaxKeiser.com, Invented Stock Market System.
[03:39:43.868 --> 03:39:44.908]  Stay there.
[03:39:44.908 --> 03:39:47.270]  We've got the state rep, so just stay there for a moment.
[03:39:47.270 --> 03:39:47.970]  I apologize.
[03:39:47.970 --> 03:39:51.133]  I want to get him on because this is breaking news.
[03:39:51.133 --> 03:39:54.295]  Representative John Shaw just joins us for a few minutes.
[03:39:54.295 --> 03:39:56.837]  Representative from Tennessee, District 80.
[03:39:56.837 --> 03:39:58.198]  Sir, thank you for coming on with us.
[03:39:58.809 --> 03:39:59.710]  Sure, you're welcome.
[03:39:59.710 --> 03:40:01.271]  Thank you for having me, Alex.
[03:40:01.271 --> 03:40:01.671]  You bet.
[03:40:01.671 --> 03:40:07.135]  Now, we played the clip earlier of you on a local news station talking about army checkpoints.
[03:40:07.135 --> 03:40:10.518]  The governor found out, thanks to you and others, and canceled it.
[03:40:10.518 --> 03:40:15.422]  Can you just, in a nutshell, tell us exactly, specifically, what was going on?
[03:40:16.637 --> 03:40:17.478]  Yes, I can.
[03:40:17.478 --> 03:40:20.620]  First of all, I have got to check now.
[03:40:20.620 --> 03:40:28.925]  I don't have concrete facts, but I don't think the military has, first of all, any jurisdiction to be checking seatbelts, number one.
[03:40:28.925 --> 03:40:38.772]  But number two, because of the economy in our area, we just got news a couple of weeks ago that the state may be closing down
[03:40:39.472 --> 03:40:51.182]  One of our private correctional facilities, which is going to eliminate about 350 jobs if that happens, unless they can re-bid these bids to some other state.
[03:40:51.182 --> 03:40:52.983]  Now we don't know right now where we are.
[03:40:52.983 --> 03:40:55.245]  That's still a proposal.
[03:40:55.245 --> 03:40:57.607]  It has not yet been decided upon.
[03:40:57.607 --> 03:41:00.109]  And therefore, that is one of the reasons why I said
[03:41:00.709 --> 03:41:05.010]  That the governor does not need this extra headache in that area right now.
[03:41:05.010 --> 03:41:19.633]  And then I think thirdly, when you look at the fact of a military unit being out, your daughter, my wife, or someone driving through a roadblock with all of these local officials, the army and everybody out there, I think it's just going to scare people to death.
[03:41:19.633 --> 03:41:25.874]  I think our local and state officials have the staff when needed to check seatbelts,
[03:41:26.714 --> 03:41:32.538]  To do a seatbelt check without the army getting involved, and I just don't think it's a good idea.
[03:41:32.538 --> 03:41:37.521]  Well, obviously, sir, I don't know if you've heard, but yes, it still violates Posse Comitatus.
[03:41:37.521 --> 03:41:40.843]  They haven't completely removed that 1878 law.
[03:41:40.843 --> 03:41:44.045]  We know in Mexico and Communist China, they have troops on the streets.
[03:41:44.045 --> 03:41:49.909]  This is a sign of a banana republic of a third world police state, so we don't want that.
[03:41:49.909 --> 03:41:51.369]  But the larger issue here
[03:41:52.390 --> 03:41:59.035]  Is that they've announced Homeland Security wants to put 20,000 regular Army troops to patrol America.
[03:41:59.035 --> 03:42:08.301]  The Naval War College, the Army War College has said their new job will be engaging us in combat with the American people to stop an insurrection against the banks.
[03:42:08.301 --> 03:42:09.602]  So, A, are you aware of that?
[03:42:09.602 --> 03:42:16.167]  B, can you tell us specifically what units, how we, why the Army was going to be out running checkpoints?
[03:42:16.874 --> 03:42:27.419]  Well, and I'm not aware of that, and let me just tell you, I found this out late on Friday evening myself, when some calls started to come in to my local office.
[03:42:27.419 --> 03:42:38.725]  I am in Nashville at State Capitol, Monday through Thursday, so give or take noon, two-ish, three o'clock in the afternoon time, but I'm in my district on Fridays.
[03:42:38.725 --> 03:42:43.588]  Well, I got this news late on Friday, and when I got the news, I immediately jumped on it.
[03:42:44.148 --> 03:42:48.749]  To try to call some local authorities that I knew first to see what was going on.
[03:42:48.749 --> 03:42:59.171]  And when I made the call, I had found out, or I found out at that point in time, that the governor had already made the decision to cancel this, and which I was very proud of that.
[03:42:59.171 --> 03:43:02.852]  But I am not aware of Homeland Security doing this.
[03:43:02.852 --> 03:43:11.294]  I did hear that they would be involved in this roadblock issue on last Friday, but I am not aware of the other part of the question that you asked.
[03:43:11.514 --> 03:43:21.083]  Okay, specifically though, when you talk to the local authorities, whose idea, where did it come from that regular army is going to be out running checkpoints?
[03:43:21.083 --> 03:43:26.487]  I mean, a checkpoint is unconstitutional if you don't have warrants and it's random for the police to do.
[03:43:26.487 --> 03:43:27.408]  Now the army?
[03:43:27.408 --> 03:43:30.211]  I mean, again, sir, this is suddenly happening everywhere.
[03:43:30.211 --> 03:43:31.552]  This is part of a larger plan.
[03:43:31.552 --> 03:43:38.138]  So we as detectives are asking you, any other little tidbits you've got about who was behind this?
[03:43:38.922 --> 03:43:40.763]  Well, and I don't know, Alex.
[03:43:40.763 --> 03:43:58.629]  I can't answer that question other than the fact that it was going to take place in a little area of my district in a town called Whiteville, Tennessee, which would lead me to believe or to assume that the chief of police there was the one who orchestrated this idea.
[03:43:58.629 --> 03:44:02.831]  Now, to say that is a fact, I don't know, because I have not spoken to him.
[03:44:03.943 --> 03:44:05.345]  Uh, directly.
[03:44:05.345 --> 03:44:09.148]  I've spoken to some other officials, uh... Was the state involved?
[03:44:09.148 --> 03:44:10.790]  Because we're almost out of time and I'm sorry to interrupt.
[03:44:10.790 --> 03:44:11.731]  Was the state involved?
[03:44:12.452 --> 03:44:14.613]  Uh, not to my knowledge at all.
[03:44:14.613 --> 03:44:18.094]  Okay, so the Governor had to say no, so this is what we always see.
[03:44:18.094 --> 03:44:23.637]  The Army then probably approached some locals as part of their covert acclimation program.
[03:44:23.637 --> 03:44:28.558]  And State Representative Johnny Shaw, we appreciate you speaking out against this.
[03:44:28.558 --> 03:44:31.120]  We appreciate the Governor saying no to this.
[03:44:31.120 --> 03:44:34.501]  Can you, just in closing, speak to why you were concerned about it and against it?
[03:44:35.100 --> 03:44:49.778]  Well, again, I was concerned because I think in this economic climate, or in this climate that we are in, with all of the terrorist attacks, etc., so forth and so on, can you imagine your wife, your daughter, my wife, or daughter, even son, driving up
[03:44:50.856 --> 03:45:00.399]  To a checkpoint with Homeland Security, the military police, the state police, if they were involved, and then of course all of your local authorities.
[03:45:00.399 --> 03:45:06.100]  This is going to make someone think something bad has happened in the community and I just don't think this is a good idea.
[03:45:06.100 --> 03:45:08.301]  I think it would have been a scare tactic.
[03:45:08.761 --> 03:45:27.008]  That would have been hard for some of our citizens to get over or maybe some of our senior citizens and I'm totally against this kind of a tactic and I'm going to do my best as a state representative to see that this does not happen again in my district and hopefully nowhere in the state of Tennessee.
[03:45:27.008 --> 03:45:29.689]  Okay, Mr. Shaw, Representative Shaw, thank you for the time.
[03:45:30.339 --> 03:45:31.580]  Thank you for having me.
[03:45:31.580 --> 03:45:32.561]  Take care.
[03:45:32.561 --> 03:45:40.887]  Okay, Max Keiser, I apologize for making you wait five minutes when we invited you on here, but this is breaking, and I wanted to just get that on record.
[03:45:40.887 --> 03:45:44.030]  Again, Max, it isn't just about raising money.
[03:45:44.030 --> 03:45:49.134]  Suddenly, all over, the Marines are at DWI checkpoints, the Army's at mass shootings.
[03:45:49.134 --> 03:45:54.598]  Suddenly, they're putting liaison officers in all the major police departments in the Intelligence Bureau.
[03:45:54.598 --> 03:45:56.620]  This is slow-motion martial law.
[03:45:57.560 --> 03:46:06.625]  Yeah, well, when you have an economy like America, which is 70% consumption and something like 10-15% military, you know, you've got to give them something to do.
[03:46:06.625 --> 03:46:11.187]  You know, this is just the business of America is the military and consumption.
[03:46:11.187 --> 03:46:18.231]  So you've got huge health problems with overconsumption, huge economic problems, and you've got your military sitting in your backyard.
[03:46:18.231 --> 03:46:23.574]  Because the economy needs to be re-architected to reflect something else.
[03:46:23.574 --> 03:46:27.016]  This current economic architecture of America, of consumption and militarism,
[03:46:27.517 --> 03:46:27.917]  I think so.
[03:46:42.079 --> 03:46:47.541]  To create a country that buys military purchases and consumer products.
[03:46:47.541 --> 03:46:48.882]  Instead, Max!
[03:46:48.882 --> 03:46:49.882]  Instead, Max!
[03:46:49.882 --> 03:46:51.103]  You know, Luke, for those people.
[03:46:51.103 --> 03:46:52.903]  But it doesn't have to be that way.
[03:46:52.903 --> 03:46:58.345]  There's nothing in the world that nobody... You know, the fact is, America is 5% of the world population.
[03:46:58.345 --> 03:47:00.506]  The GDP is shrinking rapidly.
[03:47:00.506 --> 03:47:02.467]  It has a very high opinion of itself.
[03:47:02.467 --> 03:47:04.748]  You know, who really cares about it anymore?
[03:47:04.748 --> 03:47:07.469]  I mean, the other economies are growing faster.
[03:47:07.469 --> 03:47:10.190]  They're more interesting, they're more dynamic in Asia and the Mideast and Europe.
[03:47:10.683 --> 03:47:17.349]  You know, America thinks, you know, it's becoming kind of a forgotten country at this point because it just doesn't do that much anymore.
[03:47:17.349 --> 03:47:22.633]  You know, the athletes are all on steroids, the Olympics are fixed, the banking systems are fraud.
[03:47:22.633 --> 03:47:23.754]  Who really thinks about it?
[03:47:23.754 --> 03:47:26.396]  If you leave America, nobody talks about America anymore.
[03:47:26.396 --> 03:47:35.043]  Sure, Barack Obama's a very photogenic guy, and he's great in Europe, and they applaud him, but by this time next week, he will be, you know, forgotten.
[03:47:35.043 --> 03:47:39.547]  And the people are going to be focusing on jobs, quality of life, and issues that are important,
[03:47:40.074 --> 03:47:47.158]  Within the economies here in Europe that do not feed into consumerism and radical militarization.
[03:47:47.158 --> 03:47:48.679]  That's not what the economy is based in.
[03:47:48.679 --> 03:47:51.140]  Max Keiser, I interrupted you earlier.
[03:47:51.140 --> 03:47:56.003]  I wanted you to finish up with your new website dealing with changing the paradigm.
[03:47:56.003 --> 03:47:58.284]  Yeah, changing paradigm is exactly right.
[03:47:58.284 --> 03:48:01.866]  The site is called piratemyfilm.com.
[03:48:01.866 --> 03:48:08.330]  It gives filmmakers a way to finance their films by pre-selling what I call gold copies to people
[03:48:08.792 --> 03:48:17.839]  Who are then entitled to a percentage of any ad revenues that might be generated once the film is released to the pirate network.
[03:48:17.839 --> 03:48:21.342]  So I say, instead of fighting the pirates, work with the pirates.
[03:48:21.342 --> 03:48:26.486]  Because the copyright so-called pirates, they're being vilified unnecessarily.
[03:48:26.486 --> 03:48:31.429]  All they're doing is stretching the limits of technology and challenging unjust copyright laws.
[03:48:31.429 --> 03:48:34.772]  And they're being, again, caught up in the military in the U.S.
[03:48:35.194 --> 03:48:38.015]  And it's killing intellectual property in the U.S.
[03:48:38.015 --> 03:48:39.935]  It's stifling creativity in the U.S.
[03:48:39.935 --> 03:48:47.337]  To have things on copyright law for 20, 30, 40, 50, lifetime, plus 70 years, is like having an intellectual lobotomy.
[03:48:47.337 --> 03:48:53.538]  And that's part of the reason America can't think its way out of these problems, is because all the good ideas are locked up on corporate balance sheets.
[03:48:53.538 --> 03:49:01.780]  If I say this site, piratemyfilm.com, it gives filmmakers and creatives a chance to raise money for projects by pre-selling future ad revenue.
[03:49:02.754 --> 03:49:08.220]  And it's all based on some of my previous designs and some of my previous websites.
[03:49:08.220 --> 03:49:14.947]  All I have up right now is a splash page, but I'm going to start to introduce more functionality in the very next few days.
[03:49:14.947 --> 03:49:18.290]  All right, Max Keiser, I've got a lot of final questions I want to get to with you.
[03:49:18.290 --> 03:49:23.276]  You know, I talked about how bad will it get, but let's try to cover that.
[03:49:23.276 --> 03:49:24.917]  But first, Barack Obama.
[03:49:25.888 --> 03:49:37.170]  I see him, just as a diversion and as a distraction, that the establishment is using all the very same power structure, outside of even his control, just moves forward with their agenda.
[03:49:37.170 --> 03:49:38.711]  Your take on that?
[03:49:38.711 --> 03:49:40.031]  Well, I've been on your show before, Alec.
[03:49:40.031 --> 03:49:44.272]  I said two statements that I want to revisit right now.
[03:49:44.272 --> 03:49:47.932]  Leading up to the Barack Obama election, I said, you know, I'm going to give the benefit of the doubt.
[03:49:47.932 --> 03:49:54.594]  I'm not going to really come out and be critical of Barack Obama, even though the people in his cabinet look the exact same people as the Bush cabinet.
[03:49:54.594 --> 03:49:55.554]  But give him the benefit of the doubt.
[03:49:55.993 --> 03:50:12.738]  Now, I've seen what I've seen, and it looks like he's totally in the pocket of Wall Street and these guys, and I'm absolutely flabbergasted, because it doesn't appear as though he's really making any kind of moves to extricate himself from the iron grip of these financial oligarchs.
[03:50:12.738 --> 03:50:14.399]  It kind of saddens me.
[03:50:14.399 --> 03:50:19.160]  The other thing I mentioned on your show a couple of months ago was that there would be a run on the COMEX and the gold market back in December.
[03:50:19.881 --> 03:50:27.832]  That did not happen, but we did just get news that Deutsche Bank was involved in a massive manipulation on the COMEX in the past couple of weeks.
[03:50:27.832 --> 03:50:32.619]  So there's still a lot of fun and games going on in the COMEX, the gold futures markets in New York.
[03:50:33.106 --> 03:50:40.589]  There wasn't a run as I predicted back in December, but there is a lot of skullduggery going on in that market.
[03:50:40.589 --> 03:50:45.972]  Well, to be fair, you said you thought it might happen, but they might be able to manipulate themselves out of it.
[03:50:45.972 --> 03:50:53.155]  I mean, the IMF just announced they're going to sell their gold to try to drive it down again, so it's like a beach ball they're trying to hold under.
[03:50:53.155 --> 03:50:56.556]  I got a key question for Max Keiser straight ahead after this quick break.
[03:50:56.556 --> 03:50:58.637]  Final segment, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:50:58.637 --> 03:50:59.077]  Stay with us.
[03:50:59.077 --> 03:51:00.338]  His website's MaxKeiser.com.
[03:51:02.208 --> 03:51:03.329]  Spring is here.
[03:51:03.329 --> 03:51:04.290]  Growing season.
[03:51:04.290 --> 03:51:06.492]  The economy is not getting any better.
[03:51:06.492 --> 03:51:08.213]  In fact, it's getting worse.
[03:51:08.213 --> 03:51:09.174]  Think about it.
[03:51:09.174 --> 03:51:13.277]  At this rate, how will your life be in a month or even a year?
[03:51:13.277 --> 03:51:17.020]  Maybe you've been putting things off, but the time to act is now.
[03:51:17.020 --> 03:51:18.922]  The country is running out of food.
[03:51:18.922 --> 03:51:21.444]  You need to get your seeds before it's too late.
[03:51:21.744 --> 03:51:33.931]  At OrganicaSeed.com, you'll find one of the largest online selections of heirloom seeds, survival seed packs, as well as the giant vegetable seed collections that can feed you and your family for years.
[03:51:33.931 --> 03:51:36.613]  Grow your very own fresh vegetables, wheatgrass,
[03:51:36.633 --> 03:51:39.094]  In the New World Order's War Against Humanity,
[03:52:05.393 --> 03:52:08.235]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[03:52:08.235 --> 03:52:14.119]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[03:52:14.119 --> 03:52:20.604]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[03:52:20.604 --> 03:52:22.585]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[03:52:22.585 --> 03:52:25.047]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[03:52:25.047 --> 03:52:34.794]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs
[03:52:35.256 --> 03:52:38.238]  That's fascism.
[03:52:38.238 --> 03:52:39.899]  It's not about left or right.
[03:52:39.899 --> 03:52:41.760]  It's about a one world government.
[03:52:41.760 --> 03:52:48.664]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[03:53:01.277 --> 03:53:06.661]  Have you ever read the ingredients in your skin creams, personal hygiene products, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
[03:53:06.661 --> 03:53:15.228]  Did you know that most skin creams, body lotions, shampoos, and toothpastes contain chemical additives such as sodium lauryl sulfate, the same type of detergent used in dish soap?
[03:53:15.228 --> 03:53:18.811]  Did you know that many multivitamin supplements are made from synthetic vitamins?
[03:53:18.811 --> 03:53:22.033]  Do your herbal remedies have unwanted additives and fillers?
[03:53:22.033 --> 03:53:24.535]  Have you ever tested your body's pH level?
[03:53:24.535 --> 03:53:27.518]  Make the change to organic health and beauty products.

[03:53:53.579 --> 03:53:54.219]  All our times have come
[03:54:22.963 --> 03:54:27.408]  All right, he joins us from Paris.
[03:54:27.408 --> 03:54:28.288]  He's Max Keiser.
[03:54:28.288 --> 03:54:34.874]  We're going to do about 10-15 minutes of overdrive when the main radio show ends in about five minutes.
[03:54:36.286 --> 03:54:38.528]  So understand that, folks.
[03:54:38.528 --> 03:54:41.951]  We are going to go into overdrive.
[03:54:41.951 --> 03:54:46.575]  Today, we're going to talk about the new global currency, what Max Keiser's been talking about on the news.
[03:54:46.575 --> 03:54:51.500]  I'm going to play his clip where he talked about the controlled demolition of our economy.
[03:54:51.500 --> 03:54:57.105]  Before we go back to Max Keiser, AcolaBlue.com is one of the sponsors that makes this radio show.
[03:54:57.665 --> 03:55:00.047]  Possible atmospheric water generator for your home.
[03:55:00.047 --> 03:55:02.948]  Pays for itself in one year if you buy your water from the store.
[03:55:02.948 --> 03:55:04.549]  Pure clean water without the fluoride.
[03:55:04.549 --> 03:55:06.531]  Unlimited water from the humidity in the air.
[03:55:06.531 --> 03:55:08.372]  Know exactly what you're drinking.
[03:55:08.372 --> 03:55:11.674]  Machine produces up to 28 liters of water in 24 hours.
[03:55:11.674 --> 03:55:15.937]  The generated water is passed through seven filters including reverse, osmosis, and carbon.
[03:55:16.497 --> 03:55:20.159]  Again, that number is 1-800-691-6043.
[03:55:20.159 --> 03:55:24.622]  1-800-691-6043 or acolablue.com.

[03:55:25.703 --> 03:55:30.586]  Also, mysolarbackup.com, a great solar generator system.
[03:55:30.586 --> 03:55:35.589]  The PowerSource 1800 power plant with high efficiency solar panel designed to provide endless electricity.
[03:55:36.229 --> 03:55:42.476]  Remember too that with gas generators need gas, so in a blackout you need a solar panel that's plugged into battery system.
[03:55:42.476 --> 03:55:45.319]  They've got a great one at MySolarBackup.com or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[03:55:51.891 --> 03:55:53.211]  0365mysolarbackup.com.
[03:55:53.211 --> 03:55:55.772]  Okay, going back to Max Keiser, right before we end the show.
[03:55:55.772 --> 03:55:59.933]  Max, specifically, you got linked up on Drudge, and it made national news in the U.S.
[03:55:59.933 --> 03:56:10.295]  when you made the point on international media that global currency is, that the establishment, some of them want, the bankers want a new level of the Ponzi scheme.
[03:56:10.295 --> 03:56:14.475]  You made the comment that the United States would not put up with that.
[03:56:14.475 --> 03:56:15.175]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:56:15.175 --> 03:56:16.896]  In other words, the U.S.
[03:56:16.896 --> 03:56:18.096]  dollar, the World Reserve currency,
[03:56:18.769 --> 03:56:21.610]  The IMF is mostly made up of dollars and the U.S.
[03:56:21.610 --> 03:56:24.611]  influenced those, the World Bank.
[03:56:24.611 --> 03:56:25.972]  The fact that the U.S.
[03:56:25.972 --> 03:56:37.277]  has a world reserve currency gives it an incredible advantage in global commerce because it can effectively buy things on credit and then when they have to pay out the credit, they just issue more currency.
[03:56:37.277 --> 03:56:39.638]  And that's the advantage of having a reserve currency.
[03:56:39.638 --> 03:56:42.699]  All other countries in the world, for example, if they want to buy oil,
[03:56:44.028 --> 03:56:51.973]  They first have to buy dollars, because oil is traded exclusively in dollars, gold is traded in dollars, and commodities are traded in dollars.
[03:56:51.973 --> 03:56:56.756]  So, if any other country, like Japan, wants to buy oil, they first have to buy dollars.
[03:56:56.756 --> 03:56:59.217]  And that's what gives incredible support to the dollar.
[03:56:59.217 --> 03:56:59.858]  And the U.S.
[03:56:59.858 --> 03:57:01.759]  gets a commission on every single dollar.
[03:57:01.759 --> 03:57:05.301]  You know, that's a huge business for these bankers, is the commission on dealing in dollars.
[03:57:05.301 --> 03:57:06.742]  So they don't want to get rid of that business.
[03:57:06.742 --> 03:57:08.783]  They don't want to share that business with anyone else.
[03:57:08.783 --> 03:57:11.205]  They don't want any other competing currencies.
[03:57:11.849 --> 03:57:17.791]  And, you know, when Iraq was going to start trading oil and euros, that's when the U.S.
[03:57:17.791 --> 03:57:19.512]  went in, shocking off!
[03:57:19.512 --> 03:57:27.175]  When Iran started talking about trading oil and gas and euros, oh, we're going to start saber-rattling against Iran!
[03:57:27.175 --> 03:57:39.479]  You know, and China is now saying, well, oh, we're going to start trading in something maybe other than dollars, and we're going to do all these bilateral deals, billions, tens of billions of dollars in bilateral deals in Africa using other currencies other than the dollar.
[03:57:40.217 --> 03:57:41.718]  And the question is, well, is the U.S.
[03:57:41.718 --> 03:57:47.723]  going to go in there and do some kind of military action in Beijing, like they've done in other countries?
[03:57:47.723 --> 03:58:00.472]  And although it may sound at first blush a bit extreme, if you think about a previous empire, which was England, when their counterparty, China, was not buying their goods,
[03:58:01.044 --> 03:58:05.187]  The English went in with their gunboats and started something called the Opium War.
[03:58:05.187 --> 03:58:10.470]  They got China hooked up on opium, addicted to opium, as a way to defend the British town.
[03:58:31.244 --> 03:58:32.665]  Okay.
[03:58:32.665 --> 03:58:33.626]  There goes Max Keiser.
[03:58:33.626 --> 03:58:34.766]  I'm Alex Jones signing off.
[03:58:34.766 --> 03:58:40.570]  For everybody else, again, the show is going to re-air on stations across the country, but if you're an internet listener, join us.
[03:58:40.570 --> 03:58:43.892]  We'll be right back in a minute at Infowars.com.
[03:58:43.892 --> 03:58:46.394]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[03:58:46.394 --> 03:58:48.675]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[03:58:51.752 --> 03:58:53.413]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[03:58:53.413 --> 03:58:58.175]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[03:58:58.175 --> 03:59:01.136]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[03:59:01.136 --> 03:59:04.177]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[03:59:04.177 --> 03:59:08.899]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[03:59:09.079 --> 03:59:09.559]  We're good to go.
[03:59:28.911 --> 03:59:35.153]  Visit efoodsdirect.com and look over the fine list of high-quality, pre-scribed, and dehydrated foods they have to offer.
[03:59:35.153 --> 03:59:38.774]  Watch the free videos, look at their online catalog, or give them a call at 1-800-409-5633.
[03:59:38.774 --> 03:59:40.295]  Again, 800-409-5633, or on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[03:59:40.295 --> 03:59:40.915]  Take action today.
[03:59:40.915 --> 03:59:42.736]  The first step is getting storable food.
[04:00:11.910 --> 04:00:16.473]  I am a shotgun rider for the San Jacinto Line.
[04:00:16.473 --> 04:00:20.615]  The desert is my brother, my skin is cracked and dry.
[04:00:20.615 --> 04:00:28.940]  I was riding on a cold coast and everything was fine, till we took a shorter road to save some time.
[04:00:28.940 --> 04:00:34.484]  Bandits only fired once, they shot me in the chest.
[04:00:35.862 --> 04:00:37.263]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[04:00:37.263 --> 04:00:37.583]  to 3 p.m.
[04:00:37.583 --> 04:00:38.404]  we're here live.
[04:00:38.404 --> 04:00:41.346]  But occasionally we go overboard into overdrive.
[04:00:41.346 --> 04:00:48.271]  A little bit more of the highwayman then we're gonna go back to Max Keiser joining us from Paris.
[04:01:06.334 --> 04:01:12.622]  But the captain bucked the sandbar, and an ace fell from my sleeve.
[04:01:12.622 --> 04:01:17.328]  They threw me overboard, and I swore I didn't cheat.
[04:01:17.328 --> 04:01:18.309]  But I could swim.
[04:01:23.039 --> 04:01:27.225]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we are back live.
[04:01:27.225 --> 04:01:29.929]  Thank you again for joining us.
[04:01:29.929 --> 04:01:39.322]  I had to have Max Keiser back on because there's so many issues that he brings up, you know, so many things he covers that are key and I appreciate him coming on with us during Overdrive.
[04:01:40.203 --> 04:01:42.526]  And going back to Max Keiser joining us from Paris.
[04:01:42.526 --> 04:01:44.289]  Okay, Max, continue breaking down.
[04:01:44.289 --> 04:01:46.071]  You got into the opium wars.
[04:01:46.071 --> 04:01:46.772]  Recap that.
[04:01:46.772 --> 04:01:56.725]  Explain how important a world reserve currency is and how the international bankers, based in the US and England, have been using this power to abuse everybody, take over the world.
[04:01:56.725 --> 04:01:57.786]  People are sick of it.
[04:01:58.767 --> 04:02:01.788]  But there's also a fissure, though, with inside the bankers.
[04:02:01.788 --> 04:02:09.229]  Some of them have been saying they want a new global currency, or one stacked on top of the dollar, because they've already whored out the dollar so bad.
[04:02:09.229 --> 04:02:12.990]  So, navigating this, where do you see this going?
[04:02:12.990 --> 04:02:27.073]  Yeah, well, first of all, you've been covering this idea of a global currency for quite some time, and you've had a lot of people on your show talking about it, and people have kind of pecked at it and looked at it and tried to come up with a story, and you've kept
[04:02:27.529 --> 04:02:37.559]  You've kept digging at it, and to your credit, because everybody else in the financial press has really been skirting and dodging this issue of a global currency.
[04:02:37.559 --> 04:02:46.528]  And lo and behold, you know, the Alex Jones Show is pretty much correct on this one, because we do now have a global currency, and it's called the credit default swap.
[04:02:46.528 --> 04:02:49.791]  The credit default swap is a unit of fraud.
[04:02:50.251 --> 04:02:50.852]  We're good to go.
[04:03:12.305 --> 04:03:13.446]  Outcomes and events.
[04:03:13.446 --> 04:03:17.468]  That's the global currency today, and the credit default swap is the unit of that currency.
[04:03:17.468 --> 04:03:18.548]  It is a global currency.
[04:03:18.548 --> 04:03:19.789]  It's happening right now.
[04:03:19.789 --> 04:03:36.517]  And when we talk about recapitalizing the IMF and bringing in special drawing rights and putting in a trillion dollars worth of additional funding, ultimately what that means is just rejiggering the books on all these big banks' balance sheets in terms of their credit default swap positions and how to take care of these positions and how to manage these positions.
[04:03:37.197 --> 04:03:42.282]  And we've gone from a fractional Reserve Banking System, Alex, to a negative Reserve Banking System.
[04:03:42.282 --> 04:03:45.185]  It's completely topsy-turvy and an inside-out.
[04:03:45.185 --> 04:03:48.548]  There is absolutely no there, there.
[04:03:48.548 --> 04:03:58.478]  If you go back to 2004, remember Greenspan convinced the SEC to allow banks to increase their debt-to-capital ratios from 12 to 1 to 30 to 1, which is a huge jump.
[04:04:01.886 --> 04:04:02.386]  I think so.
[04:04:20.999 --> 04:04:24.760]  It's a fictitious, it's what Thomas Jefferson called fictitious currency.
[04:04:24.760 --> 04:04:28.182]  It's just, it's a notational value in a book.
[04:04:28.182 --> 04:04:30.422]  There's absolutely nothing behind it.
[04:04:30.422 --> 04:04:34.664]  And ultimately what this means is that there's going to be no more competition.
[04:04:34.664 --> 04:04:47.568]  And when you have no more competition, when you have price fixing for the interest rates that are behind these fake currencies, you end up with a command and control economy, and you end up right back to where, you know, the Soviets were in the 1950s.
[04:04:47.568 --> 04:04:48.388]  No competition.
[04:04:50.189 --> 04:04:56.797]  Command and control, price fixing, and indebtedness, and indentured servitude.
[04:04:56.797 --> 04:05:04.427]  And this is all, unfortunately the outcome of this is that competition, that phrase is understood in America, is going to die.
[04:05:05.970 --> 04:05:14.097]  Well, one of the British members of the European Parliament, this Hannon gentleman, he brought up the point to Gordon Brown a few weeks ago.
[04:05:14.097 --> 04:05:29.329]  He said, you can repeat in that wooden aporagic, like somebody from the Soviet era, that everything's fine as you spend, you know, hundreds of billions more a month into the maw of the private banks, but reality, you know, is going to basically overthrow you.
[04:05:29.329 --> 04:05:30.891]  And so where do you see this going?
[04:05:30.891 --> 04:05:33.473]  I mean, the bankers are acting like they're the saviors.
[04:05:34.113 --> 04:05:34.974]  Yeah, that's basically true.
[04:05:34.974 --> 04:05:39.998]  I mean, I take the long view, which is that if you go back to the 1350 period,
[04:05:57.065 --> 04:06:11.095]  You know, during the feudalism, the only thing that gave rise to the middle class, the only thing that gave rise to the ability of non-nobility to negotiate a wage was the Black Plague in Europe, which wiped out virtually half the population.
[04:06:11.095 --> 04:06:20.741]  It was after they wiped out half the population in Europe that you had the rise of the middle class, because all these lords needed now people to work on their estate, and they were willing to pay them a wage.
[04:06:20.741 --> 04:06:22.903]  That was the beginning of what we call the middle classes.
[04:06:23.383 --> 04:06:28.305]  This has been going on, but the nobility wanted, was happy about this.
[04:06:28.305 --> 04:06:30.106]  They're back and forth.
[04:06:30.106 --> 04:06:33.127]  The aristocrats and the nobility want everything back.
[04:06:33.127 --> 04:06:34.508]  They don't want a middle class.
[04:06:34.508 --> 04:06:36.909]  They don't want people with the social mobility.
[04:06:36.909 --> 04:06:38.289]  They don't want democracy.
[04:06:38.289 --> 04:06:40.070]  It's inconvenient for them.
[04:06:40.070 --> 04:06:52.135]  You know, in 1649, as I mentioned earlier, there was this idea, well, we got rid of the divine right of kings, which led then to 1694, the aristocracy came back with, let's introduce the Bank of England.
[04:06:52.941 --> 04:07:02.087]  Which is put in place by the aristocrats in England to re-establish the place of the aristocrats after they had lost the battle of 1649.
[04:07:02.087 --> 04:07:10.093]  Then you had, of course, you had the French Revolution, the American Revolution, and you had the history since then.
[04:07:10.093 --> 04:07:14.336]  We're at a period in time now where you've got this idea of the divine right of hedge funds.
[04:07:14.336 --> 04:07:18.399]  They believe that they're above, they're literally God's gift to planet Earth.
[04:07:18.399 --> 04:07:21.361]  They're completely above any law, and they're just
[04:07:22.121 --> 04:07:24.343]  Their value of money is what they say it is.
[04:07:24.343 --> 04:07:30.887]  You know, like, we hear stories about in the old medieval days, how many angels could dance on the head of a pin with an argument by priests.
[04:07:30.887 --> 04:07:36.971]  Now we've got Tim Geiger and the Hedge Fund saying, well, how many credit default swaps can dance on the head of this coin with collateralized debt obligation?
[04:07:36.971 --> 04:07:37.871]  It's all nonsense!
[04:07:37.871 --> 04:07:39.913]  They're just talking out of their butthole!
[04:07:39.913 --> 04:07:42.114]  There's no value there at all!
[04:07:42.114 --> 04:07:46.717]  They're just creating a total fictitious, what I call a financial hologram.
[04:07:47.435 --> 04:07:53.777]  It's just flickering images in the context of somebody's ledger, but there's nothing there.
[04:07:53.777 --> 04:07:55.858]  Unemployment is skyrocketing in America.
[04:07:55.858 --> 04:07:57.798]  There's no benefits left in America.
[04:07:57.798 --> 04:07:59.459]  People don't have any net worth.
[04:07:59.459 --> 04:08:01.499]  Their houses have been eviscerated.
[04:08:01.499 --> 04:08:03.100]  Well, where's the value?
[04:08:03.100 --> 04:08:04.680]  Where's people's wealth?
[04:08:04.680 --> 04:08:05.921]  What happened to it?
[04:08:05.921 --> 04:08:07.321]  It's been stolen.
[04:08:07.321 --> 04:08:10.402]  That's what happened to it.
[04:08:10.402 --> 04:08:11.543]  Absolutely.
[04:08:11.543 --> 04:08:15.684]  Max Keiser, specifically, we're getting into Obama.
[04:08:18.602 --> 04:08:18.702]  Yes.
[04:08:48.602 --> 04:08:51.645]  How do you see that unfolding?
[04:08:51.645 --> 04:09:00.632]  I guess I'm lucky because I live in France, I live in Europe, and I'm a little bit one or two steps removed from the Obama phenomenon.
[04:09:00.632 --> 04:09:06.938]  But you see him on TV for five minutes and he's an extraordinarily gifted guy in terms of his charisma.
[04:09:07.778 --> 04:09:12.020]  And, um, so it's difficult to peel yourself away from that.
[04:09:12.020 --> 04:09:31.467]  But, if you just look at the numbers, and what's going on, as I mentioned with that case with UBS and all these banks, and the wholesale pilfering that's going on, you gotta say, you know, that guy might be a beautiful politician, but I'm starving to death, you know, I gotta, I'm living in a tent!
[04:09:31.467 --> 04:09:35.309]  I can't, uh, you know, I mean, this isn't a film, this is my life!
[04:09:36.424 --> 04:09:48.151]  And they've got to understand that there's the real consequences to this financial oligarchy that's been left allowed to run amok.
[04:09:48.151 --> 04:09:52.913]  And I still think that some kind of civil disobedience has got to be the way to go.
[04:09:52.913 --> 04:10:02.699]  I mean, obviously, the black community in America figured out that civil disobedience was the way to engineer some rights for themselves, and it worked out pretty well.
[04:10:02.699 --> 04:10:04.260]  They've got a black president, fantastic!
[04:10:04.941 --> 04:10:16.810]  And now, what about community America as a whole doing some kind of collective civil disobedience to put pressure on this banking oligarchy to shift the balance of wealth back?
[04:10:16.810 --> 04:10:24.436]  You know, Alex, all that money that was given to the banks, they could have very easily just wiped every credit card debit balance clean in America.
[04:10:24.436 --> 04:10:29.700]  It would have cost less money, people would have started spending immediately, and the economy would already be growing.
[04:10:29.700 --> 04:10:31.121]  What would happen if it was growing?
[04:10:31.121 --> 04:10:34.524]  Then the banks, to deal with the growth
[04:10:35.000 --> 04:10:35.480]  We're good to go.
[04:10:58.758 --> 04:11:02.060]  And that's not... banks don't like that.
[04:11:02.060 --> 04:11:06.283]  The neo-feudal banking class doesn't want higher interest rates.
[04:11:06.283 --> 04:11:08.764]  They want people making a return on their savings.
[04:11:08.764 --> 04:11:14.308]  Max Keiser, any way you cut it then, and you write for the Huffington Post and you tried to be a supporter of Obama.
[04:11:14.308 --> 04:11:18.571]  I mean, Bush was terrible and we would have thought he should have helped.
[04:11:18.571 --> 04:11:26.896]  I mean, bottom line, you're saying clearly after watching him several months in power and who he put in power and what he's doing, who does Obama work for and where is he taking the country?
[04:11:28.516 --> 04:11:30.116]  The numbers speak for themselves.
[04:11:30.116 --> 04:11:40.799]  I don't see, as long as Summers and Geithner are in the jobs that they're currently in, there's going to be no change, no progress.
[04:11:40.799 --> 04:11:48.640]  And when President Obama talks about, you know, we're getting a handle on this crisis and we're going to make sure we don't repeat it again.
[04:11:48.640 --> 04:11:51.361]  The crisis hasn't even really started yet.
[04:11:51.761 --> 04:11:58.766]  Because the real crisis begins when all these bailouts turn out to be that they don't work.
[04:11:58.766 --> 04:12:04.809]  Even today, the banks reported that we need another round of bailouts because all the bailouts so far didn't work.
[04:12:04.809 --> 04:12:06.250]  All the bank stocks were down again.
[04:12:06.250 --> 04:12:12.254]  And at the other side of this is going to be a tsunami of inflation.
[04:12:12.254 --> 04:12:14.015]  And that's the crisis.
[04:12:14.015 --> 04:12:14.776]  That's the crisis.
[04:12:14.776 --> 04:12:15.836]  This is just a warm-up.
[04:12:15.836 --> 04:12:16.677]  This is just a warm-up.
[04:12:17.591 --> 04:12:19.733]  Well, I mean, absolutely, you're right about that.
[04:12:19.733 --> 04:12:21.475]  Look, the establishment isn't stupid.
[04:12:21.475 --> 04:12:26.521]  You talk about this imperial hubris, you know, the bankers engaging in all this looting and corruption.
[04:12:26.521 --> 04:12:27.201]  They know!
[04:12:27.201 --> 04:12:29.203]  That's why they're militarizing police.
[04:12:29.203 --> 04:12:33.128]  That's why they're saying we're going to use 20,000 armed troops on the streets of America.
[04:12:33.128 --> 04:12:35.910]  That's why the Army War College says they're getting ready to engage the people.
[04:12:36.491 --> 04:12:37.952]  But that's even more crazy.
[04:12:37.952 --> 04:12:48.237]  The bankers think they can just, just like Argentina, like you said, talk more about that, totally destroy everything financially and then just use militarized police to suppress us?
[04:12:48.237 --> 04:12:57.763]  I mean, this is hellish, but I guess they don't care everything's ruined as long as they're the top dogs sitting on top of the pile of shit, for lack of a better term.
[04:12:57.763 --> 04:13:03.926]  So break that down along the lines of the engineered collapse of Argentina and where you see this going here.
[04:13:04.532 --> 04:13:11.797]  Yeah, the Argentina example is fantastic, and as I said before, it's called Argentina Collapse, a 12-part YouTube series, so it's about 120 minutes or so.
[04:13:13.539 --> 04:13:20.723]  It's a document film, and it lays out the timeline.
[04:13:20.723 --> 04:13:25.686]  So what's remarkable about that film is you can pretty well figure out where America is on the timeline.
[04:13:25.686 --> 04:13:40.235]  And right now, America seems to be on around the 2000-2001 period, when the banks and the politicians and the legal system basically just pulls up the drawbridge and says, you're on your own.
[04:13:40.235 --> 04:13:42.016]  And the people are on the street banging pots,
[04:13:43.038 --> 04:13:47.681]  They closed the banks, they closed access to the banks, and they're just starving in the streets.
[04:13:47.681 --> 04:13:52.284]  And the guys are in the castle, they pulled up the drawbridge, and they're partying.
[04:13:52.284 --> 04:13:54.606]  And that's kind of like the timeline we're on.
[04:13:54.606 --> 04:13:58.108]  And who was orchestrating the Argentina nightmare?
[04:13:58.108 --> 04:14:00.109]  Oh, it's the IMF!
[04:14:00.109 --> 04:14:02.111]  Who's in charge of bailing out the world now?
[04:14:02.111 --> 04:14:03.672]  Oh, it's the IMF!
[04:14:03.672 --> 04:14:06.313]  It's the same group of people!
[04:14:06.313 --> 04:14:08.375]  And they're gonna do the same austerity measures!
[04:14:09.244 --> 04:14:10.444]  On the U.S.
[04:14:10.444 --> 04:14:14.946]  They're treating America like the Citibank treated Latin America in the 1980s.
[04:14:14.946 --> 04:14:17.247]  Who do they think they are?
[04:14:17.247 --> 04:14:19.928]  But more than that, I want you to speak to this, Max.
[04:14:19.928 --> 04:14:36.193]  They're going to raise the drawbridge up, let us rot for six months to a year to teach us, and then they'll let a little bit of loans back in, and they'll pose as the savior, doling out more fiat currency backed by taxpayers, and the middle class is going to be gone.
[04:14:36.906 --> 04:14:37.486]  Yeah, exactly.
[04:14:37.486 --> 04:14:39.048]  Well, they'll bill it out again.
[04:14:39.048 --> 04:14:42.650]  Interest rates are the fulcrum upon which all these things are balanced.
[04:14:42.650 --> 04:14:47.734]  So, if you're a friend of the people on the other side of that drawbridge, you get a low rate.
[04:14:47.734 --> 04:14:50.455]  Like, for example, the hedge fund community right now.
[04:14:50.455 --> 04:14:54.878]  Geithner said to the hedge fund community, we want you to buy some of our toxic debts.
[04:14:54.878 --> 04:14:59.181]  And to do it, we're going to lend you money at virtually zero interest rate.
[04:14:59.181 --> 04:15:02.604]  And if it doesn't work out, you don't lose money, we're going to bail you out again.
[04:15:04.113 --> 04:15:05.554]  Gee, that's a nice deal!
[04:15:05.554 --> 04:15:07.036]  Where do I get that deal?
[04:15:07.036 --> 04:15:11.740]  You're gonna lend me money at 0% interest to buy what you call the toxic debt.
[04:15:11.740 --> 04:15:15.403]  If I lose any money, you're gonna make me whole again.
[04:15:15.403 --> 04:15:18.125]  That's the deal the government's offering the hedge fund community.
[04:15:18.125 --> 04:15:25.932]  It's just like me going into Las Vegas and pulling the slot machine, and anytime it doesn't come up a winner, the casino pays out triple.
[04:15:26.772 --> 04:15:29.855]  What would you say to the police and military listening?
[04:15:29.855 --> 04:15:33.058]  I mean, they really have the same interest of the American people.
[04:15:33.058 --> 04:15:35.340]  They're all having their future destroyed as well.
[04:15:38.119 --> 04:15:50.727]  Comment on that, and then secondarily, what about having state grand juries, federal grand juries, go after more of these made-offs, more of these bankers that have committed all these crimes, and start bringing these arrogant bastards to justice?
[04:15:50.727 --> 04:15:57.191]  Then we can, you know, get rid of their system and bring back liberty and freedom and transparency and the rule of law.
[04:15:57.191 --> 04:15:58.832]  I mean, it's either us or them.
[04:15:58.832 --> 04:16:04.936]  If we keep letting them grandstand as the saviors for the crisis they created, there's no end in sight.
[04:16:06.451 --> 04:16:15.660]  Well, you know, the police and the military, they're in a horrible position because, first of all, you know, as a society we need police, we need military.
[04:16:17.672 --> 04:16:20.213]  So they are just stuck in a horrible position.
[04:16:20.213 --> 04:16:25.775]  If you use the Argentina timeline, what happens is eventually at the end, they side with the people.
[04:16:25.775 --> 04:16:30.977]  Remember in the Chavez coup, that was proven to be a plot of the U.S.
[04:16:30.977 --> 04:16:33.678]  The military eventually sided with the people.
[04:16:33.678 --> 04:16:37.579]  So they're the last ones to flip, unfortunately, because they're in the worst position.
[04:16:38.467 --> 04:16:43.720]  Um, but eventually they do flip, but by then the situation is quite bad.
[04:16:43.720 --> 04:16:45.324]  How do you go after these people?
[04:16:45.324 --> 04:16:46.687]  You know, if you go back to the 1980s...
[04:16:48.081 --> 04:16:54.404]  With Michael Milken, and the director of Burnham-Lambert, which was at that time the biggest fraud in Walsh's history.
[04:16:54.404 --> 04:17:03.348]  Ultimately, I think it was Rudy Giuliani, who was the prosecutor at the time in New York, they had to go and use RICO, anti-racketeering.
[04:17:03.348 --> 04:17:15.793]  And that's the only way you're going to get at these guys, because the rating agencies like Moody's and S&P, who gave these bonds AAA rating fraudulently, the investment banks that recommended them, and everyone involved in this racket,
[04:17:16.400 --> 04:17:19.803]  And this conspiracy has to be prosecuted simultaneously under RICO.
[04:17:19.803 --> 04:17:31.211]  Because if you go after one at a time, then they just move the game to a new venue, they move the game to a new security, now it's a new credit default swap, now it's a synthetic credit default swap, now it's an inverted yield credit default out-of-the-money put spread.
[04:17:31.211 --> 04:17:36.896]  They just keep making up new securities as they go along, and it's impossible to track them down.
[04:17:37.356 --> 04:17:39.599]  So what Giuliani figured out was Rico.
[04:17:39.599 --> 04:17:41.542]  We're going to go after them as a racket.
[04:17:41.542 --> 04:17:45.808]  And they took down Drexel, they took down Ivan Boski, and they took down Michael Milken.
[04:17:45.808 --> 04:17:49.413]  To take down Geithner and these guys, they've got to go after them using Rico.
[04:17:50.495 --> 04:17:53.456]  But now it's a thousand times worse.
[04:17:53.456 --> 04:17:55.417]  Now they've premeditatedly thought about this.
[04:17:55.417 --> 04:18:03.260]  They're leveraging it to the global level and they're saying we're going to set up a new bank of the world that you pay your taxes to.
[04:18:03.260 --> 04:18:14.424]  I mean, I guess they've got to go for broke because if they don't go for broke and get the power, get the tyranny, I mean, what I'm saying is they've got to have the tyranny in place just to protect themselves from all their previous crimes.
[04:18:15.524 --> 04:18:20.246]  Again, the Argentina timeline and methodology, it's a great film.
[04:18:20.246 --> 04:18:22.847]  If you haven't seen it or haven't seen it recently, check it out again.
[04:18:22.847 --> 04:18:36.313]  The way that, basically, what happens is the legal system, the judges and the judiciary, it gets into play and the highest courts in the land start to rewrite laws.
[04:18:36.313 --> 04:18:42.416]  I would imagine that as the banking crisis gets worse and worse, we're going to see some new laws.
[04:18:43.577 --> 04:18:46.560]  Which are going to be sweeping.
[04:18:46.560 --> 04:18:58.831]  Remember that when the lawsuits against the telecom companies for illegally spying on people, they just basically swept all those suits under the rug in one draft of a pen.
[04:18:58.831 --> 04:19:04.617]  So ultimately when it becomes clear that the banking system is sitting on hundreds of trillions of dollars worth of
[04:19:05.277 --> 04:19:08.319]  Of fraudulent counterfeit paper.
[04:19:08.319 --> 04:19:14.684]  Then we're going to start, we're going to see, they're going to say, okay, we're going to bring in this new global banking system.
[04:19:14.684 --> 04:19:15.104]  The U.S.
[04:19:15.104 --> 04:19:16.525]  dollar is now gone.
[04:19:16.525 --> 04:19:22.650]  It's being replaced with another unit of currency that is tied into these other units of currency.
[04:19:22.650 --> 04:19:28.054]  And it'll be devalued quite sharply, of course, and that'll be the hyperinflation.
[04:19:28.354 --> 04:19:32.079]  So anything that costs you $5 today will cost you $10 or $15 in one day.
[04:19:32.079 --> 04:19:33.561]  It'll happen in one day.
[04:19:33.561 --> 04:19:35.003]  And we saw this in the 30s.
[04:19:35.003 --> 04:19:37.766]  Price of gold in the dollar was a devaluation.
[04:19:37.766 --> 04:19:42.232]  And in one day, those two things, the price changed dramatically in one day.
[04:19:42.232 --> 04:19:43.614]  So you'll see this happening.
[04:19:44.054 --> 04:19:46.216]  And they're gonna loot what's left of the middle class.
[04:19:46.216 --> 04:19:47.477]  They're already admitting it.
[04:19:47.477 --> 04:19:53.622]  Changing the whole tax code, getting rid of mortgage exemptions, education exemptions.
[04:19:53.622 --> 04:19:57.746]  So Obama lied about that, saying nobody over 125,000 a year are couples of 250.
[04:19:57.746 --> 04:20:02.990]  New York State's passed something like 88 new taxes.
[04:20:02.990 --> 04:20:06.213]  I mean, my God, these people are getting ready to completely gang-rape us!
[04:20:07.358 --> 04:20:10.501]  Well, like we're saying, the middle class is an inconvenience.
[04:20:10.501 --> 04:20:25.113]  An inconvenience for the people who want more of the... You know, like in Nantucket, you know, if somebody in the middle class builds a house in front of your house, and you're like Carl Icahn in Nantucket, and some iridescent builds a house in front of yours, that's quite upsetting.
[04:20:25.113 --> 04:20:28.396]  So you'll do whatever you need to do to get rid of this middle class.
[04:20:28.396 --> 04:20:29.957]  This thing called the middle class.
[04:20:29.957 --> 04:20:30.698]  It's in my way!
[04:20:31.494 --> 04:20:33.215]  And this is the mentality.
[04:20:33.215 --> 04:20:34.295]  And the U.S.
[04:20:34.295 --> 04:20:36.696]  was formed as an escape from the Bank of England.
[04:20:36.696 --> 04:20:46.080]  Benjamin Franklin said, one of the reasons that we started the America to begin with was to escape the pernicious claws of the Bank of England and the usury that came with it.
[04:20:46.080 --> 04:20:52.663]  Well, that lasted for a while, then the U.S., the same people who brought the Bank of England started the Federal Reserve Bank in 1913.
[04:20:52.663 --> 04:21:00.887]  And that was, you know, a horrible event in terms of America's quest to be independent of a usurious central banking system.
[04:21:02.110 --> 04:21:09.612]  That is, as you would say, a parasite, and it hasn't contributed to growth whatsoever.
[04:21:09.612 --> 04:21:27.877]  But as far as, you know, pointing a finger at Obama, you know, the thing is, ultimately, the people in the United States are going to have to figure out... You know, one of the horrible tragedies of all these security checkpoints and all these police and militarization is that neighbor begins to distrust neighbor.
[04:21:28.780 --> 04:21:32.085]  And people are really paranoid and people are really afraid of each other.
[04:21:32.085 --> 04:21:35.349]  And that's exactly placed into the hands of the people who are confiscating the wealth.
[04:21:36.047 --> 04:21:40.810]  You know, any solution is going to require cooperation and community cooperation.
[04:21:40.810 --> 04:21:42.872]  And that's going to happen.
[04:21:42.872 --> 04:21:47.355]  That's why in the Constitution and the Bill of Rights, there's a right to assemble.
[04:21:47.355 --> 04:21:55.801]  Well, even the right to assemble is being destroyed because you've got checkpoints, you've got militarization, you've got CCTV cameras, you've got spies everywhere.
[04:21:55.801 --> 04:21:57.222]  We can't even assemble.
[04:21:57.222 --> 04:21:59.843]  We can't even have a meeting to decide what we want to do.
[04:21:59.843 --> 04:22:03.066]  And we look at the Alex Jones Show, and Alex Jones is
[04:22:04.338 --> 04:22:12.846]  You know, trying to get as much information as you possibly can within an information universe that, for the most part, is completely controlled by a corporate agenda.
[04:22:13.314 --> 04:22:16.996]  Yeah, and now, Max, I'm really getting demonized by the left and the right.
[04:22:16.996 --> 04:22:18.898]  They are really coming after me.
[04:22:18.898 --> 04:22:21.879]  They got COINTELPRO, low-level, high-level people.
[04:22:21.879 --> 04:22:23.100]  It's starting to get scary.
[04:22:23.100 --> 04:22:27.263]  I mean, I know I signed on to this and I'm going in through and beyond, just like you are.
[04:22:27.263 --> 04:22:32.926]  But the good news is, as things get worse and worse, more people are listening and joining us and standing beside us.
[04:22:32.926 --> 04:22:35.328]  And I hope folks will visit MaxKaiser.com.
[04:22:35.328 --> 04:22:37.810]  Tell folks about the Oracle and how they can watch that on the BBC.
[04:22:39.150 --> 04:22:57.189]  Right, well, the Oracle on BBC World News, Season 1 is done, finished, we're working on Season 2, but we're working to move the show over to one of the terrestrial channels in the UK, because nobody in the UK can see the show, because nobody in the UK gets satellite TV.
[04:22:57.189 --> 04:23:00.753]  They get BBC 1, 2, 3, and 4, but they don't get BBC World News.
[04:23:01.053 --> 04:23:07.680]  So we're trying to move the show from BBC World News to BBC 4 or BBC 3 so that people in the UK can actually see the show.
[04:23:07.680 --> 04:23:09.922]  And I'm getting emails every day.
[04:23:09.922 --> 04:23:14.267]  And to that end, I get emails every day, people saying, get Alex Jones on the show.
[04:23:14.267 --> 04:23:15.989]  By far the most requested guest.
[04:23:16.724 --> 04:23:19.547]  From emails I get every day, it's for Alex Jones.
[04:23:19.547 --> 04:23:25.131]  So, when we move this show to a terrestrial station, or we get a deal in the U.S.
[04:23:25.131 --> 04:23:30.916]  on a cable network, either Showtime or HBO, then, you know, we'll have the Alex Jones.
[04:23:30.916 --> 04:23:36.201]  I think the Alex Jones message, part of the reason you're having difficulty right now is because you're regional.
[04:23:36.201 --> 04:23:37.382]  You're in the U.S.
[04:23:37.382 --> 04:23:42.487]  You gotta go global, because your message should go global, because this is a global
[04:23:43.087 --> 04:23:44.407]  This is a global problem.
[04:24:03.373 --> 04:24:07.838]  Everyone's out to get them, there's an existential threat, there's a boogeyman under every coffee table.
[04:24:07.838 --> 04:24:08.598]  It's just not true!
[04:24:08.598 --> 04:24:14.985]  You know, it's all, if your economy is based on over-consumption and militarization, you're gonna get people to eat donuts and buy guns!
[04:24:15.529 --> 04:24:19.693]  Well, folks should visit MaxKaiser.com, find out about your radio show and everything you do.
[04:24:19.693 --> 04:24:22.455]  You're gracious enough to come on for an hour and 15-20 minutes today.
[04:24:22.455 --> 04:24:29.241]  You're going to be on with Jason Bermas Wednesday night, and the first hour, 9 o'clock central, so folks should tune into that.
[04:24:29.241 --> 04:24:34.405]  Max Kaiser, I really appreciate you coming on with us, and we'll talk to you very, very soon, my friend.
[04:24:34.405 --> 04:24:35.166]  Alright, Alex.
[04:24:36.530 --> 04:24:38.211]  There he goes, Max Keiser.
[04:24:38.211 --> 04:24:40.573]  Okay, we're going to go ahead and go into rebroadcast now.
[04:24:40.573 --> 04:24:45.137]  I'll also do the breakdown of the FEMA camps coming up, and a lot more.
[04:24:45.137 --> 04:24:50.001]  So please stay with us in the restreams and spread the word about the show.
[04:24:50.001 --> 04:24:51.702]  We're not risking our lives for nothing.
[04:24:51.702 --> 04:24:53.144]  Let's go in through and beyond.
[04:24:53.144 --> 04:24:55.626]  Let's defeat the New World Order together.
[04:24:55.626 --> 04:24:56.687]  Great job of the crew.
[04:24:56.687 --> 04:25:00.490]  I want to commend Jaron and Paul, particularly today.
[04:25:00.490 --> 04:25:03.172]  Off the chart, it's a badass job.
[04:25:03.172 --> 04:25:04.933]  And all of you, great job as well.
[04:25:05.954 --> 04:25:10.279]  I'm enjoying being demonized by the ADL now and all over the newspapers everywhere.
[04:25:10.279 --> 04:25:12.000]  But that comes with the territory.
[04:25:12.000 --> 04:25:14.102]  When you're over the target, you're going to be getting the flack.
[04:25:14.102 --> 04:25:18.367]  And like I said, we're going in, through, and beyond.
[04:25:18.367 --> 04:25:19.188]  God bless you all.
