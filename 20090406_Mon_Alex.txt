[00:00.000 --> 00:11.480]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.480 --> 00:19.040]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin

[00:49.480 --> 00:59.920]  have Max Kaiser BBC host top-stop broker economists joining us coming up in the
[00:59.920 --> 01:06.120]  final hour today I had Michael Bagnaric set up for the show I was gonna do my
[01:06.120 --> 01:11.480]  big FEMA camp expose last Friday but I had some issues come up where I had to
[01:11.480 --> 01:16.440]  take off and so Burma sat in so I wasn't here and so I have to do the FEMA
[01:16.440 --> 01:22.840]  camp analysis today just hours ahead of Glenn Beck schedule debunking and so
[01:22.840 --> 01:26.200]  we're gonna move Bagnaric to later in the week I apologize to Michael Bagnaric
[01:26.200 --> 01:30.760]  constitutional scholar good friend of mine great to political mind he will be
[01:30.760 --> 01:34.280]  joining us coming up later in the week if he can move if he can do it I'm sure
[01:34.280 --> 01:41.120]  he probably can so that is coming up today Max Kaiser will be in the final
[01:41.120 --> 01:46.680]  hour always informative goes on the international television and says the
[01:46.680 --> 01:52.120]  economy was destroyed in a controlled demolition just like the World Trade
[01:52.120 --> 01:57.720]  Center towers has a lot of courage and has a once a week show called the
[01:57.720 --> 02:07.840]  article on the BBC so that is coming up later in this transmission okay this is
[02:07.840 --> 02:12.960]  what's gonna happen I'm gonna cover a host of important news for the next hour
[02:12.960 --> 02:24.680]  and eight minutes and then I'm gonna do about an hour and 52 minutes on the
[02:24.680 --> 02:32.440]  reality of the FEMA camps now here's the problem I went back through my research
[02:32.440 --> 02:41.320]  this weekend and literally printed 200 plus mainstream news articles bills
[02:41.320 --> 02:49.760]  legislation Pentagon statements and got in this morning a few hours early but
[02:49.760 --> 02:54.280]  my board ops come in right at about 11 because they also come back at night and
[02:54.280 --> 02:57.120]  run Burma's a show they're really not just board ops they direct the TV show
[02:57.120 --> 03:02.400]  they're TV producer slash directors I guess you're calling Paul Hartman and
[03:02.400 --> 03:09.000]  Sharon Nyhard so they're in there right now trying to pull up 200 plus news
[03:09.000 --> 03:15.360]  articles video clips in the folders in the order I just gave them to so they're
[03:15.360 --> 03:20.320]  in a race to get all this loaded on the computer the articles the documents the
[03:20.320 --> 03:24.840]  Miami Herald from the 80s the you know the list goes on and on video clips of
[03:24.840 --> 03:31.520]  FEMA camps troops training to confiscate your guns and so we're racing to get all
[03:31.520 --> 03:41.680]  of this loaded in now the guys jaren and Paul work on the Sunday show too so
[03:41.680 --> 03:46.400]  they really only only get one day off with their families I guess I could have
[03:46.400 --> 03:51.560]  drug them in here last night to properly load all this in but the issue is
[03:51.560 --> 03:56.800]  there's just so much evidence so many documents so many things to cover so many
[03:56.800 --> 04:03.480]  pieces of evidence to go over that it takes three or four of us days and days
[04:03.480 --> 04:08.760]  and days just to prepare to try to put all this evidence on every piece of it
[04:08.760 --> 04:17.480]  is open and shut absolute admissions proof of giant FEMA camps everywhere and
[04:17.480 --> 04:24.720]  all of the news that ties into that the fact of this country is under martial
[04:24.720 --> 04:31.560]  law the fact that this nation has been taken over by the military industrial
[04:31.560 --> 04:39.560]  complex that's all there so that's coming up in about an hour from now in the
[04:39.560 --> 04:47.040]  meantime Italian earthquake 92 dead 50,000 homeless and the scientists that
[04:47.040 --> 04:54.040]  warned that it was coming with his data was muzzled by the government will also
[04:54.040 --> 05:01.240]  get into these mass shootings happening all over the place stay with us more
[05:01.240 --> 05:05.400]  than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water and did you know that
[05:05.400 --> 05:08.800]  you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than
[05:08.800 --> 05:12.360]  when drinking the water that's because many chemicals are inhaled when they
[05:12.360 --> 05:17.320]  evaporate and others are absorbed into the skin the KDF dual media shower filter
[05:17.320 --> 05:21.080]  works with both hot and cold water and it's designed to reduce chlorine lead

[07:25.080 --> 07:28.200]  waiting for a cop to show up after a crime is better than defending yourself

[08:12.240 --> 08:19.880]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[08:19.880 --> 08:23.240]  Alex Jones
[08:40.240 --> 08:45.960]  at least 92 people are dead and 50,000 homeless in a earthquake which has
[08:45.960 --> 08:50.800]  flattened parts of central Italy Reuters is reporting that the geologist in
[08:50.800 --> 08:54.680]  Italy who warned the government that the quake was coming and even pick the
[08:54.680 --> 09:01.360]  date was muzzled by the government and told to shut up so a real tragedy there
[09:01.360 --> 09:06.480]  but that's what happens living on this planet analysts say North Korean rocket
[09:06.480 --> 09:11.160]  not a total failure North Korea's rocket may have fallen into the sea but
[09:11.160 --> 09:14.480]  military experts caution Monday against calling it a complete failure
[09:14.480 --> 09:18.840]  nothing noting that it traveled twice as far as any missile the country has
[09:18.840 --> 09:24.680]  launched so far well that's not true they fired one that hit Alaska what seven
[09:24.680 --> 09:29.240]  years ago according to the Anchorage newspapers and others but that was kept
[09:29.240 --> 09:32.400]  quiet because they didn't want to hype that up although the distance was still
[09:32.400 --> 09:45.080]  far from reaching US territory it rattled the globe with the US and what
[09:45.080 --> 09:48.360]  happened here with this article is I was wondering why I was reading this and in
[09:48.360 --> 09:54.720]  the AP article got cut off here so I keep trying to read it and it's cut off
[09:54.720 --> 09:58.880]  because it put a little pop-up window there up over the story I was looking at
[09:58.880 --> 10:04.480]  going what is that now I understand the launch which demonstrated progress is
[10:04.480 --> 10:10.480]  a particularly worrying development for a beleaguered country that says it has
[10:10.480 --> 10:16.760]  nuclear weapons and once threatened to turn seol into a sea of fire well it's
[10:16.760 --> 10:23.600]  a pathetic country run by a psychopathic dictator what do you expect from him I
[10:23.600 --> 10:28.760]  mean this is what they do this is what the state turns into when the government
[10:28.760 --> 10:33.720]  claims that the state is God and the state owns everyone and this is the path
[10:33.720 --> 10:38.960]  that the United States and the rest of the world are marching on inside the
[10:38.960 --> 10:46.280]  new world order system this is what Barack Obama is setting up this is what
[10:46.280 --> 10:56.440]  the control freaks that run the globalist system are doing so we'll be
[10:56.440 --> 11:01.640]  getting more into that report today as well a lot of economic news is coming
[11:01.640 --> 11:07.240]  in and it's not pretty we know the federal government cooks the unemployment
[11:07.240 --> 11:11.160]  numbers they've been claiming that unemployment was at eight or nine
[11:11.160 --> 11:16.480]  percent the last year but they don't count you as unemployed if you've gone
[11:16.480 --> 11:21.440]  off the unemployment rolls so that number is a fairy tale but even their
[11:21.440 --> 11:29.320]  fairytale numbers are now saying that it's gone above 15 percent which is just
[11:29.320 --> 11:35.080]  a massive massive unemployment
[11:41.560 --> 11:45.960]  meanwhile what is Ben Bernanke saying well they want to continue to drive down
[11:45.960 --> 11:49.400]  confidence and freak everybody out so they can bankrupt the economy and
[11:49.400 --> 11:54.680]  consolidate it during the fire sale this is from Bloomberg financial Bernanke
[11:54.680 --> 12:03.560]  says green shoots may signal false spring amid job losses and so he's
[12:03.560 --> 12:07.880]  saying hey you know there's a few good economic numbers coming in but don't
[12:07.880 --> 12:12.920]  look at those look at the job losses this is a false spring and we may have
[12:12.920 --> 12:18.200]  another hard freeze that kills the economy again it will be months before
[12:18.200 --> 12:23.440]  it's clear whether what federal reserve chairman been as Bernanke calls the U.S.
[12:23.440 --> 12:29.200]  economies green shoots represents the early onset of recovery or a false
[12:29.200 --> 12:34.400]  spring and it goes on to report that April 3rd report that the economy shed
[12:34.400 --> 12:42.240]  an additional 663,000 jobs and then it will be followed by months more of bad
[12:42.240 --> 12:48.200]  news headlines economists say the recession now and its 17th month has
[12:48.200 --> 12:54.480]  already cost 5.1 million Americans their jobs the worst drop in post-war era
[12:54.480 --> 13:00.440]  unemployment may hit 9.4% this year according to the mainstream estimate in
[13:00.440 --> 13:09.120]  Bloomberg news survey and may top out above 10% in 2010 oh really I saw the
[13:09.120 --> 13:15.840]  headline yesterday of it's really above 15% the risk is that jobs pitchers turns
[13:15.840 --> 13:21.280]  even more bleak than the forecast on the drumbeat of bad news still to come
[13:21.280 --> 13:28.720]  causes consumers who spending has firmed up in recent months to hunker down again
[13:28.720 --> 13:32.960]  if something happens to spook consumers and they crawl back into their tortoise
[13:32.960 --> 13:40.080]  shells that would be terrible news said Alan Blender former Fed vice chairman
[13:40.080 --> 13:45.920]  and now an economist professor for Princeton University so there's that
[13:45.920 --> 13:54.440]  financial news Americans feel 15.6 unemployment as under employment surges
[13:54.440 --> 13:59.160]  and that's the Bloomberg headline I was talking about seeing 15 plus percent
[13:59.160 --> 14:06.280]  Joseph Ramelow gave up searching for a job in January to return to school two
[14:06.280 --> 14:12.520]  months after he was laid off as a San Francisco electrician clerk and Tony
[14:12.520 --> 14:17.840]  Oppo is struggling to get by by doing part-time landscaping in Greensboro
[14:17.840 --> 14:23.240]  North Carolina after losing his job as an electrician while such workers are
[14:23.240 --> 14:28.360]  feeling real pain from the recession that began in December of 07 they're not
[14:28.360 --> 14:33.400]  represented in the 8.5% unemployment rate that Labor Department reported last
[14:33.400 --> 14:38.640]  week they're part of a broader group that includes those who want a job but have
[14:38.640 --> 14:42.520]  stopped looking for work and those who want full-time positions but have to
[14:42.520 --> 14:49.280]  settle for part-time employment a measure of under employment that counts
[14:49.280 --> 14:57.160]  those people has almost doubled over the past two years to 15.6% providing a
[14:57.160 --> 15:03.080]  more complete gauge of the labor market deterioration and you had the 8.5%
[15:03.080 --> 15:09.720]  to that and you're talking 25 plus percent unemployment along with the
[15:09.720 --> 15:13.320]  historic drop in the percentage of the population who are working and record
[15:13.320 --> 15:17.800]  numbers of long-term unemployment the figures point to a permanent shift in
[15:17.800 --> 15:23.360]  employment patterns said former US Labor Secretary Robert Reich he's the guy
[15:23.360 --> 15:27.680]  that said we have to make sure none of the stimulus money goes to white men that's
[15:27.680 --> 15:32.120]  an actual quote what a socialist globalist minion brought up by the big
[15:32.120 --> 15:39.040]  central banks what a demonic twerp people are just unbelievable racist and
[15:39.040 --> 15:47.160]  self-haters but that's okay cuz see it's okay to say white people are evil and
[15:47.160 --> 15:50.840]  it's a good distraction they can play the lower classes made of a black white
[15:50.840 --> 15:55.120]  a span occasion doesn't matter off against rich whitey who's really the
[15:55.120 --> 15:59.080]  white guy that just happens to have a good job and then you know the working
[15:59.080 --> 16:02.800]  classes all think the elite is the person in the $300,000 house robbing
[16:02.800 --> 16:07.560]  the $50,000 car never discovering David Rockefeller the Rothschilds the new
[16:07.560 --> 16:15.640]  world order here's another Bloomberg headline Mayo says loan losses will
[16:15.640 --> 16:23.200]  exceed depression levels Mike Mayo who left Deutsche Bank AG last month and
[16:23.200 --> 16:32.600]  joined CLSA assigned an underweight rating to US banks and predicted loan
[16:32.600 --> 16:38.920]  losses will exceed levels from the Great Depression you hear that loan losses
[16:38.920 --> 16:43.480]  will exceed levels from the Great Depression and so they'll just take
[16:43.480 --> 16:48.880]  money from US taxpayers and just give it to the banks and say you're not allowed
[16:48.880 --> 16:54.640]  to lose money as offshore corporations that don't pay US taxes here are people
[16:54.640 --> 16:58.000]  who are all losing their jobs they will make sure you get billion dollar
[16:58.000 --> 17:03.320]  bonuses how does that sound US stocks dropped after Mayo gave shell ratings
[17:03.320 --> 17:08.760]  to banks including Winston Salem North Carolina base BB and T core Cincinnati
[17:08.760 --> 17:14.280]  fifth third largest bank core Bank of America core and JP Morgan Chase the
[17:14.280 --> 17:20.120]  two biggest US banks by assets were assigned underperform ratings Mayo said
[17:20.120 --> 17:26.280]  in a report today and he goes on to say that this will be the greatest bank
[17:26.280 --> 17:30.120]  losses since the Great Depression now well the banks are just front companies
[17:30.120 --> 17:33.560]  they've already moved the real assets out the back door to the new world order
[17:33.560 --> 17:39.680]  people to the private holdings in Europe here's another one Gettner may oust more
[17:39.680 --> 17:46.120]  executives at banks needing exceptional aid and other corporations so you know
[17:46.120 --> 17:50.480]  firing the head of GM just saying we're going to take over the whole economy
[17:50.480 --> 17:55.520]  we're going into IMF World Bank XM Bank International Bank of Settlements
[17:55.520 --> 18:04.160]  receivership some of the other news riot cops killed newspaper seller at G20 you
[18:04.160 --> 18:07.640]  notice you heard that oh a guy had a heart attack and fell down and died well
[18:07.640 --> 18:12.640]  now photographers and media are reporting that they saw him being beaten by
[18:12.640 --> 18:18.320]  police with billy clubs in a pool of blood and then he then died of a heart
[18:18.320 --> 18:27.880]  attack so nobody's gonna mourn for him the cops go into these frenzies just
[18:27.880 --> 18:31.880]  like the girl at the Red Sox championship a few years ago she walks out
[18:31.880 --> 18:35.680]  of a bar they shoot her from five feet away with a rubber bullet blowing her
[18:35.680 --> 18:41.240]  eye back into her head she bleeds the death right there on the cement and the
[18:41.240 --> 18:45.720]  cops just said just doing our job yeah shooting somebody at five feet away with
[18:45.720 --> 18:50.960]  a rubber bullet in the face just the wrong person at the wrong place at the
[18:50.960 --> 18:58.680]  wrong time meanwhile newspapers are in the process of collapsing or are
[18:58.680 --> 19:06.120]  collapsing all over the United States Times Co threatens to shut down globe
[19:06.120 --> 19:10.240]  the Boston Globe owned by the New York Times they're threatening to shut them
[19:10.240 --> 19:14.960]  down unless workers give 20 million dollars in concessions union leaders
[19:14.960 --> 19:19.040]  say so well just keep spewing propaganda and lies and nobody's gonna want a
[19:19.040 --> 19:24.640]  region you'll collapse that much faster Boston Globe and that leads me to the
[19:24.640 --> 19:30.520]  next issue you know folks love watching a train wreck that's why for the Sunday

[24:46.880 --> 24:56.880]  ever has been so many tensions can be both hands can be full of breeze
[25:04.240 --> 25:09.320]  okay so remember back when the feds bombed the Oklahoma City Building in
[25:09.320 --> 25:14.960]  1995 to demonize the states rights movement which states declaring
[25:14.960 --> 25:19.000]  sovereignty under the 10th Amendment saying they were gonna take control back
[25:19.000 --> 25:22.120]  over the federal government they created as the 10th and 9th Amendment clearly
[25:22.120 --> 25:26.240]  state is our right in our duty and Oklahoma was leading the charge so the
[25:26.240 --> 25:30.760]  feds on record blew that building to bits with bombs inside and outside the
[25:30.760 --> 25:37.440]  building and then it came out in federal FBI documents through lawsuits that the
[25:37.440 --> 25:42.960]  Associated Press and the two major papers in Salt Lake City covered with the
[25:42.960 --> 25:47.360]  trying to do case at the Southern Poverty Law Center was running the
[25:47.360 --> 25:50.920]  Elohim City white supremacist compound where the bombing was supposedly
[25:50.920 --> 25:56.760]  hatched not not infiltrating running the stinking thing and then in sworn
[25:56.760 --> 26:01.280]  affidavits out of the federal prisons with Terry Nichols that McVeigh was a
[26:01.280 --> 26:06.760]  special forces operator sent in to quote set up militias with the bombing
[26:06.760 --> 26:12.520]  but you saw how they treated their patsy but they did with him so a very
[26:12.520 --> 26:18.640]  nasty group of people to say the least and they claim that Russia limbaugh
[26:18.640 --> 26:22.880]  remember we've got a shutdown talk radio we've got a control-free speech we've
[26:22.880 --> 26:27.600]  got to do it now meanwhile Obama has introduced a bill that even Mother
[26:27.600 --> 26:31.720]  Jones magazine very liberal but they admit will basically take over the
[26:31.720 --> 26:35.760]  Internet and begin shutting it down this on the heels of Senator Jay Rockefeller
[26:35.760 --> 26:39.960]  saying two weeks ago we'd be better off if we never had the Internet we've got
[26:39.960 --> 26:44.520]  to get rid of it basically as the New York Times said quote have gatekeepers
[26:44.520 --> 26:48.440]  and Internet to and a kindler gentler Internet for your safety with less
[26:48.440 --> 26:55.800]  freedom so that's what this is all about that's what this attack on myself and
[26:55.800 --> 27:00.920]  others Glenn Beck has been attacked because of this mass shooter only shot
[27:00.920 --> 27:08.480]  three cops shot five total killed three yes Glenn Beck media matters and raw
[27:08.480 --> 27:13.680]  story and a bunch of others are saying it's Glenn Beck's fault this shooter in
[27:13.680 --> 27:20.040]  Pittsburgh Pennsylvania did this because Glenn Beck has been lying saying
[27:20.040 --> 27:30.040]  Barack Obama wants to confiscate guns Barack Obama is on record as a state
[27:30.040 --> 27:36.480]  senator and in the US Senate voting for a total assault weapons ban anything
[27:36.480 --> 27:43.240]  semi-automatic he lobbied and argued for a complete gun ban when he was a state
[27:43.240 --> 27:48.600]  senator Illinois his attorney general last year filed on behalf of the Justice
[27:48.600 --> 27:55.320]  Department when he was just a former deputy attorney general of the briefing
[27:55.320 --> 28:00.600]  you can read on the government's behalf at the Supreme Court on the DC gun
[28:00.600 --> 28:06.800]  ban saying no citizen should be allowed to even own a single shot shotgun or
[28:06.800 --> 28:12.200]  handgun no firearms period only police and military you can go read that right
[28:12.200 --> 28:16.920]  now it's in the Supreme Court briefing it's on the Supreme Court website
[28:16.920 --> 28:22.440]  Eric Holder is on record so all Glenn Beck does and you know we're normally
[28:22.440 --> 28:27.320]  not defending Lynn Beck here all Glenn Beck does is say yes they're moving to
[28:27.320 --> 28:32.320]  confiscate firearms this is what they want to do and then somebody gets scared
[28:32.320 --> 28:36.680]  of that somebody gets upset about that who's lost their job who was unstable
[28:36.680 --> 28:41.960]  clearly who was in the Marines boy that's always a thread in this trained to
[28:41.960 --> 28:46.080]  kill trained to get rid of his inhibitions and have instinctive shooting
[28:46.080 --> 28:54.220]  instinctive killing if you do not kill you will be dead marine and I'm not
[28:54.220 --> 28:58.000]  blaming the Marines for this the point is it's an ingredient and then he gets in
[28:58.000 --> 29:01.360]  a fight with mommy because his dog is urinating all over the floor he's 22
[29:01.360 --> 29:06.000]  years old out of work the cops come he throws a fit and guns to him down the
[29:06.000 --> 29:10.040]  doorway of his house another one comes he kills him runs upstairs gets shot up
[29:10.040 --> 29:17.280]  by other police that arrives shoots couple of them the police back off and
[29:17.280 --> 29:22.480]  they try to tie it into Glenn Beck but they didn't stop there oh no they had to
[29:22.480 --> 29:30.600]  bring Alex Jones into it evil Alex Jones because this guy's friends say that he

[34:19.800 --> 34:21.800]  Thank you so much for joining us
[34:21.800 --> 34:23.800]  You have found the tip of the spear
[34:23.800 --> 34:26.800]  The front lines in the Info War
[34:29.800 --> 34:33.800]  Okay, so two people have been chosen
[34:33.800 --> 34:35.800]  Out of this tragedy to be demonized
[34:35.800 --> 34:39.800]  Two people mainly, myself and Glenn Beck
[34:39.800 --> 34:42.800]  By media matters, run by Mr. Brock
[34:42.800 --> 34:46.800]  A former neocon, by Raw Story
[34:46.800 --> 34:50.800]  And by, of course, the Pittsburgh Post Gazette
[34:50.800 --> 34:52.800]  Now, do they talk about how we have these
[34:52.800 --> 34:55.800]  Tens of millions of immigrants that keep committing crimes
[34:55.800 --> 34:58.800]  Like the individual that killed 14 people
[34:58.800 --> 35:00.800]  Including himself in upstate New York
[35:00.800 --> 35:03.800]  Throwing a fit because he was jobless
[35:03.800 --> 35:06.800]  Do they discuss why do we have a phenomenon now
[35:06.800 --> 35:09.800]  Of people committing suicide when they lose their jobs
[35:09.800 --> 35:13.800]  But not just committing suicide, taking others with them
[35:13.800 --> 35:16.800]  Is there a discussion about how violent video games
[35:16.800 --> 35:19.800]  Every study shows destroy the inhibition
[35:19.800 --> 35:21.800]  Against committing murder?
[35:21.800 --> 35:23.800]  No, there's no discussion about that
[35:23.800 --> 35:26.800]  No, instead, out of the mass shootings
[35:26.800 --> 35:30.800]  There have been five since last Friday
[35:30.800 --> 35:33.800]  All over the nation, fathers lose their jobs
[35:33.800 --> 35:35.800]  So they go home to the house
[35:35.800 --> 35:38.800]  And they blow their wife and children's heads off
[35:38.800 --> 35:40.800]  Or they stab them to death
[35:40.800 --> 35:42.800]  Or they burn them to death
[35:42.800 --> 35:44.800]  I mean, what is going on here?
[35:44.800 --> 35:47.800]  The breakdown of society
[35:47.800 --> 35:50.800]  I mean, I could have, you know, no money
[35:50.800 --> 35:52.800]  I could have my legs chopped off
[35:52.800 --> 35:54.800]  I could be totally depressed
[35:54.800 --> 35:57.800]  I could enter my mind to kill my family
[35:57.800 --> 36:05.800]  But that's what happens in this jealous, covetous, lazy, demonic society
[36:05.800 --> 36:07.800]  You know, the establishment doesn't care about
[36:07.800 --> 36:10.800]  Killing 50 million babies with abortion
[36:10.800 --> 36:13.800]  They don't care about killing 1,300,000 Iraqis
[36:13.800 --> 36:15.800]  That's, oh, that's those brown people
[36:15.800 --> 36:16.800]  Let them die
[36:16.800 --> 36:19.800]  Well, what do you expect is going to happen here at home?
[36:19.800 --> 36:21.800]  Now, a lot of this is overblown
[36:21.800 --> 36:25.800]  Plus million, 300 plus million people in this country
[36:25.800 --> 36:28.800]  And statistically, less police are killed today
[36:28.800 --> 36:30.800]  Than were killed just a few decades ago
[36:30.800 --> 36:32.800]  Statistically, there are less shootings
[36:32.800 --> 36:35.800]  According to the Justice Department in 2008
[36:35.800 --> 36:37.800]  Than there were in the year 2000
[36:37.800 --> 36:42.800]  Crime again dropping precipitously in what, 1991
[36:42.800 --> 36:45.800]  From its height in 1987
[36:45.800 --> 36:48.800]  During the peak of the crack cocaine epidemic
[36:48.800 --> 36:52.800]  But whereas you have less liquor store robberies and deaths
[36:52.800 --> 36:55.800]  And less bank robbery shootouts
[36:55.800 --> 36:57.800]  And less gang shootouts
[36:57.800 --> 36:59.800]  Because they've basically killed themselves
[36:59.800 --> 37:00.800]  Killed each other off
[37:00.800 --> 37:03.800]  There is statistically more
[37:03.800 --> 37:04.800]  They just make up a smaller part
[37:04.800 --> 37:06.800]  So the overall number is down
[37:06.800 --> 37:08.800]  Of just completely crazy people
[37:08.800 --> 37:11.800]  Running around, killing, stabbing, burning, shooting
[37:11.800 --> 37:13.800]  Their fellow man
[37:13.800 --> 37:16.800]  And a lot of that is the mainstream media
[37:16.800 --> 37:17.800]  Advertising these shootings
[37:17.800 --> 37:19.800]  And promoting them and hyping them
[37:19.800 --> 37:21.800]  And then copycats hear this and go
[37:21.800 --> 37:22.800]  Well, I lost my job
[37:22.800 --> 37:25.800]  I'm depressed, I'm feeling nasty
[37:25.800 --> 37:27.800]  I'm having a dirty day
[37:27.800 --> 37:28.800]  You know, that's what I call it
[37:28.800 --> 37:30.800]  When you feel all grungy and angry
[37:30.800 --> 37:32.800]  And not just depressed
[37:32.800 --> 37:34.800]  But just grungy
[37:34.800 --> 37:37.800]  That happens to me only once every two or three years
[37:37.800 --> 37:40.800]  I'm told a lot of people feel like that every day
[37:40.800 --> 37:42.800]  Of course, when I do feel like that
[37:42.800 --> 37:45.800]  I go out and go for a 10-mile hike
[37:45.800 --> 37:49.800]  Here's it every time
[37:49.800 --> 37:52.800]  Or go out and join the Golden Gloves
[37:52.800 --> 37:55.800]  Or something, go to a local boxing club
[37:55.800 --> 37:57.800]  And get your head beat in
[37:57.800 --> 37:58.800]  And see how you like it
[37:58.800 --> 38:00.800]  That'll get rid of your depression real fast
[38:00.800 --> 38:02.800]  But I'm already digressing
[38:02.800 --> 38:07.800]  The issue here is that
[38:07.800 --> 38:11.800]  Well, this goes into so many areas
[38:11.800 --> 38:13.800]  Not just why this guy did what he did
[38:13.800 --> 38:15.800]  Or where society's going
[38:15.800 --> 38:17.800]  But how the mainstream media
[38:17.800 --> 38:19.800]  And the controlled corporate media
[38:19.800 --> 38:23.800]  Is trying to tie it to talk radio and free speech
[38:23.800 --> 38:26.800]  To go after free speech with this new McCarthyism
[38:26.800 --> 38:29.800]  In the United States
[38:29.800 --> 38:32.800]  You see, it's my fault
[38:32.800 --> 38:34.800]  That this guy killed three cops
[38:34.800 --> 38:36.800]  According to several newspapers
[38:36.800 --> 38:40.800]  Because I talk about how Obama
[38:40.800 --> 38:42.800]  Is anti-second amendment
[38:42.800 --> 38:46.800]  Well, by that flawed logic
[38:46.800 --> 38:49.800]  It's Barack Obama's fault
[38:49.800 --> 38:51.800]  That when he was a state senator
[38:51.800 --> 38:53.800]  He called for total gun bans in Illinois
[38:53.800 --> 38:55.800]  All guns to be banned
[38:55.800 --> 38:56.800]  That's on record
[38:56.800 --> 38:57.800]  Or that when he was a U.S. senator
[38:57.800 --> 38:59.800]  He voted for some of the most draconian laws
[38:59.800 --> 39:02.800]  Ever against the second amendment at the federal level
[39:02.800 --> 39:04.800]  Or that his chief of staff is for an open
[39:04.800 --> 39:06.800]  Total gun ban of the American people
[39:06.800 --> 39:08.800]  Or that Eric Holder on record
[39:08.800 --> 39:10.800]  Before the Supreme Court
[39:10.800 --> 39:12.800]  So pull it up, we've read it on air
[39:12.800 --> 39:14.800]  Filed a briefing saying
[39:14.800 --> 39:16.800]  We are for the total abolition of quote
[39:16.800 --> 39:18.800]  Civilian ownership of firearms
[39:18.800 --> 39:21.800]  Only the police and military should own
[39:21.800 --> 39:24.800]  But see, the Pittsburgh Post Gazette
[39:24.800 --> 39:26.800]  Calls that a conspiracy theory
[39:26.800 --> 39:29.800]  Raw story calls that a conspiracy theory
[39:32.800 --> 39:34.800]  Media matters
[39:34.800 --> 39:36.800]  Calls that a conspiracy theory
[39:36.800 --> 39:39.800]  And calls me a nut
[39:39.800 --> 39:41.800]  Because
[39:44.800 --> 39:47.800]  I happen to know how to read
[39:47.800 --> 39:50.800]  Government documents
[39:50.800 --> 39:53.800]  I happen to know how to go over to the
[39:53.800 --> 39:56.800]  Supreme Court website and read the briefings
[39:56.800 --> 40:00.800]  Both pro and con for the second amendment
[40:00.800 --> 40:02.800]  I happen to have Larry Pratt
[40:02.800 --> 40:04.800]  And many other second amendment group leaders on
[40:04.800 --> 40:07.800]  Aaron Zelman, he's the preservation of firearms ownership
[40:07.800 --> 40:11.800]  On to read their filings on air
[40:13.800 --> 40:15.800]  And so because I am informed that I don't
[40:15.800 --> 40:18.800]  Just go to the Pittsburgh Post Gazette
[40:18.800 --> 40:21.800]  And other newspapers for my news and information
[40:21.800 --> 40:24.800]  I am bad
[40:24.800 --> 40:27.800]  I'm also being attacked by little green footballs
[40:27.800 --> 40:29.800]  Also run by a quote former liberal
[40:29.800 --> 40:32.800]  Now a neocon
[40:32.800 --> 40:35.800]  So we'll go over some of that
[40:35.800 --> 40:37.800]  But again, I'm not covering this
[40:37.800 --> 40:39.800]  Because it's about Alex Jones
[40:39.800 --> 40:41.800]  This is an attack on everyone who believes in
[40:41.800 --> 40:43.800]  The second amendment and who holds it dear
[40:43.800 --> 40:45.800]  As the bedrock of freedom and liberty
[40:45.800 --> 40:47.800]  This is also an attack on the first amendment
[40:47.800 --> 40:49.800]  Free speech because they're calling to shut down
[40:49.800 --> 40:51.800]  Freedom on the internet, freedom on talk radio
[40:51.800 --> 40:53.800]  The bills have been introduced
[40:53.800 --> 40:55.800]  The chairman of the committee that's over it
[40:55.800 --> 40:57.800]  J. Rockefeller says he wants it
[40:57.800 --> 40:59.800]  The New York Times, everybody's pushing for it
[40:59.800 --> 41:02.800]  And so the fight is on
[41:02.800 --> 41:04.800]  And they'll use people like me
[41:04.800 --> 41:06.800]  Who they see as extreme
[41:06.800 --> 41:09.800]  Who they think will scare middle America
[41:09.800 --> 41:12.800]  Into going along with this
[41:12.800 --> 41:15.800]  Or at least go along with it enough
[41:15.800 --> 41:18.800]  To stand down and not speak up and say no
[41:18.800 --> 41:21.800]  To having free speech butchered
[41:21.800 --> 41:24.800]  Also, raw story attacks me
[41:24.800 --> 41:28.800]  And says that I'm this delusional off-the-wall person
[41:28.800 --> 41:31.800]  Who claimed that they were going to put troops
[41:31.800 --> 41:33.800]  On the streets of America
[41:33.800 --> 41:36.800]  And so that scared the 22-year-old
[41:36.800 --> 41:40.800]  Unemployed Richard Popoloski
[41:40.800 --> 41:42.800]  And so because I lied about that
[41:42.800 --> 41:44.800]  And because I lied about it
[41:44.800 --> 41:46.800]  And because I lied about it
[41:46.800 --> 41:48.800]  And because I lied about it
[41:48.800 --> 41:50.800]  And because I lied about it
[41:50.800 --> 41:52.800]  And because I made that up
[41:52.800 --> 41:55.800]  Because I talked because I had free speech
[41:55.800 --> 41:57.800]  That that made him
[41:57.800 --> 41:59.800]  When his mommy called the police on him
[41:59.800 --> 42:01.800]  And he threw a fit and killed the cops
[42:01.800 --> 42:03.800]  That's what this was
[42:03.800 --> 42:05.800]  This was impulse control problem
[42:05.800 --> 42:07.800]  This was a rage problem
[42:07.800 --> 42:09.800]  This was a, police will tell you
[42:09.800 --> 42:11.800]  The most dangerous thing to go to
[42:11.800 --> 42:13.800]  Are these domestic disputes
[42:13.800 --> 42:16.800]  That's when cops get killed most often
[42:16.800 --> 42:18.800]  It's not bank robbery shootouts
[42:18.800 --> 42:20.800]  It's not side of the road shootouts
[42:20.800 --> 42:22.800]  It's domestic disputes
[42:22.800 --> 42:24.800]  The woman will call the police
[42:24.800 --> 42:26.800]  The police get there
[42:26.800 --> 42:28.800]  They start putting their drunken husband
[42:28.800 --> 42:29.800]  In handcuffs
[42:29.800 --> 42:30.800]  The woman will pull a gun out
[42:30.800 --> 42:31.800]  And shoot the cops
[42:31.800 --> 42:33.800]  Or run up and stab them with a knife
[42:33.800 --> 42:35.800]  Happens every day in this country
[42:35.800 --> 42:36.800]  You see it in the news
[42:36.800 --> 42:38.800]  So it's the domestic disputes
[42:38.800 --> 42:39.800]  The main thing
[42:39.800 --> 42:41.800]  And then yes, Obama's actions
[42:41.800 --> 42:43.800]  Calling for total gun bans
[42:43.800 --> 42:45.800]  And the mainstream news announcing
[42:45.800 --> 42:47.800]  CNN, you name it
[42:47.800 --> 42:49.800]  Calling troops on the streets
[42:49.800 --> 42:52.800]  That whacked this former Marine out
[42:52.800 --> 42:54.800]  Who was also hopeless over losing his job
[42:54.800 --> 42:56.800]  And having to move in with mommy
[42:56.800 --> 43:00.800]  And so what happened?
[43:00.800 --> 43:02.800]  The police came out thinking they were
[43:02.800 --> 43:04.800]  Responding to a normal dispute
[43:04.800 --> 43:06.800]  And got killed and it's a tragedy
[43:06.800 --> 43:08.800]  And this is slander, this is libel
[43:08.800 --> 43:10.800]  This is an attempt
[43:12.800 --> 43:15.800]  Through guilt by association
[43:15.800 --> 43:17.800]  To say, well, what's on somebody's
[43:17.800 --> 43:19.800]  Bookshelf? What were they reading?
[43:19.800 --> 43:21.800]  What were they doing?
[43:21.800 --> 43:23.800]  Oh my God, Alex Jones
[43:23.800 --> 43:25.800]  Listening to Alex Jones is like
[43:25.800 --> 43:27.800]  The new Turner Diaries
[43:27.800 --> 43:29.800]  Well, the Turner Diaries calls for
[43:29.800 --> 43:31.800]  Killing Police
[43:31.800 --> 43:33.800]  And it talks about what the Second Revolution
[43:33.800 --> 43:35.800]  Is going to look like from a white supremacist view
[43:35.800 --> 43:37.800]  We are completely aligned
[43:37.800 --> 43:39.800]  Against that on record
[43:39.800 --> 43:41.800]  And are calling for nonviolent
[43:41.800 --> 43:43.800]  Protest against this tyranny
[43:43.800 --> 43:45.800]  They don't care, they want to make
[43:45.800 --> 43:47.800]  Listening to Alex Jones to be
[43:47.800 --> 43:49.800]  The new Turner Diaries
[43:49.800 --> 43:51.800]  Oh my gosh, you listen to Alex Jones
[43:51.800 --> 43:53.800]  Now, this may help the establishment
[43:53.800 --> 43:55.800]  A little bit, but this is kind of an old trick
[43:55.800 --> 43:57.800]  From the 80s and 90s
[43:57.800 --> 43:59.800]  And it's really failing
[43:59.800 --> 44:01.800]  But overall, it's only helping
[44:01.800 --> 44:03.800]  This radio show
[44:03.800 --> 44:05.800]  Man, this is that radical hard-core
[44:05.800 --> 44:07.800]  Radio show that
[44:07.800 --> 44:09.800]  You know, is so influential
[44:09.800 --> 44:11.800]  And so dark
[44:11.800 --> 44:13.800]  And cutting edge and shocking
[44:13.800 --> 44:15.800]  That it leaves a wake of dead cops
[44:15.800 --> 44:17.800]  In its
[44:19.800 --> 44:21.800]  In its thrall
[44:21.800 --> 44:23.800]  And so
[44:23.800 --> 44:25.800]  We look at just the internet numbers alone
[44:25.800 --> 44:27.800]  Record listenership today
[44:27.800 --> 44:29.800]  It's disgusting
[44:29.800 --> 44:31.800]  And
[44:33.800 --> 44:35.800]  Kurt Nemo wrote a story Saturday
[44:35.800 --> 44:37.800]  Night
[44:37.800 --> 44:39.800]  Defending me, and it went up for a few minutes
[44:39.800 --> 44:41.800]  And I called him and I said, take it down
[44:41.800 --> 44:43.800]  I said, right now
[44:43.800 --> 44:45.800]  This story is only
[44:45.800 --> 44:47.800]  In one newspaper
[44:47.800 --> 44:49.800]  Tying the killings to me
[44:49.800 --> 44:51.800]  I said, I don't want publicity off of this
[44:51.800 --> 44:53.800]  And Kurt's like, oh, absolutely, no
[44:53.800 --> 44:55.800]  I'm just defending you, and I said, I know it's the right thing to do
[44:55.800 --> 44:57.800]  But wait and see
[44:57.800 --> 44:59.800]  If this gets picked up all over the place
[44:59.800 --> 45:01.800]  Because I don't want the publicity
[45:01.800 --> 45:03.800]  Off this from dead cops
[45:03.800 --> 45:05.800]  And then
[45:05.800 --> 45:07.800]  I called him Sunday evening and I said, go ahead
[45:07.800 --> 45:09.800]  It's all over the place
[45:09.800 --> 45:11.800]  The media is getting publicity
[45:11.800 --> 45:13.800]  Against the Second Amendment
[45:13.800 --> 45:15.800]  Against free speech off the hides
[45:15.800 --> 45:17.800]  Of these three dead police officers
[45:17.800 --> 45:19.800]  These three dead heroes
[45:19.800 --> 45:21.800]  Who laid down their life
[45:21.800 --> 45:23.800]  Their lives
[45:23.800 --> 45:25.800]  For this spoiled, rotten
[45:25.800 --> 45:27.800]  Sack of crap
[45:29.800 --> 45:31.800]  Who was so spoiled
[45:31.800 --> 45:33.800]  That when mommy told him get out of the house
[45:33.800 --> 45:35.800]  He didn't say yes, mom
[45:35.800 --> 45:37.800]  And pack his crap up
[45:37.800 --> 45:39.800]  And leave
[45:39.800 --> 45:41.800]  And so when the cops came
[45:41.800 --> 45:43.800]  Instead of getting in his car with the guns
[45:43.800 --> 45:45.800]  Or leaving the guns for the cops
[45:45.800 --> 45:47.800]  He sat there and killed him
[45:47.800 --> 45:49.800]  This is not the police going door to door
[45:49.800 --> 45:51.800]  Down the street at checkpoints
[45:51.800 --> 45:53.800]  Confiscating everybody's guns
[45:53.800 --> 45:55.800]  If that happens, it's 1776
[45:55.800 --> 45:57.800]  And it starts, folks
[45:57.800 --> 45:59.800]  And then we're in the right defending ourselves
[45:59.800 --> 46:01.800]  But no, your dog
[46:01.800 --> 46:03.800]  Is pissing on the rug
[46:05.800 --> 46:07.800]  You live with mommy at 22 years old
[46:07.800 --> 46:09.800]  You've lost your job
[46:09.800 --> 46:11.800]  It's her house, if you're going to live there
[46:11.800 --> 46:13.800]  You live there under her rules, no
[46:15.800 --> 46:17.800]  No, she tells you to get rid of the dog
[46:17.800 --> 46:19.800]  This is what now the Associated Press reports happen
[46:19.800 --> 46:21.800]  You say no to it
[46:23.800 --> 46:25.800]  And then you throw a fit
[46:25.800 --> 46:27.800]  Waiting to kill cops when they come
[46:27.800 --> 46:29.800]  You're going to show mommy
[46:29.800 --> 46:31.800]  You're going to show her who's boss
[46:31.800 --> 46:33.800]  And we've all been teenagers before
[46:33.800 --> 46:35.800]  I can't believe this guy's 20-something years old
[46:35.800 --> 46:37.800]  And thrown a fit once or twice
[46:37.800 --> 46:39.800]  Or dumped a refrigerator over
[46:39.800 --> 46:41.800]  Or kicked a hole in the wall
[46:41.800 --> 46:43.800]  And the biggest thing I can tell young people
[46:43.800 --> 46:45.800]  In this situation is
[46:45.800 --> 46:47.800]  You're going to be a lot happier when you move out of your parents' house
[46:47.800 --> 46:49.800]  I don't care if you've got to live in a shack
[46:49.800 --> 46:51.800]  That's normal and natural
[46:51.800 --> 46:53.800]  Get out of your parents' house
[46:53.800 --> 46:55.800]  Now, if your parents are disabled or something
[46:55.800 --> 46:57.800]  And need your help, that's another thing
[46:57.800 --> 46:59.800]  Build a house next to them and raise your kids
[46:59.800 --> 47:01.800]  That's good. Move out for a few years though and come back
[47:01.800 --> 47:03.800]  The whole issue is this not having a job
[47:03.800 --> 47:05.800]  Sitting in mommy's house
[47:05.800 --> 47:07.800]  It's a recipe for disaster
[47:07.800 --> 47:09.800]  And for any young people out there listening
[47:09.800 --> 47:11.800]  Your parents get in your face, just leave
[47:11.800 --> 47:13.800]  Your wife gets in your face
[47:13.800 --> 47:15.800]  You start having a fight, leave
[47:15.800 --> 47:17.800]  It's best to de-escalate things
[47:19.800 --> 47:21.800]  You know, I had girlfriends, many of them
[47:21.800 --> 47:23.800]  Who go wild, start punching me or whatever
[47:23.800 --> 47:25.800]  I learned to just leave, folks
[47:25.800 --> 47:27.800]  Because this is how
[47:27.800 --> 47:29.800]  America's spoiled rotten now
[47:29.800 --> 47:31.800]  And this is what goes on
[47:31.800 --> 47:33.800]  Because your girlfriend starts slapping you
[47:33.800 --> 47:35.800]  Or scratching you and you punch her in the face
[47:35.800 --> 47:37.800]  Or throw her on the ground
[47:37.800 --> 47:39.800]  She's going to call the cops on you and your life's over
[47:41.800 --> 47:43.800]  Just leave
[47:43.800 --> 47:45.800]  That's how you win these arguments
[47:45.800 --> 47:47.800]  But no
[47:47.800 --> 47:49.800]  She calls the cops, he gets all fired up
[47:49.800 --> 47:51.800]  Oh my god, they're coming for his guns
[47:51.800 --> 47:53.800]  He lies in wait, he kills him
[47:53.800 --> 47:55.800]  It's a domestic dispute
[47:57.800 --> 47:59.800]  About 70% of this happened
[47:59.800 --> 48:01.800]  Because this young man had no impulse control
[48:01.800 --> 48:03.800]  And because
[48:03.800 --> 48:05.800]  He'd been in the Marines and been trained
[48:05.800 --> 48:07.800]  To not have an inhibition against killing
[48:07.800 --> 48:09.800]  They train you to have the killer instinct
[48:09.800 --> 48:11.800]  And to hone that and sharpen it
[48:11.800 --> 48:13.800]  That's 70% of this, the other 30% or so
[48:13.800 --> 48:15.800]  Is the fact that
[48:15.800 --> 48:17.800]  He lost his job
[48:17.800 --> 48:19.800]  Just like the other four
[48:19.800 --> 48:21.800]  Mass shootings we've had in the last
[48:21.800 --> 48:23.800]  Three days
[48:23.800 --> 48:25.800]  Four days
[48:25.800 --> 48:27.800]  Have been people losing their jobs
[48:27.800 --> 48:29.800]  They get this feeling of hopelessness
[48:29.800 --> 48:31.800]  They get this feeling of worklessness
[48:31.800 --> 48:33.800]  They think their life's over
[48:33.800 --> 48:35.800]  Their wife's screaming at them
[48:35.800 --> 48:37.800]  And it always happens the same
[48:37.800 --> 48:39.800]  They put a bullet in their wife
[48:39.800 --> 48:41.800]  Then they're freaking out and throw a fit
[48:41.800 --> 48:43.800]  And then they gun their kids down
[48:43.800 --> 48:45.800]  Let me tell you something
[48:45.800 --> 48:47.800]  Before you ever kill your wife or kids
[48:47.800 --> 48:49.800]  Go out in the backyard
[48:49.800 --> 48:51.800]  And blow your own stinkin' head off
[48:51.800 --> 48:53.800]  It's bad enough to kill yourself
[48:53.800 --> 48:55.800]  But you should never even let it enter your
[48:55.800 --> 48:57.800]  Mind
[48:57.800 --> 48:59.800]  To kill your wife and family
[48:59.800 --> 49:01.800]  So your wife's divorced you
[49:01.800 --> 49:03.800]  So she's taking the kids, she's living with some young guy
[49:03.800 --> 49:05.800]  On your paycheck
[49:05.800 --> 49:07.800]  That's just the way it is
[49:07.800 --> 49:09.800]  Still love your children
[49:09.800 --> 49:11.800]  Just forgive your ex-wife
[49:11.800 --> 49:13.800]  Don't go to the house dressed up like Santa Claus
[49:13.800 --> 49:17.800]  And kill everybody
[49:17.800 --> 49:19.800]  But what the media
[49:19.800 --> 49:21.800]  And the police are doing is
[49:21.800 --> 49:23.800]  They're combing over all these dozens
[49:23.800 --> 49:25.800]  Of mass shootings
[49:25.800 --> 49:27.800]  And they're looking for people
[49:27.800 --> 49:29.800]  Who have Ron Paul material
[49:29.800 --> 49:31.800]  Or Alex Jones material
[49:31.800 --> 49:33.800]  So they can try to bolster
[49:33.800 --> 49:35.800]  Their whole Mayak view of the world
[49:35.800 --> 49:37.800]  Which by the way is going to get a lot of cops killed
[49:37.800 --> 49:39.800]  If the police implement
[49:39.800 --> 49:41.800]  This Mayak view
[49:41.800 --> 49:43.800]  Because every day people pulled over
[49:43.800 --> 49:45.800]  For Ron Paul stickers, the cops are pulling guns out on them
[49:45.800 --> 49:47.800]  That then makes the public
[49:47.800 --> 49:49.800]  Scared of the cops and paranoid
[49:49.800 --> 49:51.800]  And then they're going to react
[49:51.800 --> 49:53.800]  Like this guy did to the police and military
[49:55.800 --> 49:57.800]  And that's the most important thing
[49:57.800 --> 49:59.800]  I can say about all of this
[49:59.800 --> 50:01.800]  Is that
[50:01.800 --> 50:03.800]  The police have been trained
[50:03.800 --> 50:05.800]  To be an us against them mentality
[50:05.800 --> 50:07.800]  And that they're all alone with the public
[50:07.800 --> 50:09.800]  Against them
[50:09.800 --> 50:11.800]  And the federal government
[50:11.800 --> 50:13.800]  And the ADL
[50:13.800 --> 50:15.800]  And all these groups
[50:15.800 --> 50:17.800]  Spend all their time
[50:17.800 --> 50:19.800]  Trying to separate the military
[50:19.800 --> 50:21.800]  And the police from the people
[50:21.800 --> 50:23.800]  When our interests are the same
[50:23.800 --> 50:25.800]  We're the American people
[50:25.800 --> 50:27.800]  And we have these offshore criminal banks
[50:27.800 --> 50:29.800]  Who openly finance the ADL
[50:29.800 --> 50:31.800]  To demonize the patriot movement
[50:31.800 --> 50:33.800]  To then make the patriot movement
[50:33.800 --> 50:35.800]  An enemy of the police and military
[50:35.800 --> 50:37.800]  And yes, the patriot movement
[50:37.800 --> 50:39.800]  Is buying that view
[50:39.800 --> 50:41.800]  And is buying that system
[50:41.800 --> 50:43.800]  And so are the police
[50:43.800 --> 50:45.800]  And so they've got a squaring off against each other
[50:45.800 --> 50:47.800]  In battle lines
[50:47.800 --> 50:49.800]  So we'll kill each other
[50:49.800 --> 50:51.800]  Instead of bringing the bankers to justice
[50:51.800 --> 50:53.800]  And that's the key to all this
[50:53.800 --> 50:55.800]  I'm going to keep covering it when we get back
[50:55.800 --> 50:57.800]  And then coming up the big concentration camp
[50:57.800 --> 50:59.800]  Expo says stay with us
[50:59.800 --> 51:01.800]  This year
[51:01.800 --> 51:03.800]  Many of us will have to make the tough decision
[51:03.800 --> 51:05.800]  On what to cut back on
[51:05.800 --> 51:07.800]  That's essential as we prepare for
[51:07.800 --> 51:09.800]  An uncertain future
[51:09.800 --> 51:11.800]  In these troubled times
[51:11.800 --> 51:13.800]  One of the most important things your family can have
[51:13.800 --> 51:15.800]  Is good health
[51:15.800 --> 51:17.800]  Some of the contributors to poor health
[51:17.800 --> 51:19.800]  Are parasites, viruses, toxins, and heavy metals
[51:19.800 --> 51:21.800]  It's a documented fact
[51:21.800 --> 51:23.800]  80% of all Americans
[51:23.800 --> 51:25.800]  And 85% of people around the world
[51:25.800 --> 51:27.800]  Suffer from internal parasites
[51:27.800 --> 51:29.800]  And parasitic infection
[51:29.800 --> 51:31.800]  Now you can fight internal parasites
[51:31.800 --> 51:33.800]  Heavy metals and high cholesterol
[51:33.800 --> 51:35.800]  And fossilized phytoplankton powder
[51:35.800 --> 51:37.800]  Also known as FPP
[51:37.800 --> 51:39.800]  With your favorite beverage once a day
[51:39.800 --> 51:41.800]  FPP is now available to you

[51:45.800 --> 51:47.800]  FPP is so affordable

[51:57.800 --> 51:59.800]  In the New World Order's
[51:59.800 --> 52:01.800]  War Against Humanity
[52:01.800 --> 52:03.800]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear
[52:03.800 --> 52:05.800]  We've got to have a
[52:05.800 --> 52:07.800]  Civilian National Security Force
[52:07.800 --> 52:09.800]  That's just as powerful
[52:09.800 --> 52:11.800]  Just as strong
[52:11.800 --> 52:13.800]  Just as well funded
[52:13.800 --> 52:15.800]  The Obama deception
[52:15.800 --> 52:17.800]  Completely destroys the myth
[52:17.800 --> 52:19.800]  That Obama is working for the best interest
[52:19.800 --> 52:21.800]  Of the American people
[52:21.800 --> 52:23.800]  Well Obama's already fudging
[52:23.800 --> 52:25.800]  Fudged since day one in this election
[52:25.800 --> 52:27.800]  If you have a demagogue
[52:27.800 --> 52:29.800]  With a fanatical mass movement
[52:29.800 --> 52:31.800]  A personality cultist
[52:31.800 --> 52:33.800]  Who is imposing the program
[52:33.800 --> 52:35.800]  Of a group of extreme bankers
[52:35.800 --> 52:37.800]  And finance oligarchs
[52:37.800 --> 52:39.800]  That's fascism
[52:39.800 --> 52:41.800]  It's not about left or right
[52:41.800 --> 52:43.800]  It's about a one world government
[52:43.800 --> 52:45.800]  This film documents
[52:45.800 --> 52:47.800]  Who Obama works for
[52:47.800 --> 52:49.800]  The lies he is told

[54:25.800 --> 54:27.800]  In the computer
[54:27.800 --> 54:29.800]  When we start simulcasting
[54:29.800 --> 54:31.800]  At prismplanet.tv
[54:31.800 --> 54:33.800]  Radio listeners will obviously
[54:33.800 --> 54:35.800]  Hear the audio
[54:37.800 --> 54:39.800]  When I go over the concentration camps
[54:41.800 --> 54:43.800]  In their history
[54:43.800 --> 54:45.800]  And what's really been set up in the United States
[54:45.800 --> 54:47.800]  They've also got over
[54:47.800 --> 54:49.800]  100 news articles that they're getting
[54:49.800 --> 54:51.800]  In order so that as I go over them
[54:51.800 --> 54:53.800]  On air they can pull them up on screen
[54:53.800 --> 55:00.120]  screen because I can show the armies on website where they admit Americans are on 24 camps
[55:00.120 --> 55:03.040]  working as slave labor and people won't believe it.
[55:03.040 --> 55:07.320]  So it's best to show the website, show it on screen and hope that folks will go check
[55:07.320 --> 55:11.340]  it out.
[55:11.340 --> 55:15.800]  So that's coming up in about 25 minutes.
[55:15.800 --> 55:16.800]  And why am I doing that?
[55:16.800 --> 55:20.280]  Glenn Beck said a month ago he was going to expose the FEMA camps and look like they
[55:20.280 --> 55:21.280]  were real.
[55:21.280 --> 55:25.520]  And I said he's doing that to get your confidence, he's an establishment hack, he's been reading
[55:25.520 --> 55:30.240]  federal talking points right out of the ADL saying arrest Ron Paul supporters, they're
[55:30.240 --> 55:31.240]  dangerous.
[55:31.240 --> 55:34.840]  Then he flip-flopped to get our confidence and I said that's what it was, watch, he's
[55:34.840 --> 55:36.920]  going to come out and debunk the FEMA camps.
[55:36.920 --> 55:39.560]  Then he announced a week and a half ago he's going to do it tonight.
[55:39.560 --> 55:43.600]  Now he may cancel that again, he's been endlessly hyping this.
[55:43.600 --> 55:46.000]  But regardless, we're going to expose him.
[55:46.000 --> 55:49.520]  Now understand, I'm going to show you about 10% of the evidence.
[55:49.520 --> 55:55.240]  With time constraints, I can only show you a few dozen media clips and news articles
[55:55.240 --> 56:00.520]  and go over them here in the time we have.
[56:00.520 --> 56:08.880]  And as usual, I'm about a mile deep and only a few hundred yards wide instead of a mile
[56:08.880 --> 56:10.880]  wide and inch deep.
[56:10.880 --> 56:16.280]  We have so much information and then such a limited time frame and area to put it all
[56:16.280 --> 56:21.160]  into but we're going to attempt to do that.
[56:21.160 --> 56:29.440]  But again, when I saw the Pittsburgh Post Gazette with the headline suspect in officer
[56:29.440 --> 56:35.200]  shooting was in the conspiracy theories and then it attacks me and attacks my websites
[56:35.200 --> 56:41.040]  and calls it conspiracy theories and things I discuss, I said, look, let's wait and see
[56:41.040 --> 56:42.040]  if this gets big.
[56:42.040 --> 56:47.480]  I said, this will get us a lot of hype, a lot of attention like P.T. Barnum said, you
[56:47.480 --> 56:50.080]  know, just spell my name right.
[56:50.080 --> 56:53.600]  But I don't want that type of attention on the backs of three dead cops and two injured
[56:53.600 --> 56:58.080]  police officers who were out there doing their job and got called to the scene by this young
[56:58.080 --> 57:03.600]  man's wife, a mother, excuse me.
[57:03.600 --> 57:07.880]  And it's just horrible, it's senseless.
[57:07.880 --> 57:09.920]  This was not them coming to confiscate his guns.
[57:09.920 --> 57:16.800]  This was his mother calling police to throw him out of the house.
[57:16.800 --> 57:20.080]  And some people are like, yeah, the American Revolution started, you know, let's start
[57:20.080 --> 57:22.840]  going out and capping police.
[57:22.840 --> 57:27.280]  That is exactly what the New World Order wants, ladies and gentlemen.
[57:27.280 --> 57:32.560]  They have spent decades brainwashing the police and military to train them to hate and distrust
[57:32.560 --> 57:40.320]  the American people and true libertarians and paleo conservatives in this country.
[57:40.320 --> 57:43.520]  And the establishment's getting scared right now because the police and military are waking
[57:43.520 --> 57:45.680]  up and joining us.
[57:45.680 --> 57:51.360]  And that's why the media revels in these dead cops and is using their deaths in a sickening
[57:51.360 --> 57:59.120]  fashion to try to get gas mileage against the First Amendment and the Second Amendment.
[57:59.120 --> 58:01.360]  And I keep warning the police and military.
[58:01.360 --> 58:06.960]  There are tens of millions of Americans who want to die, who are sick of life and sick
[58:06.960 --> 58:09.440]  of the government and sick of corruption.
[58:09.440 --> 58:17.720]  And they are just waiting with their firearms to go absolutely ape on anybody in a uniform.
[58:17.720 --> 58:21.720]  I keep trying to explain this to you that the New World Order has positioned you as
[58:21.720 --> 58:23.480]  the bad guy.
[58:23.480 --> 58:26.920]  The news shows the police brutality over and over again.
[58:26.920 --> 58:33.040]  This is a scyop and they've got two huge columns of the government and the police marching
[58:33.040 --> 58:34.280]  towards the people.
[58:34.280 --> 58:42.440]  And there's an evil plan behind this and I'm going to break it down when we get back.
[58:42.440 --> 58:50.760]  Thank you for listening to GCN, visit GCNLive.com today.
[58:50.760 --> 58:52.280]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[58:52.280 --> 58:56.160]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient and today that's more
[58:56.160 --> 58:57.160]  important than ever.
[58:57.160 --> 58:59.920]  We need to be independent and food and water is the key.
[58:59.920 --> 59:02.920]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line until you have your own bread.
[59:02.920 --> 59:06.840]  You'll never have to go to the super-dome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family
[59:06.840 --> 59:09.240]  in any emergency if you simply prepare.
[59:09.240 --> 59:12.480]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[59:12.480 --> 59:16.880]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to shift horrible food that's safe from E. coli,
[59:16.880 --> 59:21.160]  salmonella genetic alteration or Chinese imports and they do it at almost half the cost of
[59:21.160 --> 59:22.760]  last year's grocery prices.

[59:46.640 --> 59:53.520]  The first step is getting storable food.
[59:53.520 --> 1:00:05.440]  Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[1:00:05.440 --> 1:00:10.240]  Big brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[1:00:10.240 --> 1:00:11.240]  You want answers?
[1:00:11.240 --> 1:00:19.680]  Well, so does he, he's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network and now, live from Austin,
[1:00:19.680 --> 1:00:22.680]  Texas, Alex Jones.
[1:00:22.680 --> 1:00:33.760]  All right, coming up at the 24 after, I'm going to start simulcasting at PrisonPlanet.tv,
[1:00:33.760 --> 1:00:41.360]  it's been an hour and 35 minutes roughly, debunking the popular mechanics, debunking
[1:00:41.360 --> 1:00:48.080]  that's coming up reportedly tonight, Monday, April 6 on the Glenbeck Phony Conservative
[1:00:48.080 --> 1:00:52.400]  Phony Patriot Program, so that is coming up this evening.
[1:00:52.400 --> 1:01:00.400]  Okay, here's the most important thing I can say about Raw Story, the Pittsburgh Post-Cousette,
[1:01:00.400 --> 1:01:06.920]  Media Matters, Little Green Footballs, the Neocon website, all of them.
[1:01:06.920 --> 1:01:11.440]  They are trying to get gas mileage against free speech in the Second Amendment, the
[1:01:11.440 --> 1:01:16.640]  First and Second Amendment, out of the depths of these four officers and that's just a despicable
[1:01:16.640 --> 1:01:19.640]  disgusting horrible thing to do.
[1:01:19.640 --> 1:01:24.760]  You know, I had enough class before this thing became a big national story because, I mean,
[1:01:24.760 --> 1:01:29.480]  if I was just a cold-blooded cynical person that just wanted attention to this show,
[1:01:29.480 --> 1:01:34.760]  I would have told my webmasters, make a big deal out of this, make sure this goes nationwide
[1:01:34.760 --> 1:01:41.080]  by posting it on my websites and I said, no, shut it down, don't post anything about this
[1:01:41.080 --> 1:01:47.640]  because I don't want the attention from my radio show off of this, but it went big so
[1:01:47.640 --> 1:01:51.360]  now I have to defend myself and we are doing that.
[1:01:51.360 --> 1:01:54.960]  That's the sick thing, no weapon formed against us so prosper.
[1:01:54.960 --> 1:01:59.080]  I mean, every time I get attacked by the media, the government, low-level people, other
[1:01:59.080 --> 1:02:01.120]  patriots, it only makes us bigger.
[1:02:01.120 --> 1:02:05.720]  I mean, have any of you numbskulls figured that out and frankly, I don't enjoy how big
[1:02:05.720 --> 1:02:06.720]  we're getting.
[1:02:06.720 --> 1:02:10.760]  It's starting to really freak me out that we're reaching tens of millions of people
[1:02:10.760 --> 1:02:14.280]  and that the whole world is starting to pay attention to what we do and that even the
[1:02:14.280 --> 1:02:16.120]  mainstream media is having to admit that.
[1:02:16.120 --> 1:02:21.440]  I mean, I've got an incredible weight on my shoulders because I know this is for real.
[1:02:21.440 --> 1:02:23.440]  I understand this is the real world.
[1:02:23.440 --> 1:02:24.440]  This isn't some game.
[1:02:24.440 --> 1:02:27.120]  This isn't about Alex Jones being a celebrity.
[1:02:27.120 --> 1:02:32.640]  A lot of you wish for that because Madison Avenue has told you that that's the ultimate
[1:02:32.640 --> 1:02:33.640]  in life.
[1:02:33.640 --> 1:02:34.640]  When in truth, it's a cage.
[1:02:34.640 --> 1:02:36.640]  It is a prison.
[1:02:36.640 --> 1:02:41.520]  So be careful what you wish for.
[1:02:41.520 --> 1:02:48.400]  So that said, the media knows this makes me bigger.
[1:02:48.400 --> 1:02:52.640]  They want to use me as an archetype to demonize the First Amendment, the Second Amendment
[1:02:52.640 --> 1:02:55.320]  and that is disgusting.
[1:02:55.320 --> 1:03:00.680]  That said, it is not Barack Obama's fault because people can't be governed by what
[1:03:00.680 --> 1:03:01.680]  others do.
[1:03:01.680 --> 1:03:06.840]  You know, it was this young man's decision to do what he did and it's heinous and terrible
[1:03:06.840 --> 1:03:10.600]  shooting these three police officers and killing and wounding two others because mommy was
[1:03:10.600 --> 1:03:13.400]  throwing him out of the house.
[1:03:13.400 --> 1:03:18.640]  But it's also heinous to have Barack Obama pushing for total gun bans and having his
[1:03:18.640 --> 1:03:24.280]  attorney general file briefings at the Supreme Court saying so and to have the mainstream
[1:03:24.280 --> 1:03:27.400]  media claim we're making this up and it isn't true.
[1:03:27.400 --> 1:03:32.200]  And I called this Pittsburgh Post Gazette reporter up and I said, what's your problem,
[1:03:32.200 --> 1:03:33.200]  buddy?
[1:03:33.200 --> 1:03:35.720]  What's your deal?
[1:03:35.720 --> 1:03:43.560]  Why are you calling me a conspiracy theorist and saying this stuff's basically made up
[1:03:43.560 --> 1:03:51.520]  when you know that the attorney general called for total gun ban and he wouldn't answer that.
[1:03:51.520 --> 1:03:54.000]  So that's going on.
[1:03:54.000 --> 1:04:03.080]  But the big issue here, the $64 million question and the $64 million answer is this.
[1:04:03.080 --> 1:04:05.240]  They have turned government against the people.
[1:04:05.240 --> 1:04:07.240]  They have taught the government that the people are bad.
[1:04:07.240 --> 1:04:09.120]  They've taught the people the government's bad.
[1:04:09.120 --> 1:04:13.840]  They hype up bad examples of police and police brutality to further compact the police into
[1:04:13.840 --> 1:04:21.120]  a gang mentality and to give the police this feeling of invincibility and great power.
[1:04:21.120 --> 1:04:25.840]  And Hollywood has put out the image of police in black uniforms with submachine guns descending
[1:04:25.840 --> 1:04:28.480]  on the public.
[1:04:28.480 --> 1:04:33.280]  That in turn scares the public, drives them away from the police, causes an arms race amongst
[1:04:33.280 --> 1:04:36.480]  the public and an arms race amongst the police.
[1:04:36.480 --> 1:04:41.600]  And now they've got us divided as two armies to fight with each other, divide and conquer
[1:04:41.600 --> 1:04:44.440]  instead of bringing the New World Order to justice.
[1:04:44.440 --> 1:04:48.840]  So I'm going to come back, finish up with this and then just go through the incredible
[1:04:48.840 --> 1:04:53.600]  stories that say, I made up the fact that they're planning to put troops on the streets
[1:04:53.600 --> 1:04:55.960]  and I make up the New World Order.
[1:04:55.960 --> 1:05:01.160]  Doesn't matter if it's being announced all over international television and print.
[1:05:01.160 --> 1:05:02.480]  So you want to stop smoking.
[1:05:02.480 --> 1:05:03.880]  Well, here's what I want you to do.
[1:05:03.880 --> 1:05:06.560]  Go to a drug store and take a stop smoking product off the shelf.
[1:05:06.560 --> 1:05:07.680]  Go to the cashier.
[1:05:07.680 --> 1:05:09.120]  Tell them you don't want to pay for the product.
[1:05:09.120 --> 1:05:10.800]  You just want to take it home and try it.
[1:05:10.800 --> 1:05:14.640]  And if and only if you stop smoking, will you then come back and pay for it.
[1:05:14.640 --> 1:05:16.560]  Most likely if you tried this, you'd be arrested.
[1:05:16.560 --> 1:05:18.800]  But as silly as this sounds, this is exactly what the smoke is.
[1:05:18.800 --> 1:05:21.000]  The smoke free free trial offer is.
[1:05:21.000 --> 1:05:24.720]  Smoke free is a complete all natural stop smoking system and when you call today, they'll

[1:05:40.440 --> 1:05:41.560]  while you're trying to quit.

[1:05:45.600 --> 1:05:47.360]  quit for life with smoke free.

[1:06:01.280 --> 1:06:06.600]  In the new world order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[1:06:06.600 --> 1:06:13.360]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong,
[1:06:13.360 --> 1:06:14.680]  just as well funded.
[1:06:14.680 --> 1:06:19.800]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest
[1:06:19.800 --> 1:06:21.280]  of the American people.
[1:06:21.280 --> 1:06:25.680]  Well Obama's already fudging, fudged since day one in this election.
[1:06:25.680 --> 1:06:30.800]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing
[1:06:30.800 --> 1:06:37.320]  the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[1:06:37.320 --> 1:06:40.880]  It's not about left or right, it's about a one world government.
[1:06:40.880 --> 1:06:47.800]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[1:08:02.560 --> 1:08:09.120]  From his central Texas command center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[1:08:09.120 --> 1:08:14.000]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[1:08:14.000 --> 1:08:26.760]  Alright, boiling it all down, as millions and millions of Americans, now more than six
[1:08:26.760 --> 1:08:31.400]  million total, that's a conservative number, have been out of work for months and months,
[1:08:31.400 --> 1:08:34.560]  in some cases years.
[1:08:34.560 --> 1:08:38.120]  And there are waiting lines to get jobs at McDonald's, there are waiting lines to get
[1:08:38.120 --> 1:08:43.760]  jobs as pizza delivery people, there are lines to get jobs to clean out dog poop at the local
[1:08:43.760 --> 1:08:49.560]  vets, you know, there are lines everywhere to get basic jobs, and you've got people with
[1:08:49.560 --> 1:08:54.920]  college degrees who are married, have two or three children, they can't pay for their
[1:08:54.920 --> 1:09:01.200]  house, their cars, they can't even live at a subsistence level, they can't even survive
[1:09:01.200 --> 1:09:04.600]  on five, six, seven, eight dollars an hour.
[1:09:04.600 --> 1:09:08.800]  Meanwhile, hundreds of new taxes are being raised, the public's being squeezed, there's
[1:09:08.800 --> 1:09:13.760]  police outrunning checkpoints everywhere, riding people tickets for the most petty of
[1:09:13.760 --> 1:09:19.680]  reasons, illegal aliens are above the law, and the public is getting madder and madder
[1:09:19.680 --> 1:09:21.840]  and madder.
[1:09:21.840 --> 1:09:27.040]  And you've got over a hundred million gun owners out of 300 million people in this country,
[1:09:27.040 --> 1:09:31.440]  you've got over a hundred million gun owners, many of them are committed to defend the Second
[1:09:31.440 --> 1:09:36.440]  Amendment to the death, if one percent of a hundred million gun owners decides to fight
[1:09:36.440 --> 1:09:44.640]  to the death, that is one million people, one million guerrilla fighters, there is no
[1:09:44.640 --> 1:09:47.800]  force on earth that can stop that door to door.
[1:09:47.800 --> 1:09:53.120]  There is nothing the establishment can do, but you see the establishment doesn't care
[1:09:53.120 --> 1:09:57.120]  about killing police and military, they don't care about societies falling apart.
[1:09:57.120 --> 1:10:01.480]  The IMF and World Bank documents that were leaked in December of 2001 that we publicized
[1:10:01.480 --> 1:10:06.720]  here talk about how they make societies break down with their economic policies, then people
[1:10:06.720 --> 1:10:11.880]  start rioting, police and military start getting killed, then everything collapses and then
[1:10:11.880 --> 1:10:17.120]  after six months to a year, the public rolls over to whatever the bankers wanted to do
[1:10:17.120 --> 1:10:24.040]  previously, because after six months of being homeless or starving to death and having battles
[1:10:24.040 --> 1:10:30.840]  with the police and military in which thousands died, then the people tend to come broke back
[1:10:30.840 --> 1:10:35.720]  to the government and so they want to have a conflict, they want to have huge shootouts
[1:10:35.720 --> 1:10:37.320]  with the police and military.
[1:10:37.320 --> 1:10:42.240]  The social engineers want the breakdown of society, they want there to be a war between
[1:10:42.240 --> 1:10:46.120]  the people.
[1:10:46.120 --> 1:10:53.760]  This is their goal, this is what they're pushing for, this is what they want.
[1:10:53.760 --> 1:11:00.200]  This is how they operate and that's how they break down a society.
[1:11:00.200 --> 1:11:05.560]  That's what Hitler did, that's what Stalin did, they create special cadres that work
[1:11:05.560 --> 1:11:18.240]  for the government, they create special cadres that feel like there's an us against them
[1:11:18.240 --> 1:11:22.000]  mentality, they tell them they're special, they're elite, they're defending the state,
[1:11:22.000 --> 1:11:32.920]  they're holding up society and then they march the two groups against each other.
[1:11:32.920 --> 1:11:37.520]  And then the ensuing crisis that is created, then the establishment comes in and goes,
[1:11:37.520 --> 1:11:41.760]  oh my God, look at what's happened, see we can't allow a second amendment, oh see we
[1:11:41.760 --> 1:11:46.240]  can't allow free speech because look what it did to society, then there won't be a discussion
[1:11:46.240 --> 1:11:51.520]  about arresting the bankers, there won't be a discussion about bringing them to justice
[1:11:51.520 --> 1:11:55.440]  because the country will be in civil war.
[1:11:55.440 --> 1:12:00.320]  Now all of this could be bypassed, it's not too late and this weekend I saw Bill Moyers
[1:12:00.320 --> 1:12:05.800]  coming out with experts admitting the bankers engineered this and robbing everybody by design,
[1:12:05.800 --> 1:12:10.840]  I saw other television programs starting to talk about it, even mainstream, I heard neighbors
[1:12:10.840 --> 1:12:14.720]  talking about how it was engineered and how the bankers should be arrested, they've all
[1:12:14.720 --> 1:12:16.960]  committed major crimes.
[1:12:16.960 --> 1:12:23.600]  If we go and indict with evidence through the Constitution, through the grand juries,
[1:12:23.600 --> 1:12:29.880]  the Larry Summers and Alan Greenspan and Ben Bernacke and Tim Geithner and all of these
[1:12:29.880 --> 1:12:35.640]  criminals, we can take our government back, federalize the Federal Reserve, it'll all
[1:12:35.640 --> 1:12:40.440]  come out how they had special slush funds in the comprehensive annual financial reports
[1:12:40.440 --> 1:12:44.080]  and how they robbed the country blind and how they were planning to implode the economy
[1:12:44.080 --> 1:12:47.720]  to set up world government, that's now all admitted, they're openly announcing world
[1:12:47.720 --> 1:12:53.840]  government to be run by the banks, either we remove the criminal elite that's in power
[1:12:53.840 --> 1:13:02.440]  through due process, through the system, or the elite is just going to get more power
[1:13:02.440 --> 1:13:11.840]  on top of more power out of the crises that they have created and that's the choice.
[1:13:11.840 --> 1:13:16.960]  That's the choice, either we let them cause the implosion of society, massive crime increasing,
[1:13:16.960 --> 1:13:22.320]  looting, rioting, citizens being killed, police being killed, military being killed,
[1:13:22.320 --> 1:13:27.960]  as they play us all off against each other, race riots in the Southwest, burning cities,
[1:13:27.960 --> 1:13:29.640]  it's all coming.
[1:13:29.640 --> 1:13:36.520]  You can bet your bottom dollar on that and the government admits it's all coming.
[1:13:36.520 --> 1:13:41.080]  Or the American people come together and arrest the criminal elite and then it's still going
[1:13:41.080 --> 1:13:46.480]  to be hard to fix things, but if we come together and do that, that will be seen as reconciliation
[1:13:46.480 --> 1:13:50.640]  between the police, the military, the citizens, the general public, the different races, the
[1:13:50.640 --> 1:13:54.000]  different groups and we can reverse what's happened here.
[1:13:54.000 --> 1:13:58.240]  We can arrest Hitler, we can arrest his ministers and who is Hitler?
[1:13:58.240 --> 1:14:02.760]  It's the council on foreign relations, it's the trilateral commission, it's the Rockefellers,
[1:14:02.760 --> 1:14:07.040]  it's the big foundations, it's the Frank Church committee that exposed them all back in the
[1:14:07.040 --> 1:14:10.720]  70s, this is the corporate globalist crime syndicate.
[1:14:10.720 --> 1:14:16.120]  Either you arrest the mafia now in control of both branches of the political parties
[1:14:16.120 --> 1:14:19.640]  and all three branches of government or it's only going to get worse.
[1:14:19.640 --> 1:14:24.400]  These people engineered the Soviet takeover, they engineered the Nazi takeover, they engineered
[1:14:24.400 --> 1:14:28.920]  the Maoist takeover, they do this to consolidate control.
[1:14:28.920 --> 1:14:34.440]  They're launching a revolution of economic collapse and the military control over you
[1:14:34.440 --> 1:14:35.440]  right now.
[1:14:35.440 --> 1:14:42.480]  We're going into a time of just unbelievable havoc and danger right now.
[1:14:42.480 --> 1:14:47.400]  And mark my words, ladies and gentlemen, there are going to be a lot more police and military
[1:14:47.400 --> 1:14:49.640]  killed.
[1:14:49.640 --> 1:14:54.160]  By the time this is over, it's going to number in the tens of thousands of dead police and
[1:14:54.160 --> 1:14:58.720]  military patrolling the streets of America.
[1:14:58.720 --> 1:15:04.520]  And that is a travesty because not only are these men and women have children and families,
[1:15:04.520 --> 1:15:08.640]  most of them are just brainwashed, compartmentalized, they don't understand what they're part of,
[1:15:08.640 --> 1:15:15.600]  a lot of them are awake, only a small percentage are control freak bullies.
[1:15:15.600 --> 1:15:20.880]  And out of the controlled conflict that's coming, the establishment will use that as
[1:15:20.880 --> 1:15:25.880]  an excuse to bring in real tyranny against the American people in the next phase after
[1:15:25.880 --> 1:15:26.880]  that.
[1:15:26.880 --> 1:15:29.960]  And they are playing the police, military and citizens off against each other when
[1:15:29.960 --> 1:15:36.280]  we should all be together against the offshore bankers that are engineering all of this.
[1:15:36.280 --> 1:15:44.200]  So I will tell citizens, avoid conflict with the police and military at all cost, certainly
[1:15:44.200 --> 1:15:47.680]  don't go to the FEMA camp, certainly don't turn your guns in.
[1:15:47.680 --> 1:15:50.880]  They're committing crimes when they try to do that.
[1:15:50.880 --> 1:16:00.320]  But is this some new 1776 to have some 22-year-old guy having a fight with his mommy, kill some
[1:16:00.320 --> 1:16:04.600]  cops in a domestic dispute, no.
[1:16:04.600 --> 1:16:08.640]  The media is trying to make the patriot movement own this, they're trying to make it ours,
[1:16:08.640 --> 1:16:09.640]  no, it's yours.
[1:16:09.640 --> 1:16:13.600]  You're the ones announcing martial law, you're the ones announcing North American Union
[1:16:13.600 --> 1:16:17.000]  and New World Order from Time Magazine to the Wall Street Journal.
[1:16:17.000 --> 1:16:23.400]  You're the ones trying to push gun bans through Congress and through the Supreme Court.
[1:16:23.400 --> 1:16:25.400]  You own this, this is yours.
[1:16:25.400 --> 1:16:30.560]  You turn the police against the people or at least push that image.
[1:16:30.560 --> 1:16:33.880]  You created the us against them mentality.
[1:16:33.880 --> 1:16:36.960]  You committed all the crimes the New World Order has been involved in.
[1:16:36.960 --> 1:16:41.920]  The media, you defended the New World Order and told people it didn't exist and now you
[1:16:41.920 --> 1:16:46.000]  say it exists while at the same time saying it doesn't exist.
[1:16:46.000 --> 1:16:51.760]  You've lost all credibility, you own this and you own the conflict that's coming.
[1:16:51.760 --> 1:16:58.040]  I have every day said where this is leading, I have told you where this is leading.
[1:16:58.040 --> 1:17:05.800]  Dead citizens in blue uniforms and in plain clothes because we're all citizens piled up
[1:17:05.800 --> 1:17:11.280]  to the sun while the New World Order sits offshore rubbing their hands together enjoying
[1:17:11.280 --> 1:17:12.280]  it.
[1:17:12.280 --> 1:17:16.560]  But I'll tell you what, Raw Story and others, you look ridiculous when you write stories
[1:17:16.560 --> 1:17:22.280]  saying Pittsburgh shooter was fan of online conspiracy theories and then they go on to
[1:17:22.280 --> 1:17:23.840]  attack Glenn Beck.
[1:17:23.840 --> 1:17:31.960]  They said Edward Provock told the Post Gazette he was really into politics and really into
[1:17:31.960 --> 1:17:35.880]  the First and Second Amendment.
[1:17:35.880 --> 1:17:39.360]  He was apparently referring to so-called sovereign state movement so now it's bad to have that
[1:17:39.360 --> 1:17:40.360]  happening.
[1:17:40.360 --> 1:17:43.640]  The Post Gazette also mentions the conspiracy theory website, PrismPlanet.com, where I'm
[1:17:43.640 --> 1:17:50.400]  by radio talk show host Alex Jones as a source of some of Papalosky's more off-the-wall notions.
[1:17:50.400 --> 1:17:55.960]  Last fall, the site ran the article, U.S. troops in homeland crowd control patrols from
[1:17:55.960 --> 1:18:01.360]  October 1st which claimed that U.S. troops returning from duty in Iraq will be carrying
[1:18:01.360 --> 1:18:08.240]  out homeland patrols in America from October 1st in complete violation of the Posse Commentatus
[1:18:08.240 --> 1:18:15.960]  Act for the purpose of helping with civil unrest and crowd control which could include
[1:18:15.960 --> 1:18:21.120]  dealing with unruly Americans after a complete economic collapse.
[1:18:21.120 --> 1:18:24.400]  Now they go on to call me and nut a bunch of other names in these articles but the point
[1:18:24.400 --> 1:18:30.600]  is that article, that link they give is just a boil down page we made at PrismPlanet.com
[1:18:30.600 --> 1:18:37.440]  of the Washington Post seeing in Army Times where they announced for crowd control and
[1:18:37.440 --> 1:18:40.800]  for the breakdown of society after economic collapse.
[1:18:40.800 --> 1:18:45.600]  Those quotes are from the Washington Post and the Army Times.
[1:18:45.600 --> 1:18:53.800]  So see, I point at the Army Times and I get called a crazy conspiracy theorist off the
[1:18:53.800 --> 1:18:59.080]  wall and then get associated with some mad nut cop killer.
[1:18:59.080 --> 1:19:03.000]  The government building FEMA camps and announcing they're going to use troops against the American
[1:19:03.000 --> 1:19:07.400]  people is what's causing folks to get ready for war.
[1:19:07.400 --> 1:19:13.040]  And yes, you line up armies across a trench line from each other, you're going to start
[1:19:13.040 --> 1:19:17.080]  having people open fire without being given the order to.
[1:19:17.080 --> 1:19:21.520]  On both sides, you're going to have cops flipping out on citizens for no reason when they've
[1:19:21.520 --> 1:19:25.120]  got Ron Paul bumper stickers or libertarian stickers, then the citizens are going to
[1:19:25.120 --> 1:19:28.400]  hate the police, then the police are going to hate the citizens more and it's going
[1:19:28.400 --> 1:19:33.120]  to cause conflict because they are announcing new world order.
[1:19:33.120 --> 1:19:34.800]  They are announcing world government.
[1:19:34.800 --> 1:19:36.760]  They are announcing gun confiscation.
[1:19:36.760 --> 1:19:38.920]  They are announcing FEMA camps.
[1:19:38.920 --> 1:19:41.920]  And so you can't have it both ways.
[1:19:41.920 --> 1:19:47.120]  And then when we point at your mainstream news articles and then blame us for what you're
[1:19:47.120 --> 1:19:52.840]  doing that is certainly contributing to all of this happening, look, you start a war with
[1:19:52.840 --> 1:19:57.120]  the American people to get our guns, there's going to be blood in the streets and that's
[1:19:57.120 --> 1:20:01.800]  your fault, your fault.
[1:20:01.800 --> 1:20:09.200]  The new world order beast is genetically modifying your food, genetically modifying, mixing vegetables
[1:20:09.200 --> 1:20:14.680]  with animals and now experimenting with viruses.
[1:20:14.680 --> 1:20:23.040]  Without a long term food solution, you will have just two options, starve or surrender.
[1:20:23.040 --> 1:20:30.520]  All canned food supplies will eventually run out, what, then, then, then, then.
[1:20:30.520 --> 1:20:34.120]  Grow your own healthy food and feed your family forever.
[1:20:34.120 --> 1:20:38.080]  Survivalistseeds.com is now the nation's largest bulk heirloom seed company and it's
[1:20:38.080 --> 1:20:40.760]  owned by a real patriot, Big John Lipscomb.
[1:20:40.760 --> 1:20:45.040]  You can now have an infinite amount of healthy vegetables like a watermelon, a bundle of
[1:20:45.040 --> 1:20:48.480]  carrots or tomatoes for a little more than a penny each.
[1:20:48.480 --> 1:20:52.920]  Survivalistseeds.com and now you can go into business with Big John at Survivalist
[1:20:52.920 --> 1:21:01.440] seeds.com by becoming an affiliate, see his link at Survivalistseeds.com, Survivalistseeds.com.
[1:21:01.440 --> 1:21:07.520]  In the new world order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[1:21:07.520 --> 1:21:12.040]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of
[1:21:12.040 --> 1:21:13.360]  us would like to see.
[1:21:13.360 --> 1:21:18.480]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest
[1:21:18.480 --> 1:21:19.880]  of the American people.
[1:21:19.880 --> 1:21:24.280]  But Obama's already fudging, fudged since day one in this election.
[1:21:24.280 --> 1:21:29.400]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing
[1:21:29.400 --> 1:21:37.520]  the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[1:21:37.520 --> 1:21:41.080]  It's not about left to right, it's about a one-world government.
[1:21:41.080 --> 1:21:48.000]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[1:21:53.460 --> 1:21:56.200]  high quality at prisonplanet.tv.
[1:21:56.200 --> 1:22:01.120]  The Obama deception, the people strike back.
[1:22:01.120 --> 1:22:05.040]  Good day, Jim Newcomer from Minus Resources, April 6, 2009.
[1:22:05.040 --> 1:22:11.480]  Gold opened this morning at $877.30, a one-ounce gold coin to be purchased for $90301, $451.50
[1:22:11.480 --> 1:22:17.960]  for a half ounce, and $225.75 for the quarter ounce, that's $90301, $451.50, and $225.50
[1:22:17.960 --> 1:22:19.720]  for the quarter ounce.
[1:22:19.720 --> 1:22:24.240]  How is it that we, the people, grow the cotton, weave it into fabric, engrave the ink, embed
[1:22:24.240 --> 1:22:28.000]  the strips and fibers that protect it from counterfeit, then cart the money off to a
[1:22:28.000 --> 1:22:32.160]  privately owned bank to have it lent back to us at interest, forcing us to pay taxes
[1:22:32.160 --> 1:22:33.280]  to service the debt.
[1:22:33.280 --> 1:22:37.960]  Is this capitalism, or was Jefferson correct when he said, a central bank issuing a public
[1:22:37.960 --> 1:22:41.960]  currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[1:22:41.960 --> 1:22:46.480]  Hi, Ted Anderson, I'm placing a silver dollar inside of a book that explains how the monetary
[1:22:46.480 --> 1:22:47.480]  system works.
[1:22:47.480 --> 1:22:51.640]  Call for your copy, 1-800-686-2237.
[1:22:51.640 --> 1:22:53.600]  Isn't it time to understand the system?
[1:22:53.600 --> 1:23:05.000]  Call 800-686-2237, that's 800-686-2237.
[1:23:05.000 --> 1:23:06.600]  Let's go to the heart of the matter.
[1:23:06.600 --> 1:23:11.400]  Life-Changed T has had some commercials that are not appealing to those who live in denial.
[1:23:11.400 --> 1:23:16.600]  Maybe we are to believe there are no parasites in the world, and that having a clogged colon
[1:23:16.600 --> 1:23:21.640]  is good for you, that being overweight is absolutely healthy, that there are no unhealthy
[1:23:21.640 --> 1:23:23.320]  chemicals in the air.
[1:23:23.320 --> 1:23:30.480]  And last but not least, fluoride in your water is good for you, not get the T. Change your
[1:23:30.480 --> 1:23:33.560]  body and life from unhealthy to healthy.
[1:23:33.560 --> 1:23:43.080]  Order online at GetTheT.com, that's GetTheT.com, or you can call us at 928-308-0408, that's
[1:23:43.080 --> 1:23:54.280]  928-308-0408, or order online at GetTheT.com, that's GetTheT.com.
[1:23:54.280 --> 1:24:13.680]  Life-Changed T, the T that changes how you feel.
[1:24:13.680 --> 1:24:24.240]  Okay, for the next hour and 30 minutes, I am going to cover
[1:24:24.240 --> 1:24:29.040]  the reality of FEMA camps in the United States.
[1:24:29.040 --> 1:24:36.280]  How it's controlled by the National Security Council, who in turn controls FEMA.
[1:24:36.280 --> 1:24:44.200]  Presidential Decision Directive 51 is in place, basically declaring the American people slaves
[1:24:44.200 --> 1:24:48.600]  of the federal government and saying that Congress and the courts are ceremonial under
[1:24:48.600 --> 1:24:49.600]  the President.
[1:24:49.600 --> 1:24:54.360]  They've used continuity of government as a way to basically set up a dictatorship here
[1:24:54.360 --> 1:24:55.360]  in the United States.
[1:24:55.360 --> 1:25:04.520]  Now, I have made three police state films, I have also written books and news articles
[1:25:04.520 --> 1:25:11.600]  on the subject, and the problem is when you cover FEMA camps, is there's so much evidence,
[1:25:11.600 --> 1:25:17.960]  so many congressional hearings, so many news articles, so many documents, the problem is
[1:25:17.960 --> 1:25:19.480]  knowing where to start.
[1:25:19.480 --> 1:25:29.000]  But I will start this presentation right now by simply going over the fact that Glenn
[1:25:29.000 --> 1:25:35.120]  Beck a year and a half ago said that Ron Paul supporters should be arrested and that the
[1:25:35.120 --> 1:25:38.680]  Army should be used against them and that they were dangerous terrorists.
[1:25:38.680 --> 1:25:42.960]  And I've said, hey, I've read that in a lot of federal documents and a lot of police training
[1:25:42.960 --> 1:25:49.880]  manuals in the past and what Glenn Beck is saying is a talking point being given out
[1:25:49.880 --> 1:25:54.720]  to the media because we were seeing Bill O'Reilly and Sean Hannity say it, we were seeing CNN
[1:25:54.720 --> 1:26:01.680]  hosts say it, we were seeing Joe Scarborough say it, and I said that's a talking point.
[1:26:01.680 --> 1:26:05.440]  And then suddenly he started saying a few months ago, I'm going to expose the FEMA camps,
[1:26:05.440 --> 1:26:08.200]  I'm going to, I think they're real.
[1:26:08.200 --> 1:26:12.880]  And I said, well, look out, folks, he's just trying to get your confidence to then discredit
[1:26:12.880 --> 1:26:15.600]  it later.
[1:26:15.600 --> 1:26:19.600]  And that is indeed what Glenn Beck then did.
[1:26:19.600 --> 1:26:24.320]  He announced a few weeks ago, I'm going to have popular mechanics, the yellow journalist
[1:26:24.320 --> 1:26:28.080]  on to debunk all of this.
[1:26:28.080 --> 1:26:34.240]  And then you literally have Michael Chertoff's cousin running the division of the magazine
[1:26:34.240 --> 1:26:35.680]  that puts out these reports.
[1:26:35.680 --> 1:26:41.200]  You have this high level CIA operatives wife running it, you've got the 9-11 commission
[1:26:41.200 --> 1:26:46.920]  officially saying that that's sourcing popular mechanics as their source when the whole thing
[1:26:46.920 --> 1:26:51.680]  is full of mistakes and disinformation just on the 9-11 front.
[1:26:51.680 --> 1:27:04.200]  But on this subject of popular mechanics saying that they are going to debunk FEMA camps,
[1:27:04.200 --> 1:27:11.320]  they've really stepped in it because the FEMA camps are on record in triplicate.
[1:27:11.320 --> 1:27:16.800]  Now I did some research this weekend just to pull up past documents, articles, things
[1:27:16.800 --> 1:27:23.040]  I had read in the past and therein lies the problem, trying to even cover it all.
[1:27:23.040 --> 1:27:29.760]  Here is the civilian inmate labor camp program Army regulation 210-35 and we're simulcasting
[1:27:29.760 --> 1:27:35.400]  the radio show at prisonplanet.tv so we'll put that up on screen for folks that are
[1:27:35.400 --> 1:27:37.480]  watching.
[1:27:37.480 --> 1:27:42.560]  Civilian inmate labor camp program, we're going to be going over that for folks, we're
[1:27:42.560 --> 1:27:50.600]  going to go over the official government documents and news articles about FEMA camps from mainstream
[1:27:50.600 --> 1:27:58.000]  news, I have that folder and things that tie in to the FEMA camps, mainstream mass grave
[1:27:58.000 --> 1:28:02.720]  news articles and internal government documents about mass graves for the American people,
[1:28:02.720 --> 1:28:07.560]  the rumors in, the documentation begins, I thought I'd go over the executive orders
[1:28:07.560 --> 1:28:14.080]  for martial law and document those public pieces of material for you to go check out
[1:28:14.080 --> 1:28:19.760]  for anybody who's questioning, the public being prepared for martial law and the FEMA
[1:28:19.760 --> 1:28:26.840]  camps and troops on the streets, that ties into martial law and FEMA camps and a bunch
[1:28:26.840 --> 1:28:33.760]  of different videos where Congress and others are being threatened with martial law and
[1:28:33.760 --> 1:28:41.320]  this is only again a small amount of the material we're going to go over in this presentation.
[1:28:41.320 --> 1:28:48.040]  I would ask listeners to check out every claim we're going to make for yourself because the
[1:28:48.040 --> 1:28:55.080]  biggest problem we do have going for us is that most of the stuff I see on the internet
[1:28:55.080 --> 1:29:02.520]  is speculation or rumors or they'll go show a closed Amtrak station and they'll say this
[1:29:02.520 --> 1:29:09.840]  is a FEMA camp and they'll show the ticketing area where it'll have red signs for these
[1:29:09.840 --> 1:29:15.760]  tickets and blue signs for those ticket holders and it's not a FEMA camp and when Glenn Beck
[1:29:15.760 --> 1:29:20.720]  does his debunking, he says he's going to do tonight, I have predicted that he will go
[1:29:20.720 --> 1:29:27.320]  with the straw man argument, he will show where people have been looking for FEMA camps
[1:29:27.320 --> 1:29:33.720]  and been incorrect instead of all of this material that he won't touch, now I'm told
[1:29:33.720 --> 1:29:37.720]  he went ahead and covered it on his radio show today and did quote debunk things and
[1:29:37.720 --> 1:29:41.800]  it's on TV tonight as well but we're going to go ahead and go through all this and then
[1:29:41.800 --> 1:29:46.000]  you can go back and see his debunking and see if our predictions were right, the predictions
[1:29:46.000 --> 1:29:51.280]  I've made for the last few weeks, stay with us, we'll go through it all and we get back.
[1:29:51.280 --> 1:30:01.520]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run, Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[1:30:01.520 --> 1:30:05.800]  You worry, you see the signs and worry about the future, you worry about economic turmoil
[1:30:05.800 --> 1:30:09.960]  and food shortages, how to be prepared while preserving your sanity, your answer may be
[1:30:09.960 --> 1:30:14.760]  at hand, author Linda Runyon lived off the land isolated from civilization, she knows
[1:30:14.760 --> 1:30:19.160]  that as long as the sun shines, there will be plenty of free food all over God's green
[1:30:19.160 --> 1:30:23.640]  earth, perhaps the only sane insurance is knowledge of wild edible plants.
[1:30:23.640 --> 1:30:28.280]  The cost of learning is minimal, wild food grows everywhere and you will see it everywhere,
[1:30:28.280 --> 1:30:31.780]  it's every bit organic and more nutritious than our modern diets.
[1:30:31.780 --> 1:30:36.160]  Well respected in her field, Linda's approach to teaching this subject includes books, flashcards
[1:30:36.160 --> 1:30:40.440]  and video with an emphasis on health, safety, practicality and joy.
[1:30:40.440 --> 1:30:45.160]  And how to identify it, where and when to find it, how to prepare use and store it.
[1:30:45.160 --> 1:30:49.400]  Go to Linda's website ofthefield.com and take advantage of special offers, or if you're

[1:30:55.600 --> 1:31:01.600]  888-51-EAT-FREE, a little knowledge makes starvation impossible.
[1:31:01.600 --> 1:31:15.000]  On the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[1:31:15.000 --> 1:31:20.160]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest
[1:31:20.160 --> 1:31:21.640]  of the American people.
[1:31:21.640 --> 1:31:26.040]  Well Obama's already fudging, fudged since day one in this election.
[1:31:26.040 --> 1:31:31.160]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing
[1:31:31.160 --> 1:31:37.680]  the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[1:31:37.680 --> 1:31:41.240]  It's not about left or right, it's about a one world government.
[1:31:41.240 --> 1:31:48.160]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told and his real agenda.
[1:31:48.160 --> 1:31:53.720]  Get your copy of the Obama deception today at infowars.com or download it in super high
[1:31:53.720 --> 1:32:01.080]  quality at prisonplanet.tv, the Obama deception, the people strike back.
[1:32:01.080 --> 1:32:06.240]  You already know that drinking pure high alkaline pH water is the most important factor in maintaining
[1:32:06.240 --> 1:32:08.420]  high energy and vibrant health.
[1:32:08.420 --> 1:32:13.320]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 8 or higher.
[1:32:13.320 --> 1:32:18.560]  Alkavision plasma pH drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline ingredients.
[1:32:18.560 --> 1:32:23.080]  Using plasma pH drops is one of the best ways to make your water alkaline, to help you get
[1:32:23.080 --> 1:32:26.160]  rid of acid and regain your health and energy.
[1:32:26.160 --> 1:32:31.760]  Simply put 10 drops per liter of water you drink to raise the pH to the ultimate level.
[1:32:31.760 --> 1:32:36.200]  Alkalizing water helps your body rid itself of acidic waste and increases the oxygen content
[1:32:36.200 --> 1:32:37.520]  of your body.
[1:32:37.520 --> 1:32:43.080]  Disease organisms like bacteria and cancer cannot survive in an alkaline high pH environment.
[1:32:43.080 --> 1:32:48.840]  Order your bottle of alkavision plasma pH drops now by going directly to alkavision.com
[1:32:48.840 --> 1:33:00.360]  that's alkavision.com or by calling 269-216-9767, 269-216-9767 today.
[1:16:31.780 --> 1:33:33.720]  I want to know if the FEMA camps are real.
[1:33:33.720 --> 1:33:34.720]  I'm doing research.
[1:33:34.720 --> 1:33:36.560]  I don't know if they're real.
[1:33:36.560 --> 1:33:42.520]  We said okay, we did an hour long simulcast with the radio show on the web at prisonplanet.tv
[1:33:42.520 --> 1:33:47.800]  and I showed congressional hearings, Miami Herald articles, admitting shadow government
[1:33:47.800 --> 1:33:54.200]  FEMA camps for martial law, we showed the bills for martial law, the John Warner Defense
[1:33:54.200 --> 1:34:01.040]  Authorization Act, PDD 51 and we put together that video, it went viral on YouTube, we emailed
[1:34:01.040 --> 1:34:05.200]  it to Glenn Beck, we mailed letters to Glenn Beck, I know people that work in his office,
[1:34:05.200 --> 1:34:10.280]  I contacted him and I said here's the proof, if he wants it, we stand by to work with Mr.
[1:34:10.280 --> 1:34:14.640]  Beck if he isn't going to come out next week and say arrest all of us basically like he
[1:34:14.640 --> 1:34:16.840]  was doing a year ago.
[1:34:16.840 --> 1:34:22.040]  And sure enough, Glenn Beck comes out and says the FEMA camps aren't real, there's
[1:34:22.040 --> 1:34:27.080]  a kernel of truth in the FEMA camps, but when we hear there's this massive plan to take
[1:34:27.080 --> 1:34:29.080]  over, it's not true.
[1:34:29.080 --> 1:34:34.480]  And he says I'm going to have, coming up in a few weeks, which is today, on Fox Television,
[1:34:34.480 --> 1:34:40.920]  I'm going to have popular mechanics on to debunk all of this.
[1:34:40.920 --> 1:34:44.480]  Well from that, we'll see if we're right tonight, I'm told he's doing his radio show
[1:34:44.480 --> 1:34:50.600]  right now and trying to debunk it, but we'll see if we were right, that he will build strong
[1:34:50.600 --> 1:34:51.600]  men.
[1:34:51.600 --> 1:34:52.600]  Now why is this important?
[1:34:52.600 --> 1:34:56.280]  Fox News and the establishment have Glenn Beck come out, they try to get our confidence
[1:34:56.280 --> 1:35:00.240]  and then they tell us that FEMA camps don't exist.
[1:35:00.240 --> 1:35:05.200]  When we know the FEMA camps exist and the government has stated how they plan to roll
[1:35:05.200 --> 1:35:09.600]  out the use of the FEMA camps against the American people.
[1:35:09.600 --> 1:35:15.400]  So let's go ahead and start with this now.
[1:35:15.400 --> 1:35:28.160]  Up on screen are photocopies of the Miami Herald and this goes back into the 1980s when
[1:35:28.160 --> 1:35:35.200]  they had congressional hearings dealing with shadow government and martial law.
[1:35:35.200 --> 1:35:40.840]  Here's the headline, the secret government and it talks about secret summits, a plan
[1:35:40.840 --> 1:35:46.160]  to take over the government and it shows the people that were in charge of the continuity
[1:35:46.160 --> 1:35:50.040]  of government, Dick Cheney and others.
[1:35:50.040 --> 1:35:59.160]  And then we have a congressional hearing where we have Congressman Jack Brooks and others
[1:35:59.160 --> 1:36:05.480]  during Iran Contra bringing up the secret plans and they're told by congressmen in a
[1:36:05.480 --> 1:36:09.160]  way that that can't be discussed, it's a national security issue.
[1:36:09.160 --> 1:36:14.840]  So let's go ahead and play that clip and it goes to Henry Began Zollis of Texas saying
[1:36:14.840 --> 1:36:17.960]  yes, under a crisis they could bring in martial law.
[1:36:17.960 --> 1:36:18.960]  Here it is.
[1:36:18.960 --> 1:36:25.840]  Colonel North, in your work at the NSC, were you not assigned at one time to work on plans
[1:36:25.840 --> 1:36:34.200]  for the continuity of government in the event of a major disaster, Mr. Chairman?
[1:36:34.200 --> 1:36:40.240]  I believe that question touches upon a highly sensitive and classified area.
[1:36:40.240 --> 1:36:46.040]  So may I request that you not touch upon that, sir?
[1:36:46.040 --> 1:36:53.440]  I was particularly concerned, Mr. Chairman, because I read in Miami papers and several
[1:36:53.440 --> 1:37:04.040]  others that there had been a plan developed by that same agency, a contingency plan in
[1:37:04.040 --> 1:37:08.360]  the event of an emergency that would suspend the American Constitution, and I was deeply
[1:37:08.360 --> 1:37:13.080]  concerned about it and wondered if that was the area in which he had worked.
[1:37:13.080 --> 1:37:15.280]  I believe that he was, but I wanted to get in touch with him.
[1:37:15.280 --> 1:37:21.040]  May I most respectfully request that that matter not be touched upon at this stage.
[1:37:21.040 --> 1:37:26.920]  If we wish to get into this on certain arrangements can be made for an executive session.
[1:37:26.920 --> 1:37:32.080]  And tragically, the only member who got closed was Jack Brooks, and he was stopped by the
[1:37:32.080 --> 1:37:33.080]  Chairman.
[1:37:33.080 --> 1:37:37.240]  But the truth of the matter is that yes, you do have those standby provisions, and the
[1:37:37.240 --> 1:37:44.640]  plans are there, and the statutory emergency plans are there whereby you could, in the
[1:37:44.640 --> 1:37:55.000]  name of stopping terrorism, apprehend, invoke the military, and arrest Americans and hold
[1:37:55.000 --> 1:37:57.440]  them in detention camps.
[1:37:57.440 --> 1:38:07.600]  In times of passion and in times of great fear, what, to the eyes of the person and the mind
[1:38:07.600 --> 1:38:13.920]  of a person in time of relative peace and stability seem impossible, become very real,
[1:38:13.920 --> 1:38:16.840]  very logical, very possible.
[1:38:16.840 --> 1:38:17.840]  All right.
[1:38:17.840 --> 1:38:23.640]  Now, that is from my film, Police State to the Takeover, made in late 1999.
[1:38:23.640 --> 1:38:27.040]  And I'm going over government sponsored terror, how they're going to stage terror attacks
[1:38:27.040 --> 1:38:28.240]  to bring in martial law.
[1:38:28.240 --> 1:38:32.200]  They would incrementally train us to accept troops on the streets.
[1:38:32.200 --> 1:38:34.600]  And we have a whole stack of news there just this weekend.
[1:38:34.600 --> 1:38:39.120]  Just on Friday, Tennessee newspapers reported they were going to have regular army running
[1:38:39.120 --> 1:38:46.400]  checkpoints on the highways with the police, as Brigade Homeland has announced, as the
[1:38:46.400 --> 1:38:49.360]  Army Times, as North Com is announced.
[1:38:49.360 --> 1:38:50.760]  Our listeners got upset.
[1:38:50.760 --> 1:38:54.360]  The governor was called, and we've got that coming up, and they suspended that.
[1:38:54.360 --> 1:38:58.320]  But still, we got photographs of other Marine Corps drills going on.
[1:38:58.320 --> 1:39:00.340]  So they're acclimating the public.
[1:39:00.340 --> 1:39:04.080]  You have car wrecks, the trips show up.
[1:39:04.080 --> 1:39:09.080]  You have drunk driving checkpoints, the Marines are there, again, acclimating you.
[1:39:09.080 --> 1:39:13.280]  Another flight for people in car wrecks, the troops, mass shooting in Alabama, regular
[1:39:13.280 --> 1:39:15.440]  army show up.
[1:39:15.440 --> 1:39:18.000]  This is part of the acclimation.
[1:39:18.000 --> 1:39:23.200]  Now, I could go through this all day.
[1:39:23.200 --> 1:39:24.880]  Again, there's so many pieces of evidence.
[1:39:24.880 --> 1:39:29.760]  Let's next go to modern times, then I'll go back into the executive orders and the bills
[1:39:29.760 --> 1:39:36.800]  and actual numbers you can check for yourselves.
[1:39:36.800 --> 1:39:44.080]  Let's go ahead and go to congressmen a year and a half ago on the Homeland Security Board
[1:39:44.080 --> 1:39:47.280]  wanting to know about PDD 51.
[1:39:47.280 --> 1:39:49.920]  Now, this fight went on for a year.
[1:39:49.920 --> 1:39:54.680]  The cover sheet of Presidential Decision Directive 51 stated the president's a dictator.
[1:39:54.680 --> 1:39:57.880]  Congress has no power during any emergency, including economic.
[1:39:57.880 --> 1:40:02.000]  So now, Congress isn't involved in continuity of government when Congress is co-equal to
[1:40:02.000 --> 1:40:03.280]  the president and the courts.
[1:40:03.280 --> 1:40:06.960]  In fact, the founding fathers said Congress was above the courts and the president, but
[1:40:06.960 --> 1:40:11.360]  then later courts said, no, they're equal, now they're saying they're not, okay, because
[1:40:11.360 --> 1:40:16.640]  it's harder for a dictator to take control in the Congress because there's 500 people,
[1:40:16.640 --> 1:40:17.640]  separation of powers.
[1:40:17.640 --> 1:40:21.320]  The president is where your main dictator will come from, so it's the weakest.
[1:40:21.320 --> 1:40:27.320]  It follows the orders of Congress and then executes those orders.
[1:40:27.320 --> 1:40:31.760]  But then the chairman of the Homeland Security Committee said, I am co-equal with the president
[1:40:31.760 --> 1:40:34.320]  of National Security, let me see PDD 51.
[1:40:34.320 --> 1:40:36.120]  They were told, no.
[1:40:36.120 --> 1:40:40.440]  But the cover sheet alone states the president's a dictator.
[1:40:40.440 --> 1:40:47.320]  Then we see last year PDD 51 being executed and members of Congress, Senator Inhofe and
[1:40:47.320 --> 1:40:52.600]  others being told, martial law will be declared if you don't hand total control and immunity
[1:40:52.600 --> 1:40:54.040]  over to the banks.
[1:40:54.040 --> 1:40:55.680]  And they followed orders and did it.
[1:40:55.680 --> 1:40:58.040]  So the martial law is now in place.
[1:40:58.040 --> 1:41:00.380]  And with that comes the FEMA camps.
[1:41:00.380 --> 1:41:01.920]  Will we get to that place?
[1:41:01.920 --> 1:41:02.920]  Not if we expose it.
[1:41:02.920 --> 1:41:05.680]  But we're already got our neck in the noose here.
[1:41:05.680 --> 1:41:07.080]  Is the execution going to pull the lever?
[1:41:07.080 --> 1:41:08.080]  I don't know.
[1:41:08.080 --> 1:41:11.600]  But it's not going to help having Glenn Beck denying all this is happening.
[1:41:11.600 --> 1:41:16.640]  Let's continue with the congressmen talking about PDD 51.
[1:41:16.640 --> 1:41:21.960]  Most Americans would agree that it would be prudent to have a plan to provide for the
[1:41:21.960 --> 1:41:27.160]  continuity of government and the rule of law in case of a devastating terrorist attack
[1:41:27.160 --> 1:41:32.360]  or natural disaster plan to provide for the cooperation, the coordination, and continued
[1:41:32.360 --> 1:41:35.280]  functioning of all three branches of the government.
[1:41:35.280 --> 1:41:39.160]  The Bush administration tells us they have such a plan.
[1:41:39.160 --> 1:41:45.360]  They introduced a little sketchy public version that's clearly inadequate and doesn't really
[1:41:45.360 --> 1:41:47.560]  tell us what they have in mind.
[1:41:47.560 --> 1:41:48.560]  But they said, don't worry.
[1:41:48.560 --> 1:41:51.200]  There's a detailed, classified version.
[1:41:51.200 --> 1:41:56.920]  But now they've denied the entire Homeland Security Committee of the United States House
[1:41:56.920 --> 1:42:03.880]  of Representatives access to their so-called detailed plan to provide for continuity of
[1:42:03.880 --> 1:42:04.880]  government.
[1:42:04.880 --> 1:42:06.080]  They say, trust us.
[1:42:06.080 --> 1:42:07.080]  Trust us.
[1:42:07.080 --> 1:42:11.960]  The people who brought us Katrina to be competent in face of a disaster.
[1:42:11.960 --> 1:42:12.960]  Trust us.
[1:42:12.960 --> 1:42:19.680]  The people who brought us warrantless wiretapping and other excesses eroding our civil liberties.
[1:42:19.680 --> 1:42:21.240]  Trust us.
[1:42:21.240 --> 1:42:25.560]  Maybe the plan just really doesn't exist, and that's why they won't show it to us.
[1:42:25.560 --> 1:42:29.400]  I don't know, or maybe there's something there that's outrageous.
[1:42:29.400 --> 1:42:36.440]  The American people need their elected representatives to review this plan for the continuity of
[1:42:36.440 --> 1:42:37.440]  government.
[1:42:37.440 --> 1:42:38.440]  The gentleman's time has expired.
[1:42:38.440 --> 1:42:40.120]  For what purpose is the gentleman from Texas right?
[1:42:40.120 --> 1:42:41.120]  All right.
[1:42:41.120 --> 1:42:42.120]  All right.
[1:42:42.120 --> 1:42:43.120]  That's Congressman Peter DeFazio.
[1:42:43.120 --> 1:42:45.280]  Now, that was a year and a half ago.
[1:42:45.280 --> 1:42:50.160]  Mr. DeFazio, the cover sheet says the president's a dictator, and that Congress has no authority
[1:42:50.160 --> 1:42:51.840]  over continuity of government.
[1:42:51.840 --> 1:42:55.640]  That's why they're now saying Congress can't see it because they're declaring and executing
[1:42:55.640 --> 1:42:57.560]  that power.
[1:42:57.560 --> 1:43:01.080]  That's why the vice president's heard saying he was above Congress and above the executive
[1:43:01.080 --> 1:43:07.160]  and in his own area of government declaring new imaginary powers.
[1:43:07.160 --> 1:43:10.560]  That's why the White House chief of staff and the top lawyers and chief counsel were
[1:43:10.560 --> 1:43:14.600]  writing the president was God and could order the torture of children in front of their
[1:43:14.600 --> 1:43:15.600]  parents.
[1:43:15.600 --> 1:43:19.920]  This is the furor of precept or saying the leader is the law.
[1:43:19.920 --> 1:43:26.040]  Now, we fast forward a year plus to October 3rd.
[1:43:26.040 --> 1:43:29.080]  And here is Congressman Sherman, who we interviewed here on air.
[1:43:29.080 --> 1:43:33.040]  Other congressmen we interviewed and Senator Inhofe saying they marched in and told them
[1:43:33.040 --> 1:43:36.360]  martial law will be declared if you don't do this.
[1:43:36.360 --> 1:43:41.280]  So, so we go from the 80s to where don't talk about the martial law plans and the FEMA
[1:43:41.280 --> 1:43:42.280]  camps.
[1:43:42.280 --> 1:43:45.760]  If you want to know about that, you know about it in executive session, Congressman Jack
[1:43:45.760 --> 1:43:49.880]  Brooks to, oh, Congress, you're not allowed to see the plans now.
[1:43:49.880 --> 1:43:55.160]  To, Congress, do what we say we're under martial law.
[1:43:55.160 --> 1:43:59.320]  Now, now, you want proof of martial law, proof of FEMA camps?
[1:43:59.320 --> 1:44:00.320]  Here it is.
[1:44:00.320 --> 1:44:02.040]  Go ahead and play it.
[1:44:02.040 --> 1:44:08.520]  The only way they can pass this bill is by creating and sustaining a panic atmosphere.
[1:44:08.520 --> 1:44:11.840]  That atmosphere is not justified.
[1:44:11.840 --> 1:44:18.280]  Many of us were told in private conversations that if we voted against this bill on Monday
[1:44:18.280 --> 1:44:23.240]  that the sky would fall, the market would drop two or three thousand points the first
[1:44:23.240 --> 1:44:28.280]  day, another couple thousand the second day, and a few members were even told that there
[1:44:28.280 --> 1:44:32.960]  would be martial law in America if we voted no.
[1:44:32.960 --> 1:44:38.000]  That's what I call fear-mongering, unjustified, proven wrong.
[1:44:38.000 --> 1:44:41.640]  We've got a week, we've got two weeks to write a good bill.
[1:44:41.640 --> 1:44:46.000]  The only way to write, to pass a bad bill, keep the panic pressure on.
[1:44:46.000 --> 1:44:48.240]  Now, what has the Senate done to this bill?
[1:44:48.240 --> 1:44:50.320]  All right, said exactly.
[1:44:50.320 --> 1:44:55.360]  And now they've passed more bailouts, more stimulus packages, total federalization, federalization
[1:44:55.360 --> 1:44:58.680]  of health records, federalization of the Internet.
[1:44:58.680 --> 1:44:59.680]  It's all happening.
[1:44:59.680 --> 1:45:03.720]  All, I mean, Mother Jones admits Obama is quote, taking over the Internet and preparing
[1:45:03.720 --> 1:45:04.720]  to shut it down.
[1:45:04.720 --> 1:45:06.720]  That's what the bill says.
[1:45:06.720 --> 1:45:08.520]  Even liberals are admitting this is happening.
[1:45:08.520 --> 1:45:10.720]  See, it was all about Bush was going to do this.
[1:45:10.720 --> 1:45:13.280]  No Bush was a puppet.
[1:45:13.280 --> 1:45:20.800]  Just like Nixon and Carter and Reagan and Bush and Clinton and Bush and Obama, they're
[1:45:20.800 --> 1:45:26.560]  just puppets and we always obsess over them and the media acts like they're running something.
[1:45:26.560 --> 1:45:30.120]  It's the executive power held by the National Security Council.
[1:45:30.120 --> 1:45:34.760]  In fact, three weeks ago, they had an article about General James Jones and the National
[1:45:34.760 --> 1:45:38.840]  Security Council saying they've now taken over continuity of government even from the
[1:45:38.840 --> 1:45:43.120]  executive and Homeland Security and that this private group runs it all.
[1:45:43.120 --> 1:45:50.520]  And then General Jones was in the CFR website saying, writing, I take all my orders from
[1:45:50.520 --> 1:45:54.560]  former national security heads, Henry Kissinger and the CFR.
[1:45:54.560 --> 1:46:00.520]  I mean, that's why in the last week, there have been four mainstream news articles that
[1:46:00.520 --> 1:46:05.600]  we posted at infoawards.com and prisonplanet.com with Bilderberg group members like Etienne
[1:46:05.600 --> 1:46:09.720]  Davignon, the chairman of Bilderberg saying, we set up the European Union.
[1:46:09.720 --> 1:46:11.560]  We set up the G20.
[1:46:11.560 --> 1:46:14.200]  We've set up the New World Order banking system.
[1:46:14.200 --> 1:46:18.800]  I mean, now they're openly bragging its world government and they run it.
[1:46:18.800 --> 1:46:24.160]  And then if I dare talk about it and go, look, Etienne Davignon told the EU observer, he
[1:46:24.160 --> 1:46:27.880]  told the newspaper this, they go, shut up, Jones.
[1:46:27.880 --> 1:46:30.200]  You crazy nut, none of that exists.
[1:46:30.200 --> 1:46:32.700]  And if you talk about it, you're going to cause violence.
[1:46:32.700 --> 1:46:35.520]  Just give into the New World Order, roll over to it.
[1:46:35.520 --> 1:46:40.920]  Put your guns in.
[1:46:40.920 --> 1:46:42.560]  And I get back to this thing about Glenn Beck.
[1:46:42.560 --> 1:46:47.000]  I mean, it's ridiculous to say that we're not going into tyranny.
[1:46:47.000 --> 1:46:53.120]  When PDD 51 says the president is a dictator, go read it for yourself.
[1:46:53.120 --> 1:46:57.200]  When the John Ward Defense Authorization Act says the governor's served at the pleasure
[1:46:57.200 --> 1:47:03.480]  of the president, the Pentagon issued a directive six months ago saying their job is now crowd
[1:47:03.480 --> 1:47:07.120]  control and that the governor's served at the pleasure of the president or dual-headed
[1:47:07.120 --> 1:47:10.000]  officers and they've issued 1404.10.
[1:47:10.000 --> 1:47:14.720]  In fact, I forgot to print that for this presentation.
[1:47:14.720 --> 1:47:16.200]  There's just so much racing through my mind.
[1:47:16.200 --> 1:47:22.000]  I want to document, Google that story that we wrote about Aaron knows about it.
[1:47:22.000 --> 1:47:23.000]  Get him to print it.
[1:47:23.000 --> 1:47:27.120]  The one about Pentagon creates new civilian force.
[1:47:27.120 --> 1:47:28.120]  I need that.
[1:47:28.120 --> 1:47:29.120]  I think it's 1404.10.
[1:47:29.120 --> 1:47:36.760]  But I want to be exact on that with folks.
[1:47:36.760 --> 1:47:39.680]  And so we've got all of this here.
[1:47:39.680 --> 1:47:46.360]  Now I've already covered.
[1:47:46.360 --> 1:47:51.400]  Now let's go ahead and get to this.
[1:47:51.400 --> 1:47:58.000]  I mean, you want to see what goes with FEMA camps like a horse and carriage, troops, militarized
[1:47:58.000 --> 1:48:03.200]  police, training with the army to take over your cities and towns.
[1:48:03.200 --> 1:48:07.800]  Now the Pentagon has now announced all of this and we're going to get to that in a moment.
[1:48:07.800 --> 1:48:14.240]  But first, let's go ahead and play this YouTube clip, Martial Law is coming from News 7 at
[1:48:14.240 --> 1:48:15.240]  11.
[1:48:15.240 --> 1:48:16.240]  Okay.
[1:48:16.240 --> 1:48:20.200]  Let's go ahead and play this clip for folks and we have hundreds of these around the country
[1:48:20.200 --> 1:48:24.440]  as the police and military train to take over your towns and cities.
[1:48:24.440 --> 1:48:25.560]  Here it is.
[1:48:25.560 --> 1:48:31.880]  The scenario was a fake, but the pepper spray and billy clubs used to break up this riot
[1:48:31.880 --> 1:48:34.440]  were definitely real.
[1:48:34.440 --> 1:48:35.440]  Good evening.
[1:48:35.440 --> 1:48:36.440]  I'm Miranda Stevens.
[1:48:36.440 --> 1:48:41.280]  Whether it's terrorism, riots or any major disaster, local agencies will be the first
[1:48:41.280 --> 1:48:42.280]  to respond.
[1:48:42.280 --> 1:48:47.520]  That's why Roanoke City wants its disaster training to be as real as possible.
[1:48:47.520 --> 1:48:53.120]  Jeremy Butterfield has more.
[1:48:53.120 --> 1:48:57.880]  It's supposed to look like a riot and the scene at William Fleming High School had all
[1:48:57.880 --> 1:48:58.880]  the elements.
[1:48:58.880 --> 1:49:03.920]  I'm one of the rioters that the guard and the police force had to take down an arrest
[1:49:03.920 --> 1:49:06.760]  and did very successfully.
[1:49:06.760 --> 1:49:09.680]  In this scenario, everyone has a role to play.
[1:49:09.680 --> 1:49:14.760]  The rioters were ready to fight back as Roanoke police, Roanoke fire, local national guard
[1:49:14.760 --> 1:49:20.040]  troops and members of the Virginia Defense Force secured perimeters and moved in to make
[1:49:20.040 --> 1:49:23.200]  the arrest.
[1:49:23.200 --> 1:49:28.200]  Prior to 9-11, these organizations couldn't communicate and did not work together.
[1:49:28.200 --> 1:49:33.440]  They worked to support each other, but not together, and with the recent events of the
[1:49:33.440 --> 1:49:39.440]  last three to five years, we've become very good at working together, which is very important.
[1:49:39.440 --> 1:49:41.800]  Of course, these weren't real rioters.
[1:49:41.800 --> 1:49:46.360]  The rebels and t-shirts were all members of one of the participating agencies, but you
[1:49:46.360 --> 1:49:48.760]  couldn't tell that during the exercise.
[1:49:48.760 --> 1:49:53.200]  If you weren't protected by an orange vest signifying you as an observer, you were in
[1:49:53.200 --> 1:49:58.560]  danger of being hit by eggs, bottles, billy clubs or even the occasional well-placed
[1:49:58.560 --> 1:50:00.440]  round from a sniper.
[1:50:00.440 --> 1:50:03.840]  We try to make this very real, give a real feel to it.
[1:50:03.840 --> 1:50:09.920]  We had some, the fire department invited some live burning out here, so we had smoke, flames,
[1:50:09.920 --> 1:50:11.880]  objects being thrown, a lot of chaos.
[1:50:11.880 --> 1:50:15.000]  There's going to be a lot of chaos in a civil disturbance situation, and that's what we
[1:50:15.000 --> 1:50:17.960]  want to try to incorporate as much as possible.
[1:50:17.960 --> 1:50:19.800]  Working work plays a major role.
[1:50:19.800 --> 1:50:23.880]  Mountain Police had to coordinate with the fire department, while National Guard troops
[1:50:23.880 --> 1:50:27.120]  marched in formation toward the rioters.
[1:50:27.120 --> 1:50:32.840]  Without cooperation throughout all the agencies, the rioters would have quickly taken control.
[1:50:32.840 --> 1:50:35.200]  I think everybody learned a little bit.
[1:50:35.200 --> 1:50:40.000]  Mistakes are made, but we'd rather make those mistakes here than in a real situation.
[1:50:40.000 --> 1:50:44.520]  This was the fourth year the agencies have participated in this drill, and organizers
[1:50:44.520 --> 1:50:46.040]  say the old adage, practice-
[1:50:46.040 --> 1:50:49.880]  All right, pause it there, we're going to come back and finish up the end of that report.
[1:50:49.880 --> 1:50:53.880]  And we've got a ton more coming up, a whole other hour and five minutes, as I break down
[1:50:53.880 --> 1:50:56.200]  the reality of the FEMA camps.
[1:50:56.200 --> 1:51:01.400]  Stay with us.
[1:51:01.400 --> 1:51:06.640]  Did you know that the new energy czar wants to control how much power your electrical company
[1:51:06.640 --> 1:51:08.240]  allows you to have?
[1:51:08.240 --> 1:51:14.840]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[1:51:14.840 --> 1:51:16.280]  Not if, but when.
[1:51:16.280 --> 1:51:21.120]  Hi Bill, I just wanted to call in and let you folks know that I got my solar backup generator
[1:51:21.120 --> 1:51:22.120]  hooked up and running.
[1:51:22.120 --> 1:51:24.120]  To tell you the truth, it's awesome.
[1:51:24.120 --> 1:51:28.840]  Not only was it easy to install, but it's powering my fridge, lights, TV, and shortwave
[1:51:28.840 --> 1:51:29.840]  radio.
[1:51:29.840 --> 1:51:33.040]  I now know that I'm one step closer to getting off the grid.
[1:51:33.040 --> 1:51:34.160]  Thanks for all your help.
[1:51:34.160 --> 1:51:38.960]  This generator is solar powered, complete with battery backup, has no moving parts to wear
[1:51:38.960 --> 1:51:41.480]  out or break, and requires no gas.
[1:51:41.480 --> 1:51:46.200]  Don't wait for the energy czar to cut your power or raise your rates, produce your own
[1:51:46.200 --> 1:51:47.960]  electricity for free.
[1:51:47.960 --> 1:52:01.520]  Go to mysolarbackup.com, that's mysolarbackup.com, or call 877-327-0365, 877-327-0365.
[1:52:01.520 --> 1:52:07.640]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[1:52:07.640 --> 1:52:12.120]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of
[1:52:12.120 --> 1:52:13.440]  us would like to see.
[1:52:13.440 --> 1:52:18.600]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest
[1:52:18.600 --> 1:52:19.800]  of the American people.
[1:52:19.800 --> 1:52:24.360]  While Obama's already fudging, he's fudged since day one in this election.
[1:52:24.360 --> 1:52:29.440]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing
[1:52:29.440 --> 1:52:37.520]  the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[1:52:37.520 --> 1:52:41.160]  It's not about left or right, it's about a one-world government.

[1:54:10.760 --> 1:54:15.400]  army checkpoints searching American citizens called the governor's office heard about it
[1:54:15.400 --> 1:54:20.080]  from this radio show and stopped it and he talked to the governor.
[1:54:20.080 --> 1:54:23.440]  So we'll talk to the state rep who talked to the governor and got this stopped over
[1:54:23.440 --> 1:54:27.960]  the weekend coming up instead of just playing him on the local news we can have a state
[1:54:27.960 --> 1:54:35.000]  rep for you who narrowly stopped regular army running checkpoints in Tennessee.
[1:54:35.000 --> 1:54:39.680]  And then see you talk about this in mainstream rights articles about me like I'm crazy making
[1:54:39.680 --> 1:54:45.200]  up troops and troop deployments when it's the army times the army war college hundreds
[1:54:45.200 --> 1:54:49.360]  of newspapers have announced it and then I say hey that's tyranny and they go shut up
[1:54:49.360 --> 1:54:55.160]  Jones doesn't exist now I've got all these video clips I'm trying to get done with now
[1:54:55.160 --> 1:54:59.480]  and then I'll get into all the articles about FEMA camps bill numbers executive orders all
[1:54:59.480 --> 1:55:06.680]  of it for you we're going to be covering it but let's go ahead and finish up with this
[1:55:06.680 --> 1:55:11.480]  one case and this is everywhere of the police training with the military the National Guard
[1:55:11.480 --> 1:55:17.240]  now federalized for civil disturbances and then I have video clips of them taking people
[1:55:17.240 --> 1:55:24.160]  to a FEMA camp in Seattle during the 99 thing this is the continuity of government situation
[1:55:24.160 --> 1:55:29.520]  and how is Glenn Beck debunking it I had predicted tonight we'll see if I'm right that he will
[1:55:29.520 --> 1:55:35.800]  do a straw man and focus on the websites that are getting it wrong and we'll document that
[1:55:35.800 --> 1:55:39.680]  coming up as well here it is then a real situation.
[1:55:39.680 --> 1:55:44.200]  This was the fourth year the agencies have participated in this drill and organizers
[1:55:44.200 --> 1:55:50.000]  say the old adage practice makes perfect certainly holds true in the face of disaster
[1:55:50.000 --> 1:55:55.080]  Jeremy Butterfield new seven Roanoke well guess you can never be too prepared something
[1:55:55.080 --> 1:56:00.360]  we should all keep in mind this week as we prepare for more rain isn't that right that's
[1:56:00.360 --> 1:56:04.280]  right our preparation is going to be take the umbrella as you head out tomorrow morning
[1:56:04.280 --> 1:56:14.160]  in fact a lot of let's go ahead and play the clergy response team clip now remember
[1:56:14.160 --> 1:56:21.080]  a year and a half before this was on local news in Louisiana on local news in Idaho and
[1:56:21.080 --> 1:56:29.360]  several other states before this became national news we got the secret documents from pastors
[1:56:29.360 --> 1:56:34.640]  who have been recruited by FEMA we posted the secret documents with FEMA phone numbers
[1:56:34.640 --> 1:56:38.880]  train your flocks to turn their guns in train your flocks to go to FEMA camps train your
[1:56:38.880 --> 1:56:43.120]  flocks to take force inoculations people didn't believe us just like they didn't believe the
[1:56:43.120 --> 1:56:49.640]  myack report then suddenly local news began reporting it but like it was a good thing
[1:56:49.640 --> 1:56:54.720]  now listen well martial law ever be a reality and the preachers are there being paid by
[1:56:54.720 --> 1:57:00.480]  the government faith based initiative now continuing under Obama to tell their flocks
[1:57:00.480 --> 1:57:04.280]  to do what they're told by the authorities and the government's biggest threat is the
[1:57:04.280 --> 1:57:10.960]  American people that's a quote so this is specifically the pastors getting ready for
[1:57:10.960 --> 1:57:15.120]  us to go to FEMA camps and there's thousands of pieces of evidence like this and Glenn
[1:57:15.120 --> 1:57:20.760]  Beck saying it doesn't exist here it is some fear any nuclear biological or chemical attack
[1:57:20.760 --> 1:57:26.520]  on US territory might trigger just that and as case lay news 12 Jeff Farrell discovered
[1:57:26.520 --> 1:57:30.780]  the clergy would help the government with potentially their biggest problem stop it
[1:57:30.780 --> 1:57:35.600]  guys back it up it cut off about a second where she says martial law what folks to hear
[1:57:35.600 --> 1:57:43.240]  the full clip law ever become a reality in America some fear any nuclear biological or
[1:57:43.240 --> 1:57:49.040]  chemical attack on US territory might trigger just that and as case lay news 12 Jeff Farrell
[1:57:49.040 --> 1:57:54.400]  discovered the clergy would help the government with potentially their biggest problem us
[1:57:54.400 --> 1:58:01.680]  from my cold yeah you have Charlton Heston's famous declaration captures a truly American
[1:58:01.680 --> 1:58:08.000]  value the overarching desire to protect our freedoms but gun confiscation is exactly
[1:58:08.000 --> 1:58:12.800]  what happened during the state of emergency following Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans
[1:58:12.800 --> 1:58:18.560]  US troops also arrived something far easier to do even now thanks to last year's elimination
[1:58:18.560 --> 1:58:27.440]  of the 1878 posse comatotus act that forbid US troops from policing on American soil if
[1:58:27.440 --> 1:58:31.920]  martial law weren't acted here at home like depicted in the movie the sea stay there we're

[2:00:12.720 --> 2:00:21.680]  he's alex jones on the gcm radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[2:00:24.640 --> 2:00:29.360]  okay so they're building fema camps all over the country it's in the houston chronicle it's in
[2:00:29.360 --> 2:00:34.240]  roiders it's in the associated press they're announcing they're preparing for civil emergency
[2:00:34.240 --> 2:00:38.560]  have clergy response teams training their flocks to turn their guns in go to fema camps
[2:00:38.560 --> 2:00:42.480]  they're announcing everywhere troops are going to patrol the streets and mainstream news
[2:00:42.480 --> 2:00:46.960]  and then glenn back comes out and says i'm one of you on the patriot i've done an investigation
[2:00:46.960 --> 2:00:52.480]  none of this exists here's popular mechanics the government mouthpiece and so i'm going through
[2:00:52.480 --> 2:00:55.840]  some of the past stuff and then we're going to really get into all the documentation coming up
[2:00:55.840 --> 2:01:00.400]  the next segment but here are the clergy response teams back that up about 10 seconds i want them
[2:01:00.400 --> 2:01:06.320]  to hear that if martial law ever becomes a reality it will be the pastors who pacify the public now
[2:01:06.320 --> 2:01:13.200]  remember secret fema program it was secret don't tell the public we're gonna pay you to read this
[2:01:13.200 --> 2:01:18.240]  to your flock tell them take shots tell them turn their guns in tell them roman's 13 to submit to a
[2:01:18.240 --> 2:01:24.640]  government takeover okay they're paying them to do this that's why your church has got new vans
[2:01:24.640 --> 2:01:30.240]  and television sets and suddenly you're hearing the your preacher say this how creepy and unamerican
[2:01:30.240 --> 2:01:35.040]  is that total violation of the first amendment congress will make no law respecting an establishment
[2:01:35.040 --> 2:01:39.200]  of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof but now they're public okay you expose
[2:01:39.200 --> 2:01:45.040]  our clergy response teams we'll just admit it here it is now thanks to last year's elimination
[2:01:45.040 --> 2:01:51.600]  of the 1878 posse comitatus act that forbid us troops from policing on american soil
[2:01:53.680 --> 2:01:58.720]  if martial law weren't acted here at home like depicted in the movie the siege easing public
[2:01:58.720 --> 2:02:04.000]  fears and quelling dissent would be critical and that's exactly what the clergy response team as
[2:02:04.000 --> 2:02:09.680]  it's called helped accomplish in new warrants the primary thing that we say to anybody is let's cooperate
[2:02:09.680 --> 2:02:14.080]  and get this thing over with and then we'll settle the differences once the crisis is over such
[2:02:14.080 --> 2:02:18.880]  clergy response teams would walk a tightrope between the needs of the government versus the
[2:02:18.880 --> 2:02:24.240]  wishes of the public in a lot of cases these clergy would already be known in the neighborhoods
[2:02:24.240 --> 2:02:29.760]  in which they're helping to diffuse that situation for the clergy one of the biggest tools that they
[2:02:29.760 --> 2:02:36.160]  will have in helping calm the public down or obey the law is the bible itself specifically
[2:02:36.160 --> 2:02:42.000]  romans romans 13 because the government is established by the lord you know and and that's
[2:02:42.000 --> 2:02:46.080]  what we believe in the christian faith that's what's stated in the scripture civil rights advocates
[2:02:46.080 --> 2:02:52.000]  believe the amount of public cooperation may depend largely on how long they expect a suspension
[2:02:52.000 --> 2:03:00.320]  of their rights might last jet ferrell ksl a news 12 reporting and so that's what they're doing getting
[2:03:00.320 --> 2:03:05.760]  you ready for martial law getting you ready to go to fema camps publicly announced but here's the
[2:03:05.760 --> 2:03:12.960]  problem and i've always pointed this out it's it's almost like it's on purpose people will show and
[2:03:12.960 --> 2:03:17.360]  i'm predicting lin back is going to attack us this way they're going to show the 1990s video
[2:03:17.360 --> 2:03:26.160]  of the closed down amtrak train system up by chicago they're going to do that and then what
[2:03:26.160 --> 2:03:33.520]  they're going to do is they're going to show the photos that are all over the web uh in mississippi
[2:03:33.520 --> 2:03:42.800]  and louisiana of mok bosnio herzegovina slash kosova training camps because the signs are in that
[2:03:42.800 --> 2:03:49.600]  you know slovic language where it has machine gun nests checkpoints barbed wire as a refugee camp
[2:03:49.600 --> 2:03:55.200]  and they send the troops through for drills and they're going to say see people said this
[2:03:55.200 --> 2:04:02.480]  was a camp it's not really a camp it's a place where they're doing drills oh see this is really
[2:04:02.480 --> 2:04:08.480]  just an amtrak train track we went out there and yeah it's got bar bar facing in but it's not really
[2:04:08.480 --> 2:04:14.640]  a camp they're not going to go over the executive orders that we're going to cover stating this
[2:04:14.640 --> 2:04:19.200]  they're not going to go over pd 51 they're not going to go over the military announcing they're
[2:04:19.200 --> 2:04:23.600]  getting ready for this they're not going to cover the houston chronicle if they do that's what they're
[2:04:23.600 --> 2:04:28.800]  talking about because he hinted at this two weeks ago but kernels of truth and yeah they are getting
[2:04:28.800 --> 2:04:33.680]  ready for emergencies but it's not a death camp you know it's a place for homeless people that's
[2:04:33.680 --> 2:04:40.240]  what the new bill says this is how they introduce the camps to you now you know it's not wrong to
[2:04:40.240 --> 2:04:44.480]  have the preacher secretly hired to tell you to go to a camp and to do what the government tells you
[2:04:44.480 --> 2:04:50.640]  and you know it's not wrong to have your guns taken i mean it's of the lord government's produced
[2:04:50.640 --> 2:04:56.320]  by the lord hitler said that roman's 13 gotta do it we'll be right back stay with us and if you

[2:08:55.280 --> 2:09:01.200]  is happening all the radio and tv in the nation under the emergency alert system in 96 under a
[2:09:01.200 --> 2:09:07.360]  federal law and executive order fema is wired into the transmitters themselves and cable to take
[2:09:07.360 --> 2:09:12.400]  over all the systems in broadcast anytime they want before the stations would tune to a signal
[2:09:12.400 --> 2:09:19.040]  themselves now that's out of their hands all of that's going on so see they've got the preachers
[2:09:19.040 --> 2:09:24.400]  they've got the citizens they've got the military prepared for martial law to go into fema camps
[2:09:27.040 --> 2:09:30.640]  and then we've got all these mainstream news articles like the houston chronicle

[2:09:53.600 --> 2:09:57.200]  how we reverse engineered it before they announced this and said this is what the camps will look
[2:09:57.200 --> 2:10:01.440]  like they're going to advertise as they make us all homeless with controlled economic collapse
[2:10:01.440 --> 2:10:09.200]  like we want to go to the fema camps and so that's how they're advertising these as a wonderful
[2:10:09.200 --> 2:10:13.920]  place you want to go to and that the pastors are going to be there and so that's how they first
[2:10:13.920 --> 2:10:22.320]  advertise them as things collapse new legislation authorizes fema camps in the united states
[2:10:24.400 --> 2:10:31.680]  here is wall street journal kbr awarded homeland security contract worth up to 385 million

[2:24:45.280 --> 2:24:52.640]  passed a law the nsa can spy on you without you know having it be a felony but by the way we've
[2:24:52.640 --> 2:24:58.400]  been doing it for 30 years it's when they want to openly announce they're doing it that they then
[2:24:58.400 --> 2:25:05.200]  pass a law and they say oh all these shut down military bases that they've been keeping refurbished
[2:25:05.200 --> 2:25:13.200]  and putting barbed wire facing in and putting in showers and bunks and we knew that those were to
[2:25:13.200 --> 2:25:18.880]  be the FEMA camps because in the FEMA documents and the congressional leaks and and from people
[2:25:18.880 --> 2:25:24.240]  that worked at the camps we knew and we would list the camps then we noticed when it was declassified

[2:33:51.680 --> 2:33:56.800]  and you never heard about it in the news you never heard about it in the media
[2:33:58.400 --> 2:34:03.840]  we had secret copies of this when i first got on air in about 95 96
[2:34:04.640 --> 2:34:07.680]  with just the cover sheet of it and people made fun of us and didn't believe it
[2:34:08.400 --> 2:34:11.120]  then it was declassified this is from army dot mill

[2:34:23.920 --> 2:34:28.880]  and they're taking photos of it and saying it's a camp oh look at this there's a kernel of truth
[2:34:28.880 --> 2:34:33.200]  they haven't introduced a bill for during emergencies to have FEMA places for folks to go
[2:34:34.000 --> 2:34:39.360]  i mean they've got to do that you know like katrina oh look at this this is an army training

[2:34:45.680 --> 2:34:50.720]  i know how popular mechanics operates i mean i was right about lindbeck setting you up when
[2:34:50.720 --> 2:34:54.640]  he said he was gonna expose the FEMA camps and i said you watch he's gonna debunk him
[2:34:56.160 --> 2:35:00.560]  i understand these people because he reads off a script ladies and gentlemen
[2:35:01.120 --> 2:35:06.240]  i know the sheet of music he's singing off of i know the next line in the in the in the chorus
[2:35:07.040 --> 2:35:12.880]  this stuff is scripted so you've got the uh civilian inmate labor camp program going strong
[2:35:12.880 --> 2:35:19.440]  we've gone over the executive orders then we have preparation how are they preparing the
[2:35:19.440 --> 2:35:25.840]  public when i saw this at the time i saw tommy franks and cigar aficionado i saw tommy franks

[2:37:42.640 --> 2:37:49.120]  police the governor got called our listeners called and the governor said we're not going to do this
[2:37:49.120 --> 2:37:53.040]  and it got canceled this is suddenly happening everywhere all the marines are doing a checkpoint
[2:37:53.040 --> 2:38:00.480]  for drugs oh the army showed up at the mass shooting oh see as they announce that they're
[2:38:00.480 --> 2:38:06.720]  getting rid of posse commentatus as they announce brigade homeland as they announce
[2:38:06.720 --> 2:38:13.360]  troops to patrol the streets of america army times so let's go ahead and play this clip from the
[2:38:13.360 --> 2:38:21.600]  state representative who called the governor's office here it is with homeland security and the
[2:38:21.600 --> 2:38:34.000]  251st moment back it up and started over this was on w n w w n w s 101.5 f m news channel with
[2:38:34.000 --> 2:38:39.840]  the state rep let's give them credit started over started over back it up started over highway 64
[2:38:39.840 --> 2:38:46.160]  within the wife of police department had plans to conduct a seat belt checkpoint on saturday
[2:38:46.160 --> 2:38:51.200]  april 4th at highway 64 within the city limits of whitewell the checkpoint was planned to be in
[2:38:51.200 --> 2:38:57.760]  conjunction with homeland security and the 251st military police in bolivar after learning about
[2:38:57.760 --> 2:39:04.400]  this i contacted representative johnny shaw who represents that area ask you about this representative
[2:39:04.400 --> 2:39:08.560]  shaw you you looked into this and can you tell me what you've learned and and where this stands
[2:39:08.560 --> 2:39:15.680]  now i can't uh actually this has been canceled some calls were made to the governor's office
[2:39:15.680 --> 2:39:22.400]  about this on uh earlier today this friday and of course the governor just simply said i don't
[2:39:22.400 --> 2:39:29.600]  need another headache and and of course it has been and i will say that it is it was a bad idea
[2:39:29.600 --> 2:39:35.600]  in the first place i mean during this climate in this day and time which we live and you imagined
[2:39:35.600 --> 2:39:42.240]  the army stopping you for a deep belt check you know so it's it really was a bad idea i don't think
[2:39:42.240 --> 2:39:46.400]  it'll happen again because i think it would have frightened more people than it would have helped
[2:39:46.400 --> 2:39:52.960]  and uh i'm glad the governor made that decision and uh we will probably try to make this never
[2:39:52.960 --> 2:39:58.400]  happens again we'll follow up with you on that sir and find out what steps are taken to protect
[2:39:58.400 --> 2:40:04.880]  to see that something like this uh is the public is notified in the future definitely we will
[2:40:04.880 --> 2:40:08.880]  because the public should have been notified if it was going to happen and as i said you know
[2:40:08.880 --> 2:40:15.200]  with the climate that we live in now if you can imagine uh your wife my wife a daughter or even
[2:40:15.200 --> 2:40:20.560]  son driving up on the situation like this i mean it could be a total panic i don't know whose idea
[2:40:20.560 --> 2:40:26.240]  this was is a bad idea and i'm going to make sure that i call all of the local authorities and ask
[2:40:26.240 --> 2:40:31.680]  them not to do this in the mall but if they should even attempt to make sure that they
[2:40:32.240 --> 2:40:38.080]  contact people like myself and make sure that people are notified as to what is going to happen
[2:40:38.080 --> 2:40:44.000]  thank you now this is being done to acclimate the public so they don't panic when troops take over
[2:40:44.000 --> 2:40:48.560]  the city hall the county the state and it's in john warren defense authorization act it's in the
[2:40:48.560 --> 2:40:54.480]  pentagon directive they recently put out last year with brigade homeland that the governors serve
[2:40:54.480 --> 2:41:00.720]  at the pleasure of the president and they are prepared to take over the legislatures just like
[2:41:00.720 --> 2:41:06.400]  they threaten congress with martial law they didn't do what the president said this is high treason
[2:41:06.400 --> 2:41:11.920]  and obama has taken all these new powers that bush claimed and has expanded them day one
[2:41:11.920 --> 2:41:19.760]  and suddenly the left that was against it isn't saying a thing now let's go ahead and go over
[2:41:19.760 --> 2:41:27.040]  these articles i was just attacked by raw story and a bunch of other publications saying this
[2:41:27.040 --> 2:41:35.120]  doesn't exist brigade homeland tour starts october 1st third infantry's first bct trains for new
[2:41:35.920 --> 2:41:41.520]  dwell time mission helping people at home may become a permanent part of active army and then
[2:41:41.520 --> 2:41:47.120]  you read this the washington post reported it everybody else did it says for riot control and
[2:41:47.120 --> 2:41:52.480]  civil unrest during a collapse of society then the army war college came out a month later and
[2:41:52.480 --> 2:41:58.800]  said yes we're preparing to engage the american people and the new rules of engagement we've shown
[2:41:58.800 --> 2:42:03.200]  you the military training with local police to engage the american people getting ready for
[2:42:03.200 --> 2:42:09.280]  martial law getting ready for fema camps all being announced for decades they've been preparing this
[2:42:09.280 --> 2:42:14.320]  and then it accelerates right as they have the controlled implosion of the economy so there's

[2:42:19.920 --> 2:42:25.360]  troops to be deployed for domestic security they then expanded and said it won't be 4 000 troops
[2:42:25.360 --> 2:42:31.360]  it'll be 20 000 and this was in december 1st now four months ago now they're saying oh it'll be 40
[2:42:31.360 --> 2:42:37.760]  000 regular army troops the very troops that were in bagdad doing gun confiscation the very best

[2:46:18.080 --> 2:46:22.080]  click on the documents you can call the phone numbers these are real documents just like the

[2:46:34.880 --> 2:46:41.600]  many dead bodies they can bury and how fast at their facilities so all we're doing is documenting
[2:46:41.600 --> 2:46:48.240]  that they mass graves and incinerators ready and that's a fact now people then go out and
[2:46:48.240 --> 2:46:54.240]  investigate and sometimes they're right sometimes they're wrong just like uh in the 90s this fema
[2:46:54.240 --> 2:46:58.800]  camp stuff came out and people went out and showed government facilities and said my buddy worked in
[2:46:58.800 --> 2:47:03.120]  there and says they're going to use that army base under marshal law and then later it came out that
[2:47:03.120 --> 2:47:10.160]  indeed that army base is designated you know aniston and others in alabama then glenn beck
[2:47:10.160 --> 2:47:16.320]  points at that and says look that isn't that's just an army base it's not a camp or other people go
[2:47:16.320 --> 2:47:23.440]  show the trained facilities that aren't fema camps officially and then they say oh see you're discredited
[2:47:23.440 --> 2:47:28.800]  see they ignore all these mountains of real evidence and the admissions the government admitting
[2:47:28.800 --> 2:47:35.600]  they're doing this and then always go and find some person who's wrong or mistaken or who may
[2:47:35.600 --> 2:47:41.120]  be right they just don't have total proof uh that's how they operate there so there are the mass

[2:54:19.920 --> 2:54:25.520]  who called the governor and wouldn't let the army run warless checkpoints cops doing that's
[2:54:25.520 --> 2:54:31.120]  illegal but see now it's the army's here to search the citizens with homeland security
[2:54:31.680 --> 2:54:36.160]  that's outside the feds jurisdiction so they won't control the borders but they're going to
[2:54:36.160 --> 2:54:41.600]  control you the milk cows throughout history criminals get control of governments they use
[2:54:41.600 --> 2:54:46.560]  phony crises to enslave the public and they're taking your pension funds they're taking your money
[2:54:46.560 --> 2:54:51.120]  they're raising the taxes on you they are going to squeeze the daylights out of us all and that's
[2:54:51.120 --> 2:54:55.600]  why they're geared up for martial law and to take the media over because this is quite a gamble by
[2:54:55.600 --> 2:55:00.000]  the establishment you know we should have grand juries and guiding the bankers and having them
[2:55:00.000 --> 2:55:04.640]  turn states evidence against each other and this whole criminal shadow government national security
[2:55:04.640 --> 2:55:10.000]  state should be exposed instead it's acting all legitimate it's going to manage the financial
[2:55:10.000 --> 2:55:15.200]  crisis and it's going to manage everything it's engineered and bring in total tyranny and start
[2:55:15.200 --> 2:55:21.040]  arresting people for their speech so it either goes into tyranny or into liberty and believe me folks
[2:55:21.040 --> 2:55:24.960]  liberty is probably where it's going because this tyranny is so horrible they've got planned
[2:55:25.920 --> 2:55:30.160]  you know nine times out of ten lunatic tyrants try to take over and fail
[2:55:30.160 --> 2:55:35.200]  it's just in another tyrant comes in another tyrant comes so in the end they always win
[2:55:35.200 --> 2:55:39.840]  every nation falls to tyranny no nations ever survived as long as the united states
[2:55:39.840 --> 2:55:47.520]  rome fell in about 230 years we're 236 years old right now folks we're due to fall and frankly
[2:55:47.520 --> 2:55:51.680]  we've already fallen can we get it back you know the globalist have grabbed the republic and their
[2:55:51.680 --> 2:55:56.720]  jaws can we grab it back or will we let the bulldog of the neural order convinces that it's his to
[2:55:56.720 --> 2:56:02.800]  eat you know that he can go ahead and gobble it all down into his greedy belly so that's what I
[2:56:02.800 --> 2:56:07.200]  say to all of you this is history it's happening they're openly announcing bank of the world world
[2:56:07.200 --> 2:56:12.720]  government they're openly announcing that will pay our taxes to a new bank of the world and then
[2:56:12.720 --> 2:56:17.920]  that it's a world government and global governance google global governance in in google news hundreds
[2:56:17.920 --> 2:56:21.840]  of mainstream articles saying global governance global governance governance means government
[2:56:25.120 --> 2:56:30.640]  it's everywhere new global currency it's all happening by the very criminals that have engineered
[2:56:30.640 --> 2:56:36.000]  this and if they can get the slide of hand down if they can get the hidden in plain view completed
[2:56:36.000 --> 2:56:41.200]  if they can engage in this heist that they win and get a world empire the first ever but if we
[2:56:41.200 --> 2:56:45.200]  say wait a minute what you're doing is criminal what you're doing is illegal what you're doing is
[2:56:45.200 --> 2:56:52.400]  out of control they fall they fail we get our country back but if they can play the police
[2:56:52.400 --> 2:56:56.800]  in military and the public off against each other if they can get a shooting or started if they can
[2:56:56.800 --> 2:57:01.440]  convince the cops to go for the guns it's going to be a total implosion of our society and then
[2:57:01.440 --> 2:57:06.640]  they win we want to stop that and stop that now and that's why it's important to expose the military
[2:57:06.640 --> 2:57:13.440]  takeover the fema camps the mass graves all of it because this agenda this internet media takeover
[2:57:13.440 --> 2:57:20.000]  barack obama taken over the web this is all happening and it's bipartisan in closing for this hour

[3:08:33.600 --> 3:08:39.040]  he hosts the oracle of max kaiser on bbc world news previously produced and appeared regularly in
[3:08:39.040 --> 3:08:44.560]  tv series people in power and algezera english network max also presents a weekly radio show
[3:08:44.560 --> 3:08:50.400]  about finance and markets on london's resonance fm max also writes for the hovegan post in addition
[3:08:50.400 --> 3:08:55.840]  to his broadcasting work kaiser is known for his invention and virtual specialist technology that
[3:08:55.840 --> 3:09:00.800]  revolutionize a lot of what you see today a software system used by the hollywood stock exchange
[3:09:00.800 --> 3:09:05.280]  virtual trading system kaiser has also been described as the michael more of wall street
[3:09:05.280 --> 3:09:11.280]  both for his controversial uh confrontational humorous delivery and because his character
[3:09:11.280 --> 3:09:16.320]  and his critics considered him a sensationalist left winger i wouldn't call him a left winger
[3:09:16.320 --> 3:09:20.000]  because i certainly agree with a lot of his views about the corrupt globalists and the banks
[3:09:20.000 --> 3:09:24.000]  and we've got him here to talk about a host of issues he's gotten a lot of attention and being
[3:09:24.000 --> 3:09:30.480]  linked up on the drudge report talking about how uh the u.s british back banks will invade a country
[3:09:30.480 --> 3:09:35.120]  if they try to move to another currency or another uh... you know form of uh... world
[3:09:35.120 --> 3:09:40.560]  monetary unit he's also talked about how the economy imploding is a controlled emulation
[3:09:40.560 --> 3:09:46.480]  just like the towers so he's got a uh... lot of courage there with nine eleven truth statements
[3:09:46.480 --> 3:09:50.560]  and uh... so it's really great to have max kaiser on with us he's also agreed to come on
[3:09:50.560 --> 3:09:55.120]  though it's about two in the morning for him with jason barmas on wednesday night the info
[3:09:55.120 --> 3:10:01.600]  warrior nine at midnight here central uh... mister kaiser good to have you on with us
[3:10:04.160 --> 3:10:08.000]  okay max kaiser so much is going on now let's talk about the g twenty
[3:10:08.000 --> 3:10:12.800]  they're trying to push for a new global monetary bank the same bankers that engineered the crisis
[3:10:12.800 --> 3:10:14.560]  they're going to save us by giving them more power
[3:10:16.160 --> 3:10:20.560]  yeah well i tell you what before we get to the g twenty i thought i'd like review for you
[3:10:20.560 --> 3:10:26.560]  uh... the orchestration of the biggest wealth height in history okay you're ready for this
[3:10:26.560 --> 3:10:31.520]  uh... in two or three minutes i will relate to you about how the biggest wealth height in history
[3:10:31.520 --> 3:10:41.200]  took place are you ready for this go basically uh... going back to the nine eleven attack
[3:10:42.560 --> 3:10:50.080]  at that moment alex the rich people in america got really frightened because their notion was
[3:10:50.080 --> 3:10:56.480]  oh my god the barbarians are here what are we going to do and alan greenspan at the federal
[3:10:56.480 --> 3:11:04.240]  reserve bank at the time he took interest rates down to one percent now interest rates are the
[3:11:04.240 --> 3:11:11.360]  fulcrum upon which the entire u.s economy and the global economy functions low rates versus high
[3:11:11.360 --> 3:11:16.400]  rates this is the tension that we've seen in america going all the way back to oh you know you
[3:11:16.400 --> 3:11:20.640]  could say that when they introduced the federal reserve back in the nineteen thirteen era but
[3:11:20.640 --> 3:11:25.280]  it's interest rates that are the key now when greenspan lowered interest rates down to one
[3:11:25.280 --> 3:11:30.480]  percent after the attacks of nine eleven at the behest of the what you might call the elites
[3:11:30.480 --> 3:11:37.120]  in america because when you have low interest rates like that you can engineer incredible
[3:11:37.120 --> 3:11:42.960]  banking frauds and heists and what we've seen since that time is the banking system first
[3:11:42.960 --> 3:11:49.280]  accumulate hundreds of billions if not trillions of dollars of what we now call or not what we
[3:11:49.280 --> 3:11:55.440]  now know our counterfeit bonds stocks and options to the point where even gordon brown
[3:11:55.440 --> 3:12:02.560]  at the g twenty meeting referred to this whole system as the shadow banking system there is no
[3:12:02.560 --> 3:12:08.960]  a doubt now there is nobody hiding the fact that there is this huge shadow banking system
[3:12:08.960 --> 3:12:15.600]  that's at least twenty or thirty trillion dollars worth of trades that go on behind the stains are
[3:12:15.600 --> 3:12:23.360]  totally unreported this is why alex when geithner and these guys jump five ten twelve trillion
[3:12:23.360 --> 3:12:27.600]  dollars into these banks it doesn't seem to improve the situation at all because they're
[3:12:27.600 --> 3:12:33.120]  sitting on twenty thirty forty trillion dollars of fraudulent trade and this is all been building up
[3:12:33.840 --> 3:12:37.840]  since the nine eleven attacks they artificially dropped interest rates down to one percent
[3:12:37.840 --> 3:12:45.040]  which set in motion the dot com bubble when then that burst but instead of there being a recession
[3:12:45.040 --> 3:12:51.680]  it merely went into the real estate bubble that built up to extraordinary levels when that burst
[3:12:51.680 --> 3:12:56.800]  now they're faced with how are we going to create a new bubble and the new bubble is what we've
[3:12:56.800 --> 3:13:01.680]  talked about at the g twenty it's gordon brown he's talking about the imf he's talking about a
[3:13:01.680 --> 3:13:07.120]  global currency and this is how they're going to try to hide this twenty or thirty trillion or more
[3:13:07.120 --> 3:13:14.640]  in bogus counterfeit bonds and stocks by using now the imf the imf is not going to be the new global
[3:13:14.640 --> 3:13:19.840]  flush fund of choice and that's what we're seeing today what's it do what does it mean to people on
[3:13:19.840 --> 3:13:25.520]  the street to average americans it means that uh they're not going to have money to borrow it means
[3:13:25.520 --> 3:13:29.840]  the recession is going to get deeper it means there's a depression coming and it means that the
[3:13:29.840 --> 3:13:36.960]  bankers who have been basically using the system to confiscate all of this wealth are just getting
[3:13:36.960 --> 3:13:43.200]  better at it and they they're not about to turn around and start sharing that well by and what
[3:13:43.200 --> 3:13:46.640]  they would do if they were really interested in doing that is that they would raise interest rates
[3:13:46.640 --> 3:13:51.040]  because higher interest rates are what you and me and the saver want we want to return on our
[3:13:51.040 --> 3:13:56.240]  investment we want to return on the money we have in the bank we want a way that makes sense
[3:13:56.240 --> 3:14:01.920]  that's tied into a higher rate as long as they keep rates artificially low they can continue to put
[3:14:01.920 --> 3:14:08.000]  forth these are incredible accounting fraud and it was just an enemy max keiser just to simplify
[3:14:08.000 --> 3:14:15.360]  it for people bloomberg now reports 12.8 trillion has disappeared in six months since october 3rd
[3:14:15.360 --> 3:14:21.440]  into a black hole senators and house members asked the fed chief where's the money he says i won't
[3:14:21.440 --> 3:14:27.600]  tell you meanwhile they're still giving each other record bonuses rome is beginning to burn
[3:14:27.600 --> 3:14:37.280]  630 something thousand people unemployed in march alone accelerating all of this is just
[3:14:37.280 --> 3:14:42.400]  getting crazier and crazier meanwhile the very banking institutions that engage in this ponzi
[3:14:42.400 --> 3:14:48.480]  scheme this counterfeiting fraud as you rightfully put it are running around smiling at the g20
[3:14:48.480 --> 3:14:57.360]  saying that they're saving us i mean where does all this go i mean how bad the black hole
[3:14:57.360 --> 3:15:04.240]  or the shadow banking system is still quite in several magnitudes greater than this 11 to 12
[3:15:04.240 --> 3:15:08.560]  trillion dollars that they've already dumped into the system and we're talking about multiple
[3:15:08.560 --> 3:15:15.760]  hundreds of trillions of dollars and the odd and because that it's a show game so they as you know
[3:15:15.760 --> 3:15:19.360]  Goldman Sachs and jp morgan stopped being investment banks they became commercial banks
[3:15:19.360 --> 3:15:23.920]  that allowed them to be eligible from bailout money from the fed and they bought a dying institution
[3:15:23.920 --> 3:15:28.800]  like maryl lynch was bought by bank of america so they can get money from the fed to bail them out
[3:15:28.800 --> 3:15:34.480]  maryl lynch is still sitting on a huge multi-trillion black hole of debt jp morgan alone has 90
[3:15:34.480 --> 3:15:39.680]  trillion dollars with the derivative contracts and they won't tell you where they are who the
[3:15:39.680 --> 3:15:44.960]  counterparty is you know that that's another phrase you hear all the time all the counterparty are
[3:15:44.960 --> 3:15:49.920]  they at risk are not a risk well the ultimate counterparty is you and me we're the counterparty
[3:15:49.920 --> 3:15:54.080]  and let's be clear let's be clear no counterparty well we're the counterparty ultimately at the
[3:15:54.080 --> 3:16:00.080]  end of the game and how do they do that well the end game is as many people on your show have
[3:16:00.080 --> 3:16:05.840]  pointed out massive money printing hyper you know high inflation hyperinflation so that's
[3:16:05.840 --> 3:16:11.760]  really when the true crisis begins so when obama says that well you know we we're learning our
[3:16:11.760 --> 3:16:16.080]  lessons now and we don't want to repeat this crisis we haven't even started the real crisis yet
[3:16:16.080 --> 3:16:20.560]  the real crisis is when all this money finds its way into the general economy in the form of
[3:16:20.560 --> 3:16:25.600]  hyperinflation the u.s policies right now are the policies not of the 30s that they're trying to avoid
[3:16:25.600 --> 3:16:31.600]  but of weimar republic of the 20s weimar republic to recover from world war one introduced lower
[3:16:31.600 --> 3:16:36.880]  rate high money supply and basically the same policies that the u.s are doing now the result was
[3:16:36.880 --> 3:16:42.240]  hyperinflation of weimar germany history tells us that this is what is going to happen in the u.s
[3:16:42.240 --> 3:16:48.720]  because they're doing the exact same policies now max keiser expanding on that and you've
[3:16:48.720 --> 3:16:52.960]  been making these predictions for years and now unfortunately they're coming through five years
[3:16:52.960 --> 3:16:58.080]  ago you were criticizing the derivative situation and calling it a ponzi scheme now we're at that
[3:16:58.080 --> 3:17:04.960]  point 12.8 trillion they expect us taxpayers to pay back to offshore banks and then in a weird
[3:17:04.960 --> 3:17:11.120]  way the central banks then get paid interest on allowing the government to loan money to the
[3:17:11.120 --> 3:17:16.880]  very banks so they're going to get interest on the money we basically give them and then charge us
[3:17:16.880 --> 3:17:24.240]  interest and the the GDP is 13 trillion of the united states and all these other countries
[3:17:24.240 --> 3:17:30.080]  are are getting close to exceeding their gdps in only six months of looting so a
[3:17:30.080 --> 3:17:36.000]  a how would we ever pay back to the foreign banks if to pay them back for giving them our money
[3:17:36.640 --> 3:17:41.520]  i get your mind around that folks will we be able to ever pay them back with a million new taxes
[3:17:42.080 --> 3:17:48.400]  and then b how bad will the hyperinflation crises get and when is that coming well the
[3:17:48.400 --> 3:17:53.600]  interest that americans on average pay and the percentage of their income that goes to
[3:17:53.600 --> 3:18:00.640]  servicing the debt is um in the um i believe in the 14 to 15 percent i'll double check my figures
[3:18:00.640 --> 3:18:06.800]  i know that it's up quite sharply in less uh in last year a year and a half and the trajectory of
[3:18:06.800 --> 3:18:14.400]  that number is going up quite quickly so when the when the income of you and me and every american
[3:18:14.400 --> 3:18:19.040]  when it gets to the point where you're putting 50 or 60 or 70 of your income to pay just the
[3:18:19.040 --> 3:18:24.800]  interest on your debt then you have what warren buffett himself predicted less than three years
[3:18:24.800 --> 3:18:30.880]  ago warren buffett himself said america is becoming a nation of sharecroppers
[3:18:34.240 --> 3:18:39.360]  and that's what we're talking about we're talking about indentured servitude and it's being engineered
[3:18:39.360 --> 3:18:46.320]  because you know the rich people you got it all the way back to 1649 out you know in england
[3:18:46.320 --> 3:18:51.600]  they're revolted against the divine right of king charles the first was taken off the throne and he
[3:18:51.600 --> 3:18:58.000]  had a parliamentary uh rule established and it was the end of divine right of king uh now we've
[3:18:58.000 --> 3:19:02.960]  got the divine right of hedge funds the hedge funds think that they're god they think tim geyner
[3:19:02.960 --> 3:19:08.720]  thinks he's god and that he farts money and he wants everyone to breathe in his part money
[3:19:08.720 --> 3:19:16.320]  and and think that i can sustain them and let me give you an example of something that's absolutely
[3:19:16.320 --> 3:19:22.800]  uh shocking uh just recently the government went after ubs union bank of switzerland and they said
[3:19:22.800 --> 3:19:28.080]  you know what we found you evading taxes and helping people to to evade taxes we're gonna
[3:19:28.080 --> 3:19:34.720]  find you 750 million dollars at the same time aig through geiger's plan was getting a five
[3:19:34.720 --> 3:19:40.880]  billion dollar cash injection from the u.s taxpayer that went right into ubs's pocket so the penalty
[3:19:40.880 --> 3:19:48.320]  that ubs had to pay for being caught in a uh tax evasion scam was to be gifted from the u.s taxpayer
[3:19:48.320 --> 3:19:53.120]  for the quarter billion dollars let's stay there max i'm gonna repeat that when we come back max
[3:19:53.120 --> 3:19:58.720]  keiser is our guest and we're gonna continue breaking all this down and talk about the
[3:19:58.720 --> 3:20:04.720]  big issue how about we just arrest the bankers this year millions of people will lose electricity

[3:21:06.960 --> 3:21:12.800]  spear we've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that i think all of us
[3:21:12.800 --> 3:21:18.480]  would like to see the obama deception completely destroys the myth that obama is working for the
[3:21:18.480 --> 3:21:24.240]  best interest of the american people while obama's already fudging yeah fudged since day one in this
[3:21:24.240 --> 3:21:30.080]  election if you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing
[3:21:30.080 --> 3:21:38.640]  the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs that's fascist it's not about
[3:21:38.640 --> 3:21:45.520]  left to right it's about a one-world government this film documents who obama works for the lies he

[3:22:27.680 --> 3:22:32.160]  cart the money off to a privately owned bank to have it lent back to us at interest forcing us to
[3:22:32.160 --> 3:22:37.520]  pay taxes to service the debt is this capitalism or was jefferson correct when he said a central
[3:22:37.520 --> 3:22:42.160]  bank issuing a public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing

[3:24:09.520 --> 3:24:14.720]  all right go back to max keiser post of the oracle on bbc max keiser dot com
[3:24:14.720 --> 3:24:22.800]  okay max you got cut off by the break briefly recap for folks listening
[3:24:25.360 --> 3:24:35.760]  the magnitude of what you were just talking about the issue of you've got ubs this big
[3:24:35.760 --> 3:24:40.560]  swiss banks supposedly all these accounts so it gets a 700 something million dollar fine
[3:24:40.560 --> 3:24:48.080]  but then five billion dollars of taxpayer money bailout right so in other words the AIG
[3:24:48.800 --> 3:24:56.560]  which we all know AIG is a huge you know insurance company so-called but it's really
[3:24:57.120 --> 3:25:03.680]  something else the AIG what their main business was creating what the what are called credit
[3:25:03.680 --> 3:25:10.800]  default swaps and well i'll get into that in a second but basically the reason why AIG needed 180
[3:25:10.800 --> 3:25:15.680]  billion dollars with the bailout was because these credit default swaps were proven to be
[3:25:15.680 --> 3:25:21.760]  you know counterfeit and bogus so the government gives them 180 billion dollars now to pay off
[3:25:21.760 --> 3:25:26.160]  their bills to pay off the people that they were involved with their criminal syndicate of credit
[3:25:26.160 --> 3:25:33.600]  default swaps they end up giving um ubs five billion dollars of america's tax money that came
[3:25:33.600 --> 3:25:39.200]  into AIG from the u.s. government to bail them out ostensibly supposedly to help american somehow
[3:25:39.200 --> 3:25:45.120]  but aig turned around and gave five billion to ubs the same week that ubs is paying the u.s.
[3:25:45.120 --> 3:25:50.400]  government a seven or fifteen million dollar fine for being caught aiding tax evaders isn't
[3:25:50.400 --> 3:25:56.480]  a rock up sorry go ahead get net net the ubs gets a four and a quarter billion dollar gift
[3:25:56.480 --> 3:26:02.640]  from the american public for being caught uh aiding people to evade taxes that's that's the
[3:26:03.440 --> 3:26:08.480]  the problem is just not that there's a lack of justice the problem is that there's a psychosis
[3:26:08.480 --> 3:26:13.600]  involved at the highest level to the banking system where you've got like caligula in charge of
[3:26:13.600 --> 3:26:19.040]  these banks they're psychotic thugs that they're they're more the moralities are not they're not
[3:26:19.040 --> 3:26:25.200]  losing morality it's not moral hazard it's moral vacuum they're psychotic they think they can get
[3:26:25.200 --> 3:26:30.080]  away with this it's it's absurd but there are a couple of other examples where these bankers
[3:26:30.080 --> 3:26:35.280]  you see that they've become you know like this caligula capitalist as i call it just recently
[3:26:35.280 --> 3:26:40.560]  you know there's this huge protest in london against the hedge fund industry people are on the street
[3:26:40.560 --> 3:26:44.720]  they're protesting against the hedge funds they're outside the bank of england on thread needle
[3:26:44.720 --> 3:26:51.040]  street in london the bankers are waving uh 10 pound notes out the windows trying to incite
[3:26:51.040 --> 3:26:57.840]  the protesters to commit violence why because they had made bets on online betting exchanges
[3:26:57.840 --> 3:27:02.400]  as to how many protesters would be injured or killed during the uh demonstrations and protest
[3:27:03.200 --> 3:27:06.640]  they really have bankers trying to incite people to get killed because they've got a bet
[3:27:07.280 --> 3:27:12.480]  on the exchange of how many people will get killed do you remember when the pentagon
[3:27:12.480 --> 3:27:16.880]  wanted to create a hedge fund on when the next terror attack was coming to make money off of it
[3:27:17.600 --> 3:27:22.400]  well if you go back to john poindexter he introduced something called a policy analysis market
[3:27:23.200 --> 3:27:27.760]  pam which is based on my technology the virtual specialist technology which you
[3:27:27.760 --> 3:27:32.880]  mentioned at the top of the show i had a patented technology for making a market in events
[3:27:32.880 --> 3:27:37.520]  such as the outline and i my original intent was to do something with hollywood
[3:27:37.520 --> 3:27:41.440]  but it got picked up by the pentagon and they launched this thing or they tried to call the
[3:27:41.440 --> 3:27:46.640]  policy analysis market where people could could buy and sell securities based on terror attacks
[3:27:47.440 --> 3:27:51.760]  and my point at that time was that you're just encouraging terror attacks it's like the people
[3:27:51.760 --> 3:27:56.160]  you know not i don't want to get into the whole nine eleven thing but you know people were making
[3:27:56.160 --> 3:28:01.680]  bets on exploding airplanes in the weeks leading up to nine eleven obviously that's true because the
[3:28:01.680 --> 3:28:08.000]  volume of bets against airlines that they were going to explode was increased 10 to 20 times
[3:28:08.000 --> 3:28:13.680]  so it was no secret that people were making bets against what turned out to be they were making
[3:28:13.680 --> 3:28:20.240]  against bets against themselves but you see this type of moral vacuousness where these bankers are
[3:28:20.240 --> 3:28:25.360]  actually destroying themselves they're destroying the their own economy because it becomes psychotic
[3:28:25.360 --> 3:28:31.440]  the embezzlement and and the and the fraud has run into levels that are not beyond just what
[3:28:31.440 --> 3:28:37.040]  mike milkin did back at jex albertum it's become a whole other magnitude um you have
[3:28:37.040 --> 3:28:42.160]  goldman sacks of course very famously last year sold bonds to municipalities while at the same time
[3:28:42.160 --> 3:28:48.960]  selling short those bonds attacking their customers you have the example of a armor um a company called
[3:28:48.960 --> 3:28:55.600]  armor plating i think the name is they make uh material for soldiers and i were u.s soldiers
[3:28:55.600 --> 3:29:00.240]  and i ran i i rack they couldn't raise money last year because the hedge funds were selling the stock
[3:29:00.240 --> 3:29:05.600]  short they were killing the stock they were selling the shock the stock naked which means
[3:29:05.600 --> 3:29:09.120]  you're selling stock that doesn't exist you're selling counterfeit stock the company couldn't
[3:29:09.120 --> 3:29:14.720]  raise any more money and as a result of course u.s soldiers uh when they were in harm's way
[3:29:14.720 --> 3:29:19.760]  because the hedge funds thought that their profits were more important than the lives of the u.s soldiers
[3:29:19.760 --> 3:29:24.640]  and again it's the divine light of hedge funds it was in the company it's called force protection
[3:29:25.200 --> 3:29:30.160]  hey yeah stay there max geyser stay there this is just amazing and everything he's saying is
[3:29:30.160 --> 3:29:37.280]  documented on record that's how destructive parasitic um carnivorous uh it's not just looting
[3:29:37.280 --> 3:29:42.160]  they're killing the golden goose that lays the eggs and all leaving the united states to live in
[3:29:42.160 --> 3:29:47.840]  armored compounds in the caribbean max geyser dot com's his website my website's info wars dot com

[3:35:53.040 --> 3:35:58.800]  now i'm here okay good my friend um specifically what does that sound like to you to have the
[3:35:58.800 --> 3:36:03.760]  army just announced we're going to run checkpoints for homeland security uh in the middle of tennessee
[3:36:03.760 --> 3:36:10.240]  yeah well you know the problem is that because the government is so bankrupt
[3:36:10.960 --> 3:36:15.040]  that uh more of the ways are going to raise money is by nickle and diming people to death
[3:36:15.760 --> 3:36:21.920]  and so the whole idea of stopping people searching searching people you know you know your car is
[3:36:21.920 --> 3:36:26.560]  parked five inches away from the curb more than it should be uh all the cctv cameras watching
[3:36:26.560 --> 3:36:30.160]  everything this is just a way to raise money basically your nickle and diming people to death
[3:36:30.160 --> 3:36:33.920]  it's just like we're back in the sure would forward forest and you've got people you know
[3:36:33.920 --> 3:36:38.720]  trying to get through the forest and uh they can constantly being held up it's all about the money
[3:36:38.720 --> 3:36:44.080]  out it's not about um protection or security it's just another way to reach into your pocket and
[3:36:44.080 --> 3:36:50.080]  pull out more money uh and these guys who get the contract to do these to do these all these programs
[3:36:50.080 --> 3:36:56.160]  are on the same the same group of people that we're talking about they're part of this this banking
[3:36:56.160 --> 3:37:02.000]  and um government um oligarchy and and and they're really the you know the great i don't
[3:37:02.000 --> 3:37:05.760]  know if you've seen this one alec but you really should there's a great 12 part series on youtube
[3:37:05.760 --> 3:37:12.240]  called um collapse in argentina or argentina collapse and it documents the uh collapse in
[3:37:12.240 --> 3:37:18.640]  argentina and the fusing of the the the um legal system the banks and the political system into one
[3:37:19.440 --> 3:37:24.160]  one you know five fingers of death if you will they just totally reached into the economy and
[3:37:24.160 --> 3:37:28.880]  destroyed it through utter corruption and we're seeing this right now in the u.s. that they're
[3:37:28.880 --> 3:37:37.280]  following that playbook this guy call us manan of argentina um is really a role model going forward
[3:37:37.280 --> 3:37:44.080]  in terms of how to undermine a community but let's get back for a second to um hold on hold on
[3:37:44.080 --> 3:37:48.640]  that's where i wanted to go with this hold on max the imf and world bank documents talk about how
[3:37:48.640 --> 3:37:53.840]  they go pay off governments they have the governments not pay the loans back at loan sharking rates
[3:37:53.840 --> 3:37:57.520]  then the economy implodes then then they declare police state martial law
[3:37:57.520 --> 3:38:02.800]  to further destroy confidence people riot that causes even more confidence to fall
[3:38:02.800 --> 3:38:07.920]  then the offshore banks come in and buy it up for pennies on the dollar and so there's a method
[3:38:07.920 --> 3:38:14.160]  to their madness they brag they love the insane looting and the open stealing because they control
[3:38:14.160 --> 3:38:19.520]  the national security apparatus they're in control they've got the military and the police ready to
[3:38:19.520 --> 3:38:24.960]  follow orders and so the world is their oyster they're just scorched earth using economics as a
[3:38:24.960 --> 3:38:30.720]  weapon to blast the whole world economy so on its ashes they can build this new bank of the world
[3:38:30.720 --> 3:38:35.520]  the only question is that we pay our carbon taxes to the only question is will they get away with it
[3:38:35.520 --> 3:38:43.520]  max keiser i think there's a couple of things that people can do to um to to uh offer some kind
[3:38:43.520 --> 3:38:49.840]  of balance to the situation uh one you know throughout history i think why why shouldn't
[3:38:49.840 --> 3:38:54.560]  there be now a global uh passive resistance movement you know passive resistance movements
[3:38:54.560 --> 3:38:59.120]  in the in the u.s work during the civil rights era and in india under the ghandi era you work
[3:38:59.120 --> 3:39:03.920]  well you know the maybe to fight the global uh you know to feed this global insurrection against
[3:39:03.920 --> 3:39:08.640]  this corporate and banking occupation that we're seeing all over the world there should be a global
[3:39:08.640 --> 3:39:14.800]  program of global civil disobedience for example um one easy thing that people can do
[3:39:14.800 --> 3:39:22.960]  to start to destabilize the oligarchy is is to completely avoid all copyrighted material and
[3:39:22.960 --> 3:39:28.560]  to make your own copyrighted material make your own content that's not to this end i actually
[3:39:28.560 --> 3:39:35.760]  am launching a new website this week it's called pirate my film dot com pirate that's what i do
[3:39:35.760 --> 3:39:42.000]  that all along max keiser i want to a bbc news reporter host his own show max keiser dot com
[3:39:42.000 --> 3:39:46.960]  invented stock market system stay there uh we've got the state rep and so just stay there for a
[3:39:46.960 --> 3:39:51.840]  moment i apologize i want to get him on because this is breaking news uh he's representative uh
[3:39:51.840 --> 3:39:56.960]  john shaw just joins us for a few minutes representative from tennessee district 80 sir
[3:39:56.960 --> 3:40:02.000]  thank you for coming on with us sure you're welcome thank you for having me alex you bet now we
[3:40:02.000 --> 3:40:07.120]  played the clip earlier of you on a local news station talking about army checkpoints uh the
[3:40:07.120 --> 3:40:11.760]  governor found out thanks to you and others and canceled it can you just in a nutshell
[3:40:11.760 --> 3:40:19.200]  tell us exactly uh specifically what was going on oh yes i can the first of all i you know i
[3:40:19.200 --> 3:40:23.840]  have got a check now i don't have concrete facts but i don't think the military has
[3:40:23.840 --> 3:40:30.320]  first of all in the jurisdiction to be checking seat belts uh number one but number two because
[3:40:30.320 --> 3:40:37.760]  of the economy in our area uh we just got news a couple of weeks ago that uh the state may be
[3:40:37.760 --> 3:40:44.480]  closing down one of our private uh correctional facilities which is going to eliminate about
[3:40:44.480 --> 3:40:51.760]  350 jobs if that happen unless they can rebit these beds to some of the state now we don't
[3:40:51.760 --> 3:40:57.360]  know right now where we are that's still a proposal it has not yet been decided upon
[3:40:57.360 --> 3:41:02.960]  and therefore that is one of the reasons why i said that the governor does not need this extra
[3:41:02.960 --> 3:41:09.360]  headache in that area right now and then i think thirdly when you look at the fact of a military
[3:41:09.360 --> 3:41:14.400]  unit being out uh your your daughter my wife or someone driving through a roadblock with all of
[3:41:14.400 --> 3:41:18.880]  these local officials the army and everybody out there i think it's just going to scare people to
[3:41:18.880 --> 3:41:26.640]  death i think our local and state officials have the staff when needed to check seat belts uh to
[3:41:26.640 --> 3:41:31.280]  do a seat belt check without the army getting involved and uh i just don't think it's a good idea
[3:41:32.400 --> 3:41:37.040]  well obviously sir uh i don't know if you've heard but yes it still violates possecom and
[3:41:37.040 --> 3:41:42.560]  taught us they haven't completely removed that 1878 law we know in mexico and communist china
[3:41:42.560 --> 3:41:47.920]  they have trips on the streets this is a sign of a banana republic of a third world police state
[3:41:47.920 --> 3:41:54.480]  so that we don't want that but the larger issue here is that they've announced homeland security
[3:41:54.480 --> 3:42:00.400]  wants to put 20 000 regular army troops to to patrol america the naval war college the army
[3:42:00.400 --> 3:42:05.920]  war colleges said their new job will be engaging us a combat with the american people to stop an
[3:42:05.920 --> 3:42:11.600]  insurrection against the banks uh so a are you aware of that b can you tell us specifically
[3:42:11.600 --> 3:42:17.760]  what units how we you know why the army was going to be out running checkpoints well and i'm not
[3:42:17.760 --> 3:42:23.840]  aware of that and let me just tell you i found this out late on friday evening myself when some
[3:42:23.840 --> 3:42:29.840]  calls starting started to come into my local office i am in this nashfield at state capitol
[3:42:29.840 --> 3:42:36.960]  monday through thursday's um give a take noon two ish three o'clock in afternoon time but i'm
[3:42:36.960 --> 3:42:42.880]  in my district on fridays well i got this news late on friday and when i got the news i immediately
[3:42:42.880 --> 3:42:48.800]  jumped on it to try to call some local authorities that i knew first to see what was going on and
[3:42:48.800 --> 3:42:54.560]  when i made the call i had found out or i found out at that point in time that the governor had
[3:42:54.560 --> 3:43:00.720]  already made the decision to cancel this and which i was very proud of that but i am not aware of
[3:43:00.720 --> 3:43:06.800]  homeland security doing this i did hear that they would be involved in this roadblock issue on last
[3:43:06.800 --> 3:43:13.440]  friday but i am not aware of the other part of the question that you ask okay specifically though
[3:43:13.440 --> 3:43:19.360]  when you talk to the local authorities whose idea where did it come from that regular army
[3:43:19.360 --> 3:43:22.960]  is going to be out running checkpoints i mean a checkpoint is unconstitutional
[3:43:22.960 --> 3:43:28.240]  if you don't have warrants and it's random for the police to do that now the army i mean again
[3:43:28.240 --> 3:43:32.720]  the service is suddenly happening everywhere this is part of a larger plan so we as detectives are
[3:43:32.720 --> 3:43:38.080]  asking you uh specific you any other little tidbits you've got about who was behind this
[3:43:38.080 --> 3:43:44.000]  well and i don't know alex i can't answer that question other than the fact it was going to
[3:43:44.000 --> 3:43:50.480]  take place in a little area of my district in a town called whitepool tennessee which would
[3:43:50.480 --> 3:43:57.840]  lead me to believe or to assume that the chief of police there was the one who uh orchestrated
[3:43:57.840 --> 3:44:04.000]  this idea now to say that is a fact i don't know because i have not spoken to him uh
[3:44:04.000 --> 3:44:09.520]  it directly i've spoken to some other officials uh was the state involved because we're almost out
[3:44:09.520 --> 3:44:14.800]  of town and i'm sorry to interrupt was the state involved uh not to my knowledge at all okay so
[3:44:14.800 --> 3:44:19.760]  the governor had to say no so this is what we always see the army then probably approached
[3:44:19.760 --> 3:44:25.680]  some locals as part of their covert acclimation program and uh state representative uh johnny
[3:44:25.680 --> 3:44:30.960]  shall we appreciate you uh speaking out against this we appreciate the governor saying no to this
[3:44:30.960 --> 3:44:35.600]  can you just in closing speak to why you were concerned about it and against it well again
[3:44:35.600 --> 3:44:40.880]  i was concerned because i think in this in this economic climate or in this climate that we are
[3:44:40.880 --> 3:44:47.280]  in with all of the terrorist attacks etc so forth and so on can you imagine your wife your daughter
[3:44:47.280 --> 3:44:54.880]  my wife or daughter even son driving up to a checkpoint with homeland security the military
[3:44:54.880 --> 3:45:00.320]  police the state police if they were involved and then of course all of your local authorities
[3:45:00.320 --> 3:45:04.800]  is going to make someone think something bad has happened in the community and i just don't think
[3:45:04.800 --> 3:45:10.160]  this is a good idea i think it's a it would have been a scare tactic that would have been hard for
[3:45:10.160 --> 3:45:15.840]  some of our citizens to get over maybe some of our senior citizens and i'm totally against this kind
[3:45:15.840 --> 3:45:21.200]  of a tactic and i'm going to do my best as a state representative to see that this does not happen
[3:45:21.200 --> 3:45:28.480]  again in my district and hopefully nowhere in the state of tennessee okay mr shaw representative
[3:45:28.480 --> 3:45:34.960]  shaw thank you for the time thank you for having me take care okay max keiser i apologize uh for
[3:45:34.960 --> 3:45:39.200]  making you wait five minutes uh when we invited you on here but this is breaking and i wanted
[3:45:39.200 --> 3:45:45.680]  to just get that on record again max it isn't just about raising money suddenly all over the marines
[3:45:45.680 --> 3:45:51.120]  are at dwi checkpoints the armies at mass shootings suddenly they're putting liaison officers
[3:45:51.120 --> 3:45:55.920]  in all the major police departments in the intelligence bureau this is slow motion uh
[3:45:55.920 --> 3:46:01.200]  martial law yeah well when you have an economy like america which is 70 percent consumption
[3:46:01.200 --> 3:46:05.680]  and something like uh 10 to 15 percent military you know you got to give them something to do
[3:46:06.400 --> 3:46:12.240]  you know this is just the business of america is is the military and consumption so you've got huge
[3:46:12.240 --> 3:46:16.720]  health problems with overconsumption huge economic problems and you've got your military sitting in
[3:46:16.720 --> 3:46:22.480]  your backyard because the economy it needs to be rearchitected so to to reflect something else
[3:46:22.480 --> 3:46:29.040]  this current economic architecture of america consumption and militarism does not it is can
[3:46:29.040 --> 3:46:33.440]  be changed to reflect something else it does not reflect any existential threat there's
[3:46:33.440 --> 3:46:37.840]  absolutely no reason for the american economy to be consumption and militarism it's just a
[3:46:37.840 --> 3:46:43.120]  choice made by those who sell consumer products and military products to create a country that
[3:46:43.120 --> 3:46:50.320]  buys military military purchases and consumer products instead max instead max you know loop
[3:46:50.320 --> 3:46:54.560]  for those people but it doesn't have to be that way there's nothing in the world and nobody
[3:46:54.560 --> 3:47:00.320]  you know the fact is america's five percent of world population the gdp is shrinking rapidly
[3:47:00.320 --> 3:47:04.880]  it has a very high opinion of itself uh you know who really cares about it anymore i mean
[3:47:04.880 --> 3:47:09.280]  it the other economies are growing faster they're more interesting they're more dynamic in asia in
[3:47:09.280 --> 3:47:14.640]  the mid east in europe you know america thinks you know it's becoming kind of a forgotten country
[3:47:14.640 --> 3:47:19.120]  at this point because it just doesn't do that much anymore you know the the the athletes are all
[3:47:19.120 --> 3:47:23.600]  on steroids the olympics are fixed the banking systems are fraud who really thinks about it
[3:47:23.600 --> 3:47:28.560]  if you leave america nobody talks about america anymore sure barack obama is a very photogenic
[3:47:28.560 --> 3:47:33.840]  guy and he's great in europe and they plot him but by this time next week he will be in you
[3:47:33.840 --> 3:47:40.000]  know forgotten and people can be focusing on jobs quality of life and issues that are important
[3:47:40.000 --> 3:47:47.040]  within the economies here in europe that do not uh feed into consumerism and radical militarization
[3:47:47.040 --> 3:47:51.360]  that's not what the economy is based in max geiser i interrupted you earlier i wanted you
[3:47:51.360 --> 3:47:57.200]  to finish up with your new website dealing with uh changing the paradigm yeah changing paradigm is
[3:47:57.200 --> 3:48:04.080]  exactly right the site is called pirate my film dot com it gives filmmakers a way to finance their
[3:48:04.080 --> 3:48:11.680]  films by pre-selling what i call gold copies to people who are then entitled to a percentage
[3:48:11.680 --> 3:48:18.000]  of any ad revenues that might be generated once the film is released to the pirate network so i
[3:48:18.000 --> 3:48:23.600]  say instead of fighting the pirates work with the pirates because the copyright so-called pirates
[3:48:24.240 --> 3:48:28.800]  they're being vilified unnecessarily all they're doing is stretching the limits of technology
[3:48:28.800 --> 3:48:35.040]  and challenging unjust copyright laws and they're being again caught up in the military in a u.s
[3:48:35.040 --> 3:48:40.640]  and it's killing intellectual property in the u.s it's stifling creativity in the u.s to have things
[3:48:40.640 --> 3:48:47.200]  on copyright law for 20 30 40 50 lifetime plus 70 years is like having an intellectual lobotomy
[3:48:47.200 --> 3:48:50.960]  and that's part of the reason america can't think it's way out of these problems because all the
[3:48:50.960 --> 3:48:55.840]  good ideas are locked up on corporate balance sheet but say this site pirate my film dot com
[3:48:55.840 --> 3:49:01.360]  it gives filmmakers and creatives a chance to raise money for projects by pre-selling future ad
[3:49:01.360 --> 3:49:07.360]  revenue and it's all based on my some of my previous designs and some of my previous websites
[3:49:07.360 --> 3:49:12.080]  it is all i have up now right now is a splash page but i'm gonna start to introduce more
[3:49:12.080 --> 3:49:17.280]  functionality in the very next few days all right max keiser i got a lot of final questions i want
[3:49:17.280 --> 3:49:23.360]  to get to with you uh you know i talked about how bad will it get but let's try to cover that but
[3:49:23.360 --> 3:49:30.800]  first barack obama i see him just as a diversion and as a distraction uh that the establishment
[3:49:30.800 --> 3:49:36.320]  is using all the very same power structure outside of even his control just moves forward
[3:49:36.320 --> 3:49:40.880]  with their agenda your take on that well i've been on your show before i like i make two i
[3:49:40.880 --> 3:49:45.680]  said two statements that i want to revisit right now you're leading up to the barack obama election
[3:49:45.680 --> 3:49:49.840]  i said you know i'm gonna give him the benefit of doubt i'm not gonna really come out and be a
[3:49:49.840 --> 3:49:53.840]  critical barack obama even though the people in his cabinet look the exact same people as the bush
[3:49:53.840 --> 3:49:58.720]  cabinet but give him the benefit of doubt now i have seen what i've seen and it looks like
[3:49:58.720 --> 3:50:04.160]  he's totally under in the pocket of wall street and these guys and i'm absolutely
[3:50:04.160 --> 3:50:09.440]  flabbergasted because it doesn't appear as always really making any kind of moves to extricate
[3:50:09.440 --> 3:50:14.480]  himself from the iron grip of these financial oligarchs but it's kind of saddens me uh the other
[3:50:14.480 --> 3:50:17.520]  thing i mentioned on your show a couple of months ago was that there would be a run on the comex and
[3:50:17.520 --> 3:50:24.080]  the gold market and back in december that did not happen but we did just get news that deuterbank
[3:50:24.080 --> 3:50:28.000]  was involved in a massive manipulation on the comex in the past couple of weeks so there's
[3:50:28.000 --> 3:50:33.120]  still a lot of um fun and games going on in the comex the gold futures markets in new york there
[3:50:33.120 --> 3:50:39.120]  wasn't a run as i predicted back in december but there is a lot of um a lot of calduggery going
[3:50:39.120 --> 3:50:43.920]  on in that market well to be fair you said you thought it might happen but they might be able
[3:50:43.920 --> 3:50:48.560]  to manipulate themselves out of it i mean the imf just announced they're gonna sell their gold
[3:50:48.560 --> 3:50:53.520]  to try to drive it down again so it's like a beach ball they're trying to hold under i got a key

[3:55:54.000 --> 3:55:59.280]  keiser up before you on the show max specifically you got linked up on drudge and made national news
[3:55:59.280 --> 3:56:05.200]  in the u.s when you made the point on international media that uh you know global currency is
[3:56:05.200 --> 3:56:10.160]  you that the establishment some of them want the bankers want a new level of ponzi scheme
[3:56:10.160 --> 3:56:12.880]  you made the comment that the united states would not put up with that
[3:56:14.320 --> 3:56:20.080]  yeah exactly in other words um the u.s dollar the world reserve currency the imf is mostly made up
[3:56:20.080 --> 3:56:26.320]  of dollars in the u.s influence those the world bank the uh the fact that the u.s has a world
[3:56:26.320 --> 3:56:31.760]  reserve currency gives it an incredible advantage in global commerce because it can effectively
[3:56:31.760 --> 3:56:36.400]  buy things on credit and then when they have to pay out the credit they just issue more currency
[3:56:37.120 --> 3:56:41.120]  and that's the advantage of having a work reserve currency all other countries in the world
[3:56:41.120 --> 3:56:47.120]  for example if they want to buy oil they first have to buy dollars because oil is traded exclusively
[3:56:47.120 --> 3:56:53.040]  in dollars gold is extreme is traded in dollars and commodities are traded in dollars so if any
[3:56:53.040 --> 3:56:57.280]  other country like japan wants to buy oil they first have to buy dollars and that's what gives
[3:56:57.280 --> 3:57:01.920]  incredible support to the dollar and the u.s gets a commission on every single dollar that you know
[3:57:01.920 --> 3:57:05.440]  that's a huge business for these bankers is the commission on dealing in dollars so they don't
[3:57:05.440 --> 3:57:08.960]  want to get rid of that business they don't want to share that business anyone else they don't want
[3:57:08.960 --> 3:57:14.720]  any other competing currencies and they'll go and and you know when iraq was going to start trading
[3:57:14.720 --> 3:57:20.800]  oil in euros that's when you the u.s went in shocking off when when when iran start talking
[3:57:20.800 --> 3:57:27.040]  about trading oil and gas in euros oh oh we're going to start saber rattling uh against iran
[3:57:27.040 --> 3:57:31.680]  you know and in china now saying well oh we're going to start trading in something maybe other
[3:57:31.680 --> 3:57:35.280]  than dollars and we're going to do all these bilateral deals billions tens of billions of
[3:57:35.280 --> 3:57:40.400]  dollars of bilateral deals and in africa using other currencies other than the dollar and the
[3:57:40.400 --> 3:57:45.680]  question as well as the u.s going to go in there and do some kind of military action in beijing
[3:57:45.680 --> 3:57:52.160]  like they've done in other countries and although it may sound at first blushed a bit extreme
[3:57:52.160 --> 3:57:58.720]  you think about a previous empire uh which was england when their counter party china
[3:57:58.720 --> 3:58:04.240]  was not buying their goods the english went in with their gunboat and started something called
[3:58:04.240 --> 3:58:09.600]  the opium war they got china hooked up on opium addicted to opium as a way to defend the british

[4:01:41.840 --> 4:01:47.200]  us from paris okay max continue breaking down you got into the opium wars recap that explain
[4:01:47.200 --> 4:01:51.840]  how important a world reserve currency is and how the international bankers based in the us
[4:01:51.840 --> 4:01:57.600]  in england have been using this power to abuse everybody take over the world people are sick of
[4:01:57.600 --> 4:02:02.720]  it but well there's also a fisher though with inside the bankers some of them have been saying
[4:02:02.720 --> 4:02:07.600]  they want a new global currency or one stacked on top of the dollar because they've already
[4:02:07.600 --> 4:02:13.760]  whored out the dollar so bad so navigating this where do you see this going yeah well first of
[4:02:13.760 --> 4:02:19.440]  all you've been covering this idea of a global currency for quite some time and you've had a
[4:02:19.440 --> 4:02:24.320]  lot of people on your show talking about it and people have kind of pecked at it and looked at it
[4:02:24.320 --> 4:02:30.640]  and try to come up with the story and you've kept you've kept digging at it and um to your credit
[4:02:30.640 --> 4:02:36.000]  because everybody else in the financial press has really been skirting and dodging this issue of a
[4:02:36.000 --> 4:02:40.800]  global currency and uh... well lo and behold you know the alex jones show is pretty much correct on
[4:02:40.800 --> 4:02:46.800]  this one because we do now have a global currency and it's called the credit default swap the credit
[4:02:46.800 --> 4:02:52.960]  default swap is a unit of fraud and it is the basic unit of the global banking system today
[4:02:52.960 --> 4:02:58.160]  it's a multi hundred trillion dollar market it's issued by investment banks around the world and
[4:02:58.160 --> 4:03:04.480]  it's used to transfer risk which is the ultimately collateralizing the global economy's risk not
[4:03:04.480 --> 4:03:10.160]  reward or not substance or not anything tangible like gold bullion but calculations which determine
[4:03:10.720 --> 4:03:16.000]  risk in various outcomes and events that's the global currency today and the credit default swap
[4:03:16.000 --> 4:03:20.000]  is the unit of that currency it is a global currency it's happening right now and when we
[4:03:20.000 --> 4:03:24.720]  talk about re capitalizing the imf and bringing in special drawing rights and putting in a trillion
[4:03:24.720 --> 4:03:29.840]  dollars worth of additional funding what ultimately what that means is just rejiggering the books on
[4:03:29.840 --> 4:03:34.080]  all these big banks balance sheets in terms of their credit default swap positions and how to
[4:03:34.080 --> 4:03:38.800]  take care of these positions and how to manage these positions and uh we've gone from a fractional
[4:03:38.800 --> 4:03:43.920]  reserve banking system alex to a negative reserve banking system it's completely topsy turvy and
[4:03:43.920 --> 4:03:51.680]  then inside out there is absolutely no there there if you go back to 2004 i remember greenspan
[4:03:51.680 --> 4:03:58.000]  convinced the sec to allow to allow banks to increase their debt to capital ratios from 12 to 1
[4:03:58.000 --> 4:04:04.800]  to 30 to 1 which is a huge jump in one single stroke of the pen and that does not include
[4:04:04.800 --> 4:04:08.320]  the shadow banking system where all the credit default swaps are trading if you include the
[4:04:08.320 --> 4:04:14.160]  credit default swaps into this law in 2004 from greenspan you're talking about a global
[4:04:14.160 --> 4:04:21.760]  banking reserve system that's based on a 1 to infinity it's just completely it's a fictitious
[4:04:21.760 --> 4:04:26.720]  it's what thomas jefferson called fictitious currency it's just it's just it's just it's
[4:04:26.720 --> 4:04:32.240]  a notational value in a book there's absolutely nothing behind it and ultimately what this means
[4:04:32.240 --> 4:04:36.800]  is that there's going to be no more competition and when you have no more competition and when
[4:04:36.800 --> 4:04:42.160]  you have price fixing for the interest rates that is bought that are behind these fake currencies
[4:04:42.160 --> 4:04:46.640]  you end up with a command and control economy and you end up right back to where you know the
[4:04:46.640 --> 4:04:54.480]  soviets were in the 1950s no competition command and control price fixing and and indebtedness
[4:04:54.480 --> 4:05:00.160]  and and an indentured servitude and this is all what unfortunately the outcome of this is that
[4:05:00.160 --> 4:05:06.960]  competition is that the phrase is understood in america is going to die well uh one of the
[4:05:06.960 --> 4:05:12.640]  the british members of the european parliament this hannon gentlemen he brought up the point
[4:05:12.640 --> 4:05:17.680]  to gordon brown a few weeks ago he said you can repeat in that wooden aporagic like somebody
[4:05:17.680 --> 4:05:22.960]  from the soviet era that everything's fine as you spend you know hundreds of billions more a month
[4:05:22.960 --> 4:05:29.120]  into the maw of the private banks but reality you know is going to basically overthrow you
[4:05:29.120 --> 4:05:33.840]  and so where do you see this going i mean the bankers are acting like they're the saviors
[4:05:33.840 --> 4:05:40.320]  but meanwhile they're feeding the entire real economy or what's left of it into their derivatives
[4:05:40.320 --> 4:05:45.040]  to make sure they end up getting their money out claiming they need trillions more to start
[4:05:45.040 --> 4:05:50.640]  the economy going while they use the money to actually hoard everything yeah that's basically
[4:05:50.640 --> 4:05:58.000]  true i mean i take the long view which is that if you go back to the 1350 period you know during
[4:05:58.000 --> 4:06:02.800]  the feudalism the only thing that gave rise to the middle class the only thing that gave rise to
[4:06:02.800 --> 4:06:09.360]  the ability of non nobility to negotiate a wage was the black plague in europe which wiped out
[4:06:09.360 --> 4:06:13.440]  virtually half the population it was after the wipeout of half the population in europe
[4:06:13.440 --> 4:06:17.920]  that had the rise of the middle class because all these lords needed now people to work on their
[4:06:17.920 --> 4:06:22.400]  estate and they were willing to pay them a wage that was the beginning of what we call the middle
[4:06:22.400 --> 4:06:27.520]  classes this has been going on but the stop at the nobility wanted that was happy about this
[4:06:27.520 --> 4:06:33.120]  they they're back and forth the aristocrats and the and the nobility want everything back they
[4:06:33.120 --> 4:06:38.080]  don't want a middle class they don't want people with the social mobility they don't want democracy
[4:06:38.080 --> 4:06:43.440]  it's inconvenient for them you know in 1649 as i mentioned earlier there was this idea well we
[4:06:43.440 --> 4:06:50.800]  got rid of the divine right of kings which led then to 1694 the aristocracy came back with let's
[4:06:50.800 --> 4:06:57.280]  introduce the bank of england which is put in place by the aristocrats in england to reestablish
[4:06:57.280 --> 4:07:02.480]  the place of the aristocrats after they had lost the battle of six of the losing the divine right
[4:07:02.480 --> 4:07:08.000]  of kings in the 1649 then you had the of course you had the french revolution the american revolution
[4:07:08.000 --> 4:07:12.720]  and you had the history since then we're at a period in time now where you've got this idea with a
[4:07:12.720 --> 4:07:17.360]  divine right of hedge funds they believe that they're above there they're literally god's gift to
[4:07:17.360 --> 4:07:22.720]  planet earth they they're completely above any any law and they're just their their value of money
[4:07:22.720 --> 4:07:27.440]  is what they say it is you know like we hear stories about the old medieval days how many
[4:07:27.440 --> 4:07:31.440]  how many angels could dance on the head of a pen with an argument by priests now we've got tim
[4:07:31.440 --> 4:07:34.800]  geiger in the hedge fund thing well how many credit default swaps can dance on the head of this
[4:07:34.800 --> 4:07:38.800]  point with collateralized debt obligation it's all nonsense they're just talking out of their
[4:07:38.800 --> 4:07:45.440]  butthole that there's no value there at all they're just creating a total fictitious uh what i call
[4:07:45.440 --> 4:07:51.920]  a financial hologram it's just it's just flickering images in the context of a somebody's ledger but
[4:07:51.920 --> 4:07:56.720]  there's no there's nothing there unemployment skyrocketing america there's no benefits left
[4:07:56.720 --> 4:08:02.720]  in america people don't have any net worth their houses have been disirated what where's the value
[4:08:02.720 --> 4:08:08.160]  what where's where's people's wealth what happened to it it's been stolen that's what happened to it
[4:08:10.240 --> 4:08:15.680]  absolutely um max keiser specifically we're getting into obama
[4:08:15.680 --> 4:08:23.040]  we can see how this ends the bankers are going to carry out their agenda they're going to act like
[4:08:23.040 --> 4:08:28.320]  he was in power and and try to fool the public into believing that this puppet will you know
[4:08:28.320 --> 4:08:34.400]  engineered all this meanwhile the ruling class move on putting a new puppet in who they will then
[4:08:34.400 --> 4:08:38.480]  you know allow to take all the blame can you speak to that specifically reaching out to
[4:08:38.480 --> 4:08:44.000]  obama supporters who are supporting whatever the banks do right now thinking that well you know
[4:08:44.000 --> 4:08:49.200]  that obama is doing it to save them can you explain to them this betrayal or how do you see that
[4:08:49.200 --> 4:08:56.000]  unfolding i guess i'm lucky because i live in france i live in europe and i can act i'm a little
[4:08:56.000 --> 4:09:02.080]  bit one but two steps removed from the obama phenomenon you know but you see him on tv for
[4:09:02.080 --> 4:09:09.440]  five minutes and he's an extraordinarily gifted guy in terms of his charisma and um so it's it's
[4:09:09.440 --> 4:09:15.760]  difficult to peel yourself away from that but if you just look at the numbers and what's going on
[4:09:15.760 --> 4:09:20.560]  as i mentioned with that case with the ubs and all these banks and and and the wholesale
[4:09:20.560 --> 4:09:27.840]  offering that's going on you got to say you know that guy might be a beautiful politician but
[4:09:27.840 --> 4:09:33.840]  i'm starving to death you know i got it i'm living in a tent i can't uh you know i mean i this isn't
[4:09:33.840 --> 4:09:39.840]  a film this is my life and and they got it you know understand that there's the real that there's
[4:09:39.840 --> 4:09:46.960]  there's a real uh consequences to to this to this financial oligarchy that's been left allowed to
[4:09:46.960 --> 4:09:52.720]  run amok and i i still think that some kind of civil disobedience has got to be the way to go
[4:09:52.720 --> 4:09:58.400]  i mean obviously the black community america figured out the civil disobedience was the way to
[4:09:59.280 --> 4:10:03.600]  engineer some rights for themselves and it worked out pretty well they've got a black president
[4:10:03.600 --> 4:10:10.800]  fantastic and now what about community america as a whole doing some kind of collective civil
[4:10:10.800 --> 4:10:16.640]  disobedience to put pressure on this banking oligarchy to shift the balance of wealth back
[4:10:16.640 --> 4:10:21.440]  you know how all that money that was given to the banks they could have very easily just wiped
[4:10:21.440 --> 4:10:26.080]  every credit card debit balance clean in america it would have cost less money people would have
[4:10:26.080 --> 4:10:30.640]  started spending immediately and the economy would already be growing what would have if it was
[4:10:30.640 --> 4:10:37.520]  growing then the banks to deal with the growth would have to raise interest rates and they hate
[4:10:37.520 --> 4:10:41.280]  that they hate raising interest rates because you can't steal money when interest rates are going
[4:10:41.280 --> 4:10:45.600]  higher you can only the best way to steal money is when interest rates are going lower they could
[4:10:45.600 --> 4:10:50.480]  have totally wiped away every visa and mastercard debit in america would have cost less than they
[4:10:50.480 --> 4:10:55.360]  spent so far and people would be down and all spending right now but then the economy would
[4:10:55.360 --> 4:11:00.960]  be growing and they would have to raise interest rates and and that's it that's not banks don't
[4:11:00.960 --> 4:11:06.720]  like that the neil feudal banking class doesn't want higher interest rates so they want people
[4:11:06.720 --> 4:11:11.440]  making a return on their savings max keiser any way you cut it then and you write the everything
[4:11:11.440 --> 4:11:16.480]  post you tried to be supporter of obama i mean bush was terrible and we would have thought he
[4:11:17.040 --> 4:11:21.360]  you know should have helped i mean bottom line you're saying clearly after watching him several
[4:11:21.360 --> 4:11:26.160]  months in power and who he put in power and what he's doing who does obama work for where is he
[4:11:26.160 --> 4:11:33.920]  taking the country the numbers speak for themselves i i don't see as long as um summers and geithner
[4:11:33.920 --> 4:11:41.360]  are in the jobs that they're currently in there's there's going to be no change no progress and and
[4:11:41.360 --> 4:11:46.400]  when the president obama talks about we know we're we're getting a handle on this crisis and we're
[4:11:46.400 --> 4:11:51.600]  going to make sure we don't even repeat it again because the crisis hasn't even really started yet
[4:11:51.600 --> 4:11:56.960]  because the real crisis begins when all these bailouts turn out to turn out to be that they
[4:11:56.960 --> 4:12:01.680]  didn't have they don't work you know even today the banks reported that we need another round of
[4:12:01.680 --> 4:12:06.160]  bailouts because they're all the bailout so far didn't work all the bank stocks were down again
[4:12:07.040 --> 4:12:13.280]  and at the other side of this is going to be a tsunami of inflation and that's the crisis
[4:12:13.280 --> 4:12:19.600]  this is just a warm-up this is just a warm-up well i mean absolutely you're right about that
[4:12:19.600 --> 4:12:24.320]  look the establishment isn't stupid you talk about this imperial hubris you know the bankers
[4:12:24.320 --> 4:12:29.520]  engaging all this looting and corruption they know that's why they're militarizing police that's why
[4:12:29.520 --> 4:12:33.440]  they're saying we're going to use 20 000 armed troops on the streets of america that's why the
[4:12:33.440 --> 4:12:38.480]  army war colleges are getting ready to engage the people but that's even more crazy the bankers think
[4:12:38.480 --> 4:12:43.120]  they can just just like argentina like you said talk more about that totally destroy everything
[4:12:43.120 --> 4:12:50.160]  financially and then just use militarized police to suppress us i mean this is hellish but i guess
[4:12:50.160 --> 4:12:55.520]  they don't care everything's ruined as long as they're the top dogs sitting on top the pile of
[4:12:55.520 --> 4:13:01.120]  shit you know for lack of a better term so so so break that down along the lines of the engineered
[4:13:01.120 --> 4:13:06.560]  collapse of argentina and where you see this going here yeah the argentina example is fantastic
[4:13:06.560 --> 4:13:11.120]  and as i said before it's called argentina collapse the 12-part youtube series of the
[4:13:11.120 --> 4:13:19.360]  so it's about 120 minutes or so it's a document document you know a document film and it lays out
[4:13:19.360 --> 4:13:24.240]  the timeline so it's remarkable about that film is you can pretty well figure out where america
[4:13:24.240 --> 4:13:30.960]  is on the timeline and right now america seems to be on the around that 2000 2001 period when the
[4:13:30.960 --> 4:13:38.480]  banks and the politicians and the legal system basically just pulls up the drawbridge and says
[4:13:38.480 --> 4:13:44.800]  you're on your own and the people around the street banging pots they close the banks they close
[4:13:44.800 --> 4:13:49.440]  access to the banks and they're just starving in the street and the guys are in the castle they
[4:13:49.440 --> 4:13:54.400]  pulled up the drawbridge and they're partying and that's that's kind of like the timeline we're on
[4:13:54.400 --> 4:14:00.560]  and who who was orchestrating the the i the argentina nightmare oh who's the imf who's in charge
[4:14:00.560 --> 4:14:06.800]  of bailing out the world now oh it's the imf it's the same group of people that they're going to do
[4:14:06.800 --> 4:14:13.200]  the same austerity measures on the u.s. they're treating america like you like the city bank
[4:14:13.200 --> 4:14:18.400]  treated latin america in the 1980s who do they think they are but but more than that i want you
[4:14:18.400 --> 4:14:24.080]  speak to this max they're they're going to raise the drawbridge up let us rot for six months to
[4:14:24.080 --> 4:14:30.320]  a year to teach us and then they'll let a little bit of loans back in and they'll pose as the savior
[4:14:30.320 --> 4:14:35.760]  doling out more fiat currency backed with by taxpayers and the middle class is going to be
[4:14:35.760 --> 4:14:41.200]  gone yeah exactly well they'll dole it out again interest rates are the fulcrum upon which all these
[4:14:41.200 --> 4:14:46.240]  things are balanced so if you're a friend of the the people of on the other side of that drawbridge
[4:14:46.240 --> 4:14:51.280]  you get a low rate like for example the hedge fund community right now geithner said the hedge fund
[4:14:51.280 --> 4:14:56.320]  community we want you to buy some of our toxic debts and but and to do we're going to lend you
[4:14:56.320 --> 4:15:01.600]  money at the virtually zero interest rate and if it doesn't work out you don't lose money we're
[4:15:01.600 --> 4:15:07.520]  going to bail you out again see that's a nice deal where do i get that deal you're going to lend
[4:15:07.520 --> 4:15:12.640]  me money at zero percent interest to buy what you call the toxic debt if i lose any money
[4:15:12.640 --> 4:15:17.040]  you're going to make me all again that that's a deal the government's offering the hedge fund
[4:15:17.040 --> 4:15:22.640]  community well that's like me going into los vegas and pulling the slot machine and anytime it
[4:15:22.640 --> 4:15:29.040]  doesn't come up a winner the casino pays out triple what would you say to the police and military
[4:15:29.040 --> 4:15:33.600]  listening i mean they're really have the same interest of the american people they're all having
[4:15:33.600 --> 4:15:40.880]  their future destroyed as well comment on that and then secondarily what about having state
[4:15:40.880 --> 4:15:45.840]  grand juries federal grand juries go after more of these made-offs more of these bankers that have
[4:15:45.840 --> 4:15:51.680]  committed all these crimes and start bringing these arrogant bastards to justice then we can you
[4:15:51.680 --> 4:15:56.320]  know i get rid of their system and bring back liberty and freedom and transparency and the
[4:15:56.320 --> 4:16:01.520]  rule of law i mean it's either us or them if we keep letting them grandstand as the saviors
[4:16:01.520 --> 4:16:08.880]  for the crisis they created there's no end in sight well you know the police and the military
[4:16:08.880 --> 4:16:14.640]  they're they're in a horrible position because first of all you know as a society we need police
[4:16:14.640 --> 4:16:21.120]  we need military and um so they are just stuck in a horrible position if you use the argentina
[4:16:21.120 --> 4:16:27.680]  timeline what happens is eventually at the end they side with the people remember in the chavez coup
[4:16:27.680 --> 4:16:33.520]  that was proven to be a you know a plot of the u.s the military eventually sided with the people
[4:16:33.520 --> 4:16:37.520]  so they're they're the last ones to flip unfortunately because they're in the worst position
[4:16:38.160 --> 4:16:43.360]  um but they're they eventually they do flip but it's by then the situation is quite bad
[4:16:43.360 --> 4:16:49.280]  so how do you go after these people you know if you go back to the 1980s with michael milkin
[4:16:49.280 --> 4:16:54.240]  and the treks of bernum lambert which was at that time the biggest fraud in wall street history
[4:16:54.240 --> 4:16:58.800]  ultimately where i think it was really juliani who was a prosecutor at the time in new york
[4:16:58.800 --> 4:17:03.920]  they had to go and actually they had to use a rico anti-racket hearing and that's the only way
[4:17:03.920 --> 4:17:07.760]  you're going to get at these guys because the rating agencies like moody's and fmp who gave these
[4:17:07.760 --> 4:17:14.160]  bars triple a rating fraudulently the investment banks that recommended them and the um everyone
[4:17:14.160 --> 4:17:19.920]  involved in this racket in this conspiracy has to be prosecuted simultaneously under rico because
[4:17:19.920 --> 4:17:24.160]  if you go after one at a time that they just move the game to a new venue they move the game to
[4:17:24.160 --> 4:17:28.480]  new security now it's a new credit default swab now it's a synthetic credit default swab now it's
[4:17:28.480 --> 4:17:34.000]  an inverted yield credit default out of the money put spread they just keep making up new securities
[4:17:34.000 --> 4:17:39.440]  as they go along and it's impossible to track them down so what juliani figured out was rico
[4:17:39.440 --> 4:17:44.240]  we're going to go after them as a racket and they took down drachyl they took down iven boski
[4:17:44.240 --> 4:17:48.480]  and they took down michael milkin to take down geitner and these guys they've got to go after
[4:17:48.480 --> 4:17:55.280]  them using rico but now it's a thousand times worse now they premeditatedly thought about this
[4:17:55.280 --> 4:18:01.120]  they're leveraging it to the global level and uh they're saying we're in a separate bank of the
[4:18:01.120 --> 4:18:06.080]  world that you pay your taxes to i mean i guess they've got to go for broke because if they don't
[4:18:06.080 --> 4:18:10.320]  go for broke and get the power get the tyranny i mean they what i'm saying is they've got to have
[4:18:10.320 --> 4:18:17.040]  the tyranny in place just to protect themselves from all their previous crimes again the argentina
[4:18:17.040 --> 4:18:21.760]  timeline and methodology is it's a great film if you haven't seen it or you haven't seen it recently
[4:18:21.760 --> 4:18:28.240]  take it out again the way that basically um what happens is the legal system the the judges and the
[4:18:28.240 --> 4:18:35.200]  judiciary it becomes it gets into play and they say that the highest courts in the land start to
[4:18:35.200 --> 4:18:40.160]  rewrite laws and i would imagine that as the banking crisis gets worse and worse we're gonna
[4:18:40.160 --> 4:18:50.160]  see a lot new some new laws um which are going to be sweeping remember that when the the lawsuits
[4:18:50.160 --> 4:18:54.960]  against the telecom companies for illegally spying on people they just basically swept all those
[4:18:55.520 --> 4:19:00.960]  suits under the rug in one in one draft of the pen so ultimately when it becomes clear that
[4:19:00.960 --> 4:19:06.160]  the banking system is sitting on hundreds of trillions of dollars worth of of a fraudulent
[4:19:06.160 --> 4:19:11.440]  counterfeit paper um then we're going to start we're going to see they're going to say okay
[4:19:11.440 --> 4:19:17.360]  we're going to bring in this new global banking system the us dollar is now gone it's being replaced
[4:19:17.360 --> 4:19:24.160]  with another unit of currency that is tied into these other units of currency and um it probably
[4:19:24.160 --> 4:19:28.800]  it'll be devalued quite sharply of course and that'll be the hyperinflation so anything that
[4:19:28.800 --> 4:19:33.680]  cost you five dollars today will cost you 10 or 15 dollars in one day it'll happen in one day
[4:19:33.680 --> 4:19:38.320]  and we saw this in the 30s price of gold and the dollar was a devaluation and in one day
[4:19:38.880 --> 4:19:44.320]  those two things the price changed dramatically in one day so you'll see this happening and they're
[4:19:44.320 --> 4:19:48.160]  going to loot what's left of the middle class they're already admitting it changing the whole
[4:19:48.160 --> 4:19:54.480]  tax code getting rid of mortgage exemptions education exemptions uh so obama lied about
[4:19:54.480 --> 4:20:00.720]  that saying nobody over 125 000 a year or couples of 250 uh there's new york states pass something
[4:20:00.720 --> 4:20:06.080]  like 88 new taxes i mean my god these people are getting ready to completely gang rape us
[4:20:07.200 --> 4:20:11.760]  well i got we're saying the middle class is an inconvenience an inconvenience for the people
[4:20:11.760 --> 4:20:18.160]  who want more of of the you know like nantucket you know if somebody in the middle class builds
[4:20:18.160 --> 4:20:21.600]  a house in front of your house and you're like carl icon and you're out in nantucket and some
[4:20:21.600 --> 4:20:26.000]  i revist build the house in front of yours that's quite upsetting so you'll do whatever you need to
[4:20:26.000 --> 4:20:31.760]  do to uh get rid of this middle class this thing called the middle class it's in my way and this
[4:20:31.760 --> 4:20:37.360]  is the mentality and the u.s was formed as an escape from the bank of england benjamin franklin
[4:20:37.360 --> 4:20:41.520]  said one of the reasons that we started the america to begin with was to escape the uh
[4:20:41.520 --> 4:20:46.800]  the the pernicious clause of the bank of england and the usury that came with it well that lasted
[4:20:46.800 --> 4:20:50.160]  for a while then the u.s the the same people who brought the bank of england started the
[4:20:50.160 --> 4:20:56.400]  federal reserve bank in 1913 and that was uh you know a horrible event in terms of america's
[4:20:56.400 --> 4:21:03.760]  quest to be independent of a user of uh central banking system uh that that is uh as you would
[4:21:03.760 --> 4:21:10.560]  say a parasite and it hasn't it hasn't contributed to to growth whatsoever so but but as far as
[4:21:10.560 --> 4:21:15.920]  you know point the finger to bomba you know the thing is ultimately the people in the united
[4:21:15.920 --> 4:21:20.960]  states are going to have to figure out you know one of the one of the horrible tragedies of all
[4:21:20.960 --> 4:21:26.800]  these security checkpoints and all these police and the militarization is that neighbor begins to
[4:21:26.800 --> 4:21:32.080]  distrust neighbor and people are really paranoid and people are really afraid of each other and
[4:21:32.080 --> 4:21:37.040]  that's exactly places in the hands of the people who are confiscating the wealth you know any solution
[4:21:37.040 --> 4:21:42.320]  is going to require cooperation and community cooperation and and and that's that's going
[4:21:42.320 --> 4:21:47.200]  to happen that's why in the in the constitution in the bill right there's a right to assemble
[4:21:47.200 --> 4:21:51.280]  well the right to even the right to assemble is being destroyed because you've got checkpoints
[4:21:51.280 --> 4:21:56.560]  you've got militarization you've got cctv cameras you've got spies everywhere we can't even we can't
[4:21:56.560 --> 4:22:00.480]  even stumble we can't even have a meeting to decide what we want to do and we look at alex
[4:22:00.480 --> 4:22:07.040]  joneshow and alex jones is uh you know trying to get as much information as you possibly can
[4:22:07.040 --> 4:22:12.400]  within an information universe that's for the most part is completely controlled by a corporate
[4:22:12.400 --> 4:22:17.840]  agenda yeah now max i'm really getting demonized by the left and the right they are really coming
[4:22:17.840 --> 4:22:23.360]  after me they got co until pro low level high level people it's starting to get scary i mean i know
[4:22:23.360 --> 4:22:28.320]  i signed on to this and i'm going in through and beyond just like you are but the good news is as
[4:22:28.320 --> 4:22:33.120]  things get worse and worse more people are listening and joining us and standing beside us and i hope
[4:22:33.120 --> 4:22:37.360]  folks will visit max keiser dot com tell folks about the oracle and how they can watch that on
[4:22:37.360 --> 4:22:44.320]  the bbc right well the oracle on bbc world news it's uh season number one is done finished we're
[4:22:44.320 --> 4:22:50.400]  working on season number two but we're working to move the show uh over toward the terrestrial
[4:22:50.400 --> 4:22:56.240]  channels in the uk because nobody in the uk can see the show because nobody in the uk gets satellite
[4:22:56.240 --> 4:23:01.600]  tv they get bbc one two three and four but they don't get bbc world news so we're trying to move
[4:23:01.600 --> 4:23:06.960]  the show from bbc world news to bbc four or bbc three uh so that people in the uk can actually
[4:23:06.960 --> 4:23:12.160]  see the show and i'm getting emails every day and to that end i get emails every day people
[4:23:12.160 --> 4:23:18.160]  saying get alex jones in the show got by far the most requested guest from emails i get every day
[4:23:18.160 --> 4:23:24.880]  is for alex jones so when we move this show to a terrestrial station or we get a deal in the us
[4:23:24.880 --> 4:23:30.960]  on a cable network either showtime or hbo then um you know for we'll have the alex jones i think
[4:23:30.960 --> 4:23:35.200]  the alex jones message for part of the reason you're having difficulty right now is because
[4:23:35.200 --> 4:23:40.960]  you're regional you're in the us you got to go global because your message should go global
[4:23:40.960 --> 4:23:46.560]  it's because this is a global this is a global problem there's no i know when i do australian
[4:23:46.560 --> 4:23:53.440]  tv or radio or russian or south african or english every caller calls in a ring and they're
[4:23:53.440 --> 4:23:57.760]  really awake but folks are also awake here it's just the government the media are really starting
[4:23:57.760 --> 4:24:02.320]  to come after us and a lot of really spooky stuff is going on but the government's trying
[4:24:02.320 --> 4:24:05.920]  to tell americans that everyone's out to get them there's an existential threat there's a boogie
[4:24:05.920 --> 4:24:11.200]  man under every coffee table that's just not true you know it's all if your economy is based on
[4:24:11.200 --> 4:24:15.840]  overconsumption and militarization you're going to get people to eat donuts and buy guns well folks
