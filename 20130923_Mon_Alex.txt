[00:55.240 --> 01:03.440]  Al Qaeda forces and we have Dr. Jerome Corsi joining us at the bottom of the
[01:03.440 --> 01:08.000]  hour before he even wrote an article this morning I knew to call him to set
[01:08.000 --> 01:12.040]  him up for the show last night because I knew what his analysis on this would be
[01:12.040 --> 01:16.760]  because he's been following it Obama through different family members
[01:16.760 --> 01:22.200]  cousins and half brothers is running the jihadi invasion and takeover of North
[01:22.200 --> 01:26.320]  Africa in the Middle East out of Kenya this came out a month ago in our
[01:26.320 --> 01:30.520]  broadcast world that daily's been covering it and we now are getting a
[01:30.520 --> 01:36.120]  very clear picture of exactly the plan they've got separately and this is up on
[01:36.120 --> 01:42.720]  info wars dot com right now two stories Saudi Arabia threatens to end career of
[01:42.720 --> 01:49.680]  AP reporter over chemical weapons story remember it was that report that we then
[01:49.680 --> 01:56.480]  magnified that went international days before the strike that was happened on
[01:56.480 --> 02:00.760]  that Saturday a few weeks ago that was the straw that broke the camels back and
[02:00.760 --> 02:05.200]  made them back off from not doing the bombardment to back the Al Qaeda forces
[02:05.200 --> 02:09.680]  attacking Syria and the and the report was is that
[02:09.680 --> 02:15.360]  Bandar bin Sultan Saudi Prince former ambassador of the US head of Saudi
[02:15.360 --> 02:21.560]  Arabian intelligence the Intel was and this is now come out in the Russian news
[02:21.560 --> 02:25.840]  as well that he was behind the chemical weapons transfers now you can imagine
[02:25.840 --> 02:30.720]  he's pretty mad we've had reporters before in DC filming and numbers and a
[02:30.720 --> 02:35.040]  limo will drive by and people will stop and jump out and run over and say this
[02:35.040 --> 02:39.240]  is Saudi Arabian vehicle you don't aim cameras that us and the police will
[02:39.240 --> 02:43.880]  follow their orders and take your footage I've never seen our country roll
[02:43.880 --> 02:47.240]  over more than they do to the Saudi Arabian royalty that just throws their
[02:47.240 --> 02:52.200]  billions around everywhere and this is the new article also up on prison
[02:52.200 --> 02:56.680]  planet dot com and info wars dot com CIA linked vet who fought with Al Qaeda
[02:56.680 --> 03:04.600]  released from jail on a $100 fine I'm gonna explain who Al Qaeda really is and
[03:04.600 --> 03:08.160]  what Saudi Arabia is up to because they are people like to say it's Israel I'm
[03:08.160 --> 03:11.200]  not defending what Israel is doing I've been critical of it but really it's
[03:11.200 --> 03:16.720]  Saudi Arabia that's got the Shiite Sunni thing going and and they are
[03:16.720 --> 03:21.960]  quarterbacking the deal they're quarterbacking it they've got the forces
[03:21.960 --> 03:29.160]  just like the quarterback 9-11 or the globalist and you keep seeing whether
[03:29.160 --> 03:32.880]  it's amber lion of CNN with Qatar and all these other governments paying off
[03:32.880 --> 03:39.440]  CNN so her reports don't air I'm telling you folks I'm telling you they've had
[03:39.440 --> 03:43.280]  local Muslim groups that are moderate pointing out what Saudi Arabia is up to
[03:43.280 --> 03:49.840]  and people are found dead floating the river down on Lake Austin Ladybird Lake
[03:49.840 --> 03:53.840]  is the new name of it and one of my reporters I'm not gonna say their name
[03:53.840 --> 03:59.520]  but it's one of our long-term reporters was out with his girlfriend and
[03:59.520 --> 04:03.400]  obviously didn't have his phone or we have video with this because folks like
[04:03.400 --> 04:06.280]  to leave their phones behind and go out and have a fun time without worrying
[04:06.280 --> 04:09.960]  about it and these guys get out of their car sharp dress Saudi Arabian
[04:09.960 --> 04:13.760]  intelligence type this happened yesterday walk right over to him and keep

[04:26.880 --> 04:31.520]  family and they just kept saying that and by the way they followed them in
[04:31.520 --> 04:35.160]  there when they pulled up to park at the park to take their dogs out and that's
[04:35.160 --> 04:39.600]  the exact type of stuff that goes on they are very very upset with us all

[08:43.200 --> 08:48.640]  willing and we do need you to pray for this operation now more than ever Dr.
[08:48.640 --> 08:55.880]  Jerome Corsi is reporting the headline did Americans help plot Kenyan terror
[08:55.880 --> 09:01.040]  attack al Qaeda affiliate claiming responsibility actively recruits in the
[09:01.040 --> 09:07.720]  US and is backed by Obama I would add Bob Fletcher involved exposing Iran
[09:07.720 --> 09:11.400]  Contra is going to pop in about 30 minutes with his take on the world and
[09:11.400 --> 09:15.680]  then Debra Traveras that we were going to have on Friday we got a scheduling
[09:15.680 --> 09:21.600]  issue with time zones she'll be joining us coming up in the in the third hour
[09:21.600 --> 09:28.000]  today let me just stop right here because I got hit like a ton of bricks this
[09:28.000 --> 09:34.640]  morning driving into work with exactly how incredibly serious the global
[09:34.640 --> 09:41.000]  situation is and how info wars dot com and prison planet dot com and my news
[09:41.000 --> 09:45.720]  organization and what we do is right dead center in the middle of world events
[09:45.720 --> 09:54.840]  now I don't say that from a position of oh I'm on a power trip and oh look how
[09:54.840 --> 09:59.680]  important we are it's the opposite I don't like it but it's my duty it is
[09:59.680 --> 10:06.920]  incredibly dangerous and it just really clicks in to my mind a whole bunch of
[10:06.920 --> 10:12.680]  facts a whole bunch of pieces and wasn't fear so much as it was bracing
[10:12.680 --> 10:19.280]  concern almost like you're about to go over a wall in World War one at Gallipoli
[10:19.280 --> 10:24.320]  you know in Turkey and there's machine gun nest on the other side about to open
[10:24.320 --> 10:28.480]  fire on you and you're going over the wall and you're you're going to face it
[10:28.480 --> 10:33.440]  and it was the realization that we're all going over the wall together as well
[10:33.440 --> 10:40.120]  and that the world is aligning for history to be made on so many fronts and
[10:40.120 --> 10:44.560]  it's going to be the good and the bad and the people in the middle that are
[10:44.560 --> 10:50.960]  going to decide the future of humanity right now but it was clicking Dan
[10:50.960 --> 10:55.440]  Badandi our reporter on the East Coast has now uploaded us the videos he went
[10:55.440 --> 11:01.640]  and investigated the Navy Yard shooting and has eye witnesses of incredibly over
[11:01.640 --> 11:06.120]  the top hardcore stuff
[11:08.080 --> 11:12.840]  and so we've got that information that I've got simmering and getting ready to
[11:12.840 --> 11:20.480]  break you've got Dan Badandi at three separate press conferences bringing up
[11:20.480 --> 11:26.360]  false flag the drill and photos of the security contractors out there there
[11:26.360 --> 11:29.800]  was a drill that's been confirmed they don't want to discuss they sent secret
[11:29.800 --> 11:33.240]  service over the president was nowhere around they had him there to threaten
[11:33.240 --> 11:37.480]  him at the second and third press conferences and get in his face this
[11:37.480 --> 11:42.360]  was on video in national news threatening him grabbing on him and he
[11:42.360 --> 11:48.960]  stood his ground and then later he was threatening a lot of other stuff then I
[11:48.960 --> 11:55.360]  realized we broke the AP reporter who was reporting for a news site out of
[11:55.360 --> 12:01.600]  Minnesota they reported for BBC you name it but reporting for the news site
[12:01.600 --> 12:10.600]  mint press out of Minnesota that Saudi Arabian intelligence and this was
[12:10.600 --> 12:13.840]  witnessed by other reporters as well that also reported it that Saudi
[12:13.840 --> 12:18.600]  Arabian intelligence gave the chemical weapons to the rebels and that they
[12:18.600 --> 12:23.280]  launched them to obviously then be able to blame a side so that they could get
[12:23.280 --> 12:27.560]  the red line crossed so a NATO bombardment could start and I realized
[12:27.560 --> 12:32.240]  it was info wars calm and prison planet calm because I don't like to give
[12:32.240 --> 12:36.360]  ourselves credit it's everybody together this is not the kind of credit you want
[12:36.360 --> 12:45.480]  by the way this like being a lead bomber flying in over you know a major
[12:45.480 --> 12:48.600]  industrial site in World War two you're gonna be getting shot at ladies and
[12:48.600 --> 12:53.800]  gentlemen you're who they all train their sights on and it and it clicked we
[12:53.800 --> 13:00.080]  already knew this but it all clicked wait a minute we're the ones that took
[13:00.080 --> 13:05.760]  that and magnified that and that probably stopped in fact it's credited by
[13:05.760 --> 13:10.840]  many sites and sources and governments at derailing the imminent attack and the
[13:10.840 --> 13:16.440]  chairman of the Joint Chiefs going to Obama's house the White House at
[13:16.440 --> 13:21.760]  midnight saying don't do this the entire military's against you doing this and
[13:21.760 --> 13:25.840]  everybody knows we're funding Al Qaeda and this is a PR disaster you got to go
[13:25.840 --> 13:32.440]  to Congress all of that was clicking and the fact that we are magnifying Dr.
[13:32.440 --> 13:36.160]  Jerome Corsi and others who were saying get ready for a staged Islamic terror
[13:36.160 --> 13:41.480]  in Kenya that's where Obama is running the operations out of and then the head
[13:41.480 --> 13:46.240]  of Al Qaeda came out two weeks ago and said attack shopping malls attack
[13:46.240 --> 13:49.840]  people on the street all over the world attack Christians it's happening in
[13:49.840 --> 13:54.800]  Kenya Pakistan now wait for it near up the US then Obama will use that as a
[13:54.800 --> 13:59.240]  diversion and reason to take our liberties we broke all that and I just
[13:59.240 --> 14:05.320]  had the realization we actually get what's going on and we haven't been
[14:05.320 --> 14:08.360]  arrogant about the fact that we've got our ear to the ground and really know
[14:08.360 --> 14:12.840]  what we're talking about and have specialized in it for myself for 18
[14:12.840 --> 14:17.960]  years tracking how this stuff really works and it's really creepy and and
[14:17.960 --> 14:25.800]  scary and by scary scary just to have the knowledge and scary to be so alone
[14:25.800 --> 14:30.200]  that other people don't understand the paradigm like we do and that we've got
[14:30.200 --> 14:34.240]  all these governments and all these institutions and all these systems
[14:34.240 --> 14:42.640]  listening to us and then we've got Saudi Arabian intelligence undoubtedly is
[14:42.640 --> 14:50.000]  is is hopping mad that they're the ones quarterbacking the forces out of out of
[14:50.000 --> 14:56.680]  Turkey and Israel and Jordan and in our and Iraq it's Saudi Arabia funding on
[14:56.680 --> 14:59.880]  record I mean that's what Kerry said we already knew that the entire
[14:59.880 --> 15:09.440]  operation basically against against Syria and they see it when you're against
[15:09.440 --> 15:14.200]  an illegal war funding al-Qaeda to attack and take that country over they see
[15:14.200 --> 15:19.280]  it as you're at war with them when you're not going along with their
[15:19.280 --> 15:25.920]  program and that's why one of my reporters he's a little has a little
[15:25.920 --> 15:28.880]  consternation about me putting his name in it because it's just so weird but
[15:28.880 --> 15:32.840]  he's happy to actually go public he probably will but he didn't have his
[15:32.840 --> 15:38.400]  phone with him his girlfriend didn't and they go out to walk their dogs at the
[15:38.400 --> 15:42.360]  lake and the and these guys follow him in get out you know fancy dressed Arab
[15:42.360 --> 15:47.200]  guys sounds just like Saudi Arabian intelligence and start saying nice
[15:47.200 --> 15:51.080]  family nice dog you'll just videotaping them for like five minutes looking at
[15:51.080 --> 15:55.560]  them obvious threat like right out of a movie with the mafia and then he was so
[15:55.560 --> 15:59.640]  mad that he didn't have you know a way to tape but he did get their license plate
[15:59.640 --> 16:03.680]  number and then they left when they left and this this happened to me years ago
[16:03.680 --> 16:08.640]  with US military type guys you know it would like in a target parking lot or
[16:08.640 --> 16:12.000]  the TV station parking lot would come over and basically tell me don't plan
[16:12.000 --> 16:16.040]  anything violent we're gonna we'll take you out our teams watching you and it
[16:16.040 --> 16:19.240]  was the same and I was like what are you talking about were you guys told I'm
[16:19.240 --> 16:22.240]  planning something violent cuz whoever told you that's a liar and if you're
[16:22.240 --> 16:27.880]  trying to intimidate me I'm not gonna get into what I told him you can imagine
[16:27.880 --> 16:32.320]  the point is is that then it was all we're just friends now the military
[16:32.320 --> 16:36.400]  listens they're awake they know what's going on that there are listeners that
[16:36.400 --> 16:41.040]  doesn't happen anymore but the point I had an FBI agent show up one time I let
[16:41.040 --> 16:45.600]  him hear many times and Secret Service and ATF and state police and you know
[16:45.600 --> 16:49.880]  ascending provocateurs and to try to give us documents that are illegal to
[16:49.880 --> 16:54.640]  have and just it's ongoing we don't really talk a lot about this folks but
[16:54.640 --> 16:59.200]  I mean I live in the middle of a spy movie but I instantly when he identified
[16:59.200 --> 17:02.000]  what they were driving how they acted because we've run into him before
[17:02.000 --> 17:05.960]  Saudi Arabian intelligence because they're the ones that are authorized
[17:05.960 --> 17:11.800]  to operate here domestically and or they may have been Arab Arab because
[17:11.800 --> 17:15.680]  Rayleigh's but they from when I heard it was from the way it was described Saudi
[17:15.680 --> 17:19.840]  Arabian type and they're the ones most angry right now threatening this AP
[17:19.840 --> 17:23.760]  reporter this has now been confirmed it's they've gone public telling him you
[17:23.760 --> 17:28.880]  better retract this or your career is over and more pretty much a threat other
[17:28.880 --> 17:32.720]  reporters I mean do you think they're happy that we exposed that they're
[17:32.720 --> 17:37.360]  given chemical weapons the evidence is overwhelming to Al Qaeda forces do you
[17:37.360 --> 17:41.640]  think they're happy that that now everybody from Rand Paul to Ron Paul to

[27:32.480 --> 27:37.440]  them they blew their heads off shot over 250 people this is the type of
[27:37.440 --> 27:41.480]  garbage we're talking about and Dr. Jerome Corsi is going to be joining us
[27:41.480 --> 27:46.160]  to break this down and clearly the White House is involved running the radical
[27:46.160 --> 27:54.320]  groups out of Kenya all over the Saudi Arabia Dr. Corsi broke all this a month
[27:54.320 --> 28:01.360]  ago on this very broad gift how they're running the entire jihad operation out

[28:07.640 --> 28:12.840]  this is a plan carving up the world and they think Americans are going to roll
[28:12.840 --> 28:16.640]  over and they hate the fact that we still got guns all these foreign
[28:16.640 --> 28:20.720]  governments the UN all these mafias they hate the fact that we're not scared
[28:20.720 --> 28:23.440]  and we're all armed to the teeth and we're getting more guns and we know how
[28:23.440 --> 28:26.600]  to use them better than they do they absolutely hate the fact we're now
[28:26.600 --> 28:31.760]  identifying them this is a war ladies and gentlemen and no more does it creep
[28:31.760 --> 28:35.280]  around in the shadows it all comes out in the open now it all comes out in the
[28:35.280 --> 28:38.880]  open all these special interest from Goldman Sachs to JP Morgan to the

[29:13.320 --> 29:15.960]  and that's why we had so much freedom compared to other countries and we
[29:15.960 --> 29:19.200]  weren't perfect by a long shot but they spent all day in the corporate control
[29:19.200 --> 29:23.600]  press demonizing this republic going after it telling you how bad it is
[29:23.600 --> 29:27.720]  because it's a threat to them when it's 10 times better than all these other
[29:27.720 --> 29:32.040]  countries we were once exceptional now we're unexceptional or we're
[29:32.040 --> 29:35.680]  exceptional in tyranny because we've been occupied we've been captured by

[33:43.240 --> 33:47.720]  them as proxy armies to overthrow areas in the Middle East North Africa
[33:47.720 --> 33:54.840]  Central Asia and into Eastern Europe the corporations are using them as a new
[33:54.840 --> 34:01.360]  form of colonialism to create a new caliphate and I wasn't sophisticated
[34:01.360 --> 34:04.160]  enough in the last decade when people said this I thought oh that's just
[34:04.160 --> 34:07.920]  propaganda for all these wars I knew the government was working with al-qaeda
[34:07.920 --> 34:11.240]  letting them attack us they could take liberties but now I realize reading the
[34:11.240 --> 34:16.280]  project for new american century again that I didn't understand it when they
[34:16.280 --> 34:20.540]  say clash of civilizations they're going to divide the world up with the
[34:20.540 --> 34:28.840]  jihadist Wahhabist Muslims out of Saudi Arabia Qatar and other countries
[34:28.840 --> 34:33.320]  they're going to bring down every other nation over there that's why mubarak
[34:33.320 --> 34:37.360]  had to be sacrificed they tried to turn Egypt over to them Saudi Arabia acts
[34:37.360 --> 34:40.680]  like they're there for their brothers they're going to give money to prop up
[34:40.680 --> 34:45.040]  Egypt it's the opposite you've got Israel thinking they're taking out their
[34:45.040 --> 34:51.960]  enemy Iran by going after Syria they're involved you've got Turkey you've got
[34:51.960 --> 34:56.720]  NATO you've got France this is pure evil and you've got the defense contractors
[34:56.720 --> 35:00.720]  and companies that just want more war zones to dump more money into no bid
[35:00.720 --> 35:04.400]  contracts you've got a whole bunch of special interests that want this except
[35:04.400 --> 35:08.880]  the British governments could see where this goes in the future and losing all
[35:08.880 --> 35:12.440]  credibility losing all moral high ground and the fact that the public has
[35:12.440 --> 35:17.120]  woken up that Al Qaeda is now almost completely run by the West and funded
[35:17.120 --> 35:24.640]  and controlled all this is now coming out and the joint chiefs and the chairman
[35:24.640 --> 35:29.120]  who was known for being pretty hawkish went to Obama and said you got to stop
[35:29.120 --> 35:33.800]  the military is going to mutiny over the fact that we're funding Al Qaeda and
[35:33.800 --> 35:36.480]  we're training them at these bases in Jordan that's been going on for two and
[35:36.480 --> 35:39.760]  a half years so Obama had to come out and give a speech to hide in plain view
[35:39.760 --> 35:43.320]  what was already happening hoping the military once it was public would think
[35:43.320 --> 35:47.280]  well it must be okay because they're publicly admitting it see just like
[35:47.280 --> 35:53.000]  they inoculated publicly saying tortures good you understand that just so
[35:53.000 --> 35:55.840]  people think well it's okay we're ordered to torture they're admitting it on
[35:55.840 --> 36:01.240]  TV this is a tactic now dr. Jerome course he was with us last month from
[36:01.240 --> 36:04.480]  worldnetdaily.com bestselling author former consultant at the State
[36:04.480 --> 36:09.400]  Department Harvard graduate in economics political science you name it very
[36:09.400 --> 36:14.360]  smart guy has his ear to the ground inside the DC power structure he knows
[36:14.360 --> 36:17.880]  what he's talking about I want to get his take to concur if I'm wrong or
[36:17.880 --> 36:21.640]  right or to add to this but I knew last night to calling to get him on briefly
[36:21.640 --> 36:25.720]  today because I instantly saw what this was he said a month ago they're running
[36:25.720 --> 36:30.720]  the Muslim Brotherhood and Al Qaeda groups money laundering out of Kenya the
[36:30.720 --> 36:34.160]  documents were coming out in the Arab press they were translating it at
[36:34.160 --> 36:40.600]  worldnetdaily over we were covering it at info wars as well info wars.com WND.com
[36:40.600 --> 36:46.400]  had all the news and sure enough here is his article from yesterday did
[36:46.400 --> 36:50.240]  Americans help plot Kenyan terror attack Al Qaeda affiliate claiming
[36:50.240 --> 36:54.440]  responsibility actively recruits in the US here's our info wars.com article
[36:54.440 --> 36:58.600]  Saudi Arabia threatens the in career of AP reporter over chemical weapons story
[36:58.600 --> 37:02.120]  and there's all these other reporters saying the same thing and the videos
[37:02.120 --> 37:06.600]  being uploaded by the jihadis and the UN finding that it was the jihadis none
[37:06.600 --> 37:11.880]  of that's in the news right now because the head of Al Qaeda two weeks ago
[37:11.880 --> 37:17.040]  called for soft targets to be hit Christian targets Pakistan Kenya places
[37:17.040 --> 37:20.720]  they can hit they're hitting doesn't mean our government's giving them the
[37:20.720 --> 37:24.520]  orders our government has criminals in it that help fund these groups the
[37:24.520 --> 37:30.160]  jihadis on the ground are real folks but now it becomes a political diversion to
[37:30.160 --> 37:34.120]  quantify this this is so big then one of my top reporters is out with his
[37:34.120 --> 37:39.960]  girlfriend and he's been here years and nothing like this ever happened to him
[37:39.960 --> 37:44.320]  and I've had this happening before in DC Saudi Arabian type intelligence folks
[37:44.320 --> 37:48.760]  in the fancy car pull up in the sports jackets walk over with cameras going nice
[37:48.760 --> 37:54.840]  family his family wasn't with him this is girlfriend he's divorced and and you
[37:54.840 --> 37:59.400]  know has kids as girlfriend for many years video tape and I'm going nice
[37:59.400 --> 38:02.800]  family nice dog obviously threatening for five minutes he hadn't brought his
[38:02.800 --> 38:06.040]  phone with it was they were just down at the park with the dogs this is the kind
[38:06.040 --> 38:09.120]  of stuff like right out of a movie and and we've talked to reporters who don't
[38:09.120 --> 38:12.320]  want to go on air we have some here in this new article today who have gone on
[38:12.320 --> 38:15.560]  record a lot of people are getting threatened we have sources in Syria
[38:15.560 --> 38:19.120]  Christians that won't come on now that have been on the news because they've
[38:19.120 --> 38:22.200]  been death-threaded they said by Saudi Arabian intelligence that's
[38:22.200 --> 38:26.160]  quarterbacking the whole deal now I want to see from Dr. Corsi if I'm correct
[38:26.160 --> 38:30.360]  from my analysis Saudi Arabia's quarterbacking this looks to me like
[38:30.360 --> 38:35.680]  perfect timing to turn the jihadi's loose in that mall now the New York PD saying
[38:35.680 --> 38:41.040]  give up your rights checkpoints because of the mall attack Obama is blaming the
[38:41.040 --> 38:45.960]  ford hood shooting on American gun owners saying that's not terror the two
[38:45.960 --> 38:50.640]  years it turned out for two years they were in intelligence briefings the CIA
[38:50.640 --> 38:56.080]  was tracking Major Hassan getting orders from Al Qaeda and the same head of
[38:56.080 --> 39:00.040]  Al Qaeda that set attack the US two weeks ago or Christian targets so it
[39:00.040 --> 39:05.400]  appears Obama is activating his jihad not just in the Middle East or North
[39:05.400 --> 39:10.680]  Africa but getting ready to activate it in in other areas and again they know
[39:10.680 --> 39:15.440]  the public can't differentiate Sunni from Shiite and so in this war they're
[39:15.440 --> 39:19.960]  going to use this to bring in domestic martial law that's my big concern and
[39:19.960 --> 39:26.760]  now we know the larger story Dr. Jerome Corsi best-selling author joins us
[39:26.760 --> 39:29.320]  we're gonna be back up for a full hour soon on his new book that's already
[39:29.320 --> 39:33.720]  becoming a best-seller who really killed Kennedy a very powerful book I've
[39:33.720 --> 39:37.600]  already read half of it just got it last week doc you heard me go over those
[39:37.600 --> 39:43.560]  points and and then I realized other than us an info wars you at WorldNet
[39:43.560 --> 39:48.240]  Daily and others I know have been the ones breaking this and it's
[39:48.240 --> 39:54.680]  fantastical as it appears is it as bad as it looks to me sir I think you're I
[39:54.680 --> 39:59.520]  think you're correct I guess I think you're right on I mean let's go let's
[39:59.520 --> 40:05.640]  just dissect a little bit of this Kenya violence first of all you gotta understand
[40:05.640 --> 40:13.200]  that the Somalis which remember the Somalis are the warlord kind of unlawful
[40:13.200 --> 40:18.840]  unruled country that we invaded when the Black Hawk down down during the
[40:18.840 --> 40:25.440]  Clinton that's that's Somalia Somalia has been having Muslim terrorists pour
[40:25.440 --> 40:34.080]  into Kenya since since Obama took office I mean I reported going back into
[40:34.080 --> 40:39.680]  2007 when Obama was running for office you remember that Odinga who is the
[40:39.680 --> 40:45.640]  tribal clansmen and of course we've got tribal relations in in Kenya that are
[40:45.640 --> 40:54.240]  very important the tribal kids Odinga signed an agreement with the Muslims in
[40:54.240 --> 41:01.920]  in Kenya the national Muslim leader forum Nam left in 2007 that if Odinga
[41:01.920 --> 41:06.720]  who was then running for president were supported by the Muslims when Odinga
[41:06.720 --> 41:11.600]  got in he would do everything he could including revising the Constitution to
[41:11.600 --> 41:16.080]  favor Islam and Obama advised him as your book broke down with the emails on
[41:16.080 --> 41:19.960]  how to stage riots they give him a prime ministership instead of the
[41:19.960 --> 41:23.680]  presidency when he lost so bottom line I should have quantified this this is
[41:23.680 --> 41:28.200]  basically Obama behind jihadis connected to this attack this is this is
[41:28.200 --> 41:33.680]  unbelievable and it was Obama's plan that when Odinga lost the presidential
[41:33.680 --> 41:40.320]  election at the end of 2007 these riots which were you know against the
[41:40.320 --> 41:46.600]  majority tribe in the cuckoo you in in Kenya which Odinga on behalf of the
[41:46.600 --> 41:55.280]  luo which is Obama's tribe were raising this was also one of fueling the open
[41:55.280 --> 42:04.200]  avenue for jihadists to pour into Kenya because Odinga was the Islam-supported
[42:04.200 --> 42:09.360]  candidate in that election and if you recall remember they burned Christians
[42:09.360 --> 42:14.480]  and churches the luo did and they on behalf of Odinga they're using al-Qaeda
[42:14.480 --> 42:19.320]  worldwide as the proxy war to take over all these countries in North Africa and
[42:19.320 --> 42:24.680]  now into Kenya as you predicted six years ago as Dr. Tarpley predicted in
[42:24.680 --> 42:29.440]  the Obama deception this has been a plan you have all the documents this is how
[42:29.440 --> 42:32.240]  do they think they're going to get away with this and I want to get one more
[42:32.240 --> 42:37.600]  point on the record too because after remember Odinga lost the election in
[42:37.600 --> 42:42.680]  2007 but he became co-head of state memory became prime minister and that
[42:42.680 --> 42:48.320]  was a rain that was arranged by Obama together with Kofi Annan and the UN
[42:48.320 --> 42:53.080]  they intervened and they got Odinga made to be prime minister Odinga then went
[42:53.080 --> 42:57.880]  and engineered this new Kenyan Constitution which again I reported on
[42:57.880 --> 43:03.840]  Obama supported this with money we're using US foreign aid money to support
[43:03.840 --> 43:09.240]  the Constitution being passed in Kenya and the new Constitution included
[43:09.240 --> 43:14.840]  additional rights for Islam including rights to be ruled under Sharia law the
[43:14.840 --> 43:20.840]  whole constitutional revision in Kenya was an open door to Somali terrorists to
[43:20.840 --> 43:26.000]  foreign to the country it was engineered by Obama working with Odinga to
[43:26.000 --> 43:29.880]  re-engineer the Constitution of Kenya what is the master plan because you said
[43:29.880 --> 43:33.800]  a month ago here and you showed the court documents and the articles out of
[43:33.800 --> 43:38.840]  the out of Egypt and now it's happening that they're they're running the whole
[43:38.840 --> 43:43.760]  operation the whole takeover the money laundering out of Kenya that's right
[43:43.760 --> 43:50.680]  Obama's brother his half-brother Malik is and this is now come out verified
[43:50.680 --> 43:54.960]  by the Egyptian government on the head of the kind of one of the heads of the
[43:54.960 --> 43:58.640]  constitutional court that Malik Obama was running money for the Muslim
[43:58.640 --> 44:04.600]  Brotherhood in Egypt and also running money for a terrorist organization out
[44:04.600 --> 44:10.680]  of northern Sudan another terrorist state now I've also reported and can
[44:10.680 --> 44:17.800]  confirm the criminal charges have been filed in Kenya in Egypt under Malik
[44:17.800 --> 44:23.320]  Obama in Kenya and there's a subpoena out for him right now the Egyptians a
[44:23.320 --> 44:31.080]  criminal authorities are seeking Malik to bring him the brother of Obama to
[44:31.080 --> 44:37.120]  bring him to justice in Kenya for working with terrorists to manage money the
[44:37.120 --> 44:41.840]  Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt and the Sudan northern Sudan terrorists this
[44:41.840 --> 44:49.880]  Islamic Dawah organization that Malik also runs the money for now people got
[44:49.880 --> 44:55.520]  understand about Kenya the Kenya has been predominantly a Christian country
[44:55.520 --> 45:00.960]  I've been personally in the mall it's under attack in Kenya I was there it's a
[45:00.960 --> 45:05.760]  very beautiful open-air mall and it's very vulnerable to a terrorist attack
[45:05.760 --> 45:16.040]  are the jihadis who are in Kenya today were invited in open door Obama Odinga
[45:16.040 --> 45:21.480]  inviting them in from Somalia they're known to be terrorists and some of them
[45:21.480 --> 45:25.000]  are also recruited from the United States doctor let me stop you there
[45:25.000 --> 45:28.440]  because this is a selfish question I'm breaking this you're breaking this
[45:28.440 --> 45:32.280]  drudge has been breaking some of it yeah some talk radio Glenn Beck to his
[45:32.280 --> 45:34.960]  credit's been covering it some we're all in this together now that's when I
[45:34.960 --> 45:39.040]  really figured this out I mean this is this is not about being writers are
[45:39.040 --> 45:42.720]  being on TV or radio this is about survival for this country at this point
[45:42.720 --> 45:46.320]  I'm beginning to think this is a double-cross they're gonna turn everything
[45:46.320 --> 45:51.040]  over to radical Muslims and and and I've got reporters not just my crew but
[45:51.040 --> 45:54.160]  we're talking reporters who are actually being threatened by Saudi Arabian
[45:54.160 --> 45:57.880]  intelligence in Europe and the Middle East and now I've got reporters stuff
[45:57.880 --> 46:01.640]  out of movies where guys get around them and start saying you know videos and
[46:01.640 --> 46:05.220]  nice family I just thank God it happened to me because I got really mad have you
[46:05.220 --> 46:08.840]  been threatened and what is your security like I mean what do you think of
[46:08.840 --> 46:14.360]  of our reports of Saudi Arabia threatens to in career of AP reporter I mean it
[46:14.360 --> 46:17.360]  looks I'm getting sick of this I think it's accurate I think what you're
[46:17.360 --> 46:21.800]  reporting is correct I also think you're ahead of the curve and correct
[46:21.800 --> 46:30.680]  we've reported it on WND as well but the Saudis are behind the Islamic jihadists
[46:30.680 --> 46:36.520]  the Saudis are funding and are supporting al-Qaeda these are wars that are
[46:36.520 --> 46:41.720]  met largely over oil they're over the price of oil I agree with you there too
[46:41.720 --> 46:48.080]  Alex why are they so mad at us then well because see if the Obama has done
[46:48.080 --> 46:55.280]  carried the water for the al-Qaeda in it started in Kenya before Obama was
[46:55.280 --> 47:01.560]  elected when Obama and Odinga made this pact with the radical Islamists in Kenya
[47:01.560 --> 47:06.280]  that was going to allow al-Qaeda to come in the door through Somalia into Kenya
[47:06.280 --> 47:11.360]  a predominantly Christian country and when the violence occurred in Kenya they
[47:11.360 --> 47:16.240]  called it tribal violence which Odinga was using to gain power without
[47:16.240 --> 47:22.000]  reporting the Islamic nature of terrorism of this violence so Obama is lowering the
[47:22.000 --> 47:29.840]  drawbridge from Egypt to Syria to Kenya to Libya to Central Asia to everywhere to
[47:29.840 --> 47:34.600]  bring an al-Qaeda this is high treason what do we do well and we also and Alex
[47:34.600 --> 47:38.680]  you can connect the dots you also reported we've reported this is what
[47:38.680 --> 47:45.640]  ambassador Stevens was doing coming into Benghazi before he was ambassador he was
[47:45.640 --> 47:51.800]  running guns to al-Qaeda and Islamic jihadists backed by Saudi Arabia to
[47:51.800 --> 47:58.320]  destabilize Qaddafi the same way Obama welcomed in Morsi who was elected
[47:58.320 --> 48:02.080]  president after the so-called Arab Spring which was nothing about
[48:02.080 --> 48:09.200]  destabilizing northern Africa in favor of al-Qaeda and Saudi Arabia the Saudi
[48:09.200 --> 48:14.760]  Arabian forces are behind this because Saudi Arabia wants to control the price
[48:14.760 --> 48:19.800]  of oil Saudi Arabia does not want any challenge on that including you know a
[48:19.800 --> 48:25.160]  pipeline in the United States which Obama is against including a war on coal
[48:25.160 --> 48:29.360]  which Obama is running don't understand the Saudis have managed to get the price
[48:29.360 --> 48:33.240]  of oil under Obama to over a hundred dollars right for those that don't know
[48:33.240 --> 48:37.240]  this the Saudis are the biggest funders of shutting off the fact that we're coal
[48:37.240 --> 48:41.920]  rich well of course they don't want us having access to our own power and I'm
[48:41.920 --> 48:46.600]  sick of being like America is colonized by all these corrupt special interests
[48:46.600 --> 48:50.280]  it's disgusting and they want to limit the Saudis want to limit the amount of
[48:50.280 --> 48:58.440]  petroleum on the world market they also want to eliminate the Shiites in Iran and
[48:58.440 --> 49:06.760]  would be happy to force us into a false flag war CIA supported war in Syria in
[49:06.760 --> 49:13.120]  order to go after Assad who the United Nations has not said was the cause of the
[49:13.120 --> 49:18.040]  chemical weapons attack how big is it how big is it that the military is
[49:18.040 --> 49:20.840]  listening to you and I and others and that the joint chiefs went and told
[49:20.840 --> 49:25.840]  Obama no how big is that I think it's huge I think the military is listening
[49:25.840 --> 49:31.240]  to you Alex are reading W&D the military is realizing that their lives have been
[49:31.240 --> 49:37.080]  put in harm's way again on lies on you know there were no weapons of mass
[49:37.080 --> 49:40.880]  destruction that we found with Saddam Hussein you know they even going back to
[49:40.880 --> 49:47.840]  Gulf 91 fighting for Kuwait yes Kuwait was very important to the Saudis but
[49:47.840 --> 49:52.840]  Kuwait was not a national significant national security significance Kuwait
[49:52.840 --> 49:56.640]  was never going to attack the United States or Saddam Hussein was never going
[49:56.640 --> 50:01.360]  to attack the United States with taking over Kuwait but it was very important
[50:01.360 --> 50:07.800]  to the Saudis and it proposed the need for false flags in wars which are going
[50:07.800 --> 50:14.360]  on today in Syria and this is because again it would be the interest of the

[54:14.680 --> 54:18.280]  been clear since day one I'm not on the side of a side I don't like
[54:18.280 --> 54:23.520]  dictatorships but compared to what's being put in he's obviously better just
[54:23.520 --> 54:27.280]  like hazing the bark of Egypt and I was just talking to Dr. Corsinger in the
[54:27.280 --> 54:30.160]  break about all the Saudi Arabian intelligence crawling all over DC
[54:30.160 --> 54:33.760]  they've threatened our reporters before just filming in public come over and
[54:33.760 --> 54:38.800]  turn that off and the cops follow their orders and Saudi Arabia again is
[54:38.800 --> 54:43.480]  somebody you never hear about because they're right in the middle of it and
[54:43.480 --> 54:47.200]  Dr. Jerome Corsi I've got you in this segment the next another guest is coming
[54:47.200 --> 54:51.520]  up I appreciate your time you've got the floor where is this going how is Obama
[54:51.520 --> 54:57.600]  doing how crippled is he what do you expect to see come next and how do we
[54:57.600 --> 55:01.680]  stop these people how do we get back on a course to sanity well you got to
[55:01.680 --> 55:07.920]  remember Obama's just their current agent in place Obama's just doing the
[55:07.920 --> 55:11.800]  bidding for the Saudis he's doing his following his orders remember collect
[55:11.800 --> 55:17.720]  the dots to in the Saudis remember that John Brennan who heads our CIA as far as
[55:17.720 --> 55:23.800]  I'm concerned has quietly and secretly converted to Islam I believe that about
[55:23.800 --> 55:28.800]  Brennan for a long time remember Brennan was the guy whose security firm helps
[55:28.800 --> 55:35.480]  sanitize Obama's passport records before the 2008 election the two guys who
[55:35.480 --> 55:40.320]  broke into the passport office to seize Obama's passport records worked for
[55:40.320 --> 55:45.480]  Brennan and they never got picked up they never got apprehended and Brennan
[55:45.480 --> 55:50.800]  advances himself to head of the CIA from National Security Advisor in the White
[55:50.800 --> 55:56.600]  House and Brennan is on the record many times as supporting jihadists as
[55:56.600 --> 56:03.400]  supporting radical Islam as far as I can tell you know Brennan speaks fluent
[56:03.400 --> 56:07.360]  Arabic he spent time excessively in the region as far as I can tell he's
[56:07.360 --> 56:15.480]  converted in my as well be considered to be heading our CIA as a pro-Wahabi is
[56:15.480 --> 56:25.800]  supporting quietly friend ally promoter puppet of the Saudis and the false flag
[56:25.800 --> 56:32.120]  in Syria has already occurred it was the chemical attack and we've published I
[56:32.120 --> 56:36.920]  published on W&D the films of the rebels launching the case the attack of the
[56:36.920 --> 56:42.040]  chemicals not the government the UN has been over there twice now the UN has
[56:42.040 --> 56:46.840]  never said or attributed responsibility to Assad yet you've got John Kerry out
[56:46.840 --> 56:52.680]  there promoting that Assad is guilty and pumping this false flag it's the intent
[56:52.680 --> 56:58.640]  to send US military in the harms way for a cause that is not in US interest but
[56:58.640 --> 57:04.480]  will support al-Qaeda jihadists and other criminals that are funded by Saudi
[57:04.480 --> 57:12.320]  Arabia that's the truth that that's how the dots connect unfortunately that's
[57:12.320 --> 57:16.600]  the only way they connect now because I think you're becoming I think Americans
[57:16.600 --> 57:21.560]  are getting the point Alex I think you broadcast we're working in W&D
[57:21.560 --> 57:28.000]  diligently to get the information the American people that we are al-Qaeda we've
[57:28.000 --> 57:33.000]  always been al-Qaeda go back to the roots of the Bush family and the bin Laden
[57:33.000 --> 57:37.840]  family tied together I mean even Michael Moore and his film was dot was
[57:37.840 --> 57:42.680]  documenting the bin Laden family connections with the Bush family
[57:42.680 --> 57:47.400]  connection I've noticed this Dr. Corsi you can criticize anybody but you go after
[57:47.400 --> 57:53.960]  Saudi Arabia all hell breaks loose go back to World War two when FDR met with
[57:53.960 --> 57:59.640]  the head of the Saudi family on a boat in the Mediterranean as way to one of the
[57:59.640 --> 58:04.680]  early summits in World War two and the deal was made that we were going to use
[58:04.680 --> 58:09.560]  our oil in World War two and the Saudis were going to back us up we had Saudi
[58:09.560 --> 58:15.840]  Arabia oil connections going back to pre World War two era and if you trace it
[58:15.840 --> 58:19.920]  far enough you'll find British petroleum and Winston Churchill right in the
[58:19.920 --> 58:24.680]  middle of it with Iranian oil going back you know to the conversion of the
[58:24.680 --> 58:31.000]  British Navy from cold cold oil this you know it's so much of our of our new
[58:31.000 --> 58:37.000]  world order is based upon the politics of oil to benefit those shoe families you
[58:37.000 --> 58:41.060]  know the bush stay there stay there back I'm 60

[01:00:04.400 --> 01:00:12.200]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[01:00:12.200 --> 01:00:19.720]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[01:00:19.720 --> 01:00:27.360]  Alex Jones we're now into our number two Bob Fletcher who was a Iran
[01:00:27.360 --> 01:00:30.680]  contra whistleblower is going to be joining us for a couple segments I wanted
[01:00:30.680 --> 01:00:35.400]  to get his take on things Dr. Jerome Corsi best-selling author working at
[01:00:35.400 --> 01:00:40.240]  highest levels of international finance and also for the State Department as a
[01:00:40.240 --> 01:00:44.520]  consultant really an expert of experts on what's happening in the Middle East
[01:00:44.520 --> 01:00:51.120]  and think of America now as a castle that doesn't have walls anymore we're
[01:00:51.120 --> 01:00:54.960]  wide open to any special interest the American people aren't organized except
[01:00:54.960 --> 01:01:01.000]  around football and all these special interests are just running wild to the
[01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:06.840]  point of they have such disrespect for us Obama signs in order two weeks ago to
[01:01:06.840 --> 01:01:10.200]  legalize what he's already doing but I've read the code it doesn't legalize it
[01:01:10.200 --> 01:01:15.920]  to be able to arm Al Qaeda and you've got this plan to turn basically half the
[01:01:15.920 --> 01:01:21.320]  world over to Al Qaeda while using the Al Qaeda threat to take our liberties here
[01:01:21.320 --> 01:01:25.960]  domestically Dr. Corsi you were getting into the power of Saudi Arabia earlier
[01:01:25.960 --> 01:01:29.120]  but but in the three four minutes we have left you've got the floor here
[01:01:29.120 --> 01:01:34.400]  finishing up how do we stop this what do you what are you worried about coming
[01:01:34.400 --> 01:01:38.400]  down the road what do we do well I want people first understand that it was
[01:01:38.400 --> 01:01:45.880]  Obama and Odinga Obama's Luol cousin who was you know after violence and losing
[01:01:45.880 --> 01:01:50.520]  the election prompted by agreements that discussions between Obama and Odinga
[01:01:50.520 --> 01:01:54.000]  Odinga got to be co-head of state and opened the door with the new
[01:01:54.000 --> 01:02:00.800]  Constitution to Al Qaeda coming in to Kenya through Somalia Kenya used to be a
[01:02:00.800 --> 01:02:05.840]  90% Christian country it was very stable but between Obama and Odinga
[01:02:05.840 --> 01:02:12.880]  Kenya's been destabilized you now see massive Somalian terrorist Al Qaeda
[01:02:12.880 --> 01:02:20.280]  linked groups operative in Kenya and this attack on the mall is a shocking
[01:02:20.280 --> 01:02:25.040]  indication of how powerful these Al Qaeda groups have come they're killing
[01:02:25.040 --> 01:02:30.440]  Christians in the mall who can't give answers as to who the Muslim Muhammad's
[01:02:30.440 --> 01:02:34.800]  mother was and other questions with regards to Islam this is the Saudis
[01:02:34.800 --> 01:02:43.440]  backing Al Qaeda joined by Obama backing Al Qaeda and in terms of false flags the
[01:02:43.440 --> 01:02:49.240]  false flags have already occurred these entire chemical attack Bruce in Syria
[01:02:49.240 --> 01:02:54.560]  which is a ploy to get our military to go along again and put their lives at
[01:02:54.560 --> 01:03:02.000]  risk for oil for the interests of the Saudis to combat Iran and you know Obama
[01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:09.720]  is in the process right now of funding Al Qaeda throughout northern Africa
[01:03:09.720 --> 01:03:15.960]  including from Libya with the worst terrorists armed with weapons that we
[01:03:15.960 --> 01:03:22.600]  provided in part being brought into Syria for these Al Qaeda and other jihadists
[01:03:22.600 --> 01:03:27.440]  through Turkey and and this is what Ambassador Stevens was at the center
[01:03:27.440 --> 01:03:32.000]  it's why Benghazi is still a lie it's why on Bible will tell us what he was doing
[01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:37.120]  that night when we let these guys die and Benghazi without bringing
[01:03:37.120 --> 01:03:43.320]  military to try to save them so people got to wake up and understand that the
[01:03:43.320 --> 01:03:49.080]  lies here have been going on since before World War two and this new World
[01:03:49.080 --> 01:03:53.560]  Order crowd the things that they can you know create international structures
[01:03:53.560 --> 01:03:59.440]  international finance and push everybody around on lies of Al Qaeda when in
[01:03:59.440 --> 01:04:04.840]  fact we are Al Qaeda the Saudis are Al Qaeda and people have got to get that
[01:04:04.840 --> 01:04:07.800]  point through their heads
[01:04:08.880 --> 01:04:14.440]  that's very powerful stuff Alex but I can back it all up I know I know I know
[01:04:14.440 --> 01:04:19.800]  it's all there publicly and it's so frustrating and I have the sense of
[01:04:19.800 --> 01:04:23.280]  dread for our society on one hand but the other hand I see a big awakening
[01:04:23.280 --> 01:04:27.600]  the power structure better not be worried about us they better be worried
[01:04:27.600 --> 01:04:32.400]  about the military waking up well the military wakes up and realizes how many
[01:04:32.400 --> 01:04:39.720]  men and women have been killed in Maine over you know lies what I mean the lie
[01:04:39.720 --> 01:04:46.120]  was to get into Iraq in the first place in 1991 over Kuwait which insignificant
[01:04:46.120 --> 01:04:50.800]  to US national security interests and George HW Bush proclaiming during that
[01:04:50.800 --> 01:04:54.960]  war to speech to Congress new World Order we should that was the clip that

[01:08:35.360 --> 01:08:39.840]  in the near future but I wanted to get Bob Fletcher steak on why government is
[01:08:39.840 --> 01:08:44.120]  running around like a chicken with its head cut off trying to gear up for war
[01:08:44.120 --> 01:08:47.920]  with people not just here but in every other country is it the world economic
[01:08:47.920 --> 01:08:53.880]  meltdown is it the derivatives overhang is it QE unlimited but I wanted to get
[01:08:53.880 --> 01:08:59.520]  Bob's take as well if you just joined us Dr. Jerome course he was just on going
[01:08:59.520 --> 01:09:02.840]  over all the documents all the admissions that our government through
[01:09:02.840 --> 01:09:07.160]  Obama and Saudi Arabia and others is funding Al Qaeda jihadists a turn
[01:09:07.160 --> 01:09:12.440]  basically the entire Middle East North Africa and even Kenya over to him and
[01:09:12.440 --> 01:09:17.520]  clearly these are the groups brought in by Odinga and others in the last six
[01:09:17.520 --> 01:09:22.360]  seven years and Obama advised them on all this and and I know the government
[01:09:22.360 --> 01:09:26.000]  winds up Al Qaeda and helps them and then uses them as a threat to take our
[01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:30.720]  liberties and they use them to attack the Serbs and attack the Russians and but
[01:09:30.720 --> 01:09:40.120]  now it's just moving headlong forward and reporters are getting harassed all the
[01:09:40.120 --> 01:09:44.320]  stuff's going on this article is up on info wars.com Saudi Arabia threatens to
[01:09:44.320 --> 01:09:49.680]  end career of AP reporter over chemical weapons story that's up on info wars.com
[01:09:49.680 --> 01:09:57.160]  what's happened here is we're such open societies that mafias have come in they've
[01:09:57.160 --> 01:10:01.960]  taken over Europe they've taken over the US and Saudi Arabia is only one small
[01:10:01.960 --> 01:10:08.040]  part of this mafia but very central obviously in the Middle East and Bandar
[01:10:08.040 --> 01:10:13.200]  Bush as he's known because he was such good friends of the Bush family came out
[01:10:13.200 --> 01:10:15.920]  a few weeks ago and threatened the Russians with Al Qaeda attacking the
[01:10:15.920 --> 01:10:21.120]  Olympics if they didn't back off in Syria and then now the the foreign
[01:10:21.120 --> 01:10:25.880]  minister of Russia is in the news saying we're being pressured by Saudi Arabia and
[01:10:25.880 --> 01:10:32.400]  the United States and so he says to back off and let them have Syria or we're
[01:10:32.400 --> 01:10:40.040]  gonna regret it I mean this is wild and you got the US aggressively with NATO
[01:10:40.040 --> 01:10:47.640]  for almost three years attacking Syria and it's so immoral and it's so naked and
[01:10:47.640 --> 01:10:53.760]  the average person is either waking up or getting more dumbed down I mean I was
[01:10:53.760 --> 01:10:58.200]  near downtown a few days ago doing a video shoot last week and then it was on
[01:10:58.200 --> 01:11:04.000]  like Wednesday and there were already people
[01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:10.800]  parking their RVs and cars to tailgate for a football game what was UT here this
[01:11:10.800 --> 01:11:15.000]  weekend they were I mean I didn't even check or no I just could tell it was UT
[01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:19.880]  people all their UT stuff and if there's you there's these adult males will
[01:11:19.880 --> 01:11:24.280]  run up to you and and basically you know I'm really depressed UT lost and stuff
[01:11:24.280 --> 01:11:28.440]  and I'm just like man we're worried about nuclear war here collapse of
[01:11:28.440 --> 01:11:33.280]  society and it's because the men in this country and I'm not knocking you
[01:11:33.280 --> 01:11:37.720]  if you're a sports fan but you know if you spend 15 hours a day playing video
[01:11:37.720 --> 01:11:41.160]  games or 10 hours a day watching sports because you spend one hour a week for
[01:11:41.160 --> 01:11:46.080]  freedom or getting informed I'm just really freaked out right now I mean I'm
[01:11:46.080 --> 01:11:52.560]  getting really freaked out because it it's all out in the open now it's out in
[01:11:52.560 --> 01:11:55.960]  the open that the rebels launched the chemical attack Bob Fletcher businessman
[01:11:55.960 --> 01:12:00.960]  inventor film producer speaker and author after years of business as a
[01:12:00.960 --> 01:12:04.000]  professional career Bob became involved in the US government top-secret covert
[01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:09.440]  arms sales he's testified as a top witness to Iran Contra his company
[01:12:09.440 --> 01:12:15.400]  basically infiltrated by the CIA taken over as a front company and Bob Fletcher
[01:12:15.400 --> 01:12:19.680]  investigations comm is his site and and we've told your story Bob I just wanted
[01:12:19.680 --> 01:12:22.960]  to get your take today and then we'll get into why you think they're gearing up
[01:12:22.960 --> 01:12:26.360]  for all this I wanted to get your take on the state of the world what's
[01:12:26.360 --> 01:12:31.720]  happening how crazy it is 91% Reuters poll against the war so that's good
[01:12:31.720 --> 01:12:36.720]  news I see an awakening happening on one end but the crazies run things and then
[01:12:36.720 --> 01:12:41.160]  the rest of the public are zombies and I just have a feeling of dread for and
[01:12:41.160 --> 01:12:44.600]  everybody else I talked to that's a business person or successful or
[01:12:44.600 --> 01:12:50.160]  informed they have the same sense that we're about to witness biblical things
[01:12:50.160 --> 01:12:56.400]  basically Bob Fletcher right well that part I absolutely agree with and you
[01:12:56.400 --> 01:13:02.240]  know last night I was watching with my wife we were watching the introductions
[01:13:02.240 --> 01:13:10.000]  on a whole slew of the new television programs completely garbage that I mean
[01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:16.560]  it it embarrasses me it embarrasses me that my fellow Americans would even
[01:13:16.560 --> 01:13:22.840]  watch the garbage that they're producing to fill infiltrate their brain and fill
[01:13:22.840 --> 01:13:28.280]  it with trash so that they don't even recognize what's going on like what
[01:13:28.280 --> 01:13:32.920]  you're talking about the the excess to the sports and all of that ridiculous
[01:13:32.920 --> 01:13:37.000]  you know again you know God bless you if you're supporting your team you know
[01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:41.520]  but don't spend five days leading up to a football game you know what happened
[01:13:41.520 --> 01:13:45.280]  to your kids what happened that week to your family and what happened to the
[01:13:45.280 --> 01:13:49.560]  world while you were out there trying to buy the extra couple of six packs of
[01:13:49.560 --> 01:13:54.520]  beer to throw into your RV to go to the football game five days down the road I
[01:13:54.520 --> 01:14:02.080]  mean it's absolutely insane I can't understand how the how successful the
[01:14:02.080 --> 01:14:08.720]  bad guys in government have been in the last 35 years in turning our entire
[01:14:08.720 --> 01:14:16.120]  American culture into sponge brains it's unbelievable it's embarrassing
[01:14:16.120 --> 01:14:22.800]  personally shocking and embarrassing now as you know I have been chasing bad
[01:14:22.800 --> 01:14:27.480]  guys in government for 35 years or something like that at this point in
[01:14:27.480 --> 01:14:34.560]  time that the entire second last half of my life and so it got and after being
[01:14:34.560 --> 01:14:38.360]  involved with a multitude of investigations out of the Senate the
[01:14:38.360 --> 01:14:43.160]  Congress and being a federal witness a couple of times and a whistleblower on
[01:14:43.160 --> 01:14:49.440]  multitude of times unfortunately not having anybody of sufficient strength
[01:14:49.440 --> 01:14:54.200]  to listen to any of us you know we're being a whistleblower is fine but if
[01:14:54.200 --> 01:14:58.920]  nobody hears the whistle it doesn't matter I guess but I've been doing that
[01:14:58.920 --> 01:15:05.000]  for years and years and to and it became it became a regular recognized thing
[01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:10.520]  that people were stealing multiple millions of dollars if you had a foot
[01:15:10.520 --> 01:15:16.400]  or a finger in the pie in Washington DC somehow you and your buddy could get away
[01:15:16.400 --> 01:15:21.440]  with a few million bucks you could always get a an extra couple of a few
[01:15:21.440 --> 01:15:25.600]  thousand bucks for this and that a couple of million bucks for an extra
[01:15:25.600 --> 01:15:30.320]  whatever a project maybe your family wanted to do and things of that sort if
[01:15:30.320 --> 01:15:35.800]  you were had had your finger in the pie and had a friend inside all right and
[01:15:35.800 --> 01:15:40.160]  that became regular that's left of a few million here and a few million there
[01:15:40.160 --> 01:15:45.560]  didn't mean very much but then I recognized a while back that we were
[01:15:45.560 --> 01:15:52.360]  talking billions of dollars disappearing and then believe it or not it
[01:15:52.360 --> 01:15:58.160]  became a recognized that it was trillions of dollars two point two
[01:15:58.160 --> 01:16:04.200]  trillion missing from the Pentagon alone as of 2001 that's correct but to put the
[01:16:04.200 --> 01:16:10.960]  icing on the cake how about the nine trillion dollars on from the Federal
[01:16:10.960 --> 01:16:15.960]  Reserve that just vanished and it vanished apparently now wait a minute now
[01:16:15.960 --> 01:16:21.040]  I'm gonna say that again nine trillion dollars the Senate the Congress
[01:16:21.040 --> 01:16:27.600]  investigated and asked directly the investigative branch the lady that was
[01:16:27.600 --> 01:16:32.480]  in charge of theoretically doing maintaining audits and maintaining
[01:16:32.480 --> 01:16:38.280]  oversight on the Federal Reserve and she was asked directly what about nine
[01:16:38.280 --> 01:16:44.080]  trillion on off the books indicated money with the Federal Reserve that
[01:16:44.080 --> 01:16:50.160]  vanished someplace into European banks I remember that we've played that clip in
[01:16:50.160 --> 01:16:56.320]  fact that clip is in is it is in fall the Republic exactly so they can steal
[01:16:56.320 --> 01:17:00.960]  trillions why not arm al-qaeda publicly why not have Obama sign an order that he
[01:17:00.960 --> 01:17:05.600]  can arm al-qaeda like he did two weeks ago they just do whatever they want it's
[01:17:05.600 --> 01:17:10.920]  mind-boggling and this lady now she was one and she was the what they call it the
[01:17:10.920 --> 01:17:18.080]  uh-oh missing the word but anyhow she was the in charge of oversight doing a
[01:17:18.080 --> 01:17:23.920]  potentially any oversight auditing of what was going on and they said are you
[01:17:23.920 --> 01:17:29.920]  investigating that the fact that there apparently is nine trillion disappeared
[01:17:29.920 --> 01:17:34.120]  into European banks someplace and she said well we don't call it an
[01:17:34.120 --> 01:17:39.000]  investigation we we like to look into it but I'm not sure what you're talking
[01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:44.080]  about and of course she really did but she was kind of stuck that somebody had
[01:17:44.080 --> 01:17:47.560]  even a bottom line what's gonna happen all right so what we're looking at it
[01:17:47.560 --> 01:17:52.000]  is trillions of money's disappeared millions and trillions the gold is all
[01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:56.000]  going out of Fort Knox if anybody thinks there's a dollar thirty five worth of
[01:17:56.000 --> 01:18:00.040]  gold left in there because when you had foreign nations asked for their own gold
[01:18:00.040 --> 01:18:03.720]  back the United States told them it would take seven years before they could
[01:18:03.720 --> 01:18:09.240]  give them an audit so the gold is going from Fort Knox trillions disappearing
[01:18:09.240 --> 01:18:14.560]  from major financial institutions and it would you have to say where can it go
[01:18:14.560 --> 01:18:20.000]  because you can't steal that much and hide it you cannot launder a trillion
[01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:24.560]  dollars that's a physical impossibility now if you are the government and you
[01:18:24.560 --> 01:18:30.360]  are building hundreds of underground facilities which is going on and you are
[01:18:30.360 --> 01:18:34.920]  assisting the Russians to build five thousand of them underground and the
[01:18:34.920 --> 01:18:39.480]  other nations of the world to your assisting with arm our tax dollars to
[01:18:39.480 --> 01:18:44.240]  build underground facilities and they are putting in multi millions of
[01:18:44.240 --> 01:18:51.120]  dollars into weapons to to shoot rioters on the street there they're
[01:18:51.120 --> 01:18:55.040]  spending all this money cutting deals with Russia to bring over extra people
[01:18:55.040 --> 01:19:00.320]  to assist in the time of need they're training 24-7 for open war against us
[01:19:00.320 --> 01:19:04.400]  it's high treason okay now here's so I have to sit back and I said well wait a
[01:19:04.400 --> 01:19:08.840]  minute what's going on so of course then with just a little more inquiry a
[01:19:08.840 --> 01:19:11.800]  little more snooping and a few more people coming to you from under the
[01:19:11.800 --> 01:19:20.400]  table the bottom line is simply this they are fully anticipating a catastrophic
[01:19:20.400 --> 01:19:26.360]  celestial impact that's the terminology they used when they were cutting the
[01:19:26.360 --> 01:19:30.320]  deal with the Russians to bring assistance over here when needed for
[01:19:30.320 --> 01:19:37.160]  FEMA for the federal emergency they are anticipating a celestial impact we I
[01:19:37.160 --> 01:19:41.960]  happen to know and by the way all of this is on a new video that I'm trying to
[01:19:41.960 --> 01:19:46.320]  get out I've never had so much trouble in my life I've had entire computers
[01:19:46.320 --> 01:19:50.640]  burn up on me in the last two last seven months on this thing literally there
[01:19:50.640 --> 01:19:53.840]  they're doing a number on me to stop by the way it's funny you mentioned that
[01:19:53.840 --> 01:19:56.760]  because they admit that's the plan to set up real government is for a defense

[01:24:21.600 --> 01:24:26.560]  Chuck Yeager when I'm talking about him he was a big part of the Iran
[01:24:26.560 --> 01:24:30.320]  Contra hearings a key person just because they came in and wanted to be
[01:24:30.320 --> 01:24:34.680]  partners with his toy company it was very successful and then it was a CIA front
[01:24:34.680 --> 01:24:38.480]  and they said this is the way it is and generals and CIA would come traipsing in
[01:24:38.480 --> 01:24:43.040]  like in a movie like spies like us when it's the you know fruit company or
[01:24:43.040 --> 01:24:47.000]  whatever that's exactly how it works ladies and gentlemen I've had family
[01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:51.520]  where the CIA's come and said well we you know you've got some other family in the
[01:24:51.520 --> 01:24:54.920]  CIA and you're a good family we want your business to be a front for us and
[01:24:54.920 --> 01:24:59.840]  obviously the family said no but this is huge and we'll have him with us about
[01:24:59.840 --> 01:25:04.080]  45 after that I'll get to all the other news there's a lot of it but Bob this is
[01:25:04.080 --> 01:25:10.360]  a short segment I want to ask you right now is your gut telling you something's
[01:25:10.360 --> 01:25:14.280]  wrong because I mean they don't care of nuclear reactors are melting down now
[01:25:14.280 --> 01:25:18.440]  they used to care they used to care and not let troops use DU now they don't
[01:25:18.440 --> 01:25:23.000]  care I mean it's like the devil runs things and they're persecuting all
[01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:27.040]  forms of goodness I mean I know they've got underground base program that's for
[01:25:27.040 --> 01:25:30.360]  nuclear war and they say it's for asteroids and I mean I know all that's
[01:25:30.360 --> 01:25:33.720]  going on and you have sources on it but it seems like there's something else
[01:25:33.720 --> 01:25:40.560]  going on well yet you know no it's no primarily that's it what what it is they
[01:25:40.560 --> 01:25:44.680]  had all of a sudden discovered and was prime let's put it this way it was a
[01:25:44.680 --> 01:25:50.360]  vague possibility a while back that there was going to be that this 10th
[01:25:50.360 --> 01:25:55.600]  planet the Nibiru planet X whatever you want to call it was potentially way out
[01:25:55.600 --> 01:25:59.160]  there and it's going to come back and make a circle through all right well that
[01:25:59.160 --> 01:26:04.320]  was kind of close to earth and that was kind of a maybe possibility kind of a
[01:26:04.320 --> 01:26:09.600]  thing but someplace around 1983 and I was verified by a central intelligence
[01:26:09.600 --> 01:26:16.720]  person friend of mine out of Washington at such a high level that this
[01:26:16.720 --> 01:26:21.240]  particular agent used to write speeches for Reagan and Bill Casey with Bill
[01:26:21.240 --> 01:26:26.000]  Casey for a long time head of the CIA anyhow the bottom line was that about
[01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:30.520]  83 sometime in that period of time they had some kind of a confirmation that
[01:26:30.520 --> 01:26:35.600]  hey this thing is coming back and it's going to take it's going to take a few
[01:26:35.600 --> 01:26:40.360]  years it might take 20 years or so but it absolutely will be coming back and
[01:26:40.360 --> 01:26:45.200]  they started at that point in time expanding the underground facilities and
[01:26:45.200 --> 01:26:49.200]  all of that and it's got nothing to do with nuclear or anything what it has to
[01:26:49.200 --> 01:26:53.960]  do in reality all of this whole and it what irritates me more than anything is
[01:26:53.960 --> 01:26:58.720]  they have kept all this totally secret from the general public they've lied and
[01:26:58.720 --> 01:27:02.840]  covered up about that man said oh no it was this that the other thing but they
[01:27:02.840 --> 01:27:09.440]  have taken every single possible dollar bill and gold bar that they can and it
[01:27:09.440 --> 01:27:14.440]  is gone it's out of here and it has either been directly applied to the
[01:27:14.440 --> 01:27:21.040]  construction of these hideout survival facilities for the limited few and by
[01:27:21.040 --> 01:27:24.280]  the way it's been coming out in the news what are these giant concrete
[01:27:24.280 --> 01:27:29.000]  fortresses in the Ozarks and other areas and then it turns out there's bases
[01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:32.920]  under them and they're really like a underground train station above ground
[01:27:32.920 --> 01:27:36.040]  terminal that's what I've been told by people involved in the construction
[01:27:36.040 --> 01:27:41.240]  this is that particular construction you're talking about by 72,000 square
[01:27:41.240 --> 01:27:45.720]  feet it's registered as a private party home the guy the guy's a central
[01:27:45.720 --> 01:27:50.840]  intelligent operative and a genius that has put together many of the spy
[01:27:50.840 --> 01:27:56.280]  electronic web operations that are used by our military that's the fella his
[01:27:56.280 --> 01:28:00.840]  name's Steven Huff he's a fella that owns this particular large construct it is
[01:28:00.840 --> 01:28:06.000]  the fourth largest house in the United States it makes Bill Gates place look
[01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:11.120]  like an outhouse well the truth is he was given the NSA satellite patents on a
[01:28:11.120 --> 01:28:14.360]  bunch of stuff to be given tens of billions but he's really just the front
[01:28:14.360 --> 01:28:18.960]  for a government operations my and my information most likely that's exactly
[01:28:18.960 --> 01:28:23.280]  the situation now where his home is located which is over top of this
[01:28:23.280 --> 01:28:28.840]  multi thousand miles of tunnels under the ground which I was told about in
[01:28:28.840 --> 01:28:34.800]  95 I got some pictures of it in 95 didn't believe it and have been
[01:28:34.800 --> 01:28:39.240]  pursuing it ever since it's absolutely a reality the tunnels there's so many
[01:28:39.240 --> 01:28:42.960]  tunnels under the United States with these connecting things it's like a
[01:28:42.960 --> 01:28:48.480]  spider web of tunnels beneath the ground now here's the bottom line they've
[01:28:48.480 --> 01:28:53.240]  taken all of this money every cent that belongs to the United States taxpayers
[01:28:53.240 --> 01:28:59.400]  they totally kept its secret they are absolutely awaiting the incoming of this
[01:28:59.400 --> 01:29:06.200]  of this out this this this huge 10th 10th planet is what it amounts to be
[01:29:06.200 --> 01:29:13.240]  as in this gigantic huge orbital configuration takes it like 3,000
[01:29:13.240 --> 01:29:16.480]  years to come around and it's in the Kuiper belt well then what about all the
[01:29:16.480 --> 01:29:20.680]  false starts where they said it was going to come a decade ago and all that
[01:29:20.680 --> 01:29:27.160]  well and I can't account for all of that I know some of it's misinterpretation
[01:29:27.160 --> 01:29:32.520]  of different things but but watching the way the budgeting has been going with
[01:29:32.520 --> 01:29:38.360]  them all of a sudden rushing bullets and weapons buying that up by the by
[01:29:38.360 --> 01:29:43.760]  billions of dollars of weapons to control riots they will stay there let's
[01:29:43.760 --> 01:29:47.440]  come back Bob Pletcher this is important information then I'm going to shift

[01:33:23.280 --> 01:33:31.040]  you know Bob Fletcher is a really smart guy and I know that it was Lyndon LaRouche
[01:33:31.040 --> 01:33:35.360]  that went and met with Reagan and others that's when George Bush Jr. got
[01:33:35.360 --> 01:33:39.080]  really really jealous this all came out you can pull this up in the Washington
[01:33:39.080 --> 01:33:42.280]  Post some of the media is discredited Lyndon LaRouche so you hear that name
[01:33:42.280 --> 01:33:45.760]  like Lyndon LaRouche isn't that the guy that's a right winger or a left winger
[01:33:45.760 --> 01:33:50.080]  or the guy that paints Hitler mustaches on Obama and you can say what you want
[01:33:50.080 --> 01:33:52.360]  about the LaRouche movement I don't agree with some of their aims but their
[01:33:52.360 --> 01:33:57.640]  analysis is spot-on he was in meetings with the head of the CIA in the 80s over
[01:33:57.640 --> 01:34:01.080]  and over again and with Reagan which made the whole power structure very
[01:34:01.080 --> 01:34:07.320]  jealous and they said put SDI up for an anti-media program and I know then
[01:34:07.320 --> 01:34:11.320]  because LaRouche said it on air they were very concerned about comments other
[01:34:11.320 --> 01:34:15.680]  things that we know especially since Shoemaker leaving when they discovered
[01:34:15.680 --> 01:34:19.360]  that comment and then predicted accurately that it would hit one of the
[01:34:19.360 --> 01:34:25.000]  super gas giants was it Jupiter or Saturn always get it yeah it hit Jupiter
[01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:30.160]  I always get that factoid backwards and it blew like giant holes bigger than
[01:34:30.160 --> 01:34:34.160]  the earth and in the gas giant the point is is that I have seen their concern
[01:34:34.160 --> 01:34:38.560]  about that but that really they were going to use space-based weapon systems
[01:34:38.560 --> 01:34:43.080]  the cover would be a defensive system I know the US and Russia have had meetings
[01:34:43.080 --> 01:34:47.040]  at the UN I'm just backing up with Fletcher saying and they claim their
[01:34:47.040 --> 01:34:51.000]  building underground bases and COG that's a continuity of government systems
[01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:57.280]  for comets asteroids I think the term planet X has become more of a art type
[01:34:57.280 --> 01:35:04.000]  of all this debris we know there's hundreds of planetoid size spheres you
[01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:07.520]  moon size and smaller out in the Kuiper belt that they've now picked up with
[01:35:07.520 --> 01:35:11.920]  radio telescopes and a lot of them supposedly have these elliptical orbits
[01:35:11.920 --> 01:35:16.560]  and do come through and the ancients all recorded these things coming close and
[01:35:16.560 --> 01:35:19.800]  you know then you get mountain shooting up a thousand feet in the air and lava
[01:35:19.800 --> 01:35:24.400]  spraying out previously they thought every 10 million years or something a
[01:35:24.400 --> 01:35:27.400]  big asteroid hit the earth we now know they're thinking it's every couple
[01:35:27.400 --> 01:35:31.880]  hundred and so they think they're on time to have this I think the planet X
[01:35:31.880 --> 01:35:35.960]  because I heard about it in 99 2003 I always thought it was baloney that it
[01:35:35.960 --> 01:35:39.480]  was gonna hit us and of course Bob didn't say it was gonna hit us then my
[01:35:39.480 --> 01:35:44.280]  point is is kind of an excuse for COG I'm not disagreeing with you that they're
[01:35:44.280 --> 01:35:48.680]  concerned about it Bob I just think the CIA guy high level that was telling you
[01:35:48.680 --> 01:35:53.320]  this might have been putting a false story on you partially false or he may
[01:35:53.320 --> 01:35:57.360]  have been fed it himself do you get my point I'm making yeah but that's not
[01:35:57.360 --> 01:36:03.080]  right but you you don't even have the very weakest scratch surface you can't
[01:36:03.080 --> 01:36:09.480]  imagine how much real statistics are on this all right first off the you know
[01:36:09.480 --> 01:36:16.320]  that the solar the solar flare situation right it's been acknowledged by NASA not
[01:36:16.320 --> 01:36:21.160]  that this is an 11-year cycle the solar flares have been the most outrageous
[01:36:21.160 --> 01:36:27.080]  they have been in a thousand years but that's solar flares that's being
[01:36:27.080 --> 01:36:34.680]  affected already by the by Nibiru by the planet X planet X is can is is
[01:36:34.680 --> 01:36:41.560]  estimated to be five times the size of Bert Wolsey James Wolsey head of the
[01:36:41.560 --> 01:36:47.120]  CIA been out a couple of years a few months ago he said there is no question
[01:36:47.120 --> 01:36:52.440]  in our mind that we will have a solar flare with the potential or several of
[01:36:52.440 --> 01:36:57.680]  them the potential to shut down all electronics on the on either the earth
[01:36:57.680 --> 01:37:02.200]  or half the globe that's right Nibiru is supposed to be bigger than Jupiter
[01:37:02.200 --> 01:37:07.840]  correct it's five times the size of Earth is probably the size of Jupiter
[01:37:07.840 --> 01:37:15.200]  nothing Jupiter's like 300 times the point is it will pass around it will
[01:37:15.200 --> 01:37:21.560]  come close I'll go around the Sun and we will run through the tail of this thing
[01:37:21.560 --> 01:37:27.560]  which has like 4,000 miles of garbage so we have so many meteorites and
[01:37:27.560 --> 01:37:32.720]  potential small pieces of junk hitting us why have we had we have already had
[01:37:32.720 --> 01:37:38.560]  more meteorites than we usually do in five years in the world in the last two
[01:37:38.560 --> 01:37:44.880]  years that's also already being affected by Nibiru coming back wait a minute
[01:37:44.880 --> 01:37:49.520]  I gotta stop you right now and my wife is a witness to this and I just
[01:37:49.520 --> 01:37:54.280]  entered twilight zone I was down at the beach it just some funky condominiums
[01:37:54.280 --> 01:38:00.000]  we go and rent for two or three days ago fishing down in Port Aransas and a guy
[01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:04.680]  comes in knocks on my door who and he said he was gonna email it to do go see
[01:38:04.680 --> 01:38:09.200]  the email to do because I gave him his email does always miss stuff my never
[01:38:09.200 --> 01:38:13.040]  check mine the point is I might as well not even have email he comes in knocks
[01:38:13.040 --> 01:38:22.200]  on my door and says I want to send you these photos that I took and he was
[01:38:22.200 --> 01:38:26.400]  bringing up Planet X to me and he was saying look at this this was taken in
[01:38:26.400 --> 01:38:29.320]  Austin a week ago it's funny I ran into you here I thought it was really weird
[01:38:29.320 --> 01:38:34.160]  and he was showing me photos of in broad daylight and it wasn't a sun flare
[01:38:34.160 --> 01:38:39.280]  because he showed me video no and I could see it from behind the tree so it
[01:38:39.280 --> 01:38:43.360]  wasn't it wasn't a sun flare but that could be anything I mean that could be
[01:38:43.360 --> 01:38:49.200]  a satellite who knows correct but we have I have and most of them are on my
[01:38:49.200 --> 01:38:53.720]  my new my new video I'm hoping to get the darn thing out I don't even know if
[01:38:53.720 --> 01:38:57.080]  it'll get out that's how much trouble they've had the bottom line is we have
[01:38:57.080 --> 01:39:04.160]  pictures of it particularly stuff taken from the southern Antarctica and the
[01:39:04.160 --> 01:39:07.400]  weather center down there they've got pictures from down there there's
[01:39:07.400 --> 01:39:12.640]  pictures from all over the world progressively etc etc there's no
[01:39:12.640 --> 01:39:19.080]  question about that Google space about one year ago when it was posted out by
[01:39:19.080 --> 01:39:24.800]  somebody that was an astronomer said go to this on Google Google space and you
[01:39:24.800 --> 01:39:29.640]  can find it the following day they literally blacked it out the size of a
[01:39:29.640 --> 01:39:33.680]  postcard so that you couldn't even see it they actually intentionally
[01:39:33.680 --> 01:39:39.280]  eliminated it from people being able to see it no it exists period I have to go
[01:39:39.280 --> 01:39:47.680]  on with this miss the lady that's been in charge of the Homeland Security for
[01:39:47.680 --> 01:39:52.200]  so long all right she just quit a little while back
[01:39:52.200 --> 01:39:57.160]  but you know what's her name on Napoleano Jenna Napoleano she said the
[01:39:57.160 --> 01:40:02.880]  same thing that Woolsey said that it is absolutely positive we are going to get
[01:40:02.880 --> 01:40:09.760]  solar flares that will potentially shut down every single electronic device on
[01:40:09.760 --> 01:40:16.440]  on either the entire earth or half of the earth the other gentlemen that they
[01:40:16.440 --> 01:40:22.400]  used to be in charge of the that what they call that psychic thing with the
[01:40:22.400 --> 01:40:29.760]  CIA for so long the viewers his name was Major Ed Dames he came out and said the
[01:40:29.760 --> 01:40:34.440]  same thing that they had projected that in fact we were going to get these
[01:40:34.440 --> 01:40:42.360]  solar flares now the flares are ahead of the possibility of Nibiru coming close
[01:40:42.360 --> 01:40:47.480]  if the solar flares hit us when everybody understand this if we get a
[01:40:47.480 --> 01:40:54.920]  solar flare equal to one that we already got in 1895 when we didn't have a lot
[01:40:54.920 --> 01:41:02.280]  of electricity if we get a solar flare today it'll put every single mechanism on
[01:41:02.280 --> 01:41:08.800]  earth null and void we will not have any communication we will have no lights we
[01:41:08.800 --> 01:41:13.440]  will have no food sources we'll have no fuel no method of delivery well let me
[01:41:13.440 --> 01:41:18.120]  say this it may not be it may not be this giant gas giant or this imploded
[01:41:18.120 --> 01:41:23.440]  Sun as people have surmised this planet X or Nibiru is that the ancients called it
[01:41:23.440 --> 01:41:28.920]  but here's how they can post science Comet Eisen 2013 may be among brightest
[01:41:28.920 --> 01:41:33.640]  ever seen astronomers say and they go on to say that its tail may hit us but it's
[01:41:33.640 --> 01:41:38.160]  nothing to worry about I do know they've been in the news saying they believe
[01:41:38.160 --> 01:41:41.600]  there's a hundred plus year cycle and that and that it will fry all our
[01:41:41.600 --> 01:41:44.440]  communications now I don't know that's government fair monitoring but you're
[01:41:44.440 --> 01:41:48.800]  right Napolitano has come out and said that are you saying they're trying to
[01:41:48.800 --> 01:41:53.640]  get people ready for something well here's the bottom line again they set
[01:41:53.640 --> 01:41:58.640]  themselves up like I said they've taken every single dollar they could humanly
[01:41:58.640 --> 01:42:03.760]  take they are either hiding some of the goals for later potential use
[01:42:03.760 --> 01:42:08.920]  underground they're building the undergrounds to hide out for the limited
[01:42:08.920 --> 01:42:17.920]  few now what they're going to do is they have to have martial law before this
[01:42:17.920 --> 01:42:22.120]  hits the fan before it looks like we're going to be completely
[01:42:22.120 --> 01:42:28.120]  electronically shut down and also before it's the possibility of this huge
[01:42:28.120 --> 01:42:34.120]  planet swinging close by once more which it theoretically does every three
[01:42:34.120 --> 01:42:41.240]  thousand years now they have to have some excuse so some of the junk that we're
[01:42:41.240 --> 01:42:48.680]  seeing going on the crazy radical challenging Syria and pushing North
[01:42:48.680 --> 01:42:53.680]  Korea and all these other things that potentially any one of which they can
[01:42:53.680 --> 01:43:00.640]  cultivate far enough along to where they can declare martial law and it has to be
[01:43:00.640 --> 01:43:07.120]  done before the proof hits the planet hits the fan okay it has to be done now
[01:43:07.120 --> 01:43:13.040]  they would not be doing all of this they've interrupted an awful lot of what
[01:43:13.040 --> 01:43:18.240]  we would call the New World Order movement they've interrupted an awful
[01:43:18.240 --> 01:43:23.400]  lot all of a sudden and gotten very seriously with going underground and
[01:43:23.400 --> 01:43:29.520]  stealing the money alright they wouldn't do that if they weren't absolutely
[01:43:29.520 --> 01:43:35.720]  positive that the planet was going to hit the fan now I have unbelievable
[01:43:35.720 --> 01:43:41.920]  scientific backup on this planet Planet X not only do we have great
[01:43:41.920 --> 01:43:47.640]  photographs of it now now that we have the equipment to do it pretty good which
[01:43:47.640 --> 01:43:53.480]  even includes some what we would call amateur astronomers but we have
[01:43:53.480 --> 01:44:01.320]  statements etc and going way way back and corresponding information but here's
[01:44:01.320 --> 01:44:05.520]  one again there's something that I discovered just because I got into this
[01:44:05.520 --> 01:44:11.240]  thing and and was wondering if this was really possible the planets in our
[01:44:11.240 --> 01:44:19.760]  entire solar system have started heating up temperature increases and their
[01:44:19.760 --> 01:44:26.680]  orbits are wiggling they are being affected from Pluto out in other words
[01:44:26.680 --> 01:44:31.880]  excuse me from Pluto coming inwards but they're heating up from Pluto coming
[01:44:31.880 --> 01:44:38.120]  inwards they are not being heated up by the Sun and this is a scientific fact
[01:44:38.120 --> 01:44:44.840]  it's been going on all of the surface the surface atmosphere the chemical
[01:44:44.840 --> 01:44:50.880]  structure and the heat the temperature of all of our planets started a year or
[01:44:50.880 --> 01:44:58.880]  so ago going up and started being affected by some body out there beyond
[01:44:58.880 --> 01:45:03.800]  Pluto and that is exactly what we're talking about we're talking about in a
[01:45:03.800 --> 01:45:10.440]  biru and we're talking about something that swings through here every 3600
[01:45:10.440 --> 01:45:16.280]  years and when it comes close to the earth it's gonna clean it off like like
[01:45:16.280 --> 01:45:23.880]  Noah's flood because that was one of the passes of Nibiru that was Noah's
[01:45:23.880 --> 01:45:29.440]  floods and it's going to do a number and it'll do a number on us ahead of
[01:45:29.440 --> 01:45:34.400]  actually being close enough to physically do it with its gravity and when do
[01:45:34.400 --> 01:45:39.920]  you think this is going to happen sometime beginning yesterday and
[01:45:39.920 --> 01:45:48.280]  probably the first of next year I don't think according to the to the ancient
[01:45:48.280 --> 01:45:54.160]  writings on that from the Himalayas from the the monks up on the top of the
[01:45:54.160 --> 01:46:00.960]  hills in the Himalayas they sought talked about 2015 I'm saying sometime
[01:46:00.960 --> 01:46:07.880]  between and a reason I say yesterday because five days ago was the some of
[01:46:07.880 --> 01:46:13.600]  the contracts that the cut the government had put out for example for 2700
[01:46:13.600 --> 01:46:19.760]  riot-controlled trucks and Jeep tanks 2700 of them were to be finished and
[01:46:19.760 --> 01:46:25.200]  delivered five days ago I'm assuming that they have been so bite see had to
[01:46:25.200 --> 01:46:31.080]  go I'm taking schedules of a multitude of directions here not only ancient
[01:46:31.080 --> 01:46:36.480]  writings but modern science well Bob government's contract very interesting
[01:46:36.480 --> 01:46:39.600]  we'll have to talk to you when that film comes out we'll talk again soon Bob
[01:46:39.600 --> 01:46:44.720]  pleasure investigations calm thank you Bob thank you folks I like Bob and he
[01:46:44.720 --> 01:46:49.960]  put out a lot of good info on Iran Contra he's everything he's talking about
[01:46:49.960 --> 01:46:53.000]  we pulled up the article where nine trillion missing from the Federal
[01:46:53.000 --> 01:46:58.840]  Reserve you know Newsmax with her testimony in fact I was reminded that by
[01:46:58.840 --> 01:47:02.880]  him and 99% of what he's saying I can document then he goes off into this
[01:47:02.880 --> 01:47:08.120]  stuff and I believe him I believe he was told this is coming a lot of what he
[01:47:08.120 --> 01:47:14.000]  said I've separately seen even in mainline news that the CIA's been worried
[01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:19.160]  about this and I believe this is used as a cover though for the whole COG program
[01:47:19.160 --> 01:47:23.440]  and they use the threat of solar flares that's real and the threat of
[01:47:23.440 --> 01:47:28.840]  comets hitting us that are real you've got all these cases in Russia 100 years
[01:47:28.840 --> 01:47:33.280]  ago and others were thousands of square miles of stuff gets devastated thank God
[01:47:33.280 --> 01:47:38.560]  nobody was up there in Siberia when it happened or very few people I don't
[01:47:38.560 --> 01:47:42.480]  discount these things happen all the time asteroids come close to the earth all
[01:47:42.480 --> 01:47:46.280]  the time comets come close it's been proven now that they have telescopes
[01:47:46.280 --> 01:47:51.000]  that stuff's getting ahead all the time look at the moon you know they said oh
[01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:53.760]  that happened over four billion years and now they're like actually we think the
[01:47:53.760 --> 01:47:58.720]  whole face of it might change every hundred million the truth is they don't
[01:47:58.720 --> 01:48:05.040]  know they don't know we don't know and it is sensational I could write a book on
[01:48:05.040 --> 01:48:08.680]  Planet X probably sell a million copies of it and all my problems would be solved
[01:48:08.680 --> 01:48:13.400]  I could fund my news operation but that's not how I'm gonna do it I spent so
[01:48:13.400 --> 01:48:17.160]  much time trying to fund the radio show the filmmaking the writers the the
[01:48:17.160 --> 01:48:22.920]  research trying to be credible and then there's just it's so fantastical what's
[01:48:22.920 --> 01:48:28.680]  going on who knows what to believe anymore but we'll we'll get Bob back up
[01:48:28.680 --> 01:48:31.600]  to talk more about that I wanted to get Bob up about his take almost happening
[01:48:31.600 --> 01:48:37.920]  the Middle East Syria all that but you know Bob's now gone off into this and
[01:48:37.920 --> 01:48:41.680]  he was the first guy I ever heard talk about was specifics of harp and weather
[01:48:41.680 --> 01:48:46.320]  manipulation and chemtrails in like 1993 he was putting out videos on it and
[01:48:46.320 --> 01:48:51.360]  then I thought this guy's crazy I remember the first time I saw Bob on on
[01:48:51.360 --> 01:48:56.920]  like access television like 1993 I was right out of high school had moved out
[01:48:56.920 --> 01:49:00.920]  was in college and remember seeing this guy given reports from where he was in
[01:49:00.920 --> 01:49:04.240]  Idaho or something and it was just a video and him talking with charts and
[01:49:04.240 --> 01:49:08.680]  stuff about how they did it in the towers and who his witnesses were and
[01:49:08.680 --> 01:49:12.440]  when it was developed and all of that turned out to be accurate so I'll tell
[01:49:12.440 --> 01:49:17.080]  you it really freaks me out when he's on there saying stuff like that but I just
[01:49:17.080 --> 01:49:21.960]  I don't have any amateur astronomers there are folks because I've been one
[01:49:21.960 --> 01:49:29.760]  myself it's mainly amateur astronomers that end up finding things it is it is
[01:49:29.760 --> 01:49:34.800]  it is amateur astronomers that find most the new comments that find most of the
[01:49:34.800 --> 01:49:40.600]  new asteroids so if there was some big gas giant that was going to be coming
[01:49:40.600 --> 01:49:45.760]  out from an elliptical orbit to hit the earth or come close to the earth you
[01:49:45.760 --> 01:49:50.760]  would see it you would know about it they cannot hide this stuff anymore so
[01:49:50.760 --> 01:49:57.480]  I've got to say that I disagree with Bob overall in the final equation that
[01:49:57.480 --> 01:50:02.160]  Planet X is real and people have got really mad at me the last three times
[01:50:02.160 --> 01:50:07.040]  it was supposed to kill us and I get if there's ancient you know stories of this
[01:50:07.040 --> 01:50:10.760]  in all cultures I know things hit the earth I'm not debating that there's a
[01:50:10.760 --> 01:50:15.800]  bunch of planetoids out there red dwarfs will black dwarfs will imploded
[01:50:15.800 --> 01:50:23.080]  Suns whatever I'm not debating that that could exist I'm saying this whole COG
[01:50:23.080 --> 01:50:27.840]  is about worldwide financial meltdown and World War three with Russia those
[01:50:27.840 --> 01:50:32.720]  11 Russian ships missile cruisers in the Mediterranean are real our ships masked
[01:50:32.720 --> 01:50:36.200]  are real the Joint Chiefs blocking Obama from trying to start a big war
[01:50:36.200 --> 01:50:42.760]  that's real Saudi Arabia funding al Qaeda all over the world Israel supporting
[01:50:42.760 --> 01:50:47.880]  it just unbelievable that's real this is all real and I'm gonna stick to what's
[01:50:47.880 --> 01:50:52.400]  real I don't blame people speculating and I hope Bob turns out being wrong
[01:50:52.400 --> 01:50:57.880]  to I think he's a good guy though we'll be right back
[01:51:00.320 --> 01:51:04.640]  attention home schoolers teachers and students of all ages now there's a way
[01:51:04.640 --> 01:51:08.680]  to learning this grammar using the Holy Bible sacred grammar is a unique book
[01:51:08.680 --> 01:51:12.040]  that teaches all of the fundamentals of English grammar using Bible verses
[01:51:12.040 --> 01:51:16.200]  affordable and simple to use it's a superb supplement and a great teacher's

[01:53:13.360 --> 01:53:17.240]  they probably know that revealing it on TV will generate mass hysteria and
[01:53:17.240 --> 01:53:21.760]  chaos but I believe you should be informed about it because when the
[01:53:21.760 --> 01:53:26.600]  sinister agenda is finally accomplished and everything unravels only those who

[01:54:10.040 --> 01:54:18.120]  radio network here's what the Huffington Post has to say on a comment
[01:54:18.120 --> 01:54:27.120]  icing they quote astronomers from the Smithsonian astrophysical observation
[01:54:27.120 --> 01:54:31.560]  board that integrates all these different governmental and institutional
[01:54:31.560 --> 01:54:37.240]  telescopes saying that this this this will be grazing Lee close means coming
[01:54:37.240 --> 01:54:42.560]  very close and dazzling bright and then it has the question mark they debate
[01:54:42.560 --> 01:54:50.080]  whether it'll be the brightest ever or among the brightest ever and it gets
[01:54:50.080 --> 01:54:55.480]  into when it is going to be arriving and I hope there's no hellbott people that
[01:54:55.480 --> 01:54:59.080]  go and commit suicide over this I mean the ancients were fascinated with the
[01:54:59.080 --> 01:55:05.560]  heavens I don't blame them but again I don't think that we can put a date on
[01:55:05.560 --> 01:55:10.920]  when something's gonna slam into the earth and government is digging in
[01:55:10.920 --> 01:55:14.400]  that's true and the training is they're saying the American people are their
[01:55:14.400 --> 01:55:19.520]  enemy so it looks like governments are gearing in for a depopulation event
[01:55:19.520 --> 01:55:24.040]  perhaps a bio weapon will be released I mean you've got all these top globalists
[01:55:24.040 --> 01:55:28.400]  in the news every day saying call the human population down to almost nothing
[01:55:28.400 --> 01:55:36.480]  we're a plague we're horrible we're bad attenborough came out a few days ago and
[01:55:36.480 --> 01:55:42.280]  said the same thing so that's the real threat is the crazy humans on the
[01:55:42.280 --> 01:55:46.920]  planet that have the super weapons we know they're real we know their views
[01:55:46.920 --> 01:55:50.440]  we know what they're planning the question is when and if they've got
[01:55:50.440 --> 01:55:56.240]  enough underground bases and enough COG they may actually try it now ladies and

[02:01:47.960 --> 02:01:55.320]  some of the news up on info wars.com and mirrored over at prisonplanet.com and
[02:01:55.320 --> 02:01:59.920]  then I have news stories like this one right here
[02:01:59.920 --> 02:02:10.160]  farmer DPS detained then released illegal immigrants and this is just
[02:02:10.160 --> 02:02:14.320]  standard this is out of the Brownsville Herald when you trespass on
[02:02:14.320 --> 02:02:18.520]  somebody's property if you're an American citizen regardless of what color
[02:02:18.520 --> 02:02:22.000]  you are and if they catch you and call the police and it shows you're doing
[02:02:22.000 --> 02:02:25.040]  something on their property they shouldn't be you get charged with
[02:02:25.040 --> 02:02:29.480]  trespassing even if you're not proven to be doing something but when it's
[02:02:29.480 --> 02:02:34.760]  illegal aliens this happened all over the country on your property even moving
[02:02:34.760 --> 02:02:38.400]  into your barn whatever the police will not arrest them in most cases because
[02:02:38.400 --> 02:02:42.600]  the feds will not pick them up and the illegals are smart they'll just sit in
[02:02:42.600 --> 02:02:48.960]  jail and never post bonds so they just let them go but Americans grovel of the
[02:02:48.960 --> 02:02:55.040]  system work with it we think it's a thing of pride to to bend over and grab
[02:02:55.040 --> 02:03:01.680]  our ankles and I mean literally for the DPS I mean the DPS deep the illegals are
[02:03:01.680 --> 02:03:05.560]  drunk they're allowed to go free here in Texas that's on record come out in the
[02:03:05.560 --> 02:03:10.080]  news and again it just shows the illegal aliens we could actually learn a lot
[02:03:10.080 --> 02:03:15.200]  from them I mean it's time to just stop complying with basically everything
[02:03:15.200 --> 02:03:18.360]  because the government's already stolen everything they've already stolen all
[02:03:18.360 --> 02:03:21.680]  the pensions it's all gone folks they usually to get ready and get yourself
[02:03:21.680 --> 02:03:25.600]  prepared you go get a college degree you're probably never gonna be able to
[02:03:25.600 --> 02:03:30.280]  use it for anything I mean this is this is this serious and I'll tell you the
[02:03:30.280 --> 02:03:36.680]  real end of civilization folks is the end of the industrial civilization under
[02:03:36.680 --> 02:03:42.880]  agenda 21 that's the real end is this slow creeping death that is just
[02:03:42.880 --> 02:03:45.280]  destroying our society I'm going to briefly talk about that when we come
[02:03:45.280 --> 02:03:48.400]  back from break and then go to our guests but Texas Department of Public
[02:03:48.400 --> 02:03:54.840]  Safety troopers briefly detained and then released about 20 people suspected of
[02:03:54.840 --> 02:03:58.200]  being in the country illegally Saturday but it doesn't matter they don't have to
[02:03:58.200 --> 02:04:02.920]  show their IDs only citizens do morning on a farmers land 24 miles north of
[02:04:02.920 --> 02:04:09.160]  central mission that's way inside the US the landowner said about 8 a.m. Saturday
[02:04:09.160 --> 02:04:12.520]  Lee Adams said he noticed a lot of activity in the brush on his large
[02:04:12.520 --> 02:04:16.520]  rural property he called DPS trooper who called for backup group of troopers
[02:04:16.520 --> 02:04:20.600]  which included five cars and two helicopters eventually rounded up a
[02:04:20.600 --> 02:04:24.680]  large group of people where appeared to be possibly in the country illegally Adam
[02:04:24.680 --> 02:04:28.400]  said unless they're an hour the cars and helicopters scattered allowing the
[02:04:28.400 --> 02:04:33.000]  people they detained to do the same yeah this has really happened in Arizona
[02:04:33.000 --> 02:04:36.080]  where the illegals will actually move into your property then into your barn
[02:04:36.080 --> 02:04:38.880]  and then if you give them problems they'll burn everything down that's been
[02:04:38.880 --> 02:04:47.600]  a big problem so it's just it's unbelievable the DPS I'm surprised
[02:04:47.600 --> 02:04:51.280]  didn't arrest the landowner or do a proctology exam on him to make sure
[02:04:51.280 --> 02:04:55.680]  there wasn't a hand grenade up there that's what they do to your wife so get

[02:08:40.840 --> 02:08:44.880]  third hour don't forget we have in fours nightly news coming up tonight
[02:08:44.880 --> 02:08:49.640]  seven o'clock central for people that are watching at prison planet dot TV we
[02:08:49.640 --> 02:08:53.600]  are fighting the construction of the prison planet with info wars dot com
[02:08:53.600 --> 02:08:59.080]  and prison planet dot TV I wanted to hit a couple pieces of news here
[02:08:59.080 --> 02:09:05.480]  everyone's freaking out over Obamacare as Forbes reports Obamacare will
[02:09:05.480 --> 02:09:13.960]  increase health spending by $7,450 for a family of four and that's
[02:09:13.960 --> 02:09:18.800]  conservative numbers New York Times probe finds new law may limit choices
[02:09:18.800 --> 02:09:23.760]  after all yeah that's what they said the plan was movement grows to repeal
[02:09:23.760 --> 02:09:28.440]  Obamacare exemption for Congress we have the article up on info wars dot com of
[02:09:28.440 --> 02:09:34.440]  Rand Paul saying he's gonna introduce the legislation to do it you know saying
[02:09:34.440 --> 02:09:38.320]  could they be that out of touch those stories are up at rug report dot com and
[02:09:38.320 --> 02:09:46.760]  up on info wars dot com so this is the type of garbage that we are dealing
[02:09:46.760 --> 02:09:53.000]  with doctors are bracing for surge of ailing patients frustration is
[02:09:53.000 --> 02:09:58.920]  mounting and again the plan is bankrupt the country make you dependent or even
[02:09:58.920 --> 02:10:02.400]  if you have money you can't get real health care that's how it is in other
[02:10:02.400 --> 02:10:09.280]  countries and when you see how gullible people are when they find out what a
[02:10:09.280 --> 02:10:14.560]  screw job this is they're gonna get very very angry but don't worry they'll have
[02:10:14.560 --> 02:10:20.120]  us in a major war by then as a political distraction this is very very serious
[02:10:20.120 --> 02:10:26.280]  situation now before we go any further and go to our guest we mentioned this
[02:10:26.280 --> 02:10:31.280]  earlier so I thought why not show you Elizabeth Coleman is the inspector
[02:10:31.280 --> 02:10:40.840]  general of the supposed Federal Reserve and whenever she was talking last year
[02:10:40.840 --> 02:10:45.920]  the congressman Grayson he wanted to know where nine billion excuse me nine
[02:10:45.920 --> 02:10:50.400]  trillion excuse me dollars went and she said oh I don't know about that
[02:10:50.400 --> 02:10:55.360]  Bloomberg article but then later you know it came out they said well we don't
[02:10:55.360 --> 02:10:59.520]  know where it went and then later it was in subsequent hearings well we do know
[02:10:59.520 --> 02:11:03.640]  but we can't tell you and won't tell you see Congress isn't even allowed to know
[02:11:03.640 --> 02:11:08.280]  we're being robbed folks that's what Homeland Security's there to do to make
[02:11:08.280 --> 02:11:11.400]  sure we never try to get control of our government again they're the bank robber
[02:11:11.400 --> 02:11:15.400]  that comes in and aims the gun at the people while the other bank robbers go
[02:11:15.400 --> 02:11:21.080]  in the back and unload the vault and that isn't some analogy or allegory or
[02:11:21.080 --> 02:11:26.760]  parable the globalists have decided to go all out ladies and gentlemen they
[02:11:26.760 --> 02:11:30.840]  decided to go all out so we did dig up the clip here is that clip since we
[02:11:30.840 --> 02:11:35.040]  mentioned it because I know it sounds unbelievable just like AP reported on
[02:11:35.040 --> 02:11:39.740]  2.2 trillion missing and that was over a decade ago now it's over 4 trillion
[02:11:39.740 --> 02:11:43.440]  missing the pension funds everything now you're still being paid out but it's I
[02:11:43.440 --> 02:11:47.880]  oh use it's just digital all the real wealth was taken and leveraged down it's
[02:11:47.880 --> 02:11:52.080]  all gone and I don't know what the establishment thinks they're gonna do are
[02:11:52.080 --> 02:11:55.560]  they gonna release a bio weapon and that you know that wipes out the majority of
[02:11:55.560 --> 02:11:59.240]  the earth's population while they hide in armored bunkers because they've sure
[02:11:59.240 --> 02:12:03.960]  been building them and I think that's what the bunkers are for not for some
[02:12:03.960 --> 02:12:08.160]  comet hitting the earth everybody always speculates we know the tyrants are
[02:12:08.160 --> 02:12:14.280]  training for war against the people we know that they're eugenicists folks
[02:12:14.280 --> 02:12:18.800]  here's the thing the singularity is gonna hit information first Google has
[02:12:18.800 --> 02:12:25.840]  said they want to be the mind of God talk about a power trip Google is the
[02:12:25.840 --> 02:12:30.640]  NSA it's come out Google is getting all the data on you to find out who you are
[02:12:30.640 --> 02:12:34.440]  to manipulate you and so is Microsoft they're all part of the same combine
[02:12:34.440 --> 02:12:39.320]  these people are not Germans they're not Jewish they're not Chinese they're not
[02:12:39.320 --> 02:12:44.840]  Mexican they're not they're not African they're all those groups what they are
[02:12:44.840 --> 02:12:50.520]  is eugenicist you don't get into their club unless you believe everybody scum
[02:12:50.520 --> 02:12:53.680]  and the population needs to be reduced and I was thinking this morning I had
[02:12:53.680 --> 02:12:56.480]  this epiphany we're gonna play the clip and go to our guests and do overdrive if
[02:12:56.480 --> 02:13:01.120]  need me whether she's got a lot of key information I want to get this out here
[02:13:01.120 --> 02:13:06.360]  because I had this epiphany and I was thinking why do they fund making people
[02:13:06.360 --> 02:13:13.200]  dumb down and lazy while at the same time setting up eugenics and and telling
[02:13:13.200 --> 02:13:17.880]  the wealthy and the hard-working see the lazy public the lazy people you we need
[02:13:17.880 --> 02:13:22.160]  to get rid of them we need to sterilize them well I knew that it was a dichotomy
[02:13:22.160 --> 02:13:26.840]  and a dialectic of of of controlling both sides that's the master plan and
[02:13:26.840 --> 02:13:30.720]  everything the globalists do that's their wavelength their signature but it
[02:13:30.720 --> 02:13:34.800]  hit me they're going to suck everything out of the middle class and everything
[02:13:34.800 --> 02:13:39.360]  out of the wealthy that aren't part of the elite and transfer it to destroy any
[02:13:39.360 --> 02:13:45.440]  political opposition to the unwashed masses who they have helped dumb down
[02:13:45.440 --> 02:13:49.000]  and grease the skids and people don't need help being dumbed down and becoming
[02:13:49.000 --> 02:13:54.000]  decadent the humans do it every time we become prosperous but the globalist are
[02:13:54.000 --> 02:14:02.760]  trying to supercharge it like hurrying it up so that a large core of the
[02:14:02.760 --> 02:14:07.800]  subal e maybe five to percent of the population will actually aid the
[02:14:07.800 --> 02:14:13.880]  globalists when it comes time to kill everybody I mean I already talked to
[02:14:13.880 --> 02:14:17.160]  intelligency and they go well there are too many poor people I mean I've been
[02:14:17.160 --> 02:14:23.000]  in multiple meetings before out in Wemberley and and out at the lake at
[02:14:23.000 --> 02:14:26.160]  wealthy people's houses at parties back when I have time to go to things like
[02:14:26.160 --> 02:14:31.000]  that and it's always the cocktail talk well yes you know that that is true and
[02:14:31.000 --> 02:14:34.920]  I'm a microbiologist and we are discussing it's it's well known when do
[02:14:34.920 --> 02:14:39.000]  we get rid of the disease that's humanity and and I don't want to be part
[02:14:39.000 --> 02:14:43.800]  of this but I know if I don't go along with it my family will be next and plus
[02:14:43.800 --> 02:14:47.720]  we've not even been given entree into how to get into the elite but this is
[02:14:47.720 --> 02:14:52.000]  just admitted by the higher ups and this is academics this is people at
[02:14:52.000 --> 02:14:57.160]  companies and of course they make these statements publicly too and then other
[02:14:57.160 --> 02:15:01.400]  people are just dug in out in the countryside former weapons biologist you
[02:15:01.400 --> 02:15:05.360]  name it you know just working at local clinics and stuff because they know what's
[02:15:05.360 --> 02:15:14.160]  going on from the inside folks this is not a game this is not a game and is it
[02:15:14.160 --> 02:15:16.720]  nuclear war they're planning to have is it gonna be a bio weapons release
[02:15:16.720 --> 02:15:21.400]  they're always calling for most of you out there I don't care if you're worth
[02:15:21.400 --> 02:15:27.160]  a hundred million dollars I don't care if you're worth a billion dollars last
[02:15:27.160 --> 02:15:37.560]  night I was having dinner with you know very famous brand a producer food food
[02:15:37.560 --> 02:15:42.760]  manufacturing owner household names if I said him and he was completely freaked
[02:15:42.760 --> 02:15:46.760]  out he said yeah no the whole system is imploding and the elite on top are
[02:15:46.760 --> 02:15:50.560]  robbing everything he said you're absolutely right that's what's going on
[02:15:50.560 --> 02:15:55.600]  as if there's not going to be any future I mean when you're sitting around with a
[02:15:55.600 --> 02:15:58.840]  guy that's worth you know five hundred million dollars a billion dollars a
[02:15:58.840 --> 02:16:02.120]  hundred million dollars and they're all going you're exactly right and that's
[02:16:02.120 --> 02:16:05.960]  the plan and that's what they're saying and these people are freaked out ladies
[02:16:05.960 --> 02:16:13.240]  and gentlemen I'm telling you it's like the devil runs things or something and
[02:16:13.240 --> 02:16:18.480]  nobody's safe not cops not military not CIA not people with a billion dollars
[02:16:18.480 --> 02:16:22.680]  folks this is madness that's being set up let's go to this clip and we'll go to
[02:16:22.680 --> 02:16:26.360]  our guest Melissa overdrive so she's almost a full hour this is very important
[02:16:26.360 --> 02:16:30.160]  one of the best speakers I've heard and when I hear her get into these facts it
[02:16:30.160 --> 02:16:32.800]  scares me because everything she's saying I've already got government
[02:16:32.800 --> 02:16:36.840]  documents on and no she's accurate and it's just mind-blowing we're going to
[02:16:36.840 --> 02:16:40.960]  talk to Deborah here in just a moment Deborah Tavares but first here's this
[02:16:40.960 --> 02:16:52.800]  clip with the inspector general here it is I've never heard that do that before
[02:16:52.800 --> 02:16:58.280]  well let's hit pause let's hit pause when I saw it played on the computer out
[02:16:58.280 --> 02:17:03.800]  there it worked great so let's just let's download the clip again we know
[02:17:03.800 --> 02:17:07.720]  where to play it from we can go through check sequencing and then we can play it
[02:17:07.720 --> 02:17:11.560]  on air because we're going to go to this one where the other or I'll have the
[02:17:11.560 --> 02:17:17.500]  guys reposted up on info wars.com that's not like Cylon Raiders or something
[02:17:17.500 --> 02:17:23.400]  going on there but we're gonna get you that clip and we're going to play it
[02:17:23.400 --> 02:17:27.000]  on air in fact you can have the guys download it over there and send it to
[02:17:27.000 --> 02:17:31.600]  if you want if there's an issue do we have any idea what's going on with it
[02:17:31.600 --> 02:17:39.800]  I can't be in the Congress audio I went out there and I listened to it this is
[02:17:39.800 --> 02:17:44.320]  kind of fun let's just troubleshoot this on air like we visited you're saying
[02:17:44.320 --> 02:17:53.160]  it isn't a clip because something's amplifying it then because because well
[02:17:53.160 --> 02:17:58.640]  when I heard it out there guys it didn't sound like that so that may just be
[02:17:58.640 --> 02:18:04.160]  some kind of amplifying going through our system now it's fine let's search the
[02:18:04.160 --> 02:18:08.480]  headline and try to find it from another or give it to the audio guys to try to
[02:18:08.480 --> 02:18:13.680]  clean it up because that's what I want to do very important clip you can just
[02:18:13.680 --> 02:18:18.260]  search it and find it the Federal Reserve cannot account for nine trillion
[02:18:18.260 --> 02:18:24.120]  in off-balance sheet transactions zero hedge reported on it so did Bloomberg we
[02:18:24.120 --> 02:18:30.000]  reported on it as well this is old news but I just don't like I just don't like
[02:18:30.000 --> 02:18:37.560]  to mention something like that without actually playing you the clip on air
[02:18:37.560 --> 02:18:42.600]  we're gonna go to break and come back with our guest Deborah Tavares
[02:18:42.600 --> 02:18:47.880]  Tavares and you can go to her website stopthecrime.net where she
[02:18:47.880 --> 02:18:52.480]  breaks down has the government documents silent weapons for quiet wars info on
[02:18:52.480 --> 02:18:59.440]  soft kill weapons you name it it is all right there on that site so when we come
[02:18:59.440 --> 02:19:05.200]  back we will we will go to her on that front but again if you go to info wars
[02:19:05.200 --> 02:19:09.600]  dot com very important article to get out to everybody you know to point out
[02:19:09.600 --> 02:19:14.720]  the hypocrisy all of us have to fight Obamacare eugenics care globalist care
[02:19:14.720 --> 02:19:19.920]  everywhere we are Rand Paul to introduce amendment outlawing Obamacare
[02:19:19.920 --> 02:19:25.920]  exemptions for government employees and that's how you counter this see we all
[02:19:25.920 --> 02:19:28.920]  think of civil rights as black people and white people fighting with each other
[02:19:28.920 --> 02:19:33.560]  that's what civil rights means now is hyping racial division on MSNBC the
[02:19:33.560 --> 02:19:39.120]  truth is we're all being cheated and the and the elite UN globalist types and the
[02:19:39.120 --> 02:19:42.240]  congressional and parliamentary types they're all above the law they're all
[02:19:42.240 --> 02:19:47.920]  exempt from everything they're exempt from most taxes most regulations the
[02:19:47.920 --> 02:19:51.360]  police are exempt from wisest plate reading cameras and public records

[02:24:44.840 --> 02:24:50.560]  meter individuals out there period and she's extremely articulate we're gonna
[02:24:50.560 --> 02:24:53.600]  do a little bit of overdrive with her into the next hour to make sure she has
[02:24:53.600 --> 02:24:58.600]  time to break everything down today and I again appreciate her coming on every
[02:24:58.600 --> 02:25:04.960]  time I hear her on the radio it's just amazing to listen to I heard her on
[02:25:04.960 --> 02:25:10.600]  Joyce Rowley show last week here locally on the local FM that also carries our
[02:25:10.600 --> 02:25:16.160]  show and I thought man I've had her on before I've got to get her back on with
[02:25:16.160 --> 02:25:20.160]  the latest shooting and the guy saying he was under ELF whether he was under it
[02:25:20.160 --> 02:25:26.160]  or not it exists it's been declassified they've got microwave systems you know in
[02:25:26.160 --> 02:25:31.000]  Times Square that broadcast sound into your head in fact the headline on that
[02:25:31.000 --> 02:25:34.600]  from Huffington Post I think was schizophrenia the new advertising
[02:25:34.600 --> 02:25:40.000]  campaign and the point is is that separate from all that the smart meters
[02:25:40.000 --> 02:25:45.400]  the spy grids the cell phone spying on you what the studies show this microwave
[02:25:45.400 --> 02:25:49.800]  radiation is doing to plants and animals she joins us so give us an overview of
[02:25:49.800 --> 02:25:54.440]  your research the history of this and and and what these globalists are up to
[02:25:54.440 --> 02:25:58.080]  that have captured our government and then in the next long segment I want to
[02:25:58.080 --> 02:26:02.560]  get into the whole raft of issues that you sent us smart meters hidden
[02:26:02.560 --> 02:26:08.240]  implementation tactics silent weapons NASA warfare and all the documents that
[02:26:08.240 --> 02:26:12.600]  are at stopthecrime.net Deborah thank you for coming on with us well Alex thank
[02:26:12.600 --> 02:26:16.520]  you so much for having me on I want to get started by giving everyone the
[02:26:16.520 --> 02:26:21.360]  opportunity to print get if they cannot download copies of the documents they're
[02:26:21.360 --> 02:26:25.000]  going to hear me speak about I want them to be able to get them and they can
[02:26:25.000 --> 02:26:37.040]  call our print shop at area code 707-586-9558-707-586-9558 we will print
[02:26:37.040 --> 02:26:40.160]  those at print cost and shipping and get these out to you because it's
[02:26:40.160 --> 02:26:43.720]  absolutely imperative Alex that everybody gets this information in their
[02:26:43.720 --> 02:26:48.520]  hands immediately and most importantly I think to start as a bit of a
[02:26:48.520 --> 02:26:54.000]  foundation is the silent weapons for quiet wars document that's only a 44
[02:26:54.000 --> 02:26:59.240]  page document we have it on our website both in a free download or also up where
[02:26:59.240 --> 02:27:03.680]  you can listen to it as well and I'm going to start here a bit Alex because
[02:27:03.680 --> 02:27:07.880]  in order to connect the dots of all of the documents that we found on the
[02:27:07.880 --> 02:27:13.120]  government website I think we'll start here first understand that the silent
[02:27:13.120 --> 02:27:17.680]  weapons for quiet wars was a document that was put together in the late 40s
[02:27:17.680 --> 02:27:23.440]  and the groups that were involved in that document at that time were the US
[02:27:23.440 --> 02:27:28.560]  Air Force the Rockefeller International Bankers and Harvard University and this
[02:27:28.560 --> 02:27:34.480]  is an operational technical manual to subvert history and law but total
[02:27:34.480 --> 02:27:40.480]  global manipulation enslavement and genocide and we are the enemy and this
[02:27:40.480 --> 02:27:44.920]  is the thinking of the international bankers and it's important to understand
[02:27:44.920 --> 02:27:49.520]  what they think because this is what they're doing and we can see it we all
[02:27:49.520 --> 02:27:55.280]  know we're under a massive war and it is it's a silent weapons war we're being
[02:27:55.280 --> 02:28:00.400]  subdued and we don't even realize it it is fingerprintless and they are using
[02:28:00.400 --> 02:28:04.680]  chemicals and biological and bacteriological and viruses and parasites
[02:28:04.680 --> 02:28:10.800]  it's fungi carcinogen this we found when we found the NASA war plant on the
[02:28:10.800 --> 02:28:17.000]  NASA website and this document is on our website Alex it is unbeatable it
[02:28:17.000 --> 02:28:21.800]  tells us now this was a PowerPoint presentation back in 2001 given by
[02:28:21.800 --> 02:28:27.520]  Dennis Bushnell the chief NASA scientist to by the way is a transhumanist so the
[02:28:27.520 --> 02:28:32.920]  PowerPoint the topic is about robot cyborgs and humans and they talk about
[02:28:32.920 --> 02:28:39.120]  on page 93 for example how they will torture capture Americans in living
[02:28:39.120 --> 02:28:43.840]  color on prime time and how they will use chemicals and biological on the
[02:28:43.840 --> 02:28:48.040]  continental United States they will attack critical infrastructure and they
[02:28:48.040 --> 02:28:52.920]  will use an EMP electromagnetic pulse which we're hearing a lot in the news
[02:28:52.920 --> 02:28:56.680]  right now they'll do this to us and they'll use radiation microwave
[02:28:56.680 --> 02:29:01.200]  frequencies against our brains and this they say multiple times throughout this
[02:29:01.200 --> 02:29:06.600]  document I would suggest everyone go to stop the crime.net immediately and
[02:29:06.600 --> 02:29:12.600]  understand what is happening and then go to our solutions page because they're
[02:29:12.600 --> 02:29:16.520]  going to hear a lot of horrific things but you've got to take action because
[02:29:16.520 --> 02:29:21.400]  what you've got to understand is in the silent weapons for quiet war document
[02:29:21.400 --> 02:29:27.720]  they tell us the bankers tell us their primary victory is our consent and I
[02:29:27.720 --> 02:29:32.880]  can tell you we are consenting by lack of knowledge you can look this up on page
[02:29:32.880 --> 02:29:37.160]  37 of the quiet weapons document but you've got to understand this is an
[02:29:37.160 --> 02:29:41.920]  artificial consent we're being poisoned we're being coerced. Stay there Debra
[02:29:41.920 --> 02:29:46.080]  Tavares stay there absolutely on target we're gonna explain what soft kill
[02:29:46.080 --> 02:29:51.720]  weapons are and quiet weapons when we come back. We're on the march the

[02:30:00.280 --> 02:30:05.240]  Are we choosing our own destiny or has it been pre-selected for us? As we've
[02:30:05.240 --> 02:30:09.240]  moved through history every great leader has had to understand the potential of
[02:30:09.240 --> 02:30:15.040]  information. Billions of dollars have been spent privately and publicly looking
[02:30:15.040 --> 02:30:20.800]  at how to tap into your psyche. From compulsory state education to the
[02:30:20.800 --> 02:30:25.600]  Hollywood media brainwashing machine we are kept in perpetual bondage to the
[02:30:25.600 --> 02:30:29.600]  ideas that shape our actions. When somebody obscures that feedback loop
[02:30:29.600 --> 02:30:33.440]  between you observing and testing it out and verifying it they can take total
[02:30:33.440 --> 02:30:37.560]  control of your awareness. All of this is happening so fast you need to be ahead of the game.

[02:36:11.400 --> 02:36:15.600]  minutes from now, but some some stay with us into the overdrive for a long time.
[02:36:15.600 --> 02:36:18.480]  I did four hours and quit doing it, so some stations don't care, but I'm back to
[02:36:18.480 --> 02:36:22.720]  doing it just because I can't help it. There's so much to cover. But Debra, I
[02:36:22.720 --> 02:36:27.640]  want to get into silent weapons for quiet wars, but I first want to define
[02:36:27.640 --> 02:36:33.680]  this myself. If Hitler, you know, had his troops in Barbarossa march into Russia
[02:36:33.680 --> 02:36:38.920]  and line up people by the hundreds of thousands monthly and shoot them and
[02:36:38.920 --> 02:36:43.520]  push them into pits, sand pits, the next village would get word and organize a
[02:36:43.520 --> 02:36:48.240]  defense and even if they lost over time with attrition, it defeated the Nazis.
[02:36:48.240 --> 02:36:52.240]  But if the Nazis would have figured out how to come in and be friends and
[02:36:52.240 --> 02:36:56.840]  put a slow-kill weapon in the water that killed himself for five years and
[02:36:56.840 --> 02:37:00.000]  nobody would have known what hit him, and by the time that happened, it had been
[02:37:00.000 --> 02:37:04.360]  over and only the Nazis would have known. Well, it turns out silent weapons for
[02:37:04.360 --> 02:37:07.160]  quiet wars that you're talking about, and we're going to show viewers the
[02:37:07.160 --> 02:37:14.560]  document here. I hold it in my little hand from 1954 to understand all of
[02:37:14.560 --> 02:37:19.120]  this and then understand Colonel Alexander and his soft-kill weapons and
[02:37:19.120 --> 02:37:25.120]  all of it. It is key to understand this is how they're dominating us. We're seen
[02:37:25.120 --> 02:37:29.480]  as a scourge, we're seen as a plague, we must be removed, but they've learned how
[02:37:29.480 --> 02:37:33.640]  to incrementally go after us so that we never understand where the threats
[02:37:33.640 --> 02:37:38.400]  coming from. This is covert silent war, basically, and that's what you're getting
[02:37:38.400 --> 02:37:43.640]  at, and it's paramount, the sodium fluoride, the GMOs, the ultra low
[02:37:43.640 --> 02:37:49.040]  frequency. All of this, DARPA admits is being deployed against the rebellious
[02:37:49.040 --> 02:37:52.680]  Western nations that have always given the globalist their biggest problem.
[02:37:52.680 --> 02:37:56.880]  That's why the military says their number one enemy is the veterans, because
[02:37:56.880 --> 02:37:59.640]  these are people that have been trained by the system who need to be
[02:37:59.640 --> 02:38:05.000]  decommissioned after it's all over. So get into your awakening if you can for
[02:38:05.000 --> 02:38:09.320]  folks and then get into silent weapons for quiet wars and lead into the smart
[02:38:09.320 --> 02:38:14.280]  meters, the grid, the new documents you've discovered, and people again can find
[02:38:14.280 --> 02:38:18.920]  all those, we're going to mirror them as well, and then fallwars.com, it's stopthecrime.net.
[02:38:18.920 --> 02:38:23.640]  So get into it. Well, yes, Alex, I'm a researcher and I come from a 30-plus
[02:38:23.640 --> 02:38:28.560]  year land development self-employment business with my family, and so I've
[02:38:28.560 --> 02:38:32.680]  been used to a lot of hard work and lots of government documents in the process
[02:38:32.680 --> 02:38:36.520]  of our construction business. But more importantly is what I discovered when I
[02:38:36.520 --> 02:38:41.160]  read the silent weapons for quiet wars document, and what I discovered is that
[02:38:41.160 --> 02:38:44.800]  it was always to have been kept from public scrutiny, and I thought, oh boy.
[02:38:44.800 --> 02:38:49.840]  And so they talk about how in the interest of future world order and
[02:38:49.840 --> 02:38:55.280]  peace and tranquility, now this is for the elite world peace and tranquility, it was
[02:38:55.280 --> 02:38:59.960]  decided to privately wage a quiet war against the American public with the
[02:38:59.960 --> 02:39:04.920]  ultimate objective to permanently shift the natural and social energy or the
[02:39:04.920 --> 02:39:09.800]  wealth from the undisciplined, irresponsible, many into the hands of
[02:39:09.800 --> 02:39:15.040]  the self-disciplined, responsible, worthy few. And it's extremely important to
[02:39:15.040 --> 02:39:18.720]  understand how they said in order to implement this objective, it was
[02:39:18.720 --> 02:39:23.720]  necessary to create, secure, and apply new weapons, which as it turned out were a
[02:39:23.720 --> 02:39:27.760]  class of weapons so subtle and sophisticated that in the principle of
[02:39:27.760 --> 02:39:32.480]  their operation, the public's appearance, as to earn themselves the
[02:39:32.480 --> 02:39:36.520]  name Silent Weapons. Now what is the Silent Weapon System? It is what is
[02:39:36.520 --> 02:39:40.120]  happening right now in our country. We're being hit with fluorides, they're
[02:39:40.120 --> 02:39:44.640]  poisoning our air, water, land, food, you name it. We're under massive weaponization
[02:39:44.640 --> 02:39:49.800]  attack with the overhead, chemtrailing as well as the horrible horrific storms.
[02:39:49.800 --> 02:39:54.320]  This is all part of the Silent Weapon System, and they say that the public
[02:39:54.320 --> 02:39:57.960]  won't be able to comprehend this weapon, and therefore they won't even believe
[02:39:57.960 --> 02:40:01.440]  that they're being attacked or subdued by any weapon at all. But we all
[02:40:01.440 --> 02:40:05.200]  instinctively know they say that something is wrong. We just don't know
[02:40:05.200 --> 02:40:09.480]  how to cry out and ask for help. Well now you do. You can go to stopthecrime.net
[02:40:09.480 --> 02:40:14.280]  and you can download this most important document, only 44 pages. And they say
[02:40:14.280 --> 02:40:19.560]  that when this Silent Weapon is applied gradually, the public adjusts and adapts
[02:40:19.560 --> 02:40:24.800]  to its presence and learns to tolerate its encroachment on their lines until the
[02:40:24.800 --> 02:40:29.080]  pressure, both psychologically and economically, becomes too great and we
[02:40:29.080 --> 02:40:34.000]  crack up. They say it's a type of biological weapon. It attacks our
[02:40:34.000 --> 02:40:40.200]  vitality, our options, and mobility of individuals of a society by knowing.
[02:40:40.200 --> 02:40:45.320]  That's an essay. That's the knowing. Understanding, manipulating, and attacking
[02:40:45.320 --> 02:40:50.560]  our sources of natural social energy and our physical, mental, emotional strengths
[02:40:50.560 --> 02:40:55.320]  and weaknesses. Now it's extremely important to understand that what they
[02:40:55.320 --> 02:41:00.880]  talk about Rothschild said back during the time that this was put together,
[02:41:00.880 --> 02:41:06.240]  that he discovered a basic principle of power and influence and control over the
[02:41:06.240 --> 02:41:11.280]  people as it was applied to economics. That the principle is when you assume the
[02:41:11.280 --> 02:41:16.240]  appearance of power, people soon give it to you. So the bottom line here is that
[02:41:16.240 --> 02:41:20.600]  we can no longer consent. We have to read these documents. We have to understand
[02:41:20.600 --> 02:41:24.920]  what we're agreeing to and we're not. But what is the most concerning aspect in
[02:41:24.920 --> 02:41:28.640]  this document? Well, there are many, of course. But one thing that I'm going to
[02:41:28.640 --> 02:41:34.320]  get into right now, Alex, because this is horrifying to me, it says the final key
[02:41:34.320 --> 02:41:39.680]  to economic control had to wait until there was sufficient data and high
[02:41:39.680 --> 02:41:45.680]  speed computing and equipment. And then they go on to talk about how energy is
[02:41:45.680 --> 02:41:51.640]  the key to all activity on the face of the earth. It follows that in first order
[02:41:51.640 --> 02:41:56.600]  to attain monopoly over the energy, raw materials, goods and services, and to
[02:41:56.600 --> 02:42:02.520]  establish a world system of slave labor, it is necessary to have first strike
[02:42:02.520 --> 02:42:07.720]  capability in the field of economics. In order to maintain our position, it is
[02:42:07.720 --> 02:42:13.240]  necessary that we have absolute first knowledge of science of control over all
[02:42:13.240 --> 02:42:19.000]  economic factors and first experience at engineering the world economy. And they
[02:42:19.000 --> 02:42:25.040]  go on to say that this must be achieved so that the public will make
[02:42:25.040 --> 02:42:29.680]  not either a logical or mathematical connection between economics and the
[02:42:29.680 --> 02:42:34.960]  other energy sciences or learn to apply such knowledge. Now, why this is so
[02:42:34.960 --> 02:42:40.320]  horrifying? Is this supersedes all the prior conversation about UN Agenda 21
[02:42:40.320 --> 02:42:44.640]  and the massive land grab that we see happening all over the world and in the
[02:42:44.640 --> 02:42:50.040]  United States with farms and ranches? Because they want it all. All energy. What
[02:42:50.040 --> 02:42:56.760]  does that mean? We are energy. Every single thing is energy. Our body is 70%
[02:42:56.760 --> 02:43:02.160]  water. Our brain is 87% water. What holds them together? Energy. Everything is
[02:43:02.160 --> 02:43:06.120]  energy. It's vibrating frequencies. So that's going to lead me into this
[02:43:06.120 --> 02:43:09.600]  document that we found on the White House website that everybody needs to go
[02:43:09.600 --> 02:43:13.840]  to stopthecrime.net and take a look at. We've had a number of experts from all
[02:43:13.840 --> 02:43:18.760]  over the world weigh in on this. And this is horrifying. The name of the
[02:43:18.760 --> 02:43:23.160]  document, again, you can go to stopthecrime.net and flashing at the very
[02:43:23.160 --> 02:43:30.400]  top of the homepage is where you'll find that document. And it says electronic
[02:43:30.400 --> 02:43:35.800]  harassment, stalking, mind control, new leaked documents here. Go there. You'll
[02:43:35.800 --> 02:43:39.760]  see the document entitled Realizing the Full Potential of Government Health
[02:43:39.760 --> 02:43:44.800]  Spectrum to Spur Economic Growth. Economic growth is not our growth. We're the
[02:43:44.800 --> 02:43:48.760]  enemies of the state. Now keep in mind we're a corporate structure. We're no
[02:43:48.760 --> 02:43:53.720]  longer under a constitution. We've been hijacked. We've been seized. The 1933
[02:43:53.720 --> 02:43:58.640]  bankruptcy tells us that we were collateralized against the debt, the
[02:43:58.640 --> 02:44:03.000]  gold that was stolen. Everything about us has been collateralized. We were not
[02:44:03.000 --> 02:44:07.960]  taught that in school. We are enemies of the state according to the bankruptcy.
[02:44:07.960 --> 02:44:12.160]  So go to stopthecrime.net to learn about that. And they're going to have to go
[02:44:12.160 --> 02:44:16.280]  there later because we're crashing your website right now, just so you know. Okay.
[02:44:16.280 --> 02:44:20.200]  So if you want, we'll mirror some of that over on infallwars.com. I can ask Kurt
[02:44:20.200 --> 02:44:23.880]  and Emma to do that. I want to tell you more about this document because this is
[02:44:23.880 --> 02:44:27.280]  critical. And as people are able to get to our website, you've got to
[02:44:27.280 --> 02:44:34.120]  understand is happening right now is they're targeting the United States, the
[02:44:34.120 --> 02:44:37.640]  military industrial complex with increased frequencies and radar. And it
[02:44:37.640 --> 02:44:43.040]  is the silent systems deployment. And what this is, what this 13-page document
[02:44:43.040 --> 02:44:47.480]  represents, and we've got the map right next to it on our website, Alex, is
[02:44:47.480 --> 02:44:51.720]  psychotronic weapons for mass mind control. And this is the use of quantum
[02:44:51.720 --> 02:44:55.760]  computers. Now, for people that need to understand what quantum computers are,
[02:44:55.760 --> 02:45:00.520]  you need to watch Eagle Eye by Spielberg. That will give you some kind of an idea.
[02:45:00.520 --> 02:45:04.400]  But this is absolute total mind theft. This is an invasion of the human brain
[02:45:04.400 --> 02:45:08.320]  with artificial intelligence. What this means is what we're seeing now in these
[02:45:08.320 --> 02:45:12.880]  mass shootings, where they're controlling our specific thoughts, our emotions, and
[02:45:12.880 --> 02:45:19.040]  able to direct our physical actions and energy and our physical actions into
[02:45:19.040 --> 02:45:23.240]  unsuspecting people. So this is going to increase. This is the new weaponized
[02:45:23.240 --> 02:45:28.920]  warfare. And it's extremely important to understand that one of the experts that
[02:45:28.920 --> 02:45:32.640]  weighed in on this told us as they amp up the frequencies around the United
[02:45:32.640 --> 02:45:37.600]  States, which you'll see on the map, a frequency fence around all the coastal
[02:45:37.600 --> 02:45:44.440]  states, the Pacific Coast, the Eastern Seaboard, and all of the other areas
[02:45:44.440 --> 02:45:49.160]  that abut the water. You'll see this frequency fence. And this is a map that
[02:45:49.160 --> 02:45:52.520]  shows the end of free will as we have known it. There's absolutely no
[02:45:52.520 --> 02:45:56.320]  question about it, Alex. And when I was researching the smart meters, of course,
[02:45:56.320 --> 02:46:02.680]  I came across continually the corporations. We're run by corporations. And
[02:46:02.680 --> 02:46:06.520]  this is also fascinating and something that everybody needs to understand. We
[02:46:06.520 --> 02:46:11.320]  are run by corporate contracts. They're behind everything that doesn't make
[02:46:11.320 --> 02:46:15.440]  sense. Everything is on the Delphi program through the RAM techniques. So when
[02:46:15.440 --> 02:46:19.560]  we go to meetings, everything has predetermined outcomes and consensus.
[02:46:19.560 --> 02:46:24.720]  They're not listening to us, period. It's all been predetermined. You can
[02:46:24.720 --> 02:46:29.640]  understand. This is all subtle mind control. We leave meetings scratching our
[02:46:29.640 --> 02:46:33.440]  heads. No one listens to the fact that we bring doctors and documents. We don't
[02:46:33.440 --> 02:46:37.880]  want fluoride in our water supply. They're fluoridating us because this
[02:46:37.880 --> 02:46:43.280]  is the plan. This is a silent weapons attack. And in this document, you will
[02:46:43.280 --> 02:46:47.400]  see the White House Spectrum Management Team. It consists of Google,
[02:46:47.400 --> 02:46:52.000]  Microsoft, Stanford, and Harvard University. Harvard was involved in the
[02:46:52.000 --> 02:46:56.400]  Silent Weapons for Quiet Wars document. Virginia Tech, UC Berkeley, who
[02:46:56.400 --> 02:47:02.040]  denies geoengineering program, even exists. The National Telecommunications
[02:47:02.040 --> 02:47:07.920]  Information, the FCC, and NFA just to name a few. So I can only tell you that
[02:47:07.920 --> 02:47:13.160]  this is an attack. This is to take our minds and what they're planning to do,
[02:47:13.160 --> 02:47:16.760]  which they've been doing for many years. And I know last week, Alex, you had
[02:47:16.760 --> 02:47:20.800]  someone on the program talking about targeted individuals with electronic
[02:47:20.800 --> 02:47:26.520]  harassment and government gang stalking and private gang stalking as well. This
[02:47:26.520 --> 02:47:30.560]  is real. Everyone needs to do some homework on this. You're going to have
[02:47:30.560 --> 02:47:34.680]  many people within your communities that are targeted with frequencies. They
[02:47:34.680 --> 02:47:40.880]  say in the NASA war document on page 45 that beam weapons will become
[02:47:40.880 --> 02:47:45.520]  increasingly prevalent. They talk about how they will use a micron-sized
[02:47:45.520 --> 02:47:49.360]  dust as an aerosol. And when it's inhaled into the lungs, it will bore
[02:47:49.360 --> 02:47:53.880]  into our lung tissues and execute various pathological missions. Well, let
[02:47:53.880 --> 02:47:58.320]  me tell you something about that dust. That dust is also involved in mind
[02:47:58.320 --> 02:48:04.360]  control. So we are being hit massively by a silent weapon system. And so in
[02:48:04.360 --> 02:48:08.120]  order to understand it, you've got to read the Silent Weapons document. You've
[02:48:08.120 --> 02:48:14.080]  also got to read the New World Order Exposed 1969, as well as understand the
[02:48:14.080 --> 02:48:18.640]  Iron Mountain Report and understand that the underpinnings of all of this is the
[02:48:18.640 --> 02:48:23.120]  false and fake and phony science that were being sold as climate change and
[02:48:23.120 --> 02:48:27.840]  global warming to get us to give it all up under the requirement of reducing
[02:48:27.840 --> 02:48:32.360]  greenhouse gas and CO2 emissions. And what I found out, Alex, with the smart
[02:48:32.360 --> 02:48:37.840]  meter is all of our hard work to get the opt out and to get the sense that we
[02:48:37.840 --> 02:48:43.040]  had a victory was, of course, all just an appeasement plan. I found out that in
[02:48:43.040 --> 02:48:48.560]  every single city nationwide, nationwide, that in the back door, with by
[02:48:48.560 --> 02:48:52.760]  executive order, there are climate action plans and or energy action plans
[02:48:52.760 --> 02:48:57.800]  being approved by your planning department and approved by your city
[02:48:57.800 --> 02:49:02.560]  council everywhere. And this climate action plan requires smart meters and
[02:49:02.560 --> 02:49:06.480]  not only requires smart meters, it requires everybody to replace their old
[02:49:06.480 --> 02:49:10.880]  inefficient old clunker appliances, but not to worry. They will have green
[02:49:10.880 --> 02:49:17.240]  loans so that you can finance. And they say the average cost of replacement of
[02:49:17.240 --> 02:49:22.200]  appliances and household is between $2,000 and $5,000. And we are in a
[02:49:22.200 --> 02:49:26.600]  recession. They're going to re-force, they're going to force the replacement to
[02:49:26.600 --> 02:49:31.520]  energy star appliances. What is even more horrific is the fact that they
[02:49:31.520 --> 02:49:37.280]  want to stop using gas appliances. Gas appliances and equipment are to be
[02:49:37.280 --> 02:49:43.280]  transitioned into electric only. And I can tell you that you can find this on
[02:49:43.280 --> 02:49:47.720]  our website. I've done an article on this. It's called Exposed. Smart meters
[02:49:47.720 --> 02:49:53.000]  hidden implementation, tactics and breaking news. By the way, just to add
[02:49:53.000 --> 02:49:59.440]  again, the former CIA director Petraeus last year, Wired Magazine reported a
[02:49:59.440 --> 02:50:03.520]  conference, he said, all the new appliances are surveilling you. We're
[02:50:03.520 --> 02:50:08.800]  watching you. This is not debatable. What's insane is, I'm not even against
[02:50:08.800 --> 02:50:13.840]  technology, but the smart meters are imperial probe droids. Attach the side
[02:50:13.840 --> 02:50:18.360]  of your house, dialing into everything, watching and listening to you, data over
[02:50:18.360 --> 02:50:26.080]  power line. And DARPA, I mean, I've read DARPA in the Baltimore Sun, admit 14
[02:50:26.080 --> 02:50:30.160]  years ago that they were testing ultra low frequency over cell towers to quote
[02:50:30.160 --> 02:50:33.400]  calm the public. I have Fox News. We're going to break, we're going to come back at
[02:50:33.400 --> 02:50:38.400]  your take on this. Fox News saying, we're looking at putting lithium in the
[02:50:38.400 --> 02:50:43.480]  water to make you calm and happy. So they're just admittedly rolling all this
[02:50:43.480 --> 02:50:50.360]  out and pushing GMO on people that on record sterilizes and kills the rats
[02:50:50.360 --> 02:50:55.760]  that it's fed to. So it's just insane because they are insane. And I want to
[02:50:55.760 --> 02:50:59.240]  ask you, Deborah, what you think their end game is from reading all their
[02:50:59.240 --> 02:51:04.760]  documents? Turn your food waste into fertilizer. That's right. Turn your food
[02:51:04.760 --> 02:51:09.960]  waste into fertilizer with the Bokashi kits from tarragonics.com. Stop breaking
[02:51:09.960 --> 02:51:13.640]  your back, turning those big piles of food waste and stop attracting a bunch
[02:51:13.640 --> 02:51:18.240]  of unwanted pests and flies. Recycle your leftover vegetable peels, eggshells,
[02:51:18.240 --> 02:51:23.240]  coffee grounds, bread, pizza crusts and more with no foul smells, heavy lifting
[02:51:23.240 --> 02:51:28.240]  or turning. It's easy. Finally, a way to recycle all of your food waste safely
[02:51:28.240 --> 02:51:32.440]  and effectively. Bokashi kits turn food waste into fertilizer in as fast as two
[02:51:32.440 --> 02:51:36.480]  weeks. So it takes less time to create nutrient-rich humus for your garden or
[02:51:36.480 --> 02:51:41.440]  crops. No turning and no obnoxious odors. Recycle all your food wastes. It's as
[02:51:41.440 --> 02:51:46.120]  easy as one, two, three. See the Bokashi system and order your Bokashi kit online

[02:52:52.920 --> 02:52:59.920]  Why does the United States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world
[02:53:22.920 --> 02:53:29.920]  in the United States?
[02:53:52.920 --> 02:53:59.920]  Thank you for watching.
[02:54:22.920 --> 02:54:29.920]  Shouldn't be butchering a great song. Folks, I've read so many declassified government
[02:54:37.360 --> 02:54:42.480]  documents, mainstream news articles. 15 years ago they had Coke Machines that
[02:54:42.480 --> 02:54:47.960]  projected sound into your inner ear. In Tokyo and L.A. I had the CEO on now and
[02:54:47.960 --> 02:54:53.880]  Times Square. They've got a system. I have the article right here in my stack with
[02:54:53.880 --> 02:54:59.240]  the headline that schizophrenia becomes the new advertising campaign. And there
[02:54:59.240 --> 02:55:02.480]  are certainly crazy people out there that think they're being messed with, but
[02:55:02.480 --> 02:55:05.840]  there's a lot of studies out there that show television, watching, video games,
[02:55:05.840 --> 02:55:13.040]  all this electromagnetic radiation is really making people become very
[02:55:13.040 --> 02:55:17.800]  agitated mentally ill. They show that just using a cell phone for a few minutes
[02:55:17.800 --> 02:55:22.960]  heats the brain one degree. That's BBC. In fact, they found the headline. Let's
[02:55:22.960 --> 02:55:27.960]  punch that back up. Good job, guys. I couldn't find the article, so the other
[02:55:27.960 --> 02:55:32.000]  guys found it. Schizophrenia is the new ad gimmick. I don't know how the crew finds
[02:55:32.000 --> 02:55:36.400]  stuff so fast now, especially Chris Jordan. Literally like a lightning bolt of
[02:55:36.400 --> 02:55:41.880]  speed and precision. But there it is. Schizophrenia is the new ad gimmick. And
[02:55:41.880 --> 02:55:47.120]  then, oh, little projectors up there that projected into your middle ear. Now, you
[02:55:47.120 --> 02:55:50.880]  have to understand, folks, I was telling people about this 15 years ago with the
[02:55:50.880 --> 02:55:55.600]  patents and people will walk up to me on the street and say I was a liar. And then
[02:55:55.600 --> 02:56:00.000]  I found law enforcement publications where they were admittedly buying them to
[02:56:00.000 --> 02:56:06.760]  torture people. And I showed you that. Shomer Tech advertises shut down free
[02:56:06.760 --> 02:56:12.080]  speech with a supersonic nauseator. I mean, this is the stuff that's going on.
[02:56:12.080 --> 02:56:17.920]  You can't even hear it, but it makes you sick. It's ultra low frequency. And it's
[02:56:17.920 --> 02:56:22.800]  so frustrating to see the public not aware of all this. And then here's a new
[02:56:22.800 --> 02:56:27.960]  video up on infowars.com. Just breaking it infowars.com. Dad charged with second
[02:56:27.960 --> 02:56:32.880]  degree assault on cop after he questioned common core curriculum. That's where
[02:56:32.880 --> 02:56:37.040]  they teach you two plus two, my equal five. That's an actual quote of it. And he
[02:56:37.040 --> 02:56:39.520]  got up and said, no, this is wrong. They said, no, you're not allowed to speak at
[02:56:39.520 --> 02:56:43.880]  PTA. The cop comes over and shoves him and grabs him. The guy pulls his arm away.
[02:56:43.880 --> 02:56:49.080]  Cop arresting. He's charged. And this is how the secret police work, ladies and
[02:56:49.080 --> 02:56:54.240]  gentlemen, in America. They put their hands on you. You pull away. That's
[02:56:54.240 --> 02:56:58.560]  terrorism. Okay. And they're coming. They're coming. They're trained that
[02:56:58.560 --> 02:57:04.440]  government is God. And they're hiring all these people out there to become the
[02:57:04.440 --> 02:57:08.400]  new enforcers. And we're in deep trouble. So how dare a parent go warn other
[02:57:08.400 --> 02:57:11.840]  sheep? That's not Delphi technique. He's going to be shut down. We've only got a
[02:57:11.840 --> 02:57:14.680]  few minutes left before we go to break and go into overdrive. But the big
[02:57:14.680 --> 02:57:19.880]  picture from reading these documents, it's obviously get us incapacitated. Get
[02:57:19.880 --> 02:57:25.520]  us dumbed down Debra Tavares so they can accelerate the use of the weapons
[02:57:25.520 --> 02:57:29.560]  until we're just outright dying in mass, as we already are statistically, but
[02:57:29.560 --> 02:57:32.960]  where it's open to where no one can resist. Is that what you've found? Or is
[02:57:32.960 --> 02:57:36.800]  that incorrect? Absolutely. They're stealing all of our wealth. They're
[02:57:36.800 --> 02:57:41.000]  absolutely hollowing out the middle class in the United States. I recently
[02:57:41.000 --> 02:57:45.280]  listened to Al Gore talk at an event and he said all the jobs have been shipped
[02:57:45.280 --> 02:57:50.200]  off the, you know, to China and offshore. They won't be coming back. What
[02:57:50.200 --> 02:57:55.440]  they're doing is this is transhumanism. They're transitioning us. They're
[02:57:55.440 --> 02:57:59.920]  changing our species. This is their plan. And when you look at the NAFTA war
[02:57:59.920 --> 02:58:04.400]  plan on page nine, they say humans have taken over and vastly shortened
[02:58:04.400 --> 02:58:09.720]  evolution and they will direct a new evolution. I can't recommend any more
[02:58:09.720 --> 02:58:14.640]  highly for people to watch the Island of Dr. Moreau and get an idea of what is
[02:58:14.640 --> 02:58:18.960]  happening. We're under transformation right now with all of the
[02:58:18.960 --> 02:58:25.200]  chemtrailing. We all have nanofibers in us. Everything. My grandchildren, my
[02:58:25.200 --> 02:58:29.800]  pets, my whole family, everybody has nanofibers. Well, that's like Mike Adams says.
[02:58:29.800 --> 02:58:32.560]  Stay there. They're gonna come back and let you get into this. Amazing information.
[02:58:32.560 --> 02:58:36.200]  Like Mike Adams said, they've already irrevocably damaged us. We're already
[02:58:36.200 --> 02:58:41.960]  walking dead. I mean, we're under military attack, ladies and gentlemen.

[02:59:51.320 --> 02:59:57.320]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin. You're listening to the Alex Jones
[02:59:57.320 --> 03:00:00.640]  Broadcasting Network.
[03:00:05.000 --> 03:00:12.760]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does
[03:00:12.760 --> 03:00:20.440]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin, Texas,
[03:00:20.440 --> 03:00:27.080]  Alex Jones. Well, if you go to a PTA meeting and question why your kids are
[03:00:27.080 --> 03:00:33.280]  being taught 2 plus 2 equals 5 or being taught how to be gangster hoes and run
[03:00:33.280 --> 03:00:39.680]  game, they actually teach ebonics now in the schools, you will be arrested. The
[03:00:39.680 --> 03:00:45.320]  video's up on infowars.com. Now, if that isn't mind-control, where they're
[03:00:45.320 --> 03:00:51.040]  teaching kids how to not be able to read and write, how to not be able to add, this
[03:00:51.040 --> 03:00:55.280]  ladies and gentlemen is the system of total control and you talk about
[03:00:55.280 --> 03:01:01.520]  diabolical. This is how they are trying to wreck society. We are joined right now
[03:01:01.520 --> 03:01:08.160]  here on air by a very informed lady, Deborah Tavares, and we're going to give
[03:01:08.160 --> 03:01:11.280]  you some of her websites, her main site, having some problems because there's so
[03:01:11.280 --> 03:01:14.960]  much traffic, but we'll list some of those other sites as well. Coming up in the
[03:01:14.960 --> 03:01:18.640]  next segment, this is only a five-minute segment, so start getting back into all
[03:01:18.640 --> 03:01:24.160]  the systems rolling out, what they're doing, what the plan is. Society will now
[03:01:24.160 --> 03:01:28.120]  start breaking down even faster because of all the electronic manipulation, then
[03:01:28.120 --> 03:01:31.800]  their answer will be more police state. They've really figured this out. Yes, they
[03:01:31.800 --> 03:01:35.520]  have, Alex. As a matter of fact, at this point, I've got to just tell everybody
[03:01:35.520 --> 03:01:41.960]  what they can do. They must eliminate as much wireless communication devices that
[03:01:41.960 --> 03:01:46.720]  they are able to. Go and buy corded phones. Do not use the deck phones or the
[03:01:46.720 --> 03:01:51.360]  hand-free phones. Do not ever use your cell phone in your car. It's like being
[03:01:51.360 --> 03:01:56.920]  inside a Faraday cage, wearing that. It bounces off many times from the inside
[03:01:56.920 --> 03:02:01.160]  of your car and bounces through your dices and slices, your DNA. It's making you sick.
[03:02:01.160 --> 03:02:06.560]  We can't afford any wireless technology now because of all of the chemicals and
[03:02:06.560 --> 03:02:11.120]  biologicals that they're dumping on us. If you want to survive longer, you've got
[03:02:11.120 --> 03:02:16.520]  to eliminate all Wi-Fi, etc. In fact, that is why they want Wi-Fi in the schools
[03:02:16.520 --> 03:02:21.480]  for our young children. Not only will it eliminate and prevent and increase
[03:02:21.480 --> 03:02:27.160]  infertility, but it will also cause deformity for as many generations as
[03:02:27.160 --> 03:02:31.520]  little girls have. 57% of little girls' eggs are going to be affected by this.
[03:02:31.520 --> 03:02:35.840]  They know this. This is no accident. So go to our website. You've got to get this
[03:02:35.840 --> 03:02:41.120]  out in mass distribution. It's warning to all police, fire, and first responders
[03:02:41.120 --> 03:02:46.480]  about their wireless communication devices and how those are used to
[03:02:46.480 --> 03:02:50.520]  affect their brains with the pulse microwave radiation. You've got to get
[03:02:50.520 --> 03:02:54.680]  this out to them because you'll understand why increased anger is
[03:02:54.680 --> 03:02:59.360]  happening on the streets, why we're seeing an overuse and overreach of anger.
[03:02:59.360 --> 03:03:03.920]  It is largely frequencies and the fact that they're jamming our immune
[03:03:03.920 --> 03:03:08.120]  systems. We're not able to get into our REM level of sleep at night because
[03:03:08.120 --> 03:03:12.440]  they're amping it up at night. We are in massive trouble, so we've got to do every
[03:03:12.440 --> 03:03:17.320]  single thing we can. Buy extra phones. I found out in Europe that a lot of the
[03:03:17.320 --> 03:03:21.400]  corded phones are not even available anymore, so people are stocking up as
[03:03:21.400 --> 03:03:26.280]  best they can to stay wired as possible. There are other things on our solution
[03:03:26.280 --> 03:03:30.560]  page that you can do just as we always have had to have water purification
[03:03:30.560 --> 03:03:35.280]  systems for our homes to clean up and try to clean up the poison toxic water
[03:03:35.280 --> 03:03:39.280]  that they put in our, the poison they put in our water supply, but we now need to
[03:03:39.280 --> 03:03:43.840]  use equipment that will reverse and push back some of the frequencies, the
[03:03:43.840 --> 03:03:47.480]  transient frequencies that are coming into our homes. There's ideas on our
[03:03:47.480 --> 03:03:53.040]  website for that. I can also say that you've got to print down the microwave
[03:03:53.040 --> 03:03:59.120]  radiation frequency Wi-Fi symptoms list on the landing page of stopthecrime.net.
[03:03:59.120 --> 03:04:04.120]  Understand the feelings that you're going to have so that you can print this
[03:04:04.120 --> 03:04:09.560]  off and you can help other people know. I just had a situation where just last
[03:04:09.560 --> 03:04:14.560]  week someone actually had a seizure in a parking lot and no one understood why.
[03:04:14.560 --> 03:04:18.480]  Well, they had their cell phone. Seizures are going to become much, much more
[03:04:18.480 --> 03:04:23.480]  common. Understand these are frequencies. These people are likely living in a
[03:04:23.480 --> 03:04:29.800]  polluted EMF, microwave frequency, polluted area. We're under mass mind
[03:04:29.800 --> 03:04:36.960]  control. That is the key to control all energy on the planet by the elite. Make no
[03:04:36.960 --> 03:04:41.520]  mistake about it. And so print off the flyer. Understand you're going to have
[03:04:41.520 --> 03:04:45.480]  increased confusion, short-term memory loss. Stay there. We're going to come back
[03:04:45.480 --> 03:04:49.720]  in the next long segment and talk about, I mean, I could pull up the articles where
[03:04:49.720 --> 03:04:54.760]  they admit it causes irritability, heats up the brain, damages DNA. And in fact,
[03:04:54.760 --> 03:04:57.480]  we'll pull up some of those here in the break and have only come back. Articles,
[03:04:57.480 --> 03:04:59.720]  mainstream news, admits this.
[03:05:01.240 --> 03:05:05.520]  Why does the United States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world on
[03:05:05.520 --> 03:05:09.680]  healthcare? Why do we have the highest cancer rates on the planet? The highest
[03:05:09.680 --> 03:05:15.760]  rates of diabetes, autism, and every other major disease? It all comes down to
[03:05:15.760 --> 03:05:21.440]  one thing. We are what we eat. Our food is devoid of nutrition and processed with
[03:05:21.440 --> 03:05:26.520]  poisons and additives. Our water is filled with toxic poisons and big pharma
[03:05:26.520 --> 03:05:31.400]  runoff. All of this has been engineered by design. We can turn the tide against
[03:05:31.400 --> 03:05:36.160]  the eugenicist by giving ourselves the nutrients our body desperately needs. To

[03:08:05.240 --> 03:08:13.000]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does
[03:08:13.000 --> 03:08:20.520]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas,
[03:08:20.520 --> 03:08:24.120]  Alex Jones.
[03:08:33.480 --> 03:08:37.760]  All right, Denver's gonna leave us here in about 10-12 minutes. I'm gonna continue
[03:08:37.760 --> 03:08:40.960]  on because I didn't get to this earlier in the broadcast. Obama had to memorial
[03:08:40.960 --> 03:08:45.920]  yesterday for the Naval Yard saying that we've had five massacres. Time to take
[03:08:45.920 --> 03:08:50.080]  the guns. I want to just point out that some of these are admitted al-Qaeda attacks
[03:08:50.080 --> 03:08:54.440]  that he's now blaming on American gun owners, like the Fort Hood Massacre, which
[03:08:54.440 --> 03:08:58.560]  they will not call a terrorist attack. Now listen, folks, when you look at how
[03:08:58.560 --> 03:09:03.800]  diabolical the globalist are and you read their own reports like Attenborough,
[03:09:03.800 --> 03:09:07.040]  you know, the big scientist in England came out and said, we're a disease. Time
[03:09:07.040 --> 03:09:11.120]  to starve and kill the third world. When you realize Ted Turner says the same thing
[03:09:11.120 --> 03:09:15.320]  and then does this weird feminist thing where he says, you know, only women should
[03:09:15.320 --> 03:09:19.560]  be able to be in government for a hundred years as if men did it, as if men
[03:09:19.560 --> 03:09:25.040]  period are bad. It's total division, black against white, man against woman. It's
[03:09:25.040 --> 03:09:30.040]  all about divide and conquer, divide and conquer, and tell you the problems out
[03:09:30.040 --> 03:09:35.960]  there are because of a black person or a white person or a woman or a man or a
[03:09:35.960 --> 03:09:40.560]  northerner or a southerner or meanwhile, the globalists are manipulating these
[03:09:40.560 --> 03:09:48.560]  clash of civilizations and they know, they know what this frequencies are doing.
[03:09:48.560 --> 03:09:52.400]  They knew 30 years ago when they were testing microwaves. You could just type
[03:09:52.400 --> 03:09:57.640]  in all the studies, there's thousands of them on cell phones and cancer. Why did
[03:09:57.640 --> 03:10:01.560]  they approve it? Why did they do it? Because it's a total control system, your
[03:10:01.560 --> 03:10:06.160]  personal little computer, you carry around with you that is surveilling you
[03:10:06.160 --> 03:10:10.640]  and microwaving you even when you're not using it. Now there's the wired
[03:10:10.640 --> 03:10:15.880]  headline, your cell phone may be or hazardous to your health and cigarettes.
[03:10:15.880 --> 03:10:19.800]  Warning, your cell phone may be hazardous to your health. There's no
[03:10:19.800 --> 03:10:23.400]  may about it. Now they're telling you because they want you to get ready for
[03:10:23.400 --> 03:10:26.960]  all the brain tumors and I've seen studies with it connected to heart
[03:10:26.960 --> 03:10:30.080]  problems because the heart is electrochemical even more than the brain
[03:10:30.080 --> 03:10:33.880]  and that's what pacemakers, people are having to get more and more of them and
[03:10:33.880 --> 03:10:38.520]  we're just being bombarded with this stuff. Okay, going back to Deborah
[03:10:38.520 --> 03:10:44.040]  Tavares here with us, going over this, from your research and going off the
[03:10:44.040 --> 03:10:47.960]  government documents and the thousands of articles, I mean this is admitted, we're
[03:10:47.960 --> 03:10:54.080]  seeing studies of how irritable people are around wireless, how many
[03:10:54.080 --> 03:10:57.680]  medical problems it's causing and now they're saturating it with public
[03:10:57.680 --> 03:11:01.120]  Wi-Fi where you have no way to get away from it. To come in and work in a
[03:11:01.120 --> 03:11:05.520]  technological environment in here, I have to step into a literal chamber of it.
[03:11:05.520 --> 03:11:09.600]  It just feels so good to get out in the woods and away from it. I go out to the
[03:11:09.600 --> 03:11:13.240]  desert where there's no cell phones and I feel I feel 20 years younger. What's
[03:11:13.240 --> 03:11:17.040]  going on here Deborah? Well it's an intention, they know as you said exactly
[03:11:17.040 --> 03:11:20.880]  what they are doing. I want to just make a comment very quickly because we
[03:11:20.880 --> 03:11:26.680]  posted Kaiser Permanente of course which is the Rockefeller founded, has a very
[03:11:26.680 --> 03:11:31.760]  interesting article about limiting screen time for healthier kids. They say
[03:11:31.760 --> 03:11:36.400]  too much screen time is associated with, and that's behind a computer, violent
[03:11:36.400 --> 03:11:40.560]  behavior, poor school performance, lower reading scores, sleep pattern
[03:11:40.560 --> 03:11:45.160]  disturbances, being overweight, consumption of junk food, bad habits
[03:11:45.160 --> 03:11:49.480]  later in life, we have that posted on stopthecrime.net. So they admit to us,
[03:11:49.480 --> 03:11:54.280]  they tell us what we should be doing and then they also tell us in the
[03:11:54.280 --> 03:11:57.880]  documents, Alex, that if we make decisions to kill ourselves then we
[03:11:57.880 --> 03:12:03.000]  deserve to die. But what I want to tell you in the 1996 Telecommunications Act,
[03:12:03.000 --> 03:12:08.320]  they suspended forever our right to freely discuss health effects from cell
[03:12:08.320 --> 03:12:12.200]  towers and where they were located in our cities because buried deep in that
[03:12:12.200 --> 03:12:17.000]  landmark bill in section 704, a Wisconsin senator inserted a little-known
[03:12:17.000 --> 03:12:20.560]  clause that prevents local governments from hearing objections or
[03:12:20.560 --> 03:12:26.720]  challenges to cell phone towers placed or based for health impacts forever. So
[03:12:26.720 --> 03:12:31.400]  I've got to tell you, everyone needs to go to antenna-search.com,
[03:12:31.400 --> 03:12:37.600]  antenna-search.com. Find out where these weapons are nearest your homes, in your
[03:12:37.600 --> 03:12:42.960]  neighborhoods, in your communities. These are weapons. They are lining our freeways
[03:12:42.960 --> 03:12:47.520]  throughout the United States. They're creating a dog fence. This is
[03:12:47.520 --> 03:12:51.920]  agenda 21, reducing our ability to travel. People are not going to feel
[03:12:51.920 --> 03:12:56.200]  well. They will not know why. That's why you must print off the
[03:12:56.200 --> 03:13:00.440]  symptoms list on our website and let people understand because doctors will
[03:13:00.440 --> 03:13:05.360]  not know. They'll give everybody pills and poisons for everything they go into,
[03:13:05.360 --> 03:13:11.400]  go in for that is related to this frequency assault upon us as a quiet
[03:13:11.400 --> 03:13:18.480]  weapon, silent war assault. Absolutely. And I can tell you that they also told us
[03:13:18.480 --> 03:13:25.960]  that as far as the other aspects of what they do to us in the NASA war plan, they
[03:13:25.960 --> 03:13:29.960]  tell us that they're going to use acoustic weaponry. They tell us that all of
[03:13:29.960 --> 03:13:35.040]  this is illegal. This is an illegal assault. They talk about the microwave and
[03:13:35.040 --> 03:13:39.480]  the frequencies, all of the nanotechnology. Yeah, that's what's
[03:13:39.480 --> 03:13:45.040]  frustrating. If you look at the U.S. Code Title 50, Chapter 32, subsection 1,528
[03:13:45.040 --> 03:13:50.560]  paragraph B, it says, oh, it's illegal to do secret testing unless it's for
[03:13:50.560 --> 03:13:55.400]  scientific or law enforcement purposes, including lethal. This criminal
[03:13:55.400 --> 03:13:59.640]  government says they can kill us with secret testing because they love us so
[03:13:59.640 --> 03:14:03.840]  much, just like Obama signed an order two weeks ago to arm al-Qaeda publicly.
[03:14:03.840 --> 03:14:08.040]  Well, Alex, I want to tell you what it says on page 38 of the silent weapons
[03:14:08.040 --> 03:14:14.080]  document. It says this. It says, a nation becomes divided into two very distinct
[03:14:14.080 --> 03:14:19.080]  parts. A docile sub-nation, that is the great silent majority. That they claim
[03:14:19.080 --> 03:14:24.360]  is us. And a political sub-nation, the elite. The political sub-nation remains
[03:14:24.360 --> 03:14:31.840]  attached to the docile sub-nation, tolerates us, leaches us, and leaches all
[03:14:31.840 --> 03:14:37.040]  our subsistence until it grows strong enough to detach itself and then
[03:14:37.040 --> 03:14:42.840]  devour us. So this is what we're seeing right now. And they also say in the
[03:14:42.840 --> 03:14:47.280]  silent weapons document that politicians hold many quasi-military jobs, the
[03:14:47.280 --> 03:14:52.320]  lowest being the police, which are the soldiers, the attorneys and CPAs next to
[03:14:52.320 --> 03:14:57.080]  that who are spies and saboteurs and are licensed, and the judges who shout
[03:14:57.080 --> 03:15:01.680]  orders and run the closed union military shop for whatever the market will
[03:15:01.680 --> 03:15:05.480]  bear. The generals are the industrialists, and the presidential level of
[03:15:05.480 --> 03:15:10.080]  commander-in-chief is shared by the international bankers. So I can only
[03:15:10.080 --> 03:15:14.120]  tell you what they say in this document about our military. Well you know what's
[03:15:14.120 --> 03:15:20.960]  incredible? This is written back in the 70s and it sources stuff in the 40s, but
[03:15:20.960 --> 03:15:28.480]  this particular one, 1979, 74-1120. But my whole point is everything in
[03:15:28.480 --> 03:15:32.680]  here is in separate other government documents that are on record. That's
[03:15:32.680 --> 03:15:38.200]  what's so frustrating is their total, total declaration of war against the
[03:15:38.200 --> 03:15:42.360]  people as you were stating. You can read this and see it as prophecy. They've done
[03:15:42.360 --> 03:15:45.720]  it. Go ahead. That's absolutely right. In fact, if you research the Brookings
[03:15:45.720 --> 03:15:49.840]  Institute, this entire silent weapons system is the foundation of what they're
[03:15:49.840 --> 03:15:55.680]  doing to us as well. We also found on the website about smart meters and the
[03:15:55.680 --> 03:16:00.120]  industry plot to manipulate public acceptance. And what I mean by that is
[03:16:00.120 --> 03:16:06.240]  they are analyzing us at the Vanderbilt University in the sociology department.
[03:16:06.240 --> 03:16:12.120]  They're analyzing us to analyze our resistance to overcome and identify
[03:16:12.120 --> 03:16:16.120]  who's resisting the deployment of smart meters and anything else for that
[03:16:16.120 --> 03:16:21.200]  matter. They analyze it and they implement strategies to discredit and
[03:16:21.200 --> 03:16:26.840]  put down the resistance. The bottom line is to manage our perceptions and
[03:16:26.840 --> 03:16:30.440]  manipulate us. This is what they're doing on every single level. We are the
[03:16:30.440 --> 03:16:35.200]  enemy of the state, period. So you have to understand, police get their paychecks
[03:16:35.200 --> 03:16:39.600]  from the corporation. The mother corporation is USA Inc. All the
[03:16:39.600 --> 03:16:45.120]  corporations like the US Vision Game, the Forestry, they're all corporations
[03:16:45.120 --> 03:16:48.840]  getting paychecks from the mother corporation. This is a corporate
[03:16:48.840 --> 03:16:54.520]  structure. You've got to get in and get the contracts. Get the contracts. This is
[03:16:54.520 --> 03:17:00.640]  not an elusive monster standing on a stage behind a curtain. There are
[03:17:00.640 --> 03:17:04.520]  contracts running this. They tell us in the silent weapons document that they
[03:17:04.520 --> 03:17:09.920]  must maintain bookkeeping practices, that they do not tell us about. Understand,
[03:17:09.920 --> 03:17:16.120]  this is all in this 44-page document. And again, I can't emphasize that people
[03:17:16.120 --> 03:17:21.400]  read this. This is vital. What they say about the military draft is heartbreaking
[03:17:21.400 --> 03:17:26.160]  because they say war is a balancing system by killing the true creditors, the
[03:17:26.160 --> 03:17:31.320]  public, which the elite have taught to exchange true value for inflated
[03:17:31.320 --> 03:17:35.680]  currency. This is what they tell us. And when you look at the last few pages of
[03:17:35.680 --> 03:17:40.680]  the Silent Weapons for Quiet Wars document, you will see exactly why they
[03:17:40.680 --> 03:17:46.920]  started the military. It is a depopulation mechanism. It is a way in
[03:17:46.920 --> 03:17:51.480]  which they say that few efforts of human behavior modification are more
[03:17:51.480 --> 03:17:56.400]  remarkable or more effective than that of the socio-military institution known
[03:17:56.400 --> 03:18:01.560]  as the draft. A primary purpose for the draft or such other institutions is to
[03:18:01.560 --> 03:18:07.800]  instill by intimidation in the young male of a society the uncritical
[03:18:07.800 --> 03:18:11.600]  conviction that the government is omnipotent. He soon has taught that
[03:18:11.600 --> 03:18:17.240]  prayer is too slow to cause any changes and a bullet can make changes
[03:18:17.240 --> 03:18:21.720]  in an instant. Thus a man trained in a religious environment for 18 years of
[03:18:21.720 --> 03:18:25.880]  his life by this instrument of government can be broken down and be
[03:18:25.880 --> 03:18:31.520]  purged of his fantasies and delusions in a matter of a few months. They go even
[03:18:31.520 --> 03:18:35.520]  more interesting is the process by which a young man's parents who
[03:18:35.520 --> 03:18:40.720]  reportedly love him can be induced to send him off to war to his death. It goes
[03:18:40.720 --> 03:18:45.680]  on. I can only tell you that this is 44-page document says it all. It tells
[03:18:45.680 --> 03:18:50.560]  you exactly who we are as far as they are concerned but we are more of them. We
[03:18:50.560 --> 03:18:53.960]  must stop consenting. We've got to get these smart meters off our homes. You've
[03:18:53.960 --> 03:18:58.960]  got to keep these wireless microwave communication devices away from you.
[03:18:58.960 --> 03:19:04.200]  Definitely print off the warning and hand it out to all first responders.
[03:19:04.200 --> 03:19:08.160]  They're putting cell phone towers as you may notice on police department
[03:19:08.160 --> 03:19:11.920]  properties and fire department properties. Why? The recession and they make
[03:19:11.920 --> 03:19:17.520]  money. The cell phone towers industry is paying huge monthly amounts of money for
[03:19:17.520 --> 03:19:21.560]  people to have these towers. They're also putting them in rural land away out in
[03:19:21.560 --> 03:19:25.000]  the boondocks and of course people are getting sick. They're dying. This is not
[03:19:25.000 --> 03:19:29.920]  only land theft. This is mine control. This has multiple levers. And by the way
[03:19:29.920 --> 03:19:33.560]  I've talked to the engineers 15 years ago and I'd roll my eyes. These people that
[03:19:33.560 --> 03:19:36.360]  work for big companies they say look they're running more power into the
[03:19:36.360 --> 03:19:40.560]  cell phones by an order of 5-10 times than we need. They're pulsing it. They're
[03:19:40.560 --> 03:19:44.200]  testing it. And then DARPA would just hide it in plain view as I mentioned in
[03:19:44.200 --> 03:19:49.000]  the Baltimore Sun like 14 years ago and admit oh we're just practicing calming
[03:19:49.000 --> 03:19:53.440]  everybody but for anybody that just tuned in I have PBS.org here an article
[03:19:53.440 --> 03:19:59.280]  getting into a secret testing in the United States including lethal on US
[03:19:59.280 --> 03:20:04.200]  citizens, military troops, you know injecting black people with syphilis. I
[03:20:04.200 --> 03:20:08.920]  mean it's all on record but it's currently all going on. It comes out oh
[03:20:08.920 --> 03:20:13.840]  they secretly sterilize people in California oh but it's needed. They're
[03:20:13.840 --> 03:20:19.160]  just doing all this and then they're actually then funding the poorest people
[03:20:19.160 --> 03:20:23.240]  to have more kids to then get the middle class to think this is all okay. It's
[03:20:23.240 --> 03:20:28.560]  very it's a very very sick synthesis of where they're trying to run both ends of
[03:20:28.560 --> 03:20:33.720]  the equation in their own documents to target anyone independently intelligent
[03:20:33.720 --> 03:20:37.640]  smart who might challenge them controlling the future because they
[03:20:37.640 --> 03:20:40.520]  believe they're going to merge with machines and become God. Now I've been
[03:20:40.520 --> 03:20:43.720]  telling people this for over a decade Google came out and said we're going to
[03:20:43.720 --> 03:20:48.200]  help you live forever but the issue is under Obamacare death care the general
[03:20:48.200 --> 03:20:52.120]  public's not going to get access to all these advanced technologies that's why
[03:20:52.120 --> 03:20:57.440]  they've got to implode civilization now so only they get it in select government
[03:20:57.440 --> 03:21:02.320]  reservations. Well that's absolutely true in fact in the future of the
[03:21:02.320 --> 03:21:06.920]  definition for special needs children it will include children whose parents will
[03:21:06.920 --> 03:21:11.040]  not allow their children to be artificially enhanced. This is where
[03:21:11.040 --> 03:21:15.400]  we're heading. The transhumanists all of them say we're going to take your kids
[03:21:15.400 --> 03:21:19.720]  from you if you won't let us put chips in them and stuff and you're abusing them
[03:21:19.720 --> 03:21:23.360]  not letting them have it and this is what all these movies you're getting
[03:21:23.360 --> 03:21:27.200]  people ready for this the Federation of American Scientists you ought to pull
[03:21:27.200 --> 03:21:31.080]  this document up it's in my book it's hard to find online now and my book's
[03:21:31.080 --> 03:21:35.400]  out of print but it's on prisonplanet.tv but has the footnotes but in the
[03:21:35.400 --> 03:21:39.160]  1970s they met and it was a big Pentagon meeting and then it was
[03:21:39.160 --> 03:21:43.800]  declassified in 2000 by the Federation of American Scientists but the Pentagon
[03:21:43.800 --> 03:21:47.160]  then had it reclassified that happens all the time and they pulled all the
[03:21:47.160 --> 03:21:52.440]  stuff down from online and in it it actually said that the supremacy of the
[03:21:52.440 --> 03:21:58.040]  technocracy is we wipe everybody out except for the elite and we all plug
[03:21:58.040 --> 03:22:04.040]  into machines and are actually in biotanks and our own heat powers the
[03:22:04.040 --> 03:22:07.880]  system and there'll be no more war and it sounds like total lunacy plus it's
[03:22:07.880 --> 03:22:11.280]  from the Matrix folks you heard of that that's actually a Pentagon plan and
[03:22:11.280 --> 03:22:16.920]  again I'm saying this on air it sounds insane this is what they say but so your
[03:22:16.920 --> 03:22:22.560]  body doesn't die you upload into the tank. A guy searched from two days ago
[03:22:22.560 --> 03:22:26.240]  Google says they're gonna help you live forever you're gonna upload into a
[03:22:26.240 --> 03:22:31.440]  machine but not at the point of death you upload before death to learn an
[03:22:31.440 --> 03:22:37.400]  interface and then live in this tank and again these people are insane you
[03:22:37.400 --> 03:22:42.280]  could write a science fiction book where they were really aliens sent here to
[03:22:42.280 --> 03:22:45.720]  take over and kill us covertly but that's not what they're doing that's our
[03:22:45.720 --> 03:22:49.640]  own species there it is Daily Mail will be uploading our entire minds to
[03:22:49.640 --> 03:22:53.840]  computers and our bodies will be replaced by machines and of course they
[03:22:53.840 --> 03:22:59.600]  tell you this will happen by 2025 or 2045 the truth is it's already they're
[03:22:59.600 --> 03:23:04.280]  20 30 years advanced these people are completely out of their minds. That's
[03:23:04.280 --> 03:23:08.880]  absolutely right Alex in fact in the NASA war plan they talk about the
[03:23:08.880 --> 03:23:13.580]  ultimate education approach plug-and-play this is on page 27 they
[03:23:13.580 --> 03:23:17.480]  talk about how there will be very fast uploads in education will be only in
[03:23:17.480 --> 03:23:21.920]  minutes instead of many years this is exactly what they say in the NASA war
[03:23:21.920 --> 03:23:26.760]  plan and this is what they say you when you build up from the silent weapons and
[03:23:26.760 --> 03:23:30.080]  from the New World Order exposed and then from the Iron Mountain then you
[03:23:30.080 --> 03:23:34.200]  look at the NASA war plan you really get it all lined up and then you look at
[03:23:34.200 --> 03:23:37.800]  that document we found on the White House website now another huge concern
[03:23:37.800 --> 03:23:41.760]  that we have is when you do antenna search comm you'll find where all the
[03:23:41.760 --> 03:23:44.920]  cell phone towers are and generally it will give you a four-mile radius
[03:23:44.920 --> 03:23:49.600]  download those because those well first of all they don't include every single
[03:23:49.600 --> 03:23:56.400]  one but most of them now we did a search around the DC the White House and the
[03:23:56.400 --> 03:23:59.600]  number of cell phone towers in the town is around the White House on a half a
[03:23:59.600 --> 03:24:02.760]  mile radius are in the hundreds and hundreds and of course this is all
[03:24:02.760 --> 03:24:08.160]  mind control so we're right now we're researching the likely possibility that
[03:24:08.160 --> 03:24:12.480]  we have a government that is already under mind control because there's just
[03:24:12.480 --> 03:24:16.000]  too many things that are not lining up are not making sense and in all the
[03:24:16.000 --> 03:24:20.560]  documents that I read Alex it says we simply are not asking the right question
[03:24:20.560 --> 03:24:26.080]  and we know their intention is to control everything all energy energy is our
[03:24:26.080 --> 03:24:30.880]  mind that oh well clearly this was a perfect diversion now it turns out that
[03:24:30.880 --> 03:24:36.240]  it's being reported Navy Yard service Obama urges gun law change we're gonna
[03:24:36.240 --> 03:24:41.440]  cover that in a moment but Navy Yard SWAT team stood down BBC and here is
[03:24:41.440 --> 03:24:47.440]  officer.com ATF kept out of loop after Navy Yard shooting and he had ELF on
[03:24:47.440 --> 03:24:52.280]  his gun and work there in an ELF area with the submarines this is really
[03:24:52.280 --> 03:24:56.560]  looking like mind control now and a perfect distraction listen great job
[03:24:56.560 --> 03:25:00.280]  thank you so much I look forward to having you back up on the broadcast soon
[03:25:00.280 --> 03:25:03.720]  Deborah and we'll talk to you again soon thank you so much thank you so much
[03:25:03.720 --> 03:25:08.160]  Alan what an amazing lady you could tell she's on fire on her website she has
[03:25:08.160 --> 03:25:11.600]  all these flyers you can download we need to do more of that too on simple
[03:25:11.600 --> 03:25:15.480]  issues like the fellow reserve vaccines GMOs we've done it before but I want to
[03:25:15.480 --> 03:25:21.560]  make one page where we have everything in one spot so you can go download flyers
[03:25:21.560 --> 03:25:24.880]  and give them to friends and family these videos are like digital flyers you
[03:25:24.880 --> 03:25:28.600]  can send to friends and family but folks unfortunately it's worse than she can
[03:25:28.600 --> 03:25:35.120]  even say it's worse than I can even say Laura's learner who got lowest learner
[03:25:35.120 --> 03:25:40.440]  who got caught persecuting the Tea Party under orders of Obama caught lying
[03:25:40.440 --> 03:25:45.920]  she's now just resigned they just announced that minutes ago she's to be
[03:25:45.920 --> 03:25:56.720]  arrested lowest learner retires official at the IRS leaves after her her
[03:25:56.720 --> 03:26:00.040]  political persecution and you look at these globalists they all have that
[03:26:00.040 --> 03:26:05.360]  sick criminal look in their eyes these are such sickening vicious predatory
[03:26:05.360 --> 03:26:08.880]  people folks these are authoritarians it's happened everywhere else it's
[03:26:08.880 --> 03:26:13.760]  happening here and they've got high-tech weaponry I mean but being aware now is
[03:26:13.760 --> 03:26:18.680]  half the battle and then realizing what they're doing and warning everyone you
[03:26:18.680 --> 03:26:25.400]  know separately I thought it was really disgusting when Obama yesterday there at
[03:26:25.400 --> 03:26:30.720]  the Naval Yard Memorial Service talked about five times since he's been in
[03:26:30.720 --> 03:26:34.600]  office we've had these massacres and mentioned the Fort Hood shooting which
[03:26:34.600 --> 03:26:37.840]  they won't allow him to call it a terrorist event he was under the command
[03:26:37.840 --> 03:26:42.200]  of the Al Qaeda leader that was declared national security they knew he was
[03:26:42.200 --> 03:26:45.720]  going to do it and let him do it and then here they are using stuff they
[03:26:45.720 --> 03:26:49.160]  clearly have engineered bare minimum allowed to happen and then they're
[03:26:49.160 --> 03:26:54.760]  posing as saviors it's disgusting a controlled area where you can't have
[03:26:54.760 --> 03:26:58.560]  guns where you go through all these checkpoints with guns it happens there
[03:26:58.560 --> 03:27:02.880]  and their answer is blame us and take our guns this guy probably wasn't even
[03:27:02.880 --> 03:27:06.160]  part of it it's probably just some person they killed because he knew too
[03:27:06.160 --> 03:27:09.400]  much than shot some people I'm telling you I didn't say it was a false flag the
[03:27:09.400 --> 03:27:13.640]  first four or five days now we're a week later I mean this this is
[03:27:13.640 --> 03:27:19.520]  unbelievable let's go ahead and go to this clip of Obama like a vampire trying
[03:27:19.520 --> 03:27:24.040]  to use these dead people to take all of our rights what troubles us so deeply as
[03:27:24.040 --> 03:27:29.880]  we gather here today is how this senseless violence that took place in
[03:27:29.880 --> 03:27:32.920]  the Navy art echoes other recent tragedies meanwhile they're funding
[03:27:32.920 --> 03:27:36.280]  violence worldwide against Christians and innocent people as president I am
[03:27:36.280 --> 03:27:42.560]  shocked by a live American community they see themselves as technocrats dealing
[03:27:42.560 --> 03:27:47.800]  with an infection Fort Hood they see the masses a dumb group of animals they've
[03:27:47.800 --> 03:27:54.040]  got to take out Sandy Hook Aurora Sandy Hook very staged the Washington Navy
[03:27:54.040 --> 03:28:00.520]  are very staged and these mass shootings occur against a backdrop of daily
[03:28:00.520 --> 03:28:04.680]  tragedies in Chicago where you have this army of gun violence and where the
[03:28:04.680 --> 03:28:07.800]  government ships the drugs in communities across America just like
[03:28:07.800 --> 03:28:13.040]  during prohibition to create the violence of Chicago to neighborhoods not far
[03:28:13.040 --> 03:28:16.560]  from these are social engineers they know how the world works so they
[03:28:16.560 --> 03:28:20.880]  manipulate everybody once again they think we're all a big joke Americans who
[03:28:20.880 --> 03:28:25.080]  were just going about their day going about their day you know doing their
[03:28:25.080 --> 03:28:29.800]  jobs doing their jobs doing what they loved when Al Qaeda went into Syria and
[03:28:29.800 --> 03:28:35.040]  more churches keeps our country strong and our Navy the finest fleet in the
[03:28:35.040 --> 03:28:41.040]  world our Navy that's enough of him their work using American pride to get
[03:28:41.040 --> 03:28:45.280]  everybody behind the tyranny America's been captured America's been taken over
[03:28:45.280 --> 03:28:49.280]  America's been bamboozled and only admitting this will wake everybody up
[03:28:49.280 --> 03:28:53.280]  this is not about entertainment this is not a game folks we're living in a
[03:28:53.280 --> 03:28:57.440]  twilight zone episode and you can't give into it and go watch nothing but
[03:28:57.440 --> 03:29:01.520]  football and get drunk all day and fix everything you've got to become aware of
[03:29:01.520 --> 03:29:05.040]  what's happening I'm only plugged into the matrix so I could fight the
[03:29:05.040 --> 03:29:10.000]  globalist on their own turf I'm fully cognizant of the surveillance and the
[03:29:10.000 --> 03:29:14.360]  poisoning and everything I'm going through I'm fully cognizant of what I'm
[03:29:14.360 --> 03:29:18.560]  doing and how much danger I'm in but I'm more worried about the human species
[03:29:18.560 --> 03:29:25.600]  letting these crazed disgusting globalist run everything now we got a
[03:29:25.600 --> 03:29:29.200]  break we're gonna come back with retransmission with Dr. Jerome Corsi and
[03:29:29.200 --> 03:29:36.680]  our government clearly being behind the Al Qaeda groups that attacked in Kenya and
[03:29:36.680 --> 03:29:41.520]  then back tonight key info or timely news is getting even more informative so
[03:29:41.520 --> 03:29:45.000]  watch us tonight seven o'clock central stand with us and become prison
[03:29:45.000 --> 03:30:13.360]  planet our TV members that is an imperative that is an imperative
