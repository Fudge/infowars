[00:00.000 --> 00:14.160]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones
[00:14.160 --> 00:40.720]  on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:44.160 --> 01:03.240]  well I want back down no I want back down you can stand me up at the gates of hell
[01:03.240 --> 01:18.600]  but I want back down no I stand my ground won't be turned around and I'll keep this world from
[01:18.600 --> 01:28.440]  dragging me down gonna stand my ground well hard to believe it's already Thursday it seems like
[01:28.440 --> 01:35.240]  Monday was just 10 seconds ago hello I'm Alex Jones we're gonna be live here for the next
[01:35.240 --> 01:42.360]  four hours today we have Bev Harris joining us because we're only about 26 days 27 days away
[01:42.360 --> 01:50.760]  from the election and I was thinking to myself why not have the premier expert on election fraud
[01:50.760 --> 01:56.880]  coast-to-coast on the show the reason I thought of her was the elections coming up and I wanted
[01:56.880 --> 02:03.320]  to set her up for right after the election to cover from the field she's always in the field
[02:03.320 --> 02:10.400]  with the worst cases of fraud are with either party behind it I thought about that last week
[02:10.400 --> 02:17.320]  and then I got on the treadmill in the garage turned on HBO and watched about an hour of the
[02:17.320 --> 02:23.560]  documentary hacking democracy and I've seen it several times but it just hit me is so powerful
[02:23.560 --> 02:29.760]  I mean they have the company stealing and cheating and robbing and and and you know they're
[02:29.760 --> 02:33.360]  driving over to try to get the computer tapes the state won't give them in the county won't
[02:33.360 --> 02:37.240]  give them and they catch the employees trying to run out the back door with them in trash bags
[02:37.240 --> 02:41.680]  and fighting with them and they rip open and there's the proof that they stole the election
[02:41.680 --> 02:46.720]  and I mean it's like every minute and a half there's another instance of something like
[02:46.720 --> 02:56.440]  that it is an absolute fact that we don't have the right to vote in most areas of this country
[02:56.440 --> 03:05.280]  and it's very exciting to know that many of us were aware of this there was systemic organized
[03:05.280 --> 03:12.800]  fraud coast-to-coast and that in the last five six years intensifying there has been an effort by
[03:12.800 --> 03:18.320]  the establishment to consolidate that down before elections had to be stole on a county by county
[03:18.320 --> 03:25.520]  level then they'd be sent up to voter new services a private secret consortium who many times a
[03:25.520 --> 03:32.240]  candidate would win Arizona win Texas win New Hampshire it wouldn't matter even if local counties
[03:32.240 --> 03:38.720]  announced that the at the federal level they would just announce a fraudulent tabulation and and
[03:38.720 --> 03:45.200]  then it would end up in local papers that was a fraud but things just move forward but that started
[03:45.200 --> 03:51.720]  to be revealed and so the military industrial complex carrying the shout has now tried to
[03:51.720 --> 03:58.040]  centralize it a little bit more than 40% of the country can now in 90 seconds or less be remote
[03:58.040 --> 04:06.240]  reprogrammed and there's no record of it that's right 40% and growing 40% of the country can be
[04:06.240 --> 04:13.200]  remotely hacked and a fraudulent election can be engaged in with national elections regionally it
[04:13.200 --> 04:21.800]  takes a little more time but literally this is so automated that it's down to one person now can
[04:21.800 --> 04:36.800]  skew 40% of the political sectors jurisdictions of the country a little over 40 so she'll be
[04:36.800 --> 04:41.360]  joining us coming up for a report good moments about six months all the things that have happened
[04:41.360 --> 04:45.400]  what she's been tracking and covering and all the things that have unfolded since the big
[04:45.400 --> 04:51.400]  primaries when they cheated Ron Paul and others in New Hampshire so we'll be breaking that down
[04:51.400 --> 04:57.160]  and a lot more today obviously the stock market's plunging again by design we'll break that down
[04:57.160 --> 05:04.480]  first when we get back on September 11th 2001 along with hundreds of my fellow troops I went to
[05:04.480 --> 05:10.120]  grounds here and we knew what to do at least we thought we did truth rising is a breakthrough

[08:02.200 --> 08:12.200]  Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[08:14.200 --> 08:21.640]  the Paris joining us to track all of the election fraud going up going on and the
[08:23.080 --> 08:28.920]  preparation for it by the military industrial banking crime syndicate that is now
[08:28.920 --> 08:34.280]  sucking the western world dry and vertically integrating all wealth
[08:35.560 --> 08:43.720]  unto themselves also Barack Obama zombies at the debate that was being held at a university
[08:43.720 --> 08:51.000]  they could chant they could yell they could have bull horns but a clear listener of this
[08:51.000 --> 08:55.400]  show I would guess we're gonna try to get them on the show talking about the new world order
[08:55.400 --> 09:00.280]  calmly talking about how the banks are engineering this how they could have bailed out American
[09:00.280 --> 09:04.920]  homeowners for a fraction of what's been given to private banks was just calmly there talking
[09:04.920 --> 09:08.760]  and the police said we're gonna charge you with trespassing and took him off the property
[09:11.160 --> 09:17.400]  and the obamanoids they begin just hooping and cheering and hollering with glee
[09:18.840 --> 09:23.320]  you know I was angry and upset when George Bush had the free speech zones and is violating
[09:23.320 --> 09:29.960]  people's rights and now the democrats think their man is about to be in power and they are
[09:29.960 --> 09:34.840]  very very pleased with all the new police state powers it's it's totally disgusting
[09:35.480 --> 09:42.280]  and now I will go in some of the public's minds from being a hardcore communist that's what neocons
[09:42.280 --> 09:49.320]  call me which is completely ridiculous I'm a hundred eighty hundred eighty degrees away from
[09:49.320 --> 09:59.080]  that state of centralization and I will now be called a right wing neo-nazi fascist because I
[09:59.080 --> 10:03.400]  believe in the first amendment and all of us that want to have a bill of rights a constitution and
[10:03.400 --> 10:10.600]  have liberty now we see the left right paradigm again raising its ugly head and sucking in millions
[10:10.600 --> 10:21.720]  of well-meaning dupes useful idiots as they are properly called so we'll be getting into that as
[10:21.720 --> 10:28.680]  well there are a whole bunch of news reports today I saw at least four newspapers with headlines
[10:28.680 --> 10:33.960]  about the new world order how the private world central banks are going to be taking over the
[10:33.960 --> 10:40.600]  planet basically emerging with government how they are quote quote going to bail out the states and
[10:40.600 --> 10:48.040]  private corporations that means take them over but if I get up here and play a clip of Gordon
[10:48.040 --> 10:54.920]  brown the British prime minister or a US president calling for world government it doesn't exist this
[10:54.920 --> 11:00.760]  willful ignorance this willful denial of reality this global corporate takeover that's happening
[11:00.760 --> 11:06.680]  right now of every major nation state is real and it's criminal and it's going to hurt the
[11:06.680 --> 11:11.560]  average person very bad these are not just tyrants who want power they want to carry out an
[11:11.560 --> 11:18.040]  aggressive eugenics operation okay we're going to get into where the markets are right now
[11:18.040 --> 11:28.520]  on wall street another big plunge in the Dow this morning on banking and auto stocks and others
[11:30.760 --> 11:37.400]  it has been down as much as 200 points it's only down 71 points right now now remember this time
[11:37.400 --> 11:48.600]  last year on october 9th 2007 the stock market was above 14 000 points
[11:51.400 --> 11:58.360]  and on that day we told you that much of its value was inflation and speculation
[11:59.720 --> 12:03.640]  and that the real economy main street was falling apart and the banks were preparing to
[12:03.640 --> 12:07.720]  implode the economy over the next two years and we're now another year into that
[12:10.520 --> 12:15.080]  now i want to play kramer this guy is not stupid he's made hundreds of millions of dollars himself
[12:15.880 --> 12:20.920]  on the stock market playing games he's admitted on video that he's committed many crimes we've
[12:20.920 --> 12:25.880]  played that audio this guy goes on tv and talks about the crimes he would commit in the past
[12:26.440 --> 12:30.760]  because he knows it's all selectively enforced he likes to act like he's for the people
[12:30.760 --> 12:38.360]  but he goes on air and says that the 50 basis points cut isn't enough then you
[12:38.360 --> 12:43.960]  need to go ahead and slash it down to basically zero there's a problem with that
[12:45.160 --> 12:50.840]  that will devalue currencies even more and accelerate the already hyper hyper inflation
[12:50.840 --> 12:57.080]  that is beginning now in amongst his 50 percent baloney 50 percent truth he does tell the truth
[12:57.080 --> 13:03.320]  and say the problem isn't inflation it's depression it's things imploding it's it's
[13:03.960 --> 13:09.640]  a depressionary curve in the economy and that's true now economists until the 70s
[13:09.640 --> 13:14.760]  had always said it was impossible to have depression in the economy and inflation
[13:17.080 --> 13:25.720]  or less goods being bought and the economy massively contracting while you have inflation
[13:25.720 --> 13:33.000]  high inflation but of course i've coined the term hyper stag inflation not only do we have
[13:33.000 --> 13:37.880]  hyper stag inflation starting in the last few years it is now intensifying so you know he
[13:37.880 --> 13:42.680]  tells the truth and says well there's also depression going on or massive contraction
[13:42.680 --> 13:48.280]  in the real economy then he goes on to say the problem is not inflation no it's both of those
[13:48.280 --> 13:59.160]  loans and then he calls for massive slashes in interest rates but here's the problem you
[13:59.160 --> 14:03.880]  the citizen are paying record amounts for credit cards record amounts for mortgages
[14:03.880 --> 14:10.840]  record amounts for auto loans record amounts for home improvement loans and business loans
[14:10.840 --> 14:19.960]  corporate loans and the massive increase in the real interest rate for the american people
[14:19.960 --> 14:25.880]  the people of the world is being tacked on everything we buy in intensifying the inflation
[14:29.480 --> 14:34.200]  so let's go ahead and play this clip and no wonder the public knows the media is lying but
[14:34.200 --> 14:41.960]  the gobbledygook is so twisted that that the average person can't untie it just know this
[14:41.960 --> 14:48.360]  the reason you can't figure it out is because it's pure bull that's why it's pure bull so let's go
[14:48.360 --> 15:02.440]  ahead and play kramer how could we get worldwide coordinated rate cuts and still go down 180
[15:02.440 --> 15:12.840]  dowel points especially when the market was about as oversold as i've ever seen it in the last 20 years
[15:14.680 --> 15:24.760]  can anything save this market maybe but not these little cuts these cuts are simply too little and
[15:24.760 --> 15:31.000]  too late at least to save the stock market all right stop right there hey uh kramer there aren't
[15:31.000 --> 15:38.680]  many more cuts they can make it's it's making foreigners not be able to buy the u.s securities
[15:38.680 --> 15:44.040]  for the money being dumped into your stock market into your companies see if they won't buy the debt
[15:44.040 --> 15:50.280]  because the interest rates too low then the whole game's over pal so what do you say do you say slash
[15:50.280 --> 15:56.680]  the rates even more which will accelerate inflation but remember only the central financial
[15:56.680 --> 16:04.840]  institutions they're the only ones getting low rates the people aren't getting any of that
[16:06.360 --> 16:10.840]  in fact as the economy falls apart and people default on loans real interest rates go up so
[16:10.840 --> 16:16.600]  again everything that's being done is for the elite to consolidate and to make their position
[16:16.600 --> 16:21.800]  that much stronger as they buy up the real assets which they are debasing there's a depression in
[16:21.800 --> 16:28.120]  prices while we have inflation that that never existed until 30 years ago in any known market
[16:28.120 --> 16:36.040]  because it is entirely artificial by the way the elites have not lost control this is a precision
[16:36.040 --> 16:42.520]  operation beautifully done you know how hard it is to create stagflation much less hyper stag inflation
[16:45.080 --> 16:48.200]  it's like trying to balance an elephant on the head of a pin
[16:48.200 --> 16:56.440]  okay these guys are slick folks let's go back to this guy lying everybody these cuts are simply
[16:56.440 --> 17:03.560]  too little and too late at least to save the stock market in 2008 if certainly not the economy
[17:05.000 --> 17:09.880]  stock market said today that the cuts need to be much bigger much more aggressive the
[17:09.880 --> 17:13.000]  bull market at one point was up and that was because i think they were cheering at least
[17:13.000 --> 17:16.520]  the central banks aren't worried about the inflation about inflation anymore they recognize
[17:16.520 --> 17:21.880]  that it's deflation but the a half-point cut doesn't do a thing to help near-term earnings and when
[17:21.880 --> 17:27.080]  you have bad earnings like you have without color the stock gets killed okay and these cuts will
[17:27.080 --> 17:31.560]  not make you big money in the market despite what you heard all day about oh this is the opportunity
[17:31.560 --> 17:36.920]  well great opportunity they will help banks make more money off what's known as the net interest
[17:36.920 --> 17:42.200]  margin they help the prime rate come down these are good things that are often ignored by the media
[17:42.200 --> 17:47.560]  but again they won't matter until late 2009 because they're going to cut cut cut like little salami
[17:47.560 --> 17:53.240]  slices instead of going in there with the chipper shredder we have to distinguish between what this
[17:53.240 --> 17:57.240]  means for the stock market and what it means for the economy let's start with the market these cuts
[17:57.240 --> 18:01.160]  are way too late i'm making that point because you have to understand how could the market go down
[18:01.160 --> 18:05.400]  they're way too late to make you money in stocks plain and simple and they're also too shallow
[18:05.400 --> 18:10.440]  remember our friend buddy pal and greenspan took rates to 1 in 2003 we're one and a half now that
[18:10.440 --> 18:15.000]  wasn't a recession that wasn't even potential great depression it was just a tough economy
[18:15.000 --> 18:19.240]  right so right there too high stop right there that started the slide of the dollar
[18:20.280 --> 18:23.640]  and that made the world face the fact that they'd already issued too much liquidity
[18:25.160 --> 18:29.400]  and then the big financial institutions started bad-mouthing remember two years ago
[18:29.400 --> 18:35.560]  year and a half ago saying that there was too much liquidity being issued to the average citizen
[18:35.560 --> 18:40.120]  and everything was going to be their fault when everything imploded as they set the table
[18:40.120 --> 18:45.960]  for what's happening as they bad mouth the credit being given to the public
[18:46.840 --> 18:52.200]  you see we would have just had ongoing compounded inflation that would lead into hyperinflation
[18:52.200 --> 18:57.560]  but further down the road and that still be tough it'd be bad but they wanted to eat what was left
[18:57.560 --> 19:03.800]  of the real economy so they cut off the credit to the grassroots while then panicking the public
[19:03.800 --> 19:09.080]  saying we need more credit for you you're going to pay for this in taxes and then we get nothing
[19:09.080 --> 19:13.960]  and everything is fed into the financial sector then they have the nerve to get up and and and
[19:13.960 --> 19:18.840]  bad mouth the free market and talk about how socialism is actually good all over the news
[19:18.840 --> 19:23.880]  what the big banks have always financed which again is socializing our wealth and then giving it to
[19:23.880 --> 19:30.360]  them and then now they're selling that as socialism when it's not it's called robbery
[19:31.000 --> 19:35.480]  if somebody goes in a bank and robs your safety deposit boxes that's not socialism that's robbery
[19:35.480 --> 19:44.760]  so this is the biggest heist ever seen in world history and you got this bozo up there
[19:45.800 --> 19:47.800]  telling people what we need is more rate cuts
[19:49.960 --> 19:55.080]  now i'm not calling for what paul volker did of you know 20 interest rates but those suckers
[19:55.080 --> 20:01.720]  need to be high and they need to be high right now a day unlike any other in the long course of
[20:01.720 --> 20:07.800]  american history a terrorist act of war against this country the enemies struck america on september

[26:38.440 --> 26:41.560]  others reported years ago that they were going to bring the market down but they want to slow
[26:42.280 --> 26:49.640]  take down to about 7500 is what they say they're going to do 14 000 points so we've had a
[26:49.640 --> 27:00.360]  close to 5000 point drop in 365 days since this exact time last year
[27:02.920 --> 27:07.080]  so no matter how the stock market opens or closes today or tomorrow next week
[27:07.080 --> 27:13.320]  they have decided to hyperinflate the incurrency now sure you can buy a one ounce american eagle
[27:13.320 --> 27:21.560]  in 1955 for $30 and today you're lucky if you can get that sucker for 980 bucks it's got some mark
[27:21.560 --> 27:30.680]  up on it what does that tell you we've had a lot of inflation since 1950s it was $30 coins close
[27:30.680 --> 27:37.960]  to a thousand but imagine that much increase in price that much devaluation of the currency
[27:37.960 --> 27:45.720]  in a year or two see as much devaluation as we've seen in 50 plus years
[27:48.520 --> 27:55.560]  in a year in two years and then after that you see as much devaluation down to zero
[27:55.560 --> 28:06.200]  in just a few months then you saw in the previous 80 years see it it balloons out on the other end
[28:06.200 --> 28:10.840]  i always use the wrong term telescope telescope would be getting smaller at the end or more
[28:10.840 --> 28:16.920]  value at the end it's i'm doing that butt backwards it's ballooning at the end in a
[28:16.920 --> 28:26.360]  matter of months all the value will race out of it and see they have trained the retirees the yuppies
[28:26.360 --> 28:32.920]  and others that when markets go down you stay in you don't pull out and so psychologically it goes
[28:32.920 --> 28:37.960]  from 14 thousand to 13 thousand then it runs back up to 3400 then it races down to 12000
[28:37.960 --> 28:42.360]  then it goes back up to 13 thousand then it goes down to 11,000 and it goes back up to 1250
[28:43.080 --> 28:49.080]  then it goes down to 10,000 then it goes up to 1150 and it goes down to 9500 then it goes up
[28:49.080 --> 28:55.480]  to 11,000 then it goes down to 9,000 then it goes back up to 9500 training you to accept
[28:55.480 --> 29:00.360]  the large slide to oblivion while the bankers and the money people got their money out years ago
[29:00.360 --> 29:04.760]  while they left the country. They got armored compounds for what they believe is coming.
[29:05.480 --> 29:08.680]  And I come on air and I go, look, it's all over the newspapers that the elites are buying
[29:08.680 --> 29:12.360]  armored compounds and leaving the country. And I know elitists right here in Austin,
[29:12.360 --> 29:15.800]  it's such a wealthy area. You can't throw a rock without hitting one.
[29:17.400 --> 29:22.200]  Most of the people I ran into are new that they're already gone. It's crickets around their house.
[29:24.840 --> 29:29.800]  And I came on air and I warned you about that. What'd I get? Label, Fairmont, everything else.
[29:29.800 --> 29:36.040]  Well, let me tell you something. What we've seen so far is the surface of a much larger iceberg
[29:36.040 --> 29:40.280]  beneath the water. I don't know how bad it's going to get, but it's not going to be pretty.
[29:41.000 --> 29:45.720]  We're going to come back, break down the actual financial numbers and a lot more stay with me.

[38:56.200 --> 39:08.600]  What are we going to do about this crisis? I can do the things that I have in my power to do.
[39:11.240 --> 39:20.840]  And that is educate the public about what's happening.
[39:20.840 --> 39:26.920]  And then it's up to the public to expose this and say that they don't want any part of it.
[39:26.920 --> 39:33.400]  But the public says 1000 to 1,000 plus calls for every one for the bank or takeover.
[39:33.400 --> 39:37.240]  The public did what they were supposed to do. They do understand it's a scam.
[39:37.240 --> 39:41.400]  They don't have any idea just how bad it is. It's even hard for me to grasp.
[39:41.400 --> 39:46.360]  It gets worse than I thought every day. More insane, more ridiculous, more open.
[39:46.360 --> 39:53.000]  They don't even put window dressing on it. The entire group running the cash handout
[39:53.000 --> 39:56.920]  to the bankers is run by the former head of Goldman Sachs and his minion,
[39:56.920 --> 40:03.800]  Cashkari, who just left Goldman Sachs to hand out the trillions to themselves.
[40:05.320 --> 40:09.800]  They sit in the offices of power handing the money directly to themselves.
[40:10.360 --> 40:13.960]  They don't even put it through an offshore corporation. They don't even launder it.
[40:13.960 --> 40:19.400]  They don't even hide it. They just do it. How do you respond to in-your-face
[40:19.400 --> 40:31.160]  criminality of that magnitude? How do you deal with something that corrupt?
[40:33.720 --> 40:39.160]  Global markets fall again as credit remains frozen. There's plenty of money being pumped
[40:39.160 --> 40:43.720]  into the big banks, but none for us. After a tentative rebound, global stock markets turned
[40:43.720 --> 40:47.560]  lower as coordinated rate cut by major central banks, which are owned by the same people,
[40:47.560 --> 40:52.920]  failed to unlock frozen credit markets putting pressure on officials to take further action.
[40:52.920 --> 40:57.240]  The officials are the ones paying themselves the money. I would add to the CNBC report.
[40:58.360 --> 41:02.760]  US shares opened higher, but then fell after a six-day losing streak in which they have shed
[41:02.760 --> 41:11.000]  almost 15%. Even IBM, whose preliminary earnings top forecast, saw its stock fall.
[41:11.800 --> 41:16.600]  The US market faces additional uncertainty after a ban on short-selling of financial
[41:16.600 --> 41:23.080]  stocks expired at midnight on Wednesday. European stocks also were higher, but then fell
[41:24.520 --> 41:29.720]  after a day after hitting nearly five-year lows. Asian stock markets were mixed as Japan's Nikkei
[41:29.720 --> 41:33.800]  dipped to its lowest, closing more than five years of their volatile day.
[41:36.360 --> 41:40.600]  Now, you've got the Wall Street folks that make jokes on TV and radio and in person
[41:41.560 --> 41:45.880]  to all of us. Ah, so what happens to Main Street? So what have we off-shore?
[41:45.880 --> 41:51.960]  So what? All I care about is my stocks. They don't understand that they're inextricably
[41:53.080 --> 41:59.080]  tied to the real economy. Conversely, you have the working stiffs, Joe Sixpack.
[41:59.080 --> 42:02.920]  I've heard them over and over again on radio, TV, and in person. So I'll ask people in the
[42:02.920 --> 42:05.720]  grocery store online, hey, what do you think of the fall in stock market? I don't care,
[42:05.720 --> 42:10.920]  I don't own any stocks. Well, those companies count on those stock values to be able to
[42:10.920 --> 42:17.640]  maintain themselves and expand and employ you. So you don't care about the companies in the market,
[42:17.640 --> 42:24.040]  and it doesn't care about you. See, that's the perfect modern western spoiled rotten person.
[42:24.040 --> 42:28.520]  Now, now, now, get me straight here. I'm not saying this is the fault of the American people,
[42:31.160 --> 42:34.440]  but that doesn't mean the people of the West, not just the United States, but Canada,
[42:34.440 --> 42:40.840]  Europe, England, Australia, didn't get suckered into all of this and weren't trained to trust
[42:40.840 --> 42:45.240]  whatever the establishment said. We certainly take some of the blame for being suckers,
[42:45.240 --> 42:55.080]  but I've used the parallel, the analogy, of somebody coming to your front door and knocking
[42:55.080 --> 43:01.000]  on it, and they stick a gun in your face and rob you. Yeah, you should have been a little more
[43:01.000 --> 43:09.240]  careful, should have asked them who they were first. But you're not at fault for being stuck up,
[43:09.240 --> 43:15.480]  for being robbed, for being hog-tied. Well, they take everything you own.
[43:17.880 --> 43:21.720]  Same thing. Do you blame a five-year-old child that somebody pulls up out front of their house
[43:21.720 --> 43:29.560]  with a van and says, oh, come look at my puppy. I've got candy. The child should have listened
[43:29.560 --> 43:35.000]  to their parents. The child shouldn't have gone and talked to strangers, but you don't blame
[43:35.000 --> 43:41.640]  that five-year-old child. You blame the sack of garbage, the demonic filth that wants to kidnap
[43:42.200 --> 43:49.960]  and kill that child. And that there brings up the other issue. There is evil all around us,
[43:49.960 --> 43:55.080]  evil worldwide in high places and low, and somehow the public was trained that evil didn't exist,
[43:55.080 --> 43:59.720]  and that we could all just, just, just, just, well, the government's trained us not to trust
[43:59.720 --> 44:03.240]  our fellow man, and they've even hyped that up to a greater threat than it actually is,
[44:03.240 --> 44:08.120]  but to trust government, to trust uniforms, to trust the system when statistically and historically
[44:08.120 --> 44:13.640]  it's far more dangerous than your neighbor, or the guy down the street, or your boss, or your
[44:13.640 --> 44:19.000]  employees. But I'll give you corporate numbers I've seen, different market studies, on average
[44:19.000 --> 44:23.880]  about 45 percent of employees steal. I never believed that number when I saw it years ago,
[44:25.160 --> 44:30.760]  but I've seen a lot of examples of it in the real world. Now, if you think the average person
[44:30.760 --> 44:37.960]  is that corrupt, because they feel they're entitled to steal, can you imagine what people
[44:37.960 --> 44:49.320]  in government are like? So, global markets fall again as credit crisis remains, and the banks
[44:49.320 --> 44:53.480]  were saying, we won't jumpstart your economy until you give us total power and control
[44:53.480 --> 44:57.480]  when they engineered the crisis that's now causing it. And look, I know you understand
[44:57.480 --> 45:02.360]  that out there, but I'm not hearing enough other talk radio shows that are getting this correctly.
[45:02.360 --> 45:06.920]  I'm not hearing enough even alternative media getting it right. I am not seeing enough people
[45:06.920 --> 45:11.000]  understand fully what's happening here. I'm starting to see that change, and that's exciting.
[45:12.120 --> 45:18.280]  But just because you know what's going on, doesn't mean other people are aware of it.
[45:18.280 --> 45:19.080]  Remember that.
[45:22.040 --> 45:26.440]  U.S. clothing change falters, shoppers clamp down. U.S. clothing retailer
[45:26.440 --> 45:31.080]  continue to report dismal sale, same-store sale results for September as the global
[45:31.080 --> 45:35.160]  financial crisis further squeezed consumers were already cutting back because of the weak economy.
[45:36.280 --> 45:46.920]  And it goes through Chico's, T, JX, Abacrombie, and Finch. All of them are reporting 15.6%
[45:46.920 --> 45:53.480]  declines, 13% declines, just huge declines in purchases from this time last year.
[45:53.480 --> 45:59.160]  So for those of you that say, oh, I don't care what's happening and then, you know,
[45:59.160 --> 46:04.520]  people that have money. Well, who do you think buys stuff from the business you run or own or work in?
[46:06.920 --> 46:12.520]  It affects everybody. And the biggest problem here in the austerity that's coming by design
[46:13.480 --> 46:18.200]  is that crime is already exploding and it's going to get worse and worse. And don't worry,
[46:18.200 --> 46:21.880]  they hired millions more cops knowing they were going to engineer this as we told you years ago.
[46:21.880 --> 46:26.040]  But they're not going to be out stopping the criminals. They're going to be out writing tickets
[46:26.040 --> 46:31.480]  or your husband might be out working on the car and leave a can open beer in the front.
[46:31.480 --> 46:37.320]  They're going to CPS your kids. You better keep your nose clean, folks. You better understand
[46:37.320 --> 46:44.520]  you're in a prison grid and you better keep your nose so clean. That means keep your nose clean,
[46:44.520 --> 46:47.560]  but at the same time be more vocal and get involved politically and speak out.
[46:47.560 --> 46:53.960]  But at the same time, do that with a very clean nose and realize they've trained the public to
[46:53.960 --> 46:59.720]  be spies, to tattle, to make stuff up, to exaggerate, to do anything they can, carpet cleaners,
[47:01.240 --> 47:05.960]  appliance repair people. A lot of them are on police payroll spying in your house,
[47:05.960 --> 47:09.240]  a tiny grow lamp to grow orchids. That'll get you a SWAT team rate.
[47:11.560 --> 47:16.200]  They're looking. They want money. And the government has said they've had a three fold.
[47:16.200 --> 47:20.840]  You can pull this up increase in the amount of hotline tips for money. That's the new American
[47:20.840 --> 47:28.440]  economy. Look out. Don't just let anybody in your house because they'll make stuff up.
[47:32.680 --> 47:37.560]  You understand that? And it's going to get worse and worse and worse. This is a sick,
[47:37.560 --> 47:50.120]  sick, disgusting, predatory society. All three big Icelandic banks are now nationalized.
[47:51.880 --> 47:55.240]  Interesting story here. Scientist hologram television to become reality.
[47:57.880 --> 48:01.080]  Remember we told you about people on them in Hollywood who talk about James Cameron.
[48:01.080 --> 48:04.280]  The reason he doesn't make many movies these days for over a decade. He's been putting his
[48:04.280 --> 48:12.920]  billions of dollars from Titanic and Terminator into hologram movie theaters, which they've already
[48:12.920 --> 48:20.840]  got designed, hologram TVs, hologram, hologram TV projectors. Amazing.
[48:23.960 --> 48:28.200]  Another headline financial crisis who is going to bail out the euro. Europe must
[48:28.200 --> 48:32.520]  pull together to avoid further financial disaster argues Ambrose Evans Pritchard.
[48:32.520 --> 48:37.400]  And pull together means fully sign everything over to the private banks that engineered all this.
[48:43.080 --> 48:47.080]  All right. I'm going to start your calls after we're done with this Barack Obama piece.
[48:48.520 --> 48:50.520]  I'm going to go ahead and start playing it now. And we're going to come back from
[48:50.520 --> 48:57.240]  break and play the rest of it and comment and do not dare say I'm political with one of these
[48:57.240 --> 49:02.280]  two stage candidates. I'm standing up to anybody that violates the First Amendment and everywhere
[49:02.280 --> 49:06.840]  you see this now. The Barack Obama people, the pro Bush people, they're allowed to have
[49:06.840 --> 49:12.440]  their free speech, but anybody outside the paradigm is shouted down and kicked out or arrested. Here
[49:12.440 --> 49:22.040]  it is. Every terrible mortgage could be paid off with a hundred billion dollars. We just passed
[49:22.040 --> 49:29.640]  a bailout of $700 billion that's backing every kind of derivative paper that's a worthless
[49:29.640 --> 49:37.240]  investment. Look into fractional banking. The Federal Reserve is paying up to America.
[49:37.880 --> 49:43.720]  You can't outpay a threat. What I'm doing is not telling them that this young Obama
[49:45.720 --> 49:55.640]  Why don't you? Hey, Obama and McCain are the same. Obama and McCain are the same.
[49:55.640 --> 49:59.640]  Obama and McCain are the same.
[49:59.640 --> 50:03.640]  Barack Obama will not be the same.
[50:03.640 --> 50:07.640]  We need to change the new party policy.
[50:07.640 --> 50:11.640]  That's going to be my downfall.
[50:11.640 --> 50:15.640]  I don't care about any of you.
[50:15.640 --> 50:19.640]  I understand you're asking me, but I'm not going to stop.
[50:19.640 --> 50:23.640]  We're going to come back and play the rest of this, but when he talks about it,
[50:23.640 --> 50:27.640]  how he has rights, they chant back. We have rights. We have rights.
[50:27.640 --> 50:31.640]  And there's these huge rallies. People everywhere.
[50:31.640 --> 50:35.640]  Other bullhorn signs, people chanting.
[50:35.640 --> 50:39.640]  But if you say, hey, they're both states, they're both bad, Obama people, there's video of it,
[50:39.640 --> 50:45.640]  their faces. Obama and McCain people side by side look like they've seen a vampire or a
[50:45.640 --> 50:49.640]  creature with 14 heads, spewing acid.
[50:49.640 --> 50:53.640]  Because they want a clutch to that.
[50:53.640 --> 50:57.640]  Everything will be all right if they just vote for Obama and McCain.
[50:57.640 --> 51:01.640]  Do you have doubts about the stability of the dollar or your own financial future?
[51:01.640 --> 51:07.640]  Is it is a growth rate or rampant inflation affecting the bottom line of your retirement savings accounts?
[51:07.640 --> 51:12.640]  Do you worry about uncontrollable economic events which could suddenly wipe out some or all of your hard earned savings?
[51:12.640 --> 51:15.640]  You can turn adversity into opportunity.
[51:15.640 --> 51:20.640]  Individual retirement accounts and most 401Ks, 403Bs, CEPs and other retirement plans
[51:20.640 --> 51:24.640]  can be rolled over into self-directed accounts using gold and silver.
[51:24.640 --> 51:29.640]  There are definitely some do's and don'ts with this rollover process and that's where Midas Resources comes in.

[51:40.640 --> 51:45.640]  It's not a question of if you'll need precious metals in your portfolio, it's a question of when.

[51:58.640 --> 52:05.640]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[52:05.640 --> 52:10.640]  The enemy struck America on September 11th, but who is the enemy?
[52:10.640 --> 52:11.640]  bin Laden.
[52:11.640 --> 52:12.640]  This is his ammo.
[52:12.640 --> 52:15.640]  We have to look to the Middle East, we have to look to Osama bin Laden.
[52:15.640 --> 52:22.640]  Fabled enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[52:22.640 --> 52:29.640]  Some US investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the US.
[52:29.640 --> 52:33.640]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[52:33.640 --> 52:40.640]  Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network,
[52:40.640 --> 52:43.640]  warnings in war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[52:43.640 --> 52:44.640]  Fabled enemies.

[53:01.640 --> 53:03.640]  Honey, have you seen my car keys?
[53:03.640 --> 53:05.640]  I can't find my wallet.
[53:05.640 --> 53:06.640]  Sound familiar?

[54:07.640 --> 54:14.640]  Obama's chief will chair police violation of free speech attempts to succinctly explain back her bailout scam.
[54:14.640 --> 54:20.640]  That Obama helped push through, met with mindless bleating.
[54:20.640 --> 54:27.640]  Police kick protestor Benjamin Harms off Belmont University campus this week before the presidential debate.
[54:27.640 --> 54:30.640]  We're going to get him on for the crime of press passing.
[54:30.640 --> 54:37.640]  As hundreds of mindless Obama supporters cheered the outright violation of free speech.
[54:37.640 --> 54:45.640]  The protagonist attempts to succinctly explain the banker bailout scam, which Barack Obama has fully supported,
[54:45.640 --> 54:52.640]  and help you pass through Congress, he was instrumental, in clear and concise terms was met with the mindless bleeding of Obama, Obama, Obama,
[54:52.640 --> 54:57.640]  perfectly underscoring the vacuum of Obama's empty platitudes of change.
[54:57.640 --> 55:04.640]  And the deluded idolatry of his supporters, and I'm sorry it's just a fact and I'm not for McCain folks, I don't get to vote.
[55:04.640 --> 55:07.640]  Okay, most of the country's got scam machines in.
[55:07.640 --> 55:10.640]  These guys are CIA government fronts, period.
[55:10.640 --> 55:21.640]  But Obama is the chosen one, he's gotten three times the Wall Street money that McCain's gotten, and four times the Goldman Sachs money, individually.
[55:21.640 --> 55:28.640]  It's almost 500 grand just from Goldman Sachs, and if you think he's changed, he has changed.
[55:28.640 --> 55:30.640]  Incredible tyrannies coming.
[55:30.640 --> 55:35.640]  Martial law, riots, you name it, it'll probably be Obama,
[55:35.640 --> 55:43.640]  because they can't have some old white guy who's statistically going to die of his cancer pretty soon.
[55:43.640 --> 55:47.640]  They can get a lot more done with Obama, but it doesn't matter, the elite get to vote, not us.
[55:47.640 --> 55:56.640]  They give what they want, and they want to sucker people so that they can sucker the liberals, the inner city folks, everybody into this.
[55:56.640 --> 55:59.640]  There's not a sucker the public didn't see they didn't want.
[55:59.640 --> 56:09.640]  And remember, you don't like the bailout, well, Barack Obama, you can Google Barack Obama instrumental in getting it passed, all those headlines, very proud of himself.
[56:09.640 --> 56:12.640]  Now the black caucus knew what was going on, they said no.
[56:12.640 --> 56:18.640]  Obama came up and twisted enough of their arms to go ahead and be the deciding vote, the Democratic column.
[56:18.640 --> 56:21.640]  Go pull that up for yourself.
[56:21.640 --> 56:23.640]  And what happened after they got it passed?
[56:23.640 --> 56:28.640]  They're bringing those stocks down because those bankers got all that money now and they want to buy that up.
[56:28.640 --> 56:31.640]  They needed to press it so they can buy it.
[56:31.640 --> 56:35.640]  They need to deepen the crisis because then they'll get even more power.
[56:35.640 --> 56:43.640]  Remember, Congress was told by the executive, you do what we say or martial law, let's finish up with this audio, listen to it.
[56:43.640 --> 57:03.640]  I am now being escorted by police away from the state.
[57:03.640 --> 57:28.640]  We have rights, we have rights.
[57:28.640 --> 57:34.640]  You see that? He says I have a right and then they chant we have rights as they take him away.
[57:34.640 --> 57:40.640]  Then the police grab his bullhorn away from him and say, we're not going to charge you with trespassing.
[57:40.640 --> 57:43.640]  That's what our veterans fought and died for.
[57:43.640 --> 57:47.640]  So the police can selectively, and that's how fascism works.
[57:47.640 --> 57:52.640]  It's always the same at the DNC, the RNC, we've covered them all.
[57:52.640 --> 57:56.640]  Whatever the crowd doesn't like, the cops come and take you away.
[57:56.640 --> 58:00.640]  They throw you out, they put you somewhere where nobody can see you.
[58:00.640 --> 58:02.640]  You see, that's how it works. Finish up with it.
[58:02.640 --> 58:08.640]  You don't know what they're telling you if you get an escorted by police off of the premises.
[58:08.640 --> 58:15.640]  This is ridiculous. I have a right to free speech.
[58:15.640 --> 58:19.640]  Constitution violation number one.
[58:19.640 --> 58:23.640]  Constitution violation number one.
[58:23.640 --> 58:26.640]  I mean, am I going to be arrested for trespassing?
[58:26.640 --> 58:29.640]  Yes, you will be. What's going to happen?
[58:29.640 --> 58:31.640]  We're going to write you a citation.
[58:31.640 --> 58:33.640]  Right now?
[58:33.640 --> 58:36.640]  We're going to write you a citation.
[58:36.640 --> 58:40.640]  Here we go. The message is, you're a slave.
[58:40.640 --> 58:49.640]  You are listening to GCN. Visit GCNLive.com today.
[58:49.640 --> 58:54.640]  May I have everybody's attention, please? I've come with a message of information.
[58:54.640 --> 58:56.640]  9-Eleven was an inside job.
[58:56.640 --> 58:59.640]  Do you like being a puppet, sir? Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[58:59.640 --> 59:02.640]  I'll do the American people know that 9-Eleven was a stage.
[59:02.640 --> 59:07.640]  It was engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the fallout or commission, the CAFAR.
[59:07.640 --> 59:15.640]  The day that we stop asking questions is the day that we have allowed the seeds of despotism to grow at our own door.
[59:15.640 --> 59:21.640]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11, a global awakening has taken place.
[59:21.640 --> 59:25.640]  An inside job? How dare you?
[59:25.640 --> 59:31.640]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[59:31.640 --> 59:34.640]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[59:34.640 --> 59:40.640]  And if the government has not told the Trump in five years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of 9-Eleven.
[59:40.640 --> 59:46.640]  Please rise and download the film at prisonplanet.tv right now or get the DVD at infowars.com.
[59:46.640 --> 1:00:11.640]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[1:00:16.640 --> 1:00:28.640]  Live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[1:00:28.640 --> 1:00:33.640]  I'm sure somebody saw this on the national news.
[1:00:33.640 --> 1:00:38.640]  I've seen reports all over the place about wherever Obama goes or Mckangos that confronted about the New World Order.
[1:00:38.640 --> 1:00:40.640]  We've seen many videos of that.
[1:00:40.640 --> 1:00:46.640]  Mark in Indiana says he went to the state fairgrounds at a midnight rally.
[1:00:46.640 --> 1:00:50.640]  Perfect for mind control with Lord Obama, who we were just covering.
[1:00:50.640 --> 1:00:55.640]  You can be pro Mckain or pro Obama at these university events, but if you start speaking out against the bailout,
[1:00:55.640 --> 1:01:02.640]  the police grab you, take you out and then charge you with trespassing or cite you.
[1:01:02.640 --> 1:01:04.640]  Just amazing.
[1:01:04.640 --> 1:01:06.640]  And then the Obamanoids and others chant and love it.
[1:01:06.640 --> 1:01:10.640]  They're one of the Mckain people. They support it when you're drug away and they celebrate the attack on the First Amendment.
[1:01:10.640 --> 1:01:13.640]  We've had them pull out knives and cut our equipment, slash things.
[1:01:13.640 --> 1:01:14.640]  It's all in video.
[1:01:14.640 --> 1:01:17.640]  And the police right in front of cops, they can pull knives out. It's no problem.
[1:01:17.640 --> 1:01:19.640]  You know, attacking people with knives is no big deal.
[1:01:19.640 --> 1:01:21.640]  But we're going to go to your calls.
[1:01:21.640 --> 1:01:22.640]  Come up in the next segment.
[1:01:22.640 --> 1:01:27.640]  Mark is in Indiana and he said that he had a chance to confront Obama,
[1:01:27.640 --> 1:01:30.640]  started calling for his New World Order and Mark said no New World Order.
[1:01:30.640 --> 1:01:32.640]  So break it down for us.
[1:01:32.640 --> 1:01:34.640]  Mark in Indiana, what happened?
[1:01:34.640 --> 1:01:37.640]  All right, well, first of all, it wasn't a midnight rally.
[1:01:37.640 --> 1:01:40.640]  I heard about it midnight the night before. It was at 10 o'clock in the morning rally.
[1:01:40.640 --> 1:01:43.640]  Okay, I misunderstood you when you were telling me real quick off air.
[1:01:43.640 --> 1:01:46.640]  Okay, so you heard about it at midnight. It was 10 o'clock in the morning. Go ahead.
[1:01:46.640 --> 1:01:51.640]  Okay, so I show up there, you know, and I'm telling people about it. It's a long line.
[1:01:51.640 --> 1:01:54.640]  I'm telling everyone about, you know, the 93 World Trade Center bombing,
[1:01:54.640 --> 1:01:56.640]  telling them, you know, screaming about it.
[1:01:56.640 --> 1:01:59.640]  You're like, how can you know that the CIA didn't hire the terrorists again on 9-11?
[1:01:59.640 --> 1:02:00.640]  You know, letting people know.
[1:02:00.640 --> 1:02:02.640]  And this little black lady said, come talk to me.
[1:02:02.640 --> 1:02:04.640]  You know, she wanted to hear all about it. So I cut in front of the line.
[1:02:04.640 --> 1:02:07.640]  So I cut in earlier than everyone else.
[1:02:07.640 --> 1:02:10.640]  But it was a free event, too.
[1:02:10.640 --> 1:02:14.640]  And so when Obama started speaking, you know, right at the beginning of speech,
[1:02:14.640 --> 1:02:17.640]  right out of the gate, he said, we have a global economic problem.
[1:02:17.640 --> 1:02:20.640]  So we need a global structure.
[1:02:20.640 --> 1:02:23.640]  And as soon as he said that, he started tripping over his words.
[1:02:23.640 --> 1:02:28.640]  And I immediately said, no New World Order! You will not have a New World Order!
[1:02:28.640 --> 1:02:32.640]  I was just, no, I wasn't inside job! Just really giving it to him. You know, just really going off.
[1:02:32.640 --> 1:02:36.640]  And I was dragged off by these three police that were right there,
[1:02:36.640 --> 1:02:40.640]  and then to a welcoming committee of, you know, a dozen or more state troopers.
[1:02:40.640 --> 1:02:44.640]  And they twisted my arm the whole nine yards and threw me out.
[1:02:44.640 --> 1:02:46.640]  But no charges were filed, which is good news.
[1:02:46.640 --> 1:02:48.640]  And the second part of the story is...
[1:02:48.640 --> 1:02:51.640]  Yeah, you're lucky you weren't murdered where they all stand around laughing,
[1:02:51.640 --> 1:02:54.640]  like six of them tazering and tazering until you died.
[1:02:54.640 --> 1:02:57.640]  Oh, there were 20,000 people at this event, Alex.
[1:02:57.640 --> 1:03:01.640]  There were so many people here. It was ridiculous.
[1:03:01.640 --> 1:03:05.640]  But we have open torture, open cruel and unusual punishment without trial.
[1:03:05.640 --> 1:03:08.640]  Electroshock with cattle prods is what it is.
[1:03:08.640 --> 1:03:12.640]  You know, we hear about the Nazis and cattle prods, now they do it to us and it's loving.
[1:03:12.640 --> 1:03:16.640]  So were these guys proud of attacking the First Amendment?
[1:03:16.640 --> 1:03:19.640]  Oh, yeah, no, they were twisting my arm. I thought they were going to break it.
[1:03:19.640 --> 1:03:23.640]  So I was saying, I'll go peacefully, I'll go peacefully, you know, when they were twisting my arm.
[1:03:23.640 --> 1:03:27.640]  Oh, that's the thing, when they were pulling me out, some guy was yelling,
[1:03:27.640 --> 1:03:31.640]  Tazem, Tazem, you know, like, totally, totally, totally.
[1:03:31.640 --> 1:03:35.640]  See, the neurons in the brain with the neural pathways,
[1:03:35.640 --> 1:03:40.640]  the average person has seen several million simulated or real murders on TV.
[1:03:40.640 --> 1:03:43.640]  It becomes a thing of entertainment and enjoyment.
[1:03:43.640 --> 1:03:47.640]  And so that's why they only get upset about Marines killing dogs,
[1:03:47.640 --> 1:03:49.640]  not Marines gunning down Iraqi children for fun.
[1:03:49.640 --> 1:03:53.640]  So people laugh at the dead children, they get upset by a puppy.
[1:03:53.640 --> 1:03:57.640]  And so, see, the public has seen the attack over and over again, so they want it.
[1:03:57.640 --> 1:04:04.640]  It's gladiatorial. The gladiatorial events are meant to condition the public to want to be hurt.
[1:04:04.640 --> 1:04:08.640]  So the slaves were calling for you to be tortured, not just grabbed.
[1:04:08.640 --> 1:04:11.640]  Certainly. Oh, yeah, absolutely.
[1:04:11.640 --> 1:04:16.640]  But here's the thing, so they kicked me out, it was a whole big thing, but that was a minor victory for the day.
[1:04:16.640 --> 1:04:21.640]  I went home to see if somehow one of your people saw that and caught that and put it online,
[1:04:21.640 --> 1:04:23.640]  you know, immediately I wanted to research it.
[1:04:23.640 --> 1:04:30.640]  And then I saw that Gibson from Good Morning America was doing a live broadcast, 6.30, in downtown Indianapolis.
[1:04:30.640 --> 1:04:32.640]  So what did I do?
[1:04:32.640 --> 1:04:36.640]  Immediately, I went down there to the St. Clair Bridge.
[1:04:36.640 --> 1:04:38.640]  I want to hear more. Exactly. You didn't stop.
[1:04:38.640 --> 1:04:42.640]  The key to these operations with even one man is in an hour,
[1:04:42.640 --> 1:04:46.640]  so you can go hit three or four points where they want to make it look like the public's included
[1:04:46.640 --> 1:04:51.640]  with that mass psychology that triggers a tribal mechanism to see fellow slaves.
[1:04:51.640 --> 1:04:56.640]  By the way, McCain just talked about how we're all slaves on the TV the other day. He slipped up.
[1:04:56.640 --> 1:04:58.640]  Here we go. Stay with us.
[1:04:58.640 --> 1:05:02.640]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history,
[1:05:02.640 --> 1:05:05.640]  a terrorist act of war against this country.
[1:05:05.640 --> 1:05:08.640]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[1:05:08.640 --> 1:05:10.640]  But who is the enemy?
[1:05:10.640 --> 1:05:12.640]  Ben Laden. This is his ammo.
[1:05:12.640 --> 1:05:15.640]  We have to look to the Middle East. We have to look to Osama Ben Laden.
[1:05:15.640 --> 1:05:22.640]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[1:05:22.640 --> 1:05:29.640]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis, again, very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[1:05:29.640 --> 1:05:33.640]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[1:05:33.640 --> 1:05:40.640]  Ben Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers' ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network,
[1:05:40.640 --> 1:05:44.640]  warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more. Fabled Enemies.

[1:07:07.640 --> 1:07:12.640]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate and others are absorbed into the skin.

[1:08:08.640 --> 1:08:10.640]  You want answers?
[1:08:10.640 --> 1:08:11.640]  Well so do he.
[1:08:11.640 --> 1:08:15.640]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[1:08:15.640 --> 1:08:21.640]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[1:08:21.640 --> 1:08:28.640]  I want to go to Scott, Michael, John, Rebecca, Mike, and others, open phones at 800-259-9231,
[1:08:28.640 --> 1:08:35.920]  finishing up with Market Indiana, so he went down with an Obama rally that was in the fairgrounds
[1:08:35.920 --> 1:08:40.440]  10 a.m. in the morning, Obama, as he's been giving speeches, as every major financial
[1:08:40.440 --> 1:08:44.920]  paper is called for a new world order run by the private banks, you will pay carbon taxes
[1:08:44.920 --> 1:08:45.920]  to them.
[1:08:45.920 --> 1:08:48.960]  We told you years ago this would be done, I've imploded things, exactly what we said
[1:08:48.960 --> 1:08:56.240]  is happening, and I keep repeating that because listen to us, these criminals are public, yes
[1:08:56.240 --> 1:09:02.720]  they own Obama, yes they own McCain, Obama isn't going to save you, he's going to get
[1:09:02.720 --> 1:09:08.480]  more gas mileage for the new world order, he's a good front for them.
[1:09:08.480 --> 1:09:12.760]  And so next you learn that they've got a national TV show going on in the morning still, so
[1:09:12.760 --> 1:09:15.400]  you run down there, Mark, continue.
[1:09:15.400 --> 1:09:19.120]  Do we have Mark, John?
[1:09:19.120 --> 1:09:20.120]  In Indiana?
[1:09:20.120 --> 1:09:21.120]  Yeah, this is Mark in Indiana.
[1:09:21.120 --> 1:09:22.920]  Okay, go ahead and finish your story.
[1:09:22.920 --> 1:09:27.840]  Okay, yeah, so I get there and the cops turn me away, so I drive around to the other side
[1:09:27.840 --> 1:09:32.280]  of the bridge where I find about 40 civilians standing, 40 people standing.
[1:09:32.280 --> 1:09:36.000]  Civilians, again, the police and military call us civilians, mayor call us civilians because
[1:09:36.000 --> 1:09:40.080]  we're under martial law, officially, Congress has been told that, they've introduced that
[1:09:40.080 --> 1:09:44.720]  into our nomenclature, why were you the slave scum who's only there to pay money to the
[1:09:44.720 --> 1:09:51.920]  government to give to private banks, why were you a slave worm trying to use the bridge
[1:09:51.920 --> 1:09:52.920]  you paid for?
[1:09:52.920 --> 1:09:53.920]  Right, exactly.
[1:09:53.920 --> 1:09:59.120]  Tell me as a slave, as a fellow, slave worm, why?
[1:09:59.120 --> 1:10:05.120]  I'm not a worm, Alex, I'm not that, I'm a human being with rights and determination,
[1:10:05.120 --> 1:10:06.960]  put here by God.
[1:10:06.960 --> 1:10:11.080]  Nope, slave worm, you're lucky governments there, you want to worship it, you want to
[1:10:11.080 --> 1:10:12.080]  thank it.
[1:10:12.080 --> 1:10:15.560]  So tell me, why did they turn you away as a slave worm civilian?
[1:10:15.560 --> 1:10:20.320]  Well, I don't know why, but I found another way, I went around to the other side and I
[1:10:20.320 --> 1:10:24.360]  found all these people standing there waiting for the broadcast, the live broadcast that
[1:10:24.360 --> 1:10:29.200]  Charlie Gibson was about to give to the nightly news and I let him talk for a long time, I
[1:10:29.200 --> 1:10:34.400]  let Charlie Gibson just let him do his thing, waited for it and I snuck my way to the front.
[1:10:34.400 --> 1:10:40.600]  I got right behind the TV cameras, lit a cigarette, I saw the smoke hit his face, I was so close,
[1:10:40.600 --> 1:10:46.080]  Charlie Gibson could smell my cigarette and so I'm just waiting for it and there's a female
[1:10:46.080 --> 1:10:49.280]  cop right behind me and I look around and look at her and she looks at me and kind of
[1:10:49.280 --> 1:10:51.760]  cute, like she's a cute cop.
[1:10:51.760 --> 1:10:59.520]  All right, that's enough, I'm about to go for him, so I'm right behind the cameras and
[1:10:59.520 --> 1:11:03.360]  I just went and Charlie Gibson says, we're going to go to blah, blah, blah, back in New
[1:11:03.360 --> 1:11:06.840]  York or whatever and he goes to a split screen with what my friend told me and right then
[1:11:06.840 --> 1:11:15.960]  I go, my wife's an inside job, no new owner, just felt it out again and there was a man
[1:11:15.960 --> 1:11:20.280]  cop and a woman cop and they both grabbed me and are covering my mouth and just dragging
[1:11:20.280 --> 1:11:21.280]  me away.
[1:11:21.280 --> 1:11:26.040]  Now again, let's stop, they pose outside like it's supposedly to here and if you want to
[1:11:26.040 --> 1:11:30.360]  chant for McCain or Obama, you're allowed to but even if you have a Ron Paul sign over
[1:11:30.360 --> 1:11:33.280]  and over again or a nader, they come and grab them.
[1:11:33.280 --> 1:11:39.920]  They instinctively know anything outside the political or correct left-right paradigm
[1:11:39.920 --> 1:11:40.920]  is not allowed.
[1:11:40.920 --> 1:11:45.160]  So you're up against the fence, you're a few feet from them, you shout.
[1:11:45.160 --> 1:11:51.680]  Now others of course are, let me guess, waving legalized marijuana signs and all this stuff
[1:11:51.680 --> 1:11:58.880]  and Barack Obama signs but you weren't allowed, were you?
[1:11:58.880 --> 1:12:01.000]  Because you're an evil slave worm.
[1:12:01.000 --> 1:12:07.840]  Now tell me what the gods, who selectively decide what speech is okay, tell me when they
[1:12:07.840 --> 1:12:09.160]  grab you what they did.
[1:12:09.160 --> 1:12:14.040]  Now I want you to talk about them as worshipful masters.
[1:12:14.040 --> 1:12:16.760]  When you talk about them, you say because you're like, ah!
[1:12:16.760 --> 1:12:20.080]  When you talk about a god, you address it as a deity.
[1:12:20.080 --> 1:12:24.880]  What did the deities in the uniforms of Saturn, that's what they wear, what did the deities
[1:12:24.880 --> 1:12:25.880]  say to you?
[1:12:25.880 --> 1:12:31.480]  They said we know, they said the cops know, the cops said we know 9-11 was an inside job,
[1:12:31.480 --> 1:12:32.480]  they know.
[1:12:32.480 --> 1:12:36.520]  Oh but still, so they know, but you're not allowed to have your free speech.
[1:12:36.520 --> 1:12:37.520]  Right, right.
[1:12:37.520 --> 1:12:40.520]  It sounds like they'd already been given orders.
[1:12:40.520 --> 1:12:41.520]  Ah.
[1:12:41.520 --> 1:12:42.520]  Well exactly.
[1:12:42.520 --> 1:12:44.520]  They can't have, they can't have an alternative.
[1:12:44.520 --> 1:12:48.960]  Did you ask them why are all these left-right idiots, McCain and Obama supporters allowed
[1:12:48.960 --> 1:12:51.160]  to go on screen but I'm not allowed?
[1:12:51.160 --> 1:12:57.160]  Well, I mean it's not obvious, that answer, the question answers itself, Alex.
[1:12:57.160 --> 1:12:59.160]  So what did you say to them?
[1:12:59.160 --> 1:13:04.160]  I said, they were driving me away and they were like, I was like, I said, well, did you
[1:13:04.160 --> 1:13:05.160]  know that?
[1:13:05.160 --> 1:13:06.160]  And the cops said, yeah, we know.
[1:13:06.160 --> 1:13:08.040]  I was like, well, the people need to hear that.
[1:13:08.040 --> 1:13:10.360]  And a million of Americans just heard that.
[1:13:10.360 --> 1:13:11.360]  You know?
[1:13:11.360 --> 1:13:20.480]  Did you ask the lords, the gods from heaven, the leaders, I mean did you ask them why everywhere
[1:13:20.480 --> 1:13:23.480]  you go, your speech specifically isn't allowed.
[1:13:23.480 --> 1:13:29.160]  There's only one God, Alex, and there's a, and we can't forget that.
[1:13:29.160 --> 1:13:31.240]  Yeah, and that's the police.
[1:13:31.240 --> 1:13:32.240]  That's the only God.
[1:13:32.240 --> 1:13:33.240]  Oh, well not.
[1:13:33.240 --> 1:13:36.400]  The only God is Henry Paulson and you will bow.
[1:13:36.400 --> 1:13:42.520]  I'm being sarcastic and I shouldn't be, I mean, I'm illustrating they are not God,
[1:13:42.520 --> 1:13:43.520]  they are not our king.
[1:13:43.520 --> 1:13:46.360]  But listen, it's happened to me, man, I've experienced it.
[1:13:46.360 --> 1:13:51.240]  Why is only our speech not allowed, but everybody else's, see, this is pure garbage.
[1:13:51.240 --> 1:13:53.880]  I mean, what does it say to them?
[1:13:53.880 --> 1:13:57.400]  You said it last night that the truth is uncomfortable is why.
[1:13:57.400 --> 1:13:58.400]  That's all.
[1:13:58.400 --> 1:14:02.280]  It's just, the truth is very uncomfortable and the whole of this information is...
[1:14:02.280 --> 1:14:03.280]  You know what's uncomfortable?
[1:14:03.280 --> 1:14:06.520]  These people carried out the attacks and they're carrying out the financial attack and none
[1:14:06.520 --> 1:14:07.840]  of us have a future.
[1:14:07.840 --> 1:14:12.120]  And shame on the police everywhere in this country, trying to violate the First Amendment.
[1:14:12.120 --> 1:14:15.600]  They're just trying to keep their jobs, though, I mean, that's a problem.
[1:14:15.600 --> 1:14:20.360]  But how do they, have they all been told if you hear 9-11 truth or anything outside the
[1:14:20.360 --> 1:14:24.720]  left-right paradigm, don't let them, I mean, the news comes out to claim they're out there
[1:14:24.720 --> 1:14:25.920]  for the media.
[1:14:25.920 --> 1:14:28.840]  You're not even with a bullhorn, you yell something and they grab you.
[1:14:28.840 --> 1:14:31.880]  When everybody else screams at the top of their lungs, why?
[1:14:31.880 --> 1:14:32.880]  Why?
[1:14:32.880 --> 1:14:36.920]  There's no rules walking up on the side of the city street to the edge of a live broadcast.
[1:14:36.920 --> 1:14:38.640]  You're allowed to do that.
[1:14:38.640 --> 1:14:40.840]  This isn't the Soviet Union.
[1:14:40.840 --> 1:14:43.480]  Well, you know that's the thing.
[1:14:43.480 --> 1:14:44.480]  It's so un-American.
[1:14:44.480 --> 1:14:47.640]  They didn't arrest me, it was a report, my friend told me he was watching it.
[1:14:47.640 --> 1:14:49.840]  Oh, you're so lucky they didn't taser you to death.
[1:14:49.840 --> 1:14:54.480]  Like they don't taze me, bro, we ask about skull and bones, so they taze him.
[1:14:54.480 --> 1:14:55.480]  Right.
[1:14:55.480 --> 1:14:59.240]  But my friend said the screen said, hey, let me just tell the cops this, hey, you serve
[1:14:59.240 --> 1:15:02.680]  the system, they're going to take your pension funds, keep drinking the water, keep giving
[1:15:02.680 --> 1:15:05.880]  your kids the shots, just keep serving evil.
[1:15:05.880 --> 1:15:06.880]  Shame on them.
[1:15:06.880 --> 1:15:12.120]  Now, now, now we're the cops being smart mouth when they said, yeah, we know we said it.
[1:15:12.120 --> 1:15:15.200]  They were very corrupt, cooperative, and they kept saying, well, very cooperative as they
[1:15:15.200 --> 1:15:16.200]  valid your rights.
[1:15:16.200 --> 1:15:19.680]  But I mean, were they being smart mouth when they said, we know, sir, we know the aliens
[1:15:19.680 --> 1:15:21.800]  are real, we know the transmitters are in your brain.
[1:15:21.800 --> 1:15:27.000]  No, no, no, I didn't, I didn't sense any sarcasm at all because I talked to police wherever
[1:15:27.000 --> 1:15:28.000]  I go.
[1:15:28.000 --> 1:15:29.000]  I talked to all kinds of people everywhere.
[1:15:29.000 --> 1:15:32.840]  No, no, we've had cops all over, give us thumbs up to 9-11's an inside job, but you
[1:15:32.840 --> 1:15:36.880]  know, I mean, I had a bunch of LAPD detectives and they were all, I mean, I had dinner with
[1:15:36.880 --> 1:15:39.800]  them and they said, of course we know it's inside job, but the point is, anybody have
[1:15:39.800 --> 1:15:40.800]  a brain does.
[1:15:40.800 --> 1:15:44.080]  The point is, how do they know that, but they still come grab you?
[1:15:44.080 --> 1:15:50.920]  I mean, I got, I got to hand it to the Denver police are the only ones I've ever run into
[1:15:50.920 --> 1:15:53.000]  that actually knew what the First Amendment was.
[1:15:53.000 --> 1:15:56.320]  Now they did let people attack us and punch us, but I kind of liked that.
[1:15:56.320 --> 1:16:00.080]  I kind of liked that they just stood back.
[1:16:00.080 --> 1:16:01.080]  That's crazy.
[1:16:01.080 --> 1:16:02.080]  Yeah.
[1:16:02.080 --> 1:16:03.080]  It's unbelievable.
[1:16:03.080 --> 1:16:07.280]  It's, it's crazy than any sci-fi movie I've seen.
[1:16:07.280 --> 1:16:10.000]  It's, it's so, so, so, so how did this end?
[1:16:10.000 --> 1:16:15.920]  It ended with, like, oh, the local news came up and it was like video taping them, pat me
[1:16:15.920 --> 1:16:17.920]  down and they'll keep your hands on your pocket, you know, that whole thing.
[1:16:17.920 --> 1:16:20.680]  And they used that for, see, there's terrorists on the streets, a lot of danger.
[1:16:20.680 --> 1:16:23.320]  The police are dealing with the evil people that speak their mind.
[1:16:23.320 --> 1:16:26.240]  Don't worry, the First Amendment's being stopped, we're selectively regulating what
[1:16:26.240 --> 1:16:29.800]  you can and can't say, it's America, that's what it's all about, liberty and freedom.
[1:16:29.800 --> 1:16:30.800]  Right.
[1:16:30.800 --> 1:16:31.800]  It's totally bizarre.
[1:16:31.800 --> 1:16:32.800]  What did the local news say?
[1:16:32.800 --> 1:16:33.800]  Here we had an al-Qaeda operative.
[1:16:33.800 --> 1:16:38.800]  Well, I said, if you want to do an interview with me, I'll keep it real tame, you know?
[1:16:38.800 --> 1:16:42.520]  I said, I'll keep it tame, I won't, I won't go too deep into it, just give me a short
[1:16:42.520 --> 1:16:43.520]  interview.
[1:16:43.520 --> 1:16:46.400]  And they said, no, we've already gotten the image we want as an evil American.
[1:16:46.400 --> 1:16:47.400]  Right.
[1:16:47.400 --> 1:16:48.400]  Right, exactly.
[1:16:48.400 --> 1:16:49.400]  Exactly.
[1:16:49.400 --> 1:16:52.400]  We just want the image of cops good, civilian slave.
[1:16:52.400 --> 1:16:57.000]  This guy said something, he's got half a brain, you get him.
[1:16:57.000 --> 1:17:01.800]  Oh my God, he knows how to read, arrest him, huh, he's reading a magazine.
[1:17:01.800 --> 1:17:08.400]  No, um, so, so, so, so, we were thankful, thank you for not tasering me, thank you for not
[1:17:08.400 --> 1:17:12.000]  arresting me, you only selectively violated the First Amendment.
[1:17:12.000 --> 1:17:15.680]  It'd be bad enough if you didn't let anyone have free speech, but it's selective, that's
[1:17:15.680 --> 1:17:17.200]  even more fascist.
[1:17:17.200 --> 1:17:19.400]  Thank you for destroying America.
[1:17:19.400 --> 1:17:24.240]  Oh, thank you, I mean, cops, do you think you're safe when you've got a government
[1:17:24.240 --> 1:17:28.040]  that carries out terror attacks and they've got you out violating the, I had Austin cops
[1:17:28.040 --> 1:17:32.640]  come up to me, we're on the sidewalk, bullhorning Perry, and they come over and I said, and
[1:17:32.640 --> 1:17:35.080]  they said, we're going to arrest you if you don't stop, and I said, you guys just lost
[1:17:35.080 --> 1:17:36.720]  a bunch of lawsuits.
[1:17:36.720 --> 1:17:40.880]  I said, don't do it, and they pulled up the riot gear, they said, we're arresting you
[1:17:40.880 --> 1:17:44.120]  five minutes, and I said, go ahead, that's where the bullhorn in the cops, I said, I'm
[1:17:44.120 --> 1:17:48.360]  going, we're going to have to sue you, you've been losing suits, and I saw the cops argue
[1:17:48.360 --> 1:17:53.480]  with each other, and then a captain shows up, and then they all, and then he comes to
[1:17:53.480 --> 1:17:57.720]  Alex, just go, and I said, no, that video's on the web, and I scream at him, and then
[1:17:57.720 --> 1:18:00.800]  they leave, but the point is, and a lot of cities, they just tasered me to death, they
[1:18:00.800 --> 1:18:05.360]  wouldn't have known who I was, the cops, and again, they were out there trying to stop
[1:18:05.360 --> 1:18:10.920]  my First Amendment, that's what makes this country, this country, what is your problem?
[1:18:10.920 --> 1:18:13.840]  What is it you don't get through your head?
[1:18:13.840 --> 1:18:19.600]  You are involved in tyranny and crime, when you selectively attack the First Amendment,
[1:18:19.600 --> 1:18:23.720]  do you got me, do you get it through your head?
[1:18:23.720 --> 1:18:28.200]  None of us are safe when we don't have a First Amendment, you idiots, those checks and balances
[1:18:28.200 --> 1:18:32.800]  are there to protect you, as well as us, don't you get it?
[1:18:32.800 --> 1:18:33.800]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[1:18:33.800 --> 1:18:40.760]  No, that's how I feel on the inside, Alex, but that's just the thing, you have to keep
[1:18:40.760 --> 1:18:45.200]  your head held high, and remember that truth and goodness will prevail.
[1:18:45.200 --> 1:18:46.680]  How did all this end?
[1:18:46.680 --> 1:18:48.360]  How did all this end?
[1:18:48.360 --> 1:18:53.920]  With the walking away, and the local news wanted to see, wanted a picture of the cops
[1:18:53.920 --> 1:18:56.240]  walking me out across the bay.
[1:18:56.240 --> 1:19:01.520]  Yeah, that image of a travelmaker who spoke was taken away, and again, that's all part
[1:19:01.520 --> 1:19:04.840]  of the image, everywhere, I see I knew how it would end, it's the same template, of
[1:19:04.840 --> 1:19:08.720]  course the producers don't even know why they've been told to do this piece by the IRFs, that's
[1:19:08.720 --> 1:19:12.640]  to show the image of don't come out, don't protest, it's not allowed, you get tasered,
[1:19:12.640 --> 1:19:16.680]  you get arrested, you get run over, don't come out, don't come out, stay in your homes,
[1:19:16.680 --> 1:19:20.960]  you're not allowed to come out, you're not allowed, and then cops see that and habitualizes
[1:19:20.960 --> 1:19:21.960]  that it's all normal.
[1:19:21.960 --> 1:19:25.920]  Right, that's the way it should be, but here's the thing, I was joking with the cops and
[1:19:25.920 --> 1:19:30.040]  smiling and laughing and they were smiling, and to not give them that image, to not let
[1:19:30.040 --> 1:19:31.040]  them have that.
[1:19:31.040 --> 1:19:33.040]  I was talking with them, smiling and laughing.
[1:19:33.040 --> 1:19:38.040]  Did you get the girl's number?
[1:19:38.040 --> 1:19:40.560]  Well done, Lord Vader.
[1:19:40.560 --> 1:19:44.760]  All right, listen, I appreciate your call, you've done well, Mark, I appreciate it.
[1:19:44.760 --> 1:19:49.120]  All right, we'll be back and I promise we're going to write to Scott, Michael, John, Rebecca,

[1:19:59.600 --> 1:20:03.640]  Our beloved republic is on her knees, the forces of globalism are destroying national
[1:20:03.640 --> 1:20:07.600]  sovereignty worldwide, but in Liberty's darkest hour there is hope.
[1:20:07.600 --> 1:20:11.240]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up, it is essential
[1:20:11.240 --> 1:20:15.360]  that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order
[1:20:15.360 --> 1:20:16.360]  master plan.
[1:20:16.360 --> 1:20:20.640]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[1:20:20.640 --> 1:20:26.000]  In the Info War, prisonplanet.tv is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.

[1:20:59.000 --> 1:21:04.200]  It is now time to reign in evil and bring them to justice.
[1:21:04.200 --> 1:21:09.120]  Through the authority that has been delegated to us, it is time to destroy the destroyers.
[1:21:09.120 --> 1:21:13.800]  The number of the mounted troops was 200 million, the vast majority of the population of the
[1:21:13.800 --> 1:21:14.800]  US.
[1:21:14.800 --> 1:21:18.520]  Though the people of the US, where their numbers and influence are strongest, have primary
[1:21:18.520 --> 1:21:23.360]  responsibility for reigning the men and bringing them to justice, all nations will participate
[1:21:23.360 --> 1:21:25.600]  since they reside the world over.
[1:21:25.600 --> 1:21:30.000]  They are called Illuminati, elite, opponents of the New World Order.
[1:21:30.000 --> 1:21:32.760]  They oppose everything that is God and truth.
[1:21:32.760 --> 1:21:37.280]  They are of the line that was disinherited 2,000 years ago, everything they have built
[1:21:37.280 --> 1:21:41.960]  over the centuries, the wealth they have accumulated, the power they have established, the poisoning
[1:21:41.960 --> 1:21:46.960]  of the masses, the destruction of the earth and mankind, we will undo through the authority
[1:21:46.960 --> 1:21:49.520]  that has now been delegated to us.

[1:21:59.880 --> 1:22:03.200]  Would you walk around with your credit card number displayed on your back for anyone to
[1:22:03.200 --> 1:22:04.200]  read?
[1:22:04.200 --> 1:22:05.200]  Of course not.
[1:22:05.200 --> 1:22:08.920]  But if you have one of the 50 million new contactless credit and debit cards in circulation
[1:22:08.920 --> 1:22:11.560]  in your wallet, that's exactly what you're doing.

[1:22:17.060 --> 1:22:20.560]  You may not even realize you already have one of these cards because they look physically
[1:22:20.560 --> 1:22:22.240]  just like the old card.
[1:22:22.240 --> 1:22:26.400]  The difference is an RFID chip hidden inside the card that makes radio communication with
[1:22:26.400 --> 1:22:31.180]  the card possible, right through your wallet, purse or pants pocket without you ever removing
[1:22:31.180 --> 1:22:32.180]  the card.

[1:24:07.120 --> 1:24:08.120]  Go ahead.
[1:24:08.120 --> 1:24:09.120]  Hey Alex.
[1:24:09.120 --> 1:24:10.120]  Hi.
[1:24:10.120 --> 1:24:13.040]  I wanted to ask you about one of the documents.
[1:24:13.040 --> 1:24:17.440]  I didn't get the chance to hear yesterday's show, but I saw something about the conflict
[1:24:17.440 --> 1:24:19.400]  and revolution document.
[1:24:19.400 --> 1:24:25.520]  Do you comment on that a little bit and can you give me some more information on that?
[1:24:25.520 --> 1:24:26.520]  What specific document?
[1:24:26.520 --> 1:24:28.880]  To see in our document.
[1:24:28.880 --> 1:24:30.880]  It was under FEMA.
[1:24:30.880 --> 1:24:34.160]  It was a good document that I saw on there, it said conflict and revolution.
[1:24:34.160 --> 1:24:36.360]  Oh, you're talking about Colonel Alexander.
[1:24:36.360 --> 1:24:37.880]  Is that what it was?
[1:24:37.880 --> 1:24:39.200]  Yeah, I don't know a lot about it.
[1:24:39.200 --> 1:24:42.280]  I just saw some of the information on it.
[1:24:42.280 --> 1:24:49.920]  Well, you have to give me the specific name of what you speak, but I mean every major
[1:24:49.920 --> 1:24:53.720]  Pentagon document, British government documents, they admit it's all about the elite waging
[1:24:53.720 --> 1:24:58.920]  war with the people, suppressing the people, dominating the people, controlling populations.
[1:24:58.920 --> 1:25:03.840]  Yeah, this was about basically saying it's either going to be a conflict that happens
[1:25:03.840 --> 1:25:08.040]  here, that's coming up, that they're preparing for it, and it's a document that was passed
[1:25:08.040 --> 1:25:14.320]  around Congress, and that basically a few of them saw that, and it's either conflict
[1:25:14.320 --> 1:25:17.880]  or revolution that they're preparing for, it's either going to go either way.
[1:25:17.880 --> 1:25:22.840]  Well, I mean that's in PDD 51, that's in the John Warner Defense Authorization Act, that's
[1:25:22.840 --> 1:25:26.040]  in the Army Times, they say they're getting ready for riots in England and the United
[1:25:26.040 --> 1:25:27.040]  States.
[1:25:27.040 --> 1:25:32.520]  Okay, yeah, there was some document it's called conflict and revolution, I believe, to see
[1:25:32.520 --> 1:25:36.560]  in our document, and that's what it was labeled, and I thought I saw that on your site.
[1:25:36.560 --> 1:25:40.000]  Well, there's a lot of those documents, sir, we post a lot of stuff that I'm not even aware
[1:25:40.000 --> 1:25:41.000]  of.
[1:25:41.000 --> 1:25:42.000]  Okay.
[1:25:42.000 --> 1:25:46.360]  All right, Alex, I just wanted to find out if you can do any more about that.
[1:25:46.360 --> 1:25:48.080]  Thank you, I appreciate your call.
[1:25:48.080 --> 1:25:55.160]  Let's go ahead now, and let's go ahead and go to another caller here.
[1:25:55.160 --> 1:25:58.360]  Let's talk to Michael in Canada, you're on the air.
[1:25:58.360 --> 1:26:00.360]  Alex, how you doing?
[1:26:00.360 --> 1:26:01.360]  Good.
[1:26:01.360 --> 1:26:04.520]  Listen, I just wanted to say a couple of things to you.
[1:26:04.520 --> 1:26:13.080]  First of all, thank you so much for waking me up, I just couldn't fathom, I knew there
[1:26:13.080 --> 1:26:17.440]  was something weird about 9-11, but when I finally, a friend of mine who actually lives
[1:26:17.440 --> 1:26:23.720]  in the US, referred me to your site, and I started to sort of get into the issues, and
[1:26:23.720 --> 1:26:28.680]  I've watched all your movies, and then over the last three months, I've just, I tell you
[1:26:28.680 --> 1:26:32.400]  the truth, I'm just completely blown away.
[1:26:32.400 --> 1:26:38.040]  It absolutely shocked me, and as I've, you know, I'm a bit of a historian myself, so
[1:26:38.040 --> 1:26:42.400]  some of the stuff I knew, and I just forgotten, I was an international relations student at
[1:26:42.400 --> 1:26:43.400]  university.
[1:26:43.400 --> 1:26:46.960]  Well, that's it, it's in all the history books, it's taught in political science that
[1:26:46.960 --> 1:26:50.920]  governments do this, and the public's been told, none of it exists when it's all right
[1:26:50.920 --> 1:26:51.920]  in our face.
[1:26:51.920 --> 1:26:59.840]  Yeah, it's really quite something, and you know, my father was, went to school in the
[1:26:59.840 --> 1:27:05.320]  US, and we lived, he went to Marquette and Notre Dame, and has always been an adamant,
[1:27:05.320 --> 1:27:11.080]  you know, Kennedy was assassinated, and basically his theory was that when Kennedy came out
[1:27:11.080 --> 1:27:17.160]  with the Peace Corps, and was sort of downplaying the use of the military as a global way to
[1:27:17.160 --> 1:27:21.960]  spread American influence, and the Peace Corps was the way to do it, that that didn't serve
[1:27:21.960 --> 1:27:24.520]  the needs of anybody, they just shot him.
[1:27:24.520 --> 1:27:29.880]  You know, anyway, that's one of the reasons why I called, just to thank you, I really,
[1:27:29.880 --> 1:27:34.520]  I find it, you know, I hope you're making a good buck on this, you deserve it, but wow,
[1:27:34.520 --> 1:27:40.240]  you are really passionate in its inspiring, and you know, the films are just, really,
[1:27:40.240 --> 1:27:44.080]  I've just, as I show them to other people, I'm amazed at the reactions.
[1:27:44.080 --> 1:27:48.520]  All right, well I appreciate your call, to answer the question of making a buck off of
[1:27:48.520 --> 1:27:52.960]  this, the mainstream media, they can be made, you know, pay 10, 12 million dollars to sit
[1:27:52.960 --> 1:27:57.840]  there and read off a teleprompter, and that's okay, but then this radio show makes a fraction
[1:27:57.840 --> 1:28:03.560]  of that, and puts it, almost all of it, back into expanding the websites, the cost, the
[1:28:03.560 --> 1:28:07.920]  employees, and that's supposedly not a good thing with some people.
[1:28:07.920 --> 1:28:13.880]  My goal here is not to make money, in fact, if you must know, most of my films lose money.
[1:28:13.880 --> 1:28:18.120]  Most of the films I've made, in-game made some money, Terror Store made a little bit
[1:28:18.120 --> 1:28:19.120]  of money.
[1:28:19.120 --> 1:28:23.400]  You really must know, the last few films have lost money, and I mean, big time.
[1:28:23.400 --> 1:28:31.040]  Loose change, Final Cut, Truth Rising, I mean, maybe in a year or two, it might make the
[1:28:31.040 --> 1:28:32.120]  money back.
[1:28:32.120 --> 1:28:36.440]  That's not the goal of those, and you ask, how do we operate?
[1:28:36.440 --> 1:28:44.040]  Previously I only had three employees, one of them doing web stuff, and my wife did the
[1:28:44.040 --> 1:28:48.360]  Info Wars, Paul Watson did Prison Planet, his brother basically worked for free, if you
[1:28:48.360 --> 1:28:55.120]  must know how we operate, and then I realized we needed to expand, so I started taking advertising.
[1:28:55.120 --> 1:28:58.720]  Previously we sent an email, and people wanted to advertise, they could, and it was almost
[1:28:58.720 --> 1:28:59.720]  nothing.
[1:28:59.720 --> 1:29:08.120]  So, in the last two years, we ramped up advertising, and then I hired like 10 more people, and
[1:29:08.120 --> 1:29:15.120]  so the money comes in, and it pays the 14 employees of InfoWars.com.
[1:29:15.120 --> 1:29:18.360]  We didn't have money to get a bigger office, or build a studio, which we're getting close
[1:29:18.360 --> 1:29:22.680]  to being done with, or do any of that, so we did a money bomb, somebody else's idea,
[1:29:22.680 --> 1:29:25.720]  that's how we were able to move and do that.
[1:29:25.720 --> 1:29:30.560]  And so, but we are a huge success when it comes to my films being seen by hundreds of
[1:29:30.560 --> 1:29:37.960]  millions total on the web, and so we are a success in the InfoWars, but the films monetarily
[1:29:37.960 --> 1:29:43.120]  by and large are failures, I mean, one editing computer is like five grand, the cameras are
[1:29:43.120 --> 1:29:48.160]  like six, seven grand, paying for an editor, even at low grade, you know, a amount of money
[1:29:48.160 --> 1:29:50.520]  is incredibly expensive.
[1:29:50.520 --> 1:29:59.880]  We're on the march, the empires on the run, Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[1:29:59.880 --> 1:30:05.600]  Did you know that it's a documented fact, 80% of all Americans and 85% of people around
[1:30:05.600 --> 1:30:09.160]  the world suffer from internal parasites and parasitic infection?
[1:30:09.160 --> 1:30:13.520]  You may be one of millions of people suffering from one of dozens of debilitating chronic
[1:30:13.520 --> 1:30:17.240]  diseases from these parasites and your doctor would never know it.
[1:30:17.240 --> 1:30:21.760]  In fact, clinically detected parasites account for only 1% of all cases.
[1:30:21.760 --> 1:30:26.680]  Don't continue to suffer from pain due to misdiagnosis, now you can fight internal parasites, heavy
[1:30:26.680 --> 1:30:32.200]  metal poisoning and high cholesterol, naturally and safely, by mixing fossilized phytoplankton
[1:30:32.200 --> 1:30:36.120]  powder, also known as FPP, with your favorite beverage once a day.

[1:30:42.680 --> 1:30:47.280]  FPP strengthens skin, hair and bones, lowers cholesterol and is an excellent source of
[1:30:47.280 --> 1:30:50.600]  natural plant-based silica with 14 trace minerals.

[1:30:57.200 --> 1:31:05.280]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war
[1:31:05.280 --> 1:31:06.760]  against this country.
[1:31:06.760 --> 1:31:10.520]  The enemies struck America on September 11th, but who is the enemy?
[1:31:10.520 --> 1:31:11.520]  Ben Laden.
[1:31:11.520 --> 1:31:12.520]  This is his MO.
[1:31:12.520 --> 1:31:16.120]  We have to look to the Middle East, we have to look to the Psalm of Ben Laden.
[1:31:16.120 --> 1:31:20.760]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence
[1:31:20.760 --> 1:31:23.360]  networks inside the United States.
[1:31:23.360 --> 1:31:27.800]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying
[1:31:27.800 --> 1:31:29.960]  in and on the U.S.
[1:31:29.960 --> 1:31:33.560]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[1:31:33.560 --> 1:31:39.120]  Ben Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection,
[1:31:39.120 --> 1:31:43.280]  the Israeli intelligence network, warnings in war games, the shadow government and much,
[1:31:43.280 --> 1:31:44.280]  much more.

[1:32:11.880 --> 1:32:19.560]  and fear or confidence because you knew what was coming and got prepared with patriotfood.com.

[1:32:28.560 --> 1:32:34.320]  What good is it to know the truth about any conspiracy unless you take action?

[1:32:57.720 --> 1:33:17.800]  All right, I want to go back to John, Rebecca, Mike and others, but I'm going to do a video
[1:33:17.800 --> 1:33:22.160]  in our new office in the next few months when I get time to walk through, show everybody
[1:33:22.160 --> 1:33:23.160]  kind of a turb.
[1:33:23.160 --> 1:33:24.660]  What will you do?
[1:33:24.660 --> 1:33:31.680]  I thought we need to create a bio on the website about who works here, who the people are.
[1:33:31.680 --> 1:33:37.560]  Thank God that Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com have gotten so big because we are able to
[1:33:37.560 --> 1:33:42.680]  then pay $10,000 a month for shortwave.
[1:33:42.680 --> 1:33:47.120]  Most stations put us on for free, but a few stations that have offered to be leased to
[1:33:47.120 --> 1:33:48.880]  carry the show inexpensively.
[1:33:48.880 --> 1:33:49.880]  We lease five stations.
[1:33:49.880 --> 1:33:54.640]  I don't know how long I can do that.
[1:33:54.640 --> 1:33:58.360]  I pay now about $20,000 a month in IT.
[1:33:58.360 --> 1:34:02.960]  Yes, ladies and gentlemen, that's how much these servers cost and believe me, we got
[1:34:02.960 --> 1:34:03.960]  good deals.
[1:34:03.960 --> 1:34:12.560]  Two CDNs, seven other servers, then two IT people who are just part-time, who don't
[1:34:12.560 --> 1:34:21.680]  even count as employees, and then rent, taxes, and I'm not going to open myself up to the
[1:34:21.680 --> 1:34:22.680]  enemy.
[1:34:22.680 --> 1:34:23.680]  People say, oh, be bold.
[1:34:23.680 --> 1:34:24.680]  Don't pay taxes.
[1:34:24.680 --> 1:34:27.560]  Well, about half the time, doing that, you end up going to prison, and so we've chosen
[1:34:27.560 --> 1:34:32.480]  our battle so we can be here attacking them, talking about how they're illegitimate, exposing
[1:34:32.480 --> 1:34:37.440]  them, and then openly saying, but I still pay the, but we spend almost all the money
[1:34:37.440 --> 1:34:41.000]  on the business, so it doesn't matter, they don't get paid very much.
[1:34:41.000 --> 1:34:42.880]  That's the beauty of it.
[1:34:42.880 --> 1:34:48.800]  Through the employees, though, they're getting a lot of taxes, and that's what the media
[1:34:48.800 --> 1:34:53.520]  and the government always do to attack alternative media.
[1:34:53.520 --> 1:34:58.600]  As they say, those people, they're out there preaching stuff against the government to
[1:34:58.600 --> 1:34:59.600]  make money.
[1:34:59.600 --> 1:35:03.240]  Well, that's what we need, like G. Ebert Griffin says, actually, we need power.
[1:35:03.240 --> 1:35:04.240]  We need money.
[1:35:04.240 --> 1:35:06.800]  We need to have our own fox news or CNN.
[1:35:06.800 --> 1:35:09.080]  We need to have a lot more money.
[1:35:09.080 --> 1:35:13.120]  We bet we need our books to be number one bestsellers.
[1:35:13.120 --> 1:35:21.200]  I've had in games been the number one documentary on Amazon, number eight video total, but that's
[1:35:21.200 --> 1:35:23.840]  selling like 3,000 in a week will do that.
[1:35:23.840 --> 1:35:27.240]  It's not as big as it sounds, and I get about a dollar for each one of those that are sold
[1:35:27.240 --> 1:35:28.240]  on there.
[1:35:28.240 --> 1:35:31.760]  That's the incredible margin they demand from you.
[1:35:31.760 --> 1:35:36.880]  So I try to not obsess on money here on the show, but I get the point of plugging sponsors
[1:35:36.880 --> 1:35:43.760]  so much that make it all possible because the videos aren't successful at funding us,
[1:35:43.760 --> 1:35:47.000]  and then I forget to even ever plug the videos and promote them, and that's not good because
[1:35:47.000 --> 1:35:53.480]  they are the most successful thing we do, but you getting copies of them, making copies
[1:35:53.480 --> 1:35:59.520]  of them, passing the files around on the web, I mean, I put up links to truth rising and
[1:35:59.520 --> 1:36:04.240]  in game and terror storm from Google and YouTube on my own site.
[1:36:04.240 --> 1:36:05.920]  I don't just allow them to be out there.
[1:36:05.920 --> 1:36:13.840]  I advertise don't pay because my thrill is having my videos be seen by tens of millions
[1:36:13.840 --> 1:36:16.400]  of people a month.
[1:36:16.400 --> 1:36:19.920]  That's what I'm after is defeating the new world order because I know I don't have any
[1:36:19.920 --> 1:36:26.440]  future if we don't turn this around.
[1:36:26.440 --> 1:36:28.160]  That is my goal.
[1:36:28.160 --> 1:36:33.880]  If I had my druthers, I would go out in the countryside and buy a nice old house super
[1:36:33.880 --> 1:36:42.480]  cheap, and I would be an oil painter, pen and ink painter.
[1:36:42.480 --> 1:36:47.440]  At night, I would probably do something like own a gas station, have a few old guys that
[1:36:47.440 --> 1:36:51.000]  fart around there working for me.
[1:36:51.000 --> 1:36:57.040]  I'd have a few cows, maybe 40, 50 acres, and I'd have a big garden because I'm not ambitious.
[1:36:57.040 --> 1:37:03.840]  I am somebody who's self-satisfied, self-actualized, and I believe me would like to live like
[1:37:03.840 --> 1:37:08.160]  a hillbilly, but then I'd have to support myself so I'd live somewhere and have a small
[1:37:08.160 --> 1:37:13.360]  business because I know you can't, unless you go all out farming and ranching and then
[1:37:13.360 --> 1:37:16.920]  you've got a lot of money to start that, that you can't make it and it's too dangerous.
[1:37:16.920 --> 1:37:21.480]  You've got to supplement a country gentleman lifestyle.
[1:37:21.480 --> 1:37:26.440]  That's what I'd be doing right now, but I don't have a future.
[1:37:26.440 --> 1:37:29.240]  I can't go live out in the countryside and wait for the new world order to roll through
[1:37:29.240 --> 1:37:43.440]  and take the farm, take the ranch.
[1:37:43.440 --> 1:37:48.600]  On his end, but basically my whole show now is pops and springs and breakups.
[1:37:48.600 --> 1:37:51.360]  John, you got me on there right now?
[1:37:51.360 --> 1:37:52.360]  Okay.
[1:37:52.360 --> 1:37:53.360]  Yeah.
[1:37:53.360 --> 1:37:54.360]  Yeah.
[1:37:54.360 --> 1:37:55.360]  Okay.
[1:37:55.360 --> 1:37:56.360]  Reconnect.
[1:37:56.360 --> 1:37:57.360]  Do the other one.
[1:37:57.360 --> 1:38:00.320]  Okay. And if they're trying to use it for something else, get me another one.
[1:38:00.320 --> 1:38:01.320]  That's why I put two in it.
[1:38:01.320 --> 1:38:06.520]  If you get around this and they're always using the other one for something, I need it.
[1:38:06.520 --> 1:38:09.280]  But again, it isn't about Alex Jones, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:38:09.280 --> 1:38:12.880]  I don't have a government that can come take your money.
[1:38:12.880 --> 1:38:16.120]  I don't have a government that can devalue your currency.
[1:38:16.120 --> 1:38:29.160]  I'm not the government threatening to go and take your pension funds.
[1:38:29.160 --> 1:38:30.320]  I am not the government.
[1:38:30.320 --> 1:38:32.120]  So it's not about me.
[1:38:32.120 --> 1:38:33.880]  It's not about Alex Jones.
[1:38:33.880 --> 1:38:38.120]  It's about the information.
[1:38:38.120 --> 1:38:44.120]  And I suggest people stay focused on the issues that really matter.
[1:38:44.120 --> 1:38:46.360]  I mean, the government knows how to manipulate people.
[1:38:46.360 --> 1:38:47.800]  They did that to the Black Panthers.
[1:38:47.800 --> 1:38:49.720]  They did it to activists.
[1:38:49.720 --> 1:38:53.600]  The British did it to the founding fathers, you know, saying they were just profiteers
[1:38:53.600 --> 1:38:54.600]  for the rebellion.
[1:38:54.600 --> 1:38:56.040]  And some of that might have even been true.
[1:38:56.040 --> 1:38:58.880]  The point is, is that the New World Order is a threat.
[1:38:58.880 --> 1:39:00.520]  It's the New World Order that's coming down on us.
[1:39:00.520 --> 1:39:02.720]  And as a society, we're mentally ill.
[1:39:02.720 --> 1:39:05.440]  We're obsessed with infighting and going after each other.
[1:39:05.440 --> 1:39:09.680]  Because I am the big Kingfish in the whole anti-New World Order movement.
[1:39:09.680 --> 1:39:11.320]  Very dangerous position, by the way.
[1:39:11.320 --> 1:39:16.320]  A woman I never saw it, but by hard work have achieved.
[1:39:16.320 --> 1:39:26.760]  You know, in the final equation, a lot of people want to claim fights with me.
[1:39:26.760 --> 1:39:29.000]  They want to claim arguments with me.
[1:39:29.000 --> 1:39:33.200]  They want to claim I'm involved with things with them to try to raise their credibility.
[1:39:33.200 --> 1:39:34.200]  There's a lot of lies.
[1:39:34.200 --> 1:39:35.200]  And most of it isn't.
[1:39:35.200 --> 1:39:36.680]  John, the ISDM's still not good.
[1:39:36.680 --> 1:39:41.400]  Like I said, can we connect with the other one?
[1:39:41.400 --> 1:39:44.200]  Can't get a connection on that one.
[1:39:44.200 --> 1:39:46.560]  And we've gone through a lot of hell to bring you to this radio show.
[1:39:46.560 --> 1:39:52.440]  A lot of things that have happened behind the scenes that I haven't even talked about.
[1:39:52.440 --> 1:40:00.600]  But yes, we need more donations.
[1:40:00.600 --> 1:40:02.520]  We need more support.
[1:40:02.520 --> 1:40:05.200]  We need people to buy the books and videos.
[1:40:05.200 --> 1:40:11.560]  Not just because it supports this operation and what we do, but also because these videos
[1:40:11.560 --> 1:40:12.560]  are powerful.
[1:40:12.560 --> 1:40:13.560]  They are truth.
[1:40:13.560 --> 1:40:17.920]  I mean, Terror Storm is the best government-sponsored terror film out there, not just about 9-11,
[1:40:17.920 --> 1:40:18.920]  but about the history of it.
[1:40:18.920 --> 1:40:21.960]  I mean, it wakes people up with all the admissions.
[1:40:21.960 --> 1:40:26.200]  Once you can show somebody that the government is criminal and has staged terror over and
[1:40:26.200 --> 1:40:31.160]  over and over again, or in-game, where we show how the government has tested chemicals,
[1:40:31.160 --> 1:40:39.920]  radiologicals, radiologicals on citizens over and over and over again.
[1:40:39.920 --> 1:40:42.360]  Once you do that, it's over.
[1:40:42.360 --> 1:40:45.720]  You win their mind over.
[1:40:45.720 --> 1:40:47.080]  They unlock their brains.
[1:40:47.080 --> 1:40:49.240]  They now see the truth.
[1:40:49.240 --> 1:40:52.360]  And then the next part of the film, we'll get into how 9-11 is an inside job, but the
[1:40:52.360 --> 1:40:56.560]  first two-thirds are about other government-sponsored terror events.
[1:40:56.560 --> 1:41:00.760]  And that film is so good, so important, so well done.
[1:41:00.760 --> 1:41:07.640]  Myself and Rob Jacobson and Aaron Dykes busted our butts to make that film.
[1:41:07.640 --> 1:41:12.920]  Three guys, and Mike McWhorter was the graphics guy, did a great job.
[1:41:12.920 --> 1:41:18.120]  I mean, that is a powerful film that unlocks minds.
[1:41:18.120 --> 1:41:21.880]  And what a lot of critics do instead of use the film, what people up there say, there's
[1:41:21.880 --> 1:41:25.880]  pyramids and all-seeing eyes in it, it's subliminal.
[1:41:25.880 --> 1:41:31.280]  Man, he should have done this in his film.
[1:41:31.280 --> 1:41:34.440]  There's nothing subliminal about having an all-seeing eye on the screen for 20 seconds
[1:41:34.440 --> 1:41:35.840]  saying the New World Order.
[1:41:35.840 --> 1:41:37.040]  We're showing you their symbol.
[1:41:37.040 --> 1:41:47.000]  If I made a film about the Nazis and I showed you a swastika, if I showed you a swastika
[1:41:47.000 --> 1:41:51.880]  taking over Europe, that wouldn't mean I was a Nazi.
[1:41:51.880 --> 1:41:55.760]  And then people lie and say that we're covering up for Israel with the USS Liberty.
[1:41:55.760 --> 1:41:57.120]  What type of disinfo is that?
[1:41:57.120 --> 1:42:02.520]  We show that Israel premeditatedly attacked the ship to blame it on Egypt and launch World
[1:42:02.520 --> 1:42:07.920]  War III right out of Operation Northwood, just a few years after Gulf of Tonkin.
[1:42:07.920 --> 1:42:12.040]  But we show what the admirals and the judge-advocate generals and the people on the ship say that
[1:42:12.040 --> 1:42:17.440]  they believe and know that LBJ was in control of the ship under the National Security Council
[1:42:17.440 --> 1:42:23.160]  as a spy ship and was directing it directly under, through McNamara, and he came on the
[1:42:23.160 --> 1:42:26.040]  line and said, I want that GD ship going to the bottom.
[1:42:26.040 --> 1:42:30.240]  And so we connected it and showed how our government was criminal and involved with
[1:42:30.240 --> 1:42:32.000]  the Israelis.
[1:42:32.000 --> 1:42:33.720]  That isn't covering up for Israel.
[1:42:33.720 --> 1:42:38.640]  See, that's the type of unfair attacks we get that if anybody had a brain, they would
[1:42:38.640 --> 1:42:45.720]  know a film challenging and showing that Israel staged terror attacks is not a film covering
[1:42:45.720 --> 1:42:47.400]  up for Israel.
[1:42:47.400 --> 1:42:53.360]  And the people putting that out are, and we've caught the Southern Poverty Law Center and
[1:42:53.360 --> 1:42:59.280]  others over and over again, I mean, take that guy, Hal Turner, I mean, if that guy just
[1:42:59.280 --> 1:43:02.160]  radiates two seconds, you know, he's one of them.
[1:43:02.160 --> 1:43:08.320]  How could people not see it and not know it, and they want to make criticism of Israel
[1:43:08.320 --> 1:43:16.320]  base gutter, racist, vicious, to sound horrible, to scare people away from standing up against
[1:43:16.320 --> 1:43:18.240]  the corruption of Israel.
[1:43:18.240 --> 1:43:26.880]  They want to make it about the hatred of Jews.
[1:43:26.880 --> 1:43:32.800]  Instead of making it about the hatred of corruption, if we're against the Italian mafia or not
[1:43:32.800 --> 1:43:42.840]  against Italians, if we're against the Jewish mafia or not against Jews, if we are against
[1:43:42.840 --> 1:43:48.000]  any of these corrupt elites, it's because those governments are corrupt and bad, not
[1:43:48.000 --> 1:43:49.000]  because the people are bad.
[1:43:49.000 --> 1:43:52.560]  England is one of the most evil empires in the world, some of the most evil ideas and
[1:43:52.560 --> 1:43:53.680]  systems came from there.
[1:43:53.680 --> 1:43:59.880]  The Bretzers slaves to it too.
[1:43:59.880 --> 1:44:04.240]  And so I don't mean to go off on a jack because that guy brings up, I'm sure I bet you're
[1:44:04.240 --> 1:44:05.240]  doing really well.
[1:44:05.240 --> 1:44:08.080]  I hope you're doing really well.
[1:44:08.080 --> 1:44:12.240]  And in the final equation, I think it is important as hard as I work and the work I do that
[1:44:12.240 --> 1:44:19.800]  I drive safe cars and double about a new pair of shoes every year and live in a house that's
[1:44:19.800 --> 1:44:20.800]  comfortable.
[1:44:20.800 --> 1:44:21.960]  But that isn't what I worship.
[1:44:21.960 --> 1:44:23.680]  That isn't what I'm about.
[1:44:23.680 --> 1:44:27.440]  That isn't what I'm into, bobbles and trinkets and signets.
[1:44:27.440 --> 1:44:32.560]  And we need as a movement to get past the point of thinking it's bad for us to not just
[1:44:32.560 --> 1:44:37.280]  be able to pay our way with information, but we have to build up our movement and that
[1:44:37.280 --> 1:44:42.360]  takes capital and we're ready to get big Hollywood stars to come to our side.
[1:44:42.360 --> 1:44:46.160]  We have to get ready to get big politicians to come and join us and industry people and
[1:44:46.160 --> 1:44:54.560]  people in powerful positions, philosophers and authors and playwrights.
[1:44:54.560 --> 1:44:55.820]  We are winning.
[1:44:55.820 --> 1:44:58.240]  We are waking people up.
[1:44:58.240 --> 1:45:03.600]  We're doing something historical as so much of the world wakes up.
[1:45:03.600 --> 1:45:10.440]  And as 9-Eleven Truth has been so successful, lift the blinders on hundreds of fronts.
[1:45:10.440 --> 1:45:18.560]  That is a beautiful, beautiful, beautiful thing.
[1:45:18.560 --> 1:45:25.120]  And we should be so very proud of that.
[1:45:25.120 --> 1:45:31.760]  So I want you to support our sponsors and the main sponsor is my books and videos that
[1:45:31.760 --> 1:45:32.760]  are waking people up.
[1:45:32.760 --> 1:45:35.640]  You can find them at infowars.com, order the books, order the videos.
[1:45:35.640 --> 1:45:38.600]  I want you to get them and make copies and give them to people.
[1:45:38.600 --> 1:45:42.000]  I have to say not-for-profit, non-sale because people will then take it, claim the copyright
[1:45:42.000 --> 1:45:43.600]  for themselves and tell me I can't sell it.
[1:45:43.600 --> 1:45:45.000]  We've already had people try that.
[1:45:45.000 --> 1:45:47.960]  God, no good deed goes unpunished.
[1:45:47.960 --> 1:45:51.560]  Get them out to folks, educate people, no take action.
[1:45:51.560 --> 1:45:52.560]  It's having an effect.
[1:45:52.560 --> 1:45:54.880]  People are ready to wake up whenever before.
[1:45:54.880 --> 1:45:58.800]  And yes, support the sponsors that we have on this radio show as well.
[1:45:58.800 --> 1:46:04.160]  Many of sponsors, who are the sponsors, I say firearms, I wish we had firearms sponsors,
[1:46:04.160 --> 1:46:05.160]  we don't.
[1:46:05.160 --> 1:46:07.600]  I say, storeable food, we get you a good company for that.
[1:46:07.600 --> 1:46:10.040]  Now look into the mainstream, says it.
[1:46:10.040 --> 1:46:16.960]  I tell you my goal, it's 260 bucks an ounce, it's 400 bucks, 500, 800, they're artificially
[1:46:16.960 --> 1:46:22.840]  suppressing the paper market while all the major mints in Europe and the U.S. and Canada,
[1:46:22.840 --> 1:46:25.160]  no more maple leafs, no more.
[1:46:25.160 --> 1:46:29.240]  Now it's eagles, not just the buffaloes.
[1:46:29.240 --> 1:46:32.720]  Now it's the British sovereigns.
[1:46:32.720 --> 1:46:34.400]  They're running out of gold.
[1:46:34.400 --> 1:46:39.960]  And so you bet I bring you a sponsor, which makes this network and this show possible.
[1:46:39.960 --> 1:46:43.560]  And I tell you, you're crazy if you don't buy gold and silver.
[1:46:43.560 --> 1:46:45.320]  It's also a great deal.
[1:46:45.320 --> 1:46:48.280]  And why can Ted get gold and nobody else can right now?
[1:46:48.280 --> 1:46:51.720]  Because he's been in this business 30 years and knows all the international sellers who
[1:46:51.720 --> 1:46:55.080]  won't sell to people they don't trust, which is most people in this business.
[1:46:55.080 --> 1:47:00.000]  But they trust Ted, so Ted has a whole parcel of coins that you can't get anywhere else
[1:47:00.000 --> 1:47:01.000]  right now.
[1:47:01.000 --> 1:47:02.000]  Ted Anderson, are you there?
[1:47:02.000 --> 1:47:03.000]  Yeah.
[1:47:03.000 --> 1:47:04.000]  I'm right here with you, Alex.
[1:47:04.000 --> 1:47:05.000]  How are you doing?
[1:47:05.000 --> 1:47:06.000]  Good.
[1:47:06.000 --> 1:47:07.000]  I tell people about the offer you've got today.
[1:47:07.000 --> 1:47:08.000]  Oh yeah.
[1:47:08.000 --> 1:47:11.680]  We're talking with, took me a little bit to look for U.S. eagles and find a good supply
[1:47:11.680 --> 1:47:12.680]  of those to sell.
[1:47:12.680 --> 1:47:13.680]  I can tell you that much.
[1:47:13.680 --> 1:47:18.880]  We do have them there at 1,033 and surprise, surprise, the premiums on them are just going
[1:47:18.880 --> 1:47:20.120]  up like crazy.
[1:47:20.120 --> 1:47:26.680]  I was running into one guy wanting to have actually $70 over spot for Krugerons and those
[1:47:26.680 --> 1:47:30.480]  things are trading for almost spot here a few months ago.
[1:47:30.480 --> 1:47:31.480]  Yeah.
[1:47:31.480 --> 1:47:32.480]  Let's be clear, Ted.
[1:47:32.480 --> 1:47:33.480]  I talked to you this morning.
[1:47:33.480 --> 1:47:36.800]  There's a 3% markup in that coin to literally just pay your brokers.
[1:47:36.800 --> 1:47:40.120]  So you are giving it to people at your cost, those eagles.
[1:47:40.120 --> 1:47:43.120]  You're doing that to, again, get their business, get them into gold.
[1:47:43.120 --> 1:47:44.360]  Most people have no the truth.
[1:47:44.360 --> 1:47:45.800]  They've still never invested in it.
[1:47:45.800 --> 1:47:48.440]  That's why on this show, you give your lost leaders.
[1:47:48.440 --> 1:47:52.760]  Yeah, that's right, and I just really think it's important for people to get into gold
[1:47:52.760 --> 1:47:53.760]  at this time.
[1:47:53.760 --> 1:47:57.880]  And I really truly believe that some of the best buys in gold right now at this point
[1:47:57.880 --> 1:48:03.720]  are the Frank coin, which is at 194 and the sovereign coin, which is at 239.
[1:48:03.720 --> 1:48:06.160]  And don't forget about Silver Alex, my gosh.
[1:48:06.160 --> 1:48:09.800]  You know those walking liberties that we're putting out there and what I think they were
[1:48:09.800 --> 1:48:16.040]  around seven something last time, I priced them, now they're out closer to 10.
[1:48:16.040 --> 1:48:19.640]  And I've got some of the Franklin have still available at 870.
[1:48:19.640 --> 1:48:23.000]  And you know the thing about it is, I mean yesterday the phones are ringing like crazy.
[1:48:23.000 --> 1:48:24.880]  People wanting to, you know, they need to get the gold.
[1:48:24.880 --> 1:48:29.440]  They understand the situation that's going on in the United States.
[1:48:29.440 --> 1:48:34.200]  And you know, having somebody from Britain, they're talking about trying to just buy them
[1:48:34.200 --> 1:48:37.080]  and they can't even get to the darn gold store to buy them.
[1:48:37.080 --> 1:48:39.120]  And when they do get there, there's nothing to buy.
[1:48:39.120 --> 1:48:41.320]  That's what's going on here in the United States too.
[1:48:41.320 --> 1:48:43.560]  There just isn't enough volume to go around.
[1:48:43.560 --> 1:48:48.040]  There's so much trouble economically going on in the United States at this time that
[1:48:48.040 --> 1:48:52.720]  even the people that normally would be just buying stocks and in the bond market, that
[1:48:52.720 --> 1:48:55.640]  kind of thing are now looking at gold as an alternative.
[1:48:55.640 --> 1:48:58.600]  And there's just not enough physical supply to get to those people.
[1:48:58.600 --> 1:49:04.160]  And thank God your audience has had the opportunity at this point to get in before that frenzy
[1:49:04.160 --> 1:49:07.320]  came along.
[1:49:07.320 --> 1:49:13.520]  But anyway, again, explain to people, explain to people that almost all the other brokers
[1:49:13.520 --> 1:49:21.520]  out there can't get them or are charging people 50 to, you know, 50, 100, $200 markups or
[1:49:21.520 --> 1:49:26.080]  an ounce of gold because they're having to pay massive premiums just to get something.
[1:49:26.080 --> 1:49:27.880]  A lot of places are completely sold out.
[1:49:27.880 --> 1:49:32.040]  You can Google that as mainstream news and it's only going to intensify.
[1:49:32.040 --> 1:49:37.200]  You're offering gold at $100 under what it was selling for.
[1:49:37.200 --> 1:49:40.160]  So it drops 20 today from 100 and something that's getting, doesn't matter because you
[1:49:40.160 --> 1:49:45.840]  still locked this in back when it was, I can tell you, I have got the best price on British
[1:49:45.840 --> 1:49:48.840]  sovereigns and French Franks in the market today.
[1:49:48.840 --> 1:49:51.960]  There's nobody else out there that has a price that's better than mine.
[1:49:51.960 --> 1:49:56.200]  And that's because of this position that I put myself into last Monday.
[1:49:56.200 --> 1:50:00.440]  Actually it was last Friday, the Friday coming in right before the weekend.
[1:50:00.440 --> 1:50:04.240]  There is nobody out there that has that stuff at that particular price level.
[1:50:04.240 --> 1:50:09.040]  And this situation with the US Eagles, try getting them.
[1:50:09.040 --> 1:50:11.080]  I mean, the buffaloes are gone.
[1:50:11.080 --> 1:50:14.240]  We keep on talking about wanting to get some buffaloes and I keep talking to every one
[1:50:14.240 --> 1:50:15.240]  of my dealers.
[1:50:15.240 --> 1:50:16.880]  Any buffaloes you find, buy them for me.
[1:50:16.880 --> 1:50:19.000]  I want them in my inventory so I can sell them.
[1:50:19.000 --> 1:50:21.000]  I'd offer them right now if I could get them.
[1:50:21.000 --> 1:50:25.400]  There's just not anything out there and the same thing holds true for the US Eagles.
[1:50:25.400 --> 1:50:29.440]  Believe it or not, Canadian Maple is something that I used to be able to sell in great quantity
[1:50:29.440 --> 1:50:30.520]  anytime you wanted.
[1:50:30.520 --> 1:50:34.800]  The Royal Mint won't even sell them anymore because they can't, they're out of them.
[1:50:34.800 --> 1:50:40.800]  And the British Mint, the German Mint, the Canadian Mint, the US Mint are saying, we're
[1:50:40.800 --> 1:50:41.800]  shutting down.
[1:50:41.800 --> 1:50:48.840]  We can't get gold to stamp it and we can't buy it and stamp it and then sell it for what
[1:50:48.840 --> 1:50:52.360]  the market says it's supposed to cost because that number isn't real.
[1:50:52.360 --> 1:50:54.160]  It's a controlled market.
[1:50:54.160 --> 1:50:58.480]  The gold is gone off the shelves and they're still holding the price basically the same.
[1:50:58.480 --> 1:51:00.160]  Stay there Ted.
[1:51:00.160 --> 1:51:05.440]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to Grounds here
[1:51:05.440 --> 1:51:09.320]  and we knew what to do or at least we thought we did.
[1:51:09.320 --> 1:51:14.560]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform
[1:51:14.560 --> 1:51:16.040]  to tell their story.
[1:51:16.040 --> 1:51:25.160]  Whitman, EVA director on the 18 made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[1:51:25.160 --> 1:51:29.920]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 Truth as brave souls throughout the world
[1:51:29.920 --> 1:51:32.240]  take action against their global masters.
[1:51:32.240 --> 1:51:35.360]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting the countdown.
[1:51:35.360 --> 1:51:41.200]  He takes his hand off and you hear it 3, 2, 1 and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[1:51:41.200 --> 1:51:44.720]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[1:51:44.720 --> 1:51:50.560]  Download Truth Rising at prisonplanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide or order
[1:51:50.560 --> 1:51:53.200]  the DVD at infowars.com.
[1:51:53.200 --> 1:51:56.880]  If we don't expose the government sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts
[1:51:56.880 --> 1:52:00.960]  and bring in martial law.
[1:52:00.960 --> 1:52:03.520]  They say you can't predict the stock market.
[1:52:03.520 --> 1:52:07.040]  If you trade on a regular basis, you've probably heard that lie.
[1:52:07.040 --> 1:52:11.200]  But what if I told you there's a way to know which way the market will go each week a whole
[1:52:11.200 --> 1:52:12.600]  week in advance?
[1:52:12.600 --> 1:52:15.360]  Do you think you could benefit from this kind of information?
[1:52:15.360 --> 1:52:19.960]  The guys over at eminiforecaster.com put out a weekly forecast line.
[1:52:19.960 --> 1:52:24.200]  They call it a G line, which forecast the direction of the stock market a whole week
[1:52:24.200 --> 1:52:25.200]  in advance.
[1:52:25.200 --> 1:52:26.300]  Impossible?

[1:54:18.240 --> 1:54:22.200]  Ladies and gentlemen, the New World Order is coming down on us.
[1:54:22.200 --> 1:54:23.920]  They're going to devalue the dollar down to nothing.
[1:54:23.920 --> 1:54:27.920]  That is a guaranteed interest rates rolling to do that further.
[1:54:27.920 --> 1:54:31.000]  They're talking about cutting them again.
[1:54:31.000 --> 1:54:35.080]  Bev Harris is coming up in the next hour to break down all the election fraud.
[1:54:35.080 --> 1:54:38.600]  She sniffed out during the primaries and put their look in that going into the election
[1:54:38.600 --> 1:54:40.600]  in about 27 days.
[1:54:40.600 --> 1:54:45.680]  Ted, finishing up, you've got gold when nobody else seems to have it.
[1:54:45.680 --> 1:54:48.440]  I mean, I'd say, what, 90% of the dealers you were telling me the other day are out
[1:54:48.440 --> 1:54:49.440]  of it?
[1:54:49.440 --> 1:54:51.440]  What is it currently today talking to the dealers?
[1:54:51.440 --> 1:54:54.520]  How many are out of gold or selling at a giant premium?
[1:54:54.520 --> 1:54:57.840]  Well, I can tell you right now, I was just talking to one of the dealers this morning
[1:54:57.840 --> 1:54:59.200]  and it's like, hey, can I get this?
[1:54:59.200 --> 1:55:00.360]  No, I can't get that.
[1:55:00.360 --> 1:55:01.360]  Can you get this?
[1:55:01.360 --> 1:55:02.360]  No, I can't get that.
[1:55:02.360 --> 1:55:03.360]  I said, well, how about this and that?
[1:55:03.360 --> 1:55:06.040]  I'm just like going through all these different products.
[1:55:06.040 --> 1:55:09.120]  Right now, the walking Liberty haves are still currently sold out.
[1:55:09.120 --> 1:55:13.800]  I still have those Franklin haves that probably can do about another nine bags of them and
[1:55:13.800 --> 1:55:15.760]  then I'm going to have to pull those off the shelf.
[1:55:15.760 --> 1:55:19.480]  I'm going to go back to dimes then because they made those available to me.
[1:55:19.480 --> 1:55:23.000]  It's just like there's just this selection of different things that I could deal with,
[1:55:23.000 --> 1:55:28.680]  but the market is just so tight and most of the smaller dealers just don't have a thing.
[1:55:28.680 --> 1:55:32.960]  If you walk into the local coin shops and you say, hey, do you have any $20 St. Goddons
[1:55:32.960 --> 1:55:37.160]  in any of the US seagulls, do you have any Maple Leafs, do you have any Krugerans?
[1:55:37.160 --> 1:55:38.400]  They don't have a thing.
[1:55:38.400 --> 1:55:39.800]  There's just nothing there.
[1:55:39.800 --> 1:55:40.800]  And the major dealers-
[1:55:40.800 --> 1:55:46.840]  So we're looking at something where you could potentially be out of almost everything yourself.
[1:55:46.840 --> 1:55:48.080]  How soon have this continues to?
[1:55:48.080 --> 1:55:51.760]  Well, if it continues to go this direction, I wouldn't doubt it if it was just within
[1:55:51.760 --> 1:55:56.440]  a month or two that I won't be able to even trade gold for the paper currency that you're
[1:55:56.440 --> 1:55:58.360]  trying to buy it with.
[1:55:58.360 --> 1:55:59.360]  That's what's going on right now.
[1:55:59.360 --> 1:56:01.680]  And again, I can't overstress.
[1:56:01.680 --> 1:56:06.120]  The paper says one thing, but the mints can't buy it and what their paper allowed to buy
[1:56:06.120 --> 1:56:07.800]  through the treasury.
[1:56:07.800 --> 1:56:11.200]  So their mints all over the world are shutting down, saying, no more gold.
[1:56:11.200 --> 1:56:13.160]  We can't get gold to coin.
[1:56:13.160 --> 1:56:14.160]  Gold currency.
[1:56:14.160 --> 1:56:15.960]  Ted, again, tell them what you've got today.
[1:56:15.960 --> 1:56:19.880]  Well, right now, we have today, and quite literally, we do have the U.S. Eagle currently
[1:56:19.880 --> 1:56:20.880]  right now.
[1:56:20.880 --> 1:56:21.880]  It's at $1,033.
[1:56:21.880 --> 1:56:27.520]  We have also, we have a good selection of the $10 Liberty at $6.53 and $10 Indians,
[1:56:27.520 --> 1:56:32.120]  which usually have a huge premium over $10 liberties that carried just a premium of $20
[1:56:32.120 --> 1:56:33.960]  bucks there at $673.
[1:56:33.960 --> 1:56:36.720]  I presently right now have the Frank Coin.
[1:56:36.720 --> 1:56:39.760]  It's at $194 and the British Sovereign presently right now at this time.
[1:56:39.760 --> 1:56:40.760]  Let's explain.
[1:56:40.760 --> 1:56:45.200]  With gold, people get so spoiled, they expect no profit for you to take it and sell it.
[1:56:45.200 --> 1:56:49.400]  It's at $10 on a coin that literally just allows you to do the transaction.
[1:56:49.400 --> 1:56:50.400]  Well, exactly.
[1:56:50.400 --> 1:56:54.840]  I mean, there's, it's just, it's just down to bare bones, nothing, but the main thing
[1:56:54.840 --> 1:56:55.840]  is-
[1:56:55.840 --> 1:56:56.840]  And why am I doing this right now?
[1:56:56.840 --> 1:57:02.080]  Because there were times, folks, five years ago when Ted mortgaged his house, it almost
[1:57:02.080 --> 1:57:03.640]  ruined his family.
[1:57:03.640 --> 1:57:08.000]  He literally was cleaning the toilets himself, and now that he is in this position, I'm just
[1:57:08.000 --> 1:57:11.280]  trying to support the network, and that's why we're doing this.
[1:57:11.280 --> 1:57:15.960]  And ladies and gentlemen, he's a big outfit, trusted, he's got the gold and silver in hand
[1:57:15.960 --> 1:57:17.960]  right now, and hardly anybody else does.
[1:57:17.960 --> 1:57:19.400]  Ted, give him the number.
[1:57:19.400 --> 1:57:26.800]  It's 1-800-686-2237, again, 1-800-686-2237.
[1:57:26.800 --> 1:57:31.080]  And for the 30 years that I've been in business, there hasn't been a single soul who have sent
[1:57:31.080 --> 1:57:33.800]  their money into me and not received what they've ordered.
[1:57:33.800 --> 1:57:35.840]  That's probably why they still trust me.
[1:57:35.840 --> 1:57:40.240]  And I can guarantee you, if you buy something from me and you send your check into Midas
[1:57:40.240 --> 1:57:43.440]  Resources, you're going to get that gold and silver you ordered.
[1:57:43.440 --> 1:57:47.680]  And I remember people bitching and complaining years ago, when gold would be 400, then it
[1:57:47.680 --> 1:57:49.800]  dropped to 350, and then go up to 600.
[1:57:49.800 --> 1:57:52.160]  Now how are you sitting out there, folks?
[1:57:52.160 --> 1:57:53.160]  What did gold do?
[1:57:53.160 --> 1:57:55.200]  We told you, move into it now.
[1:57:55.200 --> 1:57:56.200]  It is the safest bet.
[1:57:56.200 --> 1:57:57.200]  Is it 100%?
[1:57:57.200 --> 1:57:59.000]  No, it's only 99%.
[1:57:59.000 --> 1:58:04.240]  All the major analysts are now saying $2,000 of gold oil, gold.
[1:58:04.240 --> 1:58:07.000]  You are insane if you don't move into gold and silver now.
[1:58:07.000 --> 1:58:11.120]  You know, an asteroid could hit the earth tomorrow, but barring that, this is the safest
[1:58:11.120 --> 1:58:19.200]  investment there is 1-800-686-2237, 1-800-686-2237.
[1:58:19.200 --> 1:58:20.640]  Ted, how long can you hold those deals?
[1:58:20.640 --> 1:58:24.520]  I will hold these, definitely, till midnight tonight, until then tomorrow, we'll see what
[1:58:24.520 --> 1:58:26.680]  the market will bring for us.
[1:58:26.680 --> 1:58:32.920]  800-686-2237, I am Alex Jones, I'm back up, both our ISD and Hookups to Minnesota knocked
[1:58:32.920 --> 1:58:33.920]  out.
[1:58:33.920 --> 1:58:41.800]  We'll be right back with the third hour with Bev Harris, get her on the horn.
[1:58:41.800 --> 1:58:44.280]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[1:58:44.280 --> 1:58:50.200]  Be sure to visit GCNLive.com today.
[1:58:50.200 --> 1:58:55.400]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war
[1:58:55.400 --> 1:58:56.880]  against this country.
[1:58:56.880 --> 1:59:01.120]  The enemy struck America on September 11th, but who is the enemy?
[1:59:01.120 --> 1:59:02.120]  Bin Laden.
[1:59:02.120 --> 1:59:03.120]  This is his MO.
[1:59:03.120 --> 1:59:06.200]  We have to look to the Middle East, we have to look to Osama bin Laden.
[1:59:06.200 --> 1:59:10.880]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence
[1:59:10.880 --> 1:59:13.480]  networks inside the United States.
[1:59:13.480 --> 1:59:17.960]  Some US investigators believe that there are Israelis, again, very much engaged in spying
[1:59:17.960 --> 1:59:20.120]  in and on the US.
[1:59:20.120 --> 1:59:23.760]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[1:59:23.760 --> 1:59:29.280]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers' ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection,
[1:59:29.280 --> 1:59:33.480]  the Israeli intelligence network, warnings in war games, the shadow government, and much,
[1:59:33.480 --> 1:59:34.480]  much more.
[1:59:34.480 --> 1:59:35.480]  Fabled Enemies.
[1:59:35.480 --> 1:59:40.600]  Get the DVD at infowars.com or see it in super high quality along with hundreds of other
[1:59:40.600 --> 1:59:42.600]  titles at prisonplanet.tv.
[1:59:42.600 --> 2:00:08.040]  Well, for the next hour, we have Bev Harris on with us, and you know I'm neurotic about
[2:00:08.040 --> 2:00:14.280]  throwing in points, asking too many questions, she is the premier expert on election fraud,
[2:00:14.280 --> 2:00:20.880]  blackboxvoting.org, the non-profit, her incredible documentary, Hacking Democracy, back on HBO,
[2:00:20.880 --> 2:00:25.920]  proving fraud, proving scams, proving that you can hack these systems, remote control,
[2:00:25.920 --> 2:00:30.280]  thousands of systems, proving it's designed for that, catching them, throwing out the
[2:00:30.280 --> 2:00:32.960]  computer tapes in the trash when they said they didn't have them.
[2:00:32.960 --> 2:00:34.120]  I mean, so much.
[2:00:34.120 --> 2:00:37.920]  So Bev, in the hour we've got together, I'm going to try to really give you the floor.
[2:00:37.920 --> 2:00:40.920]  If you're doing an hour presentation, I'll throw in a few questions here or there or
[2:00:40.920 --> 2:00:47.040]  take us in and out of break, but I want you to really overview the basic history of the
[2:00:47.040 --> 2:00:51.520]  election fraud, not just the new touch screens or systems, but the scantrons that are still
[2:00:51.520 --> 2:00:57.480]  centrally tabulated, where we're going, what happened in the, briefly what happened in
[2:00:57.480 --> 2:01:04.480]  the, you know, some of the anomalies we saw in problems earlier in the campaign this year,
[2:01:04.480 --> 2:01:09.760]  we're going to the primaries, and then now what you're seeing coming up, 27 days away
[2:01:09.760 --> 2:01:15.000]  from the election right now, which again, as you point out in your film that you're
[2:01:15.000 --> 2:01:20.280]  in on HBO, Hacking Democracy, in areas where you've got the Democrats running things, they're
[2:01:20.280 --> 2:01:24.160]  clearly running shenanigans, and where Republicans run things, they're shenanigans.
[2:01:24.160 --> 2:01:30.000]  This is bipartisan fraud going on, and again, you have done such a great job exposing this,
[2:01:30.000 --> 2:01:34.680]  so anything and everything you want to cover, whatever angles, and then right after the
[2:01:34.680 --> 2:01:38.400]  election, she'll also be here with us to analyze what's happened then, because we know what's
[2:01:38.400 --> 2:01:39.400]  going to happen.
[2:01:39.400 --> 2:01:41.240]  Bev Harris, thank you for coming on with us.
[2:01:41.240 --> 2:01:42.240]  Well, great.
[2:01:42.240 --> 2:01:43.840]  It's always good to be here, Alex.
[2:01:43.840 --> 2:01:44.840]  You bet.
[2:01:44.840 --> 2:01:52.000]  Yeah, well, in a nutshell, we converted our whole country, based almost all our whole
[2:01:52.000 --> 2:01:56.040]  country, except for about 600 small population handsets.
[2:01:56.040 --> 2:02:02.560]  We converted it to secret vote counting controlled by government insiders and vendors.
[2:02:02.560 --> 2:02:06.600]  Therefore, we actually transferred power.
[2:02:06.600 --> 2:02:07.760]  This is what we did.
[2:02:07.760 --> 2:02:12.080]  As a citizenry, we used to have control over our elections.
[2:02:12.080 --> 2:02:17.920]  We transferred power to government insiders and vendors.
[2:02:17.920 --> 2:02:23.520]  People kind of act like I'm a radical when I say we don't actually have democratic elections
[2:02:23.520 --> 2:02:26.120]  anymore, but we don't.
[2:02:26.120 --> 2:02:32.360]  This is not the way the country was founded when we say, I'll tell you what, we're going
[2:02:32.360 --> 2:02:37.200]  to trust some insiders to count our votes in secret, but that's what we're really dealing
[2:02:37.200 --> 2:02:39.120]  with right now.
[2:02:39.120 --> 2:02:41.360]  You're absolutely right what you started off with.
[2:02:41.360 --> 2:02:47.080]  Whoever's in power, we're at the mercy of whoever's in power and controls those systems,
[2:02:47.080 --> 2:02:51.600]  which is not a definition of freedom.
[2:02:51.600 --> 2:02:57.840]  It started when we decided that we should use voting machines to vote.
[2:02:57.840 --> 2:03:05.120]  Now, I'm not against technology, but I am against just building something on mechanics
[2:03:05.120 --> 2:03:08.480]  without having a design specification.
[2:03:08.480 --> 2:03:14.320]  It's kind of like we went out and we built a big, big tall building without an architect.
[2:03:14.320 --> 2:03:19.880]  The architect is actually the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution.
[2:03:19.880 --> 2:03:23.400]  It says the people must be sovereign over the government.
[2:03:23.400 --> 2:03:28.680]  They left that part out and they basically made vendors and insiders in the government
[2:03:28.680 --> 2:03:30.880]  sovereign.
[2:03:30.880 --> 2:03:37.800]  Put it into voting machines that those people control and said, here you go, this is our
[2:03:37.800 --> 2:03:38.800]  elections.
[2:03:38.800 --> 2:03:39.800]  We control them.
[2:03:39.800 --> 2:03:40.800]  Trust us.
[2:03:40.800 --> 2:03:44.960]  We've actually ceded power.
[2:03:44.960 --> 2:03:47.960]  A lot of people say, well, what are we going to do for November 2008?
[2:03:47.960 --> 2:03:54.480]  It's like, well, you know what, you ceded power to a bunch of insiders, and we haven't
[2:03:54.480 --> 2:04:03.520]  gotten it back, so there's kind of a bigger picture we can draw in terms of all kinds
[2:04:03.520 --> 2:04:06.120]  of specifics, but in a nutshell, that's what we're dealing with.
[2:04:06.120 --> 2:04:07.120]  All right, Bev, stay there.
[2:04:07.120 --> 2:04:08.120]  Quick break.
[2:04:08.120 --> 2:04:13.720]  For those that don't understand, not only is it non-transparent secret every time Bev
[2:04:13.720 --> 2:04:18.320]  Harris spot checks them, every time, there's fraud, there's chicanery, there's lies.
[2:04:18.320 --> 2:04:23.320]  The systems are designed to be secretly snuck into and then have the visit erased.
[2:04:23.320 --> 2:04:25.200]  I mean, they're designed for fraud.
[2:04:25.200 --> 2:04:26.720]  Bev Harris, straight ahead.
[2:04:26.720 --> 2:04:37.640]  It is a big idea known as the Bilderberg, put their objective to be world domination.
[2:04:37.640 --> 2:04:43.040]  For thousands of years, their dark-water group, now as they hail the birth of the New World
[2:04:43.040 --> 2:04:51.160]  Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[2:04:51.160 --> 2:04:56.160]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[2:04:56.160 --> 2:05:00.480]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[2:05:00.480 --> 2:05:03.160]  Bilderberg is making great progress toward a world economy.
[2:05:03.160 --> 2:05:04.160]  Most people have no idea.
[2:05:04.160 --> 2:05:05.160]  They're not after money.
[2:05:05.160 --> 2:05:06.160]  They have all the money they need.
[2:05:06.160 --> 2:05:07.160]  They're after power.
[2:05:07.160 --> 2:05:08.160]  That's their after-easy.

[2:05:14.920 --> 2:05:15.920]  at prisonplanet.tv.
[2:05:15.920 --> 2:05:23.480]  In-game, blueprint for global enslavement, you have been warned.
[2:05:23.480 --> 2:05:26.640]  You know, I know exactly what you're thinking when it comes to this economy.
[2:05:26.640 --> 2:05:31.480]  The banks are crashing, the stock market's a mess, there's the mortgage crisis, there's
[2:05:31.480 --> 2:05:38.040]  the lending crisis, there is the food and gasoline prices through the ceiling crisis,
[2:05:38.040 --> 2:05:39.480]  and we're paralyzed a little bit.
[2:05:39.480 --> 2:05:41.360]  We don't know exactly how to respond to it.
[2:05:41.360 --> 2:05:42.360]  I don't know what to say.
[2:05:42.360 --> 2:05:43.360]  What can you do?
[2:05:43.360 --> 2:05:44.360]  Do what you can do.
[2:05:44.360 --> 2:05:45.360]  That's what you do.
[2:05:45.360 --> 2:05:46.360]  You do what you can do.
[2:05:46.360 --> 2:05:47.360]  What I can do is I can put some food away.
[2:05:47.360 --> 2:05:49.120]  I know there's a global food shortage.
[2:05:49.120 --> 2:05:50.120]  I can read it.
[2:05:50.120 --> 2:05:52.840]  I can go to efoodsdirect.com, read hundreds of articles about this.
[2:05:52.840 --> 2:05:57.200]  I can go up on the Google website and Google food shortage and see the world's a mess.
[2:05:57.200 --> 2:05:58.200]  I know it.
[2:05:58.200 --> 2:05:59.200]  You know it.
[2:05:59.200 --> 2:06:00.200]  Look at the prices.
[2:06:00.200 --> 2:06:01.200]  Look where they're headed.
[2:06:01.200 --> 2:06:02.200]  Be prepared.
[2:06:02.200 --> 2:06:03.200]  Take care of yourself.
[2:06:03.200 --> 2:06:05.760]  You owe your family some security, some sense of self being a little bit of self reliance
[2:06:05.760 --> 2:06:07.120]  is a good idea right now.

[2:07:24.080 --> 2:07:30.640]  From his central Texas command center deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[2:07:30.640 --> 2:07:35.520]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[2:07:35.520 --> 2:07:40.200]  We have come a long way when I was talking about election fraud with the Collier Brothers
[2:07:40.200 --> 2:07:43.600]  13 years ago on air and they've been doing it for a decade before that.
[2:07:43.600 --> 2:07:49.440]  It didn't matter if they had video of the League of Women Voters falsifying the ballots
[2:07:49.440 --> 2:07:53.320]  by hand in Florida, the news media wouldn't air it.
[2:07:53.320 --> 2:07:58.000]  But today we have the internet and people like Bev Harris who's a corporate fraud investigator,
[2:07:58.000 --> 2:07:59.000]  an auditor.
[2:07:59.000 --> 2:08:04.160]  Well, she decided to look into it years ago and it's been quite a saga and I know it's
[2:08:04.160 --> 2:08:06.080]  hard for some of you other to believe this is happening.
[2:08:06.080 --> 2:08:10.320]  It's also hard to believe that the Goldman Sachs former head and his deputy are running
[2:08:10.320 --> 2:08:16.280]  the entire bailout handing tens of billions personally to their own companies.
[2:08:16.280 --> 2:08:17.280]  But it's happening.
[2:08:17.280 --> 2:08:21.880]  Every law, every canon of a free society, every check and balance gone.
[2:08:21.880 --> 2:08:27.200]  Die bold, hard on your civics, Sequoia, all caught.
[2:08:27.200 --> 2:08:28.200]  It's unbelievable.
[2:08:28.200 --> 2:08:31.800]  So Bev Harris, I'm going to turn my mic off, I'm going to sit back and we're going to
[2:08:31.800 --> 2:08:37.600]  go directly to you, blackboxvoting.org to, I know the listeners know about this, but
[2:08:37.600 --> 2:08:41.240]  do your friends, your family, your neighbors, and do you really think you know, you know,
[2:08:41.240 --> 2:08:43.680]  I've seen hacking democracy twice.
[2:08:43.680 --> 2:08:47.480]  And as I said yesterday in the morning, as I was thinking about getting Bev on, I was
[2:08:47.480 --> 2:08:52.200]  on the treadmill, I limit to be on 30 minutes, ended up being on an hour, watching HBO in
[2:08:52.200 --> 2:08:55.960]  the garage with Bev Harris on it.
[2:08:55.960 --> 2:09:01.600]  And that's where I got my equipment, don't have room in the house and I'm in there watching
[2:09:01.600 --> 2:09:02.600]  her.
[2:09:02.600 --> 2:09:05.360]  And it's just, I, even though I'd seen all this, even though I knew this, even before
[2:09:05.360 --> 2:09:08.600]  this stuff was in the film, I'd seen it on YouTube and Google, you know, a little clip
[2:09:08.600 --> 2:09:13.200]  she put out in pieces, seeing it, just an hour of it.
[2:09:13.200 --> 2:09:18.440]  And that stuff years ago, what this woman's done with her helpers and people supporting
[2:09:18.440 --> 2:09:20.360]  her is to people to prison.
[2:09:20.360 --> 2:09:22.800]  So financially support her, support us.
[2:09:22.800 --> 2:09:26.480]  We're here, the alternative media going toe to toe with the military industrial complex.
[2:09:26.480 --> 2:09:30.880]  So as Bev said, we don't have voting for all intents and purposes.
[2:09:30.880 --> 2:09:37.360]  You know, one of the really great people working on this issue, a lawyer by the name of Paul
[2:09:37.360 --> 2:09:43.200]  Leto, and he said the other day in discussing what we're really dealing with, he said,
[2:09:43.200 --> 2:09:47.000]  you know, if one can keep their head while those around them are losing theirs, perhaps
[2:09:47.000 --> 2:09:51.520]  they don't quite understand the full extent of the problem.
[2:09:51.520 --> 2:09:58.080]  And I have to agree, people come to this slowly because I think it's something they don't
[2:09:58.080 --> 2:09:59.080]  want to see.
[2:09:59.080 --> 2:10:03.320]  It's like we want to believe we have the best country, we've been told that since we've
[2:10:03.320 --> 2:10:04.320]  been children.
[2:10:04.320 --> 2:10:09.240]  We have the best and goodest and most virtuous, and we do have that.
[2:10:09.240 --> 2:10:12.440]  If you look at the people that are involved in this country.
[2:10:12.440 --> 2:10:14.640]  But it's because we're so good.
[2:10:14.640 --> 2:10:18.040]  But we don't have that in terms of the system.
[2:10:18.040 --> 2:10:25.120]  People have the idea that they think that we have these systems that have checks and
[2:10:25.120 --> 2:10:26.120]  balances.
[2:10:26.120 --> 2:10:29.800]  What's so interesting is when I first started studying this, people said, well, don't worry
[2:10:29.800 --> 2:10:33.800]  about the flaws with the voting machines because we have checks and balances that would catch
[2:10:33.800 --> 2:10:34.800]  it.
[2:10:34.800 --> 2:10:38.000]  So I spent the last two years evaluating the checks and balances.
[2:10:38.000 --> 2:10:39.800]  They don't use them.
[2:10:39.800 --> 2:10:44.920]  The checks and balances are every bit as broken down as the voting machine system.
[2:10:44.920 --> 2:10:49.160]  So then they say, well, it's not that important that the seals weren't on the thing and that
[2:10:49.160 --> 2:10:50.440]  the seal numbers didn't match.
[2:10:50.440 --> 2:10:54.800]  It's like, well, wait a minute, you're telling me that it's okay if the machines are defective
[2:10:54.800 --> 2:10:58.280]  because you have checks and balances, and now you're telling me the checks and balances
[2:10:58.280 --> 2:10:59.280]  aren't that important.
[2:10:59.280 --> 2:11:03.320]  What you're really telling me is don't trust the system.
[2:11:03.320 --> 2:11:08.760]  Well, I want you to start over, but I want you to roll through all of this because it's
[2:11:08.760 --> 2:11:09.760]  so incredible.
[2:11:09.760 --> 2:11:11.840]  But what you just said, I want to restate that.
[2:11:11.840 --> 2:11:16.280]  It's like coming home, opening your door up, and the couches, the TVs, everything has been
[2:11:16.280 --> 2:11:17.680]  stolen.
[2:11:17.680 --> 2:11:21.480]  People have come in on the weekend in a few hours and taken everything.
[2:11:21.480 --> 2:11:26.080]  Stories like that happen every day in every city, and you're in shock, and exactly because
[2:11:26.080 --> 2:11:31.720]  the general public are good, they can't imagine they're actually being taken at every level
[2:11:31.720 --> 2:11:32.720]  by a criminal tyranny.
[2:11:32.720 --> 2:11:34.200]  Now, I'm going to shut up.
[2:11:34.200 --> 2:11:35.720]  Go ahead and walk through that.
[2:11:35.720 --> 2:11:42.560]  Well, even I think one of the things that sometimes helps, people get excited when we
[2:11:42.560 --> 2:11:48.960]  talk about fraud, but we don't even have to prove fraud because what got taken away from
[2:11:48.960 --> 2:11:53.920]  us was the ability to control the system at all.
[2:11:53.920 --> 2:11:59.800]  It's like, suppose you own a small business and you are told you're not going to be allowed
[2:11:59.800 --> 2:12:07.080]  to see what your bookkeeper did with the money, you're just not allowed to see it.
[2:12:07.080 --> 2:12:10.560]  Obviously, you don't own that business anymore, right?
[2:12:10.560 --> 2:12:11.560]  You really don't.
[2:12:11.560 --> 2:12:12.560]  Your bookkeeper owns it.
[2:12:12.560 --> 2:12:18.200]  The situation we've got in the US is that we don't have control anymore.
[2:12:18.200 --> 2:12:23.800]  Of course, when you don't control it and people can gain power and money when they
[2:12:23.800 --> 2:12:29.880]  do control it, those people will commit crimes and those people will commit fraud.
[2:12:29.880 --> 2:12:31.680]  It's how it's going to happen.
[2:12:31.680 --> 2:12:40.760]  Some of them will be honest, but it's not freedom to have to depend on insiders being
[2:12:40.760 --> 2:12:43.440]  honest and benevolent.
[2:12:43.440 --> 2:12:45.280]  That's not freedom.
[2:12:45.280 --> 2:12:51.080]  What we have to understand is, right now, the system we've got took away our fundamental
[2:12:51.080 --> 2:12:54.800]  civil rights and took away our freedoms.
[2:12:54.800 --> 2:13:01.640]  Until we get control of the election system again, no amount of, well, this election official
[2:13:01.640 --> 2:13:02.640]  is honest.
[2:13:02.640 --> 2:13:03.640]  She's a good one.
[2:13:03.640 --> 2:13:04.640]  Don't worry about her.
[2:13:04.640 --> 2:13:05.960]  That is not the point.
[2:13:05.960 --> 2:13:09.640]  The point is we have to be able to control the system.
[2:13:09.640 --> 2:13:14.160]  It's just exactly like if you are a business owner and someone says, well, you can't see
[2:13:14.160 --> 2:13:19.000]  what happened to your money, but trust me, your bookkeeper is a nice lady, but none
[2:13:19.000 --> 2:13:24.000]  of us would accept that, or sometimes they say, we're going to propose a system now.
[2:13:24.000 --> 2:13:28.160]  Boy, the mitigations they come up with are just even dumber than the problem.
[2:13:28.160 --> 2:13:33.160]  They've got one now where the guy, some scientist from Stanford, is saying, well, I've got one
[2:13:33.160 --> 2:13:39.640]  where you can check your own vote and it relies on invisible ink to make sure it's secure.
[2:13:39.640 --> 2:13:45.480]  And I'm thinking, okay, so that sounds a little bit like the emperor's new clothes.
[2:13:45.480 --> 2:13:47.240]  Invisible ink and you can check one vote.
[2:13:47.240 --> 2:13:53.280]  If you own a business, imagine if they say, you can check one transaction, that's all.
[2:13:53.280 --> 2:13:56.880]  And your bank will just tell you what you have in the bank besides that.
[2:13:56.880 --> 2:13:57.880]  Just trust them.
[2:13:57.880 --> 2:14:01.760]  So, you know, we've got a situation where we've lost control of it.
[2:14:01.760 --> 2:14:07.280]  And until we regain control, people will be cheating, of course, because there's power
[2:14:07.280 --> 2:14:11.200]  and money, and they've always cheated in elections, and even when they were very open
[2:14:11.200 --> 2:14:18.040]  and public, you know, LBJ back in 1948, got caught cheating in Texas.
[2:14:18.040 --> 2:14:25.480]  So it's nothing new, but what is new is that they have removed public control.
[2:14:25.480 --> 2:14:31.200]  So, ask me a question, Alex.
[2:14:31.200 --> 2:14:36.400]  Well, Bev, I mean, I'm just listening to you, I want you to walk through this for people.
[2:14:36.400 --> 2:14:39.960]  I mean, you like to prove the fact that it can't be confirmed and it's designed so it
[2:14:39.960 --> 2:14:42.480]  can be covered up, but you have caught them cheating.
[2:14:42.480 --> 2:14:45.320]  You have caught them violating things.
[2:14:45.320 --> 2:14:50.040]  You have caught them rigging votes, and the polls come out, which were always accurate
[2:14:50.040 --> 2:14:55.400]  in the past in the exit polls, showing that somebody's going to win, but of their anti-establishment,
[2:14:55.400 --> 2:14:56.400]  they lose.
[2:14:56.400 --> 2:14:59.960]  And it's the perfect system because once you've stolen the right to vote, once you have the
[2:14:59.960 --> 2:15:05.840]  fraud in place, it's hard for the people to ever throw the Eraskels out because they're
[2:15:05.840 --> 2:15:07.160]  in control of the whole system.
[2:15:07.160 --> 2:15:08.160]  Right.
[2:15:08.160 --> 2:15:09.160]  That's the key.
[2:15:09.160 --> 2:15:12.360]  I mean, you have to have a system where you can throw the bombs out if they're bombs,
[2:15:12.360 --> 2:15:13.360]  right?
[2:15:13.360 --> 2:15:16.720]  A lot of times I have people come to me and say, well, the system is actually going to
[2:15:16.720 --> 2:15:20.520]  be, it's okay in Oregon because we have a good Secretary of State and we really like
[2:15:20.520 --> 2:15:24.280]  our mail-in voting, and our election official is honest.
[2:15:24.280 --> 2:15:30.720]  And when I tell them, okay, take your Oregon election system and take it to Kentucky, where
[2:15:30.720 --> 2:15:35.440]  we still have, you know, Festus and Buford sometimes running the local government with
[2:15:35.440 --> 2:15:40.320]  their family, and sometimes the sheriff is the drug dealer.
[2:15:40.320 --> 2:15:43.040]  And tell me if your Oregon system works there.
[2:15:43.040 --> 2:15:48.080]  Well, they always admit, well, no, it won't work if the insider is crooked.
[2:15:48.080 --> 2:15:50.080]  Well then, it's not acceptable.
[2:15:50.080 --> 2:15:52.880]  It has to be in public view, the whole thing.
[2:15:52.880 --> 2:15:57.800]  And you're right, you know, we have caught situations where there's fraud, but the bigger
[2:15:57.800 --> 2:16:03.440]  problem is that because they're counting in secret, they have set it up so that it's
[2:16:03.440 --> 2:16:07.920]  impossible to prove whether there was fraud or not.
[2:16:07.920 --> 2:16:14.440]  So you see, we've actually lost something bigger than just, oh, they've created a tamperable
[2:16:14.440 --> 2:16:15.440]  system.
[2:16:15.440 --> 2:16:20.440]  And this is an important point because people think when they want to solve it, they go,
[2:16:20.440 --> 2:16:23.440]  oh, let's just build a more secure computer.
[2:16:23.440 --> 2:16:27.480]  But it doesn't actually solve it until you put the public back in control.
[2:16:27.480 --> 2:16:31.480]  But then you find out with the computers, with the systems, they've set it up so they
[2:16:31.480 --> 2:16:34.880]  can remotely access it and cover up they were even there.
[2:16:34.880 --> 2:16:40.880]  Then you go get the trash in county after county and you get the real paperwork that
[2:16:40.880 --> 2:16:44.320]  shows that it was the opposite of what they said.
[2:16:44.320 --> 2:16:49.320]  I mean, you have caught them and people have gone to jail for rigging elections and we know
[2:16:49.320 --> 2:16:54.440]  it's going on and they've, it's just so amazing to watch.
[2:16:54.440 --> 2:16:59.440]  But what they will do, you see, is just make it harder to catch them by making it so that
[2:16:59.440 --> 2:17:01.080]  we can see even less information.
[2:17:01.080 --> 2:17:02.080]  Or they have.
[2:17:02.080 --> 2:17:05.280]  Or their solution is going to be, let's hide more information.
[2:17:05.280 --> 2:17:06.600]  Well, I agree.
[2:17:06.600 --> 2:17:09.800]  And then we've had the state commissions, I mean, I remember here in Texas, we caught
[2:17:09.800 --> 2:17:10.800]  them an election fraud.
[2:17:10.800 --> 2:17:16.040]  They said double counting ballot boxes, falsifying signatures, raking safety seals, double counting
[2:17:16.040 --> 2:17:19.080]  boxes, and then the state said it was an accident.
[2:17:19.080 --> 2:17:21.600]  Oh, oh, I'm glad you brought that up.
[2:17:21.600 --> 2:17:24.360]  I call it the oops excuse.
[2:17:24.360 --> 2:17:29.160]  I have less polite words for it, but let's call it that.
[2:17:29.160 --> 2:17:31.960]  And you see, it's like running out the clock.
[2:17:31.960 --> 2:17:36.640]  It's like if in basketball, you could, you know, commit a foul and say oops and then
[2:17:36.640 --> 2:17:41.280]  run out the clock and get your basket anyway and then say, but my basket still counts because
[2:17:41.280 --> 2:17:47.480]  it was an accident that I ran over that guy, you know, they, elections are all about running
[2:17:47.480 --> 2:17:49.080]  out the clock.
[2:17:49.080 --> 2:17:53.680]  So in politics, they do anything they can get away with and say oops if they possibly
[2:17:53.680 --> 2:17:54.680]  can.
[2:17:54.680 --> 2:17:59.080]  So they like to set things up so that it has plausible deniability.
[2:17:59.080 --> 2:18:01.520]  And you should see the oops excuses.
[2:18:01.520 --> 2:18:09.480]  They're ridiculous in New Mexico, in the primary of, now, we have the voting machines that
[2:18:09.480 --> 2:18:12.600]  was pushed in through the Help America vote after I call it.
[2:18:12.600 --> 2:18:15.880]  The feds pay to put the fraud machines in 2004.
[2:18:15.880 --> 2:18:16.880]  It's in the film.
[2:18:16.880 --> 2:18:22.040]  Carrie even admitted that, well, wait a minute, the exit polls all show I won, but I won everywhere
[2:18:22.040 --> 2:18:25.600]  except where we have the computer machines and everywhere they're, he lost.
[2:18:25.600 --> 2:18:26.600]  Right.
[2:18:26.600 --> 2:18:31.680]  Well, now let's, we, we start, we put the voting machines in, in, with, with the help
[2:18:31.680 --> 2:18:33.640]  America vote act.
[2:18:33.640 --> 2:18:35.400]  And there was two parts to it.
[2:18:35.400 --> 2:18:40.840]  The second part is going to come to play for the first time in 2008.
[2:18:40.840 --> 2:18:46.600]  And that is, in addition to having the voting machines, we now have for the first time in
[2:18:46.600 --> 2:18:52.320]  every stage, a statewide centralized database of the voters.
[2:18:52.320 --> 2:18:57.520]  Now, these databases could really be messed within New Mexico in the primary.
[2:18:57.520 --> 2:19:00.440]  A whole bunch of people couldn't vote because they weren't on the list.
[2:19:00.440 --> 2:19:01.440]  That's right.
[2:19:01.440 --> 2:19:02.440]  We're always coming to the wrong list.
[2:19:02.440 --> 2:19:03.440]  We've got a break.
[2:19:03.440 --> 2:19:04.440]  We've got a break.
[2:19:04.440 --> 2:19:05.440]  Stay there.
[2:19:05.440 --> 2:19:06.440]  We'll come back and explain this.
[2:19:06.440 --> 2:19:09.400]  Folks, it isn't just that they're stealing votes and flipping votes with the computers
[2:19:09.400 --> 2:19:10.640]  and cheating people.
[2:19:10.640 --> 2:19:13.680]  Now they're, they've always done this, but now in a greater extent, they're throwing
[2:19:13.680 --> 2:19:17.160]  people off who aren't felons, who aren't criminals.
[2:19:17.160 --> 2:19:22.040]  So they're also using computers with the databases of voters to keep people from voting.
[2:19:22.040 --> 2:19:23.040]  Stay with us.
[2:19:23.040 --> 2:19:27.840]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war
[2:19:27.840 --> 2:19:29.340]  against this country.
[2:19:29.340 --> 2:19:31.560]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[2:19:31.560 --> 2:19:33.560]  But who is the enemy?
[2:19:33.560 --> 2:19:34.560]  Bin Laden.
[2:19:34.560 --> 2:19:35.560]  This is his M.O.
[2:19:35.560 --> 2:19:36.560]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[2:19:36.560 --> 2:19:38.880]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[2:19:38.880 --> 2:19:43.320]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence
[2:19:43.320 --> 2:19:45.920]  networks inside the United States.
[2:19:45.920 --> 2:19:50.400]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying
[2:19:50.400 --> 2:19:52.560]  in and on the U.S.
[2:19:52.560 --> 2:19:56.120]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[2:19:56.120 --> 2:20:01.720]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers' ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection,
[2:20:01.720 --> 2:20:05.520]  the Israeli intelligence network, warnings in war games, the shadow government, and
[2:20:05.520 --> 2:20:06.880]  much, much more.
[2:20:06.880 --> 2:20:07.880]  Fabled Enemies.

[2:20:27.200 --> 2:20:31.360]  a story about two people who are faced with the challenge to stand up and do the right
[2:20:31.360 --> 2:20:32.360]  thing for liberty.
[2:20:32.360 --> 2:20:38.160]  Her face was, every face I've ever known, her face was my own face.

[2:23:20.200 --> 2:23:38.000]  Let's go right back to Bev Harris as she continues to break down the different ways
[2:23:38.000 --> 2:23:43.400]  they're disenfranchising voters, not just at the ballot box, but keeping them from getting
[2:23:43.400 --> 2:23:44.400]  to the ballot box.
[2:23:44.400 --> 2:23:49.680]  And then I want to go through all the evidence of tampering and where she sees this election
[2:23:49.680 --> 2:23:51.880]  going up that we're less than a month away from.
[2:23:51.880 --> 2:23:52.880]  Bev Harris?
[2:23:52.880 --> 2:23:53.880]  Yeah.
[2:23:53.880 --> 2:23:58.320]  Yeah, well it's not even, you know, people often talk about these voter lists as keeping
[2:23:58.320 --> 2:24:01.880]  people from the ballot, but it's actually worse than that.
[2:24:01.880 --> 2:24:07.240]  What they have is the ability to turn on and off people's eligibility in the middle of
[2:24:07.240 --> 2:24:08.240]  an election.
[2:24:08.240 --> 2:24:16.320]  So, let me kind of run down some examples that I have been able to prove out, okay?
[2:24:16.320 --> 2:24:24.160]  In Georgia, in 2006, elderly people, senior citizens, were coming into the polls and they
[2:24:24.160 --> 2:24:28.720]  were trying to vote and they were told, you've already voted.
[2:24:28.720 --> 2:24:31.040]  And of course, so that would disenfranchise them, right?
[2:24:31.040 --> 2:24:35.880]  Well some of the elderly people really asserted themselves and they said, no, you know, I
[2:24:35.880 --> 2:24:37.600]  know I haven't voted.
[2:24:37.600 --> 2:24:41.400]  And so they said, so they would call up and ask what to do, the poll workers.
[2:24:41.400 --> 2:24:44.080]  This is according to the poll workers' own notes.
[2:24:44.080 --> 2:24:47.360]  And they were told, tell them to come back this afternoon.
[2:24:47.360 --> 2:24:52.480]  So, the senior citizens came back that afternoon and, lo and behold, they said, oh, you can
[2:24:52.480 --> 2:24:55.040]  vote, you haven't already voted.
[2:24:55.040 --> 2:24:59.960]  Now what that tells you, they were using an electronic poll book, which was interfacing
[2:24:59.960 --> 2:25:05.080]  with the electronic database that's held by the state now that's centralized.
[2:25:05.080 --> 2:25:11.120]  And what that tells you is that they were able to turn on and off these people's eligibility
[2:25:11.120 --> 2:25:12.120]  during the middle of the vote.
[2:25:12.120 --> 2:25:16.960]  So they would have a bunch of eligibility turned off targeting senior citizens, thinking
[2:25:16.960 --> 2:25:20.360]  they might forget or not be assertive, I suppose.
[2:25:20.360 --> 2:25:24.280]  And if they asserted themselves, they could turn it back on again.
[2:25:24.280 --> 2:25:31.040]  Now in Lake County, Indiana, and this, I think what we need to look at these databases as
[2:25:31.040 --> 2:25:34.280]  is a room full of on and off switches.
[2:25:34.280 --> 2:25:40.280]  In Lake County, Indiana, they had a number of absentee ballots which they had ruled ineligible.
[2:25:40.280 --> 2:25:45.520]  They come in and all of a sudden one day, they see that this is shortly after the election,
[2:25:45.520 --> 2:25:50.680]  they see that they're all eligible because the absentee ballots, whether they're eligible
[2:25:50.680 --> 2:25:54.040]  or ineligible, is in a computer program now.
[2:25:54.040 --> 2:25:57.720]  And they're all, all these ineligible were made eligible.
[2:25:57.720 --> 2:26:03.400]  So they contacted the state because they knew they didn't do it in Lake County, Indiana.
[2:26:03.400 --> 2:26:06.800]  It was done remotely from the state database.
[2:26:06.800 --> 2:26:11.360]  The vendor for the state database admitted it and said they were just testing something,
[2:26:11.360 --> 2:26:15.720]  it didn't affect the results.
[2:26:15.720 --> 2:26:17.480]  Now how scary is that?
[2:26:17.480 --> 2:26:24.640]  Basically, you have someone at a switchboard who can activate and deactivate absentee ballots
[2:26:24.640 --> 2:26:29.840]  in the middle of an election during the count and you have somebody who can activate and
[2:26:29.840 --> 2:26:35.040]  deactivate a person's eligibility to vote in the middle of election day.
[2:26:35.040 --> 2:26:42.080]  That's what these voter databases are really enabling.
[2:26:42.080 --> 2:26:49.280]  Now Bev, there are also other things like, and it's always in key demographics, if Democrats
[2:26:49.280 --> 2:26:55.520]  are controlling a county or a voting district, magically in the Republican areas, they'll
[2:26:55.520 --> 2:27:00.520]  give them a tenth of the machines that are needed for the average voter turnout.
[2:27:00.520 --> 2:27:05.960]  But then in the Democratic areas, there'll be plenty of machines, vice versa, like Ohio,
[2:27:05.960 --> 2:27:09.240]  in areas where they know it's going to go, you know, nine to one, say a black area for
[2:27:09.240 --> 2:27:13.840]  John Kerry, magically there's two machines for 10,000 people.
[2:27:13.840 --> 2:27:16.880]  And then in the Republican area, there's a machine for every thousand.
[2:27:16.880 --> 2:27:19.840]  So there's all sorts of, of tricks that are being played here.
[2:27:19.840 --> 2:27:29.240]  And then you also expose weird cash payments by the Republican party that are made to die
[2:27:29.240 --> 2:27:34.360]  bold in others at a county-by-county basis that aren't campaign contributions right before
[2:27:34.360 --> 2:27:35.360]  elections.
[2:27:35.360 --> 2:27:36.360]  I mean, this is amazing.
[2:27:36.360 --> 2:27:37.360]  Right.
[2:27:37.360 --> 2:27:38.360]  Right.
[2:27:38.360 --> 2:27:42.720]  Well, and, you know, there were also very large cash contributions from Diebold to Ken
[2:27:42.720 --> 2:27:43.720]  Blackwell.
[2:27:43.720 --> 2:27:47.320]  He got the stock, I guess, that he was given and so forth.
[2:27:47.320 --> 2:27:51.680]  But let's go back to what you were talking about at the, you see, before we got to the
[2:27:51.680 --> 2:27:58.480]  cash contributions, you had something I wanted to address and it was, oh golly, it's already
[2:27:58.480 --> 2:28:00.520]  flipped my mind what I wanted to say.
[2:28:00.520 --> 2:28:01.520]  But...
[2:28:01.520 --> 2:28:04.600]  Well, let me remind you, I was talking about how they would have less machines.
[2:28:04.600 --> 2:28:06.440]  Oh yeah, that's what I wanted to address.
[2:28:06.440 --> 2:28:12.400]  This is going to be really interesting because in some of this stuff it's just stupid.
[2:28:12.400 --> 2:28:13.400]  It's not criminal.
[2:28:13.400 --> 2:28:15.000]  It's just stupid.
[2:28:15.000 --> 2:28:19.240]  What they did was they, they decided that everybody had to go out and buy these touchscreen
[2:28:19.240 --> 2:28:21.120]  and DRE voting machines in Texas.
[2:28:21.120 --> 2:28:24.320]  You use a lot of heart, which is a dial-a-vote thing.
[2:28:24.320 --> 2:28:28.600]  And it takes a certain amount of time for each person to vote on those machines because
[2:28:28.600 --> 2:28:31.080]  they have to monopolize the machine while they're on it.
[2:28:31.080 --> 2:28:34.520]  It's not like the paper ballots where they can go off in a corner and then just run it
[2:28:34.520 --> 2:28:35.520]  through later.
[2:28:35.520 --> 2:28:41.000]  Well, what they did not anticipate is an election that might have a higher turnout.
[2:28:41.000 --> 2:28:45.960]  So they only allocated not even enough money to buy the machines and not enough to buy
[2:28:45.960 --> 2:28:49.920]  the machines for a high turnout.
[2:28:49.920 --> 2:28:53.280]  Bev Harris, we're going to come back a long segment coming up, plenty of time to break
[2:28:53.280 --> 2:28:54.280]  it down.
[2:28:54.280 --> 2:28:59.760]  We're going to get into what you see happening in the election in 27 days.
[2:28:59.760 --> 2:29:03.880]  In hindsight, integrating the information we have from the primaries just six, seven
[2:29:03.880 --> 2:29:09.360]  months ago and all the shenanigans and activities we saw there and then ways to counter this
[2:29:09.360 --> 2:29:12.960]  solutions.
[2:29:12.960 --> 2:29:19.560]  We're on the march, the empires on the run, Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[2:29:19.560 --> 2:29:24.560]  May I have everybody's attention, please?
[2:29:24.560 --> 2:29:29.560]  I've come with a message of information, 9-11 was an inside job.
[2:29:29.560 --> 2:29:31.160]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[2:29:31.160 --> 2:29:32.560]  Do you like being a puppet from the New World Order?
[2:29:32.560 --> 2:29:35.560]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was the stage?
[2:29:35.560 --> 2:29:39.560]  It was engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CIFAR.
[2:29:39.560 --> 2:29:46.560]  The day that we stop asking questions is the day that we have allowed the seeds of despotism
[2:29:46.560 --> 2:29:48.560]  to grow at our own door.
[2:29:48.560 --> 2:29:54.560]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11, a global awakening has taken place.
[2:29:54.560 --> 2:29:57.560]  An inside job?
[2:29:57.560 --> 2:30:01.560]  How dare you?
[2:30:01.560 --> 2:30:04.560]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[2:30:04.560 --> 2:30:07.560]  Well, Helen, it's breaking news on 6th Avenue.
[2:30:07.560 --> 2:30:12.560]  And if the government has not told the truth in five years, we will be here on the 10th
[2:30:12.560 --> 2:30:13.560]  anniversary of 9-11.
[2:30:13.560 --> 2:30:19.560]  Download the film at prisonplanet.tv right now or get the DVD at infowars.com.
[2:30:19.560 --> 2:30:22.560]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[2:30:22.560 --> 2:30:25.560]  You ever have one of those days where everything goes right?
[2:30:25.560 --> 2:30:27.560]  First, I get the best parking space at work.
[2:30:27.560 --> 2:30:31.560]  Tonight, I have a date with a very lovely Rachel.
[2:30:31.560 --> 2:30:35.560]  And today, I gave a killer presentation in Sydney, finalized the contract in London,
[2:30:35.560 --> 2:30:40.560]  and demoed our new product in Boston, online from my desk with WebEx.
[2:30:40.560 --> 2:30:43.560]  WebEx lets me take meetings and give presentations from my desk.
[2:30:43.560 --> 2:30:48.560]  I just talk to clients on the phone and they watch what's happening on my desktop from their desktop.
[2:30:48.560 --> 2:30:52.560]  So I can travel the world and still be here for my date tonight with Rachel.
[2:30:52.560 --> 2:30:54.560]  Travel less, meet online.
[2:30:54.560 --> 2:30:56.560]  Go to WebEx.com and try WebEx free.

[2:31:21.560 --> 2:31:27.560]  Lead from solder and copper pipes, mercury from fish, dental fillings, vaccines, arsenic in the water.
[2:31:27.560 --> 2:31:31.560]  These heavy metal toxins are difficult or even impossible to avoid.
[2:31:31.560 --> 2:31:35.560]  Even trace amounts of these heavy metals over time can impact your health.
[2:31:35.560 --> 2:31:47.560]  Many health problems have been suggested as being related to this heavy metal exposure including memory loss, high blood pressure, depression, mood swings, speech disorders, neuropathy, autoimmune diseases, chronic fatigue and more.
[2:31:47.560 --> 2:31:53.560]  Unfortunately, traditional detoxifying isn't able to clear the body of these harmful and potentially deadly toxins.
[2:31:53.560 --> 2:31:56.560]  That's why there's PuraClear from Ripple Creek.
[2:31:56.560 --> 2:32:01.560]  PuraClear contains a proprietary blend of ingredients including a cilantro extract and alphalipoic acid.
[2:32:01.560 --> 2:32:14.560]  Among other ingredients formulated specifically to promote body cleansing, PuraClear also has ingredients selected to promote improved circulation to enhance activity so that heavy metals may be more effectively captured and removed from the body.

[2:32:22.560 --> 2:32:28.560]  Music
[2:32:28.560 --> 2:32:32.560]  Okay, Bev Harris, we've only got about 20 minutes left with you.
[2:32:32.560 --> 2:32:37.560]  Let's break down the rest of the story.
[2:32:37.560 --> 2:32:42.560]  As they say, people can find out more at blackboxvoting.org.
[2:32:42.560 --> 2:32:46.560]  They can also go to Amazon, other places and buy the great film Hacking Democracy.
[2:32:46.560 --> 2:32:53.560]  We have HBO, it's airing every couple days on HBO, watch it and understand it's far worse than even that film covers.
[2:32:53.560 --> 2:33:04.560]  But again, we need more Americans like Bev Harris and her cohorts going out, digging through the trash, always finding bad stuff at these voting systems companies, at the counties where the voting's happening.
[2:33:04.560 --> 2:33:13.560]  Go through the fraud we saw in the primary, what you see it building up to now, other facets, other areas we haven't gotten into and then most importantly solutions.
[2:33:13.560 --> 2:33:21.560]  The positive news that I've got for everybody here today is this.
[2:33:21.560 --> 2:33:26.560]  Ten years ago, you'd see polls, almost no one thought there was election fraud.
[2:33:26.560 --> 2:33:29.560]  Now over 90% major polls say they know it's a fraud.
[2:33:29.560 --> 2:33:35.560]  And so the good news is the establishment is not selling the lie that they're not engaging in orchestrated takeover.
[2:33:35.560 --> 2:33:39.560]  So before you leave us, let's get into that or you can tackle that positive thing now.
[2:33:39.560 --> 2:33:45.560]  But let's continue to expose what's happening, where you see things going and then, as I said, solutions, Bev Harris.
[2:33:45.560 --> 2:33:53.560]  Yeah. Well, every election that we've looked at, we've found, let me put it this way, the best scenario.
[2:33:53.560 --> 2:34:06.560]  The best scenario we find is that we have to disclaim any, actually we have to disclaim any opinion on the results because there's not enough information and it's not even gettable to find it.
[2:34:06.560 --> 2:34:14.560]  And in many situations where we go in, we see actual fraud, they still do it clumsily.
[2:34:14.560 --> 2:34:25.560]  But if we don't get control of this situation, it's going to be like inoculating it so that it gets more and more resistant to citizen oversight where they'll get better at it and they'll be more skillful.
[2:34:25.560 --> 2:34:43.560]  You know, we still see things where they have gigantic typos in the wrong date on the memory tape, pull tapes that they rigged. You know, there's a tape that they had in Volusia County in 2004 where they accidentally did a typo while they were rigging the tape and they dated it 16,000 years in the future.
[2:34:43.560 --> 2:34:47.560]  You know, and you still see a lot of that now where it's just so clumsy, you can't believe it.
[2:34:47.560 --> 2:35:00.560]  But, trust me, they're going to get better at it and they're going to get more skilled and so we have to ultimately take back control of the whole process or it's just going to be harder to catch.
[2:35:00.560 --> 2:35:05.560]  Like any criminal, you know, they learn from their mistakes.
[2:35:05.560 --> 2:35:19.560]  In New Mexico, I was mentioning earlier, with the voter list, they simply handed out the wrong voter list, voter list missing lots of names, and then afterwards said, oops, so you got to watch this.
[2:35:19.560 --> 2:35:22.560]  And they still certify elections after they admit their frauds.
[2:35:22.560 --> 2:35:25.560]  Right. Oh, oh, oh, get this. You're going to love this.
[2:35:25.560 --> 2:35:35.560]  Palm Beach County, again, it has problems every election. They lost 3,500 ballots. Now, the machines didn't count.
[2:35:35.560 --> 2:35:41.560]  First of all, they had a recount where these two candidates were separated in the primary last month by just 16 votes.
[2:35:41.560 --> 2:35:46.560]  Every time they put the ballots through the machines, which were the Cuyah machines, they counted differently.
[2:35:46.560 --> 2:35:50.560]  But not only that, they lost 3,500 ballots.
[2:35:50.560 --> 2:36:02.560]  And so what happens is the people sign off on certifying the election and because they couldn't figure out what the numbers are, the canvassing board signed off on blank pieces of paper.
[2:36:02.560 --> 2:36:08.560]  I mean, these people need to go to jail. You know, I mean, we would not get away with it.
[2:36:08.560 --> 2:36:16.560]  Imagine sending in a form to the IRS and just leaving it blank and signing it and saying, well, I didn't know the numbers, so I signed it.
[2:36:16.560 --> 2:36:20.560]  It's ridiculous what we put up with.
[2:36:20.560 --> 2:36:26.560]  But yeah, pretty much everywhere you look, you find these, you find either one or two things.
[2:36:26.560 --> 2:36:35.560]  You find things that you certainly can't explain and they're completely not acceptable or you can't even find the information because it's hidden.
[2:36:35.560 --> 2:36:40.560]  So the question you asked is, what can we do about it?
[2:36:40.560 --> 2:36:46.560]  Well, we have a system that we're going to be putting out this election.
[2:36:46.560 --> 2:36:51.560]  We put the first video out this weekend, this last weekend. It's called Protect the Count.
[2:36:51.560 --> 2:37:07.560]  And it is the first effort to really get citizens in the field on election night looking for things because one of the things that kind of gets my go is people call me up and they say, you need to research this and you need to investigate that.
[2:37:07.560 --> 2:37:17.560]  And I'm thinking, you know what, America, if you don't get out there and do the same kinds of things that I'm doing, I'll help you.
[2:37:17.560 --> 2:37:22.560]  I'll mentor you, but don't think I'm going to do this for you because I'm not.
[2:37:22.560 --> 2:37:27.560]  We're not going to get our country back unless we go take it back, all of us.
[2:37:27.560 --> 2:37:38.560]  Here's an example. You had to put out thousands of Freedom Information Act requests yourself for the 2004 election.
[2:37:38.560 --> 2:37:42.560]  You did it in one night, stayed up until five in the morning.
[2:37:42.560 --> 2:37:45.560]  Entering those yourself, it's covered in the film.
[2:37:45.560 --> 2:37:58.560]  And then you would get back a four or five days signed after the election, what was clearly as an auditor, a fake computer tape receipt.
[2:37:58.560 --> 2:38:06.560]  And then you go from California all the way to Florida and other parts of the country, you walk in, you say, hey, this is a fake computer printout.
[2:38:06.560 --> 2:38:12.560]  And it's got signatures after the fact that violates federal and state law and they say, well, it's no big deal.
[2:38:12.560 --> 2:38:21.560]  Then you go, I want to go over there to the warehouse where it's held and you catch them with the trash running out suspiciously weeks later.
[2:38:21.560 --> 2:38:24.560]  You know, right when you pull up to throw it away, you grab it away.
[2:38:24.560 --> 2:38:28.560]  They say no, the bag rips open and it's all the real tapes.
[2:38:28.560 --> 2:38:32.560]  I mean, this is like a cartoon who'd done it where you're and they didn't match.
[2:38:32.560 --> 2:38:36.560]  I mean, well, I mean, that's the next thing is that the tapes were different.
[2:38:36.560 --> 2:38:42.560]  But that's what I was about to say the date, but they did. They had different votes on them. That's what I was about.
[2:38:42.560 --> 2:38:49.560]  That's what I was about to say is that not only are they giving you a fake tape, you go and catch them and basically tackle them like in a movie.
[2:38:49.560 --> 2:38:52.560]  Then there are the real tapes showing it was an election fraud.
[2:38:52.560 --> 2:38:56.560]  I mean, I mean, it is and then they look so guilty when you're back at the central area.
[2:38:56.560 --> 2:38:58.560]  It's just incredible.
[2:38:58.560 --> 2:38:59.560]  Sorry, go ahead.
[2:38:59.560 --> 2:39:09.560]  And the thing is, if we get out in the field and if we what I'm telling people to do this election is if you're already a credential observer or you're already a poll worker,
[2:39:09.560 --> 2:39:19.560]  take another 30 minutes, take a snapshot or a camera and get evidence of what that poll tape result was before it ever left the polling place.
[2:39:19.560 --> 2:39:21.560]  That's going to be helpful.
[2:39:21.560 --> 2:39:30.560]  Now, if you are not a credential observer and not a poll worker, these things are supposed to be put on the building for a few hours.
[2:39:30.560 --> 2:39:34.560]  They're supposed to stay there for 24 hours, but they usually stay there for six or eight hours.
[2:39:34.560 --> 2:39:38.560]  So even after the polls close, get your video camera, spend 90 minutes.
[2:39:38.560 --> 2:39:45.560]  Don't just sit in front of the TV and think, well, Bev Harris is going to get it because I'm telling you right now, I'm not going to get it.
[2:39:45.560 --> 2:39:47.560]  I can't be in all those places at once.
[2:39:47.560 --> 2:39:53.560]  And we're not going to pull this over the tipping point with just Bev Harris.
[2:39:53.560 --> 2:40:00.560]  We've got to have citizens out there and just tell yourself, you know, instead of sitting in front of the TV, I'm going to spend 90 minutes out in the field.
[2:40:00.560 --> 2:40:05.560]  I'm going to grab my camera and I'm going to get copies of what these things were before the poll.
[2:40:05.560 --> 2:40:12.560]  Hey, Bev, I've had crazy listeners sue me twice saying I didn't sue this government person or I didn't do this investigation.
[2:40:12.560 --> 2:40:17.560]  I don't just have them calling me up and emailing me saying I better do this and that.
[2:40:17.560 --> 2:40:23.560]  I have them, and of course it gets thrown out, suing me because I'm not doing enough.
[2:40:23.560 --> 2:40:29.560]  Oh, yeah. I mean, I flip it right back because I have people call me all the time telling me what I should do.
[2:40:29.560 --> 2:40:35.560]  And I'm thinking, okay, I gave up my entire life savings in my last six years and worked 100 hours a week.
[2:40:35.560 --> 2:40:36.560]  What are you doing, guys?
[2:40:36.560 --> 2:40:44.560]  I think that's one of the things we've suffered from in this country is the citizens have an inferiority complex.
[2:40:44.560 --> 2:40:46.560]  We can do this.
[2:40:46.560 --> 2:40:55.560]  The most brilliant things that are being done are being done by fishermen, pottery teachers, real estate agents, construction workers.
[2:40:55.560 --> 2:40:58.560]  It's not experts that are really making a difference right now.
[2:40:58.560 --> 2:40:59.560]  Bev, here's an example.
[2:40:59.560 --> 2:41:07.560]  If you just go park behind the election offices or you follow the vans, you're going to see them pull off in fields and put them in the backs of black Cadillacs.
[2:41:07.560 --> 2:41:09.560]  You're going to see, I mean, this happens.
[2:41:09.560 --> 2:41:11.560]  Which is why you need your video camera.
[2:41:11.560 --> 2:41:12.560]  People don't want to do that.
[2:41:12.560 --> 2:41:13.560]  Folks, government is so corrupt.
[2:41:13.560 --> 2:41:15.560]  You've got to have that video.
[2:41:15.560 --> 2:41:20.560]  Government is so corrupt that nine times out of ten, if you just go watch them any time.
[2:41:20.560 --> 2:41:24.560]  I mean, every time I walk in the Capitol, there's payoffs in front of me with cash.
[2:41:24.560 --> 2:41:29.560]  I mean, the criminals have taken over, so they're operating like it's nothing.
[2:41:29.560 --> 2:41:31.560]  And it helps to get video.
[2:41:31.560 --> 2:41:44.560]  It's the videotape taken by an Austin citizen, Kathleen Wynn, in Ohio, in that tape, Hacking Democracy, that resulted in two women being sentenced to a year and a half in prison.
[2:41:44.560 --> 2:41:46.560]  The videotape, that's all it was.
[2:41:46.560 --> 2:41:49.560]  Without the video, no conviction.
[2:41:49.560 --> 2:41:52.560]  So the videotape, I cannot stress enough.
[2:41:52.560 --> 2:41:54.560]  Tell folks what the women did.
[2:41:54.560 --> 2:41:55.560]  Tell folks what the women did.
[2:41:55.560 --> 2:42:01.560]  Well, Kathleen Wynn, she went up there and she was asking questions about this recount they did.
[2:42:01.560 --> 2:42:06.560]  And she asked how they chose the random poll of the 3% of the precincts.
[2:42:06.560 --> 2:42:08.560]  And they said, our random is our random.
[2:42:08.560 --> 2:42:10.560]  We always select it.
[2:42:10.560 --> 2:42:13.560]  Which, of course, is a violation of state law.
[2:42:13.560 --> 2:42:20.560]  Well, they selected it and they made sure that what they selected was specific areas that happened to match.
[2:42:20.560 --> 2:42:22.560]  As opposed to all the other areas.
[2:42:22.560 --> 2:42:26.560]  And then when those matched, they said, okay, no more recount, everything matched.
[2:42:26.560 --> 2:42:28.560]  So they rigged the recount.
[2:42:28.560 --> 2:42:30.560]  But she caught them on tape doing it.
[2:42:30.560 --> 2:42:36.560]  And that is what, eventually, two years later, led to them being sentenced to a year and a half in prison.
[2:42:36.560 --> 2:42:43.560]  Well, by the way, these county Clarkson people, these are, most of them are hardcore operatives and are in with a good old boy club.
[2:42:43.560 --> 2:42:47.560]  And the public's like, well, it's such a nice old lady.
[2:42:47.560 --> 2:42:49.560]  I mean, ladies and gentlemen.
[2:42:49.560 --> 2:42:51.560]  Thank you.
[2:42:51.560 --> 2:42:52.560]  That's right.
[2:42:52.560 --> 2:42:53.560]  I hear that all the time.
[2:42:53.560 --> 2:42:58.560]  Two people say, well, my election official is really nice and I trust her.
[2:42:58.560 --> 2:43:00.560]  And I'm like, you are missing the vote.
[2:43:00.560 --> 2:43:02.560]  It isn't about I trust her or I don't.
[2:43:02.560 --> 2:43:05.560]  Can you see what she's doing?
[2:43:05.560 --> 2:43:06.560]  Period.
[2:43:06.560 --> 2:43:11.560]  If you can't see, we need to take a page from what financial auditors say.
[2:43:11.560 --> 2:43:18.560]  When financial auditors can't see the transactions, they don't say, but I think the person is nice.
[2:43:18.560 --> 2:43:19.560]  You never read that in an audit.
[2:43:19.560 --> 2:43:24.560]  What they say is there's no basis for confidence in the results.
[2:43:24.560 --> 2:43:28.560]  There's no, we just claim any opinion on the accuracy.
[2:43:28.560 --> 2:43:40.560]  In other words, if you can't see it, then you can, then what the only proper response is to disclaim any opinion on the accuracy and to declare that there's no basis for confidence.
[2:43:40.560 --> 2:43:42.560]  Bev Harris is our guest.
[2:43:42.560 --> 2:43:49.560]  We have take Vicki Carp and others here in Austin, Texas. She heard my show, I guess, four or five years ago.
[2:43:49.560 --> 2:43:50.560]  Yeah.
[2:43:50.560 --> 2:43:57.560]  Or longer and we were covering election fraud and she didn't really believe it, but she went and checked into it and found out that it was true.
[2:43:57.560 --> 2:44:01.560]  And now she's had a big effect and there's so many other people out there taking action.
[2:44:01.560 --> 2:44:05.560]  What are some other things people can do in this election?
[2:44:05.560 --> 2:44:11.560]  Well, here's something, especially if you're a credentialed observer and you can get credentials and it doesn't have to be a major party.
[2:44:11.560 --> 2:44:16.560]  It can be any of the parties that are on the ballot, so Libertarian, Green, any of those.
[2:44:16.560 --> 2:44:18.560]  Check and see.
[2:44:18.560 --> 2:44:24.560]  Now, they seal up these ballot boxes and they seal the memory cards and the seals are supposed to have a number.
[2:44:24.560 --> 2:44:27.560]  They never match. They're never, they're broken. They're missing.
[2:44:27.560 --> 2:44:30.560]  There's only one reason for the seal to be broken and missing, folks.
[2:44:30.560 --> 2:44:33.560]  Just picture it. Don't worry about the memory card.
[2:44:33.560 --> 2:44:37.560]  Yeah, they have a seal on the memory card and the bag that holds the memory card and it's missing.
[2:44:37.560 --> 2:44:40.560]  Think of it like old fashioned ballot boxes.
[2:44:40.560 --> 2:44:46.560]  What does it mean if the ballot box comes in and the seal has been removed?
[2:44:46.560 --> 2:44:52.560]  There's not that many explanations for it other than somebody got into it.
[2:44:52.560 --> 2:45:00.560]  So one of the things that people can do is actually just go check and see whether the seals are intact and whether they match
[2:45:00.560 --> 2:45:04.560]  and whether they're broken and document it when they haven't been.
[2:45:04.560 --> 2:45:15.560]  Part of what we need to do now is gather this hard evidence in more locations so that we can throw this rotten system out.
[2:45:15.560 --> 2:45:18.560]  And you're right. You said one thing that was really important.
[2:45:18.560 --> 2:45:23.560]  What I see that I'm optimistic about that's different in 2008 than it was in 2004.
[2:45:23.560 --> 2:45:27.560]  In 2004, everybody was, nobody was listening to me.
[2:45:27.560 --> 2:45:33.560]  I was talking to all these highfalutin characters with the campaigns and so forth and they weren't listening at all.
[2:45:33.560 --> 2:45:38.560]  This year, people get it. There's something wrong with this system.
[2:45:38.560 --> 2:45:45.560]  And the New York Times, you can't get more mainstream than that, interviewed a member of the Election Assistance Commission.
[2:45:45.560 --> 2:45:47.560]  You can't get more government than that.
[2:45:47.560 --> 2:45:53.560]  And the Election Assistance Commission admitted we will be voting on machines that are defective.
[2:45:53.560 --> 2:45:59.560]  And the New York Times even wrote and it can't be fixed before the election.
[2:45:59.560 --> 2:46:03.560]  But by the way, they're spending it that they're defective.
[2:46:03.560 --> 2:46:11.560]  No, they're doing what they're meant to do, carried out, organized, secured, sequestered fraud.
[2:46:11.560 --> 2:46:16.560]  And for folks that think that this just started 10 years ago or 8 years ago in 2000,
[2:46:16.560 --> 2:46:22.560]  before, after the election, you would hear, well, wait a minute, this county really went for this person or this state really went for that person.
[2:46:22.560 --> 2:46:26.560]  But voter news services, this secretive group of top media people,
[2:46:26.560 --> 2:46:32.560]  they would just announce who had won and over and over again, it was fraud and then that was proven.
[2:46:32.560 --> 2:46:39.560]  And so because the public was exposing that, that made them move in with these military industrial complex front companies.
[2:46:39.560 --> 2:46:43.560]  That's who they are with young CIA guys with shaved heads guarding, you know, the facilities.
[2:46:43.560 --> 2:46:47.560]  And that's, you know, who it is. I've talked to the calliers and their daughter and others and I've seen it myself.
[2:46:47.560 --> 2:46:50.560]  And so they tried to move in with something they could control easier.
[2:46:50.560 --> 2:46:58.560]  People think, well, it's just the touchscreen or the purely electronic that are built for somebody to hack in and change 5,000 machines in 60 seconds or whatever,
[2:46:58.560 --> 2:47:04.560]  as they're designed to do with no record. But then it's the, it's the bubble, you know, type, it's the scantron.
[2:47:04.560 --> 2:47:08.560]  Those are centrally tabulated. This has been going on a long time.
[2:47:08.560 --> 2:47:18.560]  And that's why you can have on every issue, the people, 80, 90% against both parties, you know, you can have 1000 calls to every call for the bailout.
[2:47:18.560 --> 2:47:24.560]  But still they pass it because the system and the politicians and I've talked to high level ones, they know.
[2:47:24.560 --> 2:47:26.560]  And they know they'll know.
[2:47:26.560 --> 2:47:27.560]  Yeah, there's no consequences.
[2:47:27.560 --> 2:47:28.560]  Oh yeah, they know.
[2:47:28.560 --> 2:47:39.560]  Yeah, the people are not in control. I mean, we have to unfortunately get past our rosy and happy view of what we thought we were because we aren't.
[2:47:39.560 --> 2:47:47.560]  And then we have to do what Americans are so good at, which is roll up our sleeves and tackle this monster and make sure that we get control back.
[2:47:47.560 --> 2:47:53.560]  And you know what, people have told me, well, I think if I don't get my candidate in this election, then it's all over.
[2:47:53.560 --> 2:47:55.560]  It's like, no, you don't give up.
[2:47:55.560 --> 2:48:08.560]  It's not about what candidate gets in. We have to take back control or we will always be at the mercy of, you know, some magical mat, some candidate who comes and waves the magic wand.
[2:48:08.560 --> 2:48:10.560]  Is that really what we want? That is not freedom.
[2:48:10.560 --> 2:48:17.560]  No, it's about going the distance. And, you know, I've had the idea for more than a decade to have paper ballots.
[2:48:17.560 --> 2:48:28.560]  And the way you get that is you sign a petition to, you know, basically bring it to a vote at the city council at your level.
[2:48:28.560 --> 2:48:34.560]  And in there, you have it funded to have this special election be done with paper ballots.
[2:48:34.560 --> 2:48:40.560]  And so then it's funded and then you watch it and then everybody goes out and monitors for fraud and it'll be there.
[2:48:40.560 --> 2:48:46.560]  They don't want to give up control. You know, they're in there stealing as fast as they can, folks. Corruptions endemic. It's everywhere.
[2:48:46.560 --> 2:48:51.560]  I mean, I mean, this country is run by criminals from the top to the bottom and they're only bringing more of their crooks in.
[2:48:51.560 --> 2:48:56.560]  And they told Congress last week, don't vote for this martial law be declared. I had the congressman on.
[2:48:56.560 --> 2:48:58.560]  I mean, this is really happening.
[2:48:58.560 --> 2:49:06.560]  What do you think of the idea of having like a recall of a governor, county by county recall of the fraudulent machines?
[2:49:06.560 --> 2:49:13.560]  Oh, I think that's marvelous. And, you know, Sarasota County, Florida, the citizens did get it on the ballot and they won.
[2:49:13.560 --> 2:49:17.560]  And they have optical scans there now, which now they don't work either.
[2:49:17.560 --> 2:49:22.560]  But it was interesting because, oh my goodness, they were fought at every level, but they won.
[2:49:22.560 --> 2:49:31.560]  We can do this thing, but we first have to get the rosy colored glasses off and be able to have the courage to look.
[2:49:31.560 --> 2:49:34.560]  And that's why I want people out in the field on election night.
[2:49:34.560 --> 2:49:37.560]  And by the way, you will be told that you can't videotape.
[2:49:37.560 --> 2:49:46.560]  So what you do then is you videotape them telling you you can't videotape and you say, why are you hiding the information?
[2:49:46.560 --> 2:49:55.560]  And then you put it on YouTube and you show there, you know, anybody who tells you you can't get evidence of your own election needs to be exposed.
[2:49:55.560 --> 2:50:01.560]  Well, also, state and federal laws say that you can videotape and the press is supposed to have access to that.
[2:50:01.560 --> 2:50:05.560]  But bottom line here, final segment of that pair is coming up.
[2:50:05.560 --> 2:50:10.560]  They know that we know and we have to stop them.
[2:50:10.560 --> 2:50:13.560]  The government is illegitimate, period.
[2:50:13.560 --> 2:50:16.560]  It is completely run by foreign banks, period.
[2:50:16.560 --> 2:50:22.560]  Bev Harris, fraud investigator is our guest. She is the star of Hacking Democracy. Stay with us.
[2:50:22.560 --> 2:50:27.560]  Cameras are everywhere, above stoplights on toll booths and scanning the freeways,
[2:50:27.560 --> 2:50:32.560]  just waiting to snap a photo of your license plate only to slam you with ridiculous fines.
[2:50:32.560 --> 2:50:36.560]  In California, red light tickets are as high as $400.

[2:51:22.560 --> 2:51:29.560]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[2:51:29.560 --> 2:51:33.560]  The enemy struck America on September 11th. But who is the enemy?
[2:51:33.560 --> 2:51:38.560]  Bin Laden. This is his MO. We have to look to the Middle East. We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[2:51:38.560 --> 2:51:45.560]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[2:51:45.560 --> 2:51:52.560]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[2:51:52.560 --> 2:51:56.560]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[2:51:56.560 --> 2:52:02.560]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers' ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli Intelligence Network.
[2:52:02.560 --> 2:52:07.560]  Warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more. Fabled enemies.
[2:52:07.560 --> 2:52:15.560]  Get the DVD at infowars.com or see it in super high quality along with hundreds of other titles at prisonplanet.tv.
[2:52:15.560 --> 2:52:22.560]  Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists.

[2:53:29.560 --> 2:53:35.560]  Final segment with Bev Harris. We've had a lot of requests to re-air the interview with Governor Jesse Ventura last week.
[2:53:35.560 --> 2:53:44.560]  So we're going to re-air that in the fourth hour today. Look, a lot of people like cliches. They say Alex Jones is just negative.
[2:53:44.560 --> 2:53:55.560]  Why don't you be positive? Like I'm an Eastern Yogi and if I imagine something, oh, I decide the voting machines are good and my vote counts.
[2:53:55.560 --> 2:54:06.560]  That's delusion. We're actually very positive by admitting how bad things are. That's the only chance we've got about developing solutions to turn it around.
[2:54:06.560 --> 2:54:13.560]  And Bev, I guess you've gotten that over the years, too, though. You've been proven completely right. Then why don't you just be positive?
[2:54:13.560 --> 2:54:19.560]  Why don't you stop being anti-American? This is America. Everything's fine, even though it's been proven to be a fraud and triplicate.
[2:54:19.560 --> 2:54:26.560]  To keep my balance in this, I have a sense of humor and I recommend other people do, too.
[2:54:26.560 --> 2:54:34.560]  And people, they tell me not to laugh about the ridiculous stupidity, unbelievable that we see.
[2:54:34.560 --> 2:54:41.560]  But I feel like, you know what, if you can't laugh and you can't have the courage to look, you can never solve the problem.
[2:54:41.560 --> 2:54:50.560]  So it actually is just, you know, doctors in an emergency room sometimes laugh, too, because otherwise they lose their sense of balance.
[2:54:50.560 --> 2:54:56.560]  And by the way, one other thing, if folks cannot get out in the field, don't have a video camera.
[2:54:56.560 --> 2:55:02.560]  You know, we don't do this often, but I will tell you that black box voting won't be around for another four years.
[2:55:02.560 --> 2:55:11.560]  If we don't get financial support, we do need to, you know, bring in the donations. I'm confident we will. I have faith in that.
[2:55:11.560 --> 2:55:16.560]  But we do need to bring the donations in in order to pay for our travel and stuff.
[2:55:16.560 --> 2:55:20.560]  You know, we are not getting grants and we're not on the government payroll.
[2:55:20.560 --> 2:55:25.560]  I was about to say, for me to just make a film and fly four or five places with two or three people,
[2:55:25.560 --> 2:55:32.560]  I mean, we, I mean, this is even staying in, you know, hotels aren't that nice. It is bankrupting.
[2:55:32.560 --> 2:55:37.560]  And go to blackboxvoting.org, buy the books, buy the videos, you know, she's written books and put them out for free.
[2:55:37.560 --> 2:55:42.560]  We have this tendency to give it out for free. And because it's free, people don't even appreciate it.
[2:55:42.560 --> 2:55:48.560]  The point is, go there, donate. Bev Harris, I want to have you back up again in the next three weeks before the election.
[2:55:48.560 --> 2:55:55.560]  And I want to have you and everybody you recommend on, you know, the day after the election and in the weeks following that,
[2:55:55.560 --> 2:56:00.560]  as you're out in the field, as always, blackboxvoting.org. Thank you for coming on.
[2:56:00.560 --> 2:56:02.560]  Thank you very much, Alex.
[2:56:02.560 --> 2:56:07.560]  You bet. There she goes. Absolutely, folks, we need support. We need you to support our sponsors.
[2:56:07.560 --> 2:56:13.560]  We need you to support what we're doing because it's very expensive to do this radio show.
[2:56:13.560 --> 2:56:19.560]  It's very expensive for her and what she does. And absolutely, at the end of the day, I want to thank everybody that has supported Bev Harris.
[2:56:19.560 --> 2:56:25.560]  Okay. Speaking of sponsors, before we end this hour,
[2:56:25.560 --> 2:56:35.560]  NuVitality is a longstanding, wonderful vitamin and mineral company that has hundreds of good products that don't have any magic or miracle claims.
[2:56:35.560 --> 2:56:41.560]  They just are good stuff that's good for you, like their concentrated aloe vera with 29 other ingredients,
[2:56:41.560 --> 2:56:47.560]  aloe, colon and body cleans, flushes you all out. They're Superbeta Prostate for great prostate health.
[2:56:47.560 --> 2:56:54.560]  Go to NuVitality.com. That's NuVitality.com. If you forget the website address, there's a NuVitality link for Superbeta Prostate.
[2:56:54.560 --> 2:56:58.560]  You can see it up there near the top of InfoWars.com.
[2:56:58.560 --> 2:57:01.560]  Link through to NuVitality.com and check out their fine line of products.
[2:57:01.560 --> 2:57:07.560]  1-800-569-4056, stuff I believe in, 1-800-569-4056.
[2:57:07.560 --> 2:57:14.560]  And to call them, you can learn more about the hundreds of great products that they have, 1-800-569-4056,
[2:57:14.560 --> 2:57:19.560]  like the aloe's, body cleans, detoxifier or the Superbeta Prostate and many others.
[2:57:19.560 --> 2:57:23.560]  But those are two I can vouch for. So just telling you about that here.
[2:57:23.560 --> 2:57:27.560]  And yes, we busted our butts to make fabled enemies here with Jason Berners.
[2:57:27.560 --> 2:57:29.560]  That film exposes the fact that the government carried out the attacks.
[2:57:29.560 --> 2:57:31.560]  And if you call that negative, that's fine.
[2:57:31.560 --> 2:57:37.560]  You know, there's nothing I can do here other than tell you it's the facts and we're not safe.
[2:57:37.560 --> 2:57:40.560]  You can deny it all day, but they still carried out the attacks and they're still in power
[2:57:40.560 --> 2:57:46.560]  and they're going to carry out other crimes, like controlled financial implosions and other things,
[2:57:46.560 --> 2:57:48.560]  until we say no.
[2:57:48.560 --> 2:57:51.560]  You know, we told you the bailout would result in a stop market plunging
[2:57:51.560 --> 2:57:54.560]  and what's it been doing six, seven days straight.
[2:57:54.560 --> 2:57:57.560]  So please go to InfoWars.com and get the books and videos as well.
[2:57:57.560 --> 2:58:02.560]  All right, Governor Jesse Ventura, coming up. Stay with us.
[2:58:02.560 --> 2:58:06.560]  All right, that's it for PrisonPlanet.tv live.
[2:58:06.560 --> 2:58:12.560]  That's it for the PrisonPlanet.tv live feed for everybody out there watching.
[2:58:12.560 --> 2:58:16.560]  And the AC's been broken in the office and I just can't handle it.
[2:58:16.560 --> 2:58:19.560]  That's why I'm going off early, really, because I'm sweating in here.
[2:58:19.560 --> 2:58:23.560]  The equipment, this little room, it's like a bread box, bread oven in here.
[2:58:23.560 --> 2:58:26.560]  Plus people want to hear the Ventura thing. So here it is.
[2:58:26.560 --> 2:58:29.560]  God bless you all. I just want to thank John Harmon for the great job he's doing.
[2:58:29.560 --> 2:58:32.560]  This is it for the PrisonPlanet.tv stream. Take care.
[2:58:32.560 --> 2:58:37.560]  So does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[2:58:37.560 --> 2:58:42.560]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[2:58:46.560 --> 2:58:51.560]  Well, I'm really honored to have him with us for the next 60 minutes.
[2:58:51.560 --> 2:58:58.560]  He is former Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura, star of Hollywood alongside Arnold Schwarzenegger and many others.
[2:58:58.560 --> 2:59:00.560]  Two of my favorite movies, The Predator.
[2:59:00.560 --> 2:59:03.560]  And of course, The Running Man.
[2:59:03.560 --> 2:59:09.560]  And he is going to be with us again for the... with, sir.
[2:59:09.560 --> 2:59:17.560]  You know, I don't know, really. I guess the economy right now of which, you know, I'm paying...
[2:59:17.560 --> 2:59:24.560]  I think all of us are paying attention to it and trying, I guess, to figure out the dilemmas.
[2:59:24.560 --> 2:59:30.560]  Does a bailout worker doesn't it work? You know, you hear two sides to the story.
[2:59:30.560 --> 2:59:38.560]  And it certainly puts you in a predicament of picking the lesser of two evils, which means you're still picking evil.
[2:59:38.560 --> 2:59:43.560]  Well, let me throw in my two cents. They are terrorizing the public with the president and others saying,
[2:59:43.560 --> 2:59:50.560]  do this or there'll be a depression. Stuff like that from a Treasury Secretary and a president itself is firing a theater.
[2:59:50.560 --> 2:59:54.560]  And then if you read the bailout plan, it gives them total immunity.
[2:59:54.560 --> 2:59:57.560]  It allows them to basically be separate from the government with no oversight.
[2:59:57.560 --> 3:00:03.560]  So really, I think the 700 billion itself is a distraction compared to the new powers it gives the Treasury.
[3:00:03.560 --> 3:00:09.560]  Okay, well, you know, I'll trust you on that one. You know, I've been involved in other things the last week or so.
[3:00:09.560 --> 3:00:14.560]  If that's the case, then I fully do not support the bailout.
[3:00:14.560 --> 3:00:18.560]  Then I think it's ridiculous because this bailout, if it indeed happens,
[3:00:18.560 --> 3:00:24.560]  should come with so many rules and regulations that it's as sound as anything you can imagine
[3:00:24.560 --> 3:00:30.560]  because you can't be just taking money and handing people blank checks and telling them to fix it
[3:00:30.560 --> 3:00:36.560]  because that leaves virtually no accountability. It's kind of like how the war was run in Iraq.
[3:00:36.560 --> 3:00:42.560]  We've certainly seen a lot of that. We relied about the war. We relied too about so many other issues.
[3:00:42.560 --> 3:00:45.560]  And now the same crew. Let me take the conflict of interest.
[3:00:45.560 --> 3:00:54.560]  We have Henry Paulson, who still has a big stake in Goldman Sachs, directing tens of billions of dollars a week into his own company.
[3:00:54.560 --> 3:00:56.560]  I mean, how can he be doing that?
[3:00:56.560 --> 3:01:05.560]  Well, you know, I guess the best answer to that, Alex, is that we've forgotten that the Constitution today is a thing of the past.
[3:01:05.560 --> 3:01:12.560]  It's a document that doesn't exist anymore, which says there will be a separation of powers into three separate divisions.
[3:01:12.560 --> 3:01:21.560]  And as I look at the country today, I see that that isn't happening at all, you know, that we aren't a separation of power anymore.
[3:01:21.560 --> 3:01:31.560]  There seems to be no checks and balances whatsoever, which is what the forefathers tried to put in when they created the Constitution and the Bill of Rights,
[3:01:31.560 --> 3:01:43.560]  was that making it a system of checks and balances. And the problem is we've allowed people, I mean, I kind of laughed the other day when I heard Ralph Nader refer to George Bush as King George.
[3:01:43.560 --> 3:01:44.560]  And a socialist.
[3:01:44.560 --> 3:01:50.560]  I don't think Ralph is that far off with being able to say King George.
[3:01:50.560 --> 3:01:57.560]  Well, I agree. He's also pointed out that George Bush is more socialist than any president we've ever had. He's just giving it all to the elite.
[3:01:57.560 --> 3:02:12.560]  Right. So yeah, completely, you know, this is a bailout of wealthy and their argument is that these are the people that provide the job so that it will have a trickled out effect to all of us,
[3:02:12.560 --> 3:02:22.560]  which I have to assume will be some correctness to it. But again, how do you bail out the top and trust what they're going to do?
[3:02:22.560 --> 3:02:33.560]  You know, clearly, I find it very interesting that the very people that wanted to deregulate everything are the ones now leaving the socialist bailout.
[3:02:33.560 --> 3:02:41.560]  Absolutely. Governor Jesse Ventura will also talk about his book that's been on the New York Times bestseller list. Don't start a revolution without me.
[3:02:41.560 --> 3:02:48.560]  He is our guest for the rest of the hour after this quick break. Stay with us.
[3:02:48.560 --> 3:02:55.560]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[3:02:55.560 --> 3:02:59.560]  The enemy struck America on September 11th. But who is the enemy?
[3:02:59.560 --> 3:03:01.560]  Bin Laden. This is his MO.
[3:03:01.560 --> 3:03:04.560]  We have to look to the Middle East. We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[3:03:04.560 --> 3:03:12.560]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[3:03:12.560 --> 3:03:19.560]  Some US investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the US.

[3:06:08.560 --> 3:06:20.560]  A few days earlier, the Internationalists run the banking system, created these trillions in derivatives and tied it to our bank accounts R401Ks.
[3:06:20.560 --> 3:06:26.560]  Now they're saying, come in and invest in this, or basically it's all going to implode.
[3:06:26.560 --> 3:06:30.560]  These are the same interests that have all been moving offshore.
[3:06:30.560 --> 3:06:32.360]  moving offshore
[3:06:32.360 --> 3:06:36.440]  uh... and so just in closing any other thoughts on what's currently happening
[3:06:36.440 --> 3:06:39.680]  uh... with the bailout that uh... they are set to vote on the senate today
[3:06:39.680 --> 3:06:41.160]  governor
[3:06:41.160 --> 3:06:45.760]  well you know again we have to watch uh... i might not seem to tell all the
[3:06:45.760 --> 3:06:48.680]  american people is be vigilant man
[3:06:48.680 --> 3:06:51.880]  if you're not holding people's feet to the fire you're going to get back
[3:06:51.880 --> 3:06:55.320]  government and that's the problem in this country as a whole
[3:06:55.320 --> 3:06:57.000]  is that we fit back
[3:06:57.000 --> 3:07:00.920]  we live in our own little world and we don't pay attention to what's going on
[3:07:00.920 --> 3:07:02.200]  with the nation
[3:07:02.200 --> 3:07:04.520]  and then by the time it catches us
[3:07:04.520 --> 3:07:07.960]  we're basically caught with our pants down because we haven't paid attention at
[3:07:07.960 --> 3:07:08.960]  all
[3:07:08.960 --> 3:07:10.440]  you know maybe the group
[3:07:10.440 --> 3:07:13.880]  the group thing that will come out of this whole bailout issue
[3:07:13.880 --> 3:07:15.400]  is that it will finally
[3:07:15.400 --> 3:07:19.480]  get the american people to rise up to take their heads out of the sand and start
[3:07:19.480 --> 3:07:21.880]  paying attention alex
[3:07:21.880 --> 3:07:24.280]  yeah i don't want to go back to ancient history but i sure wish you were
[3:07:24.280 --> 3:07:27.040]  running for senate i don't blame you for not doing that because you got some
[3:07:27.040 --> 3:07:27.760]  other
[3:07:27.760 --> 3:07:30.720]  you know ways of getting the word out of the people staying in the fight we
[3:07:30.720 --> 3:07:31.840]  appreciate you
[3:07:31.840 --> 3:07:35.400]  not going back to mech uh... you know back to mexico to surf we know that's uh...
[3:07:35.400 --> 3:07:37.680]  probably quite beguiling but uh...
[3:07:37.680 --> 3:07:42.480]  let's get into uh... the fact that you are uh... doing a pilot and i know you're
[3:07:42.480 --> 3:07:46.260]  doing some other stuff but i don't know how how far you can go governor
[3:07:46.260 --> 3:07:50.840]  well i'm not doing actually i i've got uh... possibly two three pilots in the
[3:07:50.840 --> 3:07:52.180]  hopper but uh...
[3:07:52.180 --> 3:07:55.420]  i always like to tell people that i don't discuss them
[3:07:55.420 --> 3:07:59.640]  it in great detail until the first check clears the bank
[3:07:59.640 --> 3:08:03.040]  uh... that's that there's these are tv shows you know i am i'll be straight
[3:08:03.040 --> 3:08:06.680]  up front i am i do get paid when i do pilots
[3:08:06.680 --> 3:08:10.040]  uh... like anyone else and i don't know how to talk about job like
[3:08:10.040 --> 3:08:13.280]  that you know you got a little thing and so
[3:08:13.280 --> 3:08:14.120]  but uh...
[3:08:14.120 --> 3:08:17.600]  the pilot that we're doing now with the truth he did that work which is the
[3:08:17.600 --> 3:08:22.160]  formally court tv is going to deal with conspiracies and and uh...
[3:08:22.160 --> 3:08:23.280]  because they've been
[3:08:23.280 --> 3:08:27.400]  conspiracies of fascinating people going on twenty to twenty five years of
[3:08:27.400 --> 3:08:28.840]  better now you know
[3:08:28.840 --> 3:08:31.640]  starting off with the murder of john f kennedy and
[3:08:31.640 --> 3:08:35.200]  watching it evolve into everything else and now into the nine eleven
[3:08:35.200 --> 3:08:37.240]  conspiracies and uh...
[3:08:37.240 --> 3:08:40.160]  so i i think it's very intriguing stuff
[3:08:40.160 --> 3:08:42.680]  and even for people that don't believe
[3:08:42.680 --> 3:08:45.840]  or don't want to or or whatever it may be
[3:08:45.840 --> 3:08:49.720]  uh... it's still very compelling and interesting in its
[3:08:49.720 --> 3:08:53.920]  it and to me it's truly better than anything like tom clancy could write
[3:08:53.920 --> 3:08:55.960]  or anything like that because
[3:08:55.960 --> 3:08:58.280]  in many ways real life
[3:08:58.280 --> 3:09:02.280]  has more intriguing mystery than than what anyone could make up in their own
[3:09:02.280 --> 3:09:06.240]  minds and write it down as a fiction writer you know i have my own
[3:09:06.240 --> 3:09:07.720]  imagination so
[3:09:07.720 --> 3:09:12.000]  i don't really need to see somebody else's imagination or read about it
[3:09:12.000 --> 3:09:14.880]  but i do like i love history
[3:09:14.880 --> 3:09:17.360]  and it disturbs me greatly when
[3:09:17.360 --> 3:09:23.120]  uh... history is not recorded correctly or or history is misled because
[3:09:23.120 --> 3:09:27.080]  then generations from now people will never get a clear picture over what
[3:09:27.080 --> 3:09:28.480]  went on and so
[3:09:28.480 --> 3:09:33.120]  uh... you know delving into conspiracies i think it's just great
[3:09:33.120 --> 3:09:36.760]  intriguing great dramatic television and and uh...
[3:09:36.760 --> 3:09:40.720]  not only will it hopefully inform you hopefully will entertain you at the
[3:09:40.720 --> 3:09:42.600]  same time
[3:09:42.600 --> 3:09:46.240]  well i know that the networks are very interested in this because i've been
[3:09:46.240 --> 3:09:48.480]  approached many times of similar
[3:09:48.480 --> 3:09:52.520]  uh... similar ideas uh... by the networks of delving into the secret
[3:09:52.520 --> 3:09:54.360]  meetings infiltrating them
[3:09:54.360 --> 3:09:56.080]  uh... you
[3:09:56.080 --> 3:10:00.560]  basically exposing what's going on underneath uh... the rocks of government
[3:10:00.560 --> 3:10:02.840]  incorporations and i can't think of a
[3:10:02.840 --> 3:10:04.640]  think of a better person
[3:10:04.640 --> 3:10:07.040]  then uh... the uh...
[3:10:07.040 --> 3:10:09.680]  former underwater demolition in navy seal
[3:10:09.680 --> 3:10:12.040]  uh... individual and a former governor
[3:10:12.040 --> 3:10:16.200]  uh... out there uh... you know running around covering all of this now
[3:10:16.200 --> 3:10:20.440]  what let me know what's what's not keep me you know that there are people in
[3:10:20.440 --> 3:10:22.560]  the top of our multiple former mayor
[3:10:22.560 --> 3:10:24.200]  uh... i thought that
[3:10:24.200 --> 3:10:25.440]  absolutely
[3:10:25.440 --> 3:10:30.880]  and former radio talk show host and movie star and professional wrestler
[3:10:30.880 --> 3:10:31.640]  but
[3:10:31.640 --> 3:10:35.640]  well you know that's good that's going to be the entry to the show i as i said
[3:10:35.640 --> 3:10:37.400]  the press release
[3:10:37.400 --> 3:10:40.720]  you know i've been a god and i'm here i've been a governor now i'm gonna get a
[3:10:40.720 --> 3:10:44.680]  chance to be a detective and to be able to go speak out the truth and
[3:10:44.680 --> 3:10:45.920]  hopefully go
[3:10:45.920 --> 3:10:48.800]  question people and get some answers i guess
[3:10:48.800 --> 3:10:52.840]  you know if i could but what's going to happen in the show somewhat
[3:10:52.840 --> 3:10:56.440]  i guess for lack of any other better way to put it
[3:10:56.440 --> 3:11:00.280]  i'm going to become somewhat of a michael more of television i guess for
[3:11:00.280 --> 3:11:03.440]  this pilot
[3:11:03.440 --> 3:11:05.240]  but i don't have to report
[3:11:05.240 --> 3:11:10.560]  but but going out of order questions i'm going to go ask questions people
[3:11:10.560 --> 3:11:13.200]  i think my credibility precede me
[3:11:13.200 --> 3:11:18.280]  to where they can't take me lightly and i'm going to go simply ask questions and
[3:11:18.280 --> 3:11:22.120]  alex when i was going to underwater demolition training when we got the
[3:11:22.120 --> 3:11:27.080]  second phase which was land warfare and demolition when i went through
[3:11:27.080 --> 3:11:27.920]  uh...
[3:11:27.920 --> 3:11:31.920]  i had an instructor back then during the demolition phase that's been coming
[3:11:31.920 --> 3:11:33.100]  to ireland
[3:11:33.100 --> 3:11:36.560]  and this instructor was a chief warrant officer and
[3:11:36.560 --> 3:11:41.520]  he impressed to me very strongly with no reservations whatsoever
[3:11:41.520 --> 3:11:44.960]  that there is no such thing as a dumb question
[3:11:44.960 --> 3:11:48.080]  especially when you work with demolition
[3:11:48.080 --> 3:11:51.840]  because not only can you kill yourself you can kill your teammates along with
[3:11:51.840 --> 3:11:52.720]  you
[3:11:52.720 --> 3:11:57.720]  and so i've gone through life with that premise in mind that there is no dumb
[3:11:57.720 --> 3:11:58.640]  question
[3:11:58.640 --> 3:12:04.360]  a question certainly isn't done to someone if they don't understand it
[3:12:04.360 --> 3:12:08.320]  that's dumb to them well that's what i've seen a man straight away
[3:12:08.320 --> 3:12:12.200]  not yet well that's the way that i've gone through life and that's what the
[3:12:12.200 --> 3:12:14.840]  essence of this tv show is going to be
[3:12:14.840 --> 3:12:19.280]  simply that there is no dumb question and every question deserves a
[3:12:19.280 --> 3:12:24.520]  honest answer to it and so i'm going to be out about asking some
[3:12:24.520 --> 3:12:28.560]  you know solid questions but i certainly don't consider dumb and i don't think
[3:12:28.560 --> 3:12:31.000]  most people in america would either
[3:12:31.000 --> 3:12:34.640]  and uh... we'll see what kind of answers we could get from people well that's
[3:12:34.640 --> 3:12:36.720]  what i was gonna say is that
[3:12:36.720 --> 3:12:40.680]  that's what quote conspiracy theory is is the mainstream media and the dominant
[3:12:40.680 --> 3:12:41.880]  corporate culture
[3:12:41.880 --> 3:12:43.440]  anytime you say
[3:12:43.440 --> 3:12:46.360]  hey i think this bailout might not be a good idea they've been calling that a
[3:12:46.360 --> 3:12:47.760]  conspiracy theory
[3:12:47.760 --> 3:12:49.160]  or uh...
[3:12:49.160 --> 3:12:51.800]  you know i think that we need to question government more or have more
[3:12:51.800 --> 3:12:54.520]  checks and balances of there might be some corruption
[3:12:54.520 --> 3:12:58.200]  in government they call it a conspiracy theory so basically
[3:12:58.200 --> 3:13:01.800]  anybody questioning of the official paradigm
[3:13:01.800 --> 3:13:04.280]  is called a conspiracy theorist
[3:13:04.280 --> 3:13:07.760]  and we've seen the same thing in a going back to galileo when he said that
[3:13:07.760 --> 3:13:11.120]  uh... the earth that was orbiting the sun not the sun orbiting the earth
[3:13:11.120 --> 3:13:12.560]  you know they called him a
[3:13:12.560 --> 3:13:16.640]  a heretic and it isn't that's what's so suspicious about nine eleven is that
[3:13:16.640 --> 3:13:18.480]  you just ask questions
[3:13:18.480 --> 3:13:22.160]  and a stonewall an actual suspicious governor
[3:13:22.160 --> 3:13:23.800]  well and to me
[3:13:23.800 --> 3:13:27.480]  well that's the question we're going to try to pursue
[3:13:27.480 --> 3:13:30.720]  while it's what they've told us is true
[3:13:30.720 --> 3:13:34.800]  then you know that that old quote the truth will set you free
[3:13:34.800 --> 3:13:38.160]  well why would you have any fear of telling the truth
[3:13:38.160 --> 3:13:42.920]  alex i love to tell the story if i may when i was running for governor and at
[3:13:42.920 --> 3:13:46.240]  the time it was very much a yearly part where there were six or seven
[3:13:46.240 --> 3:13:50.000]  candidates and they were holding debates throughout the state of minnesota
[3:13:50.000 --> 3:13:53.760]  we're much different to texas where in texas you get one debate
[3:13:53.760 --> 3:13:57.520]  up in minnesota generally you might get twelve to thirteen of them
[3:13:57.520 --> 3:13:58.640]  and uh...
[3:13:58.640 --> 3:14:02.160]  uh... when we were at this one particular debate early on we were
[3:14:02.160 --> 3:14:06.920]  seated alphabetical so naturally i'm over on the far side
[3:14:06.920 --> 3:14:10.560]  i'll never forget all the other seven or eight other participants in the
[3:14:10.560 --> 3:14:13.560]  debate came in with stacks of papers and
[3:14:13.560 --> 3:14:16.040]  spin papers and all this stuff
[3:14:16.040 --> 3:14:18.120]  and i sat down with nothing
[3:14:18.120 --> 3:14:22.040]  and i remember there was a black woman a civilian sitting to my left and
[3:14:22.040 --> 3:14:23.320]  she quietly
[3:14:23.320 --> 3:14:26.960]  handed over to me a legal patent
[3:14:26.960 --> 3:14:30.720]  and i looked at her and i handed it back and i said no thanks
[3:14:30.720 --> 3:14:34.160]  and she said to me well don't you think you'll need that
[3:14:34.160 --> 3:14:36.200]  and i whispered back to her i said
[3:14:36.200 --> 3:14:40.120]  when you tell the truth you don't have to have a good memory
[3:14:40.120 --> 3:14:44.360]  and she looked at me and smiled and nodded she fully understood what i just
[3:14:44.360 --> 3:14:45.600]  said to her
[3:14:45.600 --> 3:14:49.560]  so in these debates i didn't need all that stuff because in essence
[3:14:49.560 --> 3:14:51.960]  every question i was going to be asked
[3:14:51.960 --> 3:14:54.160]  i would simply tell the truth
[3:14:54.160 --> 3:14:58.000]  and if you do that you don't need a good memory
[3:14:58.000 --> 3:14:58.920]  and so
[3:14:58.920 --> 3:15:01.800]  that's what we're taking forward here and people who
[3:15:01.800 --> 3:15:02.480]  who will
[3:15:02.480 --> 3:15:04.280]  don't want nine eleven
[3:15:04.280 --> 3:15:05.640]  well why
[3:15:05.640 --> 3:15:07.880]  if what you're saying is true
[3:15:07.880 --> 3:15:10.440]  and simply tell the truth and let the chips
[3:15:10.440 --> 3:15:12.160]  forward they may
[3:15:12.160 --> 3:15:14.640]  well governor i mean take the newness report
[3:15:14.640 --> 3:15:16.800]  they have now
[3:15:16.800 --> 3:15:20.320]  uh... retracted their previous five reasons building seven fell at forty
[3:15:20.320 --> 3:15:22.440]  seven story structure for those that don't know that was
[3:15:22.440 --> 3:15:23.640]  hit by nothing
[3:15:23.640 --> 3:15:24.840]  uh... that day
[3:15:24.840 --> 3:15:29.120]  and uh... they've retracted that it was bad building construction they have
[3:15:29.120 --> 3:15:33.720]  uh... retracted that a fuel tank blew up and did it they have retracted that
[3:15:33.720 --> 3:15:35.320]  the north tower fell
[3:15:35.320 --> 3:15:38.760]  and gouged out twenty five percent of the south face of building seven
[3:15:38.760 --> 3:15:41.520]  and now they're saying a new phenomenon this is like
[3:15:41.520 --> 3:15:45.520]  seeing a leprechaun your backyards a new phenomenon never before seen
[3:15:45.520 --> 3:15:47.760]  thermal expansion did this
[3:15:47.760 --> 3:15:49.960]  with twelve hundred fifteen hundred degrees
[3:15:49.960 --> 3:15:54.040]  uh... cool fires made it symmetrically fall so
[3:15:54.040 --> 3:15:57.160]  uh... they're just counting on the public not looking at the evidence and i'm
[3:15:57.160 --> 3:16:00.440]  here to tell everybody but i don't want your take on this the the the newness
[3:16:00.440 --> 3:16:01.320]  report
[3:16:01.320 --> 3:16:05.840]  has completely and totally backfired on them
[3:16:05.840 --> 3:16:09.840]  well the last report i thought correct me if i'm wrong
[3:16:09.840 --> 3:16:13.960]  the last report i saw from them on building seven stated that
[3:16:13.960 --> 3:16:18.240]  uh... date they said that that that the fuel in the building the diesel was not
[3:16:18.240 --> 3:16:19.720]  responsible
[3:16:19.720 --> 3:16:22.720]  they said the fire that destroyed the building
[3:16:22.720 --> 3:16:27.800]  was uh... basically furniture and papers burning yes and then they say
[3:16:27.800 --> 3:16:31.920]  it's never happened before so that was the final line on the report that i saw
[3:16:31.920 --> 3:16:35.360]  and alex i looked at it and started laughing
[3:16:35.360 --> 3:16:39.840]  i thought wait how can they possibly they're telling me that papers and
[3:16:39.840 --> 3:16:41.160]  furniture
[3:16:41.160 --> 3:16:45.200]  could cause a steel-structured girdered building
[3:16:45.200 --> 3:16:50.560]  to uniformly collapse in seven seconds alex if that's the case
[3:16:50.560 --> 3:16:53.480]  then what is being done because clearly
[3:16:53.480 --> 3:16:58.240]  in that era of time when that building was built there were probably hundreds
[3:16:58.240 --> 3:17:01.520]  of others built throughout our country in the world
[3:17:01.520 --> 3:17:05.680]  shouldn't there be steps taken to ensure public safety
[3:17:05.680 --> 3:17:10.120]  if merely a fire with with furnishings and paper
[3:17:10.120 --> 3:17:16.240]  can cause the total collapse of the forty nine-story skyscraper what is being
[3:17:16.240 --> 3:17:17.280]  done about that
[3:17:17.280 --> 3:17:19.200]  well let me tell you uh...
[3:17:19.200 --> 3:17:22.960]  federal agencies then put out new guidelines the last month telling them
[3:17:22.960 --> 3:17:27.160]  to uh... to build buildings differently and major engineering firms
[3:17:27.160 --> 3:17:30.880]  uh... and and groups are now suing the federal government saying this isn't
[3:17:30.880 --> 3:17:31.640]  true
[3:17:31.640 --> 3:17:33.120]  this isn't reality
[3:17:33.120 --> 3:17:36.840]  and they're saying if this is the case that a big lighter
[3:17:36.840 --> 3:17:41.400]  would be able to burn down a building and we don't need control demolition
[3:17:41.400 --> 3:17:43.200]  companies anymore
[3:17:43.200 --> 3:17:46.520]  well and that's the truth i i said that the day one

[3:22:05.600 --> 3:22:10.440]  well the part i took home from that more than anything is also the attitude i'm
[3:22:10.440 --> 3:22:15.400]  going to bring to this show so that all your listeners will be clear on this
[3:22:15.400 --> 3:22:16.880]  there's a scene in there
[3:22:16.880 --> 3:22:21.800]  where denzel washington turns and says this word he says
[3:22:21.800 --> 3:22:24.960]  explain it to me like i'm a six-year-old
[3:22:24.960 --> 3:22:27.840]  do you remember that from the film yes
[3:22:27.840 --> 3:22:32.080]  he makes that statement explain this to me like i'm a six-year-old
[3:22:32.080 --> 3:22:37.080]  well that's the aspect i'm taking forward on this explain it to me like i'm a
[3:22:37.080 --> 3:22:38.480]  six-year-old
[3:22:38.480 --> 3:22:42.680]  so that we will all be able to hopefully clearly understand what these people are
[3:22:42.680 --> 3:22:44.200]  talking about because
[3:22:44.200 --> 3:22:46.120]  i think for the most part
[3:22:46.120 --> 3:22:51.000]  most of us feel that if it were explained to a six-year-old we would be able
[3:22:51.000 --> 3:22:52.280]  to grasp it
[3:22:52.280 --> 3:22:56.120]  well i want to get more in a nine eleven let's talk about uh... you told me that
[3:22:56.120 --> 3:23:00.560]  it was great job meeting karen uh... johnson uh... out in
[3:23:00.560 --> 3:23:03.200]  phoenix uh... when you were there visiting when you went to the nine
[3:23:03.200 --> 3:23:03.960]  eleven
[3:23:03.960 --> 3:23:08.200]  truth event and spoke there and i love the video of the media trying to attack
[3:23:08.200 --> 3:23:11.800]  you and you throw it right back at them and say you explain it to me
[3:23:11.800 --> 3:23:13.360]  because the official story
[3:23:13.360 --> 3:23:15.560]  doesn't answer any of the real questions
[3:23:15.560 --> 3:23:19.520]  and even the nine eleven commission says they weren't allowed to even do their
[3:23:19.520 --> 3:23:24.080]  job so i recap what your experience was like really getting in with both feet
[3:23:24.080 --> 3:23:25.800]  in the nine eleven truth uh...
[3:23:25.800 --> 3:23:28.240]  uh... out in arizona
[3:23:28.240 --> 3:23:31.960]  well i'll tell you there's some dedicated people is the first thing i want to
[3:23:31.960 --> 3:23:35.440]  say you know uh... senator jock karen johnson
[3:23:35.440 --> 3:23:40.080]  to me she was tremendous courage because she's a current elected official
[3:23:40.080 --> 3:23:42.880]  who is making no bones about the fact that
[3:23:42.880 --> 3:23:46.800]  she feels that the nine eleven investigation was completely botched
[3:23:46.800 --> 3:23:47.480]  and that
[3:23:47.480 --> 3:23:50.960]  there certainly should be a second investigation done
[3:23:50.960 --> 3:23:52.200]  even though at this point
[3:23:52.200 --> 3:23:55.080]  time it would be exceptionally difficult because
[3:23:55.080 --> 3:23:57.040]  there as i stated earlier
[3:23:57.040 --> 3:23:59.960]  there's no evidence it's all been destroyed so
[3:23:59.960 --> 3:24:03.960]  nobody can go there and and get anything scientific
[3:24:03.960 --> 3:24:07.440]  you know it isn't made available to anybody but
[3:24:07.440 --> 3:24:09.240]  uh... the people out there
[3:24:09.240 --> 3:24:11.440]  super dedicated people and
[3:24:11.440 --> 3:24:15.400]  they're coming from all walks of life which is the thing that i'm really
[3:24:15.400 --> 3:24:18.600]  noticing and and that really makes me feel good
[3:24:18.600 --> 3:24:22.360]  not only do you have a uh... a strong group of young people
[3:24:22.360 --> 3:24:26.360]  whom you would expect you know i i grew up in the sixties so
[3:24:26.360 --> 3:24:30.360]  you know i know what it's like for young people to vote from the status quo
[3:24:30.360 --> 3:24:35.240]  i grew up in the generation that we used to say don't trust anyone over thirty
[3:24:35.240 --> 3:24:37.360]  you know i remember that famous quote
[3:24:37.360 --> 3:24:38.560]  and uh...
[3:24:38.560 --> 3:24:42.760]  uh... you know so you've naturally got young people that are heavily involved
[3:24:42.760 --> 3:24:43.680]  but then
[3:24:43.680 --> 3:24:47.480]  but there were also professional people out there who are involved people who
[3:24:47.480 --> 3:24:50.000]  you wouldn't expect to be involved
[3:24:50.000 --> 3:24:53.000]  who have taken time to study it a little bit
[3:24:53.000 --> 3:24:56.960]  and i think that's really the thing that needs to happen in this country
[3:24:56.960 --> 3:25:01.800]  we've got to break away i had a guy the other day just look at me and smile
[3:25:01.800 --> 3:25:05.560]  and he's at the golf club and he said i don't believe any of that conspiracy
[3:25:05.560 --> 3:25:06.600]  stuff
[3:25:06.600 --> 3:25:08.480]  and i looked at him and i said well
[3:25:08.480 --> 3:25:12.960]  what knowledge do you actually have what have you done to study it at all
[3:25:12.960 --> 3:25:16.400]  are you simply going on what the television is told you
[3:25:16.400 --> 3:25:18.400]  and what the government just told you
[3:25:18.400 --> 3:25:21.000]  and you just blindly accept that today
[3:25:21.000 --> 3:25:23.600]  and this guy was a vietnam veteran alex
[3:25:23.600 --> 3:25:27.040]  i would expect him to be a little bit more cynical
[3:25:27.040 --> 3:25:29.000]  you know in light of the fact that they've now
[3:25:29.000 --> 3:25:32.360]  revealed the golf of confidence that it never happened
[3:25:32.360 --> 3:25:35.680]  and you know in the fraudulent whole vietnam war
[3:25:35.680 --> 3:25:40.920]  well the u.s.a. how we wouldn't allow we wouldn't allow elections in vietnam
[3:25:40.920 --> 3:25:43.760]  because they do hope she didn't win them
[3:25:43.760 --> 3:25:45.840]  you know and things of that nature
[3:25:45.840 --> 3:25:46.680]  and so
[3:25:46.680 --> 3:25:49.520]  you know it and it just it irks me
[3:25:49.520 --> 3:25:51.680]  that the public is so
[3:25:51.680 --> 3:25:52.760]  uh...
[3:25:52.760 --> 3:25:57.400]  they don't want to debate because they don't want to believe anything else but
[3:25:57.400 --> 3:26:01.560]  that isn't the attitude to happen that's not going to do us any good because
[3:26:01.560 --> 3:26:04.800]  you know you can stick your whole in the head but it doesn't mean things are
[3:26:04.800 --> 3:26:06.920]  going to go away and they're going to be right
[3:26:06.920 --> 3:26:10.240]  the only way that happens is by people being involved
[3:26:10.240 --> 3:26:11.480]  paying attention
[3:26:11.480 --> 3:26:14.240]  and doing a little detective work on their own and
[3:26:14.240 --> 3:26:15.880]  and understanding that
[3:26:15.880 --> 3:26:18.840]  you cannot trust the mainstream media today
[3:26:18.840 --> 3:26:22.320]  and you cannot trust our government today
[3:26:22.320 --> 3:26:26.400]  absolutely and it's the denial that there could be corruption or there could
[3:26:26.400 --> 3:26:27.400]  be a problem
[3:26:27.400 --> 3:26:30.160]  that has allowed the corruption to take over history shows
[3:26:30.160 --> 3:26:34.160]  you're always going to have corrupt of groups and in criminal organizations
[3:26:34.160 --> 3:26:36.880]  an elite trying to take over and set up empires
[3:26:36.880 --> 3:26:38.960]  and abuse the average person's rights
[3:26:38.960 --> 3:26:40.760]  and and uh... liberty and property
[3:26:40.760 --> 3:26:42.680]  and so to deny
[3:26:42.680 --> 3:26:47.360]  that that if any of that exist in history or in this country
[3:26:47.360 --> 3:26:51.880]  uh... is the greatest folly and we're about to read the uh... whirlwind
[3:26:51.880 --> 3:26:53.320]  on that front
[3:26:53.320 --> 3:26:55.480]  uh... governor we're in a break in a moment

[3:26:58.680 --> 3:27:03.920]  the other thing i find so mind-boggling in this whole affair of nine eleven
[3:27:03.920 --> 3:27:05.480]  is the fact that we will
[3:27:05.480 --> 3:27:07.520]  so quickly believe
[3:27:07.520 --> 3:27:13.280]  that nineteen islamic radicals with box cutters could do what happened that day
[3:27:13.280 --> 3:27:15.680]  but we totally throw out that
[3:27:15.680 --> 3:27:20.440]  uh... on the christian side could never do something like that
[3:27:20.440 --> 3:27:23.120]  well that's a great point in fact let's keep talking about nine eleven i want to
[3:27:23.120 --> 3:27:24.400]  get into your book

[3:31:26.600 --> 3:31:30.240]  i'm really excited about it and willing else at the same time in a bunch of
[3:31:30.240 --> 3:31:34.320]  others that i'm not a liberty to talk about that are going to be at this event
[3:31:34.320 --> 3:31:38.000]  it just blows me away that this is actually happening but but so jessie
[3:31:38.000 --> 3:31:40.640]  didn't think i'm kidding him i've got his email i guess i could send it to him
[3:31:40.640 --> 3:31:45.600]  here is the trailer from the tv show they worked on this similarly but i think
[3:31:45.600 --> 3:31:48.280]  his is going to make it through i hope it does it's about a minute and a half
[3:31:48.280 --> 3:31:53.560]  long called american conspiracy here it is
[3:31:53.560 --> 3:31:57.560]  these are the stories you hear in whispered conversations
[3:31:57.560 --> 3:32:05.560]  we're both in skull and bone at the secret society it's so simple we can't talk about it
[3:32:05.560 --> 3:32:09.480]  i don't think it wouldn't take very long for that to happen dealing with people like this
[3:32:09.480 --> 3:32:13.320]  these are the stories that offer different explanations
[3:32:13.320 --> 3:32:17.800]  these mothers have been every monster you can imagine and i do this because i believe
[3:32:17.800 --> 3:32:24.600]  in this country they are the stories that must be told
[3:32:24.600 --> 3:32:29.160]  suspicion of our politicians is not new
[3:32:29.160 --> 3:32:32.360]  but the number of citizens who distrust the government today
[3:32:32.360 --> 3:32:36.280]  has reached an alarming new height in new york city
[3:32:36.280 --> 3:32:41.000]  nearly two-thirds of the population believes there is more to 9-11
[3:32:41.000 --> 3:32:45.480]  than has been told i believe the title was been lot and determined to attack
[3:32:45.480 --> 3:32:49.240]  inside the united states but where can viewers turn
[3:32:49.240 --> 3:32:56.360]  american conspiracy our nation's preeminent conspiracy expert
[3:32:56.360 --> 3:33:03.160]  radio host alex jones takes us beyond the stock stories of the mainstream media
[3:33:03.160 --> 3:33:07.160]  he asks the questions others won't consider have you been there for the
[3:33:07.160 --> 3:33:12.520]  ceremony with the uh the cremation here uh frankly that i don't think that's
[3:33:12.520 --> 3:33:16.840]  something i'm gonna talk to you about he explores the places others only talk
[3:33:16.840 --> 3:33:19.960]  about you're beginning to sink deeper in the rabbit hole
[3:33:19.960 --> 3:33:24.040]  he takes us through the doors others won't enter
[3:33:24.040 --> 3:33:28.440]  i can't begin to imagine what we're gonna discover
[3:33:35.480 --> 3:33:39.000]  in this first ever adrenaline fuel docudrama
[3:33:39.000 --> 3:33:42.680]  alex jones uncovers america's darkest secrets
[3:33:42.680 --> 3:33:45.560]  and you need to answer real questions instead of lying
[3:33:45.560 --> 3:33:50.600]  it is the x-files unscripted all the more frightening
[3:33:50.600 --> 3:33:56.440]  because it is real all right it goes on from there but uh
[3:33:56.440 --> 3:34:00.600]  governor ventura what do you think of that you got me hooked i'm ready to
[3:34:00.600 --> 3:34:04.040]  walk you know my wife last night i was
[3:34:04.040 --> 3:34:08.040]  telling her about this and she just got so excited because i frankly i think
[3:34:08.040 --> 3:34:10.360]  you're going to do 20 times better because you're going to be the
[3:34:10.360 --> 3:34:12.840]  producer and i know you don't want to give us
[3:34:12.840 --> 3:34:15.880]  i mean too many hints but but if it gets picked up
[3:34:15.880 --> 3:34:18.840]  i mean uh what what are some of the areas you're going to get into obviously
[3:34:18.840 --> 3:34:23.880]  jfk because isn't that what originally woke you up more than 30 years ago
[3:34:23.880 --> 3:34:28.520]  yeah it you know i there's there's certain aspects to the jfk murder that
[3:34:28.520 --> 3:34:33.160]  can still be looked at even today there's certain things that could be done
[3:34:33.160 --> 3:34:37.800]  which could shed a great deal of light as to what went on you know
[3:34:37.800 --> 3:34:40.920]  40 or 40 some odd years ago you know i have the tape
[3:34:40.920 --> 3:34:45.080]  of of of eHoward Hunt saying he ran the operation
[3:34:45.080 --> 3:34:48.120]  i have a video with you there well there's things of that nature then
[3:34:48.120 --> 3:34:51.720]  there's other stuff too out there that i'm not that i that i will get into but
[3:34:51.720 --> 3:34:55.640]  jfk uh you know it could it could lead us to
[3:34:55.640 --> 3:35:01.480]  to many many different things that that uh you know people have questions about
[3:35:01.480 --> 3:35:04.920]  and that uh there are conspiracies of you know there
[3:35:04.920 --> 3:35:09.000]  there's a lot of interesting things that deal around scientology and that
[3:35:09.000 --> 3:35:11.960]  religion hey how about how about you crash the
[3:35:11.960 --> 3:35:17.240]  scientology church or crash skull and bones
[3:35:17.240 --> 3:35:21.960]  oh my god in in in order to crash skull and bones i might need a whole field

[3:35:26.680 --> 3:35:32.280]  and give it off the ground yeah i want to be a sidekick what
[3:35:32.280 --> 3:35:35.400]  wait a minute i want to ask you something
[3:35:35.400 --> 3:35:40.120]  skull and bones now that's like the secret society at Yale University
[3:35:40.120 --> 3:35:44.440]  yeah it's a homoerotic uh germanic death cult
[3:35:44.440 --> 3:35:47.880]  where they well robert anero got it right in his uh
[3:35:47.880 --> 3:35:51.720]  big film uh the good shepherd and they do satanic rituals
[3:35:51.720 --> 3:35:54.760]  i've actually snuck into one of their meetings that they had separately in
[3:35:54.760 --> 3:35:58.760]  california the skull and bones that's what they
[3:35:58.760 --> 3:36:03.720]  do absolutely well isn't isn't george bush part of
[3:36:03.720 --> 3:36:08.200]  that yes it's very christian that's what i'm trying to figure

[3:36:20.360 --> 3:36:23.000]  them either for their sexual preference but why are they so hypocritical
[3:36:23.000 --> 3:36:26.760]  governor well i don't know nothing about that but it's
[3:36:26.760 --> 3:36:30.040]  certainly hypocritical if it's true i mean
[3:36:30.040 --> 3:36:33.800]  alec sometimes you go to places but even i don't know exist
[3:36:33.800 --> 3:36:36.920]  governor do you have a computer in front of you i love doing the google game

[3:36:51.960 --> 3:36:56.200]  who was in the white house press conferences and who was signed in over
[3:36:56.200 --> 3:36:59.720]  100 times past midnight at the white house
[3:36:59.720 --> 3:37:03.480]  you remember that i don't know a thing about any of that oh listen oh my god

[3:37:06.760 --> 3:37:10.600]  you better let me just stick to what i know about the focus on that if you
[3:37:10.600 --> 3:37:14.040]  get me off track with all this other stuff i won't know whether i'm coming
[3:37:14.040 --> 3:37:17.000]  or going i know well listen listen you know a lot
[3:37:17.000 --> 3:37:20.440]  about stuff i don't know about and and you're in a very powerful position
[3:37:20.440 --> 3:37:23.240]  and kind of like two years ago when i gave you terror storm
[3:37:23.240 --> 3:37:26.760]  i would love to just be an unofficial advisor and and just
[3:37:26.760 --> 3:37:30.760]  i mean i i could send you so much stuff that's admitted sir
[3:37:30.760 --> 3:37:35.240]  well we wrote like i said we're gonna do this first pilot and then we go with
[3:37:35.240 --> 3:37:39.800]  let's let's get this one on the air and once this one's on the air
[3:37:39.800 --> 3:37:43.560]  hopefully we will be brought into series and at that point we'll be looking
[3:37:43.560 --> 3:37:47.560]  for a lot more stuff to educate and entertain the people on
[3:37:47.560 --> 3:37:55.400]  well i publicly groveled to lord ventura lord ventura as i said alex we
[3:37:55.400 --> 3:37:58.920]  got to do it one step at a time no i know right now
[3:37:58.920 --> 3:38:02.440]  right now my focus is to do this pilot make it as good
[3:38:02.440 --> 3:38:08.280]  no entertaining uh to give people knowledge and to make people questions
[3:38:08.280 --> 3:38:13.080]  and things and give them enough facts to the to the ability to raise some
[3:38:13.080 --> 3:38:17.160]  questions and ask them and not be afraid to do it well you're supposed to be in a
[3:38:17.160 --> 3:38:21.320]  free country let's always remember that we're supposed to have the first
[3:38:21.320 --> 3:38:24.520]  amendment here where we can talk and then again
[3:38:24.520 --> 3:38:29.080]  and i know this has been said many times but people need to always remember
[3:38:29.080 --> 3:38:33.160]  the first amendment is to protect unpopular speech
[3:38:33.160 --> 3:38:37.400]  not popular because popular speech doesn't need protection
[3:38:37.400 --> 3:38:41.240]  well unpopular does you know what mark quayne said
[3:38:41.240 --> 3:38:44.520]  mark quayne said in the beginning a patriot is a scarce man hated and feared
[3:38:44.520 --> 3:38:48.120]  but in time when his cause succeeds the timon joined him because then it cost
[3:38:48.120 --> 3:38:51.480]  nothing to be a patriot and you really are a great patriot one of the biggest
[3:38:51.480 --> 3:38:55.240]  names to go public for 9 11 and it is becoming more and more mainstream
[3:38:55.240 --> 3:38:58.440]  thanks to you and and and and so many others what is it like
[3:38:58.440 --> 3:39:02.200]  to see the phenomenon of government sponsored terror becoming more and more
[3:39:02.200 --> 3:39:06.840]  accepted sir well you know we gotta wait to see you
[3:39:06.840 --> 3:39:11.000]  know let's let's see the chips fall and let's see the education take place but
[3:39:11.000 --> 3:39:15.560]  uh that's you know that's hopefully that's what this show will help to do
[3:39:15.560 --> 3:39:19.320]  and as i said uh you know i'm i'm i'm got my fingers
[3:39:19.320 --> 3:39:22.760]  crossed that they are that the courage will be there and that it'll get on the
[3:39:22.760 --> 3:39:26.200]  air and and uh you know that the two network i think
[3:39:26.200 --> 3:39:30.680]  has seen somebody told me in 90 million homes today or 100 million homes it's
[3:39:30.680 --> 3:39:34.280]  91 million you know that starts the ball rolling
[3:39:34.280 --> 3:39:39.000]  and it's one of the biggest uh cable system shows the networks out there
[3:39:39.000 --> 3:39:42.600]  and i tell you they're lucky to have you i'm just so excited about it i mean
[3:39:42.600 --> 3:39:46.280]  jesse ventura conspiracy investigations it doesn't get
[3:39:46.280 --> 3:39:50.920]  any better than that getting back into 9 11 there are so many facets to it but
[3:39:50.920 --> 3:39:53.240]  but some of the areas that they can't ignore
[3:39:53.240 --> 3:39:56.840]  is is the white house lying and saying we never heard of plans to fly planes in
[3:39:56.840 --> 3:39:58.920]  the buildings when there have been hundreds of government
[3:39:58.920 --> 3:40:03.160]  drills and plans and uh they'd even you know had operation bojinka and and
[3:40:03.160 --> 3:40:07.400]  other cases where things like this had developed uh we also have the war games
[3:40:07.400 --> 3:40:12.680]  that morning just like on sevens yeah but what gets me the most galaxies when i
[3:40:12.680 --> 3:40:17.720]  watched convalescer rights testify in state we had no idea they would take
[3:40:17.720 --> 3:40:21.080]  planes and use them as missiles in the buildings
[3:40:21.080 --> 3:40:24.760]  and then you find out that yes they did they they even had
[3:40:24.760 --> 3:40:28.920]  as you said practice things that do that that that had happened
[3:40:28.920 --> 3:40:31.960]  within the government and what would they do
[3:40:31.960 --> 3:40:36.520]  how can they sit back and look at us and say they were so naive
[3:40:36.520 --> 3:40:39.960]  that they didn't have any idea that this type of of
[3:40:39.960 --> 3:40:44.760]  situation could happen it helps my intelligence alex i'll tell you what
[3:40:44.760 --> 3:40:48.760]  insults my intelligence i'm in austin texas the main networks in
[3:40:48.760 --> 3:40:52.600]  burnsville minnesota and we have problems about three times a year
[3:40:52.600 --> 3:40:55.960]  and it's when we have somebody big like jesse ventura in fact the last time it
[3:40:55.960 --> 3:40:58.760]  happened was when he was on and you probably can't hear it governor but
[3:40:58.760 --> 3:41:02.280]  somebody's cutting into the line john i want to switch to the other isdn right
[3:41:02.280 --> 3:41:05.080]  now okay i don't know if you're hearing that
[3:41:05.080 --> 3:41:09.160]  crackling the okay it's switched yeah governor a lot of weird stuff going on
[3:41:09.160 --> 3:41:11.880]  here on our end but i'm sure it's just a coincidence that
[3:41:11.880 --> 3:41:17.320]  somebody cuts our our digital lines only when you're on the show
[3:41:17.320 --> 3:41:21.640]  well maybe it's coming from my end too because you know i wrote about that in
[3:41:21.640 --> 3:41:25.320]  my book you know the house that i lived in at the time i was governor it turned
[3:41:25.320 --> 3:41:28.360]  out that there's a pretty big strong evidence
[3:41:28.360 --> 3:41:32.040]  that my lines were kept there
[3:41:32.040 --> 3:41:35.720]  now governor after all alex let's remember
[3:41:35.720 --> 3:41:39.560]  our democrats gave the president the ability to do that again
[3:41:39.560 --> 3:41:42.760]  well well did you hear it when i was in you you probably didn't it was in the
[3:41:42.760 --> 3:41:47.240]  Denver Post when i was in Denver for the dnc i was going to meet
[3:41:47.240 --> 3:41:50.440]  uh with Cindy sheen and she was doing a big event with Ralph nader i was
[3:41:50.440 --> 3:41:53.640]  invited to that and i'm going to meet her and when i meet with her she goes
[3:41:53.640 --> 3:41:56.520]  guess what i just caught she goes in her room
[3:41:56.520 --> 3:41:59.320]  she's already been checked in she goes out and eats she goes in the doors
[3:41:59.320 --> 3:42:02.280]  cracked there's a guy in a suit over her phone
[3:42:02.280 --> 3:42:05.880]  putting a device in it he screws the top on and runs out of the room
[3:42:05.880 --> 3:42:09.400]  pastor i mean and then of course you talked
[3:42:09.400 --> 3:42:12.920]  about what happened at your house tell folks about that again
[3:42:12.920 --> 3:42:17.480]  well you know we our phone we have a system set up where as the governor in
[3:42:17.480 --> 3:42:20.520]  your private home they give you this red phone but
[3:42:20.520 --> 3:42:25.080]  even if it's knocked off the hook it will ring automatically the local police
[3:42:25.080 --> 3:42:28.040]  and you know who will come running which is a good idea
[3:42:28.040 --> 3:42:31.320]  you know you don't even have to speak into it if the if the phone is knocked
[3:42:31.320 --> 3:42:34.920]  off the hook that that sends a message right to the local
[3:42:34.920 --> 3:42:38.600]  police and they're they're coming and not but when they
[3:42:38.600 --> 3:42:43.480]  install that uh we always had weird clicking on my regular
[3:42:43.480 --> 3:42:47.160]  phones and it was so bad it became laughable where my in-laws would
[3:42:47.160 --> 3:42:51.240]  automatically state well i guess if you're out there we're talking again
[3:42:51.240 --> 3:42:55.480]  you know and that type of thing and then when i ended being governor
[3:42:55.480 --> 3:42:59.640]  uh we found a little transformer type thing out on my deck one day that a
[3:42:59.640 --> 3:43:02.680]  friend of mine said who used to do that for the phone company
[3:43:02.680 --> 3:43:06.360]  went ordered to said that that had something to do with uh
[3:43:06.360 --> 3:43:10.200]  you know a listening type device and then uh
[3:43:10.200 --> 3:43:15.560]  uh the guys who came out to then rewire my phones back up after the red phone
[3:43:15.560 --> 3:43:19.960]  was taken out and all this other stuff they came up just baffled they said
[3:43:19.960 --> 3:43:22.760]  we've never seen phone wiring like this in all the
[3:43:22.760 --> 3:43:28.200]  years we've worked on them so that's all i can go on alex is that it was a very
[3:43:28.200 --> 3:43:32.520]  strange situation to say the least by four years in office
[3:43:32.520 --> 3:43:35.960]  well you know you've you've told this story we never got into much detail
[3:43:35.960 --> 3:43:39.960]  here can you briefly get back into one of your first days at work you go to the
[3:43:39.960 --> 3:43:45.080]  capital and there's 23 cia people in your office but they won't tell you
[3:43:45.080 --> 3:43:50.280]  who they are they won't tell no that's that no they weren't in my office
[3:43:50.280 --> 3:43:55.160]  they were in the capital basement work and yeah they they and let's put it in
[3:43:55.160 --> 3:44:00.280]  the right thing they requested quote requested that i come down and
[3:44:00.280 --> 3:44:04.600]  interview with them you know i don't want to say they ordered me to because
[3:44:04.600 --> 3:44:10.120]  there was no one that said i had to but i being former military and you know
[3:44:10.120 --> 3:44:14.840]  due to the job i felt that i guess this is my obligation if the cia wants to
[3:44:14.840 --> 3:44:17.400]  talk to me and i'm the governor of the state of
[3:44:17.400 --> 3:44:20.600]  minnesota i certainly should talk to them
[3:44:20.600 --> 3:44:24.680]  so i went out and then that when it arrived i went down into the bowels of
[3:44:24.680 --> 3:44:29.640]  the capital into this closed room and i sat in a chair and they were in a big
[3:44:29.640 --> 3:44:34.280]  half moon circle around me and let me also say they were very
[3:44:34.280 --> 3:44:39.720]  professional they were very courteous they always addressed me as my
[3:44:39.720 --> 3:44:43.880]  title governor you know all the formalities were there
[3:44:43.880 --> 3:44:47.640]  i guess the scariest thing about it alex was this
[3:44:47.640 --> 3:44:51.240]  as i looked around the room at these 23 people
[3:44:51.240 --> 3:44:55.560]  i saw my neighbors and what i mean by that is
[3:44:55.560 --> 3:45:01.720]  you would never guess in your wildest dreams that these were cia operatives
[3:45:01.720 --> 3:45:07.800]  which is their job so obviously they recruit and they do it very well because
[3:45:07.800 --> 3:45:11.240]  some of the people i looked at would look like the old retired guy down the
[3:45:11.240 --> 3:45:15.320]  street that would sweep the step others were younger people
[3:45:15.320 --> 3:45:19.240]  others were professionals others were blue collar they
[3:45:19.240 --> 3:45:22.600]  they came from with an entire cross section
[3:45:22.600 --> 3:45:29.880]  of what you call america amazing and uh so and then of course i was a little
[3:45:29.880 --> 3:45:33.320]  belligerent being who i am and i i said before i have
[3:45:33.320 --> 3:45:37.240]  answering your questions i have a few for you and i
[3:45:37.240 --> 3:45:41.480]  one of them was i asked them why they were operational within the united states
[3:45:41.480 --> 3:45:45.400]  when uh when their orders are the and they're that they're not to be
[3:45:45.400 --> 3:45:48.920]  operational there's a federal law it's a felony
[3:45:48.920 --> 3:45:53.800]  right and well clearly that that law isn't enforced because
[3:45:53.800 --> 3:45:57.880]  they're entrenched in minnesota government and as i talk about in my
[3:45:57.880 --> 3:46:02.440]  book and what did they say to you well they they wouldn't really they avoided
[3:46:02.440 --> 3:46:06.520]  the question pretty much and you know i said your mission statement says you're
[3:46:06.520 --> 3:46:10.440]  not to be operational in the u.s what are you doing here
[3:46:10.440 --> 3:46:13.880]  you know and then i said i want to go around the room and i'd like for you
[3:46:13.880 --> 3:46:18.920]  to tell me your name and what you do well i got about half and half on both
[3:46:18.920 --> 3:46:22.600]  half would tell me their names i don't know if they were their real names or
[3:46:22.600 --> 3:46:27.560]  not the way of verifying that and half would say at all what they did
[3:46:27.560 --> 3:46:30.920]  if they did tell me what they did how would you know that was the truth
[3:46:30.920 --> 3:46:34.600]  you know how did you tell it it was much like when i went through
[3:46:34.600 --> 3:46:38.280]  sears school survival escape resistance in evasion when i was
[3:46:38.280 --> 3:46:41.720]  a frog man well when they interrogate you there
[3:46:41.720 --> 3:46:45.160]  my actual rate was storekeeper which is supply
[3:46:45.160 --> 3:46:49.880]  so i would tell them i'm a storekeeper i work in supply i hand out blankets and
[3:46:49.880 --> 3:46:54.120]  requisition parts although i was actually a navy seal
[3:46:54.120 --> 3:46:58.280]  never worked in supply at all but at those days you had to go up in rank with
[3:46:58.280 --> 3:47:01.960]  a regular navy rate and so i was a storekeeper
[3:47:01.960 --> 3:47:06.280]  and uh and maybe that's the way it was it is for these people too
[3:47:06.280 --> 3:47:09.160]  that they don't you know they can make up and not
[3:47:09.160 --> 3:47:12.520]  actually do what they tell you but didn't you say the meeting basically ended
[3:47:12.520 --> 3:47:17.240]  there because they wouldn't answer the questions oh no no not at all it didn't
[3:47:17.240 --> 3:47:20.760]  end there but i took their questions and amazingly
[3:47:20.760 --> 3:47:24.120]  all their questions dealt around how i got elected
[3:47:24.120 --> 3:47:27.960]  they wanted to understand how you came out of left field
[3:47:27.960 --> 3:47:32.920]  yep and that's their job and it's like when i went home that day and i called
[3:47:32.920 --> 3:47:37.320]  my friend big marsinko you know the creator seal team six and a 30 year
[3:47:37.320 --> 3:47:42.200]  navy seal and dick dealt with the cia a whole lot more than i ever did
[3:47:42.200 --> 3:47:46.680]  and uh and i you know i was only in the active duty four years dick was in
[3:47:46.680 --> 3:47:50.760]  there 30 something and uh so i called dick to ask him about it he
[3:47:50.760 --> 3:47:54.680]  started laughing and he said well i don't know exactly but i could throw a
[3:47:54.680 --> 3:47:58.920]  gas out and i said well your guess is going to be better than mine fire it
[3:47:58.920 --> 3:48:03.000]  he said they didn't see you coming and he said their job is to report trends
[3:48:03.000 --> 3:48:07.160]  they want to find out are there it's going to be six more of these independent
[3:48:07.160 --> 3:48:11.240]  governors that might win what's going on in the country because that's what their
[3:48:11.240 --> 3:48:16.200]  job is to do gather intelligence presented to the government so that the
[3:48:16.200 --> 3:48:19.560]  government can then make a determination and an educated
[3:48:19.560 --> 3:48:23.560]  movement on what they how they want to react to it well it's hard to believe
[3:48:23.560 --> 3:48:26.840]  yeah governor it's hard to believe that uh
[3:48:26.840 --> 3:48:30.600]  we are already right up to the final segment and i know you've got to go
