[00:00.000 --> 00:28.480]  The answer to 1984 is 1776, you're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[00:28.480 --> 00:32.160]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's Tuesday, the 15th day of November 2016.
[00:32.160 --> 00:36.240]  I'm your host Alex Jones, we're going to be here for the next four hours.
[00:36.240 --> 00:41.360]  We've got some big guests lined up as well today, but first, wow.
[00:41.360 --> 00:47.120]  There were not one, not two, but three different articles in the New York Times yesterday basically
[00:47.120 --> 00:52.840]  saying that I'm a conspiracy theorist and that globalism doesn't even exist.
[00:52.840 --> 00:58.000]  Not to mention world government or corporate world government, but that globalism is made
[00:58.000 --> 01:00.560]  up in my mind.
[01:00.560 --> 01:02.640]  And the New York Times said it, so it must be true.
[01:02.640 --> 01:07.880]  And Stephen Bannon is insane of the new head of the White House under Trump, the guy that
[01:07.880 --> 01:11.920]  plots the course, everybody else that I guess fears it.
[01:11.920 --> 01:16.400]  This is a new level of over-the-top brainwashing.
[01:16.400 --> 01:23.360]  Meanwhile, Business Insider, Obama on Trump's election, we have to guard against a rise in
[01:23.360 --> 01:33.760]  a crude sort of nationalism, so nationalism bad.
[01:33.760 --> 01:40.280]  Global government good, but doesn't exist, just like death panels on Obamacare.
[01:40.280 --> 01:44.280]  This is the mind control.
[01:44.280 --> 01:52.520]  So I thought today we'd go back and pull several dozen clips of world leaders calling globalism
[01:52.520 --> 01:59.520]  a move to world government and global governance, and we're going to have the definitions on
[01:59.520 --> 02:03.200]  screen for TV viewers, for radio listeners, we're going to read them on air, and we're
[02:03.200 --> 02:07.720]  going to have a little study time, kind of like Mr. Rogers' neighborhood for the New
[02:07.720 --> 02:10.000]  York Times and scores of other publications.
[02:10.000 --> 02:14.880]  But if you wanted to know the response to this route of globalism, they're going to
[02:14.880 --> 02:18.880]  announce we're all insane racists and it doesn't exist.
[02:18.880 --> 02:22.160]  So if you don't want foreign corporations ruling your life, you're a racist.
[02:22.160 --> 02:27.240]  Now here they are attacking Trump saying we're all racist, here it is.
[02:27.240 --> 02:32.240]  Nor he said had he heard about reports of racial slurs and personal threats against
[02:32.240 --> 02:38.840]  African Americans, Latinos, and gays by some of his supporters.
[02:38.840 --> 02:45.360]  I'm very surprised here that I hate to hear that, I mean I hate to hear it, I don't hear
[02:45.360 --> 02:51.880]  it, I saw one or two instances, but I think it's a very small amount, again I think it's
[02:51.880 --> 02:52.880]  the biggest.
[02:52.880 --> 02:53.880]  Do you want to say anything to those people?
[02:53.880 --> 02:58.560]  I would say don't do it, that's terrible, because I'm going to bring this country together.
[02:58.560 --> 03:01.240]  They're harassing Latinos, Muslims.
[03:01.240 --> 03:04.240]  I am so saddened.
[03:04.240 --> 03:09.240]  By the way, they put this video out, but I want to take it and re-release it, right
[03:09.240 --> 03:15.880]  here over Trump, showing the group of Mexican men beating up the white lady, this video
[03:15.880 --> 03:16.880]  is even hardcore enough.
[03:16.880 --> 03:23.880]  There will be, because people have to die to make a change in this world.
[03:23.880 --> 03:29.560]  Finally CNN says that's not a racial attack, he's attacked as he's white, he's a Trump
[03:29.560 --> 03:32.560]  supporter, but that's okay, because he doesn't exist.
[03:32.560 --> 03:38.160]  This is the media trying to create a racial attack.
[03:38.160 --> 03:42.160]  Since you voted for Donald Trump, you get your shit and get out.
[03:42.160 --> 03:46.160]  Uh-uh, the suitcase is packed by the dough.
[03:46.160 --> 03:57.160]  My love, this is even the most hardcore footage, we're going to put another one of these out
[03:57.160 --> 04:02.160]  that shows Mylon's up front, then Trump, then Dean Moore, and the guys did a great job
[04:02.160 --> 04:06.160]  on this one, it's nothing compared to all the racism and hatred and communism and idiocy
[04:06.160 --> 04:07.160]  and ignorance.
[04:07.160 --> 04:17.160]  This group comes up to me and she said, do you hate Mexicans, and I was like, no, and
[04:17.160 --> 04:24.160]  she said, you support Trump, you hate Mexicans.
[04:24.160 --> 04:25.160]  All this is pure tribalism.
[04:25.160 --> 04:26.160]  How is he racist?
[04:26.160 --> 04:27.160]  How?
[04:27.160 --> 04:28.160]  Yeah.
[04:28.160 --> 04:45.560]  Fucking Trump, he's totally mentally ill people, literal babies, stop it, he's gonna stop it
[04:45.560 --> 04:46.560]  by the way.
[04:46.560 --> 04:49.360]  All over the amount of states, you're at UT, but all over the country, they're handing
[04:49.360 --> 04:54.760]  out Play-Doh and coloring books and saying come in for counseling over the election to
[04:54.760 --> 04:59.760]  make the students even more mentally ill and deficient.
[04:59.760 --> 05:03.760]  Report, Hillary became physically violent after she realized she had lost the election.
[05:03.760 --> 05:07.760]  Clinton had to be briefly restrained after trying to attack her own campaign staff.
[05:07.760 --> 05:11.960]  Article of by Paul Joseph Watson, CNN reporter tells me Hillary became physically violent
[05:11.960 --> 05:16.160]  towards Robbie Mooc and John Podesta around midnight, had to be briefly restrained.
[05:16.160 --> 05:20.040]  It was Podesta who was sent out to talk to Hillary's dejected supporter shortly before
[05:20.040 --> 05:24.160]  Hillary called Donald Trump to concede with Clinton nowhere to be seen until the following
[05:24.160 --> 05:25.160]  day.
[05:25.160 --> 05:28.240]  When asked about rumors that Hillary was drunk on election night, Cancannon responded.
[05:28.240 --> 05:29.240]  She was.
[05:29.240 --> 05:30.240]  I posted about that too.
[05:30.240 --> 05:35.280]  She was in a psychotic drunken rage, according to my reporter friend, Doctor added sedatives
[05:35.280 --> 05:36.280]  to the mix.
[05:36.280 --> 05:39.800]  Cancannon then claimed that CNN blocked the reporter from publishing what would have been
[05:39.800 --> 05:41.480]  a bombshell story.
[05:41.480 --> 05:45.840]  The CNN reporter didn't fail to report it, his editors will not let him, CNN has banned
[05:45.840 --> 05:49.000]  all Hillary in the bunker stories he tweeted.
[05:49.000 --> 05:52.640]  Secret Service officials and other staff who work closely alongside Hillary have previously
[05:52.640 --> 05:56.320]  reported her problems with angry tantrums on numerous occasions.
[05:56.320 --> 05:59.840]  You can find more reports like this at infowars.com.
[05:59.840 --> 06:04.800]  You know, in the coming election, no matter who gets in, one of the biggest issues nobody's
[06:04.800 --> 06:09.760]  talking about on the debates or anywhere is the vulnerability of the power grid, the potential
[06:09.760 --> 06:12.000]  for power grid chaos.
[06:12.000 --> 06:18.600]  EMP, cyber warfare, onto mentioned dangerous weather, hurricanes, ice storms, all a very
[06:18.600 --> 06:20.200]  real threat to our grid.
[06:20.200 --> 06:23.480]  My friend's chaos is already here and it's going to get a lot worse.
[06:23.480 --> 06:28.080]  That's why I believe that all my listeners need to have a way to produce their own supply
[06:28.080 --> 06:29.480]  of backup electricity.
[06:29.480 --> 06:34.560]  Now I've got the perfect power solar generator system in my house, the solutions from science
[06:34.560 --> 06:35.560]  system.

[07:31.720 --> 07:32.720]  up.
[07:32.720 --> 07:35.880]  We've seen example after example of cable news networks attempting to deceive you.
[07:35.880 --> 07:39.760]  In short, the mainstream media is being covertly manipulated by well-financed political forces
[07:39.760 --> 07:44.040]  who are trying to sway public opinion in a natural direction that only serves establishment
[07:44.040 --> 07:45.040]  agendas.
[07:45.040 --> 07:49.920]  But Infowars Live is the solution to the controlled press that is rapidly losing influence.
[07:49.920 --> 07:55.160]  So download Infowars Live today at Infowars.com and learn what's really going on instead
[07:55.160 --> 08:10.760]  of being spoon-fed lies by the mainstream media.
[08:10.760 --> 08:16.840]  In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence,
[08:16.840 --> 08:30.440]  whether sought or unsought, by the military industrial complex.
[08:30.440 --> 08:33.280]  It's a military mission in North St. Louis.
[08:33.280 --> 08:35.840]  Heavily armored vehicles are rolling into town.
[08:35.840 --> 08:40.440]  And don't be alarmed if you see those over the next seven days rolling through your neighborhood.
[08:40.440 --> 08:44.840]  If you see military helicopters flying low over Minneapolis, do not be alarmed.
[08:44.840 --> 08:47.560]  The guns will be taken and no one will be able to be armed.
[08:47.560 --> 08:48.560]  We will take all weapons.
[08:48.560 --> 08:51.200]  Mr. and Mrs. America, turn them all in.
[08:51.200 --> 08:55.680]  Just really brainwash people into thinking about guns in a vastly different way.
[08:55.680 --> 08:56.680]  Enough.
[08:56.680 --> 08:57.680]  Enough.
[08:57.680 --> 08:58.680]  Enough.
[08:58.680 --> 08:59.680]  Enough.
[08:59.680 --> 09:03.360]  The Department of Homeland Security is apparently on a huge ammo buying spree.
[09:03.360 --> 09:07.480]  It comes out to like 1.6 billion rounds of ammunition.
[09:07.480 --> 09:11.800]  And as KSLA News 12 Jeff Farrell discovered, the clergy would help the government with
[09:11.800 --> 09:14.960]  potentially their biggest problem, us.
[09:14.960 --> 09:18.600]  So part of it is we have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to
[09:18.600 --> 09:22.880]  their parents, or kids belong to their families and recognize that kids belong to whole communities.
[09:22.880 --> 09:29.360]  If you got a business, you didn't build that, somebody else made that happen.
[09:29.360 --> 09:34.280]  Mercury-containing vaccines may help not harm kids according to two new studies in the journal
[09:34.280 --> 09:35.280]  Pediatrics.
[09:35.280 --> 09:40.480]  Black Hawk choppers soaring through the night sky, but this is only a drill.
[09:40.480 --> 09:48.640]  Many armed officers in Watertown search for the suspect, house to house.
[09:48.640 --> 09:57.920]  It's a joint military training exercise involving local police, also military.
[09:57.920 --> 10:00.360]  I am in my apartment, sir.
[10:00.360 --> 10:01.360]  The blacking song right now.
[10:01.360 --> 10:02.360]  I am inside.
[10:02.360 --> 10:03.840]  I have two words for you.
[10:03.840 --> 10:04.840]  Predator gloves.
[10:04.840 --> 10:05.840]  You will never see it coming.
[10:05.840 --> 10:15.720]  The dramatic scene played out in front of our cameras, parents grabbing their children
[10:15.720 --> 10:20.040]  and running after spending the night hunkering in their houses and then finding themselves
[10:20.040 --> 10:23.280]  face to face with the muzzle of a SWAT officer's rifle.
[10:23.280 --> 10:26.280]  They let them in the area, they told them they could come in and now they're coming
[10:26.280 --> 10:28.680]  in like they're trespassers punching and shoving people.
[10:28.680 --> 10:33.680]  We're not turning our guns in and we're not running and we're not backing down.
[10:33.680 --> 10:39.680]  If you want a commentation, we are on the march.
[10:39.680 --> 10:45.880]  The empire is on the run live from the info wars.com studios.
[10:45.880 --> 10:46.880]  It's Alex Jones.
[10:46.880 --> 10:47.880]  The potential for the disastrous run.
[10:47.880 --> 10:48.880]  We are on the march.
[10:48.880 --> 10:49.880]  We are on the march.
[10:49.880 --> 10:50.880]  The empire is on the run.
[10:50.880 --> 10:51.880]  Live from the info wars.com studios.
[10:51.880 --> 10:52.880]  It's Alex Jones.
[10:52.880 --> 11:07.560]  The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist.
[11:07.560 --> 11:14.280]  This is the heart of 1776.
[11:14.280 --> 11:18.880]  Now ladies and gentlemen, let's compare the Liberty Movement that we were just surveying
[11:18.880 --> 11:24.440]  there in that three year old promo where we basically lay out our Declaration of Independence
[11:24.440 --> 11:30.040]  part two against the globalist to a cross section that I played in the first segment
[11:30.040 --> 11:35.960]  of the people out protesting against the election of Donald J. Trump, a bunch of hysterical
[11:35.960 --> 11:42.360]  arrested development babies who over a hundred major universities that I have listed here
[11:42.360 --> 11:48.560]  in the last week have handed out coloring books, play dough, and yes, I found several
[11:48.560 --> 11:51.120]  that are even giving them pacifiers.
[11:51.120 --> 11:53.920]  You have to understand though, they're not joking.
[11:53.920 --> 12:00.000]  They want you to be arrested development and the government is your mommy and your daddy.
[12:00.000 --> 12:01.880]  This is the plan.
[12:01.880 --> 12:07.160]  I've told you this for years, but they're not playing around.
[12:07.160 --> 12:09.360]  They're not playing games now in business.
[12:09.360 --> 12:13.240]  They're saying don't even tell an employee that they're doing something wrong.
[12:13.240 --> 12:15.040]  That's a trigger.
[12:15.040 --> 12:20.160]  This is how you sabotage a country so you can't compete with China where people chain
[12:20.160 --> 12:24.400]  their children up by the millions every day on at power poles and light poles outside the
[12:24.400 --> 12:30.480]  factories work 16 hours on average and then come out and have one meal a day in a shipping
[12:30.480 --> 12:35.600]  container and then crap directly into rivers.
[12:35.600 --> 12:37.960]  The government could produce plumbing for them.
[12:37.960 --> 12:39.680]  They could have them in nice housing.
[12:39.680 --> 12:43.880]  They have entire cities that are completely empty that the elites own that are just sitting
[12:43.880 --> 12:48.640]  there empty as they use the farmer population that they're forcing off the land as total
[12:48.640 --> 12:49.640]  slaves.
[12:49.640 --> 12:55.800]  And if you call for the Chinese to not be total slaves, you are supposedly anti-Chinese.
[12:55.800 --> 12:59.600]  It is so incredibly cold-blooded, but let's compare the Liberty Movement and folks at
[12:59.600 --> 13:09.760]  Trump Rally to the dirty, ugly, stupid, lazy, disgusting, hateful, 300-pound toddlers.
[13:09.760 --> 13:28.320]  Here it is, total mental illness.
[13:28.320 --> 13:29.320]  But this is done by design.
[13:29.320 --> 13:35.960]  Meanwhile, Megan Kelly is out in a big interview saying, this is the year of the bully.
[13:35.960 --> 13:41.040]  Some political correctness, everything about it is nothing but pure absolute bullying.
[13:41.040 --> 13:44.280]  She acted like a horrible bully in those debates.
[13:44.280 --> 13:45.280]  She is a bully.
[13:45.280 --> 13:46.960]  She's misrepresented everything.
[13:46.960 --> 13:49.120]  DrudgeReport.com is linked to it.
[13:49.120 --> 13:54.520]  Exclusive Fox anchor, Megan Kelly describes scary bullying year of the Trump.
[13:54.520 --> 14:00.640]  Going back to Drudge with the headline that comes down to this, it's the year of her being
[14:00.640 --> 14:07.120]  full of bull, and that has a double entendre because I have described, others have, Trump
[14:07.120 --> 14:09.120]  as a bull.
[14:09.120 --> 14:10.120]  The man is a bull.
[14:10.120 --> 14:15.200]  I don't go off horoscopes, but they say there's something to it, I guess.
[14:15.200 --> 14:19.200]  I guess I'm an Aquarius bringing change to the world, but what is the sign of Trump?
[14:19.200 --> 14:20.200]  I don't even know that.
[14:20.200 --> 14:21.200]  Is he a bull?
[14:21.200 --> 14:25.760]  Because, I mean, the guy is the living embodiment of a bull.
[14:25.760 --> 14:29.600]  He goes to these big press dinners, dozens of them last year, and they all laugh at him,
[14:29.600 --> 14:33.840]  calling names, calling him ugly, say he's stupid, he just sits there proudly taking
[14:33.840 --> 14:34.840]  it.
[14:34.840 --> 14:39.240]  And I gotta say, my kinship to Trump is this, when I know I'm right, you could have a billion
[14:39.240 --> 14:43.240]  people laughing at me, and it means nothing.
[14:43.240 --> 14:45.600]  It means nothing.
[14:45.600 --> 14:50.280]  It means zero, because I know the truth, and I'm here trying to change their minds and
[14:50.280 --> 14:52.720]  actually lift them up.
[14:52.720 --> 14:56.520]  Okay, Trump being elected has already paid off, and then it's just credited to mainstream
[14:56.520 --> 15:00.400]  media, it's credited to pollsters, it's credited to the whole corrupt system, brought the idea
[15:00.400 --> 15:06.240]  of Americanism, not globalism, us running our own affairs, back to the fore.
[15:06.240 --> 15:10.440]  And that said, here it is, he talked to Putin yesterday, there's basically a transcript
[15:10.440 --> 15:15.160]  of the discussion released by the Russians and the United States, it's identical.
[15:15.160 --> 15:20.840]  DEF CON nuclear threat reduced to safest level following Donald Trump victory, it went from
[15:20.840 --> 15:26.760]  DEF condition or defense condition three, back to five, and it was reportedly secretly
[15:26.760 --> 15:30.400]  already at defense condition two.
[15:30.400 --> 15:37.080]  So there you go, ladies and gentlemen, that's out of the express.co.uk, meanwhile, Trump
[15:37.080 --> 15:41.320]  and Putin, we will destroy ISIS together, and he says he looks forward to working with
[15:41.320 --> 15:46.200]  Russia and the Russian people and having a great relationship.
[15:46.200 --> 15:50.680]  Trump and Putin vow to tackle ISIS together as they hold breakthrough talks after billionaires
[15:50.680 --> 15:51.680]  election.
[15:51.680 --> 15:57.840]  So we're going to get into all that, meanwhile, George Soros met with all of his cohorts over
[15:57.840 --> 16:04.240]  the weekend, NDC to figure out the new attack and the answer came, redouble all the standard
[16:04.240 --> 16:09.920]  efforts, race-baiting, divide and conquer, flooding the borders, collapsing the nation,
[16:09.920 --> 16:13.160]  everything they always do, so that's coming up.
[16:13.160 --> 16:18.000]  We're also going to look at the latest attack on free speech they're now watching, Google
[16:18.000 --> 16:22.280]  Facebook moved to, quote, restrict fake news and fake ads.
[16:22.280 --> 16:27.840]  Oh, really, nine times out of 10, the fake ads I see in the fake news is from the Democratic
[16:27.840 --> 16:30.280]  Party and the Soros crowd.
[16:30.280 --> 16:31.520]  That's a Reuters story.
[16:31.520 --> 16:35.720]  Remember, Amy Schumer, I just picked this on Sunday as a case point example, put out
[16:35.720 --> 16:41.120]  a fake headline with a fake newspaper from the past with trimming around it with yellowed
[16:41.120 --> 16:45.880]  paper to fool you with Trump saying how dumb he thinks conservatives are and how much he
[16:45.880 --> 16:46.880]  hates you.
[16:46.880 --> 16:50.800]  See, later at the bottom of the article, which he does only 10% statistically would actually
[16:50.800 --> 16:56.040]  get down that far, that it's, quote, fake and isn't a real quote, so she can't be sued,
[16:56.040 --> 16:57.040]  she thinks.
[16:57.040 --> 16:58.880]  This is the essence of organized fraud.
[16:58.880 --> 17:06.880]  Oh, but don't worry, the very same group now that engaged in all this deception and
[17:06.880 --> 17:11.160]  then allowed for years, killed Donald Trump, Facebook pages with hundreds of thousands
[17:11.160 --> 17:15.960]  of likes, they're now going to restrict free speech they're announcing today, Twitter's
[17:15.960 --> 17:18.720]  announcing it as well.
[17:18.720 --> 17:22.200]  But let me get to the big news here and we've got one of the top experts in the world on
[17:22.200 --> 17:29.040]  global government joining us, William F. Jasper, the New American magazine.
[17:29.040 --> 17:32.280]  I got interviewed by the New York Times yesterday and in the last six months they've called
[17:32.280 --> 17:36.480]  many times I have not called them back, not because I'm being arrogant or powerful.
[17:36.480 --> 17:43.360]  I told the lady, I said, listen, I don't want to be used as a prop for you to then write
[17:43.360 --> 17:47.480]  some article acting like you're really a journalist, the New York Times is one of the most deceptive
[17:47.480 --> 17:51.120]  outfits out there only behind the Washington Post.
[17:51.120 --> 17:55.000]  And I said, but I'll talk to you for 20 minutes and I did.
[17:55.000 --> 18:01.160]  She didn't write an article that I saw, but three others got written and it sounds like
[18:01.160 --> 18:06.120]  she was in a beehive of talking people and, you know, typing.
[18:06.120 --> 18:12.240]  And she learned about my conversation with Donald Trump on Friday, but then there's
[18:12.240 --> 18:14.600]  all these other articles.
[18:14.600 --> 18:15.600]  Just look at these.
[18:15.600 --> 18:19.640]  Again, and I'm not going to cover this because I'm in it, I'm going to cover this because
[18:19.640 --> 18:23.360]  it illustrates everything we're up against on every front, whether it's health care or
[18:23.360 --> 18:29.760]  sovereignty or taxes, the total wall of deception, globalism, a far right conspiracy theory buoyed
[18:29.760 --> 18:30.760]  by Trump.
[18:30.760 --> 18:34.760]  Now, globalism is the admitted planetary system being set up.
[18:34.760 --> 18:40.040]  Davos calls it globalism, the EU calls it globalism, State Department calls it globalism.
[18:40.040 --> 18:41.040]  That's the world system.
[18:41.040 --> 18:46.160]  It's like saying Alex Jones has a theory that a thing called the Pacific Ocean exists
[18:46.160 --> 18:50.640]  or Alex Jones has a theory that there's something called the continent of Australia.
[18:50.640 --> 18:56.960]  Alex Jones has a conspiracy theory that there's a species of shark called great white or he
[18:56.960 --> 19:04.160]  has a theory that there is a species called the, you know, great hammerhead.
[19:04.160 --> 19:05.720]  We're talking about things that exist.
[19:05.720 --> 19:10.520]  It's kind of like Gibbs, the Obama's former press secretary said, listen, I was told years
[19:10.520 --> 19:16.080]  after the predator drone kill program existed, everybody knows it's real, all of the news
[19:16.080 --> 19:20.200]  to come out and say it doesn't exist, they all start laughing or, oh, if you like your
[19:20.200 --> 19:21.200]  daughter, you can keep it.
[19:21.200 --> 19:22.200]  That was a good one.
[19:22.200 --> 19:23.320]  Tell them another one.
[19:23.320 --> 19:29.560]  They are still doing this, hoping they can con the public back into a trance and hoping
[19:29.560 --> 19:33.680]  or just never let the debate get to, hey, we don't want globalism.
[19:33.680 --> 19:36.240]  They just keep going, excuse me, don't know what that is.
[19:36.240 --> 19:37.240]  Don't confuse.
[19:37.240 --> 19:43.400]  It's a gun wall, but that's, there's three articles in the New York Times, but a whole
[19:43.400 --> 19:47.920]  bunch of others all over the media saying it doesn't exist.
[19:47.920 --> 19:52.480]  These aren't the droids you're looking for move along.
[19:52.480 --> 19:54.040]  And oh, by the way, we're all racist.
[19:54.040 --> 19:55.040]  So that's all they've got.
[19:55.040 --> 19:56.720]  Like we don't want to be in a global government.
[19:56.720 --> 19:57.720]  Shut up, racist.
[19:57.720 --> 19:58.720]  It doesn't exist.
[19:58.720 --> 19:59.720]  We'll be back.
[19:59.720 --> 20:03.000]  We use cell phones against our heads every day.
[20:03.000 --> 20:07.200]  But now a landmark U.S. government study confirms increased health risks from exposure

[22:00.640 --> 22:04.720]  Your community's aging water infrastructure systems are very likely to be contaminated

[24:24.280 --> 24:29.280]  Look in the children's blood.
[24:29.280 --> 24:44.000]  The NSA wants to crack with little chips everything drones that are sold in stores
[24:44.000 --> 24:45.000]  do.
[24:45.000 --> 24:49.280]  Just like all your cell phones since the 96 Telecommunications Act have cracker chips.
[24:49.280 --> 24:50.600]  I told folks about it at the time.
[24:50.600 --> 24:55.200]  It was actually in the Congressional budget I had experts on, but oh, that's a conspiracy
[24:55.200 --> 24:56.200]  theory.
[24:56.200 --> 24:57.200]  No such thing.
[24:57.200 --> 25:03.040]  But now they can basically take over the drones.
[25:03.040 --> 25:08.640]  And this is what the Panoptagon Technocracies about in MIT's own words is everything wired
[25:08.640 --> 25:11.920]  into a global system they control.
[25:11.920 --> 25:17.080]  And in one New York Times article yesterday where they again just say, I'm imagining all
[25:17.080 --> 25:18.080]  this.
[25:18.080 --> 25:22.680]  Quotes where I say it's a global government calling itself a technocracy with digital
[25:22.680 --> 25:29.720]  embedded platform systems in all telecommunications, all appliances to track and trace and control
[25:29.720 --> 25:31.120]  everything we do.
[25:31.120 --> 25:35.280]  It is the ultimate form of slavery.
[25:35.280 --> 25:38.160]  And then they go, wow, the imagination of this guy.
[25:38.160 --> 25:40.720]  I'm quoting the Davos group.
[25:40.720 --> 25:42.800]  I'm quoting MIT.
[25:42.800 --> 25:45.360]  I'm quoting the NSA whistleblowers.
[25:45.360 --> 25:50.360]  I have the former technical head on every month he's been in studio.
[25:50.360 --> 25:55.840]  We went out to dinner and there were literal spies following us.
[25:55.840 --> 26:03.000]  Oh, but the New York Times tells you it doesn't exist.
[26:03.000 --> 26:04.000]  And don't get into it.
[26:04.000 --> 26:06.200]  Don't look at it or we'll call you racist.
[26:06.200 --> 26:07.200]  Don't go over there.
[26:07.200 --> 26:09.320]  Don't say you don't want Obamacare.
[26:09.320 --> 26:12.320]  Everyone knows races are lying and saying it's not free.
[26:12.320 --> 26:15.680]  Well, here's the good news, it doesn't work anymore.
[26:15.680 --> 26:22.560]  Now I said NSA, the way they pitch it is, AT&T and NASA to build national drone tracking
[26:22.560 --> 26:23.560]  system.
[26:23.560 --> 26:28.240]  Oh, but as we go back, telecommunications companies are basically run by the NSA and
[26:28.240 --> 26:29.720]  they hardwire the systems in.
[26:29.720 --> 26:34.360]  That all came out via Snowden, but that was already in the Telecommunications Act of 96.
[26:34.360 --> 26:37.240]  That's when it really went ubiquitous system-wide.
[26:37.240 --> 26:44.160]  The company wants to protect drones from hackers, oh, thank God, with backdoors in it.
[26:44.160 --> 26:48.880]  That's why it's also in my new stack today from the Associated Press that, oh, backdoors
[26:48.880 --> 26:56.440]  put in chips and cell phones by the government over decades fell into the hands of the communist
[26:56.440 --> 26:57.440]  Chinese.
[26:57.440 --> 27:03.960]  Oh, like Hollywood's falling into the hands, like the Panama Canal's falling into the hands,
[27:03.960 --> 27:06.320]  like the defense industries are falling into the hands.
[27:06.320 --> 27:10.480]  Oh, it's falling into the hands, wonder why, because the global deal was made more than
[27:10.480 --> 27:13.400]  30 years ago.
[27:13.400 --> 27:16.440]  And Donald Trump knows about it, it's trying to ally with Russia.
[27:16.440 --> 27:19.840]  They came out in the meeting and said, we're allying with Russia to stop China.
[27:19.840 --> 27:24.400]  And now the traders in our government are flipping out, no, and he doesn't know what
[27:24.400 --> 27:28.800]  he's doing, you better back off, you better stop right now, Trump.
[27:28.800 --> 27:32.520]  Now listen, you can do whatever you want, but you're not gonna, you're not gonna not
[27:32.520 --> 27:35.560]  have a war with Russia, is that understood right now?
[27:35.560 --> 27:40.920]  And as our friend, they've only got a military five times bigger than Russia's, they've only
[27:40.920 --> 27:45.480]  got bases everywhere, we only sold out to them, Trump, it was a great deal.
[27:45.480 --> 27:48.440]  We all get to sit on the boards, these big corporations with all those slaves over there
[27:48.440 --> 27:49.920]  now, now you don't try that, huh?
[27:49.920 --> 27:53.480]  Trump's like, I'm gonna wake the American people up just like Brexit in the UK and Europe,
[27:53.480 --> 27:54.480]  we're gonna get out of this.
[27:54.480 --> 27:57.720]  No, you're not, we're gonna say it doesn't exist.
[27:57.720 --> 28:01.640]  So next hour, I'm gonna show clip after clip of world leaders saying global governance,
[28:01.640 --> 28:05.920]  global government, the TPP and NAFTA and GATA for global government, global governance,
[28:05.920 --> 28:06.920]  the definitions.
[28:06.920 --> 28:12.560]  So you'll have that video to send to people and say, world government's being set up
[28:12.560 --> 28:16.160]  and Trump's trying to block it, and that's why they're so pissed.
[28:16.160 --> 28:22.720]  But oh look, here's Obama, Obama on Trump's election, we have to guard against a rise
[28:22.720 --> 28:28.680]  and accrued sort of nationalism, so he goes with an olive branch to Obama, he's nice,
[28:28.680 --> 28:33.480]  he goes with an olive branch to Congress and everybody else, and what's their response?
[28:33.480 --> 28:38.480]  They're all, including Republicans, stabbing him in the back 24-7, Lou Dobbs is right saying
[28:38.480 --> 28:45.560]  he cannot trust the ultimate weasel, and that of course is Paul Ryan and his baby Galactic
[28:45.560 --> 28:50.160]  Weasel, it's his name, that's Ren's previous, but that's what's going on.
[28:50.160 --> 28:56.400]  And so meeting with world leaders, Obama warned today of the need to guard, we must guard
[28:56.400 --> 29:00.760]  against not the rise of the military industrial complex, not globalism, but no, no, no, the
[29:00.760 --> 29:05.000]  rise of nationalism both at home and abroad during a press conference in Greece, one we
[29:05.000 --> 29:11.240]  got for the election of Donald Trump, alongside Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tisparis, if I
[29:11.240 --> 29:14.240]  pronounce that right, who of course came in claiming he stopped the takeover and then
[29:14.240 --> 29:16.200]  appointed a bunch of globalists in charge.
[29:16.200 --> 29:22.800]  So what they're doing is the same old deal, demonizing nationalism, saying it's racist,
[29:22.800 --> 29:26.360]  saying it's evil, that foreign banks can't come in and loot you like a third world country,
[29:26.360 --> 29:32.000]  but then meanwhile, populism takes over the world, Bloomberg, oh, the great threat, Noam
[29:32.000 --> 29:36.200]  Chomsky, the Republican Party has become the most dangerous organization in world history,
[29:36.200 --> 29:40.160]  because they might actually have self-determination and not be under global fascism and the whole
[29:40.160 --> 29:44.640]  fake left that apologizes for it while claiming they're critical of it, meanwhile, a Trump
[29:44.640 --> 29:49.480]  doctrine America first, how, how horrible, but, globalism doesn't exist.
[29:49.480 --> 29:56.480]  Here on the march, the empire's on the run, Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[30:49.480 --> 30:53.120]  Officials and other staff who work closely alongside Hillary have previously reported
[30:53.120 --> 30:56.360]  her problems with angry tantrums on numerous occasions.
[30:56.360 --> 31:24.360]  You can find more reports like this at infowars.com.
[31:24.360 --> 31:50.080]  You will find
[31:50.080 --> 32:09.240]  a link in the description below.
[32:09.240 --> 32:12.880]  It's been something that I've been working on for a long time, Alex, because I think
[32:12.880 --> 32:15.080]  it's very, very important.
[32:15.080 --> 32:21.760]  What the aging process is, is when the cell replicates, we lose a little bit of our telomeres.
[32:21.760 --> 32:24.080]  Telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes.
[32:24.080 --> 32:26.080]  And when it runs out, you start dying.
[32:26.080 --> 32:30.440]  We chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different clinical trials.
[32:30.440 --> 32:33.280]  It's one of the most effective substances in the world.
[32:33.280 --> 32:34.960]  It works like an antioxidant.
[32:34.960 --> 32:37.880]  It works to repair nerve growth factor.
[32:37.880 --> 32:41.040]  So this is a formula to deliver the maximum amount.
[32:41.040 --> 32:42.080]  It's in powder form.
[32:42.080 --> 32:45.640]  We have so many five-star reviews.
[32:45.640 --> 32:46.640]  I take this.
[32:46.640 --> 32:47.640]  This is the product that I take.
[32:47.640 --> 32:48.640]  infowarslife.com.
[32:48.640 --> 32:51.080]  In the profit we make, we fight the globalists.
[32:51.080 --> 32:52.080]  We fight the New World Order.

[33:18.760 --> 33:23.000]  And here's our president just a few hours ago in Greece at a press conference telling
[33:23.000 --> 33:25.360]  us he's discovered the enemy, the big threat.
[33:25.360 --> 33:26.600]  And guess who it is?
[33:26.600 --> 33:30.960]  Not the multinational corporations, not the globalists that are openly announcing world
[33:30.960 --> 33:31.960]  government.
[33:31.960 --> 33:32.960]  No, no, no.
[33:32.960 --> 33:37.360]  It's the nation states, which we keep telling people the globalists are here to shut down
[33:37.360 --> 33:39.480]  nation states and attacking nationalism.
[33:39.480 --> 33:43.280]  But simultaneously, that doesn't exist.
[33:43.280 --> 33:44.320]  But it does exist.
[33:44.320 --> 33:48.000]  And so here's the president telling us about the grave threat.
[33:48.000 --> 33:58.480]  I do believe, separate and apart from any particular election or movement, that we are
[33:58.480 --> 34:14.000]  going to have to guard against a rise in a crude sort of nationalism or ethnic identity
[34:14.000 --> 34:24.080]  or tribalism that is built around an us and a them.
[34:24.080 --> 34:33.520]  And I will never apologize for saying that the future of humanity and the future of the
[34:33.520 --> 34:40.840]  world is going to be defined by what we have in common, as opposed to those things that
[34:40.840 --> 34:44.640]  separate us and ultimately lead us into conflict.
[34:44.640 --> 34:46.760]  Now that's radio free Europe.
[34:46.760 --> 34:51.240]  That's captured Europe by the OECD, by the multinational Robert Barron coalition that
[34:51.240 --> 34:52.800]  took over at the end of World War II.
[34:52.800 --> 34:53.800]  It's declassified.
[34:53.800 --> 34:57.800]  That's who oversaw our elections and tried to steal them, but it failed.
[34:57.800 --> 35:02.200]  And there is the president knowing full well George Soros and it's in the WikiLeaks admit
[35:02.200 --> 35:03.880]  we're going to create racial divides.
[35:03.880 --> 35:06.280]  We're going to play groups off against each other.
[35:06.280 --> 35:09.880]  We're going to send groups of black people into Trump rallies to make it look like a race
[35:09.880 --> 35:11.040]  war.
[35:11.040 --> 35:18.720]  And so we should take the clip of everything they say and then just put behind it the WikiLeaks
[35:18.720 --> 35:23.400]  and put behind it the clips of all these groups spewing racism and kill the cops and kill
[35:23.400 --> 35:25.800]  whitey or you look like Trump because you're white.
[35:25.800 --> 35:27.360]  I'm going to beat you up.
[35:27.360 --> 35:28.760]  This is what's being pushed.
[35:28.760 --> 35:30.920]  And listen, that's a cue to listeners and viewers.
[35:30.920 --> 35:32.120]  You want to win this war.
[35:32.120 --> 35:36.640]  We're already beginning to win, but we're in the middle of the war right now.
[35:36.640 --> 35:37.800]  I don't have the crew to do this.
[35:37.800 --> 35:42.920]  I'm running back there during breaks directing two or three editors was like five editors,
[35:42.920 --> 35:48.280]  but several have been working on other stuff to take these videos and start adding things
[35:48.280 --> 35:52.520]  to them because they go viral and millions of people see it and we just show the hypocrisy.
[35:52.520 --> 35:56.000]  But you've got to show them saying there's no global government and then show the very
[35:56.000 --> 35:58.080]  same people calling for global government.
[35:58.080 --> 36:02.360]  You've got to show Obama saying Obamacare will be free and then showing it's not free.
[36:02.360 --> 36:06.840]  You have to remind people because the general public has goldfish memories, but you can
[36:06.840 --> 36:10.240]  be programmed and it's starting to happen.
[36:10.240 --> 36:13.000]  But I need viewers and listeners when I make these cues on air.
[36:13.000 --> 36:14.000]  This is a war.
[36:14.000 --> 36:15.080]  This isn't a radio show or TV show.
[36:15.080 --> 36:18.600]  This is this is an emergency transmission for the military lessons is why the police
[36:18.600 --> 36:23.640]  listen by foreign governments listen because I address this as it is a culture war with
[36:23.640 --> 36:25.520]  globalists taking over.
[36:25.520 --> 36:31.520]  We need a unified culture of truth and justice and reprocess and unity and free association
[36:31.520 --> 36:33.020]  and coming together.
[36:33.020 --> 36:37.760]  They're the ones creating a race based culture and religion divided culture in the broken
[36:37.760 --> 36:42.240]  strategy of Balkanization known by British intelligence is the great game.
[36:42.240 --> 36:45.320]  I'm giving you all terms you can go look up and learn about.
[36:45.320 --> 36:50.440]  Go study the British great game or divide and conquer under the Romans and then you
[36:50.440 --> 36:54.840]  go to WikiLeaks and they use the terms divide and conquer to quote keep us dumb.
[36:54.840 --> 36:56.680]  They go on and say we're in deep trouble.
[36:56.680 --> 36:58.360]  They're not staying asleep.
[36:58.360 --> 37:01.720]  We're going to have to use demographic warfare.
[37:01.720 --> 37:05.400]  Dig warfare is race war.
[37:05.400 --> 37:09.640]  So he's up there as a referee going hey whoa whoa.
[37:09.640 --> 37:13.020]  If you oppose globalism which doesn't exist for the New York Times.
[37:13.020 --> 37:20.920]  If you want nationalism then you basically are a racist.
[37:20.920 --> 37:23.960]  This is what they're selling the idea that you've got to open your borders.
[37:23.960 --> 37:24.960]  Everybody around the world.
[37:24.960 --> 37:29.360]  Give them free stuff or you're a racist when all they're trying to do is conquer the sovereign
[37:29.360 --> 37:30.360]  countries.
[37:30.360 --> 37:37.400]  Obama gave a UN speech just a month ago where he said we've got to give up national sovereignty.
[37:37.400 --> 37:39.400]  Can we find that clip too?
[37:39.400 --> 37:43.160]  That Americans have to be ready to give up their sovereignty to an international group.
[37:43.160 --> 37:47.720]  Dude, I know you're finishing an edit in there of like four minutes of world leaders calling
[37:47.720 --> 37:53.440]  for global government but I want to add at the beginning Obama's last speech of the UN
[37:53.440 --> 37:57.920]  just type into YouTube it's so we have the clip it's Obama says America must give up
[37:57.920 --> 37:58.920]  sovereignty.
[37:58.920 --> 38:01.000]  And he says listen it's tough for me at home.
[38:01.000 --> 38:05.440]  I got a bunch of backwards scum basically and I'm there trying to sell them on global
[38:05.440 --> 38:06.440]  government.
[38:06.440 --> 38:07.440]  There it is.
[38:07.440 --> 38:12.160]  Obama tells the UN giving up freedom enhances American security.
[38:12.160 --> 38:18.880]  And the date on that was my memory as a month ago was September 20th so it was more than
[38:18.880 --> 38:19.880]  a month ago.
[38:19.880 --> 38:24.360]  So there you go ladies and gentlemen Obama thinks U.S. sovereignty overrated should cede
[38:24.360 --> 38:25.880]  freedoms to UN.
[38:25.880 --> 38:31.840]  I am convinced that in the long run giving up some freedom of action enhances our security.
[38:31.840 --> 38:36.640]  I mean listen Ted Bundy would get 16 year old girls in his yellow Volkswagen he bought
[38:36.640 --> 38:37.640]  it because it was non-threatening.
[38:37.640 --> 38:41.080]  He wore little gray suits and act nerd leaving a handsome and say hey I'd like to take you
[38:41.080 --> 38:45.880]  out for some ice cream in a movie and they were young girls he needed not to target older
[38:45.880 --> 38:50.520]  ones that were smart or worldly and he'd get them in the car and he'd take them and he'd
[38:50.520 --> 38:54.600]  say listen I got a gun I'm going to blow your head off bitch but if you put these handcuffs
[38:54.600 --> 38:58.200]  on I'm going to be real nice and he's listen bitch I'm going to call you a racist and blow
[38:58.200 --> 39:02.840]  your head off okay and send a SWAT team this is what the media is doing you don't put these
[39:02.840 --> 39:08.640]  frickin handcuffs on you put the handcuffs on he'd right in the nose good you come with
[39:08.640 --> 39:12.680]  me he'd hold her by the hair and drive her to his house with a basement he took he'd
[39:12.680 --> 39:18.240]  drive in that garage he'd take her in there for a good two weeks of hardcore torture.
[39:18.240 --> 39:22.000]  That's what Obama just told you listen you give up a little bit of freedom of action
[39:22.000 --> 39:25.960]  you let me tie your arms and legs up I'm going to take real good care of you you understand
[39:25.960 --> 39:34.040]  me there's no world government we love UK and we're not knee deep in blood rituals we're
[39:34.040 --> 39:41.520]  going to take care of you I'm showing you their spirit you'll not get away from America
[39:41.520 --> 39:48.200]  we almost had you they're all just panicking this Jones tells it like it is his spirit
[39:48.200 --> 39:54.040]  Trump says what do we do they're in panic mode right now because I see them for the
[39:54.040 --> 40:02.680]  scum they are little gremlin rats and Obama was so shaken and slow and he sat there and
[40:02.680 --> 40:06.960]  said all that because he knows he said too much two months ago about we world government
[40:06.960 --> 40:13.480]  so now we're just going to have all new promos about Americanism versus globalism show what
[40:13.480 --> 40:21.840]  globalism is versus nationalism and then show them lecture you that it does not exist three
[40:21.840 --> 40:29.000]  New York Times articles so many am I can even read them all I read two of them saying world
[40:29.000 --> 40:34.240]  government doesn't exist globalism even globalism doesn't exist that print me the definition
[40:34.240 --> 40:37.760]  of globalism before they change you know it'll probably say it doesn't exist now globalism
[40:37.760 --> 40:41.840]  is the modern world system set up by David Rockefeller it came out of the Britain Woods
[40:41.840 --> 40:50.760]  agreement it's taught in all graduate student political classes but they say it doesn't
[40:50.760 --> 40:55.840]  exist also print me global government definition and global governance definition I mean you
[40:55.840 --> 40:59.120]  read the council on foreign relations bi-monthly book foreign affairs you read the Washington
[40:59.120 --> 41:04.400]  Post publication on foreign affairs you read it's all global government global governance
[41:04.400 --> 41:06.840]  here's how we're going to do it here's how we're going to take over here's how we're
[41:06.840 --> 41:09.760]  going to control the infrastructure here's how we're going to end the family everyone
[41:09.760 --> 41:13.000]  live in 200 square foot control pods under total surveillance I mean you're reading
[41:13.000 --> 41:16.600]  this stuff and this is them right and we're putting flour in the water but hasn't lowered
[41:16.600 --> 41:20.400]  fertility enough we got to increase it but the public will complains we've got to ridicule
[41:20.400 --> 41:27.520]  those that talk about it call conspiracy and just reading the total criminal battle plan
[41:27.520 --> 41:35.640]  and they just count on you not being able to take the truth and it's so compartmentalized
[41:35.640 --> 41:41.480]  only the big scientists and social engineers scientists run the new world war and they
[41:41.480 --> 41:46.320]  think you're all animals and then they got politicians that they kind of control it
[41:46.320 --> 41:53.520]  and and and have the wealth but it is scientists that are actually running it and they actually
[41:53.520 --> 41:58.760]  come up with the policies that fit into the larger cosmology and man it is nasty you know
[41:58.760 --> 42:04.560]  the Nazis were scientific and it's super cold-blooded folks and the decisions been made that you're
[42:04.560 --> 42:09.520]  an animal and you don't have a right to exist and then they help turn our young people into
[42:09.520 --> 42:17.000]  the equivalent of giant 300 pound toddlers and then when they they put memos out in over
[42:17.000 --> 42:20.960]  a hundred major universities there's articles on m4s.com for mainstream news which reported
[42:20.960 --> 42:26.560]  like it's a good thing Wall Street Journal Associated Press they're like well if Trump
[42:26.560 --> 42:31.480]  does win tonight we need you to come to the counselors we're going to have cry-ins that's
[42:31.480 --> 42:35.480]  what they're called there's going to be Play-Doh and coloring books and we're going to have
[42:35.480 --> 42:40.400]  tinker toys I'm not joking tinker toys and then 20 year old people go and learn to roll
[42:40.400 --> 42:45.840]  around and be pathetic to be conquered you want to know what global 21st century warfare
[42:45.840 --> 42:55.400]  looks like you're seeing it folks absolute total warfare with hardcore mercs who were
[42:55.400 --> 43:02.760]  into the psychopathic behavior running the show so I mean Noam Chomsky they have this
[43:02.760 --> 43:07.720]  whole leftist university funded combine that exposes the corporations and how they run
[43:07.720 --> 43:13.800]  it and how it's bad the answers more big government more leftist institutions he tells you the
[43:13.800 --> 43:18.320]  truth but then the answer is tyranny and he says owning guns is racist and all this stuff
[43:18.320 --> 43:22.200]  to conquer us and then he says the republican party has become the most dangerous organization
[43:22.200 --> 43:27.720]  in world history that's right to the technocrat scientific group that's creating a breakaway
[43:27.720 --> 43:33.760]  civilization is the truest form of elitism and racism against the entire humanity and
[43:33.760 --> 43:41.440]  Noam Chomsky has been down the bowels of this thing a veritable Noam pissing on everyone
[43:41.440 --> 43:45.160]  and he thinks he's better than you and he can't stand you're almost out of his grasp
[43:45.160 --> 43:52.260]  he just cannot stand the renaissance it is burning him up at every single level the pseudo
[43:52.260 --> 43:57.040]  intellectual I mean I could write one of his books in two days but just add the foppish
[43:57.040 --> 44:02.160]  leftism to it just I mean just bang out this pseudo-intellectual tribe everyone just logs
[44:02.160 --> 44:07.080]  you oh you're so intellectual oh you have liver spots and curly hair and you kind of
[44:07.080 --> 44:15.600]  waddle around and talk slow oh wow thank you for everything Noam Chomsky thank you thank
[44:15.600 --> 44:21.840]  you for what you've done in the universities and this whole corporate wrecked garbage see
[44:21.840 --> 44:26.520]  they don't want the rise of men they don't want individualism they want centralized controls
[44:26.520 --> 44:34.640]  so these people that have insecurity issues can can mount our heads on the wall metaphorically
[44:34.640 --> 44:40.560]  so populism is taking over the world oh no populism what's popular remember George Will
[44:40.560 --> 44:45.480]  you're not going to have a mere plurality or majority run things we have a sovereign
[44:45.480 --> 44:50.760]  party of sovereignty you can't have Trump the White House has already stabbed Trump
[44:50.760 --> 44:54.320]  in the back he didn't know how bad the White House was he didn't know all the work he didn't
[44:54.320 --> 44:58.840]  know anything no he was gracious there's transcripts coming out and there's already partial ones
[44:58.840 --> 45:01.840]  where he's like oh Trump's and Trump and and and and and and and and and and and and Obama's
[45:01.840 --> 45:05.440]  like it's really hard with 4,000 people he'll be hard for you to run and that guy's got
[45:05.440 --> 45:10.440]  hundreds of thousands working for him and and Trump's like oh my guess oh that's how
[45:10.440 --> 45:15.480]  he talks to his enemies oh thank you for teaching me Obama thank you for teaching me how I work
[45:15.480 --> 45:23.280]  18 hours a day and I'm a bull and I'm self-made and you're this little CIA nothing so here's
[45:23.280 --> 45:33.520]  here's Bloomberg populism takes over the world oh no when you first encounter the word populism
[45:33.520 --> 45:37.200]  oh they're teaching everyone what it means you might just say it doesn't exist then we
[45:37.200 --> 45:41.600]  wouldn't have to you might think it's close to cousins of democracy with all the positive
[45:41.600 --> 45:46.600]  connotations that go along with it and for some it may well seem a purveyor of the process
[45:46.600 --> 45:50.240]  by which politicians harness the will of the majority and they go about how dangerous and
[45:50.240 --> 45:55.600]  fascist and evil it is and we've got Obama and we've got Noam Chomsky and we've got everybody
[45:55.600 --> 46:04.760]  here just oh so elitist so hanging on their every word talking very softly like this incredible
[46:04.760 --> 46:13.040]  knowledge they're imparting to us an American first doctrine Trump but then of course again
[46:13.040 --> 46:16.680]  I'm gonna cover this the next hour here it is just just one of the New York Times articles
[46:16.680 --> 46:24.040]  globalism a far right conspiracy theory buoyed by Trump that's like saying if you claim that
[46:24.040 --> 46:29.360]  on Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington DC at the end of it is the capital do you believe
[46:29.360 --> 46:35.840]  these people it's like the New York Times in 2008 literally wrote that I was in Chantilly
[46:35.840 --> 46:42.840]  Virginia imagining black helicopters and Marines and troops and secret service and Hillary
[46:42.840 --> 46:47.680]  and Obama meeting and secret and Richard and Haas coming out and flipping me off and I
[46:47.680 --> 46:52.520]  mean all this is on video the head of the CFR at the time none of this existed all on
[46:52.520 --> 46:58.080]  HD video they said that I was having a full-on schizophrenic hallucination now you talk about
[46:58.080 --> 47:03.920]  a con game man you imagine telling your readers that that I'm insane and that it doesn't exist
[47:03.920 --> 47:11.480]  takes a lot of WAVOS a lot of wood spa and I guess as long as it held with the readers
[47:11.480 --> 47:15.720]  oh the bottom is falling out of the New York Times there there there there subscriptions
[47:15.720 --> 47:23.560]  in profit in the third quarter dropped you look this up 97.5% and a bunch of other newspapers
[47:23.560 --> 47:29.320]  it as well just you're you're gone you told by those no way Trump could be elected you
[47:29.320 --> 47:34.760]  just kept saying it 50,000 times a week over and over again drooling the sycophantically
[47:34.760 --> 47:40.400]  everyone already hated you and thought you were a joke CNN all but now now you now you're
[47:40.400 --> 47:45.800]  tripling down globalism this global system how we must embrace globalism and how it's
[47:45.800 --> 47:49.880]  good to have corporations run everything and global carbon taxes and global standardization
[47:49.880 --> 47:57.720]  yada yada it doesn't exist now and it gets worse even man and Alex Jones are racist that's
[47:57.720 --> 48:03.000]  right there's no quotes there's no proof there's no nothing it's just we just we are and thank
[48:03.000 --> 48:08.040]  God that we've got the New York Times there to save us and it just goes on to say Trump
[48:08.040 --> 48:13.120]  believes in this imaginary thing where we all have one side of trade deals for special
[48:13.120 --> 48:19.840]  interest to rape us yeah it'll be real imaginary when he puts us on the same standards as China
[48:19.840 --> 48:24.880]  for coal power plants and your electricity drops and watch what happens there more jobs
[48:24.880 --> 48:31.040]  you real simple crap like that that you say doesn't exist I'll never forget just just
[48:31.040 --> 48:34.720]  five six years ago they would deny carbon taxes existed then some of the friend admitting
[48:34.720 --> 48:38.520]  they existed I mean this is this whole game they play so we're gonna come back and get
[48:38.520 --> 48:43.960]  into just the idiocy of their minions of their servants when they're talking about how they're
[48:43.960 --> 48:49.800]  gonna battle the ignorance of nationalist when your supporters literally are the biggest
[48:49.800 --> 48:57.480]  disenfranchised victim sad but still dangerous buffoons this world's ever seen now before
[48:57.480 --> 49:04.520]  I go any further we are running some really great specials and it's more important than
[49:04.520 --> 49:09.080]  ever to support this broadcast you can see how info wars pays off for you and your family
[49:09.080 --> 49:14.760]  you get over the top high quality products that we investigate and personally use and
[49:14.760 --> 49:20.840]  you support an organization that is completely committed to battling fearlessly for your
[49:20.840 --> 49:25.400]  freedom and our freedom together we are brothers and sisters every race color and creed wanting
[49:25.400 --> 49:31.320]  self-determination and I always use the word win-win but it's a good term to use and they
[49:31.320 --> 49:35.280]  make the point in the movie arrival that's a good film with a good message overall those
[49:35.280 --> 49:38.760]  got Chinese propaganda kind of as propaganda and of course but what movie doesn't know
[49:38.760 --> 49:42.720]  they've taken over basically everybody should know how deep we are in our globalism already
[49:42.720 --> 49:51.760]  but a zero some game a win-win and I'm always about a win-win civilization is about a win-win
[49:51.760 --> 49:56.520]  the more you have a win-win the more you have a civilization a 360 win is what everyone
[49:56.520 --> 50:01.600]  should want and I at a Christian level spiritual level it's not like something I do compulsively
[50:01.600 --> 50:08.360]  I do it innately that believe in win-win I just am so nice I'm so helpful I'm so giving
[50:08.360 --> 50:13.040]  I'm so sharing in my personal life but not and then I found out weak evil people always
[50:13.040 --> 50:16.960]  think I must be weak because I was being so nice so I've learned to withhold that from
[50:16.960 --> 50:21.200]  people that don't deserve it because because if you give the average scumbag we're gonna
[50:21.200 --> 50:28.160]  skip this break you give the average programmed person this win-win they take it as a weakness
[50:28.160 --> 50:32.840]  they take it that oh I must betray this person as quickly as possible must get this break
[50:32.840 --> 50:38.720]  I must I must metaphysically cut their head off as fast as I can and then kill the golden
[50:38.720 --> 50:44.600]  goose because they were taught how to not live in civilization and a zero some game
[50:44.600 --> 50:50.440]  they were caught to live in a pie system where the pie is so many grams and so many inches
[50:50.440 --> 50:56.240]  wide and so many inches deep and that's it forever and they teach you that that if someone
[50:56.240 --> 51:00.880]  else is getting something you're losing not that oh my god there's a big middle class
[51:00.880 --> 51:06.520]  neighborhood being built nearby and there's people with money moving in I should go you
[51:06.520 --> 51:09.880]  know get a piece of property down the road they're gonna build that way in a few years
[51:09.880 --> 51:13.400]  I bet they'll put a gas station there I bet I could sell that property for three times
[51:13.400 --> 51:17.840]  what it's worth no no no no you get mad and then get pissed that people with money are
[51:17.840 --> 51:25.360]  moving in and that's why you're a loser or you don't get involved in the discussions
[51:25.360 --> 51:29.640]  from day one about what's built where so you're a major player in the whole system when it
[51:29.640 --> 51:33.680]  comes in no no no you just remove yourself and then let the government run your life
[51:33.680 --> 51:38.720]  when it's there to absolutely give you the minimum to keep you under their control but
[51:38.720 --> 51:43.640]  then you're all pissed with the government thinking it's your mommy your daddy but pissed
[51:43.640 --> 51:48.400]  at everyone else you see doing well because they're not under the false program you're
[51:48.400 --> 51:56.480]  you're living in so they inflict their minions with psychological wounds and they don't understand
[51:56.480 --> 52:00.640]  why they're so desperate they don't understand why they're so unhappy they don't understand
[52:00.640 --> 52:05.360]  why things just get worse and worse they keep doubling tripling quadrupling down the past
[52:05.360 --> 52:09.880]  lives they keep serving the system more and more they keep buying into the next level
[52:09.880 --> 52:14.640]  that's supposedly going to deliver them all this they don't look at Venezuela or Cuba
[52:14.640 --> 52:18.680]  or other communist countries like North Korea what happened in Russia or China they don't
[52:18.680 --> 52:27.000]  look at how it creates abject hell all they know is that if they could get something free
[52:27.000 --> 52:32.560]  from someone else they could win zero some game they don't understand 360 win a term
[52:32.560 --> 52:41.560]  I coin now that is utopia a 360 win is utopia it's a singularity of a zero some game where
[52:41.560 --> 52:46.400]  when we capture the understanding of energy and matter then it will only be intellect
[52:46.400 --> 52:52.440]  and and vision and creativity that will be the currency and imagine that that's what
[52:52.440 --> 52:57.000]  you can call heaven the problem is for free will to exist there must always be the will
[52:57.000 --> 53:03.700]  to be destructive and bad and so we will never reach a perfect nirvana in this third fourth
[53:03.700 --> 53:09.480]  dimension plane every ancient culture said we will transcend to a fifth sixth dimension
[53:09.480 --> 53:13.960]  the enemy tells you all day that doesn't exist because they are continually at war with
[53:13.960 --> 53:19.280]  that because they understand it's a zero some ascension but they're always trying to interface
[53:19.280 --> 53:24.960]  with it to get knowledge from the ether so they can use it in this lower plane to dominate
[53:24.960 --> 53:35.480]  everyone this is the big secret these are fallen people folks they're scum now can trump
[53:35.480 --> 53:42.600]  actually deliver even 10% of a zero some game to everybody a 360 win that's up to us but
[53:42.600 --> 53:47.440]  his spirit he's aggressive he's dominant he doesn't want to be pushed around he likes
[53:47.440 --> 53:55.160]  to dominate other powerful scumbags he likes to hunt them I guess he looked up a zodiac
[53:55.160 --> 53:59.080]  not that I believe any of this but it's fine I guess he's a Gemini and a Chinese zodiac
[53:59.080 --> 54:05.240]  he's a dog I'm calling him a lion or a bull but he is a dog what has more energy and keeps
[54:05.240 --> 54:09.040]  going and going and going and going and it's committed if you call Trump anything he's
[54:09.040 --> 54:16.120]  dogged but that's my biggest compliment is that man is is like a hound that man never
[54:16.120 --> 54:22.440]  stops that man's a sheepdog and that's it Trump loves people everybody I know that knows
[54:22.440 --> 54:26.560]  him for years and his employees and everybody as long as you're genuine or not a scumbag
[54:26.560 --> 54:33.440]  he will end up promoting you and trying to build but you cross Trump he then wants to
[54:33.440 --> 54:40.240]  bring you down and not out of some addictiveness but it's a non zero some game a non zero some
[54:40.240 --> 54:46.680]  game is a win-win I'm saying a zero some game but a non zero sub non zero some game
[54:46.680 --> 54:52.200]  I'm teleprompter free folks and I'm here just coming from the heart but absolutely a non
[54:52.200 --> 54:56.640]  zero some game a zero some game would be really have any numbers but I mean that's kind of
[54:56.640 --> 55:02.800]  what I'm saying a non zero some game is what I'm getting at a system where you transcend
[55:02.800 --> 55:09.000]  that the problem is all the utopia pushers tell you we'll let a giant central computer
[55:09.000 --> 55:13.120]  run our lives it'll tell us what we do who we are what we're going to be in our lives
[55:13.120 --> 55:17.840]  and it will dole out the resources and the average person who hasn't lived very much
[55:17.840 --> 55:22.920]  thinks oh that sounds great my mommy will divide the pizza up evenly no the ultimate
[55:22.920 --> 55:27.240]  hell on earth would be the zeitgeist movement with a central computer telling you what you
[55:27.240 --> 55:33.000]  do plus who programs the central computer that's a technocracy that's the system they're
[55:33.000 --> 55:38.520]  selling as a quote grassroots movement but that's why the New York Times and the UN
[55:38.520 --> 55:43.040]  endorsed it because it's such a horrible system and I was told by Peter Joseph in an interview
[55:43.040 --> 55:46.320]  like eight nine years ago he said you will be sent to a reeducation camp if you don't
[55:46.320 --> 55:50.080]  accept this and then he told everybody he never said that even though we have the interview
[55:50.080 --> 55:54.880]  where he says you'll be sent to a reeducation camp you'll be reeducated they will not ever
[55:54.880 --> 55:59.920]  be truthful with you and if they slip up they'll then deny it this is about them deciding
[55:59.920 --> 56:07.080]  your destiny Peter Joseph Noam Chomsky Hillary Clinton David Rockefeller the globalist it's
[56:07.080 --> 56:13.000]  about them being gods them arranging humans in the shapes and systems they want look at
[56:13.000 --> 56:23.360]  the North Korean displays I want a non-zero some game a non-zero some game a true 360
[56:23.360 --> 56:32.440]  win transcending the control arms can transcending the system which will never truly attain but
[56:32.440 --> 56:37.080]  one tenth of attaining it is heaven compared to what these globalists want to set up but
[56:37.080 --> 56:43.440]  let's show the dumb down throngs of desperate people drinking fluoride eating GMO their
[56:43.440 --> 56:48.280]  whole lives watching TV all day lifestyles the rich and famous making themselves feel
[56:48.280 --> 56:52.080]  inadequate because they can't ever attain something that doesn't even really exist and
[56:52.080 --> 56:55.720]  that those Hollywood people the most unhappy folks anywhere planning a garden loving their
[56:55.720 --> 57:01.200]  husband or wife going and helping people being involved building things enjoying themselves
[57:01.200 --> 57:06.240]  enjoying the beauty God gave us all of this would help them begin to transcend the ugly
[57:06.240 --> 57:15.280]  enemy that seeks to shutter our minds and force us into their matrix like fake TV land
[57:15.280 --> 57:32.320]  proto matrix let's go to that club no longer gonna be silent we're gonna take to the streets
[57:32.320 --> 57:48.240]  they're hate against gays and trans and people of color we're no longer gonna stand up like
[57:48.240 --> 57:51.960]  you can look at the change you can see it in Chicago you can see it in LA you can see
[57:51.960 --> 57:56.480]  it in New York we're no longer gonna sit and let anything just happen to us we have
[57:56.480 --> 58:03.120]  a voice and we're gonna we're gonna break but imagine folks they believe TV they believe
[58:03.120 --> 58:06.280]  the quotes that Donald Trump calls them stupid that he said things about Mexicans he never
[58:06.280 --> 58:12.120]  did all out of context they really have been filled full of race consciousness themselves
[58:12.120 --> 58:16.000]  totally hyped up with it and then there's a backlash against it and they want to say
[58:16.000 --> 58:22.720]  it's all white racism well the same white people voted in Barack Obama voted in Donald
[58:22.720 --> 58:30.040]  J. Trump and these folks don't want prosperity they their whole identity is being victims
[58:30.040 --> 58:35.280]  imagine how sad that is their identity the air they breathe is how they've been wrong

[01:08:33.560 --> 01:08:37.920]  guy for I don't know more than 10 years and we would have promote a lot of his artwork
[01:08:37.920 --> 01:08:42.880]  exposing the fake wars the republicans the democrats their their war mongering and I
[01:08:42.880 --> 01:08:46.560]  know he's been a someone of a supporter of Trump though he's been obviously attacked
[01:08:46.560 --> 01:08:50.800]  a lot demonized a lot and he ended up giving us a lot of intel about what left his groups
[01:08:50.800 --> 01:08:57.080]  and people were up to running false flags you name it in the last year against Trump
[01:08:57.080 --> 01:09:01.320]  I don't know how much that he can get into today but this is inside the east coast inside
[01:09:01.320 --> 01:09:07.480]  New York with a very popular top tier artist that does major magazine covers for the top
[01:09:07.480 --> 01:09:12.560]  magazines and publications in the country so we're gonna be coming on this show it takes
[01:09:12.560 --> 01:09:18.360]  a lot of courage because these people blackball they are anti free speech they are anti liberal
[01:09:18.360 --> 01:09:23.440]  they're very very very very very nasty and they are making a move against the American
[01:09:23.440 --> 01:09:28.480]  people but he has some issues with Trump so do I and I think one of them Snowden I said
[01:09:28.480 --> 01:09:35.040]  yesterday it was whistleblowers like Snowden and Bradley Manning and all the other things
[01:09:35.040 --> 01:09:43.080]  that happened that led the way for WikiLeaks and Julian Assange that led the way for and
[01:09:43.080 --> 01:09:46.720]  of course Assange came before that but it was just overall burgeoning of what we've
[01:09:46.720 --> 01:09:52.120]  seen and an explosion the last few years in people exposing things with the DC leaks
[01:09:52.120 --> 01:09:58.640]  and the latest leaks that went to WikiLeaks and so much more so if Trump got in mainly
[01:09:58.640 --> 01:10:04.000]  because of the whistleblowers exposing Clinton and this whole democratic republican corrupt
[01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:08.880]  apparatus that means the intelligence community the patriots across the world not just here
[01:10:08.880 --> 01:10:14.680]  in the US but mainly here in the US are gonna want to see real change or Trump will go
[01:10:14.680 --> 01:10:20.560]  the same way as the Clinton dynasty if he engages in the same type of activities I don't
[01:10:20.560 --> 01:10:25.160]  think Trump inherently will because he's not corrupt he's on a mastermind type he leads
[01:10:25.160 --> 01:10:30.640]  from the front not by stealth but still people are expecting that and so there's a few issues
[01:10:30.640 --> 01:10:35.240]  I have with Trump one of them is the fact that he's called Snowden a trader a few years
[01:10:35.240 --> 01:10:39.640]  ago and I get the idea you're you know you're taking classified information out you could
[01:10:39.640 --> 01:10:44.320]  hurt the country but what if the information is criminal what if it shows a breakaway state
[01:10:44.320 --> 01:10:51.680]  but just clearly doing things that are against the people we owe Snowden we owe Julian Assange
[01:10:51.680 --> 01:10:57.760]  we owe Chelsea Manning we owe all these men and women an incredible debt of gratitude
[01:10:57.760 --> 01:11:02.760]  they're heroes now I understand that if you if people don't get punished for giving out
[01:11:02.760 --> 01:11:08.240]  classified information then folks will start selling it well Hillary got caught doing
[01:11:08.240 --> 01:11:13.680]  that to the Russians and the Chinese and everybody else then blaming Trump for that
[01:11:13.680 --> 01:11:18.960]  so so think about that long and hard if we don't prosecute people that really do sell
[01:11:18.960 --> 01:11:24.760]  out our sovereignty but then go after whistleblowers that are defending our sovereignty and the
[01:11:24.760 --> 01:11:31.000]  health of our nation it's a fraud so I'll give Trump this this is what the former head
[01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:36.000]  of the NSA technical has said William Binney on the show yes Snowden might get a small
[01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:42.400]  charge but everybody else needs to be charged as well and so until you do that you can't
[01:11:42.400 --> 01:11:46.920]  so I think we point out that if you're exposing serious crimes you should go to Congress first
[01:11:46.920 --> 01:11:49.800]  but if they don't act you have a right and responsibility to expose it but the whole
[01:11:49.800 --> 01:11:54.200]  criminal state doesn't want that so I think the most important part of this ongoing revolution
[01:11:54.200 --> 01:11:58.800]  against tyranny is that we kept calling for good people in government to stand up and
[01:11:58.800 --> 01:12:04.480]  do what was right well they did that's why George Soros and I was to try to start a war
[01:12:04.480 --> 01:12:09.800]  within the government and a war with the people of civil war is to distract from Americans
[01:12:09.800 --> 01:12:17.040]  of every race color and creed government non-government coming together to expose corruption wherever
[01:12:17.040 --> 01:12:21.880]  you find it so the real heroes the last few years are the hackers the white hat hackers
[01:12:21.880 --> 01:12:27.560]  they are the Stotens they are the Assange's they are the Chelsea Manning's they are the
[01:12:27.560 --> 01:12:32.040]  DC leaks folks they're the poor man they got shot four times in the back and basically
[01:12:32.040 --> 01:12:37.320]  said that was their source these are the heroes and then from that point you have the dissident
[01:12:37.320 --> 01:12:41.400]  artist and people that I would call real classical liberals I think it's fair to call Anthony
[01:12:41.400 --> 01:12:47.520]  free to that very talented artist who sees the illiberal tyrannical activities of Democrats
[01:12:47.520 --> 01:12:52.280]  working with the Republicans and who has had the will to come out against it to a lot of
[01:12:52.280 --> 01:12:57.840]  attacks now think about we're such a free country and the left so open and inclusive
[01:12:57.840 --> 01:13:02.200]  but he can't do that without being persecuted that's because the left has died in this country
[01:13:02.200 --> 01:13:08.680]  and they've created a cult that serves tyranny we're seeing populism through the Tea Party
[01:13:08.680 --> 01:13:12.520]  that got so demonized that isn't racist on average that I told you was the best shot
[01:13:12.520 --> 01:13:16.400]  we had to take the country back I told you years ago they're putting all their money
[01:13:16.400 --> 01:13:22.300]  Republicans and Democrats in the establishment into stopping a Tea Party insurrection of
[01:13:22.300 --> 01:13:28.440]  libertarian populism through the Republican Party that at least in some of their planks
[01:13:28.440 --> 01:13:33.120]  is more Americana that's now happened will Trump deliver that's up to him that's up
[01:13:33.120 --> 01:13:38.600]  to us holding his feet to the fire but regardless a huge repudiation of MSM and all their lives
[01:13:38.600 --> 01:13:44.120]  a huge repudiation of the of the pollsters a huge repudiation of the stonewalling of
[01:13:44.120 --> 01:13:47.720]  the New York Times and the Washington Post and others about the fact that Obama cares
[01:13:47.720 --> 01:13:52.360]  a ripoff written by insurance companies to scam us the fact that our borders are wide
[01:13:52.360 --> 01:13:56.640]  open and we're creating a permanent underclass and driving down wages the fact that it's
[01:13:56.640 --> 01:14:01.400]  not racist to make immigrants come here legally every other country does it the fact that we're
[01:14:01.400 --> 01:14:08.800]  sick as Americans people either stood by and were neutral in 2008 as I was because McCain
[01:14:08.800 --> 01:14:15.880]  was so bad or folks that voted for Obama because they wanted to repudiate Bush you don't now
[01:14:15.880 --> 01:14:20.960]  call those people racist and call it a white lash so the Michael Moore's credit he has
[01:14:20.960 --> 01:14:25.760]  said this was not about racism he lately has changed his tune because he knows no one's
[01:14:25.760 --> 01:14:30.240]  buying it he wants to remain popular to promote his new movie he went out three weeks ago and
[01:14:30.240 --> 01:14:36.400]  said Trump's probably gonna win and he has a lot of good points because they understand
[01:14:36.400 --> 01:14:43.200]  folks there in a crisis mode so what are they doing a week after the election they are intensifying
[01:14:43.200 --> 01:14:47.440]  what failed they're digging their hole deeper they are saying globalism doesn't exist much
[01:14:47.440 --> 01:14:52.560]  less world government and next hour we have a piece five minutes long now of world leaders
[01:14:52.560 --> 01:15:00.360]  including Obama calling for global government saying give up our sovereignty give up our
[01:15:00.360 --> 01:15:05.320]  freedom of action that's like a man grabbing a kid out of a school yard putting handcuffs
[01:15:05.320 --> 01:15:10.600]  on him and saying let me bind your feet don't fight it'll all be okay that's when you find
[01:15:10.600 --> 01:15:17.360]  yourself in a basement with a blowtorch okay so this is classic serial killer stuff but
[01:15:17.360 --> 01:15:23.160]  to the whole culture so before we go to freedom here's Obama in September at the UN saying
[01:15:23.160 --> 01:15:28.960]  give up our sovereignty here it is and we can only realize the promise of this institution's
[01:15:28.960 --> 01:15:37.040]  founding to replace the ravages of war with cooperation if powerful nations like my own
[01:15:37.040 --> 01:15:47.080]  accept constraints sometimes I'm criticized in my own country for professing a belief
[01:15:47.080 --> 01:15:53.200]  in international norms and multilateral institutions but I am convinced that in the long run giving
[01:15:53.200 --> 01:16:00.480]  up some freedom of action not giving up our ability to protect ourselves or pursue our
[01:16:00.480 --> 01:16:08.400]  core interests but binding ourselves to international rules over the long term enhances our security
[01:16:08.400 --> 01:16:16.200]  so who makes those rules private corporations and secret boards the TPP is burning down
[01:16:16.200 --> 01:16:20.280]  the carbon tax is about to be removed these are huge victories world war three has been
[01:16:20.280 --> 01:16:26.360]  averted death con nuclear threat reduced the safest level following Donald Trump victory
[01:16:26.360 --> 01:16:30.680]  that's out of the express news in England Trump and Putin talked yesterday and said
[01:16:30.680 --> 01:16:39.400]  they want to work together to deescalate military confrontations and work to stop ISIS well
[01:16:39.400 --> 01:16:45.640]  that sounds like they taught to me that sounds like classical liberal to me we're joined by
[01:16:45.640 --> 01:16:51.040]  Anthony Frida Anthony Frida dot com I'm gonna go over his old bio but he's one of the top
[01:16:51.040 --> 01:16:54.800]  illustrators of the country for everything from Rolling Stone Newark magazine and he
[01:16:54.800 --> 01:16:59.200]  is here joining us now I don't know how much you can get into what you saw behind the scenes
[01:16:59.200 --> 01:17:03.520]  in the art world but I know you gave us some of that off the record pretty shocking information
[01:17:03.520 --> 01:17:10.480]  where do you want to start my friend well I think you know the fact that you have been
[01:17:10.480 --> 01:17:16.440]  consistent I started listening to you during the Bush era and you held Obama to the same
[01:17:16.440 --> 01:17:22.920]  standard you held Bush to so that to me gives you credibility that and an objectivity that
[01:17:22.920 --> 01:17:29.720]  almost nobody has I mean except you everybody seems to you know get into this tribal mentality
[01:17:29.720 --> 01:17:34.760]  where there's just hypocrisy on both sides and hypocrisy everywhere it's an hypocrisy
[01:17:34.760 --> 01:17:40.760]  nation we become but I know you've been you remain consistent and and I hope and I and
[01:17:40.760 --> 01:17:46.480]  I I believe you will hold Trump to the same standard you know his predecessors to and I
[01:17:46.480 --> 01:17:51.080]  will I know you will and that that'll give you credit even further credibility the matter
[01:17:51.080 --> 01:17:58.360]  what you know listen I get a lot of stuff a lot of crap for defending you but that's
[01:17:58.360 --> 01:18:05.240]  because I've seen you in your entirety over you know decade so I can judge you I think
[01:18:05.240 --> 01:18:10.800]  objectively and you remain consistent your anti-war your full freedom your pro-liberty
[01:18:10.800 --> 01:18:17.320]  your pro-constitution and that's supposed to be what what the left is you know so to
[01:18:17.320 --> 01:18:24.880]  me that is very interesting with this nexus where real progressive anti-war pro-civil-liberty
[01:18:24.880 --> 01:18:30.560]  liberals meet the libertarians that nexus is where I live that little world is interesting
[01:18:30.560 --> 01:18:36.720]  because um it's a non-interventionist policy like Ron Paul talks about but I think I think
[01:18:36.720 --> 01:18:42.080]  the biggest problem we face now is is like you talk about this tribalism I mean my god
[01:18:42.080 --> 01:18:47.320]  is taking this it's gone to extremes like people hated Bush on the left but I mean they
[01:18:47.320 --> 01:18:51.080]  want to murder Trump they didn't want to murder Bush they just you know I thought he was like
[01:18:51.080 --> 01:18:55.680]  this fool or this idiot that they could make fun of but they didn't they didn't despise
[01:18:55.680 --> 01:19:04.360]  him like like I feel now I see now so it's recent dangerous level that I think threatens
[01:19:04.360 --> 01:19:09.160]  you know any stability in this country I agree and then you look at who's behind them people
[01:19:09.160 --> 01:19:13.040]  like George Soros he's about as opposite of liberal as you can get I mean admittedly
[01:19:13.040 --> 01:19:19.200]  overthrows countries he stabilizes completely amoral started off as a Nazi collaborator
[01:19:19.200 --> 01:19:24.880]  I mean who can make this up yeah he's a lot less uh yeah and I think a lot of people don't
[01:19:24.880 --> 01:19:30.080]  know that so what I try to do is try to bridge gaps between the whatever you want to call
[01:19:30.080 --> 01:19:35.280]  the old right media and the old left media or their mainstream media because I think
[01:19:35.280 --> 01:19:40.200]  that you know we're in these little echo chambers where people who listen to Breitbart
[01:19:40.200 --> 01:19:45.360]  or you are in their little echo chamber and then people who listen to media matters at
[01:19:45.360 --> 01:19:49.720]  MSNBC or in their echo chambers I tell you what Anthony Frida let's talk about how do
[01:19:49.720 --> 01:19:52.680]  we get out of the echo chamber because I'd love to do that I was talking the New York

[01:23:57.240 --> 01:24:08.480]  now we've got william after jasper the editor at the new american magazine the oldest organization
[01:24:08.480 --> 01:24:12.520]  in the country john bursa society fighting the globalist for 60 years they're called
[01:24:12.520 --> 01:24:17.080]  racist every other name with zero proof just like they're calling myself racist or calling
[01:24:17.080 --> 01:24:22.120]  steven bannon the chief counselor to trump racist with zero evidence they just keep throwing
[01:24:22.120 --> 01:24:26.960]  it out there where it doesn't hurt people anymore the problem is we're not real racist
[01:24:26.960 --> 01:24:33.920]  then now they get a free pass so there is a rise of more white racists now because people
[01:24:33.920 --> 01:24:38.880]  are sick of being called racist by racist blacks racist Hispanics and others that's why so we
[01:24:38.880 --> 01:24:42.320]  got to get out of this echo chamber because man you go out of these anti-trump rallies
[01:24:42.320 --> 01:24:48.320]  it is the most anti-white thing and they somehow see america as white even though Hispanics
[01:24:48.320 --> 01:24:53.440]  are about to be in like 15 years 70% of the country they're already basically half it's
[01:24:53.440 --> 01:24:57.320]  your country now most Hispanics just want a future and a job and are very compatible
[01:24:57.320 --> 01:25:01.520]  with americana ideas but there's an attempt by the social engineers but everybody in this
[01:25:01.520 --> 01:25:07.840]  tribalism that anthony frida one of the top editorial cartoonist graphic artist painters
[01:25:07.840 --> 01:25:13.260]  in the country is warning about it he's desperately trying to get hillary defines this as this
[01:25:13.260 --> 01:25:19.560]  the alt right i just call us the new media that's that's americana and free market with
[01:25:19.560 --> 01:25:24.160]  the alt left but all i call us is people that are off the reservation aren't buying
[01:25:24.160 --> 01:25:28.160]  into this and the same folks that voted in obama desperately hitting the panic button
[01:25:28.160 --> 01:25:32.320]  are now voting in trump and if he doesn't deliver he'll be anathema because folks are
[01:25:32.320 --> 01:25:36.480]  in love with trump record numbers of blacks record numbers of hispanics broke the matrix
[01:25:36.480 --> 01:25:39.960]  and voted for him anthony though great point we're showing some of your amazing art for
[01:25:39.960 --> 01:25:44.240]  folks that are watching on tv in full wars dot com four slash show your radio listener
[01:25:44.240 --> 01:25:47.520]  to find the feeds one of the best probably the best artists out there when it comes down
[01:25:47.520 --> 01:25:52.520]  to it i gotta say his art is hanging up all over our office anthony this is a short segment
[01:25:52.520 --> 01:25:56.280]  long segment coming up but getting into that echo chamber how do you break people out of
[01:25:56.280 --> 01:26:00.320]  the cognitive dissonance because i'm ready to hear a leftist tell me their views they're
[01:26:00.320 --> 01:26:06.000]  not really leftist today now they will never even talk to our reporters they just absolutely
[01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:10.720]  just scream incoherently and and and just scream you're a racist you're a homophobe
[01:26:10.720 --> 01:26:15.080]  if you tell them donald trump was a trailblazer of actual gay rights and that some conservatives
[01:26:15.080 --> 01:26:20.560]  criticizing for that they get even more mad that just they're so dedicated to the twist
[01:26:20.560 --> 01:26:26.560]  a twisted information yeah well it's a tale of two countries right i mean this demonization
[01:26:26.560 --> 01:26:32.120]  campaign has been incredibly successful but at the same time it's failed because donald
[01:26:32.120 --> 01:26:40.120]  trump is president so this concerted uh unprecedented demonize dehumanization and demonization campaign
[01:26:40.120 --> 01:26:48.400]  against donald trump from every quarter the the media and hillary nonstop ads uh demonizing
[01:26:48.400 --> 01:26:57.280]  him and i went to a magazine store um in new york city a couple months ago and every
[01:26:57.280 --> 01:27:04.120]  cover as i looked up to this magazine stand was either he was hitler or he was the kkk
[01:27:04.120 --> 01:27:08.840]  and he's done by illustrators or designers that i know personally and every single one
[01:27:08.840 --> 01:27:14.040]  was like he it was so extreme hope so over the top so there's a thing called godwin's
[01:27:14.040 --> 01:27:19.720]  law once you compare your adversary to hitler you lost the argument because it's ridiculous
[01:27:19.720 --> 01:27:23.240]  he's not hitler okay you know you can have your problems with trump i have problems
[01:27:23.240 --> 01:27:27.720]  with trump the guy is not freaking hitler okay you gotta get that out of your mind my
[01:27:27.720 --> 01:27:33.360]  own mother who i love dearly um she was a big hillary person because she wanted to see
[01:27:33.360 --> 01:27:39.200]  a woman president uh and she hated trump because she watches the view she watches msnbc and
[01:27:39.200 --> 01:27:45.000]  just this concerted demonization dehumanizing campaign over the last year has convinced
[01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:49.600]  her that he is the worst human being on earth and it's almost impossible there's nothing
[01:27:49.600 --> 01:27:54.720]  i could do to um to convince her otherwise i mean no matter how much evidence i've presented
[01:27:54.720 --> 01:28:01.080]  to contrary you know she's been presented with this onslaught i mean a daily onslaught
[01:28:01.080 --> 01:28:05.400]  i talk about the two minutes of hate it is literally out of the playbook from 1984 where
[01:28:05.400 --> 01:28:11.760]  um you you know you project everything you hate about the world onto this one person
[01:28:11.760 --> 01:28:17.120]  and then you could do anything to him or his followers and feel morally justified because
[01:28:17.120 --> 01:28:21.840]  he's evil he is the he is the poster boy for evil that is actually a nazi tactic but what
[01:28:21.840 --> 01:28:25.320]  i mean what's funny is you could compare hillary actually to hitler there's few people you
[01:28:25.320 --> 01:28:30.480]  can that are actually that bad but she actually warmongering lying into killing throwing fits
[01:28:30.480 --> 01:28:34.200]  she reportedly on election night i was told this by insiders now it's confirmed sort of
[01:28:34.200 --> 01:28:38.360]  physically attacking people hitler would do that i mean she's a lot closer to hitler than
[01:28:38.360 --> 01:28:43.520]  doll trump you can make a better case dude trump hasn't killed anybody who does he kill
[01:28:43.520 --> 01:28:49.520]  i mean even even if you make the extreme argument that you know he wants to uh keep muslim immigration
[01:28:49.520 --> 01:28:54.440]  from happening hillary wants to murder the muslim so which is worse so if you if you
[01:28:54.440 --> 01:29:00.640]  try to defend muslims uh you know he wants to restrict the immigration to prevent um
[01:29:00.640 --> 01:29:05.000]  listen if he stops isis that will save hundreds of thousands about millions of muslims that's
[01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:10.000]  the main grip they're killing they're the radical extreme ultra right wing crazies so
[01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:14.680]  why is she allied with them well everything is upside down because i mean you think about
[01:29:14.680 --> 01:29:19.920]  that that that alliance between the left and radical or islam is odd to me because you
[01:29:19.920 --> 01:29:26.000]  know they promote um transgenderism and homosexuality which is which is fine i have no problem
[01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:31.040]  with that but then to embrace islam which is i mean imagine what a transgender guy would
[01:29:31.040 --> 01:29:34.600]  get it stay there let's come back with that exactly and that's what pisses people off
[01:29:34.600 --> 01:29:40.080]  that her thinkers is that it's just upside down i mean she her girlfriend is umma abadine
[01:29:40.080 --> 01:29:44.240]  whose mother is the top pusher of cutting little girl's genitals off it's like and then
[01:29:44.240 --> 01:29:49.440]  they're into satanism they're a bunch of freaks folks we'll be back with anthony frida we're
[01:29:49.440 --> 01:30:00.960]  on the march the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network report hillary became
[01:30:00.960 --> 01:30:04.880]  physically violent after she realized she had lost the election clinton had to be briefly
[01:30:04.880 --> 01:30:09.400]  restrained after trying to attack her own campaign staff article by paul joseph watson
[01:30:09.400 --> 01:30:13.840]  seeing a reporter tells me hillary became physically violent towards robbie mook and john pedessa
[01:30:13.840 --> 01:30:17.880]  around midnight had to be briefly restrained it was pedestrian who was sent out to talk
[01:30:17.880 --> 01:30:21.880]  to hillary's dejected supporter shortly before hillary called donald trump to concede with
[01:30:21.880 --> 01:30:25.880]  clinton nowhere to be seen until the following day when asked about rumors that hillary was
[01:30:25.880 --> 01:30:30.400]  drunk on election night concanon responded she was i posted about that too she was in
[01:30:30.400 --> 01:30:36.560]  a psychotic drunken rage according to my reporter friend doctor added sedatives to the mix concanon
[01:30:36.560 --> 01:30:40.680]  then claimed that cnn blocked a reporter from publishing what would have been a bombshell
[01:30:40.680 --> 01:30:45.840]  story the cnn reporter didn't fail to report it his editors will not let him cnn has banned
[01:30:45.840 --> 01:30:50.360]  all hillary in the bunker stories he tweeted secret service officials and other staff

[01:33:28.760 --> 01:33:33.680]  bit into it but behind the scenes with the top liberal illustrators the stuff he saw
[01:33:33.680 --> 01:33:38.800]  the stuff he heard concerning myself donald trump you name it and and things that he told
[01:33:38.800 --> 01:33:45.320]  us we then encountered and it's it's really really dirty tricks folks putting racist stuff
[01:33:45.320 --> 01:33:49.520]  out saying we did it things like that and we're seeing a lot more of this starting to come
[01:33:49.520 --> 01:33:53.440]  out and start happening so this guy's a lot of courage i've always told him so he doesn't
[01:33:53.440 --> 01:33:57.640]  get blackballed he should just direct sell his great posters and material which he does
[01:33:57.640 --> 01:34:03.200]  and you can find all that on his website entity free to dot com it's amongst the best out
[01:34:03.200 --> 01:34:09.080]  there incredibly prolific it's just ridiculous how good it all is back sometime i know he's

[01:34:13.640 --> 01:34:17.880]  sometime i'm just saying all this on air because it's it's so amazing this is the type of stuff
[01:34:17.880 --> 01:34:25.560]  you want on your walls and on your coffee table at your business you name it because it's
[01:34:25.560 --> 01:34:30.680]  transcendent it's very very bipartisan he doesn't be plugging his art here but i am
[01:34:30.680 --> 01:34:35.520]  because it speaks to everyone the humanity in us and brings us together which spoken
[01:34:35.520 --> 01:34:39.720]  word is hard to do we're going back to freedom here in a moment i wanted to mention this we
[01:34:39.720 --> 01:34:44.840]  have fox news cnn ms mbc on in the control room monitoring it rush after a three week
[01:34:44.840 --> 01:34:52.120]  ceasefire which the al-qaeda folks that's ices broke they have resumed strikes and so this
[01:34:52.120 --> 01:34:55.840]  is a very very serious war the issue is the west started at five years ago hillary started
[01:34:55.840 --> 01:35:01.520]  at five years ago john carrey started at five years ago and that's why they're the ones
[01:35:01.520 --> 01:35:05.480]  that basically take the blame for it they keep saying Assad not stepping down is what
[01:35:05.480 --> 01:35:10.320]  did it he's ready to step down when al-qaeda and ices pull out and then they'll have elections
[01:35:10.320 --> 01:35:14.840]  he wants to leave he's he's he grew up in england he doesn't want to be in this but but al-qaeda
[01:35:14.840 --> 01:35:18.840]  is going to force the sunnis that aren't part of their group the shiites and aren't part
[01:35:18.840 --> 01:35:22.480]  of it the alawites the christians that are left to convert the most radical forms of
[01:35:22.480 --> 01:35:28.000]  islam they make people eat dead bodies they eat hearts they they they just do they throw
[01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:33.120]  people off bridges they throw gays off buildings they they murder catholic priests why does anyone
[01:35:33.120 --> 01:35:37.480]  put up with this and this is who our government's pushing and now saying trump's going to cause
[01:35:37.480 --> 01:35:44.960]  world war three after defense condition nuclear threat reduced the safest and lowest level
[01:35:44.960 --> 01:35:52.000]  following trump victory trump and putin we will destroy ices if trump brings his promises
[01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:56.360]  alive it will radically change the situation you can read this on info wars dot com the
[01:35:56.360 --> 01:36:00.000]  full transcript of their conversation trump without a transcript the russians without
[01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:04.560]  a transcript it's the same conversation trump is very very sophisticated already doing that's
[01:36:04.560 --> 01:36:08.280]  the media can't spin what he said or did he just said you know we're with the russian
[01:36:08.280 --> 01:36:14.000]  people we're with you know russia we we look forward to a good relationship bilateral ties
[01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:20.800]  taking out radical islam together a constructive cooperation russia doesn't control hollywood
[01:36:20.800 --> 01:36:25.000]  like china does now it's been announced i told you first five years ago i mean i knew every
[01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:30.720]  movie china's the hero every movie i go see that's an action adventure or sci-fi movie
[01:36:30.720 --> 01:36:35.520]  just every one i mean anyone i want to see a arrival it'd be the chinese save course
[01:36:35.520 --> 01:36:40.560]  they did every every movie every movie they have final cut down all the major films they're
[01:36:40.560 --> 01:36:44.760]  buying up the final six production houses this is the communist chinese folks the biggest
[01:36:44.760 --> 01:36:51.520]  murders in history so the point is russia has two and a half bases two main bases a little
[01:36:51.520 --> 01:36:58.000]  sub base we have thousands they're not invading anybody they're not it's the west under cheney
[01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:04.120]  and 2008 and now under obama that is starting a war with russia and russia needs to be stabilized
[01:37:04.120 --> 01:37:07.080]  i don't want war with china either i want to see china free but china has been given
[01:37:07.080 --> 01:37:12.160]  all the rare earth minerals all the major ports the panamaka now they're taking over
[01:37:12.160 --> 01:37:16.160]  okay because the globalists made a deal with them the globalists are allied against all
[01:37:16.160 --> 01:37:23.160]  sovereign nations with china against the world that includes india it includes everybody
[01:37:23.160 --> 01:37:27.360]  okay so you need to understand that hollywood is completely sold out to it the chinese government
[01:37:27.360 --> 01:37:32.240]  rags about it how pathetic we are it's it's it's sick people say how did you know this
[01:37:32.240 --> 01:37:36.240]  first five years ago they started telling what movies could come out like red dawn to
[01:37:36.240 --> 01:37:40.000]  they had to re-edit take china out of it i mean and then i talk to people hollywood
[01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:44.040]  they said listen most of our stuff's financed by china now we're really going bankrupt they're
[01:37:44.040 --> 01:37:46.600]  just funneling tens of billions there was going to be hundreds of billions next year
[01:37:46.600 --> 01:37:50.680]  i mean i've sat there with the top lawyers of hollywood okay because you least want me
[01:37:50.680 --> 01:37:54.800]  to do projects with them it's all a total waste of time but i'd be out there every month
[01:37:54.800 --> 01:37:58.840]  dealing with these people and it's just a joke and really what it was dangling movie roles
[01:37:58.840 --> 01:38:03.640]  in front of me if i just shut up what's your stupid movies in fact i've licensed i'm not
[01:38:03.640 --> 01:38:06.480]  bragging this show to a bunch of big movies so you want to use a clip the show go ahead

[01:38:10.080 --> 01:38:15.920]  point is is that we're winning the culture war as true libertarian patriots the globalists

[01:40:37.160 --> 01:40:41.640]  this facility here in austin texas that has a lot of hollywood folks here they told me
[01:40:41.640 --> 01:40:46.040]  they said listen we came and put your lights in we came and put up your green screen and

[01:41:03.440 --> 01:41:09.600]  are bad just try the cult of the fascist liberals they mean business and they've told me that

[01:41:19.120 --> 01:41:24.760]  and where else so we used to get 20 million and we thought that was really great so thank
[01:41:24.760 --> 01:41:29.600]  god i'm not with the new york times msnbc and robert rodriguez with his tv empire propped
[01:41:29.600 --> 01:41:34.280]  up by the government so uh you failed again you're a joke i'm sorry that's just the facts
[01:41:34.280 --> 01:41:40.080]  now going back to anthony frida finishing up with islam and the super orthodox radical
[01:41:40.080 --> 01:41:44.920]  form of it via a hobbyism was taking over when you talk to your leftist friends about
[01:41:44.920 --> 01:41:50.480]  this you told me you have how do they juxtapose these rallies saying donald trump's a homophobe
[01:41:50.480 --> 01:41:54.400]  and screaming and yelling he wants to you know kill mexicans or whatever while there's
[01:41:54.400 --> 01:42:00.840]  women in hajibs or full burkas basically on leashes there with their husbands running
[01:42:00.840 --> 01:42:06.600]  around scrambling around i mean how do they how do they juxtapose this anthony frida it's
[01:42:06.600 --> 01:42:11.480]  a mystery to me i mean i i'm against all tyranny and there are tyrannical systems that have
[01:42:11.480 --> 01:42:18.080]  been codified into into you know uh can or 11 muslim countries where i mean women are
[01:42:18.080 --> 01:42:24.120]  treated like slaves homosexuals are murdered okay yeah and they say that donald trump
[01:42:24.120 --> 01:42:28.240]  is a homophobe i mean give me a break but what do you ever do to gay people what and
[01:42:28.240 --> 01:42:32.400]  what do you more importantly what do you think he's going to do to gay people once he's elected
[01:42:32.400 --> 01:42:39.040]  nothing it's ridiculous it's it's it's based on this hysteria and these are smart people
[01:42:39.040 --> 01:42:44.760]  but they've bought into this this narrative that he is the epitome of evil and all evil
[01:42:44.760 --> 01:42:52.080]  in the world is projected onto him and uh in some bizarre way the uh goodness has been
[01:42:52.080 --> 01:42:57.480]  projected onto hillary which is just it is just that i was with reality and um i try
[01:42:57.480 --> 01:43:01.960]  to be objective and i know you do too and that's what i respect objectivity but partisanship
[01:43:01.960 --> 01:43:08.320]  is anathema to objectivity so what happens is people project all the ills of of the world
[01:43:08.320 --> 01:43:17.440]  and all their own uh failures and fears onto their uh enemy and they discord any evidence
[01:43:17.440 --> 01:43:23.760]  to the contrary so this is this is the element of tribalism which is um still this intractable
[01:43:23.760 --> 01:43:27.440]  problem that i i don't know how i don't know how we overcome it as a species i think it's
[01:43:27.440 --> 01:43:32.920]  our Achilles is healed as a species because i think at one point it was um you know it
[01:43:32.920 --> 01:43:38.440]  was a critical survival instinct but now it's become an impediment and maybe an existential
[01:43:38.440 --> 01:43:46.160]  threat to the our civilization and our culture and any advancement or hope for enlightenment
[01:43:46.160 --> 01:43:52.000]  as a species so we have to overcome that but it's built into our dna we're good they're
[01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:59.560]  bad so the people who hate uh trump have been just brutally and viciously uh assaulted
[01:43:59.560 --> 01:44:05.840]  with with the demonization campaign and uh he hates muslims he hates gays he hates trans
[01:44:05.840 --> 01:44:10.840]  he hates he hates everybody right give me a guy this gives the same guy i tried to my
[01:44:10.840 --> 01:44:16.480]  mother you know who i love this is the same guy you know who was a democrat in new york
[01:44:16.480 --> 01:44:21.000]  same guy from you know the apprentice the same guy all of a sudden in two years he became
[01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:26.480]  like it learned how did that happen it didn't happen well their new thing is to take the
[01:44:26.480 --> 01:44:30.120]  fake stuff they claim he stood for and now that he's not doing that they're claiming
[01:44:30.120 --> 01:44:33.560]  he's flip-flopping is trying to take out his base that's the latest attack but then when
[01:44:33.560 --> 01:44:37.000]  you go look at what he actually said this is exactly what he always said we're gonna get
[01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:43.560]  rid of the mandate we're gonna get rid of making you go out and get this but we're going
[01:44:43.560 --> 01:44:48.720]  to make the corporations uh that are making all this money cover pre-existing conditions
[01:44:48.720 --> 01:44:53.120]  and sure it's a good idea for people 26 years old who are in college or whatever to be able
[01:44:53.120 --> 01:44:58.760]  to stay on their parents insurance so because he is for a couple of good parts they're now
[01:44:58.760 --> 01:45:03.800]  saying he's lying and and isn't gonna actually get rid of obama care i mean they're just
[01:45:03.800 --> 01:45:08.040]  so deceptive well yeah and that's what's surprising that's the one thing to surprise
[01:45:08.040 --> 01:45:14.200]  me that their doesn't that their attack plan on donald trump backfired he's gonna be president
[01:45:14.200 --> 01:45:18.760]  all right it didn't work but they're doubling down on it so that's kind of shocking to me
[01:45:18.760 --> 01:45:24.080]  that's my next question i mean the new york times the washington post cnn msnbc they're
[01:45:24.080 --> 01:45:29.000]  not stopping they're getting worse than ever and so in a black crowd of racist thugs beat
[01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:32.240]  up a white guy because he's a trump supporter and a congressman brings it up a plate in
[01:45:32.240 --> 01:45:37.440]  a minute they say oh that wasn't racial well of course it's racial imagine a bunch of white
[01:45:37.440 --> 01:45:43.440]  people beat up a democrat supporter that was black they'd say it was racial the media acts
[01:45:43.440 --> 01:45:49.920]  like everybody isn't on the internet and doesn't know cnn's covering that up they don't i don't
[01:45:49.920 --> 01:45:54.200]  get why they're so arrogant if i was doing as bad as they were if i had an audience at
[01:45:54.200 --> 01:45:59.040]  average size of a hundred thousand i would realize what i'm saying has been rejected
[01:45:59.040 --> 01:46:02.800]  now i say what i believe in what's common sense so obviously that's why it's popular
[01:46:02.800 --> 01:46:07.520]  and i don't tailor my message but they claim they want ratings they call no no no they're
[01:46:07.520 --> 01:46:13.640]  only further digging their hole burning themselves up and self emulation so here's my question
[01:46:13.640 --> 01:46:19.120]  well how far does it go where do they end up because unless they shut us down they have
[01:46:19.120 --> 01:46:23.760]  no future i mean because they can't operate in this pure deception mode while there's
[01:46:23.760 --> 01:46:28.600]  other people there to call them out on it but here's the deal they're already so hated
[01:46:28.600 --> 01:46:33.240]  except by small pools of idiots that buy their lives you know that run around you know acting
[01:46:33.240 --> 01:46:38.960]  like idiots that even if they took us off the air the damage is already done nationalism
[01:46:38.960 --> 01:46:44.400]  against globalism is rising anthony yeah well it's hard to see where this is going to go
[01:46:44.400 --> 01:46:50.080]  out because um how's it going to wind up because yes at one point they have failed they're
[01:46:50.080 --> 01:46:54.280]  uh like i said Donald Trump's going to be elected even though there's this massive concerted
[01:46:54.280 --> 01:47:00.680]  campaign to dehumanize him and destroy him fail it failed but half the country still thinks
[01:47:00.680 --> 01:47:07.520]  he's Hitler right and also it was effective in that sense and they still listen i want
[01:47:07.520 --> 01:47:11.720]  to mention me to die they they've just failed us in every sense they've lied us into the
[01:47:11.720 --> 01:47:18.440]  iraq war they've lied us into to the libyan war they they have so much blood on their
[01:47:18.440 --> 01:47:24.560]  hands and what's disgraceful to me is that they are the the temerity to attack you they
[01:47:24.560 --> 01:47:29.520]  have blood on their hands they they are they are guilty of crimes against humanity oh yeah
[01:47:29.520 --> 01:47:32.960]  that's the biggest thing they hated about trump they kept saying even in the debates
[01:47:32.960 --> 01:47:38.520]  first debate no you were not against the iraq war we produced four clips before the war
[01:47:38.520 --> 01:47:42.080]  of them saying i don't think it's a good idea but shouldn't do it they're probably not the
[01:47:42.080 --> 01:47:46.840]  folks that attacked us and then several clips while it was first happening trump was being
[01:47:46.840 --> 01:47:52.760]  criticized on cnn and we played the clips for me and then they just say no you were for
[01:47:52.760 --> 01:47:57.020]  the war because they all know they were for it bipartisanly they're discredited in one
[01:47:57.020 --> 01:48:01.240]  of his strongest suits they don't want to give it to him that's right and even more
[01:48:01.240 --> 01:48:06.360]  than that it's so hypocritical because this is the same media that lied the world lied
[01:48:06.360 --> 01:48:12.440]  to the world about the weapons of mass destruction and ties to al-qaida even though you and weapons
[01:48:12.440 --> 01:48:18.640]  better said it was untrue and and hillary promoted this war which was this is my biggest
[01:48:18.640 --> 01:48:26.080]  beef with her highness hillard that she promoted the iraq war every single lie she aggressively
[01:48:26.080 --> 01:48:31.760]  cheerly they were worse than bush they they they intensified even before bush got in the
[01:48:31.760 --> 01:48:35.800]  draconian sanctions that killed a half million kids and their secretary of state bragged
[01:48:35.800 --> 01:48:40.680]  about it on 60 minutes and on nbc i mean again next level evil speaking of the race
[01:48:40.680 --> 01:48:46.920]  painting here's a congressman he's on the air yesterday jack kingston with tapper so
[01:48:46.920 --> 01:48:52.160]  arrogant and he under showing footage of black races beating up a white trump supporter
[01:48:52.160 --> 01:48:57.320]  and then they say why would you bring up race when clearly it's a racial political attack
[01:48:57.320 --> 01:49:01.240]  when the whole discussion that they're on the show for 10 minutes before is about how
[01:49:01.240 --> 01:49:07.360]  trump supporters are attacking hispanics and blacks they have no footage of it here's real
[01:49:07.360 --> 01:49:15.080]  footage and their response is to say that he's being racist total inversion of reality
[01:49:15.080 --> 01:49:20.040]  here it is and congressman kingston i know you want to talk about this as well well i
[01:49:20.040 --> 01:49:24.560]  just wanted to remind everybody that the only headquarters that was a tacker in the campaign
[01:49:24.560 --> 01:49:29.760]  was a republican headquarters in north carolina um the only people who've been arrested to
[01:49:29.760 --> 01:49:37.320]  my knowledge of 71 protesters in portland oregon um we know in chicago for example that a a
[01:49:37.320 --> 01:49:44.240]  white trump voter was beat up by african-american men and we also know why is it why does it
[01:49:44.240 --> 01:49:48.440]  matter that the race of the race of the people that beat him up because that's what the topic
[01:49:48.440 --> 01:49:54.600]  is here um just quote xenophobia homophobia racist and sexist that's what we we talked
[01:49:54.600 --> 01:49:57.800]  about in the last hour i have to say a trump voter was beaten up i don't know why you mentioned
[01:49:57.800 --> 01:50:02.240]  the race because i didn't bring it up you guys brought it up this incident chicago and
[01:50:02.240 --> 01:50:08.800]  yes and that's enough that's enough again anthony frida anthony frida dot com this is
[01:50:08.800 --> 01:50:13.200]  just illustrative how they won't admit that they're the ones pushing race war and then
[01:50:13.200 --> 01:50:16.720]  they just make it up the trump supporters are doing all this stuff but they don't understand
[01:50:16.720 --> 01:50:21.440]  the internet is there a hundred times bigger exposing them yeah well that's that's that
[01:50:21.440 --> 01:50:25.520]  means laughable the people obsessed on race 24 hours a day say how dare you bring up race
[01:50:25.520 --> 01:50:29.200]  you know say that's all you ever talk about let's get beyond this race let's not focus
[01:50:29.200 --> 01:50:33.840]  on race let's focus on policy let's focus on reality let's focus on what is the future
[01:50:33.840 --> 01:50:40.520]  of our country and um how can this new presidency change the course of the failed that's right
[01:50:40.520 --> 01:50:43.840]  let's talk about how trump wins then what does he really do if he cuts taxes for poor
[01:50:43.840 --> 01:50:47.600]  people it's a win if he doesn't have war with russia it's a win i mean if he gets rid of
[01:50:47.600 --> 01:50:52.280]  the tpp it's a win all that's already happening so trump is already delivering like no president
[01:50:52.280 --> 01:51:00.120]  ever seen if we support him early on he'll get a lot of good stuff done stay with us

[01:54:08.160 --> 01:54:13.520]  the globalism is using modern leftist tactics to infree speech and set up tyranny they'll use
[01:54:13.520 --> 01:54:18.560]  right wingers as well and what we're seeing trump do is appoint an anti-globalist like
[01:54:18.560 --> 01:54:22.800]  steven bannon who they're calling racist and a nazi and you know all this made up crap
[01:54:22.800 --> 01:54:28.240]  well knows the patriot and then they'll also appoint rents previs who's an establishment
[01:54:28.240 --> 01:54:32.320]  wonk who can kind of navigate things and i said this yesterday and it's being repeated now and
[01:54:32.320 --> 01:54:37.120]  that's what the exit campaign saying is you know trump and bannon steer the ship they give the
[01:54:37.120 --> 01:54:41.600]  orders and the guy at the wheel is is uh previs we'll see what happens but that's what trump
[01:54:41.600 --> 01:54:47.680]  does is he'll have both sides in his organization to try to control them all juliani's got his
[01:54:47.680 --> 01:54:52.400]  big issues he's stopping frisk all that big problems with him but but he was instrumental
[01:54:52.400 --> 01:54:56.800]  on a lot of the stuff that came out that actually helped bring down hillary i get what trump's doing
[01:54:56.800 --> 01:55:03.600]  rewarding people that helped him but john bolton uh as rand paul has warned an article on info wars
[01:55:03.600 --> 01:55:12.000]  dot com don't appoint pro war bolton secretary of state uh bolton is a true piece of work you've got
[01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:18.000]  you've got all this to taunt you've got russia and the united states coming towards each other
[01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:22.720]  when there's no reason to be fighting and bolton is somebody that has been on fox news every time
[01:55:22.720 --> 01:55:30.240]  i turn around basically as hawkish as hillary so um i hate to say lesser of two evils i mean can't
[01:55:30.240 --> 01:55:36.240]  we have you know they're talking about um secretary of state i mean i get that's not military but
[01:55:36.240 --> 01:55:40.240]  it's still important can we get somebody that exposed the government was running al-qaeda an
[01:55:40.240 --> 01:55:48.080]  isis like a general flinn but un john bolton he was the ambassador u.s ambassador the un john bolson
[01:55:48.080 --> 01:55:53.120]  also being considered along with juliani the article's up on info wars dot com another article
[01:55:53.120 --> 01:55:59.120]  the same communists that attacked us at the uh abortion clinic protests we had last year pointing
[01:55:59.120 --> 01:56:04.160]  out that most people aborted are black even though they're 13 of the population whether you like
[01:56:04.160 --> 01:56:07.600]  abortion or not we're pointing out that it's racially targeted because we're so racist we
[01:56:07.600 --> 01:56:11.200]  don't want to kill the black people uh communist protesters arrested for assaulting trump backers
[01:56:11.200 --> 01:56:16.560]  and austin these are some of the same folks that assaulted us and you look at them they look like
[01:56:16.560 --> 01:56:21.440]  their souls have been sucked out this particular guy is the one that goes i kill my kids i love
[01:56:21.440 --> 01:56:27.200]  killing my kids we come back from break i'm gonna play a clip of that sickening evil but that's what
[01:56:27.200 --> 01:56:32.880]  working for evil does to you i mean look at these people and they had folks though driving around in
[01:56:32.880 --> 01:56:38.800]  brand new jaguars and Mercedes dropping them off that would drive by them and wave cash in the year
[01:56:39.360 --> 01:56:43.360]  for i mean these are just soulless people in my opinion anthony freighter i want to thank you for
[01:56:43.360 --> 01:56:46.640]  all the time i want to spend the last few minutes with you i don't know if you want to get into it
[01:56:46.640 --> 01:56:50.160]  that was the most important part of the interview i don't know if you want to go there about what
[01:56:50.160 --> 01:56:55.920]  type of stuff you saw behind the scenes uh with you know artists and people what they were saying
[01:56:55.920 --> 01:57:02.480]  about trump the false flag stuff you told me about yeah you know you ain't seen nothing yet man i know
[01:57:02.480 --> 01:57:09.280]  what they're planning and it's going to be relentless false flags relentless demonization
[01:57:09.280 --> 01:57:16.000]  relentless they they are dedicated to this narrative that um anyone supports trump is
[01:57:16.960 --> 01:57:23.680]  is a nazi is a racist he hates everybody who is not a white male um now i think that whole
[01:57:23.680 --> 01:57:29.280]  paradigm is built on a falsehood and i think it's easily provable but they don't care and
[01:57:29.280 --> 01:57:36.240]  and they are dedicated to destroying and ripping apart this country and it's not just you know
[01:57:36.800 --> 01:57:43.760]  the sorrows guys busting it's real people they they're victims you know and we have to we i think
[01:57:43.760 --> 01:57:50.080]  we have to reach out to them listen i'm a middle of a roll guy i'm not i'm not partisan i am like
[01:57:50.080 --> 01:57:56.800]  gerrard you know political atheists but what's going on here is racial warfare and what you
[01:57:56.800 --> 01:58:01.360]  predicted 10 years ago i've listened to a long time i remember thinking you said like you know this
[01:58:01.360 --> 01:58:05.920]  keeps going it's going to be like a race war on the street and everybody laughs you like the most
[01:58:05.920 --> 01:58:11.520]  absurd notion you could possibly imagine america well what about this close to that actually happening
[01:58:12.320 --> 01:58:18.960]  so you're always pressing you see you see trends and you see where they can lead to and and i
[01:58:18.960 --> 01:58:23.840]  had 10 times you're right um well i think i appreciate that but really it's not me it's history

[02:00:34.480 --> 02:00:38.320]  and they put it up and it's him talking about how dumb conservatives are how he's not a conservative
[02:00:38.320 --> 02:00:43.200]  how he hates his constituents from supposedly 20 years ago we'll put it back on screen it's a fake
[02:00:43.200 --> 02:00:49.120]  news article trimmed out of the newspaper yellowed paper meant to deceive you that's a false flag
[02:00:49.120 --> 02:00:53.760]  folks and that's what anthony frida over a year ago started contacting us with intel watch out for
[02:00:53.760 --> 02:00:58.080]  this watch out for that they're going to plant racist stuff on you on the web on the street and
[02:00:58.080 --> 02:01:04.880]  then we saw it happen and it's it's it's incredible uh that we're going to start seeing all of this
[02:01:04.880 --> 02:01:09.840]  but it's the underhandedness so as much as you can tell us i mean because again you've been on
[02:01:09.840 --> 02:01:15.440]  most of the major covers in the country you know these folks you're there and the type of things
[02:01:15.440 --> 02:01:19.360]  they talk about what they say what they do and then what you say to them because you said we
[02:01:19.360 --> 02:01:27.200]  ain't seen nothing yet no these guys aren't done they're they're planning to um they're doubling
[02:01:27.200 --> 02:01:31.920]  down they're doubling down on the racist thing and they want to rip this country apart along racial
[02:01:31.920 --> 02:01:39.200]  lines tragically and sadly and unnecessarily um and they're going to do with every trick in the
[02:01:39.200 --> 02:01:42.880]  playbook we don't we know the tricks if you've read macchiavelli or if you can all of you
[02:01:43.760 --> 02:01:52.480]  study carol you know all the ways to discredit your enemy and to attribute all the evils in
[02:01:52.480 --> 02:02:00.320]  the world to them and at the same time glorify your your candidate or your position so you're
[02:02:00.320 --> 02:02:05.920]  going to see um you're going to see falses we're already seeing it people write people writing
[02:02:05.920 --> 02:02:12.880]  on the street i love hitler and donald trump and then it's on it's on uh you know 60 minutes i mean
[02:02:12.880 --> 02:02:18.960]  give me a break it's so obvious people can't see it they're blind everybody is blind to
[02:02:19.760 --> 02:02:25.120]  obvious false flags that are almost a childish level a third grade level like my son can see
[02:02:25.120 --> 02:02:32.080]  through it was 12 years old because i i introduced a concept to him at a very early age so he sees
[02:02:32.080 --> 02:02:38.640]  he tells me yeah that's a false flag you know it's like it's about education uh but but people want
[02:02:38.640 --> 02:02:45.200]  to believe things that they're already prejudiced to believe and they wanted to scar things uh that
[02:02:45.200 --> 02:02:51.200]  don't um you know uh reinforced and by the way almost all of the swastikas on the campuses and
[02:02:51.200 --> 02:02:57.760]  all this has turned out are fake done by people just for more attention absolutely it's fake it's
[02:02:57.760 --> 02:03:02.960]  so and so obviously it's a patently fake to me i mean just look at it say yeah i'm gonna draw swastikas
[02:03:02.960 --> 02:03:06.720]  and i love donald trump and i want to you know but here's another thing that gets me crazy about
[02:03:06.720 --> 02:03:13.920]  this whole uh anti-semite and he's he's the cuckoo clan thing so his daughter and his grandchildren
[02:03:13.920 --> 02:03:18.480]  are orthodox jews okay he wants to kill them put them in concentration camps i have people
[02:03:18.480 --> 02:03:23.360]  friends of mine who are mexican americans good people smart people they think he's going to
[02:03:23.360 --> 02:03:29.200]  deport old americans and then and then promoting that idea and then they think he's going to deport
[02:03:29.200 --> 02:03:34.080]  everybody who interviews you know you ate a taco you get the border i mean it's crazy you know it's
[02:03:34.080 --> 02:03:40.560]  like and then cnn comes out this morning i was watching it and goes he needs to call for peace
[02:03:40.560 --> 02:03:44.720]  and admit he's not doing all this to make everybody feel better and not be scared when
[02:03:44.720 --> 02:03:51.600]  they're the ones that need to admit they lied yeah it's really you know listen if i can if i
[02:03:51.600 --> 02:03:56.000]  can give the best piece of advice i give to you know to this i gotta say i'm an objective person
[02:03:56.000 --> 02:04:01.280]  i'm trying to look at this objectively but okay they're calling uh the trump supporters racist
[02:04:01.280 --> 02:04:07.280]  and deplorable you know hillary broke the carnal rule of politics you you can attack your opponent
[02:04:07.280 --> 02:04:12.720]  but don't attack his supporters because if you win that's your constituency you just you just
[02:04:12.720 --> 02:04:17.840]  and if and guess what you're not gonna win because you just alienated all of them they're never
[02:04:17.840 --> 02:04:23.680]  going to come to your side so i i really think that's where hillary blew it despite the fact
[02:04:23.680 --> 02:04:29.360]  that she's a lying warm on our green corrupt horrible you mean uh the fact that she attacked
[02:04:29.360 --> 02:04:36.320]  trump supporters and not just trump was incredibly damaging it showed her arrogance anthony and i
[02:04:36.320 --> 02:04:40.640]  agree with you and and their arrogance is our biggest asset anthony free to dot com

[02:04:53.680 --> 02:05:00.880]  courage to basically look at all different angles stay with us more than half of the anti-trump
[02:05:00.880 --> 02:05:04.960]  protesters arrested in porland didn't vote in oregon according to state election records
[02:05:04.960 --> 02:05:11.600]  article up by kgw 8 news at least 69 demonstrators either didn't turn in a ballot or weren't registered

[02:08:23.120 --> 02:08:32.480]  the alex jones show now we've seen a lot of stonewalling by corporate establishment globalist media
[02:08:33.600 --> 02:08:38.800]  we've seen them deny there were death panels in obama care was there was an irs enforcement arm
[02:08:38.800 --> 02:08:44.080]  even though it said there was and that they wouldn't get up to $5,000 fines if you didn't get obama
[02:08:44.080 --> 02:08:48.240]  care they said if you liked your doctor you could keep it it was all in the bill you couldn't
[02:08:49.120 --> 02:08:53.040]  but they counted on their constitution once not going and reading the legislation but now
[02:08:53.040 --> 02:08:58.240]  they're being hit by the legislation and some polls have it at 87 unpopularity
[02:09:00.160 --> 02:09:06.320]  but the supreme court said that it could be a tax paid to multinational corporations and one
[02:09:06.320 --> 02:09:12.800]  year after his implementation the wall street journal reported a 47 plus percent increase
[02:09:12.800 --> 02:09:22.720]  in insurance profitability worldwide just on the milking of america now if that isn't globalism i
[02:09:22.720 --> 02:09:28.400]  don't what i don't know what is i mean take not the milking but the bleeding of america
[02:09:28.400 --> 02:09:36.240]  with a 100 trillion dollar global carbon tax called for in davos switzerland five years ago and
[02:09:36.240 --> 02:09:40.640]  published in the bbc the london telegraph you name it go look it up the headline
[02:09:42.720 --> 02:09:49.600]  davos wants 100 trillion in new taxes every decade the main funding mechanism a carbon tax
[02:09:50.640 --> 02:09:57.760]  a global government with 100 trillion dollars every decade that's to start 10 trillion a year
[02:09:57.760 --> 02:10:04.560]  and toben taxes currency taxes wellhead taxes all of this the brainchild of
[02:10:05.440 --> 02:10:11.200]  kin lay and in ron and and and al gore and lord rothschild where they own the carbon trading
[02:10:11.920 --> 02:10:18.000]  companies obama's heavily invested and we thought the clinton foundation was corrupt
[02:10:18.000 --> 02:10:22.320]  that's what globalism is is big corporations above the law establishing a corporate system
[02:10:22.320 --> 02:10:28.640]  where their tax exempt and trump is exposing that he's our champion just in what he said
[02:10:28.640 --> 02:10:34.320]  now we'll see if he delivers on it already they say the tpp is close to dead maybe playing possum
[02:10:34.320 --> 02:10:37.760]  but trump wants to go after it he's already looking at how to take the restrictions off our
[02:10:37.760 --> 02:10:42.400]  power plants that were never passed by congress but obama signed on to he's also has daytaunt
[02:10:42.400 --> 02:10:46.640]  with russia right now to take out isis that meeting with putin happened yesterday went from
[02:10:46.640 --> 02:10:53.280]  defense condition three to defense condition five the lowest threat level so good things are
[02:10:53.280 --> 02:10:58.720]  happening but they're coming after him because steven bannon is an anti-globalist now i get
[02:10:58.720 --> 02:11:02.800]  called by the wash and post the new york times on a weekly basis i in about a year have refused to
[02:11:02.800 --> 02:11:06.480]  talk to him and they'll email us and say you will not talk to the new york times excuse me
[02:11:07.600 --> 02:11:14.400]  and i said okay finally i will because some trump folks called and said no these people want to
[02:11:14.400 --> 02:11:19.120]  talk to you this will be a fair piece you know you can clarify things go on i talked to the lady
[02:11:19.120 --> 02:11:26.800]  no peace today but three other ones with yours truly in it saying jones believes in an imaginary
[02:11:26.800 --> 02:11:30.880]  thing called globalism and that's like saying i believe the atlantic ocean is off the coast of
[02:11:30.880 --> 02:11:36.800]  new york city i mean it's literally talking to you like you're a three-year-old that's been knocked
[02:11:36.800 --> 02:11:47.360]  upside the head with a tire iron globalism new york times by liam stack a far-right conspiracy
[02:11:47.360 --> 02:11:55.360]  theory buoyed by trump globalism globalism and then they actually go through it and find scratchy
[02:11:55.360 --> 02:11:59.680]  clips from me years ago to make it look unprofessional and then they've got some you know college
[02:11:59.680 --> 02:12:04.400]  student as well talking about globalism and and and world government and saying it's a corporate
[02:12:04.400 --> 02:12:09.760]  thing and they have a huge this was i was told in the physical paper as well they had two other ones
[02:12:11.600 --> 02:12:17.520]  where'd the idea come from as where did we get this theory now william f jasper the editor of
[02:12:17.520 --> 02:12:20.480]  new american magazine will be with us for the rest of the hour i wanted to put together though a
[02:12:20.480 --> 02:12:25.280]  little clip today this is what we put together today it's about a four and a half minute clip
[02:12:25.280 --> 02:12:31.680]  and i got a bunch of news articles after it of world leaders the head of the EU the british prime
[02:12:31.680 --> 02:12:36.080]  minister of presidents obama i mean obama just two months ago said we should give up our freedom of
[02:12:36.080 --> 02:12:40.720]  action to the un i mean that means like putting handcuffs on and getting in the truck with jim
[02:12:40.720 --> 02:12:47.200]  you know ted bundy but there's this paradox where they still keep denying it so i wanted to ask
[02:12:47.200 --> 02:12:53.680]  william f jasper where he sees this going because they're discredited they've lost almost all their
[02:12:53.680 --> 02:12:58.960]  readers and viewers because of these activities but they're only doubling down i guess where we
[02:12:58.960 --> 02:13:04.960]  can never have a real debate about it because if they do call al gore before congress they'll just
[02:13:04.960 --> 02:13:11.360]  say there's no carbon tax i mean that you they play these weird gotcha games that are just so bizarre
[02:13:11.360 --> 02:13:15.520]  i don't know what the tactic even is at this point thank god they're still doing it because it's
[02:13:15.520 --> 02:13:20.640]  what's discrediting them they have all these articles about alex jones and steven bannon
[02:13:20.640 --> 02:13:29.600]  of these big racists and never a clip never a quote they just say it so are they the only
[02:13:29.600 --> 02:13:34.640]  ones buying their propaganda let's play this compilation then we're going to go to mr jasper
[02:13:34.640 --> 02:13:38.800]  to lay out the history of world government what's being established because that's what the system
[02:13:38.800 --> 02:13:45.200]  of globalism is but i thought they could deny global government or global governance the system of
[02:13:45.200 --> 02:13:51.280]  global government and it's in and it's operating system but to deny globalism which they push as
[02:13:52.000 --> 02:13:57.440]  the new system for 30 40 years of this is taught everywhere this is like denying the republican
[02:13:57.440 --> 02:14:03.760]  party exists or the george washington or or historical things existed so here is the compilation
[02:14:03.760 --> 02:14:10.880]  we'll go to mr jasper we have before us the opportunity to forge for ourselves and for
[02:14:10.880 --> 02:14:18.000]  future generations a new world order a world where the rule of law not the law of the jungle
[02:14:18.640 --> 02:14:26.400]  governs the conduct of nations when we are successful and we will be we have a real chance
[02:14:26.400 --> 02:14:33.040]  at this new world order an order in which a credible united nations can use its peacekeeping
[02:14:33.040 --> 02:14:41.520]  role to fulfill the promise and vision of the un's founders it is a big idea a new world order
[02:14:42.640 --> 02:14:49.600]  a world in which there is the very real prospect of a new world order after 1989 president bush
[02:14:49.600 --> 02:14:55.520]  kept said and it's a phrase that i often use myself that we needed a new world order there is a
[02:14:55.520 --> 02:15:02.080]  chance for the president of the united states to use this disaster to carry out what his father
[02:15:02.080 --> 02:15:07.360]  a phrase his father used i think only once and hasn't been used since and that is a new world
[02:15:07.360 --> 02:15:13.520]  order so that the problem of the bush presidency will be the emergence of a new international
[02:15:13.520 --> 02:15:22.880]  order within the next four years we will see the emergence of a new international order the pieces
[02:15:22.880 --> 02:15:30.960]  are in flux soon they will settle again before they do let us reorder this world around us
[02:15:30.960 --> 02:15:39.440]  i think his path will be to develop an overall strategy for america in this period when really
[02:15:39.440 --> 02:15:45.920]  a new world order can be created it's a great opportunity and hasn't just a crisis it's about
[02:15:45.920 --> 02:15:53.520]  the future of europe and a new world order there's a need for a new world order but it has different
[02:15:53.520 --> 02:16:02.480]  characteristics in different parts of of the world but today with asia already out producing europe
[02:16:03.360 --> 02:16:11.280]  india and china are clearly becoming part of our new order we are now facing a common challenge
[02:16:11.280 --> 02:16:23.040]  and the challenge is how to build a world order for the first time in history on a global basis
[02:16:23.600 --> 02:16:31.280]  so in conclusion ladies and gentlemen a new world is emerging it is a new world order
[02:16:31.280 --> 02:16:38.480]  with significantly different and radically new challenges the affirmative task we have now
[02:16:38.480 --> 02:16:45.520]  is is to actually um create a new world order
[02:16:45.520 --> 02:16:51.680]  good evening everybody president obama and british prime minister gordon today calling for a new
[02:16:51.680 --> 02:16:58.160]  world order to tackle our global economic crisis and the president outlined his vision of a new
[02:16:58.160 --> 02:17:04.480]  world order in which the us would participate fully we've got to give them a stake in creating the
[02:17:04.480 --> 02:17:09.920]  kind of world order that i think all of us would like to see so i see a world order in the future
[02:17:09.920 --> 02:17:16.000]  with a multi-polar world order i think the new world order is emerging and with it the foundations
[02:17:16.000 --> 02:17:23.040]  of a new and progressive era of international cooperation but in a globalized economy we
[02:17:23.040 --> 02:17:28.640]  are going to have to take global responsibilities and they're going to is going to have to be some
[02:17:28.640 --> 02:17:34.880]  several assemblies of global governance never before has a new world order had to be assembled from so
[02:17:34.880 --> 02:17:42.320]  many different perceptions or on so global scale nor has any previous order had to combine the
[02:17:42.320 --> 02:17:49.200]  attributes of the historic balance of power system with global democratic opinion and the exploding
[02:17:49.200 --> 02:17:56.400]  technology of the contemporary period and i strongly believe india will be a central actor
[02:17:56.400 --> 02:18:02.800]  in the new world order there also exists an extraordinary opportunity to form for the first
[02:18:02.800 --> 02:18:10.320]  time in history a truly global society 2009 is also the first year of global governance with
[02:18:10.320 --> 02:18:16.000]  the establishment of a g20 in the middle of financial crisis the climate conference in
[02:18:16.000 --> 02:18:22.000]  copernican is another step towards the global management of our planet new world order is
[02:18:22.000 --> 02:18:27.600]  the headline in the global mail in canada is this global governance at last is it one world the
[02:18:27.600 --> 02:18:32.480]  central bank is in charge but aren't we all just living and dying for what the central banks do
[02:18:32.480 --> 02:18:40.080]  of course we are we are absolutely slaves to central banks and then the articles another new
[02:18:40.080 --> 02:18:46.080]  world order major papers announcing world government roiders banks face new world order
[02:18:46.080 --> 02:18:50.560]  consolidation but the really big video edition is a compilation of the same global government
[02:18:50.560 --> 02:18:56.320]  world government new world order a map they describe it as this corporately run system with
[02:18:56.320 --> 02:19:01.680]  global corporate taxes henry kissinger again outlines this is a planetary government with
[02:19:01.680 --> 02:19:09.280]  global governance are the terms you want to search global governance global government those are the
[02:19:09.280 --> 02:19:12.880]  videos we're going to put together later for you with that specific clip over and over again as
[02:19:12.880 --> 02:19:18.320]  well we showed a few of those clips is it factor fiction us media says the world order is in jeopardy
[02:19:18.320 --> 02:19:24.160]  with trump and it goes on and on how they're establishing this corporate world government
[02:19:24.160 --> 02:19:29.680]  the bankers at davos call it a technocracy moving to a form of corporate government
[02:19:30.960 --> 02:19:37.600]  run by global elites yes new world order pushes back on briggs at revolution sovereign nations
[02:19:37.600 --> 02:19:46.320]  trying to get out of the eu huge mega states taking over and conquering but if you say any of
[02:19:46.320 --> 02:19:50.720]  this exists you're insane if you go read the financial times of london where they actually say
[02:19:51.840 --> 02:19:57.200]  the big headline and we want to show folks and now for global government financial times of
[02:19:57.200 --> 02:20:00.560]  london we'll put that on screen for you in fact i'm going to just be here for the next hour while
[02:20:00.560 --> 02:20:03.920]  jasper talks i'm going to be putting headlines on screen for everybody to get ready for you to see
[02:20:03.920 --> 02:20:09.920]  all those for yourself uh mr jasper there's just so much proof of this they're here just denying it
[02:20:09.920 --> 02:20:15.280]  life they did back uh you know back in the 60s and things it's but now it's here there's the
[02:20:15.280 --> 02:20:20.080]  financial times of london and now for world government now he announces yes you're dumb
[02:20:20.080 --> 02:20:24.880]  yes we're authoritarian yes we know best that's the foreign editor for the financial times so
[02:20:24.880 --> 02:20:31.600]  they admit all of this now but then the the the new york times just unextricably just says
[02:20:32.160 --> 02:20:37.600]  what is this mr jones what's this word globalism we've never heard of it and talks to their viewers
[02:20:38.320 --> 02:20:43.520]  like what's this thing called washington dc these weirdos believe there's a place on
[02:20:43.520 --> 02:20:49.040]  pennsylvania avenue called the capital or a white house i mean what's the tactic here mr jasper
[02:20:49.920 --> 02:20:56.080]  this bald-faced denial what you're talking about here it is it's very ridiculous it's absurd it's
[02:20:56.080 --> 02:21:02.720]  difficult to figure out exactly what they're trying to do here because as you pointed out and as we've
[02:21:02.720 --> 02:21:09.840]  been pointing out at the new american i mean my my book uh global tyranny step by step the subtitle
[02:21:09.840 --> 02:21:17.440]  is the the united nations in the emerging new world order and it's replete with quotes taken from
[02:21:17.440 --> 02:21:24.160]  newspaper articles from books whole books don't uh dedicated to the new world order by globalists
[02:21:24.160 --> 02:21:29.280]  themselves people who identify themselves as globalists who are for the new world order the
[02:21:29.280 --> 02:21:35.760]  Kissinger's the Brent scowcross the big new brazilian skis uh george soros who who recently
[02:21:35.760 --> 02:21:40.720]  told that the uh the newsweek editors who work for the clintons he said national sovereignty is
[02:21:40.720 --> 02:21:46.320]  going to be abolished right and this is a this is a very key thing what when they start talking
[02:21:46.320 --> 02:21:51.200]  about globalism they try to soften it by talking about what we're talking about globalization and
[02:21:51.200 --> 02:21:56.960]  about increased trade and cooperation among nations no they're not talking about cooperation
[02:21:56.960 --> 02:22:02.480]  they're talking about coercion of building global governance global institutions that will have
[02:22:02.480 --> 02:22:10.480]  world power legislative executive judicial power military and police power to override nation states
[02:22:10.480 --> 02:22:18.960]  to destroy first of all to erode and then destroy uh national sovereignty they do not want a united
[02:22:18.960 --> 02:22:26.400]  states with a constitutionally limited government being able to uh in any way resist their their
[02:22:26.400 --> 02:22:33.760]  plans for global governance which is total takeover the financial political uh educational
[02:22:33.760 --> 02:22:38.640]  all all systems everything that we uh rely on as part of our culture and our economy and our
[02:22:38.640 --> 02:22:46.560]  government uh they want that to be all under global controls uh they cannot uh allow us to
[02:22:46.560 --> 02:22:52.320]  continue running our own lives and that's what national sovereignty of course is all about and
[02:22:52.320 --> 02:22:57.680]  so you see richard haas president of the council on foreign relations uh zbigniew brzezinski
[02:22:57.680 --> 02:23:03.680]  henry kissinger constantly attacking national sovereignty and they say as president obama
[02:23:04.560 --> 02:23:10.320]  said in this recent article that you referred to the new york times that oh we saw world war one
[02:23:10.320 --> 02:23:17.360]  and world war two all of the the death and destruction that it that those conflicts brought to the
[02:23:17.360 --> 02:23:23.120]  continent of europe and to all of the world it was the result of nations failing to cooperate and
[02:23:23.120 --> 02:23:29.040]  he said we don't want to see a repetition of that that is the theme of the false narrative that has
[02:23:29.040 --> 02:23:37.360]  been given to us in our textbooks and by our world leaders uh globalists for the last uh several
[02:23:37.360 --> 02:23:44.640]  generations and of course uh that isn't that isn't true at all the world war one and world war two
[02:23:44.640 --> 02:23:51.040]  were actually initiated by the globalists to actually and by the way that's not your opinion
[02:23:52.080 --> 02:23:58.240]  lord millner what by 1920 or so wrote articles in the newspapers admitting they orchestrated
[02:23:59.520 --> 02:24:02.800]  admitting that they were going to bring in a planetary government for the british empire
[02:24:02.800 --> 02:24:07.280]  out of this we're not blaming the british but that's the model that's been used i mean here's
[02:24:07.280 --> 02:24:13.520]  obama today in greece obama on trump's election we have to guard against a rise in a crude sort of
[02:24:13.520 --> 02:24:19.280]  nationalism oh see us having our own country's crude it's racist uh and i've got other ones here we
[02:24:19.280 --> 02:24:26.080]  said two months ago while he was uh at the un that we need to go ahead and cede our mobility we need
[02:24:26.080 --> 02:24:32.880]  to cede uh our own power for action we need to give our sovereignty over and he quote has problems
[02:24:32.880 --> 02:24:39.120]  with backward americans not letting him do this i mean this is so arrogant well and this is where uh
[02:24:39.120 --> 02:24:46.480]  we see all around us today we see it particularly with the migration and refugee they call it immigration
[02:24:46.480 --> 02:24:52.400]  but it's migration uh that was set up again by the globalists uh we see here in the last
[02:24:52.400 --> 02:24:56.480]  peter southerland admits the head of the un's program the founder of the eu he took a demotion
[02:24:56.480 --> 02:24:59.840]  to run this that they're going to flood the countries it came out in wiki leagues as well
[02:24:59.840 --> 02:25:05.280]  but he's public and end our sovereignty uh via conquest by third world populations of course
[02:25:05.280 --> 02:25:09.600]  they're not going to get any of the booty the spoils they're just using them well i'm peter
[02:25:09.600 --> 02:25:15.280]  southerland of course is the ultimate globalist insider goldman sacks uh european council on
[02:25:15.280 --> 02:25:21.920]  foreign relations trilateral commission boulderberg all of the the organizations the globalist new
[02:25:21.920 --> 02:25:28.800]  world order organizations that the establishment media says don't exist or are benign inconsequential
[02:25:28.800 --> 02:25:35.760]  uh social mingling groups and uh peter southerland and george soros with his uh
[02:25:37.440 --> 02:25:43.120]  international migration institute uh were the ones that put this together and of course george
[02:25:43.120 --> 02:25:49.600]  soros uh last year said that the new world order has to feature china as the center of
[02:25:49.600 --> 02:25:55.440]  communist china as the center of the new world order and that's of course what these insiders
[02:25:55.440 --> 02:26:00.960]  have been building for the last couple of years on a telegraph article from uh 2009
[02:26:00.960 --> 02:26:05.760]  there'll be nowhere to run from the new world order global thinking won't necessarily solve
[02:26:05.760 --> 02:26:10.640]  the world's problems says and then it just goes on like you must accept it you must let us run your
[02:26:10.640 --> 02:26:16.960]  country and then we see all these big top bankers end up getting installed now as prime ministers
[02:26:16.960 --> 02:26:23.600]  it ending votes in some european countries this is naked authoritarianism well that that was
[02:26:23.600 --> 02:26:30.080]  clearly the case in in italy where we saw the mario brothers put in there uh as had
[02:26:30.080 --> 02:26:35.600]  it had of the uh central bank and as prime minister and we've seen throughout europe and
[02:26:35.600 --> 02:26:40.560]  in that article that you referred to from the new york times they talk about far right and alt
[02:26:40.560 --> 02:26:47.600]  right uh extremism etc but look what have we had for the last generation here all over europe we've
[02:26:47.600 --> 02:26:55.840]  had members of the socialist international the si uh running europe and currently today uh most of
[02:26:55.840 --> 02:27:02.880]  the nations in the united nations and in the european union are members of the the ruling
[02:27:02.880 --> 02:27:08.720]  parties are members of the socialist international which traces its back its heritage back probably
[02:27:08.720 --> 02:27:14.560]  to carl marx social is his organization then they play this game again we're not communists
[02:27:14.560 --> 02:27:19.600]  we're socialists and it's always filthy rich people that are tax exempt telling little people
[02:27:19.600 --> 02:27:24.960]  you got to give your money to the poor they really mean to them well all of these socialists
[02:27:24.960 --> 02:27:31.680]  international leaders they're they're regularly there at all the world economic forum gatherings
[02:27:31.680 --> 02:27:37.360]  in davos switzerland at the bill de berg groups etc they're mixing with goldman sacks and chase
[02:27:37.360 --> 02:27:46.480]  Manhattan bank and uh jp morgan chase etc uh so there is this unholy alliance between the heads
[02:27:46.480 --> 02:27:53.040]  of these various socialist groups and these ngo's that claim to be working for the working man for
[02:27:53.040 --> 02:28:00.160]  the little people uh but you see they're in bed with and in the penthouses with all of the wall
[02:28:00.160 --> 02:28:06.320]  street globalists and that's the way it's been much of this century and so what we see right now
[02:28:06.320 --> 02:28:13.760]  after the elections with all of the uh riots and demonstrations that are going on all across the
[02:28:13.760 --> 02:28:21.280]  country all of these are synthetic astroturf organizations funded principally by george
[02:28:21.280 --> 02:28:27.840]  soros and his colleagues in the various other tax exempt foundations for rockefeller carnage
[02:28:27.840 --> 02:28:37.920]  uh et cetera uh so uh today we we are seeing why back in the 1950s when the reese committee of the
[02:28:37.920 --> 02:28:44.160]  house uh of representatives was investigating the tax exempt foundations it was investigating
[02:28:44.160 --> 02:28:48.720]  the ford foundation rockefeller foundation carnage endowment principally but other
[02:28:48.720 --> 02:28:54.480]  foundations as well why that was so important and why the new york times and all of the media at
[02:28:54.480 --> 02:29:00.400]  that time came down on them because all of this infrastructure was being built at that time which
[02:29:00.400 --> 02:29:06.800]  we now see there are thousands of organizations which receive literally billions of dollars every
[02:29:06.800 --> 02:29:13.200]  year to create the impression of popular support for all we're talking about a massive astroturf
[02:29:13.200 --> 02:29:17.520]  network of people screaming racist racist if you don't want foreign banks to be stealing
[02:29:17.520 --> 02:29:22.080]  trillions from your country uh with a bunch of globalist meaning in secret with world leaders
[02:29:22.080 --> 02:29:27.520]  telling us it doesn't exist but that whole facade is falling so where do you see this going next and
[02:29:27.520 --> 02:29:31.360]  i also want to get more into the nuts and bolts one of the top experts in the world on globalism
[02:29:31.360 --> 02:29:37.680]  william f jasper yes we're here talking about imaginary things uh like puff the magic dragon
[02:29:37.680 --> 02:29:42.240]  no we're talking about the real structure of the world the globalist all right books admitting it
[02:29:42.240 --> 02:29:47.440]  we give you footage of it all over the world and the new york times tells us readers it doesn't
[02:29:47.440 --> 02:29:55.760]  exist period we're on the march the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network
[02:29:59.600 --> 02:30:03.520]  more than half of the anti-trump protesters arrested in porland didn't vote in oregon
[02:30:03.520 --> 02:30:09.120]  according to state election records article up by k g w eight news at least 69 demonstrators
[02:30:09.120 --> 02:30:13.760]  either didn't turn in a ballot or weren't registered to vote in the state k g w compility
[02:30:13.760 --> 02:30:19.120]  lists of the 112 people arrested by the porland police bureau during recent protests those names
[02:30:19.120 --> 02:30:25.360]  and ages provided by police were then compared to state voter logs by multnomath county elections
[02:30:25.360 --> 02:30:30.320]  officials records show 34 of the protesters arrested didn't turn in a ballot for the november
[02:30:30.320 --> 02:30:35.120]  eighth election 35 of the demonstrators taken into custody weren't even registered to vote and yet
[02:30:35.120 --> 02:30:40.320]  they're out there bitching about donald trump they're so upset that donald trump's gonna destroy
[02:30:40.320 --> 02:30:45.120]  america but they couldn't even take the time to register to vote or even go out and vote k g w is
[02:30:45.120 --> 02:30:49.440]  still working to verify voting records of the remaining 17 protesters who are arrested people
[02:30:49.440 --> 02:30:53.200]  always want to bitch about something and they're too lazy to go out themselves and make change
[02:30:53.200 --> 02:30:57.760]  this has been joe biggs with info wars dot com and guess what trump supporters showed up in record

[02:34:16.240 --> 02:34:21.840]  percent tyranny and i talked to the pseudo-intellectuals i mean i've had the host of abc manley knows
[02:34:21.840 --> 02:34:27.280]  here i showed him six clips of herman von rumpi and others and gordon brown calling for global
[02:34:27.280 --> 02:34:31.600]  governance and he went oh that's another global government they're talking about not not the one
[02:34:31.600 --> 02:34:37.440]  you're talking about he smiled and he wanted to go to dinner so at dinner he just admitted it
[02:34:38.000 --> 02:34:41.840]  he just of course we know it's all alex whatever i work for you i work for you work for you work
[02:34:41.840 --> 02:34:48.240]  for it's all just a big joke size the public's too dumb to ever care now there's the e u leader let's
[02:34:48.240 --> 02:34:54.240]  play it uh von rumpi calls for global government i've got a bunch of other clips i want to play too
[02:34:54.240 --> 02:34:58.000]  but but uh in fact the crew did a great job throwing that quick compilation together but i'm
[02:34:58.000 --> 02:35:01.760]  i may not have been clear new world order is fine and articles saying it means world government
[02:35:01.760 --> 02:35:05.840]  but i want to get the clips we've got a lot of folks don't have from c span and stuff where they
[02:35:05.840 --> 02:35:11.440]  admit what new world order is a global corporate government but the supernational dominance of
[02:35:11.440 --> 02:35:17.440]  international bankers over it that's what barry goldwater said it was back in the 60s now we know
[02:35:17.440 --> 02:35:23.680]  that's the plan but look at this chicago will be a sanctuary city no matter what the feds say
[02:35:25.040 --> 02:35:30.240]  la pd chief we won't deport boston we will not cooperate with immigration officials and that
[02:35:30.240 --> 02:35:38.480]  means when they talk about it that means with felons that means with criminals that means with
[02:35:38.480 --> 02:35:42.960]  drunk drivers murderers arsonist rapists that's what trump always talked about then they turn
[02:35:42.960 --> 02:35:47.680]  around to he wants to deport people's parents and leave their kids here all alone never said any of
[02:35:47.680 --> 02:35:56.560]  that that's weird i've never seen my uh laptop do that that's something interesting that's kind of
[02:35:56.560 --> 02:36:01.600]  cool you guys might want to come in here and get this i was just uh showing people that
[02:36:01.600 --> 02:36:08.880]  think about all the stuff that's wired into these it's like one of those eas alert systems they've
[02:36:08.880 --> 02:36:13.360]  got now that's all wired into everything all our appliances all wired into big brother i'm sure
[02:36:13.360 --> 02:36:17.280]  that was just a little malfunction but the point is it's in the news today where they're gonna have
[02:36:17.280 --> 02:36:23.040]  all the drones in america wired into a central system run by the nsa controlled by at&t and
[02:36:23.040 --> 02:36:28.960]  nasa to build national drone tracking system isn't at all special they call their global
[02:36:28.960 --> 02:36:35.200]  governance management system a technocracy we're a group of technocrats international bankers in
[02:36:35.200 --> 02:36:41.680]  their own words read davos that google davos says technocrats to run the world and implanted
[02:36:42.560 --> 02:36:46.640]  processors in all devices will make sure you comply we're gonna go back to our guests in a
[02:36:46.640 --> 02:36:50.480]  moment but since we mentioned it here's the president two months ago saying we should see
[02:36:50.480 --> 02:36:56.160]  sovereignty of the un for our security not that barbarous nationalism that he was just talking
[02:36:56.160 --> 02:37:01.760]  about today here it is and we can only realize the promise of this institution's founding
[02:37:02.960 --> 02:37:10.640]  to replace the ravages of war with cooperation if powerful nations like my own accept constraints
[02:37:13.200 --> 02:37:15.680]  sometimes i'm criticized in my own country
[02:37:17.440 --> 02:37:24.000]  or professing a belief in international norms and multilateral institutions but i am convinced
[02:37:24.000 --> 02:37:31.840]  that in the long run giving up some freedom of action not giving up our ability to protect
[02:37:31.840 --> 02:37:37.920]  ourselves or pursue our core interests but binding ourselves to international rules
[02:37:38.720 --> 02:37:44.400]  over the long term enhances our security while you run around turning jotties lists and
[02:37:44.400 --> 02:37:49.840]  breaking all those own same rules and notice international groups like the secret tpp and
[02:37:49.840 --> 02:37:55.200]  the secret wto and all these secret groups and groups never heard of the oecd coming and overseeing
[02:37:55.200 --> 02:37:59.440]  our elections in the un oh and the un telling our police what to do and they're not stopping
[02:37:59.440 --> 02:38:04.080]  because their whole investment is on this so is trump for real the fact that he raised all
[02:38:04.080 --> 02:38:09.360]  these topics is irrevocably damaging the internal emails admit they hate him they don't like him
[02:38:09.360 --> 02:38:14.960]  now the question is was he just coming in to take over this whole thing from him the true alpha
[02:38:14.960 --> 02:38:20.400]  goblin or is he really trying to restore the republic i i think he's for real i mean do you
[02:38:20.400 --> 02:38:25.600]  think he really be calling me last week and calling me other times i'm just gonna stop right there
[02:38:25.600 --> 02:38:30.240]  and i know donald trump jr for for a fact's a big listener i mean trump isn't out to get the country
[02:38:30.240 --> 02:38:35.520]  i'm gonna ask jasper this question in a moment but first one more clip here's another clip
[02:38:35.520 --> 02:38:45.680]  this is today in greece obama very slowly very methodically talking about the crude nationalism
[02:38:45.680 --> 02:38:52.320]  and just how terrible it is that we don't want to have china with energy three times cheaper than
[02:38:52.320 --> 02:38:58.160]  ours because we shut off all of our coal plants or we don't want to have china with lower tariffs
[02:38:58.160 --> 02:39:02.880]  than us so that we can't compete you know simple stuff like hey we don't want to be screwed over
[02:39:02.880 --> 02:39:12.080]  here it is i do believe separate and apart from any particular election uh or movement
[02:39:13.120 --> 02:39:20.240]  that we are going to have to guard against a rise in
[02:39:20.240 --> 02:39:31.520]  a crude sort of nationalism or ethnic identity or tribalism
[02:39:32.880 --> 02:39:38.640]  that is built around and us and of them all they do is push that the leftists are all about
[02:39:38.640 --> 02:39:49.280]  what group you're in and i will never apologize for saying that the future of humanity and the
[02:39:49.280 --> 02:39:57.120]  future of the world is going to be defined by what we have in common as opposed to those things that
[02:39:57.120 --> 02:40:02.160]  separate africans as you can't have cars or air conditioning conflict yeah everybody better study
[02:40:02.160 --> 02:40:06.880]  what globalism is everybody better find out it means deindustrialization enslavement eugenics
[02:40:06.880 --> 02:40:11.600]  total control everyone should see my film in game blueprint for global enslavement it's free online
[02:40:11.600 --> 02:40:15.600]  so everybody you know it was made nine years ago you watch it you go with this all came true
[02:40:15.600 --> 02:40:19.520]  how do you know this because they all write textbooks and white paper to each other they
[02:40:19.520 --> 02:40:24.320]  think you're too dumb to look at it so that said william ab jasper new american magazine will give
[02:40:24.320 --> 02:40:30.240]  out that url and put that on screen for folks as well the new american dot com paul watson's
[02:40:30.240 --> 02:40:34.560]  gonna be hosting in about 25 minutes uh the fourth hour with big breaking news from london
[02:40:34.560 --> 02:40:39.440]  the new american dot com people should subscribe you can buy the magazine i know in bulk at cost to
[02:40:39.440 --> 02:40:45.680]  give to folks great films great books great material uh super dead on uh in fact sometimes
[02:40:45.680 --> 02:40:49.360]  not behind the curve but you know they're they're they're so conservative sometimes they
[02:40:49.360 --> 02:40:54.720]  you know wait a while which is fine the point is it's really good material uh to get out to folks
[02:40:54.720 --> 02:40:58.880]  and just let people know about the real world so so so we played all those clips and we could
[02:40:58.880 --> 02:41:04.080]  tackle any area you want but i mean where should we go what is global governance what do they want
[02:41:04.080 --> 02:41:09.520]  to do with this global governance uh how do we stop them it was very interesting that that president
[02:41:09.520 --> 02:41:15.280]  obama in that first clip that you played there said you know well we we have to accept constraints
[02:41:15.280 --> 02:41:22.880]  but you notice he is not willing to accept the constraints which he took a note to uh take on
[02:41:22.880 --> 02:41:30.960]  as president of the united states our constitution puts restraints and constraints on him and on all
[02:41:30.960 --> 02:41:36.960]  members of our government on the legislative executive and the judicial however they are
[02:41:36.960 --> 02:41:44.800]  claiming a higher calling to put constraints on us on we the people on our national independence
[02:41:44.800 --> 02:41:52.240]  and sovereignty and that is that is one of the the real big uh crimes it's taking place here
[02:41:52.240 --> 02:41:59.760]  he and his fellow globalists are uh claiming this righteousness about trying to uh bring about world
[02:41:59.760 --> 02:42:05.680]  peace which is what they have been using since the uh launch of the united nations since the
[02:42:05.680 --> 02:42:10.240]  league of nations as you said earlier the league of nations even before their their first big try
[02:42:10.800 --> 02:42:17.280]  at world order and in fact uh one of the books that i cite in in uh in my book global tyranny and
[02:42:17.280 --> 02:42:22.560]  my other one the united nations is the third try at world order the first try was the league of
[02:42:22.560 --> 02:42:29.200]  nations second try was the uh united nations and the third try is now to make the united
[02:42:29.200 --> 02:42:35.840]  nations the full uh world government that was intended by those founders that both george
[02:42:35.840 --> 02:42:42.160]  bush george h.w. bush and president obama sure we've documented it's happening how is it going
[02:42:42.160 --> 02:42:48.320]  for him how does trump figure in i mean well this is this is this is going to be very interesting
[02:42:48.320 --> 02:42:55.920]  and and all of us uh who are very hopeful for uh mr trump now president elect trump are going to
[02:42:55.920 --> 02:43:03.040]  have to watch very carefully and we have to see first of all who is he going to a point and uh
[02:43:03.680 --> 02:43:12.240]  you know there it's obvious that as president he has to try to mend some fences uh and he's
[02:43:12.240 --> 02:43:19.280]  reaching out to some people that many of us are very suspicious of uh the paul ryan's and the
[02:43:19.280 --> 02:43:24.160]  rinse prejudices and others who have been part of the republican establishment that has been
[02:43:24.160 --> 02:43:32.480]  selling us out for uh decades uh can they be worked with well he has to work with them to a degree but
[02:43:33.280 --> 02:43:39.120]  uh what we have to really be concerned about is if we start seeing members of the globalist
[02:43:39.120 --> 02:43:45.360]  establishment the council on foreign relations trilateral commissioners uh showing up uh that's
[02:43:45.360 --> 02:43:53.040]  right he better not appoint richard in haas yes well that was his his dropping of that possibility
[02:43:53.040 --> 02:43:59.440]  in one of his early uh interviews with threat bearer box when he was asked who would uh he'd
[02:43:59.440 --> 02:44:04.240]  view as a as a good uh foreign policy advisor and he mentioned richard haas the president of the
[02:44:04.240 --> 02:44:11.200]  council on foreign relations and i don't really know what uh drove him to make that by the way he
[02:44:11.200 --> 02:44:14.240]  ended up meeting with him because i'll tell you trump's really smart but he doesn't know all the
[02:44:14.240 --> 02:44:19.520]  stuff he doesn't get online he only reads newspapers he is a nationalist but i'll be honest he's
[02:44:19.520 --> 02:44:24.480]  super smart at what he knows at 70 but he's got some gray areas and you know and some black
[02:44:24.480 --> 02:44:29.280]  touters understandable too he's a he's a businessman he's been very active in a lot of things and
[02:44:29.280 --> 02:44:36.080]  without trying to make excuses i've told people well uh you know we have to we'll have to watch
[02:44:36.080 --> 02:44:42.640]  and see but let me just give you a very quick uh uh scenario that actually played out a number of
[02:44:42.640 --> 02:44:48.720]  years ago you remember in 1980 when uh ronald reagan was running against george bush in the
[02:44:48.720 --> 02:44:57.200]  primary yes and going into the new hampshire primary this is 1980 uh george bush uh was
[02:44:57.200 --> 02:45:02.080]  outed as a member of the trilateral commission the council on foreign relations and putting all
[02:45:02.080 --> 02:45:09.360]  these trilateralists in his entourage and so the reagan administration knocked him on that well i
[02:45:09.360 --> 02:45:16.320]  got a call from the reagan campaign i got a call from the reagan campaign uh from a congressman
[02:45:16.320 --> 02:45:22.800]  who was one of his top advisors a good congressman john russell who was my congressman in california
[02:45:22.800 --> 02:45:29.360]  and the congressman russell called and he said is it true that george bush is a member of the
[02:45:29.360 --> 02:45:33.600]  of the trilateral commission and i said uh yes it is and he said well how do you know that
[02:45:33.600 --> 02:45:38.400]  and i said well because i have a copy of their membership list this is pretty pre-internet you
[02:45:38.400 --> 02:45:43.280]  know so this stuff let me stop you you steal my thunder this is so incredible in the 70s and 80s
[02:45:43.280 --> 02:45:48.320]  even early 90s they knew there wasn't an internet so they would get on tv we have the clips we've
[02:45:48.320 --> 02:45:52.880]  actually sent out the cbs and got them for films we made an nbc there we go they claimed there's a
[02:45:52.880 --> 02:45:59.040]  group called the trilateral commission and that it does things they would again deny it even existed
[02:45:59.040 --> 02:46:04.720]  where you had congressman having to call you wanting to see a fact proof so they could show
[02:46:04.720 --> 02:46:10.320]  it to george herbert walker i mean that's the levels we've come from please continue absolutely
[02:46:10.320 --> 02:46:16.320]  and so and so he said well how do you know it's a real list i said well it's it was published by
[02:46:16.320 --> 02:46:20.880]  them i i picked it up at their office in new york he says they have an office in new york i said
[02:46:20.880 --> 02:46:29.760]  yes i was there of it i said well can you get it to us so i did i at that time even fax machines
[02:46:29.760 --> 02:46:35.360]  were a rarity they had telefax machines that spun around i remember you told me the story
[02:46:35.360 --> 02:46:41.600]  like 15 years ago that's why i remembered it yeah and and so i i uh faxed off to him and so then
[02:46:41.600 --> 02:46:48.240]  they made a speech for reagan in which he denounced the the trilateral commission globalism etc and
[02:46:48.240 --> 02:46:53.120]  that was uh and that's the tv clip we sent off and got was reagan given that speech almost nobody
[02:46:53.120 --> 02:46:57.600]  has and then the whole media freaking out uh going well the trilateral commission just wants
[02:46:57.600 --> 02:47:01.200]  countries to work together so they had to admit because the candidate finally talked about it
[02:47:01.200 --> 02:47:07.440]  that it existed and then what happened so immediately after he is elected we have george
[02:47:07.440 --> 02:47:12.800]  bush and all the trilateralists and council on foreign relation members being appointed to his
[02:47:12.800 --> 02:47:21.600]  cabinet and so what that showed at the time and in fact uh even as we were reporting on president
[02:47:21.600 --> 02:47:28.640]  reagan attacking the trilateral commission we were cautioning people saying but he has all of these
[02:47:28.640 --> 02:47:35.040]  advisors in his entourage that look like they're going to go that direction themselves and that's
[02:47:35.040 --> 02:47:40.400]  what happened after he was elected he put george bush and all of the trilaterals then and all of
[02:47:40.400 --> 02:47:46.160]  the conservatives who had worked to elect him were on the outside exactly let's talk about that
[02:47:46.160 --> 02:47:50.240]  briefly let's talk about that because we're about to go to break i i mean i think trump's
[02:47:50.240 --> 02:47:53.600]  even more of a maverick than reagan but clearly that because they're so much more afraid of him
[02:47:53.600 --> 02:47:58.000]  but but yes here's what they're doing to trump and they admit they're doing this they're panicking
[02:47:58.000 --> 02:48:02.080]  and they haven't done it they go there's four thousand people no one's gonna age you they're
[02:48:02.080 --> 02:48:06.160]  claiming he didn't even know that he didn't keep the white house staff no he knew the point is
[02:48:06.160 --> 02:48:10.720]  is that they panic you and say no one's gonna work with you if you don't put people in from the
[02:48:10.720 --> 02:48:15.760]  establishment and then what's the president do when the bureaucracy the fourth the fifth of state
[02:48:15.760 --> 02:48:21.440]  holds you hostage and it's almost like air traffic controllers going on strike what do you do then
[02:48:21.440 --> 02:48:27.120]  because that's how they get presidents like reagan and now trump to roll over well and that's
[02:48:27.120 --> 02:48:36.320]  true they have we have allowed them over the last 50 60 70 years actually going clear back to fdr to
[02:48:36.320 --> 02:48:43.840]  world war two they have controlled and have become the shadow government and so it is very difficult
[02:48:43.840 --> 02:48:49.040]  for anyone coming in to be able to break through that's what ron paul said two days ago he said
[02:48:49.040 --> 02:48:52.720]  hey trump may be a great guy but the shadow government is going to completely ignore him
[02:48:52.720 --> 02:49:00.160]  you will they will sabotage him at every level and so the one the one advantage well a number
[02:49:00.160 --> 02:49:08.960]  of advantages that uh trump has that reagan did not and that is uh he reagan may have believed
[02:49:08.960 --> 02:49:17.920]  in all of his ideology that he had been uh spewing out for for a long time i don't know he uh but
[02:49:17.920 --> 02:49:27.760]  he was certainly a a a man who allowed uh those around him to to run him and control him uh
[02:49:27.760 --> 02:49:32.240]  trump is a much different uh personality and that's why they're scared of him he's done
[02:49:32.240 --> 02:49:37.280]  everything on his own he's known exactly for doing what pigheadedly whatever he wants that
[02:49:37.280 --> 02:49:43.680]  that's what he is he is independently wealthy he he is not reliant upon them he can do things
[02:49:43.680 --> 02:49:49.760]  outside of the box that other people can't and so it's going to be very tough for them if they can't
[02:49:50.480 --> 02:49:57.200]  sabotage him and and get him to bend to go into their box uh the next thing we and we talked about
[02:49:57.200 --> 02:50:03.520]  this before is that uh they will be looking for ways to get rid of him and uh this is where he
[02:50:03.520 --> 02:50:10.000]  has to be very careful literally for his for his safety and also i'm one of his underlings does
[02:50:10.000 --> 02:50:13.760]  something corrupt he doesn't know about it the underling rolls they impeach him i mean they're
[02:50:13.760 --> 02:50:20.480]  coming after him sure i just so this is going to be very dirty uh i had a number of of uh people
[02:50:20.480 --> 02:50:27.760]  that i helped uh uh work for to get into congress uh back in the time when newt gingrich went in
[02:50:27.760 --> 02:50:34.480]  the contract with america and they all said yes they were going to fight against him they would
[02:50:34.480 --> 02:50:42.480]  not i said well you really have to appoint good people to your staff because the the republican
[02:50:42.480 --> 02:50:49.040]  establishment will come to you and say you need to have our people in there and all four of the
[02:50:49.040 --> 02:50:53.920]  people that swore to me they were going to put good people in ended up taking all of because

[02:54:30.960 --> 02:54:34.240]  you see a lot of fake middle-class people have a nice car in a nice house and they
[02:54:34.240 --> 02:54:37.600]  they look down everybody as well when I see people down and out it makes me feel bad
[02:54:38.720 --> 02:54:43.280]  and I guess call me a bleeding heart whatever my parents I was a kid I was like can we please not
[02:54:43.280 --> 02:54:48.160]  spend Christmas Eve or Christmas day at the at the Salvation Army in downtown Dallas with a bunch
[02:54:48.160 --> 02:54:52.400]  of hobos with crap running down their legs and my parents would say that's why you're lucky that
[02:54:52.400 --> 02:54:56.000]  we're upper middle class and have things good this is what life's like now let's go to the hospital
[02:54:56.000 --> 02:55:00.400]  and visit paralyzed children and I guess I need to do that to my kids because they're great but
[02:55:00.400 --> 02:55:04.400]  they're spoiled compared to the way I was quite frankly I'm not down there at the homeless shelters
[02:55:04.400 --> 02:55:08.640]  I mean I do stuff like meals on wheels and stuff I think so much of this is most of the protesters
[02:55:08.640 --> 02:55:14.480]  got arrested in Portland turned out didn't even vote and turn out they were hired folks of course
[02:55:14.480 --> 02:55:19.120]  and they're so racist they're so dumb I gotta be honest I don't know if you can help them
[02:55:19.680 --> 02:55:25.760]  because I've been around the KKK protesting them stuff it's the exact same trashy scumminess that
[02:55:25.760 --> 02:55:30.480]  I see in those white people I see in the white people black people in Hispanics that are out
[02:55:30.480 --> 02:55:34.720]  lying about Trump and they're gonna try to discredit the nationalist movement saying it's racist to
[02:55:34.720 --> 02:55:39.680]  have a nation and not be run by foreign banks it's a joke we all shouldn't want to be run by the
[02:55:39.680 --> 02:55:46.560]  roast ruthless banks in the world William F. Jasper new American magazine I believe that we're
[02:55:46.560 --> 02:55:50.560]  coming from behind I believe we have a chance to win we have a beachhead in Washington Trump's
[02:55:50.560 --> 02:55:55.440]  party discredited the media the pollsters the system this is my secret weapon and I have the
[02:55:55.440 --> 02:56:01.600]  numbers here we pull them up where my phone go I had it earlier that huge amounts in the Senate
[02:56:01.600 --> 02:56:06.240]  the House a bunch of governors 900 plus seats legislature movement if we jump on the Trump
[02:56:06.240 --> 02:56:11.680]  bandwagon which we created and just get our people in on nationalism behind him the next two years
[02:56:12.400 --> 02:56:16.560]  not even hoping he does the right thing I hope he does I think what you were getting at his
[02:56:16.560 --> 02:56:22.000]  checkmate to make sure we get enough patriots in that understand the real paradigm that it will
[02:56:22.000 --> 02:56:25.760]  then be game over no matter what comes in the future don't you think that's probably the best
[02:56:25.760 --> 02:56:33.040]  time spent well yes and and you know everybody focuses on the presidency every four years and
[02:56:33.040 --> 02:56:39.200]  that's an easy thing to do and it seems like it's a quick fix because we'll just hire this one guy
[02:56:39.200 --> 02:56:44.400]  on a white horse and he'll come in and fix everything but it isn't that easy and it and I
[02:56:44.400 --> 02:56:53.280]  think most people who have gotten behind Trump realize that that we have a huge huge challenge
[02:56:53.280 --> 02:57:01.680]  ahead of us and it's coming at us in many different ways economically militarily our military has
[02:57:01.680 --> 02:57:08.880]  been hollowed out our manufacturing base all these things we can do we can make some major
[02:57:08.880 --> 02:57:16.000]  changes in those things but unless we get some help at the congressional level and at the state
[02:57:16.000 --> 02:57:22.160]  legislatures and the governorships etc our local government and this is where I hope that
[02:57:22.160 --> 02:57:30.800]  president trump will be a visionary in helping to build the base here I agree that's the real move
[02:57:30.800 --> 02:57:36.160]  and under president obama democrats have lost 900 state legislature seats 12 governors 69 house
[02:57:36.160 --> 02:57:42.240]  seats 13 senate seats that's some legacy I mean doesn't this then willing to ask for
[02:57:42.240 --> 02:57:47.520]  it isn't this the biggest impudiation of globalism ever with brexit with russia pulling out of it
[02:57:47.520 --> 02:57:53.440]  I mean I would say we're on the march the empire is on the run well the brexit was a was a huge
[02:57:53.440 --> 02:58:01.280]  huge thing we talked about that the last time and this is where it was quite delicious to to
[02:58:01.280 --> 02:58:09.760]  watch the major media all of the establishment globalists just going into meltdown mode over
[02:58:09.760 --> 02:58:18.160]  the brexit loss and now doing the same thing at a magnitude much larger over this this loss here
[02:58:18.160 --> 02:58:26.800]  for them their loss is our game so we have to make the most of this we're in a a huge battle
[02:58:26.800 --> 02:58:33.520]  we're in a cultural battle a spiritual battle an educational battle financial battle and it's
[02:58:33.520 --> 02:58:38.080]  it's something that's been building for a long time absolutely we're completely surrounded that's

[03:00:22.560 --> 03:00:26.480]  i knew their attack would be trump isn't delivering on everything 65 days before he's in
[03:00:26.480 --> 03:00:32.000]  office and he's i'm gonna trust him until he gets in i'm already seeing regsit expanded i'm
[03:00:32.000 --> 03:00:36.560]  already seeing tpp in trouble uh like they say dad i'm already seeing him say we're going up the
[03:00:36.560 --> 03:00:42.800]  carbon taxes the power plants turn back on i'm already seeing massive victories supreme court
[03:00:42.800 --> 03:00:47.840]  justices they're going to be patriots that's my litmus test if trump starts going and appointing
[03:00:47.840 --> 03:00:53.520]  bad justices that aren't strict constructionist the constitution and the list he put out was
[03:00:53.520 --> 03:00:57.600]  pretty darn good then i'll be upset but no he's delivering they're scared they're freaking out
[03:00:57.600 --> 03:01:03.040]  they're they're hitting on all all all all angles right now and lou dobbs has come out and really
[03:01:03.040 --> 03:01:08.480]  warned him don't get close to paul ryan now trump may think he can dominate paul ryan but paul ryan's
[03:01:08.480 --> 03:01:13.440]  already stabbed in the back so many times uh trumps gonna wait till paul ryan tries to sabotage
[03:01:13.440 --> 03:01:19.840]  him again and then have the house move to remove him know that trumps gotta wait till he gets in
[03:01:20.560 --> 03:01:25.840]  he's got 65 days folks he's gotta sit there while they attack him and then try to be presidential so
[03:01:26.400 --> 03:01:29.840]  let's let the let's not let him throw the baby out with the bathwater here's lou dobbs
[03:01:29.840 --> 03:01:35.680]  thoughts on a curious direction taken in our national swamp you know the one that president
[03:01:35.680 --> 03:01:42.640]  elect promised to drain and a dangerous dangerous course it seems to be all is now set to hold
[03:01:42.640 --> 03:01:47.440]  house leadership elections tomorrow speaker paul ryan running unopposed for reelection
[03:01:47.440 --> 03:01:52.640]  this is the same ryan who was working more closely with president obama than his own
[03:01:52.640 --> 03:01:59.120]  conference who dare i mention this who betrayed his party's nominee for president ryan after all
[03:01:59.120 --> 03:02:05.200]  was on a losing not winning republican ticket just four years ago and he was crushed in a debate
[03:02:05.200 --> 03:02:12.960]  that year by none other than joe biden this is the same over full hamlet who took a month to
[03:02:12.960 --> 03:02:18.160]  endorse trump after he became the presumptive nominee who said he had a quote obligation
[03:02:18.160 --> 03:02:24.880]  to call out trump he slammed trump attacked his immigration proposals ryan criticized and deferred
[03:02:24.880 --> 03:02:31.520]  and never once advocated for trump it was one week ago last monday that he said to a radio talk show
[03:02:31.520 --> 03:02:37.760]  host quote no one person controls this party when he should have been speaking for the top of the
[03:02:37.760 --> 03:02:44.000]  ticket i think it's clear ryan believed trump would lose the election ryan kept waving his
[03:02:44.000 --> 03:02:52.960]  silly better wage into pamphlet around not not the trump uh proposals not the party's platform
[03:02:52.960 --> 03:02:59.280]  ryan reminds me of the story trump told throughout his campaign snake he quoted the poem about a
[03:02:59.280 --> 03:03:07.120]  woman taking in an ailing snake now she stroked his pretty skin and then she kissed him and held
[03:03:07.120 --> 03:03:18.880]  him tight but instead of saying thank you that snake gave her a vicious bite oh shut up silly
[03:03:18.880 --> 03:03:28.800]  woman said the reptile with a grin you knew damn well i was a snake you knew everything about me
[03:03:29.600 --> 03:03:38.320]  before you took me in and indeed we do ryan is made clear to all to his fellow republicans to the
[03:03:38.320 --> 03:03:46.960]  nation what he is what he's capable of and who he is and there's no cure for that i sure do hope
[03:03:46.960 --> 03:03:52.160]  i'm wrong about all this i just don't have any evidence whatsoever that i am that's right the
[03:03:52.160 --> 03:03:59.600]  rest of it is up to ryan we'll see that's right uh trump is playing presidential while they
[03:03:59.600 --> 03:04:04.800]  attack him from every angle ryan is out sniveling around and attacking him from behind and ludobbs
[03:04:04.800 --> 03:04:09.760]  is the very best broadcaster journalist in the media today the hands down for just being a
[03:04:09.760 --> 03:04:14.480]  journalist and a broadcaster for smarts it's ludobbs he's a big listener fox doesn't let
[03:04:14.480 --> 03:04:18.720]  him come on the show i'll just tell you that i guess tucker carlson got in trouble for coming on
[03:04:18.720 --> 03:04:23.040]  they said don't do that anymore like like like i need them on the show i'm trying to support
[03:04:23.040 --> 03:04:28.400]  good people on your on your platform they're trying to purge topolitano people like ludobbs
[03:04:28.400 --> 03:04:33.680]  they put them over on the business channel uh you know this is what they do and and i'm telling you
[03:04:33.680 --> 03:04:37.120]  those guys ever get their own platform like this i mean if those guys had a platform like this they'd
[03:04:37.120 --> 03:04:40.960]  be as big as i am maybe i should fly them down here sometimes just show them how big we are with
[03:04:40.960 --> 03:04:44.560]  the actual numbers like hey that was 85 million viewers last week when we think about that it's
[03:04:44.560 --> 03:04:48.240]  a lot bigger than fox didn't they'd be like whoa how is that possible i know it's all impers new
[03:04:48.240 --> 03:04:53.200]  clothes it's all just fantasy land we've already won folks why do you think nationalism is sweeping
[03:04:53.200 --> 03:05:13.680]  the world it's because of drudgereport.com and info wars.com and breitbart.com and paul watson
[03:05:24.080 --> 03:05:28.400]  when asked about rumors that hillary was drunk on election night kincannon responded she was
[03:05:28.400 --> 03:05:33.360]  i posted about that too she was in a psychotic drunken rage according to my reporter friend
[03:05:33.360 --> 03:05:38.080]  doctor added sedatives to the mix kincannon then claimed that cnn blocked a reporter from
[03:05:38.080 --> 03:05:43.200]  publishing what would have been a bombshell story the cnn reporter didn't fail to report it
[03:05:43.200 --> 03:05:48.560]  his editors will not let him cnn has banned all hillary in the bunker stories he tweeted secret
[03:05:48.560 --> 03:05:52.800]  service officials and other staff who work closely alongside hillary have previously reported her

[03:06:09.040 --> 03:06:14.960]  deficiencies can devastate iq and how the government knowingly started taking iodine out of the food
[03:06:14.960 --> 03:06:20.160]  and adding fluorine the bad member of the halogen family into the water they took the good halogen
[03:06:20.160 --> 03:06:25.680]  out and put the deadly halogen in and when the fukushima crisis worsened as it still is worsening

[03:11:38.680 --> 03:12:04.680]  I'm not expecting you to not get dirty swaps.
[03:12:04.680 --> 03:12:33.680]  I'm not expecting you to not get dirty swaps.
[03:12:33.680 --> 03:13:01.680]  I'm not expecting you to not get dirty swaps.
[03:13:01.680 --> 03:13:29.680]  I'm not expecting you to not get dirty swaps.
[03:13:29.680 --> 03:13:58.680]  I'm not expecting you to not get dirty swaps.
[03:13:58.680 --> 03:14:27.680]  I'm not expecting you to not get dirty swaps.
[03:14:27.680 --> 03:14:56.680]  I'm not expecting you to not get dirty swaps.
[03:14:56.680 --> 03:15:25.680]  I'm not expecting you to not get dirty swaps.
[03:15:25.680 --> 03:15:54.680]  I'm not expecting you to not get dirty swaps.
[03:15:54.680 --> 03:16:23.680]  I'm not expecting you to not get dirty swaps.
[03:16:23.680 --> 03:16:50.680]  I'm not expecting you to not get dirty swaps.
[03:16:50.680 --> 03:17:18.680]  I'm not expecting you to not get dirty swaps.
[03:17:18.680 --> 03:17:26.680]  So the mere rumour of a hate crime was incorporated into all these hate crime figures and then the media claimed that hate crimes were through the roof.
[03:17:26.680 --> 03:17:29.680]  Again, we see the exact same process.
[03:17:29.680 --> 03:17:40.680]  You've got the SPLC, the Southern Poverty Law Center, which of course is a complete Democrat front, completely controlled group, asking people to report so-called hate crimes.
[03:17:40.680 --> 03:17:51.680]  Well, I reported a hate crime to the SPLC, a Trump supporter being beaten up by a mob in Chicago because they claimed he supported Trump.
[03:17:51.680 --> 03:17:53.680]  They didn't even know that you voted for Trump at the time.
[03:17:53.680 --> 03:17:54.680]  It turns out he did.
[03:17:54.680 --> 03:18:04.680]  They didn't know that at the time, beating him to a pulp, dragging him in a car, literally looked like a lynching what you would see happen to black people back, you know, 100 years ago.
[03:18:04.680 --> 03:18:18.680]  I reported that as a hate crime because it obviously was. That's why I got put in this mashable article saying that I advocated mass murder because I'm tweeting a joke tweet.
[03:18:18.680 --> 03:18:19.680]  It wasn't even a joke tweet.
[03:18:19.680 --> 03:18:26.680]  It was a serious tweet by somebody who said that they were concerned Donald Trump would mass murder disabled people.
[03:18:26.680 --> 03:18:29.680]  I tweeted it and said, look, this is hilarious.
[03:18:29.680 --> 03:18:39.680]  This person actually thinks this. And then they said that that constituted me, quote, advocating for mass murder in the aftermath of the election.
[03:18:39.680 --> 03:18:53.680]  That's not only sloppy journalism. That's libelous. They corrected it within hours after I complained to them and then added a ridiculous retraction at the bottom, which in fact, they had to dilute even further.
[03:18:53.680 --> 03:19:00.680]  Editors know this is on the mashable article. Alt-right Twitter is emboldened and not going away.
[03:19:00.680 --> 03:19:03.680]  This is the bottom of the article. You can see it there.
[03:19:03.680 --> 03:19:08.680]  An earlier version of this story took a tweet from user Paul Joseph Watson out of context.
[03:19:08.680 --> 03:19:13.680]  Watson has clarified his views and we regret the error. The story has since been amended.
[03:19:13.680 --> 03:19:34.680]  Tuck it out of context. You said that I was advocating mass murder. I mean, for God's sake, what kind of idiot wrote this article knowing that that's basically all I do on Twitter every day is take the hysterical overreactions of leftist and shine a light on it and shine a mirror on it and say, look, this is ludicrous.
[03:19:34.680 --> 03:19:39.680]  Of course, Donald Trump is not going to gas disabled people like Hitler.
[03:19:39.680 --> 03:19:44.680]  And by the time that gets into the mainstream media, I'm advocating mass murder.
[03:19:44.680 --> 03:19:48.680]  Well, no, that's completely ridiculous. And that's why nobody trusts you.
[03:19:48.680 --> 03:19:55.680]  But again, we'll get into it after the break. They still haven't fully retracted on it and more big news coming up.
[03:19:55.680 --> 03:20:10.680]  This is the Alex Jones Show Live. We'll be right back. Stay tuned.

[03:24:12.680 --> 03:24:22.680]  This is the headline up on Mashable.com. They've changed it. They've made the headline more hardcore because they had to water down the article because it was basically libelous.
[03:24:22.680 --> 03:24:33.680]  The empowered alt-right trolls have created a cesspit on Twitter. Oh really, that's funny because whenever I go on Twitter, it's leftist threatening to assassinate Donald Trump.
[03:24:33.680 --> 03:24:46.680]  We've posted those tweets many times. In fact, I've just made a video which is literally six minutes solid. Most of it is death threats posted by leftists on Twitter threatening to assassinate Donald Trump.
[03:24:46.680 --> 03:25:03.680]  Yeah, you're going to have racists in the alt-right, but the only people who've actually made Twitter a cesspit, and in fact now Twitter has increased its censorship because of that, the only people who have made Twitter a cesspit is leftists with their violent hateful racist threats, which they now specialize in.
[03:25:03.680 --> 03:25:16.680]  But this was the original quote on this Mashable article. They said, Paul Joseph Watson, the editor-at-large of conspiracy theorist website Infowars, who has a Twitter following of 345,000 users.
[03:25:16.680 --> 03:25:23.680]  It's actually 357,000. He can't even count this idiot who wrote this article. What's his name? Let's get his name.
[03:25:23.680 --> 03:25:34.680]  Pauline Daylidder can't even count for one. He has a Twitter following of wrong amount of Twitter users advocated for mass murder in the aftermath of the election.
[03:25:34.680 --> 03:25:44.680]  His proof that I advocated for mass murder was me posting a tweet by somebody else who was concerned about mass murder. I said, look, this is silly.
[03:25:44.680 --> 03:26:01.680]  Donald Trump is going to gas-disable people. Obviously, a joke. He's not going to gas-disable people. The original tweet was a concern against mass murder, yet they used it to say that I was encouraging, I was advocating mass murder.
[03:26:01.680 --> 03:26:11.680]  This is why no one trusts the mainstream media. This is why you lost. This is why your narrative is failing. This is why you're going out of business because you lie, you deceive.
[03:26:11.680 --> 03:26:28.680]  They since changed it. Let me get the exact quote. They put the retraction at the bottom. They then changed the article to say, Anglin, that's somebody else, Andrew Anglin, is far from the only person who is scoffed at the idea that hate might now be emboldened.
[03:26:28.680 --> 03:26:41.680]  Paul Joseph Watson, and then it goes on to say I shared this tweet. So I'm scoffing at the idea that hate might now be emboldened. Meanwhile, all the real hate is being directed towards Donald Trump and his supporters.
[03:26:41.680 --> 03:26:56.680]  We had the video out of Chicago, the Trump voter being attacked, beaten to a pulp, dragged in a vehicle. We had the girl in high school in California being beaten up by her classmates because she posted some pro-Trump image on Instagram.
[03:26:56.680 --> 03:27:10.680]  We've had death threats. In fact, we've had another death threat against Donald Trump today. We've had film directors. We've had other famous people. We've had a CEO of a major company who's had to resign because he directly threatened to kill Donald Trump.
[03:27:10.680 --> 03:27:30.680]  Okay, we had hateful, violent behavior towards Donald Trump supporters throughout the entirety of the year, proven to be funded by the DNC as James O'Keefe exposed. But no, none of that is happening. It's me that's emboldening hate because I post a tweet by somebody saying,
[03:27:30.680 --> 03:27:42.680]  Donald Trump is going to gas disabled people and say that's ridiculous. Absolutely ludicrous. But what do you expect from the discredited, debunked, rigged mainstream media?
[03:27:42.680 --> 03:27:51.680]  Meanwhile, Donald Sutherland says he's ashamed of being a white male and has lost all hope after Trump's victory. Let's go to this clip.
[03:27:51.680 --> 03:28:03.680]  Helen Miran came up to me on a set. She said, you are the most privileged person on earth. I said, how can you say that? And she said, you are a white male.
[03:28:03.680 --> 03:28:06.680]  And your reply to that was?
[03:28:06.680 --> 03:28:32.680]  There's no reply. I was ashamed. I was stunned. And I have gotten more ashamed. It's interesting to realize that you are seen as an integral part of a group that many of whom are mendacious, misogynist, bigots, racists. And it's appalling.
[03:28:32.680 --> 03:28:37.680]  For grandchildren, what do you tell them to give them a hopeful view of life?
[03:28:37.680 --> 03:28:46.680]  How can I give them a hopeful view? Now, how can I give them a hopeful view? I have a wife. I have a daughter. I have a daughter-in-law and a granddaughter.
[03:28:46.680 --> 03:28:59.680]  What do I say to them? What do I say to them? Their women's rights have gone. The environment has gone. Minimum pay has gone. What do I say to them?
[03:28:59.680 --> 03:29:06.680]  How do I, you know, I can only say one thing. I am a Canadian.
[03:29:06.680 --> 03:29:15.680]  There's Donald Sutherland saying that because Trump's now in office, he isn't even in office yet because he's president-elect, women's rights are gone.
[03:29:15.680 --> 03:29:23.680]  Really, has Donald Trump already revoked women's rights to vote? He's saying the environment's gone. Donald Trump's literally already destroyed the earth.
[03:29:23.680 --> 03:29:33.680]  He's not going to give up. But, of course, the main theme of that is he's ashamed for being a white male because Helen Mirren told him it was really bad.
[03:29:33.680 --> 03:29:44.680]  Again, reinforcing the fact that the last acceptable form of racism is racism against white people. The last acceptable form of bigotry is bigotry against white men.
[03:29:44.680 --> 03:29:49.680]  And Donald Sutherland is continuing that ridiculous narrative. We'll be back. Stay tuned.
[03:29:49.680 --> 03:29:56.680]  March. The Empires on the Run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:19.680 --> 03:30:25.680]  Provided by police were then compared to state voter logs by Multnomath County elections officials.
[03:30:25.680 --> 03:30:30.680]  Records show 34 of the protesters arrested didn't turn in a ballot for the November 8th election.
[03:30:30.680 --> 03:30:34.680]  35 of the demonstrators taken into custody weren't even registered to vote.
[03:30:34.680 --> 03:30:37.680]  And yet they're out there bitching about Donald Trump.
[03:30:37.680 --> 03:30:44.680]  They're so upset that Donald Trump's going to destroy America, but they couldn't even take the time to register to vote or even go out and vote.
[03:30:44.680 --> 03:30:49.680]  G.W. is still working to verify voting records of the remaining 17 protesters who were arrested.
[03:30:49.680 --> 03:30:53.680]  People always want to bitch about something and they're too lazy to go out themselves and make change.
[03:30:53.680 --> 03:30:59.680]  This has been Joe Biggs with Infowars.com and guess what? Trump supporters showed up in record numbers. Boo-yah!

[03:31:31.680 --> 03:31:35.680]  We've seen example after example of cable news networks attempting to deceive you.
[03:31:35.680 --> 03:31:40.680]  In short, the mainstream media is being covertly manipulated by well-financed political forces who are trying to sway public opinion
[03:31:40.680 --> 03:31:44.680]  in a natural direction that only serves establishment agendas.
[03:31:44.680 --> 03:31:49.680]  But Infowars Live is the solution to the controlled press that is rapidly losing influence.

[03:32:20.680 --> 03:32:23.680]  Telemires are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes.
[03:32:23.680 --> 03:32:25.680]  And when it runs out, you start dying.
[03:32:25.680 --> 03:32:29.680]  We chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different clinical trials.
[03:32:29.680 --> 03:32:32.680]  It's one of the most effective substances in the world.
[03:32:32.680 --> 03:32:37.680]  It works like an antioxidant. It works to repair nerve growth factor.
[03:32:37.680 --> 03:32:41.680]  So this is a formula to deliver the maximum amount. It's in powder form.
[03:32:41.680 --> 03:32:46.680]  We have so many five-star reviews. I take this. This is the product that I take.

[03:33:22.680 --> 03:33:25.680]  We're live at the fourth hour of the Alex Jones show.
[03:33:25.680 --> 03:33:30.680]  Before we delve back into the news, I want to tell you about some of the great products we have.
[03:33:30.680 --> 03:33:37.680]  Available at InfowarsLive.com. We have Biopca, the ultimate new hair, skin and nails formula.
[03:33:37.680 --> 03:33:44.680]  For years, listeners have been asking us to create a game-changing formula that works to give your hair, skin and nails the compounds that they really need.
[03:33:44.680 --> 03:33:50.680]  No matter how hard we try, every single day we expose ourselves to toxic chemicals that wreaking havoc on our skin and hair.
[03:33:50.680 --> 03:33:58.680]  Biopca is specifically formulated to help give your hair, skin and nails a healthy appearance and fight back against that toxic environment.
[03:33:58.680 --> 03:34:11.680]  You've heard Anthony Gucciotti and Alex talk about it. We don't settle for second best and that's why we've got the independent five-star reviews on basically all our products including Biopca.
[03:34:11.680 --> 03:34:22.680]  We also have the Trump Is My President shirt for just $9.95. Again, this is a new t-shirt but we're making it available for just $9.95.
[03:34:22.680 --> 03:34:33.680]  Again, this huge temper tantrum by children across America grown up, adult babies whining in their diapers saying that Donald Trump is not their president.
[03:34:33.680 --> 03:34:43.680]  Fight back, win back that narrative by getting the president-elect Donald Trump t-shirt. Trump is my president for just $9.95.
[03:34:43.680 --> 03:34:46.680]  Again, this is a lost leader. We're not making any money on this.
[03:34:46.680 --> 03:34:58.680]  But this is again to reinforce the message that as we move towards December 19th and this Electoral College vote, which they're still trying to derail, believe it or not, this reinforces the message.
[03:34:58.680 --> 03:35:04.680]  This wins the narrative. That is the Trump Is My President shirt for just $9.95.
[03:35:04.680 --> 03:35:06.680]  Our info was store.com.
[03:35:06.680 --> 03:35:17.680]  Let's get back into the news before the break. We had Donald Sutherland apologizing for his white guilt for his skin color because again, the last acceptable form of racism is racism against white people.
[03:35:17.680 --> 03:35:30.680]  And that's supposedly our privilege to be racist, to be made racist every single day merely because of our skin color. We have the privilege to be called racist on a regular basis.
[03:35:30.680 --> 03:35:38.680]  Again, bigotry, last acceptable form of bigotry is bigotry against white men. You see that throughout the leftist media.
[03:35:38.680 --> 03:35:47.680]  And now we have this video, which is up on americanmirror.com. Clinton campaign blamed white women for defeat.
[03:35:47.680 --> 03:35:51.680]  More bigotry of low expectations from the left.
[03:35:51.680 --> 03:35:56.680]  Move over, James Comey. Hillary Clinton's campaign has a new culprit for its loss to Donald Trump.
[03:35:56.680 --> 03:36:01.680]  Self-loathing sexist women during an appearance on MSNBC on Monday.
[03:36:01.680 --> 03:36:11.680]  Former Clinton campaign communications director Jess McIntosh claimed that it was women with internalized misogyny who couldn't bring themselves to vote to elect the first woman president.
[03:36:11.680 --> 03:36:13.680]  Let's go to this clip.
[03:36:13.680 --> 03:36:32.680]  My understanding from my conversations with the Clinton folks is that there's a certain demographic, everyone sort of comes up with their demographic pattern of victory, and in some ways the demographic bet was there's going to be some demographics on which she underperforms, that will be made up for ones on which she overperforms.
[03:36:32.680 --> 03:36:47.680]  We should be clear women of color overwhelmingly voted for her and have overwhelmingly voted for every democratic president for candidate. But she, among white women, didn't do any different than essentially Obama in 2012.
[03:36:47.680 --> 03:36:50.680]  A point better. How do you make sense of that?
[03:36:50.680 --> 03:37:07.680]  I mean, internalized misogyny is a real thing, and this is a thing that we have to be talking about as we go through and see. My guess is, the president said at the best during this whole campaign, we as a society react poorly to women seeking positions of power.
[03:37:07.680 --> 03:37:15.680]  We are uncomfortable at it, and then we seek to justify that uncomfortable feeling, because it can't possibly be because we don't want to see a woman in that position of power.
[03:37:15.680 --> 03:37:25.680]  We need to, as we go through these numbers, as we figure out exactly what happened with turnout, it seems to be white college educated women. My guess is that breaks down, married, unmarried.
[03:37:25.680 --> 03:37:37.680]  My guess is it breaks down older, younger. But we have work to do talking to those women about what happened this year, and why we would vote against our self interests.
[03:37:37.680 --> 03:37:50.680]  So again, they're saying that internalized misogyny is because that's the reason why women voted for Trump. Well, now, internalized misogyny really means women being able to think for themselves.
[03:37:50.680 --> 03:37:59.680]  They're basically saying that women who don't agree with us with our narrative that Hillary Clinton, because she has a vagina, deserves to be the president.
[03:37:59.680 --> 03:38:07.680]  That's then if you don't agree with that, you're weak, you're brainwashed. Again, this is the left's bigger tree of low expectations.
[03:38:07.680 --> 03:38:18.680]  Any woman who doesn't carry the can for them, any woman who doesn't buy into their ridiculous debunked narrative has internalized misogyny. She can't think for herself.
[03:38:18.680 --> 03:38:29.680]  And again, the most rampant and hateful misogyny is always, always reserved for conservative and Republican women. Look at how they treated Sarah Palin.
[03:38:29.680 --> 03:38:41.680]  Look at how they treat Ann Coulter, the most vile, horrific slurs reserved for women like Ann Coulter, because they're conservatives.
[03:38:41.680 --> 03:38:51.680]  You know, maybe women who voted for Trump could actually see past your lame cliches about Hillary being this women's rights champion.
[03:38:51.680 --> 03:39:02.680]  Have you ever considered for a second that that's why they voted for her? Have you ever considered that they knew that they actually had the mental capacity to do the research
[03:39:02.680 --> 03:39:11.680]  and find out that Hillary Clinton laughed at knowing a child molester that she defended was guilty?
[03:39:11.680 --> 03:39:19.680]  A man who molested a young girl 12 years old. Is that the big feminist candidate that all women should have voted for?
[03:39:19.680 --> 03:39:28.680]  Or they had internalized misogyny. You know, maybe they looked into the fact that 20% of Hillary's campaign was funded by Saudi Arabia,
[03:39:28.680 --> 03:39:36.680]  a country that treats women little better than farmyard animals. How's that for your women's rights champion?
[03:39:36.680 --> 03:39:49.680]  Maybe they looked into the fact that Bill Clinton got a $1 million birthday check from Qatar, a country in which it's still legal for a husband to beat and rape his wife.
[03:39:49.680 --> 03:40:02.680]  That sounds really feminist, doesn't it? Maybe women had the mental capacity to know those facts and that that's why they didn't believe your crap that Hillary Clinton was the feminist candidate,
[03:40:02.680 --> 03:40:15.680]  was the women's rights champion. Maybe you're not giving them the credit that they deserved and internalized misogyny actually means women, God forbid, being able to think for themselves.
[03:40:15.680 --> 03:40:25.680]  Another article. This is upon Breitbart. Jake Tapper triggered after GOP represents video of Black Marb attacking white Trump voter.
[03:40:25.680 --> 03:40:35.680]  Former GOP Congressman Jack Kingston triggered CNN's Jake Tapper Monday by pointing out Trump supporters are the only ones actually being violently attacked in the wake of the election.
[03:40:35.680 --> 03:40:45.680]  So he basically pointed out this video, which we featured, which went absolutely viral, of the mob in Chicago attacking this man because he voted for Donald Trump.
[03:40:45.680 --> 03:40:53.680]  They didn't even know it at the time, but it turns out he did. And again, Kingston, this Congressman, pointed out the race of the assailants,
[03:40:53.680 --> 03:41:00.680]  because again, the whole narrative is about, oh, these horrible white people voted Donald Trump into power.
[03:41:00.680 --> 03:41:07.680]  So then they bring up this fake narrative of the supposed hate crime wave being carried out by Donald Trump supporters against minorities.
[03:41:07.680 --> 03:41:16.680]  Congressman Kingston gets up there and says, well, look, all the examples that I've seen are Trump voters being the victims of hate crimes.
[03:41:16.680 --> 03:41:22.680]  And in this case, obviously it was racially motivated, but Tapper can't even stand that.
[03:41:22.680 --> 03:41:26.680]  He says, why does it matter the race of the people that beat him up?
[03:41:26.680 --> 03:41:34.680]  Kingston responds because that's what the topic is here, just to quote, and he's quoting them, xenophobia, homophobia, racist and sexist.
[03:41:34.680 --> 03:41:42.680]  That's what we talked about in the last hour. So again, it's okay to repeat over and over again that whites are responsible for voting in Trump,
[03:41:42.680 --> 03:41:50.680]  but merely to mention the race of a mob of thugs involved in an actual hate crime, that's despicable.
[03:41:50.680 --> 03:42:01.680]  Tapper, Jake Tapper was more offended by the congressman mentioning the race of this mob of thugs than he was the actual hate crime.
[03:42:01.680 --> 03:42:06.680]  And again, that gets to the heart of this narrative that we're hearing in the aftermath of the election.
[03:42:06.680 --> 03:42:09.680]  Case after case, we feature them every single day.
[03:42:09.680 --> 03:42:18.680]  Trump supporters being viciously attacked and abused the victims of politically motivated, in some cases, racially motivated hate crimes.
[03:42:18.680 --> 03:42:26.680]  Meanwhile, Leslie Stahl gets up on CVS and says to Trump, oh, what about all these horrible attacks by your supporters against Muslims and Latinos?
[03:42:26.680 --> 03:42:31.680]  Which are not actually happening. In fact, there was a supposed hate crime against a Muslim West.
[03:42:31.680 --> 03:42:35.680]  He jab got pulled. She was verbally abused by Trump supporters.
[03:42:35.680 --> 03:42:40.680]  The police investigated it and she had to admit that she made it all up.
[03:42:40.680 --> 03:42:51.680]  Because again, the left specializes in inventing fake hate crimes against itself while carrying out actual hate crimes against other people.
[03:42:51.680 --> 03:43:00.680]  And now you've got them wearing safety pins as a sign of expressing their fear that minorities are going to be attacked again.
[03:43:00.680 --> 03:43:04.680]  We saw the same BS after Brexit. It was completely contrived.
[03:43:04.680 --> 03:43:09.680]  And all the real threats are coming from leftists and anti-Trump people.
[03:43:09.680 --> 03:43:11.680]  And I'll give you another couple of examples.
[03:43:11.680 --> 03:43:14.680]  My goal is to assassinate Trump.
[03:43:14.680 --> 03:43:15.680]  That's a quote.
[03:43:15.680 --> 03:43:19.680]  Ohio man is first to be charged for sending threatening election night tweets.
[03:43:19.680 --> 03:43:21.680]  This is out of the Daily Mail.
[03:43:21.680 --> 03:43:30.680]  24 year old man from Ohio, tolerant leftist, has been charged in federal court after tweeting a threat to assassinate president-elect Donald Trump on election night.
[03:43:30.680 --> 03:43:33.680]  Because he's a tolerant, peaceful liberal.
[03:43:33.680 --> 03:43:41.680]  Zachary Benson from Cleveland posted the remark on Twitter a few minutes before the Republican nominee was declared the winner of last week's election.
[03:43:41.680 --> 03:43:44.680]  He was getting in his retaliation ahead of time.
[03:43:44.680 --> 03:43:48.680]  Benson tweeted, my life goal is to assassinate Trump.
[03:43:48.680 --> 03:43:52.680]  But again, it's Trump supporters who are hateful and violent.
[03:43:52.680 --> 03:43:54.680]  Let's just keep repeating that mantra.
[03:43:54.680 --> 03:44:02.680]  He went on to say, don't care if I serve infinite sentences, that man deserves to decease existing.
[03:44:02.680 --> 03:44:05.680]  So he can't even spell or type, but as you would expect.
[03:44:05.680 --> 03:44:10.680]  Seconds later, he tweeted, diplomacy effing fools, I hate you all.
[03:44:10.680 --> 03:44:15.680]  I want to bomb every one of your voting booths and your general areas.
[03:44:15.680 --> 03:44:19.680]  But again, it's Trump supporters who are hateful and violent.
[03:44:19.680 --> 03:44:21.680]  He was interviewed by the Secret Service.
[03:44:21.680 --> 03:44:23.680]  He was arrested.
[03:44:23.680 --> 03:44:28.680]  Which is interesting because these celebrities that make the same threats aren't being arrested.
[03:44:28.680 --> 03:44:35.680]  He had Paul Schrader, the big film director, openly called for violence to stop Donald Trump.
[03:44:35.680 --> 03:44:37.680]  Not just in a roundabout way.
[03:44:37.680 --> 03:44:40.680]  He said, I want to incite violence.
[03:44:40.680 --> 03:44:41.680]  Let's have violence.
[03:44:41.680 --> 03:44:43.680]  Again, nothing happens to him.
[03:44:43.680 --> 03:44:47.680]  A meanly mouthed apology removed the original post.
[03:44:47.680 --> 03:44:49.680]  And he's probably going to get away with it.
[03:44:49.680 --> 03:44:52.680]  There you see the article we had up on him for us yesterday.
[03:44:52.680 --> 03:44:54.680]  Here's another one.
[03:44:54.680 --> 03:44:55.680]  We've been following this story.
[03:44:55.680 --> 03:44:57.680]  This is out of the hill.
[03:44:57.680 --> 03:45:02.680]  Tech CEO resigns after death threats to Trump.
[03:45:02.680 --> 03:45:10.680]  The CEO of San Diego based technology company reportedly resigned Tuesday after death threats he made against president like Donald Trump went viral.
[03:45:10.680 --> 03:45:12.680]  Wonder why they went viral.
[03:45:12.680 --> 03:45:16.680]  Wasn't because that article was up on him for WARS.com as well, was it?
[03:45:16.680 --> 03:45:23.680]  I think it slides. Matt Harrigan posted multiple threats against Trump on Facebook, which later went viral according to a report in The Daily Beast.
[03:45:23.680 --> 03:45:26.680]  Well, I'm going to kill the president-elect.
[03:45:26.680 --> 03:45:28.680]  Bring it secret service.
[03:45:28.680 --> 03:45:32.680]  And of course, we featured another tweet in which he said, yeah, I've got a sniper rifle.
[03:45:32.680 --> 03:45:34.680]  I'm positioning myself.
[03:45:34.680 --> 03:45:37.680]  I'm going to kill the president-elect.
[03:45:37.680 --> 03:45:39.680]  But again, it's Trump supporters who are hateful.
[03:45:39.680 --> 03:45:45.680]  It's Trump supporters who are carrying out violent hate crimes against leftists according to CBS.
[03:45:45.680 --> 03:45:51.680]  According to the debunked, rigged, discredited mainstream media.
[03:45:51.680 --> 03:45:55.680]  Report anti-Trump protesters block ambulance father of four year old girl dies.
[03:45:55.680 --> 03:45:58.680]  We talked about that briefly earlier.
[03:45:58.680 --> 03:46:06.680]  Again, these are the tolerant liberals blocking ambulances, engaging in death threats, beating Trump voters to a pulp.
[03:46:06.680 --> 03:46:08.680]  The list goes on and on.
[03:46:08.680 --> 03:46:26.680]  But don't worry, because they're all wearing safety pins to show their support for the vulnerable and to express the fear that Trump supporters may physically or emotionally abuse minorities, immigrants, women, and members of the LGBT community.
[03:46:26.680 --> 03:46:27.680]  Wow.
[03:46:27.680 --> 03:46:31.680]  All the members of those communities who are Trump supporters, they're demeaned.
[03:46:31.680 --> 03:46:33.680]  They're called trash.
[03:46:33.680 --> 03:46:37.680]  You know, rape, malania signs are held up anti-Trump protests.
[03:46:37.680 --> 03:46:40.680]  They're being beaten to a pulp, according to the mainstream media.
[03:46:40.680 --> 03:46:43.680]  None of that even exists.
[03:46:43.680 --> 03:46:50.680]  Sweden, the liberal basket case that we talk about every week at this point.
[03:46:50.680 --> 03:46:55.680]  This is about the independent Swedish women to get hotline to report mansplaining.
[03:46:55.680 --> 03:46:56.680]  Oh, really?
[03:46:56.680 --> 03:47:00.680]  So they've got migrants raping women at music festivals every summer now.
[03:47:00.680 --> 03:47:08.680]  They've got people within the actual government on the immigration board posting their support for ISIS on Facebook.
[03:47:08.680 --> 03:47:13.680]  They've got 75% plus of rapes being carried out by immigrants.
[03:47:13.680 --> 03:47:16.680]  They've got murder rates skyrocketing through the roof.
[03:47:16.680 --> 03:47:18.680]  And what's their solution?
[03:47:18.680 --> 03:47:25.680]  It's to give women in the workplace a telephone hotline if they're offended about mansplaining.
[03:47:25.680 --> 03:47:27.680]  Okay.
[03:47:27.680 --> 03:47:30.680]  This is what America narrowly avoided last week.
[03:47:30.680 --> 03:47:33.680]  This is the direction that they avoided going in.
[03:47:33.680 --> 03:47:39.680]  Women who have things mansplained to them in the workplace can now report it to a dedicated hotline.
[03:47:39.680 --> 03:47:46.680]  In other words, men who have the temerity to have an opinion which may differ from triglypuff fat feminists.
[03:47:46.680 --> 03:47:50.680]  They've got a hotline now if they get offended.
[03:47:50.680 --> 03:47:57.680]  Sweden's largest union is encouraging members to call up when male colleagues give them unsolicited lectures on things that they already understand.
[03:47:57.680 --> 03:48:03.680]  So again, any kind of knowledge being imparted, any kind of opinion, we can't have that.
[03:48:03.680 --> 03:48:04.680]  Call the hotline.
[03:48:04.680 --> 03:48:09.680]  Report the hate criminal while they're being raped at music festivals, but we don't really care about that.
[03:48:09.680 --> 03:48:13.680]  Because those men have brown skin and that's acceptable behavior.
[03:48:13.680 --> 03:48:16.680]  This was one of the comments on the independent article.
[03:48:16.680 --> 03:48:18.680]  Cool.
[03:48:18.680 --> 03:48:21.680]  How soon can we get a nagging hotline established?
[03:48:21.680 --> 03:48:24.680]  This is a very serious drain on men's productivity.
[03:48:24.680 --> 03:48:31.680]  And I bet the incidents of nagging are probably 10 to 1 compared to mansplaining, which isn't even a real thing.
[03:48:31.680 --> 03:48:38.680]  So Sweden is dealing with the fact that 80%, 75% of its rapes now are committed by migrants,
[03:48:38.680 --> 03:48:47.680]  by importing more migrants and giving women a telephone hotline to complain if they're offended about a man in the workplace having an opinion.
[03:48:47.680 --> 03:48:51.680]  And that's why Sweden as a country is dying.
[03:48:51.680 --> 03:48:52.680]  Okay, moving on.
[03:48:52.680 --> 03:48:57.680]  Twitter finally answers critics adding tools to curb abuse and harassment.
[03:48:57.680 --> 03:48:59.680]  This is out of Bloomberg.
[03:48:59.680 --> 03:49:01.680]  Basically, what's happened?
[03:49:01.680 --> 03:49:15.680]  Twitter has added a word filter where permanently outraged morons can filter out words that trigger them that cause them to retreat to their safe spaces by typing them in to their settings.
[03:49:15.680 --> 03:49:24.680]  Now, I guess for social justice warriors, that list of banned words that trigger them will include fact and logic.
[03:49:24.680 --> 03:49:27.680]  But again, this is how Twitter is dealing with harassment.
[03:49:27.680 --> 03:49:31.680]  They've also introduced another policy, which is here in this article.
[03:49:31.680 --> 03:49:41.680]  For anyone who spots language that violates the company's policy, there's a new option to report hateful conduct in addition to abuse and harassment.
[03:49:41.680 --> 03:49:45.680]  Hateful conduct meaning anyone who has a different opinion.
[03:49:45.680 --> 03:49:49.680]  Milo got banned for criticizing a Ghostbusters movie.
[03:49:49.680 --> 03:49:58.680]  Again, people have been banned for retweeting or responding to or disagreeing with a Triglypoth.
[03:49:58.680 --> 03:50:00.680]  They think disagreeing with them.
[03:50:00.680 --> 03:50:09.680]  They think retweeting them is harassment and the Trust and Safety Council are now going to cater for them as Twitter continues to collapse.
[03:50:09.680 --> 03:50:11.680]  Their stock continues to dive.
[03:50:11.680 --> 03:50:13.680]  They continue to go the way of MySpace.
[03:50:13.680 --> 03:50:16.680]  The verified notifications have broken.
[03:50:16.680 --> 03:50:18.680]  That hasn't been fixed.
[03:50:18.680 --> 03:50:19.680]  Nobody cares.
[03:50:19.680 --> 03:50:20.680]  Twitter's basically dying.
[03:50:20.680 --> 03:50:22.680]  It's going to be gone in a few years.
[03:50:22.680 --> 03:50:26.680]  And if that's their policy, then bon voyage.
[03:50:26.680 --> 03:50:29.680]  Report majority arrested in Portland.
[03:50:29.680 --> 03:50:30.680]  Anti-Trump protests didn't vote.
[03:50:30.680 --> 03:50:31.680]  What a surprise.
[03:50:31.680 --> 03:50:38.680]  More than 50% of the anti-Trump protesters arrested in Portland, Oregon in the days following the election did not bother to vote.
[03:50:38.680 --> 03:50:45.680]  They're all out on the street harassing pregnant women, blocking ambulances, having mass, hissy fits.
[03:50:45.680 --> 03:50:48.680]  Because their candidate didn't win the election.
[03:50:48.680 --> 03:50:55.680]  Turns out more than 50% of them arrested in Portland didn't even bother to get out of their parents' basements to vote in the first place.
[03:50:55.680 --> 03:50:57.680]  We'll be back with the final segment.
[03:50:57.680 --> 03:51:08.680]  We'll see you in the next video.
[03:51:28.680 --> 03:51:32.680]  More doctors are calling to order Extendivite for themselves.
[03:51:32.680 --> 03:51:35.680]  Help Extendivite make your doctor a believer.

[03:53:59.680 --> 03:54:21.680]  Big Berkey water filters are the original and most trusted on the market.
[03:54:21.680 --> 03:54:29.680]  Failing to grasp the very fact why Donald Trump won because he dared to say he wanted to put America first.
[03:54:29.680 --> 03:54:36.680]  And if they continue to not grasp that fact as to why they're continually losing, then all the better for us.
[03:54:36.680 --> 03:54:39.680]  Let's get into a few final news stories here.
[03:54:39.680 --> 03:54:41.680]  Now let's get into this poll that came out.
[03:54:41.680 --> 03:54:44.680]  This isn't the article which is up on info wars.
[03:54:44.680 --> 03:54:48.680]  Desperate establishment media says everything apart from itself is fake.
[03:54:48.680 --> 03:54:53.680]  Of course, this is in relation to Google and Facebook cracking down on fake news,
[03:54:53.680 --> 03:54:58.680]  which if they really cracked down on fake news, the mainstream media wouldn't be on there at all.
[03:54:58.680 --> 03:55:03.680]  Of course, fake news is a problem. It's the problem that I decry on a regular basis.
[03:55:03.680 --> 03:55:06.680]  People just make a complete crap.
[03:55:06.680 --> 03:55:11.680]  And it's obvious to see that it's crap from first glance to make advertising dollars.
[03:55:11.680 --> 03:55:19.680]  But again, what they're doing, they're rolling this all in and saying that bright bar info wars is all part of this fake news output.
[03:55:19.680 --> 03:55:23.680]  When in fact, yes, we publish hundreds of stories a day.
[03:55:23.680 --> 03:55:30.680]  Occasionally we're going to get something wrong, but we don't willingly try to put out fake news, which is what fake news websites do.
[03:55:30.680 --> 03:55:32.680]  They know it's fake news when they publish it.
[03:55:32.680 --> 03:55:37.680]  They publish it for that reason because it's shocking because it's completely made up.
[03:55:37.680 --> 03:55:41.680]  There's a difference between fake news and having a different opinion.
[03:55:41.680 --> 03:55:48.680]  OK, there's a difference between not being CNN, for example, which has interviews with its own cameraman
[03:55:48.680 --> 03:55:53.680]  pretending that they're anti-Trump protesters. OK, that's rigged media.
[03:55:53.680 --> 03:56:00.680]  The rigged media was basically exposed as being fake news in the WikiLeaks revelations.
[03:56:00.680 --> 03:56:11.680]  But this poll is in the article. A new Uyghur poll finds that 7 in 10, 69% of voters do not believe the news media are honest and truthful.
[03:56:11.680 --> 03:56:17.680]  The poll also finds that 8 in 10 of voters believe the corporate news coverage of the presidential campaign was biased
[03:56:17.680 --> 03:56:23.680]  with a nearly three to one majority believing the media were for Clinton versus the ones that were for Trump.
[03:56:23.680 --> 03:56:30.680]  So again, more polls showing that the bias rigged mainstream media is not trusted by the American people.
[03:56:30.680 --> 03:56:34.680]  Surprise, surprise, given that they're coming out of this narrative now,
[03:56:34.680 --> 03:56:42.680]  that it's Trump supporters that are engaging in hateful, violent hate crimes when the reality is the complete opposite.
[03:56:42.680 --> 03:56:46.680]  In fact, I've got a video coming out on YouTube in about 15 minutes from now.
[03:56:46.680 --> 03:56:56.680]  It's called morons react to Trump winning. And it's basically six minutes wall to wall, hateful, violent tweets.
[03:56:56.680 --> 03:57:02.680]  Facebook posts by leftists threatening to kill people who support Trump, threatening to kill Trump himself.
[03:57:02.680 --> 03:57:05.680]  Again, engaging in absolute total idiocy.
[03:57:05.680 --> 03:57:13.680]  Much of it, hateful, much of it could be described as a hate crime if those behaviors, those actions are actually carried out.
[03:57:13.680 --> 03:57:19.680]  So that video is coming out soon on YouTube. It will be up on infowars.com.
[03:57:19.680 --> 03:57:26.680]  Another article up on infowars.com today report Hillary became physically violent after she realized she lost the election.
[03:57:26.680 --> 03:57:32.680]  Now, we knew she was violent. We knew she engaged in rageful temper tantrums for years and years.
[03:57:32.680 --> 03:57:39.680]  Every single Secret Service member who's gone on the record about this says the same thing that people would literally duck into side doors
[03:57:39.680 --> 03:57:46.680]  when she was walking down a corridor because she would just have a massive hissy fit anytime she saw anyone.
[03:57:46.680 --> 03:57:53.680]  Her own campaign last year in October said that she was going to have a meltdown because she was having so many rages.
[03:57:53.680 --> 03:57:58.680]  And again, we're seeing more of these. I like this term Hillary in the bunker stories.
[03:57:58.680 --> 03:58:01.680]  There was one about how she was completely drunk on election night.
[03:58:01.680 --> 03:58:10.680]  Now, this one, according to Todd Kincannon, who spoke to a CNN reporter who told him that Hillary became physically violent towards Robby Mueck and John Podesta.
[03:58:10.680 --> 03:58:14.680]  Her campaign staffers around midnight had to be briefly restrained.
[03:58:14.680 --> 03:58:20.680]  So again, another report about Hillary Clinton having a rage fit that she was drunk on election night.
[03:58:20.680 --> 03:58:25.680]  And of course, that could have been why she didn't appear to give the concession speech that night.
[03:58:25.680 --> 03:58:28.680]  We only saw her the next day.
[03:58:28.680 --> 03:58:33.680]  That's going to wrap it up this edition of the Alex Jones show in Four Wars Nightly News is coming up tonight.
[03:58:33.680 --> 03:58:59.680]  Alex will be back 11 to 2 tomorrow. Breaking news at infowars.com.
