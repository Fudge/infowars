[00:48.400 --> 00:55.400]  behavior interrogation by the TSA after they grope you after they body scan you
[00:55.400 --> 01:00.680]  both then they come over and ask are you angry just a way to harass you and
[01:00.680 --> 01:06.400]  laugh at you and get in your face and interrogation if they don't like the
[01:06.400 --> 01:13.920]  way you don't properly grovel to them they are a Spengali they are a magician

[08:05.280 --> 08:32.080]  because there's a war on for your mind
[08:32.080 --> 08:38.080]  we are back live ladies and gentlemen kick off of another worldwide transmission
[08:38.080 --> 08:47.320]  against tyranny it is the 8th day of September 2011 as we approach the 10
[08:47.320 --> 08:56.040]  year anniversary of 9-11 let me just run through a smattering of some of the
[08:56.040 --> 08:59.320]  news that's coming up and then I'm gonna open the phones up throughout the
[08:59.320 --> 09:04.200]  broadcast well we've got all sorts of news where the sports teams can't even
[09:04.200 --> 09:10.480]  come to the United States now from Mexico to play football games because the
[09:10.480 --> 09:16.080]  Mexican cartels are demanding $30,000 and that can only happen when you have
[09:16.080 --> 09:21.480]  corrupt police that can only happen when the system is so corrupt that the
[09:21.480 --> 09:25.320]  criminals have become untouchables because the government's getting a cut of
[09:25.320 --> 09:33.280]  it and then any time good police try to stand up and speak out they get killed
[09:33.280 --> 09:37.960]  and every day dozens and dozens some some days hundreds of police are killed
[09:37.960 --> 09:44.120]  mayors are killed it is unspeakable and that's one of the stories later in the
[09:44.120 --> 09:48.920]  broadcast I want to spend quite a bit of time on Mexico is an example of where
[09:48.920 --> 09:54.600]  we're headed an absolute criminal state so people respond by not producing
[09:54.600 --> 09:58.120]  people respond by not working hard because somebody's just gonna take it
[09:58.120 --> 10:04.000]  from you and then the society fails and then it collapses like North Korea and
[10:04.000 --> 10:10.640]  the incredibly criminal culture that is taken over Mexico is now taking over the
[10:10.640 --> 10:16.240]  United States and it's emerging quite nicely with the criminal Wall Street
[10:16.240 --> 10:21.240]  culture but here's a headline here out of the Austin American statesman we're
[10:21.240 --> 10:24.920]  gonna get this up at info wars.com the next few minutes I'll give it to Kurt
[10:24.920 --> 10:28.440]  Nemo in fact we'll give this to Kurt and have him posted a link to it so people
[10:28.440 --> 10:35.040]  can find it easy Mexican football team backs out of stony point game that's
[10:35.040 --> 10:40.920]  right and more and more this was going on decades ago if you tried to go down
[10:40.920 --> 10:44.880]  into the border areas of Mexico as a college student or whatever they would
[10:44.880 --> 10:49.800]  just arrest you for no reason run your credit and then call your family and say
[10:49.800 --> 10:52.680]  depending on how much money your family have we want ten thousand we want a
[10:52.680 --> 10:56.640]  hundred thousand dollars and if you paid the money they would start
[10:56.640 --> 11:01.320]  torturing you generally if your family ignored you you'd sit there for a month
[11:01.320 --> 11:05.040]  in the dirt floor jail where nobody really feeds you families have to bring
[11:05.040 --> 11:09.240]  their family food and then about a month later they would just let you go but if
[11:09.240 --> 11:13.040]  you started paying the government would then hold you and then what they do is
[11:13.040 --> 11:18.960]  they take a sprite and they put you upside down and they dump Tabasco sauce
[11:18.960 --> 11:25.040]  a red pepper sauce habanero up your nose and then they pop the sprite or I
[11:25.040 --> 11:29.280]  should be a top of Chico and shoot fizzy water up your nose one of the worst
[11:29.280 --> 11:33.600]  forms of torture known but doesn't show any marks and this can go on for a while
[11:33.600 --> 11:38.840]  and the money is extracted now if you criticize it you're politically
[11:38.840 --> 11:43.280]  incorrect and hateful because everybody knows Mexico is a pantheon of happiness
[11:43.280 --> 11:48.520]  grace and love and the stupid gringos no matter what color you are dumb
[11:48.520 --> 11:53.120]  Americans as we're called go down to Mexico to control zones like Mexico
[11:53.120 --> 11:57.640]  City and places like that controlled by the mobster government where they try
[11:57.640 --> 12:01.320]  to keep crime at a minimum and you sit there in a delusional fashion thinking
[12:01.320 --> 12:05.120]  how beautiful the beaches are while there's children running around who
[12:05.120 --> 12:08.480]  haven't eaten in days just a few miles away with sewers running right down the
[12:08.480 --> 12:12.960]  middle of the street so I'm already starting to get into this here today
[12:12.960 --> 12:17.320]  but but this is already happening now in the US where people are being told
[12:17.320 --> 12:22.360]  don't have this event or we're going to kill you and the police are more and
[12:22.360 --> 12:26.520]  more becoming corrupt and we're taking the payoffs and then once they start
[12:26.520 --> 12:29.280]  taking the payoffs they're told to go along with more and more corruption and
[12:29.280 --> 12:34.160]  if they say no they just get killed the board of patrols running drugs the DEA
[12:34.160 --> 12:40.720]  is running drugs the ATF is now moving in big time and you've got a lot of ATF
[12:40.720 --> 12:44.880]  officers living in two million dollar homes don't nobody bats an eye you're
[12:44.880 --> 12:48.600]  making 50 60 grand a year 100 grand a year and you're living in a two three
[12:48.600 --> 12:51.880]  million dollar house and driving brand-new Corvettes and it's just a
[12:51.880 --> 12:56.720]  great mafia system and so they love it a 500 billion a year because they keep
[12:56.720 --> 13:01.160]  drugs illegal and now the criminal gangs are branching out into kidnapping and
[13:01.160 --> 13:05.680]  extortion kidnapping is that more than 20 fold the last decade in Phoenix
[13:05.680 --> 13:10.680]  Arizona alone it's up more than 10 fold in San Antonio and so we're gonna live
[13:10.680 --> 13:17.720]  just like they do in Guatemala El Salvador Nicaragua Venezuela and the
[13:17.720 --> 13:22.020]  whole culture is collapsing and it's gonna collapse into a hell pit and the
[13:22.020 --> 13:26.520]  bankers will sit offshore in Switzerland and other armored redoubts you know
[13:26.520 --> 13:30.440]  enjoying themselves in free societies little pockets they keep for themselves
[13:30.440 --> 13:36.040]  they fly above us be a helicopter into armored compounds in New York Los Angeles
[13:36.040 --> 13:41.520]  Austin Texas and just laugh at everyone at the system of corruption that they've
[13:41.520 --> 13:46.960]  created so there it is Mexican football team backs out of stony point game it
[13:46.960 --> 13:52.440]  goes on with a week to go before a showdown of state-ranked to Soto stony
[13:52.440 --> 13:57.920]  point has received some unexpected free time round rock ISD athletic director
[13:57.920 --> 14:06.120]  Jim Lorwald confirmed yesterday afternoon that Monterey Tech has backed out
[14:06.120 --> 14:09.880]  of a game which was scheduled to be played on Thursday against stony point
[14:09.880 --> 14:18.400]  according to the coach or athletic director Monterey Tech a football team
[14:18.400 --> 14:21.960]  from Mexico that played games at the Woodlands and Highland Park over the
[14:21.960 --> 14:27.400]  past two weeks claimed that a cartel was demanding $30,000 in order to let
[14:27.400 --> 14:32.320]  Monterey Tech cross and come back across the border and by the way when we
[14:32.320 --> 14:36.720]  told you a decade ago the Mexican troops in uniform in Mexican armored vehicles
[14:36.720 --> 14:41.480]  bring the drugs up and send the carriers across I've interviewed sheriff's
[14:41.480 --> 14:45.640]  repeatedly in Texas what just four years ago and again three years ago it was in
[14:45.640 --> 14:50.800]  the local news that they'll catch a 18-wheeler a dump truck you name it
[14:50.800 --> 14:56.200]  cocaine heroin marijuana and they'll be two three four five six miles across in
[14:56.200 --> 15:00.840]  some incidents and here come armored vehicles Humvees they pull up Mexican
[15:00.840 --> 15:05.000]  troops set up on highways board patrol stands down they say get out of the car
[15:05.000 --> 15:09.560]  in English with a bullhorn they say give us our vehicle or I'm gonna kill you
[15:09.560 --> 15:13.200]  right now they take it right back across and Americans you literally begin
[15:13.200 --> 15:17.960]  urinating on themselves this is what America is TSA wants to go in the pants
[15:17.960 --> 15:22.680]  boom it happens Mexican troops want to come rob police it happens these are the
[15:22.680 --> 15:28.000]  cops that actually you're trying to seize the drugs you can't have a lemonade
[15:28.000 --> 15:32.280]  stand you're going to jail local firefighters can't fight the fires
[15:32.280 --> 15:35.600]  famous the boss you know they want to come to New Orleans take your guns they
[15:35.600 --> 15:41.400]  do it it's just a bunch of stinking dirty criminal mobsters breaking our will
[15:41.400 --> 15:45.960]  training us to accept hell on earth feds are now announcing the rural council
[15:45.960 --> 15:50.280]  animal ID premises ID we're coming on your property all these regulations on
[15:50.280 --> 15:54.480]  small farms and ranches that big agris exempt from they're now listing hay and
[15:54.480 --> 16:00.000]  coming on feedlots as a pollutant saying that you if there's any small pieces of
[16:00.000 --> 16:04.640]  hay they can find you because it's a pollutant I mean you can't make this up
[16:04.640 --> 16:11.160]  I covered that yesterday and it is just so wild people say well they're so
[16:11.160 --> 16:14.480]  criminal if they're so mafia why haven't they put you in jail why but they
[16:14.480 --> 16:17.080]  killed you well they've threatened me and they've done dirty tricks and they've
[16:17.080 --> 16:21.480]  tried to assassinate my character and they've run co-intel pro posing as
[16:21.480 --> 16:26.640]  patriots and the but I it's people praying for me it's the grace of God but
[16:26.640 --> 16:31.480]  it's also the fact that they don't want to validate everything I've said and
[16:31.480 --> 16:37.440]  done by making me a martyr and in another level they like it they don't
[16:37.440 --> 16:41.440]  care criminals like to hear about what they're doing a lot of times they like
[16:41.440 --> 16:46.800]  to write letters into the cops and I'm telling you it's time to try to turn the
[16:46.800 --> 16:51.120]  corner on this but you've got to recognize just how corrupt our country
[16:51.120 --> 16:56.880]  is Monterey Tech cancellation as well as rumors that were previously
[16:56.880 --> 17:01.280]  circulated about the age of players in the University of Nuevo León team
[17:01.280 --> 17:05.680]  stony point beat two weeks ago will probably impact future scheduling
[17:05.680 --> 17:11.040]  decisions by round rock ISD both of Mexican teams played stony point during
[17:11.040 --> 17:16.080]  09010 seasons because the Tigers troubles with filling out a schedule so I
[17:16.080 --> 17:22.000]  guess now high school teams play Mexican high school teams talk about total
[17:22.000 --> 17:27.040]  merger of the countries I don't think that will be a priority the athletic
[17:27.040 --> 17:30.680]  director said the only reason we got locked in this deal is because nobody
[17:30.680 --> 17:37.840]  wanted to play stony point so there you go just a little snapshot of how Mexico
[17:37.840 --> 17:46.440]  works small snapshot cartels come in you try to start a little taco shop and they
[17:46.440 --> 17:49.760]  come in they say you got to pay me you pay them and other cartel comes and you
[17:49.760 --> 17:52.800]  got to pay me and you're like but we're not gonna make any money they're like
[17:52.800 --> 17:58.480]  okay you just talk back to me boom or right in front of the family they'll
[17:58.480 --> 18:01.920]  chop the daddy's head off but now that's not enough they always kind of had
[18:01.920 --> 18:06.560]  this rule not to kill kids now they behead children they behead women and
[18:06.560 --> 18:10.880]  and then when the when the governor of Arizona says there's beheadings going on
[18:10.880 --> 18:14.000]  our media comes out and says there aren't even though there were you can go
[18:14.000 --> 18:20.600]  look it up in Arizona beheadings very bizarre and and Mexican troops come
[18:20.600 --> 18:25.560]  across and shoot the guy on his jet ski on a Texas Mexico border leg and turns
[18:25.560 --> 18:29.560]  out witnesses later saw it and they said the woman's lying on the news not true
[18:29.560 --> 18:36.800]  there's no violence see because because this is this is where we're going we let
[18:36.800 --> 18:43.760]  the big banks 70 80 years ago criminalized cocaine and heroin that the
[18:43.760 --> 18:48.480]  big mega banks were already the sole importers of but they were losing their
[18:48.480 --> 18:52.560]  monopoly so they just made it illegal you could go to any five and dime and
[18:52.560 --> 18:56.200]  walk in about pure heroin pure cocaine and if you were dumb enough to go home
[18:56.200 --> 19:02.520]  and take it and die that was your issue drug use was much lower statistically it
[19:02.520 --> 19:07.080]  wasn't till the mid 30s they took cocaine out of Coca-Cola Coca-Cola flavoring is
[19:07.080 --> 19:14.480]  decokinated cocaine it is a cocaine molecule so it's called coke and people
[19:14.480 --> 19:17.280]  don't believe that it's it's admitted it's hidden in plain view it's called
[19:17.280 --> 19:21.880]  coke I'll assure you it's cocaine flavor that's what a Coca-Cola is that's what
[19:21.880 --> 19:26.400]  Pepsi is that's what that's what RC Cola is it's a it's a D and that's the
[19:26.400 --> 19:31.320]  secret ingredient it's a it's a decokinated cocaine so we let the big
[19:31.320 --> 19:36.920]  mega banks make their product illegal so they could corrupt police make giant
[19:36.920 --> 19:44.320]  profits and now they're taking over every other industry and they openly again
[19:44.320 --> 19:48.400]  own most the big mega prisons that are private so they make money on that end
[19:48.400 --> 19:52.680]  too taxpayer money and the slave wages they pay the people to build widgets to
[19:52.680 --> 19:57.280]  then take your job and now they're moving into everything's gonna be illegal

[26:40.160 --> 26:48.000]  environmental cult while they ignore all the serious environmental issues also
[26:48.000 --> 26:54.600]  continuing with the news we're gonna get into Ron Paul and the debate last night
[26:54.600 --> 27:07.600]  and then the fact that he won the MSNBC poll by more than 20 points ahead of his opponent
[27:07.600 --> 27:12.120]  and so on the graph he should have been way ahead of everybody but they said he
[27:12.120 --> 27:16.520]  narrowly won the poll and then they shrunk the graph down where he's just
[27:16.520 --> 27:20.160]  barely past Mitt Romney even though he's got a lot more points than Mitt Romney
[27:20.160 --> 27:25.080]  we'll show you the graph later if you're watching on prisonplanet.tv and and go
[27:25.080 --> 27:31.280]  over it here but they always try little tricks it's like wow he he he almost got
[27:31.280 --> 27:36.200]  actually look at the graph it's almost double what they got and where is that
[27:36.200 --> 27:42.120]  my stack I start going from from memory and I don't want to I don't want to get
[27:42.120 --> 27:48.040]  that wrong here it is Ron Paul border fence could be used to keep us in I got a
[27:48.040 --> 27:52.560]  bunch of other Ron Paul articles here in my stack that when I get to it I'm gonna
[27:52.560 --> 28:00.000]  I'm gonna go over it and here it is in fact guys
[28:01.960 --> 28:08.760]  why don't you yeah there's the graph oh they've now adjusted it since they got
[28:08.760 --> 28:14.720]  caught where he's winning by an even bigger margin but as of last night
[28:14.720 --> 28:22.120]  screenshot they had the green graph where even though he has 51% and the
[28:22.120 --> 28:28.360]  next guy Mitt Romney has 18 so more than double they just had Paul barely passed
[28:28.360 --> 28:33.360]  it in fact even in the screenshot from my article from this morning they do
[28:33.360 --> 28:36.760]  they'd let it grown a little bit more but last night he was just that he was
[28:36.760 --> 28:42.880]  just a hair ahead of it in fact there's an article that Mike Adams did MSNBC
[28:42.880 --> 28:49.960]  distorts post-debate poll results to falsify and to pick Ron Paul as just
[28:49.960 --> 28:55.760]  barely winning again MSNBC distorts post-debate poll results to falsely
[28:55.760 --> 28:59.960]  depict Ron Paul as just barely winning and if you go to that article you can
[28:59.960 --> 29:05.240]  see the screenshot link from last night where in fact here it is if you guys
[29:05.240 --> 29:08.500]  give me a document cam shot I can just I can just show people watching on
[29:08.500 --> 29:12.040]  prisonplanet.tv this right now and then folks can go to info wars and read the
[29:12.040 --> 29:20.440]  article but here's a screenshot last night where he was 40 43.5 percent
[29:20.440 --> 29:25.880]  Mitt Romney at 21.5 and look he's only a little bit ahead now since this got
[29:25.880 --> 29:30.640]  pointed out that MSNBC was showing this on TV and doing this this morning they
[29:30.640 --> 29:36.040]  switched it to this when he had 48% and showed Paul someone ahead now the graph
[29:36.040 --> 29:41.680]  is accurate this morning showing Paul's Paul's graph more than double ahead of
[29:41.680 --> 29:46.360]  everybody else so see we're catching them we're catching in their tricks and
[29:46.360 --> 29:51.160]  it's not working so it's backfiring and they're adjusting we're on the march the

[35:02.360 --> 35:05.200]  the people there is liberty when the people fear the government there is
[35:05.200 --> 35:13.280]  tyranny it is an elementary equation my dear Watson I'm not that smart folks
[35:13.280 --> 35:19.280]  this the Bible verse comes to mind out of the mouths of babes I'm somebody that
[35:19.280 --> 35:24.320]  grew up in Dallas and watch the police deal the drugs and then watch them
[35:24.320 --> 35:29.600]  grandstand and talk about fighting drugs that's what woke Alex Jones up and I
[35:29.600 --> 35:35.280]  started to say what I see on TV or what I hear the principal say in a speech that
[35:35.280 --> 35:39.760]  isn't what's really going on and these crooks have learned to wear uniforms to
[35:39.760 --> 35:45.520]  wear a corporate uniform of a suit to talk real calm and confident they're
[35:45.520 --> 35:51.920]  con men and women they operate in packs and gangs there are still some good
[35:51.920 --> 35:57.400]  people left mainly who were naive in government the public's naivete is
[35:57.400 --> 36:03.320]  conjuring hell on earth only breaking the trance and waking up can reverse
[36:03.320 --> 36:07.440]  what's happening in our society now listen it's a total overload of
[36:07.440 --> 36:12.120]  information but first I'm going to take your calls before I get into any of this
[36:12.120 --> 36:30.480]  800 259 9231 800 259 9231 now I had the lady on yesterday the blogger what Amy
[36:30.480 --> 36:39.000]  Alcon who reportedly had the TSA go into her vaginal area and they confirm they
[36:39.000 --> 36:43.720]  do this they they will either go in the pants or outside and check to see with
[36:43.720 --> 36:46.720]  men they squeeze your genitals to make sure they're real I'm sorry I have to
[36:46.720 --> 36:50.760]  talk about this but this is what goes on in America and they grab and squeeze
[36:50.760 --> 36:55.760]  it's it's many congressmen we've had on have described it as painful on this
[36:55.760 --> 37:01.040]  show Ventura has described to me privately as painful because he has to
[37:01.040 --> 37:04.040]  always go through as his hip goes off and they they go let's see what those
[37:04.040 --> 37:08.120]  are and they squeeze and if you're not a man you don't know but that that's
[37:08.120 --> 37:13.200]  extremely painful it's you God designed us so those things get kept intact and
[37:13.200 --> 37:18.120]  don't get hurt so you can pass on the genetics to the next generation I don't
[37:18.120 --> 37:21.280]  want to get into any detail but somebody can thump you and it can cause
[37:21.280 --> 37:24.960]  excruciating pain well they they they grab and they lift you up and they may
[37:24.960 --> 37:28.400]  and they do it to women and pilots on record we've interviewed some of them
[37:28.400 --> 37:33.880]  senior pilots military veterans will go and some of them vomit some of them
[37:33.880 --> 37:38.960]  have have gone and vomited on the scene because you got to sit there and take
[37:38.960 --> 37:43.360]  somebody and sometimes they do it for a long time and a lot of perverts and get
[37:43.360 --> 37:46.920]  off on it and they sit there and rub on you and they and the men really
[37:46.920 --> 37:49.880]  reportedly get upset when they go in between the butt cheeks and that's
[37:49.880 --> 37:55.080]  inventor is a lawsuit that they I might even say on air they they they they go
[37:55.080 --> 38:01.040]  up in try to make sure nothing's in there and I mean you know I mean if my
[38:01.040 --> 38:05.600]  wife was doing that it freaked me out I mean that that's that's that's that's
[38:05.600 --> 38:11.800]  that's not for that you imagine a man or a woman doing this I mean I don't think
[38:11.800 --> 38:16.960]  I'd well I actually know what I do in this situation and I haven't gotten into a
[38:16.960 --> 38:21.600]  lot on air but I did go on one trip they did start to grab on my six-year-old
[38:21.600 --> 38:27.400]  daughter at the time and I did get very angry and I'm just I'm just glad we
[38:27.400 --> 38:32.640]  ended up getting out of it at the end of the day because it was I I cannot
[38:32.640 --> 38:37.080]  travel with my children okay I just cannot let perverts grab on them and and
[38:37.080 --> 38:42.040]  I can't handle it and it is coming to that point with tyranny I don't want
[38:42.040 --> 38:45.600]  trouble I'm not looking for it but everybody knows where this country's
[38:45.600 --> 38:49.320]  going and the system knows they're pushing is pushing is pushing is they
[38:49.320 --> 38:56.640]  want people to go off and at a certain point I think we need to just take all
[38:56.640 --> 39:01.200]  this abuse for now and just like Gandhi would do they he'd let him beat him in
[39:01.200 --> 39:04.120]  the head with sticks right in front everybody because he knew everybody was
[39:04.120 --> 39:08.960]  watching and and and they were wanting violence they could really pull out the
[39:08.960 --> 39:12.960]  big guns so we've got a no one to hold them no one to fold them no one to walk
[39:12.960 --> 39:17.280]  away no one to run to quote Kenny Rogers now that we're on a country music kick
[39:17.280 --> 39:20.800]  here and I'm about to go to this this caller this mini guest who couldn't get
[39:20.800 --> 39:25.440]  on air yesterday so we're going to her today to tell the TSA story but when you
[39:25.440 --> 39:29.920]  look at what's happening and you realize this is scientific humiliation on
[39:29.920 --> 39:36.320]  purpose and literal submission training and you see Miss USA crying they went in
[39:36.320 --> 39:46.720]  her pants and into her body can you imagine the magnitude of that and again
[39:46.720 --> 39:53.960]  the pilots said are you crazy we're flying a giant 20 million dollar plane
[39:53.960 --> 39:58.760]  that weighs tens of tons you're gonna trust us to fly it you're gonna have
[39:58.760 --> 40:03.640]  some goon do this no we're boycotting and they said we're not gonna fly we're
[40:03.640 --> 40:07.120]  gonna have a pilot strike and they said oh that's fine we'll make a new line for
[40:07.120 --> 40:12.080]  you we're not gonna touch anymore grown men would have to not fly that get so
[40:12.080 --> 40:15.720]  upset because you don't your pilot upset they would go throw up or some would
[40:15.720 --> 40:19.720]  get angry and then get arrested you saw that hey man stop grab what are you
[40:19.720 --> 40:24.280]  doing hey get your hands off me oh get the cops over this guy doesn't like us
[40:24.280 --> 40:33.360]  grabbing as you know what I can't handle it anymore but again the psychological
[40:33.360 --> 40:40.480]  warfare chiefs know what they're doing now remember it's the the TSA people are
[40:40.480 --> 40:46.040]  baking with the regular x-ray scanners that are super high powered with no real
[40:46.040 --> 40:50.480]  shielding on them with open ends it's going through a scanner with an open end
[40:50.480 --> 40:54.720]  they're not behind lead walls you're being hit by an x-ray machine the
[40:54.720 --> 40:58.840]  globalists love this now they've got the other scanners they've got their own
[40:58.840 --> 41:03.600]  internal reports they suppressed eight-fold increase in cancer in the airports
[41:03.600 --> 41:07.320]  the five airports they've been testing them now for almost almost eight years
[41:07.320 --> 41:14.120]  an eight-fold increase you pull this up these people are the walking dead they
[41:14.120 --> 41:19.080]  live in an x-ray machine again the globalists are about testing to see what
[41:19.080 --> 41:23.120]  they can do it's like the Nazis can we get people you know that they'd have
[41:23.120 --> 41:26.960]  women lined up naked and then lines of men lined up naked with babies in their
[41:26.960 --> 41:31.040]  arms is a famous Nazi footage all you folks who say the Nazis weren't brutal
[41:31.040 --> 41:34.680]  they're an evil with the footage is on record and they would and they'd have
[41:34.680 --> 41:38.560]  the people run in and watch the one group get shot and then they would politely
[41:38.560 --> 41:42.680]  bow to the Nazis because you know they wanted to be proper they'd run down in
[41:42.680 --> 41:46.600]  the pit and they shoot the next group in the head and stand over and shoot the
[41:46.600 --> 41:51.280]  babies and then and then the men would strip down and yes sir and I mean I'm
[41:51.280 --> 41:56.600]  an extremist because I would have been killing people long before I ever got to
[41:56.600 --> 42:03.680]  that ditch you understand that and that's not an extreme statement I'm not
[42:03.680 --> 42:10.360]  going to go in your ditch and you're like whoa that's extreme I guess I am I
[42:10.360 --> 42:16.520]  guess in the land of insane people the same man is insane I mean just classic
[42:16.520 --> 42:20.720]  Karen he coming down on us like a ton of bricks and I'm supposed to sit here and
[42:20.720 --> 42:24.680]  love it now now I'm gonna shut up and go to this caller cuz cat at the end of
[42:24.680 --> 42:28.940]  the show got cut off yesterday I went into five minutes of overdrive as he
[42:28.940 --> 42:32.280]  still got cut off cuz I had to end the show we got in full Wars nightly news
[42:32.280 --> 42:35.600]  now and I've got to get ready for it a ton of work is going into this folks if
[42:35.600 --> 42:40.640]  you're not a member become a member download the archive capture the
[42:40.640 --> 42:44.400]  stream share your passcode with your friends and family get this out to
[42:44.400 --> 42:50.080]  everybody prisonplanet.tv but she told the story and and then and this is how
[42:50.080 --> 42:55.560]  they describe it they've they've basically mutated the Israeli system where
[42:55.560 --> 42:58.640]  they question you at three different checkpoints and ask where you're going
[42:58.640 --> 43:02.200]  what you're doing and then the Israelis are actually I'm not saying their
[43:02.200 --> 43:05.160]  system's good but it's been a hundred percent effective I'm not saying it's
[43:05.160 --> 43:08.320]  good for for America but it's been a hundred percent effective stopping all
[43:08.320 --> 43:16.280]  terrorism they profile they talk to people they've got databases but see the
[43:16.280 --> 43:19.840]  globalist love saying we're not going to profile here it's all based on a hoax
[43:19.840 --> 43:25.120]  to begin with because everybody loses their rights so now I've actually been
[43:25.120 --> 43:29.280]  in airports and seen even a year ago the TSA at the counter you know we're
[43:29.280 --> 43:32.880]  getting something to eat reading a book about you know behavioral detection so
[43:32.880 --> 43:36.760]  they read a few books they go to a few classes I think it's like 10 hours total
[43:36.760 --> 43:41.320]  and then now they call you a side and say where are you going what are you
[43:41.320 --> 43:45.560]  doing are you angry today do you not like being questioned and then if they
[43:45.560 --> 43:51.280]  don't like the way you talk you go in a database and can't travel anymore and
[43:51.280 --> 43:56.960]  and are kicked out so it's God it's God and you've got this glow-in-the-dark
[43:56.960 --> 44:02.360]  radiation victim moron who's so stupid that they work in a radiation
[44:02.360 --> 44:07.960]  environment with no controls violating federal law with cancer exploding but
[44:07.960 --> 44:11.880]  they love the power so much and that's who they're picking out a lot of these
[44:11.880 --> 44:15.520]  TSA just want the job I've talked to them I go through and they say we're
[44:15.520 --> 44:18.640]  awake we know it's wrong thank you can I have your autograph I'm like but your
[44:18.640 --> 44:22.400]  supervisor oh he's a fan too I mean all over the country so I don't want to just
[44:22.400 --> 44:26.640]  say they're all demons it's all and I've talked to him on and off air it's the
[44:26.640 --> 44:30.800]  supervisors are always the control freak it's like when you opt out they go opt
[44:30.800 --> 44:34.960]  out and then the thug comes over the person that enjoys it and the other
[44:34.960 --> 44:39.200]  ones are like you know of course the thug kind of hides out in the back away
[44:39.200 --> 44:42.520]  from the radiation they just come into the radiation bath you know to have a
[44:42.520 --> 44:46.760]  little like a power trip fun and then they kind of swoop in to have a little
[44:46.760 --> 44:53.560]  psychic vampire feeding and now they they come over and say did that make you
[44:53.560 --> 44:59.200]  angry you didn't like he's making you angry I'm grabbing your genitals yeah
[44:59.200 --> 45:04.760]  it's making me angry oh that's a terror son get your stuff and get out of here

[45:11.720 --> 45:15.400]  17 years old she's in Pennsylvania but she was flying out of another airport
[45:15.400 --> 45:19.720]  when this happened to take her time till the whole story of what happened and how
[45:19.720 --> 45:23.480]  it ended with the behavioral modification you said he had his arms
[45:23.480 --> 45:29.960]  behind his back walking around like a third-world dictator chin up just enjoying
[45:29.960 --> 45:36.280]  himself so so so describe it the the scanning the groping and the interrogating
[45:36.280 --> 45:44.320]  tell us all about it hi okay well um I was in Denver Colorado and so like I
[45:44.320 --> 45:48.880]  said they were pushing everyone in the line for the TSA full body scanner you
[45:48.880 --> 45:52.760]  really had the regular ones right next to it and I was up next and she said
[45:52.760 --> 45:57.440]  please you know go step up to the yellow tape and I said well I'm under age you
[45:57.440 --> 46:02.880]  know I'm only 17 I feel I don't feel like I should go through that and I asked
[46:02.880 --> 46:08.120]  there was another like method that I could do and she said well we have five
[46:08.120 --> 46:12.120]  year olds that go through there so you just go and she would choose a lot
[46:12.120 --> 46:16.880]  louder and a lot more forceful we have five year olds go through there get in
[46:16.880 --> 46:22.120]  their tuts so what happened next she had her hands on my back she wasn't too
[46:22.120 --> 46:26.240]  forceful but she still was touching me and so I just went forward you know I
[46:26.240 --> 46:29.760]  was and again you're supposed to be able to quote opt out but they even admit
[46:29.760 --> 46:33.680]  all over they force people through these so it's all unlawful garbage
[46:33.680 --> 46:39.360]  intimidation please continue right so um I step into the big machine and they
[46:39.360 --> 46:43.000]  uh they make me stand you know with everything spread out and I really
[46:43.000 --> 46:47.680]  didn't like that and I mean it's a perpetrator position it's training you
[46:47.680 --> 46:51.560]  that your criminal hands up get ready for the scan you see the images of the
[46:51.560 --> 46:54.920]  scans you can see the bones in the fingers you're being high-powered x-rayed
[46:54.920 --> 47:00.800]  please continue yeah exactly I felt terrible and not only did I have to do
[47:00.800 --> 47:05.240]  it one time they messed up and they had to do it another time and something was
[47:05.240 --> 47:08.000]  wrong again and they said please step out we're gonna have to give you a pat
[47:08.000 --> 47:14.040]  down and I was like wait no no I refuse the pat down and as she started to go
[47:14.040 --> 47:17.720]  from my shoulders down she was like oh I guess it's fine it's probably just your
[47:17.720 --> 47:21.560]  zipper please move along and you know the line kept going my family went
[47:21.560 --> 47:25.760]  through and then uh we were in the back putting on our shoes and we were
[47:25.760 --> 47:30.320]  talking about it we were obviously said about it you were talking about it oh
[47:30.320 --> 47:35.440]  you don't do that in America what else happened um so anyway we're you know my
[47:35.440 --> 47:39.200]  brother and I were complaining about it and this guy he must have been all of
[47:39.200 --> 47:44.520]  23 or something he came over and he said are you guys angry today you seem
[47:44.520 --> 47:50.640]  angry are you right where you going that kind of stuff and uh my mom was

[48:01.520 --> 48:05.120]  training ground they're now going on the streets of America and even high school
[48:05.120 --> 48:10.880]  proms this is how America falls with a bunch of weird quasi minimum wage
[48:10.880 --> 48:16.240]  power trip people the 10 hour psychology course bossing everybody around so he's

[48:52.560 --> 48:56.040]  already picking out my brother because he's got a beard you know he looks
[48:56.040 --> 49:01.320]  different and um so he just goes he puts his hands behind his back and leaves
[49:01.320 --> 49:07.320]  for it and he goes perception and he strolled along and starts talking to
[49:07.320 --> 49:10.760]  other people and my mom was like let's get the hell out of here you know you

[49:47.120 --> 49:51.320]  future to be where my brother go he's going for further assessment is part of
[49:51.320 --> 49:54.720]  the homeland system

[50:12.640 --> 50:16.080]  radiation bath here you're always adding more and more more this is a

[54:42.080 --> 54:46.480]  that aren't free market just come in and lobby government buy-off government to
[54:46.480 --> 54:51.320]  do whatever they want and there's just every form of corruption stacked on
[54:51.320 --> 54:56.640]  every form of corruption and the system just exercises power we're gonna falsely
[54:56.640 --> 55:01.520]  order everybody to take a shot that we know has been killing people in the
[55:01.520 --> 55:06.160]  trials and then Rick Perry kept saying last night when he was being put on the
[55:06.160 --> 55:09.520]  hot seat in the debate about it hey you tried to force girls take a shot and he
[55:09.520 --> 55:16.680]  went I added and I allowed a opt out there is no opt out and he went it was
[55:16.680 --> 55:20.960]  not a law it was an executive order he went on air and lied and said it's an
[55:20.960 --> 55:25.120]  executive order it's now law you must take it and people lined up it was like
[55:25.120 --> 55:28.280]  wow the governor says I've got to take it and I'm like on air going here's the
[55:28.280 --> 55:33.160]  US and state code it's not true he put on the list of recommended shots to the
[55:33.160 --> 55:36.880]  state health department they then recommend it to the schools you don't
[55:36.880 --> 55:41.120]  to take any of them there's not even a waiver there's no law they ask you to
[55:41.120 --> 55:45.000]  sign a waiver that's a contract that then puts you on a list at the health
[55:45.000 --> 55:52.200]  department as if you're a bad parent it's all a fraud and those politicians
[55:52.200 --> 55:55.200]  just sit up there knowing all these games knowing all these points
[55:55.200 --> 56:01.440]  manipulating people we're gonna start the second hour and go to Luke
[56:01.440 --> 56:09.440]  refracide Sean Donna Judy and others we'll just take a bunch of calls and
[56:09.440 --> 56:15.000]  then for five minutes he's popping in the artist Alec Schaefer I told you he'd
[56:15.000 --> 56:19.080]  get tens of thousands of dollars once he was on the show particularly it was
[56:19.080 --> 56:22.040]  going for like a thousand bucks to leave on the show then it was ten thousand and
[56:22.040 --> 56:25.720]  it went for twenty five thousand dollars on eBay the painting of Bank of
[56:25.720 --> 56:31.840]  America not Bank of America same thing same difference chase burning and so
[56:31.840 --> 56:35.440]  he'll be popping in to talk about it closing last night at twenty five
[56:35.440 --> 56:40.160]  thousand a lot of people pointed out I've gotten countless emails well hey the
[56:40.160 --> 56:45.200]  Denver Airport's got weird Nazis machine-gunning kids burning buildings
[56:45.200 --> 56:50.920]  burning cities coffins everywhere are the police gonna come question or arrest
[56:50.920 --> 56:54.880]  whoever painted the Denver Airport by the way Denver Airport never explains
[56:54.880 --> 56:59.720]  what in Hades it means you go to the Denver Airport you're like what is this
[56:59.720 --> 57:06.240]  giant murals everywhere of people being killed and they just go move along but
[57:06.240 --> 57:13.440]  yeah little dead girls and coffins and flowers I mean you talk about weird and
[57:13.440 --> 57:18.440]  macabre try to find the photos the big Nazis and mowing down kids because I'm
[57:18.440 --> 57:22.520]  gonna ask him that question but the rest of the show it's gonna be phone calls
[57:22.520 --> 57:27.960]  and news I've got Libyan news I will cover it I've got a bunch of clips from
[57:27.960 --> 57:38.760]  the debate last night we're going to be going over all of it a weird paintings
[57:38.760 --> 57:43.200]  of the grim reaper and spirits taking children to hell with guys with big
[57:43.200 --> 57:49.080]  swords and Nazi uniforms chopping chopping down the dove of peace and I
[57:49.080 --> 57:55.560]  actually get the art it looks like anti-war that looks like Spanish Civil
[57:55.560 --> 58:00.560]  War or something but but but still are you gonna send the police to question
[58:00.560 --> 58:10.280]  them I think the big news here is that Ron Paul in the after poll won by more
[58:10.280 --> 58:15.280]  than double it more than double it 50 something now when it closed and and
[58:15.280 --> 58:20.000]  Romney at 18 and so they basically you know look at the graphs they just had
[58:20.000 --> 58:23.640]  Paul barely beating him even though if the graph was accurate it'd be more than
[58:23.640 --> 58:27.480]  double all the other graphs were accurate and then and I guess to Paul oh
[58:27.480 --> 58:35.160]  he barely won they said yeah just by more than double we'll be right back
[58:35.160 --> 58:39.720]  stay with us ladies and gentlemen hour number two straight ahead
[58:42.360 --> 58:52.160]  this is GCN the Genesis Communications Radio Network a very wealthy US citizen

[58:56.440 --> 59:00.800]  America in more than 50 years he says it will change everything about our lives

[59:08.080 --> 59:12.560]  predictions over the years the crazy part is he's usually right you see he
[59:12.560 --> 59:16.240]  predicted the collapse of GM Panny May Friday Mack and America's biggest
[59:16.240 --> 59:20.720]  small-owner general growth properties in fact Barron's called his work a dire
[59:20.720 --> 59:24.520]  prophecy recently he created a video which you can watch online for free
[59:24.520 --> 59:27.960]  detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet and it's a real

[1:00:04.520 --> 1:00:12.240]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[1:00:12.240 --> 1:00:19.800]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin, Texas
[1:00:19.800 --> 1:00:23.400]  Alex Jones
[1:00:26.200 --> 1:00:31.080]  we're in our number two I'm gonna take a bunch of your calls right now and then
[1:00:31.080 --> 1:00:35.040]  I'm gonna get into this latest article I'm asking Curtin Emma right now to do a
[1:00:35.040 --> 1:00:44.760]  story on this the big nightly news NBC report does not even mention Ron Paul
[1:00:44.760 --> 1:00:48.240]  the winner of their poll in this article they mentioned all the other
[1:00:48.240 --> 1:00:51.920]  candidates that were there but did not mention Ron Paul they also got caught
[1:00:51.920 --> 1:00:58.640]  manipulating the poll numbers and we have a article on that this morning written
[1:00:58.640 --> 1:01:04.360]  by Mike Adams of natural news up on info wars.com so that is going to be
[1:01:04.360 --> 1:01:09.720]  coming up just an illustration of media manipulation also a new expanded NAFTA
[1:01:09.720 --> 1:01:14.120]  system just a bunch of other key news we got a bunch of clips from the debate
[1:01:14.120 --> 1:01:18.360]  I'm going to get to also the probably the biggest news of the day big sis set
[1:01:18.360 --> 1:01:25.120]  to zap travelers with MRI style scans Janet Napolitano's promise that
[1:01:25.120 --> 1:01:28.800]  Americans won't be forced to remove their shoes comes at a price this is a
[1:01:28.800 --> 1:01:35.520]  big deal because the company they're tapping some of the companies are tapping
[1:01:35.520 --> 1:01:40.760]  admit this is an MRI type technology and then Watson gets into the fact the New
[1:01:40.760 --> 1:01:44.640]  York Times and others admit MRIs are giving people cancer and are super high
[1:01:44.640 --> 1:01:48.360]  power when they're not calibrated right actually fry people the hair all falls
[1:01:48.360 --> 1:01:54.760]  out it's so powerful meaning it's killing fast growing cells you know hair
[1:01:54.760 --> 1:01:59.280]  intestine cells things like that are the fastest growing some of the fastest
[1:01:59.280 --> 1:02:02.480]  growing that's why when you get radiation exposure your teeth fall out
[1:02:02.480 --> 1:02:08.040]  your gums start bleeding you your hair falls out it hits fast growing cells
[1:02:08.040 --> 1:02:16.200]  are the easiest to wipe out with radiation also cells that don't replicate
[1:02:16.200 --> 1:02:22.680]  are hit like like ice your retina the cones the rods the pickup color and dark
[1:02:22.680 --> 1:02:29.520]  and light they're just absolutely devastated by radiation you know they
[1:02:29.520 --> 1:02:33.200]  admit cataracts are from exposure to Sun over your life that's why sunglasses are
[1:02:33.200 --> 1:02:38.560]  good to his really bright Sun but but you know that's just a little bit of
[1:02:38.560 --> 1:02:41.400]  solar radiation you imagine going through these in fact they got ready
[1:02:41.400 --> 1:02:45.160]  radiation experts the government quoted John Hopkins and saying these were safe
[1:02:45.160 --> 1:02:48.840]  and actually said no this is gonna give you skin cancer our report said the
[1:02:48.840 --> 1:02:54.000]  opposite the government's lying and by the way you better close your eyes when
[1:02:54.000 --> 1:02:57.120]  you go in these because just that little piece of skin will help but not
[1:02:57.120 --> 1:03:02.520]  entirely this is gonna fry your rods and your cones so you like goes in just
[1:03:02.520 --> 1:03:06.680]  like the new high-tech 35 millimeter cameras they've got it doesn't go
[1:03:06.680 --> 1:03:10.440]  through the lens and hit a mirror and go into a chip it goes directly on to the
[1:03:10.440 --> 1:03:14.840]  chip that's mimicking the human eye and when light comes into the eye it on the
[1:03:14.840 --> 1:03:20.000]  back of the eye on the inside are all these cells and they tried to mimic
[1:03:20.000 --> 1:03:23.520]  those of microchips they're doing a pretty darn good job now wow technology
[1:03:23.520 --> 1:03:28.400]  is incredible and so here's the back of the eye and those light comes in well
[1:03:28.400 --> 1:03:33.920]  it's not designed for radiation you know high-powered radiation to come in and
[1:03:33.920 --> 1:03:38.320]  head and just fries them but hey who needs eyesight in fact I saw another
[1:03:38.320 --> 1:03:42.440]  study the TSA people are getting cataracts you know after five years of
[1:03:42.440 --> 1:03:45.920]  working there of course you're gonna get cataracts of course you guys are
[1:03:45.920 --> 1:03:54.640]  getting wet macular degeneration about half the people I talked to including
[1:03:54.640 --> 1:04:01.360]  young women are getting all sorts of degenerative neurological disorders I
[1:04:01.360 --> 1:04:04.840]  mean they're just murdering the hell out of us all these famous tennis players

[1:04:15.220 --> 1:04:26.000]  guion beret I mean read the insert the globalist got caught with Hitler
[1:04:26.000 --> 1:04:28.440]  killing people too quickly and they just said we're just gonna start spiking
[1:04:28.440 --> 1:04:31.440]  the food and water and just slowly start killing people and see if they notice
[1:04:31.440 --> 1:04:35.400]  as we slowly start killing people once it gets to fever pitch it'll just be
[1:04:35.400 --> 1:04:39.800]  normal yeah I'm dying of cancer so is my neighbor yeah I had three kids hoping
[1:04:39.800 --> 1:04:43.800]  one of them live you know most people die cancer now it's completely normal how

[1:04:56.160 --> 1:05:02.080]  Jones present planet TV present planet TV this is Alex Jones with five good
[1:05:02.080 --> 1:05:06.080]  reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator number one new
[1:05:06.080 --> 1:05:09.880]  climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill number two
[1:05:09.880 --> 1:05:13.960]  our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company
[1:05:13.960 --> 1:05:18.040]  allows you to have it's true total government control of electricity in
[1:05:18.040 --> 1:05:22.400]  the name of smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of
[1:05:22.400 --> 1:05:25.880]  the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new
[1:05:25.880 --> 1:05:29.640]  socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[1:05:29.640 --> 1:05:33.720]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[1:05:33.720 --> 1:05:37.480]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar
[1:05:37.480 --> 1:05:41.520]  power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I
[1:05:41.520 --> 1:05:44.240]  really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from
[1:05:44.240 --> 1:05:50.280]  science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com

[1:05:59.800 --> 1:06:03.720]  hello friends Alex Jones here you all know I've worked for years with Steve
[1:06:03.720 --> 1:06:08.080]  shank and he foods direct I have e-foods for my own emergency food supply you know
[1:06:08.080 --> 1:06:12.080]  Steve life is different now for all of us isn't it very different people are
[1:06:12.080 --> 1:06:15.800]  using this great food to survive the present hurricane season and we've
[1:06:15.800 --> 1:06:20.800]  already had 40 billion dollars worth of damage from floods storms quakes and
[1:06:20.800 --> 1:06:24.840]  droughts and that's just the first eight months of this year natural disasters

[1:08:43.320 --> 1:08:47.160]  in fact I know that's in Watson's article but when you guys search New
[1:08:47.160 --> 1:08:54.240]  York Times MRIs causing cancer MRIs making hair fall out and then when I get
[1:08:54.240 --> 1:08:58.640]  to it we'll show some of that we've got him going after Ron Paul he won the NBC
[1:08:58.640 --> 1:09:02.440]  poll by more than double so they they manipulated the graphs to make it look
[1:09:02.440 --> 1:09:06.280]  like he barely won and then totally ignored him in multiple news articles
[1:09:06.280 --> 1:09:10.160]  just didn't even mention him like he didn't exist boy that tells you he's the
[1:09:10.160 --> 1:09:13.880]  good guy but if you want to buy a bridge on the moon I'm happy to sell your Rick
[1:09:13.880 --> 1:09:22.480]  Perry let's go ahead now and go back to your calls let's talk to Luke in South
[1:09:22.480 --> 1:09:29.760]  Korea you're on the air go ahead good morning Alex how are you good okay I'm
[1:09:29.760 --> 1:09:33.520]  calling up to give you an update on what's happening in Australia but the
[1:09:33.520 --> 1:09:37.360]  case they're an Aboriginal teenager who's been accused of Australia's rarest
[1:09:37.360 --> 1:09:42.260]  crime according to the Bureau of Government Statistics and it's also the
[1:09:42.260 --> 1:09:48.500]  first domestic terrorism outlaw motorcycle gang targeted legislation
[1:09:48.500 --> 1:09:55.520]  down there now this crime is probably a hundred times rarer than murder now it's
[1:09:55.520 --> 1:09:59.920]  also been used against me but I was outside Australian jurisdiction when
[1:09:59.920 --> 1:10:05.640]  my house was raided state overseas ever since in exile well I won't go into my
[1:10:05.640 --> 1:10:09.680]  case because it's all it's not very politically incorrect but there is a
[1:10:09.680 --> 1:10:14.720]  video of me burning my Australian passport you know at the Australian
[1:10:14.720 --> 1:10:19.160]  Embassy in Beijing if your listeners just pipe in burn passport as one word
[1:10:19.160 --> 1:10:23.360]  they will be able to see no no you always call in with the same subject and I
[1:10:23.360 --> 1:10:28.120]  know now if you criticize somebody for their sexual gender on Facebook they
[1:10:28.120 --> 1:10:33.400]  come and arrest you the officers that you criticize come and arrest you and it's
[1:10:33.400 --> 1:10:37.640]  similar to life in prison for videotaping police here in the US they just don't
[1:10:37.640 --> 1:10:41.880]  care they're out of control political correctness is the new the new tyranny
[1:10:41.880 --> 1:10:47.120]  so what's the update Luke okay the update is I wanted to get the world
[1:10:47.120 --> 1:10:50.800]  media to cover this because it is proceeding before the courts the police
[1:10:50.800 --> 1:10:56.520]  haven't dropped the charges and it's one point I didn't make very clear a
[1:10:56.520 --> 1:11:02.080]  couple of months ago when I was on your show and that is that the state
[1:11:02.080 --> 1:11:06.920]  itself has put out a press release and in that press release you mentioned last
[1:11:06.920 --> 1:11:11.480]  time they and I want to say that this whole story is on the prison planet
[1:11:11.480 --> 1:11:16.040]  forums and the under the international news section under general discussion if
[1:11:16.040 --> 1:11:20.480]  your listeners want to do the research but in the government press release they
[1:11:20.480 --> 1:11:25.840]  said the exact minute the offense was allegedly made the government
[1:11:25.840 --> 1:11:30.920]  broadcast the name the actual Facebook group the comment was in and Google
[1:11:30.920 --> 1:11:36.080]  Corporation took a snapshot of the page long before the boys arrest that was
[1:11:36.080 --> 1:11:44.080]  state online and in that at the exact same minute mentioned in the police
[1:11:44.080 --> 1:11:50.400]  press release all the boy did was call a officer gay and at the basis of the
[1:11:50.400 --> 1:11:56.000]  charge the definition of the law is obtain true personal information on a
[1:11:56.000 --> 1:12:00.280]  law enforcement officer so this officer no I know I know I know they're making
[1:12:00.280 --> 1:12:04.040]  government God I appreciate your call I've I've seen the case we've we've
[1:12:04.040 --> 1:12:07.800]  covered it same stuff's being set up in Europe they're openly saying arrest
[1:12:07.800 --> 1:12:10.840]  people that don't believe in man-made global warming the White House
[1:12:10.840 --> 1:12:15.600]  regulations are is trying to get laws passed these people are tyrants these
[1:12:15.600 --> 1:12:19.880]  people know what they're doing and you know they sell the public on well it's
[1:12:19.880 --> 1:12:24.440]  politically correct well if you take one groups rights that you even
[1:12:24.440 --> 1:12:30.120]  disagree with their right to free speech all of you lose your rights let's go
[1:12:30.120 --> 1:12:38.720]  ahead and go to Judy in Florida Judy you're on the air welcome Alex hi great
[1:12:38.720 --> 1:12:45.240]  talk to you I've been listening for a couple of years now I am I watched not
[1:12:45.240 --> 1:12:54.280]  live but through video the Republican debate and I noticed that Dr. Paul was
[1:12:54.280 --> 1:13:01.720]  basically on camera maybe six seven times he was the only candidate that I
[1:13:01.720 --> 1:13:06.160]  saw that you know got cut off in the middle of saying what he had to say and
[1:13:06.160 --> 1:13:14.080]  that he was basically you know ignore or you know chided well I watched it I
[1:13:14.080 --> 1:13:17.880]  watched it I watched it you know after we taped it because I was on my own TV
[1:13:17.880 --> 1:13:21.160]  show at the time but I didn't watch the whole debate and I do have some clips
[1:13:21.160 --> 1:13:26.320]  we're gonna be playing later in this hour and into the next hour but that is
[1:13:26.320 --> 1:13:34.920]  what they did and it didn't matter he still won by more than 50% he got he got
[1:13:34.920 --> 1:13:42.840]  more votes than all the other candidates combined and how did NBC respond they
[1:13:42.840 --> 1:13:45.840]  responded by doctoring the poll where even though he got more than all the
[1:13:45.840 --> 1:13:52.520]  others combined he's only a little bit above the next guy Mitt Romney okay here's
[1:13:52.520 --> 1:13:56.920]  Ron Paul with 50 something Mitt Romney's got 18 and Ron Paul's barely above him
[1:13:56.920 --> 1:14:01.560]  all these graphs all these articles are on info wars.com right now and then how
[1:14:01.560 --> 1:14:07.640]  does NBC respond NBC in this article doesn't let me just give me the article
[1:14:07.640 --> 1:14:15.640]  it's first thoughts slugfest in semi at the Ronald Reagan library nothing about
[1:14:15.640 --> 1:14:22.000]  Ron Paul Ron Paul's name is not in here now now does that show you how scared
[1:14:22.000 --> 1:14:25.240]  they are that they know he could become the next president so they beat this
[1:14:25.240 --> 1:14:29.000]  mantra he can't win and he wins the New Hampshire straw nobody covers it
[1:14:29.000 --> 1:14:32.640]  statistical tie with Bachman who bought 4,000 votes over 90% of the votes she
[1:14:32.640 --> 1:14:40.520]  got still ignoring this is what they do this is what they do go ahead I'm
[1:14:40.520 --> 1:14:43.720]  definitely concerned for Congressman Paul because I really believe that there
[1:14:43.720 --> 1:14:48.200]  are enough people awake and understand exactly what we're up against that he
[1:14:48.200 --> 1:14:52.120]  has a very good chance of winning and what could happen to him later on is
[1:14:52.120 --> 1:14:58.080]  what I'm you know quite concerned with because he's you know he's he tells the
[1:14:58.080 --> 1:15:03.800]  truth he's a man of integrity and he pulls no punches he knows you know what
[1:15:03.800 --> 1:15:09.880]  we're up against he's you've had him on your show yourself so I mean he needs
[1:15:09.880 --> 1:15:15.440]  he needs our prayers and protection and you know I really believe he's the only
[1:15:15.440 --> 1:15:21.120]  person that could really bring about any type of change that Americans are
[1:15:21.120 --> 1:15:28.600]  interested in I hear you Donna and or Judy Donna's next there's there's no
[1:15:28.600 --> 1:15:34.240]  doubt that Ron Paul's the real deal that's why the establishment acts like
[1:15:34.240 --> 1:15:37.960]  he doesn't exist when they're forced to cover him they say he can't win when he
[1:15:37.960 --> 1:15:42.080]  does win they don't report it when he wins the straw poll Fox dubs in fake
[1:15:42.080 --> 1:15:47.920]  booze and when he wins the CPAC poll tears in a row it's left right center
[1:15:47.920 --> 1:15:52.760]  they all attacking they've got armies it's turned out paid fake bloggers
[1:15:52.760 --> 1:15:56.520]  attacking him and others they've got people out there claiming you know that
[1:15:56.520 --> 1:16:00.480]  he's part of the New World Order or works for the Tooth Fairy under Vatican
[1:16:00.480 --> 1:16:04.660]  assassin directive all of this to heading from every angle what did Cass
[1:16:04.660 --> 1:16:09.320]  Funstein say three years ago the even before he got into office the White House
[1:16:09.320 --> 1:16:12.920]  regulations are he said we have no credibility in the mainstream media we've
[1:16:12.920 --> 1:16:17.240]  been caught lying he said we've got to pose as conspiracy theorist that's
[1:16:17.240 --> 1:16:21.000]  people that question known liars questioning known liars which is common
[1:16:21.000 --> 1:16:25.040]  sense and actually learning how the world really works that is heresy that is
[1:16:25.040 --> 1:16:29.840]  mental illness now with TSA if you say I don't like you grabbing my genitals they

[1:17:43.040 --> 1:17:49.240]  understanding of anything I mean if you can say two plus two equals four you
[1:17:49.240 --> 1:17:57.240]  are al-Qaeda and I'm not joking there you know you read 1984 and the more I've
[1:17:57.240 --> 1:18:00.960]  read it probably seven eight times now seen the film several times but I can't
[1:18:00.960 --> 1:18:05.360]  watch it or read any more because it's too painful now I actually weep if I
[1:18:05.360 --> 1:18:10.720]  watch the road because it's so accurate to what could happen to our society I've
[1:18:10.720 --> 1:18:16.120]  watched it one time and it's so realistic to what's happened within 15 days of a
[1:18:16.120 --> 1:18:20.800]  society collapsing that I think about it all the time I can't watch it again I
[1:18:20.800 --> 1:18:25.200]  studied too much history haven't experienced that just knowing history it
[1:18:25.200 --> 1:18:28.440]  is so horrifying we've now been maneuvered into this position of total
[1:18:28.440 --> 1:18:38.760]  dependence and I have I've read 1984 and again he worked for the Imperial police
[1:18:38.760 --> 1:18:43.840]  in India he was an Imperial enforcer then he got upset by that and thought I'll
[1:18:43.840 --> 1:18:46.920]  join the communist I'm against the Empire and he found out they were just as
[1:18:46.920 --> 1:18:51.560]  bad in finance by the same big banks fought the Spanish Civil War got shot
[1:18:51.560 --> 1:18:56.680]  to the throat you know fighting Franco forces went back worked in BBC propaganda
[1:18:56.680 --> 1:19:00.520]  found out it was corrupt never at war with East Asia always at war with East
[1:19:00.520 --> 1:19:10.280]  Asia wrote 1984 died a year later 1949 and when they're torturing Winston he
[1:19:10.280 --> 1:19:14.440]  says freedom is the ability to say two plus two equals four and O'Brien goes
[1:19:14.440 --> 1:19:18.560]  you're absolutely right pal we're gonna totally torture you and starve you till
[1:19:18.560 --> 1:19:21.800]  you have a mental break and can't tell two plus two equals four anymore and
[1:19:21.800 --> 1:19:25.800]  you're gonna mentally get off on thinking it means five six or whatever I
[1:19:25.800 --> 1:19:30.520]  say you're going to make the mental calculation to not be able to think
[1:19:30.520 --> 1:19:34.440]  anymore and face evil anymore now I'm gonna torture you for a couple months
[1:19:34.440 --> 1:19:38.000]  you ready for this and he stands him up when he finally breaks him he says
[1:19:38.000 --> 1:19:42.560]  you're the last man huh pulls his teeth out and he finally breaks him and at the
[1:19:42.560 --> 1:19:47.400]  end Winston who's very intelligent learns how to love evil learns how to oh
[1:19:47.400 --> 1:19:52.240]  du's good for me radiation from Fukushima is good TSA groping

[1:24:43.720 --> 1:24:49.960]  the day of 9-11 she went ahead and broke her federal gag order and went public
[1:24:49.960 --> 1:24:53.960]  in another federal court case because she was under oath she was able to cover
[1:24:53.960 --> 1:25:00.760]  it that's the kind of stuff why would they seal it ten years after Al Qaeda's
[1:25:00.760 --> 1:25:06.760]  attack on the United States what's wrong with that first line we just are told
[1:25:06.760 --> 1:25:11.360]  by known liars that oh they killed bin Laden and threw his body in the ocean and
[1:25:11.360 --> 1:25:16.280]  did a fake situation room photo op that's now admitted and oh bin Laden didn't

[1:33:43.480 --> 1:33:49.920]  over again telling us ridiculous fables and and and more and more just
[1:33:49.920 --> 1:33:54.240]  inoculating the public psychologically to accept it it's like Governor Ridge two
[1:33:54.240 --> 1:33:58.360]  years ago former head of Homeland Security writes a book and says yeah we
[1:33:58.360 --> 1:34:04.440]  shoot terror alerts for no reason to distract people politically
[1:34:04.680 --> 1:34:09.560]  it's like Obama yeah I'm giving waivers to all my friends from all these big

[1:34:45.960 --> 1:34:51.400]  of government and and and I see Americans just kiss up to the lowliest

[1:34:56.080 --> 1:35:01.720]  nice to them and then the bureaucrats are all just on power trips when the same
[1:35:01.720 --> 1:35:08.440]  idiotic bureaucrats are all under the same assault their dollars being
[1:35:08.440 --> 1:35:12.680]  devalued their jobs are being off-source their futures being destroyed their
[1:35:12.680 --> 1:35:16.960]  waters being spiked their foods being engineered their families getting all
[1:35:16.960 --> 1:35:24.480]  these new diseases and problems and it's just a nation of people in a trance a
[1:35:24.480 --> 1:35:28.800]  bunch of television watching people who aren't even living in reality like
[1:35:28.800 --> 1:35:31.920]  lemmings off the edge of a cliff and then there's those of us that have
[1:35:31.920 --> 1:35:37.040]  awoken to this and we don't want to be part of it we want to try to reverse it
[1:35:37.040 --> 1:35:40.800]  and the system tells the dumbed-down mass those are the bad people they don't

[1:36:40.160 --> 1:36:45.480]  screams and yells and belly aches and says don't you know talk about freedom
[1:36:45.480 --> 1:36:48.320]  you want violence even if you don't talk about violence they go you don't like
[1:36:48.320 --> 1:36:51.040]  the Federal Reserve running things you're a right-wing extremist I'm like
[1:36:51.040 --> 1:36:55.400]  no I I'm not part of your labels I'm into freedom now I can know you're
[1:36:55.400 --> 1:36:59.360]  wanting violence MSNBC comes here for hardball you you want violence don't
[1:36:59.360 --> 1:37:03.360]  you don't like no I don't want violence or go guess you do but then this guy
[1:37:03.360 --> 1:37:06.680]  they come in he goes no I'm just showing you know the building on fire you know
[1:37:06.680 --> 1:37:12.520]  they said well do you hate them he goes no I just don't like criminals and then
[1:37:12.520 --> 1:37:17.040]  he got to visit his house and I told you they got a lot of attention especially
[1:37:17.040 --> 1:37:24.240]  once it was here $25,000 on your on your eBay situation so that's a very
[1:37:24.240 --> 1:37:29.960]  exciting mr. Schaefer oh my I can't even tell you Alex it's I'm completely
[1:37:29.960 --> 1:37:37.640]  flabbergasted and I'm in a daze right now it's you know I miss your calls the
[1:37:37.640 --> 1:37:40.920]  first time you called like about three minutes ago it's actually talking to the
[1:37:40.920 --> 1:37:46.120]  buyer I mean it's all real I feel like I'm in I'm having a dream or something
[1:37:46.120 --> 1:37:51.120]  what can you tell us about the buyer without saying their name well they
[1:37:51.120 --> 1:37:55.400]  told me that they wanted to remain anonymous so I'm not exactly sure but
[1:37:55.400 --> 1:38:01.280]  they are they're they're in Europe they're European buyer and there were
[1:38:01.280 --> 1:38:07.240]  basically two people at the end who are really rallying for the peace and and
[1:38:07.240 --> 1:38:10.800]  then when I just spoke to them on Skype right now just to start working out
[1:38:10.800 --> 1:38:16.480]  money details they just they just picked up the story they thought it they
[1:38:16.480 --> 1:38:21.320]  just think it's it was a heroic act you know and for me it was just such a
[1:38:21.320 --> 1:38:27.760]  humble thing to do and I'm completely humbled by all this attention and well
[1:38:27.760 --> 1:38:35.440]  I suggest I suggest you take part of your winnings and part of your earnings
[1:38:35.440 --> 1:38:39.320]  and travel to Europe to hand deliver it as we tell you how the globalist operate
[1:38:39.320 --> 1:38:43.640]  they they know ideas are bulletproof they know ideas are real power that's
[1:38:43.640 --> 1:38:51.480]  what they use lies we'll wound up in in in all their packaging to psychically
[1:38:51.480 --> 1:38:58.080]  disable us and destabilize everybody they're afraid of ideas that's why
[1:38:58.080 --> 1:39:01.840]  they're doing this that's why they're that's why they're coming after you yeah
[1:39:01.840 --> 1:39:08.320]  yeah and you know we're gonna do a gold money transfer so it's gonna be an
[1:39:08.320 --> 1:39:14.840]  alternative form of payment which I think is just fantastic well I would
[1:39:14.840 --> 1:39:18.440]  expand on that you can also get insured groups to ship the painting over there
[1:39:18.440 --> 1:39:21.400]  you might do it in somebody else's name I'm just telling you I've seen the
[1:39:21.400 --> 1:39:25.480]  globalist try all sorts of dirty tricks or they could impound the painting but
[1:39:25.480 --> 1:39:31.160]  that'd be even better their tyranny only you know only only illustrates it in
[1:39:31.160 --> 1:39:35.360]  this period while we still have a lot of liberty and people are waking up if
[1:39:35.360 --> 1:39:39.920]  they bring in the total tyranny then the great darkness comes so now is the time
[1:39:39.920 --> 1:39:45.880]  to do what you've done yeah you know what I'm planning to do with with some
[1:39:45.880 --> 1:39:51.160]  of these earnings is I want to do I want to take a worldwide burning bank tour
[1:39:51.160 --> 1:39:55.920]  get an itinerary from I don't know Max Kaiser or something just the best of the
[1:39:55.920 --> 1:40:00.920]  worst banks around the world plan a trip and and then kind of take this idea
[1:40:00.920 --> 1:40:05.760]  to to a foreign country you know Max we never really did any pre interviews
[1:40:05.760 --> 1:40:12.040]  with you so I never really asked much about you but Alex but when you bring
[1:40:12.040 --> 1:40:16.960]  up Max Kaiser that rings the bell here he's one of our guests were you
[1:40:16.960 --> 1:40:21.880]  familiar with this radio show before we ever called you oh I've been free I've
[1:40:21.880 --> 1:40:26.360]  been following Max I've been a fan of Max Kaiser's website for a long time and
[1:40:26.360 --> 1:40:33.880]  yours well so I so I remember sending him I did this JPEG of an image of Lloyd
[1:40:33.880 --> 1:40:38.960]  Blankfine photo shot onto the body of like a jihadist with a machine gun
[1:40:38.960 --> 1:40:44.280]  understanding in front of the suicide banker and I remember sending that to
[1:40:44.280 --> 1:40:48.040]  Max Kaiser like two years ago and he just loved it because you can get on it
[1:40:48.040 --> 1:40:53.000]  you know as the graphic for some of his links and things well yeah well look
[1:40:53.000 --> 1:40:58.480]  Chase Chase is burning down our schools burning down our communities
[1:40:58.480 --> 1:41:02.920]  burning down the value of our dollar and and and pushing all their globalist
[1:41:02.920 --> 1:41:09.640]  carbon taxes they fund anti-gun groups so so Chase Chase is destroying the
[1:41:09.640 --> 1:41:16.600]  middle of rights and Constitution and I do want to talk to you off-air about a
[1:41:16.600 --> 1:41:20.880]  few ideas that I've got because we all just go ahead and propose it here on
[1:41:20.880 --> 1:41:24.320]  air and then once I do this on air you'll have 50 people call you because
[1:41:24.320 --> 1:41:29.080]  anything I do people try to angle in on and I'm very very busy with a lot of
[1:41:29.080 --> 1:41:36.240]  the projects but I myself am a painter I know you said that and I I do the you
[1:41:36.240 --> 1:41:42.560]  know impressionistic stuff but you also representational I mean I mean I run the
[1:41:42.560 --> 1:41:49.480]  gamut I do pen and inks oil acrylic wood carving everything I just have to do
[1:41:49.480 --> 1:41:51.760]  it quick because I don't have a lot of time on the weekend while I'm doing my
[1:41:51.760 --> 1:41:55.600]  kids I'll work maybe an hour or two a weekend but but I'm gonna launch a art
[1:41:55.600 --> 1:42:00.320]  website with political stuff non-political stuff and and and start
[1:42:00.320 --> 1:42:05.200]  actually selling political art and I and I think instead of building up all my
[1:42:05.200 --> 1:42:08.360]  pieces which end up giving to family and folks and I hoard them the problem is I
[1:42:08.360 --> 1:42:12.280]  don't want to sell my stuff but also get the images out there we should talk
[1:42:12.280 --> 1:42:17.600]  about launching my art website next week and I'll guarantee you that if you
[1:42:17.600 --> 1:42:21.520]  paint five or six more of those but but but but but give it more of a meal
[1:42:21.520 --> 1:42:26.680]  moderate price you know a few are variants that but a limited number
[1:42:26.680 --> 1:42:30.640]  Sam's painting five more across the street you know in in a different
[1:42:30.640 --> 1:42:34.680]  variants I guarantee you we can sell all of them in a week and then that'll
[1:42:34.680 --> 1:42:38.880]  fund our operation fighting tyranny it'll fund you because I think what
[1:42:38.880 --> 1:42:45.120]  you're doing there is just the beginning of the potential and but but I
[1:42:45.120 --> 1:42:48.440]  wouldn't just go with this and then go on some little tour and then kind of get
[1:42:48.440 --> 1:42:51.680]  a little bit of attention I would I would launch it now while the market's
[1:42:51.680 --> 1:42:56.440]  there and establish yourself so so if you know I'm not certainly not van goes
[1:42:56.440 --> 1:43:00.440]  brother and art dealer but if you want me to to launch some of your paintings
[1:43:00.440 --> 1:43:04.680]  let's get on the phone today and and let's just hammer it out and do it
[1:43:04.680 --> 1:43:10.280]  cool man we'll talk follow me I got my phone on well I'm gonna get off at about
[1:43:10.280 --> 1:43:13.120]  two o'clock but I mean again I'm just I'm going ahead and throwing this out
[1:43:13.120 --> 1:43:18.800]  around the open this will work in and will be successful and also
[1:43:18.800 --> 1:43:23.800]  will infuriate the power structure but you know when it gets down to horse
[1:43:23.800 --> 1:43:28.800]  trading let's just nail it down and do it fantastic well I'm gonna be enjoying
[1:43:28.800 --> 1:43:34.720]  myself on my friend's show today let's paint TV so so that's gonna be a blast I
[1:43:34.720 --> 1:43:39.080]  can't wait it's like gonna be a nice little after party here all right Alex
[1:43:39.080 --> 1:43:43.120]  that's good news take care buddy thank you very much have a great day you bet
[1:43:43.120 --> 1:43:47.800]  I've actually done paintings of Dick Cheney and Barack Obama as demons and
[1:43:47.800 --> 1:43:53.880]  things but it's pretty ugly and I normally paint pretty things and I know
[1:43:53.880 --> 1:43:57.240]  that when we bring them out it's gonna be a big hit and be a big capital driver
[1:43:57.240 --> 1:44:01.840]  for this show you know he was like I hope we get $5,000 he was almost last week I
[1:44:01.840 --> 1:44:06.840]  said dude you're gonna get 20,000 50,000 on your painting but the key is to keep
[1:44:06.840 --> 1:44:11.840]  that momentum going and again Liberty is popular they teach us we're supposed
[1:44:11.840 --> 1:44:16.400]  to be losers and fail I'll guarantee you the guy that bought that painting years
[1:44:16.400 --> 1:44:20.120]  from now is gonna make triple as money on it because we're going to take
[1:44:20.120 --> 1:44:25.960]  society in the world back if we don't there's no future anyways okay let's go
[1:44:25.960 --> 1:44:34.200]  ahead and go back to your phone calls let's go ahead and talk to Pearson
[1:44:34.200 --> 1:44:40.720]  Florida you're on the air welcome hi Alex I have four ideas to help Ron Paul's
[1:44:40.720 --> 1:44:46.160]  campaign I'd like to go over the first idea would be a revised version of the
[1:44:46.160 --> 1:44:51.320]  Obama deception that incorporates Rick Perry and Mitt Romney it kind of really
[1:44:51.320 --> 1:44:56.360]  connects them and kind of really digs down and goes at them out of the second
[1:44:56.360 --> 1:45:01.720]  idea would be more Google bombs that pertain towards hit pieces on Rick
[1:45:01.720 --> 1:45:11.880]  Perry Mitt Romney the third idea would be more for the revolution back I'd like
[1:45:11.880 --> 1:45:17.600]  to see like a 30-minute infomercial that would really help sell Ron Paul the
[1:45:17.600 --> 1:45:23.400]  last idea would be like Ron Paul 10 just like your info wars 10 but we get
[1:45:23.400 --> 1:45:27.560]  them out leaving that restaurant anything of that nature they'll start
[1:45:27.560 --> 1:45:33.520]  circulating I think that's a good idea but look resistance is victory just
[1:45:33.520 --> 1:45:37.880]  standing up speaking out getting involved saying no the globalist put this
[1:45:37.880 --> 1:45:42.800]  archetypal false image in our mind that some hero like Hercules archetype is
[1:45:42.800 --> 1:45:46.800]  gonna have to defeat everything and then cut the monsters head off no it's a
[1:45:46.800 --> 1:45:50.720]  process not fighting with your wife not fighting with your husband getting
[1:45:50.720 --> 1:45:57.200]  healthier having love in your heart having courage valuing liberty instead of
[1:45:57.200 --> 1:46:06.360]  bobbles and crud valuing ideas the globalist spend 25 30 40 50 million on a
[1:46:06.360 --> 1:46:10.840]  goblet of pus and maggots that's the most popular stuff in in New York art
[1:46:10.840 --> 1:46:16.520]  sales with the elites and they admit it's a sacrament they are donating to
[1:46:16.520 --> 1:46:20.800]  their idol of ugliness and death and saying this has value this money we
[1:46:20.800 --> 1:46:25.520]  stole from all these people's houses we took you know I'm a broker I want you
[1:46:25.520 --> 1:46:29.120]  know all this death motif I mean the New York Times admits that's what's popular
[1:46:29.120 --> 1:46:36.280]  them you know cans of of of gorilla dung you know ten thousand a piece you
[1:46:36.280 --> 1:46:40.160]  know can't sell enough of them that's what the elites want to buy well we have
[1:46:40.160 --> 1:46:45.120]  to get the nouveau riche and and the middle class and the new wealth who
[1:46:45.120 --> 1:46:49.880]  aren't globalist they have to start giving to campaigns supporting local
[1:46:49.880 --> 1:46:53.400]  radio starting their own radio shows starting their own news sites starting a
[1:46:53.400 --> 1:46:58.320]  local newspaper even if it loses money the first five years buying our videos
[1:46:58.320 --> 1:47:04.920]  putting them on local TV buying art supporting ideas this is this is a this
[1:47:04.920 --> 1:47:11.600]  is a war of ideas that's why they're so scared of ideas anything else sir I know
[1:47:11.600 --> 1:47:15.880]  that's it thank you I appreciate your call let's go to Donna in Texas Donna
[1:47:15.880 --> 1:47:23.320]  you're on the air hi Alex hi hi this may be a premature statement but in
[1:47:23.320 --> 1:47:28.360]  lieu of what the media is doing to Ron Paul I have made the decision not to
[1:47:28.360 --> 1:47:32.480]  vote for the lesser of two evils this time around and I will be writing Ron
[1:47:32.480 --> 1:47:36.760]  Paul in and I hope that if it comes down to that a lot of the other Ron Paul
[1:47:36.760 --> 1:47:41.520]  you supporters will be doing the same no I think that's a great way to
[1:47:41.520 --> 1:47:46.000]  illustrate things and again remember even if they cheat even the electronic
[1:47:46.000 --> 1:47:51.160]  machines kick in areas and stop him he's in there showing how they're trying to
[1:47:51.160 --> 1:47:55.960]  block him and lying on polls and totally ignoring him even when he wins he's
[1:47:55.960 --> 1:48:00.880]  bringing up real issues in the hypocrisy and think three and a half years ago got
[1:48:00.880 --> 1:48:04.440]  a lot of attention he's probably even with the attempted blackout getting ten
[1:48:04.440 --> 1:48:08.880]  times the coverage and ten times the effect and the seeds he plants now and
[1:48:08.880 --> 1:48:14.040]  we plant now go on it's the willingness to struggle life is a struggle winning
[1:48:14.040 --> 1:48:18.880]  is just surviving winning is passing on your genetics winning is passing on the
[1:48:18.880 --> 1:48:23.320]  ideas of liberty winning is resisting winning is thriving people just think
[1:48:23.320 --> 1:48:27.400]  it's like oh gosh there's tyranny I got to fight it that's the great animating
[1:48:27.400 --> 1:48:31.960]  challenge that the founders talked about we are living in history right now I
[1:48:31.960 --> 1:48:38.000]  mean it's exciting that they could kill me or set me up I mean even if they got
[1:48:38.000 --> 1:48:41.600]  me hung upside down torturing me that's that's pretty exciting I mean I'm
[1:48:41.600 --> 1:48:46.760]  I'm I've got the head of Homeland Security attacking me and attacking
[1:48:46.760 --> 1:48:50.880]  others in the White House attacking us and you know the enemy's list and
[1:48:50.880 --> 1:48:53.720]  everything else and I don't look forward to any of it but it's all part of the
[1:48:53.720 --> 1:48:59.640]  great challenge I mean I'll be 85 years older 90 someday going into a heart
[1:48:59.640 --> 1:49:03.600]  attack and you know incredible pain there or in a hospital bed hooked up with
[1:49:03.600 --> 1:49:08.800]  wires you know battling cancer so why am I scared of jackboots knocking my teeth
[1:49:08.800 --> 1:49:13.920]  out and globalists are knocking their teeth out knocking their DNA out I look
[1:49:13.920 --> 1:49:18.080]  at these people as moron victims these are just ring-raith servants who already
[1:49:18.080 --> 1:49:23.320]  lost their soul we've already won just by doing the right thing we win just by
[1:49:23.320 --> 1:49:29.360]  choosing goodness and honor in history we win we win we win it's beautiful we
[1:49:29.360 --> 1:49:34.200]  can't be defeated this is life is all a great test a great challenge do you hear
[1:49:34.200 --> 1:49:38.600]  what I'm saying Donna yes Alex I do but a main thing I want to let people know
[1:49:38.600 --> 1:49:42.200]  is because a lot of people may be ignorant like I was is that they always
[1:49:42.200 --> 1:49:46.440]  think that they have to vote for who's on the ballot that's not true there is a
[1:49:46.440 --> 1:49:50.680]  place for a write-in and everybody needs to remember that I agree with you but
[1:49:50.680 --> 1:49:55.720]  but more than that Donna run for office locally it may take you five six times
[1:49:55.720 --> 1:50:00.920]  of running before you win but if enough of us run a lot of us will win you can
[1:50:00.920 --> 1:50:05.840]  also run and do what they do but the opposite don't be deceptive though but
[1:50:05.840 --> 1:50:12.160]  don't completely come out with just how anti-neural order you are just kind of
[1:50:12.160 --> 1:50:19.160]  give mainline conservative answers because that's what they do that like
[1:50:19.160 --> 1:50:22.840]  they're patriotic and then get in their globalist operatives you just come in
[1:50:22.840 --> 1:50:25.760]  you only do it at lower office because once they figure out who you really are
[1:50:25.760 --> 1:50:28.320]  then they're gonna come after you but by then you'll already have the first
[1:50:28.320 --> 1:50:32.640]  office now you can get into higher office but just you know kind of be
[1:50:32.640 --> 1:50:38.120]  mainline pro-liberty but really don't tell them when I get in here I'm gonna
[1:50:38.120 --> 1:50:42.140]  start investigations I'm gonna call for prosecutions I'm gonna use I'm gonna go
[1:50:42.140 --> 1:50:48.480]  after all of you sleeper cells in political systems we all show need that
[1:50:48.480 --> 1:50:52.320]  choose which route you're gonna go on pray to God ask for guidance are you
[1:50:52.320 --> 1:50:57.000]  gonna be out in the open or are you gonna have a stealth candidacy are you
[1:50:57.000 --> 1:51:00.840]  gonna fight fire with fire there's more than one way to skin a cat

[1:54:55.240 --> 1:54:59.360]  will get into the rest of news we haven't covered and I'll play the Ron Paul
[1:54:59.360 --> 1:55:02.720]  clips gonna be a jam-packed third hour as it always is I wanted to briefly bring
[1:55:02.720 --> 1:55:07.040]  up Ted Anderson he hadn't been on with us in about a week and what's been
[1:55:07.040 --> 1:55:10.440]  happening is you look at a 12-year graph goals going straight up it's gone from
[1:55:10.440 --> 1:55:19.020]  260 bucks or less 254 I guess was the low now up to 1920 something back down to
[1:55:19.020 --> 1:55:25.260]  1850 now back up to almost 1900 and they put these articles out going look
[1:55:25.260 --> 1:55:29.220]  gold's going down but then a week later it retraces and goes past the last
[1:55:29.220 --> 1:55:33.180]  highs but I was even listening to Bloomberg propaganda this morning and
[1:55:33.180 --> 1:55:36.900]  they were had a big conference on inflation of all the top economists and
[1:55:36.900 --> 1:55:41.620]  globalist and they were talking about $5,000 gold in a year and the next
[1:55:41.620 --> 1:55:47.260]  analyst goes I don't agree only 3,000 so the the low end and driving in this
[1:55:47.260 --> 1:55:52.340]  morning and for 45 minutes they were saying 3,000 now I'm not gonna go there
[1:55:52.340 --> 1:55:56.380]  but I'll tell you if they're if they're gonna devalue the currency that much this
[1:55:56.380 --> 1:56:00.020]  is bad news but you might as well just go ahead and get into golden silver now
[1:56:00.020 --> 1:56:05.660]  listen you you feel stupid you didn't buy gold but it was 300 or 600 or 900 or
[1:56:05.660 --> 1:56:14.340]  1200 or 1500 or 1800 or now 1900 don't feel stupid get in now it is my view my
[1:56:14.340 --> 1:56:18.460]  belief I'll promote what I believe in I've been proven super accurate because
[1:56:18.460 --> 1:56:23.660]  I follow common sense it's not hard to know the truth folks it's all very simple
[1:56:23.660 --> 1:56:29.740]  TSA sticking their hands down your pants is tyranny government torturing is
[1:56:29.740 --> 1:56:34.820]  very scary life in prison for videotape and cops that's tyranny they start
[1:56:34.820 --> 1:56:41.420]  devaluing money gold's gonna go up I mean this is not rocket science so they're
[1:56:41.420 --> 1:56:45.380]  saying 3,000 the low side the next year 2500 by the end of the year that's what
[1:56:45.380 --> 1:56:49.540]  JP Morgan's been saying for a month whatever the point is is that I don't
[1:56:49.540 --> 1:56:55.380]  buy gold because I want it as an investment I've got golden silver I've
[1:56:55.380 --> 1:57:00.620]  been buying for really 14 years because it's an emergency backup for this
[1:57:00.620 --> 1:57:06.180]  operation and for my own personal life and it's been in good stead and look at
[1:57:06.180 --> 1:57:09.540]  all the other advice I give I told you food prices and oil prices would go up
[1:57:09.540 --> 1:57:14.140]  ladies and gentlemen this is literally two plus two equals four it's two plus
[1:57:14.140 --> 1:57:18.100]  two equals four says buy golden silver and if you're gonna buy it buy it at the
[1:57:18.100 --> 1:57:22.220]  lowest prices available from a guy that buys when it dips and sells it at the
[1:57:22.220 --> 1:57:27.140]  dip price when it's up to you very competitive Ted Anderson he has a few
[1:57:27.140 --> 1:57:30.740]  lost leaders when you call that a radio specials where he actually loses money or
[1:57:30.740 --> 1:57:33.740]  breaks even depending on the special chat I'm gonna hold you to the next segment
[1:57:33.740 --> 1:57:38.340]  then go to calls but tell them the specials real fast and the number yeah
[1:57:38.340 --> 1:57:42.020]  well I mean obviously the best special we have is eighty eight dollars you get
[1:57:42.020 --> 1:57:46.780]  the you get the the book the American dream video two silver dollars I mean
[1:57:46.780 --> 1:57:52.060]  you can't buy two silver dollars for that now 42 77 on the high today so
[1:57:52.060 --> 1:57:58.580]  that's just an absolute steal eighty eight dollars silver at cost or below the
[1:57:58.580 --> 1:58:03.020]  shipping and the two free gifts because I guess in the 88 you've had in the
[1:58:03.020 --> 1:58:07.220]  shipping so the cost of two silver dollars is 88 or more right now free
[1:58:07.220 --> 1:58:11.020]  shipping free video exposing the bankers and a free book on the big brother
[1:58:11.020 --> 1:58:18.300]  takeover 800 686 2237 800 686 237 now now what's the limit on those
[1:58:18.300 --> 1:58:21.460]  Ted's I know you've been limiting some of these specials I do I mean I've got a
[1:58:21.460 --> 1:58:24.980]  few of them out there right now I'll give one per household that you know per
[1:58:24.980 --> 1:58:29.380]  member so if you have five people there we'll let them have five all right 800
[1:58:29.380 --> 1:58:34.700]  686 237 but look folks that's a great deal in fact it's an insane deal but the
[1:58:34.700 --> 1:58:38.980]  other deals ask about the radio specials on other golden silver coins we'll be
[1:58:38.980 --> 1:58:54.940]  right back you have heard Alex explain how the silver lungs generator infuses
[1:58:54.940 --> 1:58:59.060]  the respiratory system with yourself produced colloidal silver solutions yet
[1:58:59.060 --> 1:59:02.460]  many are unaware of the entire function of the silver lung system and how it has
[1:59:02.460 --> 1:59:07.300]  been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body my
[1:59:07.300 --> 1:59:10.860]  name is Mario Sephalde and I'm the developer of the silver lungs generator

[1:59:18.980 --> 1:59:23.860]  devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas
[1:59:23.860 --> 1:59:31.020]  this includes the eyes ears nose lungs topically to the skin and orally for the

[2:00:13.740 --> 2:00:23.740]  Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin, Texas Alex Jones
[2:00:37.260 --> 2:00:42.460]  we are live into hour number three this will be a jam-packed hour it has to be
[2:00:42.460 --> 2:00:47.260]  I have to get to all the debate issues and about 30 other key stories at least
[2:00:47.260 --> 2:00:53.260]  we've got this amazing news and info wars.com and prison planet.com the NBC
[2:00:53.260 --> 2:00:58.340]  has been caught when Ron Paul won more than half the votes with the poll
[2:00:58.340 --> 2:01:04.900]  closing Ron Paul had 53% versus all the other candidates and they did this
[2:01:04.900 --> 2:01:10.260]  thing with the graph that you know here's Romney with way less than half of
[2:01:10.260 --> 2:01:13.500]  what he had and here's Ron Paul just barely above him and everybody complained
[2:01:13.500 --> 2:01:17.140]  about it so suddenly Ron Paul's like up here and here's everybody else we've
[2:01:17.140 --> 2:01:24.820]  got all those screenshots oh man and they just do it Fox CNN they all do it to
[2:01:24.820 --> 2:01:30.100]  to Ron Paul Fox dubbing and booing when he wins the straw poll and at CPAC I
[2:01:30.100 --> 2:01:36.140]  mean they have to these are desperate criminals they represent the bankers
[2:01:36.140 --> 2:01:39.700]  that have engaged in all this crime and they've got to take over completely are
[2:01:39.700 --> 2:01:43.820]  they're all going to prison most these media channels get your tax money that's
[2:01:43.820 --> 2:01:48.820]  come out of course they're a pack of lying scum
[2:01:52.140 --> 2:01:55.260]  going back to Ted Anderson Ted I want to talk about the goal briefly but as a
[2:01:55.260 --> 2:01:58.700]  huge Ron Paul supporter I know you've donated I don't know half million bucks
[2:01:58.700 --> 2:02:03.060]  the last four years or so one way or the other to the to the Ron Paul Air Force
[2:02:03.060 --> 2:02:08.460]  and blamps and everything else I know that's where most your profit goes that's
[2:02:08.460 --> 2:02:12.660]  why I teamed up with Ted 14 years ago because he's a he's a you know Ron Paul
[2:02:12.660 --> 2:02:18.540]  libertarian died in the wool not quite as extreme as I am because he's too busy
[2:02:18.540 --> 2:02:23.420]  working hard to do all the research I'm teasing Ted now the point is Ted what
[2:02:23.420 --> 2:02:26.660]  do you think I'm doing this to Ron Paul I mean it's just incredible he wins and
[2:02:26.660 --> 2:02:30.220]  then they don't even mention him on NBC and the articles about it I know it's
[2:02:30.220 --> 2:02:33.820]  it's really funny that when it happens like that I mean yeah it's almost
[2:02:33.820 --> 2:02:39.980]  comical now I mean they just can't give this guy the the the the do that is that
[2:02:39.980 --> 2:02:43.980]  it that's due to it's like putting somebody in an NFL football game and not
[2:02:43.980 --> 2:02:48.300]  letting them wear pads and so they still win the game and they go well the other
[2:02:48.300 --> 2:02:51.980]  team won even though the team without pads one I mean they it's like putting
[2:02:51.980 --> 2:02:55.940]  you in a gladiator arena without weapons and you win and they still give it to
[2:02:55.940 --> 2:02:59.860]  the dead guy yeah I know I know it's just amazing but you know what well we'll
[2:02:59.860 --> 2:03:04.420]  see when it comes down to the vote here at the very end but yeah it's you know
[2:03:04.420 --> 2:03:08.300]  that what they're just pushing for they they want you the guy that's down you
[2:03:08.300 --> 2:03:14.140]  know the the Texas governor and then Romney I mean anybody but Ron Paul I
[2:03:14.140 --> 2:03:19.700]  mean get anybody but Ron Paul I mean Perry literally looks like a some type
[2:03:19.700 --> 2:03:24.820]  of cartoon character with his collar all the way up to his neck and he turns
[2:03:24.820 --> 2:03:29.100]  his head turns with his body like a like a robot or something and all he's
[2:03:29.100 --> 2:03:34.900]  thinking about is well how much he loves Al Gore I tell you they're really scared
[2:03:34.900 --> 2:03:37.980]  around Paul we got to pray for him right now now Ted bravely as I'm going to
[2:03:37.980 --> 2:03:41.980]  break we appreciate you holding to be with us give folks a rundown of some of
[2:03:41.980 --> 2:03:45.860]  the other radio specials when they call they get the absolute fire sale deals
[2:03:45.860 --> 2:03:50.300]  already very competitive prices but when they call and say it's the Alex Jones
[2:03:50.300 --> 2:03:54.300]  radio special they get the lowest prices out there and I gotta say your prices
[2:03:54.300 --> 2:03:57.020]  nobody I've seen can match them you're asking me about well how many of those
[2:03:57.020 --> 2:04:01.140]  88 dollar deals they can get one per person but guess what you can then turn
[2:04:01.140 --> 2:04:06.300]  and get the fall of the Republic and end game and the Obama deception for 130
[2:04:06.300 --> 2:04:10.540]  when you're done buying that you can get the creature from Jekyll Island at 41
[2:04:10.540 --> 2:04:14.300]  dollars each one of those the the the fall of the Republic and that has three
[2:04:14.300 --> 2:04:17.100]  silver dollars and by the time they're done they're getting six silver dollars
[2:04:17.100 --> 2:04:20.660]  for about half the price and then of course if you want you can pick up the
[2:04:20.660 --> 2:04:25.060]  frank for 404 and get a full year subscription to Bob's Chapman's
[2:04:25.060 --> 2:04:29.140]  newsletter which is like buying gold at $1,000 and those are all the lost
[2:04:29.140 --> 2:04:32.620]  leaders get three silver dollars that cost get three of my films free with
[2:04:32.620 --> 2:04:36.580]  free shipping get two silver dollars free shipping all the other stuff this is
[2:04:36.580 --> 2:04:39.820]  what it comes out to but but you got a bunch of other radio specials that are
[2:04:39.820 --> 2:04:45.980]  just regular Frank gold coins sovereigns maple leaves buffaloes American
[2:04:45.980 --> 2:04:50.380]  Eagles there's a whole list of radio specials Ted yeah you name it I mean

[2:10:35.380 --> 2:10:40.940]  sir hey I just wanted to direct your attention to a breaking story a judge
[2:10:40.940 --> 2:10:46.580]  picked it up apparently last night during the debate during a commercial
[2:10:46.580 --> 2:10:54.340]  break Rick Perry went up to Ron Paul and grabbed his wrist and was pointing his
[2:10:54.340 --> 2:10:58.980]  finger at him and just like menacing him there's five pictures out right now
[2:10:58.980 --> 2:11:06.660]  three of them are on the drudges mark page right now yeah there it is no that's
[2:11:06.660 --> 2:11:10.580]  what Perry did to me but then was real smart mouth and said I don't have a
[2:11:10.580 --> 2:11:14.940]  bless I can't remember it was I want to say Thanksgiving or was it Christmas
[2:11:14.940 --> 2:11:19.140]  or like a week and he came over and just gave me the menacing look and there it
[2:11:19.140 --> 2:11:21.820]  is blow that up
[2:11:23.500 --> 2:11:29.540]  reportedly got up in his face Perry gets aggressive and he is really scared
[2:11:29.540 --> 2:11:34.580]  look look look Rick Perry told a major Fox News personality I'll leave it at
[2:11:34.580 --> 2:11:38.500]  that that he's scared of Ron Paul and Alex Jones almost a year and a half ago
[2:11:38.500 --> 2:11:44.260]  and I reported that at the time because he knows we know about his carbon taxes
[2:11:44.260 --> 2:11:49.420]  Bilderberg his toll roads his four shots his Al Gore loving I didn't know about
[2:11:49.420 --> 2:11:53.620]  the Hillary care loving I mean I'm sure there's more and I've talked to Ron
[2:11:53.620 --> 2:11:57.740]  Paul campaign talked to Ron Paul I said get get on him he's the front runner
[2:11:57.740 --> 2:12:02.540]  you're number two you they're gonna you've got to bring him down and Perry
[2:12:02.540 --> 2:12:07.700]  knows it and we've got to get Ron Paul to put a statement out Ron Paul is such
[2:12:07.700 --> 2:12:18.900]  a gentleman but it's almost surreal and now reading about this reportedly Perry
[2:12:18.900 --> 2:12:22.980]  got his face at first but then it didn't work then he tried to act nice but
[2:12:22.980 --> 2:12:28.340]  I mean Paul is not a wimp he's one of those little quiet guys and Perry is
[2:12:28.340 --> 2:12:32.100]  just an absolute piece of garbage I mean I told you he's like Captain Morgan you
[2:12:32.100 --> 2:12:35.900]  know crazed I mean imagine the governor walks over puts his hands on the you
[2:12:35.900 --> 2:12:40.540]  know on the chair in front of me and looks at me like he absolutely just
[2:12:40.540 --> 2:12:46.580]  wild-eyed you know wants to kill me and well like a pirate I mean he looks like
[2:12:46.580 --> 2:12:50.700]  a pirate up close and he goes I want you to have a blast whatever it was and
[2:12:50.700 --> 2:12:58.420]  just give him a smile and I was just like and I looked over and his family was
[2:12:58.420 --> 2:13:01.260]  all right there looking over his daughters were a lot younger than their
[2:13:01.260 --> 2:13:05.500]  their mid-twenties now I guess they must have been almost 20 then Sydney or
[2:13:05.500 --> 2:13:08.700]  whatever his name is I don't know there's a bunch of bunch of kids and I just
[2:13:08.700 --> 2:13:12.140]  looked at him and I was like what is this I didn't I didn't do anything and I
[2:13:12.140 --> 2:13:15.380]  probably should have and I was in a restaurant with Carl Rove a few months
[2:13:15.380 --> 2:13:20.540]  ago I guess the Super Bowl was going on Super Bowl Sunday finished the show took
[2:13:20.540 --> 2:13:24.340]  the guys to a steakhouse and we just got up and left and I said that guy's a war
[2:13:24.340 --> 2:13:28.300]  criminal I'm not eating dinner you know and place with Hitler and Rove was
[2:13:28.300 --> 2:13:31.460]  laughing about it and I was gonna wait and finish my food cuz he was already
[2:13:31.460 --> 2:13:35.380]  seated they sent me down it's like right beside me right behind me's Carl Rove and
[2:13:35.380 --> 2:13:38.380]  I was like okay I'm gonna get my food I'm gonna eat it but then they were kind
[2:13:38.380 --> 2:13:42.620]  of slow with the service and he was snickering and snorting and acting I
[2:13:42.620 --> 2:13:46.900]  mean literally I was like talking to the crew I was like is this actually going
[2:13:46.900 --> 2:13:55.260]  on and then my iPhone had been left at home and the other guys were I don't
[2:13:55.260 --> 2:14:00.540]  know acting well whatever the point is is that all of this goes on and it's just
[2:14:00.540 --> 2:14:09.100]  hard to believe wow this is breaking news here it is Perry debate and up in his
[2:14:09.100 --> 2:14:16.100]  face Perry gets aggressive and this is the Washington Times and reportedly as
[2:14:16.100 --> 2:14:20.700]  you said tell us what's in these articles as I read them sir
[2:14:21.540 --> 2:14:27.260]  caller caller you've read the articles give us your view on this well I mean
[2:14:27.260 --> 2:14:31.420]  neither one of the campaigns has come out you know with an explanation of what
[2:14:31.420 --> 2:14:35.660]  happened but I've seen all five of the pictures and he just looks to me like
[2:14:35.660 --> 2:14:39.540]  Rick Perry got upset you know when when Ron Paul called him out on the
[2:14:39.540 --> 2:14:45.580]  Gardasil thing and I mean the guy's just a thug and he doesn't know you know he
[2:14:45.580 --> 2:14:51.180]  can't act like a mature adult he has to threaten people that's what it looks like
[2:14:51.180 --> 2:14:55.580]  yeah this says according to Washington Times other papers he grabbed his wrist
[2:14:55.580 --> 2:15:01.700]  and wagged his finger at him very aggressive yeah that's the word reportedly
[2:15:01.700 --> 2:15:07.460]  that's what Perry got he read about it LBJ did that they grab you real hard and
[2:15:07.460 --> 2:15:11.540]  see he was hoping Paul punching because Paul is known actually if you if you
[2:15:11.540 --> 2:15:16.460]  sort grab it on him he will shove you away like you saw with Sasha Baron Cohen
[2:15:16.460 --> 2:15:21.140]  the physical exchange what's now it now it's an exchange like Paul was involved
[2:15:21.140 --> 2:15:25.220]  was matched by the intensity of the two men's verbal attacks on each other the
[2:15:25.220 --> 2:15:31.460]  first shot was invited by the debate moderators who asked Mr. Paul to expand
[2:15:31.460 --> 2:15:35.820]  on his accusations guys I think I have that in the clips but just go to YouTube
[2:15:35.820 --> 2:15:40.140]  and pull it up Paul brings up Gardasil to Perry or something like that will get
[2:15:40.140 --> 2:15:44.780]  it made in recent days that Mr. Perry who has spent more than a decade as
[2:15:44.780 --> 2:15:48.780]  governor of Texas is less conservative and voters think here's the quote from
[2:15:48.780 --> 2:15:53.420]  Paul just take HPV Mr. Paul said referring to Mr. Perry's scrap plan to
[2:15:53.420 --> 2:15:56.900]  require girls in the state to be given a vaccine against the sexually
[2:15:56.900 --> 2:16:00.540]  transmitted virus forcing 12-year-old girls to take an inoculation to prevent
[2:16:00.540 --> 2:16:04.580]  a sexually transmitted disease this is not good medicine I do not believe I
[2:16:04.580 --> 2:16:10.820]  think it's a social misfit he also said that the TSA are sexually molesting
[2:16:10.820 --> 2:16:16.420]  people Mr. Perry acknowledged he's gone about the plan the wrong way when he
[2:16:16.420 --> 2:16:19.860]  refused to bypass the legislature and when he tried to bypass the
[2:16:19.860 --> 2:16:24.780]  legislature but said he's been trying to combat the cancer and it goes on I
[2:16:24.780 --> 2:16:29.020]  think we have that clip let's go ahead and play that now here it is I just take
[2:16:29.020 --> 2:16:37.380]  the HPV forcing 12-year-old girls to take an inoculation to prevent this
[2:16:37.380 --> 2:16:42.180]  sexually transmitted disease this is not good medicine I do not believe I
[2:16:42.180 --> 2:16:48.300]  think it's social social misfit and not say it's not good social policy and
[2:16:48.300 --> 2:16:55.300]  therefore I think this is very bad to do this but the one of the worst parts
[2:16:55.300 --> 2:16:59.740]  about that was the way it was done you know the governorship in Texas
[2:16:59.740 --> 2:17:02.180]  traditionally supposed to be a weak governorship I didn't even know they
[2:17:02.180 --> 2:17:07.020]  could pass laws by writing an executive order he did it with an executive order
[2:17:07.020 --> 2:17:13.740]  passed it the state was furious and this the legislature overwhelmingly
[2:17:13.740 --> 2:17:18.420]  probably 90% I don't know exactly overwhelming we repealed this but I
[2:17:18.420 --> 2:17:22.740]  think it's the way it was passed which was so bad I think it's a bad piece of
[2:17:22.740 --> 2:17:28.140]  legislation but I don't like the idea of executive orders I as president will
[2:17:28.140 --> 2:17:31.860]  not use the executive order to write law
[2:17:31.860 --> 2:17:34.900]  Perry will get to you but Congresswoman Bachman this is an issue you've also
[2:17:34.900 --> 2:17:41.260]  talked about HPV okay I think it is great news that Perry and it's now
[2:17:41.260 --> 2:17:45.420]  confirmed by several papers grabbed him and was forceful it appeared and got in
[2:17:45.420 --> 2:17:51.100]  his face and they're now trying to get exactly what he said but that he got in
[2:17:51.100 --> 2:17:55.380]  his face was telling me you know watch it that's great because Ron Paul nice
[2:17:55.380 --> 2:18:00.380]  guys are actually the most aggressive anybody who's lived long enough knows
[2:18:00.380 --> 2:18:03.820]  that the guys that are real friendly real gentlemanly that's who you don't want
[2:18:03.820 --> 2:18:08.780]  to mess with because they learn to control themselves and I've seen
[2:18:08.780 --> 2:18:13.660]  Paul the only times he really shines is when he's attacked then he's not the
[2:18:13.660 --> 2:18:17.380]  nice little doctor being all calculating then he'll actually explode on
[2:18:17.380 --> 2:18:21.940]  people this is great he is now gonna really go after Perry call her final
[2:18:21.940 --> 2:18:27.620]  comments on this just one more thing Fox News picked up the story to the
[2:18:27.620 --> 2:18:32.820]  articles called Perry confronts Ron Paul during commercial and they show the
[2:18:32.820 --> 2:18:36.420]  picture of Perry wagging his finger and Ron Paul space to be interesting thing
[2:18:36.420 --> 2:18:41.140]  is they cut off the bottom with the part where Rick is actually grabbing his
[2:18:41.140 --> 2:18:47.900]  wrist so that just shows you you know how in the tank Fox News is for Perry well
[2:18:47.900 --> 2:18:54.900]  Perry is a gangster and Ron Paul has got bodyguards and that's good but Perry's
[2:18:54.900 --> 2:18:58.700]  a gangster he goes to Bilderberg he's the one guy they could get to kill little
[2:18:58.700 --> 2:19:03.500]  girls with that shot that immediately did kill people and he's a hardcore
[2:19:03.500 --> 2:19:11.660]  gangster and he's crazed and he's very dangerous and I'm looking at the photo
[2:19:11.660 --> 2:19:17.540]  it's the second down on Rudge up at his face Perry gets aggressive and grabbed
[2:19:17.540 --> 2:19:21.300]  Paul's arm and squeezed it grabbed him on the wrist squeeze it and got in his
[2:19:21.300 --> 2:19:27.940]  face and Paul of course you know just looked at him like the mentally ill
[2:19:27.940 --> 2:19:34.260]  person he is I mean when you look at these two men one is not a man one is an
[2:19:34.260 --> 2:19:42.060]  ego-driven lazy slothful scumbag gal gore lover and the other is the only guy
[2:19:42.060 --> 2:19:45.500]  in the congressional baseball team to ever knock a home run out of the park
[2:19:45.500 --> 2:19:49.420]  he's a guy because I've talked to his brothers who used to beat up bullies two
[2:19:49.420 --> 2:19:52.660]  or three at a time see where nobody talks about that with Ron Paul I don't love
[2:19:52.660 --> 2:19:56.020]  to see Ron Paul like a doctor just karate chop Perry right in the throat
[2:19:56.020 --> 2:19:59.940]  all right we'll be right back it's a salt to grab somebody by the arm Perry

[2:24:13.780 --> 2:24:20.100]  photos and now there's video of it just incredible we've got it all up at info
[2:24:20.100 --> 2:24:26.500]  wars.com and prisonplanet.com let's go ahead and take another call here let's
[2:24:26.500 --> 2:24:33.580]  talk to Don in Oregon Don you're on the air yeah hey Alex I want to get your
[2:24:33.580 --> 2:24:38.980]  opinion about two points of history that I've been researching but it's really
[2:24:38.980 --> 2:24:45.340]  hard to come to any conclusions the first number one is the protocols of
[2:24:45.340 --> 2:24:50.300]  Zion I'm just wondering what you thought about that I mean nobody knows who
[2:24:50.300 --> 2:24:53.900]  wrote that they think the Zara secret police wrote it it's written like a
[2:24:53.900 --> 2:24:59.380]  comic book and they call it a forgery but a forgery would be a copy of
[2:24:59.380 --> 2:25:04.980]  something that isn't real so again I don't tend to get into things that can't
[2:25:04.980 --> 2:25:09.100]  be proven one way or another I think it's sold over the last hundred years
[2:25:09.100 --> 2:25:13.860]  something like you know hundreds of millions of copies I was in Walmart and
[2:25:13.860 --> 2:25:17.820]  looked down they had stacks of them being sold and it basically says there's a
[2:25:17.820 --> 2:25:23.060]  secret Zionist plot to take over the world but frankly every major group and
[2:25:23.060 --> 2:25:26.780]  organization wants to take over the world every major corporation states
[2:25:26.780 --> 2:25:30.620]  their plan is global domination the Chinese want to take over the world the
[2:25:30.620 --> 2:25:34.100]  Anglo-American establishment the Israeli interests want to dominate and
[2:25:34.100 --> 2:25:39.020]  take over so there is a lot of that going on but I tend to go off of what's
[2:25:39.020 --> 2:25:44.900]  happening and what I can prove not documents like that well it's really
[2:25:44.900 --> 2:25:52.020]  interesting that almost every method and goal of the New World order that you
[2:25:52.020 --> 2:25:57.820]  know we talk about on this show is in there almost you know word for word it
[2:25:57.820 --> 2:26:02.820]  I think everything is in there except for the eugenics agenda and gun control I
[2:26:02.820 --> 2:26:08.460]  mean every other thing that's going on now it's in there that's what I don't
[2:26:08.460 --> 2:26:14.460]  know but the second thing is the Holocaust specifically with respect to
[2:26:14.460 --> 2:26:21.900]  the gas chambers and the zycon be no no I know listen I know all that gets
[2:26:21.900 --> 2:26:27.740]  debated all day the Nazis themselves shot because we've done a lot of research
[2:26:27.740 --> 2:26:31.740]  here on World War two and we've got the National Archives footage that you came
[2:26:31.740 --> 2:26:34.780]  from Germany they had minutes theirs where you know they heard the people
[2:26:34.780 --> 2:26:38.940]  into the pits women children men and shoot them are you saying that isn't
[2:26:38.940 --> 2:26:44.380]  real either no I'm not saying anything I'm just asking about the the gas
[2:26:44.380 --> 2:26:49.740]  chambers and the zycon be do you think that that's real or not because I can't
[2:26:49.740 --> 2:26:53.620]  come to any conclusion I know here in the United States we execute people with
[2:26:53.620 --> 2:26:57.700]  gas but some say that didn't exist either gas chambers don't exist I guess in
[2:26:57.700 --> 2:27:01.100]  Germany or here in the US I thought it was part of the death penalty and things
[2:27:01.100 --> 2:27:07.940]  you know I I again I actually have an allergy to the obsession for Israel and
[2:27:07.940 --> 2:27:11.860]  against it you know I'm here talking about Rick Perry get in the face of Ron
[2:27:11.860 --> 2:27:14.620]  Paul and grabbing his arm and I just want to get rid of the fellow reserve
[2:27:14.620 --> 2:27:18.380]  whoever runs it it could be run by the Easter Bunny I want to get rid of it is
[2:27:18.380 --> 2:27:24.660]  their Jewish mafia absolutely did they set up the ADL whenever they got caught
[2:27:24.660 --> 2:27:28.380]  doing stuff to demonize anybody that went after Jewish mafia yes am I against
[2:27:28.380 --> 2:27:31.020]  the Jewish mafia yeah I'm against every other form of organized crime I

[2:27:40.780 --> 2:27:46.460]  continual cover-up of the big secret Alex I believe is that the Dr. Paul will

[2:27:50.460 --> 2:27:54.140]  want anybody to know because it'll win him well I mean I mean he did point out
[2:27:54.140 --> 2:27:57.660]  in the debate they tried to interrupt him that Mexico is totally collapsing
[2:27:57.660 --> 2:28:02.140]  because of the fake drug war and now the organized crimes taking over all the
[2:28:02.140 --> 2:28:05.460]  police departments every facet of society so we always have a failed
[2:28:05.460 --> 2:28:11.020]  society down there we have a group of organized criminals holding a hundred
[2:28:11.020 --> 2:28:16.460]  million people hostage who are completely ruthless and are ready to die and

[2:37:12.300 --> 2:37:16.500]  shove you through them because the what's this class to me back I'm ripping
[2:37:16.500 --> 2:37:21.700]  it off who because the magnetism generated by such technology can cause
[2:37:21.700 --> 2:37:27.060]  implants to move causing physical damage to the body the device helps perform a
[2:37:27.060 --> 2:37:32.260]  bodily function the scan can also cause it to malfunction so what this is
[2:37:32.260 --> 2:37:35.300]  particularly dangerous to anyone who has knee or hip replacement because the
[2:37:35.300 --> 2:37:40.700]  scan can damage and weaken surrounding tissues so what this can also cause the
[2:37:40.700 --> 2:37:44.580]  metal objects to heat up risking burns the heating process and also be fatal
[2:37:44.580 --> 2:37:48.420]  for babies or pregnant women well so what gotta find all kind of who the
[2:37:48.420 --> 2:37:52.340]  government funds publicly people with damaged kidneys would also be at risk
[2:37:52.340 --> 2:37:56.740]  due to some MRI scanning technology which can cause and it goes through the
[2:37:56.740 --> 2:38:02.620]  systematic fibrosis of the kidney and he just goes through a whole bunch of it
[2:38:02.620 --> 2:38:09.180]  where it came out that when they don't have them calibrated right the hair
[2:38:09.180 --> 2:38:14.900]  falls out within days but so what if it's good for the TSA agents to be dying
[2:38:14.900 --> 2:38:21.300]  in there everybody should start getting zapped continuing with some other
[2:38:21.300 --> 2:38:27.220]  important news home video of Gaddafi as Hunt intensifies and this is Sky
[2:38:27.220 --> 2:38:34.820]  Television Fox News of Europe I'm always hearing that they got him
[2:38:34.820 --> 2:38:40.020]  surrounded I heard that six months ago and then and then the war is going on
[2:38:40.020 --> 2:38:45.820]  the Civil War they're now reporting according to Newsday that the Al Qaeda
[2:38:45.820 --> 2:38:50.300]  government estimates at least 30,000 died in the war so they could never
[2:38:50.300 --> 2:38:53.820]  confirm that any of the protesters were killed but they had to go in there for
[2:38:53.820 --> 2:39:00.060]  humanitarian reasons and now it's a giant Civil War 30,000 dead it's also in the
[2:39:00.060 --> 2:39:05.220]  mail and Guardian online that it's admitted that blacks are being hunted
[2:39:05.220 --> 2:39:09.500]  down and systematically killed because I guess blacks aren't supposed to be in
[2:39:09.500 --> 2:39:13.660]  Africa well then where are they supposed to be then also Gaddafi's put out a new
[2:39:13.660 --> 2:39:19.740]  TV video saying scumbags germs and rats Gaddafi's bizarre TV ran as he insists
[2:39:19.740 --> 2:39:25.220]  he's still in Libya he claims his loyalist army is still going strong and

[2:40:35.460 --> 2:40:40.340]  other really important news I want to get to but I am not stunned but I was
[2:40:40.340 --> 2:40:44.820]  blindsided I mean I wasn't I knew Perry did stuff like this and I've said Ron
[2:40:44.820 --> 2:40:49.260]  Paul's got to watch out but then still when it actually happens it's I mean you
[2:40:49.260 --> 2:40:55.060]  look at the photos of this Perry just in his face grabbing his arm going boy and
[2:40:55.060 --> 2:40:58.660]  the God knows what they're gonna try to do to Paul I mean Perry is very dangerous
[2:40:58.660 --> 2:41:06.020]  and the people that run him are very he is mafia he is mafia he's globalist all
[2:41:06.020 --> 2:41:12.660]  the way and super bad news and he knows Paul is breathing down his neck and it's
[2:41:12.660 --> 2:41:17.500]  gonna beat him if Paul keeps going after him is Al Gore's cheerleader and as a
[2:41:17.500 --> 2:41:23.500]  carbon taxer and as a gun grabber and as a Hillary carer lover and as a forced
[2:41:23.500 --> 2:41:30.180]  inoculator it's over and then after he's destroyed him Paul can then turn to
[2:41:30.180 --> 2:41:34.500]  Mitt Romney who's almost as bad and it's hard to be almost as bad
[2:41:34.500 --> 2:41:46.340]  Obamacare author his model was used carbon tax lover just I mean the word
[2:41:46.340 --> 2:41:56.700]  gets out on this it's over so it is coffin nails as they say for the
[2:41:56.700 --> 2:42:01.740]  political careers of these men there's nothing they can dig up on Paul so
[2:42:01.740 --> 2:42:06.540]  they're gonna go the route they've already started this of the ran treatment

[2:42:26.300 --> 2:42:29.460]  Paul to run and then I'm sure he doesn't when people are gonna gripe and
[2:42:29.460 --> 2:42:34.100]  complain about I spent time I spent money he's risking his life ladies and
[2:42:34.100 --> 2:42:39.540]  gentlemen those of us that are in the arena and I'm in the arena not the level
[2:42:39.540 --> 2:42:47.860]  Ron Paul is I was only a few yards behind Ron Paul and reaching people you
[2:42:47.860 --> 2:42:52.100]  know a year ago or so now Ron Paul by being this prominent is light years
[2:42:52.100 --> 2:42:57.900]  ahead of me reaching people waking folks up I mean in the chain of events who's
[2:42:57.900 --> 2:43:01.740]  waking people up you can ask anybody on the street who's woken up they'll tell
[2:43:01.740 --> 2:43:06.180]  you Ron Paul and then Alex Jones and as Ron Paul said here three and a half
[2:43:06.180 --> 2:43:09.100]  years ago during the campaign out of the blue he said you know Alex about half
[2:43:09.100 --> 2:43:13.660]  my support has come from your audience about half the people on the trail and
[2:43:13.660 --> 2:43:16.740]  and people donating say they they learned about me from your show in the
[2:43:16.740 --> 2:43:21.900]  last you know decade or so I'm interviewing Ron Paul for 16 plus years
[2:43:21.900 --> 2:43:28.580]  right when I got on radio in 1996 I guess 16 years Ron Paul was on the show
[2:43:28.580 --> 2:43:32.260]  one of my first guest that was the first guy I wanted to get on he was a
[2:43:32.260 --> 2:43:37.340]  little-known congressman at the time and I'm very proud of the fact that the
[2:43:37.340 --> 2:43:44.300]  congressman gained some prominence as part of a launching pad he'll part of
[2:43:44.300 --> 2:43:47.820]  the concrete that went into his launching pad part of the gantry part of
[2:43:47.820 --> 2:43:56.620]  the liquid fuel system and you the audience are just amazing putting up
[2:43:56.620 --> 2:44:01.100]  with me and getting the word out and just everything and I've got to say I'm
[2:44:01.100 --> 2:44:07.380]  very excited the weeknight show is a big success it's growing faster than I
[2:44:07.380 --> 2:44:12.500]  thought it would and now I've just got to continue to basically swallow what
[2:44:12.500 --> 2:44:20.060]  I've bitten off here we're trying to it's so exciting we finished the show at
[2:44:20.060 --> 2:44:23.380]  like 8 o'clock and then we're up here planning the next show and researching
[2:44:23.380 --> 2:44:28.420]  and and our problem is we do too much and then it's like an hour and a half of
[2:44:28.420 --> 2:44:32.780]  just trying to get it all out there to you but we're honing it I've got to get
[2:44:32.780 --> 2:44:36.580]  it down to 30 minutes for television and again it's not going to be like you
[2:44:36.580 --> 2:44:39.980]  know Glenn Beck going right on CNN and Fox and that's not our what we're going
[2:44:39.980 --> 2:44:44.580]  to do we that'll never happen those systems will just decline and fade off
[2:44:44.580 --> 2:44:48.740]  into nothingness as they lose their viewers we've got little cable systems
[2:44:48.740 --> 2:44:52.660]  and international cable systems and major satellite systems that do have
[2:44:52.660 --> 2:44:56.540]  channels that we're gonna be able to get on I've already had again this show
[2:44:56.540 --> 2:44:59.540]  requested hey will you edit it down every day to an hour and I'm like I don't
[2:44:59.540 --> 2:45:04.500]  have the personnel and they're like and I don't even have a sales department for
[2:45:04.500 --> 2:45:09.620]  TV to where we could sell some ads to even be able to pay to produce it and
[2:45:09.620 --> 2:45:13.060]  then I had to build my own studio and I had to get the money for that and I had
[2:45:13.060 --> 2:45:16.540]  to hire the people and I had to get it all together and while I was doing all
[2:45:16.540 --> 2:45:20.660]  the other jobs I'm not complaining just that's why it's taking time and now we're
[2:45:20.660 --> 2:45:24.500]  right up to this point we've just got to hone some things and we couldn't have
[2:45:24.500 --> 2:45:27.780]  done any of this without you at prison planet dot TV and we've got some real
[2:45:27.780 --> 2:45:31.780]  treats for you tonight 7 p.m. Central I'll just leave it at that but we've got
[2:45:31.780 --> 2:45:36.180]  a lot of new members at prison planet dot TV and people are very happy and we're
[2:45:36.180 --> 2:45:42.260]  adding more features more systems we're taking your feedback and the sites just
[2:45:42.260 --> 2:45:45.740]  going to get better and better and it's going to segue into a whole new site in
[2:45:45.740 --> 2:45:50.540]  the near future and we're really working our tails off and the capital that comes
[2:45:50.540 --> 2:45:53.740]  in we're going to hire another programmer on top of everything else we're
[2:45:53.740 --> 2:45:57.980]  doing job interviews on that front so we can get even more out and the social
[2:45:57.980 --> 2:46:00.580]  network keeps getting postponed just because I had to get all this other
[2:46:00.580 --> 2:46:04.380]  stuff done but it's coming very soon and we're doing all this because of you at
[2:46:04.380 --> 2:46:08.620]  prison planet dot TV all right let me take a few more calls and I'll come back
[2:46:08.620 --> 2:46:13.740]  and I get into some of this other news I haven't hit yet right now let's go to
[2:46:13.740 --> 2:46:22.500]  JR in Texas JR you're on the air Alex yes sir I want to thank you for all your
[2:46:22.500 --> 2:46:28.140]  sacrifices that you and your crew make my question is real quick what would
[2:46:28.140 --> 2:46:33.500]  happen God willing that dr. Paul wins and becomes president and he hands more
[2:46:33.500 --> 2:46:37.740]  power over to the state wouldn't that put us in a worse position here in Texas
[2:46:37.740 --> 2:46:45.980]  with Ron Paul be or excuse me with Perry being our governor you know that is
[2:46:45.980 --> 2:46:51.740]  justice be done may the heavens fall that there's always weird permutations
[2:46:51.740 --> 2:46:57.060]  and sub calculations if somebody's a good person told the truth and is going
[2:46:57.060 --> 2:47:01.260]  to stand up for the Constitution and Bill of Rights that's what it's all
[2:47:01.260 --> 2:47:10.980]  about Ron Paul wouldn't hand more power to the states he would simply not grab
[2:47:10.980 --> 2:47:16.380]  power that the feds don't have and that's an issue for Texas to get rid of
[2:47:16.380 --> 2:47:21.700]  Perry politically so to say we better not elect Ron Paul because then because
[2:47:21.700 --> 2:47:27.020]  then Perry will be doing bad things in Texas how about elect Ron Paul and block
[2:47:27.020 --> 2:47:33.540]  Perry from becoming president I can flip that back over on you okay I
[2:47:33.540 --> 2:47:37.460]  understand where you're coming from I really hope dr. Paul wins and like I
[2:47:37.460 --> 2:47:41.780]  said again I appreciate you for all your work this is from dark star JR here in
[2:47:41.780 --> 2:47:47.500]  Austin Texas well thank you so much sir and again I wasn't criticizing you for
[2:47:47.500 --> 2:47:51.900]  making that point it's just you know I hear this I hear libertarians say don't
[2:47:51.900 --> 2:47:55.460]  get Ron Paul in because then as everything collapses they're gonna blame
[2:47:55.460 --> 2:48:01.860]  him I mean there's always this over calculating do what's right but the
[2:48:01.860 --> 2:48:07.220]  chips fall where they may this is a culture of lawyering and we're so run
[2:48:07.220 --> 2:48:12.380]  by lawyers and word smiths and spin doctors that we all kind of start
[2:48:12.380 --> 2:48:17.860]  adopting it yeah I had people in a decade ago or more than a decade ago say
[2:48:17.860 --> 2:48:22.060]  listen don't talk about government-sponsored care or leave the system
[2:48:22.060 --> 2:48:25.700]  alone don't talk about the New World Order and then get on a bunch of stations
[2:48:25.700 --> 2:48:28.580]  and then just kind of be a main line conservative that's better than Democrats
[2:48:28.580 --> 2:48:35.980]  and I'm like no it's not look I cannot sit here and manipulate what I say and
[2:48:35.980 --> 2:48:42.940]  do I mean it's exhausting enough telling the truth and then and not having to
[2:48:42.940 --> 2:48:48.460]  think about what I just said I can't imagine being a liar and and having to
[2:48:48.460 --> 2:48:58.220]  keep track of all the bull so I mean just look we got into this situation by by
[2:48:58.220 --> 2:49:03.100]  playing games and compromising and look forget the maneuvers go straight at
[2:49:03.100 --> 2:49:08.260]  them let's go ahead and go to Jeremy in California you're on the air go ahead
[2:49:08.260 --> 2:49:14.660]  hey man I just I wanted to call because I somewhat disagree with well I do
[2:49:14.660 --> 2:49:20.580]  disagree with last night I think that Ron Paul's performance was lackluster
[2:49:20.580 --> 2:49:25.380]  and I think that the polling results you know no matter what happens Ron Paul's
[2:49:25.380 --> 2:49:29.860]  people are always going to show up at the polls and vote that he won and I
[2:49:29.860 --> 2:49:32.900]  think that what we have to be honest about is that he had some golden
[2:49:32.900 --> 2:49:36.660]  opportunities last night particularly when Perry did grab his arm and all that
[2:49:36.660 --> 2:49:40.780]  you know Ron Paul's envelope of time is closing because the establishment is
[2:49:40.780 --> 2:49:45.020]  closing in on him and he could have brought it up in the debate when they
[2:49:45.020 --> 2:49:50.140]  came back on the air and he could have said like when you grab my arm during
[2:49:50.140 --> 2:49:55.500]  the commercial he's smart he knows they would have spun that that Ron Paul's
[2:49:55.500 --> 2:50:01.260]  being a sissy Ron Paul's complaining Ron Paul knows he's wise to sit back for a
[2:50:01.260 --> 2:50:07.540]  minute if you have time and then let things develop Ron Paul's very wise but
[2:50:07.540 --> 2:50:11.300]  listen have you ever and you may have been but have you ever have you ever been
[2:50:11.300 --> 2:50:14.860]  out and with bright lights in your face with five six other people and you're
[2:50:14.860 --> 2:50:21.220]  being interrupted constantly and you're 76 years old and work 18 hours a day
[2:50:21.220 --> 2:50:25.060]  listen Alex I'm not gonna I'm not gonna debate with you if Ron Paul works his
[2:50:25.060 --> 2:50:29.340]  butt off because I know that he does but what I'm talking about is that he had
[2:50:29.340 --> 2:50:33.380]  he had that the spotlight was on him last night hey hey he didn't want to run
[2:50:33.380 --> 2:50:37.300]  he's been wanting to retire for a long time privately people demand he didn't
[2:50:37.300 --> 2:50:42.380]  retire okay we got an old champion he didn't perfect man that's who we threw
[2:50:42.380 --> 2:50:48.340]  in the the tiger cage okay and so I'm just not gonna sit there and second
[2:50:48.340 --> 2:50:52.420]  guess somebody when they're in the arena okay I mean it and I see what you're
[2:50:52.420 --> 2:50:58.100]  saying and he's getting on the attack with the ads okay he's an old man all
[2:50:58.100 --> 2:51:03.540]  right we'll be right back you've been lied to lied to by the Wall Street

[2:54:09.780 --> 2:54:15.980]  people attacking him the questioners being interrupted Rick Perry grabbing his
[2:54:15.980 --> 2:54:23.020]  arm during the debate I mean he won the last debate all the pundits had to
[2:54:23.020 --> 2:54:28.540]  admit he won this debate and then people say oh well you know his people are
[2:54:28.540 --> 2:54:35.140]  gonna vote on all the polls he won the straw poll in in New Hampshire he's
[2:54:35.140 --> 2:54:39.580]  coming first second or third in scientific polls this isn't three and a
[2:54:39.580 --> 2:54:43.460]  half years ago where they could spin him winning the internet polls he won the
[2:54:43.460 --> 2:54:51.140]  NBC poll that by the way was Geo located you can only vote once I checked it he
[2:54:51.140 --> 2:55:00.020]  got more than all the other candidates combined and NBC didn't even talk about
[2:55:00.020 --> 2:55:04.100]  him in their article we have an article up at info wars.com about that right
[2:55:04.100 --> 2:55:10.260]  now look I got loaded phones and I've got this whole piece I did I thought was
[2:55:10.260 --> 2:55:14.500]  really powerful last night on info wars not only news with Sheriff Richard
[2:55:14.500 --> 2:55:18.780]  Mack now was gonna air that but we'll probably just end up playing it tomorrow
[2:55:18.780 --> 2:55:25.740]  but again we've got the headline MSNBC ignores winner of debate Ron Paul and
[2:55:25.740 --> 2:55:32.700]  then we've got the other headline up at info wars.com pictures show Perry
[2:55:32.700 --> 2:55:37.920]  physically intimidating Ron Paul border control drug cartel demand 30,000
[2:55:37.920 --> 2:55:42.460]  let football team cross I mean this is the breakdown of society but like I
[2:55:42.460 --> 2:55:46.860]  said I'll be on tonight 7 o'clock Central Prison Planet TV let's let's play a
[2:55:46.860 --> 2:55:50.740]  clip of Ron Paul on the border fence situation he talks about the drug war
[2:55:50.740 --> 2:55:55.740]  really being the main problem and how the fence will be used to keep us in not
[2:55:55.740 --> 2:55:59.100]  other people out that's already happening on the Canadian border it's all
[2:55:59.100 --> 2:56:03.900]  about keeping Americans in here it is obviously it's a very big problem I think
[2:56:03.900 --> 2:56:07.460]  we need to remove the incentive easy road to citizenship nobody has mentioned
[2:56:07.460 --> 2:56:13.260]  the fact that they qualify for benefits as well you know the welfare of
[2:56:13.260 --> 2:56:15.980]  benefits that we shouldn't have to give the state of Texas shouldn't be forced
[2:56:15.980 --> 2:56:20.740]  to provide free healthcare and free free education but there there is a mess
[2:56:20.740 --> 2:56:25.580]  down there is a big mess and it's the drug war that's going on there and our
[2:56:25.580 --> 2:56:29.620]  drug laws are driving this so now we're killing thousands and thousand people
[2:56:29.620 --> 2:56:34.500]  that makes it much more complicated but people who want big fences and guns
[2:56:34.500 --> 2:56:38.260]  sure we could secure the borders a bar bar fence with machine guns that would
[2:56:38.260 --> 2:56:42.860]  do the trick I don't believe that's what America is all about I just really don't
[2:56:42.860 --> 2:56:46.140]  we can enforce our law if we had a healthy economy this wouldn't be such a
[2:56:46.140 --> 2:56:50.100]  bad deal people are worrying about jobs but every time you think about this
[2:56:50.100 --> 2:56:55.500]  toughness on the border and ID cards and real ideas think that it's a it's a
[2:56:55.500 --> 2:57:00.380]  penalty against the American people too I think this fence business is designed
[2:57:00.380 --> 2:57:04.460]  and may well be used against us and keep us in an economic turmoil the people
[2:57:04.460 --> 2:57:07.700]  want to leave with their capital and there's capital controls and there's
[2:57:07.700 --> 2:57:11.140]  people control so every time you think of a fence keeping all those bad people
[2:57:11.140 --> 2:57:16.060]  out think about those fences maybe being used against us keeping us in yeah
[2:57:16.060 --> 2:57:20.700]  the way to tackle it is the magnet you get caught illegally working in Mexico
[2:57:20.700 --> 2:57:25.540]  you get six months to a year hard labor anytime Mexico lectures us go hey you're
[2:57:25.540 --> 2:57:30.260]  totally collapsing you sneak into Mexico out of Latin America you get hard
[2:57:30.260 --> 2:57:35.140]  labor shut up we can't pay for the babies we can't pay for the welfare
[2:57:35.140 --> 2:57:39.740]  we're bankrupt we're losing our jobs go down there and have a revolution get
[2:57:39.740 --> 2:57:43.940]  your country back they're using America as a steam valve because they would have
[2:57:43.940 --> 2:57:48.740]  already had a revolution down there I want Mexico to do good I want its people
[2:57:48.740 --> 2:57:53.940]  to have freedom I'd love 1776 in Mexico if you could instill liberty down there
[2:57:53.940 --> 2:57:57.860]  and get rid of the culture of corruption it would be a paradise instead it's a
[2:57:57.860 --> 2:58:02.780]  nightmare it is a nightmare down there where the strong men dominate the weak
[2:58:02.780 --> 2:58:07.340]  or the people where the weak don't get together in mutual defense against
[2:58:07.340 --> 2:58:13.780]  tyranny we better rediscover the spirit of liberty go after monopolies go after
[2:58:13.780 --> 2:58:18.100]  the strong men that try to dominate the strong men that aren't tyrants need to
[2:58:18.100 --> 2:58:21.460]  stand up for the week instead of thinking your winners and joining the
[2:58:21.460 --> 2:58:26.060]  dark side because in the end you destroy the entire society and that's the big
[2:58:26.060 --> 2:58:31.260]  secret a lot of you that serve evil who aren't completely wicked you can't make
[2:58:31.260 --> 2:58:34.860]  a deal with evil you can't make a deal with cancer and I think a lot of you
[2:58:34.860 --> 2:58:59.220]  are starting to get that see you tonight 7 o'clock central info wars.com
