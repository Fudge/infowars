[00:00.000 --> 00:08.720]  cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08.720 --> 00:19.080]  And now live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones. Oil continues to explode in prices despite
[00:19.080 --> 00:26.600]  Saudi output increase pledge because it isn't supply. It isn't supply. If you read the
[00:26.600 --> 00:33.440]  actual OPEC reports, it is dollar devaluation and speculation in commodities because the
[00:33.440 --> 00:41.000]  global currency is dying to make way for the New World Order. Unbelievable oil rises despite
[00:41.000 --> 00:48.100]  Saudi output pledge. The Supreme Court is set to announce in the next few hours a vicious
[00:48.100 --> 00:52.040]  attack on the Second Amendment. It will be announced as a victory for the Second Amendment,
[00:52.040 --> 00:56.840]  but we'll say they can restrict it by law. We've got Larry Prett and Aaron Zellman coming
[00:56.840 --> 00:59.760]  on tomorrow to analyze this. We're waiting for that ruling, but we already know what
[00:59.760 --> 01:04.880]  it's going to be. And so that's coming up. We're about to have Jordan Maxwell on in the
[01:04.880 --> 01:12.600]  next segment. Right now, going back to Ted Anderson, Ted, this just now came out in
[01:12.600 --> 01:19.000]  Associated Press. Right now up on infoawards.com. It's also up on Drudge and Yahoo News. Oil
[01:19.000 --> 01:26.120]  rises on modest Saudi increase, Nigeria. Oil prices have risen. I mean, a disappointment
[01:26.120 --> 01:30.680]  with Saudi's output hike and it goes on and they give you the dissent for saying it's
[01:30.680 --> 01:39.160]  Nigerian pipeline problems. It's dollar. I watched yesterday the Saudi oil emergency
[01:39.160 --> 01:42.840]  meeting and they kept saying it's currency. It's currency, but you'll never get on our
[01:42.840 --> 01:47.440]  news because they can't tell the people the truth because this is being done by design
[01:47.440 --> 01:51.800]  and the public would get mad if they found out their criminal government did this, Ted.
[01:51.800 --> 01:55.360]  Certainly get away from the US dollar, that's for sure. And that's what people should be
[01:55.360 --> 02:00.520]  doing at this time. When I talk about the US dollar, I'm not talking about our constitutional
[02:00.520 --> 02:03.720]  currency that we should have here in the United States of America.
[02:03.720 --> 02:07.200]  A private Federal Reserve. Yeah, there's a private Federal Reserve. It has nothing to
[02:07.200 --> 02:13.080]  do with the United States government or representation of US citizens. It has only to do with a private
[02:13.080 --> 02:16.320]  bank account. And we always told people it was dangerous to give them this power and
[02:16.320 --> 02:20.960]  they are engineering a mass riping. Ted, give them the gold and silver offer for the day.
[02:20.960 --> 02:25.120]  Again, right now I've got walking liberty rolls. If you pick them up right now, they're
[02:25.120 --> 02:30.600]  at 182. If you look at it, if you buy them by the coin, it's 188 per roll, but you get
[02:30.600 --> 02:35.360]  a discount on that. I also have the British sovereign coin. It's a great coin to get into
[02:35.360 --> 02:41.800]  small piece of gold. They're at $243 per coin. You really do need to get into small
[02:41.800 --> 02:47.960]  gold and you need to have small fractions of silver. Right now I also have the Frank
[02:47.960 --> 02:53.240]  coin, which we've talked a lot about to Alex. They're right now at 194 and we were talking
[02:53.240 --> 02:59.280]  about those back around January and they're sitting at about 200 and I think about 215
[02:59.280 --> 03:05.240]  at that time. The reason why the prices are low right now is just basically a seasonal
[03:05.240 --> 03:10.840]  thing. It's not low. It's up at 900 compared to what it was a year ago. Now, folks, it
[03:10.840 --> 03:17.800]  will go up in every time it has in the fall and they're talking about $5,000 an ounce.
[03:17.800 --> 03:23.280]  It's at 900 an ounce right now, 800-686-2237. Give them the gold coin, Ted.
[03:23.280 --> 03:27.440]  Yeah, right now the gold coin is the best one is the Frank right now at 194 and you
[03:27.440 --> 03:33.880]  can call us at 1-800-686-2237. Pick up your quantities of gold and silver now. Look at
[03:33.880 --> 03:37.600]  your portfolios. What do you have in stocks? What do you have in the bank? What do you
[03:37.600 --> 03:41.600]  have in the bond market? Where are you sitting in real estate? At this time, you should be
[03:41.600 --> 03:47.200]  taking a very serious look because the United States dollar is doomed because the foreigners
[03:47.200 --> 03:50.920]  want to get away from it and they're the ones who supported it when we're going through.
[03:50.920 --> 03:55.480]  Folks, do the right thing. Do the smart thing. I know you're going to buy gold from Ted and
[03:55.480 --> 03:59.560]  silver from Ted when it's exploding. It's sitting there right now. They're saying in
[03:59.560 --> 04:03.400]  the fall it's going to start racing towards 2000. I don't know what's going to happen,
[04:03.400 --> 04:07.120]  but I know the dollar's being devalued and that means gold's going to go up in the laws
[04:07.120 --> 04:14.840]  of finance and the laws of money, 800-686-2237, regardless. Let's say it stays the same.
[04:14.840 --> 04:22.040]  At least it isn't being devalued like your dollars or like everything else, 1-800-686-2237.
[04:22.040 --> 04:26.560]  A lot of you have never bought gold or silver. You can't imagine physically holding an asset.
[04:26.560 --> 04:30.840]  Buy one or two coins. Test it out. Buy a roll of silver dollars. They're great. They're
[04:30.840 --> 04:37.040]  hard to get right now. 800-686-2237. The brokers are there right now. Tell them it's an
[04:37.040 --> 04:42.040]  Alex Jones special or it's going to cost more. Those are literally yet cost 800-686-2237.
[04:42.040 --> 04:47.160]  Ted, thanks for coming on with us. Hey, thanks for having me up again, Alex. Bloomberg says
[04:47.160 --> 04:55.280]  $5,000 an ounce gold. May I have everybody's attention, please? I've come with a message
[04:55.280 --> 05:00.680]  of information. 9-11 was an inside job. Do you like being a puppet, sir? Do you like
[05:00.680 --> 05:04.400]  being a puppet for the New World Order? I'll do the American people know that 9-11 was
[05:04.400 --> 05:08.440]  the stage. It was engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the fallout or commission, the
[05:08.440 --> 05:15.600]  CEPAR. The day that we stop asking questions is the day that we have allowed the seeds
[05:15.600 --> 05:21.480]  of despotism to grow at our own door. Seven years after the attacks of September 11, a
[05:21.480 --> 05:31.800]  global awakening has taken place. An inside job. How dare you? If you know that there's
[05:31.800 --> 05:35.520]  treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself. All hell is breaking
[05:35.520 --> 05:40.320]  loose on 6th Avenue. And if the government has not told the truth in five years, we
[05:40.320 --> 05:45.840]  will be here on the 10th anniversary of life. Please rise. Download the film at prisonplanet.tv
[05:45.840 --> 05:50.720]  right now or get the DVD at infowars.com. It's now time to take the revolution to the
[05:50.720 --> 05:55.480]  next level. Of the 3 million plus edible food plants that grow on earth, no other single
[05:55.480 --> 06:00.560]  plant can compare with the nutritional value of the powder, seeds and oil of the hemp plant.

[07:58.240 --> 08:04.600]  war continues. It's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network. We're going to be talking
[08:04.600 --> 08:13.160]  to an individual who, for more than 50 years, is coming up on 50+. They've been fighting
[08:13.160 --> 08:17.760]  the New World Order. We've been having icons on the show, like G. Edward Griffin and many
[08:17.760 --> 08:22.040]  others, but I really can't think of anybody when it comes to really delving deeply into
[08:22.040 --> 08:28.320]  the New World Order and exposing so many dark secrets that we now just take as commonplace
[08:28.320 --> 08:32.840]  knowledge. So much of it was pioneered and rediscovered because it was all there in
[08:32.840 --> 08:37.520]  the ancient documents and texts by Jordan Maxwell. So we'll be talking to him in just
[08:37.520 --> 08:38.520]  one moment.
[08:38.520 --> 08:45.800]  Here we go to Jordan. You can pre-order my new film, 9-11 Chronicles, Truth Rising,
[08:45.800 --> 08:51.160]  part one, Truth Rising, and the way the world's going. Who knows if there'll be a part two?
[08:51.160 --> 08:54.920]  But it's got Willie Nelson in it. It's got Governor Jesse Ventura. It's got video interview
[08:54.920 --> 09:00.400]  with George Carlin who died last night, of course, in Southern California of heart failure,
[09:00.400 --> 09:03.280]  talking about how the government wouldn't have an investigation in 9-11. They wouldn't
[09:03.280 --> 09:10.240]  investigate something they did. They wouldn't investigate themselves. But I mean, it's got
[09:10.240 --> 09:17.960]  everybody. Martin Sheen, it's got the head of democracy now saying 9-11 should be investigated.
[09:17.960 --> 09:22.320]  Building 7 should be investigated. Michael Moore saying it could be an inside job and
[09:22.320 --> 09:27.360]  that firefighters have told him there were bombs in the buildings. But we've got to expand
[09:27.360 --> 09:31.520]  the description that's up on the infowars.com shopping cart because it mainly gets into how
[09:31.520 --> 09:37.000]  we confront Schwarzenegger and how we confront Lynn Cheney and how just all these people
[09:37.000 --> 09:38.000]  get confronted.
[09:38.000 --> 09:44.840]  Hundreds of people. Barack Obama, I mean, the list goes on and on. Both presidential candidates,
[09:44.840 --> 09:51.840]  Barack Obama and, of course, John McCain, with We Are Changed and 9-11 Truth and everybody,
[09:51.840 --> 10:01.600]  the video of, of course, We Are Changed LA basically taking over Bill Maher's show.
[10:01.600 --> 10:06.560]  So it's a story of people standing up, taking action, having a great effect, confronting
[10:06.560 --> 10:12.320]  Bill Clinton, Hillary, Bill Clinton blowing up, admitting Bohemian Grove, admitting Bilderberg,
[10:12.320 --> 10:19.640]  meltdowns, the media saying kill us, arrest us. But woven through this is the firefighters'
[10:19.640 --> 10:23.920]  police and military and EMTs dying of the dust, the government documents where they
[10:23.920 --> 10:30.560]  knew it was going to kill them and decided not to give them healthcare. All of that is
[10:30.560 --> 10:39.320]  in the film and it just completely devastates their official story. Truth Rising will ship
[10:39.320 --> 10:40.320]  July 5th.
[10:40.320 --> 10:47.400]  So the official release dates July 4th. It will be on PrisonPlanet.tv midnight, the day
[10:47.400 --> 10:53.280]  July 4th starts. So it's July 3rd ends, that Thursday, on that Friday morning throughout
[10:53.280 --> 10:57.640]  Friday, it will be posted in a bunch of different formats, DivX formats, you can burn it to
[10:57.640 --> 11:02.200]  disk, get it out to people in higher quality, Flash, a bunch of other systems, super high
[11:02.200 --> 11:08.120]  quality for PrisonPlanet.tv members, get it out to people, folks. And yes, you can order
[11:08.120 --> 11:13.280]  the DVD now. The DVD is being mass replicated right now. I'm supposed to get them middle
[11:13.280 --> 11:18.080]  of next week and so we will have them before it even ships and then we'll be packaging
[11:18.080 --> 11:22.880]  them up later next week and they will all ship out on that Saturday and then that next
[11:22.880 --> 11:33.360]  Monday after July 4th. So get your 9-11 Chronicles, Truth Rising is dead, infowars.com. Okay.
[11:33.360 --> 11:38.240]  I'm really excited about having Jordan Maxwell on the show. I kind of woke up with a new
[11:38.240 --> 11:46.160]  order on my own or kind of on the John Burt Society route. Wasn't part of the John Burt
[11:46.160 --> 11:50.640]  Society but read stuff like Nundare, Call of Conspiracy, The Private Fellow Reserve
[11:50.640 --> 11:55.440]  and then I learned about Ron Paul 15 years ago and got a radio show and was kind of a
[11:55.440 --> 11:59.280]  mainline conservative Republican who was anti-New World Order. Then I found out that that party
[11:59.280 --> 12:08.600]  was controlled. I mean, even as late as 1998, 99, I wouldn't get into the occult on air.
[12:08.600 --> 12:12.360]  I wouldn't talk about it. I didn't believe it. I thought, hey, the fellow reserves private,
[12:12.360 --> 12:16.880]  they do want a world government for their administrative convenience. It is bad but
[12:16.880 --> 12:21.720]  there's no occult and you know, that's a bunch of, there's dumb conspiracy theorist, there's
[12:21.720 --> 12:26.360]  no black helicopters, there's no FEMA camp plans and then Delta Force invaded Texas.
[12:26.360 --> 12:30.120]  They bribed police chiefs. I interviewed them. I found out they had martial law plans with
[12:30.120 --> 12:34.960]  the San Antonio police chief, the emergency managers and then I found out about Bohemian
[12:34.960 --> 12:40.320]  Grove and I found out it was real and I infiltrated it and so, so really, you know, I am a Johnny
[12:40.320 --> 12:46.720]  come lately. Doesn't matter. We're all Johnny come lately. You know, in this short life
[12:46.720 --> 12:52.440]  we have, the point is we can all move forward, take action and then I remember Chris Athanus
[12:52.440 --> 12:58.440]  in about 98, 99 putting Jordan Maxwell videos on. Local access and I remember watching those
[12:58.440 --> 13:03.160]  and looking into it and I already knew a lot of Egyptian history and other history and
[13:03.160 --> 13:06.600]  so I knew it was accurate because I'd already independently learned it but never put it into
[13:06.600 --> 13:11.160]  thought of what was happening today. So he really helped wake me up to a larger world
[13:11.160 --> 13:16.480]  and larger view and Jordan Maxwell continues as a preeminent researcher, an independent
[13:16.480 --> 13:20.200]  scholar in the field of occult, religious philosophy. His interest in these subjects
[13:20.200 --> 13:25.280]  began far back as 59. He served for three and a half years as the regional editor of
[13:25.280 --> 13:31.320]  True Seeker magazine, America's oldest free thought journal since 1873. His work exploring
[13:31.320 --> 13:35.440]  the hidden foundations of western religions and secret societies creates enthusiastic
[13:35.440 --> 13:40.600]  responses from audiences around the world. He has conducted dozens of intense seminars,
[13:40.600 --> 13:45.080]  hosted his own radio talk show, guest on more than 600 radio shows and written, produced
[13:45.080 --> 13:48.760]  and appeared in numerous television shows and documentaries including the two hour special
[13:48.760 --> 13:53.360]  for CBS TV network as well as internationally acclaimed five part ancient mystery series,
[13:53.360 --> 13:57.720]  all devoted to understanding ancient religions and their pervasive influence on world affairs
[13:57.720 --> 14:02.480]  today. His works on the subject of secret societies both ancient and modern and their
[14:02.480 --> 14:09.200]  symbols has fascinated audiences around the world for decades considering the rapidly
[14:09.200 --> 14:13.800]  moving events of today and the very real part these hidden religious agendas play in our
[14:13.800 --> 14:18.440]  modern war-torn world. He feels that controversial subjects are not only interesting to explore
[14:18.440 --> 14:23.000]  but too important to ignore. His extraordinary presentations include documents and photographs
[14:23.000 --> 14:27.960]  seldom seen elsewhere. Now we can argue about our interpretation of what Jordan says but
[14:27.960 --> 14:33.000]  I agree with the info he brings out. I may even disagree with some of his interpretations
[14:33.000 --> 14:38.320]  on certain things. It's very complex and nuanced but regardless we should all have debates
[14:38.320 --> 14:45.160]  about these subjects. He gets into astrophiology, sexual symbolism and world religions, foundations
[14:45.160 --> 14:49.440]  of modern-day religions, secret societies and toxic religion, world mysteries, ancient
[14:49.440 --> 14:53.720]  modern, ancient symbols and occult emblems, ancient sciences and technologies, hidden
[14:53.720 --> 14:57.760]  Bible teachings and mysteries, the sun and the history of politics and religion, the
[14:57.760 --> 15:02.000]  story your church doesn't want you to know, secret societies and their influence on world
[15:02.000 --> 15:06.720]  events and we may even hold him over a little bit into overdrive today but I wanted to properly
[15:06.720 --> 15:11.920]  introduce him. Jordan doesn't like to talk about himself but he does have cancer. He
[15:11.920 --> 15:15.840]  is not doing well financially. I've heard him on a lot of shows over the years. He never
[15:15.840 --> 15:21.640]  seems to plug his great books and videos. Go to his website, jordanmaxwell.com and buy
[15:21.640 --> 15:26.160]  some of the books and videos and support the guy and it will open up your mind and help
[15:26.160 --> 15:31.920]  you wake up to other issues. Support Jordan Maxwell because he's had 50 plus years of
[15:31.920 --> 15:39.240]  fight the new world order and we need to support this gentleman today so jordanmaxwell.com.
[15:39.240 --> 15:46.680]  Thank you for coming on with us. Well thank you Alex for having me on. I can't tell you
[15:46.680 --> 15:54.360]  how much I appreciate your support and things you've said and I thank you for it. It's true
[15:54.360 --> 16:02.720]  that I was interested in these subjects as far back as when I was a teenager and even
[16:02.720 --> 16:08.360]  earlier when I was a kid I used to ask my parents and ask the adults around me questions
[16:08.360 --> 16:14.800]  and they just would look at me with glassy eyes and they had no idea in the world what
[16:14.800 --> 16:22.000]  I was talking about and consequently I just never understood why people weren't interested
[16:22.000 --> 16:31.840]  in the things that I was. And so at 18 years old I moved to California and by myself ended
[16:31.840 --> 16:38.440]  up in Los Angeles with $9 in my pocket, no family, no friends here, and no idea in the
[16:38.440 --> 16:43.920]  world what I was going to do with my life but I ended up in LA with $9 in my pocket
[16:43.920 --> 16:50.960]  and downtown LA and somehow or another I lived through all of it but I was fascinated with
[16:50.960 --> 16:57.200]  how much people don't know and how much people don't care to know. And I hear people today
[16:57.200 --> 17:03.840]  say why doesn't the government tell us the truth and why doesn't these educational institutes
[17:03.840 --> 17:11.080]  really tell us the truth. I think it's because they, the Illuminati, know that we generally
[17:11.080 --> 17:15.480]  speaking don't want the truth. We don't want to hear the truth.
[17:15.480 --> 17:19.720]  Now I've had Jordan Alitas come up to me, I mean high level members of government and
[17:19.720 --> 17:24.560]  others and say, Alex, and they always say this is off record, right? Now I'm a journalist
[17:24.560 --> 17:28.760]  so it has to be off record. And they say, look the slaves don't want to know, you're
[17:28.760 --> 17:32.640]  basically one of us, you want to be enlightened, you can't help them, you might as well just
[17:32.640 --> 17:33.640]  take care of yourself.
[17:33.640 --> 17:39.600]  Well that's what I'm saying, I mean I have to say that that is pretty much true and
[17:39.600 --> 17:45.240]  then I also want to ask the question, how important is it to tell the people the real
[17:45.240 --> 17:54.040]  truth? I mean like the movie with, you know, when the military guy was asked by the kid,
[17:54.040 --> 17:56.880]  you know, well what do you want? He said, I want to know the truth and he said, you
[17:56.880 --> 18:04.080]  can't handle the truth. How important is it to tell people the real truth? Because what
[18:04.080 --> 18:08.840]  you're doing, and I've learned this the hard way, what you're doing is you're putting your
[18:08.840 --> 18:15.480]  life on the line for people who will be entertained for a while hearing you, but they will go
[18:15.480 --> 18:19.880]  on with their regular lives as they always have watching basketball and doing what they
[18:19.880 --> 18:27.400]  normally do, and life will go on, of course you had the big mouth and was telling people
[18:27.400 --> 18:34.160]  something that they weren't supposed to know, so you end up in trouble, maybe even end
[18:34.160 --> 18:41.120]  up dead or in prison, the internal revenue finds a bad comma on your tax records and
[18:41.120 --> 18:46.440]  now you can go to prison and that way they'll shut you up, and all because you were trying
[18:46.440 --> 18:50.360]  to help your fellow man who, while you're sitting in prison, they're out at the kid's
[18:50.360 --> 18:54.240]  baseball game because they were just entertained by you.
[18:54.240 --> 18:57.720]  Jordan, I think what you're saying is people don't need to take this for granted. They
[18:57.720 --> 19:02.920]  need to appreciate your work, my work, so many others because it's dangerous and it's
[19:02.920 --> 19:03.920]  valuable, so...
[19:03.920 --> 19:06.600]  You've got that right, boy, that's exactly right.
[19:06.600 --> 19:10.520]  So the question is, are we casting pearls before swine? We've got a break, Jordan, a
[19:10.520 --> 19:14.960]  quick break, we'll come back, you've got the floor, but I want to do this interview a little
[19:14.960 --> 19:18.440]  bit different than other interviews because you don't like talking about yourself. I want
[19:18.440 --> 19:22.520]  to make you talk about your history, your awakening because I've found talking about
[19:22.520 --> 19:27.120]  people's awakenings tends to wake others up, your journey, and then I want to get into
[19:27.120 --> 19:33.360]  the basics of the New World Order, their greatest secrets, kind of Jordan Maxwell's greatest
[19:33.360 --> 19:38.160]  hits because I want to understand your life, your awakening, and then where you see the
[19:38.160 --> 19:43.120]  New World Order going and we'll take calls. Jordan Maxwell is our guest, he isn't feeling
[19:43.120 --> 19:48.160]  well today, but we'll be with us for the next hour and 40 minutes, maybe longer, we'll see,
[19:48.160 --> 19:49.160]  stay with us.
[19:49.160 --> 19:57.280]  Good day, Jim Newcomer from Midas Resources, September 12, 2008. Gold opened at $756 this
[19:57.280 --> 20:03.800]  morning. One ounce gold coins can be purchased for $779.28, $389.64 for half ounce, and $194.82
[20:03.800 --> 20:09.400]  for quarter ounce. That's $779.28, $389.64, and $194.82.
[20:09.400 --> 20:16.880]  On June 4, 1963, an unknown presidential decree, Executive Order 11110 was signed with the authority
[20:16.880 --> 20:21.120]  to strip the Federal Reserve Bank of its power to lend money to the United States government
[20:21.120 --> 20:25.120]  and interest. With a stroke of a pen, Kennedy would have put the Fed out of business. The
[20:25.120 --> 20:29.320]  November assassination quieted the production of the new currency, however the Executive
[20:29.320 --> 20:37.240]  Order still stands unrepealed. Midas has the Kennedy v. Fed document, call 800-686-2237.
[20:37.240 --> 20:43.720]  Unlike your liberty, the paper is free. Call 800-686-2237. If you're interested in breaking
[20:43.720 --> 20:51.760]  the bondage of taxation and debt, call 800-686-2237. That's 800-686-2237.
[20:51.760 --> 20:57.000]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war
[20:57.000 --> 21:02.760]  against this country. The enemy struck America on September 11. But who is the enemy?
[21:02.760 --> 21:07.880]  We have to look to the Middle East. We have to look to Osama bin Laden.
[21:07.880 --> 21:12.520]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence
[21:12.520 --> 21:17.320]  networks inside the United States. Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis
[21:17.320 --> 21:24.080]  again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S. I'm aware that some Israeli citizens
[21:24.080 --> 21:28.040]  have been detained. In Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers
[21:28.040 --> 21:32.780]  ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings
[21:32.780 --> 21:37.640]  in war games, the shadow government, and much, much more. Fabled Enemies, get the DVD

[22:02.440 --> 22:07.760]  even less secure. The RFID tags and ID cards have been proven to be not secure. Thieves
[22:07.760 --> 22:12.560]  are able to read information stored on these tags to steal your identity. Protect yourself

[24:39.960 --> 24:45.400]  Let's start off with, you get there with less than 20 bucks in your pocket in LA when
[24:45.400 --> 24:52.040]  you're 13 years old. Go through your life, your awakening process, some of the people
[24:52.040 --> 24:57.600]  you ran into over the years, and what that awakening was like.
[24:57.600 --> 25:04.040]  Well, yeah, I was 18 when I came to Los Angeles and I had no idea why. I just felt I had to
[25:04.040 --> 25:09.520]  go somewhere. Originally, I'm from the South and from Florida and I ended up in Los Angeles
[25:09.520 --> 25:17.840]  back in 59. I had no idea why I was here or what I was going to do with my life, but I
[25:17.840 --> 25:25.440]  just was drawn to the fact that I wanted to know. So many people today just don't want
[25:25.440 --> 25:33.680]  to know. That's what drove me. I've done what I have done with nothing for so many years
[25:33.680 --> 25:40.520]  because I have always appreciated the people who made themselves available for me by doing
[25:40.520 --> 25:48.280]  tapes and records and lectures and teachers who I could go to to learn the things that
[25:48.280 --> 25:56.080]  my heart was burning to know. I would attend all the lectures I could, read everything
[25:56.080 --> 26:01.480]  I could get my hands on because I wanted to know and I really appreciated those people
[26:01.480 --> 26:07.840]  many years ago that were there out on the front lines like you are today making the
[26:07.840 --> 26:13.840]  information available so that I could learn. So that's what I wanted to do with my life
[26:13.840 --> 26:21.400]  at 19 years old is to gather up as much information as possible and make it available to all that
[26:21.400 --> 26:28.280]  wanted to hear. So I was very idealistic about that, but I discovered something. I'll tell
[26:28.280 --> 26:33.760]  you a big secret that I discovered that took me many years to figure it out, but people
[26:33.760 --> 26:40.960]  will always support what they want to hear. They will not support what they don't want
[26:40.960 --> 26:45.560]  to hear. And if you like country music, you're not going to pay money for an opera. If you
[26:45.560 --> 26:50.280]  like classical music, you're not going to pay money to go to an acid rock concert. So
[26:50.280 --> 26:56.000]  people will always support what they want to hear. And so I always assumed as a young
[26:56.000 --> 27:02.760]  person that people were like me. They wanted to know the truth. And so I later on discovered
[27:02.760 --> 27:11.320]  that no, most of the time people do not want to know the truth. They will look at something,
[27:11.320 --> 27:17.560]  see that it's wrong, and then prefer to, as Churchill said, every now and then you'll
[27:17.560 --> 27:22.080]  stumble on the truth, but then you'll pick yourself up, brush yourself off and go on
[27:22.080 --> 27:26.280]  and act like you never saw it, and just go on and live your life and go to the ball game
[27:26.280 --> 27:33.440]  and have a good time. And one day what comes around goes around. One day what you should
[27:33.440 --> 27:39.440]  have looked at, you should have been concerned about, well, when it comes to you finally,
[27:39.440 --> 27:45.880]  and you finally have to see what you could have seen years ago, but you didn't want to.
[27:45.880 --> 27:51.680]  Well, that's what I wanted to do is to make this kind of information that I was interested
[27:51.680 --> 27:58.160]  in available to everyone. And you mentioned John Burt's Society. As far back as 19, I
[27:58.160 --> 28:06.240]  think they were founded in 1959 in Belmont, Massachusetts, where I used to send research
[28:06.240 --> 28:14.120]  articles to Belmont back in 1961, 62, and 63 to the Burt's Society as it just kept going.
[28:14.120 --> 28:20.840]  I was doing a lot of research on my own, on fascism, Nazism, communism, all of the different
[28:20.840 --> 28:26.600]  movements of the bankers, et cetera. And so I would just send again articles, and sometimes
[28:26.600 --> 28:34.720]  I'd see some of my work being incorporated into their literature. And then I began to
[28:34.720 --> 28:41.400]  connect with all kinds of researchers and writers. And the more I learned, the more
[28:41.400 --> 28:48.120]  I realized how much I don't know. And I realized too that most people don't want to know.
[28:48.120 --> 28:54.800]  And that's what really frightened me, because now we're faced with something that is just
[28:54.800 --> 29:03.000]  absolutely beyond most people's ability to even grasp. And I have no words for it, because
[29:03.000 --> 29:11.240]  I know that this country and this republic cannot be saved as long as there's a flaw
[29:11.240 --> 29:17.600]  in the thinking of the people. Look at your decisions in life are only as good as your
[29:17.600 --> 29:24.640]  information. And if you are not willing to look at all of the truth, then you don't have
[29:24.640 --> 29:29.640]  it yet. And as long as you don't have it all, any attorney will tell you before going in
[29:29.640 --> 29:35.440]  the court, if you don't have everything going for you, then don't go. Don't even try because
[29:35.440 --> 29:40.880]  you're not going to win because you don't know the facts yet. So that's what I'm trying
[29:40.880 --> 29:41.880]  to do.
[29:41.880 --> 29:52.000]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[29:52.000 --> 29:56.040]  Our beloved republic is on her knees. The forces of globalism are destroying national
[29:56.040 --> 30:00.840]  sovereignty worldwide. But in Liberty's darkest hour there is hope. The first time in modern
[30:00.840 --> 30:05.680]  history the people are beginning to wake up. It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate
[30:05.680 --> 30:09.560]  their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order master plan. We have a short time
[30:09.560 --> 30:15.360]  frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat. In the Info War, PrisonPlanet.tv

[34:10.960 --> 34:18.160]  notes, about 20 pages of notes of what I thought was most important in life. One of the things
[34:18.160 --> 34:24.400]  I wrote in here is that I was thinking about what makes me up, who I am. I thought about
[34:24.400 --> 34:28.880]  being a young man and being ego driven and wanting to be tough and good looking and wanting
[34:28.880 --> 34:36.920]  to get in fights with bullies and kind of those base type things you do when you're young,
[34:36.920 --> 34:43.000]  but that's normal. It's a hierarchy of needs. It's a journey we're all on. I thought about
[34:43.000 --> 34:48.600]  how I still fall back into ego sometimes, but less and less. It's almost like a long
[34:48.600 --> 34:55.280]  lost forgotten friend because it's a great source of energy ego, but it also blinds you.
[34:55.280 --> 35:00.600]  I remember decades ago, people would tell me about ego. I couldn't even grasp the concept
[35:00.600 --> 35:05.520]  even in psychology class because I was still so controlled by ego when I was 18, 19 years
[35:05.520 --> 35:11.320]  old, but now I understand what it is. I'm totally separate from my quote mind. I can
[35:11.320 --> 35:17.040]  pull back, look at myself warts and all. I can analyze what makes humans tick, how we
[35:17.040 --> 35:23.560]  operate the basic engineering, the basic genetics, what our true values are, what we're truly
[35:23.560 --> 35:31.400]  meant to do. And at the final equation, laying down your life for your neighbor means that
[35:31.400 --> 35:34.400]  you save yourself because when you have that attitude of laying down your life for your
[35:34.400 --> 35:37.920]  neighbor, when you do have courage, when you do care about others, when you're not greedy
[35:37.920 --> 35:42.200]  and filled with hate, when you're not just self centered, you truly are conscious and
[35:42.200 --> 35:46.440]  can now use your brain and you understand that in a society where we care about each
[35:46.440 --> 35:50.440]  other and that means sometimes fighting against evil. That doesn't mean just laying back and
[35:50.440 --> 35:55.420]  being a wimp, that you have a better society, a dynamic system. Does it mean we're ever
[35:55.420 --> 36:02.000]  perfect? No, but we're reaching towards something better. And being there at the beach, laying
[36:02.000 --> 36:06.440]  in the sand, watching my children play and build sandcastles and seeing God's beautiful
[36:06.440 --> 36:14.520]  creation, the firmament, just looking at how wonderful this world is and how Madison Avenue
[36:14.520 --> 36:20.080]  has trained us to feel inadequate, to be unhappy, to not see how great things are, but to not
[36:20.080 --> 36:23.960]  also be able to see all the evils in the world at the same time. People are basically blind
[36:23.960 --> 36:28.800]  to the beauty and blind to the ugliness. They've been stunted and kind of shrunken down. They're
[36:28.800 --> 36:36.800]  looking at the world through a straw. They're seeing such a limited perspective. And I have
[36:36.800 --> 36:42.760]  a desire to see them have pleasure. I have a desire to see them be free. I have a desire
[36:42.760 --> 36:47.560]  to see them do well. I have a desire, kind of a builder's desire, which is what we're
[36:47.560 --> 36:54.120]  all meant to be creators, to see their minds unlocked. And I have a desire to learn more
[36:54.120 --> 37:00.560]  and to challenge myself and to really know the truth. And it's painful to realize that
[37:00.560 --> 37:04.160]  a lot of them don't want to do that, and they want to be caught in snares, and they want
[37:04.160 --> 37:08.220]  to be killed, and they want to have fluoride put in their water, and they want to be injected
[37:08.220 --> 37:12.560]  with cancer, and they want to give their kids mercury shots, and they don't want to know
[37:12.560 --> 37:16.800]  the truth. And I wanted to ask Jordan this question, or make the statement and get his
[37:16.800 --> 37:25.360]  take on it. And I wrote here in a little book that I realized that the instinct to want
[37:25.360 --> 37:30.560]  to build something better for the tribe is a human instinct, and to realize that the
[37:30.560 --> 37:37.240]  human community is bigger than just yourself, and that I want to pass better things on to
[37:37.240 --> 37:41.800]  people, and that all the good things we have is because other good people before us pass
[37:41.800 --> 37:47.600]  them on to us. And there's always been this struggle of good and evil within our own species
[37:47.600 --> 37:52.120]  that's being directed and controlled from above, and you can debate what that intelligence
[37:52.120 --> 37:57.240]  is. And Jordan gets into that, but certainly for those that have studied, it's there, and
[37:57.240 --> 38:02.520]  the elite know it's there, and communicate with it, with both sides of it, or whatever
[38:02.520 --> 38:09.280]  it is. God, but then they control it and put out a false facsimile for the public. But
[38:09.280 --> 38:14.240]  my only message is, is that I'm not just some do-gooder. I want to transmit knowledge. I
[38:14.240 --> 38:18.200]  want to tell people the mistakes I've made. I want to let them know. I want them to see
[38:18.200 --> 38:23.800]  pitfalls. And I want to write. I want to make films. And it's because I want to communicate
[38:23.800 --> 38:29.880]  with the future. And I can almost feel tangibly. I do feel it, but I, you know, is it a facsimile
[38:29.880 --> 38:34.960]  in my mind, or is it real? The bouncing back from the future, the information I've already
[38:34.960 --> 38:40.360]  put out, I can feel the good it's created, and I can feel it tangibly coming back at
[38:40.360 --> 38:45.720]  me from the future. And I know that I stand on the shoulders of those in the past, and
[38:45.720 --> 38:53.080]  I can feel myself with my ancestors and others looking back into the past and into the future.
[38:53.080 --> 38:56.720]  And if you really look down at what makes Alex Jones tick, at the end of the day, when
[38:56.720 --> 39:01.360]  Jordan was just talking, I was going to share this later in the week, it's that I want to
[39:01.360 --> 39:05.600]  make things better for those in the future. Because I live on through them. I live on
[39:05.600 --> 39:10.760]  through their pleasure and their pain and their exultation and the births and the deaths
[39:10.760 --> 39:17.320]  and the lives that were all part of a larger species, like a cell in a larger organism.
[39:17.320 --> 39:22.640]  And the New World Order knows that and tries to block us off from ever becoming truly human
[39:22.640 --> 39:26.920]  and communing with our own species in the universe. Jordan, I didn't mean to spend five
[39:26.920 --> 39:30.080]  minutes because I want to hear everything you have to say, but I wanted to say that
[39:30.080 --> 39:33.840]  to you because when you talked about wanting to know, wanting to warn others, having this
[39:33.840 --> 39:39.600]  drive, this instinct, and I absolutely am a kindred spirit with you on that point is
[39:39.600 --> 39:43.760]  that I have this desire to warn people and to know and to learn more myself.
[39:43.760 --> 39:50.960]  Well, Alex, I'm so happy that you said those things because that's exactly what I was
[39:50.960 --> 39:57.000]  going to say. And I'm older and more tired than you are. So you said it so much better
[39:57.000 --> 40:02.520]  than I would have said it. That's exactly what I feel. Precisely what you said is exactly
[40:02.520 --> 40:09.200]  what I feel. When I was younger, I was filled with the zeal for knowledge and wisdom and
[40:09.200 --> 40:16.800]  understanding it and questioning everything and talking to all the adults that were out
[40:16.800 --> 40:22.440]  there writing and speaking publicly. I loved knowledge and I loved the idea of helping
[40:22.440 --> 40:28.320]  my fellow man. I loved watching young people, their eyes light up when you show them something
[40:28.320 --> 40:34.920]  they've never seen before. It's the instinct of a teacher. And the more the older I grew,
[40:34.920 --> 40:41.080]  the more I loved talking to audiences and helping them to understand because like the
[40:41.080 --> 40:47.000]  apostle Paul says, do you not teach yourself when helping others? So I was learning and
[40:47.000 --> 40:51.960]  I was trying to transmit all the things I was learning to other people. But when I took
[40:51.960 --> 40:58.720]  my work publicly, back in 1988, I decided to go public and instead of the little Mickey
[40:58.720 --> 41:06.120]  Mouse venues that I had been speaking at, the little mom and pop book store.
[41:06.120 --> 41:13.520]  You emerged from the underground. Yes. I had been speaking at little venues, small little
[41:13.520 --> 41:21.560]  venues around Los Angeles. As far back as 1961 and 62, I was giving lectures in libraries
[41:21.560 --> 41:29.760]  and little small groups, ladies home groups and all these little venues on secret societies,
[41:29.760 --> 41:37.080]  Bible codes, Knights Templars, Nazi fascism, all of the different secret societies that
[41:37.080 --> 41:42.200]  were operating and how they were connected behind the scenes in European bloodlines.
[41:42.200 --> 41:50.880]  All of that back in 60s, early 60s, but it wasn't until I was introduced to the work
[41:50.880 --> 41:57.480]  of Myron Fagan, Anthony Hilde put out the records set on Illuma Naughty that was in
[41:57.480 --> 42:03.480]  late 66. Well, I got a copy of it almost right after they came out and all the pieces
[42:03.480 --> 42:09.160]  came together. All of it came together and all began to make sense of the things which
[42:09.160 --> 42:14.480]  I was already interested in. Let me interrupt briefly and see if you're on the same page
[42:14.480 --> 42:19.480]  or can expand. And this is for people that are listeners of mine and think that I know
[42:19.480 --> 42:23.400]  more, Jordan knows more than you do. Let me explain something. When you get so close to
[42:23.400 --> 42:27.720]  a problem and you understand the different sectors of it, you can be called a master
[42:27.720 --> 42:33.720]  of understanding the New World Order. As Jordan said, you realize how much you don't know.
[42:33.720 --> 42:39.040]  And so I would imagine you discovered thousands of things that Myron Fagan didn't know, but
[42:39.040 --> 42:46.920]  that was the last piece or the master key, the Rosetta Stone that the tumblers flipped
[42:46.920 --> 42:51.560]  and then you went, because I know your research to a whole new level past him, but we have
[42:51.560 --> 42:55.560]  to understand that it was that step that brought you to the next level and then you bring
[42:55.560 --> 43:00.920]  others and then you learn more from new people and then we just exponentially learn. Go ahead.
[43:00.920 --> 43:09.480]  That's exactly right. And so I was then on the track of Illuma Naughty as a philosophical
[43:09.480 --> 43:18.880]  concept. And so I was living in UCLA, libraries, USC, Berkeley, I was all over the state and
[43:18.880 --> 43:24.200]  going to, I personally went to all of those because we didn't have the computers and the
[43:24.200 --> 43:31.280]  thing, you know, the technology we have today. So I personally spent years at UCLA's research
[43:31.280 --> 43:40.000]  library, general research, USC, I used to spend days and weeks and months at USC and
[43:40.000 --> 43:47.080]  the stacks late at night photocopying documents from old books. And so the more I learned,
[43:47.080 --> 43:54.000]  the more I knew how much I didn't know. And I was fascinated with every day I was learning
[43:54.000 --> 44:00.600]  things and as a liftoff spirit was bringing me people and bringing things to me because
[44:00.600 --> 44:05.800]  it's as if the spirit in the universe knew that I wanted to know and that I was eager
[44:05.800 --> 44:12.800]  to learn. And so I was meeting all kinds of interesting people. And it was just blowing
[44:12.800 --> 44:20.480]  my mind. And then, like I said, about 1988, after I had a nervous breakdown because I
[44:20.480 --> 44:26.560]  lost my wife, I lost my family, I lost everything. But those things happened in life and but
[44:26.560 --> 44:32.000]  I wasn't ready for it and too much of it came too, too quickly and it just overwhelmed me
[44:32.000 --> 44:37.080]  and I just broke down. But when I came out, did you lose your wife because of the research
[44:37.080 --> 44:40.560]  was she sick of it? Yes, yeah, because she decided that she had
[44:40.560 --> 44:46.080]  had enough of me and whatever it was that was driving me, she wanted no part of it.
[44:46.080 --> 44:50.440]  All the time I was living with her, she never wanted to hear anything that I was interested
[44:50.440 --> 44:55.000]  in Richard Gage's wife, Parker Texan engineers, 911 truth, left him over this stuff. It's
[44:55.000 --> 45:00.720]  really sad. I'm blessed to have my wife. And so, and so I, you know, that was a terrible
[45:00.720 --> 45:06.040]  blow to me because she just decided she got enough that she doesn't, it doesn't want
[45:06.040 --> 45:10.840]  she used to tell me all the time, why don't you just get a job and be like everybody else
[45:10.840 --> 45:16.080]  and just go along to get along. And I said, my God did not bring me into this world to
[45:16.080 --> 45:22.480]  go along to get along. My God brought me here to be who I am and to do what I do. I have
[45:22.480 --> 45:28.520]  a high respect for the, for the concept of the divine force in the universe that men
[45:28.520 --> 45:35.400]  call God. I believe that people, certain people are brought here purposely to do work. And
[45:35.400 --> 45:41.720]  so I have a very high regard for spiritual things. I have not for the, but not for the
[45:41.720 --> 45:45.960]  whorehouse churches that are eliminated. That's right. Yeah, not, not for the corporation's
[45:45.960 --> 45:52.460]  silly bull that we call the religions today jumping around on stages and what the church
[45:52.460 --> 45:58.040]  and diamond rings and their effeminate haircuts and jumping around falling down. And it's
[45:58.040 --> 46:05.720]  just an incredible display of stupidity. Look at, I'll think about this. If you were
[46:05.720 --> 46:13.000]  to go to a particular school for 40 years and study one subject for 40 years and one
[46:13.000 --> 46:21.360]  day come out of that, out of that 40 years of study and can't even read or form a sentence
[46:21.360 --> 46:28.360]  correctly and cannot hold an intelligent conversation with your fellow man, what kind of a school
[46:28.360 --> 46:33.720]  is that? That, that you spent all your life in and can't even read? Well, the same thing
[46:33.720 --> 46:39.000]  is true with so many Christians who have been Christians all their life and spent all their
[46:39.000 --> 46:47.480]  life pursuing a church teachings and have no idea in the world what certain words mean,
[46:47.480 --> 46:55.800]  the etymology of words and terms and symbols, corporate logos, flags, howlertry, where concepts
[46:55.800 --> 46:59.480]  have come from. The obelisk, it's all the complete opposite.
[46:59.480 --> 47:04.680]  The opposite, totally opposite than what you think it is. Well, well, I mean, that's
[47:04.680 --> 47:10.560]  the issue. And they have been hitting all those guys and it's turned out they get government
[47:10.560 --> 47:16.720]  financing to start them off to make it look stupid to actually turn spiritual people off.
[47:16.720 --> 47:20.440]  And I've noticed, I want to get your take on this, that the Illuminati, the globalist
[47:20.440 --> 47:27.000]  are all, whether it's Ted Turner, Maury Strong, Prince Philip, David Rockefeller, they're
[47:27.000 --> 47:35.080]  all deeply occultic, deeply into this Illuminati religion of killing their fellow humans for
[47:35.080 --> 47:40.200]  the greater good of Gaia, but then they finance all the atheist groups to tell people there's
[47:40.200 --> 47:45.840]  nothing. So, so, so they really want to turn people off from a true spiritual experience,
[47:45.840 --> 47:48.440]  something. That's exactly right. There is a world of
[47:48.440 --> 47:55.920]  difference between being religious and truly spiritual. A true spiritual person is exactly
[47:55.920 --> 48:01.320]  what the Bible has Jesus saying, go into your inner chambers, it goes someplace by yourself,
[48:01.320 --> 48:08.000]  and pray it, pray by yourself to your Father. You don't need to dance around on a stage
[48:08.000 --> 48:16.800]  with diamond rings and make a fool of jumping around. You know, spirituality is between
[48:16.800 --> 48:24.120]  you and your Creator. And I've always understood that. And I'm just amazed at how many people
[48:24.120 --> 48:33.480]  buy into, never even asking the questions, where are these people getting the money?
[48:33.480 --> 48:44.160]  It's just, I don't have words for it. TBN, typical TBN, they got statues of pagan gods
[48:44.160 --> 48:53.760]  in their yards, Bacchus Dionysus, one of the gods that has been used to represent Satan,
[48:53.760 --> 48:59.840]  is out there in TBN's courtyard. The very symbol that the Christianity has used for
[48:59.840 --> 49:05.560]  the devil is sitting in TBN's courtyard. But consequently, nobody reads, nobody questions.
[49:05.560 --> 49:11.280]  They also have copies of the Babylonian altar in some of their TV shows with plants sitting
[49:11.280 --> 49:14.880]  on it, right in front of everybody, the one that was in Ishtar's day.
[49:14.880 --> 49:18.320]  Right in your face, absolutely. What's the name of that altar that the Bible says is
[49:18.320 --> 49:21.720]  Satan's seat? And they have copies of it on TV right in front of you.
[49:21.720 --> 49:26.640]  Yeah, and the trees, the trees all around TBN, as you walk around, you'll see these
[49:26.640 --> 49:33.640]  spiral trees. Those spiral trees all over TBN's lot are called Shiva spellak. They're
[49:33.640 --> 49:40.840]  the symbolized, they symbolize the old Hindu religion, the erect spellak of Shiva, the
[49:40.840 --> 49:48.600]  god Shiva. And TBN has them everywhere, everywhere you go. You see sexual symbols, occult stuff,
[49:48.600 --> 49:51.680]  demonic symbols. And Crouch in Middley has all his homosexual
[49:51.680 --> 49:55.760]  mistresses, but then he speaks out against gay people on his show.
[49:55.760 --> 50:02.120]  And then publicly has all his male mistresses. And look at, I used to be, my friend died,
[50:02.120 --> 50:12.000]  but a very bright guy who was just an interesting man, lived down in Balboa, Ireland. I used
[50:12.000 --> 50:17.400]  to go down to see him, and he worked at a liquor store. He was very wealthy, but just
[50:17.400 --> 50:22.680]  to have something to do, he worked at a liquor store on the island, Balboa Island. And he
[50:22.680 --> 50:26.760]  used to tell me, I'd go down and sit on the wharf and talk with him about theology and
[50:26.760 --> 50:33.080]  religion. He's a very, very bright guy. And he would tell me, you know, in my liquor store,
[50:33.080 --> 50:39.520]  all the officials from TBN come and buy their booze, and they buy them by cases. Paul and
[50:39.520 --> 50:45.680]  Jane Crouch come down and buy thousands of dollars in booze and whiskey and all kinds
[50:45.680 --> 50:50.120]  and throw their big parties. And I was just thinking to myself, you know, the people are
[50:50.120 --> 50:56.640]  so stupid. A day unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act
[50:56.640 --> 51:02.520]  of war against this country. The enemy struck America on September 11th. But who is the
[51:02.520 --> 51:06.760]  enemy? Bin Laden. This is his MO. We have to look to the Middle East. We have to look
[51:06.760 --> 51:11.960]  to Osama Bin Laden. Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist
[51:11.960 --> 51:16.920]  ties to intelligence networks inside the United States. Some U.S. investigators believe that
[51:16.920 --> 51:23.200]  there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S. I'm aware that
[51:23.200 --> 51:28.480]  some Israeli citizens have been detained. Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers
[51:28.480 --> 51:33.200]  ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings
[51:33.200 --> 51:38.280]  in war games, the shadow government, and much, much more. Fabled enemies. Get the DVD at

[52:54.040 --> 52:58.800]  dollar or your own financial future? Is a dismal growth rate or rampant inflation affecting
[52:58.800 --> 53:02.640]  the bottom line of your retirement savings account? Do you worry about uncontrollable
[53:02.640 --> 53:06.720]  economic events which could suddenly wipe out some or all of your hard earned savings?
[53:06.720 --> 53:11.480]  You can turn adversity into opportunity. Digital retirement accounts and most 401Ks,

[53:34.920 --> 53:39.360]  if you'll need precious metals in your portfolio. It's a question of when. So whether you're

[53:44.320 --> 54:10.800]  us today at 1-866-323-5665. 1-866-323-5665.
[54:10.800 --> 54:39.600]  I love the part of this song that says there are many here among us who think that life
[54:39.600 --> 54:49.960]  is just a joke. The mind is an incredible thing. If they willfully want to be stupid
[54:49.960 --> 54:56.320]  and want to be in denial, their mind will engineer itself to build into that reality.
[54:56.320 --> 55:04.480]  That's what Jordan was saying earlier. They will decide to believe the lie. They will
[55:04.480 --> 55:11.520]  decide to be fools. I can have the Chicago Tribune admitting Dinecore and Halliburton,
[55:11.520 --> 55:16.520]  kidnapped over a million women and children, put them in slave camps, sell them to people
[55:16.520 --> 55:23.480]  to make snuff films. They even admit it in the newspaper. Nobody goes to jail. Trillions
[55:23.480 --> 55:27.920]  are missing from the Pentagon. I have all the government documents where they put cancer
[55:27.920 --> 55:33.840]  viruses in the vaccines, poisons in our water. You tell a yuppie that and they just laugh
[55:33.840 --> 55:41.520]  at you. It's funny to them. It's funny because they couldn't face the reality of how horrifying
[55:41.520 --> 55:48.160]  it really is. They are cowards. I'm not somebody full of courage. If somebody is attacking
[55:48.160 --> 55:53.760]  me, I want to stop it. These cowards are so cowardly, they could have a lion ripping their
[55:53.760 --> 55:58.120]  guts out and they'd probably deny it and go into a blackout and say, a lion isn't tearing
[55:58.120 --> 56:04.080]  my guts out. Kind of like the fellow being tortured in Brazil. He goes off into La La
[56:04.080 --> 56:07.600]  Land. At the end of the film, they're cutting his hand off and he's sitting there humming
[56:07.600 --> 56:12.400]  happily in his mind and they say, oh, he's left us. I'm afraid. The public has left
[56:12.400 --> 56:17.120]  us. I'm afraid. Jordan Maxwell, your take on the comments I just made.
[56:17.120 --> 56:22.000]  Boy, I can't comment on it because you said exactly what I'm thinking. That's precisely
[56:22.000 --> 56:27.920]  the point that the public has left their sanity. They have been robbed of their sanity and
[56:27.920 --> 56:35.960]  their humanity. I don't know what to do about it. At this point, I just do the best I can
[56:35.960 --> 56:41.360]  to try and help people who want to be helped. Those who don't want to hear, they're not
[56:41.360 --> 56:45.200]  going to hear it anyway. Finishing up with Crouch, though. I grew up
[56:45.200 --> 56:53.280]  by Bob Tilton, Larry Lee, a bunch of other preachers. I didn't see the Lees doing a
[56:53.280 --> 56:59.120]  bunch of partying, but with Tilton and some others, I saw incredible stuff that I won't
[56:59.120 --> 57:03.440]  even say on air in our neighborhood. Oh, I know. I can imagine. That's what
[57:03.440 --> 57:08.520]  I'm talking about, but people love it. Every time you turn on television, the police are
[57:08.520 --> 57:14.360]  just crowded with people and they're just enjoying it. What just blows my mind on this
[57:14.360 --> 57:23.160]  is that you see thousands and thousands of people coming to these churches to listen
[57:23.160 --> 57:33.120]  and they're learning nothing, actually intellectually learning nothing. And, you know, 20 years
[57:33.120 --> 57:38.640]  later, they're still jumping around, seeking the alms, and loving the Lord, and have no
[57:38.640 --> 57:44.240]  idea in the world how to read that the Lord is his bathroom at.
[57:44.240 --> 57:51.120]  Yeah. It's just incredible ignorance. People who cannot read, they don't think, they don't
[57:51.120 --> 57:59.040]  question anything. It's just, and that's why the entire human race is going under, because
[57:59.040 --> 58:03.120]  the human family have lost their ability to even think.
[58:03.120 --> 58:08.760]  Now, Jordan, we got to start the next hour, and it's only a 60-second break, a 70-second
[58:08.760 --> 58:12.800]  with the tags, so stay there. I really want to get into whatever it is you want to cover,
[58:12.800 --> 58:17.160]  whatever areas you want to cover when we get back. I want to bring up a few controversies,
[58:17.160 --> 58:23.080]  a few issues as well with you, and you've agreed, he's agreed to stay 20, 30 minutes
[58:23.080 --> 58:27.960]  in the next hour. After that, we've got him another hour and 20 minutes at least. Jordan
[58:27.960 --> 58:29.800]  Maxwell, straight ahead.
[58:29.800 --> 58:42.640]  You are listening to GCN. Visit GCNLive.com today.
[58:42.640 --> 58:48.400]  In September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to Ground Zero,
[58:48.400 --> 58:51.800]  and we knew what to do, or at least we thought we did.
[58:51.800 --> 58:57.040]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform
[58:57.040 --> 58:58.640]  to tell their story.
[58:58.640 --> 59:07.640]  Whitman, EPA director on the AT, made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[59:07.640 --> 59:12.400]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 Truth as brave souls throughout the world
[59:12.400 --> 59:14.640]  take action against their global masters.
[59:14.640 --> 59:18.680]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown. He takes his hand off
[59:18.680 --> 59:23.680]  and you hear three, two, one, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[59:23.680 --> 59:30.600]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide. Download Truth Rising at prisonplanet.tv and
[59:30.600 --> 59:36.400]  aggressively spread it worldwide, or order the DVD at infowars.com. If we don't expose
[59:36.400 --> 59:40.200]  the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial
[59:40.200 --> 59:44.800]  law.
[59:44.800 --> 1:00:05.800]  Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[1:00:05.800 --> 1:00:14.400]  Jordan Maxwell.com, Jordan J-O-R-D-A-N, Maxwell M-A-X, Whale.com, links up on infowars.com.
[1:00:14.400 --> 1:00:19.440]  He's into the rest of the hour with us and then for internet listeners and TV viewers
[1:00:19.440 --> 1:00:27.520]  at prisonplanet.tv, we'll continue about 20, maybe 30 minutes uninterrupted in the overdrive
[1:00:27.520 --> 1:00:33.760]  time to take phone calls. We'll do that off my phone system in my studio. So that is coming
[1:00:33.760 --> 1:00:38.760]  up at prisonplanet.tv viewers and folks listening on the infowars.com streams.
[1:00:38.760 --> 1:00:43.760]  Okay, going back to Jordan Maxwell, this is another short break and a long one's coming
[1:00:43.760 --> 1:00:47.360]  up, Jordan, but I'm going to go ahead and skip this break, too. Note the network so
[1:00:47.360 --> 1:00:54.080]  we can continue to 20 after. I never get into end fighting. I never really talk about groups
[1:00:54.080 --> 1:00:58.960]  fighting with each other. People try to even get us to pick fights with each other. They
[1:00:58.960 --> 1:01:04.360]  try to get other people to do it. I've noticed you never get involved in all that, Jordan,
[1:01:04.360 --> 1:01:09.760]  but you have pioneered so much of the research that is now the mainstay of a lot of people
[1:01:09.760 --> 1:01:15.680]  out there. And then I get people emailing me saying, what's going on with Jordan Maxwell
[1:01:15.680 --> 1:01:18.880]  and this researcher? What's going on with Jordan Maxwell and that researcher? And then
[1:01:18.880 --> 1:01:24.200]  I go look it up and find out you've said nothing or done nothing. And that's how the disinfo
[1:01:24.200 --> 1:01:29.920]  people are key at getting us to fight with each other. But just on record, tell me about
[1:01:29.920 --> 1:01:33.840]  some of the people you woke up to the New World Order, some of the people you educated
[1:01:33.840 --> 1:01:38.160]  who then kind of took your work and then added onto it or did their own thing. I mean, go
[1:01:38.160 --> 1:01:43.560]  through some of the folks that we could say that you first met or that you woke up.
[1:01:43.560 --> 1:01:52.280]  Well, classic example is back in 88 when I first started going public. I had a family
[1:01:52.280 --> 1:02:00.040]  that I was very close to out here. And one of the boys, I mean one of the girls in the
[1:02:00.040 --> 1:02:07.040]  family, a name which Gloria, Gloria was a young girl. She used to come over to my office
[1:02:07.040 --> 1:02:12.760]  in Glendale when I was first going public. And she would tell me about how she just
[1:02:12.760 --> 1:02:18.240]  loved what I was doing and loved all the research. And I knew her, I knew the family.
[1:02:18.240 --> 1:02:22.640]  And so I suspected nothing. And she asked if she could photocopy all my documents and
[1:02:22.640 --> 1:02:28.720]  materials that I was working on. And of course, so I gave her boxes upon boxes over a two-day
[1:02:28.720 --> 1:02:35.880]  period. It was a photocopy shop in the building I was in. So she just spent all day, all afternoon
[1:02:35.880 --> 1:02:41.320]  and all evening photocopying all the research materials and documents and everything that
[1:02:41.320 --> 1:02:47.160]  I had. And later on, about a year later, I get a phone call from a mutual friend that
[1:02:47.160 --> 1:02:52.800]  knew both Gloria and myself and said, Jordan, you know, there's a new book out with all
[1:02:52.800 --> 1:02:58.040]  of your work in it. The guy's name is Fritz Springmeyer. It's called Blood Lines of the
[1:02:58.040 --> 1:03:04.640]  Illuminati. And I was shocked. And so I called Fritz Springmeyer and I said, Fritz, what
[1:03:04.640 --> 1:03:11.000]  is this book, Blood Lines of the Illuminati? And he said, well, Jordan, anybody could have
[1:03:11.000 --> 1:03:15.280]  done that kind of research. Anybody could have done that. I said, yeah, anyone could
[1:03:15.280 --> 1:03:20.760]  have done it, but it was me that did it. And consequently, you know, now it's a big book
[1:03:20.760 --> 1:03:25.640]  out there, Blood Lines of the Illuminati, which Fritz Springmeyer got from Jordan Maxwell
[1:03:25.640 --> 1:03:31.280]  and never even said, thank you. I mean, I gave John Rappaport a job, but he didn't have
[1:03:31.280 --> 1:03:36.800]  a job and sat for hours with John Rappaport and told him about my work in San Diego when
[1:03:36.800 --> 1:03:42.040]  I brought him in and hired him to work with me. Later on, he creates a book called The
[1:03:42.040 --> 1:03:47.760]  Secret Behind Secrets of Zion. These are all my work. And of course, I work with Richard
[1:03:47.760 --> 1:03:53.600]  Hoglund and I sit in Zachariah, sitting around the world five times and I have met the company
[1:03:53.600 --> 1:03:59.080]  of truth seekers. I had a lot of, in Zachariah, the highest respect for a wonderful man. And
[1:03:59.080 --> 1:04:03.360]  the Richard Hoglund is still a great family of mine. But I've worked with so many people
[1:04:03.360 --> 1:04:09.760]  and then when I hear lecturers like Jim Mars and Tex Mars, especially Jim Mars, talking
[1:04:09.760 --> 1:04:15.160]  about Illuminati and secret societies, I think, hell, I was talking about that stuff back
[1:04:15.160 --> 1:04:19.280]  in 62. I was talking about that 45 years ago.
[1:04:19.280 --> 1:04:26.720]  But Jordan, that's also a sign of your success and Myron Fagans and others that we do want
[1:04:26.720 --> 1:04:34.640]  other people to go out and put the information out. But I could certainly see in a case where
[1:04:34.640 --> 1:04:37.560]  you think somebody went and got your material and then put it into a book and gave you no
[1:04:37.560 --> 1:04:45.400]  credit. That is bad. But, I mean, at the same time, well, hold on, we're going to continue
[1:04:45.400 --> 1:04:48.200]  on through this break for folks on the Internet talking and we'll come back for everybody
[1:04:48.200 --> 1:04:49.200]  else in a sec.
[1:04:49.200 --> 1:04:55.360]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war
[1:04:55.360 --> 1:04:56.840]  against this country.
[1:04:56.840 --> 1:05:00.680]  The enemy struck America on September 11th. But who is the enemy?
[1:05:00.680 --> 1:05:01.680]  Bin Laden.
[1:05:01.680 --> 1:05:02.680]  This is his MO.
[1:05:02.680 --> 1:05:06.280]  We have to look to the Middle East. We have to look to the Psalm of Bin Laden.
[1:05:06.280 --> 1:05:10.880]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence
[1:05:10.880 --> 1:05:13.480]  networks inside the United States.
[1:05:13.480 --> 1:05:17.360]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis, again, very much engaged in
[1:05:17.360 --> 1:05:20.120]  spying in and on the U.S.
[1:05:20.120 --> 1:05:23.640]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[1:05:23.640 --> 1:05:29.240]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers' ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection,
[1:05:29.240 --> 1:05:33.440]  the Israeli intelligence network, warnings in war games, the shadow government, and much,
[1:05:33.440 --> 1:05:39.560]  much more. Fabled Enemies. Get the DVD at infowars.com. Forsee it in super high quality,

[1:05:53.760 --> 1:05:56.800]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.

[1:07:49.800 --> 1:07:53.160]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[1:07:53.160 --> 1:07:56.760]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[1:07:56.760 --> 1:08:06.960]  Okay, to be clear, Jordan has always been a very magnanimous, very friendly, very helping,
[1:08:06.960 --> 1:08:08.960]  generous person.
[1:08:08.960 --> 1:08:11.240]  And I talked to him on an offer.
[1:08:11.240 --> 1:08:16.160]  His main point is, and I like you said in your own words, is that it's not that only
[1:08:16.160 --> 1:08:20.400]  that people take a lot of his work and don't give him credit, it's that he then gets emails
[1:08:20.400 --> 1:08:25.840]  and posts about, oh, this person came out with this and Jordan took it.
[1:08:25.840 --> 1:08:30.320]  And I think that's, and then people start fights up between people and I was just talking
[1:08:30.320 --> 1:08:31.320]  to Jordan.
[1:08:31.320 --> 1:08:33.560]  He's saying he won't be doing very many interviews in the future.
[1:08:33.560 --> 1:08:35.120]  It was hard to even get Jordan on.
[1:08:35.120 --> 1:08:36.120]  We called him a few months ago.
[1:08:36.120 --> 1:08:39.600]  He said he wasn't doing interviews anymore and then later he called back and said, okay,
[1:08:39.600 --> 1:08:41.760]  I'll come on, which we're very thankful for.
[1:08:41.760 --> 1:08:42.760]  He is ill.
[1:08:42.760 --> 1:08:43.760]  He needs our support.
[1:08:43.760 --> 1:08:45.160]  He needs our financial support.
[1:08:45.160 --> 1:08:46.160]  He deserves that.
[1:08:46.160 --> 1:08:49.320]  And we'll tell you how to get some of his books and videos before he leaves us there
[1:08:49.320 --> 1:08:50.320]  all at jordanmaxwell.com.
[1:08:50.320 --> 1:08:52.520]  I mean, there you go, but we'll talk more about them.
[1:08:52.520 --> 1:08:57.720]  But I mean, let's walk through that specifically on your own words.
[1:08:57.720 --> 1:09:00.960]  You were telling me during the last a little behind the scenes interview we were doing
[1:09:00.960 --> 1:09:07.080]  for the prisonplanet.tv viewers that yes, that people make these fights up.
[1:09:07.080 --> 1:09:12.560]  I think it is people in the government disinfo to get researchers fighting where people will
[1:09:12.560 --> 1:09:16.640]  then say, Jordan Maxwell took this guy's research and you're laughing because you were around
[1:09:16.640 --> 1:09:19.400]  40 years before they even showed up.
[1:09:19.400 --> 1:09:24.040]  You were around before I was a zygote in my mother's womb.
[1:09:24.040 --> 1:09:31.040]  You were doing this 40 years before other people popped up on the scene.
[1:09:31.040 --> 1:09:35.680]  I've said that even in two audiences that some of the people that are out there talking
[1:09:35.680 --> 1:09:44.480]  today about this subject of secret societies, the Illuminati, Bible codes, Knights Templars,
[1:09:44.480 --> 1:09:46.640]  international banking, all of that stuff.
[1:09:46.640 --> 1:09:50.760]  I was talking about back in the 60s, early 60s, 62.
[1:09:50.760 --> 1:09:56.760]  Like I said at the beginning, I used to send a lot of articles to the Burt's Society way
[1:09:56.760 --> 1:09:59.360]  back in 6061.
[1:09:59.360 --> 1:10:06.480]  I was giving a lecture in downtown Hollywood, in East Hollywood, to a Christian group the
[1:10:06.480 --> 1:10:09.520]  day that John Kennedy was assassinated.
[1:10:09.520 --> 1:10:18.000]  I was giving a lecture in downtown Hollywood on secret societies and occult religions in
[1:10:18.000 --> 1:10:21.360]  1963 when Kennedy was assassinated.
[1:10:21.360 --> 1:10:24.200]  I've been talking about this stuff for 48 years.
[1:10:24.200 --> 1:10:29.040]  Well we owe a debt to you, let's briefly talk about some of the shoulders that you and others
[1:10:29.040 --> 1:10:30.040]  stand on.
[1:10:30.040 --> 1:10:34.840]  So that we can stand on yours in this fight against tyranny and lies and fraud and dehumanization
[1:10:34.840 --> 1:10:35.840]  and greed and control.
[1:10:35.840 --> 1:10:40.680]  You were saying Myron Fagan, what about Eustace Mullins, I mean his work on the Federal Reserve,
[1:10:40.680 --> 1:10:43.600]  he really was the guy helping get the book.
[1:10:43.600 --> 1:10:44.600]  Oh yeah.
[1:10:44.600 --> 1:10:45.600]  Oh yeah.
[1:10:45.600 --> 1:10:51.600]  Eustace Mullins did tremendous research for days and weeks and months writing and has
[1:10:51.600 --> 1:10:53.120]  paid the price for it.
[1:10:53.120 --> 1:10:54.120]  Has repelled.
[1:10:54.120 --> 1:10:55.120]  I mean he helped get it.
[1:10:55.120 --> 1:10:58.640]  And has repelled, absolutely, and many before that.
[1:10:58.640 --> 1:11:04.000]  So and I've always said, and I'm famous for saying that, that I'm not the world's foremost
[1:11:04.000 --> 1:11:10.400]  authority on anything, I'm just an ordinary man interested in extraordinary knowledge.
[1:11:10.400 --> 1:11:14.800]  Well I think the key here is though you codified so much evidence, before you came along you'd
[1:11:14.800 --> 1:11:20.040]  have to go read 100 high level Masonic books, you'd have to go to the libraries, look at
[1:11:20.040 --> 1:11:21.760]  the real meanings of God's.
[1:11:21.760 --> 1:11:27.280]  So what you did is that knowledge was there, but that was kind of their internal knowledge
[1:11:27.280 --> 1:11:32.080]  and so you did bring to the world so much of what's going on today.
[1:11:32.080 --> 1:11:37.760]  I've seen online people trying to create a controversy between you and David Ike.
[1:11:37.760 --> 1:11:42.440]  Tell me, I mean just to set the record straight, people try to stir up stuff between you guys,
[1:11:42.440 --> 1:11:43.440]  let's set the record straight.
[1:11:43.440 --> 1:11:44.440]  What's really happening there?
[1:11:44.440 --> 1:11:49.240]  Well I appreciate that because I've been wanting to talk about this for a long time because
[1:11:49.240 --> 1:11:53.880]  there is a lot, I get a lot of emails and phone calls about, well you said this about
[1:11:53.880 --> 1:11:56.640]  David Ike or David Ike said that.
[1:11:56.640 --> 1:12:01.800]  First of all, I don't have any problems with anything David Ike is talking about.
[1:12:01.800 --> 1:12:08.240]  As a matter of fact, I gave him a lot and he's gotten a lot from me, but I did in point
[1:12:08.240 --> 1:12:13.120]  of fact myself in 1992, I brought David Ike to America.
[1:12:13.120 --> 1:12:19.240]  I'm the one that brought him here and I was in San Diego at the time and a young lady
[1:12:19.240 --> 1:12:27.960]  named Alice Ferguson came to my office in San Diego with a man, a friend of hers named
[1:12:27.960 --> 1:12:32.040]  David Griffith and Alice Ferguson, David Griffith came to my office.
[1:12:32.040 --> 1:12:39.000]  I was pretty much running a company down in San Diego called Truthseeker Company and
[1:12:39.000 --> 1:12:44.840]  she asked me if I would help bring her friend to America who was doing, who was very interested
[1:12:44.840 --> 1:12:48.720]  in all my work and he was trying to do the same thing in England.
[1:12:48.720 --> 1:12:53.000]  So I said well who is this person and so she said it's David Ike.
[1:12:53.000 --> 1:12:56.760]  So I listened to her for about an hour and we talked about it and I said all right I'll
[1:12:56.760 --> 1:13:02.520]  tell you what I'll do, I'll give both you and David Griffith a job, I'll pay both of
[1:13:02.520 --> 1:13:08.520]  you $2,500 a month and I'll get you because they didn't have a place to live, they were
[1:13:08.520 --> 1:13:12.640]  over here to promote David Ike and they didn't have a place to live, they were staying with
[1:13:12.640 --> 1:13:18.600]  some friends in San Diego so I got them both in apartment, I gave them both $3,000 a piece
[1:13:18.600 --> 1:13:24.840]  to buy furniture for their apartments, I gave them both a job for $2,500 a month plus they
[1:13:24.840 --> 1:13:34.720]  both had the credit cards for the foundation, the corporation and so I financed her, Alice
[1:13:34.720 --> 1:13:42.840]  Ferguson and ultimately David Ike to come to America, to go to Australia, to go to Canada
[1:13:42.840 --> 1:13:47.480]  and all of that cost money to fly all over the world and to set up lectures for David
[1:13:47.480 --> 1:13:56.320]  Ike and eventually Alice Ferguson talked with Bonnie Lange, the lady who was running the
[1:13:56.320 --> 1:14:01.000]  company and a couple of other women in the office and they decided that why don't we
[1:14:01.000 --> 1:14:06.360]  just fire Jordan Maxwell, get rid of him and bring David Ike in to take his place and so
[1:14:06.360 --> 1:14:12.080]  that's what happened, I got fired by the same people that I tried to help and bring David
[1:14:12.080 --> 1:14:18.320]  Ike to America, I got fired so that David could take my job but after they fired me
[1:14:18.320 --> 1:14:23.360]  they found out that David was not interested in sitting in an office running a company
[1:14:23.360 --> 1:14:28.920]  like Jordan Maxwell so then the company went downhill from there because I was gone and
[1:14:28.920 --> 1:14:34.200]  they had already fired me and David didn't want the job and so they just cut their nose
[1:14:34.200 --> 1:14:39.720]  off despite their face and so the truth secret company is now defunct and is no longer around
[1:14:39.720 --> 1:14:46.480]  and of course I, at that time I was helping because I had access to the corporation funds,
[1:14:46.480 --> 1:14:54.800]  I was helping Richard Hoglund, Zachariah Sitchin, as I said John Rappaport had no job, I called
[1:14:54.800 --> 1:15:01.400]  John Rappaport, gave him a job, got him started again and he went out and wrote a book on
[1:15:01.400 --> 1:15:09.600]  my work called Secret Behind the Secret Societies so of course I don't know if we were on the
[1:15:09.600 --> 1:15:14.800]  air at the time when we were talking about the Fritz Springmeyer with the bloodlines
[1:15:14.800 --> 1:15:20.680]  of the Illuminati but all of that was taken from me back in 1988 by Fritz Springmeyer's
[1:15:20.680 --> 1:15:27.000]  girlfriend Gloria Mascarella so all of these people that I have you know and of course
[1:15:27.000 --> 1:15:33.320]  I was giving lectures in the motion picture studios and all the different recording studios
[1:15:33.320 --> 1:15:40.840]  back in the 70s and 80s I was going around to motion picture studios at night and just
[1:15:40.840 --> 1:15:44.320]  the working class people in the studios would get me a pass to get here.
[1:15:44.320 --> 1:15:49.480]  Yeah I know some say that they took the idea for the Matrix from you, is that true?
[1:15:49.480 --> 1:15:57.240]  Well I had a video called Matrix of Power about ten years before the movie Matrix came
[1:15:57.240 --> 1:16:02.760]  out but I don't think that they, maybe they might have been influenced by the Matrix because
[1:16:02.760 --> 1:16:08.800]  it was a big seller when it came out one never knows but what I do know is that there's
[1:16:08.800 --> 1:16:16.360]  that directly from my video with one of my first videos ever done was called the basic
[1:16:16.360 --> 1:16:21.400]  slide presentation and if you get my basic slide presentation that's the one that may
[1:16:21.400 --> 1:16:28.920]  be famous all over the world and it was a two hour video out of that at the very beginning
[1:16:28.920 --> 1:16:35.960]  of the basic slide presentation and get that and watch it and then get the movie Da Vinci
[1:16:35.960 --> 1:16:43.360]  Code and it is exactly word for word exactly in the Da Vinci Code at the beginning of the
[1:16:43.360 --> 1:16:51.240]  movie they introduce Tom Hanks as a world foremost researcher in occult societies and
[1:16:51.240 --> 1:16:58.760]  secret societies and he comes up on the stage this is in the movie Da Vinci Code and he
[1:16:58.760 --> 1:17:05.080]  comes up on the stage and he's got a screen and a slide projector and on the screen being
[1:17:05.080 --> 1:17:10.520]  projected on the screen is the symbol on the back of the dollar bill with the pyramid and
[1:17:10.520 --> 1:17:17.000]  he walks in front of the projection so some of it is being projected on him and he's
[1:17:17.000 --> 1:17:22.640]  now pointing to the pyramid the all seeing eye etc and talking about the Illuminati and
[1:17:22.640 --> 1:17:30.120]  secret societies on the dollar bill etc that came directly out of my basic slide presentation
[1:17:30.120 --> 1:17:37.720]  period, period it came directly out of my video and nobody ever called me to send me
[1:17:37.720 --> 1:17:42.720]  a check Da Vinci Code of course the whole idea of Da Vinci Code was a rip off of Baygent
[1:17:42.720 --> 1:17:49.680]  Leon Lincoln the entire movie Da Vinci Code was a absolute rip off of the British writers
[1:17:49.680 --> 1:17:56.120]  of Baygent Leon Lincoln and their book that appeared about 15 years before the movie called
[1:17:56.120 --> 1:18:02.880]  Holy Blood Holy Grail and so the producers of Da Vinci Code ripped off Baygent Leon
[1:18:02.880 --> 1:18:11.560]  Lincoln's book Holy Blood Holy Grail and made it into a movie and act like they came
[1:18:11.560 --> 1:18:16.480]  up with something new and there was a lawsuit in England because of that so I'm not the
[1:18:16.480 --> 1:18:20.800]  only one that's been ripped off and lied to and cheated and left for dead there's a lot
[1:18:20.800 --> 1:18:21.800]  of good people.
[1:18:21.800 --> 1:18:26.360]  Well it's just you've made such a contribution to fighting the New World Lord Jordan that
[1:18:26.360 --> 1:18:31.400]  I don't normally even air laundry on the show but it's important that you be recognized
[1:18:31.400 --> 1:18:36.080]  for the work you've done and so people appreciate the work you've done now I want to shift gears
[1:18:36.080 --> 1:18:40.680]  for the rest of this hour into the biggest secrets the biggest issues you know what makes

[1:18:46.800 --> 1:18:53.360]  okay then then let me say then if you if you're up for that just remember that when you ask
[1:18:53.360 --> 1:18:59.600]  for something you know make sure you're ready for it because you know make sure what you
[1:18:59.600 --> 1:19:03.880]  ask for you're ready for because it might be something that you weren't expecting well
[1:19:03.880 --> 1:19:08.480]  I don't I don't entirely I'm I understand your information I've read it looked at it
[1:19:08.480 --> 1:19:13.600]  covered it and I understand it all has a basis in fact and you believe your interpretation
[1:19:13.600 --> 1:19:18.400]  is correct but the nuance is sometimes I watch one thing you do it's different another it's
[1:19:18.400 --> 1:19:22.400]  a little different but I'm not saying you change your views I'm saying it's nuanced
[1:19:22.400 --> 1:19:26.840]  so we're not this show you can talk about anything you want only person that controls

[1:24:25.000 --> 1:24:30.320]  i don't really want to get into the political part of this because we don't have a whole
[1:24:30.320 --> 1:24:37.480]  lot of time left and besides everyone who needs to know already knows how bad off we
[1:24:37.480 --> 1:24:42.160]  are i'd like to talk about some subjects that maybe we don't know but i do want to get
[1:24:42.160 --> 1:24:46.960]  your take on what their final master plan is and i know what your view is but but but
[1:24:46.960 --> 1:24:51.640]  also i want to get your latest take your latest analysis on what their end game is but but
[1:24:51.640 --> 1:24:57.320]  but but sure go ahead and start at the beginning okay well then everybody should get a piece
[1:24:57.320 --> 1:25:02.360]  of paper and pencil and write down a couple words i'm going to give you because i believe
[1:25:02.360 --> 1:25:08.840]  these are key words to open up a can of worms that you will not believe it's going to open
[1:25:08.840 --> 1:25:16.800]  up a whole world of research to you that you've never known existed the first word is hunciotic
[1:25:16.800 --> 1:25:27.960]  league spell h a n s e a t i c hunciotic league it's on my website if you go to my
[1:25:27.960 --> 1:25:34.160]  website and go to the research department it goes to the research you will see a box
[1:25:34.160 --> 1:25:40.240]  saying words to research go on the words to research and check down into the ages and
[1:25:40.240 --> 1:25:47.160]  you'll see hunciotic league the hunciotic league is extremely important to the illuminati
[1:25:47.160 --> 1:25:53.200]  story today and connected to the hunciotic league which most people don't even know
[1:25:53.200 --> 1:26:02.920]  exist is something called and write it down to tonic zionism it is not semenic jewish
[1:26:02.920 --> 1:26:12.520]  zionism no the word is two tonic t e u t o n i c the two tonic nights are the german
[1:26:12.520 --> 1:26:17.480]  branch of the two of the night's templates that's right that's the name of the two of
[1:26:17.480 --> 1:26:25.680]  the two tonic zionism it's a whole secret order that has been in operation for a thousand
[1:26:25.680 --> 1:26:33.560]  years it is the whole story behind america england and those things which are going on
[1:26:33.560 --> 1:26:39.440]  on the earth today and if you don't understand hunciotic league and two tonic zionism you're
[1:26:39.440 --> 1:26:44.880]  never going to figure out the name of the tune and how this thing is being played and
[1:26:44.880 --> 1:26:49.960]  i've been looking at this for forty eight years and i'm telling you that unless and
[1:26:49.960 --> 1:26:55.640]  until you have the whole story you're not going to get to the bottom of anything because
[1:26:55.640 --> 1:27:00.600]  like i said in the beginning the first hour your decisions in life are only as good as
[1:27:00.600 --> 1:27:06.640]  your information and the really extraordinary information has never been allowed to be given
[1:27:06.640 --> 1:27:13.360]  to the people so i'm just getting you started into a truly arcane occult research well on
[1:27:13.360 --> 1:27:17.440]  the two tonic nights that really grew into the tumblers and vice versa that's right after
[1:27:17.440 --> 1:27:21.080]  they knocked out the tumblers there was two tonic nights i only know about the two tonic
[1:27:21.080 --> 1:27:26.640]  nights because i read mine comp i read other books about the nazis and hitler thought that
[1:27:26.640 --> 1:27:32.920]  he was creating the recreated two tonic nights we know the british follow that that's right
[1:27:32.920 --> 1:27:36.720]  and again this goes back to them believing they're the seed of jesus they're the god
[1:27:36.720 --> 1:27:41.440]  race now you're getting that that's exactly right and and and and so that's what people
[1:27:41.440 --> 1:27:48.400]  can't get why the political zionist who were supposedly jewish were funding hitler why
[1:27:48.400 --> 1:27:53.960]  hitler allowed jews to leave to israel but nowhere else uh... why at the highest levels
[1:27:53.960 --> 1:27:59.640]  you'll have zionist right next to top nazis at bill berg and it's right i've said when
[1:27:59.640 --> 1:28:05.760]  you kick in that final door it's a room full of nazis and cabalist that's right that's
[1:28:05.760 --> 1:28:09.920]  exactly what i'm saying and then that's why i'm saying you better go back and that's
[1:28:09.920 --> 1:28:14.600]  what steven spielberg is telling us in writers the lost ark is trying to tell you something
[1:28:14.600 --> 1:28:20.160]  twice the nazis three times the last one the nazis are in it and the and the first two
[1:28:20.160 --> 1:28:25.520]  times the nazis are looking for the lost ark of the covenant why would the nazis care a
[1:28:25.520 --> 1:28:32.440]  damn about a jewish symbol of the of the covenant all the of the uh... the covenant of the
[1:28:32.440 --> 1:28:37.840]  who the lost ark of the covenant why would not be scared about the lost ark of the covenant
[1:28:37.840 --> 1:28:44.760]  a Jewish symbol. Why would they care about the Christian symbol of the Holy Grail?
[1:28:44.760 --> 1:28:53.440]  The second one, the last crusade. Why is he putting so much emphasis on the Knights Templars,
[1:28:53.440 --> 1:29:02.520]  the Masonic Knights' orders of the Teutonic Knights? They're trying to tell you something.
[1:29:02.520 --> 1:29:07.040]  So I'm saying, I've been looking at this for a long time and I'll tell you what the
[1:29:07.040 --> 1:29:16.280]  story is. Hanseatic League, Teutonic Zionism has nothing to do with Jewish Zionism out
[1:29:16.280 --> 1:29:23.640]  of the Bible, period. Nothing Jewish about it. It has to do with a very ancient, prehistoric
[1:29:23.640 --> 1:29:31.280]  ancient concept of a totalitarian dictatorship. As a matter of fact, if you go to any good
[1:29:31.280 --> 1:29:40.200]  law dictionary and look up the word FOS, F-A-S, FOS. FOS is a Latin word which means God.
[1:29:40.200 --> 1:29:50.120]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[1:29:50.120 --> 1:29:55.360]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war
[1:29:55.360 --> 1:30:00.760]  against this country. The enemy struck America on September 11th. But who is the enemy?
[1:30:00.760 --> 1:30:05.160]  bin Laden. This is his MO. We have to look to the Middle East. We have to look to Osama
[1:30:05.160 --> 1:30:09.880]  bin Laden. Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist
[1:30:09.880 --> 1:30:14.840]  ties to intelligence networks inside the United States. Some U.S. investigators believe that
[1:30:14.840 --> 1:30:21.120]  there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S. I'm aware that
[1:30:21.120 --> 1:30:26.400]  some Israeli citizens have been detained. Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers
[1:30:26.400 --> 1:30:31.120]  ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings
[1:30:31.120 --> 1:30:36.200]  in war games, the shadow government and much, much more. Fabled enemies. Get the DVD at

[1:31:52.760 --> 1:31:57.560]  factors in maintaining high energy and vibrant health? Most experts agree that the water you
[1:31:57.560 --> 1:32:03.720]  drink should be at a pH level of 9 or higher. Plasma pH drops combine a unique formula of
[1:32:03.720 --> 1:32:08.520]  the most alkaline minerals and elements. This product is a one of a kind in its strength
[1:32:08.520 --> 1:32:14.560]  and effectiveness. Using plasma pH drops is one of the best ways to make your water alkaline

[1:33:18.920 --> 1:33:23.520]  We're going to continue into the next hour special overdrive. Then when the retransmission
[1:33:23.520 --> 1:33:28.360]  continues, I'll get into Barry Jennings, deputy head of emergency management, New York talking
[1:33:28.360 --> 1:33:33.520]  about explosions in the building's dead bodies. In building seven before either tower collapse,
[1:33:33.520 --> 1:33:39.240]  destroying the 9-11 commission report. Huge video up on infowars.com and prisonplanet.com
[1:33:39.240 --> 1:33:46.240]  right now.
[1:33:46.440 --> 1:33:51.960]  The Supreme Court is set to rule that there is no second amendment today. But in lawyer
[1:33:51.960 --> 1:33:56.280]  speak they're going to say it's a victory for the second amendment. They're not allowed
[1:33:56.280 --> 1:34:01.120]  to totally ban guns in D.C. Now they have to go back and pass a new law that just basically
[1:34:01.120 --> 1:34:05.080]  restricts them to nothing but it has to be done by law. That's what they're going to
[1:34:05.080 --> 1:34:08.040]  do. They've already said they're going to do it and you're going to watch them do it
[1:34:08.040 --> 1:34:12.680]  and that way it neutralizes people. It's all about deception, all about word games. They
[1:34:12.680 --> 1:34:17.240]  play so many. They've trained whole cadres of people, compartmentalized to carry out
[1:34:17.240 --> 1:34:21.200]  the lies, but they don't see the larger part of how they're destroying themselves. We'll
[1:34:21.200 --> 1:34:26.920]  be back with Jordan Maxwell in just one moment. Be sure to visit his website, jordanmaxwell.com.
[1:34:26.920 --> 1:34:30.000]  And let's just go 30 more minutes into the next hour. He says he's feeling good and can
[1:34:30.000 --> 1:34:33.760]  do it. And we're going to be taking your phone calls coming up in the next hour, but not
[1:34:33.760 --> 1:34:38.400]  yet. We'll get that number out at the end of the main radio broadcast. It'll be internet
[1:34:38.400 --> 1:34:44.200]  only for the last 30 minutes with Jordan Maxwell. Before we go back to Jordan, this show is

[1:35:09.080 --> 1:35:13.280]  than 10 years in climate control, 10 years non-climate controlled, and it stores in
[1:35:13.280 --> 1:35:19.480]  very small areas. Each can is very heavy. It's jam-packed, very inexpensive. And with
[1:35:19.480 --> 1:35:24.440]  all the food price increases, the talk of depression, it's just good insurance to have
[1:35:24.440 --> 1:35:29.000]  storeable food. I do. I bought from several other companies. Didn't really like them.
[1:35:29.000 --> 1:35:32.840]  Bought from these guys, liked them six, seven years ago. Bought from them four times, bought
[1:35:32.840 --> 1:35:42.720]  family food, and done a lot more. So 1-800-409-5633, 1-800-409-5633 or eFoodsDirect.com, Big Fat

[1:36:49.840 --> 1:36:58.680]  Okay. Going back to Jordan Maxwell. He was talking about the Teutonic Zionist. And again
[1:36:58.680 --> 1:37:03.800]  separately from Jordan Maxwell, because I've been a big reader, I can confirm what he's
[1:37:03.800 --> 1:37:08.760]  saying because I happen to read Heinz Hobel, Order of the Deathshead, Shears, Rise and
[1:37:08.760 --> 1:37:15.480]  Fall of the Third Reich, two of Hitler's books, Mein Kampf and then the New World Order. I
[1:37:15.480 --> 1:37:20.600]  happen to know that they believe the Teutonic Knights, this predates the Templars. Mainstream
[1:37:20.600 --> 1:37:25.560]  history teaches you the Templars became the Teutonics, but really they were the tree from
[1:37:25.560 --> 1:37:31.040]  which the Templars rose. And when that tree was cut down and ran to Northern England or
[1:37:31.040 --> 1:37:36.640]  to Scotland, the real heart of it grew back up. Am I correct in saying that, Jordan? Yeah,
[1:37:36.640 --> 1:37:40.960]  I think you're right. I think you're right because the Teutonic thing goes way back into
[1:37:40.960 --> 1:37:48.760]  ancient history, way back. Yeah, that's a whole study in itself. That's why I said,
[1:37:48.760 --> 1:37:56.360]  I'll put the two together, the Teutonic Zionism, which is Semitic Zionism. It's Teutonic
[1:37:56.360 --> 1:38:06.000]  Zionism and Hanseatic League. And again, the word is H-A-N-S-E-A-T-I-C. Hanseatic League
[1:38:06.000 --> 1:38:10.800]  and Teutonic Zionism will begin to open up a can of worms that you're not going to
[1:38:10.800 --> 1:38:17.920]  believe. Well, tell us about the Hanseatic League. Well, as a League of German bankers
[1:38:17.920 --> 1:38:25.760]  and thinkers, philosophers, but especially bankers and commercial enterprises in Germany
[1:38:25.760 --> 1:38:31.680]  under the Second Reich, which was under Kaiser Wilhelm, and even way before that, before
[1:38:31.680 --> 1:38:39.120]  the German nation came to be a nation. So it's a whole confederation of bankers, thinkers,
[1:38:39.120 --> 1:38:44.400]  philosophers who were basically... They created the modern education system. They created
[1:38:44.400 --> 1:38:49.960]  the PhD. That's it. You got it. They engineered the whole society. They created NASA. They
[1:38:49.960 --> 1:38:56.960]  created our CIA. They merged with the British German aristocracy. And again, I'm not absolving
[1:38:56.960 --> 1:39:01.640]  the modern corrupt murderous Zionists. The point is, I have found that they are actually
[1:39:01.640 --> 1:39:07.440]  their plaything and that they are married in with the Rothschilds. And every time I
[1:39:07.440 --> 1:39:12.880]  knock down that final door, this is a Germanic death cult that believes they are the true
[1:39:12.880 --> 1:39:13.880]  Zionist.
[1:39:13.880 --> 1:39:17.600]  That's it. That's the name of the tune and you said it all. That's it. So let's move
[1:39:17.600 --> 1:39:18.600]  on because...
[1:39:18.600 --> 1:39:23.800]  But I mean, all I try to do, though, is report what I really find in history. And I mean,
[1:39:23.800 --> 1:39:28.040]  look at who owns the big pharma companies. Look at who owns the military. And then it's
[1:39:28.040 --> 1:39:31.440]  got to be a debate about the Catholics or it's got to be a debate about the... But then the
[1:39:31.440 --> 1:39:36.960]  Catholic system is trying to set up the new Rome and it's hooked in with the Teutonics.
[1:39:36.960 --> 1:39:37.960]  Is it not?
[1:39:37.960 --> 1:39:38.960]  Of course it is.
[1:39:38.960 --> 1:39:39.960]  Of course it is.
[1:39:39.960 --> 1:39:44.480]  But then I say it's only part of it. I mean, I'm saying Zionists, Catholics, all of it,
[1:39:44.480 --> 1:39:49.640]  the Protestants. But see, no, they want to keep us compartmentalized, divided and conquer,
[1:39:49.640 --> 1:39:50.640]  don't they?
[1:39:50.640 --> 1:39:55.640]  You're right. You're right. That's why I was saying earlier, when you go on my website,
[1:39:55.640 --> 1:40:00.560]  there are three books that are showing. I have other e-books that... Once you hit one
[1:40:00.560 --> 1:40:06.120]  of the books that are showing, it will take you to the whole e-book section. But the one
[1:40:06.120 --> 1:40:11.880]  in the middle is called Symbol Sex and the Stars, which I was so taken by when I first
[1:40:11.880 --> 1:40:18.120]  found this book in an old book store, I was just absolutely mesmerized by how much information
[1:40:18.120 --> 1:40:26.560]  is in there so well easily to read and explain about where things come from and the world
[1:40:26.560 --> 1:40:33.320]  theology, where it developed, what the words meant, the etymology of the words and where
[1:40:33.320 --> 1:40:39.720]  the concepts and ideas have come from. It's called Symbol Sex and the Stars. I own the
[1:40:39.720 --> 1:40:44.440]  copyright on that. I gave it to my friend so he could publish it. And then the second
[1:40:44.440 --> 1:40:53.240]  one, which was so extraordinarily important, I asked and got the copyright to own it. Also,
[1:40:53.240 --> 1:40:58.040]  I not only loved the books, I wanted to own them so I could put them out all over the
[1:40:58.040 --> 1:41:06.080]  world. It's called Stellar Theology and Masonic Astronomy. And once you understand how Masonic
[1:41:06.080 --> 1:41:13.600]  Astronomy and is connected to the Stellar Theology of the ancient world, then all of
[1:41:13.600 --> 1:41:19.280]  the words and terms you're hearing in religion and philosophy and astronomy all begin to make
[1:41:19.280 --> 1:41:25.840]  sense. And that's why the Olympics this year are going to be on 888 and 888 in the day.
[1:41:25.840 --> 1:41:32.120]  That's why NASA did the shoots on certain days at certain times, admittedly occultic.
[1:41:32.120 --> 1:41:36.520]  That's why Ronald Reagan only gave speeches in an exact second on an exact day with a
[1:41:36.520 --> 1:41:41.320]  certain color tie looking a certain direction and would walk out and hail his arms in an
[1:41:41.320 --> 1:41:45.560]  occultic fashion before he did it. That's why Bill Clinton's upset. They really believe
[1:41:45.560 --> 1:41:50.160]  this and they believe it by extension all the power they have. They believe it's real
[1:41:50.160 --> 1:41:52.480]  and they believe they're communing with entities, don't they?
[1:41:52.480 --> 1:41:58.600]  That's exactly right. And the mere fact, I mean by their fruits you shall know them.
[1:41:58.600 --> 1:42:04.480]  The mere fact that they are the power tells you that there very well might be something
[1:42:04.480 --> 1:42:12.520]  in fact legitimate about it. That there very well might be an occult hidden dark force in
[1:42:12.520 --> 1:42:21.760]  the universe that we call the occult magical system that we put into movies like Matrix.
[1:42:21.760 --> 1:42:29.840]  But there is in point of fact a legitimate du jour real magical system operating on the
[1:42:29.840 --> 1:42:30.840]  earth.
[1:42:30.840 --> 1:42:36.480]  Now let's be clear for atheists out there, if you go research your atheistic founders
[1:42:36.480 --> 1:42:43.000]  you will find they're funded by occultic and theophics, different societies and that the
[1:42:43.000 --> 1:42:48.840]  world leaders who are telling you not to believe anything, they are obsessed with this, aren't
[1:42:48.840 --> 1:42:49.840]  they?
[1:42:49.840 --> 1:42:58.840]  No doubt about it. And Washington D.C. is just filled with occult symbolism, everywhere.
[1:42:58.840 --> 1:43:03.960]  We go to the Washington Monument and you know how many people go to the Washington Monument
[1:43:03.960 --> 1:43:09.440]  and see the Washington Monument and are so proud to stand there and have a picture taken
[1:43:09.440 --> 1:43:14.840]  in the Washington Monument, never realizing that the Washington Monument is a phallic
[1:43:14.840 --> 1:43:20.400]  symbol for the phallic worship in Egypt or all these Baptist churches. I mean you'll
[1:43:20.400 --> 1:43:23.680]  tell a Baptist preacher that and he'll giggle and laugh and wink at you because most of
[1:43:23.680 --> 1:43:24.680]  them are masons.
[1:43:24.680 --> 1:43:25.680]  That's right.
[1:43:25.680 --> 1:43:28.200]  I mean they know, it's funny to them.
[1:43:28.200 --> 1:43:35.080]  Look at, I've had so many people contact me, emails and phone asking me well what about
[1:43:35.080 --> 1:43:38.960]  this and what can you tell me about that? Well I'm just one man, I can't talk to the whole
[1:43:38.960 --> 1:43:46.200]  world one man at a time, but when people call me and ask me, I tell them, look at, I've
[1:43:46.200 --> 1:43:52.160]  found a website for 15 years. I've had stuff on that one subject you just asked me about
[1:43:52.160 --> 1:43:59.600]  and my research department, did you go to the research boxes on my website? No. Or did
[1:43:59.600 --> 1:44:06.840]  you go to the links on my website? No. Did you see the pictures and the downloadable
[1:44:06.840 --> 1:44:12.200]  documents? No. Well did you get any of the e-books that were there? No, I didn't see
[1:44:12.200 --> 1:44:19.800]  any e-books. So I want to take this opportunity to say, anyone who goes on my website, understand
[1:44:19.800 --> 1:44:27.080]  there is at least 48 years of knowledge and work that I have put into my website of stuff
[1:44:27.080 --> 1:44:33.320]  that you will never be privy to know even exist. So when you go to my website, don't
[1:44:33.320 --> 1:44:38.400]  just look at the home page and up a couple of pictures, go all through it and especially
[1:44:38.400 --> 1:44:45.040]  on the audio video page and the links page, I've got stuff on links pages, I don't put
[1:44:45.040 --> 1:44:50.680]  links on my website to take up room, I put them on because they are very important to
[1:44:50.680 --> 1:44:56.120]  me. Now Jordan, I want to move quickly here. You also told me privately that you may not
[1:44:56.120 --> 1:45:01.040]  be doing radio much longer, two Sundays from now, you're going to be joining us for the
[1:45:01.040 --> 1:45:07.440]  full two hours and if you really are talking about hanging up your hat here, I want to
[1:45:07.440 --> 1:45:10.960]  get you up even sooner back on this show. I mean you say you're ill, you don't feel
[1:45:10.960 --> 1:45:16.200]  well, you're losing the drive but I hear that drive reigniting once we get you on air. Any
[1:45:16.200 --> 1:45:22.520]  ballpark on when you may hang it up? I get excited in my spirit when I'm in the company
[1:45:22.520 --> 1:45:30.880]  of someone like yourself, Alex, that appreciates the work and appreciates the time and the
[1:45:30.880 --> 1:45:38.320]  effort and all that comes with it because I have become so despondent and so dejected
[1:45:38.320 --> 1:45:45.280]  over all the years of seeing things people are saying about me which are not true, they're
[1:45:45.280 --> 1:45:49.960]  saying that I'm an enemy of so-and-so. You shouldn't let them get to you, they're mad
[1:45:49.960 --> 1:45:54.200]  but you're getting flat because you're over the target, Jordan and people are jealous
[1:45:54.200 --> 1:45:58.720]  of you, they try to start up fights, you need to know you've done a lot of great work, you're
[1:45:58.720 --> 1:46:02.400]  still doing great work and if they know they're getting to you, they're only going to go ten
[1:46:02.400 --> 1:46:06.440]  times crazier and look I got people threatening me and threatening my family and I know it's
[1:46:06.440 --> 1:46:09.600]  happened to you and you got people banging on your doors and they're going to kill you
[1:46:09.600 --> 1:46:13.200]  and the cops won't help you. I understand all that's happened, that's why we've got
[1:46:13.200 --> 1:46:18.160]  you here to try to get you support but don't let them get you down, I mean I know you're
[1:46:18.160 --> 1:46:22.680]  70-something years old and got cancer so it's easy for me, you know, 30-something years
[1:46:22.680 --> 1:46:27.200]  younger to consider and say this but that's why we got you, you got rare books, important
[1:46:27.200 --> 1:46:31.960]  material, folks go buy us stuff at jordanmaxwell.com, Jordan I've known him for many years, interviewed
[1:46:31.960 --> 1:46:35.520]  him many times over the years, never heard him like this, I know he's in a bad spot,
[1:46:35.520 --> 1:46:40.160]  that's why we are trying to support him here but just from me to you brother, don't let
[1:46:40.160 --> 1:46:44.120]  him get you down man, you have done an incredible job.
[1:46:44.120 --> 1:46:50.240]  Well I'll tell you what really bothers me terrible, I mean I'll just tell you personally
[1:46:50.240 --> 1:46:56.640]  what really hurts me is the fact that I haven't even begun to tell the people who want to
[1:46:56.640 --> 1:47:00.240]  know, I haven't even begun to scrape the surface of what I really am.
[1:47:00.240 --> 1:47:03.880]  I know the frustration, I have the same feeling, there's 50 films I want to make, there's
[1:47:03.880 --> 1:47:08.680]  all these complex issues I want to expose and then I make a film like hand game that
[1:47:08.680 --> 1:47:13.840]  cost me $150,000 to make and people watched it and appreciated it but I know it hasn't
[1:47:13.840 --> 1:47:19.640]  gotten the attention it needs, this is life-saving information and people just kind of like oh
[1:47:19.640 --> 1:47:23.680]  you put it on the web for free, I don't even care to watch it, you know it's like you pour
[1:47:23.680 --> 1:47:28.280]  your guts out, you don't sleep making something, you go through hell to make it and they don't
[1:47:28.280 --> 1:47:31.680]  understand, it's pearls before swine sometimes.
[1:47:31.680 --> 1:47:35.720]  Absolutely and consequently but the powers that be know that you're putting it out and
[1:47:35.720 --> 1:47:39.800]  they're going to deal with you, you're going to have your family and threats against your
[1:47:39.800 --> 1:47:44.240]  life and threats against your home and you're dealing, you're fighting something on the
[1:47:44.240 --> 1:47:49.920]  front lines while other people are just viewing your work as entertainment.
[1:47:49.920 --> 1:47:55.520]  So many people will listen to me and watch videos which I've never put any of my videos.
[1:47:55.520 --> 1:47:59.560]  That's right, one of the biggest comic book companies has put on a whole line of comic
[1:47:59.560 --> 1:48:02.320]  books called New World Order and they are giving you credit, Jordan.
[1:48:02.320 --> 1:48:06.560]  You know I know, that comic book company did because I think they had to, lawfully they
[1:48:06.560 --> 1:48:14.800]  had to because it was based on me so but you know if you go on my website to the e-books,
[1:48:14.800 --> 1:48:18.720]  those three e-books are very, very important, that's why I put them on the home page and
[1:48:18.720 --> 1:48:24.080]  of course I have another box called endorsements and emails, a lot of interesting stuff on
[1:48:24.080 --> 1:48:29.400]  there that people have sent me and I just put it out in the public so let you see what
[1:48:29.400 --> 1:48:35.400]  other people have sent me, then downloadable documents, the photo gallery and of course
[1:48:35.400 --> 1:48:40.640]  just general research boxes, I've got tons of stuff on there but what really bothers
[1:48:40.640 --> 1:48:47.280]  me is that I would love to be able to do radio and talk to the world and tell the world
[1:48:47.280 --> 1:48:51.240]  what I really know and what I have never told.
[1:48:51.240 --> 1:48:56.000]  Why don't we have you back up later in the week for like two hours to really, you can
[1:48:56.000 --> 1:49:00.000]  say whatever you want here Jordan and it's a big audience, millions of people as you
[1:49:00.000 --> 1:49:03.720]  know but before we go to this final break for the main show and then call you back on
[1:49:03.720 --> 1:49:08.440]  my studio line for an internet cast where millions will see it in the next few months
[1:49:08.440 --> 1:49:14.200]  but tens of thousands listening and watching right now but I want to talk about two things
[1:49:14.200 --> 1:49:20.840]  before this main show ends in about eight minutes and that is this, A, how does their
[1:49:20.840 --> 1:49:25.360]  command and control structure work and we know it's a philosophy, it's a pyramid, it's
[1:49:25.360 --> 1:49:30.480]  different lower levels of compartmentalization, A, but I mean from a city up to the national
[1:49:30.480 --> 1:49:35.720]  level, international and then B, their master plan, if they're able to get everything they
[1:49:35.720 --> 1:49:40.680]  want built and done which it looks like they're able to do, what will it finally look like,
[1:49:40.680 --> 1:49:45.160]  when will they go ahead and wipe out 90% of us or what's the time frame on that, in fact
[1:49:45.160 --> 1:49:48.800]  let's cover that first and we're going to skip this break for infowars.com listeners.
[1:49:48.800 --> 1:49:51.200]  Okay, you want to talk about it now?
[1:49:51.200 --> 1:49:54.800]  Yeah, let's talk about their master plan if they win.
[1:49:54.800 --> 1:50:00.800]  Well, I think the human race and this is going to be painting with a very broad brush but
[1:50:00.800 --> 1:50:07.440]  it's based on many years of looking at the subject from every conceivable angle and I've
[1:50:07.440 --> 1:50:13.960]  traveled all around the world from Egypt to Europe to quite literally around the world
[1:50:13.960 --> 1:50:19.560]  talking to people, lecturing on this subject and I've learned so much from others in other
[1:50:19.560 --> 1:50:25.160]  areas of the world, it's very rewarding to travel and hear other foreign people what
[1:50:25.160 --> 1:50:31.040]  they think and see how things work in their country and I'm totally convinced that the
[1:50:31.040 --> 1:50:36.080]  human race is being mutated according to a scientific method.
[1:50:36.080 --> 1:50:44.320]  We know that there have been experiments done as far back as the 1920s and 30s of trying
[1:50:44.320 --> 1:50:51.440]  to cross breed animals with humans, the Germans were doing that.
[1:50:51.440 --> 1:50:55.080]  You know, I know exactly what you're thinking when it comes to this economy, the banks are
[1:50:55.080 --> 1:51:01.280]  crashing the stock markets a mess, there's the mortgage crisis, there's the lending crisis,
[1:51:01.280 --> 1:51:07.160]  there's the food and gasoline prices through the ceiling crisis and we're paralyzed a little
[1:51:07.160 --> 1:51:10.560]  bit, we don't know exactly how to respond to it, I don't know what to say, what can
[1:51:10.560 --> 1:51:14.120]  you do, do what you can do, that's what you do, you do what you can do, what I can do
[1:51:14.120 --> 1:51:17.800]  is I can put some food away, I know there's a global food shortage, I can read it, I can
[1:51:17.800 --> 1:51:22.520]  go to eFoodsDirect.com, read hundreds of articles about this, I can go up on the Google website
[1:51:22.520 --> 1:51:26.320]  and Google food shortage and see the world's a mess, I know it, you know it, look at the
[1:51:26.320 --> 1:51:30.000]  prices, look where they're headed, be prepared, take care of yourself, you owe your family,
[1:51:30.000 --> 1:51:34.320]  some security, some sense of self-being, a little bit of self-reliance is a good idea
[1:51:34.320 --> 1:51:38.920]  right now, get some food from eFoodsDirect.com, go up to eFoodsDirect.com right now, look
[1:51:38.920 --> 1:51:44.160]  hey, you don't even have to can your own food anymore, we canned it for you, that's 1-800-409-5633
[1:51:44.160 --> 1:51:48.640]  eFoodsDirect.com, 1-800-409-5633, call us now.
[1:51:48.640 --> 1:51:55.440]  May I have everyone's attention please, I've come with a message of information, 9-11 was
[1:51:55.440 --> 1:51:59.320]  an inside job, you like being a puppet sir, you like being a puppet from the New World
[1:51:59.320 --> 1:52:00.320]  Order.
[1:52:00.320 --> 1:52:04.280]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage, it was engineered by you, David
[1:52:04.280 --> 1:52:11.320]  Rockefeller, the fallout or commission, the C.A.F.R., the day that we stop asking questions
[1:52:11.320 --> 1:52:16.120]  is the day that we have allowed the seeds of despotism to grow at our own door.
[1:52:16.120 --> 1:52:21.320]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11, a global awakening has taken place.
[1:52:21.320 --> 1:52:25.320]  An inside job, how dare you.
[1:52:25.320 --> 1:52:32.320]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[1:52:32.320 --> 1:52:35.320]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[1:52:35.320 --> 1:52:39.920]  And if the government has not told the truth in 5 years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary
[1:52:39.920 --> 1:52:40.920]  of 9-11.

[1:54:19.760 --> 1:54:22.480]  And then lo and behold, I go to their own documents.
[1:54:22.480 --> 1:54:28.080]  They vitriolically say they're poisoning us, killing us, euthanizing us right now.
[1:54:28.080 --> 1:54:31.480]  With the nutrition we've been getting, we should be living to 130.
[1:54:31.480 --> 1:54:36.000]  They are waging war on us and I, you know, hadn't even got into Jordan Maxwell's own
[1:54:36.000 --> 1:54:38.640]  research on this and I say, what's the master plan?
[1:54:38.640 --> 1:54:43.360]  And he says to dumb us down into a new suboid species and you read the eugenicists, you
[1:54:43.360 --> 1:54:48.080]  read the government plans, they are now doing it, inserting us into a matrix, you're being
[1:54:48.080 --> 1:54:53.040]  sucked into your iPhone, sucked into your video games, you're already interfacing, you're
[1:54:53.040 --> 1:54:59.480]  already, I've got to have you up very soon, Jordan, to do a whole show on this and how
[1:54:59.480 --> 1:55:03.520]  they admit they're doing it and I've had a leadist tell me, Alex, you warned them and
[1:55:03.520 --> 1:55:05.400]  look, they don't even care.
[1:55:05.400 --> 1:55:06.600]  That's the ultimate cop out.
[1:55:06.600 --> 1:55:10.760]  They have done everything for generations to dumb us down and to turn us into this.
[1:55:10.760 --> 1:55:15.040]  The National Banking Association 100 years ago put out memo saying, buy up the media,
[1:55:15.040 --> 1:55:20.440]  dumb everybody down, they're reading too much, they're chemically attacking all of you.
[1:55:20.440 --> 1:55:25.560]  This is their own admissions and Jordan, we're going to call you back in just a moment on
[1:55:25.560 --> 1:55:29.720]  your line because we're going to end the show, the main show, we're going to do 30 more minutes
[1:55:29.720 --> 1:55:30.720]  with you.
[1:55:30.720 --> 1:55:34.440]  But in closing, I want to thank you for coming on the main show and I want to ask everybody
[1:55:34.440 --> 1:55:36.760]  to visit jordanmaxwell.com.
[1:55:36.760 --> 1:55:39.120]  Anything else in closing you want to say to the main audience?

[1:55:46.640 --> 1:55:51.520]  it may not be there tomorrow, so you better get whatever's on there because I'm always
[1:55:51.520 --> 1:55:57.360]  under attack, always, my website is being cut down, shut down, so I'm just saying go

[1:56:02.440 --> 1:56:03.680]  tomorrow's going to bring.

[1:56:07.200 --> 1:56:09.560]  Oh, I don't care, I couldn't care less.
[1:56:09.560 --> 1:56:14.280]  Okay, well we'll create a mirror and then point at it for you then and then all my visitors
[1:56:14.280 --> 1:56:16.760]  can come check out what you're doing and then get your books and videos.

[1:56:21.360 --> 1:56:24.920]  break and the phone will ring and we'll do 30 more minutes and take calls, okay?
[1:56:24.920 --> 1:56:26.600]  I told, okay, bye-bye.

[1:57:07.400 --> 1:57:09.640]  with Jordan Maxwell.
[1:57:09.640 --> 1:57:12.080]  People kept saying, get Jordan Maxwell on, I tried to get him on, he said he wasn't
[1:57:12.080 --> 1:57:14.480]  doing interviews anymore and then he graciously came on.
[1:57:14.480 --> 1:57:20.600]  So here he is, he's on and he'll be on more in the next few weeks with us.
[1:57:20.600 --> 1:57:26.360]  I do want to tell all of you that Truth Rising, the people taking action, waking up to 9-11,
[1:57:26.360 --> 1:57:28.280]  exposing that lie can expose the rest.

[1:58:40.200 --> 1:58:45.400]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war
[1:58:45.400 --> 1:58:46.920]  against this country.
[1:58:46.920 --> 1:58:51.080]  The enemy struck America on September 11th, but who is the enemy?
[1:58:51.080 --> 1:58:52.080]  Bin Laden.
[1:58:52.080 --> 1:58:53.080]  He sees his MOs.
[1:58:53.080 --> 1:58:56.280]  We have to look to the Middle East, we have to look to Osama bin Laden.
[1:58:56.280 --> 1:59:00.920]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence
[1:59:00.920 --> 1:59:03.520]  networks inside the United States.
[1:59:03.520 --> 1:59:07.960]  Some US investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying
[1:59:07.960 --> 1:59:10.160]  in and on the US.
[1:59:10.160 --> 1:59:13.760]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[1:59:13.760 --> 1:59:19.280]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers' ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection,
[1:59:19.280 --> 1:59:23.320]  the Israeli intelligence network, warnings in war games, the shadow government, and much
[1:59:23.320 --> 1:59:24.320]  much more.
[1:59:24.320 --> 1:59:25.320]  Fabled Enemies.

[2:01:04.520 --> 2:01:06.520]  and things that shrink the prostate.

[2:01:47.920 --> 2:01:48.920]  a day.

[2:01:55.960 --> 2:02:00.480]  of the air and that has no fluoride, none of the stuff they self-medicate you or forcibly

[2:02:08.880 --> 2:02:10.960]  By the way, they sold out of these and just got more in.
[2:02:10.960 --> 2:02:12.120]  We sold the company out.
[2:02:12.120 --> 2:02:13.120]  You did the listeners.
[2:02:13.120 --> 2:02:18.160]  866-585-4044, 1-866-585-4044, coloblue.com.
[2:02:18.160 --> 2:02:21.800]  Okay, Aaron, you've got about two, three minutes left.
[2:02:21.800 --> 2:02:23.440]  I want to go back to Aaron now.
[2:02:23.440 --> 2:02:25.480]  Aaron, finish up with your other points on eugenics.
[2:02:25.480 --> 2:02:30.680]  I was going to rapid-fire a Margaret Singer quote and then finally a Richard Dawkins quote.
[2:02:30.680 --> 2:02:34.200]  Margaret Singer, the most merciful thing a family does to one of its infant members
[2:02:34.200 --> 2:02:35.560]  is to kill it.
[2:02:35.560 --> 2:02:39.080]  Birth control must lead ultimately to a cleaner race.
[2:02:39.080 --> 2:02:41.080]  Eugenic sterilization is an urgent need.
[2:02:41.080 --> 2:02:44.960]  We must prevent multiplication of this bad stock.
[2:02:44.960 --> 2:02:49.260]  Eugenics is the most adequate and thorough avenue to solution of racial, political and
[2:02:49.260 --> 2:02:50.760]  social problems.
[2:02:50.760 --> 2:02:56.280]  And then Richard Dawkins has this kind of open thought of what if eugenics came back.
[2:02:56.280 --> 2:03:01.280]  In the 1920s and 1930s, scientists from both the political left and right would not have
[2:03:01.280 --> 2:03:05.320]  found the idea of designer babies particularly dangerous, though, of course, they would
[2:03:05.320 --> 2:03:06.840]  not have used that phrase.
[2:03:06.840 --> 2:03:11.240]  Today, I suspect that the idea is too dangerous for comfortable discussion.
[2:03:11.240 --> 2:03:15.240]  In my conjecture is that Adolf Hitler is responsible for the change.
[2:03:15.240 --> 2:03:19.320]  Nobody wants to be caught agreeing with that monster, even in a single particular.
[2:03:19.320 --> 2:03:24.640]  The specter of Hitler has led some scientists to stray from ought to is and deny that breeding
[2:03:24.640 --> 2:03:27.080]  for human qualities is even possible.
[2:03:27.080 --> 2:03:31.880]  But if you can breed cattle for milk, horses for speed, dogs for skill, why shouldn't you
[2:03:31.880 --> 2:03:35.440]  breed humans for mathematical, musical or athletic ability?
[2:03:35.440 --> 2:03:40.880]  I wonder some 60 years after Hitler's death, why we might at least venture to ask what
[2:03:40.880 --> 2:03:44.080]  the moral difference is between breeding for musical ability.
[2:03:44.080 --> 2:03:47.720]  And the problem is with breeding, you're talking about exterminating most of the puppies or
[2:03:47.720 --> 2:03:48.720]  kittens that are born.
[2:03:48.720 --> 2:03:51.720]  You're talking about the state having this incredible control.
[2:03:51.720 --> 2:03:56.840]  And in special breeds, you get more mental illness, more inherited diseases and the elites
[2:03:56.840 --> 2:03:58.000]  that are bred.
[2:03:58.000 --> 2:04:02.280]  Most of their children were born retarded or had serious mental illness problems.
[2:04:02.280 --> 2:04:04.320]  But do they give up this system of control?
[2:04:04.320 --> 2:04:09.880]  No, they've only intensified it down throughout the last hundred plus years.
[2:04:09.880 --> 2:04:13.700]  And now they're practicing their eugenics upon us through the vaccines, through the
[2:04:13.700 --> 2:04:15.320]  chemtrails, through the entire system.
[2:04:15.320 --> 2:04:19.160]  Aaron, I want to have you back up in a couple of weeks again for a whole other discussion
[2:04:19.160 --> 2:04:23.960]  and other areas of eugenics, because this is the governing system, the ideology of the
[2:04:23.960 --> 2:04:24.960]  New World Order.
[2:04:24.960 --> 2:04:28.480]  We've got a special guest coming up after the break, a lot of key videos and things
[2:04:28.480 --> 2:04:33.040]  from what happened in Denver with the MSNBC staff attacking us, is going up on YouTube
[2:04:33.040 --> 2:04:34.040]  later.
[2:04:34.040 --> 2:04:38.680]  That'll be up on infowars.com, the Rage Against the Machine concert being attacked by police.
[2:04:38.680 --> 2:04:43.080]  That's going up on infowars.com and fabled enemies being censored by Google.
[2:04:43.080 --> 2:04:45.080]  That is now up on infowars.com.
[2:04:45.080 --> 2:05:15.000]  Stay with us.
[2:05:15.080 --> 2:05:19.160]  On the history of the fellow reserve, we've got the most well researched and documented

[2:05:46.840 --> 2:05:49.760]  Listener, ask yourself, can I be deceived?
[2:05:49.760 --> 2:05:54.240]  Matthew 24 states four times, in the last days, many will be deceived.
[2:05:54.240 --> 2:05:57.840]  There are many ideas about the mark of the beast and the antichrist.
[2:05:57.840 --> 2:06:01.520]  What do you know about the beast, its mark, and the antichrist?
[2:06:01.520 --> 2:06:05.440]  Is the beast a superpower nation, or a giant computer in Belgium?
[2:06:05.440 --> 2:06:10.720]  Is its mark an implanted chip, a tattoo, the national ID card, or 666?
[2:06:10.720 --> 2:06:13.760]  Is the antichrist a person, title, or both?
[2:06:13.760 --> 2:06:17.560]  Some believe these things are in the future, others believe that it's in the past.
[2:06:17.560 --> 2:06:21.000]  First John states, the antichrist is already in the world.
[2:06:21.000 --> 2:06:22.000]  What is the truth?
[2:06:22.000 --> 2:06:23.080]  And what is a lie?
[2:06:23.080 --> 2:06:25.360]  Are you willing to search God's word for the truth?
[2:06:25.360 --> 2:06:30.480]  Friends, these answers are in the Bible, for free books, DVDs, and Bible studies, exposing
[2:06:30.480 --> 2:06:37.200]  the antichrist, the beast, and its mark, right to the Bible says, Box 99, Lenore City, Tennessee,
[2:06:37.200 --> 2:06:48.800]  37771, or call 888-211-1715, that's 888-211-1715.
[2:06:48.800 --> 2:06:50.920]  We live in a world of vanishing privacy.
[2:06:50.920 --> 2:06:54.800]  The added threat of invisible radio waves sending out personal information to anyone
[2:06:54.800 --> 2:06:58.760]  willing to receive them makes our privacy as citizens even less secure.
[2:06:58.760 --> 2:07:02.640]  The RFID tags and ID cards have been proven to be not secure.
[2:07:02.640 --> 2:07:07.000]  Thieves are able to read information stored on these tags to steal your identity.
[2:07:07.000 --> 2:07:11.880]  Protect yourself from ID theft with our RFID blocker available as a wallet or passport
[2:07:11.880 --> 2:07:12.880]  case.

[2:07:16.320 --> 2:07:20.520]  Many countries including the US have begun to institute RFID and passports.
[2:07:20.520 --> 2:07:21.760]  Why take a chance?
[2:07:21.760 --> 2:07:23.960]  This is your personal information.
[2:07:23.960 --> 2:07:24.960]  Protect yourself.

[2:07:52.160 --> 2:07:56.920]  Big brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[2:07:56.920 --> 2:07:57.920]  You want answers?
[2:07:57.920 --> 2:08:06.360]  Well, so does he, he's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network, and now, live from Austin,
[2:08:06.360 --> 2:08:08.360]  Texas, Alex Jones.
[2:08:08.360 --> 2:08:15.240]  Well, we've got one of the most famous linemen in NFL history, Mark Stepnowski on with us,
[2:08:15.240 --> 2:08:16.240]  pro career in the NFL.
[2:08:16.240 --> 2:08:20.400]  Most of us have been with the Dallas Cowboys and the Houston Oilers.
[2:08:20.400 --> 2:08:26.000]  He won two Super Bowls while with the Cowboys and was a five-time pro bowler, and he is
[2:08:26.000 --> 2:08:27.600]  a 9-11 truther.
[2:08:27.600 --> 2:08:32.640]  We had him on almost a year ago, it was a long time ago, time just flies by, it seems
[2:08:32.640 --> 2:08:39.880]  like yesterday, and he also campaigns for the legalization of marijuana, the decriminalization.
[2:08:39.880 --> 2:08:44.760]  You got 80-plus percent of drug users only use marijuana, they need to keep it that way,
[2:08:44.760 --> 2:08:48.840]  so that they need to keep it illegal so they can SWAT team raid more people and fill more
[2:08:48.840 --> 2:08:53.560]  presence while the government has been caught hundreds of times shipping in heroin and cocaine
[2:08:53.560 --> 2:08:54.560]  and laundering the money.
[2:08:54.560 --> 2:08:59.000]  Did you know it's legal for foreign drug money to be invested in the New York Stock Exchange?
[2:08:59.000 --> 2:09:01.560]  And the former head, Richard Grasso, when he was head of the New York Stock Exchange,
[2:09:01.560 --> 2:09:05.640]  was in Reuters, going to the FARC, communist guerrillas, and saying, invest your cocaine
[2:09:05.640 --> 2:09:06.640]  money with us.
[2:09:06.640 --> 2:09:10.680]  I'm going off on a rant here about the decriminalization of marijuana.
[2:09:10.680 --> 2:09:15.200]  They need to keep it illegal because what is it, 86, 87 percent of people only smoke
[2:09:15.200 --> 2:09:17.360]  marijuana that use illegal drugs.
[2:09:17.360 --> 2:09:19.240]  George Washington smoked it.
[2:09:19.240 --> 2:09:22.560]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, this is an excuse.
[2:09:22.560 --> 2:09:23.560]  What's a greater crime?
[2:09:23.560 --> 2:09:28.840]  Is it black mass SWAT teaming you at 3 a.m. or somebody smoking marijuana?
[2:09:28.840 --> 2:09:32.800]  Do we want this great evil in the name of stopping this minor evil?
[2:09:32.800 --> 2:09:34.320]  And I'm not a marijuana person.
[2:09:34.320 --> 2:09:39.000]  I've smoked marijuana and it's just not my cup of tea, but I know a lot of people that
[2:09:39.000 --> 2:09:42.520]  do smoke it, a lot of doctors and lawyers and people, and they don't need to be SWAT
[2:09:42.520 --> 2:09:43.520]  teamed.
[2:09:43.520 --> 2:09:46.640]  Mark Stepnowski, I really appreciate you coming on with us today.
[2:09:46.640 --> 2:09:47.640]  Thanks, Alex.
[2:09:47.640 --> 2:09:49.160]  It's good to be on with you today.
[2:09:49.160 --> 2:09:51.960]  You're going to be with us for the next 50 minutes at the bottom of the hour.
[2:09:51.960 --> 2:09:56.160]  We're going to open the phones up at 1-800-259-9231.
[2:09:56.160 --> 2:10:00.520]  The last 10 months or so since you were on with us, a lot has happened.
[2:10:00.520 --> 2:10:06.280]  Top Italian former presidents, German defense ministers, Japanese diet members, the best
[2:10:06.280 --> 2:10:08.200]  actress.
[2:10:08.200 --> 2:10:11.720]  So many prominent people have gone public for 9-11 Truth.
[2:10:11.720 --> 2:10:15.240]  Give us your take on the evolution of it and why 9-11 Truth is so important.
[2:10:15.240 --> 2:10:17.320]  Why you took the step of speaking out, Mark.
[2:10:17.320 --> 2:10:22.680]  Yeah, I think it's great to see, like you said, as time goes on, more and more people
[2:10:22.680 --> 2:10:27.320]  are coming forward as they gradually become aware of the facts.
[2:10:27.320 --> 2:10:32.400]  Obviously, through online research and through the amount of books and magazines that have
[2:10:32.400 --> 2:10:38.000]  come out now, enough authors have come forward, stated their opinion.
[2:10:38.000 --> 2:10:44.720]  And I think what's really important now is, obviously, people early on, shortly after the
[2:10:44.720 --> 2:10:50.440]  9-11 attacks, were kind of pigeonholed as conspiracy theorists.
[2:10:50.440 --> 2:10:57.440]  But now, that label, it never did apply, but it's less applicable now than ever, simply
[2:10:57.440 --> 2:11:04.280]  because the people who are coming out in favor of 9-11 Truth are too credible to ignore.
[2:11:04.280 --> 2:11:10.920]  In the last few years, we've had the formation of things like scholars for 9-11 Truth, which
[2:11:10.920 --> 2:11:17.520]  includes architects and engineers for 9-11 Truth, pilots for 9-11 Truth.
[2:11:17.520 --> 2:11:23.600]  We have former people who worked in government, including the current administration, who
[2:11:23.600 --> 2:11:26.600]  are coming out and saying that they don't believe the official story.
[2:11:26.600 --> 2:11:31.680]  So, it's just a case of, you know, as more people become exposed to it, as the media
[2:11:31.680 --> 2:11:37.960]  blackouts and mainstream media continues, mostly via the Internet, people are becoming
[2:11:37.960 --> 2:11:43.000]  connected and becoming aware of these facts and voicing their opinion.
[2:11:43.000 --> 2:11:49.440]  It's very encouraging to see, you know, it's never too late for anybody who feels strongly
[2:11:49.440 --> 2:11:55.400]  about this issue to come forward and voice their opinion, because I think as time goes
[2:11:55.400 --> 2:12:02.240]  on, people will be surprised to find out that if they are no longer worried about expressing
[2:12:02.240 --> 2:12:06.840]  their skepticism of the official story regarding 9-11, they will find out that there are a
[2:12:06.840 --> 2:12:13.160]  lot of people out there, you might refer to them as a silent majority, who also feel very
[2:12:13.160 --> 2:12:14.640]  much the same way.
[2:12:14.640 --> 2:12:22.760]  They are either too afraid or too reluctant to come forward and also express their doubts
[2:12:22.760 --> 2:12:23.760]  in the official story.
[2:12:23.760 --> 2:12:24.760]  What made you go public?
[2:12:24.760 --> 2:12:31.000]  I mean, what made you to, I mean, you were one of the first prominent sports figures
[2:12:31.000 --> 2:12:32.000]  to go public.
[2:12:32.000 --> 2:12:37.560]  I mean, now Willie Nelson has gone public, Jesse Ventura has gone public.
[2:12:37.560 --> 2:12:43.960]  I mean, it's just exponential, but what made you decide to take that leap?
[2:12:43.960 --> 2:12:52.000]  I just, you know, I got tired of waiting for the channels of government to move along
[2:12:52.000 --> 2:12:53.400]  in a proper fashion.
[2:12:53.400 --> 2:13:01.440]  You know, like a lot of people, I had hope, it turns out to be false hope in retrospect,
[2:13:01.440 --> 2:13:07.000]  but I had hope at the time that, you know, maybe the 9-11 commission would be legitimate.
[2:13:07.000 --> 2:13:12.760]  You know, maybe, you know, the safeguards that are in place in constitutional government,
[2:13:12.760 --> 2:13:17.360]  I thought that they would kick in and operate in the manner in which they're supposed
[2:13:17.360 --> 2:13:27.560]  to, and we would see a proper investigation, you know, with relevant witnesses and evidence.
[2:13:27.560 --> 2:13:31.560]  And as we all know, none of that really came to fruition.
[2:13:31.560 --> 2:13:37.960]  The 9-11 commission was a sham, it was a cover up, it was a modern day version of the Warren
[2:13:37.960 --> 2:13:46.040]  Commission as far as its attempt to silence witnesses and suppress truth tellers.
[2:13:46.040 --> 2:13:53.240]  And you know, when things reached that point, and that commission was shown to be the impotent
[2:13:53.240 --> 2:13:55.240]  vehicle that it was.
[2:13:55.240 --> 2:14:01.200]  I just felt compelled to in my own small way say whatever I could as far as what I thought
[2:14:01.200 --> 2:14:02.200]  the truth was.
[2:14:02.200 --> 2:14:08.160]  Mark, Mark, that isn't in your own small way, you know, it's not just that you're a celebrity
[2:14:08.160 --> 2:14:12.840]  or a well-known sports figure, it's that people resonate with the courage of a Willie Nelson
[2:14:12.840 --> 2:14:19.360]  or a Mark Stipnowski or a former German defense minister or a former governor.
[2:14:19.360 --> 2:14:24.960]  They resonate, and they know that person has a lot to lose, that person's going to be demonized.
[2:14:24.960 --> 2:14:27.440]  This person is really stepping up.
[2:14:27.440 --> 2:14:31.720]  And so that's what makes you and so many others that have stood up and gone public heroes.
[2:14:31.720 --> 2:14:33.600]  But look at the vindication.
[2:14:33.600 --> 2:14:39.800]  The Chicago Tribune four months ago reported, as well as Associated Press, the NSA declassified
[2:14:39.800 --> 2:14:44.280]  that Israel did attack the U.S. as a celebrity to try to sink it, to blame it on Egypt to
[2:14:44.280 --> 2:14:49.320]  start World War III, as they've now tried, the U.S. has tried in Georgia.
[2:14:49.320 --> 2:14:50.320]  It's now come out.
[2:14:50.320 --> 2:14:54.360]  Psy Hirsch at a big media event, and he did admit New Yorker magazine that Cheney, he
[2:14:54.360 --> 2:14:55.960]  just said a stage provocation.
[2:14:55.960 --> 2:15:02.520]  He said, this is the provocation, to have U.S. Navy SEALs dressed up like Iranians on
[2:15:02.520 --> 2:15:07.880]  blue PT boats, attack U.S. ships in the Strait of Hormuz.
[2:15:07.880 --> 2:15:12.920]  So government-sponsored terror, the fact that Gulf of Tonkin was staged, that's all coming
[2:15:12.920 --> 2:15:13.920]  out now.
[2:15:13.920 --> 2:15:18.000]  And people say, well, that was seven years ago, you know, 9-11, why are you so concerned?
[2:15:18.000 --> 2:15:25.560]  Well, because Black Ops is going to continue to stage terror attacks as a pretext for control
[2:15:25.560 --> 2:15:28.680]  if we don't step up and expose that they're behind it.
[2:15:28.680 --> 2:15:30.200]  Mark your comments on that.
[2:15:30.200 --> 2:15:33.360]  Yeah, I entirely agree.
[2:15:33.360 --> 2:15:35.440]  It's been a steady progression.
[2:15:35.440 --> 2:15:38.280]  It's been, you know, just one incident after another.
[2:15:38.280 --> 2:15:46.480]  We saw last year where Bush and Tony Blair had the plan to send U.S. military planes
[2:15:46.480 --> 2:15:52.920]  over Iran disguised as U.N. planes to try and instigate an attack on them so we would
[2:15:52.920 --> 2:15:56.480]  be justified in responding.
[2:15:56.480 --> 2:16:03.080]  I remember also last year, as a big New Brzezinski appearing in the press, practically coming
[2:16:03.080 --> 2:16:09.840]  right out and saying, you know, we had to worry about the current administration putting
[2:16:09.840 --> 2:16:14.080]  together a false flag terror op to stimulate war with Iran.
[2:16:14.080 --> 2:16:19.760]  But this is a guy who is now Barack Obama's main foreign policy advisor.
[2:16:19.760 --> 2:16:25.720]  So, again, we have these people coming out, you know, in mainstream media within the last
[2:16:25.720 --> 2:16:31.040]  year with these, you know, scenarios that have come and gone that have involved false
[2:16:31.040 --> 2:16:32.040]  flag terror.
[2:16:32.040 --> 2:16:37.480]  So I just think in this day and age, people are becoming a little bit too hip to what's
[2:16:37.480 --> 2:16:38.480]  going on.
[2:16:38.480 --> 2:16:42.760]  They understand ahead of time similar will happen in Spain when you have the false flag
[2:16:42.760 --> 2:16:45.040]  terror attack there with the trains.
[2:16:45.040 --> 2:16:48.560]  The people in days came out in the hundreds of thousands and said, we know you did it
[2:16:48.560 --> 2:16:51.280]  and it turned out it was the intelligence operation.
[2:16:51.280 --> 2:16:52.280]  Exactly.
[2:16:52.280 --> 2:16:56.720]  Hopefully, we are reaching that point now in North America, you know, so if you call
[2:16:56.720 --> 2:17:02.280]  critical mass or whatever you want to, but hopefully through, you know, the work that
[2:17:02.280 --> 2:17:08.640]  you do and statements made by 9-11 truthers like myself and the many others around the
[2:17:08.640 --> 2:17:14.240]  world, you know, we have people, a politician in Japanese parliament came out wanting to
[2:17:14.240 --> 2:17:17.360]  have another investigation.
[2:17:17.360 --> 2:17:23.440]  We're having a march in Canada to Ottawa to culminate on September 11th where they're
[2:17:23.440 --> 2:17:29.480]  going to present a petition at Parliament Hill for a new 9-11 investigation in Canada.
[2:17:29.480 --> 2:17:35.080]  So I think, you know, worldwide, you're seeing people come around and, you know, waking up
[2:17:35.080 --> 2:17:39.640]  to the fact that this was a false flag operation, you know, to have a certain effect on the
[2:17:39.640 --> 2:17:40.640]  American public.
[2:17:40.640 --> 2:17:46.600]  The question now is, you know, are the people who live in America going to be smart enough
[2:17:46.600 --> 2:17:54.360]  to look into the right sources of information to kind of emancipate themselves from this
[2:17:54.360 --> 2:17:56.960]  media blackout that's going on?
[2:17:56.960 --> 2:18:04.920]  I think if people continue to turn off their TVs, give less credence to mainstream media
[2:18:04.920 --> 2:18:13.520]  corporate media and instead, you know, read online, read books, read magazines, anything
[2:18:13.520 --> 2:18:20.200]  out there that's going to give the true story of 9-11 truth, this is what's going to mobilize
[2:18:20.200 --> 2:18:27.040]  the population in America so that when another false flag terrorist attack occurs, whatever
[2:18:27.040 --> 2:18:33.560]  it is, whether it's bioterror, whether it's a mini nuke somewhere, people will see it for
[2:18:33.560 --> 2:18:40.320]  what it is and not be railroaded into a certain mindset like they were after 9-11.
[2:18:40.320 --> 2:18:48.000]  We're talking to Super Bowl champion, two-time Mark Stepnowski, five-time pro bowler, and
[2:18:48.000 --> 2:18:52.320]  he's, again, going public, not because it's fun, but because it's his duty, and I would
[2:18:52.320 --> 2:18:56.840]  venture to say because he just said it, he knows that if we don't expose the tool of
[2:18:56.840 --> 2:19:01.280]  false flag, that mechanism, this military industrial complex is going to keep doing
[2:19:01.280 --> 2:19:05.040]  it to hurt us, just like in England how they hunt pheasants.
[2:19:05.040 --> 2:19:10.120]  They beat pots and pans, they have beaters who push the birds out in a wedge so the hunters
[2:19:10.120 --> 2:19:13.920]  can shoot them when they get driven out, and it's the same thing, you want to attack Iran,
[2:19:13.920 --> 2:19:18.400]  you want to attack Iraq, you stage an event, you want to attack Egypt, you stage an event,
[2:19:18.400 --> 2:19:24.400]  they've been caught over and over and they're going to continue to do this if we don't expose
[2:19:24.400 --> 2:19:31.720]  it, and that's why the courage of now thousands of prominent people that have gone public
[2:19:31.720 --> 2:19:35.800]  for 9-11 Truth, and now all these architecture engineers and physicists is unstoppable.
[2:19:35.800 --> 2:19:40.840]  We're going to come back and talk about the fraudulent new NIST report with Mark Stepnowski,
[2:19:40.840 --> 2:19:42.560]  and then we're going to take your phone calls.
[2:19:42.560 --> 2:19:45.240]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[2:19:45.240 --> 2:19:46.240]  Gold.
[2:19:46.240 --> 2:19:49.640]  It's like nothing else on earth.
[2:19:49.640 --> 2:19:54.080]  From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the industrial age to the space age, gold
[2:19:54.080 --> 2:19:55.880]  has weathered the test of time.
[2:19:55.880 --> 2:20:00.240]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[2:20:00.240 --> 2:20:04.360]  According to the World Gold Council in the U.S. Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[2:20:04.360 --> 2:20:08.840]  The stage is being set for the reemergence of gold as the common sense alternative to
[2:20:08.840 --> 2:20:12.720]  a fiat paper currency that gets weaker every day.
[2:20:12.720 --> 2:20:17.360]  Midas Resources is proud to offer the hard-hitting report that arms you with the truth you need
[2:20:17.360 --> 2:20:21.680]  to protect you and your family from the Fed's plans for your hard-earned money.

[2:20:26.520 --> 2:20:27.520]  as gold.
[2:20:27.520 --> 2:20:33.200]  Call 1-800-686-2237 for the report the Fed hopes you'll never see.
[2:20:33.200 --> 2:20:38.040]  As good as gold can be yours by calling 800-686-2237.
[2:20:38.040 --> 2:20:42.440]  If you have ever thought about owning gold, you must read this report.
[2:20:42.440 --> 2:20:46.840]  Call Midas today at 800-686-2237.
[2:20:46.840 --> 2:20:52.000]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war
[2:20:52.000 --> 2:20:53.520]  against this country.
[2:20:53.520 --> 2:20:57.360]  The enemy struck America on September 11th, but who is the enemy?
[2:20:57.360 --> 2:20:58.360]  Bin Laden.
[2:20:58.360 --> 2:20:59.360]  This is his MO.
[2:20:59.360 --> 2:21:00.360]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[2:21:00.360 --> 2:21:02.560]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[2:21:02.560 --> 2:21:07.480]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence
[2:21:07.480 --> 2:21:10.080]  networks inside the United States.
[2:21:10.080 --> 2:21:13.960]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis, again, very much engaged in
[2:21:13.960 --> 2:21:16.720]  spying in and on the U.S.
[2:21:16.720 --> 2:21:20.440]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[2:21:20.440 --> 2:21:25.880]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers' ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection,
[2:21:25.880 --> 2:21:30.040]  the Israeli intelligence network, warnings in war games, the shadow government, and much,
[2:21:30.040 --> 2:21:31.040]  much more.
[2:21:31.040 --> 2:21:32.040]  Fabled Enemies.

[2:21:37.000 --> 2:21:39.520]  other titles at prisonplanet.tv.
[2:21:39.520 --> 2:21:46.560]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[2:21:46.560 --> 2:21:51.560]  Fled from solder and copper pipes, mercury from fish, dental fillings, vaccines, arsenic
[2:21:51.560 --> 2:21:52.560]  in the water.
[2:21:52.560 --> 2:21:56.360]  These heavy metal toxins are difficult or even impossible to avoid.
[2:21:56.360 --> 2:22:00.320]  Even trace amounts of these heavy metals over time can impact your health.
[2:22:00.320 --> 2:22:04.280]  Many health problems have been suggested as being related to this heavy metal exposure,
[2:22:04.280 --> 2:22:08.480]  including memory loss, high blood pressure, depression, mood swings, speech disorders,
[2:22:08.480 --> 2:22:11.920]  neuropathy, autoimmune diseases, chronic fatigue, and more.
[2:22:11.920 --> 2:22:16.080]  Unfortunately, traditional detoxifying isn't able to clear the body of these harmful and
[2:22:16.080 --> 2:22:18.120]  potentially deadly toxins.
[2:22:18.120 --> 2:22:21.040]  That's why there's Puricleer from Ripple Creek.
[2:22:21.040 --> 2:22:24.840]  Puricleer contains a proprietary blend of ingredients, including a cilantro extract
[2:22:24.840 --> 2:22:30.680]  and alphalipoic acid, among other ingredients formulated specifically to promote body cleansing.
[2:22:30.680 --> 2:22:35.200]  Puricleer also has ingredients selected to promote improved circulation to enhance activity,
[2:22:35.200 --> 2:22:39.040]  so that heavy metals may be more effectively captured and removed from the body.
[2:22:39.040 --> 2:22:46.040]  For Puricleer now, by calling Ripple Creek at 203-331-0363 or go to RippleCreek.com.

[2:24:01.840 --> 2:24:04.440]  Two-time Super Bowl champion with the Dallas Cowboys.
[2:24:04.440 --> 2:24:09.440]  He's also played with the Oilers' five-time pro bowler, Mark Stepnosky, on the line.
[2:24:09.440 --> 2:24:14.440]  I remember sitting around watching the Cowboys play and rooting for Mark.
[2:24:14.440 --> 2:24:18.440]  Now I'm rooting for him in a much more important way, and that is his courage.
[2:24:18.440 --> 2:24:23.440]  Speaking out for 9-11-3, there's a ballot initiative in New York to get a new investigation going,
[2:24:23.440 --> 2:24:25.440]  or expose that, a grand jury.
[2:24:25.440 --> 2:24:27.440]  There's a lot of different initiatives.
[2:24:27.440 --> 2:24:33.440]  There's marches going on, events coming up in New York next week that I hope folks go to.
[2:24:33.440 --> 2:24:39.440]  Let's talk about that ballot initiative first, and then I want to get into the NIST report, Mark.
[2:24:39.440 --> 2:24:45.440]  Yeah, obviously, since we're coming up on the anniversary of 9-11, there's a lot of activities going around
[2:24:45.440 --> 2:24:48.440]  to highlight the fact that the official story is untrue.
[2:24:48.440 --> 2:24:51.440]  One of those is in New York City.
[2:24:51.440 --> 2:24:53.440]  It's a 9-11 ballot initiative.
[2:24:53.440 --> 2:25:00.440]  This is a way for, I mean, it's obvious, like I said earlier, that we're not going to get a proper investigation
[2:25:00.440 --> 2:25:02.440]  through government channels.
[2:25:02.440 --> 2:25:07.440]  But this is a way for the people of New York City to create a new 9-11 commission,
[2:25:07.440 --> 2:25:12.440]  an investigation of the events, which would have subpoena power.
[2:25:12.440 --> 2:25:16.440]  It would have some legal authority.
[2:25:16.440 --> 2:25:20.440]  Volunteers in New York City have been going around getting signatures on petitions.
[2:25:20.440 --> 2:25:24.440]  They needed a minimum of $30,000, which they just recently achieved.
[2:25:24.440 --> 2:25:26.440]  So that was great news.
[2:25:26.440 --> 2:25:32.440]  All these petitions will be submitted to the New York City Clerk and New York City Council.
[2:25:32.440 --> 2:25:39.440]  And with the sufficient amount of signatures, just being above $30,000,
[2:25:39.440 --> 2:25:46.440]  they will be able to present this, and then it can become an issue, a topic on the ballot.
[2:25:46.440 --> 2:25:54.440]  I believe it would be part of the 2009 ballot for mayor, the election of mayor in New York City,
[2:25:54.440 --> 2:25:57.440]  where citizens can vote for themselves.
[2:25:57.440 --> 2:26:04.440]  They can make their voices heard that they think it is necessary as citizens of that city,
[2:26:04.440 --> 2:26:11.440]  as voters of New York City, to demand a new investigation, one that actually has some teeth.
[2:26:11.440 --> 2:26:13.440]  Absolutely.
[2:26:13.440 --> 2:26:15.440]  And it shouldn't just be New York.
[2:26:15.440 --> 2:26:20.440]  We need lots of grand jury type public investigations, both governmental and non-governmental,
[2:26:20.440 --> 2:26:24.440]  to draw this out publicly and continue to expose it.
[2:26:24.440 --> 2:26:31.440]  Everything is a step to use a football analogy for more yards to get a new set of downs towards the touchdown,
[2:26:31.440 --> 2:26:33.440]  bringing these criminals to justice.
[2:26:33.440 --> 2:26:37.440]  And even if we never bring them to quote justice by sending them to prison,
[2:26:37.440 --> 2:26:44.440]  by publicly convicting them in the court of public opinion and by educating the public about false flag terrorism,
[2:26:44.440 --> 2:26:48.440]  it breaks that tool that the black ops continue to use.
[2:26:48.440 --> 2:26:50.440]  What's your take on that?
[2:26:50.440 --> 2:26:51.440]  Yeah, without a doubt.
[2:26:51.440 --> 2:26:54.440]  It's all a question of just mobilizing the masses.
[2:26:54.440 --> 2:26:59.440]  I think a lot of people fall into a defeatist attitude of what can I do?
[2:26:59.440 --> 2:27:01.440]  How can I make a difference?
[2:27:01.440 --> 2:27:03.440]  I'm only one person.
[2:27:03.440 --> 2:27:07.440]  Well, just by signing that petition, just by signing your name on that piece of paper,
[2:27:07.440 --> 2:27:13.440]  you are in effect saying, look, I don't believe in what the government is telling me.
[2:27:13.440 --> 2:27:17.440]  I don't believe the lies that I'm being told in corporate media.
[2:27:17.440 --> 2:27:20.440]  So I demand a new investigation.
[2:27:20.440 --> 2:27:23.440]  This is one way for people to have their voice heard.
[2:27:23.440 --> 2:27:26.440]  People who otherwise might feel powerless.
[2:27:26.440 --> 2:27:28.440]  There's a lot of people in New York City.
[2:27:28.440 --> 2:27:33.440]  If a lot of them mobilize, it might be surprising what could actually happen.
[2:27:33.440 --> 2:27:42.440]  But I urge listeners of your show who either live in New York City or have family or friends there to let them know about this.
[2:27:42.440 --> 2:27:52.440]  And look it up on www.nyc911initiative.org and find out anything they would like to about this movement.
[2:27:52.440 --> 2:27:59.440]  But I think that, you know, right now it's moving along very nicely and should it succeed in any degree.
[2:27:59.440 --> 2:28:00.440]  It'll be a big step forward.
[2:28:00.440 --> 2:28:02.440]  It really could be a brain, bro.
[2:28:02.440 --> 2:28:05.440]  And a lot of people have this loser mentality of all will never be corruption.
[2:28:05.440 --> 2:28:07.440]  Oh, there's no point.
[2:28:07.440 --> 2:28:09.440]  Ladies and gentlemen, we don't have a choice.
[2:28:09.440 --> 2:28:11.440]  Number one, number two, we're actually having an effect.
[2:28:11.440 --> 2:28:14.440]  The majority of Americans in major polls believe there's a 9-11 cover-up.
[2:28:14.440 --> 2:28:16.440]  There's hundreds of these polls.
[2:28:16.440 --> 2:28:17.440]  We're having an effect.
[2:28:17.440 --> 2:28:21.440]  Look how far we've come from myself two months before the attacks saying,
[2:28:21.440 --> 2:28:25.440]  I think they're going to attack the World Trade Center and blame it on their asset bin Laden.
[2:28:25.440 --> 2:28:28.440]  Because I saw them preparing the public, introducing bin Laden.
[2:28:28.440 --> 2:28:29.440]  I knew their past history.
[2:28:29.440 --> 2:28:32.440]  I knew the FBI had cooked the bomb, framed the driver, given them the detonators,
[2:28:32.440 --> 2:28:36.440]  blocked local police in 93 with the first attack.
[2:28:36.440 --> 2:28:40.440]  I mean, again, look how far we've come from 9-11 that first day.
[2:28:40.440 --> 2:28:42.440]  Look how far we've come.
[2:28:42.440 --> 2:28:48.440]  Thanks to people like Mark Stepnowski, Willie Nelson, Governor Ventura, Stephen Jones.
[2:28:48.440 --> 2:28:51.440]  Now, I'm going to skip this break for infowars.com.
[2:28:51.440 --> 2:28:53.440]  We'll be back in three minutes.
[2:28:53.440 --> 2:28:57.440]  Because I don't want to waste any time that we've got with Mark Stepnowski today.
[2:28:57.440 --> 2:29:01.440]  But Mark, that NIST report, they delayed it three years.
[2:29:01.440 --> 2:29:05.440]  The people on the government NIST board are involved in explosive thermite research.
[2:29:05.440 --> 2:29:06.440]  They're experts.
[2:29:06.440 --> 2:29:08.440]  They're involved in government contracts.
[2:29:08.440 --> 2:29:12.440]  And then they had to pull back.
[2:29:12.440 --> 2:29:18.440]  They had to say, okay, our last five reasons for the towers falling and buildings having fallen are wrong.
[2:29:18.440 --> 2:29:20.440]  It's not fuel oil tank.
[2:29:20.440 --> 2:29:22.440]  It's not bad building construction.
[2:29:22.440 --> 2:29:23.440]  It's not fires.
[2:29:23.440 --> 2:29:29.440]  It's not, no, no, they gave a new reason, a new syndrome, a new phenomenon.
[2:29:29.440 --> 2:29:32.440]  We're going to cover that right now with Mark Stepnowski.
[2:29:32.440 --> 2:29:33.440]  Stay with us.
[2:29:33.440 --> 2:29:38.440]  We're on the march.
[2:29:38.440 --> 2:29:41.440]  The Empire's on the run.
[2:29:41.440 --> 2:29:44.440]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[2:29:47.440 --> 2:29:53.440]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to Ground Zero.
[2:29:53.440 --> 2:29:55.440]  And we knew what to do.
[2:29:55.440 --> 2:29:56.440]  Or at least we thought we did.
[2:29:56.440 --> 2:30:03.440]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[2:30:03.440 --> 2:30:12.440]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18 made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[2:30:12.440 --> 2:30:19.440]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[2:30:19.440 --> 2:30:22.440]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[2:30:22.440 --> 2:30:28.440]  He takes his hand off in a year, three, two, one, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[2:30:28.440 --> 2:30:31.440]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.

[2:30:40.440 --> 2:30:46.440]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[2:30:46.440 --> 2:30:50.440]  You ever have one of those days where everything goes right?
[2:30:50.440 --> 2:30:52.440]  First, I get the best parking space at work.
[2:30:52.440 --> 2:30:55.440]  Tonight, I have a date with a very lovely Rachel.
[2:30:55.440 --> 2:30:58.440]  And today, I gave a killer presentation in Sydney.
[2:30:58.440 --> 2:31:02.440]  Finalized the contract in London and demoed our new product in Boston.
[2:31:02.440 --> 2:31:05.440]  Online from my desk with WebEx.
[2:31:05.440 --> 2:31:08.440]  WebEx lets me take meetings and give presentations from my desk.
[2:31:08.440 --> 2:31:13.440]  I just talked to clients on the phone and they watch what's happening on my desktop from their desktop.
[2:31:13.440 --> 2:31:17.440]  So I can travel the world and still be here for my date tonight with Rachel.

[2:31:46.440 --> 2:31:48.440]  Did you know that it's a documented fact?
[2:31:48.440 --> 2:31:55.440]  80% of all Americans and 85% of people around the world suffer from internal parasites and parasitic infection?
[2:31:55.440 --> 2:32:00.440]  You may be one of millions of people suffering from one of dozens of debilitating chronic diseases.
[2:32:00.440 --> 2:32:03.440]  From these parasites and your doctor would never know it.
[2:32:03.440 --> 2:32:08.440]  In fact, clinically detected parasites account for only 1% of all cases.
[2:32:08.440 --> 2:32:11.440]  Don't continue to suffer from pain due to misdiagnosis.
[2:32:11.440 --> 2:32:15.440]  Now you can fight internal parasites, heavy metal poisoning and high cholesterol.

[2:32:54.440 --> 2:33:00.440]  Oski, we're bringing up the NIST report and how they've had to change how physics works.
[2:33:00.440 --> 2:33:06.440]  And so a lot of scientists and physicists and architects that weren't involved and didn't believe it was an inside job are now looking going.
[2:33:06.440 --> 2:33:13.440]  You're saying jet fuel made 2600 degree pockets of stuff five weeks later, thousands of degrees hotter?
[2:33:13.440 --> 2:33:22.440]  I mean, this is, I mean, NIST coming out and saying now small fires bring down steel buildings is changing everything. Mark, continue.
[2:33:22.440 --> 2:33:31.440]  Yeah, just, I mean, this is coincides with the Bush administration's technique from day one.
[2:33:31.440 --> 2:33:39.440]  They have actively sought to discredit science and to really argue with scientific belief.
[2:33:39.440 --> 2:33:51.440]  You know, it doesn't matter whether it's the EPA, the FDA, whatever it is, you know, there's been active warfare on the part of the Bush administration against science.
[2:33:51.440 --> 2:33:54.440]  And this is another clear-cut example of that.
[2:33:54.440 --> 2:33:57.440]  Well, it's like marijuana. They know marijuana doesn't kill one person a year.
[2:33:57.440 --> 2:34:03.440]  It's a miracle drug with thousands of patented real things it does for cancer, glaucoma.
[2:34:03.440 --> 2:34:07.440]  But there's still SWAT team and people every day where I live looking for marijuana.
[2:34:07.440 --> 2:34:15.440]  Absolutely. No matter how much evidence you present, no matter how authoritative that evidence is,
[2:34:15.440 --> 2:34:24.440]  no matter who it comes from, as far as, you know, credible scientific or medical establishments, it will just be written off by propaganda.
[2:34:24.440 --> 2:34:31.440]  You know, it really is an info war. You can present any kind of factual evidence you want to support your theory.
[2:34:31.440 --> 2:34:38.440]  But again, you know, corporate media, the Republican or Democratic party, they'll just write it off with propaganda.
[2:34:38.440 --> 2:34:41.440]  But that is starting, sorry, go ahead.
[2:34:41.440 --> 2:34:44.440]  I'm sorry, but that is what we are seeing right now.
[2:34:44.440 --> 2:34:55.440]  Which is another, by this NIST report, trying to come out and explain why something that's never happened before did happen, namely three steel buildings collapsing because of fire one day.
[2:34:55.440 --> 2:35:03.440]  They do have to stretch the realms of reality. You know, they do have to contradict science and offer an alternative view, which is completely bogus.
[2:35:03.440 --> 2:35:13.440]  Which is why I'm glad to see that people with, people who are experts, people whose backgrounds are in this field are coming forward and saying,
[2:35:13.440 --> 2:35:20.440]  look, you guys are just straining any credibility you have here to the breaking point. We can't accept this.
[2:35:20.440 --> 2:35:27.440]  The only thing is, you know, these are things that's coming out in scientific journals and in academic papers that appear reviewed.
[2:35:27.440 --> 2:35:32.440]  These are not things that appear on the evening news or are going to be on a front page headline.
[2:35:32.440 --> 2:35:38.440]  You know, that's a great point. First they said, like three or four years ago, oh, let's see some studies.
[2:35:38.440 --> 2:35:44.440]  And then they did studies. Let's see them be peer reviewed. Then a couple of them get peer reviewed by major, major peer reviewed.
[2:35:44.440 --> 2:35:51.440]  I mean, not just side journals, big marquee, you know, super bowl level journals. We're talking the big ones.
[2:35:51.440 --> 2:36:00.440]  They're the most prestigious and then they try to write that off. I mean, we keep clearing every hurdle mark and the other side is just looking stupider and stupider.
[2:36:00.440 --> 2:36:06.440]  And I believe that NIST itself is part of the executive branch, correct?
[2:36:06.440 --> 2:36:07.440]  Yes, yes.
[2:36:07.440 --> 2:36:15.440]  So there we see another example, you know, just like the Office of National Drug Control Policy is part of the executive branch.
[2:36:15.440 --> 2:36:19.440]  And they are the ones who constantly spew forth misinformation about the drug war.
[2:36:19.440 --> 2:36:28.440]  We have NIST, which is also an executive branch administration, you know, leading the charge about the lives regarding 9-11.
[2:36:28.440 --> 2:36:33.440]  Well, like you said, though, more and more people are tuning out of mainstream media.
[2:36:33.440 --> 2:36:38.440]  It's exponential and instead of them reporting some of the truth, they're trying to act more credible.
[2:36:38.440 --> 2:36:44.440]  It seems like they're getting more shrill, more cartoonish, more ridiculous, piling lie on top of lie.
[2:36:44.440 --> 2:36:48.440]  I don't know what the tactic is there, but it doesn't seem to be working, Mark.
[2:36:48.440 --> 2:36:55.440]  Well, it reminds me of the old quote about, and I can't remember who said it, but it's just the old quote about truth coming out, you know.
[2:36:55.440 --> 2:37:07.440]  First, when you are a truth teller, you know, in this age of universal deceit that we live in, where those of us are trying to commit a revolutionary act by telling the truth,
[2:37:07.440 --> 2:37:12.440]  you know, it becomes evident that, you know, we will be attacked.
[2:37:12.440 --> 2:37:15.440]  That's the first method.
[2:37:15.440 --> 2:37:21.440]  Actually, the first method is to be written off and ridiculed, and that was the case early on after September 11th.
[2:37:21.440 --> 2:37:22.440]  Yes.
[2:37:22.440 --> 2:37:25.440]  You know, the religion holders, conspiracy theorists, and we were out of our minds.
[2:37:25.440 --> 2:37:26.440]  So that was the ridicule.
[2:37:26.440 --> 2:37:28.440]  Then you had the vicious attacks.
[2:37:28.440 --> 2:37:36.440]  You know, now it's becoming obvious that, you know, the 9-11 truth movement is based on truth and facts and evidence.
[2:37:36.440 --> 2:37:40.440]  We are being maliciously attacked.
[2:37:40.440 --> 2:37:41.440]  Yes.
[2:37:41.440 --> 2:37:45.440]  And then, you know, I just wanted to follow up again with that famous quotation,
[2:37:45.440 --> 2:37:49.440]  the third stage of the truth being accepted is that people will accept it.
[2:37:49.440 --> 2:37:54.440]  I think now we are in the second stage, you know, those first few years we were attacked and vilified.
[2:37:54.440 --> 2:37:56.440]  I'm sorry, we were ridiculed.
[2:37:56.440 --> 2:37:59.440]  Now we are being attacked and vilified.
[2:37:59.440 --> 2:38:10.440]  Hopefully, we are coming close to that third stage where there will be mass acceptance of this truth and people won't be afraid to put aside their cognitive dissonance
[2:38:10.440 --> 2:38:15.440]  and step out and accept this new paradigm of reality that we all have to see around us.
[2:38:15.440 --> 2:38:16.440]  Oh, beautifully put.
[2:38:16.440 --> 2:38:21.440]  And that's really it. I don't blame a lot of people who don't want to look at the facts because every night when I go to bed,
[2:38:21.440 --> 2:38:27.440]  I look at how innocent my children are, I look at how good my wife is and I just think, God, there are really evil people in this world
[2:38:27.440 --> 2:38:32.440]  and they really are in control and I've really gotten their face and, man, I've been threatened and this is dangerous.
[2:38:32.440 --> 2:38:36.440]  Then I realize, you know, I just can't let the world go on like this.
[2:38:36.440 --> 2:38:39.440]  I've got to do my job whether it has an effect or not.
[2:38:39.440 --> 2:38:44.440]  But the truth is when good people do get involved, I believe as Thomas Jefferson said, you know, that we can't overturn evil.
[2:38:44.440 --> 2:38:48.440]  It's evil only wins when good men and women do nothing.
[2:38:48.440 --> 2:38:53.440]  And you're right. First they ignore you, then they attack you, then you win.
[2:38:53.440 --> 2:38:59.440]  And that's basically what's happening now and there's another quote I'm butchering but paraphrasing.
[2:38:59.440 --> 2:39:01.440]  But, you know, truth goes through three stages.
[2:39:01.440 --> 2:39:08.440]  First it's, you know, a laugh debt, then it's ridiculed, then it's accepted as, you know, universally true.
[2:39:08.440 --> 2:39:13.440]  And people who said the world was round were laughed at and now we know it's round, Mark.
[2:39:13.440 --> 2:39:20.440]  Well, yeah, and just, you know, for me personally, you know, again, I think we should all just do what we can, you know.
[2:39:20.440 --> 2:39:26.440]  Different people have different amounts of time, different resources, be they financial or whatever.
[2:39:26.440 --> 2:39:31.440]  But I just felt personally as an American citizen, it was my duty to speak out.
[2:39:31.440 --> 2:39:40.440]  You know, I was asked to do a newspaper article for my hometown and it was just one of those deals.
[2:39:40.440 --> 2:39:44.440]  And where are they now? What are they doing now that they're retired?
[2:39:44.440 --> 2:39:51.440]  And I just, again, I felt compelled to at least let people in Erie, Pennsylvania, my hometown, who read the paper,
[2:39:51.440 --> 2:39:57.440]  know that somebody who came from there doesn't believe in the official story of 9-11
[2:39:57.440 --> 2:40:02.440]  and, you know, wholeheartedly believe that they too should seek out the truth for themselves.
[2:40:02.440 --> 2:40:08.440]  What type of response? I mean, I know overwhelmingly it was positive but what type of negative responses did you get
[2:40:08.440 --> 2:40:12.440]  and what was it like with your moral courage to go through that and not recant?
[2:40:12.440 --> 2:40:20.440]  Well, you know, the reaction overwhelmingly was positive. I mean, I don't spend a lot of time in my hometown anymore
[2:40:20.440 --> 2:40:25.440]  and I know that there were people who wrote in letters saying, you know, what's wrong with this guy?
[2:40:25.440 --> 2:40:33.440]  He's way out in that field. But like we discussed earlier, now that we are, you know, coming up on eight years after the fact,
[2:40:33.440 --> 2:40:40.440]  people are coming, I'm sorry, seven years after the fact, people are becoming aware of what actually happened that day.
[2:40:40.440 --> 2:40:44.440]  You know, the initial shock value of that psychological operation is wearing off.
[2:40:44.440 --> 2:40:47.440]  People are getting a chance to see what really went on behind the scenes.
[2:40:47.440 --> 2:40:57.440]  So I didn't really suffer much fallout at all. You know, just again, regardless of how many people might write in,
[2:40:57.440 --> 2:41:01.440]  there's always going to be a few, you know, who will just personally attack you.
[2:41:01.440 --> 2:41:07.440]  It's the same thing when I spoke out against marijuana laws. You know, you have people saying that you're not a good role model.
[2:41:07.440 --> 2:41:11.440]  You know, that you're a proponent of drug use and everything else.
[2:41:11.440 --> 2:41:18.440]  Yeah, but you go to a football game and there's liquor ads everywhere, which no doubt is bad for you.
[2:41:18.440 --> 2:41:23.440]  But then, you know, these guys with a whiskey bottle, hell dare you be with that Murrow Warner?
[2:41:23.440 --> 2:41:29.440]  Yeah, yeah, it's just, you know, again, it's people have blinders on with certain respect to the war on drugs,
[2:41:29.440 --> 2:41:37.440]  just like they do with 9-11. So I just wanted to, you know, again, you know, for people in my hometown who might know who I am
[2:41:37.440 --> 2:41:43.440]  or what I stand for, you know, at least they might know enough about me to know that I'm not just some guy spouting off,
[2:41:43.440 --> 2:41:49.440]  that I might be a guy who actually does have educated opinions, and it might be worth their while to follow up on what I said,
[2:41:49.440 --> 2:41:51.440]  because they might learn something.
[2:41:51.440 --> 2:41:56.440]  Absolutely. Let's take some calls from Mark Stepnowski. Mark, before we do that in the last 15 or 16 minutes,
[2:41:56.440 --> 2:42:00.440]  any other points you wanted to add, anything else you wanted to point out?
[2:42:00.440 --> 2:42:07.440]  Well, I'd just like to tell people that they should make a personal commitment in their life to continue to educate themselves on these issues.
[2:42:07.440 --> 2:42:13.440]  You know, the easiest thing in the world is just to pigeonhole something and write it off, put a label on it and say,
[2:42:13.440 --> 2:42:19.440]  I don't have to look at it any further. You know, they'll just categorize it as something they don't want to know,
[2:42:19.440 --> 2:42:24.440]  and then just move on. That's the easiest thing to do. And I say intellectually, that's the lazy thing to do.
[2:42:24.440 --> 2:42:29.440]  I think people should take it upon themselves to have the initiative. If you're going to disprove something,
[2:42:29.440 --> 2:42:34.440]  if you're going to write it off, at least look into it and have an educated opinion about it.
[2:42:34.440 --> 2:42:41.440]  So I know there's a lot of nonsense out there regarding any topic, including 9-11.
[2:42:41.440 --> 2:42:43.440]  Gotcha. Go ahead.
[2:42:43.440 --> 2:42:49.440]  I would just tell people to look into anything they can, like some of the things I mentioned earlier,
[2:42:49.440 --> 2:42:58.440]  scholars from 9-11 Truth, any 9-11 Truth chapter, you know, cities all over North America have their own separate 9-11 Truth factor.
[2:42:58.440 --> 2:43:07.440]  We have a great one here in Vancouver, British Columbia, as well as Toronto and Ottawa, across Canada, just like in the States.
[2:43:07.440 --> 2:43:14.440]  I need to send you Truth Rising. We've got Canadian, U.S. 9-11 Truth. We are changes exploding.
[2:43:14.440 --> 2:43:18.440]  That new film just came out. I know you've seen Terror Storm. What did you think of that film?
[2:43:18.440 --> 2:43:24.440]  I thought it was outstanding. There are a lot of great movies out right now. There's a current one.
[2:43:24.440 --> 2:43:33.440]  People can watch on YouTube called Shadow Play, which is an excellent synopsis of the 9-11 False Flag Terror attack.
[2:43:33.440 --> 2:43:38.440]  It's a film that's coming out in segments, and they can watch those on YouTube.
[2:43:38.440 --> 2:43:44.440]  That's an excellent education for anybody who wants to kind of get a crash course on this subject.
[2:43:44.440 --> 2:43:50.440]  Well, and remember, folks, the evil people that did this are still there, and I wish they were in a cave.
[2:43:50.440 --> 2:43:54.440]  That's a lot less scary than knowing they're in control of our government.
[2:43:54.440 --> 2:44:03.440]  No question about it. I mean, we see now in a Dutch newspaper talk of an attack on Iran is imminent.
[2:44:03.440 --> 2:44:12.440]  I'm so glad to see that you're at the Democratic National Convention because people seem to think that if we get a Democrat in office, there's going to be big changes.
[2:44:12.440 --> 2:44:18.440]  But the Democratic Congress has already signed off on a preemptive nuclear attack against Iran.
[2:44:18.440 --> 2:44:19.440]  Absolutely.
[2:44:19.440 --> 2:44:25.440]  I don't know how anybody can expect anything to the contrary should Democrats be in power.
[2:44:25.440 --> 2:44:30.440]  Yeah, and again, we're not bashing either party folks. The point is, is that the corporates have taken over everything,
[2:44:30.440 --> 2:44:37.440]  and until we recognize that both parties have been taken over, we can never set about fixing the real problem if we're in that controlled paradigm.
[2:44:37.440 --> 2:44:45.440]  Again, five-time pro bowler, two-time Super Bowl champion, Mark Sipnowski is our guest, former Dallas Cowboy, Houston Euler.
[2:44:45.440 --> 2:44:53.440]  Let's go ahead and talk to Tim in New York, and then we'll go to Adam, Tim, Casey, Victor, and others.
[2:44:53.440 --> 2:44:55.440]  So go ahead. You're on the air, Tim, in New York.
[2:44:55.440 --> 2:44:59.440]  Hi, Alex and Mark. I'll give you a lot of credit for what you're doing.
[2:44:59.440 --> 2:45:07.440]  I'm involved in a situation here now where I'm experiencing my friend and girlfriend of 12 years as being soft killed as we speak.
[2:45:07.440 --> 2:45:10.440]  She has a brother that's in the State Department.
[2:45:10.440 --> 2:45:18.440]  She gave him a copy of the road to tyranny in about 2002, and ever since then, her family's really been against us.
[2:45:18.440 --> 2:45:21.440]  She was an experimental guinea pig back in 1958.
[2:45:21.440 --> 2:45:23.440]  We had her thymus radiated.
[2:45:23.440 --> 2:45:30.440]  She's always had lifelong allergies and actually a victim of sexual abuse when she was a child whose her mother brought foster kids into the house.
[2:45:30.440 --> 2:45:38.440]  On July of this year, she finally found out that she had a lot of thyroid problems and a lot of hormone deficiencies causing some memory problems.
[2:45:38.440 --> 2:45:45.440]  About a month later, her brother came home from where he works in the State Department, coerced her into going to lunch with her.
[2:45:45.440 --> 2:45:47.440]  She never came home.
[2:45:47.440 --> 2:45:54.440]  She said, as told her who's going to get her to a doctor, the next day put her into the psychiatric ward up at Strong Memorial.
[2:45:54.440 --> 2:46:00.440]  Well, sir, you need to put the names, the emails, the facts. I need to confirm this happened. I believe you, but I need to confirm it.
[2:46:00.440 --> 2:46:02.440]  That's big news. So let me stop you.
[2:46:02.440 --> 2:46:09.440]  So because she was a 9-11 truther, she's been stuck in a mental ward, and we're starting to see this happen like the old Soviet Union.
[2:46:09.440 --> 2:46:16.440]  I'm going to get your name and number off air, and then we'll have you on as a guest so I can see some documents and confirm this.
[2:46:16.440 --> 2:46:24.440]  But we have seen calls, it's in the new film, Truth Rising, all the major cable channels saying, kill Alex Jones, put him in FEMA camps.
[2:46:24.440 --> 2:46:33.440]  They're terrorists. Taser 9-11 truthers. Send them to get Moe, and they're serious. Mark Stipnowski, I mean, they're getting scared of us now.
[2:46:33.440 --> 2:46:45.440]  Yeah, no question. You'll see it across the board, you know, whether it's Geraldo Rivera or Bill Maher or any of these guys who are in a position where they have a show
[2:46:45.440 --> 2:46:56.440]  on corporate media, and the only way they're going to continue to maintain their show is to spout the lies of the current administration, you know, the corporate party line.
[2:46:56.440 --> 2:47:00.440]  Even calling for violence against us is what blows me away.
[2:47:00.440 --> 2:47:10.440]  Yeah, well, again, you know, I think St. Clair Lewis said when fascism comes to America, it'll be wrapped in the flag and carrying across.
[2:47:10.440 --> 2:47:16.440]  Yeah, that's what Ron Paul said and got in trouble. He's not saying Christians are bad. He's saying evil people will use that.
[2:47:16.440 --> 2:47:28.440]  Yeah, I mean, if that's not what we're seeing right now, I don't know what we're seeing, because, you know, we are looking at, again, the corporate ownership of both political parties.
[2:47:28.440 --> 2:47:31.440]  Again, you're wrapped in a flag carrying across.
[2:47:31.440 --> 2:47:42.440]  You know, in defense of religion and freedom, they are trying to ramrod a whole system of laws through the detriment of everybody.
[2:47:42.440 --> 2:47:48.440]  You got it, and it has nothing to do with Christianity. Adam in Texas, you're on the air with Mark Stepnosky. Go ahead.
[2:47:48.440 --> 2:48:00.440]  Hey, Mark, great to talk to you. I watched you through your career and some of the finest football I've ever seen, and I was wondering if you caught Alex up there behind the MSNBC counter.
[2:48:00.440 --> 2:48:06.440]  I wonder if you've met anybody more tenacious and more wonderful than Alex Jones.
[2:48:06.440 --> 2:48:10.440]  Oh, come on. It sounds like a setup call.
[2:48:10.440 --> 2:48:19.440]  I did see the clip online where T-Boom Pickens was being interviewed on MSNBC in the background.
[2:48:19.440 --> 2:48:24.440]  That was Minneapolis 9-11 Truth. We took over for three hours at the DNC.
[2:48:24.440 --> 2:48:33.440]  I think that's outstanding. I think, again, like we saw with Geraldo Rivera and like we saw with Bill Maher, there's going to have to continue.
[2:48:33.440 --> 2:48:42.440]  And we are changed people who do it everywhere. There has to continue to be a breakthrough into mainstream media of 9-11 Truth.
[2:48:42.440 --> 2:48:50.440]  Again, it's become obvious that we're not going to have a top-down solution to this problem. You know, the censorship is coming from top-down.
[2:48:50.440 --> 2:48:52.440]  It's going to be bottom-up.
[2:48:52.440 --> 2:48:57.440]  Exactly. It's going to have to be grassroots. And that's the beauty of the 9-11 Truth movement.
[2:48:57.440 --> 2:49:08.440]  You know, people, it's a grassroots movement. People don't have to rely on anything else other than their fellow citizens who want to get to the bottom of this to find out the truth.
[2:49:08.440 --> 2:49:12.440]  Exactly. I have to use the football analogy. What's it called? What's the term?
[2:49:12.440 --> 2:49:23.440]  The ball is moved by running, you know, just a foot at a time, a long battle down the whole field.
[2:49:23.440 --> 2:49:31.440]  Yeah, time of possession. Yeah, like you're going to ground up, you're going to eat up the clock.
[2:49:31.440 --> 2:49:33.440]  Ground war, all possession.
[2:49:33.440 --> 2:49:39.440]  Yeah, exactly. I mean, that's what this is. And we've gone like 80 yards. We've got 20 more to go. We got a first down.
[2:49:39.440 --> 2:49:44.440]  We've had all these victories. I mean, folks, we're winning. We can win this thing.
[2:49:44.440 --> 2:49:50.440]  Yeah, I think really people should, again, just concentrate on what they themselves can do.
[2:49:50.440 --> 2:49:57.440]  Don't feel powerless. Don't think like, you know, you have to accept these things, even though you don't believe them.
[2:49:57.440 --> 2:50:04.440]  Every person has it in themselves to make a decision to do what is right.
[2:50:04.440 --> 2:50:07.440]  Absolutely. Let's take another call. I'm going to skip this break, too.
[2:50:07.440 --> 2:50:11.440]  Skip the music as well for the info wars.com listeners and stations that choose to carry.
[2:50:11.440 --> 2:50:17.440]  And I'm skipping the break. Let's go ahead and talk to who's up next.
[2:50:17.440 --> 2:50:21.440]  Tim in North Carolina, you're on the air with Mark Stepnowski.
[2:50:21.440 --> 2:50:26.440]  Hey, guys, that's interesting. You came up with the football and now you're out.
[2:50:26.440 --> 2:50:29.440]  That's exactly what I was thinking about. Mark, did you play defense?
[2:50:29.440 --> 2:50:30.440]  I played offense.
[2:50:30.440 --> 2:50:32.440]  I played center.
[2:50:32.440 --> 2:50:33.440]  Yeah.
[2:50:33.440 --> 2:50:34.440]  Hello?
[2:50:34.440 --> 2:50:37.440]  He played center. He was offensive lineman.
[2:50:37.440 --> 2:50:46.440]  Offensive lineman. Well, what I was thinking was, if you're playing defense, and that's what the 9-11 thinks all about, we're defending ourselves against those guys.
[2:50:46.440 --> 2:50:53.440]  Collectors, outdoor enthusiasts, survivalists, the Army Navy store from your memory as a child is just that, on memory.
[2:50:53.440 --> 2:50:58.440]  But there is still one place to find everything from gas masks to ammo cans and find it cheap.

[2:51:47.440 --> 2:51:54.440]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[2:51:54.440 --> 2:51:58.440]  The enemy struck America on September 11th. But who is the enemy?
[2:51:58.440 --> 2:52:00.440]  bin Laden. This is his M.O.
[2:52:00.440 --> 2:52:03.440]  We have to look to the Middle East. We have to look to Osama bin Laden.
[2:52:03.440 --> 2:52:10.440]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[2:52:10.440 --> 2:52:17.440]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[2:52:17.440 --> 2:52:21.440]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[2:52:21.440 --> 2:52:40.440]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers' ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings in war games, the shadow government, and much, much more. Fabled enemies. Get the DVD at infowars.com. See it in super high quality, along with hundreds of other titles at prisonplanet.tv.
[2:52:40.440 --> 2:52:47.440]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[2:52:47.440 --> 2:52:55.440]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent? How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfate, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[2:52:55.440 --> 2:53:01.440]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[2:53:01.440 --> 2:53:12.440]  Hi, this is Alex Jones. I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.

[2:54:19.440 --> 2:54:32.440]  Well, again, I would just, you know, for those of us in Canada, I would just like again to bring up the march that the 9-11 True Society of Vancouver has orchestrated.
[2:54:32.440 --> 2:54:41.440]  It's already began. It's going to culminate in Ottawa on September 15th. I believe today there in Sudbury and Toronto, Ontario.
[2:54:41.440 --> 2:54:57.440]  These 9-11 Truthers have been traveling across the country to get petitions. They're going to march from Montreal to Ottawa and arrive on September 11th with all the signatures that they get nationwide on this petition.
[2:54:57.440 --> 2:55:09.440]  And this is for a new 9-11 investigation in Canada, because what people forget is 9-11 was, it was obviously portrayed as an attack against America, but it was a worldwide crime.
[2:55:09.440 --> 2:55:14.440]  There were citizens, I believe, from over 80 countries in the World Trade Center.
[2:55:14.440 --> 2:55:22.440]  And it totally freaks out the global controllers when we're out marching, when we don't shut up, when we don't stop. They tell us we don't have power. We know that's a lie.
[2:55:22.440 --> 2:55:30.440]  An enemy will always tell you you don't have a chance to win, folks. That's psychological warfare. We don't just have a chance. We are going to win. We are never going to stop.
[2:55:30.440 --> 2:55:36.440]  A couple final calls. Victor in Canada, speaking of Canada, you're on the air with Mark Stepnowski. Go ahead.
[2:55:36.440 --> 2:55:41.440]  Hi there. Thanks, Mark, for everything you're doing, including plugging the march on Ottawa. I'm actually from Ottawa.
[2:55:41.440 --> 2:55:48.440]  I have a comment and a question. First, my question is, what advice do you have for closet celebrity Truthers?
[2:55:48.440 --> 2:55:57.440]  I would tell them just to, instead of having a fear of the unknown, just come forward and speak the truth. Speak from your heart.
[2:55:57.440 --> 2:56:06.440]  Be honest with people. Have facts to back up your point of view. And I really think that being the case, there's nothing for people to fear.
[2:56:06.440 --> 2:56:13.440]  Hey, think about Charlie Sheen, especially with his baggage. He was the first. Think about what he did.
[2:56:13.440 --> 2:56:22.440]  People appreciate someone who's willing to come forward. I think as time goes on, people are realizing how sanitized and censored mainstream media is.
[2:56:22.440 --> 2:56:34.440]  And whether somebody is a 9-11 Truther who tells the truth or a politician who's willing to give up the talking points and just speak truthfully, people appreciate that because it's so rare.
[2:56:34.440 --> 2:56:40.440]  Absolutely. Absolutely. That's what matters in this world is conviction and honor and duty and goodness.
[2:56:40.440 --> 2:56:47.440]  And Mark Sipnowski and many others have got it. And I just love to be part of this brotherhood, this sisterhood of man, of people that stand up and have courage.
[2:56:47.440 --> 2:56:52.440]  Will Fass, Norman in North Carolina. You've got about 30 seconds.
[2:56:52.440 --> 2:56:57.440]  Hello, gentlemen. Thank you for taking my call. And thank you for keeping the truth sacred.
[2:56:57.440 --> 2:57:04.440]  I believe that if the truth can be told so as to be understood, that it will be believed. And that's what you do so well, Alex.
[2:57:04.440 --> 2:57:14.440]  And I'm proud. I'm a proud Infra-Warrior working to wake up anyone with a pulse and an attention span. And it just, it gives me a true sense of purpose and a real feeling of patriotism.
[2:57:14.440 --> 2:57:22.440]  And I'm to it that we have critical mass. And given that the news report is laughable, it's just a matter of time before we have resolutions.
[2:57:22.440 --> 2:57:24.440]  Well, God bless you guys and thank you so much.
[2:57:24.440 --> 2:57:28.440]  Absolutely. Let me be clear here at the end. We reached critical mass years ago.
[2:57:28.440 --> 2:57:34.440]  In every major poll, the majority believe that there's a cover-up, a huge portion of that majority believe inside job.
[2:57:34.440 --> 2:57:39.440]  And those are in polls when they're calling somebody up and folks usually don't answer controversially.
[2:57:39.440 --> 2:57:44.440]  We've reached critical mass. People just don't realize that the majority of us know the truth and we're scared.
[2:57:44.440 --> 2:57:50.440]  People like Mark Stepnowski stepping up the plate, that lets people see the courage and lets them know that we're not alone.
[2:57:50.440 --> 2:57:54.440]  In fact, that we're the majority. And so now we've just got to take back control of our government.
[2:57:54.440 --> 2:57:58.440]  We are the majority. Mark Stepnowski, thank you so much for spending time with us.
[2:57:58.440 --> 2:58:02.440]  I want to say bye to you on the show ends here in about 30 seconds, but anything else you want to add?
[2:58:02.440 --> 2:58:08.440]  Well, I'll say it's been nice being with you. Thanks again for the opportunity to come on. I appreciate it.
[2:58:08.440 --> 2:58:11.440]  I appreciate you. Stay right there, my friend, for 20 seconds.
[2:58:11.440 --> 2:58:15.440]  I'm going to be right there at the end to talk to you for a second, say bye to you personally.

[2:59:39.440 --> 2:59:45.440]  Waging War on Corruption. Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[2:59:45.440 --> 3:00:01.440]  Yeah. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[3:00:01.440 --> 3:00:06.440]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[3:00:06.440 --> 3:00:22.440]  Well, he testified before the House Judiciary Committee on a preliminary hearing on whether they should hear full hearings, evidence on moves to impeach George W. Bush, the president.
[3:00:22.440 --> 3:00:27.440]  And I wanted to have him on today to talk about that and go over his evidence.
[3:00:27.440 --> 3:00:37.440]  He is, of course, needs no introduction, best-selling author, the prosecutor that successfully nailed the Manson family to the wall and a bunch of other famous cases, a great legal mind.
[3:00:37.440 --> 3:00:46.440]  And the juries in, people believe, even they had Bob Barr and others up there, that he was the most effective and most powerful in the hearing last week.
[3:00:46.440 --> 3:00:49.440]  We're going to get into that, but he just now heard about this.
[3:00:49.440 --> 3:00:57.440]  He's so focused on trying to prosecute Bush and trying to get impeachment or some type of grand jury to move for indictment that he wasn't aware of this.
[3:00:57.440 --> 3:01:03.440]  And I don't blame him. This broke yesterday on Think Progress.
[3:01:03.440 --> 3:01:06.440]  There's no doubt I made phone calls last night and this morning.
[3:01:06.440 --> 3:01:24.440]  Sy Hirsch, Seymour Hirsch of the New Yorker Magazine, highly respected, White House sources, congressional sources, probably the greatest living investigative journalist who broke five years ago that U.S. Special Forces were in Iran with Wahhabist al-Qaeda-tied groups attacking the Iranian Shi'ite government.
[3:01:24.440 --> 3:01:27.440]  There's a pretext to overthrow it or start a war.
[3:01:27.440 --> 3:01:32.440]  He broke, along with the Times of London the same day, the story about the White House memo.
[3:01:32.440 --> 3:01:42.440]  He broke this two years ago, a year and a half ago, the plan to fly U.S. airplanes, paint it up like U.N. low to try to get Saddam's forces to shoot at him or shoot him down.
[3:01:42.440 --> 3:01:46.440]  But now, major breaking news.
[3:01:46.440 --> 3:01:48.440]  Major breaking news.
[3:01:48.440 --> 3:01:53.440]  And so I want to read a little bit of a report after the break to him and play a few minutes of Sy Hirsch talking about it.
[3:01:53.440 --> 3:02:05.440]  But then Poo Pooing saying, well, they just planned, you know, he just proposed chaining in a meeting, getting seals to have a bunch of arms and have a clash with destroyers and have them shoot at each other and some people could die.
[3:02:05.440 --> 3:02:07.440]  But you know, that's the high school annex.
[3:02:07.440 --> 3:02:12.440]  So we kind of poo pooed it and I find this to be really disgusting in a way.
[3:02:12.440 --> 3:02:18.440]  Vincent Boogliosi, I hate to, you know, bushwhack you here with new info, but I'm going to cover the sources for you after the break.
[3:02:18.440 --> 3:02:20.440]  But what do you think about this?
[3:02:20.440 --> 3:02:33.440]  Well, I'd have to hear it. I'm so focused on getting George Bush in an American courtroom being prosecuted for murder and taking the nation to war in Iraq on a lie that I literally, other than reading headlines, do not have time to read the daily newspapers.
[3:02:33.440 --> 3:02:37.440]  So I'm being exposed to this for the first time, but I'd like to hear it.
[3:02:37.440 --> 3:02:38.440]  Okay.
[3:02:38.440 --> 3:02:39.440]  I'd like to hear the tape of it.
[3:02:39.440 --> 3:02:41.440]  Absolutely. We're going to do that.
[3:02:41.440 --> 3:02:53.440]  I'll tell you what, John, to move that to two minutes, 20 seconds in when, when, when her starts talking on the stage, that is the best place to start this.
[3:02:53.440 --> 3:02:56.440]  And we, and we're going to go to break and some stations join us after the break.
[3:02:56.440 --> 3:02:59.440]  So that's, that's good. We'll have all our full audience then.
[3:02:59.440 --> 3:03:01.440]  But just now, let me give you the background.
[3:03:01.440 --> 3:03:04.440]  Cheney neocons considered killing Americans and pretext of attack.
[3:03:04.440 --> 3:03:07.440]  I ran think progress and other publications in the video here.
[3:03:07.440 --> 3:03:27.440]  Take to the campus of progress journalism conference earlier this month, the Pulitzer Prize winning journalist Seymour Hirsch reveals how the neocons convened around Dick Cheney and brainstormed ways to kick off World War four as they finally call their pet project to take out the Muslims and foment a contrived class of civilizations.
[3:03:27.440 --> 3:03:31.440]  Now I went and checked the conference website at the university.
[3:03:31.440 --> 3:03:32.440]  He was there.
[3:03:32.440 --> 3:03:33.440]  It is him.
[3:03:33.440 --> 3:03:36.440]  It's a video of him on the stage.
[3:03:36.440 --> 3:03:37.440]  We have called the New Yorker.
[3:03:37.440 --> 3:03:38.440]  We've called his office.
[3:03:38.440 --> 3:03:46.440]  We're trying to get a response because he has a responsibility to tell us the other 11 provocations they were planning.
[3:03:46.440 --> 3:03:47.440]  Okay.
[3:03:47.440 --> 3:03:58.440]  And it's also come out that right after this meeting was right after they had the event where they claimed that the PT Iranian boats in the Strait of Hormuz came out and wanted to attack the ship.
[3:03:58.440 --> 3:03:59.440]  Turn out they were over a mile away.
[3:03:59.440 --> 3:04:01.440]  And there was a fake radio transmission.
[3:04:01.440 --> 3:04:03.440]  The media had to admit it was fake.
[3:04:03.440 --> 3:04:12.440]  It was obviously an Anglo with a ridiculous fake Muslim voice going Eastern voice Persian voice going we are going to blow you up in one minute.
[3:04:12.440 --> 3:04:16.440]  And then it turned out quote oh somebody was joking around the Navy radios.
[3:04:16.440 --> 3:04:17.440]  Okay.
[3:04:17.440 --> 3:04:18.440]  Yeah.
[3:04:18.440 --> 3:04:19.440]  That's a cover story.
[3:04:19.440 --> 3:04:20.440]  Vincent Boogliosi.
[3:04:20.440 --> 3:04:21.440]  We're very honored to have you.
[3:04:21.440 --> 3:04:25.440]  I didn't mean to spend four minutes doing that before we have you speak.
[3:04:25.440 --> 3:04:27.440]  I just want to give you as much info.
[3:04:27.440 --> 3:04:36.440]  We'll go to a three minute break and come directly back with the full clip for Vincent Boogliosi so he can give us his take on it.
[3:04:36.440 --> 3:04:45.440]  Just unbelievable ladies and gentlemen Vincent Boogliosi is our guest stay with us.
[3:04:45.440 --> 3:04:52.440]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history a terrorist act of war against this country.
[3:04:52.440 --> 3:04:54.440]  The enemies struck America on September 11th.
[3:04:54.440 --> 3:04:56.440]  But who is the enemy?
[3:04:56.440 --> 3:04:58.440]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[3:04:58.440 --> 3:05:01.440]  We have to look to Osama bin Laden.
[3:05:01.440 --> 3:05:08.440]  Fabled enemies is the first 9 11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[3:05:08.440 --> 3:05:15.440]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[3:05:15.440 --> 3:05:19.440]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[3:05:19.440 --> 3:05:29.440]  Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government and much much more.
[3:05:29.440 --> 3:05:30.440]  Fabled enemies.

[3:05:38.440 --> 3:05:45.440]  Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists.
[3:05:45.440 --> 3:05:49.440]  Do you ever have one of those days where everything goes right?
[3:05:49.440 --> 3:05:51.440]  First I get the best parking space at work.
[3:05:51.440 --> 3:05:57.440]  Tonight I have a date with a very lovely Rachel and today I gave a killer presentation in Sydney.
[3:05:57.440 --> 3:06:01.440]  Finalized the contract in London and demoed our new product in Boston.
[3:06:01.440 --> 3:06:04.440]  Online from my desk with Webex.
[3:06:04.440 --> 3:06:07.440]  Webex lets me take meetings and give presentations from my desk.
[3:06:07.440 --> 3:06:12.440]  I just talked to clients on the phone and they watch what's happening on my desktop from their desktop.
[3:06:12.440 --> 3:06:15.440]  I'll tell the world and still be here for my date tonight with Rachel.
[3:06:44.440 --> 3:06:47.440]  Keep out of reach of children under six years of age.
[3:06:47.440 --> 3:06:53.440]  If you accidentally swallow more than used for brushing, seek professional assistance or contact a poison control center immediately.
[3:06:53.440 --> 3:06:56.440]  Why would you or your family use a product with this warning?

[3:08:02.440 --> 3:08:11.440]  During the break, because we already played it last hour, I played the audio part of the audio of the full video that's up on infoawards.com right now.
[3:08:11.440 --> 3:08:17.440]  And again, you hear Saher talk about, he's written a little article that mentioned they wanted provocations, but not what they were.
[3:08:17.440 --> 3:08:23.440]  And then the New Yorker editor said, oh, well, that's not newsworthy that they were discussing this.
[3:08:23.440 --> 3:08:32.440]  It's saying President Bush and Dick Cheney were discussing kidnapping children or cutting babies out of women's wombs like Charlie Manson.
[3:08:32.440 --> 3:08:39.440]  But they didn't do it, so we're not going to talk about it when they clearly have staged other provocations.
[3:08:39.440 --> 3:08:41.440]  This is just incredible.
[3:08:41.440 --> 3:08:48.440]  And I know Vincent Booglioz, the famous prosecutor who did prosecute the Manson family, hence the mention of Charlie Manson,
[3:08:48.440 --> 3:08:53.440]  doesn't like to get into things he hasn't fully vetted or looked at yet, but I'll play in the audio during the break.
[3:08:53.440 --> 3:08:55.440]  Give us your preliminary take on that.
[3:08:55.440 --> 3:08:58.440]  Yeah, Alex, I didn't hear everything.
[3:08:58.440 --> 3:09:00.440]  It wasn't that clear.
[3:09:00.440 --> 3:09:02.440]  I can tell you this, that it didn't surprise me at all.
[3:09:02.440 --> 3:09:04.440]  These people are capable of anything.
[3:09:04.440 --> 3:09:07.440]  By people, I mean the Bush administration.
[3:09:07.440 --> 3:09:14.440]  But I would like to have either a transcript of this meeting that took place between Cheney and Wells,
[3:09:14.440 --> 3:09:18.440]  someone having written the minutes or a memo on the meeting.
[3:09:18.440 --> 3:09:20.440]  It would be a little stronger if we had that.
[3:09:20.440 --> 3:09:26.440]  But it's totally consistent with the Manning memo that I talk about in my book,
[3:09:26.440 --> 3:09:30.440]  The Prosecution of George W. Bush for Murder, where Bush himself, not just Cheney,
[3:09:30.440 --> 3:09:34.440]  but Bush himself is talking about how to provoke a war with Saddam Hussein.
[3:09:34.440 --> 3:09:40.440]  I agree with you 100% that this is relevant, even though they didn't go ahead and do it,
[3:09:40.440 --> 3:09:43.440]  because it's reflective of their state of mind.
[3:09:43.440 --> 3:09:46.440]  And that's very important in a criminal trial.
[3:09:46.440 --> 3:09:51.440]  Their state of mind that they are willing to deliberately deceive the American public
[3:09:51.440 --> 3:09:53.440]  and take in this nation of war.
[3:09:53.440 --> 3:09:56.440]  And it also shows premeditation for dastardly deeds.
[3:09:56.440 --> 3:09:57.440]  Absolutely.
[3:09:57.440 --> 3:09:58.440]  Absolutely.
[3:09:58.440 --> 3:10:01.440]  So whether they go ahead on it or not is not relevant.
[3:10:01.440 --> 3:10:04.440]  The relevant thing is what's their state of mind that they're very willing
[3:10:04.440 --> 3:10:07.440]  to take this nation of war under false pretenses.
[3:10:07.440 --> 3:10:09.440]  Well, Vincent Bootley, obviously we're going to get into your book.
[3:10:09.440 --> 3:10:10.440]  We're going to get into the Manning memo.
[3:10:10.440 --> 3:10:12.440]  I want you to spend some time on that first, since it does dovetail.
[3:10:12.440 --> 3:10:16.440]  But as a famous, highly respected prosecutor and legal scholar,
[3:10:16.440 --> 3:10:20.440]  if I met with 10 guys and discussed 12 different crimes,
[3:10:20.440 --> 3:10:26.440]  and we're seriously thinking about implementing them, isn't that a crime in and of itself?
[3:10:26.440 --> 3:10:27.440]  Not really.
[3:10:27.440 --> 3:10:29.440]  It comes pretty close to it.
[3:10:29.440 --> 3:10:35.440]  Well, you could say yes, a conspiracy to commit the crime, except at common law, that was enough.
[3:10:35.440 --> 3:10:40.440]  But today, in addition to the agreement, there has to be what they call an overact,
[3:10:40.440 --> 3:10:42.440]  a step taken.
[3:10:42.440 --> 3:10:47.440]  It doesn't have to be a big step, but a step taken to carry out the object of the conspiracy.
[3:10:47.440 --> 3:10:50.440]  So there is the agreement, which is one element of the crime of conspiracy.
[3:10:50.440 --> 3:10:58.440]  But here, if that's all there was, there was no overact to further what they were agreeing to do.
[3:10:58.440 --> 3:11:01.440]  But it's enough for a major investigation, is it not?
[3:11:01.440 --> 3:11:02.440]  Absolutely.
[3:11:02.440 --> 3:11:03.440]  Absolutely.
[3:11:03.440 --> 3:11:04.440]  Absolutely.
[3:11:04.440 --> 3:11:07.440]  Of course, it shows that they want to take the nation to war on a live.
[3:11:07.440 --> 3:11:12.440]  But there has to be some step that they take in furtherance of the object of that agreement.
[3:11:12.440 --> 3:11:16.440]  And I don't hear that here, even in the Manning Memo, we don't have that.
[3:11:16.440 --> 3:11:21.440]  But we do have Bush showing that he wanted to take the nation to war on a live.
[3:11:21.440 --> 3:11:22.440]  Tell us about the Manning Memo.
[3:11:22.440 --> 3:11:25.440]  I mean, not everybody is aware of it like you are in a book about it.
[3:11:25.440 --> 3:11:26.440]  Tell us about it.
[3:11:26.440 --> 3:11:31.440]  Well, the Manning Memo is just one piece of evidence that I present in my book to show
[3:11:31.440 --> 3:11:34.440]  that George Bush is guilty of murder.
[3:11:34.440 --> 3:11:38.440]  And it shows the state of mind that he wanted to go to war on a live.
[3:11:38.440 --> 3:11:41.440]  The date was January the 31st, 2003.
[3:11:41.440 --> 3:11:43.440]  And by the way, we're not talking about the Downing Street Memo.
[3:11:43.440 --> 3:11:44.440]  No, that's a totally different memo.
[3:11:44.440 --> 3:11:45.440]  And it's kind of ambiguous.
[3:11:45.440 --> 3:11:47.440]  And if I prosecuted Bush, that would be offered.
[3:11:47.440 --> 3:11:49.440]  But it's not strong enough to go to war.
[3:11:49.440 --> 3:11:51.440]  I mean, to go to a trial.
[3:11:51.440 --> 3:11:54.440]  Yeah, that's telling the British fixed intelligence we're going to lie.
[3:11:54.440 --> 3:11:58.440]  Yeah, but there was no source for that.
[3:11:58.440 --> 3:12:01.440]  And it's a little ambiguous what fixing the evidence means.
[3:12:01.440 --> 3:12:05.440]  It could mean creating evidence, which would be very, very serious.
[3:12:05.440 --> 3:12:08.440]  Or it could mean cherry picking, which is a lot weaker.
[3:12:08.440 --> 3:12:11.440]  But the Manning Memo, this is January 31st, 2003.
[3:12:11.440 --> 3:12:18.440]  Bush met with British Prime Minister Tony Blair in the Oval Office for two hours with six of his top aides,
[3:12:18.440 --> 3:12:23.440]  including Blair's Chief Foreign Policy Advisor, David Manning.
[3:12:23.440 --> 3:12:28.440]  After the meeting, Manning prepared a five-page memo stamped, quote,
[3:12:28.440 --> 3:12:33.440]  extremely sensitive, unquote, in which he summarized, Alex, what was said at the meeting.
[3:12:33.440 --> 3:12:38.440]  And among other things, he said that George Bush, not Blair, but Bush,
[3:12:38.440 --> 3:12:44.440]  was so worried about the failure of UN inspectors to find weapons of mass destruction in Iraq
[3:12:44.440 --> 3:12:47.440]  that he talked about three possible ways to, quote,
[3:12:47.440 --> 3:12:52.440]  provoke a confrontation, unquote, with Hussein, one of which, Bush said,
[3:12:52.440 --> 3:12:59.440]  was to, quote, fly U-2 reconnaissance aircraft over Iraq falsely painted in United Nations colors.
[3:12:59.440 --> 3:13:05.440]  And Bush said that if Hussein fired upon them, he'd be in violation of UN resolutions,
[3:13:05.440 --> 3:13:07.440]  and that would justify our going to war.
[3:13:07.440 --> 3:13:14.440]  Now, here we have Alex George Bush telling the American people, telling the world
[3:13:14.440 --> 3:13:18.440]  that Hussein was an imminent threat to the security of this country,
[3:13:18.440 --> 3:13:25.440]  but behind closed doors, this small man was talking about how to provoke Hussein into a war.
[3:13:25.440 --> 3:13:29.440]  Now, if Bush, honestly, and let's italicize the word, honestly,
[3:13:29.440 --> 3:13:33.440]  if he honestly believed that Hussein was an imminent threat to security of this country,
[3:13:33.440 --> 3:13:36.440]  which is the main reason he gave the American people going to war,
[3:13:36.440 --> 3:13:43.440]  by definition, the thought of provoking Hussein into a war would never, ever have entered his mind.
[3:13:43.440 --> 3:13:46.440]  I was on the Dennis Moore Show a couple of weeks ago.
[3:13:46.440 --> 3:13:50.440]  Dennis fell hopelessly in love with the Republican Party at the time of 9-11,
[3:13:50.440 --> 3:13:52.440]  and I poked fun of him in my book.
[3:13:52.440 --> 3:13:57.440]  And I said, Dennis, you're defending George Bush at his trial for murder,
[3:13:57.440 --> 3:14:00.440]  and the prosecutor calls David Manning to the witness stand to testify
[3:14:00.440 --> 3:14:03.440]  to what your guys said on January 31, 2003.
[3:14:03.440 --> 3:14:06.440]  Other than trying to hide beneath the console table, Dennis,
[3:14:06.440 --> 3:14:10.440]  what would your response be to David Manning's testimony?
[3:14:10.440 --> 3:14:12.440]  And Dennis is bright and quick.
[3:14:12.440 --> 3:14:14.440]  He said, I'd ask for a recess.
[3:14:14.440 --> 3:14:20.440]  No matter how long that recess went on, for 10 minutes an hour, a week, or a year,
[3:14:20.440 --> 3:14:24.440]  there's no answer to the Manning memo other than guilt.
[3:14:24.440 --> 3:14:29.440]  It clearly shows George Bush wanting to take the nation to war on a lie.
[3:14:29.440 --> 3:14:33.440]  The fact that they didn't implement that is not relevant.
[3:14:33.440 --> 3:14:36.440]  It's relevant in that we couldn't prosecute it on that alone.
[3:14:36.440 --> 3:14:40.440]  But it shows that he lied when he told the nation that he believed
[3:14:40.440 --> 3:14:43.440]  that Hussein was an imminent threat to security of this country.
[3:14:43.440 --> 3:14:46.440]  I believe that he never, by definition, would have been talking about
[3:14:46.440 --> 3:14:48.440]  how to provoke Hussein into a war.
[3:14:48.440 --> 3:14:52.440]  And he then had his surrogates go out and produce excised, as you covered
[3:14:52.440 --> 3:14:57.440]  in the hearings last week, before the judiciary, false, dumbied-up reports
[3:14:57.440 --> 3:15:01.440]  that had then been brought to Congress and before the United Nations.
[3:15:01.440 --> 3:15:05.440]  So he had his surrogates all over, pushing a lie, and then took us to the war.
[3:15:05.440 --> 3:15:12.440]  Yeah. In fact, on June 16th, I got a call here in L.A. from a very conservative
[3:15:12.440 --> 3:15:16.440]  Republican congressman from the South who voted for the war,
[3:15:16.440 --> 3:15:19.440]  was one of its most vocal supporters.
[3:15:19.440 --> 3:15:22.440]  I'm not giving his name right now because he's running for reelection,
[3:15:22.440 --> 3:15:26.440]  but he told me that come November, he wants to be on my side,
[3:15:26.440 --> 3:15:29.440]  hopefully when George Bush is indicted for murder, in any event.
[3:15:29.440 --> 3:15:34.440]  He heard the tape on the book, The Prosecution of George W. Bush for Murder,
[3:15:34.440 --> 3:15:38.440]  and he called me and said, Mr. Bush, I want to tell you that I'm convinced now
[3:15:38.440 --> 3:15:42.440]  that George Bush misled Congress, he didn't mention the American people,
[3:15:42.440 --> 3:15:44.440]  to mislead Congress into war.
[3:15:44.440 --> 3:15:49.440]  I've given several copies of the book to colleagues, including John Conyers,
[3:15:49.440 --> 3:15:53.440]  who called me, by the way, about a month ago, or three weeks ago,
[3:15:53.440 --> 3:15:56.440]  or I forget how long ago, but anyway, he said he was reading the book
[3:15:56.440 --> 3:15:59.440]  and he'd gotten a copy of the book.
[3:15:59.440 --> 3:16:04.440]  And he said that, where am I here on this story here?
[3:16:04.440 --> 3:16:09.440]  I'm talking about this Republican Congressman.
[3:16:09.440 --> 3:16:12.440]  He said he's given them a copy of the book, asked them to read it,
[3:16:12.440 --> 3:16:16.440]  and told them, read the book, we were lied to.
[3:16:16.440 --> 3:16:21.440]  He felt very bad himself that he was susceptible to that lie,
[3:16:21.440 --> 3:16:25.440]  and I told him, Congressman, do not feel that way.
[3:16:25.440 --> 3:16:27.440]  You were not, as he learned in the book,
[3:16:27.440 --> 3:16:29.440]  you were not given the information that you were supposed to be given.
[3:16:29.440 --> 3:16:31.440]  Now, what is that information?
[3:16:31.440 --> 3:16:38.440]  Well, Bush, on the evening of October the 7th, 2002, from Cincinnati, Ohio,
[3:16:38.440 --> 3:16:42.440]  this was his first reference to Hussein in Iraq being a threat to the country.
[3:16:42.440 --> 3:16:49.440]  He told the nation that Hussein was an imminent threat to the security of this country,
[3:16:49.440 --> 3:16:52.440]  either by his attacking us with weapons of mass destruction,
[3:16:52.440 --> 3:16:56.440]  or giving those weapons to a terrorist group to attack us.
[3:16:56.440 --> 3:17:03.440]  He said this attack can happen, quote, on any given day, unquote, meaning the threat was imminent.
[3:17:03.440 --> 3:17:08.440]  The big problem for George Bush is that the evidence shows that what he told the American people
[3:17:08.440 --> 3:17:15.440]  was the exact opposite of what his own CIA had told him just six days earlier
[3:17:15.440 --> 3:17:21.440]  in a classified October 1st report that Hussein was not an imminent threat.
[3:17:21.440 --> 3:17:26.440]  Now we get into the issue of deletions, and it gets worse.
[3:17:26.440 --> 3:17:32.440]  October the 4th, and I told Congress this, and they were taking notes that looked like to me.
[3:17:32.440 --> 3:17:35.440]  If they weren't taking notes, they were certainly listening very intently.
[3:17:35.440 --> 3:17:40.440]  In fact, Conyers, the fellow to his left, Republican Congressman, literally tried to shut me down,
[3:17:40.440 --> 3:17:42.440]  and he made this remark.
[3:17:42.440 --> 3:17:43.440]  Lamar Smith.
[3:17:43.440 --> 3:17:51.440]  He said, I'm not referring to me, but he said I'm about to have an aneurysm.
[3:17:51.440 --> 3:17:54.440]  Now I don't know if that was a Freudian slip or what have you,
[3:17:54.440 --> 3:18:06.440]  but I told Congress that in this October 4th unclassified version of the classified report,
[3:18:06.440 --> 3:18:08.440]  it was called the White Paper.
[3:18:08.440 --> 3:18:10.440]  This is what the Bush administration did.
[3:18:10.440 --> 3:18:16.440]  They had an unclassified summary version of October 1st report to give to Congress and the American people.
[3:18:16.440 --> 3:18:21.440]  In this unclassified version, the conclusion of US intelligence,
[3:18:21.440 --> 3:18:26.440]  we're talking about 16 US intelligence agencies led by the CIA.
[3:18:26.440 --> 3:18:32.440]  The conclusion of US intelligence that Hussein was not an imminent threat to the security of this country
[3:18:32.440 --> 3:18:34.440]  was completely deleted.
[3:18:34.440 --> 3:18:39.440]  Every single one of those all-important words was taken out, so Congress never saw that.
[3:18:39.440 --> 3:18:45.440]  And I was telling this Congressman, as he learned from the book, you never saw that.
[3:18:45.440 --> 3:18:49.440]  I can't tell you how serious this is.
[3:18:49.440 --> 3:18:55.440]  Those who don't understand, they premeditatedly edited the 16 agencies reports,
[3:18:55.440 --> 3:19:01.440]  created a fraud, and then put it forward as 16 unanimous agencies saying he is a threat
[3:19:01.440 --> 3:19:03.440]  when they said he isn't an imminent threat.
[3:19:03.440 --> 3:19:05.440]  Yeah, that's exactly right.
[3:19:05.440 --> 3:19:14.440]  The consensus of 16 US intelligence agencies was that Hussein was not an imminent threat to this country,
[3:19:14.440 --> 3:19:17.440]  but the White Paper that was given to Congress just seven days,
[3:19:17.440 --> 3:19:23.440]  just seven days before Congress voted on whether to authorize George Bush to go to war, October 11th,
[3:19:23.440 --> 3:19:25.440]  did not contain that statement.
[3:19:25.440 --> 3:19:27.440]  It did not contain several other things.
[3:19:27.440 --> 3:19:31.440]  And when we get back, I'd like to talk to you about several other things that were not inevitable.
[3:19:31.440 --> 3:19:35.440]  Absolutely. Vincent Boogley, oh, see, he's our guest, the famed prosecutor.
[3:19:35.440 --> 3:19:38.440]  He says he's got the goods. George Bush is a mass murderer.
[3:19:38.440 --> 3:19:40.440]  That's the facts. We'll be right back.
[3:19:45.440 --> 3:19:49.440]  As many people know, ever since President Nixon took us off the gold standard,
[3:19:49.440 --> 3:19:51.440]  the US dollar has been evaluating.
[3:19:51.440 --> 3:19:54.440]  What people don't know, however, is how this directly affects your personal finances.
[3:19:54.440 --> 3:19:57.440]  Is there a way to prevent your portfolios from losing value?
[3:19:57.440 --> 3:19:59.440]  The answer to all of this is gold and silver.
[3:19:59.440 --> 3:20:02.440]  They've both maintained their purchasing power for 6,000 years.
[3:20:02.440 --> 3:20:09.440]  If you had had $100,000 in cash and $100,000 in gold and silver back in 1913,
[3:20:09.440 --> 3:20:15.440]  and kept them both until now, your cash would actually have the buying power of only $4,800.
[3:20:15.440 --> 3:20:18.440]  But your gold and silver would have the buying power of $3 million.
[3:20:18.440 --> 3:20:20.440]  The answer to protecting your assets is simple.
[3:20:20.440 --> 3:20:28.440]  Call me, John Ballman, today at 1-800-686-2237, extension 169.

[3:20:39.440 --> 3:20:44.440]  That's 1-800-686-2237, extension 169.
[3:20:44.440 --> 3:20:47.440]  May I have everybody's attention, please?
[3:20:47.440 --> 3:20:52.440]  I've come with a message of information. 9-11 was an inside job.
[3:20:52.440 --> 3:20:55.440]  Do you like being a puppet, sir? Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[3:20:55.440 --> 3:20:58.440]  The American people know that 9-11 was the state.
[3:20:58.440 --> 3:21:02.440]  It was engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the fallout or commission, the CAF.
[3:21:02.440 --> 3:21:11.440]  The day that we stop asking questions is the day that we have allowed the seeds of despotism to grow at our own door.
[3:21:11.440 --> 3:21:17.440]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11, a global awakening has taken place.
[3:21:17.440 --> 3:21:21.440]  An inside job? How dare you?
[3:21:21.440 --> 3:21:27.440]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[3:21:27.440 --> 3:21:30.440]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[3:21:30.440 --> 3:21:55.440]  If the government has not told the truth in five years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of life.

[3:23:51.440 --> 3:23:56.440]  Famed prosecutor of the Manson family in many other famous cases, best-selling author.
[3:23:56.440 --> 3:24:00.440]  Vincent Bugliozzi is our guest the rest of the hour.
[3:24:00.440 --> 3:24:06.440]  We're going to open the phones up about the impeachment hearings last week about where all this is going.
[3:24:06.440 --> 3:24:14.440]  I also want to ask him later, is he fearing for his safety going up against this mafia and has he got any threats?
[3:24:14.440 --> 3:24:21.440]  But continuing with the absolute evidence that, I mean, you use the number of 100,000 dead in Iraq,
[3:24:21.440 --> 3:24:29.440]  but most of the big, the lands that study and other international respected groups were nonpartisan
[3:24:29.440 --> 3:24:35.440]  have said that it's closer to a million now. I mean, two and a half years ago, it was 600,000 plus dead.
[3:24:35.440 --> 3:24:43.440]  But being conservative, 100,000 dead in Iraq, I mean, this is murder. This is premeditated. Please continue.
[3:24:43.440 --> 3:24:48.440]  Of course, by the way, Alex, in my end note, a lot of times people don't read end notes,
[3:24:48.440 --> 3:24:53.440]  but my end notes are a little different than a lot of people. Some of my end notes go on for 20, 30 pages
[3:24:53.440 --> 3:24:59.440]  in my book on the Kennedy assassination. I have an end note that goes on for 60 pages, I think, with about 30 foot notes.
[3:24:59.440 --> 3:25:03.440]  I'm not dropping names here, but Johnny Carson said, Vince, I read all your end notes,
[3:25:03.440 --> 3:25:09.440]  but the only reason I mention that now is I do mention what you say about the estimates being as high as one million,
[3:25:09.440 --> 3:25:17.440]  and that was about a year ago. So I'm using a very conservative number in the main text of a 100,000.
[3:25:17.440 --> 3:25:24.440]  Summarizing what I'm saying up to where we left off, we have Bush then telling the nation on October the 7th
[3:25:24.440 --> 3:25:31.440]  that Hussein was an imminent threat to security of this country, and he was telling millions of unsuspecting Americans
[3:25:31.440 --> 3:25:38.440]  the exact opposite of what his own CIA had told them just six days earlier, that Hussein was not an imminent threat.
[3:25:38.440 --> 3:25:45.440]  And then I was pointing out to you that on October the 4th, the Bush administration put out an unclassified summary version
[3:25:45.440 --> 3:25:50.440]  of this classified report so they could give it to Congress and the American people, and this report was called a white paper.
[3:25:50.440 --> 3:25:58.440]  And in that white paper, the main conclusion of the October 1st classified report that Hussein was not an imminent threat
[3:25:58.440 --> 3:26:03.440]  was completely deleted, so Congress and the American people did not see that.
[3:26:03.440 --> 3:26:09.440]  There were two other things in that classified report that Congress and the American people never saw,
[3:26:09.440 --> 3:26:14.440]  and the Republican congressman saw it for the first time in the book.
[3:26:14.440 --> 3:26:20.440]  One, the conclusion, it was an erroneous conclusion that Hussein had weapons of mass destruction.
[3:26:20.440 --> 3:26:25.440]  We subsequently learned that they were all destroyed in 1991 at the end of the Persian Gulf War.
[3:26:25.440 --> 3:26:30.440]  That conclusion was stated in the classified report as an opinion with the words,
[3:26:30.440 --> 3:26:35.440]  we assess that, or we judge that, Hussein has weapons of mass destruction.
[3:26:35.440 --> 3:26:41.440]  The white report, the white paper, the words we judge that we assess that were deleted,
[3:26:41.440 --> 3:26:44.440]  and that opinion was stated as a fact.
[3:26:44.440 --> 3:26:47.440]  The words were, Hussein has weapons of mass destruction.
[3:26:47.440 --> 3:26:55.440]  Also, there were several very important defense in the area of nuclear weapons in the classified report.
[3:26:55.440 --> 3:26:59.440]  All of those defense were deleted from the white paper.
[3:26:59.440 --> 3:27:05.440]  This is extremely powerful evidence that Bush took this nation to war knowingly and deliberately on a lie,
[3:27:05.440 --> 3:27:11.440]  under false pretenses, and therefore, under the law, he's guilty of murder
[3:27:11.440 --> 3:27:15.440]  for the death of over 4,000 young American soldiers who have died so far fighting his war,
[3:27:15.440 --> 3:27:19.440]  not your war, Alex, or my war, or America's war, but his war.
[3:27:19.440 --> 3:27:24.440]  One of the key issues that I knew would come up, if there's going to be a prosecution,
[3:27:24.440 --> 3:27:28.440]  and there very well could be after he leaves office, right now he has temporary immunity,
[3:27:28.440 --> 3:27:32.440]  is whether there's jurisdiction to prosecute George Bush.
[3:27:32.440 --> 3:27:36.440]  I spent a great number of hours at the LA County Law Library, the Ninth Circuit Library,
[3:27:36.440 --> 3:27:38.440]  trying to establish jurisdiction.
[3:27:38.440 --> 3:27:43.440]  I was unable to establish jurisdiction for the well over 100,000 innocent Iraqi men,
[3:27:43.440 --> 3:27:46.440]  women, children, and babies who have died in his war.
[3:27:46.440 --> 3:27:49.440]  Bush is guilty of those murders, but I couldn't establish jurisdiction for them.
[3:27:49.440 --> 3:27:57.440]  But I was able to establish jurisdiction to prosecute Bush for the murder of the over 4,000 young American soldiers.
[3:27:57.440 --> 3:28:03.440]  And I established jurisdiction for the Attorney General in Washington, D.C., acting through his Department of Justice.
[3:28:03.440 --> 3:28:06.440]  We're only talking really about one prosecutor there.
[3:28:06.440 --> 3:28:11.440]  There's 93 U.S. attorneys around the country, but they're not going to bring an action against Bush without the consent of their boss.
[3:28:11.440 --> 3:28:18.440]  But on a state level, I established jurisdiction for the Attorney General in each of the 50 states,
[3:28:18.440 --> 3:28:24.440]  plus the approximately 950 district attorneys in counties within those states,
[3:28:24.440 --> 3:28:32.440]  to prosecute Bush for the murder of any soldier or soldiers from their state or county who died fighting Bush's war in Iraq.
[3:28:32.440 --> 3:28:37.440]  So with over or approximately 1,000 prosecutors out there in this land of ours,
[3:28:37.440 --> 3:28:43.440]  and with all the evidence of guilt that I present in my book, The Prosecution of George Bush for Murder,
[3:28:43.440 --> 3:28:49.440]  I don't think it's unreasonable to believe, Alex, that there's at least one prosecutor out there that's courageous enough to step forward.
[3:28:49.440 --> 3:28:51.440]  Maybe there's many more.
[3:28:51.440 --> 3:28:54.440]  Step forward and say, this is the United States of America.
[3:28:54.440 --> 3:28:57.440]  In America, no man is above the law.
[3:28:57.440 --> 3:29:01.440]  The evidence of Bush's guilt is clear, so I'm going to go after him.
[3:29:01.440 --> 3:29:08.440]  And when we talk about 1,000 prosecutors, before Bush passes away, that number may go up to 7,000 or 8,000 prosecutors,
[3:29:08.440 --> 3:29:11.440]  because there's no statute of limitations for the crime of murder.
[3:29:11.440 --> 3:29:18.440]  You know, Pinochet down in Chile, 33 years later, they brought murder charges against him.
[3:29:18.440 --> 3:29:22.440]  Stay there, Vincent Booglio. See, I want to talk about what's happening now.
[3:29:22.440 --> 3:29:27.440]  They're cornered rats. They need a new war.
[3:29:27.440 --> 3:29:35.440]  If, getting in the mind of the criminals, what do you think they're planning to do to stop your investigation and others' investigations?
[3:29:35.440 --> 3:29:39.440]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run.
[3:29:39.440 --> 3:29:45.440]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[3:29:45.440 --> 3:29:52.440]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[3:29:52.440 --> 3:29:56.440]  The enemy struck America on September 11th. But who is the enemy?
[3:29:56.440 --> 3:29:58.440]  Ben Laden. This is his ammo.
[3:29:58.440 --> 3:30:01.440]  We have to look to the Middle East. We have to look to Osama Ben Laden.
[3:30:01.440 --> 3:30:08.440]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[3:30:08.440 --> 3:30:15.440]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis, again, very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[3:30:15.440 --> 3:30:19.440]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[3:30:19.440 --> 3:30:29.440]  Ben Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers' ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings in war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[3:30:29.440 --> 3:30:38.440]  Fabled Enemies. Get the DVD at infowars.com, or see it in super high quality, along with hundreds of other titles at prisonplanet.tv.
[3:30:38.440 --> 3:30:45.440]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[3:30:45.440 --> 3:30:52.440]  I had the opportunity to speak to my 90-year-old grandmother at some length here recently, and she was talking about the Great Depression.
[3:30:52.440 --> 3:30:58.440]  And we were talking about the gas prices, the food prices, this economic uncertainty we're in these, you know, really kind of perilous times.
[3:30:58.440 --> 3:31:00.440]  No one knows where we're headed or where we might end up.
[3:31:00.440 --> 3:31:08.440]  And she was reminded of the Great Depression and how in those days, folks who lived in the country did okay because they had chicken and eggs, and they could grow gardens and can their food.
[3:31:08.440 --> 3:31:16.440]  But how difficult it was for people who lived in urban areas or in the cities, because they didn't have the landscape for gardening or the know-how, and they didn't have the chickens and the livestock.
[3:31:16.440 --> 3:31:17.440]  So it's a lot different for them.
[3:31:17.440 --> 3:31:23.440]  Well, we know one thing's certain right now. We're headed into much higher prices on food, and there is a global food shortage.

[3:32:44.440 --> 3:33:00.440]  Before you slip into unconsciousness, I'd like to have another kiss.
[3:33:00.440 --> 3:33:15.440]  He had the highest conviction rate in violent felony cases in L.A. County when he was prosecutor there.
[3:33:15.440 --> 3:33:31.440]  He's Vincent Bugliozzi, best-selling author of books he's written and made into films, TV shows, you name it.
[3:33:31.440 --> 3:33:47.440]  The control psychopaths go for positions of power throughout history, comparing the mind of Charlie Manson and other psychos you put away with George Bush, with Cheney, with the neocons, with their nasty mindset.
[3:33:47.440 --> 3:33:51.440]  Give us your analysis on their mindset.
[3:33:51.440 --> 3:34:02.440]  Well, I don't know if I have an authority on the mindset. I had to prove that the defendant committed the crime and that there was no legal justification for him to do so.
[3:34:02.440 --> 3:34:07.440]  We certainly got into the mind in the resolution of that issue.
[3:34:07.440 --> 3:34:26.440]  But motive is not an element of the corpus delicti of any crime. So I've actually put people on death row without knowing for sure why they committed the crime. All I knew is that they had done it, put someone in their grave six feet under and they had no legal justification for doing so, but you're asking me kind of to compare Manson with Bush.
[3:34:26.440 --> 3:34:45.440]  Manson obviously was a very evil person. Let me get that off the hook here so we're not interrupted. Manson was a very evil person who wanted to kill as many people as he could, and I knew that if he was not stopped, he would have killed as many people as he could have.
[3:34:45.440 --> 3:35:07.440]  Someone who knew Manson a lot better than I did because he lived with him, little Paul Watkins. He's dead now. He said, Ben's death is Charlie's trip. So I would classify Manson as being a very evil human being who placed no value on human life and he had a passion for death, blood, and murder.
[3:35:07.440 --> 3:35:25.440]  Bush, I would not say is evil. He certainly doesn't want to kill anyone, but he's a despicable human being who couldn't care less when people do die. He's extremely arrogant, extremely self-centered.
[3:35:25.440 --> 3:35:43.440]  One of the emotional underpinnings for this book, basically, is the fact that, and we're getting into this issue now, that he couldn't possibly care less about the fact that his own people were being killed or the death of innocent Iraqi civilians.
[3:35:43.440 --> 3:36:01.440]  One of the emotional underpinnings for my book is the fact that the evidence is overwhelming that throughout the hell on earth that Bush created in Iraq with over 100,000 people dying horrible violent deaths and hundreds of thousands of their survivors crying out hysterically and having terrible nightmares over what happened to their loved ones.
[3:36:01.440 --> 3:36:12.440]  This guy, George Bush, has smiled through it all. In fact, if you see a photo of Bush and six or seven other people smiling, Alex, who has the biggest smile on his face right in the middle of the war, George Bush.
[3:36:12.440 --> 3:36:29.440]  The evidence is very clear and anyone that tries to dispute it is just going to be looking like a fool that while young American soldiers, 18, 19-year-old kids, Alex, who never had a chance to live out their dreams were being blown to pieces by roadside bombs in Iraq,
[3:36:29.440 --> 3:36:46.440]  Bush was having a lot of fun and enjoying life to the very fullest. I'm talking about running, bicycling, joking with friends, slapping backs, dancing and swiveling his hips like Elvis to blaring music, almost always appearing to be in the very best of good spirits.
[3:36:46.440 --> 3:37:01.440]  Exactly. Let me just stop you, Vince Pugliozzi. I mean, just covering serious issues on the show, I've become more of a serious person and very serious in life and you see a judge, they try to be solemn, you see police, they try to be professional and solemn.
[3:37:01.440 --> 3:37:14.440]  With Bush, he's always clowning around and then he lied and said, oh, I haven't been playing golf since the war started and it turns out he's playing every week. So it's also the endless lying and just the arrogance thinking we're all idiots.
[3:37:14.440 --> 3:37:30.440]  Yeah, you look at a photograph of people like or a president like Roosevelt, Truman, LBJ and Nixon, a photograph of their faces during the time of war, their respective wars, and the photos reflect the grimness of the war.
[3:37:30.440 --> 3:37:42.440]  There's a very serious time. Unlike any other president in American history, during a time of war, Bush has regularly and routinely had a lot of fun and been in high spirits.
[3:37:42.440 --> 3:37:55.440]  You can say what you want. You can say what you want about Nixon or LBJ, but they obsessed in the war room and tried to figure things out and got ulcers and lost sleep and these weren't even very immoral people in many respects, but they took it serious.
[3:37:55.440 --> 3:38:05.440]  Oh, absolutely. LBJ told one of his aides, Jack Valenti, that every time in the morning when he agreed to casually report, it was like drinking our carbolic acid.
[3:38:05.440 --> 3:38:14.440]  And for your audience out there, I would tell them that they don't have to take my word for this or the photographs in the book and they're not gotcha photos. They're photos showing Bush having an absolute ball.
[3:38:14.440 --> 3:38:25.440]  Bush himself has had no hesitancy at all in saying things like this over and over again. And while I'm quoting Bush, these are just some quotes that are in the book.
[3:38:25.440 --> 3:38:42.440]  While I'm quoting him, try to think, I'm asking your audience, you try to think of at the very same time he's uttering these words, all of the death and the horror and the suffering and the screaming and the mutilations of beheadings that are taking place in Iraq while he's uttering these words.
[3:38:42.440 --> 3:38:54.440]  This is George Bush. Laura and I are having the time of our lives. I'm in a great mood. It's a perfect day. I'm feeling pretty good about life.
[3:38:54.440 --> 3:39:01.440]  Alex, if I killed one person, even accidentally, like in a car accident, I'd never have another perfect day for the rest of my life.
[3:39:01.440 --> 3:39:06.440]  And I'm telling you, this guy has been having a ball and joined himself to the utmost throughout this entire war.
[3:39:06.440 --> 3:39:25.440]  And I say this, that even if George Bush was only guilty of making an innocent mistake and taking this nation to war in Iraq, not murder, as I firmly believe, with all of the death, horror and suffering he has caused, what type of a monstrous individual is it who could be happy with his life?
[3:39:25.440 --> 3:39:36.440]  And there's no question that he's happy. I mean, as recently as March of this year, he shows up at a press conference to endorse McCain's candidacy. McCain shows up late. What does Bush do?
[3:39:36.440 --> 3:39:47.440]  Spontaneously, a big smile on his face. He starts doing a soft shoe tap dancing routine to entertain the assembled media. You've probably heard of Mark McKinnon.
[3:39:47.440 --> 3:39:58.440]  Yes. Well, he's a bicycling friend of Bush and I think he was ahead of Bush's media campaign or one of his strategists. I think he was ahead of it.
[3:39:58.440 --> 3:40:11.440]  In the 2004 Relaxing Campaign, he told the New York Times in 2005, right in the midst of all the horror and atrocities going on in Iraq, he says he's never seen the president more calm, relaxed and happy.
[3:40:11.440 --> 3:40:26.440]  And to me, this is almost unprecedented. I kind of went off on a little riff. You're asking me to compare Manson with Bush. Bush is a despicable human being. I don't believe he's lost one wink of sleep over all the deaths that he's caused in Iraq.
[3:40:26.440 --> 3:40:33.440]  Well, what about the working out three hours a day and taking two hour naps and then says he doesn't even read the newspaper?
[3:40:33.440 --> 3:40:42.440]  Oh, yeah. Yeah. Probably even more telling than all of this. My wife and I, during a seven year period, I work seven days a week. I get to bed around two in the morning.
[3:40:42.440 --> 3:40:52.440]  Wake up at 10. She says you work from morning to morning. We had our 50th anniversary and we took three days off in the desert during a seven year period that Bush was president.
[3:40:52.440 --> 3:41:03.440]  It hadn't been for the anniversary. Probably wouldn't even taken those three days off. Now, the only reason I mentioned that is that I'm, you know, a cipher, a complete nobody. I'm just an author.
[3:41:03.440 --> 3:41:12.440]  During that same period, you know how many days George Bush took off for vacation or at places like Kind of Bunkport.
[3:41:12.440 --> 3:41:22.440]  Well, I know it's around a third of the year he's on vacation. Yeah, that's right. 908 days. So I take three days off and I'm nothing. He's the president of the United States.
[3:41:22.440 --> 3:41:32.440]  And I was told by the CBS radio guy who follows the White House that up until January 1, 2008, he had taken off 908 days on vacation.
[3:41:32.440 --> 3:41:40.440]  Here's someone that's not particularly bright at all. Everyone agrees, even his supporters, that he has an extremely low amount of knowledge.
[3:41:40.440 --> 3:41:48.440]  If you were to take the average person and put them in the presidency with Bush's lack of knowledge, what would that person do if he loved America?
[3:41:48.440 --> 3:41:59.440]  He'd work round the clock trying to get as knowledgeable as he could so he could represent this country in the best possible way to bring it to a better condition than it presently is in.
[3:41:59.440 --> 3:42:10.440]  George Bush did the exact opposite, took off 908 days. Why? Well, like I say in the book, it doesn't just show he's lazy. Everyone knows that. It shows that.
[3:42:10.440 --> 3:42:18.440]  It shows, in my opinion, I'm not positive of this, that this man does not love the United States of America. He doesn't hate it. He doesn't hate it.
[3:42:18.440 --> 3:42:26.440]  But he has no particular love for it. And one way you show your love for your country, obviously, is to fight for it.
[3:42:26.440 --> 3:42:33.440]  And this is what I have against, among many other things, against Bush and his fellow neocombs in the right wing of the party.
[3:42:33.440 --> 3:42:39.440]  The tremendous hypocrisy of these people. They're the most repugnant, hypocritical, un-American people in our society.
[3:42:39.440 --> 3:42:48.440]  When it was their time, just one example, I'm sure you have many more, Alex, when it was their time to fight for America and the Vietnam War, show their love for this country.
[3:42:48.440 --> 3:42:58.440]  What do they do? I'm talking about the Bushes, the Cheneys, the Roves, the indescribably reprehensible Rush Limbo. What do they do? They ran like hell in the opposite direction.
[3:42:58.440 --> 3:43:08.440]  But now they have no hesitancy in waving the flag and shedding the blood of other people's children in far-off Iraq. These are not good people.
[3:43:08.440 --> 3:43:16.440]  With respect to Bush's monumental crime, in this case, here's my view, and I view it more as a fact than as an opinion.
[3:43:16.440 --> 3:43:26.440]  Because George Bush is a conservative Republican and so are they, anything he does, anything at all, including murder, is just fine with them.
[3:43:26.440 --> 3:43:33.440]  Listen, I have people in my message board on infowars.com and they come in and go, yeah, the government stages events to get us into war, it's good.
[3:43:33.440 --> 3:43:41.440]  Yeah, cops are tasing people to death, it's good. I mean, it seems like it's not just Bush and his psychopathic or sociopathic activities.
[3:43:41.440 --> 3:43:48.440]  It's a whole society, and I've always seen myself as, you know, a mainline conservative slash libertarian, but it's not just George Bush.
[3:43:48.440 --> 3:43:55.440]  It's a lot of these Republican followers. They think it's cute and funny to be evil. They think it's cute and funny Iraqis are dying.
[3:43:55.440 --> 3:44:03.440]  They post on their blogs pictures of Iraqi children with their feet blown off and talk about nuking them and turning them into a glass parking lot.
[3:44:03.440 --> 3:44:12.440]  They really are demonic, psychopathic camp followers. Now, they wouldn't actually want to go below the kids feet off, they'd throw up at the side of real blood.
[3:44:12.440 --> 3:44:22.440]  But it's like some kind of, some type of stunted bloodlust. It's like a little pig-ish demon and there's hordes of them.
[3:44:22.440 --> 3:44:31.440]  And I really think it's a society that's become very decadent. I think George Bush is an expression of the rotten sectors, not saying the whole country, it's a great country that are out there.
[3:44:31.440 --> 3:44:38.440]  And it makes me ashamed because we can say they did it and they lied to us and Congress didn't know, but now the Democrats aren't going after him.
[3:44:38.440 --> 3:44:43.440]  The Democrats have still got us in the war. And it just makes me really ashamed to be an American.
[3:44:43.440 --> 3:44:50.440]  Well, Alex, I agree with everything you say. If we look at the genesis of this, I would add this up, addendum.
[3:44:50.440 --> 3:44:57.440]  These people that couldn't care less about all the killings of not only Iraqi citizens, but American soldiers, they couldn't care less.
[3:44:57.440 --> 3:45:06.440]  They say, well, this is war. My analysis is that the reason they're that way is that they are much more Republican than they are American.
[3:45:06.440 --> 3:45:14.440]  Let me ask you this. What do you think their state of mind would be if Bill Clinton were doing the same identical thing as George Bush?
[3:45:14.440 --> 3:45:18.440]  They'd be freaking out. They'd be running around freaking out, pulling their hair out.
[3:45:18.440 --> 3:45:28.440]  Well, more than that, they'd want to skin him alive, hang him in the town square at noon time. I mean, here's a guy that had consensual sex outside of marriage, try to cover it up.
[3:45:28.440 --> 3:45:40.440]  Just sublime silliness, nothing at all. And what happened to him? With these right-wingers, day after day, week after week, month after month, year after year, he was savaged by the right-wing media,
[3:45:40.440 --> 3:45:55.440]  including the liberal New York Times and Washington Post. The monstrous Ken Starr, with federal funding, conducted a seven-year, $70 million effort to destroy the Clinton presidency.
[3:45:55.440 --> 3:46:08.440]  He was impeached. They tried to drive him from office for doing nothing. And here's George Bush responsible for, like you say, probably over one million murders, and they don't want to do anything at all.
[3:46:08.440 --> 3:46:18.440]  I say this, Bush and his people have gotten away with thousands upon thousands of murders, and we, America, the American people cannot let him do this.
[3:46:18.440 --> 3:46:27.440]  And this is why I'm not going to be satisfied. I may not succeed, but I'm not going to be satisfied until I see this guy in an American courtroom being prosecuted for first-degree murder.
[3:46:27.440 --> 3:46:31.440]  And if the jury convicts them, Alex, as you know, it'll be up to them to decide the appropriate punishment.
[3:46:31.440 --> 3:46:41.440]  What are their options being the imposition of the death penalty? The other options being life imprisonment and life imprisonment without the possibility of parole?
[3:46:41.440 --> 3:46:42.440]  Are you there, Alex?
[3:46:42.440 --> 3:46:51.440]  Yes, I'm just stunned by the magnitude of what you're talking about. And again, I cut my teeth on talk radio attacking Bill Clinton for the Chinese generals and the missile secrets and the Arkansasids.
[3:46:51.440 --> 3:47:02.440]  Compared to George Bush, I mean, I'm no fan of Bill Clinton. I know people that worked with him were around him. The guy slept four hours a night. He constantly read all the government agency reports.
[3:47:02.440 --> 3:47:07.440]  He had at least pride in himself that he wanted to be sharp and know what was going on.
[3:47:07.440 --> 3:47:24.440]  I mean, just a side issue, I've been reading the military reports themselves. Many of the VA's roaches, flies, rats, no good health care, people that aren't even real doctors have been hired, overflowing toilets at bases everywhere, the C-130s falling apart, toilets overflowing,
[3:47:24.440 --> 3:47:37.440]  the men crapping in the aisles on the way over to Iraq, and then they've built all these pleasure planes for the brass. And it seems like we are Rome in 409 right before 410.
[3:47:37.440 --> 3:47:44.440]  I mean, it just seems like sectors of the government are just completely let them eat cake, Marie Antoinette.
[3:47:44.440 --> 3:47:56.440]  You know, I can't disagree with anything that you say, Alex. As they say, I guess it's a new term. I'm still the 19th century with a yellow pad and pencil. You're spot on. Is that a new term? Spot on.
[3:47:56.440 --> 3:48:01.440]  No, no, that's a good term. I just don't know. I mean, I'm not that familiar with it. I just heard it recently.
[3:48:01.440 --> 3:48:09.440]  Well, take the handling of the economy. The dollar's plunging, all these prices are up, and Bush is prancing around what two weeks ago said the economy's just fine.
[3:48:09.440 --> 3:48:23.440]  You know, talking about Clinton's alleged crimes, vis-a-vis Bush's, as you know, at the hearings Friday in Congress, there was a professor from Northwestern, Mr. Presser, I don't know his first name,
[3:48:23.440 --> 3:48:35.440]  but anyway, he was denouncing all the horrible things that George Bush did, but had no trouble with what, no, all the horrible things he said that Clinton did, but had no trouble with what George Bush did.
[3:48:35.440 --> 3:48:46.440]  And I just said to Mr. Presser, you apparently have no, apparently you think it's worse, what Clinton did, lying to the American public about consensual sex,
[3:48:46.440 --> 3:48:56.440]  and you feel that's worse than George Bush lying to the American public about going to war and all the death, horror, and suffering that has resulted from it,
[3:48:56.440 --> 3:49:06.440]  and I said, I would ask you this question, Mr. Presser, what previously recognized form of logic would allow you to reach a conclusion like that, and he was silent?
[3:49:06.440 --> 3:49:13.440]  Well, that's it. There's a craziness spreading across the country, but I don't give the Democrats cover. They should have already pulled out of Iraq.
[3:49:13.440 --> 3:49:18.440]  They should already be in full-blown impeachment hearings a year and a half ago, but we don't see that.
[3:49:18.440 --> 3:49:26.440]  Instead, we see Nancy Pelosi prancing around with Bush everywhere, so I think it's going to continue under the Democrats.
[3:49:26.440 --> 3:49:36.440]  I want to take some phone calls for our guest, and I don't want to keep you too much longer the next hour, but can you do five minutes to the next hour?
[3:49:36.440 --> 3:49:43.440]  Absolutely. Listen, I'm honored to be on this show. You're a stand-up guy, and I can't thank you enough. You know, I've been blacked out by the major media in this country.
[3:49:43.440 --> 3:49:46.440]  Yeah, talk about the blackout in the minute we've got left before break.
[3:49:46.440 --> 3:49:48.440]  Go ahead.
[3:49:48.440 --> 3:49:57.440]  Oh, right now. Well, my publisher said she has never seen another book in her over 30 years that's been totally blacked out by the mainstream national media.
[3:49:57.440 --> 3:50:08.440]  Up until a New York Times article about two weeks ago pointing out the blackout, there was a total complete blackout, no network, no table.
[3:50:08.440 --> 3:50:21.440]  Total blackout. It got so bad that ABC Radio refused to take money from my publisher to take out a radio spot on the news on their network for the book, Prosecution of George W. Bush for Murder.
[3:50:21.440 --> 3:50:30.440]  But despite that, the book, Because of People Like You, an incredible word of mouth, is a New York Times bestseller, number nine this week.
[3:50:30.440 --> 3:50:37.440]  But it's because of people like you that it's given me a voice, but the mainstream national media has not wanted to talk to me about this book.
[3:50:37.440 --> 3:50:40.440]  They don't even want to talk about Bush being prosecuted for murder.
[3:50:40.440 --> 3:50:42.440]  And that's because they know they're complicit going along with it.
[3:50:42.440 --> 3:51:08.440]  We'll be right back with your phone calls in Vincent Booglioz.

[3:54:41.440 --> 3:54:49.440]  We have one of the most successful prosecutors in US history, prosecutor Mansons, among other unsavory people that's putting it lightly.
[3:54:49.440 --> 3:54:59.440]  Vincent Bugliozzi, he has the New York Times bestseller despite a total media blackout in mainstream control corporate media out of fear and their complicity and all this.
[3:54:59.440 --> 3:55:06.440]  They have a stake in the whole establishment, basically, the military industrial complex in covering this up.
[3:55:06.440 --> 3:55:12.440]  Despite that, it is number nine on the New York Times bestseller list, the prosecution of George W. Bush for murder by Vincent Bugliozzi.
[3:55:12.440 --> 3:55:14.440]  Let's go to your phone calls.
[3:55:14.440 --> 3:55:19.440]  Frankie, in Missouri, you're on the air with Vincent Bugliozzi, Frankie.
[3:55:19.440 --> 3:55:20.440]  How are you doing?
[3:55:20.440 --> 3:55:21.440]  Good, Frankie.
[3:55:21.440 --> 3:55:24.440]  Mr. Jones, I want you to understand something.
[3:55:24.440 --> 3:55:29.440]  We got a lot of love for you out here, brother, a lot of love.
[3:55:29.440 --> 3:55:32.440]  Well, thank you. Do you have a question for Vincent Bugliozzi?
[3:55:32.440 --> 3:55:34.440]  Yes, Mr. Bugliozzi.
[3:55:34.440 --> 3:55:37.440]  I'm Italian too, so how are you doing by the time?
[3:55:37.440 --> 3:55:46.440]  I don't want to drop another name. Warren Beatty asked me the same thing on Sunday, and I said, I'm angry.
[3:55:46.440 --> 3:55:49.440]  I'm angry. I'm very, very angry.
[3:55:49.440 --> 3:55:55.440]  Mr. Bugliozzi, has there ever been a successful prosecution of somebody of Bush's status?
[3:55:55.440 --> 3:56:06.440]  And if this trial ever does come to court, will those that choose to prosecute him, will they live to see the verdict?
[3:56:06.440 --> 3:56:13.440]  Well, those that choose to prosecute him live to see the verdict, that, well, you're saying there would be a whole trial.
[3:56:13.440 --> 3:56:19.440]  And then before the verdict, after the trial, but just before the verdict, someone's going to step forward and kill them.
[3:56:19.440 --> 3:56:20.440]  Is that what you're suggesting?
[3:56:20.440 --> 3:56:28.440]  Well, I would think that, you know, somebody that does take on this type of job would have great concern.
[3:56:28.440 --> 3:56:35.440]  Well, I'm looking for a courageous prosecutor out there about two weeks ago, not even that long.
[3:56:35.440 --> 3:56:42.440]  A week and a half ago, the publisher sent out a copy of my book, Prosecution of George Bush for Murder,
[3:56:42.440 --> 3:56:50.440]  to each of the 50 state attorney generals in this country with a cover letter from me asking the prosecutor to read the book.
[3:56:50.440 --> 3:56:56.440]  And if they agree that the evidence of Bush's guilt is clear and that there's jurisdiction that they proceed against him,
[3:56:56.440 --> 3:56:59.440]  they can't prosecute him right now, but they can commence the criminal investigation of him.
[3:56:59.440 --> 3:57:07.440]  And I offered my services to the prosecutor in whichever way he or she sees fit, which would range from being a consultant
[3:57:07.440 --> 3:57:12.440]  all the way up to and including being appointed a special prosecutor.
[3:57:12.440 --> 3:57:16.440]  I certainly would not be averse to prosecuting George Bush for murder.
[3:57:16.440 --> 3:57:21.440]  And I can tell you right now that unquestionably, I would seek the death penalty against him.
[3:57:21.440 --> 3:57:28.440]  I mean, here's a guy, by the way, who is very much in favor of the death penalty, probably had the highest execution rate
[3:57:28.440 --> 3:57:30.440]  in the history of any governor.
[3:57:30.440 --> 3:57:33.440]  152 cases came across his desk when he was governor of Texas.
[3:57:33.440 --> 3:57:38.440]  And by the way, he would give press conferences and then giggle and laugh about it and talk about how they begged him.
[3:57:38.440 --> 3:57:41.440]  I mean, if you're going to execute somebody, you don't make jokes about it.
[3:57:41.440 --> 3:57:50.440]  No, of course, but he signed off on 152 of 152, even signed off on a death warrant for a young man who was mentally retarded.
[3:57:50.440 --> 3:57:52.440]  So I would seek the death penalty against him.
[3:57:52.440 --> 3:57:57.440]  I got to think there's at least one courageous prosecutor out there, and I'm going to be looking for him.
[3:57:57.440 --> 3:58:00.440]  Franky, we got to go to break.
[3:58:00.440 --> 3:58:01.440]  We got to go to break.
[3:58:01.440 --> 3:58:02.440]  Thank you for the call, Franky.
[3:58:02.440 --> 3:58:03.440]  More calls straight ahead.
[3:58:03.440 --> 3:58:04.440]  David, Walt, Stephen, others.
[3:58:04.440 --> 3:58:11.440]  There is no doubt that Vincent Boogliossi is treading where angels fear to tread.
[3:58:11.440 --> 3:58:13.440]  I mean, there is no doubt that it is.
[3:58:13.440 --> 3:58:20.440]  This guy has really got a lot of will and nerve because we're dealing with global mafia here.
[3:58:20.440 --> 3:58:22.440]  George Bush is just their front man.
[3:58:22.440 --> 3:58:23.440]  We'll be right back.
[3:58:23.440 --> 3:58:28.440]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[3:58:28.440 --> 3:58:33.440]  Visit GCNLive.com today.
[3:58:33.440 --> 3:58:41.440]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[3:58:41.440 --> 3:58:44.440]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[3:58:44.440 --> 3:58:45.440]  But who is the enemy?
[3:58:45.440 --> 3:58:46.440]  Bin Laden.
[3:58:46.440 --> 3:58:47.440]  This is his MO.
[3:58:47.440 --> 3:58:48.440]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[3:58:48.440 --> 3:58:50.440]  We have to look to the Psalm of Bin Laden.
[3:58:50.440 --> 3:58:57.440]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[3:58:57.440 --> 3:59:04.440]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis, again, very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[3:59:04.440 --> 3:59:08.440]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[3:59:08.440 --> 3:59:15.440]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers' ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network,
[3:59:15.440 --> 3:59:20.440]  warnings in war games, the shadow government, and much, much more, fabled enemies.
[3:59:20.440 --> 3:59:22.440]  Get the DVD at infowars.com.

[3:59:37.440 --> 3:59:39.440]  You have the power.
[3:59:39.440 --> 3:59:42.440]  This is the GCN Radio Network.
[3:59:42.440 --> 3:59:47.440]  Eugenics dominated the 20th century.
[3:59:47.440 --> 4:00:13.440]  Its ruthless spirit has now matured.
