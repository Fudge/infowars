[00:00.000 --> 00:12.400]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.400 --> 00:21.160]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:21.160 --> 00:26.840]  you cannot make up the magnitude of what's happening right now the globalists are moving
[00:26.840 --> 00:32.240]  on every front not just here but worldwide they are tipping their hand showing their
[00:32.240 --> 00:37.400]  true intentions because they're entering a major phase of in-game global governance takeover
[00:37.400 --> 00:44.440]  the Republican leadership quote caved in and now supports Obama's power grab over the internet
[00:44.440 --> 00:52.840]  calling it net neutrality which is synonymous with an open free internet but when you actually get
[00:52.840 --> 01:00.520]  details of the secret 322 page bill the former head of the FCC has called very dangerous the
[01:00.520 --> 01:08.320]  commissioner says quote independence of the agency has been compromised Hillary Clinton has come out
[01:08.320 --> 01:16.200]  endorsing it and was flogging and lobbying yesterday up and down Silicon Valley in California
[01:16.200 --> 01:22.600]  suddenly the Republican leadership are backing it and you've only got a few left-wing groups and
[01:22.600 --> 01:29.080]  libertarian groups fighting it here's the headline left groups now fear government net grab going
[01:29.080 --> 01:36.680]  too far electronic freedom foundation I mean it is on ladies and gentlemen look at these
[01:36.680 --> 01:44.800]  headlines FCC chair refuses to testify before Congress ahead of net neutrality vote New York
[01:44.800 --> 01:53.320]  Times FCC net neutrality rules clear hurdle as Republicans concede to Obama there are no
[01:53.320 --> 01:59.320]  regulations over free speech right now they're already criminal laws in place so it is an open
[01:59.320 --> 02:08.920]  ended system right now and a power grab if this goes into place just like Obamacare just lets
[02:08.920 --> 02:15.160]  the government do whatever it wants that's the language they admit is in there and it's large
[02:15.160 --> 02:19.400]  sectors of the establishment are freaking out right now because it's one thing to say they
[02:19.400 --> 02:25.240]  want to have Chinese style net censorship it's another thing when they start doing it and I
[02:25.240 --> 02:31.400]  just got chills 11th hour drama for net neutrality a Democrat on the federal communications
[02:31.400 --> 02:35.680]  commission wants to see changes that can narrow the scope of new net neutrality rules set for vote
[02:35.680 --> 02:42.360]  on Thursday and it goes through the three key Democrats on the committee that do not want this
[02:42.360 --> 02:52.760]  to happen but again they're trying to call the commissioner the chairman there's the chair
[02:52.760 --> 02:56.360]  and there's the commissioner two separate positions we have the former chair and the
[02:56.360 --> 03:05.880]  former commissioner of the FCC saying this is bad news and then now we've got the current FCC chair
[03:05.880 --> 03:11.680]  refusing to appear that's the headline at drudgereport.com refusing to appear before Congress
[03:11.680 --> 03:20.920]  ahead of internet takeover and notice on every front now whether it's open borders or executive
[03:20.920 --> 03:28.400]  orders on energy or gun control or foreign wars they don't care they're just doing it forced
[03:28.400 --> 03:35.600]  inoculation they're just doing it everything is moving into an accelerated high gear right now
[03:35.600 --> 03:42.720]  meanwhile poll majority of Americans support invasion of Syria and Iraq to put down US trained
[03:42.720 --> 03:49.160]  Islamic State when they admit they quote have a good group of rebels that we are funding and
[03:49.160 --> 03:56.560]  that's part of the invasion is to quote help them topple Assad that's full spectrum dominance
[03:56.560 --> 04:00.400]  and then they'll just turn loose the other radical group and let it go and take over part of Iraq
[04:00.400 --> 04:08.240]  which will be a redoubt of Saudi Arabia so the Jews get Israel and I guess Al Qaeda will get its
[04:08.240 --> 04:15.040]  new little little homeland in between Syria and Iraq I mean this is bizarro world because it's so

[08:56.440 --> 09:01.960]  that i've almost become comfortable with uh this this devilish system i don't like it i
[09:01.960 --> 09:11.480]  detest it but i've almost made a sick friend of it in that i know it so well
[09:14.280 --> 09:19.320]  and so i have a blind side i mean sure i'm up here waving my arms around warning people going

[09:27.000 --> 09:33.720]  things happening to get in the way of people focusing in on the big enchilada and that is
[09:33.720 --> 09:41.240]  that the power structure globally is accelerating a tyrannical takeover of every facet of daily
[09:41.240 --> 09:48.760]  life the family the economy health and wellness they are moving in a giant offensive where they're
[09:48.760 --> 09:55.320]  engaging in more tyranny in one year now than what happened in 10 years previously we've now
[09:55.320 --> 10:04.200]  reached that critical juncture jump point where they are abolishing states rights they are federalizing
[10:04.200 --> 10:09.800]  police all over the world they are putting carbon taxes in by fiat even if governments don't pass
[10:09.800 --> 10:15.240]  them and and arresting people that build barns on their property or have a puddle in their backyard
[10:15.240 --> 10:22.760]  uh 10 000 15 000 dollar a day fines they vary drones are surveilling now suddenly uh is neighborhoods
[10:22.760 --> 10:28.120]  and farms and ranches uh world governments openly being announced and they're on tv going yeah
[10:28.120 --> 10:32.600]  they're secret treaties being passed right now that congress can't see that put our government
[10:32.600 --> 10:40.680]  under foreign un control i mean it's happening obama for now a year has just completely opened
[10:40.680 --> 10:46.440]  the border they give the illegals all the freebies sign them up for welfare bring them in boom no other
[10:46.440 --> 10:53.000]  country would do that in the world this is north american union global governance unfolding after
[10:53.000 --> 10:57.560]  they've already imploded latin america and they're going to force that crisis to pour over our borders
[10:57.560 --> 11:02.760]  after our government and others already destabilized mexico this is a worldwide destabilization
[11:02.760 --> 11:09.480]  program and now in the last six years they have put the internet kill switch grid in place and then
[11:09.480 --> 11:17.560]  admitted it and they have systems to take over your cell phones take over your smartphones take
[11:17.560 --> 11:22.680]  over your home appliances and force government messages over them and now it's beginning they're
[11:22.680 --> 11:32.360]  actually doing it they are moving ahead to turn loose major military forces of nato against the
[11:32.360 --> 11:38.760]  russians in a proxy war on the russian doorstep in eastern ukraine right before i went live i was
[11:38.760 --> 11:47.080]  watching senate presentations it wasn't debate it wasn't filler by stirring it wasn't two-minute
[11:47.080 --> 11:55.720]  speeches it was lindsay graham john mccain and other republican senators up there with maps of
[11:55.720 --> 12:00.440]  ukraine and i sat there with a cup of coffee in my hand for five minutes from a mouth open as lindsay
[12:00.440 --> 12:05.160]  graham goes we stood up against hitler he thought he had a master race wanted to dominate and enslave
[12:05.160 --> 12:10.120]  the world and now the forces of hitler in fact i have jacobson back to grabbing the clip i'm gonna
[12:10.120 --> 12:16.040]  play it later the forces of hitler that are represented by by russia are invading and we've
[12:16.040 --> 12:21.640]  got to go in there militarily and fight them and then they cut to john mccain saying it if anyone
[12:21.640 --> 12:28.760]  knows history it was the nazis that went into western ukraine and that had a war with the russians
[12:28.760 --> 12:33.560]  and then it's eastern ukraine that fought the nazis and i'm not taking sides eastern western
[12:33.560 --> 12:40.120]  ukranians slavic russians in the east what hitler'd call arian you know in the west but they're all
[12:40.120 --> 12:50.200]  related killing each other both sides have beefs but our government was literally inverting reality
[12:50.200 --> 12:58.520]  saying that the russians are nazis and represent the nazis historically when 20 million russians
[12:58.520 --> 13:06.200]  died fighting the nazis 20 million that's why when i say america really wasn't world war two
[13:06.200 --> 13:11.560]  both my grandfathers were in world war two both of them almost died we lost 400 000 people that we
[13:11.560 --> 13:19.000]  were in world war two that was big civil war killed 700 000 world war two is our third biggest war
[13:19.000 --> 13:28.360]  world war one even killed more but compared to 20 million russians 21 to 22 million germans
[13:29.240 --> 13:34.680]  i mean the the the germans and the russians were toe to toe for three and a half years
[13:35.640 --> 13:40.840]  slaughtering each other in major cities just toe to toe in stalingrad and other areas where
[13:40.840 --> 13:44.680]  millions were killed in one city i mean you talk about war there's never been anything like it
[13:44.680 --> 13:51.240]  nothing ever like it can you imagine the russians when they see that on their television
[13:51.800 --> 13:57.160]  our senators saying they're the nazis and using examples as hitler and maps of hitler i mean this
[13:57.160 --> 14:11.000]  is inverted reality upside down 1984 writ large i it's just mind blowing just like obama care
[14:11.000 --> 14:15.240]  was written by giant insurance companies on record to double and triple your prices create
[14:15.240 --> 14:21.960]  death panels screw you over raise seven taxes on poor people 20 plus taxes total global profits
[14:21.960 --> 14:27.720]  up almost 50 47 49 depending on what number you look at tripling the profits just domestically
[14:27.720 --> 14:32.920]  for insurance companies but worldwide they're screwing us so bad right now that insurance
[14:32.920 --> 14:38.440]  companies worldwide have had a 47 to 49 increase in 2013 2014
[14:38.440 --> 14:48.600]  that's reality inverted that's fascist health care with a fake liberal stumbling around
[14:49.400 --> 14:55.000]  all of this is fascism the end of our sovereignty the open borders the the shutting off our power
[14:55.000 --> 15:03.240]  plants while china opens three new ones a week and then and then they have the internet kill switch
[15:03.240 --> 15:08.760]  in place they're trying to pass cyber security legislation that sopa and syspa wrapped in together
[15:08.760 --> 15:14.360]  they've got language in here that basically says anything offensive anything threatening
[15:15.800 --> 15:25.160]  can be taken down by the FCC this is the FCC is going to now be giving orders to major internet
[15:25.160 --> 15:30.680]  providers to just take websites down we've had a whole bunch in game was taken down
[15:30.680 --> 15:35.160]  and i had to threaten to sue people and they put it back up last week we have they're trying to
[15:35.160 --> 15:42.040]  y'all don't channel down right now for us talking and showing a BBC news article
[15:43.880 --> 15:49.240]  so right now we can barely reach you we can barely stay on air right now
[15:51.640 --> 15:57.240]  this isn't the FCC saying you can't say the s word or the f word on broadcast this is the FCC
[15:57.240 --> 16:01.160]  saying we're going to protect the internet by making it a government utility and putting
[16:01.160 --> 16:06.120]  regulations over it and they now have gotten part of the 322 pages that are secret that basically
[16:06.120 --> 16:10.200]  sets a censorship and the republican leaderships come out and said let's pass the bill we're joining
[16:10.200 --> 16:17.240]  with obama and it's libertarian groups paleo conservatives and the left that are freaking
[16:17.240 --> 16:22.440]  out left group now fear government net grab going too far we got to get wane madson on today let's
[16:22.440 --> 16:27.080]  call wane madson or let's call and we didn't have any guests that didn't want to yesterday but i think
[16:27.080 --> 16:33.400]  of wane madson popping in on this or one of our other web experts would be good dear FCC rethink
[16:33.400 --> 16:43.400]  the vague general conduct rule you see that you got to watch your general conduct for many months
[16:43.400 --> 16:47.240]  eff has been working with a brawn coalition of advocates to persuade the federal communications
[16:47.240 --> 16:51.160]  commission to adopt new open internet rules that would survive legal scrutiny and actually help
[16:51.160 --> 16:55.960]  protect the open internet our message has been clear from the beginning the FCC has a role to play
[16:55.960 --> 17:03.160]  but its role must be firmly bound see what i tell you six months ago when i got attacked by
[17:03.160 --> 17:07.240]  all the big liberal publications when i said this is not net neutrality this is a trojan horse power
[17:07.240 --> 17:12.520]  grab it's going to be written totally vague because hillary and obama were endorsing it folks
[17:12.520 --> 17:19.560]  they don't endorse anything unless it's evil two weeks ago we learned that we had likely managed
[17:19.560 --> 17:24.200]  the first goal the FCC is going to the right thing and reclassified broadband telecommunication
[17:24.200 --> 17:29.160]  service giving it the ability to make new meaningful open internet rules but we are deeply
[17:29.160 --> 17:33.000]  concerned the FCC's new rules will include a provision that sounds like a recipe for
[17:33.000 --> 17:38.760]  overreach and confusion the so-called general conduct rule but again they will not even testify
[17:38.760 --> 17:42.520]  to congress and say what's in the pages according to the FCC's own fact sheet to propose rule will
[17:42.520 --> 17:50.120]  allow FCC to review and presumably punish non-neutral practices that may harm consumers or edge
[17:50.120 --> 17:54.440]  providers they've already said what that means if your little website doesn't provide audio
[17:54.440 --> 17:59.720]  translation or language translation they'll shut you down then you got to pay for that so it makes
[17:59.720 --> 18:05.000]  it cost prohibitive to put out your free speech you can't limit the first amendment just because
[18:05.000 --> 18:10.920]  somebody speaks spanish or mandarin chinese or english that's like saying if i go give a speech
[18:10.920 --> 18:14.840]  on a street corner i'm violating someone's right under political correctness if i don't have a
[18:14.840 --> 18:20.280]  voice box changer like in star trek that translates it to everybody but that's what they're saying
[18:20.280 --> 18:25.960]  that's just one example of course the FCC's own fact sheet proposal rule will allow FCC
[18:25.960 --> 18:31.080]  to review do you hear that and presumably punish non-neutral practices that may harm consumers
[18:31.080 --> 18:37.640]  or edge providers late last week as the window for public comment was closing EFF filed a letter
[18:37.640 --> 18:42.440]  with the FCC urging it to clarify and sharply limit the scope of any general conduct provision
[18:42.440 --> 18:47.480]  folks whether it's the free health care of obama care of the doubles and triples prices and his
[18:47.480 --> 18:52.680]  giant screw job or whether it's you know free healthy energy that means cutting off her energy
[18:52.680 --> 18:57.800]  or whether it means protecting the internet means taking it over it's an open-ended giant
[18:57.800 --> 19:04.920]  power grab a blank check period we already had net neutrality they're called like jesse van
[19:04.920 --> 19:10.840]  turris said yesterday antitrust laws and congress could tell the big telecoms you're making money
[19:10.840 --> 19:15.720]  hand over fist you charge for the bandwidth to provider provider you're not going to put toll
[19:15.720 --> 19:20.520]  roads up on this the whole infrastructure is paid for it's the only part of our economy that keeps
[19:20.520 --> 19:25.640]  growing keep your stinking hands off of it or we're going to have any trust hearings right now
[19:25.640 --> 19:33.640]  and no one would do it they've they've had peer-to-peer wars many times in my 20 years on air
[19:33.640 --> 19:38.040]  and every time within days whoever tries it stops it because it just screws the whole
[19:38.040 --> 19:44.760]  internet up and lawsuits get fired up so leave it alone leave it alone that's what net neutrality

[24:14.200 --> 24:20.920]  peya if i pronounce that right says net neutrality is a solution that won't work to a problem that
[24:20.920 --> 24:28.520]  doesn't exist exactly this is government coming in to basically in net neutrality and start ending
[24:28.520 --> 24:34.200]  free speech and a giant power grab just like we told you the patriot act would be used against
[24:34.200 --> 24:40.200]  non-terror related cases now it's basically used exclusively to get rid of the bill of rights and
[24:40.200 --> 24:45.160]  constitution because we could read how it was written well now they just keep it secret another
[24:45.160 --> 24:52.840]  big telltale but pieces of it are coming out then you've got tom wheeler a democrat the
[24:52.840 --> 24:57.720]  current chairman of the federal communications commission we have a clip of him on pbs we're
[24:57.720 --> 25:04.680]  going to play here in just a moment he refuses to testify to congress he's under congress chartered
[25:04.680 --> 25:11.160]  by congress but congress is so neutered i mean they should have him contempt charges right now
[25:11.160 --> 25:17.640]  you know and a u.s attorney should move to have him indicted today just like the attorney general
[25:17.640 --> 25:24.200]  refusing to testify and all the rest of it these people are belligerent braggins under our system
[25:24.200 --> 25:32.440]  of law and so now i'm not going to let you see it and i'm not going to testify sit down and shut up
[25:32.440 --> 25:38.040]  it's the bureaucracy run by special interests and obama doing whatever they want and the republican
[25:38.040 --> 25:44.920]  leadership just went you know what we're going to support it new york times michael powell has come
[25:44.920 --> 25:50.920]  out son of colin powell and said this is super bad news i have that article right here but first
[25:50.920 --> 25:56.280]  let's go to the clip of the current head who won't testify to congress this is very interesting here
[25:56.280 --> 26:03.240]  he is two weeks ago we're really not doing utility regulation here utility regulation
[26:03.240 --> 26:09.640]  it was developed for a monopoly model what we're doing is we're taking the legal construct
[26:10.760 --> 26:18.440]  that once was used for phone companies and pairing it back to modernize it so it specifically
[26:18.440 --> 26:24.600]  deals with this issue so it's not really utility the FCC has only had jurisdictions since it was
[26:24.600 --> 26:32.200]  set up in the 20s over broadcast a m f m u h f v h f this is a giant power grab into all
[26:32.200 --> 26:38.280]  telecommunications and the internet by a bunch of people who've been meeting with the communist
[26:38.280 --> 26:43.880]  chinese czars who are over censorship and who are now implementing and saying they want to implement
[26:45.480 --> 26:50.280]  now let's continue with the giant power grab here it is regulation but it is regulation
[26:50.280 --> 26:55.880]  to make sure that there is somebody watching out for the consumer oh like you said there's no
[26:55.880 --> 27:02.760]  paid prioritization there's no blocking there's no throttling and most important there will be ongoing
[27:02.760 --> 27:12.600]  rules in perpetuity oh so that there'll be a yardstick to measure what's fair for consumers
[27:12.600 --> 27:16.040]  because we don't know what the internet's going to be five years from now and we don't know what the
[27:16.600 --> 27:20.520]  various tricks are going to be five years from now but we're going to have a referee on the field
[27:20.520 --> 27:28.040]  okay starting with the national cable telecommunications association which put out this statement
[27:28.040 --> 27:34.120]  today they said despite the repeated assurances from the president and chairman wheeler we remain
[27:34.120 --> 27:39.320]  concerned that this proposal will confer sweeping discretion to regulate rates and set the economic
[27:39.320 --> 27:43.400]  terms and conditions of business relationships just the opposite of what you just promised that
[27:43.400 --> 27:48.840]  is the opposite you're right and i think that when they actually see the proposal oh my god after
[27:48.840 --> 27:53.880]  it's enacted by the commission they'll see that there is no rate regulation they'll see that there
[27:53.880 --> 27:59.800]  is no terrifying they'll see that there's no unbundling all the classic utility kinds of activities
[27:59.800 --> 28:07.160]  and what there is is in place a set of safeguards for consumers but at the same time allow those
[28:07.160 --> 28:11.880]  cable companies to make a fair return so they're instead have to expand their networks this is
[28:11.880 --> 28:17.000]  what it is there is not government regulation over the internet at this point itself there are laws
[28:17.000 --> 28:25.000]  over criminal activity this is a federal government power grab of the internet as the wall street
[28:25.000 --> 28:31.800]  journal called it from internet to obama net and it is the obama noids the same big corporations
[28:31.800 --> 28:38.920]  that brought you obama care the screw job of screw jobs that are now backing all of this
[28:38.920 --> 28:46.840]  so what's that tell you and he says and they will get to see it the coalition of cable
[28:46.840 --> 28:51.720]  companies a lot of them small mom and pops that's why you're seeing some sense out of them some of
[28:51.720 --> 28:56.120]  the big ones are supporting it because they know they'll be left alone they've got the lobbying power
[28:57.640 --> 29:02.680]  so this is a giant grab of the internet and you notice he said after it's enacted you can see it
[29:02.680 --> 29:09.400]  just like with these pacific partnerships in north american union agreements the text of the
[29:09.400 --> 29:14.520]  north american union treaty signed by the sentry fox paul martin and george bush in 2005 in laco
[29:14.520 --> 29:21.880]  texas at baler university a hundred miles from where i sit is still secret boy that sounds like
[29:21.880 --> 29:26.600]  a free country to me doesn't it but we see the result obama's following the secret treaty open
[29:26.600 --> 29:37.720]  borders world government it's incredible simply amazing and these big trans pacific partnerships
[29:38.600 --> 29:47.560]  we still can't see the text of that congress can't i mean this is over the top totalitarianism
[29:47.560 --> 29:57.720]  we're on the march the empire's on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network

[32:57.240 --> 33:09.080]  crashing through the lies and disinformation it's alex jones on the gcn radio network
[33:28.280 --> 33:36.040]  this is a jeep pie the fcc commissioner on what the fcc chairman and obama and the republican
[33:36.040 --> 33:41.960]  leadership against the republican majority and the democrats are doing again it's the insiders
[33:41.960 --> 33:47.160]  the people at the top who want the open borders the global government the gun control the wars
[33:47.160 --> 33:52.360]  it is the scum the committee chairman they are the problem they are the ones run by the foreign
[33:52.360 --> 33:58.200]  banks running this country into the ground let's go to that clip why is that regulation book so
[33:58.200 --> 34:03.960]  thick well that's that's part of the reason why i want this to be released to the american public
[34:03.960 --> 34:08.840]  i think if you told the average american that the fcc is going to propose regulations for the
[34:08.840 --> 34:14.280]  internet economy that are 332 pages long and you're not going to be able to see it until the fcc
[34:14.280 --> 34:19.240]  adopts it they would think that's the wrong way to go and part of the reason why i've been so
[34:19.240 --> 34:23.880]  outspoken about this plan is that it's very intrusive unfortunately under the fcc's rules
[34:23.880 --> 34:29.320]  i can't describe with any particularity what's in the document and so i think that we at the fcc
[34:29.320 --> 34:34.360]  should be as open and transparent as the internet itself and let the american people see for themselves
[34:34.360 --> 34:38.280]  what it is that we're talking about wait a minute you can't tell me what's in the document
[34:39.160 --> 34:45.800]  that is correct stamped on the front is an internal use only non-public uh moniker and
[34:45.800 --> 34:50.600]  unless i'm authorized by the chairman to disclose this i can't let you or any of the other millions
[34:50.600 --> 34:55.480]  of americans who are interested in the internet economy know what the fcc is going to do why until
[34:55.480 --> 35:01.560]  we vote on february 26th this document will not be released why well that's been the traditional
[35:01.560 --> 35:06.280]  practice believe it or not of the fcc uh the chairman circulates a proposal three weeks
[35:06.280 --> 35:12.280]  before we vote on it it's kept a secret within the walls of the fcc and only after we vote on it
[35:12.280 --> 35:16.920]  and uh staff has a chance to make changes uh does the public get to see what exactly it is that we
[35:16.920 --> 35:23.160]  voted on so technically on what can viewer viewers if viewers are going to call the fcc what are
[35:23.160 --> 35:27.800]  going to tell them if they don't know what it's in the document if i can i tell them don't pass this
[35:27.800 --> 35:32.680]  if i don't know what's in it exactly that's exactly the problem and that's part of the reason why
[35:32.680 --> 35:37.480]  i have been banging the drum in favor of releasing the document and barring that trying to educate
[35:37.480 --> 35:43.240]  the public as best i can within the rules now folks the fcc commissioner actually runs the fcc
[35:43.880 --> 35:49.800]  and he's saying it's horrible so he's like the police chief but then you've got the mayor
[35:50.600 --> 35:54.680]  who says it's a great idea but don't let anybody see it you've got the head of the board
[35:55.480 --> 36:00.120]  that's political saying don't let the public see this and you got the guy that actually
[36:00.120 --> 36:05.720]  runs the fcc saying here it is it's secret with red tape i know what's in it it's really bad
[36:05.720 --> 36:10.760]  but i'm not allowed to tell you well we've had senator graham and congressman jones and others
[36:10.760 --> 36:14.600]  that have seen the 28 pages of the 911 report that's secret and it just says our government
[36:14.600 --> 36:20.520]  stood down because saudi arabia was quarterbacking 9-11 see inside job government knew government
[36:20.520 --> 36:27.960]  stood down i'm correct i'm vindicated where are the apologies where where are they they're nowhere
[36:28.760 --> 36:34.440]  and let me tell all the neocons and fake right-wingers and fake liberals all over fox cnn talk radio you
[36:34.440 --> 36:40.600]  name it when isis or al qaeda does something bigger than 9-11 everybody who's got a brain knows our
[36:40.600 --> 36:44.760]  government built them up again and let them attack and you're not going to get away with this time
[36:44.760 --> 36:51.480]  you understand good because everybody's going to know you've been accomplices and help and cover all
[36:51.480 --> 36:59.240]  this up with your red herrings alex says there's no such thing as radical islamicist alex doesn't
[36:59.240 --> 37:05.400]  in the no our government's giving them the weapons and protecting them but again it's tiny criminal
[37:05.400 --> 37:10.520]  groups at the top you've even got the fcc commissioner saying it's bad the former head of the fcc
[37:10.520 --> 37:18.600]  saying it's bad the former chairman pal let's uh play that clip right now here's a clip of pal
[37:19.720 --> 37:26.360]  the next phase of this uh long tortured net neutrality event will be likely litigation so
[37:26.360 --> 37:31.080]  we're going to wait to see what the fcc order actually says and does but we think it's very
[37:31.080 --> 37:37.080]  likely that they'll likely be an appeal so one of the things we've all talked about is what an
[37:37.080 --> 37:44.360]  appeal looks like and how long it takes and what that does to investment in in during that period
[37:44.360 --> 37:50.440]  we've heard from the ceo of atc who said that he plans to pull back can you speak to that broadly
[37:50.440 --> 37:55.480]  from all of your constituents you've been talking to sure i think uh to to put it briefly
[37:55.480 --> 38:02.040]  litigation with fcc appeals is a pretty long drawn out process i would predict that it's at least
[38:02.760 --> 38:09.240]  two and up to five years before the rules are fully and finally settled the original classification
[38:09.240 --> 38:14.360]  decision went all the way to the supreme court and took a good three and a half four years if you
[38:14.360 --> 38:20.760]  look at the current set of net neutrality rules in 2010 it's 2015 and we still don't have a new set
[38:20.760 --> 38:25.320]  and this debate has gone on for a decade it's one of the reasons we believe this issue is right for
[38:25.320 --> 38:30.440]  congress to fix exactly mute all the litigation and of course from an investment standpoint
[38:31.000 --> 38:35.480]  companies have to understand what the settled nature of the law is they've understood that
[38:35.480 --> 38:40.040]  the they've understood the law for 15 years and suddenly that's going to be radically
[38:40.040 --> 38:45.560]  transformed to a new style of regulation which is going to prompt a whole myriad of questions
[38:45.560 --> 38:49.720]  that are going to wait answers and i think that's going to have an impact on investment choices
[38:49.720 --> 38:54.600]  and the special interest the big telecoms you can bet your bottom dollar when it comes out have
[38:54.600 --> 39:02.280]  written this and it is going to be one sided to consolidate power and the fcc a very totalitarian
[39:02.280 --> 39:10.600]  organization at least historically very anti-free speech organization is going to now have jurisdiction
[39:10.600 --> 39:15.640]  over all telecommunications that means well you notice it's already i think it's a broadcast device
[39:15.640 --> 39:21.080]  like a smart meter your clock radio you know it's got the fcc sticker on the back this is just going
[39:21.080 --> 39:25.800]  to turn it loose into everything and it'll take years for them to really take it over but they will
[39:27.560 --> 39:32.760]  they already tried with obama about five years ago saying oh all broadband and and free wi-fi
[39:32.760 --> 39:36.680]  that government's going to give you it will be censored and it will be under government control
[39:36.680 --> 39:41.560]  already in london and germany and other places you go get on the quote free mass transit wi-fi
[39:41.560 --> 39:46.200]  that's paid for by taxpayers it's not free and it tells you a message everything's being monitored
[39:46.200 --> 39:50.840]  everything's being tracked so there's no freedom on this government web but it's free but we pay for
[39:50.840 --> 39:57.880]  it not true and oh by the way fcc regulation is going to be over here domestically just like they
[39:57.880 --> 40:04.760]  have similar systems in europe so they provide it quote free so they can then claim jurisdiction
[40:04.760 --> 40:12.600]  over the entire thing republican fcc commissioners ask wheeler to delay
[40:12.600 --> 40:18.680]  net neutrality vote release proposal this just came out a few minutes ago we respectfully request
[40:18.680 --> 40:23.800]  the fcc leadership immediately release the three three two pages that's the skull and bones number
[40:23.800 --> 40:30.760]  isn't that funny internet regulation plan publicly and allow the american people a reasonable period
[40:30.760 --> 40:35.160]  of not less than 30 days to carefully study it remember obama had a promise that he would
[40:35.160 --> 40:38.440]  have seven days to read the bills republican commissioners
[40:40.840 --> 40:45.960]  mr pie and o'reilly said in a statement monday that after the commission reviews the specific
[40:45.960 --> 40:50.600]  input it receives for the american public it makes any modifications the plan is appropriate
[40:50.600 --> 40:58.760]  we could proceed to a final vote see that's even a red herring you don't want the fcc
[40:58.760 --> 41:04.280]  over the internet it was designed by darpa and the pentagon to survive a nuclear attack
[41:04.280 --> 41:09.480]  it's designed to not be controlled and be organic it's already basically run between
[41:09.480 --> 41:14.200]  three big groups google's the top of it in the nsa so they already pretty much run it
[41:14.200 --> 41:19.880]  they just want to make this announcement to everybody the fcc received more than four
[41:19.880 --> 41:25.960]  million comments on its hashtag open internet during past year that helped shape proposal
[41:25.960 --> 41:32.120]  it's time to act does does anyone really believe that that they're actually listening to that input
[41:33.000 --> 41:39.880]  they're listening to the input of the globalist hillary clinton endorses fcc's title to designation
[41:39.880 --> 41:44.040]  yesterday she's out lobbying for it i mean that ought to tell you everything you need to know
[41:44.040 --> 41:50.920]  the brian williams of politics hillary clinton fcc chair refuses to testify before congress
[41:50.920 --> 41:56.120]  ahead of net neutrality maybe they'll fly him out of the country fcc net neutrality rules clear
[41:56.120 --> 42:04.840]  hurdle as republicans concede to obama senior republican conceded on tuesday to the grueling
[42:04.840 --> 42:09.400]  fight with president obama over the regulation of internet service appears over with president and an
[42:09.400 --> 42:15.480]  army of internet activists victorias an army of democratic party moron wonks going we're gonna
[42:15.480 --> 42:23.240]  free the internet we are yeah yeah yeah really well the electronic frontier foundation the eff
[42:25.160 --> 42:31.240]  just came out and said this is an absolutely horrible deal and republicans on capital hill who
[42:31.240 --> 42:35.880]  once criticized the plan is obama care for the internet now say they're unlikely to pass the
[42:35.880 --> 42:39.800]  legislative response that would undo perhaps the biggest policy shift since the internet became
[42:39.800 --> 42:46.200]  reality yes it's al gore invented it and he also you know there's a mystery who did the pyramids
[42:46.200 --> 42:50.120]  there's actually not it was al gore he has a teleportation device and an army of flying
[42:50.120 --> 42:59.800]  saucers and he went back at the time and built it did obi won ever told you who your father is
[42:59.800 --> 43:08.600]  he told me enough he told me you killed him no al gore is your father ridiculous
[43:13.400 --> 43:21.400]  oh my goodness and again the larger question is why is it all moving right now in unison
[43:22.040 --> 43:27.720]  why are the globalist moving not just here but worldwide that's my big question net neutrality
[43:27.720 --> 43:33.880]  the future of freedom on the internet it's all to be discussed here wane madsen joins us for 30
[43:33.880 --> 43:37.080]  minutes but i'm gonna start taking calls here in just a few minutes the toll free number to join

[43:51.080 --> 43:58.280]  here like the colossus straddling two different worlds old dinosaur am and fm that is the original
[43:58.280 --> 44:05.160]  proto independent media because it was the only independent medium this country for decades true
[44:05.160 --> 44:09.400]  grassroots electronic soapbox where you could be heard wasn't perfect but it was the real McCoy
[44:09.400 --> 44:14.360]  that's why it merges so well with the internet and freedom old dinosaur controlled corporate
[44:14.360 --> 44:19.320]  press is dying as we move into this basically government and corporate propaganda they're
[44:19.320 --> 44:23.960]  going to want to shut down free independent voices like info wars drudge world net daily and you
[44:25.160 --> 44:29.480]  the answer is more of us have websites more of us be involved on globalist platforms
[44:29.480 --> 44:33.400]  that we just take over the system they'll never be able to stop us that's why it's important for
[44:33.400 --> 44:39.880]  all of you to be online activist promoting whether it's sovereignty family rights medical
[44:40.600 --> 44:46.920]  rights not be forcibly inoculated you pick your issue or a raft of issues get involved

[44:54.360 --> 45:00.280]  a coalition of leftist internet experts paleo conservatives and libertarians fighting this
[45:00.280 --> 45:05.160]  and it's the republican pigs and the democratic hogs the establishment scum with a bunch of
[45:05.160 --> 45:09.160]  foreign corporations that want to carve up the web and shut down their competition because they
[45:09.160 --> 45:15.400]  cannot compete we've had 10 senators or five or six congress members i think three or four more
[45:15.400 --> 45:19.640]  senators 10 members of congress which is written article last year about it so i know it's 10 come
[45:19.640 --> 45:25.720]  out and call for the return of of of the quote fairness doctrine orwellian name to censor free
[45:25.720 --> 45:32.760]  speech on talk radio and for a fairness doctrine online so that's what they're doing here that's
[45:32.760 --> 45:42.440]  what this is guaranteed now we had obama care and it had the bioethics death panels and people
[45:42.440 --> 45:46.440]  still couldn't believe that was in there when we had the the the actual text of it and they just
[45:46.440 --> 45:51.880]  ridiculed us the army of liberals that wanted it now there's an army of liberals that want this
[45:51.880 --> 45:55.160]  even an army of trendy shills that think they're liberal and aren't

[54:41.400 --> 54:46.040]  it too antonio you're on the air from toronto canada welcome
[54:50.280 --> 54:59.000]  okay uh you there antonio i'm here okay go ahead i said uh hi and thank you i'm a little nervous
[54:59.000 --> 55:04.440]  but i've quickly made some points to to view some things so to to go on your comment about
[55:04.440 --> 55:09.880]  as it is above above so it is below there are times when i hear you on your ranch and i can
[55:09.880 --> 55:15.480]  empathize but one of the things i keep remembering as as it says the second corinthians for the god
[55:15.480 --> 55:24.520]  of this age has blinded the minds of unbelievers so it is a spiritual battle um you ask why are we
[55:24.520 --> 55:31.000]  heading towards things so quickly i think taking looking at a little bit of everything with people
[55:31.000 --> 55:36.120]  like bob fletcher who talked about the inbound planet people like martin armstrong who have charts
[55:36.120 --> 55:42.600]  showing september is a time um with another leader jonathan kahn who talks about the year of the
[55:42.600 --> 55:51.880]  schmita um i came across a youtube with augustal perez and a a junior astronomist gill g busard
[55:51.880 --> 55:56.440]  who has information that is free to go out there but if we look at the blood moons how they've
[55:56.440 --> 56:03.560]  happened two times in a row he has evidence showing that this inbound planet is coming in march of
[56:03.560 --> 56:13.240]  Passover of 2016 and to uh to the uh piece of tabernacles uh of 2016 as well so it's sort of like
[56:13.800 --> 56:19.640]  uh i thought september why why this year they're saying an economic collapse these guys love to
[56:19.640 --> 56:27.640]  see us um um they laugh in our faces with regards to wanting as a broke and being stuck and powerless
[56:27.640 --> 56:31.640]  and helpless that's what they're all about they do not want upper mobility they want us to just
[56:31.640 --> 56:35.880]  tune into their mainstream television and let them control our minds and our destiny they
[56:35.880 --> 56:40.760]  traffic in the souls of men as revelation says but but i appreciate your call let me just comment
[56:40.760 --> 56:47.240]  on the inbound planet thing i've been on air 20 years and i've been hearing about planet x and a
[56:47.240 --> 56:53.720]  bureau for every year since then and i'm always wrong because i don't think it's coming uh undoubtedly
[56:53.720 --> 56:58.840]  throughout our history there are hundreds of planets out in the kuiper belt planetoids uh
[56:58.840 --> 57:03.880]  bigger than pluto dozens bigger than pluto they've got elect radio telescopes that have
[57:03.880 --> 57:07.640]  picked them up chronicle then we've had probes go out there we know there are comets that come
[57:07.640 --> 57:12.760]  through we know this type of thing has happened and we know our ancestors probably went through
[57:12.760 --> 57:18.440]  some of it that's why every culture talks about it but i mean this is waiting on a slow train don't
[57:18.440 --> 57:23.880]  come the sun could do a big ejection of a mass corona and cause some problems and knock out all
[57:23.880 --> 57:31.320]  the telecommunications a kerington event so there's a lot of serious stuff going on out there uh i just
[57:31.320 --> 57:37.320]  see the real globalist acceleration for kering that's certainly happening but maybe you're right
[57:37.320 --> 57:40.440]  maybe they're getting ready for some type of natural disaster that's what a lot of people
[57:40.440 --> 57:43.560]  think it's just that the people that keep predicting that it never seems to happen

[1:00:36.840 --> 1:00:43.400]  by the guardian today now they were reporting um base off of anthony hill is a criminal defense
[1:00:43.400 --> 1:00:49.480]  attorney in chicago and what they're saying right now is going on chicago police department
[1:00:49.480 --> 1:00:56.200]  is arresting and attaining u.s citizens for days on end at a secret compound this is a place called
[1:00:56.200 --> 1:01:01.640]  homin square where u.s citizens are essentially treated like terrorists lawyers have compared it
[1:01:01.640 --> 1:01:08.520]  to an off the book cia black site police are seeing wearing military gear and have armored tanks
[1:01:08.520 --> 1:01:14.680]  posted outside of the warehouse where this guantanamo style places the site is used to
[1:01:14.680 --> 1:01:19.640]  interrogate citizens out of the view of law enforcement chain of command citizens are sent
[1:01:19.640 --> 1:01:26.040]  to a black site so no record of arrest can ever be found lawyers who show up to look for clients
[1:01:26.040 --> 1:01:31.240]  are turned away and police say that they are jeopardizing undercover operations now i'm going
[1:01:31.240 --> 1:01:36.120]  to read you apart from the uh business insider article says there are usually questions about
[1:01:36.120 --> 1:01:40.840]  whether these arrests are justifiable or constitutional anthony hill a criminal defense
[1:01:40.840 --> 1:01:46.440]  attorney told business insider suspected criminals are just picked up and thrown into the back of
[1:01:46.440 --> 1:01:51.640]  an unmarked car by police officers wielding assault rifles and wearing bulletproof vests
[1:01:51.640 --> 1:01:59.320]  describing the process is highly militarized this is one of the craziest things i've had to report
[1:01:59.320 --> 1:02:04.120]  on since i've been here you know you gotta think if a place like this is in chicago wonder how many
[1:02:04.120 --> 1:02:10.200]  other black site off the record tight places there are in america detaining people picking
[1:02:10.200 --> 1:02:15.880]  them up off the streets not reading them the maranda rights not giving them the constitutional
[1:02:15.880 --> 1:02:21.080]  rights that they're supposed to have as american citizens prisoners who ask for lawyers are denied
[1:02:21.080 --> 1:02:26.840]  that option at this place and when they say i want my lawyer you tell them shut up your time
[1:02:26.840 --> 1:02:34.280]  get a lawyer this is the post 9 11 world that we live in this is a guantanamo based scenario right
[1:02:34.280 --> 1:02:39.560]  in the heartland of america and this is something that we are going to do a lot more research into
[1:02:39.560 --> 1:02:44.360]  and i'm going to be digging into this subject for quite some time because this is out of control
[1:02:44.360 --> 1:02:46.680]  we do not need this in america
[1:02:51.160 --> 1:02:55.960]  thanks for moving into my gear we're gonna cover more of this report at the bottom of the hour
[1:02:55.960 --> 1:03:00.680]  after we take some phone calls and talk to wane madson formally with the national security agency
[1:03:00.680 --> 1:03:05.560]  let's go back to ryan to let him finish up in this two minutes we have left you say you
[1:03:05.560 --> 1:03:10.280]  disagree that i'm right about this net neutrality being a trojan horse to end net neutrality well
[1:03:10.280 --> 1:03:14.920]  yeah it's an FCC takeover period that's the end of net neutrality forget about corporations fighting
[1:03:14.920 --> 1:03:18.840]  with each other this is the government i mean you know so i agree with you there you say you
[1:03:18.840 --> 1:03:26.200]  disagree on the border situation if we don't give freebies out to the whole world of poor people
[1:03:26.200 --> 1:03:29.960]  then we could bring the immigrants here i'm not against the individual immigrant
[1:03:29.960 --> 1:03:36.680]  we need them hell we killed most of the new generation 55 million kids since roe v wade so so
[1:03:36.680 --> 1:03:42.120]  so i mean do you still disagree because it's not right that i can't go to mexico and and have a baby
[1:03:42.120 --> 1:03:45.640]  and have it paid for by the government but somebody from mexico can come here that's wrong
[1:03:45.640 --> 1:03:52.520]  and why are these people entitled go ahead what's your point no wait um yeah it's a heavy heavy
[1:03:52.520 --> 1:03:57.960]  issue to me uh you know welfare on its own i mean i live right in our town that is just
[1:03:57.960 --> 1:04:03.320]  built on gaming the system and really with the good you know with an industrial town all of that's
[1:04:03.320 --> 1:04:11.480]  gone so i mean that's horrible but the whole situation with illegal immigrants are who we
[1:04:11.480 --> 1:04:16.120]  get an id we're gonna that's all feeds into the national id well here's where you're right
[1:04:16.120 --> 1:04:20.120]  here's where you're right with lamar smith from texas and the rest of them they get police state
[1:04:20.120 --> 1:04:25.800]  laws passed on national id saying it's free legals and then the illegals are exempt so i agree with
[1:04:25.800 --> 1:04:31.080]  you and ron paul that the fence is bad because it's only to keep us in not people out i just don't
[1:04:31.080 --> 1:04:34.360]  want to hear i've got to give my liberties up because of a terror threat when the government's
[1:04:34.360 --> 1:04:41.880]  behind al-qaeda makes sense that yeah exactly that's why it's a heavy issue no this is all i

[1:08:48.680 --> 1:08:58.360]  but before we go any further i want to just recap the news here they are trying tomorrow
[1:08:58.360 --> 1:09:04.920]  to pass a secret 322 page sec regulation that is the FCC is going to issue it
[1:09:04.920 --> 1:09:11.880]  it and they say it's going to pass their board we've got multiple commissioners that actually
[1:09:11.880 --> 1:09:17.800]  do the work the chairman's like the mayor saying it's a horrible idea they're fixing a problem
[1:09:17.800 --> 1:09:23.400]  that doesn't exist net neutrality is a solution that won't work to a problem that doesn't exist
[1:09:23.400 --> 1:09:29.720]  that's what one chairman said chairman pie you've got the republican leadership of course we now
[1:09:29.720 --> 1:09:34.040]  learn has been involved the whole time and supports it that's in the new york times you've got the
[1:09:34.040 --> 1:09:39.320]  normal coalition of kind of renamob fake liberal trendies that are supporting it you've got hillary
[1:09:39.320 --> 1:09:45.320]  out promoting it this is the FCC that has no regulatory power over the internet getting
[1:09:45.320 --> 1:09:51.000]  that power and that's what hillary said quote to silicon valley yesterday quote it gets a foot in the
[1:09:51.000 --> 1:10:01.800]  door or a camels nose under the tent flap and she supports it now that's got to tell you something
[1:10:01.800 --> 1:10:05.800]  so just like with obama care the republican and democratic leadership are for it the grassroots
[1:10:05.800 --> 1:10:13.640]  is against it until they're brainwashed and it's the same story over and over and over again
[1:10:16.920 --> 1:10:21.800]  now i don't know wane madson's view on this overall i just know that he covers telecommunications
[1:10:21.800 --> 1:10:29.080]  the nsa the cia net neutrality and is involved with the electronic frontier foundation and the
[1:10:29.080 --> 1:10:33.080]  freedom of the internet groups has been involved in it since these groups were started he testified
[1:10:33.080 --> 1:10:41.400]  to congress the eu uh you name it members of uh congress have also had him as expert witness
[1:10:41.400 --> 1:10:46.120]  so he is uniquely positioned as probably the biggest nsa whistleblower most people never
[1:10:46.120 --> 1:10:51.640]  heard about you hear about snowden all day but but madson was blowing the whistle back when
[1:10:51.640 --> 1:10:56.200]  they didn't arrest you for exposing criminal activity 20 years ago when he left the national
[1:10:56.200 --> 1:11:02.040]  security agency before that he was in uh electronic anti-submarine warfare operations
[1:11:02.040 --> 1:11:06.120]  in highly classified areas of the navy and of course he's a frequent guest here on the broadcast
[1:11:06.120 --> 1:11:10.440]  and i appreciate him coming on on short notice i just thought hey we ought to get wane madson's
[1:11:10.440 --> 1:11:15.480]  take on this all i knew months ago was they would you show what the proposal was and i said i don't
[1:11:15.480 --> 1:11:21.400]  want the fcc over the internet use antitrust laws on these big corporations that are already there
[1:11:21.400 --> 1:11:28.040]  that they can't stop people's information going down the internet if someone violates a law those
[1:11:28.040 --> 1:11:33.400]  laws are on the books well that's basically what commissioner pie and others are saying we're going
[1:11:33.400 --> 1:11:39.240]  to find out wane madson's view on this and then take calls on this subject uh and others uh wane
[1:11:39.240 --> 1:11:45.240]  madson what is your take with wane madson report dot com what is your take on what's happening right
[1:11:45.240 --> 1:11:53.560]  now well i wish we could freeze the current status quo without any sort of uh my fear is that uh
[1:11:53.560 --> 1:12:00.120]  there's been a lot of lobbyists involved with crafting uh these uh fcc regulations i think
[1:12:00.120 --> 1:12:06.520]  there's arguments on both sides of this here here here and i i was involved in this peripherally
[1:12:06.520 --> 1:12:11.640]  when i was with the electronic privacy information center years ago that the issue of net neutrality
[1:12:11.640 --> 1:12:18.440]  came up and isn't that the group that turned into efs uh no well that they actually work together
[1:12:18.440 --> 1:12:24.280]  they're two separate groups some of the epic people went over to efs so there's been some cross
[1:12:24.280 --> 1:12:31.640]  pollination there uh but they all basically uh agree uh that there ought to be net neutrality
[1:12:31.640 --> 1:12:36.840]  uh where i and i i don't know their current take on as is the ff is now coming out saying they
[1:12:36.840 --> 1:12:43.880]  don't like the current plan because uh go ahead they probably i'm probably in agreement with
[1:12:43.880 --> 1:12:50.680]  their stance here's the problem the problem is that currently without any sort of um because
[1:12:50.680 --> 1:12:55.960]  it's out there the internet is out there to be preyed upon by the comcasts of the world and we
[1:12:55.960 --> 1:13:01.640]  know what their their intention is they want to create these uh multi-tiered systems of bandwidth
[1:13:01.640 --> 1:13:09.320]  access throughput and if we if we if we have that situation uh small websites like the one i run
[1:13:09.320 --> 1:13:15.400]  and and and others out there are going to be relegated down with the slow throughput uh the
[1:13:15.400 --> 1:13:22.920]  comcasts the hollywood studios are going to get the high bandwidth uh throughput and uh and and and
[1:13:22.920 --> 1:13:28.760]  so good content or at least independent content on the internet will be smothered sure that's the
[1:13:28.760 --> 1:13:34.520]  internet too and so at one level globally they're trying to do that and then have a censored controlled
[1:13:34.520 --> 1:13:39.960]  multi-tier system then the FCC comes in as quote the savior but then that will give them regulatory
[1:13:39.960 --> 1:13:45.720]  power so they can then quote compromise and bring in the comcast plan and here's the pride and that's
[1:13:45.720 --> 1:13:52.520]  the problem because if you get the FCC involved in regulating content this is the slippery slope
[1:13:52.520 --> 1:13:59.480]  because we know the FCC regulates content on uh the broadcast network so on the radio frequency
[1:13:59.480 --> 1:14:04.920]  spectrum on television and radio that's why you know you can't say those seven words that george
[1:14:04.920 --> 1:14:10.040]  carlin talked about uh personally i i don't care if you don't like what you hear on the radio or
[1:14:10.040 --> 1:14:16.760]  television turn it off or turn to another station uh but i'm i'm really afraid that this could be
[1:14:16.760 --> 1:14:20.680]  opening the door for other lobbyists who represent let's face it i'm going to be
[1:14:20.680 --> 1:14:27.160]  right out in front on this one uh those thin skin belly acres from the southern poverty law center
[1:14:27.160 --> 1:14:33.160]  and the anti-defamation league who will start crying about content and they may try to use
[1:14:33.160 --> 1:14:40.440]  the FCC to regulate content on the internet uh and that's where i think uh this could wind up
[1:14:40.440 --> 1:14:46.440]  because i i think like i say i wish we could just freeze the current status quo without any
[1:14:46.440 --> 1:14:51.880]  without any sort of uh lobbyist involvement or major companies like comcast and berizon getting
[1:14:51.880 --> 1:14:58.360]  involved but that obviously isn't the case because we have this you know multi hundred page document
[1:14:58.360 --> 1:15:02.440]  that's been prepared that's done uh uh you know the devils are going to be in the detail on this
[1:15:02.440 --> 1:15:08.920]  one alex too well isn't it tell tale that he won't testify before congress the FCC chairman
[1:15:08.920 --> 1:15:13.880]  and the 322 pages is secret i mean right there you shouldn't be able to pass something that's
[1:15:13.880 --> 1:15:19.800]  secret yeah and the guy the guy who's the FCC chairman of course obama picked him uh he you
[1:15:19.800 --> 1:15:25.880]  know he's a he's a former uh communications industry lobbyist i mean he comes right out of
[1:15:25.880 --> 1:15:32.200]  the comcast world so i wouldn't trust anything on his uh on his his silver platter whatever he's
[1:15:32.200 --> 1:15:40.760]  offering up uh like i say uh i i think uh what you said it's not broke right now why try to fix it
[1:15:40.760 --> 1:15:45.640]  and i wish we could just freeze the the current status quo but that's obviously not going and
[1:15:45.640 --> 1:15:53.400]  going on in dc right now let me ask you this question more and more on every front the
[1:15:53.400 --> 1:15:58.440]  globalist interests are accelerating their program to a reckless level 80 you agree with
[1:15:58.440 --> 1:16:04.760]  that statement and b why do you think every globalist project is being put into overdrive right now
[1:16:04.760 --> 1:16:11.320]  oh well look you know the the globalists are afraid right now look what's happening in europe
[1:16:11.320 --> 1:16:17.880]  with greece i mean the greeks unfortunately buckled uh they had this new government they
[1:16:17.880 --> 1:16:22.680]  they said look we're not going to play around with these bankers and this austerity but it looks like
[1:16:22.680 --> 1:16:28.680]  they you know and in the 11th hour they kept this deal but it's you know these are like the
[1:16:28.680 --> 1:16:35.240]  uh the the little dutch boy trying to keep his finger plugged in the dam because there's leaks
[1:16:35.240 --> 1:16:40.360]  springing up all over the world and and they're getting frankly very very nervous about what's
[1:16:40.360 --> 1:16:49.640]  going on elaborate on the greece german situation well what we had in a victory of syriza that's
[1:16:49.640 --> 1:16:55.240]  the far left party in greece it was an anti austerity vote you know greece has been told to
[1:16:55.240 --> 1:17:01.160]  sell off all their public sector assets everything from the ports which they were forced to sell to
[1:17:01.160 --> 1:17:09.800]  the chinese uh to airports to ferry systems you name it hospitals everything was on the the chopping
[1:17:09.800 --> 1:17:17.320]  block uh they they wanted to do to greece what's going on in ukraine right now selling public
[1:17:17.320 --> 1:17:22.920]  assets for like pennies to the dollar and the only people that were making out were these
[1:17:22.920 --> 1:17:29.400]  you know globalist bankers in frankfurt the european central bank the eu and the imf what
[1:17:29.400 --> 1:17:35.320]  they call in greece the troika the imf the european union and the european central bank
[1:17:35.320 --> 1:17:40.040]  and and and there have been people on pensions in greece have been thrown off their pensions
[1:17:40.040 --> 1:17:45.560]  they're not they don't have money to get their prescriptions uh i mean it's been devastating so
[1:17:45.560 --> 1:17:51.480]  they the greek people elected an anti austerity government but what did they do at the 11th hour
[1:17:51.480 --> 1:17:56.760]  instead of just saying the heck with the eu we're pulling out we're going to reestablish the drachma
[1:17:56.760 --> 1:18:03.240]  our old current our old currency as our monetary unit they cut this terrible deal which means that
[1:18:03.240 --> 1:18:10.440]  greece will continue with this austerity program what what who who's next well uh in spain italy
[1:18:10.440 --> 1:18:16.360]  ireland belgium france all facing this too uh either in france you've got the rise of the
[1:18:16.360 --> 1:18:22.920]  national front the right wing party which is supposedly against uh these eu austerity programs
[1:18:22.920 --> 1:18:30.120]  in spain as podemos which is again like the greek left leftist party but you in other words in
[1:18:30.120 --> 1:18:36.200]  various countries around what around european in fact around the world you're seeing the population
[1:18:36.840 --> 1:18:42.920]  going to either the left or to the right because they're sick and tired of this status quo
[1:18:42.920 --> 1:18:48.280]  uh that's been engineered by these globalists what they're going to is a nationalist anti
[1:18:48.280 --> 1:18:52.600]  austerity parties and when you analyze the greek debt and others as you've done
[1:18:53.240 --> 1:18:59.720]  now that economist on 90 percent whether it's iceland whether it's greece whether it's ireland
[1:18:59.720 --> 1:19:05.000]  whether it's spain whether it's portugal 90 to 93 of the debt it's always the same globalist formula
[1:19:05.000 --> 1:19:14.200]  is a fraudulent derivatives credit default swap or other derivative trash counterfeit that
[1:19:15.160 --> 1:19:21.400]  goldman sacks in almost every case operatives have had the president or prime minister
[1:19:21.400 --> 1:19:28.120]  sign the people on to quote bail out the banks but then it's their debt to the very bankers they
[1:19:28.120 --> 1:19:32.920]  just bailed out and so their pension funds get rated or they've got to bail in and give money
[1:19:32.920 --> 1:19:37.880]  to the banks i mean this screw job is so epic it makes my head spin we come back wane i want to

[1:24:10.920 --> 1:24:15.000]  it's a classic dialectic where you control both sides of the argument to
[1:24:16.200 --> 1:24:19.640]  then create a synthesis that is the end game that you wanted to begin with
[1:24:20.360 --> 1:24:25.160]  the galleon dialectic a problem reaction solution is astralian economic
[1:24:27.480 --> 1:24:35.480]  system that is deployed as almost a fix all for the global social engineers in my view
[1:24:35.480 --> 1:24:41.400]  and it's very transparent there's a plan to create a two-tier censored controlled hyperfast
[1:24:41.400 --> 1:24:48.200]  internet it's already in place in south korea and other areas have people opt in wave their
[1:24:48.200 --> 1:24:56.280]  rights and be surveilled and then basically have a sub web that is falling apart choked with
[1:24:56.280 --> 1:25:03.160]  different tolls and regulated as well and so they have the comcast and others come in and try to push
[1:25:03.160 --> 1:25:11.080]  push this hijacking creating dams in the middle of the internet then congress comes in to quote
[1:25:11.080 --> 1:25:15.640]  save us but they don't they let the FCC and agency come in and just say don't worry we're
[1:25:15.640 --> 1:25:21.960]  going to declare regulatory power over this without congress even passing a law so it's a
[1:25:21.960 --> 1:25:26.440]  constitutional crisis in that it's the FCC declaring they're just going to do this
[1:25:26.440 --> 1:25:33.080]  and then we talk about FCC appeals when they don't have this regulatory power
[1:25:33.640 --> 1:25:39.640]  and we've got the former head lawyer joining us monday for the FCC bruce fine he's the guy
[1:25:39.640 --> 1:25:47.160]  that got rid of net neutrality in 1987 so we can defeat this but wane what does it signify in the
[1:25:47.160 --> 1:25:51.320]  world right now i know i brought up another subject has went to break i want to go back into
[1:25:51.320 --> 1:25:56.360]  this for a moment in this short segment what does it signify though that they're trying this and
[1:25:56.360 --> 1:26:01.400]  if the globalists are in such crisis looking into your crystal ball talking to other experts where
[1:26:01.400 --> 1:26:06.760]  do you see the world going what are we about to see the next few years well i mean if you were to
[1:26:06.760 --> 1:26:12.120]  if you were to sneak in uh to say the builder bird you know what you actually are inside
[1:26:12.120 --> 1:26:18.600]  listening to these people these elitists or the davos world economic forum or any number of these
[1:26:18.600 --> 1:26:26.360]  uh i i dare say that's been discussed at the bohemian grove uh between you know naked roms
[1:26:26.360 --> 1:26:32.520]  in the forest uh they're probably saying what are we going to do about this internet because
[1:26:32.520 --> 1:26:40.360]  you know it's this fairly independent means of communications where the nation state as a matter
[1:26:40.360 --> 1:26:49.400]  of fact just last week three fossils uh henry kissinger speaking of brzezinski and brensko cropped
[1:26:50.360 --> 1:26:57.080]  were testifying before john mccain and john mccain is very much in you know in bed with these
[1:26:57.080 --> 1:27:04.920]  comcasts of the world on on the internet and both all three of these ancient fossils said
[1:27:04.920 --> 1:27:12.040]  they're concerned about the west failures system being uh threatened by social media
[1:27:12.600 --> 1:27:16.040]  and what are they talking about talking about the internet and what you're talking about with
[1:27:16.040 --> 1:27:23.080]  the treaty of west failure this isn't this was concluded in 1648 this gives you some idea of
[1:27:23.080 --> 1:27:29.240]  the uh of the you know these people living in the past they want to return to feudalism
[1:27:29.240 --> 1:27:37.000]  um they want to return to chattel systems um and they're concerned so so when they're talking
[1:27:37.000 --> 1:27:45.080]  about the treaty of west failure from 1648 uh they they want their their their feeling is
[1:27:45.080 --> 1:27:49.480]  that the nation state is being threatened and right now we don't really have in europe for
[1:27:49.480 --> 1:27:54.760]  example we don't have a nation state we got a super national uh group called the european union
[1:27:54.760 --> 1:28:00.440]  which consists of a lot of nation states and i i think basically what they're afraid of is that
[1:28:00.440 --> 1:28:07.400]  the EU is going to fall apart uh all this uh western hemisphere nafta and kafta and the
[1:28:07.400 --> 1:28:11.960]  trans-pacific partnership and the transatlantic trade partnership all this stuff is going to
[1:28:11.960 --> 1:28:17.960]  come to a screeching halt because the people are going to say no that's our jobs uh that's our way
[1:28:17.960 --> 1:28:22.920]  of life that's our standard of living that's our cultural identity too that's what russia's upset
[1:28:22.920 --> 1:28:28.360]  about being trying you know where they're trying to force feed russia to adopt uh standards they're
[1:28:28.360 --> 1:28:33.080]  trying to force them to take political correctness open borders and russia just isn't buying it and
[1:28:33.080 --> 1:28:36.760]  expanding on that you're absolutely right for those that don't know it was about nine years ago
[1:28:36.760 --> 1:28:41.000]  we're trying to find the article up to have found the exact headline to find it when it's that old
[1:28:41.000 --> 1:28:49.880]  but but remember he came out lobbying for Comcast and said we need a law with no proof basically
[1:28:49.880 --> 1:28:54.600]  was the law they wanted the Comcasts and the recording industries were proposing to quote
[1:28:54.600 --> 1:29:00.520]  blow up pirates computers that if you if they claim you've downloaded something illegally
[1:29:00.520 --> 1:29:05.720]  then they have they send a virus that fries your computer remember that he said quote blow up your
[1:29:05.720 --> 1:29:14.200]  computer yeah these people are insane uh you know but the the mere fact that you had a scope
[1:29:14.200 --> 1:29:20.280]  croft Kissinger and presence he testified before some shows they're scared yeah i mean you know and
[1:29:20.280 --> 1:29:26.120]  they have to haul these people out of the crypt to complain about how the the westphalian treaty
[1:29:26.120 --> 1:29:31.560]  system is being threatened by social media you know they're talking about you they're talking
[1:29:31.560 --> 1:29:36.520]  about me they're talking about everyone else out there uh who's got an independent voice well

[1:38:28.920 --> 1:38:35.480]  being one of the first 9-11 truthers demonized vilified drug through the mud pilloried attacked
[1:38:35.480 --> 1:38:40.120]  for saying that Saudi Arabia clearly had a major hand in it and that there was a stand down in the
[1:38:40.120 --> 1:38:45.640]  book you wrote in the interviews you've done for international national media in this show
[1:38:45.640 --> 1:38:52.040]  you were one of the first prominent 9-11 truthers covering real facts they sent in the well poisoners
[1:38:52.040 --> 1:38:56.440]  with ridiculous conspiracy theories who all attacked us and tried to discredit the message
[1:38:56.440 --> 1:39:02.120]  but now the 28 pages senator Graham head of the commission says Saudi Arabia quarterbacked it bare
[1:39:02.120 --> 1:39:08.520]  minimum and that our government bare minimum stood down we are vindicated what do you make of that
[1:39:08.520 --> 1:39:13.880]  and then are you worried about a new false flag yeah i'm i'm i'm worried about a new false flag
[1:39:13.880 --> 1:39:20.120]  but i'm yeah i was actually threatened with lawsuits from uh people in in Saudi Arabia
[1:39:21.080 --> 1:39:26.520]  a Saudi shake for example because i had written about the the involvement of some of these Saudi
[1:39:26.520 --> 1:39:35.080]  banks Saudi bankers the members of the uh saloon family in 9-11 the current king of Saudi Arabia
[1:39:35.080 --> 1:39:41.560]  i tagged him as facilitating the transfer of members of al-qaeda through riyadh when he was
[1:39:41.560 --> 1:39:47.800]  governor of the riyadh province to uh pakistan and afghanistan uh paying their plane fare to for
[1:39:47.800 --> 1:39:53.000]  their plane uh giving them their tickets they're uh paying for their hotel rooms giving them cash
[1:39:53.000 --> 1:39:58.120]  he's the current king king salmon not to be confused with what you catch out in the the
[1:39:58.120 --> 1:40:05.480]  puget sounds in the mcnorthwest but uh i believe me those summons those some those king salmon smell
[1:40:05.480 --> 1:40:12.520]  a lot better than king salmon of Saudi Arabia uh but uh yeah look i i mean i i i had very good
[1:40:12.520 --> 1:40:19.400]  sources back then that were trying to tell me this was going on uh and uh i just uh i i i feel good
[1:40:19.400 --> 1:40:24.200]  that they're vindicated uh more so than myself talking about springman and others ahead of the
[1:40:24.200 --> 1:40:28.920]  u.s embassy what's what yeah springman was one of many uh there but there were so many back in
[1:40:28.920 --> 1:40:35.800]  the colonel butler yeah yeah i mean they're just uh i think back on some unfortunately some of them
[1:40:35.800 --> 1:40:41.160]  are no longer with us some of you know kind of uh gotten out of the mainstream they got beat up so
[1:40:41.160 --> 1:40:45.720]  bad they decided to get out of and these are people there that watched it all happen i mean
[1:40:45.720 --> 1:40:52.120]  these were eyewitnesses yeah i mean they were uh and and some of them are still around but many
[1:40:52.120 --> 1:40:58.040]  of them uh left the military left the intelligence services uh you know it'd be nice they talk about
[1:40:58.040 --> 1:41:03.720]  putting up memorials i'd like to see a memorial put up to those uh nine eleven truth people who
[1:41:03.720 --> 1:41:09.880]  you know suffered immensely uh and some of them are you know are dead and i think suspiciously
[1:41:09.880 --> 1:41:15.240]  oh remember uh barry jennings two weeks after he was on the show you know we aired the interview that
[1:41:15.240 --> 1:41:19.880]  our crew i was producing loose change uh second edition then and we interviewed him aired the
[1:41:19.880 --> 1:41:25.160]  thing and he was dead two weeks later yeah even gene pawfrey the dc manum told me she had information
[1:41:25.160 --> 1:41:28.440]  that would have been of interest to the nine eleven commission about you were on the show
[1:41:28.440 --> 1:41:32.680]  whether that day and i said listen they might kill you and i said you'll never commit suicide
[1:41:32.680 --> 1:41:38.280]  she said never and i mean and i remember i had the police detectives call me i had uh her condo
[1:41:38.280 --> 1:41:43.240]  manager call me and say no no she was leaving they were after her he sent me her handwriting
[1:41:43.240 --> 1:41:49.720]  looked nothing like her suicide note right there was uh fbi agent shadow neil that was on the trail
[1:41:49.720 --> 1:41:54.600]  the saudis early on you knew pal free by the way quite well let let's let's let's remember
[1:41:54.600 --> 1:42:00.840]  the dc madam here yeah i mean there's a it's a long long list uh but what there's still
[1:42:00.840 --> 1:42:06.920]  reluctance to release those twenty eight pages and uh i pretty much been told what's in the
[1:42:06.920 --> 1:42:13.960]  months no no surprise to me where where these roads lead and uh you know uh it'd be nice to
[1:42:13.960 --> 1:42:18.920]  see the pages come out but i think it's going to be anticlimactic when uh when they do uh when
[1:42:18.920 --> 1:42:22.760]  they do our release because we're going to say yeah we already knew that stuff but we're not
[1:42:22.760 --> 1:42:28.360]  going to get apologized to by cnn fox news glenn back i mean i mean really glenn glenn come on
[1:42:28.360 --> 1:42:35.240]  do i get an apology no well some of those guys i i i haven't been a shot in freuda right now with
[1:42:35.240 --> 1:42:42.280]  some of them like brian williams and billow riley uh you know a lion about their their war records
[1:42:42.280 --> 1:42:47.000]  and you know riley trying to claim you he was standing outside a more more demoralized shield's
[1:42:47.000 --> 1:42:53.240]  house when he committed suicide before he was supposed to testify uh before the house select
[1:42:53.240 --> 1:42:58.760]  committee on assassinations i mean you know if we if we've been able to get these two figures how
[1:42:58.760 --> 1:43:03.720]  many others are there like them that lie about everything what about what about ryan williams
[1:43:03.720 --> 1:43:07.960]  what's your view on him i mean when he came out and tried to say i mean you know i misremembered
[1:43:07.960 --> 1:43:12.200]  being hit by a missile when he was an hour and a half actually behind it i mean that is just an
[1:43:12.200 --> 1:43:19.160]  insane lie yeah i mean who that's like saying i was in the uh fertilizer plant exposed explosion
[1:43:19.160 --> 1:43:25.240]  in in the town of west texas that's a hundred miles away yeah exactly i mean the thing is uh
[1:43:25.240 --> 1:43:30.120]  and you know poor dan rather got they got the run out of the the business because he happened to have
[1:43:30.120 --> 1:43:36.200]  told the truth that look you know of course some of the evidence was problematic it was he had about
[1:43:36.200 --> 1:43:42.440]  20 pieces and we know carl rove spiked one piece of this info yeah so there's the there's the corporate
[1:43:42.440 --> 1:43:48.680]  media for you you know they they they they promote the uh the ne'er-do-wells the people who make up
[1:43:48.680 --> 1:43:55.080]  stories uh and those who try to report the news are you know shown the exit uh you know the exit
[1:43:55.080 --> 1:44:02.120]  door um i anyone who look i i i'm going to predict right now that in i think in two years there will
[1:44:02.120 --> 1:44:08.680]  no longer be the half hour broadcast uh evening news shows i think they're they're they're just
[1:44:08.680 --> 1:44:15.400]  ridiculous uh do you think ryan williams will be seen as the bell weather mark point in which the
[1:44:15.400 --> 1:44:20.920]  dying dinosaur media finally collapsed into a rotten heap yeah i think i think nbc will probably
[1:44:20.920 --> 1:44:27.080]  be the first to get rid of its uh nightly news followed probably by um a abc we'll see an ends
[1:44:27.080 --> 1:44:33.240]  already segueing out to cooking shows and travel shows oh yeah i mean yeah that then and msnbc does
[1:44:33.240 --> 1:44:38.280]  the lockup shows on the weekends you know and even the weather channel we get you know coast guard
[1:44:38.280 --> 1:44:45.080]  guys in alaska what is this crap see that getting back to the internet and and and that neutrality
[1:44:45.080 --> 1:44:50.120]  that's what i'm i i would hope that the internet doesn't become that kind of garbage but i think
[1:44:50.120 --> 1:44:55.960]  there are people with you know the hollywood crowd and the music industry would like to
[1:44:55.960 --> 1:45:01.080]  turn the internet into a reservoir of garbage like uh we see on cable tv today we can see the
[1:45:01.080 --> 1:45:05.000]  metric of what they call conspiracy news that means anything that doesn't fit with the official
[1:45:05.000 --> 1:45:09.880]  narrative it's what's growing uh i mean i don't think this is something they can get rid of i
[1:45:09.880 --> 1:45:13.960]  don't think that if they were losing the info war four years ago in hillary's words to congress
[1:45:13.960 --> 1:45:19.720]  when she testified i think now we're really hurting them bad well i try to regulate the internet i
[1:45:19.720 --> 1:45:26.040]  keep my backup i have my old woodstock manual typewriter i'll just start uh doing my stories on
[1:45:26.040 --> 1:45:30.440]  on that and send it out by snail mail you know well we know the soviet union got crippled by
[1:45:30.440 --> 1:45:34.680]  people with fax machines handing out printouts just saying the government lied about this the
[1:45:34.680 --> 1:45:39.640]  government lied about that that's why everybody should always have an arm of their media operation
[1:45:39.640 --> 1:45:45.000]  it's low tech absolutely oh yeah i mean if they ever shut me off or anything i'll launch an initiative
[1:45:45.000 --> 1:45:51.160]  people door to door to put handbills up everywhere so fast they can't stop us yeah i wanted i'm i'm
[1:45:51.160 --> 1:45:57.320]  actually thinking back on to some uh some garage sales and antiques stores to see if i can get those
[1:45:57.320 --> 1:46:03.320]  old mime grab machines they used to have when i was back in grade school and junior high by the way
[1:46:03.320 --> 1:46:07.800]  i'm sure you saw that germany and russia are actually buying typewriters for the super secret
[1:46:07.800 --> 1:46:12.920]  communications but the big secret is france already uses underground pneumatic tube for anything
[1:46:12.920 --> 1:46:19.640]  considered secret exactly exactly i wouldn't be surprised to see uh a lot of countries going back
[1:46:19.640 --> 1:46:24.760]  to what we used to use those in the in the military even in the intelligence community called they
[1:46:24.760 --> 1:46:29.640]  called bunny tubes where you put your messages in these pneumatic tubes and send them from
[1:46:29.640 --> 1:46:35.480]  one building to another one room to another yeah my dad strangely definitely was in france
[1:46:36.280 --> 1:46:40.360]  wanted to see get a tour of the sirs but it's not the actual sirs it's the old you know
[1:46:40.360 --> 1:46:44.600]  500 year old ones and there was a big turd he went down and they were like and i was like what's
[1:46:44.600 --> 1:46:48.440]  these tubes they go that's for secret communications he just said they were just just scores of them
[1:46:48.440 --> 1:46:53.080]  this was like five years ago they're they're very effective as long as some clown as we've had on
[1:46:53.080 --> 1:46:58.760]  men had in many occasions as long as some clown didn't put a banana or an apple in this thing because
[1:46:58.760 --> 1:47:04.440]  you wind up with banana mush or apple sauce on the other end oh so sometimes people even the
[1:47:04.440 --> 1:47:09.240]  agencies themselves would do that oh sure have you heard about this epidemic in federal agencies
[1:47:09.240 --> 1:47:14.520]  of people crapping on the floor uh the phantom crappers uh well we what if they did that the
[1:47:14.520 --> 1:47:20.360]  pneumatic tube yeah we had well i yeah we we had a lot of funny things show up in the pneumatic tubes
[1:47:22.280 --> 1:47:26.760]  yeah well there were stories i mean i remember that back in the barracks in the in the in the
[1:47:26.760 --> 1:47:33.240]  in the navy there were those phantom people that did such things but uh i mean why why do you
[1:47:33.240 --> 1:47:39.640]  want to if you want to be cracked on just turn on the cnn and get the latest press conference from
[1:47:39.640 --> 1:47:44.680]  the white house or turn into mrs maddow or mr maddow he'll certainly get crap on you know i know
[1:47:44.680 --> 1:47:49.240]  it's ridiculous i'm sorry for the potty humor folks you gotta have some gallows humor hey let's
[1:47:49.240 --> 1:47:53.720]  let's take a few phone calls wane sure all right wane madson's our guest next hour i'll get into
[1:47:53.720 --> 1:47:58.120]  the secret have you heard it's even on mainstream news they found secret black sites that the police
[1:47:58.120 --> 1:48:03.880]  have for interrogating people in chicago yeah and i'm i'm really happy that arama manuel was kept
[1:48:03.880 --> 1:48:09.800]  under 50 he's forced into a runoff and i would hope that anybody who's a voter in chicago would vote
[1:48:09.800 --> 1:48:17.240]  for uh heizl's uh joey uh garcia i believe that's his name i may have the last name wrong i hope i
[1:48:17.240 --> 1:48:25.080]  don't but uh he came out of basically nowhere and and and and kept immanuel under 50 so they're
[1:48:25.080 --> 1:48:31.560]  going to go into a runoff and i would hope that the um that shui becomes the next mayor of chicago
[1:48:31.560 --> 1:48:35.560]  and gets rid of that non well it's a good star wars tie and now is this mayor seven and a half
[1:48:35.560 --> 1:48:43.720]  feet tall and harry i i mean uh immanuel is just uh that he's just sold the city of chicago to
[1:48:43.720 --> 1:48:47.880]  you know the the highest there was a total gangster i mean for the folks that don't know
[1:48:47.880 --> 1:48:52.680]  this was even in mainstream news that he would flip out in meetings and and start under clinton
[1:48:52.680 --> 1:48:57.240]  and start stabbing the the the table with knives foaming at the mouth and he would tell obama
[1:48:57.240 --> 1:49:02.520]  to shut up and try to congressional uh you know closed door meetings with obama i mean he is crazy
[1:49:03.080 --> 1:49:09.080]  yeah and obama showed up in chicago to campaign form but apparently uh as i wrote today on my
[1:49:09.080 --> 1:49:15.400]  website uh where obama thought he um uh had coattails out there it turns out he he didn't
[1:49:15.400 --> 1:49:21.320]  even have a ferry loop to help uh to help hold him on you now now did immanuel and obama drop
[1:49:21.320 --> 1:49:25.400]  by the bathhouses like they normally did i don't know they might have discussed old times up there

[1:54:00.520 --> 1:54:06.520]  with isis our government created al-qaeda that became isis how ridiculous is this as they say

[1:54:11.320 --> 1:54:17.160]  dhs when this is the very remember years ago we predicted that al-qaeda in syria would turn
[1:54:17.160 --> 1:54:23.880]  against the west now they've done it yeah and and you know i i just wrote that recently out of out
[1:54:23.880 --> 1:54:32.600]  of the uh 11 recent cases of these lone wolf attacks uh france uh australia canada denmark
[1:54:32.600 --> 1:54:41.560]  uh brussels uh that not uh all 11 of them were had were known to intelligence agencies were
[1:54:41.560 --> 1:54:47.880]  known to law enforcement as some were probably informants uh agents and and and nine of those
[1:54:47.880 --> 1:54:53.800]  11 are now dead uh that's right they're patsy's just like boston bombing yeah i mean the older
[1:54:53.800 --> 1:55:00.440]  brother was on cia payroll uh sent to uh sent to the caucuses i mean the russia blew his cover
[1:55:00.440 --> 1:55:06.200]  two years before the boston bombing absolutely wane madson wane madson report.com folks can
[1:55:06.200 --> 1:55:10.680]  find all your books there they're excellent uh tell us briefly about your newest book uh it's
[1:55:10.680 --> 1:55:17.080]  basically a compendium of stories i've covered over the last 10 years um of the cia knocking off
[1:55:17.080 --> 1:55:25.160]  world leaders politicians and even uh people who were professionals not politicians so it's called
[1:55:25.160 --> 1:55:30.040]  tales from the cia crypt well well done we'll get you on to do a whole interview on that in the
[1:55:30.040 --> 1:55:33.400]  near future in fact let's try to set him up now for about two weeks from now wane thank you my
[1:55:33.400 --> 1:55:41.880]  friend good to be with you alex always informative um it's just amazing how they're preparing al-qaeda
[1:55:41.880 --> 1:55:48.600]  under the new name isis to strike the west and it'll be real people that come and attack us but
[1:55:48.600 --> 1:55:54.040]  the door is being opened it could be real people i think the preponderance of evidence
[1:55:54.040 --> 1:56:00.360]  shows they're getting some real groups ready to attack wind up toys i call them or they call them but
[1:56:01.240 --> 1:56:06.040]  they could also pull a really big fake one like 9-11 this is the saudi thing which is to cut out
[1:56:06.920 --> 1:56:15.320]  the head of the u.s. embassy visa section was told was told no these are cia officers not assets
[1:56:15.320 --> 1:56:21.880]  and that's why they have a terror designation give them the visa i mean i've interviewed springman
[1:56:21.880 --> 1:56:27.880]  here and that's going to come out the 28 pages folks they were protected now do they actually
[1:56:27.880 --> 1:56:33.720]  hijacked those planes the only two air phone calls that were real said there's gas i can't breathe

[1:56:44.360 --> 1:56:49.880]  i believe were they triple agents than actually hijacked that's a low probability but could
[1:56:49.880 --> 1:56:58.520]  have happened the money's on remote control and nerve gas that's what the smart money's on
[1:56:59.800 --> 1:57:05.240]  who did it that's another question but norab was ordered to stand down and that's public
[1:57:07.800 --> 1:57:11.080]  you think it's fun coming out with this information you think i like risking my life

[2:00:49.320 --> 2:00:54.280]  involved in the internet when it's an out of control agency like the fcc historically
[2:00:54.280 --> 2:01:04.680]  a draconian operation and what they want to pass in their committee not even congress but
[2:01:04.680 --> 2:01:11.000]  the fcc that they say has passed they're going to announce tomorrow is 322 pages in a secret

[2:01:28.280 --> 2:01:32.280]  will have some bad stuff in it but it's just the fact that they're asserting that they have the
[2:01:32.280 --> 2:01:40.280]  jurisdiction when the same corporations need government as a cover to put this into law
[2:01:40.280 --> 2:01:46.040]  they've tried to act unilaterally to end net neutrality comcast time Warner and others
[2:01:46.040 --> 2:01:53.720]  they've been unable so now they want the government to do it in the name of saving it
[2:01:54.840 --> 2:01:59.000]  just like they stage the terror attacks or provocatum or allow them to happen
[2:01:59.000 --> 2:02:05.320]  to then take over i mean it's real simple spencer in canada you're on the air go ahead

[2:03:35.720 --> 2:03:40.040]  trying to pass it right now and it's gone into like the second round and um in our parliament but
[2:03:40.680 --> 2:03:44.600]  it's really scary it's our new anti-terrorism laws that they put together and a lot of people are
[2:03:44.600 --> 2:03:48.760]  saying it's going to strip our rights but if you don't mind i could just read a couple of uh
[2:03:48.760 --> 2:03:55.080]  sure and that was all because of the shooter that shot the the the military man guarding the parliament
[2:03:55.080 --> 2:03:59.640]  a few months ago and now they're trying to pass uh their own draconian piece of legislation please
[2:03:59.640 --> 2:04:05.000]  read from it uh so a couple of the points that were pointed out by some of our people in parliament
[2:04:05.000 --> 2:04:10.360]  that they said were a risk to our freedoms and rights uh one is uh allowing secure a canadian
[2:04:10.360 --> 2:04:15.480]  security intelligence services uh service agents to conduct warrantless conducts and operations

[2:08:49.800 --> 2:08:54.840]  every day i see stuff like this major university study out of canada
[2:08:57.800 --> 2:09:02.920]  came out last week on fluoride reducing iq just like the harvard one two years ago
[2:09:02.920 --> 2:09:08.360]  and then two days ago the london telegraph reported we reported on as well
[2:09:08.360 --> 2:09:15.080]  that it makes you sick and depressed and gives you thyroid problems when you drink fluoride
[2:09:15.080 --> 2:09:20.280]  in the tap water i mean look at that unbelievable headline fluoride and drinking water may trigger
[2:09:20.280 --> 2:09:31.400]  depression and weight gain warn scientist unbelievable but if you go down to the city
[2:09:31.400 --> 2:09:35.960]  council we got a new mayor now so maybe you won't laugh at us i was downtown today and saw like
[2:09:35.960 --> 2:09:39.960]  well like secret service guys with guns the hands on their guns and looking around and it was
[2:09:40.680 --> 2:09:42.440]  it was the mayor getting out of a black
[2:09:44.040 --> 2:09:50.680]  tahoe and going into google the google command base like he was the president or something
[2:09:51.480 --> 2:09:54.680]  but i think of the austin mayors because we'd go down there with scientists and
[2:09:55.240 --> 2:10:00.760]  the head toxicologist of prestigious university and then he would just laugh at us and then flip
[2:10:00.760 --> 2:10:08.120]  us off meanwhile we just are bathing we're drowning and just documents and proof and
[2:10:08.120 --> 2:10:15.000]  just they're just laughing at everything we say oh city of austin is going to pay 1.3 million a year
[2:10:15.000 --> 2:10:22.920]  to buy toxic fluoride from fertilizer mines in florida's where we get ours mixed with hundreds
[2:10:22.920 --> 2:10:27.320]  of other deadly chemicals and then we're going to dump it in the water supply we're going to
[2:10:27.320 --> 2:10:33.400]  you're going to pay for it and i got to buy water filters to filter my water just so my kids don't
[2:10:33.400 --> 2:10:39.320]  you know drink it i mean you're a punk laughing well the new mayor i don't know he's a punk we'll
[2:10:39.320 --> 2:10:45.720]  see if he flips us off and here is doctor connet the head of his university's toxicology department
[2:10:45.720 --> 2:10:51.720]  to prestigious scientists to bring and then laughing wells oh thank you doctor you don't
[2:10:51.720 --> 2:11:00.200]  mind if i leave while you speak i mean that's that's the still the trolls are going to get what i
[2:11:00.200 --> 2:11:07.480]  just did feeding the trolls is very important they're pollinators because see we're in a paradigm
[2:11:07.480 --> 2:11:16.840]  above the cast sunstein school would you boys and so we actually understand the aroma that you put
[2:11:16.840 --> 2:11:22.840]  off actually attracts people to see what all the hubbub is about who was it said i don't care what
[2:11:22.840 --> 2:11:30.920]  you write about in the newspaper just spell my name correctly they've had no exaggeration probably 100
[2:11:30.920 --> 2:11:37.160]  news articles more than 100 and probably 15 tv shows that i personally have seen that this is
[2:11:37.160 --> 2:11:44.040]  just stalt number might be 20 where they make fun of me and say alex jones says juice boxes are going
[2:11:44.040 --> 2:11:50.840]  to make your children gay where they edited a tape where it looks like i'm saying that what i said
[2:11:50.840 --> 2:11:56.280]  was with about 15 20 30 whatever it was news articles because it was a video i did that probably
[2:11:56.280 --> 2:12:02.520]  had more than that probably 30 articles in it showing how mammals amphibians fish are having
[2:12:02.520 --> 2:12:09.960]  the reproductive systems fried and have both sets of genitalia in some cases it's so bad and and
[2:12:09.960 --> 2:12:17.080]  are going into puberty early or becoming fertile and reproducing early when they are in contact
[2:12:17.080 --> 2:12:22.920]  with the bisphenol a and see since you made fun of that five six years ago the bisphenol a is being
[2:12:22.920 --> 2:12:33.800]  jerked out of everything so you lose you fail how do you like them apples because see i'm not here
[2:12:33.800 --> 2:12:41.880]  to care about what happens to my name and my reputation i'm here to run over the barbed wire
[2:12:41.880 --> 2:12:46.120]  and throw hand grenades into your machine gun nest for the army that's coming up the hill
[2:12:47.560 --> 2:12:54.440]  and i don't care if i get blown up because in an info war i get resurrected over and over again
[2:12:54.440 --> 2:13:02.520]  i always get destroyed for a season but rise again in the spring just like the plants die in the
[2:13:02.520 --> 2:13:09.640]  winter they come back in the spring like the phoenix and that's why you don't have to worry when
[2:13:09.640 --> 2:13:17.640]  you're right day one exposing 9-11 as an inside job day one exposing fluoride day one exposing
[2:13:17.640 --> 2:13:23.240]  obama day one exposing the globalist agenda on every front because we know what we're talking about
[2:13:24.600 --> 2:13:28.440]  and i'm not worried about how they attack me up front and make me look like a fool
[2:13:28.440 --> 2:13:34.440]  it's all in god's plan because i never tried to act like a goofball on purpose i just do it
[2:13:34.440 --> 2:13:39.000]  sometimes i never tried to act silly i just do it sometimes i never tried to do all the
[2:13:39.000 --> 2:13:45.080]  annex i engage in that's just who i am but it all in god's greater plan worked out as bait
[2:13:46.680 --> 2:13:52.200]  to suck you guys in to try to destroy me over and over again everybody knows it's the hero
[2:13:52.200 --> 2:13:58.920]  that gets destroyed and i don't want to be a hero i want to teach other people how humanity
[2:13:58.920 --> 2:14:04.440]  is a hero men and women that stand up for decency and justice of the heroes people that do the right
[2:14:04.440 --> 2:14:07.720]  thing no matter what they get told by the establishment or what bullies say they're the
[2:14:07.720 --> 2:14:12.920]  heroes and i'm here to tell you you're a hero when you raise your children and love them and try to
[2:14:12.920 --> 2:14:17.960]  do the right thing and when you're not an envious evil person god loves you and i'm going to stop
[2:14:17.960 --> 2:14:26.120]  preaching here but i just start thinking about we're we're starting to win that's why the enemies
[2:14:26.120 --> 2:14:33.320]  tripled down we now pass the rubicon where almost no one is buying gmo crops and farmers are converting
[2:14:33.320 --> 2:14:40.760]  because of the market you can attack the french all you want but anybody tries to plant gmo in
[2:14:40.760 --> 2:14:46.200]  their area they burn down their crops that night they send in federal police try to stop them they
[2:14:46.200 --> 2:14:51.160]  burn down the police station and guess what the french government doesn't charge anybody because
[2:14:51.160 --> 2:14:58.440]  when they charge somebody more farmers come out because those french farmers buddy they've been
[2:14:58.440 --> 2:15:02.200]  on that land for a thousand years they know exactly what they're doing they know when they
[2:15:02.200 --> 2:15:06.760]  tested that stuff out and it kills their pigs kills their geese kills their cows they're not
[2:15:06.760 --> 2:15:11.880]  stupid and they will burn down anyone that tries to plant it well see that's the extreme over there
[2:15:11.880 --> 2:15:21.080]  and over here we are the dumping ground for all this stuff but it's changing and by voting with
[2:15:21.080 --> 2:15:28.120]  our dollars we're converting the market so now they want a new underclass of ignorant uneducated
[2:15:28.120 --> 2:15:32.760]  uninformed people that we can't communicate with out of latin america to be brought in who are the
[2:15:32.760 --> 2:15:37.640]  only people now eating at these facilities and i feel sorry for them we need to reach out to them
[2:15:37.640 --> 2:15:48.520]  and wake them up i mean i look at the news it is just an army of evidence i said i go to your calls
[2:15:50.200 --> 2:15:56.120]  spencer in canada i was holding he's at work i apologize the show is so unscripted i'm an
[2:15:56.120 --> 2:16:01.320]  animal i apologize spencer finish up with the incredible draconian bill c five one we pulled
[2:16:01.320 --> 2:16:05.320]  up news articles out of canada showing exactly what you said is in it secret arrest secretly
[2:16:05.320 --> 2:16:09.880]  disappearing frustrating uh quote groups that could become terrorist even though it may be
[2:16:09.880 --> 2:16:15.400]  illegal to break up protest groups breaking into people's houses sneak and peek uh recap that i
[2:16:15.400 --> 2:16:21.560]  apologize what's really scary about it is this one right here uh lower legal threshold for police
[2:16:21.560 --> 2:16:26.040]  to obtain a warrant to arrest individuals who have committed no crime and hold them in custody for
[2:16:26.040 --> 2:16:31.000]  up to seven days instead of the current maximum of three that pretty much means to me that if
[2:16:31.000 --> 2:16:36.520]  i'm walking on the street i can be arrested and put in jail for seven days on no crime whatsoever
[2:16:36.520 --> 2:16:44.600]  i mean that's terrifying holding her to be dangerous um another one it's uh place individuals names
[2:16:44.600 --> 2:16:48.760]  on no fly list if authorities learn they plan to travel abroad to join groups and then they
[2:16:48.760 --> 2:16:56.040]  specifically specify islamic state like that's scary i mean anybody can be accused of anything
[2:16:56.040 --> 2:17:04.120]  nowadays so what to stop them from putting anybody on this list it's amazing my friend
[2:17:04.120 --> 2:17:10.360]  any other points you want to go over um i mean i just think that uh you know i'm always talking

[2:17:14.120 --> 2:17:19.160]  listen to the alex joneshow and go on info wars dot com and and it's it's it's funny because i
[2:17:19.160 --> 2:17:22.760]  point all the facts out to my friends about getting vaccinated and they're always sick because
[2:17:22.760 --> 2:17:26.760]  they're getting their cold and flu shots of their tetanus shots and you know and there's me i'm never

[2:17:46.280 --> 2:17:51.160]  you know it's it's really sad nowadays that you know people can't see well just economically not
[2:17:51.160 --> 2:17:55.080]  just doing the right thing economically you'll end up being so much more successful than them
[2:17:55.080 --> 2:18:00.680]  i don't know any elitists that get vaccinated i mean they know what's going on listen i interrupted

[2:27:49.080 --> 2:27:55.560]  better than nothing absolutely or or or sea salt that hasn't in as great as well but i was thinking
[2:27:55.560 --> 2:28:01.880]  you guys could maybe use your secondary source and also um as far as the internet you can actually
[2:28:01.880 --> 2:28:08.280]  their services online you can order either flash drives or in bulk you can preload and

[2:29:00.120 --> 2:29:05.400]  magnifier that causes a snowball effect in intelligent circles where they'll put the meme out
[2:29:05.400 --> 2:29:10.200]  and then it's regurgitated and repeated by the parents who then flap around quacking feeling

[2:35:31.720 --> 2:35:39.480]  thing now where everyone's a secret agent everyone's jack bowler again i watched the mayor today
[2:35:41.800 --> 2:35:49.240]  was having me downtown and i saw this black suv pull up and you know these people jump out of it
[2:35:49.240 --> 2:35:52.920]  all like they were commandos you're getting into the childhood imagination like when i was five
[2:35:52.920 --> 2:35:58.280]  imagining i was a commando and handed their ears and their guns and badges and they run up to the
[2:35:58.280 --> 2:36:03.400]  google facility wanting to look powerful and big and they open the door and go in and check and
[2:36:03.400 --> 2:36:08.760]  i'm like who's going to get out of that car and it's the mayor the new mayor and then about 10
[2:36:08.760 --> 2:36:13.960]  minutes later he walks out everyone's staring oh my gosh it's like a new sign of power like an hip hop
[2:36:13.960 --> 2:36:22.360]  gangster rap to have like a crew with you your guards i mean what a joke now the mayor is running
[2:36:22.360 --> 2:36:31.160]  around you know with all these bodyguards it's ridiculous but that's the new status in the
[2:36:31.160 --> 2:36:36.520]  third world country i'll tell you when my dad was out in paraglade two years ago on an aid mission
[2:36:36.520 --> 2:36:42.760]  he does that in the third world sometimes going down to a free medical care everywhere they went
[2:36:42.760 --> 2:36:47.480]  in the green hell as it's known they would have like 15 to 20 bodyguards and the more money you
[2:36:47.480 --> 2:36:51.720]  have the more important the more bodyguards you have and they were meeting like the vice president
[2:36:51.720 --> 2:36:56.760]  it was like handing out awards you know ambassadorships and you know you can live here if you want or
[2:36:56.760 --> 2:37:03.480]  whatever that's some dinner he had like you know a hundred guards but a free society you don't see
[2:37:03.480 --> 2:37:08.680]  this i mean let me just tell you black uniforms guards everywhere that's called third world
[2:37:10.680 --> 2:37:13.720]  well i mean i don't need to use gross words in my
[2:37:13.720 --> 2:37:22.520]  semantical palette but when they do fit they fit third world sphincter
[2:37:23.880 --> 2:37:27.880]  and i'm just sitting there eating a breakfast taco this morning having a business meeting
[2:37:29.320 --> 2:37:33.880]  and i look and i go look at this look at these guys oh this is a very important person i bet
[2:37:34.840 --> 2:37:42.120]  roll my eyes and it was just the guys in suits like they were secret service dressed up on just
[2:37:42.120 --> 2:37:48.520]  such a power trip like they were on the red carpet like it was just a narcissistic and i'm not saying
[2:37:48.520 --> 2:37:51.560]  everybody in the secret service is not just narcissistic everybody in the awesome police
[2:37:51.560 --> 2:37:58.200]  department is it's just the body language of the mayor and these people was just ridiculous and i
[2:37:58.200 --> 2:38:03.560]  sat there and watched people for like 10 minutes how they would respond to them how they acted
[2:38:04.440 --> 2:38:10.040]  and i was just like man i know too much i mean do these people even know how they looked are they
[2:38:10.040 --> 2:38:19.560]  even aware of the psychology here oh i was embarrassed once i went out to mz's event was great two
[2:38:19.560 --> 2:38:25.800]  nights and it added an extra night as it sold out there in santa cruz ksco i was very honored it was
[2:38:25.800 --> 2:38:29.800]  one of the best speaking events i ever did but i was embarrassed when they had like let's not
[2:38:29.800 --> 2:38:37.240]  exaggerate 10 cops to escort me in and escort me out and they ended up the police told this radio
[2:38:37.240 --> 2:38:42.520]  station in the big boardwalk theater you he's not going to speak if we don't give him security
[2:38:43.400 --> 2:38:46.680]  and i guess i should have been honored because it turned out a bunch of the cops were listeners
[2:38:46.680 --> 2:38:51.240]  but it was kind of like i was enslaved by it i mean it was like they're like at the end they go
[2:38:51.240 --> 2:38:54.520]  jones we hear you don't like this but we had some intel that was someone dangerous here and
[2:38:55.800 --> 2:38:59.800]  that's why we were searching everyone and i kind of got mad at them but then the austin police
[2:38:59.800 --> 2:39:07.400]  department discovered somebody was here in town to kill me and was trying to stake me out they got
[2:39:07.400 --> 2:39:12.520]  word of it went and grabbed the guy had to release him he went and when the police came to talk to
[2:39:12.520 --> 2:39:17.240]  him in california he killed one cop shot up a bunch of other stuff and then he got shot by the police
[2:39:18.200 --> 2:39:23.000]  so i was like wow maybe the cops were right i mean that's what i mean maybe the mayor does
[2:39:23.000 --> 2:39:28.920]  need all this security maybe i'm wrong see i mean as you as you look at this things are not
[2:39:28.920 --> 2:39:36.360]  usually just one-sided abortion is one-sided that's why you got to look at not just the surface of it
[2:39:36.360 --> 2:39:41.960]  but what's behind it like all the security sounds great but why do we need all this security because
[2:39:41.960 --> 2:39:47.720]  we're becoming a very sick society or is it the perception of a sick society and we're not really
[2:39:47.720 --> 2:39:53.960]  i want to go to jan and gatekeeper and don and slim and rob that'll be it those five
[2:39:53.960 --> 2:39:57.800]  callers sorry the other colleges all i have time for today i want to hit the rest of this news but
[2:39:57.800 --> 2:40:05.320]  right now let's get back into the disappeared chicago police detain americans at abuse laden
[2:40:05.320 --> 2:40:11.640]  black site the chicago police department operates an op the books interrogation compound rendering
[2:40:11.640 --> 2:40:16.680]  americans unable to be found by family or attorneys while locked inside what lawyers say is a
[2:40:16.680 --> 2:40:21.560]  domestic equivalent of a cia black site well you think sets up these sites and sets up the
[2:40:21.560 --> 2:40:28.760]  threat fusion centers and believe me folks i know okay believe me i know exclusive secret
[2:40:28.760 --> 2:40:35.880]  interrogation facility reveals aspects of war on terror in us they disappeared us protesters
[2:40:35.880 --> 2:40:42.200]  detained 17 hour shackling without basic rights accounts describe police brutality missing 15
[2:40:42.200 --> 2:40:49.000]  year old and one man's death in the facility keeping arrest out of the official booking databases
[2:40:49.000 --> 2:40:53.960]  beatings by police resulting in head wounds shackling for prolonged periods denying attorneys
[2:40:53.960 --> 2:40:58.840]  access to secure facility holding people without legal counsel for 12 24 hours including people
[2:40:58.840 --> 2:41:03.400]  as young as 15 and look chicago's collapsed into a government cesspit of crime because they have no
[2:41:03.400 --> 2:41:09.320]  guns in many areas is nice areas of chicago's well with the south side there's no excuse for this
[2:41:09.320 --> 2:41:19.240]  but see a society collapses you'll see more of this and it goes into the torture of
[2:41:19.480 --> 2:41:24.760]  torture of protesters and disappearance the cia calls them black sites or they're really called
[2:41:24.760 --> 2:41:30.200]  ghost sites it's a domestic black site when you go in no one knows what's happening to you
[2:41:30.200 --> 2:41:37.640]  secretive warehouse yeah when rob do got arrested they settled a lawsuit with us by the way
[2:41:39.640 --> 2:41:41.720]  at the g20 was that 2009
[2:41:43.880 --> 2:41:49.560]  they took them all to a facility in the freezing rain at an army barracks and an army there army
[2:41:49.560 --> 2:41:54.760]  and then all these police they would keep not in the sleep for like five six hours and then they
[2:41:54.760 --> 2:41:59.640]  would say get up go to the bathroom and then they would sit there and make comments about people's
[2:41:59.640 --> 2:42:07.480]  genitals i mean can you imagine this folks and this is just the basic stuff that goes on and
[2:42:09.560 --> 2:42:13.640]  rob do was on a hilltop above the university the g20's over they said no assemblies
[2:42:14.200 --> 2:42:19.240]  during the day or at night everybody's out at the park eating food hanging out and there's video
[2:42:19.240 --> 2:42:24.040]  of like women on bicycles running away and cops hitting them in the back of the head with batons
[2:42:24.040 --> 2:42:28.840]  i tell you kill somebody because they fall off at their head and of course they lost a lawsuit
[2:42:28.840 --> 2:42:33.480]  they lost hundreds they don't care it's taxpayer money and i'm not here bashing the police
[2:42:33.480 --> 2:42:40.120]  is this the country you really want to live in with black sites and torture camps and
[2:42:42.120 --> 2:42:45.960]  rob do's up on the hill with like abc cbs you name it local news they won't think
[2:42:45.960 --> 2:42:51.560]  and rob do you know didn't have a big official you know uh flag on the microphone because we
[2:42:51.560 --> 2:42:56.520]  weren't doing interviews and they looked everybody's press passes and they go well where's your
[2:42:56.520 --> 2:42:59.800]  press passing goes up just first amendment you know he said nice all in video that's why he won the
[2:42:59.800 --> 2:43:08.120]  lawsuit and they were going to take you to jail so they take him to jail and they even keep the
[2:43:08.120 --> 2:43:12.600]  camera running while they talk crap to everybody and the cameras just sitting there for another 20
[2:43:12.600 --> 2:43:18.200]  minutes running all they put him in handcuffs and everything else okay your mainstream your mainstream

[2:43:42.600 --> 2:43:48.120]  before god believe me you don't think i've wanted to cheat to beat my enemies before you don't think
[2:43:48.120 --> 2:43:53.800]  i wanted to pull dirty tricks but i know you cannot use evil and have it turn to good it may work at
[2:43:53.800 --> 2:44:02.360]  first but down the road it it comes around and bites you in the booty the evil things i've done
[2:44:02.360 --> 2:44:09.080]  and they're pretty mild but things i did when i was younger all of it came back on me every stinking
[2:44:09.080 --> 2:44:18.120]  bed of it many times over let me tell you something too it comes back on your family and your friends
[2:44:18.280 --> 2:44:25.720]  i mean it's you don't believe in god or karma or rip yourself whatever it's a law that anybody
[2:44:25.720 --> 2:44:30.760]  who's been up and down the street anybody who's been around the block of life knows it's real and
[2:44:30.760 --> 2:44:41.400]  knows you mess with that galactic spiritual law at your own peril jan in virginia jan thank you
[2:44:41.400 --> 2:44:48.920]  for holding her on the air hey alex thanks for taking my call thank you um i was with you guys
[2:44:49.480 --> 2:44:53.880]  in shantilly um i don't even remember what year but a few years ago in bill de berg and
[2:44:53.880 --> 2:44:59.560]  i loved the daisy chain uh megaphones that was awesome with the windows rattling and everything
[2:44:59.560 --> 2:45:06.040]  that was great yeah the head of the cfr coming out looking like i wanted to kill us yeah that was
[2:45:06.040 --> 2:45:11.480]  that was fun but um but anyways i wanted to cover just a couple of points um as far as net
[2:45:11.480 --> 2:45:15.960]  neutrality i called my congressman and i urge everybody to do that because your call is it's
[2:45:15.960 --> 2:45:22.040]  not just one call it counts as many people calling since not that many people you know take the time
[2:45:22.040 --> 2:45:28.040]  to call so i urge everybody to give them a call let them know you know to stop the fc the fcc with
[2:45:28.040 --> 2:45:35.800]  this ridiculous bill that nobody can read and and everything else all right so my second point is um
[2:45:35.800 --> 2:45:43.320]  you touched on it with madsen um i've created a newsletter just to see what happened in my local
[2:45:43.320 --> 2:45:50.760]  town in virginia and i put like 30 or 40 copies and uh my in-laws barbech barbershop job people
[2:45:50.760 --> 2:45:57.400]  picked it up and um all it was was just quotes from you know past presidents eisenhower uh
[2:45:57.400 --> 2:46:03.160]  kennedy just warning about the military industrial complex complex and that's right if the tens of
[2:46:03.160 --> 2:46:08.680]  millions of awake patriots in the us alone would just hand out business cards with quotes and websites
[2:46:08.680 --> 2:46:13.720]  print out sheets whatever you come up with we we would defeat the globalist very quickly we could
[2:46:13.720 --> 2:46:21.240]  litter everything just obnoxiously dropping things off everywhere that's what i do people picked it up
[2:46:21.240 --> 2:46:26.200]  and uh we ended up meeting up at a friend's house and one of the guys that was there had picked up
[2:46:26.200 --> 2:46:30.200]  the newsletter and was like oh you guys wrote that that's cool you know and you know when's the next
[2:46:30.200 --> 2:46:33.800]  one coming out so we're like all right so i think the next one's going to be like a vaccines in
[2:46:33.800 --> 2:46:39.000]  agenda 21 or something like that but uh but also another thing i used to do was do you know print
[2:46:39.000 --> 2:46:46.440]  out like vaccine inserts print out vaccine information and go to cvs go to all the pharmacies
[2:46:46.440 --> 2:46:51.080]  and i used to like hide them you know kind of so they wouldn't see me but i would like put them out
[2:46:51.080 --> 2:46:55.480]  so people would pick them up or pass them out outside because you know that's where people are
[2:46:55.480 --> 2:47:02.760]  going to get injected so that was another direct action that i used to do um the last thing i wanted
[2:47:02.760 --> 2:47:09.400]  to talk about was uh as far as real estate i know everybody wants to you know like buy a house or
[2:47:09.400 --> 2:47:15.080]  live in a place that's uh that they can afford they don't have to go through a bank um what i
[2:47:15.080 --> 2:47:21.960]  ended up doing was i want i wanted to have some land i got uh owner financing i don't know if
[2:47:21.960 --> 2:47:26.360]  many people are familiar with that but that's where you your house is financed through a person
[2:47:26.360 --> 2:47:31.800]  and not through a bank and uh basically i i went through i actually went through a realtor this
[2:47:31.800 --> 2:47:36.920]  guy was selling this land and i was like hey will you you know own owner finance it for me i got a
[2:47:36.920 --> 2:47:41.240]  i had like ten thousand dollars because absolutely and if you don't pay it he can take it back that's
[2:47:41.240 --> 2:47:45.320]  one of the best ways to sell cars land there's a lot of owner financing out there and that's the
[2:47:45.320 --> 2:47:50.840]  way to go or support a local bank you know local banks are not our enemy it's the big globalist
[2:47:50.840 --> 2:47:56.520]  banks of the bad news exactly but um but they totally went for it and you know they're like
[2:47:56.520 --> 2:48:01.400]  okay cool you got ten thousand down you know we'll finance the other twenty thousand and this is i
[2:48:01.400 --> 2:48:07.720]  got 30 acres for thirty thousand dollars in central virginia like no virginia is so beautiful
[2:48:08.920 --> 2:48:15.080]  if you can't afford like you know uh you know 30 acres or whatever like just get a couple acres
[2:48:15.080 --> 2:48:20.040]  all right so there is this type of house that you can build it's like an underground house
[2:48:20.040 --> 2:48:25.960]  it's called a wafati yes and there's other kinds of that you can build and this guy out in the in
[2:48:25.960 --> 2:48:31.560]  the uk he only had two acres of land right and he built this house it was this underground house
[2:48:31.560 --> 2:48:36.520]  and the uh the tax collector people or whatever were like we we heard you have this house you
[2:48:36.520 --> 2:48:40.920]  we know you need taxes on it and you know this is illegal or whatever and he's like oh i don't
[2:48:40.920 --> 2:48:43.640]  know what you're talking about he's like you can go ahead and walk around on my property
[2:48:44.200 --> 2:48:48.040]  good luck you know finding what you're looking for but that's what the zoning is about they're
[2:48:48.040 --> 2:48:53.080]  going to cut the resources off to the point that you pay for a 200 square foot chamber
[2:48:53.080 --> 2:48:57.160]  what you pay for a large house and they know everybody's going to then try to go off the grid
[2:48:57.160 --> 2:49:02.120]  so that's what the new policing agencies are about the new zoning police worldwide is a shut
[2:49:02.120 --> 2:49:06.760]  that down you will not grow your own food you will not have a fire you will be under global on

[2:54:29.800 --> 2:54:38.280]  foot in the door we need to stop quote different media dividing country that's media matters and
[2:54:38.280 --> 2:54:44.680]  george soros is trying to shut this show down and the drudge report flashback in 98 she said
[2:54:44.680 --> 2:54:50.200]  internet news needs a rethink and they go on to say it's the chinese model for censoring the web
[2:54:50.840 --> 2:54:55.800]  in china they send out bureaucrats they sent them here a few months ago to meet with obama and
[2:54:55.800 --> 2:55:02.120]  zuckerberg to learn from them how to censor australia tried to adopt this a few years ago and that
[2:55:02.120 --> 2:55:09.000]  was the headline in the sydney art newspaper was australia to adopt chinese style censorship

[2:56:36.600 --> 2:56:40.840]  we got them and they're scared other people are figuring out the paradigm because here's
[2:56:40.840 --> 2:56:46.280]  the deal once people see stuff from our angle they learn it's not our angle we're actually
[2:56:46.280 --> 2:56:51.800]  looking at it from above from a globalist perspective but we're not globalist then you
[2:56:51.800 --> 2:56:56.840]  find out oh it's not a point of view it's that we're really outside the box we really get it
[2:56:56.840 --> 2:57:01.880]  now you can have different interpretations of what you see but once you get our mountaintop view
[2:57:01.880 --> 2:57:06.760]  here and you're not down you know looking at the ground one inch from the elephant's butt

[2:58:16.760 --> 2:58:21.560]  it feels like it's terrible but once you actually get in the cockpit once you get in a gun pod and
[2:58:21.560 --> 2:58:26.440]  start blasting enemy forces in the info war and watch them blow up and then watch them counter
[2:58:26.440 --> 2:58:32.520]  strike then you're in the war then you can't get out then you're addicted then you're free

[3:00:24.520 --> 3:00:31.640]  hailing from the former great set of georgia what what what femur region are you in uh i hadn't
[3:00:31.640 --> 3:00:36.280]  looked that up yet i'm sorry you can tell me i don't remember i think you might be in three or four
[3:00:36.280 --> 3:00:42.520]  but go ahead okay well i'm calling most of a testimonial which is a pretty good one because
[3:00:43.320 --> 3:00:49.800]  about uh 14 years ago i was uh diagnosed with the bipolar net manic depression and uh
[3:00:50.600 --> 3:00:59.000]  from the medication that i'm on it is uh caused a lot of problems um with uh you know regular
[3:00:59.000 --> 3:01:05.240]  you know using the bathroom and uh just uh basically need to nap every day and once i heard
[3:01:05.240 --> 3:01:13.080]  about super mill vitality and the other product i started buying them one by one and i mean it is
[3:01:13.080 --> 3:01:19.320]  just not only enough blessing is the word i mean it has just changed my life because it seems like
[3:01:19.320 --> 3:01:25.240]  every time after i eat lunch my body just wants to shut down i had to take a nap and you know that
[3:01:25.240 --> 3:01:31.640]  just you know messes up work and stuff like that since i started taking uh super mill vitality it has
[3:01:31.640 --> 3:01:39.240]  helped with that as well is i'm on about three medications that that bother me libido wise
[3:01:40.040 --> 3:01:47.000]  and i mean i ain't even i ain't got to get into it but i i have uh it has been a blessing me in
[3:01:47.000 --> 3:01:52.280]  ways well sir let me just throw this out at you we can't make medical claims because of the fda and
[3:01:52.280 --> 3:01:56.120]  the things they do that i believe violate the first amendment but here's the issue
[3:01:56.120 --> 3:02:04.200]  you we just show the one in telegraph with a major government study out monday the university of kent
[3:02:05.000 --> 3:02:09.320]  that fluoride in the water is causing depression thyroid problems everything else well
[3:02:09.960 --> 3:02:16.040]  so many times we have mineral or vitamin deficiencies the estrogen members have suppressed our glands
[3:02:16.040 --> 3:02:21.560]  and that's what we've come out with is things that i would want to take that i do take that
[3:02:21.560 --> 3:02:27.400]  have changed my life so that's all i'm going to say try the super male the super female you want to
[3:02:27.400 --> 3:02:37.240]  try the x2 have you tried x2 yet uh yes see the issue is i started taking x2 super male and uh
[3:02:38.040 --> 3:02:43.640]  fluoride shield at the same time so it's kind of hard for me to distinguish uh yeah so you think
[3:02:43.640 --> 3:02:48.040]  it's the super male doing it and that's certainly energy the glands all the rest of it it's just
[3:02:48.040 --> 3:02:53.560]  known concentrated cold pressed herbs and extracts that that are just you know i mean all the big
[3:02:53.560 --> 3:02:57.480]  big uh you know folks that are into this are buying it because they go man this is really high quality
[3:02:57.480 --> 3:03:01.800]  really concentrated i mean even for the snobs that are into herbs they're like whoa this is
[3:03:01.800 --> 3:03:06.440]  really well priced and really is smoking because we have the best known labs making it groups and
[3:03:06.440 --> 3:03:11.320]  several others but i'm telling you if you are having all these problems a lot of times it's
[3:03:11.320 --> 3:03:16.760]  associated with a thyroid you take out those bad halogens and add the good ones it's amazing and
[3:03:16.760 --> 3:03:23.480]  that's what the london telegraph is saying i mean here's national geographic nature's best remedies
[3:03:23.480 --> 3:03:29.960]  but see if i say that they'll come lock me in and throw me in you know handcuffs so there you go
[3:03:29.960 --> 3:03:36.600]  brother but overall you you think it was worth the money yeah and i'll tell you one more major
[3:03:36.600 --> 3:03:41.640]  major thing is you know i won't get too graphic but i only use the bathroom about once every three
[3:03:41.640 --> 3:03:48.600]  or four days well thanks to the oxypowder um i am now using it every day man and i mean that is just
[3:03:49.640 --> 3:03:54.280]  i've been like this for 14 years i mean it almost brings tears to my eyes man
[3:03:54.280 --> 3:03:58.200]  well brother i hear you yeah there are a lot of folks that go to the bathroom like once a week
[3:03:58.200 --> 3:04:01.480]  every three or four days the thing about oxypowder is let's say you're going to the bathroom every
[3:04:01.480 --> 3:04:05.320]  three days you take it some people now they're taking it going you know every day maybe you're

[3:04:16.200 --> 3:04:22.360]  then the the effects continued all right the way i did it originally is i did it the way uh
[3:04:23.000 --> 3:04:29.240]  set on the bottle but i had to actually get up to 10 capsules before it started working for me
