[00:00.000 --> 00:13.000]  Now listen up! The globalists are making their move, but we know their plan.
[00:13.000 --> 00:26.000]  But we can stop them. She'll get her way. America cannot be defeated as long as we get on our knees before God.
[00:26.000 --> 00:38.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are broadcasting worldwide on this Tuesday, March 31st, 2020.
[00:38.000 --> 00:47.000]  Global Transmission. I am your host, Alex Jones. We've got a wrath of incredible guests today, including Paul Joseph Watson,
[00:47.000 --> 00:56.000]  whose story is right up at the top of the Vaunted Drudge Report, like the Eye of Sauron.
[00:56.000 --> 01:07.000]  A giant red siren, like the Drudge Siren, is there, like the Eye of Sauron, to scare the public.
[01:07.000 --> 01:14.000]  And now we know the Democrats want to replace Cuomo, if Hillary can't do it, in as faltering Joe Biden prepares to collapse.
[01:14.000 --> 01:23.000]  That is one billion percent being done to create panic and total and complete hysteria.
[01:23.000 --> 01:29.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, that story is absolutely critical from summit.news.
[01:29.000 --> 01:37.000]  Also, there's another Drudge Report link to infowars.com and zero hedge, dealing with all over the country, boarding up for civil unrest.
[01:37.000 --> 01:46.000]  We have massive developments, cutting edge intel and scuttlebutt inside Fox News and the NRA about the Democrats' plans,
[01:46.000 --> 01:51.000]  if they can steal the election, to shudder the NRA and take over Fox News.
[01:51.000 --> 01:55.000]  But first, Governor Cuomo with egg on his filthy face.
[01:55.000 --> 02:03.000]  Were there ventilators found in a storage facility or something that the president is claiming that there were ventilators found,
[02:03.000 --> 02:06.000]  that they need to be distributed? Is there any truth to that?
[02:06.000 --> 02:13.000]  That is incorrect, grossly uninformed.
[02:13.000 --> 02:21.000]  The point is, we have ventilators in a stockpile and we need to send them to the hospitals.
[02:21.000 --> 02:26.000]  Of course we didn't. That's the whole point. The hospitals don't need them yet.
[02:26.000 --> 02:31.000]  The hospitals aren't at their apex. The hospitals have enough ventilators today.
[02:31.000 --> 02:37.000]  We're planning for an apex, a high point, in about 21 days.
[02:37.000 --> 02:40.000]  That's when we need the 30,000 ventilators.
[02:40.000 --> 02:43.000]  Right now, we're putting them in a stockpile.
[02:43.000 --> 02:47.000]  So the point is, whether in a stockpile, you must not need them.
[02:47.000 --> 02:51.000]  It's just ignorant. Of course you don't need them today.
[02:51.000 --> 02:57.000]  When you hit the climax of the apex, which is 30,000.
[02:57.000 --> 03:00.000]  Where are the ventilators? Where are the gowns?
[03:00.000 --> 03:04.000]  Where are the PPEs? Where are the masks? Where are they?
[03:04.000 --> 03:08.000]  It is a war. With an act like it's a war.
[03:08.000 --> 03:14.000]  And at the rate they are going, it is not happening.
[03:14.000 --> 03:18.000]  FEMA says we're sending 400 ventilators.
[03:18.000 --> 03:23.000]  Really? What am I going to do with 400 ventilators?
[03:23.000 --> 03:29.000]  When I need 30,000, you pick the 26,000 people who are going to die
[03:29.000 --> 03:33.000]  because you only sent 400 ventilators.
[03:33.000 --> 03:39.000]  We have ventilators in a stockpile and we didn't send them to the hospitals yet.
[03:39.000 --> 03:41.000]  Of course we didn't. That's the whole point.
[03:41.000 --> 03:45.000]  The hospitals don't need them yet. The hospitals aren't at their apex.
[03:45.000 --> 03:48.000]  The hospitals have enough ventilators today.
[03:48.000 --> 03:52.000]  We're planning for an apex, a high point, in about 21 days.
[03:52.000 --> 03:56.000]  That's when we need the 30,000 ventilators. Not today.
[03:56.000 --> 03:59.000]  Right now we're putting them in a stockpile.
[03:59.000 --> 04:02.000]  What am I going to do with 400 ventilators?
[04:02.000 --> 04:09.000]  When I need 30,000, when I need 30,000, when I need 30,000.
[04:09.000 --> 04:11.000]  Because you don't need them today.
[04:11.000 --> 04:17.000]  You need them when you pick the client of the apex, which is 30,000.
[04:17.000 --> 04:19.000]  We're not there yet.
[04:19.000 --> 04:22.000]  You pick the 26,000 people who are going to die.
[04:22.000 --> 04:28.000]  Of course you don't need them today. You need them when you pick the client of the apex,
[04:28.000 --> 04:31.000]  which is 30,000. We're not there yet.
[04:31.000 --> 04:36.000]  We have ventilators in a stockpile and we didn't send them to the hospitals yet.
[04:36.000 --> 04:39.000]  Of course we didn't. That's the whole point.
[04:39.000 --> 04:40.000]  The hospitals don't...
[04:40.000 --> 04:43.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are broadcasting worldwide.
[04:43.000 --> 04:49.000]  We are live in defiance of the loveless censors, in defiance of the chai-koms and mill gates.
[04:49.000 --> 04:57.000]  And info wars is stronger than ever. Thanks to you and your word of mouth that is unstoppable.
[05:19.000 --> 05:24.000]  Info wars have been sounding the alarm for patriots worldwide.
[05:24.000 --> 05:30.000]  Waking people up to the new world order. Bohemian Grove.
[05:30.000 --> 05:35.000]  The American deep state. The rise of communist China.
[05:35.000 --> 05:38.000]  The plan for global depopulation.
[05:38.000 --> 05:43.000]  And global elite pedophiles who prey off of our young.
[05:43.000 --> 05:49.000]  The enemy has done their best to destroy us, but because of your support, our fight continues.
[05:49.000 --> 05:55.000]  Join us, support the info war, and together we will slay the dragon.
[05:55.000 --> 06:16.000]  Keep fighting Alex, you're the gladiator.
[06:16.000 --> 06:21.000]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[06:21.000 --> 06:31.000]  Live from the info wars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[06:31.000 --> 06:48.000]  In 2006, there was a big movie that came out.
[06:48.000 --> 06:54.000]  Titled V for Vendetta.
[06:54.000 --> 07:08.000]  And in that movie, it's set in a dystopic future in the United Kingdom where a British Chancellor has become dictator
[07:08.000 --> 07:20.000]  by releasing a bio weapon from the government stockpile, tested on human subjects secretly to then create a martial law clampdown,
[07:20.000 --> 07:26.000]  and then they had a vaccine to then be the savior of the population.
[07:26.000 --> 07:32.000]  Now, a lot of folks are making parallels to that today.
[07:32.000 --> 07:45.000]  But it was in 1993 that the incredibly prescient Simpsons
[07:45.000 --> 07:53.000]  released an episode where corporations running the governments, not governments,
[07:53.000 --> 08:02.000]  release a bio weapon to take control of the population.
[08:02.000 --> 08:11.000]  And when you listen to what they say, it's exactly word for word, the formula of the fair mongering they're now engaged in right now.
[08:11.000 --> 08:13.000]  Now, you ask, how do they do that?
[08:13.000 --> 08:16.000]  I'm going to play the clip in a moment.
[08:16.000 --> 08:30.000]  Chris Carter, a year before 9-11, he gave interviews to major publications,
[08:30.000 --> 08:39.000]  and by the way, I've talked to Chris Carter and conferred back and forth, I'm just going to leave it at that, years later,
[08:39.000 --> 08:48.000]  that he was approached by the Central Intelligence Agency with a plot for the X file spinoff, the lone gunman,
[08:48.000 --> 08:51.000]  that then aired six months before 9-11.
[08:51.000 --> 08:57.000]  He was approached one year before with a script of a criminal group in the government hijacking a jet
[08:57.000 --> 09:02.000]  by remote control, the flight of the World Trade Center,
[09:02.000 --> 09:12.000]  but that it would be blamed on Afghanistan and there would be an invasion of Afghanistan.
[09:12.000 --> 09:17.000]  Now, Carter doesn't know why the CIA gave him that idea and told him it'd be a good plot.
[09:17.000 --> 09:22.000]  He did it, but he's got a good idea now.
[09:22.000 --> 09:26.000]  So when you ask, how does the Simpsons have this?
[09:26.000 --> 09:32.000]  I talked years ago in Los Angeles more than 15 years ago to some of the writers,
[09:32.000 --> 09:36.000]  happened to run into them in a party, and they said,
[09:36.000 --> 09:42.000]  we're not sure why the government approaches us from time to time with plot lines and things they want.
[09:42.000 --> 09:46.000]  We don't know if they're warning us of something bad that another group wants to do,
[09:46.000 --> 09:52.000]  or if it's predictive programming, but you're dead on.
[09:52.000 --> 10:01.000]  Some of the same people told me that the rich folks in Hollywood were all leaving for
[10:01.000 --> 10:06.000]  other parts of the world like New Zealand.
[10:06.000 --> 10:11.000]  So it's even been in the Wall Street Journal of the New York Times 13, 14 years ago
[10:11.000 --> 10:17.000]  that Jeffrey Epstein ran a eugenics operation to depopulate the earth for Billa Melinda Gates,
[10:17.000 --> 10:21.000]  Ted Turner, Warren Buffett,
[10:21.000 --> 10:28.000]  and of course Oprah Winfrey, Prince Charles is a part of the group as well.
[10:28.000 --> 10:31.000]  So you cannot make any of this up.
[10:31.000 --> 10:33.000]  If you're a radio listener and you're on this, sounds fantastical.
[10:33.000 --> 10:38.000]  They're actually putting on screen while I talk the actual Wall Street Journal article about it.
[10:38.000 --> 10:43.000]  World government, and they say out of a bio weapon attack,
[10:43.000 --> 10:49.000]  we will accept vaccines that then have sterilants in them or cause sterilization.
[10:49.000 --> 10:52.000]  What is COVID-19 doing, eating the testicles?
[10:52.000 --> 10:53.000]  That's how they describe it.
[10:53.000 --> 10:57.000]  They said lacerating it, destroying it, causing most men to be completely infertile
[10:57.000 --> 11:02.000]  and reducing others' fertility.
[11:02.000 --> 11:11.000]  So here is the 1993.
[11:11.000 --> 11:17.000]  Simpsons, with the newscasters wearing bio hazard suits on TV to scare you,
[11:17.000 --> 11:23.000]  exactly what you see happening now with New York, with a giant red spinning siren
[11:23.000 --> 11:27.000]  to scare everyone into submission to stay in their homes,
[11:27.000 --> 11:31.000]  and every media group exacerbating the fear as much as they can.
[11:31.000 --> 11:34.000]  Find that article at dredgerport.com, right?
[11:34.000 --> 11:39.000]  Dead center in the middle of the page.
[11:39.000 --> 11:44.000]  The eye of Sauron is upon you.
[11:44.000 --> 11:48.000]  You know of what I speak enough.
[11:48.000 --> 11:53.000]  An eye lid-less, wreathed in frame.
[11:53.000 --> 11:56.000]  The eye sees all.
[11:56.000 --> 12:04.000]  It pierces air, stone and flesh.
[12:04.000 --> 12:12.000]  But let's now go to the predictive programming.
[12:12.000 --> 12:15.000]  So your subconscious mind sees it and accepts it,
[12:15.000 --> 12:19.000]  and then later doesn't remember it, but your subconscious does,
[12:19.000 --> 12:25.000]  and then you accept the fear when you're seeing it and accept that it's right
[12:25.000 --> 12:28.000]  because your mind is already familiar with it.
[12:28.000 --> 12:32.000]  Make a friend of death, you will one day meet it.
[12:32.000 --> 12:36.000]  Here it is.
[12:36.000 --> 12:40.000]  I'd like to call to order this secret conclave of America's media empires.
[12:40.000 --> 12:43.000]  We're here to come up with the next phony baloney crisis
[12:43.000 --> 12:45.000]  to put Americans back where they belong,
[12:45.000 --> 12:47.000]  and dark rooms glued to their televisions
[12:47.000 --> 12:49.000]  too terrified to skip the commercials.
[12:49.000 --> 12:50.000]  Well, I think...
[12:50.000 --> 12:53.000]  NBC, you are here to listen and not speak.
[12:53.000 --> 12:56.000]  I think we should go with a good old-fashioned public health care.
[12:56.000 --> 12:57.000]  Yeah.
[12:57.000 --> 12:59.000]  A new disease. No one's immune.
[12:59.000 --> 13:02.000]  It's like the summer of the shark, except instead of a shark,
[13:02.000 --> 13:05.000]  it's an epidemic, and instead of summer, it's all the time.
[13:05.000 --> 13:09.000]  Now, I hate to be the guy who derails what everybody else loves.
[13:09.000 --> 13:11.000]  He loves being that guy.
[13:11.000 --> 13:13.000]  But, Janice, we do have standards.
[13:13.000 --> 13:15.000]  This can't be a made-up disease.
[13:15.000 --> 13:20.000]  The only moral thing to do is release a deadly virus into the general public.
[13:20.000 --> 13:23.000]  We do have something we've been holding on to, but it hasn't been tested.
[13:23.000 --> 13:25.000]  Get over here, NBC.
[13:27.000 --> 13:30.000]  We certainly believe in testing, but I...
[13:33.000 --> 13:34.000]  Wow. Wow.
[13:34.000 --> 13:35.000]  Oh, yeah!
[13:35.000 --> 13:37.000]  So, we've got our deadly disease.
[13:37.000 --> 13:41.000]  Now, we just have to blame it on something that's in every household,
[13:41.000 --> 13:44.000]  something that people are a little bit afraid of already.
[13:44.000 --> 13:47.000]  House cat flu is coming, people.
[13:47.000 --> 13:50.000]  The Center for Disease Disinformation predicts with some degree of probability
[13:50.000 --> 13:55.000]  that the house cat flu might spread in the following hypothetical outbreak pattern.
[13:55.000 --> 14:06.000]  So, better beware that warm body on your lap just might be ready to destroy your tender vitals.
[14:08.000 --> 14:11.000]  Springfielders are advised to stay tuned for more information
[14:11.000 --> 14:13.000]  if they experience any of the following symptoms.
[14:13.000 --> 14:17.000]  Mild thirst, occasional hunger, tiredness at night...
[14:17.000 --> 14:21.000]  So, ladies and gentlemen, 1993.
[14:21.000 --> 14:26.000]  Now, what's really going on now?
[14:26.000 --> 14:31.000]  You're seeing the maximum fear be pushed.
[14:31.000 --> 14:35.000]  And you notice, first, it's, oh, just bars and restaurants are closed.
[14:35.000 --> 14:37.000]  Oh, then movie theaters, then bowling alleys, then...
[14:37.000 --> 14:39.000]  Well, you can go to the park, but stay six feet apart.
[14:39.000 --> 14:42.000]  Oh, now, now it's eight meters.
[14:42.000 --> 14:44.000]  It was five meters, now it's eight meters.
[14:44.000 --> 14:53.000]  So, now you're supposed to stay 20 feet away from people, 30 feet away from people.
[14:53.000 --> 14:56.000]  Eight meters, folks.
[14:56.000 --> 15:00.000]  Five meters is a long, long way.
[15:00.000 --> 15:04.000]  What is five meters?
[15:04.000 --> 15:06.000]  That's basically 15 feet.
[15:06.000 --> 15:08.000]  That's 20, 22 feet, 23 feet.
[15:08.000 --> 15:10.000]  I mean, do the math yourself.
[15:10.000 --> 15:12.000]  It's all just conditioning you.
[15:12.000 --> 15:15.000]  And now it's, yeah, don't leave your house at all.
[15:15.000 --> 15:17.000]  So, they're just always expanding and expanding.
[15:17.000 --> 15:18.000]  It's an exact formula.
[15:18.000 --> 15:19.000]  It starts in China.
[15:19.000 --> 15:20.000]  Hell, we got the drones.
[15:20.000 --> 15:21.000]  We got it all.
[15:21.000 --> 15:26.000]  Maybe it'll move to welding people into their homes.
[15:26.000 --> 15:29.000]  Maybe it'll move to shooting women at checkpoints.
[15:29.000 --> 15:32.000]  Hell has already been some folks shot at checkpoints.
[15:32.000 --> 15:35.000]  But the same Democrats always wanted those borders wide open
[15:35.000 --> 15:39.000]  and told Trump, don't you dare block Chinese flying in four or five weeks ago.
[15:39.000 --> 15:41.000]  And just four and a half weeks ago,
[15:41.000 --> 15:45.000]  Pelosi was still saying, go out, go to Chinatown, go in public, hug Chinese.
[15:45.000 --> 15:48.000]  They needed to get it to incubate first to rate the fear.
[15:48.000 --> 15:51.000]  But really all it is is a very strong form of a cold virus.
[15:51.000 --> 15:53.000]  That's what corona is.
[15:53.000 --> 15:54.000]  It's just a common flu.
[15:54.000 --> 16:23.000]  And it kills a lot of folks every year.
[16:24.000 --> 16:25.000]  And not just one,
[16:25.000 --> 16:28.000]  but all your devices with one out of the box setup.
[16:28.000 --> 16:32.000]  Plus flash routers also enhances your wireless network performance
[16:32.000 --> 16:34.000]  and unlocks powerful router management tools
[16:34.000 --> 16:37.000]  to let you take total control of your network.

[16:52.000 --> 16:57.000]  Protect your wireless home network today with flash routers.
[17:22.000 --> 17:25.000]  You need to call the National Treatment Advisors.

[17:52.000 --> 17:57.000]  That's 800-506-6740.
[17:59.000 --> 18:01.000]  There is a paradox.
[18:01.000 --> 18:05.000]  Yes, this virus is deadly and does kill people.
[18:05.000 --> 18:07.000]  And so do many other countless viruses
[18:07.000 --> 18:11.000]  that have already existed that do exist and will exist.
[18:11.000 --> 18:15.000]  But when Trump says the cure is worse than disease,
[18:15.000 --> 18:19.000]  he's talking about the media hype creating hysteria
[18:19.000 --> 18:22.000]  and trying to create uncertainty.
[18:22.000 --> 18:25.000]  And it is that that I oppose.
[18:25.000 --> 18:29.000]  It is not the American way to cower and live in fear
[18:29.000 --> 18:32.000]  and to follow the edicts and precedents
[18:32.000 --> 18:37.000]  set by Communist China and hyper-authoritarian Singapore,
[18:37.000 --> 18:40.000]  where you're now being given six months in jail
[18:40.000 --> 18:44.000]  if you don't stand at least six feet away from someone.
[18:44.000 --> 18:47.000]  This is being used by social engineers
[18:47.000 --> 18:51.000]  and they admit that they are trying to transform our world forever
[18:51.000 --> 18:55.000]  into something unrecognizable from what it's been.
[18:55.000 --> 18:58.000]  We are not slaves and we must not act like it.
[18:58.000 --> 19:01.000]  One of our best-selling products is living defense
[19:01.000 --> 19:03.000]  and it's been sold out for over four months
[19:03.000 --> 19:06.000]  because it's hard to source the ingredients that are organic.
[19:06.000 --> 19:09.000]  We've got a limited supply right now, but it's selling out fast.
[19:09.000 --> 19:11.000]  And I want those of you that haven't experienced living defense
[19:11.000 --> 19:12.000]  to get it for yourself.
[19:12.000 --> 19:14.000]  Here's just part of one testimonial.
[19:14.000 --> 19:17.000]  I looked. In January 2016, I went in the hospital.
[19:17.000 --> 19:19.000]  I went to VA hospital out here in Boystein.
[19:19.000 --> 19:20.000]  I was in there until June.
[19:20.000 --> 19:23.000]  And one of the only things that got me through that ordeal
[19:23.000 --> 19:26.000]  was listening to info wars three hours a day
[19:26.000 --> 19:29.000]  and I kept hearing Dr. Group and all you guys talking about
[19:29.000 --> 19:31.000]  living defense. Let me tell you something, man.
[19:31.000 --> 19:33.000]  I had an internal digestive problem
[19:33.000 --> 19:35.000]  and I stumbled with it for about five or six years
[19:35.000 --> 19:37.000]  and the doctors, they tried every test.
[19:37.000 --> 19:39.000]  Nobody could figure out what it is.
[19:39.000 --> 19:41.000]  And then every day when I kept hearing you and Dr. Group
[19:41.000 --> 19:43.000]  and those commercials, I said, you know what?
[19:43.000 --> 19:45.000]  I'm going to get me some of that freaking living defense.
[19:45.000 --> 19:47.000]  Now, I wasn't supposed to have any nutritionals
[19:47.000 --> 19:48.000]  because they don't want you to have a stuff.
[19:48.000 --> 19:50.000]  But I ordered it, it shipped to me.
[19:50.000 --> 19:52.000]  I got it, I hid it from the nurses.
[19:52.000 --> 19:53.000]  I started taking it, man.
[19:53.000 --> 19:55.000]  That stuff changed my life.
[19:55.000 --> 19:56.000]  It saved my life.
[19:56.000 --> 20:09.000]  Alex Jones and info wars saved my life.
[20:26.000 --> 20:37.000]  We are on the prowl tonight.
[20:37.000 --> 20:41.000]  Today broadcasting worldwide in defense of liberty.
[20:41.000 --> 20:44.000]  We are live, live wire.
[20:44.000 --> 20:47.000]  Transmitting on a planetary scale.
[20:47.000 --> 20:51.000]  infowars.com, newswars.com.
[20:51.000 --> 20:54.000]  Another great site we support like summit.news.
[20:54.000 --> 20:57.000]  We are growing stronger in the face of tyranny.
[20:57.000 --> 21:01.000]  Not weaker, not submitted, but overcoming
[21:01.000 --> 21:06.000]  with the good grace of God.
[21:06.000 --> 21:07.000]  All right, ladies and gentlemen,
[21:07.000 --> 21:12.000]  let me lay out some of what's coming up today.
[21:12.000 --> 21:14.000]  Let me break it down.
[21:14.000 --> 21:17.000]  If you ask how could the Simpsons and how could V for Vendetta
[21:17.000 --> 21:20.000]  and how could all these Hollywood TV shows and movies
[21:20.000 --> 21:24.000]  predict exactly what's going on?
[21:24.000 --> 21:28.000]  How do they do it over and over again?
[21:28.000 --> 21:33.000]  Well, they're able to do it
[21:33.000 --> 21:37.000]  because this is what the Rockefeller Foundation
[21:37.000 --> 21:39.000]  and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation
[21:39.000 --> 21:44.000]  in major public studies by the club of Rome in the 60s
[21:44.000 --> 21:51.000]  and in the 1980s and 1990s,
[21:51.000 --> 21:54.000]  plans like State Department memorandum 200,
[21:54.000 --> 21:56.000]  don't read it.
[21:56.000 --> 21:58.000]  And then the secret biological and chemical
[21:58.000 --> 22:00.000]  and radiological testing on Americans,
[22:00.000 --> 22:05.000]  black, white, old, young, Native American, Hispanic, Asians,
[22:05.000 --> 22:08.000]  all over the world by these scientific cults,
[22:08.000 --> 22:10.000]  not the full government,
[22:10.000 --> 22:13.000]  these compartmentalized mad scientist groups
[22:13.000 --> 22:17.000]  that have had projects bigger than Manhattan Project
[22:17.000 --> 22:21.000]  engaged in lethal testing on the population treating us
[22:21.000 --> 22:30.000]  like guinea pigs, secret, illegal testing
[22:30.000 --> 22:36.000]  and then admitting it to you in your face
[22:36.000 --> 22:39.000]  what they are indeed doing in operations
[22:39.000 --> 22:41.000]  like lockstep by the Rockefeller Foundation,
[22:41.000 --> 22:43.000]  published in 2010,
[22:43.000 --> 22:47.000]  about how a bio-release of something like a flu
[22:47.000 --> 22:51.000]  or corona or other virus will be used
[22:51.000 --> 22:57.000]  for a planetary dictatorship.
[22:57.000 --> 22:59.000]  And now you see it.
[22:59.000 --> 23:01.000]  And this is something that does kill people.
[23:01.000 --> 23:04.000]  It's a souped-up common gold, man-made, engineered,
[23:04.000 --> 23:07.000]  does reoccur, does have HIV delivery system.
[23:07.000 --> 23:09.000]  Again, doesn't give you.
[23:09.000 --> 23:14.000]  HIV has the HIV delivery system cut off of HIV and put on it.
[23:14.000 --> 23:19.000]  It's airborne, it's nasty.
[23:19.000 --> 23:24.000]  So it's extremely important that everyone understand
[23:24.000 --> 23:27.000]  this is not a game, this is not a joke,
[23:27.000 --> 23:29.000]  and they're just throwing it in your face
[23:29.000 --> 23:33.000]  because the writers of these shows are told
[23:33.000 --> 23:37.000]  to throw it in everyone's face
[23:37.000 --> 23:40.000]  and they don't even know why
[23:40.000 --> 23:47.000]  and they end up contacting me
[23:47.000 --> 23:50.000]  to ask, what do you think is happening?
[23:50.000 --> 23:53.000]  I can't tell you the high-level research scientists
[23:53.000 --> 23:57.000]  that I've gone on, you know, camp-outs on their ranches
[23:57.000 --> 24:00.000]  and, you know, flowing on people's private jets
[24:00.000 --> 24:04.000]  and helicopters to their redoubts over a decade ago.
[24:04.000 --> 24:07.000]  These were liberals, these were leftists that woke up
[24:07.000 --> 24:09.000]  and saw what was happening and who would ask me,
[24:09.000 --> 24:11.000]  well, what should happen, what should we do?
[24:11.000 --> 24:14.000]  Because they were being told any time
[24:14.000 --> 24:17.000]  that Bush or Obama was going to release the bio-weapons
[24:17.000 --> 24:20.000]  and they knew about this and were led in on this
[24:20.000 --> 24:23.000]  and they were quitting their jobs, many of them had patents,
[24:23.000 --> 24:26.000]  many of them had made $10 million, $100 million, $200 million.
[24:26.000 --> 24:28.000]  All these research scientists are very wealthy,
[24:28.000 --> 24:30.000]  but they're not psychotics.
[24:30.000 --> 24:33.000]  And they were anti-human and pro-depopulation
[24:33.000 --> 24:35.000]  and in college and thought it was all cute.
[24:35.000 --> 24:40.000]  Then suddenly, they're in boardrooms with serious hombres,
[24:40.000 --> 24:44.000]  having the open discussions about how to roll out
[24:44.000 --> 24:48.000]  a low-level plague that is a drill, everybody locked down.
[24:48.000 --> 24:52.000]  Then if we behave in a lockdown past the test,
[24:52.000 --> 24:55.000]  then they release a stronger bio-weapon
[24:55.000 --> 24:58.000]  that kills a couple hundred million, not a couple million.
[24:58.000 --> 25:02.000]  And then if we behave under that and the lockdown is successful,
[25:02.000 --> 25:06.000]  then, ladies and gentlemen,
[25:06.000 --> 25:12.000]  they are able to release the super-weapon that kills billions.
[25:12.000 --> 25:15.000]  And the governments and the drones and the AIs
[25:15.000 --> 25:18.000]  able to lock it down, control the spread, where it's at,
[25:18.000 --> 25:21.000]  poses the savior the whole time they're directing it.
[25:21.000 --> 25:26.000]  And then, in the final equation,
[25:26.000 --> 25:31.000]  everyone is in bubble cities run by Apple, Google, Twitter,
[25:31.000 --> 25:34.000]  Amazon, and a few other major combines
[25:34.000 --> 25:38.000]  that are all 5, 6, 7G, forced inoculations,
[25:38.000 --> 25:41.000]  robot control, bioscans to get in,
[25:41.000 --> 25:43.000]  total complete domination,
[25:43.000 --> 25:45.000]  and within those martial law city-states,
[25:45.000 --> 25:48.000]  all of the establishment worker bees will be.
[25:48.000 --> 25:52.000]  The actual establishment will be in armored fortresses
[25:52.000 --> 25:55.000]  in Northern Canada, in Kauai, Hawaii,
[25:55.000 --> 26:00.000]  where another Cheyenne Mountain norad-type facility is.
[26:00.000 --> 26:03.000]  They're really the most important one.
[26:03.000 --> 26:10.000]  And in Tasmania, in Australia, and in New Zealand.
[26:10.000 --> 26:12.000]  But they got a bunch of them in Northern Canada,
[26:12.000 --> 26:14.000]  just so you know they're secret.
[26:14.000 --> 26:16.000]  I'm blowing their operations here for you,
[26:16.000 --> 26:18.000]  because they need to be exposed.
[26:18.000 --> 26:21.000]  So you need to understand that as soon as the robots are in place,
[26:21.000 --> 26:22.000]  and this is the rollout,
[26:22.000 --> 26:24.000]  that will follow the orders indiscriminately
[26:24.000 --> 26:27.000]  and autonomously control you,
[26:27.000 --> 26:29.000]  when they've got an airborne Ebola
[26:29.000 --> 26:31.000]  that they're planning to release that kills 90-plus percent,
[26:31.000 --> 26:33.000]  and they'll be the one spraying it,
[26:33.000 --> 26:35.000]  the shadow government will.
[26:35.000 --> 26:38.000]  The public is going to see hundreds of millions down in Africa,
[26:38.000 --> 26:40.000]  hundreds of millions down in other areas,
[26:40.000 --> 26:41.000]  and they're going to say,
[26:41.000 --> 26:44.000]  I want people killed that don't have the embedded chip
[26:44.000 --> 26:46.000]  that tracks whether they have it or not,
[26:46.000 --> 26:48.000]  the gates that come out with, the biochip,
[26:48.000 --> 26:52.000]  that's actually sewn into your cells at nanotech level.
[26:52.000 --> 26:54.000]  And then people will say,
[26:54.000 --> 26:56.000]  kill everyone that tries to leave their house,
[26:56.000 --> 26:58.000]  kill everyone that doesn't do what we say,
[26:58.000 --> 27:00.000]  and then they'll stop that mass plague,
[27:00.000 --> 27:01.000]  probably an airborne Ebola.
[27:01.000 --> 27:04.000]  That's what they fetishize and talk about most.
[27:04.000 --> 27:06.000]  And psychos like to tell you what they're going to do.
[27:06.000 --> 27:09.000]  Then that'll kill 100 million, 300 million,
[27:09.000 --> 27:11.000]  maybe half a billion.
[27:11.000 --> 27:13.000]  And then they'll all give you vaccines
[27:13.000 --> 27:16.000]  that soft kill you, sterilize you, dump you down
[27:16.000 --> 27:18.000]  to soften you up.
[27:18.000 --> 27:19.000]  You'll live in the bubble cities
[27:19.000 --> 27:21.000]  where they can slowly poison you and test on you.
[27:21.000 --> 27:23.000]  They will be in, again, underground bases
[27:23.000 --> 27:24.000]  and armored redoubts,
[27:24.000 --> 27:27.000]  that then will have elevators up to mountain plateaus
[27:27.000 --> 27:30.000]  in areas and their own fitness centers
[27:30.000 --> 27:32.000]  and their own little towns they'll fly in
[27:32.000 --> 27:33.000]  whoever they want.
[27:33.000 --> 27:36.000]  And that will be the new golden fields of Elysium
[27:36.000 --> 27:39.000]  or Moonraker, not in orbit,
[27:39.000 --> 27:44.000]  but in their own secret bubble cities.
[27:44.000 --> 27:46.000]  So you'll have the supposed bubble cities
[27:46.000 --> 27:49.000]  everybody wants to pay whose Nuvo reach to get into
[27:49.000 --> 27:50.000]  so they can control the middle class
[27:50.000 --> 27:52.000]  and the Nuvo reach their real enemy.
[27:52.000 --> 27:54.000]  It will be the last to be killed.
[27:54.000 --> 27:55.000]  They'll exterminate the third world,
[27:55.000 --> 27:57.000]  wipe them out.
[27:57.000 --> 27:58.000]  You'll all run to the bubble cities.
[27:58.000 --> 28:00.000]  I told you this 20 years ago.
[28:00.000 --> 28:02.000]  I have foreseen it from all my research.
[28:02.000 --> 28:03.000]  Now it's all confirmed.
[28:03.000 --> 28:05.000]  They officially are building the bubble cities right now.
[28:05.000 --> 28:06.000]  Toronto, Denver's building them.
[28:06.000 --> 28:08.000]  Austin's building a bubble city
[28:08.000 --> 28:10.000]  out at the old airport.
[28:10.000 --> 28:12.000]  And you opt into it at first.
[28:12.000 --> 28:13.000]  And then you'll be in the bubble city,
[28:13.000 --> 28:16.000]  but you'll think you've reached the plateau
[28:16.000 --> 28:20.000]  or the peak, the apex, the paramount point.
[28:20.000 --> 28:22.000]  But you'll be at the penultimate level,
[28:22.000 --> 28:25.000]  the actual final kill grid
[28:25.000 --> 28:26.000]  so that when they finally get you
[28:26.000 --> 28:28.000]  and finally have all the robot sentries in place,
[28:28.000 --> 28:31.000]  then they'll nerve gas everyone.
[28:31.000 --> 28:32.000]  And I think lastly,
[28:32.000 --> 28:33.000]  they'll use a chemical or something.
[28:33.000 --> 28:35.000]  They'll nerve gas you.
[28:35.000 --> 28:37.000]  You're so afraid of bio weapons.
[28:37.000 --> 28:39.000]  Then they'll nerve gas the bubble
[28:39.000 --> 28:42.000]  and the planet has been cleansed of you.
[28:42.000 --> 28:43.000]  I could have joined them,
[28:43.000 --> 28:45.000]  but I want to go to heaven.
[28:45.000 --> 28:47.000]  I want my spirit to go to the next level
[28:47.000 --> 28:48.000]  with the big dude.
[28:48.000 --> 28:50.000]  I want to join Satan in his operation,
[28:50.000 --> 28:52.000]  but it's been revealed to you
[28:52.000 --> 28:53.000]  for over 20 years there on air.
[28:53.000 --> 28:55.000]  And now you see exactly as I said, it's been unfolded.
[28:55.000 --> 28:56.000]  You might want to go back
[28:56.000 --> 28:58.000]  and find the old shows that freaked him out so bad.
[28:58.000 --> 28:59.000]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[28:59.000 --> 29:01.000]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago
[29:01.000 --> 29:03.000]  when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[29:03.000 --> 29:04.000]  I sued the IRS in one.
[29:04.000 --> 29:06.000]  I beat the IRS then,
[29:06.000 --> 29:07.000]  and I've been beating them ever since.
[29:07.000 --> 29:09.000]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement,
[29:09.000 --> 29:11.000]  and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems
[29:11.000 --> 29:13.000]  they thought might never be solved.
[29:13.000 --> 29:14.000]  I can help you too.
[29:14.000 --> 29:16.000]  If you owe taxes, you can't pay.
[29:16.000 --> 29:17.000]  Don't wait another day.
[29:17.000 --> 29:19.000]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[29:19.000 --> 29:21.000]  Call 834 no tax,
[29:21.000 --> 29:22.000]  or go to my website,
[29:22.000 --> 29:23.000]  danpilla.com.
[29:23.000 --> 29:27.000]  That's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[29:27.000 --> 29:29.000]  The United States of Empire
[29:29.000 --> 29:31.000]  is a book that claims the United States
[29:31.000 --> 29:33.000]  is the empire of the world.
[29:33.000 --> 29:36.000]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[29:36.000 --> 29:38.000]  The United States of Empire
[29:38.000 --> 29:42.000]  shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[29:42.000 --> 29:44.000]  Its former colony, the U.S.,
[29:44.000 --> 29:46.000]  had to save the empire.
[29:46.000 --> 29:47.000]  Was there ever a vote?
[29:47.000 --> 29:49.000]  Who do we fight for?
[29:49.000 --> 29:52.000]  The Deep State began with World War I,
[29:52.000 --> 29:54.000]  the United States of Empire,
[29:54.000 --> 29:57.000]  by James Dunn, available at Amazon Books.
[30:02.000 --> 30:05.000]  Listen, there's a show from PBS
[30:05.000 --> 30:07.000]  called It's Okay to Be Smart.
[30:07.000 --> 30:09.000]  So everyone who's been smart
[30:09.000 --> 30:11.000]  and has been put down for it
[30:11.000 --> 30:13.000]  and persecuted,
[30:13.000 --> 30:15.000]  it's okay to finally be smart.
[30:15.000 --> 30:17.000]  That's right, there's not two sexes
[30:17.000 --> 30:19.000]  and families are bad.
[30:19.000 --> 30:21.000]  And the right thing to do is to sterilize your son
[30:21.000 --> 30:23.000]  so he doesn't become an evil war monger.
[30:23.000 --> 30:24.000]  I mean, a lot of feminists are saying
[30:24.000 --> 30:26.000]  we should have the government passed laws
[30:26.000 --> 30:27.000]  that mail embryos at count.
[30:27.000 --> 30:29.000]  But what's better and more reformed
[30:29.000 --> 30:31.000]  and more humanitarian is to convince them
[30:31.000 --> 30:33.000]  when they're five years old,
[30:33.000 --> 30:35.000]  have their testicles chopped off,
[30:35.000 --> 30:36.000]  and again, global warming's real.
[30:36.000 --> 30:38.000]  We got to pay Lord Rothschild all of our money
[30:38.000 --> 30:39.000]  and the pandemic's all real.
[30:39.000 --> 30:41.000]  We've got to be locked up in our houses.
[30:41.000 --> 30:44.000]  We've got to use the language the universities say.
[30:44.000 --> 30:46.000]  We're not a culture or anything.
[30:46.000 --> 30:47.000]  No, no, we're not.
[30:47.000 --> 30:49.000]  We're good people.
[30:49.000 --> 30:51.000]  We're good people that went to these corporate systems
[30:51.000 --> 30:53.000]  that didn't brainwash us.
[30:53.000 --> 30:55.000]  No, no, they enlightened us
[30:55.000 --> 30:58.000]  how to censor and how to rule and how to control.
[30:58.000 --> 31:01.000]  One of the best nutrients nature has provided,
[31:01.000 --> 31:03.000]  beetroot, has been used for hundreds of years
[31:03.000 --> 31:04.000]  in natural medicine.
[31:04.000 --> 31:07.000]  Now you can experience the power of this ingredient today
[31:07.000 --> 31:09.000]  with VasoBeat from M4's Life.

[31:22.000 --> 31:24.000]  a healthy living or athletic performance.

[31:27.000 --> 31:54.000]  with VasoBeat from M4's Life.
[31:57.000 --> 31:59.000]  Brought to you by you.
[31:59.000 --> 32:03.000]  Every week, every day, every hour, every minute,
[32:03.000 --> 32:06.000]  every second right now is critical.
[32:06.000 --> 32:08.000]  History is happening right in front of us
[32:08.000 --> 32:10.000]  and we can't be spectators.
[32:10.000 --> 32:12.000]  We've got to be men and women in the arena,
[32:12.000 --> 32:14.000]  regardless of race, color, creed, age,
[32:14.000 --> 32:16.000]  sexual privacy, it doesn't matter.
[32:16.000 --> 32:18.000]  The globalists with the chai comms and others
[32:18.000 --> 32:20.000]  are openly trying to plunge their economy
[32:20.000 --> 32:21.000]  and start a new depression.
[32:21.000 --> 32:23.000]  China, who hyped up this virus,
[32:23.000 --> 32:25.000]  is now back to work in ramping up their economy
[32:25.000 --> 32:28.000]  while ours is going into a freefall spiral.
[32:28.000 --> 32:30.000]  And Trump's desperately trying to restart it
[32:30.000 --> 32:33.000]  and create confidence in the globalist corporate media
[32:33.000 --> 32:36.000]  that was worshiping China just a month or so ago
[32:36.000 --> 32:39.000]  and their response is saying Trump is terrible
[32:39.000 --> 32:41.000]  because they want America to fail,
[32:41.000 --> 32:44.000]  they want you to fail, but you could expose them,
[32:44.000 --> 32:46.000]  you could speak out, you could share the articles
[32:46.000 --> 32:48.000]  and videos and reports at InfoWars
[32:48.000 --> 32:50.000]  and Band-Aught Video that expose them
[32:50.000 --> 32:52.000]  and the globalist will go down.
[32:52.000 --> 32:54.000]  It's already blowing up in their face right now,
[32:54.000 --> 32:56.000]  so press the attack on the InfoWars
[32:56.000 --> 33:25.000]  and defeat the NWO.
[33:26.000 --> 33:39.000]  The United Nations, the club of Rome, Davos,
[33:39.000 --> 33:42.000]  the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation,
[33:42.000 --> 33:46.000]  meetings all on record want to depopulate
[33:46.000 --> 33:50.000]  the planet to at least 500 million people.
[33:50.000 --> 33:55.000]  That is a 90% reduction or more.
[33:55.000 --> 33:57.000]  And that's in their official documents
[33:57.000 --> 33:59.000]  that we've been flashing on screen
[33:59.000 --> 34:01.000]  in the Wall Street Journal of the New York Times
[34:01.000 --> 34:03.000]  telling you how they have a secret world government
[34:03.000 --> 34:05.000]  that they're now announcing to you,
[34:05.000 --> 34:07.000]  and now it's all official.
[34:07.000 --> 34:09.000]  Of course, run by Jeffrey Epstein at the time,
[34:09.000 --> 34:12.000]  there's 2009 Wall Street Journal.
[34:12.000 --> 34:15.000]  But you've got to be the saviors while you do it,
[34:15.000 --> 34:17.000]  so you release limited bio weapons,
[34:17.000 --> 34:19.000]  you hype it up,
[34:19.000 --> 34:21.000]  you exacerbate real occurring viruses,
[34:21.000 --> 34:23.000]  you train everyone to be under drone
[34:23.000 --> 34:26.000]  control and checkpoints, everyone complies with that,
[34:26.000 --> 34:28.000]  and then you incrementally during that crisis
[34:28.000 --> 34:30.000]  keep ratcheting it down to see how far you can go.
[34:30.000 --> 34:33.000]  Then a few years later, there's a worst bug that shows up.
[34:33.000 --> 34:36.000]  And then they do this in five waves and ten waves,
[34:36.000 --> 34:40.000]  but the final wave will drive
[34:40.000 --> 34:44.000]  the remaining 30, 40% of the population into Dome cities.
[34:44.000 --> 34:47.000]  Everyone else will be outside those cities,
[34:47.000 --> 34:49.000]  and the UN admits that's what they want to go to
[34:49.000 --> 34:51.000]  as a city state,
[34:51.000 --> 34:54.000]  and then you will be totally surveilled
[34:54.000 --> 34:56.000]  and controlled within those.
[34:56.000 --> 34:58.000]  And if you don't believe me, just type in smart cities,
[34:58.000 --> 35:01.000]  Google, Twitter, Facebook,
[35:01.000 --> 35:04.000]  Apple, and Amazon,
[35:04.000 --> 35:07.000]  all competing for the future smart cities
[35:07.000 --> 35:10.000]  that are sealed,
[35:10.000 --> 35:13.000]  totally and completely sealed.
[35:13.000 --> 35:16.000]  And they show children for over a decade in the UK and Europe
[35:16.000 --> 35:19.000]  in school little documentaries
[35:19.000 --> 35:22.000]  called Megaopolis and Others.
[35:22.000 --> 35:23.000]  Now, there it is right there.
[35:23.000 --> 35:28.000]  Google's planned for sealed Dome cities.
[35:28.000 --> 35:30.000]  And then you opt into those.
[35:30.000 --> 35:32.000]  Oh, there's no allergies.
[35:32.000 --> 35:34.000]  Oh, there's no viruses
[35:34.000 --> 35:38.000]  because everyone is scanned and medically tested to get in.
[35:38.000 --> 35:39.000]  You know, there's another movie.
[35:39.000 --> 35:42.000]  The Island came out, I don't know, 15 years ago or so,
[35:42.000 --> 35:46.000]  and they're all in this sealed Dome city for their safety.
[35:46.000 --> 35:50.000]  It's really out in Nevada,
[35:50.000 --> 35:53.000]  in the middle of the Death Valley,
[35:53.000 --> 35:57.000]  and they're the lucky ones that have gone to the island.
[35:57.000 --> 35:59.000]  They think they're in an island
[35:59.000 --> 36:01.000]  because they have plasma screens out of the windows
[36:01.000 --> 36:04.000]  or looking out on the ocean, but really it's the desert.
[36:04.000 --> 36:07.000]  Finally, they find out they're really just clones for rich people,
[36:07.000 --> 36:11.000]  but they have trouble keeping organs alive
[36:11.000 --> 36:15.000]  if they just breed them up in an artificial womb, a tank,
[36:15.000 --> 36:19.000]  but if they are human, they can live a long time.
[36:19.000 --> 36:21.000]  The organs stay fresh,
[36:21.000 --> 36:24.000]  and they tell them that everybody had to go to the island
[36:24.000 --> 36:26.000]  because a virus got released,
[36:26.000 --> 36:35.000]  and they're the last people left on Earth.
[36:35.000 --> 36:40.000]  See, you're so lucky you're going to get to go to the Dome cities,
[36:40.000 --> 36:44.000]  and Google and all of them are building them in Denver, in Austin,
[36:44.000 --> 36:48.000]  and in Toronto, and in London,
[36:48.000 --> 36:51.000]  they've set up their areas in industrial districts,
[36:51.000 --> 36:54.000]  like the old Austin Airport,
[36:54.000 --> 37:00.000]  not the one out at Bergstrom, but the old one, Mueller,
[37:00.000 --> 37:04.000]  and you opt into it,
[37:04.000 --> 37:06.000]  and they're even beginning to build the areas
[37:06.000 --> 37:09.000]  where building to building is connected, and it's a Dome.
[37:09.000 --> 37:11.000]  A little Dome, you learn to go in,
[37:11.000 --> 37:14.000]  and a bigger Dome, and a bigger Dome, and a bigger Dome,
[37:14.000 --> 37:20.000]  and a bigger Dome, and a bigger Dome, and a bigger Dome.
[37:20.000 --> 37:22.000]  All right, I got a lot of news I want to cover
[37:22.000 --> 37:24.000]  and a bunch of guests today, and I want to take calls,
[37:24.000 --> 37:27.000]  but let me just tell you how surreal things are
[37:27.000 --> 37:29.000]  and how serious things are.
[37:29.000 --> 37:34.000]  I got a call from a White House advisor,
[37:34.000 --> 37:38.000]  someone that advises the president on a daily basis,
[37:38.000 --> 37:42.000]  about a week ago, and they said,
[37:42.000 --> 37:45.000]  Alex, you know, the president just really wants to tell you
[37:45.000 --> 37:50.000]  that he appreciates you and he understands the attacks
[37:50.000 --> 37:54.000]  that we're all under and just, you know, stay the course,
[37:54.000 --> 37:56.000]  and the president admires what you're doing,
[37:56.000 --> 37:59.000]  and believe me, he intends to move on the deep state
[37:59.000 --> 38:03.000]  and he's moving against them, and that his main mission
[38:03.000 --> 38:05.000]  is to keep the economy going because if they can kill that,
[38:05.000 --> 38:08.000]  they'll understand everything else is going to be lost.
[38:08.000 --> 38:10.000]  And I'm like, okay, well, thanks for reaching out
[38:10.000 --> 38:13.000]  for the president.
[38:13.000 --> 38:16.000]  And the individual went on to say,
[38:16.000 --> 38:19.000]  you have to understand, we know the Democrats
[38:19.000 --> 38:22.000]  are basically paid for by the Chai comms
[38:22.000 --> 38:25.000]  and these multinational groups.
[38:25.000 --> 38:27.000]  And the guy, he was laughing, saying,
[38:27.000 --> 38:29.000]  it's just like a James Bond movie, like you say,
[38:29.000 --> 38:33.000]  it's like Spectre, where we didn't know James Bond movies
[38:33.000 --> 38:35.000]  was not the Russians or it's not the U.S.,
[38:35.000 --> 38:37.000]  it's an evil corporate group playing them off against each other.
[38:37.000 --> 38:39.000]  That's literally how this works.
[38:39.000 --> 38:42.000]  Of course, Ian Fleming was a high-level MI6
[38:42.000 --> 38:44.000]  before that OSS spy chief.
[38:44.000 --> 38:47.000]  I mean, he made a movie about the elites releasing a bio weapon
[38:47.000 --> 38:51.000]  to kill the entire human population while they go up on stations.
[38:51.000 --> 38:54.000]  It's the same thing, see, it's everywhere.
[38:54.000 --> 39:00.000]  But he was a good guy exposing it.
[39:00.000 --> 39:05.000]  And just the realization that Trump and Info Wars
[39:05.000 --> 39:07.000]  are some pot of code, not because I tell Trump
[39:07.000 --> 39:09.000]  what to think or what to do,
[39:09.000 --> 39:12.000]  but because we really do the research
[39:12.000 --> 39:14.000]  and Trump's got more and more good advisors
[39:14.000 --> 39:16.000]  from the Pentagon and other places
[39:16.000 --> 39:19.000]  that do see the big picture and know what the globalists are building
[39:19.000 --> 39:22.000]  and understand that it just cannot be allowed to happen.
[39:22.000 --> 39:28.000]  These are the people that created Hitler as a beta test.
[39:28.000 --> 39:31.000]  The Kaiser Wilhelm Institute was funded by the Rockefeller Foundation.
[39:31.000 --> 39:33.000]  Almost 100%.
[39:33.000 --> 39:35.000]  That and IBM, Thomas Watson.
[39:35.000 --> 39:37.000]  And they're the ones running the show today.
[39:37.000 --> 39:41.000]  And Thomas Watson, his foundation, funded Microsoft.
[39:41.000 --> 39:46.000]  Microsoft is an IBM spinoff to get around trust-busting.
[39:46.000 --> 39:48.000]  Bill Gates is IBM.
[39:48.000 --> 39:50.000]  He's an IBM war machine.
[39:50.000 --> 39:53.000]  And so all the stuff you see about him and IBM fighting,
[39:53.000 --> 39:55.000]  it's total crap.
[39:55.000 --> 39:59.000]  Gates's dad ran Planned Parenthood, ran secret army operations,
[39:59.000 --> 40:01.000]  Cold Springs Harbor.
[40:01.000 --> 40:04.000]  These guys mean...bidness.
[40:04.000 --> 40:06.000]  Okay?
[40:06.000 --> 40:09.000]  And so, yes, I risked my life taking them on,
[40:09.000 --> 40:12.000]  but we're all dead if we don't.
[40:12.000 --> 40:14.000]  And I see their argument.
[40:14.000 --> 40:16.000]  There's too many people. People are dumbed down.
[40:16.000 --> 40:18.000]  People are lazy. They're getting stupider.
[40:18.000 --> 40:20.000]  But they're putting floor out in the water
[40:20.000 --> 40:24.000]  and dumbing down the culture on purpose to make it worse.
[40:24.000 --> 40:29.000]  It'd be one thing if they just had to lift everybody up
[40:29.000 --> 40:31.000]  and then told poor people in places,
[40:31.000 --> 40:34.000]  hey, we'll give you money if you only have two kids or something.
[40:34.000 --> 40:37.000]  But they don't do that. It's all nasty.
[40:37.000 --> 40:39.000]  It's evil. And they target the smartest people
[40:39.000 --> 40:44.000]  because they're in competition with them. It's bad.
[40:44.000 --> 40:46.000]  So we're talking real world here.
[40:46.000 --> 40:50.000]  Well, I got a call this morning from another individual
[40:50.000 --> 40:53.000]  who's also a presidential advisor
[40:53.000 --> 40:56.000]  and who's also a very well-known national talk show host.
[40:56.000 --> 40:58.000]  I'll leave it at that.
[40:58.000 --> 41:01.000]  I mean, right at the top.
[41:01.000 --> 41:08.000]  And they showed me what is being circulated at Fox News.
[41:08.000 --> 41:14.000]  Got it right here.
[41:14.000 --> 41:18.000]  And there has been an attempt to take over at Fox
[41:18.000 --> 41:21.000]  by the Murdoch brothers.
[41:21.000 --> 41:23.000]  The attack on Trump during the last election
[41:23.000 --> 41:26.000]  and then early on when he was elected, it failed.
[41:26.000 --> 41:29.000]  They basically threatened everybody who is pro-Trump,
[41:29.000 --> 41:31.000]  but that didn't work.
[41:31.000 --> 41:35.000]  But they're being infiltrated with actual spies,
[41:35.000 --> 41:37.000]  corporate spies, but trained in espionage
[41:37.000 --> 41:42.000]  to set people up to absolutely harass them to...
[41:42.000 --> 41:43.000]  I'm not going to get into it,
[41:43.000 --> 41:45.000]  but let's just say a lot of the top posts aren't even there anymore.
[41:45.000 --> 41:49.000]  They're at remote locations for their own safety, basically.
[41:49.000 --> 41:51.000]  And that's how hot this war is.
[41:51.000 --> 41:58.000]  And it's confirmed that as soon as the Democrats
[41:58.000 --> 42:02.000]  try to steal this election and the globalists behind them
[42:02.000 --> 42:04.000]  that they're going to shut down the NRA,
[42:04.000 --> 42:08.000]  they did espionage infiltration under the stay-behind groups
[42:08.000 --> 42:10.000]  that Obama and Hillary set up.
[42:10.000 --> 42:12.000]  You know, the NRA was under investigation
[42:12.000 --> 42:13.000]  of being Russian agents.
[42:13.000 --> 42:14.000]  There was no truth to it.
[42:14.000 --> 42:18.000]  But still, they plan on basically killing the leadership
[42:18.000 --> 42:19.000]  of the NRA.
[42:19.000 --> 42:20.000]  They're just going to kill them.
[42:20.000 --> 42:21.000]  They're going to blow their heads off.
[42:21.000 --> 42:23.000]  And it's the level it's gotten to that now.
[42:23.000 --> 42:26.000]  The NRA was already shut down your media operations,
[42:26.000 --> 42:28.000]  shut down your offensive political stuff,
[42:28.000 --> 42:30.000]  or we're going to shut you down under campaign finance.
[42:30.000 --> 42:32.000]  You know, as they shut down all their operations
[42:32.000 --> 42:34.000]  six months ago.
[42:34.000 --> 42:37.000]  And they're basically telling Fox House to the grapevine
[42:37.000 --> 42:40.000]  that we'll shut you down one way or another
[42:40.000 --> 42:41.000]  once we get a Democrat in.
[42:41.000 --> 42:43.000]  So they're going to go full martial law,
[42:43.000 --> 42:47.000]  and info wars that's in the memo was the beta test.
[42:47.000 --> 42:49.000]  It's for everybody else after this.
[42:49.000 --> 42:51.000]  And so Trump's inaction standing up to this
[42:51.000 --> 42:53.000]  is inviting the next wave.
[42:53.000 --> 42:55.000]  Because every time the globalists lose,
[42:55.000 --> 42:56.000]  they just up the ante.
[42:56.000 --> 42:59.000]  They've got to be shut down.
[42:59.000 --> 43:03.000]  In a constant search to upgrade your favorite formulas,

[43:57.000 --> 44:00.000]  Alex Jones here with some good news.
[44:00.000 --> 44:02.000]  Two weeks ago we had to stop taking
[44:02.000 --> 44:04.000]  new storable food orders because
[44:04.000 --> 44:06.000]  the company that supplies us was backed up
[44:06.000 --> 44:08.000]  and was busy getting out the orders they had.
[44:08.000 --> 44:10.000]  Now they've opened up two more factories
[44:10.000 --> 44:12.000]  and they've bought a whole bunch more high quality food.
[44:12.000 --> 44:13.000]  They're packaging it right now
[44:13.000 --> 44:15.000]  and they're going to be able to ship it out to you very soon.
[44:15.000 --> 44:17.000]  So get your orders in now.
[44:17.000 --> 44:21.000]  Every other major food manufacturer in the storeable food area
[44:21.000 --> 44:23.000]  has been sold out for a long time.
[44:23.000 --> 44:25.000]  Many of them are still telling you they got food.
[44:25.000 --> 44:26.000]  They don't.
[44:26.000 --> 44:29.000]  We do, but it takes time to package it and get it out to you.
[44:29.000 --> 44:32.000]  The bad news is, hey, I hope the virus blows over,
[44:32.000 --> 44:35.000]  but the globalist trying to cancel the election
[44:35.000 --> 44:37.000]  and the economy may go south.
[44:37.000 --> 44:39.000]  Now more than ever is the time to have high quality
[44:39.000 --> 44:41.000]  and affordable food and the place to get it
[44:41.000 --> 44:43.000]  is infowarstore.com.
[44:43.000 --> 44:45.000]  So a lot of you got the food from us.
[44:45.000 --> 44:46.000]  You've loved it.
[44:46.000 --> 44:48.000]  It's been very helpful for you and your family.
[44:48.000 --> 44:50.000]  Now is the time to double down
[44:50.000 --> 44:52.000]  with as crazy as this world is.
[44:52.000 --> 44:54.000]  If they're able to take Trump down, we are screwed.
[44:54.000 --> 44:56.000]  We've got to fend for ourselves.
[44:56.000 --> 45:13.000]  And that's why we made one of our most popular formulas to date.
[45:13.000 --> 45:19.000]  Super male vitality specifically designed to assist the body
[45:19.000 --> 45:25.000]  in regulating proper balance to create superior vitality in males.
[45:25.000 --> 45:30.000]  Now look, this unique formula promotes your body's own natural responses
[45:30.000 --> 45:36.000]  and it contains no synthetic chemicals and no unwanted additives.
[45:36.000 --> 45:37.000]  Yes.
[45:37.000 --> 45:42.000]  We're talking about ancient wisdom combined with modern technology,
[45:42.000 --> 45:45.000]  working together in perfect synchronicity
[45:45.000 --> 45:49.000]  to help you get the most out of this herb-packed formula.
[45:49.000 --> 45:50.000]  So what are you waiting for?
[45:50.000 --> 45:52.000]  Go to the infowarstore.
[45:52.000 --> 45:55.000]  Get in a better time than right now.
[45:55.000 --> 45:59.000]  Super male vitality at infowarstore.com.
[45:59.000 --> 46:02.000]  Newtonian physics documents the fact that for every action,
[46:02.000 --> 46:05.000]  there's an opposite and equal reaction.
[46:05.000 --> 46:10.000]  And that matter is not destroyed, it is simply transferred into another form.
[46:10.000 --> 46:12.000]  Well, we're seeing that happen right now.
[46:12.000 --> 46:14.000]  The globalists are openly trying to hype up the coronavirus,
[46:14.000 --> 46:16.000]  trying to kill our economy,
[46:16.000 --> 46:19.000]  and trying to have martial law shutdown around the country,
[46:19.000 --> 46:24.000]  trying to stampede Trump into implementing it so they can blame the imploding economy on him.
[46:24.000 --> 46:28.000]  But Trump has seen through it and so he's let them implement the draconian controls
[46:28.000 --> 46:33.000]  and is saying, do you really want a depression for something that's killed far less than the flu?
[46:33.000 --> 46:36.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, now is the fight of our lives.
[46:36.000 --> 46:40.000]  And the good news is their attack on humanity and on independent media
[46:40.000 --> 46:43.000]  has caused a lot of people to start thinking for themselves.
[46:43.000 --> 46:50.000]  And so the traffic to infowarstore.com and band.video is triple our previous records right now.
[46:50.000 --> 46:52.000]  So you're doing a great job spreading the word
[46:52.000 --> 46:55.000]  and people are tuning in to find out the truth like never before
[46:55.000 --> 47:22.000]  because of you, the modern Paul Revere's.
[47:22.000 --> 47:34.000]  Waging war on corruption. It's Alex Jones.
[47:34.000 --> 47:38.000]  We are back live. We are broadcasting world-wide.
[47:38.000 --> 47:42.000]  Well, Brian Stelter has a new HBO documentary that they spent,
[47:42.000 --> 47:45.000]  at least I'm told, 15 minutes of lying about me.
[47:45.000 --> 47:50.000]  I've only seen parts of it, but we're going to get it and I'm going to analyze it.
[47:50.000 --> 47:53.000]  And why are we under attack? Because we are over the target.
[47:53.000 --> 47:54.000]  Look at this.
[47:54.000 --> 48:03.000]  Alex Jones, bogus coronavirus cures.
[48:03.000 --> 48:05.000]  And I just scanned over this article.
[48:05.000 --> 48:09.000]  It's a big story in New Yorker magazine.
[48:09.000 --> 48:12.000]  Department of snake oil.
[48:12.000 --> 48:19.000]  Nowhere did I ever say we had a cure for the corona virus.
[48:19.000 --> 48:25.000]  They say, I say we had a cure.
[48:25.000 --> 48:32.000]  And guess what happened, ladies and gentlemen, when the media all said that I had a cure,
[48:32.000 --> 48:35.000]  that I said that everybody came and bought up the rest of the toothpaste.
[48:35.000 --> 48:37.000]  I didn't even say it.
[48:37.000 --> 48:41.000]  But they're so untrusted, people thought, oh, Jones must have a cure.
[48:41.000 --> 48:42.000]  I never said that.
[48:42.000 --> 48:43.000]  Didn't say it was a treatment.
[48:43.000 --> 48:48.000]  It's marketed as whitening toothpaste.
[48:48.000 --> 48:54.000]  But it has nano silver in it.
[48:54.000 --> 48:59.000]  And they said, oh, Jones says in studies it kills viruses at point blank range.
[48:59.000 --> 49:02.000]  Point blank range means sunlight does that.
[49:02.000 --> 49:06.000]  I was explaining that the problem is you can't get into your lungs.
[49:06.000 --> 49:11.000]  I was separately talking about point blank means silver is electrical just like copper
[49:11.000 --> 49:12.000]  and it's antiviral.
[49:12.000 --> 49:13.000]  Everybody knows that.
[49:13.000 --> 49:14.000]  Didn't say it was a treatment or a cure.
[49:14.000 --> 49:17.000]  It's whitening toothpaste.
[49:17.000 --> 49:21.000]  Now, we sold out of that.
[49:21.000 --> 49:22.000]  Super blue.
[49:22.000 --> 49:24.000]  We sold for almost five years.
[49:24.000 --> 49:25.000]  It's incredibly popular.
[49:25.000 --> 49:29.000]  My dad, a dentist, developed it.
[49:29.000 --> 49:30.000]  It's fluoride free.
[49:30.000 --> 49:35.000]  It's got nano silver from the same company that's patented.
[49:35.000 --> 49:40.000]  And it's got tea tree that's well known to be very good for you in an antiviral natural.
[49:40.000 --> 49:42.000]  British Harvey's used it for 200 years.
[49:42.000 --> 49:45.000]  And it's got iodine in it.
[49:45.000 --> 49:47.000]  And people love it.
[49:47.000 --> 49:48.000]  It's a concentrate.
[49:48.000 --> 49:49.000]  Doesn't have filler in it.
[49:49.000 --> 49:50.000]  It's a popular thing.
[49:50.000 --> 49:51.000]  We're selling a lot of that.
[49:51.000 --> 49:53.000]  It'll sell out soon.
[49:53.000 --> 49:54.000]  Super blue.
[49:54.000 --> 49:59.000]  And again, it comes out white turns blue because it has pure iodine.
[49:59.000 --> 50:02.000]  The atomic type turns blue, not red.
[50:02.000 --> 50:05.000]  That's the crappy bad iodine.
[50:05.000 --> 50:08.000]  And it looks red in its one form turns blue in oxygen.
[50:08.000 --> 50:11.000]  That's why my dad gave it the name super blue.
[50:11.000 --> 50:12.000]  I thought it was a weird name.
[50:12.000 --> 50:15.000]  It's incredibly popular.
[50:15.000 --> 50:16.000]  My dad invented it.
[50:16.000 --> 50:17.000]  He came up with it.
[50:17.000 --> 50:20.000]  And now we have the whitening toothpaste.
[50:20.000 --> 50:23.000]  Came out five, six, six, I guess about six months ago.
[50:23.000 --> 50:28.000]  It's been even more popular because I guess the tube is fancier and shiny.
[50:28.000 --> 50:32.000]  And it's a great toothpaste.
[50:32.000 --> 50:40.000]  It has above sea coral calcium that is known to remelarize the teeth.
[50:40.000 --> 50:41.000]  And people love it.
[50:41.000 --> 50:43.000]  And quite frankly, it's even more popular than super blue.
[50:43.000 --> 50:44.000]  I don't know why.
[50:44.000 --> 50:48.000]  Super blue, if you wanted to get into being antimicrobial, I mean,
[50:48.000 --> 50:52.000]  it's got the same amount of silver in it and tea tree and the iodine.
[50:52.000 --> 50:54.000]  The whitening does not have that.
[50:54.000 --> 50:55.000]  It's a whitening toothpaste.
[50:55.000 --> 51:02.000]  This is for in your mouth, just like other toothpaste is, or just like mouthwash is,
[51:02.000 --> 51:03.000]  just like listerine.
[51:03.000 --> 51:04.000]  It says anti-macterial.
[51:04.000 --> 51:05.000]  It's what it is.
[51:05.000 --> 51:07.000]  Will listerine cure you of the coronavirus?
[51:07.000 --> 51:08.000]  No.
[51:08.000 --> 51:10.000]  Will it disinfect your mouth?
[51:10.000 --> 51:11.000]  Yes.
[51:11.000 --> 51:12.000]  Do I sell listerine?
[51:12.000 --> 51:13.000]  No.
[51:13.000 --> 51:17.000]  But the whole history of it, use the Civil War, aerosolized over surgeries,
[51:17.000 --> 51:22.000]  really produced a number of people that lost their limbs or died from gangrene,
[51:22.000 --> 51:25.000]  gangrenous.
[51:25.000 --> 51:30.000]  So huge article, how I'm a scammer, Dr. McCamshaw, please, Alex Jones,
[51:30.000 --> 51:34.000]  bogus coronavirus and, oh, look, he's a bad guy selling toothpaste.
[51:34.000 --> 51:38.000]  And they just misrepresent the whole damn thing.
[51:38.000 --> 51:44.000]  And then they, of course, attack Trump because he's putting out fake hope as well.
[51:44.000 --> 51:48.000]  Oh, funny, he was going off to the European Union's own statements and doctor's statements
[51:48.000 --> 51:53.000]  about hydroxychloroquine.
[51:53.000 --> 52:00.000]  And now, yesterday, the FDA approved it for coronavirus patients because the doctors,
[52:00.000 --> 52:07.000]  Fauci said last week, I would prescribe this to someone with COVID-19.
[52:07.000 --> 52:12.000]  And Trump's like, yeah, well, we'll have some hope.
[52:12.000 --> 52:13.000]  We're looking into that.
[52:13.000 --> 52:15.000]  And now it's boom approved.
[52:15.000 --> 52:20.000]  They took us off Google Play with our very successful five-star app saying,
[52:20.000 --> 52:21.000]  look at this video.
[52:21.000 --> 52:23.000]  Jones is putting out false treatments.
[52:23.000 --> 52:29.000]  I covered Fox News and Sean Hannity and Tucker Carlson showing what medical doctors in New
[52:29.000 --> 52:36.000]  York said about hydroxychloroquine with ZPAC antibiotic and 250 milligrams of zinc a day,
[52:36.000 --> 52:37.000]  which is a humongous dose.
[52:37.000 --> 52:38.000]  I'm not saying take that.
[52:38.000 --> 52:39.000]  That's doctors.
[52:39.000 --> 52:40.000]  I've looked it up.
[52:40.000 --> 52:41.000]  I think that's toxic.
[52:41.000 --> 52:44.000]  But yeah, I was talking to a medical doctor on the phone.
[52:44.000 --> 52:45.000]  I said, well, you frontload it.
[52:45.000 --> 52:46.000]  OK, whatever.
[52:46.000 --> 52:48.000]  I'm not telling you about it.
[52:48.000 --> 52:49.000]  You go talk to physicians.
[52:49.000 --> 52:54.000]  Don't listen to Governor Cuomo banning hydroxychloroquine last week, threatening to arrest doctors
[52:54.000 --> 52:55.000]  or take their licenses.
[52:55.000 --> 52:57.000]  Don't listen to the governor of Michigan.
[52:57.000 --> 52:58.000]  They don't want hope.
[52:58.000 --> 53:02.000]  They're telling you there's no respirators when they got thousands of them.
[53:02.000 --> 53:04.000]  They're lying to you.
[53:04.000 --> 53:11.000]  And that shows what stinking villains these people are that they want that type of fear.
[53:11.000 --> 53:13.000]  We're the one said gets durable food.
[53:13.000 --> 53:15.700]  We're the one said they'll use a virus for a global lockdown.
[53:15.700 --> 53:18.700]  We're the one said they'd use droves to control you when it happened because I'm reading the
[53:18.700 --> 53:22.000]  Rockefeller reports lockstep and others.
[53:22.000 --> 53:28.800]  I've made three hour films like in game blueprint for global enslavement.
[53:28.800 --> 53:36.800]  It was the inspiration for the Marvel in game.
[53:36.800 --> 53:39.800]  This is the reality, ladies and gentlemen.
[53:39.800 --> 53:42.800]  Info wars was the inspiration for the new X files.
[53:42.800 --> 53:45.800]  Chris Carter said it in the news.
[53:45.800 --> 53:47.800]  And it's not about how great we are.
[53:47.800 --> 53:54.800]  It's about how scared the globalist are that this is the reality.
[53:54.800 --> 54:02.800]  And these monsters went to the attorney general of New York and tried to get me arrested.
[54:02.800 --> 54:10.800]  They tried to absolutely say I was a criminal and made up what I said and took things out of context.
[54:10.800 --> 54:18.800]  And now Tucker Carlson has had his tweets about hydroxychloroquine removed off of Twitter.
[54:18.800 --> 54:28.800]  So has Sean Hannity. They're erasing the president's tweets. It's not even an issue and Balasaro had his tweets deleted yesterday.
[54:28.800 --> 54:41.800]  For a speech about hydroxychloroquine and how in European studies 97% or higher recovery rates if they get to you early with the chloroquine.
[54:41.800 --> 54:44.800]  Another thing I said in the video, I don't sell tonic water.
[54:44.800 --> 54:46.800]  It's called tonic. That means medical water.
[54:46.800 --> 54:50.800]  It's just grandfathered in. It's got chloroquine in it that they make the drug out of.
[54:50.800 --> 55:02.800]  And I know people at hospitals, doctors, before they wouldn't let them give them chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, that doctors were giving people this because they can't stop a doctor giving somebody tonic water.
[55:02.800 --> 55:06.800]  Now that it's approved for the doctors, they're giving it. They're giving them the drug.
[55:06.800 --> 55:12.800]  But the drug companies don't want that information known. They don't want you to have hope.
[55:12.800 --> 55:26.800]  So we're all about you being self-sufficient, you being healthy, you having firearms, knowing how to use them, you having storeable food, you planting a garden and having strong humans for a strong future, a pro-human future.
[55:26.800 --> 55:32.800]  And these monsters don't want it. And so they say, I'm a snake oil salesman.
[55:32.800 --> 55:35.800]  And what's crazy is people hate mainstream news so much.
[55:35.800 --> 55:42.800]  I had family, neighbors, people calling the phones around, going, you've got a cure. And we had to get on the phone and say, we've never said that.
[55:42.800 --> 55:48.800]  It's not a treatment. Silver is antiviral, antibacterial.
[55:48.800 --> 55:53.800]  And here's the American Biotech company that had the Pentagon certified for other things they use it for.
[55:53.800 --> 56:02.800]  And this is what's really going on. It's the congressional record that the Central Command, Special Operations Command in 2003 and 2005 tested it, certified.
[56:02.800 --> 56:09.800]  It's the best thing they use for Special Operations troops for sanitization because alcohol disappears in about a minute or two.
[56:09.800 --> 56:14.800]  But the nano silver on the surface stays there until you remove it.
[56:14.800 --> 56:25.800]  Comprende? And they're pissed, man, that I'm giving you Department of Army documents, that I'm telling you about all sorts of stuff like vitamin D3 and sunshine and pure water and all this stuff.
[56:25.800 --> 56:32.800]  They don't want that. But I'll tell you when I am selling, that's victory and freedom and having a spirit of standing up against these control freaks.
[56:32.800 --> 56:41.800]  They jump the shark trying to say the president shouldn't say hydroxychloroquine's good and others and trying to say he was doing bad things when he was giving people truth and hope.
[56:41.800 --> 56:44.800]  But what is back is food. We can now sell storeable food again.
[56:44.800 --> 56:49.800]  We had to stop for two weeks because they had to fill out the orders they had, had to get more food in.
[56:49.800 --> 56:56.800]  They opened two more factories, highest quality. The prices stayed low. Get your orders in now because the economy, the crazy election, the world's never going to be the same.
[56:56.800 --> 57:01.800]  You need to be prepared and you need to get high quality storeable food at infowarstore.com.
[57:01.800 --> 57:07.800]  Anybody else telling you they've got it is lying to you unless they're charging you grocery store prices. Then they can get your food.
[57:07.800 --> 57:12.800]  But this is five times cheaper than you're going to get at the grocery store because there's no middlemen and it funds the info war.
[57:12.800 --> 57:19.800]  So infowarstore.com, get your orders in now so you get it and you get a great price with all the inflation that's coming.
[57:19.800 --> 57:28.800]  You'll be able to, again, eat your insurance one way or another and it's an investment that cannot fail unless you don't take action and get that order in at infowarstore.com.
[57:28.800 --> 57:33.800]  They are so pissed that we're still on air and that we told you to prep and we've been proven right about all this.
[57:33.800 --> 57:37.800]  They just don't know what to do. They're so angry that they're all collapsing and everyone hates them.
[57:37.800 --> 57:46.800]  But you're tuning in and you're spreading the word and overriding these leftist, globalist, anti-human, anti-American, lying scum whose power is over.
[57:46.800 --> 57:55.800]  Hey, listen. Alex Jones and the Resistance are still on air. They're at Band-Aid video and infowarstore.com.
[57:55.800 --> 58:01.800]  All you gotta do is go to infowarstore.com. For its last show, you'll find Alex Jones' broadcast live.
[58:01.800 --> 58:07.800]  You'll find Owen Schroer at the War Room, David Knight and so much more special broadcast films.
[58:07.800 --> 58:14.800]  Emergency reports get all there and the globalists have worked around the clock to take them off air but something's happening.
[58:14.800 --> 58:20.800]  The public has been spreading the word that the Forbidden Truth lives at infowarstore.com.
[58:20.800 --> 58:26.800]  For its last show on Band-Aid video and it's growing exponentially and the attempts to censor are only backfiring.
[58:26.800 --> 58:34.800]  But we can supercharge this right now. If all of you listening realize, hey, you know how to find the show but other people don't.
[58:34.800 --> 58:41.800]  They believe mainstream media that was off the air so you can override the corporate media, the establishment, all of them at this critical time
[58:41.800 --> 59:06.800]  and tell folks that the truth lives and is back on air at infowarstore.com.
[59:06.800 --> 59:13.800]  For 24 years, Alex Jones and InfoWars have been sounding the alarm for patriots worldwide.
[59:13.800 --> 59:24.800]  Waking people up to the New World Order, Bohemian Grove, the American Deep State, the rise of Communist China,
[59:24.800 --> 59:32.800]  the plan for global depopulation and global elite pedophiles who prey off of our young.
[59:32.800 --> 59:38.800]  The enemy has done their best to destroy us but because of your support, our fight continues.
[59:38.800 --> 59:44.800]  Join us, support the Info War and together we will slay the dragon.
[59:44.800 --> 1:00:03.800]  Keep fighting, Alan, you're the gladiator.
[1:00:03.800 --> 1:00:14.800]  Well, last night I watched the two hours of nearly commercial free. We just run six minutes an hour for the local stations to have some ad time
[1:00:14.800 --> 1:00:19.800]  of the new TV slash radio show with Robert Barnes, American Countdown, and it was really good.
[1:00:19.800 --> 1:00:24.800]  Here's just a few minutes of it that I'm going to come back in the main transmission, get to all the big breaking news and special guests.
[1:00:24.800 --> 1:00:33.800]  Here's just a few minutes from the new show, 7 to 9 weeknights at Band-Aught Video and on our TV and radio satellites at InfoWars.com for its last show.
[1:00:33.800 --> 1:01:02.800]  American Countdown.
[1:01:02.800 --> 1:01:08.800]  Welcome tonight to the very first episode of American Countdown. We're going to be discussing the pandemic.
[1:01:08.800 --> 1:01:13.800]  Tonight resolved that the pandemic is more panic than play.
[1:01:13.800 --> 1:01:17.800]  Instead, and part of our opening statement, let's look at the evidence.
[1:01:17.800 --> 1:01:26.800]  This pandemic has been used as a pretext, as a premise for a power grab by governors, by mayors, by town managers even,
[1:01:26.800 --> 1:01:33.800]  all across America in ways that have never happened in American history, that are unprecedented, that are unparalleled.
[1:01:33.800 --> 1:01:39.800]  Our constitutional forefounders determined, year, determined way back in the late 1700s,
[1:01:39.800 --> 1:01:45.800]  that our country did not have any exception for national emergencies from constitutional liberties.
[1:01:45.800 --> 1:01:53.800]  There is no reference to pandemics or viruses or public health crises or declaration of emergencies in the Constitution.
[1:01:53.800 --> 1:01:57.800]  There's nothing in there that says that the First Amendment to the United States Constitution,
[1:01:57.800 --> 1:02:01.800]  or the Second, or the Fourth, or the Fifth, or the Six, or that any of the Bill of Rights,
[1:02:01.800 --> 1:02:11.800]  or that any other aspect of the Constitution can simply be discarded with a politician declaring that we are now in a case of a public health crisis.
[1:02:11.800 --> 1:02:22.800]  And our founders were far more in the founding family and the founding generations, were far more familiar with the issues of pandemics and plagues and viruses,
[1:02:22.800 --> 1:02:31.800]  than we even are today. And yet they chose not to form any exception or exemption, as a federal court determined today in Austin, Texas,
[1:02:31.800 --> 1:02:40.800]  though ironically, only for Planned Parenthood so far. So apparently, essential services includes abortion, but doesn't include church,
[1:02:40.800 --> 1:02:47.800]  doesn't include the right to purchase a gun for your own defense, doesn't purchase, doesn't include the right to have free assembly,
[1:02:47.800 --> 1:02:55.800]  either in church or for political purposes, doesn't include the right to privacy under the Fourth Amendment unless it's for an abortion,
[1:02:55.800 --> 1:03:01.800]  doesn't include the right to your business or your property under the Fifth Amendment unless, of course, it's Planned Parenthood.
[1:03:01.800 --> 1:03:11.800]  So the court's decision was right on the Constitution, but those principles of essential services should be extended and applied to all constitutionally protected liberties,
[1:03:11.800 --> 1:03:18.800]  not just the ones the Left celebrates. But that isn't the only issue with this pandemic that is more panic than play.
[1:03:18.800 --> 1:03:28.800]  For example, if we examine the data behind the pandemic, we find that not only is it being used as a pretext for a political power grab that's beyond the constitutional constraint
[1:03:28.800 --> 1:03:37.800]  and is unprecedented in American legal history, but in addition to that, it is being used, of course, to crush the economy and facilitate Wall Street bailouts
[1:03:37.800 --> 1:03:44.800]  of an unprecedented portion with the Fed committing to printing trillions of dollars to help their friends on Wall Street in corporate America
[1:03:44.800 --> 1:03:52.800]  while ordinary Americans go to record levels of unemployment. At the same time, it endangers the reelection bid of President Trump,
[1:03:52.800 --> 1:04:00.800]  who had done such a good job rebuilding the economy over the past three years, only to see it ripped away from him under this pandemic panic.
[1:04:00.800 --> 1:04:06.800]  But it goes beyond that. Let's look at the actual data in the pandemic data itself.
[1:04:06.800 --> 1:04:15.800]  So according to the various models that originally came out of places like Imperial College in the UK and other places that were relied upon in the West,
[1:04:15.800 --> 1:04:21.800]  this pandemic was going to be completely unique. This virus was going to be unlike any virus in modern history.
[1:04:21.800 --> 1:04:31.800]  So for example, if we look at and contextualize the information by history, we find that in fact most viruses in the modern medical era in the last century or so
[1:04:31.800 --> 1:04:40.800]  does not have a wide infection rate over a compressed timetable. On average, what will happen is that a virus will expand at a rate of the worst version of a virus,
[1:04:40.800 --> 1:04:49.800]  the Spanish flu in 1918. Over a three month time period, its highest infection rate in any region exposed was approximately 10% of the population.
[1:04:49.800 --> 1:04:56.800]  All right, folks, we'll be right back. By the way, I was just watching Fox Business and they're getting coffee and they were showing the fake footage from mentally saying it was New York.
[1:04:56.800 --> 1:05:03.800]  I just want to finish by saying your reputation is amazing. I will not let you down. You will be very, very impressed, I hope.
[1:05:03.800 --> 1:05:08.800]  You'll be looking at me in a year and a year or two years. Let's give me a little bit of time to run things.
[1:05:08.800 --> 1:05:14.800]  But a year into office, you'll be saying, wow, I remember that interview. He said he was going to do it and he did a great job.
[1:05:14.800 --> 1:05:16.800]  You'll be very proud of our country.
[1:05:16.800 --> 1:05:31.800]  Four years ago, then billionaire businessman Donald Trump pledged himself to info wars in our audience that he would not let us down, that he would take the globalist on and that we would be very pleased with what he did.
[1:05:31.800 --> 1:05:40.800]  We are pleased with President Trump. He has proven that he's the real deal and has taken the globalist on at a level that we've ever seen.
[1:05:40.800 --> 1:05:46.800]  Now they're striking back at President Trump and the people using the invisible weapon of fear, the coronavirus.
[1:05:46.800 --> 1:06:15.800]  Yes, we should meet the virus head on. Yes, we should save as many people as possible, but not at the expense of our hard-fought liberties and freedoms.
[1:06:16.800 --> 1:06:28.800]  You can hear it. You can hear it. You want to make it.
[1:06:28.800 --> 1:06:46.800]  We are live broadcasting worldwide from Texas. It is March 31 on this Tuesday edition, 216 days left until this unbelievable election.
[1:06:46.800 --> 1:06:53.800]  And if the deep state Democrats get back into power, they're going to release more bio weapons, even more deadly.
[1:06:53.800 --> 1:07:00.800]  They're going to lock everything down. They're going to arrest everybody. They're going to start a civil war. We've got to overt it.
[1:07:00.800 --> 1:07:10.800]  All right, in this hour, I'm going to cover all the huge breaking news. Just unbelievable how clear the picture is getting of exactly what happened and what's coming next.
[1:07:10.800 --> 1:07:24.800]  I want to open the phones up for first-time callers in this hour ahead of Jeff Nyquist joining us. Great journalist analyzing what's happening.
[1:07:24.800 --> 1:07:46.800]  I gave Paul the inside baseball this morning on the presidential advisor and the big national media figure that also advisors the president and on what they told me in the last week this morning and last week, and I went ahead and decided to talk about it today.
[1:07:46.800 --> 1:07:58.800]  Because I think now is the time to get into it, but it's just so crazy. But it's happening. And you just can't believe it.
[1:07:58.800 --> 1:08:04.800]  And I'm up here on air saying these things that I know are true, but it just sounds like it's not real.
[1:08:04.800 --> 1:08:27.800]  Like, we're getting locked down. Drones are controlling us. We're under AI surveillance. Big Tech is censoring Trump. Tucker Carlson, Sean Hannity, Jar Balasaro saying hydroxychlorical has been approved in Europe and did great with people that had COVID-19 and that doctors have been prescribing it off, labeled with great results.
[1:08:27.800 --> 1:08:38.800]  And so they took me off Google for saying what the president said, and then now they've got huge articles out attacking me, and they're now going out to Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity and the president and the president of Brazil.
[1:08:38.800 --> 1:08:54.800]  What the hell? That's in the news today.
[1:08:54.800 --> 1:09:06.800]  Two weeks ago, a week ago, all these governors shot their mouths off and said, you prescribed that. We'll have your ass arrested or lose your license. The media's like, President Trump, shut up.
[1:09:06.800 --> 1:09:13.800]  There's doctors that told him that. Since when can the president not talk only who the media approves?
[1:09:13.800 --> 1:09:25.800]  The same media that says that we're all doomed. The same media that tells us we shouldn't be carrying or watching the president's press conferences.
[1:09:25.800 --> 1:09:38.800]  Let me just read to you some of what's going around at Fox News. And again, this isn't even from the sources. This is just a separate thing I was sent.
[1:09:38.800 --> 1:09:47.800]  If the Democrats win in November, they're going to crush Fox News just as they've crushed the NRA. And we're going to deeply regret letting it happen.
[1:09:47.800 --> 1:09:56.800]  Everyone who thought it was fine when he platformed Alex Jones will look like an effing moron.
[1:09:56.800 --> 1:10:07.800]  That's the type of stuff going on in memos at the highest levels of Fox News. I'm not going to read you the rest.
[1:10:07.800 --> 1:10:12.800]  The folks giving me this stuff don't even say don't say my name. They just know I'm not going to.
[1:10:12.800 --> 1:10:23.800]  But I'm sure everybody can get a good idea. But I was told a lot more last week by White House advisor, the president,
[1:10:23.800 --> 1:10:31.800]  that they understand that the deep state wants to overthrow the economy, bankrupt everybody. That's in Cloward and Piven.
[1:10:31.800 --> 1:10:40.800]  They want race war and they're sold out in the chai comms and they're betting against America. And it's very sad. It is disgusting. It is horrifying.
[1:10:40.800 --> 1:10:52.800]  877-789-2539, 877-789-2539, 877-789-2539 is for people in the United States and for folks overseas that are able to use 1-800 number.
[1:10:52.800 --> 1:11:04.800]  Some folks can't. If you're on one of those computer lines or whatever, you dial your country code in 512-646-1776, 512-646-1776 or 877-789-Alex.
[1:11:04.800 --> 1:11:10.800]  And I just want to take your calls on all these issues.
[1:11:10.800 --> 1:11:19.800]  You know, I think the best thing for me to do is just read headlines in the rest of the segment.
[1:11:19.800 --> 1:11:30.800]  But do you understand that I've got Democrats trying to plant child porn on us?
[1:11:30.800 --> 1:11:34.800]  I've got Democrats trying to put me in prison right now.
[1:11:34.800 --> 1:11:39.800]  I've got them doing dirty tricks that are just over the top, the first security reasons I won't get into on air.
[1:11:39.800 --> 1:11:45.800]  A lot of people hear that and they go, oh, well, I better be scared and roll over. No, you better politically get in their face.
[1:11:45.800 --> 1:11:52.800]  You can't bow to bullies like this and let them piss on you and tell you it's rain running down your back.
[1:11:52.800 --> 1:11:59.800]  It's just going to get worse from there on out.
[1:11:59.800 --> 1:12:05.800]  Things are out of control and we've put up with so much that it's inexorably going to the next level.
[1:12:05.800 --> 1:12:09.800]  It gets worse and worse and worse.
[1:12:09.800 --> 1:12:13.800]  So people say, how are you handling all this?
[1:12:13.800 --> 1:12:20.800]  I expect to be attacked by tyrants, but I expect you to get upset about it and see it's a threat to you and your family
[1:12:20.800 --> 1:12:26.800]  and to politically demand Congress take action and the president take action now.
[1:12:26.800 --> 1:12:31.800]  Because this is concerted organized crime now censoring the president's tweets.
[1:12:31.800 --> 1:12:35.800]  Two years ago, I saw them shadow banning the president's tweets.
[1:12:35.800 --> 1:12:38.800]  Now they just outright delete them.
[1:12:38.800 --> 1:12:43.800]  And now it's the Brazilian president.
[1:12:43.800 --> 1:12:47.800]  And now it's Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity.
[1:12:47.800 --> 1:12:49.800]  In fact, that's the part I didn't get to right here.
[1:12:49.800 --> 1:12:51.800]  They are now censoring.
[1:12:51.800 --> 1:12:52.800]  I've got the tweets right here.
[1:12:52.800 --> 1:13:05.800]  And we're also used to this now that there's not even articles about this hardly about Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity having their tweets deleted.
[1:13:05.800 --> 1:13:09.800]  And admitted treatment now approved.
[1:13:09.800 --> 1:13:10.800]  There are no ventilators.
[1:13:10.800 --> 1:13:11.800]  There is no hope.
[1:13:11.800 --> 1:13:12.800]  You're all dead.
[1:13:12.800 --> 1:13:13.800]  10 million are dead.
[1:13:13.800 --> 1:13:14.800]  2 million are dead.
[1:13:14.800 --> 1:13:15.800]  100,000 are dead.
[1:13:15.800 --> 1:13:18.800]  They keep moving the number down.
[1:13:18.800 --> 1:13:30.800]  Here's one Gretchen to thank you at Twitter for banning incredibly dangerous news coming from some Fox News hosts like Laura Ingram during the coronavirus pandemic.
[1:13:30.800 --> 1:13:34.800]  Sad to say a huge part of America believe it.
[1:13:34.800 --> 1:13:42.800]  They have a whole article about Ingram talked about a New York City hospital that was prescribing hydroxychloroquine and ZPAC and zinc and getting great results.
[1:13:42.800 --> 1:13:53.800]  And it's a big article about how it's been flagged and how they're taking down their tweets.
[1:13:53.800 --> 1:13:55.800]  I mean, think about that, man.
[1:13:55.800 --> 1:14:09.800]  They talk about censorship, the president, national talk show host, and then the media lies, the media that doesn't have any viewers and goes, oh, look, Laura Ingram and Sean Hannity, you're talking about this with doctors.
[1:14:09.800 --> 1:14:10.800]  They're not allowed to do that.
[1:14:10.800 --> 1:14:12.800]  That's not approved.
[1:14:12.800 --> 1:14:14.800]  What?
[1:14:14.800 --> 1:14:19.800]  Every time there's been an outbreak or a problem, people look at unapproved promising treatments and things off label.
[1:14:19.800 --> 1:14:24.800]  But now you're not supposed to choose your spouse to have no hope.
[1:14:24.800 --> 1:14:27.800]  Well, now it's approved.
[1:14:27.800 --> 1:14:28.800]  But you know what?
[1:14:28.800 --> 1:14:29.800]  It doesn't even matter.
[1:14:29.800 --> 1:14:30.800]  There's still articles everywhere.
[1:14:30.800 --> 1:14:39.800]  They came out with one today attacking yours truly in New Yorker magazine from the Department of Snake Oil.
[1:14:39.800 --> 1:14:42.800]  April 6th, just to be in the print edition.
[1:14:42.800 --> 1:14:44.800]  So they're five days ahead, six days ahead.
[1:14:44.800 --> 1:14:47.800]  Alex Jones, bogus coronavirus cures.
[1:14:47.800 --> 1:14:50.800]  Boy, you don't have me saying cure, do you?
[1:14:50.800 --> 1:14:56.800]  And it goes on attack the president for hydroxychloricin because they already wrote the article on approved drugs.
[1:14:56.800 --> 1:14:59.800]  Oh, how dare the president hydroxychloricin.
[1:14:59.800 --> 1:15:02.800]  How dare him?
[1:15:02.800 --> 1:15:05.800]  How dare you?
[1:15:05.800 --> 1:15:07.800]  Zinc doesn't help you.
[1:15:07.800 --> 1:15:08.800]  Sunshine doesn't help you.
[1:15:08.800 --> 1:15:10.800]  Vitamin D doesn't help you.
[1:15:10.800 --> 1:15:11.800]  Silver doesn't help you.
[1:15:11.800 --> 1:15:13.800]  Hydroxychloricin doesn't help you.
[1:15:13.800 --> 1:15:18.800]  But Bill Gates coming up in six months, he's got a vaccine for you.
[1:15:18.800 --> 1:15:21.800]  It's going to help you real good.
[1:15:21.800 --> 1:15:22.800]  You don't need oxygen.
[1:15:22.800 --> 1:15:24.800]  You don't need water.
[1:15:24.800 --> 1:15:25.800]  You don't need food.
[1:15:25.800 --> 1:15:27.800]  You need nothing but vaccines.
[1:15:27.800 --> 1:15:32.800]  You can live off nothing but vaccines.
[1:15:32.800 --> 1:15:35.800]  Of course, that's not true, but that's what they would tell you.
[1:15:35.800 --> 1:15:39.800]  Man cannot live by tainted vaccines alone.
[1:15:39.800 --> 1:15:46.800]  Crumb, the eugenics commander in chief.
[1:15:46.800 --> 1:15:48.800]  Oh, there's the Washington Post.
[1:15:48.800 --> 1:15:50.800]  We're luckily admitting we're all right.
[1:15:50.800 --> 1:15:52.800]  Oh, sorry, you're wrong again, scum.
[1:15:52.800 --> 1:15:55.800]  On purpose you were wrong.
[1:15:55.800 --> 1:15:58.800]  Attention all radio listeners, who still need food supplies?
[1:15:58.800 --> 1:16:05.800]  If you've thought about the implication of food-related supply chain disruptions and are concerned about the coming quarantines,
[1:16:05.800 --> 1:16:08.800]  this will be the most important message you will ever hear.
[1:16:08.800 --> 1:16:09.800]  Here's why.
[1:16:09.800 --> 1:16:13.800]  In the next few days, all Americans will face extremely hard choices.
[1:16:13.800 --> 1:16:16.800]  We've learned anything from China and Italy.
[1:16:16.800 --> 1:16:21.800]  It's that quarantines and enforced lockdowns are just a few days away here in the U.S.
[1:16:21.800 --> 1:16:24.800]  Listen, while dehydrated food is becoming scarce,
[1:16:24.800 --> 1:16:29.800]  you can still get enough open pollinated heirloom seeds to grow a one-acre crisis garden.
[1:16:29.800 --> 1:16:36.800]  The truth is, growing nutrient-dense vegetables in the days ahead may actually be the single most important thing you do.

[1:20:07.800 --> 1:20:28.800]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[1:20:28.800 --> 1:20:41.800]  Standing high atop the New York Skyline, from Midtown Manhattan, is a red foreboding tower.
[1:20:41.800 --> 1:20:53.800]  No, Soran's fortress is not descended like an alien spacecraft landing on the island.
[1:20:53.800 --> 1:21:12.800]  It is the Empire State Building, festooned with a gigantic red siren with a white slit of a cat's eye to terrify and drive New Yorkers into fear.
[1:21:12.800 --> 1:21:24.800]  The red scary lights of the police.
[1:21:24.800 --> 1:21:40.800]  And now, what is AP Reporting President Cuomo's new dream for those fretting over Biden? He's a hero.
[1:21:40.800 --> 1:21:49.800]  As he power grabs massively and lies about the president and Maddow says there's no hospital ship coming to New York. We have that video coming up later.
[1:21:49.800 --> 1:22:04.800]  She said last week there's no ship coming. There's no ship coming next week. Well, it's there, you lying witch.
[1:22:04.800 --> 1:22:09.800]  Let's talk to Dan in New York. Dan, you're on the air. What do you think about this?
[1:22:09.800 --> 1:22:21.800]  Cuomo is Satan. He's trying to hide his hooves and his split tongue every time. I've been living in New York under his tyranny for a long time now.
[1:22:21.800 --> 1:22:27.800]  You know, there's so much that I want to say, but you know, I've called you before and I told you about the 10 Planks to Communism.
[1:22:27.800 --> 1:22:34.800]  And now that they have a hold on rents, mortgages and they're working on tax liens as well.
[1:22:34.800 --> 1:22:39.800]  We're getting the final planks of the 10 Planks to the Communist Manifesto completed. Guys, please.
[1:22:39.800 --> 1:22:49.800]  Yes, exactly. And everyone, even even conservative minded people here in New York are happy about this rent suspension when it should be a rent renegotiation.
[1:22:49.800 --> 1:22:56.800]  What they're doing is the government is now saying they're the ones in control of eviction. So the landlord.
[1:22:56.800 --> 1:23:07.800]  And now they're going to nationalize everything. You're absolutely right. Trump is saying just give all these companies money. But but instead the Democrats want nationalization and that's what Cuomo is doing.
[1:23:07.800 --> 1:23:19.800]  Yeah. And the public advocate, I ran for public advocate. I called these people out and the public advocate on stage, Jimani Williams told me that he is implementing a licensing for landlord law.
[1:23:19.800 --> 1:23:29.800]  Okay, it's going to be there's going to be no more private property. People got to get ready for that right now. And the other thing is we're all sitting in our houses.
[1:23:29.800 --> 1:23:38.800]  And, you know, Cuomo, the tyrant over here is all of a sudden Thomas Jefferson. He's not going to confine us to the city, but he's got the subway running.
[1:23:38.800 --> 1:23:43.800]  Why the hell else does everyone think the thing's spreading so fast? It's spreading on the subway shut down the subway.
[1:23:43.800 --> 1:23:51.800]  And by the way, a lot of people, Dan, say, Hey, why does it say number four confiscate property owned by immigrants and rebels?
[1:23:51.800 --> 1:23:59.800]  That means seizing the property of conservatives, Christians, nationalists, patriots, gun owners. That's the censorship. That's the platforming that's taking your bank accounts.
[1:23:59.800 --> 1:24:05.800]  That's that's what they're doing to everybody. That's persecuting people that aren't part of your communist system.
[1:24:05.800 --> 1:24:15.800]  What about people that test positive for Corona and don't take mandatory antivirals or these vaccines that Bill and Melinda are going to be giving us?
[1:24:15.800 --> 1:24:23.800]  Well, notice how they don't want you to know about zinc. They don't want you to know about Z-Pak that kills the bacteria that are carrying it.
[1:24:23.800 --> 1:24:28.800]  And it, they're not telling you about hydroxychloroquine. That is the big crime. God bless you.
[1:24:28.800 --> 1:24:37.800]  And that's Cuomo last week said, I will arrest one night after the doctor was on entity who created three hundred patients. They all recovered.
[1:24:37.800 --> 1:24:42.800]  And he's doing clinical trials right now. It's cured over 600. That's in the news.
[1:24:42.800 --> 1:24:49.800]  He says, I will take your license or arrest you if you do that anymore. Well, checkmate, you just got to prove.
[1:24:49.800 --> 1:24:56.800]  So this up a rope, Cuomo, he wants fear. He wants people to collapse. He wants to be your savior, your daddy.
[1:24:56.800 --> 1:25:05.800]  Justin in Ohio. Thanks for holding. Say you're a lab scientist and virus and DNA modification. Give us your take, please.
[1:25:05.800 --> 1:25:18.800]  Yeah, hi. I, I guess my, I'll start off by saying this, but since 2006 of being in the polycellular biology, biological science field,
[1:25:18.800 --> 1:25:28.800]  it never ceases to amaze me that most of the time, not even doctors and of course not politicians will, will tell anyone about boosting your own immunity.
[1:25:28.800 --> 1:25:39.800]  That's something that even really before this took hold a few months back. It was just something that, you know, a few friends that I've either worked with previously or currently work with,
[1:25:39.800 --> 1:25:51.800]  including sales reps who sell certain pharmaceuticals and diagnostic kits that we produce to hospitals. It's just kind of a running joke as far as how,
[1:25:51.800 --> 1:26:01.800]  and you kind of alluded to this the other day as far as if a patent had expired, you know, there wasn't a lot of money to make as far as if a drug already exists on the market.
[1:26:01.800 --> 1:26:10.800]  So that's, that's, that's been a known thing. A known factor will call it in my field for what, you know, almost 15 years.
[1:26:10.800 --> 1:26:17.800]  But, oh yeah, take preglonone. It's been prescribed since the 20s for people with arthritis, you name it. But because it's so cheap,
[1:26:17.800 --> 1:26:29.800]  they don't even prescribe it anymore and it's over the counter and it's in our real red pill, red, real pill plus. I mean, again, that's how big pharma operates and they want to make money off the dangerous drugs they're developing
[1:26:29.800 --> 1:26:32.800]  and off the vaccine.
[1:26:32.800 --> 1:26:43.800]  I agree 100% and let me tell us real quick. I'm kind of a new listener. I have a little over two years now. This is the first time that I've ever called into any type of radio show or
[1:26:43.800 --> 1:26:53.800]  Justin, we're honored to have you explain to us your view on the virus. Is it man made? Is it DNA modification? We have a special guest joining us to GCP intentionally release COVID-19 next hour. Go ahead.
[1:26:53.800 --> 1:27:08.800]  I would defer to somebody that has a higher education and more experience. I'm 34 years old. You know, I defer to those that have spent much more time as far as in the industry.
[1:27:08.800 --> 1:27:26.800]  I just thought it said virus DNA modification. What's your what? So what I was, what I was kind of getting at was, so I was a first generation biotechnology student, Ohio University, the wonderful Athens, Ohio that you guys had the little incident with recently.
[1:27:26.800 --> 1:27:44.800]  And I would say that from being the first group of biotech students, there was a secret. We still, to this day, a couple of us have researched. We still can't find any real leads as far as who knew or who knew what was involved.
[1:27:44.800 --> 1:28:01.800]  But we had a small pig cloning factory right outside our laboratory. I should call it not a factory, but right outside of Athens, Ohio, we know that Ohio University and Hawking College had some type of, you know, commitment to this small facility.
[1:28:01.800 --> 1:28:23.800]  But, but, you know, this goes all the way back to pre 2006 that we were genetically messing with with splicing different just a whole host of different things into the cell lines of not only pigs, but rabbits, monkeys, mice, humans.
[1:28:23.800 --> 1:28:26.800]  And of course, these are any other cross species.
[1:28:26.800 --> 1:28:37.800]  Yeah. Yeah. But not on, you know, people like to get carried away. They think, oh, if you say pig cloning, they think the entire animal know these are specific cells. These are either liver cells, kidney cells, brain tissue.
[1:28:37.800 --> 1:28:51.800]  Sure. Okay. Stay right there. We're going to talk about this just when we come back. Yeah. Cloning is totally industrialized now. It's everywhere. I mean, again, 30 years ago, they had animal human hybrids in their reports in China.
[1:28:51.800 --> 1:28:55.800]  Now, do they bring them to full birth? Who knows? We'll be right back.
[1:28:55.800 --> 1:29:05.800]  Get healthy, not high with 100% pure CBD, powerful natural pain relief from veterans vitality. GCN listeners, have you ever thought about how CBD may help you?

[1:29:55.800 --> 1:30:08.800]  There is a paradox. Yes, this virus is deadly and does kill people. And so do many other countless viruses that have already existed that do exist and will exist.
[1:30:08.800 --> 1:30:19.800]  But when Trump says the cure is worse than disease, he's talking about the media hype, creating hysteria and trying to create uncertainty.
[1:30:19.800 --> 1:30:41.800]  And it is that that I oppose. It is not the American way to cower and live in fear and to follow the edicts and precedents set by communist China and hyper authoritarian Singapore, where you're now being given six months in jail if you don't stand at least six feet away from someone.
[1:30:41.800 --> 1:30:56.800]  This is being used by social engineers and they admit that they are trying to transform our world forever into something unrecognizable from what it's been. We are not slaves and we must not act like it.
[1:30:56.800 --> 1:31:15.800]  My mind for more than eight weeks has been fixed, constantly scanning, constantly computing to understand the strategic attack we're witnessing. We know by the scripting and the choreography and the fact that the virus has been scanned that it's man made and an attack on our economy.
[1:31:15.800 --> 1:31:33.800]  The globalist media is firmly behind this devastating the United States and driving Trump from power. But now we know from scores of studies from China, the UK, the United States, Europe, Brazil, Japan that the virus reinfects and attacks different parts of the body.
[1:31:33.800 --> 1:31:52.800]  That, ladies and gentlemen, is an engineered bio weapon just as the Indian scientists eight weeks ago conclusively proved their major university. They have a name for it at the time of God. It's called a soft kill weapon. It doesn't kill you usually the first time, but the next time, the third time or the fourth, it does.
[1:31:52.800 --> 1:32:03.800]  And it weighs down your economy in the process.
[1:32:22.800 --> 1:32:33.800]  Metamins, amino acids and extracts used for hundreds of years across the world to provide focus, clarity and a boost of energy when you need it.

[1:33:33.800 --> 1:33:49.800]  Well, I intended to give each caller about a minute and a half. But this last caller, Justin Ohio, is talking about back in the early 2000s, 15 years ago or so.
[1:33:49.800 --> 1:34:06.800]  Secret farms involved in pig cloning. You've got whole pigs getting cloned and dogs, cats, horses. But we're talking about cloning the cells in the body. And there's all sorts of other things that go on.
[1:34:06.800 --> 1:34:12.800]  And that can allow viruses and other things to jump between species. I mean, there's just all sorts of problems that come out of this.
[1:34:12.800 --> 1:34:20.800]  And then it's these very industries that are always telling us we need to take force vaccines that have liability protection so they can't get in trouble for any side effects.
[1:34:20.800 --> 1:34:27.800]  Or the main effects that's really meant to have the Trojan horse sterilization is usually what they're trying and these vaccines are always getting caught doing it.
[1:34:27.800 --> 1:34:42.800]  Now COVID-19 and big studies is eating men's genitals, destroying them, bloody pulps, lacerations. Most men are infertile after they get a serious case of it. It's why you need to have zinc. You need to have sunshine. You need to be healthy.
[1:34:42.800 --> 1:34:53.800]  That's how you beat it. They don't want you knowing that. Don't have zinc and die, folks. But again, they don't want the president even talking about a drug that forces zinc into the cells.
[1:34:53.800 --> 1:35:00.800]  We'll finish up with this caller and what he was breaking down and then you can tell he's never called into a show. He's saying he's spilling some pretty big beans there.
[1:35:00.800 --> 1:35:07.800]  I know about the secret cloning programs all over the country. I mean, you can actually get into research papers and find out where they're going on.
[1:35:07.800 --> 1:35:15.800]  Let's just say it's not widely publicized and a big part of universities is having students part of secret things. That's how they seduce them.
[1:35:15.800 --> 1:35:32.800]  I've told the story about my dad in high school, was in Planned Tube by the time he was a sophomore and then a junior and a senior. He was at UT most of the time, not in East Texas at his little school.
[1:35:32.800 --> 1:35:42.800]  And he'd been there about a year and they said, let's show you the secret nuclear reactor under UT. Now that's still very hard to find in literature. It's under there. Shut down.
[1:35:42.800 --> 1:35:51.800]  One of the biggest research ones in the world for a research reactor at the JJ Pickles Center in North Austin.
[1:35:51.800 --> 1:35:58.800]  And I have Austinites sometimes walk up and say, there's no nuclear reactors in Austin because they live in fantasy land.
[1:35:58.800 --> 1:36:06.800]  So that's how the seduction works into the scientific tyranny is your gib and the knowledge of the Manhattan Project stuff going on.
[1:36:06.800 --> 1:36:15.800]  And if you prove you go along with it long enough, you get led into the inner sanctum. And that's why you see all this in movies and TV preparing you and conditioning you show up.
[1:36:15.800 --> 1:36:22.800]  Interesting points. What else do you want to tell folks about some of the secret stuff? How do they tell you it was secret or how did you learn about it?
[1:36:22.800 --> 1:36:44.800]  So my the professor, which so being a first generation biotech student, so it was essentially two people that were the the heads of the entire program. The curriculum was developed by a at the time a small pathogen laboratory that is located right in Athens.
[1:36:44.800 --> 1:36:53.800]  It's since then been bought out by a larger corporation. But anyhow, we had because of these two people that were in charge of everything.
[1:36:53.800 --> 1:37:01.800]  One was a Ethiopian and the other was an American and they both gave me different information at different times.
[1:37:01.800 --> 1:37:16.800]  And it really wasn't anything that you had to piece together because they kind of they ran over as far as you know what each other had said. And I just knew at that time and given at that time I was a 19 year old 18 year old when I first got in that.
[1:37:16.800 --> 1:37:31.800]  And it was, you know, honestly, you just you don't dream that all the the possibilities you don't dream of all the possibilities of this work. It's just like an interesting thing that's at your fingertips.
[1:37:31.800 --> 1:37:43.800]  But but now in hindsight, I mean, obviously, you were probably doing pretty good. They probably like to you seem promising and they were testing because imagine you're at the ground floor of this and they're already showing you and telling you about secret facilities,
[1:37:43.800 --> 1:37:47.800]  secret cloning. Can you imagine how deep the rabbit hole goes?
[1:37:47.800 --> 1:37:52.800]  Right. No, I honestly know I can't. I can't.
[1:37:52.800 --> 1:38:07.800]  Just because, you know, who knows how many stones, you know, unturned who knows. But a couple things I just wanted to throw out real quick. So I made after this or besides college, I actually went to work for that company before they had been bought out.
[1:38:07.800 --> 1:38:28.800]  And they my job was to inoculate the million cell lines that I had named off a minute ago to inoculate those cell lines with nine major or the nine major respiratory viruses, which include herpes simplex, different types of influenza RSV, which is extremely, you know, fatal to
[1:38:28.800 --> 1:38:46.800]  children, infants. So so anyhow, I inoculated these cell lines with all these different viruses and I would feed them weekly and I would do a bunch of cell staining and a whole bunch of whole bunch of different techniques and assays to see how promising certain
[1:38:46.800 --> 1:38:52.800]  drugs were. So this kind of again, were these were these live virus inoculations.
[1:38:52.800 --> 1:39:06.800]  Yep. Live live viruses, which again continually leaks and continually drifts genetically. I mean, and you're a scientist, I've just read the reports, but so many of the problems come out of these live inoculations and then also cause mutations.
[1:39:06.800 --> 1:39:08.800]  Don't they?
[1:39:08.800 --> 1:39:25.800]  That is, I mean, it's amazing how easy, well, I shouldn't say for all viruses, but for specific ones, how easily mutated they can be. I mean, it's, again, I'm not I don't have a PhD in this. I mean, it's just something that you know it's my undergrad and something that I've I've done professionally
[1:39:25.800 --> 1:39:43.800]  now for over a decade. But so so that's why I try not to form these full conclusions in my head because I know that I don't know, you know, who knows what percentage of the truth. But hey brother, my dad was an oral surgeon and he was doing some of the first big implants in the early
[1:39:43.800 --> 1:39:55.800]  2000s and it wasn't like it was something special because he had that background and some, you know, UT projects and science projects kind of was getting asked and stuff. He they tried to recruit him for us to move to Maryland.
[1:39:55.800 --> 1:40:10.800]  He paid $450,000 a year back then that's like $2 million today. And they were and when he didn't take the job they recruited a bunch of other oral surgeons he knew that went into an underground base in Maryland to do secret cyborg work
[1:40:10.800 --> 1:40:20.800]  with humans by dad was told so these they have military people volunteering who the hell knows what's going on. That was like 1983 brother.
[1:40:20.800 --> 1:40:25.800]  Can you imagine the secret thing right under the surface.
[1:40:25.800 --> 1:40:43.800]  No, I mean, no, honestly, I can't. I also did real quick four years in the in the army. It ended up being most of the time was as a reservist. But but anyhow just seeing her just cracking the book on the UCMJ.
[1:40:43.800 --> 1:40:53.800]  And based on the countless briefings that we were in there just seems there are so many things that the public is just 100% blind to and even if you
[1:40:53.800 --> 1:41:00.800]  Well, here's an example they do experimental drug tests and vaccine tests on troops. Yes. Yes.
[1:41:00.800 --> 1:41:09.800]  And it's illegal you can order troops to do anything under the law. You do have a lot of your rights but you can't make them take experimental drugs and vaccines.
[1:41:09.800 --> 1:41:12.800]  But they do it.
[1:41:12.800 --> 1:41:29.800]  From my account, they they look at you as whenever they have these third party clinicians and everybody come in they look at you as you are such bottom of the of the pond scum that they I mean I don't honestly I have no clue and this is the same with about everybody
[1:41:29.800 --> 1:41:42.800]  Well, you just said the scientific elite is the most eugenics based anti human arrogant scum. But if you're top of your class and are smart, they tell you you're the elite. We've got to control population. We've got to wipe everybody out.
[1:41:42.800 --> 1:41:55.800]  And then if you accept that you get brought into the cult. And so I'm just glad you're letting folks know that just from your, you know, right at the bottom level of the science what you saw in the army and the university.
[1:41:55.800 --> 1:41:56.800]  Yeah.
[1:41:56.800 --> 1:42:09.800]  Can I get like 20 seconds real quick. Yeah, go ahead sir. Okay, so I was ranting and raving, not really publicly but on the inside, as far as whenever the whole thing with oh you happen with Caitlin.
[1:42:09.800 --> 1:42:19.800]  And so anyway, I just wanted to make clear and this is some so I'm from the connecting counties right along the Ohio River border in West Virginia mag mags and galley counties.
[1:42:19.800 --> 1:42:34.800]  When the when the when the university a few weeks ago attacked Caitlin Bennett. Yes. Yeah. And so I have so disgusted because I, I've seen things and the new of things, you know, way before this incident.
[1:42:34.800 --> 1:42:43.800]  And I just wanted to tell everybody out there that you get into Appalachia, especially Western West Virginia Southeast Ohio.
[1:42:43.800 --> 1:42:52.800]  We are the complete opposite of anything you see on on any of those videos from that campus. It has been a no brother. I know it. I understand the campuses are nest of evil.
[1:42:52.800 --> 1:42:55.800]  We're going to get your name and number buddy. I want to get you on as a guest. God bless you.

They're going to crush Fox News and Paul kind of combined 200 people I talked to in one article but it's just a very, very important thing that's going on a very,
[1:47:49.800 --> 1:48:04.800]  very important thing that is unfolding. How big the stakes are they already took over the right and that's that's well known. They used operatives to go in. They were going to basically indict people unless they just shut down their news operations.

[1:49:12.800 --> 1:49:21.800]  Okay, let's go to Mike in Missouri who is a postal worker on the virus. Thanks for calling.
[1:49:21.800 --> 1:49:30.800]  Thanks. I first I like to show it's hard to find good news on the, you know, everything's a lie on TV. Anyway, you can't believe half of it.
[1:49:30.800 --> 1:49:37.800]  I just say more, more than half of it's a lie. I mean, yeah, it's coming out of a Democrat's mouth. It's about 90% of the time a lie.
[1:49:37.800 --> 1:49:45.800]  Yeah, it's it's weird really. But I was just calling because I just wanted to say don't forget about the mailman. You know, they used anthrax in the mail.
[1:49:45.800 --> 1:49:54.800]  I wouldn't, I wouldn't be surprised if they tried to spread it around through there and we are never allowed to take work off. I mean, that's just the mail doesn't stop because
[1:49:54.800 --> 1:49:59.800]  And I've seen these reports that they're saying about mid summer the Postal Service will go bankrupt. What's that about?
[1:49:59.800 --> 1:50:11.800]  Well, they they they cut the shipping cost out because the Amazon kind of took over and then everybody buys everything online and you have this free shipping and then the business just takes it out of their own pocket.
[1:50:11.800 --> 1:50:22.800]  And so we can't ever ever get any revenue to offset our the cost that we take, you know, the trucks and the and that's because you're not selling the products yourself very limited products.
[1:50:22.800 --> 1:50:29.800]  And what Amazon does is it does what Walmart does. It makes you sell to them for less or you don't get the market.
[1:50:29.800 --> 1:50:39.800]  And then it basically puts all everybody out of business. That's why Amazon now is going into manufacturing. So they'll control the manufacturing, they'll control the shipping, they'll control everything.
[1:50:39.800 --> 1:50:52.800]  Yeah, they basically trying to wipe the stamp out, which, you know, and that's just what I wanted to say is this show is kind of what opened my eyes to a lot of things and I learned about the fact that, you know, post office kind of started a lot of the
[1:50:52.800 --> 1:50:59.800]  American post and ties into the army and all these conspiracies that are actually truth because they hide it from us.
[1:50:59.800 --> 1:51:14.800]  And I just want to say thanks for your show because you, you know, you guys talk about that stuff and they don't talk about that on the news. They talk about community and, and, you know, blood drive stuff that, you know, you can't really take as serious.
[1:51:14.800 --> 1:51:20.800]  And when there's actual serious stuff out there, it's hard to find a good news source. So I just appreciate that.
[1:51:20.800 --> 1:51:29.800]  God bless you, sir. We're all in this together. And again, people say, Oh, we need to nationalize everything or we need to privatize everything or we need to have private companies doing it.
[1:51:29.800 --> 1:51:36.800]  These private companies act like authoritarian governments. They work with authoritarian governments and they're trying to create an authoritarian system.
[1:51:36.800 --> 1:51:45.800]  Google's bigger than the post office ever was Apple, all of them. And they're working in concert to create monopolies, spy on us, work with dictatorships and screw us over.
[1:51:45.800 --> 1:51:51.800]  We need the counterbalance of the post office. Absolutely. God bless you. I appreciate your call.
[1:51:51.800 --> 1:52:02.800]  There is a corporate move to destroy the nation state and they take libertarian ideas to the extreme that might work in some far off utopian system once we defeat all this tyranny.
[1:52:02.800 --> 1:52:08.800]  But right now they're using libertarian ideas to open the borders. Libertarian ideas to let big corporations undercut everybody.
[1:52:08.800 --> 1:52:19.800]  It's not being done in a free market. It's being done artificially using communist China as the engine to create the slave goods that no one can compete with because we're under all these governmental regulations and they aren't.
[1:52:19.800 --> 1:52:27.800]  You'd call that libertarian, but it's really communist because it's called slavery. It's all been set up to tie us down so that we can't operate.
[1:52:27.800 --> 1:52:30.800]  So we've got to blast our way out of this politically.
[1:52:30.800 --> 1:52:38.800]  All right, let's go now to TJ in Europe on curfews lockdowns of the virus. Yeah, Europe's even more locked down than we are.
[1:52:38.800 --> 1:52:44.800]  Unless you're an Islamic invader, then you're free to do whatever you want. Come across the border, fly in, burn things down, rape women.
[1:52:44.800 --> 1:52:53.800]  The judges actually say in Sweden and in places like Denmark, it's part of their culture to rape nine-year-old girls. You're on the air. Go ahead.
[1:52:53.800 --> 1:53:05.800]  Yes, Alex, a long time listener, first time caller, an American here in Europe now stranded because they closed the airports.
[1:53:05.800 --> 1:53:15.800]  I'm not worried about that. I'm actually worried about my country right now listening to you. You're my lifeline right now to the states, but I'm worried about everybody right now.
[1:53:15.800 --> 1:53:24.800]  I have an old shirt from you on the front that says Bill of Rights and on the back caller, it says apathy is treason. That is true right now.
[1:53:24.800 --> 1:53:32.800]  We're being too apathetic with everything we're doing and we need to wake up and see what's going on in front of us.
[1:53:32.800 --> 1:53:43.800]  Here, I can tell you that they have already implemented a weekend curfew from 4 p.m. till 5 a.m. the next day.
[1:53:43.800 --> 1:53:53.800]  We've been basically ahead of you guys with all the curfews going into the grocery shortage and now spraying you with some disinfectant here.
[1:53:53.800 --> 1:54:01.800]  There's lines, everything, and it's just going to get worse. In America, we need to wake up. They're coming for everything.
[1:54:01.800 --> 1:54:15.800]  I was in the airports right before they closed everything. No credit cards, all cash, everything was very new scanning machines, everything.
[1:54:15.800 --> 1:54:19.800]  You mean no credit cards?
[1:54:19.800 --> 1:54:21.800]  Only credit cards.
[1:54:21.800 --> 1:54:32.800]  Alex, I come from a time prior to 9-11. I remember when you used to be able to walk onto the plane before GSA. This is all coming out now right in front of me.
[1:54:32.800 --> 1:54:41.800]  You can see this all new security, new kind of scanning things just now being installed into these airports.
[1:54:41.800 --> 1:54:47.800]  That's right. It was all pre-positioned, all pre-planned, and it's being rolled out in phases.
[1:54:47.800 --> 1:54:55.800]  According to the Chinese Communist Big Tech Model, they designed it, really, Silicon Valley did, and then it rolls out in increments via MIT, was heavily involved,
[1:54:55.800 --> 1:55:06.800]  and it's digital tattoos, it's microchips, it's force inoculations, it's curfews, and then as they just keep ratcheting, ratcheting, ratcheting up incrementally so that we accept it.
[1:55:06.800 --> 1:55:09.800]  You're absolutely right. Anything else?
[1:55:09.800 --> 1:55:21.800]  No, you're just doing a great job, Alex. God bless you, and this is for the Infra Warriors out there. Everybody just keep together and keep that compassion alive,
[1:55:21.800 --> 1:55:28.800]  and have love for one another. I think that's most important right now, and I hope for everybody.
[1:55:28.800 --> 1:55:35.800]  Thank you so much, DJ. We're going to go to Elvis before we end this hour, and we'll continue with calls and have a special guest.
[1:55:35.800 --> 1:55:43.800]  The virus is real, but the response is something we've never done before, and it is about the globalist takeover, and the Rockefeller Foundation admits that.
[1:55:43.800 --> 1:55:51.800]  And we know that it's man-made, and we know that Gigi Pink's fingerprints are all over at the shutdown, the rebellion he had, and then to be exported here.
[1:55:51.800 --> 1:55:55.800]  And we'll cover that next hour with a special investigative journalist joining us who gets into that.
[1:55:55.800 --> 1:55:59.800]  But let's go to Elvis in New York. Thank you, Elvis. You're on the air.
[1:55:59.800 --> 1:56:08.800]  Hey, God bless, Alex, and God bless your family and everything you do. I wanted to touch this topic real quick, because this is something I feel like nobody's putting out, and it's crucial.
[1:56:08.800 --> 1:56:14.800]  Are you familiar with a thing called Event 201 that just happened in October?
[1:56:14.800 --> 1:56:24.800]  Yes. October, November, the billable indicates that a deal over 65 million died from a coronavirus, and he had all these TV shows ready to come out about the coronavirus, and it's all scripted, all prepared.
[1:56:24.800 --> 1:56:32.800]  Correct, correct. So this is the thing, right? What was the main thing that Trump was running on? It was an economy.
[1:56:32.800 --> 1:56:33.800]  Yes.
[1:56:33.800 --> 1:56:47.800]  And then it's funny, because the main topic on this was how it would diminish large-scale economic and societal consequences, you know, to figure out how it would affect society and the economy.
[1:56:47.800 --> 1:56:59.800]  Now, what I'm seeing is, because I live in New York, but I'm from Puerto Rico, and since I've been very awake to the whole thing, somehow God gave me this third eye. I just seen it.
[1:56:59.800 --> 1:57:12.800]  And it's funny, because you have this idea of a pandemic, and yet it's more of a control, but there's no disease around. Now, is corona real? Of course.
[1:57:12.800 --> 1:57:17.800]  And then when you don't see all the disease, they go, we saved you by doing it. It's all perfectly scripted.
[1:57:17.800 --> 1:57:22.800]  Yes, correct. And what I'm seeing for rolling out in almost synchrony...
[1:57:22.800 --> 1:57:30.800]  Hold on, Elvis, don't leave the building. I'm going to go to break. I'm right back to Elvis. I've got to give Elvis more time. And that's a cool name.
[1:57:30.800 --> 1:57:37.800]  And then we've got... But Elvis gets a lot of ladies. And we're going to talk to Rob and Louisiana and so many more.
[1:57:37.800 --> 1:57:44.800]  Third hour straight ahead. Remember, the power that people have is to spread the word about this transmission. The globalists can't stand it.
[1:57:44.800 --> 1:57:52.800]  One of our best-selling products is Living Defense, and it's been sold out for over four months because it's hard to source the ingredients that are organic.
[1:57:52.800 --> 1:57:58.800]  We've got a limited supply right now, but it's selling out fast. And I want those of you that haven't experienced Living Defense to get it for yourself.
[1:57:58.800 --> 1:58:00.800]  Here's just part of one testimonial.
[1:58:00.800 --> 1:58:07.800]  Look, in January 2016, I went in a hospital. I went in the VA hospital out here in Boyce, and I was in there until June.
[1:58:07.800 --> 1:58:16.800]  And one of the only things that got me through that ordeal was listening to Info Wars three hours a day, and I kept hearing Dr. Group and all you guys talking about Living Defense.
[1:58:16.800 --> 1:58:22.800]  Let me tell you something, man. I had an internal digestive problem, and I stumbled with it for about five or six years.
[1:58:22.800 --> 1:58:25.800]  And the doctors, they tried every test. Nobody could figure out what it is.
[1:58:25.800 --> 1:58:31.800]  And then every day, when I kept hearing you and Dr. Group and those commercials, I said, you know what? I'm going to get me some of that freaking Living Defense.
[1:58:31.800 --> 1:58:34.800]  Now, I wasn't supposed to have any nutritionals because they don't want you to have that stuff.
[1:58:34.800 --> 1:58:42.800]  But I ordered it, had it shipped to me. I got it. I hid it from the nurses. I started taking it, man. That stuff changed my life. It saved my life.
[1:58:42.800 --> 1:58:46.800]  Alex Jones and Info Wars saved my life.
[1:58:46.800 --> 1:58:58.800]  One of the products that I'm very proud of, I don't talk enough about, because there's so many amazing essential oils and ingredients in it, it takes a long time to break down the product because it's a complex product.
[1:58:58.800 --> 1:59:07.800]  A lot of the sprays you put in your mouth, your throat, and lungs are really thin. It's a little bit of alcohol if you want it to essential oils.
[1:59:07.800 --> 1:59:26.800]  Not our lung cleanse. It's got a long list of the highest quality essential oils and ingredients in it. You take a few sprays in your mouth, lightly inhale, and it just does so much for me when I've got allergies or when my throat is tired.
[1:59:26.800 --> 1:59:34.800]  It's just very, very soothing. And it's just one more thing for you and your family to have in your arsenal during these insane times.
[1:59:34.800 --> 1:59:46.800]  Get your lung cleanse discounted at infowarstore.com and get yourself and your family prepared while at the same time funding the Info War, a total 360 win, infowarstore.com.
[2:00:04.800 --> 2:00:24.800]  Now I close my eyes, and I wonder why I don't despise. Now all I can do, love was warm, so light you do.
[2:00:24.800 --> 2:00:36.800]  We are Back Live. We are Broadcasting Worldwide. I am your host. And we're talking to Elvis in New York about Event 201, the Bill and Melinda Gates operation last fall-winter,
[2:00:36.800 --> 2:00:40.800]  drilling with the coronavirus, killing 65 million people, and the Rockefeller Foundation.
[2:00:40.800 --> 2:00:49.800]  A lot stepped ten years ago about worldwide tyranny being brought in via a bio-weapon release or via a pathogen. So please continue, Elvis, with your points.
[2:00:49.800 --> 2:01:01.800]  Yes, yes. So the first case in China that we know of was in November 17 of last year. So the event started one month prior, and then we have this happen.
[2:01:01.800 --> 2:01:12.800]  Now the last time I can remember something similar, very similar was in September of 2001. We have an operation. We have everything, everybody is told that it's just practice.
[2:01:12.800 --> 2:01:22.800]  And just like every other FF, we come around, and what do we have? A month later, suddenly it starts. And where does it start?
[2:01:22.800 --> 2:01:36.800]  We've been having the whole time between China and U.S., an economic war. And what was the event based on in October, exactly on how it would diminish the economy and societal consequences of it?
[2:01:36.800 --> 2:01:50.800]  So see what I'm seeing right now is Agenda 21 being rolled out in the red carpet and put right into the direction of destroying the economy, then bringing fear into society and seeing how we cope.
[2:01:50.800 --> 2:01:59.800]  And once they see exactly like I mentioned earlier, once we cope, then they start picking out, okay, who's worthy? Who's not worthy? Who can come out? Who cannot come out?
[2:01:59.800 --> 2:02:09.800]  I see a similar system in North Korea right now, almost similar. You know, if you're valuable to the system in place, you get a nice condo, you get nice treatment.
[2:02:09.800 --> 2:02:24.800]  And the lower you are in the total, the farther out you get pushed into the bis and pretty much forgotten. The middle class, the whole purpose of the system right now was to destroy, but what kills me is that we have a present place who obviously has been working hard.
[2:02:24.800 --> 2:02:37.800]  But why does he bring it to the public? Why does he's being heard right now? I think it's crucial that he should bring it to just the idea. I know it's hard because the media, but the media is already doing desperate stuff.
[2:02:37.800 --> 2:02:53.800]  They're in the last legs is dragging. Why don't you bring awareness to the fact of these false operations in the past? Why don't you work people up to the fact that, listen, your government is a conglomerate of different entities and different groups and different families and different
[2:02:53.800 --> 2:03:04.800]  every day. It's not one body. It's not one body. It's not just here, one body working. No, this is a body where the arm has canned greens and the foot has candida.
[2:03:04.800 --> 2:03:17.800]  You know, and we need to start really bringing it out because I believe he's getting himself in a position where one day when he's already planned, they're going to cut the communications pretty soon.
[2:03:17.800 --> 2:03:27.800]  And we're going to leave everybody angry at him. And the voice is not going to get out far enough. They couldn't do it through impeachment. I believe this is leading to a coup.
[2:03:27.800 --> 2:03:35.800]  Oh, absolutely. This is the groundwork for the coup. And Trump is trying to ride the tiger right now, and they're trying to shut us down as well.
[2:03:35.800 --> 2:03:47.800]  I mean, I was just reading earlier this New Yorker article. I got one of the top, you know, FDA lawyers, Jonathan Emore, and we never made the claims. They said we made falsely about toothpaste and stuff.
[2:03:47.800 --> 2:03:56.800]  And it's toothpaste we sell as tooth-winding toothpaste. And I said to the lawyer, I said, yeah, we've complied with what they said. We need to say what they said. He talked to the head lady there.
[2:03:56.800 --> 2:04:03.800]  Well, then here's the Attorney General of New York saying, Jones hasn't complied. He's still selling it. Well, the actual letter didn't say stop selling it.
[2:04:03.800 --> 2:04:09.800]  We don't say it's a cure. We never even said that. I told the lawyer, I said, this is different than any case you've seen. I said, you watch.
[2:04:09.800 --> 2:04:19.800]  The Attorney General of New York will say that I kept selling it when she ordered me to stop in a tweet. But the actual letter just said, hey, if you are making these claims, don't make them.
[2:04:19.800 --> 2:04:24.800]  They didn't say stop selling it. It's tooth whitening toothpaste designed by a dentist.
[2:04:24.800 --> 2:04:36.800]  So that's what's so crazy about all this is that just everything is how the left now is absolutely out to get anybody that doesn't submit to them.
[2:04:36.800 --> 2:04:43.800]  And it's very, very scary. And New York is this thing with tentacles flashing out of the country, just like LA and just like D.C.
[2:04:43.800 --> 2:04:54.800]  But the people in the cities, Elvis, are great folks. Elvis has left the building. We'll be back with special guests and more calls. Stay with us.
[2:05:13.800 --> 2:05:23.800]  Alex Jones and Info Wars have been sounding the alarm for patriots worldwide, waking people up to the new world order.
[2:05:23.800 --> 2:05:38.800]  Bohemian Grove, the American deep state, the rise of communist China, the plan for global depopulation, and global elite pedophiles who pray off of our young.
[2:05:38.800 --> 2:05:50.800]  The enemy has done their best to destroy us. But because of your support, our fight continues. Join us, support the Info War, and together we will slay the dragon.
[2:05:50.800 --> 2:05:53.800]  Keep fighting, Alex. You're the gladiator.
[2:05:53.800 --> 2:06:18.800]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic. It's Alex Jones.
[2:06:18.800 --> 2:06:30.800]  Well, Jeff Nyquist is going to be with us here in this hour. J.R. Jeff Nyquist is author of Origins of the Fourth World War, The Fool, and His Enemy, and the new tactics of global war.
[2:06:30.800 --> 2:06:37.800]  He has been a columnist for WorldNet Daily, Sierra Times, Financial Sense Online. His writing was also published by The Epic Times.
[2:06:37.800 --> 2:06:55.800]  J.R. Nyquist.blog and J.R. Nyquist.com. And here are the articles that he breaks down. Did Xi Jinping launch and intentionally release the COVID-19 virus and other key reports?
[2:06:55.800 --> 2:07:05.800]  The secret speech of General Chai Ho-Tan, if I pronounce it right, and more. He wants to get a COVID-19 and did Xi Jinping intentionally launch it.
[2:07:05.800 --> 2:07:18.800]  Jeff, good to have you here with us. I'm going to try to let you have the floor and the rest of the segment to lay out what you currently think is behind all this, where you think it's going, the job you think Trump's doing, and then let's get into the Chinese globalist doctrine
[2:07:18.800 --> 2:07:23.800]  and how they've openly said they only kind of would actually benefit from a nuclear war.
[2:07:23.800 --> 2:07:37.800]  Yes. I think that when this outbreak first happened, I expected, and I was on your show in February, I thought that it was an accidental release from the Wuhan lab.
[2:07:37.800 --> 2:07:47.800]  But now, after analyzing all of the different data points, it seems to me that this release may have been intentional and I'm going to lay out my reasoning.
[2:07:47.800 --> 2:07:58.800]  About Chai Ho-Tan, that Chinese General, former Defense Minister, I have put his secret speech from about 17 years ago on my website.
[2:07:58.800 --> 2:08:05.800]  It was translated by Epoch Times in around 2005. They published it at the time.
[2:08:05.800 --> 2:08:15.800]  It's a speech about using biological weapons on the United States, about China's emphasis on biological warfare, and about China's Liebensraum problem.
[2:08:15.800 --> 2:08:25.800]  China's overpopulation problem. Now, if we analyze this outbreak, this pandemic, there's a number of points that are interesting.
[2:08:25.800 --> 2:08:34.800]  The first one is China has had a one-child policy for half a century in which they now have a bubble of elderly to take care of,
[2:08:34.800 --> 2:08:40.800]  because when you do that for a long period of time, you have now obviously that people didn't follow their rules
[2:08:40.800 --> 2:08:45.800]  because their population has grown 40% instead of growing by more than double in the last 50 years.
[2:08:45.800 --> 2:08:50.800]  But they have a large bubble of elderly population to take care of.
[2:08:50.800 --> 2:08:58.800]  And the one thing about this virus is it targets the elderly and the infirm, which in a socialist state system like China,
[2:08:58.800 --> 2:09:09.800]  where they take care of the elderly through the state budget, this is a tremendous way to getting rid of a lot of elderly people that they won't have to take care of.
[2:09:09.800 --> 2:09:18.800]  And you've probably seen some of the reports on Twitter out of China about elderly people being put in body bags and cremated while they're still alive.
[2:09:18.800 --> 2:09:23.800]  These terrifying stories are still circulating out of China.
[2:09:23.800 --> 2:09:27.800]  Then we have to look at the timing of the release of this virus.
[2:09:27.800 --> 2:09:36.800]  It happened right after President Trump had begun this tariff war and had backed China into a corner on the trade talks and China had to give in.
[2:09:36.800 --> 2:09:44.800]  So China gives in in the trade talks and bam, this virus is released and it's almost like a strike back at our market system.
[2:09:44.800 --> 2:09:46.800]  Look at what was happening.
[2:09:46.800 --> 2:09:50.800]  Trump had a great economy, things were going very good, all of a sudden the market crashes.
[2:09:50.800 --> 2:09:55.800]  We're heading up towards 30% unemployment.
[2:09:55.800 --> 2:10:01.800]  Then another point, I talked to a friend who teaches in a college in the Midwest in Chicago.
[2:10:01.800 --> 2:10:10.800]  He told me that in his school, it's an art school, art college, there's a lot of Chinese students and they're from elite communist families.
[2:10:10.800 --> 2:10:17.800]  He mentioned to me in January that a lot of those families, their students were going home in the fall.
[2:10:17.800 --> 2:10:21.800]  He said by the end of the spring term, they were all going to be gone.
[2:10:21.800 --> 2:10:24.800]  They weren't going to have any Chinese students next year.
[2:10:24.800 --> 2:10:27.800]  That's a very interesting data point.
[2:10:27.800 --> 2:10:36.800]  As if somebody in the Communist Party back in China, leading families, knew, all right, get your kids out of America,
[2:10:36.800 --> 2:10:39.800]  then there's a provocation in Hong Kong.
[2:10:39.800 --> 2:10:46.800]  We had in the late summer, early fall, these independence movement in Hong Kong,
[2:10:46.800 --> 2:10:54.800]  which appears to be a provocation because many of the leaders of that movement have had contacts with Beijing, which were very suspicious.
[2:10:54.800 --> 2:11:04.800]  Now it turns out that thousands of Chinese anti-CCP, anti-communists are missing in China, thousands of them.
[2:11:04.800 --> 2:11:10.800]  There is this story out of Hong Kong that China deployed 400 secret police agents in the fall.
[2:11:10.800 --> 2:11:17.800]  They started hunting, kidnapping and murdering anti-communist activists in Hong Kong.
[2:11:17.800 --> 2:11:26.800]  And then you see this testimony from the, I don't know if you saw it last month, our STRATCOM commander gave testimony before Congress
[2:11:26.800 --> 2:11:31.800]  in which he said we are facing the end of the shelf life of our nuclear deterrent
[2:11:31.800 --> 2:11:39.800]  and that we must invest enormous amounts of money to maintain our nuclear deterrent in the next few years.
[2:11:39.800 --> 2:11:41.800]  Otherwise we're going to lose our deterrent.
[2:11:41.800 --> 2:11:44.800]  And his testimony was really interesting.
[2:11:44.800 --> 2:11:50.800]  So this attack coincides in a moment when our nuclear deterrent has aged its past its shelf life.
[2:11:50.800 --> 2:11:57.800]  We have to make a large investment to maintain it and now our markets collapse, our revenues collapse.
[2:11:57.800 --> 2:12:00.800]  Do we have the money to maintain our nuclear deterrent?
[2:12:00.800 --> 2:12:05.800]  These are all data points which I'm watching and there's others that are very alarming
[2:12:05.800 --> 2:12:14.800]  that suggest the Chinese government, Xi Jinping, knew exactly what he was doing.
[2:12:14.800 --> 2:12:15.800]  I'm listening to you.
[2:12:15.800 --> 2:12:16.800]  I've been reading your articles.
[2:12:16.800 --> 2:12:18.800]  They're dead on because I'm researching the same stuff.
[2:12:18.800 --> 2:12:21.800]  I mean, it's clearly all pre-programmed, prepared.
[2:12:21.800 --> 2:12:22.800]  The Chinese students go home.
[2:12:22.800 --> 2:12:23.800]  They use this against Taiwan.
[2:12:23.800 --> 2:12:25.800]  They use it against their domestic groups.
[2:12:25.800 --> 2:12:31.800]  Bill Gates, who's big fans of Xi Jinping, has all the systems set up, all the new shows coming out about pandemics.
[2:12:31.800 --> 2:12:37.800]  He's got his Event 201 drill with the coronavirus killing 65 million people.
[2:12:37.800 --> 2:12:39.800]  That's happening October, November.
[2:12:39.800 --> 2:12:42.800]  You've got lockstep, the Rockefeller Foundation, all these preparations.
[2:12:42.800 --> 2:12:46.800]  And then it just builds up to this and then is exported against us.
[2:12:46.800 --> 2:12:48.800]  And then Trump is blamed.
[2:12:48.800 --> 2:12:49.800]  It's all his fault.
[2:12:49.800 --> 2:12:50.800]  It's all been coordinated.
[2:12:50.800 --> 2:12:53.800]  The question is by who?
[2:12:53.800 --> 2:12:55.800]  Yeah, well, it's interesting.
[2:12:55.800 --> 2:13:00.800]  If you look at the things that are coming out in China with the pandemic there,
[2:13:00.800 --> 2:13:02.800]  they're claiming they're having no new cases.
[2:13:02.800 --> 2:13:04.800]  This is complete fabrication.
[2:13:04.800 --> 2:13:08.800]  Nobody who's been following China closely believes China's numbers.
[2:13:08.800 --> 2:13:15.800]  There are these stories about them putting elderly in body bags and then in boxes and cremating them.
[2:13:15.800 --> 2:13:18.800]  There are stories about food not getting to the hospitals.
[2:13:18.800 --> 2:13:23.800]  So China has this very interesting information warfare campaign in China,
[2:13:23.800 --> 2:13:28.800]  which is dissuading the elderly from going to the hospital so that they simply die at home.
[2:13:28.800 --> 2:13:30.800]  They pick up the body, no musk, no fuss.
[2:13:30.800 --> 2:13:34.800]  They don't end up flooding the hospitals and they say, oh, we don't have any problem.
[2:13:34.800 --> 2:13:36.800]  So they're going around.
[2:13:36.800 --> 2:13:37.800]  They're picking up their elderly.
[2:13:37.800 --> 2:13:40.800]  They're burning enormous amounts of body.
[2:13:40.800 --> 2:13:50.800]  I had this report from Hong Kong last week that the cremation capacity in China is so overused
[2:13:50.800 --> 2:13:57.800]  that they are sending bodies to Hong Kong to be cremated 80 to 90 a night.
[2:13:57.800 --> 2:14:03.800]  So because Hong Kong, which is following sort of strictures like we are, has contained it,
[2:14:03.800 --> 2:14:06.800]  but they have excess cremation capacity.
[2:14:06.800 --> 2:14:12.800]  So there's these indications that they, as a totalitarian society, which lies to its people,
[2:14:12.800 --> 2:14:17.800]  and also there's a massive purge going on within the Communist Party,
[2:14:17.800 --> 2:14:21.800]  there's a kind of power struggle between the black hand and the white hand,
[2:14:21.800 --> 2:14:26.800]  the Jiang Zemin faction and the Xi Jinping faction.
[2:14:26.800 --> 2:14:32.800]  And there's been three assassination attempts in the past on Xi Jinping.
[2:14:32.800 --> 2:14:36.800]  And he is really trying to consolidate his power.
[2:14:36.800 --> 2:14:38.800]  And I believe he is a very ambitious leader.
[2:14:38.800 --> 2:14:41.800]  He has three heroes Xi Jinping has.
[2:14:41.800 --> 2:14:45.800]  If you look at the literature, if you look at Stephen Mosher's work and Bill Gertz's work,
[2:14:45.800 --> 2:14:50.800]  you'll see that Xi Jinping admires Hitler, he admires Mao, and he admires Stalin.
[2:14:50.800 --> 2:14:55.800]  And in the Guinness Book of World Records, these are the three biggest mass murderers in history.
[2:14:55.800 --> 2:14:57.800]  And he admires them.
[2:14:57.800 --> 2:15:01.800]  He very famously has said to one of his American friends years ago, Xi Jinping said,
[2:15:01.800 --> 2:15:05.800]  you know what's wrong with you Americans? You're too nice.
[2:15:05.800 --> 2:15:07.800]  Xi Jinping is not nice.
[2:15:07.800 --> 2:15:11.800]  And I think that it's very possible that this is some kind of plan.
[2:15:11.800 --> 2:15:16.800]  And the main question is whether Russia is going to be on board with them on this plan.
[2:15:16.800 --> 2:15:20.800]  I understand there's a lot of pressure being applied to Russia in Europe
[2:15:20.800 --> 2:15:28.800]  because Russia's initial propaganda campaign was detected in support of creating further mayhem in Europe
[2:15:28.800 --> 2:15:33.800]  in support of China's operation, which is definitely an information operation out of China too,
[2:15:33.800 --> 2:15:36.800]  because the Chinese are accusing us of creating the virus.
[2:15:36.800 --> 2:15:42.800]  And we know for a fact that these bat viruses were something that People's Liberation Army bio weapons program
[2:15:42.800 --> 2:15:50.800]  I have stacks of I have I have Italian TV five years ago showing China admitting that they were injecting it into people trying to get coronaviruses to go viral.
[2:15:50.800 --> 2:16:13.800]  We'll be right back with Jeff Nyquist.
[2:16:20.800 --> 2:16:22.800]  Welcome to SurvivalistCamps.com.
[2:16:51.800 --> 2:16:57.800]  If you're trying to quit drinking or doing too many drugs, listen to me.
[2:16:57.800 --> 2:16:59.800]  You don't know me and we'll never meet.
[2:16:59.800 --> 2:17:01.800]  I had a problem like you once.
[2:17:01.800 --> 2:17:07.800]  I drank and used to party a little too much till it got out of control and almost ruined my life.
[2:17:07.800 --> 2:17:12.800]  I realized I needed help to fix my problem before it totally destroyed me.
[2:17:12.800 --> 2:17:17.800]  If you've tried to fix your drinking and drug problem and you know you can't do it alone,
[2:17:17.800 --> 2:17:20.800]  you need to call the national treatment advisors.
[2:17:20.800 --> 2:17:27.800]  They'll immerse you into a 30 day program to replace your old habits with new habits and totally change your life.
[2:17:27.800 --> 2:17:32.800]  And if you have PPO private health insurance, the entire program may be covered.
[2:17:32.800 --> 2:17:36.800]  Fix your problem right now before it gets any worse.
[2:17:36.800 --> 2:17:37.800]  Get clean.
[2:17:37.800 --> 2:17:47.800]  Call now and learn more 800-506-6740-800-506-6740.
[2:17:47.800 --> 2:17:57.800]  That's 800-506-6740.
[2:17:57.800 --> 2:18:02.800]  Listen, there's a show from PBS called It's Okay to Be Smart.
[2:18:02.800 --> 2:18:10.800]  So everyone who's been smart and has been put down for it and persecuted, it's okay to finally be smart.
[2:18:10.800 --> 2:18:14.800]  That's right. There's not two sexes and families are bad.
[2:18:14.800 --> 2:18:18.800]  And the right thing to do is to sterilize your son so he doesn't become an evil warmonger.
[2:18:18.800 --> 2:18:22.800]  I mean, a lot of feminists are saying we should have the government pass laws that mail embryos account.
[2:18:22.800 --> 2:18:29.800]  But what's better and more reformed and more humanitarian is to convince them when they're five years old to have their testicles chopped off
[2:18:29.800 --> 2:18:34.800]  and again, global warming's real. We've got to pay Lord Rothschild all of our money and the pandemic's all real.
[2:18:34.800 --> 2:18:39.800]  We've got to be locked up in our houses. We've got to use the language the universities say.
[2:18:39.800 --> 2:18:44.800]  We're not a culture or anything. Oh, no, no, we're not. We're good people.
[2:18:44.800 --> 2:18:48.800]  We're good people that went to these corporate systems that didn't brainwash us.
[2:18:48.800 --> 2:18:53.800]  No, no, they enlightened us how to censor and how to rule and how to control.
[2:18:53.800 --> 2:19:03.800]  You have to look really hard at mainstream television news and print media and mainstream establishment media news sites to find it.
[2:19:03.800 --> 2:19:06.800]  I did extensive searches online with different search engines.
[2:19:06.800 --> 2:19:15.800]  I did a bunch of research looking at different TV archives and I couldn't find hardly anything except a couple local news stories
[2:19:15.800 --> 2:19:25.800]  with medical doctors on there talking about zinc, zinc, zinc, the element on the periodic table that is essential to life.
[2:19:25.800 --> 2:19:35.800]  And that is the most antiviral natural compound out there in thousands and thousands of studies by the most prestigious universities,
[2:19:35.800 --> 2:19:39.800]  including big studies on the coronavirus family.
[2:19:39.800 --> 2:19:45.800]  So do yourself a favor, search engine, zinc and antiviral.
[2:19:45.800 --> 2:20:14.800]  Three words, zinc, antiviral, zinc, antiviral. Do yourself a favor, zinc, antiviral.
[2:20:14.800 --> 2:20:19.800]  Welcome back. I'm Alex Jones, your host, really respected researcher and journalist.
[2:20:19.800 --> 2:20:28.800]  Jeff Nyquist of jrnyquist.com is with us, writes for great folks at Epic Times and others, rolling it daily.
[2:20:28.800 --> 2:20:30.800]  He's just laying out the facts.
[2:20:30.800 --> 2:20:36.800]  I'm going to continue to give you the floor right now about where you think this is going, how you think their war is going.
[2:20:36.800 --> 2:20:39.800]  Clearly, it's a deep state globalist ally of the Communist China move.
[2:20:39.800 --> 2:20:41.800]  We're getting into Xi Jinping.
[2:20:41.800 --> 2:20:43.800]  Anybody can look this up.
[2:20:43.800 --> 2:20:46.800]  John Record does admire Hitler, Stalin, and Mao.
[2:20:46.800 --> 2:20:48.800]  He is an autocrat.
[2:20:48.800 --> 2:20:50.800]  He's an authoritarian.
[2:20:50.800 --> 2:20:57.800]  And the left totally protects him because they use China as a command base to carry out money laundering and other criminal activities.
[2:20:57.800 --> 2:20:59.800]  China bombs us with fentanyl.
[2:20:59.800 --> 2:21:00.800]  Enough to seize it.
[2:21:00.800 --> 2:21:01.800]  Mexico being brought in by the Chagoms.
[2:21:01.800 --> 2:21:07.800]  As you know, last year to kill 10.6 billion people, they all took, you know, a overdose of it.
[2:21:07.800 --> 2:21:10.800]  That's the type of stuff they're hitting us with.
[2:21:10.800 --> 2:21:14.800]  And so give us any facets you want to cover.
[2:21:14.800 --> 2:21:21.800]  There's so many angles to this, but getting into Xi Jinping and his psychology and what you think he thinks of Trump.
[2:21:21.800 --> 2:21:23.800]  Well, that's an interesting question.
[2:21:23.800 --> 2:21:26.800]  It's hard to get inside of Xi Jinping's mind, but...
[2:21:26.800 --> 2:21:27.800]  Well, let's ask this.
[2:21:27.800 --> 2:21:32.800]  How was he able, even though his father was reportedly tortured by the Communist Party of China and Mao,
[2:21:32.800 --> 2:21:37.800]  how was he able to come from where he went and get into power?
[2:21:37.800 --> 2:21:45.800]  Well, of course, in China, they have a very famous political, very deep political history.
[2:21:45.800 --> 2:21:46.800]  You've heard of Sun Tzu.
[2:21:46.800 --> 2:21:48.800]  There's Han Fei Tzu.
[2:21:48.800 --> 2:21:52.800]  These are Machiavelli's on steroids.
[2:21:52.800 --> 2:22:00.800]  The cultural political tradition of China is one of intrigue and conspiracy, double agents and infiltration.
[2:22:00.800 --> 2:22:02.800]  They were way ahead in this game.
[2:22:02.800 --> 2:22:12.800]  You know, the earliest story of a false defector in history comes from China in the 19th century BC in ancient records.
[2:22:12.800 --> 2:22:18.800]  So the Chinese have this very rich history of spies, counter-spies, infiltration,
[2:22:18.800 --> 2:22:31.800]  and they have for centuries, lionized people who are agents of influence and traitors who get into a government and turn it on its head.
[2:22:31.800 --> 2:22:32.800]  These are the games.
[2:22:32.800 --> 2:22:40.800]  Of course, we know the story of Zheng Zemin, how he was humbled by Mao Zedong.
[2:22:40.800 --> 2:22:49.800]  And then after Mao's death, he merged, struck down the gang of four and took power and led China in a different direction.
[2:22:49.800 --> 2:22:55.800]  Xi Jinping has a similar story because the turns of politics in China with one group,
[2:22:55.800 --> 2:23:02.800]  in-party group, having the upper hand and then another, Xi Jinping is a major power player.
[2:23:02.800 --> 2:23:10.800]  The Communist Party of China, of course, as earlier leaders of China have said,
[2:23:10.800 --> 2:23:19.800]  is part of a secret front of socialist communist groups that exist worldwide.
[2:23:19.800 --> 2:23:30.800]  This is controversial to say, but it's very interesting that Russia and China are both supporting communist revolutions and regimes around the world right now.
[2:23:30.800 --> 2:23:36.800]  If you talk about the end of the Cold War, the defeat of communism, wait a minute.
[2:23:36.800 --> 2:23:40.800]  Nepal became a communist country some years ago, taken over by Maoists.
[2:23:40.800 --> 2:23:43.800]  Angola, the communist won the Civil War in Angola.
[2:23:43.800 --> 2:23:50.800]  Congo had a revolution in 97, South Africa, the ANC is a front for the Communist Party of South Africa.
[2:23:50.800 --> 2:23:55.800]  We have Venezuela, Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega is in power there.
[2:23:55.800 --> 2:24:02.800]  Around the world, communist revolutions have been taking place quietly behind the surface.
[2:24:02.800 --> 2:24:06.800]  And Russia and China both have troops in Venezuela.
[2:24:06.800 --> 2:24:08.800]  They're both supporting Nicaragua.
[2:24:08.800 --> 2:24:12.800]  They're both supporting Cuba on the 100th anniversary of the Bolshevik Revolution.
[2:24:12.800 --> 2:24:14.800]  You can look this up.
[2:24:14.800 --> 2:24:22.800]  Vladimir Putin gave a speech before the organization of communist youth and students.
[2:24:22.800 --> 2:24:26.800]  And there were like 10,000 of them gathered there at Sochi.
[2:24:26.800 --> 2:24:30.800]  And he said, we are behind you. We believe in you. You are the future.
[2:24:30.800 --> 2:24:33.800]  We're the words in his speech. You can watch that speech if you want.
[2:24:33.800 --> 2:24:35.800]  It's a very peculiar speech.
[2:24:35.800 --> 2:24:39.800]  I have talked to defectors over the years.
[2:24:39.800 --> 2:24:46.800]  I have studied this and it takes me back to a defector named Anatoly Galitsin,
[2:24:46.800 --> 2:24:54.800]  who wrote a book called New Lives for Old in 1984 in which he predicted everything that happened from 1989 down to the present.
[2:24:54.800 --> 2:25:00.800]  By 1994, nearly 94% of his predictions had been proven correct.
[2:25:00.800 --> 2:25:03.800]  He predicted the fall of the Berlin Wall, the collapse of the Warsaw Pact,
[2:25:03.800 --> 2:25:06.800]  the collapse of the Communist Party Soviet Union,
[2:25:06.800 --> 2:25:10.800]  the advent of democracy in Russia.
[2:25:10.800 --> 2:25:16.800]  But he said it was all a strategy.
[2:25:16.800 --> 2:25:22.800]  It was a planned collapse. They planned it for 40 years, 30 plus years.
[2:25:22.800 --> 2:25:29.800]  They initiated the plan together with China that the Sino-Soviet split was part of the plan, according to Galitsin.
[2:25:29.800 --> 2:25:32.800]  And there are so many things that have come true.
[2:25:32.800 --> 2:25:39.800]  He predicted that after they initiated this plan, if the West believed that the changes in the Soviet Union were legitimate,
[2:25:39.800 --> 2:25:45.800]  that we would lose track of our nuclear arsenal.
[2:25:45.800 --> 2:25:50.800]  We would not renew it, which we haven't done, and that our deterrent would start to become weaker and weaker.
[2:25:50.800 --> 2:25:57.800]  Meanwhile, China and Russia, and this goes directly to the terrifying testimony of our STRATCOM commander last month,
[2:25:57.800 --> 2:26:02.800]  he said while we were allowing our nuclear deterrent to rot in age,
[2:26:02.800 --> 2:26:06.800]  China and Russia have been intensively modernizing their nuclear forces.
[2:26:06.800 --> 2:26:12.800]  And so if we lose that nuclear deterrent, the world belongs to Russia and China.
[2:26:12.800 --> 2:26:15.800]  Well, let's be clear about this.
[2:26:15.800 --> 2:26:21.800]  Obama and the globalists have been debilitating the U.S. and demoralizing us by design,
[2:26:21.800 --> 2:26:25.800]  and then preparing at the college level the malice operating system.
[2:26:25.800 --> 2:26:29.800]  I don't just say that. Every college, as you know, the public needs to know this is not hyperbole.
[2:26:29.800 --> 2:26:35.800]  The malice model is the model of a youth rebellion, an anti-faisal malice,
[2:26:35.800 --> 2:26:41.800]  and you've got the Confucius societies and the head chemist at Harvard caught being a CHICOM agent.
[2:26:41.800 --> 2:26:45.800]  I mean, the infiltration has been massive, and they're really pissed that Trump started, I think,
[2:26:45.800 --> 2:26:48.800]  turn the tide against them as we identify this.
[2:26:48.800 --> 2:26:53.800]  But if Trump just points out that, no, Gigi Pink's horrible, he's terrible, he infiltrated our country.
[2:26:53.800 --> 2:26:56.800]  Obama and others were on his payroll. Hillary's on the payroll.
[2:26:56.800 --> 2:27:02.800]  Americans will unify behind that, because this is real fourth-generational, fifth-generational warfare,
[2:27:02.800 --> 2:27:05.800]  and I think we can pretty much reverse this quickly.
[2:27:05.800 --> 2:27:08.800]  Yeah, it's interesting what President Trump has done.
[2:27:08.800 --> 2:27:14.800]  I see a kind of strategy in him saying, Putin is my friend, Gigi Pink is my friend,
[2:27:14.800 --> 2:27:20.800]  because that makes it harder for them to attack the United States if the president is calling them a friend.
[2:27:20.800 --> 2:27:26.800]  It sort of puts them in a difficult position to commit the kind of actions that they want to commit.
[2:27:26.800 --> 2:27:28.800]  So it's a very clever strategy.
[2:27:28.800 --> 2:27:34.800]  And then to back them into a corner, Trump's unexpected election was a game changer.
[2:27:34.800 --> 2:27:39.800]  If Hillary Clinton had gotten in, you can imagine she would have continued the disarmament.
[2:27:39.800 --> 2:27:44.800]  There would have been no even small program to renew our nuclear warheads.
[2:27:44.800 --> 2:27:48.800]  We're going to start being able to produce nuclear warheads in 2025,
[2:27:48.800 --> 2:27:50.800]  and hopefully that can be accelerated.
[2:27:50.800 --> 2:27:54.800]  I think that's what the STRATCOM commander wants, is a bigger commitment.
[2:27:54.800 --> 2:27:59.800]  And the Chinese and Russians have gained such tremendous advantages,
[2:27:59.800 --> 2:28:02.800]  nearing the point where they were tipping the balance of power in their favor.
[2:28:02.800 --> 2:28:09.800]  Suddenly saw Trump coming in, putting more money into the military, playing the trade war game with them,
[2:28:09.800 --> 2:28:11.800]  taking away their unfair trade practices.
[2:28:11.800 --> 2:28:15.800]  Well, it's like Trump said, he said, we've been in a trade war with China for 40 years and losing.
[2:28:15.800 --> 2:28:19.800]  I'm not starting a trade war. We're simply fighting back.
[2:28:19.800 --> 2:28:21.800]  That's right. Absolutely.
[2:28:21.800 --> 2:28:23.800]  And of course, this was too much for the Chinese.
[2:28:23.800 --> 2:28:24.800]  So what is their reaction?
[2:28:24.800 --> 2:28:31.800]  Bam, biological attack, COVID-19 virus, flatten our markets, deprive us of the money.
[2:28:31.800 --> 2:28:35.800]  And Trump knows what to do to flood it with cash, even though it will cause problems later.
[2:28:35.800 --> 2:28:37.800]  We'd be in a depression right now if he didn't do it.
[2:28:37.800 --> 2:28:41.800]  Right. Well, we have to, you know, the president is guarding against the def...
[2:28:41.800 --> 2:28:45.800]  We're going to get hit by a hard deflation because of the first deflation.
[2:28:45.800 --> 2:28:47.800]  Well, exactly. People worry about inflation in the short term.
[2:28:47.800 --> 2:28:49.800]  It's going to be a deflation as well.
[2:28:49.800 --> 2:29:12.800]  You're smart. Let's talk about that with Mr. Nyquist.
[2:29:20.800 --> 2:29:28.800]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla. I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[2:29:28.800 --> 2:29:32.800]  I sued the IRS in one. I beat the IRS then and I've been beating them ever since.
[2:29:32.800 --> 2:29:38.800]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.

[2:31:13.800 --> 2:31:19.800]  Now, every other major food manufacturer in the storeable food area has been sold out for a long time.
[2:31:19.800 --> 2:31:22.800]  Many of them are still telling you they got food. They don't.
[2:31:22.800 --> 2:31:25.800]  We do, but it takes time to package it and get it out to you.
[2:31:25.800 --> 2:31:31.800]  The bad news is, hey, I hope the virus blows over, but the globalist trying to cancel the election
[2:31:31.800 --> 2:31:36.800]  and the economy may go south now more than ever is the time to have high-quality storeable food
[2:31:36.800 --> 2:31:39.800]  and the place to get it is infowarstore.com.
[2:31:39.800 --> 2:31:43.800]  So, a lot of you got the food from us. You've loved it. It's been very helpful for you and your family.
[2:31:43.800 --> 2:31:47.800]  Now is the time to double down with as crazy as this world is.
[2:31:47.800 --> 2:31:51.800]  If they're able to take Trump down, we are screwed. We've got to fend for ourselves.
[2:31:51.800 --> 2:31:54.800]  infowarstore.com
[2:31:54.800 --> 2:32:00.800]  There is a paradox. Yes, this virus is deadly and does kill people.
[2:32:00.800 --> 2:32:07.800]  And so do many other countless viruses that have already existed, that do exist and will exist.
[2:32:07.800 --> 2:32:13.800]  But when Trump says the cure is worse than disease, he's talking about the media hype
[2:32:13.800 --> 2:32:18.800]  creating hysteria and trying to create uncertainty.
[2:32:18.800 --> 2:32:21.800]  And it is that that I oppose.
[2:32:21.800 --> 2:32:28.800]  It is not the American way to cower and live in fear and to follow the edicts and precedents
[2:32:28.800 --> 2:32:33.800]  set by Communist China and hyper-authoritarian Singapore,
[2:32:33.800 --> 2:32:40.800]  where you're now being given six months in jail if you don't stand at least six feet away from someone.
[2:32:40.800 --> 2:32:47.800]  This is being used by social engineers and they admit that they are trying to transform our world forever
[2:32:47.800 --> 2:32:51.800]  into something unrecognizable from what it's been.
[2:32:51.800 --> 2:33:04.800]  We are not slaves and we must not act like it.
[2:33:21.800 --> 2:33:27.800]  Don't know much about history. Don't know much about biology.
[2:33:27.800 --> 2:33:34.800]  Don't know much about a science book. Don't know much about the French I've took.
[2:33:34.800 --> 2:33:40.800]  But I do know that I love you. And I know that if you love me.
[2:33:40.800 --> 2:33:44.800]  When the people don't know history, they're going to repeat it. Well, I do know about history
[2:33:44.800 --> 2:33:48.800]  and I do know about biology and I do know about authoritarianism.
[2:33:48.800 --> 2:33:53.800]  And I see our media, our supposed big tech companies, worshiping Gigi Bing.
[2:33:53.800 --> 2:33:59.800]  I mean, Apple runs slave factories. They have Uyghur slaves building components.
[2:33:59.800 --> 2:34:03.800]  That's confirmed. And people go, it's okay. Tim Cook's gay.
[2:34:03.800 --> 2:34:07.800]  I mean, as long as you're trendy and gay, I mean, you can have death camps.
[2:34:07.800 --> 2:34:11.800]  Unless you just wear a little non-threatening black T-shirt and go, oh hi, I'm Tim Cook.
[2:34:11.800 --> 2:34:19.800]  Hey, I have a basement of dead kids. I guess it's okay. It's just crazy.
[2:34:19.800 --> 2:34:24.800]  So looking at some of your other points with Mr. Nyquist, who's here with us right now,
[2:34:24.800 --> 2:34:29.800]  who writes for Epic Times and other great publications like WorldNet Daily.
[2:34:29.800 --> 2:34:36.800]  When you get into one of the other notes you sent me about the worldview of this particular general you talk about,
[2:34:36.800 --> 2:34:41.800]  how does that tie into all of this? And again, how do you think Trump's doing
[2:34:41.800 --> 2:34:47.800]  getting America in a realist footing against what's unfolding?
[2:34:47.800 --> 2:34:51.800]  And now that I think about it before I went to break, we were talking about the economy and what Trump's done.
[2:34:51.800 --> 2:34:57.800]  I don't like all this giant spending. I don't like where it goes, but he's starting to federalize the Federal Reserve.
[2:34:57.800 --> 2:35:01.800]  That's a way to take it over, I guess. I see that as positive.
[2:35:01.800 --> 2:35:09.800]  But I'm not an economist, but I do study these things with unemployment exploding with tens of millions out of work
[2:35:09.800 --> 2:35:12.800]  each month that were shut down in big corporations in the States.
[2:35:12.800 --> 2:35:16.800]  And the left are saying they're going to keep it shut down for another 100 days.
[2:35:16.800 --> 2:35:22.800]  I've talked to a lot of corporate people, what they've been told from the higher ups is two months bare minimum,
[2:35:22.800 --> 2:35:27.800]  probably at least another 100 days. Bill Gates is in the news saying he wants 100 days starting yesterday.
[2:35:27.800 --> 2:35:32.800]  And he seems to be calling the shots as the globalist science officer running so much of this.
[2:35:32.800 --> 2:35:39.800]  So from the perspective of the economy stalling, and they do put out this $4 trillion from the U.S.
[2:35:39.800 --> 2:35:45.800]  and a couple trillion more out of the Federal Reserve and promise $14 trillion more in liquidity,
[2:35:45.800 --> 2:35:51.800]  will that cause inflation or will that cause deflation?
[2:35:51.800 --> 2:35:58.800]  I think that they've balanced it, so I think it's hard to say exactly because we've got these bubbles bursting.
[2:35:58.800 --> 2:36:03.800]  So there's the danger of a deflation, a deflationary depression.
[2:36:03.800 --> 2:36:10.800]  But by this spending bill, and we have not been as inflationary with the dollar as the Europeans have been with their currencies,
[2:36:10.800 --> 2:36:14.800]  and the dollar, we'll see how it goes.
[2:36:14.800 --> 2:36:18.800]  But it should have an counteracting effect on the deflationary cycle.
[2:36:18.800 --> 2:36:23.800]  We're going to have more unemployment, of course, as the economy adjusts.
[2:36:23.800 --> 2:36:30.800]  Remember, economies are based on human behavior, which is habitual, economic decisions,
[2:36:30.800 --> 2:36:33.800]  and those kind of decisions are going to be changing.
[2:36:33.800 --> 2:36:39.800]  So we're going to be in a period of adaptation, and it is not going to go back to the way it was.
[2:36:39.800 --> 2:36:48.800]  I think that we can make that statement because Xi Jinping probably released the virus intentionally.
[2:36:48.800 --> 2:36:54.800]  If he did not, if it was an accidental release, he intentionally let it go out from China.
[2:36:54.800 --> 2:36:59.800]  He used the Chinese New Year, the greatest period of air travel from...
[2:36:59.800 --> 2:37:01.800]  To incubate and spread it.
[2:37:01.800 --> 2:37:04.800]  That's right. Absolutely. You look back at the record of what they did.
[2:37:04.800 --> 2:37:08.800]  They used their agents in the World Health Organization to lie to the world.
[2:37:08.800 --> 2:37:13.800]  The Democrats followed that and said, keep the airlines coming in, go to Chinatown.
[2:37:13.800 --> 2:37:17.800]  All of them came out and said that, including the Speaker of the House Pelosi.
[2:37:17.800 --> 2:37:19.800]  And then they turned around and blamed Trump.
[2:37:19.800 --> 2:37:22.800]  That's right, which is ridiculous. Let's get a backfire on them.
[2:37:22.800 --> 2:37:25.800]  And I'll tell you what to watch for next.
[2:37:25.800 --> 2:37:30.800]  It's this General Qi Hao Chen speech. Very important. Everybody should study it.
[2:37:30.800 --> 2:37:34.800]  They should look at this speech. General Qi Hao Chen, the defense minister,
[2:37:34.800 --> 2:37:38.800]  using biological weapons. When you put that together with the two Chinese colonels
[2:37:38.800 --> 2:37:43.800]  who wrote the unrestricted warfare book in 1999, this is right out of their book.
[2:37:43.800 --> 2:37:45.800]  This is an asymmetrical weapon.
[2:37:45.800 --> 2:37:49.800]  China can adapt to it because they're a police society. They can use it to kill off their elderly.
[2:37:49.800 --> 2:37:52.800]  They want to do that. The government is ruthless.
[2:37:52.800 --> 2:37:55.800]  Here we're trying to protect our elderly and vulnerable citizens.
[2:37:55.800 --> 2:37:59.800]  So it's costing us economically. But the West is inventive.
[2:37:59.800 --> 2:38:02.800]  It's able to adapt. But here's the interesting thing.
[2:38:02.800 --> 2:38:05.800]  Both China and Russia have closed their borders.
[2:38:05.800 --> 2:38:09.800]  If we look at this release as the beginning of a biological war,
[2:38:09.800 --> 2:38:12.800]  the closing of Russia and China's borders.
[2:38:12.800 --> 2:38:16.800]  Not letting anyone from the outside means that they could have prepared
[2:38:16.800 --> 2:38:20.800]  a more virulent strain of this virus.
[2:38:20.800 --> 2:38:23.800]  You notice the virus has four inserts.
[2:38:23.800 --> 2:38:27.800]  One that attacks the lungs, the heart, the kidneys and the testicles.
[2:38:27.800 --> 2:38:32.800]  If they have a slightly different genetic version of it,
[2:38:32.800 --> 2:38:37.800]  they could unleash this on us. It could have a much higher death rate,
[2:38:37.800 --> 2:38:40.800]  causing a much deeper panic in the country.
[2:38:40.800 --> 2:38:44.800]  And since they've closed their borders, it won't blow back on them.
[2:38:44.800 --> 2:38:47.800]  It's very alarming to me that they've totally closed off their borders.
[2:38:47.800 --> 2:38:50.800]  They're still having cases. They're lying about having cases.
[2:38:50.800 --> 2:38:54.800]  But they're containing it through their own system as I explained earlier.
[2:38:54.800 --> 2:38:57.800]  Let's be clear. They let people leave while not letting people come in.
[2:38:57.800 --> 2:38:59.800]  Very, very suspicious.
[2:38:59.800 --> 2:39:03.800]  And as you said, then they can release a more virulent strain
[2:39:03.800 --> 2:39:07.800]  that's covered by the earlier strain and have their operatives release it.
[2:39:07.800 --> 2:39:10.800]  And that's what the Army Times and others are reporting.
[2:39:10.800 --> 2:39:15.800]  Because they've been catching all these chikoms coming in and out of the United States beforehand.
[2:39:15.800 --> 2:39:19.800]  And the FBI warned, this is American military news,
[2:39:19.800 --> 2:39:26.800]  of Chinese researchers transporting disease samples into the U.S. before coronavirus.
[2:39:26.800 --> 2:39:29.800]  And they caught the other Chinese agents trying to get them out.
[2:39:29.800 --> 2:39:33.800]  So this is serious. And if this is the opening salvo in a war,
[2:39:33.800 --> 2:39:36.800]  what do you expect to come next?
[2:39:36.800 --> 2:39:39.800]  Well, like I say, a more virulent strain.
[2:39:39.800 --> 2:39:44.800]  The thing is, the United States policy is to launch nuclear strikes
[2:39:44.800 --> 2:39:46.800]  in response to a biological attack.
[2:39:46.800 --> 2:39:49.800]  Now you have a situation where deterrence has failed.
[2:39:49.800 --> 2:39:54.800]  If I think the U.S. government now, they know that this virus was engineered,
[2:39:54.800 --> 2:39:57.800]  they're not saying it publicly. They don't want to scare the public.
[2:39:57.800 --> 2:39:59.800]  Well, let me stop you. You're actually right.
[2:39:59.800 --> 2:40:02.800]  You had Senator Cotton and Holly and others come out and say,
[2:40:02.800 --> 2:40:05.800]  we think they probably released it. There'll be a day of reckoning.
[2:40:05.800 --> 2:40:08.800]  The Tim Downing Street said, we are infuriated. You will pay.
[2:40:08.800 --> 2:40:10.800]  There will be a reckoning. We're going to make you a pariah state.
[2:40:10.800 --> 2:40:13.800]  We're going to cut you off. You never see the British talking like that.
[2:40:13.800 --> 2:40:17.800]  I mean, there's almost, in the statements out of the Pentagon
[2:40:17.800 --> 2:40:21.800]  and out of the Senate Intelligence Committee, is very threatening to China.
[2:40:21.800 --> 2:40:24.800]  And so I think they're telegraphing they know.
[2:40:24.800 --> 2:40:27.800]  They, I think that they know that we're at the beginning of a war.
[2:40:27.800 --> 2:40:31.800]  How much this war will escalate? How, where will it go?
[2:40:31.800 --> 2:40:37.800]  The ultimate end would be if it went completely out of control nuclear, of course.
[2:40:37.800 --> 2:40:41.800]  It depends on how stable Russia and China are,
[2:40:41.800 --> 2:40:45.800]  how confident their leaders are, whether the power struggles within those countries
[2:40:45.800 --> 2:40:48.800]  devolve and they back away from this kind of strategy.
[2:40:48.800 --> 2:40:53.800]  And if the globalists realize how reckless this is and stopping all in with China.
[2:40:53.800 --> 2:40:58.800]  Yeah. Well, it's very interesting because all these big money people
[2:40:58.800 --> 2:41:02.800]  who've climbed into bed with China, look at what they've done.
[2:41:02.800 --> 2:41:07.800]  They have facilitated our enemy getting control of our supply chain.
[2:41:07.800 --> 2:41:10.800]  Right now, Xi Jinping threatened the world and said,
[2:41:10.800 --> 2:41:12.800]  oh, well, we'll cut off your pharmaceuticals.
[2:41:12.800 --> 2:41:15.800]  We make your antibiotics. We make your high blood pressure medication.
[2:41:15.800 --> 2:41:19.800]  If you don't trade with us, if you don't open yourselves up,
[2:41:19.800 --> 2:41:23.800]  you know, you talk about an opium war. They're using pharmaceuticals.
[2:41:23.800 --> 2:41:24.800]  It's a pharmaceutical war.
[2:41:24.800 --> 2:41:27.800]  Trump is just honest that they're holding us hostage.
[2:41:27.800 --> 2:41:31.800]  We're not wimps. It will break the GZPYG's political power
[2:41:31.800 --> 2:41:34.800]  and we then focus that on the Democrats and the globalists.
[2:41:34.800 --> 2:41:35.800]  They're politically done.
[2:41:35.800 --> 2:41:40.800]  Trump uses this now with information warfare truth by being absolutely honest.
[2:41:40.800 --> 2:41:44.800]  America will line up behind the president, but only if he's bold, I believe.
[2:41:44.800 --> 2:41:46.800]  Yeah. And he has to be.
[2:41:46.800 --> 2:41:48.800]  And of course, he's a person of instinct.
[2:41:48.800 --> 2:41:51.800]  He's a guy who, I mean, look at what his sister said about him.
[2:41:51.800 --> 2:41:55.800]  You know, the people who really knew him thought he was going to win the election.
[2:41:55.800 --> 2:41:57.800]  When nobody thought he had a chance, his sister said,
[2:41:57.800 --> 2:42:01.800]  well, what I learned when I was a child was you don't play games with Donald
[2:42:01.800 --> 2:42:05.800]  always wins. And his wife said something similar.
[2:42:05.800 --> 2:42:08.800]  And I think that the Chinese have decided to play a game,
[2:42:08.800 --> 2:42:11.800]  a very dangerous game with Donald Trump.
[2:42:11.800 --> 2:42:15.800]  And he is as a, you know, a lot of things in the world.
[2:42:15.800 --> 2:42:20.800]  It isn't necessarily how intellectually astute you are.
[2:42:20.800 --> 2:42:25.800]  That's important, of course, but instinct seems to be the king.
[2:42:25.800 --> 2:42:26.800]  And this president has.
[2:42:26.800 --> 2:42:30.800]  Because that's the deep reservoir of the entire genetic memory and instincts
[2:42:30.800 --> 2:42:32.800]  and learning of the subconscious brain.
[2:42:32.800 --> 2:42:35.800]  That's the total expression of real intelligence is instinct.
[2:42:35.800 --> 2:42:37.800]  We just call it instinct, as you know.
[2:42:37.800 --> 2:42:42.800]  Oh, yeah. And in fact, he shows that in spades and he,
[2:42:42.800 --> 2:42:46.800]  how he was able to defeat his Republican rivals for the nomination
[2:42:46.800 --> 2:42:49.800]  and then go on to defeat Hillary Clinton despite the whole.
[2:42:49.800 --> 2:42:51.800]  We've got to go to break a few minutes with you that I'm going to take calls.
[2:42:51.800 --> 2:42:53.800]  Folks, stay with us.
[2:42:53.800 --> 2:42:56.800]  One of our best selling products is living defense.
[2:42:56.800 --> 2:42:59.800]  And it's been sold out for over four months because it's hard to source
[2:42:59.800 --> 2:43:00.800]  the ingredients that are organic.
[2:43:00.800 --> 2:43:03.800]  We've got a limited supply right now, but it's selling out fast.
[2:43:03.800 --> 2:43:05.800]  And I want those of you that haven't experienced living defense
[2:43:05.800 --> 2:43:06.800]  to get it for yourself.
[2:43:06.800 --> 2:43:08.800]  Here's just part of one testimonial.
[2:43:08.800 --> 2:43:11.800]  I look in January 2016, I went in a hospital.
[2:43:11.800 --> 2:43:13.800]  I went to VA hospital out here in Boyce.
[2:43:13.800 --> 2:43:14.800]  And I was in there until June.
[2:43:14.800 --> 2:43:17.800]  And one of the only things that got me through that ordeal
[2:43:17.800 --> 2:43:20.800]  was listening to info wars three hours a day.
[2:43:20.800 --> 2:43:24.800]  And I kept hearing Dr. Group and all you guys talking about living defense.
[2:43:24.800 --> 2:43:25.800]  Let me tell you something, man.
[2:43:25.800 --> 2:43:29.800]  I had an internal digestive problem and I suffered with it for about five or six years.
[2:43:29.800 --> 2:43:31.800]  And the doctors, they tried every test.
[2:43:31.800 --> 2:43:33.800]  Nobody could figure out what it is.
[2:43:33.800 --> 2:43:36.800]  And then every day when I kept hearing you and Dr. Group and those commercials,
[2:43:36.800 --> 2:43:37.800]  I said, you know what?
[2:43:37.800 --> 2:43:39.800]  I'm going to get me some of that freaking living defense.
[2:43:39.800 --> 2:43:42.800]  Now, I wasn't supposed to have any nutritionals because they don't want you to have a stuff.
[2:43:42.800 --> 2:43:44.800]  But I ordered it, had it shipped to me.
[2:43:44.800 --> 2:43:45.800]  I got it.
[2:43:45.800 --> 2:43:46.800]  I hid it from the nurses.
[2:43:46.800 --> 2:43:47.800]  I started taking it, man.
[2:43:47.800 --> 2:43:49.800]  That stuff changed my life.
[2:43:49.800 --> 2:43:50.800]  It saved my life.
[2:43:50.800 --> 2:43:53.800]  Alex Jones and info wars saved my life.
[2:43:53.800 --> 2:44:00.800]  Every week, every day, every hour, every minute, every second right now is critical.
[2:44:00.800 --> 2:44:04.800]  History is happening right in front of us and we can't be spectators.
[2:44:04.800 --> 2:44:08.800]  We've got to be men and women in the arena regardless of race, color, creed, age,
[2:44:08.800 --> 2:44:09.800]  sexual privacy.
[2:44:09.800 --> 2:44:10.800]  It doesn't matter.
[2:44:10.800 --> 2:44:14.800]  The globalist with the chai comms and others are openly trying to plunge our economy
[2:44:14.800 --> 2:44:15.800]  and start a new depression.
[2:44:15.800 --> 2:44:19.800]  China, who hyped up this virus is now back to work and ramping up their economy.
[2:44:19.800 --> 2:44:24.800]  While ours is going into a freefall spiral and Trump's desperately trying to restart
[2:44:24.800 --> 2:44:29.800]  it and create confidence in the globalist corporate media that was worshiping China just
[2:44:29.800 --> 2:44:30.800]  a month or so ago.
[2:44:30.800 --> 2:44:35.800]  And their response is saying Trump is terrible because they want America to fail.
[2:44:35.800 --> 2:44:36.800]  They want you to fail.
[2:44:36.800 --> 2:44:38.800]  But you could expose them.
[2:44:38.800 --> 2:44:39.800]  You could speak out.
[2:44:39.800 --> 2:44:43.800]  You could share the articles and videos and reports at info wars and band-op video that
[2:44:43.800 --> 2:44:46.800]  expose them and the globalist will go down.
[2:44:46.800 --> 2:44:48.800]  It's already blowing up in their face right now.
[2:44:48.800 --> 2:44:54.800]  So, press the attack on the info war and defeat the NWO.
[2:44:54.800 --> 2:44:59.800]  Newtonian physics documents the fact that for every action there's an opposite and equal
[2:44:59.800 --> 2:45:00.800]  reaction.
[2:45:00.800 --> 2:45:01.800]  And that matter is not destroyed.
[2:45:01.800 --> 2:45:05.800]  It is simply transferred into another form.
[2:45:05.800 --> 2:45:07.800]  Well, we're seeing that happen right now.
[2:45:07.800 --> 2:45:11.800]  The globalists are openly trying to hype up the coronavirus, trying to kill our economy
[2:45:11.800 --> 2:45:16.800]  and trying to have martial law shutdown around the country and trying to stampede Trump into
[2:45:16.800 --> 2:45:20.800]  implementing it so they can blame the imploding economy on him.
[2:45:20.800 --> 2:45:24.800]  But Trump has seen through it and so he's let them implement the draconian controls and
[2:45:24.800 --> 2:45:28.800]  is saying do you really want a depression for something that's killed far less than
[2:45:28.800 --> 2:45:29.800]  the flu?
[2:45:29.800 --> 2:45:31.800]  Ladies and gentlemen, now is the fight of our lives.
[2:45:31.800 --> 2:45:36.800]  And the good news is their attack on humanity and on independent media has caused a lot
[2:45:36.800 --> 2:45:38.800]  of people to start thinking for themselves.
[2:45:38.800 --> 2:45:44.800]  And so the traffic to info wars dot com and band-op video is triple our previous records
[2:45:44.800 --> 2:45:45.800]  right now.
[2:45:45.800 --> 2:45:49.800]  So you're doing a great job spreading the word and people are tuning in to find out
[2:45:49.800 --> 2:46:18.800]  the truth.
[2:46:18.800 --> 2:46:44.800]  Thank you.
[2:46:44.800 --> 2:47:00.800]  Thank you.
[2:47:14.800 --> 2:47:38.800]  Thank you.
[2:47:38.800 --> 2:48:05.800]  Thank you.
[2:48:05.800 --> 2:48:34.800]  Thank you.
[2:48:34.800 --> 2:48:59.800]  Thank you.
[2:48:59.800 --> 2:49:25.800]  Thank you.
[2:49:25.800 --> 2:49:51.800]  Thank you.
[2:49:51.800 --> 2:50:20.800]  Thank you.
[2:50:20.800 --> 2:50:46.800]  Thank you.
[2:50:46.800 --> 2:51:15.800]  Thank you.

[2:53:25.800 --> 2:53:51.800]  Thank you.
[2:53:51.800 --> 2:54:17.800]  Thank you.
[2:54:17.800 --> 2:54:43.800]  Thank you.
[2:54:43.800 --> 2:55:09.800]  Thank you.
[2:55:09.800 --> 2:55:35.800]  Thank you.
[2:55:35.800 --> 2:56:02.800]  Thank you.
[2:56:02.800 --> 2:56:28.800]  Thank you.
[2:56:28.800 --> 2:56:54.800]  Thank you.
[2:56:54.800 --> 2:57:22.800]  Thank you.
[2:57:22.800 --> 2:57:44.800]  Thank you.
