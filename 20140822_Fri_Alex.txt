[00:00.000 --> 00:12.480]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.480 --> 00:21.240]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:21.240 --> 00:30.600]  they're crazy out there and they are rapidly developing a method of blowing
[00:30.600 --> 00:35.520]  up a major US city and people just can't believe that's happening yes it's
[00:35.520 --> 00:41.160]  really significant what's happening that is senator in off of Oklahoma a pretty
[00:41.160 --> 00:47.760]  good guy overall when you talk about establishment Republicans and when he
[00:47.760 --> 00:53.600]  starts talking like that you've got to be really concerned Al Qaeda is real it's
[00:53.600 --> 01:00.320]  renamed itself Isis or is and I don't like to toot my own horn because we're
[01:00.320 --> 01:07.320]  so busy covering the latest news as it breaks but people tend to pay attention
[01:07.320 --> 01:15.120]  to what you say when you can show them a year ago six months ago three years ago
[01:15.120 --> 01:21.080]  saying Al Qaeda in Iraq is being deployed into Syria armed by the NATO
[01:21.080 --> 01:30.720]  forces funded by Saudi Arabia directed by the CIA that was all in foreign
[01:30.720 --> 01:34.160]  newspapers that was all in the Gulf newspapers that was in the Israeli
[01:34.160 --> 01:38.920]  newspapers this is not my opinion remember Rand Paul and Ted Cruz talked
[01:38.920 --> 01:45.080]  about it we shouldn't be Al Qaeda's Air Force and now they're on the news saying
[01:45.080 --> 01:50.720]  we've got to attack Syria because the Syrian civil war has allowed Isis to
[01:50.720 --> 01:56.120]  have a base or Al Qaeda when it's our government and globalist criminals
[01:56.120 --> 02:04.960]  worldwide that started this whole thing to begin with in 1979 and 1983 I have
[02:04.960 --> 02:08.920]  interviewed the Special Forces Commanders and the Army Commanders Colonel
[02:08.920 --> 02:14.600]  Schaefer you name it who publicly ran the programs to kill Al Qaeda leaders and
[02:14.600 --> 02:20.320]  were ordered to stand down twice in the week before 9-11 to kill Osama bin
[02:20.320 --> 02:27.280]  Laden Operation Stratus Ivy by the way I want to get Schaefer on if we can do
[02:27.280 --> 02:32.000]  that I know he has to jump through a lot of hoops to come on because they call
[02:32.000 --> 02:35.960]  him into the Pentagon he still consults and advises to the Army War College and
[02:35.960 --> 02:40.320]  scream at him whenever he comes on but seriously let's twist his arm and get him
[02:40.320 --> 02:47.480]  on the show I want to go take on all of this show it's a real threat they're
[02:47.480 --> 02:51.800]  gonna have the the neocons and fake conservatives write news articles saying
[02:51.800 --> 02:57.040]  that I'm saying Isis doesn't exist when they blow up a sports stadium or blow up
[02:57.040 --> 03:02.680]  a bunch of major skyscrapers where God forbid smuggle a nuclear weapon in
[03:03.400 --> 03:09.280]  that's not what I said I said you funded him you protected him and you're
[03:09.280 --> 03:12.800]  gonna get the blame when it happens you're not gonna shut down the press
[03:12.800 --> 03:19.480]  and take my guns and roll your m-wraps out against the Tea Party because let me
[03:19.480 --> 03:24.000]  tell you something the neocons are manipulating Obama the Democrats and
[03:24.000 --> 03:29.680]  the neocons the highest levels are basically the same cabal and I have
[03:29.680 --> 03:35.520]  told you for years as soon as Al Qaeda is done taking part of Iraq and Syria
[03:35.520 --> 03:40.360]  they're going to rename themselves to confuse the public that I mean they're
[03:40.360 --> 03:44.840]  following like pancake recipe or something this is shaking back it's
[03:44.840 --> 03:52.320]  formulaic and they are going to hit the West and I predict they're gonna start
[03:52.320 --> 03:57.360]  out with surface-to-air missiles with 10,000-foot ceilings shooting
[03:57.360 --> 04:01.720]  airliners down they could deploy these all over Europe and all over the United
[04:01.720 --> 04:05.240]  States and I mean if they've got 15,000 of them they could easily smuggle in
[04:05.240 --> 04:13.360]  hundreds and they could at one time say 901 a.m. Park two miles from every major
[04:13.360 --> 04:20.040]  airport and shoot down a hundred airplanes in one hour you know what
[04:20.040 --> 04:23.320]  happens when a plane's taken off at three or four thousand feet and its engine
[04:23.320 --> 04:28.000]  gets hit by a missile it crashes everybody dies sometimes if one gets hit
[04:28.000 --> 04:32.160]  by a missile at you know 10,000 feet they can get it back to the ground and I've
[04:32.160 --> 04:35.920]  got these ISIS people being allowed to run free all over the country sending us
[04:35.920 --> 04:40.040]  threats you name it they're allowed to operate on Twitter and Facebook but we're
[04:40.040 --> 04:46.560]  not we're censored I tried to put a Rick Perry video out his defense video last
[04:46.560 --> 04:49.680]  night on Facebook and it wasn't letting me well in fact I forgot to give that to

[09:56.280 --> 10:00.920]  told Fox News in Oklahoma City in a detailed sit-down interview that's up
[10:00.920 --> 10:08.920]  on info wars calm present planet calm and drugs report calm he told Fox 25 that
[10:08.920 --> 10:14.880]  ISIS is developing an operation to blow up a major city now that's what they're
[10:14.880 --> 10:18.840]  feeding the senator in the intelligence committee he's a senior senator
[10:18.840 --> 10:23.760]  obviously and has access to all that they're going to be allowed to attack us
[10:23.760 --> 10:28.400]  and it will be bigger than 9-11 my gut tells me it's it's going to be
[10:28.400 --> 10:33.720]  airliners getting shot down buildings being blown up nerve gas being dumped
[10:33.720 --> 10:37.320]  down ventilation shafts on buildings this is the kind of stuff they're working
[10:37.320 --> 10:43.520]  on hell they may even launch a chemical attack and say Chicago or LA or Austin
[10:43.520 --> 10:48.880]  for that matter and blame it on Assad and our media will say Assad did it and
[10:48.880 --> 10:53.840]  it will say he's al-Qaeda they've already been doing that over there and
[10:53.840 --> 10:58.320]  Turkey got caught Saudi Arabia got caught giving them the nerve gas it came
[10:58.320 --> 11:03.880]  out in the UN and the BBC months after we documented it that it was a stage
[11:03.880 --> 11:10.320]  chemical attack to set up a side and I'm got people talking to me on the street
[11:10.320 --> 11:13.800]  and I see it on the news about yeah we didn't take a saw it out so now this is
[11:13.800 --> 11:19.600]  happening yeah we didn't we didn't let Hitler do what he wanted to I mean it's
[11:19.600 --> 11:24.760]  just it's just absolute brainwashing with a public that doesn't even know who
[11:24.760 --> 11:30.760]  the players are al-Qaeda in Iraq four years ago was allowed to set up bases
[11:30.760 --> 11:35.960]  in the west of Iraq and invade eastern Syria they started the civil war four
[11:35.960 --> 11:40.680]  years ago in Syria they were given massive funding their 65% according to
[11:40.680 --> 11:45.200]  NATO of the rebel force the council on farm relations last year had the
[11:45.200 --> 11:50.960]  headline why we need al-Qaeda and they said give them their support to take
[11:50.960 --> 11:57.000]  over the country and we'll remove them later bull Saudi Arabia since 1901
[11:57.000 --> 12:02.240]  officially set up in 1931 but it was established by British intelligence in a
[12:02.240 --> 12:07.200]  multi-hundred square mile area in the middle of the desert giving a radical
[12:07.200 --> 12:13.600]  jihadi group weapons to take over the entire region and set up Saudi Arabia
[12:13.600 --> 12:18.120]  they took over Syria they took over where the old Turkish Empire or the
[12:18.120 --> 12:26.160]  Ottoman Empire collapsed okay so that's a fact but the system thinks you're so
[12:26.160 --> 12:36.560]  dumb that now they can say see we need homeland security and the m-raps they're
[12:36.560 --> 12:39.800]  saying that in the news we need checkpoints and we need total NSA
[12:39.800 --> 12:45.440]  surveillance because ISIS and al-Qaeda and IS all the same group they all have
[12:45.440 --> 12:50.400]  the same flags they say they're al-Qaeda that is just Western names to confuse
[12:50.400 --> 12:57.840]  everyone al-Qaeda has established an Islamic state in eastern Syria and
[12:57.840 --> 13:04.680]  Western Iraq that's a fact to launch attacks worldwide they were given
[13:04.680 --> 13:09.920]  Afghanistan before they've been trying to find a home they've been given the
[13:09.920 --> 13:14.840]  home by NATO and now our military is only bombing them so the public doesn't
[13:14.840 --> 13:19.720]  figure out that our government's behind al-Qaeda and because they've got a paint
[13:19.720 --> 13:23.440]  by the numbers and stay in that area they've been given we have a deal with
[13:23.440 --> 13:30.520]  Iran to give them the east to give the Kurds the north of Iraq and to give IS
[13:30.520 --> 13:38.200]  al-Qaeda in Iraq the Western area that is official that has been out for years
[13:38.200 --> 13:43.840]  that has been the plan to partition Iraq this is all discussed on c-span it's all
[13:43.840 --> 13:47.720]  discussed at the Brookings Institute it's all discussed at the council on
[13:47.720 --> 13:51.360]  foreign relations it's in all the military James weapons quarterly
[13:51.360 --> 13:56.120]  breakdowns anyone who's actually a policy person knows this okay so so
[13:56.120 --> 14:00.440]  understand everyone at the CIA knows all the military brass know even the
[14:00.440 --> 14:03.800]  enlisted know that's why they rebelled last year and said we don't want to bomb
[14:03.800 --> 14:08.840]  Syria for al-Qaeda because al-Qaeda is much worse than Assad we will not
[14:08.840 --> 14:17.720]  morally join with sort on and that was a magic moment for our military
[14:17.720 --> 14:23.880]  rediscovering their morals rediscovering their mission rediscovering the
[14:23.880 --> 14:31.800]  Constitution rediscovering the moral high ground and I wept driving home one
[14:31.800 --> 14:37.760]  day just tears ran down my face of of joy when thousands of military officers
[14:37.760 --> 14:42.000]  Navy Army Marine Corps Air Force would cover their faces in uniform active
[14:42.000 --> 14:47.160]  duty and hold up signs saying I will not fight for al-Qaeda in Syria in fall
[14:47.160 --> 14:51.560]  wars calm under it wasn't even my idea they just did it and then
[14:51.560 --> 14:57.520]  sister and senator Paul and senator Cruz came out and said the same thing and
[14:57.520 --> 15:02.000]  we had a victory in general Dempsey the chairman of the Joint Chiefs went on that
[15:02.000 --> 15:06.800]  Saturday night to the White House at midnight and told Obama the military is
[15:06.800 --> 15:11.520]  going to mutiny if you do this even the top generals say this is immoral we're
[15:11.520 --> 15:15.800]  losing the moral high ground the world's gonna learn that we are helping al-Qaeda
[15:15.800 --> 15:19.760]  you cannot do it
[15:25.880 --> 15:30.560]  and again a lot of them said info wars calm most of them didn't say them for
[15:30.560 --> 15:37.680]  wars calm on their sides but a lot of them did but I mean ladies and gentlemen
[15:37.680 --> 15:45.400]  it's it's not just al-Qaeda in Iraq that's being funded the border since the
[15:45.400 --> 15:50.960]  start of the year eight months has been wide open we were warned about six months
[15:50.960 --> 15:56.400]  ago by the head of the Border Patrol Union the head of the retired Union and
[15:56.400 --> 16:03.960]  a bunch of senior members of their intelligence panel committee roundtable
[16:03.960 --> 16:09.360]  they leaked it all they had federal gag orders put on them the feds are trying
[16:09.360 --> 16:13.840]  to prosecute senior border patrol people saying they violated national security
[16:13.840 --> 16:18.840]  pointing out that they were ordered to it to receive the illegals being bused in
[16:18.840 --> 16:24.960]  take whatever fake ID or no ID and bust them wherever they want thousands of
[16:24.960 --> 16:31.800]  nationals out of Syria Iraq Saudi Arabia Qatar Egypt Pakistan Afghanistan are
[16:31.800 --> 16:38.760]  coming across Chinese workers will work a decade to raise 10 to $30,000 just to
[16:38.760 --> 16:43.840]  get snuck across by a coyotes and the Democratic Party is being paid off large
[16:43.840 --> 16:48.600]  portions of that cash to allow this flood but you put two and two together and
[16:48.600 --> 16:52.800]  it's all coming together and I said this a year ago I said this six months ago I
[16:52.800 --> 16:57.560]  said it last month and I'm getting the worst chills I have ever had right now
[16:57.560 --> 17:05.200]  okay my gut is just in absolutely on fire right now and I have told you hundreds
[17:05.200 --> 17:09.040]  of times exactly what their battle plan is because I can see what they're
[17:09.040 --> 17:11.960]  setting up I could see what they're prescripting in the media get everybody
[17:11.960 --> 17:17.040]  ready for Obama says the number one threat he seizes a nuke going off in
[17:17.040 --> 17:21.160]  Manhattan and he doesn't know who will be behind it in office been told on the
[17:21.160 --> 17:25.560]  intelligence committee that ISIS is preparing to blow up a U.S. city there's
[17:25.560 --> 17:30.800]  crazy out there and they are rapidly developing a method of blowing up a
[17:30.800 --> 17:35.760]  major U.S. city and people just can't believe that's happening yes it's really
[17:35.760 --> 17:43.480]  is significant what's that now all of that's going on the full interviews up
[17:43.480 --> 17:47.760]  on info wars.com senator inhofe warns a political
[17:47.760 --> 17:51.480]  and having a Freudian slips political propaganda senator inhofe warns of
[17:51.480 --> 17:57.360]  potential terrorist attacks on U.S. soil so the borders wide opens they can have
[17:57.360 --> 18:02.240]  plausible deniability Al Qaeda is showing up at the White House with ISIS flags
[18:02.240 --> 18:07.080]  they're sending threats to TV and radio stations there we've been
[18:07.080 --> 18:19.280]  threatened by him ominous tweet connects ISIS threat in Chicago CBS that is the
[18:19.280 --> 18:25.960]  type of stuff that's unfolding here so we are now wide open they are now doing
[18:25.960 --> 18:30.040]  what they did right before 9-11 saying we're about to get hit by Al Qaeda when
[18:30.040 --> 18:34.640]  Al Qaeda hits we got to take all your rights away now repeat back to me we're
[18:34.640 --> 18:38.000]  about to get hit by Al Qaeda we give them all of our rights when they do
[18:38.000 --> 18:43.640]  attack us and it doesn't matter that this group's being funded out of Saudi
[18:43.640 --> 18:47.720]  Arabia again doesn't matter it's being armed to give an intelligence by NATO
[18:47.720 --> 18:52.640]  again it doesn't matter when they hit the United States or Europe you can bet
[18:52.640 --> 18:57.080]  your bottom dollar they will attack an innocent country so they follow the same
[18:57.080 --> 19:01.840]  script Saudi Arabia attacks us on 9-11 we attack Iraq they're our
[19:01.840 --> 19:09.080]  enemy we get attacked by Al Qaeda who's been attacking Syria they when they
[19:09.080 --> 19:14.520]  attack us we will attack Syria who's fighting them you see how that works and
[19:14.520 --> 19:19.040]  by the way that's already proven because you notice now they're saying we
[19:19.040 --> 19:23.560]  got to take a sod out because the civil war going on too long has allowed Al
[19:23.560 --> 19:26.560]  Qaeda to get a foothold when our government gave them the weapons in the
[19:26.560 --> 19:32.880]  foothold that's why I get so mad at people being obsessed with sports because
[19:32.880 --> 19:36.480]  men know all about sports scores all about the facts and things and will
[19:36.480 --> 19:41.600]  argue with each other like it's a military strategy and strategic thinking
[19:41.600 --> 19:47.440]  they have the brain sinners to do that but they know about their their male
[19:47.440 --> 19:54.040]  soap opera of the simulated battle not the real war game going on against all

[24:45.000 --> 24:51.640]  here wringing my hands this is not my opinion go criminal globalist elements
[24:51.640 --> 25:00.360]  are funding and protecting the most nasty form of radical Islam and letting
[25:00.360 --> 25:11.880]  it shut up all over the country and green lighting it to hit the streets and to
[25:11.880 --> 25:17.800]  destabilize the country to then form a clash of civilizations and the average
[25:17.800 --> 25:23.200]  American is so geopolitically ignorant that when the Saudi Arabian funded
[25:23.200 --> 25:32.560]  groups attack this country our military will then crush poor non radical
[25:32.560 --> 25:36.540]  Muslims that wear suits and ties and their women go to college and have
[25:36.540 --> 25:41.720]  freedom we will then blow up their major cities turn them over to Al Qaeda to be
[25:41.720 --> 25:47.000]  murdered in mass 300 plus thousand in four years in Syria killed
[25:47.000 --> 25:53.840]  conservatively well over 50,000 dead in the last few months in Iraq murdered
[25:53.840 --> 26:01.520]  men women children police officers Iraqi army trained by our military good men
[26:01.520 --> 26:07.120]  they're being murdered in our filthy evil government is right in the middle of
[26:07.120 --> 26:13.320]  coordinating a whole thing and that's how stupid they think we are they can get
[26:13.320 --> 26:22.680]  away with basically anything at this point and then when we hear oh we're
[26:22.680 --> 26:29.520]  attacking ISIS sure I I hope ISIS gets blown up but who put them there who
[26:29.520 --> 26:32.480]  protected them they're not they're doing a few bombings of a few trucks and a few
[26:32.480 --> 26:37.200]  artillery pieces and then now baiting and switching as I said they do a few
[26:37.200 --> 26:42.400]  weeks ago to say we've got to take out a sod and I had people this morning coming
[26:42.400 --> 26:47.120]  up to me saying I've been hearing your show about ISIS we need to take them all
[26:47.120 --> 26:53.680]  out of sod to just the mindless primitiveness of this and the guy I
[26:53.680 --> 26:59.600]  was talking to is a successful corporate guy was in military intelligence
[26:59.600 --> 27:04.760]  did CIA work I know in Vietnam is a smart guy but still at a primitive level
[27:04.760 --> 27:11.920]  let's just kill them all but I was at the gym talking to this fellow and I didn't
[27:11.920 --> 27:18.600]  even argue with him it's like yeah I mean let's attack Australia if Al Qaeda
[27:18.600 --> 27:26.120]  had known as IS a taxes and by the way that's not a joke they're using the the
[27:26.120 --> 27:29.360]  terror attacks and the threat of them to take all of our freedoms and behind the
[27:29.360 --> 27:33.080]  scenes homeless Kerry doesn't train to fight radical Muslims or Al Qaeda or
[27:33.080 --> 27:38.720]  IS or ISIS all these names to confuse the sheeple they train to fight who this

[33:08.840 --> 33:28.840]  listening to Alex Jones.
[33:38.840 --> 33:54.520]  Ladies and gentlemen one reason the globalists are so hard to beat is they
[33:54.520 --> 34:02.680]  are so over the top. Saudi Arabia was clearly involved in 9-11 we attack Iraq.
[34:02.680 --> 34:08.560]  Syria is fighting al-Qaeda trying to make deals with Israel for a decade
[34:08.560 --> 34:14.480]  trying to join the West they get attacked by al-Qaeda and now our
[34:14.480 --> 34:20.480]  government saying attack the Syrian government to stop al-Qaeda. That is so
[34:20.480 --> 34:29.200]  criminal and so over the top but it's our military last year and earlier this
[34:29.200 --> 34:36.080]  year that said no to the open Syrian intervention to overthrow Assad who's
[34:36.080 --> 34:42.520]  been democratizing and his secular military. What did our government try to
[34:42.520 --> 34:48.040]  do? They backed overthrowing our ally the secular government Hazy Mubarak 33
[34:48.040 --> 34:57.160]  years in control of Egypt. Now Israel is running around with Netanyahu saying
[34:57.160 --> 35:00.800]  you know ISIS might be a good thing to destabilize the Middle East that's
[35:00.800 --> 35:08.280]  immoral that loses the moral high ground. That's because the West has decided to
[35:08.280 --> 35:13.400]  join with Saudi Arabia and al-Qaeda and to let them take over the whole Middle
[35:13.400 --> 35:17.080]  East. There's another triple cross where they claim they're doubling back with
[35:17.080 --> 35:26.400]  Iran and actually attacking ISIS forces in a deal with Iran. Yes if ISIS gets out
[35:26.400 --> 35:32.400]  of the area they've been given because again they don't fully control ISIS
[35:32.400 --> 35:37.720]  they're just funding them protecting them and turning them loose. Look at this
[35:37.720 --> 35:42.520]  headline right here. Former Homeland Security Advisor and we have the clip
[35:42.520 --> 35:47.280]  coming up very very true ISIS may have crossed the border. What do you make of
[35:47.280 --> 35:53.000]  these reports of ISIS collaborating with Mexican drug cartels to exploit our
[35:53.000 --> 35:59.920]  southern border? Yeah I think that Governor Perry's words are unfortunately
[35:59.920 --> 36:05.120]  very very true. We have seen this administration and the lack of security
[36:05.120 --> 36:11.040]  a lack of policy along the US border but I think more importantly they have
[36:11.040 --> 36:14.640]  really shown this administration's really shown a lack of understanding. They've
[36:14.640 --> 36:20.680]  absolutely underestimated the threat from ISIS. That's Joshua Katz former
[36:20.680 --> 36:26.160]  senior policy advisor to the Senators Intelligence Committee. So this is
[36:26.160 --> 36:29.760]  this is something that the administration that has been known to
[36:29.760 --> 36:34.240]  to all of us for a while. That's good that's from Fox News. So they're all
[36:34.240 --> 36:39.400]  playing dumb now. Oh Obama didn't know. Oh the attacks coming. They're gonna blow up a
[36:39.400 --> 36:45.080]  big city. They are allowing al-Qaeda to come into the country. They are crawling
[36:45.080 --> 36:50.720]  all over us. They are having demonstrations in every US city along
[36:50.720 --> 36:53.600]  with other Muslims that are legitimately concerned about problems in
[36:53.600 --> 36:58.320]  Palestine other issues but in amongst them are the ISIS flags. In amongst them
[36:58.320 --> 37:06.320]  are the Wahhabist jihadis that are funded by Saudi Arabia and NATO and they
[37:06.320 --> 37:10.640]  have turned loose an army. How many times have I said how many hundreds of
[37:10.640 --> 37:14.120]  times that al-Qaeda is the secret army of the New World Order? The
[37:14.120 --> 37:19.640]  destabilizing force worldwide. And now you're seeing it our borders are down
[37:19.640 --> 37:25.400]  they're telling us brace for al-Qaeda ISIS attack. Our government turned them
[37:25.400 --> 37:30.560]  loose protected them set them up when al-Qaeda had been decimated and reduced
[37:30.560 --> 37:36.960]  and now they're back. They're in Ferguson saying ISIS is here and I see all
[37:36.960 --> 37:41.280]  these trendy liberals online cheering on the jihad and cheering on the Arab
[37:41.280 --> 37:46.160]  Spring that was funded by Google and the Ford Foundation and George Soros's
[37:46.160 --> 37:52.800]  open society group publicly. It's part of the global destabilization. If you are
[37:52.800 --> 37:57.760]  a veteran and fought against al-Qaeda in Iraq if you lost a leg or lost a body
[37:57.760 --> 38:05.540]  or got shot I know my cousin has lost so many friends to al-Qaeda and the
[38:05.540 --> 38:08.960]  Akhani network and the rest of them that's why he continues to go back into
[38:08.960 --> 38:19.960]  combat and in the army 31 years 31 years more than 20 tours. It's like 50
[38:19.960 --> 38:24.840]  something years old they got old guys folks where they even understand our
[38:24.840 --> 38:28.280]  government's funding them at a certain level they don't care they want to go
[38:28.280 --> 38:32.680]  fight these guys because they've killed their buddies.
[38:32.680 --> 38:41.960]  This is so sick how they manipulate our own tribalism I want to hear from active
[38:41.960 --> 38:45.820]  duty but also people that have been victims of al-Qaeda is it not clear
[38:45.820 --> 38:49.960]  what's happening how we're being set up al-Qaeda is being led into attack as the
[38:49.960 --> 38:54.320]  political diversion so martial law can come into place they're saying a whole
[38:54.320 --> 39:01.120]  city could be blown up that means a nuke and you've got Obama saying my main
[39:01.120 --> 39:07.000]  fear is a nuke going off in New York let's get that clip if we can and then
[39:07.000 --> 39:10.520]  you've got missing nukes from Dias Air Force Base that weren't even supposed
[39:10.520 --> 39:15.200]  to be there we had this from high level witnesses that saw it high level that's
[39:15.200 --> 39:18.960]  all I'm gonna say who physically went out and stopped the trucks coming off
[39:18.960 --> 39:23.120]  so you got to have paperwork and the base commander came out and said here's
[39:23.120 --> 39:29.040]  the paperwork it's ordered by the president now get out of the way there
[39:29.040 --> 39:33.640]  was a confrontation
[39:39.160 --> 39:47.640]  this happened and then within 24 hours senator Lindsey Graham was running
[39:47.640 --> 39:51.840]  around on the intelligence committee on CBS News saying brace for nuclear bombs
[39:51.840 --> 40:02.480]  to go off in the Carolinas and in New York City if we don't take down Assad al-Qaeda
[40:02.480 --> 40:07.160]  will hit us Assad's fighting al-Qaeda so so you can see him putting the narrative
[40:07.160 --> 40:11.360]  out that makes no sense why would we be nuke by al-Qaeda if we didn't take out
[40:11.360 --> 40:19.000]  Assad or was there a deal is it gonna be criminal elements the Democratic Party
[40:19.000 --> 40:23.560]  that shut off a nuke is it gonna be a foreign power is it gonna be ISIS
[40:23.560 --> 40:28.200]  themselves I don't know but I can see the total setup for plausible
[40:28.200 --> 40:33.840]  deniability going on right now and notice we were saying this before there
[40:33.840 --> 40:39.640]  was any evidence of it because I could see the programming in the media the
[40:39.640 --> 40:45.360]  preparations the digging in and so we get hit a major city goes up in flames
[40:45.360 --> 40:50.880]  there's only one thing that can take out a whole city one thing man-made that
[40:50.880 --> 40:55.880]  will take out a whole city and that's an atomic or hydrogen bomb
[40:59.120 --> 41:04.320]  member Obama about a month after I said there was missing nukes and we had
[41:04.320 --> 41:09.680]  missing nukes from my aunt North Dakota in 2007 that showed up at the Air Force
[41:09.680 --> 41:15.240]  base in Louisiana and I remember that was in the Liberty based media days
[41:15.240 --> 41:18.720]  before it broke it was a quo conspiracy theory and then they killed a bunch of
[41:18.720 --> 41:21.640]  people at the base that witnessed what went on they were trying to disappear
[41:21.640 --> 41:27.880]  and ship cruise missiles to the Middle East loaded with high-tech hydrogen
[41:27.880 --> 41:36.280]  bombs hydrogen warheads there's a bunch of weird stuff going on folks and
[41:36.280 --> 41:40.720]  everybody better have their eyes open toll free number to join us for police
[41:40.720 --> 41:46.960]  military you name it you guys let me know when you have that Obama clip 800
[41:46.960 --> 41:59.280]  259 9231 800 259 9231 is there any other way to see what's happening here how
[41:59.280 --> 42:02.720]  do you take down America of your globalist criminals you fund radical
[42:02.720 --> 42:06.520]  terrorists to attack the country you use that terror attack as the pretext to
[42:06.520 --> 42:11.680]  bring in martial law while the true training of the NATO and North com
[42:11.680 --> 42:17.400]  military this is Forbes magazine Associated Press Reuters Washington post
[42:17.400 --> 42:22.720]  is to have a war with the Patriots who follow the Constitution Bill of Rights
[42:22.720 --> 42:32.320]  and are Americans there is no way to debate what's happening 800 259
[42:32.320 --> 42:41.680]  9231 let's go to Garrett in Texas a former Marine what is this like for you
[42:41.680 --> 42:45.080]  to see this unfolding and do you disagree with anything I've said or do you
[42:45.080 --> 42:50.680]  want to add something yes I agree yes I'd like to add this is the twilight
[42:50.680 --> 42:54.960]  zone when I joined the Marine Corps and the training we went through I was in
[42:54.960 --> 43:02.080]  security forces at a nuclear arms base up in Seattle Washington it's it's
[43:02.080 --> 43:06.920]  almost like I had this feeling the whole time that they're building up for
[43:06.920 --> 43:11.280]  something and what is it and it's not what they're telling us but the that the
[43:11.280 --> 43:15.280]  whole another issue I'd really like to get on to the point of immigration and
[43:15.280 --> 43:18.280]  then all the false flags that they're setting and basically them getting
[43:18.280 --> 43:22.800]  ready for what appears to be civil war yes I'm sure you're aware of what
[43:22.800 --> 43:26.960]  happens at Qatar in Saudi Arabia the way that they ship and basically their
[43:26.960 --> 43:31.160]  immigration force from the surrounding countries and they basically enslave them
[43:31.160 --> 43:34.640]  by these contracts and they have them living on compounds and they're
[43:34.640 --> 43:38.400]  building their new empire over there but they're doing the same exact thing I
[43:38.400 --> 43:42.440]  personally believe with the poor immigrants that are coming from I
[43:42.440 --> 43:46.800]  totally agree they are setting up work compounds and will exploit them but it's
[43:46.800 --> 43:50.560]  not just about exploiting them it's about exploiting everyone else using
[43:50.560 --> 43:55.360]  them to drive down the wages you import the third-world slave population to do
[43:55.360 --> 44:00.280]  that it's it's a three-pronged spirit to try it in and it's they're killing
[44:00.280 --> 44:05.480]  10,000 birds with one stone and now once we start to pay attention to that here
[44:05.480 --> 44:09.120]  comes the distraction they they were planning on just paying attention to
[44:09.120 --> 44:12.440]  the news waiting for a new story to come up they I mean they've obviously been
[44:12.440 --> 44:15.440]  trying to get this race war going that's gonna be the tip of the spear and
[44:15.440 --> 44:19.440]  then from that it's gonna be patriots versus it's kind of like the chaos of
[44:19.440 --> 44:25.440]  the of the the protests that are going on now and the chaos of the 99% movement
[44:25.440 --> 44:30.400]  how it all gets infiltrated it becomes chaos and then Al Qaeda hits and they say
[44:30.400 --> 44:34.520]  well Homeland Security was busy dealing with riots the nuke went off in Chicago
[44:34.520 --> 44:40.320]  or the nuke went off in Manhattan and they will do it and totally take over
[44:40.320 --> 44:44.600]  and you can that's why they don't care if you know they stole the pension funds
[44:44.600 --> 44:47.960]  it's why they don't care if you know they're devaluing the dollar it's why
[44:47.960 --> 44:51.640]  they don't care and go on the news and say your kids belong to the state it's
[44:51.640 --> 44:56.600]  why they don't care and say two plus two equals five because everything they do
[44:56.600 --> 45:00.840]  with their body language it's like bank robbers that have already shot three
[45:00.840 --> 45:04.200]  cops they're the most dangerous because they're gonna kill ten more they have
[45:04.200 --> 45:11.000]  nothing to lose they are going all out bonker land on the news saying attack
[45:11.000 --> 45:18.360]  Assad to stop ISIS when that's who he's fighting that's how dumb they think we
[45:18.360 --> 45:26.720]  are I mean it is it is Twilight Zone it is over the top bonker land well I'll
[45:26.720 --> 45:30.640]  tell you what my uh my adrenaline is rushing because of how important this
[45:30.640 --> 45:34.720]  is you talk about the oh you can feel it can't you anybody anybody who's got
[45:34.720 --> 45:37.920]  their headscrewed on straight can see they're they're dropping the hammer man
[45:37.920 --> 45:42.600]  this is the beginning of the end of this country well I'll tell you what I'll
[45:42.600 --> 45:45.640]  tell you what most people in the military they're either completely it's just
[45:45.640 --> 45:48.920]  like normal society they're either completely awake or they don't have a
[45:48.920 --> 45:53.600]  clue and you know most of the people that are awake unfortunately you know
[45:53.600 --> 45:57.600]  they've got us kind of pinned down they they know who we are they've been they're
[45:57.600 --> 46:02.280]  ready for us but I just really really hope enough people like at the end of the
[46:02.280 --> 46:06.320]  Lego movie is lame as it sounds if the bad guys just decide they want to be the
[46:06.320 --> 46:10.640]  good guys and give up on this we have a chance and I and I hope at least Texas
[46:10.640 --> 46:15.400]  will be a shining city on the hill even if America falls that the people of
[46:15.400 --> 46:19.320]  Texas will stand up for liberty and and freedom why do you think they've just
[46:19.320 --> 46:24.720]  indicted Rick Perry because Rick Perry and I've talked to state senators on air
[46:24.720 --> 46:28.920]  a few years ago about the secret plan that Rick Perry had to basically set up
[46:28.920 --> 46:32.040]  martial law on the border to stop a collapse of Mexico because it would
[46:32.040 --> 46:36.320]  totally ruin the state of Mexico collapsed into Texas the plan is to not
[46:36.320 --> 46:40.160]  let Mexico collapse into California but to let it collapse into Republican
[46:40.160 --> 46:44.400]  states to then make them go blue or socialist and I'm not even a Republican
[46:44.400 --> 46:48.440]  but you can see the strategic plan and how bad it is and then everything they
[46:48.440 --> 46:52.680]  said Rick Perry then implemented and then I was basically given the word that
[46:52.680 --> 46:58.000]  no Rick Perry and I don't know this is true but we see evidence of it is getting
[46:58.000 --> 47:04.560]  ready to double cross the globalist and then he gets indicted and so you put all
[47:04.560 --> 47:07.920]  of it together look they're inditing other Republican governors they're
[47:07.920 --> 47:11.800]  arresting them for Virginia you name it for nothing they're resting in that
[47:11.800 --> 47:15.520]  suzer they're arresting literally hundreds of tea party people with fake
[47:15.520 --> 47:19.080]  IRS charges I mean they're not just auditing them they're then doing
[47:19.080 --> 47:23.360]  criminal charges on made-up stuff that I mean they're they're doing things that
[47:23.360 --> 47:26.800]  have never happened in this country and that's what I keep warning people about
[47:26.800 --> 47:32.840]  this is hardcore and I'm not trying to scare people with the truth I'm trying
[47:32.840 --> 47:37.120]  to get people active to realize that this is happening our only hope is saying
[47:37.120 --> 47:43.080]  no and calling it out and I'm going to tell the police and military again when
[47:43.080 --> 47:46.760]  the newt goes off they may blame it on the tea party or al-qaeda they're so
[47:46.760 --> 47:51.840]  bold that's why they had a army war games a few years ago or quote the tea
[47:51.840 --> 47:56.080]  party joins with al-qaeda now everybody knows that the tea party is
[47:56.080 --> 48:02.240]  completely Islamophobic on average and is totally warmongering against the
[48:02.240 --> 48:05.680]  Middle East they don't differentiate it's one of their only faults in my view
[48:05.680 --> 48:11.160]  that is literally like saying Superman works for Lex Luthor or that Martin
[48:11.160 --> 48:15.640]  Luther King was a grand dragon but it doesn't matter they'll say the tea
[48:15.640 --> 48:20.360]  party works with al-qaeda that's I mean look they teach the army at Fort Hood
[48:20.360 --> 48:25.200]  that George Washington wouldn't be welcomed in today's army George Washington
[48:25.200 --> 48:31.560]  founded the US Army people say that's over the top saying you didn't build
[48:31.560 --> 48:36.200]  your businesses over the top they are they are they are they are change agents
[48:36.200 --> 48:41.040]  folks totally frying everybody for a total takeover I'm gonna go to I
[48:41.040 --> 48:44.200]  appreciate your call I just I just look I'm telling you folks the reason I'm
[48:44.200 --> 48:48.560]  freaking out on every day now is because we got a chance to stop this and when
[48:48.560 --> 48:52.320]  the globalists take over they're gonna come after everybody they're gonna
[48:52.320 --> 48:58.200]  definitely set me up where'd Alex go oh he didn't pass taxes or he bounced the
[48:58.200 --> 49:03.880]  checker you know he pulled a gun on cops and it'll be an embedded intelligence

[49:18.600 --> 49:23.040]  it so good for so long we're like Native Americans that never ran into smallpox
[49:23.040 --> 49:27.080]  so it would kill 95% of them and only 5% of Europeans would die from it because
[49:27.080 --> 49:31.120]  all the Europeans would die before it already died so people had genetic
[49:31.120 --> 49:35.040]  immunity we politically do not have a history of real tyranny compared to
[49:35.040 --> 49:43.280]  other nations so we're wide open to it I want to let everybody know that this

[53:01.720 --> 53:05.880]  you about Matt Redhawk and his team of patriots over at my Patriots supply
[53:05.880 --> 53:09.880]  several years ago Matt was sitting in his two bedroom apartment frustrated with

[55:20.040 --> 55:27.200]  don't know but they're using drug cartels use the same operational plan as

[01:00:40.120 --> 01:00:44.640]  ISIS is taking more houses just killed 50 plus people today blowing up a
[01:00:44.640 --> 01:00:48.960]  peaceful mosque and our government says they want to attack Syria that's fighting
[01:00:48.960 --> 01:00:52.600]  the very same Al Qaeda group they say that will that will defeat them is to
[01:00:52.600 --> 01:00:56.920]  is to overthrow the government they're fighting so it's getting twilight zone
[01:00:56.920 --> 01:01:02.440]  weird we're having open phones today wide open phones now on any of the issues
[01:01:02.440 --> 01:01:06.440]  we've raised the dollar being devalued on purpose the police state what's
[01:01:06.440 --> 01:01:09.880]  happening with ISIS what do you think should be done obviously there are
[01:01:09.880 --> 01:01:14.640]  horribly unsavory demonic group but our government put them in place prepared
[01:01:14.640 --> 01:01:19.480]  them to be able to infiltrate the whole world and I've been predicting then
[01:01:19.480 --> 01:01:23.520]  attack the West which is what the political class wants because then
[01:01:23.520 --> 01:01:26.800]  they'll take all of our liberties build up a homeland security force the
[01:01:26.800 --> 01:01:31.760]  domestic army pointed at the Tea Party which is what you now see happening
[01:01:31.760 --> 01:01:38.680]  openly again it's a criminal globalist class using other criminal groups as the
[01:01:38.680 --> 01:01:43.360]  pretext to take all of our freedoms John in Montana former army what's your
[01:01:43.360 --> 01:01:49.480]  breakdown on this yes hi Alex my take on this whole blowing up a city thing is
[01:01:49.480 --> 01:01:53.960]  this these guys are agenda 21 they want to do this environmentally friendly I
[01:01:53.960 --> 01:02:00.120]  think so I'm thinking maybe orbital tungsten drop rods popular mechanics
[01:02:00.120 --> 01:02:05.160]  didn't article on this I believe in 2005 and all these ISIS people can knock
[01:02:05.160 --> 01:02:11.760]  out power relays cell phone towers so the area around the city can't
[01:02:11.760 --> 01:02:17.080]  communicate out and then I just go in there and mop up they go ahead and blow
[01:02:17.080 --> 01:02:21.440]  up something like I don't know barium then they go ahead and they can't show
[01:02:21.440 --> 01:02:25.280]  the bodies to anybody the bodies that have probably been shot the survivors of
[01:02:25.280 --> 01:02:32.160]  this drop rod and they have their neat little package and whatever cover story
[01:02:32.160 --> 01:02:37.360]  they want that's the exact type of asymmetrical warfare operation they
[01:02:37.360 --> 01:02:40.920]  could launch or they can be given a suitcase nuke and then blaming on the
[01:02:40.920 --> 01:02:44.640]  Russians anything's possible but they're getting us ready we're gonna be hit by
[01:02:44.640 --> 01:02:47.920]  nukes give up all your rights when the newt goes off in fact I keep forgetting
[01:02:47.920 --> 01:02:53.240]  to play it we have the clip of Obama was it three four months ago saying the
[01:02:53.240 --> 01:02:58.160]  number one thing he fears isn't is a nuke going off a mushroom cloud in New
[01:02:58.160 --> 01:03:03.120]  York City so he opens the borders up while al Qaeda that our government's
[01:03:03.120 --> 01:03:07.240]  armed ISIS is saying we're gonna come across our border and we're and they're
[01:03:07.240 --> 01:03:10.720]  coming to America they were in Libya they said we're going to Egypt and Syria
[01:03:10.720 --> 01:03:14.920]  next and Iraq they went there then they said we're coming to Europe and America
[01:03:14.920 --> 01:03:20.280]  we're gonna cut your heads off we're gonna take over the White House and then
[01:03:20.280 --> 01:03:26.000]  they're allowed to operate and then they use the public's call to bomb them I'm
[01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:29.120]  never for these wars but I'm for bombing al Qaeda and their convoys and
[01:03:29.120 --> 01:03:32.720]  they're running around murdering Christians but you notice now that's not
[01:03:32.720 --> 01:03:37.160]  happening let's go to that Obama clip here it is when it comes to our security
[01:03:37.160 --> 01:03:43.880]  with the prospect of a nuclear weapon going off in Manhattan which is part of
[01:03:43.880 --> 01:03:49.480]  the reason why the United States showing its continued international
[01:03:49.480 --> 01:03:54.360]  leadership has organized a forum over the last several years that's been able
[01:03:54.360 --> 01:04:00.960]  to help eliminate that threat in a consistent way now there are argument
[01:04:00.960 --> 01:04:05.400]  in a Nietzschean way this will they tell higher-level people who are involved
[01:04:05.400 --> 01:04:10.200]  in helping smuggle things in they go we're doing this with survival of the
[01:04:10.200 --> 01:04:14.120]  fittest to simulate attacks on America so that America will stand up and be
[01:04:14.120 --> 01:04:18.000]  strong that's why we're gonna let al Qaeda hit us so we have a rightful place
[01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:23.000]  in the world to maintain order but it's not even maintaining order they want to
[01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:27.040]  teach our kids 2 plus 2 equals 5 the ruling elite want to dump everybody
[01:04:27.040 --> 01:04:34.000]  down they're not good even their cover stories a fraud anything else John yeah
[01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:39.000]  well with whatever newt they want to use they've got the individual markers in
[01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:43.240]  them so whatever the enemy of the week is they can go ahead and say we'll use
[01:04:43.240 --> 01:04:47.360]  that newt blow up whatever city and there you go we have an attack on
[01:04:47.360 --> 01:04:50.680]  whatever enemy of the week we have that's right they jacket it with different
[01:04:50.680 --> 01:04:55.880]  coatings of metal to then have the fingerprint of the weapon perfect to
[01:04:55.880 --> 01:05:01.560]  set up whoever they want to demonize another major health threat this one in

[01:09:09.880 --> 01:09:16.000]  it last year and got upset so they renamed it is and now they want is to
[01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:20.320]  hit us because then homeland security can grandstand and say see we need the
[01:09:20.320 --> 01:09:25.180]  NSA to spy on you even though the NSA won't stop the attack watch just like
[01:09:25.180 --> 01:09:31.120]  9-11 they were spy on everything didn't stop anything and just like 9-11 when Saudi Arabia is
[01:09:31.120 --> 01:09:35.120]  part of the group that attacked us and the door was open for them we will then
[01:09:35.120 --> 01:09:40.440]  attack Syria this time just like we attacked Iraq last time and just like
[01:09:40.440 --> 01:09:46.880]  Homeland Security now according to even before Bush left office but it went
[01:09:46.880 --> 01:09:52.080]  into overdrive when Obama got in seven years ago that a Homeland Security 90
[01:09:52.080 --> 01:09:56.640]  plus percent of it is spent on the Liberty movement veterans gun owners the
[01:09:56.640 --> 01:10:03.080]  Tea Party this whole thing is to suppress the American people so the
[01:10:03.080 --> 01:10:08.240]  criminal political class can rob us seven ways to Sunday and convert us to a
[01:10:08.240 --> 01:10:14.800]  total banana Republic U.S. Army to be used against in insurrectionist Tea Party
[01:10:14.800 --> 01:10:19.440]  that is in the Army manuals look it up in full-spectrum operations in the
[01:10:19.440 --> 01:10:26.800]  homeland a vision of the future for the Army War College and also there's

[01:11:20.760 --> 01:11:25.320]  intervention using ISIS pretext and then up in the tiles and the other news
[01:11:25.320 --> 01:11:32.440]  area below the top news area of info wars.com we have the Fox 25 video of
[01:11:32.440 --> 01:11:38.120]  Senator Inhofe talking about a U.S. city being destroyed but first Obama three
[01:11:38.120 --> 01:11:45.480]  months ago saying the main threat is a nuke going off in New York City boy wooden
[01:11:45.480 --> 01:11:50.800]  homeland security love that they could totally take over society they're all
[01:11:50.800 --> 01:11:54.760]  lined up they're already doing it but they want to shut everything down they've
[01:11:54.760 --> 01:11:59.480]  got the radio TV EAS takeover systems in they got the checkpoints set up the
[01:11:59.480 --> 01:12:04.640]  armored vehicles ready the FEMA camps activated the border is imploded just
[01:12:04.640 --> 01:12:10.120]  destabilizing the whole world this is their plan clowered in heaven agenda 21
[01:12:10.120 --> 01:12:17.760]  let's go to that clip when it comes to our security with the prospect of a
[01:12:17.760 --> 01:12:23.600]  nuclear weapon going off in Manhattan which is part of the reason why the
[01:12:23.600 --> 01:12:29.560]  United States showing its continued international leadership has organized a
[01:12:29.560 --> 01:12:34.720]  forum over the last several years that's been able to help eliminate that
[01:12:34.720 --> 01:12:38.920]  threat in a consistent way now four weeks ago the White House put out a
[01:12:38.920 --> 01:12:43.840]  statement saying the world has seen unprecedented tranquility and stability
[01:12:43.840 --> 01:12:50.480]  under the global leadership of Barack Hussein Obama known as our savior
[01:12:50.480 --> 01:12:57.360]  according to Jamie Fox not according to me but last week Hagel the Secretary of
[01:12:57.360 --> 01:13:01.200]  Defense came out and said the whole world is quote blowing up and I agree
[01:13:01.200 --> 01:13:04.880]  with that and you know who the wily coyote is rampant the bombs pushing the
[01:13:04.880 --> 01:13:10.760]  plungers our government George Soros the globalist NATO is running around giving
[01:13:10.760 --> 01:13:15.840]  weapons every radical group whether they be Nazis right-wing nationalist in
[01:13:15.840 --> 01:13:22.360]  Ukraine whether it be jihadis of any stripe I mean this is bad and only
[01:13:22.360 --> 01:13:28.800]  public ignorance of geopolitical factors and the players is causing this I'm
[01:13:28.800 --> 01:13:34.520]  going to your calls but I don't want to hear from men out there anymore and
[01:13:34.520 --> 01:13:40.240]  women that you can't figure this out you say you can figure out all the sitcom
[01:13:40.240 --> 01:13:45.480]  people all the vampire movie people guys can figure out all the sports scores
[01:13:45.480 --> 01:13:50.240]  and you know guys will walk up to each other at the gym or an elevator or I'll
[01:13:50.240 --> 01:13:54.520]  hear guys at a restaurant arguing for like an hour with stats throwing them
[01:13:54.520 --> 01:13:57.640]  out well this team's got that and this team's got this and we've got weapons
[01:13:57.640 --> 01:14:03.440]  and repeating everything from the of the war channel ESPN where men are
[01:14:03.440 --> 01:14:08.960]  arrested in their development all day watching other men all excited showing
[01:14:08.960 --> 01:14:14.760]  militant militarized planning about simulated warfare games little boys
[01:14:14.760 --> 01:14:21.600]  playing games little boys playing fantasy football and I'm not judging you if
[01:14:21.600 --> 01:14:25.240]  you like to go watch a basketball game or football game or baseball game or do
[01:14:25.240 --> 01:14:30.080]  you like the Olympics I like watching you know the sprinters I like watching a
[01:14:30.080 --> 01:14:36.040]  good football game and overtime but man I will not use my brain space on knowing
[01:14:36.040 --> 01:14:40.040]  all the fact toys a lot of guys are like man you're not very manly that's right
[01:14:40.040 --> 01:14:45.520]  I like to know about almost every country I can their basic history how they
[01:14:45.520 --> 01:14:50.040]  interconnect with each other who what group is behind what historically the
[01:14:50.040 --> 01:14:54.560]  old beefs how the globalists are manipulating that using sociology
[01:14:54.560 --> 01:15:02.720]  anthropology psychology archetypal union psychology full spectrum dominance
[01:15:02.720 --> 01:15:07.600]  the eugenics based global plan the technocracy the breakaway civilization
[01:15:07.600 --> 01:15:12.800]  system has already been developed how far advanced that breakaway civilization
[01:15:12.800 --> 01:15:19.080]  is it may be more than we know fact it probably is more than we even know 30
[01:15:19.080 --> 01:15:27.280]  years advanced these are epic giant issues so I'm almost as manly as some
[01:15:27.280 --> 01:15:32.400]  guy that can spout off all the football statistics and it'll bug his eyes out at
[01:15:32.400 --> 01:15:35.240]  you when you're walking through the store and want you to get out of his way
[01:15:35.240 --> 01:15:41.800]  because he's bigger than you are see I'm not trying to act tough and manly I'm
[01:15:41.800 --> 01:15:47.080]  trying to be a man and build a future for my family I'm trying to navigate all
[01:15:47.080 --> 01:15:51.960]  the primitive manipulation and garbage to not be a primitive to advance to the
[01:15:51.960 --> 01:15:57.680]  next level and try to save civilization I'm not afraid of the big muscle-bound
[01:15:57.680 --> 01:16:03.400]  guy I'm afraid I'll bash his brains out all over the ground and I don't want to
[01:16:03.400 --> 01:16:12.200]  do that I want him to grow up and be a man and try to save the Republic that's
[01:16:12.200 --> 01:16:15.120]  what we're talking about here ladies and gentlemen is not being fake macho
[01:16:15.120 --> 01:16:19.760]  idiots but actually learning the facts being men learning how the world really
[01:16:19.760 --> 01:16:23.760]  works and saying no to it learning how they game the economy you by the way
[01:16:23.760 --> 01:16:27.920]  even if you're a cynical mercenary do you know how much money you can make with
[01:16:27.920 --> 01:16:31.400]  the knowledge of how the stock market really works and with the knowledge of
[01:16:31.400 --> 01:16:37.320]  how markets really work I mean I generally and people know this is true
[01:16:37.320 --> 01:16:41.760]  can predict markets you name it months or years in advance knowing how the
[01:16:41.760 --> 01:16:46.400]  globalist operate you imagine if I just wanted to spend my time making money off
[01:16:46.400 --> 01:16:55.640]  those ideas and I'm not bragging I'm a regular guy who clicked archetypally to
[01:16:55.640 --> 01:16:59.840]  actually becoming informed about geopolitics and history all because I
[01:16:59.840 --> 01:17:03.000]  read history books as a child and learned how the world really worked and
[01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:07.480]  found out how exciting and dynamic it was and decided that I didn't want to be
[01:17:07.480 --> 01:17:13.560]  a passive nobody who didn't exist and who was just a spectator who was
[01:17:13.560 --> 01:17:20.080]  programmed for my entire life I want to live I want to control my destiny I want
[01:17:20.080 --> 01:17:26.480]  to be honorable I want to return chivalry I want to return exploration and
[01:17:26.480 --> 01:17:31.480]  trailblazing and invention I want space colonies I want honorable
[01:17:31.480 --> 01:17:36.760]  transparency and government I want to go to the next level and I know you do as
[01:17:36.760 --> 01:17:41.160]  well you will not go to the next level knowing about the football scores you
[01:17:41.160 --> 01:17:45.440]  will go to the next level learning about the history of Ukraine learning about
[01:17:45.440 --> 01:17:50.880]  the history of the South learning about the history of New York learning about
[01:17:50.880 --> 01:17:55.240]  quantum mechanics learning about what makes the globalist tick because when
[01:17:55.240 --> 01:18:00.640]  you study the globalist you find out these people are the most wicked cold
[01:18:00.640 --> 01:18:05.520]  unhuman people you can imagine who have decided to use all this knowledge that
[01:18:05.520 --> 01:18:09.840]  can be used to empower humanity to annihilate humanity Brian and Arizona

[01:24:10.360 --> 01:24:14.960]  geopolitical global destabilization by the mega banks that's is behind it all
[01:24:14.960 --> 01:24:19.640]  they've disarmed people worldwide they're breaking up families worldwide they want
[01:24:19.640 --> 01:24:24.160]  the dumb down or populations they've got big robot factories producing the
[01:24:24.160 --> 01:24:28.280]  robots to replace most the Chinese workforce the US workforce the French
[01:24:28.280 --> 01:24:32.440]  workforce and you could say well humanity's ugly there's too many of us
[01:24:32.440 --> 01:24:35.800]  and go along with that argument the point is you're being targeted to and
[01:24:35.800 --> 01:24:39.920]  they've decided to destabilize the country and bring in the national
[01:24:39.920 --> 01:24:44.940]  stabilization force so we're talking to Brian in Arizona about the runners the
[01:24:44.940 --> 01:24:48.600]  hiders and the fighters and he was saying I guess he's talking to his folks
[01:24:48.600 --> 01:24:52.400]  that are still in the military officers and they're talking about all this that's
[01:24:52.400 --> 01:24:56.600]  going on I'll continue you were talking about the fighters they've got
[01:24:56.600 --> 01:25:03.160]  militarized police locally they've got the hiders please continue yeah the
[01:25:03.160 --> 01:25:06.920]  hiders you know they're doing silly things like it's illegal to plant a
[01:25:06.920 --> 01:25:12.560]  garden over a certain size in your backyard you know those people that are
[01:25:12.560 --> 01:25:18.680]  going to hunker down you know Arizona we we have the you know a lot of people
[01:25:18.680 --> 01:25:23.520]  you know our gun owners here so it's not going to be the first state to fall
[01:25:23.520 --> 01:25:28.760]  for sure but you know everything you say is coming true you know watching this
[01:25:28.760 --> 01:25:35.680]  this you know false flag race war they're putting on is ridiculous I've
[01:25:35.680 --> 01:25:40.640]  watched a lot of the YouTube stuff I asked a buddy of mine former classmate
[01:25:40.640 --> 01:25:46.520]  very high-level staff off the air I'd be glad to tell you exactly who it is and
[01:25:46.520 --> 01:25:52.240]  what my source is but this guy I asked him I said he's fever camps for real I
[01:25:52.240 --> 01:25:57.080]  mean and he asked me a question he says if he says we have a hundred million
[01:25:57.080 --> 01:26:04.240]  people on some for some form of subsistence you know welfare food stamps
[01:26:04.240 --> 01:26:08.640]  he says when the government checks stop he says what do you think these cities
[01:26:08.640 --> 01:26:14.160]  are going to look like he says what are you going to do with the people that's
[01:26:14.160 --> 01:26:17.680]  what the camps are made for they're going to put all these people you know
[01:26:17.680 --> 01:26:23.520]  these people in inner cities they don't stock water food you know we save beans
[01:26:23.520 --> 01:26:27.760]  bullets and band-aids that's what you got to stock you got to have a bug out
[01:26:27.760 --> 01:26:34.960]  planned and you got to be ready to expand on that you can look at the hundred
[01:26:34.960 --> 01:26:38.040]  million people on welfare and how destabilized things are and say oh see
[01:26:38.040 --> 01:26:43.160]  this is reasonable but it was all maneuvered for decades towards this
[01:26:43.160 --> 01:26:51.600]  point and during the chaos the system is training to take on Americans that
[01:26:51.600 --> 01:26:57.000]  will fight communism and socialism as the new political system to come out of
[01:26:57.000 --> 01:27:02.200]  the collapse they plan to target us shut us up as the counter-revolutionaries in
[01:27:02.200 --> 01:27:06.920]  their own words this is from Bill Ayers all of them this is the doctrine of the
[01:27:06.920 --> 01:27:11.880]  attorney general to then bring us out with wealth redistribution and socialism
[01:27:11.880 --> 01:27:18.600]  on the other side and so it is just a nightmare scenario and I hope that your
[01:27:18.600 --> 01:27:23.800]  high-level source I hope you can talk to him again and ask them are they aware
[01:27:23.800 --> 01:27:29.920]  of that and surely there they know that almost all the training is to target
[01:27:29.920 --> 01:27:35.280]  what you just said the hiders the people that are self-sufficient I mean look at
[01:27:35.280 --> 01:27:40.400]  all the movies how they demonize anybody who wants to be self-sufficient and who
[01:27:40.400 --> 01:27:47.560]  is in any way a fan of freedom what's your take on that well they've trained
[01:27:47.560 --> 01:27:53.200]  all of our sons to go over there in Iraq and Syria and other places and they've
[01:27:53.200 --> 01:27:59.400]  done knocking talks with you know and seized weapons and and interrogated
[01:27:59.400 --> 01:28:06.360]  people and these young Marines and army guys are are good at it and Homeland
[01:28:06.360 --> 01:28:11.560]  Security made a mistake okay when they announced that one of the enemies is
[01:28:11.560 --> 01:28:18.800]  returning veterans and then right after that there there's a kill list for these
[01:28:18.800 --> 01:28:22.560]  guys they're poisoning these guys are putting them on on ten different
[01:28:22.560 --> 01:28:26.560]  medications these guys just want to serve their country they just want to come
[01:28:26.560 --> 01:28:30.520]  back get an education and the next thing you know they're so whacked out on
[01:28:30.520 --> 01:28:36.280]  dozen different drugs and that's their plan they want to poison these guys they
[01:28:36.280 --> 01:28:41.840]  want to kill them because they're a threat because these guys are gonna be
[01:28:41.840 --> 01:28:45.280]  what we're gonna need the Patriots are gonna need these guys with that are
[01:28:45.280 --> 01:28:50.160]  highly trained and that can mobilize your neighborhood groups well well Joe
[01:28:50.160 --> 01:28:56.680]  Biggs was in you know heavy combat army units in Afghanistan they would order
[01:28:56.680 --> 01:29:06.080]  them to take opiates painkillers for no reason and said oh you're under stress
[01:29:06.080 --> 01:29:10.320]  just to get them addicted so they could then declare them with some type of
[01:29:10.320 --> 01:29:16.720]  mental issue at the end of it and so you can see how much they hate humans how
[01:29:16.720 --> 01:29:20.400]  much the globalist hate soldiers and warriors just like they won't be around
[01:29:20.400 --> 01:29:23.760]  any of the troops when they're armed because you know they want robots and
[01:29:23.760 --> 01:29:28.320]  that's the next phase so while they've still got to use humans they are setting
[01:29:28.320 --> 01:29:33.320]  you up with the vaccines the drugs all of it when you get out really good
[01:29:33.320 --> 01:29:40.320]  points Brian if you want to offer talk to John Harman is it that he's on the

[01:33:48.200 --> 01:33:52.320]  Gates Foundation paid you can pull up mainstream news articles times of India
[01:33:52.320 --> 01:34:00.720]  you name it to forcibly inoculate the government there makes them do it the
[01:34:00.720 --> 01:34:10.880]  entire country with polio vaccine and in one year 64,000 people were paralyzed
[01:34:10.880 --> 01:34:15.120]  from it they don't call it polio though when you get it from the vaccine they
[01:34:15.120 --> 01:34:28.080]  call it oh they got paralysis now why do I bring that up right now I bring that
[01:34:28.080 --> 01:34:37.600]  up now because who do you think these people are I know who Bill Gates is his
[01:34:37.600 --> 01:34:42.160]  father is a top eugenicist that works for the Rockefeller Foundation and was in
[01:34:42.160 --> 01:34:49.000]  secret army intelligence and is the head of Planned Parenthood he is last time I
[01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:58.400]  checked the financial chairman of the entire Empire do you know that IBM was
[01:34:58.400 --> 01:35:06.040]  set up as a eugenics trust with the express mission of creating a worldwide
[01:35:06.040 --> 01:35:13.200]  race-based system and funded Adolf Hitler do you know that Bill Gates is an
[01:35:13.200 --> 01:35:20.040]  IBM front you can go people journalists are gonna look into this and on no one
[01:35:20.040 --> 01:35:23.280]  had this info how did you know it because I've learned how they run their
[01:35:23.280 --> 01:35:35.800]  operations it's all fronts ladies and gentlemen and by the way I can see their
[01:35:35.800 --> 01:35:41.840]  perspective all these giant populations all these people kill them all these poor
[01:35:41.840 --> 01:35:48.800]  people in India and Africa and on but but they're coming in to Western areas and
[01:35:48.800 --> 01:35:54.920]  trying to inject healthy happy white black Hispanic Asian kids with vaccines
[01:35:54.920 --> 01:35:58.040]  with cancer viruses in them that'll give them cancer 20 years down the road
[01:35:58.040 --> 01:36:01.720]  they're putting fluoride in all our water and of course they are I don't want
[01:36:01.720 --> 01:36:04.680]  to kill those Africans I don't want to kill those poor Indians living in
[01:36:04.680 --> 01:36:09.800]  squalor they are overpopulated in some areas but you can't call them like
[01:36:09.800 --> 01:36:14.760]  animals because the minute you do that you dehumanize everybody but so many
[01:36:14.760 --> 01:36:20.200]  yuppies come to me and they go Alex there are too many people mainly liberals
[01:36:20.200 --> 01:36:26.120]  you get with a liberal professor and they will basically go hey man yeah I
[01:36:26.120 --> 01:36:28.880]  hear your show I know it's true what do you think we're gonna do but there's no
[01:36:28.880 --> 01:36:33.800]  resources we got to reduce the population it's a battle we can't win the
[01:36:33.800 --> 01:36:36.760]  earth-caring capacity has already been reached humans are like a plague there's
[01:36:36.760 --> 01:36:40.280]  nothing to stop us from getting all the resources and blah blah blah while the
[01:36:40.280 --> 01:36:43.840]  globalists suppress new technologies while the globalists everything they can
[01:36:43.840 --> 01:36:50.640]  to keep the dirty technologies in place I've studied what they do and they've
[01:36:50.640 --> 01:36:57.240]  got an operating system they claim they're doing but it's worse than what
[01:36:57.240 --> 01:37:05.680]  they're saying I mean who can go and and and give Indian children shots that
[01:37:05.680 --> 01:37:09.120]  brain damage them and attack their whole nervous system and are full of
[01:37:09.120 --> 01:37:16.320]  cancer viruses SV 40 and others look it up that embed in the body's DNA with the
[01:37:16.320 --> 01:37:21.880]  RNA and kill you when your hormones dip at a certain age I'm gonna go to your
[01:37:21.880 --> 01:37:29.240]  calls and shut up it's just that it's that's only one story it's beyond what I
[01:37:29.240 --> 01:37:36.360]  could ever tell you and you can't be told about the matrix you're going to have
[01:37:36.360 --> 01:37:38.920]  to see it
[01:37:42.760 --> 01:37:48.360]  and what I'm supposed to do is I'm supposed to know about this and want to
[01:37:48.360 --> 01:37:54.400]  survive and just join the establishment and get on elevators and go to the mall
[01:37:54.400 --> 01:37:59.760]  and see families with little kids and see pregnant women and not warn them not
[01:37:59.760 --> 01:38:04.320]  to take vaccines and just not have my family take them do you think any of
[01:38:04.320 --> 01:38:08.800]  the rich people or any of the elites eat GMO or unfiltered water or take
[01:38:08.800 --> 01:38:12.880]  vaccines it's come out in the news the German elite the British elite the
[01:38:12.880 --> 01:38:18.320]  Chinese elite the Russian elite the US elite the Israeli elite none of them
[01:38:18.320 --> 01:38:29.160]  take any of it on record Monsanto CBC 1999 confirmed again two years ago in
[01:38:29.160 --> 01:38:34.160]  other news articles they don't allow GMO in their cafeterias for their
[01:38:34.160 --> 01:38:39.680]  scientists we'll say that again the guys stacking the genetic traits and putting
[01:38:39.680 --> 01:38:44.320]  the Trojan horses in there's not just the trait they're telling you about in
[01:38:44.320 --> 01:38:50.440]  the in the food in the canola in the soybeans in the corn in the wheat they
[01:38:50.440 --> 01:38:54.720]  won't eat it and I've done reports I show a stack of mainstream news articles
[01:38:54.720 --> 01:38:58.840]  where Chinese communists have secret organic farms and drink filtered water
[01:38:58.840 --> 01:39:03.280]  but don't want the public to know German elite have secret farms and don't take
[01:39:03.280 --> 01:39:08.400]  the vaccines or in dangerous situations have safe clean ones that are classified
[01:39:08.400 --> 01:39:15.880]  oh yeah they really have good vaccines mm-hmm they won't let us have them people
[01:39:15.880 --> 01:39:19.880]  go you don't believe that we could be inoculated and get acquired immunity
[01:39:19.880 --> 01:39:23.320]  through that you don't believe in science no I know you there are real
[01:39:23.320 --> 01:39:26.360]  vaccines out there that may still have some side effects but if there's a
[01:39:26.360 --> 01:39:32.520]  bola or smallpox or something I want it but I'm not gonna take some shot from
[01:39:32.520 --> 01:39:37.040]  these devils and what got me thinking about this was the callers talking about
[01:39:37.040 --> 01:39:41.720]  how they're attacking our military with the drugs and the vaccines oh yeah
[01:39:41.720 --> 01:39:48.680]  almost everyone I know who's been in the military from Vietnam on up it didn't
[01:39:48.680 --> 01:39:52.560]  matter if they were football linebackers when and you know sports enthusiasts
[01:39:52.560 --> 01:39:56.280]  they die young they have incredible health problems because of the age in
[01:39:56.280 --> 01:40:03.040]  orange the vaccines the du all of it and they always deny the treatment and they
[01:40:03.040 --> 01:40:07.680]  always put soft kill into the troops I'd say troops get about five times the
[01:40:07.680 --> 01:40:12.040]  soft kill if I had to look at the numbers over the years that the general
[01:40:12.040 --> 01:40:21.080]  public gets I mean almost everybody I know guys that were the star football
[01:40:21.080 --> 01:40:26.000]  player in high school and had a perfect grade point average and you know go and
[01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:32.120]  join special forces and they're 30 years old with all their organs failing the
[01:40:32.120 --> 01:40:35.000]  Navy SEALs they blew up in that helicopter because they knew there was no
[01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:38.400]  bin Laden raid they wouldn't kill this body double we even know the guy's name
[01:40:38.400 --> 01:40:43.080]  I've had the families on years after I told you I talked to Navy SEALs and their
[01:40:43.080 --> 01:40:47.640]  families a week after it happened and man I got death threats when I went on
[01:40:47.640 --> 01:40:53.480]  air when I went on air and said that it was a body double and that and it was a
[01:40:53.480 --> 01:40:56.880]  fake raid they blew up the helicopter try to take them out and then the rest of
[01:40:56.880 --> 01:41:01.200]  them got loaded on one and blown up and then I've been told that by a Navy SEAL
[01:41:01.200 --> 01:41:08.840]  and then separately by a Navy SEALs father who came to my dad because he knew
[01:41:08.840 --> 01:41:17.240]  he knew me and told my dad days after do you think I like going on air and
[01:41:17.240 --> 01:41:20.120]  telling you the government kill those Navy SEALs you think I want to be killed
[01:41:20.120 --> 01:41:25.520]  I have a responsibility to tell you this information so believe me I'm not
[01:41:25.520 --> 01:41:30.400]  making up missing nukes from Dias okay I'm I don't know what they're gonna do
[01:41:30.400 --> 01:41:34.080]  with them I don't know if they were dummy and and and they were and they
[01:41:34.080 --> 01:41:38.360]  weren't real that I hope that's the case look I'm trying to believe this
[01:41:38.360 --> 01:41:42.400]  government in pure evil I'm trying to find some reason to think this isn't a
[01:41:42.400 --> 01:41:49.080]  lost cause because man what's on the other side of this evil is Satan I'm
[01:41:49.080 --> 01:41:56.560]  gonna go to your phone calls squirrel and Adam and Dr. Davis and Shauna and Ben
[01:41:56.560 --> 01:42:01.440]  and other squirrel thanks for holding in Wisconsin what is your topic you want to
[01:42:01.440 --> 01:42:08.120]  bring up we're now totally open lines at 800-259-9231 go ahead I have two
[01:42:08.120 --> 01:42:14.160]  questions let's say that this is this warning is true and they achieve New
[01:42:14.160 --> 01:42:18.720]  World Order with maximum efficacy in depopulation and controlled
[01:42:18.720 --> 01:42:25.280]  centralization what is the plan for resistance after the fall oh it'll be
[01:42:25.280 --> 01:42:27.960]  phased in over the next few decades they're just gonna arrest their political
[01:42:27.960 --> 01:42:32.600]  opposition and then arrest anybody that ever criticizes policies and now your
[01:42:32.600 --> 01:42:36.680]  kids will be sent and raising government dormitories and you'll be forced with
[01:42:36.680 --> 01:42:40.840]  more inoculations and if you go out and protest and say half the blocks got
[01:42:40.840 --> 01:42:44.360]  diabetes a third of the blocks dying of cancer the government did it don't take
[01:42:44.360 --> 01:42:49.000]  the shots when the when the clinic truck comes by you know if somebody has a
[01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:52.560]  convulsion after they're given a guard it's a shot you complain they will say
[01:42:52.560 --> 01:42:56.240]  that you are destabilizing the country and they will come and arrest you and
[01:42:56.240 --> 01:43:00.240]  take you to a forced labor camp where you'll be shot up and given GMO till
[01:43:00.240 --> 01:43:04.760]  your work to death then you'll be taken in you know near death and euthanized by
[01:43:04.760 --> 01:43:10.520]  a trendy who thinks they're helping you I mean that's that's the plan I was
[01:43:10.520 --> 01:43:16.520]  asking what is the plan for a resistant after the fall man I don't know I mean
[01:43:16.520 --> 01:43:21.040]  I'm sitting here 24-7 just watching enemy operations unfold and desperately
[01:43:21.040 --> 01:43:23.640]  screaming my head off trying to tell people this isn't a game it isn't a
[01:43:23.640 --> 01:43:27.840]  joke you know two with by land one if I see or one of my land to it by see
[01:43:27.840 --> 01:43:31.240]  whatever it was the new world order technocrats are here the police states
[01:43:31.240 --> 01:43:35.200]  here they're not coming you know I mean it's all I can do to just track what
[01:43:35.200 --> 01:43:38.800]  they're gonna do next and understand their their psychology their modus operandi
[01:43:38.800 --> 01:43:43.800]  I mean it's just pure evil I mean I go to the shopping mall the grocery store and
[01:43:43.800 --> 01:43:47.280]  I see a pregnant woman I walk up and I I just say you know I don't mean to get
[01:43:47.280 --> 01:43:50.360]  in your business but you need to look up the statistics you're not supposed to
[01:43:50.360 --> 01:43:54.120]  take shots when you're pregnant until five years ago they they knew this they
[01:43:54.120 --> 01:43:58.360]  tell you now to take it I don't want your baby to have problems these vaccines
[01:43:58.360 --> 01:44:03.960]  don't even protect you please research it and I do that because it's a
[01:44:03.960 --> 01:44:07.520]  responsibility I don't want to go talk to people I don't want to give them my
[01:44:07.520 --> 01:44:12.320]  energy I'm exhausted at the grocery store but I've got a responsibility to do
[01:44:12.320 --> 01:44:16.880]  it all I can do is fight on air and fight in person and just put it all in
[01:44:16.880 --> 01:44:21.640]  God's hands and pray for guidance we should repent we should stop watching
[01:44:21.640 --> 01:44:27.040]  all the television we should get back to basics we should think about your
[01:44:27.040 --> 01:44:32.560]  ancestors and and and we've all got the instincts the programming God gave us
[01:44:32.560 --> 01:44:36.320]  you know there with us as well I mean it's incredibly sophisticated and we
[01:44:36.320 --> 01:44:41.640]  can get those memories of what to do and not just what to do to be leaders with
[01:44:41.640 --> 01:44:46.120]  people around you they will see that you've got the tribal leadership of
[01:44:46.120 --> 01:44:50.320]  truth that you're trying to lead them out of Egypt I mean that's what it comes
[01:44:50.320 --> 01:44:54.280]  down to we have to spiritually psychologically in our gut economically
[01:44:54.280 --> 01:44:59.320]  begin to pull out a Babylon in the world but not of it and of course you're
[01:44:59.320 --> 01:45:03.240]  going to be in the world like no other at the fake churches that are there to
[01:45:03.240 --> 01:45:07.280]  grab the good people that resonate with God and want the truth and want the
[01:45:07.280 --> 01:45:12.880]  justice they're the fake counterfeit to capture you under government supervision
[01:45:12.880 --> 01:45:17.440]  with the preacher as an operative of the federal Bureau of Investigation CIA or
[01:45:17.440 --> 01:45:21.200]  Justice Department gauging everything you're doing running a
[01:45:21.200 --> 01:45:25.880]  sanguiation programs trying to break up families get the women's money I mean
[01:45:25.880 --> 01:45:29.840]  it's just criminal psi-op operations we're facing I mean if people knew the
[01:45:29.840 --> 01:45:34.320]  full magnitude of the darkness that's here they have they have arranged and
[01:45:34.320 --> 01:45:38.240]  recruited millions of smart people who know what they're part of and are
[01:45:38.240 --> 01:45:44.240]  working with the evil mainly out of just worldly greed but also out of fear
[01:45:44.240 --> 01:45:51.960]  because the fear of this a lot of people decide to join with it and that's
[01:45:51.960 --> 01:45:56.360]  what they're doing they are kneeling to Satan they are they are taking the
[01:45:56.360 --> 01:46:00.600]  Satan's hand they are embracing Satan and even if you don't believe it's Satan
[01:46:00.600 --> 01:46:09.920]  the art type of Satan did betrayal wickedness fraud lies poverty sorrow just
[01:46:09.920 --> 01:46:16.440]  all the wages of the sin all of the death nuclear weapons bio weapons Ebola
[01:46:16.440 --> 01:46:22.040]  open borders collapse poverty foolishness rioting arrogance bullying
[01:46:22.040 --> 01:46:29.480]  police all of it poured out against us so you ask what we do we see the evil we
[01:46:29.480 --> 01:46:36.560]  recognize it seeing it will immediately the evil just parts around you like like
[01:46:36.560 --> 01:46:43.440]  the sea opening up for Moses but you have to see it and then when you see it
[01:46:43.440 --> 01:46:46.760]  the enemies knows that you see it and their minions that are compartmentalized
[01:46:46.760 --> 01:46:51.800]  know that you see it and it's the hundreds of monkeys syndrome they've
[01:46:51.800 --> 01:46:55.080]  proven one you know an island five miles away from racist monkeys with other
[01:46:55.080 --> 01:46:58.600]  racist monkeys in a facility if they teach the racist monkeys how to do a
[01:46:58.600 --> 01:47:02.320]  trick or how to get into a container that took them five years to learn within
[01:47:02.320 --> 01:47:08.080]  days the monkeys five miles away suddenly know how to open the box you
[01:47:08.080 --> 01:47:12.800]  understand that just knowing this will bring them down you understand that
[01:47:12.800 --> 01:47:18.160]  because it's all a spiritual choice it's already all in front of us the
[01:47:18.160 --> 01:47:23.320]  tyranny is already all in the open I shouldn't even have to show people the
[01:47:23.320 --> 01:47:29.320]  tyranny and chronicle the tyranny it's in prima facie or on its face and so if
[01:47:29.320 --> 01:47:38.320]  people can just be told that it's up to their free will to witness the evil and
[01:47:38.320 --> 01:47:42.320]  the manipulation of themselves and then they make the spiritual decision to not
[01:47:42.320 --> 01:47:47.920]  be in denial and not be in delusion then their eyes will be opened do you see
[01:47:47.920 --> 01:47:54.880]  what I'm saying colors gone Adam in South Carolina thanks for holding her on
[01:47:54.880 --> 01:48:02.560]  the air hey what's up Alex how you doing man I'm alright hey man I live in a
[01:48:02.560 --> 01:48:06.360]  I live in South Carolina in a city called Rock Hill man I'm calling about a
[01:48:06.360 --> 01:48:11.160]  couple things one is this martial law thing that's going on man this is a
[01:48:11.160 --> 01:48:15.000]  South story man I kind of want you to know just the gravity of the lives of
[01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:18.520]  truth touch man me right now I'm currently homeless man but I'm still
[01:48:18.520 --> 01:48:22.920]  a part of the resistance I'm still a part of the revolution I got nothing to my
[01:48:22.920 --> 01:48:26.560]  name and pretty much all I got is a job and a girlfriend man I'm in such a tough
[01:48:26.560 --> 01:48:31.000]  spot right now I just been staying with a friend but you're not in a tough spot
[01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:34.520]  they condition people that if they don't have moderate success that you're a
[01:48:34.520 --> 01:48:39.560]  failure you are there you may be the person or someone like you that catches
[01:48:39.560 --> 01:48:44.000]  the globalist planning the atomic weapon and then getting it out before they can
[01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:47.320]  stop us on an international system that's why we want to mop up every
[01:48:47.320 --> 01:48:51.120]  country before they start really running bad stuff because the truth could go out
[01:48:51.120 --> 01:48:55.440]  in any country and bring them down it could be a homeless person who who
[01:48:55.440 --> 01:48:59.240]  brings them down it could be a lawyer on an airplane seeing him put terrorists
[01:48:59.240 --> 01:49:03.800]  on the aircraft it could be anybody I mean you understand that just the fact
[01:49:03.800 --> 01:49:07.680]  that you're awake is what's valuable the fact that you've got your soul that
[01:49:07.680 --> 01:49:12.920]  you're not under their control that's what matters brother exactly and Alex
[01:49:12.920 --> 01:49:16.200]  the truth is man is ever since I've become a weak man these guys did it
[01:49:16.200 --> 01:49:18.800]  honestly and truly they have been following me man they've been following
[01:49:18.800 --> 01:49:22.640]  me they follow my friends they're harassing us out here I protested
[01:49:22.640 --> 01:49:26.920]  about a couple days ago for Mike Brown downtown in my city man we protested we
[01:49:26.920 --> 01:49:31.040]  were out there holding signs cops were driving by Alex driving by taking
[01:49:31.040 --> 01:49:35.360]  pictures laughing all I mean it's they've been parking up outside of my
[01:49:35.360 --> 01:49:39.680]  friend's house watching them let me say what happens you can debate all the
[01:49:39.680 --> 01:49:44.080]  different sides of the Mike Brown thing so you're used as a simulant in your
[01:49:44.080 --> 01:49:49.040]  protest for them engaging in secret police activities but next year it'll be
[01:49:49.040 --> 01:49:53.760]  the Tea Party so I want the cops to remember that they should be proud of
[01:49:53.760 --> 01:49:57.080]  people that are willing to come out and protest for for something that thinks
[01:49:57.080 --> 01:50:02.400]  wrong even if it turns out that Brown was a thug and charged the police I think
[01:50:02.400 --> 01:50:05.800]  the evidence is mounting it's like the guy that has the knife they call and go
[01:50:05.800 --> 01:50:08.680]  he's got a steak knife you see him pull the steak knife out he gets up on the
[01:50:08.680 --> 01:50:12.280]  wall like he's about the lunge at the cops it's the guy was suicidal you know
[01:50:12.280 --> 01:50:17.200]  the second guy they shot still see it's it's not the both sides are wrong people
[01:50:17.200 --> 01:50:21.840]  always think of one side being right or the other side being wrong or vice
[01:50:21.840 --> 01:50:29.760]  person no it's it's it's all part of a sick evil culture of young people willing
[01:50:29.760 --> 01:50:35.120]  to walk up with steak knives at cops and then witnesses lying and saying no they
[01:50:35.120 --> 01:50:38.960]  shot him in cold blood again meanwhile there was cell phone video and witnesses
[01:50:38.960 --> 01:50:43.320]  of 911 call so the cops are being lied about so they start lying and see it
[01:50:43.320 --> 01:50:48.000]  becomes a vicious cycle of corruption it's just it's just a total mess but I
[01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:52.040]  hear you I hear you and then the police are putting you in an intelligence

[01:54:20.840 --> 01:54:25.480]  institutions set up to deal with those crises and so those institutions
[01:54:25.480 --> 01:54:32.000]  expand their power and you do it over and over again towards the aim of a
[01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:36.120]  scientific dictatorship and the globalist openly say in their writings
[01:54:36.120 --> 01:54:40.280]  again if you want to see the proof watch my film end game a blueprint for
[01:54:40.280 --> 01:54:45.400]  global enslavement in that documentary we show all their quotes the books the
[01:54:45.400 --> 01:54:51.120]  news articles the video clips were royalty the Rothschilds the Rockefellers
[01:54:51.120 --> 01:54:59.640]  they're all on record they argue hey we're in control that's social Darwinism
[01:54:59.640 --> 01:55:05.880]  that the robber barons as everyone know totally adopted 150 years ago 160 years
[01:55:05.880 --> 01:55:10.760]  ago now in Europe in England in the United States this is all mainline
[01:55:10.760 --> 01:55:15.600]  history and they said we will scientifically develop systems of
[01:55:15.600 --> 01:55:21.960]  social control we will take control of the future destiny of humanity and you
[01:55:21.960 --> 01:55:26.720]  read the stuff Galton wrote in 1855 and stuff the father of eugenics and the
[01:55:26.720 --> 01:55:33.080]  rest of them and Darwin and all of them I mean they were hyper smart and hyper
[01:55:33.080 --> 01:55:39.520]  evil and hyper anti-human and they said they would reduce world population then
[01:55:39.520 --> 01:55:45.440]  they've always had this plan and they've been working for over 160 years total to
[01:55:45.440 --> 01:55:49.960]  bring it into fruition but there are other competing forces but a lot of
[01:55:49.960 --> 01:55:55.240]  people argue hey there aren't too many people okay but you're in the crosshairs
[01:55:55.240 --> 01:56:02.720]  now to just because you agree with that doesn't get you out of the trick I want
[01:56:02.720 --> 01:56:05.760]  to go to dr. Davis and

[01:58:01.320 --> 01:58:05.360]  area knew when they read that label how incredibly affordable it was for what
[01:58:05.360 --> 01:58:10.000]  was in it and that's the organic types that only a couple companies have well
[01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:13.240]  each company has each ingredient you had to go buy it from them to be able to
[01:58:13.240 --> 01:58:16.560]  produce it and more of that's reportedly coming in probably looks like ten

[02:00:20.280 --> 02:00:25.600]  Alex Jones I'm not exaggerating I probably got 200 or more articles here
[02:00:25.600 --> 02:00:31.720]  I haven't hit yet I'm a smatter a few in to the next hour but I really want to
[02:00:31.720 --> 02:00:36.200]  do what I was able to do when I was first on talk radio I was put on a
[02:00:36.200 --> 02:00:40.640]  station right when it went to talk the first week it went from heavy metal
[02:00:40.640 --> 02:00:47.920]  rock and roll and classic rock called Z rock to talk I was put on it they had
[02:00:47.920 --> 02:00:50.920]  G Gordon Liddy Howard Stern and they had local shows on in the afternoon and at
[02:00:50.920 --> 02:00:55.720]  night none of them could get calls the first week the program director liked
[02:00:55.720 --> 02:01:03.240]  me had seen my access TV show put me on and instantly all 10 phone lines loaded
[02:01:03.240 --> 02:01:09.840]  up they had 10 phone lines loaded and so I thought it was really neat and the
[02:01:09.840 --> 02:01:15.520]  program is like more calls more calls so I could take 50 calls an hour and it
[02:01:15.520 --> 02:01:20.360]  was actually good radio for years I cannot break the habit I've gotten into
[02:01:20.360 --> 02:01:23.520]  to maybe taking three four calls an hour which people get time and I go to them
[02:01:23.520 --> 02:01:27.520]  and limbaugh probably takes three or four an hour to it's because we want to
[02:01:27.520 --> 02:01:30.120]  talk I mean we got stuff to say we're not bored being here
[02:01:30.120 --> 02:01:33.480]  nothing worse than listen to a talk show host you can tell struggling or as
[02:01:33.480 --> 02:01:37.720]  nervous or unfortunately I'm the opposite I wish I wasn't so confident I
[02:01:37.720 --> 02:01:41.320]  would do a better job I forget I'm on air sometimes just start babbling
[02:01:41.320 --> 02:01:46.640]  mindlessly or telling jokes cuz I kind of go wherever my brain's taking me but
[02:01:46.640 --> 02:01:50.080]  I'm in the serious mood today so I want of course I always say this the calls
[02:01:50.080 --> 02:01:53.560]  will be so good some will be bad then I'll let them go for five minutes of
[02:01:53.560 --> 02:01:56.720]  peace but just have what you want to say ready say it I'm gonna go to the next
[02:01:56.720 --> 02:02:04.680]  person because I want to take a bunch of calls today 800 259 92 31 Dr. Davis in
[02:02:04.680 --> 02:02:10.320]  Florida you're on the air hello Alex how are you good thanks for calling sir
[02:02:10.320 --> 02:02:14.280]  great we spoke a few months ago when I was talking about my experience with
[02:02:14.280 --> 02:02:19.080]  radiation Fukushima and at the time I'd mentioned that I wanted to really come
[02:02:19.080 --> 02:02:24.000]  back at some point and talk about solutions because there are many many
[02:02:24.000 --> 02:02:29.800]  people out there who are awake and fully aware but they are not consumed by
[02:02:29.800 --> 02:02:34.160]  fear in fact it's really more of a motivating factor in order for them to
[02:02:34.160 --> 02:02:39.160]  find solutions and to work towards that and I tell us some of the solution that
[02:02:39.160 --> 02:02:46.800]  is well my company is a small startup biotech company called O'Chinix and I
[02:02:46.800 --> 02:02:52.440]  didn't we have you on as a guest you have yes yeah okay how you doing we're
[02:02:52.440 --> 02:02:57.280]  doing fine thank you so much and calling today because I'm a little bit
[02:02:57.280 --> 02:03:02.480]  frustrated with one of our solutions but I'll get to that in a second but about a
[02:03:02.480 --> 02:03:08.600]  year ago we took one of our drugs that is a converted natural product and
[02:03:08.600 --> 02:03:14.880]  introduced that to the Fort Dietrich group at the US Army and there's some
[02:03:14.880 --> 02:03:20.160]  outstanding scientists and people that work there and they began a series of
[02:03:20.160 --> 02:03:25.400]  experiments against Ebola and a number of the other you know Marburg and Rift
[02:03:25.400 --> 02:03:29.240]  Valley fever and a number of the different extremely deadly pathogens that
[02:03:29.240 --> 02:03:35.040]  they have after a level 4 facility at Fort Dietrich and they had results that
[02:03:35.040 --> 02:03:40.680]  were unprecedented this one drug was killing all of those different types of
[02:03:40.680 --> 02:03:44.960]  viruses all the different families of viruses and it was doing it without any
[02:03:44.960 --> 02:03:49.680]  apparent toxicity to the normal healthy cells that were within the tissue
[02:03:49.680 --> 02:03:53.920]  itself so these were tests that were done in Petri dishes not in live animals
[02:03:53.920 --> 02:03:58.240]  that was going to be the next step and just as we were given authorization to
[02:03:58.240 --> 02:04:02.320]  move to live animals all of a sudden Fort Dietrich went
[02:04:02.320 --> 02:04:08.160]  radiosan and this was just weeks before the Ebola epidemic was announced to
[02:04:08.160 --> 02:04:13.160]  you know this newest outbreak with this particular strain of virus which is of
[02:04:13.160 --> 02:04:19.520]  course very very deadly and since that time we have tried without any success
[02:04:19.520 --> 02:04:25.320]  in terms of reaching the people in charge of the project as well as some
[02:04:25.320 --> 02:04:30.960]  outreach that we've made to a number of the organization so I've made it well
[02:04:30.960 --> 02:04:33.960]  yeah that's because the other system wants to promote the Bill Omelette and
[02:04:33.960 --> 02:04:40.520]  the Gates Monsanto Ebola vaccine they don't want to you know sit there and
[02:04:40.520 --> 02:04:44.160]  talk to all the US companies that have solutions they just warehouse things
[02:04:44.160 --> 02:04:48.080]  write an article for us for some info and send it over it was good to hear

[02:07:59.440 --> 02:08:06.520]  you are in process of developing a whole series of techniques which will
[02:08:06.520 --> 02:08:14.120]  enable the controlling oligarchy to get people actually to love their servitude
[02:08:14.120 --> 02:08:22.320]  people can be made to enjoy a state of affairs which by any decent standard they
[02:08:22.320 --> 02:08:31.320]  ought not to enjoy. I hope you'd better start from the beginning. I hope you'd better start from the
[02:08:31.320 --> 02:08:48.000]  beginning. Too many kids. Too many kids are what's making the planet worse. A lot of these kids come from bad gene pools. They don't have stable parents making good
[02:08:48.000 --> 02:08:55.080]  decisions. Mercury containing vaccines may help not harm kids according to two new
[02:08:55.080 --> 02:08:59.360]  studies in the journal pediatrics these new studies suggest that the opposite
[02:08:59.360 --> 02:09:02.960]  that the preservatives may actually be associated with improved behavior and
[02:09:02.960 --> 02:09:07.320]  mental performance. Fluoride in water is supposed to fight tooth decay but could
[02:09:07.320 --> 02:09:12.280]  it also cause cancer. Oh yeah the government had the right under US law to
[02:09:12.280 --> 02:09:16.400]  conduct secret testing on the American public under specific conditions. We have
[02:09:16.400 --> 02:09:21.240]  to work the dark side or we will spend time in the shadows. Any attempt to
[02:09:21.240 --> 02:09:26.360]  achieve world order must be the work of the devil. Well join me and I'm glad to
[02:09:26.360 --> 02:09:33.360]  sit here at the right hand to say there's a need for new world order. Someday in the
[02:09:33.360 --> 02:09:39.360]  next few years a solution will emerge.
[02:09:46.360 --> 02:09:55.160]  XCIA officer there are ISIS sleeper cells in the US. It's up on infowars.com. Senator
[02:09:55.160 --> 02:10:00.760]  Inhofe says brace for US cities to be blown up by ISIS, formerly known as
[02:10:00.760 --> 02:10:04.720]  al-Qaeda. They changed the name when it got embarrassing when our government was
[02:10:04.720 --> 02:10:12.680]  arming them. Turn them loose in Syria and Iraq and now the Marines have issued a
[02:10:12.680 --> 02:10:17.800]  threat to ISIS force recon. Do you really think you stand a chance in this
[02:10:17.800 --> 02:10:22.600]  country? Well of course they do. They're gonna be protected and you're
[02:10:22.600 --> 02:10:28.600]  compartmentalized and so they've got a joke saying warning 72 virgin dating
[02:10:28.600 --> 02:10:35.320]  service apply here and I understand they want to go kill them but you're being
[02:10:35.320 --> 02:10:39.520]  set up. You'll be deployed against some low-level conscripts that al-Qaeda
[02:10:39.520 --> 02:10:44.800]  controls just like in 2001 in Afghanistan they'll be well paid move the
[02:10:44.800 --> 02:10:49.080]  next country to destabilize but I know that it didn't fit into the narrative it
[02:10:49.080 --> 02:10:53.160]  just feels good to be think you're heroes and you do go fight really bad
[02:10:53.160 --> 02:10:58.480]  people second say you are heroes but a real hero would understand the Cyop and
[02:10:58.480 --> 02:11:02.840]  do something about it to save the country before they allow ISIS to hit us
[02:11:02.840 --> 02:11:06.800]  or the globalist do it and ISIS takes credit and then they take more of our
[02:11:06.800 --> 02:11:12.560]  liberties. Homeland security is pointed at your grandpa Marines it's pointed at
[02:11:12.560 --> 02:11:16.320]  George Washington it's pointed at private property it's pointed at the
[02:11:16.320 --> 02:11:20.760]  Second Amendment and that's all on record now but I said it 13 years ago
[02:11:20.760 --> 02:11:25.440]  because I know the globalist game plan I read the Rand Corporation documents you
[02:11:25.440 --> 02:11:32.280]  can read them too you can learn about it. And these Navy SEALs on here wearing
[02:11:32.280 --> 02:11:36.680]  skull mask I mean give me a break whether that psychologically scares the
[02:11:36.680 --> 02:11:46.320]  quote enemy that's why they're off chopping heads off. You got the Mexican
[02:11:46.320 --> 02:11:49.920]  drug cartels wearing skull mask our troops doing it al-Qaeda running around
[02:11:49.920 --> 02:11:53.120]  chopping heads off it just makes you want to throw up and all these Marines
[02:11:53.120 --> 02:11:56.600]  will end up being cops going against the Tea Party folks or if you don't join
[02:11:56.600 --> 02:12:00.080]  that then they'll go up against you. So you'll either be attacked by the police
[02:12:00.080 --> 02:12:03.160]  in the military if you're for a military or you'll join it I mean it's just a
[02:12:03.160 --> 02:12:07.920]  sick treasonous mess. Shawna in Kentucky thanks for holding you're on the
[02:12:07.920 --> 02:12:13.640]  air worldwide go ahead. Hi Alex I'm God with me up this morning to give you a
[02:12:13.640 --> 02:12:17.920]  message concerning ISIS and I don't have TV but I listen to you on the phone all
[02:12:17.920 --> 02:12:21.640]  the time so I have a clarification question for you real quick before I
[02:12:21.640 --> 02:12:27.600]  can give you this message. Is ISIS spelled I S I S? Ma'am I don't really fully
[02:12:27.600 --> 02:12:30.600]  understand this but they've they've put out a bunch of names to confuse people.
[02:12:30.600 --> 02:12:35.640]  It's al-Qaeda in Iraq that was allowed an arm to go in and attack Syria then they
[02:12:35.640 --> 02:12:40.640]  changed it to ISIS to confuse the public and now just Islamic State. So yes it's
[02:12:40.640 --> 02:12:49.000]  spelled I S I S. Okay so I S I S and this is what God showed me. I'm going to read it because this is what
[02:12:49.000 --> 02:12:53.960]  this is what happens here Alex. This is baby code ISIS is baby code for the new
[02:12:53.960 --> 02:13:01.000]  order in the globalist. Baby code. Baby code. I mean they did like you said they
[02:13:01.000 --> 02:13:04.920]  killed one of the Navy's field sons. He was a cryptologist. They went after our
[02:13:04.920 --> 02:13:08.360]  cryptologist but I'm going to tell you this baby code very quickly. Baby code or
[02:13:08.360 --> 02:13:14.600]  baby code? Baby. Baby code anybody can understand this Alex. Oh I mean I'm having
[02:13:14.600 --> 02:13:21.400]  trouble hearing baby code I'm sorry. Okay yeah baby code. A is equal to 1. B is
[02:13:21.400 --> 02:13:30.880]  equal to 2. Okay. I is equal to 9. S is equal to 19. Oh yeah no it calculates
[02:13:30.880 --> 02:13:36.040]  out to Satan. It calculates out to 9-11. It's obviously a globalist code. ISIS he
[02:13:36.040 --> 02:13:40.800]  gets into all their Babylon mystery religion garbage in Egypt. Yes absolutely
[02:13:40.800 --> 02:13:45.120]  it is super illuminati stuff in our face and you're saying God showed that to
[02:13:45.120 --> 02:13:51.720]  you. Yes he did. In fact he said that if you put the 9-1-9, the IS and then the
[02:13:51.720 --> 02:13:56.400]  9-1-9 underneath the IS you have 9-11 four different ways that's very big to
[02:13:56.400 --> 02:14:00.840]  them. No you did. The globalists are obsessed with numerology and what you're
[02:14:00.840 --> 02:14:04.640]  saying has been pointed out. It does come out to 9-11 four different ways
[02:14:04.640 --> 02:14:09.400]  which is just over the top and that's why they chose that name. It's a big
[02:14:09.400 --> 02:14:14.600]  globalist joke. The name Al Qaeda just means the base. The computer program at
[02:14:14.600 --> 02:14:22.520]  the CIA headquarters of radical Islamists they were paying. Very interesting
[02:14:22.520 --> 02:14:25.680]  call. I thought you were kind of goofy at first. I apologize but no what you're
[02:14:25.680 --> 02:14:29.920]  saying is you're right that that that is what it comes out to. What else did you
[02:14:29.920 --> 02:14:35.680]  want to say? Okay if you flip that over because they're very into it. They love
[02:14:35.680 --> 02:14:40.600]  to turn their 9s and 6s over. They did that in White House family. They put the
[02:14:40.600 --> 02:14:45.280]  present vehicle over. If you flip it over Alex you have 6-1-6, 6-1-6, you add those
[02:14:45.280 --> 02:14:50.240]  together. You've got 2, 13, and this thing... Well you're right. It's like Pixar put
[02:14:50.240 --> 02:14:54.440]  secret codes in their movies. Disney does. Yes and this is all a secret
[02:14:54.440 --> 02:14:57.960]  language for the Illuminati to communicate with each other. I mean that's
[02:14:57.960 --> 02:15:03.240]  what it is. Just like the gangs have their graffiti and other people do, this is
[02:15:03.240 --> 02:15:07.880]  their communication. I really appreciate you calling. She's right. First I thought
[02:15:07.880 --> 02:15:11.360]  she was schizophrenic or something because the phone was hard to hear and I
[02:15:11.360 --> 02:15:16.000]  was like baby toad. I apologize ma'am. Thank you for holding to tell us that.
[02:15:16.000 --> 02:15:22.800]  Yeah I know. ISIS is just a pure rebranding so that when it comes out
[02:15:22.800 --> 02:15:27.600]  our government funded them. People go well that's IS not al-Qaeda or ISIS. Ben in
[02:15:27.600 --> 02:15:34.080]  Missouri you're on the air. Hey Alex it's good to speak with you again. I had a
[02:15:34.080 --> 02:15:38.760]  couple points. I'll get through them quickly. First of all I met Joe Bates
[02:15:38.760 --> 02:15:44.560]  and Jakari Jackson and Ferguson last week. They're really really awesome guys.
[02:15:44.560 --> 02:15:48.720]  I really enjoyed hanging out with them over lunch. Aren't they both men's man?
[02:15:48.720 --> 02:15:53.800]  It's great to work with great guys like that. They're both class facts. Yeah they
[02:15:53.800 --> 02:15:57.000]  really are. The thing that struck me about that was the fact that they were
[02:15:57.000 --> 02:16:01.360]  streaming on an iPhone which the reason why it struck me was because it made me
[02:16:01.360 --> 02:16:05.880]  kind of realize that anybody can really be a journalist who really wants to and
[02:16:05.880 --> 02:16:11.200]  people should start doing so. That was the point number one. Point number two
[02:16:11.200 --> 02:16:19.800]  is this beheading video. I have this feeling and I have seen lots of beheading
[02:16:19.800 --> 02:16:25.200]  videos just because you know that's I don't know maybe it's my macabre side if
[02:16:25.200 --> 02:16:29.880]  you're into to me or something but I think that that video is a little bit
[02:16:29.880 --> 02:16:35.280]  too well done and it is kind of coincidental to me that as the guy is
[02:16:35.280 --> 02:16:40.440]  sawing the guy's head off with the knife and sorry to be graphic to all the
[02:16:40.440 --> 02:16:45.000]  listeners but as he's sawing his head off with the knife they cut immediately to
[02:16:45.000 --> 02:16:49.360]  the head on top of a body. I mean it looks like a horror movie but I guess
[02:16:49.360 --> 02:16:54.280]  even if it was real or if it's not real it doesn't matter. Well I've seen the full
[02:16:54.280 --> 02:16:58.800]  video so a lot of people say oh it's fake because it cuts. Now that's what the news
[02:16:58.800 --> 02:17:03.960]  basically put out and what got edited. It looks very cinematic out there in the
[02:17:03.960 --> 02:17:08.560]  dunes in the desert. They do all that to be cinematic to get more crazies to come
[02:17:08.560 --> 02:17:13.640]  join them. It's probably real. We know there's been some fake beheadings put on
[02:17:13.640 --> 02:17:18.360]  by university students and others a few years ago. We know that hoaxes have been
[02:17:18.360 --> 02:17:22.600]  done as well and Al Qaeda's done hoaxes and launching chemical attacks to
[02:17:22.600 --> 02:17:27.880]  blame it on Syrian government and Syrian armies so you could be right. I
[02:17:27.880 --> 02:17:31.840]  appreciate your call. Great points. Let's talk to Bubba in Virginia. You're on the
[02:17:31.840 --> 02:17:36.720]  air. Alex, thanks for taking my call. I have a couple of points to address real
[02:17:36.720 --> 02:17:42.160]  quick. One is we all know how hard the 22 ammunition is to find nowadays so by the
[02:17:42.160 --> 02:17:46.640]  day I was actually in the store and we had several boxes of 22 so I was kind of
[02:17:46.640 --> 02:17:52.800]  surprised. So I asked the person working there and let me see some of the 22
[02:17:52.800 --> 02:17:56.280]  and the guy says well make sure you take the book out before you buy it. And so
[02:17:56.280 --> 02:18:00.320]  what's wrong with it? Because it's made out of tin. So because we've
[02:18:00.320 --> 02:18:04.880]  set down all of our smoking plants over here we're buying tin ammunition while
[02:18:04.880 --> 02:18:09.480]  in China they're making the good copper and lead stuff. That's right, that's
[02:18:09.480 --> 02:18:13.200]  right. The regulations, I talked about this yesterday, how they're shutting down
[02:18:13.200 --> 02:18:18.080]  our beef production. The regulations are so hardcore there is not one lead
[02:18:18.080 --> 02:18:24.160]  producing facility in the United States but it is key to all industrial major
[02:18:24.160 --> 02:18:31.600]  activities. We are industrially being set up and now the ammo we're getting is
[02:18:31.600 --> 02:18:35.920]  total crap that doesn't even fire right in the firearms and now Obama is
[02:18:35.920 --> 02:18:40.720]  blocking importation of ammo. You see how that's a checkmate. I mean this this is
[02:18:40.720 --> 02:18:45.360]  incredible and it's not just the ammo, it's everything. They are destroying the
[02:18:45.360 --> 02:18:50.360]  country when you look at it as an economist. Go ahead. So the next thing I
[02:18:50.360 --> 02:18:55.040]  want to bring out is that all this situation in Ferguson, what this reminds
[02:18:55.040 --> 02:18:59.920]  me of is a lot of stuff what happened over in Iran back in the 50s with
[02:18:59.920 --> 02:19:03.560]  the Kermit Roosevelt going over there and hiring all these thugs and stuff
[02:19:03.560 --> 02:19:06.920]  to basically overthrow the government. You can see a lot of the same similarities
[02:19:06.920 --> 02:19:10.680]  going on in Ferguson. Yeah, that's Operation Ajax. In fact, thanks for
[02:19:10.680 --> 02:19:15.080]  reminding me. They then double-crossed the radical Muslims who helped bring
[02:19:15.080 --> 02:19:21.640]  them to power in the 1953 Operation Ajax. Great point. The next thing I'd like to
[02:19:21.640 --> 02:19:27.560]  point out is it's a plug for y'all with the iodine. When I was younger I lived in
[02:19:27.560 --> 02:19:31.800]  the Bronfels right down the road from y'all and I worked at a place where we
[02:19:31.800 --> 02:19:35.360]  raised pigs. So the pigs that were born in the Faroan Creek. Hold on, I want to hear
[02:19:35.360 --> 02:19:39.000]  this on the other side. Will you stay a little bit longer Bubba? Yes sir. All right,
[02:19:39.000 --> 02:19:42.920]  thank you. That's what my sister calls me is Bubba. That's my nickname. So then it
[02:19:42.920 --> 02:19:46.600]  stuck with my parents and I'm called Bubba. That's a little secret nobody knew.
[02:19:46.600 --> 02:19:51.080]  We're gonna come back and talk to Bubba on the other side and then we're gonna
[02:19:51.080 --> 02:19:59.520]  talk to Mike, Jason, Kyle, Mark, and others. InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com.

[02:21:01.760 --> 02:21:06.480]  atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[02:21:06.480 --> 02:21:10.520]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic. Indoor air has been shown to have
[02:21:10.520 --> 02:21:14.320]  two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air. And
[02:21:14.320 --> 02:21:18.720]  most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within
[02:21:18.720 --> 02:21:22.520]  their homes. There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[02:21:22.520 --> 02:21:26.960]  Well over a thousand types of mold in mildew link to numerous conditions. And
[02:21:26.960 --> 02:21:30.160]  don't forget the fact that six million Americans live with pets they're
[02:21:30.160 --> 02:21:33.720]  allergic to as well. When I began to research these statistics it was clear
[02:21:33.720 --> 02:21:38.440]  to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic
[02:21:38.440 --> 02:21:42.040]  environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against. Made with

[02:22:19.120 --> 02:22:23.400]  reality. If my husband died how would I pay the mortgage, the car payments or keep
[02:22:23.400 --> 02:22:27.000]  up the life the kids and I had. I realized I needed to get us life insurance

[02:24:23.640 --> 02:24:43.400]  Boy, Bob Dylan called it back in 1982 on the Union democracy don't rule the
[02:24:43.400 --> 02:25:07.720]  world. You better get that through your head. This world is ruled by violence.
[02:25:07.720 --> 02:25:25.200]  Let's go ahead and go back to Bob. Bob, you were telling a story about hogs down
[02:25:25.200 --> 02:25:29.240]  in New Braunville's quaint little German community south of Austin north of
[02:25:29.240 --> 02:25:32.720]  San Antonio where you grew up. Go ahead and finish your story.
[02:25:32.720 --> 02:25:38.960]  It's kind of a plug in a concern that I have because like I'm saying, so I
[02:25:38.960 --> 02:25:42.280]  worked at a place and we were raised hogs. The ones that were born, and it's
[02:25:42.280 --> 02:25:46.760]  called a frowning crate, weren't born out on the ground. Pretty soon like
[02:25:46.760 --> 02:25:50.120]  within the first week of them being born, we'd give them an iodine shot. Well, when I
[02:25:50.120 --> 02:25:52.920]  first started working I said, why do you give an iodine shot? I said, well, because
[02:25:52.920 --> 02:25:57.640]  normally to get it out of the ground and from suckling on the mother to get it
[02:25:57.640 --> 02:26:01.520]  up from the dirt and everything. So you have to give an iodine shot that helps
[02:26:01.520 --> 02:26:05.840]  immune system and everything else. Well, so the iodine you get, I mean, I buy it, I've
[02:26:05.840 --> 02:26:10.400]  been buying it since you've had it and everything. Great stuff. A concern, like
[02:26:10.400 --> 02:26:15.000]  I said, that I have as well is the fact that anymore, most of our livestock, pigs,
[02:26:15.000 --> 02:26:19.080]  chickens, you name it, they're all raised internally in a cage. So they're not on
[02:26:19.080 --> 02:26:22.440]  the ground. So they're not getting that iodine in their system. So we're not
[02:26:22.440 --> 02:26:27.040]  getting the iodine from the meat products that we buy either. Because they're
[02:26:27.040 --> 02:26:30.760]  all, you know, that GMO foods and everything else are not raised naturally at
[02:26:30.760 --> 02:26:34.480]  all. Well, that's right. Any farmer, any medical doctor, anybody, if you go back
[02:26:34.480 --> 02:26:38.920]  50, 60 years ago, everybody knew about iodine. The Chinese government puts it
[02:26:38.920 --> 02:26:43.920]  in their water. They haven't added in areas that have iodine deficiencies in
[02:26:43.920 --> 02:26:52.120]  the soil. And our government, though, puts the bad halogens in the water
[02:26:52.120 --> 02:26:58.240]  instead. So it's a perfect storm. And that's why thyroid problem in women in
[02:26:58.240 --> 02:27:05.480]  this country is just epidemic. Look, what we're saying is fact here. The
[02:27:05.480 --> 02:27:10.200]  government knows we have iodine deficiencies. They've lowered the allowance
[02:27:10.200 --> 02:27:18.520]  they say take down to nothing. Under the UN Codex alimentarius, they are
[02:27:18.520 --> 02:27:23.280]  openly setting it up where they're going to lower the allowances even lower and
[02:27:23.280 --> 02:27:28.120]  then not let you get vitamins or minerals that are above that and make it
[02:27:28.120 --> 02:27:33.560]  controlled substances. Just and if government was doing that on one or two
[02:27:33.560 --> 02:27:36.720]  things, it'd be like, oh, they're just idiots. No, man, they're doing it on
[02:27:36.720 --> 02:27:42.680]  everything. I work for a large animal vet. He'd go out and say, your cattle need
[02:27:42.680 --> 02:27:48.840]  more minerals. And he'd tell them what mineral mix to buy. They won't tell
[02:27:48.840 --> 02:27:52.040]  anybody what's going on around here. That's why we have the InfoWars health
[02:27:52.040 --> 02:27:57.120]  products, InfoWars live products, the Beyond Tangentangerine, the X2 nation
[02:27:57.120 --> 02:28:01.560]  iodine. It's the best out there in my view. Bar 9. Try it compared to others,
[02:28:01.560 --> 02:28:04.560]  folks. It's just incredible. And I'm not differentiating. I mean, we made the
[02:28:04.560 --> 02:28:07.960]  iodine market big again. We're not even in competition with the competition.
[02:28:07.960 --> 02:28:13.120]  We're really trying to have a revolution here of waking people up. We've
[02:28:13.120 --> 02:28:16.440]  already had big companies try to buy us out, want to put it in shampoo and stuff.
[02:28:16.440 --> 02:28:23.160]  And just quite frankly, we don't have the supply to be able to do that. So the
[02:28:23.160 --> 02:28:26.960]  whole system knows about all this stuff. And I'm just here to popularize
[02:28:26.960 --> 02:28:32.600]  what was known. So I'm really glad you told us that story. Yeah, a lot of times
[02:28:32.600 --> 02:28:37.000]  they give even more minerals to cows. I remember hearing large animal vet, I
[02:28:37.000 --> 02:28:41.600]  worked for, talk about this, when a bad freeze is coming. Because cows can live
[02:28:41.600 --> 02:28:46.760]  in subzero temperatures, but it's like 40 below like Nebraska inside a barn. They
[02:28:46.760 --> 02:28:50.840]  can still die sometimes. And so when cold weather is coming, they have a certain
[02:28:50.840 --> 02:28:54.560]  mix. They try to really accelerate to give to the cows. And then when they have
[02:28:54.560 --> 02:28:59.160]  the minerals, they don't die. So I mean, look, having a higher intake of a wide
[02:28:59.160 --> 02:29:04.340]  spectrum of minerals must be important. If veterinarians 100 years ago were
[02:29:04.340 --> 02:29:09.520]  saying, give your cows this, this, this salt mix, this mineral mix before the
[02:29:09.520 --> 02:29:15.280]  cold weather gets here. So they don't die. This is all known. Anything else?
[02:29:15.280 --> 02:29:19.360]  A lot of those arcs are being lost too, because the way they're dumbing everybody
[02:29:19.360 --> 02:29:22.640]  down. So a lot of those arcs are being lost, how to can food, how to take care
[02:29:22.640 --> 02:29:25.760]  of yourself, how to do things, how to grow, grow young garden things. Those, those
[02:29:25.760 --> 02:29:29.320]  are all becoming a lost art. That's why it's really important for people, you know,
[02:29:29.320 --> 02:29:34.960]  I know this was most of the part of me. I think we lost that caller. Well, thank
[02:29:34.960 --> 02:29:39.920]  you, sir. We're gonna be right back on the side. Thank you, Bubba. Yes, we do a
[02:29:39.920 --> 02:29:43.760]  whole show on the lost arts. Everything, all the basic knowledge that
[02:29:43.760 --> 02:29:47.120]  allowed humans to survive has been taken away. We're being taught Walmart and
[02:29:47.120 --> 02:29:51.760]  McDonald's and a MRAP. We're on the Mars. We'll save us. The Empire. That's all you
[02:29:51.760 --> 02:29:57.280]  need is an iPad, Alex Jones, wireless, GMO and some brain cancer. And then
[02:29:57.280 --> 02:30:01.560]  everything's as happy as a pig. And you know what? I began to get into iodine a
[02:30:01.560 --> 02:30:05.080]  few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much get healthy and
[02:30:05.080 --> 02:30:10.440]  detoxify. Most people know that iodine deficiency has been a crisis around the
[02:30:10.440 --> 02:30:15.240]  world. Iodine is key to so many of the body's functions, especially the
[02:30:15.240 --> 02:30:19.680]  thyroid. I discovered a product being developed by Dr. Group. You now know it
[02:30:19.680 --> 02:30:24.680]  as survival shield, true nascent iodine that your body can really absorb. Then
[02:30:24.680 --> 02:30:28.360]  about a year ago he said, listen, if you think this is powerful, I'm going to come
[02:30:28.360 --> 02:30:33.680]  out with rare earth, deep earth crystals. And the results that I personally have
[02:30:33.680 --> 02:30:39.480]  had have been life-changing. Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure
[02:30:39.480 --> 02:30:43.680]  crystals, ladies and gentlemen. This is innovating and the best part is it helps
[02:30:43.680 --> 02:30:47.760]  fund infowars.com, the radio show, the TV show, the whole media operation,

[02:32:03.440 --> 02:32:07.680]  world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day. But it's not just the
[02:32:07.680 --> 02:32:11.600]  air outside that's toxic. Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times
[02:32:11.600 --> 02:32:15.440]  higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air. And most Americans
[02:32:15.440 --> 02:32:19.800]  spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes. There
[02:32:19.800 --> 02:32:24.080]  are more than 42 million smokers in the United States. Well over a thousand
[02:32:24.080 --> 02:32:27.840]  types of mold in mildew linked to numerous conditions. And don't forget the
[02:32:27.840 --> 02:32:31.520]  fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well. When
[02:32:31.520 --> 02:32:35.200]  I began to research these statistics it was clear to me it was time to start
[02:32:35.200 --> 02:32:39.600]  cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot
[02:32:39.600 --> 02:32:43.840]  escape until we can fight back against made with organic and wild cultivated
[02:32:43.840 --> 02:32:48.480]  herbs and manufactured in the USA. The new Info Wars Life Lung Cleanse is here

[02:33:01.360 --> 02:33:10.120]  of the information war. It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:10.120 --> 02:33:37.480]  Last night a little Isis came up from below. She said I'm gonna bomb you and
[02:33:37.480 --> 02:34:01.240]  then Homeland Security will take over with an Isis members of Congress CIA
[02:34:01.240 --> 02:34:06.640]  people are saying Isis sleeper cells are now in the U.S. tell me something I
[02:34:06.640 --> 02:34:13.880]  didn't know and I'm sure they're being delivered the dais atomic bombs the
[02:34:13.880 --> 02:34:23.560]  hydrogen weapons. She won't sit and beg crank it up for a minute. I can't ever
[02:34:23.560 --> 02:34:30.640]  get sick a biliottle. I remember being about 11 years old and back then your
[02:34:30.640 --> 02:34:35.200]  parents would still drop you off at the mall they were so innocent and I
[02:34:35.200 --> 02:34:40.240]  remember meeting up with girls from public school and listening to that on
[02:34:40.240 --> 02:34:43.880]  the speakers in the mall that was about the happiest the happiest thing in the
[02:34:43.880 --> 02:34:49.840]  world holding a girl's hand skipping through the mall with this song playing.
[02:34:49.840 --> 02:35:10.600]  Mo mo mo. I got contacted once by Billy Idle but it never happened never got
[02:35:10.600 --> 02:35:17.080]  him on the show. I think it's about time to get Dave Mustaine back on. So I
[02:35:17.080 --> 02:35:20.360]  was listening today was talking to him on text this morning and Billy Corrigan
[02:35:20.360 --> 02:35:23.440]  I was talking to him on text I'm not name-dropping I want to get those guys on
[02:35:23.440 --> 02:35:26.920]  the air I don't want to bug him to come on air but I am big fans by the way I've
[02:35:26.920 --> 02:35:31.400]  said I want to get some more mega death and more smashing pumpkins in the
[02:35:31.400 --> 02:35:36.240]  bumpers I had smashing pumpkin years ago in the bumpers but it's like strata what
[02:35:36.240 --> 02:35:40.400]  we don't listen to for a long time or what's older gets like left and then
[02:35:40.400 --> 02:35:46.920]  whatever we put in newer ends up getting played not complaining I just need to do
[02:35:46.920 --> 02:35:52.920]  that and I've tried to analyze myself I tend to get into the third hour start
[02:35:52.920 --> 02:35:56.120]  joking around having some fun because after about two and a half hours of
[02:35:56.120 --> 02:36:00.840]  being serious I don't put on an actor on air I'm just telling you why at goofy
[02:36:00.840 --> 02:36:06.000]  after about two and a half hours being serious on average my brain just can't
[02:36:06.000 --> 02:36:11.040]  be serious anymore and just goes into R&R mode and starts having fun so I
[02:36:11.040 --> 02:36:16.040]  apologize because there I am talking about nukes going off in the US and I'm
[02:36:16.040 --> 02:36:20.480]  singing along with Billy Idol making a joke out of it I don't think it's a
[02:36:20.480 --> 02:36:26.360]  joke I'm totally upset the globalist will grab total power out of this attack
[02:36:26.360 --> 02:36:31.040]  and I'm starting to think it's gonna be atomic or nuclear and we've shown a lot
[02:36:31.040 --> 02:36:35.080]  evidence that Inhofe says that ISIS has got stuff to destroy a whole US city
[02:36:35.080 --> 02:36:40.280]  what do you think does that Obama says his number one fear is a nuclear weapon
[02:36:40.280 --> 02:36:45.600]  going off in Manhattan you got all the preparations and I said a year ago six
[02:36:45.600 --> 02:36:49.560]  months ago in a month ago I said every week they're gonna let ISIS take over
[02:36:49.560 --> 02:36:52.520]  the Middle East they're gonna attack Europe and attack the United States and
[02:36:52.520 --> 02:36:55.520]  shoot down airplanes with the heat-seeking missiles they've been given
[02:36:55.520 --> 02:36:59.880]  and and and I will be attacked when it happens probably arrested or killed I
[02:36:59.880 --> 02:37:02.920]  mean it that this isn't like they're just gonna demonize me going into the
[02:37:02.920 --> 02:37:08.120]  future I mean because it'll be so powerful that I've already exposed that
[02:37:08.120 --> 02:37:10.920]  the government's behind this but they're not gonna want me running around with
[02:37:10.920 --> 02:37:13.880]  all this happens of course under the new EAS system they'll just turn off
[02:37:13.880 --> 02:37:17.600]  info wars Facebook Twitter and my YouTube folks got to be ready for this
[02:37:17.600 --> 02:37:20.520]  they've announced the internet kill switch selectively deployed against
[02:37:20.520 --> 02:37:23.720]  whoever they want you won't be going to the drugs report you won't be going to
[02:37:23.720 --> 02:37:29.000]  WorldNet daily you won't be getting Rush Limbaugh even people ask what's gonna
[02:37:29.000 --> 02:37:34.440]  happen when the newt goes off we got Mike in Canada asking that question people
[02:37:34.440 --> 02:37:38.720]  be so hurt when there's a hundred thousand dead in the crater zone two
[02:37:38.720 --> 02:37:47.080]  hundred three hundred thousand radiated around it that's a small one at ground
[02:37:47.080 --> 02:37:53.440]  zero level I said it's a big one let's say they blow up New York kills five
[02:37:53.440 --> 02:37:59.080]  million people in the epicenter wounds another five million everything
[02:37:59.080 --> 02:38:03.240]  collapses they say oh the dollar went under and everything because we were
[02:38:03.240 --> 02:38:09.720]  hit and the Russians were with Al Qaeda I mean you can just write the script and
[02:38:09.720 --> 02:38:13.920]  it'll be I don't care of Alex Jones predicted it all arrest him out dear
[02:38:13.920 --> 02:38:17.520]  him say I mean people will just get into this primitive mode if I want to kill
[02:38:17.520 --> 02:38:21.640]  somebody and the average conservative will salute Obama and Obama will say
[02:38:21.640 --> 02:38:25.440]  turn your firearms in and you're gonna turn them in yes sir do whatever they
[02:38:25.440 --> 02:38:32.160]  say because you love it talking about mainline people just just buy into
[02:38:32.160 --> 02:38:36.280]  whatever's comfortable to believe just like 16 year old girls will get in the
[02:38:36.280 --> 02:38:39.600]  car with Ted Bundy because he was wearing a suit and tie and driving a
[02:38:39.600 --> 02:38:43.080]  little cute little non-threatening car he's he told the police why he picked
[02:38:43.080 --> 02:38:46.320]  it to be non-threatening like Warren Buffett's always eating ice cream and
[02:38:46.320 --> 02:38:51.000]  I'm just a sweet little man I'm not a eugenics black-up commander with secret
[02:38:51.000 --> 02:38:59.040]  military bases now that I run oh yeah yeah up in Nebraska oh ice cream I'm
[02:38:59.040 --> 02:39:06.840]  non-threatening get in the car with me me what a sick joke it's the same thing
[02:39:06.840 --> 02:39:12.000]  with the NPR on the non-threatening all things considered brought to you by the
[02:39:12.000 --> 02:39:17.040]  Annenberg Foundation CPB Ford Foundation and Rockefeller Brothers Trust for a
[02:39:17.040 --> 02:39:29.640]  better world oh they're so liberal oh sleepy a nice quiet non-threatening voice
[02:39:29.640 --> 02:39:37.040]  everything is wonderful everything is awesome when you're part of a team
[02:39:37.040 --> 02:39:43.800]  everything is trendy when you're part of the dream
[02:39:43.800 --> 02:39:48.840]  you also do a version where everything is racist when you disagree with your
[02:39:48.840 --> 02:39:54.000]  government everything is racist everything is terrorist unless you're a
[02:39:54.000 --> 02:39:59.160]  real terrorist then we give you heat-seeking missiles
[02:39:59.360 --> 02:40:03.360]  can we queue up everything is awesome let's go to the phone calls Mike in
[02:40:03.360 --> 02:40:08.480]  Canada says Newt goes off do we still go to work oh yes they're gonna order you
[02:40:08.480 --> 02:40:13.000]  in other regions go to work shop show your strong volunteer to be part of the
[02:40:13.000 --> 02:40:18.600]  strike forces where we're sure I'll kind of did it I yes I yes they made a
[02:40:18.600 --> 02:40:23.720]  worker with a tea party and and some of the radical groups but Russia may be
[02:40:23.720 --> 02:40:28.000]  involved as well or luckily we're massing troops on their border and get
[02:40:28.000 --> 02:40:33.240]  behind the official story you're for murdering everyone but I'm sorry Mike
[02:40:33.240 --> 02:40:37.880]  you wanted to know or you wanted me to tell you my opinion go ahead I just I
[02:40:37.880 --> 02:40:44.800]  just had a terrible spot while listening to you imagine if over 230 years ago the
[02:40:44.800 --> 02:40:51.920]  America that is today founded America imagine how terrible it would be by now
[02:40:51.920 --> 02:40:57.000]  I mean thank God that at least we're becoming aware well that's right it
[02:40:57.000 --> 02:41:01.200]  wasn't perfect back then but compared now was the age of chivalry in the age of
[02:41:01.200 --> 02:41:04.600]  men compared to the age of fake men and cowards but it would never have been
[02:41:04.600 --> 02:41:08.200]  successful there were plenty of countries founded on lies and total fraud
[02:41:08.200 --> 02:41:11.840]  we're only founded on partial lies and fraud but on the greatest free market
[02:41:11.840 --> 02:41:14.880]  experiment ever done and more liberty than any other country that's why we
[02:41:14.880 --> 02:41:19.440]  had success we wouldn't be who we were today if we if we didn't have so much
[02:41:19.440 --> 02:41:24.560]  freedom but go ahead the other thing too is that I'm surprised this hasn't been
[02:41:24.560 --> 02:41:31.200]  hit on more because it's proof that Hillary Clinton and her cohort have
[02:41:31.200 --> 02:41:36.680]  been involved with ISIS because what did she say we came we saw and we
[02:41:36.680 --> 02:41:42.920]  conquered she didn't do that with the troops from America that was done by
[02:41:42.920 --> 02:41:47.040]  these same people that they're talking about now that's right she said she
[02:41:47.040 --> 02:41:52.000]  quoted Julius Caesar I came I saw or we came we saw we conquered she also came
[02:41:52.000 --> 02:42:00.160]  and laughed we came we saw he died about Muammar Gaddafi who compared to ISIS he
[02:42:00.160 --> 02:42:03.880]  had reformed for a decade given up his weapons invested his money with the West
[02:42:03.880 --> 02:42:09.200]  had you know met with Obama he bought into all of it showing how naive even
[02:42:09.200 --> 02:42:13.800]  world leaders are and they set him up and they took that country down and now
[02:42:13.800 --> 02:42:20.600]  our own government admits Libya is dozens of times worse than it was
[02:42:20.600 --> 02:42:26.320]  Muammar Gaddafi warning every Muslim leader that you're next in it in it a
[02:42:26.320 --> 02:42:31.120]  thought is laughing I mean it's such a interesting thing but what I really
[02:42:31.120 --> 02:42:34.960]  wanted to ask you Alex and I'll get it in quick I asked my buddies around here
[02:42:34.960 --> 02:42:40.080]  because I've started talking up on silver firearms the other thing the
[02:42:40.080 --> 02:42:44.240]  problem that I have those when I ask my friends I say if a nuke goes off in the
[02:42:44.240 --> 02:42:50.240]  United States because you have Obama Dick Cheney you have people in Congress
[02:42:50.240 --> 02:42:52.560]  talking about it if that was happening in Canada
[02:42:52.560 --> 02:42:57.720]  Premier Harper Premier Martin talking about us being new there would be huge
[02:42:57.720 --> 02:43:01.000]  hysteria people would be wondering what are you talking about and what are you
[02:43:01.000 --> 02:43:06.360]  doing to deal with it well if something goes off in the state should I continue
[02:43:06.360 --> 02:43:09.160]  to work or should I stay at home well here I mean we'll have to look at it at
[02:43:09.160 --> 02:43:11.880]  that point we're trying to stop that happening right now but this is a great
[02:43:11.880 --> 02:43:16.280]  call great points that you're making here Mike our media the corporate media
[02:43:16.280 --> 02:43:20.400]  the mainstream media the dinosaur media the kleptocrat media the decepticon
[02:43:20.400 --> 02:43:26.840]  media the state-run media is so ridiculous that they should be freaking
[02:43:26.840 --> 02:43:31.120]  out and asking Obama every day forever what do you mean a nuke going off in
[02:43:31.120 --> 02:43:36.600]  New York what do you mean Senator Graham telling CBS News at a press conference
[02:43:36.600 --> 02:43:42.600]  there's there's nukes loose in the US and the Carolinas or New York are about
[02:43:42.600 --> 02:43:48.480]  to be hit imminent Assad right when we announced there's missing nukes I mean
[02:43:48.480 --> 02:43:53.400]  but no they all just know to shut up because that's scary they'd rather talk
[02:43:53.400 --> 02:43:58.040]  about a house was robbed today in Austin and someone stole the kitten that was
[02:43:58.040 --> 02:44:02.200]  being given antibiotics and it may be sick top story tonight this I was watching
[02:44:02.200 --> 02:44:06.560]  the news last night and it was a missing kitten who may be sick so I wanted to
[02:44:06.560 --> 02:44:10.480]  see the weather report and before I could see the weather I had to hear about a
[02:44:10.480 --> 02:44:14.560]  missing kitten because they knew that system I'm missing kitten it's all about
[02:44:14.560 --> 02:44:19.040]  fake feel good about oh and did you get your vaccines we don't want you to get
[02:44:19.040 --> 02:44:23.960]  sick at school just all preying on people can you imagine the soft
[02:44:23.960 --> 02:44:29.560]  population when the entire financial center gets blown to hell and the and
[02:44:29.560 --> 02:44:32.600]  there will be floods of money out of the country before that happens which is
[02:44:32.600 --> 02:44:36.960]  already going on and this is only a possibility but but see what what I keep
[02:44:36.960 --> 02:44:42.120]  saying six months ago with the whole Dias emergency and then now I said if
[02:44:42.120 --> 02:44:47.360]  they start promoting nukes going off you know that they are already looking at
[02:44:47.360 --> 02:44:52.240]  deploying them and detonating them and then and see stuff goes on like
[02:44:52.240 --> 02:44:56.640]  congressmen get calls like Rand Paul and people I'm not saying that I heard about
[02:44:56.640 --> 02:44:59.480]  this from him I'm saying it was hypothetically they get calls they go
[02:44:59.480 --> 02:45:03.200]  you know it's gonna be too bad senator when the nukes go off because we've got
[02:45:03.200 --> 02:45:06.800]  intel their nukes are here and if we don't think we can politically fix
[02:45:06.800 --> 02:45:10.120]  things in this country you know the terrorists might just detonate nukes and
[02:45:10.120 --> 02:45:14.040]  we want to make sure your family gets gets out during this time it's out of
[02:45:14.040 --> 02:45:20.920]  DC you understand we want to protect you it's a very dangerous world and what do
[02:45:20.920 --> 02:45:24.680]  you do when someone's openly threatening you like that but they're
[02:45:24.680 --> 02:45:29.000]  it's for real I mean I've I've had the establishment you know that's the
[02:45:29.000 --> 02:45:33.200]  standards pitch is listen the public wants to tear you apart they hate you
[02:45:33.200 --> 02:45:36.280]  because you're successful and smart you need to join the elite and try to
[02:45:36.280 --> 02:45:39.560]  influence it from the inside and you'll be protected when all this stuff comes
[02:45:39.560 --> 02:45:43.400]  down you're absolutely right about the future there will be no America as you
[02:45:43.400 --> 02:45:47.480]  know it and you need to either leave the United States and shut up or join with
[02:45:47.480 --> 02:45:54.200]  Soran they don't say it like that but they are joining and then the offers
[02:45:54.200 --> 02:45:58.880]  come in to go to this party or go to this event or go to this corporate junket
[02:45:58.880 --> 02:46:03.760]  or folks if I told people the stuff I've been offered it I won't even tell
[02:46:03.760 --> 02:46:08.640]  people because it sounds too ridiculous believe me it's beyond being invited to
[02:46:08.640 --> 02:46:13.800]  be a keynote speaker at Oxford and then I turned that down I was offered Oxford
[02:46:13.800 --> 02:46:20.600]  and Cambridge to address the main you know deal like presidents and Gandhi
[02:46:20.600 --> 02:46:27.240]  have done and Martin Luther King I'm not bragging about that but that's the kind
[02:46:27.240 --> 02:46:30.280]  of stuff that goes on like right around the time they were saying come to
[02:46:30.280 --> 02:46:34.200]  England come to England I was also approached by super high-level people
[02:46:34.200 --> 02:46:40.240]  who said would you like to come be part of an event and I said what's that event
[02:46:40.240 --> 02:46:44.400]  they said would you switch talk about but you want to come to this event you
[02:46:44.400 --> 02:46:49.240]  there's no getting out people say why don't you tell us who told you this I
[02:46:49.240 --> 02:46:53.800]  wouldn't be told all this stuff if I told people the stuff that goes on okay
[02:46:53.800 --> 02:47:00.720]  I'm sure I'm not bragging the stuff I talk about here on air has got the
[02:47:00.720 --> 02:47:04.960]  establishment's attention you know why because they want to know how I know
[02:47:04.960 --> 02:47:11.280]  all this stuff they want to know why I understand them and it's not magic I
[02:47:11.280 --> 02:47:14.280]  studied enough history and watch how they operate and see all the different
[02:47:14.280 --> 02:47:20.040]  angles of it you can see what they're doing so I mean I'm just here to tell
[02:47:20.040 --> 02:47:24.480]  everybody this is real thank you Mike great caller yeah you out I mean you
[02:47:24.480 --> 02:47:29.880]  asked me what do you do I don't know I'm so busy running my operation and fighting
[02:47:29.880 --> 02:47:32.760]  these people I don't have all the preparations in place for my family I
[02:47:32.760 --> 02:47:40.280]  got a wall around the house a well some solar stuff like that but I don't have
[02:47:40.280 --> 02:47:46.640]  my family in order I can't even run my own life
[02:47:47.200 --> 02:47:52.800]  properly I mean most people see my family and say it's going great no I feel
[02:47:52.800 --> 02:47:56.400]  guilty every minute of the day that I'm not just taking care of my family and
[02:47:56.400 --> 02:48:02.360]  getting out of here but that's an animal level in in instinct to run but
[02:48:02.360 --> 02:48:06.400]  every day it gnaws at me every day I get angry every day I get upset about it
[02:48:06.400 --> 02:48:10.840]  because I'm just staying here in place while I see the water rising because I
[02:48:10.840 --> 02:48:14.040]  know I got to wait till the tank goes all the way full that's when the latch
[02:48:14.040 --> 02:48:17.280]  opens when we got a chance to get out of here I got to be in the tank when
[02:48:17.280 --> 02:48:21.280]  people finally can't breathe and I go what do we do then we can get out of the
[02:48:21.280 --> 02:48:25.480]  tank it's like a Houdini trick you can't get to the latch it doesn't trigger till
[02:48:25.480 --> 02:48:29.000]  the tank's completely full and the lights go off then you got to control
[02:48:29.000 --> 02:48:34.920]  yourself not panic get in there and try to get out it's at the crisis point that
[02:48:34.920 --> 02:48:39.160]  we've got to be in place all of us for the maximum effort and I believe God
[02:48:39.160 --> 02:48:46.480]  will guide us at that point with the answers of what needs to be done but I
[02:48:46.480 --> 02:48:53.240]  mean this is all real I know it's real I mean I've you know been approached by
[02:48:53.240 --> 02:48:55.800]  multiple angles
[02:48:58.920 --> 02:49:03.720]  and so I just hope everybody understands folks that there's a real you think 9-11
[02:49:03.720 --> 02:49:08.640]  was big I told you something much bigger is coming 13 years ago probably nuclear
[02:49:08.640 --> 02:49:12.920]  and now you see them promoting it just like before 9-11 they were saying get
[02:49:12.920 --> 02:49:15.440]  ready for terror attacks give your rights up when it happens they're now
[02:49:15.440 --> 02:49:19.640]  preparatory they're now getting everybody ready when it comes to our
[02:49:19.640 --> 02:49:26.920]  security with the prospect of a nuclear weapon going off in Manhattan which is
[02:49:26.920 --> 02:49:31.200]  part of the reason why all right let's go to Jason and Tennessee thanks for
[02:49:31.200 --> 02:49:36.720]  holding listening on 14 70 a.m. WBCR on our oldest affiliates you're on the
[02:49:36.720 --> 02:49:42.000]  air Jason Alex can you hear me yes sir thanks for putting up with me what
[02:49:42.000 --> 02:49:45.440]  what's your point it's wonderful talking and I just want to let you know I've
[02:49:45.440 --> 02:49:50.520]  been praying for you and your whole crew and y'all do great work but I was the
[02:49:50.520 --> 02:49:55.440]  chief engineer at a hotel for seven years and there was an army contractor
[02:49:55.440 --> 02:49:59.360]  that stayed there all the time he was there as about as much as he was in
[02:49:59.360 --> 02:50:04.760]  Afghanistan and he said that you know you talk about the fever camps and all
[02:50:04.760 --> 02:50:10.440]  that they said that when the collapse comes but basically anybody who makes
[02:50:10.440 --> 02:50:17.200]  less than $100,000 a year is going to be put in the camps that was what
[02:50:17.200 --> 02:50:23.240]  straight out of his mouth and he was he was very connected so we're speaking
[02:50:23.240 --> 02:50:30.120]  and it's gonna be worse than that and when they're done it's just the end of
[02:50:30.120 --> 02:50:33.840]  everything they want to break this country forever I want to hear more

[02:54:25.200 --> 02:54:30.840]  yes the show is sensational yes it's absolutely out of control yes it's
[02:54:30.840 --> 02:54:37.440]  based on the near future reality that we're living in the government is
[02:54:37.440 --> 02:54:42.480]  making preparations for a nuke to go off in the u.s. and allowing ISIS to come
[02:54:42.480 --> 02:54:46.320]  into the country who's clearly infiltrating at every level it is a
[02:54:46.320 --> 02:54:50.800]  Saudi Arabian deal with the globalist that he stabilized the country and
[02:54:50.800 --> 02:54:55.280]  Jason in Tennessee so you would talk to this I think you said your words high
[02:54:55.280 --> 02:55:00.400]  level army or military contractor who stayed in the hotel a lot of the time
[02:55:00.400 --> 02:55:04.960]  and did he say at first-hand knowledge of the FEMA camps or was that his opinion
[02:55:04.960 --> 02:55:08.160]  about anybody making less than a hundred thousand dollars a year would be put in
[02:55:08.160 --> 02:55:14.720]  one no he seemed to have first-hand knowledge but he had heard it and he
[02:55:14.720 --> 02:55:20.040]  knew it see there's a smoking area outside the hotel where all the
[02:55:20.040 --> 02:55:25.320]  housekeepers will go smoke and he you know that the customers would go smoke
[02:55:25.320 --> 02:55:30.200]  there too and he would hear them talking you know political stuff and most of it
[02:55:30.200 --> 02:55:34.760]  what they heard from me because I because I listened to yourself and he
[02:55:34.760 --> 02:55:37.920]  couldn't believe that what that they knew what they knew and he couldn't
[02:55:37.920 --> 02:55:43.480]  believe it but uh yeah he confided in me he told me that basically the plan is
[02:55:43.480 --> 02:55:46.640]  anybody making less than one hundred thousand dollars a year is going to the
[02:55:46.640 --> 02:55:51.120]  camp when the when the nuke goes off or the biological weapon or whatever their
[02:55:51.120 --> 02:55:54.200]  plan is well that's what they tell people because they know most of the
[02:55:54.200 --> 02:55:57.040]  contractors are making more of that so they feel like they're part of the
[02:55:57.040 --> 02:56:00.800]  establishment you're gonna have all sorts of people that are working class
[02:56:00.800 --> 02:56:04.840]  that have special security badges that are allowed to go and come it's basically
[02:56:04.840 --> 02:56:07.600]  anybody they want they're gonna grab and throw in these things it's like they
[02:56:07.600 --> 02:56:11.120]  tell the professors we're gonna release a bio weapon down the road and it's gonna
[02:56:11.120 --> 02:56:16.600]  kill 90% but you're gonna be given the cure now higher level ones because I've
[02:56:16.600 --> 02:56:19.880]  talked to them and they've been out there on air no they've been told no
[02:56:19.880 --> 02:56:24.120]  everybody's gonna die and they're like it's okay it's for the earth I'm ready
[02:56:24.120 --> 02:56:28.480]  to die my family's ready to die like dr. pianca said that on the news I know I
[02:56:28.480 --> 02:56:33.160]  have to die my family does too and when it comes we're sad about it but it's for
[02:56:33.160 --> 02:56:37.720]  the earth but when you get into deeper globalist documents they plan to kill
[02:56:37.720 --> 02:56:42.640]  down to 1% now I don't know they'll ever even do that that's just what they talk
[02:56:42.640 --> 02:56:46.440]  about and they tend to try whatever they talk about but they want to get
[02:56:46.440 --> 02:56:49.720]  everything ratcheted down first they got to get rid of a few sovereign
[02:56:49.720 --> 02:56:53.560]  countries first because even though those countries are corrupted at problems
[02:56:53.560 --> 02:56:58.640]  they could put up a resistance later they could put up a resistance down the
[02:56:58.640 --> 02:57:02.920]  road to the globalist and they don't want that they want only a global state
[02:57:02.920 --> 02:57:07.920]  attacking the individual with just no way to get around it with a panopticon

[03:00:41.120 --> 03:00:46.840]  sorry Sabrina I'm sorry go ahead it's okay yeah I'm actually calling because
[03:00:46.840 --> 03:00:51.000]  years ago about like eight years ago I moved in this town this town is so small
[03:00:51.000 --> 03:00:56.280]  it doesn't have like a big like public official like a governor or anything like
[03:00:56.280 --> 03:01:00.880]  that it's that small but there's a base on here that's a reserve base and the
[03:01:00.880 --> 03:01:04.840]  reserve base would only have like one or two Hummer trucks in there and I noticed
[03:01:04.840 --> 03:01:08.160]  about like I don't know about a year ago or so they started like putting more
[03:01:08.160 --> 03:01:12.720]  vehicles in there and that was really more they were high-tech and stuff and
[03:01:12.720 --> 03:01:16.800]  I was like what the heck is going on and then I think it was probably like within
[03:01:16.800 --> 03:01:22.080]  this past week I found stuff on the internet for them looking for positions
[03:01:22.080 --> 03:01:27.360]  for people still positions over there that for martial law enforcers and stuff
[03:01:27.360 --> 03:01:31.040]  I found all sorts of strange stuff on here about that about the government
[03:01:31.040 --> 03:01:34.200]  looking for all types of jobs like that yeah well that's on the feds fed biz
[03:01:34.200 --> 03:01:37.920]  ops they're hiring for foreign operations and domestic internment
[03:01:37.920 --> 03:01:43.560]  specialists at metric levels 10 20 30 times depending on which area it is that
[03:01:43.560 --> 03:01:47.720]  we've ever seen there's just a massive buildup for domestic suppression while
[03:01:47.720 --> 03:01:50.960]  the government starts talking about ISIS hitting us and nukes going off and they
[03:01:50.960 --> 03:01:55.160]  armed ISIS and they're protecting them I mean it's 2 plus 2 equals 4 it makes me
[03:01:55.160 --> 03:01:58.640]  want to throw up God bless you I appreciate your call I think it's
[03:01:58.640 --> 03:02:06.480]  it's arming ISIS is treason right there and then you add everything else to it

[03:02:20.720 --> 03:02:26.000]  your listeners aware of a radio show that took place here in the Detroit area
[03:02:26.000 --> 03:02:37.040]  last week on a faith talk it's WLQV faith talk 1500 a trucker called in they
[03:02:37.040 --> 03:02:40.800]  were discussing on that radio show all of the stuff that was going on a
[03:02:40.800 --> 03:02:45.760]  partisan in the militarization of the police and that type of thing and a
[03:02:45.760 --> 03:02:49.960]  trucker called in on that radio show talking about how he had to make a
[03:02:49.960 --> 03:02:56.600]  delivery at a warehouse in Detroit yeah and then martial law signs fell out no
[03:02:56.600 --> 03:03:01.360]  what happened was when he pulled in there there was a it was full of tanks
[03:03:01.360 --> 03:03:07.120]  and all types of military vehicles and equipment inside there I've always heard
[03:03:07.120 --> 03:03:10.200]  the martial law thing but no I mean they are deploying the tanks they are
[03:03:10.200 --> 03:03:13.400]  deploying Bradley fighting vehicles and others all over the country that is
[03:03:13.400 --> 03:03:19.600]  confirmed sir yes sir yeah no I know I was just that the what he was talking
[03:03:19.600 --> 03:03:23.400]  about is this this warehouse and it was a homeland security guy on the inside of
[03:03:23.400 --> 03:03:28.000]  the warehouse when he pulled in there it's on the podcast if you want the yeah
[03:03:28.000 --> 03:03:32.760]  do me a favor will you email that to show tips info wars.com sir I sure will
[03:03:32.760 --> 03:03:36.560]  thank you Greg you're just awesome anything else nope that's it

[03:03:39.680 --> 03:03:45.800]  let's talk to Rico in Michigan again go ahead Rico yeah Alex how are you I'm
[03:03:45.800 --> 03:03:50.840]  all right brother it's a new listener but probably I don't seems like yours but
[03:03:50.840 --> 03:03:53.720]  it's probably been about nine months well good to have you on board brother
[03:03:53.720 --> 03:03:57.960]  we had about a minute go ahead eugenics I think that's the key to this whole
[03:03:57.960 --> 03:04:04.480]  thing because people until they really grasp that is real nothing else matters
[03:04:04.480 --> 03:04:08.120]  because they just go GMO's yeah I'll just eat organic or I'll fill them my
[03:04:08.120 --> 03:04:14.520]  water whatever but when they hit eugenics that's when I really woke up that's
[03:04:14.520 --> 03:04:18.640]  right we have a purposeful global scientific dictatorship that wants to
[03:04:18.640 --> 03:04:22.200]  dumb us down and then kill us in their own words once you know that then it all
[03:04:22.200 --> 03:04:27.000]  makes sense exactly what was it like when you discovered the real eugenics
[03:04:27.000 --> 03:04:34.840]  agenda well I start filling in my water drinking you know you're in and or you
[03:04:34.840 --> 03:04:42.240]  know going organic and and just you know I mean I'm ready to go but I don't want
[03:04:42.240 --> 03:04:47.000]  to well good job brother we appreciate you spread the word about liberty
[03:04:47.000 --> 03:04:50.200]  everybody else is telling the truth and please spread the word about prison
