[00:00.000 --> 00:12.080]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.080 --> 00:20.840]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.840 --> 00:35.600]  ladies and gentlemen it is Monday the 19th day of November 2012 we have a jam packed
[00:35.600 --> 00:43.800]  radio broadcast lined up for you today Ray McGovern the former top CIA analyst who
[00:43.800 --> 00:47.880]  gave the morning briefings to Ronald Reagan and George Herbert Walker Bush he
[00:47.880 --> 00:51.640]  is going to be joining us in about 30 minutes to give us his breakdown what's
[00:51.640 --> 00:55.600]  really happening in the Middle East namely Gaza but also there was Syria and
[00:55.600 --> 01:04.840]  Egypt then Bruce Fine Ron Paul's well top policy adviser when he was running
[01:04.840 --> 01:08.920]  for president constitutional lawyer will be coming on to talk about moves to have
[01:08.920 --> 01:13.560]  the state secede not to create a new government but use their declaration of
[01:13.560 --> 01:16.880]  independence to create whatever government they wish well we choose the
[01:16.880 --> 01:21.600]  republic we choose to re-upload the Bill of Rights Constitution declaration of
[01:21.600 --> 01:26.120]  independence because it says whatever government they see fit well we want the
[01:26.120 --> 01:29.600]  foreign Bankster occupation government now that's the best way to do this
[01:29.600 --> 01:34.080]  non-violently and if the states line up and put that story out the public it
[01:34.080 --> 01:37.280]  isn't about slavery or something as the media has tried to spin it totally
[01:37.280 --> 01:42.720]  asinine then we will win in the hearts and minds of the public the media will
[01:42.720 --> 01:46.800]  try to script it that it's radicals who want their own countries or want to
[01:46.800 --> 01:49.800]  return to slavery you've seen those bizarre statements out there that make
[01:49.800 --> 01:54.000]  obviously no sense we want to return to the republic and an end to the corrupt
[01:54.000 --> 01:59.840]  empire that's bankrupting us by design so that's coming up with Bruce Fine Paul
[01:59.840 --> 02:04.040]  Watson will pop in today kicks off the national opt-out of the naked body
[02:04.040 --> 02:08.320]  scanners they've even congressional hearings last week documented that
[02:08.320 --> 02:12.280]  they're saving the naked images they were caught lying again now that it is
[02:12.280 --> 02:15.520]  giving people cancer and that the new scanners are just as bad as the old
[02:15.520 --> 02:19.720]  ones and I mean I got to tell you I saw a national poll I didn't even cover
[02:19.720 --> 02:25.840]  this yesterday but I have it here in my stack I mean we've got NBC ABC news
[02:25.840 --> 02:29.760]  Huffington Post drugs report dot com they're all kept in covering off and on
[02:29.760 --> 02:34.440]  these reports about the opt-out this was big two years ago when this happened
[02:34.440 --> 02:39.280]  and now it's happening now it's happening again and Paul Watson about a
[02:39.280 --> 02:43.000]  month ago said hey let's do this and he's been working with some activist and
[02:43.000 --> 02:47.520]  so I said okay we'll push for it and people across the political spectrum
[02:47.520 --> 02:50.920]  don't want to have their dignity violated they know it's all security
[02:50.920 --> 02:54.080]  theater they know it's all dog training a traitor train us that we're all
[02:54.080 --> 02:58.880]  basically perpetrators that were all prisoners that were all guilty until
[02:58.880 --> 03:04.720]  proven proven new world order stuges so it is about training us that we are
[03:04.720 --> 03:11.680]  bad guys that we that the state is God and we're all suspect criminals and now
[03:11.680 --> 03:16.680]  I saw an actual poll out or over 50% of people we're gonna be covering that it's
[03:16.680 --> 03:21.600]  over here in this stack look how much I've gotten the stacks today if we do a
[03:21.600 --> 03:26.120]  wide-angle shot here look at all the news I've gotten the stacks I don't think
[03:26.120 --> 03:30.320]  I've probably ever had this much stuff because if you even go over here on the
[03:30.320 --> 03:34.640]  right-hand side for prison planet TV viewers and pan over there you can see
[03:34.640 --> 03:42.440]  all of those stacks of news all of them incredibly important stories that are
[03:42.440 --> 03:46.600]  up at info wars.com and prison planet.com that are just so incredibly
[03:46.600 --> 03:50.720]  important a lot of it is from today a lot of us from yesterday I didn't get to
[03:50.720 --> 03:58.480]  things like Obama is going over to Asia and they're in one country and there's
[03:58.480 --> 04:01.880]  some little water lizards out there it looks a little bit like Komodo dragons
[04:01.880 --> 04:05.880]  they're in the same family but they don't you know they don't attack anything
[04:05.880 --> 04:09.640]  bigger than a rat and the Secret Service thought they were Komodo dragons that
[04:09.640 --> 04:13.080]  we're gonna attack the president too stupid to know Komodo dragons don't
[04:13.080 --> 04:19.760]  live there they live only only you know in one area I certainly know where around
[04:19.760 --> 04:24.640]  that you know they live there on Galapagos and are endangered so it just
[04:24.640 --> 04:28.240]  shows the total culture of fear but it's more than a culture of fear of the
[04:28.240 --> 04:32.520]  nanny state yet a guy in California over the weekend arrested he was part of
[04:32.520 --> 04:36.280]  the steampunk art movement that I see all over the place where you kind of
[04:36.280 --> 04:43.200]  dress like you're in Blade Runner but it predates Blade Runner but that's kind of
[04:43.200 --> 04:49.240]  a steampunk look you got some big boots on you know weird futuristic boots you
[04:49.240 --> 04:54.080]  know trendy watch well they arrested the guy and they're charging him for a
[04:54.080 --> 04:58.200]  digital watch saying any digital watch could be a bomb detonator so you'll all
[04:58.200 --> 05:02.240]  go to jail for that now millions of people are going to get sick this winter

[09:06.880 --> 09:15.040]  the second American revolution that has gone absolutely supernova viral thanks
[09:15.040 --> 09:21.400]  to viewers and radio listeners out there like you having the same ideas in
[09:21.400 --> 09:26.240]  your minds and heart that I have and also a drudgereport.com posting it for
[09:26.240 --> 09:31.400]  three days those videos have gone very very viral and and now it's putting the
[09:31.400 --> 09:37.480]  idea out there not just of state nullification not just of states rights
[09:37.480 --> 09:42.320]  but that's the states created the Federalist system and now that the
[09:42.320 --> 09:46.760]  federal government's been hijacked the Declaration of Independence says and so
[09:46.760 --> 09:51.960]  does the Bill of Rights Ninth and Tenth Amendment that those powers not you
[09:51.960 --> 09:55.120]  know expressly given of the federal government there's only three powers
[09:55.120 --> 09:59.760]  there are reserved the states and the people but the Ninth Amendment goes on
[09:59.760 --> 10:04.920]  to say hey not just the states in the tenth we the people inherently hold all
[10:04.920 --> 10:11.160]  of that legal power to abolish this whenever we see fit and anything not
[10:11.160 --> 10:18.040]  named here is also our rights it's a double backup proviso written by some
[10:18.040 --> 10:23.040]  of the best lawyers and statesmen and philosophers and inventors and historians
[10:23.040 --> 10:30.960]  the world has ever seen or had ever seen and so I do intend next week to
[10:30.960 --> 10:39.080]  continue and of course throughout this week to put together pieces you know
[10:39.080 --> 10:44.120]  that show common law Magna Carta Declaration of Independence Bill of
[10:44.120 --> 10:52.200]  Rights Constitution and show where the legal authority in spades lies we're
[10:52.200 --> 10:55.640]  gonna talk about that with the one of the top constitutional advisors to
[10:55.640 --> 11:04.920]  Congress lawyer and of course doctor of law Bruce Fine he will be joining us
[11:04.920 --> 11:11.800]  coming up in about 50 minutes from now and we're gonna have Doc Wallek I can't
[11:11.800 --> 11:16.000]  wait to do this in studio finally meeting in person to talk about a host of
[11:16.000 --> 11:21.080]  different news issues that are out there and why are we seeing an illness
[11:21.080 --> 11:25.760]  epidemic in this country and we'll also be able to open the phones up some for
[11:25.760 --> 11:33.680]  him while he's here now all of that all of that said obviously I'm gonna get
[11:33.680 --> 11:38.520]  into the Gaza situation and we're gonna get into the economic situation that I
[11:38.520 --> 11:42.240]  mentioned some yesterday but that we've got to get to more today because it's
[11:42.240 --> 11:46.920]  really ripening towards a new global crisis that they'll use to give the
[11:46.920 --> 11:52.680]  new world order more power as they hold us hostage financially and then I have
[11:52.680 --> 11:56.560]  the big stack of news Paul Watson will be popping out at the bottom of the next
[11:56.560 --> 12:03.080]  hour after Fine leaves us I gotta say great job again to our listeners great
[12:03.080 --> 12:08.880]  job to all the media out there you know I said a month ago and I said last week
[12:08.880 --> 12:13.440]  look this is not about Alex Jones this is not about Paul Watson this is not
[12:13.440 --> 12:18.840]  about Matt Drudge this is not about Rush Limbaugh this is not about Rachel
[12:18.840 --> 12:28.080]  Maddow this is not about Ron Paul did I say Ron Paul this is about being able to
[12:28.080 --> 12:32.520]  fly places and not be drug off to a private room and have people rip your
[12:32.520 --> 12:38.480]  colostomy bag off for your examine your hysterectomy stitches or pull bandages
[12:38.480 --> 12:42.840]  off of you or try to make old ladies going home to die in Michigan get out
[12:42.840 --> 12:48.040]  of their wheelchair this is about our dignity and it's about the federal
[12:48.040 --> 12:52.760]  government creating a new goon force 11 years ago putting in naked body
[12:52.760 --> 12:59.200]  scanners with all the cancer clusters for the TSA and now arresting people for
[12:59.200 --> 13:04.960]  their shampoo bottle arresting people for their digital watch saying your
[13:04.960 --> 13:09.800]  digital watch you have no criminal record no affiliation with terrorist the
[13:09.800 --> 13:14.360]  government got the underwear bomber on the plane this has all been used to
[13:14.360 --> 13:18.200]  take over our society now the TSA is rolling out in the streets the highways
[13:18.200 --> 13:23.920]  you name it this is about a power grab
[13:26.880 --> 13:34.320]  and we left right center constitutionalist libertarian Muslim Jew
[13:34.320 --> 13:43.040]  Christian atheist agnostic theist deist we have all got to come together for
[13:43.040 --> 13:50.040]  basic human freedom hang together or hang separate and we've got to say no to
[13:50.040 --> 13:54.480]  the oppressive things that are happening and this is all political
[13:54.480 --> 13:59.200]  correctness you know they won't make a Muslim woman take their head covering
[13:59.200 --> 14:06.600]  off what do they call those burkas at the airports they won't do it in France
[14:06.600 --> 14:10.360]  either they won't do it in England but they will take your wife in a closed
[14:10.360 --> 14:14.320]  room and stick their hands especially if she's a good-looking woman because
[14:14.320 --> 14:19.880]  that's what they're after this is on record into her underwear and into her
[14:19.880 --> 14:25.840]  body they will grab a governor's genitals in front of you and squeeze them to make
[14:25.840 --> 14:30.680]  sure they're not bombs while laughing saying we gonna get photo with the
[14:30.680 --> 14:37.400]  governor that is literally a quote of what I heard this is the type of stuff
[14:37.400 --> 14:41.840]  that I have witnessed with my eyeballs and remember two and a half years ago
[14:41.840 --> 14:45.800]  TSA would deny they were doing the strip searches they would deny they were
[14:45.800 --> 14:51.800]  doing the grope downs they would deny all of these things that they are now
[14:51.800 --> 15:00.320]  doing and we're doing and now we've got confirmed reports up at info wars calm
[15:00.320 --> 15:08.680]  and prison planet calm today where the TSA are covering their badge numbers or
[15:08.680 --> 15:15.360]  inverting them as if we can't read upside down because we have a national
[15:15.360 --> 15:18.440]  poll the Huffington Post is reporting on it guys it's over there in my stack
[15:18.440 --> 15:22.360]  there's a new article out on it there's a separate article out in fact I'm it's
[15:22.360 --> 15:25.680]  on my phone actually have it punched up I meant to tell you when I got into the
[15:25.680 --> 15:29.240]  office but I got distracted four or five different ways so I didn't get all the
[15:29.240 --> 15:33.360]  preparation done I wanted to I get ready at home and come in an hour before and
[15:33.360 --> 15:39.080]  I got distracted but we it's something like I think 52% of Americans to film
[15:39.080 --> 15:46.240]  TSA and I was 52% to opt out of body scans film TSA and it's a poll and I
[15:46.240 --> 15:51.440]  need that here actually you just hand me my little digital tracker slave grid
[15:51.440 --> 15:56.280]  iPhone right over there in the stack yeah just know that it's the other one
[15:56.280 --> 16:02.600]  thank you very much thank you and I can just get it here this way I meant to get
[16:02.600 --> 16:08.680]  to that but was unable to yeah here it is 56% so my memory was failing because I
[16:08.680 --> 16:13.880]  got distracted a bunch when I got in 56% of travelers say they'll opt out of TSA
[16:13.880 --> 16:23.600]  scanners next week and that is a poll that is being carried by the Huffington
[16:23.600 --> 16:29.080]  Post five reasons I'm opting out of the TSA scanners and you should too and this
[16:29.080 --> 16:32.440]  is the type of attitude that's going to save America and the rest of the world
[16:32.440 --> 16:37.760]  when you've got the icon of libertarian constitutional you know real
[16:37.760 --> 16:43.760]  conservatism drudgereport.com and then you've got the AOL Time Warner run
[16:43.760 --> 16:49.760]  George Soros originally funded Huffington Post
[16:49.800 --> 16:55.520]  they're over there saying they don't like the TSA because everyone hates it
[16:55.520 --> 17:00.640]  everyone knows it's a fraud that I talked to and we're sick of it we want to be
[17:00.640 --> 17:03.600]  able to travel in dignity and you know what we'd rather face the danger of
[17:03.600 --> 17:10.960]  al-Qaeda the al-Qaeda Libya was turned over to and now Syria that NATO and our
[17:10.960 --> 17:17.000]  government publicly runs we're sick of it we're done with it we've had enough of
[17:17.000 --> 17:21.320]  it and so we'll cover that more with Watson next week is one of the busiest
[17:21.320 --> 17:24.520]  of the year for travel this came out last Friday and the last thing you'll
[17:24.520 --> 17:27.960]  probably want to see at the airport when you fly home for Thanksgiving is a long
[17:27.960 --> 17:32.480]  line especially one that's preventable but this year it's different this
[17:32.480 --> 17:36.920]  Thanksgiving I'm telling the TSA agents who screen me I won't walk through their
[17:36.920 --> 17:40.480]  full body scanners and what came out in congressional hearings last week we
[17:40.480 --> 17:44.160]  wrote articles about it was in mainstream news they lied about saving the
[17:44.160 --> 17:48.400]  naked images that that was all a lie of course it was and they lied about the
[17:48.400 --> 17:53.000]  radiation test folks because they see you as the enemy and I'm sick of blaming
[17:53.000 --> 17:57.760]  the TSA people ten years ago the TSA folks were just people that wanted $25
[17:57.760 --> 18:01.120]  an hour it's actually pretty good pay I call them you know McDonald's level
[18:01.120 --> 18:04.480]  employees well that's the training but they they actually get cool pretty good
[18:04.480 --> 18:08.840]  little paycheck for the you know two-week training course I give them a
[18:08.840 --> 18:12.000]  one-day training course they could to particularly tell what you're lying or
[18:12.000 --> 18:15.640]  not now they're now they're you know truth tellers I mean only the most
[18:15.640 --> 18:19.880]  gifted people with years of training can really tell if somebody's lying or not
[18:19.880 --> 18:24.200]  and then that's not a hundred percent because even if you feel guilty and feel
[18:24.200 --> 18:27.320]  like you're on the spot you'll act like you're guilty same thing with met with a
[18:27.320 --> 18:32.480]  lie detectors incredibly gifted people have trouble really using a lie detector
[18:32.480 --> 18:37.280]  machine to tell of your lying that's why they're inadmissible in court and then
[18:37.280 --> 18:41.080]  what if the government's corrupt and lying and saying a lie detector said
[18:41.080 --> 18:44.880]  you were guilty and we know that's happened same thing with DNA they've
[18:44.880 --> 18:48.600]  got all our DNA of your 40 years or younger it's 40 years now worldwide it's
[18:48.600 --> 18:51.720]  happened and all the globalist controlled nations most nations they've
[18:51.720 --> 18:56.120]  taken your blood and put it in databases at birth they take ampoules folks not
[18:56.120 --> 18:59.720]  just the little you know little drops they put you know why don't you do the
[18:59.720 --> 19:03.920]  blood test here oh we send it off to the health department it's the law they lie
[19:03.920 --> 19:09.320]  and say it isn't the law but side issue the TSA wasn't bad up front now though
[19:09.320 --> 19:12.680]  it's gotten so invasive they've run off all the reasonable people you know we're
[19:12.680 --> 19:15.360]  told they're just gonna search bags you know have a little increased security
[19:15.360 --> 19:19.640]  because a 9-11 which we know a stage but sounded reasonable and now they're on
[19:19.640 --> 19:24.480]  the highways now they're at the malls now they're at the political events now
[19:24.480 --> 19:28.880]  they're at races now they're at they're everywhere and now they admit the DNA
[19:28.880 --> 19:34.200]  database was a lie as well and they were keeping it it wasn't a blood test but
[19:34.200 --> 19:41.040]  he goes on in the article saying that there are a whole bunch of different
[19:41.040 --> 19:46.960]  activist groups that are out there saying opt out this week don't be part of it
[19:46.960 --> 19:54.120]  and film the TSA and so you've got TV stations national local you've got print
[19:54.120 --> 19:59.800]  media this thing is big and polls are showing 56% plan to opt out that's
[19:59.800 --> 20:04.800]  great we have witnessed two terrible storms in the east but we are still in

[24:21.080 --> 24:25.280]  okay finishing up with the whole tsa situation and we'll get back into it in
[24:25.280 --> 24:32.320]  about an hour with Paul Watson joining us we are kicking off the national opt
[24:32.320 --> 24:39.640]  out of the naked body scanner protest day we are kicking that off today and it's
[24:39.640 --> 24:43.760]  going to run for a week and it's important to videotape them as well but
[24:43.760 --> 24:46.520]  this is what you need to understand when you say I'm not going on the naked
[24:46.520 --> 24:51.400]  body scanner when we first called for this three years ago and this started
[24:51.400 --> 24:56.640]  three thanksgivings ago hard to believe time has moved that fast the tsa was
[24:56.640 --> 25:01.600]  saying it's the law we're going to make you where you won't fly well a there was
[25:01.600 --> 25:07.200]  no law that was another lying fraud and b for a week they just turned the
[25:07.200 --> 25:13.960]  scanners off because they don't want to give you a chance to ever say no to them
[25:13.960 --> 25:22.200]  they don't want to give you a chance to ever resist them they don't want to give
[25:22.200 --> 25:32.600]  you a chance to show the power that the people have they do not want left right
[25:32.600 --> 25:37.180]  and center and outside of that box to ever get together and realize we have
[25:37.180 --> 25:42.600]  solidarity for basic liberty the system I guarantee you hates the fact that the
[25:42.600 --> 25:49.560]  drudge report and the Huffington Post and in full wars and CBS 42 and so many
[25:49.560 --> 25:56.640]  other media outlets I mean all over the country newspaper reporters TV reporters
[25:56.640 --> 26:04.240]  radio talk show host website news directors are all saying hey let's run
[26:04.240 --> 26:11.080]  articles about this let's talk about this let's cover this let's say no to this
[26:11.080 --> 26:16.720]  that's the spirit that will bring down the globalist and that's the spirit that
[26:16.720 --> 26:24.480]  can create the secessionist movement not to create a new country but to restore
[26:24.480 --> 26:28.600]  the republic because the states made the federal government the states created
[26:28.600 --> 26:36.040]  federalism so if we have the globalist who've come in with their gaggle of
[26:36.040 --> 26:40.920]  crooks and bought off the government at every different level at the federal
[26:40.920 --> 26:43.880]  level and now they want to federalize everything because they have that federal
[26:43.880 --> 26:47.640]  beachhead we have to fight them at the state level with states rights
[26:47.640 --> 26:51.880]  constitution beloved rights lawsuits nullification but also get the
[26:51.880 --> 26:56.240]  legislatures to come together and say you know what we're just going to go
[26:56.240 --> 27:01.440]  ahead and pull out to reconstitute the federal government in an emergency
[27:01.440 --> 27:06.000]  reorganization and here's why that needs to happen and here's the key the
[27:06.000 --> 27:10.400]  globalist are bankrupting us through federal policies to bring us into a
[27:10.400 --> 27:17.680]  globalist emergency reorganization they're doing that they're bringing us
[27:17.680 --> 27:25.240]  into an emergency globalist reorganization that's what they've done in
[27:25.240 --> 27:31.120]  Europe they set up the euro 12 years ago officially 60 years ago 1957 is when
[27:31.120 --> 27:35.160]  the real treaty got signed the Treaty of Rome go read it it's online and there's
[27:35.160 --> 27:38.200]  all news articles and old photos about it happening the Treaty of Rome the
[27:38.200 --> 27:40.880]  Treaty of London a few years before that that really started it at the
[27:40.880 --> 27:46.200]  embryonic level but that was quiet Treaty of Rome but side issue and they
[27:46.200 --> 27:53.040]  are conquering us via stealth through this they've bankrupted Europe they're
[27:53.040 --> 27:55.560]  now absorbing what's left of the national sovereignty of the countries
[27:55.560 --> 28:01.360]  into a super Europe run by quote banking technocrats who want a quote hundred
[28:01.360 --> 28:06.400]  trillion in additional taxes from the Western world associated press London
[28:06.400 --> 28:10.480]  Telegraph Newsweek you name it that's what they said at Davos last year they
[28:10.480 --> 28:23.560]  want one hundred trillion dollars in additional taxpayer money one hundred
[28:26.880 --> 28:31.080]  trillion dollars of your money to fix things you notice they want round three
[28:31.080 --> 28:35.640]  of Greek bailout and most the money goes to globalist banks but then they say
[28:35.640 --> 28:41.240]  oh it's Greece's fault no no no the debt is signing on the derivatives and it's
[28:41.240 --> 28:43.880]  gonna be the same thing here so what do we do do we let them come in an
[28:43.880 --> 28:49.320]  emergency reorganizes when they've staged all this collapse to make us debt
[28:49.320 --> 28:52.640]  surf to them by signing on to their debt or do we have the states that created
[28:52.640 --> 28:56.080]  the federal government pull out to recognize it's a fraudulent instrument
[28:56.080 --> 29:00.800]  and a fraudulent takeover to then reconstitute the federal government the
[29:00.800 --> 29:04.200]  states made the federal government this to see they always want you to think
[29:04.200 --> 29:10.360]  secession is making on new country no no no it's secession it's more than
[29:10.360 --> 29:15.680]  secession it is reconstitution I think is the word a secession properly called
[29:15.680 --> 29:19.360]  but people won't know what that is if I call it a reconstitution is what do you
[29:19.360 --> 29:23.760]  when you reconstitute you put things back together we've been conquered just
[29:23.760 --> 29:27.080]  like the states are moving to block the TSA what are the feds threatened if you
[29:27.080 --> 29:32.400]  don't let our agent sees control of your travel hubs your infrastructure that's
[29:32.400 --> 29:37.080]  where occupying army does will put f-16s in the air and block air traffic throw
[29:37.080 --> 29:40.600]  me in that briar patch let's have that confrontation this isn't a
[29:40.600 --> 29:44.800]  confrontation over slavery this isn't even a confrontation over secession it's
[29:44.800 --> 29:49.880]  that we've been conquered so that's why the TSA opt out is so important we're

[34:05.960 --> 34:15.720]  tyrants is obedience to God it's Alex Jones welcome my friends again thank you
[34:15.720 --> 34:20.440]  for joining us we are 33 minutes into this worldwide transmission coming up
[34:20.440 --> 34:25.080]  constitutional lawyer advisor to Ron Paul his chief policy advisor in the
[34:25.080 --> 34:29.800]  campaign advisor to Congress Bruce Fine's going to join us I want a
[34:29.800 --> 34:35.200]  succession movement not to create a new country but to kick out the private
[34:35.200 --> 34:39.120]  Federal Reserve and the multinationals that have taken over the federal
[34:39.120 --> 34:43.400]  government that have turned our country into a system run by authoritarian
[34:43.400 --> 34:47.520]  psychopaths to quote Ron Paul and so we're going to be talking with Bruce
[34:47.520 --> 34:51.480]  Fine about that Ron Paul has come out again today Ron Paul defends growing
[34:51.480 --> 34:55.880]  successionist movement retiring congressman notes principle is deeply
[34:55.880 --> 34:59.800]  American and the states created the federal government I don't want the
[34:59.800 --> 35:03.440]  states to create a new government I want them to restore the republic very
[35:03.440 --> 35:07.600]  delicate difference there but also glaring at the same time there's a
[35:07.600 --> 35:11.280]  paradox there I'm going to try to continue my call for the second
[35:11.280 --> 35:15.680]  American Revolution against secret arrest the police state the FEMA camps the
[35:15.680 --> 35:22.280]  new army manuals that say reeducation centers in them the new bailouts they're
[35:22.280 --> 35:25.880]  going to demand when they further collapse the economy just like the same
[35:25.880 --> 35:30.240]  group of banks are doing in Europe all of that's coming up also my national
[35:30.240 --> 35:35.640]  call for opt-out week is being picked up by media across the United States from
[35:35.640 --> 35:41.480]  CBS News to the Huffington Post we're going to be covering that videos are pouring in
[35:41.480 --> 35:46.880]  of people videotaping the TSA standing up to them handing out our flyers and
[35:46.880 --> 35:52.160]  resisting this federalization prisoner training program it's basically
[35:52.160 --> 35:57.520]  Fallujah occupation training they even admit that now joining us is Ray McGovern
[35:57.520 --> 36:05.040]  for the balance of the hour the next 25 minutes and he was a top CIA analyst who
[36:05.040 --> 36:10.240]  gave morning briefings to Ronald Reagan George Herbert Walker Bush he also of
[36:10.240 --> 36:15.040]  course famously confronted globalist many times including Rumsfeld about lies
[36:15.040 --> 36:19.040]  about WMD's and nailed him when the Rumsfeld would say I never said that
[36:19.040 --> 36:24.400]  and he would quote back where Rumsfeld had said that he's no he's no stranger
[36:24.400 --> 36:29.480]  to this show he was also an army officer during Vietnam and he's fluent
[36:29.480 --> 36:33.520]  Russian German Spanish and he holds an MA in Russian from Ford University and
[36:33.520 --> 36:36.720]  certificate in theological studies from Georgetown he's also a graduate of
[36:36.720 --> 36:39.640]  Harvard Business School's advanced management program he also holds a
[36:39.640 --> 36:43.680]  certificate of theological studies from Georgetown and he's been mayor of 50
[36:43.680 --> 36:47.280]  years and he beat cancer a few years ago thanks to God's good graces and we're
[36:47.280 --> 36:50.680]  happy to have him amongst the living because he's a real patriot who spoke
[36:50.680 --> 36:54.720]  out one of the first senior intelligence officers to speak out about 9-11
[36:54.720 --> 37:00.760]  smelling of an inside job Ray great to have you always it's always though when
[37:00.760 --> 37:06.080]  we got a new war going on we have Libya turned over to Al Qaeda we have Syria now
[37:06.080 --> 37:11.760]  being attacked via Al Qaeda forces and Saudi Arabian forces out of Turkey on
[37:11.760 --> 37:17.200]  to get your take on that later you've got Gaza I mean what happened here why is
[37:17.200 --> 37:21.000]  this happening I mean I know you were a chief analyst you can give us you
[37:21.000 --> 37:27.600]  visited many times these war zones and including Gaza if a memory serves me
[37:27.600 --> 37:32.240]  when it's being bombarded of memory serves you've been part of us so many of
[37:32.240 --> 37:37.520]  these new investigations and is it because the UN was about to recognize
[37:37.520 --> 37:44.160]  Gaza and the other Palestinian areas as observer countries observer status
[37:44.160 --> 37:48.640]  giving them observer seats in the UN was it kind of like China doesn't want
[37:48.640 --> 37:53.360]  Taiwan to be recognized I mean why did this suddenly flare up because I know
[37:53.360 --> 37:57.040]  there's rockets being fired from time to time I know there's Israeli attacks from
[37:57.040 --> 38:02.000]  time to time was it because the military leader of Hamas had a peace treaty as
[38:02.000 --> 38:07.840]  Horitz newspapers reporting thank you for joining us Ray McGovern you're
[38:07.840 --> 38:12.760]  welcome Alex it's good to be back with you Gaza of course is on the front
[38:12.760 --> 38:18.720]  burner what we have here is a situation where Netanyahu is going to be running
[38:18.720 --> 38:25.320]  for reelection in January and I'm afraid that he's playing to the worst in the
[38:25.320 --> 38:31.760]  and the unreconstructed Jewish sentiment in Israel that thinks that every now and
[38:31.760 --> 38:38.080]  then you have to mow down the Palestinians like blades of grass now
[38:38.080 --> 38:43.520]  why do I say that well I'm sort of an old guy but there's some younger people
[38:43.520 --> 38:48.360]  getting out of the CIA these days and one of them is Elizabeth Murray who is
[38:48.360 --> 38:53.680]  occupying a very very senior position deputy national intelligence officer
[38:53.680 --> 39:00.840]  for the Near East and she left two years ago and I I asked her if she would
[39:00.840 --> 39:06.160]  recount some of her experiences and she did she reports that less than two years
[39:06.160 --> 39:11.600]  ago she was invited to a very very prominent think tank in Washington
[39:11.600 --> 39:16.920]  having to do with the Middle East and and the think tank was was something she
[39:16.920 --> 39:20.840]  was not willing to disclose because it was all off the record but this is what
[39:20.840 --> 39:27.280]  she talked about she said that there was a remark there made that when the death
[39:27.280 --> 39:33.240]  toll was mentioned with respect to the first attack such attack on Gaza which
[39:33.240 --> 39:37.640]  as you may remember Alex came right between the time that Barack Obama was
[39:37.640 --> 39:42.680]  elected the first time and when he took office in other words December January
[39:42.680 --> 39:47.840]  2008 9 when that happened they were discussing this and and one of the
[39:47.840 --> 39:55.040]  experts a very prominent expert on the panel smiled enigmatically and said quote
[39:55.040 --> 40:02.760]  it's unfortunate but every now and then you have to mow the lawn the lawn being
[40:02.760 --> 40:09.520]  the Palestinians now that remark which likens killing countless Palestinian
[40:09.520 --> 40:15.400]  women children and men you know likening that with trimming the grass was pretty
[40:15.400 --> 40:21.040]  egregious but instead of bringing a program there was like tittering around
[40:21.040 --> 40:28.680]  the room highly educated well-paid Middle East experts not a single one
[40:28.680 --> 40:36.040]  demurred from this black humor now that's the core of it because you Alex and
[40:36.040 --> 40:41.720]  I and your listeners are not guilty of what's happening today in Gaza but we're
[40:41.720 --> 40:47.120]  responsible we're accountable you know why because it's our government and to
[40:47.120 --> 40:52.440]  the degree we still are a democracy we are responsible for the use of our tax
[40:52.440 --> 40:57.200]  payer money going into the kind of weaponry that the Israelis are using
[40:57.200 --> 41:03.640]  f-16s all manner of other weaponry today in Gaza do you white phosphorus a lot of
[41:03.640 --> 41:08.760]  illegal stuff pardon white phosphorus is what you know was used a few years ago
[41:08.760 --> 41:14.320]  that was confirmed yeah and you know you see the bodies of children coming out
[41:14.320 --> 41:18.080]  you know and people say well that's collateral damage well it's not
[41:18.080 --> 41:22.440]  collateral damage you know I'm remembering back come old enough to
[41:22.440 --> 41:26.640]  remember the stories right after World War two and some of the prominent
[41:26.640 --> 41:31.520]  generals who asked at Nuremberg what about the children you know what they
[41:31.520 --> 41:36.040]  said they said a lot of those children witnessed what happened to their parents
[41:36.040 --> 41:40.560]  the others are not too not too old not old enough to remember but they'll hear
[41:40.560 --> 41:45.280]  the stories and so they would be against us they would oppose us so it's
[41:45.280 --> 41:50.880]  necessary to kill the children as well now am I making an invidious comparison
[41:50.880 --> 41:56.880]  I am making an invidious comparison but it happens to be not far off the mark
[41:56.880 --> 42:01.440]  they don't spare their children might as well not spare anyone because they're
[42:01.440 --> 42:06.960]  just after all blades of grass that we need to mow every four years and the
[42:06.960 --> 42:12.640]  reason we can do that a with US weaponry and be with the US president that
[42:12.640 --> 42:18.600]  really desperately needs a backbone implant you have the president defending
[42:18.600 --> 42:24.840]  this action unconscionably defending it you have the Israeli defense ministry
[42:24.840 --> 42:29.800]  yesterday saying we are so grateful for the United States because without their
[42:29.800 --> 42:35.320]  help and full support we never would be able to do this on the record they're
[42:35.320 --> 42:41.280]  bragging about it now what does that mean you want to create terrorists you
[42:41.280 --> 42:47.720]  want to have another 9-11 you want to stir up the kinds of attacks that you
[42:47.720 --> 42:52.680]  had in Benghazi well this is a this is the perfect way to do it so who profits
[42:52.680 --> 42:58.360]  from all this well this may be a little skip here but but if you ask Kuibo know
[42:58.360 --> 43:04.040]  who profits from this it's what Eisenhower warned against plus okay the
[43:04.040 --> 43:11.920]  military industrial homeland security intelligence congressional and not least
[43:11.920 --> 43:18.600]  media complex they're all in it together they all want this long war about
[43:18.600 --> 43:23.160]  which the divine Petraeus has bragged Petraeus of course you know our
[43:23.160 --> 43:26.800]  grandchildren are not going to be fighting these wars well that's really
[43:26.800 --> 43:31.960]  good for business okay and it's great business opportunities in Israel not
[43:31.960 --> 43:36.400]  only for the United States business contractor or the military contractors
[43:36.400 --> 43:40.840]  but for those in Western Europe profiteer sure well Cheney said it was
[43:40.840 --> 43:45.200]  going to be a hundred year war and that leads me to this next point regardless
[43:45.200 --> 43:49.400]  of which side people are on and and of course I understand as you just stated
[43:49.400 --> 43:52.960]  that's what I thought was happening yesterday and stated was is the military
[43:52.960 --> 43:58.280]  industrial complex it just wants new wars it doesn't care if it's not in our
[43:58.280 --> 44:02.200]  interest because they're not caring about American interest they're caring
[44:02.200 --> 44:07.800]  about weapons sales and continued profits the big mega banks are busy
[44:07.800 --> 44:12.440]  looting Europe looting the US you know we've seen Mark Fauber Jim Rogers all
[44:12.440 --> 44:16.120]  these prestigious analysts come out and say the big banks want this because it's
[44:16.120 --> 44:20.960]  a political diversion war is the health of the big state and then now if there
[44:20.960 --> 44:25.160]  is some real terror attacks or staged or underwear bombers put on planes now the
[44:25.160 --> 44:29.240]  TSA can continue what they're doing and I hear all these good old boys on talk
[44:29.240 --> 44:34.280]  radio it's one of the only racial slurs that's allowed and I hear on mainline
[44:34.280 --> 44:39.400]  talk radio where they call Arabs you know horrible pejoratives we all know
[44:39.400 --> 44:43.440]  the terms and I'll just say I'm here for documentary evidence rag head sand
[44:43.440 --> 44:48.480]  inward all of this is acceptable and I just want to tell all the good old boys
[44:48.480 --> 44:52.480]  something most of them can't pick out the countries over there they don't know
[44:52.480 --> 44:56.520]  the culture the history they don't know our government has radicalized these
[44:56.520 --> 45:02.320]  people since operation Ajax and beyond since the 50s at least the British
[45:02.320 --> 45:05.680]  before that that our government's using al-qaeda against all these other
[45:05.680 --> 45:10.320]  countries as proxies while saying give our rights up Hillary said we've got to
[45:10.320 --> 45:13.960]  go into Syria because al-qaeda is getting a foothold well yeah our government
[45:13.960 --> 45:18.040]  put them there along with France who's the chief criminal from as much as I can
[45:18.040 --> 45:22.080]  tell me I want to ask you about that just some quick questions here but my
[45:22.080 --> 45:25.880]  whole issue is it's not even that we're in the moral wrong it's now reached a
[45:25.880 --> 45:31.280]  la la land and this whole police state the globalists the megabanks they hate
[45:31.280 --> 45:36.000]  us as much as they hate the Muslims they it's not and I just and I just don't
[45:36.000 --> 45:40.000]  get how all authoritarians whether it was Hitler or Lenin or Stalin they
[45:40.000 --> 45:45.120]  always pick a minority group to set the precedent killing and I hear this talk
[45:45.120 --> 45:50.200]  I'll just mow the gas parking lot you know those are rats kill those
[45:50.200 --> 45:55.720]  Palestinian rats and I'm like whoa even if you want to side with Israel some of
[45:55.720 --> 45:58.600]  you out there okay because you know there's all these different angles
[45:58.600 --> 46:01.880]  Israel's very diverse you know there's different groups over there as well a
[46:01.880 --> 46:06.120]  lot of Israelis are against this I get that Israel's under attack people are
[46:06.120 --> 46:12.200]  always demonizing it and so people tend to pick a side getting outside of sides
[46:12.200 --> 46:19.000]  we're dehumanizing ourselves by allowing the system to say that these
[46:19.000 --> 46:22.600]  Arabs aren't humans and I'm ranting here sir but what's your take on what I've
[46:22.600 --> 46:28.760]  just said well on the last point Alex I had dinner with Miko Pelle the the
[46:28.760 --> 46:33.600]  author of the general son the general being a very prominent Israeli general
[46:33.600 --> 46:39.320]  from 1967 on and he was telling me about a book his sister has just written about
[46:39.320 --> 46:44.160]  what Israeli children learn about Palestinians and in their school books
[46:44.160 --> 46:49.640]  there are no pictures of Palestinians no pictures and no text that that
[46:49.640 --> 46:54.760]  approximates the accurate story and so by the time they get to be 18 they're
[46:54.760 --> 46:59.160]  ready to go into the IDF the Israeli Defense Forces without any notion that
[46:59.160 --> 47:03.840]  these other people are human too that's what you need you need people who don't
[47:03.840 --> 47:10.000]  look exactly like you do and you need to to best war them you know in in other
[47:10.000 --> 47:14.600]  words make them into the the demons that you need to fight now it's not gonna
[47:14.600 --> 47:19.880]  last and there is a little good news Alex I'm happy to report to you okay the
[47:19.880 --> 47:25.240]  Washington Post today first column head headline everyone have it well do I have
[47:25.240 --> 47:33.680]  right here no I don't Israeli attacks family killing 12 civilian toll up I
[47:33.680 --> 47:37.600]  don't know how they allowed this into the Washington Post but there it is so
[47:37.600 --> 47:41.480]  we're getting a little bit more news coverage I want to follow that up by
[47:41.480 --> 47:49.480]  saying that Fox News CBS News some of the other main news bureaus are being led
[47:49.480 --> 47:54.520]  in from Egypt into Gaza this is new this was not allowed the last time okay
[47:54.520 --> 47:59.440]  now true the Israelis are bombing the towers from which people can trip can
[47:59.440 --> 48:04.200]  transmit emails and others but still people are going in so my suggestion
[48:04.200 --> 48:09.640]  Alex is get your videographers together get on the next plane to Cairo get into
[48:09.640 --> 48:14.640]  Gaza and broadcast directly from there until the truth the American people who
[48:14.640 --> 48:18.200]  have a huge audience let them know what's really going to happen before even
[48:18.200 --> 48:23.240]  worse happens and what I'm afraid of is an Israeli army invasion as you know
[48:23.240 --> 48:28.440]  they've called up 17,000 army troops and they're poised on the border and they're
[48:28.440 --> 48:32.800]  going to most more grass unless people like us speak up well that's the other
[48:32.800 --> 48:38.800]  issue if these Palestinians are dogs our rats our grass like the like the
[48:38.800 --> 48:43.720]  insiders say in these meetings why not let us see it then I mean why why is
[48:43.720 --> 48:47.560]  Israel bombing the TV stations and the and the and the and the civilian
[48:47.560 --> 48:52.160]  infrastructure because they don't want these images coming out and if it is so
[48:52.160 --> 48:55.560]  beautiful I mean I tell all these good old boys that say yeah let's you know
[48:55.560 --> 49:00.400]  kill some Arabs while our troops over there breathing do you I say you want
[49:00.400 --> 49:04.160]  to go over because I've seen our army troops in the in the film footage that
[49:04.160 --> 49:08.480]  you know crying when they you know see little kids with their bottom half blown
[49:08.480 --> 49:12.400]  off begging for mommy I mean all these tough guys why don't they go over and
[49:12.400 --> 49:16.520]  see some kids with their lower halves blown off begging for mama instead of
[49:16.520 --> 49:20.120]  just saying you know they're not human kill them I mean it's disgusting to hear
[49:20.120 --> 49:24.920]  these tough guys getting off on this well Alex you put your finger on another
[49:24.920 --> 49:30.880]  reality here and that is that the top military brass in this country with the
[49:30.880 --> 49:36.280]  possible exception of General Dempsey for whom I have some respect are just like
[49:36.280 --> 49:42.520]  the top military brass during Vietnam now George Ball who was under Secretary of
[49:42.520 --> 49:46.520]  State at the time and was right in with the air all the policy making it was
[49:46.520 --> 49:53.240]  going on describe the Joint Chiefs of Staff under John Kennedy as a sewer of
[49:53.240 --> 50:02.360]  deceit sewer of deceit in quotes now how about these demigods like Petraeus like
[50:02.360 --> 50:07.480]  General Allen what about them well I don't really care about their sexual
[50:07.480 --> 50:12.080]  discretion indiscretions except what it means I mean Allen's a Marine right
[50:12.080 --> 50:17.560]  center if you daily so always faithful well except your wife partly but what
[50:17.560 --> 50:21.920]  it means to me is these guys have a different orientation like they they
[50:21.920 --> 50:26.040]  don't see the broken babies they don't see the people killed they're interested
[50:26.040 --> 50:29.760]  in seeing yet another star now you all have four stars but they can still get
[50:29.760 --> 50:34.400]  some spaghetti some merit badges or whatever it is that Petraeus sticks on
[50:34.400 --> 50:38.720]  his and they're running around with a bunch of carts I mean this is what they
[50:38.720 --> 50:43.240]  do while people are dying the troops are being ill-paid everything's falling
[50:43.240 --> 50:47.840]  apart on record they're running around horn mongering boy these are real men
[50:47.840 --> 50:54.200]  at you know at literally they are above the battle so to speak I'm above the
[50:54.200 --> 50:58.160]  battle so if they're above the battle they can indulge in these kinds of things
[50:58.160 --> 51:02.840]  you know people say well Ray don't be sanctimonious for God's sake and I'm not
[51:02.840 --> 51:06.920]  trying to be and don't be vindictive I'm not trying to be vindictive I saw what
[51:06.920 --> 51:10.960]  happened to my friends in Vietnam okay you don't have to be vindictive to be
[51:10.960 --> 51:15.320]  just okay and when you watch what's going on my god you know
[51:15.320 --> 51:21.240]  we'll take take Petraeus we know that he was well we know that it took two oaths
[51:21.240 --> 51:26.640]  right one oath to his wife in marriage one oath to the Constitution okay now
[51:26.640 --> 51:30.880]  if he lies about progress in the war if he knows full well he's a bright guy okay
[51:30.880 --> 51:34.560]  he knows full well that he's lying when he says there's been progress but it's
[51:34.560 --> 51:40.280]  tentative and it's reversible he said that about 18 times in Congress all goes
[51:40.280 --> 51:45.520]  oh oh oh so he's lying about that but he's being unfaithful to his wife what's
[51:45.520 --> 51:49.640]  that mean well there's a Bible verse it says it's out of Luke I think and it
[51:49.640 --> 51:55.320]  says that he that cannot be trusted in small things should not be given power
[51:55.320 --> 51:59.960]  over larger things now there is some truth to that and to the degree the
[51:59.960 --> 52:04.320]  American people have been brainwashed into think these guys are heroes to the
[52:04.320 --> 52:07.240]  degree they can think well what's that faithful and sympathy they listen to
[52:07.240 --> 52:10.960]  always fit well these guys weren't faithful here do you think it might be
[52:10.960 --> 52:15.640]  possible that they're lying to us about the war wow well they are lying to us
[52:15.640 --> 52:20.440]  about the war and there's not one good reason why any person any person should
[52:20.440 --> 52:24.600]  die in Afghanistan from now on all the troops should be out of there right away
[52:24.600 --> 52:30.360]  we should stop killing them and they'll stop killing us unless they put al-Qaeda
[52:30.360 --> 52:33.600]  in everywhere I said when they were taking over Libya starting two years ago
[52:33.600 --> 52:40.040]  that I said within two years I said you watch will be hearing we have to invade
[52:40.040 --> 52:43.520]  all of Africa because of al-Qaeda it didn't even take two years a year and a
[52:43.520 --> 52:47.240]  half after all this started they are now I can pull up the Washington post
[52:47.240 --> 52:52.920]  headlines you name it you know Hillary says al-Qaeda in Syria oh my gosh al-Qaeda
[52:52.920 --> 52:57.520]  flag in Libya I mean how dumb do they think we are that the same al-Qaeda they
[52:57.520 --> 53:00.680]  used in the 80s against the Russians that they use in the 90s against the
[53:00.680 --> 53:06.400]  Serbs to get a war started up are now being put in thousands of missiles are
[53:06.400 --> 53:09.520]  missing I want to get your take on that what you really think happened in
[53:09.520 --> 53:14.640]  Benghazi and where all of this is going and then now we're being told oh we've
[53:14.640 --> 53:19.520]  got to take your rights TSA's got to be on the streets now because al-Qaeda got
[53:19.520 --> 53:23.360]  missiles in Libya yeah because our criminal government helped them take
[53:23.360 --> 53:30.160]  over I mean you can see them creating the next group of wars it is really very
[53:30.160 --> 53:37.040]  devilish well you're right it's very interesting there are many layers to
[53:37.040 --> 53:42.640]  the Benghazi thing let's start with my friend Hillary Clinton who had her go
[53:42.640 --> 53:46.320]  and speak me up real bad they're just two years ago while she was giving a
[53:46.320 --> 53:51.520]  speech all I did was stand up silently and turn my back on her so she's not my
[53:51.520 --> 53:57.760]  favorite person but let's take what she said after Benghazi we free those
[53:57.760 --> 54:02.600]  people we helped them achieve independence from Qaddafi how could they
[54:02.600 --> 54:06.960]  turn on us like this I don't understand it well she's smart enough to understand
[54:06.960 --> 54:12.000]  it when you bomb the hell out of a country when you kick down doors in the
[54:12.000 --> 54:17.480]  middle of the night when you do we don't say regime overthrow anyone we say
[54:17.480 --> 54:23.960]  regime change when you do regime change and results in the despicable death of
[54:23.960 --> 54:29.680]  a whether he's hated or loved dictator you don't do what you did what they did
[54:29.680 --> 54:35.520]  what these French mostly did to Qaddafi and to Salam Hussein for that matter you
[54:35.520 --> 54:38.560]  know you don't do that if you're a civilized animal okay so when all this
[54:38.560 --> 54:43.320]  happens guess what people are not gonna like you they're gonna be all kinds of
[54:43.320 --> 54:47.960]  people that don't like you and if you don't have a plan we're still if you
[54:47.960 --> 54:52.640]  don't know who these people are out in Benghazi well you know what would you do
[54:52.640 --> 54:58.400]  where you send the CIA now it's an open secret that that wasn't a consulate in
[54:58.400 --> 55:04.880]  Benghazi that was a CIA station lots of CIA guys there what were they doing well
[55:04.880 --> 55:09.680]  they're trying to figure out trying to figure out who it was that is insurging
[55:09.680 --> 55:16.560]  there or a militant or terrorizing things okay number two it's revealed by
[55:16.560 --> 55:22.000]  Petraeus's sweetheart that they were holding prisoners there they were
[55:22.000 --> 55:26.040]  interrogating interrogating prisoners not only Libyans but other Africans now
[55:26.040 --> 55:30.560]  the torture base a black site what's the big deal there well the president
[55:30.560 --> 55:35.680]  issued an executive order as soon as he came into office saying the CIA shall no
[55:35.680 --> 55:40.920]  longer hold prisoners in black sites for interrogation or any other purchase so
[55:40.920 --> 55:48.000]  if what Paula Broadwell says and which Fox News of all places confirms there
[55:48.000 --> 55:51.960]  were prisoners in that annex or what do you want to call it and that they were
[55:51.960 --> 55:55.600]  released to Libyan authorities as everyone else that got out of dodge
[55:55.600 --> 56:00.720]  well let's you know number one has she know that is that pillow talk at number
[56:00.720 --> 56:04.520]  two is it true that they were holding prisoners and number three is it also
[56:04.520 --> 56:10.280]  true as she suggests that that was the reason they attacked the consulate now
[56:10.280 --> 56:16.080]  when Hillary Clinton you can't can't fathom what's going on and the
[56:16.080 --> 56:20.720]  Republicans hold this big hearing right before the election congressman Iser
[56:20.720 --> 56:24.760]  from California and they got a star witness and he's great big guy you know
[56:24.760 --> 56:28.720]  he says his name is George Nordstrom and he's a state department regional
[56:28.720 --> 56:33.480]  security officer and he asked for more protection and he didn't get it okay so
[56:33.480 --> 56:38.960]  what what does Nordstrom say he punches a big hole in that balloon because he
[56:38.960 --> 56:44.200]  says you know on second thought if we had six more feet of concrete around that
[56:44.200 --> 56:48.760]  and if we had six or seven and ten more Marines have still when made any
[56:48.760 --> 56:52.880]  difference they had what I've never seen in my 14 years and the diplomatic
[56:52.880 --> 56:56.840]  security sir I've never seen such an attack will equip well plan well guess
[56:56.840 --> 57:01.280]  what that's what's going to happen this is just the first of such attacks when
[57:01.280 --> 57:05.560]  you do that to people like that they get very angry and it's very easy to get
[57:05.560 --> 57:10.240]  weapons you asked about the surface to their shoulder fired surface to air
[57:10.240 --> 57:16.760]  missiles between 10,000 and 20,000 such missiles are free roaming about we don't
[57:16.760 --> 57:21.080]  know where in Libya that may be one reason why we have so many guys in
[57:21.080 --> 57:26.280]  Benghazi trying to figure out hey anybody see any shoulder fired sand missiles
[57:26.280 --> 57:30.080]  around here yeah it's so ridiculous you know if you're gonna do all these
[57:30.080 --> 57:34.280]  horrendous things at least you should have some sort of plan and know something
[57:34.280 --> 57:39.320]  about the players Hillary Clinton is a disaster in my view and the people who
[57:39.320 --> 57:44.760]  go along with her the secretary defense and the CIA guys and John Brennan who
[57:44.760 --> 57:48.560]  runs the kill list they're all bunch of war criminals let me ask you this
[57:48.560 --> 57:54.040]  briefly where do you see all of this going and and the al-Qaeda in Syria and
[57:54.040 --> 57:56.720]  all of it where where is it all headed I mean they're clearly trying to
[57:56.720 --> 58:00.880]  destabilize the whole place and get a civil war going on between shiites and
[58:00.880 --> 58:07.600]  Sunnis well the in Syria it's it's an incredible mess I don't I don't understand
[58:07.600 --> 58:11.160]  exactly what's happening there I don't think anybody understands what's
[58:11.160 --> 58:15.280]  happening there or what's likely to happen when Hillary Clinton says why we
[58:15.280 --> 58:21.160]  got to the post the head of Syria again without any plan well first off I don't
[58:21.160 --> 58:25.280]  think other countries should go around saying president Syria has to leave so
[58:25.280 --> 58:29.040]  you know there was the beginning of an average bring there I tell you what do

[01:00:04.440 --> 01:00:12.200]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[01:00:12.200 --> 01:00:19.760]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[01:00:19.760 --> 01:00:30.440]  Alex Jones all right Ray McGovern former top CIA analyst and a political
[01:00:30.440 --> 01:00:34.440]  activist civil rights activist Ray McGovern comms his website and links over
[01:00:34.440 --> 01:00:37.840]  to all the great essays he's written Ray McGovern comm should have given out
[01:00:37.840 --> 01:00:41.840]  earlier we're gonna shift gears into some other issues with Bruce Fine and
[01:00:41.840 --> 01:00:46.720]  constitutional lawyer on the whole a secession movement to re-energize the
[01:00:46.720 --> 01:00:50.400]  Republic not not destroy the Republic I'm gonna break that down with him and get
[01:00:50.400 --> 01:00:54.520]  his take on it Ray finishing up with the point you were making and then I've
[01:00:54.520 --> 01:00:59.160]  got a question for you dealing with America's moral authority go ahead Ray
[01:00:59.160 --> 01:01:02.800]  finished point you were making I think we were talking about whether Hillary
[01:01:02.800 --> 01:01:08.480]  Clinton or anyone else can protect our diplomats from the the rage that the
[01:01:08.480 --> 01:01:13.000]  people who are being oppressed by people we prop up whether we can protect
[01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:18.480]  them and we can't and to send a fellow like Ambassador Stevens a brilliant
[01:01:18.480 --> 01:01:23.320]  arabist into that kind of danger or to allow him to exist in that kind of
[01:01:23.320 --> 01:01:28.440]  danger is foolhardy in the extreme so what do we end up with we end up with
[01:01:28.440 --> 01:01:32.760]  difficulty in even having people in touch with the indigenous folks that
[01:01:32.760 --> 01:01:37.240]  they're supposed to be in touch with our reputation and and our standing in the
[01:01:37.240 --> 01:01:41.520]  world and that part of the world has plummeted not only under President Bush
[01:01:41.520 --> 01:01:46.240]  but under President Obama as well and again good old boys just say nuke
[01:01:46.240 --> 01:01:50.120]  everybody they don't understand this is all being used to take our liberties
[01:01:50.120 --> 01:01:53.280]  we've been conquered by these special entries I don't know if you've seen Ron
[01:01:53.280 --> 01:01:57.600]  Paul's farewell address but in the 49 minutes he says we are run by
[01:01:57.600 --> 01:02:01.400]  authoritarian psychopaths that's a quote that it's a premeditated
[01:02:01.400 --> 01:02:04.760]  authoritarian takeover that it's bipartisan these are all quotes
[01:02:04.760 --> 01:02:10.920]  bipartisan scientific takeover by special interest and that the general public in
[01:02:10.920 --> 01:02:15.880]  America is immoral I mean and by immoral they're decadent they're not awake sure
[01:02:15.880 --> 01:02:21.080]  there's a large minority that's awake but I mean those that know history know
[01:02:21.080 --> 01:02:28.880]  we are really really really a big giant menacing evil now and I mean do you
[01:02:28.880 --> 01:02:31.200]  agree with that statement did you see the speech and where do you think this is
[01:02:31.200 --> 01:02:37.480]  going well Alex I think when you and I get back from Gaza we got to fix this
[01:02:37.480 --> 01:02:43.600]  okay we have a new president he's got a four-year mandate a real mandate now he
[01:02:43.600 --> 01:02:49.000]  says he wants us to make him do it we've got to get out in the streets and do
[01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:54.200]  precisely that the kinds of things that he himself is responsible for
[01:02:54.200 --> 01:03:00.280]  authorizing the killing of US citizens assigning on New Year's Eve the National
[01:03:00.280 --> 01:03:05.160]  Defense Appropriate Authorization Act those kinds of things can be reversed and
[01:03:05.160 --> 01:03:10.360]  we have to make him do it the reason he did the NDAA the National Defense
[01:03:10.360 --> 01:03:15.320]  Authorization Act was because he's afraid of us and what what happened well
[01:03:15.320 --> 01:03:21.120]  not enough of us showed up to be afraid of now we have to change that Martin
[01:03:21.120 --> 01:03:26.000]  Luther King famously said sometimes you have to put your body into it that's
[01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:34.520]  what I'm gonna do as soon as we get back from Gaza Wow you know so you want me
[01:03:34.520 --> 01:03:38.960]  to go with you to Gaza yep it's like Obi-Wan Kenobi saying you must go with me
[01:03:38.960 --> 01:03:45.760]  to Alderaan there are a lot of Western journalists getting in that's the
[01:03:45.760 --> 01:03:51.360]  difference here the last time around four years ago when the Palestinians
[01:03:51.360 --> 01:03:56.240]  suffered 1400 dead as opposed to 10 Israelis they weren't letting any
[01:03:56.240 --> 01:04:01.280]  Western journalists in the situation has changed in Egypt right now they're
[01:04:01.280 --> 01:04:06.320]  getting in I think we need to all go in there broadcast from their daily to
[01:04:06.320 --> 01:04:11.080]  prevent worse from happening because as I said before Alex there there are 17
[01:04:11.080 --> 01:04:16.280]  thousand mobilized Israelis now they're on the border I think chances are better
[01:04:16.280 --> 01:04:20.920]  than even that within the next few days they'll be invading Gaza just as they
[01:04:20.920 --> 01:04:26.720]  did four years ago well I got to tell you so I guess you're about to leave to
[01:04:26.720 --> 01:04:30.840]  Gaza you could report to us right here it's not that I'm even afraid of being
[01:04:30.840 --> 01:04:34.640]  killed it's the whole issue of traveling it's like I didn't go to
[01:04:34.640 --> 01:04:38.080]  Bilderberg in Europe last year I probably probably should have I am
[01:04:38.080 --> 01:04:41.200]  planning to start trying to travel the more of these things Ray I mean are you
[01:04:41.200 --> 01:04:46.880]  about to hop a flight to Cairo my friends are my question has to do with my
[01:04:46.880 --> 01:04:50.800]  wife's illness whether I can in good conscience leave her at this point no I

[01:09:16.520 --> 01:09:20.840]  short notice I tried to get him Friday but he's here with us here's what here's
[01:09:20.840 --> 01:09:25.400]  what's on the radio now to recap because we just started a new hour as we go to
[01:09:25.400 --> 01:09:30.320]  him I'm looking at all this and I'm not coming up with something novel or new
[01:09:30.320 --> 01:09:36.960]  but with an important twist on it or an untwist is the way I put it the media
[01:09:36.960 --> 01:09:41.240]  always sells states rights if states say they have any rights as to session
[01:09:41.240 --> 01:09:44.440]  going back to slavery you know that's like saying going back to the Roman
[01:09:44.440 --> 01:09:48.200]  Empire going back to you know going back to Adam and Eve going back to them and
[01:09:48.200 --> 01:09:52.400]  it's just totally made up in a joke if why do we even have states if there's no
[01:09:52.400 --> 01:09:55.120]  states rights 9th Amendment 10th Amendment we have a constitutional
[01:09:55.120 --> 01:09:58.920]  lawyer who advises Congress to give us his take on this but here's my basic
[01:09:58.920 --> 01:10:05.480]  idea the states created the government they created federalism they created the
[01:10:05.480 --> 01:10:08.760]  whole system we're under the Declaration of Independence states it's our
[01:10:08.760 --> 01:10:13.400]  right and duty to throw off a government when it becomes destructive well I've
[01:10:13.400 --> 01:10:17.000]  got the headline article we can put it up on screen for TV viewers radio
[01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:21.640]  listeners with the headline bankers declare they've conquered u.s. in
[01:10:21.640 --> 01:10:27.240]  Europe with dozens of video clips the news times of London AP time magazine
[01:10:27.240 --> 01:10:32.440]  saying six mega banks took over with the Federal Reserve and have signed us on
[01:10:32.440 --> 01:10:36.480]  to their derivatives and they're running the policies of bankrupting the states
[01:10:36.480 --> 01:10:39.840]  of going over the financial cliff because they stand again from rack and
[01:10:39.840 --> 01:10:44.320]  ruin because they're the ones that loan us our own money back so what we do is
[01:10:44.320 --> 01:10:49.520]  you don't just do half measures you have the states stand up and say just like
[01:10:49.520 --> 01:10:53.520]  they're saying in Texas again unanimous vote to arrest TSA when they grow up
[01:10:53.520 --> 01:10:57.040]  your genitals that's the states rights move the feds threatened to run an arm
[01:10:57.040 --> 01:11:00.960]  blockade with f-16s last year so the Senate killed it well we kicked the
[01:11:00.960 --> 01:11:03.920]  folks in the Texas Senate out that did that now the bill has been reintroduced
[01:11:03.920 --> 01:11:08.160]  we have the state rep on that did it Friday that states rights right there
[01:11:08.160 --> 01:11:11.960]  we'll take that to the next level have the states get together in a new
[01:11:11.960 --> 01:11:16.760]  constitutional convention with the states with the legislative heads to go back
[01:11:16.760 --> 01:11:20.960]  to the states and get them to pass a declaration that we don't recognize the
[01:11:20.960 --> 01:11:24.760]  current federal government and to reconstitute the federal government
[01:11:24.760 --> 01:11:31.160]  bill of rights Constitution it's a reupload and order them now this then
[01:11:31.160 --> 01:11:34.920]  you've got to break down the plan of doing that but just getting the states
[01:11:34.920 --> 01:11:40.840]  in motion to start the move towards the session to not create a new country but
[01:11:40.840 --> 01:11:45.480]  to secede to recognize we've been conquered by corporate fraudulent
[01:11:45.480 --> 01:11:49.720]  interest to reupload the bill of rights and Constitution via the Declaration of
[01:11:49.720 --> 01:11:53.600]  Independence just that bully pulpit of the states and members of the House and
[01:11:53.600 --> 01:11:58.120]  Senate federally who agree with us and others will create the movement and the
[01:11:58.120 --> 01:12:02.640]  attention in the focal point to rediscover the bill of rights Constitution
[01:12:02.640 --> 01:12:06.480]  Declaration of Independence ninth and tenth amendment and so that's my idea
[01:12:06.480 --> 01:12:09.360]  that when I say second American Revolution I'm saying it should be
[01:12:09.360 --> 01:12:12.600]  centered around the states also with beach heads in the federal government
[01:12:12.600 --> 01:12:16.080]  but the federal government itself is a globalist beachhead that's taking us
[01:12:16.080 --> 01:12:20.040]  over all right sir thank you for coming on you've heard my basic idea I'm
[01:12:20.040 --> 01:12:24.120]  throwing out there we need that focal point we need bold moves they're
[01:12:24.120 --> 01:12:29.360]  calling any states rights you know racist secessionism I say we trump that by
[01:12:29.360 --> 01:12:32.720]  saying throw me in that briar patch constitutional lawyer Bruce Fine what do
[01:12:32.720 --> 01:12:39.400]  you say sir that's a very deep question Alex and if we can move toward
[01:12:39.400 --> 01:12:44.640]  methodically I think that's the best way to do it first of all the first
[01:12:44.640 --> 01:12:50.080]  expression of state dissatisfaction with what was thought to be federal tyranny
[01:12:50.080 --> 01:12:56.400]  came in 1798 when the Congress passed the alien and tradition axon by John Adams
[01:12:56.400 --> 01:13:01.880]  and Thomas Jefferson and James Madison then a Virginia a past that what the
[01:13:01.880 --> 01:13:06.480]  orchestrator was called the Virginia and Kentucky resolution saying that in the
[01:13:06.480 --> 01:13:11.120]  opinion of the legislature the Sedition Act flouted the First Amendment by
[01:13:11.120 --> 01:13:15.960]  violating freedom of speech it among other things forbade language that
[01:13:15.960 --> 01:13:20.480]  brought the Congress or the president in to the contempt or ridicule of the
[01:13:20.480 --> 01:13:26.840]  American people and also the alien act had denied due process and ultimately
[01:13:26.840 --> 01:13:33.800]  that they both acts expired in 1800 when Mr. Jefferson was elected president but
[01:13:33.800 --> 01:13:40.560]  that was I suppose the first expression of a method of state protest against an
[01:13:40.560 --> 01:13:46.400]  over reaching federal government orchestrated by James Madison who was
[01:13:46.400 --> 01:13:50.720]  known as the father of the Constitution he was the primary a drafter at the
[01:13:50.720 --> 01:13:57.520]  convention in 1787 now there are alternate vehicles I think Alex that could
[01:13:57.520 --> 01:14:03.920]  be utilized to try to get the focus on states rights or a federal system
[01:14:03.920 --> 01:14:08.560]  reinstituted other than the one that you've suggested for these are met you
[01:14:08.560 --> 01:14:13.080]  might call adaptations first the Constitution itself in Article 5
[01:14:13.080 --> 01:14:18.840]  recognizes a power for two-thirds of the state to force Congress to summon a
[01:14:18.840 --> 01:14:25.440]  constitutional convention to revamp proposed amendments to the charter
[01:14:25.440 --> 01:14:30.960]  document and then if the convention by two-thirds votes proposes an amendment
[01:14:30.960 --> 01:14:34.200]  then it would go back to the state legislatures to be ratified by three
[01:14:34.200 --> 01:14:38.400]  quarters now this particular method has never been utilized before and amending
[01:14:38.400 --> 01:14:43.640]  the Constitution it's all followed an alternate course where two-thirds of the
[01:14:43.640 --> 01:14:47.440]  House in the Senate proposed an amendment that's submitted to the state but
[01:14:47.440 --> 01:14:52.120]  that's at least one method of doing this now what you've actually suggested
[01:14:52.120 --> 01:14:56.920]  Alex is not all that different from the process by which we segueed from the
[01:14:56.920 --> 01:15:01.280]  Articles of Confederation into the Constitution itself it was thought that
[01:15:01.280 --> 01:15:06.640]  the articles were deficient delegates met in an atlas and said well why don't
[01:15:06.640 --> 01:15:11.280]  we convene a convention to so-called revise the Articles of Confederation at
[01:15:11.280 --> 01:15:16.240]  that time we simply had a unicameral you know you're a single branch of
[01:15:16.240 --> 01:15:19.880]  government a legislative body basically it was the entire federal government had
[01:15:19.880 --> 01:15:24.160]  no authority to raise taxes or do much of anything it was quite weak and the
[01:15:24.160 --> 01:15:27.000]  delegates to the Constitutional Convention even though they were
[01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:31.520]  empowered only to revise the articles came up with our current Constitution
[01:15:31.520 --> 01:15:36.200]  under which we live proposed it to ratification to the states ultimately
[01:15:36.200 --> 01:15:41.560]  all ratified nine was essential in order to put the Constitution into motion but
[01:15:41.560 --> 01:15:47.320]  that was a way in which the existing framework of government the Articles of
[01:15:47.320 --> 01:15:52.760]  Confederation was revamped wholesale and that's what you're proposing Alex is
[01:15:52.760 --> 01:15:57.760]  a variation of that kind of methodology now the difference I suppose is that the
[01:15:57.760 --> 01:16:02.480]  articles and the government at that time was very tiny and so the transition was
[01:16:02.480 --> 01:16:07.000]  not a wrench whereas today you've got a Leviathan as the federal government it's
[01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:12.760]  everywhere where it shouldn't be and the possible resistance could be greater
[01:16:12.760 --> 01:16:17.600]  but there's nothing that would be a novel in American history that suggests
[01:16:17.600 --> 01:16:24.880]  your idea is outlandish or fringe now one of the things also I think Alex that
[01:16:24.880 --> 01:16:30.920]  has to be underscored is why is it that we think it would be a useful idea or
[01:16:30.920 --> 01:16:37.840]  exercise to revive a federalist and the reason it is twofold in my judgment first
[01:16:37.840 --> 01:16:42.920]  of all it creates competition in good government that is if one state creates
[01:16:42.920 --> 01:16:47.000]  an oppressive system the citizens can move to another state the taxes go there
[01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:52.160]  the innovation goes there and otherwise and so you have this constant feedback
[01:16:52.160 --> 01:16:57.440]  between the government and its citizens that finds expression in the places
[01:16:57.440 --> 01:17:01.400]  citizens choose to live and we see that illustrated by states that have less
[01:17:01.400 --> 01:17:05.680]  taxes and less government even if their deserts they become more productive than
[01:17:05.680 --> 01:17:12.160]  you know even very you know lush areas or look at Texas a magnet because of
[01:17:12.160 --> 01:17:16.400]  lower taxes even though they're actually quite high just compared to the rest of
[01:17:16.400 --> 01:17:19.680]  the country they're quite low Texas is booming while the rest of the country
[01:17:19.680 --> 01:17:24.560]  collapses well that's right and there's a reason for not to kill with in many
[01:17:24.560 --> 01:17:30.320]  states because they did not have any caps on medical malpractice damages in
[01:17:30.320 --> 01:17:33.880]  personal injury cases I remember recently in West Virginia the doctors
[01:17:33.880 --> 01:17:37.880]  all said well we're not gonna we're not gonna perform any more surgery unless
[01:17:37.880 --> 01:17:42.200]  you put a cap we're all going to Louisiana and with that threat the
[01:17:42.200 --> 01:17:46.480]  West Virginia then came up with a cap so that's that's a way in which the
[01:17:46.480 --> 01:17:52.240]  outlet of choosing a different state can check government overreach and then the
[01:17:52.240 --> 01:17:57.640]  second reason is simply because you we understand that government is largely
[01:17:57.640 --> 01:18:01.840]  you know trading off and balancing no interest with competing groups and
[01:18:01.840 --> 01:18:06.680]  society and so the states are able in some sense because they may be more
[01:18:06.680 --> 01:18:13.160]  homogeneous to adapt statutes and laws and policies that are more consistent
[01:18:13.160 --> 01:18:18.520]  with the greatest number of citizens than you know a larger context where when
[01:18:18.520 --> 01:18:22.960]  Congress and acts the law it's got to have application in very rural areas you
[01:18:22.960 --> 01:18:27.480]  know like North Dakota or sparsely populated like Alaska as well as
[01:18:27.480 --> 01:18:32.120]  California and New York and it's much more difficult to draft a statute that
[01:18:32.120 --> 01:18:37.960]  suits no 50 states then suits only one and so on that score as well federalism
[01:18:37.960 --> 01:18:41.920]  is is superior to a central government it doesn't mean that you don't need a
[01:18:41.920 --> 01:18:46.080]  central government in order to have armed forces you know to defend ourselves
[01:18:46.080 --> 01:18:51.240]  and there's some things that a central government is required to do and that's
[01:18:51.240 --> 01:18:55.320]  that a simple state could not and there's always a risk of course that one
[01:18:55.320 --> 01:19:01.760]  state could become oppressive and you would need some outside force in order
[01:19:01.760 --> 01:19:06.960]  to encourage and provide the spark to change things and I think we saw that in
[01:19:06.960 --> 01:19:11.880]  the South during Jim Crow there's no doubt that there was outside pressure
[01:19:11.880 --> 01:19:17.760]  that was needed to to ultimately prevent the oppression based upon race but
[01:19:17.760 --> 01:19:21.600]  that's got to be done judiciously though it's a balance like everything is that
[01:19:21.600 --> 01:19:26.640]  sure the two are checks in balance and you're gonna be with us till about 40
[01:19:26.640 --> 01:19:30.200]  after and I appreciate you having time to join us today we're gonna go to break
[01:19:30.200 --> 01:19:34.360]  and I want to come back understand your top constitutional lawyer here in
[01:19:34.360 --> 01:19:39.800]  layman's terms I'm simply saying if the states created the federal government we

[01:19:46.520 --> 01:19:50.480]  the real federalist system instead of right now we just have a federal
[01:19:50.480 --> 01:19:53.960]  government run by special interest running over us that's an obvious

[01:24:17.200 --> 01:24:21.880]  Paul Joseph Watson's joining us to break down the National Opt Out Day which is
[01:24:21.880 --> 01:24:26.240]  another example or opt out week where people just exercise their power you
[01:24:26.240 --> 01:24:30.160]  could have the states prosecute TSA when they're out of control they're already
[01:24:30.160 --> 01:24:33.160]  out of their jurisdiction they're not even sworn officers Bruce fine
[01:24:33.160 --> 01:24:37.040]  constitutional lawyer advisor to Congress advisor to Ron Paul's chief
[01:24:37.040 --> 01:24:41.240]  advisor on policy joins us in layman's terms sir in this short segment I
[01:24:41.240 --> 01:24:46.160]  understand you're saying that my basic you know statement is codified and
[01:24:46.160 --> 01:24:50.560]  things that have been done before put that in layman's terms for people and
[01:24:50.560 --> 01:24:55.840]  talk about states rights you know versus what the federal government's doing and
[01:24:55.840 --> 01:24:59.440]  your point during the break you made that states can also become
[01:24:59.440 --> 01:25:04.600]  charities of their own so how do you balance that well we balance that by
[01:25:04.600 --> 01:25:08.200]  having an active citizenry and impeaching and removing from office
[01:25:08.200 --> 01:25:13.240]  government officials are not faithful to their oath that generally keep
[01:25:13.240 --> 01:25:17.480]  government limited and austere and approval and to make certain that
[01:25:17.480 --> 01:25:21.640]  liberty is the rule and government involvement the exception as that you
[01:25:21.640 --> 01:25:26.040]  can have states out of control at the time of the founding it was Rhode Island
[01:25:26.040 --> 01:25:30.400]  with the outlier there was enacting all sorts of laws to cancel that stuff and
[01:25:30.400 --> 01:25:36.120]  was due to with great suspicion by the founding fathers so it's not a we don't
[01:25:36.120 --> 01:25:41.080]  automatically get over the touchdown line despite delegating powers or
[01:25:41.080 --> 01:25:46.040]  restoring powers to the state it without an active citizenry any kind of
[01:25:46.040 --> 01:25:50.440]  government ultimately will work but obviously things have all swung towards
[01:25:50.440 --> 01:25:54.760]  the federal government itself globalist so so what what do you think is a good
[01:25:54.760 --> 01:26:00.600]  plan to try to get the states as a focal point to reignite liberty well the
[01:26:00.600 --> 01:26:05.160]  essay the way in which you can do it with regard to the current situation is
[01:26:05.160 --> 01:26:08.920]  just have two-thirds of the state legislature's petition for the holding
[01:26:08.920 --> 01:26:13.560]  of a constitutional convention and that could be a convention that basically is
[01:26:13.560 --> 01:26:18.000]  a successor to the convention of 1787 in Philadelphia that wrote our
[01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:24.680]  constitution and the delegates could start from ground up and recast the
[01:26:24.680 --> 01:26:28.680]  disbursement of power between the federal government and the state but the
[01:26:28.680 --> 01:26:33.120]  one thing Alex said has been that I think destroyed the federalism that was
[01:26:33.120 --> 01:26:36.880]  conceived by the founding fathers with the income tax amendment because when the
[01:26:36.880 --> 01:26:40.520]  federal government got all the money they just told the state say if you want
[01:26:40.520 --> 01:26:44.360]  the money you have to do what we tell you and they also got the senators that's
[01:26:44.360 --> 01:26:50.680]  you know a very homogenous country with very little of any state ability to
[01:26:50.680 --> 01:26:54.920]  resist the federal government because the temptation the money was too great if
[01:26:54.920 --> 01:26:59.040]  you take that money away from the federal government you know in to reduce
[01:26:59.040 --> 01:27:04.760]  the tax and power and the spending ability don't worry the state's rights
[01:27:04.760 --> 01:27:08.560]  would revise very quickly and if you look at the special interests you know why
[01:27:08.560 --> 01:27:12.160]  are they all run and try to control Washington as opposed to the states
[01:27:12.160 --> 01:27:15.400]  relatively speaking because that's where the money is you know that's where the
[01:27:15.400 --> 01:27:18.560]  give-out and give-away they're staggering I mean look at the tarp money
[01:27:18.560 --> 01:27:23.560]  those tens hundreds of billions of dollars even trillions of dollars and
[01:27:23.560 --> 01:27:27.800]  once you stop that speak it go into the federal government I don't worry that
[01:27:27.800 --> 01:27:32.440]  the special interest will drop away very quickly and that's I agree so here
[01:27:32.440 --> 01:27:37.200]  here's why I'm taking this dramatic an idea that you have suggested could
[01:27:37.200 --> 01:27:42.520]  accomplish much but again I don't have any reluctance to using a new
[01:27:42.520 --> 01:27:47.600]  constitution if you will to re-examine of where our constitution has evolved to
[01:27:47.600 --> 01:27:53.480]  and how we need to revive a more dispersed and better with the system
[01:27:53.480 --> 01:27:57.520]  where much more decision-making to that the state and local level. Sure let me
[01:27:57.520 --> 01:28:00.720]  ask you this question currently when we know we're headed towards rack and
[01:28:00.720 --> 01:28:07.760]  ruin and they're trying to get a new VAT and a new carbon tax which if we think
[01:28:07.760 --> 01:28:12.040]  the income tax is bad wow get ready now we're going the same way Europe's going
[01:28:12.040 --> 01:28:16.640]  I mean how bad a situation do you think we're in Ron Paul said we're under the
[01:28:16.640 --> 01:28:20.080]  control of authoritarian psychopaths that have already gone off the cliff I
[01:28:20.080 --> 01:28:24.240]  agree so what do we do that's why I'm saying people are going to move towards
[01:28:24.240 --> 01:28:28.640]  the session the media is going to demonize it why not brand secession as
[01:28:28.640 --> 01:28:36.000]  really a reconstitution well I think the only reason is that the section isn't
[01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:41.880]  the only method of of protest here they say why not just call a convention and
[01:28:41.880 --> 01:28:45.440]  rewrite the rules of the games and the back to the state legislators which
[01:28:45.440 --> 01:28:49.560]  aren't controlled by Congress and and then have have a new playbook from the
[01:28:49.560 --> 01:28:53.560]  current Constitution which has been deformed and mutilated and and vivid
[01:28:53.560 --> 01:28:57.680]  sector by those in Congress and the executive branch there you would already
[01:28:57.680 --> 01:29:02.160]  have it's a you know a method for doing exactly what you've suggested and it's
[01:29:02.160 --> 01:29:06.400]  in the hands of the state because it's the state legislators who provoke the
[01:29:06.400 --> 01:29:10.760]  constitutional convention and then the state legislators ratified any amendments
[01:29:10.760 --> 01:29:14.800]  that are proposed and that's a way in which you could focus all the
[01:29:14.800 --> 01:29:20.600]  sentiments that are driving the secessionist idea into a clearly
[01:29:20.600 --> 01:29:25.280]  constitutionally recognized past that could revamp the government every
[01:29:25.280 --> 01:29:29.600]  dramatic very bit as dramatically as the Constitution revamped the articles of
[01:29:29.600 --> 01:29:33.800]  consideration but now when you say you know where are we going I agree that
[01:29:33.800 --> 01:29:37.400]  this is this country is totally a completely bankrupt already
[01:29:37.400 --> 01:29:41.240]  we'll stay there point four trillion national debt we're running trillion

[01:33:36.640 --> 01:33:41.280]  call us slaves to the New World Order slaves to world government I've played
[01:33:41.280 --> 01:33:45.760]  that clip probably a hundred times it's all linked in an article that we've put
[01:33:45.760 --> 01:33:50.320]  together and I'm glad that Ron Paul is coming out saying we're going under
[01:33:50.320 --> 01:33:54.760]  global government they're saying NATO and the UN runs our military Congress is
[01:33:54.760 --> 01:33:58.280]  being told that Obama has served as the head of the United Nations Security
[01:33:58.280 --> 01:34:03.080]  Council violating article one section nine this is all being done by these
[01:34:03.080 --> 01:34:06.720]  lawyers who know exactly what they're doing setting these precedents and just
[01:34:06.720 --> 01:34:11.840]  normalizing tyranny and Bruce Fine has written a new book that is a best-seller
[01:34:11.840 --> 01:34:17.920]  and it's Empire before the fall and then we need to make that book number one
[01:34:17.920 --> 01:34:21.440]  out there it's available all over the place but American Empire before the

[01:34:28.160 --> 01:34:31.480]  know this is all going on but what about your friends and family they don't
[01:34:31.480 --> 01:34:35.040]  know that's why you should give a gift subscription to Info Wars magazine 12
[01:34:35.040 --> 01:34:37.960]  issues to their door that's a good chance they're gonna look at that they're
[01:34:37.960 --> 01:34:41.800]  gonna read that they're gonna wake up people are ready to wake up now but
[01:34:41.800 --> 01:34:46.320]  there is a general laziness and immorality even if people work hard many
[01:34:46.320 --> 01:34:49.800]  of them are like hey politics is something somebody else does I don't need
[01:34:49.800 --> 01:34:53.960]  to be informed I don't need to know what's going on I don't need to say no
[01:34:53.960 --> 01:34:59.400]  the great news is they've got a poll out Huffington Post is running it we're 56
[01:34:59.400 --> 01:35:03.760]  percent of people plan to opt out and film the TSA good just just get
[01:35:03.760 --> 01:35:08.120]  something going and I've said the states created the federal government it's
[01:35:08.120 --> 01:35:12.920]  their job to say no and constitutional lawyer and scholar has concurred that
[01:35:12.920 --> 01:35:16.760]  what I've stated in my little primitive way from reading the history books it
[01:35:16.760 --> 01:35:22.400]  does have real avenues and is a good way to go but we need to attack on all
[01:35:22.400 --> 01:35:26.720]  fronts ladies and gentlemen Bruce Fine is our guest so you started getting into
[01:35:26.720 --> 01:35:31.520]  where we're going if we don't turn this around I mean I have a Forbes article
[01:35:31.520 --> 01:35:36.800]  and I went and looked it up and it's true that it's also in the San Diego paper
[01:35:36.800 --> 01:35:40.280]  Harold Tribune they're saying no we're gonna be a hundred thousand dollar fine
[01:35:40.280 --> 01:35:44.560]  if your dog leaves poop in the backyard we're gonna put you in jail for six
[01:35:44.560 --> 01:35:50.320]  years they're teaching kids this some families we had on this is gonna be a
[01:35:50.320 --> 01:35:54.720]  big story when it breaks north side independent school San Antonio Bruce
[01:35:54.720 --> 01:35:58.720]  they have now expelled the little girl we've had the Hernandez family in here
[01:35:58.720 --> 01:36:03.040]  because she won't wear the RFID tracker bracelet around her neck run by the
[01:36:03.040 --> 01:36:08.040]  Department of Defense that tracks her on the school bus and when she goes home
[01:36:08.040 --> 01:36:11.800]  government laptops are watching kids at home and you saw Ron Paul speech or I'm
[01:36:11.800 --> 01:36:16.920]  guessing you did I mean you watch that that's only part of how bad it is we're
[01:36:16.920 --> 01:36:20.880]  under psychopathic authoritarians or authoritarian psychopaths to quote Ron
[01:36:20.880 --> 01:36:25.160]  Paul and and I was talking in the break you said yeah in a few decades the
[01:36:25.160 --> 01:36:29.400]  Empire will fall I get that the Empire will hold together a while but it's
[01:36:29.400 --> 01:36:34.640]  going to absorb us to to fund itself I mean we're in deep trouble we're in
[01:36:34.640 --> 01:36:39.200]  1935 Germany and I have to debate my wife every day about getting out of the
[01:36:39.200 --> 01:36:42.040]  country and you know telling her we're gonna stay and go down with the ship I
[01:36:42.040 --> 01:36:46.200]  want to checkmate these people I want to get aggressive I want to turn this
[01:36:46.200 --> 01:36:49.360]  around I know I'm ranting Bruce you've got the floor I mean where is this going
[01:36:49.360 --> 01:36:53.280]  what are some of your other ideas to kickstart the state saying no I mean what
[01:36:53.280 --> 01:36:57.680]  can we do what do we do if last year the house unanimously voted to arrest ESA
[01:36:57.680 --> 01:37:01.560]  when they break state laws and grab genitals and the fed said we'll put F
[01:37:01.560 --> 01:37:05.600]  16s in the air and bring down aircraft that was in the news a blockade like
[01:37:05.600 --> 01:37:11.520]  Fort Sumter and the Senate killed it literally grobbling in fear I mean this
[01:37:11.520 --> 01:37:15.880]  is pathetic the feds want this challenge because they're not the feds
[01:37:15.880 --> 01:37:20.280]  they're an alien criminal group in sedition against my country I want my
[01:37:20.280 --> 01:37:24.480]  republic back Bruce I'm ranting what do you say to this well first of all you're
[01:37:24.480 --> 01:37:29.440]  quite correct if the common citizen doesn't discharge his or her duty to
[01:37:29.440 --> 01:37:34.200]  make certain that the Constitution is a complied with by the elected officials
[01:37:34.200 --> 01:37:38.880]  then ultimately everything will crumble because we know elected officials those
[01:37:38.880 --> 01:37:42.880]  in government have an incentive to a grand eyes power because that makes them
[01:37:42.880 --> 01:37:50.080]  feel powerful it makes them feel their celebrities it makes them feel that they
[01:37:50.080 --> 01:37:54.360]  are superior and so if the common citizen is not going to be politically
[01:37:54.360 --> 01:38:00.080]  active it's over I can tell you that it is over if you a people of sheep will
[01:38:00.080 --> 01:38:03.720]  get a government of wolves I want to repeat that that people of sheep will
[01:38:03.720 --> 01:38:07.800]  get a government of wolves it happens every time so what does that mean it
[01:38:07.800 --> 01:38:13.520]  means that we've got to restore as a principle of government that liberty is
[01:38:13.520 --> 01:38:17.760]  the rule it is the rule that the individual is the center of our
[01:38:17.760 --> 01:38:22.120]  constitutional universe not government and that there must be a great and urgent
[01:38:22.120 --> 01:38:27.200]  cause before government tells you what to do I keep that the liberty is the
[01:38:27.200 --> 01:38:31.000]  default position unless the government has a really good reason that it can
[01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:35.360]  support by empirical evidence or experience they need to let you alone
[01:38:35.360 --> 01:38:39.920]  the right to be left alone is the most cherished right among civilized people
[01:38:39.920 --> 01:38:44.600]  and that has to be the working principle of our government and it's been lost
[01:38:44.600 --> 01:38:48.200]  over the hundreds of years and you decided to recite the litany of
[01:38:48.200 --> 01:38:53.000]  intrusion you know that maybe you forgot how about surveillance drones and how
[01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:56.920]  about putting things in your computer so your picture is displayed with the
[01:38:56.920 --> 01:39:02.200]  government every time you get on and then visit the internet or internet
[01:39:02.200 --> 01:39:06.320]  Explorer the other thing is the money issue that you pointed out you simply
[01:39:06.320 --> 01:39:12.400]  cannot have a system that has 16.4 trillion in national debt which is
[01:39:12.400 --> 01:39:16.800]  about 50,000 for every man woman and child in the country and running
[01:39:16.800 --> 01:39:21.600]  trillion dollar deficit year after year and to sustain itself just like no
[01:39:21.600 --> 01:39:26.000]  family could avoid bankruptcy if you know if they're spending a million
[01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:30.160]  dollars a year you know with income like a hundred thousand dollars it is not
[01:39:30.160 --> 01:39:34.240]  sustainable and then we need an amendment to the Constitution says the
[01:39:34.240 --> 01:39:38.720]  federal government cannot borrow money except in times of war something
[01:39:38.720 --> 01:39:43.640]  Thomas Jefferson proposed over two centuries ago but Alex the only way
[01:39:43.640 --> 01:39:47.200]  you can insist on government is for Galadies prevent them from borrowing
[01:39:47.200 --> 01:39:52.360]  because their incentive is to saddle prosperity with all the payback of what
[01:39:52.360 --> 01:39:56.680]  they want to spend now so that's why the borrowing is a is up to 16 trillion
[01:39:56.680 --> 01:40:02.360]  that would be 17 or 18 trillion probably by New Year's and these things must be
[01:40:02.360 --> 01:40:06.160]  insisted upon by an active individual exactly notice how it's
[01:40:06.160 --> 01:40:13.040]  accelerating I'm sorry I'm just saying it's exactly it's all accelerating how
[01:40:13.040 --> 01:40:16.680]  do I mean what are some of your ideas to put the brakes on it what do you think
[01:40:16.680 --> 01:40:21.080]  Ron Paul should be doing right now is his one of his chief advisors well I
[01:40:21.080 --> 01:40:25.600]  think that you're using the campaign for liberty and really just creating you
[01:40:25.600 --> 01:40:31.160]  know an educated public that will use their their ballots to vote out of
[01:40:31.160 --> 01:40:36.320]  office those members who continue to vote to increase the federal budget to
[01:40:36.320 --> 01:40:42.600]  increase the spending the global military in meddling in every single
[01:40:42.600 --> 01:40:47.240]  corner of the earth for people whom we have no moral or legal obligation to
[01:40:47.240 --> 01:40:51.680]  defend at a staggering cost of over a trillion dollars a year and when they're
[01:40:51.680 --> 01:40:55.520]  ousted from office that will send the message that the members will pay
[01:40:55.520 --> 01:41:00.320]  attention yes sir and it's got to be a group that stands together as tightly as
[01:41:00.320 --> 01:41:05.180]  the National Rifle Association if you don't vote to cut the spending and to
[01:41:05.180 --> 01:41:11.080]  cut the taxes and to end the permanent warfare you're out of it and that will
[01:41:11.080 --> 01:41:15.000]  date that that is what they were members will pay attention to and in
[01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:21.560]  anything else is simply nothing but hot air and the voters have got to be so
[01:41:21.560 --> 01:41:25.760]  consistent that they've got to be very very alert to what their members doing
[01:41:25.760 --> 01:41:29.160]  so that they can't escape the accountability that the Constitution
[01:41:29.160 --> 01:41:33.080]  intended and Bruce fine you just said it right there I've I've pulled it down to
[01:41:33.080 --> 01:41:39.080]  my own you know be a simple statement but the guns are the way to victory the
[01:41:39.080 --> 01:41:44.880]  second amendment is the key not using the guns but the example of how government
[01:41:44.880 --> 01:41:50.680]  on this one issue has been reversed there's been a few others in the recent
[01:41:50.680 --> 01:41:55.560]  past just politically people exposing abortion there's less of it it's
[01:41:55.560 --> 01:42:00.440]  becoming more unpopular because of education because the authoritarian
[01:42:00.440 --> 01:42:05.120]  systems have big trouble when the population becomes informed as Thomas
[01:42:05.120 --> 01:42:09.360]  Jefferson said educate the public and basic liberty and freedom and tyranny
[01:42:09.360 --> 01:42:14.000]  will vanish like phantoms at dawn to paraphrase him but with the guns we are
[01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:18.080]  beating with the state county federal level liberals are becoming
[01:42:18.080 --> 01:42:22.880]  undomesticated at record numbers buying guns it's a culture thing and we have to
[01:42:22.880 --> 01:42:28.880]  create and push that culture of liberty and independence the problem is we're
[01:42:28.880 --> 01:42:32.960]  winning on the guns we're losing when it comes to other dependency what do you
[01:42:32.960 --> 01:42:37.880]  do is the illegals become citizens or vote fraudulently or as disenfranchised
[01:42:37.880 --> 01:42:44.160]  people go on welfare multi-generationally we're passing that Rubicon now where
[01:42:44.160 --> 01:42:48.200]  there are going to be more dependence than producers and we're in the pure
[01:42:48.200 --> 01:42:55.160]  democracy they can vote that the other 49% be their slaves we've now passed that
[01:42:55.160 --> 01:43:00.760]  point to a great extent where the California's in New York's can band
[01:43:00.760 --> 01:43:05.600]  together and make us their slaves and boy and and and put shackles on us so what
[01:43:05.600 --> 01:43:11.560]  do we do well the disadvantage of that position Alex and even the people who
[01:43:11.560 --> 01:43:17.760]  are dependent they know and they feel that they are even if they don't express
[01:43:17.760 --> 01:43:22.240]  it they're undeserving and that's what we need to do and this is true of every
[01:43:22.240 --> 01:43:26.440]  human being even if they're temporarily dependent there is a thrill there is a
[01:43:26.440 --> 01:43:31.280]  dignity that comes from hard work and from burning your own keep and that's
[01:43:31.280 --> 01:43:35.320]  true of everybody even those who are dependent if you have an opportunity say
[01:43:35.320 --> 01:43:39.600]  no we know that you have the talent and ability to work here's the opportunity
[01:43:39.600 --> 01:43:45.280]  learn use your your your your talents and genius and ambition to move forward they
[01:43:45.280 --> 01:43:50.320]  would prefer that they're too dependent to be they get caught in some way by a
[01:43:50.320 --> 01:43:56.480]  very your feet up for liberal culture to think oh well you're dependent because
[01:43:56.480 --> 01:44:00.880]  the system's so unfair and you were born in the situation and your genes don't
[01:44:00.880 --> 01:44:05.160]  enable you to do things something that's very demeaning and that's why we should
[01:44:05.160 --> 01:44:08.720]  never lose hope even with those vast numbers that you point out that are
[01:44:08.720 --> 01:44:13.160]  dependent because ultimately everyone really is more proud they're more
[01:44:13.160 --> 01:44:17.840]  fulfilled they have greater self-esteem if they're making it on their own and
[01:44:17.840 --> 01:44:22.160]  that will always be the case so long use the heartbeat and in the head to
[01:44:22.160 --> 01:44:28.200]  celebrate Wow you just told a big truth there because I've seen I've been in the
[01:44:28.200 --> 01:44:32.480]  committee hearings I have video of it in my film in-game where the Democrats
[01:44:32.480 --> 01:44:37.600]  actually got up and said we've got to put all these minority kids on
[01:44:37.600 --> 01:44:40.960]  psychotropic drugs and we've got to take them from their parents because they
[01:44:40.960 --> 01:44:45.840]  come from bad gene pools we have that that's actually a quote and when you
[01:44:45.840 --> 01:44:49.280]  really study liberals these people are not liberals they all come out of the
[01:44:49.280 --> 01:44:54.400]  Margaret Sanger Rockefeller eugenics system and Bruce I think you just showed
[01:44:54.400 --> 01:44:57.920]  again your incredible knowledge you know comment on that in closing and the
[01:44:57.920 --> 01:45:02.480]  weather point we've seen the FCC thanks to you and others leading it moving away
[01:45:02.480 --> 01:45:06.440]  from censorship away you're getting rid of the fairness doctrine when you were
[01:45:06.440 --> 01:45:12.520]  there so so it's not impossible to to go in the other direction if we just know
[01:45:12.520 --> 01:45:16.760]  what the other direction is well that's right and the other right now I'd say
[01:45:16.760 --> 01:45:21.520]  that the so-called progressive or liberals you know it's intellectual
[01:45:21.520 --> 01:45:25.840]  vacuousness and that's why we shouldn't be disheartened because we actually have
[01:45:25.840 --> 01:45:30.760]  substance that corresponds to real human nature not artificial human nature and
[01:45:30.760 --> 01:45:35.240]  also Alex there are their trajectories their rises and falls and cycles you know
[01:45:35.240 --> 01:45:40.880]  in the in any nation and we should never think that things are static that they
[01:45:40.880 --> 01:45:46.640]  they can't change otherwise we give up hope and to some degree we have to be
[01:45:46.640 --> 01:45:51.640]  patient that changes don't occur overnight especially with regard to culture
[01:45:51.640 --> 01:45:55.560]  but we have to have the strength and the commitment that even if it doesn't
[01:45:55.560 --> 01:46:00.440]  happen to our lifetimes we set the seeds we plant the seeds in the foundation for
[01:46:00.440 --> 01:46:04.440]  those who stand on our shoulders maybe that the class that's right in the
[01:46:04.440 --> 01:46:09.680]  victory and that's as long as we are intellectually and morally solid
[01:46:09.680 --> 01:46:14.040]  ultimately we will prevail because human nature can't be changed and brain
[01:46:14.040 --> 01:46:18.600]  watched even if the liberals think it can't well sure look at Ron Paul 16
[01:46:18.600 --> 01:46:24.240]  years ago no co-sponsors now passes in the Fed after he's gone those ideas are
[01:46:24.240 --> 01:46:28.960]  still there I look at my show 17 years ago access television today 3 million
[01:46:28.960 --> 01:46:34.280]  people a day conservatively and and and yes we're gaining momentum and I want
[01:46:34.280 --> 01:46:37.520]  people to have hope but here's the problem the social engineers I've read
[01:46:37.520 --> 01:46:41.400]  countless books they've written they know we're back lashing they're using
[01:46:41.400 --> 01:46:47.320]  our money to war game and do nothing but try to stop us from the natural flows
[01:46:47.320 --> 01:46:51.920]  switching back to reality and and and you know they call it the final revolution
[01:46:51.920 --> 01:46:56.840]  as you know now they call it you know the their collectivist utopia system and
[01:46:56.840 --> 01:47:02.280]  I just want folks to know we're in for a very dangerous ride well it is and
[01:47:02.280 --> 01:47:06.960]  nothing accomplished without without some difficulty Alex if it wasn't
[01:47:06.960 --> 01:47:11.320]  difficult it had been done 10 years ago so what you pointed out is certainly
[01:47:11.320 --> 01:47:16.320]  accurate and we can expect that the opponents will throw money and and
[01:47:16.320 --> 01:47:20.560]  propaganda and everything else because they know we are attacking you know
[01:47:20.560 --> 01:47:25.600]  their their power center which is this myth of liberalism and you know
[01:47:25.600 --> 01:47:29.320]  everyone's a product of their environment and you just throw money at
[01:47:29.320 --> 01:47:32.920]  everybody and and you know it and nobody really made their own deal you know
[01:47:32.920 --> 01:47:39.040]  no one has succeeded on their own and that's why they're so fearful and we
[01:47:39.040 --> 01:47:43.240]  see it well regularly in the US Supreme Court you know with regard to the
[01:47:43.240 --> 01:47:46.840]  hearings on affirmative action the special preferences are given based
[01:47:46.840 --> 01:47:52.200]  upon the race they're frightened of that because they underscore how much no
[01:47:52.200 --> 01:47:57.560]  liberty and individual liberty is going to defeat their big government kind of
[01:47:57.560 --> 01:48:02.280]  eugenics program in an odd way absolutely that's incredible when these
[01:48:02.280 --> 01:48:06.880]  liberals say blacks and Hispanics come from bad gene pools that's why we have
[01:48:06.880 --> 01:48:10.880]  to have to take their kids and have to dumb them down I mean it's just totally
[01:48:10.880 --> 01:48:16.040]  evil and and totally dismissive and disgusting Bruce fine thank you for the
[01:48:16.040 --> 01:48:20.040]  time sir thank you thanks Alex thank you there goes Bruce fine amazing
[01:48:20.040 --> 01:48:24.880]  individual yeah it's you got to watch that in-game and there's a bunch of
[01:48:24.880 --> 01:48:28.160]  clips where they they go they come from bad gene pools that's that's why we
[01:48:28.160 --> 01:48:31.240]  that's why we take them from their parents and put them on drugs shifting
[01:48:31.240 --> 01:48:36.240]  gears now Paul Watson joins us via video Skype he's on with us for this segment
[01:48:36.240 --> 01:48:39.880]  the next and then the one after that and then Dr. Wallach's gonna be in here in
[01:48:39.880 --> 01:48:45.080]  studio but Watson wow I want to say great job to you and that particular
[01:48:45.080 --> 01:48:48.400]  activist you interviewed remind me of her name that said hey we did opt out
[01:48:48.400 --> 01:48:52.360]  three years ago now let's film the TSA you pushed me to get this out our
[01:48:52.360 --> 01:48:57.120]  listeners picked up on it it's really gaining steam so Paul Watson give us an
[01:48:57.120 --> 01:49:01.520]  update on what's happening with opt out we can film now the TSA before they
[01:49:01.520 --> 01:49:05.320]  expand their operations everywhere which they're now trying to do tell us what's
[01:49:05.320 --> 01:49:09.880]  happening Paul Watson well yeah it's basically being getting quite a bit of
[01:49:09.880 --> 01:49:14.800]  press attention over the last few days including CBS news where one individual
[01:49:14.800 --> 01:49:19.600]  named Christopher Key spoke about his plans to opt out and I'm actually in
[01:49:19.600 --> 01:49:23.840]  contact with him as well so I think he's got video from the airport he went
[01:49:23.840 --> 01:49:29.280]  through as you mentioned Ashley Jessica who's helping us organize it is there in
[01:49:29.280 --> 01:49:34.240]  Buffalo I believe it is with Dan Dix of press for truth there are we are change
[01:49:34.240 --> 01:49:38.320]  groups involved in it and several other groups so I'm looking forward over the
[01:49:38.320 --> 01:49:41.960]  next few days to get some video which will feature on the website and it's
[01:49:41.960 --> 01:49:49.440]  info wars.com slash opt out for all the information Paul continue with the news
[01:49:49.440 --> 01:49:53.600]  you've got coming in I noticed the Huffington Post says 56% planned to
[01:49:53.600 --> 01:50:00.360]  opt out and film the the hamburglers well yeah that was a poll conducted by
[01:50:00.360 --> 01:50:04.360]  Christopher Elliott who is a consumer advocate he's on board with the campaign
[01:50:04.360 --> 01:50:08.360]  as well he's been promoting it and basically the the latest news about the
[01:50:08.360 --> 01:50:14.160]  TSA is Bloomberg Business Week did an investigation and it turns out TSA
[01:50:14.160 --> 01:50:19.480]  security procedures are actually killing Americans in far greater numbers than
[01:50:19.480 --> 01:50:23.880]  terrorists could ever dream of because they did a study they found out that the
[01:50:23.880 --> 01:50:29.120]  number of Americans who are now using the highway as a result of refusing to
[01:50:29.120 --> 01:50:33.680]  fly specifically because of these invasive procedures are dying in car
[01:50:33.680 --> 01:50:41.120]  accidents obviously at a rate of 242 fatalities per month so literally every
[01:50:41.120 --> 01:50:45.560]  four or five months we've got or six months we got deaths on the scale

[01:55:31.080 --> 01:55:34.120]  nicely all right I'm gonna stop I could play a fat guy nicely I'm sorry you're
[01:55:34.120 --> 01:55:37.560]  awesome I'm joking I've lost a lot of weight Watson you can say at least I'm
[01:55:37.560 --> 01:55:41.000]  like Mr. Potato Head Jones seriously getting back to what I was saying and
[01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:46.880]  your wife's also a wonderful person expanding on this national opt out day
[01:55:46.880 --> 01:55:50.880]  let's get into the serious facets of this because it is exciting that this is
[01:55:50.880 --> 01:55:54.120]  catching on Paul and you were talking about TSA security procedures are
[01:55:54.120 --> 01:55:58.040]  killing Americans Bloomberg is reporting what we've already noticed and
[01:55:58.040 --> 01:56:02.680]  travel groups on singing in admit 40 billion a year or more is lost people
[01:56:02.680 --> 01:56:07.080]  just won't let a weird perv stick their hands down their pants but hey the TSA
[01:56:07.080 --> 01:56:11.000]  says they're coming to your street so it doesn't matter well that's the thing and
[01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:16.040]  this is Cornell University that's done this study 242 driving fatalities per
[01:56:16.040 --> 01:56:20.440]  month because people are refusing to fly because of the TSA's policies but the
[01:56:20.440 --> 01:56:24.360]  thing that annoys me Alex every time I post something about this opt out
[01:56:24.360 --> 01:56:29.520]  campaign is people respond a significant minority of people respond by saying
[01:56:29.520 --> 01:56:34.320]  let's just boycott the airlines which is all very good because it requires them
[01:56:34.320 --> 01:56:38.880]  to do little other than sit on their backsides and do nothing but the point
[01:56:38.880 --> 01:56:44.680]  is that wouldn't work most of the polls and our own poll say that most Americans
[01:56:44.680 --> 01:56:48.560]  actually like the TSA it's only a minority that are up in arms about them
[01:56:48.560 --> 01:56:53.280]  as is the case with any civil rights issue so that's not gonna have an impact
[01:56:53.280 --> 01:56:58.720]  what is gonna have an impact because it's already proven so is slowing down the
[01:56:58.720 --> 01:57:02.120]  security lines at airports by opting out the body scan and all the other
[01:57:02.120 --> 01:57:06.800]  ridiculous procedures because that's the very reason why the TSA was forced to
[01:57:06.800 --> 01:57:12.680]  mothball and put into storage 91 x-ray radiation scan as they took him out the
[01:57:12.680 --> 01:57:17.240]  busiest airports in the country had to put them into storage because people
[01:57:17.240 --> 01:57:22.080]  rotting out of them they were taking too long to operate and that's a perfect
[01:57:22.080 --> 01:57:26.320]  illustration of how this kind of action can have a direct effect and then there's
[01:57:26.320 --> 01:57:30.800]  a fact that people say oh I'm just gonna take the highway well it's TSA on the
[01:57:30.800 --> 01:57:34.280]  highway you know I'm just gonna take the train there's TSA in the subway
[01:57:34.280 --> 01:57:38.560]  stations and the train stations you know mobility is an essential part of
[01:57:38.560 --> 01:57:42.560]  freedom you can't just keep giving up your rights and scaling your own behavior
[01:57:42.560 --> 01:57:45.920]  and activity back and back and back until you just say well I just won't leave my
[01:57:45.920 --> 01:57:49.560]  own house and then I'll be free and safe you know what's the point of having
[01:57:49.560 --> 01:57:54.720]  freedom inside a cage you've got to get out there and exercise the freedoms
[01:57:54.720 --> 01:57:57.920]  that's what they're all about if you don't exercise them out in the public
[01:57:57.920 --> 01:58:01.800]  arena they're completely worthless so you've got to get out of the coffin and
[01:58:01.800 --> 01:58:07.960]  out there exercising the freedoms count Watson tell us more I'm sorry I'm sorry

[02:00:37.560 --> 02:00:40.680]  basically running checkpoints and they're gonna have dr. walleck in studio
[02:00:40.680 --> 02:00:45.120]  this we may even go into overdrive for a full hour if he can do it coming up he's
[02:00:45.120 --> 02:00:49.680]  also gonna be on the nightly news and a lot more but paul watson I was joking
[02:00:49.680 --> 02:00:53.960]  around with a minute ago you know this is really really heavy subjects but it
[02:00:53.960 --> 02:00:58.200]  is exciting to see people getting involved in saying no what about the
[02:00:58.200 --> 02:01:01.920]  reports where the TSA is trying to cover up their badges are wearing their
[02:01:01.920 --> 02:01:06.440]  little they're not even sworn officer badges upside down what's your take on
[02:01:06.440 --> 02:01:12.880]  that Watson well that came out from a journalist the syndicated columnist
[02:01:12.880 --> 02:01:18.360]  who syndicated in over 100 newspapers Amy Alcon and she was basically groped
[02:01:18.360 --> 02:01:23.120]  on her private parts again she's repeatedly groped and she was just
[02:01:23.120 --> 02:01:27.840]  trying to find out the TSA agent's name her first name she knew her surname and
[02:01:27.840 --> 02:01:32.720]  the badge was upside down so it was illegible she then complained to the
[02:01:32.720 --> 02:01:37.040]  supervisor trying to get this agent's name who groped her and she threatened her
[02:01:37.040 --> 02:01:41.520]  with arrest the supervisor simply for asking for their identity which of
[02:01:41.520 --> 02:01:47.200]  course is completely illegal so there's basically an attempt to stop people
[02:01:47.200 --> 02:01:51.360]  complaining they want to get through their obedience training anyone who does
[02:01:51.360 --> 02:01:55.080]  complain it's subject to punishment there was a guy who got smacked in the
[02:01:55.080 --> 02:01:59.240]  testicles for complaining they've stolen money iPads off people for
[02:01:59.240 --> 02:02:04.840]  complaining and basically the TSA start out with 15,000 agents now it's got
[02:02:04.840 --> 02:02:10.880]  65,000 agents they're expanding outside the airport they're on the highways
[02:02:10.880 --> 02:02:15.360]  they're at political events music concerts even prom nights at school so
[02:02:15.360 --> 02:02:20.240]  it's just getting out of control and if we don't stand up to it now who knows
[02:02:20.240 --> 02:02:23.520]  where we're gonna be in five years time and say no let's boycott the airlines
[02:02:23.520 --> 02:02:26.920]  just not gonna work you know the tourism industry in America has already lost
[02:02:26.920 --> 02:02:30.760]  billions of dollars since 9-eleven because of these ridiculous security
[02:02:30.760 --> 02:02:34.320]  procedures and they don't care they're just gonna continue on with them until
[02:02:34.320 --> 02:02:38.400]  you actually make it difficult for them to carry out these grow downs and body
[02:02:38.400 --> 02:02:42.280]  scanners so that's what we've been doing we've had some level of success they've
[02:02:42.280 --> 02:02:45.720]  mothballed some of the scanners and now we're taking it to the next level with
[02:02:45.720 --> 02:02:50.760]  this opt out campaign and it's info wars.com slash opt out and you don't even
[02:02:50.760 --> 02:02:55.160]  have to be flying to take part in it you can hand out the flyers which you can
[02:02:55.160 --> 02:02:59.000]  print out from the website and you can hand them out to other travelers to make
[02:02:59.000 --> 02:03:03.320]  them aware of the body scanners because a lot of people don't even know in
[02:03:03.320 --> 02:03:07.440]  America you've got the right to opt out to them. Exactly we've got a resistance
[02:03:07.440 --> 02:03:12.520]  a key fight you mentioned Dan Dix great activist filmmaker he's on the way to a
[02:03:12.520 --> 02:03:16.160]  local airport in his area real fast we got about a minute and a half here Dan
[02:03:16.160 --> 02:03:21.520]  people can jump what airport are you going to? We're on our way to the Buffalo
[02:03:21.520 --> 02:03:25.520]  Airport right now we're just made a quick little pit stop off the side of the
[02:03:25.520 --> 02:03:28.840]  road here and should be there probably in the next half hour so I don't know if
[02:03:28.840 --> 02:03:33.400]  anybody's in the Buffalo area if you want to come down and help us we got a big
[02:03:33.400 --> 02:03:38.000]  stack of flyers we got a couple cameras and we're ready to do this and expose
[02:03:38.000 --> 02:03:42.360]  the tyranny of the TSA so we should be there in about a half hour at the Buffalo
[02:03:42.360 --> 02:03:46.640]  Airport anybody wants to come on down and meet up with us and take part in the
[02:03:46.640 --> 02:03:52.320]  campaign that would be great absolutely protesting the TSA that's really what

[02:09:25.760 --> 02:09:30.160]  owned David Ortiz went out on the streets and talked to Austinites about
[02:09:30.160 --> 02:09:32.360]  that that's coming up at the bottom of the hour it's about a four minute report
[02:09:32.360 --> 02:09:36.920]  also we're going to overdrive into the next hour with dr. Joel Wallach who's
[02:09:36.920 --> 02:09:42.080]  here in studio with us and we also are going to play a piece right now by our
[02:09:42.080 --> 02:09:47.000]  very own jacari Jackson he and Marcos Morales went out to f1 outside Austin
[02:09:47.000 --> 02:09:50.200]  where the Bilderberg group basically comes to town this is the King's Sport
[02:09:50.200 --> 02:09:54.840]  they're mainly hedge fund hyenas and derivative scammers most of them should
[02:09:54.840 --> 02:09:57.720]  be in jail like Bernie Madoff whose accountant blew his head off over the
[02:09:57.720 --> 02:10:02.800]  weekend sure he'll now tell no tales dead men tell no tales his son committed
[02:10:02.800 --> 02:10:05.920]  suicide too if you believe that you believe the Easter Bunny actually puts
[02:10:05.920 --> 02:10:09.440]  little eggs out on Easter every year for you and your children little little
[02:10:09.440 --> 02:10:12.800]  little chocolate candy eggs as well little chocolate bunnies are real maybe
[02:10:12.800 --> 02:10:16.800]  they come to life and hop around outside at night it's as real as the twilight TV
[02:10:16.800 --> 02:10:23.760]  show or movie that's coming out so so again ladies and gentlemen the the state
[02:10:23.760 --> 02:10:28.240]  guard but still a sign of the army under the governor out there with their US
[02:10:28.240 --> 02:10:31.960]  army outfits we're out there directing traffic checking in cars doing this and
[02:10:31.960 --> 02:10:36.000]  that and the state guards are great people okay the military is great people
[02:10:36.000 --> 02:10:39.960]  on average but why did governor Perry who was photographed you go to the F1 site
[02:10:39.960 --> 02:10:44.200]  and show this why did you know Rick Perry out there with all these globalists
[02:10:44.200 --> 02:10:48.360]  and Eccleston who gets all this taxpayer money in fact I am you guys an
[02:10:48.360 --> 02:10:53.840]  article and I don't see my IM stack today it's actually in the IM's we pull it
[02:10:53.840 --> 02:10:58.400]  the Bloomberg headline about hundreds of millions go to build F1 but teachers
[02:10:58.400 --> 02:11:03.160]  are fired that's why I'm so upset about this because taxpayers pay for this so
[02:11:03.160 --> 02:11:06.600]  this guy can give a three billion dollar gift to his daughter this year oh
[02:11:06.600 --> 02:11:10.320]  here's a three billion dollars I'm getting old I want to get out of you know
[02:11:10.320 --> 02:11:15.400]  taxes here's three billion baby if it was three billion from something he
[02:11:15.400 --> 02:11:19.600]  actually did that'd be great but no it's everyone financing his courses all
[02:11:19.600 --> 02:11:24.680]  over the world it's the yeah there's the governor with Eccleston very very
[02:11:24.680 --> 02:11:30.400]  disgusting from the official F1 site all basically taxpayer funded one way or
[02:11:30.400 --> 02:11:33.920]  another just disgusting Rick Perry make me want to throw up anyways that's
[02:11:33.920 --> 02:11:39.240]  enough of that let's go to the Shikari Jackson piece the audio for the radio
[02:11:39.240 --> 02:11:45.560]  listeners video for people watching at prisonplanted.tv and here it is
[02:11:53.000 --> 02:11:57.840]  we're out here at the Formula One race track right outside of Austin, Texas it
[02:11:57.840 --> 02:12:01.680]  is definitely loud we have helicopters flying overhead as you can hear I
[02:12:01.680 --> 02:12:05.440]  believe they're in the practice runs behind me you can also see behind me
[02:12:05.440 --> 02:12:08.680]  some military personnel and we're just curious as to why they're out here
[02:12:08.680 --> 02:12:11.280]  directing traffic so let's go see if we can get a word
[02:12:11.280 --> 02:12:14.960]  sir what are you doing out here today? We're out here just supporting the event the
[02:12:14.960 --> 02:12:18.240]  coordinators for the event asked if we would be out here be available to support
[02:12:18.240 --> 02:12:21.680]  in this with as far as traffic control things that nature we're just out here
[02:12:21.680 --> 02:12:25.360]  supporting the event. So we're just here to support the Travis County Police
[02:12:25.360 --> 02:12:29.720]  Department. We're out here in support of the local civilian authorities any large
[02:12:29.720 --> 02:12:34.040]  public event like this there's always a public safety concern and we're out here
[02:12:34.040 --> 02:12:37.920]  much like the local law enforcement is just to just make sure everybody has a
[02:12:37.920 --> 02:12:42.440]  good safe time and just to help out our our friends. You're there to acclimate
[02:12:42.440 --> 02:12:46.200]  people buddy. What branch of the military are you with sir? Texas Army National
[02:12:46.200 --> 02:12:50.400]  Guard. What are the Texas Army National Guard? And what branch of the military are
[02:12:50.400 --> 02:12:55.440]  you with? Army National Guard. Have you ever heard of Posse Comitatis? No sir. And have
[02:12:55.440 --> 02:13:00.320]  you ever heard of Posse Comitatis? I have. Okay. Briefly can you explain to us
[02:13:00.320 --> 02:13:05.240]  what that is sir? I'm afraid I'm not good enough with the law to be able to do
[02:13:05.240 --> 02:13:09.240]  that. All right. Are you doing anything besides directing traffic sir? No we're
[02:13:09.240 --> 02:13:13.960]  just assisting assisting under the civil authorities. Civil authorities you're
[02:13:13.960 --> 02:13:21.320]  referring to what? The immediately it's under the governor but it's we're
[02:13:21.320 --> 02:13:26.280]  assisting Travis County then the local law enforcement with them. Okay. All right
[02:13:26.280 --> 02:13:30.400]  thank you for your time sir. Now the race has officially begun we've had to move
[02:13:30.400 --> 02:13:34.360]  even farther out into the parking lot to avoid the noise. Now the soldiers we
[02:13:34.360 --> 02:13:37.800]  spoke with weren't too familiar with Posse Comitatis which separates police
[02:13:37.800 --> 02:13:41.600]  in military but the soldier did point out there is a chain of command but
[02:13:41.600 --> 02:13:44.800]  ultimately they're here under the direction of Governor Rick Perry. I'm
[02:13:44.800 --> 02:13:48.960]  Descartes Jackson for the Info Wars Nightly News.
[02:13:49.080 --> 02:13:55.200]  All right and again I happened to be driving outside Austin and went up on a
[02:13:55.200 --> 02:13:59.400]  mixed master this weekend on Saturday when they were doing qualifying runs and
[02:13:59.400 --> 02:14:03.400]  there were at least eight helicopters over the track and that's where the
[02:14:03.400 --> 02:14:07.360]  elitists go up and they watch the new Roman bleachers are the helicopters
[02:14:07.360 --> 02:14:11.800]  swimming around and they got temporary helipads all over Austin and in
[02:14:11.800 --> 02:14:16.520]  neighborhoods at night now learn till 4 a.m. they were landing you know with
[02:14:16.520 --> 02:14:23.600]  getting their women delivered everything else and just yeah with all this
[02:14:23.600 --> 02:14:27.840]  taxpayer money they've gotten and bailout money and and their giant yachts
[02:14:27.840 --> 02:14:31.840]  and then and literally guys getting out of limos like nine women behind them I
[02:14:31.840 --> 02:14:36.120]  mean it's ridiculous this is the new Empire's built on destroying our
[02:14:36.120 --> 02:14:40.320]  country and I got to pay for it and you got to pay for it if you live in Texas
[02:14:40.320 --> 02:14:44.600]  absolutely amazing how much taxpayer money went to this it's like building
[02:14:44.600 --> 02:14:49.040]  these billion dollar stadiums and you can go to the F1 website and see all the
[02:14:49.040 --> 02:14:55.360]  photos of it so shifting gears out of that now we are joined for the rest of
[02:14:55.360 --> 02:14:58.440]  this hour and some of the next hour he's here in town putting on an event
[02:14:58.440 --> 02:15:02.960]  tonight and tomorrow night and later we'll be able to give you the address of
[02:15:02.960 --> 02:15:07.920]  that on air and tell people about where that is going to be tonight here in
[02:15:07.920 --> 02:15:13.040]  Austin Texas Dr. Joel Wallach is no stranger to this show you've heard him
[02:15:13.040 --> 02:15:16.520]  on the radio you've seen him via Skype the first time I've met him in person
[02:15:16.520 --> 02:15:21.360]  but listening to his material for about 16 years and you saw well he saw iron
[02:15:21.360 --> 02:15:25.040]  dykes lose 98 pounds on stuff that's not even shoulder's weight loss beyond
[02:15:25.040 --> 02:15:30.160]  tangy tangerine pollen burst plus things like that osteo FX the special

[02:15:47.280 --> 02:15:51.720]  not going to go into a big pitch for the discounted young Jebedy products that
[02:15:51.720 --> 02:15:57.800]  are info wars health.com today I want to talk about Dr. Wallach here on air with
[02:15:57.800 --> 02:16:01.240]  him before we get into why are we the number one obese nation in the world
[02:16:01.240 --> 02:16:05.280]  30% is diabetics right now I'm going to 50% in the next 10 years that's a
[02:16:05.280 --> 02:16:09.760]  visual numbers doctors kill or injure 15 million Americans a year we're gonna go
[02:16:09.760 --> 02:16:12.920]  through all these points with him but I first wanted to get him to talk about
[02:16:12.920 --> 02:16:18.400]  himself and and talk about again recapping how you grew up being a
[02:16:18.400 --> 02:16:21.640]  veterinarian then a doctor what you discover what you did for the government
[02:16:21.640 --> 02:16:27.840]  and then all the times you've sued the Food and Drug Administration in one so
[02:16:27.840 --> 02:16:32.920]  many of the landmark cases that have even allowed any supplementation you were
[02:16:32.920 --> 02:16:36.640]  there even before you had young Jebedy fighting for so you're quite a tiger
[02:16:36.640 --> 02:16:40.760]  because it's a blueprint for victory so we were going to break it about four or
[02:16:40.760 --> 02:16:46.760]  five minutes not your wallet tell us tell us about yourself first of all Alex
[02:16:46.760 --> 02:16:50.240]  thank you so much for your hospitality really appreciate being here with you
[02:16:50.240 --> 02:16:54.840]  but my background is a little bit different I grew up on a farm in
[02:16:54.840 --> 02:17:01.920]  Missouri West St. Louis County a small Angus farm and went to ag school the
[02:17:01.920 --> 02:17:06.120]  University of Missouri and my major is an animal husbandry nutrition went to
[02:17:06.120 --> 02:17:09.880]  veterinary school and got into veterinary school halfway through ag school so as a
[02:17:09.880 --> 02:17:15.240]  graduate student after I graduated ag school wrote the first paper on a mass
[02:17:15.240 --> 02:17:19.320]  die-off in America from pollution got that published and that began to direct
[02:17:19.320 --> 02:17:24.840]  the rest of my career graduated veterinary school went to Africa for two
[02:17:24.840 --> 02:17:28.920]  years Marlon Perkins of the white rhino conservation project caught 200 of them
[02:17:28.920 --> 02:17:32.840]  brought them back so if you see white rhino in a wild animal park or zoo it's
[02:17:32.840 --> 02:17:38.520]  either one that I caught her offspring and was in Africa Marlon got a grant from
[02:17:38.520 --> 02:17:42.600]  the National Institute of Health to study pollution and zoo animals and people
[02:17:42.600 --> 02:17:47.000]  who lived in close proximity to the zoos as my job as a pathologist and I'd
[02:17:47.000 --> 02:17:51.520]  already become a published pathologist to do autopsies in the zoo animals and
[02:17:51.520 --> 02:17:55.560]  people who lived in close proximity to the zoo and find out what part pollution
[02:17:55.560 --> 02:18:00.360]  played in disease and make a long story short after 12 years I had done 20,000
[02:18:00.360 --> 02:18:07.080]  autopsies some 17,500 on over 454 species of zoo animals and 3,000 humans
[02:18:07.080 --> 02:18:12.000]  the 1200 page book that came out of that is in the Smithsonian Institute as a
[02:18:12.000 --> 02:18:16.520]  national treasure in the bottom line of that 12-year study Alex was a surprise
[02:18:16.520 --> 02:18:20.280]  because we were looking for pollution but what it said was every animal and every
[02:18:20.280 --> 02:18:24.600]  human being who dies of natural causes dies of a nutritional deficiency disease
[02:18:24.600 --> 02:18:33.480]  and that was a powerhouse and the last project I did for the that program I was
[02:18:33.480 --> 02:18:37.720]  at the Brookfield Zoo in the Shedd Aquarium in Chicago and then I went to
[02:18:37.720 --> 02:18:42.920]  the Yerkes primate center in Atlanta where I found the first case of non-human
[02:18:42.920 --> 02:18:46.760]  cystic fibrosis and found out what caused it and they fired me because I
[02:18:46.760 --> 02:18:49.840]  found out what caused cystic fibrosis because it was different than their
[02:18:49.840 --> 02:18:54.320]  theory the theory was genetic this is back in 1978 and again you can be
[02:18:54.320 --> 02:18:58.200]  predisposed genetically that if you have these deficiencies it triggers worse
[02:18:58.200 --> 02:19:01.640]  correct it's but then now they're just saying no everything's genetic they're
[02:19:01.640 --> 02:19:04.960]  now saying inner-city kids need to be locked up or put on drugs because they
[02:19:04.960 --> 02:19:09.280]  have bad genetics just blanket no studies no proof you're just scum but
[02:19:09.280 --> 02:19:13.760]  that's liberal well we can we can fix those kids I can take them if they've
[02:19:13.760 --> 02:19:17.560]  never spoken 11 years and six weeks time they're speaking I don't care if
[02:19:17.560 --> 02:19:21.800]  they're violent and crazy and can't sit still 30 seconds they got to get off the
[02:19:21.800 --> 02:19:25.520]  red dye number five and corn syrup and actually not eat white bread all day well
[02:19:25.520 --> 02:19:30.520]  yeah exactly and they have to take the Alex pack on top of that you're an
[02:19:30.520 --> 02:19:33.880]  extremist I that's what I've been told the kids are acting up because they're
[02:19:33.880 --> 02:19:37.720]  evil not because they're eating snickers all day and bouncing off the walls well
[02:19:37.720 --> 02:19:40.600]  they're actually deficient in nutrients and then you take a lot of carbohydrates
[02:19:40.600 --> 02:19:43.520]  and sugars which aggravates that I disagree they should eat nothing but
[02:19:43.520 --> 02:19:47.600]  but they should nothing but candy bars all day and McDonald's you are a
[02:19:47.600 --> 02:19:51.960]  conspiracy theorist McDonald's has everything you need in it and it's the
[02:19:51.960 --> 02:19:54.640]  reason we're so healthy I'm joking we're gonna come back and talk about your

[02:24:50.960 --> 02:24:54.920]  segment long segment coming up briefly well first off and people are watching
[02:24:54.920 --> 02:24:58.920]  you at prison planet dot TV you know I've seen you in a lot of speeches and
[02:24:58.920 --> 02:25:03.000]  things and I said you look like you're about 55 here in person I got to say
[02:25:03.000 --> 02:25:07.240]  I'm looking right at him and we can put a camera on him people say I look a lot
[02:25:07.240 --> 02:25:09.800]  older you know that I do for my age I mean I'm telling you buddy you look
[02:25:09.800 --> 02:25:14.840]  maximum 55 60 years old and again on the camera you look a little older and
[02:25:14.840 --> 02:25:19.960]  maybe 60 in person you look I mean you could pass for somebody who was 50 years
[02:25:19.960 --> 02:25:27.120]  old unbelievable and I mean I'm again I'm looking at this and and you have
[02:25:27.120 --> 02:25:31.840]  discovered that it's the essential 90 for life amazing but but briefly we're
[02:25:31.840 --> 02:25:34.880]  getting into that coming up and some of the things that this can you know really
[02:25:34.880 --> 02:25:38.920]  help people whether from your research or reverse and we've seen it with
[02:25:38.920 --> 02:25:42.960]  countless folks Ted Anderson's knee Ted Anderson's dab with Alzheimer's I mean
[02:25:42.960 --> 02:25:46.280]  when I go do events now people just flood up saying it's incredible I was in a
[02:25:46.280 --> 02:25:50.600]  wheelchair I was and the issue is the medical establishment knows all this
[02:25:50.600 --> 02:25:54.760]  stuff but doesn't want people to know it but but I'm already taking the whole
[02:25:54.760 --> 02:25:59.400]  segment up here talk about your battles with the FDA and your victories well
[02:25:59.400 --> 02:26:05.120]  during that 12-year study I did for the NIH that came out with that book go to
[02:26:05.120 --> 02:26:09.440]  found was that we could prevent birth defects like the neuro tube defects by
[02:26:09.440 --> 02:26:12.760]  supplementing with folic acid but you couldn't say that you can only say by
[02:26:12.760 --> 02:26:15.840]  eating foods rich in folic acid you could prevent the neuro tube defects so I
[02:26:15.840 --> 02:26:20.760]  had to sue them in federal court and prevailed I also was able to see that you
[02:26:20.760 --> 02:26:27.640]  could prevent the coronary thrombosis thrombotic stroke pulmonary embolism by
[02:26:27.640 --> 02:26:31.200]  supplementing with omega-3 essential fatty acids before I sued them in federal
[02:26:31.200 --> 02:26:35.040]  court you couldn't say that you can only say and I looked this up decades ago you
[02:26:35.040 --> 02:26:39.280]  did all this and said this now it's mainline science yes sorry I mean you're
[02:26:39.280 --> 02:26:43.400]  a trailblazer well yes you can say that and of course I didn't do that to make
[02:26:43.400 --> 02:26:46.760]  money off it because it was generic so everybody gets to use the information so
[02:26:46.760 --> 02:26:52.040]  it was really to save America well I mean here's the example vitamin E they
[02:26:52.040 --> 02:26:56.880]  say that's the most powerful you know thing for yeah well also for women to
[02:26:56.880 --> 02:27:01.560]  get pregnant they don't tell you that well for when you have somebody who's
[02:27:01.560 --> 02:27:07.440]  infertile and you can certainly with the Alex pack I mean you can tell people
[02:27:07.440 --> 02:27:12.160]  honestly that the Alex pack will get more women pregnant than Solomon I gotta
[02:27:12.160 --> 02:27:16.240]  say well I'm not gonna get into any stories here but that's the feedback
[02:27:16.240 --> 02:27:21.040]  we've been getting is 45 50 year old women are getting pregnant yes so look
[02:27:21.040 --> 02:27:25.240]  out folks yeah I've had women who are in their 60s going through menopause and I
[02:27:25.240 --> 02:27:28.000]  warn them be careful because you get pregnant here and certainly they've
[02:27:28.000 --> 02:27:32.840]  gotten pregnant healthy babies explain that to people well it takes nutrition
[02:27:32.840 --> 02:27:35.960]  for things to work and we don't have nutrition it's just like pulling the
[02:27:35.960 --> 02:27:39.920]  plug on a lamp and expecting to turn on and you put the plug back in turn on the
[02:27:39.920 --> 02:27:45.640]  light comes on the same thing with cycling ovulation making sperm if you
[02:27:45.640 --> 02:27:50.320]  take something like cholesterol or in drugs statin drugs you get on a cluster
[02:27:50.320 --> 02:27:53.120]  restricted diet you can't make testosterone so there's nobody home
[02:27:53.120 --> 02:27:58.000]  anymore okay so nothing works without nutrition I was about to say since I've
[02:27:58.000 --> 02:28:01.840]  been on this about a year and I'm still got weight to go folks I was really big
[02:28:01.840 --> 02:28:06.280]  but I've lost upwards of 40 pounds look great well thank you well I'm really
[02:28:06.280 --> 02:28:09.520]  my head's just giant and round but I get to go I'll do a thing where I take the
[02:28:09.520 --> 02:28:13.160]  shirt off it really is it is amazing what's happened but I've noticed my
[02:28:13.160 --> 02:28:16.720]  muscles have gotten bigger without doing weights I've lost fat but I've also got
[02:28:16.720 --> 02:28:21.520]  a lot more aggressive and I do want to say you know that my testosterone's gone
[02:28:21.520 --> 02:28:27.400]  up yeah you don't you don't need any of those creams no but I guess it just does
[02:28:27.400 --> 02:28:32.200]  that yes well it's the raw material to make a testosterone a guy your size should
[02:28:32.200 --> 02:28:37.040]  be in four to six eggs a day I try to get in four six eight eggs a day and four
[02:28:37.040 --> 02:28:40.880]  eggs for breakfast for the steak and all my supplements you know we're done in
[02:28:40.880 --> 02:28:43.760]  the evening we go to one of these places that serve breakfasts all day you're all
[02:28:43.760 --> 02:28:47.680]  24 hours have four poached eggs and a steak and the supplements so I do that
[02:28:47.680 --> 02:28:50.920]  twice a day and they bought you guys sandwiches but I noticed you took the
[02:28:50.920 --> 02:28:54.280]  took the weight off and just take the turkey yes I don't eat wheat because of
[02:28:54.280 --> 02:28:59.120]  gluten and that helps keep the weight off but also it improves the absorption
[02:28:59.120 --> 02:29:02.800]  and nutrients for your intestines even if you don't think you're gluten intolerant
[02:29:02.800 --> 02:29:06.320]  as many as 80% of Americans are gluten intolerant right now Alex and
[02:29:06.320 --> 02:29:12.280]  whether it's due to the GMO stuff in the grains that's made this happen 50 years
[02:29:12.280 --> 02:29:16.080]  ago maybe 5% of Americans were gluten intolerant now in some communities as
[02:29:16.080 --> 02:29:20.440]  high as 80% oh there's all these new allergies every day yes what's behind the

[02:34:06.280 --> 02:34:11.440]  than rather than coffee and i found that sometimes coffee gives me that speed
[02:34:11.440 --> 02:34:17.120]  freak feeling and then i just get a headache i don't have that problem with
[02:34:17.120 --> 02:34:23.080]  pollen burst plus and of course my face is also on the product because you know i
[02:34:23.080 --> 02:34:26.360]  told him i wanted to endorse pollen burst they said well listen a couple of

[02:34:30.000 --> 02:34:33.080]  coming out do you want to endorse that one so i was the first person to get
[02:34:33.080 --> 02:34:36.480]  them you know in little bags look like it was drugs or something didn't even have
[02:34:36.480 --> 02:34:40.120]  the packaging on it and i said yeah i like this even more than the regular
[02:34:40.120 --> 02:34:44.960]  pollen burst that's citrus flavored this is berry flavored it's like fruit punch
[02:34:44.960 --> 02:34:48.280]  you don't look like a kid i love it and it's got the bee pollen in it it's got
[02:34:48.280 --> 02:34:51.640]  the bee vitamins it's got a bunch of other stuff and it's got the the caffeine
[02:34:51.640 --> 02:34:56.920]  from green tea and it doesn't even have that much caffeine in it but it i just
[02:34:56.920 --> 02:35:04.800]  can't take energy drinks this one i love and i normally take it at about 130 so

[02:38:12.240 --> 02:38:17.840]  you're at sound perfect okay fantastic we're just in there playing with the
[02:38:17.840 --> 02:38:21.080]  old knobs that's what I like to do I've actually gone there before just I start
[02:38:21.080 --> 02:38:25.640]  hitting all buttons actually that's true people think I'm joking anyways going
[02:38:25.640 --> 02:38:28.600]  back to dr. Walik I'm gonna give you the floor now sir I've been doing my my
[02:38:28.600 --> 02:38:31.960]  pitch here because I believe it I only promote things I believe in but you I
[02:38:31.960 --> 02:38:33.480]  said what do you want to talk about during the break I've got all these
[02:38:33.480 --> 02:38:38.000]  points I want to ask but you said let's talk about Obamacare so tell us about
[02:38:38.000 --> 02:38:43.360]  you know the same government I mean people have the FDA certify as pertain
[02:38:43.360 --> 02:38:47.040]  all these poisons and people say well it's okay my product has asked for them
[02:38:47.040 --> 02:38:51.160]  the FDA says it's okay so now the death panels all of it what's your take on
[02:38:51.160 --> 02:38:56.640]  Obamacare well there's nothing in Obamacare that helps the patient that's
[02:38:56.640 --> 02:39:01.200]  so that's an overriding statement there's nothing that says will only pay you
[02:39:01.200 --> 02:39:03.760]  for this treatment because this is one that cured somebody this is one that
[02:39:03.760 --> 02:39:09.320]  works there's none of that the whole deal with Obamacare is finding ways to
[02:39:09.320 --> 02:39:14.160]  raise money to pay doctors more that's all Obamacare and let them not give you
[02:39:14.160 --> 02:39:17.320]  treatments that works as the insurance companies wrote it that's correct I mean
[02:39:17.320 --> 02:39:21.240]  they're saying no more probably we're not gonna cover pre-existing above 65 go
[02:39:21.240 --> 02:39:25.040]  get a cane if you want eye surgery they actually say this it's like oh it's
[02:39:25.040 --> 02:39:30.160]  liberal good I'm sorry go ahead that's right but you're exactly right and
[02:39:30.160 --> 02:39:34.840]  basically doctors now for the last six months and it's just speeding up they're
[02:39:34.840 --> 02:39:38.680]  actually putting up signs we no longer accept Medicare patients because the
[02:39:38.680 --> 02:39:42.360]  Medicare payments from Obamacare is gonna drop anywhere from 30 to 50%
[02:39:42.360 --> 02:39:46.640]  depending on where you are in your age the older you are the lesser wow that
[02:39:46.640 --> 02:39:49.560]  sounds good less money that's that's a free deal from the government what
[02:39:49.560 --> 02:39:54.080]  idiots supported that huh yeah and so there the doctors are actually putting
[02:39:54.080 --> 02:39:59.640]  up signs that say we no longer accept Medicare patients and there was a cover
[02:39:59.640 --> 02:40:07.720]  article in Newsweek magazine I think it was August of 2011 and it said that there
[02:40:07.720 --> 02:40:10.760]  was a big cover it goes showed a guy laying on a gurney and five surgeons are
[02:40:10.760 --> 02:40:15.920]  gonna stick them with a knife for the and it showed for seven doctors approaching
[02:40:15.920 --> 02:40:20.520]  him in his hospital gown and he's doing this defensive position you know no no
[02:40:20.520 --> 02:40:24.440]  and basically it's because he was the only one in the hospital with money
[02:40:24.440 --> 02:40:27.880]  everybody else has a Medicare patient and they are all fighting each other and
[02:40:27.880 --> 02:40:31.680]  playing hockey and chip body checking my dad's friend won the lawsuit because he
[02:40:31.680 --> 02:40:35.160]  went in for two stints they put 12 in him and the other doctors told him it
[02:40:35.160 --> 02:40:38.000]  basically is gonna kill him and he won the suit against the guy and the guy got
[02:40:38.000 --> 02:40:42.000]  kicked out but the point is these guys are pirates what yeah they're pirates I
[02:40:42.000 --> 02:40:49.520]  call them pre-grave robbers the cost of hospice for Medicare has gone up 70
[02:40:49.520 --> 02:40:54.160]  percent big headline news a couple months ago 70 percent has gone up and
[02:40:54.160 --> 02:40:58.120]  that's because when somebody comes in with say colon cancer has gone to the
[02:40:58.120 --> 02:41:01.520]  brain they're in a coma they got maybe a week to live with IVs they email all
[02:41:01.520 --> 02:41:05.960]  their buddies and they say come on in this gal here has got the fourth stage
[02:41:05.960 --> 02:41:09.800]  colon cancer it's in her brain but she's got $300,000 between her private
[02:41:09.800 --> 02:41:13.320]  insurance and Medicare left they come in they do a double mastectomy double
[02:41:13.320 --> 02:41:16.160]  hip replacement double knee replacement they do a hysterectomy take her
[02:41:16.160 --> 02:41:19.880]  thyroid gland out do cataract surgeries make ever the Darth Vader treatment
[02:41:19.880 --> 02:41:23.600]  exactly then they pull the plug call the family say a granny Daisy took a turn
[02:41:23.600 --> 02:41:27.440]  for the worst and she's the way they sell it is while we've got her under
[02:41:27.440 --> 02:41:30.320]  we're gonna fix the hips the eyes everything they know full well she's
[02:41:30.320 --> 02:41:34.400]  dead in the three weeks but it doesn't matter they're gonna black off her yeah
[02:41:34.400 --> 02:41:37.160]  they don't want exactly they don't want that money going to the grave with her
[02:41:37.160 --> 02:41:40.560]  they believe it's their money and they're gonna get it from her and that's
[02:41:40.560 --> 02:41:47.000]  why the cost of Medicare hospice has gone up 70 percent huge huge headlines
[02:41:47.000 --> 02:41:50.040]  that's why I use in my presentation because people say that can't be right
[02:41:50.040 --> 02:41:56.360]  actually have one pharmacist who said DeWalek you got to be exaggerating
[02:41:56.360 --> 02:42:00.840]  because I oversee the pharmacies of over 200 hospices I'm gonna double check on
[02:42:00.840 --> 02:42:05.320]  it he called me two weeks later Alex literally a grown man crying he says doc
[02:42:05.320 --> 02:42:11.520]  he's is worse than even you said I know some very wealthy people here in town
[02:42:11.520 --> 02:42:16.880]  and the mother got bitten by a rattlesnake in the backyard we have
[02:42:16.880 --> 02:42:22.000]  those here and they took her and the bill was something like 300 and something
[02:42:22.000 --> 02:42:26.120]  thousand dollars for the Annie venom in a two-day stay in the hospital and she
[02:42:26.120 --> 02:42:31.840]  was fine she's went to the hospital and they I mean just in a bed that I mean
[02:42:31.840 --> 02:42:36.200]  this country and they had insurance too it's it's just totally criminal well
[02:42:36.200 --> 02:42:38.600]  that's why it was three hundred thousand dollars because they had insurance
[02:42:38.600 --> 02:42:44.160]  insurance is the thing that's broken the back of America because medical doctors
[02:42:44.160 --> 02:42:48.840]  have learned how to game the insurance policy a friend since Alex we know how
[02:42:48.840 --> 02:42:52.760]  to cure this is not me this is medical schools done the research we've known
[02:42:52.760 --> 02:42:56.520]  for 50 years how to cure rheumatoid arthritis in two weeks it's actually
[02:42:56.520 --> 02:43:01.360]  an infection with a bug called mycoplasma you give a antibiotic called
[02:43:01.360 --> 02:43:06.400]  minocycline like a little baitfish minocycline in two weeks time rheumatoid
[02:43:06.400 --> 02:43:09.920]  arthritis is gone the doctor only makes $300 the pharmacy makes a thousand bucks
[02:43:09.920 --> 02:43:15.160]  for the antibiotics if they treat you for 25 years and make $750,000 that's
[02:43:15.160 --> 02:43:19.240]  like a limes to they know the cures for that of course now limes is just it's a
[02:43:19.240 --> 02:43:22.920]  cousin to syphilis you can cure syphilis in a week with penicillin you can
[02:43:22.920 --> 02:43:27.920]  cure limes in a week with tetracycline so why do they treat you for 12 15 20
[02:43:27.920 --> 02:43:31.080]  years well because there's no law saying they have to cure you and there's a cure
[02:43:31.080 --> 02:43:34.400]  available and so they always opt for treating you over long periods of time
[02:43:34.400 --> 02:43:39.440]  rather than curing you and so this is the difference between them and us we
[02:43:39.440 --> 02:43:43.720]  actually take the things that are published in medical journals that say
[02:43:43.720 --> 02:43:47.120]  this bug can be killed with this antibiotic or this this cartilage can be
[02:43:47.120 --> 02:43:51.560]  regrown doing this we can make you an X diabetic by giving you these things but
[02:43:51.560 --> 02:43:54.000]  listen you know a year and a half ago I've been promoting this two years I knew
[02:43:54.000 --> 02:43:56.960]  it was good products but I barely promoted it because I hardly ever even
[02:43:56.960 --> 02:44:00.800]  plug my sponsors I'm so busy my main focus isn't making money though I need
[02:44:00.800 --> 02:44:05.880]  to to fund the operation but Ted Anderson's dad didn't know who he was
[02:44:05.880 --> 02:44:11.960]  and Ted allows me to tell this story it's very sad and you know great guy
[02:44:11.960 --> 02:44:18.020]  whole nine yards he got him on beyond tangy tangerine osteo FX and essential
[02:44:18.020 --> 02:44:22.280]  fatty acids and in a few months knew who he was could go fishing his dad was
[02:44:22.280 --> 02:44:26.280]  back the rotholes in his skin healed you went to the doctor the test the
[02:44:26.280 --> 02:44:28.640]  blood they said you got vitamin care not allowed green vegetables what are you
[02:44:28.640 --> 02:44:32.640]  over on this stuff oh no way this has got vitamins and minerals in it because
[02:44:32.640 --> 02:44:36.520]  we got you on Qumitan we were and within a few months his dad didn't know who he
[02:44:36.520 --> 02:44:40.840]  was again and and and it's a priesthood it's like and I don't want to get into
[02:44:40.840 --> 02:44:45.400]  it well Ted was allowed me to say it his mother God bless her soul said listen
[02:44:45.400 --> 02:44:48.280]  I'm in charge and this is what's good that we're gonna do what the doctor says
[02:44:48.280 --> 02:44:53.520]  hmm I mean that's a you know that's incredible well this happens all the
[02:44:53.520 --> 02:44:57.880]  time especially with people who are a little older people over age 60 because
[02:44:57.880 --> 02:45:02.080]  they've grown up with doctors being the demigods right and whatever the doctor
[02:45:02.080 --> 02:45:05.600]  says they're gonna do this well that's interesting but you know I've got it I
[02:45:05.600 --> 02:45:09.360]  got my diabetes under control I got my head blood pressure under control so we
[02:45:09.360 --> 02:45:13.680]  help people of that age who want to help Alex but also what we want to do is get
[02:45:13.680 --> 02:45:18.600]  kids going before they're conceived we got to talk to young girls before they're
[02:45:18.600 --> 02:45:22.760]  old enough to have their own families get them taking these nutrients so they'll
[02:45:22.760 --> 02:45:26.200]  never have a baby born with Down syndrome or cerebral palsy or cleft
[02:45:26.200 --> 02:45:29.960]  palate or muscular history cysts fibrosis we can prevent all that we've done it in
[02:45:29.960 --> 02:45:33.000]  animals I just use those same principles in humans at works they've been doing it
[02:45:33.000 --> 02:45:38.640]  for 35 years I publish it and I'm still outside of jail so I can't be saying
[02:45:38.640 --> 02:45:44.120]  something wrong for 35 years and the doctors will not do this it took a
[02:45:44.120 --> 02:45:49.760]  thousand years to change the concept of spontaneous generation before Van
[02:45:49.760 --> 02:45:53.080]  Loon hoked the microscope guy and pastured the bacteria guy discovered
[02:45:53.080 --> 02:45:57.640]  microbes exactly explains spontaneous generation I actually had somebody work
[02:45:57.640 --> 02:46:01.480]  for me one time I go there's always flies in the office he was he was leaving
[02:46:01.480 --> 02:46:05.440]  the bathroom window open and he said no the flies are coming out of the trash
[02:46:05.440 --> 02:46:10.120]  can I said no they're not spontaneously generating those the Greeks you know they
[02:46:10.120 --> 02:46:15.160]  thought maggots you know just came out of nowhere out of meat exactly and that
[02:46:15.160 --> 02:46:20.080]  because they didn't know about genetics and they didn't know about eggs and they
[02:46:20.080 --> 02:46:23.840]  didn't know about flies laying eggs and things like that and so that was a thing
[02:46:23.840 --> 02:46:27.560]  that went on for 2,000 years spontaneous generation was the theory of the land
[02:46:27.560 --> 02:46:31.960]  when it came to flies and maggots appearing they thought little fish just
[02:46:31.960 --> 02:46:36.360]  appeared in streams exactly they didn't know about the egg thing and so it took
[02:46:36.360 --> 02:46:42.240]  Van Loon hoked eyeglass maker from Switzerland I guess he was Dutch is
[02:46:42.240 --> 02:46:48.160]  from Holland and he came up put two eyeglass lenses together in the tube
[02:46:48.160 --> 02:46:51.960]  and magnified things so you can actually see sperm moving they've freaked them out
[02:46:51.960 --> 02:46:55.920]  they'd never seen that before and you can see it was like discovering a whole
[02:46:55.920 --> 02:46:59.400]  new universe exactly and then now they're discovering little things inside
[02:46:59.400 --> 02:47:02.960]  little things little things inside little things little side and exactly but
[02:47:02.960 --> 02:47:05.680]  they don't want to tell you what microplasm is we're just gonna let you
[02:47:05.680 --> 02:47:08.880]  die over a long period of time well here's one on that one there's another
[02:47:08.880 --> 02:47:12.480]  one you've heard of quite so Jacob's disease mad cow disease in people yeah
[02:47:12.480 --> 02:47:20.560]  well actually it's prions do not cause disease they've taken prions from mad
[02:47:20.560 --> 02:47:24.920]  cows ground them up put them in the brains of a thousand cows normal cows
[02:47:24.920 --> 02:47:28.160]  haven't transmitted yeah I've seen those studies yeah they haven't transmitted
[02:47:28.160 --> 02:47:30.760]  they've tried but they haven't transmitted the same way with taking out of
[02:47:30.760 --> 02:47:35.440]  a human brain with Christville Jacob's disease put it into monkeys and chimpanzees
[02:47:35.440 --> 02:47:39.240]  they have not transmitted it well there's actually I'm a pathologist so I
[02:47:39.240 --> 02:47:43.240]  look at the brains from mad cows I look at the disease in sheep that's called
[02:47:43.240 --> 02:47:48.880]  enzoatic a taxia from 100 years ago and guess what it's the same disease well I
[02:47:48.880 --> 02:47:53.920]  know it causes enzoatic a tax in sheep so the first case I got from Holmes
[02:47:53.920 --> 02:48:00.280]  County Ohio for Christville Jacob's disease mad cow disease in people this
[02:48:00.280 --> 02:48:03.480]  guy had to have the disease for a year he was in a terminal stages and I treat
[02:48:03.480 --> 02:48:07.120]  him like it would a sheep with enzoatic a taxier cow with mad cow disease in a
[02:48:07.120 --> 02:48:12.480]  two months time his doctor declared him perfectly normal incredible how did you
[02:48:12.480 --> 02:48:17.360]  so what did you treat him with the Alex pack seriously and you call the Alice
[02:48:17.360 --> 02:48:22.720]  the Alex pack the osteo FX the essential fatty acids and beyond tangy
[02:48:22.720 --> 02:48:27.400]  tangerine what was happening with Ted Anderson's dad on the Alex pack in just
[02:48:27.400 --> 02:48:31.200]  three to four months okay what's happening there Alex is your brain
[02:48:31.200 --> 02:48:35.720]  requires all 90 a sense of nutrients you can't get it from your food it's
[02:48:35.720 --> 02:48:40.160]  impossible to get from your food we used to get minerals for food because we put
[02:48:40.160 --> 02:48:44.520]  the wood ashes which are really minerals when you burn the wood of the trees that
[02:48:44.520 --> 02:48:47.400]  the powder that's left is not ashes really minerals and you put in the
[02:48:47.400 --> 02:48:50.800]  garden you ate the okra and the sweet potatoes and the corn and the tomatoes
[02:48:50.800 --> 02:48:53.840]  and things you got minerals in that fashion well how many wood ashes do we
[02:48:53.840 --> 02:48:56.400]  put in the garden now and eat entirely out of the garden very few people in
[02:48:56.400 --> 02:49:00.560]  America do that and so we don't get the minerals well the Alex pack has all the
[02:49:00.560 --> 02:49:04.640]  minerals in it that are necessary and there actually is a vitamin there's one
[02:49:04.640 --> 02:49:08.600]  vitamin that causes disease called Corsica syndrome that looks exactly like
[02:49:08.600 --> 02:49:13.000]  Alzheimer's disease and I am able to eliminate that disease and people usually
[02:49:13.000 --> 02:49:17.200]  in a week or two by giving them the Alex pack because it's a simple to they got
[02:49:17.200 --> 02:49:20.200]  to give him off a sugar too because sugar makes that deficiency that vitamin
[02:49:20.200 --> 02:49:26.720]  worse it was actually discovered in the year 1712 by a Japanese naval surgeon
[02:49:26.720 --> 02:49:33.600]  we've known for 300 years now if the degenerations gone too far though I've
[02:49:33.600 --> 02:49:37.240]  talked to dr. Blalock and you've got that chronic inflammation from the sugar
[02:49:37.240 --> 02:49:42.880]  the aspartame the msg you know sometimes the brain is too far gone you know from
[02:49:42.880 --> 02:49:46.480]  damage that's true there's always that position because it wants to go away
[02:49:46.480 --> 02:49:49.640]  everything wants to go away that's why I have to take these nutrients every day
[02:49:49.640 --> 02:49:53.200]  it's just like you need oxygen all day you can't just take oxygen and there's
[02:49:53.200 --> 02:49:57.720]  also trauma from playing football and stuff sure that all counts but for the
[02:49:57.720 --> 02:50:01.600]  most part what we've learned when people have this Corsica syndrome which looks
[02:50:01.600 --> 02:50:07.800]  like Alzheimer's disease 95% of the time they get so much better they come from
[02:50:07.800 --> 02:50:12.400]  but imagine the doctor when I mean it was dramatic and they're like oh but you
[02:50:12.400 --> 02:50:16.600]  might have a stroke if you've got vitamin K go keep taking your cumin and
[02:50:16.600 --> 02:50:20.560]  even though he's ever had a stroke yeah well he could continue taking
[02:50:20.560 --> 02:50:23.920]  cumin if his wife wants him to take him why were why were the rotholes in the arm
[02:50:23.920 --> 02:50:27.920]  going away you always see these old people with just these big bloody balls
[02:50:27.920 --> 02:50:32.080]  on their arms your arms look like a 30 year old guy's arms look at that that's
[02:50:32.080 --> 02:50:37.560]  amazing you're and you're almost 70 right 73 73 excuse me oh my eyes it's hard
[02:50:37.560 --> 02:50:43.760]  to believe 73 look at that arm folks zoom in on that I see a 73 year old man's
[02:50:43.760 --> 02:50:49.240]  arm hangs out my truck window it's a little browner but um yeah yeah nobody's
[02:50:49.240 --> 02:50:53.240]  gonna steal an airplane with me on it Alex we'll be right back stay with us
[02:50:53.240 --> 02:50:58.160]  dr. Joel Wallach is our guest we'll get into the really key news straight ahead
[02:51:00.520 --> 02:51:05.440]  don't throw away leftovers instead throw all your leftovers vegetable peels
[02:51:05.440 --> 02:51:09.520]  eggshells coffee grounds pizza crusts and more into the bocci if you love to
[02:51:09.520 --> 02:51:12.880]  garden and compost but don't like the hassle of turning a compost bin or this
[02:51:12.880 --> 02:51:17.000]  smell then check out the EM bocci food waste recycling system from tarragonics
[02:51:17.000 --> 02:51:21.040]  finally a way to recycle all your food and plant waste safely and effectively

[02:52:10.120 --> 02:52:13.240]  hadn't heard about this yet because the liberal media has been suppressing what
[02:52:13.240 --> 02:52:19.040]  is fast becoming the most shocking news story of 2012 Obama's secret war on
[02:52:19.040 --> 02:52:23.240]  coal that could increase your already high-power bill as much as 400% in

[02:52:31.800 --> 02:52:37.240]  there's an underground video at exposed123.com that thousands of smart
[02:52:37.240 --> 02:52:41.880]  patriots have used to end their slavery to the corrupt electricity monopoly the
[02:52:41.880 --> 02:52:46.600]  video at exposed123.com has already been banned by Google and the liberal
[02:52:46.600 --> 02:52:50.240]  media is doing everything in its power to take it down and keep America in the

[02:53:07.480 --> 02:53:13.600]  in 2010 then I learned about RNA drops I learned that 97% of my DNA that
[02:53:13.600 --> 02:53:17.680]  scientists have called junk is actually packed with millions of gene switches
[02:53:17.680 --> 02:53:22.040]  that play a critical role in controlling how my cells organs and other tissues
[02:53:22.040 --> 02:53:26.080]  behave I learned I don't have to put up with disease decay or decline like I've
[02:53:26.080 --> 02:53:31.200]  been conditioned to believe I began taking RNA drops a 100% natural formula
[02:53:31.200 --> 02:53:35.200]  designed to turn on those switches and provide me with amazing health and joy

[02:53:59.880 --> 02:54:19.600]  now folks we're gonna go into the fourth hour with dr. Joel Wallach and we'll open
[02:54:19.600 --> 02:54:23.640]  the phones up as well but I wanted to bring him a question because some of
[02:54:23.640 --> 02:54:27.280]  their brands of plant-derived minerals and I've also seen this at Whole Foods
[02:54:27.280 --> 02:54:31.160]  with other companies that have copied what dr. Wallach's done it will say may
[02:54:31.160 --> 02:54:37.960]  contain trace amounts of lead arsenic or then it goes on and says aluminum but
[02:54:37.960 --> 02:54:42.520]  then you'll notice on Beyond Tangy Tangerine it doesn't say that and I know
[02:54:42.520 --> 02:54:45.280]  they've I was talking to your son Steve Wallach they've actually gone I had some
[02:54:45.280 --> 02:54:50.520]  big old university look at it and they can't even find trace amounts it's just
[02:54:50.520 --> 02:54:54.200]  that big companies it was recommended years ago because it's plant-derived
[02:54:54.200 --> 02:54:57.400]  when you're eating an apple it's gonna have stuff that's out of the dirt they
[02:54:57.400 --> 02:55:02.000]  say this but it's not like when you're vaccine injecting something in you but
[02:55:02.000 --> 02:55:05.960]  that's something that the establishment has certainly been upset about you know
[02:55:05.960 --> 02:55:09.360]  trying to say that oh you know this is evil and horrible but I've noticed with
[02:55:09.360 --> 02:55:12.920]  a lot of the high-quality sea salts it'll have that as well but unfortunately I
[02:55:12.920 --> 02:55:17.880]  was it's it's not on the packaging now and I was talking to Steve Wallach even
[02:55:17.880 --> 02:55:20.520]  on the some of the other packaging they're gonna take it off because they
[02:55:20.520 --> 02:55:23.800]  did the test because you're saying you actually do and my dad's always said
[02:55:23.800 --> 02:55:28.120]  this one very small amounts of it bound with the other things cuz somehow from
[02:55:28.120 --> 02:55:32.520]  the studies he's talked about it activates things but you've got the floor on
[02:55:32.520 --> 02:55:36.120]  the subject break down exactly what you're talking about okay well first of
[02:55:36.120 --> 02:55:39.760]  all all vertebrates whether you're a hummingbird or an elephant or a snake or
[02:55:39.760 --> 02:55:45.280]  a human we all need 60 minerals 60 minerals and these minerals include
[02:55:45.280 --> 02:55:48.760]  things like arsenic and lead and aluminum these are essential nutrients
[02:55:48.760 --> 02:55:52.120]  but there is a bell shaped curve for all essential nutrients for instance
[02:55:52.120 --> 02:55:57.280]  something like vitamin C if it has a bell shaped curve that looks like air is
[02:55:57.280 --> 02:56:01.480]  rock in Australia you know it's just a flat thing forever before it comes down
[02:56:01.480 --> 02:56:04.120]  work too much will do you some good you get diarrhea if you take too much
[02:56:04.120 --> 02:56:10.120]  vitamin C the same thing is true the arsenic arsenic from research back to
[02:56:10.120 --> 02:56:17.160]  1947 shows that you can actually eliminate the worst type of leukemia by
[02:56:17.160 --> 02:56:20.800]  supplementing with arsenic well that's what my dad when I was a kid would talk
[02:56:20.800 --> 02:56:24.360]  about he said that if you don't have arsenic you'll die your hair will fall
[02:56:24.360 --> 02:56:28.200]  out I mean I mean I mean your hair's got it in it well yeah you have to have
[02:56:28.200 --> 02:56:32.000]  arsenic and you notice that the EPA never says we're working towards an
[02:56:32.000 --> 02:56:36.120]  arsenic-free world no no they say it has to be below a certain level because
[02:56:36.120 --> 02:56:39.880]  again that's that bell shaped curve thing and the optimal amounts are in
[02:56:39.880 --> 02:56:43.600]  parts per billions and tiny tiny little but unfortunately they've done the test
[02:56:43.600 --> 02:56:47.000]  it's not even in that and that's about to so I mean I guess you need to add
[02:56:47.000 --> 02:56:51.880]  some well I believe it's in there I think they use a standard test that's
[02:56:51.880 --> 02:56:55.240]  not sensitive enough to find the amount but the point is a lot of supplement
[02:56:55.240 --> 02:56:59.200]  companies put that on I guess because the government said so or something what
[02:56:59.200 --> 02:57:05.320]  about the warning yeah oh yeah that doesn't bother me because we tested we
[02:57:05.320 --> 02:57:08.680]  test every batch and we make sure that it's below that parts per billion no no
[02:57:08.680 --> 02:57:11.600]  but I understand but explain what a plant derived mineral is anyways that's
[02:57:11.600 --> 02:57:16.560]  that's what used to be put on the crops well yeah and basically where the plant
[02:57:16.560 --> 02:57:20.000]  derived minerals came from was the powder that was left in the wood stove in
[02:57:20.000 --> 02:57:23.400]  the in the fireplace in the fire pit you notice they didn't call it wood ashes
[02:57:23.400 --> 02:57:26.960]  because it's really not ashes the powder that was left that gray powder this
[02:57:26.960 --> 02:57:31.360]  left when you burn logs in a fireplace or in a wood stove it was taken out every
[02:57:31.360 --> 02:57:34.280]  morning and put into the garden well that powder was actually in the minerals
[02:57:34.280 --> 02:57:36.960]  that the tree had sucked up out of the ground so where do you get yours I know
[02:57:36.960 --> 02:57:43.800]  where you do but tell us well actually there's a deposit in Utah that has all
[02:57:43.800 --> 02:57:49.880]  probably a 500 year supply of everybody in the world uses it correctly and this
[02:57:49.880 --> 02:57:54.600]  has 77 minerals in it it's in a compost it's in plant material so we're able to
[02:57:54.600 --> 02:58:00.120]  get it certified organic every year for 35 years it's a 3,000 foot elevation so
[02:58:00.120 --> 02:58:03.320]  it's an alluvial deposit of plant material that's exactly but it's a plant
[02:58:03.320 --> 02:58:11.080]  material and it's covered by a 25 to 50 foot thick cap of limestones marine
[02:58:11.080 --> 02:58:15.120]  limestone because we know because it has marine animal fossils and marine plant
[02:58:15.120 --> 02:58:19.000]  fossils and it's so this stuff was under the sea for thousands of years the
[02:58:19.000 --> 02:58:23.280]  earth is just filled with all sorts of goodies exactly so this is the basis
[02:58:23.280 --> 02:58:29.320]  this is what makes the Alec pack unique it has these 90 cents annuctions but of
[02:58:29.320 --> 02:58:33.080]  that two-thirds of them are these plant minerals so it's ocean silt I mean all
[02:58:33.080 --> 02:58:36.440]  that life and hold on we're gonna come right back straight ahead with Dr. Joel
[02:58:36.440 --> 02:58:45.440]  Wallach in force health.com check it out today thank you for listening to GCN

[02:59:01.440 --> 02:59:04.840]  agricultural history and now the economic results of the presidential
[02:59:04.840 --> 02:59:08.560]  election this perfect storm is a huge threat to everyone's food supply I

[03:00:11.360 --> 03:00:16.000]  We're live ladies and gentlemen and Dr. Joel Wallach is with us we're gonna open
[03:00:16.000 --> 03:00:20.320]  the phones up in the next segment I'll give out that toll-free number for your
[03:00:20.320 --> 03:00:25.800]  questions or comments for Dr. Joel Wallach host of dead doctors don't lie
[03:00:25.800 --> 03:00:31.440]  who is here with us today in studio and he's gonna put on events tonight and
[03:00:31.440 --> 03:00:35.160]  tomorrow night in Austin Texas we'll give you that information out as well
[03:00:35.160 --> 03:00:39.480]  before he leaves this okay finishing up with the plant-derived minerals you know
[03:00:39.480 --> 03:00:43.000]  I did my research on this and again this package doesn't say may contain the
[03:00:43.000 --> 03:00:46.360]  traces but you've got some of the pure mineral packs you know that that say
[03:00:46.360 --> 03:00:48.800]  that but oh you guys are removing that just because you don't even have to have
[03:00:48.800 --> 03:00:52.560]  that on there this I just guess that's been going on some other companies do
[03:00:52.560 --> 03:00:56.760]  it you guys decided to do it but the point is I give this to my children the
[03:00:56.760 --> 03:01:01.760]  point is my mother takes this I take this and it's just amazing that the power
[03:01:01.760 --> 03:01:05.680]  structure is so scared of this that they would try to put out rumors and
[03:01:05.680 --> 03:01:09.800]  things to demonize beyond Tangy tangerine and things like that because you
[03:01:09.800 --> 03:01:13.520]  know they tell you you don't need 90 vitamins and minerals they they tell you
[03:01:13.520 --> 03:01:16.560]  you don't I mean hospitals they admit have the most unhealthy food out there
[03:01:16.560 --> 03:01:20.360]  talk about what some of the deficiencies in vitamins and minerals
[03:01:20.360 --> 03:01:24.160]  cause as you were telling me during the break about a lemon
[03:01:24.160 --> 03:01:27.360]  aluminum is the most common mineral in the crust of the earth that's why it's so
[03:01:27.360 --> 03:01:31.760]  cheap is used for everything and that makes up 12% of the Earth's crust I
[03:01:31.760 --> 03:01:35.880]  guarantee you that if I were to do a hair analysis of every vegan and American
[03:01:35.880 --> 03:01:39.640]  every vegetarian American if you look at their hair analysis the mineral that's
[03:01:39.640 --> 03:01:43.760]  gonna give the biggest spike is gonna be aluminum okay you cannot eat a carrot
[03:01:43.760 --> 03:01:46.640]  you cannot eat a tomato anything was grown in the earth is gonna have more
[03:01:46.640 --> 03:01:50.640]  aluminum in it than any other mineral in there and so people are insane if they're
[03:01:50.640 --> 03:01:55.320]  afraid of aluminum because it's everywhere that's what Dr. Blalock says
[03:01:55.320 --> 03:02:01.120]  he says it's when they injected in in a vaccine with with the tetanus or whatever
[03:02:01.120 --> 03:02:06.280]  it is it causes an adjuvant effect with that and confuses the body that it's the
[03:02:06.280 --> 03:02:10.960]  boosting effect of the aluminum on on the pathogen that's causing the auto
[03:02:10.960 --> 03:02:14.840]  immune response yeah yeah it's not the aluminum it's indirectly it is but it's
[03:02:14.840 --> 03:02:19.440]  not the aluminum directly because of the problem but anyway when you have a
[03:02:19.440 --> 03:02:24.840]  deficiency of aluminum you get four arms six arms six legs and talk about a
[03:02:24.840 --> 03:02:28.080]  spider-man right well there is a couple years ago there was this little girl in
[03:02:28.080 --> 03:02:32.200]  India who had forearms and four legs and her mother was deficient in aluminum
[03:02:32.200 --> 03:02:35.480]  well if it makes up 12% of the Earth's crust how could she be deficient when
[03:02:35.480 --> 03:02:39.520]  she had gluten intolerance she couldn't absorb enough aluminum and the babies
[03:02:39.520 --> 03:02:43.040]  born with all these limbs know this happened many many times over the years
[03:02:43.040 --> 03:02:47.800]  because they have these statues of these gods in India it's Krishna that has
[03:02:47.800 --> 03:02:54.240]  forearms and four legs a very famous Indian god and so aluminum even an
[03:02:54.240 --> 03:02:57.560]  adult you get a type of liver cirrhosis when you don't have enough aluminum so
[03:02:57.560 --> 03:03:02.800]  you need it okay just need it in parts per million the same way with arsenic
[03:03:02.800 --> 03:03:05.960]  good but then there's a difference between sodium fluoride that you need
[03:03:05.960 --> 03:03:09.960]  some of I mean calcium fluoride and sodium fluoride and they manipulate the
[03:03:09.960 --> 03:03:13.280]  structure and make it a deadly acid and then when I've what doctors have
[03:03:13.280 --> 03:03:17.520]  explained us here but but break this down it then fills up the thyroid so the
[03:03:17.520 --> 03:03:22.600]  good things can't get in it's a blocker right mm-hmm well yeah of course the
[03:03:22.600 --> 03:03:26.280]  thyroid is a funny organ it requires all 90 essential nutrients
[03:03:26.280 --> 03:03:30.520]  variglian requires all 90 essential nutrients kind of funny you ask your
[03:03:30.520 --> 03:03:33.560]  doctor what's your thyroid need they'll say iodine well iodine is part of the
[03:03:33.560 --> 03:03:37.800]  structure of the hormone but to function the thyroid needs all 90
[03:03:37.800 --> 03:03:40.800]  essential nutrients 60 minerals 16 vitamins 12-centimeter essence
[03:03:40.800 --> 03:03:45.880]  essential fatty acids and anything that interferes with that is going to cause
[03:03:45.880 --> 03:03:49.400]  as a thyroid doesn't work they test you and say well all your lab tests are
[03:03:49.400 --> 03:03:52.040]  normal we don't know why your thyroid is not working well it might be missing
[03:03:52.040 --> 03:03:56.160]  copper it might be missing selenium might be missing zinc because it needs all
[03:03:56.160 --> 03:04:01.400]  of them one of my favorites of course is thiamine vitamin B1 a congestive
[03:04:01.400 --> 03:04:04.880]  heart failure the most common cause of heart death in America is caused by a
[03:04:04.880 --> 03:04:09.560]  thiamine vitamin B1 deficiency it's it's it's actually caused by what a

[03:09:35.440 --> 03:09:38.840]  drop dead each year in America we're talking about people who work in an
[03:09:38.840 --> 03:09:42.400]  office and they'll jog over the lunch hour and they drop dead we're talking
[03:09:42.400 --> 03:09:45.960]  about cutting up the heart disease which is a slim deficient marathon runners
[03:09:45.960 --> 03:09:52.560]  exactly 75,000 100,000 each year according to the Center for Zs control
[03:09:52.560 --> 03:09:56.960]  and some of them die of a ruptured aortic aneurysm the copper deficiency
[03:09:56.960 --> 03:10:00.880]  cutting up the heart disease one of the more common ones and I've done 1200
[03:10:00.880 --> 03:10:05.600]  autopsies 1200 autopsies on kids under the age of 10 that have died of a
[03:10:05.600 --> 03:10:10.400]  cardiomyopathy heart attack okay and this is so tragic when all you have to do
[03:10:10.400 --> 03:10:13.880]  all you have to do is give them the alex pack appropriate for their body
[03:10:13.880 --> 03:10:18.240]  weight give them a little extra of the rebound beginning all these nutrients
[03:10:18.240 --> 03:10:22.640]  and you'll avoid all that will save 75,000 to a hundred thousand great kids
[03:10:22.640 --> 03:10:28.440]  every year unbelievable I knew multiple kids playing football that just dropped
[03:10:28.440 --> 03:10:34.640]  dead and died in Rockwall yep people can look up when I was at Rockwall middle
[03:10:34.640 --> 03:10:40.600]  school and then high school and you can look it up back in the 80s and there
[03:10:40.600 --> 03:10:43.480]  were two deaths while I was there just where they down the football field and
[03:10:43.480 --> 03:10:47.360]  dropped dead yep that's how it happens ruptured aneurysm you're playing
[03:10:47.360 --> 03:10:51.080]  everything's fine you go up for rebound you come down you're dead same way with
[03:10:51.080 --> 03:10:55.120]  cardiomyopathy heart attack Reggie Lewis 28 years old he died of a cardiomyopathy
[03:10:55.120 --> 03:10:58.720]  heart attack all they had to do is give him the alex pack and 50 cents worth
[03:10:58.720 --> 03:11:03.680]  of selenium he's still be alive today because the heart's that big thick muscle
[03:11:03.680 --> 03:11:06.760]  that just keeps working and keeps pumping and it's electrochemical what
[03:11:06.760 --> 03:11:10.600]  happens doc when that when it doesn't have what it needs which is stops okay
[03:11:10.600 --> 03:11:13.760]  it's just like again that lamp you pull the plug doesn't have what it needs there's
[03:11:13.760 --> 03:11:17.000]  not a flow of electrons going through there light bulb goes heart runs out of
[03:11:17.000 --> 03:11:21.000]  gas it's over that's right and it's better that you put the oil in the car
[03:11:21.000 --> 03:11:25.360]  before the engine burns up now and as you get older your heart your guts get
[03:11:25.360 --> 03:11:28.880]  more and more clogged you're not getting what you need that heart still boom boom
[03:11:28.880 --> 03:11:33.480]  boom 24 hours a day you know the reason why I look 50 and I'm 73 Alex I've been
[03:11:33.480 --> 03:11:37.920]  taking the 90th sense of nutrients twice a day since I was nine started
[03:11:37.920 --> 03:11:41.040]  taking was nine now you're saying you discovered this yourself but it's kind
[03:11:41.040 --> 03:11:44.680]  of like discovering you know when you're 14 how beautiful women are I'm not
[03:11:44.680 --> 03:11:48.360]  taking your your discovery away you've helped popularizing everything but when
[03:11:48.360 --> 03:11:52.520]  I worked for Jess Edkins large animal vet off and on for three years in each
[03:11:52.520 --> 03:11:55.280]  Texas they sent me down there on the summer and then one time I got in
[03:11:55.280 --> 03:11:58.040]  trouble when I was a sophomore they sent me I was out of school for a year they
[03:11:58.040 --> 03:12:00.480]  sent me down there they said this will teach you you're going down to work on
[03:12:00.480 --> 03:12:04.240]  you know a large animal vet you know for most of a year is about nine months
[03:12:04.240 --> 03:12:07.080]  believe me I was ready to come back and behave after that that that guy worked
[03:12:07.080 --> 03:12:10.600]  like a still working anyways looks like grizzly atoms people know what I'm
[03:12:10.600 --> 03:12:13.240]  talking about down there because I know we have a station in that area but the
[03:12:13.240 --> 03:12:17.520]  point is that guy he would always say oh you got calves dying you got you know
[03:12:17.520 --> 03:12:19.880]  this and that happening you need to put them on this mineral that mineral you
[03:12:19.880 --> 03:12:22.960]  to give them this and that I mean he knew that he you know he was one of the
[03:12:22.960 --> 03:12:27.080]  top of his class at A&M I mean that's known well yes in the animal industry
[03:12:27.080 --> 03:12:31.680]  it is now here's here's why I did it I had what would be called Tourette syndrome
[03:12:31.680 --> 03:12:35.080]  today when I was four years old I was you know kind of blinking my eyes and
[03:12:35.080 --> 03:12:39.240]  getting facial cramps and I would get to tetany and fall over and my friends all
[03:12:39.240 --> 03:12:43.720]  said I was possessed and got worse every year by the time I was nine years old
[03:12:43.720 --> 03:12:47.360]  was really bad so my mom took me to an eye doctor and the eye doctor says look
[03:12:47.360 --> 03:12:51.560]  can't find anything wrong with the kid but he has long eyelashes and I think
[03:12:51.560 --> 03:12:54.400]  they're hitting his glasses curling back and tickling his eyeballs that's what's
[03:12:54.400 --> 03:12:58.400]  happening here not only nine years old Alex I said nah that's not right that
[03:12:58.400 --> 03:13:01.480]  can't be right so I said what do you want me to do so the doctor says well
[03:13:01.480 --> 03:13:04.560]  why don't you just take this Maybelline eyelash brush and retrain your eyelashes
[03:13:04.560 --> 03:13:08.080]  now I'm playing sports right that was before don't ask don't tell they'd have
[03:13:08.080 --> 03:13:11.600]  ripped my arms off beat me to death with my arms right so I went to school the
[03:13:11.600 --> 03:13:17.200]  next day looked in a nurse's handbook on what causes things I couldn't find long
[03:13:17.200 --> 03:13:22.120]  eyelashes and eyelid twitches so I found cramps and said calcium deficiency so
[03:13:22.120 --> 03:13:25.760]  before the bus would pick me up in the morning to go to school I would have to
[03:13:25.760 --> 03:13:30.000]  feed these calves you're gonna sell in the auction and we'd make them a little
[03:13:30.000 --> 03:13:33.360]  fatter a little shinier we give these no no I actually have done that myself you
[03:13:33.360 --> 03:13:37.200]  know you buy brand new calves you got a bottle feed them and you can sell them
[03:13:37.200 --> 03:13:40.280]  yeah exactly well I was giving these alfalfa pellets and on the analysis
[03:13:40.280 --> 03:13:44.520]  tag and said calcium so when I came home that afternoon I went right to the
[03:13:44.520 --> 03:13:50.040]  barn started eating those calcium filled alfalfa pellets for the calves for
[03:13:50.040 --> 03:13:53.600]  breakfast I threw the Cheerios out to the chickens and I had the alfalfa pellets
[03:13:53.600 --> 03:13:57.800]  with milk for breakfast and so on by the third day my Tret syndrome was gone so
[03:13:57.800 --> 03:14:00.120]  when I was nine years old any of the doctors didn't know anything about
[03:14:00.120 --> 03:14:03.320]  nutrition you know sometimes that could have been your guardian angel telling you
[03:14:03.320 --> 03:14:07.960]  that too mm-hmm yeah well I think it was a divine appointment because no nine
[03:14:07.960 --> 03:14:11.360]  year old kids gonna figure that out by himself so I there had to be a greater
[03:14:11.360 --> 03:14:15.720]  hand involved I do believe that and I think that's why I give 300 free
[03:14:15.720 --> 03:14:19.080]  lectures a year because they figure if I was given that information that I'm
[03:14:19.080 --> 03:14:22.040]  supposed to be giving out so you started taking the animal vitamins and it was over
[03:14:22.040 --> 03:14:26.080]  yeah just like people with the microplasm discovered right off the bat they
[03:14:26.080 --> 03:14:30.120]  could go to the feed store get the cheap antibiotics boom they're cured nobody
[03:14:30.120 --> 03:14:34.480]  tell them that's right when you're talking about rheumatoid arthritis mad
[03:14:34.480 --> 03:14:38.320]  cow disease aka Kreuzfeld Jacobs disease and this is gonna be published as
[03:14:38.320 --> 03:14:42.760]  perfect timing because I have another book coming out next year and this can
[03:14:42.760 --> 03:14:45.520]  be a whole chapter in there about prions and mad cow disease because there's a
[03:14:45.520 --> 03:14:50.020]  principle involved here that's called Koch's postulates back in the day when
[03:14:50.020 --> 03:14:53.520]  past year in this van loon hope discovered that there were germs the germ
[03:14:53.520 --> 03:14:59.640]  theory days it would cause these diseases it wasn't spontaneous generation
[03:14:59.640 --> 03:15:05.140]  that everybody jumped in the doctors all jumped in as well these bacteria these
[03:15:05.140 --> 03:15:08.640]  bugs these germs cause everything and coke was a very smart man said no no no
[03:15:08.640 --> 03:15:12.480]  you got to be able to isolate the bug that you think's causing it grow it on
[03:15:12.480 --> 03:15:16.720]  artificial medium then inject it into a susceptible host get the disease isolated
[03:15:16.720 --> 03:15:19.760]  again regrow it on a susceptible medium if you get the same bug then you can say
[03:15:19.760 --> 03:15:23.280]  it caused it well with these prions they haven't done that they've they've
[03:15:23.280 --> 03:15:27.040]  tried it but they haven't ever that's why they say they haven't proved prions
[03:15:27.040 --> 03:15:30.240]  cause it that's right well I know it caused it because I got rid of the first
[03:15:30.240 --> 03:15:34.880]  case I ever gotten two months and again how do you reverse it well it's
[03:15:34.880 --> 03:15:38.880]  actually a mineral deficiency and it goes back to the first descriptions in
[03:15:38.880 --> 03:15:44.480]  sheep which is called a enzoatic a taxi and sheep when you look at sheep with
[03:15:44.480 --> 03:15:47.840]  enzoatic a taxi they kind of wobble around like a drunk sailor foam at the
[03:15:47.840 --> 03:15:51.960]  mouth kind of like a mad cow right and then the mad cows look like a sheep when
[03:15:51.960 --> 03:15:55.600]  you look at their brains it's the same disease so without even doing any lab
[03:15:55.600 --> 03:15:58.520]  and else is I just said well the lesions look the same if the changes in the
[03:15:58.520 --> 03:16:02.440]  brain look the same it's got to be the same so I've been looking for about 10
[03:16:02.440 --> 03:16:05.600]  years for somebody with Christal Jacobs disease which is the human version of
[03:16:05.600 --> 03:16:10.760]  mad cow disease and I just gave him the Alex pack and some extra minerals two
[03:16:10.760 --> 03:16:14.800]  months time has gone his doctor kicked him out of the hospice because he said
[03:16:14.800 --> 03:16:19.420]  he's not done have it anymore I know and you and again you cover all this you
[03:16:19.420 --> 03:16:22.680]  break it down we've got links to it we've got your books available at info
[03:16:22.680 --> 03:16:27.280]  or store.com it is just amazing that the system knows you need these building
[03:16:27.280 --> 03:16:30.960]  blocks but they want you to be sick so that they can then give you all the
[03:16:30.960 --> 03:16:36.400]  treatments to pay off their half million dollar student loans and look here's an
[03:16:36.400 --> 03:16:39.240]  example we did this a few months ago we're gonna do the whole hour here we're
[03:16:39.240 --> 03:16:42.240]  gonna do the whole hour whole hour we're doing it this is awesome having you
[03:16:42.240 --> 03:16:46.480]  here so we can take the calls but Dan Badon he's out there he's perfect to do
[03:16:46.480 --> 03:16:50.280]  this remember those articles out of the newspaper it was in Texas papers and
[03:16:50.280 --> 03:16:54.960]  some others that said when we show this like five times a month ago I remember
[03:16:54.960 --> 03:17:00.480]  the exact headline but it was you know something like take your flu shots and
[03:17:00.480 --> 03:17:06.120]  then it said that's a lie there's no side effects from fluke yeah it was like
[03:17:06.120 --> 03:17:10.080]  take your flu shots be a good neighbor print me that article and then we show
[03:17:10.080 --> 03:17:16.360]  the CDC's on site where it says brain damage death autoimmune disorders
[03:17:16.360 --> 03:17:21.240]  guion beret what's happening with the vaccines because here's my point the
[03:17:21.240 --> 03:17:28.000]  doctors know up until four years ago that it that the insert said don't give a
[03:17:28.000 --> 03:17:31.240]  pregnant woman any vaccines it can cause an autoimmune problem you know it's
[03:17:31.240 --> 03:17:34.640]  defects you have birth defects but I mean everyone knew that that was in the
[03:17:34.640 --> 03:17:38.400]  insert still is four years ago they started saying no pregnant women needed
[03:17:38.400 --> 03:17:42.720]  more it's like they want to just try to go all the way and just see what we'll
[03:17:42.720 --> 03:17:47.200]  put up with and everywhere flu shot flu shot flu shot meanwhile they're on the
[03:17:47.200 --> 03:17:52.240]  news in in parade magazine you name it everywhere saying there is no side effects
[03:17:52.240 --> 03:17:57.000]  it's a conspiracy theory don't believe the people and then meanwhile the CDC's
[03:17:57.000 --> 03:18:03.720]  got 24 pages of links to hundreds of pages each link how it'll kill you and
[03:18:03.720 --> 03:18:10.360]  then they've done big studies where the shots they're taking for the HPV are
[03:18:10.360 --> 03:18:14.480]  being found with this RNA and stuff in the brains of women dying taking it
[03:18:14.480 --> 03:18:19.040]  they're having autoimmune disorders and bleeding out of every orifice they
[03:18:19.040 --> 03:18:24.880]  died six years ago during the trials they still approved it I mean this is not
[03:18:24.880 --> 03:18:29.200]  just dumb down people doing this I mean they doctors know when they now say a
[03:18:29.200 --> 03:18:33.080]  woman needs shots more shots when you're pregnant they know full well they were
[03:18:33.080 --> 03:18:36.680]  taught in medical school don't ever give a pregnant woman a shot so so what's
[03:18:36.680 --> 03:18:41.740]  going on here what's happening well again the medical system has
[03:18:41.740 --> 03:18:45.360]  legislated themselves Alex into a monopoly they're the only monopoly
[03:18:45.360 --> 03:18:50.600]  there's legal in America medical system they've killed off all their competition
[03:18:50.600 --> 03:18:55.520]  legislatively skip the break guys go ahead and everybody who is not an MD is
[03:18:55.520 --> 03:18:59.780]  a quack according to the MDs and the laws they've gotten into place now if
[03:18:59.780 --> 03:19:02.680]  Chinese traditional medicine has been around for 10,000 years before the
[03:19:02.680 --> 03:19:06.440]  Egyptians and medical doctors say these guys are quacks well the Chinese don't
[03:19:06.440 --> 03:19:09.720]  have any health care problems like we have right maybe they're still using
[03:19:09.720 --> 03:19:12.200]  their herbs and acupuncture and all that kind of stuff and they're in the
[03:19:12.200 --> 03:19:17.600]  middle of a toxic waste dump exactly they live longer than us now and their
[03:19:17.600 --> 03:19:22.280]  rivers catch on fire routinely exactly and so their medical system works very
[03:19:22.280 --> 03:19:26.120]  nicely thank you with these quacks that they've been using for 10,000 years and
[03:19:26.120 --> 03:19:30.960]  the medical system and you know the name Benjamin Rush yes okay Benjamin Rush
[03:19:30.960 --> 03:19:34.760]  of course was George Washington's personal military physician killed him
[03:19:34.760 --> 03:19:41.040]  yeah he was the first let's see who's the first US surgeon general and also first
[03:19:41.040 --> 03:19:46.800]  psychiatrist first psychiatrist okay and he also was a signer of the
[03:19:46.800 --> 03:19:51.960]  Declaration of Independence and he actually sent Jefferson a note which
[03:19:51.960 --> 03:19:57.240]  he used my presentation and this was for insertion into the Constitution when
[03:19:57.240 --> 03:19:59.520]  they're talking about the First Amendment and freedom of speech and
[03:19:59.520 --> 03:20:02.320]  freedom of religion he said we also need to put in their freedom of what
[03:20:02.320 --> 03:20:06.520]  medical type of doctor you want to use and if you don't there's gonna be one
[03:20:06.520 --> 03:20:10.000]  class of men is I'm quoting him yeah he was a good guy that he won the
[03:20:10.000 --> 03:20:17.440]  killed he didn't okay oh that's right rush is a good guy I'm going for memory and so he said the the
[03:20:17.920 --> 03:20:21.840]  if we don't if we don't put this in the Constitution that people have the right
[03:20:21.840 --> 03:20:25.600]  to choose what doctor they want one group of doctors is gonna take over and
[03:20:25.600 --> 03:20:30.200]  it's gonna be the Bastille of America no I remember actually reading that my
[03:20:30.200 --> 03:20:33.400]  memories not coming back on that we should report on that yeah and that's
[03:20:33.400 --> 03:20:38.360]  worth the whole day because this guy was great and his worst nightmares from
[03:20:38.360 --> 03:20:43.040]  300 years ago are coming true now because the medical system is essentially
[03:20:43.040 --> 03:20:49.320]  is like 20 25% of our GDP okay well let's go over it all then I mean why are
[03:20:49.320 --> 03:20:53.840]  we the sickest the fattest the dumbest now from the strongest the longest live
[03:20:53.840 --> 03:20:57.560]  what what's happened to us and where is it going before we go to calls okay well
[03:20:57.560 --> 03:21:02.560]  the reason is Alex that we've gone to drugs instead of nutrition medical
[03:21:02.560 --> 03:21:06.480]  doctors don't get 30 minutes of nutrition 14 years of medical school it
[03:21:06.480 --> 03:21:09.720]  should be a felony for a medical doctor to say anything about nutrition I'll
[03:21:09.720 --> 03:21:13.480]  give you two examples the worst example I can think I was Alzheimer's disease
[03:21:13.480 --> 03:21:19.560]  which is a physician-caused disease the 75% of your brain weight is mildness
[03:21:19.560 --> 03:21:23.720]  is insulation material in the brain when it goes away the naked nerve fibers all
[03:21:23.720 --> 03:21:26.120]  tangle up short circuit you get Alzheimer's disease that's the short
[03:21:26.120 --> 03:21:30.120]  version what else our disease is with this my limit makes up 75% of your
[03:21:30.120 --> 03:21:33.080]  brain weight is a hundred percent cholesterol so you're going to stand
[03:21:33.080 --> 03:21:38.680]  drug delivery cholesterol eating egg white omelets and you're eating things
[03:21:38.680 --> 03:21:41.400]  like eight beaters eating boneless skinless chicken breast you're eating
[03:21:41.400 --> 03:21:45.240]  tofu instead of red meat you're avoiding butter and dairy products and you're
[03:21:45.240 --> 03:21:51.520]  eating oils like canola oil that kind of stuff your brain goes away and so
[03:21:51.520 --> 03:21:56.000]  they've created this terrible dementia that didn't exist 40 years ago and we
[03:21:56.000 --> 03:21:59.960]  could pull up right now on screen yo studies brain volume getting smaller
[03:21:59.960 --> 03:22:04.440]  IQs lowering the brains are shriveling yeah exactly because they're lacking
[03:22:04.440 --> 03:22:08.120]  cholesterol and the system knows that they say don't have salt don't have fat
[03:22:08.120 --> 03:22:11.600]  but meanwhile they push all these hydrogenated fats which are the
[03:22:11.600 --> 03:22:17.240]  artificial ones right it was margin essentially and one of the things I
[03:22:17.240 --> 03:22:22.960]  show in my presentation Alex is our billionaires today March of 2011 I mean
[03:22:22.960 --> 03:22:27.360]  last year these billionaires can afford the most expensive doctors most
[03:22:27.360 --> 03:22:32.760]  expensive drugs and healthcare systems of insurance they can build gates as a
[03:22:32.760 --> 03:22:36.080]  75,000 square foot home because you got an indoor pool he's got an indoor track
[03:22:36.080 --> 03:22:39.040]  he's got a tennis court in his house all that kind of stuff they should be the
[03:22:39.040 --> 03:22:41.720]  healthiest guys on earth but billionaires don't live to be a hundred
[03:22:41.720 --> 03:22:44.560]  there's never one been living to be a hundred their average lifespan is only
[03:22:44.560 --> 03:22:49.280]  78 and the people who live the longest are illiterate people that don't go to
[03:22:49.280 --> 03:22:54.240]  kindergarten we have one who died in December of 2008 this guy's name is
[03:22:54.240 --> 03:22:59.320]  George Francis he died at 112 he's the oldest man in America and illiterate and
[03:22:59.320 --> 03:23:04.760]  this guy when they asked his daughter what'd your daddy do to live be 112 she
[03:23:04.760 --> 03:23:10.680]  said he ate lard eggs and dairy products I was gonna stop right there I'm not
[03:23:10.680 --> 03:23:15.040]  gonna use any names but actually now a prominent ranching family here in Austin
[03:23:15.040 --> 03:23:21.880]  Texas and the and the grandpa I think he died at 103 and and that's all he ate
[03:23:21.880 --> 03:23:27.840]  was eggs and giant pounds of bacon well I'm not big on the bacon but I like to
[03:23:27.840 --> 03:23:30.480]  eat well I've known but I'm not even saying that's good but it was like the
[03:23:30.480 --> 03:23:35.280]  joke was he eats Bluebell ice cream he eats the giant things of bacon and
[03:23:35.280 --> 03:23:42.040]  steaks well Bluebell ice cream Alex is an essential nutrient I just drove
[03:23:42.040 --> 03:23:45.640]  through Britain this weekend and to get out of here for F1 I was gone one day
[03:23:45.640 --> 03:23:52.240]  oh yeah you like Bluebell how's your favorite flavor vanilla I just love
[03:23:52.240 --> 03:23:57.440]  vanilla yeah I like the dirt Dutch chocolate but I stay away from it you
[03:23:57.440 --> 03:24:00.480]  need to come out with a beyond Tangierine flavor of Bluebell well we
[03:24:00.480 --> 03:24:04.520]  did we actually that's a good idea we could do that we'll contact them that's
[03:24:04.520 --> 03:24:10.440]  a good idea fruit punch Bluebell well there you go but we actually want people
[03:24:10.440 --> 03:24:14.200]  to get on that Alex pack because we need these 90s and this is why we're so
[03:24:14.200 --> 03:24:20.000]  sick you can't name me a disease is not caused by a nutritional deficiency okay
[03:24:20.000 --> 03:24:25.760]  that's that's very scary else our disease other other dementias course
[03:24:25.760 --> 03:24:30.640]  cough syndrome vascular dementia hyperactivity disorder oh my goodness
[03:24:30.640 --> 03:24:34.000]  back when I was a kid there's no such thing as hyperactivity or ADD I've
[03:24:34.000 --> 03:24:38.280]  seen TV shows the kids ADD and they're interviewing the kid and he has like
[03:24:38.280 --> 03:24:43.560]  jolly rancher bag and a Coca-Cola you're giving him a stimulant on the kids
[03:24:43.560 --> 03:24:46.680]  sitting with giant black circles around his eyes and they're gonna put them on
[03:24:46.680 --> 03:24:51.520]  anti-psychotics hmm well I take those kids and in two weeks time they're
[03:24:51.520 --> 03:24:54.600]  perfectly normal you just get them off the sugar get them off of gluten you
[03:24:54.600 --> 03:24:59.440]  make them eat four eggs a day you get them on the put in Bluebell ice cream
[03:24:59.440 --> 03:25:03.840]  right put the eggs in there put the eggs on top of it and then you get them on
[03:25:03.840 --> 03:25:07.800]  the Alex pack appropriate for the body weight it all goes away but they got to
[03:25:07.800 --> 03:25:10.400]  stay away from sugar and they got to stay away from gluten no we brought
[03:25:10.400 --> 03:25:13.720]  the right notes and give them the 90th sense of nutrients all that autism all
[03:25:13.720 --> 03:25:18.720]  the ADD ADHD hyperactivity goes away and that's a profound statement but if you
[03:25:18.720 --> 03:25:21.200]  look in that book rare earth's been cures which I believe you have in your
[03:25:21.200 --> 03:25:25.680]  store yes rare earth's been cures I have pictures how I am you don't need to go to
[03:25:25.680 --> 03:25:31.240]  a child psychiatrist to diagnose it just get a coloring book and give them just a
[03:25:31.240 --> 03:25:35.360]  whole slew of colors and somebody with ADD or ADHD or autism they'll pick out
[03:25:35.360 --> 03:25:39.080]  the darkest colors they'll pick up black purple dark green and they won't stay in
[03:25:39.080 --> 03:25:42.200]  the lines they just scribble all over the page whereas somebody else another kid
[03:25:42.200 --> 03:25:45.720]  who doesn't have these problems they'll be impeccable about choosing the per
[03:25:45.720 --> 03:25:49.000]  perfect color for whatever the subject is and they'll stay within line they're
[03:25:49.000 --> 03:25:53.920]  very mess fastidious I stand in the lines was actually up in Canada a couple
[03:25:53.920 --> 03:25:58.120]  of weeks ago going to a private school to lecture a bunch of teachers up there
[03:25:58.120 --> 03:26:04.120]  and they had this hallway with all these kids colorings they were like second
[03:26:04.120 --> 03:26:08.120]  grade kids their colorings like you see in some of these breakfast houses during
[03:26:08.120 --> 03:26:11.240]  Thanksgiving and Easter and Christmas and Halloween they have all these color
[03:26:11.240 --> 03:26:14.760]  pictures they said oh that one's got autism that was got this this one's got
[03:26:14.760 --> 03:26:18.120]  autism they're all whispering that you got a hundred percent how did you know
[03:26:18.120 --> 03:26:22.360]  those kids had autism well look he just took black and red and dark purple and
[03:26:22.360 --> 03:26:25.920]  just not even staying in the lines he said that's typical of those kids
[03:26:25.920 --> 03:26:29.600]  everybody else stayed in the lines chose the right color that book rare earth's
[03:26:29.600 --> 03:26:33.160]  been occurs shows you how to diagnose those things yourself how to deal with it
[03:26:33.160 --> 03:26:37.840]  how to get rid of it and don't don't get these kids on riddling do not do that
[03:26:37.840 --> 03:26:42.920]  well they admit riddling actually shrinks the brain and expands the heart
[03:26:42.920 --> 03:26:46.600]  why is that well interferes with nutrients anytime you have the heart
[03:26:46.600 --> 03:26:51.920]  enlarge you're looking at deficiencies of thiamine congestive heart failure are
[03:26:51.920 --> 03:26:55.880]  cutting up the heart disease a deficiency of selenium so many of these drugs
[03:26:55.880 --> 03:27:04.480]  actually interfere with the metabolism of nutrients okay and so that's how you
[03:27:04.480 --> 03:27:09.120]  get these diseases as secondary to drugs for instance you take cortisone
[03:27:09.120 --> 03:27:13.600]  prednisone you're gonna get type 2 diabetes and arthritis it's just
[03:27:13.600 --> 03:27:20.280]  given why is diabetes you have the number here but 30% now they are
[03:27:20.280 --> 03:27:26.280]  estimating next 10 years 50% or higher and people can just type in 50% to have
[03:27:26.280 --> 03:27:30.360]  diabetes in 10 years and you'll pull up MSNBC you name it that guys just just do
[03:27:30.360 --> 03:27:35.360]  that so people can see we're tell them the truth I mean and they never talk
[03:27:35.360 --> 03:27:39.680]  about what's causing it it's always let's find a cure well we will see they're
[03:27:39.680 --> 03:27:44.200]  doing research and raising money that's an industry right we've known for 70
[03:27:44.200 --> 03:27:47.360]  years what causes type 2 diabetes and that's why I can make somebody next
[03:27:47.360 --> 03:27:51.680]  diabetic in two to 14 days I'll take great story just take two minutes or less
[03:27:51.680 --> 03:27:55.160]  there's a guy who owns the third largest medical laboratory in America he
[03:27:55.160 --> 03:27:59.080]  services 7,000 hospitals and hundreds of thousands of doctors offices every day
[03:27:59.080 --> 03:28:03.720]  his name is Jerry Murphy he said I could use his name and he had terrible
[03:28:03.720 --> 03:28:07.720]  diabetes brittle diabetes his blood sugar was like 300 with injectable insulin
[03:28:07.720 --> 03:28:12.160]  couldn't get it down his a1c hemoglobin was like 8.9 supposed to be below 5 and
[03:28:12.160 --> 03:28:16.040]  he had a mutual friend introduced us and this guy's very skeptical he's got three
[03:28:16.040 --> 03:28:20.160]  PhDs in medical chemistry that kind of thing and he says okay Walik he says

[03:33:54.280 --> 03:33:58.280]  being a good neighbor this is out of the Longview News Journal and a few weeks
[03:33:58.280 --> 03:34:00.920]  ago or a month ago I showed a whole bunch of articles saying the same thing
[03:34:00.920 --> 03:34:07.120]  and it goes on to say you know don't believe and there is no truth in the
[03:34:07.120 --> 03:34:10.680]  notion that vaccines will give you the flu I'm trying to find the part here
[03:34:10.680 --> 03:34:15.360]  where they said that there are no side effects don't let yourself be fooled by
[03:34:15.360 --> 03:34:22.280]  wild rumors there are absolutely no harm from getting a vaccination no harm and I
[03:34:22.280 --> 03:34:28.240]  showed this in article after article no harm from the vaccine and it goes on
[03:34:28.240 --> 03:34:33.720]  to say wild rumors now showing you right here here is the CDC thank you guys
[03:34:33.720 --> 03:34:40.720]  possible side effects from vaccines and you go through here and this is a
[03:34:40.720 --> 03:34:45.000]  synopsis that's well this time it printed 20 pages when it printed like 23
[03:34:45.000 --> 03:34:49.440]  last time and you go through here it has subsections that goes to whole other
[03:34:49.440 --> 03:34:54.560]  huge PDF files where it talks about mild problems and it goes through each major
[03:34:54.560 --> 03:34:59.120]  vaccine headaches upper respiratory infection stuffy nose sore throat
[03:34:59.120 --> 03:35:04.200]  abdominal pain coughing nausea diarrhea fever more serious problems blood in
[03:35:04.200 --> 03:35:08.480]  urine or stool pneumonia inflammation of stomach intestines you know here's
[03:35:08.480 --> 03:35:13.200]  another one I'll find one that says that death here they've got death they've got
[03:35:13.200 --> 03:35:20.440]  coma seizures non-stop crying high fever 105 that's moderate long-term seizures
[03:35:20.440 --> 03:35:26.800]  coma or lowered consciousness permanent brain damage this is these are just
[03:35:26.800 --> 03:35:31.560]  synonymous CDC here let me give you the exact website it's cdc.gov
[03:35:31.560 --> 03:35:38.360]  forward slash print dot do question mark URL equals HTTP colon forward slash
[03:35:38.360 --> 03:35:43.920]  forward slash www.cdc.gov forward slash vaccines forward slash back dash gen
[03:35:43.920 --> 03:35:48.400]  forward slash side dash effects dot htm I just keep going here I mean I'm just
[03:35:48.400 --> 03:35:52.880]  just death you know brain damage but but but you heard them though there's
[03:35:52.880 --> 03:35:57.440]  absolutely no nothing and don't let people give you rumors dr. Wallach
[03:35:57.440 --> 03:36:00.880]  what's going on in the vaccines we're gonna go to calls well first of all
[03:36:00.880 --> 03:36:05.320]  vaccines don't protect everybody's given to it might to some vaccines only
[03:36:05.320 --> 03:36:10.840]  protect 10% of the people so 90% get the risk but no protection and so another
[03:36:10.840 --> 03:36:15.320]  problem is with flu shots noxious immune system down to almost zero for about
[03:36:15.320 --> 03:36:18.080]  three months have to get the flu shots so everybody who gets a flu shot in the
[03:36:18.080 --> 03:36:21.000]  fall against the flu that's why the major studies that just came out of the
[03:36:21.000 --> 03:36:25.160]  canadian as you know can a canadian government found it doubled your chances
[03:36:25.160 --> 03:36:28.840]  of getting the flu that's correct this is a great thing to take man you I'm
[03:36:28.840 --> 03:36:33.800]  sorry go ahead you're right on top of it that's good stuff and the if you want
[03:36:33.800 --> 03:36:37.600]  if you insist on taking a flu shot if you want to get that 10% benefit do it
[03:36:37.600 --> 03:36:41.720]  in March then by July your immune systems coming back up and you might get
[03:36:41.720 --> 03:36:46.720]  some protection you might be one of those 10% to get the protection the time
[03:36:46.720 --> 03:36:51.680]  to get a flu shot is when there's 10,000 people dying an hour and you need to do
[03:36:51.680 --> 03:36:55.600]  something if there's a mega emergency but again you can't trust these crooks to
[03:36:55.600 --> 03:36:58.360]  put something in you because they've all been caught piggybacking things down
[03:36:58.360 --> 03:37:03.520]  that's right HIV is a good one oh tell us about that well how did that show up
[03:37:03.520 --> 03:37:06.640]  in all these countries at the same time always when they were giving all these
[03:37:06.640 --> 03:37:09.720]  hepatitis shots which they admit congressional testimony that nobody
[03:37:09.720 --> 03:37:14.960]  knows and who did they find they went to clinics and convince gay men who they
[03:37:14.960 --> 03:37:18.000]  were the biggest vector because they have hundreds of partners on average in
[03:37:18.000 --> 03:37:22.880]  New York and San Francisco in London in Paris to take the shot on purpose and
[03:37:22.880 --> 03:37:27.280]  then vector it out with their own inoculation into an area of the body
[03:37:27.280 --> 03:37:31.280]  not protected yeah well that's that's cold-blooded that's primary side of
[03:37:31.280 --> 03:37:38.120]  entry is rectum that's that is a serious wicked operation well that's social
[03:37:38.120 --> 03:37:43.480]  Darwinism you know about social Darwinism tell us about it oh social Darwinism is
[03:37:43.480 --> 03:37:47.120]  kind of the eugenics thing you make people perfect by killing off the
[03:37:47.120 --> 03:37:55.080]  imperfect ones there is I remember it was moon raker in 007 yes that's that's
[03:37:55.080 --> 03:37:59.920]  what got Lurch on 007 side but he says hey this guy he's killing off all the
[03:37:59.920 --> 03:38:03.200]  people who aren't perfect and the little gal's looking at him and she's he's
[03:38:03.200 --> 03:38:06.480]  looking at her and neither of us are perfect so we better go with 007 instead
[03:38:06.480 --> 03:38:13.440]  of the bad guy because back in the day of Darwin there's one of his cousins who
[03:38:13.440 --> 03:38:18.080]  came up with eugenics Galton there you go Galton and he was one of Darwin's
[03:38:18.080 --> 03:38:24.920]  cousins and he came up with the idea well gosh if there is a selective things
[03:38:24.920 --> 03:38:29.760]  going on out in nature that only the fit of survive why don't we make the people
[03:38:29.760 --> 03:38:33.160]  who are the smartest and most beautiful we'll make more of them and we'll kill
[03:38:33.160 --> 03:38:37.200]  off all the ugly ones we'll kill off all the sharp ones and this was it bled
[03:38:37.200 --> 03:38:39.840]  into the Second World War and that's where the Nazis were killing off
[03:38:39.840 --> 03:38:43.440]  everybody who weren't the tall good looking blonde Aryan guys and that's the
[03:38:43.440 --> 03:38:47.160]  problem is the modern medicine came out of eugenics and that's why it just can't
[03:38:47.160 --> 03:38:53.480]  stop I've seen the state of Texas say we put the minority kids 69% on drugs and
[03:38:53.480 --> 03:38:56.240]  taken from their families because they're bad and they have bad genes and
[03:38:56.240 --> 03:39:00.920]  the liberals all stand up to salute these are not liberals well Mengele you
[03:39:00.920 --> 03:39:04.280]  know that he was a Nazi doctor there why are these bad guys always megal
[03:39:04.280 --> 03:39:08.040]  doctors I don't know but yeah there's one to do all these evil experiments on
[03:39:08.040 --> 03:39:12.320]  people and to come up with these really weird ideas and poor Darwin's got to be
[03:39:12.320 --> 03:39:16.000]  rolling over in his grave because he never wanted to go there but they took
[03:39:16.000 --> 03:39:20.800]  it and they sort of twisted his oh yeah then I get emails going you're
[03:39:20.800 --> 03:39:25.600]  attacking Darwin and well we were not even part of that discussion social
[03:39:25.600 --> 03:39:28.640]  Darwinism is what we're talking about yeah well social Darwinism was
[03:39:28.640 --> 03:39:32.400]  something that came out long after he retired was it well sure and the
[03:39:32.400 --> 03:39:35.280]  robber barons picked it up because that was like well I'm killing you that
[03:39:35.280 --> 03:39:38.760]  me because I'm in charge it means it's my right to do it I'm helping the world
[03:39:38.760 --> 03:39:43.000]  killing you because we're gonna make the human population greater over over time
[03:39:43.000 --> 03:39:47.000]  but you notice eugenics isn't doing that well that was their goal but they
[03:39:47.000 --> 03:39:50.720]  they don't of course it's an evil evil we're gonna go to phone calls folks but
[03:39:50.720 --> 03:39:54.000]  Dr. Wallach you obviously don't listen to my show we we obsess over eugenics but

[03:41:15.520 --> 03:41:19.400]  wondering about the products it's it's been great also I just ordered your book
[03:41:19.400 --> 03:41:23.240]  dead doctors don't lie and I haven't been able to put it down I finished it in
[03:41:23.240 --> 03:41:27.440]  two days it's one of the greatest books ever read just really amazing story so
[03:41:27.440 --> 03:41:30.200]  the first thing I wanted to ask the doctor Wallach was have you ever thought
[03:41:30.200 --> 03:41:34.320]  about writing a second book picking up where you left off and second for Alex
[03:41:34.320 --> 03:41:37.720]  I don't know if you heard about this up here in Washington some farmers got
[03:41:37.720 --> 03:41:41.640]  together with the Washington Farm Bureau and they wrote up a bunch of policy to
[03:41:41.640 --> 03:41:45.920]  block federal drones and agenda 21 yes I did I know here's what's happening
[03:41:45.920 --> 03:41:50.120]  everybody's fighting in all directions and I've noticed with the globalist if
[03:41:50.120 --> 03:41:52.840]  you just go out and confront them and fight them like you've done winning so
[03:41:52.840 --> 03:41:58.120]  many times there it's like the great Oz it's all a projection then when we all
[03:41:58.120 --> 03:42:03.200]  start attacking we're gonna win because they can only do big large frontal
[03:42:03.200 --> 03:42:07.040]  assaults they can't handle a whole bunch of us like the lila Paulies tying them
[03:42:07.040 --> 03:42:13.080]  down yeah well I I broke that story on examiner.com so if anyone wants to check
[03:42:13.080 --> 03:42:17.080]  it out Washington farmers block federal drones and agenda 21 it's a pretty cool
[03:42:17.080 --> 03:42:20.720]  story very exciting yes we're aware of that thank you so much your question for
[03:42:20.720 --> 03:42:25.720]  Dr. Wallach was yeah I have another book coming out early next year it's called
[03:42:25.720 --> 03:42:30.880]  epigenetics the death of the genetic theory of disease transmission because
[03:42:30.880 --> 03:42:33.240]  all these diseases are not genetic they're actually just nutritional
[03:42:33.240 --> 03:42:38.200]  deficiencies and it picks up exactly where dead doctors don't lie let off and
[03:42:38.200 --> 03:42:42.360]  so thank you and we carry that book at mfoldwarstore.com I should add. Let's go
[03:42:42.360 --> 03:42:48.240]  to Ray in Oregon Ray you're on the air go ahead
[03:42:48.240 --> 03:42:54.280]  oh Ryan I can't even read now go ahead Ryan yeah I want to thank you for taking
[03:42:54.280 --> 03:42:58.880]  my phone call I'm a first-time caller just started listening a couple months
[03:42:58.880 --> 03:43:05.120]  ago but I just been slowly researching on good health all that and I came across
[03:43:05.120 --> 03:43:10.360]  that tangerine and I haven't been able to try yet but my question is have you
[03:43:10.360 --> 03:43:16.960]  heard of the budwick diet and I know you're you've advertised to the water
[03:43:16.960 --> 03:43:22.560]  purification machines and what about the Cajun water and Cajun water yeah go
[03:43:22.560 --> 03:43:27.040]  ahead yeah you know Cajun water is a structured water we have one is called
[03:43:27.040 --> 03:43:31.760]  360 we have our own structured water and so we like structured waters and
[03:43:31.760 --> 03:43:35.640]  alkaline waters we just don't like people to drink them during meals because they
[03:43:35.640 --> 03:43:38.920]  do neutralize stomach acid they're gonna set you up for some allergies and things
[03:43:38.920 --> 03:43:44.480]  like that so I like to drink our structured water and alkaline water at
[03:43:44.480 --> 03:43:48.040]  least a half hour before meals half hour after meals before you go to bed when
[03:43:48.040 --> 03:43:52.840]  you wake up in the morning that's the way to take it don't drink it as a drink
[03:43:52.840 --> 03:43:56.360]  with meals because it will neutralize your stomach acid well that's like they
[03:43:56.360 --> 03:44:03.360]  talk about distilled water is a great diuretic it's a great way to actually
[03:44:03.360 --> 03:44:06.800]  key light according to what I've read from different medical journals but if
[03:44:06.800 --> 03:44:09.680]  that's all you're getting it's gonna flush everything out it's good to have a
[03:44:09.680 --> 03:44:12.800]  mixture right well there's two things you can do number one if you're gonna
[03:44:12.800 --> 03:44:18.320]  drink distilled water you have to take it again a half hour before half hour
[03:44:18.320 --> 03:44:21.680]  after meals don't take it with supplements because the still waters a
[03:44:21.680 --> 03:44:25.720]  hungry water will actually pull minerals out of your body and the other thing you
[03:44:25.720 --> 03:44:29.200]  can do if you make your own distilled water you're buying distilled water put
[03:44:29.200 --> 03:44:32.000]  one ounce or just plain plant minerals in there just put an ounce of plant
[03:44:32.000 --> 03:44:37.600]  minerals per gallon and that makes it nice exactly exactly so it has a lot of
[03:44:37.600 --> 03:44:42.400]  benefits to pull the bad stuff out that'll also pull the good stuff and you
[03:44:42.400 --> 03:44:45.000]  put the plant minerals in there then you don't have to worry about pulling all
[03:44:45.000 --> 03:44:48.800]  right thank you caller Donna in New Hampshire on the air with Dr. Wallet go
[03:44:48.800 --> 03:44:54.640]  ahead thank you for taking my call and I've been doing on the Alex pack for
[03:44:54.640 --> 03:45:00.760]  well over six months the only problem that I'm having is with the EFA's is
[03:45:00.760 --> 03:45:06.240]  there anything that I can substitute because it seems like with my husband
[03:45:06.240 --> 03:45:12.320]  I my husband mainly has gout and the fish oils just make him go into
[03:45:12.320 --> 03:45:17.560]  excruciating pain and I also have well let me answer one question at a time dear
[03:45:17.560 --> 03:45:23.040]  okay so yeah when people are have gout they're gonna be sensitive to fish and
[03:45:23.040 --> 03:45:27.240]  fish oils and so forth and that will aggravate symptoms so what you want to
[03:45:27.240 --> 03:45:31.240]  do we have one that's called woman's Omega woman's Omega is made from evening
[03:45:31.240 --> 03:45:34.840]  primrose all it's just a plant that has nothing to do with any now that's in the
[03:45:34.840 --> 03:45:38.880]  catalog at info ourselves calm it's called woman's Omega and he'll be fine so
[03:45:38.880 --> 03:45:42.800]  you just have to make your Alex pack separately in other words and also you
[03:45:42.800 --> 03:45:46.720]  want to keep him away from the Oscar FX plus which does have shellfish in it I
[03:45:46.720 --> 03:45:50.600]  would get we call Cal Toddy comes in a quart bottle like the Oscar X plus it
[03:45:50.600 --> 03:45:54.640]  has everything in it except for the shellfish be the same dosage call Cal
[03:45:54.640 --> 03:45:59.640]  Toddy like calcium tie like a hot Toddy and then you would do the beyond tan
[03:45:59.640 --> 03:46:04.560]  tangerine and do the woman's Omega and that'll give him everything does that
[03:46:04.560 --> 03:46:08.560]  make sense some people just can't eat fish or anything fish yep well you can't
[03:46:08.560 --> 03:46:13.280]  yeah especially so it's good to get that in fact my wife actually takes the the
[03:46:13.280 --> 03:46:19.040]  primrose one and wow what is it about that though or is it a imaginary because
[03:46:19.040 --> 03:46:26.120]  it seems like when I take it the the the primrose it I tend to get really like
[03:46:26.120 --> 03:46:31.400]  it has like an amphetamine effect well the primrose oil and actually all
[03:46:31.400 --> 03:46:38.600]  omega-3's actually affect blood sugar levels they they help your pancreas keep
[03:46:38.600 --> 03:46:42.200]  your blood sugars low I mean I've actually taken it before and I don't
[03:46:42.200 --> 03:46:46.720]  like speeding and I didn't know that so it can do that oh yeah because it messes
[03:46:46.720 --> 03:46:52.280]  around with your blood sugar and these but the fish oil doesn't do it why is it
[03:46:52.280 --> 03:46:58.400]  the primrose well the primrose all is a greater percentage of omega-3's than the
[03:46:58.400 --> 03:47:01.760]  fish oils so higher percentage is more than the omega-3's doing it now here's
[03:47:01.760 --> 03:47:05.480]  well that's the thing this stuff's like drugs I mean it's not I don't mean bad
[03:47:05.480 --> 03:47:08.960]  drugs I mean it really has an effect on you oh yeah no that's the nutrition does
[03:47:08.960 --> 03:47:15.960]  Alex is very dynamic it makes everything work the thing about gout is your liver
[03:47:15.960 --> 03:47:20.080]  is not able to break down uric acid into the separate carbon units and so you
[03:47:20.080 --> 03:47:23.400]  got to make the liver happy too if your husband has gout in addition to giving
[03:47:23.400 --> 03:47:28.400]  him the caltadi to be on tan tan dream and the woman's omega I would also give
[03:47:28.400 --> 03:47:31.680]  him our selenium and our de-stress capsules that's gonna make his liver
[03:47:31.680 --> 03:47:35.080]  happy and he'll be able to break down the uric acid into little carbon units
[03:47:35.080 --> 03:47:38.600]  all right ma'am does that answer your question great question that's it that's
[03:47:38.600 --> 03:47:44.280]  perfect thank you so much very welcome yeah no I've quit taking because I don't
[03:47:44.280 --> 03:47:46.960]  know I just kind of take different things because I can't take all this stuff
[03:47:46.960 --> 03:47:50.040]  every day I've never been somebody taking vitamins and minerals and pills so I
[03:47:50.040 --> 03:47:54.840]  try to just okay today I'll take this primrose one and and then again and you
[03:47:54.840 --> 03:47:59.520]  know the next day I'll take your EFA because I'll be honest sometimes I burp
[03:47:59.520 --> 03:48:02.800]  I don't like the fish flavor but then I've tried other brands or even it's
[03:48:02.800 --> 03:48:08.160]  even worse I mean what is that well again with the fish it has other things in
[03:48:08.160 --> 03:48:11.400]  there it has fishy stuff in there it's got fish proteins that make that happen
[03:48:11.400 --> 03:48:17.040]  all the little bugs you're intestine like that they make gas and so when that
[03:48:17.040 --> 03:48:20.880]  happens we actually have what we call EFAs which are in a darker soft gel
[03:48:20.880 --> 03:48:24.760]  capsule is just made from flaxseed oil and borage oil yeah those don't do that
[03:48:24.760 --> 03:48:28.600]  yeah so I need to take the black ones yep okay got it got it I just mix it all
[03:48:28.600 --> 03:48:31.680]  up I'm just well that's why I just noticed when I take that primrose stuff
[03:48:31.680 --> 03:48:36.360]  look out man it's like I'm I won't take it I mean well when we go when we go a
[03:48:36.360 --> 03:48:43.280]  protest someplace let's both take it let's talk to Martha in Hawaii you're on
[03:48:43.280 --> 03:48:54.520]  the air go ahead hi aloha hello aloha my husband has Parkinson's and I have
[03:48:54.520 --> 03:49:03.280]  fibromyalgia we've been on your beyond tangerine we've been on the osteo FX we've
[03:49:03.280 --> 03:49:09.040]  been on the EFA and we've been on the enzymes also I've cut the wheat out of
[03:49:09.040 --> 03:49:16.520]  our diet and I'm taking as many eggs as possible but I want to know for the
[03:49:16.520 --> 03:49:22.240]  protein does it have to be beef only or can you eat pork in substitute of just
[03:49:22.240 --> 03:49:29.360]  eating the beef with the eggs okay well the eggs what is your husband way but
[03:49:29.360 --> 03:49:34.000]  just about 200 okay he should be eating 12 to 15 eggs a day they cannot be fried
[03:49:34.000 --> 03:49:37.920]  sunny side up or over easy they have to be the yolk has to be soft he's got to be
[03:49:37.920 --> 03:49:42.120]  soft poached or soft boiled like one minute eggs soft soft soft scrambled in
[03:49:42.120 --> 03:49:50.280]  butter not margarine oils and what do you weigh 155 okay then I would take six
[03:49:50.280 --> 03:49:55.440]  eight eggs a day okay yourself and the fibromyalgia you also need to add our
[03:49:55.440 --> 03:50:00.520]  selenium in the glucogel for fibromyalgia because it's it's it's a good thing
[03:50:00.520 --> 03:50:03.080]  that you're on the gluten-free diet let me ask you this how long have you been
[03:50:03.080 --> 03:50:09.240]  taking the longevity products oh for a while every once in a while I fall off
[03:50:09.240 --> 03:50:12.520]  because quite honestly I can't always afford them no no I understand but has it
[03:50:12.520 --> 03:50:18.720]  had a positive effect wonderful but I know the I feel the difference I know
[03:50:18.720 --> 03:50:22.960]  the effect and I can feel the difference from the eggs and the protein
[03:50:22.960 --> 03:50:27.080]  everybody says I'm crazy because you're eating all these eggs but when I'm on
[03:50:27.080 --> 03:50:32.080]  that diet I feel much better but I want to find can you take too much selenium
[03:50:32.080 --> 03:50:35.920]  well of course you can especially it's going 4,000 feet per second right but
[03:50:35.920 --> 03:50:42.520]  basically you can't afford it you'd have to buy 60 bottles a day it's you can yes
[03:50:42.520 --> 03:50:47.160]  take too much selenium but it's not practical you're not gonna do it what
[03:50:47.160 --> 03:50:51.280]  I'm taking in the tangerine isn't I'm getting enough oh yeah well I know I
[03:50:51.280 --> 03:50:54.360]  would take more I get our selenium and take two of those capsules twice a day

[03:54:54.280 --> 03:54:58.720]  saying I just can't do it anymore just can't give these prescriptions I started
[03:54:58.720 --> 03:55:04.600]  about oh 20 years ago I actually got a pharmacist in Palm Springs, California who
[03:55:04.600 --> 03:55:09.320]  refused to fill prescriptions for statin drugs because I convinced him what it was
[03:55:09.320 --> 03:55:13.720]  doing causing Alzheimer's disease rectal dysfunction adrenal exhaustion PMS

[03:56:17.360 --> 03:56:22.480]  movements nope okay better ask you another one did you have diarrhea did you
[03:56:22.480 --> 03:56:26.720]  have it the other way sometimes okay yeah you have a gluten intolerance you
[03:56:26.720 --> 03:56:31.800]  must get off a gluten what do you weigh 217 217 okay you have to get off of
[03:56:31.800 --> 03:56:35.440]  gluten no fried foods no processed meats for nitrates and nitrites because they
[03:56:35.440 --> 03:56:39.760]  actually use wheat is filler and things like pastrami and pepperoni and sausage
[03:56:39.760 --> 03:56:45.520]  and and so on so you got to give up those kind of processed meats again no oils no
[03:56:45.520 --> 03:56:48.840]  margins salad dressings cooking oils the canned fish it's fine they got to be
[03:56:48.840 --> 03:56:52.840]  packed in water not oil the supplement program you need two Alex packs per month
[03:56:52.840 --> 03:56:56.400]  two Alex packs per month you're gonna take a one ounce of the Ozfax plus a
[03:56:56.400 --> 03:56:59.880]  breakfast and dinner two scoops of the ontant tangerine neutral crystals of
[03:56:59.880 --> 03:57:03.600]  breakfast and dinner three of those if a plus is a breakfast and dinner and if you
[03:57:03.600 --> 03:57:07.200]  get off a gluten and do that to Alex packs a month you'll get rid of your
[03:57:07.200 --> 03:57:13.000]  asthma in two to four weeks what how is it causing the asthma okay asthma is
[03:57:13.000 --> 03:57:16.840]  caused by deficiency of omega-3 essential fatty acids they're required by
[03:57:16.840 --> 03:57:20.720]  the lungs as a raw material to make a hormone called prostaglandins the
[03:57:20.720 --> 03:57:25.240]  purpose of the plus prostaglandins is to keep the bronchi open you don't have
[03:57:25.240 --> 03:57:30.640]  prostaglandins your bronchi closing at asthma and so this is it works every
[03:57:30.640 --> 03:57:35.520]  time I mean I have to dealt with kids of some very famous people political people
[03:57:35.520 --> 03:57:41.640]  I mean theologians who are very TV evangelists and things their kids are
[03:57:41.640 --> 03:57:47.200]  like they're 11 years old they haven't had any success at treating them with
[03:57:47.200 --> 03:57:50.080]  medical approach in two weeks time they're cured I can use the cure word
[03:57:50.080 --> 03:57:54.600]  because it's cured okay nobody can find it it's gone because there's a hormone
[03:57:54.600 --> 03:57:58.640]  that requires this omega-3 as a raw material for your lungs to make this
[03:57:58.640 --> 03:58:03.800]  hormone keeps it open and we usually night say 90% of the time when you have
[03:58:03.800 --> 03:58:07.040]  asthma is because you have gluten intolerance and you cannot and the one
[03:58:07.040 --> 03:58:10.120]  percentage you're working in a toxic plant or something exactly all right
