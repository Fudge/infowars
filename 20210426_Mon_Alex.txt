[00:00.000 --> 00:19.800]  All right, I took off Saturday and Sunday at least about 90%, actually unplugged myself
[00:19.800 --> 00:25.760]  from the computer, spent more time with the family, and it just intensified my clarity
[00:25.760 --> 00:31.760]  about where we are and what we're facing as a species on this planet and the big transformation
[00:31.760 --> 00:42.240]  for the worse that is taking place. And here's the final equation. If we don't have a total
[00:42.240 --> 00:47.640]  awakening to the fact that we're under threat and we're under attack at the globalist building,
[00:47.640 --> 00:53.240]  what they call a post human world, then we don't have any shot at changing this or fixing
[00:53.240 --> 01:01.120]  this. And it's been the process of industrialization. It's been the process of modernization that
[01:01.120 --> 01:06.240]  has really turned us into these domesticated ignorant creatures that don't even know how
[01:06.240 --> 01:13.680]  to defend ourselves or take care of ourselves. And each generation going forward is less
[01:13.680 --> 01:21.280]  human. Now there is a rediscovery of our humanity taking place and you see the system countering
[01:21.280 --> 01:27.880]  that scientifically with censorship, with social control, with chemicals, with electromagnetics
[01:27.880 --> 01:35.880]  to suppress the normal human system to adapt and overcome instead of being trained to adapt
[01:35.880 --> 01:44.320]  to being slaves and adapt to being phased out. And that is the entire process that is
[01:44.320 --> 01:54.080]  taking place. I've gotten to the point where I can't watch a CNN piece or even a Bill
[01:54.080 --> 01:58.720]  Marr piece or any of these propaganda pieces because I see the writing that's involved
[01:58.720 --> 02:05.920]  in it and I see the multi-layered deceptions that are involved. The level of propaganda
[02:05.920 --> 02:16.240]  has gotten even more sophisticated and these are very skilled, very destructive people
[02:16.240 --> 02:24.920]  doing this to their own interest, even short term. And so this is real evil. This is real
[02:24.920 --> 02:42.280]  conscious destructive evil that is satanically influenced, inspired and all I can tell the
[02:42.280 --> 02:49.680]  general public is you better get ready because where they're taking us goes one place and
[02:49.680 --> 02:56.560]  that's mass war and mass death. And I can tell you right now that I hope people like
[02:56.560 --> 03:00.720]  Bolsonaro and Trump and others could try to turn this around and you've seen a big
[03:00.720 --> 03:04.840]  awakening and that's a good thing but things are going to get so bad ladies and gentlemen
[03:04.840 --> 03:12.480]  that I just, I'm just blown away personally because things are moving so quick. You know
[03:12.480 --> 03:17.200]  there's also a lot of positive things happening because there's always for every action and
[03:17.200 --> 03:28.320]  opposite and equal reaction. But I've really, I don't want to say transcended but I have
[03:28.320 --> 03:35.400]  risen above my enemies. I've always been disgusted by them. I've always disliked them but I haven't
[03:35.400 --> 03:40.280]  wanted to defeat them so that I could be the top dog and be above them in this pile of
[03:40.280 --> 03:46.080]  skulls they sit on top of. I mean I transcended them a long time ago. I guess the time I was
[03:46.080 --> 03:57.400]  born the time spirit entered my body but now I've really transcended them and I think what
[03:57.400 --> 04:05.160]  I'm saying is the answer is transcending these people. We have to really transcend the New
[04:05.160 --> 04:11.000]  World Order and still resist it and still say no to it but not even give it energy when
[04:11.000 --> 04:21.480]  we do it. These are like sad mad dogs with rabies foaming at the mouth out in the street
[04:21.480 --> 04:27.240]  and you know they're already done for and it's over for them so you need to just stay away
[04:27.240 --> 04:31.800]  from them and just try not to let them bite your children and I think that's really what
[04:31.800 --> 04:36.240]  it comes down to because if you look at the New World Order you look at mainstream media
[04:36.240 --> 04:42.760]  look at Hollywood these are desperately unhappy desperate people virtue signaling and spewing
[04:42.760 --> 04:49.760]  their propaganda hoping to find peace and absolution and completion because they serve
[04:49.760 --> 04:57.200]  the system that is the opposite of that discord and chaos and pain and agony and betrayal
[04:57.200 --> 05:07.360]  and aloneness and failure last week I had a caller to my radio slash TV transmission
[05:07.360 --> 05:08.760]  and he said to me he said Alex there's all these facts and all these numbers and vaccines
[05:08.760 --> 05:13.320]  being recalled and people dying from it and people getting sick how do I reach out to
[05:13.320 --> 05:18.520]  my friends and family and explain to them and to warn them about the danger and I said
[05:18.520 --> 05:23.480]  to him something very profound because it's so true trust your gut trust your spirit with
[05:23.480 --> 05:29.360]  the Bible tells us and I said ask those friends those family those neighbors do you feel good
[05:29.360 --> 05:34.760]  about this vaccine and his answer was no they don't feel good about it so go with your gut
[05:34.760 --> 05:39.600]  well let me ask you again how does your gut feel about getting storeable food how's your
[05:39.600 --> 05:43.240]  gut feel about getting out in the countryside how's your gut feel about getting guns and
[05:43.240 --> 05:47.320]  ammo to protect yourself well I know what your guts telling you we have the best storeable
[05:47.320 --> 05:53.320]  food the highest quality at the lowest prices you're going to find 10% off at m4store.com
[05:53.320 --> 05:59.760]  right now or per paradox.com go with your gut and find the info or info or store.com
[06:23.320 --> 06:42.160]  Ladies and gentlemen it is Monday April 26th the year is 2021 and I'm your host Alex Jones
[06:42.160 --> 06:49.200]  promising you that this already important informative I've on guard transmission is now going to
[06:49.200 --> 06:58.120]  go to the next level and I'm going to shake transmission up with more your calls more
[06:58.120 --> 07:05.520]  quick guess and more special reports and more live commercial free podcast you got my commitment
[07:05.520 --> 07:10.680]  that here in the home stretch of going into the next level that I will work even harder
[07:10.680 --> 07:16.680]  because things are moving very very quickly and it is essential and because I'm going
[07:16.680 --> 07:21.200]  to shake things up something I never do always come on the show and hit the big stories and
[07:21.200 --> 07:26.000]  die right into the breaking censored and suppressed information the systems fighting to make sure
[07:26.000 --> 07:29.920]  in your family and others don't get it and I usually just barely plug at the end of the
[07:29.920 --> 07:34.600]  hour but couple big things have happened a you need these products they're amazing and
[07:34.600 --> 07:39.400]  B if you don't buy them we won't be here and it's that simple we don't have the big corporate
[07:39.400 --> 07:43.120]  sponsors we don't have the sugar daddy's we don't have things like that we have people
[07:43.120 --> 07:51.120]  like you supporting us and without you supporting the broadcast we will not be here so please
[07:51.120 --> 07:56.360]  support our local radio stations and local TV stations tell them you appreciate it sponsor
[07:56.360 --> 08:01.720]  them make a donation to them I guarantee you this shows doing more in your local church
[08:01.720 --> 08:06.480]  to find abortion Satanism the new world order that mean I'm a preacher on some high horse
[08:06.480 --> 08:10.880]  just we're doing more to expose the Satanist and most these churches so you should support
[08:10.880 --> 08:18.440]  local stations and I can say how many stations take us from being on we broadcast at night
[08:18.440 --> 08:24.080]  to during the day because of your support so great job on that front but keeping this
[08:24.080 --> 08:29.240]  venue alive while they're shutting almost everybody else down is so critical because
[08:29.240 --> 08:33.360]  as things get more and more intense as the new world population program gets more out
[08:33.360 --> 08:39.080]  of the open people are looking for this truth now more than ever but it's being blocked
[08:39.080 --> 08:44.480]  on Twitter Facebook YouTube Google and hundreds of other platforms people need to go directly
[08:44.480 --> 08:50.960]  to band dot video and of course info wars dot com or slash show people are very hungry
[08:50.960 --> 08:55.360]  for that truth but but separately here's an example that illustrates what's happening
[08:55.360 --> 08:59.880]  with the covid lockdown of the last 14 months around the world because here in the US we're
[08:59.880 --> 09:05.920]  only locked down in the blue states and blue cities still but if one employee in your factory
[09:05.920 --> 09:10.400]  warehouse says they have covid they usually shut the whole thing down so most the US
[09:10.400 --> 09:16.840]  is still partially crippled and partially shut down in Europe in the UK they're still
[09:16.840 --> 09:22.200]  almost completely shut down tens of millions extra just a footnote have starved to death
[09:22.200 --> 09:31.320]  in the third world in Africa in India even in China in Latin America in areas of Asia
[09:31.320 --> 09:36.040]  and the Middle East we've got those numbers when people get malnutrition any virus will
[09:36.040 --> 09:42.680]  kill them and I said this a year ago I said when the massive numbers have increased starved
[09:42.680 --> 09:46.840]  to death because the global lockdown a lockdown in the first world stars people to death and
[09:46.840 --> 09:52.400]  kills them in the third world a collapse of the first world kills the third world a depression
[09:52.400 --> 09:56.560]  in the first world is a death sentence in the third world I said it probably 5000 times
[09:56.560 --> 10:02.120]  on air until listeners complained and now here you are they're starving to death in
[10:02.120 --> 10:10.160]  Africa they're starving to death in India and when they starve to death and die of malnutrition
[10:10.160 --> 10:14.600]  when you look at the Indians dying tens of thousands a week right now extra they all
[10:14.600 --> 10:20.920]  look like concentration camp victims and the common cold is killing them and then the media
[10:20.920 --> 10:27.560]  tells you that COVID-19 did it when India is starving to death now you can argue well
[10:27.560 --> 10:33.520]  there's a billion 300 million Indians there's too many of them well ladies and gentlemen
[10:33.520 --> 10:38.800]  they've always had outdoor cremations they've always had mass cremations for the poor that
[10:38.800 --> 10:42.320]  friends and family have gone to India there's documentaries about it CNN complains they
[10:42.320 --> 10:50.040]  should be able to burn their dead outside it's bad for carbon but now CNN shows the burning
[10:50.040 --> 10:54.320]  masses of people and says oh look for the first time ever they're burning people outside
[10:54.320 --> 10:58.800]  well I pulled a stack of articles and videos showing CNN two years ago complaining how
[10:58.800 --> 11:07.800]  they burn people and mass outside but are there more people dying in India yes of malnutrition
[11:07.800 --> 11:13.640]  in Venezuela it was a thousand five six years ago dying a day extra and it was 2000 last
[11:13.640 --> 11:20.920]  numbers that came out were estimated at 5000 people a week starved to death in Venezuela
[11:20.920 --> 11:25.800]  but the government passed a law that you can't call it starvation and you can't gather those
[11:25.800 --> 11:32.600]  numbers if you're a statistician or a doctor you'll be arrested and they don't even call
[11:32.600 --> 11:41.080]  it malnutrition so that's how they work ladies and gentlemen oh look the Indians are starving
[11:41.080 --> 11:46.680]  to death you can even find aid groups saying they're starving to death but by the time
[11:46.680 --> 11:52.320]  it hits CNN look there's mass graves are burning people outside that's how they get rid of
[11:52.320 --> 11:57.360]  people over there anybody that has any knowledge knows that but not the average CNN viewer so
[11:57.360 --> 12:02.800]  it's it's lie upon lie upon lie upon lie but let me get back to what I was talking about
[12:02.800 --> 12:07.880]  we haven't had bodies our ultimate turmeric formula in five almost six months it's 95
[12:07.880 --> 12:12.440]  per secret humanoid it's the strongest you're gonna find out there anywhere it is the best
[12:12.440 --> 12:15.920]  dollar it helps funder operation plus it's great for inflammation your immune system
[12:15.920 --> 12:22.120]  everything puts a win-win and finally about two months ago I said why is it available
[12:22.120 --> 12:29.640]  they said well we can't get bottle caps I said change the bottle that's all gone to with
[12:29.640 --> 12:34.560]  the breakdown I said buy us bottles no we were trying everything shut down I started
[12:34.560 --> 12:39.560]  making phone calls and well all these little companies that manufacture high-end supplements
[12:39.560 --> 12:43.480]  go out of business these big companies are buying them up and so we're having to go through
[12:43.480 --> 12:48.120]  and I'm not complaining I'm explaining when the first world collapses the third world
[12:48.120 --> 12:54.560]  dies look at bodies I said well then get whatever color cap they have available they go oh they
[12:54.560 --> 13:01.440]  got yellow ones but not enough I said put a white cap on it but that's an example right
[13:01.440 --> 13:10.360]  there of how in world war two they were running out of copper so they came out with steel
[13:10.360 --> 13:13.480]  pennies for a while remember well it's the same thing here's your body doesn't have
[13:13.480 --> 13:20.200]  a black cap it has a white cap but it's the same body's formula in fact we change manufacturers
[13:20.200 --> 13:24.560]  it's the same formula they wanted me to plug this but it's a long sheet I'm not gonna do
[13:24.560 --> 13:34.640]  it's even stronger curcuminoid now this is now curcuminoid crystals it's so strong so
[13:34.640 --> 13:41.240]  this is just amazing back in stock 50% off and it funds our operation and it's not cheap

[13:51.200 --> 13:56.120]  of tennis and sports she's like yeah I gotta take three or four horse pills of turmeric
[13:56.120 --> 14:00.320]  for it to work I said just just take mine about three years ago when it came out she
[14:00.320 --> 14:04.320]  goes oh my gosh one pill works better than three big ones so she said why this this this
[14:04.320 --> 14:09.400]  bottle it says more turmeric than you I go because technically we just call it turmeric
[14:09.400 --> 14:13.840]  but it's a turmeric extract and she takes it every day and loves it and has a lot less
[14:13.840 --> 14:18.920]  pain because of it so that's why it's so important 50% off back in stock and hopefully
[14:18.920 --> 14:22.240]  now it's back in stock this will help fund the operation this is a great product you

[15:46.680 --> 15:51.320]  price gone for a while but it hadn't been on sale in six months because we can't get
[15:51.320 --> 15:54.640]  it sold out completely now we don't even know we're going to get it because it's got a bunch
[15:54.640 --> 16:00.720]  of patented hard to get ingredients when you buy the high end ones the federal government
[16:00.720 --> 16:06.720]  commissioned secret radiation experiments on thousands of non consenting patients hundreds
[16:06.720 --> 16:13.160]  of hospitals in the U.S. injected healthy men women and children with uranium and plutonium
[16:13.160 --> 16:18.600]  at dosage levels ranging from non therapeutic to lethal killing many of the test subjects
[16:18.600 --> 16:23.720]  in game blueprint for global enslavement is one of the most important films ever made
[16:23.720 --> 16:27.480]  14 years ago we tracked and documented the boulderberg groups activities and they're
[16:27.480 --> 16:32.000]  planned for a great reset using the threat of a fake virus the film now is more important
[16:32.000 --> 16:35.580]  than ever when it's shot to number one on amazon last year they banned it we have it

[16:54.800 --> 17:02.920]  or store dot com again I don't like to lecture people I'm a very private person but because
[17:02.920 --> 17:06.840]  of the globalist their attack on humanity I've been forced the last 27 years to be
[17:06.840 --> 17:11.120]  a public figure and we've given the globalist one hell of a run for their money because
[17:11.120 --> 17:15.680]  of God and I know some of our listeners get mad when I talk about God all day but just
[17:15.680 --> 17:19.680]  give me a break the Satanism's out in the open I've always been a Christian but now
[17:19.680 --> 17:23.600]  the fact that it's a fight between good and evil is so clear and I get it while you've
[17:23.600 --> 17:28.680]  been turned off by big churches while you've been turned off by the corrupt priests class
[17:28.680 --> 17:33.280]  system and I get it me too believe me I'm one of them but it's that relationship with
[17:33.280 --> 17:39.520]  God and just God's universe that God created that is so essential and then God created
[17:39.520 --> 17:43.840]  the universe for us to have communion with God through and to have life and so that's
[17:43.840 --> 17:47.640]  what info wars is really all about so thank you all for your word of mouth thank you for
[17:47.640 --> 17:51.160]  spreading the word about info wars and thank you for supporting us to keep us on air by
[17:51.160 --> 17:55.520]  visiting info or store dot com because without your daily and weekly and monthly purchases

[18:02.320 --> 18:29.880]  listening to the alex jones show
[18:29.880 --> 18:57.120]  but I really think it's important to always reset and just pull back and look at who the
[18:57.120 --> 19:03.880]  global star what they stand for and where they're taking us before we look at all this breaking
[19:03.880 --> 19:11.400]  news Greg Reese on Friday filed a report that we barely even promoted or pushed we should
[19:11.400 --> 19:16.080]  probably post it back in the live feed area of info wars dot com today so people can share
[19:16.080 --> 19:25.720]  it it's the pedophile propagandist roots of netflix and it's got a million plus views
[19:25.720 --> 19:32.760]  right now and you know I knew this information I know a lot of you know this but your friends
[19:32.760 --> 19:36.280]  and family and neighbors probably don't know that Sigmund Freud were the modern fathers
[19:36.280 --> 19:43.520]  of psychology was a valid pedophile and that most of founders of modern psychology were
[19:43.520 --> 19:49.360]  pedophiles and they still are today I mean this is a group of pedophiles that's who they
[19:49.360 --> 19:56.360]  are and what they are and what they do they destroy innocence their psychic vampires and
[19:56.360 --> 20:00.520]  so that's why you see the sexualization of children all over netflix particularly but
[20:00.520 --> 20:05.640]  it's on the other channels as well that's the cult of ghouls were up against and the
[20:05.640 --> 20:08.880]  good news is the majority of americans believe that there's an elite running things that
[20:08.880 --> 20:18.960]  are pedophiles cube exaggerated it put dates on it to discredit it but doesn't mean that
[20:18.960 --> 20:23.480]  most of what q was saying was true it absolutely was true but they were just putting dates
[20:23.480 --> 20:28.360]  on it and discrediting it by exaggerating or or or or or misplacing it it's the only
[20:28.360 --> 20:38.120]  hope they've got to discredit it but that's okay if you followed the whole cute thing
[20:38.120 --> 20:42.560]  because you meant well people come in they say but Alex q exposed bohemian grove and
[20:42.560 --> 20:48.600]  the fellow reserve q exposed the pedophiles I'd be like no that was people 60 years ago
[20:48.600 --> 20:54.880]  and that was myself and Ted Gunderson oh you just want the credit q's getting I'm like
[20:54.880 --> 21:04.480]  no this is controlled opposition to discredit you you need to listen to me and now you see
[21:04.480 --> 21:09.680]  what's happened but the real stuff is all right there it's like on friday that guy's
[21:09.680 --> 21:14.920]  pulled from the stack for me thanks I showed you state department memorandum 200 and I
[21:14.920 --> 21:20.200]  showed you a bunch of other public documents of world leaders saying they want to kill
[21:20.200 --> 21:28.200]  you through vaccines that they claim or a cure but are really the disease and I showed
[21:28.200 --> 21:37.240]  you quotes of world leaders saying that and I showed you government documents I just want
[21:37.240 --> 21:45.840]  people to look at the proof and not some nebulous thing so that you have the facts to show people
[21:45.840 --> 21:50.000]  so that's the mindset of these individuals so here is Greg Reese's report it's at band
[21:50.000 --> 21:55.640]  dot video the left hand side and just imagine the truth lives there you go to band dot video
[21:55.640 --> 22:00.480]  or band this dot tv's another url takes the same place not as censored as band dot video
[22:00.480 --> 22:04.960]  band this dot tv isn't censored yet on facebook or twitter it will be soon so we'll have another
[22:04.960 --> 22:08.840]  url we share that gets around the censors you go to the left hand side there's three
[22:08.840 --> 22:12.720]  lines you click on the nav bar and you pull down all the different channels you'll see
[22:12.720 --> 22:29.040]  Greg Reese right there and you'll find his special reports you can share his latest one
[22:29.040 --> 22:42.360]  Sigmund Freud claimed his father molested all of his siblingsings
[22:42.360 --> 22:48.280]  and that children who reported sexual abuse by adults had either imagined or fantasized
[22:48.280 --> 22:54.560]  the experience. He believed that women were the problem with society and all their problems
[22:54.560 --> 23:03.760]  stemmed from not having a penis. Freud's grandson, Sir Clement Freud, has been accused of molesting
[23:03.760 --> 23:10.880]  multiple young girls and was suspected in the disappearance of Madeline McCann. Sigmund
[23:10.880 --> 23:16.600]  Freud's sister, Anna Freud, whom Freud claimed was regularly molested and abused by their
[23:16.600 --> 23:25.080]  perverted father, gave birth to Freud's nephew, Edward Bernays, the father of propaganda. Bernays
[23:25.080 --> 23:32.240]  took his family's work in psychology and used it to help governments and corporations manipulate
[23:32.240 --> 23:39.000]  the minds of the public. Hired by the American tobacco company, Bernays manipulated women into
[23:39.000 --> 23:45.880]  buying more cigarettes by convincing them that smoking was a form of feminist liberation. During
[23:45.880 --> 23:53.280]  this propaganda campaign, he dubbed cigarettes torches of freedom. Thanks to Bernays and his
[23:53.280 --> 24:00.720]  family's twisted legacy, social engineering became big business. Modern psychology was used to exploit
[24:00.720 --> 24:08.760]  mankind's mental weaknesses, nurture the public's lower desires, and turn people into mindless
[24:08.760 --> 24:16.800]  consumers. Is it any surprise then that the great nephew of Edward Bernays is none other than Mark
[24:16.800 --> 24:25.680]  Bernays Randolph, the co-founder and original CEO of Netflix? Does anyone really think this is a
[24:25.680 --> 24:32.560]  coincidence? Netflix has not only replaced network television as the premier home of pop culture,
[24:32.560 --> 24:39.520]  it is also continuing the degenerate depraved social engineering of the Bernays Freud legacy.
[24:39.520 --> 24:47.600]  In 13 reasons why, Netflix was accused of romanticizing suicide during a recent increase of
[24:47.600 --> 24:54.280]  teenage suicides. In The Devil Next Door, they were accused of rewriting history to deceive
[24:54.280 --> 25:01.440]  viewers into believing that Poland was responsible for establishing Nazi death camps. In the first
[25:01.440 --> 25:09.120]  temptation of Christ, Jesus Christ is depicted as a homosexual and a Texas grand jury indicted
[25:09.120 --> 25:17.720]  Netflix for depicting child sex in the movie Cuties. Netflix and Chill, the new preferred method
[25:17.720 --> 25:24.760]  for brainwashing the masses, brought to you by one of the most depraved degenerate families of
[25:24.760 --> 25:35.640]  the modern era. Turn it off and wake up. For Infowars.com, this is Greg Rees. Very important
[25:35.640 --> 25:44.680]  report at band.video and bandness.tv. And when you study Skinner and you study all these people,
[25:44.680 --> 25:54.800]  Kenzie, I mean, it is all humans are animals. They have no rights. We need to have sex with children.
[25:54.800 --> 26:00.080]  This is just a group of people that want to rule over others and engage in mass mind control. And a
[26:00.080 --> 26:07.640]  lot of them were later involved in MKUltra and other mind control operations. But as they got
[26:07.640 --> 26:12.840]  deeper into it, they found that it was backfiring on them. And so they decided to just drug out
[26:12.840 --> 26:17.200]  and poison the public. And then finally, that humanity needs to be completely eradicated and
[26:17.200 --> 26:21.720]  that they're going to be gods and merge with machines. And then that's what most of the big
[26:21.720 --> 26:27.760]  tech heads believe that these are insane megalomaniacs who are following a very, very dark
[26:27.760 --> 26:36.520]  spirit. Okay, we have some huge, every day they get more insane stories that came out Saturday,
[26:36.520 --> 26:42.160]  Sunday and today with the COVID hoax and the fraud. There is a real virus with the rollout,
[26:42.160 --> 26:47.360]  the response is all a fraud, but there's some hidden daggers in the dark that I want to break
[26:47.360 --> 26:52.280]  down for you as well coming up on the other side of this break. This is so important for your

[30:17.920 --> 30:22.520]  still on air at infowarst.com and Bandai video radio stations and TV stations across the country.
[30:22.520 --> 30:27.360]  And our film in game censored and taken offline by Amazon when it hit number one a few years ago
[30:27.360 --> 30:33.160]  is now available again. We have reprinted it high quality DVD in HD. It has a zero country code.

[30:37.400 --> 30:41.320]  make copies, give it to everyone you know, air local access TV, give it to your pastors,
[30:41.320 --> 30:45.000]  your police chiefs, your state reps, your prime ministers, whatever you do, warn the world.
[30:45.000 --> 30:50.440]  This film uses their own documents and statements 14 years ago to expose them. It's more important
[30:50.440 --> 30:55.880]  than ever available at infowarstore.com. That's infowarstore.com in game blueprint for global
[30:55.880 --> 31:04.360]  display. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[31:25.880 --> 31:41.720]  I remember. It's like 100 years ago. But I guess it was back in 2009. I made the film,
[31:41.720 --> 31:50.200]  the Obama deception. And in the film, I said, in the future, you'll only get meat once a month.
[31:50.200 --> 31:57.480]  Well, that was actually in the UN proposed documents. And that's what they proposed. And
[31:57.480 --> 32:02.120]  then they said, that's for adults. Within a generation, you'll get meat once a year on your
[32:02.120 --> 32:09.160]  birthday. And that's now taught officially in UK schools. And you say, well, it'll be a while till
[32:09.160 --> 32:14.680]  that gets here. Well, here it is, Michigan University study, Biden's climate plan. But
[32:14.680 --> 32:22.280]  for us Americans to reduce their red meat consumption by 90% mean they can only consume
[32:22.280 --> 32:29.400]  four pounds of red meat a year equivalent to one burger a month. We'll be talking about that
[32:32.040 --> 32:39.480]  coming up. People think we just say this stuff to sound shocking. It's a plan.
[32:39.480 --> 32:46.680]  And they know that there were the same amount roughly of other bovine, water buffalos,
[32:48.200 --> 32:52.920]  planes, buffalos and others all over the planet. There were even on the Serengeti more
[32:54.600 --> 32:59.560]  similar animals to cows, creating just as much methane gas, methane gas as part of our atmosphere.
[33:00.920 --> 33:05.720]  The plants, the humans, the animals, the bugs, the insects, the plankton, we create our atmosphere.
[33:05.720 --> 33:13.160]  But they tell us that a global food council will decide who gets food in the wind. So
[33:13.720 --> 33:17.000]  they just go ahead and starve the third world with a global lockdown that's still ongoing
[33:17.000 --> 33:21.480]  with the third world. Then organize them into giant hordes of people brainwashed
[33:21.480 --> 33:26.840]  against the West that didn't be brought here. But already for the decade and cartoons for children
[33:27.400 --> 33:33.160]  in public schools in Europe, now in Canada and Australia, they are teaching you'll get
[33:33.160 --> 33:39.560]  meat once a year. The very TV viewer, I just showed you the British government sponsored
[33:39.560 --> 33:44.440]  cartoon funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates, Rockefeller and UN Foundation.
[33:45.800 --> 33:49.400]  Notice Bill Gates is on the news now. He was at the big global Earth Day event last week.
[33:50.600 --> 33:54.920]  He addressed the world leaders and they said he was in charge and none of the world leaders wore
[33:54.920 --> 34:03.560]  masks, but Biden did, showing he's a good gimp, a good little cuck. And Gates said you will only
[34:03.560 --> 34:10.760]  get synthetic meat made out of bug protein. You can grow bugs in a warehouse. We're cows grown,
[34:10.760 --> 34:15.240]  but that's what they call it growing beef cattle. They were flying around in a helicopter over
[34:15.240 --> 34:20.040]  Texas or anywhere. There's beautiful farms and ranches, little farmhouses, big farmhouses,
[34:20.040 --> 34:26.360]  happy swimming pools, happy tractors, and happy little cows. You can fly up in Nebraska or Wyoming,
[34:26.360 --> 34:29.880]  you can fly in Illinois, they got cows. You can fly in Florida, they got cows.
[34:31.240 --> 34:34.040]  Go rent a helicopter, they're only a couple hundred bucks an hour for the smaller ones.
[34:34.920 --> 34:39.880]  And just go fly around and see it for yourself. But you see the news that shows them on a feed
[34:39.880 --> 34:45.880]  lot going look, they're held in captivity like chickens, no they're not. Maybe 3% of the beef
[34:45.880 --> 34:52.760]  that they call prime. When you pay them more, they fatten them up for about a month before
[34:52.760 --> 34:57.480]  they slaughter them at a feedlot. And they sit there and gorge and get fatter, just like they
[34:57.480 --> 35:03.960]  do that to geese to create different types of what is it, pate or I forget all the names of
[35:03.960 --> 35:09.640]  the slaughter livers up. But that's the ignorance, ladies and gentlemen, the cows are happy,
[35:09.640 --> 35:15.160]  they're out there, they produce calves and you sell a certain number a year to pay your property
[35:15.160 --> 35:20.520]  taxes. And they got the actuaries out that if you took beef production away from the U.S.,
[35:20.520 --> 35:25.400]  it would be the final nail in the coffin of American independent agriculture,
[35:26.680 --> 35:33.240]  which is Bill Gates' plan. And they're going ahead with regulations that will not even allow
[35:33.880 --> 35:38.280]  all the school lunch programs, all the other systems to buy beef. And then they go on to say
[35:38.280 --> 35:43.800]  there'll be carbon tax on poultry, there'll be carbon tax on fish, there's carbon taxes on
[35:43.800 --> 35:48.760]  everything. Oh, I said I'd get to that later. I'll get to that next hour. We're going to open
[35:48.760 --> 35:52.520]  the phones up throughout the transmission today. The Health Ranger joins us in the third hour with
[35:52.520 --> 35:59.880]  some huge news. You will eat synthetic meat, you will eat bugs, you will eat weeds,
[36:00.840 --> 36:05.000]  and you will drink sewage. These are all quotes from Bill Gates and Klaus Schwab.
[36:05.000 --> 36:10.920]  And if you put up with it, well, that's then what you get.
[36:14.840 --> 36:19.880]  You know, let me cover this now and then I'll cover the huge cover in this next segment.
[36:20.680 --> 36:28.200]  I was thinking this weekend about Prince Philip dying and Prince Philip talking about
[36:28.200 --> 36:35.880]  how he wants world government, how he wants world depopulation and the rest of it.
[36:36.680 --> 36:41.240]  And then everybody bows down to him, so in a way we deserve Prince Philip and Ted Turner
[36:41.240 --> 36:45.240]  and Bill Gates to behave like this because they're all in the same club. Oh, Gates met
[36:45.240 --> 36:47.720]  with the royal family quite a bit. I mean, they're behind a lot of it.
[36:50.040 --> 36:55.000]  And then the left attacks the royals. People go, oh, the royals must be good,
[36:55.000 --> 37:00.680]  the left's attacking them, and that basic reverse psychology works like a charm on people.
[37:03.160 --> 37:09.960]  But I digress, ladies and gentlemen, you see, they've got big palaces that a taxpayer paid for.
[37:09.960 --> 37:16.920]  They've got big yachts. They've got private yachts the size of
[37:16.920 --> 37:26.520]  major cruise lines. But the reason I bring up Queen Elizabeth and all the rest of these people,
[37:27.400 --> 37:36.280]  the Dutch royal family's probably even worse. The reason I raise them is they stand up for
[37:36.280 --> 37:41.480]  themselves. They wear royal regalia. They wear a crown. They tell you to address them as your
[37:41.480 --> 37:48.840]  highness. Well, our American system was about us kicking them out and saying we don't address
[37:48.840 --> 37:53.320]  people off titles. We address people off what they stand for and who they are and what they do,
[37:53.320 --> 37:57.560]  not what color they are, but the character of their deeds, the content of their deeds,
[37:58.440 --> 38:02.840]  how smart they are, how productive they are, how honest they are. And that produced the most
[38:02.840 --> 38:08.600]  wealth the world's ever seen. We were 5% of the population in 1955. We had half the world's wealth
[38:08.600 --> 38:13.640]  because we were strong and rugged individuals and upright compared to everybody else. And we
[38:13.640 --> 38:17.160]  didn't bow down to somebody because they were wearing a crown. We thought that was disgusting.
[38:18.120 --> 38:20.200]  We thought that somebody great, great, great, great, great, great, great,
[38:20.200 --> 38:20.200]  great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great,
[38:20.200 --> 38:23.000]  great great, great, great, great, great, great, great great, great, great, great,
[38:23.000 --> 38:26.040]  great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great,
[38:26.040 --> 38:30.200]  great, great, great, great, great, great grandfather, great, great, great, great,
[38:30.200 --> 38:37.000]  William the Conker. You know, Conker is something, in 1066, that we've got to bow down to is
[38:37.000 --> 38:41.640]  20 or 50 of whatever it is grandson.
[38:41.640 --> 38:42.960]  But see, we don't stand up for ourselves.
[38:42.960 --> 38:44.360]  I'll go ahead and kill those old people.
[38:44.360 --> 38:45.560]  I'll go ahead and kill those babies.
[38:45.560 --> 38:47.160]  Go ahead and euthanize those folks.
[38:47.160 --> 38:49.480]  Yeah, go ahead and treat me like I'm dirty.
[38:49.480 --> 38:50.480]  Make me wear a mask.
[38:50.480 --> 38:52.760]  I'll get ahead acting like a sheep.
[38:52.760 --> 38:54.000]  I'll obey the system.
[38:54.000 --> 38:55.680]  It likes me.
[38:55.680 --> 38:58.800]  And you're lower than a cow out there in that field that doesn't even know it's going to
[38:58.800 --> 39:02.000]  get slaughtered come sale time.
[39:02.000 --> 39:05.000]  It's going to get turned into hamburger meat.
[39:05.000 --> 39:07.480]  Oh, that old cow's already had about 10 calves.
[39:07.480 --> 39:08.480]  She get a little old.
[39:08.480 --> 39:11.640]  I'm going to go ahead and sell her off.
[39:11.640 --> 39:15.680]  And they go to an auction and they buy that cow's hamburger meat.
[39:15.680 --> 39:19.400]  But she gets a 10 year lifespan out there.
[39:19.400 --> 39:22.200]  Oh, it's the it's the little yearling.
[39:22.200 --> 39:26.120]  Or it's the three, four month old calf that gets all massaged and fed cream.
[39:26.120 --> 39:29.400]  It's going to be in a fine Italian restaurant as veal.
[39:29.400 --> 39:31.240]  And so we don't stand up for ourselves.
[39:31.240 --> 39:32.800]  We don't stand up for others.
[39:32.800 --> 39:38.600]  We think we get ahead by not standing up for other people and all we do is get rid of the
[39:38.600 --> 39:45.160]  social safety net, get rid of the social contract, all we do is get rid of the chivalry.
[39:45.160 --> 39:49.560]  And now we're wide open and there's nobody to stand up for us and nobody to stand up
[39:49.560 --> 39:54.000]  for them and the globalists have checkmate and have won.
[39:54.000 --> 39:56.480]  And part of that was how much wealth and power we had.
[39:56.480 --> 39:57.480]  We became decadent.
[39:57.480 --> 40:01.320]  We're the grandchildren of people that were more decadent than their grandparents and
[40:01.320 --> 40:02.720]  more decadent than their grandparents.
[40:02.720 --> 40:08.120]  And so we're soft and it's time for us to be slaughtered.
[40:08.120 --> 40:12.400]  I just want to point out that I understand some of the arguments about mass culling.
[40:12.400 --> 40:17.000]  I want to point out that Ted Turner and Prince Philip and Bill Gates for God's sakes are
[40:17.000 --> 40:20.720]  not the best specimens of us and this is not even true eugenics.
[40:20.720 --> 40:21.720]  And so I would respect them more.
[40:21.720 --> 40:24.920]  They'd all kill themselves first, but see, they're not going to do that.
[40:24.920 --> 40:27.400]  They want us to kill ourselves first wear a mask.
[40:27.400 --> 40:28.760]  Oh, you don't get meat anymore.
[40:28.760 --> 40:29.760]  Oh, you can't travel anymore.
[40:29.760 --> 40:33.840]  Oh, we're going to put this experimental shot in you and then you go, oh, it's safe.
[40:33.840 --> 40:36.960]  I'm going to do it when it's killing you.
[40:36.960 --> 40:38.400]  Start respecting yourselves.
[40:38.400 --> 40:43.960]  Instead, they're building a post human world to sabotage with the race and the sex and
[40:43.960 --> 40:49.920]  the men and women's sports and all of this admittedly Tabistock Institute CIA all out
[40:49.920 --> 40:50.920]  of England.
[40:50.920 --> 41:01.320]  See, I was set up by British intelligence to sabotage the United States, the globalists
[41:01.320 --> 41:02.320]  are purposely collapsing our world.
[41:02.320 --> 41:04.320]  They are creating insecurity, crime, war and famine.
[41:04.320 --> 41:08.960]  All of us should do everything we can to get prepared and get ready for ourselves and our
[41:08.960 --> 41:14.040]  family's sakes, but also our humanity and citizens stronghold.com is the best place

[41:58.560 --> 42:01.920]  Cognitive dissonance is a major issue amongst the left.

[42:06.240 --> 42:10.960]  If you have a family member suffering from this degenerative mental condition, buy them
[42:10.960 --> 42:15.480]  a bottle of ultimate fish oil from Infowarsstore.com.
[42:15.480 --> 42:20.280]  Studies have suggested that fish oils and fish oil supplementation can slightly lower
[42:20.280 --> 42:26.000]  blood pressure, decrease triglyceride levels, decrease the growth rate of plaque and provide
[42:26.000 --> 42:32.000]  a soothing reduction in inflammatory responses in joints and the digestive system.
[42:32.000 --> 42:38.640]  Recent studies have suggested that high EPA and DHA fish oil can stimulate immune function
[42:38.640 --> 42:43.240]  by increasing the concentration and activity of immune cells.
[42:43.240 --> 42:49.200]  It worked for my family and now I can have a logical and calm discussion about actual
[42:49.200 --> 42:51.840]  facts that pertain to reality.

[44:07.400 --> 44:11.000]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[44:11.000 --> 44:13.120]  It's known as the Builder-Bird.
[44:13.120 --> 44:16.240]  Could their objective be world domination?
[44:16.240 --> 44:20.040]  For thousands of years, their Dark Order grew.
[44:20.040 --> 44:26.000]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80%
[44:26.000 --> 44:28.200]  of humanity is at hand.
[44:28.200 --> 44:30.840]  The globalist fear this film made 14 years ago.
[44:30.840 --> 44:33.040]  It is the blueprint for their plan to figure out the world.
[44:33.040 --> 44:34.520]  It is the blueprint for the great reset.
[44:34.520 --> 44:35.520]  It is in-game.
[44:35.520 --> 44:39.720]  Blueprint for global enslavement available right now at Infowarsstore.com with a zero
[44:39.720 --> 44:42.720]  country code meaning you can make copies of it anywhere in the world.
[44:42.720 --> 44:46.920]  I strongly suggest you get the film in-game at Infowarsstore.com.
[44:46.920 --> 44:51.280]  I strongly suggest you make copies and share it and if you take that action, I demand you
[44:51.280 --> 44:54.720]  tell others you've given a copy too that they make copies and share it as well.
[44:54.720 --> 45:02.960]  It will trigger distribution by proxy meaning we the people can't on the stopped.
[45:02.960 --> 45:22.640]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[45:22.640 --> 45:28.680]  The essence of tyranny is feudalism, keeping people at a subsistence starvation level.
[45:28.680 --> 45:34.960]  I'm going to cover it for the next hour and then give the phone number out.
[45:34.960 --> 45:39.720]  And where we're going, where our trajectory is, you're in the first world versus the third
[45:39.720 --> 45:45.280]  world because you're going to wake up and you'll realize you're in the third world and
[45:45.280 --> 45:49.920]  you are in the crosshairs as well and then you might want to just break the spell.
[45:49.920 --> 45:54.040]  That's the globalist to put us under.
[45:54.040 --> 45:55.920]  They've got us under mind control.
[45:55.920 --> 45:57.920]  They've got us in a fantasy land.
[45:57.920 --> 46:00.400]  So let me just show you headlines.
[46:00.400 --> 46:03.680]  I'm going to drill back through these for you.
[46:03.680 --> 46:06.640]  This is just the latest, the last few days on COVID.
[46:06.640 --> 46:12.520]  Health experts, that means people on the billable and the gates at UN payroll, the ones that
[46:12.520 --> 46:15.840]  lied to us about every single thing, gave us all fake numbers and stand again to make
[46:15.840 --> 46:16.840]  money off of it.
[46:16.840 --> 46:18.640]  Total frauds, you need to go to prison.
[46:18.640 --> 46:23.080]  Health experts encourage CDC to implement permanent mask mandates.
[46:23.080 --> 46:27.800]  That's an infowars.com article and it links to BBC, CNN, all of them.
[46:27.800 --> 46:30.200]  Well, I could have told you that.
[46:30.200 --> 46:34.440]  Bill Gates said last year, hell, over a year ago when it all started, he said, oh, it's
[46:34.440 --> 46:39.320]  never going to end and mask will be like wearing seat belts and you'll get five shots a year
[46:39.320 --> 46:40.320]  at least.
[46:40.320 --> 46:42.000]  They're like, how did you predict it?
[46:42.000 --> 46:43.200]  I didn't predict it.
[46:43.200 --> 46:45.800]  They got a plan.
[46:45.800 --> 46:51.160]  And I know major cattlemen, I know people that own steakhouses and they're smart folks,
[46:51.160 --> 46:57.040]  but you tell them, hey, they're really coming to shut you down with regulations and controls.
[46:57.040 --> 46:59.360]  They're like, Alex, America's never going to put up with that.
[46:59.360 --> 47:06.200]  Oh, like phasing out regular cars, several states are passing laws banning the sale of
[47:06.200 --> 47:10.280]  non-electric cars in nine years.
[47:10.280 --> 47:15.560]  The level of tyranny we'll live under is the level we put up with.
[47:15.560 --> 47:16.560]  I'm sorry.
[47:16.560 --> 47:19.600]  I said I'll just read you the headlines.
[47:19.600 --> 47:23.960]  Stanford study results, face masks are ineffective to block transmission of COVID-19 actually
[47:23.960 --> 47:30.400]  can cause health deterioration and premature death, but who cares about the facts?
[47:30.400 --> 47:36.080]  New studies suggest wearing a mask is ineffective.
[47:36.080 --> 47:39.160]  New study highlights face mask problems with safety and epilepsy.
[47:39.160 --> 47:40.160]  Oh, really?
[47:40.160 --> 47:43.080]  It's a total damn cult.
[47:43.080 --> 47:49.120]  And here's a new article, risk of dying from AstraZeneca vaccine higher than that of COVID-Norway
[47:49.120 --> 47:50.440]  fines.
[47:50.440 --> 47:56.520]  Norwegians run a greater risk of dying from being inoculated with AstraZeneca's vaccine
[47:56.520 --> 48:01.760]  than from COVID-19 and AstroMunstude, a public health concluded in its analysis recommending
[48:01.760 --> 48:08.040]  the vaccine previously linked to serious complications, form of rare blood clots, and hemorrhaging
[48:08.040 --> 48:12.320]  amid low platelet counts, same death were happening with the other vaccines here, all
[48:12.320 --> 48:20.280]  of the virus vector systems were used as a virus to deliver another virus and then reprogram
[48:20.280 --> 48:21.280]  your DNA.
[48:21.280 --> 48:22.280]  Let's continue.
[48:22.280 --> 48:27.520]  It's all a test of how many of you they can kill, CDC investigating another woman's
[48:27.520 --> 48:36.160]  death after J&J vaccine, there's stacks of these, Germany, France, back in you pushed
[48:36.160 --> 48:42.520]  the sue AstraZeneca over botched vaccine rollout, rats leaving the sinking ship.
[48:42.520 --> 48:46.760]  Remember, why did Merck pull out three months ago?
[48:46.760 --> 48:50.360]  They said you cannot produce a safe vaccine for the cold virus.
[48:50.360 --> 48:56.840]  If you do, it causes autoimmune responses, allergic reactions in a large number of, because
[48:56.840 --> 49:00.240]  they said we don't care if you wave lab test, we're doing lab test.
[49:00.240 --> 49:05.160]  And even corrupt Merck said, we suggest you don't take vaccines and you just get herd
[49:05.160 --> 49:06.160]  immunity.
[49:06.160 --> 49:07.160]  Oh, really?
[49:07.160 --> 49:11.960]  Because if you make a vaccine that is broad enough for the protein that's in the cold
[49:11.960 --> 49:15.040]  virus, then it's going to attack your own damn body.
[49:15.040 --> 49:17.840]  Duh, that's what all the top scientists said.
[49:17.840 --> 49:20.560]  That's why I keep saying, why would they do something this reckless?
[49:20.560 --> 49:26.160]  Well, we've done the analysis and it's bone chilling.
[49:26.160 --> 49:27.160]  Bone chilling.
[49:27.160 --> 49:32.240]  I mean, I'm not somebody that scares easy because I'm ready to die, but I love my children.
[49:32.240 --> 49:35.960]  But I mean, I'm beyond pissed off with the globalist, okay?
[49:35.960 --> 49:39.000]  Let's just say this.
[49:39.000 --> 49:42.720]  I'm not afraid to die, but a big forest fire is coming with 80 mile an hour winds.
[49:42.720 --> 49:44.160]  And in five minutes, I'm going to be burned up.
[49:44.160 --> 49:46.240]  I'm going to haul ass away from it.
[49:46.240 --> 49:50.480]  I'm not scared, but I'm not stupid.
[49:50.480 --> 49:53.080]  Every instinct I've got is just run to the hills right now.
[49:53.080 --> 49:56.760]  I mean, these people are psychotics, because let me explain something.
[49:56.760 --> 49:59.800]  If they're killing and naming this many people, they'll only do that if they've got something
[49:59.800 --> 50:04.920]  bigger planned that'll cover, that you'll remember this is a fond memory.
[50:04.920 --> 50:06.240]  And I got a pretty good idea of what they're doing.
[50:06.240 --> 50:07.560]  In fact, it's coming into view now.
[50:07.560 --> 50:12.800]  I'm going to explain in a moment, man, I'll tell you, I just, you know, I got a sixth
[50:12.800 --> 50:16.680]  sense of humor, though, but all you left is small, you liberals and all you FBI agents
[50:16.680 --> 50:19.620]  that are out there persecuting folks from the Capitol, I think you're part of the system
[50:19.620 --> 50:21.120]  and all you dumb lawyers.
[50:21.120 --> 50:22.600]  I mean, it's all over, folks.
[50:22.600 --> 50:27.680]  It's game fricking over civilization is gone and this goes through and I know why God's
[50:27.680 --> 50:28.680]  got me on air.
[50:28.680 --> 50:33.520]  So you devils out there that laughed at this will later repent to God and for the people
[50:33.520 --> 50:37.760]  now that are going to listen, I just, whatever you do, I'd get ready because my gut and my
[50:37.760 --> 50:42.560]  intellect tells me just it's off the chart.
[50:42.560 --> 50:44.560]  It's off the chart.
[50:44.560 --> 50:50.720]  Germany, France, back EU push to sue AstraZeneca over botched vaccine rollout, report Pfizer
[50:50.720 --> 50:56.480]  and Moderna COVID vaccines could trigger Alzheimer's, morbid studies, ALS and other neurological
[50:56.480 --> 51:01.640]  diseases and the new report of microbiology and infectious diseases.
[51:01.640 --> 51:07.560]  Oh, but look, CNN's, here's all the free stuff you get.
[51:07.560 --> 51:13.480]  Krispy Kreme, Junior's Cheesecake, Nathan's Hot Dogs and White Castle.
[51:13.480 --> 51:14.480]  Wow.
[51:14.480 --> 51:17.440]  If you get the vaccine, you get all this free goodies.
[51:17.440 --> 51:23.160]  You also get blood clots and Alzheimer's and death.
[51:23.160 --> 51:24.160]  Wow.
[51:24.160 --> 51:26.600]  As long as I got a free hot dog, it's okay.
[51:26.600 --> 51:27.600]  Here's this big article.
[51:27.600 --> 51:30.680]  Let's pull this one up.
[51:30.680 --> 51:35.840]  India's public health ambassador dies day after taking COVID vaccines.
[51:35.840 --> 51:41.160]  The country's top comic or the top movie stars in the country, popular actor and comedian
[51:41.160 --> 51:42.160]  Vivek.
[51:42.160 --> 51:49.400]  Vivekik, he received it one day, died the next of a heart attack from arterial blockages,
[51:49.400 --> 51:50.400]  which is in the studies.
[51:50.400 --> 51:54.920]  Like an mRNA vaccine or other ones, it causes an autoimmune response, your body can attack
[51:54.920 --> 52:01.840]  your own body where you have plaques, similar proteins in heart plaques that can cause inflammation
[52:01.840 --> 52:05.720]  or you can have an autoimmune response and other things happen or you can have an allergic
[52:05.720 --> 52:06.720]  response.
[52:06.720 --> 52:11.040]  But needless to say, a lot of the folks that take it end up having these big heart attacks
[52:11.040 --> 52:14.160]  like DMX and others.
[52:14.160 --> 52:17.520]  And so it's getting serious, ladies and gentlemen.
[52:17.520 --> 52:18.520]  It's getting serious.
[52:18.520 --> 52:20.960]  It's not the guy that died, that's somebody going in and talking about it.
[52:20.960 --> 52:21.960]  Can we pull up the article?
[52:21.960 --> 52:23.360]  There it is.
[52:23.360 --> 52:28.000]  There is the public health spokesperson telling you the vaccine is safe.
[52:28.000 --> 52:36.520]  He took it on TV and he wasn't smart like Merkel or Boris Johnson or Biden or Netanyahu.
[52:36.520 --> 52:39.400]  They actually put it in him and, well, you know what happened.
[52:39.400 --> 52:42.240]  He's dead in doornail now.
[52:42.240 --> 52:47.000]  Merck pulls the plug on COVID-19 vaccine program after disappointing test trials.
[52:47.000 --> 52:51.400]  That's from January, I just wanted to remind you of that and show you that.
[52:51.400 --> 52:56.600]  See, they don't want to get the blame for what's coming.
[52:56.600 --> 53:02.120]  Indian vaccine makers jack up prices has outbreak worsens, first COVID triple mutant identified
[53:02.120 --> 53:07.160]  and they go on to admit that they believe, a set of zero hedge, that the vaccine is causing
[53:07.160 --> 53:08.160]  mutations in the cells.
[53:08.160 --> 53:12.040]  Oh, that's what the top scientist warned of six months ago.
[53:12.040 --> 53:15.120]  In fact, here it is out of NPR of all places.
[53:15.120 --> 53:21.720]  This could drive the evolution of more COVID-19 mutants that are actually deadly, but that's
[53:21.720 --> 53:27.920]  okay because Governor Cuomo didn't just kill 5,000 or 8,000 or 14,000 or something.
[53:27.920 --> 53:32.560]  Now it's 20 plus thousand old people died when their families couldn't come see him
[53:32.560 --> 53:38.800]  and they locked up the nursing homes and who knows what really killed him because he was
[53:38.800 --> 53:46.880]  getting $53,000 for the companies that allowed the old people to die every time somebody died
[53:46.880 --> 53:47.880]  of COVID.
[53:47.880 --> 53:48.880]  So there you go.
[53:48.880 --> 53:49.880]  What a criminal.
[53:49.880 --> 53:50.880]  What a mastermind.
[53:50.880 --> 53:54.880]  The covered up continues as Governor Andrew Cuomo refuses to release COVID nursing home
[53:54.880 --> 53:57.840]  death numbers.
[53:57.840 --> 53:59.720]  Thousands in London protesting against vaccine passports.
[53:59.720 --> 54:03.440]  I love the left is talking about, hey, it's only private companies that are going to make
[54:03.440 --> 54:04.440]  you have the vaccine passports.
[54:04.440 --> 54:05.440]  No, it's not.
[54:05.440 --> 54:06.960]  It's never been the plan.
[54:06.960 --> 54:09.440]  First they make corporations make you do it and then governments do.
[54:09.440 --> 54:10.440]  Here it is.
[54:10.440 --> 54:13.640]  Fully vaccinated Americans will be able to vacation to the EU this summer.
[54:13.640 --> 54:17.440]  European Commission President tells New York Times they're going to make you have the vaccine
[54:17.440 --> 54:18.440]  to travel.
[54:18.440 --> 54:22.400]  Of course they don't tell you about little waiver forms or PCR tests you can pay for
[54:22.400 --> 54:28.680]  and claim you don't have it, but we have Hawaii saying people now that want to come
[54:28.680 --> 54:31.360]  to Hawaii have to have it are those that travel island to island.
[54:31.360 --> 54:35.440]  This is the takeover.
[54:35.440 --> 54:41.320]  I haven't even scratched the surface yet of the COVID-19 news disturbing.
[54:41.320 --> 54:46.080]  Vaccine zoomed in with microscope appears to show living cells, organisms mixed in.
[54:46.080 --> 54:48.200]  Mike Adams has found even more information.
[54:48.200 --> 54:49.680]  He'll join us in the third hour.
[54:49.680 --> 54:53.040]  I've got the really big news on what's really happening in India, how they're really dying
[54:53.040 --> 54:54.040]  of starvation.
[54:54.040 --> 54:57.320]  And the media even claims, oh, look, they're burning bodies.
[54:57.320 --> 54:58.320]  There's so many.
[54:58.320 --> 55:02.320]  That's how they get rid of dead people over there, this cremation.
[55:02.320 --> 55:06.760]  This is going to be critical information next hour and so much more on the Supreme Court
[55:06.760 --> 55:09.680]  to take up banning concealed carry.
[55:09.680 --> 55:11.400]  Now they've got a good list of who's got the guns.
[55:11.400 --> 55:13.440]  Now they can ban, ban, ban.
[55:13.440 --> 55:17.440]  As the Ninth Circuit just said, all concealed are banned.
[55:17.440 --> 55:19.120]  So I've been saying that's a setup for a long time.
[55:19.120 --> 55:20.120]  I've got a concealed carry myself.
[55:20.120 --> 55:22.440]  I just said it's a stopgap to protect yourself.
[55:22.440 --> 55:25.400]  It turns a right to a privilege, though, and down the road they're going to be coming
[55:25.400 --> 55:26.400]  for that.
[55:26.400 --> 55:27.400]  So that's coming up.
[55:27.400 --> 55:33.400]  The FBI documents bombshell undisclosed entity could have paid for Seth Rich's murder.
[55:33.400 --> 55:38.240]  Now with the Democrats to everybody that even asked basic questions, it's all coming up
[55:38.240 --> 55:39.240]  in hour number two.
[55:39.240 --> 55:42.760]  Please don't forget that being sold out for months and months and months and months,

[55:52.760 --> 55:53.760]  Granny Do Right.
[55:53.760 --> 55:54.760]  Granny Do Right.
[55:54.760 --> 55:55.760]  Thanks for holding her on the air.
[55:55.760 --> 55:56.760]  Go ahead.
[55:56.760 --> 55:57.760]  Thanks, Paul.
[55:57.760 --> 55:59.120]  Let me say I love your products.
[55:59.120 --> 56:04.640]  I am a granny and for all the senior citizens out there that may have spent a lifetime in
[56:04.640 --> 56:10.120]  the sun like me, I was loaded up with sunspots or age spots as they're lovingly called.
[56:10.120 --> 56:15.440]  But since taking your X2 for the last couple of years, my skin is just really gorgeous,
[56:15.440 --> 56:16.440]  actually.
[56:16.440 --> 56:19.440]  People think I'm 55 years old.
[56:19.440 --> 56:23.480]  And I was already taking your other supplements, but I thought, you know, well, maybe that's
[56:23.480 --> 56:27.080]  what I need to do because I just thought it was a hopeless situation.
[56:27.080 --> 56:31.600]  But when I started taking it, I mean, it doesn't happen immediately, but you know, over a period
[56:31.600 --> 56:36.800]  of time, I started noticing, okay, you know, this is a ticket, this is working, this is
[56:36.800 --> 56:42.080]  wonderful, you know, I don't have to put on derma blend anymore, you know.
[56:42.080 --> 56:47.840]  So anyway, it worked wonderfully and it really has totally cleared up my skin.
[56:47.840 --> 56:53.920]  All of the experts agree that getting proper sleep is the cornerstone of good health.
[56:53.920 --> 56:58.480]  It has been proven that a poor sleep schedule is linked with numerous health problems, including
[56:58.480 --> 57:03.720]  weight gain, memory issues, mood changes, poor concentration and even a weakened immune
[57:03.720 --> 57:04.720]  system.

[57:52.480 --> 58:22.400]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[58:22.400 --> 58:49.760]  All right, this next report makes me really, really angry because it was 100% preventable
[58:49.760 --> 58:55.240]  and 100% premeditated and admitted by these monsters.
[58:55.240 --> 59:00.560]  So guys, find me the UN food director a year ago saying this is going to starve 286 million
[59:00.560 --> 59:01.560]  people to death.
[59:01.560 --> 59:02.560]  Thanks.
[59:02.560 --> 59:03.560]  Now it's happening.
[59:03.560 --> 59:04.560]  The left loves it.
[59:04.560 --> 59:08.160]  But first, here's a very important clip from American Journal, weekday mornings, 8 a.m.
[59:08.160 --> 59:10.160]  to 11 a.m. right here at info wars.
[59:10.160 --> 59:19.360]  Just look at in game, I just I watched in game this weekend for the second time really
[59:19.360 --> 59:20.360]  diving into it.
[59:20.360 --> 59:22.440]  I mean, it talks about everything now.
[59:22.440 --> 59:28.320]  I just recommend everybody just watch that and and pray that's the biggest thing you
[59:28.320 --> 59:33.280]  can do right now is is to make sure that you pray and that you just stay focused right
[59:33.280 --> 59:37.520]  now because they want to attack your mind and that's the greatest pool that you have
[59:37.520 --> 59:40.600]  and you must on my kids are trying to break in on me.
[59:40.600 --> 59:42.120]  That's the greatest thing.
[59:42.120 --> 59:43.120]  Yeah.
[59:43.120 --> 59:45.600]  I have a one in the three year old.
[59:45.600 --> 59:49.280]  So yeah, matter of fact, you might like to hear him real quick.
[59:49.280 --> 59:50.280]  Yeah, here.
[59:50.280 --> 59:51.280]  I hear him.
[59:51.280 --> 59:52.280]  All right.
[59:52.280 --> 59:53.280]  We'll let you go.
[59:53.280 --> 59:54.280]  Go ahead and go.
[59:54.280 --> 59:59.480]  Vitamin, vitamin mineral forest, lung, clean, the D3 man get it everybody.
[59:59.480 --> 1:00:00.480]  I appreciate you.
[1:00:00.480 --> 1:00:01.480]  Harrison, I'll talk to you.
[1:00:01.480 --> 1:00:02.480]  So man, guys fantastic.
[1:00:02.480 --> 1:00:03.480]  Thank you so much, Trey.
[1:00:03.480 --> 1:00:04.480]  All right.
[1:00:04.480 --> 1:00:06.120]  Trey's going to go take care of his kids.
[1:00:06.120 --> 1:00:07.120]  Good.
[1:00:07.120 --> 1:00:08.120]  Thank you, man.
[1:00:08.120 --> 1:00:09.120]  Really amazing stuff.
[1:00:09.120 --> 1:00:10.120]  Some people get it.
[1:00:10.120 --> 1:00:13.200]  And and it's like it's like banging your head against the wall.
[1:00:13.200 --> 1:00:17.920]  And the thing I always said about Alex Jones was, you know, when he's out there sort of
[1:00:17.920 --> 1:00:22.320]  being bombastic, being being loud, I mean, it makes people uncomfortable.
[1:00:22.320 --> 1:00:24.520]  But what he's yelling is the bombs are falling.
[1:00:24.520 --> 1:00:26.120]  We are under attack.
[1:00:26.120 --> 1:00:30.760]  So while it may seem crazy, this guy's run around, you know, flailing his arms going,
[1:00:30.760 --> 1:00:31.760]  oh, we're under attack.
[1:00:31.760 --> 1:00:34.680]  It's like, yeah, but but what if you could hear the bombs?
[1:00:34.680 --> 1:00:38.800]  What if you could see them careening towards your village about to explode and obliterate
[1:00:38.800 --> 1:00:39.800]  all of you?
[1:00:39.800 --> 1:00:41.600]  Wouldn't you also be running around screaming?
[1:00:41.600 --> 1:00:42.760]  Isn't that the correct response?
[1:00:42.760 --> 1:00:47.680]  Actually, if you're under the threat that Alex Jones is talking about.
[1:00:47.680 --> 1:00:50.800]  And now that the bombs are falling around us and dropping and exploding, everybody's
[1:00:50.800 --> 1:00:54.240]  going, huh, there were bombs falling this whole time.
[1:00:54.240 --> 1:00:56.520]  We were under attack this entire time.
[1:00:56.520 --> 1:00:57.520]  Who knew?
[1:00:57.520 --> 1:00:58.520]  Why didn't anybody tell us?
[1:00:58.520 --> 1:01:02.760]  So that's sort of the situation that you know, I used to say, you know, if you don't
[1:01:02.760 --> 1:01:07.320]  like Alex, you have to recognize the bombs are falling and being outrageous, being loud,
[1:01:07.320 --> 1:01:14.200]  being angry about that is the correct response is absolutely the correct response.
[1:01:14.200 --> 1:01:20.840]  The fury and anger and energy that comes out when you understand the threat that you're
[1:01:20.840 --> 1:01:24.800]  truly under it is absolutely appropriate and actually necessary.
[1:01:24.800 --> 1:01:27.960]  And now the bombs are falling.
[1:01:27.960 --> 1:01:29.280]  People still don't get it.
[1:01:29.280 --> 1:01:33.560]  Other houses are being blown up and they're like Alex Jones guy says bombs are falling
[1:01:33.560 --> 1:01:37.040]  just like and then they still don't understand.
[1:01:37.040 --> 1:01:38.520]  So all right, well, we'll keep trying.
[1:01:38.520 --> 1:01:39.640]  We'll keep pushing out the message.
[1:01:39.640 --> 1:01:41.760]  We'll keep trying to awaken them.
[1:01:41.760 --> 1:01:45.760]  And once they're awake, let them know, yeah, the bombs are falling, but we've got a bomb
[1:01:45.760 --> 1:01:46.760]  shelter.
[1:01:46.760 --> 1:01:47.760]  It's called Liberty.
[1:01:47.760 --> 1:01:54.560]  We have a shield, a magnificent iron dome protecting us from the bombardment.
[1:01:54.560 --> 1:01:56.200]  And it's called activism.
[1:01:56.200 --> 1:01:58.200]  It's called human engagement.
[1:01:58.200 --> 1:02:02.560]  It's called the freeing of the human mind from all forms of tyranny over the minds of
[1:02:02.560 --> 1:02:03.560]  man.
[1:02:03.560 --> 1:02:04.560]  It's called the First Amendment.
[1:02:04.560 --> 1:02:05.560]  It's called the Second Amendment.
[1:02:05.560 --> 1:02:11.560]  It's just that we've allowed these bulwarks to be undermined.
[1:02:11.560 --> 1:02:18.080]  You know, that term comes from right undermining a wall of the castle undermining defenses.
[1:02:18.080 --> 1:02:25.160]  You literally mine under them to disrupt the foundation and collapse a wall so you can
[1:02:25.160 --> 1:02:26.160]  then get in.
[1:02:26.160 --> 1:02:33.840]  What's happened with all with our bulwarks, every aspect of the facade that protects our
[1:02:33.840 --> 1:02:36.320]  liberties has been dismantled for a long time.
[1:02:36.320 --> 1:02:41.000]  So now the attack happens once the wall is down, the troops invade.
[1:02:41.000 --> 1:02:42.920]  That's how war works.
[1:02:42.920 --> 1:02:46.360]  Information war and regular old fashioned war.
[1:02:46.360 --> 1:02:54.240]  So I'm so glad that the people out there realized that and that I pray for discernment on behalf
[1:02:54.240 --> 1:02:57.680]  of everybody else out there that doesn't seem to recognize what's happening.
[1:02:57.680 --> 1:03:01.560]  Last week I had a caller to my radio slash TV transmission.
[1:03:01.560 --> 1:03:05.560]  He said to me, he said, Alex, there's all these facts and all these numbers of vaccines
[1:03:05.560 --> 1:03:09.280]  being recalled and people dying from it and people getting sick.
[1:03:09.280 --> 1:03:13.280]  How do I reach out to my friends and family and explain to them and to warn them about
[1:03:13.280 --> 1:03:14.280]  the danger?
[1:03:14.280 --> 1:03:18.400]  And I said to him, something very profound because it's so true.
[1:03:18.400 --> 1:03:19.400]  Trust your gut.
[1:03:19.400 --> 1:03:20.400]  Trust your spirit.
[1:03:20.400 --> 1:03:21.400]  With the Bible tells us.
[1:03:21.400 --> 1:03:26.720]  And I said, ask those friends, those family, those neighbors, do you feel good about this
[1:03:26.720 --> 1:03:27.720]  vaccine?
[1:03:27.720 --> 1:03:29.760]  And his answer was, no, they don't feel good about it.
[1:03:29.760 --> 1:03:31.480]  So go with your gut.
[1:03:31.480 --> 1:03:35.480]  Well, let me ask you again, how does your gut feel about getting the storeable food?
[1:03:35.480 --> 1:03:38.320]  How does your gut feel about getting out in the countryside?
[1:03:38.320 --> 1:03:41.120]  How does your gut feel about getting guns and ammo to protect yourself?
[1:03:41.120 --> 1:03:43.280]  Well, I know what your gut's telling you.

[1:03:52.640 --> 1:04:18.840]  Go with your gut and find the InfoWarsStore.com.
[1:04:18.840 --> 1:04:27.480]  So I'm going to lay it on you right now with just one story that illustrates an entire universe
[1:04:27.480 --> 1:04:28.480]  of information.
[1:04:28.480 --> 1:04:31.480]  And this is how my brain works.
[1:04:31.480 --> 1:04:34.360]  And as the Bible says, the people perish for lack of knowledge.
[1:04:34.360 --> 1:04:39.400]  I took off Saturday, I took off Sunday, spent time with my family, with my children.
[1:04:39.400 --> 1:04:41.720]  And I said I'd put my phone away, wouldn't get on the computer.
[1:04:41.720 --> 1:04:47.160]  But I got some phone calls, had to go get something off of the email.
[1:04:47.160 --> 1:04:55.040]  And I go and can't help it, I just want to see what the enemy's up to, I type in CNN.com.
[1:04:55.040 --> 1:05:02.480]  And boom, it shows New Delhi and it shows Indian cities and it says they're having to
[1:05:02.480 --> 1:05:06.560]  burn bodies outside, there's so many bodies.
[1:05:06.560 --> 1:05:10.280]  I go wait a minute, India's always for thousands of years, especially the Hindus, get rid of
[1:05:10.280 --> 1:05:16.560]  people via, rid of their bodies via fires.
[1:05:16.560 --> 1:05:19.120]  And I knew about the normal death numbers and statistics in India.
[1:05:19.120 --> 1:05:27.040]  And so I went and did an hour of research just to refresh my memory and sure enough,
[1:05:27.040 --> 1:05:30.600]  the sites of cremation they were showing are the public areas, but they don't just burn
[1:05:30.600 --> 1:05:37.920]  people individually, they burn poor people in big, giant, mass piles.
[1:05:37.920 --> 1:05:45.560]  So they're CNN, fear-mongering that India's in this big, giant crisis and there's all
[1:05:45.560 --> 1:05:53.800]  this incredible fear and we better take all our vaccines here because everybody is dying
[1:05:53.800 --> 1:06:01.720]  in India and they've got an oxygen tank deficiency and the U.S. military is going to fly over
[1:06:01.720 --> 1:06:08.040]  there to the aid of India to save them because COVID is so real.
[1:06:08.040 --> 1:06:12.200]  And then I spent more time this morning going and drilling through about two hours, got
[1:06:12.200 --> 1:06:14.680]  up at about 4 a.m.
[1:06:14.680 --> 1:06:17.680]  I've got a whole giant stack of articles, I'll show you right here, I'll just put the
[1:06:17.680 --> 1:06:26.560]  next three hours on this, where they actually admit that there's massive deaths in the millions,
[1:06:26.560 --> 1:06:32.760]  millions, they estimate over two million extra Indians have died of malnutrition.
[1:06:32.760 --> 1:06:40.200]  That means you get skinny, you get weak, you get sick and then any virus or bacteria can
[1:06:40.200 --> 1:06:41.200]  kill you.
[1:06:41.200 --> 1:06:44.520]  That's what malnutrition does.
[1:06:44.520 --> 1:06:47.280]  That's all the Soviets had to do was send you to a gulag and not feed you nothing, you
[1:06:47.280 --> 1:06:49.600]  just die of any regular cold.
[1:06:49.600 --> 1:06:55.320]  So I'm going to get into that in a moment.
[1:06:55.320 --> 1:06:58.800]  But they estimate, I've got the numbers right here, the next two million Indians have starved
[1:06:58.800 --> 1:07:06.040]  to death during the lockdown and the millions more are set to starve to death and the people
[1:07:06.040 --> 1:07:14.080]  are going into sex slavery to pay their bills and all this and that's known fact.
[1:07:14.080 --> 1:07:17.360]  But now when people die, they don't even test them.
[1:07:17.360 --> 1:07:21.320]  They're just saying they've got COVID and then when they go burn their little shriveled
[1:07:21.320 --> 1:07:26.360]  skinny bodies that starve to death under the lockdowns and under the breakdown of the supply
[1:07:26.360 --> 1:07:34.080]  food chain, they tell you it's COVID and then continue the lockdowns and intensify lockdowns
[1:07:34.080 --> 1:07:35.800]  which then cause more people to starve to death.
[1:07:35.800 --> 1:07:36.800]  See how it works?
[1:07:36.800 --> 1:07:41.960]  And by the way, the left hand or the right hand, I don't know what the other one's doing,
[1:07:41.960 --> 1:07:47.720]  the UN food director says the lockdowns are killing, in his words, 10 to 20 times what
[1:07:47.720 --> 1:07:51.000]  COVID is even if you believe the inflated COVID numbers.
[1:07:51.000 --> 1:07:58.440]  So this is not even debated that the lockdowns in the third world are starving people en masse
[1:07:58.440 --> 1:08:04.280]  and now Biden can be the savior to send aid of oxygen tanks when what they need is food,
[1:08:04.280 --> 1:08:08.600]  they need vitamins, they need minerals.
[1:08:08.600 --> 1:08:10.320]  Yeah that was early on in April last year.
[1:08:10.320 --> 1:08:13.400]  They went up to 200 plus million they said was starving to death.
[1:08:13.400 --> 1:08:18.080]  World Food Program warns at least 30 million people could die of starvation during pandemic.
[1:08:18.080 --> 1:08:19.840]  Not from the virus.
[1:08:19.840 --> 1:08:25.160]  And now you look at the people and the dead bodies, I watched it last night and this morning
[1:08:25.160 --> 1:08:29.240]  and they are little and they are shriveled, they weigh like 90 pounds.
[1:08:29.240 --> 1:08:35.520]  The men weigh 90 pounds, the women weigh 70 pounds and they are burning them.
[1:08:35.520 --> 1:08:37.000]  Now let me go over these headlines for you.
[1:08:37.000 --> 1:08:40.640]  I'm going to move quick.
[1:08:40.640 --> 1:08:44.280]  World Food Program's David Beasley, he's the head of it, we have a clip of him in a moment.
[1:08:44.280 --> 1:08:51.200]  Warns of dire famines in Africa, Mideast, Asia if COVID-19 supply change, damage continues
[1:08:51.200 --> 1:08:53.600]  and also in India.
[1:08:53.600 --> 1:08:56.600]  World Food Program warns at least 30 million, just showed you that.
[1:08:56.600 --> 1:09:00.680]  So 130 million people could starve because of the lockdowns.
[1:09:00.680 --> 1:09:06.360]  That was a few months after April when the numbers went up, now it's 287 million.
[1:09:06.360 --> 1:09:10.000]  Last night, over 200 million people pushed into extreme poverty.
[1:09:10.000 --> 1:09:13.480]  New U.N. development report finds starvation.
[1:09:13.480 --> 1:09:18.200]  That's the U.N.org.
[1:09:18.200 --> 1:09:22.200]  Instead of coronavirus, the hunger will kill us, a global food crisis looms.
[1:09:22.200 --> 1:09:27.120]  New York Times back in April last year.
[1:09:27.120 --> 1:09:28.640]  And we made a big deal about this.
[1:09:28.640 --> 1:09:32.400]  You made a big deal out of this.
[1:09:32.400 --> 1:09:37.280]  And so top scientists came out and said, and even the U.N. envoy on COVID said, we should
[1:09:37.280 --> 1:09:38.280]  end the lockdowns.
[1:09:38.280 --> 1:09:42.840]  It's starving 10 times the people that COVID's killing, but they never really ended it.
[1:09:42.840 --> 1:09:46.600]  So here we are, watching people starve as from malnutrition.
[1:09:46.600 --> 1:09:48.560]  They're saying it's COVID.
[1:09:48.560 --> 1:09:51.640]  They're lying and saying, look, they're burning people outside because there's so many dead.
[1:09:51.640 --> 1:09:52.800]  They always do that.
[1:09:52.800 --> 1:09:56.720]  They're lying to you at every level to then use that fear to keep the lockdowns going
[1:09:56.720 --> 1:10:03.480]  there and here that make us become poor and make them die.
[1:10:03.480 --> 1:10:06.360]  Yeah, even there's the Washington Post.
[1:10:06.360 --> 1:10:11.720]  Lockdowns will starve people in low-income countries, but they don't care.
[1:10:11.720 --> 1:10:12.720]  It goes on.
[1:10:12.720 --> 1:10:20.360]  So COVID, Delhi announces lockdowns as India cases surge.
[1:10:20.360 --> 1:10:23.440]  This just came out a few days ago.
[1:10:23.440 --> 1:10:27.240]  So more of the lockdowns that cause starvation go in your house and starve to death.
[1:10:27.240 --> 1:10:30.840]  That's all they're doing is depopulating India and their government is going along with
[1:10:30.840 --> 1:10:31.840]  it.
[1:10:31.840 --> 1:10:32.840]  You see that?
[1:10:32.840 --> 1:10:39.240]  The virtue signaling dumb liberals with your dumb mask and your dumb checkpoints and all
[1:10:39.240 --> 1:10:46.360]  your crap, New Delhi announces lockdowns as India cases surge.
[1:10:46.360 --> 1:10:49.240]  The cases surge is the fake PCR test.
[1:10:49.240 --> 1:10:54.680]  And here it is, the State Department memorandum, 294 Henry Kissinger on how to starve to death
[1:10:54.680 --> 1:11:01.320]  and how to kill the third world 47 years ago, the year I was born.
[1:11:01.320 --> 1:11:04.320]  So let's keep moving through this and this death sentence.
[1:11:04.320 --> 1:11:05.600]  And of course, they're going to get us here now.
[1:11:05.600 --> 1:11:07.520]  They're going to shut us down over the next few years.
[1:11:07.520 --> 1:11:08.600]  They're going to start starving us.
[1:11:08.600 --> 1:11:10.160]  They're already announcing you won't get meat anymore.
[1:11:10.160 --> 1:11:12.240]  I mean, this is a real dystopia.
[1:11:12.240 --> 1:11:13.920]  These people aren't playing games.
[1:11:13.920 --> 1:11:15.240]  Coronavirus.
[1:11:15.240 --> 1:11:18.040]  India's lockdown turning into a humanitarian crisis.
[1:11:18.040 --> 1:11:23.080]  In the news, DW, that's from six, eight months ago, admitting mass starvation, millions already
[1:11:23.080 --> 1:11:26.080]  starved to death.
[1:11:26.080 --> 1:11:30.200]  Lockdown or starvation, poor economies, way impossible choice, foreign policy, even the
[1:11:30.200 --> 1:11:34.560]  left admits this because the headweather, you monsters.
[1:11:34.560 --> 1:11:39.960]  Lockdown will start people in low income countries, Washington Post, again, over a year ago.
[1:11:39.960 --> 1:11:42.320]  But a year later, they're not telling you why there's all this death.
[1:11:42.320 --> 1:11:44.320]  Oh, no, the virus did it.
[1:11:44.320 --> 1:11:45.320]  Not the starvation.
[1:11:45.320 --> 1:11:48.520]  Did the lockdowns in America kill people in Africa?
[1:11:48.520 --> 1:11:51.040]  Answer is yes.
[1:11:51.040 --> 1:11:55.800]  Tens of millions in India face calamitous situation due to the lockdown.
[1:11:55.800 --> 1:11:58.600]  March of last year, a year ago.
[1:11:58.600 --> 1:11:59.960]  And now they're dead.
[1:11:59.960 --> 1:12:00.960]  Millions dead.
[1:12:00.960 --> 1:12:01.960]  Got the numbers right here.
[1:12:01.960 --> 1:12:02.960]  U.N.
[1:12:02.960 --> 1:12:07.800]  Warn's number of people starving to death could double amid pandemic, MPR, May of last
[1:12:07.800 --> 1:12:08.800]  year.
[1:12:08.800 --> 1:12:13.880]  130 million people could starve because of the lockdowns, and then the latest numbers
[1:12:13.880 --> 1:12:16.160]  are 280 plus million.
[1:12:16.160 --> 1:12:19.960]  A tip to the world to go hungry while crops rot in fields because everything's locked
[1:12:19.960 --> 1:12:20.960]  down.
[1:12:20.960 --> 1:12:21.960]  Bloomberg.
[1:12:21.960 --> 1:12:27.520]  COVID-19 linked hunger could cause more deaths than the disease itself.
[1:12:27.520 --> 1:12:29.360]  New report finds.
[1:12:29.360 --> 1:12:34.200]  Time magazine, they even tell you, but then go ahead with it.
[1:12:34.200 --> 1:12:40.400]  We'd rather die of COVID than starve under the lockdown, they say in India and Africa.
[1:12:40.400 --> 1:12:42.320]  And boy, are they starving.
[1:12:42.320 --> 1:12:46.680]  COVID-19 lockdowns, eight-year-old dies of hunger as family struggles to make ends meet.
[1:12:46.680 --> 1:12:47.680]  The wire.
[1:12:47.680 --> 1:12:49.680]  Feel good about yourselves, leftists?
[1:12:49.680 --> 1:12:51.840]  Well, you're like, well, there aren't too many people.
[1:12:51.840 --> 1:12:52.840]  Exactly.
[1:12:52.840 --> 1:12:54.480]  It's about your sick power and your control.
[1:12:54.480 --> 1:12:55.480]  U.N.
[1:12:55.480 --> 1:12:56.480]  Warn's a biblical famine.
[1:12:56.480 --> 1:12:59.000]  This coronavirus threatens to leave three dozen nations starving.
[1:12:59.000 --> 1:13:00.600]  And what do they do, including India?
[1:13:00.600 --> 1:13:04.000]  It's the number one nation per capita death.
[1:13:04.000 --> 1:13:06.640]  They say it's COVID-19 and then scare us back.
[1:13:06.640 --> 1:13:10.480]  So a year ago, it was China doing all that Kabuki theater with all the fake stuff in
[1:13:10.480 --> 1:13:15.400]  the streets and then hyping up the regular thousands of deaths and they have those big
[1:13:15.400 --> 1:13:18.760]  cities of 15, 20, 30 million a piece.
[1:13:18.760 --> 1:13:22.120]  And then now they're going to have us all locked down again, watching the Indian starve
[1:13:22.120 --> 1:13:26.200]  that we're helping starve to death.
[1:13:26.200 --> 1:13:33.520]  Right in India, minor girls forced to trade bodies during lockdown.
[1:13:33.520 --> 1:13:37.400]  Now we'll show you the rest of the fraud when we come back and explain how this can be defeated.
[1:13:37.400 --> 1:13:42.560]  But this is a mass crime against humanity killing way more than Hitler, Stalin and Lenin
[1:13:42.560 --> 1:13:43.560]  did combined.
[1:13:43.560 --> 1:13:46.840]  I mean, this is unbelievable.
[1:13:46.840 --> 1:13:47.840]  This is incredible.
[1:13:47.840 --> 1:13:49.800]  The left doesn't care about third world populations.
[1:13:49.800 --> 1:13:50.800]  They want them dead.
[1:13:50.800 --> 1:13:51.800]  They're eugenics.
[1:13:51.800 --> 1:13:52.800]  Death cult.
[1:13:52.800 --> 1:13:53.800]  They want everybody dead.
[1:13:53.800 --> 1:13:54.800]  They're murdering criminals.
[1:13:54.800 --> 1:14:10.680]  Let's me stop a hundred and seventy years ago, the British royal family finance scientist

[1:16:36.840 --> 1:16:39.560]  I want to go read it, but I get it.
[1:16:39.560 --> 1:16:44.000]  You've got green hair and you support Apple that runs death camps in China and you're
[1:16:44.000 --> 1:16:45.520]  gay, so it's okay.
[1:16:45.520 --> 1:16:47.680]  Well, I don't care that you have green hair.
[1:16:47.680 --> 1:16:51.520]  It's not impressive and I don't care what you're doing with your giggling.
[1:16:51.520 --> 1:16:58.480]  The issue here is that the American people had ancestors that fought for basic freedom.
[1:16:58.480 --> 1:17:02.520]  That's why we're told all day how bad we are and how we're evil and how we can't be the
[1:17:02.520 --> 1:17:08.600]  model of anything because communist China has to be the good guy now and they have to
[1:17:08.600 --> 1:17:11.440]  dictate how we're supposed to live.
[1:17:11.440 --> 1:17:16.200]  And in India that has a huge population, the second largest in the world, their elites
[1:17:16.200 --> 1:17:19.080]  have the same attitude about needing to depopulate.
[1:17:19.080 --> 1:17:22.480]  And maybe you can argue that that's the case.
[1:17:22.480 --> 1:17:26.120]  But don't piss down my back and tell me it's raining.
[1:17:26.120 --> 1:17:32.880]  They're killing these people and they have cut their food off and I just showed you your
[1:17:32.880 --> 1:17:37.920]  precious New York Times and your precious Washington Post if you're a leftist, admitting
[1:17:37.920 --> 1:17:40.200]  all of this.
[1:17:40.200 --> 1:17:48.280]  And so then CNN goes, look, they're burning bodies outside because there's so many dead
[1:17:48.280 --> 1:17:53.680]  bodies and there are an increase of dead bodies and they're calling them COVID but they're
[1:17:53.680 --> 1:17:55.640]  always burning bodies outside.
[1:17:55.640 --> 1:18:02.000]  But there's been an increase in bodies, several million, that they admit have starved to death.
[1:18:02.000 --> 1:18:08.680]  And now there's another lockdown that will cause more starvation yet again.
[1:18:08.680 --> 1:18:10.320]  This is depopulation.
[1:18:10.320 --> 1:18:12.000]  So it was wrong when Hitler did it.
[1:18:12.000 --> 1:18:14.400]  It's wrong when Klaus Schwab does it.
[1:18:14.400 --> 1:18:15.960]  It's wrong when Bill Gates does it.
[1:18:15.960 --> 1:18:20.960]  But I'm not just going to blame all the trendy authoritarian eugenicists left.
[1:18:20.960 --> 1:18:22.480]  They're just cannon fodder.
[1:18:22.480 --> 1:18:24.040]  They're just brainwashed.
[1:18:24.040 --> 1:18:26.280]  They're just in a cult.
[1:18:26.280 --> 1:18:28.080]  Where are the Christian leaders?
[1:18:28.080 --> 1:18:29.280]  Where are the conservative leaders?
[1:18:29.280 --> 1:18:31.000]  Where are the members of Congress?
[1:18:31.000 --> 1:18:32.000]  This is a serious issue.
[1:18:32.000 --> 1:18:38.520]  Yeah, they found CNN 10 years ago complaining, look, India has public mass burnings of dead
[1:18:38.520 --> 1:18:40.240]  people.
[1:18:40.240 --> 1:18:41.240]  This is bad.
[1:18:41.240 --> 1:18:43.720]  Carbon dioxide is poisonous.
[1:18:43.720 --> 1:18:45.800]  You can't burn bodies.
[1:18:45.800 --> 1:18:48.440]  And that's part of the life cycle on the planet.
[1:18:48.440 --> 1:18:51.360]  And yeah, they use the ash for fertilizer.
[1:18:51.360 --> 1:18:52.720]  But wait a minute.
[1:18:52.720 --> 1:18:57.400]  It's the exact facilities, the exact places that they're now showing you going, look,
[1:18:57.400 --> 1:18:59.400]  they're burning bodies out of the open.
[1:18:59.400 --> 1:19:00.640]  It's like war in the world.
[1:19:00.640 --> 1:19:04.000]  It's like, I am legend.
[1:19:04.000 --> 1:19:07.960]  It's like the last man on earth with Vincent Price for their burning bodies.
[1:19:07.960 --> 1:19:09.440]  Look at it.
[1:19:09.440 --> 1:19:15.960]  That is the prescribed place in that city where they burn the bodies.
[1:19:15.960 --> 1:19:19.360]  Look, there's lines of them lined up.
[1:19:19.360 --> 1:19:25.680]  Yes, because they're dying from starvation and old age and a mix of things because there's
[1:19:25.680 --> 1:19:28.920]  1 billion 300.
[1:19:28.920 --> 1:19:29.920]  I forget the population.
[1:19:29.920 --> 1:19:31.920]  I think it's 1 billion, 300 million now.
[1:19:31.920 --> 1:19:34.240]  Will you guys please look up the India's population?
[1:19:34.240 --> 1:19:35.240]  China's what?
[1:19:35.240 --> 1:19:38.240]  1.5, 1.6.
[1:19:38.240 --> 1:19:41.360]  So it's just lie upon lie upon lie.
[1:19:41.360 --> 1:19:45.680]  Most of them are dying of starvation from malnutrition.
[1:19:45.680 --> 1:19:47.720]  That's the reality of what's going on.
[1:19:47.720 --> 1:19:52.000]  All right, let's continue here, overhead shot, please.
[1:19:52.000 --> 1:19:55.040]  India, coronavirus.
[1:19:55.040 --> 1:20:02.240]  Bodies piling up at deli crematoriums as human remains burned next to the pavement.
[1:20:02.240 --> 1:20:06.160]  And then these are just the open crematorium areas with the pavement around it designed
[1:20:06.160 --> 1:20:07.160]  to do it.
[1:20:07.160 --> 1:20:10.960]  Just by the pavement, they're burning them by the side of the street.
[1:20:10.960 --> 1:20:12.440]  They defecate the street there, too.
[1:20:12.440 --> 1:20:14.880]  I've never been to India, but I've got friends and family in there.
[1:20:14.880 --> 1:20:18.920]  I know a lot of Indian folks, they tell me they're never going back.
[1:20:18.920 --> 1:20:22.560]  They're proud of their Indian heritage, but it's a hellhole.
[1:20:22.560 --> 1:20:23.560]  India is a hellhole.
[1:20:23.560 --> 1:20:29.920]  One of our crew members once on their vacation went alone and he was walking through with
[1:20:29.920 --> 1:20:30.920]  Jakari Jackson.
[1:20:30.920 --> 1:20:32.720]  He was writing a comic book about India.
[1:20:32.720 --> 1:20:37.920]  He was enamored by a swum dog millionaire and he was just walking through a street and he
[1:20:37.920 --> 1:20:43.960]  fell into like seven feet of sewage just through the ground, just through what looked like the
[1:20:43.960 --> 1:20:45.200]  walkway.
[1:20:45.200 --> 1:20:48.360]  And so they can show you images of that, oh, it's bigger than I thought.
[1:20:48.360 --> 1:20:56.440]  I said $1 billion, $300 billion, it's $1,391 million.
[1:20:56.440 --> 1:20:58.560]  And so, yeah, they're like, yeah, we got to lower the population.
[1:20:58.560 --> 1:21:02.040]  Well, they're trying to do that now here to us, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:21:02.040 --> 1:21:07.840]  They're importing third world populations that they control and now forcing the farmers
[1:21:07.840 --> 1:21:10.040]  off of the land.
[1:21:10.040 --> 1:21:11.040]  So let's continue.
[1:21:11.040 --> 1:21:17.800]  India coronavirus, bodies piling up at New Delhi crematoriums as human remains buried
[1:21:17.800 --> 1:21:20.160]  next to pavement.
[1:21:20.160 --> 1:21:23.560]  Open air cremationers, articles demonizing it saying they shouldn't do it, but CNN is
[1:21:23.560 --> 1:21:25.160]  telling you it's a new thing.
[1:21:25.160 --> 1:21:31.320]  India's burning issue with emissions from Hindu funerals, 95% of cremations in New Delhi
[1:21:31.320 --> 1:21:36.480]  still open air using wood, oh my gosh, evil wood.
[1:21:36.480 --> 1:21:39.720]  Hindu cremations, big breakdown of that from a university.
[1:21:39.720 --> 1:21:46.680]  This is the reality of how they lie to you at every single level.
[1:21:46.680 --> 1:21:51.240]  And yes, could we industrialize India, could we educate them, could we slow the increase
[1:21:51.240 --> 1:21:55.120]  in their population, is the earth not sustainable at some levels, absolutely.
[1:21:55.120 --> 1:21:59.000]  But the globalists are suppressing new technologies and the globalists fly around on their private
[1:21:59.000 --> 1:22:04.160]  jet airplanes and live lavish lifestyles and openly say they want to post human world,
[1:22:04.160 --> 1:22:09.840]  want to get rid of humans entirely and say we're a failed species because there's psychotics
[1:22:09.840 --> 1:22:14.000]  that have a bad attitude and are projecting their own self loathing onto us and are not
[1:22:14.000 --> 1:22:18.600]  the people to carry this out, even if you believe their arguments.
[1:22:18.600 --> 1:22:21.480]  These arguments are an excuse to carry this out.
[1:22:21.480 --> 1:22:24.640]  And so now you know why they're giving you the vaccines to sterilize you that aren't
[1:22:24.640 --> 1:22:25.640]  vaccines.
[1:22:25.640 --> 1:22:27.680]  Now you know why they're covering up the fact that it's killing so many.
[1:22:27.680 --> 1:22:31.080]  Now you know why they're euthanizing the old because there's an agreement between governments
[1:22:31.080 --> 1:22:37.640]  worldwide to kill the poor people and the old people and then use the fleeing poor that
[1:22:37.640 --> 1:22:46.400]  are starving the third world to then rush us or then organize and brought into the United
[1:22:46.400 --> 1:22:47.400]  States.
[1:22:47.400 --> 1:22:53.480]  And there's a National Geographic story from five years ago complaining about the big
[1:22:53.480 --> 1:22:58.200]  mass burning pits in the cities where they burned the people.
[1:22:58.200 --> 1:23:00.400]  Incredible.
[1:23:00.400 --> 1:23:01.400]  Not a new thing.
[1:23:01.400 --> 1:23:02.400]  CNN lying to you.
[1:23:02.400 --> 1:23:03.400]  But not just CNN.
[1:23:03.400 --> 1:23:05.160]  I typed in India, cremation.
[1:23:05.160 --> 1:23:12.440]  There were hundreds and CNN, ABC News, NBC News, National Geographic, NPR, just everyone
[1:23:12.440 --> 1:23:16.760]  reporting that it's the end of the world, openly burning bodies, blah, blah, blah.
[1:23:16.760 --> 1:23:17.760]  Covid's killing everybody.
[1:23:17.760 --> 1:23:18.760]  Oh my gosh.
[1:23:18.760 --> 1:23:19.760]  Works that we've ever seen in the world.
[1:23:19.760 --> 1:23:22.960]  And meanwhile, it's the mass starvation from a lockdown and a new one that's gone in.
[1:23:22.960 --> 1:23:24.680]  Let's just be honest.
[1:23:24.680 --> 1:23:28.600]  The globalists are murdering millions of Indians.
[1:23:28.600 --> 1:23:29.600]  Let's be honest.
[1:23:29.600 --> 1:23:31.800]  They're murdering millions of Africans.
[1:23:31.800 --> 1:23:32.800]  Let's be honest.
[1:23:32.800 --> 1:23:36.240]  They're murdering millions of Latin Americans and millions of Middle Easterners and millions
[1:23:36.240 --> 1:23:40.080]  of Asians and they're doing it and their argument is they're doing it to save the earth
[1:23:40.080 --> 1:23:45.120]  when the globalist-owned admission is a post-industrial world where they trigger the crisis, they
[1:23:45.120 --> 1:23:50.400]  trigger the collapse, and then bring in total world government with AI control, with combat
[1:23:50.400 --> 1:23:55.640]  robots policing us in a post-human planet, and where even the rich in America and the
[1:23:55.640 --> 1:24:02.040]  world will be made poor and only a tiny super elite will have wealth.
[1:24:02.040 --> 1:24:03.880]  The globalists say after all, that's fair.
[1:24:03.880 --> 1:24:06.560]  They're going to kill everybody when they're done.
[1:24:06.560 --> 1:24:11.680]  So I nominate Bill Gates and I nominate Prince Charles, who heads up the Great Reset, and
[1:24:11.680 --> 1:24:13.600]  Klaus Schwab, the Go First.
[1:24:13.600 --> 1:24:14.880]  I don't wish you any harm myself.
[1:24:14.880 --> 1:24:16.600]  I'm not calling for violence against you.
[1:24:16.600 --> 1:24:21.320]  I think Bill Gates should publicly hang himself.
[1:24:21.320 --> 1:24:23.800]  I think Prince Charles should publicly hang himself.
[1:24:23.800 --> 1:24:29.720]  I think Ted Turner should publicly hang himself, and if they would all go to one of their ranches
[1:24:29.720 --> 1:24:32.880]  and just have a public international thing and say, we want to kill you, we want to save
[1:24:32.880 --> 1:24:36.200]  the earth, we're going to start with ourselves, and if Bill Gates just took an ice pick and
[1:24:36.200 --> 1:24:41.480]  just started ramming at his throat, hey, humanity with blood spewing, I would say, well, I respect
[1:24:41.480 --> 1:24:42.480]  that man.
[1:24:42.480 --> 1:24:43.480]  Maybe he's right.
[1:24:43.480 --> 1:24:46.400]  Then we can have the drones launch with the nerve gas and start the operation, which is
[1:24:46.400 --> 1:24:49.440]  the final mop-up operation, which I told you about a long time ago, and now they're
[1:24:49.440 --> 1:24:50.440]  vetting it.
[1:24:50.440 --> 1:24:55.520]  The drones are ready with the nerve gas for you and your family, we'll be right back.
[1:24:55.520 --> 1:25:03.520]  Epic is one of only a handful of domain registers that promote free speech and freedom of association,
[1:25:03.520 --> 1:25:08.000]  and they know that Big Tech is buying up almost all the other major companies and engaging
[1:25:08.000 --> 1:25:11.440]  in massive censorship and organized crime racketeering.
[1:25:11.440 --> 1:25:14.400]  That's why they've been massively expanding their services.
[1:25:14.400 --> 1:25:18.200]  So whether you have domains or want to register a domain or want help building a website or
[1:25:18.200 --> 1:25:22.920]  want servers or any other major service, they've got it all and they're expanding.
[1:25:22.920 --> 1:25:28.680]  And if you go to infowarsdomains.com and follow that link, you get all their services at the
[1:25:28.680 --> 1:25:34.920]  lowest price and 25% of your signup for a new domain or a domain you move goes to fund
[1:25:34.920 --> 1:25:40.000]  the info war, and then we get 5% as well for any servers or any other type of services
[1:25:40.000 --> 1:25:41.000]  that you get from them.
[1:25:41.000 --> 1:25:45.440]  So it's a win-win as we build a true open free internet again, because the globalists
[1:25:45.440 --> 1:25:47.880]  are destroying what was open and what was free.
[1:25:47.880 --> 1:25:55.920]  So infowarsdomains.com, the revolution starts there, infowarsdomains.com, take action now.
[1:25:55.920 --> 1:25:58.840]  I 1 trillion percent believe what I'm saying.
[1:25:58.840 --> 1:26:00.720]  Hell, everybody knows that.
[1:26:00.720 --> 1:26:02.200]  I just tell you what I'm really thinking.
[1:26:02.200 --> 1:26:04.520]  People say, well, Jones, why the hell did you just say that on air?
[1:26:04.520 --> 1:26:05.520]  That's embarrassing.
[1:26:05.520 --> 1:26:09.640]  Well, I'm not going to stop with only the good stuff about me, but I'll tell you this
[1:26:09.640 --> 1:26:13.000]  right now, you're nuts if you don't get storeable food.
[1:26:13.000 --> 1:26:17.160]  And I've got the biggest best sponsor with the highest quality food at the lowest price
[1:26:17.160 --> 1:26:18.160]  you're going to find.
[1:26:18.160 --> 1:26:22.800]  Can you spend triple or four times it and get like gourmet stuff that tastes even better?
[1:26:22.800 --> 1:26:23.800]  Yeah.
[1:26:23.800 --> 1:26:24.800]  Most of the stuff tastes amazing.
[1:26:24.800 --> 1:26:25.800]  Some of it tastes okay.
[1:26:25.800 --> 1:26:29.520]  The point is, it's high quality, it's nutritious, and it lasts a long time.
[1:26:29.520 --> 1:26:33.040]  And compared to other competitors, they can't even get close.
[1:26:33.040 --> 1:26:34.560]  We've got three months, six months.
[1:26:34.560 --> 1:26:39.920]  Other suppliers right now, and I clisped their arms so hard to give you 10 percent off again,
[1:26:39.920 --> 1:26:47.440]  because you're so conditionally buying a Supercell, we're doing it one more time, infowarstore.com,
[1:26:47.440 --> 1:26:53.080]  infowarstore.com, 10 percent off the entire catalog of my favorite supply.
[1:26:53.080 --> 1:26:55.080]  Get ready while you still can.
[1:26:55.080 --> 1:27:10.440]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[1:27:10.440 --> 1:27:23.320]  Infowars has been banned, arrested, attacked and threatened, because we are effective.
[1:27:23.320 --> 1:27:33.200]  The great awakening is here, go to banned.video, download the videos and share.
[1:27:33.200 --> 1:27:49.320]  Support the information war at infowarstore.com and never give up the fight.
[1:27:49.320 --> 1:28:01.320]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:12:02.260 --> 1:29:15.160]  and you've got people like Bill Gates that thinks he's saving the planet,
[1:29:15.160 --> 1:29:21.560]  dumping us down, poisoning us with fluoride, GMO, mutating our genetics, destroying our
[1:29:21.560 --> 1:29:22.560]  future.
[1:29:22.560 --> 1:29:27.960]  And at the very end or the beginning of their takeover operation, they admit, we want to
[1:29:27.960 --> 1:29:30.960]  post human world entirely.
[1:29:30.960 --> 1:29:34.160]  We pray to the God of death.
[1:29:34.160 --> 1:29:39.360]  Again, I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[1:29:39.360 --> 1:29:47.800]  I am very, very thankful that you have joined us here on this live Monday broadcast.
[1:29:47.800 --> 1:29:55.880]  And I want to illustrate what's happening in the third world.
[1:29:55.880 --> 1:30:01.880]  The engineered collapse, the engineered starvation, the engineered war, the engineered death versus
[1:30:01.880 --> 1:30:11.520]  Hollywood and the left and all the rest of them, the big banks, the big media, the big
[1:30:11.520 --> 1:30:19.240]  tech giving $10.6 billion to black lives matter groups as a smokescreen, what did Brandon
[1:30:19.240 --> 1:30:20.240]  Tatum say?
[1:30:20.240 --> 1:30:25.000]  He did a great job on the British program just a few days ago.
[1:30:25.000 --> 1:30:29.720]  In fact, maybe I didn't watch the show last night, I know I sent it over to Owen.
[1:30:29.720 --> 1:30:34.440]  You guys grab that Brandon Tatum clip that I sent over to the show yesterday, please.
[1:30:34.440 --> 1:30:35.440]  He was on British TV.
[1:30:35.440 --> 1:30:36.440]  Thanks.
[1:30:36.440 --> 1:30:39.800]  I want to play that next segment.
[1:30:39.800 --> 1:30:43.360]  They said they've ridden in on a wave of dead black people.
[1:30:43.360 --> 1:30:44.360]  That's what Joe Biden's done.
[1:30:44.360 --> 1:30:46.080]  That's what they've all done.
[1:30:46.080 --> 1:30:47.080]  That's absolutely true.
[1:30:47.080 --> 1:30:52.040]  And so they use a few dozen black people, maybe shot wrong or whatever, okay, I'm sad
[1:30:52.040 --> 1:30:54.040]  about that.
[1:30:54.040 --> 1:30:58.880]  To cover up massive killing of old people, massive killing of people, period all over
[1:30:58.880 --> 1:31:07.080]  the world, but particularly in Africa and you try to tell some virtue signaling left
[1:31:07.080 --> 1:31:14.080]  us that and they'll just laugh at you because they don't care about really being nice or
[1:31:14.080 --> 1:31:16.600]  being good.
[1:31:16.600 --> 1:31:22.640]  They only care about playing us off against each other so these globalists can steal the
[1:31:22.640 --> 1:31:28.280]  future and all these PR people and media people and tech people are auditioning for
[1:31:28.280 --> 1:31:33.840]  the globalist to be kinsmen in the future nightmare dystopia.
[1:31:33.840 --> 1:31:35.960]  They know there's an extermination coming.
[1:31:35.960 --> 1:31:38.200]  They know there's a depopulation coming.
[1:31:38.200 --> 1:31:45.760]  They know the one world governments here and they are all auditioning to Satan to try to
[1:31:45.760 --> 1:31:51.640]  prove how good they are in the implementation of this mass culling that Prince Philip called
[1:31:51.640 --> 1:31:54.520]  for in five different interviews.
[1:31:54.520 --> 1:32:00.120]  So they're going to tell you they're taking your guns and your free speech and your privacy
[1:32:00.120 --> 1:32:01.120]  for diversity.
[1:32:01.120 --> 1:32:04.520]  They're going to tell you they're getting rid of your borders for diversity.
[1:32:04.520 --> 1:32:07.520]  They're going to tell you they're brainwashing your kids for diversity.
[1:32:07.520 --> 1:32:10.000]  They're going to tell you they're running your life for diversity but really they're
[1:32:10.000 --> 1:32:15.720]  enslaving you with ruthless mega corporations and communist China and all of its mass murder
[1:32:15.720 --> 1:32:18.720]  is the model.
[1:32:18.720 --> 1:32:22.040]  So let's start playing some of these clips.
[1:32:22.040 --> 1:32:28.680]  This is Regina King some actress that won an Oscar who's all pissed off up there.
[1:32:28.680 --> 1:32:31.840]  The angry look at face because she's a good person and she's up against those bad white
[1:32:31.840 --> 1:32:32.840]  people.
[1:32:32.840 --> 1:32:37.560]  And I tell you if there hadn't been the proper ruling she'd have been putting her boots
[1:32:37.560 --> 1:32:40.040]  on to march against those white people.
[1:32:40.040 --> 1:32:44.600]  She'll never march against Bill Gates or Holly which never actually stand up for any black
[1:32:44.600 --> 1:32:45.600]  people.
[1:32:45.600 --> 1:32:49.440]  No she'll just make millions of dollars and wear fancy $5,000 dresses and drive around
[1:32:49.440 --> 1:32:54.840]  in Ferraris and fly around in private jets and then bitch about evil America that produced
[1:32:54.840 --> 1:32:58.720]  so much wealth she lives like this while Africans are starving to death by the tens of thousands
[1:32:58.720 --> 1:32:59.720]  every day.
[1:32:59.720 --> 1:33:02.560]  But she's not going to go to Africa and see how they live.
[1:33:02.560 --> 1:33:05.080]  She's not going to go help anybody like the Christian missionaries.
[1:33:05.080 --> 1:33:06.080]  No.
[1:33:06.080 --> 1:33:10.800]  She's going to sit around and bitch about some cop making $52,000 a year.
[1:33:10.800 --> 1:33:11.800]  Here she is.
[1:33:11.800 --> 1:33:19.280]  It has been quite a year and we are still smack dab in the middle of it.
[1:33:19.280 --> 1:33:24.520]  We are mourning the loss of so many and I have to be honest if things have gone differently
[1:33:24.520 --> 1:33:30.760]  this past week in Minneapolis I might have traded in my heels for marching boots.
[1:33:30.760 --> 1:33:37.840]  Now I know that a lot of you people at home want to reach for your remote when you feel
[1:33:37.840 --> 1:33:44.160]  like Hollywood is preaching to you but as a mother of a black son I know the fear that
[1:33:44.160 --> 1:33:53.200]  so many live with and no amount of fame or fortune changes that.
[1:33:53.200 --> 1:33:57.400]  So 14 black men wrongfully shot by the police a year it's the rarest way for a black man
[1:33:57.400 --> 1:34:02.320]  to die more than half of black men dying their mother's womb getting chopped up but she doesn't
[1:34:02.320 --> 1:34:07.760]  say anything about that because she's so good she's an actress they tell her what to say
[1:34:07.760 --> 1:34:11.840]  to divert while they're killing everybody that's what's so sick about this oh we got
[1:34:11.840 --> 1:34:16.480]  to help India they're dying over there because we starving to death oh we have to march on
[1:34:16.480 --> 1:34:20.800]  the white people and burn down our own neighborhoods.
[1:34:20.800 --> 1:34:24.560]  Here's another one of the idiots up there getting an award telling people that there's
[1:34:24.560 --> 1:34:29.160]  an epidemic and disproportionately police shoot black men when it's actually the other
[1:34:29.160 --> 1:34:31.480]  way around here it is.
[1:34:31.480 --> 1:34:36.520]  On average the police in America every day killed three people which amounts to about
[1:34:36.520 --> 1:34:43.880]  a thousand people a year and those people happen to disproportionately black people
[1:34:43.880 --> 1:34:49.840]  and you know James Baldwin once said the most despicable thing a person can be is indifferent
[1:34:49.840 --> 1:34:58.200]  to other people's pain and so I just ask that you please not be indifferent please don't
[1:34:58.200 --> 1:35:00.440]  be indifferent.
[1:35:00.440 --> 1:35:05.520]  I mean that guy's literally up there wearing a clown suit he goes police shoot three people
[1:35:05.520 --> 1:35:14.200]  a day the police shoot kill a thousand people a year I mean how many black babies they abort
[1:35:14.200 --> 1:35:20.120]  a day thousands he doesn't give a damn it's a bunch of Hollywood pedophiles that scum
[1:35:20.120 --> 1:35:28.280]  up there shaking their asses hiding behind black people and you've got all these Oscar
[1:35:28.280 --> 1:35:33.520]  winners up there bitching and complaining when millions of people are starving to death
[1:35:33.520 --> 1:35:38.440]  every few months from the COVID lockdown and a new one's on in India but you don't care
[1:35:38.440 --> 1:35:42.520]  because it's not the prescribed thing you're supposed to say.

[1:41:58.120 --> 1:42:11.640]  listening to the alex jones show
[1:42:28.120 --> 1:42:42.000]  earlier today i heard a clip from american journal the harrison smith house we did morning
[1:42:42.000 --> 1:42:48.040]  stadium here on the info wars network in blustin galloch jones we just tuned in i'm here 11
[1:42:48.040 --> 1:42:56.400]  a.m. to 3 p.m. weekdays ahead of the war room with oman shroyer 3 to 6 p.m. and he was
[1:42:56.400 --> 1:43:06.520]  talking about the fact that i get upset i get angry well yeah because if we know the
[1:43:06.520 --> 1:43:11.080]  globalists are starving hundreds of millions of people to the edge of death over 10 million
[1:43:11.080 --> 1:43:15.720]  that you admit starved to death that number is a four or five months old in just the last
[1:43:15.720 --> 1:43:20.400]  year and india has millions starved to death and it's even in the news but then they go
[1:43:20.400 --> 1:43:26.520]  oh look the people are dying from covid and they're dying from starvation it's even in
[1:43:26.520 --> 1:43:31.840]  the u.n. literature they admit they're down starvation and malnutrition then they say
[1:43:31.840 --> 1:43:37.200]  they died of covid and then that gets india aid which isn't used actually save the people
[1:43:37.200 --> 1:43:44.800]  and a lot of folks will then say well there's too many people but who are you to sign on
[1:43:44.800 --> 1:43:50.640]  to that and kill these people folks and again the left and the and the minions of the globalist
[1:43:50.640 --> 1:43:56.640]  they always pretend like they're part of the power structure like you're playing god the
[1:43:56.640 --> 1:44:02.360]  average leftist knows the virus is overblown they know the massacre hoax they are part
[1:44:02.360 --> 1:44:12.320]  of the guild of power and they believe they're bringing in a utopia through all of this that's
[1:44:12.320 --> 1:44:17.520]  how many evil people we've got in this country and in this world that have actively joined
[1:44:17.520 --> 1:44:24.280]  with the bad guys now i just played if you just joined us just some of the ridiculousness
[1:44:24.280 --> 1:44:29.760]  or i've got like a five minute compilation of black oscar winners tearing down america
[1:44:29.760 --> 1:44:33.840]  tearing down white people talking about war talking about the epidemic of blacks being
[1:44:33.840 --> 1:44:37.560]  killed by police you mean the media grabs the few instances and runs it over and over
[1:44:37.560 --> 1:44:42.720]  again and i'm not going to play this whole press conference but i did watch the whole
[1:44:42.720 --> 1:44:49.040]  15 minute video this morning and they're asking the black sergeant who's talking about the
[1:44:49.040 --> 1:44:53.680]  white cop that shot the black guy that had two butcher knives running at him casing him
[1:44:53.680 --> 1:45:00.440]  down the street if the officer needs to be charged the media is like shouldn't he have
[1:45:00.440 --> 1:45:06.200]  used his taser and then the press conference cop goes well no it's actually a lethal weapon
[1:45:06.200 --> 1:45:10.960]  you don't want to do that yeah somebody ran me with two big butcher knives and then i'm
[1:45:10.960 --> 1:45:14.680]  going to taste her on most of the time it sticks in the clothing so i can die so i can
[1:45:14.680 --> 1:45:22.040]  virtue signal random tatum is a former police officer makes the point we have an issue with
[1:45:22.040 --> 1:45:27.800]  people going crazy white black you name it people taking bas salts and literally eating
[1:45:27.800 --> 1:45:32.520]  their neighbors all sorts of mental illness is exploding we're becoming demonic we're
[1:45:32.520 --> 1:45:40.080]  falling apart they pull over a car it's got fake plates on it it's probably stolen before
[1:45:40.080 --> 1:45:45.520]  you do anything a guy with butcher knives jumps out tries to pull the driver out the cop thinks
[1:45:45.520 --> 1:45:49.640]  it must be a car jack he may they don't they don't know the facts yet just stolen Mercedes
[1:45:49.640 --> 1:45:56.520]  it looks like and then he tries to get breaking the cop car the cop starts running from him
[1:45:56.520 --> 1:46:04.640]  like 30 40 feet back and the crazy black dude chases the cop with butcher knife and the media
[1:46:04.640 --> 1:46:10.560]  is like well maybe you should get in trouble and the media is still trying to cover up
[1:46:10.560 --> 1:46:17.160]  what happened in columbus with the crazy black girl this is the breakdown of society but
[1:46:17.160 --> 1:46:20.880]  there's plenty of crazy videos of white people going crazy in hispanics going crazy but the
[1:46:20.880 --> 1:46:25.720]  point is when a black person goes crazy and the cops shoot him it's the end of the world
[1:46:25.720 --> 1:46:33.040]  here is the video and audio of what just happened national cop fatally shoots a man charging
[1:46:33.040 --> 1:47:02.360]  him with two giant butcher knives here it is
[1:47:02.360 --> 1:47:16.320]  I have seen at least 10 videos the last few months of black people charging police with
[1:47:16.320 --> 1:47:20.400]  butcher knives I mean this guy could have run to the neighborhood he first he tries
[1:47:20.400 --> 1:47:26.600]  to steal the police car then he charges the cop who's running from him who kills him and
[1:47:26.600 --> 1:47:31.120]  the media by the way once the cops said who would take a job like that where you're supposed
[1:47:31.120 --> 1:47:35.320]  to pull over cars that have fake license plates you pull them over and a crazy guy pops out
[1:47:35.320 --> 1:47:40.320]  like jack in the box with with two butcher knives and starts chasing you like he's
[1:47:40.320 --> 1:47:45.800]  freddy kruger or jason from friday the 13th this is the mass mental illness brandon tatum
[1:47:45.800 --> 1:47:50.200]  was on national british television and not tell the park he is going to be joining us
[1:47:50.200 --> 1:47:55.920]  next week here it is mr larry there right we can speak now to brandon tatum a former
[1:47:55.920 --> 1:48:02.760]  police officer and found as the officer tatum thank you very much for coming on the program
[1:48:02.760 --> 1:48:06.520]  my pleasure so we're going to talk about lots of the wider issues just in a moment but first
[1:48:06.520 --> 1:48:12.840]  of all just wanted to get your reaction to the conviction well first of all I think most
[1:48:12.840 --> 1:48:19.080]  of what I heard on the broadcast all the way here is confusing to me I think we're living
[1:48:19.080 --> 1:48:23.960]  in the twilight zone this conviction and my personal opinion did nothing for our country
[1:48:23.960 --> 1:48:29.880]  I mean people are living a lot I mean this was one police officer one person in the community
[1:48:29.880 --> 1:48:34.080]  they found him guilty this was the swiftest justice I've ever seen in my life the day
[1:48:34.080 --> 1:48:39.200]  after the film came out he was arrested he was tried 10 hours of deliberation he was
[1:48:39.200 --> 1:48:45.120]  convicted I'm not I'm not really sure why people are acting like this month this is monumental
[1:48:45.120 --> 1:48:50.000]  also he did not get a fair trial in my personal opinion there was a lot of obstruction that
[1:48:50.000 --> 1:48:54.600]  happened they paid the family out 27 million before the jury could be selected I mean they're
[1:48:54.600 --> 1:48:59.120]  going to have a case in appeal so I don't know why people are celebrating and I don't
[1:48:59.120 --> 1:49:02.720]  know why this is such a big focal point other than people are making money off of the pain
[1:49:02.720 --> 1:49:08.560]  of people in our country so you you're objecting firstly to some of the things that happened
[1:49:08.560 --> 1:49:12.360]  around the trial which now that there is a conviction I think we should probably park
[1:49:12.360 --> 1:49:18.920]  that but secondly you're upset that there's a amalgamation here of a wider sense of a
[1:49:18.920 --> 1:49:26.400]  landmark case and this one specific court case yeah this is not a landmark case I think
[1:49:26.400 --> 1:49:31.720]  people are this is a political agenda they're pushing lies in our country policing in America
[1:49:31.720 --> 1:49:36.200]  is not inherently racist we don't live in a racist country this was an interaction between
[1:49:36.200 --> 1:49:40.880]  a police officer that I thought did the wrong thing and a black man who was on drugs high
[1:49:40.880 --> 1:49:46.160]  resisting arrest and ended up being killed by that police officer that's as simple as
[1:49:46.160 --> 1:49:51.560]  it can be the president of the United States got out and made a fool of himself trying to
[1:49:51.560 --> 1:49:58.520]  promote racism in a simple a police encounter that the officer got convicted on so you would
[1:49:58.520 --> 1:50:03.560]  you reject you would you reject president Biden's comments about systemic racism and
[1:50:03.560 --> 1:50:09.160]  it being a stain on the whole nation yes president Biden is an idiot in my personal
[1:50:09.160 --> 1:50:14.440]  opinion and he's just talking because he's a politician systemic racism I mean if you
[1:50:14.440 --> 1:50:19.960]  look at Joe Biden himself you know he spoke at a Ku Klux Klan members funeral and did
[1:50:19.960 --> 1:50:26.000]  the eulogy of Robert Byrd I mean he is white supremacy and racism if you if you want to
[1:50:26.000 --> 1:50:29.920]  want to say that is the case and now he's the president so if he really cared about white
[1:50:29.920 --> 1:50:34.440]  supremacy and racism he should step down as the president because he's an exemplification
[1:50:34.440 --> 1:50:39.160]  of that very thing these people are just running their mouth and they're not being honest we
[1:50:39.160 --> 1:50:43.880]  don't have a problem with racism in our country we have a problem with people not following
[1:50:43.880 --> 1:50:48.440]  the law we also have a problem with politicians making up things so they can get reelected
[1:50:48.440 --> 1:50:51.880]  and that's exactly what has been happening that's why you never see anything change
[1:50:51.880 --> 1:50:55.520]  all right the full video is up on info wars dot com that's right foreign corporations
[1:50:55.520 --> 1:50:59.920]  are polluting the nation we're falling apart and they'll use a few sad mistakes and a few
[1:50:59.920 --> 1:51:04.480]  things that go wrong to try to create racial division as a distraction from what's going
[1:51:04.480 --> 1:51:08.160]  on but I'll tell you something they admit that they're encouraging homelessness and
[1:51:08.160 --> 1:51:12.880]  drug use to break down society so that as the financial collapse happens the public will
[1:51:12.880 --> 1:51:17.000]  put up with it we're being prepared for total collapse the CIA has had leaked documents on
[1:51:17.000 --> 1:51:23.920]  that today driving to work there are now homeless camps on every major highway on both sides
[1:51:23.920 --> 1:51:28.400]  everywhere and I was looking at the homeless camps I was driving here to the office and
[1:51:28.400 --> 1:51:33.080]  I saw crazy looking white people and I'm not giving black people a pass I'm just saying
[1:51:33.080 --> 1:51:40.360]  talk about crazy I saw a guy drop like a Folgers can on 290 some crazy old white dude climbs
[1:51:40.360 --> 1:51:44.400]  down in the highway almost gets run over on the other side of the church crawling back
[1:51:44.400 --> 1:51:51.960]  up the embankment looked like day of the dead looks like a zombie apocalypse that's what
[1:51:51.960 --> 1:51:55.920]  the cops deal with all day I would want to be a cop during the collapse of America but
[1:51:55.920 --> 1:52:01.560]  it gets worse they want everybody's guns during this collapse so we can't protect ourselves
[1:52:01.560 --> 1:52:05.880]  while the Democrats all have private bodyguards and secret service and the FBI and federal
[1:52:05.880 --> 1:52:12.680]  marshals and they live behind big fences with the National Guard by the way this footage
[1:52:12.680 --> 1:52:17.040]  I keep we keep showing this is nothing I'm going to go out with a camera I can go out
[1:52:17.040 --> 1:52:25.120]  for an hour and I can show you 10,000 tents in in in what do they call that time lapse
[1:52:25.120 --> 1:52:29.640]  and you have to take an hour time lapse drive around Austin I mean there's so many damn
[1:52:29.640 --> 1:52:33.560]  homeless people here's the deal these aren't like hobos are just drunks or people down
[1:52:33.560 --> 1:52:37.120]  and out or veterans they are out of their mind on hardcore drugs running around like
[1:52:37.120 --> 1:52:44.760]  day of the dead zombie civilization is collapsing we're a demon possessed nation I'm up here
[1:52:44.760 --> 1:52:50.600]  working on a Thursday night in mid-April 2021 and I just want to say something I am so blessed
[1:52:50.600 --> 1:52:54.680]  and honored to work with this incredible crew that has come together over the years and
[1:52:54.680 --> 1:52:59.080]  is truly an answer to prayer and I am so blessed and thankful for all of you the listeners of
[1:52:59.080 --> 1:53:03.640]  the show I want you to know that I love you and I appreciate you whether you are old whether
[1:53:03.640 --> 1:53:07.760]  you are Hispanic white black it doesn't matter you got red blood and if you love freedom
[1:53:07.760 --> 1:53:13.000]  and justice and if you love our innocent children we are brothers and sisters together
[1:53:13.000 --> 1:53:17.560]  and it has just been an incredible experience to work with you over the years and it's
[1:53:17.560 --> 1:53:22.720]  crazy your things are I want to keep working in the future but again that's really up to
[1:53:22.720 --> 1:53:28.320]  you and up to God so please I hope God works through you and put some message in your heart
[1:53:28.320 --> 1:53:32.240]  to support us again that's up to you and your relationship with God I just want to thank
[1:53:32.240 --> 1:53:37.040]  you all for the years of support you've given us and what you've done and just ask you again
[1:53:37.040 --> 1:53:41.360]  to pray to God and ask what God's vision is for you and hopefully God will touch your
[1:53:41.360 --> 1:53:46.000]  heart to continue to support him for worse God bless.
[1:53:46.000 --> 1:53:52.960]  As negative as times are right now and as depressing as things can be you have to understand
[1:53:52.960 --> 1:54:00.280]  that this is all a test this experience this life on this planet is a reckoning.
[1:54:00.280 --> 1:54:05.720]  It's God giving us a chance to work things out the third dimension so we can decide where
[1:54:05.720 --> 1:54:10.040]  we want to spend eternity and what level we want to go to and it really does come down
[1:54:10.040 --> 1:54:14.600]  to that so as sad as things are and as evil as things are look at all the good in the
[1:54:14.600 --> 1:54:20.040]  world as well and realize that God is the author of our consciousness God is the author
[1:54:20.040 --> 1:54:27.160]  of us having our own will God is the author of us having free will and that free will
[1:54:27.160 --> 1:54:31.000]  is a beautiful thing and when you look at mainstream media in Hollywood and this whole
[1:54:31.000 --> 1:54:37.160]  evil culture in Washington DC and Fauci and the and the mass cult it's all about dominating
[1:54:37.160 --> 1:54:41.240]  your free will it's all about telling you you're dirty you're ugly you're in bed because
[1:54:41.240 --> 1:54:49.200]  Satan hates you because you're made in the image of God the creator of the universe.
[1:54:49.200 --> 1:55:18.880]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show big brother mainstream media
[1:55:18.880 --> 1:55:26.720]  government cover-ups you want to stop tyranny well so does he live from the info wars dot
[1:55:26.720 --> 1:55:34.920]  com studios it's Alex Jones as the newsweek committee it's a beautiful thing the destruction
[1:55:34.920 --> 1:56:04.320]  of words the slow decay of individual identity and the cancer of guilt in a society losing
[1:56:04.320 --> 1:56:09.520]  its grip on free speech is spiraling out of control you may recall when leaders in the
[1:56:09.520 --> 1:56:14.840]  house of representatives announced a rule package for the 117th congress that included
[1:56:14.840 --> 1:56:20.720]  a proposal to use gender inclusive language and eliminated gendered terms such as father
[1:56:20.720 --> 1:56:26.840]  mother son daughter etc on page five of the forty five page package strike chairman and
[1:56:26.840 --> 1:56:36.600]  insert chair on page six strike father mother son daughter brother sister husband wife father
[1:56:36.600 --> 1:56:45.040]  in law or mother in law and insert parent child sibling spouse or parent in law and
[1:56:45.040 --> 1:56:51.000]  then strike himself or herself and insert themself the house democratic caucus chair
[1:56:51.000 --> 1:56:57.000]  was asked about the new language gender neutral language is just consistent to reflect the
[1:56:57.000 --> 1:57:01.640]  gorgeous mosaic of the American people in the most sensitive fashion possible peace even
[1:57:01.640 --> 1:57:09.320]  in this chamber now and evermore we ask it in the name of the monotheistic God Brahma
[1:57:09.320 --> 1:57:19.200]  and God known by many names by many different faiths a man and a woman removing references
[1:57:19.200 --> 1:57:25.560]  to you know mothers and fathers brothers and sisters sons and daughters from congressional
[1:57:25.560 --> 1:57:32.200]  rules and administration it's mind blowing because it shows just how out of touch with
[1:57:32.200 --> 1:57:38.600]  reality and the struggles of everyday Americans people in congress are instead of doing something
[1:57:38.600 --> 1:57:43.960]  that could actually help save people's lives they're choosing instead to say well you can't
[1:57:43.960 --> 1:57:50.240]  say mother or father in any of this congressional language it's it's astounding well now the
[1:57:50.240 --> 1:57:56.920]  biden administration and all of its neocultural marxist lunacy has decided that instead of
[1:57:56.920 --> 1:58:02.320]  illegal aliens which was still being used by some government officials and press releases
[1:58:02.320 --> 1:58:07.880]  and elsewhere border patrol and ice should now instead use undocumented non-citizen or
[1:58:07.880 --> 1:58:13.240]  undocumented individual according to the memos this from the washington times so what we've
[1:58:13.240 --> 1:58:17.720]  doing is we're putting together an entire organizational structure so that within seven
[1:58:17.720 --> 1:58:22.800]  days or maybe like you get in the phone contact that number find out whether there is a mother
[1:58:22.800 --> 1:58:29.360]  or a father the term alien has been used in the united states at least since the alien
[1:58:29.360 --> 1:58:36.320]  and sedition act of 1798 and as the dictionary continues to get smaller according to the
[1:58:36.320 --> 1:58:41.400]  word police over at the source dot com you can no longer refer to your iguana or your
[1:58:41.400 --> 1:58:47.640]  pet goldfish as your spirit animal due to cultural appropriation throwing the term guru around
[1:58:47.640 --> 1:58:53.240]  is now highly offensive to buddhist and hindu's according to the source dot com and the same
[1:58:53.240 --> 1:58:58.880]  goes for ninja nazi and sherpa because we aren't taking their origins serious enough
[1:58:58.880 --> 1:59:04.280]  and forget about binge watching a binging is highly offensive to people with serious
[1:59:04.280 --> 1:59:10.120]  eating disorders if they can police the words you use they can change the way you think
[1:59:10.120 --> 1:59:15.720]  and if we let this happen eventually the word freedom which is the basis of our republic
[1:59:15.720 --> 1:59:24.240]  will be on the chopping block john bound reporting this is a systemic systematic assault on reality
[1:59:24.240 --> 1:59:53.560]  from the front lines of the information war it's alex jones

[2:01:19.080 --> 2:01:36.640]  jones i've been interviewing my cat it's gotta be more than 12 years or so maybe 14 years
[2:01:36.640 --> 2:01:45.360]  naturalnews.com a lot of other great news sites as well he also owns a big food and product
[2:01:45.360 --> 2:01:50.440]  testing facility here in central texas and a farm he's a good friend of mine a smart
[2:01:50.440 --> 2:01:57.280]  guy people don't really need to have him introduced to them but there is so much that we're going
[2:01:57.280 --> 2:02:04.120]  to be talking about with him today but the first thing i want to get to is just a larger
[2:02:04.120 --> 2:02:16.960]  overview a larger overview of the covid lockdowns the breakdown of civilization the lockdowns
[2:02:16.960 --> 2:02:22.400]  they admit causing 1020 times the starvation the covid is causing death and what he thinks
[2:02:22.400 --> 2:02:29.480]  they're going to do next because as it comes out that the vaccines don't work and are causing
[2:02:29.480 --> 2:02:37.080]  mutations and are causing real viral shedding of really dangerous covid viruses how do they
[2:02:37.080 --> 2:02:40.800]  think they're going to get away with that well i believe with another crisis even bigger
[2:02:40.800 --> 2:02:45.480]  that's how they normally do it but but clearly we've gone over the edge they're fully committed
[2:02:45.480 --> 2:02:49.960]  to their operations and just how many people are dying to take the vaccines that aren't
[2:02:49.960 --> 2:02:56.720]  vaccines and just all the craziness wow we are really inside the new world order now
[2:02:56.720 --> 2:03:03.520]  and then also we've got a new story out that's at naturalnews.com it's also on info wars.com
[2:03:03.520 --> 2:03:13.000]  health ranger post new micro photos of covid swabs covid masks mysterious red and blue
[2:03:13.000 --> 2:03:20.320]  fibers and others have scanned them and found similar weird things that appear to be well
[2:03:20.320 --> 2:03:26.280]  not appear they are moving and then there's also german researchers have tested what's
[2:03:26.280 --> 2:03:30.960]  in the Pfizer shot and there's have things moving around in it and and so we're going
[2:03:30.960 --> 2:03:35.560]  to get a hold of some samples and work with some labs like my gathams to test this themselves
[2:03:35.560 --> 2:03:43.080]  but clearly this is getting weirder and weirder and stranger and stranger and we got all these
[2:03:43.080 --> 2:03:47.240]  studies the mass cracks and causing all sorts of diseases my gathams thank you so much for
[2:03:47.240 --> 2:03:53.720]  joining us what do you want to tackle first well well first of all alex it's very clear
[2:03:53.720 --> 2:04:00.000]  that there is an extermination agenda that's been unleashed against humanity and so every
[2:04:00.000 --> 2:04:06.960]  element of this covid pandemic has been weaponized the vaccines are bio weapons the original
[2:04:06.960 --> 2:04:13.000]  covid which was designed to have a high transmission rate was also a bio weapon but the real weapon
[2:04:13.000 --> 2:04:17.960]  is the vaccines and now it's clear they're going to repeat this they're going to say
[2:04:17.960 --> 2:04:23.440]  well your original vaccine expires now those of you who signed up for a vaccine passport
[2:04:23.440 --> 2:04:27.960]  the government has tracked you but now that that vaccine has expired so they're going
[2:04:27.960 --> 2:04:33.480]  to require a booster shot to handle the new strains the new mutants well the strains and
[2:04:33.480 --> 2:04:39.840]  the mutants are being created by people who get vaccinated you know so they're shedding
[2:04:39.840 --> 2:04:44.680]  all these different strains and that's then being targeted by the vaccine company and
[2:04:44.680 --> 2:04:48.800]  by the way you were the first people to say that a year ago even npr the new york times
[2:04:48.800 --> 2:04:55.920]  admit it's it's creating new strains it's insane yeah well and and I want to I want
[2:04:55.920 --> 2:05:02.000]  to say something really important here if they had done nothing no vaccines no masks
[2:05:02.000 --> 2:05:07.000]  no lockdowns no social distancing this thing would have already been over because natural
[2:05:07.000 --> 2:05:11.040]  innate immunity would have already conquered this people would be healthier we wouldn't
[2:05:11.040 --> 2:05:15.600]  have all the suicides of children we wouldn't have all the bailout money the tens of billions
[2:05:15.600 --> 2:05:20.560]  of dollars to the vaccine companies it's it is in fact the vaccines that are perpetuating
[2:05:20.560 --> 2:05:26.200]  this pandemic on purpose while they lock us down and they crush human economies crush
[2:05:26.200 --> 2:05:31.080]  the human spirit and crush humanity and this by the way Alex I know you've covered this
[2:05:31.080 --> 2:05:36.960]  combine this with the engineered food scarcity that is now accelerating across the world
[2:05:36.960 --> 2:05:43.480]  this is designed to starve people into begging for FEMA camps where the real extermination
[2:05:43.480 --> 2:05:48.040]  acceleration takes place and I'm not going to mince words here not on your show you know
[2:05:48.040 --> 2:05:52.960]  this is a an extermination agenda against humanity and if we don't rise up peacefully
[2:05:52.960 --> 2:05:58.480]  and stop this they will enslave us all and they will kill billions of people on this
[2:05:58.480 --> 2:06:02.000]  planet which they admit is a plan so let's tackle that let's tackle that the five minutes
[2:06:02.000 --> 2:06:07.480]  before break the UN admits the covid lockdowns causing 1020 times of starvation they admit
[2:06:07.480 --> 2:06:11.120]  that it's really mass starvation killing people in India explain how this artificial
[2:06:11.120 --> 2:06:15.240]  food scarcity works Bill Gates buying up all the farmland trying to outlaw beef what's
[2:06:15.240 --> 2:06:22.080]  going on well they have to drive people into the FEMA camps and into destitution and desperation
[2:06:22.080 --> 2:06:28.360]  they're going to use palm scanning mark of the beast grocery store tracking systems to
[2:06:28.360 --> 2:06:33.440]  give you your allowable quota of food purchases this is being experimented on right now in
[2:06:33.440 --> 2:06:38.440]  the Seattle area by Whole Foods owned by of course Bezos so it's going to be market the
[2:06:38.440 --> 2:06:45.080]  beast and if you don't agree to take the vaccines your food quota will be reduced so it's worse
[2:06:45.080 --> 2:06:50.040]  than Venezuela they will require you to take your shots or they will starve you to death
[2:06:50.040 --> 2:06:54.760]  unless you can grow your own food or do home hydroponics or gorilla gardening or food storage
[2:06:54.760 --> 2:06:59.480]  or something like that right so this is the plan they know that that if they if they can
[2:06:59.480 --> 2:07:05.480]  drive people into a destitution homelessness and also joblessness because of the economic
[2:07:05.480 --> 2:07:10.480]  shutdowns and the lockdowns then they can control people and exterminate them and by
[2:07:10.480 --> 2:07:16.920]  the way the infertility effects of the vaccines are now beginning to explode have you seen
[2:07:16.920 --> 2:07:23.680]  the stories of women who are having insane menstruation cycles effects you know incredible
[2:07:23.680 --> 2:07:27.440]  bleeding because of what's happening after these vaccines they're having spontaneous
[2:07:27.440 --> 2:07:31.920]  abortions they're having infertility they're no longer able to have babies that's in addition
[2:07:31.920 --> 2:07:35.800]  to the deaths that are being caused by the vaccines directly with another major death
[2:07:35.800 --> 2:07:40.760]  wave coming later this year most likely in the fall due to antibody dependent enhancement
[2:07:40.760 --> 2:07:48.440]  ADE so this is a death machine and we have to opt out of that machine in every way possible
[2:07:48.440 --> 2:07:51.840]  we got to learn to be more self-reliant we got to learn to say no to masks and no to
[2:07:51.840 --> 2:07:56.560]  vaccines and I know after the break here we're going to show the photos of what's in the
[2:07:56.560 --> 2:08:02.120]  masks I took these myself with my digital microscope it's mind-blowing Alex there are
[2:08:02.120 --> 2:08:09.520]  little hooks there are little gripper fibers red and blue fibers in in these masks and
[2:08:09.520 --> 2:08:14.520]  in the nasal swabs I did ultraviolet photography I did iodine staining on some of them to show
[2:08:14.520 --> 2:08:19.400]  the contrast it is mind-blowing what's in these masks and this is all getting inhaled
[2:08:19.400 --> 2:08:25.120]  into your lungs and the little hooks are grabbing on to your lung tissue these things are designed
[2:08:25.120 --> 2:08:30.720]  to cause harm not to help and they do not block the virus transmission so that's kind
[2:08:30.720 --> 2:08:36.200]  of the summary of where we are Alex right now we're tell more about what because Wolfgang
[2:08:36.200 --> 2:08:40.720]  Woodard back in December wrote a big paper with with the former chief scientist at Pfizer
[2:08:40.720 --> 2:08:47.040]  saying what you just said but explain what that ADD is for people that's important antibody
[2:08:47.040 --> 2:08:52.160]  dependent enhancement means that after you've been vaccinated your immune system is pathogenically
[2:08:52.160 --> 2:08:58.720]  primed to overreact to subsequent exposure to regular pathogens in the wild such as an
[2:08:58.720 --> 2:09:03.800]  influenza or a harmless coronavirus that you might get exposed to later on in the year
[2:09:03.800 --> 2:09:08.200]  your immune system will overreact you'll have a hyper inflammatory reaction that can lead
[2:09:08.200 --> 2:09:15.560]  to death and this by the way doesn't even cover the prion risk I mean they admit in
[2:09:15.560 --> 2:09:20.360]  mainline science that this can cause a massive autoimmune response like the Spanish flu to
[2:09:20.360 --> 2:09:26.480]  any other regular virus Alex you're going to see the hospitals in the fall or the winter
[2:09:26.480 --> 2:09:31.480]  probably filled with people who are dying from this antibody dependent enhancement
[2:09:31.480 --> 2:09:35.080]  side effect of the vaccine and they're going to make a new covid variant and not even point
[2:09:35.080 --> 2:09:39.600]  out that it's vaccinated you nailed it they're going to they're going to blame the unvaccinated
[2:09:39.600 --> 2:09:44.240]  for that wave but if you check it's only going to be people who have been vaccinated that
[2:09:44.240 --> 2:09:49.240]  are in the hospitals at that time and they're going to be dying in waves it's not a good
[2:09:49.240 --> 2:09:53.320]  situation this is part of the depopulation agenda this is going to play out over the
[2:09:53.320 --> 2:09:58.560]  next two to three years and people who have already been vaccinated there is no undo sadly
[2:09:58.560 --> 2:10:02.400]  there's no undo let's just let me just tell you this my spirit my instinct my intellect
[2:10:02.400 --> 2:10:06.400]  says get to the country get dug in now I've waited too long I'm so busy on there I haven't
[2:10:06.400 --> 2:10:10.240]  done it but I'm going to be away some in the next few months because I have to get ready
[2:10:10.240 --> 2:10:15.120]  I mean it's a miracle if it doesn't go to the next stage Bill Gates and the UN have
[2:10:15.120 --> 2:10:21.680]  set things in motion now that I don't think they can turn off Mike yeah you can't turn
[2:10:21.680 --> 2:10:26.280]  this back because once once your immune system has been compromised and quote pathogenically
[2:10:26.280 --> 2:10:30.840]  primed then everything else it just falls like dominoes upon your subsequent exposure
[2:10:30.840 --> 2:10:35.960]  so this was already set in stone there's nothing that we can do except pray for those who have
[2:10:35.960 --> 2:10:40.400]  taken the vaccine and avoid those vaccines ourselves if we want to live and avoid those
[2:10:40.400 --> 2:10:44.280]  that have had the vaccines we're seeing major literature on that now we'll talk about shedding
[2:10:44.280 --> 2:10:48.880]  too many others are exposing that we got Mike Adams is our guest naturalnews.com stay with
[2:10:48.880 --> 2:10:58.520]  us one of the most popular memes on the internet the last decade has been Alex Jones was right
[2:10:58.520 --> 2:11:04.840]  but it now routinely trends number one on platforms like Twitter and Facebook making
[2:11:04.840 --> 2:11:09.280]  the globalists pull their hair out in anger well let me tell you we are tomorrow's news
[2:11:09.280 --> 2:11:14.320]  today and thanks for your support we're still on air at infohorns.com and bandot video radio
[2:11:14.320 --> 2:11:18.040]  stations and TV stations across the country and our film in game censored and taken offline
[2:11:18.040 --> 2:11:22.880]  by Amazon when it hit number one a few years ago it's now available again we have reprinted
[2:11:22.880 --> 2:11:27.280]  it on high quality DVD in HD it has a zero country code meaning anyone in the world is
[2:11:27.280 --> 2:11:31.360]  authorized to make copies of it and I'm asking you to get the original make copies give it
[2:11:31.360 --> 2:11:35.280]  to everyone you know Arital Local Access TV give it to your pastors your police chiefs
[2:11:35.280 --> 2:11:39.000]  your state reps your prime ministers whatever you do warn the world this film uses their
[2:11:39.000 --> 2:11:44.080]  own documents and statements 14 years ago to expose them it's more important than ever
[2:11:44.080 --> 2:11:52.800]  available at infowarstore.com that's infowarstore.com in game blueprint for global enslavement
[2:11:52.800 --> 2:11:59.120]  the equation is very simple the mega banks control the media they control big pharma
[2:11:59.120 --> 2:12:06.480]  they control academia they control the military industrial complex they control big tech and
[2:12:06.480 --> 2:12:12.120]  everywhere that they have been in control in the third world the hipsters absolute total
[2:12:12.120 --> 2:12:18.760]  desperate system and dehumanization it is the western christian idea of human freedom
[2:12:18.760 --> 2:12:23.080]  that ended slavery and that promoted women's rights and so much more that actually threatens
[2:12:23.080 --> 2:12:29.480]  them so because they can't defeat that empowering ethic they instead co-opted turn it upside
[2:12:29.480 --> 2:12:36.920]  down and use the idea of equality to actually destroy human freedom and the free market
[2:12:36.920 --> 2:12:41.320]  that threatens their monopoly some control that's why they target info wars because
[2:12:41.320 --> 2:12:46.800]  we understand the keys to the feeding of the only way our transmission gets out is if you
[2:12:46.800 --> 2:12:54.880]  promote info wars and ban that video so we double your efforts we're all in this together
[2:12:54.880 --> 2:13:18.640]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:13:18.640 --> 2:13:21.960]  all right welcome back to the most censored most lied about most demonized broadcast
[2:13:21.960 --> 2:13:28.000]  world on alex jones my god is a health ranger incredible best get a journalist is with us
[2:13:28.000 --> 2:13:31.360]  and i want to get into what he found in the mask a lot of people are asking questions
[2:13:31.360 --> 2:13:35.960]  about these he went out and bought new ones so that was controlled he has a high highly
[2:13:35.960 --> 2:13:42.440]  certified lab he looked at them and it's just bizarre and again the whole thing's a fraud
[2:13:42.440 --> 2:13:47.480]  these things grow bacterial pneumonia they don't protect you that's in a lot of studies
[2:13:47.480 --> 2:13:53.160]  but they're the symbol of the ongoing slavery so the system pushes it so for tv viewers when
[2:13:53.160 --> 2:13:59.120]  we put the article on screen it's at naturalnews.com and info wars.com you share this with folks
[2:13:59.120 --> 2:14:02.880]  especially for children they understand a lot of people are collapsing they're passing
[2:14:02.880 --> 2:14:06.720]  out they're dying in car wrecks they have lungs that are collapsing when they make runners
[2:14:06.720 --> 2:14:14.120]  wear these this is all a giant miller experiment to see what we will put up with so covid swabs
[2:14:14.120 --> 2:14:20.840]  and masks appear to have hooks and strange fibers that can be inhaled directly into
[2:14:20.840 --> 2:14:27.240]  the lungs so let's go ahead and go back to mike adams what's going on here well first
[2:14:27.240 --> 2:14:32.960]  of all i took these photos myself on a digital microscope so it's clear this microscope is
[2:14:32.960 --> 2:14:37.280]  also capable of capturing video i know people have asked me the number one question is did
[2:14:37.280 --> 2:14:42.000]  you see anything moving because there there are other videos out there that appear to
[2:14:42.000 --> 2:14:47.320]  show little fibers and elements moving maybe in response to environmental changes of humidity
[2:14:47.320 --> 2:14:52.440]  and so on i did not see anything moving so i did not take any video on this these are
[2:14:52.440 --> 2:14:57.800]  all still shots but if i do i'm obviously i'm doing more research on this i have more
[2:14:57.800 --> 2:15:03.640]  samples coming in we're also going to be looking at the actual cells in the vaccines themselves
[2:15:03.640 --> 2:15:08.280]  so i'm using some staining techniques and some you know microbiology laboratory techniques
[2:15:08.280 --> 2:15:13.200]  to be able to visualize those with a better definition i'll be publishing those in the
[2:15:13.200 --> 2:15:18.960]  in the weeks ahead but so far no i have not seen anything moving which is which is good
[2:15:18.960 --> 2:15:24.120]  i wouldn't i would hope there's nothing you know alive in a in a mask or a swab but who
[2:15:24.120 --> 2:15:28.240]  knows so i'm always going to be on the lookout for that what i have seen as you're showing
[2:15:28.240 --> 2:15:33.920]  on your screen there and especially the purple images show the ultraviolet light imaging
[2:15:33.920 --> 2:15:40.800]  of these and it shows very bizarre structures the one you're showing right now is in a mask
[2:15:40.800 --> 2:15:46.880]  and that's a carbon fiber matrix surrounding objects that to me look like egg sacks i'm
[2:15:46.880 --> 2:15:51.440]  not saying that they're actually larvae or eggs or anything that's that's just the shape
[2:15:51.440 --> 2:15:55.920]  they look like little matrix cocoons i think that's very bizarre i don't know what that's
[2:15:55.920 --> 2:16:01.920]  doing in there other images show these blue and red fibers many people might associate
[2:16:01.920 --> 2:16:06.560]  that with more gallons i'm not claiming that that's more gallons i don't know what they
[2:16:06.560 --> 2:16:14.120]  are i'm just saying that these are all unedited no photoshop i just took the images i may have
[2:16:14.120 --> 2:16:20.000]  adjusted contrast and brightness a little bit but this is raw microscopy of what's in
[2:16:20.000 --> 2:16:25.440]  the masks and what's in the swabs there's i that's an iodine stained swab right there
[2:16:25.440 --> 2:16:31.720]  i use iodine as a stain in order to show more contrast and you can see then the synthetic
[2:16:31.720 --> 2:16:37.400]  fibers coming off the swab that appear to have something on the tips some kind of structure
[2:16:37.400 --> 2:16:40.480]  on the tips of these fibers i'm not sure what that is we're going to be able to zoom in
[2:16:40.480 --> 2:16:47.040]  more soon and get more definition though that's also on the swab right there using ultraviolet
[2:16:47.040 --> 2:16:53.480]  illumination and time lapse photography using some depth of field techniques and it shows
[2:16:53.480 --> 2:16:59.760]  weird kind of glowing sparkling reflecting of the ultraviolet light so these are all
[2:16:59.760 --> 2:17:06.040]  raw images i don't claim to know what all these things are but i do say they are real
[2:17:06.040 --> 2:17:09.760]  this is what's in your mask this is what's in your nasal swabs i know from all the studies
[2:17:09.760 --> 2:17:13.560]  that it's really bad for you it turns out falchi wrote one in 2008 saying most of the
[2:17:13.560 --> 2:17:19.240]  deaths in the spanish flu were from bacterial pneumonia because people were wearing the mask
[2:17:19.240 --> 2:17:23.280]  yeah it's very clear alex that these masks contain materials that will be inhaled into
[2:17:23.280 --> 2:17:28.800]  the lungs and some of these materials appear to have little gripper heads that may be able
[2:17:28.800 --> 2:17:33.880]  to hook onto the soft tissue let me ask you this i called you a few days ago and said
[2:17:33.880 --> 2:17:38.880]  what do you think of the footage from a microscope on screen out of germany where they looked
[2:17:38.880 --> 2:17:45.280]  at one of the vaccines it looked like little little cells with little membranes swimming
[2:17:45.280 --> 2:17:49.440]  around moving around you know that could be something else things vibrating inside we
[2:17:49.440 --> 2:17:53.360]  don't know but the point is this all needs to be investigated they're keeping all of
[2:17:53.360 --> 2:17:57.120]  this very very secret i have an article that just broke billionaire bill gates says no
[2:17:57.120 --> 2:18:02.240]  to sharing vaccine recipe with poor countries well that's because that's um because he doesn't
[2:18:02.240 --> 2:18:06.320]  want people to know what's in them these are experimental they're not even telling us they're
[2:18:06.320 --> 2:18:11.520]  saying it's proprietary this is a recipe for total disaster yeah that's exactly right and
[2:18:11.520 --> 2:18:16.080]  i do want to urge caution when we see things moving under the microscope uh the just the
[2:18:16.080 --> 2:18:23.320]  microscope light uh is a source of heat and sometimes heat can cause some uh convection
[2:18:23.320 --> 2:18:27.400]  in the the liquid exactly so sometimes things could appear to be moving that's why i'm being
[2:18:27.400 --> 2:18:31.800]  very cautious about this but i'm going to do more investigations and we do need to be on
[2:18:31.800 --> 2:18:35.640]  the lookout for what's in the vaccines the masks and the swabs well mike what you need
[2:18:35.640 --> 2:18:39.560]  to do techniques what you need is you got a certified lab we can do this too but you've
[2:18:39.560 --> 2:18:45.560]  got a lab why don't you wear a mask for a day show a clean mask under an electron microscope
[2:18:45.560 --> 2:18:50.440]  we're under a microscope and then show a dirty one now now that's a great idea to be growing
[2:18:50.440 --> 2:18:55.080]  in that sucker i don't know that i want to wear a mask but i'll i'll do it for science
[2:18:55.080 --> 2:18:59.800]  just for a day just to run the experiment why not that's a great idea well please come back
[2:18:59.800 --> 2:19:02.920]  on when that happens but we've got the rest of the hour with you i want to pick your brand
[2:19:02.920 --> 2:19:08.120]  on other subjects now what do you make of bill gates wanting to keep in all these vaccines
[2:19:08.120 --> 2:19:12.280]  that he's helped produce secret i mean a how does he have the power to do that it only shows
[2:19:12.280 --> 2:19:17.640]  he's in charge of everything and then b uh i mean that's just another illustration about
[2:19:17.640 --> 2:19:23.240]  secret of this is well it's very clear that they're putting things in these vaccines that if people
[2:19:23.240 --> 2:19:27.800]  knew what was in there they would not take them and and by the way part of the emergency
[2:19:27.800 --> 2:19:34.760]  authorization use that was granted by the fda allows vaccine manufacturers to not tell the public
[2:19:34.760 --> 2:19:39.560]  what ingredients they're using that's actually part of of that emergency authorization protocol
[2:19:39.560 --> 2:19:44.680]  so they can skip the the normal requirements for complete disclosure which means that we
[2:19:44.680 --> 2:19:49.400]  absolutely do not know what's in these vaccines they are withholding that information and we
[2:19:49.400 --> 2:19:53.400]  could assume though that it's there's a nefarious reason for this because they're probably putting
[2:19:53.400 --> 2:20:00.280]  things in there that are designed to accelerate vaccine reactions vaccine viral shedding as well
[2:20:00.280 --> 2:20:05.480]  as infertility effects which bill gates has been an advocate of for you know a decade or more
[2:20:06.040 --> 2:20:10.840]  and also possibly to cause all of these blood clots which end up causing heart attacks and
[2:20:10.840 --> 2:20:17.400]  strokes and lung problems you know blood clots which are caused by all the four vaccines approved
[2:20:17.400 --> 2:20:22.440]  in the united states right now blood clots they appear as different symptoms in different parts
[2:20:22.440 --> 2:20:28.280]  of the body so a blood clot in the brain might be diagnosed as a stroke a blood clot in the heart
[2:20:28.280 --> 2:20:33.080]  might cause a heart attack you know blood clots in the lungs would have a different diagnosis
[2:20:33.080 --> 2:20:39.480]  so blood clots are circulating in the body and and then that's the diagnosis that's given so that
[2:20:39.480 --> 2:20:44.120]  doctors say well it wasn't the vaccine no it was a heart attack well guess what the heart attack
[2:20:44.120 --> 2:20:49.800]  was caused by the blood clots from the vaccine from the antibodies which cause blood platelet
[2:20:49.800 --> 2:20:56.280]  aggregation in the body so even the antibodies themselves are biologically active uh mike
[2:20:56.280 --> 2:21:01.000]  eden from from formerly from Pfizer he talked about this they're biologically active so the
[2:21:01.000 --> 2:21:06.280]  antibodies themselves are causing coagulation of the blood that's leading to blood clots and deaths
[2:21:06.280 --> 2:21:11.560]  and let's let that sink in let's let that sink in when we come back all four of these vaccines are
[2:21:11.560 --> 2:21:16.200]  banned in dozens of countries of peace from the Pfizer to the AstraZeneca but then they act like
[2:21:16.200 --> 2:21:21.160]  we're cooks when we say look out when we said look out before so this is all a process just like
[2:21:21.160 --> 2:21:26.120]  with autism to see how bad they can hurt us and can they get away with it and to cover up the autism
[2:21:26.120 --> 2:21:31.800]  but even bigger crisis what will the next crisis be that they cover things up well that's uh that
[2:21:31.800 --> 2:21:36.600]  a d e that mike Adams is just talking about he knows what he's talking about there is a lot to
[2:21:36.600 --> 2:21:41.560]  go over a lot to break down please tell everyone you know on twitter facebook everywhere while you
[2:21:41.560 --> 2:21:46.840]  still can to tune in now the info wars dot com port slash show and bandot video and local stations
[2:21:46.840 --> 2:21:54.120]  this is live at desktop i'm not going to sit here and waste your time or my time and rattle off
[2:21:54.120 --> 2:22:01.320]  the successes info wars has had if you're paying attention you know we've done together but i'll
[2:22:01.320 --> 2:22:08.840]  tell you this the technocrats are really upping their game and they are trying to destroy all
[2:22:08.840 --> 2:22:14.600]  independent forms of media they're trying to shutter and silence human resistance so now is
[2:22:14.600 --> 2:22:19.480]  the time to understand that everything we've talked about has been proven accurate everything you
[2:22:19.480 --> 2:22:24.360]  everything you warned your friends and family about us around to be true so it's now that your
[2:22:24.360 --> 2:22:31.880]  credibility is way up the power structure to silence those of us that they can but it's up to all of us
[2:22:31.880 --> 2:22:38.600]  to not let them silence any of us we have the power but the sun is setting on humanity and
[2:22:38.600 --> 2:22:44.360]  setting on free speech we have to make sure that we fight hard right now to make sure that a long
[2:22:44.360 --> 2:22:49.960]  dark night doesn't come so be the polar bears you are
[2:22:51.800 --> 2:22:56.120]  Gerald in south Carolina go ahead you're on the air trying to move quicker hey alex welcome

[2:23:19.240 --> 2:23:26.200]  to just quote from the bible jesus is saying as to where we are right now this is matthew 24 verse

[2:26:07.640 --> 2:26:13.560]  us capital police department in order to foment a false narrative for the power hungry cowards of
[2:26:13.560 --> 2:26:21.160]  the u.s congress we will carry these heroes and their families with us for the rest of our careers
[2:26:21.800 --> 2:26:32.680]  their deaths will not be in vain capital officer um sick me who uh has died in the line of duty
[2:26:33.720 --> 2:26:40.680]  our sympathies and our concerns go out for his family and the people responsible should be held
[2:26:40.680 --> 2:26:51.000]  accountable he faced down terrorist attackers and sacrificed himself his own safety his own security
[2:26:51.000 --> 2:26:58.440]  and ultimately his life on january 6 2021 he joined his fellow police officers to defend the capital
[2:26:58.440 --> 2:27:05.880]  from invasion by violent mob he was attacked by the invaders pepper sprayed twice and reportedly
[2:27:05.880 --> 2:27:11.240]  hit in the head with a fire extinguisher he later collapsed in his office as a result of his
[2:27:11.240 --> 2:27:17.400]  injuries and was transported to the hospital where he died the next day on january 6 brian sicknick
[2:27:17.400 --> 2:27:23.720]  texted his brother twice after being hit with pepper spray telling him he was in good shape but
[2:27:23.720 --> 2:27:30.360]  sometime after 10 p.m sick nick collapsed and was taken to a dc hospital where he was put on a ventilator
[2:27:30.360 --> 2:27:37.160]  after suffering from two strokes and a blood clot around 9 30 p.m on january 7 sick nick died
[2:27:37.160 --> 2:27:43.240]  immediately the capital police released a statement claiming sick nick died due to injury sustained
[2:27:43.240 --> 2:27:49.400]  while on duty saying sick nick was injured while physically engaging with protesters and that he
[2:27:49.400 --> 2:27:55.240]  was taken to a local hospital where he succumbed to his injuries then the fourth estate got to work
[2:27:55.240 --> 2:28:01.080]  turning sick nick into a martyr for the democrat's big lie the new york times began the onslaught of
[2:28:01.080 --> 2:28:07.080]  lies falsely reporting that sick nick had died after being struck by a fire extinguisher the
[2:28:07.080 --> 2:28:29.880]  propaganda floodgates had been opened the new york times is reporting that the fbi has now
[2:28:29.880 --> 2:28:36.040]  zeroed in on an unnamed assailant in the death of capital police officer brian sicknick who died
[2:28:36.040 --> 2:28:41.800]  after he fought with protesters according to the times the fbi suspects sick nick may have died
[2:28:41.800 --> 2:28:48.680]  because of a bad reaction to being hit with bear spray or mace this new video showing one of the
[2:28:48.680 --> 2:28:55.400]  rioters heave a fire extinguisher at a line of police striking several in the head homicide
[2:28:55.400 --> 2:29:01.400]  investigators probing the death of capital police officer brian sick nick have been looking into
[2:29:01.400 --> 2:29:06.920]  reports that he may have been hit with a fire extinguisher capital hill cop ryan sick nick
[2:29:06.920 --> 2:29:13.240]  was killed by a blow to the head with a fire extinguisher on march 14 julian elie cater 32
[2:29:13.240 --> 2:29:19.560]  of pennsylvania and george pierre tanio's 39 of west virginia were charged with assaulting sick nick
[2:29:19.560 --> 2:29:25.720]  with a substance similar to bear spray but unlike the still unknown capital police officer who had
[2:29:25.720 --> 2:29:31.720]  all charges dropped after killing air force veteran ashley babbitt in cold blood without a vocal
[2:29:31.720 --> 2:29:37.320]  warning or even a warning shot cater and tanio's were awaiting the results of the medical examiner
[2:29:37.320 --> 2:29:44.120]  to see if they would be charged with sick nick's death on april 19th 2021 over three months after
[2:29:44.120 --> 2:29:49.720]  the autopsy the office of the chief medical examiner of the district of columbia francisco
[2:29:49.720 --> 2:29:55.640]  j diez released its report concluding that the manner of death was natural and that the manner
[2:29:55.640 --> 2:30:01.240]  of death was due to two strokes and a blood clot diez then told the washington post that
[2:30:01.240 --> 2:30:06.760]  there was no evidence that sick nick had an allergic reaction to chemicals or was otherwise
[2:30:06.760 --> 2:30:12.360]  injured and that all that transpired played a role in his condition and now as the washington
[2:30:12.360 --> 2:30:17.800]  examiner reports senator ron johnson a wisconsin republican on thursday sent a letter to acting
[2:30:17.800 --> 2:30:23.720]  capital police chief yogananda pitman contending the determination from chief medical officer
[2:30:23.720 --> 2:30:29.000]  francisco diez who told the washington examiner last week that sick nick's cause of death was a
[2:30:29.000 --> 2:30:35.560]  stroke raises more questions about what the capital police knew and what actions they took
[2:30:35.560 --> 2:30:42.520]  to confirm certain facts regarding officer sick nick's death before it released its january 7th
[2:30:42.520 --> 2:30:48.600]  statement the massive cover-up by those that coward and hid behind their lies rather than face
[2:30:48.600 --> 2:30:55.720]  their concerned constituents is a prime example of the rot at the core of our republic i knew
[2:30:55.720 --> 2:31:01.080]  those are people that love this country that uh truly respect law enforcement would never do
[2:31:01.080 --> 2:31:05.320]  anything to to break a law that's why i wasn't concerned now had the tables been turned and
[2:31:05.320 --> 2:31:10.760]  joe this could be in trouble had the tables been turned and president trump won the election and
[2:31:10.760 --> 2:31:16.440]  those were tens of thousands of black lives matter and tifa protesters i might have been a
[2:31:16.440 --> 2:31:23.960]  little concerned john bound reporting all right we had a little technical difficulty
[2:31:23.960 --> 2:31:28.600]  doesn't seem to happen but a couple times a year it's happened twice today our relaying computer
[2:31:28.600 --> 2:31:33.560]  system for the radio network conked out for about 10 seconds but we are back and i appreciate uh
[2:31:33.560 --> 2:31:37.640]  mike adams holding through that longer break that was a very important report that's a whole
[2:31:37.640 --> 2:31:42.760]  other separate issue i was actually gonna raise to mike adams in our final segment coming up about
[2:31:42.760 --> 2:31:47.720]  the destabilization campaigns the collapsing border how we can counter this strategies to
[2:31:47.720 --> 2:31:52.760]  get on the offense or do we just have to dig in now to the long horrible collapse of the us into
[2:31:52.760 --> 2:31:57.800]  the mark of the beast world government system you know we fought so long we're so vindicated
[2:31:57.800 --> 2:32:02.280]  at this point we're so thankful for all of our radio and tv stations out there and all the great
[2:32:02.280 --> 2:32:07.720]  folks that know what's happening uh mike let's talk about that let's talk about big picture uh
[2:32:07.720 --> 2:32:13.640]  because i mean it's all out in the open animal human cloning government run pedophilia uh just
[2:32:13.640 --> 2:32:19.720]  pure evil is upon us studying history studying these the cycles of of of decadence that we've
[2:32:19.720 --> 2:32:26.360]  gone into how do we combat this well it's very clear that the media the mainstream media is a
[2:32:26.360 --> 2:32:31.800]  psychological terrorism operation that's their job is to terrorize america this was even admitted
[2:32:31.800 --> 2:32:39.400]  by a cnn executive with the project veritas expose so and james o'keith is an american hero of course
[2:32:39.400 --> 2:32:48.200]  for his work so what we need to do is understand that anytime that we feel uh rising hatred or fear
[2:32:48.200 --> 2:32:53.880]  we need to recognize that is a manipulated reaction an emotion so the media is trying to make you
[2:32:53.880 --> 2:33:00.600]  afraid of covet make you afraid of other races they're trying to push a racial you know they
[2:33:00.600 --> 2:33:05.880]  want to race wars really what they want they want to riot they want to they want shootings in the
[2:33:05.880 --> 2:33:11.720]  streets of of blacks and whites shooting and killing each other so the answer to this is to reject
[2:33:11.720 --> 2:33:20.360]  the racial hatred and to embrace those who who have earned it with with merit to embrace those of
[2:33:20.360 --> 2:33:26.040]  other colors and other religions and other genders male and female there are only two genders but
[2:33:26.040 --> 2:33:31.240]  let's welcome uh women into groups that are traditionally men and the other way around um
[2:33:31.240 --> 2:33:35.080]  i'm not saying bathrooms you know keep the men out of women's bathrooms obviously
[2:33:35.080 --> 2:33:42.200]  but let's men and women work together to restore freedom and liberty and we have to learn to
[2:33:42.200 --> 2:33:48.840]  believe it or not you know express love to people rather than a hatred that is invoked from the media
[2:33:48.840 --> 2:33:54.040]  and and to not play a part in their massive nationwide false flag effort that they're trying
[2:33:54.040 --> 2:33:57.800]  to push because that's what they want they want to race war and then they want to be able to invoke
[2:33:57.800 --> 2:34:03.480]  the military to be deployed domestically to confiscate the guns throw everybody into female
[2:34:03.480 --> 2:34:09.000]  camps and then basically from that point forward it's a totalitarian military dictatorship and
[2:34:09.000 --> 2:34:15.400]  that's that's communism that's their plan so um now of course we we must also practice self-defense
[2:34:16.200 --> 2:34:20.680]  you know in our homes and with our families and on our property and so on i'm not saying to
[2:34:20.680 --> 2:34:26.520]  express love to an attacker who's trying to kill you sometimes you have to shoot in self-defense
[2:34:26.520 --> 2:34:32.440]  but do not allow the media to control your emotions to go out and invoke violence or to
[2:34:32.440 --> 2:34:38.680]  provoke hatred toward anyone else because the media has made you mad monitor your emotions control
[2:34:38.680 --> 2:34:44.520]  what you're thinking what you're feeling in your heart be stoic i mean defend the country have
[2:34:44.520 --> 2:34:48.920]  courage but do not allow yourself to be a puppet of the media that's that's my message

[2:40:06.440 --> 2:40:11.720]  first and it's some big republican news you know they just had a big event announced in florida the
[2:40:11.720 --> 2:40:17.400]  big republican leadership summit and president trump's not invited the lead speaker is list chaining
[2:40:18.600 --> 2:40:21.960]  super unpopular with the republicans super unpopular with the american people
[2:40:21.960 --> 2:40:27.160]  but that's who they're gonna force feed us with and cnn's created a new special board of neocons
[2:40:27.160 --> 2:40:32.760]  who will judge whether the republican party is moral or not i mean this is all just sick
[2:40:32.760 --> 2:40:38.600]  disgusting gaslighting but we showed this article over the weekend it's totally freaking india out
[2:40:38.600 --> 2:40:44.920]  my gathams the health ranger here with us india's public health ambassador dies a day after taking
[2:40:44.920 --> 2:40:52.440]  cover vaccine one of the top stars in bollywood the top comedian in the country he took it and
[2:40:52.440 --> 2:40:57.000]  died of a heart attack a day later well it's right here in the literature what is
[2:40:57.000 --> 2:41:06.040]  this myco cardius heart inflammation in some phizer vaccine patients probed in israel news week
[2:41:06.040 --> 2:41:10.440]  well that's what's happening to a lot of people they're dying of heart attacks reportedly mdx is
[2:41:10.440 --> 2:41:16.360]  what his family said died of a heart attack a day after he took the shot that's on the inserts
[2:41:16.360 --> 2:41:21.640]  it can cause your heart to swell up what's really happening here my gathams well right i i believe
[2:41:21.640 --> 2:41:27.560]  the rapper dmx did die from from the covet vaccine that that was then diagnosed as a heart attack
[2:41:27.560 --> 2:41:32.520]  right so this is what i talked about a couple of segments ago once you have blood clots those
[2:41:32.520 --> 2:41:37.080]  blood clots get circulated through your body and they can end up in your brain your lungs your heart
[2:41:37.080 --> 2:41:44.040]  or other organs or tissues and there they can be fatal and this is caused by these vaccines so a lot
[2:41:44.040 --> 2:41:48.520]  of people who thought they were going to be vaccine advocates or even celebrities who have
[2:41:48.520 --> 2:41:55.560]  been paid by the vaccine industry to take a vaccine shot on camera sometimes days or weeks later
[2:41:55.560 --> 2:42:01.240]  those people are dead and then you know you're supposed to forget that they came out and touted
[2:42:01.240 --> 2:42:06.600]  the vaccine and took a shot on camera but the vaccine industry has killed just this year you
[2:42:06.600 --> 2:42:12.840]  know baseball legend hank erin and and famous boxers and celebrities and even a financial i think
[2:42:12.840 --> 2:42:20.040]  or a legal analyst on cnn a black woman in her 40s was killed by the vaccine i believe so this is
[2:42:20.040 --> 2:42:25.480]  happening the deaths are being covered up so remember last year before the vaccine if you died
[2:42:25.480 --> 2:42:31.400]  of anything it was called called a covet death but this year if you die from the vaccine it's
[2:42:31.400 --> 2:42:36.840]  called the coincidence so coincidence is the number one leading cause of death now in 2021 because
[2:42:36.840 --> 2:42:41.560]  it's really vaccines killing people the cover-up is here they're going to blame the unvaccinated
[2:42:41.560 --> 2:42:47.480]  for the variant strains and they're going to keep pushing vaccines until they exterminate as many
[2:42:47.480 --> 2:42:52.440]  people as possible their goal is billions this is going to continue until people rise up peacefully
[2:42:52.440 --> 2:42:58.760]  and stop this this is medical tyranny this is an extermination agenda just to kind of wrap up my
[2:42:58.760 --> 2:43:05.240]  appearance on your show today this is an extermination agenda they will come for you sooner or later if
[2:43:05.240 --> 2:43:10.280]  they haven't already you need to get out of the blue cities get out of the blue states get to some
[2:43:10.280 --> 2:43:15.400]  place where you can have some self-reliance you need to get real assets because an economic
[2:43:15.400 --> 2:43:20.360]  collapse is coming they're going to confiscate all the dollars in bank account that was my next
[2:43:20.360 --> 2:43:25.080]  point john hopkins seems to be the head group that comes up with the talking points and their
[2:43:25.080 --> 2:43:29.720]  different spars events and their other different events but another big one that they're now fore
[2:43:29.720 --> 2:43:34.360]  shadowing came out two years ago and that is a quote cyber attack that brings down the world
[2:43:34.360 --> 2:43:38.600]  currency the globalists have created trillions of fake derivatives they need a way to convince us
[2:43:38.600 --> 2:43:43.400]  it's our fault they're using the great reset as the cover they now admit they're actually
[2:43:43.400 --> 2:43:50.840]  doing that i mean why are they being so obvious about this well they realize that they've lobotomized
[2:43:50.840 --> 2:43:55.960]  so many people with the vaccines because many strokes are caused in people's brains who take
[2:43:55.960 --> 2:44:01.480]  these vaccines the many strokes are like little mini lobotomies and i really ask your audience to
[2:44:01.480 --> 2:44:06.200]  hear me on this point people who are taking these vaccines are losing cognitive function
[2:44:06.200 --> 2:44:11.160]  i've heard reports of people who cannot do their jobs anymore they come back to work after taking
[2:44:11.160 --> 2:44:16.760]  a vaccine the brains don't work in anymore they can't do their job functions so there are many
[2:44:16.760 --> 2:44:21.480]  strokes happening which is taking away cognition so one of the main goals of the vaccine is to
[2:44:21.480 --> 2:44:27.480]  brain damage people enough to accept the global reset agenda you see or to accept other vaccines
[2:44:27.480 --> 2:44:33.800]  or to accept biden as the fake president or to you know to watch a biden green screen glitch
[2:44:33.800 --> 2:44:39.960]  where the cdc exactly and then the cdc that's actually running at all then is the group investigating
[2:44:39.960 --> 2:44:44.760]  it i mean it's incredible but do you agree with me that that it's it's not going well for them
[2:44:44.760 --> 2:44:49.480]  overall the globalists are still moving forward they've initiated something you know like rolling
[2:44:49.480 --> 2:44:54.200]  a snowball downhill that can't be reversed at this point but i'm seeing a giant awakening people
[2:44:54.200 --> 2:44:58.680]  are talking about the deaths in fact here's an example of seeing an deception headline this weekend
[2:44:58.680 --> 2:45:03.720]  60 percent have taken the vaccine or planned to they don't want to see these these own numbers
[2:45:04.600 --> 2:45:09.160]  us today had the real numbers 15 percent of americans have been vaccinated now they say
[2:45:09.160 --> 2:45:13.880]  almost everyone else is refusing they're going to try to force it so they're lying by saying 60
[2:45:13.880 --> 2:45:19.960]  percent are thinking about it or have had it that's an exception so all over the world people are
[2:45:19.960 --> 2:45:26.840]  refusing it they may be able to vaccinate you know something between 40 and 50 percent of people
[2:45:26.840 --> 2:45:34.440]  who are misinformed so much that they're willing to commit vaccine suicide but beyond that 50 percent
[2:45:34.440 --> 2:45:39.320]  or so or whatever it is they're not going to be able to convince those people to take vaccines
[2:45:39.320 --> 2:45:44.280]  because people are informed and aware and they don't want to die from vaccine side effects so
[2:45:44.280 --> 2:45:49.720]  right now they're closing down vaccination sites in certain states across america some states are
[2:45:49.720 --> 2:45:54.040]  saying they no longer need the full allotment of vaccines from the federal government and now
[2:45:54.040 --> 2:45:59.080]  by the way alex that the big thing here is the government's going to shift into coercion mode
[2:45:59.080 --> 2:46:03.720]  because now that's what's being said they said now the hard part you can't go to what would you lie
[2:46:03.720 --> 2:46:09.640]  unless you've had a shot you know you can't leave your cage unless we say so that's right that's right
[2:46:09.640 --> 2:46:14.200]  so they're going to have to go into arm twisting or what one person called hand-to-hand combat mode
[2:46:14.200 --> 2:46:19.400]  going door-to-door trying to coerce you into getting a vaccine that's what's coming now in fact that
[2:46:19.400 --> 2:46:25.480]  is already beginning of the clinton foundation run contact tracers to get the giant giant contracts
[2:46:25.480 --> 2:46:29.080]  next they're going to demand to come on your land and test you that the un has said that
[2:46:30.360 --> 2:46:35.240]  yep well i i wonder if someday the supreme court might hear a self-defense case of somebody
[2:46:35.240 --> 2:46:40.840]  who defends their body against a vaccine attack using the second amendment that could be a future
[2:46:40.840 --> 2:46:45.800]  legal case because i got to tell you an attack with a vaccine that kills people is an attack with
[2:46:45.800 --> 2:46:51.880]  a deadly weapon and that that's with intent to cause harm so yes you do have the right you own
[2:46:51.880 --> 2:46:56.600]  your body and you have the right to defend your body and to defend your home against those who are
[2:46:56.600 --> 2:47:01.640]  trying to cause you bodily harm so that's going to be an interesting thing to see what happens but
[2:47:01.640 --> 2:47:05.800]  i suspect most of the coercion will come in the form of trying to starve you to death
[2:47:05.800 --> 2:47:10.680]  unless you agree to take the vaccine weaponizing that's the plan is the economic collapse weaponize
[2:47:10.680 --> 2:47:15.320]  the food absolutely well you certainly saw this a long time ago you know you're you're dug in in
[2:47:15.320 --> 2:47:19.240]  central texas i'm way behind the curve on that i mean i knew it was needed i've given that advice
[2:47:19.240 --> 2:47:24.760]  out but uh it's just i i feel really sorry for just the average hardworking person that doesn't
[2:47:24.760 --> 2:47:29.320]  have any means to try to get outside the city but if you've got family in real areas folks it's better
[2:47:29.320 --> 2:47:34.040]  to be poor than dead because i'm telling you the globalists are making their move on this country
[2:47:34.760 --> 2:47:39.800]  and remember folks uh assets are things that you can see and touch things that are under your control
[2:47:39.800 --> 2:47:43.240]  if you think you have assets because you're looking at a computer screen and there are numbers on
[2:47:43.240 --> 2:47:47.960]  that screen whether those numbers are bank account numbers or stock numbers those don't count because
[2:47:47.960 --> 2:47:53.400]  those can all be confiscated real assets are things that you can touch gold and silver land
[2:47:53.400 --> 2:47:57.480]  firearms and ammunition things that are real that are under your control that's what's going
[2:47:57.480 --> 2:48:02.440]  to survive this global reset so mark my words that day is coming i'm telling my friends i'm
[2:48:02.440 --> 2:48:07.640]  telling my family everybody needs to get ready now mike you are really doing a great job natural
[2:48:07.640 --> 2:48:12.280]  news dot com that that site's been banned by a lot of big tech media but you've got a lot of
[2:48:12.280 --> 2:48:17.400]  backup sites that are excellent as well give us some of the other wonderful urls you've got well

[2:48:47.080 --> 2:48:50.920]  i mean the global listening now the dial is over it's worse than i thought it would be
[2:48:50.920 --> 2:48:55.240]  and wow we can pat ourselves in the back but that's not the issue that you is

[2:49:03.800 --> 2:49:07.960]  that doesn't mean you don't call out races out of control black people or races out of control
[2:49:07.960 --> 2:49:11.720]  white people or whatever group it is doesn't mean you don't call them fools lebron james
[2:49:11.720 --> 2:49:16.360]  to nothing but like a black david duke on steroids but you don't hate other black people is because

[3:05:36.600 --> 3:05:44.760]  often it's all for show it doesn't do anything the chances of picking it up from a from a hard
[3:05:44.760 --> 3:05:52.200]  surface like one in 10,000 I'm not making that number up yet the freaks keep doing it everywhere

[3:06:05.800 --> 3:06:14.680]  masked up they're afraid but again forget the MIT study that came out last week that said your
[3:06:14.680 --> 3:06:21.880]  chances of picking up the virus outside are basically slimming none and now CNN says sir
[3:06:21.880 --> 3:06:27.400]  that that we should wear them forever we knew that was coming well the cartoon news network here

[3:06:44.760 --> 3:06:55.000]  of CMBC and then the guy goes on to write on and on you know that there are very few recorded
[3:06:55.000 --> 3:07:02.840]  instances of outdoor transmission because I killed it because sunlight kills it but they
[3:07:02.840 --> 3:07:07.560]  tell us don't go to the beach it's the worst place isn't it even though studies show it's the safest

[3:08:49.320 --> 3:08:55.960]  levels ranging from non-therapeutic to lethal killing many of the test subjects in game blueprint
[3:08:55.960 --> 3:09:00.680]  for global enslavement is one of the most important films ever made 14 years ago we tracked and
[3:09:00.680 --> 3:09:05.320]  documented the boulderberg groups activities and their plan for a great reset using the threat of
[3:09:05.320 --> 3:09:09.960]  a fake virus the film now is more important than ever when it's shot to number one on amazon last year
[3:09:09.960 --> 3:09:15.560]  they banned it we have it back in print available now at infowarstore.com selling them as low as

[3:09:27.400 --> 3:09:31.240]  in game blueprint for global enslavement available now at infowarstore.com
[3:09:31.240 --> 3:09:40.920]  the equation is very simple the mega banks control the media they control big pharma
[3:09:41.560 --> 3:09:47.640]  they control academia they control the military industrial complex they control big tech
[3:09:48.680 --> 3:09:54.280]  and everywhere that they have been in control in the third world they have established absolute
[3:09:54.280 --> 3:10:01.480]  total despotism and dehumanization it is the western christian idea of human freedom that
[3:10:01.480 --> 3:10:06.200]  ended slavery and that promoted women's rights and so much more that actually threatens them
[3:10:06.200 --> 3:10:12.440]  so because they can't defeat that empowering ethic they instead co-opted turn it upside down
[3:10:12.440 --> 3:10:19.960]  and use the idea of equality to actually destroy human freedom and the free market that threatens
[3:10:19.960 --> 3:10:25.720]  their monopoly so control that's why they target info wars because we understand the keys to the
[3:10:25.720 --> 3:10:30.920]  feeding them but the only way our transmission gets out is if you promote info wars and ban that
[3:10:30.920 --> 3:10:54.760]  video so we double your efforts we're all in this together you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:10:54.760 --> 3:11:10.360]  the answer to 1984 is 1776 you're listening to the alex jones show with gerald solente
[3:11:12.520 --> 3:11:18.840]  today's great being on the alex jones show i want to thank alex jones staff all that they do to
[3:11:18.840 --> 3:11:25.640]  keep the truth alive and it's so important to support them and all of us that are fighting
[3:11:25.640 --> 3:11:32.360]  for freedom because the facts are showing that they're stealing it from us and they're making
[3:11:32.360 --> 3:11:39.400]  stuff up just to gain more power i was talking about the study that came out the mit researchers
[3:11:39.400 --> 3:11:46.520]  say you're no safer from covet indoors at six feet or 60 feet a new study challenging social
[3:11:46.520 --> 3:11:57.240]  distancing policies and um they go on to say what our analysis can what our analysis continues
[3:11:57.240 --> 3:12:05.560]  to show is that many spaces that have been shut down in fact don't need to be i think if you run
[3:12:05.560 --> 3:12:11.720]  those numbers even right now for many types of spaces you'll find there is no need for occupancy
[3:12:11.720 --> 3:12:21.320]  restrictions 60 distancing rules that inadvertently result in closed businesses in schools are just
[3:12:21.320 --> 3:12:30.760]  not reasonable now remember this is coming from mit it's barely reported this was in cnbc last week
[3:12:31.720 --> 3:12:39.560]  the emphasis on distancing has been really misplaced from the very beginning the cdc or
[3:12:39.560 --> 3:12:48.920]  or world health organization have never really provided justification for it you got it it's
[3:12:48.920 --> 3:13:02.520]  right here now i want you to listen to this video of an arrogant little daddy's boy an arrogant
[3:13:02.520 --> 3:13:13.080]  little daddy's boy a nothing nothing of an arrogant governor who would be shoveling crap
[3:13:13.080 --> 3:13:20.200]  if daddy was in mario quomo and i'm gonna rename the tappancy bridge after my daddy
[3:13:20.200 --> 3:13:27.640]  and all you little pieces of scrap new yorkers have to pay for the change of the name on the bridge
[3:13:27.640 --> 3:13:36.760]  that only cost about 20 million dollars listen to this crap spewing out of this arrogant boy's mouth
[3:13:37.480 --> 3:13:44.680]  last april when he the governor decided we have to wear masks outside listen
[3:13:49.880 --> 3:13:52.920]  i'm going to issue an executive order that says all people in public
[3:13:52.920 --> 3:14:02.360]  must have a mask or nose covering mouth and nose covering and they must wear it in a situation
[3:14:02.360 --> 3:14:09.640]  where you cannot or are not maintaining social distancing meaning what meaning the same thing
[3:14:09.640 --> 3:14:17.400]  we've been saying from day one if you're going to be in public and you cannot maintain social
[3:14:17.400 --> 3:14:28.920]  distancing then have a mask and put the mask on when you are not in socially distant places
[3:14:30.200 --> 3:14:36.040]  you're walking down the street you're walking down the street alone great you're now at an
[3:14:36.040 --> 3:14:41.640]  intersection and there are people in the intersection and you're going to be in proximity
[3:14:41.640 --> 3:14:49.800]  to other people put the mask on you're right to go out for a walk in the park
[3:14:51.640 --> 3:14:56.280]  go out for a walk because you need to get out of the house the dog is getting on your nerves
[3:14:57.400 --> 3:15:06.200]  fine don't infect me you don't have a right to infect me if you are going to be in a situation
[3:15:06.200 --> 3:15:15.000]  in public where you may come into contact with other people in a situation that is not socially
[3:15:15.000 --> 3:15:28.600]  distanced you must have a mask or a cloth covering nose and mouth that is by executive order
[3:15:28.600 --> 3:15:37.560]  listen to that little piece of garbage talk to us like with third graders
[3:15:40.040 --> 3:15:41.640]  an arrogant nobody
[3:15:45.960 --> 3:15:52.600]  he goes on to say if you're going to be in close proximity to somebody outside you have to put
[3:15:52.600 --> 3:16:02.280]  a mask a piece of garbage boy MIT studies says you're full of crap because that's all that comes
[3:16:02.280 --> 3:16:06.440]  out of your mouth actually it's not coming out of your mouth it's coming out of your
[3:16:07.320 --> 3:16:16.200]  butt that's all you're doing is spewing crap right here there are very few recorded instances
[3:16:16.200 --> 3:16:23.080]  of outdoor transmission yet this little slime ball is telling executive I'm giving you an
[3:16:23.080 --> 3:16:31.480]  executive order take that executive order and shove it up your ass you are not my leader

[3:17:15.560 --> 3:17:23.000]  hey little fat mouth you're in a restaurant in New York right and a lot of stupid other places

[3:34:57.480 --> 3:35:03.080]  that almost killed me living defense brought me back i wanted to just quote from the bible
[3:35:03.080 --> 3:35:10.200]  jesus is saying as to where we are right now this is matthew 24 verse 9 then they shall deliver you
[3:35:10.200 --> 3:35:17.720]  up to be afflicted and shall kill you and you shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake
[3:35:17.720 --> 3:35:23.480]  and then shall many be offended and shall betray one another and shall hate one another that's
[3:35:23.480 --> 3:35:28.120]  right where we're at brother and that's because god's name is on the founding of this country no
[3:35:28.120 --> 3:35:35.320]  matter what they say and that's why the enemy hates it because god created this country this

[3:40:36.200 --> 3:40:42.120]  alive and it's not only in the united states so get off the trip that is just screwed up here
[3:40:42.680 --> 3:40:46.760]  in new trends journals going out tomorrow i'm working on this story just before i got on the air
[3:40:46.760 --> 3:40:52.840]  yeah japan covid state of emergency they just called it right so i look up the numbers
[3:40:54.520 --> 3:41:02.920]  to country of 126.3 million people over the course of 14 months 14 months
[3:41:02.920 --> 3:41:15.000]  9800 deaths what the hell you're telling me and have 126 million people
[3:41:18.200 --> 3:41:20.360]  9800 died of the virus
[3:41:20.360 --> 3:41:34.200]  for the grand total of 0.00775 percent and when you break it down monthly over the course of 14
[3:41:34.200 --> 3:41:45.000]  months that equates to 0.00554 percent and then we went on to write in a trends journal
[3:41:45.000 --> 3:41:50.360]  in november that last october
[3:41:53.400 --> 3:42:02.600]  more people died of suicide in japan in just one month than from the covid of all of that year
[3:42:02.600 --> 3:42:16.280]  up until november and suicide rates among women is a 15 spike yet they're closing it down germany
[3:42:16.280 --> 3:42:23.240]  locked down again oh and the average age of the germans that died of the virus
[3:42:25.320 --> 3:42:29.320]  it's over the highest number is over 79 years old
[3:42:29.320 --> 3:42:32.280]  it's over half
[3:42:38.440 --> 3:42:44.760]  moving on markets real quick the dow's down a little bit today the only thing that's keeping
[3:42:44.760 --> 3:42:49.240]  the markets up are low interest rates you see the cryptocurrencies are bouncing up again
[3:42:49.240 --> 3:42:54.600]  even though they keep trying to talk them down cryptos to us are going to stay high until central
[3:42:54.600 --> 3:43:01.240]  banks along with the governments and they wanted the same outlaw them and will they outlaw them
[3:43:01.240 --> 3:43:07.800]  that yes they will just like they did when fdr took the gold from the people back in 1933 you
[3:43:07.800 --> 3:43:13.560]  can't own this stuff they'll do it again they did it before they don't want competition because the
[3:43:13.560 --> 3:43:18.440]  whole world is going digital this way they know every penny is spent how you spent it where you
[3:43:18.440 --> 3:43:22.760]  spent it and they're going to make up a new currency so that they could say we're getting rid
[3:43:22.760 --> 3:43:30.280]  of that debt we had we have something new now because they're only making it up anyway 28 trillion
[3:43:30.280 --> 3:43:35.800]  dollar debt debt to GDP ratios the highest has been since world war two at the end of world war
[3:43:35.800 --> 3:43:41.080]  two so they're going to come up with something new i'm still bullish on gold and silver gold and
[3:43:41.080 --> 3:43:46.120]  silver both up a bit today particularly silver because silver is the greatest electricity conductor
[3:43:46.120 --> 3:43:53.640]  far better than copper and you use it in high tech to the heavy industry so we see the prices
[3:43:53.640 --> 3:43:58.520]  there keep going up they're artificially pushing them down i'm not making it up the goldman sacks
[3:43:58.520 --> 3:44:03.720]  gang was quote last year reading the fact that the precious metals markets i'm not making that up
[3:44:03.720 --> 3:44:10.920]  they could look it up they got a measly fine of 900 million dollars after screwing people out of
[3:44:10.920 --> 3:44:21.720]  them hundreds of billions of dollars by rigging the market on another note art is dead finished
[3:44:25.480 --> 3:44:31.480]  i surround myself with art all the plants you see some of them i got over a hundred plants in my
[3:44:31.480 --> 3:44:37.480]  office i take care of all of them i have art everywhere art is the way of finding the true
[3:44:37.480 --> 3:44:44.440]  meaning of the human spirit it's gone you saw the oscars last night right here's the headline
[3:44:45.400 --> 3:44:49.480]  of course you didn't see it oscar ratings crashed to an all-time low
[3:44:51.800 --> 3:44:57.800]  then you go back to the grammy's 2021 tv broadcast rating hit record lows according to nielson
[3:44:57.800 --> 3:45:09.640]  all right then you had nick jagger come out making fun of people that don't believe in the
[3:45:09.640 --> 3:45:19.480]  coveted war and telling people to get vaccinated when the artists were anti-established and by
[3:45:19.480 --> 3:45:23.960]  the way you know why the oscars are going down you got to change the name oscars that's that's
[3:45:23.960 --> 3:45:32.200]  too male we've got to change it to uh you know the transgender name and maybe they'll come they'll
[3:45:32.200 --> 3:45:37.880]  like it if it's not oscal we can't call it oscar anymore i mean let's be stupid can't say black
[3:45:37.880 --> 3:45:43.240]  bald anymore either it was black bald i say he was white bald while you were being dirty there so
[3:45:43.240 --> 3:45:51.880]  i think white bald black bald oscar greenberg iceberg what's the difference art is dead and
[3:45:51.880 --> 3:45:57.720]  art is the way to me of finding the true meaning of the human spirit people have set up with the
[3:45:57.720 --> 3:46:02.440]  crap they're pushing out there shows it and they're listening and watching to what's out there
[3:46:02.440 --> 3:46:09.560]  because that's all it's out there as trend forecasters and people subscribe to our magazine
[3:46:09.560 --> 3:46:15.880]  the trends journal we give them suggestions on what to do there's never been a better time right now
[3:46:15.880 --> 3:46:24.040]  now than a renaissance in art you know renaissance followed the black plague the people got it in
[3:46:24.040 --> 3:46:28.680]  their head that they were really stupid and that's why they were killing themselves ali romana
[3:46:28.680 --> 3:46:33.880]  a la antica a la antica in the manner of the romans and the ancients to describe the quality
[3:46:33.880 --> 3:46:42.120]  of their work and that's what we need to bring back a renaissance in art from mick jagger to
[3:46:42.120 --> 3:46:50.520]  willy nelson to lady gaga and all the rest they all sold out for the coven war
[3:46:53.240 --> 3:47:00.280]  it's not art anymore the art with artists were anti-establishment they knew what a fraud the
[3:47:00.280 --> 3:47:07.640]  establishment it's not an establishment it's a corrupt gang of people that are running the show
[3:47:07.640 --> 3:47:13.800]  daddy's boys and daddy's girls it's one big club daddy's girls look at nancy pelosi she'd be nobody
[3:47:13.800 --> 3:47:19.720]  if a daddy wasn't the mayor of baltimore at the height of when baltimore was booming one after another
[3:47:21.560 --> 3:47:30.360]  name the place name the state you're a member of the club so art the they're not artists there's
[3:47:30.360 --> 3:47:40.200]  sellouts true or i tells you to create what you want to be and be what you want and to bring it to
[3:47:40.200 --> 3:47:47.400]  the highest level again the numbers are showing in the oscars and the grammys and the others
[3:47:48.520 --> 3:47:55.480]  people have fed up with it there's never been a better entrepreneur opportunity now for new styles

[3:49:33.880 --> 3:49:38.200]  that i care about beating the new world order and it's because we have so much credibility they
[3:49:38.200 --> 3:49:42.520]  can't allow us to stay on air much longer and i don't have time to tell you all the stuff they're
[3:49:42.520 --> 3:49:47.080]  doing to us for a lot of reasons i can't tell you what's going on but let's just say this we're
[3:49:47.080 --> 3:49:52.440]  going to see this through the end we're going to stay on air as long as we can so please pray for us
[3:49:52.440 --> 3:49:56.680]  and please buy the products and then forwardstore.com they're great products plus they fund the
[3:49:56.680 --> 3:50:01.160]  operation so you know unlike other products you can buy they're still great do they fund

[3:50:06.360 --> 3:50:10.840]  when the whole world's waking up and looking for truth that's why the globalists are censoring
[3:50:10.840 --> 3:50:15.080]  they can't bring in all this tyranny and leave people like us on the air so while you're at it
