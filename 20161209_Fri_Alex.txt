[00:00.000 --> 00:14.960]  The answer to 1984 is 1776 you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[00:14.960 --> 00:26.720]  It is Friday December 9th 2016 we're going to be here live for the next four hours I'm
[00:26.720 --> 00:33.680]  your host Alex Jones coming to you from deep in the heart of Texas Austin broadcasting world one
[00:35.120 --> 00:42.400]  wow there is so much to go over today there is a story that's now come out that I was actually
[00:42.400 --> 00:47.360]  told about years ago and other similar stories and I asked why Trump wouldn't use it in the
[00:47.360 --> 00:52.400]  campaign they just said that's not how he operates but now after the campaign we learn
[00:52.400 --> 00:58.960]  black homeless woman says Trump allowed her to live in Trump Tower rent-free for the last eight
[00:58.960 --> 01:07.200]  years and even has room service deliver her food three times a day this is when Trump caught the
[01:07.200 --> 01:15.680]  police throwing her out she'd been squatting now why is that so interesting because I remember years
[01:15.680 --> 01:20.400]  ago hearing these stories about Trump but never in the news from individuals there's a bunch of them
[01:22.400 --> 01:25.600]  I don't know it's white guilt or something but it does seem to be towards black people that
[01:25.600 --> 01:30.800]  almost all the stories are about african-americans use politically correct term but that dovetails
[01:30.800 --> 01:36.480]  with this poor lady that Obama didn't help she would try to go to the inauguration she begged
[01:36.480 --> 01:41.040]  for help other people bought into the fact that it was republican state house members that that
[01:41.040 --> 01:44.800]  were in real estate that actually bought her a nice house just gave her a house to prove
[01:44.800 --> 01:48.400]  you know the fact that they're not what Obama claims they are these big racist and he's
[01:48.400 --> 01:53.360]  out in the news giving interviews to Fareed Zarkaria about how you know people in the south are
[01:53.360 --> 01:59.040]  racist they're not in the north which is the most twisted bizarre statement ever I'm going to say
[01:59.040 --> 02:05.600]  this I personally have witnessed more systemic open racism when I've been in the north than I've
[02:05.600 --> 02:12.160]  seen in the south now I'm not bashing the north either it's just that I've heard more open racism
[02:12.160 --> 02:17.280]  by everybody kind of at each other's throats than I've seen the south now it's the south more
[02:17.280 --> 02:23.200]  segregated certainly I'm not defending stuff it's just that it's such big broad brushstrokes but
[02:23.200 --> 02:29.040]  this is seeing in this is eight years ago woman who pled to Obama is still struggling
[02:30.400 --> 02:36.480]  Henrietta Hughes she's like we we live in the car and we go to the library and try to educate
[02:36.480 --> 02:42.000]  our children but we sure need a home the welfare doesn't pay for it and I I've got a job but then
[02:42.000 --> 02:46.400]  if I claim that then I won't have enough to even live because that's how they want you having to
[02:46.400 --> 02:52.240]  work and have welfare and then be homeless he said we're gonna take care of you man we're gonna
[02:52.240 --> 02:58.080]  take care you didn't take care of it you can bet your bottom dollar if Donald Trump tells somebody
[02:58.080 --> 03:03.520]  he's gonna take care of him he doesn't this isn't a Donald Trump love fest either it's just the
[03:03.520 --> 03:10.960]  reality he's working 18 hours a day in fact it's worse than that or better depending on how you
[03:10.960 --> 03:18.400]  look at it he works he's up working off and on 20 hours a day he does sleep four hours that's confirmed
[03:19.920 --> 03:26.240]  four hours now there's it isn't 20 hours of peer work as he stops and does stuff and eats and takes
[03:26.240 --> 03:30.320]  a few breaks here and there and you know takes a you know an extra shower or whatever like anybody
[03:30.320 --> 03:34.800]  would do is work in 20 hours and sometimes he goes and plays golf back before he ran for office
[03:34.800 --> 03:40.400]  had played golf down over a year and a half but I mean think about that juxtaposed to how much
[03:40.400 --> 03:45.360]  Bill Clinton vacationed or George Herbert Walker Bush vacationed or W Bush vacationed or any of
[03:45.360 --> 03:52.240]  these people or Obama the king of it it's just night and day it's action versus talk
[03:54.800 --> 04:00.960]  little less talk a little more action that gets me the satisfaction to quote the king
[04:02.720 --> 04:07.280]  so we're gonna play those clips coming up meanwhile CNN spends election cycle calling Trump
[04:07.280 --> 04:16.080]  supporters racist then gets hit with a class action racism suit yet not a lot of black faces
[04:16.080 --> 04:20.800]  or brown faces behind the scenes at CNN so that's some of the news we're going to be covering uh
[04:20.800 --> 04:28.400]  there today now before we go any further let me just tell you that's not even our top stories
[04:29.440 --> 04:34.160]  that is not even our top stories we have a democratic congressman on Fox News to Tucker
[04:34.160 --> 04:40.640]  Carlson's face that Tucker is finally blooming being left alone to be himself that's why he used
[04:40.640 --> 04:44.400]  to have to play along at CNN play along at Fox and there's even a real Tucker as I've told people
[04:44.400 --> 04:48.960]  you would it's it's very exciting ratings are exploding it's amazing oh a new patriot show top
[04:48.960 --> 04:56.160]  ratings on Fox the bimbo's ratings are going down he wants to watch Skeletor and drag he calls
[04:56.160 --> 05:04.080]  him a commie agent on his own show buzzfeed says white people are a plague to the planet in a

[05:31.120 --> 05:38.080]  produced a video on youtube that shamed white people for being arrogant controlling and selfish

[08:56.880 --> 09:01.920]  that's seen reassurgents in his popularity since the 80s and 90s but i've seen this guy host everything

[09:08.160 --> 09:17.120]  fellow austinite to give his view on the world today now i say this every show and i'm always mad
[09:17.120 --> 09:22.240]  at the other broadcasts i never do it on a good show i might cover a hundred news articles usually
[09:22.240 --> 09:28.640]  20 or 30 i've got to cover all this today there's so much good news there's so much serious news so
[09:28.640 --> 09:35.200]  much dangerous news so much ugliness but but overall it's there's a theme of positive things
[09:35.200 --> 09:42.720]  happening and accelerated awakening so i want to go over a lot of this today at the bottom of the
[09:42.720 --> 09:48.800]  hour remember the poor little black lady in florida saying i'm homeless i have a job but it
[09:48.800 --> 09:54.720]  doesn't pay for me to get a house so i have welfare and i'm living out of my car with my kids can you
[09:54.720 --> 10:00.560]  help me get a house he says oh we're going to help you we're going to help you all right never helped
[10:00.560 --> 10:07.120]  her but a republican state rep did and just moderate 200 something thousand dollar house
[10:08.080 --> 10:11.760]  this show of course it is conservatives that are six times more likely to actually give
[10:11.760 --> 10:16.240]  liberals just tell you how they give all day that dub tells what a black homeless woman
[10:17.920 --> 10:22.880]  says trump allowed her to live in trump tower rent free for eight years i've been told about this
[10:22.880 --> 10:28.640]  story and others that trump acts like this big tough guy on tv and everything and he is in business
[10:28.640 --> 10:34.560]  against what he sees as big bullies and other aggressive people that try to scam him uh but um
[10:35.520 --> 10:41.200]  trumps actually a big softy gets tears in his eyes and is just constantly giving away large
[10:41.200 --> 10:46.480]  portions of his fortune directly to poor people and folks try to get trump to stop doing it for at
[10:46.480 --> 10:52.080]  least 20 years because word gets out in new york let's just say that so this is why this was not
[10:52.080 --> 10:56.960]  used in the campaign uh trumps big soft side let me tell you something folks they've got his
[10:56.960 --> 11:02.800]  m o they've got a psychological profile that's why they're flipping out scared of him he wants
[11:02.800 --> 11:11.520]  everybody to be prosperous but he's so fair-minded that when chuck jones that snot knows union had
[11:11.520 --> 11:18.160]  of the steel workers in indianapolis when he only saved 1080 something of the 1400 jobs
[11:18.160 --> 11:24.320]  when that guy couldn't save it and obama could care less for carrier he bitched him out on cnn
[11:24.320 --> 11:33.120]  and said you lied you lost 300 jobs and trump hit back and said you didn't even try to keep him
[11:33.120 --> 11:38.000]  you're the reason everything's fleeing you in great the media's like hell hell hateful
[11:38.000 --> 11:43.200]  that's that's how a man is supposed to that's exactly how i would respond you didn't even
[11:43.200 --> 11:47.520]  care to keep these jobs obama didn't lift a finger made fun of me for a magic wand and
[11:47.520 --> 11:54.720]  then you say i'm a liar what the hell's your problem it's like we got spoiled kids and you go buy
[11:54.720 --> 11:58.400]  them something really nice and they gripe at you right after you they you know the they take the
[11:58.400 --> 12:03.760]  tree out for you know the the the the new bike out from under the christmas tree or the train set
[12:03.760 --> 12:09.600]  this isn't the train set i wanted well sorry they were out of the one you wanted this one cost even
[12:09.600 --> 12:17.760]  more money i mean it is the entitlement makes me just so angry and to sit there and watch
[12:17.760 --> 12:22.800]  how they take everything and twist it and i guess i have kinship with trump because if you're
[12:22.800 --> 12:30.080]  actually in the media or out on the tip of the spear in the arena you experience the very same
[12:30.080 --> 12:36.400]  stuff collectively but you know as a libertarian as a conservative as a constitutionalist as a
[12:36.400 --> 12:43.360]  veteran as a gun owner you are part of that club too of being demonized and attacked and i say
[12:43.360 --> 12:52.000]  let's just own it like it's a medal of honor because these people are despicable so that's
[12:52.000 --> 12:56.240]  coming up now that's just two of the articles i have there's hundreds of these things they're
[12:56.240 --> 13:03.360]  unbelievable look at uber i read the terms and services about a year ago on it and uninstalled
[13:03.360 --> 13:10.480]  it on my little traveling surveillance system known as a smartphone because it said we may choose
[13:11.280 --> 13:17.760]  to switch it on and off and monitor where your location when we want before it said when you
[13:17.760 --> 13:24.640]  activate the app then we track your location now uber has just flipped the switch with the trojan
[13:24.640 --> 13:30.720]  horse and is announced everywhere you go it tracks you 24 hours a day and logs where you're going
[13:30.720 --> 13:36.000]  it's now turned out it's been used in divorce cases you name it they're also selling the data to
[13:36.000 --> 13:40.880]  other companies so it's total data mining they've opened up their own little private NSA and that's
[13:40.880 --> 13:49.760]  why uber should go away i want competition but but they with uh you know the whole mafia system
[13:49.760 --> 13:59.440]  that ubers become and with uh folks like ramanual's brother are just absolutely gaming people up one
[13:59.440 --> 14:05.200]  side and down the other and people should really not use uber it goes in and gets monopolies in
[14:05.200 --> 14:13.440]  cities to be the only uh open source uh type computer system that there can be that circumvents
[14:13.440 --> 14:19.760]  taxis i say let it be a free for all let the market decide it and the market should say to uber
[14:19.760 --> 14:27.040]  i will take a regular taxi or i will walk or i will take a bus or i will call a black car service
[14:27.040 --> 14:34.880]  before i will use uber because you are uber bad uber surveillance again that's just one of the
[14:34.880 --> 14:42.320]  articles we have cash is no longer king the phasing out of physical money has begun lost and found
[14:42.320 --> 14:49.760]  japan tags dementia suffers with barcodes survey reveals americans don't trust scientists on GMOs
[14:49.760 --> 14:56.720]  China claims it needs more nuclear weapons to deal with trump this is the type of articles
[14:56.720 --> 15:04.320]  i've got i haven't even begun here now let's get to some of the good news here climate
[15:05.440 --> 15:12.480]  changest that's their political group or i guess religion are throwing fits over trumps epa pick
[15:12.480 --> 15:20.880]  dan lineman in full wars dot com scott pruit threatens future of global warming agenda and he's
[15:20.880 --> 15:26.960]  the attorney general of oklahoma he's about to be the new epa chief and he's come out just like
[15:26.960 --> 15:33.040]  sins are in off and said it's a total fraud there's always climate change why are we the only one
[15:33.040 --> 15:38.080]  shutting off our power plants and ours are totally clean and china's in mexico are totally dirty this
[15:38.080 --> 15:42.960]  is bull even if you believe the carbon dioxide is you know killing the earth when it actually is what
[15:42.960 --> 15:48.960]  plants breathe so they call him a climate change denialist first it was there if it was going to
[15:48.960 --> 15:54.560]  freeze then it was going to be global warming in the 90s and 2000s now it's just we're denying climate
[15:54.560 --> 16:01.680]  change no there's always been climate change the earth generally was hotter it's been in a cooling
[16:01.680 --> 16:09.120]  cycle but there are sub cycles within it the sun is on an 11 year cycle 120 year cycle the astrophysicists
[16:09.120 --> 16:15.920]  know this but they sit there and talk to you like your two-year-olds and say the latest globalist
[16:15.920 --> 16:22.160]  witch hunt is on as the new york times declared incoming epa head scott pruit a climate change
[16:22.160 --> 16:30.320]  denialist so if you say obama care isn't free and there are no death panels and no irs penalties
[16:30.320 --> 16:36.800]  even though there are you are fake news if you do not agree with hillary you're alt right they define
[16:36.800 --> 16:43.200]  reality because they said so and if you are a climate change denialist even though none of us
[16:43.200 --> 16:47.840]  deny that climate changes they've now just written it's so broad where you know they can't ever be
[16:47.840 --> 16:53.200]  wrong if it goes up goes down stays the same as a matter tornado storms it's all your fault
[16:53.200 --> 16:57.120]  they come out and say hurricanes are an all-time high they're an all-time recorded love the last
[16:57.120 --> 17:01.680]  hundred years that's the weather channel doesn't matter they just tell you look at the hurricanes
[17:01.680 --> 17:10.240]  i'm leonardo de caprio look at me i'm a child star i go to rock concerts i have rosy red cheeks
[17:11.120 --> 17:16.560]  listen to me i'm a scientist i mean what is this
[17:16.560 --> 17:27.360]  and so he's a denial of the new york times info wars dot com and there are dozens of sites not
[17:27.360 --> 17:32.720]  just mine is bigger than the new york times online and their paper edition is a small part of them
[17:32.720 --> 17:37.200]  so info wars is bigger than the new york times but the only way that they're a little bit bigger
[17:37.200 --> 17:41.840]  than info wars in reality is it's still the talking point for the entire mainstream media
[17:41.840 --> 17:47.360]  but as standalone their talking point memo that is the new york times info wars is bigger online
[17:47.360 --> 17:53.040]  according to quantcast and all the major services it's a total delusion but still conservatives go
[17:53.040 --> 17:59.040]  oh my gosh i'm through attacking me in the new york times alex how you take it you're getting

[24:35.440 --> 24:40.800]  but uh we've got people out there like hillary clinton who's now giving speeches all over the
[24:40.800 --> 24:46.800]  country we're going to play it here in a moment saying that we should ban fake news and ban the
[24:46.800 --> 24:54.480]  alt right and brian williams goes on tv who was caught in 20 something major lies once they
[24:54.480 --> 24:59.920]  started investigating the fact that he said that he was shot down by a rocket propelled grenade
[24:59.920 --> 25:08.880]  or rpg over iraq in a helicopter shot down by an rpg then it was he was two hours behind
[25:08.880 --> 25:14.160]  a helicopter that was shot down and then he wasn't even behind a helicopter that was shot down
[25:15.200 --> 25:19.600]  but this is what he sits around and tells people hillary does the same thing we really
[25:19.600 --> 25:24.480]  should take the two of them and combine them together in a little video i was
[25:24.480 --> 25:31.440]  shot down by a rocket propelled grenade and show hillary i was in bosnia under sniper fire and
[25:31.440 --> 25:35.200]  then it shows they're getting off the plane it's not true and then cut to them talking about fake
[25:35.200 --> 25:44.240]  news that's a promo we're gonna cut today for the nightly news but first let's go to michael more
[25:46.400 --> 25:52.720]  if this isn't a threat i don't know what is he comes out and he says you know something could
[25:52.720 --> 26:01.360]  happen to trump in the next what is it 40 41 days let me check my calendar here 41 days 41 days
[26:01.360 --> 26:11.360]  trust my memory but verify 41 days until 45 actually gets in and his lord ship
[26:11.360 --> 26:21.840]  the star of return of the jedi java michael more huttus hypocritus maximus
[26:23.760 --> 26:27.760]  says something crazy could happen to stop trump becoming president
[26:27.760 --> 26:31.200]  this is the same guy that predicted he would actually win because he knew the polls were
[26:31.200 --> 26:38.480]  faking he knew the inside baseball so let's go ahead and play his lord ship fine i you know i
[26:38.480 --> 26:43.680]  made that prediction and yeah you did you make him you called it uh so i'd like to make another one
[26:43.680 --> 26:47.280]  right tonight we're very excited and get your moan on audience
[26:50.640 --> 26:53.200]  yeah they're probably practice yeah um
[26:54.880 --> 26:59.440]  he's not president of the united states yet yeah he's not president right
[26:59.440 --> 27:09.520]  he's not president till noon on january 20th of 2017 that is that is what are we this is uh
[27:09.520 --> 27:14.800]  wednesday night yeah so that's more than six weeks away would you not agree we regardless
[27:14.800 --> 27:19.040]  what side of the political fence you're on this has been the craziest election year it's certainly
[27:19.040 --> 27:25.760]  nothing anyone has predicted has happened yeah every the opposite has happened yes so is it possible
[27:25.760 --> 27:31.200]  just possible that in these next six weeks something else may happen yeah something crazy
[27:31.200 --> 27:36.720]  something we're not expecting okay so he says that
[27:39.520 --> 27:42.720]  no one predicted things accurately no i predicted them exactly accurately
[27:44.720 --> 27:54.400]  and so did anculture and so did matt drudge and so did uh jesse james and so did roger stone and
[27:54.400 --> 28:00.800]  so did a lot of other people see that's why you call us the fake news because we're way
[28:00.800 --> 28:05.520]  more accurate than you because we're not beholden to anybody except our audience and they want the
[28:05.520 --> 28:10.800]  truth we want the truth we want freedom we want low taxes we want to be able to live our lives as we
[28:10.800 --> 28:18.480]  see fit practice our religion not practice it we're americans stop calling us racists stop trying to
[28:18.480 --> 28:29.040]  create a racial divide but we've seen the new york times newsweek time magazine the la times
[28:29.040 --> 28:33.520]  so many publications i can't remember them all i know all those did it saying man somebody
[28:33.520 --> 28:38.000]  needs to kill trump somebody needs to put a bullet in there have been hollywood producers
[28:38.000 --> 28:43.760]  that go out and say i will pay for someone to kill him i'm serious here's my you know here's my facebook
[28:43.760 --> 28:50.080]  address yeah i'm ready to finance it i gotta be careful even saying that the mainstream media is
[28:50.080 --> 28:55.520]  so deceptive now folks they might even take what i just said and play it and say i said it that's
[28:55.520 --> 28:59.920]  the level of deception and then they're gonna wonder if something happens to trump or trump
[28:59.920 --> 29:04.160]  supporters who are being killed and beaten and burned out of their houses all over the country
[29:04.160 --> 29:09.680]  and then they sit there and go alex jones said a pizzeria had a torture dungeon under it and they
[29:09.680 --> 29:15.840]  were killing kids at comet ping pong i never said any such thing and my reporters didn't but see
[29:15.840 --> 29:21.680]  that's how they straw man to divert off all the other pedestrian emails and it's why people don't
[29:21.680 --> 29:28.240]  believe you not even the the the the brightest bulbs believe you anymore you had a six percent
[29:28.240 --> 29:36.240]  trust rate in a big national study by ap that of their own readers that said we don't trust you
[29:36.240 --> 29:42.640]  six percent that was before the election is it possible to be in negative numbers i mean you've
[29:42.640 --> 29:47.680]  got a few cult members following you when we come back we're gonna play hillary and ryan williams this
[29:47.680 --> 29:55.360]  is amazing this is gold the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network
[29:55.360 --> 30:06.720]  michael moore says something crazy could happen to stop trump from becoming president appearing
[30:06.720 --> 30:12.880]  on late night with seth mires left his filmmaker michael moore said the inauguration is more than
[30:12.880 --> 30:19.360]  six weeks away and it's possible that something crazy might happen to president elect donald trump
[30:19.360 --> 30:25.600]  something that we're not expecting i made that prediction yeah you made it you called it uh so
[30:25.600 --> 30:29.840]  i'd like to make another one right tonight we're very excited he's not president of the united
[30:29.840 --> 30:36.640]  states yet yeah he's not president right this has been the craziest election year it's certainly
[30:36.640 --> 30:43.200]  nothing anyone has predicted has happened yeah every the opposite has happened yes so is it possible

[33:23.920 --> 33:29.760]  by the way i've been so busy battling the globalist that i can't even keep track of all the attacks
[33:29.760 --> 33:35.120]  but let me just tell you the attacks that info wars dot com and and yours truly and my entire crew
[33:35.120 --> 33:45.920]  are under our son exaggerate ten times any previous record uh it it seemed to hit a crescendo
[33:45.920 --> 33:48.240]  the last two days it's gone down a little bit
[33:48.240 --> 33:56.560]  which i i think is terrible i i hope they actually intensify the attacks because it only
[33:56.560 --> 34:02.480]  drives their audience to us and they know that but they're they're so desperate to discredit us that
[34:03.520 --> 34:08.880]  they just can't help it but we've got big news on the censorship front that i'm going to get to
[34:08.880 --> 34:14.000]  that just broke at info wars dot com drudge report dot com linked to an article yesterday
[34:14.000 --> 34:21.680]  day where facebook was censoring links to our videos and articles and we had screenshots of
[34:21.680 --> 34:28.880]  them them officially doing it now reddit has reddit has made us verboten anything with alex
[34:28.880 --> 34:35.280]  jones or info wars dot com or my name is banned and it was big national news when they banned
[34:35.280 --> 34:43.280]  pizza game but now the EU came out on monday and they said you have 24 hours reddit google facebook
[34:43.280 --> 34:49.520]  twitter and over 100 other big tech companies that they listed to block info wars dot com
[34:49.520 --> 34:54.320]  bright bart and drudge and others and you know when bright bart gets blocked we do stories every day
[34:55.360 --> 35:03.120]  when they get kicked off of uh things like apple with their app or they get blocked or
[35:05.920 --> 35:11.920]  bmw or kellox comes out and boycotts them with advertising we're like hey stand stand for bright
[35:11.920 --> 35:16.880]  bart and then drudge links to him too and supports them and then i'm not seeing reciprocal love from
[35:16.880 --> 35:20.080]  bright bart but i'm just going to keep defending bright bart i like bright bart i like band and
[35:20.080 --> 35:25.280]  he doesn't really run it now i know that he's too busy running the country with trump but we the
[35:25.280 --> 35:32.160]  point is we're all in this together see if they would have arrested and put michael more in prison
[35:32.160 --> 35:38.800]  for his political film fair night nine eleven i would be standing up for his release but when
[35:38.800 --> 35:46.080]  dinesh to susie gets thrown in prison the young turks and michael more basically applaud it and
[35:46.080 --> 35:54.320]  call him a criminal and laugh at him this is crazy i mean people i don't like i don't want to be
[35:54.320 --> 36:03.280]  put in prison for their speech because duh it'll happen to me next so not griping at bright bart
[36:03.280 --> 36:06.960]  bright bart's had some nice articles about us and supported us some and then that's fine
[36:06.960 --> 36:10.960]  it isn't that i need their traffic i don't care about the traffic i hope they're ten times bigger
[36:10.960 --> 36:17.120]  than us okay i want to defeat the new world order i'm under attack worse than bright bart okay we're
[36:17.120 --> 36:21.920]  the front line they're demonizing us everywhere and starting to censor us all over the place and
[36:21.920 --> 36:27.280]  it's being done by stealth so that there's not any noise nobody knows where we go we just kind of
[36:27.280 --> 36:34.320]  blip off the radar screen that's how authoritarianism operates okay so buckley's technical on reddit
[36:34.320 --> 36:40.080]  loves ready he's a big redditor i like i like reddit too uh i'm kind of a moron when it comes to
[36:40.080 --> 36:43.520]  tech stuff and all the different platforms i just like to read the stuff i don't understand all the
[36:43.520 --> 36:51.600]  little idio syncratic stuff that you know goes on with it but i it's just wild to know no info
[36:51.600 --> 36:58.000]  wars links no prison planet links they just make the links invisible just like their censorship
[36:58.000 --> 37:03.600]  is invisible you just oh we're we're at alex go oh alex susie that's a conspiracy theory
[37:03.600 --> 37:12.320]  don't say that exists that's fake news so this is a big deal and i as i've said you know i spent
[37:13.440 --> 37:17.200]  quarter million dollars which sounds like a lot of money it's not on the rush limbaugh show
[37:17.200 --> 37:21.680]  to buy a month of advertising when there was a boycott against him now now two things happen
[37:21.680 --> 37:26.880]  because there's kind of a graph here people were paying at that time half as much as they were
[37:26.880 --> 37:32.080]  previously for limbaugh he was the middle of a giant controversy had record ratings this is like
[37:32.080 --> 37:37.520]  six years ago they were trying to kick you kick him off the air show the price of the advertising
[37:37.520 --> 37:42.400]  had gone down but the ratings had gone up so i'm an entrepreneur i want to make money to fund
[37:42.400 --> 37:49.040]  their operation and take care of my family so ratings are up cost is down i spent a quarter
[37:49.040 --> 37:54.080]  million dollars on the rush limbaugh show and made a whole point of doing it and then i got
[37:54.080 --> 38:01.920]  ted anderson to spend with his gold company a million that's a million two hundred thousand and fifty
[38:01.920 --> 38:09.200]  dollars or a million two hundred fifty thousand dollars and some of the public some of the listeners
[38:09.200 --> 38:13.760]  didn't get it they go you've sold out he's an establishment right winger what are you doing
[38:13.760 --> 38:19.920]  on there i said do you care if i'm advertising the truth about the new world order about globalism
[38:19.920 --> 38:26.800]  and promoting films that expose it aren't you glad oh i gotta see your point we're gonna change rush
[38:26.800 --> 38:31.440]  limbaugh we're gonna change shan hanity we're going to change tucker carlson we're going to
[38:31.440 --> 38:36.880]  make it safe for them to say what they really think because i happen to know behind the scenes
[38:36.880 --> 38:41.040]  they know everything we're talking about's accurate right exactly and that's where you know where do
[38:41.040 --> 38:45.280]  missionaries go they go where the heathens are right i mean we can sit here inside of our own
[38:45.280 --> 38:50.720]  bubble all day long and talk to each other and encourage each other but we need to get outside
[38:50.720 --> 38:56.000]  the world and go where everybody else is and sort of open them up to the ideas that we discuss here
[38:56.000 --> 39:02.320]  and so when alex is talking about how reddit has censored us it's really sort of a sneaky nefarious
[39:02.320 --> 39:07.840]  thing because what they've done is they've shadow banned any red any info wars links or any associations
[39:07.840 --> 39:12.160]  to alex and it was the reddit community that pointed this out to us exactly and what that means
[39:12.160 --> 39:17.760]  is that yes you can go into friendly subreddits such as the donald and the info wars subreddit
[39:18.560 --> 39:24.480]  and you can post info wars links but what happens is the bots go in and they and they
[39:24.480 --> 39:29.840]  downvote them boom boom boom boom which is against the terms of service there and then there's also
[39:29.840 --> 39:34.960]  these ctr people to correct the record people that hillary clinton has going into those into
[39:34.960 --> 39:39.600]  those subs and brigading them which means downvoting them more boom boom boom boom down
[39:39.600 --> 39:45.120]  and then secondarily what happens is in the shadow banning is is that it keeps those links
[39:45.120 --> 39:50.560]  inside of those subreddits so they never have the opportunity to go out of the subreddit and and get
[39:50.560 --> 39:55.520]  the exposure that any other link across reddit would get and so millions of people would be able
[39:55.520 --> 40:01.360]  to see them as opposed to the hundreds of thousands in the donald or uh the the the the reason they do
[40:01.360 --> 40:06.240]  this is in a free market of ideas we will be number one we're already number one and i'm not
[40:06.240 --> 40:12.480]  bragging listeners info wars if you add all of our platforms everything we do just our platforms
[40:12.480 --> 40:16.800]  not the other people that we allow to copy our stuff we need to do a true audit and really try
[40:16.800 --> 40:22.880]  to give people a more accurate number it's much bigger 40 plus million is our new baseline okay
[40:22.880 --> 40:29.120]  we go above that our top peak ever is almost it was like 84 plus million just on our platforms
[40:29.120 --> 40:36.400]  amfm shortwave internet youtube you know videos reddit all of it uh facebook videos all of it
[40:36.400 --> 40:44.800]  this is views not not impressions not reach not all those not not not not hits but but views
[40:44.800 --> 40:53.440]  views and listens actual real people listening 85 million now right and that's why they're in panic
[40:53.440 --> 41:00.240]  mode folks because so 40 million 40 million people a week that's the whole audience of mpr we're now
[41:00.240 --> 41:07.040]  as big as mpr that gets 400 plus million dollars from the government every year of your taxpayer
[41:07.040 --> 41:11.280]  money and then hundreds of millions of Rockefeller money and all the rest of it for a fraction of
[41:11.280 --> 41:16.960]  that we are annihilating them and they do not know what to do and we're growing and they're
[41:16.960 --> 41:22.160]  declining so their answer is just disappear us go ahead right and you know just to add to that
[41:22.160 --> 41:28.800]  is we actually did some metrics testing uh for the last last month and we came up with really solid
[41:28.800 --> 41:33.680]  numbers not not not blown up numbers to try to get advertising so we're really looking at it to
[41:33.680 --> 41:39.600]  analyze it for ourselves we was a certain person asked for it yeah and and we came up with in the
[41:39.600 --> 41:47.440]  last 30 days which does include the election cycle we reached around 380 million people 380 million
[41:47.440 --> 41:53.440]  individual views clicks on the website etc i mean that is a massive massive number and that also
[41:53.440 --> 41:58.560]  goes back into talking about reddit you know the subreddit of the donald which is the the acolytes
[41:58.560 --> 42:01.760]  of donald trump which have been in there they've been fighting they've been talking it's a wonderful
[42:01.760 --> 42:05.920]  subreddit i i really suggest anybody check it out they've taken reddit over with free speech
[42:05.920 --> 42:10.080]  and and and being funny and being interesting and now they're slowly being strangled by reddit
[42:10.080 --> 42:15.680]  exactly so so usually the posts that go on in there get hundreds of thousands of upvotes
[42:15.680 --> 42:20.400]  which means that everybody is supporting it and pushing it up and it used they used to dominate
[42:20.400 --> 42:24.960]  what's called the front page of reddit where anybody that goes on to reddit gets to see that
[42:24.960 --> 42:30.320]  and what they've done is they've they've clamped down and they've created new these new rules that
[42:30.320 --> 42:36.000]  only apply to people to support donald trump that crushes down the uh the exposure that they can
[42:36.000 --> 42:39.600]  get and by the way i have an idea i know how to counter them and i had this idea about 10 years
[42:39.600 --> 42:43.440]  ago on youtube and people did it for a while and it really works like we had google bombs that
[42:43.440 --> 42:47.520]  worked for two years and they changed the algorithm we have to keep testing i think we should start
[42:47.520 --> 42:54.000]  having some people with satire be really stupid and silly and start a reddit that's the anti trump
[42:54.000 --> 43:01.360]  anti info wars but only being there being sarcastic and just like yes horrible that he wants to
[43:01.360 --> 43:07.280]  cut taxes and roll these jobs back and just make it the most sickening satire that's pretty hilarious
[43:07.280 --> 43:11.760]  i totally agree with obama it was really hard being a community organizer getting old scholarships
[43:11.760 --> 43:16.080]  and then being run for state senate u.s senate and just six years later being president yeah he's
[43:16.080 --> 43:22.000]  got a lot of real world experience unlike that guy that works 20 hours a day and that's hundreds of
[43:22.000 --> 43:26.880]  thousands of employees and does all this stuff i don't know alex all that would be would be fake
[43:26.880 --> 43:32.240]  news like cnn and abc and msnc all we have to do is stop and stuff and just throw it on there
[43:32.240 --> 43:36.720]  that's the iron you know we're just looping around in this weird recursive psychological
[43:36.720 --> 43:42.320]  loop you know the bottom line is is that right now there there are very subtle attacks on our
[43:42.320 --> 43:46.560]  freedoms our freedom of speech us being able to go and i wouldn't call them subtle i'd call
[43:46.560 --> 43:52.800]  them stealth or giant the eu coming out saying all these platforms ban info wars bland you know
[43:52.800 --> 43:59.440]  uh ban drudge i mean they listed us the fricken unaccountable dictatorial eu superstate that's
[43:59.440 --> 44:04.640]  announced it's going to roll troops into france and germany and other countries if they try to
[44:04.640 --> 44:09.200]  leave the euro exactly i mean what this is incredible but here here is the heartening
[44:09.200 --> 44:13.120]  thing this is the beautiful thing and i don't remember exactly who said this quote and i'm
[44:13.120 --> 44:18.560]  going to misquote it but you know first they first they laugh at you then they ridicule you
[44:18.560 --> 44:22.560]  then they fight you and then you win is that how it goes yeah there's different variants but it's
[44:22.560 --> 44:26.160]  basically first they ignore you then they laugh at you then they attack you then you win and where
[44:26.160 --> 44:32.240]  are we right now they're attacking us right that's where we are i mean we are we already won
[44:32.240 --> 44:37.280]  we're donald trump he won the election twice he won it once and they did a recount and he
[44:37.280 --> 44:42.560]  got more votes so he won the election twice and then now they're fighting us as hard as they can
[44:42.560 --> 44:46.560]  and we're about to win because people are waking up all over the world so i agree they're they're
[44:46.560 --> 44:50.560]  desperately trying to restrict us thank you buckley and by the way i had this idea on monday

[54:42.560 --> 54:46.160]  starts it starts with something that sounds simple and sounds reasonable but then they

[01:00:51.040 --> 01:00:55.200]  so as bad as scarborough is he's a lot better than hillary even when i'm going off on him
[01:00:56.080 --> 01:00:59.840]  but at the same event yesterday where hillary said we got to go out for fake news
[01:00:59.840 --> 01:01:04.400]  afterwards her her supporters like cult members like kim jong un had died in north korea were like
[01:01:07.520 --> 01:01:12.080]  what about you they said you stole the money from the foundation which they had met you did

[01:01:30.160 --> 01:01:34.480]  so here's the end of her speech where the private sector government have to work together to shut
[01:01:34.480 --> 01:01:41.440]  off the fake news and it's happening bipartisan legislation is making its way through congress
[01:01:41.440 --> 01:01:46.960]  to boost the government's response to foreign propaganda and silicon valley is starting to grapple
[01:01:47.600 --> 01:01:55.040]  with the challenge and threat of fake news it's imperative that leaders in both the private sector
[01:01:55.040 --> 01:02:18.960]  and the public sector step up to protect our democracy and innocent lives
[01:02:18.960 --> 01:02:34.880]  like a war monk can we play that again she's like a war mongering demon
[01:02:49.280 --> 01:02:55.680]  can we cut this in with the north korea stuff later i want to get all our supporters the
[01:02:55.680 --> 01:03:02.880]  the night of the election after and then ongoing prying with loops of when kim jong un died now

[01:03:57.680 --> 01:04:04.240]  shooting at this dc pizzeria it has become terrifyingly clear that fake news has such
[01:04:04.240 --> 01:04:09.040]  real consequences according to buzzfeed and an analysis that they did in the three months before
[01:04:09.040 --> 01:04:14.960]  the 2016 presidential election articles with fake news from fake sources were shared at a
[01:04:14.960 --> 01:04:20.000]  higher rate than real news from us the so-called mainstream media and on facebook brian it was hard
[01:04:23.120 --> 01:04:29.040]  you know it was buzzfeed that said hillary had like a 97 chance of winning the new york times
[01:04:29.040 --> 01:04:36.320]  said 96 they had a special secret algorithm so fake news announced that fake news increased they

[01:08:38.880 --> 01:08:51.120]  joined us i i just played brian williams now suddenly back on NBC news the guy that got caught
[01:08:51.120 --> 01:08:56.800]  publishing 20 something fake stories lying to the public once he got investigated about being
[01:08:56.800 --> 01:09:05.760]  shot down by a rpg rocket propelled grenade in iraq and now he's on a crusade that's the headline
[01:09:05.760 --> 01:09:15.040]  against fake and false reporting i mean could it be any more arrogant these people are so arrogant
[01:09:15.600 --> 01:09:21.680]  he thinks because he looks like a serial killer which he thinks is handsome and he's wearing a nice
[01:09:21.680 --> 01:09:37.280]  tie and a $3,000 suit and has practiced a confident smile that he then can shovel manure down our
[01:09:37.280 --> 01:10:07.120]  throats and then hillary unknown fake news purveyor is running around and then you've got cobert who his whole career for 15 years he spent on comedy central versus a reporter then his own show posing now he's on one of the nightly networks on broadcast tv posing as a fake conservative as a strong man to discredit conservatives putting out
[01:10:07.120 --> 01:10:12.480]  fake news and making it a joke because it's entertainment you couldn't get away with that on normal tv until now
[01:10:14.320 --> 01:10:20.240]  and so he's really just on comedy central doing what anerson cooper does on cnn another fake reporter
[01:10:22.960 --> 01:10:28.720]  attacking yours truly for 15 minutes in one piece misrepresenting what we say
[01:10:28.720 --> 01:10:38.720]  misrepresenting what we do praying on his audience now use that word because they're hoping you don't look into it they're hoping you don't know

[01:11:35.040 --> 01:11:40.320]  ruins the enjoyment in my life let me tell you something people like us and that's most of us are like that
[01:11:44.160 --> 01:11:47.600]  our problem is we don't want to be in charge we don't want to be involved we just want to live our lives
[01:11:47.600 --> 01:11:52.160]  be successful have our friends we're so fulfilled we're like you know i don't want to run your life
[01:11:54.400 --> 01:11:57.200]  but the great analogy is the homeowners association
[01:11:59.600 --> 01:12:03.120]  when i was a kid there was this obnoxious homeowners association and this golf course
[01:12:03.120 --> 01:12:06.800]  was going to be lived in that was harassing people not letting people make changes on their houses
[01:12:06.800 --> 01:12:10.960]  that were reasonable a bunch of weird old people that were on power trips and they were really rude
[01:12:10.960 --> 01:12:17.760]  to my dad and got in his face so my dad went and knocked on over 600 doors it was a big neighborhood
[01:12:17.760 --> 01:12:24.480]  big back then that's a small golf community today and he got elected president fired all those people
[01:12:24.480 --> 01:12:31.600]  put new people in and resigned in one month and they always think they're invincible these
[01:12:31.600 --> 01:12:37.280]  homeowners associations i've run into one as of late they'll come and cuss at you in your face and

[01:12:43.200 --> 01:12:48.880]  that's bad that's an old man it's just like they just think they're god in this position and imagine
[01:12:48.880 --> 01:12:52.880]  it goes from homeowners association right up to the top
[01:12:55.920 --> 01:12:58.560]  you're gonna call the police because i'm in your property yelling and screaming because

[01:14:14.400 --> 01:14:21.520]  algorithm that your computers don't tell you i know the spirit of 1776 and you're gonna feel it
[01:14:21.520 --> 01:14:29.760]  but you are feeling it they're panic they're screaming like dying dogs at hillary's speech where
[01:14:29.760 --> 01:14:34.000]  she called for the government and congress to pass laws to shut him full wars calm down
[01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:40.320]  we're listed by name she's listed me by name before and they're coming and it's already happening
[01:14:40.320 --> 01:14:48.080]  but it shows everybody like a big giant neon sign flashing the good eats are in here
[01:14:48.080 --> 01:14:55.840]  not on the cockroach filled halls of cnn now let's get into the really exciting news right now
[01:14:57.040 --> 01:14:59.920]  i've been a good boy about skipping breaks lately but on this friday i'm gonna skip this
[01:14:59.920 --> 01:15:05.040]  one because i'm gonna have time to take calls at the bottom of the hour this is really really
[01:15:05.040 --> 01:15:14.320]  important and i want to get to this right now donald trump never used any of this in the campaign
[01:15:14.320 --> 01:15:21.120]  and quite frankly i know the inside baseball that his friends and associates say look we know
[01:15:21.120 --> 01:15:25.680]  you give to big charities privately and we know you give the police groups and firefighter groups
[01:15:25.680 --> 01:15:33.600]  and veterans groups probably and that's fine the giving massively directly to people on the street
[01:15:35.600 --> 01:15:39.200]  sometimes on a daily basis i mean we're talking reportedly it's in the hundreds and hundreds
[01:15:39.200 --> 01:15:44.000]  and hundreds of millions a year in some cases he's super hard nose with other business people
[01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:50.320]  and other regressive sharks but then when it comes to common poor people or people that are nice to
[01:15:50.320 --> 01:15:59.680]  him donald trump has a big heart he's got that mix that any real man's got and so i was told years
[01:15:59.680 --> 01:16:03.600]  ago about donald trump being a patriot i rolled my eyes i don't follow mainstream pop stuff i
[01:16:03.600 --> 01:16:07.200]  thought of him as you know the apprentice hosts the rest of it so i just i just you know wasn't
[01:16:07.200 --> 01:16:11.360]  well versed in at all i didn't know he was against napton gatton gave all this money to do it and
[01:16:11.360 --> 01:16:17.200]  and you know was concerned forever about communism and globalism and learned about it from one of
[01:16:17.200 --> 01:16:23.760]  mccarty's former top people and there's a new york times articles about that but this guy really
[01:16:23.760 --> 01:16:32.720]  formed during that whole period in the 60s post mccarty and was led in on a lot of secret congressional
[01:16:32.720 --> 01:16:36.880]  inside baseball if you want to go look that up you can go do your own research new york times
[01:16:36.880 --> 01:16:45.680]  is written about it now they've asked him they said please stop feeding the homeless in trump tower
[01:16:45.680 --> 01:16:52.880]  he's like no i own it i'm gonna do it please stop buying people houses please i mean because the word
[01:16:52.880 --> 01:16:58.320]  gets out and so there's people they're coming and if they can actually get hold of trump or have him
[01:16:58.320 --> 01:17:03.760]  be seen oh and he sits there and judges him and talks to him about judges i mean you know gets
[01:17:03.760 --> 01:17:09.200]  their bearings but most of time he ends up giving him stuff and sometimes it's a thousand dollars
[01:17:09.200 --> 01:17:16.480]  sometimes it's a house sometimes it's a car it's crazy and if donald trump tells you something
[01:17:16.480 --> 01:17:21.200]  by the way you can bank he's going to do it or die trying so there's been articles now written
[01:17:21.200 --> 01:17:29.440]  about it post election donald trump saved my family widow's daughter recalls how the donald paid off
[01:17:29.440 --> 01:17:33.840]  her mom's 300 000 mortgage after her father committed suicide i mean there's just there's hundreds of
[01:17:33.840 --> 01:17:40.000]  these i i can't even keep track of them all uh you know a family sees his limousine broke down
[01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:47.840]  they pull over and helping tell them they're fans of his show he gets their card i think like what
[01:17:47.840 --> 01:17:52.480]  i've got the article here a quarter million dollar mortgage he paid off the next week they just it's
[01:17:52.480 --> 01:18:00.240]  paid for i don't have time to go over all of these i mean there's a bunch of them uh these acts of
[01:18:00.240 --> 01:18:06.240]  kindness reveal there's more to donald trump than justice celebrity persona and then it's people that
[01:18:06.240 --> 01:18:11.120]  are on drugs and he pays for the rehab it's uh airlines would accommodate a boy with serious
[01:18:11.120 --> 01:18:17.520]  mental issues so trump that gave him his jet uh he gave sanctuary to a grammy award-winning singer
[01:18:17.520 --> 01:18:22.800]  jennifer hudson after three of her family members were murdered uh he helped save a family's working
[01:18:22.800 --> 01:18:30.720]  farm it was going into foreclosure after sergeant andrew was released from prison in mexico the
[01:18:30.720 --> 01:18:36.720]  donald sent him a big check to help get him back on his feet what trump did for a bus driver helped
[01:18:36.720 --> 01:18:43.520]  save a woman from jumping off a bridge oh wait i've been told about stuff that nobody even knows
[01:18:43.520 --> 01:18:48.960]  about and i'm not and i'm not and i'm telling you it's almost like he just does it so compulsively
[01:18:48.960 --> 01:18:53.280]  that people around him are like just don't let him get around or we'll never even get to the next
[01:18:53.280 --> 01:18:59.280]  meeting okay so this is what goes on now and he's known he's gotten awards from jessie jackson for
[01:18:59.280 --> 01:19:03.440]  hiring uh you know large amounts of african-americans and other minorities and promoting them if they've
[01:19:03.440 --> 01:19:08.800]  got the skills in which he gives them the time to get the skills in training that's why the
[01:19:08.800 --> 01:19:15.840]  globalist hating folks he wants prosperity and he isn't out to get little people and they know that
[01:19:15.840 --> 01:19:21.280]  and they dug up stuff on trump that they didn't put in the tabloids because it would only make him
[01:19:21.280 --> 01:19:28.560]  look good i'm gonna leave it right there but you see what bill clinton did with his connections
[01:19:28.560 --> 01:19:36.160]  to black people totally turned his back on him not with donald trump now i'm gonna stop right there
[01:19:36.160 --> 01:19:44.480]  let's continue here here's the new articles that's up on info wars dot com nobody knows about this
[01:19:44.480 --> 01:19:49.200]  black homeless woman says trump allowed her to live in trump tower rent free for eight years
[01:19:51.280 --> 01:19:56.080]  we're gonna play the video in a moment but first i want to play the first video
[01:19:56.080 --> 01:20:11.760]  this is a lady henryetta hughes this is cnn woman who pled to obama is still struggling
[01:20:12.480 --> 01:20:17.440]  henryetta hughes caught the nation's attention in february when she cried for help during one of
[01:20:17.440 --> 01:20:23.040]  obama's town hall meetings after a plea hughes was given a free home to live in temporarily
[01:20:23.040 --> 01:20:27.200]  but she is still struggling to find a job and then there was republicans that came and actually
[01:20:27.200 --> 01:20:32.080]  got her house and a member of the news it wasn't even cnn and others didn't even give credit to them
[01:20:32.080 --> 01:20:35.920]  they just said oh she's in a temporary home and then they bought her house see how the deception
[01:20:35.920 --> 01:20:41.280]  works hughes who was sixties faithfully goes to an employment center in fort mires and hopes of
[01:20:41.280 --> 01:20:46.960]  finding a job and then she doesn't living out of her car so there's a black lady getting three
[01:20:46.960 --> 01:20:54.240]  meals a day paid for by trump in a furnished area in an office area that she was caught
[01:20:54.240 --> 01:20:59.120]  squatting and he just turned it into a house floor it's got a bathroom hold nine yards that's what
[01:20:59.120 --> 01:21:03.920]  that's what trump's done in trump tower when he found out the cops were hauling her out of
[01:21:03.920 --> 01:21:12.560]  there and evicting her and he's so hands-on when she wouldn't leave they called trump and he came down
[01:21:12.560 --> 01:21:18.160]  this doesn't fit with the media's portrayal of trump as a racist bigot a homeless black woman
[01:21:18.160 --> 01:21:22.320]  reveals that she's been living in trump tower for eight years with the blessings of the donnell
[01:21:22.320 --> 01:21:27.360]  himself telling from a hotel window the woman says she originally snuck into the building
[01:21:27.360 --> 01:21:32.320]  before becoming a squatter in one of the empty rooms police arrived the next day and told the
[01:21:32.320 --> 01:21:37.360]  woman to leave or she'd be arrested when i told them i would not go they contacted mr trump
[01:21:37.360 --> 01:21:43.120]  from the phone he came down here instead of evicting me off the property he said i can stay
[01:21:43.120 --> 01:21:47.680]  it's been eight years i've been here the woman reveals not only did he not evict me off the
[01:21:47.680 --> 01:21:52.480]  property he made sure that i ate three meals a day by a room service and that i get a delivery of
[01:21:52.480 --> 01:21:56.880]  fresh flowers every week she adds see trump can't stand seeing people in squalor
[01:21:59.280 --> 01:22:03.520]  he's not surrounded by all the gold and and the stuff because he wants to be better than people
[01:22:03.520 --> 01:22:07.440]  like the other leaders it's because that's what he likes to see you can say wow that's pretty
[01:22:07.440 --> 01:22:11.600]  grandiose okay he wants to be grandiose to everybody else which if humans want something
[01:22:11.600 --> 01:22:16.080]  we can have it folks you understand that we can build anything we want it's economies of scale
[01:22:18.080 --> 01:22:21.440]  if it weren't for him i'd be homeless i'd be dead right now i'd be on the street she says
[01:22:21.440 --> 01:22:28.320]  hang with trump hasn't asked me to pay a dime donnell trump is not a bad guy he's a wonderful
[01:22:28.320 --> 01:22:34.400]  wonderful man everything i'm telling you here today is true she concludes trump is renowned
[01:22:34.400 --> 01:22:38.080]  for his acts of kindness towards people in unfortunate circumstances although the mainstream
[01:22:38.080 --> 01:22:44.240]  media is low dimension after oscar winning actress jennifer hudson's brother and mother
[01:22:44.240 --> 01:22:49.280]  were murdered 2008 trump offered a hotel suite for hudson her family and it goes on and on and
[01:22:49.280 --> 01:22:54.880]  that's nothing and you know it's not known that mel Gibson's given like i shouldn't even see this
[01:22:54.880 --> 01:22:58.480]  was like years ago and it's inside stuff and a little bit of it came out so i'll just tell you
[01:22:59.120 --> 01:23:03.360]  i think it's like last time i heard 10 million dollars from the i know the family is dad of
[01:23:03.360 --> 01:23:08.560]  myself people 10 million dollars for kids to get organ transplants and brain surgeries and stuff
[01:23:08.560 --> 01:23:14.640]  just in california alone and that's just what they know about but i mean obviously the guys got
[01:23:14.640 --> 01:23:20.640]  billions of dollars but the point is is that conservatives are six times more likely major
[01:23:20.640 --> 01:23:25.360]  studies actually give money to people to actually help them liberals all virtue signals they're
[01:23:25.360 --> 01:23:29.440]  going to give you money all day because they're not liberals these terms mean nothing uh so here's
[01:23:29.440 --> 01:23:35.440]  the lady that conservatives had to come help because obama wouldn't henry had a huge during uh
[01:23:35.440 --> 01:23:41.360]  the campaign right before obama got elected here it is thank you very much i first want to say
[01:23:42.240 --> 01:23:48.000]  i i respect you and i'm so grateful for you thank you big prayer for you but i believe in prayer so
[01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:56.160]  i appreciate it i have an urgent need an employment and homelessness a very small vehicle for my
[01:23:56.160 --> 01:24:02.480]  family and i delivered we need urgent and housing authorities have two years waiting to listen
[01:24:03.840 --> 01:24:09.520]  we need something more than the vehicle and the parks to go to we need our own kitchen and our own
[01:24:09.520 --> 01:24:18.960]  bathroom please help well i listen what's your name what's your name it's henry at a huge oh goodness
[01:24:18.960 --> 01:24:23.280]  huge well we're going to do everything we can to help you but there are a lot of people like you
[01:24:31.920 --> 01:24:34.720]  the weird white lady's like going i love you obama like sexually
[01:24:34.720 --> 01:24:40.000]  mean while black unemployment right at it didn't quite double it right at double
[01:24:43.920 --> 01:24:49.840]  and just absolutely he thinks he's just got you it's the arrogance he could have had a huge pr
[01:24:49.840 --> 01:24:59.280]  win getting her a job somewhere but no no the told rich donors hey get her a job those you'd
[01:24:59.280 --> 01:25:05.360]  had one no because they think they've already got you they're arrogant
[01:25:07.200 --> 01:25:12.240]  meanwhile they've announced 10 billion dollars in us steel moving back next year that this is
[01:25:12.240 --> 01:25:19.040]  four he's even on office 41 days out carriers coming back two forward plants now 50 billion
[01:25:19.040 --> 01:25:28.160]  in japanese investment in high-tech uh cutting-edge systems from robotics to chips to communications
[01:25:28.160 --> 01:25:36.640]  that'll be in america with americans and it goes on and on restaurants are seeing a 35 40 percent
[01:25:36.640 --> 01:25:42.400]  increase christmas uh purchasing suddenly started skyrocketing it's the trump effect optimism the
[01:25:42.400 --> 01:25:46.480]  globalists want to kill optimism while telling you the economy is great they know we've been in a
[01:25:46.480 --> 01:25:52.800]  quasi depression for nine years and yeah it started before obama and he continued the exact same
[01:25:52.800 --> 01:26:00.560]  thing as the same banks run him but now there's a new sheriff in town people say well i thought it's
[01:26:00.560 --> 01:26:05.040]  a new world order they're invincible no we're here to take over we're here to change things we're
[01:26:05.040 --> 01:26:10.480]  here to restore the republic we can win if we just believe in it people don't believe they could ever
[01:26:10.480 --> 01:26:16.800]  do anything you've got to have motivation we're promoting freedom and prosperity and live in
[01:26:16.800 --> 01:26:23.200]  your own life and and being self-sufficient that's a lot sexier than standing in government lines and
[01:26:23.200 --> 01:26:30.720]  being a slave now here's the lady in trump tower that's been there for eight years showing folks
[01:26:30.720 --> 01:26:36.080]  where she lives and how trump takes care of her and again it's she's not the only one and so it is
[01:26:36.080 --> 01:26:42.880]  becoming an issue because well this is just what trump does but then they'll have some you know guys
[01:26:42.880 --> 01:26:47.120]  some architect tries to triple charge trump off what he agreed to architects are famous for that
[01:26:47.120 --> 01:26:50.480]  they're not all bad but boy they're they're famous for being some of the biggest weasels out there
[01:26:50.480 --> 01:26:54.960]  aren't they you've ever worked with them you know what i'm talking about uh builders seem to be great
[01:26:54.960 --> 01:27:03.360]  but it's the architects and well i'm digressing let me go to this video here it is hi everybody
[01:27:03.360 --> 01:27:15.440]  i am a squatter in donald trump's building trump tower in new york city as you can see
[01:27:17.680 --> 01:27:24.560]  i'm in my pajamas uh there's sentry park right there
[01:27:24.560 --> 01:27:35.920]  there and that tall building is the s6 house the sentry park west near 59th street
[01:27:40.800 --> 01:27:48.320]  i came in here about nine years ago and snuck in the building and
[01:27:48.320 --> 01:27:53.840]  and just started occupying one of the empty rooms in here
[01:27:57.360 --> 01:28:04.000]  by the time our housekeeper noticed i was here the next day
[01:28:05.760 --> 01:28:10.400]  she called the manager and they called the new york city police
[01:28:10.400 --> 01:28:20.720]  who came up here and told me i had to leave or i would be arrested
[01:28:24.800 --> 01:28:26.720]  but i told him i would not go
[01:28:29.040 --> 01:28:32.720]  they contacted mr trump over the phone
[01:28:32.720 --> 01:28:37.840]  and he came down here
[01:28:40.640 --> 01:28:43.440]  instead of him evicting me off the property
[01:28:45.360 --> 01:28:46.960]  he said that i can stay
[01:28:49.120 --> 01:28:58.320]  and it's been eight years i've been here not only did he not evict me off the property
[01:28:58.320 --> 01:29:05.440]  he made sure that i get eight three meals a day
[01:29:07.680 --> 01:29:14.400]  my room service and that i get a delivery of fresh flowers every week
[01:29:17.760 --> 01:29:18.720]  so you people
[01:29:18.720 --> 01:29:27.120]  that a bad guy at all all right let's stop right there
[01:29:28.240 --> 01:29:32.320]  the full video she goes on to say what a great guy he is and how people are lying about him
[01:29:32.320 --> 01:29:37.760]  now the thing about trump is she's obviously got health issues and some and some handicap issues
[01:29:38.400 --> 01:29:43.120]  that's who trump helps now just like that when i see humbles that actually have their legs missing
[01:29:43.120 --> 01:29:46.560]  i give them money i don't give it to just some drug addict it's the same thing with trump that

[01:33:48.080 --> 01:33:53.040]  are here so i'm very very excited about that i should take some calls if i said i was going to
[01:33:53.040 --> 01:33:59.600]  take calls what do you make of this media war and hillary sink censor uh the alt right media again
[01:33:59.600 --> 01:34:05.680]  why is she able to define what is now meant to be censored and the list they're using is a list
[01:34:05.680 --> 01:34:10.880]  that the washington post is now retracted and admitted isn't accurate that's a pretty big deal
[01:34:10.880 --> 01:34:16.480]  i want to play it's like a 10 minute clip i want to play the last two minutes of it and i'm not
[01:34:16.480 --> 01:34:21.520]  fawning after tucker carlson it's just the tucker carlson i know behind the scenes he came here
[01:34:21.520 --> 01:34:25.440]  years ago to want to come see me and i've had dinner with him a few times and some other things
[01:34:25.440 --> 01:34:32.640]  just like really smart and there's like a closeted alex jones okay and now you're seeing on on fox
[01:34:32.640 --> 01:34:42.080]  news but it's like a smarter closeted alex jones coming out now uh as a new world order patriot
[01:34:42.080 --> 01:34:47.840]  now that it's safer to do and he just annihilates these guests i don't have time obviously to play
[01:34:47.840 --> 01:34:53.120]  the whole thing plus it's it's not my show i haven't played you know cobear attacking me for 15 minutes
[01:34:53.120 --> 01:34:59.440]  two days ago was just lies and twisted garbage but i've got to play this because i i mean when i
[01:34:59.440 --> 01:35:03.600]  grow up i want to be like tucker carlson to be able to sit here and put up these people's crap and
[01:35:03.600 --> 01:35:09.520]  then calmly just tear him apart he sits there for 10 minutes with this congressman who keeps saying
[01:35:09.520 --> 01:35:14.240]  all the alt-rights run by russians and finally the congressman gets mad and says you work for the
[01:35:14.240 --> 01:35:21.280]  russians and folks to say that i work or tucker carlson works for the russians is just it's kind
[01:35:21.280 --> 01:35:25.760]  of a bummer because i want to go see russia someday i've been to europe a lot and things and
[01:35:25.760 --> 01:35:29.840]  been to latin america i've never been to africa i want to go there if i go to africa doesn't mean
[01:35:29.840 --> 01:35:35.280]  i'm a you know say a south african agent or i go to nigeria i'm not a nigerian agent or i got a
[01:35:35.280 --> 01:35:40.720]  tripple i'm not a you know a north african agent or a qaddafi agent but i want to go to russia
[01:35:40.720 --> 01:35:44.800]  but i'm kind of like i better not they'll say he went to russia to get his communist marching
[01:35:44.800 --> 01:35:48.880]  orders you know even though communism has been dead there for a long time seems like communism
[01:35:48.880 --> 01:35:55.440]  is coming back here so that's coming up uh here in just a moment briefly briefly there's a lot of
[01:35:55.440 --> 01:36:00.960]  new items at infowarstore.com a lot of new things we've had a lot of survival items a lot of new

[01:36:10.720 --> 01:36:14.800]  the lowest prices out there some of these we can say today are the lowest price but amazon might
[01:36:14.800 --> 01:36:18.960]  have it for less tomorrow they just undercut everybody the point is buy it from us it funds
[01:36:18.960 --> 01:36:23.920]  our operation they're great products we've checked out seeing the great products dna force is our
[01:36:23.920 --> 01:36:32.640]  flagship absolute detoxifier antioxidant you name it with the bio pqq the coq 10 and all the other

[01:36:37.920 --> 01:36:47.680]  percent off that is about to end infowarstore.com or call toll free 888-253-3139 and again there are
[01:36:47.680 --> 01:36:51.280]  a lot of specials running now i'm not going to go into all of them because of the interest of time
[01:36:51.280 --> 01:36:54.960]  but as we go towards the end of the year it's like it's the best time to buy a car is when
[01:36:56.000 --> 01:37:01.280]  end of the year it's true black friday is not a good day to shop now we have black friday specials
[01:37:01.280 --> 01:37:06.960]  that were some of the best of the year but they've got big studies how on average on average black
[01:37:06.960 --> 01:37:12.880]  friday is not one of the better days after the new year is pretty good but generally it's after
[01:37:12.880 --> 01:37:18.480]  christmas well we have prices that are after christmas now some of the biggest discounts of the
[01:37:18.480 --> 01:37:22.800]  year because like a car dealership we don't want to pay for the big inventory that's over there
[01:37:22.800 --> 01:37:26.720]  and there's some big inventory now this went faster than i thought so it's going to sell out
[01:37:26.720 --> 01:37:33.040]  before the end of the year dna force we hardly ever have it at 25 off it's amazing try it for
[01:37:33.040 --> 01:37:41.200]  yourself it regrows nerves it has nerve growth factor i cut my finger off i don't know 13 years
[01:37:41.200 --> 01:37:45.600]  ago helping people when their boat was on fire i'm not kidding kevin boost told the story he was
[01:37:45.600 --> 01:37:49.760]  there he's like let's wait for the fire department don't help him and i was like i'm gonna help him
[01:37:49.760 --> 01:37:55.600]  then i cut my finger off trying to climb from the boat fell off caught it was hanging by a piece of
[01:37:55.600 --> 01:38:00.720]  skin or would have gone to the water swam back over to my boat got back on went to the hospital
[01:38:00.720 --> 01:38:06.880]  i reattached it it was still numb on the tip and on the side and i started taking bio pqq that's in
[01:38:06.880 --> 01:38:13.680]  the dna force about three years ago when it came out and started tingling again and then all the
[01:38:13.680 --> 01:38:16.960]  feeling came back now it doesn't do that for everybody but let me warn you consult your
[01:38:16.960 --> 01:38:21.600]  physician you got back pain and stuff already or you already had injuries and old stuff sometimes
[01:38:21.600 --> 01:38:26.800]  it hurts like hell people start calling on you know my back's numb or if feelings coming back or
[01:38:26.800 --> 01:38:32.160]  whoa you know i had back surgery 10 years ago and it's like back now i've got more energy and i can
[01:38:32.160 --> 01:38:37.360]  move better but what's going on it it's it's it's one of the few products we sell it's one of the
[01:38:37.360 --> 01:38:42.640]  few nutraceuticals you can actually make claims on because it's so documented bio pqq folks we'll
[01:38:42.640 --> 01:38:46.800]  take you to the moon without a rocket of course i don't mean that literally it's amazing info wars
[01:38:46.800 --> 01:38:52.080]  live.com or call toll free 888-253-3139 now
[01:38:55.440 --> 01:39:03.520]  i cannot believe that as i sit here speaking to everyone and and talking to everybody that
[01:39:03.520 --> 01:39:07.680]  we're at the center of this and quite frankly i'm enjoying the fact that we're hurting them
[01:39:07.680 --> 01:39:15.360]  but as a person it's not fun these are very serious players we're up against and and and i laugh about
[01:39:15.360 --> 01:39:21.200]  it to put a gallows humor face on it uh it's weird to have the EU list you by name and have
[01:39:21.200 --> 01:39:26.240]  hillary and and and obama do it and to have them say we need congress to finish passing a law that
[01:39:26.240 --> 01:39:33.360]  pass the house is now in the senate uh to basically ban alt-right news websites and hate to use the
[01:39:33.360 --> 01:39:37.760]  term that they defy and they coin but the media takes it the corporate media the state run media
[01:39:37.760 --> 01:39:44.880]  puts it out and then everyone that disagrees with the establishment who are mainly classic liberals
[01:39:44.880 --> 01:39:50.320]  i mean i'd call max keiser or uh mr corolla i mean they can define themselves as classical liberals
[01:39:50.880 --> 01:39:54.960]  who who don't like the mainline republicans or democrats well we don't deserve that was a big
[01:39:54.960 --> 01:40:00.640]  enemy of bush as everybody knows to be demonized and i mean they had the npr and and new york
[01:40:00.640 --> 01:40:06.560]  times this week say alex jones is the gateway to white supremacism with no evidence no proof no
[01:40:06.560 --> 01:40:12.240]  nothing it's just he just credits the government and all the lies so then he sends you to white
[01:40:12.240 --> 01:40:18.320]  supremacist the white supremacists hate me because i'm unifying people they want the whole
[01:40:18.320 --> 01:40:23.520]  anti-neural order movement to be racist they hate my guts more than benjamin yet and yahoo
[01:40:23.520 --> 01:40:31.440]  literally because i'm unifying people i'm about ideology if there was some new country freer
[01:40:31.440 --> 01:40:37.200]  than america i'd go there i love america but this place is falling apart now that trump's here i'm
[01:40:37.200 --> 01:40:41.360]  gonna you know obviously stay and i'm pleased to go down with the ship but i was thinking i might have
[01:40:41.360 --> 01:40:45.680]  to go down with it now we've got a chance not because he's perfect but but because he's aware
[01:40:45.680 --> 01:40:50.320]  of what's happening and he's not out to get people so we're being censored on reddit we're being
[01:40:50.320 --> 01:40:54.720]  censored on facebook now i guess taking our site down's the next thing they're basically
[01:40:54.720 --> 01:40:59.760]  blocking people being able to share our information this is a war let's counter them by sending out

[01:41:05.760 --> 01:41:11.360]  physically at trump tower we're also going to deliver it to congress but make a big deal
[01:41:11.360 --> 01:41:15.200]  out of hundreds of thousands of signatures saying we don't want our first amendment band
[01:41:15.200 --> 01:41:21.040]  that's up on info wars dot com and you know i said let's just extend it 10 hours but let's extend

[01:41:59.280 --> 01:42:04.240]  but there's a video up on info wars dot com that is the video of the day congressman calls tucker
[01:42:04.240 --> 01:42:12.400]  carlson a russian agent on prime time television and it's a long 10 minute clip and and i wish
[01:42:12.400 --> 01:42:16.560]  carlson would have brought this up i guess he didn't know about it but the same day
[01:42:17.360 --> 01:42:21.280]  they're on at night seven o'clock central eight o'clock eastern that morning the washington
[01:42:21.280 --> 01:42:34.720]  post came out retracted a november 14th piece from three weeks ago where they say that basically info
[01:42:34.720 --> 01:42:40.000]  wars and and were listed bright bart drugs that were russian agents and that we know that russian
[01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:43.120]  bots were helping us look through this they have bots trying to block us it's the opposite
[01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:48.880]  and then they had to come out and say okay there's no russian bots we're being sued and uh we made
[01:42:48.880 --> 01:42:54.240]  up and we're sorry and uh by the way we shouldn't say these things are all fake news yeah you got
[01:42:54.240 --> 01:42:58.560]  to sue somebody you got to prove it was a lie then when somebody's lost a bunch of lawsuits
[01:42:58.560 --> 01:43:04.880]  you can say that's a quack site another trick they've got is there are real fake news sites
[01:43:04.880 --> 01:43:09.440]  that put out fake news stories all the time and and they they they're covered under the first
[01:43:09.440 --> 01:43:14.480]  amendment they're covered under satire but they're not really operating a satire a new yorker magazine
[01:43:14.480 --> 01:43:19.600]  does this more and more like a third of their writing is satire they won't tell you at satire
[01:43:19.600 --> 01:43:24.480]  so more and more mainstream news has been argued in federal court as well and they get sued that
[01:43:24.480 --> 01:43:29.360]  they're entertainment and they're allowed to put out fake news that's the new thinking on jessey
[01:43:29.360 --> 01:43:32.560]  ventura's tv show they were like we've got to say we're entertainment because if we get something
[01:43:32.560 --> 01:43:37.040]  wrong it's okay if it's entertainment that's what the lawyers are saying and i didn't get that thinking
[01:43:37.040 --> 01:43:41.120]  i thought you're covered under the first amendment news gathering even more but that's where the laws
[01:43:41.120 --> 01:43:46.880]  going now and rulings that mainstream can be fake tell an nfl ticket says it's not real and is
[01:43:46.880 --> 01:43:52.640]  entertainment now i think most of it's real there's some fake plays some people take a dive there's
[01:43:52.640 --> 01:43:57.200]  but but just in case they're just telling you this is theater this isn't real how much they
[01:43:57.200 --> 01:44:03.120]  tried to say with the whole primary situation so this is just an intriguing intriguing clip
[01:44:05.040 --> 01:44:09.520]  and again watch the whole thing and info wars calm i'd love to play the whole thing but the
[01:44:09.520 --> 01:44:14.080]  time we have we're going to go to this club and come back and take your calls on fake news i mean
[01:44:14.080 --> 01:44:18.720]  this is their move against free speech worldwide the chinese started banning free speech online
[01:44:18.720 --> 01:44:23.600]  when chinese started going online 20 years ago you'd see it you know this guy was arrested for
[01:44:23.600 --> 01:44:28.800]  writing fake news on a message board he's in a labor camp for three years this guy repeatedly
[01:44:28.800 --> 01:44:36.960]  did it he's being executed for fake news that is a communist chinese term and there it was hiding
[01:44:36.960 --> 01:44:42.480]  in plain view all the years i said the prostitutes the deception media the collaborator media the
[01:44:42.480 --> 01:44:48.320]  corporate media the discredited media the lamestream media the dinosaur media is a term i coined
[01:44:50.560 --> 01:44:56.080]  prostitutes a gerald salente and then it hit me like a ton of bricks
[01:44:58.160 --> 01:45:02.960]  it's the name they put on us everything's inverted i haven't given you any fake news today

[01:54:09.920 --> 01:54:14.240]  just ten billion dollars in steel jobs he's not even in the office yet announcing they're coming
[01:54:14.240 --> 01:54:18.720]  back 50 billion japanese high-tech investment carrier coming back two forward plans coming back

[01:54:31.920 --> 01:54:38.160]  carbon dioxide is not a pollutant it makes plants grow it's not associated with temperature
[01:54:38.160 --> 01:54:44.480]  increase it comes after temperature increase because of a blooming of plants and we are in
[01:54:44.480 --> 01:54:52.000]  oxygen and carbon dioxide starved period like mars lost its atmosphere it had water and
[01:54:52.000 --> 01:54:57.120]  had oxygen it had everything it still does but just not at a livable level for our species
[01:54:58.160 --> 01:55:02.560]  they've proven it with the probes in fact they believe there was life on mars before us because
[01:55:02.560 --> 01:55:07.920]  it cooled off first and whether you believe that or not the point is scientists admit we're losing
[01:55:07.920 --> 01:55:15.920]  our atmosphere the earth has lower oxygen and carbon dioxide carbon oxide is is is hundreds
[01:55:15.920 --> 01:55:22.560]  of times lower than it used to be back during say the Jurassic i mean it's crazy how close this
[01:55:22.560 --> 01:55:27.520]  planet is losing its atmosphere you want to really have some fear mongering now in the scheme of
[01:55:27.520 --> 01:55:33.120]  things millions of years maybe hundreds of thousands i don't know i think big asteroid
[01:55:33.120 --> 01:55:37.440]  impacts too once your atmosphere gets weak can then basically expel your atmosphere out into space
[01:55:37.440 --> 01:55:44.080]  but that all gets into astrophysics and terra farming and nasa research and it's all debatable
[01:55:47.280 --> 01:55:53.600]  what's not debatable is that we're being brainwashed now i have another clip i want to play
[01:55:54.880 --> 01:55:57.920]  i already mentioned this but i want to play it one more time
[01:55:57.920 --> 01:56:01.120]  um
[01:56:04.320 --> 01:56:09.120]  when i'm having a coffin fit it's always good to have a drink of water isn't it
[01:56:09.120 --> 01:56:12.320]  or to have them throw something up over on the screen that's always good too
[01:56:15.760 --> 01:56:20.720]  let me go to the next story i was going to mention it's up on info wars dot com video
[01:56:20.720 --> 01:56:28.960]  sheriff blast lefty lawyer hands up don't shoot was fake news there are dead cops
[01:56:30.320 --> 01:56:37.120]  because of that fake news story yeah remember remember what we were told in Ferguson Missouri
[01:56:38.880 --> 01:56:44.480]  they had eight different black witnesses say that there was no hands up don't shoot
[01:56:45.200 --> 01:56:49.600]  that the man who'd been arrested convicted many times of shaking people down and
[01:56:49.600 --> 01:56:53.360]  breaking into things had just been robbing the local convenience store of goods
[01:56:54.560 --> 01:57:00.160]  it was in some type of probably drug induced rage we don't know and charged the police car
[01:57:01.280 --> 01:57:05.520]  and then got shot but hey george soros put out the whole thing hands up don't shoot and in the
[01:57:05.520 --> 01:57:10.240]  nfl folks making tens of millions of dollars a year could put their hands up and all feel bad
[01:57:10.240 --> 01:57:16.480]  about themselves and uh you know uh you know go out and demonize everybody like they'd been
[01:57:16.480 --> 01:57:25.200]  put under attack it was the new york times msnbc washington post cnn all promulgated and here's
[01:57:25.200 --> 01:57:31.680]  the big point i wanted to make that i thought i'm during the break mainstream corporate dinosaur
[01:57:31.680 --> 01:57:41.600]  fake news has really jumped the 10 trillion pound mutated five-eyed shark the super megalodon
[01:57:41.600 --> 01:57:50.880]  when they came out and declared everyone that disagreed with them fake news this is like 20
[01:57:50.880 --> 01:57:54.320]  times bigger than coming out and saying trump supporters are deplorable
[01:57:56.880 --> 01:58:01.280]  because they're just announcing everything but us everything but the establishment
[01:58:01.280 --> 01:58:07.360]  isn't even real not on some case by case basis just you're not real we have secret list and let's

[01:58:16.800 --> 01:58:24.160]  alternative documents raw videos photos so what are they gonna do there just block his url so
[01:58:24.160 --> 01:58:29.120]  people can't even share that it's all verbal it's all mental it's all done by osmosis person to person
[01:58:29.120 --> 01:58:34.160]  info wars is two and that's why we've got to do that now more than ever because they're

[02:01:04.320 --> 02:01:09.840]  programmers above me and that's the joke that tucker carlson was just making earlier that is
[02:01:09.840 --> 02:01:14.800]  there's some you know centralized putin calling him to give him orders because he had a congressman
[02:01:14.800 --> 02:01:24.080]  on a democratic congressman on saying to his face you're a russian agent and then they have no evidence
[02:01:24.080 --> 02:01:29.360]  that russia is controlling the alt right as hillary defines us and even the washington post had to
[02:01:29.360 --> 02:01:36.720]  retract that yesterday because it's outrageous libel it's outrageous slander it's outrageous defamation
[02:01:37.920 --> 02:01:40.640]  so james and steven and brian and david and hector
[02:01:41.440 --> 02:01:44.800]  hector's been holding the longest so i'm going to james and others steven away
[02:01:44.800 --> 02:01:52.080]  we're going to go to you pretty early on to bring in wildcard points and stuff with our guest adam
[02:01:52.080 --> 02:01:58.640]  curry and of course uh max keiser now i'll just call him max flamingo well why not just get the name
[02:01:58.640 --> 02:02:02.640]  completely wrong after we were obsessing on the fact that the pope's gonna star in the new
[02:02:02.640 --> 02:02:10.000]  pink flamingos movie uh we discussed that that satire folks because the pope made horribly disgusting
[02:02:10.000 --> 02:02:15.040]  statements yesterday that i won't even repeat on air and dignify about the type of stuff that goes
[02:02:15.040 --> 02:02:21.040]  through his his mind i won't sit here and talk about how he talked about how people enjoy eating
[02:02:21.040 --> 02:02:29.120]  feces and having sexual pleasure from it as i just did that's a greek form of uh arguing there that
[02:02:29.120 --> 02:02:33.120]  we just engaged in uh we're going to go to your phone calls after the break since i mentioned it
[02:02:33.120 --> 02:02:38.000]  here is mr fake news brian williams and it's so surreal to have hillary to play the clip last
[02:02:38.000 --> 02:02:44.080]  hour saying we need congress to pass the law to shut down the fake news we'll decide what it is
[02:02:44.080 --> 02:02:50.240]  it's very dangerous this is the biggest liar of our lifetimes who said she was in combat attacked
[02:02:50.240 --> 02:02:55.600]  well like brian williams running around lying to us but here's williams with this other weasel
[02:02:56.400 --> 02:03:00.400]  and then they go out to real fake news sites and then come and interview them

[02:10:00.960 --> 02:10:05.360]  produce human milk but this is now coming out in mainstream news you've been saying this for years

[02:10:21.200 --> 02:10:26.560]  you know it's not like i'm saying automobiles are coming in like 1800 but nothing about me

[02:11:04.960 --> 02:11:08.720]  are there any teleprompters here because they now accuse me of claiming that there's teleprompters in
[02:11:08.720 --> 02:11:13.680]  here i don't see any teleprompter no there are a call list over there yeah that's the call list

[02:11:18.640 --> 02:11:22.000]  take calls to go maybe 20 minutes to the next hour fantastic all right and then i'll and then i'm
[02:11:22.000 --> 02:11:26.560]  going to hand them a ton to leon macadoo to take over uh for the rest of that and also play a clip
[02:11:26.560 --> 02:11:30.560]  from our um great reporter uh whose job they're exposing a lot of stuff that's happening on the
[02:11:30.560 --> 02:11:35.440]  road to the trump events now instead of me talking and first asking my questions what is front and
[02:11:35.440 --> 02:11:41.840]  sit him uh front and center on your radar screen fake news fake news is number one which um as you
[02:11:41.840 --> 02:11:46.560]  know the no agenda show is the podcast that i do um we've been tracking this for a long time
[02:11:46.560 --> 02:11:51.520]  and we feel that this is now the opportune moment especially connection with pizza gate which is
[02:11:51.520 --> 02:11:57.600]  being used as you know oh it's dangerous so licensing is on its way licensing of journalists
[02:11:57.600 --> 02:12:01.200]  licensing of all kinds of things that's what i that's what we really believe is going to happen
[02:12:01.200 --> 02:12:06.160]  and then you're the accepted group because you tell the line yeah oh yeah that's how china does it
[02:12:06.160 --> 02:12:10.800]  they license journalists and even when they get out of line they arrest you for fake news max and i
[02:12:10.800 --> 02:12:15.120]  were talking the other day neither of us are verified on twitter and i think that's where it's
[02:12:15.120 --> 02:12:19.680]  really going to start he has 25 million viewers a week conservatively one of the biggest networks
[02:12:19.680 --> 02:12:24.560]  in the world not verified the invented virtual trading on the stock market yeah buddies with
[02:12:24.560 --> 02:12:30.560]  george soros bitcoin meister doesn't get any credit about the real situation real the real
[02:12:30.560 --> 02:12:34.800]  guy is here that's right unverified but it gives me plausible deniability because this way i can
[02:12:34.800 --> 02:12:38.800]  say it's not really me tweeting tilt the mic towards your face but i think that that is the
[02:12:38.800 --> 02:12:42.880]  first step is this verification thing you know because you look at this journalist who have
[02:12:42.880 --> 02:12:48.160]  500 followers and they work some station somewhere and they get verified uh i think i'm the real
[02:12:48.160 --> 02:12:52.640]  adam curry i'm pretty sure i am but i now i don't want it because that will be in the market well
[02:12:52.640 --> 02:12:56.400]  back in the day i was dumb and never really got on twitter early but then i had to really have people
[02:12:56.400 --> 02:13:00.400]  call them and get mad even have a lawyer write a letter and they go okay fine give us a copier
[02:13:00.400 --> 02:13:04.960]  passport your driver's license and some type of bill then we'll see and then and then they finally
[02:13:04.960 --> 02:13:09.440]  did it yeah so but now i'm told people that are even more famous than i am or you and
[02:13:09.440 --> 02:13:13.840]  they just won't even respond to you when you want to get verified yeah but i i don't want it now
[02:13:13.840 --> 02:13:19.280]  now i'm not interested yeah we'll continue that's a big big truth bomb i hadn't thought of that right
[02:13:19.280 --> 02:13:24.240]  they are going to push licensing well of course they are i mean this is how in europe the european
[02:13:24.240 --> 02:13:31.040]  parliament just passed a resolution and uh this is all about fake news and the whole idea is to fund
[02:13:31.040 --> 02:13:36.880]  journalists a journalist with education fund angio angios to really work and to create lists
[02:13:36.880 --> 02:13:40.880]  to block off our sites it's already happening to us of course it is by the way let's say it
[02:13:40.880 --> 02:13:45.680]  that's what matt drudge came here a year ago and said that's what he always hypes on he said stop
[02:13:45.680 --> 02:13:49.600]  being on facebook and twitter they're going to end up censoring you build your own
[02:13:49.600 --> 02:13:55.200]  platform everybody go to websites again have lots of independent things like lots of little
[02:13:55.200 --> 02:14:00.240]  independent shops and restaurants it's the same thing not big box stores you know go to no agenda
[02:14:00.240 --> 02:14:06.400]  show dot com go to curry dot com i built a platform called start join it's a crowdfunding
[02:14:06.400 --> 02:14:13.040]  platform with its own cryptocurrency called start coin so to to your point alex building a platform
[02:14:13.040 --> 02:14:18.240]  with its own currency to fight the new world order that's what i'm doing that's how i'm contributing
[02:14:18.240 --> 02:14:24.880]  to this revolution good i mean what more can i say about it now there is a drudge says their
[02:14:24.880 --> 02:14:29.200]  internet ghettos and that was over a year ago in the studio it really is internet ghettos now
[02:14:29.200 --> 02:14:32.960]  that's related with the jews first they first said okay you can't advertise you can't have your
[02:14:32.960 --> 02:14:37.760]  businesses in this area then now you got to be in this ghetto now watch this poor dirty people
[02:14:37.760 --> 02:14:42.080]  let's take them and send them to a work camp but it's undeniable and they kill you it's undeniable
[02:14:42.080 --> 02:14:47.280]  now we see the president of elect trump we see what happened with brexit we see what's happened
[02:14:47.280 --> 02:14:53.600]  with italy i think these types of platforms alternative to the mainstream is more important
[02:14:53.600 --> 02:14:58.720]  than ever right now and people are definitely finding it the facebook is kind of becoming a
[02:14:58.720 --> 02:15:03.040]  graveyard in a way i mean i have to have an account just to see what's going on but i really
[02:15:03.040 --> 02:15:08.640]  it's none of its well i famously said i use it like a toilet i mean i don't expect it to always be
[02:15:08.640 --> 02:15:13.360]  there uh and it's just kind of like a hole in the ground out back you know at the farmhouse
[02:15:13.360 --> 02:15:18.240]  but we put our info out there but we don't expect it to be there tomorrow it may very well not be
[02:15:18.240 --> 02:15:22.960]  i mean online communities always end up broken they always i mean we've seen it geocities aol
[02:15:22.960 --> 02:15:27.680]  eventually it'll go away um they've captured a critical mass and there's something like two
[02:15:27.680 --> 02:15:34.480]  billion monthly users and it's going to they're rolling out aircraft to hover over places without
[02:15:34.480 --> 02:15:39.760]  internet connectivity to create more users so clearly this is an incredible force to be reckoned with
[02:15:39.760 --> 02:15:46.240]  and as we're leading up to the election you know the mark zuckerberg the ceo and his connections
[02:15:46.240 --> 02:15:50.800]  in washington were helping to filter news oh he was already censoring massively and then after
[02:15:50.800 --> 02:15:55.600]  hillary lost the media said the the dinosaur media it's your fault you didn't censor more and so
[02:15:55.600 --> 02:16:00.720]  now he's doing it right well this is this is the the epic battle that's taking place is mainstream
[02:16:00.720 --> 02:16:06.960]  media who just like the record business for years deny deny deny and you know if you saw 2000 records
[02:16:06.960 --> 02:16:12.560]  your top 10 on billboard just that's how bad it is well it's really it's that bad too well i could
[02:16:12.560 --> 02:16:17.760]  put out an album and sell 100s albums you get platinum status but yeah i'll show us christmas
[02:16:17.760 --> 02:16:22.880]  record i would i would definitely buy that the jiggle bell's the lonely soldier uh mama stole
[02:16:22.880 --> 02:16:30.320]  my christmas tree all the classics i want to do it let's do it why i'm all got run over by a reindeer
[02:16:30.320 --> 02:16:33.760]  that's it that's it that's that's that's i'm interrupting this guy's saying smart stuff
[02:16:33.760 --> 02:16:38.160]  of course he is i forgot what i was talking about adam curry no no you were saying the music industry
[02:16:38.160 --> 02:16:43.440]  didn't listen they were arrogant they didn't get it so now news and news the they fought they fought
[02:16:43.440 --> 02:16:48.880]  they fought google was complicit by killing google reader which rss which is still a great
[02:16:48.880 --> 02:16:54.320]  distribution mechanism gives you in fact a feed very much like a twitter or facebook feed when
[02:16:54.320 --> 02:17:00.720]  google reader was purposely destroyed the whole idea of rss kind of fell apart but it's slowly
[02:17:00.720 --> 02:17:07.120]  coming back now and you see the epic battle between the mainstream against silicon valley all day now
[02:17:07.120 --> 02:17:12.160]  i hear on on mainstream is well you know these guys are dangerous now and so this is going to be an
[02:17:12.160 --> 02:17:16.240]  interesting budding of heads we'll see what happens there i tell what's exciting i actually have a
[02:17:16.240 --> 02:17:22.800]  fellow showing up about 215 today when we go off air and and and the ladies take over who is the
[02:17:22.800 --> 02:17:28.480]  owner of one of the larger second tier about to become first tier cord cutting companies
[02:17:29.200 --> 02:17:33.120]  and he gets what's happening it's all about content content content like redstone said
[02:17:33.120 --> 02:17:39.360]  back in the 30s when he went from just it being about the theaters uh to the actual content before
[02:17:39.360 --> 02:17:43.200]  it was just the theater movies were like some secondary deal you just went to the big fancy
[02:17:43.200 --> 02:17:48.640]  theater and drinks or whatever and so i see there's all sorts of other things they're going to bite
[02:17:48.640 --> 02:17:52.560]  the mainstream dinosaur media in the butt we're the least of their problems it's going to be all
[02:17:52.560 --> 02:17:57.600]  these other distribution platforms yes and uh not only that but different business models you have
[02:17:58.160 --> 02:18:04.720]  phenomenally interesting and i think obviously successful business model um with your entire
[02:18:04.720 --> 02:18:08.560]  info wars life and all your all the pride i mean hey that's how i got turned on you i got
[02:18:08.560 --> 02:18:14.080]  burkey water filter i got my one acre crisis seed garden thank you meals ready to eat um
[02:18:15.280 --> 02:18:20.960]  super female vitality no when i take yeah by the way it actually works better for men for
[02:18:20.960 --> 02:18:25.520]  whatever reason but men don't want to buy that formula potty squatty is a innovative product
[02:18:25.520 --> 02:18:29.920]  that changes people's lives you know everyone needs a max quality let's be serious gardening
[02:18:29.920 --> 02:18:34.560]  and we sell really cool products starting again with a marijuana version we sell really good
[02:18:34.560 --> 02:18:38.880]  products and fund ourselves yeah that's an original idea and more and more people are going to adopt
[02:18:38.880 --> 02:18:42.160]  that where you sell direct products to your audience and don't have to have some corporate
[02:18:42.160 --> 02:18:47.280]  sponsor and we get a drone delivery service you know get the drones on the roof so people
[02:18:47.280 --> 02:18:53.280]  go as you were continuing so where do you see this adam curry where do you see this going well uh so
[02:18:53.280 --> 02:18:57.680]  obviously we have our own distribution um it may get a little complicated you know they may start
[02:18:57.680 --> 02:19:01.520]  to shut things down but i think it is look at how wiki leaks everyone got around it you know
[02:19:01.520 --> 02:19:05.040]  that's kind of unstoppable the internet in that regard i think is still pretty sure that's where
[02:19:05.040 --> 02:19:09.120]  they're starting it's just stealth banning oh sorry you can't share info or links as of yesterday
[02:19:09.120 --> 02:19:14.720]  on face well on reddit facebook it's selective only some of our links it's on reddit it's just
[02:19:14.720 --> 02:19:21.920]  yeah you can't right so but you have a million votes it won't go up that's right um but that's why
[02:19:21.920 --> 02:19:27.520]  advertising online i don't see a future in that uh and the mainstream has an even npr other like
[02:19:27.520 --> 02:19:32.800]  pbs public media have no idea how to actually work with the public to create programming and

[02:24:39.120 --> 02:24:48.480]  of the the group um the um what what what group was that guns and roses uh stacey herbert does an
[02:24:48.480 --> 02:24:53.600]  excellent axl rose impression just want to put that out there you're always being ironic on my
[02:24:53.600 --> 02:25:00.720]  show and not yours can we have the serious max uh it's i think it's it obviously the topic du jour
[02:25:00.720 --> 02:25:06.640]  is the this idea fake news as adam mentioned it it's total censorship and how they're dressing up
[02:25:06.640 --> 02:25:13.200]  their most draconian book burning attack on free speech the world's ever seen it just the bravada
[02:25:13.200 --> 02:25:18.080]  of it yeah i mean so but darry under mccarthyism there there was something called the communists
[02:25:18.080 --> 02:25:22.480]  and you had the you know the committee to save america from the communists now it's the evil
[02:25:22.480 --> 02:25:26.800]  patriots that want to make america great again we got to shut them up because they're russian agents
[02:25:26.800 --> 02:25:34.240]  who the hell believes that but fake news is is oxymoronic and that news is by definition extemporaneous
[02:25:34.240 --> 02:25:38.240]  and open to revision that's that they say it's the first draft of history so a lot of what's
[02:25:38.240 --> 02:25:43.200]  reported as news later it's like well you know at the in the heat of the battle we we looked at it
[02:25:43.200 --> 02:25:47.760]  after six months and we revised what was then considered news and this is more of the historical
[02:25:47.760 --> 02:25:54.240]  document so to say that's fake news is again it's an oxymoron all news to some degree would have a
[02:25:54.240 --> 02:25:58.400]  some degree of subjectivity to it would have some degree of but these are the people saying kill
[02:25:58.400 --> 02:26:04.320]  donald trump that's not pure it's not a pure it comes out all propaganda whole cloth and pure news
[02:26:04.320 --> 02:26:08.880]  has in many times many times has errors in it you try to do the best that you can but to say it's
[02:26:08.880 --> 02:26:13.120]  fake news it's the same we don't want any news we don't want any right they're introducing the idea
[02:26:13.120 --> 02:26:18.480]  that we want propaganda we want only propaganda it comes from one source and if you don't report
[02:26:18.480 --> 02:26:22.320]  what we say it's like britain where we do most of our shows is become a totalitarian
[02:26:22.880 --> 02:26:28.240]  propaganda state where the state is now dictating everything that comes out in any major
[02:26:28.240 --> 02:26:33.360]  news source we're constantly harassed as i was 20 saying yesterday for my off-com the regulator
[02:26:33.360 --> 02:26:40.160]  who gets actually into our face and says he gives us scripts the uk regulator gives us scripts to
[02:26:40.160 --> 02:26:45.840]  read on our show and then they accuse us of propaganda the regulator gives us scripts that are
[02:26:45.840 --> 02:26:52.720]  detailing our position on energy companies in the uk that's state sponsored propaganda that's
[02:26:52.720 --> 02:26:57.360]  right up there a pull pot and all of this grew out of the notices all this grew out of national
[02:26:57.360 --> 02:27:02.320]  security oh you can't talk about where nuclear weapons are stored next it's you can't say you're
[02:27:02.320 --> 02:27:05.680]  for brexit or you can't say you're against it you just have to have no view you can't you can't
[02:27:05.680 --> 02:27:09.360]  imagine brexit for six months you can't say anything negative about the migrant situation
[02:27:09.360 --> 02:27:14.880]  we can't say it didn't mention brexit for six months or they threaten to take rt off the air in the
[02:27:14.880 --> 02:27:20.000]  uk uh and that and that's what the regulator said okay and that's that's the kind of restrictions
[02:27:20.000 --> 02:27:24.880]  we deal with there's no free speech in the uk the uk is pretty high up on the global free speech
[02:27:24.880 --> 02:27:28.960]  and by the way they want a law passed here the same as england that quote if something's foreign
[02:27:28.960 --> 02:27:34.080]  media while they invited in then you're an american on that international platform everything's global
[02:27:34.080 --> 02:27:38.240]  then you can't ever make comments about anything domestic well how are you supposed to do the news
[02:27:38.240 --> 02:27:44.240]  then i'm sure you covered the repeal of the smith month act yes your show and people need to hear
[02:27:44.240 --> 02:27:50.080]  that i think that in the i think was the mid 70s there was a bill an act a law that said the u.s
[02:27:50.080 --> 02:27:54.880]  government may not uh propagandize its citizens they repealed it three years ago in the national
[02:27:54.880 --> 02:28:00.720]  defense authorization act and the reasoning behind it was well we do so much propaganda on the internet
[02:28:00.720 --> 02:28:04.960]  that it's going to eventually flow into the u.s so so just so we don't get in trouble you might as
[02:28:04.960 --> 02:28:09.360]  well just take it off the table and this is only a couple years they said we're going to put out fake
[02:28:09.360 --> 02:28:14.320]  news they said even deceptive stories we do put out the voice of america they do put out fake
[02:28:14.320 --> 02:28:18.480]  so they're saying we're fake when they admit they're fake and pass the law that they can lie to us
[02:28:18.480 --> 02:28:24.160]  correct voice of america is an american propaganda arm for american propaganda it's it was out you
[02:28:24.160 --> 02:28:29.360]  couldn't broadcast voice of america in america due to anti anti propaganda laws then they changed
[02:28:29.360 --> 02:28:33.920]  the law and now you can broadcast voice of america inside america because their pro propaganda there
[02:28:33.920 --> 02:28:38.720]  is no anti propaganda laws anymore in america as i mentioned to you a while ago when i was doing my
[02:28:38.720 --> 02:28:43.360]  show in paris i was approached from somebody from voice america to do an on-air hissy fit
[02:28:43.360 --> 02:28:48.560]  resignation on rt and i wait was this the same time when that other girl that girl did that came
[02:28:48.560 --> 02:28:53.440]  out a few years later it up yeah it's all set up and i told you know it's of course we know it's not
[02:28:53.440 --> 02:28:58.000]  really voice of america it's central intelligence agency right so yeah they were flashing some big
[02:28:58.000 --> 02:29:03.120]  money around they're like you don't get it i was a stockbroker in the 80s you can't bribe me you
[02:29:03.120 --> 02:29:07.360]  not when not with that sack of money you've got to come with a truck full of money or go home but he
[02:29:07.360 --> 02:29:14.080]  is bribeable you know it's a truck is big enough maybe three eighteen wheelers but it's the budget
[02:29:14.080 --> 02:29:19.040]  of voice of america does not wouldn't wouldn't take me to the place i would need to go to to

[02:33:57.760 --> 02:34:03.280]  she's not on it oh that's too bad but let's get serious here for a minute i was like okay they
[02:34:03.280 --> 02:34:08.640]  really are coming for us they admit they are i think it's a major miscalculation i'm not trying to
[02:34:08.640 --> 02:34:14.240]  be overconfident they were already planning to censor after the election hillary said the alt
[02:34:14.240 --> 02:34:18.880]  right will be discredited when they lose we have to shut them down well she wasn't even looking at
[02:34:18.880 --> 02:34:23.040]  the real polls now we're gonna have the president in there who's not perfect i'm sure but isn't
[02:34:23.040 --> 02:34:27.920]  going to be for censorship of the media that got him into power any other media i hope how do you
[02:34:27.920 --> 02:34:32.000]  see this playing out well there's something else that isn't happening and um we actually covered
[02:34:32.000 --> 02:34:40.560]  this yesterday on the show uh my partner night of john c dvorak and that is the tort laws um so now
[02:34:41.600 --> 02:34:44.720]  there's going to be you're going to see a lot of reporting about if someone
[02:34:45.280 --> 02:34:50.960]  creates fake news or propagates fake fake news what legal recourse do you have against those
[02:34:50.960 --> 02:34:56.160]  people so i think you're going to see a number of key lawsuits where someone posts something online
[02:34:56.160 --> 02:34:59.920]  and they're going to get oh i agree i think they're drumming it up and trying to maybe frame me as
[02:34:59.920 --> 02:35:04.080]  the test subject i've been picking up on that because they just keep saying things i didn't say
[02:35:04.080 --> 02:35:08.000]  well you are definitely the poster child of fake news today i mean they're putting you in everywhere
[02:35:08.000 --> 02:35:12.800]  which i think is fantastic i mean what what what an exposure i mean people are people
[02:35:12.800 --> 02:35:16.000]  let's be honest so do you think they pick me because they think i'm weak or because i'm hurting them
[02:35:16.800 --> 02:35:21.200]  i mean i mean we are growing we are hurting them uh they all miscalculated and thought
[02:35:21.200 --> 02:35:25.760]  connecting me to trump would discredit him but their own numbers show it actually i don't i think
[02:35:25.760 --> 02:35:29.760]  in general the people who produce the shows that will do that like you know it's the news networks
[02:35:29.760 --> 02:35:35.040]  you know cnn and msnbc i think it's just because you're dynamic and interesting to look at and
[02:35:35.040 --> 02:35:39.680]  if you live in a separate dimension which a lot of people do today and they have their own reality
[02:35:39.680 --> 02:35:43.440]  i think they believe things are true and i can't stop that oh that's all hillary was really going
[02:35:43.440 --> 02:35:48.800]  to win oh big time big time and they look at you and your vocal and your you know and of course
[02:35:48.800 --> 02:35:53.680]  it's always the moment where you're kind of energized that they put in there and that everyone
[02:35:53.680 --> 02:35:58.080]  is oh my god look at these people that's just a visual thing i don't think they're really thinking
[02:35:58.080 --> 02:36:03.040]  about and i agree i i think it's a disconnect too because it's not that we think trump's perfect
[02:36:03.600 --> 02:36:09.520]  it's it's that hillary's a real warmonger the the just like we rejected jeb bush everybody and then
[02:36:09.520 --> 02:36:14.240]  she stole the nomination from bernie sanders i think sanders might have beaten trump very possibly
[02:36:14.240 --> 02:36:19.440]  and joe biden might have beaten trump yeah i mean you know i'm very possible very possible because
[02:36:19.440 --> 02:36:26.960]  he's got that whole blue collar appeal he's had everyone loves joe yeah yeah i knew hillary was
[02:36:26.960 --> 02:36:32.240]  gonna lose about a month before the election when joe was giving speeches biden and having to go look
[02:36:32.240 --> 02:36:37.520]  i know a lot of you don't like her and i don't blame me okay but i mean everybody's like yeah
[02:36:37.520 --> 02:36:43.040]  the crowd's like yeah we don't like and he's like whoa man i think it was just one hillary stumbled
[02:36:43.040 --> 02:36:47.200]  away from parachuting biden into the race all she had to do is just stumble one more time
[02:36:47.200 --> 02:36:50.800]  and she would have been carried out i think he was on deck i think he was on deck for i think so
[02:36:50.800 --> 02:36:54.960]  i think he's on deck he kind of stumbled away into the finish line and then but again max the
[02:36:54.960 --> 02:37:00.640]  arrogance of running someone who was in the hospital for over a year in 2012-2013 we have the
[02:37:00.640 --> 02:37:04.160]  sources they didn't want to say definitively because it gets into records issues and things but
[02:37:04.160 --> 02:37:09.120]  she had a brain tumor removed i have this from really high level people yeah and then the sucker
[02:37:09.120 --> 02:37:14.320]  reportedly is growing back word is she ain't wrong laparoscopic surgery removed the brain
[02:37:14.320 --> 02:37:20.640]  tumor from with from the passing the instruments through the anus up through the elementary canal
[02:37:20.640 --> 02:37:25.280]  into the back of the head are you and they captured the tumor it's actually out back through
[02:37:25.280 --> 02:37:30.800]  the the anus and it's not well reported but you know getting back to the legal aspect of things
[02:37:30.800 --> 02:37:35.200]  you know where they are that was fake news that was pretty that was really satire that's that's
[02:37:35.200 --> 02:37:40.320]  higher hey i spent a month before the secret service told us she's falling down she has a
[02:37:40.320 --> 02:37:44.240]  black ambulance and then you everybody saw it happen i really got there from a secret service
[02:37:44.240 --> 02:37:48.240]  this is by the way was shaking when i saw them in clevis we're going to give the next few weeks
[02:37:48.240 --> 02:37:53.600]  and then these are secrets and then we got the info these guys are shaking because they're so
[02:37:53.600 --> 02:37:57.440]  conditioned not to tell the stuff well how does that's real news brother it's called bear
[02:37:57.440 --> 02:38:03.680]  criticize fake news when he made his bones as a satirist which is like he plays a fake right
[02:38:03.680 --> 02:38:07.840]  winger right he is a fake news person but now he's coming out against so-called fake news
[02:38:07.840 --> 02:38:13.040]  ryan williams why are they using brian williams the poster the king of fake news as the new crusader
[02:38:13.040 --> 02:38:18.480]  against well i know brian williams i've known him for a while um and he when i was in new york
[02:38:18.480 --> 02:38:23.680]  living in new york new jersey he would do human interest pieces for the local mbc station on
[02:38:23.680 --> 02:38:28.640]  like breast augmentation this guy is just a total robot he'll do whatever you tell him to do he really
[02:38:28.640 --> 02:38:33.040]  he's not a journalist as far as i'm concerned he's a hack yeah he's just a dude he looks apart
[02:38:33.040 --> 02:38:38.320]  yeah he looks the broadcast news yes you know it's a great movie about this he looks like a serial
[02:38:38.320 --> 02:38:44.240]  killer but it looks like a guy who does the news on tv he fills the role couldn't he star in the new
[02:38:44.240 --> 02:38:49.520]  american psycho easily easily that hammer guy on fox i mean i'm not saying femur's bad but
[02:38:49.520 --> 02:38:54.080]  he looks scarier than christian veil did i agree with you that guy looks very scary i wouldn't
[02:38:54.080 --> 02:38:58.560]  want to meet him in a dark alley but back to clinton i think what is happening um i don't
[02:38:58.560 --> 02:39:03.120]  have you have you ever had charles or telon um no but i've heard of him yeah so he's the guy who
[02:39:03.120 --> 02:39:07.920]  he's a financial analyst uh and he really took apart the clinton foundation and there yeah let's
[02:39:07.920 --> 02:39:14.240]  get charles or telon you definitely need to get this guy on there is so much fraud and abuse that
[02:39:14.240 --> 02:39:18.960]  he has identified and of course he's not getting on the air anywhere now and if i think that just
[02:39:18.960 --> 02:39:25.680]  the the tentacles of that organization were so spread out throughout the political system
[02:39:25.680 --> 02:39:30.640]  and other large circles that everyone's deathly afraid they were afraid to do anything against
[02:39:30.640 --> 02:39:35.200]  the clintons i really think sure i mean i mean at the top they're all scared mercenaries but what
[02:39:35.200 --> 02:39:38.640]  about the minions that did you see the video of her give the speech or stay saying we let out the
[02:39:38.640 --> 02:39:43.920]  government says people then her own minions were like squealing like like like like their mommy had
[02:39:43.920 --> 02:39:49.760]  just been killed yeah well these people have been terrorized are very very frightened um and have
[02:39:49.760 --> 02:39:54.080]  grabbed onto mommy as you say i think that it's like norah desmond from sunset boulevard where
[02:39:54.080 --> 02:39:58.800]  you know that film the famous film that billy wilder directed in the end where she's i'm ready
[02:39:58.800 --> 02:40:03.440]  for my close-up mr demille and it's a demented x movie star going down the stairs and having
[02:40:03.440 --> 02:40:08.000]  a nervous breakdown that's where hillary is in her political life great analogy thank you
[02:40:08.000 --> 02:40:14.800]  and what's the one where there's the two sisters and one's crazy dearest yeah no no who's afraid of
[02:40:14.800 --> 02:40:18.240]  baby something no whatever happened to baby jane we're exactly whatever happened to baby jane
[02:40:18.240 --> 02:40:21.840]  whatever happened to baby we're dating ourselves gentlemen that's that's that's hillary that's
[02:40:21.840 --> 02:40:26.000]  curious quick let's do some of the modern movies that's a hell yeah we're cars drive downhill for
[02:40:26.000 --> 02:40:31.280]  30 minutes running over boulders and don't blow a tire boom oh no it's worse than a cartoon at least
[02:40:31.280 --> 02:40:36.240]  you know with like looney tins when the rock falls on the cody and doesn't kill him that it's not real
[02:40:36.240 --> 02:40:40.320]  well let me let me introduce i mean there's something mickey meadow let me tell you why i'm
[02:40:40.320 --> 02:40:44.400]  introducing mickey mouse because mickey mouse is the reason why you have these draconian copyright
[02:40:44.400 --> 02:40:48.560]  laws in america yes every time mickey mouse is ready to enter the public domain they pass the
[02:40:48.560 --> 02:40:53.680]  copyright extension act and due to wall disney's corporate influence sonny bono famously did
[02:40:53.680 --> 02:40:59.840]  one the last time so copyright lasts for now for lifetime plus i think 73 73 or 75 years
[02:40:59.840 --> 02:41:06.720]  so you have an in a sense perpetual copyright which means that ideas are owned by the corporations
[02:41:06.720 --> 02:41:10.160]  and this is where they attack they'll attack new media this is where they'll attack well that's
[02:41:10.160 --> 02:41:15.600]  what drugs thought they would do you'll say on your show a phrase that they will claim is protected
[02:41:15.600 --> 02:41:22.080]  by copyright law and then that's how they will like pope francis is a turd burglar possibly disney
[02:41:22.080 --> 02:41:26.080]  might suggest that they well the mcdonald's corporation could say they own a hamburglar
[02:41:26.080 --> 02:41:30.560]  and you're violating uh the hamburgler name by saying turd burglar and therefore they have to
[02:41:30.560 --> 02:41:36.640]  you get an issue at dmca digital millennium copyright action and take our bonus they'll take
[02:41:36.640 --> 02:41:41.600]  it down but that's exactly right so even yet close enough to the name they'll say that's a copyright
[02:41:41.600 --> 02:41:46.640]  violation and they're expanding that under tpp that what that what she doesn't exist it's fake news
[02:41:46.640 --> 02:41:50.240]  yeah but oh hillary said she's against it even though she gave speeches saying she helped write
[02:41:50.240 --> 02:41:55.360]  tpp expands the copyright uh car i want to take some phone calls it's amazing we have max keiser
[02:41:55.360 --> 02:42:02.240]  at max keiser dot com uh let's go as we go to james steve uh brian uh david hector and a lot of
[02:42:02.240 --> 02:42:08.480]  folks here let's go to hawaii first uh and so let's talk to steven you're on the air thanks for calling
[02:42:10.080 --> 02:42:17.440]  hi alex hey buddy hey man i'm a huge fan then i even have your bohemian grove video from back
[02:42:17.440 --> 02:42:22.400]  in the 80s i've been following you for years i want to say i i appreciate what you do and i
[02:42:22.400 --> 02:42:27.760]  ask you guys to keep it up i got three things i want to mention for you real quick about the
[02:42:27.760 --> 02:42:33.520]  mainstream media it's not just the news that's being fake and pushing uh messages right now
[02:42:33.520 --> 02:42:39.200]  what people aren't paying attention to is it's also the regular television shows for instance um
[02:42:39.200 --> 02:42:44.320]  just yesterday supernatural a television show where you know a couple of guys go around they
[02:42:44.320 --> 02:42:49.360]  they're they're fighting evil fighting demons things like that they have to exercise lucifer
[02:42:49.360 --> 02:42:55.360]  out of the president of the united states does that sound like anything well i mean look listen
[02:42:56.240 --> 02:43:00.800]  half the time i stop on some new cartoon it's guys in tricorder hats trying to blow up the
[02:43:00.800 --> 02:43:05.440]  chemical plant and poison the public and then green lantern has to beat them exactly i would
[02:43:05.440 --> 02:43:11.360]  say 20 of the propaganda is now in news mainstream news but yes uh adam and max what about the
[02:43:11.360 --> 02:43:16.000]  propaganda placement they call it behavior placement or product placement is all over the place
[02:43:16.000 --> 02:43:21.600]  and look i'm not against any gay people i don't even care the point is it's just everywhere gay
[02:43:21.600 --> 02:43:26.480]  gay gay gay gay we know it's a push message or it's anti-family or it's anti-gun or it's
[02:43:26.480 --> 02:43:32.240]  anti-america or the terrorist is you know bad because he believes that there's a world government
[02:43:32.240 --> 02:43:37.120]  i mean it's just crazy the message i think the public's rejecting it but what's your comments
[02:43:37.120 --> 02:43:43.280]  on that well we actually uh uh talked about this in a way the other day and if you look at what
[02:43:43.280 --> 02:43:48.240]  norman lear did and he still has a big influence that you know things the lear foundation or
[02:43:48.240 --> 02:43:52.000]  something and they write storylines for hollywood and they're they're very open about it you know
[02:43:52.000 --> 02:43:56.560]  they they put storylines in the modern family and it can be about global warming or other
[02:43:56.560 --> 02:44:03.840]  social issues but really um back in the days we had archie bunker and archie bunker um became
[02:44:03.840 --> 02:44:08.560]  this grout we was a grouchy guy who hated the government and traditionally those guys were
[02:44:08.560 --> 02:44:15.360]  democrats but norman lear made archie bunker a republican and for years that became the face
[02:44:15.360 --> 02:44:20.640]  of what republicans look like on television i think that's kind of where the switch went from
[02:44:20.640 --> 02:44:25.120]  you know the republican party who i i read the slaves you know they were kind of uh on the
[02:44:25.120 --> 02:44:31.520]  good side of things and then archie bunker became the face of the a-hole uh republican i think that
[02:44:31.520 --> 02:44:37.040]  really set up and you're right in the 60s there's all these hundreds of letters most of them were
[02:44:37.040 --> 02:44:41.200]  online from lbj he wrote a lot of them from the cattleman suite down at the driscoll wheel
[02:44:41.200 --> 02:44:46.400]  was mischievous there didn't really live with his wife out of the ranch ladybird but little factoid
[02:44:47.360 --> 02:44:50.960]  and he was writing letters saying the republicans passed the civil rights act
[02:44:50.960 --> 02:44:54.400]  we got to do something about this damn eyes and hour all this other stuff you know we're
[02:44:54.400 --> 02:44:59.360]  got to get you know get the inwards on welfare to control them and they'll be voting democrat for
[02:44:59.360 --> 02:45:05.280]  a hundred years i got a plan and then here comes archie bunker a decade later to get people to flip
[02:45:05.280 --> 02:45:10.560]  to think no no the old racist curmudgeons they're not democrats they're republicans and as you said
[02:45:10.560 --> 02:45:15.280]  they've accredited with one show that's right more than anything with 30 million viewers 40
[02:45:15.280 --> 02:45:20.560]  million viewers every episode they convinced everybody of a total upside down world yeah
[02:45:20.560 --> 02:45:24.400]  so why is it not working now when they say anybody that wants to own a gun as a racist or
[02:45:24.400 --> 02:45:29.120]  anybody that is against obama cares a racist i think to a degree it is working i mean it's it's
[02:45:29.120 --> 02:45:35.200]  definitely i think that yeah i can i can only say i think people do believe that but there's a a
[02:45:35.200 --> 02:45:40.400]  segment of the population that is more switched on and that is because of alternative forms
[02:45:41.760 --> 02:45:45.920]  leading up to this Trump election very closely on twitter which was fascinating with Scott Adams
[02:45:46.560 --> 02:45:51.360]  the creator of delbert but he started writing and tweeting about persuasion and persuasion
[02:45:51.360 --> 02:45:55.360]  technologies and persuasion technology got him on it comes out of something called
[02:45:55.360 --> 02:46:00.240]  neuro linguistic programming and also comes out of the casino industry which is very good at
[02:46:00.880 --> 02:46:07.760]  persuading people to part with their money using technology using very advanced psychometrics like
[02:46:07.760 --> 02:46:12.640]  filling casinos with certain sense that get people to you know comfortable to losing their money or
[02:46:12.640 --> 02:46:17.600]  they program machines and slot machines to win at the exact moment when somebody's about to give up
[02:46:17.600 --> 02:46:21.760]  and walk away from the slot machine and remember trump is in the casino business he comes out of
[02:46:21.760 --> 02:46:26.240]  the casino business and he would be very familiar with that technology and how that works and that
[02:46:26.240 --> 02:46:32.640]  whole idea of persuasion technology getting people to you know you talk about fake news this would
[02:46:32.640 --> 02:46:38.080]  be fake empathy you need to create fake empathy sure it's it's it's pavlovian in fact speak of
[02:46:38.080 --> 02:46:43.200]  the devil that's just broken info wars dot com um merkel phalan this should go all over the
[02:46:43.200 --> 02:46:48.000]  web folks this is huge i heard this today and i meant to cover it but i just forgot i was so
[02:46:48.000 --> 02:46:53.760]  busy but now they've had to retract fake news newsweek retracts claim trump supporters boot
[02:46:53.760 --> 02:46:59.520]  john glenn i believe i was in total error that trump supporters boot glenn so now they first put
[02:46:59.520 --> 02:47:04.080]  it out to hurt him knowing everybody's sad about john glenn the first american into space and you
[02:47:04.080 --> 02:47:09.920]  know all the rest of it dying at 94 or whatever yesterday godspeed john glenn and then later
[02:47:09.920 --> 02:47:17.200]  they admit okay they didn't really do it in fact they were like oh john oh he died not boo oh is
[02:47:17.200 --> 02:47:23.680]  we're sad not boo but this shows how desperate they are you know when bruce springsteen comes
[02:47:23.680 --> 02:47:29.760]  appears anywhere people in the audience still need to be explained that people are saying bruce and
[02:47:29.760 --> 02:47:37.920]  not boo so this is so typical oh it's it's it's it's a very um it's an old tactic to just put out
[02:47:37.920 --> 02:47:42.160]  this uh false information that that's that is fake news by saying that they and they're the masters
[02:47:42.160 --> 02:47:47.600]  of it i mean i mean take take take the head of the mr son the head of the soft bank one of the
[02:47:47.600 --> 02:47:52.080]  biggest japanese banks trillions as you know he he comes and says i like your new plan 50
[02:47:52.080 --> 02:47:57.440]  million invested in high tech next year he walks up the elevator gives trump credit and then even
[02:47:57.440 --> 02:48:02.400]  the wall street journal he thinks more friendly says trump kept claiming credit just everything
[02:48:02.400 --> 02:48:07.920]  is twisted it's not even that it's like it makes you like trump because they're lying about him so
[02:48:07.920 --> 02:48:12.480]  much even if her stuff trump does i don't like well the thing that is just obviously you know
[02:48:12.480 --> 02:48:17.680]  happening is exactly the same type of attitude that a lot of people harbored towards president obama
[02:48:18.400 --> 02:48:24.160]  is now being harbored and expressed by the very same people who thought that was disgusting yes
[02:48:25.200 --> 02:48:28.800]  and we have a phrase in the netherlands which is what you say being yourself with the copter
[02:48:28.800 --> 02:48:33.760]  to health which means you are what you use someone else of i thought that meant why are you putting
[02:48:33.760 --> 02:48:38.080]  mayonnaise on my french fries well that was a problem too let's talk to james and arizona you're
[02:48:38.080 --> 02:48:44.080]  on the air with quite a trio i've got to say uh here's truly alex shones max keiser and of course
[02:48:44.080 --> 02:48:49.440]  we have the former top uh m tv star and so many other things you've done since then got your own
[02:48:49.440 --> 02:48:55.040]  powerful successful radio show right now adam curry joining us here in studio uh let's go to
[02:48:55.040 --> 02:49:02.880]  james and arizona you're on the air hey alex i've been watching you for a while um found you out
[02:49:02.880 --> 02:49:08.640]  i don't know about you during your rant with pierce morgan on gun control love that um that was a
[02:49:08.640 --> 02:49:14.640]  big moment for us we got we got millions of new listeners off that oh yeah i can definitely tell
[02:49:14.640 --> 02:49:18.640]  and it wasn't because he had a big audience he got picked up it was so big that was it was a great
[02:49:18.640 --> 02:49:23.760]  appearance it chased pierce out of the country yeah i'm sorry i apologize color go ahead james
[02:49:25.040 --> 02:49:31.280]  no that's all right um as a millennial i've actually been taking a look at this uh all
[02:49:31.280 --> 02:49:35.920]  fake news paradigm and i think the propaganda may have actually worked a little too well
[02:49:36.720 --> 02:49:42.000]  regarding hillary clinton because they were trying to as liberal would do um when i was
[02:49:42.000 --> 02:49:46.800]  in high school that they would try to propagate communism and socialism and because they did
[02:49:46.800 --> 02:49:53.200]  that to such a degree you have the complete and total socialist and you have the people who are
[02:49:53.200 --> 02:49:59.040]  the counterculture the free market and you only have those two paradigms now so oh i agree it's
[02:49:59.040 --> 02:50:04.480]  become very avant-garde and cutting edge to buck the system because it's so clear the
[02:50:04.480 --> 02:50:09.040]  entire power structure republican leadership democratic leadership the pope the communist
[02:50:09.040 --> 02:50:13.120]  chinese the the soddies everyone's saying we can't you know make america great again what do you

[02:50:20.240 --> 02:50:25.040]  the idea that we can make it work yeah that's the thing it's easy to bash america leave another
[02:50:25.040 --> 02:50:30.320]  country i lived in the netherlands i lived in belgium i lived in uh the uk uh the uk by the way

[02:55:27.600 --> 02:55:32.000]  us p-shirt and said congress needs to pass laws it's already passed the house to literally do
[02:55:32.000 --> 02:55:37.440]  stuff 50 times worse than mccarthy i mean i i cannot it's the best of times worst of times
[02:55:37.440 --> 02:55:41.680]  and sure it's fun to get attacked by all these people they're so discredited that it just mainly
[02:55:41.680 --> 02:55:46.160]  turns people on to you but they're still the unstable people i'm running into that literally see me
[02:55:46.160 --> 02:55:51.200]  and go to the other side of the street now and look at me like i am a murdering demon because of
[02:55:51.200 --> 02:55:55.520]  all the weird stuff they added together uh and you know the things they do like mpr videos goes
[02:55:55.520 --> 02:56:00.880]  like jones says hillary chops up children herself and murders them wash them post go to the article
[02:56:00.880 --> 02:56:05.680]  jones says hillary is responsible for killing children by funding rebels in syria that actually
[02:56:05.680 --> 02:56:10.720]  rape and murder and chop up children i mean it you know they it's a new level of deception it's very
[02:56:10.720 --> 02:56:14.560]  very serious and so let me ask you this question before we go back to calls i mean you're kind of
[02:56:14.560 --> 02:56:19.200]  some short segments here towards the end of start of the hour so i apologize for that is it the
[02:56:19.200 --> 02:56:23.920]  danger that we get so used to knowing we're right about a lot of these things that we laugh at the
[02:56:23.920 --> 02:56:28.960]  enemy but don't realize they're still in central control and then they just move forward and start
[02:56:28.960 --> 02:56:35.440]  a new war or cause an economic collapse or whatever the case may be well i would say i have high
[02:56:35.440 --> 02:56:41.040]  hopes for our new president so maybe some of that will go away but alex you're no different than
[02:56:41.040 --> 02:56:48.640]  than russia and putin you are just another enemy they and an enemy is needed and it's you i'm really
[02:56:48.640 --> 02:56:53.280]  happy it's you because i know you're a good guy i'm not worried about it but that they need an enemy
[02:56:53.280 --> 02:56:57.600]  and i think that's what's taking place here and that's all they got so they go for the biggest guy
[02:56:58.240 --> 02:57:02.000]  and uh we'll use you over and over again but i think you're right when you did the pierce
[02:57:02.000 --> 02:57:07.680]  morgan show you've got a lot of extra listeners and people glom on and oh yeah we had like we had
[02:57:07.680 --> 02:57:13.040]  like 10 million terrestrial listeners a week maybe a million and a half visitors the site that was
[02:57:13.040 --> 02:57:17.680]  good show it was like three four times that by the time the election hit and now it's
[02:57:18.800 --> 02:57:22.400]  double at least what it was for the election it's scary i think that's why they're attacking
[02:57:22.400 --> 02:57:27.440]  it's because they say we can practice on this guy and target and figure out what works on him
[02:57:27.440 --> 02:57:31.040]  then we'll work on everybody else i think that's what that's possible i think it's just targeting
[02:57:31.040 --> 02:57:38.560]  whether they'll be foolish to take you down then what max keiser he's no opponent well i let's stop
[02:57:38.560 --> 02:57:44.080]  saying i'm big max has probably a bigger show than i did yeah no doubt does the new york times
[02:57:44.080 --> 02:57:48.240]  ever contact me to comment about no that's because you clearly crossover liberal and
[02:57:48.240 --> 02:57:53.120]  conservative and and clearly are right on so many you're you're an authentic liberal you're an
[02:57:53.120 --> 02:57:58.640]  authentic liberal so they're scared to take you on they're they're on the ignore you face well i mean
[02:57:58.640 --> 02:58:04.720]  i have a big show on rt uh have been a thousand episodes and it's seen all over the world not a
[02:58:04.720 --> 02:58:11.440]  single media outlet america has contacted me to comment on this influence uh so-called of rt the
[02:58:11.440 --> 02:58:15.920]  russians run everything let's not call the big americans yeah i mean if you're really curious

[03:00:46.640 --> 03:00:51.760]  awareness that we all need thank you brother my initial my initial topic was based on the
[03:00:51.760 --> 03:00:58.320]  fact that i was unaware they repealed illegal propaganda and uh aside from that i still think
[03:00:58.320 --> 03:01:04.320]  there's there's a ways we can we the people need to stop just listening we've got to act i know
[03:01:04.320 --> 03:01:09.120]  there's millions of listeners there's got to be a few lawyers there's got to be a few prosecutors
[03:01:09.120 --> 03:01:15.440]  we've got to get on the board and and have like a national lawsuit against by the way
[03:01:15.440 --> 03:01:21.120]  lawsuits were being prepared against washington both for saying sites were russian agents because
[03:01:21.120 --> 03:01:25.760]  you can that that that is defamation they had to disclaim it and so they had to back off yesterday
[03:01:25.760 --> 03:01:28.800]  so the goodness is what you're saying is true we're not looking for trouble i was actually
[03:01:28.800 --> 03:01:33.280]  talking to lawyers about a suit because i'm not a russian agent you can't say that you say i'm
[03:01:33.280 --> 03:01:39.840]  faking this all day uh but uh so so you're absolutely right they are pushing that if anyone's
[03:01:39.840 --> 03:01:46.080]  pushing propaganda between russia and america it's me pushing propaganda into russia i mean since
[03:01:46.080 --> 03:01:50.800]  i've been doing my show the crownland has been aggressively buying gold exactly as i've been
[03:01:50.800 --> 03:01:55.920]  propagandizing them to do they've gone soft on bitcoin exactly as i've been propagandizing them
[03:01:55.920 --> 03:02:00.080]  they're becoming more pro-gun it's like i've been told it's become like the alex jones max kaiser
[03:02:00.080 --> 03:02:05.120]  show there essentially you could make the case that putin is my puppet um more easily that's a
[03:02:05.120 --> 03:02:10.000]  bumper sticker and you can say the other than the other one i want that okay this is my puppet hey i
[03:02:10.000 --> 03:02:14.640]  you can make that case a lot easier than you can and the other side no i agree they all
[03:02:14.640 --> 03:02:18.960]  of you's glad that you're a rock star in russia because you tune in and they're getting americana
[03:02:19.840 --> 03:02:25.040]  well it's it's a global you were approached by the you know besides the trump election you know
[03:02:25.040 --> 03:02:30.880]  i think you were also instrumental in brexit in that you totally energized nigel ferrage to go
[03:02:30.880 --> 03:02:36.640]  global people in the uk listen to your show they were exposed to nigel ferrage through info wars
[03:02:36.640 --> 03:02:40.800]  i don't have to do my horn but he says that on my show not through the bbc the bbc never had
[03:02:40.800 --> 03:02:45.600]  nigel ferrage on you know maybe a few times a toward the end there but for the past so i was
[03:02:45.600 --> 03:02:50.080]  having him on 15 years ago exactly you built his career he said when he'd knock on doors nobody
[03:02:50.080 --> 03:02:54.320]  knew what uke was like oh alex jones they're right in that's right so but it wasn't that i was that
[03:02:54.320 --> 03:02:59.520]  good the the media control left a vacuum so brits had to get their show from me absolutely
[03:02:59.520 --> 03:03:05.760]  plus they love paul watson paul watson is huge and and um but nigel ferrage i think also aside from
[03:03:05.760 --> 03:03:09.680]  this trump phenomenon is also tied directly to you know what it's fun to drink a bottle of red
[03:03:09.680 --> 03:03:15.440]  wine with him with trump ferrage ferrage oh yeah he likes he likes to drink oh yeah he likes his
[03:03:15.440 --> 03:03:20.960]  drink yeah he's a regular bloke we'll put the two of us together it's just well the mouth of the
[03:03:20.960 --> 03:03:26.400]  cartoon falls in the canyon okay please invite me though when that happens i wouldn't mind i've

[03:08:23.120 --> 03:08:33.040]  historically when governments move against free press major wars and absolute horrors
[03:08:33.040 --> 03:08:38.160]  are committed against the people as we speak the european union is openly calling to shut
[03:08:38.160 --> 03:08:43.440]  down the quote alt right in the united states and is ordering facebook google and others
[03:08:43.440 --> 03:08:50.720]  to censor info wars dot com by name if info wars can be silenced you could be silenced as well
[03:08:50.720 --> 03:08:57.360]  let's stand up for free press let's stand up for free speech not just during the u.s but worldwide
[03:08:57.920 --> 03:09:03.280]  that's what our bill of rights and constitution are all about that's why it's called the first
[03:09:03.280 --> 03:09:10.560]  amendment first because it is the most important if we shut down free speech the light goes out of
[03:09:10.560 --> 03:09:17.760]  the world there you go distinguishing the light of communication i tell you first they want the
[03:09:17.760 --> 03:09:21.920]  second amendment i told us they're coming out the first and now they're doing it briefly on nipples
[03:09:21.920 --> 03:09:25.440]  here's a question i got to plug some sponsors and ask you about what happens in the future when
[03:09:25.440 --> 03:09:28.800]  there's a blacklist though i guess you'll be afraid or others would have me on or if you're on a
[03:09:28.800 --> 03:09:33.920]  blacklist i can't have you on uh because then i'll get on a blacklist so then they'll be known
[03:09:33.920 --> 03:09:39.120]  to plumes but if the pin name or pseudonym writes something it'll be the information so i guess the
[03:09:39.120 --> 03:09:45.920]  pseudonym will then get on a blacklist you have to keep creating new pseudonyms yeah institutionalized
[03:09:45.920 --> 03:09:52.080]  psychosis multiple personality disorder as a feature and you need to practically go within
[03:09:52.080 --> 03:09:56.960]  yourself to come up with as many persona as possible and live a parallel existence i think
[03:09:56.960 --> 03:10:01.680]  that's pretty obvious solved just like what you're saying you know you look at the micro and you look
[03:10:01.680 --> 03:10:06.000]  at the macro but the trick is to actually see the macro you've got to look at the micro because then
[03:10:06.000 --> 03:10:12.240]  that's actually something giant just from far away and the enemy of these new sensors is time
[03:10:12.240 --> 03:10:15.760]  and what i mean by that is the example i give all the time you know when the plane went down the
[03:10:15.760 --> 03:10:20.080]  Hudson they were tweeting live from the wing of the plane we're here and we're safe and before
[03:10:20.080 --> 03:10:26.080]  any news crew could show up so any blacklist that comes up is going to be shot down before it gets
[03:10:26.080 --> 03:10:31.680]  any traction and you have real information warriors out there not you know only yourself but no people
[03:10:31.680 --> 03:10:35.680]  like 4chan who came up with oh they're the they're the people digging up all the goodies pepe the
[03:10:35.680 --> 03:10:40.880]  frog and things like that who really understand the meme war and the information war in a very
[03:10:40.880 --> 03:10:47.680]  meta very racist meta level uh they're the enemy that Hilary Clinton just discovered it the information
[03:10:47.680 --> 03:10:52.000]  war and they'll just the last two months of her campaign she didn't know who the campaign was all
[03:10:52.000 --> 03:10:56.880]  about on our mpr they go what is this info war right they're completely clueless about what's
[03:10:56.880 --> 03:11:03.120]  been going on for years now and so just catching up to it and meanwhile the people who are orchestrating
[03:11:03.120 --> 03:11:07.760]  again Scott Adams i think is really a genius guy who understands exactly what's going on he had him
[03:11:07.760 --> 03:11:12.480]  on on your show and the whole idea of subliminal persuasion technologies and technology is really
[03:11:12.480 --> 03:11:18.320]  taking hold in a big way and casino the casinofication of communications is Scott Adams needs uh
[03:11:18.320 --> 03:11:25.520]  needs to be commended for taking a huge hit in his personal business by doing this because he was
[03:11:25.520 --> 03:11:29.440]  very early on i think trump's going to win in the land that's right and he'd even endorsing
[03:11:29.440 --> 03:11:33.680]  well he said i'm in door i'm voting for Hilary because i don't want to get killed in california
[03:11:33.680 --> 03:11:39.360]  paraphrasing um but there's no doubt that really hurt is i'm sure he's fine but it hurt his business
[03:11:39.360 --> 03:11:44.960]  well sure what about how the modern left all day calls itself anti-bullies they're the biggest
[03:11:44.960 --> 03:11:50.640]  bullies i've ever seen yes i mean it's like what is your i don't see myself as right wings the thing
[03:11:50.640 --> 03:11:54.320]  i look at them i just thought they're like fascists or something nobody's a bigger bully than a left
[03:11:54.320 --> 03:11:58.560]  wing or scorned i mean they come out and they start to throw their weight around in a way that's
[03:11:58.560 --> 03:12:03.360]  completely um beyond what you'd expect these right wing to do i want to jam in a few final
[03:12:03.360 --> 03:12:07.360]  calls that are killing but but promise me that you'll come back anytime to curry and of course i
[03:12:07.360 --> 03:12:11.680]  i'm homeless so i live here now i think you're actually talking about maybe orbiting through

[03:14:28.240 --> 03:14:32.560]  do you have them here i won't it's drop ship though okay this is a sponsor we do sell some
[03:14:32.560 --> 03:14:36.960]  solar stuff at info wars tour dot com and we need to sell a lot of stuff i want i have a friend
[03:14:36.960 --> 03:14:41.680]  with an airplane and i'm going to ask him i want to jump start his plane with that it's not just
[03:14:41.680 --> 03:14:46.400]  solar power it's also gonad friction if you keep it in your pocket the friction that's enough
[03:14:46.400 --> 03:14:53.600]  the two testicles they cause enough energy you have metal the tidal forces of nature mr kaiser
[03:14:53.600 --> 03:15:00.960]  and you will atone you just haven't broken up some business deal here the arrows are taking the money
[03:15:00.960 --> 03:15:05.040]  out of the country and i'll even put it back in you've been going i love this you sit up there on
[03:15:05.040 --> 03:15:11.440]  your little you know 15 inch screen you tell us all about america and nations and peoples there are
[03:15:11.440 --> 03:15:16.640]  no more nations there are no more people ladies and gentlemen alex bue we are an international
[03:15:17.360 --> 03:15:22.400]  multivariate system of stock and companies i'm gonna go over that's a great bit that's one of my
[03:15:22.400 --> 03:15:27.920]  favorites absolutely but one testicle does hang lower than all right because if you're if you're
[03:15:27.920 --> 03:15:32.640]  at length i'm strong the clatter you don't want the testicles clack clack stop it like that family
[03:15:32.640 --> 03:15:38.720]  show everyone has gonads of the male persuasion there's nobody in a family it's made by males
[03:15:38.720 --> 03:15:42.880]  and females coming together and the male has testicles and gonad friction powers the device in
[03:15:42.880 --> 03:15:46.240]  your pocket along with the solar energy you can jump start an airplane that's all i'm saying
[03:15:48.400 --> 03:15:52.960]  that's all it is about and that's a satire that's comedy it's not fake news let me tell you they
[03:15:52.960 --> 03:15:59.200]  take jokes i do now they go jones believes goblins are with trump literally and he believes wasp
[03:15:59.200 --> 03:16:03.280]  run of the u n building like we make jokes they take it say it's real you know you actually it's
[03:16:03.280 --> 03:16:08.880]  real it's real it's real that's my favorite you know we're out you know where else satire was outlawed
[03:16:08.880 --> 03:16:13.840]  uh the soviet union hello america's becoming like the soviet union and thank you russia's
[03:16:13.840 --> 03:16:18.640]  becoming more like america all right all right let me finish this thought russia and america are
[03:16:18.640 --> 03:16:24.400]  two ships passing in the night where the the u.s is going towards sovietization and the russia's
[03:16:24.400 --> 03:16:31.280]  coming out and busting out and becoming like america in the 1950s you know putin is basically um ike
[03:16:31.280 --> 03:16:37.680]  he's eisenhower for the globe he's a global eisenhower and and uh hillary was basically

[03:17:13.520 --> 03:17:17.040]  you're the skipper you're the professor and i'm gilligan yeah all right there's a question
[03:17:17.040 --> 03:17:21.440]  you gotta ask all guys are you a marianne or a ginger type of guy i used to be ginger and
[03:17:21.440 --> 03:17:26.720]  then when i grew up i definitely went to marianne i agree with her the wrong answer you're both
[03:17:28.000 --> 03:17:32.720]  you know you're the king so of course you get it all no i'm just joking and what am i like i'm a
[03:17:32.720 --> 03:17:38.240]  family guy watch yourself kaiser and i'm left with a coconut is that what the exactly you're left
[03:17:38.240 --> 03:17:42.960]  with gilligan okay i think hillary i think hillary i think hillary definitely went for marianne
[03:17:42.960 --> 03:17:49.680]  oh yeah yeah and changer exactly in the new paradigm we we we just get to go do all the
[03:17:49.680 --> 03:17:54.080]  work and everything and get the coconuts and the bananas and yeah you know battle the weird
[03:17:54.080 --> 03:17:59.040]  headhunters like remember kona the headhunters are always attacking yeah why can't we have shows
[03:17:59.040 --> 03:18:02.640]  like that that are so stupid you can actually relax and watch them you definitely like the
[03:18:02.640 --> 03:18:14.480]  coconut zippers hey did you like uh did you like the adrema genie's genie oh my god they're running with the astronaut you know what's going on you know what's going on you know
[03:18:15.680 --> 03:18:21.280]  something visits her in the bottling yeah what about the way to be which woman twitched her nose
[03:18:21.840 --> 03:18:27.040]  you know yeah i'm uh they actually i don't want to get down that path let's not do that yeah i'm
[03:18:27.040 --> 03:18:30.800]  actually don't want to watch this is what happens great job everybody we love you good things are
[03:18:30.800 --> 03:18:35.280]  happening we love you uh nightly is night seven o'clock central ends coming up here is our great
[03:18:35.280 --> 03:18:43.200]  reporter in the midwest millie weaver what an amazing lady this is our best report
[03:18:44.400 --> 03:18:50.720]  millie weaver reporting for info wars dot com i'm here in phoenix arizona we're just this last weekend
[03:18:50.720 --> 03:18:57.200]  the freedom force international group held a conference here on the subject matter of climate
[03:18:57.200 --> 03:19:02.560]  change and the inconvenient lie that's being perpetuated by the mainstream media and other
[03:19:02.560 --> 03:19:09.840]  people such as al gore that man is responsible for climate change and that we need to all hurry up
[03:19:09.840 --> 03:19:16.640]  and take action in this well donald trump just met with al gore and we have all these mainstream
[03:19:16.640 --> 03:19:23.040]  media left as outlets touting that donald trump is going to veer from his campaign pledges and
[03:19:23.040 --> 03:19:29.840]  keep some of these regulations on the basis of man-made climate change the bulk of the time was
[03:19:29.840 --> 03:19:37.840]  with the president like donald trump uh i i found it an extremely interesting conversation uh and
[03:19:37.840 --> 03:19:43.920]  to be continued and i'm just going to leave it at that thank you well i have information that
[03:19:43.920 --> 03:19:50.320]  counters that i just met with a man this weekend named timothy ball that spoke at this conference
[03:19:50.320 --> 03:19:58.400]  who is scheduled to meet with donald trump's epa pic this is very important because this
[03:19:58.400 --> 03:20:05.360]  man has evidence that counters the beliefs and opinions of al gore so let's go ahead and hear
[03:20:05.360 --> 03:20:12.720]  what he has to say you're scheduled to meet with trump's uh advisors soon isn't that correct yeah
[03:20:12.720 --> 03:20:19.840]  well one of the things that um uh about 25 years ago i was appeared before congress on the climate
[03:20:19.840 --> 03:20:25.600]  issue and um i was also invited to speak at a place called the competitive enterprise institute
[03:20:25.600 --> 03:20:31.760]  i met a myron ebell and then at the heartland or climate conferences around uh i've met him
[03:20:31.760 --> 03:20:38.720]  several times is about a month before the election date he was notified by the trump people that he
[03:20:38.720 --> 03:20:46.960]  was going to be put in charge of deregulating epa so um was invited to go and meet with myron
[03:20:46.960 --> 03:20:54.000]  in in uh washington on the 12th of december and uh we'll lay out the issues he knows a lot of it
[03:20:54.000 --> 03:21:00.640]  but one of the things i think i can contribute is um providing with ways of explaining to the
[03:21:00.640 --> 03:21:08.000]  politicians and to the public the complexities when you burn ethanol which of course is plant
[03:21:08.000 --> 03:21:13.120]  produced and the government was telling people oh that when you burn ethanol there's less co2
[03:21:13.120 --> 03:21:19.280]  produced than from fossil fuel it's not true it's simply not true you when you burn ethanol you get
[03:21:19.280 --> 03:21:26.560]  far more co2 produced okay but what they did was they said oh well growing the plants takes co2
[03:21:26.560 --> 03:21:32.560]  out of the atmosphere so we're giving them a net figure but with the actual car going down the road
[03:21:33.280 --> 03:21:39.280]  the ethanol car is putting out far more co2 than the fossil fuel car and and and of course the
[03:21:39.280 --> 03:21:45.200]  government shifted the subsidies to corn producers that they got far more money if they produced
[03:21:45.200 --> 03:21:51.280]  the corn and it went to the ethanol plant than if it went to the food plant that led to a massive
[03:21:51.280 --> 03:21:58.800]  increase in basic food costs around the world and i'll show you how that links um when corn is
[03:21:58.800 --> 03:22:04.480]  basic and the price went up all of the other basic food supplies went up that led to food riots in
[03:22:04.480 --> 03:22:12.080]  egypt okay obama said oh no that's arab spring that's democracy no it wasn't there was a food
[03:22:12.080 --> 03:22:19.520]  riots wow but obama of course said oh wow we've got to get rid of husby mubarak because he wanted
[03:22:19.520 --> 03:22:25.040]  to put the muslim brotherhood in so he exploited a situation that his own policies in the corn
[03:22:25.040 --> 03:22:32.080]  market had created but this is the kinds of of clever and devious games that that they use what
[03:22:32.080 --> 03:22:39.680]  are some of the health or environmental effects that these supposed green energy projects can do
[03:22:40.480 --> 03:22:46.880]  well the the alternate energies of course are in terms of of the the the bird kills the bat kills
[03:22:46.880 --> 03:22:53.600]  the the the environmental damage the noise that they produce the the footprint in in order to
[03:22:53.600 --> 03:23:01.600]  replace a 1000 megawatt coal station you need acres and acres of land because the the turbines
[03:23:01.600 --> 03:23:08.640]  have got to be spread out because they interfere with each other if you go by a wind turbine field
[03:23:08.640 --> 03:23:15.280]  there's always one turbine turning that's being driven by electricity off the grid because you
[03:23:15.280 --> 03:23:22.800]  need that energy to get the other wind turbines started okay plus once you're using wind power as
[03:23:22.800 --> 03:23:29.600]  as a source of energy into the grid you can only use about 12 percent of your total energy production
[03:23:29.600 --> 03:23:39.760]  from wind or solar because if if it disappears the system will draw on on the grid and so the
[03:23:39.760 --> 03:23:45.120]  grid has to be able to pick up that power demand instantly so what people don't know is when the
[03:23:45.120 --> 03:23:51.200]  wind turbines are turning the coal plant is also running so again this goes back to this
[03:23:51.200 --> 03:24:00.080]  problem of of doing proper cost benefit analysis and that is just missing in every phase of this whole
[03:24:00.080 --> 03:24:05.840]  environmental scam and and that needs to be looked at and particularly if it's if it's a project like
[03:24:05.840 --> 03:24:11.120]  a wind project the government don't want to hear about the problems with it they suppress all of
[03:24:11.120 --> 03:24:17.280]  that and but there are so many side effects one of the things that's concerned me for a long time
[03:24:17.280 --> 03:24:25.840]  is is noise pollution in our atmosphere and like I I have artificial ears because flying without
[03:24:25.840 --> 03:24:34.160]  proper hearing protection but but the noise issue and its ability to excite the cells and and trigger
[03:24:34.160 --> 03:24:41.680]  all sorts of reactions it's obvious that there's a problem the biggest climate events that affect
[03:24:41.680 --> 03:24:47.680]  humans and animals are floods and droughts and and droughts in particular and you know in the US
[03:24:47.680 --> 03:24:55.680]  here virtually no research done on that and and yet those those are huge issue and water resources
[03:24:55.680 --> 03:25:01.840]  the quality of water I mean you saw the Flint Michigan situation that's criminal in today's
[03:25:01.840 --> 03:25:10.720]  world but the water issue it to me is another one that simply has not received attention
[03:25:10.720 --> 03:25:16.560]  because of the focus on on the global warming issue are you going to advise for him to kind
[03:25:16.560 --> 03:25:22.960]  of defund some of these different green energy projects you withdraw the funding the whole
[03:25:22.960 --> 03:25:30.160]  thing dies if there was anything if there was anything in it and there was some money to be
[03:25:30.160 --> 03:25:35.120]  made in it then private industry would step in and fill that need right away but but the fact
[03:25:35.120 --> 03:25:41.440]  they haven't proves that there is nothing Trump is is is not going to ignore regulations I mean
[03:25:41.440 --> 03:25:47.200]  he's actually said it he said we can't get rid of the EPA completely we do need to look after
[03:25:47.200 --> 03:25:53.280]  our planet we do need to deal with pollution and so on but but there are so many other issues that
[03:25:53.280 --> 03:26:00.240]  are are complete non issues that if we we took that money and spend it where it's needed we could
[03:26:00.240 --> 03:26:05.840]  be far more effective and of course that's the whole idea about about a business person is how
[03:26:05.840 --> 03:26:11.280]  do I spend my dollars most effectively and and so that's what I'm hoping to be able to do is say
[03:26:11.280 --> 03:26:17.600]  look you don't need to spend money here CO2 is not a problem and therefore the money you're spending
[03:26:17.600 --> 03:26:24.400]  there which is about 70 billion dollars a year can go to some other you know for example clean water
[03:26:24.400 --> 03:26:30.800]  supply in every city in America in every community in America and and and this is the problem that
[03:26:30.800 --> 03:26:36.080]  real issues have been pushed aside by these phony issues and they talk about fake news this is
[03:26:36.080 --> 03:26:43.120]  fake science yeah but for a political agenda the concerns that these media outlets are perpetuating
[03:26:43.120 --> 03:26:50.160]  that Donald is going to veer from his campaign pledges are simply inaccurate and it's just to
[03:26:50.160 --> 03:26:57.200]  try and make donald look bad in any way possible just more fake news from the mainstream media
[03:26:57.200 --> 03:27:06.080]  this is millie weaver signing off for info wars dot com
[03:27:11.520 --> 03:27:16.800]  welcome back i'm joined in studio by leon macadoo here we are fourth hour live it's our first time

[03:27:42.560 --> 03:27:51.440]  um reddit of course is the the latest uh social media outlet out there to shadow ban info wars
[03:27:51.440 --> 03:27:55.920]  calling us fake news and other things so the war on free speech has accelerated we're going to get
[03:27:55.920 --> 03:28:02.240]  into that we knew that steve hoffman was actually anti-trump he he took the audacity of this man
[03:28:02.240 --> 03:28:08.160]  steve hoffman is the owner and ceo of reddit not owner just ceo and he was very anti-trump from
[03:28:08.160 --> 03:28:14.480]  the beginning monitoring streams we're seeing a war it's a censorship war in this country like no other
[03:28:14.480 --> 03:28:19.200]  and uh we're going to take on the real fake news here actually at least the fascists are revealing
[03:28:19.200 --> 03:28:22.480]  themselves that's right what do you make of this michael more peace this uh he's predicting
[03:28:22.480 --> 03:28:27.920]  tremble quit before the inauguration because he's bummed out by the amount of work get real dude
[03:28:27.920 --> 03:28:33.840]  you know i love chubby guys i really i have a chubby guy i think this guy though sloppy idios
[03:28:33.840 --> 03:28:39.200]  seed to a new well he he he does a documentary like what once every few years or something
[03:28:39.200 --> 03:28:43.840]  meanwhile donald trump is a very successful businessman however many businesses he's and
[03:28:43.840 --> 03:28:48.320]  they're kind of picking picking at him because he wants to continue being the executive producer
[03:28:48.320 --> 03:28:52.880]  of his television show while also being president so yeah i'm sure he's it's just gonna be too much
[03:28:52.880 --> 03:28:57.920]  work for donald trump right well he's telling this to seth mires who's sort of the court gesture of
[03:28:57.920 --> 03:29:04.720]  obama's presidency um that trump he just thinks that you know it's too much work he's not gonna be
[03:29:04.720 --> 03:29:10.400]  we're talking about a man who i don't think he sleeps okay where he was doing like six or seven
[03:29:10.400 --> 03:29:14.880]  campaign stops a day meanwhile hillary clinton that was something that really affected her campaign
[03:29:14.880 --> 03:29:20.480]  was because she was nowhere to be found after she had that meteoric rise after the dnc then she
[03:29:20.480 --> 03:29:24.640]  she was in sleeping in bed meanwhile he's doing seven get too much work for him though do you
[03:29:24.640 --> 03:29:29.360]  remember dana bash asking him about his work ethic you know the man had gone through he stopped to
[03:29:29.360 --> 03:29:34.240]  open up a hotel which was basically how dare you take time out of campaigning do you really think

[03:33:36.480 --> 03:33:43.680]  for quite some time from iowa brian you're on the air with us what's going on hi i just wanted to
[03:33:43.680 --> 03:33:48.480]  call and tell you guys uh i got a couple points but first one i wanted to say thank you for all
[03:33:48.480 --> 03:33:55.680]  the amazing work you guys do uh at info wars thank you thank you you're part of the info war so
[03:33:55.680 --> 03:34:04.480]  thank you thank you and i wanted to uh to tell uh alex um i think one of the most important things
[03:34:04.480 --> 03:34:10.880]  that he talks about is is his belief in god and jesus christ um i have not always been the most
[03:34:10.880 --> 03:34:16.720]  faithful christian and had temporarily questioned my faith at different part point or different
[03:34:16.720 --> 03:34:21.680]  points in my life by listening to fake science and i wanted to tell your listeners that in the
[03:34:21.680 --> 03:34:26.560]  last several months i felt god's presence and love and there is no doubt that god is real
[03:34:26.560 --> 03:34:33.360]  and he loves all of us um i think that if we want to beat the evil we are up against
[03:34:33.360 --> 03:34:38.480]  we as a people need to find our way back to god and jesus christ um you don't you don't
[03:34:38.480 --> 03:34:43.040]  need a church necessarily to be close with god you can speak to him at any time through prayer
[03:34:44.640 --> 03:34:50.320]  absolutely that's on a final note oh go ahead yeah you're you're absolutely right it is a spiritual
[03:34:50.320 --> 03:34:55.280]  battle and it's kind of one of the big lies is that you need a church to you know go inside god's
[03:34:55.280 --> 03:35:02.160]  right there uh last points brian speak directly to god through prayer and on a final note um i
[03:35:02.160 --> 03:35:08.240]  think that donald trump has been so successful because he is the american american dream personified
[03:35:08.240 --> 03:35:13.520]  and is the true champion of the american people um the way he campaigned using his own money
[03:35:13.520 --> 03:35:19.360]  allowed him to showcase his success while at the same time emphasizing his self sacrifice to serve
[03:35:19.360 --> 03:35:25.600]  the country he loves so i'd like to say thank you to president elect trump for your sacrifices and
[03:35:25.600 --> 03:35:30.960]  your family sacrifices to go through this trial by fire for the american people now with you brian
[03:35:30.960 --> 03:35:35.040]  let's go to jeff thank you so much for calling jeff has been holding for quite some time jeff
[03:35:35.040 --> 03:35:41.760]  you're on the air with leanna myself how are you doing i'm doing fantastic uh good job ladies
[03:35:42.880 --> 03:35:48.960]  great fieldwork you did um i'd like to talk about crisis and like well immanuel said uh
[03:35:48.960 --> 03:35:53.520]  you know you can never let a good crisis go to waste the mainstream media is in a crisis right
[03:35:53.520 --> 03:35:58.400]  now because they're not controlling the narrative right and since we're we're we're talking about
[03:35:59.040 --> 03:36:03.920]  you know climate and weather and everything we we really can't have a conversation about that
[03:36:03.920 --> 03:36:09.120]  unless we talk about geoengineering which is you know which is happening nobody wants to talk about
[03:36:09.120 --> 03:36:15.280]  it you know um i wish it wasn't happening i live in southern california here and it's it's it's
[03:36:15.280 --> 03:36:20.480]  mind blowing what what you know what we see every day here and so i think that that now
[03:36:21.120 --> 03:36:26.080]  that we're controlling the narrative uh info wars and and and the real media and you know
[03:36:26.080 --> 03:36:32.000]  there's the fake news right um but we should talk about these fake chemtrails that really don't exist
[03:36:32.000 --> 03:36:39.920]  and and the geoengineering and um and really spotlight uh that issue i think it's a great
[03:36:39.920 --> 03:36:45.120]  time to do that what do you what do you think i mean well yeah i mean absolutely i think one of the
[03:36:45.120 --> 03:36:49.920]  most powerful ways to do that is by using their own language against them and by going and showing
[03:36:49.920 --> 03:36:55.280]  people the bills uh that are passed through congress that these won't be used as weapons of war uh
[03:36:55.280 --> 03:36:59.920]  that it is happening not only that jeff your first point about rama manual i was so disappointed
[03:36:59.920 --> 03:37:04.000]  you know trump's been entertaining a lot of people in trump tower rama manual of course uh went to
[03:37:04.000 --> 03:37:10.320]  talk about immigration and look i felt like you know his policy you know he was basically bullying
[03:37:10.320 --> 03:37:15.040]  trump in the media saying we're a sanctuary city we're not going to honor you i didn't really like
[03:37:15.040 --> 03:37:20.080]  the fact that uh trump had entertained him to listen to his immigration stance do you find that
[03:37:20.080 --> 03:37:25.840]  as concerning as i do just back to your first point you know i there's there's a lot of things
[03:37:25.840 --> 03:37:32.880]  that i question but but i uh i trust you know i just have a level of trust of what what he's doing
[03:37:32.880 --> 03:37:38.480]  you know i i think that he's smart i'm not sure what his game plan is uh with him uh meeting with
[03:37:38.480 --> 03:37:45.600]  with people that uh that are very questionable uh you know clearly you know the opposition you know
[03:37:45.600 --> 03:37:50.240]  from from their records um so i don't know what what you know what he what exactly what he's doing
[03:37:50.240 --> 03:37:54.960]  but but i just i just have a level of trust in in what he's doing but i but i think that we need
[03:37:54.960 --> 03:38:02.320]  to help him because everybody knows that you know that don't uh he's not tech savvy doesn't get a
[03:38:02.320 --> 03:38:07.040]  lot of his information from the internet he you know he's grown up reading the paper and watching
[03:38:07.040 --> 03:38:13.200]  the news and so i think that it's important that the the rest of us get behind him and educate him
[03:38:14.320 --> 03:38:20.720]  however we can do that um but i think uh i think we just need to watch and see what what he's doing
[03:38:20.720 --> 03:38:27.120]  but but i agree with you yeah i i i it's very disturbing uh to see him uh you know meeting
[03:38:27.120 --> 03:38:32.640]  with certain individuals that you know clearly um overraise the red flags for all of us jeff thank
[03:38:32.640 --> 03:38:37.600]  you so much and it's true you know we do see him meeting with people like kissinger you know
[03:38:37.600 --> 03:38:42.160]  you're thinking well what the heck but he's been a businessman he's been around these people for
[03:38:42.160 --> 03:38:46.960]  quite some time he kind of knows what he's dealing with there in the swamp but i think it speaks volumes
[03:38:46.960 --> 03:38:51.680]  that he has uh steve bannon there i do too and that's that right there lets you know that he's
[03:38:51.680 --> 03:38:56.320]  got someone who's in a top position that's i love that color's point to stand behind him and that's
[03:38:56.320 --> 03:39:01.200]  exactly what we're doing you know the past eight weeks we have been hammering hammering hammering
[03:39:01.200 --> 03:39:06.080]  clinton and now that trumpson office we all want to see him make good on these promises it's a little
[03:39:06.080 --> 03:39:11.040]  disconcerting when you've got people like rama manual who is arguably the godfather of chicago
[03:39:11.600 --> 03:39:16.560]  making his case for immigration it's a but we're going to stand behind him we're trying as accelerated
[03:39:16.560 --> 03:39:21.120]  under him one more caller john from texas you've been holding a while hi john you're on with liana
[03:39:21.120 --> 03:39:27.840]  myself how are you i'm great actually what did you want to talk about banker globalist elite
[03:39:27.840 --> 03:39:34.960]  takeover yes i'm a banker i graduated texas state and started working in the banking industry in
[03:39:34.960 --> 03:39:41.680]  07 before the crash and have seen what a lot of these elitists and bankers have done to really
[03:39:41.680 --> 03:39:47.760]  just manipulate and completely control the system and people just don't really realize what's going
[03:39:47.760 --> 03:39:53.760]  on they don't realize that in the early 90s the top five or six banks in the world in the united
[03:39:53.760 --> 03:40:00.640]  states controlled only roughly 10 of the assets which nowadays it's 15 trillion now they control
[03:40:00.640 --> 03:40:06.240]  about 50 of the world's assets which is just crazy that just shows in such a short time
[03:40:06.240 --> 03:40:10.560]  how far they've come and how far they're going to go because nobody's stopping them nobody's
[03:40:10.560 --> 03:40:14.800]  standing up they have all these black lists why don't we have a patriot list where we only do
[03:40:14.800 --> 03:40:19.680]  business with conservatives with similar ideals and values uh why don't we counter what they're
[03:40:19.680 --> 03:40:24.240]  doing by hitting them to where it hurts in their pockets right exactly like uh just for instance
[03:40:24.240 --> 03:40:29.520]  with all of the advertisers who are trying to blacklist breitbart and so people are pushing
[03:40:29.520 --> 03:40:33.360]  back saying you know what if you're not going to advertise on breitbart then screw you we're not
[03:40:33.360 --> 03:40:37.680]  going to buy your products and we're going to vote with our dollars and we all get behind and support
[03:40:37.680 --> 03:40:42.400]  breitbart in this effort that really chapped me that bmw story where they're going to yank
[03:40:42.400 --> 03:40:49.520]  their advertisements from by breitbart news um one of the most popular news sites globally uh okay
[03:40:49.520 --> 03:40:53.920]  yeah that makes a lot of sense so they'll shoot themselves in the foot to avoid meanwhile it's
[03:40:53.920 --> 03:40:59.280]  totally fine mike sernovich was actually uh posting this on his twitter it's you'll see all these
[03:40:59.280 --> 03:41:05.680]  advertisements for grubhub and others on salon.com with the pedophile article where it's basically
[03:41:05.680 --> 03:41:10.080]  making the case i'm a pedophile not a monster and then you see all these advertisements
[03:41:10.080 --> 03:41:16.880]  are hp are you okay that you're advertising next to uh an article advocating pedophilia i mean
[03:41:16.880 --> 03:41:21.600]  they want to normalize it john and i i love your point about how you know we should take a stand
[03:41:21.600 --> 03:41:26.240]  and we should actually honor patriots in business but at the same time you know if you believe in
[03:41:26.240 --> 03:41:30.800]  liberty you want to do business with everyone regardless politics should not be a part of
[03:41:30.800 --> 03:41:35.680]  business right and that's why they make the mistake is when they do try to politicize yeah
[03:41:35.680 --> 03:41:41.360]  like just make the frosted flakes and you know and leave me alone stay out of it exactly john thank you
[03:41:41.360 --> 03:41:46.960]  so much all right well leon i wanted to talk about this with you and i hopefully we get it
[03:41:46.960 --> 03:41:51.360]  i know you've got something i'll let you go up we're gonna get to russian at this russian hacker
[03:41:51.360 --> 03:41:57.440]  story and how this order of an intelligence report that's being led by republicans by the way um
[03:41:57.440 --> 03:42:01.280]  if you can believe this is still going on but you brought us something about isis well no it's
[03:42:01.280 --> 03:42:05.760]  just it's they're really pushing and i want everyone out there to just understand the huge
[03:42:05.760 --> 03:42:11.840]  sci-op that is happening still and will continue on happening they're really trying to ramp up this
[03:42:11.840 --> 03:42:16.320]  effort that this election is illegitimate the russians helped donald trump by creating all this
[03:42:16.320 --> 03:42:21.760]  fake news and and pushing out this propaganda uh the electoral college got him in he didn't win
[03:42:21.760 --> 03:42:26.800]  the popular vote and of course that's what uh michael moore was really pushing less uh on seph
[03:42:26.800 --> 03:42:31.280]  meyers is that you know he didn't really actually win because he didn't win the popular vote and
[03:42:31.280 --> 03:42:36.000]  he said they're really trying to make people feel as though this is an illegitimate election
[03:42:36.000 --> 03:42:42.400]  and well get this insane new york times obviously fake news but i had to pull this i visit their
[03:42:42.400 --> 03:42:46.960]  site anyway i can't help myself you know we're reporters we check out the news look at it all
[03:42:46.960 --> 03:42:51.600]  um obama orders intelligence report and russian election hacking they're still not letting this
[03:42:51.600 --> 03:42:57.360]  go folks and then the very first line obama has ordered american intelligence agencies
[03:42:57.360 --> 03:43:02.960]  to produce a full report on russian efforts to influence the 2016 presidential election
[03:43:02.960 --> 03:43:09.440]  so he's tying up dhs with this type stuff to investigate the russians because those battle
[03:43:09.440 --> 03:43:14.320]  russians you know they're the reasons donald trump's in office and uh i mean max keiser was just
[03:43:14.320 --> 03:43:23.120]  here who's i know rt reporter and uh i can tell you right now you know that content is really
[03:43:23.120 --> 03:43:29.200]  uncensored they basically let us say whatever we want to say um which is uh it shouldn't be news if
[03:43:29.200 --> 03:43:33.680]  you're if you're listening to it because of that phone ringing from the kremlin there isn't one um
[03:43:33.680 --> 03:43:37.760]  at all and i you know they're not going to let this die what do you think this says about their
[03:43:37.760 --> 03:43:43.040]  credibility or just desperation maybe well and so there's a great article up on the intercept
[03:43:43.040 --> 03:43:49.120]  where uh pointing out just one of the the phrase fake news and how it is um the people that are
[03:43:49.120 --> 03:43:53.120]  most aggressively disseminating that this fake news fake news are the people that are pushing it
[03:43:53.120 --> 03:43:59.040]  one thing he points out with the wiki leaks is one of the biggest fake news pieces that came out that
[03:43:59.040 --> 03:44:05.120]  msnbc and others really ran with was the fact that the wiki leaks emails were doctored we can't
[03:44:05.120 --> 03:44:09.680]  even look at them we can't even open up the russians and hackers are altering the emails
[03:44:09.680 --> 03:44:14.640]  don't you know don't look into john pedestas emails because they've been altered and so the news
[03:44:14.640 --> 03:44:19.840]  they just said well okay they've been altered um experts say we're getting you know officials
[03:44:19.840 --> 03:44:25.440]  tell us that these emails wiki leaks have been doctored with no proof whatsoever it would be
[03:44:25.440 --> 03:44:30.480]  so simple to to take your computer and say here's the email i sent and then here's what's on wiki
[03:44:30.480 --> 03:44:35.440]  leaks obviously fabricated but they they didn't do that they just pushed out this narrative that
[03:44:35.440 --> 03:44:39.840]  they've been altered so don't even open them well they have to you know make wiki leaks
[03:44:39.840 --> 03:44:44.400]  illegitimate they've got to bastardize it however they can so that we don't look at it do you remember
[03:44:44.400 --> 03:44:48.640]  donna brazil saying that uh she thought it was a crime cnn was pushing us for a long time they
[03:44:48.640 --> 03:44:54.080]  thought it was a crime to look at these emails oh you're a criminal if you look at wiki leaks
[03:44:54.080 --> 03:44:59.840]  really uh okay yeah i guess we're all criminals yeah because i've been looking at we are deplorable
[03:44:59.840 --> 03:45:04.640]  right so we are deplorable looking into you know with investigative journalism also known as
[03:45:04.640 --> 03:45:10.320]  conspiracy theorist speaking of you know something else that was some fake news we pumped out quite
[03:45:10.320 --> 03:45:15.840]  some time ago was the fact that uh arming and funding isis and other uh terrorist organizations
[03:45:16.560 --> 03:45:20.720]  well that was you know fake fake news or whatever but of course we forced that to come out it is
[03:45:20.720 --> 03:45:27.520]  true and now uh lawmakers uh tulsi gabbert actually introduced this bill the democrat from hawaii
[03:45:27.520 --> 03:45:33.840]  stop arming terrorist act so this is a bill introduced it aims to protect us tax payers
[03:45:33.840 --> 03:45:39.040]  dollars from being spent on supporting and arming international terrorist groups through covert
[03:45:39.040 --> 03:45:46.320]  operations and third states so you know here they're basically saying look we are there's this
[03:45:46.320 --> 03:45:51.360]  widely reported us practice of indirectly sponsoring terrorism and so they want to make it illegal for
[03:45:51.360 --> 03:45:57.200]  any u.s government agency to assist extremist groups directly or indirectly be it through the
[03:45:57.200 --> 03:46:02.640]  sale of weapons field training or intelligence assistance because she's she and other lawmakers
[03:46:02.640 --> 03:46:08.640]  they're saying look if you or i were providing them assistance or a uh giving them intelligence we'd
[03:46:08.640 --> 03:46:13.280]  be in prison lian they do this with without shame do you remember jonna kane going on the ground
[03:46:13.280 --> 03:46:17.920]  and saying we need to arm these people they're humanitarian no they weren't you know can you
[03:46:17.920 --> 03:46:23.200]  imagine if syria did that to us they found a crazy group of i don't know neo nazis for example
[03:46:23.200 --> 03:46:28.400]  somewhere and decided to arm them because it's their humanitarian right to do so or even you
[03:46:28.400 --> 03:46:32.560]  know arming the people who want to overthrow president-elect donald trump right i mean there's a
[03:46:32.560 --> 03:46:36.800]  bunch of crazies out there that would be willing to take up arms and and take donald trump out i
[03:46:36.800 --> 03:46:43.040]  mean so then you have this rogue government coming in and arming the the moderate the protesters the
[03:46:43.040 --> 03:46:48.080]  moderate it's it's madness it is madness we're going to take a second now you know we do this

[03:50:07.520 --> 03:50:12.240]  because of all the hostility that's been expressed toward them we cover these cases often
[03:50:13.040 --> 03:50:17.120]  and uh specifically we're going to get more into this yeah but i mean it's just like the snowflakes
[03:50:17.120 --> 03:50:21.840]  of the season they're all around and of course the trump supporters they don't want these safe
[03:50:21.840 --> 03:50:26.720]  spaces but frankly they need them when you have these people coming out protesting conservative

[03:54:13.360 --> 03:54:18.880]  welcome back to the alex jones show where you're host leon macadoo and margaret hell in studio
[03:54:18.880 --> 03:54:23.760]  talking about the latest breaking information we're going to take you to the story about how
[03:54:23.760 --> 03:54:30.400]  this teacher is calling a trump victory an act of terrorism literally i cannot make this up we're
[03:54:30.400 --> 03:54:35.120]  really going to be in a civil war she says and then she talks about coping with the election
[03:54:35.120 --> 03:54:39.760]  lost i don't know about you but these cry babies they're really starting to freak me out we saw
[03:54:39.760 --> 03:54:44.800]  this obama the supporter this dnc contributor and i think her name was margaret clifton
[03:54:44.800 --> 03:54:49.680]  she broke down and started crying on the air and then hillary clinton goes to harry reed's party
[03:54:49.680 --> 03:54:53.760]  going away party yesterday we got the crying sisters over there too now we have a great
[03:54:53.760 --> 03:54:58.800]  advantage of crying and enjoying women what is going i mean the tears flowing out you know what
[03:54:58.800 --> 03:55:03.760]  though the real culprit the real criminal in the story is a little student who got it on tape
[03:55:03.760 --> 03:55:13.440]  right and it's the student that is facing expulsion oh my god it's like they're crying
[03:55:13.440 --> 03:55:18.240]  for their dear leader it's like in north korea when they demand that all the north koreans cry
[03:55:18.240 --> 03:55:23.920]  for the dear leader that's what that feels like to me it's sick totally you talk about a brainwashing
[03:55:23.920 --> 03:55:29.280]  and i mean i'd be crying enjoy that harry reed is leaving frankly right it's a celebration that
[03:55:29.280 --> 03:55:34.480]  would be it would be a celebratory tear but these they hold it together people i mean it's not the
[03:55:34.480 --> 03:55:39.200]  end of the world in fact more people now are saying you know what i don't think trump's that bad
[03:55:39.200 --> 03:55:43.840]  he's already creating jobs he's already making some big some deals we're already winning so we're
[03:55:43.840 --> 03:55:47.440]  winning let's give him a shot we're winning but the thing with the story you mentioned is that
[03:55:47.440 --> 03:55:53.600]  it's the student who's facing expulsion for capturing this teacher's rhetoric i mean imagine
[03:55:53.600 --> 03:55:59.600]  what's being taught in classrooms it's not getting caught on film and you know the the 2030 agenda
[03:55:59.600 --> 03:56:04.480]  that they want everything is going to be filmed in the future so right she shouldn't be concerned
[03:56:04.480 --> 03:56:10.080]  about this type of thought psychology professor olga peres stable cock she's got a few last names
[03:56:10.080 --> 03:56:16.240]  going on there uh label donald trump's victory in active terrorism and it seems to suggest that he is
[03:56:16.240 --> 03:56:20.800]  a white supremacist so you know what i am so freaking sick and tired of hearing about how
[03:56:20.800 --> 03:56:26.800]  donald trump and stevenon are white supremacist i literally it makes me it doesn't make me angry
[03:56:26.800 --> 03:56:31.040]  especially from the establishment media right it's so dangerous you got people on the hill
[03:56:31.040 --> 03:56:37.120]  leon like this little republican lindsay graham and uh he's gonna launch this wide-ranging probe
[03:56:37.760 --> 03:56:42.080]  into russia and i hate to harp on russia but you know what we had max keiser in today
[03:56:42.080 --> 03:56:47.440]  and i'm jumping around a little bit here but my point is it's not just the democrats there are some
[03:56:47.440 --> 03:56:53.120]  really interesting republicans on the other side oh absolutely well that's it we we are we're always
[03:56:53.120 --> 03:56:57.440]  pointing out it's uh two sides of the same coin just as they just want you to think it's the
[03:56:57.440 --> 03:57:04.160]  left right divide right so you know what propaganda piece for crimson no no we're not uh but i'm
[03:57:04.160 --> 03:57:08.480]  going to start calling out msnbc as being a propaganda piece for what should we call them
[03:57:08.480 --> 03:57:13.920]  globalist shills i'm exactly shills for the globalist agenda and that's why we have uh
[03:57:13.920 --> 03:57:21.520]  joe biden on his sort of farewell tour and he hails uh was justin trudeau and angola merkel as the
[03:57:21.520 --> 03:57:27.600]  last liberal leaders standing there's more and more challenges to the liberal international order
[03:57:27.600 --> 03:57:34.240]  and he says i've never seen europe engaged in as much self-doubt so they're doubting themselves
[03:57:34.240 --> 03:57:39.520]  by overthrowing these globalists this liberal uh international order that has taken over
[03:57:39.520 --> 03:57:44.480]  it's everyone else out there who's confused all of these countries all this pushback it's everyone
[03:57:44.480 --> 03:57:49.680]  else who is confused about about how they think that their life should go they you know we still
[03:57:49.680 --> 03:57:54.160]  don't know what's best for us we still need these elites ruling over us because we're so stupid it's
[03:57:54.160 --> 03:57:58.400]  not that people are pushing back against this globalist agenda the attack on the family christianity
[03:57:58.400 --> 03:58:03.760]  individualism what do you make of him saying that angola merkel is one of the last liberal leaders
[03:58:03.760 --> 03:58:08.320]  what you talk about fake news right here thank god the woman's in a fight for her life actually
[03:58:08.320 --> 03:58:12.880]  she won't be standing too long for us you know what we're running out of quickly running out of time
