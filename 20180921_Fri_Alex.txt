[00:00.000 --> 00:27.640]  We're now only 46 days away from the most important election in world history.
[00:27.640 --> 00:33.080]  All the roads lead together at this great crossroads and the globalists, the Chinese
[00:33.080 --> 00:39.800]  Communists, the unelected dictatorial EU, the America-hating Hollywood, and the coastal
[00:39.800 --> 00:45.720]  elites are hell-bent on driving the populist awakening into the sea.
[00:45.720 --> 00:46.720]  That's not going to happen.
[00:46.720 --> 00:52.080]  As long as those of us on the cutting edge of the fight stay the course.
[00:52.080 --> 00:57.040]  Don't falter and don't waver and realize it's a great honor to be in the middle of history
[00:57.040 --> 00:58.040]  taking place.
[00:58.040 --> 01:03.040]  No, ladies and gentlemen, we're not watching science fiction adventure movies with super
[01:03.040 --> 01:04.640]  action heroes.
[01:04.640 --> 01:09.360]  We are the men and women that will decide the human destiny.
[01:09.360 --> 01:12.880]  Will the Tim Cooks and other tyrants of the planet enslave us?
[01:12.880 --> 01:17.640]  Are we crap like they think we are or will we transcend their attempt at massive social
[01:17.640 --> 01:23.680]  conditioning and human depopulation on terra firma?
[01:23.680 --> 01:31.440]  We have massive breaking news for you, ladies and gentlemen, and we knew that this was coming
[01:31.440 --> 01:38.120]  because the Soros Group, the Group C Funds, the Democratic Party, and U.S. Democrat Senators
[01:38.120 --> 01:46.840]  have all called for M4s to be completely shut down in congressional hearings, 100% authoritarianism,
[01:46.840 --> 01:51.160]  the likes of which you saw in Nazi Germany or Communist China today.
[01:51.160 --> 01:54.360]  And stuff like this happens in Venezuela, it's big national news here.
[01:54.360 --> 01:58.400]  Well, the Democrats do it, it's part of the course.
[01:58.400 --> 02:02.600]  You've got Governor Jerry Brown saying they need to basically kill the president.
[02:02.600 --> 02:07.240]  You've got Maxine Waters a few days ago, he played the clip saying it's time to knock
[02:07.240 --> 02:08.240]  him off.
[02:08.240 --> 02:12.520]  It means kill somebody, that's the definition of knocking somebody off.
[02:12.520 --> 02:17.560]  It's first definition in Webster means to kill.
[02:17.560 --> 02:22.480]  So they are heating up and realize that our champion Trump is in the front lines battling
[02:22.480 --> 02:23.800]  as hard as he can.
[02:23.800 --> 02:28.880]  In fact, I went through all 200 articles with the one I don't have is the one about Trump
[02:28.880 --> 02:29.880]  rescinds.
[02:29.880 --> 02:36.320]  If I could have that, please, the declassification of the fake Russiagate documents.
[02:36.320 --> 02:38.920]  He didn't actually really do that.
[02:38.920 --> 02:40.760]  It's posted on inforwars.com.
[02:40.760 --> 02:46.080]  What he said was like the JFK documents, he said release them and they said, okay, we
[02:46.080 --> 02:47.200]  want to redact a few areas.
[02:47.200 --> 02:51.720]  He said, fine, he went and had the inspector general check it, the same things happening
[02:51.720 --> 02:52.720]  yet again.
[02:52.720 --> 02:55.680]  But we need to get these out way before the election.
[02:55.680 --> 02:58.680]  These are bombshell between Comey and the rest of them.
[02:58.680 --> 02:59.680]  There it is.
[02:59.680 --> 03:03.240]  Trump walks back his plan to declassify Russia probe documents.
[03:03.240 --> 03:05.960]  That's the same headline RT has.
[03:05.960 --> 03:09.560]  You know, RT is getting worse and worse and worse.
[03:09.560 --> 03:11.000]  Pull up the RT headline.
[03:11.000 --> 03:14.320]  It's the same stupid headline.
[03:14.320 --> 03:17.800]  The RT's mainstream media, especially RT America.
[03:17.800 --> 03:23.160]  Now, obviously the big news here, PayPal.
[03:23.160 --> 03:28.960]  We got a call from our PayPal rep that we've been with PayPal 20 years and millions of
[03:28.960 --> 03:31.200]  dollars a year goes through there.
[03:31.200 --> 03:36.680]  And they tried to get us to a meeting a few weeks ago and wanted all of our other processes
[03:36.680 --> 03:39.480]  and all our other companies are financial data.
[03:39.480 --> 03:41.920]  And I told Tim, I said, don't go to that.
[03:41.920 --> 03:43.440]  I said, they're getting ready to ban us.
[03:43.440 --> 03:47.080]  I see right wing watch and the people from American Way and Soros calling for it to be
[03:47.080 --> 03:48.080]  shut down.
[03:48.080 --> 03:52.360]  They want a blueprint to try to harass everybody in my opinion.
[03:52.360 --> 03:55.800]  And sure enough, he got the call yesterday from one of the reps saying, oh, we need to
[03:55.800 --> 03:58.840]  talk to you tomorrow in a big meeting to let you know what's going to happen.
[03:58.840 --> 04:00.520]  And he said, oh, you're going to ban us.
[04:00.520 --> 04:01.840]  And they said, well, how do you know?
[04:01.840 --> 04:04.000]  He goes, you better get your boss on the line.
[04:04.000 --> 04:06.280]  So we got a senior person on.
[04:06.280 --> 04:07.720]  We recorded them as well.
[04:07.720 --> 04:08.720]  Tim did.
[04:08.720 --> 04:12.440]  I may release the audio with the transcripts and article and infowars.com.
[04:12.440 --> 04:16.400]  And what they're doing now is giving a story to all the mainstream corporate media.
[04:16.400 --> 04:19.880]  And then they can release it at, I'd say, seven o'clock tonight.
[04:19.880 --> 04:25.640]  That's the formula like when Apple banned our number one app, number one on News, a couple
[04:25.640 --> 04:28.480]  million downloads since it came out two months ago.
[04:28.480 --> 04:31.080]  When they banned you being able to download that, you still have it on your phone.
[04:31.080 --> 04:32.080]  It's still there.
[04:32.080 --> 04:35.920]  It was released at seven o'clock on a Friday night.
[04:35.920 --> 04:37.520]  They find it the best time to bury something.
[04:37.520 --> 04:39.880]  So we're getting the jump on them today.
[04:39.880 --> 04:44.240]  Old exclusive PayPal bans, M4s that were lobbying by Soros Funding Group.
[04:44.240 --> 04:48.600]  And I just decided I'm going to upload the five minute phone conversation to the site
[04:48.600 --> 04:49.600]  as well.
[04:49.600 --> 04:50.600]  So you can hear that for yourself.
[04:50.600 --> 04:52.720]  So pretty incredible.
[04:52.720 --> 04:54.440]  It's all coming up straight ahead.
[04:54.440 --> 04:56.520]  This is next level authoritarianism.
[04:56.520 --> 05:00.560]  It's Mark of the Beast denying people from commerce.
[05:00.560 --> 05:04.360]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[05:04.360 --> 05:08.920]  The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates, but a lot of us on the Big Island
[05:08.920 --> 05:14.320]  rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[05:14.320 --> 05:19.720]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles and acid rain could lower the pH of the water
[05:19.720 --> 05:21.240]  to unhealthy levels.
[05:21.240 --> 05:27.800]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity and pH.
[05:27.800 --> 05:31.760]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity
[05:31.760 --> 05:33.040]  in the rainwater.
[05:33.040 --> 05:38.480]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa pure gravity filter and not only were the heavy
[05:38.480 --> 05:44.560]  metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[05:44.560 --> 05:50.200]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa pure raises the pH of the water, so what we've
[05:50.200 --> 05:55.520]  learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[05:55.520 --> 06:11.560]  And more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[06:11.560 --> 06:33.960]  It's Friday, September 21, 2018.
[06:33.960 --> 06:39.480]  I'm your host Alex Jones and I was going to take off today because my 10-year-old daughter
[06:39.480 --> 06:42.280]  particularly wanted me to let her play hooky.
[06:42.280 --> 06:43.960]  She loves it when it's raining outside.
[06:43.960 --> 06:44.960]  It's been raining trenchly.
[06:44.960 --> 06:51.000]  She wanted to go around the green belt with a little hammer.
[06:51.000 --> 06:55.960]  I got her like five years ago for finding fossils, a little geology hammer.
[06:55.960 --> 06:58.520]  She wanted to go dig fossils in the rings.
[06:58.520 --> 07:03.080]  That's a good time to go to the alluvial plain here in Austin, Texas.
[07:03.080 --> 07:08.120]  There's an old extinct volcano we like to go out to and she finds quartz crystals and
[07:08.120 --> 07:09.120]  things like that.
[07:09.120 --> 07:10.120]  They're pretty spectacular fossils.
[07:10.120 --> 07:17.400]  In fact, one of the places we've gone, they've found plesiosars and t-rexes.
[07:17.400 --> 07:18.400]  You name it.
[07:18.400 --> 07:19.400]  So she just loves it.
[07:19.400 --> 07:23.000]  We go out and walk a few miles off into the woods, up to some creeks where nobody ever
[07:23.000 --> 07:27.800]  goes and really finds some neat things, but I'm not here with her.
[07:27.800 --> 07:31.840]  I am in this studio, ladies and gentlemen, so I'm not there with her.
[07:31.840 --> 07:38.440]  I am here for a big reason, a very, very big reason.
[07:38.440 --> 07:42.360]  We have seen the Democratic Party, foreign multinational corporations, the Communist
[07:42.360 --> 07:48.200]  Chinese, George Soros, the famous currency speculator that's brought down over 20 nations,
[07:48.200 --> 07:51.920]  the Hollywood media combine, all trying to destroy me.
[07:51.920 --> 07:59.520]  Build me up as this demon, sue me, attack me, go after all our platforms to silence us
[07:59.520 --> 08:03.800]  to really start the defamation.
[08:03.800 --> 08:11.720]  Instead of the assassination, first they assassinate the character, then they assassinate a little
[08:11.720 --> 08:16.920]  bit more and a little bit more and a little bit more until you basically are dead even
[08:16.920 --> 08:18.960]  though you're still alive.
[08:18.960 --> 08:23.080]  That's how they do it in the 21st century.
[08:23.080 --> 08:28.320]  And so we knew when I was talking to White House sources and campaign sources and others,
[08:28.320 --> 08:31.600]  and you heard Mike Cernovich on here a few months ago when they first banned me, he said,
[08:31.600 --> 08:36.120]  listen, the big thing they're gonna go after is PayPal and credit card processors harassing
[08:36.120 --> 08:37.120]  them.
[08:37.120 --> 08:41.320]  And that's the group that Van Jones still heads up in a U.S. government office that
[08:41.320 --> 08:44.880]  Trump hasn't even gotten rid of yet because there's such a mutiny against Trump, he can't
[08:44.880 --> 08:46.840]  even get hardly anything done.
[08:46.840 --> 08:50.920]  Despite that, he turned the wheel a few degrees and things have gotten much, much better right
[08:50.920 --> 08:51.920]  away.
[08:51.920 --> 08:57.920]  So the final thing that a tyrant does, whether you're Adolf Hitler or whether you're Joseph
[08:57.920 --> 09:02.240]  Stalin or whether you're VI Lenin or whether you're Mao Zedong or whether you're Pol Pot
[09:02.240 --> 09:07.280]  or whether you are Fidel Castro or whether you're Hugo Chavez or whether you are Julius
[09:07.280 --> 09:13.840]  Caesar, is you have money that only you stamp an issue and then you can actually ban certain
[09:13.840 --> 09:19.480]  people through licensure from being able to even engage in commerce.
[09:19.480 --> 09:24.760]  And so America was founded about getting away from, if you weren't a British Lord, you couldn't
[09:24.760 --> 09:25.760]  be in business.
[09:25.760 --> 09:33.520]  Well, America was really founded over business and over the fact that better men weren't allowed
[09:33.520 --> 09:40.840]  to set up shop or have a factory or any other service you can imagine if they weren't working
[09:40.840 --> 09:45.160]  under some inbred, mentally retarded British Lord.
[09:45.160 --> 09:50.760]  And so people were really sick of that royal licensure situation.
[09:50.760 --> 09:55.760]  But if you actually read the writings of our founders, that was why.
[09:55.760 --> 09:56.760]  That's why we had the war.
[09:56.760 --> 09:58.920]  Wasn't over a t-tax.
[09:58.920 --> 10:07.200]  So it's happening again and Hitler first grabbed political groups he didn't like, Jews and
[10:07.200 --> 10:11.480]  many others and put them in ghettos and said, you're not allowed to engage in commerce.
[10:11.480 --> 10:15.320]  First they demonized groups, then they started cutting off their banking, then their commerce,
[10:15.320 --> 10:16.320]  then their shops.
[10:16.320 --> 10:21.600]  Right, it was about crystal knot, all the rest of it, and that's been done by the Communist
[10:21.600 --> 10:22.600]  in Russia.
[10:22.600 --> 10:24.240]  It was done by the Maoist in China.
[10:24.240 --> 10:27.960]  This is an exact formulae.
[10:27.960 --> 10:35.920]  You would have the big oil companies and the big robber baron railroads in famous cases
[10:35.920 --> 10:42.840]  in Colorado and the Dakotas and California, where you'd have towns of 300, 400, 500 people
[10:42.840 --> 10:47.520]  that actually own the land, had the title, but the railroad wanted to come through it
[10:47.520 --> 10:52.240]  and wanted the gold or oil, and they'd sit in Pinkerton security in famous cases and
[10:52.240 --> 10:56.240]  kill hundreds of men, women and children in Colorado, you name it, there's famous cases
[10:56.240 --> 11:01.240]  of Pinkerton massacres in the last century.
[11:01.240 --> 11:07.000]  In the last century, in the 20th century, not the 21st century, 1920s, 30s, you name
[11:07.000 --> 11:12.520]  it, they were still coming into towns and killing everybody, riding toddlers down on
[11:12.520 --> 11:16.860]  horseback just running over babies.
[11:16.860 --> 11:17.860]  That's what they did.
[11:17.860 --> 11:24.020]  They'd pull up with wagons with gatling guns, and just, just kill everybody.
[11:24.020 --> 11:26.560]  So, we've been through this before.
[11:26.560 --> 11:31.420]  All right, this is the same crap, different, you know what?
[11:31.420 --> 11:38.280]  And it's all being done high tech behind this wall of internet largesse by the so-called
[11:38.280 --> 11:41.400]  tech titans and the techies, and they think we're stupid.
[11:41.400 --> 11:46.040]  And because we've pioneered the fact that Google broke its search engine two years ago,
[11:46.040 --> 11:47.040]  we use it constantly.
[11:47.040 --> 11:48.040]  We know.
[11:48.040 --> 11:51.720]  Because we pioneered the Communist Chinese social score coming to America five years
[11:51.720 --> 11:54.500]  ago, three years before anybody else reported on it.
[11:54.500 --> 12:00.440]  Because in thousands of cases, we break the story first that Google filed a patent 20 years
[12:00.440 --> 12:03.520]  ago to start watching and listening to you over computers.
[12:03.520 --> 12:08.080]  Or that Samsung filed a patent 10 years ago and told users six years ago.
[12:08.080 --> 12:12.720]  They know we know what we're doing.
[12:12.720 --> 12:14.360]  So they want us shut down.
[12:14.360 --> 12:18.560]  They want us silenced in a big, big way.
[12:18.560 --> 12:19.560]  And so it happened.
[12:19.560 --> 12:23.240]  And at the bottom of the hour, I'm going to read this entire Paul Joseph Watson article
[12:23.240 --> 12:28.520]  that I also contributed to, Bombshell PayPal Bands Info Wars for Lobbying by Soros Funded
[12:28.520 --> 12:31.220]  Group.
[12:31.220 --> 12:34.360]  And Bezos Lobby, to the Washington Post, have a shutdown.
[12:34.360 --> 12:40.080]  Act, porches interference, interfering in business, racketeering, you name it, to have
[12:40.080 --> 12:43.960]  Amazon, the biggest retailer in the world, through the Washington Post article after
[12:43.960 --> 12:47.720]  article, calling for me to be shut down in my shopping cart to be shut down.
[12:47.720 --> 12:52.120]  That is incredibly criminal.
[12:52.120 --> 12:55.120]  But that's Jeff Bezos.
[12:55.120 --> 12:56.400]  So that's where this is all going.
[12:56.400 --> 12:57.560]  And I've talked to all the law firms.
[12:57.560 --> 13:00.480]  We 1 million percent have winning lawsuits here.
[13:00.480 --> 13:02.480]  It'll take years to win.
[13:02.480 --> 13:06.840]  By then, it'll all be sewed up and we'll be under an authoritarian regime.
[13:06.840 --> 13:10.320]  Again, there we are months ago pointing out Google search engines broken.
[13:10.320 --> 13:16.280]  If you're looking on TV, real.video, our YouTube video was related to that.
[13:16.280 --> 13:19.280]  And we break every bit of it down for you.
[13:19.280 --> 13:20.280]  We prove it all.
[13:20.280 --> 13:21.880]  And now that term's everywhere.
[13:21.880 --> 13:22.880]  Google is broken.
[13:22.880 --> 13:28.600]  Whether you do a search engine about bad reactions from measles shots or you want the drug insert
[13:28.600 --> 13:33.160]  for the new meningitis shot where the own insert says it kills about 1% of people that
[13:33.160 --> 13:38.000]  take it and sterilizes people.
[13:38.000 --> 13:39.000]  That doesn't come up now.
[13:39.000 --> 13:40.840]  PR and BS comes up.
[13:40.840 --> 13:43.160]  So it's not broken.
[13:43.160 --> 13:45.160]  It's a giant fraud.
[13:45.160 --> 13:49.360]  What you do is you internally advertise if you're a Fortune 500 company with Google and
[13:49.360 --> 13:53.160]  all they do is put your search results on top, not as an ad at the top.
[13:53.160 --> 13:55.960]  All the search results, hundreds of pages of it.
[13:55.960 --> 13:56.960]  That's coming out.
[13:56.960 --> 14:03.120]  We're going to be playing, dealing with all of that.
[14:03.120 --> 14:06.320]  So they're making their move into commerce now to block us.
[14:06.320 --> 14:13.720]  Now, here's the thing, PayPal told us that we have 10 days to get off their platform
[14:13.720 --> 14:14.720]  entirely.
[14:14.720 --> 14:16.600]  They've already taken our ability to advertise on Google.
[14:16.600 --> 14:18.520]  They've already taken us off AdRoll.
[14:18.520 --> 14:20.680]  They've already taken us off Credio.
[14:20.680 --> 14:25.880]  They've already are going after all our other systems and people go, oh, it's a free country
[14:25.880 --> 14:26.920]  with their corporations.
[14:26.920 --> 14:29.760]  The Democrats are directing it.
[14:29.760 --> 14:33.840]  They're working with these leftist attack dog groups that are foreign funded and Soros
[14:33.840 --> 14:37.640]  funded and this is just criminal bullying that's going on.
[14:37.640 --> 14:42.800]  It's totally on its face, racketeering, not just a monopoly, but government involved with
[14:42.800 --> 14:44.520]  the monopolies to do this.
[14:44.520 --> 14:48.600]  And Congress and the president must and will be acting very, very soon.
[14:48.600 --> 14:51.560]  But talking to White House sources and others, they said, Alex, your problem is not going
[14:51.560 --> 14:53.520]  to be being banned off these platforms.
[14:53.520 --> 14:57.760]  They're coming after the NRA, everybody's able to process money.
[14:57.760 --> 15:00.200]  And they said they're going to even do it to average conservatives.
[15:00.200 --> 15:04.400]  That's the word from the Democrats, a reign of terror if they get into office.
[15:04.400 --> 15:09.080]  So if they ever get control of the House or the Senate or the presidency, they're going
[15:09.080 --> 15:11.280]  pure authoritarian.
[15:11.280 --> 15:13.200]  The good news is the White House knows that.
[15:13.200 --> 15:17.040]  But as a little protest, I think a lot of people should delete PayPal.
[15:17.040 --> 15:21.720]  They're famous for keeping your money of your emergent and scams.
[15:21.720 --> 15:26.480]  Or you can dump out of your PayPal wallet before you delete it at infowarstore.com to
[15:26.480 --> 15:31.040]  get a water filter, an air filter to get great t-shirts, books, films, our great supplements.
[15:31.040 --> 15:35.560]  Go make a huge purchase to let us get a good signal that you want us to go forward against
[15:35.560 --> 15:36.560]  this.
[15:36.560 --> 15:37.560]  We're not going to back down.
[15:37.560 --> 15:39.280]  I'm going to fight, keep swinging to the end.
[15:39.280 --> 15:40.280]  It looks like we're going to win.
[15:40.280 --> 15:43.680]  Now, they had that big article this week, Alex Jones is winning the Info War.
[15:43.680 --> 15:45.880]  That really pissed him off, showing our numbers are way up.
[15:45.880 --> 15:49.280]  Well, actually you're winning the Info War by standing up these bullets, but now is
[15:49.280 --> 15:50.280]  the big test.
[15:50.280 --> 15:55.760]  Alright, there's a lot of other news coming up as well, but this is next level, folks.

[03:39.540 --> 20:41.400]  all I can say is Trump is on fire, ladies and gentlemen, we're gonna be getting
[20:41.400 --> 20:45.200]  more into the fact that the media spinning it that he is not going to release the secret
[20:45.200 --> 20:51.040]  documents of the FBI, deputy director and Comey and others trying to set the presidency
[20:51.040 --> 20:53.800]  up and trying to derail the candidacy as well.
[20:53.800 --> 20:58.120]  Now he's going to release it, he's allowing a review by the inspector general, he's been
[20:58.120 --> 21:04.360]  a lot more trustworthy than the attorney general, making sure there's no classified information
[21:04.360 --> 21:10.760]  that hurts any innocent people but does expose the crooks that are involved.
[21:10.760 --> 21:18.160]  But getting back to this bombshell information and it is bombshell, the Democrats are seeking
[21:18.160 --> 21:22.800]  to go after individuals right to commerce and jobs.
[21:22.800 --> 21:27.920]  They call it a global communist Chinese social score where everything you do political or
[21:27.920 --> 21:33.160]  in life is put into a database by the big tech giants and by government and then they
[21:33.160 --> 21:40.520]  start restricting your access to fly on planes, to travel, to buy, to sell, this is the plan.
[21:40.520 --> 21:45.440]  In fact, Google and Apple and Facebook in the last month have announced they're going
[21:45.440 --> 21:53.360]  to have trust scores for people that use Google, Facebook or Apple.
[21:53.360 --> 21:58.720]  Remember the Nazis were bad for putting pink triangles on people and stars of David's on
[21:58.720 --> 22:05.080]  others, this is a total control system.
[22:05.080 --> 22:12.480]  So here's some of the headlines on this front that just tie into this bombshell PayPal bans
[22:12.480 --> 22:18.840]  info wars after lobbying by Soros funded group, that's the big article on info wars.com that's
[22:18.840 --> 22:21.120]  so critical to get out.
[22:21.120 --> 22:24.400]  Here's another one, the end finally comes for Alex Jones, the Atlantic Monthly, that's
[22:24.400 --> 22:30.920]  the left CIA, big tech censors Alex Jones, what's next, ban the app and then it goes
[22:30.920 --> 22:36.320]  into Alex Jones' service by PayPal despite obvious terms of service violations and they
[22:36.320 --> 22:40.280]  told us over the phone, they said, does it matter that what you're saying politically
[22:40.280 --> 22:45.160]  that we call hate speech subjectively on your news websites, isn't on your shopping cart,
[22:45.160 --> 22:52.520]  we're banning this because of who you are, unbelievable discrimination beyond not letting
[22:52.520 --> 22:55.920]  people eat at lunch counters because the color of their skin, which was terrible.
[22:55.920 --> 23:02.560]  They're saying I have access to no digital lunch counters and then it goes on, Alex
[23:02.560 --> 23:05.720]  Jones rails against big tech, his info were stores still thrive.
[23:05.720 --> 23:10.480]  That's the Washington Post on my Jeff Bezos calling for me to be shut down just a few
[23:10.480 --> 23:13.360]  weeks ago and now it's happened.
[23:13.360 --> 23:19.960]  Oh, look, George Soros stock up on PayPal stocks.
[23:19.960 --> 23:25.120]  PayPal confirms that it's buying payments and startup iZettle for $2.2 billion in all cash
[23:25.120 --> 23:26.120]  deal.
[23:26.120 --> 23:29.360]  I think the president should block that for antitrust purposes because now they're going
[23:29.360 --> 23:35.240]  to have with Soros a global manipulation into all these major markets and be able to sit
[23:35.240 --> 23:40.840]  there and censor other people and other nations need to block the PayPal iZettle deal.
[23:40.840 --> 23:43.240]  Everyone needs to call Congress.
[23:43.240 --> 23:48.680]  Then you read this, a new color of censorship from the SPLC American greatness.
[23:48.680 --> 23:54.400]  There's still this office of diversity still running the government by Van Jones.
[23:54.400 --> 24:00.120]  They then came out and called David Horowitz this year a Nazi, actually say white supremacists.
[24:00.120 --> 24:06.040]  He's a Israel first Jew, blood money, color of change, smear campaign seeks to shut down
[24:06.040 --> 24:10.680]  the fundraising abilities of conservative organizations by pressuring credit card companies and payment
[24:10.680 --> 24:15.200]  processors and I access the conservative groups, black listed by the Southern Poverty
[24:15.200 --> 24:20.180]  Law Center, color of change, falsely accused all these groups of promoting violence and
[24:20.180 --> 24:22.520]  white supremacy.
[24:22.520 --> 24:29.120]  They had to then remove the ban against Horowitz because calling the American Jew a Nazi didn't
[24:29.120 --> 24:32.040]  fly too well.
[24:32.040 --> 24:35.840]  WikiLeaks Icelandic court battle against Visa for blocking donations.
[24:35.840 --> 24:37.400]  They won.
[24:37.400 --> 24:43.080]  Operation payback was a huge response, taking down Visa and MasterCard for blocking a signs.
[24:43.080 --> 24:46.560]  I'm not calling for the hacking community to do that.
[24:46.560 --> 24:49.960]  I'm simply saying this.
[24:49.960 --> 24:53.160]  I have stood up for WikiLeaks and to believe in what they've done, even if I disagree and
[24:53.160 --> 24:57.560]  I believe in their free speech and I believe in the power of the press to get secret documents
[24:57.560 --> 25:01.840]  and to cover them and I think WikiLeaks has been very judicious about not releasing things
[25:01.840 --> 25:06.560]  that hurt sovereign nations or individuals but expose criminal activity.
[25:06.560 --> 25:09.120]  They have built a strong man against me, the globalist have.
[25:09.120 --> 25:11.320]  They have demonized and assassinated my character.
[25:11.320 --> 25:17.360]  Now they're assassinating our ability to even respond back on hundreds of platforms that
[25:17.360 --> 25:22.280]  we've been banned from, 30 plus major tech platforms and they are now moving in for the
[25:22.280 --> 25:30.000]  kill to cut us off from even receiving money from people that buy high quality products
[25:30.000 --> 25:31.000]  at m4store.com.
[25:31.000 --> 25:33.520]  So I'm asking for WikiLeaks.
[25:33.520 --> 25:36.740]  I'm asking for the people that support WikiLeaks help.
[25:36.740 --> 25:41.520]  When I had the petition that we sent to Trump to pardon Assange, I was told by high level
[25:41.520 --> 25:45.960]  sources that was part of the calculus that went into having me de-platformed six weeks
[25:45.960 --> 25:46.960]  ago.
[25:46.960 --> 25:49.920]  Assange is a hero.
[25:49.920 --> 25:53.560]  So I defend Assange even though they built strong men about him that aren't true.
[25:53.560 --> 25:55.440]  They built strong men about me that aren't true.
[25:55.440 --> 26:02.440]  I need to be defended now not by just this audience but by all the white-hot hackers
[26:02.440 --> 26:04.320]  and by everyone else that understands what's happening.
[26:04.320 --> 26:09.120]  I have dutifully stood the test of time and not back down from incredible demonization.
[26:09.120 --> 26:13.560]  The media trying to have my children taken away from me, death threats, all of it.
[26:13.560 --> 26:20.640]  And I'm asking all of you that stand for free speech and for justice, stand with us.
[26:20.640 --> 26:23.000]  And I also ask PayPal to reconsider what they've done.
[26:23.000 --> 26:27.480]  Now let me do this just briefly because here we are under financial attack.
[26:27.480 --> 26:31.320]  We have other systems where you can buy high quality products via creditcard at m4store.com.
[26:31.320 --> 26:36.880]  A lot of people choose to use PayPal and it will be crippling to say the least because
[26:36.880 --> 26:39.000]  a lot of folks only use PayPal.
[26:39.000 --> 26:41.560]  We still have PayPal for 10 days.
[26:41.560 --> 26:46.360]  You can go there and make a substantive purchase of great products you already need as a message
[26:46.360 --> 26:47.360]  to the globalist.
[26:47.360 --> 26:48.360]  You're not going to put up with their garbage.
[26:48.360 --> 26:53.040]  And I'm going to use this as a gauge of how serious you are about me going 110 percent.
[26:53.040 --> 26:57.800]  Because I'm not going to back down but if we see major capital come in, I'll continue
[26:57.800 --> 26:59.880]  our expansion operations.
[26:59.880 --> 27:05.080]  If I don't see that, I don't want to stop expanding but we're going to have to start
[27:05.080 --> 27:09.560]  contracting and that will only hasten blood in the water in our destruction and then that
[27:09.560 --> 27:10.560]  means your destruction.
[27:10.560 --> 27:15.840]  So I need everybody to go to m4store.com and get X2 the last run of the amazing good halogen.
[27:15.840 --> 27:20.120]  Find out about the iodine conspiracy, the halogen conspiracy, the fluoride conspiracy.
[27:20.120 --> 27:23.680]  It's still 25 percent off but it's got to end this weekend.
[27:23.680 --> 27:25.040]  No excuses.
[27:25.040 --> 27:28.800]  Super male vitality, incredible.
[27:28.800 --> 27:35.080]  And super female vitality, compounded, cold pressed, concentrated herbs, then aged in
[27:35.080 --> 27:38.400]  a proprietary process, thousands of five star reviews.
[27:38.400 --> 27:42.360]  It's 50 percent off and it's our last run too.
[27:42.360 --> 27:45.960]  Because here's the thing, these are super high quality formulas and the price, it costs
[27:45.960 --> 27:51.480]  us a lot and in the position we're in, we can't even sit there and pay the prices for
[27:51.480 --> 27:54.760]  these anymore and that's the point we've gotten down to and the enemy knows that.
[27:54.760 --> 27:55.840]  They've got us under surveillance.
[27:55.840 --> 28:01.680]  So if you want super male vitality, if you want X2, now is the time m4store.com, m4slife.com
[28:01.680 --> 28:05.880]  or triple-A 253-3139 and we're here asking for your help.
[28:05.880 --> 28:06.880]  We appreciate you.
[28:06.880 --> 28:07.880]  We honor you.
[28:07.880 --> 28:10.840]  We appreciate everything you've done already.
[28:10.840 --> 28:13.720]  But this really is epic history taking place.
[28:13.720 --> 28:15.600]  We really have changed the world with your help.
[28:15.600 --> 28:17.760]  We really have relaunched Americana.
[28:17.760 --> 28:20.000]  We really have exposed the global government.
[28:20.000 --> 28:24.440]  It really is on the run worldwide but still has the power and the infrastructure and the
[28:24.440 --> 28:26.320]  beast system.
[28:26.320 --> 28:30.480]  And if you will financially stand with us, it will do incredible things.
[28:30.480 --> 28:35.600]  But I need to see a major move at m4store.com, t-shirts, books, films, sign up for auto
[28:35.600 --> 28:38.120]  ship, get an additional 10% off.
[28:38.120 --> 28:40.440]  It's all there and why you still can use PayPal.
[28:40.440 --> 28:46.520]  Dump out that PayPal wallet at m4store.com as a strong message and then cancel it.
[28:46.520 --> 28:50.800]  They've backed off before but this isn't just kicking somebody off YouTube or Facebook.
[28:50.800 --> 28:53.480]  This is saying you've been with us 20 years.
[28:53.480 --> 28:56.120]  You've done tens of millions of dollars in business through our thing and now we're
[28:56.120 --> 28:59.200]  going to shut you down because Soros bought our company.
[28:59.200 --> 29:03.480]  Hunters, anglers, campers and survivalists, get back to nature.
[29:03.480 --> 29:08.000]  Your horizons with the highest quality, most versatile, unique sling shots and sling bows
[29:08.000 --> 29:10.600]  on the market at slingbow.com.

[31:00.320 --> 31:05.280]  X2, we were selling it for about three years, and then they found out how big it was and
[31:05.280 --> 31:08.640]  how much we were buying, and they said, oh, we want more money, more money, and oh, this
[31:08.640 --> 31:09.640]  and that.
[31:09.640 --> 31:14.440]  And so I've broken my contract, and right now we can't get more of this proprietary
[31:14.440 --> 31:18.200]  ingredient that goes in X2 that literally is so pure that if you put it in a peaker
[31:18.200 --> 31:23.480]  dish on top of 90 degree hot plate, it gasses, like I dream of genie in this, it's purple
[31:23.480 --> 31:24.480]  gas.
[31:24.480 --> 31:27.280]  I mean, that is so pure, it just goes right into your body when you take it.
[31:27.280 --> 31:32.760]  We're working on trying to get other suppliers right now, but I bought a huge amount of it,
[31:32.760 --> 31:36.680]  ordered it six months ago, so I get the price down, and I said, if you don't lower it, I'm
[31:36.680 --> 31:40.200]  done, I'm breaking the contract, but I broke the contract last week.
[31:40.200 --> 31:44.440]  And so this is potentially the last run, in fact, right now it is the last run, which
[31:44.440 --> 31:49.000]  is Bible Shield X2, and we've got a good supply of it, but it'll be gone in a couple
[31:49.000 --> 31:50.000]  months.
[31:50.000 --> 31:54.600]  X2, if you haven't experienced it, infowarstore.com, if you have experienced it, I suggest you

[33:39.160 --> 33:42.040]  Don't dance in darkness.
[33:42.040 --> 33:47.460]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are broadcasting worldwide.
[33:47.460 --> 33:48.960]  We are the Infowar.
[33:48.960 --> 33:56.720]  And I'm quite cheerful, to be under massive persecution by the devil-worshipping, child-molesting,
[33:56.720 --> 34:00.760]  communist-loving, God-hating New World Order.
[34:00.760 --> 34:03.920]  Because when they're done, their whole world government's going to come crashing down,
[34:03.920 --> 34:12.320]  and they're going to be crowned from the Communist Chinese, and Tim Cook, and Apple, King, nothing!
[34:12.320 --> 34:15.760]  All right.
[34:15.760 --> 34:21.680]  We've got so much coming up next hour, the latest on Cabinon, the just insane stuff
[34:21.680 --> 34:26.000]  going on, that we're going to be breaking down in great detail.
[34:26.000 --> 34:30.840]  But first off, let's get into the central situation that's happening.
[34:30.840 --> 34:37.360]  The move to take the NRA, and every other gun shop, and every other hunting supply shop,
[34:37.360 --> 34:42.000]  right to have a bank account or process credit cards.
[34:42.000 --> 34:49.440]  It's Mark of the Beast, Isle of Patmos, John the Revelator, if you don't even believe
[34:49.440 --> 34:55.520]  in God, the point is, imagine what Hitler would have done with the casual society.
[34:55.520 --> 34:59.680]  And so, Google and Facebook, now once you're banking info to be on Facebook, and they want
[34:59.680 --> 35:03.920]  to tie it all in this big race, and they want you to put little spies in your home, like
[35:03.920 --> 35:11.840]  Alexa and, you know, the Google Home Assistant, and I see TV ads where the wife's gone and
[35:11.840 --> 35:12.840]  the husband's there.
[35:12.840 --> 35:17.000]  But the little Google Assistant tells the husband he's good in a woman's voice.
[35:17.000 --> 35:19.640]  This is so sick.
[35:19.640 --> 35:24.000]  These are big, ruthless corporations that we've trusted with everything.
[35:24.000 --> 35:30.360]  And I've got stacks of news just today, where they're taking advantage of that.
[35:30.360 --> 35:32.680]  Like Zuckerberg said, our users trust us.
[35:32.680 --> 35:34.800]  What dumb efforts.
[35:34.800 --> 35:38.440]  Google employees corrupted their own search engine to propagandize the millions.
[35:38.440 --> 35:41.040]  We're going to play that clip from Tucker Carlson coming up.
[35:41.040 --> 35:44.040]  I know you heard this a long time ago here, but now it's coming out.
[35:44.040 --> 35:47.520]  Google workers discussed tweaking search function to counter travel ban.
[35:47.520 --> 35:49.840]  Yeah, don't criticize radical Islam.
[35:49.840 --> 35:53.520]  Apple gives you a trust rating based on your phone call and email habits.
[35:53.520 --> 35:55.800]  Oh, Tim Cook's tracking everything you do.
[35:55.800 --> 35:58.200]  Now, don't track what he does.
[35:58.200 --> 36:00.000]  He supports Communist China.
[36:00.000 --> 36:02.800]  Google admits it still allows apps to access your Gmail.
[36:02.800 --> 36:03.800]  That's right.
[36:03.800 --> 36:04.800]  Why not?
[36:04.800 --> 36:07.460]  They even refuse to testify to Congress.
[36:07.460 --> 36:13.000]  They do whatever they want, whenever they want, because they think you're an idiot.
[36:13.000 --> 36:16.920]  But then there's a talk show host talking about all this and warning people and warning
[36:16.920 --> 36:18.480]  the president.
[36:18.480 --> 36:21.280]  We got to kick him off all these platforms where he's popular.
[36:21.280 --> 36:23.320]  We got to defame him and lie about him.
[36:23.320 --> 36:26.320]  And then we've got to completely remove him from the internet period, and then we can't
[36:26.320 --> 36:30.840]  let him even sell books or videos or supplements.
[36:30.840 --> 36:32.880]  We have to fully shut him down.
[36:32.880 --> 36:37.280]  And then of course, once they're able to do that, what do you think happens after that
[36:37.280 --> 36:38.280]  point?
[36:38.280 --> 36:39.280]  Everyone else?
[36:39.280 --> 36:41.040]  In fact, can you guys put behind me?
[36:41.040 --> 36:43.240]  I wanted to do this.
[36:43.240 --> 36:49.760]  It's the new Americans' current cover of their magazine, Alex Jones Censored.
[36:49.760 --> 36:51.840]  And it says, first, Alex Jones was censored.
[36:51.840 --> 36:52.840]  Who's next?
[36:52.840 --> 36:56.400]  It's a pretty powerful cover.
[36:56.400 --> 36:58.120]  I think Marley tweeted it out last night.
[36:58.120 --> 37:02.040]  I meant to tell you guys, start of the show, maybe next segment, we'll have that and put
[37:02.040 --> 37:03.040]  it behind me.
[37:03.040 --> 37:10.440]  But right now, let's go ahead and go into this bombshell, PayPal bans info wars after
[37:10.440 --> 37:18.720]  lobbying by Soros funded group, the Democrats and more payment processor terminates agreements
[37:18.720 --> 37:25.360]  citing hate and intolerance, a perfectly nebulous subjective term.
[37:25.360 --> 37:29.560]  You think teaching five year olds, they're another sex and trying to put them on sterilization
[37:29.560 --> 37:30.560]  drugs is hateful.
[37:30.560 --> 37:31.560]  You're banned.
[37:31.560 --> 37:34.960]  The Islam throwing gave people off buildings and the government supporting it's wrong.
[37:34.960 --> 37:35.960]  You're banned.
[37:35.960 --> 37:39.840]  You think you should have your own first amendment, you're banned.
[37:39.840 --> 37:44.880]  Payment processor PayPal has banned info wars and what represents nothing less than a political
[37:44.880 --> 37:50.040]  ploy designed to financially sabotage and influential media outlet just weeks ahead
[37:50.040 --> 37:53.200]  of the midterm elections.
[37:53.200 --> 37:56.760]  Company representatives called info wars our city confirmed that PayPal was terminating
[37:56.760 --> 38:01.760]  its agreement after a comprehensive review of the info wars site, which is not even the
[38:01.760 --> 38:02.760]  shopping cart.
[38:02.760 --> 38:08.000]  The company claim that info wars violated PayPal's acceptable use policy because it
[38:08.000 --> 38:12.360]  promoted hate and discriminatory intolerance in certain communities and religions.
[38:12.360 --> 38:19.040]  No specific examples whatsoever were officially provided to back up the claim, which relies
[38:19.040 --> 38:24.440]  on the nebulous definition of hate, which is so vague that it virtually anything could
[38:24.440 --> 38:25.440]  qualify.
[38:25.440 --> 38:27.680]  And the one thing I asked Paul, they had the article he did and we're going to do another
[38:27.680 --> 38:28.680]  article.
[38:28.680 --> 38:31.160]  Maybe I've kept Daniels or Don do it or somebody else.
[38:31.160 --> 38:34.600]  I don't want Lucifer kind of be taken off or nation of Islam.
[38:34.600 --> 38:37.560]  I don't even want the Palestinians to be taken off the Muslim brotherhood.
[38:37.560 --> 38:40.160]  That's a terror group or care.
[38:40.160 --> 38:41.920]  They've all got their PayPal.
[38:41.920 --> 38:43.520]  They've all got their Facebook and YouTube.
[38:43.520 --> 38:44.520]  I don't.
[38:44.520 --> 38:50.200]  And these are groups, you know, saying Jews are the devil and things that I don't agree
[38:50.200 --> 38:52.120]  with, but they have a right to say it.
[38:52.120 --> 38:58.240]  Homosexuality is punishable by death and all those other stuff, but I'm not saying that
[38:58.240 --> 38:59.240]  I'm banned.
[38:59.240 --> 39:02.960]  They're not because there's an open door to Islam in this larger globalist plan.
[39:02.960 --> 39:07.920]  So we need to have a whole other article about PayPal bans Jones for hate won't just define
[39:07.920 --> 39:13.920]  it, but then leaves groups funding terrorist up off records.
[39:13.920 --> 39:18.720]  Info wars was told that criticism of Islam and opposition to transgenderism being taught
[39:18.720 --> 39:23.000]  that children in school were the two examples of hate.
[39:23.000 --> 39:29.760]  The man was instituted that despite info wars store.com containing no political content
[39:29.760 --> 39:34.920]  whatsoever, emphasizing how the decision was a broader attack on info wars platform.
[39:34.920 --> 39:38.440]  And they admit that you're being shut down because of what you do on other websites.
[39:38.440 --> 39:43.600]  PayPal represents said they were given info wars, 10 days to switch payment processors
[39:43.600 --> 39:46.480]  after which all services would be terminated.
[39:46.480 --> 39:50.640]  The ban was handed down just weeks after George Soros funded group right wing watch.
[39:50.640 --> 39:56.520]  By the way, George Soros has bought controlling interest in PayPal, I should tell you.
[39:56.520 --> 39:58.640]  So it's now Soros, pal.
[39:58.640 --> 39:59.640]  That's right.
[39:59.640 --> 40:01.400]  If you have a PayPal account, you are now Soros, pal.
[40:01.400 --> 40:05.240]  The ban was handed down just weeks after George Soros funded group right wing watch published
[40:05.240 --> 40:10.520]  an article demanding the PayPal terminated agreement with info wars for egregious violations,
[40:10.520 --> 40:14.400]  the platform's own terms of service.
[40:14.400 --> 40:20.920]  The gang of leftist Soros funded Nazi collaborator thugs come down the street saying we're going
[40:20.920 --> 40:25.120]  to burn you down politically if you don't ban him and they just put their head between
[40:25.120 --> 40:28.160]  their legs and kiss their ass goodbye.
[40:28.160 --> 40:31.680]  Right wing watch routinely violates copyright by opening entire sections of people's videos
[40:31.680 --> 40:36.360]  on YouTube without any pretense of fair use yet the group's channel has not been deleted
[40:36.360 --> 40:38.000]  because they're the ruling class.
[40:38.000 --> 40:40.960]  Right wing watch is owned by People of the American Way which is funded by George Soros
[40:40.960 --> 40:43.920]  Open Society Institute which is being banned in Europe.
[40:43.920 --> 40:48.720]  In addition, the Jeff Bezos own Washington Post published an article less than two weeks
[40:48.720 --> 40:53.480]  ago that serve as a dog whistle for PayPal to ban info wars.
[40:53.480 --> 40:58.280]  Well, they actually said banning entitled, as Alex Jones ran against big tech, his info
[40:58.280 --> 41:00.840]  wars stores still thrive online.
[41:00.840 --> 41:04.620]  The article bemoaned the fact that despite Alex Jones being taken off every other big
[41:04.620 --> 41:10.640]  tech platform, censorship had left intact key elements of his money making machinery
[41:10.640 --> 41:13.960]  and digital storefronts, gotta blow that up.
[41:13.960 --> 41:18.720]  The article then specifically mentions how info wars uses PayPal to generate a high rate
[41:18.720 --> 41:25.840]  of sales and had CIA funded university professors detailing all the traffic and how to shut
[41:25.840 --> 41:28.040]  it down.
[41:28.040 --> 41:32.440]  And that's Obama and the stay behind network he has in the CIA and the Justice Department.
[41:32.440 --> 41:37.800]  Yet another example of a competing media outlet abusing its dominant position to lobby to shut
[41:37.800 --> 41:42.200]  down a smaller media outlet, PayPal banning info wars is the ultimate culmination of what
[41:42.200 --> 41:48.320]  represents a de facto communist Chinese style social credit score where first you demonize
[41:48.320 --> 41:53.840]  then censor before you basically destroy the ability to operate in the marketplace and
[41:53.840 --> 41:55.360]  starve people to death.
[41:55.360 --> 41:58.960]  Yes, from the gulag to the death camp.
[41:58.960 --> 42:00.200]  We're now in the gulag folks.
[42:00.200 --> 42:06.040]  The decision is also blatantly political given the fact that midterms are just 45 and a half
[42:06.040 --> 42:07.040]  days away.
[42:07.040 --> 42:11.480]  The crusade to ban Alex Jones and info wars from a myriad of other platforms was amplified
[42:11.480 --> 42:15.800]  by Democratic Congressman Ted Deutsch, who demanded we have links to it all to know why
[42:15.800 --> 42:19.720]  Facebook and YouTube hadn't banned Jones, both companies complied with Germany's demand
[42:19.720 --> 42:22.920]  within weeks.
[42:22.920 --> 42:27.440]  See Obama is still in office, according to them along with Hillary and the leader in
[42:27.440 --> 42:29.080]  the government is Senator Warner.
[42:29.080 --> 42:34.440]  So this little creature is just giving orders saying ban him where the government from
[42:34.440 --> 42:39.160]  so legitimate he'll be gone soon and moving forward with this.
[42:39.160 --> 42:43.280]  We'll finish up with this article straight ahead and then play Tucker Carlson, incredible
[42:43.280 --> 42:49.160]  patron that he is exposing the whole thing straight ahead info wars dot com news wars
[42:49.160 --> 42:50.160]  dot com.
[42:50.160 --> 42:52.480]  You realize that we're like the Alamo here.
[42:52.480 --> 42:59.320]  I mean, we're fighting hard, no matter what happens, we went in the end.
[42:59.320 --> 43:00.640]  We knew it was coming.
[43:00.640 --> 43:05.760]  The whole thing was for me like first demonize info wars lie about us, build a straw man
[43:05.760 --> 43:08.520]  then sue us to add credibility to that.
[43:08.520 --> 43:12.920]  Then have a few fake strikes on YouTube and Facebook with nebulous terms like bullying
[43:12.920 --> 43:15.400]  children and Islamophobia.
[43:15.400 --> 43:22.040]  And then walla two weeks later ban info wars completely off of dozens of major platforms

[02:18:50.440 --> 02:18:58.200]  to go big and go home with the Pro Pure Whole House filtration system today. X2, we were selling it for
[02:18:58.200 --> 02:19:02.600]  about three years and then they found out how big it was and how much we were buying, and they said,
[02:19:02.600 --> 02:19:07.560]  oh, we want more money, more money, and oh, this and that. And so I've broken my contract, and right
[02:19:07.560 --> 02:19:13.240]  now we can't get more of this proprietary ingredient that goes in X2 that literally is so pure that
[02:19:13.240 --> 02:19:18.600]  if you put it in a peaker dish on top of 90 degree hot plate, it gasses like I dream of genie and
[02:19:18.600 --> 02:19:22.920]  it is purple gas. I mean, that is so pure, it just goes right into your body when you take it.
[02:19:22.920 --> 02:19:27.560]  We're working on trying to get other suppliers right now, but I bought a huge amount of it,
[02:19:28.280 --> 02:19:32.760]  ordered it six months ago, so I get the price down, and I said, if you don't lower it, I'm done,
[02:19:32.760 --> 02:19:37.480]  I'm breaking the contract. Well, I broke the contract last week, and so this is potentially
[02:19:37.480 --> 02:19:42.840]  the last run. In fact, right now it is the last run, which is Vybel Shield X2, and we've got a
[02:19:42.840 --> 02:19:47.160]  good supply of it. It'll be gone a couple of months. X2, if you haven't experienced it,
[02:19:47.160 --> 02:19:51.720]  infowarstore.com, if you have experienced it, I suggest you stop up on it. It's available
[02:19:51.720 --> 02:20:17.240]  right now for a limited time. Infowars.com is 25% off right now.
[02:20:22.040 --> 02:20:25.400]  This is getting totally out of control, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:20:26.760 --> 02:20:29.960]  Now, before I start going into this New York Times story that just broke
[02:20:29.960 --> 02:20:35.560]  Redlinked and Siren on Drudge headline, Rosenstein suggested he secretly record
[02:20:35.560 --> 02:20:41.640]  Trump and discussed 25th Amendment. I'm going to read this whole article in the next two segments.
[02:20:42.520 --> 02:20:50.120]  Rosenstein has already come out and denied this, so think about that. They can't even figure out
[02:20:50.120 --> 02:20:56.440]  their own coup right now. They're so out of control. They can't even get their coup against America
[02:20:57.080 --> 02:21:00.760]  straight because there's so many different angles and attempts to destroy this country.
[02:21:00.760 --> 02:21:04.120]  But before I go into this article, here's what people need to understand.
[02:21:06.040 --> 02:21:13.400]  This is not a political talk show talking point. This is not some political talk show narrative.
[02:21:13.400 --> 02:21:19.720]  This is not for your entertainment. This is not me coming up with smoke billowing out of my ears
[02:21:19.720 --> 02:21:22.760]  for you to laugh and point and cry and agree or whatever.
[02:21:25.720 --> 02:21:34.120]  This is an unelected group of people inside the government, inside unelected bureaucracies
[02:21:34.680 --> 02:21:40.760]  that are attempting a coup against the president of the United States. But it's not just the
[02:21:40.760 --> 02:21:48.280]  president of the United States. It's against you. They believe they decide this country's fate.
[02:21:48.280 --> 02:21:52.760]  They believe they decide who the president is. They decided it was Hillary Clinton.
[02:21:53.640 --> 02:21:58.600]  We, the people, decided it was Donald Trump. So they decided they were going to remove Donald
[02:21:58.600 --> 02:22:03.960]  Trump and stop us from having any Democratic Republic whatsoever. That's the story here,
[02:22:03.960 --> 02:22:10.360]  folks. That's what needs to sink in. This is beyond Donald Trump. This is about a deep state.
[02:22:10.360 --> 02:22:16.600]  This is about a shadow government. This is about crime at the highest levels, if not bordering on
[02:22:16.600 --> 02:22:24.120]  treason, straight up treason, being committed by a shadow government, a coup against America,
[02:22:24.120 --> 02:22:30.520]  where we elect a president and they say no. We put a Supreme Court justice in via our president and
[02:22:30.520 --> 02:22:38.360]  they say no. Are you going to let a couple elites inside a shadow government that they even admit
[02:22:38.360 --> 02:22:42.520]  now in the New York Times exist? Are you going to let them control your life? Are you going to let
[02:22:42.520 --> 02:22:48.040]  them steal your vote? That's what they're doing, folks. That's what they're doing. They are trying
[02:22:48.040 --> 02:22:56.440]  to steal your vote. And I'm going to tell you something here. They already rigged these elections,
[02:22:56.440 --> 02:23:05.400]  folks. The will of the American people is so against the deep state right now. It's not even close.
[02:23:05.400 --> 02:23:12.520]  If you had a fair election right now, and every single American, almost 330 million,
[02:23:12.520 --> 02:23:21.160]  if you had a real election not rigged, a real election right now, 330 million Americans, 300,
[02:23:21.160 --> 02:23:27.640]  I bet you 250 million Americans would support Trump and support his agenda right now.
[02:23:27.640 --> 02:23:36.680]  But what do you have? 20 to 30 people inside a shadow government and operating from outside,
[02:23:36.680 --> 02:23:44.040]  like Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, trying to dictate this country using their propaganda
[02:23:44.040 --> 02:23:51.000]  wings of television news like CNN, MSNBC, using their propaganda wings of press like Washington
[02:23:51.000 --> 02:23:56.520]  Post and New York Times, using their propaganda wings of entertainment like the NFL and Hollywood,
[02:23:56.520 --> 02:24:03.640]  the NFL and Hollywood to try to act like those 30 people that want to run your life or the minority
[02:24:03.640 --> 02:24:09.960]  when it's a tiny few elite that are trying to destroy this country and destroy our Democratic
[02:24:09.960 --> 02:24:16.200]  Republic. That's what you need to understand. And they use all of their propaganda wings and the
[02:24:16.200 --> 02:24:22.280]  optics to make you think that you're not winning, to make you think that we're not having an American
[02:24:22.280 --> 02:24:26.840]  revolution. We are having such an American revolution right now. It's not even funny and
[02:24:26.840 --> 02:24:31.960]  they're trying to do everything to stop you. They want you, you're basically a slave to these people.
[02:24:31.960 --> 02:24:35.880]  You wouldn't vote for Donald Trump. Don't care. We're going to remove him from office. That's
[02:24:35.880 --> 02:24:39.800]  what they think. Now, let me get into this story from the New York Times. It's Rosenstein has already
[02:24:39.800 --> 02:24:46.440]  denied that he tried to set up the president from Adam Goldman and Michael Schmidt at the New York
[02:24:46.440 --> 02:24:52.600]  Times just published headline. Rosenstein suggested he secretly record Trump and discussed 25th
[02:24:52.600 --> 02:24:58.840]  Amendment. The deputy attorney general Rod J. Rosenstein suggested last year that he secretly
[02:24:58.840 --> 02:25:03.080]  record President Trump in the White House to expose the chaos consuming the administration.
[02:25:03.080 --> 02:25:07.480]  And he discussed recruiting cabinet members to invoke the 25th Amendment to remove Mr.
[02:25:07.480 --> 02:25:13.480]  Trump from office for being unfit, for being unfit. No, that's for existing, for winning.
[02:25:13.480 --> 02:25:18.680]  That's why they had to get him out because he won because we decided the country. We decided
[02:25:18.680 --> 02:25:23.800]  the president. We wanted Trump. We didn't want Hillary Clinton. We decided that. They decided,
[02:25:23.800 --> 02:25:31.160]  no, you don't get Trump. Mr. Rosenstein made these suggestions in the spring of 2017 when
[02:25:31.160 --> 02:25:35.800]  Mr. Trump's firing of James Comey as FBI director plunged the White House into turmoil. Oh, but
[02:25:35.800 --> 02:25:46.040]  who wrote the letter of recommendation to President Trump to fire James Comey? Who was that? Rod Rosenstein.
[02:25:48.760 --> 02:25:53.960]  A self-fulfilling prophecy. You write the letter of recommendation to fire Comey. He fires Comey,
[02:25:53.960 --> 02:26:01.560]  and then you launch an investigation into him firing Comey. That is Rod the Rat Rosenstein.
[02:26:01.560 --> 02:26:07.240]  Over the ensuing days, the president divulged classified intelligence to Russians in the Oval
[02:26:07.240 --> 02:26:13.880]  Office. What is that even talking about? And revelations emerged that Mr. Trump had asked Mr.
[02:26:13.880 --> 02:26:19.640]  Comey to pledge loyalty and end an investigation into a senior aide, which we're about to get the
[02:26:19.640 --> 02:26:28.040]  FISA documents on that, which is why they wrote this story as a soft release to say, oh, well,
[02:26:28.040 --> 02:26:32.040]  yeah, this all happened in the FISA, and they were illegally spying, and they were all behind it,
[02:26:32.040 --> 02:26:36.840]  and Obama was involved, and it was a setup from the beginning. But we did it because we had to
[02:26:36.840 --> 02:26:41.560]  stop Trump who was unfit. We did it because Trump was so uncouth. We did it for America.
[02:26:43.400 --> 02:26:51.240]  Total bull. They did this to defeat America. Mr. Rosenstein was just two weeks into his job. He
[02:26:51.240 --> 02:26:55.560]  had begun overseeing the Russia investigation and played a key role in the president's dismissal
[02:26:55.560 --> 02:27:01.000]  of Mr. Comey by writing a memo critical of his handling of the Hillary Clinton email investigation,
[02:27:01.000 --> 02:27:05.800]  or how about the fact he just shut it down after it came out she was guilty. But Mr.
[02:27:05.800 --> 02:27:10.200]  Rosenstein was caught off guard when Mr. Trump cited the memo in the firing, and he began telling
[02:27:10.200 --> 02:27:18.440]  people that he feared he had been used. This is unbelievable, this propaganda. Mr. Rosenstein
[02:27:18.440 --> 02:27:22.520]  made the remarks about secretly recording Mr. Trump and about the 25th Amendment in meetings
[02:27:22.520 --> 02:27:30.600]  and conversations with other Justice Department and FBI officials. Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Rosenstein's
[02:27:30.600 --> 02:27:38.840]  denying this. Somebody's lying. Several people described the episodes, several, insisting on
[02:27:38.840 --> 02:27:44.200]  anonymity. I can't even pronounce it. To discuss internal deliberations, the people were briefed
[02:27:44.200 --> 02:27:49.560]  either on the events themselves or on memos written by FBI officials, including Andrew McCabe,
[02:27:49.560 --> 02:27:55.080]  disgraced, then the acting bureau director that documented Mr. Rosenstein's actions and comments.
[02:27:55.080 --> 02:28:07.880]  Uh-oh. Oh. Now the deep state faces off against itself. None of Mr. Rosenstein's proposals
[02:28:07.880 --> 02:28:13.960]  apparently came to fruition. It is not clear how determined he was about seeing them through,
[02:28:13.960 --> 02:28:18.200]  though he did tell Mr. McCabe that he might be able to persuade Attorney General Jeff Sessions and
[02:28:18.200 --> 02:28:24.200]  John Kelly. Oh. Then the Secretary of Homeland Security and now the White House Chief of Staff
[02:28:24.200 --> 02:28:34.520]  to mount an effort to invoke the 25th Amendment. Oh. Now we know why people didn't want
[02:28:34.520 --> 02:28:41.080]  Infowars to get on the President's desk. Now we know why Jeff Sessions is doing nothing.
[02:28:41.080 --> 02:28:47.480]  Now we know why people had to stop headlines like President Trump be warned they're coming
[02:28:47.480 --> 02:28:53.080]  at you with the 25th Amendment from getting to his desk. Oh. The deep state becomes a little
[02:28:53.080 --> 02:28:59.400]  clearer now. Hi. I'm Dan Pilla. I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize

[02:33:01.800 --> 02:33:14.920]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the resistance.
[02:33:14.920 --> 02:33:20.440]  And now your host, Owen Troyer. All right, let's get right back into this New York Times article.
[02:33:20.440 --> 02:33:24.200]  I'm going to finish that. And then there's new breaking news coming from Judicial Watch.
[02:33:24.200 --> 02:33:28.360]  And then there's another development with the Kavanaugh situation. But let me go right back
[02:33:28.360 --> 02:33:34.520]  into this story. The extreme suggestions show Mr. Rosenstein's state of mind and the disorienting
[02:33:34.520 --> 02:33:41.160]  days that followed Mr. Comey's dismissal. Disorienting days, extreme suggestions.
[02:33:41.960 --> 02:33:47.000]  Sitting in on Mr. Trump's interviews with prospective FBI directors and facing attacks
[02:33:47.000 --> 02:33:52.120]  for his own role in Mr. Comey's firing, Mr. Rosenstein had an up-close view of the tumult,
[02:33:52.120 --> 02:33:57.640]  the tumult. Yeah, yeah, again. So they're building this whole narrative up. This is them
[02:33:57.640 --> 02:34:01.320]  coming out with the soft release of what we're about to find out in the FISA courts,
[02:34:01.320 --> 02:34:06.760]  acting like the Trump administration is out of control and the Comey's firing was unjustified.
[02:34:06.760 --> 02:34:10.760]  And Rosenstein is just trying to keep everything under control.
[02:34:14.360 --> 02:34:19.560]  Mr. Rosenstein had an up-close view of the tumult. Mr. Rosenstein appeared conflicted,
[02:34:19.560 --> 02:34:22.600]  regretful, and emotional, according to people who spoke with him at the time.
[02:34:22.600 --> 02:34:28.120]  You know, I bet that has something to do with the crimes that these people are trying to cover up
[02:34:28.120 --> 02:34:34.360]  more than anything. Mr. Rosenstein, however, has disputed this account. He says, I quote,
[02:34:34.360 --> 02:34:39.880]  the New York Times story is inaccurate and factually incorrect. I will not further comment
[02:34:39.880 --> 02:34:43.800]  on a story based on anonymous sources who are obviously biased against the department
[02:34:43.800 --> 02:34:47.480]  and are advancing their own personal agenda. But let me be clear about this,
[02:34:47.480 --> 02:34:51.560]  based on my personal dealings with the president, there is no basis to invoke the 25th Amendment.
[02:34:51.560 --> 02:34:59.320]  Oh, talk about cover your ass. So it actually looks like what may have happened here,
[02:35:00.440 --> 02:35:07.480]  as we read on, and it becomes clear, actual patriots inside the FBI and the Department
[02:35:07.480 --> 02:35:15.240]  of Justice are calling out Rosenstein and Sessions and the like for not just a dereliction of duty,
[02:35:15.240 --> 02:35:23.160]  but in effect, a soft coup against the president of the United States and against the American will.
[02:35:24.440 --> 02:35:29.080]  It goes on. Justice Department spokeswoman also provided a statement from a person who
[02:35:29.080 --> 02:35:36.440]  was present when Mr. Rosenstein proposed wearing a wire, going undercover against the president
[02:35:36.440 --> 02:35:40.920]  of the United States, folks. Like, just think about this. They have positioned themselves
[02:35:40.920 --> 02:35:49.240]  against America. Like, they have taken the position against America wearing a wire to
[02:35:49.240 --> 02:35:58.840]  go in and try to set the president up that we elected. The person who would not be named acknowledged
[02:35:58.840 --> 02:36:04.360]  the remark, but said Mr. Rosenstein made it sarcastically. But according to others who
[02:36:04.360 --> 02:36:08.440]  described his comments, Mr. Rosenstein not only confirmed that he was serious about the idea,
[02:36:08.440 --> 02:36:13.160]  but also followed up by suggesting that other FBI officials who were interviewing to be the
[02:36:13.160 --> 02:36:20.760]  bureau's director could also secretly record Mr. Trump. That's treason. You're going to jail.
[02:36:23.880 --> 02:36:28.280]  You know, remember what Hillary Clinton said? It's a good thing. Someone like Trump didn't
[02:36:28.280 --> 02:36:33.800]  get elected. And what did he say? Because you'd be in jail. President Trump. No, no, no. Look,
[02:36:33.800 --> 02:36:40.520]  President Trump needs to hear this. President Trump, they will put a bullet in your head by
[02:36:40.520 --> 02:36:47.320]  the year 2020 if you do not act now against these people. You need to fire up military tribunals.
[02:36:47.320 --> 02:36:51.960]  You need to fire up independent investigations. You need to launch special counsel against
[02:36:51.960 --> 02:36:59.160]  these people or they will kill you just like they did JFK. Believe it. Just like they try to do to
[02:36:59.160 --> 02:37:08.680]  Reagan. Believe it, President. They are on a full bore mission to bring America down. They are on a
[02:37:08.680 --> 02:37:16.200]  full bore mission in a coup against this Republic and your public enemy number one to them, President.
[02:37:16.200 --> 02:37:20.520]  You're standing in their way. If they can't remove you with the 25th Amendment, 25th Amendment,
[02:37:20.520 --> 02:37:26.520]  they'll remove you with death. You have to act now, President. You have to act now.
[02:37:26.520 --> 02:37:35.800]  These people know no limits. They do spirit cookings. They fly to pedophile island.
[02:37:36.520 --> 02:37:41.880]  They lie to try to keep a Supreme Court justice off the Supreme Court. You have to act now.
[02:37:41.880 --> 02:37:48.520]  We need military. The West. Oh, man. Let me just go back to the article.
[02:37:49.880 --> 02:37:54.040]  Mr. McCabe, who was later fired from the FBI, declined to comment. His memos have been turned
[02:37:54.040 --> 02:37:58.520]  over to the special counsel investigating whether Trump associates conspired with Russia's election
[02:37:58.520 --> 02:38:03.480]  interference, Robert S. Mueller, according to a lawyer from McCabe. Oh, great. So the records
[02:38:03.480 --> 02:38:09.000]  of high treason against this country are going to the man who's engaged in high treason against
[02:38:09.000 --> 02:38:16.760]  this country. Great. Yeah, that'll go real far. A set of those memos remained at the FBI at the
[02:38:16.760 --> 02:38:24.840]  time of his departure in late January 2018. Lawyer Michael Bromwich said of his client,
[02:38:24.840 --> 02:38:29.560]  he has no knowledge of how any member of the media obtained those memos. Oh, you mean the
[02:38:29.560 --> 02:38:34.360]  deep state leaks? Wow, shocking. Oh, to the New York Times even? Oh, even more shocking.
[02:38:35.000 --> 02:38:39.320]  The revelations about Mr. Rosenstein come as Mr. Trump has unleashed another round of attacks
[02:38:39.320 --> 02:38:45.560]  in recent days on federal law enforcement. No, on treasonous federal law enforcement. Thank you.
[02:38:45.560 --> 02:38:49.800]  Saying an interview with the Hill newspaper that he hopes his assaults on the FBI.
[02:38:50.440 --> 02:38:55.720]  Oh, they use that assaults on the FBI. No, the FBI is assaulting him. The FBI is assaulting
[02:38:55.720 --> 02:38:59.880]  this country. The FBI has been assaulting this country. They lied about the golf of talking.
[02:38:59.880 --> 02:39:05.080]  They lied about Hitler. They lied about the JFK assassination. They'll lie about anything.
[02:39:06.040 --> 02:39:09.400]  They're the treasonous ones. They're the ones assaulting this country.
[02:39:09.400 --> 02:39:19.720]  And you know what? If President Trump actually drains the swamp, which is not going to happen
[02:39:19.720 --> 02:39:24.200]  from tweeting, then it will be his greatest accomplishment ever. If he puts Hillary in
[02:39:24.200 --> 02:39:29.320]  jail, if he exposes Obama for his high crimes, that will be the greatest achievement,
[02:39:29.320 --> 02:39:36.840]  not just for President Trump, but for this nation's history. It will be. And it's the
[02:39:36.840 --> 02:39:41.720]  only chance we have a survival. The only chance we have of survival.
[02:39:47.800 --> 02:39:52.120]  Here's a quote from Trump. If I did one mistake with Comey, I should have fired him long.
[02:39:52.760 --> 02:39:57.000]  I should have fired him before I got there. I should have fired him the day I won the primaries.
[02:39:57.000 --> 02:40:01.480]  I should have fired him right after the convention. Say I don't want that guy or at least fired him
[02:40:01.480 --> 02:40:05.800]  the first day of the job. Mr. Trump, President Trump, you're going to say the exact same thing
[02:40:05.800 --> 02:40:14.360]  about Robert Mueller in two years if you don't fire him now and anyone else under him.
[02:40:15.400 --> 02:40:18.520]  Days after ascending to the role of nation's number two law enforcement officer,
[02:40:18.520 --> 02:40:24.760]  Mr. Rosenstein was thrust into a crisis. No, they created the crisis. On a brisk May day,
[02:40:24.760 --> 02:40:30.680]  Mr. Rosenstein and his boss, Mr. Sessions, missing in action, joined Mr. Trump in the Oval Office,
[02:40:30.680 --> 02:40:34.760]  where the president informed them of his plan to oust Mr. Comey to the surprise of White House
[02:40:34.760 --> 02:40:39.720]  Aids who were trying to talk the president out of it. Oh, why is that? Mr. Rosenstein embraced
[02:40:39.720 --> 02:40:45.160]  the idea, even offering to write the memo about the Clinton email inquiry he turned it in shortly
[02:40:45.160 --> 02:40:50.920]  after. A day later, Mr. Trump announced the firing and White House White House Aids released Mr.
[02:40:50.920 --> 02:40:56.760]  Rosenstein's memo, labeling it the basis for Mr. Comey's dismissal. Democrats sharply criticized
[02:40:56.760 --> 02:41:01.880]  Mr. Rosenstein, accusing him of helping to create a cover story for the president to rationalize
[02:41:01.880 --> 02:41:08.360]  the termination. Okay, so he writes a real memo about how Comey totally botched and even had a
[02:41:08.360 --> 02:41:15.160]  rigged investigation at Hillary and they say, how dare you let the president know we let Hillary
[02:41:15.160 --> 02:41:19.960]  off scot-free? How dare you let the president know we let Hillary Clinton break the law?
[02:41:19.960 --> 02:41:25.080]  How dare you let the president know that Hillary Clinton had Chinese operatives inside her email,
[02:41:25.080 --> 02:41:30.600]  her illegal email server, and then they killed 20 assets in China and tortured them?
[02:41:30.600 --> 02:41:35.160]  Yeah, how dare you let the president know that Hillary should be allowed to do that?
[02:41:38.520 --> 02:41:44.840]  Senator Christopher Murphy writes that scum. You wrote a memo that you knew would be used to
[02:41:46.200 --> 02:41:52.600]  perpetuate a lie. You own this debacle. What lie? Oh, you mean Hillary Clinton didn't break the law?
[02:41:52.600 --> 02:41:56.840]  I mean, see, this is what I'm telling you, folks. These Democrats, I don't know what it, are they
[02:41:56.840 --> 02:42:02.040]  all raping kids? I mean, seriously, are all of these Democrats raping children? Why are they such
[02:42:02.040 --> 02:42:06.520]  liars? What do they have to hide? Why do they hate this country? Why do they hate the truth?
[02:42:09.240 --> 02:42:15.320]  No, I'm serious. I don't get it. I don't get it. Why are they so committed to the just total
[02:42:15.320 --> 02:42:20.360]  lies? Why are they so committed to killing this country? Why do they sit here and ignore any and
[02:42:20.360 --> 02:42:27.880]  everything accused or alleged against the Democrat? But if a mouse crawls out from a rat,
[02:42:27.880 --> 02:42:35.800]  if a rat crawls out of a dumpster and goes, oh, did you hear that rat? That rat said Trump raped
[02:42:35.800 --> 02:42:43.160]  it 30 years ago. Get that rat on stand. Get that rat needs to testify against Trump. That rat,
[02:42:43.800 --> 02:42:48.120]  get that rat. That rat can bring Trump down. He's got real allegations to get Trump.
[02:42:48.120 --> 02:42:51.560]  What the hell is wrong with these people, man? When will Trump act? Bring these people down.
[02:42:51.560 --> 02:42:58.600]  They have freaking spirit cookings, man. X2. We were selling it for about three years,
[02:42:58.600 --> 02:43:02.200]  and then they found out how big it was. And I was, we were buying, and they said, oh, we want
[02:43:02.200 --> 02:43:06.920]  more money, more money, and oh, this and that. And so I've broken my contract. And right now,
[02:43:06.920 --> 02:43:12.440]  we can't get more of this proprietary ingredient that goes in X2 that literally is so pure that
[02:43:12.440 --> 02:43:18.200]  if you put it in a peaker dish on top of 90 degree hot plate, it gasses like I dream of genie and it's
[02:43:18.200 --> 02:43:22.120]  purple gas. I mean, that is so pure. It just goes right into your body when you take it.
[02:43:22.120 --> 02:43:26.760]  We're working on trying to get other suppliers right now, but I bought a huge amount of it,
[02:43:27.480 --> 02:43:31.960]  ordered it six months ago. So I get the price down. I said, if you don't lower it, I'm done.
[02:43:31.960 --> 02:43:36.680]  I'm breaking the contract. Well, I broke the contract last week. And so this is potentially
[02:43:36.680 --> 02:43:41.720]  the last run. In fact, right now it is the last run of survival shield X2. And we've,
[02:43:41.720 --> 02:43:46.360]  we've got a good supply of it. It'll be gone a couple of months. X2, if you haven't experienced it
[02:43:46.360 --> 02:43:50.440]  in foreshore.com, if you have experienced it, and how great it is, I suggest you stop up on it.
[02:43:50.440 --> 02:43:55.000]  It's available right now for a limited time in foreshore.com. It's 25% off right now.
[02:43:55.000 --> 02:44:00.680]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is. The real drama can be found here
[02:44:00.680 --> 02:44:05.720]  in Leilani estates, but a lot of us on the big island rely on rainwater. And we need to be
[02:44:05.720 --> 02:44:12.760]  concerned about ash and acid rain. Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles and acid rain
[02:44:12.760 --> 02:44:18.760]  could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels. To find out, we employed a series of tests
[02:44:18.760 --> 02:44:24.680]  for heavy metals, alkalinity and pH. What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy
[02:44:24.680 --> 02:44:29.880]  levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater. Next, we tested the water from our
[02:44:29.880 --> 02:44:35.800]  Alexa pure gravity filter. And not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the
[02:44:35.800 --> 02:44:42.760]  pH was also restored to optimal levels. As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa pure raises the
[02:44:42.760 --> 02:44:48.520]  pH of the water. So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a
[02:44:48.520 --> 02:44:54.120]  rainwater supply. But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.

[02:47:22.440 --> 02:47:27.880]  your host, Owen Shroyer. Alright, I'm gonna finish up with the New York Times story and then
[02:47:27.880 --> 02:47:31.560]  Breaking Judicial Watch story and then Roger Stone is gonna bring in his expertise here
[02:47:32.520 --> 02:47:38.280]  to break this down. Going back to New York Times though, the President's reliance on his memo caught
[02:47:38.280 --> 02:47:42.440]  Mr. Rosenstein by surprise and he became angry at Mr. Trump, according to people who spoke to
[02:47:42.440 --> 02:47:47.560]  Mr. Rosenstein at the time. Well, how does that make any sense? If you write a memo suggesting
[02:47:47.560 --> 02:47:52.840]  something to the President and then he follows through on it, why would that catch you by surprise?
[02:47:52.840 --> 02:47:56.520]  Why would that make you angry? I don't know. I guess you'll have to ask Rosenstein.
[02:47:57.080 --> 02:48:02.520]  Goes on. Mr. Rosenstein then raised the idea of wearing a recording device or wire,
[02:48:02.520 --> 02:48:06.600]  as he put it, to secretly take the President when he visited the White House.
[02:48:06.600 --> 02:48:10.360]  One participant asked whether Mr. Rosenstein was serious and he replied
[02:48:11.400 --> 02:48:16.760]  adamantly that he was. Now, can you imagine if someone had a secret wire taping Obama?
[02:48:16.760 --> 02:48:20.440]  We've already heard some of the stuff from Secret Service, what Obama was engaged in,
[02:48:20.440 --> 02:48:25.240]  but I mean, my goodness. If not him, then Mr. McCabe or other FBI officials interviewing
[02:48:25.240 --> 02:48:29.320]  with Mr. Trump for the job could perhaps wear a wire or otherwise record the President Mr.
[02:48:29.320 --> 02:48:33.560]  Rosenstein offered. So here he is actively engaging in a coup against the President,
[02:48:33.560 --> 02:48:39.400]  against America. White House officials never checked his phone when he arrived for meetings there,
[02:48:39.400 --> 02:48:43.000]  Mr. Rosenstein added, implying it would be easily to secretly record Mr. Trump.
[02:48:43.000 --> 02:48:48.680]  Well, I got news for you. Mr. Trump, as you put it, is not as dumb as you might think,
[02:48:49.240 --> 02:48:56.600]  and he records everything already. I digress. Mr. Rosenstein's suggestion about the 25th Amendment
[02:48:56.600 --> 02:49:01.480]  was similarly a sensitive topic. The amendment allows for the Vice President and majority of
[02:49:01.480 --> 02:49:05.880]  Cabinet officials to declare the President is unable to discharge the powers and duties of
[02:49:05.880 --> 02:49:13.960]  his office. So just imagine here's President Trump making progress with North Korea, saving
[02:49:13.960 --> 02:49:22.040]  the economy to degrees we can't even imagine, having huge rallies. He's doing two a week now
[02:49:22.040 --> 02:49:27.800]  when tens of thousands of people show up cheering him. He speaks for hours on end without a teleprompter,
[02:49:27.800 --> 02:49:33.320]  fully coherent, and they think that they can say he should be removed for the 25th Amendment
[02:49:33.320 --> 02:49:40.760]  because he's unable to discharge his powers. I mean, folks, you know, this is just unbelievable
[02:49:41.320 --> 02:49:44.760]  that they think they can get away with that. But this is what the Democrats do. They think
[02:49:44.760 --> 02:49:49.640]  they can bring up some high school slut to stop Brett Kavanaugh from getting on the Supreme Court.
[02:49:49.640 --> 02:49:57.000]  Yeah, I said it. Christine Blazy Ford is a high school slut, floozy. Go ahead and put that on
[02:49:57.000 --> 02:50:03.400]  media matters. I don't care. Someone has to say it. Oh, but Judicial Watch comes out with a story
[02:50:03.400 --> 02:50:08.840]  headline. New FBI records reveal stroke-authored initial draft of Comey letter to Congress about
[02:50:08.840 --> 02:50:17.880]  Clinton emails on Weiner laptop. And so the picture comes even more clearer. Folks, this is such a
[02:50:17.880 --> 02:50:25.240]  rigged job. It's not even funny. So I bring Roger Stone in now. Roger, something came clear to me
[02:50:25.240 --> 02:50:30.360]  today. You started telling, you started reporting right here at Infowars and trying to get the
[02:50:30.360 --> 02:50:34.600]  message to President Trump that they were going to use the 25th Amendment against him.
[02:50:35.560 --> 02:50:40.680]  Right after you did that, whether it was John Kelly or other powers that be,
[02:50:41.800 --> 02:50:48.280]  stopped Infowars from getting to the President's desk. They put a cease and desist on all Infowars
[02:50:48.280 --> 02:50:52.520]  material getting to the President's desk. Do you think President Trump is going to recognize
[02:50:52.520 --> 02:50:56.520]  what the hell's going on here? We told them they were coming for the 25th Amendment. Now the New
[02:50:56.520 --> 02:51:02.360]  York Times tells them after the FISA warrant is about to be declassified as a soft launch to let
[02:51:02.360 --> 02:51:07.640]  the President know, yes, there was a coup against you. Yes, it was the 25th Amendment, but they were
[02:51:07.640 --> 02:51:12.840]  doing it for the right reasons. I mean, Roger, just what do you make of this? Well, first of all,
[02:51:12.840 --> 02:51:18.040]  you're absolutely right, Owen. Infowars was the first major media organization in the country
[02:51:18.040 --> 02:51:25.880]  to report on the fact that there would be a 25th Amendment coup to try to take down the President
[02:51:25.880 --> 02:51:33.960]  that if the Russian collusion frame job failed, which it clearly has, that the next line of defense
[02:51:33.960 --> 02:51:42.520]  for the deeply entrenched two-party duopoly would be a 25th Amendment coup. Now we have the deputy
[02:51:42.520 --> 02:51:49.400]  Attorney General, the in fact, the de facto Attorney General of the United States caught red-handed
[02:51:49.960 --> 02:51:56.280]  plotting against his boss, the President of the United States. The reason that they want to take
[02:51:56.280 --> 02:52:03.400]  the President down is abundantly clear in the controversy over the President's order to declassify
[02:52:03.400 --> 02:52:11.400]  all of the information pertaining to the illegal and unconstitutional use of FISA warrants by the
[02:52:11.400 --> 02:52:18.440]  Obama administration. Now, defying the President's orders, the intelligence agencies insist on
[02:52:18.440 --> 02:52:27.080]  continuing to redact part of that information, claiming falsely that it would somehow endanger
[02:52:27.080 --> 02:52:36.920]  the national security or would expose their methods abroad or here in terms of surveillance.
[02:52:36.920 --> 02:52:44.440]  These are fake excuses. They're covering up the political use and abuse of power to surveil
[02:52:44.440 --> 02:52:51.480]  the Republican candidate for President. If President Trump does not now fire Mr. Rosenstein,
[02:52:51.480 --> 02:52:59.880]  when will he do so? Their desire to remove him is directly related to the fact that he is about
[02:52:59.880 --> 02:53:10.120]  to expose them in the largest political scandal in American history. Roger, I mean, I don't even
[02:53:10.120 --> 02:53:15.320]  know how to explain my mood. I mean, people can see it from tuning in today, but we're in a state of
[02:53:15.320 --> 02:53:22.840]  emergency. And I just don't know if President Trump fully understands it. Obviously, he's smart.
[02:53:22.840 --> 02:53:28.760]  Obviously, he gets it. He talks about it. But I mean, what is he waiting for? That, you know,
[02:53:28.760 --> 02:53:33.000]  that to me is the bit. What are you waiting for, President Trump? They're coming for you. They're
[02:53:33.000 --> 02:53:40.440]  coming for this country. They have to be stopped. He doesn't just... Roger, he needs to fire everyone.
[02:53:41.240 --> 02:53:48.040]  Everyone needs to be fired. I'm serious, man. Well, Owen, actually, I think today's a very
[02:53:48.040 --> 02:53:54.760]  good day because the Rosenstein story is not in some obscure conservative website,
[02:53:54.760 --> 02:54:00.600]  but it's broken by The New York Times. That means that there's zero chance that the president doesn't
[02:54:00.600 --> 02:54:05.720]  see it. You see, around the president, there's a huge game of keep away that goes on constantly,
[02:54:05.720 --> 02:54:12.040]  while Kelly and his other hindlers try to stop him from seeing what's really going on. Meanwhile,
[02:54:12.040 --> 02:54:16.600]  they keep giving him terrible advice. For example, a story in the Hill today that says,
[02:54:16.600 --> 02:54:24.520]  a number of our foreign allies are concerned about this order to redact because it may affect them.
[02:54:24.520 --> 02:54:32.120]  This is nonsense. The president is surrounded by either timid advisors or advisors who are putting
[02:54:32.120 --> 02:54:39.080]  their interests in the interest of the deep state that they serve ahead of the president's interest.
[02:54:39.080 --> 02:54:45.560]  For example, arguing, oh, don't fire Mr. Sessions and Mr. Rosenstein before the election. That'll
[02:54:45.560 --> 02:54:51.320]  hurt you in the election. Fire them after the election. Then, if the elections don't go well,
[02:54:51.320 --> 02:54:56.760]  they'll say, oh, you can't fire them now. You don't have the political support in the country to do
[02:54:56.760 --> 02:55:02.840]  so. The president really does need to fire everybody and start over again with a few
[02:55:02.840 --> 02:55:09.880]  exceptions. Larry Kudlow is doing an incredible job implementing the president's plan to revitalize
[02:55:09.880 --> 02:55:15.560]  the American economy. There are a few patriots in the White House, but not many.
[02:55:15.560 --> 02:55:22.760]  Well, and look, I don't think John Kelly is the enemy of this country by any stretch.
[02:55:22.760 --> 02:55:27.720]  I don't think John Kelly is bad, but if John Kelly is playing any sort of role as a filter or
[02:55:27.720 --> 02:55:33.400]  keep away, he's got to go. I'm sorry. He's got to go, too, because nobody else is going to tell the
[02:55:33.400 --> 02:55:38.360]  president what's actually going on. Nobody else is going to raise the red flag, raise the alarm,
[02:55:38.360 --> 02:55:43.960]  like infowars. And if John Kelly is keeping us off the president's desk, then President Trump's
[02:55:43.960 --> 02:55:49.960]  never going to understand how serious this is. Let's be clear. General John Kelly,
[02:55:49.960 --> 02:55:56.520]  just like General Mattis, have a first loyalty to the military industrial complex to the deep
[02:55:56.520 --> 02:56:02.680]  state. We know, for example, that Mattis voted for Hillary Clinton and spoke for her during the
[02:56:02.680 --> 02:56:07.880]  election. The president keeps referring to him as Mad Dog, a nickname that, from what I understand,
[02:56:07.880 --> 02:56:14.520]  he despises and he denigrates the president behind his back. Kelly thinks his job is to
[02:56:14.520 --> 02:56:20.840]  save the world from Donald Trump, not understanding the president's eccentric operating and management
[02:56:20.840 --> 02:56:27.000]  style, which, by the way, works. Look at the American economy. Now he threatens the deep state
[02:56:27.000 --> 02:56:35.000]  as never before because their entire Russian delusion, collusion, fraud will collapse. It was
[02:56:35.000 --> 02:56:41.960]  only built as a diversion from the real crimes of the Obama administration pertaining to the
[02:56:41.960 --> 02:56:49.240]  misuse of FISA warrants. This fight is getting riper by the day, but unfortunately it's the drip,
[02:56:49.240 --> 02:56:54.840]  drip, drip of information that comes out while the mainstream media continues to harp on
[02:56:54.840 --> 02:57:02.120]  non-existent Russian collusion. We learned only recently that Bruce Orr had briefed
[02:57:02.120 --> 02:57:09.480]  Adam Weissman, the number two man in the Mueller investigation on both the fabrication of the
[02:57:09.480 --> 02:57:15.720]  dossier and that Andrew Weissman had been the deputy attorney general who signed off on the
[02:57:15.720 --> 02:57:23.720]  extension of that illegal warrant. So the deep state is in deep trouble and that's why they are
[02:57:23.720 --> 02:57:31.800]  talking about a 25th Amendment takedown. This is the fight for the republic. We are in the fight
[02:57:31.800 --> 02:57:38.200]  for America right now. Do not be twisted, folks. Do not be confused. This is the fight for America.
[02:57:38.200 --> 02:57:44.120]  President Trump is the last president to save America. Either we win now or America dies at
[02:57:44.120 --> 02:57:50.280]  the hands of the Democrats. We are kept afloat only by your loyal patronage and that's why we need
[02:57:50.280 --> 02:57:55.480]  you to go to the site now. If you're not in the market for one of our greatest nutraceuticals,
[02:57:55.480 --> 02:58:01.560]  please consider a contribution. Twenty-five, fifty-a-hundred, two-fifty or even five hundred
[02:58:01.560 --> 02:58:07.720]  dollars would be of God's end to our important work here to beat back the globalists and to
[02:58:07.720 --> 02:58:25.480]  destroy their campaign of censorship in which they want to strangle our first amendment rights.
[02:58:38.680 --> 02:58:43.160]  on the globalist at point-blank range and with your help spreading it and with your help downloading
[02:58:43.160 --> 02:58:50.600]  it, we are unstoppable. I want to plow into all of this. Then I'm going to spend a few minutes
[02:58:50.600 --> 02:58:57.160]  here first, just encouraging listeners to understand that when you buy t-shirts or water

[02:59:43.720 --> 02:59:56.360]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[03:00:13.960 --> 03:00:37.160]  Welcome to the Alex Jones show, still on the air, still fighting the forces of censorship,
[03:00:37.160 --> 03:00:41.720]  fighting for the First Amendment. I'm Joel Gilbert, guest hosting this hour, coming to you from the
[03:00:41.720 --> 03:00:46.920]  People's Republic of California, right from the left coast. You know me as a frequent guest of
[03:00:46.920 --> 03:00:53.880]  Alex, filmmaker, don't forget the new film, Trump, the Art of the Insult, buy it in the InfoWars store,
[03:00:53.880 --> 03:01:01.400]  support InfoWars, Trump, the Art of the Insult. Got a lot to cover this hour. We're going to first get
[03:01:01.400 --> 03:01:07.640]  started by talking about John Kerry. John Kerry, we hadn't used this past week, undermining the
[03:01:07.640 --> 03:01:13.800]  United States once again. He's been illegally advising and negotiating with the Iranian regime
[03:01:13.800 --> 03:01:21.400]  how to deal with and overcome Donald Trump's sanctions, trying to salvage the badly flawed
[03:01:21.400 --> 03:01:29.160]  Iranian nuclear deal. Now remember, Obama's notorious 2015 nuclear deal transferred billions
[03:01:29.160 --> 03:01:35.320]  of dollars on pallets and cash to the world's leading exporter of terrorism and it gave them
[03:01:35.320 --> 03:01:42.040]  a pathway to acquire nuclear weapons at the end of 10 years. That would be 2025. Now Obama and
[03:01:42.040 --> 03:01:47.160]  Kerry did not take the deal to Congress because it had no support. It was just a personal deal
[03:01:48.040 --> 03:01:56.840]  between Obama and the Iranians and Trump canceled the deal, of course, and slammed Iran with new
[03:01:56.840 --> 03:02:02.600]  sanctions. So John Kerry goes to Paris to meet with the Iranians and undermine U.S. policy.
[03:02:02.600 --> 03:02:06.840]  Let's play this short video reminding us because we've seen this movie once before.
[03:02:06.840 --> 03:02:12.760]  I want to see John Kerry before Congress in 1971. Let's remind ourselves what he was up to.
[03:02:17.800 --> 03:02:23.240]  Okay, we'll bring that up next segment. I'm going to bring on Frank Hawkins has written
[03:02:23.240 --> 03:02:28.440]  an article. He is the former U.S. Army Intelligence Officer, Associated Press,
[03:02:28.440 --> 03:02:34.440]  Foreign Correspondent, and his new article, American Thinker, is John Kerry, a Trader
[03:02:34.440 --> 03:02:39.320]  for the Ages. And Frank, are you there? Welcome back to the show.
[03:02:39.880 --> 03:02:42.360]  Yes, thanks very much. It's good to be back, Joel.
[03:02:43.560 --> 03:02:48.040]  Okay, so first of all, we got just two minutes before the break. Then we'll take it up again
[03:02:48.040 --> 03:02:53.720]  with a video. What did John Kerry do in the Vietnam era? How much time did he serve in
[03:02:53.720 --> 03:03:01.800]  Vietnam? And what did he do as soon as he came back? A couple things. Starting off,
[03:03:01.800 --> 03:03:07.560]  Kerry served the normal kind of duty for someone serving in Vietnam was one year.
[03:03:08.920 --> 03:03:16.520]  Kerry served a total of four months. And the reason he got out early was because he had
[03:03:16.520 --> 03:03:21.240]  received a number of medals, including three purple hearts, the purple heart, of course,
[03:03:21.240 --> 03:03:29.480]  being the medal that you awarded if you were wounded while under fire in a combat situation.
[03:03:30.280 --> 03:03:37.480]  He had a silver star, and I think, yeah, he also had a bronze medal. So it's been,
[03:03:37.480 --> 03:03:45.640]  it was well established some time ago by John O'Neill, who wrote a book together with Jerome
[03:03:45.640 --> 03:03:52.840]  Corsi, who of course is very familiar to this audience. And basically, he ended up faking
[03:03:53.640 --> 03:04:00.040]  those medals. He was able to gain the system, and it was a very, it was a totally despicable
[03:04:00.040 --> 03:04:05.880]  bit of business. Okay, well, want to remind everyone, we are taking calls all this hour.
[03:04:05.880 --> 03:04:20.360]  The phone number is 1-877-789-2539. That's 877-789-2539-789 Alex. You can call and talk to myself
[03:04:20.360 --> 03:04:26.360]  and our guests. So we're going to come back after the break, continue with Frank Hawkins
[03:04:26.360 --> 03:04:32.040]  about John Kerry, who apparently we know now faked his injuries to serve only four months,
[03:04:32.040 --> 03:04:38.040]  apparently only enough time to get some film footage to come back and testify before Congress
[03:04:38.040 --> 03:04:43.720]  and begin his political career. We'll be right back in a couple of minutes with Frank Hawkins,
[03:04:43.720 --> 03:05:01.640]  former AP foreign correspondent on John Kerry, The Trader. Right back with you.
[03:05:13.720 --> 03:05:17.800]  I knew we had no future. We didn't do this. So we've already had incredible success.
[03:05:18.360 --> 03:05:23.640]  But if you will simply realize how epic this is and understand how real this fight is and why
[03:05:23.640 --> 03:05:28.600]  we've been made the main target, and if you financially support us, if you spread the word
[03:05:28.600 --> 03:05:35.160]  about our articles and videos, m4s.com, we won't just continue to stand up against these brutal
[03:05:35.160 --> 03:05:41.240]  scumbags. We'll win. We have huge sales, m4s.com right now. We're still able to operate the
[03:05:41.240 --> 03:05:45.000]  shopping cart, get stuff shipped out to you, despite the fact of trying to block our commerce,
[03:05:45.000 --> 03:05:49.080]  and you're right to the market. But if you don't stand up and support us financially,
[03:05:49.080 --> 03:05:57.160]  sorrow's the blood we'll spend when this is m4s.com. We're your support. I'm counting on you.
[03:05:57.160 --> 03:06:12.120]  He aligns himself with the truth that it's time for you to choose a side. You're listening to Alex
[03:06:12.120 --> 03:06:20.280]  Jones. Welcome back to the Alex Jones show. Joel Gilbert coming to you from the People's
[03:06:20.280 --> 03:06:30.040]  Republic of California. We're continuing to take calls 877-789-Alex. And we're talking about John
[03:06:30.040 --> 03:06:36.280]  Kerry, part of the resistance. Ever since he came back from Vietnam, he's been advising the Iranians
[03:06:36.280 --> 03:06:42.600]  how to deal with Donald Trump and overcome the U.S. sanctions. Frank Hawkins wrote an article for
[03:06:42.600 --> 03:06:49.400]  the American thinker called John Kerry, A Trader for the Ages. Let's play a quick clip of John Kerry
[03:06:49.400 --> 03:06:57.240]  in Congress when he came back from Vietnam. We rationalize destroying villages in order to save
[03:06:57.240 --> 03:07:03.800]  them. We saw America lose her sense of morality as she accepted very coolly a me lie and refused to
[03:07:03.800 --> 03:07:09.320]  give up the image of American soldiers that hand out chocolate bars and chewing gum. We learned
[03:07:09.320 --> 03:07:15.720]  the meaning of free fire zones, shoot anything that moves. And we watched while America placed a
[03:07:15.720 --> 03:07:24.120]  cheapness on the lives of orientals. Okay, Frank. So tell us about what John Kerry was up to in
[03:07:24.120 --> 03:07:30.120]  Congress slandering the United States, slandering the U.S. military, and what was he trying to
[03:07:30.120 --> 03:07:36.360]  accomplish? And then what did he do and talk about his meetings with the Viet Cong in Paris at that
[03:07:36.360 --> 03:07:44.360]  time? Well, let me just point out, and it's very important to understand this piece of it. At the
[03:07:44.360 --> 03:07:52.440]  time that he testified in this Senate committee, and at the time that he went to Paris and met with
[03:07:52.440 --> 03:08:00.520]  both the Viet Cong and the North Vietnamese, he at that time was in fact still a reserve navy
[03:08:00.520 --> 03:08:07.880]  officer. So that's an important piece of background to understand what was going on when he went to
[03:08:07.880 --> 03:08:14.760]  Paris. And at that same time, by the way, Henry Kissinger was involved in negotiating an end
[03:08:15.880 --> 03:08:25.160]  to war with the communists. So and later, at one point, Kerry admitted, he said,
[03:08:25.160 --> 03:08:29.560]  I've been to Paris. I've talked with both delegations of the peace talks. As I say,
[03:08:29.560 --> 03:08:33.080]  the Democrat Republic of Vietnam and the provisional revolutionary government.
[03:08:33.080 --> 03:08:38.680]  And so he admitted what he'd done. That was most astonishing of all. I mean,
[03:08:38.680 --> 03:08:45.960]  the clear violation of the Logan Act. And a lot of people don't know, Joe,
[03:08:47.320 --> 03:08:52.440]  that during that time, he also published his own book. And by the way, I still,
[03:08:52.440 --> 03:08:57.880]  I have a copy of that book, and it is despicable what he did there. And one of the things he
[03:08:57.880 --> 03:09:04.760]  wrote in that book was he said, we were probably angriest about all that we were told about Vietnam
[03:09:04.760 --> 03:09:12.920]  and the mystical war to get that mystical war against communism. He went on to say that a new
[03:09:12.920 --> 03:09:18.600]  soldier, and by the way, that was the name of his book, The New Soldier, he said a new soldier
[03:09:18.600 --> 03:09:24.200]  has returned to America to a nation torn apart by the killing we were asked to do.
[03:09:24.200 --> 03:09:28.440]  He said, we will not quickly join those who march on Veterans Day.
[03:09:29.080 --> 03:09:34.680]  We will not readily join the American Legion or the veterans of foreign wars. We will not
[03:09:34.680 --> 03:09:41.320]  take solace from the creation of monuments. And, you know, since I have written this article and
[03:09:41.320 --> 03:09:47.240]  one of the other articles that I wrote for the American thinker that referenced Kerry as one of
[03:09:47.240 --> 03:09:54.360]  the most, as the most destructive America in my lifetime. It's amazing how many Vietnam vets
[03:09:55.400 --> 03:10:01.960]  have been in touch with me via email or by phone or whatever. And almost every one of them
[03:10:03.320 --> 03:10:09.240]  were aware of what traitor's behavior that Kerry undertook and what he'd done. And I tell
[03:10:09.240 --> 03:10:13.960]  you what, Joel, the anger is still out there among those vets, and it's very deep.
[03:10:13.960 --> 03:10:19.160]  Okay, let's put up that tweet from President Trump where he talks about
[03:10:20.920 --> 03:10:26.040]  John Kerry needing to be investigated for violations of the Constitution and the Logan Act,
[03:10:26.840 --> 03:10:32.840]  where he's talking about this is a violation of U.S. law. You cannot go and negotiate with foreign
[03:10:32.840 --> 03:10:38.840]  adversaries. That's only the role of U.S. government. Let's go real quick to, we got
[03:10:38.840 --> 03:10:45.240]  Chris in Alabama. Chris, go ahead. You're on the Alex Jones show with myself and Frank Hawkins.
[03:10:46.360 --> 03:10:52.440]  Hi, I'm Chris in Alabama. John Kerry should be, he should be indicted and although I have a lot
[03:10:52.440 --> 03:10:56.200]  of friends in the military and stuff, he should be brought in and indicted and prosecuted because
[03:10:56.760 --> 03:11:00.760]  the way I feel, he should be put in front of the fire squad and shot because what he's doing is wrong.
[03:11:00.760 --> 03:11:09.720]  Okay, Frank, look, give us some other highlights of John Kerry between betraying the United States
[03:11:09.720 --> 03:11:16.040]  with the Vietnamese to betraying the United States with the Iranians all in Paris. What
[03:11:16.040 --> 03:11:22.120]  are some of the other highlights or lowlights of his career? I think he also went to Nicaragua
[03:11:22.120 --> 03:11:28.200]  and cozyed up to the Sandinistas. That was one thing. And I think later on, of course, his daughter,
[03:11:28.200 --> 03:11:33.640]  we know, married an Iranian tied to the Iranian regime. What else can you tell us on the in-between
[03:11:33.640 --> 03:11:39.080]  years of these bookends? In between is, I mean, all the things that you have just pointed out,
[03:11:39.080 --> 03:11:45.400]  of course, we're very much correct. You know, after he came into the Senate,
[03:11:46.840 --> 03:11:52.760]  he, one of the first things he did in 1985, that he traveled to Nicaragua and he cozyed up to
[03:11:52.760 --> 03:12:02.600]  Ben President Daniel Ortega, a far left-wing Sandinista who had at that time very strong ties
[03:12:02.600 --> 03:12:09.400]  to Cuba and the Soviet Union, of course, and they had been accused on their own right of human
[03:12:09.400 --> 03:12:18.040]  rights abuses, but these were the guys he was cozying up to. And then again, in 2005, he surfaced
[03:12:18.040 --> 03:12:23.480]  with his old same old theme that he's always had, and that is slandering American troops.
[03:12:23.480 --> 03:12:29.240]  That's one of his favorite things to do, it would seem. And in 2005, he claimed that the U.S.
[03:12:29.240 --> 03:12:35.160]  forces were terrorizing the Iraqi people. And in fact, he told Bob Schaffer on Face to Nation,
[03:12:35.160 --> 03:12:39.720]  he said, look, he said, there's no reason, Bob, that young American soldiers need to be going
[03:12:39.720 --> 03:12:44.840]  into the homes of Iraqis and the dead at night, terrorizing kids and children. You know, women.
[03:12:44.840 --> 03:12:51.240]  I mean, this is just outrageous slander against our good military. And it just, in my opinion,
[03:12:51.240 --> 03:12:58.200]  of course, it's just, I think it's unforgivable. In fact, in 2006, he had a Democratic campaign
[03:12:58.200 --> 03:13:04.520]  rally in California. He told a group of college students, you know, education, if you make the
[03:13:04.520 --> 03:13:09.320]  most of it, you study hard, you do your homework, and you make an effort to be smart, you can do
[03:13:09.320 --> 03:13:16.520]  a role. If you don't, you get stuck in Iraq. I mean, where that- What about- What about a
[03:13:16.520 --> 03:13:22.920]  Secretary of State? He was Obama administration, one of the most hostile to the state of Israel,
[03:13:22.920 --> 03:13:30.920]  U.S. ally, only democracy in the region that has supported American defense initiatives for many
[03:13:30.920 --> 03:13:38.760]  years. What was his role in the Obama administration vis-a-vis Israel and their conflict with Hamas
[03:13:38.760 --> 03:13:49.960]  as well as Hizballah? Yeah, well, of course, see, he has- He- The Jerusalem Post recently had a
[03:13:49.960 --> 03:13:57.480]  piece in which he was- They accused Kerry of having an accurate and obsessive place in his heart for
[03:13:58.360 --> 03:14:08.360]  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, as well as Israel itself. And Kerry is one of those
[03:14:08.360 --> 03:14:12.920]  guys who said he's actually blamed Israel, you know, for the rise of the Islamic State.
[03:14:13.560 --> 03:14:21.400]  And he even went on to say the Islamic State's ideology has nothing to do with Islam. Of course,
[03:14:21.400 --> 03:14:28.760]  we all know it has everything to do with Islam. And the Jerusalem Post also reported that Kerry,
[03:14:30.040 --> 03:14:35.400]  earlier this year, met in London with a very close associate of the Palestinian Authority
[03:14:35.400 --> 03:14:41.800]  President Mahmoud Abbas. And the name of this guy is Hussein Aga. And he met for him with a long
[03:14:41.800 --> 03:14:49.960]  conversation. And Kerry told him, told Aga, to tell Abbas, that Trump will not remain in office
[03:14:49.960 --> 03:14:55.480]  for a long time. It was reported that Kerry said that within a year, there's a good chance that
[03:14:55.480 --> 03:14:59.160]  Trump would not be in the White House. And what could be more treasonous than that?
[03:14:59.160 --> 03:15:06.040]  Right. Well, the radical left has always been very hostile toward Israel, Israel being a
[03:15:06.840 --> 03:15:13.240]  national state with strong borders, strong defense and Western values. This has always
[03:15:13.240 --> 03:15:19.720]  been something that the left has been hostile and unhappy about. So it's no surprise that
[03:15:19.720 --> 03:15:24.840]  being anti-Israel was part of Kerry's makeup, as well as being anti-American all these years,
[03:15:24.840 --> 03:15:29.960]  someone who almost became president, don't forget. I'm going to come back in three minutes.

[03:20:14.840 --> 03:20:20.440]  Gilbert coming to you from the People's Republic of California. We're gonna talk about now one of
[03:20:20.440 --> 03:20:27.080]  my favorite U.S. senators, Ted Cruz. Ted Cruz is considered to be in some trouble in Texas.
[03:20:27.080 --> 03:20:35.160]  There is a lot of enthusiasm for one Beto O'Rourke, a Irish descended guy with a Hispanic name.
[03:20:35.960 --> 03:20:41.560]  And Trump has agreed to go to Texas to do a big rally in October to bail him out, hopefully.
[03:20:41.560 --> 03:20:48.200]  Let's take a look at a video of talking about a recent poll. What's going on in Texas with Cruz
[03:20:48.200 --> 03:20:53.320]  and Beto O'Rourke. Let's take a look. Well, the Senate race in Texas is gaining national attention
[03:20:53.320 --> 03:20:59.160]  ahead of November's midterms and one poll is giving an edge to the Democrats. A recent Ifsauce
[03:20:59.160 --> 03:21:04.760]  Reuters poll gives Democratic Congressman Beto O'Rourke a two-point advantage over Republican
[03:21:04.760 --> 03:21:11.400]  Senator Ted Cruz. President Trump has said he plans to hold a major rally for Cruz in Texas
[03:21:11.400 --> 03:21:18.200]  in October. Alana Rocha is a multimedia reporter for the Texas Tribune. She joins us now from
[03:21:18.200 --> 03:21:24.200]  Austin, Texas. Good to see you. Thank you. Good morning. So Alana, Texas is a reliably red state,
[03:21:24.200 --> 03:21:29.960]  although it's sort of been inching towards Republican reporters some polls. You get the idea
[03:21:29.960 --> 03:21:36.920]  that the news is covering a lot of polls that show an even or Cruz even behind in a red state.
[03:21:36.920 --> 03:21:44.360]  So, look, Cruz's opponent is a lightweight. This guy worked as an Internet provider for
[03:21:44.360 --> 03:21:49.960]  10 years like customer service. He ran for El Paso City Council. I think he was in a band.
[03:21:50.760 --> 03:21:56.120]  Nothing wrong with that. But then he ran for Congress as a Democratic course. He never did
[03:21:56.120 --> 03:22:01.560]  anything in his whole life. He's a lightweight. Of course, Ted Cruz, a lot of experience,
[03:22:01.560 --> 03:22:06.920]  you know, Solicitor General of Texas, argued before the Supreme Court, deep knowledge of the
[03:22:06.920 --> 03:22:11.960]  Constitution and the law. The problem with Ted, if you say what's wrong with Ted Cruz,
[03:22:12.920 --> 03:22:18.200]  Ted's problem is he's not living up to his standard of excitement that he brought in the past.
[03:22:18.840 --> 03:22:26.520]  He was exciting when he was a man on a mission. When he comes in with this kind of a boring
[03:22:26.520 --> 03:22:32.280]  approach, he says things like, when there's extreme hatred on the left, don't respond in kind,
[03:22:32.280 --> 03:22:39.240]  have fun, be a warrior. So, Ted used to be the guy that would be bold and get in your face and
[03:22:39.240 --> 03:22:45.080]  stand up to Obama. First guy to stand up to Obama, shut down the government over Obamacare.
[03:22:45.880 --> 03:22:52.200]  100% support for Ted Cruz. People remember even this one. He read Cicero on the Senate floor.
[03:22:52.200 --> 03:22:57.880]  Let's remind ourselves how much and why people love Ted Cruz with the Cicero video.
[03:23:00.920 --> 03:23:07.480]  The words of Cicero, powerfully relevant, 2,077 years later.
[03:23:09.720 --> 03:23:15.880]  When, President Obama, do you mean to cease abusing our patience?
[03:23:15.880 --> 03:23:23.800]  How long is that madness of yours still to mock us? When is there to be an end to that unbridled
[03:23:23.800 --> 03:23:32.280]  audacity of yours, swaggering about as it does now? Do not the nightly guards placed on the border?
[03:23:33.240 --> 03:23:39.240]  Do not the watches posted throughout the city? Do not, does not the alarm of the people
[03:23:39.240 --> 03:23:47.240]  and the union of all good men and women? Does not the precaution taken of assemblies?
[03:23:47.240 --> 03:23:53.160]  Okay, let me break in here. This is the kind of thing that Ted did back in 2010, 11, 12,
[03:23:54.760 --> 03:24:02.520]  you know, I'm sorry, 2012, 13, 14. He was the bold leader and people loved him.
[03:24:02.520 --> 03:24:08.760]  In this campaign, Cruz is not giving anyone any particular reason to go out and vote for Cruz,
[03:24:08.760 --> 03:24:13.080]  other than the fear of the negative. He tried that in the presidential campaign. He would say,
[03:24:13.080 --> 03:24:18.440]  if you vote for Donald Trump, it's a vote for Hillary. So now he's saying, well, vote for me,
[03:24:18.440 --> 03:24:26.360]  so I can continue the Trump agenda. It's not really a mission. And Ted has to have a mission.
[03:24:26.360 --> 03:24:31.400]  And the reason for that is he's not a very personable person. He doesn't have the
[03:24:31.400 --> 03:24:39.160]  personability of most politicians. People misunderstand him in that way. He's not a
[03:24:39.160 --> 03:24:45.320]  natural politician. It's very hard for him. People mistakenly think this might be because Cruz is
[03:24:45.320 --> 03:24:52.920]  aloof or he's arrogant, but that's not true. Ted is just extremely shy. He's a very shy person.
[03:24:53.480 --> 03:24:59.560]  He doesn't warm up to people easily. Now, he's in politics for the principles upholding the
[03:24:59.560 --> 03:25:07.160]  Constitution. All the right reasons. He's not there to schmooze and he's not there to make friends.
[03:25:07.160 --> 03:25:13.560]  So Ted doesn't really have the personality or even the looks to get people to want to run out
[03:25:13.560 --> 03:25:18.760]  and vote for him. He has to have a mission. And he's repeating the same mistake of his
[03:25:18.760 --> 03:25:23.720]  presidential campaign where he didn't have a mission. He just said, well, I'm Ted Cruz,
[03:25:23.720 --> 03:25:29.880]  you know, go out and vote for me. Even though he was the outsider candidate, he was the guy that
[03:25:29.880 --> 03:25:34.760]  was going to drain the swamp. But when the election campaign started, he hired a very
[03:25:34.760 --> 03:25:41.720]  establishment campaign team. He had an establishment campaign strategy. Have a chairman in every
[03:25:41.720 --> 03:25:46.920]  state, a chairman in every county go through the motions of fundraising. But he was fundraising
[03:25:46.920 --> 03:25:52.680]  with no mission, with no message. And he's got the exact same team now in Texas. He's doing the
[03:25:52.680 --> 03:25:57.080]  exact same mistakes where he's just running around, raising money and giving a standard
[03:25:57.080 --> 03:26:03.000]  stump speech with no mission. Ted Cruz has to have a mission, a special agenda to get people
[03:26:03.000 --> 03:26:08.120]  motivated because he's not a natural politician that you're going to run and vote for. That's
[03:26:08.120 --> 03:26:12.280]  what happened in the presidential campaign. Donald Trump came along and said, okay, Ted,
[03:26:12.280 --> 03:26:16.440]  if you don't want to be Ted Cruz, you don't want to be that outsider guy that you've been talking
[03:26:16.440 --> 03:26:23.160]  about, I'll be Ted Cruz. And that's how Trump won as the Ted Cruz candidate, the drain, the swamp
[03:26:23.160 --> 03:26:28.680]  guy. Let's look at my clip from Art of the Insult and you'll see how the clash went down between
[03:26:29.720 --> 03:26:32.920]  Trump and Ted Cruz, a clip from Art of the Insult.
[03:26:32.920 --> 03:26:37.960]  So the media would love to see Donald and me getting the giant food fight. I'm certainly not
[03:26:37.960 --> 03:26:43.720]  going to engage in that. I hope Donald won't either. Trump retweeted this image, Cruz's wife
[03:26:43.720 --> 03:26:49.880]  in an unflattering pose next to Melania Trump. When I saw somebody tweeted a picture of Melania
[03:26:49.880 --> 03:26:54.840]  and a picture of Heidi. With the caption, no need to spill the beans, the images are worth a thousand
[03:26:54.840 --> 03:27:01.000]  words. An enraged Ted Cruz looking right into our camera to deliver this message to Donald Trump.
[03:27:01.000 --> 03:27:04.840]  Donald, you're a sniveling coward and leave Heidi the hell alone. I have to tell you,
[03:27:04.840 --> 03:27:10.840]  I think Heidi Cruz is a great person. I think it's the best thing he's got going at his kids,
[03:27:10.840 --> 03:27:15.080]  if you want to know the truth. Leave Heidi the hell alone. So will you support him as the nominee?
[03:27:17.320 --> 03:27:22.040]  I'm going to beat him. He was asked today about a National Enquirer story claiming he has had
[03:27:22.040 --> 03:27:29.400]  five mistresses. This National Enquirer story is garbage. It is complete and utter lies.
[03:27:29.400 --> 03:27:34.680]  And it is a smear that has come from Donald Trump and his henchmen. It is a story that quoted one
[03:27:34.680 --> 03:27:40.680]  source on the record, Roger Stone, Donald Trump's chief political advisor. Let me break in here.
[03:27:40.680 --> 03:27:47.800]  So you get the idea. When it came to a clash between Trump and Ted Cruz, Trump clearly won.
[03:27:47.800 --> 03:27:53.240]  Ted became unnerved. In principle, he didn't want to fight back. He said, I don't want to go that.
[03:27:53.240 --> 03:28:00.920]  I don't want to have a food fight. And, you know, Trump attacked him on all kind of areas and Ted
[03:28:00.920 --> 03:28:10.360]  just kind of melted down as Trump made the point. Anyway, Ted needs to rally. He needs to come up
[03:28:10.360 --> 03:28:15.560]  with a mission. He needs to explain why he can be the leader of this mission to preserve the
[03:28:15.560 --> 03:28:21.320]  Constitution, the defender of liberty again. Without that, I don't think the Texans are going
[03:28:21.320 --> 03:28:27.320]  to be so motivated to give Ted another six years in office. We're going to see Donald Trump go down
[03:28:27.320 --> 03:28:33.240]  and to Texas to a big rally. And hopefully we'll see if Ted, one of my favorite senators,
[03:28:34.040 --> 03:28:38.040]  he's the real deal. He believes in the Constitution. He believes in America.
[03:28:38.760 --> 03:28:43.880]  And but he's not a marketing guy. And he needs to follow his instincts. Trump followed his instincts
[03:28:43.880 --> 03:28:48.760]  and Ted did not. We'll be right back. We're going to talk about the socialism deniers
[03:28:49.400 --> 03:28:56.520]  in the next segment, 877-789 Alex. I tried other brands, but I came back to my sunshine.

[03:30:54.280 --> 03:30:59.640]  X2, we were selling it for about three years and then they found out how big it was and how much
[03:30:59.640 --> 03:31:04.200]  we were buying and they said, oh we want more money, more money and oh this and that and so I've
[03:31:04.200 --> 03:31:10.280]  broken my contract and right now we can't get more of this proprietary ingredient that goes in X2
[03:31:10.280 --> 03:31:15.880]  that literally is so pure that if you put in a peaker dish on top of 90 degree hot plate it gasses
[03:31:15.880 --> 03:31:20.280]  like I dream of genie and this is purple gas. I mean that is so pure it just goes right into your
[03:31:20.280 --> 03:31:25.320]  body when you take it. We're working on trying to get other suppliers right now but I bought a huge
[03:31:25.320 --> 03:31:30.760]  amount of it, ordered it six months ago so I get the price down and I said if you don't lower it
[03:31:30.760 --> 03:31:35.960]  I'm done, I'm breaking the contract. Well I broke the contract last week and so this is potentially
[03:31:35.960 --> 03:31:41.400]  the last run, in fact right now it is the last run of survival shield X2 and we've got a good
[03:31:41.400 --> 03:31:46.440]  supply of it, it'll be gone in a couple months. X2, if you haven't experienced it, InfawarsStore.com,
[03:31:46.440 --> 03:31:50.120]  if you have experienced it, you know how great it is, I suggest you stop up on it. It's available
[03:31:50.120 --> 03:31:56.120]  right now for a limited time. InfawarsStore.com is 25% off right now. Words cannot describe how big
[03:31:56.120 --> 03:32:01.160]  the stakes are for the future of humanity right now. Infawars is being openly targeted by the
[03:32:01.160 --> 03:32:07.000]  Democratic Party, left to CIA operatives, the corrupt justice department and the entire Soros
[03:32:07.000 --> 03:32:11.640]  crime syndicate. People say why would you start a fight with them? Because they were already dominating
[03:32:11.640 --> 03:32:16.520]  and running America into the ground and I knew we had no future if we didn't do this. So we've
[03:32:16.520 --> 03:32:22.360]  already had incredible success but if you will simply realize how epic this is and understand
[03:32:22.360 --> 03:32:27.480]  how real this fight is and why we've been made the main target and if you financially support us
[03:32:27.480 --> 03:32:33.240]  and if you spread the word about our articles and videos, Infawars.com, we won't just continue
[03:32:33.240 --> 03:32:39.160]  to stand up against these brutal scumbags, we'll win. We have huge sales at InfawarsStore.com right
[03:32:39.160 --> 03:32:43.560]  now and we're still able to operate the shopping cart and get stuff shipped out to you despite
[03:32:43.560 --> 03:32:47.880]  the fact we're trying to block our commerce and you're right to the market. But if you don't stand
[03:32:47.880 --> 03:32:52.200]  up and support us financially, Soros the Global is going to win. This is Infawars Darkest Hour,
[03:32:52.200 --> 03:33:08.120]  with your support, I'm counting on you. You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:08.120 --> 03:33:30.440]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show. Joel Gilbert guest hosting from the People's Republic of
[03:33:30.440 --> 03:33:41.560]  California right from the left coast. We'll be taking calls next couple segments 877-789-2539-877-789
[03:33:41.560 --> 03:33:48.760]  Alex. Now we've all heard of climate deniers and the Democrats like to call everybody deniers that
[03:33:48.760 --> 03:33:55.480]  doesn't believe in their view of the world. I have come up with a new term, I call it socialism
[03:33:55.480 --> 03:34:04.360]  deniers. The Democrat Party is now an open radical socialist party and Trump is letting them know,
[03:34:04.360 --> 03:34:09.320]  we saw even in the rally last night in Las Vegas, that they're looking to bring socialism,
[03:34:09.320 --> 03:34:16.120]  Venezuela style and worse, to America. Let's look at a clip of Trump at the UN talking about socialism
[03:34:16.120 --> 03:34:25.480]  in Venezuela. The problem in Venezuela is not that socialism has been poorly implemented,
[03:34:25.480 --> 03:34:32.840]  but that socialism has been faithfully implemented. Venezuela has the world's largest oil reserves,
[03:34:32.840 --> 03:34:38.280]  yet shortages of basic necessities like toilet paper and medicine abound. Citizens queue up for
[03:34:38.280 --> 03:34:45.720]  food at bear-shelled grocery stores, others pick through trash. Okay look, socialism means the
[03:34:45.720 --> 03:34:51.240]  things that Bernie Sanders campaigned on, breaking up American business, putting the government in
[03:34:51.240 --> 03:34:56.040]  control, breaking up the banking and pharmaceutical industries, agriculture. It's all about
[03:34:56.040 --> 03:35:01.720]  nationalization. The government takes over everything, the Department of Pharmacy, the
[03:35:01.720 --> 03:35:07.960]  Department of High Tech, and government officials are very inefficient, they're not very skilled.
[03:35:07.960 --> 03:35:12.840]  So you put state bureaucrats in charge of all these great businesses and the entire country
[03:35:12.840 --> 03:35:18.440]  becomes one big failing socialist enterprise. But people still go to Bernie Sanders rallies
[03:35:18.440 --> 03:35:22.760]  and they clap even though they have no idea what he's talking about. Let's look at a quick clip
[03:35:22.760 --> 03:35:26.680]  of Bernie and his socialism from the 2016 campaign.
[03:35:31.000 --> 03:35:42.200]  If Wall Street does not end its greed, we will end it for them. Not only will big banks not be
[03:35:42.200 --> 03:35:49.080]  too big to fail, but big time bankers will not be too big to jail.
[03:35:51.080 --> 03:35:56.680]  Right, this is communism. They put the bourgeois or the entrepreneurs in jail because they're
[03:35:56.680 --> 03:36:02.040]  evil and the government takes over all the industries. And then all the industries fail
[03:36:02.040 --> 03:36:09.720]  and everyone stars. I visited Russia when I was a student, 1984, the height of the Cold War. Andropov
[03:36:09.720 --> 03:36:15.960]  was a prime minister of Russia. And I visited many of the refuseniks, the people who were
[03:36:15.960 --> 03:36:21.560]  applying to leave Russia. And I'll tell you a conversation I had that explains everything
[03:36:21.560 --> 03:36:26.440]  you'll ever need to understand about socialism. I asked one of these guys, I asked him where he
[03:36:26.440 --> 03:36:31.800]  worked. He said, well, I work in a factory. I said, what do they make? He said, nothing.
[03:36:32.600 --> 03:36:37.880]  I said, well, how's that possible? He said, in communism, you don't work eight hours a day,
[03:36:37.880 --> 03:36:43.960]  you just have to be at work eight hours a day. And I said, why don't they fire you? He said,
[03:36:43.960 --> 03:36:49.240]  well, the manager is drunk and he doesn't work either. And I said, but don't you need to earn
[03:36:49.240 --> 03:36:56.120]  money? He said, why should I bother earning money? Have you ever been to any stores in Moscow? I said,
[03:36:56.120 --> 03:37:01.640]  yes, I have. And they're empty. He said, that's right, there's nothing to buy. So why should I work?
[03:37:01.640 --> 03:37:08.440]  So that's the story of socialism. It's depression, alcoholism, starvation. That's what they did in
[03:37:08.440 --> 03:37:15.320]  Venezuela. They nationalized everything, oil, agriculture, finance, telecommunications, food.
[03:37:16.120 --> 03:37:22.200]  Everything's going out of business. The history of socialism progressivism in the 20th century
[03:37:22.200 --> 03:37:29.080]  is that they murdered 150 million of their own citizens in peacetime to try to force them into
[03:37:29.080 --> 03:37:34.920]  this idea of this utopian world where the government controls everything and everyone is is so happy.
[03:37:35.480 --> 03:37:39.960]  I'll play a clip from my other film in the infowars store. There's no place like utopia
[03:37:41.160 --> 03:37:46.520]  talking about the communist ideology and what really goes down. Let's play that clip.
[03:37:48.280 --> 03:37:53.240]  In Cambodia, the communists killed everyone who had glasses. Because if you had glasses,
[03:37:53.240 --> 03:38:01.480]  you could read. You were educated. You have to do something with the people who have the
[03:38:01.480 --> 03:38:07.160]  bad knowledge in their head. So we're going to start with a clean slate and just create new human beings.
[03:38:10.440 --> 03:38:15.480]  It's a very evil idea. In the south, there are still generations of people
[03:38:15.480 --> 03:38:24.280]  and they just have to die. They just have to die. The most evil atrocities of our time
[03:38:24.280 --> 03:38:29.320]  have been committed by utopians in power. They think that they are the divinity.
[03:38:30.040 --> 03:38:33.320]  That's why they're so dangerous. That's why they kill so many people.
[03:38:35.640 --> 03:38:41.160]  All right. So look, today's Democrat Party has adopted this agenda. They're denying,
[03:38:41.160 --> 03:38:47.320]  they're in denial that it's a hundred years of complete failure. So I call these Democrats today,
[03:38:47.320 --> 03:38:52.360]  the socialism deniers. Let's take a look at the socialism deniers, Bernie Sanders.
[03:38:53.160 --> 03:39:00.040]  He's a big socialism denier, but he's managed to get the rest of the Democrat Party to go along
[03:39:00.040 --> 03:39:06.440]  with his socialism. Let's put up the photo of Bernie Sanders, the denier. Next one,
[03:39:06.440 --> 03:39:13.240]  of course, Hillary Clinton. Socialism denier. Let's put up all those photos of the deniers.
[03:39:15.720 --> 03:39:23.880]  Barack Obama. Socialism denier. There's Hillary. There's Obama. Cory Booker. I'm just going to
[03:39:23.880 --> 03:39:31.080]  read them off. Socialism denier. Kamala Harris, right here from California. She's on the list.
[03:39:31.080 --> 03:39:37.320]  Socialism denier. Progressive socialists, they're all in denial. They won't tell you the truth about
[03:39:37.320 --> 03:39:44.440]  socialism. They deny the reality. Now they've got the new ones. Of course, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.
[03:39:44.440 --> 03:39:51.320]  She's in there. There's a socialism denier. We've got Andrew Gillum in Florida. Socialism denier.
[03:39:52.360 --> 03:39:57.880]  And this is a technique that the left has been using since the 1930s. People have seen my film,
[03:39:57.880 --> 03:40:04.920]  Dreams of My Real Father, and Obama's real father, real dad, the man who raised him, of course,
[03:40:04.920 --> 03:40:12.760]  Frank Marshall Davis, the Russian agent who raised him, was recruited by white communists in
[03:40:12.760 --> 03:40:18.200]  Chicago to try to trick black people into joining the communist movement. Now they wanted no part
[03:40:18.200 --> 03:40:24.200]  of it because blacks were religious people in Chicago. They believed in love thy neighbor.
[03:40:24.200 --> 03:40:29.160]  They weren't interested in class warfare or atheism. So they sent Frank Marshall Davis out to
[03:40:29.160 --> 03:40:35.480]  Hawaii to try to start a strike to take over the island because they wanted to remove U.S.
[03:40:35.480 --> 03:40:41.800]  naval forces from Hawaii. He started a strike that eventually failed. And in my film, I think I made
[03:40:42.680 --> 03:40:47.720]  an argument with a mountain of evidence that that's Obama's real dad, and that Obama then
[03:40:47.720 --> 03:40:53.880]  followed in his father's footsteps back to Chicago where white communists, Bill Ayers, former
[03:40:53.880 --> 03:40:59.720]  Weather Underground terrorist, had his father bring Obama to Chicago where he became a community
[03:40:59.720 --> 03:41:06.440]  agitator. They used the word organizer as a nice way of saying it. And Obama's job was to
[03:41:06.440 --> 03:41:12.120]  infiltrate the black church groups because they thought if they had a front man who was black,
[03:41:12.120 --> 03:41:17.240]  they could convince minorities to join the socialist movement even though it was completely
[03:41:17.240 --> 03:41:24.040]  against their own interests. Even the black community in Chicago were no fools. They rejected
[03:41:24.040 --> 03:41:29.880]  Obama. He was thought of as a phony, as a radical supported by communists. It was only when he put
[03:41:29.880 --> 03:41:37.000]  his presidential campaign together that he was able to present this story of my father's a goat
[03:41:37.000 --> 03:41:42.680]  herder from Kenya. I'm going to bring us all together and so on and so on. But it was a stealth
[03:41:42.680 --> 03:41:47.960]  socialism. It was a socialism where he pretended to be middle of the road. I'm going to cut the
[03:41:47.960 --> 03:41:52.440]  deficit in half. I'm going to support the Constitution. We're going to enforce our
[03:41:52.440 --> 03:41:58.040]  border laws. And as soon as he got into office, of course, he threw the voters under the bus
[03:41:58.040 --> 03:42:04.600]  and pursued this radical agenda that nobody voted for. Eight years later, the Democrat party is an
[03:42:04.600 --> 03:42:09.880]  open socialist party, but they are denying the reality of socialism. That's why I call all of
[03:42:09.880 --> 03:42:14.680]  these, let's put their pictures up again, the socialism deniers. It's going to be Hillary
[03:42:14.680 --> 03:42:24.040]  Clinton denier, Barack Obama, of course, denier, Cory Booker, socialism denier, Kamala Harris,
[03:42:24.040 --> 03:42:29.640]  socialism denier. These are the deniers of the reality. And now they've recruited these minorities
[03:42:29.640 --> 03:42:39.320]  like Acasio Cortez Gillum. These people are trying to manipulate people of the same race or identity
[03:42:39.320 --> 03:42:46.040]  into voting for this cause. And they're all put there by white socialists and communists.
[03:42:46.040 --> 03:42:50.520]  We'll be right back taking phone calls for the rest of the hour. Come on back after the break.
[03:42:53.160 --> 03:42:58.840]  Living in Volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is. The real drama can be found here
[03:42:58.840 --> 03:43:04.360]  in Leilani Estates. But a lot of us on the Big Island rely on rainwater. And we need to be concerned
[03:43:04.360 --> 03:43:11.480]  about ash and acid rain. Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles. And acid rain could lower
[03:43:11.480 --> 03:43:18.200]  the pH of the water to unhealthy levels. To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals,
[03:43:18.200 --> 03:43:24.040]  alkalinity, and pH. What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals
[03:43:24.040 --> 03:43:30.040]  and acidity in the rainwater. Next, we tested the water from our Alexa pure gravity filter.
[03:43:30.040 --> 03:43:35.880]  And not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to
[03:43:35.880 --> 03:43:42.600]  optimal levels. As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa pure raises the pH of the water.
[03:43:42.600 --> 03:43:48.200]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[03:43:48.200 --> 03:43:52.280]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[03:43:53.000 --> 03:43:58.440]  Do you realize that when you spread the links from infowars.com, when you spread the videos,
[03:43:58.440 --> 03:44:05.400]  you are changing the world. It's you that has defeated Hillary and the globalist. It is you,

[03:49:59.320 --> 03:50:05.240]  listener and not only for the information but you guys uh correctly identify the spiritual
[03:50:05.240 --> 03:50:10.040]  motivation of of people that are trying to destroy this country and rule the most intimate
[03:50:10.040 --> 03:50:17.800]  aspects of our lives as being you know leaning towards uh satanism as far as the uh upper echelon
[03:50:17.800 --> 03:50:24.040]  of the control grid goes and we know that we're right you know we know that we have got on our
[03:50:24.040 --> 03:50:29.880]  side that that we are standing for truth and justice in reality so so quick relying on other
[03:50:29.880 --> 03:50:35.720]  people to go out there and do it for you we need to get involved we need to okay all right well
[03:50:35.720 --> 03:50:41.240]  thanks thanks for the call look it's a good point these are interesting times and you hear obama
[03:50:41.240 --> 03:50:47.640]  running around michelle obama filling stadiums you got to be involved you got to vote well that's
[03:50:47.640 --> 03:50:55.400]  certainly true for everybody especially conservatives uh if we come out and vote uh we have the
[03:50:55.400 --> 03:51:01.480]  ability to do things ourselves if you don't go out and vote uh the radical left is busy registering
[03:51:01.480 --> 03:51:07.960]  everybody including uh illegals who can vote by mail and there's no way to track them voter fraud

[03:51:57.320 --> 03:52:02.040]  in texas what are you hearing and what are you feeling about the mood do people want to send
[03:52:02.040 --> 03:52:08.840]  ted cruise back to washington or does has he lost the uh the edge what do you think well see yeah well
[03:52:08.840 --> 03:52:14.840]  see i live in el paso texas actually and uh you know what um i'm a truck driver and i don't get much
[03:52:14.840 --> 03:52:22.600]  of the of the you know local news but when i do it's not looking too it's not looking too too good
[03:52:22.600 --> 03:52:34.600]  for for ted cruise because i mean well you know it's el paso for you but uh uh i mean uh okay well
[03:52:34.600 --> 03:52:38.920]  all right and then what do you want trump to do uh in terms of the deep state what's happening right
[03:52:38.920 --> 03:52:46.520]  now yeah see uh you know i'm hoping trump can do something about uh you know going um you know like
[03:52:46.520 --> 03:52:52.120]  uh you know indicting indicting the people that he has to indict you know i don't know what's taking
[03:52:52.120 --> 03:52:58.200]  him so long i mean i do hear you know alex jones and owens shroyer and everybody else rob do and
[03:52:58.200 --> 03:53:02.040]  everybody else you know talk about that you know it has you know it takes time you know he needs to
[03:53:02.040 --> 03:53:07.320]  get the people in place you know to get a good thorough investigation going but i mean sometimes
[03:53:07.320 --> 03:53:12.440]  i mean you gotta you gotta think and wonder if this is happening like you know like uh biblical
[03:53:12.440 --> 03:53:18.440]  proportions to like where it you know sometimes you you know you want to think that donald trump
[03:53:18.440 --> 03:53:25.240]  may be the the the biggest uh you know like uh uh how do you call it like uh you know the
[03:53:25.240 --> 03:53:30.120]  antichrist the biggest deception but you know i'm i'm still believing that he is not you know that
[03:53:30.120 --> 03:53:36.120]  he is thanks for the call look uh it's definitely a somewhat of a frustration and a mystery uh
[03:53:36.680 --> 03:53:43.160]  donald trump built a career on your fired uh and he just doesn't seem to want to pull the trigger
[03:53:43.160 --> 03:53:50.360]  on all these clearly conflicted uh bad actors the bias the deception uh bruce or i went to
[03:53:50.360 --> 03:53:55.240]  high school with bruce or i've known bruce or since i was six years old and uh he should have
[03:53:55.240 --> 03:54:01.000]  been fired a long time ago now i can tell you about bruce or that he actually is a very honest
[03:54:01.000 --> 03:54:07.560]  person and i think everything bruce or did was probably at the direction of his wife nellie or
[03:54:07.560 --> 03:54:14.520]  or who was a red diaper baby her mother was a uh communist supporter uh she went to russia studied
[03:54:14.520 --> 03:54:21.000]  russian became heavily involved with uh the whole russian collectivization writing about it so i
[03:54:21.000 --> 03:54:25.960]  think bruce uh got in way over his head but he should have been fired along with everybody else
[03:54:25.960 --> 03:54:31.960]  and trump seems to be holding back that's the one thing that the conservatives are just super
[03:54:31.960 --> 03:54:38.680]  frustrated why can't this guy pull the trigger already uh let's go ahead to uh dr kelly in
[03:54:38.680 --> 03:54:44.520]  california dr kelly from the people's republic welcome to the alex joneshow hey i'm used to
[03:54:44.520 --> 03:54:50.600]  having about 40 seconds so i'll make it quick um i'm thanking you for pointing out the issues with
[03:54:50.600 --> 03:54:58.120]  john carrey and i started faxing congress a couple years ago about violations of the logan act and
[03:54:58.120 --> 03:55:05.960]  that's 18 united states code annotated section 953 for those interested and the uh the socialism
[03:55:05.960 --> 03:55:13.960]  deniers jerry brown and uh camilla harris uh are also bar attorneys and that's the one thing that
[03:55:13.960 --> 03:55:20.520]  i'm grateful for is that donald trump is not a bar attorney and i think ted cruise needs to read the
[03:55:20.520 --> 03:55:27.320]  art of the deal and uh get it straightened out and um thank you for your work all right dr kelly
[03:55:27.320 --> 03:55:31.800]  thanks for all your comments look we've been through it on this show uh ted cruise is just
[03:55:31.800 --> 03:55:37.800]  going through the motions fundraising giving a standard speech he doesn't have the personality
[03:55:38.440 --> 03:55:44.200]  or the looks to be someone that you just say wow this guy i really want to send him to washington
[03:55:44.200 --> 03:55:49.000]  again he's just kind of hanging on like he did in the presidential race he needs to find a message
[03:55:49.000 --> 03:55:55.720]  and an agenda to justify why he needs to go back to washington hopefully uh trump will straighten
[03:55:55.720 --> 03:56:00.680]  him out when he shows up uh let's go to raffael in the bronx bronx new york raffael you're on the
[03:56:00.680 --> 03:56:07.800]  alex jones show hi how you doing i just want to say first of all thank you because you guys have
[03:56:07.800 --> 03:56:13.880]  made such a big impact i'm porto rican i'm calling from the bronx i just want to let donald trump know
[03:56:13.880 --> 03:56:20.520]  that he has a huge latin support i want him to know that and i feel that he should get more bolder
[03:56:20.520 --> 03:56:25.240]  you know there's so many people out here ready to take the streets as far as you know the same way
[03:56:25.240 --> 03:56:30.360]  that they're doing a peaceful protest we should he should lead us and and know that the support is
[03:56:30.360 --> 03:56:35.320]  definitely there we're waiting for him to just push that button and tell people to go out there
[03:56:35.320 --> 03:56:39.640]  because we're ready he has a huge support and i just want him to know that we we have his back
[03:56:39.640 --> 03:56:45.320]  and we're not okay well i tell me raffael why does he have that big support in the hispanic community
[03:56:45.320 --> 03:56:52.280]  why because because people need to realize that the latin community has always been conservative
[03:56:52.280 --> 03:56:58.200]  they they've been people people have been you know brainwashed to think that we're just supporting
