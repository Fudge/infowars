[00:27.520 --> 00:31.320]  Muslims from coming into the country bearing a crisis that's coming up after
[00:31.320 --> 00:36.240]  this special report Russia's threatening to use nuclear weapons on ISIS Putin
[00:36.240 --> 00:39.560]  actually tweeted that this morning I saw it and thought it was a joke no it's
[00:39.560 --> 00:44.640]  officially been put out by the Russian Defense Ministry Bernie Sanders pledges

[00:55.240 --> 00:59.600]  insiders gonna be on air with us and more but first is John Bowne report
[00:59.600 --> 01:04.760]  Obama boldly stated that the federal government has the Syrian refugee crisis
[01:04.760 --> 01:09.800]  under control we've hardened our defenses from airports to financial centers to
[01:09.800 --> 01:14.480]  other critical infrastructure intelligence and law enforcement agencies
[01:14.480 --> 01:19.720]  have disrupted countless plots here and overseas and worked around the clock to
[01:19.720 --> 01:25.200]  keep us safe our military and counterterrorism professionals have relentlessly
[01:25.200 --> 01:29.680]  pursued terrorist networks overseas disrupting safe havens in several
[01:29.680 --> 01:34.000]  different countries killing Osama bin Laden but Obama didn't happen to
[01:34.000 --> 01:39.000]  mention that representative Stephen Lynch Democrat of Massachusetts disclosed
[01:39.000 --> 01:43.600]  that a congressional investigation recently found that at least 72 people
[01:43.600 --> 01:47.840]  working at the Department of Homeland Security also were on the terror
[01:47.840 --> 01:52.280]  watch list what would have been a scandal 30 years ago was barely mentioned
[01:52.280 --> 01:58.680]  today enter Donald Trump Donald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete
[01:58.680 --> 02:05.560]  shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country's representatives
[02:05.560 --> 02:12.480]  can figure out what the hell is going on soon after that statement the liberal
[02:12.480 --> 02:17.640]  reactionaries on Twitter replied with fervor even going so far as to call for
[02:17.640 --> 02:23.040]  Trump's assassination tweets included can we kill Trump now he wants to impede
[02:23.040 --> 02:28.480]  Muslims from entering the US someone really needs to kill Trump ASAP
[02:28.480 --> 02:34.360]  somebody kill Trump I genuinely mean it and I'd rather murder Trump and rot in
[02:34.360 --> 02:39.240]  jail than let my kid grow up in a world with Trump as president fresh off of
[02:39.240 --> 02:43.160]  backtracking her statements disregarding the First Amendment it appears
[02:43.160 --> 02:47.720]  Attorney General Loretta Lynch would find all of this called a violent action
[02:47.720 --> 02:53.200]  at the very least predicating of course she won't bat an eye because Trump is on
[02:53.200 --> 02:57.560]  the wrong team the lame stream media began to weigh in with their bought and
[02:57.560 --> 03:02.200]  paid for tactics you have leaders from your own party in the key states of
[03:02.200 --> 03:07.280]  Iowa New Hampshire South Carolina you have galvanized political rivals all

[03:38.560 --> 03:44.480]  unhinged his policy proposals are not serious New Jersey Governor Chris Christie
[03:44.480 --> 03:47.960]  said this is the kind of thing that people say when they have no experience
[03:47.960 --> 03:52.040]  and don't know what they're talking about the billionaire GOP front-runner
[03:52.040 --> 03:58.080]  Trump argued that what I'm doing is no different than FDR likening his proposal
[03:58.080 --> 04:02.360]  to policies implemented by Roosevelt against people of Japanese German and
[04:02.360 --> 04:07.640]  Italian descent during World War two and that's just it you can't cover up an
[04:07.640 --> 04:13.640]  invasion of 72% male Syrian refugees into foreign lands where women are being
[04:13.640 --> 04:18.160]  raped at epidemic levels and jihad attacks are brandishing a foothold in

[05:12.160 --> 05:15.840]  that has been part of the global governance plan they've kept it quiet
[05:15.840 --> 05:21.120]  but now they're talking about it openly your food is on the austerity menu we're
[05:21.120 --> 05:25.200]  being told now that livestock beef pork chicken etc create as much greenhouse
[05:25.200 --> 05:30.840]  gas as all the cars planes ships and other transportation combined but don't
[05:30.840 --> 05:34.880]  worry the carbon billionaires already have a solution for their fantasy

[08:27.480 --> 08:41.480]  a little bit better than I used to be because I'm alive live wire good way
[08:41.480 --> 08:45.320]  to describe this worldwide broadcast reaching 20 plus million people a week
[08:45.320 --> 08:49.440]  extremely conservatively our Facebook mentions reached over two and a half
[08:49.440 --> 08:54.520]  million this weekend three videos I did again I'm not bragging I'm just letting
[08:54.520 --> 09:01.040]  you know that the info war is hotter than a red hot poking iron and we're
[09:01.040 --> 09:06.400]  putting it right in the Cyclopsian globalist eyeball every single day
[09:06.400 --> 09:12.920]  first off I am not here to defend Donald Trump just because he's familiar with
[09:12.920 --> 09:19.480]  the show and comes on the broadcast and you know said favorable things I defend
[09:19.480 --> 09:23.240]  Donald Trump because the entire establishment is lined up against him
[09:23.240 --> 09:30.240]  Republican and Democrat and they misconstrue and spin basically 99% of
[09:30.240 --> 09:33.840]  what he has to say he does make some other statements about the internet
[09:33.840 --> 09:39.160]  and censoring it to stop ISIS that I think is really dangerous but when he
[09:39.160 --> 09:42.480]  made statements about bringing refugees in a few months ago I and others said
[09:42.480 --> 09:47.520]  it was horrible he got educated on it and changed his view now if he continues
[09:47.520 --> 09:52.440]  to push this internet censorship stuff I'll have a big problem but separate from
[09:52.440 --> 09:56.200]  that who do we have on the other side Bernie Sanders Hillary Clinton and then
[09:56.200 --> 10:03.080]  the Republican side with Lindsey Graham calling him a hate-filled bigot and
[10:03.080 --> 10:07.840]  he's not qualified to run for president when he doesn't even show up in the
[10:07.840 --> 10:14.360]  single digits hardly and he's completely compromised and openly backed al-Qaeda
[10:14.360 --> 10:21.400]  al-Nusra what is ISIS today with John McCain in Syria so he is one of the
[10:21.400 --> 10:24.920]  main culprits of this we wrote a big story about it yesterday world net daily
[10:24.920 --> 10:30.200]  is reporting on it as well today kill Trump in rage left calls for
[10:30.200 --> 10:36.200]  assassination critics demand death for GOP front-runner after Muslim remarks and
[10:36.200 --> 10:41.520]  all Trump said was if we can't vet these people and Congress won't do their job
[10:41.520 --> 10:45.600]  and they're letting people come in and mass we've got to shut it down for a
[10:45.600 --> 10:51.240]  little while until we figure out what's going on they've had many cases of health
[10:51.240 --> 10:55.200]  departments with the water supply with a deadly fungus or another poison in it
[10:55.200 --> 10:59.800]  and they just shut the water off with the bacteria or something they say boil
[10:59.800 --> 11:05.280]  your water it can make you sick but when it's deadly poison they shut it off now
[11:05.280 --> 11:10.040]  maybe one tenth of one you know millionth of a percent is the fungus
[11:10.040 --> 11:13.320]  they've had this happen a bunch of last few years killing a lot of people in
[11:13.320 --> 11:19.000]  Ohio and West Virginia and California you see up the news hundred sick dozens
[11:19.000 --> 11:25.880]  dead and they shut the water off so if you have 25 percent in international
[11:25.880 --> 11:31.800]  polls 21 percent and other polls of Syrians and refugees basically invaders
[11:31.800 --> 11:37.960]  into Syria usurpers saying they support ISIS they support jihad in the west do
[11:37.960 --> 11:42.720]  you bring in unvetted these people when they've come from terror training camps
[11:42.720 --> 11:48.960]  like jihad Malik last week was San Bernardino no the answer is you shut it
[11:48.960 --> 11:54.080]  off and so we're in an info war and globalists want to get rid of our
[11:54.080 --> 11:58.400]  borders well front-page magazine has an article we've copied the whole thing so
[11:58.400 --> 12:04.400]  it gets out to even more people upon info wars.com Carter banned Iranians from
[12:04.400 --> 12:09.400]  coming to the US during hostage crisis Trump is just like Hitler or Jimmy
[12:09.400 --> 12:13.080]  Carter and that's their sarcastic headline fine they're the ones that
[12:13.080 --> 12:18.280]  pointed this out good job front-page magazine but I'm gonna have Watson kind
[12:18.280 --> 12:21.560]  of redo the article and actually show screenshots of the presidential
[12:21.560 --> 12:25.640]  declaration the presidential order and just have the headline that we put up
[12:25.640 --> 12:30.200]  on Twitter Jimmy Carter agreed with Trump blocked Muslims from entering US
[12:30.200 --> 12:34.080]  and deported in mass because that's what's in the article and what's in the
[12:34.080 --> 12:39.760]  original stories from 1970 1980 when you go look them up is he had tens of
[12:39.760 --> 12:45.360]  thousands of Iranian students who were here on visas for education called in
[12:45.360 --> 12:48.640]  and if they violated their visa in any way which most of them did they were
[12:48.640 --> 12:57.000]  held and deported now let's be clear what Trump is saying is what any other
[12:57.000 --> 13:02.120]  country in history would do if you came here from Italy or you came here from
[13:02.120 --> 13:09.040]  Japan or you came here from Africa 100 years ago you came here from Mexico if
[13:09.040 --> 13:14.440]  you came in through Ellis Island they kept you there three months to check
[13:14.440 --> 13:18.680]  the international most wanted list to write letters back to the country where
[13:18.680 --> 13:23.000]  you came from to check on you to see if you're a wanted person and to check to
[13:23.000 --> 13:29.040]  see if you have diseases like the plague tuberculosis the list goes on and on so
[13:29.040 --> 13:34.040]  this idea that oh you you get here we don't even check your ID or find out who
[13:34.040 --> 13:39.480]  you are or you're chopping the head off of Lady Liberty that's the cartoon they've
[13:39.480 --> 13:44.880]  had going around of Donald Trump is Donald Trump on the cover of New York
[13:44.880 --> 13:49.520]  Daily News cutting the head off of the Statue of Liberty the same New York
[13:49.520 --> 13:54.400]  Daily News of course two days ago said that Christians particularly one
[13:54.400 --> 14:00.720]  Christian who was vocal about his faith basically deserved to die and were
[14:00.720 --> 14:05.440]  bigoted terrorist and is not listed amongst the dead but listed with the
[14:05.440 --> 14:10.320]  shooters there's the headline New York Daily News cover shows Donald Trump
[14:10.320 --> 14:15.120]  beheading Statue of Liberty so it is fitting the Statue of Liberty was to be
[14:15.120 --> 14:21.600]  a woman in a headdress in a burqa a full burqa not just a hajib or hajab or
[14:21.600 --> 14:27.440]  how do you pronounce it entering the Nile River there at Cairo that is what
[14:27.440 --> 14:33.160]  it was built to be it's why folks point out that it looks manly because it was
[14:33.160 --> 14:42.360]  meant to be unisex because originally the face was to be covered so there you
[14:42.360 --> 14:45.160]  have it and there's some other twists to that story I'm gonna be covering a
[14:45.160 --> 14:51.560]  little bit later in the broadcast but we have the big Trump insider on tomorrow
[14:51.560 --> 14:56.600]  and of course that's Roger Stone who was the head of his campaign in his
[14:56.600 --> 15:01.680]  exploratory committee four years ago and who was one of the top people in his
[15:01.680 --> 15:06.800]  campaign until he resigned from the campaign so that he could do more on
[15:06.800 --> 15:13.040]  his own on Bill Maher and CNN and Fox and in this show and others and has been
[15:13.040 --> 15:16.280]  one of the most effective people I seen in Discovery Channel documentaries
[15:16.280 --> 15:20.680]  about Trump I just I turn on the television every once in a while and it
[15:20.680 --> 15:26.760]  seems I see Stone out there he'll be joining us for a full hour and a half
[15:26.760 --> 15:31.080]  tomorrow to to to really delve into Donald Trump because he's on Donald Trump
[15:31.080 --> 15:35.760]  for decades Trump's been talking around for president since since Bush senior in
[15:35.760 --> 15:43.880]  1988 and of course Stone was one of the top advisors to Ronald Reagan and Stone
[15:43.880 --> 15:49.760]  worked in pretty much clandestine operations with elections pro-America
[15:49.760 --> 15:53.600]  elections in the third world he's a big insider when he starts coming out and
[15:53.600 --> 15:57.800]  saying the Bushes deal drugs and the government murdered Kennedy if it
[15:57.800 --> 16:03.040]  stands that's that's Trump's advisor that's pretty much one of his main
[16:03.040 --> 16:06.640]  advisors and they're just waiting for the media to take debate and attack him
[16:06.640 --> 16:11.360]  because Trump really wants to be thrown on that briar patch now a lot of his
[16:11.360 --> 16:14.720]  other campaign staff and people that are more orthodox don't but see they're not
[16:14.720 --> 16:18.560]  running the show if they were running the show Donald Trump wouldn't be in the
[16:18.560 --> 16:24.760]  lead right now they're talking about banning Donald Trump from England you're
[16:24.760 --> 16:28.120]  like oh that won't happen Michael Sabbage is for simply saying that many
[16:28.120 --> 16:31.840]  elements of radical Islam are not compatible with the West the mayor of
[16:31.840 --> 16:38.000]  London who is basically a liberal minion of radical Islam very bizarre
[16:38.000 --> 16:42.680]  character restricts everybody else's free speech calls for bans all sorts of
[16:42.680 --> 16:47.080]  basic freedom but then says Muslims are above the law protected group it's all
[16:47.080 --> 16:50.920]  just political jockeying political manipulation he's come out and said
[16:50.920 --> 16:57.440]  that Trump is a liar there are no no-go zones in London we were there there
[16:57.440 --> 17:04.840]  are we were in Paris there are we were in our reporters on video were in
[17:04.840 --> 17:09.280]  Brussels Belgium and Biggs has been blown up a two armored vehicle shot and
[17:09.280 --> 17:13.600]  hit with shrapnel several times that's on record and you know magazines that
[17:13.600 --> 17:17.680]  were following him embedded when this happened Rolling Stone Esquire you name
[17:17.680 --> 17:22.480]  it and he said he was more scared in Brussels Belgium and felt more of a
[17:22.480 --> 17:26.680]  threat than than his average day in Afghanistan or Iraq and just everywhere
[17:26.680 --> 17:29.600]  they went they would just scream at him and say get out of here you're not
[17:29.600 --> 17:35.160]  wanted and men in cars would follow him threatening them and screaming at him
[17:35.160 --> 17:38.880]  and don't come in our gas station don't come in our restaurant don't come in our
[17:38.880 --> 17:44.800]  five and dime don't come in our facility don't come in our convenience store
[17:44.800 --> 17:51.160]  basically they had to drive miles and miles away just to get food or just to
[17:51.160 --> 17:57.040]  go in and buy some water and it's on record the French police and the Belgium
[17:57.040 --> 18:04.200]  police don't go in those areas and it's admitted in London so they just sit
[18:04.200 --> 18:08.720]  there and lie about it but you can't lie about it forever
[18:08.720 --> 18:13.480]  Carter banned Iranians from coming to the US during hostage crisis since up on
[18:13.480 --> 18:17.760]  infowars.com Trump was a monster a madman of all races he just like Hitler
[18:17.760 --> 18:23.320]  or Jimmy Carter writes that Daniel Greenfeld during the Iranian hostage
[18:23.320 --> 18:26.760]  crisis Carter issued a number of orders to put pressure on Iran among those
[18:26.760 --> 18:31.600]  Iranians were banned from entering the United States unless they opposed the
[18:31.600 --> 18:36.440]  Shiite Islamist regime or had a medical emergency yeah you've got to openly be
[18:36.440 --> 18:40.760]  against it or you can't come in well that's what we're saying now is Japan
[18:40.760 --> 18:46.560]  will not let Wahhabist in for over 25 years fact Japan has no Islamic terror
[18:46.560 --> 18:51.560]  problem ever and the lowest crime rate after Switzerland in the world probably
[18:51.560 --> 18:57.040]  even lower than Switzerland and they just Japan admits and says you can read the
[18:57.040 --> 19:02.400]  article in infowars.com quotes from the Japanese government it says that
[19:02.400 --> 19:07.000]  Islam has not been found to be compatible with our orderly society and
[19:07.000 --> 19:14.440]  just doesn't comport with Japan and by the way Japan's pretty open and
[19:14.440 --> 19:18.400]  liberal about your freedoms but they will not let Muslims pray in public in
[19:18.400 --> 19:22.640]  Japan you will be deported if you're caught doing it now they haven't had
[19:22.640 --> 19:27.480]  the Islamic terror they're super liberal have a peace pact of non-aggression
[19:27.480 --> 19:34.000]  treaty and Japan will not let Muslims into their country pretty much period
[19:34.000 --> 19:37.560]  now I'm not saying we should do that I think that's too extreme of a response
[19:37.560 --> 19:42.120]  but but Islam is in a very radical cycle right now and is being bullied by
[19:42.120 --> 19:46.840]  radicals into extreme radical behavior and they're bringing these people in
[19:46.840 --> 19:51.000]  here to create a cultural crisis and to take our freedoms and Donald Trump is
[19:51.000 --> 19:54.880]  right to say until the problem is fixed until they're being vetted you cannot
[19:54.880 --> 20:03.120]  bring anybody in shut the borders down entirely earthquake floods winter

[20:15.160 --> 20:19.440]  considered heat storage I'm talking about staying warm in the cold here are

[20:23.600 --> 20:27.200]  answers are firewood coal or propane but the problem with that if you need to be
[20:27.200 --> 20:32.320]  on the move is you can't take it with you another concern there may come a time
[20:32.320 --> 20:36.080]  when you need to stay warm without smoke like in times of war there may even
[20:36.080 --> 20:40.680]  come a time when you can't burn fuel the answers may be simpler and less costly

[26:20.080 --> 26:23.960]  come out saying Trump's playing right in the hands of ISIS know who played in
[26:23.960 --> 26:26.960]  the hands of ISIS was Hillary Clinton at the State Department four and a half
[26:26.960 --> 26:29.600]  years ago that gave them the stinger missiles the heavy weapons the tow
[26:29.600 --> 26:33.840]  missiles and continues to do so hoping the public stays ignorant about that
[26:33.840 --> 26:37.720]  which is not happening but here is Hillary claiming that Trump's playing
[26:37.720 --> 26:42.920]  into their hands blowing up their oil trucks that they're selling and making
[26:42.920 --> 26:49.760]  money with with Turkey instead of showing leadership some candidates in this
[26:49.760 --> 26:58.800]  race are resorting to ugly hateful rhetoric Donald Trump the Republican
[26:58.800 --> 27:05.800]  frontrunner has made a name for himself in the last month by trafficking in
[27:05.800 --> 27:15.360]  prejudice and paranoia his latest insult is his call to stop all Muslims from
[27:15.360 --> 27:23.040]  entering the United States this is both a shameless and a dangerous idea at a
[27:23.040 --> 27:29.240]  time when America should be doing everything we can to lead the fight to
[27:29.240 --> 27:37.280]  defeat ISIS and other radical jihadists Donald Trump is playing right into their
[27:37.280 --> 27:45.120]  hands she actually talks like a robot to people you will do as I say your planet
[27:45.120 --> 27:54.960]  is under my control how dare Donald Trump want to close the borders I am the
[27:54.960 --> 28:00.360]  leader of ISIS Hillary Clinton our destabilization force is being defeated

[28:37.400 --> 28:41.680]  they say that Hillary normally goes around and talks whatever accent if
[28:41.680 --> 28:46.120]  she's in New York should be like it's good to be here's with you today my
[28:46.120 --> 28:50.200]  name is a Don Corleone or she's out in California to a Latino crowd she will
[28:50.200 --> 28:56.040]  literally go hello good to be here with you and then if she's in Kentucky she's
[28:56.040 --> 28:59.080]  cut back because of press coverage of this but when she was in Kentucky was the
[28:59.080 --> 29:06.720]  best and this you're talking like a donkey or something trying to go on
[29:06.720 --> 29:12.480]  yeah yeah yeah yeah I mean literally can we find her in Kentucky I ain't been
[29:12.480 --> 29:18.680]  nowhere dumb I mean can you imagine if you went spoke to a bunch of coal miners
[29:18.680 --> 29:23.760]  in Kentucky and I mean sure they have a thick accent kind of idea you know and
[29:23.760 --> 29:27.120]  then you went hi I'm Alex Jones I talked with the Texas accent but said I'm
[29:27.120 --> 29:32.480]  gonna go good to be here with you I mean who would buy into that or if I if I

[29:38.160 --> 29:44.040]  mean it is so insulting and the now she just talks in robot voice I am Hillary
[29:44.040 --> 29:48.920]  Clinton your planet is ours and over your women I love them we're on the March
[29:48.920 --> 29:54.240]  the Empire's on the run a big news coming on Alex Jones and the GCN radio
[29:54.240 --> 30:00.480]  network I'm a proud Muslim but you don't
[30:00.480 --> 30:04.520]  have to share my faith to share my disgust that was written by Hillary
[30:04.520 --> 30:08.400]  Clinton's right-hand woman Huma Abedin who penned the email in response to
[30:08.400 --> 30:12.080]  Donald Trump's recent proposition to impose a complete and total shutdown of
[30:12.080 --> 30:15.560]  Muslims entering the United States you know it was the FBI director the head
[30:15.560 --> 30:18.760]  of counterterrorism and Homeland Security who all said under oath that
[30:18.760 --> 30:22.760]  they cannot properly vet people coming in from Syria but let's take a look at
[30:22.760 --> 30:27.240]  Ms. Abedin back in 2012 five Republicans sent a letter to the Department of
[30:27.240 --> 30:31.200]  Homeland Security noting that three of her family members had very close ties
[30:31.200 --> 30:34.840]  to the Muslim Brotherhood she was also intimately involved in Hillary Clinton's
[30:34.840 --> 30:38.600]  email scandal and while she was at the State Department Ms. Abedin helped our
[30:38.600 --> 30:42.440]  country cozy up to a chic Yusuf al-Khawardi a promoter of jihadist
[30:42.440 --> 30:45.280]  terror and one of her many accomplishments while at the State
[30:45.280 --> 30:48.520]  Department was helping destroy the country of Libya I'm sure her and her
[30:48.520 --> 30:52.000]  Muslim Brotherhood friends are very proud of that achievement just imagine
[30:52.000 --> 30:55.200]  what she can do in her best how Hillary Clinton gets into the White House

[34:41.520 --> 34:45.360]  talking to hispanic audiences that are really crazy
[34:45.360 --> 34:48.720]  but again it just shows a mindset you think donald trump when he shows up
[34:48.720 --> 34:51.360]  to speak to different audiences or if he goes to russia
[34:51.360 --> 34:52.640]  or to germany
[34:52.640 --> 34:54.120]  or to japan
[34:54.120 --> 34:56.560]  does he show up in japan and circling
[34:56.560 --> 34:58.240]  oh very good to see you
[34:58.240 --> 35:02.040]  i am donald trump or does he show up in russia and say
[35:02.040 --> 35:04.840]  it is very nice to meet you vladimir putin
[35:04.840 --> 35:06.240]  i mean this is
[35:06.240 --> 35:09.840]  this this shows this this weird manipulation
[35:09.840 --> 35:12.120]  how these people see themselves as actors
[35:12.120 --> 35:15.000]  but don't even really know how the world really works
[35:15.000 --> 35:17.600]  foreigners particularly just like a
[35:17.600 --> 35:20.160]  profit isn't known as own country
[35:20.160 --> 35:22.920]  like the fact that people sound different and look different and act
[35:22.920 --> 35:23.480]  different
[35:23.480 --> 35:26.480]  the truth is folks like that it's exotic
[35:26.480 --> 35:29.040]  if it's not taking something from
[35:29.040 --> 35:30.960]  people actually don't want you to be
[35:30.960 --> 35:34.600]  coming up to them acting like you're them because you certainly don't know how
[35:34.600 --> 35:37.600]  to act like them and you've dumbed it down to some idiotic
[35:37.600 --> 35:40.000]  stereotype
[35:40.000 --> 35:43.880]  now speaking of vladimir putin and russia here is some big news one of the
[35:43.880 --> 35:45.280]  reasons doctor group
[35:45.280 --> 35:48.880]  uh... one of our health advisers is here in studio with us today
[35:48.880 --> 35:51.720]  uh... on this live wednesday the ninth day of December twenty fifteen
[35:51.720 --> 35:52.960]  transmission
[35:52.960 --> 35:53.680]  putin
[35:53.680 --> 35:56.640]  wants russia to become world's biggest exporter
[35:56.640 --> 35:59.000]  of non-gmo food
[35:59.000 --> 36:01.080]  there is already such a drive in europe
[36:01.080 --> 36:03.240]  in the united states i read the trade publications
[36:03.240 --> 36:06.080]  that they can't supply enough of it
[36:06.080 --> 36:09.760]  and so they in the last five years have banned gmo being brought in
[36:09.760 --> 36:11.920]  so that's glyphosate in it you name it
[36:11.920 --> 36:13.920]  has all these secret stack traits in it
[36:13.920 --> 36:15.280]  kill farm animals and
[36:15.280 --> 36:18.560]  deform them and made their young i mean that's on record
[36:18.560 --> 36:20.920]  that this is a really good move for russia
[36:20.920 --> 36:24.280]  but of course the u.s. will try to ban them shipping organics and they want to
[36:24.280 --> 36:26.360]  make sure we eat the right thing
[36:26.360 --> 36:29.600]  separately monsanto is counter-suing uh...
[36:29.600 --> 36:31.000]  different governments
[36:31.000 --> 36:33.920]  and groups that are bringing up the fact that that's been linked in so many
[36:33.920 --> 36:35.080]  studies to
[36:35.080 --> 36:39.120]  cancer of the liver of the pancreas of the kidneys
[36:39.120 --> 36:43.320]  uh... of especially the bladder
[36:43.320 --> 36:46.800]  i mean who didn't know we killers good for you i mean they're p r people said
[36:46.800 --> 36:48.760]  so but they won't make it themselves
[36:48.760 --> 36:50.080]  by the way don't drink it
[36:50.080 --> 36:52.440]  in informers use it to commit suicide
[36:52.440 --> 36:54.960]  you want to go by by drinking glass of it you're going to be
[36:54.960 --> 36:57.560]  bare minimum see a little green men and vomiting and
[36:57.560 --> 37:00.920]  reducing your life expectancy by decades and probably going to be a
[37:00.920 --> 37:03.680]  going by by so if you want to go six feet under
[37:03.680 --> 37:05.640]  i mean that that's healthy then
[37:05.640 --> 37:09.240]  you want to crawl into the grave and start pushing some little daisies up and
[37:09.240 --> 37:11.680]  it just be flyover country folks drive by
[37:11.680 --> 37:15.080]  you want to skip the next twenty thirty forty fifty sixty seventy eight years
[37:15.080 --> 37:16.240]  of your life
[37:16.240 --> 37:20.320]  by all means listen to them and drink up but it'll kill you down in a hammer
[37:20.320 --> 37:23.400]  so cyanide now i know that's a conspiracy theory and a lot of folks
[37:23.400 --> 37:24.280]  think of i
[37:24.280 --> 37:26.000]  say women one day you know
[37:26.000 --> 37:27.960]  used to give babies uh... you know
[37:27.960 --> 37:28.680]  milk
[37:28.680 --> 37:30.800]  to their mammary glands that mammals are known
[37:30.800 --> 37:32.000]  for having hair and milk
[37:32.000 --> 37:34.280]  it's true but they're gonna start saying that's not real
[37:34.280 --> 37:35.320]  i'm not joking
[37:35.320 --> 37:38.800]  they're gonna start saying vaginal birth never happened it's a conspiracy theory
[37:38.800 --> 37:41.680]  already fifty-some percent is cesarean they're trying to
[37:41.680 --> 37:44.720]  restricted not like your weird if you want to have a vaginal birth
[37:44.720 --> 37:47.960]  this is all part of putting us into this unnatural world
[37:47.960 --> 37:50.600]  so for the next forty five minutes or so dr group
[37:50.600 --> 37:53.560]  uh... joins us in studio than lord monkin from paris
[37:53.560 --> 37:56.040]  on the key world government conference we're following

[38:13.080 --> 38:15.680]  and cover the putin news and the
[38:15.680 --> 38:19.160]  other news you have breaking news
[38:19.160 --> 38:22.400]  that you're gonna cover first that you discovered what's going in children's
[38:22.400 --> 38:26.560]  mouths is so-called additives and no one else has ever reported this that we
[38:26.560 --> 38:28.320]  know of this is just one more
[38:28.320 --> 38:31.600]  crazy town thing that's going on the good news is
[38:31.600 --> 38:33.800]  as this stuff gets exposed
[38:33.800 --> 38:36.040]  companies are pulling it out of their products
[38:36.040 --> 38:39.240]  so the good news is sunlight is the disinfectant
[38:39.240 --> 38:40.560]  uh... for
[38:40.560 --> 38:43.520]  these little globalist frankenberry these little franken
[38:43.520 --> 38:47.160]  frankensteins they've got running a month but first off
[38:47.160 --> 38:50.720]  you developed about a year and a half ago deep cleanse for us took six months
[38:50.720 --> 38:52.960]  to bring it to market this is a plug folks
[38:52.960 --> 38:55.480]  free shipping until december eighteenth
[38:55.480 --> 38:58.320]  get great products and find the tip of the spear in the info or you can't beat
[38:58.320 --> 38:59.440]  that
[38:59.440 --> 39:00.600]  deep cleanse
[39:00.600 --> 39:04.200]  is our best-selling product if we could keep it stock i know
[39:04.200 --> 39:07.920]  you couldn't get the organic trilogy for four or five months we were out of it
[39:07.920 --> 39:10.600]  uh... then we keep selling out of it so fast for the first time we're
[39:10.600 --> 39:11.800]  discounting it
[39:11.800 --> 39:14.480]  even though it's selling out i just want to go further
[39:14.480 --> 39:16.320]  this holiday christmas season
[39:16.320 --> 39:18.760]  seventeen percent off it's our big special
[39:18.760 --> 39:22.080]  that's going to have to end in the next few days because we'll just sell out too
[39:22.080 --> 39:23.360]  quick if we don't i don't
[39:23.360 --> 39:26.120]  we won't get more of this in until probably february or so
[39:26.120 --> 39:28.040]  so i don't want to sell out of it
[39:28.040 --> 39:31.960]  uh... need to keep it stock that's not good for products always be sold out but
[39:31.960 --> 39:35.920]  it's so popular without me ever really plugging it or promoting it
[39:35.920 --> 39:39.000]  like x2 or super malvitality that i think are just
[39:39.000 --> 39:42.720]  just as amazing but with the big
[39:42.720 --> 39:44.240]  groups out there
[39:44.240 --> 39:46.640]  uh... with the foodies with the
[39:46.640 --> 39:49.480]  nutraceutical experts with the hippies
[39:49.480 --> 39:51.600]  this is a a original
[39:51.600 --> 39:54.560]  proprietary product you made just for us deep cleanse
[39:54.560 --> 39:59.160]  why is this so incredibly popular not just with my audience but we have the
[39:59.160 --> 40:02.280]  metrics all these people that aren't our audience
[40:02.280 --> 40:04.040]  with this one product
[40:04.040 --> 40:07.160]  well oxy powder too but that's not proprietary you have that as well you
[40:07.160 --> 40:07.840]  invented it
[40:07.840 --> 40:10.400]  are coming in info wars store dot com
[40:10.400 --> 40:12.500]  info wars life dot com
[40:12.500 --> 40:17.400]  and just buying us out of this and now that you are able uh... through the
[40:17.400 --> 40:19.720]  big or biology lab
[40:19.720 --> 40:23.760]  uh... that's so famous and well-known in utah to up their production
[40:23.760 --> 40:28.040]  had to expand their factory because they make this product group designed it
[40:28.040 --> 40:31.000]  we this will probably be our best-selling product if we continue to
[40:31.000 --> 40:32.080]  keep it stock
[40:32.080 --> 40:34.440]  why is it such a
[40:34.440 --> 40:36.200]  secret success without
[40:36.200 --> 40:38.080]  a promotion of the group
[40:38.080 --> 40:41.280]  uh... it's a product that i'm real proud of and it took a long time to develop
[40:41.280 --> 40:43.960]  and it's actually a souped up
[40:43.960 --> 40:48.120]  fluoride shield you know we used to have the product for fluoride and when we
[40:48.120 --> 40:51.400]  looked at the root cause of disease what's happening with everybody self
[40:51.400 --> 40:54.880]  healing mechanism being suppressed were coming into the holiday season now where
[40:54.880 --> 40:56.840]  people are going to be consuming
[40:56.840 --> 41:00.520]  two or three times the amount of sugar and toxins and everything else for the
[41:00.520 --> 41:02.680]  next few months they're going to be gaining weight they're going to be
[41:02.680 --> 41:05.120]  deficient in vitamin d
[41:05.120 --> 41:07.880]  what we did is a matter of fact the fluoride uh... poison on tap
[41:07.880 --> 41:11.280]  documentary that you guys put on your website a couple months ago actually has
[41:11.280 --> 41:14.880]  the fluoride shield in the documentary so for anyone out there i know with the
[41:14.880 --> 41:18.240]  you guys have been getting a lot of questions on that the deep cleanse
[41:18.240 --> 41:22.800]  is a replacement for the fluoride shield but it goes above it's just more
[41:22.800 --> 41:26.120]  concentrated and has more shellage explain what has happened because we we
[41:26.120 --> 41:30.200]  focus on intestinal cleansing liver and gallbladder cleansing harmful organism
[41:30.200 --> 41:34.040]  cleansing and then chemical and toxic metal cleansing and that's what the deep
[41:34.040 --> 41:34.880]  cleanse
[41:34.880 --> 41:39.680]  is designed to do that's designed to bond and help the body naturally
[41:39.680 --> 41:40.880]  eliminate
[41:40.880 --> 41:44.360]  all the chemicals and toxins that you're going to get whether it's from
[41:44.360 --> 41:45.640]  fragrances
[41:45.640 --> 41:46.960]  cosmetics
[41:46.960 --> 41:48.200]  plastics
[41:48.200 --> 41:51.240]  uh... the water supply that people are taking in with all the chemicals and
[41:51.240 --> 41:54.560]  com and it tastes like nothing you've ever tasted with all these different
[41:54.560 --> 41:55.840]  essential oils
[41:55.840 --> 41:58.040]  and different compounds and zeolites
[41:58.040 --> 42:00.680]  and organic shellage it tastes good
[42:00.680 --> 42:03.920]  but you think you've tasted everything and then you taste this it tastes like
[42:03.920 --> 42:04.680]  nothing
[42:04.680 --> 42:08.200]  i've ever tasted not an amazing product and uh...
[42:08.200 --> 42:11.640]  you know we we actually get some shit to us and i take the product i take
[42:11.640 --> 42:13.480]  everything that we develop but
[42:13.480 --> 42:17.600]  we've had so many good responses from people taking the deep cleanse and it
[42:17.600 --> 42:22.200]  really is what it what it says on the label it's designed to deeply cleanse
[42:22.200 --> 42:23.920]  all of the chemicals
[42:23.920 --> 42:28.360]  and toxic metals assist your body in doing that and we use rare ingredients
[42:28.360 --> 42:31.440]  like you mentioned the shellage which is hand harvested
[42:31.440 --> 42:35.240]  up in the Himalayan mountains and that's a combination of minerals and
[42:35.240 --> 42:38.600]  folvic blends from decomposed plant material
[42:38.600 --> 42:41.720]  for sellout is the shellage you know we don't know exactly but
[42:41.720 --> 42:44.800]  i mean they say that most oil isn't really
[42:44.800 --> 42:47.400]  uh... fossil based uh... it's
[42:47.400 --> 42:48.280]  it's it's
[42:48.280 --> 42:51.600]  i guess that's a biotic that's being proven but this truly is
[42:51.600 --> 42:53.640]  a fossil oil correct
[42:53.640 --> 42:58.280]  uh... it's it's more of a resin and it's the decomposition of
[42:58.280 --> 43:01.920]  depending on where the mountain is they might have fifty seventy even a hundred
[43:01.920 --> 43:05.600]  different medicinal plants growing in that area of the mountain
[43:05.600 --> 43:09.040]  and as they decompose these plants of perennial means they their root
[43:09.040 --> 43:12.640]  structure stays there and they regrow every year but they decompose part of
[43:12.640 --> 43:16.240]  the plant the leaves fall on the oil concentrates and it keeps working its
[43:16.240 --> 43:21.040]  way down down down into the mountain and after let's say seven or ten years
[43:21.040 --> 43:24.560]  maybe even more than that so it's more like amber it's more like amber
[43:24.560 --> 43:29.360]  it's like a thick amber resin except it's a dark brown black color so
[43:29.360 --> 43:32.920]  deep cleanse is something look we just can't get away from all the chemicals
[43:32.920 --> 43:36.360]  and toxins that were exposed to on a daily basis and one of the russians
[43:36.360 --> 43:37.560]  back in the olympics
[43:37.560 --> 43:40.880]  uh... people kept they kept testing them and they weren't on drugs
[43:40.880 --> 43:42.280]  but they were on shilligy
[43:42.280 --> 43:45.800]  that's what it was yes that was a performance enhancing
[43:45.800 --> 43:49.400]  it's not a performance enhancing drug because it comes from the earth it's
[43:49.400 --> 43:53.600]  all natural but what that does is it gives you all the necessary
[43:53.600 --> 43:59.200]  vitamins and mineral would you say on average it's as in
[43:59.200 --> 44:00.760]  performance enhancing
[44:00.760 --> 44:04.200]  as say a supermold totality is a totally different
[44:04.200 --> 44:09.480]  it's different in the in the fact that it's designed to help your body
[44:09.480 --> 44:13.600]  key late or bond to why were the russians taking it still taking
[44:13.600 --> 44:17.040]  well because if your body's clean which is what we talk about all the time then
[44:17.040 --> 44:20.640]  your hormones work if you're not putting the endocrine disrupting chemicals in
[44:20.640 --> 44:23.120]  that are actually suppressing your hormones
[44:23.120 --> 44:27.040]  and increasing your estrogen and causing hormonal imbalance
[44:27.040 --> 44:30.000]  and your body's clean and free of all these chemicals and toxins these
[44:30.000 --> 44:33.480]  endocrine disrupting chemicals and not only that i mean mercury fillings the
[44:33.480 --> 44:36.000]  list goes on and on and on gluten
[44:36.000 --> 44:40.840]  then your body's ability to produce and regulate the hormones
[44:40.840 --> 44:42.040]  properly
[44:42.040 --> 44:46.360]  is balanced it's all about balance in the shellage did that but not only that
[44:46.360 --> 44:50.240]  the shellage actually stimulates the pituitary gland
[44:50.240 --> 44:55.480]  it helps release the toxic halogens from the
[44:55.480 --> 44:59.600]  uh... thyroid and actually brings the body's endocrine
[44:59.600 --> 45:03.080]  which is your hormone producing system back into battle i haven't gone through
[45:03.080 --> 45:05.600]  a detox taking this like i did x2
[45:05.600 --> 45:07.080]  and you think that's
[45:07.080 --> 45:10.520]  you know it varies person to person group just your gut level you know
[45:10.520 --> 45:13.800]  so many patients so much research dealing with these compounds
[45:13.800 --> 45:17.240]  isn't that already with the detox with the x2 years ago so this didn't make me
[45:17.240 --> 45:18.680]  feel bad
[45:18.680 --> 45:22.240]  or is it that this is just so entirely different that it didn't have that
[45:22.240 --> 45:23.600]  of that effect
[45:23.600 --> 45:26.600]  it depends on what stage your detox you're going through that's why we
[45:26.600 --> 45:29.960]  recommend first doing an intestinal cleanse because you don't want to start
[45:29.960 --> 45:32.840]  taking a bunch of chemicals and toxic compounds
[45:32.840 --> 45:35.640]  into your bloodstream if you're constipated because then it's just going to
[45:35.640 --> 45:37.720]  get dumped into your intestines
[45:37.720 --> 45:41.560]  as you sit there and reabsorb back to the first oxy powder liver
[45:41.560 --> 45:44.720]  shield get your liver clean that out drink a lot of water
[45:44.720 --> 45:48.640]  uh... apple cider vinegar then the next phase then the next phase is is the deep
[45:48.640 --> 45:52.440]  cleanse and cleansing everything out now that's not to say you can still do that
[45:52.440 --> 45:55.920]  well did i start right doing x2 though before i started the deep cleanse did you
[45:55.920 --> 46:00.880]  did you did so x2 first then the deep cleanse then the uh...
[46:00.880 --> 46:02.680]  no no x2
[46:02.680 --> 46:05.200]  then the oxy powder i mean what's the order
[46:05.200 --> 46:09.480]  well the the perfect order would be always focus on your intestines first and
[46:09.480 --> 46:12.120]  that would be oxy powder cleaning your intestines because if you're in test
[46:12.120 --> 46:17.480]  liver shield oxy powder then x2 then deep cleanse oxy powder and
[46:17.480 --> 46:21.280]  liver shield for your liver the two main disease causing organs to get
[46:21.280 --> 46:23.960]  contaminated of the intestinal tract and the liver
[46:23.960 --> 46:27.240]  and so if those two are clean then everything else works really good in
[46:27.240 --> 46:31.120]  the liver is actually able to process okay so it's liver shield oxy powder
[46:31.120 --> 46:37.920]  then it's x2 oxy powder liver shield but x2 could be taken at any time see that
[46:37.920 --> 46:40.320]  doesn't necessarily have to be taken
[46:40.320 --> 46:44.480]  uh... after any particular cleansing programs because the iodine itself will
[46:44.480 --> 46:48.000]  actually bond to some of the toxic halogens and that should come out
[46:48.000 --> 46:49.160]  through your urine
[46:49.160 --> 46:51.120]  so oxy powder liver shield
[46:51.120 --> 46:54.480]  anybody at any time because every cell in the body has iodine receptors on it
[46:54.480 --> 46:57.120]  so it's so it's because i think i was saying it this way but i'm wrong
[46:57.120 --> 46:59.400]  so it's oxy powder liver shield
[46:59.400 --> 47:03.320]  uh... then uh... deep cleanse and x2 can be any time
[47:03.320 --> 47:07.040]  x2 can be any time but usually after the liver shield we want to go with the
[47:07.040 --> 47:10.360]  harmful organism cleansing the living defense
[47:10.360 --> 47:14.040]  and uh... and then just constantly clean your body on a regular basis and then
[47:14.040 --> 47:17.240]  focus on cleaning your environment how often would you take living defense each
[47:17.240 --> 47:19.240]  year
[47:19.240 --> 47:22.520]  i would go through maybe one of course everybody's different that's going to
[47:22.520 --> 47:25.720]  depend on if they're eating a lot of sushi or not but the living defense i
[47:25.720 --> 47:30.280]  would go through at least one harmful organism cleanse every single year
[47:30.280 --> 47:32.640]  okay we've got the oxy powder
[47:32.640 --> 47:36.400]  uh... discounted uh... with the living defense and also discounted with another
[47:36.400 --> 47:37.360]  product
[47:37.360 --> 47:40.960]  uh... the deep cleanse as well there's a huge discount on that right now

[49:16.760 --> 49:19.280]  couldn't pull up anything but
[49:19.280 --> 49:24.320]  uh... what i found was it was it aside from the mercury fillings there are

[50:48.400 --> 50:50.520]  and then we just move on to something just as bad or worse

[54:22.120 --> 54:36.120]  ladies and gentlemen we are broadcasting worldwide we're not just here
[54:36.120 --> 54:42.160]  complaining about the globalists in their system we are taking our country and
[54:42.160 --> 54:47.000]  our world back we are creating our own economies we are promoting what is known
[54:47.000 --> 54:51.160]  to be healthy and safe and alternatives to globalism look at the second
[54:51.160 --> 54:53.960]  amendment culture is taking over they admit that in every metric out there
[54:53.960 --> 54:57.920]  that they've gone from 30 something years ago guns being unpopular to guns
[54:57.920 --> 55:05.720]  now being almost 75% 74 73% positive in this country Roe v. Wade was popular in
[55:05.720 --> 55:13.240]  1974 1973 now it's unpopular the numbers are flipping and regardless we think
[55:13.240 --> 55:17.360]  about abortion itself people now know it's about eugenics it's about body
[55:17.360 --> 55:20.360]  parts it's not about choice do we demonize some woman that's had an
[55:20.360 --> 55:24.360]  abortion and say she's the devil no and a lot of the controlled opposition does
[55:24.360 --> 55:28.720]  that to make it look reasonable we just simply point out we need to value life
[55:28.720 --> 55:33.600]  more and that people can be forgiven for what they've done Lord knows I can Lord
[55:33.600 --> 55:38.120]  knows I'm not perfect I'm not some Pharisee folks up here on my horse just
[55:38.120 --> 55:40.640]  because I'm trying to get back into health the last four or five years and
[55:40.640 --> 55:46.120]  I've lost 70 plus pounds I was really fat doesn't mean I'm Mr. Pretty Boy and
[55:46.120 --> 55:50.880]  have all the answers and I'm up here you know looking down on you we're all in
[55:50.880 --> 55:54.960]  this journey together I'm trying to get folks on this journey Dr. Group you found
[55:54.960 --> 55:59.440]  out some incredible stuff just a little bit of plastic additive bisphenol a I
[55:59.440 --> 56:02.680]  know is a huge endocrine disruptor you have the actual sheets from the dental
[56:02.680 --> 56:05.640]  offices I don't want to single them out they're just getting you know what's
[56:05.640 --> 56:09.480]  accepted normal stuff now to replace mercury but my good is just from when
[56:09.480 --> 56:13.480]  I've researched couldn't this be as bad as mercury tell us about it thought that
[56:13.480 --> 56:16.720]  I knew everything and I thought I had researched everything but it wasn't
[56:16.720 --> 56:21.160]  until my kid had a cavity and needed to be filled that my wife took him to one
[56:21.160 --> 56:25.080]  of the dentist's office and she asked is there an alternative to mercury and they
[56:25.080 --> 56:29.360]  said yes there is and she said well can I see what's in there and so they gave
[56:29.360 --> 56:33.920]  her a data sheet she called me up and she's like do you know that these fillings
[56:33.920 --> 56:39.560]  contain a bunch of toxic ingredients there's two hydroxy ethyl methyl
[56:39.560 --> 56:46.600]  acrylate bisphenol a 10 meth acryl I mean you can't even pronounce these
[56:46.600 --> 56:51.840]  decimal and I'm a scientist dihydrogen phosphate let's zoom in on that but
[56:51.840 --> 56:53.920]  laid out so they can zoom in that's fine right there put it right there for TV
[56:53.920 --> 56:57.720]  viewers yeah right there there was three different types that we found I went to
[56:57.720 --> 57:02.720]  three different dentist's office in the Houston area and got these these that is
[57:02.720 --> 57:07.040]  the hazardous material data sheet they gave you yes it is and that's this one
[57:07.040 --> 57:11.320]  is called clear fill and there's two other ones by 3m that are made by 3m
[57:11.320 --> 57:15.760]  actually there's three other ones made by 3m and they all contain bisphenol a
[57:15.760 --> 57:22.200]  potassium persulfate glycerol dimethylacrylate I mean every single one
[57:22.200 --> 57:27.480]  of these chemicals and this is what they're using to put in kids mouth oh
[57:27.480 --> 57:30.760]  it blows me away as if there was a little bit of it you can see well they
[57:30.760 --> 57:35.000]  needed to bond it but this these have high percentages of this oh and you know
[57:35.000 --> 57:39.360]  this is this is just shocking to me I've never seen anything like this I'm
[57:39.360 --> 57:43.200]  gonna post these on our website and give these to the infowars team to to post as
[57:43.200 --> 57:48.160]  well because this is shocking I thought mercury was bad well your dad was a
[57:48.160 --> 57:52.040]  famous chemist who helped develop his phenol a but no one's denying now what
[57:52.040 --> 57:56.440]  this does I mean this turns this turns male frogs into females females into
[57:56.440 --> 58:00.760]  super females I mean this is not good so they're putting endocrine disrupting
[58:00.760 --> 58:05.880]  chemicals and sterility chemicals in children's mouths when they get cavities
[58:05.880 --> 58:09.280]  and you know the cavity rate is that's the headline chemicals linked to
[58:09.280 --> 58:15.360]  sterility in fillings that's right amazing you will listen when you're off

[01:01:04.360 --> 01:01:08.560]  go ahead and submit to it it doesn't mean I'm for it it's like I fought the
[01:01:08.560 --> 01:01:13.160]  police state now it's here that doesn't mean I support shooting cops in the head
[01:01:13.160 --> 01:01:17.120]  randomly because that's being pushed by the White House they create the crisis
[01:01:17.120 --> 01:01:20.560]  offer the solution even greater crisis but in the short segment I want to come
[01:01:20.560 --> 01:01:24.400]  back into all the super important health news with you doctor group you know
[01:01:24.400 --> 01:01:28.160]  you're an army veteran yourself special operations of patriot kind of liberal on
[01:01:28.160 --> 01:01:31.000]  some issues conservative on others really a libertarian correct me if I'm
[01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:35.720]  wrong but but a trailblazer in in nutraceuticals and other research and
[01:01:35.720 --> 01:01:39.560]  product development so you're an American you know free market guy what
[01:01:39.560 --> 01:01:42.920]  is your view of Donald Trump what do you think about the things he's doing and the
[01:01:42.920 --> 01:01:47.240]  whole system lined up against him well I'm a believer of addressing the root
[01:01:47.240 --> 01:01:52.720]  cause of the problem and government and politics has not ever addressed the root
[01:01:52.720 --> 01:01:56.240]  cause of the million problems that we currently have the FDA doesn't address
[01:01:56.240 --> 01:02:00.080]  the problem the root cause of all the chemicals and disease the pharmaceutical
[01:02:00.080 --> 01:02:05.240]  companies don't address the root cause of the problems in health care all if
[01:02:05.240 --> 01:02:10.400]  you look at all political scenarios out there all they do is put a band-aid on
[01:02:10.400 --> 01:02:14.080]  the problem and it caused the taxpayers and all of us a lot of money and a lot of
[01:02:14.080 --> 01:02:19.560]  time and a lot of stress and a lot of headaches so what I think is Donald Trump
[01:02:19.560 --> 01:02:24.520]  is actually coming out and addressing the root cause of the problem and that's
[01:02:24.520 --> 01:02:28.480]  the only way that you fix things in this world is if you actually take the
[01:02:28.480 --> 01:02:33.560]  time and say okay this is the scenario that we have I mean we all know about
[01:02:33.560 --> 01:02:37.720]  all the false flag attacks and in the government creation of ISIS and in all
[01:02:37.720 --> 01:02:42.560]  of those agendas that we currently have for the New World Order and in the
[01:02:42.560 --> 01:02:46.080]  global control and the with the bankers running everything and the Rothschilds
[01:02:46.080 --> 01:02:49.400]  and the Rockefellers and all that the majority of the population doesn't know
[01:02:49.400 --> 01:02:54.960]  about that that is the root cause of the problem and if we have open borders and
[01:02:54.960 --> 01:02:59.480]  we have people coming in it's only going to affect all of the Americans that are
[01:02:59.480 --> 01:03:05.480]  actually trying to live by the Constitution live by Christianity and
[01:03:05.480 --> 01:03:11.120]  they're actually trying to do a good job and support their country instead of
[01:03:11.120 --> 01:03:15.920]  having you know these other people that are coming in and creating chaos and
[01:03:15.920 --> 01:03:20.400]  threatening our amendment rights to take our guns away I mean you got to look at
[01:03:20.400 --> 01:03:23.400]  the agendas is exactly what you talk about all the time that's it there's an
[01:03:23.400 --> 01:03:28.360]  agenda they're using this to take our freedom it's very far guns from us keep
[01:03:28.360 --> 01:03:34.880]  us sick keep us dumbed down keep us in a state of fear so they can control us I
[01:03:34.880 --> 01:03:41.040]  mean that's just it's all you know socialistic itemized ways isn't Bernie
[01:03:41.040 --> 01:03:46.400]  Sanders scary yes saying saying just put gun owners on list with no proof take
[01:03:46.400 --> 01:03:50.880]  their guns he and saying Donald Trump should shut up you know this isn't how
[01:03:50.880 --> 01:03:54.920]  we do it in America this won't fly Jimmy Carter when we were basically at war
[01:03:54.920 --> 01:03:58.120]  with Iran kicked Iranians out by the tens of thousands and wouldn't let him
[01:03:58.120 --> 01:04:02.000]  come here well they didn't even let Trump finish what he was saying anyway I
[01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:06.960]  mean all the major news agencies cut him off right after he said not to let the
[01:04:06.960 --> 01:04:13.880]  Muslims or Islamic people into the country and you know they just started
[01:04:13.880 --> 01:04:17.800]  that whole ball rolling because Trump is a threat I mean he's a threat to all the
[01:04:17.800 --> 01:04:22.240]  other politicians they know that he might be the one that can come in there
[01:04:22.240 --> 01:04:24.960]  and to actually start stirring things what do you think of him coming on the
[01:04:24.960 --> 01:04:32.320]  show I think that was awesome I mean that was incredible I watched it and it was
[01:04:32.320 --> 01:04:35.840]  you know of course like you said at the end he was gonna get a lot of backlash
[01:04:35.840 --> 01:04:40.000]  and he did but I mean someone look someone needs to stand up I mean we
[01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:44.520]  stand up every single day well he's able to go on every show he wants you know
[01:04:44.520 --> 01:04:50.160]  what I being in being in government and politics is it's very hard to change the
[01:04:50.160 --> 01:04:55.040]  world what we do is change the world he knows that he's breaking the mold that's
[01:04:55.040 --> 01:04:59.520]  right Trump knows about the New World Order folks he does Hillary Clinton wants
[01:04:59.520 --> 01:05:02.840]  to censor people who make fun of her she was recently trying to censor comedy

[01:08:29.960 --> 01:08:48.600]  tonight only I would put your dancing live on air
[01:08:48.600 --> 01:09:02.480]  I was just thinking during the break you've got Putin coming out saying I may
[01:09:02.480 --> 01:09:08.360]  use nukes on ISIS that's to get the harder deeper targets super radical
[01:09:08.360 --> 01:09:11.400]  statement part of operation total destruction I'm not joking that's the
[01:09:11.400 --> 01:09:15.760]  name of the operation with cruise missiles that's the headline Putin
[01:09:15.760 --> 01:09:19.720]  threatens to use nuclear weapons against ISIS but hopes they'll never be
[01:09:19.720 --> 01:09:24.160]  needed leader says new cruise missile can be equipped with nuclear warheads and
[01:09:24.160 --> 01:09:27.800]  conventional warheads that's just saber rattling against the West but he also
[01:09:27.800 --> 01:09:31.440]  comes out and says we want to make our big export non-gmo food we know there's
[01:09:31.440 --> 01:09:34.840]  a huge market which the metrics actually show and I wanted to get to that next
[01:09:34.840 --> 01:09:39.240]  stop and group then all the other articles look at Trump look at Putin it's
[01:09:39.240 --> 01:09:42.680]  not that they're perfect but they know breaking with the system is what's
[01:09:42.680 --> 01:09:47.840]  healthy and it's what's popular all over the world they can't meet the demand
[01:09:47.840 --> 01:09:52.520]  for non-gmo it's super profitable why would our government then be pushing it
[01:09:52.520 --> 01:09:56.560]  on the whole world I mean Africans won't take it they won't take it as food aid
[01:09:56.560 --> 01:09:59.960]  they know what's going on there's Putin wants Russia to become the world's
[01:09:59.960 --> 01:10:04.480]  biggest exporter of non-gmo food we should be but instead they've got all
[01:10:04.480 --> 01:10:07.200]  these regulations and harassment try to shut it down what do you think's
[01:10:07.200 --> 01:10:12.640]  happening dr. Grubb I think that's great for Russia you know Putin's I know
[01:10:12.640 --> 01:10:17.520]  Putin's a listener and I know that he is probably on the leading edge of getting
[01:10:17.520 --> 01:10:21.560]  rid of all the chemicals and actually listening to the people and and with the
[01:10:21.560 --> 01:10:26.400]  health care programs they're putting in place we're going backwards we're going
[01:10:26.400 --> 01:10:33.000]  the US is falling lower and lower and lower in health care in debt and the
[01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:36.320]  amount of toxic chemicals being sprayed on us and in the water system and
[01:10:36.320 --> 01:10:40.760]  everything and there's nothing on the horizon from our government to fix any
[01:10:40.760 --> 01:10:44.200]  of that so for all these other government leaders to step up in these
[01:10:44.200 --> 01:10:49.160]  other countries and to start listening to what the people want and start making
[01:10:49.160 --> 01:10:55.040]  adjustments and pledges to actually clean up the food supply clean up the
[01:10:55.040 --> 01:11:03.120]  water they know they know that this is the way to create a healthy environment
[01:11:03.120 --> 01:11:07.840]  in which we live because the earth is also sick people are sick
[01:11:07.840 --> 01:11:11.800]  unfortunately here in the United States about the soils right there I mean
[01:11:11.800 --> 01:11:16.320]  so there are natural systems that have better yields incredibly alive makes the
[01:11:16.320 --> 01:11:20.440]  soil stick to the earth doesn't wash away that's right we're seeing the
[01:11:20.440 --> 01:11:24.160]  desertification all over the US like Africa now like we're becoming the
[01:11:24.160 --> 01:11:27.400]  Sahara in many areas the country like the Midwest yes we are becoming a
[01:11:27.400 --> 01:11:32.040]  poisoned country we and there's nothing it's just getting worse and worse and
[01:11:32.040 --> 01:11:36.280]  worse more chemicals are being approved there's no oversight by the USDA the
[01:11:36.280 --> 01:11:40.880]  EP but Monsanto said glyphosate is good for you well of course I mean if dying
[01:11:40.880 --> 01:11:45.400]  is good well you know you have to look at the population control factor too I
[01:11:45.400 --> 01:11:50.200]  mean all of this stuff is designed you can take any one of these chemicals
[01:11:50.200 --> 01:11:54.400]  we've done it we've broken down every single one there's 80,000 chemicals that
[01:11:54.400 --> 01:11:58.480]  are they at mainline science admits that glyphosate is an estrogen
[01:11:58.480 --> 01:12:03.760]  mimico and grows many forms of cancer period right at parts per billion
[01:12:03.760 --> 01:12:08.240]  dosages you remember a long time ago we used to go in our grandmother's cupboard
[01:12:08.240 --> 01:12:10.880]  and we'd pull out the flower and sometimes you'd find all those little
[01:12:10.880 --> 01:12:15.160]  bugs in there yeah well I don't know if you've noticed this but no one's seen
[01:12:15.160 --> 01:12:19.400]  any bugs in their flower in the last 10 or 15 years that's right I remember I
[01:12:19.400 --> 01:12:23.240]  remember my mom would have flower in in a week if we didn't eat it there'd be
[01:12:23.240 --> 01:12:27.160]  bugs in there because they had eggs in there and they'd hatch but they can't do
[01:12:27.160 --> 01:12:32.000]  it now because they're dead dead dead people go oh good no bugs no that's the
[01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:35.600]  bottom of the food chain that means that you're dying too that means that the
[01:12:35.600 --> 01:12:39.640]  flower is contaminated with pesticides it's sprayed with pesticides in the
[01:12:39.640 --> 01:12:43.000]  field well they had mentally spray it with fluoride yeah exactly I mean that's
[01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:47.280]  why you don't see bugs in you know flying around in or in your cup in your
[01:12:47.280 --> 01:12:50.600]  cupboard anymore because everything's toxic for bugs I mean if they what about
[01:12:50.600 --> 01:12:55.120]  all the studies out showing that insect levels are plunging well not only are
[01:12:55.120 --> 01:12:59.720]  insect levels plunging but so is the herbs plunging you know we're kind of
[01:12:59.720 --> 01:13:03.680]  you and I are kind of you have the oil and gas industry but you also have the
[01:13:03.680 --> 01:13:07.120]  commodity industry and that's herbs and we do the same thing I mean instead that's
[01:13:07.120 --> 01:13:10.600]  why we're sold out of stuff a lot of the time is we can't get real organic that
[01:13:10.600 --> 01:13:14.320]  will pass California certification do you know a bottle of oxy powder right now
[01:13:14.320 --> 01:13:19.720]  is more expensive than a than a barrel of oil yes and and what does that barrel
[01:13:19.720 --> 01:13:22.640]  of oil do for the environment what does that bottle of oxy powder do for your
[01:13:22.640 --> 01:13:26.840]  health you know so we're over here we're doing instead of drilling we're
[01:13:26.840 --> 01:13:30.440]  farming right so if you look at our industry and you look at the oil and
[01:13:30.440 --> 01:13:33.520]  gas it's basically the same thing they're taking and destroying the earth
[01:13:33.520 --> 01:13:38.240]  but we're growing stuff on the earth we have to move commodities around to we
[01:13:38.240 --> 01:13:40.960]  have different price structure on commodities they have different price
[01:13:40.960 --> 01:13:45.400]  structures on commodities the end result is you either use the the toxic
[01:13:45.400 --> 01:13:51.200]  oil and gas for your car to pollute the environment or you use the natural I
[01:13:51.200 --> 01:13:54.680]  thought of something we ought to send you over I'm serious with a crew for a
[01:13:54.680 --> 01:13:59.080]  week and a half you know paid deal as reporters to go make deals with Russian
[01:13:59.080 --> 01:14:02.840]  farmers I'm serious to supply us with a bunch of our herbs that we can't even
[01:14:02.840 --> 01:14:07.360]  get from America now that's right yeah there's only two biodynamic certified
[01:14:07.360 --> 01:14:11.000]  herb farms in the United States ours is one of them and there's another one
[01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:15.080]  acre farm up in Oregon that's biodynamic certified and that for people who don't
[01:14:15.080 --> 01:14:20.840]  know biodynamic is the old sustainable agricultural permacultural way of
[01:14:20.840 --> 01:14:24.240]  everything comes and a lot of listeners will tune in to us and go away you say
[01:14:24.240 --> 01:14:27.760]  global warming's a fraud Al Gore's a fraud but you're talking all the super
[01:14:27.760 --> 01:14:32.200]  hippie-dippy stuff no keeping your soil alive not having GMO not having heavy
[01:14:32.200 --> 01:14:37.680]  metals in your food is common sense real sustainability they hijack all those
[01:14:37.680 --> 01:14:41.280]  terms and they push it as world government when they're the ones building
[01:14:41.280 --> 01:14:45.440]  new nuclear reactors everywhere on fault lines and the environmental left says
[01:14:45.440 --> 01:14:50.280]  nukes are the answer see everything they say they are it's the opposite I mean
[01:14:50.280 --> 01:14:54.440]  you take the Southern Poverty Law Center the ADL let's take Planned Parenthood
[01:14:54.440 --> 01:14:59.240]  admittedly above the Klan but black people fall down and worship it even
[01:14:59.240 --> 01:15:03.960]  though it's sworn to kill them because TV said so and so the white people I mean
[01:15:03.960 --> 01:15:07.160]  this is the mental illness they're the opposite of what they claim folks is what
[01:15:07.160 --> 01:15:10.480]  we're saying yeah I mean the control over the power grids and everything by the
[01:15:10.480 --> 01:15:14.040]  way I talked to one of the Tesla engineers with that new home battery that
[01:15:14.040 --> 01:15:18.360]  they're coming out with it powers your whole home and with just a small solar
[01:15:18.360 --> 01:15:21.720]  panel we're gonna get them on yeah that's and that's supposed to be released
[01:15:21.720 --> 01:15:24.560]  this summer by the way they've had the government jacking with them I asked
[01:15:24.560 --> 01:15:28.040]  the real environmental stuff they're trying to block real innovation yeah
[01:15:28.040 --> 01:15:31.600]  exactly and I said you really think that they're gonna allow that to be released
[01:15:31.600 --> 01:15:35.240]  and they said it's already in some homes in California and Utah but I'll be real
[01:15:35.240 --> 01:15:40.760]  surprised it's gonna sell for 3,000 3500 and one of these units will power a
[01:15:40.760 --> 01:15:45.840]  4,000 square foot home wow so you know we're starting to see the push for free
[01:15:45.840 --> 01:15:50.720]  energy devices people are you know when you walk on the ground you should
[01:15:50.720 --> 01:15:56.360]  almost feel the ground move because the earth is living it should be living but
[01:15:56.360 --> 01:16:00.840]  when we spray all kinds of chemtrails and we have water that's contaminated with
[01:16:00.840 --> 01:16:04.040]  fluoride and all the chemicals and toxins we've killed off all the soil so
[01:16:04.040 --> 01:16:10.680]  we're killing from the ground up fracking oil drilling minerals all that stuff and
[01:16:10.680 --> 01:16:14.360]  let's go further I told the story last week is they always want to ban this ban
[01:16:14.360 --> 01:16:18.360]  that at the UN German immigrants and others in central Texas brought in
[01:16:18.360 --> 01:16:25.360]  goats 160 years ago or so or 70 years ago now and there were six foot grass oak
[01:16:25.360 --> 01:16:28.440]  trees everywhere they thought they found they called it Valhalla I mean
[01:16:28.440 --> 01:16:31.400]  springs coming out of the rocks everywhere every couple hundred feet it
[01:16:31.400 --> 01:16:36.080]  was crazy the goats will then just 50 60 years they eat the roots as well they
[01:16:36.080 --> 01:16:39.400]  pull them up so nothing grows back they're very destructive cows don't do
[01:16:39.400 --> 01:16:44.400]  that deer don't do that and it turns central Texas if you drive out like to
[01:16:44.400 --> 01:16:49.200]  service the moon just rocks everywhere boulders scrub brush and then a few oak
[01:16:49.200 --> 01:16:52.480]  trees but most of them have died because the soil is all gone and it's
[01:16:52.480 --> 01:16:57.880]  admittedly the goats well if you think a goat's destructive folks the chemicals
[01:16:57.880 --> 01:17:02.320]  they use like roundup all over the country is admittedly annihilating and
[01:17:02.320 --> 01:17:06.360]  killing the soil right and people I've talked to a lot of farmers all over and
[01:17:06.360 --> 01:17:09.920]  and it's it's getting harder and harder you talked about the insects being
[01:17:09.920 --> 01:17:17.880]  destroyed the herbs are being destroyed I mean there's I think 200 species going
[01:17:17.880 --> 01:17:23.640]  extinct every few months of medicinal herbs so people are having to grow in
[01:17:23.640 --> 01:17:28.160]  greenhouses now because the acidity of the soil from the air well I've had a
[01:17:28.160 --> 01:17:30.680]  high-level state people on from California who've been out in these
[01:17:30.680 --> 01:17:34.160]  documentaries and they go we don't know what's doing it but aluminum is 30 40
[01:17:34.160 --> 01:17:38.120]  50 times what it was a decade ago something's falling and the plants
[01:17:38.120 --> 01:17:41.640]  won't grow in it but don't worry Monsanto's coming out with a whole line
[01:17:41.640 --> 01:17:47.400]  of seeds that are resistant to aluminum and so and they can grow in acidic soil
[01:17:47.400 --> 01:17:53.080]  yeah man these people are beyond villains in Marvel comic books it's
[01:17:53.080 --> 01:17:56.600]  crazy it's the you know it's it's where's Lex Luthor when you need him he'd be
[01:17:56.600 --> 01:18:00.000]  better for president of these guys you know right now we're in that age of
[01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:04.880]  manipulating they're trying to play God they're transhumanism like we had talked
[01:18:04.880 --> 01:18:07.960]  about well here's the difference if you put one of the super villains for
[01:18:07.960 --> 01:18:10.360]  Marvel comics in charge they may not destroy everything is they just want to
[01:18:10.360 --> 01:18:13.520]  be in charge like a you know Luther would just want to be in charge these
[01:18:13.520 --> 01:18:17.520]  globalists as you said they're in charge and they want to screw us over yep
[01:18:17.520 --> 01:18:21.040]  that's what's going on as a matter of fact I mean all he wanted from Zod was
[01:18:21.040 --> 01:18:26.680]  Australia I'm sorry go ahead well I was just gonna say I mean you know
[01:18:26.680 --> 01:18:30.600]  everything is going down and I actually had an article where one in four young
[01:18:30.600 --> 01:18:35.400]  doctors are experiencing symptoms of depression right now one in four doctors
[01:18:35.400 --> 01:18:39.360]  but I also talked to dog I'm not trying that's because subconsciously they don't
[01:18:39.360 --> 01:18:43.880]  feel good about what they're doing yeah you think that's what it is well I mean
[01:18:43.880 --> 01:18:47.000]  any profession where you don't feel good about what you're doing is the most
[01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:50.640]  depressing thing take soldiers if they felt like it's a good war then it
[01:18:50.640 --> 01:18:53.200]  doesn't hurt them that bad if they feel like it's a bad war they come on and
[01:18:53.200 --> 01:18:55.680]  blow their heads off I don't know maybe it's because of all the fluoride and all
[01:18:55.680 --> 01:18:59.480]  the the medications that they're taking to that's calcifying their pineal gland
[01:18:59.480 --> 01:19:05.040]  I agree I think it's a cocktail because medical doctors actually even in medical
[01:19:05.040 --> 01:19:09.560]  school are highly addicted to Adderall and different types of caffeine and
[01:19:09.560 --> 01:19:13.320]  stimulants because they have to stay up long hours and and that's been oh every
[01:19:13.320 --> 01:19:16.800]  soldier I talked to now this is always gone you know they ordered Elvis on speed
[01:19:16.800 --> 01:19:21.120]  so you could play for the army but everybody I mean they would order big
[01:19:21.120 --> 01:19:25.960]  and then to take opiates and speed and helicopters would land Russian helicopters
[01:19:25.960 --> 01:19:29.160]  was who the army used for delivery of the drugs and they would be told give
[01:19:29.160 --> 01:19:33.840]  these to your men and they did it to compromise them so later they could then
[01:19:33.840 --> 01:19:37.560]  tell them okay sign these forms will give you more drugs right yeah it's
[01:19:37.560 --> 01:19:41.720]  really sad what's happening to the VA's out there to the VA hospitals and all
[01:19:41.720 --> 01:19:45.440]  the veterans out there that are addicted this was in Afghanistan they were
[01:19:45.440 --> 01:19:48.740]  ordering them on I know I talked to them they call my office wanting to detox
[01:19:48.740 --> 01:19:51.680]  of course they won't let they would order big tell your men take this here's
[01:19:51.680 --> 01:19:56.360]  giant bags of you know every opiate you can imagine he'd be like what getting
[01:19:56.360 --> 01:19:59.920]  them ready to get on heroin we'll be back still wondering what to get that

[01:24:50.280 --> 01:24:54.480]  song like this I know especially the holiday season when everybody's gets
[01:24:54.480 --> 01:24:57.760]  together with their family and you know all about this stuff and you have the
[01:24:57.760 --> 01:25:01.480]  whole other family out there and you're sitting there around Thanksgiving or
[01:25:01.480 --> 01:25:05.720]  Christmas and you have the whole family talking about what's going on on CNN and
[01:25:05.720 --> 01:25:09.880]  you're just sitting there biting your lip thinking I'm not even getting exactly
[01:25:09.880 --> 01:25:13.360]  you this happens I'll try most my families wait but sometimes people come
[01:25:13.360 --> 01:25:17.560]  over and I won't be saying a word and then they'll bring up the smart mouth
[01:25:17.560 --> 01:25:22.440]  comment like I bet that black hill look up is gonna get me or I bet the space
[01:25:22.440 --> 01:25:26.280]  aliens you know I bet the Chewbacca but as I had none of the table Alex you know
[01:25:26.280 --> 01:25:30.240]  Rachel Maddow says that you say Obama sent a tornado and that you believe in
[01:25:30.240 --> 01:25:34.480]  spacemen under the Pentagon and it's like no I never said that by the way they
[01:25:34.480 --> 01:25:37.760]  had a bunch of Trump's campaign run up to him I later learned after it was like
[01:25:37.760 --> 01:25:42.760]  look he believes there was no moon landing look Alex Jones you know says
[01:25:42.760 --> 01:25:46.760]  there's wasp from the Pentagon's they had headlines saying that again last week
[01:25:46.760 --> 01:25:51.280]  and Trump went yeah they say that about me too I bet that's not true so it just
[01:25:51.280 --> 01:25:55.240]  didn't work that's a problem he just he knows they're a pack of liars he doesn't
[01:25:55.240 --> 01:25:59.200]  care so they're all over every channel right now grip saying get rid of him
[01:25:59.200 --> 01:26:04.320]  Obama says he's not qualified he's just qualified now so Obama is now our Lord

[01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:39.840]  fourth hour the Anthony you see already hit all this other medical and health
[01:27:39.840 --> 01:27:44.680]  news you haven't gotten to yet but the time we have left here what do you think
[01:27:44.680 --> 01:27:50.280]  the best if people can only get like three products from force life comm to
[01:27:50.280 --> 01:27:54.080]  give as gifts to their friends and family to hopefully get them on the road to
[01:27:54.080 --> 01:27:57.960]  nutraceuticals to just discover what their body was deficient in or what
[01:27:57.960 --> 01:28:02.720]  these compounds can do for them I would guess x2 super male or super female
[01:28:02.720 --> 01:28:08.480]  vitality and something like the deep cleanse or out of the 1617 in force
[01:28:08.480 --> 01:28:11.680]  life products what are three you'd recommend to put under the tree as a
[01:28:11.680 --> 01:28:17.360]  gift well no doubt everybody needs the x2 iodine I mean you're gonna see
[01:28:17.360 --> 01:28:23.960]  changes it doesn't matter if you're six years old or 86 years old every single
[01:28:23.960 --> 01:28:28.400]  person is going to need iodine there's no doubt about it I would say that that
[01:28:28.400 --> 01:28:33.240]  should be a staple in everybody's natural medicine cabinet and something
[01:28:33.240 --> 01:28:36.480]  people should take every day or every other day the second thing is going to
[01:28:36.480 --> 01:28:41.200]  be oxy powder because especially during the holidays the average person gains
[01:28:41.200 --> 01:28:46.360]  five pounds from October to January listen I mean even if you take yes
[01:28:46.360 --> 01:28:49.840]  you're going to be overeating you're gonna be taking in a lot of toxic
[01:28:49.840 --> 01:28:54.280]  material you're gonna be drinking while Turkey you're gonna be you know drinking
[01:28:54.280 --> 01:28:59.080]  eggnog and all the other things so listen here's the easiest simplest tip
[01:28:59.080 --> 01:29:02.440]  that I can tell somebody to do is just take a few oxy powder every single night
[01:29:02.440 --> 01:29:07.040]  through the holidays because how you gain all the weight is when it stays inside
[01:29:07.040 --> 01:29:13.120]  your system for three days and then that rotting food creates lactic acid creates
[01:29:13.120 --> 01:29:17.040]  all kinds of we've got the cleanse pack discounted right now massively we have
[01:29:17.040 --> 01:29:21.080]  the essential pack I know about this new special they launched the experts back

[01:29:49.520 --> 01:29:56.560]  empires on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[01:29:58.120 --> 01:30:01.720]  remember when we were told they hate us for our freedoms maybe it's the
[01:30:01.720 --> 01:30:05.880]  politicians who hate us for our freedoms when Donald Trump said suspend all
[01:30:05.880 --> 01:30:10.960]  Muslim immigration until we can identify the internet exploded Obama's attorney
[01:30:10.960 --> 01:30:15.080]  general Loretta Lynch told Muslims her greatest fear was not Muslim violence
[01:30:15.080 --> 01:30:19.680]  but anti-Muslim rhetoric that violent talk is not American and will be
[01:30:19.680 --> 01:30:24.200]  prosecuted is it religious freedom or Islam they want to protect they ignored
[01:30:24.200 --> 01:30:28.000]  it when Trump attacked the First Amendment in the same speech maybe in
[01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:32.560]  certain areas closing that internet up in some way somebody will say all freedom
[01:30:32.560 --> 01:30:36.800]  of speech freedom of speech these are foolish people what is foolish is to
[01:30:36.800 --> 01:30:41.200]  surrender our liberty to politicians of any strike so we have politicians and
[01:30:41.200 --> 01:30:45.400]  the press beating the drum daily telling you to surrender your firearms

[01:33:08.640 --> 01:33:14.880]  broadcasting worldwide it's Alex Jones
[01:33:18.480 --> 01:33:22.880]  first we were all gonna be freezing to death and then we were all gonna be
[01:33:22.880 --> 01:33:27.440]  burning down and then now it's just climate change period when the northern
[01:33:27.440 --> 01:33:36.280]  jail comes in and December of January we're told it's the end of the world in
[01:33:36.280 --> 01:33:39.400]  August when it hits 110 in Texas we're told that never happened before even
[01:33:39.400 --> 01:33:44.800]  though it's not true but every time we're Moncton comes on he does a great
[01:33:44.800 --> 01:33:48.640]  job but he ends up telling us the facts the science the latest meteorology
[01:33:48.640 --> 01:33:52.920]  astrophysics what this scientist says what that one says our audience knows
[01:33:52.920 --> 01:33:56.560]  that what what we want to know about is what he really does and that's get the
[01:33:56.560 --> 01:34:01.520]  secret documents get the secret treaties expose what's happening work with the
[01:34:01.520 --> 01:34:07.840]  folks that leak the hacked info to expose the criminal mastermind program
[01:34:07.840 --> 01:34:12.360]  that's taking place that's why you hear the folks running the UN summit right
[01:34:12.360 --> 01:34:18.280]  now calling for a body to arrest those of us that don't agree with whatever they
[01:34:18.280 --> 01:34:22.760]  say because it's changing all the time and it's so unprecedented to see
[01:34:22.760 --> 01:34:27.560]  something like this now we're hearing that Donald Trump is disqualified we've
[01:34:27.560 --> 01:34:32.520]  heard this from Lindsey Graham can we cue him up actually a Lindsey Graham the
[01:34:32.520 --> 01:34:38.000]  beauty queen there from the from the Carolinas we've got Lindsey Graham who
[01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:43.360]  is about as left as Obama is and we've got all these other warmongering you know
[01:34:43.360 --> 01:34:48.360]  type neocons and people globalist saying how evil Donald Trump is knowing
[01:34:48.360 --> 01:34:51.720]  it's out of context he said until we've got a handle on who's coming in what's
[01:34:51.720 --> 01:34:55.160]  going on why the State Department standing down you have a big speech on
[01:34:55.160 --> 01:35:01.080]  it we need to stop everybody coming in well it turns out Jimmy Carter did that
[01:35:01.080 --> 01:35:08.640]  there's two articles up on info wars.com he deported Iranians who were not
[01:35:08.640 --> 01:35:13.560]  openly a loyal United States by the thousands and he banned any of them
[01:35:13.560 --> 01:35:16.800]  coming in unless they had a medical emergency or were against the Shiite
[01:35:16.800 --> 01:35:23.240]  regime well now we have a Wahhabist Sunni invasion and we have a tax on the
[01:35:23.240 --> 01:35:28.640]  world taking place and he says look there's a scandal they have got to stop
[01:35:28.640 --> 01:35:33.680]  doing this they have got to stop just letting people in and not even checking
[01:35:33.680 --> 01:35:41.880]  their IDs and the answer to that was oh my gosh this is pure fascism Donald
[01:35:41.880 --> 01:35:45.840]  Trump should be banned from flying to the UK there's a petition out with close
[01:35:45.840 --> 01:35:50.600]  to a hundred thousand signatures right now that stories up on info wars.com so
[01:35:50.600 --> 01:35:54.960]  this is the madness when you see Europe's borders being collapsed by the head of
[01:35:54.960 --> 01:35:58.880]  their migrant program who's a top globalist Peter Sutherland who Monkton's
[01:35:58.880 --> 01:36:02.360]  an expert on when you see most the laws of European countries being made by the
[01:36:02.360 --> 01:36:06.480]  EU when you see the carjackings the muggings the tunnel being taken over by
[01:36:06.480 --> 01:36:11.200]  the illegals what is the master plan here because it ties in to the global
[01:36:11.200 --> 01:36:15.120]  carbon taxes it ties into what's happening with the treaty currently and
[01:36:15.120 --> 01:36:19.000]  that's what we want to know from Ward Monkton is why are they imploding our
[01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:24.040]  borders what's the master plan and what is currently happening in the secretive
[01:36:24.040 --> 01:36:28.320]  UN event because we know they have PR functions saying polar bears can't swim
[01:36:28.320 --> 01:36:33.840]  and arrest Lord Monkton and arrest Mark Moreno and rioters attacking you're
[01:36:33.840 --> 01:36:37.960]  showing of the film but when they're not trying to declare civil emergency off
[01:36:37.960 --> 01:36:41.440]  the jihadis they brought in they're trying to forge this new global
[01:36:41.440 --> 01:36:46.360]  government that you're exposing Lord Monkton joins us reporting for science
[01:36:46.360 --> 01:36:51.160]  and public policy from Paris welcome sir well it's wonderful to be with you
[01:36:51.160 --> 01:36:58.200]  again Alex here we are in Paris Paris and it's been a long hard slog inside the
[01:36:58.200 --> 01:37:02.400]  conference where they still haven't really reached any agreement they've
[01:37:02.400 --> 01:37:07.920]  managed to get the draft treaty done from 58 pages to 54 pages and then down to
[01:37:07.920 --> 01:37:12.520]  48 pages but it's still full of square brackets and the word options still
[01:37:12.520 --> 01:37:16.760]  occurs 40 or 50 times they have no agreement on whether they want to stop
[01:37:16.760 --> 01:37:22.080]  the world from warming by one and a half degrees compared with 1750 which
[01:37:22.080 --> 01:37:25.920]  would be half a degree compared with today or one degree with compared with
[01:37:25.920 --> 01:37:30.560]  today and why it is that anyone should think that half a degree or one degree
[01:37:30.560 --> 01:37:35.080]  of warming compared with today would be a bad thing I find it very hard to make
[01:37:35.080 --> 01:37:40.080]  out in the past warmer period such as the medieval warm period the Roman warm
[01:37:40.080 --> 01:37:44.040]  period the Minoan warm period the Egyptian old kingdom warm period and
[01:37:44.040 --> 01:37:50.400]  the 4,000 years of the Holocene climate optimum which lasted from 10,000 to 6,000
[01:37:50.400 --> 01:37:54.000]  years ago all of these were called climate optima because optimum is better
[01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:58.920]  warm is better than cold even for polar bears wait a minute are you saying Pluto
[01:37:58.920 --> 01:38:03.640]  wouldn't be better for us to live on the earth Pluto really wouldn't be better
[01:38:03.640 --> 01:38:07.560]  for us to live on but I tell you what it would be very good to export everyone
[01:38:07.560 --> 01:38:11.720]  who is at this conference to Pluto and leave them there for a few years to
[01:38:11.720 --> 01:38:16.920]  experience what cold really is like I think they'd come back come back as
[01:38:16.920 --> 01:38:24.240]  corpsicles they come back wiser anyway yeah I guess being dead is better than
[01:38:24.240 --> 01:38:27.680]  being dumb no I mean I'm being sarcastic there we wish no harm upon these
[01:38:27.680 --> 01:38:33.400]  people they wish harm upon us describe for us exactly what happened at the
[01:38:33.400 --> 01:38:38.760]  showing of this film that you and Mark Moreno are and I saw just fits of people
[01:38:38.760 --> 01:38:44.240]  demanding you and he be arrested wanted signs frothing demands that the film not
[01:38:44.240 --> 01:38:49.640]  be shown by the liberals well they call themselves liberal but of course they're
[01:38:49.640 --> 01:38:53.200]  really illiberal and we shouldn't use the word liberal for the so-called
[01:38:53.200 --> 01:38:57.080]  liberals or democrat for the so-called so-called democrats these are
[01:38:57.080 --> 01:39:01.920]  totalitarians these are the people of the same stamp as the fascists and the
[01:39:01.920 --> 01:39:06.560]  communists who shrieked across Europe in the last century here they are back out
[01:39:06.560 --> 01:39:12.240]  of the woodwork again and very evident at the climate hustle launch now climate
[01:39:12.240 --> 01:39:17.520]  hustle is a wonderful movie I was one of the bit part walk-on players in the
[01:39:17.520 --> 01:39:21.480]  movie and you'll see there in that photograph a James Delling pole of
[01:39:21.480 --> 01:39:26.080]  Breitbart comm standing next to Mark Moreno and of course we had our very
[01:39:26.080 --> 01:39:30.720]  own polar bear who very much enjoyed the film polar bears have become something
[01:39:30.720 --> 01:39:34.680]  something opposed to child of both sides the other side of course pretending that
[01:39:34.680 --> 01:39:38.520]  polar bears are threatened by global warming and our side demonstrating that
[01:39:38.520 --> 01:39:42.560]  there are now six or seven times as many polar bears as there were in the 1960s
[01:39:42.560 --> 01:39:45.960]  and so there really isn't any need to worry about sure but let's go back to
[01:39:45.960 --> 01:39:50.440]  the sun as you know five years ago they voted to say the sun is not the main
[01:39:50.440 --> 01:39:53.880]  driver even a driver of climate because they want to control the earth they
[01:39:53.880 --> 01:39:57.960]  claim that they control the thermostat is this not the ultimate control
[01:39:57.960 --> 01:40:03.600]  freakism well it reminds me very much of an old king of England who came to us
[01:40:03.600 --> 01:40:08.680]  from Denmark he was King Knut or Knut as they call him in Denmark and he once had
[01:40:08.680 --> 01:40:14.120]  his throne taken to the shore and he he put his he sat on the throne had all
[01:40:14.120 --> 01:40:18.080]  his courtiers around him he stretched out his hand and told the incoming tide
[01:40:18.080 --> 01:40:23.560]  to not to come in and the sea level to stop rising and the sea level didn't
[01:40:23.560 --> 01:40:26.920]  stop rising the tide came in and wet the royal feet and he turned to his
[01:40:26.920 --> 01:40:30.760]  courtiers and my mother I wish this conference would listen to this and he
[01:40:30.760 --> 01:40:35.560]  said remember this that even if the denyingly divinely anointed and appointed
[01:40:35.560 --> 01:40:39.680]  king cannot command these little waves not to come up and wet the royal feet
[01:40:39.680 --> 01:40:44.080]  then remember that you too the servants of the king are limited in your powers
[01:40:44.080 --> 01:40:49.000]  you cannot influence the weather any more than I can therefore be humble and
[01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:53.720]  remember it is the Lord who made the oceans and the land he alone commands
[01:40:53.720 --> 01:40:59.120]  the sea and the waves and to him and not to me be all praise now there was a
[01:40:59.120 --> 01:41:03.640]  humble king who wanted to show that if he was humble and sensible so should his
[01:41:03.640 --> 01:41:08.760]  courtiers be and the worldwide governing class now could do a lot to learn from
[01:41:08.760 --> 01:41:13.360]  him and from you Alex as your studio floats rather dangerously close to the
[01:41:13.360 --> 01:41:18.120]  Sun from the picture I'm seeing here but the Sun of course but the UN said it
[01:41:18.120 --> 01:41:21.800]  doesn't heat the earth so I should be fine that was a real Sun behind me I
[01:41:21.800 --> 01:41:26.280]  wouldn't burn up I mean I did everything I mean Al Gore controls the earth not the
[01:41:26.280 --> 01:41:31.160]  sun it is crazy we know from the the longest regional temperature record in
[01:41:31.160 --> 01:41:37.520]  the world which goes back to 1649 which is the central England temperature
[01:41:37.520 --> 01:41:43.760]  record that between 1645 and 1715 there was a little ice age there were
[01:41:43.760 --> 01:41:48.920]  virtually no sunspots on the surface of the sun and the Thames at your end of
[01:41:48.920 --> 01:41:53.200]  the Atlantic and rather up Maron Atlantic and the Hudson at your end used
[01:41:53.200 --> 01:41:57.280]  to freeze every winter that was because the Sun wasn't very active and the
[01:41:57.280 --> 01:42:02.080]  planet cooled down the Sun in the last century was more active than almost any
[01:42:02.080 --> 01:42:06.840]  time in the last 11,700 years since the end of last ice age and naturally some
[01:42:06.840 --> 01:42:10.960]  warming has resulted from that and they're trying to blame all of this and
[01:42:10.960 --> 01:42:15.800]  more on global warming when actually it's mainly the Sun and not but it's a
[01:42:15.800 --> 01:42:18.960]  12,000 year cycle aren't we coming to the end of it the next couple hundred
[01:42:18.960 --> 01:42:24.320]  years well these cycles come and go there there are 41,000 year cycles there
[01:42:24.320 --> 01:42:28.880]  are 110,000 year cycles these are known as the Milankovitch cycles of the orbital
[01:42:28.880 --> 01:42:33.320]  eccentricity the orbital obliquity of the earth and also the precession of
[01:42:33.320 --> 01:42:36.560]  the equinoxes the liberation of the earth's axis those are the three
[01:42:36.560 --> 01:42:40.360]  Milankovitch cycles they will have different cycle lengths and we don't
[01:42:40.360 --> 01:42:43.360]  really know exactly what influence they have what we do know is that over the
[01:42:43.360 --> 01:42:46.720]  very short term you won't notice much difference from them their long-term
[01:42:46.720 --> 01:42:51.400]  events short-term warming and cooling that we've seen is largely caused by
[01:42:51.400 --> 01:42:55.480]  solar variability this is very well known very well established in the
[01:42:55.480 --> 01:42:59.280]  literature of in the learning journals of solar physics there have been many
[01:42:59.280 --> 01:43:02.800]  people know exactly and I can't believe we have to sit here explaining to new
[01:43:02.800 --> 01:43:07.640]  listeners that may be liberals or or totalitarian cult members that that the
[01:43:07.640 --> 01:43:12.240]  Sun you know if we're closer to it if we're turned towards it that that's why
[01:43:12.240 --> 01:43:16.200]  we have the seasons and that's why on you know one side of the planet it'll be
[01:43:16.200 --> 01:43:19.520]  warmer on the other side it's colder I can't believe that they call us
[01:43:19.520 --> 01:43:23.640]  conspiracy theorists for those that don't know there are major articles in the
[01:43:23.640 --> 01:43:27.360]  Guardian and others making jokes about this claiming it's not the Sun which of
[01:43:27.360 --> 01:43:31.360]  course we didn't have the Sun we'd be absolute zero in a matter of days and
[01:43:31.360 --> 01:43:35.000]  all be dead in a doornail I mean I just can't believe that they argue with this
[01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:38.360]  I mean they've almost got to the point where they're telling us that the
[01:43:38.360 --> 01:43:42.160]  seasons are called by it caused by man-made global warming it's getting
[01:43:42.160 --> 01:43:45.600]  child more and more childish as time goes on but there hasn't now been any
[01:43:45.600 --> 01:43:50.400]  global warming for 18 years and nine months and you can bet that not one in
[01:43:50.400 --> 01:43:55.440]  a thousand of the 40,000 delegates crammed into the sheds surrounding the
[01:43:55.440 --> 01:44:00.800]  private jet airport where Al Gore and other wasters flew in you can bet that
[01:44:00.800 --> 01:44:05.240]  not one of them even knows there hasn't been any global warming because the one
[01:44:05.240 --> 01:44:09.360]  thing that's been very evident Alex at these conferences over recent years is
[01:44:09.360 --> 01:44:14.200]  the one thing they do not discuss is either the science or the economics of
[01:44:14.200 --> 01:44:17.560]  global warming they are no longer concerned with that they're concerned
[01:44:17.560 --> 01:44:22.400]  only with introducing a totalitarian world government as soon as they let's
[01:44:22.400 --> 01:44:25.400]  talk about that they were very close five years ago Copenhagen you got the
[01:44:25.400 --> 01:44:30.480]  secret tax that was a giant tax increase on poor people their class baiting blew
[01:44:30.480 --> 01:44:34.360]  up in their face they're still back trying to ram it through how's it going
[01:44:34.360 --> 01:44:38.680]  for them and I know it's so secretive now because it's so open and liberal that
[01:44:38.680 --> 01:44:43.600]  you that it's hard to fair it out info but what have you got your hands on the
[01:44:43.600 --> 01:44:50.440]  main thing is that they are still willing for the moment to allow the any
[01:44:50.440 --> 01:44:54.440]  country that wishes to leave the process to give just one year's notice long as
[01:44:54.440 --> 01:44:57.520]  they wait three years from the signing of this agreement and then they can break
[01:44:57.520 --> 01:45:02.280]  free of it and as long as that stays in at least we have some hope but otherwise
[01:45:02.280 --> 01:45:07.160]  increasingly the conference is moving towards saying we can only have half a
[01:45:07.160 --> 01:45:11.600]  Celsius degree more global warming than the temperature is today before the
[01:45:11.600 --> 01:45:15.200]  planet will fry now this of course is complete nonsense but that is the new
[01:45:15.200 --> 01:45:18.040]  limit they're setting themselves and I'll tell you why they're setting it
[01:45:18.040 --> 01:45:23.280]  because privately some of them have begun to work out that the exaggerated
[01:45:23.280 --> 01:45:28.440]  forecasts of the UN's climate panel have proven to be wild exaggerations on all
[01:45:28.440 --> 01:45:33.120]  the measures of temperature that we've had since 1990 when they first made the
[01:45:33.120 --> 01:45:37.000]  exaggerated predictions on which the scare is founded they've begun to
[01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:40.920]  realize this and so now they're saying even the tiniest tiniest little I mean
[01:45:40.920 --> 01:45:45.560]  half a Celsius degree is less than the difference between walking from one
[01:45:45.560 --> 01:45:48.560]  room to another in your house and they're suddenly saying that if that
[01:45:48.560 --> 01:45:51.880]  happened to the globe as a whole this would be catastrophe well of course it
[01:45:51.880 --> 01:45:57.080]  is sheer rudimentary it's complete nonsense it's just made up but they're
[01:45:57.080 --> 01:46:02.400]  now programmed to go ahead and try and enact this nonsense but it doesn't
[01:46:02.400 --> 01:46:07.240]  really matter because they haven't really succeeded in making any binding
[01:46:07.240 --> 01:46:10.960]  commitments on anybody so they may try to extend it a few days like they always do
[01:46:10.960 --> 01:46:15.880]  they will try that but President Hollande who is the president of France
[01:46:15.880 --> 01:46:20.560]  and he of course is hurting quite badly at the moment because the anti-immigration
[01:46:20.560 --> 01:46:26.520]  Marine Le Pen and her four national has taken an enormous victory with 28% of the
[01:46:26.520 --> 01:46:31.960]  vote beating but the Socialist Party and the slightly less socialist Republican
[01:46:31.960 --> 01:46:38.240]  Party into into second and third place respectively and if Le Pen remains the
[01:46:38.240 --> 01:46:42.840]  largest party by 2017 when the next presidential elections come on we could
[01:46:42.840 --> 01:46:49.320]  have a national front anti-immigration leader in charge of France and similar
[01:46:49.320 --> 01:46:53.720]  things could happen in Britain if UKIP continues its advance there because we
[01:46:53.720 --> 01:46:58.680]  too are in favor of sensibly regulating immigration rather than collapsing our
[01:46:58.680 --> 01:47:03.040]  borders that you spoke to let me expand on that as you know John Coleman
[01:47:03.040 --> 01:47:07.560]  prestigious meteorologist founder of the weather channel was on with us last
[01:47:07.560 --> 01:47:11.160]  week and he he said hi to you he was watching the day before when you were
[01:47:11.160 --> 01:47:17.200]  on and when Donald Trump was on and he brought up the point that you had said
[01:47:17.200 --> 01:47:20.240]  that you thought we'd turn the corner and we're winning I agree every indicator
[01:47:20.240 --> 01:47:23.960]  shows that at least intellectually scientifically factually but he said
[01:47:23.960 --> 01:47:27.320]  they're so retaliatory and they'll just move forward but he says he just thinks
[01:47:27.320 --> 01:47:32.000]  it'll be a long fight where you never even see who wins it's just that
[01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:36.600]  technology and science and free market even though stunted by the socialist and
[01:47:36.600 --> 01:47:42.240]  the collectivist will grow so fast and be so alluring that we will just innovate
[01:47:42.240 --> 01:47:46.320]  out of this but that's why the command and controllers are trying to stunt
[01:47:46.320 --> 01:47:49.960]  innovation is because they're threatened by it and I know you're an expert on
[01:47:49.960 --> 01:47:53.040]  these people you worked in the Margaret Thatcher government and you know had to
[01:47:53.040 --> 01:47:57.680]  deal with them can you elaborate on where you see the fight against these
[01:47:57.680 --> 01:48:01.920]  kleptocrats being right now I think what's going to happen Alex is that more
[01:48:01.920 --> 01:48:06.640]  and more organizations like your own are going to spring into being not just in
[01:48:06.640 --> 01:48:10.280]  the media sector but in other sectors I'm working quite hard for into the moment
[01:48:10.280 --> 01:48:14.480]  with people in several countries and the French libertarians that I was at a
[01:48:14.480 --> 01:48:17.920]  party with last night were fascinated by this we're looking at
[01:48:17.920 --> 01:48:24.960]  establishing our own independent global fully asset funded currency one that
[01:48:24.960 --> 01:48:29.440]  really can't inflate and that is something which will simply take the
[01:48:29.440 --> 01:48:32.680]  world by surprise because it isn't actually illegal to do this as long as
[01:48:32.680 --> 01:48:37.240]  you don't call it a currency as long as you don't issue notes and coin you can
[01:48:37.240 --> 01:48:40.720]  still let people draw on it on their credit cards and have savings accounts
[01:48:40.720 --> 01:48:44.240]  in it but at least they'll know that unlike the Federal Reserve which has
[01:48:44.240 --> 01:48:50.240]  taken 99 cents out of every dollar since it was founded in 1913 by catastrophic
[01:48:50.240 --> 01:48:55.400]  bad management over the last 102 years if you'd had one of ours you'd have $5,000
[01:48:55.400 --> 01:48:59.000]  instead of $1 now because of the appreciation in value and so what
[01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:04.000]  we're going to do is to start setting up parallel institutions that were
[01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:07.080]  previously the province of government we're not going to try to call ourselves
[01:49:07.080 --> 01:49:10.280]  governments we're not going to do what the UN is trying to do here at La Borgia
[01:49:10.280 --> 01:49:16.240]  what we are going to do is simply to set up our own parallel activities that
[01:49:16.240 --> 01:49:19.920]  government previously regarded generously as its own preserve and
[01:49:19.920 --> 01:49:24.760]  gradually governments will in Marx's phrase wither away because they will
[01:49:24.760 --> 01:49:29.800]  become less and less relevant as they well that's what Coleman saying I mean
[01:49:29.800 --> 01:49:32.200]  as you're saying and he's a guy that started a company that you know sold
[01:49:32.200 --> 01:49:36.360]  for billions and he knows what he's doing is we just have to innovate our way
[01:49:36.360 --> 01:49:39.880]  out we have to have art we have to have our own culture we have to have our own
[01:49:39.880 --> 01:49:45.880]  free will and aggressively stand up for ourselves but also laugh and ridicule at
[01:49:45.880 --> 01:49:49.560]  the so-called intellectuals who are really just a stunted cult of
[01:49:49.560 --> 01:49:53.960]  miscreant control freaks well that's exactly right and John Coleman I'm a
[01:49:53.960 --> 01:49:58.560]  huge admirer of his he has had the courage and it takes courage in the
[01:49:58.560 --> 01:50:02.920]  media these days to stand up to the nonsense and he's been very successful
[01:50:02.920 --> 01:50:06.960]  in being a voice of calm on the West Coast and there aren't very many voices
[01:50:06.960 --> 01:50:11.760]  have come on the West Coast in the land of Arnold Schwarzenegger who has just
[01:50:11.760 --> 01:50:16.080]  come out and said that people ought to go into their their sheds and shut the
[01:50:16.080 --> 01:50:19.480]  door and turn on the engine of their car and not be allowed to turn it off for an
[01:50:19.480 --> 01:50:23.440]  hour and see what they like see how they feel like at the end of that hour that
[01:50:23.440 --> 01:50:27.720]  would kill you this is it would indeed kill you dead and this is the kind of
[01:50:27.720 --> 01:50:34.080]  craziness that we're now getting from a parentless sober senior figures in the

[01:53:55.200 --> 01:53:58.000]  Pennsylvania
[01:53:58.000 --> 01:54:23.240]  by the way one of my lead stories today was gonna be this particular article
[01:54:23.240 --> 01:54:28.440]  from CNN and I haven't gotten to it yet I'll ask Lord Moncton about it Trump is
[01:54:28.440 --> 01:54:32.320]  threatening to leave the Republican Party if the entire leadership of it
[01:54:32.320 --> 01:54:36.640]  doesn't keep calling for him to step down and leave when he would get 60 plus
[01:54:36.640 --> 01:54:42.160]  percent what is it 67% in major polls of the Republican vote as a third party
[01:54:42.160 --> 01:54:47.640]  candidate Trump says his backers would support an independent bid and he's
[01:54:47.640 --> 01:54:51.040]  saying look I've I'm gonna run as a Republican but stop trying to kick me out
[01:54:51.040 --> 01:54:55.840]  I did what Jimmy Carter you know did all I'm saying is until they check visas
[01:54:55.840 --> 01:54:59.480]  until they vet people you got to block people coming in of these Muslim
[01:54:59.480 --> 01:55:05.160]  countries but he's miscalculating in a way the Republican leadership wants to
[01:55:05.160 --> 01:55:10.120]  fail they're bought and paid for they're run by the Democrats that's how big a
[01:55:10.120 --> 01:55:15.120]  political horrors they are most of them but there's certainly a fight on big
[01:55:15.120 --> 01:55:21.080]  time meanwhile I did find the article Schwarzenegger did just come out and say
[01:55:21.080 --> 01:55:24.120]  basically if you don't support you know renewable energies that means give them
[01:55:24.120 --> 01:55:27.360]  the power let their industries get taxpayer money he's made it so much
[01:55:27.360 --> 01:55:32.160]  money and be inside the older than Ron you name it literally I mean just look
[01:55:32.160 --> 01:55:37.440]  at Schwarzenegger what a joke I mean give me a break perfect though in Conan
[01:55:37.440 --> 01:55:40.600]  a barbarian that's a clap movie to say he deserved Academy Award for that because
[01:55:40.600 --> 01:55:44.560]  he's actually playing himself and he is a barbarian looting us though he's not a
[01:55:44.560 --> 01:55:50.840]  noble savage and then you got Angela Merkel who's now been declared person
[01:55:50.840 --> 01:55:54.320]  of the year by Time Magazine why don't you give her a peace prize it's like
[01:55:54.320 --> 01:55:58.280]  toilet paper now to get that award because she opened the borders and
[01:55:58.280 --> 01:56:01.720]  flooded them with globalism and is arresting Germans to criticize open
[01:56:01.720 --> 01:56:04.720]  borders what do you think Merkel and Schwarzenegger really deserve Lord
[01:56:04.720 --> 01:56:09.560]  Monkton see what they deserve they deserve what's just about to happen to
[01:56:09.560 --> 01:56:15.640]  Greenpeace because as you know Patrick Moore the founder of Greenpeace has now
[01:56:15.640 --> 01:56:20.320]  separated himself from that organization and he announced in a shock move here
[01:56:20.320 --> 01:56:26.320]  yesterday that he had submitted a complaint to the FBI against Greenpeace
[01:56:26.320 --> 01:56:32.400]  under the Rico statute under the wire fraud statute under the tampering with
[01:56:32.400 --> 01:56:37.960]  witnesses statute and under the obstruction of Congress statute because
[01:56:37.960 --> 01:56:44.580]  Greenpeace had tried to do an entrapment operation on Professor Will
[01:56:44.580 --> 01:56:48.680]  Harper one of the two or three most eminent physicists in the world and
[01:56:48.680 --> 01:56:54.640]  absolutely straight and honest man try they set up a bogus corporation which
[01:56:54.640 --> 01:57:00.520]  was established in the Bearoot souk in a crumbling concrete building in offices
[01:57:00.520 --> 01:57:07.040]  you rent by the hour and from there they tried to entrap Will Harper who
[01:57:07.040 --> 01:57:11.760]  who of course being good man played it with a completely straight bat but they
[01:57:11.760 --> 01:57:15.520]  nevertheless pretended that he had been dishonest and had taken money he
[01:57:15.520 --> 01:57:20.160]  shouldn't have taken from fossil fuel companies and they tried to badger him
[01:57:20.160 --> 01:57:24.400]  in in the hearing room immediately before the hearing and he called them
[01:57:24.400 --> 01:57:28.280]  sons of bitches and told them to get out and eventually security dragged them
[01:57:28.280 --> 01:57:32.280]  away and I hope they've locked them up in a cell somewhere but Patrick Moore is
[01:57:32.280 --> 01:57:37.160]  one of many people who have written to the FBI and saying enough is enough
[01:57:37.160 --> 01:57:44.040]  Greenpeace is in Patrick Moore's phrase now an enemy of humanity and an enemy of
[01:57:44.040 --> 01:57:48.800]  the earth and an enemy of all species and all that's what Putin saying he says
[01:57:48.800 --> 01:57:52.880]  the carbon tax is an enemy of humanity to destroy nation states and bankrupt
[01:57:52.880 --> 01:57:56.840]  people I mean how big of a game changer is that to have Putin come out and say
[01:57:56.840 --> 01:58:01.400]  this is all pure baloney well Putin of course originally did have that view
[01:58:01.400 --> 01:58:08.040]  because his economic advisor ten years ago dr. Andrew Illarionov advised him
[01:58:08.040 --> 01:58:12.240]  that global warming was nonsense after he'd listened to a nincompoop called
[01:58:12.240 --> 01:58:17.240]  Sir David King who is now the chief UK negotiator who's here bleating away at
[01:58:17.240 --> 01:58:22.880]  these talks in the bourgeois but listening to him in 2004 in Moscow
[01:58:22.880 --> 01:58:27.920]  Illarionov came to the view and told Putin there was no problem about global
[01:58:27.920 --> 01:58:31.200]  warming and they should no longer believe in it there's no doubt putin's waking up
[01:58:31.200 --> 01:58:33.960]  do five more minutes with us back at seventy seconds Lord Monkton then

[02:00:27.120 --> 02:00:32.920]  the right wing has produced tyrants in the past the left wing has as well but
[02:00:32.920 --> 02:00:38.320]  as Lord Moncton points on going back to China thousands of years ago you have
[02:00:38.320 --> 02:00:43.520]  the libertarians and the totalitarians and that's openly there what they taught
[02:00:43.520 --> 02:00:48.480]  the totalitarians and the libertarians or the whole Confucius movement versus the
[02:00:48.480 --> 02:00:55.640]  you know pro-imperials oppressing the population and you sit here and you
[02:00:55.640 --> 02:01:00.040]  watch classic authoritarian totalitarians run around lecturing everyone
[02:01:00.040 --> 02:01:03.800]  screaming that they want to arrest you you have to understand I have to actually
[02:01:03.800 --> 02:01:10.040]  water down what I say because I can't even believe it I can't even believe they
[02:01:10.040 --> 02:01:14.640]  had multiple newspapers and TV stations say that the Christians deserve to die
[02:01:14.640 --> 02:01:18.760]  when these Muslims killed them because Christianity is hateful I mean New York
[02:01:18.760 --> 02:01:25.040]  Daily News had a major headline with that and when you come to grips with what
[02:01:25.040 --> 02:01:29.600]  hateful weird freaks these people are and they have they have scientific studies
[02:01:29.600 --> 02:01:34.080]  in Canada in the UK the environmentalists are six times more likely to rob or
[02:01:34.080 --> 02:01:40.000]  steal or to lie but they're more likely to say they're making donations and
[02:01:40.000 --> 02:01:43.600]  Lord Monkton you got four minutes left on this point but I think you're hitting
[02:01:43.600 --> 02:01:48.560]  it on the head there that these are not liberals these are not Thomas Jefferson's
[02:01:48.560 --> 02:01:54.920]  that we're talking about these people are a cult of stunted mentally ill people
[02:01:54.920 --> 02:02:00.040]  and their con artist controllers we must start taking back the language the so-called
[02:02:00.040 --> 02:02:03.640]  Democratic Party are not Democrats we must call them what they are the
[02:02:03.640 --> 02:02:07.880]  totalitarians the so-called liberals are not liberal we must call them what
[02:02:07.880 --> 02:02:12.120]  they are which is totalitarians the so-called radicals are not radical we
[02:02:12.120 --> 02:02:16.840]  must call them what they are communists totalitarians let us no longer allow them
[02:02:16.840 --> 02:02:21.320]  to steal our language to make themselves seem fragrant when in fact they stink
[02:02:21.320 --> 02:02:26.360]  it's high time that we got tough on these people and your audience here can help
[02:02:26.360 --> 02:02:31.840]  Alex you can look up the story about how Patrick Moore has has complained to the
[02:02:31.840 --> 02:02:37.120]  FBI about a nasty attempt a failed attempt that which has backfired very
[02:02:37.120 --> 02:02:42.680]  badly on Greenpeace this this hatefield organization to entrap Professor Will
[02:02:42.680 --> 02:02:47.440]  Hacker Hacker just before he was due to give testimony in the US Congress an
[02:02:47.440 --> 02:02:52.640]  excellent testimony he gave to and you too can look up the story and if you
[02:02:52.640 --> 02:02:57.200]  think that Patrick Moore was right to put in a complaint to the FBI then get
[02:02:57.200 --> 02:03:01.680]  on to the FBI website click to the link that allows you to make a complaint and
[02:03:01.680 --> 02:03:08.280]  add your voice to his just tell the FBI that it is not acceptable that people
[02:03:08.280 --> 02:03:13.120]  should go around intimidating witnesses due to appear before Congress the
[02:03:13.120 --> 02:03:17.400]  Greenpeace has behaved illegally under the Rico Statute and the wire fraud
[02:03:17.400 --> 02:03:23.200]  statute also by setting up a bogus company in in the Beirut souk and
[02:03:23.200 --> 02:03:27.760]  pretending to operate from there and pretending to entrap people like Hacker
[02:03:27.760 --> 02:03:32.280]  of course is so honest they absolutely failed but of course they still spun it
[02:03:32.280 --> 02:03:36.280]  as though they had caught him out taking money from hated fossil fuel companies
[02:03:36.280 --> 02:03:40.840]  even if he had taken money from them which he didn't and he made it quite
[02:03:40.840 --> 02:03:44.760]  plain that he didn't he still wouldn't have been doing anything wrong he's a
[02:03:44.760 --> 02:03:48.240]  very honorable man and he always makes it plain but they admit that almost all
[02:03:48.240 --> 02:03:52.720]  the big fossil fuel companies support the global warming fraud they do indeed
[02:03:52.720 --> 02:03:56.640]  Exxon Mobil is one of the largest subsidizers of the I'm still waiting for
[02:03:56.640 --> 02:04:00.360]  my check from the old companies I haven't ever gotten one I'm still waiting for
[02:04:00.360 --> 02:04:04.920]  mine hasn't come this week at all and the problem is this Alex that these
[02:04:04.920 --> 02:04:10.240]  companies are themselves now in danger of being dragged into what has become and
[02:04:10.240 --> 02:04:15.120]  the word you've just used is the correct word a global fraud and one of the
[02:04:15.120 --> 02:04:20.400]  things that we on the questioning side of the debate have decided to do here at
[02:04:20.400 --> 02:04:27.560]  LeBorge is to establish our own fraud investigation team under the aegis of
[02:04:27.560 --> 02:04:33.000]  the independent committee on Geoethics which is a committee of very eminent
[02:04:33.000 --> 02:04:36.600]  professors from around the world and one by one we're going to start
[02:04:36.600 --> 02:04:41.520]  investigating yes do it project Veritas does Lord Moncton when this
[02:04:41.520 --> 02:04:44.200]  conference is over next week we want to get a final update from you when you're

[02:05:14.400 --> 02:05:19.280]  they've kept it quiet but now they're talking about it openly your food is on
[02:05:19.280 --> 02:05:23.840]  the austerity menu we're being told now that livestock beef pork chicken etc
[02:05:23.840 --> 02:05:28.160]  create as much greenhouse gas as all the cars planes ships and other
[02:05:28.160 --> 02:05:33.000]  transportation combined but don't worry the carbon billionaires already have a
[02:05:33.000 --> 02:05:37.400]  solution for their fantasy problem Bill Gates and Google Ventures have

[02:08:29.200 --> 02:08:36.560]  Welcome back we're coming to you from deep in the heart of Texas Austin broadcasting all over the country
[02:08:36.560 --> 02:08:42.520]  on over 170 AM and FM stations global shortwave satellite but really what's
[02:08:42.520 --> 02:08:46.320]  scary to the establishment is over a million people with the podcast every
[02:08:46.320 --> 02:08:50.640]  day two or three million people on one YouTube channel a day millions a day on
[02:08:50.640 --> 02:08:55.480]  Facebook mentions millions and millions more on other platforms we're talking
[02:08:55.480 --> 02:09:00.360]  20 million people a week worldwide about 10 million up in North America about
[02:09:00.360 --> 02:09:06.880]  half our audience and it's growing exponentially so I'm not bragging about
[02:09:06.880 --> 02:09:12.120]  info wars I'm putting out the good news that the more hardcore we get the more
[02:09:12.120 --> 02:09:16.680]  we put our reporters out there on the ground the more the establishment freaks
[02:09:16.680 --> 02:09:20.520]  out and tries to misrepresent what we've said what we've done what we stand for
[02:09:20.520 --> 02:09:24.120]  and they do that to everybody else who's a libertarian or a constitutional as they
[02:09:24.120 --> 02:09:26.880]  do it to Tucker Carlson they do it to World End Daily they do it to Matt
[02:09:26.880 --> 02:09:30.720]  Drudge they do it to Donald Trump and it's not the Donald Trump's perfect but
[02:09:30.720 --> 02:09:34.880]  and it can be seen as extreme because we're a free open society that hey
[02:09:34.880 --> 02:09:39.000]  until we get a handle on things and until they're vetting people's visas then
[02:09:39.000 --> 02:09:44.520]  until Congress acts to at least look at who's coming in we will block every
[02:09:44.520 --> 02:09:49.280]  single Muslim coming into this country well they only had that we will block
[02:09:49.280 --> 02:09:52.080]  every single Muslim coming into the country turns out that's what Jimmy
[02:09:52.080 --> 02:09:56.800]  Carter did he kicked all the Iranians out basically and wouldn't let him come
[02:09:56.800 --> 02:10:01.920]  in during that whole situation that's what countries do you can't go to Saudi
[02:10:01.920 --> 02:10:05.480]  Arabia and preach the gospel of Christ you'll be imprisoned if you're lucky
[02:10:05.480 --> 02:10:12.240]  sometimes executed so it's all about misrepresentation but their hoaxes don't
[02:10:12.240 --> 02:10:15.560]  work anymore for two days they said there was any Islamic terror in San
[02:10:15.560 --> 02:10:22.000]  Bernardino, California that doesn't work anymore now joining us until
[02:10:22.000 --> 02:10:26.560]  about 50 after is Tucker Carlson it's a 20-year plus media veteran with a wide
[02:10:26.560 --> 02:10:30.800]  variety of experience in journalism currently at Fox News Carlson has also
[02:10:30.800 --> 02:10:35.920]  been CNN MSNBC PBS you name it GQ magazine but really what he's best known
[02:10:35.920 --> 02:10:41.960]  for in my view is the hard-hitting news exposing both sides of the police state
[02:10:41.960 --> 02:10:46.120]  everything from Black Lives Matter the private fellow reserve you name it
[02:10:46.120 --> 02:10:52.240]  dailycaller.com which is a mainstay when you see links at infowars.com or places
[02:10:52.240 --> 02:10:56.400]  like drudgerport.com there's so much to cover Trump where the dinosaur media is
[02:10:56.400 --> 02:11:00.240]  are they really on their last legs I mean I know you're on Fox I wouldn't
[02:11:00.240 --> 02:11:04.480]  call it dinosaur media because it's at least somewhat conservative and so it
[02:11:04.480 --> 02:11:09.160]  has a big audience but the others don't have audiences they're facades I mean I
[02:11:09.160 --> 02:11:13.000]  can turn on a Facebook mentions at home and get a million and a half viewers
[02:11:13.000 --> 02:11:17.520]  anytime I want their biggest show doesn't have a half million so when does
[02:11:17.520 --> 02:11:22.160]  the zombie finally fall down and die or can it not die because it's already dead
[02:11:22.160 --> 02:11:27.040]  Tucker Carlson I've never heard it put that way but I love it I mean you're
[02:11:27.040 --> 02:11:31.720]  you're watching it die now and you're in you're watching Donald Trump benefit
[02:11:31.720 --> 02:11:36.080]  from its death I mean the in my view the worst thing about Trump is the media
[02:11:36.080 --> 02:11:41.600]  reaction to him which is so hyperventilating and self-righteous it's
[02:11:41.600 --> 02:11:46.240]  merely an excuse for reporters to explain that they're morally superior to
[02:11:46.240 --> 02:11:50.000]  Donald Trump you know he's a bad person they're great people it's a it's a
[02:11:50.000 --> 02:11:54.880]  vehicle for their vanity and self-aggrandizement it's it's disgusting
[02:11:54.880 --> 02:11:59.120]  and you know there are things about Trump that I don't agree with and there
[02:11:59.120 --> 02:12:02.520]  are certainly things about his rhetoric that I think ought to be more precise
[02:12:02.520 --> 02:12:08.080]  that he'll explain better but none of that really compares an emotional impact
[02:12:08.080 --> 02:12:12.240]  to the feeling I get watching the press whine about him and declare him
[02:12:12.240 --> 02:12:16.880]  dangerous every time I hear that I feel like sending him money I agree with you
[02:12:16.880 --> 02:12:22.720]  what about what about senator Leslie Graham I mean excuse me Lindsey Graham
[02:12:22.720 --> 02:12:27.480]  the beauty queen he is up there just saying it's race-pating xenophobic
[02:12:27.480 --> 02:12:32.200]  religious bigot let's watch that clip from the communist news network well I
[02:12:32.200 --> 02:12:35.960]  want to talk to the Trump supporters for a minute I don't know who you are and I
[02:12:35.960 --> 02:12:40.240]  don't know why you like this guy I think what you like about him he appears to be
[02:12:40.240 --> 02:12:44.600]  strong when the rest of us are weak he's a very successful businessman and he's
[02:12:44.600 --> 02:12:48.160]  gonna make everything great he's gonna take all the problems of the world and
[02:12:48.160 --> 02:12:52.640]  put them in a box and make your life better that's what he's selling here's
[02:12:52.640 --> 02:12:58.960]  what you're buying he's a race-pating xenophobic religious bigot he doesn't
[02:12:58.960 --> 02:13:03.360]  represent my party he doesn't represent the values that the men and women who
[02:13:03.360 --> 02:13:07.040]  wear the uniform are fighting for I've been in the Air Force for 33 years I
[02:13:07.040 --> 02:13:11.760]  retired this June he's the ISIL man of the year by the way just got back from
[02:13:11.760 --> 02:13:15.520]  Morocco week that's enough Monday Hillary we played the clip last hour also
[02:13:15.520 --> 02:13:18.440]  says he's playing right in the hands of ISIS last time I checked he didn't run
[02:13:18.440 --> 02:13:21.480]  the State Department that helped build up ISIS we have the former head of
[02:13:21.480 --> 02:13:26.600]  defense intelligence himself saying that tugger let let yourself talk jump in
[02:13:26.600 --> 02:13:30.480]  here where do you see all this going well I mean Lindsey Graham is the one who
[02:13:30.480 --> 02:13:35.320]  doesn't represent obviously the views of the Republican Party look at the numbers
[02:13:35.320 --> 02:13:39.560]  I mean that you know I don't dislike Lindsey Graham as a person but he has no
[02:13:39.560 --> 02:13:44.960]  constituency and he has it strikes me no deep knowledge of the region he's the
[02:13:44.960 --> 02:13:48.480]  one who's forever telling us we need to arm this or that group about which he
[02:13:48.480 --> 02:13:52.320]  knows nothing he's not an Arabic speaker and yet he's always telling us this is
[02:13:52.320 --> 02:13:55.400]  a group of freedom fighters and your son needs to go fight on their behalf etc
[02:13:55.400 --> 02:13:59.240]  etc it's every bit in fact it's more reckless than anything Donald Trump has
[02:13:59.240 --> 02:14:03.800]  ever said here's the real reason people like Trump's recent statement on stopping
[02:14:03.800 --> 02:14:07.960]  Islamic immigration or putting a pause on it the message is really clear Donald
[02:14:07.960 --> 02:14:11.480]  Trump I I would be shocked if Donald Trump awoke in the middle of the night
[02:14:11.480 --> 02:14:15.200]  seething with hatred toward Muslims I don't know but I doubt it he does I think
[02:14:15.200 --> 02:14:18.200]  Donald Donald Trump is really worried that we're gonna see more terror attacks
[02:14:18.200 --> 02:14:21.920]  in the country and you look at Europe and its inability over 70 years to
[02:14:21.920 --> 02:14:25.640]  integrate and assimilate large Muslim populations and it does make you wonder
[02:14:25.640 --> 02:14:30.440]  like what do you you know we don't want to be Sweden or Belgium or France so
[02:14:30.440 --> 02:14:34.480]  what steps do we need to take in order to not become them that's a totally
[02:14:34.480 --> 02:14:38.040]  reasonable and rational conclusion to reason maybe you don't think that
[02:14:38.040 --> 02:14:42.440]  stopping all Muslim immigration is the answer but but at least the question is
[02:14:42.440 --> 02:14:46.880]  an essential question and only Trump seems to be asking it that's right well
[02:14:46.880 --> 02:14:51.000]  it's an extreme statement but it's extreme to have 80% being military
[02:14:51.000 --> 02:14:55.960]  H-men 80 plus percent fake passports the mainly these are Sunni invaders into
[02:14:55.960 --> 02:14:59.560]  Syria that's all admitted who who got their butt kicked they're now going into
[02:14:59.560 --> 02:15:03.840]  Turkey going into Europe and in just a month or so ago a Trump said hey we've
[02:15:03.840 --> 02:15:07.960]  got to let these poor refugees in we've got to take him his own constituents
[02:15:07.960 --> 02:15:13.280]  said hey a lot of more terrorist he got informed and then he changed his mind he
[02:15:13.280 --> 02:15:16.520]  knows there's gonna be more terror attacks after Paris and now San Bernardino
[02:15:16.520 --> 02:15:20.000]  that's right and they're taking him out of context he doesn't dislike anybody
[02:15:20.000 --> 02:15:24.840]  well exactly and again you have to compare the recklessness of Trump and
[02:15:24.840 --> 02:15:27.960]  sometimes he is reckless with the recklessness of the people who now run
[02:15:27.960 --> 02:15:31.320]  everything and Lindsey Graham is a perfect representative of that group
[02:15:31.320 --> 02:15:35.240]  right after the Paris Paris terror attacks Lindsey Graham was not only calling
[02:15:35.240 --> 02:15:38.600]  for more Syrian immigration into the United States but saying anyone who
[02:15:38.600 --> 02:15:42.320]  opposed it was so how a nativist or a bigot or a bad person or immoral or on
[02:15:42.320 --> 02:15:47.040]  the wrong side of God really I mean there's no room for debate on this I
[02:15:47.040 --> 02:15:51.280]  mean ask yourself the question does any adult really believe that Germany will
[02:15:51.280 --> 02:15:55.920]  be improved by a million refugees from Syria and surrounding countries
[02:15:55.920 --> 02:15:59.680]  Pakistan's are not just Syrians I don't think anybody really believes that and
[02:15:59.680 --> 02:16:03.400]  yet Time Magazine just gave Angela Merkel the person of the year award and
[02:16:03.400 --> 02:16:07.480]  it is effective on award to congratulate her for doing that what's the effect of
[02:16:07.480 --> 02:16:11.160]  that kind of immigration it makes the people in power feel virtuous they can
[02:16:11.160 --> 02:16:13.960]  feel like good people but they don't have to deal with any of the consequences of
[02:16:13.960 --> 02:16:17.040]  it they don't send their children to public school they don't they're not
[02:16:17.040 --> 02:16:20.000]  competing for jobs at these people they're surrounded by armed bodyguards
[02:16:20.000 --> 02:16:24.000]  that taxpayers pay for there's really no downside for them but there's a massive
[02:16:24.000 --> 02:16:27.720]  downside for everybody else they are out of touch they really don't care about
[02:16:27.720 --> 02:16:29.960]  the effect of their policies on the people they're supposed to be
[02:16:29.960 --> 02:16:33.520]  representing and we really ought to be outweighed about that and I'm hardly
[02:16:33.520 --> 02:16:36.800]  like some wild-eyed populace I think I'm pretty reasonable in mainstream but
[02:16:36.800 --> 02:16:40.720]  it's worth being mad about that matter indeed than you are then people are at
[02:16:40.720 --> 02:16:45.200]  Donald Trump like sure who's really at fault here well let's take Huma Abedin
[02:16:45.200 --> 02:16:48.440]  who I notice you have a picture behind you of her on your wall without wrangling
[02:16:48.440 --> 02:16:52.600]  brothers actually doesn't look like her Hillary Clinton special friend I don't
[02:16:52.600 --> 02:16:56.280]  care if Hillary has special friends I'm a libertarian like you are but if this
[02:16:56.280 --> 02:17:00.640]  was Trump or a conservative we know there'd be a spotlight on it and then her
[02:17:00.640 --> 02:17:04.080]  whole background she seems to just get away with everything that I think that
[02:17:04.080 --> 02:17:07.720]  also sticks in people's craw that these Democrats and establishment
[02:17:07.720 --> 02:17:11.640]  Republicans are above the law they don't get reviewed they don't get looked
[02:17:11.640 --> 02:17:16.440]  at and then Hillary's little hippo she can do whatever she wants and you know
[02:17:16.440 --> 02:17:19.240]  stay in the same hotel room or whatever I mean this should be looked into and
[02:17:19.240 --> 02:17:23.000]  then Drudge and you and others are criticized for investigating Hillary's
[02:17:23.000 --> 02:17:27.800]  health in this investigating her taste in women I mean isn't all of this open
[02:17:27.800 --> 02:17:33.120]  game Huma Abedin let's just assess the public record okay that's enough and I'm
[02:17:33.120 --> 02:17:35.800]  willing to give everyone a pass on their private lives or what do you have a
[02:17:35.800 --> 02:17:42.120]  picture of her on your wall it's from the 40s it predates even Huma she said
[02:17:42.120 --> 02:17:47.560]  on an email two days ago in which she called Donald Trump quote a racist for
[02:17:47.560 --> 02:17:52.720]  opposing Islamic immigration as if Islam is a race rather than a religion it's
[02:17:52.720 --> 02:17:57.120]  not a racial ethnic category that's insane now that is exactly the kind of
[02:17:57.120 --> 02:18:01.160]  language of rhetoric that divides people that makes people hate each other that
[02:18:01.160 --> 02:18:04.960]  whips the population into a greater frenzy again that's every bit as
[02:18:04.960 --> 02:18:08.600]  irresponsible as anything Donald Trump has suggested and unlike Donald Trump
[02:18:08.600 --> 02:18:14.320]  she's actually in a position of power I mean Huma Abedin was a federal
[02:18:14.320 --> 02:18:17.960]  official a State Department official up until pretty recently a Clinton
[02:18:17.960 --> 02:18:21.680]  administration I mean a rather an Obama administration official and yet she can
[02:18:21.680 --> 02:18:25.480]  send an email like that out and nobody cares you know it's fine it's just a
[02:18:25.480 --> 02:18:31.080]  reaction he's dangerous no wonder she's upset that it is all of this the Trump
[02:18:31.080 --> 02:18:35.400]  phenomenon is a reaction against that and I tell people who are upset a lot of
[02:18:35.400 --> 02:18:38.120]  Republicans in Washington as you know are horrified by Trump they hate him
[02:18:38.120 --> 02:18:41.360]  more than they hate Obama he's a direct threat to their power and I always say
[02:18:41.360 --> 02:18:45.040]  to them there's a reason he's here and that's because you have been a bad
[02:18:45.040 --> 02:18:48.360]  steward of this party the president has been a bad steward of the federal
[02:18:48.360 --> 02:18:51.200]  government a lot of the business community have been bad stewards of the
[02:18:51.200 --> 02:18:55.320]  economy the people running things haven't done a very good job so it shouldn't
[02:18:55.320 --> 02:18:58.800]  surprise you that someone like Donald Trump arrives on the scene and gets
[02:18:58.800 --> 02:19:01.800]  really popular by telling the truth about your failures like why is that
[02:19:01.800 --> 02:19:06.560]  shocking Tucker Carlson's our guest Fox News Fox News dot com daily caller dot
[02:19:06.560 --> 02:19:10.360]  com that's got to be the quote of the last week or so the most crystallized
[02:19:10.360 --> 02:19:15.080]  boil down truth that last 20 seconds that's it they don't dislike him because
[02:19:15.080 --> 02:19:19.160]  he's a bigot or he's hateful they hate him because he'll win he's not part of
[02:19:19.160 --> 02:19:22.560]  their power structure they've been caught working with the Democrats and he
[02:19:22.560 --> 02:19:26.840]  represents the Tea Party the libertarians taking over the grand old party
[02:19:26.840 --> 02:19:32.760]  and kicking you know these weasels out of Toad Hall who have invaded and taken
[02:19:32.760 --> 02:19:37.480]  over and he is a bellwether of that and they're panicking what's so funny is
[02:19:37.480 --> 02:19:41.440]  there in a lather this morning about the idea that he might run third party
[02:19:41.440 --> 02:19:45.880]  here's a news slash he already is running third party he's already broken with
[02:19:45.880 --> 02:19:49.160]  Republican orthodoxy on economics he's attacked the hedge fund people he's
[02:19:49.160 --> 02:19:52.720]  broken with them on foreign policy he's pointed out the Iraq war was a disaster
[02:19:52.720 --> 02:19:56.160]  that's not allowed but he did it anyway he's being attacked by the head of the
[02:19:56.160 --> 02:20:00.240]  RNC he's hated by donors he's hated by lobbyists he's hated by the entire
[02:20:00.240 --> 02:20:03.960]  Washington establishment and the other candidates or some of them say they won't
[02:20:03.960 --> 02:20:08.240]  vote for him he's not he's not running as a Republican here's a newsflash and
[02:20:08.240 --> 02:20:12.280]  maybe that's why he's succeeding because the again I've always kind of voted
[02:20:12.280 --> 02:20:15.720]  Republican because I don't see the choice but the truth is the Republican
[02:20:15.720 --> 02:20:20.360]  coalition for 40 years has been a combination of libertarian economic
[02:20:20.360 --> 02:20:24.960]  policy and neoconservative foreign policy and neither one has worked for a lot
[02:20:24.960 --> 02:20:28.360]  of people in the middle of the country that's just the truth okay and it's not
[02:20:28.360 --> 02:20:31.680]  delivering and if we don't watch out we're gonna get a Bernie Sanders or a
[02:20:31.680 --> 02:20:35.400]  Hillary we can't stand it and so the Republicans I think ought to back off
[02:20:35.400 --> 02:20:39.960]  reassess what's happening really try to talk to Trump bring them in then he
[02:20:39.960 --> 02:20:43.560]  would listen to them but now that I know some of the inside baseball three or
[02:20:43.560 --> 02:20:46.800]  four months ago I wasn't sure about Trump a month ago I wasn't but now that
[02:20:46.800 --> 02:20:51.000]  like you said going after the hedge fund boys that's the top of the pyramid
[02:20:51.000 --> 02:20:56.920]  that's the too big to fails he is really showing the fact that he's going
[02:20:56.920 --> 02:21:00.120]  after the establishment and now threatening them to go third-party if
[02:21:00.120 --> 02:21:05.280]  they don't stop demonizing him and shrilly trying to outdo MSNBC I mean
[02:21:05.280 --> 02:21:09.240]  Lindsey Graham and all these Republicans and I hate to say it even some people I've
[02:21:09.240 --> 02:21:12.400]  supported are trying to sound more like Democrats than anybody ever heard
[02:21:12.400 --> 02:21:16.280]  they're not gonna win like that I mean how stupid are they don't they get the
[02:21:16.280 --> 02:21:20.760]  mainstream media is the last group you want endorsing you exactly the Trump
[02:21:20.760 --> 02:21:24.640]  is radical because he's not tied to anyone so take for example carried
[02:21:24.640 --> 02:21:28.740]  interest it's a loophole in the tax code that allows some people in the in the
[02:21:28.740 --> 02:21:32.760]  finance business a hedge fund managers among others to take their income as
[02:21:32.760 --> 02:21:36.280]  investment dividends in other words they pay half the tax that the rest of us
[02:21:36.280 --> 02:21:39.960]  wage earners pay now this is obviously wrong they won't even defend it in
[02:21:39.960 --> 02:21:43.840]  public I'm not I'm pro-capitalist and I'm opposed to it it's indefensible and
[02:21:43.840 --> 02:21:47.880]  yet seven years under the Obama administration a supposedly radical
[02:21:47.880 --> 02:21:51.920]  left-wing redistribution administration they've allowed this to remain in the
[02:21:51.920 --> 02:21:56.520]  tax code they've never gone after it for seven years okay it took Donald Trump
[02:21:56.520 --> 02:22:00.880]  to stand up a billionaire obviously a beneficiary of capitalism say this is
[02:22:00.880 --> 02:22:05.560]  totally unfair tax exempt when when when housewives and working mothers and
[02:22:05.560 --> 02:22:09.960]  people are paying 20% tax you can't be tax exempt bozos there's not gonna be an
[02:22:09.960 --> 02:22:14.880]  economy if you keep setting the playing field where it's crooked exactly but I
[02:22:14.880 --> 02:22:18.960]  think people underestimate how radical it is for the Republican front-runner to
[02:22:18.960 --> 02:22:22.800]  say this or even to make an obvious point you know he's not attacking our
[02:22:22.800 --> 02:22:27.360]  soldiers or even Bush or Cheney he's just pointing out what the Iraq war didn't go
[02:22:27.360 --> 02:22:31.320]  that well and would you do it again of course not that's a stupid question even
[02:22:31.320 --> 02:22:35.560]  to ask and yet he was the only one in the Republican field who would say
[02:22:35.560 --> 02:22:40.040]  something that obvious that's right overall he's a true a true maverick let
[02:22:40.040 --> 02:22:43.640]  me ask you this then yes I mean in your gut you're not making predictions here
[02:22:43.640 --> 02:22:45.960]  Tucker but you're a smart political analyst you made a lot of accurate
[02:22:45.960 --> 02:22:50.200]  predictions what do you think this in your gut is gonna end up happening with
[02:22:50.200 --> 02:22:54.520]  Trump where is this going because just as a spectator just from that position
[02:22:54.520 --> 02:22:59.840]  this is fantastical for the news cycle I mean every five minutes it's something
[02:22:59.840 --> 02:23:04.280]  new where is this going it's the media full employment act it's unbelievable I
[02:23:04.280 --> 02:23:07.320]  have been usually right in my predictions not cuz I'm so smart because
[02:23:07.320 --> 02:23:10.560]  it's pretty easy to predict what's gonna happen in American politics it always
[02:23:10.560 --> 02:23:13.920]  has been I'll be honest with you I don't know what's going to happen my only
[02:23:13.920 --> 02:23:18.400]  prediction is this if he wins the Florida primary which is far more important
[02:23:18.400 --> 02:23:21.960]  than any other it's a state you can't become president without winning it's
[02:23:21.960 --> 02:23:25.440]  far more representative of the country than Iowa or New Hampshire if he wins
[02:23:25.440 --> 02:23:29.880]  that in a state where Jeb was the governor and Marco Rubio is a sitting
[02:23:29.880 --> 02:23:34.000]  senator how can you deny him the nomination if he wins that's when you'll
[02:23:34.000 --> 02:23:38.160]  know in March the Florida primary if Trump is still in and wins that he will
[02:23:38.160 --> 02:23:42.600]  be the nominee well he's now gone on national television and said it's not
[02:23:42.600 --> 02:23:47.800]  about their religion it is about safety and in his full speech he said they're
[02:23:47.800 --> 02:23:50.080]  not vetting him they're not checking him that's why we got to do it for a
[02:23:50.080 --> 02:23:53.800]  limited time till it's fixed he let them take him out of context but the way
[02:23:53.800 --> 02:23:57.640]  people then get mad at him then they find out what he really said then they
[02:23:57.640 --> 02:24:01.320]  get mad at the controlled media I mean even I when I first saw the headline a
[02:24:01.320 --> 02:24:05.160]  few days ago a day and a half ago thought oh he's crazy and then you find out
[02:24:05.160 --> 02:24:10.000]  what he really said it just reminds you how much they will spend and deceive now
[02:24:10.000 --> 02:24:13.000]  remember since we mentioned this here's Trump a couple months ago saying we've
[02:24:13.000 --> 02:24:16.200]  got to take the refugees because of what they've been through so here's
[02:24:16.200 --> 02:24:20.000]  here's Donald Trump before he has the facts shooting his mouth off saying we
[02:24:20.000 --> 02:24:23.800]  got to take the refugees then he goes to the extreme of saying you know we can't
[02:24:23.800 --> 02:24:28.440]  take them till it's fixed here it is look from a humanitarian standpoint I'd
[02:24:28.440 --> 02:24:32.400]  love to help but we have our own problems we have so many problems that we
[02:24:32.400 --> 02:24:36.760]  have to solve you have over there the Gulf states tremendously wealthy you have
[02:24:36.760 --> 02:24:42.320]  five groups of people that's the walk back a week later that's him going on I
[02:24:42.320 --> 02:24:48.240]  think that's Fox News walking it back he yeah on Hannity there's another one where
[02:24:48.240 --> 02:24:52.480]  he gives a speech where he says quote we've got to take them go ahead Tucker
[02:24:52.480 --> 02:24:55.680]  sorry well it's just not surprising Americans are compassionate people and
[02:24:55.680 --> 02:24:59.080]  their their first instinct is always to help I mean you're walking through mid
[02:24:59.080 --> 02:25:03.160]  10 Manhattan and a Japanese tourist no English says where's Times Square 20
[02:25:03.160 --> 02:25:05.760]  people rush to help them and that's just kind of who we are so it's not
[02:25:05.760 --> 02:25:08.920]  surprising that anybody asked that question from a dead sleep would say
[02:25:08.920 --> 02:25:12.840]  yeah of course we should help them the the question is not is that your instinct
[02:25:12.840 --> 02:25:15.560]  the question is knowing all the facts and watching what happened in Paris and
[02:25:15.560 --> 02:25:19.120]  watching the failure to assimilate of these large Muslim populations in
[02:25:19.120 --> 02:25:22.520]  Europe do you still think it's a good idea then and here's my question is
[02:25:22.520 --> 02:25:27.560]  Trump's position more reckless and crazy than the mainstream position which is
[02:25:27.560 --> 02:25:31.000]  despite all the evidence let's just invite thousands of Syrians right from
[02:25:31.000 --> 02:25:35.320]  the battlefield to come to America at taxpayer expense literally flown over on
[02:25:35.320 --> 02:25:40.640]  American aircraft at your expense to go on welfare is which which one of these
[02:25:40.640 --> 02:25:44.760]  positions is nuttier and I don't know again I'm not endorsing Trump for
[02:25:44.760 --> 02:25:48.280]  president hardly there are a lot of things about Trump I don't like but on the
[02:25:48.280 --> 02:25:52.840]  merits Trump's position is less crazy than that position that position is just
[02:25:52.840 --> 02:25:57.040]  flat-out anti-American and by the way the Constitution does not require us to
[02:25:57.040 --> 02:26:00.400]  commit suicide there's no amendment it's not a suicide pact in fact I did find
[02:26:00.400 --> 02:26:03.360]  the one of the articles front-page magazine it was from one of the debates
[02:26:03.360 --> 02:26:07.560]  we'll put it on screen for folks we have the actual quote for TV viewers for
[02:26:07.560 --> 02:26:11.320]  radio listeners I'll read it out Trump Rubio Bush we should take in Syrian
[02:26:11.320 --> 02:26:17.040]  refugees Trump quote on a humanitarian basis something does have to be done so
[02:26:17.040 --> 02:26:22.480]  there he was before all these people got shot and blown up in in Europe and the
[02:26:22.480 --> 02:26:26.200]  United States and what is Obama thinking Tucker let me ask you this question if
[02:26:26.200 --> 02:26:29.560]  you bring in hundreds of thousands of these people who are mainly Sunnis from
[02:26:29.560 --> 02:26:32.880]  war zones a lot of them soldiers a lot of them ISIS on you know it keeps coming
[02:26:32.880 --> 02:26:36.400]  out you bring millions into Europe don't they know there's going to be more
[02:26:36.400 --> 02:26:40.600]  attacks how will they politically get away with this and why would they want
[02:26:40.600 --> 02:26:44.360]  to do this it's so destructive well they they get away with it politically
[02:26:44.360 --> 02:26:47.200]  because they changed the composition of the electorate over time and that's
[02:26:47.200 --> 02:26:51.320]  exactly as you know what's happened since 1965 when immigration law changed to
[02:26:51.320 --> 02:26:54.440]  favor people from outside of Europe and there are probably some good things
[02:26:54.440 --> 02:26:57.000]  about that there are also some bad things about it which we never mentioned
[02:26:57.000 --> 02:26:59.760]  we lie about it and pretend it's all good because we get better restaurants and
[02:26:59.760 --> 02:27:03.880]  cheap servants but the truth is it was a massive boon for the Democratic Party
[02:27:03.880 --> 02:27:06.280]  because the overwhelming majority of those immigrants in the last 50 years
[02:27:06.280 --> 02:27:10.400]  have become Democrats and state Democrats but it has made the country less
[02:27:10.400 --> 02:27:14.240]  cohesive and more divided and there have been all kinds of other unattractive
[02:27:14.240 --> 02:27:18.000]  effects of it it's affected our education system it's affected our economy in
[02:27:18.000 --> 02:27:21.960]  ways that are bad and really troubling over the long term I mean but from a
[02:27:21.960 --> 02:27:25.800]  Democratic point of view if you're David Pluff planning out you know how to win
[02:27:25.800 --> 02:27:31.000]  the White House unto the generations for the next nine cycles your first your
[02:27:31.000 --> 02:27:35.520]  go-to position is more immigration from the third world because that means more
[02:27:35.520 --> 02:27:38.900]  Democratic voters and I know I always give people the benefit of the doubt on
[02:27:38.900 --> 02:27:41.760]  motive I don't know what motivates people most of the time and I tried not to
[02:27:41.760 --> 02:27:45.400]  pretend that I do but on this specific subject having talked to these guys a
[02:27:45.400 --> 02:27:49.960]  lot lead me see immigration as a way to change the demographics of the country in
[02:27:49.960 --> 02:27:52.920]  a way that helps them that's just yeah I mean if you take third world
[02:27:52.920 --> 02:27:56.200]  populations and you know they work hard they get a job the American dream
[02:27:56.200 --> 02:28:01.440]  they're great you indoctrinate them into socialist chip on the shoulder you
[02:28:01.440 --> 02:28:05.440]  know trigger word garbage where they can't see a Christmas tree or they fall
[02:28:05.440 --> 02:28:10.360]  down literally crying no not Halloween don't let them have a party and then
[02:28:10.360 --> 02:28:13.880]  they you know the Yale professors have stepped down now they're creating a
[02:28:13.880 --> 02:28:17.360]  freakazoid cult yeah what about the political correctness I mean I love
[02:28:17.360 --> 02:28:21.640]  Trump because he's the opposite of that well he is the problem with the
[02:28:21.640 --> 02:28:24.920]  political correctness on campus and it's not just on campus but it starts
[02:28:24.920 --> 02:28:29.120]  there is that it's really an attack on speech I understand I've got a minority
[02:28:29.120 --> 02:28:33.200]  view on politics my views are not popular with most people I don't pretend
[02:28:33.200 --> 02:28:37.680]  they are I'm way out by myself I get it and it doesn't bother me the only thing
[02:28:37.680 --> 02:28:42.200]  the line that the left crosses that makes me worried really upset is when they
[02:28:42.200 --> 02:28:45.800]  try to prevent me from expressing my views when they equate opinions they
[02:28:45.800 --> 02:28:49.440]  disagree with with violence and it's exactly what trigger warnings are all
[02:28:49.440 --> 02:28:53.440]  about that's exactly what safe spaces are all about that's exactly why Laura
[02:28:53.440 --> 02:28:56.360]  Reddell Lynch the Attorney General said the other day if you criticize Islam in
[02:28:56.360 --> 02:28:59.560]  a way we don't like will prosecute you these are all attacks on freedom of

[02:29:07.360 --> 02:29:10.840]  Democrats when asked say yes there'll be limits to the First Amendment and those
[02:29:10.840 --> 02:29:15.560]  limits begin when you start offending protected groups that's scary none of us

[02:29:19.720 --> 02:29:23.560]  Tucker Carlson is our guest for one more segment I've been asking a lot of the
[02:29:23.560 --> 02:29:27.720]  questions but in the first half of this next segment it's 18 minutes long I'm
[02:29:27.720 --> 02:29:30.880]  gonna let him bring up whatever topics he wants because I want to hear what he's
[02:29:30.880 --> 02:29:34.560]  focused on what he sees coming up then I've got some other questions I want to
[02:29:34.560 --> 02:29:38.400]  go over with him what's going on with Putin talking about using nukes now on
[02:29:38.400 --> 02:29:42.160]  ISIS I know that's just rhetoric but wow what does he make up what's happening

[02:29:57.840 --> 02:30:03.440]  I'm a proud Muslim but you don't have to share my faith to share my disgust that
[02:30:03.440 --> 02:30:07.160]  was written by Hillary Clinton's right-hand woman Huma Abedin who pinned
[02:30:07.160 --> 02:30:10.920]  the email in response to Donald Trump's recent proposition to impose a complete
[02:30:10.920 --> 02:30:14.720]  and total shutdown of Muslims entering the United States you know it was the FBI
[02:30:14.720 --> 02:30:17.960]  director the head of counterterrorism and Homeland Security who all said
[02:30:17.960 --> 02:30:22.080]  under oath that they cannot properly vet people coming in from Syria but let's
[02:30:22.080 --> 02:30:26.680]  take a look at Miss Abedin back in 2012 five Republicans sent a letter to the
[02:30:26.680 --> 02:30:30.080]  Department of Homeland Security noting that three of her family members had
[02:30:30.080 --> 02:30:34.000]  very close ties to the Muslim Brotherhood she was also intimately involved
[02:30:34.000 --> 02:30:37.440]  in Hillary Clinton's email scandal and while she was at the State Department
[02:30:37.440 --> 02:30:41.880]  Miss Abedin helped our country cozy up to Sheik Yusuf al-Qa'wadi a promoter of
[02:30:41.880 --> 02:30:45.160]  jihadist terror and one of her many accomplishments while at the State
[02:30:45.160 --> 02:30:48.400]  Department was helping destroy the country of Libya I'm sure her and her
[02:30:48.400 --> 02:30:51.840]  Muslim Brotherhood friends are very proud of that achievement just imagine
[02:30:51.840 --> 02:30:55.080]  what she can do when her best pal Hillary Clinton gets into the White House

[02:35:08.640 --> 02:35:11.760]  tonight 7 o'clock Central in full or Stanley News back tomorrow with a
[02:35:11.760 --> 02:35:15.840]  weekday broadcast as well Tucker Carlson of the DailyCaller.com one of the
[02:35:15.840 --> 02:35:20.560]  founders of the owners of it joins us I could say one of the main pundits and
[02:35:20.560 --> 02:35:24.240]  analysts to on Fox News and even though Fox News has millions of viewers an hour
[02:35:24.240 --> 02:35:27.280]  I really just think it's a bigger deal to have your own successful news
[02:35:27.280 --> 02:35:30.720]  organization that has journalists all over the country and all over the world
[02:35:30.720 --> 02:35:35.960]  because the dinosaur media and Fox will be the last to go really is on its way
[02:35:35.960 --> 02:35:39.640]  out and I don't know what the establishment's gonna do in the wake of
[02:35:39.640 --> 02:35:44.080]  that I just see how arrogant and delusional even mainstream reporters
[02:35:44.080 --> 02:35:50.880]  are to this day I mean Obama's average YouTube video gets like 5,000 now when
[02:35:50.880 --> 02:35:54.360]  some you know kid reporting from it'll know where it's 5 million and it's not
[02:35:54.360 --> 02:35:59.640]  just 5 million once or twice or 10 times or 20 times it's consistently now for
[02:35:59.640 --> 02:36:04.240]  new media and I'm a well-known libertarian conspiracy theorist calling
[02:36:04.240 --> 02:36:08.240]  whatever you want I don't believe a word these people say and they also take out
[02:36:08.240 --> 02:36:12.560]  of context what we do talk about but it hasn't worked and so before Tucker gets
[02:36:12.560 --> 02:36:15.240]  into topics that I know are near and dear to his heart so I want to hear these
[02:36:15.240 --> 02:36:19.920]  wildcards I want to ask him though I don't think we can really underestimate
[02:36:19.920 --> 02:36:23.960]  because I think I did I mean I I didn't support McCain or Obama and I think
[02:36:23.960 --> 02:36:27.920]  that was a mistake even though McCain's horrible I underestimated Obama but I
[02:36:27.920 --> 02:36:31.760]  mean I look at the average Democrat now with these man on the streets we do in
[02:36:31.760 --> 02:36:36.040]  Austin and in California you know we're not in the Beltway and I mean these
[02:36:36.040 --> 02:36:40.160]  Democrats 9 out of 10 say we go for Obama we're gonna put gun owners in
[02:36:40.160 --> 02:36:45.480]  forced labor camps and we're gonna execute them I mean and they say yeah
[02:36:45.480 --> 02:36:49.000]  I'm sick of these gun owners we're like so you want to put them in prison and so
[02:36:49.000 --> 02:36:53.200]  next time we go out we want to kill them yeah let's kill them I mean look at
[02:36:53.200 --> 02:36:57.360]  people saying kill Trump these are mainline people saying go ISIS kill
[02:36:57.360 --> 02:37:00.800]  Trump and they're not even radical Muslims it just seems like it's now more
[02:37:00.800 --> 02:37:05.720]  like a dumb down power cult like the Nazis or the Soviets I don't know how to
[02:37:05.720 --> 02:37:09.760]  describe them but these aren't the Democrats I grew up around who you
[02:37:09.760 --> 02:37:13.720]  agree with on a bunch of points and you know disagree with some these are like
[02:37:13.720 --> 02:37:17.560]  deranged crazy people in my view do you agree with that or what would you call
[02:37:17.560 --> 02:37:22.400]  them or what are they mutating into you know it's a great question all the
[02:37:22.400 --> 02:37:25.680]  attention is on how the Republican Party has changed and it's more extreme and
[02:37:25.680 --> 02:37:28.640]  no it has changed in a lot of ways but not as much as the Democratic Party has
[02:37:28.640 --> 02:37:32.320]  changed the Democratic Party from our light I were about the same edge for our
[02:37:32.320 --> 02:37:37.160]  lifetimes was the party of kind of the faculty lounge affluent white
[02:37:37.160 --> 02:37:41.400]  intellectuals on college campuses of course of minority voters and of the
[02:37:41.400 --> 02:37:44.680]  poor but it was also the party of like the working man they always claimed that
[02:37:44.680 --> 02:37:47.480]  and they were right actually the average wage earner was a Democrat because he
[02:37:47.480 --> 02:37:50.840]  thought the party was on his side it is no longer that the Democratic Party is
[02:37:50.840 --> 02:37:54.880]  the party of left-wing intellectuals and of people who are wholly dependent on
[02:37:54.880 --> 02:37:58.120]  government we need government help and so of course Democratic Party is their
[02:37:58.120 --> 02:38:01.960]  natural home there's nobody in the middle they don't represent normal people
[02:38:01.960 --> 02:38:07.240]  anymore so it's a game it's a game it's a game it completely isn't so without the
[02:38:07.240 --> 02:38:13.440]  leavening effect of normal people with jobs and families and you know and maybe
[02:38:13.440 --> 02:38:17.560]  a week of deer hunting every fall they have no reference points for what's
[02:38:17.560 --> 02:38:21.680]  normal and the authoritarian impulse which has always been on the left because
[02:38:21.680 --> 02:38:25.440]  the left believes the politics is the way to improve the world in human nature
[02:38:25.440 --> 02:38:28.480]  itself so they take politics much more seriously than the right does for sure
[02:38:28.480 --> 02:38:32.640]  that authority impulse is has nothing to hold it back that's right and they it's
[02:38:32.640 --> 02:38:35.960]  in full flower and the gun issue I don't even talk about it much on the air
[02:38:35.960 --> 02:38:39.520]  because it makes me too emotional and I become tongue-tied because it makes me
[02:38:39.520 --> 02:38:43.120]  so angry bells make the obvious point I know your viewers agree with but they're
[02:38:43.120 --> 02:38:46.360]  not even pretending the gun control will make the country safer because it
[02:38:46.360 --> 02:38:50.200]  demonstrably won't or prevent terrorism it's absurd they don't even try they're
[02:38:50.200 --> 02:38:53.920]  basically just saying that anybody with a gun or certain kinds of guns is
[02:38:53.920 --> 02:38:57.720]  prima facie evil which is to say they're part of another culture one that we're
[02:38:57.720 --> 02:39:01.080]  not a part of that needs to be stamped out and destroyed and let's just go
[02:39:01.080 --> 02:39:05.840]  ahead and use this national crisis to hurt these people I mean that's kind of
[02:39:05.840 --> 02:39:08.840]  their their open pits are not even pretending anymore it's really ominous
[02:39:08.840 --> 02:39:13.160]  very well said I couldn't say it that good that crystallized again which is
[02:39:13.160 --> 02:39:17.840]  really your skill at just boiling down this they are a cult of totalitarian
[02:39:17.840 --> 02:39:24.000]  intellectuals who want total power see everyone else is an enemy they have
[02:39:24.000 --> 02:39:26.840]  radicalized their party which is radicalized the Republican Party but
[02:39:26.840 --> 02:39:30.920]  they are the real drivers of that then they have this giant constituency that
[02:39:30.920 --> 02:39:35.600]  don't work who are scared and programmed by the lies that the intellectual
[02:39:35.600 --> 02:39:41.640]  left is telling them so it's a giant gang run by a control freak cult waging
[02:39:41.640 --> 02:39:46.840]  war on the family language the individual it's it's it's a nightmare
[02:39:46.840 --> 02:39:51.840]  scenario I think that is true and the most lasting damage they will do though
[02:39:51.840 --> 02:39:57.160]  is introducing a hard kind of ethnic politics into American life where their
[02:39:57.160 --> 02:40:01.020]  appeals are explicitly racial Republicans are white they hate you they
[02:40:01.020 --> 02:40:03.840]  don't understand you they're really unreasonably racist this is the
[02:40:03.840 --> 02:40:07.560]  president's point in almost every address he gives the real threat is bigotry
[02:40:07.560 --> 02:40:11.040]  here at home it scares the hell out of people there are a lot of non-white
[02:40:11.040 --> 02:40:14.240]  voters who I think are open-minded who know they're not being served by the
[02:40:14.240 --> 02:40:17.440]  Democratic Party who might be willing to look elsewhere but they can't
[02:40:17.440 --> 02:40:20.960]  understandably they can't because they've been told for generations that the
[02:40:20.960 --> 02:40:24.800]  Republican Party hates them because of the way they look and once you think
[02:40:24.800 --> 02:40:27.800]  somebody hates you you're not open to appeals from that person or that group
[02:40:27.800 --> 02:40:32.600]  anymore you shut down right and so they've created really they've been
[02:40:32.600 --> 02:40:36.320]  instrumental in creating a really tough kind of ethnic politics that doesn't go
[02:40:36.320 --> 02:40:40.480]  away these wounds linger and the one thing you don't want in your country is
[02:40:40.480 --> 02:40:43.080]  ethnic politics because it's not resolvable if you and I disagree on an
[02:40:43.080 --> 02:40:48.280]  issue issues come and go you know they're resolved our ethnicity is immutable it
[02:40:48.280 --> 02:40:51.360]  doesn't change and so if we hate each other because of our ethnic differences
[02:40:51.360 --> 02:40:54.840]  our children will hate each other because their ethnic differences this is the
[02:40:54.840 --> 02:40:59.840]  story of world history of the tower of Babel of the broken coalition strategy
[02:40:59.840 --> 02:41:03.280]  where everyone's so divided and conquered you can never agree about a
[02:41:03.280 --> 02:41:08.240]  second amendment or private property or sovereignty or anything because you're
[02:41:08.240 --> 02:41:12.760]  just too obsessed over your identity politics exactly and that man you don't
[02:41:12.760 --> 02:41:15.680]  even it's a very effective way to mobilize voters by the way if you have a
[02:41:15.680 --> 02:41:19.480]  candidate like Hillary who doesn't have a very impressive record to run on she's
[02:41:19.480 --> 02:41:22.800]  not going to be running on her tenure as Secretary of State or her years as
[02:41:22.800 --> 02:41:26.160]  senator from New York there's nothing to talk about so she's gonna be running on
[02:41:26.160 --> 02:41:30.160]  ethnic politics identity politics entirely I'm a woman my opponent is not
[02:41:30.160 --> 02:41:33.160]  you're mad at your ex-husband vote for me or it's time to give a woman a shot
[02:41:33.160 --> 02:41:38.280]  and they're the white party you resent them they have things that are rightful
[02:41:38.280 --> 02:41:43.480]  of yours vote for me boy that works I mean it'll probably get her elected or
[02:41:43.480 --> 02:41:48.120]  it could get her elected in any case but it will have a fact that our grand
[02:41:48.120 --> 02:41:51.280]  children will be living with and that are very unhappy and very dangerous they
[02:41:51.280 --> 02:41:54.800]  shouldn't do that I've seen these news articles where it'll show like 20 30 40
[02:41:54.800 --> 02:41:58.160]  women depending on the article it'll say the women of Hillary or the women
[02:41:58.160 --> 02:42:02.400]  press of Hillary right and they admit it's ideology they do whatever she says
[02:42:02.400 --> 02:42:06.200]  because she's a woman and they're kind of advertising out in the open that
[02:42:06.200 --> 02:42:11.080]  they've gotten rid of any you know real journalistic integrity and I think a lot
[02:42:11.080 --> 02:42:15.000]  of this is because the Republicans back when my grandfather was becoming a
[02:42:15.000 --> 02:42:19.400]  Republican you know the first in the family's history in Texas he come back
[02:42:19.400 --> 02:42:23.080]  from World War two he thought it was wrong that black people are being
[02:42:23.080 --> 02:42:26.600]  discriminated against right he became a Republican ran for office and he's Texas
[02:42:26.600 --> 02:42:30.720]  won the family got mad at him but accepted it but the point was the
[02:42:30.720 --> 02:42:34.680]  Republicans passed the Civil Rights Act in the late 50s their Eisenhower
[02:42:34.680 --> 02:42:39.200]  sending in the troops to integrate the schools the Republicans have the moral
[02:42:39.200 --> 02:42:42.640]  high ground and then they start losing elections so they do the Southern
[02:42:42.640 --> 02:42:47.520]  strategy flip start acting like Democrats in the South the Democrats flip and
[02:42:47.520 --> 02:42:51.360]  then start doing minority politics they're the original party of the Klan
[02:42:51.360 --> 02:42:57.440]  the Republicans played that game for a decade got branded got set up and now
[02:42:57.440 --> 02:43:02.680]  we're dealing with the most sinister sneaky I've been around some high level
[02:43:02.680 --> 02:43:06.680]  Democrats before years ago and they're really racist cold-blooded weirdo
[02:43:06.680 --> 02:43:11.840]  criminals at the top and I've got to say that they're they're the mafia and the
[02:43:11.840 --> 02:43:15.480]  sad little Democrats just don't know who's leading them around mother knows
[02:43:15.480 --> 02:43:19.840]  I mean I'm ranting but can you speak to the party of the Klan the Democrats again
[02:43:19.840 --> 02:43:24.080]  is the key difference between the left and right is the left means it you talk
[02:43:24.080 --> 02:43:27.320]  to the average staff on a Republican campaign I'll say I really hope my
[02:43:27.320 --> 02:43:30.160]  candidate wins he's better than the other guy but if he loses I'll become a
[02:43:30.160 --> 02:43:33.040]  lobbyist to play golf or move to a mortal beach or whatever life will continue
[02:43:33.040 --> 02:43:36.160]  I'll get on with the business of my life which is not inherently political if you
[02:43:36.160 --> 02:43:40.960]  talk to the average Democratic consultant he'll say my guy is the best guy ever
[02:43:40.960 --> 02:43:44.560]  to run the other guy is evil everything hangs in the balance this will not be a
[02:43:44.560 --> 02:43:48.160]  constitutional public if we lose they invest meaning and politics that
[02:43:48.160 --> 02:43:51.200]  Republicans can't even comprehend because for your average conservative or
[02:43:51.200 --> 02:43:54.160]  libertarian or even garden variety Republican politics is something you do
[02:43:54.160 --> 02:43:58.080]  in order to create space to do the things that really matter like get married
[02:43:58.080 --> 02:44:01.480]  have children have a business go to church it's what makes that possible for
[02:44:01.480 --> 02:44:05.520]  Democrats it's an end in itself so of course they're willing to do things that
[02:44:05.520 --> 02:44:09.280]  Republicans wouldn't even conceive of doing there they're always gonna be the
[02:44:09.280 --> 02:44:13.440]  guy who cares more about something is always gonna be better at doing it and
[02:44:13.440 --> 02:44:16.880]  that's why Democrats have an inherent advantage they're only disadvantages the
[02:44:16.880 --> 02:44:20.360]  average person doesn't agree with them but really over time that doesn't matter
[02:44:20.360 --> 02:44:24.720]  because they just imported new people who do agree with that was my question do
[02:44:24.720 --> 02:44:28.200]  you agree that we've reached a crossroads and that the Republicans have been
[02:44:28.200 --> 02:44:31.200]  doing some of the right things going out and running quote minority candidates
[02:44:31.200 --> 02:44:34.320]  because I don't have your black Hispanic white just don't take my guns keep my
[02:44:34.320 --> 02:44:37.760]  taxes love you had green skin I'd vote for you for president you know if you
[02:44:37.760 --> 02:44:42.480]  weren't supporting tyranny I mean do you think we're in danger of having a one
[02:44:42.480 --> 02:44:47.600]  party system the Democrats on the national level we are not on a state
[02:44:47.600 --> 02:44:51.160]  level I mean there are plenty of states I mean Republicans have done great and
[02:44:51.160 --> 02:44:54.520]  maybe not that it's really mattered but they've done great in the last three
[02:44:54.520 --> 02:44:57.840]  cycles in the states they have more governorships and they've had in
[02:44:57.840 --> 02:45:01.720]  generations they have more state houses if they have obviously a big majority in
[02:45:01.720 --> 02:45:05.560]  Congress biggest in 70 years etc etc but for a national election a
[02:45:05.560 --> 02:45:08.720]  presidential election the math is such that it's gonna be very difficult and
[02:45:08.720 --> 02:45:12.400]  most Republicans know this on a gut level to win after this cycle simply
[02:45:12.400 --> 02:45:15.480]  because the demographics are just so very different much more different than
[02:45:15.480 --> 02:45:19.160]  people understand the average person I'm included lives in a neighborhood that
[02:45:19.160 --> 02:45:22.400]  kind of looks like the neighborhood you grew up in same kind of people but
[02:45:22.400 --> 02:45:26.320]  that's not America once you get outside of your own little bubble and see the
[02:45:26.320 --> 02:45:29.240]  country you see that it's totally different and by the way that's not all
[02:45:29.240 --> 02:45:33.400]  bad not all changes every all changes a mixed blessing some of it is good but
[02:45:33.400 --> 02:45:37.360]  from a political point of view it is absolutely death for the Republicans
[02:45:37.360 --> 02:45:41.520]  that was the plan from day one they ignored it or didn't know about it and
[02:45:41.520 --> 02:45:45.840]  now they're staring down the barrel of elections they can't win and the
[02:45:45.840 --> 02:45:49.480]  consequences obviously the consequences are that the things that we've taken
[02:45:49.480 --> 02:45:52.960]  for granted I mean the core things we took for good the right to bear arms the
[02:45:52.960 --> 02:45:56.520]  right to speak freely the right to disagree with the majority the right to
[02:45:56.520 --> 02:45:59.920]  assemble the right to privacy things that we thought were constitutionally
[02:45:59.920 --> 02:46:04.960]  guaranteed suddenly nobody cares that's right and now you can see and now the
[02:46:04.960 --> 02:46:08.800]  Democrats know they're just an election or two away from total domination right
[02:46:08.800 --> 02:46:14.240]  you see the criminal energy the crazed eyes the we're gonna arrest you we're
[02:46:14.240 --> 02:46:18.180]  gonna kill you we're gonna take your guns I mean you're I mean it really is
[02:46:18.180 --> 02:46:23.440]  brown shirt energy I'm seeing and man it's really frightening well it's
[02:46:23.440 --> 02:46:27.520]  power worship and in the end all power worship looks the same you can dress it
[02:46:27.520 --> 02:46:32.400]  up as Bolshevism or Islamism or whatever you want to call it but it's
[02:46:32.400 --> 02:46:37.440]  always the same it's you will do my bidding you will act out my will or you
[02:46:37.440 --> 02:46:42.920]  will be crushed and by the way all of this here's okay my my core belief is
[02:46:42.920 --> 02:46:48.880]  that the Islamist movement is a reaction against massive changes in the world
[02:46:48.880 --> 02:46:53.880]  economy so you had an agrarian world that was totally overturned by the
[02:46:53.880 --> 02:46:57.640]  industrial revolution it displaced a lot of people you had a lot of anxiety and
[02:46:57.640 --> 02:47:00.640]  out of that you got Bolshevism you got worldwide communism which lasted for
[02:47:00.640 --> 02:47:04.520]  70 years that ended we have another massive change going from an industrial
[02:47:04.520 --> 02:47:07.680]  economy to a digital economy people are completely freaked out and they're
[02:47:07.680 --> 02:47:11.440]  seeking solace in nations that haven't been able to compete in the digital
[02:47:11.440 --> 02:47:16.280]  economy mostly the Middle East and in Africa they're taking solace in Islamism
[02:47:16.280 --> 02:47:21.880]  this is not just a religious movement it's a reaction against radical global
[02:47:21.880 --> 02:47:26.880]  change and that makes that's meaningful because it makes it so much more
[02:47:26.880 --> 02:47:31.400]  dangerous this could pop up anywhere it's a way for people who are not
[02:47:31.400 --> 02:47:36.080]  succeeding in this new world to say yes my life has meaning I'm gonna strike out
[02:47:36.080 --> 02:47:39.440]  against people who are succeeding who I'm envious of who I think are
[02:47:39.440 --> 02:47:43.040]  responsible responsible for my failure I mean this is a big thing you need to
[02:47:43.040 --> 02:47:48.840]  think about this in terms of the Cold War 1952 this is an existential threat
[02:47:48.840 --> 02:47:54.240]  to the Western way of life I really believe that Tucker Carlson thank you
[02:47:54.240 --> 02:47:58.440]  so much for the time in the minute we've got left any other points that we
[02:47:58.440 --> 02:48:02.400]  should know about that you're looking at that are on the radar screen the only
[02:48:02.400 --> 02:48:07.480]  thing I would say is I recently changed my view on guns and I think the lever
[02:48:07.480 --> 02:48:14.040]  action 357 38 is this single flattish shooting nicest gun I've ever owned and
[02:48:14.040 --> 02:48:17.680]  I have a lot of different rifles up in Maine I have my own shooting range this
[02:48:17.680 --> 02:48:22.480]  gun is fantastic you can deer hunt with it in the 357 the ammo is literally
[02:48:22.480 --> 02:48:26.720]  cheaper 38 is literally cheaper than a high-end 22s right now it's just a
[02:48:26.720 --> 02:48:29.880]  terrific gun it's often overlooked because people think it's so old-fashioned
[02:48:29.880 --> 02:48:35.720]  I gotta have a black gun I gotta have an M4 which is that it's a Rossi lever
[02:48:35.720 --> 02:48:39.960]  action 357 I've got one of those it's not Rossi but those are great you can
[02:48:39.960 --> 02:48:44.240]  even shoot wild hogs with us you can and it's totally cheap it's like 400 bucks
[02:48:44.240 --> 02:48:50.160]  it's flat shooting it no recoil it's just a fantastic rifle and the ammo is
[02:48:50.160 --> 02:48:53.160]  going to be the last to be banned I'm totally convinced of course you own
[02:48:53.160 --> 02:48:59.720]  stock in Rossi yes I wish I did I wish I did Rossi has some nice handguns and
[02:48:59.720 --> 02:49:03.880]  shotguns and rifles very inexpensive I love them I probably got I was kind of
[02:49:03.880 --> 02:49:07.280]  sickening how many guns on it's one of the things I love that I'm kind of the
[02:49:07.280 --> 02:49:11.560]  ameldo Marcus of shoes with guns I got so many guns I don't want to say the
[02:49:11.560 --> 02:49:17.600]  number well I mean luckily I've never come any
[02:49:17.600 --> 02:49:22.240]  crimes with them and it's a collection but hey who knows yeah it's an evil
[02:49:22.240 --> 02:49:26.880]  arsenal Tucker Carlson daily caller.com thank you so much thanks I appreciate it

[02:50:13.000 --> 02:50:17.920]  analysis and this is the winner of a thousand dollars and what I'm doing is
[02:50:17.920 --> 02:50:21.680]  I'm doing more and more of these quick contest or two or three days we just had
[02:50:21.680 --> 02:50:26.120]  one for a thousand dollars that was the best war on Christmas meme and showed
[02:50:26.120 --> 02:50:30.280]  the Marines at Iwo Jima hoisting up a Christmas tree and we said come and take
[02:50:30.280 --> 02:50:34.760]  it and it's just about getting folks involved the fun of it rewarding some
[02:50:34.760 --> 02:50:37.520]  of the people that do the best but everybody wins by engaging in free
[02:50:37.520 --> 02:50:42.440]  speech in free expression that is what will counter this globalist dark age
[02:50:42.440 --> 02:50:47.520]  they're trying to bring in and then runner up is Kenneth Webb who of course
[02:50:47.520 --> 02:50:51.000]  has changed the channel it has much my documentaries posted I think there's
[02:50:51.000 --> 02:50:55.120]  like 40 million views of my documentaries on his channel just another
[02:50:55.120 --> 02:50:59.520]  channel out there that has our videos with like 40 million views again just
[02:50:59.520 --> 02:51:04.520]  letting you know we are the media we are dominant now we're bigger than CNN and
[02:51:04.520 --> 02:51:09.960]  MSNBC combined can you think about that we just got three or four shows we're
[02:51:09.960 --> 02:51:15.880]  only here five hours a day and we are clearly now bigger than CNN domestically
[02:51:15.880 --> 02:51:21.480]  and MSNBC we are bigger than any one Fox show with two three four million viewers
[02:51:21.480 --> 02:51:26.440]  their top shows but look at how arrogant Bill O'Reilly is up there but I love
[02:51:26.440 --> 02:51:31.080]  that fact and in a year will be bigger than Fox I mean that's why the system is
[02:51:31.080 --> 02:51:36.520]  panicking folks that's why these things are happening because we're just a
[02:51:36.520 --> 02:51:41.160]  bellwether info wars is just one little one little organization out there that
[02:51:41.160 --> 02:51:47.040]  is indicative of the establishment in freefall right now now let's go ahead

[02:51:53.240 --> 02:51:56.800]  minutes of your radio listeners you can see it for yourself at your leisure but
[02:51:56.800 --> 02:52:04.640]  the winner of the Obama Oval Office speech analysis contest will come with a
[02:52:04.640 --> 02:52:07.800]  better name I think I forget the exact name of the contest I'm just doing these
[02:52:07.800 --> 02:52:12.240]  so quick now but to hear it is hi it's Rupert today's episode is brought to you
[02:52:12.240 --> 02:52:20.320]  by bugs and killers and also this is my analysis of President Obama's San Bernardino
[02:52:20.320 --> 02:52:24.040]  speech I will start off with the speeches most blatant contradiction so far
[02:52:24.040 --> 02:52:27.520]  we have no evidence that the killers were directed by a terrorist organization
[02:52:27.520 --> 02:52:32.040]  overseas or that they were part of a broader conspiracy here at home we see
[02:52:32.040 --> 02:52:36.880]  growing efforts by terrorists to poison the minds of people like the Boston
[02:52:36.880 --> 02:52:42.000]  Marathon bombers and the San Bernardino killers okay so which is it there is or
[02:52:42.000 --> 02:52:46.960]  isn't an influence from overseas but it is clear that the two of them have had
[02:52:46.960 --> 02:52:50.400]  gone down the dark path of radicalization and where is this exactly
[02:52:50.400 --> 02:52:53.800]  I'm on the internet all the time I've never seen anything like that of you in
[02:52:53.800 --> 02:52:57.320]  the next few clips he's actually reminding us that he is in charge of the
[02:52:57.320 --> 02:53:00.400]  military his commander-in-chief I have no greater responsibility than the
[02:53:00.400 --> 02:53:03.800]  security of the American people wait a minute that sounds a little familiar in
[02:53:03.800 --> 02:53:08.200]  the process we've hardened our defenses from airports to financial centers to
[02:53:08.200 --> 02:53:11.800]  other critical infrastructure intelligence and law enforcement agencies
[02:53:11.800 --> 02:53:17.040]  have disrupted countless plots here and overseas and worked around the clock to
[02:53:17.040 --> 02:53:21.000]  keep us safe oh yeah I know where I've heard that before oh what's that guy's
[02:53:21.000 --> 02:53:27.200]  name George Bush we will destroy ISIL and any other organization that tries to
[02:53:27.200 --> 02:53:33.160]  harm us as far as I'm concerned this is a George Bush speech first our military
[02:53:33.160 --> 02:53:37.200]  will continue to hunt down terrorist plotters in any country where it is
[02:53:37.200 --> 02:53:41.400]  necessary and that right there is a very George Bush like declaration of war on
[02:53:41.400 --> 02:53:45.720]  everybody terrorists turn to less complicated acts of violence like the
[02:53:45.720 --> 02:53:49.480]  mass shootings that are all too common in our society what he's saying is they've
[02:53:49.480 --> 02:53:53.240]  got the airports locked down but they're still coming for you at the mall it
[02:53:53.240 --> 02:53:57.560]  is this type of attack that we saw at Fort Hood in 2009 all right I guess we
[02:53:57.560 --> 02:54:01.440]  can call that a terrorist attack now and since the day I took this office I
[02:54:01.440 --> 02:54:06.720]  have authorized US forces to take out terrorists abroad take that you confused
[02:54:06.720 --> 02:54:11.720]  anti-war Obama supporters are closest allies including France Germany and the
[02:54:11.720 --> 02:54:15.280]  United Kingdom together with 65 countries that have joined an American-led
[02:54:15.280 --> 02:54:19.320]  coalition so we've got a 65 country coalition and a declaration of war on
[02:54:19.320 --> 02:54:23.960]  everybody can we just go ahead and call this World War 3 yet we will continue to
[02:54:23.960 --> 02:54:28.000]  provide training and equipment to tens of thousands of Iraqi and Syrian forces
[02:54:28.000 --> 02:54:31.200]  I got a better idea why don't you try providing people here with training and
[02:54:31.200 --> 02:54:35.520]  equipment to begin with Congress should act to make sure no one on a no fly
[02:54:35.520 --> 02:54:41.240]  list is able to buy a gun really how is the no fly list now not the no gun list
[02:54:41.240 --> 02:54:46.080]  I think we should add a third random thing to the list like tacos hey man
[02:54:46.080 --> 02:54:49.480]  you want to go get Mexican food oh man you know I can't I'm on the no taco we
[02:54:49.480 --> 02:54:52.960]  should put in place stronger screening for those who come to America without a
[02:54:52.960 --> 02:54:56.040]  visa raise your hand if you didn't know you could do that so that we can take a
[02:54:56.040 --> 02:54:59.640]  hard look at whether they've traveled to war zones I'll just ask them I'm sure
[02:54:59.640 --> 02:55:02.400]  they'll tell you now even though earlier this week some guy was like this
[02:55:02.400 --> 02:55:08.200]  guy is such a pussy I don't remember George Bush doing he's actually asking
[02:55:08.200 --> 02:55:12.520]  for a declaration of war if Congress believes as I do that we are at war
[02:55:12.520 --> 02:55:17.120]  with ISIL it should go ahead and vote to authorize the continued use of
[02:55:17.120 --> 02:55:21.680]  military force against these terrorists we should not be drawn once more into a
[02:55:21.680 --> 02:55:25.960]  long and costly ground war that is code for they're going to spend a lot of
[02:55:25.960 --> 02:55:30.120]  money on technology and they are going to bomb the crap out of some people then
[02:55:30.120 --> 02:55:33.560]  I can't help but feel like he's proselytizing for Islam a bit we cannot
[02:55:33.560 --> 02:55:38.680]  turn against one another by letting this fight be defined as a war between
[02:55:38.680 --> 02:55:42.760]  America and Islam including millions of patriotic Muslim Americans for the
[02:55:42.760 --> 02:55:46.280]  vast majority of terrorist victims around the world are Muslim we must
[02:55:46.280 --> 02:55:50.280]  enlist Muslim communities rather than push them away that's cool but can
[02:55:50.280 --> 02:55:54.000]  Christians Buddhists and Hindus get a shout out to separation of church and
[02:55:54.000 --> 02:55:58.160]  state let's not forget that freedom is more powerful than fear that we have
[02:55:58.160 --> 02:56:02.880]  always met challenges whether war or depression natural disasters or
[02:56:02.880 --> 02:56:07.640]  terrorist attacks by coming together I have no doubt that America will prevail
[02:56:07.640 --> 02:56:12.280]  so it's blatantly obvious to me that this speech is about using the no-fly
[02:56:12.280 --> 02:56:17.480]  list as a no-gun list and it's also a speech about Obama getting ready to use
[02:56:17.480 --> 02:56:22.040]  the military in a more massive way than he ever has I will always refer to this
[02:56:22.040 --> 02:56:26.120]  speech as Obama's George Bush speech he is evoking his power as commander in
[02:56:26.120 --> 02:56:29.720]  chief however it's being done so in such a manner because of his constituency
[02:56:29.720 --> 02:56:33.320]  alright ladies and gentlemen thank you for watching episode 60 of Hyatt's

[03:02:50.320 --> 03:02:54.040]  could possibly be the argument for allowing a terrorist suspect to buy a
[03:02:54.040 --> 03:02:57.920]  semi-automatic weapon whoa let me get this straight you mean that if you're a
[03:02:57.920 --> 03:03:02.280]  no-fly list terrorist watch list watch being the key word here people no one's

[03:08:50.600 --> 03:08:55.400]  good news is there's actually no such thing by the way as internet censorship
[03:08:55.400 --> 03:09:01.640]  in China according to China China's top sensor actually just released a statement
[03:09:01.640 --> 03:09:05.560]  the senior Chinese official known as the gatekeeper of the country's internet has
[03:09:05.560 --> 03:09:10.000]  denied that the country's sensors online information Lu Wei chief of state
[03:09:10.000 --> 03:09:13.920]  internet information office said China does not censor but manages internet
[03:09:13.920 --> 03:09:18.300]  content so I have good news for you there's no such thing as internet
[03:09:18.300 --> 03:09:23.040]  censorship in the United States either or in the world just anywhere at all it's
[03:09:23.040 --> 03:09:28.240]  only managed so when you go to post something online it's blocked or is
[03:09:28.240 --> 03:09:31.840]  taken down on YouTube or Facebook or whatever that's actually not censorship
[03:09:31.840 --> 03:09:37.200]  good news guys that's just managed content the government manages it to keep
[03:09:37.200 --> 03:09:41.160]  you safe so that's some uplifting news but no seriously we're gonna get into
[03:09:41.160 --> 03:09:45.280]  some other news about petition to ban Trump from the UK passes 250k signatures
[03:09:45.280 --> 03:09:49.200]  could he be actually banned in the United Kingdom I wonder if that was still
[03:09:49.200 --> 03:09:52.200]  hold if he's president that would be interesting Google says it has proved
[03:09:52.200 --> 03:09:55.320]  its controversial quantum computer really works and it could do math better
[03:09:55.320 --> 03:09:59.800]  than a conventional computer anonymous couple drops $500,000 into a
[03:09:59.800 --> 03:10:03.480]  Salvation Army Kettle outside of a small restaurant we're gonna talk about how
[03:10:03.480 --> 03:10:07.200]  Putin we spoke about this a little bit earlier but we're gonna expand on how
[03:10:07.200 --> 03:10:12.920]  he's going to become a non-gmo dominant exporter and in Kazakhstan the
[03:10:12.920 --> 03:10:17.840]  internet backdoors you they want to install some type of a chip or software
[03:10:17.840 --> 03:10:21.280]  and I'll have to read into it and where it tracks everything on your personal
[03:10:21.280 --> 03:10:24.880]  devices this is kind of like a beta test of what some people want to do in the
[03:10:24.880 --> 03:10:29.200]  United States where every single thing you do on your personal device whether
[03:10:29.200 --> 03:10:34.160]  it's a cell phone or a computer or a lap you know iPad or whatever it all goes
[03:10:34.160 --> 03:10:38.520]  through the government cloud and it tracks everything you look up everything
[03:10:38.520 --> 03:10:42.440]  you are interested in everything you like everything you do just tracks you
[03:10:42.440 --> 03:10:46.640]  100% completely we also have some uplifting news but Dr. Group is
[03:10:46.640 --> 03:10:50.240]  gonna talk to us about some really really important health information on
[03:10:50.240 --> 03:10:56.000]  detoxing on avoiding the average of five pounds that we all gain during the
[03:10:56.000 --> 03:11:01.560]  holidays right and some of the reasons that were secretly you know unknowingly
[03:11:01.560 --> 03:11:04.600]  packing on the weight feeling like crap over the holidays when we actually do
[03:11:04.600 --> 03:11:09.000]  about it so yeah now you know coming knowing I was going to be on the show
[03:11:09.000 --> 03:11:13.320]  today I was like what can I do for people the holidays are coming up you
[03:11:13.320 --> 03:11:16.200]  know sometimes I come on the show we promote the products which are great
[03:11:16.200 --> 03:11:22.040]  but I really want to give back to everybody and just say put together a
[03:11:22.040 --> 03:11:25.600]  lot of facts and put together some tips that everybody can learn about the
[03:11:25.600 --> 03:11:28.280]  holidays and what they can do to be healthy during the holidays how they
[03:11:28.280 --> 03:11:32.600]  can replace some of the toxic foods with some natural foods how they can reduce
[03:11:32.600 --> 03:11:35.200]  their stress levels over the holidays because I know they're probably gonna
[03:11:35.200 --> 03:11:40.560]  have parents and you know mother-in-laws and everything coming in so it's not
[03:11:40.560 --> 03:11:46.000]  only having a non-toxic holiday season but it's also you know how do you deal
[03:11:46.000 --> 03:11:50.800]  with all this stuff that's going on and so I put together some things that I
[03:11:50.800 --> 03:11:54.600]  like to share with everybody a few years ago consumers were consumer reports
[03:11:54.600 --> 03:11:59.800]  did a survey on what Americans dread the most about the holidays they dread the
[03:11:59.800 --> 03:12:07.200]  most going in debt dealing with crowds and gaining weight and according to the
[03:12:07.200 --> 03:12:11.720]  National Cancer of Health statistics over 30% of American adults are
[03:12:11.720 --> 03:12:15.680]  overweight another 30% are obese so in other words they dread the very thing
[03:12:15.680 --> 03:12:20.200]  they are just as much as going into debt that's that's pretty hardcore gaining
[03:12:20.200 --> 03:12:24.080]  five pounds is just as bad as going into debt right the New England Journal of
[03:12:24.080 --> 03:12:28.160]  Medicine says the average person gains at least one pound each year between
[03:12:28.160 --> 03:12:33.840]  Thanksgiving and New Year's and usually up to five pounds I know everybody's
[03:12:33.840 --> 03:12:40.280]  interested out in not being able to gain those that weight and when you look at
[03:12:40.280 --> 03:12:44.520]  the Thanksgiving the Christmas holidays really it starts around Halloween when
[03:12:44.520 --> 03:12:48.480]  you get all the candy and you start slowing down because winter time starts
[03:12:48.480 --> 03:12:52.080]  coming in and it's fun though too like I definitely don't think what we're
[03:12:52.080 --> 03:12:55.680]  saying is oh you can't enjoy yourself you can't have these things instead it's
[03:12:55.680 --> 03:13:00.400]  just these little secret kind of attacks these incognito health threats that we
[03:13:00.400 --> 03:13:04.020]  don't realize that are in all this stuff that we can easily get rid of and you
[03:13:04.020 --> 03:13:06.840]  can still enjoy yourself still have fun which I'm all about you know enjoying
[03:13:06.840 --> 03:13:10.560]  yourself in the holidays but not destroying your body not gaining five
[03:13:10.560 --> 03:13:14.240]  to ten pounds and saying oh god why did I do that it's not actually that hard
[03:13:14.240 --> 03:13:17.720]  yeah cuz come January when you have your New Year's resolution you'd be like wow
[03:13:17.720 --> 03:13:22.520]  I actually lost two pounds over the holidays right so what I looked at was
[03:13:22.520 --> 03:13:26.280]  you know what are the most common toxic substances that people are going to be
[03:13:26.280 --> 03:13:31.160]  exposed to over the holidays number one is beverages and that's going to be
[03:13:31.160 --> 03:13:37.240]  your coffee mixes your eggnog your out different alcoholic drinks different
[03:13:37.240 --> 03:13:44.320]  types of cocktails soda eggnog for example now personally I don't drink
[03:13:44.320 --> 03:13:48.960]  eggnog I used to as a kid I liked it and sometimes I'll buy like the coconut
[03:13:48.960 --> 03:13:53.440]  eggnog for the kids or whatever but I was amazed to find out that traditional
[03:13:53.440 --> 03:14:00.800]  eggnog is basically cream sugar white sugar and eggs and one 16 ounce serving
[03:14:00.800 --> 03:14:09.920]  of eggnog contains 500 to 800 calories and 40 grams of fat one 16 ounce serving
[03:14:09.920 --> 03:14:14.800]  that's without any alcohol added and that's the equivalent of you eating
[03:14:14.800 --> 03:14:20.360]  four glazed donuts and I don't know about you guys but I picture everyone
[03:14:20.360 --> 03:14:24.200]  drinking about five of those 16 ounce glasses of eggnog everyone just chugs
[03:14:24.200 --> 03:14:28.400]  it all day with a brandy and wake up in the morning let's have some eggnog you
[03:14:28.400 --> 03:14:30.920]  know and put a little brandy in there and just drink it throughout the day is
[03:14:30.920 --> 03:14:35.400]  pretty much the football game coming on the food starting to come out you're
[03:14:35.400 --> 03:14:39.320]  starting to get your eggnog you're you're adding the brandy in there yeah
[03:14:39.320 --> 03:14:44.280]  it's pretty bad so I tell you a natural replacement for eggnog is if you go to
[03:14:44.280 --> 03:14:49.400]  your natural or organic food store and you can get it's still high in sugar but
[03:14:49.400 --> 03:14:54.040]  it's still going to be better for you coconut eggnog almond milk eggnog they
[03:14:54.040 --> 03:14:57.800]  make it in like a chocolate mint and they make it in in different flavors or
[03:14:57.800 --> 03:15:03.560]  better than that just don't even drink the eggnog and just utilize water which
[03:15:03.560 --> 03:15:09.240]  is another thing that people get dehydrated over the holiday season with
[03:15:09.240 --> 03:15:13.000]  all the alcohol and all these sugary drinks to dehydrate you so one of my
[03:15:13.000 --> 03:15:18.360]  recommendations to over the holidays just make a conscious effort to try to
[03:15:18.360 --> 03:15:25.920]  drink more water you know just get one of the glass water containers and fill
[03:15:25.920 --> 03:15:30.160]  it up and just tell yourself you're gonna drink two or three of those a day the
[03:15:30.160 --> 03:15:36.600]  next thing I have on the list is the sugary drinks and sugar in general for
[03:15:36.600 --> 03:15:41.680]  example a 16 ounce peppermint white chocolate mocha from Starbucks contains
[03:15:41.680 --> 03:15:48.360]  syrups whipped cream and chocolate that adds up to 500 calories and 76 grams of
[03:15:48.360 --> 03:15:51.440]  sugar if you just get rid of the drinks that you're having on a daily basis and
[03:15:51.440 --> 03:15:55.480]  replace it with water or just something that's not complete junk you'll realize
[03:15:55.480 --> 03:16:01.080]  that is about I'd say 70% of people don't realize all of the toxic matter
[03:16:01.080 --> 03:16:03.840]  they're taking in and the extra calories and they're getting fat is because of
[03:16:03.840 --> 03:16:06.640]  the drinks yeah because I was I was looking at all these things and I was
[03:16:06.640 --> 03:16:10.080]  just amazed because I know I mean I have family members and I have people in my
[03:16:10.080 --> 03:16:13.720]  office unfortunately that you know really get into the Christmas spirit and
[03:16:13.720 --> 03:16:19.640]  they you know they're coming in with their venti mocha peppermint mocha lattes
[03:16:19.640 --> 03:16:24.160]  and stuff and which have more calories than a cheeseburger believe it or not
[03:16:24.160 --> 03:16:28.360]  mega doses of sugar and milk and you know there's sweeteners and stuff if you
[03:16:28.360 --> 03:16:33.240]  get one of those vanilla mocha frappuccinos or whatever it is it's
[03:16:33.240 --> 03:16:37.120]  oftentimes like 2,000 calories is like sitting down eating an entire entree at
[03:16:37.120 --> 03:16:40.320]  a restaurant and people just drink it all day because you don't see the label
[03:16:40.320 --> 03:16:44.360]  you don't actually care and you know I want you to keep going and also reminds
[03:16:44.360 --> 03:16:47.640]  me of this though Putin wants Russia to become world's biggest exporter of non
[03:16:47.640 --> 03:16:51.160]  GMO food but that's not even the most important part but most people that are
[03:16:51.160 --> 03:16:56.000]  covering this haven't realized is perhaps the biggest part is Putin says in
[03:16:56.000 --> 03:17:01.240]  this statement the same one that the Western food supply is basically crap
[03:17:01.240 --> 03:17:05.680]  he says we are not only able to feed ourselves taking into account our lands
[03:17:05.680 --> 03:17:09.960]  water resources Russia is able to become the largest world supplier of healthy
[03:17:09.960 --> 03:17:14.400]  ecologically clean and high-quality food is the important part which the Western
[03:17:14.400 --> 03:17:18.880]  producers have long lost especially given the fact that demand for such
[03:17:18.880 --> 03:17:22.760]  products in the world market is steadily going so he says they have clean
[03:17:22.760 --> 03:17:26.680]  food they have ecologically clean food they have real organic food and high
[03:17:26.680 --> 03:17:31.320]  quality food which the Western producers have long lost so isn't it
[03:17:31.320 --> 03:17:36.120]  interesting that a world leader Putin who many would say should really be Time
[03:17:36.120 --> 03:17:40.320]  Magazine man of the year in some ways because of many different fronts because
[03:17:40.320 --> 03:17:44.960]  of his massive publicity and he's kind of outshined Obama in many ways is saying
[03:17:44.960 --> 03:17:50.280]  that the Western food supply is essentially dead dead of devoid of any
[03:17:50.280 --> 03:17:54.680]  high-quality ecologically clean and healthy food devoid of any good organic
[03:17:54.680 --> 03:17:59.520]  food and he says that Russia is going to step up and become the number one
[03:17:59.520 --> 03:18:04.640]  exporter of non-gmo organic food this is from RT Russia today that is his
[03:18:04.640 --> 03:18:09.640]  pivotal point in saying the Western food supply is so dead that he's gonna step
[03:18:09.640 --> 03:18:14.120]  up and take it over is that not a huge attack and a glaring reality that our
[03:18:14.120 --> 03:18:20.000]  food supply is so destroyed that Putin from Russia is going to come in and say
[03:18:20.000 --> 03:18:25.080]  that the US has lost it and he's going to have a main point of his entire
[03:18:25.080 --> 03:18:29.920]  really career seems like be the fact that they have real food again is that
[03:18:29.920 --> 03:18:33.480]  not a final testament of everything we're saying is true all those yeah so
[03:18:33.480 --> 03:18:36.840]  called people saying oh well it's actually fine the research has been clear
[03:18:36.840 --> 03:18:41.120]  everything is fine I mean come on so a foreign a foreign leader has to come in
[03:18:41.120 --> 03:18:46.400]  and retake our food supply for us listen you know a bunch of people are
[03:18:46.400 --> 03:18:50.840]  sweating bullets right now throughout Monsanto and throughout our government
[03:18:50.840 --> 03:18:56.800]  and throughout the USDA and the FDA I mean listen we should have done that a
[03:18:56.800 --> 03:18:59.920]  long time ago we should have never allowed all these chemicals and
[03:18:59.920 --> 03:19:03.960]  genetically modified foods I mean it's great that one country stepping up it's
[03:19:03.960 --> 03:19:06.800]  great that most of the other countries around the world it's horrible
[03:19:06.800 --> 03:19:10.000]  Russia has to come in and tell us that our food supply is dead we should know
[03:19:10.000 --> 03:19:15.760]  that we should be taking steps but it just shows the dead just not even in
[03:19:15.760 --> 03:19:20.960]  competency but the unwillingness to act on the US politician side as the
[03:19:20.960 --> 03:19:23.680]  corporations just loot and pillage everything I mean everything you're
[03:19:23.680 --> 03:19:27.480]  reading on there is not because people are stupid how dare you not know that
[03:19:27.480 --> 03:19:29.960]  you're getting that in your eggnog you know we don't know these things a lot
[03:19:29.960 --> 03:19:33.160]  of us just go out and they have fun and they order whatever's on the menu they're
[03:19:33.160 --> 03:19:36.400]  not always requesting the exact calorie counts is these corporations that are
[03:19:36.400 --> 03:19:39.800]  pushing it on us making it sound healthy and destroying our health we're gonna
[03:19:39.800 --> 03:19:44.480]  talk about how we can avoid the rest of these holiday traps some more news about
[03:19:44.480 --> 03:19:48.040]  whether or not Trump is gonna be banned from the UK and much more we'll be right

[03:23:09.360 --> 03:23:12.560]  typically do the same thing we start with food storage then we address the
[03:23:12.560 --> 03:23:16.800]  need for water but have you considered heat storage I'm talking about staying

[03:24:26.240 --> 03:24:31.640]  want everyone that calls to also answer me this today Time Magazine named German
[03:24:31.640 --> 03:24:37.640]  Chancellor Angela Merkel the person of the year now to give you a little bit of a
[03:24:37.640 --> 03:24:43.640]  time on I printed out the previous years chosen chosen people 2014 were the
[03:24:43.640 --> 03:24:47.080]  Ebola fighters the medical professionals who battled the disease in Africa and
[03:24:47.080 --> 03:24:51.480]  elsewhere or quote tireless acts of courage and mercy for buying the world
[03:24:51.480 --> 03:24:58.120]  time to boost its defenses 2013 was Pope Francis for the first non-European
[03:24:58.120 --> 03:25:03.720]  Pope in 1200 years poised to transform a place that measures change by the
[03:25:03.720 --> 03:25:10.600]  century 2012 was President Obama and 2011 was the protesters era of spring and
[03:25:10.600 --> 03:25:16.720]  2010 was Mark Zuckerberg and again this year is Angela Merkel I want to hear
[03:25:16.720 --> 03:25:21.320]  your take on who you would choose if you had the ability as the person of the
[03:25:21.320 --> 03:25:24.280]  year I also want your health questions for Dr. Group and then I'll tell you who
[03:25:24.280 --> 03:25:28.360]  I would choose who Alex would choose and Dr. Group can tell you who he would
[03:25:28.360 --> 03:25:32.200]  choose as well before we get into more with Dr. Group I also want to talk about
[03:25:32.200 --> 03:25:38.440]  this story petition to ban Trump from UK passes 250,000 signatures and could be
[03:25:38.440 --> 03:25:44.160]  debated in Parliament this is from CNN a petition calling for Donald Trump to be
[03:25:44.160 --> 03:25:47.400]  banned from entering the UK has attracted more than a quarter of a
[03:25:47.400 --> 03:25:51.200]  million signatures more than enough for a committee to consider sending the
[03:25:51.200 --> 03:25:55.240]  motion for parliamentary debate the petition to block the front-running
[03:25:55.240 --> 03:25:58.760]  Republican presidential candidate from entering the country was created on the
[03:25:58.760 --> 03:26:02.760]  British government's official petitions website and response to Trump's call
[03:26:02.760 --> 03:26:08.880]  Monday to ban Muslims from entering the country without until Obama did
[03:26:08.880 --> 03:26:12.000]  something about it of course it was misquoted over and over again in the
[03:26:12.000 --> 03:26:16.800]  media now if this is anything like the White House dot gov petitions where if
[03:26:16.800 --> 03:26:20.120]  you get like a hundred fifty thousand or whatever it is they have to review it
[03:26:20.120 --> 03:26:25.360]  it's pretty much a joke and in that we've actually I've done some I know Alex
[03:26:25.360 --> 03:26:28.600]  had a number of successful petitions that hit the limit like a band Pierce
[03:26:28.600 --> 03:26:32.160]  Morgan or whatever it was but they usually just respond with all we looked
[03:26:32.160 --> 03:26:34.800]  at it nothing's gonna happen so we'll see what happens with this but could you
[03:26:34.800 --> 03:26:39.400]  imagine if they actually banned Donald Trump from the UK and then can you
[03:26:39.400 --> 03:26:44.880]  imagine if he actually became president and he was still banned from the UK so as
[03:26:44.880 --> 03:26:49.480]  the call come all calls come in I want to have Dr. Group just go through a few
[03:26:49.480 --> 03:26:53.560]  more ways that you can really avoid the weight gain the toxic intake during the
[03:26:53.560 --> 03:26:56.840]  holidays and just whenever really in your life some of the most important
[03:26:56.840 --> 03:27:00.480]  secrets and we're gonna go to your calls and cover some more news some uplifting
[03:27:00.480 --> 03:27:04.680]  news some quantum mechanic news on Google's new supercomputer that can do
[03:27:04.680 --> 03:27:10.200]  math is a lot of interesting stuff but Dr. Group well I'm looking forward to
[03:27:10.200 --> 03:27:13.920]  taking some calls but another thing that came up with that I wanted to let
[03:27:13.920 --> 03:27:17.920]  people know about is alcohol consumption over the holidays if you are
[03:27:17.920 --> 03:27:21.480]  going to be consuming most people consume two to three times the amount of
[03:27:21.480 --> 03:27:25.680]  alcohol there's a lot of hangovers during the holidays and a lot of people
[03:27:25.680 --> 03:27:30.760]  reach for the Tylenol the acetaminophen it's been shown that that can cause
[03:27:30.760 --> 03:27:35.560]  permanent liver damage so I just wanted everybody to be aware that first of all
[03:27:35.560 --> 03:27:39.880]  they should reduce their alcohol content if they can't do that they should
[03:27:39.880 --> 03:27:45.720]  drink more water but if you do have headaches be very careful taking acetaminophen
[03:27:45.720 --> 03:27:51.640]  with alcohol I gotta tell you acetaminophen is is is bad it is
[03:27:51.640 --> 03:27:55.960]  I mean I don't even know why you eat they die from it deliver failure the liver
[03:27:55.960 --> 03:28:00.080]  goes in yeah it's it's so for the record and not making any claims against
[03:28:00.080 --> 03:28:03.440]  certain brands but the brands that have a acetaminophen oftentimes even at small
[03:28:03.440 --> 03:28:08.000]  doses there's been deaths acetaminophen is extremely hepatoxic
[03:28:08.000 --> 03:28:11.280]  toxic to the liver and then what people don't realize is they're drinking and
[03:28:11.280 --> 03:28:13.960]  I've seen people do this I have to stop them from doing it they'll be out
[03:28:13.960 --> 03:28:17.960]  drinking the night before and they'll say oh well just pop this you know pill a
[03:28:17.960 --> 03:28:22.440]  brand-name pill with acetaminophen in it and I'll be fine no no no if you are
[03:28:22.440 --> 03:28:26.120]  taking it with alcohol you're damaging your liver and then if you wake up and
[03:28:26.120 --> 03:28:28.600]  you're still drunk or you have a hangover or whatever you're damaging it
[03:28:28.600 --> 03:28:31.560]  still it cannot be taken without called all so many people actually die from that
[03:28:31.560 --> 03:28:36.640]  you have here's the thing if you if you don't change your diet at all and you
[03:28:36.640 --> 03:28:41.080]  continue doing every single thing you normally do during the holiday season
[03:28:41.080 --> 03:28:47.520]  then at least take some x2 iodine which is going to help you detoxify take some
[03:28:47.520 --> 03:28:51.720]  deep cleanse take some oxy powder and just supplement I mean right there alone
[03:28:51.720 --> 03:28:54.960]  you're going to be taking care of the majority of the problems and drinking
[03:28:54.960 --> 03:29:01.640]  more water and reducing your stress levels over the holidays that's that's
[03:29:01.640 --> 03:29:07.680]  many many solutions that people can put into place and the other great solution
[03:29:07.680 --> 03:29:12.560]  is just eat organic food and don't buy all the boxed and canned ingredients for
[03:29:12.560 --> 03:29:18.280]  Christmas look at stuffing for example I mean if you read the ingredients on a
[03:29:18.280 --> 03:29:23.400]  stuffing box from the store it's this long the gravies all contain MSG all the
[03:29:23.400 --> 03:29:28.920]  the powdered gravies that you mix have MSG in them just go back to the old school
[03:29:28.920 --> 03:29:32.840]  way of doing things and eat healthy and cook your own Christmas dinner with
[03:29:32.840 --> 03:29:36.600]  organic ingredients and it's cheaper to people always say well I can't afford
[03:29:36.600 --> 03:29:39.800]  organic well if you buy the actual raw materials it's much easier we'll be back
[03:29:39.800 --> 03:29:43.040]  with your calls and more news is the Alex Jones show I'm Anthony Goodsharty on

[03:29:54.040 --> 03:29:56.520]  network
[03:29:58.120 --> 03:30:01.680]  remember when we were told they hate us for our freedoms maybe it's the
[03:30:01.680 --> 03:30:05.840]  politicians who hate us for our freedoms when Donald Trump said suspend all
[03:30:05.840 --> 03:30:10.880]  Muslim immigration until we can identify the internet exploded Obama's attorney
[03:30:10.880 --> 03:30:15.000]  general Loretta Lynch told Muslims her greatest fear was not Muslim violence
[03:30:15.000 --> 03:30:19.680]  but anti-Muslim rhetoric that violent talk is not American and will be
[03:30:19.680 --> 03:30:24.200]  prosecuted is that religious freedom or Islam they want to protect they ignored
[03:30:24.200 --> 03:30:27.960]  it when Trump attacked the First Amendment in the same speech maybe in
[03:30:27.960 --> 03:30:32.120]  certain areas closing that internet up in some way somebody will say all
[03:30:32.120 --> 03:30:36.240]  freedom of speech freedom of speech these are foolish people what is foolish
[03:30:36.240 --> 03:30:40.240]  is to surrender our liberty to politicians of any strike so we have
[03:30:40.240 --> 03:30:44.800]  politicians and the press beating the drum daily telling you to surrender your

[03:34:54.360 --> 03:34:58.360]  quality group makes them for a reason because they work let's go to some calls
[03:34:58.360 --> 03:35:07.000]  let's jump right in to David in New Hampshire what's up David hey guys I
[03:35:07.000 --> 03:35:12.400]  was just calling in because I had heard earlier Alex talking a lot about what's
[03:35:12.400 --> 03:35:15.920]  going on with the politics but now you guys are talking about the holidays you're
[03:35:15.920 --> 03:35:19.200]  talking about the stresses and the food and the sugar and everything that people
[03:35:19.200 --> 03:35:22.560]  eat in the holidays but this point ties in with that and it ties with the fact
[03:35:22.560 --> 03:35:29.840]  that people have a an electrical bio bio electrical body well our bodies are
[03:35:29.840 --> 03:35:35.720]  are based off of the electricity and the energy that goes through them and
[03:35:35.720 --> 03:35:43.120]  people are kept on a level of fear based and emotional based and sexual based
[03:35:43.120 --> 03:35:48.080]  ideas and the reason why we like to eat so much during the holidays is because
[03:35:48.080 --> 03:35:51.120]  it's an emotional thing eating is an emotional thing anybody who's done a
[03:35:51.120 --> 03:35:56.520]  cleanse knows that eating becomes a very a very emotional thing and when you
[03:35:56.520 --> 03:36:01.720]  don't eat with everybody else you realize how much you you become
[03:36:01.720 --> 03:36:05.680]  codependent in relationships another thing so I bring this point out to say
[03:36:05.680 --> 03:36:10.840]  that until we as a people as a society can grab a hold of our emotions
[03:36:10.840 --> 03:36:16.280]  understand who we are a sexual being and also as emotional beings and spiritual
[03:36:16.280 --> 03:36:19.920]  beings what will continue the same pattern it doesn't matter if you if you
[03:36:19.920 --> 03:36:24.800]  alarm someone to the dangers of you know fluoride or the dangers of corn syrup
[03:36:24.800 --> 03:36:28.240]  it's like until they understand themselves as a spiritual entity as
[03:36:28.240 --> 03:36:32.800]  something that can function a hundred percent completely healthily you know
[03:36:32.800 --> 03:36:37.600]  you're gonna have these issues but yeah that was beautifully said and I
[03:36:37.600 --> 03:36:41.600]  would agree with a lot of that and in fact I agree with all of it and except
[03:36:41.600 --> 03:36:44.560]  for the part that you can't warn people and you can't wake them up because I'm
[03:36:44.560 --> 03:36:48.800]  here to tell you that you really can and there is obviously a really really deep
[03:36:48.800 --> 03:36:53.560]  core thing that we also realize that sure we are we're human beings we have a
[03:36:53.560 --> 03:36:56.800]  power we have a you know human spirit whatever you want to call it we have
[03:36:56.800 --> 03:37:00.800]  consciousness whatever you want to believe and obviously a lot of the things
[03:37:00.800 --> 03:37:05.680]  that we do are because we're in a charged emotional fight or flight state or in a
[03:37:05.680 --> 03:37:09.200]  fear-based state from watching the mainstream media I call it feeding your
[03:37:09.200 --> 03:37:13.280]  brain cheese whiz right you wouldn't eat cheese whiz every day so why do we
[03:37:13.280 --> 03:37:16.880]  treat our content consumption so much differently than our food consumption I
[03:37:16.880 --> 03:37:20.400]  wouldn't sit here and eat lace potato chips or whatever type of potato chips
[03:37:20.400 --> 03:37:24.240]  Doritos whatever for every day for 12 hours just like I wouldn't watch the
[03:37:24.240 --> 03:37:27.840]  mainstream media or American Idol every single day for 12 hours I wouldn't
[03:37:27.840 --> 03:37:31.640]  personally but some people do and when they have that content stream coming in
[03:37:31.640 --> 03:37:36.560]  their brain feeding their brain junk the cheese whiz of content they get into a
[03:37:36.560 --> 03:37:40.280]  poor state they hear only about the terrorism and the fights and Obama coming
[03:37:40.280 --> 03:37:44.000]  on television saying ISIS is going to get you if you don't turn in your guns
[03:37:44.000 --> 03:37:49.720]  we fight back with the counter information and I try to get a positive
[03:37:49.720 --> 03:37:53.760]  solution-based thing and Alex does too constantly all the time and fighting
[03:37:53.760 --> 03:37:58.120]  back against all of that and it can get tiresome it can feel like a lot it can
[03:37:58.120 --> 03:38:00.800]  make you want to give up sometimes but the truth is you have to keep going on
[03:38:00.800 --> 03:38:05.480]  and that's what you're saying and I agree with you right but I also say give
[03:38:05.480 --> 03:38:08.720]  people some more chance than that right because we're waking them up about this
[03:38:08.720 --> 03:38:11.920]  they might learn about the fluoride they might learn about any of this stuff and
[03:38:11.920 --> 03:38:15.160]  then say wow I really want to learn more and make a change and how many people
[03:38:15.160 --> 03:38:19.040]  have I seen that happen to including myself right because I was never just
[03:38:19.040 --> 03:38:23.480]  a magically awake magic magically conscious I knew all this stuff it was I
[03:38:23.480 --> 03:38:27.600]  know I was a standard quote-unquote normal person that would eat drink my egg
[03:38:27.600 --> 03:38:30.960]  naga whatever you want to call it you know without knowing what I was doing so
[03:38:30.960 --> 03:38:34.760]  I I believe in everyone I believe in their ability to rise up 100% but what
[03:38:34.760 --> 03:38:38.960]  you said was beautiful and I want to get Dr. Groups take on this but I have one
[03:38:38.960 --> 03:38:43.720]  final question who is your time person of the year if you could choose one
[03:38:43.720 --> 03:38:50.560]  David of the year time person of the year it's only two people come up from
[03:38:50.560 --> 03:38:56.920]  head right now Donald Trump or the proof and it's just because you have two of
[03:38:56.920 --> 03:39:01.320]  these people who understand what's going on in the world to a certain extent and
[03:39:01.320 --> 03:39:06.400]  the Trump I have fears of a greater military expansion and the same thing
[03:39:06.400 --> 03:39:10.360]  but at least they understand that David thank you right on right on and I
[03:39:10.360 --> 03:39:14.200]  apologize cutting you off but the the music of the children in the back was
[03:39:14.200 --> 03:39:17.280]  it was very beautiful but I'm not you know some listeners might not enjoy it
[03:39:17.280 --> 03:39:20.320]  as much but Dr. Group tell me your take on that and by the way those are two
[03:39:20.320 --> 03:39:23.840]  great choices I mean I mean you just have to look at it now I mean I know
[03:39:23.840 --> 03:39:28.000]  David knows what he's what he's talking about and that is the main goal I mean
[03:39:28.000 --> 03:39:32.280]  the main goal is to is to change the world and help as many people as we
[03:39:32.280 --> 03:39:38.080]  can and bring back the consciousness and let people know who they are really
[03:39:38.080 --> 03:39:44.400]  inside and I can tell you that by cleansing the body looking at what
[03:39:44.400 --> 03:39:48.240]  causes fear because again it's all about what is the root cause of our problem
[03:39:48.240 --> 03:39:52.640]  here what causes fear what causes depression what causes all these things
[03:39:52.640 --> 03:39:59.280]  that create the desire for addiction food is the is more addictive than drugs
[03:39:59.280 --> 03:40:03.560]  people don't even realize that alcohol kills more people food kills more people
[03:40:03.560 --> 03:40:10.320]  than drugs do gluten and wheat contain opiates they're addictive that's why
[03:40:10.320 --> 03:40:14.800]  people get addicted to bread and addicted to foods it makes you feel good
[03:40:14.800 --> 03:40:22.400]  sugar makes you feel good exactly so but I can tell you after evaluating
[03:40:22.400 --> 03:40:26.720]  hundreds of thousands of people that have gone through cleansing that the
[03:40:26.720 --> 03:40:32.000]  positive thing the positive outlook that people have you changed your life when
[03:40:32.000 --> 03:40:36.720]  you were suffering with disease and you found natural medicine I grew up on TV
[03:40:36.720 --> 03:40:42.000]  dinners and you know Coca-Cola and the worst food and diets that you could
[03:40:42.000 --> 03:40:48.560]  imagine I'd acne all over my face and I changed my life you changed your life
[03:40:48.560 --> 03:40:53.880]  people every single day are changing their life even if they're doing it one
[03:40:53.880 --> 03:40:58.640]  step at a time if there's a if there's a massive staircase that goes all the way
[03:40:58.640 --> 03:41:02.920]  down to cancer and disease and goes all the way up to perfect health you don't
[03:41:02.920 --> 03:41:08.200]  have to take and jump a hundred steps at a time it's about a daily change as a
[03:41:08.200 --> 03:41:12.560]  matter of fact that's what I recommend next time you need to buy salt for your
[03:41:12.560 --> 03:41:16.920]  home don't buy table salt buy Himalayan crystal salt next time you need to buy
[03:41:16.920 --> 03:41:22.800]  deodorant don't buy aluminum based deodorant buy natural deodorant yes it's
[03:41:22.800 --> 03:41:26.400]  in most of the cases it's not as good you might have to apply it two times a
[03:41:26.400 --> 03:41:30.960]  day but you're making baby steps you're making changes and you're educating
[03:41:30.960 --> 03:41:35.160]  yourself and you're doing what your body wants you to do and believe it or not
[03:41:35.160 --> 03:41:40.720]  you will become more conscious that way when you detoxify the body look at what
[03:41:40.720 --> 03:41:46.760]  causes depression and addiction fluoride causes a calcification of your pine
[03:41:46.760 --> 03:41:52.240]  neal gland it causes depressive like symptoms it causes non aggressiveness
[03:41:52.240 --> 03:41:59.040]  you when you look at BPA fluoride mercury cadmium aluminum lead all the
[03:41:59.040 --> 03:42:03.760]  phthalates the BPAs all of these different types of chemicals yes they
[03:42:03.760 --> 03:42:09.800]  do affect your brain they make you to the point where you are unhappy and
[03:42:09.800 --> 03:42:14.240]  that's why the psyche psychological industry is so profitable and that's
[03:42:14.240 --> 03:42:17.440]  why the pharmaceutical companies are focusing the majority of their
[03:42:17.440 --> 03:42:22.880]  marketing dollars on anxiety depression and stress and everything else because
[03:42:22.880 --> 03:42:29.000]  there's no clinical testing needed to prescribe these medications even though
[03:42:29.000 --> 03:42:32.320]  for years we've been telling you it's all in the gut I mean you've said it for
[03:42:32.320 --> 03:42:35.160]  20 plus years I'm just a little mimicker really but I'm reading the
[03:42:35.160 --> 03:42:37.880]  studies and I found out for myself independently and realized you're saying
[03:42:37.880 --> 03:42:43.360]  the same thing but geez the studies proving that mental illness starts in
[03:42:43.360 --> 03:42:48.200]  a gut and a lot of people also say well I'll also prove that you're real
[03:42:48.200 --> 03:42:50.400]  consciousness your real intellectual expansion whatever you want to call it
[03:42:50.400 --> 03:42:54.600]  has a biological aspect because most people that feel anxiety and depression
[03:42:54.600 --> 03:42:58.720]  they don't even realize that could be a biological factor as opposed you know a
[03:42:58.720 --> 03:43:02.800]  physical health gut factor as opposed to a mental factor and a lot of it is a
[03:43:02.800 --> 03:43:07.120]  gut imbalance so it's like an your body can either help you or can be an anchor
[03:43:07.120 --> 03:43:10.440]  pulling you down and when people's bodies aren't in alignment they're totally
[03:43:10.440 --> 03:43:14.040]  jacked up and thanks to these corporations that don't care by the way the
[03:43:14.040 --> 03:43:17.760]  true culprits of all this when they're totally just bloated and feeling like
[03:43:17.760 --> 03:43:21.080]  crap how are they supposed to be sitting there having an intellectual
[03:43:21.080 --> 03:43:25.000]  revolution it's just not going to happen the gut is contaminated and
[03:43:25.000 --> 03:43:29.240]  destroyed it's leading to mental illness it's leading to memory loss it's just
[03:43:29.240 --> 03:43:32.920]  all these horrible things so overall I 100% agree it starts really with the
[03:43:32.920 --> 03:43:36.280]  body and cleansing which is what we're all talking about let's go to Jim he
[03:43:36.280 --> 03:43:40.560]  wants to talk about cleansing Jim in Florida what's on your mind
[03:43:41.840 --> 03:43:47.720]  hey Jim can you hear us your phone working all right Jim thank you for your
[03:43:47.720 --> 03:43:52.800]  call unfortunately your phone is not working right now let's talk to Stefan
[03:43:52.800 --> 03:43:56.200]  I believe in Washington wants to talk about bloating and feeling out of it
[03:43:56.200 --> 03:44:02.560]  and possibly cleansing as well what's on your mind yeah hi there yeah so I'm
[03:44:02.560 --> 03:44:07.720]  normal weight everywhere except on my stomach especially in the evening I'm
[03:44:07.720 --> 03:44:15.480]  like a pregnant woman walking around so what what do you have well do you
[03:44:15.480 --> 03:44:22.960]  consume alcohol no okay so if you don't drink then normally if you have some
[03:44:22.960 --> 03:44:29.120]  bloating in the afternoon for men if you have that extra weight around your
[03:44:29.120 --> 03:44:33.920]  waist most likely your liver is congested that's there's a there's a few
[03:44:33.920 --> 03:44:37.440]  different things so we'll talk about each your liver is congested and you need
[03:44:37.440 --> 03:44:42.240]  to to do a liver cleanse maybe one two or three liver cleanses because that
[03:44:42.240 --> 03:44:48.440]  means your liver is not processing and metabolizing the fats effectively and
[03:44:48.440 --> 03:44:52.840]  without getting into your whole dietary habits and everything else iodine
[03:44:52.840 --> 03:44:58.520]  deficiency is another cause of weight gain around the waist in males it could
[03:44:58.520 --> 03:45:03.840]  also be associated with a B12 deficiency of item in D deficiency but with
[03:45:03.840 --> 03:45:07.560]  continued cleansing going back to what Anthony said the gut how important the
[03:45:07.560 --> 03:45:14.120]  gut is it's amazing how many symptoms mysteriously disappear not mysteriously
[03:45:14.120 --> 03:45:19.640]  but because the body actually has the necessary tools to heal itself when you
[03:45:19.640 --> 03:45:25.040]  fix the gut the gut is the bio dome it's like the soil of the earth you know
[03:45:25.040 --> 03:45:29.920]  when you in soil you have microorganisms right that caused the plant to grow and
[03:45:29.920 --> 03:45:34.400]  thrive in the gut you have microorganisms a lot of them actually are
[03:45:34.400 --> 03:45:39.200]  soil-based microorganisms that live in your gut what those organisms do we
[03:45:39.200 --> 03:45:44.040]  call them probiotics and prebiotics are what probiotics eat the prebiotics are
[03:45:44.040 --> 03:45:49.520]  different types of foods and inulin and and oligosaccharides that the probiotics
[03:45:49.520 --> 03:45:55.960]  feed on when you have the proper balance of probiotics in your gut that will
[03:45:55.960 --> 03:46:01.760]  reduce some of the gas reduce some of the bloating believe it or not your
[03:46:01.760 --> 03:46:06.720]  neurotransmitters are produced in your gut that keep you happy it's serotonin
[03:46:06.720 --> 03:46:12.280]  melatonin things like that so the first step that I always take with anybody
[03:46:12.280 --> 03:46:17.480]  regardless of what condition they're suffering from is to clean and repair the
[03:46:17.480 --> 03:46:22.200]  gut you know clean it out really good with the oxypowder use a good probiotic
[03:46:22.200 --> 03:46:26.960]  formula repair all that of course slowly change their diet at the same time but
[03:46:26.960 --> 03:46:33.120]  thyroid issues really can can cause excessive weight gain in different
[03:46:33.120 --> 03:46:38.720]  areas of the body and men usually around the waist so I would definitely look at
[03:46:38.720 --> 03:46:43.520]  possibly supplementing with an iodine supplement such as X2 and of course none
[03:46:43.520 --> 03:46:47.640]  of this is medical advice yeah I'll also say that you should be thankful you're
[03:46:47.640 --> 03:46:51.080]  getting these signs and symptoms because I used to have that a long time ago and
[03:46:51.080 --> 03:46:54.240]  then I started really feeling more depressed and feeling more anxiety and
[03:46:54.240 --> 03:46:57.400]  feeling like crap and the bloating wasn't there as much this is the beginning
[03:46:57.400 --> 03:47:01.560]  in my view again not medical advice of something that you can start potentially
[03:47:01.560 --> 03:47:05.960]  fixing thank you so much for your call we're gonna go to Steven in Florida he
[03:47:05.960 --> 03:47:08.680]  wants to talk about digestion and he wants to talk about person of the year
[03:47:08.680 --> 03:47:13.360]  and I want to add finish up this call and get into who we choose as person of
[03:47:13.360 --> 03:47:17.680]  the year and talk about some of that as well so Steven first of all who is your
[03:47:17.680 --> 03:47:24.200]  person of the year yeah good afternoon well I've got at East versus West I've
[03:47:24.200 --> 03:47:30.200]  really got to if it was a matter of East I would have to nominate Vladimir
[03:47:30.200 --> 03:47:34.320]  Putin because this man like Alex Jones says is really taking the moral high
[03:47:34.320 --> 03:47:39.160]  ground he stepped up he sent multiple messages to the globalist that he's not
[03:47:39.160 --> 03:47:44.080]  gonna let them run him with his attacks on ISIS is you know what I have
[03:47:44.080 --> 03:47:47.320]  considered not to sword rattling he'll make good what he's saying with his
[03:47:47.320 --> 03:47:51.760]  threats and rightly so but also this latest news about what he said
[03:47:51.760 --> 03:47:57.720]  sending a message to the you know the people with the biotech so-called
[03:47:57.720 --> 03:48:03.040]  industry like Monsanto about organics this is a really bombshell information
[03:48:03.040 --> 03:48:08.400]  and I hope that he able to do that on the Western side I would have to nominate
[03:48:08.400 --> 03:48:14.480]  Alex Jones because I think of anybody in America he is really stepped up and I
[03:48:14.480 --> 03:48:19.560]  said he's not a hero but he is a modern-day Paul Revere among the founding
[03:48:19.560 --> 03:48:23.480]  fathers of that ill because that's who I would that's the two that I would
[03:48:23.480 --> 03:48:28.160]  nominate if we I think those are two great choices and you know we talk about
[03:48:28.160 --> 03:48:32.240]  Putin he wants to become an exporter of non GMO food he talks about the Western
[03:48:32.240 --> 03:48:37.600]  food supply dying he constantly just criticizes all the really really good
[03:48:37.600 --> 03:48:40.960]  points that he brings up in the United States obviously is some issues as well
[03:48:40.960 --> 03:48:45.120]  you talk about Alex he's in here every day three hours on the radio show and
[03:48:45.120 --> 03:48:48.920]  what you don't see is the five-plus hours he works every single day off the
[03:48:48.920 --> 03:48:54.160]  air and he's 100% dedicated 100% real and I totally stand behind that choice as
[03:48:54.160 --> 03:48:58.360]  well so actually if you want to ask a question on the just-subject real quick
[03:48:58.360 --> 03:49:02.960]  Stephen go ahead and burst it out yeah I've got a friend that had recently she's
[03:49:02.960 --> 03:49:06.320]  been diagnosed with I think it's celiac disease and she had to go to the
[03:49:06.320 --> 03:49:10.360]  hospital after an attack in her bow she had seven feet of her intestines
[03:49:10.360 --> 03:49:14.880]  removed lost a lot of weight so recovering at home but what I want to
[03:49:14.880 --> 03:49:18.880]  find out is this with the cleansing systems that doctor group that you've
[03:49:18.880 --> 03:49:24.320]  developed like the oxy powder and the liver cleanse etc would those would you
[03:49:24.320 --> 03:49:27.640]  recommend those to someone like that because their doctors are having around
[03:49:27.640 --> 03:49:32.720]  a special basically liquefied diet she can't have anything solid but do you
[03:49:32.720 --> 03:49:37.440]  think that would help her be you know harmful to her in her situation let me
[03:49:37.440 --> 03:49:40.640]  also just jump in and say once again this is not medical advice so we're not
[03:49:40.640 --> 03:49:43.000]  giving medical advice to your friends she should obviously speak to a
[03:49:43.000 --> 03:49:46.400]  qualified health care professional that is able to see her and physically see
[03:49:46.400 --> 03:49:49.600]  I mean doctor groups just sitting here you know listen to a vague example of the
[03:49:49.600 --> 03:49:54.840]  story you know I can't stand the regulations because it's just you
[03:49:54.840 --> 03:49:59.560]  know you can't tell somebody something that you know works a hundred percent of
[03:49:59.560 --> 03:50:03.400]  the time so it's just crazy the regulations they're coming down with and
[03:50:03.400 --> 03:50:07.200]  it's all done by design they're really trying to push out the natural medicine
[03:50:07.200 --> 03:50:12.320]  I mean that's what we had 3,000 years ago okay and now they're just trying you
[03:50:12.320 --> 03:50:16.120]  know there's just attack after attack after attack on stuff that actually
[03:50:16.120 --> 03:50:23.040]  works and gets people better so if I had celiac disease this is what I would do
[03:50:23.040 --> 03:50:27.600]  number one is I would 20 seconds number one is I would cleanse and you know I
[03:50:27.600 --> 03:50:31.800]  would cleanse with oxy powder and I would repair the probiotics in my gut I
[03:50:31.800 --> 03:50:37.400]  would also take the x2 and you know you can feel free to contact my office as
[03:50:37.400 --> 03:50:44.280]  well I do have a support program for celiac disease or repairing the gut or
[03:50:44.280 --> 03:50:48.360]  rebalancing the intestinal tract the medical profession has three options
[03:50:48.360 --> 03:50:52.120]  drug cutter burn I'm sorry to hear that they cut out the intestines because
[03:50:52.120 --> 03:50:55.960]  once again they're not working on fixing the root cause we'll be right back
[03:50:55.960 --> 03:50:59.600]  with the next segment we'll reveal Alex's time person of the year choice my

[03:54:13.080 --> 03:54:17.800]  joined with dr. Edward group and we're talking about who we would choose for
[03:54:17.800 --> 03:54:21.480]  time person of the year and I'm gonna explain Alex's choice as well and dr.
[03:54:21.480 --> 03:54:25.840]  group here is gonna tell you so time magazine in case you didn't hear today
[03:54:25.840 --> 03:54:30.200]  named German Chancellor Angela Merkel as the person of the year previous ones
[03:54:30.200 --> 03:54:35.880]  include the Ebola fighters Pope Francis President Obama the protester for
[03:54:35.880 --> 03:54:40.440]  Arab Spring let himself on fire and Mark Zuckerberg some interesting choices
[03:54:40.440 --> 03:54:43.840]  some I can understand some are quite interesting like Pope Francis and Mark
[03:54:43.840 --> 03:54:49.200]  Zuckerberg and obviously Obama but we took a number of calls and some of the
[03:54:49.200 --> 03:54:54.600]  callers said they chose Putin Trump Alex and I think that was it dr. group who
[03:54:54.600 --> 03:54:57.960]  is your choice for time person of the year if you could magically choose it
[03:54:57.960 --> 03:55:01.920]  well first of all I don't really agree that much with time person of the year
[03:55:01.920 --> 03:55:06.160]  but I would have to since it's not technically a person of the year I
[03:55:06.160 --> 03:55:12.080]  would have to give that award to all of the individual activists that have
[03:55:12.080 --> 03:55:16.720]  posted information on YouTube that have gone out to the March against Monsanto
[03:55:16.720 --> 03:55:23.440]  the rallies all the people out there that are educating everybody else to
[03:55:23.440 --> 03:55:28.080]  against the tyranny that's out there today I mean it's stuff that we work
[03:55:28.080 --> 03:55:32.640]  for every single day and it's you know somebody asked me you know why don't you
[03:55:32.640 --> 03:55:35.800]  get in politics and why don't you be a senator and I said do you know how
[03:55:35.800 --> 03:55:41.200]  change happens okay we wouldn't have the non-gmo verified seal if it wasn't for
[03:55:41.200 --> 03:55:45.680]  the public speaking out in us we in the public refusing to buy things it's the
[03:55:45.680 --> 03:55:51.880]  activism and it's the people that create more change look organic foods look at
[03:55:51.880 --> 03:55:54.880]  all the different changes getting fluoride out of the water all the
[03:55:54.880 --> 03:55:58.920]  activism there all the education all the videos that are going up everywhere all
[03:55:58.920 --> 03:56:02.080]  the newsletters that are going out educating people all the people that
[03:56:02.080 --> 03:56:07.480]  are dedicating their life every single day working eight hours 12 hours a day
[03:56:07.480 --> 03:56:11.080]  to try to change the world make the world a better place to be cleaning up
[03:56:11.080 --> 03:56:15.080]  the air quality cleaning up the water quality educating people and how they
[03:56:15.080 --> 03:56:19.280]  can become healthy and change lives it's all grass roots efforts that's how
[03:56:19.280 --> 03:56:22.560]  change happens it's not going to change in government that's right that's right
[03:56:22.560 --> 03:56:27.640]  that's an amazing choice and so Alex's choice we just briefly question you know
[03:56:27.640 --> 03:56:30.120]  asked him the question before we walked in so he could probably give a better
[03:56:30.120 --> 03:56:33.480]  explanation perhaps on the show but he chose Donald Trump and I totally get it
[03:56:33.480 --> 03:56:37.520]  why not only is Trump standing against political correctness but the mainstream
[03:56:37.520 --> 03:56:43.200]  media hates him and he's standing up against them really as a third party
[03:56:43.200 --> 03:56:47.320]  against the GOP establishment against all establishments he is an anti
[03:56:47.320 --> 03:56:51.440]  establishment self-made man that can pretty much say whatever he stands for
[03:56:51.440 --> 03:56:56.080]  and not have to care and that is really admirable in many ways even if you don't
[03:56:56.080 --> 03:56:59.680]  agree with his politics imagine that someone that can sit there and he he
[03:56:59.680 --> 03:57:03.480]  tweets some some hardcore stuff you know definitely calling people dummies is
[03:57:03.480 --> 03:57:07.600]  not along the line of the mainstream media establishment that lock that locks
[03:57:07.600 --> 03:57:11.160]  everyone into this political correctness for me you know I think that's a great
[03:57:11.160 --> 03:57:14.440]  choice I think yours is an amazing choice as well I would have to say that
[03:57:14.440 --> 03:57:20.880]  Matt Drudge 100% deserves to be time person of the year if not this year
[03:57:20.880 --> 03:57:24.320]  then you know next year because you think about it all these people are doing
[03:57:24.320 --> 03:57:28.040]  amazing things yes Trump you know does some some pretty amazing things standing
[03:57:28.040 --> 03:57:31.040]  up for the right ways even if you don't believe in many of his politics the
[03:57:31.040 --> 03:57:35.400]  activists all this stuff but where does it all go to it goes to the bullhorn of
[03:57:35.400 --> 03:57:39.440]  reality where do you go for news where do you go to see what you know Trump said
[03:57:39.440 --> 03:57:43.080]  or what Putin did or wherever you go you go to Drudge Report every single day
[03:57:43.080 --> 03:57:46.720]  and you sit there and you let it refresh for eight hours while you're at the
[03:57:46.720 --> 03:57:50.520]  workplace or wherever you are and it's kind of a behind-the-scenes thing behind
[03:57:50.520 --> 03:57:53.360]  the scenes thing right there's no photos of Matt Drudge there's no videos he's
[03:57:53.360 --> 03:57:57.480]  behind-the-scenes guy but he's giving it all to you and feeding it in a way that
[03:57:57.480 --> 03:58:02.720]  makes sense and it's a succinct bullhorn of reality so I would choose 100% Matt
[03:58:02.720 --> 03:58:06.760]  Drudge and I salute him for all he has done this is the Alex Jones show Alex
[03:58:06.760 --> 03:58:11.400]  be back live from 11th to tomorrow I'm Anthony Gutiarty Dr. Group thanks so
[03:58:11.400 --> 03:58:38.960]  much for joining us and all have an amazing day we'll see you again tomorrow
