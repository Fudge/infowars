[00:00.000 --> 00:12.160]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.160 --> 00:20.880]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.880 --> 00:30.600]  it is Thursday July 15th 2010 I'm Alex Jones your host for me taking your
[00:30.600 --> 00:34.080]  phone calls throughout the broadcast today and Paul Joseph Watson joins us
[00:34.080 --> 00:42.240]  live via video Skype from England to cover the incredible developments as the
[00:42.240 --> 00:48.680]  private planetary banking cartel pushes the planet into a designed depression
[00:48.680 --> 00:54.160]  and as we go into this tunnel of designed orchestrated collapse they intend
[00:54.160 --> 00:59.880]  for us to come out on the other side absolute debt slaves to these criminals
[00:59.880 --> 01:07.960]  in this sadistic psychopathic ruling class now I have a lot of news here that
[01:07.960 --> 01:12.000]  I want to go over today but I also want to take your phone calls but I want to
[01:12.000 --> 01:19.560]  specifically hear from listeners and get your view and your take on my statements
[01:19.560 --> 01:25.080]  yesterday that the elite are definitely intending to bring us into a deep
[01:25.080 --> 01:29.480]  depression we're already into the beginning stages of it a sliding into
[01:29.480 --> 01:34.040]  it in the last three years now there are literally hundreds of mainstream news
[01:34.040 --> 01:39.640]  headlines in Europe Australia England Canada the United States every day you
[01:39.640 --> 01:44.360]  just type depression in to Google click news hundreds of news stories a day
[01:44.360 --> 01:50.240]  conservatively as the establishment says time to dump the greenback oh you
[01:50.240 --> 01:53.320]  know investors move away from the greenback the greenback needs to only
[01:53.320 --> 01:59.160]  be part of a basket of that backs up a new global currency and the answer of
[01:59.160 --> 02:03.440]  course is giving the same banks that orchestrated this more power more
[02:03.440 --> 02:09.160]  control and paying carbon taxes to them do you agree with me that they have
[02:09.160 --> 02:12.440]  fully committed to bringing us into a depression to break our will and make us
[02:12.440 --> 02:20.200]  dependent on the government do you have ideas of how to avert this I believe we
[02:20.200 --> 02:26.760]  must get the word out now about who was behind this because if we point out that
[02:26.760 --> 02:32.080]  this is a criminal Ponzi scheme and refuse to go along with the expansion in
[02:32.080 --> 02:36.520]  their takeover we do have a chance of taking our governments back and bringing
[02:36.520 --> 02:42.160]  these people to justice and trying to get our society back on track so what
[02:42.160 --> 02:50.120]  are your ideas for solutions and to get the word out that's a and b do you agree
[02:50.120 --> 02:55.120]  with me that we are entering a collapse that could be road warrior like in its
[02:55.120 --> 02:59.080]  implications and when I say a collapse is imminent we're already in a depression
[02:59.080 --> 03:02.840]  according to every historical yardstick we've had countless top economists on
[03:02.840 --> 03:06.680]  agreeing with that analysis in the last three years and now there's no doubt of
[03:06.680 --> 03:11.880]  it the question is how deep will it get and will we allow the globalist to use
[03:11.880 --> 03:16.680]  this crisis to fully convert our society into a high-tech oppressive
[03:16.680 --> 03:27.160]  tyranny the toll-free number to join us is 1-800-259-9231-1800-2599231 we
[03:27.160 --> 03:31.240]  come back I'm gonna play a short video that we just produced titled road warrior
[03:31.240 --> 03:35.040]  level collapse imminent where I boil all this down in six and a half minutes
[03:35.040 --> 03:39.600]  then I will get into some of the other news and then at the 24 after when we
[03:39.600 --> 03:44.000]  come in live from that break we will start taking your phone calls for the
[03:44.000 --> 03:47.680]  balance of the hour and then to continue to discuss this issue will be Paul
[03:47.680 --> 03:51.320]  Joseph Watson the next hour will also discuss all these different government
[03:51.320 --> 03:55.280]  heads and White House and former White House advisors saying Obama needs a
[03:55.280 --> 03:59.800]  terror attack on the order of 9-11 or at least Oklahoma City so that he can
[03:59.800 --> 04:04.080]  quote be seen as a strong leader amazing statements by Robert Shapiro and
[04:04.080 --> 04:08.280]  others and so we'll be chronicling the history of government and media people
[04:08.280 --> 04:12.720]  and CIA operatives and others openly saying that they need terror attacks and
[04:12.720 --> 04:18.120]  how great they are of course we saw CNN host two days ago say similar things
[04:18.120 --> 04:22.720]  there's no doubt that they are exacerbating the BP oil spill to get
[04:22.720 --> 04:25.360]  more power and control and as a diversion going into the elections
[04:25.360 --> 04:29.120]  there's no doubt now they're gearing up for war with Iran there's no doubt we're
[04:29.120 --> 04:33.080]  in a depression and they're exacerbating it every way they can there's no doubt
[04:33.080 --> 04:36.480]  major police departments nationwide are announcing they're not going to protect
[04:36.480 --> 04:40.600]  people from hardcore crime the police are being converted purely to tax
[04:40.600 --> 04:45.400]  collectors they're telling the public not only are we gonna raise money off of
[04:45.400 --> 04:50.320]  you and raise your taxes and cut services but we are also gonna try to
[04:50.320 --> 04:54.400]  keep you from defending yourselves by curtailing the second amendment it's

[06:11.040 --> 06:15.080]  how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total
[06:15.080 --> 06:18.960]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[06:18.960 --> 06:23.000]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[06:23.000 --> 06:27.400]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[06:27.400 --> 06:31.680]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[06:31.680 --> 06:35.400]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages number
[06:35.400 --> 06:39.600]  five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of
[06:39.600 --> 06:42.960]  mind folks I really believe in the solar power generators offered by solution

[08:50.160 --> 09:00.920]  Alex Jimmy show we're live it's Thursday July 15 2000 and Jan Paul Watson coming up
[09:00.920 --> 09:05.240]  via video link from England to cover the fact that we have more and more
[09:05.240 --> 09:09.600]  government officials saying they need a stage terror attack to get Obama's
[09:09.600 --> 09:14.480]  globalist takeover back on track and of course we have written several articles
[09:14.480 --> 09:19.160]  the last few days at info wars.com and prison planet.com dealing with the main
[09:19.160 --> 09:26.160]  issue everything else orbits this issue America stands on the precipice of total
[09:26.160 --> 09:30.920]  collapse and we're going to be breaking that down today we're already in a
[09:30.920 --> 09:37.080]  depression the question is how deep and how long will it be it is a orchestrated
[09:37.080 --> 09:42.160]  event to convert us to total serfdom we have another article that we posted at
[09:42.160 --> 09:46.520]  info wars.com last night written by myself and Aaron Dykes with a key
[09:46.520 --> 09:51.440]  six and a half minute video press release emergency warning titled road
[09:51.440 --> 09:56.720]  warrior level collapse imminent and in the scale of society a year is the
[09:56.720 --> 10:02.520]  twinkling of an eye Alex Jones says we must take corrective action now
[10:02.520 --> 10:06.880]  collapse is imminent the globalists have gone from denying that they've
[10:06.880 --> 10:10.560]  orchestrated a collapse to now trying to fear monger everyone into giving them
[10:10.560 --> 10:14.000]  even more power out of the collapse that they've orchestrated so I want to play
[10:14.000 --> 10:18.320]  this video clip then we're going to get into study attack on Iran would start
[10:18.320 --> 10:24.840]  long war major respected study and we've also got reports cap and trade bill
[10:24.840 --> 10:29.840]  will be part of soon it climate bill they're set to pass the banking takeover
[10:29.840 --> 10:33.880]  bill the federal reserve dictatorship over all financial activities the entire
[10:33.880 --> 10:37.920]  economy that's Ron Paul's words and judge hannah polytano's words not just
[10:37.920 --> 10:43.160]  mine this is hardcore serious also the Justice Department is is suing Arizona
[10:43.160 --> 10:47.920]  but saying they're not going to sue 800 plus sanctuary cities that refuse to
[10:47.920 --> 10:51.560]  arrest illegal aliens even when they commit crimes that's what the government
[10:51.560 --> 10:56.680]  likes because they are allied with all criminals that's why this criminal
[10:56.680 --> 10:59.680]  government is now announcing everywhere that they're not going to protect you
[10:59.680 --> 11:06.080]  from robbery and from looting and from grand theft auto because the police are
[11:06.080 --> 11:11.360]  being converted publicly to 100% tax collectors and to crack the heads of
[11:11.360 --> 11:17.480]  blood bags that citizens blood suppliers for the parasite system this is a total
[11:17.480 --> 11:20.760]  conversion to pure evil that is happening right now and they mean to
[11:20.760 --> 11:24.480]  break our will through the depression we're now entering we've been in a
[11:24.480 --> 11:27.800]  depression for a while but they're publicly now bringing us into deep
[11:27.800 --> 11:33.960]  depression so this hydra of the new world order this giant squid of tyranny is
[11:33.960 --> 11:38.440]  dragging us to the bottom of the icy depths of despotism but right now let's
[11:38.440 --> 11:42.960]  go ahead and play this special video I'm asking everyone to get the video and the
[11:42.960 --> 11:48.200]  audio at info wars calm and prison planet calm and to get it out to every
[11:48.200 --> 11:52.600]  one you know the video was titled road warrior level collapse imminent it's
[11:52.600 --> 11:57.000]  also up on our YouTube channel but here it is ladies and gentlemen streamed live
[11:57.000 --> 12:02.200]  the radio TV viewing audience
[12:02.200 --> 12:12.920]  my friends the United States is transitioning from a free nation to a
[12:12.920 --> 12:19.360]  police state the country as we know it is ceasing to exist on every front
[12:19.360 --> 12:23.960]  private central banks took over the United States in 1913 they've uses as an
[12:23.960 --> 12:27.440]  engine of global domination and now they've basically run up the country's
[12:27.440 --> 12:31.720]  credit card and preparing to bankrupt this nation by design here's CNN central
[12:31.720 --> 12:35.120]  banks start to abandon the US dollar there's mounting evidence the central
[12:35.120 --> 12:39.520]  banks have little faith in the green back these days can we blame them like
[12:39.520 --> 12:42.840]  they're the good guys and they're just trying to save us when they're the
[12:42.840 --> 12:48.560]  admitted authors of the catastrophe that is now unfolding and I'm gonna cover
[12:48.560 --> 12:52.720]  that information in a moment but first I want to define austerity this is what
[12:52.720 --> 12:55.600]  the IMF and World Bank the private holding companies for the private
[12:55.600 --> 12:58.600]  central banks have done all over the world they go in they get countries in
[12:58.600 --> 13:02.680]  debt by design it's all fiat loans that they give them so they gain the world
[13:02.680 --> 13:06.840]  through nothing it's like an Aladdin's lamp it's just it's just free money but
[13:06.840 --> 13:10.000]  with it they're able to conquer the world that's what Thomas Jefferson said
[13:10.000 --> 13:13.680]  that if you ever let private banks issue the currency and credit our children
[13:13.680 --> 13:17.800]  would wake up homeless on the continent that our forefathers had conquered and
[13:17.800 --> 13:22.160]  that's now happening you look at the austerity systems they set up in the
[13:22.160 --> 13:27.320]  third world it's now being done to Greece to Spain to the United States they
[13:27.320 --> 13:31.880]  take giant loans that they can never pay back then when the society collapses the
[13:31.880 --> 13:36.600]  very banks come in and loan them more fiat money and now it's happening here
[13:36.600 --> 13:41.480]  notice what's developing in Arizona Obama told Senator Kyle that well I'm
[13:41.480 --> 13:44.560]  gonna let that crisis and all the thousands of deaths and lawlessness
[13:44.560 --> 13:48.880]  continue because this crisis is good to get amnesty passed that's holding the
[13:48.880 --> 13:54.320]  country hostage and what's happening in places like Ohio major sheriff
[13:54.320 --> 13:58.040]  departments are laying off more than half of their deputies and saying the
[13:58.040 --> 14:01.720]  deputies they're keeping are going to be there for revenue generation riding
[14:01.720 --> 14:07.040]  you tickets putting people in jail for unpaid fines but not responding to crime
[14:07.040 --> 14:15.000]  in fact in one county WKYC NBC reports that they're going to lay off of the
[14:15.000 --> 14:20.400]  vast majority of their deputies from 112 to 49 but the sheriffs being honest
[14:20.400 --> 14:24.520]  there he's saying go out and buy a gun you've got to protect yourself and now
[14:24.520 --> 14:28.160]  the police in Oakland California are holding the population hostage saying
[14:28.160 --> 14:32.920]  look if we don't raise taxes if we don't get more funding we're not going to be
[14:32.920 --> 14:36.800]  able to respond to serious crimes the police are saying we're not going to
[14:36.800 --> 14:41.600]  respond to Grand Theft Auto to burglary to muggings to all of these serious
[14:41.600 --> 14:46.040]  things and as the government grows you don't get essential services like
[14:46.040 --> 14:49.680]  bridges and roads being fixed those are falling apart you don't get police and
[14:49.680 --> 14:54.400]  fire Los Angeles is announcing we're not going to fix the sidewalks now all you
[14:54.400 --> 14:58.080]  get is a parasitic government basically feeding off of you and it's
[14:58.080 --> 15:02.880]  outrageous the police are saying we're not going to protect you now the
[15:02.880 --> 15:06.280]  Supreme Court has always ruled the police have no liability to protect you
[15:06.280 --> 15:10.040]  that it's your job protect yourself they respond after a crime has been
[15:10.040 --> 15:13.720]  committed but now they're being completely honest about this and saying look
[15:13.720 --> 15:17.800]  you're here for revenue generation for the government but there's a lot of good
[15:17.800 --> 15:22.440]  news coming in Arizona newspapers are reporting that the freeway speed
[15:22.440 --> 15:28.000]  cameras are being removed from the entire state because the vast majority of
[15:28.000 --> 15:32.920]  the population have refused to pay the tickets there is now non-compliance
[15:32.920 --> 15:37.840]  happening all over the state of Arizona not only to the illegal alien invasion
[15:37.840 --> 15:42.320]  and the designed implosion of the country to merge us into the North
[15:42.320 --> 15:46.800]  American Union which is officially stated by the last two White Houses but
[15:46.800 --> 15:50.920]  now the public is wearing guns in the open they're not paying speeding tickets
[15:50.920 --> 15:54.320]  they're saying you're an illegitimate government and we're not going along with
[15:54.320 --> 15:57.520]  this and the government is having to back off there's another example out of
[15:57.520 --> 16:01.600]  USA Today there is a huge backlash against the naked body scanners they
[16:01.600 --> 16:05.320]  admit they are recording or naked genitals it is a biometric scam that's
[16:05.320 --> 16:08.280]  being stored we've had airport employees getting fist fights when other
[16:08.280 --> 16:12.160]  employees make fun of the size of their sexual organs and the airlines are
[16:12.160 --> 16:16.480]  getting upset because people aren't flying anymore and the feds are starting
[16:16.480 --> 16:21.360]  to have to back off what they originally did they were trying to break our will to
[16:21.360 --> 16:26.520]  condition us to make a submit so the moral the story is when we say no we can
[16:26.520 --> 16:30.480]  have an effect and we've got to continue to say no and say no in greater
[16:30.480 --> 16:34.200]  numbers because the time is short this orchestrated implosion of the world
[16:34.200 --> 16:40.120]  economy is a military form of financial terrorism I told my listeners 11 years
[16:40.120 --> 16:42.960]  ago when they got rid of the Glass-Steagall Act that derivatives would
[16:42.960 --> 16:46.920]  be used to bankrupt our nation and every other wealthy nation because I've seen
[16:46.920 --> 16:50.940]  the very same private banks do this in the third world and now here we are 11
[16:50.940 --> 16:55.380]  years later it's happening and whether it's the New York Times or CNBC they
[16:55.380 --> 17:00.600]  are admitting that we are now in a depression but even more importantly the
[17:00.600 --> 17:05.240]  communist Chinese who hold the majority of European and US debt have now
[17:05.240 --> 17:10.920]  downgraded the United States in Europe they are turning us into actual debtor
[17:10.920 --> 17:15.720]  slaves and suddenly the globalist think tanks are announcing China will be the
[17:15.720 --> 17:20.040]  future and the base of the new one-world government will be China this is high
[17:20.040 --> 17:23.840]  treason by the leaders of our nation who have always wanted to destroy this
[17:23.840 --> 17:27.760]  country and convert it to a collectivist system where they can manipulate and
[17:27.760 --> 17:32.120]  control every facet of our lives the bad news is out there we are going into a
[17:32.120 --> 17:35.680]  global depression it has been engineered by design but the good news is
[17:35.680 --> 17:40.200]  worldwide the population is waking up and it's a big presence he said two
[17:40.200 --> 17:43.160]  months ago that the elite are in trouble because for the first time in

[17:48.160 --> 17:53.240]  time in modern history our society is at a crossroads and everything you do to
[17:53.240 --> 17:58.120]  get the word out about this outrageous crime that's taking place brings us one
[17:58.120 --> 18:02.400]  step closer to defeating these people we must say no to the new global currency
[18:02.400 --> 18:07.600]  in the sdr's we must say no to devaluing the dollar we must say no to
[18:07.600 --> 18:11.480]  the financial reform bill that actually gives these bankers more control over our
[18:11.480 --> 18:16.320]  economy we must stand up and defend the republic and restore our constitution and

[22:02.240 --> 22:05.640]  with the Federal Reserve note and understand the risks of deficit spending
[22:05.640 --> 22:09.520]  therefore with catastrophic events it comes as no surprise that some banks
[22:09.520 --> 22:12.840]  have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove
[22:12.840 --> 22:16.720]  from their accounts a fractional reserve system means only a small portion of
[22:16.720 --> 22:20.200]  your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal deficit spending
[22:20.200 --> 22:23.840]  will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to ensure deposits
[22:23.840 --> 22:27.520]  during a bank run followed by a depressed economy a current effort is
[22:27.520 --> 22:31.440]  underway by the Fed along with other central banks to increase liquidity for
[22:31.440 --> 22:35.240]  depositors however an increase in money supply without equal expansion and
[22:35.240 --> 22:39.240]  productivity can cause inflation in order to achieve strength and stability
[22:39.240 --> 22:43.080]  I recommend a conservative portion of all investments to be calmly
[22:43.080 --> 22:47.200]  repositioned into gold and silver while paper investments currently have been
[22:47.200 --> 22:52.160]  driven by debt gold on its own has held value for over 6,000 years for more

[24:09.880 --> 24:16.880]  really do want to hear from you about the designed perpetrated depression we're
[24:16.880 --> 24:22.200]  entering they now admit it's a depression but the bigger question is how
[24:22.200 --> 24:27.040]  do we reverse this depression and how bad is it going to get you agree with me
[24:27.040 --> 24:31.160]  that total collapse is imminent when all over the country they're laying off
[24:31.160 --> 24:36.240]  large portions of the police departments they're telling employees that you're
[24:36.240 --> 24:39.600]  going to be paid minimum wage now that work for state government the federal
[24:39.600 --> 24:43.680]  government's growing and increasing their wages the federal government is
[24:43.680 --> 24:49.720]  engaged in a bankruptcy by design just like banks repossess your home just like
[24:49.720 --> 24:53.240]  they hope you won't make the payments or hope you won't make payments on the
[24:53.240 --> 24:57.080]  farm it's the same thing for our nation and that's what we're discussing here
[24:57.080 --> 25:02.000]  today let's go to Bruce in Michigan you're on the air Bruce hi Alex how you
[25:02.000 --> 25:06.160]  doing I'm doing all right my friend I'm still alive and kicking right on
[25:06.160 --> 25:11.640]  everything you said is true yes then the depression that is coming is going to be
[25:11.640 --> 25:19.360]  worse than anybody could ever conceive about 29 because I would say 85% of the
[25:19.360 --> 25:24.560]  people of this country in this country are not prepared you know they don't
[25:24.560 --> 25:28.280]  I mean even back in the old depression beyond my grandparents I'm from New
[25:28.280 --> 25:32.640]  Jersey originally would tell me you know we know we grew food in the
[25:32.640 --> 25:37.160]  flower pots you know people would grow food up on the roofs of their homes if
[25:37.160 --> 25:42.640]  they had flat flat the flat roofs you know and with kids today especially in
[25:42.640 --> 25:45.560]  the last several generations with the dumbing down with television and
[25:45.560 --> 25:49.800]  entertainment they wouldn't even begin to know how to survive if they had that's
[25:49.800 --> 25:52.800]  it I mean and actually the numbers higher than any five the government
[25:52.800 --> 25:57.400]  estimates 90% are urban and are not self-sufficient less than half of the 10
[25:57.400 --> 26:03.480]  percent that are rural are self-sufficient and so if you had 90% that
[26:03.480 --> 26:07.040]  were self-sufficient before and millions to starve to death and increase in crime
[26:07.040 --> 26:11.200]  what's gonna happen now with this decadent population well the government
[26:11.200 --> 26:14.920]  thinks they're gonna come to the system and say we'll do whatever you say we'll
[26:14.920 --> 26:19.480]  accept wars tyranny anything just give us our entertainment give us our six
[26:19.480 --> 26:23.320]  pack of beer and that's why the globalists are doing this so they can
[26:23.320 --> 26:28.160]  sell the public on a new way of life and total collectivism that's why they're
[26:28.160 --> 26:32.880]  breaking us by design that's in the IMF and World Bank plans and the bigger
[26:32.880 --> 26:36.880]  issue is then what are we going to do about it as they take all these
[26:36.880 --> 26:41.880]  domesticated jellyfish and put them on the rocks basically wreck them and then
[26:41.880 --> 26:46.920]  point these hordes of dumbed-down slobs at those of us that are self-sufficient
[26:46.920 --> 26:51.440]  well I think what I think what you have to do there and I meet with a group of
[26:51.440 --> 26:55.840]  people on every Thursday night we watch your videos other other videos in this
[26:55.840 --> 26:59.880]  type of math subject matter and everybody's pretty well self-sufficient
[26:59.880 --> 27:05.760]  in our group we feel that possibly what you're looking at is maybe getting one
[27:05.760 --> 27:11.360]  state or a couple of states together in an area that just remove themselves from
[27:11.360 --> 27:15.640]  the union and we start from there well I mean listen 36 states are already
[27:15.640 --> 27:19.720]  saying we're just going to nullify all these federal taxes because you take our
[27:19.720 --> 27:24.280]  money and you send a small portion back with strings attached we can't survive
[27:24.280 --> 27:28.120]  and so that's why the globalist realized they're going to try to break the
[27:28.120 --> 27:31.480]  states but they got the John Warner Defense Authorization Act that they
[27:31.480 --> 27:35.760]  stated is to suppress the states and the governors and the legislatures and so
[27:35.760 --> 27:39.000]  that's why they're preparing another Oklahoma City bombing to blame it on the
[27:39.000 --> 27:42.480]  states rights movement as I've been saying for over a year now even the
[27:42.480 --> 27:46.320]  globalists are saying they may stage an Oklahoma City event and blame it on us
[27:46.320 --> 27:50.040]  so we've got to be ready for that and I want to tell the controllers something
[27:50.040 --> 27:53.240]  and they're not stupid they already know this the public's going to know it's you
[27:53.240 --> 27:56.960]  that carries out the terror attack you may fool some of the people but it's not
[27:56.960 --> 28:02.080]  going to be the majority like you did in 95 or 2001 and so we've got a fighting
[28:02.080 --> 28:06.360]  chance but that's why before they stage it it's so important to get the word out
[28:06.360 --> 28:10.240]  now because if we get the word out to a great enough level they may back off and
[28:10.240 --> 28:13.960]  not stage it or you know that's the best case scenario but there's three
[28:13.960 --> 28:17.600]  scenarios best cases they don't do it because they know we're on to them the
[28:17.600 --> 28:22.160]  second best scenario is they do it but we've woken up so many people it backfires
[28:22.160 --> 28:26.360]  on them to the fact that it's a staged event and of course see the worst
[28:26.360 --> 28:30.920]  scenario the people buy it the globalists win that's why it's vital to
[28:30.920 --> 28:34.720]  reach out to police and military now and to show them the paradigm so they're
[28:34.720 --> 28:39.240]  wise to it God bless you appreciate the call anything else Bruce could I say
[28:39.240 --> 28:44.040]  one more thing yes sir yeah okay and I just the only reason I'm even bringing
[28:44.040 --> 28:47.560]  this up is because when this when this event went down up here in Michigan
[28:47.560 --> 28:53.160]  recently you were directly drug into this and I work in a bookstore I'm not
[28:53.160 --> 28:58.200]  going to name the store Carl was in there signing about a month ago and you

[29:01.640 --> 29:05.240]  we're in there getting their autographs from his book and in the middle of this
[29:05.240 --> 29:10.040]  whole thing this I'm watching this guy's about six foot seven and he's got a big
[29:10.040 --> 29:16.120]  brilly voice and he just starts cursing at Carl old go back to Bilderberg you

[29:35.600 --> 29:40.280]  these old ladies are going God bless you Carl we love you and then I heard
[29:40.280 --> 29:44.360]  several of them going who's this Alex Jones he sounds like some kind of a
[29:44.360 --> 29:48.800]  troublemaker he ought to be arrested and thrown in jail well stay there stay

[33:05.760 --> 33:14.200]  resistance you're listening to the Alex Jones show unfortunately this is the
[33:14.200 --> 33:17.480]  heart of the resistance if you had to mark the landscape of the world the
[33:17.480 --> 33:21.840]  resistance against tyranny it'd be Ron Paul Alex Jones and a handful of others
[33:21.840 --> 33:26.280]  that's why we need your prayers and support now this may have been a
[33:26.280 --> 33:30.240]  fellow in Michigan who was simply upset and fed up by his state being destroyed
[33:30.240 --> 33:35.840]  Karl Rove now pay poses as an anti-New World Order patriot by setting himself
[33:35.840 --> 33:39.800]  against Obama who's continued everything Bush did and Bush himself was just a
[33:39.800 --> 33:43.500]  puppet and so is Karl Rove he's nothing compared to as a Bignan
[33:43.500 --> 33:49.480]  Brzezinski or a Henry Kissinger but he is more powerful and important than a
[33:49.480 --> 33:56.040]  George W. Bush but we do need to be stern and focused and serious but cuss words
[33:56.040 --> 33:59.160]  and things like that are not needed in public events and it does make us look
[33:59.160 --> 34:03.560]  bad but the guy might have been a fed it might have been a provocateur or it may
[34:03.560 --> 34:07.560]  have been real but finish up Bruce with your story at the bookstore in
[34:07.560 --> 34:12.120]  Michigan well the only thing I wanted to say about Alex's is when that type of
[34:12.120 --> 34:16.320]  event goes down like that you know and here you've got these old ladies who
[34:16.320 --> 34:22.240]  never even heard of you and and probably think we're all a bunch of lunatics and
[34:22.240 --> 34:26.720]  you know it's for you to for me here several of them going well it's Alex
[34:26.720 --> 34:30.760]  Jones should be arrested and people think like him should be arrested that
[34:30.760 --> 34:34.920]  doesn't do a lot of good for our cause but it's not really the fault of the guy
[34:34.920 --> 34:38.720]  even though it sounds like what he said was a little out of taste it's their
[34:38.720 --> 34:42.560]  fault for having a mindset about we need to arrest people that are mean to our
[34:42.560 --> 34:47.560]  precious Carl Rove I mean all he did was calling an SOB oh no it was worse than
[34:47.560 --> 34:51.600]  that it was I won't even I won't even give you the initial oh well and that
[34:51.600 --> 34:56.480]  sounds like you probably was let's let's let's let's talk on the terms of like
[34:56.480 --> 35:01.560]  Andrew Dice Clay giving a live comedy performance okay that kind of language
[35:01.560 --> 35:05.120]  and but he was bringing up the Bilderbergs and he was bringing up the
[35:05.120 --> 35:09.440]  trilateral commission and that was all cool and he and he told him go back to
[35:09.440 --> 35:13.560]  but he didn't grow you sick so how did this end did they did they drag him out
[35:13.560 --> 35:19.440]  all we they had to escort him out of the store and it went as was going on and the
[35:19.440 --> 35:24.080]  thing was he was so he was a grizzly Adams type size guy and with a big
[35:24.080 --> 35:28.720]  booming voice so that was even more intimidating to these poor ladies but
[35:28.720 --> 35:32.640]  you know the whole thing is yeah you're right they do need to wake up
[35:32.640 --> 35:38.120]  themselves but for a guy to come in like that if it was staged naturally they
[35:38.120 --> 35:42.840]  were taking shots at you if he was being passionate about it I'm just saying
[35:42.840 --> 35:46.760]  maybe the listeners need to come down a little bit just now Bruce and Bruce I
[35:46.760 --> 35:52.240]  hear you I hear you we've got to be you know very wise about what we do but but
[35:52.240 --> 35:56.720]  going back to Carl Rove Carl Rove admittedly planted a bug in his own
[35:56.720 --> 36:02.280]  office during a Texas campaign to blame it on their political enemies he does
[36:02.280 --> 36:06.520]  do little mini false flags the police have been caught from Greece to Canada
[36:06.520 --> 36:10.040]  to the United States you know in the news I mean Denver just a few years ago
[36:10.040 --> 36:14.440]  attacking their own officers in front of news cameras dressed as protesters so
[36:14.440 --> 36:17.960]  that that could be staged I mean what do we know has been staged against me
[36:17.960 --> 36:22.360]  when in three hours of Joe Stack flying his aircraft reportedly into the
[36:22.360 --> 36:28.360]  echelon building in north Austin off 183 with the stack attack the Austin
[36:28.360 --> 36:32.760]  America statesman in the Newark Daily News said that I was praising it when
[36:32.760 --> 36:37.880]  before my name was even in the news an hour in ten minutes after it happened I
[36:37.880 --> 36:40.920]  was on air that day it happened about an hour and ten minutes before I got on
[36:40.920 --> 36:47.600]  air happened what about 955 I'm on air at 11 so I guess less than an hour and
[36:47.600 --> 36:52.240]  ten minutes to be technical I went on air and I said you watch they're gonna
[36:52.240 --> 36:58.560]  blame this on me and it looks like this is staged and sure enough that happened
[36:58.560 --> 37:03.560]  now remember within two hours of Richard Poplowski and Pittsburgh killing the
[37:03.560 --> 37:08.240]  three cops in cold blood it was all my fault and he was my fan we search engines
[37:08.240 --> 37:12.440]  at his name and his handle he was all over info wars in prison planet saying
[37:12.440 --> 37:15.800]  I was a horrible piece of garbage that worked for Israel which of course isn't
[37:15.800 --> 37:22.040]  even true and that I was evil because I'm not for violence and of course it
[37:22.040 --> 37:25.800]  came out he visited thousands of websites and attacked me on scores of them
[37:25.800 --> 37:30.640]  but when they got into his computer they instantly came out and said it was my
[37:30.640 --> 37:35.040]  fault and now David from and other Bilderberg group members will put his
[37:35.040 --> 37:40.680]  image on screen if we can David from just in the last two months has written
[37:40.680 --> 37:45.440]  several articles just search engine Alex Jones David from saying I'm this big
[37:45.440 --> 37:50.400]  dangerous enemy that I'm bad that I've got to be dealt with so it is creepy I
[37:50.400 --> 37:54.880]  mean it is creepy that the Southern Poverty Law Center the ADL they've got
[37:54.880 --> 38:00.840]  me at the top of their hit list because I won't do what their minions do it has
[38:00.840 --> 38:03.760]  come out the Southern Poverty Law Center infiltrated and was running the
[38:03.760 --> 38:08.440]  Elohim City white supremacist compound that McVeigh was in that's come out in
[38:08.440 --> 38:13.720]  from lawsuits in declassified FBI memos turns out the Justice Department was
[38:13.720 --> 38:16.440]  running the whole thing and did have their head of counterterrorism in
[38:16.440 --> 38:21.480]  Oklahoma in the days before and they lied about that I exposed the fact many
[38:21.480 --> 38:24.920]  of their operatives white supremacist leaders that we've named here decades
[38:24.920 --> 38:30.840]  ago over a decade ago like Hal Turner who's hooked in with Sean Hannity I
[38:30.840 --> 38:34.080]  said he is a federal agent that's now come out in federal court he is a
[38:34.080 --> 38:39.120]  federal agent not just an not just an operative and so they're very upset with
[38:39.120 --> 38:43.520]  me because they don't want a patriot movement that is for whites blacks
[38:43.520 --> 38:48.240]  Hispanics and Asians and Jews and Catholics and Protestants and Hindus and
[38:48.240 --> 38:52.600]  Muslims I'm a Christian that's what I believe in I'm a Protestant that's what
[38:52.600 --> 38:57.240]  I believe in but I don't I don't make my show about that issue it's about just
[38:57.240 --> 39:00.960]  warning people about what's going on and I believe everybody wants liberty and
[39:00.960 --> 39:03.920]  freedom except for a few thousand globalist and they're on record saying
[39:03.920 --> 39:08.720]  that and so they don't like me they don't like the fact that the leading light
[39:08.720 --> 39:13.360]  and the leading voice out there who successfully waking up the most new
[39:13.360 --> 39:18.520]  people to the true paradigm is making it a big tent they have always put white
[39:18.520 --> 39:21.560]  supremacist groups and Mexican supremacist groups and black supremacist
[39:21.560 --> 39:25.200]  groups out there as the leading edge of a rebellion against tyranny to make it
[39:25.200 --> 39:29.160]  look asinine and ridiculous and that does sound like a false flag that you
[39:29.160 --> 39:33.320]  witnessed or somebody who's just fed up but I appreciate your call now let's try
[39:33.320 --> 39:36.880]  to hurry through calls now but that was a key issue he just raised Lex in Ohio
[39:36.880 --> 39:42.360]  you're on the air Alex I agree with you that a collapse is coming I think an
[39:42.360 --> 39:47.320]  internet kind of scare is a great way to sort of go along with that collapse
[39:47.320 --> 39:51.840]  because it would absolutely great point the oil spill as the as the
[39:51.840 --> 39:56.400]  environmental disaster the key to the new world order as Gorbachev said the
[39:56.400 --> 40:03.160]  Iran war as a giant global distraction the economic implosion the open
[40:03.160 --> 40:06.640]  borders but yes they're definitely gearing up for a fake cyber attack
[40:06.640 --> 40:10.360]  against our system as a pretext to bring in control because if they leave the
[40:10.360 --> 40:15.880]  internet up we're going to beat them so I have an info bomb fail safe I want to
[40:15.880 --> 40:22.680]  run by you what I did is I googled Ohio a.m. stations and I got this huge list
[40:22.680 --> 40:29.640]  and so then I sent one email with tons of addresses to station managers and
[40:29.640 --> 40:33.920]  programming directors asking them to carry the Alex Jones show so I'm
[40:33.920 --> 40:37.440]  challenging your listeners right now all the other info wars to do the same
[40:37.440 --> 40:43.440]  thing Google your state name a.m. radio stations and what I would ask you Alex
[40:43.440 --> 40:47.040]  is to say help me out what information should they include in their version I
[40:47.040 --> 40:49.840]  just said hey show this you know put the show on but maybe you could put some
[40:49.840 --> 40:52.960]  buzzwords you know they're industry-specific you just tell them you
[40:52.960 --> 40:58.760]  can send them an Alexa screenshot of my website being massively bigger just
[40:58.760 --> 41:04.860]  one of my two twin mega sites info wars being bigger than Rush Limbaugh's website
[41:04.860 --> 41:08.760]  bigger than Glenbeck's website bigger than Savage's site in fact you can
[41:08.760 --> 41:13.320]  combine their sites together and info wars commas bigger and just say look at
[41:13.320 --> 41:18.360]  this and look he's on the cover of radio ink he's in talkers magazine you know
[41:18.360 --> 41:23.000]  you know here's you can pull up the ratings stations that pick us up get
[41:23.000 --> 41:28.080]  massive listenerships you know increases immediately everything this guy's talked
[41:28.080 --> 41:31.560]  about coming true you know the drugs reports linking to him every couple of
[41:31.560 --> 41:34.880]  days now this information you know this guy is now coming out of the
[41:34.880 --> 41:39.040]  wilderness this information is now becoming mainstream you'll get listeners
[41:39.040 --> 41:43.280]  it's patriotic pick up the show and then point them to the GCN live.com
[41:43.280 --> 41:48.200]  affiliate page with the satellites all of it other networks when they pick up
[41:48.200 --> 41:52.080]  one show they try to make the stations pick up other shows they try to make
[41:52.080 --> 41:56.600]  them sign year-long contracts they try to strong arm them Genesis is carry it
[41:56.600 --> 41:59.760]  will it's just you've signed the affiliate agreement to carry half our
[41:59.760 --> 42:04.240]  ads half their ads are theirs it's the most liberal and open and pro station
[42:04.240 --> 42:10.840]  affiliate system out there and so I mean it's well produced it's power packed
[42:10.840 --> 42:16.160]  it's well documented and yes that's why I'm on WWCR as a backup 100,000 watt
[42:16.160 --> 42:20.360]  shortwave we're on the satellite we're gaining new affiliates several every
[42:20.360 --> 42:24.200]  week this is the fastest growth right we've ever had and of course we are
[42:24.200 --> 42:27.440]  number one this is the number one show on the internet you tell them the market
[42:27.440 --> 42:32.960]  is spoken give us Alex Jones shadow the left-right paradigm and believe me most
[42:32.960 --> 42:35.840]  stations already know about us that's why they're picking us up they can pick
[42:35.840 --> 42:40.240]  up we have a satellite that rears at 24 hours a day a lot of stations are
[42:40.240 --> 42:43.480]  recording one show on others live and so it gets hard for them with limited
[42:43.480 --> 42:46.520]  staff to be able to take the show when it's live record it and play it later
[42:46.520 --> 42:51.320]  tell them no no this is 24 hours a day Genesis has a satellite you know after
[42:51.320 --> 42:55.480]  we're not live retransmitting it so that they can record it re-air it or play it
[42:55.480 --> 43:00.600]  whenever they want or take the stream live I mean it's just there's so many
[43:00.600 --> 43:09.520]  ways to pick up the transmission and it's so easy to do anything else Lex I
[43:09.520 --> 43:13.560]  just want to throw it I just write back out to your listeners and your viewers
[43:13.560 --> 43:18.840]  it's really easy this took me 20 minutes maybe to accumulate the emails and cut
[43:18.840 --> 43:22.280]  them paste or the addresses and cut them paste them in there but now I've got it
[43:22.280 --> 43:25.240]  you know it's in my sent messages I can just keep bugging these guys and I can
[43:25.240 --> 43:28.600]  keep adding more addresses to it it stays in your you know in your sent mail
[43:28.600 --> 43:31.800]  and you just keep accumulating this list and we can reach more and more people
[43:31.800 --> 43:37.520]  thank you for your time Alex thank you I appreciate your call look the biggest
[43:37.520 --> 43:41.920]  shows in the country have 600 400 affiliates and the fact that we're well
[43:41.920 --> 43:45.160]  over 70 that's quite a few but a lot of them are small mom and pops and they're
[43:45.160 --> 43:48.360]  precious and they reach a lot of people some are big major stations and major
[43:48.360 --> 43:52.360]  markets now but generally owned by private families or smaller media groups
[43:52.360 --> 43:57.680]  the big three syndicators tend to own their own stations so they've got a
[43:57.680 --> 44:03.080]  oligopoly that's the major problem and I have over the years been approached by
[44:03.080 --> 44:07.760]  some of the bigger networks but I would not have editorial control over what I
[44:07.760 --> 44:11.800]  do on my show and so I've turned it down I mean I mean here's an example
[44:11.800 --> 44:16.360]  history channel just wanted me to be in a big show about the Illuminati and I
[44:16.360 --> 44:20.000]  was thinking about doing it but you know what I don't care about just getting
[44:20.000 --> 44:24.240]  my face on TV most people would kill to be on a history channel show that's
[44:24.240 --> 44:27.200]  gonna air literally hundreds of times in the next five years because they air
[44:27.200 --> 44:31.080]  those shows over and over again I'm just not gonna do it I'm constantly offered
[44:31.080 --> 44:35.800]  reality TV shows money you know they come in here but I guarantee you they
[44:35.800 --> 44:40.360]  distort it they take the few goofy things out of months of videotape and
[44:40.360 --> 44:44.720]  distort what we do so I just don't care I know we're collapsing I know this the
[44:44.720 --> 44:49.360]  new order is real why would I care about being on TV and being a big shot when I
[44:49.360 --> 44:53.200]  literally see scores of articles a day admitting that they're putting poison in
[44:53.200 --> 44:58.640]  all our food all our water supplies in our air genetic engineering cancer
[44:58.640 --> 45:03.400]  exploding diabetes exploding sterilization and infertility exploding I
[45:03.400 --> 45:08.160]  mean once you realize what's really going on none of this stuff even matters
[45:08.160 --> 45:14.400]  and I'm not bragging and tooting my own horn I'm saying we've had a major
[45:14.400 --> 45:20.800]  effect but I don't have any desire to have my message distorted it is much
[45:20.800 --> 45:26.640]  more precious to be able to go on some little Christian station for an hour as
[45:26.640 --> 45:32.240]  a guest and talk about real issues in a long form with full ideas to unlock
[45:32.240 --> 45:35.760]  minds and shift paradigms or go on some talk station or sports station or
[45:35.760 --> 45:43.920]  morning zoo show as a guest for an hour and really reach say 5,000 10,000 20,000
[45:43.920 --> 45:48.400]  people and and maybe change their lives every one of those psyches that we
[45:48.400 --> 45:56.680]  unlock is a solely unlock to the wider universe and freedom and that's what I
[45:56.680 --> 46:04.800]  seek that's what I love that's what I desire that is wealth to me not physical
[46:04.800 --> 46:10.040]  wealth not my name being big I mean I already can't go to a restaurant
[46:10.040 --> 46:13.480]  anywhere in the country or walk down the street anywhere in the country without
[46:13.480 --> 46:19.120]  being stopped and I always like it because it resonates as a sonar ping that
[46:19.120 --> 46:23.920]  we're reaching people but at the same time I have lost my privacy so I have
[46:23.920 --> 46:28.520]  no desire just to be on big TV shows and I'm really thinking about just not
[46:28.520 --> 46:35.240]  doing any more taped interviews whether it's CNN Fox I mean I refuse to go on
[46:35.240 --> 46:38.200]  mancals Fox pilot because I don't want to fly to New York to be part of a
[46:38.200 --> 46:41.480]  taping so I sent a producer up there years ago and I've already done this a
[46:41.480 --> 46:46.880]  lot we're not here just seeking to have a big name do you understand that as I
[46:46.880 --> 46:50.840]  get closer to being an international phenomenon which has already really
[46:50.840 --> 46:57.920]  started I I march closer to being killed I march closer to Mount Doom to the
[46:57.920 --> 47:04.800]  crack of doom I mean this is not for the faint of heart this is not a joke this
[47:04.800 --> 47:10.120]  is real this is history being made here and I look back on I never intended to
[47:10.120 --> 47:17.160]  be this successful I never intended to be more and more the leader and I look
[47:17.160 --> 47:20.600]  back on things I did and things I was focused on and what I thought was
[47:20.600 --> 47:25.440]  important and I'm ashamed of myself I mean I was heads above most people
[47:25.440 --> 47:28.960]  morally I've always been someone who loves innocence loves goodness loves
[47:28.960 --> 47:33.760]  honor love strength loves courage I've always been someone who isn't envious
[47:33.760 --> 47:37.600]  and jealous and I didn't realize that most people are governed by that but as
[47:37.600 --> 47:42.800]  I gained some wisdom at 36 years and I gained more in every year than I knew
[47:42.800 --> 47:49.120]  previously in the 36 as I exponentially awaken and this is a process we're all
[47:49.120 --> 47:53.040]  going through I'm really beginning to realize what matters at the end of the
[47:53.040 --> 47:58.720]  day I mean I'm ready to die I'm ready to be in prison I'm ready to be destroyed
[47:58.720 --> 48:01.800]  I'm ready to be tortured I'm ready to have my name done to the mud I'm ready
[48:01.800 --> 48:06.680]  it's already happening because I know the message got through I know the
[48:06.680 --> 48:10.880]  transmission made it through to you and I was here to warn you and this is
[48:10.880 --> 48:16.240]  history being made this is history being made right now we accurately gauge
[48:16.240 --> 48:20.280]  the enemy operation their attack profile we accurately broke down what they were
[48:20.280 --> 48:25.720]  setting up and developing and we accurately made a defense against it
[48:25.720 --> 48:30.160]  and now we've had a huge effect globally to the level of the Bilderberg
[48:30.160 --> 48:35.240]  group specifically singles myself and Ron Paul out for destruction but because
[48:35.240 --> 48:39.880]  we are so prominent they understand that if they murder us or even destroy us
[48:39.880 --> 48:43.600]  people see through it and so I do have a hedge of protection up I don't know for
[48:43.600 --> 48:47.240]  how long and if it's God's will to lower the hedge today and that I'd be
[48:47.240 --> 48:52.800]  destroyed today I say so be it I want to live to be a hundred years old I love
[48:52.800 --> 49:00.680]  life I in fact the fact that I've given in to committing to this no matter where
[49:00.680 --> 49:05.040]  it leads the fact that I've committed makes life so much sweeter I mean the
[49:05.040 --> 49:10.160]  smell of the trees and and the feel of the wind and and just to look into the
[49:10.160 --> 49:13.800]  water at a lake and see perch swimming around and you know to see my sweet
[49:13.800 --> 49:18.600]  father or mother and how good they are and you know to just imagine them down
[49:18.600 --> 49:24.640]  the road becoming old and dying it's just it's all poetry and to see the
[49:24.640 --> 49:28.400]  innocence of my children how good they are and and to realize that all that
[49:28.400 --> 49:37.040]  matters is that we have a free world for them and for your children it is so
[49:37.040 --> 49:44.360]  real all that needs to be guarded is freedom if you have freedom everything
[49:44.360 --> 49:49.320]  else flows from it we must protect the good we must protect the pure we must
[49:49.320 --> 49:53.800]  protect the genetics of the plants and the animals and the humans that is the
[49:53.800 --> 49:59.200]  real environmental issue and the globalist are rewriting the entire
[49:59.200 --> 50:04.000]  genetic programming of the earth right now this is a genetic dictatorship it's
[50:04.000 --> 50:08.160]  being established and all that matters is that we beat these people they are
[50:08.160 --> 50:14.520]  vandals they are psychopaths beauty to them is destruction and ashes and burn
[50:14.520 --> 50:25.880]  cities and deformity and sickness hell is being released and you look back at
[50:25.880 --> 50:31.360]  our ancestors and all the struggles they went through and all of the women who
[50:31.360 --> 50:35.960]  went through childbirth and all of our ancestors that fought and died to
[50:35.960 --> 50:41.400]  protect our tribes and our people and all of the struggles it's always been a
[50:41.400 --> 50:44.720]  struggle against good and evil against the true human spirit and the dark
[50:44.720 --> 50:50.000]  psychopathic minority that always seeks after power we must meet them on the
[50:50.000 --> 50:55.160]  field of intellectual economic and spiritual and philosophical battle and

[54:20.960 --> 54:24.080]  let's go ahead and go back to your calls
[54:24.080 --> 54:34.360]  I wanted to thank you for educating me and people that I'm sending your
[54:34.360 --> 54:38.400]  information to I think you're a real hero and you have a lot of courage and
[54:38.400 --> 54:43.520]  people should appreciate it and I think enough people do so I have a couple
[54:43.520 --> 54:49.440]  things I want to tell you I have sort of an unconventional idea of the world I
[54:49.440 --> 54:54.240]  really I really don't believe that we're in a fight against good and evil I
[54:54.240 --> 54:59.560]  think it's more intelligence and stupidity and I don't think we've ever
[54:59.560 --> 55:06.160]  been ruled by any intelligent life down here and I think when you say that
[55:06.160 --> 55:10.600]  somebody's evil that's sort of giving them a compliment well Marissa there's a
[55:10.600 --> 55:14.640]  lot of ignorant people that serve this system through ignorance I agree with
[55:14.640 --> 55:18.560]  you there but I have read literally hundreds and hundreds of globalist
[55:18.560 --> 55:22.720]  white papers we've posted them on the websites we've read from them here on
[55:22.720 --> 55:27.720]  air this is an organized program but we're facing this is extremely
[55:27.720 --> 55:34.920]  organized and is a intelligence that if anything is beyond human and is the old
[55:34.920 --> 55:40.960]  devil okay I believe that there's such a thing as evil and good but I also believe
[55:40.960 --> 55:47.000]  that human beings have trouble facing what they are which is very unevolved
[55:47.000 --> 55:53.000]  and stupid which is kind of like we have never really been controlled humans are
[55:53.000 --> 55:57.560]  multifaceted though there's the worst and the best in us yeah but if we were
[55:57.560 --> 56:02.240]  really intelligent we wouldn't have wars continually we wouldn't have people
[56:02.240 --> 56:06.360]  without weak but ma'am ma'am the globalist orchestrate those wars to
[56:06.360 --> 56:11.600]  consolidate power these are well planned out these aren't and people and at the
[56:11.600 --> 56:15.720]  bottom line is you're constantly of it sort of complimenting these people like
[56:15.720 --> 56:21.880]  they are dumbing us down they're so below the average person these people are
[56:21.880 --> 56:26.760]  way below you and myself intelligence wise I don't care if they go to Harvard
[56:26.760 --> 56:31.240]  I don't care if they're in Yale they are way below average and they are they're
[56:31.240 --> 56:35.840]  wanting they're threatened by intelligent people very threatened because I mean
[56:35.840 --> 56:39.360]  they are but I'm saying they're conscious in what they're doing they I
[56:39.360 --> 56:43.200]  agree that it's a mind trick they believe they're smart because they're so cold
[56:43.200 --> 56:46.800]  blooded they believe that's a strength when really it's a weakness so I agree
[56:46.800 --> 56:52.640]  with you on that point and they're destroying human society and I do believe
[56:52.640 --> 56:56.840]  the elite are delusional allowing all this open-air cross species genetic
[56:56.840 --> 57:04.880]  engineering because it threatens their planet and our planet but I have read
[57:04.880 --> 57:08.880]  their writings and let me tell you they're smart no I don't agree with that
[57:08.880 --> 57:13.080]  I'm sorry you're a great guy I really believe they have damaged DNA and they are
[57:13.080 --> 57:18.000]  destroying their own genetics I doubt they're people who are very educated in
[57:18.000 --> 57:22.560]  nutrition I doubt they're eating properly and they're in breads and I think
[57:22.560 --> 57:27.880]  they have damaged DNA and our society with you this the elites worldwide have
[57:27.880 --> 57:31.640]  interbred with other elites who tend to be cunning manipulative ruthless
[57:31.640 --> 57:36.440]  sadistic psychopathic and so we are dealing with whether they be Chinese or
[57:36.440 --> 57:40.640]  Jewish or European German whatever they're basically these elites are all
[57:40.640 --> 57:44.960]  the same and that they're ruthless but I appreciate I appreciate your call man
[57:44.960 --> 57:48.400]  we're gonna go to break and come back and take a few more calls and a day

[01:00:57.800 --> 01:01:03.240]  all coming up but right now Leah in Kentucky you're on the air welcome hi
[01:01:03.240 --> 01:01:09.000]  Alex thank you I just wanted to compliment you first of all on your
[01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:15.960]  excellent breakdown of the playbook from the economic hitman in your emergency
[01:01:15.960 --> 01:01:21.440]  method I think this is vital to people's understanding I know when I try to wake
[01:01:21.440 --> 01:01:27.680]  people up two of the disconnects that I find are one well the economy is just
[01:01:27.680 --> 01:01:33.200]  not doing well now but you know that happens and with that disconnect what
[01:01:33.200 --> 01:01:37.880]  they need to understand is that it is being destroyed by design the second
[01:01:37.880 --> 01:01:44.240]  thing they could be missing is that when an economy is destroyed by design it's
[01:01:44.240 --> 01:01:50.440]  a very very bad sign for that group of people being destroyed and I think a
[01:01:50.440 --> 01:01:55.680]  good example of this is what happened in some cases to Native Americans you take
[01:01:55.680 --> 01:02:01.240]  control of their economy corral them and they're at your mercy and you
[01:02:01.240 --> 01:02:07.160]  actually the Soviets Stalin and Hitler both wrote and said they were using with
[01:02:07.160 --> 01:02:11.720]  their work camps with their gulags with their concentration camps the model that
[01:02:11.720 --> 01:02:17.200]  was used first by the British in the New World and then by the US Army in the
[01:02:17.200 --> 01:02:22.880]  1850s 6070s 80s 90s and you take them you reeducate them you cut them off from
[01:02:22.880 --> 01:02:26.800]  resources you put them on reservations and then you basically incrementally
[01:02:26.800 --> 01:02:31.480]  wipe them out and that's what's being done to everyone now and that is the IMF
[01:02:31.480 --> 01:02:36.640]  World Bank model economically that is what Maury strong and the UN say that's
[01:02:36.640 --> 01:02:41.560]  what the carbon tax is it is meant to destroy industrial societies to render
[01:02:41.560 --> 01:02:47.480]  us weak and I mean you know here's Time Magazine the only child myth and I knew
[01:02:47.480 --> 01:02:52.600]  when I saw this before I got it off the newsstand I knew what it would say when
[01:02:52.600 --> 01:02:56.200]  I opened up the article and it says the economy is bad the answer is don't have
[01:02:56.200 --> 01:03:00.240]  more than one child it's better for your carbon footprint to only you know have
[01:03:00.240 --> 01:03:04.960]  one or no children this is all being pushed everywhere they don't the
[01:03:04.960 --> 01:03:09.280]  globalist have gotten the world through fraud now they don't want to enslave us
[01:03:09.280 --> 01:03:13.320]  they want to enslave us so they can then kill us and people better get the
[01:03:13.320 --> 01:03:18.240]  magnitude of this through their brains exactly exactly so I had an idea of a
[01:03:18.240 --> 01:03:22.880]  call to action I know a lot of us are missing that fourth hour we enjoy
[01:03:22.880 --> 01:03:26.960]  listening to you but we understand you have very important things to do I think
[01:03:26.960 --> 01:03:31.400]  people who who have discernment who have wisdom have understanding have seen
[01:03:31.400 --> 01:03:35.880]  what's been going on should take that fourth hour now and research positive
[01:03:35.880 --> 01:03:40.360]  peaceful and corrective steps that they can take use that fourth hour start
[01:03:40.360 --> 01:03:45.160]  today listen I agree with you but but also you heard the earlier caller talk
[01:03:45.160 --> 01:03:48.800]  about how he's gotten together with his neighbors and they're having meetings
[01:03:48.800 --> 01:03:52.800]  every week about what they're going to do during this collapse nothing is more
[01:03:52.800 --> 01:03:57.080]  valuable than friends and family you can count on and knowing something's coming
[01:03:57.080 --> 01:04:01.600]  before it fully arrives now we're already into it but we've only sunk a
[01:04:01.600 --> 01:04:04.920]  little bit into this and we again if we point out the globalist have
[01:04:04.920 --> 01:04:08.880]  engineered this they will have to back off and put the brakes on it but if they
[01:04:08.880 --> 01:04:12.840]  think they can get away with creating the crisis and getting more power out of
[01:04:12.840 --> 01:04:16.880]  it they're going to accelerate it as Thomas Jefferson said the level of
[01:04:16.880 --> 01:04:22.560]  tyranny you will live under is the exact point that you start resisting the
[01:04:22.560 --> 01:04:27.440]  sky's the limit with these people absolutely thank you so much Alex we

[01:08:29.080 --> 01:08:34.040]  zero hedge US paid Iranian nuclear scientist five million for aid to CIA
[01:08:34.040 --> 01:08:40.200]  officials said Washington time that's just some of what is coming up also cap
[01:08:40.200 --> 01:08:46.320]  and trade bill will be added to the Senate climate change bill so they're
[01:08:46.320 --> 01:08:51.000]  moving ahead with that they're on the verge of passing a federal reserve
[01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:58.160]  takeover the United States that dwarfs the beachhead they got in 1913 97 years
[01:08:58.160 --> 01:09:03.440]  ago Justice Department says they're not going to sue the 800 plus sanctuary
[01:09:03.440 --> 01:09:07.040]  cities where illegal aliens are above the law that's okay that they won't work
[01:09:07.040 --> 01:09:09.440]  with the feds because the feds don't want them to but they are going to
[01:09:09.440 --> 01:09:14.080]  continue suing Arizona also BP's reporting they've fixed the leak let me
[01:09:14.080 --> 01:09:18.800]  cover that now that we're going to Paul Watson BP leak fixed USA today reports
[01:09:18.800 --> 01:09:25.800]  golf well test to begin soon they claim that oil is now stopped now they've said
[01:09:25.800 --> 01:09:30.080]  this three times that I can remember you probably remember more BP plans to move
[01:09:30.080 --> 01:09:34.000]  forward soon on a critical and repeated the lead delayed test of its golf well
[01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:39.280]  after fixing a leak on the new cap design to contain the gushing oil so I
[01:09:39.280 --> 01:09:42.560]  guess they're spinning it's not a complete cap we sure wish that would be
[01:09:42.560 --> 01:09:46.040]  the case the test of the Wells pressure could begin later in the day BP senior
[01:09:46.040 --> 01:09:50.280]  vice president Kent Wells told reporters Thursday during a morning technical
[01:09:50.280 --> 01:09:54.040]  briefing we're going to keep moving forward with this well said adding that
[01:09:54.040 --> 01:09:59.520]  the leak came as a surprise we are always prepared for it but I would say we
[01:09:59.520 --> 01:10:05.600]  didn't expect it so we'll see if that really is a capping of it or just more
[01:10:05.600 --> 01:10:10.160]  spin in fact guys will you pull up the web live webcam of it and see if it's
[01:10:10.160 --> 01:10:14.840]  leaking I mean they've lied so many times who even knows what that means oh
[01:10:14.840 --> 01:10:20.640]  also on the BP oil leak situation what is it day 85 86 now government expert
[01:10:20.640 --> 01:10:24.440]  witness over 42 million gallons not a million and a half but 42 million
[01:10:24.440 --> 01:10:30.800]  gallons of dispersant used during BP oil disaster much more toxic than the crude
[01:10:30.800 --> 01:10:37.160]  oil itself but for the balance of the hour Paul Joseph Watson who of course
[01:10:37.160 --> 01:10:41.600]  works with the info wars.com prison planet.com team he is the editor of
[01:10:41.600 --> 01:10:47.360]  prison planet.com and my second largest site course info wars.com is the main
[01:10:47.360 --> 01:10:51.080]  flagship and the sites continue to reach more and more people every day because
[01:10:51.080 --> 01:10:55.240]  of all of you spreading the word about the important news and analysis posted
[01:10:55.240 --> 01:10:59.040]  and linked there on the sites each and every day I wanted to go over this with
[01:10:59.040 --> 01:11:04.520]  Watson America stands on the precipice of total collapse his latest article and
[01:11:04.520 --> 01:11:09.880]  as a key video posted at the bottom of it titled road warrior level collapse
[01:11:09.880 --> 01:11:15.400]  imminent if we don't take corrective action now as they announce laying off
[01:11:15.400 --> 01:11:18.400]  government people at the state and local level laying off more than half of
[01:11:18.400 --> 01:11:21.480]  major police departments and sheriff's departments police not responding to
[01:11:21.480 --> 01:11:27.120]  major crime the feds blocking any type of rescue of Arizona that is all coming
[01:11:27.120 --> 01:11:32.040]  out mass foreclosures this year expected to eclipse oh nine levels world at risk
[01:11:32.040 --> 01:11:37.760]  of folding in on itself CNBC reports so that's just some of what we're going to
[01:11:37.760 --> 01:11:43.200]  be discussing and then also this Financial Times of London article from
[01:11:43.200 --> 01:11:48.160]  two days ago we can't stress how important this is Obama faces growing
[01:11:48.160 --> 01:11:51.760]  credibility crisis and it goes on to say the bottom line here Robert Shapiro
[01:11:51.760 --> 01:11:56.080]  top Clinton advisor said is it Americans don't believe in President Obama's
[01:11:56.080 --> 01:12:01.600]  leadership says Robert Shapiro he says he has to find some way between now
[01:12:01.600 --> 01:12:07.880]  November of demonstrating that he is a leader who can command confidence short
[01:12:07.880 --> 01:12:11.400]  of a 9-11 event or Oklahoma City bombing I can't think of how he could do
[01:12:11.400 --> 01:12:17.040]  just that and Watson wrote a detailed article breaking down all the past
[01:12:17.040 --> 01:12:21.160]  statements of people in government talking about how they want more giant
[01:12:21.160 --> 01:12:25.000]  terror attacks they have the motive for it and you'll research each event they're
[01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:29.840]  behind it but going to poll Watson now poll you want to get in to the economic
[01:12:29.840 --> 01:12:33.360]  collapse first and the fact that they're now admitting depression and what we do
[01:12:33.360 --> 01:12:37.640]  about that or do you want to get into the top Clinton official only a terror
[01:12:37.640 --> 01:12:44.200]  attack and save Obama hello Alex good to be back yeah I think if we get into the
[01:12:44.200 --> 01:12:49.640]  economic collapse information first I mean they both kind of tie into each
[01:12:49.640 --> 01:12:57.080]  other but it's not just Alex Jones or me or you know Salente or Peter Schiff
[01:12:57.080 --> 01:13:04.040]  saying this that there will be a collapse within the next two years it's the
[01:13:04.040 --> 01:13:08.240]  insiders themselves it's the elitist yeah that's the form's headline time to
[01:13:08.240 --> 01:13:12.360]  get out of the dollar they just like they signaled time to implode the housing
[01:13:12.360 --> 01:13:15.480]  market when they had built the bubble saying it would never end I saw them
[01:13:15.480 --> 01:13:22.680]  signaling that in 2007 into eight warned people now they're signaling again yeah
[01:13:22.680 --> 01:13:27.360]  and I mean this is not just coming from us it's coming from people like Nile
[01:13:27.360 --> 01:13:33.320]  Ferguson who is you know the big Harvard history professor economics professor
[01:13:33.320 --> 01:13:38.440]  and he's a member of both the Bilderberg group you went to the last two
[01:13:38.440 --> 01:13:42.560]  meetings and also the Aspen Institute and he's saying the biggest collapse what
[01:13:42.560 --> 01:13:49.480]  since 16 or since 1730 basically hey so he's saying a sudden and total collapse
[01:13:49.480 --> 01:13:54.560]  within two years he said it's gonna be rapid it's gonna happen quickly it's
[01:13:54.560 --> 01:14:00.080]  not gonna linger on and that it's gonna be a Greek style meltdown but on a much
[01:14:00.080 --> 01:14:04.560]  bigger scale because of course you know America stands to lose much more than
[01:14:04.560 --> 01:14:09.840]  Greece because many more people are gonna be caught up in this kind of chaos
[01:14:09.840 --> 01:14:17.480]  and the Chinese have now downgraded European and US T bills yeah it's all
[01:14:17.480 --> 01:14:20.920]  coming to a head now we're being told that you know we've got to accept this
[01:14:20.920 --> 01:14:26.880]  age of austerity the financial terrorists that caused the collapse that
[01:14:26.880 --> 01:14:31.440]  stole trillions of dollars that were given to him by our governments now
[01:14:31.440 --> 01:14:37.120]  saying that you know we're gonna have to make up the shortfall by sacrificing
[01:14:37.120 --> 01:14:43.280]  public services paying more taxes our incomes are gonna be capped VAT in the
[01:14:43.280 --> 01:14:51.360]  UK is gonna go up to 20% from January 2011 that's the sales tax you pay 20%
[01:14:51.360 --> 01:14:59.920]  tax on most purchases Obama and Volcker have said that sales tax of VAT tax for
[01:14:59.920 --> 01:15:04.280]  America is still on the table and raise the social security retirement age to 70
[01:15:04.280 --> 01:15:08.760]  and take part of people's pension funds bare minimum it's all being announced
[01:15:08.760 --> 01:15:14.760]  yeah I mean that's what the age of austerity is but the thing that goals
[01:15:14.760 --> 01:15:20.880]  me about it is the fact that last time this happened certainly in Britain was
[01:15:20.880 --> 01:15:26.560]  in the late 70s when we had the three-day week which was followed by these
[01:15:26.560 --> 01:15:32.120]  austerity measures the three-day week came as a result of miners going on
[01:15:32.120 --> 01:15:37.280]  strike and we had to conserve electricity so the the working week was
[01:15:37.280 --> 01:15:41.160]  shortened to three days and this is exactly what's coming in again with this
[01:15:41.160 --> 01:15:46.680]  post-industrial revolution this green economy but in the 70s which is you know
[01:15:46.680 --> 01:15:50.320]  people saying that this economic meltdowns worse than it was in the 70s
[01:15:50.320 --> 01:15:55.520]  now but we had these austerity measures very similar to what's coming in now
[01:15:55.520 --> 01:16:04.040]  and public spending was cut by a mere 4% and as a result of that 4% cut in
[01:16:04.040 --> 01:16:11.360]  public services in Britain at the time basically there were widespread strikes
[01:16:11.360 --> 01:16:16.720]  there were riots there were bodies left unburied and at the time the German
[01:16:16.720 --> 01:16:21.760]  Chancellor said that as a result of this quote Britain that was no longer a
[01:16:21.760 --> 01:16:28.760]  developed country that all came as a result of 4% cut in public spending so
[01:16:28.760 --> 01:16:34.680]  now they're saying that it's going to be 20% plus cuts in public spending so what
[01:16:34.680 --> 01:16:38.320]  we're going to experience in the next few years is going to be four times worse
[01:16:38.320 --> 01:16:43.280]  than anything that happened in the 70s and to be clear when they talk about 20
[01:16:43.280 --> 01:16:47.840]  percent cuts in public spending they're going to increase taxes so there'll be
[01:16:47.840 --> 01:16:52.640]  more money overall but it's all going to go to the offshore banks and the
[01:16:52.640 --> 01:16:56.440]  increased taxes will destroy what's left of the real economy we were told in the
[01:16:56.440 --> 01:17:00.560]  90s NAFTA and GATT would be Valhalla but internally the UN and others said it
[01:17:00.560 --> 01:17:05.840]  was designed to deindustrialize us and then to rise up China as the new global
[01:17:05.840 --> 01:17:09.920]  system and now we see the Council on Foreign Relations and the New York Times
[01:17:09.920 --> 01:17:14.560]  and others saying China will save us China is the new model meanwhile they're
[01:17:14.560 --> 01:17:18.160]  announcing in China in the Associated Press as if it's a good thing that they
[01:17:18.160 --> 01:17:22.160]  lock everyone down at night inside their homes and you're not allowed out on the
[01:17:22.160 --> 01:17:27.520]  streets at night so this is the globalist model total control yeah and
[01:17:27.520 --> 01:17:31.280]  that's that's what Joe Liebham and wants the internet to be like the Chinese
[01:17:31.280 --> 01:17:35.920]  internet as well so China is the model for what they're moving towards and part
[01:17:35.920 --> 01:17:41.080]  of it's going to come with this austerity fascism I wrote an article last month
[01:17:41.080 --> 01:17:46.080]  called austerity fascism is coming and it will be brutal and I go through all the
[01:17:46.080 --> 01:17:52.480]  measures that they will introduce to move towards these austerity measures and
[01:17:52.480 --> 01:18:00.000]  these public cuts income tax raises you know caps on income and to think that
[01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:04.960]  people basically a lot of them nearly went over the edge as a result of 4%
[01:18:04.960 --> 01:18:09.720]  cuts and now they're talking about 20 plus people's survival mechanisms are
[01:18:09.720 --> 01:18:14.320]  basically going to be on a hair trigger and that's why we go back to the 2007
[01:18:14.320 --> 01:18:18.600]  British Ministry of Defense report where they said by 2012 total collapse in
[01:18:18.600 --> 01:18:24.040]  martial law because this is being orchestrated yeah and people aren't used
[01:18:24.040 --> 01:18:29.520]  to it you know people go along in their lives worshipping LeBron James and
[01:18:29.520 --> 01:18:33.160]  everyone and they think that the world around them is just going to stay the
[01:18:33.160 --> 01:18:36.840]  same forever if they're not involved in it and if they just stick their head in
[01:18:36.840 --> 01:18:41.720]  the ground but once these austerity measures start to impact them directly
[01:18:41.720 --> 01:18:46.760]  you know and their pay gets capped they lose their jobs their welfare gets
[01:18:46.760 --> 01:18:51.760]  cut in half then we're certainly going to bit see you know how thin the veneer
[01:18:51.760 --> 01:18:56.160]  of civilization is because these people are not going to like what's happening
[01:18:56.160 --> 01:19:00.480]  to them and it's partly their own fault because you know they've they've sold
[01:19:00.480 --> 01:19:05.680]  themselves to the to the couch potato lifestyle and the giant whore of lazy
[01:19:05.680 --> 01:19:09.560]  dumb-down people are going to be used as a weapon by the government and the
[01:19:09.560 --> 01:19:13.880]  corporations against the producers and they're going to use this wave of panic
[01:19:13.880 --> 01:19:19.680]  to fully rob anyone who's actually done well in life exactly and it's going to
[01:19:19.680 --> 01:19:25.000]  be class warfare if people are prepared for this and they've got reserves of you
[01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:28.880]  know gold and food and whatever and they've got land and they've got places
[01:19:28.880 --> 01:19:33.960]  to go and they can get through this then the people who haven't prepared for it
[01:19:33.960 --> 01:19:37.840]  are going to be insane with jealousy and it's going to create class warfare and
[01:19:37.840 --> 01:19:41.760]  the ultra elite are going to point the giant horde against the tiny middle
[01:19:41.760 --> 01:19:46.560]  class and wipe it out as they did in Nigeria Argentina South Africa and
[01:19:46.560 --> 01:19:50.240]  countless other nations we know this is an orchestrated plan we have the IMF
[01:19:50.240 --> 01:19:53.680]  World Bank documents Paul stay there let's come back and talk about time
[01:19:53.680 --> 01:19:57.680]  frames for the collapse and how we try to averted then we'll get into the attack

[01:24:06.760 --> 01:24:12.080]  back to Paul Watson Paul yeah mainstream news is saying the next year or two
[01:24:12.080 --> 01:24:15.560]  depression but all the economic numbers show at least three years we've been in
[01:24:15.560 --> 01:24:20.320]  a deep recession going into depression now they're announcing it there they're
[01:24:20.320 --> 01:24:25.360]  now trying to form this new global SDR system you know Salente says by the end
[01:24:25.360 --> 01:24:31.360]  of this year will be in a total collapse I I hope that's not the case but when
[01:24:31.360 --> 01:24:34.240]  Schwarzenegger is already telling state employees they're gonna get minimum
[01:24:34.240 --> 01:24:37.480]  wage and police departments coast to coast or laying people off saying they
[01:24:37.480 --> 01:24:42.440]  won't respond to crime but taxes are going up I mean this is amazing what's
[01:24:42.440 --> 01:24:48.600]  your take on the collapse well certainly that they're infuriated about the
[01:24:48.600 --> 01:24:53.040]  fact that all these anti incumbent candidates are threatening the
[01:24:53.040 --> 01:24:58.400]  establishment members people like Harry Reid you know his opponent the Tea
[01:24:58.400 --> 01:25:03.000]  Party member has been completely lambasted by the mainstream media
[01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:07.880]  because she supports the oath keepers she supports getting the fluoride out of
[01:25:07.880 --> 01:25:12.000]  the water but those people those kind of people are really starting to challenge
[01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:18.280]  the establishment minions so that's November that's what you know four months
[01:25:18.280 --> 01:25:23.920]  away from now so that's really gonna be a big flashpoint I think but certainly
[01:25:23.920 --> 01:25:29.120]  within two years it's gonna it's gonna start to unwind it already is as he
[01:25:29.120 --> 01:25:33.800]  said what freaks me out about the whole thing is you know the people who would
[01:25:33.800 --> 01:25:39.600]  normally be deriding us as paranoid alarmists the big establishment media
[01:25:39.600 --> 01:25:44.320]  people are saying exactly the same thing and in fact that some of them are even
[01:25:44.320 --> 01:25:50.280]  going further than we are for example there's a guy called Simon Sharma who
[01:25:50.280 --> 01:25:55.360]  is the most recognized historian in Britain you know he presents all the
[01:25:55.360 --> 01:26:01.440]  BBC and History Channel documentaries all the new ones that come out and again
[01:26:01.440 --> 01:26:04.920]  this is in the Financial Times that's what that's where they announce all this
[01:26:04.920 --> 01:26:08.520]  because it's a Bilderberg owned paper they know the vast majority of the
[01:26:08.520 --> 01:26:13.080]  serfs are looking at the topless women on page three of the Sun and you know
[01:26:13.080 --> 01:26:17.600]  all this kind of stuff so people don't read those newspapers but the insiders
[01:26:17.600 --> 01:26:24.320]  the elitists do and Sharma this historian wrote that not only will there be a
[01:26:24.320 --> 01:26:30.320]  collapse and a economic collapse civil unrest you know mass riots but there's
[01:26:30.320 --> 01:26:35.040]  also the very real prospect of a revolution and he's talking about in
[01:26:35.040 --> 01:26:40.200]  America because the elite might allow the chaos to get completely out of hand
[01:26:40.200 --> 01:26:45.440]  and allow people to get a foot in the door on actually wrestling back
[01:26:45.440 --> 01:26:50.440]  controlled the system and this is a guy who's intimately tied into the
[01:26:50.440 --> 01:26:54.600]  establishment that's the same things that big number since he said two months
[01:26:54.600 --> 01:27:00.680]  ago yeah so in a sense they're going even further than us in saying that not
[01:27:00.680 --> 01:27:05.880]  only is there going to be mass unrest and riots and a collapse but they may it
[01:27:05.880 --> 01:27:12.360]  may even lead to a complete kind of coup d'etat on behalf of the people well
[01:27:12.360 --> 01:27:17.000]  that's the big issue is that either the globalists get unbelievable expansions
[01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:21.120]  of power out of the crisis they've engineered or we use it to restore the
[01:27:21.120 --> 01:27:24.480]  republic and restore free nations worldwide and they're going to win in
[01:27:24.480 --> 01:27:28.040]  some nations we're going to lose in some nations we're going to win in some
[01:27:28.040 --> 01:27:36.960]  nations but the fight is on yeah and I mean Sharma said that this is his quote
[01:27:36.960 --> 01:27:42.720]  that the American people could quote bring down the governance of the American
[01:27:42.720 --> 01:27:47.080]  Republic he's talking about the people overthrowing the government and this is
[01:27:47.080 --> 01:27:53.120]  a this is a massively respected historian but the key thing is he says
[01:27:53.120 --> 01:27:56.760]  that the only way that the elite will prevent this from happening if they allow
[01:27:56.760 --> 01:28:01.880]  the crisis the unrest to get out of hand is by Obama becoming basically a
[01:28:01.880 --> 01:28:07.680]  dictator an authoritarian enforcer and we know how he's gonna do that which ties
[01:28:07.680 --> 01:28:12.840]  into the Shapiro quote out of the Financial Times just a couple of days
[01:28:12.840 --> 01:28:17.960]  we're gonna cover that in a moment but look at not just Woody Allen and all
[01:28:17.960 --> 01:28:23.760]  these other people calling for Obama to be a dictator we have the system itself
[01:28:23.760 --> 01:28:26.920]  and we have the Financial Times of London a year and a half ago with the
[01:28:26.920 --> 01:28:31.260]  headline and now for world government with the head editor for their
[01:28:31.260 --> 01:28:34.600]  international affairs who's been a Bilderberg attendee saying yes it's
[01:28:34.600 --> 01:28:38.840]  authoritarian yes it's been secret but it's for your own good so they're now
[01:28:38.840 --> 01:28:45.040]  coming out saying tyranny is good they're not even denying it now no and
[01:28:45.040 --> 01:28:49.680]  it's also coming from the left wing with the climate change movement saying we
[01:28:49.680 --> 01:28:53.560]  need we need dictators to save the environment we need to see the end of
[01:28:53.560 --> 01:28:58.400]  democracy if the earth is to survive global warming so it's coming from
[01:28:58.400 --> 01:29:03.400]  every side and if they are to ram through the the majority of what they
[01:29:03.400 --> 01:29:08.800]  want in this anemic post-industrial revolution then yeah they're gonna
[01:29:08.800 --> 01:29:12.480]  they're gonna have to get hardcore they're gonna have to get brutal I mean
[01:29:12.480 --> 01:29:17.640]  as I was talking about before when we last had this austerity fascism in the
[01:29:17.640 --> 01:29:23.840]  United Kingdom the top bracket of income tax was 98 percent anyone earning
[01:29:23.840 --> 01:29:28.680]  over 20,000 pounds a year had to pay 98 percent of that top bracket to the
[01:29:28.680 --> 01:29:31.880]  government they're not gonna get that through without some fascism along the
[01:29:31.880 --> 01:29:37.560]  way stay there Watson we're gonna talk more about this when we get back on the
[01:29:37.560 --> 01:29:41.040]  type of terror attacks they may be planning to stage now why would ultra
[01:29:41.040 --> 01:29:45.800]  rich want a 90 plus percent tax bracket because they're offshore they take
[01:29:45.800 --> 01:29:49.600]  your money domestically ship it offshore
[01:29:50.200 --> 01:29:59.720]  we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network

[01:37:16.840 --> 01:37:21.480]  official only a terror attack and save obama again in the true paper of record
[01:37:21.480 --> 01:37:25.040]  where the globalists speak where the builder birds own the paper they are
[01:37:25.040 --> 01:37:29.000]  saying this is a paper for them to communicate with each other that obama
[01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:34.160]  needs an oklahoma city or a 9-11 and if he can't have one of those so he can
[01:37:34.160 --> 01:37:39.160]  rally as a strong leader then he is going to be destroyed shapiro said this
[01:37:39.160 --> 01:37:43.000]  is chilling information but remember going back a year ago and accelerating
[01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:47.480]  the last three or four months I've been saying I could see them in all these
[01:37:47.480 --> 01:37:53.520]  HBO and MSNBC and CNN documentaries and an ADL report southern prairie law
[01:37:53.520 --> 01:37:58.120]  center pentagon reports my act reports homeland security law enforcement
[01:37:58.120 --> 01:38:02.840]  brainwashing reports propaganda reports saying gun owners libertarians
[01:38:02.840 --> 01:38:06.880]  conservatives tea partiers in the fetters ron paul supporters alex jones
[01:38:06.880 --> 01:38:10.880]  supporters they want to kill cops they want to blow up buildings turns out the
[01:38:10.880 --> 01:38:15.160]  hitari was totally fake like we told you eight months before they got busted I
[01:38:15.160 --> 01:38:19.000]  could see them being set up I said that on air out of 400 plus militias I
[01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:22.880]  identified them as being infiltrated turned out that was the case but it
[01:38:22.880 --> 01:38:25.280]  turned out it was the feds that were basically shooting their mouths off so
[01:38:25.280 --> 01:38:29.240]  that was a setup they are clearly getting ready to stage terror attacks to be
[01:38:29.240 --> 01:38:33.120]  blamed on the American people and terror attacks to be blamed on Iran and a
[01:38:33.120 --> 01:38:37.520]  cyber attack is an excuse to take over the web and of course now we have the
[01:38:37.520 --> 01:38:41.840]  economist chief economist of the world bank excuse me IMF telling the korea
[01:38:41.840 --> 01:38:45.880]  times that yes they're going to use the oil spill for a carbon tax you can see
[01:38:45.880 --> 01:38:51.520]  their methodology of problem reaction solution and using crises at work here
[01:38:51.520 --> 01:38:57.120]  like never before and then they're so transparent Watson break it down well
[01:38:57.120 --> 01:39:02.120]  it's almost a mirror image of the situation in the mid 90s with Clinton
[01:39:02.120 --> 01:39:08.440]  I mean Clinton didn't have much higher approval ratings in early 95 than Obama
[01:39:08.440 --> 01:39:12.800]  does now he was a little bit higher but of course as soon as the Oklahoma City
[01:39:12.800 --> 01:39:18.160]  bombing happened which was of course completely run by the FBI through their
[01:39:18.160 --> 01:39:24.600]  stooge their patsy Timothy McVey now that's completely out in the open Clinton
[01:39:24.600 --> 01:39:30.640]  went up to back around 60% and this this conservative revolution as it was at
[01:39:30.640 --> 01:39:34.960]  the time that threatened the power monopoly was completely crushed and
[01:39:34.960 --> 01:39:39.520]  they were able to demonize their political opposition as right-wing fringe
[01:39:39.520 --> 01:39:43.760]  extremists who should be completely ignored and that's what we see happening
[01:39:43.760 --> 01:39:50.400]  again today Sharon angle as I mentioned before this challenger to the Senate
[01:39:50.400 --> 01:39:55.320]  Democrat Harry Reid has got a good chance of beating him which is why the
[01:39:55.320 --> 01:39:59.560]  established media is out in force saying that she's a right-wing extremist just
[01:39:59.560 --> 01:40:05.200]  because she supports people upholding their oath to the Constitution and wants
[01:40:05.200 --> 01:40:11.480]  to get the deadly neurotoxin sodium fluoride out of the water so with people
[01:40:11.480 --> 01:40:15.960]  like that really having a chance of wrestling back some of the power from
[01:40:15.960 --> 01:40:21.120]  the establishment in Washington DC they need some kind of event which they can
[01:40:21.120 --> 01:40:25.880]  exploit to demonize their political opposition and when you've got people
[01:40:25.880 --> 01:40:32.920]  like Rahm Emanuel being the chief string puller for Obama who is a complete
[01:40:32.920 --> 01:40:36.840]  puppet and merely reads off a teleprompter the real power in that
[01:40:36.840 --> 01:40:43.320]  administration is certainly with Rahm Emanuel to a point and he's he's a son
[01:40:43.320 --> 01:40:48.640]  of an Israeli terrorist who planned the bombings of hotels and marketplaces he
[01:40:48.640 --> 01:40:53.840]  was in the Ergun terrorist group that killed hundreds of people so when you've
[01:40:53.840 --> 01:40:59.080]  got people like that advising Obama and you know never let a good crisis go to
[01:40:59.080 --> 01:41:03.600]  waste and then you read in the Financial Times that this big Obama
[01:41:03.600 --> 01:41:08.160]  supporter Shapiro is saying that basically we need a terror attack otherwise
[01:41:08.160 --> 01:41:13.800]  Obama's finished then I think we should be a little bit concerned about it well
[01:41:13.800 --> 01:41:18.040]  you can see the preparatory brainwashing so people think the mainstream media boy
[01:41:18.040 --> 01:41:21.960]  they're really on target the right-wingers did blow up a federal building darn
[01:41:21.960 --> 01:41:27.080]  them we've got to get their guns my gosh I also see an attempted assassination
[01:41:27.080 --> 01:41:30.720]  God forbid we're against and we're totally against that happening against
[01:41:30.720 --> 01:41:35.400]  Barack Obama as a caller said last Sunday the question is will Obama be
[01:41:35.400 --> 01:41:41.320]  taken out by impeachment or embalment and we hope that he is not taken out by
[01:41:41.320 --> 01:41:46.720]  embalment we want Obama a teleprompter reading CIA agent for Indonesia to
[01:41:46.720 --> 01:41:51.600]  certainly live a long life we don't want that puppet to be turned into a
[01:41:51.600 --> 01:41:55.400]  martyr you know the same reason the globalists don't want to kill me is
[01:41:55.400 --> 01:41:58.840]  because they don't want to turn me into a martyr against their tyranny we don't
[01:41:58.840 --> 01:42:04.480]  want the globalists to turn Obama or any of his criminal scallywags into some
[01:42:04.480 --> 01:42:10.680]  type of martyr as well no but it would be very easy for them to do that if you
[01:42:10.680 --> 01:42:16.800]  look into exactly how how much of a vacuous puppet Obama is how much of a
[01:42:16.800 --> 01:42:21.520]  front man he is it's transparent to see that he's just a water carrier for the
[01:42:21.520 --> 01:42:25.120]  elite for the elite and he could be replaced at any moment you know his
[01:42:25.120 --> 01:42:30.120]  his speeches are written by Bilderberg members his book was written by Bill
[01:42:30.120 --> 01:42:34.760]  Ayres the domestic terrorist weather underground bomber you know everything
[01:42:34.760 --> 01:42:39.560]  he does is coordinated by somebody else standing behind the scenes so I mean
[01:42:39.560 --> 01:42:43.680]  they could easily run a false flag against Obama well it was declassified
[01:42:43.680 --> 01:42:48.640]  last year that Patty Hearst you're going in with machine guns provocatively
[01:42:48.640 --> 01:42:52.800]  and shooting it on 18 millimeter film that was all directed by the FBI and
[01:42:52.800 --> 01:42:59.240]  was staged that's now been declassified yeah so they've always got that tool I
[01:42:59.240 --> 01:43:04.800]  mean to a large extent it's been discredited and eviscerated by the fact
[01:43:04.800 --> 01:43:11.600]  that it's been so voluminously and repeatedly exposed since 9-11 but what
[01:43:11.600 --> 01:43:15.920]  I see happening is that they'll just let Obama wither and die and they'll get a
[01:43:15.920 --> 01:43:20.520]  Mitt Romney in and then we'll really see you know the fascism come into play
[01:43:20.520 --> 01:43:25.160]  especially with regards to the economy and I think they'll just play it that
[01:43:25.160 --> 01:43:29.960]  way because you you've still got a massive brainwashed right wingers who
[01:43:29.960 --> 01:43:35.000]  will just think that a Republican is the answer again the Tea Party's largely
[01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:41.360]  being taken over by these people there are candidates that really on most of
[01:43:41.360 --> 01:43:45.560]  the issues would come down on our side on the constitutionalist libertarian side
[01:43:45.560 --> 01:43:50.000]  people like Rand Paul and as I mentioned before Sharon Angle but there's still
[01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:57.080]  this huge mass of people that will gleefully go to the polls in you know
[01:43:57.080 --> 01:44:01.800]  2012 and just put Mitt Romney in and we'll just get you know George W. Bush
[01:44:01.800 --> 01:44:08.320]  to again so I mean that's that's the avenue I see them going down but if it
[01:44:08.320 --> 01:44:12.920]  really gets out of hand with this economic collapse then who knows what
[01:44:12.920 --> 01:44:18.000]  was gonna happen good points Paul let's look at a few other staged crises that
[01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:23.400]  they can pull off I mean I've got a few that I want to list here but what are
[01:44:23.400 --> 01:44:29.400]  some of the other crises you see them using well obviously you've got the
[01:44:29.400 --> 01:44:35.880]  cybersecurity agenda Lieberman Joe Lieberman the sponsor of this bill which
[01:44:35.880 --> 01:44:41.200]  would give Obama the power to flick a virtual kill switch to shut down the
[01:44:41.200 --> 01:44:45.120]  internet for at least four months before he had to get congressional approval
[01:44:45.120 --> 01:44:51.760]  he openly unveiled the cybersecurity agenda for what it was last month in
[01:44:51.760 --> 01:44:58.080]  an interview with CNN's Candy Crowley when he said quote right now China the
[01:44:58.080 --> 01:45:02.960]  government can just disconnect parts of its internet in case of war and we need
[01:45:02.960 --> 01:45:08.320]  to have that here too so he's openly saying that cybersecurity is part of a
[01:45:08.320 --> 01:45:13.680]  move towards the Chinese style censorship and policing of the internet
[01:45:13.680 --> 01:45:21.760]  now as I wrote in my article today China's internet system has nothing
[01:45:21.760 --> 01:45:28.120]  whatsoever to do with quote war or security it's all centered around keeping
[01:45:28.120 --> 01:45:32.760]  people politically oppressed and stopping them from communicating with
[01:45:32.760 --> 01:45:39.480]  each other and organizing politically to get active and it's about censoring
[01:45:39.480 --> 01:45:44.440]  government atrocities and government cover-ups and government abuse so Lieberman
[01:45:44.440 --> 01:45:49.240]  has openly said that that's what cybersecurity represents we've got all
[01:45:49.240 --> 01:45:53.920]  these white house officials saying they want to censor it we've got the FCC
[01:45:53.920 --> 01:45:56.720]  saying we want to control the internet we've got him saying they want to put a
[01:45:56.720 --> 01:46:00.600]  tax on alternative media that's an official proposal by the Federal Trade
[01:46:00.600 --> 01:46:05.440]  Commission and the FCC to tax alternative media to quote fund a government
[01:46:05.440 --> 01:46:11.240]  megaphone on TV and establishment newspapers I mean this is a violation of
[01:46:11.240 --> 01:46:15.040]  the First Amendment it's the government involved in the quote free market and
[01:46:15.040 --> 01:46:19.560]  but briefly going back to China look at this AP article Beijing starts gating
[01:46:19.560 --> 01:46:24.440]  locking migrant villages and they write the article like it's a positive thing
[01:46:24.440 --> 01:46:29.080]  the government calls it sealed management China's capital has started
[01:46:29.080 --> 01:46:32.400]  gating and locking some of its lower-income neighborhoods overnight with
[01:46:32.400 --> 01:46:35.560]  police or security checking identification papers around the clock and a
[01:46:35.560 --> 01:46:38.480]  throwback to the old style of control there to do that in New York where they
[01:46:38.480 --> 01:46:41.920]  search for body out at night it's Beijing's latest effort to reduce rising
[01:46:41.920 --> 01:46:45.720]  crime often blamed on millions of rural Chinese migrating to the cities for New
[01:46:45.720 --> 01:46:49.720]  York I mean I mean for work I'm thinking of New York being a police state the
[01:46:49.720 --> 01:46:54.720]  capital's Communist Party secretary warns the approach promoted city-wide or
[01:46:54.720 --> 01:46:58.800]  once it promoted city-wide but some state media and experts say the move not
[01:46:58.800 --> 01:47:02.760]  only looks bad but imposes another layer of control we already stigmatized
[01:47:02.760 --> 01:47:08.200]  vulnerable migrants and so so far the gates have sealed off 16 villages in the
[01:47:08.200 --> 01:47:11.880]  sprawling southern suburbs where migrants are attached to cheaper rents and
[01:47:11.880 --> 01:47:19.240]  some villages outnumber permanent residents 10 to 1 yeah well it's not
[01:47:19.240 --> 01:47:23.360]  surprising that the Associated Press would report that with pleasure because
[01:47:23.360 --> 01:47:28.640]  as we said before the Chinese system is the goal in China even in the
[01:47:28.640 --> 01:47:34.680]  rich cities like Shanghai the richest cities you've got a two cast system
[01:47:34.680 --> 01:47:39.680]  you've got the people who've got some wealth right up against the poor and
[01:47:39.680 --> 01:47:44.480]  basically there's no middle-class whatsoever the poor can live right
[01:47:44.480 --> 01:47:47.880]  next to the rich you know they basically live on the street as it is in
[01:47:47.880 --> 01:47:52.480]  places like Shanghai it's admitted that CPS doesn't take the children of
[01:47:52.480 --> 01:47:56.960]  millions of workers that chain their children all day to telephone poles or
[01:47:56.960 --> 01:48:01.080]  to light poles and there's no environmental standards that they're
[01:48:01.080 --> 01:48:03.840]  having to put nets all over the factories for people jumping off
[01:48:03.840 --> 01:48:08.200]  committing suicide meanwhile this is what we're competing with when we buy
[01:48:08.200 --> 01:48:12.400]  these goods we are basically lowering ourselves to their level instead of
[01:48:12.400 --> 01:48:18.080]  demanding more tariffs so China has to raise it's in its quality of life it's
[01:48:18.080 --> 01:48:23.320]  actually a race to the bottom globalism when Obama at the G20 in Toronto a few
[01:48:23.320 --> 01:48:27.080]  weeks ago talked about no nation can be greater than any other he means all
[01:48:27.080 --> 01:48:32.440]  nations must be lowered not raise the poor nations globalism is feudalism
[01:48:32.440 --> 01:48:37.920]  yeah that's the whole point of the green economy it's to lower nations to a to
[01:48:37.920 --> 01:48:42.520]  lower first world nations to at least a second world status and it's proved
[01:48:42.520 --> 01:48:49.200]  absolutely disastrous in Spain where they've now got a 20% unemployment rate
[01:48:49.200 --> 01:48:54.040]  and 2.2 jobs are lost for every quote green job that's created mission
[01:48:54.040 --> 01:48:57.120]  accomplished and you say we're not against them it's just amazing to see
[01:48:57.120 --> 01:49:01.280]  it that now it's not Eastern Europeans and Arabs that are flooding England but
[01:49:01.280 --> 01:49:07.600]  that it's people from Spain there's an exodus yeah every every time I you know
[01:49:07.600 --> 01:49:13.400]  travel across the UK I see tons and tons of Spanish people which I never saw in
[01:49:13.400 --> 01:49:16.960]  the past and they're not Taurus because you know they've got baby strollers and
[01:49:16.960 --> 01:49:21.920]  they're going home on the train they've they've vacated Spain in their droves
[01:49:21.920 --> 01:49:26.000]  because it with this green economy everything's crashing and burning and
[01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:29.880]  they've got a you know double the unemployment rate that we've got in
[01:49:29.880 --> 01:49:33.520]  the UK which is bad enough as it is around that's what the new order is the
[01:49:33.520 --> 01:49:37.840]  OECD and all of them state this that they want a global government so there's
[01:49:37.840 --> 01:49:42.560]  nowhere to run and everywhere is in fact I saw the OECD a decade ago say
[01:49:42.560 --> 01:49:49.080]  France is the model with an 80 plus percent income tax yeah as I was saying
[01:49:49.080 --> 01:49:54.720]  before you know 80 plus percent income tax is not something that's out of the
[01:49:54.720 --> 01:50:00.920]  ordinary in the past hundred years it's only in the past few decades that most
[01:50:00.920 --> 01:50:06.840]  Western nations have had this you know in the UK and the US it's it's 40 to 50
[01:50:06.840 --> 01:50:13.520]  percent top bracket in the UK and in 1977 the nominal rate of income tax was
[01:50:13.520 --> 01:50:20.520]  98 percent everything you earned over 20,000 pounds which would be about
[01:50:20.520 --> 01:50:25.920]  $30,000 everything above that the vast majority of it went straight to the
[01:50:25.920 --> 01:50:31.520]  government now obviously we have to adjust for inflation in 2010 but on that
[01:50:31.520 --> 01:50:35.880]  scale the middle class would cease to exist because you would never be able
[01:50:35.880 --> 01:50:41.040]  to earn anything above a subsistence subsistence level income bracket
[01:50:41.040 --> 01:50:43.800]  well they're already trying to pass laws in England to keep you from leaving
[01:50:43.800 --> 01:50:48.440]  Paul I'm telling you you got to get out of there you need to get out of there

[01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:29.040]  coming up straight ahead including the one-child policy being promoted here in
[01:54:29.040 --> 01:54:33.000]  the United States oh cut your carbon footprint don't have any children or
[01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:38.760]  only have one you don't have the money anyways that is the stated goal that
[01:54:38.760 --> 01:54:42.320]  we're gonna go to phone calls here in just a moment with Paul Watson but Paul
[01:54:42.320 --> 01:54:46.040]  any other key points we haven't raised here today I mean I would just add I
[01:54:46.040 --> 01:54:51.720]  shot this video we posted it dealing with the road warrior level collapse
[01:54:51.720 --> 01:54:56.000]  imminent Alex Jones says we must take corrective action now I'm asking folks
[01:54:56.000 --> 01:54:59.800]  to get that video that's up on info wars.com prisonpunna.com and get it out
[01:54:59.800 --> 01:55:03.520]  to everyone so they know who the culprits are that is so essential or they'll
[01:55:03.520 --> 01:55:08.320]  continue to pose as our saviors and get more power there's so many other things
[01:55:08.320 --> 01:55:15.640]  going on what else is on your radar screen. No just to add I mean the point
[01:55:15.640 --> 01:55:20.560]  at which it all collapses as any good historian worth his salt will tell you
[01:55:20.560 --> 01:55:27.400]  is where you know the Empire's scramble to service its debt outweighs the
[01:55:27.400 --> 01:55:32.680]  expenditure on its military adventures and America is rapidly approaching that
[01:55:32.680 --> 01:55:39.040]  point and so you know when 20% of your tax money goes towards service in the
[01:55:39.040 --> 01:55:43.720]  federal debt that's when these austerity measures are really gonna start to buy
[01:55:43.720 --> 01:55:47.400]  it because they're gonna say there's a shortfall we need to make it up and I
[01:55:47.400 --> 01:55:51.600]  played a clip of Obama yesterday at the G20 saying really tough stuff coming next
[01:55:51.600 --> 01:55:58.440]  year big cuts in spending but that services not cuts in taxes. Exactly
[01:55:58.440 --> 01:56:02.120]  exactly the same thing as David Cameron said said it's gonna affect
[01:56:02.120 --> 01:56:06.960]  every single person in the United States in the United Kingdom and it's gonna be
[01:56:06.960 --> 01:56:12.880]  years and years of pain and you know that's when all this tyranny is gonna
[01:56:12.880 --> 01:56:16.880]  kick in but as we know with the comprehensive annual financial reports
[01:56:16.880 --> 01:56:20.640]  they can still afford to maintain all the public services this is about
[01:56:20.640 --> 01:56:27.120]  sucking the middle-class dry and completely collapsing. They run up the
[01:56:27.120 --> 01:56:30.440]  debts to them made up out of nothing then they implode everything and now
[01:56:30.440 --> 01:56:35.360]  Cameron has continued the ban on Michael Savage traveling to England he bans
[01:56:35.360 --> 01:56:39.160]  brits who've been in trouble at football games from leaving the country and so
[01:56:39.160 --> 01:56:43.160]  they're just setting up this Nazi Germany type scenario he's pushing the
[01:56:43.160 --> 01:56:47.120]  carbon taxes boy what a conservative revolution doesn't matter who you put
[01:56:47.120 --> 01:56:53.240]  in these creatures just continue the agenda. Well exactly I mean they had this
[01:56:53.240 --> 01:56:59.560]  big forum for which laws people in the UK want to repeal or which ones they
[01:56:59.560 --> 01:57:05.040]  wanted added and the big thing to come out of it was that people want disabled
[01:57:05.040 --> 01:57:11.440]  people in some cases and others to be sterilized. Yeah that was the daily male
[01:57:11.440 --> 01:57:17.160]  headline poor houses and sterilization. And there also there's an article out of
[01:57:17.160 --> 01:57:22.640]  Indy today where they're again seriously proposing to sterilize people and if
[01:57:22.640 --> 01:57:28.000]  people have forgotten from history sterilization leads to extermination
[01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:33.120]  350,000 people in Nazi Germany was sterilized and we all know what you know
[01:57:33.120 --> 01:57:37.120]  happened after that. Well that's right a lot of people out there who don't believe
[01:57:37.120 --> 01:57:40.680]  anything the media says claim that Hitler didn't kill a bunch of Jews gypsies
[01:57:40.680 --> 01:57:46.120]  Christians and others yes he did folks I've read Hitler's speeches I've read
[01:57:46.120 --> 01:57:49.480]  transcripts of his radio addresses of Joseph Goebbels of the Kaiser Wilhelm
[01:57:49.480 --> 01:57:53.200]  Institute and our government and the Rockefellers funded all of that and
[01:57:53.200 --> 01:57:57.400]  that was the Nuremberg defense the Nazis used and all this stuff was was
[01:57:57.400 --> 01:58:03.200]  created and was the pseudoscience of eugenics in England and this is the
[01:58:03.200 --> 01:58:08.080]  model that's being pushed and yes the Nazis were monsters and they did carry
[01:58:08.080 --> 01:58:14.520]  out eugenics. Marie Stokes who founded all the abortion clinics and
[01:58:14.520 --> 01:58:18.920]  concentrated them in the poor areas in the UK and the United States she wrote
[01:58:18.920 --> 01:58:25.560]  love letters to Hitler she attended the Nazi Congress on population control you
[01:58:25.560 --> 01:58:28.720]  know this came from Britain Hitler picked it up and it led to the mass
[01:58:28.720 --> 01:58:33.880]  extermination of millions of people not just Jews but undesirables disabled
[01:58:33.880 --> 01:58:39.080]  people and anyone that you know well said Watson well said we'll be back in 70
[01:58:39.080 --> 01:58:50.600]  seconds. Thank you for listening to GCN be sure to visit GCNLive.com today. This is
[01:58:50.600 --> 01:58:53.960]  Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power
[01:58:53.960 --> 01:58:57.880]  generator. Number one new climate legislation could easily double or
[01:58:57.880 --> 01:59:02.160]  triple your electric bill. Number two our new energy czar wants to control how
[01:59:02.160 --> 01:59:06.440]  much power your electric company allows you to have. It's true total government
[01:59:06.440 --> 01:59:10.760]  control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming. Number
[01:59:10.760 --> 01:59:14.680]  three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[01:59:14.680 --> 01:59:19.400]  and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem. Number four
[01:59:19.400 --> 01:59:23.560]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids. Every year thousands of

[02:00:50.720 --> 02:00:56.120]  getting edited by you and they made me real glad my second edited by me I don't
[02:00:56.120 --> 02:00:59.920]  know not by you but but you know I don't want him to I want him to make the film
[02:00:59.920 --> 02:01:03.640]  he wants to make I have a right to criticize it but Rodriguez did an
[02:01:03.640 --> 02:01:08.560]  interview with ain't it cool news and said look you know maybe this was gonna
[02:01:08.560 --> 02:01:12.920]  lead to violence and I had too much tequila you know showing a race war so
[02:01:12.920 --> 02:01:17.280]  some of this will be in the DVD extra but go ahead. That's what I was talking about
[02:01:17.280 --> 02:01:20.360]  about you know I'm saying you you put it out there and let people know what was
[02:01:20.360 --> 02:01:23.600]  going on and I called there for three weeks every day and I don't know if I
[02:01:23.600 --> 02:01:27.120]  got sick and tired of hearing my name you know so they go but my other comment
[02:01:27.120 --> 02:01:31.120]  is I'm gonna change Chicago and part of the group and we're going to the city
[02:01:31.120 --> 02:01:34.640]  hall on slide 28 and we're gonna protest about the water you know so we're
[02:01:34.640 --> 02:01:37.400]  gonna talk we're gonna take statements and we're gonna talk we're gonna go about
[02:01:37.400 --> 02:01:41.480]  six seven people a good group but we're gonna go every month and demanded we
[02:01:41.480 --> 02:01:45.720]  don't want no sodium fluoride in our water good and I want to put a call to
[02:01:45.720 --> 02:01:48.760]  all the other we are change groups to take it to the same thing and do the
[02:01:48.760 --> 02:01:52.640]  same things we're going to do we're gonna go every single month every month
[02:01:52.640 --> 02:01:56.120]  that they have a public talk on me and we're gonna talk about it and we're not
[02:01:56.120 --> 02:01:59.280]  gonna go talking all crazy so they can try to ban us or something but we're
[02:01:59.280 --> 02:02:03.920]  gonna go dress nicely talk professionally have statements have facts
[02:02:03.920 --> 02:02:07.320]  and I was just wondering if you could tell me if there was any way I can get
[02:02:07.320 --> 02:02:11.400]  some more facts about the sodium sodium fluoride in the water well Watson's
[02:02:11.400 --> 02:02:16.640]  written articles we've had the head toxicologist of the EPA on years ago
[02:02:16.640 --> 02:02:20.800]  they've testified before Congress where they say it's deadly poison causes brain
[02:02:20.800 --> 02:02:24.560]  damage the American Dental Association for four years has now told parents not
[02:02:24.560 --> 02:02:30.280]  to brush their children's teeth with fluoride I mean you can just Paul Watson
[02:02:30.280 --> 02:02:34.400]  I mean they now admit that aspartame's causing miscarriages well they knew that
[02:02:34.400 --> 02:02:39.520]  in the trials back in the 70s they know what sodium fluoride does I mean you can
[02:02:39.520 --> 02:02:43.640]  just search engine the term fluoride facts and there's you know tons of data
[02:02:43.640 --> 02:02:47.000]  sheets out there with key info Watson I mean what would you say before a
[02:02:47.000 --> 02:02:53.480]  council about fluoride there's an article I wrote called scientific study
[02:02:53.480 --> 02:02:58.200]  finds fluoride horror stories factual that's got a list of the evidence and
[02:02:58.200 --> 02:03:02.520]  is sourced and there's an excellent book which I'm reading at the moment which
[02:03:02.520 --> 02:03:07.920]  is called the fluoride deception by Christopher Bryson and in that book are
[02:03:07.920 --> 02:03:13.920]  literally hundreds of studies from Harvard Boston another major universe
[02:03:13.920 --> 02:03:20.120]  is that prove fluoride is a neurotoxin and it causes bone cancer and all the
[02:03:20.120 --> 02:03:24.440]  scientific studies are mentioned and discussed at length and reduces
[02:03:24.440 --> 02:03:30.160]  fertility and calcifies the organs and much of the quote calcium buildup you
[02:03:30.160 --> 02:03:34.760]  get in your arteries is the sodium fluoride congestive heart failure
[02:03:34.760 --> 02:03:40.040]  arterials I mean the list just goes on and on ladies and gentlemen I know
[02:03:40.040 --> 02:03:44.440]  they're gonna be there because I'm sorry go ahead and talk to them I went in
[02:03:44.440 --> 02:03:47.040]  there and talked to the some police officers and they told me there's like
[02:03:47.040 --> 02:03:50.400]  well the mayor's gonna be here this is a public open event for everybody so I was
[02:03:50.400 --> 02:03:55.320]  like okay and then another Alderman representative like one of them when
[02:03:55.320 --> 02:03:58.800]  the assistance came up and tried to find out what I wanted to talk about and I
[02:03:58.800 --> 02:04:02.240]  didn't want to tell them because it might have been like oh you know but I
[02:04:02.240 --> 02:04:06.880]  tried to look go there with fluoride fact sheets printed out and warn people
[02:04:06.880 --> 02:04:11.520]  because not only a sodium fluoride deadly between 150 and over 300 chemicals
[02:04:11.520 --> 02:04:16.400]  depending on what brand they buy most ever from China is dumped mercury lead
[02:04:16.400 --> 02:04:21.660]  arsenic I mean you can't make this up it's so bold it's so insane it's so in
[02:04:21.660 --> 02:04:25.840]  your face I mean it's a fact aspartame is in tens of thousands of foods now
[02:04:25.840 --> 02:04:30.640]  tens of thousands and they're now calling it new names like a mean oh sweet
[02:04:30.640 --> 02:04:35.120]  and things and it just devastates you all of this is admitted thank you for

[02:08:29.560 --> 02:08:34.560]  ahead and talk to Taylor in New Jersey you're on the air welcome hey Alex how
[02:08:34.560 --> 02:08:38.840]  you doing doing alright sir welcome hey I'm a prison plan TV remember I just had
[02:08:38.840 --> 02:08:43.560]  three quick things to ask you real quick go ahead I really want to ask you have
[02:08:43.560 --> 02:08:48.840]  you ever heard of Dr. Savy have you ever heard of BT cotton and how do you think
[02:08:48.840 --> 02:08:55.440]  they program these college professors okay the the names you threw out rungs
[02:08:55.440 --> 02:09:01.480]  and bells Sam again Dr. Savy he claims to cure AIDS supposedly defeated in
[02:09:01.480 --> 02:09:05.120]  New York Supreme Court in 1988 claiming he cured AIDS and defeated them
[02:09:05.120 --> 02:09:09.720]  supposedly you know I don't know enough about that to be able to comment on it I
[02:09:09.720 --> 02:09:15.120]  know HIV is just an overall cover for soft-kill weapon testing going on in the
[02:09:15.120 --> 02:09:20.320]  third world and we know they developed a autoimmune virus there's government
[02:09:20.320 --> 02:09:23.920]  documents on that they didn't call it AIDS but that was done in the 70s by the
[02:09:23.920 --> 02:09:29.600]  Navy in their weapons labs and we've had guests on on those subjects but
[02:09:29.600 --> 02:09:34.040]  specifically you're saying how do they program college professors very simply
[02:09:34.040 --> 02:09:38.400]  you can either be a right winger and buy into the fake right wing paradigm kind
[02:09:38.400 --> 02:09:42.800]  of the Republican's mainline system and you get tenure and funding and books
[02:09:42.800 --> 02:09:48.000]  published in you know additional research funds so instead of making 50,000
[02:09:48.000 --> 02:09:52.160]  a year as a professor if you play ball you can make millions a year or you can
[02:09:52.160 --> 02:09:55.640]  be a leftist professor and be given foundation and government funding as
[02:09:55.640 --> 02:09:59.280]  well so it's the research funding that president Dwight D Eisenhower talked
[02:09:59.280 --> 02:10:03.480]  about at that time close to 90% was government funded and that he talked
[02:10:03.480 --> 02:10:06.840]  about the dangerous influence of the military industrial complex by a
[02:10:06.840 --> 02:10:10.760]  technological elite or a scientific dictatorship so that's how they control
[02:10:10.760 --> 02:10:14.680]  the professors. Oh wait because this is disgusting because I'm a division one
[02:10:14.680 --> 02:10:17.800]  athlete myself I'm on full scholarship which is it makes it ridiculous when
[02:10:17.800 --> 02:10:21.640]  athletes act like they can't be awake too but I'm on full scholarship I play
[02:10:21.640 --> 02:10:25.160]  quarterback at the University of Tennessee at Martin and I mean it's the
[02:10:25.160 --> 02:10:28.400]  professors are really just disgusting how they protect the global warming thing
[02:10:28.400 --> 02:10:31.600]  and I mean it's they don't answer any questions you can't bring up anything
[02:10:31.600 --> 02:10:35.200]  they really shut down the cloud like it's ridiculous how they don't they
[02:10:35.200 --> 02:10:38.320]  act like it's a conspiracy theory to make me out to be a nut whenever I ask
[02:10:38.320 --> 02:10:41.920]  them anything that well I remember those out that the New York Times reported on
[02:10:41.920 --> 02:10:45.440]  last week but they said it was a good thing that all the main global warming
[02:10:45.440 --> 02:10:49.720]  professors over the top colleges in the world are receiving funding and they are
[02:10:49.720 --> 02:10:54.760]  told by the UN do not talk to the media do not answer questions because they
[02:10:54.760 --> 02:10:59.280]  can't listen I saw headlines all this week again the Arctic and Antarctic is
[02:10:59.280 --> 02:11:07.080]  melting okay well you know in the Arctic it is summer right now it's winter in
[02:11:07.080 --> 02:11:11.280]  the Antarctic and so when it's summer the ice sheet always gets smaller and
[02:11:11.280 --> 02:11:14.120]  then it gets bigger in the winter it expands and contracts but they will
[02:11:14.120 --> 02:11:17.880]  show the glaciers melting and say we're all dead and the sea levels are going to
[02:11:17.880 --> 02:11:22.120]  come up meanwhile Al Gore is out buying 15 million dollar houses right on the
[02:11:22.120 --> 02:11:26.800]  beach I mean it's it's even if you believe carbon dioxide is deadly how does
[02:11:26.800 --> 02:11:31.040]  cutting our carbon dioxide the humans exhale and putting taxes on Europe and
[02:11:31.040 --> 02:11:36.000]  the West and then no taxes on China India Mexico and other third world
[02:11:36.000 --> 02:11:41.040]  nations when then our industry moves there then the carbon dioxide input
[02:11:41.040 --> 02:11:48.040]  actually goes up you you say that to the professor yeah I'll tell them I got
[02:11:48.040 --> 02:11:51.560]  point all the facts about climate heat I bring it all up to him it's really
[02:11:51.560 --> 02:11:55.160]  disgusting I mean I tell him you know I tell I tell him everything they want to
[02:11:55.160 --> 02:11:58.760]  act like I'm in that it's ridiculous I mean well look sir
[02:11:58.760 --> 02:12:04.840]  congressman stark two weeks ago said in a town hall there is no problem on the
[02:12:04.840 --> 02:12:09.920]  border two days ago senator harry reid in a video interview we've we've got the
[02:12:09.920 --> 02:12:13.880]  clip but it's up on info wars in prison plan people want to see it maybe we'll
[02:12:13.880 --> 02:12:17.200]  have time to play it it's a short clip and they said we have a big problem with
[02:12:17.200 --> 02:12:23.720]  illegal aliens in construction this you know research study shows that 70% of
[02:12:23.720 --> 02:12:26.560]  construction workers are illegal aliens he says that's not true they're none in
[02:12:26.560 --> 02:12:31.880]  Arizona they're none in Nevada and it turns out in Nevada they have double
[02:12:31.880 --> 02:12:37.080]  that number so I mean they just lie to you I mean if you say anything to them
[02:12:37.080 --> 02:12:40.680]  they'll lie to you I mean I've seen them lie and say that Margaret Sanger wasn't
[02:12:40.680 --> 02:12:44.600]  a Nazi I mean this is just what they do they have no respect for you they
[02:12:44.600 --> 02:12:49.560]  stonewall you because they know it's their eugenics religion it's their
[02:12:49.560 --> 02:12:53.960]  excuse to collect device things so if I was you I just get your degree get your
[02:12:53.960 --> 02:12:58.560]  scholarship play ball and move on because it sounds like you know you're
[02:12:58.560 --> 02:13:03.200]  getting a good deal out of it and you you know the truth and so I would just
[02:13:03.200 --> 02:13:08.000]  hand out flyers wake up the students to the to the brainwashing but you're
[02:13:08.000 --> 02:13:12.240]  probably wasting your time with these arrogant people they they're running a
[02:13:12.240 --> 02:13:15.880]  cult a eugenics cult we're gonna cover that coming up at the bottom of the hour
[02:13:15.880 --> 02:13:19.920]  anything else Taylor oh yeah I was gonna say BT cotton and now like it's in our
[02:13:19.920 --> 02:13:22.720]  women's tampons and diapers and other things like that now that's just
[02:13:22.720 --> 02:13:25.960]  disgusting I mean hybrid plants in general people need to really research
[02:13:25.960 --> 02:13:29.200]  hybrid plants and what they're doing with the genetic modification with the
[02:13:29.200 --> 02:13:33.520]  cotton like how 88% of the U.S. cotton I'm a plant soil science major so like I
[02:13:33.520 --> 02:13:36.720]  don't see all this stuff and I mean they try to tell me that it's not like
[02:13:36.720 --> 02:13:40.760]  all in like ingesting all like a roundup ready and all these things are like it
[02:13:40.760 --> 02:13:43.880]  won't hurt you and over time I'm trying to tell them it builds up over time and
[02:13:43.880 --> 02:13:48.840]  they won't listen I'm telling about soft kills just disgusting I mean Taylor
[02:13:48.840 --> 02:13:51.400]  write an article about it you want to write an article if you want to use the
[02:13:51.400 --> 02:13:55.920]  pseudonym that's fine as a student studying this technology send it to
[02:13:55.920 --> 02:13:59.280]  writers and infowars.com we'll check out the facts if it's good we'll post it
[02:13:59.280 --> 02:14:03.120]  God bless you that's how you fight back start your own blog create your own
[02:14:03.120 --> 02:14:07.040]  system you know you're an agent of liberty inside that brainwashing
[02:14:07.040 --> 02:14:12.480]  facility and so be subversive against their subversion of truth listen let's
[02:14:12.480 --> 02:14:18.720]  just search engine it right now farm animals dying animals fed BT cotton die
[02:14:18.720 --> 02:14:22.240]  because what they do is they feed the seeds that are stripped out in the
[02:14:22.240 --> 02:14:26.880]  machines when they take the seeds out of the cotton that's been grown that's
[02:14:26.880 --> 02:14:32.000]  grown from BT they can soak the roundup ready on the corn on the cotton on the
[02:14:32.000 --> 02:14:39.080]  soybeans the plants don't die they absorb it and I mean I just had Mr. Smith on
[02:14:39.080 --> 02:14:45.480]  a few weeks ago Jeffrey Smith about all the mainline studies that they feed BT
[02:14:45.480 --> 02:14:50.440]  cotton seeds to cows they feed it to pigs they feed it to other farm animals
[02:14:50.440 --> 02:14:54.120]  and they get sick and die and that's a hundred percent in India and the United
[02:14:54.120 --> 02:14:58.320]  States a hundred percent fact they know it's a hundred percent fact in fact
[02:14:58.320 --> 02:15:01.960]  search engine right now for people let's just show them farm animals fed BT
[02:15:01.960 --> 02:15:07.000]  cotton seeds sick and dying I mean they know they know I mean they got German
[02:15:07.000 --> 02:15:13.560]  studies about the BT pollen other bugs won't eat it but the the bees do and
[02:15:13.560 --> 02:15:17.880]  they die and they find it in their intestines sickness and death and animals
[02:15:17.880 --> 02:15:25.840]  exposed to BT cotton GM watch.org academic review genetic roulette claim
[02:15:25.840 --> 02:15:30.880]  sheep diet or grazing and BT cotton I mean there's a whole bunch of articles
[02:15:30.880 --> 02:15:35.640]  right there and it just goes on and on and on BT cotton is killing animals in
[02:15:35.640 --> 02:15:41.080]  India and affecting humans it goes on BT cotton killing animals in North India on
[02:15:41.080 --> 02:15:46.200]  large scale and he just keeps scrolling down through them there's the Hindustan

[02:15:50.960 --> 02:15:54.000]  mainstream paper keep us just keep reading headlines keep scrolling sure
[02:15:54.000 --> 02:15:57.440]  there's tens of thousands you can read for yourself that's what I mean it hit
[02:15:57.440 --> 02:16:03.040]  me this morning when I was driving into work because I'm saying to myself man
[02:16:03.040 --> 02:16:07.400]  you're giving up opportunities to have a reality show and maybe if you do that
[02:16:07.400 --> 02:16:10.680]  then it'll get your name out there more and people will get your real info or
[02:16:10.680 --> 02:16:13.240]  you're not gonna go do this history channel show you're not you're saying
[02:16:13.240 --> 02:16:18.280]  I know all this stuff and and you know what about your career and all this I
[02:16:18.280 --> 02:16:24.160]  could care less and and then I just thought to myself I mean I this is
[02:16:24.160 --> 02:16:29.680]  such a nightmare I know aspartame is in tens of thousands of products foods
[02:16:29.680 --> 02:16:37.320]  cake mixes candy gum even the regular sugar stuff hasn't added I know that
[02:16:37.320 --> 02:16:41.360]  the government knew when they approved it that it killed the majority of the
[02:16:41.360 --> 02:16:47.800]  monkeys they fed it to me it kills you I know BT cotton is killing the animals
[02:16:47.800 --> 02:16:53.240]  that eat it I know the BT corn is killing the bees well the US has lost more
[02:16:53.240 --> 02:16:59.600]  than half of them I know that sodium fluoride brain damages us I know the
[02:16:59.600 --> 02:17:03.560]  genetically modified salmon are designed to take over and cause extinction in
[02:17:03.560 --> 02:17:06.760]  the normal salmon populations and the government knows that in its mainstream
[02:17:06.760 --> 02:17:13.120]  news McClatchy newspapers two days ago I know I'm telling the truth I know
[02:17:13.120 --> 02:17:19.800]  there's a giant eugenics operation and we're arguing about is it racist to be
[02:17:19.800 --> 02:17:22.320]  against government-run health care the government health care is to take
[02:17:22.320 --> 02:17:26.120]  control of your life and carry out eugenics and have government-run systems
[02:17:26.120 --> 02:17:33.580]  of diagnosis I know that all of this is being done it's a hundred percent how
[02:17:33.580 --> 02:17:37.720]  can I even hate some dumb cop who comes over and threatens me and violates my
[02:17:37.720 --> 02:17:41.320]  rights sure five six years ago I get angry and hate them now I just see some
[02:17:41.320 --> 02:17:47.160]  poor poison zombie who I cry at night wishing I could reach him I mean these
[02:17:47.160 --> 02:17:51.640]  stupid politicians they don't know it's the scientific elite I'm making a film
[02:17:51.640 --> 02:17:56.320]  about this right now and I know all the info but I'm so immersed in it and I'm
[02:17:56.320 --> 02:18:01.720]  learning so much it's just it's unspeakable it's all around us and
[02:18:01.720 --> 02:18:07.400]  they're announcing every day in fact search engine infertility at epidemic
[02:18:07.400 --> 02:18:11.680]  levels worldwide search that term and it I mean there are countries where the
[02:18:11.680 --> 02:18:20.040]  majority of men are almost completely infertile there are it's happening the

[02:18:23.960 --> 02:18:33.800]  cancer you are being murdered it is 100% fact 99.9% of us are not on the
[02:18:33.800 --> 02:18:37.040]  winning end of this even if you're a psychopath and love killing people with
[02:18:37.040 --> 02:18:41.400]  that's how the scientists do it with covert soft degenerative kill systems
[02:18:41.400 --> 02:18:46.880]  that take time they love it this is how these cowardly creeps do it and they
[02:18:46.880 --> 02:18:50.280]  laugh and think you're too stupid to be aware of it they write textbooks on how
[02:18:50.280 --> 02:18:53.520]  they're doing it we've quoted them here we've written countless articles I've
[02:18:53.520 --> 02:19:02.160]  made films I said I'd take your calls it's just if you're an FBI agent watching

[02:24:34.920 --> 02:24:41.400]  because yeah I mean we all have some limit of courage but it takes a real
[02:24:41.400 --> 02:24:46.840]  man to be able to do what you're doing and two months ago when I started
[02:24:46.840 --> 02:24:51.320]  listening to your show I said I need to start a blog about this and then I
[02:24:51.320 --> 02:24:56.400]  started a blog and then the next day I said no I need a radio blog so I
[02:24:56.400 --> 02:25:02.880]  started a radio blog and you know it's it's hard it's hard to do this I don't
[02:25:02.880 --> 02:25:06.840]  know how you do it every day it's hard to think about everything that's going on
[02:25:06.840 --> 02:25:13.800]  and why in the hell don't more people know and I like turning our entire
[02:25:13.800 --> 02:25:20.360]  environment into a toxic witches brew for control and they're taking all of
[02:25:20.360 --> 02:25:23.760]  our food supplies and adulterating them they're genetically engineering the
[02:25:23.760 --> 02:25:29.800]  entire biosphere all of it by design to sterilize and and poison us I mean this
[02:25:29.800 --> 02:25:34.040]  is real and and really everything else is secondary and they're bringing down
[02:25:34.040 --> 02:25:37.840]  our financial system they're assaulting our farms and ranches everything they're
[02:25:37.840 --> 02:25:44.640]  doing is to gain total control yeah and you know I was in the army I never
[02:25:44.640 --> 02:25:51.280]  deployed but I know I was under that brainwashing system you know that uh
[02:25:51.280 --> 02:25:55.120]  you know the government's good the government's good and for years I'm
[02:25:55.120 --> 02:26:01.480]  23 now but until I really open my eyes and started seeing the big picture for
[02:26:01.480 --> 02:26:07.800]  like 22 years I know what I was taught to know okay through the media the
[02:26:07.800 --> 02:26:13.880]  mainstream media and I you know it's it's mind-boggling well you've started
[02:26:13.880 --> 02:26:17.640]  your journey into a wider world and it's good to hear from you Alex keep it up

[02:31:02.600 --> 02:31:07.040]  consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could
[02:31:07.040 --> 02:31:11.040]  easily double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are
[02:31:11.040 --> 02:31:14.960]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's
[02:31:14.960 --> 02:31:19.000]  true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[02:31:19.000 --> 02:31:23.560]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[02:31:23.560 --> 02:31:27.560]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[02:31:27.560 --> 02:31:31.360]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[02:31:31.360 --> 02:31:35.000]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[02:31:35.000 --> 02:31:39.320]  related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[02:31:39.320 --> 02:31:42.480]  insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar power

[02:32:33.280 --> 02:33:01.280]  soap Marty Schachter and see what he has to say
[02:33:03.280 --> 02:33:20.640]  okay I'm gonna go through a lot of news first I want to point out that I don't
[02:33:20.640 --> 02:33:25.800]  subscribe the time magazine Newsweek but when I'm in a Whole Foods when I'm an
[02:33:25.800 --> 02:33:30.680]  H.E.B. grocery stores or when I'm at a dental office or my parents house I see
[02:33:30.680 --> 02:33:36.720]  mainstream magazines laying everywhere and whether it is magazines like National
[02:33:36.720 --> 02:33:42.760]  Geographic or Time it's the case for killing granny euthanasia is good death
[02:33:42.760 --> 02:33:50.040]  panels are good suicide is good one child policy is good New York Times that
[02:33:50.040 --> 02:33:53.520]  you know the final generation a few weeks ago written by Peter Singer the
[02:33:53.520 --> 02:33:58.320]  eugenesis about how we shouldn't be allowed to have any children Fox News you
[02:33:58.320 --> 02:34:03.900]  know having more children's bad for the planet should we put taxes on it this is
[02:34:03.900 --> 02:34:07.440]  their religion that humans are bad that the elite have got to get rid of us as
[02:34:07.440 --> 02:34:12.080]  the club of Rome said they would use a fake environmental movement to shut off
[02:34:12.080 --> 02:34:15.840]  resources to the world population to where you're too poor to be able to have
[02:34:15.840 --> 02:34:19.080]  children and then if you are poor and have children they're gonna come and say
[02:34:19.080 --> 02:34:23.800]  you're neglecting them and take them well here is Time Magazine the only child
[02:34:23.800 --> 02:34:32.280]  myth this is the current July 19th issue this week's issue and it says they're
[02:34:32.280 --> 02:34:36.440]  supposed to be selfish spoiled and lonely in fact they're just fine on the
[02:34:36.440 --> 02:34:40.920]  rise so I saw this and I knew it would glorify having an only child not that
[02:34:40.920 --> 02:34:45.160]  that's bad I was an only child till my sister came along when I was 14 so that's
[02:34:45.160 --> 02:34:49.600]  basically like being an only child but I knew it would spin it like this is the
[02:34:49.600 --> 02:34:56.800]  avant-garde cool trendy thing to do and remember this targets mainly middle class
[02:34:56.800 --> 02:35:01.000]  people and that's who's not having children the entire West is dying 1.3
[02:35:01.000 --> 02:35:05.840]  percent replacement rate for every two parents 1.3 children on average and I
[02:35:05.840 --> 02:35:09.080]  knew before I opened it because it's always the same propaganda they would
[02:35:09.080 --> 02:35:18.160]  say the economy's bad it's bad for the carbon output of the earth we need to have
[02:35:18.160 --> 02:35:21.680]  a one-child policy and you open it up that give me a document camp shot on
[02:35:21.680 --> 02:35:28.040]  this voice for prison planet TV viewers you open this up and sure enough there
[02:35:28.040 --> 02:35:33.680]  it is one and done the economy is sluggish expenses are up and raising
[02:35:33.680 --> 02:35:37.840]  kids cost a bundle what better time to abandon the stereotypes and embrace the
[02:35:37.840 --> 02:35:43.200]  possibilities of the only child and then it's basically a eugenics article
[02:35:43.200 --> 02:35:47.080]  about how great it is and my wife we have three children she said people
[02:35:47.080 --> 02:35:50.640]  actually say to her that it's bad to have three children in the grocery store
[02:35:50.640 --> 02:35:57.680]  these are the eugenicists and so this is how they are pushing the wonderful
[02:35:57.680 --> 02:36:04.360]  trendiness of all of this and then they have a community task force that are
[02:36:04.360 --> 02:36:09.960]  harassing people who have too much stuff in their house so CPS for adults
[02:36:09.960 --> 02:36:15.240]  eldercare again eugenics was established in the 1860s in England they
[02:36:15.240 --> 02:36:22.160]  created social workers for racial hygiene to basically assault the poor so
[02:36:22.160 --> 02:36:26.760]  that's what's going on there and as the economy implodes they're going to blame
[02:36:26.760 --> 02:36:30.760]  everything on poor people and on families not on the bankers that did
[02:36:30.760 --> 02:36:34.480]  this who were eugenicists to a man at the top here's another one population
[02:36:34.480 --> 02:36:38.120]  control advocate wanted to sterilize food and water to sterilize people mark
[02:36:38.120 --> 02:36:44.480]  Moreno climate depot talking about it Paul Ehrlich George Bush's advisor that's
[02:36:44.480 --> 02:36:48.080]  just today this is without looking and I just covered of course aspartame
[02:36:48.080 --> 02:36:52.320]  sterilizing women mainstream news causing miscarriages I just covered the
[02:36:52.320 --> 02:36:59.960]  BT corn and BT cotton when they feed the seeds to animals they have miscarriages
[02:36:59.960 --> 02:37:05.120]  or reduced fertility or die in fact put up that Google search page with BT cotton
[02:37:05.120 --> 02:37:11.640]  killing animals you'll get thousands and thousands of searches where mass death
[02:37:11.640 --> 02:37:16.280]  and sheep from grazing GE cotton you know mainstream news government studies
[02:37:16.280 --> 02:37:22.000]  university studies you name it it's all there continuing so so you're eating
[02:37:22.000 --> 02:37:26.280]  this and in having miscarriage miscarriage miscarriage reduced fertility
[02:37:26.280 --> 02:37:33.480]  sterilize the poor and bring back the workhouse that's a male online story
[02:37:33.480 --> 02:37:37.280]  here's the Wall Street Journal would recession be good for the environment
[02:37:37.280 --> 02:37:42.560]  lowering our carbon footprint it's a good thing here's another one planet save
[02:37:42.560 --> 02:37:48.320]  another article about that articles all over about the population exploding the
[02:37:48.320 --> 02:37:54.480]  UN says we've got to reduce it Bill Gates says it cap and trade bill will be
[02:37:54.480 --> 02:37:59.640]  part of Senate climate change bill so they're now announcing that they're
[02:37:59.640 --> 02:38:04.800]  going to go ahead and try to pass the cap and trade polar bear populations
[02:38:04.800 --> 02:38:11.240]  exploding despite lies of the media evening standard Prince Charles says
[02:38:11.240 --> 02:38:16.360]  that he's launched a stinging attack on climate skeptics deriding them for
[02:38:16.360 --> 02:38:23.040]  peddling pseudo science when they've been caught engaged in mass fraud so
[02:38:23.040 --> 02:38:30.520]  that is in the eugenics stack today they admit that a Vandy and is causing
[02:38:30.520 --> 02:38:34.240]  heart attacks but the government says is going to stay on the market another
[02:38:34.240 --> 02:38:37.880]  article no shot no school for Alabama sixth graders as the school year gets
[02:38:37.880 --> 02:38:42.560]  ready to begin in a month but similar articles run everywhere telling you it's
[02:38:42.560 --> 02:38:46.120]  the law you got to take shots no it's policy that you've got to take the shots
[02:38:46.120 --> 02:38:50.160]  and by law they've got to give you a waiver form but a waiver to a law that
[02:38:50.160 --> 02:38:55.000]  does not exist mobile phones causing memory loss brain damage everything they
[02:38:55.000 --> 02:39:00.240]  deploy is meant to soft kill you people say well then why do you promote an
[02:39:00.240 --> 02:39:03.760]  iPhone app well if we can reach sheeple through cell phones and through the
[02:39:03.760 --> 02:39:06.400]  devices frying their brains why not I mean what I'm not supposed to go into
[02:39:06.400 --> 02:39:10.520]  the matrix I'm supposed to jack into the matrix and you know go in there and get
[02:39:10.520 --> 02:39:13.960]  people out of it I mean what do you what are you talking about continuing
[02:39:13.960 --> 02:39:19.000]  ladies and gentlemen BP fixes golf well and then it's a spin article in USA
[02:39:19.000 --> 02:39:23.000]  they said they've gotten the cap on but but they're not sure to effect do we
[02:39:23.000 --> 02:39:28.640]  ever pull up the latest live video from the wellhead can we pull up the webcam
[02:39:28.640 --> 02:39:33.640]  of that I want to put that on screen even if I've moved on government expert
[02:39:33.640 --> 02:39:38.400]  witness over 42 million gallons of dispersion used during BP oil disaster
[02:39:38.400 --> 02:39:42.440]  that's more than 40 times what they previously claimed even professors it
[02:39:42.440 --> 02:39:48.360]  reports who believe that the dispersion is good they say this is way too much to
[02:39:48.360 --> 02:39:52.320]  use so that's the live feed does that look like that's been capped to you
[02:39:52.320 --> 02:39:57.480]  that's the live feed that says live that's the live feed does that look like
[02:39:57.480 --> 02:40:00.720]  that's been capped to you but hey they say it's been capped in USA today so it
[02:40:00.720 --> 02:40:04.920]  must be true how many times they claim they kept it now that's fixed I wish it
[02:40:04.920 --> 02:40:09.160]  was true but my god they practice lies government expert witness 42 million
[02:40:09.160 --> 02:40:12.440]  gallons of dispersion being used in the Gulf Christopher ready associate

[02:40:41.520 --> 02:40:45.400]  they call it from France to England every day unlimited illegals are allowed
[02:40:45.400 --> 02:40:50.560]  to just pour in to the country here's the Washington Times Justice Department
[02:40:50.560 --> 02:40:55.360]  so sanctuary city safe from law we got pursuing Arizona and arguing that the
[02:40:55.360 --> 02:40:58.040]  state's immigration law creates a patchwork of rules the above
[02:40:58.040 --> 02:41:02.360]  administration said it would not go after so-called sanctuary cities that
[02:41:02.360 --> 02:41:06.120]  refused to cooperate with the federal government on immigration enforcement on
[02:41:06.120 --> 02:41:10.840]  the grounds that they are not as bad as the states that of that actively
[02:41:10.840 --> 02:41:14.560]  interferes yeah by saying if we catch any legal in another crime we're gonna
[02:41:14.560 --> 02:41:18.680]  take them to the feds the feds say no and then they lobby for the 800 plus
[02:41:18.680 --> 02:41:23.920]  cities to not stop the illegals continuing with the immigration issue
[02:41:23.920 --> 02:41:30.080]  crisis for senator Reed as critics slam read on immigration remark from
[02:41:30.080 --> 02:41:34.440]  politico and you can go watch the video what he had to say they say we have
[02:41:34.440 --> 02:41:38.960]  record numbers of illegals in the construction industry and their dodge
[02:41:38.960 --> 02:41:42.400]  and taxes and all this stuff and he says we have no problem in Nevada and
[02:41:42.400 --> 02:41:47.360]  they're yeah I mean no problem and you saw Senate a congressman start two weeks
[02:41:47.360 --> 02:41:51.160]  ago say there's no border problem no illegal no immigration problem they just
[02:41:51.160 --> 02:41:54.520]  throw it in your face and just say there there are no illegal aliens working
[02:41:54.520 --> 02:41:58.640]  in construction in the bodies it is just the none of them here and then the
[02:41:58.640 --> 02:42:06.000]  major research group basically funded by La Raza it's a study to try to get I
[02:42:06.000 --> 02:42:10.600]  guess voting rights or something shows that it's actually double that so double
[02:42:10.600 --> 02:42:17.240]  17% in Nevada the worst in the nation but he says no problem continuing on the
[02:42:17.240 --> 02:42:23.720]  illegal alien front Utah agencies probe alleged illegal immigrant lift and it
[02:42:23.720 --> 02:42:27.240]  looks like somebody inside the state government released a list of 1,300
[02:42:27.240 --> 02:42:31.160]  people that the government knows via audits have got fake social security
[02:42:31.160 --> 02:42:35.040]  numbers and they're causing calling this a Nazi list in the media like the
[02:42:35.040 --> 02:42:37.800]  government's making list on people the government's making list on everybody
[02:42:37.800 --> 02:42:41.160]  dealing with taxes they're tracking everybody just the illegals are above
[02:42:41.160 --> 02:42:47.920]  the law continuing here Dick Cheney undergoes heart surgery he's literally
[02:42:47.920 --> 02:42:51.280]  like Darth Vader now and had a high-tech heart pump added to one of his
[02:42:51.280 --> 02:42:55.320]  ventricles to pump the blood for him he's had five heart attacks and many
[02:42:55.320 --> 02:43:00.520]  other surgeries so Satan went under the knife and lived
[02:43:02.640 --> 02:43:08.440]  continuing US taxpayers to subsidize new UN agency promoting abortion cyber
[02:43:08.440 --> 02:43:14.120]  news service reports an additional 500 million the United Nations agency that
[02:43:14.120 --> 02:43:18.000]  will promote abortion agendas including forced abortion and fantaside in China
[02:43:18.000 --> 02:43:25.320]  they get UN awards for that so that is just some of the news on that front
[02:43:25.320 --> 02:43:31.680]  continuing with the disinformation piece over the weekend I got emails I got
[02:43:31.680 --> 02:43:39.400]  calls I saw messages on the text comments all in full wars in prison
[02:43:39.400 --> 02:43:45.360]  planet saying Alex why aren't you covering the Taliban and monkeys that
[02:43:45.360 --> 02:43:49.160]  are trained with machine guns to kill our troops because I know enough about
[02:43:49.160 --> 02:43:54.680]  primates even chimpanzees the most intelligent or silverback African apes
[02:43:54.680 --> 02:44:00.960]  to know that monkeys and apes cannot be trained to differentiate and if you
[02:44:00.960 --> 02:44:05.280]  trained I mean you might be able to train a ape or a monkey to stay behind at
[02:44:05.280 --> 02:44:10.360]  your house with a gun but statistically it would end up one day having fun and
[02:44:10.360 --> 02:44:14.240]  shooting you not knowing and so I knew it was just ridiculous put out by our
[02:44:14.240 --> 02:44:19.680]  government and others that those dirty al-Qaeda's had had armies of monkeys so
[02:44:19.680 --> 02:44:24.960]  this is not planet of the apes me a document cam shot on that this is not
[02:44:24.960 --> 02:44:28.800]  planet of the apes my friends that's only in the Hollywood movies but you know
[02:44:28.800 --> 02:44:33.040]  the CIA admits they put out fake al-Qaeda bin Laden tapes that's now admitted
[02:44:33.040 --> 02:44:37.240]  what a month and a half ago in the Washington Post and they they admit
[02:44:37.240 --> 02:44:41.880]  they put out fake videos for you now and they claim they kill al-Qaeda leaders
[02:44:41.880 --> 02:44:44.760]  over and over and over again and never retract the last time they killed the
[02:44:44.760 --> 02:44:48.080]  same leader so why not tell you deadly monkeys are coming and planet of the
[02:44:48.080 --> 02:44:54.880]  apes is real I mean this is just just amazing developments on that front
[02:44:54.880 --> 02:45:00.680]  going over the economy here top Clinton official only a terror attack can save
[02:45:00.680 --> 02:45:05.280]  Obama told the Financial Times of London that Robert Shapiro see the only way he
[02:45:05.280 --> 02:45:09.880]  can rally and look like a strong leader is from Oklahoma City or 9-11 type
[02:45:09.880 --> 02:45:13.360]  attack that information is key in fact here's just the quote the bottom line
[02:45:13.360 --> 02:45:16.720]  here is that Americans don't believe in President Obama's leadership to Robert
[02:45:16.720 --> 02:45:21.200]  Shapiro he has defined some way between now and November of demonstrating that
[02:45:21.200 --> 02:45:25.040]  he is a leader who can command confidence in sort of a 9-11 event or an
[02:45:25.040 --> 02:45:30.640]  Oklahoma City bombing I can't think of how he could do just that

[02:47:35.640 --> 02:47:44.240]  reports that is just some of the news and information there's more and more
[02:47:44.240 --> 02:47:47.920]  taxes being passed that are aimed at people's social behavior but next it
[02:47:47.920 --> 02:47:53.320]  will be beef and beer and things like that US pockets 20.6 billion in sin
[02:47:53.320 --> 02:47:57.960]  taxes and fiscal year oh nine those numbers have now come into Reuters so
[02:47:57.960 --> 02:48:04.120]  that also targets the poorest Americans Obama enlist Bill Clinton to aid him on

[02:48:08.720 --> 02:48:12.920]  below Clintons are a little bit higher so they're enlisting that shyster and
[02:48:12.920 --> 02:48:18.520]  scam artist and fraud to go out in a dupe all of the people that have pushed
[02:48:18.520 --> 02:48:29.640]  his supposed economic reforms so that is just some of the information that we
[02:48:29.640 --> 02:48:33.640]  have on the financial front on the international military front study
[02:48:33.640 --> 02:48:38.200]  says that an attack on Iran would be the start of a long war Iran's response to
[02:48:38.200 --> 02:48:42.200]  an attack could send oil prices through the roof think tank argues an Israeli
[02:48:42.200 --> 02:48:46.080]  attack on Iran would fail to stop Tehran's alleged nuclear weapons
[02:48:46.080 --> 02:48:49.880]  program and would lead to a long war that's exactly what the rank corporation
[02:48:49.880 --> 02:48:54.880]  called for two years ago that would be marked by economic instability and mass
[02:48:54.880 --> 02:49:01.480]  civilian casualties says a study from a British think tank and a report released
[02:49:01.480 --> 02:49:04.840]  Wednesday by the Oxford research group stated that while the likelihood of a
[02:49:04.840 --> 02:49:08.960]  U.S. attack on Iran's nuclear program has been lessened by the Obama
[02:49:08.960 --> 02:49:12.400]  administration's policies that's not true they're building up for it advances
[02:49:12.400 --> 02:49:15.360]  in Israeli military technology have increased the potential for an Israeli
[02:49:15.360 --> 02:49:19.520]  attack the study entitled military action against Iran impact and effects
[02:49:19.520 --> 02:49:23.560]  also argues that an attack on Iran's facilities would galvanize the Iranian
[02:49:23.560 --> 02:49:26.960]  public behind the leadership of president Mach Moudad Denizad and give
[02:49:26.960 --> 02:49:30.680]  the regime and Tehran more support for a rationale for developing nuclear
[02:49:30.680 --> 02:49:35.520]  capabilities an Iranian administration under attack would experience
[02:49:35.520 --> 02:49:38.960]  considerable national unity and would work rapidly to develop its weapons
[02:49:38.960 --> 02:49:44.640]  programs withdrawing from the non-proliferation treaty and prioritizing
[02:49:44.640 --> 02:49:47.000]  nuclear weapons the report says they've already tried to have a peaceful
[02:49:47.000 --> 02:49:51.320]  program and had the uranium enriched by the West with the globalists said no
[02:49:51.320 --> 02:49:56.720]  continuing the U.S. paid Iranian nuclear scientists the Washington Post reports
[02:49:56.720 --> 02:50:02.760]  five million for aid to CIA basically a payoff to lie for them Iranian nuclear
[02:50:02.760 --> 02:50:06.000]  scientists returns home to a hero's welcome and Iranian nuclear scientists
[02:50:06.000 --> 02:50:10.400]  at the center of a bizarre espionage drama arrived here to a hero's welcome
