[00:38.560 --> 00:42.960]  news channel five story Tennessee becomes first state to fight terrorism
[00:42.960 --> 00:49.440]  statewide the TSA rolls out checkpoints on the highways now Homeland Security
[00:49.440 --> 00:53.520]  already did this two years ago it's in my film police state for the rise of
[00:53.520 --> 00:58.860]  FEMA and TSA was involved in that but I've always told you we're gonna have
[00:58.860 --> 01:05.340]  domestic checkpoints just like the over a hundred they have inside the United
[01:05.340 --> 01:11.300]  States under federal regulations up to a hundred miles inside I went back through
[01:11.300 --> 01:15.320]  one of these again yesterday and it was explosive I'm gonna be airing that
[01:15.320 --> 01:20.820]  tonight on the nightly news I just got into the office an hour or so ago and
[01:20.820 --> 01:25.080]  they're getting that video off my camera I really got in their face this time
[01:25.080 --> 01:29.240]  and I told them that the government or drug dealers and criminals and that I
[01:29.240 --> 01:35.720]  don't respect their their unconstitutional activity and I just
[01:35.720 --> 01:39.520]  really can't take it anymore I'm getting where I can't handle it anymore I mean
[01:39.520 --> 01:44.920]  the flying the naked body scanners the the groping the TSA at high school
[01:44.920 --> 01:52.360]  proms in New Mexico and and and and now this headline I hadn't even seen this
[01:52.360 --> 01:59.160]  it's up at drudgereport.com drudge also is linked to the report that we posted
[01:59.160 --> 02:05.760]  at info wars.com that Paul Watson did with the headline that State
[02:05.760 --> 02:09.840]  Department sends in one of the leaders of the Arab Spring from Egypt to run
[02:09.840 --> 02:15.560]  Occupy Wall Street it is CIA State Department Obama run that doesn't mean
[02:15.560 --> 02:18.400]  the people that showed up for it are bad there are there's a lot of corruption
[02:18.400 --> 02:22.400]  on Wall Street that is where most the problems are emanating from but not
[02:22.400 --> 02:26.480]  Wall Street itself generally but the actual private fellow reserve that
[02:26.480 --> 02:32.080]  report is up at drudgereport.com as well but it's just the nightmare just keeps
[02:32.080 --> 02:37.000]  coming more and more true here the nightmare just continues to intensify
[02:37.000 --> 02:44.200]  and we are going into an authoritarian nightmare and I personally am beyond
[02:44.200 --> 02:51.440]  disgusted beyond angry beyond rage right now it's in the news what already came
[02:51.440 --> 02:55.280]  out last year that Homeland Security arrestee legals in these fake stings and
[02:55.280 --> 03:00.760]  then releases them with green cards that they've frozen all major deportations
[03:00.760 --> 03:07.800]  of Mexicans not of other groups including criminals and that's back in the
[03:07.800 --> 03:12.160]  news today and then meanwhile I pull up and they're waving everybody through
[03:12.160 --> 03:15.800]  but they want to search my car and I've got to tell the Border Patrol I'm gonna
[03:15.800 --> 03:21.360]  have to sue you and this is 98 miles inside the US and I'm not against the
[03:21.360 --> 03:25.720]  individual Border Patrol people but I literally have to have this stand down
[03:25.720 --> 03:30.600]  this standoff with them when I get in their face and where my kids are
[03:30.600 --> 03:34.440]  sitting there watching this and then they tell me to go I mean they had like
[03:34.440 --> 03:38.160]  six of them slime over they said pull over there we're gonna search you and I
[03:38.160 --> 03:48.800]  said I'm gonna sue you you come on here and violate my fourth amendment and you
[03:48.800 --> 03:52.560]  know the Supreme Court is ruled they can have these checkpoints 100 miles in to
[03:52.560 --> 03:57.360]  check immigration status and I believe that's unconstitutional besides the
[03:57.360 --> 04:00.400]  globalist don't want to check immigration status I mean the Homeland Security's
[04:00.400 --> 04:03.520]  been caught hiring you legals to build part of the Texas border fence that's
[04:03.520 --> 04:11.800]  for show that's on record associated press Fox news but they can't do it for
[04:11.800 --> 04:15.960]  drugs and they were sticking having people open their doors stick the drug
[04:15.960 --> 04:24.120]  dog in this is 98 miles inside the US inside South Texas and they said pull
[04:24.120 --> 04:29.400]  over there we're coming on board I said look where you as citizens you can run
[04:29.400 --> 04:34.560]  the plates of this vehicle I said if I was from Mexico I'm the best actor in
[04:34.560 --> 04:38.720]  the world basically and I said you're not gonna search my vehicle with that
[04:38.720 --> 04:42.240]  drug dog I said besides the government and the Border Patrol been caught
[04:42.240 --> 04:47.240]  bringing drugs in here they all smile and then my wife got in their face it
[04:47.240 --> 04:54.560]  was just not even emotionally draining I have such clarity now that it's pure
[04:54.560 --> 05:02.000]  torture to have this level of understanding hold your eye back hundreds
[05:02.000 --> 05:06.320]  of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone this is our last
[05:06.320 --> 05:11.360]  chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this agenda that we're
[05:11.360 --> 05:14.960]  pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home I have tremendous
[05:14.960 --> 05:20.000]  influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the shots I
[05:20.000 --> 05:25.400]  think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention for
[05:25.400 --> 05:30.320]  the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel
[05:30.320 --> 05:34.720]  hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world
[05:34.720 --> 05:38.440]  government Tim Geithner Bernanke the arsonists they're asking for more
[05:38.440 --> 05:42.400]  matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the checkout to today seems
[05:42.400 --> 05:47.920]  like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of
[05:47.920 --> 05:53.640]  the Republic get your copy of full of the Republic on DVD at info wars dot com

[07:04.120 --> 07:08.280]  number one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric
[07:08.280 --> 07:12.600]  bill number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your
[07:12.600 --> 07:16.560]  electric company allows you to have it's true total government control of
[07:16.560 --> 07:20.920]  electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three in
[07:20.920 --> 07:25.260]  some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new
[07:25.260 --> 07:29.040]  socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[07:29.040 --> 07:33.120]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[07:33.120 --> 07:37.120]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power
[07:37.120 --> 07:40.920]  generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I
[07:40.920 --> 07:43.640]  really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from
[07:43.640 --> 07:48.920]  science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at www.mysolar
[07:48.920 --> 07:53.040]  backup dot com that's my solar backup dot com remember the government doesn't

[07:59.800 --> 08:05.320]  and this is communications radio network probably presents the Alex Jones show
[08:05.320 --> 08:09.960]  because there's a war on for your mind
[08:13.080 --> 08:18.040]  all right ladies and gentlemen thank you so much for joining us on this
[08:18.040 --> 08:24.400]  Thursday 20th day of October 2011 transmission Wayne Madsen who's recently
[08:24.400 --> 08:29.160]  been inside Libya investigative journalist will be joining us coming up
[08:29.160 --> 08:34.720]  about 25 minutes from now to break down the report that Muammar Gaddafi has
[08:34.720 --> 08:41.800]  been killed hiding in a spider-hold John B. Wells syndicated radio host for
[08:41.800 --> 08:46.000]  coast to coast AM who covers a lot of the same issues that we get into with a
[08:46.000 --> 08:50.680]  great eloquence will be joining us for 50 minutes of the second hour
[08:50.680 --> 08:54.920]  Webster Tarpoli was on yesterday will pop in because he's recently been to
[08:54.920 --> 08:59.720]  Libya to give us his take on this latest Muammar Gaddafi report and I'm also
[08:59.720 --> 09:05.520]  gonna get a 10-minute pop in from Steve Pachennick because again he called us up
[09:05.520 --> 09:09.080]  this morning and saying he thinks it's staged and has some sources we'll just
[09:09.080 --> 09:14.840]  get about a 10-minute pop in from him and Tarpoli coming up here on the
[09:14.840 --> 09:23.520]  broadcast today now also coming up at least on nightly news tonight I may air
[09:23.520 --> 09:28.920]  it if do has time to get it off my camera and loaded I've got a blur out my
[09:28.920 --> 09:35.200]  children's faces and their names and things I went to the south Texas beach a
[09:35.200 --> 09:41.040]  few weeks ago over the weekend drove back 98 miles inside the US and they're
[09:41.040 --> 09:44.400]  now building more of these there's over a hundred in the country there's more
[09:44.400 --> 09:51.720]  than 15 in Texas and they wanted to search her car with a drug dog and I
[09:51.720 --> 09:55.400]  told them no and I said you you guys let the illegal aliens through these
[09:55.400 --> 10:00.160]  checkpoints and their own record doing that in fact C&S news has a report out
[10:00.160 --> 10:07.840]  today where Janet Napolitano is giving illegals green cards when they do
[10:07.840 --> 10:10.880]  arrest them and of course that's come out for three years they're doing that
[10:10.880 --> 10:15.840]  they've stopped basically all deportations of Mexicans because that's a
[10:15.840 --> 10:22.840]  political client state now and I guess a Democratic voters others Salvadorans
[10:22.840 --> 10:27.720]  and others are being shipped out of the country in fact they've got a big Bayview
[10:27.720 --> 10:33.360]  detention center down there by South Padre it's got 5,000 Salvadorans people
[10:33.360 --> 10:38.320]  from El Salvador in it so it's also very discriminatory but there's a globalist
[10:38.320 --> 10:44.160]  deal with Mexico to basically merge the two countries it also came out in the
[10:44.160 --> 10:49.400]  McAllen newspaper after talk radio covered it after Glenn Beck did that the
[10:49.400 --> 10:53.600]  children are taught to pledge allegiance to Mexico and to salute the Mexican flag
[10:53.600 --> 10:59.200]  this goes on all over the United States in any school that's 30 or 40% Hispanic
[10:59.200 --> 11:02.640]  including Puerto Rican schools schools that are predominantly Puerto Rican
[11:02.640 --> 11:07.120]  Puerto Ricans have complained about it this is not a new phenomenon they say
[11:07.120 --> 11:11.040]  well we're not Mexican not nothing wrong with being Mexican but you know the the
[11:11.040 --> 11:15.560]  Ford Foundation has said if you've got brown skin and or Latino you are now a
[11:15.560 --> 11:19.440]  Mexican because that's that's the political decision they want to play
[11:19.440 --> 11:25.240]  those groups off against each other and so that's why I get so angry 98 miles
[11:25.240 --> 11:30.680]  into the US I've never left the country on the trip and I pull up with my family
[11:30.680 --> 11:37.040]  and everybody on board US citizens and you got a bunch of people with blue eyes
[11:37.040 --> 11:43.040]  and blonde and brown hair speaking complete Texas accents going yeah we're
[11:43.040 --> 11:47.640]  US citizens they go pull over we're searching and I'm like listen I'm gonna
[11:47.640 --> 11:54.040]  sue you okay you come on here without a warrant and then they send over six
[11:54.040 --> 11:57.200]  goons open the door up and I explain I go the government's been caught dealing
[11:57.200 --> 12:02.880]  drugs including the Border Patrol and I and I said and he said the Supreme
[12:02.880 --> 12:07.480]  Court's rule we can do this and I said it's ruled a hundred miles in you can and
[12:07.480 --> 12:12.120]  I believe it's a false ruling but it's ruled that that you can ask
[12:12.120 --> 12:17.720]  immigration status you can ask if I'm a citizen or not but I said you're
[12:17.720 --> 12:22.960]  searching for drugs he said no we're not we're searching for narcotics and I
[12:22.960 --> 12:26.640]  looked at the guy because they know they're they're they're outside the law
[12:26.640 --> 12:32.680]  and I said I said you come on here I'm gonna you know gonna sue you pal that's
[12:32.680 --> 12:38.440]  how I do not give consent the reason I got so mad yesterday last time I had my
[12:38.440 --> 12:42.880]  camera going as we pulled up and they said turn that off and I said no you're
[12:42.880 --> 12:53.640]  surveilling me free speech first amendment and then they came over and
[12:53.640 --> 12:58.880]  and and then they just out in the door of the RV we were on the Info Wars mobile
[12:58.880 --> 13:03.080]  and I I talked to the guy he said you can go ahead and go this time six of them
[13:03.080 --> 13:07.040]  come over after they've ordered us to pull over and they all kind of swagger
[13:07.040 --> 13:13.880]  over to open the door I'm getting their face with righteous indignation and this
[13:13.880 --> 13:19.200]  time I didn't hold a camera up this time you don't see the camera until I mean
[13:19.200 --> 13:23.240]  I've got it down in my lap until they start saying no we're gonna search your
[13:23.240 --> 13:29.200]  vehicle we're coming aboard and that's when I get the camera out getting their
[13:29.200 --> 13:38.080]  face and look look this is a planned takedown of America the globalist always
[13:38.080 --> 13:42.640]  use the crisis they create 800 plus sanctuary cities free tuition free
[13:42.640 --> 13:47.440]  welfare above the law don't get arrested for DWI don't get arrested for no
[13:47.440 --> 13:51.520]  insurance get different banking rules that's even been in the associated
[13:51.520 --> 13:55.240]  press that the illegals get different banking rules and citizens it's an
[13:55.240 --> 13:59.840]  incentive to bring them here then turn them into a political group that will
[13:59.840 --> 14:08.080]  vote for gun control open borders basic globalism and then as citizens of this
[14:08.080 --> 14:14.280]  country see what's happening and get upset by it then the system comes in and
[14:14.280 --> 14:22.080]  says that's okay we will set up checkpoints everywhere in a police state
[14:22.080 --> 14:27.800]  and then have a few show a rest every year and then release the illegal aliens
[14:27.800 --> 14:31.920]  out the back door I mean this is all on record and there's six and a half plus
[14:31.920 --> 14:36.400]  billion people that want to come here I mean could we take them all maybe if we
[14:36.400 --> 14:42.920]  didn't have welfare but these groups do on average get on welfare the dad goes
[14:42.920 --> 14:47.040]  out and works but mama on two or three different identification cards gets on
[14:47.040 --> 14:51.640]  welfare that's why around Texas you can tell the illegal aliens when you see
[14:51.640 --> 14:55.960]  them because they got a western wear dress don't speak English got the
[14:55.960 --> 14:59.200]  rosas tickers all over their cars and they're driving vehicles nicer than
[14:59.200 --> 15:03.200]  citizens are because they're not paying taxes on average mama's on three forms
[15:03.200 --> 15:07.720]  of welfare and daddy's out there working hard all day and the babies are free at
[15:07.720 --> 15:12.000]  the hospital everything's free and citizens no matter what color you are
[15:12.000 --> 15:17.400]  are subsidizing it California's bankrupt 48 states are bankrupt the
[15:17.400 --> 15:22.560]  country's going down right now we're in a stalled depression Mexico has been
[15:22.560 --> 15:26.120]  imploded by the globalist which is designed to then drive them all up here
[15:26.120 --> 15:30.840]  this has all been designed nobody's bad in this except the globalist I don't
[15:30.840 --> 15:34.120]  blame Mexicans for wanting to come up here especially now that it's a
[15:34.120 --> 15:40.400]  genocidal mad max world literally down in Mexico and that's how Mexican citizens
[15:40.400 --> 15:44.400]  were describing it to me the five days I was down at the coast doing an
[15:44.400 --> 15:49.720]  investigation that's what Hispanic Texans told me that's what white and
[15:49.720 --> 15:54.560]  black Texans all told me and they were all scared to talk on the radio except
[15:54.560 --> 15:59.000]  one gentleman he completely concurred a Hispanic gentleman who we had on a few
[15:59.000 --> 16:04.640]  days ago and a veteran as well and a lot of the stuff he told me off record he
[16:04.640 --> 16:08.320]  didn't repeat on air it's just it's just it's because then you be able to they'd
[16:08.320 --> 16:11.880]  be able to tell who he was and people are living in fear down there I'm gonna
[16:11.880 --> 16:15.720]  get into the whole Gaddafi thing here in just a moment we'll spend a lot of time
[16:15.720 --> 16:21.520]  on that today but you know here's what I'm talking about every time this happens
[16:21.520 --> 16:25.320]  you're always told it's the first time it's happened this is not the first time
[16:25.320 --> 16:31.600]  it's happened it is in Tennessee and a surrounding four state area that this
[16:31.600 --> 16:36.880]  happened in 2009 it's in my film police state for the rise of FEMA I had the
[16:36.880 --> 16:44.000]  state rep on the governor put out a statement they had 14 federal agencies
[16:44.000 --> 16:49.360]  this was in the newspapers 14 federal agencies setting up checkpoints on major

[24:41.040 --> 24:48.280]  winner launching wars in Uganda Chad Libya saying days not weeks we have all
[24:48.280 --> 24:53.920]  over the United States people getting on buses trains aircraft and now
[24:53.920 --> 24:57.760]  highways and you drive up you sit there for an hour and you get there and
[24:57.760 --> 25:01.920]  there's state police with TSA directing them and they jerk you out of your car
[25:01.920 --> 25:08.880]  and now put their hands on your body in fact yesterday pulling up the thing I
[25:08.880 --> 25:13.440]  saw I'm pulling over some cars and getting people out and I just can't
[25:13.440 --> 25:19.320]  handle it anymore because I I can't take it anymore I mean it's so as tonight
[25:19.320 --> 25:26.160]  it's come out in federal court that the border patrol was ordered by the FBI DEA
[25:26.160 --> 25:47.320]  and others to allow drugs to come in to the United States and guns to go into
[25:47.320 --> 25:54.160]  Mexico any is that saying the average war patrol agent is a bad person no but
[25:54.160 --> 26:01.920]  they're not even allowed to do their job it's all just show it's all just show and
[26:03.040 --> 26:10.560]  it's all about having a pretext to train the public to pull up to checkpoints
[26:10.560 --> 26:18.040]  and to have your car torn apart and drug dogs on board and the way they look at
[26:18.040 --> 26:21.860]  you and I was watching this video out of Tennessee where they're running
[26:21.860 --> 26:25.360]  checkpoints searching people just randomly on the highway with TSA in
[26:25.360 --> 26:29.760]  command and you see the state police you know their eyes all slit looking at you
[26:29.760 --> 26:34.080]  how about you how about you be under suspicion as the founding fathers said
[26:34.080 --> 26:40.240]  is the number one danger big government a fearful master a dangerous
[26:40.240 --> 26:45.120]  servant a fearful master like fire how about you how about you being the
[26:45.120 --> 26:49.280]  danger pulling up people in uniforms with slit eyes you're looking at you all
[26:49.280 --> 26:54.800]  with their eyes all you know angry at you just just squinting their eyes like
[26:54.800 --> 27:02.280]  like like they're the good guy and some Western and you're the bad guy
[27:03.840 --> 27:07.720]  they're Clint Eastwood you're the bad guy no you're not the bad guy you're
[27:07.720 --> 27:11.080]  your family going to church or going to work or trying to get down the road to
[27:11.080 --> 27:15.560]  see grandma and you pull up there's a bunch of government crooks violating the
[27:15.560 --> 27:20.440]  Billorites and Constitution waddling around destroying America stabbing it
[27:20.440 --> 27:25.080]  in the heart looking at you like you're bad when this entire government is up
[27:25.080 --> 27:29.160]  to its eyeballs and drug dealing and money laundering this stinking criminal
[27:29.160 --> 27:33.960]  government made drugs illegal to explode the amount of people using it to put
[27:33.960 --> 27:39.440]  money into it to corrupt the society and I'm sick of a bunch of known drug
[27:39.440 --> 27:44.360]  dealing criminals state police all over the country pulling people over stealing
[27:44.360 --> 27:49.440]  their money I'm tired of it I'm tired of the asset forager all of it I'm calling
[27:49.440 --> 27:53.920]  the whole system out I'm done I can't take it anymore everything we said is
[27:53.920 --> 27:57.280]  true it's all coming true it's all happening and it's only going to get
[27:57.280 --> 28:03.200]  worse from here they're setting up a red terror in this country of control and
[28:03.200 --> 28:06.120]  I'm not saying all the board of patrol are bad of the average cops bad I know
[28:06.120 --> 28:09.760]  most of you aren't bad but you better stand up and say no to this this is
[28:09.760 --> 28:17.560]  classical tyranny staring us in the face there's no room for denial anymore and
[28:17.560 --> 28:21.600]  the thought and the funny thing is I wasn't even disgusted or even so much
[28:21.600 --> 28:27.040]  angry I was beyond it I was like looking at little children in their little
[28:27.040 --> 28:31.560]  uniforms waddling around their power trips and as soon as I looked at them
[28:31.560 --> 28:35.560]  with disgust and disdain they were melting like little babies before me
[28:35.560 --> 28:42.400]  which is even scarier their little boys in dress up pulling a family over
[28:42.400 --> 28:46.920]  pretending that they're trying to keep America safe you aren't allowed to keep
[28:46.920 --> 28:51.720]  America safe you work for the criminals it doesn't matter if you're good or bad
[28:51.720 --> 28:57.280]  you work for criminals this government is illegitimate and hijacked and far and

[29:05.360 --> 29:08.720]  of the day it's a distraction from what's happening economically in Europe
[29:08.720 --> 29:13.200]  God help us and you know how bad this depression is gonna get why do you think
[29:13.200 --> 29:16.840]  they're turning on all the checkpoints all over the country right now and the
[29:16.840 --> 29:21.200]  secret police and the CIA is coming out admitting that they're federalizing local
[29:21.200 --> 29:27.440]  police departments totally illegal they are gonna turn the resources off in this
[29:27.440 --> 29:33.280]  country and I'm gonna tell you right now Mitt Romney Herman Kane Rick Perry

[33:09.400 --> 33:24.680]  okay ladies and gentlemen if you want my view on the whole Muammar
[33:24.680 --> 33:32.880]  Gaddafi situation it's this with Ben Laden we knew he had kidney failure ten
[33:32.880 --> 33:37.600]  years ago or more we know he was at the American hospital visited by the CIA
[33:37.600 --> 33:46.440]  CBS News LaFigaro of France we know that his family was awarded giant contracts
[33:46.440 --> 33:50.440]  for US military bases the largest construction firm in the Middle East
[33:50.440 --> 33:55.840]  bin Laden construction they're the folks that air conditioned Mecca you know to
[33:55.840 --> 33:59.840]  to give you my view on this Gaddafi thing I have to first give you some
[33:59.840 --> 34:05.720]  history and bottom line to simplify it is this the bin Laden thing was fake
[34:05.720 --> 34:09.440]  because we know bin Laden was already dead from scores of credible sources
[34:09.440 --> 34:13.280]  including Madeleine Albright who came out and told Bush don't roll him out
[34:13.280 --> 34:17.800]  dead we know you've got him on ice Walter Cronkite you don't get more
[34:17.800 --> 34:22.600]  insider than that he played footsie with the Rothschilds Rockefellers most
[34:22.600 --> 34:26.480]  elite encampment Bohemian Grove Bilderberg you name it he came out right
[34:26.480 --> 34:29.760]  before the before election and said don't bring him out I had Bush
[34:29.760 --> 34:33.480]  administration official sources I had Steve Pachennik council on farm
[34:33.480 --> 34:41.000]  relations back at the time saying it was all staged in 2002 so that we knew was
[34:41.000 --> 34:45.840]  fake and we said fake situation room photo not live video feeds throwing the
[34:45.840 --> 34:49.760]  body in the water the way they had the media all ready to go with it and
[34:49.760 --> 34:55.480]  Obama making the announcement that's when you know something's fake that was
[34:55.480 --> 35:02.080]  fake I don't know about this the video has the customary super shaky and then
[35:02.080 --> 35:09.800]  there's one video still that they cut to we're rolling the video right now this
[35:09.800 --> 35:16.960]  person's either the worst camera person in the known galaxy or this is a staged
[35:16.960 --> 35:21.000]  video and we've seen stage videos out of Iran of the young woman shot and
[35:21.000 --> 35:25.120]  bleeding to death that was fake we've seen fake bin Laden videos the point is
[35:25.120 --> 35:29.200]  when you have a government in a NATO system that lies incessantly you don't
[35:29.200 --> 35:32.720]  know what the truth is it's like if you have a neighbor or somebody in business
[35:32.720 --> 35:38.600]  you've worked with who lies most the time you you you never know so it's not
[35:38.600 --> 35:47.000]  bad to question this in fact you should but knowing his psychology knowing where
[35:47.000 --> 35:51.400]  he most likely would be in his hometown knowing about the month and a half long
[35:51.400 --> 35:55.880]  siege they claim they killed him before or he ran to Venezuela they claim they
[35:55.880 --> 36:00.560]  killed his sons over and over again that wasn't true they trim they they claim
[36:00.560 --> 36:04.640]  they killed his firstborn the shield of Islam that's how it translates and they
[36:04.640 --> 36:10.640]  hadn't show I'd say 60 40 my gut my gut says that's probably Gaddafi he's
[36:10.640 --> 36:17.720]  probably dead just knowing the MO staying fighting seven months against the
[36:17.720 --> 36:23.760]  Al Qaeda rebels it's kind of like you know he's the ugly they're the bad much
[36:23.760 --> 36:26.800]  think it off he's a good guy but it's good the bad the ugly and the people
[36:26.800 --> 36:31.160]  running our country certainly aren't the good and Al Qaeda certainly in the good
[36:31.160 --> 36:37.080]  or the ugly they're the bad so is Saudi Arabia there's no doubting I'll take
[36:37.080 --> 36:41.680]  Gaddafi any day over Saudi Arabia and the unspeakable decadence and evil and
[36:41.680 --> 36:49.160]  British intelligence model they use it's true that he was a dictator it's true
[36:49.160 --> 36:52.960]  he bucked the system it's true he was building up all of Africa it's true the
[36:52.960 --> 36:56.600]  guy lived in a little tent with plastic chairs well everybody thought he was
[36:56.600 --> 37:00.760]  behind his armored compound that's why they wanted to get rid of him and now
[37:00.760 --> 37:03.600]  they're going to bring in the forced inoculations they're going to cut off
[37:03.600 --> 37:08.960]  the water supply the austerity they have blood Al Qaeda in control they say
[37:08.960 --> 37:13.240]  thousands upwards of 10,000 different types of missiles several thousand
[37:13.240 --> 37:18.240]  shoulder launched have fallen into the hands of Al Qaeda think about this put
[37:18.240 --> 37:26.800]  Al Qaeda in charge of Libya call them freedom fighters have the Facebook guy
[37:26.800 --> 37:31.360]  that ran the Arab Spring in Egypt overthrowing the old dictator Mubarak
[37:31.360 --> 37:36.080]  bringing in something far worse now and then he's now running with the CIA and
[37:36.080 --> 37:39.400]  State Department the Occupy Wall Street situation I want to get Wayne Madsen's
[37:39.400 --> 37:42.920]  take on that from Wayne Madsen report.com but I wanted to give you my
[37:42.920 --> 37:47.880]  preface first I don't know what's going on here people say tell us Alex I don't
[37:47.880 --> 37:53.960]  know learning to judge from videos they can fake almost anything the
[37:53.960 --> 37:59.080]  mutalib video it was obviously fake with a hood over it they just projected his
[37:59.080 --> 38:02.920]  head in and had him turn that was clearly a fake the bin Laden videos turned
[38:02.920 --> 38:06.440]  out to be fake I could look at them and tell you they were fakes one of them was
[38:06.440 --> 38:09.960]  a standard computer-generated dummy model that you can get an even cheap
[38:09.960 --> 38:15.200]  programs that was later confirmed with voice print and video analysis to be
[38:15.200 --> 38:20.240]  faked by major universities this video just looking at it with the eye looks
[38:20.240 --> 38:25.200]  real but their CG is getting better they could have already killed him
[38:25.200 --> 38:29.000]  somewhere else and just want to release this we don't know he could have run to
[38:29.000 --> 38:32.420]  Uganda and that's why special forces went in there then they drug his body
[38:32.420 --> 38:36.360]  back we got Pechenik popping in later for 10 minutes on this we got
[38:36.360 --> 38:41.040]  Tarpley popping in for 15 20 minutes or so we have an article up at prison
[38:41.040 --> 38:45.800]  planet calm right now killing Gaddafi spares international criminal court
[38:45.800 --> 38:50.960]  embarrassment for U.S. and Britain like Milajevic Gaddafi would have thrust
[38:50.960 --> 38:58.560]  Western support for Al Qaeda fighters under the spotlight now one one reason I
[38:58.560 --> 39:02.920]  into this whole intelligence mix that I think it could be staged but my gut
[39:02.920 --> 39:09.520]  says probably not and my guts frankly never wrong but we have to leave it open
[39:09.520 --> 39:14.160]  is that you notice Europe didn't go along with the total private banker
[39:14.160 --> 39:18.680]  takeover and the end of all sovereignty being held hostage by the banksters they
[39:18.680 --> 39:23.280]  didn't do that today so all Hades is breaking loose there major states are
[39:23.280 --> 39:27.180]  banning cash sales like Louisiana there's a lot of big police state
[39:27.180 --> 39:30.760]  developments checkpoints are popping up nationwide right now we're going into
[39:30.760 --> 39:34.960]  another degree of martial law so all this is happening and that's coming up
[39:34.960 --> 39:39.200]  we're busy looking at Gaddafi now a man who's been brave enough this year to be
[39:39.200 --> 39:43.280]  there Tarpleys also was there just a few months ago under bombardment is Wayne
[39:43.280 --> 39:48.320]  Madsen and Wayne Madsen report calm and he joins us to give us his first look
[39:48.320 --> 39:53.000]  analysis of this Gaddafi situation I haven't gotten your view yet Wayne you
[39:53.000 --> 40:00.760]  just heard my first look analysis what's your take as a former NSA analyst Navy
[40:00.760 --> 40:04.440]  submarine warfare expert top journalists reporting for some of the biggest
[40:04.440 --> 40:09.720]  publications in the world on Capitol Hill is somebody that tracks what these
[40:09.720 --> 40:14.280]  what these disinfo people do what's your gut level first look analysis Wayne
[40:14.280 --> 40:20.080]  Madsen well I also agree with you Alex I I think although it's too soon to tell
[40:20.080 --> 40:24.920]  and because we've been in a data with all this disinformation before curveball
[40:24.920 --> 40:31.680]  yellow cake uranium all these other fakes you know riots in Syria that were
[40:31.680 --> 40:36.520]  actually riot riots and Bahrain the fact that Al Jazeera was the first to
[40:36.520 --> 40:40.880]  report this we know about their ties to the government of Qatar and what they've
[40:40.880 --> 40:46.560]  done with the CIA in the past my gut feeling says he's dead but I also would
[40:46.560 --> 40:51.480]  point out the initial reports were that he was shot in the legs there was one
[40:51.480 --> 40:56.400]  photo I saw clearly of a head wound it could be that he did try to maybe
[40:56.400 --> 41:01.160]  surrender maybe they executed him doesn't say a whole lot for Obama's wall
[41:01.160 --> 41:05.320]  the jungle foreign policy because that's what it is it's no different than
[41:05.320 --> 41:11.120]  bushes when when they we killed Saddam Hussein's two sons and in a very
[41:11.120 --> 41:18.640]  macabre scene we we saw them laid out on on some slabs later we saw the photo
[41:18.640 --> 41:24.400]  purportedly of Saddam Hussein after he was executed he still maintained he was
[41:24.400 --> 41:29.560]  president of Iraq Gaddafi still maintain that he was the leader of Libya I would
[41:29.560 --> 41:35.080]  say that as with Saddam Hussein the situation with Gaddafi President Obama
[41:35.080 --> 41:41.000]  has violated executive order one two three three three which was initiated by
[41:41.000 --> 41:46.120]  president Ford signed off by Jimmy Carter Ronald Reagan and even the first
[41:46.120 --> 41:53.200]  president Bush George HW Bush he's violated that he has assisted in the
[41:53.200 --> 41:57.960]  assassination of a foreign head of state and mr. Obama should be basically
[41:57.960 --> 42:01.920]  indicted by the House Judiciary Committee that's called impeachment he
[42:01.920 --> 42:08.360]  should go before the Senate and he should be tried well they they they sell
[42:08.360 --> 42:12.720]  these great evils in the name of well we did this to somebody who's unpopular
[42:12.720 --> 42:17.160]  but that's how Hitler started what he did and every other tyrant has led
[42:17.160 --> 42:24.560]  nations into total tyranny down this primrose path but but but again knowing
[42:24.560 --> 42:28.400]  Gaddafi saying he was going to stay and fight to the end getting his family out
[42:28.400 --> 42:32.880]  following that line of reasoning he probably fought to the death they're
[42:32.880 --> 42:37.400]  just claiming he tried to surrender in the first reports so that they don't
[42:37.400 --> 42:42.040]  make him look like even more of a John Wayne type martyr to the people there
[42:42.040 --> 42:46.440]  but I think undoubtedly now this is going to make him a martyr whether it's
[42:46.440 --> 42:51.120]  true or not my gut tells me it is with these thousands of data points coming
[42:51.120 --> 42:57.320]  in right you know we had that other situation initially the rebel movement
[42:57.320 --> 43:00.680]  the new government of Libya said that they were going to take his body to a
[43:00.680 --> 43:04.840]  secret location because they didn't want a shrine they didn't want a memorial
[43:04.840 --> 43:09.360]  where his followers would would flock to that again here we have the same
[43:09.360 --> 43:13.280]  situation with bin Laden what are they going to do dispose of the body
[43:13.280 --> 43:17.360]  somewhere we'll never know where it is we'll never have any kind of independent
[43:17.360 --> 43:23.480]  means to verify that in fact he was he was killed and how he was killed I mean
[43:23.480 --> 43:27.640]  this is done in any murder situation in this country there are autopsies done
[43:27.640 --> 43:33.080]  there are medical examiners that issue a report we don't have that situation
[43:33.080 --> 43:38.400]  probably in this case and that's going to just open up more more and I hate to
[43:38.400 --> 43:42.080]  say the word conspiracy theories because the government that will allow
[43:42.080 --> 43:46.080]  themselves to be charged with these conspiracy theories because they are
[43:46.080 --> 43:49.360]  not forthcoming with the truth well that's another good point I'm glad you
[43:49.360 --> 43:53.680]  raised that and that just adds to the suspicion that it could be staged or
[43:53.680 --> 43:58.040]  they killed him in Uganda or something we know special forces were seen just
[43:58.040 --> 44:03.120]  last week Gaddafi body being taken to secret location Reuters reports still
[44:03.120 --> 44:06.760]  Western media has not confirmed any of this they're just going off what the
[44:06.760 --> 44:11.440]  famously unreliable Al Qaeda people are saying the body of deposed Libyan leader
[44:11.440 --> 44:14.840]  Muammar Gaddafi is being taken to location which has been kept secret for
[44:14.840 --> 44:20.080]  security reasons a national transportation transnational council official said
[44:20.080 --> 44:24.080]  today could have he died of wounds suffered Thursday as fighters battling
[44:24.080 --> 44:28.640]  to complete an eight-month-old uprising against the rule overran his hometown
[44:28.640 --> 44:36.360]  of cert Libya's interim ruler said Gaddafi's body is with our own unit in a
[44:36.360 --> 44:40.520]  car we're taking the body to a secret place for security reasons
[44:40.520 --> 44:48.200]  Mohammed Abdel coffee an NTC official official Al Qaeda person said in the
[44:48.200 --> 44:53.280]  city of Miss Rada told Reuters you've you've been to Libya repeatedly you've
[44:53.280 --> 44:59.160]  seen the breakdown here I mean even if they really did kill him which I'm
[44:59.160 --> 45:03.960]  leaning towards then just letting his body disappear or this made up burial at
[45:03.960 --> 45:08.800]  sea sleeps with the fishes that way they can never really charge anybody or say
[45:08.800 --> 45:14.680]  who really killed him and then basically not have war crimes be brought up
[45:14.680 --> 45:20.880]  here well exactly and also gets people like Obama and David Cameron and
[45:20.880 --> 45:25.480]  Nicholas Sarkozy off the hook as far as state-sponsored assassination which is
[45:25.480 --> 45:30.680]  still illegal in this country and it has been since the 1970s when the
[45:30.680 --> 45:35.320]  executive order was instituted because of the CIA's rolling assassination of
[45:35.320 --> 45:39.400]  Chilean President Salvador Allende and President Trujillo the Dominican
[45:39.400 --> 45:43.560]  Republic and President Jim of South Vietnam and others that's why the law
[45:43.560 --> 45:48.520]  was instituted and I say that the Congress now has to whether you like
[45:48.520 --> 45:52.720]  Gaddafi or not most people he's not you know he wasn't an endearing figure the
[45:52.720 --> 45:56.720]  other thing I want to point out when when Mr. Obama was in South Chicago in
[45:56.720 --> 46:01.480]  the 1980s spying on the nation of Islam and the Black Panthers and the
[46:01.480 --> 46:06.240]  Alrucan gang one of the things he was looking at was those movements those
[46:06.240 --> 46:10.720]  black social movements getting support from Gaddafi I would I would also
[46:10.720 --> 46:15.240]  suggest that this was a vendetta by Obama that goes back to when he was
[46:15.240 --> 46:20.040]  working for the CIA in Chicago in the 1980s and he has his fingerprints all
[46:20.040 --> 46:24.760]  over the death of Gaddafi I believe he ordered it I believe he was settling old
[46:24.760 --> 46:29.640]  scores and this is exactly what the executive order was one of the things
[46:29.640 --> 46:34.120]  that was supposed to prevent people like Nixon settling scores with people he
[46:34.120 --> 46:38.720]  didn't like overseas and LBJ or domestic I mean now they're saying they'll kill
[46:38.720 --> 46:43.720]  US citizens no judge no jury anytime they want including in America we have
[46:43.720 --> 46:49.200]  Reuters reporting and UPI five years ago when Israel said we'll kill US citizens
[46:49.200 --> 46:55.160]  inside the US and our own government said come on in so now I guess US
[46:55.160 --> 46:59.960]  citizens are basically according to the globalist the lowest form of filth right
[46:59.960 --> 47:04.400]  and the one thing I would point out you Obama sending troops to Uganda it's
[47:04.400 --> 47:08.360]  quite clear that Sudan what remains of that country is next on the target list
[47:08.360 --> 47:12.800]  Omar Bashir the president of that country he's got an international criminal
[47:12.800 --> 47:18.280]  court warrant against him and you know I mean who is next who's next whether
[47:18.280 --> 47:23.080]  these guys are elected or not they are the heads of state it's illegal for US
[47:23.080 --> 47:27.400]  presidents to involve themselves in it in their assassination so I say start
[47:27.400 --> 47:33.400]  with this Gaddafi death US supported this military operation Obama lied he
[47:33.400 --> 47:37.400]  said it wasn't it wasn't regime change of course it was regime change we saw that
[47:37.400 --> 47:43.760]  today with Gaddafi's supposed body and what what more proof does one need I
[47:43.760 --> 47:49.240]  would hope that we stop this with the presidency Bush and now Obama hold these
[47:49.240 --> 47:53.600]  people accountable they're violating US law they need to be held accountable
[47:53.600 --> 47:58.400]  Obama needs to be impeached Bush is that office we can't do it to him but we
[47:58.400 --> 48:05.020]  can we can stop Obama in his tracks Wayne let's expand on this clearly the UN
[48:05.020 --> 48:10.120]  NATO global corporate axis is making its move it's imploding Europe setting up a
[48:10.120 --> 48:14.320]  financial dictatorship admitting no sovereignty of the countries irrevocably
[48:14.320 --> 48:19.440]  transferred I mean that is total domination that is total occupation that
[48:19.440 --> 48:26.400]  is just just the equivalent of Hitler rolling into France I mean it's on or
[48:26.400 --> 48:30.880]  the Soviets rolling into the Czech you know Czechoslovakia all of this
[48:30.880 --> 48:36.920]  happening you've got global Ponzi operations being imploded in other parts
[48:36.920 --> 48:41.000]  of the world not just in Europe you've got it coming to a head here in the
[48:41.000 --> 48:46.240]  United States you've got Soros clearly trying to energize and take over the
[48:46.240 --> 48:51.000]  Occupy Wall Street you've got this new UN model of having rebels try to
[48:51.000 --> 48:55.040]  overthrow a government then Western powers come in and back them up engage
[48:55.040 --> 49:01.160]  in huge war crimes and call it peace why is the Western establishment moving on
[49:01.160 --> 49:04.880]  every front right now is it out of strength or out of an attempt to
[49:04.880 --> 49:09.240]  globally intimidate the world well they see they're on their last leg they see
[49:09.240 --> 49:14.480]  what's happening to their economies they see that the the BRIC countries that
[49:14.480 --> 49:19.400]  Brazil Russia India China South Africa and Turkey and others are their
[49:19.400 --> 49:23.600]  economies are doing much better these are the rising world powers we already
[49:23.600 --> 49:28.160]  have Putin and next president of Russia the once the future president Russia
[49:28.160 --> 49:33.240]  talking about a new Eurasian Economic Union to rival the collapsing European
[49:33.240 --> 49:37.400]  Union you know what this is this is the these are the final death throws of the
[49:37.400 --> 49:41.600]  dying Empire the US then its extended Empire around the world and all of its
[49:41.600 --> 49:47.120]  vassal states England France Germany and others they're collapsing and and this
[49:47.120 --> 49:52.400]  is what we see with empires they do these Hail Mary passes thinking
[49:52.400 --> 49:56.760]  they're gonna survive when in fact they know they're going down and and you
[49:56.760 --> 50:01.120]  know Obama sending troops to Uganda to defeat the Lord's Resistance Army of
[50:01.120 --> 50:05.720]  Joseph Coney who's basically out of the picture he has been for some years this
[50:05.720 --> 50:11.000]  is a 25 year old rebellion against our dictator in Uganda my 70 and all of a
[50:11.000 --> 50:15.320]  sudden he decides to send troops this is all about oil this is about denying
[50:15.320 --> 50:21.000]  Uganda's oil to the Chinese and and use it as a launching pad to go after what
[50:21.000 --> 50:26.160]  remains of the country of Sudan so that's what we've got going on here this is a
[50:26.160 --> 50:31.280]  power play but the disease these empires are collapsing the US has no
[50:31.280 --> 50:35.680]  influence left in Latin America for example the Monroe Doctrine is finished
[50:35.680 --> 50:39.920]  and we're seeing a lot of other doctrines go down the tubes including
[50:39.920 --> 50:44.280]  Obama's I think Obama's doctrine of backing these rebel movements and and it
[50:44.280 --> 50:50.480]  was called R2P responsibility to protect his nonsense that came out of Samantha
[50:50.480 --> 50:53.640]  power stay there stay there let's come back and break that down and look at
[50:53.640 --> 50:58.920]  Occupy Wall Street as well white Madsen's our guest stay with us
[50:58.920 --> 51:03.840]  this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a
[51:03.840 --> 51:08.160]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double
[51:08.160 --> 51:12.320]  or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control
[51:12.320 --> 51:16.360]  how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total
[51:16.360 --> 51:20.240]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[51:20.240 --> 51:24.360]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[51:24.360 --> 51:28.680]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the

[54:27.280 --> 54:34.480]  Babylon system is the vampire I want to be clear here power corrupts absolute
[54:34.480 --> 54:38.680]  power corrupts absolutely is what Lord Acton said hundreds of years ago that's
[54:38.680 --> 54:43.600]  just common sense I love America I love our Republic I know we've been the good
[54:43.600 --> 54:47.680]  guys compared to many others in history the human condition is the human
[54:47.680 --> 54:52.280]  condition the great heights the great lows the wondrous heights the painful
[54:52.280 --> 54:57.720]  disgusting lows when we talk about China Russia all these groups very corrupt
[54:57.720 --> 55:04.880]  serious problems but because they weren't as powerful and good as we were when
[55:04.880 --> 55:08.920]  evil took them over they just disintegrated when evil took us over it
[55:08.920 --> 55:15.560]  had an engine of incredible power and because we were the good guys we became
[55:15.560 --> 55:20.680]  very naive and just bought into the fact that we're the good guys that's it all
[55:20.680 --> 55:24.280]  over this country now they have TSA checkpoints on highways searching
[55:24.280 --> 55:31.800]  families I went through one yesterday and but up in Tennessee now you know
[55:31.800 --> 55:36.320]  Homeland Security pulling families out I mean they're really gearing up for total
[55:36.320 --> 55:41.040]  collapse and the Empire needs to have total tyranny because it knows it's
[55:41.040 --> 55:45.960]  going to end up going to prison see it's an all or nothing the globalists
[55:45.960 --> 55:51.000]  have committed as Wayne said a Hail Mary's been thrown here they're gonna
[55:51.000 --> 55:54.360]  try to get class warfare going they're gonna try to trigger the revolution
[55:54.360 --> 55:58.480]  themselves through Occupy Wall Street which now is admitted to be run by the
[55:58.480 --> 56:02.120]  State Department and the government's gonna use that for austerity we're in
[56:02.120 --> 56:08.600]  deep deep deep deep trouble so when we talk about all the evil our country's
[56:08.600 --> 56:13.560]  doing remember that's a hijacked nation I don't blame the German people they
[56:13.560 --> 56:17.440]  got seduced by Hitler I blame the few million that actually aided him and knew
[56:17.440 --> 56:21.000]  what was happening I don't blame the Russians for monsters like linen and
[56:21.000 --> 56:26.600]  Stalin it happens through a progress or the Chinese for now or Mexicans for
[56:26.600 --> 56:30.720]  what's happening in Mexico it's a process it's the norm going back to Wayne
[56:30.720 --> 56:34.000]  I won't keep in five minutes the next hour if he can do it and then we've got
[56:34.000 --> 56:37.800]  our next guest joining us but Wayne you hear what I'm saying here don't you I
[56:37.800 --> 56:41.520]  mean my point is looking at history studying things to watch the system
[56:41.520 --> 56:45.520]  running around getting everything ready for martial law and selling
[56:45.520 --> 56:49.680]  political arrest what is the elite getting ready for how does Occupy
[56:49.680 --> 56:54.760]  Wall Street tie into that what's your take on it well I you know it's always
[56:54.760 --> 56:59.160]  good when you see people especially grassroots with homemade signs out there
[56:59.160 --> 57:04.400]  exercising their First Amendment rights protesting these outrageous that have
[57:04.400 --> 57:08.800]  been taking place in this country but it's also as the usual thing and I saw
[57:08.800 --> 57:13.760]  it here in Washington with the Occupy movement here we're a representative of
[57:13.760 --> 57:19.760]  one of the labor unions said to the group at Freedom Plaza here hey listen if
[57:19.760 --> 57:26.720]  you guys want bottled water just go down and march in the March for Obama's
[57:26.720 --> 57:31.200]  jobs bill you know that was the one to contain free free trade agreement I was
[57:31.200 --> 57:36.840]  gonna see you as jobs go away to South Korea Columbia and Panama go down and
[57:36.840 --> 57:41.840]  support that and the AFLTI will give you all the free bottled water you want you
[57:41.840 --> 57:45.800]  know bribery this is just old breath you know and it was quite clear that hold
[57:45.800 --> 57:49.080]  it right there hold it right there you've got the unions calling for
[57:49.080 --> 57:53.040]  globalism which gets rid of the jobs and people say why don't I support the
[57:53.040 --> 57:57.280]  unions support the unions they're not even supporting our jobs well let me tell
[57:57.280 --> 58:02.160]  you when that offer was made at least the consensus of the group there was no
[58:02.160 --> 58:06.760]  they rejected it they said no we we don't we'll get our pot we'll get our
[58:06.760 --> 58:11.280]  water from somewhere else so people are wise to what's going on here they're
[58:11.280 --> 58:16.120]  wise to what Obama is trying to do and what David Fluth is trying to do and
[58:16.120 --> 58:22.280]  trying to co-opt this movement for the election cycle and and so I mean that's
[58:22.280 --> 58:26.560]  what I think we have to be wary of and of course yes George Soros has billions
[58:26.560 --> 58:30.520]  to throw at this Wayne stay there Wayne Madson report.com because I want to do
[58:30.520 --> 58:35.080]  five more minutes with you I had a John B. Wells syndicated talk show us joining

[01:00:12.520 --> 01:00:19.800]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[01:00:19.800 --> 01:00:26.200]  Alex Jones all right we're into hour number two syndicated talk show host
[01:00:26.200 --> 01:00:33.280]  John B. Wells also famous voice talent will be joining us we're really like
[01:00:33.280 --> 01:00:37.600]  his analysis and views on having the world we want to get his take on it
[01:00:37.600 --> 01:00:41.000]  I'll also open the phones up towards the end of his interview partly joining us
[01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:45.240]  as well going back to Wayne Madsen who's been over in Libya we were getting
[01:00:45.240 --> 01:00:50.120]  into the whole Occupy Wall Street here's my breakdown we know Obama connected
[01:00:50.120 --> 01:00:54.360]  groups put out the called Occupy Wall Street three months ago for October
[01:00:54.360 --> 01:00:58.040]  knowing just the general crowds would show up then they intended to send in
[01:00:58.040 --> 01:01:02.200]  their agitators to take control of it that's failed but the system doesn't
[01:01:02.200 --> 01:01:06.400]  care they're just having the national news still just aim cameras at their
[01:01:06.400 --> 01:01:12.640]  spokesman and pretend like these people support Obama as some desperate desperate
[01:01:12.640 --> 01:01:16.600]  ploy I don't see it working just like the Republicans tried to co-opt the Tea
[01:01:16.600 --> 01:01:19.720]  Party and we're only partially successful what do you say to that I
[01:01:19.720 --> 01:01:27.160]  believe that's true I have been to the Occupy activities here in the DC area and
[01:01:27.160 --> 01:01:32.440]  I have to say that the there's a lot of opiants I hope Obama people I mean they
[01:01:32.440 --> 01:01:36.680]  know he's a product the Wall Street and they know that George Soros is Wall Street
[01:01:36.680 --> 01:01:41.560]  I mean these people think that Soros is some sort of very God's a father that
[01:01:41.560 --> 01:01:46.120]  comes around and and sprinkles money on you for good deeds I mean that's not his
[01:01:46.120 --> 01:01:51.960]  history this man is this man has destroyed entire economies of nations and
[01:01:51.960 --> 01:01:56.680]  he's quite proud of it but I think the fact is that he was obviously involved
[01:01:56.680 --> 01:02:01.360]  with some of these Facebook Twitter operations in Egypt and Tunisia to some
[01:02:01.360 --> 01:02:06.400]  extent Olivia but look as some of this is backfired because when the poor people
[01:02:06.400 --> 01:02:12.360]  get out there and and start demanding change that's not the the latte drinking
[01:02:12.360 --> 01:02:18.440]  of people that follow George Soros and this is what happened in Cairo and
[01:02:18.440 --> 01:02:22.120]  this is what happened in Tunisia this is what's happening in Athens because
[01:02:22.120 --> 01:02:26.280]  that they the people in Greece and Spain don't want any of these deals with these
[01:02:26.280 --> 01:02:32.520]  bankers and I think these people like Soros and obviously he fronts for the
[01:02:32.520 --> 01:02:37.160]  Rothschild these people are very concerned now because people are starting to
[01:02:37.160 --> 01:02:41.400]  get wise to this to their tactics and to the way they conduct their their
[01:02:41.400 --> 01:02:47.160]  business and and I think it's a it's going to be a zero-sum game in this
[01:02:47.160 --> 01:02:52.040]  whole thing when when the people in 99% of the world think how many people that
[01:02:52.040 --> 01:02:56.720]  is and in some countries is higher than 99% it's like less than one one
[01:02:56.720 --> 01:03:01.080]  one hundredth of one percent who have the wealth in certain countries when
[01:03:01.080 --> 01:03:06.120]  these people rise up they're not going to be in any mood to compromise with the
[01:03:06.120 --> 01:03:09.400]  elite well that's what I was going to get to is that we've seen the Federal
[01:03:09.400 --> 01:03:14.120]  Reserve and all these globalists and Obama indoors occupy Wall Street hey
[01:03:14.120 --> 01:03:17.120]  that's an attempt to make it a left-right issue just like Republicans
[01:03:17.120 --> 01:03:20.840]  endorsing the Tea Party so that the left wouldn't get involved with the Tea Party
[01:03:20.840 --> 01:03:25.080]  now they call the Occupy Wall Street leftists so the right won't get
[01:03:25.080 --> 01:03:30.800]  involved they don't want us ever getting together right and the people for the
[01:03:30.800 --> 01:03:35.480]  most part in the Occupy movement reject both political parties they reject the
[01:03:35.480 --> 01:03:39.800]  Republicans and the Democrats they don't even like this system of government
[01:03:39.800 --> 01:03:45.480]  anymore they want a fundamental change in the way we're governed so we're
[01:03:45.480 --> 01:03:50.360]  talking about people are calling for a major constitutional change in this
[01:03:50.360 --> 01:03:55.720]  country because the system is so broken so corrupted can it be fixed and I would
[01:03:55.720 --> 01:03:59.840]  point out that Thomas Jefferson and Abraham Lincoln both said it's not
[01:03:59.840 --> 01:04:04.400]  only you're right it's your duty to replace this form of government if it
[01:04:04.400 --> 01:04:12.200]  turns out that it becomes repressive and an unworkable situation where do you
[01:04:12.200 --> 01:04:17.240]  see this ending then the last 30 seconds well I you know I mean the media is
[01:04:17.240 --> 01:04:22.240]  going to be doing their best to try to frame this and then put out this
[01:04:22.240 --> 01:04:27.760]  information but I think people are now using their own means of communication
[01:04:27.760 --> 01:04:32.760]  there they're not beholden to the media this could go anywhere I don't think
[01:04:32.760 --> 01:04:37.640]  anyone can actually foresee the future and we know that with the revolutionary
[01:04:37.640 --> 01:04:42.480]  periods of time you can never predict the future we saw that with solidarity in
[01:04:42.480 --> 01:04:47.360]  Poland and we saw the eventual collapse of the Soviet Union right Wayne Madsen
[01:04:47.360 --> 01:04:52.360]  thank you Wayne thank you so much great points we'll talk to you soon there's
[01:04:52.360 --> 01:04:56.520]  no doubt this is the time that the world's future is being dictated all of
[01:04:56.520 --> 01:05:03.000]  us need to be involved on the side of good against evil Alex Jones here with

[01:08:10.080 --> 01:08:19.600]  it is Thursday the 20th day of October 2011 and while the world is busy
[01:08:19.600 --> 01:08:25.720]  questioning whether Muammar Gaddafi is dead or not like other fabled
[01:08:25.720 --> 01:08:31.760]  individuals or some have been laden big developments are taking place in the
[01:08:31.760 --> 01:08:35.440]  economy we'll talk more about this coming up later in the hour with our
[01:08:35.440 --> 01:08:42.080]  guests after we cover some other issues but here's CNBC a long steep drop for
[01:08:42.080 --> 01:08:46.120]  Americans standard of living and it breaks down that you've got to basically
[01:08:46.120 --> 01:08:51.000]  have higher taxes and no future under globalism to pay off the tens of
[01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:55.960]  trillions well it's actually the thousand plus trillion in Ponzi scheme
[01:08:55.960 --> 01:09:02.200]  derivatives to the central banks isn't that interesting here's another one a
[01:09:02.200 --> 01:09:08.680]  city group to pay millions to close fraud complaint also the Associated Press
[01:09:08.680 --> 01:09:13.680]  is reporting 70 plus trillion dollars in Bank of America derivatives
[01:09:13.680 --> 01:09:20.800]  secretly bailed out and backstopped we're talking about 70 plus trillion for
[01:09:20.800 --> 01:09:25.320]  Bank of America and derivatives the entire deficit isn't even 15 trillion
[01:09:25.320 --> 01:09:30.640]  okay we'll get an idea of how they're inducing us through traders they
[01:09:30.640 --> 01:09:36.640]  control in government having us sign on to their mega debt it's incredible I'll
[01:09:36.640 --> 01:09:41.000]  talk about that on the nightly news this evening this is the most incredible
[01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:44.400]  article of the day it's even bigger than checkpoints all over the country with
[01:09:44.400 --> 01:09:48.880]  TSA jerking families out of their cars we covered in the last hour it's up on
[01:09:48.880 --> 01:09:54.480]  infowars.com and drudgereport.com no this is from KLFY with a
[01:09:54.480 --> 01:10:00.480]  straight face they say bans on cash you're only allowed to use cash with
[01:10:00.480 --> 01:10:08.640]  major retailers you cannot use cash for a second-hand sale that includes all
[01:10:08.640 --> 01:10:13.600]  garage sales swap meets you know you name it this is directly out of the most
[01:10:13.600 --> 01:10:18.240]  horrific dictatorships ever seen cold hard cash it's good everywhere you go
[01:10:18.240 --> 01:10:22.320]  right you can use it to pay for anything but that's not the case here in
[01:10:22.320 --> 01:10:26.440]  Louisiana now it's a law that passed during this year's busy legislative
[01:10:26.440 --> 01:10:30.880]  session House Bill 195 basically says those who buy and sell secondhand goods
[01:10:30.880 --> 01:10:34.480]  cannot use cash to make those transactions so they want to kill the
[01:10:34.480 --> 01:10:37.280]  underground economy that's why they're arresting people selling lemonade all
[01:10:37.280 --> 01:10:42.800]  over the country or tomatoes or pumpkins and SWAT teaming Amish you're just
[01:10:42.800 --> 01:10:47.200]  selling milk to their neighbor you are guilty until pre-venison you can't be
[01:10:47.200 --> 01:10:53.840]  trusted in a cash economy that's part of the 999 sales tax plan that's where
[01:10:53.840 --> 01:10:56.840]  they now have a federal sales tax if they if the Federal Reserve gets its way
[01:10:56.840 --> 01:11:01.480]  and a VAT where every transaction is tracked and you swipe a card even when
[01:11:01.480 --> 01:11:08.320]  you use cash this is gonna be a graduated sales tax and they go on to say
[01:11:08.320 --> 01:11:12.160]  that's the way it is SWAT teams are standing by and the checkpoints are
[01:11:12.160 --> 01:11:16.120]  being set up as well and they're now saying citizens will now be on these
[01:11:16.120 --> 01:11:20.240]  Homeland Security pickup lists not a rest list you don't get a judge you don't
[01:11:20.240 --> 01:11:25.280]  get a jury they can kill you in secret under new federal edicts not laws they
[01:11:25.280 --> 01:11:28.440]  can kill you as citizens that's been announced and they just say under the
[01:11:28.440 --> 01:11:32.040]  enemy combatant act you'll pull up to a checkpoint you're on the list you
[01:11:32.040 --> 01:11:36.160]  disappear you're never seen again and by the way you never thought you get
[01:11:36.160 --> 01:11:39.120]  social as health care you never thought they'd ban cash never thought they'd
[01:11:39.120 --> 01:11:43.520]  have federal checkpoints on the highways it's here it's all coming it's the new
[01:11:43.520 --> 01:11:49.160]  world order never thought you'd see Mexican troops operating inside the US

[01:12:56.880 --> 01:13:00.200]  thanks for joining us thanks a lot Alex I'll tell you I think that's the closest
[01:13:00.200 --> 01:13:05.400]  I'll ever come to an Academy Award thank you and I should add you're a host on
[01:13:05.400 --> 01:13:10.000]  coast-to-coast AM as well that's the most fun job the guy could possibly have
[01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:13.760]  other than being on your show well you know I'm a loudmouth who'll take up all
[01:13:13.760 --> 01:13:17.720]  the time so let's get rolling here what do you think of laws and moves around
[01:13:17.720 --> 01:13:24.160]  the US to ban cash if you're not a big box globalist store you know Alex I've
[01:13:24.160 --> 01:13:27.880]  spent so much time people might wonder why would you want to talk to a voice
[01:13:27.880 --> 01:13:31.760]  over guy but I'll tell you very quickly over the course of my career I've been
[01:13:31.760 --> 01:13:37.000]  privileged I mean it's a blessing and a curse so if you if you subscribe to the
[01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:40.640]  theory that ignorance is bliss I think maybe that's a correct statement
[01:13:40.640 --> 01:13:46.600]  because I've read many many things about various various projects that I had to
[01:13:46.600 --> 01:13:51.840]  sign the paper on many many projects for the what Dwight Eisenhower referred to
[01:13:51.840 --> 01:13:57.000]  as the military industry of complex the fact is is that this in my opinion is
[01:13:57.000 --> 01:14:02.440]  the first move toward the cashless society and I suspect it'll only
[01:14:02.440 --> 01:14:07.000]  accelerate from here with all of this facial recognition being rolled out and
[01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:12.160]  iris scans and all this craziness with the TSA and now of course what more
[01:14:12.160 --> 01:14:17.560]  innocuous place to kick this off and in Louisiana under the auspices of being
[01:14:17.560 --> 01:14:21.220]  able to track you know the drug traffickers you know I've spent most of
[01:14:21.220 --> 01:14:26.120]  my life being under threat of some sort of a war I was born around the time the
[01:14:26.120 --> 01:14:29.480]  Korean War ended and then immediately after that we went into the Vietnam War
[01:14:29.480 --> 01:14:32.920]  and then there was the war on poverty and then there was the war on drugs and
[01:14:32.920 --> 01:14:36.720]  there's now there's the war on terror and so I guess we're all war babies if we
[01:14:36.720 --> 01:14:40.920]  were you know born anytime after World War two and I don't see this getting
[01:14:40.920 --> 01:14:46.320]  better I see it getting I see it getting much worse and and I think between
[01:14:46.320 --> 01:14:49.640]  I don't know maybe the Mayans have something made by 20 there's no telling
[01:14:49.640 --> 01:14:53.880]  how much damage can be caused in the next year and a couple of months and
[01:14:53.880 --> 01:14:59.040]  I'm gravely concerned about it well they the government is acting like it's the
[01:14:59.040 --> 01:15:02.800]  end of the world I mean rolling out checkpoints sticking their hands down
[01:15:02.800 --> 01:15:07.440]  our pants they want to set the precedent for forced inoculations they've
[01:15:07.440 --> 01:15:13.000]  openly promoted that with the Emergency Health Powers Act this is really
[01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:18.640]  frightening what this country is turning into and then you look at the fact
[01:15:18.640 --> 01:15:23.760]  that globalism has deindustrialized our country what's your view on this whole
[01:15:23.760 --> 01:15:29.880]  new world order system and where it wants to take us well a friend you may
[01:15:29.880 --> 01:15:34.440]  know a fellow named Mr. Vando Gonzalez wrote a very interesting book this is
[01:15:34.440 --> 01:15:37.960]  not my book so I'm you know I'm not I'm not hawking it but it's called
[01:15:37.960 --> 01:15:41.960]  psychological warfare in the new world order this is a really intensive book
[01:15:41.960 --> 01:15:48.880]  and it's obvious just like this it's obvious that you know as to quote a
[01:15:48.880 --> 01:15:53.600]  fictitious home secretary from one of my favorite shows as I ease into my
[01:15:53.600 --> 01:15:58.320]  dotage I find that timing is everything from I love making to the golf swing and
[01:15:58.320 --> 01:16:04.040]  this taking down this alleged taking down of Bin Laden followed by Anwar al-Alaqi
[01:16:04.040 --> 01:16:08.880]  and now finally with Gaddafi it just seems that all of these things of course
[01:16:08.880 --> 01:16:16.320]  you know al-Alaqi was a relatively recent player but it appears that all of
[01:16:16.320 --> 01:16:19.760]  these little like some sort of an infernal machine where you just were or
[01:16:19.760 --> 01:16:24.760]  or a or a tumbler on a safe you get one click and you go back to the left you
[01:16:24.760 --> 01:16:28.280]  can take that as the political left you get another click you go back to the
[01:16:28.280 --> 01:16:31.120]  right you get another click and then boom the door opens and the door
[01:16:31.120 --> 01:16:35.840]  unfortunately is the one that opens Pandora's box it's escalating rapidly in
[01:16:35.840 --> 01:16:39.080]  fact I saw on your site today this Tyrell corp there's one super
[01:16:39.080 --> 01:16:43.880]  corporation run the global economy once upon a time we listened though we read
[01:16:43.880 --> 01:16:47.600]  the great books and we learned from those great books now I think it's the
[01:16:47.600 --> 01:16:53.120]  great screenwriters that produce a lot of information that it will just allow
[01:16:53.120 --> 01:16:58.720]  ourselves to hear it I mean from little goofy things like like this operation
[01:16:58.720 --> 01:17:04.040]  endgame just a juvenile script but if you look deeply into it you'll see that
[01:17:04.040 --> 01:17:07.360]  there's a really much more serious thread of truth running through there
[01:17:07.360 --> 01:17:13.320]  almost like and I'll just whack silly for a minute you know as Bill was a was
[01:17:13.320 --> 01:17:18.800]  a great fan of comic books in that movie I killed Bill too I have been a fan of
[01:17:18.800 --> 01:17:22.680]  the three Stooges and in one of them they have the Axis powers all gathered
[01:17:22.680 --> 01:17:26.840]  together and one of them says this is not right your minorities are infiltrating
[01:17:26.840 --> 01:17:30.000]  our majorities until you've made our majorities minorities and of course you
[01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:32.800]  know Moe who's playing Hitler's tells him to shut up and hit him with a golf
[01:17:32.800 --> 01:17:38.000]  club or something this is this is all but but it's true but then which is why
[01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:42.680]  just shifting gears now if I warn you I'll go a little bit ADD here I think
[01:17:42.680 --> 01:17:47.640]  in the in the mode of firing the short barrel shotgun out the back door but
[01:17:47.640 --> 01:17:55.240]  that's where border security but the open border the massive influx of
[01:17:55.240 --> 01:18:01.480]  undocumented and then in the vast majority untraceable people coming in
[01:18:01.480 --> 01:18:06.840]  here no one can deny that this isn't just some mess that's just sort of happened
[01:18:06.840 --> 01:18:11.520]  you know kind of like the universe was just a mess that just happened my
[01:18:11.520 --> 01:18:15.280]  feeling is the universe was most as we know it was most definitely created by
[01:18:15.280 --> 01:18:20.320]  superior power and this mess that the whole world is is facing now has also
[01:18:20.320 --> 01:18:25.080]  been created by an earthly superior power and they are held down to execute
[01:18:25.080 --> 01:18:30.760]  their purposes that's just how it is well you're right and 98 miles into the
[01:18:30.760 --> 01:18:35.520]  border inside Texas they wanted to search my car and I had to have this big
[01:18:35.520 --> 01:18:40.320]  confrontation yesterday and I shot video of it for the second time in just a
[01:18:40.320 --> 01:18:46.120]  month again John B. Wells is our guest and it's so asinine that homeland
[01:18:46.120 --> 01:18:51.120]  security is now running random checkpoints at malls high schools and
[01:18:51.120 --> 01:18:56.840]  highways and saying we never know where terrorists will be but then the border is
[01:18:56.840 --> 01:19:01.120]  basically wide open and they lecture us all day about how much danger we're
[01:19:01.120 --> 01:19:05.600]  under and they're just gonna have random checkpoints clearly it's to train us to
[01:19:05.600 --> 01:19:09.520]  be prisoners and have no rights it has nothing to do with the illegals Janet
[01:19:09.520 --> 01:19:14.920]  Napolitano is in the news today legalizing illegals and not deporting
[01:19:14.920 --> 01:19:19.440]  them by executive fiat so I want to I want to come back and talk about that
[01:19:19.440 --> 01:19:23.080]  but is that what you're getting at well absolutely and then don't forget the
[01:19:23.080 --> 01:19:26.840]  part about if you object to any of this you're immediately branded a racist
[01:19:26.840 --> 01:19:30.520]  although the last time I checked Mexico was a national now Mexican was a
[01:19:30.520 --> 01:19:35.680]  nationality not a race but of course if you do anything that makes it look like
[01:19:35.680 --> 01:19:39.760]  you're against any group of people then you're you're you're hit with that
[01:19:39.760 --> 01:19:43.320]  brand and that brand stays there that brand is like our Keith Richard said
[01:19:43.320 --> 01:19:49.480]  about reputations so like a long shadow it's very difficult to overcome and
[01:19:49.480 --> 01:19:53.720]  well I mean it's obvious look there's all this stuff about the well the states
[01:19:53.720 --> 01:19:56.480]  when that when the when the John stay there we got a break I want to hear about

[01:24:05.880 --> 01:24:15.600]  behind enemy lines the information war continues it's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network well
[01:24:15.600 --> 01:24:20.320]  he's one of the top voiceover guys in the world Emmy award-winning Cleo
[01:24:20.320 --> 01:24:26.360]  Marconi awards for radio he hosts a few times a month and I always enjoy it when
[01:24:26.360 --> 01:24:31.960]  I hear him hosting Coast to Coast AM second most listen to radio broadcast in
[01:24:31.960 --> 01:24:36.820]  the world after Rush Limbaugh this is a short segment with John B. Wells JB Wells
[01:24:36.820 --> 01:24:41.180]  calm of course is his website we were getting into the whole border situation
[01:24:41.180 --> 01:24:45.580]  I mean it really does render asinine all of this let's set up checkpoints
[01:24:45.580 --> 01:24:50.100]  randomly around the country and see if we catch one of these imaginary terrorists
[01:24:50.100 --> 01:24:53.820]  when we really know it's about training us to live in a police state while the
[01:24:53.820 --> 01:24:58.420]  borders are basically wide open you were continuing with that point well you
[01:24:58.420 --> 01:25:02.140]  know that when the feds came against Arizona saying that oh well your state
[01:25:02.140 --> 01:25:06.700]  law is is going to trump federal law I mean I don't understand why I'm not a
[01:25:06.700 --> 01:25:12.100]  lawyer I'm not a legal scholar but I you know I know kind of something silly
[01:25:12.100 --> 01:25:14.980]  when I see it and it's like well isn't there a presumption that the federal
[01:25:14.980 --> 01:25:20.580]  government will uphold the law and is it not incumbent upon the states to uphold
[01:25:20.580 --> 01:25:24.980]  the law when the federal government does not do this so they're all it's all
[01:25:24.980 --> 01:25:30.580]  about making friends I suppose you know as far as what we're shown but I think
[01:25:30.580 --> 01:25:35.860]  there is a concerted effort to take this country down and every time we allow
[01:25:35.860 --> 01:25:42.340]  some some part of the Constitution anything in the Bill of Rights to be to
[01:25:42.340 --> 01:25:49.420]  be sacrificed for what the government now calls the the greater good well if
[01:25:49.420 --> 01:25:53.500]  nobody does anything about it then it's like on to step two let's knock out
[01:25:53.500 --> 01:25:56.400]  another one you know there could be you know people have made several of the
[01:25:56.400 --> 01:26:00.140]  several people who've made allegations of this whole fast and furious deal I mean
[01:26:00.140 --> 01:26:03.460]  what kind of sense does that make we're gonna ship guns down to Mexico so we
[01:26:03.460 --> 01:26:07.220]  can track the cartels and then blame the Second Amendment but but look
[01:26:07.220 --> 01:26:12.700]  expanding on that Mexico is a failed state Mexico arrest anybody that comes
[01:26:12.700 --> 01:26:17.260]  to their country illegally I mean since when is there's this idea of I've got
[01:26:17.260 --> 01:26:22.540]  to pay taxes so illegals get in state tuition and then I'm bad if I don't I
[01:26:22.540 --> 01:26:27.740]  can't go to Mexico and get in state tuition I mean it's it's ridiculous it's
[01:26:27.740 --> 01:26:33.460]  part of a globalist plan to break this country up and more and more it's clearly
[01:26:33.460 --> 01:26:38.500]  divide and conquer you know Alex this is a not I know we got a short spot here
[01:26:38.500 --> 01:26:42.140]  but let me get all of this out before somebody labels me as a neo-nazi for
[01:26:42.140 --> 01:26:46.940]  bringing this up that little movie downfall where Erno Gantz did such a
[01:26:46.940 --> 01:26:50.540]  brilliant job of playing it off Hitler that was based on proud old Jungas
[01:26:50.540 --> 01:26:53.980]  secretary who was in the bunker when all this happened and one of the most
[01:26:53.980 --> 01:26:59.900]  horrifying things that came out of Hitler's mouth was that one of his
[01:26:59.900 --> 01:27:03.580]  one of his commanders came in and said yes my fear but what about the wounded
[01:27:03.580 --> 01:27:06.700]  and the elderly and the children and all of that and he's like I don't care
[01:27:06.700 --> 01:27:10.820]  about their primitive needs look the German people gave us a mandate and if
[01:27:10.820 --> 01:27:14.500]  it doesn't work out if they're not strong enough to to pull it through well
[01:27:14.500 --> 01:27:17.540]  and their little throats are getting cut well that's just tough and it's not my
[01:27:17.540 --> 01:27:21.740]  problem I think that's what we're looking at now I think that people are so
[01:27:21.740 --> 01:27:24.580]  afraid that they're going to be on a list or they're going to get a knock on
[01:27:24.580 --> 01:27:28.940]  the door I mean it could be anything it could be it could be anything from from
[01:27:28.940 --> 01:27:35.100]  for tax investigations it could be as you know some trumped up things here's a
[01:27:35.100 --> 01:27:39.860]  thing this is what's this is what's so rough it's not illegal to ask a question
[01:27:39.860 --> 01:27:43.100]  which is why I'm being in the spot now being interviewed by you I'm liable open
[01:27:43.100 --> 01:27:46.940]  my mouth and say something I really wish I hadn't said but that's just how it is
[01:27:46.940 --> 01:27:50.380]  because you know if I were immortal I'd worry about it but I'm not immortal in
[01:27:50.380 --> 01:27:54.340]  this realm I'm not worried about the afterlife I'm all right with that it's
[01:27:54.340 --> 01:27:57.820]  not illegal to ask a question but statements can get you in trouble and
[01:27:57.820 --> 01:28:01.060]  you only have to be accused even if you're not guilty it'll cost you
[01:28:01.060 --> 01:28:04.340]  everything you have just to defend yourself and in the meantime you'll be
[01:28:04.340 --> 01:28:08.260]  you'll be demonized and vilified and then you'll emerge out of this this
[01:28:08.260 --> 01:28:12.060]  this legal crisis and you'll go back out in the world and people will be
[01:28:12.060 --> 01:28:14.980]  looking at you like well he must have done something really terrible to screw
[01:28:14.980 --> 01:28:18.660]  up it's just like Alexander Solzenditz and we wrote that Gulag archipelago he
[01:28:18.660 --> 01:28:22.260]  said nobody would say look they're arresting me they're arresting me for
[01:28:22.260 --> 01:28:24.900]  no reason there's somebody to do something everybody just came there
[01:28:24.900 --> 01:28:29.100]  kept their mouth shut and the KGB came up and they just take him away and
[01:28:29.100 --> 01:28:32.460]  that's it they wind up on some Gulag iceberg somewhere and that's the end of
[01:28:32.460 --> 01:28:37.180]  them and the only thing that brought him down to the end was what money because
[01:28:37.180 --> 01:28:39.740]  there were nothing but blow all the time anyway they didn't have the missiles they
[01:28:39.740 --> 01:28:42.580]  claim they had they didn't have the money or the clout they claim they had but
[01:28:42.580 --> 01:28:46.300]  they had a good front so but it was all yeah all the Cold War we got a fear of
[01:28:46.300 --> 01:28:52.180]  the Russians and it sets off communist hysteria here and John you just said
[01:28:52.180 --> 01:28:56.580]  it beautifully we've got to call the bluff that's why I just go out in big
[01:28:56.580 --> 01:29:00.620]  crowds nobody guard that's why I confront the checkpoints and get in the
[01:29:00.620 --> 01:29:05.460]  police face because we've got to call the bluff or they win people think by
[01:29:05.460 --> 01:29:10.900]  cowering that's how you stay safe no that's how you invite the wolves you
[01:29:10.900 --> 01:29:15.420]  got to face them down and we're not pray we got to face down these predators
[01:29:15.420 --> 01:29:19.860]  well I absolutely agree with you for a long time I thought that the key to
[01:29:19.860 --> 01:29:25.180]  surviving the next one that the next you know in position of power let's just
[01:29:25.180 --> 01:29:30.700]  call it federal power in this case would be invisibility and a high level of
[01:29:30.700 --> 01:29:33.740]  mobility but I don't think that way anymore I mean I reserve the right to
[01:29:33.740 --> 01:29:37.380]  change my mind I think let's elaborate John stay there you're right everybody
[01:29:37.380 --> 01:29:41.980]  can feel it the real crises are coming this is just birth pains it's now time
[01:29:41.980 --> 01:29:46.620]  to pick where you are in eternity pick a side all in we'll be right back it's

[01:31:03.100 --> 01:31:07.500]  buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily
[01:31:07.500 --> 01:31:11.620]  double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to
[01:31:11.620 --> 01:31:15.420]  control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true

[01:31:19.060 --> 01:31:23.620]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[01:31:23.620 --> 01:31:28.260]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding
[01:31:28.260 --> 01:31:32.020]  the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids
[01:31:32.020 --> 01:31:35.500]  every year thousands of families lose their power from weather related
[01:31:35.500 --> 01:31:39.420]  onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup

[01:35:26.300 --> 01:35:30.340]  of it it makes this this show possible but the most important thing is
[01:35:30.340 --> 01:35:34.460]  spreading the word you know about the federal reserve situation we're in
[01:35:34.460 --> 01:35:38.020]  contact with the Dallas Police Department about I'm now talking to other
[01:35:38.020 --> 01:35:41.340]  witnesses that indeed there was a provocateur there trying to set us up
[01:35:41.340 --> 01:35:46.180]  that shows that we're hurting them for them to go to those type of links that
[01:35:46.180 --> 01:35:49.500]  the fact the fellow reserves fall complaints with YouTube trying to take
[01:35:49.500 --> 01:35:53.500]  down our videos and YouTube didn't do it by the way because we called them on it
[01:35:53.500 --> 01:35:58.260]  shows we're hurting them I mean to think about this ladies and gentlemen we're
[01:35:58.260 --> 01:36:03.380]  reaching tens of millions of people a week now and it's only growing and they
[01:36:03.380 --> 01:36:06.940]  can't really kill me I mean they may still I get threats all the time because
[01:36:06.940 --> 01:36:12.180]  I'm nothing special this information is out there now I mean go to the drudge
[01:36:12.180 --> 01:36:15.500]  report today Luke Radowski went interviewed Alec Baldwin he endorsed
[01:36:15.500 --> 01:36:20.060]  capitalism that's up on the drudge report our article about the State
[01:36:20.060 --> 01:36:23.380]  Department running Occupy Wall Street that's up on drudge report number one
[01:36:23.380 --> 01:36:29.780]  website in the world for news tens of millions a day truth is contagious
[01:36:29.780 --> 01:36:34.540]  truth is popular and yes for some of us that are out at the very tip of the
[01:36:34.540 --> 01:36:41.460]  spear it's dangerous but it's like the Braveheart line yes we might go out on
[01:36:41.460 --> 01:36:46.860]  this battlefield and lose today but what about many years from now lying in our
[01:36:46.860 --> 01:36:52.060]  beds you know about to die what will we give to just come back here and tell our
[01:36:52.060 --> 01:36:55.420]  enemies you can take our lives that you can't take our freedom I mean it
[01:36:55.420 --> 01:36:59.260]  infuriates me to see this video we're gonna play a clip of later of state
[01:36:59.260 --> 01:37:03.300]  police with Homeland Security and TSA looking at people on the highway like
[01:37:03.300 --> 01:37:06.980]  we're all guilty and criminals like what we're being inducted into a prison and
[01:37:06.980 --> 01:37:10.220]  pulling people out of cars and searching vehicles without warrants because
[01:37:10.220 --> 01:37:14.980]  they're trying to stop terrorism that should make you fight or flight it
[01:37:14.980 --> 01:37:20.140]  should make you boil with disgust and concern that we know where this leads
[01:37:20.140 --> 01:37:25.580]  100% of the time going back to John B. Wells John I mean you hear the point I'm
[01:37:25.580 --> 01:37:30.220]  making you went to break making the point about it's all in time you had
[01:37:30.220 --> 01:37:34.180]  gotten to the point where you had gotten to the point where you thought you would
[01:37:34.180 --> 01:37:39.140]  just stay invisible please continue where the break cut into what you were
[01:37:39.140 --> 01:37:42.460]  saying and and then let's get into some other subjects and also talk about your
[01:37:42.460 --> 01:37:47.220]  other website well the thing is Alex I used to think invisibility was the key
[01:37:47.220 --> 01:37:50.300]  and they just run away from it there's no place to run it will visit you
[01:37:50.300 --> 01:37:55.380]  wherever you are so I just reverse myself on that it's like visibility high
[01:37:55.380 --> 01:37:59.580]  visibility is the key in that way look we're all mortal we're all gonna check
[01:37:59.580 --> 01:38:02.700]  out of here one day we're all gonna begin the final board boarding process out
[01:38:02.700 --> 01:38:08.420]  of this world however now is the time to stand for something or or just power
[01:38:08.420 --> 01:38:12.100]  like little mice and just let the cat take you over that's that's what's
[01:38:12.100 --> 01:38:16.820]  gonna happen however that said with all this occupy Wall Street occupy the fed
[01:38:16.820 --> 01:38:22.500]  stuff a I'm beginning to wonder if the apparatus isn't so big and things are
[01:38:22.500 --> 01:38:27.180]  are not so screwed up if you will and so far down the road that I mean
[01:38:27.180 --> 01:38:31.260]  revolution concerns me because if the if something like that were ever to
[01:38:31.260 --> 01:38:36.740]  happen that's when our enemies would fall upon us because they would see that
[01:38:36.740 --> 01:38:43.340]  as the weakest moment and therefore the best moment to to attack us or to what
[01:38:43.340 --> 01:38:46.860]  and I don't know because you know at least in theory the rest of the world
[01:38:46.860 --> 01:38:51.540]  relies on the United States for so much but I'm beginning to wonder apart from
[01:38:51.540 --> 01:38:58.660]  weapons manufacturer what that would be so look here's the thing if you just
[01:38:58.660 --> 01:39:01.700]  indulge me a second here this this came from Patrick Henry and it's a short
[01:39:01.700 --> 01:39:06.900]  piece but he said this was his speech on the stamp at March 23rd 1775 it is
[01:39:06.900 --> 01:39:10.700]  natural for man to indulge in the illusions of hope we are apt to shut
[01:39:10.700 --> 01:39:14.700]  our eyes against a painful truth and listen to the song of that siren till
[01:39:14.700 --> 01:39:20.300]  she transforms us into beasts is this the part of wise men engaged in a great
[01:39:20.300 --> 01:39:23.780]  and arduous struggle for liberty are we disposed to be at the number of those
[01:39:23.780 --> 01:39:28.820]  who having eyes at sea not and having ears here not the things which so nearly
[01:39:28.820 --> 01:39:33.620]  concerned their temporal salvation for my part whatever anguish of spirit it may
[01:39:33.620 --> 01:39:38.700]  cost I am willing to know the whole truth to know the worst and to provide
[01:39:38.700 --> 01:39:43.060]  for it you contrast that with George W. Bush and I actually liked him until I
[01:39:43.060 --> 01:39:46.860]  got into it a little bit man I'm not so sure who said let us never tolerate
[01:39:46.860 --> 01:39:50.380]  outrageous conspiracy theories concerning the attacks of September 11th
[01:39:50.380 --> 01:39:53.660]  followed by Gore Vidal who said apparently conspiracy stuff is now
[01:39:53.660 --> 01:39:59.380]  shorthand for unspeakable truth so I'm just as jacked up and angry about this
[01:39:59.380 --> 01:40:03.820]  as you are and you've been given your gift I have been given mine so if we
[01:40:03.820 --> 01:40:08.340]  can just bring some people you don't have to obey us blindly or join our
[01:40:08.340 --> 01:40:13.620]  legions blindly but at least listen and see how these these events are
[01:40:13.620 --> 01:40:18.940]  affecting your your lives bind together such a concerted effort is being made
[01:40:18.940 --> 01:40:22.860]  to drive us away from each other black against white against brown against
[01:40:22.860 --> 01:40:27.740]  Asian against the federal people the local people the state people we cannot
[01:40:27.740 --> 01:40:32.980]  allow this to happen we have to be a nation not just a country any place can
[01:40:32.980 --> 01:40:37.860]  be a country we need to be a nation and that that's the end of my rant for the
[01:40:37.860 --> 01:40:40.940]  next few seconds anyway well John beautifully said and that's why the
[01:40:40.940 --> 01:40:45.460]  globalist are trying to break up our sovereignty and bring so many people in
[01:40:45.460 --> 01:40:50.500]  and then tell them don't become Americans no keep your nationality so they
[01:40:50.500 --> 01:40:54.700]  can play us off against each other that's the real the real end game and
[01:40:54.700 --> 01:40:59.900]  look people call it a revolution I I'm involved in an information warfare
[01:40:59.900 --> 01:41:04.340]  revolution against lies but I've always said I'm not a revolutionary I'm a
[01:41:04.340 --> 01:41:09.380]  restorationist our Bill of Rights our Constitution though not fully lived up
[01:41:09.380 --> 01:41:13.940]  to in our country's history was the greatest flower of Renaissance and
[01:41:13.940 --> 01:41:21.940]  awakening and enlightenment and I want to go forward to the past I don't want
[01:41:21.940 --> 01:41:26.420]  to be a three four thousand year old thug run tyranny because we're going back
[01:41:26.420 --> 01:41:33.020]  before 1776 and 1789 we're going back to ancient tyranny with a high-tech
[01:41:33.020 --> 01:41:38.420]  overlay I want to go I want to go forward to the past to the most advanced
[01:41:38.420 --> 01:41:42.460]  thing we've developed I want to restore our Republic that's why when I pulled up
[01:41:42.460 --> 01:41:46.420]  to that checkpoint 98 miles into Texas and they said we're going to search your
[01:41:46.420 --> 01:41:53.220]  car I mean I righteously had zero fear and that actually scared me after the
[01:41:53.220 --> 01:41:58.900]  fact even though my little children were with me I didn't care and didn't even
[01:41:58.900 --> 01:42:04.700]  have to pump myself up I was so focused and so disgusted with these people that
[01:42:04.700 --> 01:42:09.260]  that at first they thought they scared me you know six border patrol guys around
[01:42:09.260 --> 01:42:13.660]  me and it was the opposite they I said I know the government brings in the drugs
[01:42:13.660 --> 01:42:17.020]  and I just totally hit them hard I'm gonna play it tonight on the nightly
[01:42:17.020 --> 01:42:22.700]  news but my point is is that is that I have to make myself now try to even have
[01:42:22.700 --> 01:42:27.580]  some concern I mean because I still want to have that frostiness it's like I'm
[01:42:27.580 --> 01:42:32.660]  getting getting to where I have zero fear and and it's almost the extreme
[01:42:32.660 --> 01:42:37.220]  opposite of what a lot of people have do you do you get where I'm going here
[01:42:37.220 --> 01:42:42.300]  I absolutely do I mean did I read that right the other week that the 747 or I
[01:42:42.300 --> 01:42:47.020]  think that was the actually the model number the aircraft full of cocaine was
[01:42:47.020 --> 01:42:50.380]  allowed to come into this country in exchange for some cooperation against
[01:42:50.380 --> 01:42:54.900]  the Zetas which as you know is made up of military deserters and other really
[01:42:54.900 --> 01:43:00.180]  hardcore guys and that's just their cover in the in the Texas newspapers that
[01:43:00.180 --> 01:43:04.580]  oh we let in this tonnage of cocaine and yeah Wachovia and Wells Fargo run these
[01:43:04.580 --> 01:43:08.940]  aircraft with cocaine and yeah I mean it's totally controlled and actually the
[01:43:08.940 --> 01:43:12.500]  big banks in the US and not the US government if you read all the federal
[01:43:12.500 --> 01:43:15.580]  documents that are admitted they're funding all the cartels against each
[01:43:15.580 --> 01:43:21.740]  other to try to just keep prices up it's so cold-blooded and I don't know what
[01:43:21.740 --> 01:43:25.340]  the end game is I mean if they did succeed in destroying the country
[01:43:25.340 --> 01:43:28.980]  reducing this is some sort of a brawling internally brawling third world
[01:43:28.980 --> 01:43:33.140]  nation I mean what is to be gained from this I just don't know I think it might
[01:43:33.140 --> 01:43:35.780]  it might go back to I mean I keep quoting movies but again it's the
[01:43:35.780 --> 01:43:39.780]  brilliant screenwriters I think it's true I don't think some of these people
[01:43:39.780 --> 01:43:45.540]  can be can it can be assigned any other motive or initiative other than they
[01:43:45.540 --> 01:43:51.980]  just like to see the world burn I hope not but but I don't understand what
[01:43:51.980 --> 01:43:56.940]  they want I mean I don't think I'm smart enough to scrutinize what they want
[01:43:56.940 --> 01:44:03.460]  no John John you're you're totally sharp as a razor and you're just being
[01:44:03.460 --> 01:44:06.980]  self-deprecating you just hit the no on the head you brought up Hitler earlier
[01:44:06.980 --> 01:44:13.500]  I've seen the German film reels in the German where Hitler would would during
[01:44:13.500 --> 01:44:16.980]  the first few years the war would travel out by his armored train and for
[01:44:16.980 --> 01:44:21.500]  sometimes 24-hour straight drinking coffee and eating pastries would look
[01:44:21.500 --> 01:44:25.940]  through high-powered telescopes and binoculars at at Warsaw burning or other
[01:44:25.940 --> 01:44:30.620]  cities burning they like to watch the world burn like Nero they've got all
[01:44:30.620 --> 01:44:34.260]  this power and when you let corruption take over the worst elements end up
[01:44:34.260 --> 01:44:39.700]  filling the the gap and then even more elements fill that and it's almost like
[01:44:39.700 --> 01:44:45.500]  an indie 500 of evil only the most evil end up in control and they like black
[01:44:45.500 --> 01:44:51.260]  uniforms death carnage war skulls murder death whether it's Los Zetas or
[01:44:51.260 --> 01:44:54.900]  skull and bones they worship a grim reaper with a gold crown on its head
[01:44:54.900 --> 01:44:59.340]  they like they like grim reapers man that's what it looks like to me it
[01:44:59.340 --> 01:45:03.100]  really does I mean notice what the what the SWAT uniforms look like that they're
[01:45:03.100 --> 01:45:07.740]  carrying it you know German made machine guns they got German style helmets and
[01:45:07.740 --> 01:45:11.140]  they got some great looking black uniforms and they just personify you
[01:45:11.140 --> 01:45:15.300]  know you know you know part of the psychological warfare that's been
[01:45:15.300 --> 01:45:18.740]  waged against us is at least the Greeks you know if you study any kind of
[01:45:18.740 --> 01:45:23.300]  theater at all you're gonna study the Greek theater and it's because number
[01:45:23.300 --> 01:45:27.340]  one the stories never never change however with the Greeks at least they
[01:45:27.340 --> 01:45:31.740]  had the sense that all sex and violence was done off stage it was only suggested
[01:45:31.740 --> 01:45:35.220]  and they also have enough sense to put masks on everybody so that you don't go
[01:45:35.220 --> 01:45:39.660]  well I know that guy is a completely disgusting horrible amoral person but
[01:45:39.660 --> 01:45:43.060]  he's so handsome you know then the girls fall in love with him and then this
[01:45:43.060 --> 01:45:46.580]  of this horrible vixen that's just a you know blood thirsty and a horrible
[01:45:46.580 --> 01:45:50.780]  individual she's beautiful so we really like her even though she's morally like
[01:45:50.780 --> 01:45:55.700]  bereft that they had enough sense to disguise that so that you just got the
[01:45:55.700 --> 01:46:00.220]  story unlike what we're fed I mean we're continually desensitized I mean what
[01:46:00.220 --> 01:46:06.460]  next on TV the last episode of 24 with Kiefer was I think he actually disemboweled
[01:46:06.460 --> 01:46:10.700]  somebody while the camera was was was taping him and I'm just like good god
[01:46:10.700 --> 01:46:14.460]  what next I mean I was watching something just just channel surf for the
[01:46:14.460 --> 01:46:18.900]  other day and I saw so much violence all over the place that I thought I don't
[01:46:18.900 --> 01:46:23.420]  know which is sicker them putting it on the screen or me sitting here watching
[01:46:23.420 --> 01:46:27.300]  it so I just turned the bloody thing off and then let it go we're being
[01:46:27.300 --> 01:46:32.020]  desensitized to what's to come is the only thing I can figure out apparently
[01:46:32.020 --> 01:46:35.900]  there are some really smart people that are all talking to each other and this
[01:46:35.900 --> 01:46:42.780]  is a huge orchestrated campaign the end of which I guess is it's just flames I
[01:46:42.780 --> 01:46:47.580]  mean if I think we're about to get on the same page and decide that if you do
[01:46:47.580 --> 01:46:51.180]  believe let me just qualify this real quick on some of the blogs that comment
[01:46:51.180 --> 01:46:53.620]  about some of the things that have been said on coast to coast where I reach
[01:46:53.620 --> 01:46:57.540]  them or the most audience obviously nobody a lot of people go and get a drink
[01:46:57.540 --> 01:47:01.740]  of water during a commercial or something else but it's like all this
[01:47:01.740 --> 01:47:05.380]  whales guy sounds like a fundamentalist Christian and a right-winger it's like
[01:47:05.380 --> 01:47:09.420]  well if my belief in Jesus Christ makes me a fundamentalist fundamentalist
[01:47:09.420 --> 01:47:14.460]  Christian and if my belief that if we let go of this Constitution we are over
[01:47:14.460 --> 01:47:18.220]  with well then I guess that makes me a right-winger you know because we're
[01:47:18.220 --> 01:47:22.740]  losing this Constitution and once it's gone what can happen in this country
[01:47:22.740 --> 01:47:25.700]  with the advances in technology and all the facilities and everything else that
[01:47:25.700 --> 01:47:29.700]  have been built and are ready to make Nazi Germany look like mr. Rogers
[01:47:29.700 --> 01:47:34.500]  neighborhood that's my opinion no you're right this high-tech overlay over
[01:47:34.500 --> 01:47:40.140]  ancient forms of tyranny is so scientific and so evil and we haven't
[01:47:40.140 --> 01:47:42.980]  even done this TV peach yet for the nightly news because there's so many
[01:47:42.980 --> 01:47:48.340]  examples we've been just taping TV and then pausing it sharpie commercials now
[01:47:48.340 --> 01:47:55.180]  we'll have stuff like don't protest flashed on the screen TV shows like what
[01:47:55.180 --> 01:47:59.420]  it's called Breaking Bad episode after episode we'll have subliminal sing Ron
[01:47:59.420 --> 01:48:05.700]  Paul's a drughead I mean the fact that there is this this bold with it but
[01:48:05.700 --> 01:48:10.500]  expanding you heard about the VA cemetery one of the biggest in the country
[01:48:10.500 --> 01:48:17.180]  in Houston and it's now come out even the Dallas Morning News that first the
[01:48:17.180 --> 01:48:21.580]  military denied this was happening but the head of the place said whether your
[01:48:21.580 --> 01:48:25.700]  Christian Muslim Jewish it didn't matter you couldn't pray over somebody's
[01:48:25.700 --> 01:48:32.820]  casket at their burial and she turned the the director turned the the chapel
[01:48:32.820 --> 01:48:36.580]  into a broom closet and would tell them and when people brought this up they
[01:48:36.580 --> 01:48:40.740]  said it's not true so the local group had to sue and it turned out that the
[01:48:40.740 --> 01:48:44.780]  Department of Defense had beta tested not allowing anybody to pray at the
[01:48:44.780 --> 01:48:48.220]  cemetery saying separation of church and state when that's a letter from Thomas
[01:48:48.220 --> 01:48:51.820]  Jefferson saying we don't need a state-run religion the first amendment
[01:48:51.820 --> 01:48:56.580]  says government can't make a law making you follow a certain religion but of
[01:48:56.580 --> 01:49:03.220]  course if you can have people pray at their funeral at the cemetery I mean it
[01:49:03.220 --> 01:49:07.100]  shows how these atheists that was the official religion of the Soviet Union
[01:49:07.100 --> 01:49:11.700]  what tyrants they are sir well you know I'm absolutely on the same page with you
[01:49:11.700 --> 01:49:14.660]  all this separate what separation church and state it's like you don't know what
[01:49:14.660 --> 01:49:19.300]  you're talking about it the separation of church and state refers only to the
[01:49:19.300 --> 01:49:25.660]  establishment by our government of a national religion that's all like as in
[01:49:25.660 --> 01:49:28.860]  King Henry VIII did when he wanted to get rid of what's her name and Mary wanted
[01:49:28.860 --> 01:49:32.940]  to get rid of Catherine and and pick up on and he made his own church he had the
[01:49:32.940 --> 01:49:38.100]  power to do so he divorced himself from Rome sort of and just got the I mean he
[01:49:38.100 --> 01:49:41.860]  had to have the air exactly so he created the Church of England but this is
[01:49:41.860 --> 01:49:46.020]  what's crazy though is that I see reports all the time where a child brings a
[01:49:46.020 --> 01:49:49.860]  Bible to school in their bag and they take it and throw it the trash like you
[01:49:49.860 --> 01:49:54.500]  can't have this but you can wear the devil t-shirt or whatever again it's the
[01:49:54.500 --> 01:49:59.900]  idea that that certain speech can be banned and it shows what tyrants these
[01:49:59.900 --> 01:50:03.740]  people are well it's all I think it in the end it's gonna boil down to one
[01:50:03.740 --> 01:50:07.340]  thing you know people look to the Mayan calendar to look to Nostradamus
[01:50:07.340 --> 01:50:10.100]  though you know all these people are looking for the truth somewhere other
[01:50:10.100 --> 01:50:16.580]  than in their Bible but in the end it comes down to good and evil that's what
[01:50:16.580 --> 01:50:20.820]  the study of philosophy is about is the whole the entire school of philosophy is
[01:50:20.820 --> 01:50:26.500]  devoted to one thing what makes a good life now if blood and guts and murder
[01:50:26.500 --> 01:50:29.220]  on every street corners your idea of a good life then you've got a pretty
[01:50:29.220 --> 01:50:35.220]  warped philosophy but these philosophies do exist and I think it is natural that
[01:50:35.220 --> 01:50:39.500]  we have these opposing forces you know but let's let's say just for the sake
[01:50:39.500 --> 01:50:41.900]  of the sake of the argument. Stay there amazing and I'm gonna see if I can twist your arm

[01:54:37.420 --> 01:54:39.820]  you were making a point as we went to break do you have to remember what that
[01:54:39.820 --> 01:54:43.580]  was john i know it was interesting well it was just that the people who go to all
[01:54:43.580 --> 01:54:48.700]  these other sources to find out what's happening in their lives
[01:54:48.700 --> 01:54:52.460]  every day a person's mind is filled with all kinds of things all
[01:54:52.460 --> 01:54:55.020]  this i in fact i'm surprised that we're not all insane
[01:54:55.020 --> 01:54:58.620]  you know that's why we go to pastoral places you know fields and beaches and
[01:54:58.620 --> 01:55:01.580]  stuff like that we just we get some natural beauty but here in the in the
[01:55:01.580 --> 01:55:07.180]  cities and so forth we're hit with television radio signs lights
[01:55:07.180 --> 01:55:09.980]  other signs traffic all these people you know
[01:55:09.980 --> 01:55:13.820]  have you noticed everything is turning to like a time square even in small
[01:55:13.820 --> 01:55:17.340]  towns with tv's and janet napolitano in the walmart
[01:55:17.340 --> 01:55:20.300]  other facilities saying don't trust anyone but me
[01:55:20.300 --> 01:55:23.500]  don't trust your neighbors don't worry checkpoints are coming
[01:55:23.500 --> 01:55:27.580]  oh it's like a thx 1138 you know where the guy comes on it goes my time is your
[01:55:27.580 --> 01:55:30.700]  time consume and joy i mean is that is that what we
[01:55:30.700 --> 01:55:33.580]  have become now as a nation of consumers well that's about to be over with
[01:55:33.580 --> 01:55:36.620]  because because this is turning it turning into
[01:55:36.620 --> 01:55:40.300]  a kind of a mutant form of a depression you know my
[01:55:40.300 --> 01:55:45.180]  my dad was a depression error kid and um and he said well the thing is
[01:55:45.180 --> 01:55:48.940]  is the money was worth something the problem was nobody had any
[01:55:48.940 --> 01:55:51.900]  well now we've got a two-pronged problem and that is
[01:55:51.900 --> 01:55:55.900]  nobody has any and even if they did things that used to go into nominations of
[01:55:55.900 --> 01:56:00.140]  a hundred dollars are now going into nominations of a thousand dollars so
[01:56:00.140 --> 01:56:04.540]  i don't know the money is being created with the stroke of a pen which means
[01:56:04.540 --> 01:56:09.580]  it's worth nothing so where do you go from there
[01:56:09.580 --> 01:56:13.100]  one of the brightest guys i thought i wish i could remember his name at this
[01:56:13.100 --> 01:56:17.340]  moment i'm so 80 days at times but i said look what is money once upon a
[01:56:17.340 --> 01:56:20.460]  time it used to be an agreement to exchange goods or services he says
[01:56:20.460 --> 01:56:23.660]  well that's true he said but more than that
[01:56:23.660 --> 01:56:29.580]  it's a social compact and that really set the dominoes fallen then because
[01:56:29.580 --> 01:56:33.420]  yeah and who is the compact between at the at now
[01:56:33.420 --> 01:56:37.660]  when all of these these banks go okay i mean i think we're being smokescreen
[01:56:37.660 --> 01:56:40.140]  with all the trouble are in these various nations i think the trouble that
[01:56:40.140 --> 01:56:43.980]  these various nations like Greece and Spain the other ones
[01:56:43.980 --> 01:56:47.900]  i think all of this is fabricated i mean i really do know it is if you get into
[01:56:47.900 --> 01:56:51.580]  the documents it is and instead of the government issuing a fiat currency
[01:56:51.580 --> 01:56:54.780]  that's dangerous because they can hyperinflate
[01:56:54.780 --> 01:56:58.220]  but if it's connected to something you know generally that's a more successful
[01:56:58.220 --> 01:57:02.460]  system than letting private central banks control the currency and so in the
[01:57:02.460 --> 01:57:05.500]  compact for the money to exist you have to become a
[01:57:05.500 --> 01:57:09.820]  debt slave the money becomes god
[01:57:09.820 --> 01:57:13.100]  and those that issue it become rulers of the universe basically
[01:57:13.100 --> 01:57:16.700]  and now they implode societies to consolidate them and now
[01:57:16.700 --> 01:57:20.620]  they're moving in to start banning cash the forces on the cashless systems
[01:57:20.620 --> 01:57:24.700]  so they can charge us and track us i mean if people think five dollars to use
[01:57:24.700 --> 01:57:28.540]  their credit card or ATM is something wait till it's totally cashless
[01:57:28.540 --> 01:57:32.460]  we're going to be held totally hostage where you actually pay massive money
[01:57:32.460 --> 01:57:36.380]  just to keep your money in a bank well not only that but i mean wouldn't be
[01:57:36.380 --> 01:57:39.020]  interesting if all of a sudden now instead of writing a checker pulled out a
[01:57:39.020 --> 01:57:42.620]  credit card now we have to show id if we produce cash
[01:57:42.620 --> 01:57:46.540]  no no that's the plan under the 999 that's the plan yeah
[01:57:46.540 --> 01:57:49.660]  i mean i challenge anybody to come up with a more ridiculous scenario
[01:57:49.660 --> 01:57:53.740]  you know the man's name was manning that i that i interviewed on coast to coast
[01:57:53.740 --> 01:57:57.100]  last name is manning and his first name is casey this moment i'll get it back
[01:57:57.100 --> 01:57:59.820]  for the other of our time together here but uh
[01:57:59.820 --> 01:58:03.980]  but i said are we doing some sort of an economy have crop rotation you farm
[01:58:03.980 --> 01:58:06.700]  this part out so you let it rest a couple years move over to another plot and
[01:58:06.700 --> 01:58:11.820]  farm that are we doing economy rotation now and he said uh yeah sorted and this
[01:58:11.820 --> 01:58:14.380]  economy is pretty much tapped out so we're gonna
[01:58:14.380 --> 01:58:18.220]  now china is the big dog and and then they're new at this i'd i give them 10
[01:58:18.220 --> 01:58:21.340]  years or not even that five years before something bad
[01:58:21.340 --> 01:58:24.460]  happens over there uh well stay there five more
[01:58:24.460 --> 01:58:27.660]  minutes i totally agree with you and again it's not like crop rotation where
[01:58:27.660 --> 01:58:31.180]  it produces something it's designed to build up get in
[01:58:31.180 --> 01:58:35.340]  debt and then destroy because again you don't want any country to be strong
[01:58:35.340 --> 01:58:41.260]  you only want the global parasite banks we'll be right back stay with us

[02:01:28.860 --> 02:01:34.540]  allow yourself to hear it and i think he said that they use the the term new world order over 100
[02:01:34.540 --> 02:01:41.100]  times in his administration that's that's a frightening in itself but um but again there's
[02:01:41.100 --> 02:01:47.020]  there's no uh there's no doubt that this is an orchestrated effort it's it's it's look it's
[02:01:47.020 --> 02:01:53.180]  undeniable nobody wants it people just want to live their lives and go along make a little
[02:01:53.180 --> 02:01:58.620]  money enjoy their families isn't that but that's what we got to do well instead of just pushing back
[02:01:58.620 --> 02:02:04.220]  to get them off our backs we've got to route these parasite control freaks out just like when
[02:02:04.220 --> 02:02:09.980]  they try to tell people you know your grandpa in world war two veteran dies you go to the houston
[02:02:09.980 --> 02:02:14.220]  va cemetery one of the biggest in the country and they say you can't have a priest or a pastor here
[02:02:14.220 --> 02:02:19.500]  to pray you've got to get aggressive and and go after them in the federal court first the pentagon
[02:02:19.500 --> 02:02:25.580]  denied it turned out they'd ordered it again they're they're always behind the scenes trying to create
[02:02:25.580 --> 02:02:31.260]  basically a soviet america for the bankers they don't want freedom and they want to have population
[02:02:31.260 --> 02:02:36.300]  reduction and they want to shut down our free speech that's why it's so important now to support
[02:02:36.300 --> 02:02:41.340]  alternative media more than ever uh in closing what's your view on the internet kill switch and
[02:02:41.340 --> 02:02:45.900]  fema coming up later this month next month testing takeover systems of radio
[02:02:46.540 --> 02:02:50.700]  well it's it's it's just they're going to begin rubbing it in our faces now because we haven't
[02:02:50.700 --> 02:02:54.700]  been able to stop them from doing it except in isolated cases we haven't been able to stop them
[02:02:54.700 --> 02:03:01.580]  from from uh invading our privacy just everybody keep in mind that while they are able to log every
[02:03:01.580 --> 02:03:07.980]  keystroke every email everything that you do is stored somewhere including conversations on your
[02:03:07.980 --> 02:03:15.340]  cell phone uh just remember something old chicago criminal lawyer told me one time who's recently
[02:03:15.340 --> 02:03:21.340]  uh passed away don't ever say anything over a phone or in an email or a text message that you
[02:03:21.340 --> 02:03:27.580]  wouldn't want repeated or played back in front of a federal grand jury so just let discretion be your
[02:03:27.580 --> 02:03:35.020]  guide but more than that reconnect with your true character whatever that is good character or bad
[02:03:35.020 --> 02:03:43.260]  character pick a side we're out of time we're out of time it's just about game time so decide what
[02:03:43.260 --> 02:03:47.100]  side you're going to be on and go there if you're going to be one of these people out there that says

[02:03:50.380 --> 02:03:54.460]  to give it to me forget about it you're not going to get it the only thing that you're going to get
[02:03:54.460 --> 02:03:58.860]  is what you're given you're not going to be able to make a life for yourself it's going to be made
[02:03:58.860 --> 02:04:04.780]  for you and then what you're assigned an apartment you're assigned a little card as to whether or
[02:04:04.780 --> 02:04:10.060]  not you can even drive a car is that what if that's the life you want just sit there and do nothing

[02:09:06.220 --> 02:09:14.140]  think because ladies and gentlemen when we live as cowards we invite destruction and again it's not
[02:09:14.140 --> 02:09:20.940]  sold as cowardice it's play ball go along to get along be friendly don't make waves that doesn't
[02:09:20.940 --> 02:09:28.540]  create waves for a while but then when the waves do come they're 10 times bigger okay and i'm all
[02:09:28.540 --> 02:09:34.540]  in i mean i realize a few times in my life i've passed spiritual points in my life i pass one of
[02:09:34.540 --> 02:09:41.900]  those when i spoke to the builderberg group bullhorn them and holbrook came out uh there uh at uh
[02:09:41.900 --> 02:09:49.580]  the 2006 canada builderberg meeting i felt that that that rubicon i was passing i felt that rubicon
[02:09:49.580 --> 02:09:55.180]  when i was at the dallas fed a week and a half ago and and the crew felt it too and now we've
[02:09:55.180 --> 02:09:59.820]  learned there was people there trying to set off a bomb uh reportedly we're going to try to find out
[02:09:59.820 --> 02:10:04.140]  exactly what happened with that and what that federal provocateur was up to i've got to track
[02:10:04.140 --> 02:10:07.980]  all that down but we're talking to the witnesses and people right as i was arriving but they ran
[02:10:07.980 --> 02:10:12.860]  the person off this just shows you the level of evil we're facing the federal reserve is trying
[02:10:12.860 --> 02:10:18.300]  to shut down my youtube channel right now uh because of the with this privacy complaint that
[02:10:18.300 --> 02:10:25.100]  i'm violating their privacy but that's before the youtube board right now um i can feel it
[02:10:25.980 --> 02:10:31.740]  that i'm passing into a whole new level of danger but also opportunity and i'm just
[02:10:31.740 --> 02:10:41.660]  i'm almost nostalgic for not living in this type of danger but i understand it is a mind trick
[02:10:41.660 --> 02:10:46.460]  you're in the danger whether you admit it or not letting the system continue along its path
[02:10:46.460 --> 02:10:53.580]  towards total global meltdown that is is a much greater danger to the species to my children
[02:10:53.580 --> 02:11:01.020]  to your children and this is a time to be all in now we are listeners supported but the sponsors
[02:11:01.020 --> 02:11:06.220]  with the online video apparel bookstore video store at info wars dot com with the prison planet
[02:11:06.220 --> 02:11:11.420]  dot tv memberships it was four years ago that listeners started a money bomb
[02:11:12.140 --> 02:11:16.780]  and uh it started getting a lot of attention i learned people had pledged several hundred
[02:11:16.780 --> 02:11:21.020]  thousand dollars so i got behind it like two days before and with that three hundred thousand
[02:11:21.020 --> 02:11:26.620]  dollars we raised i was able to begin the process to move into a bigger office then the next couple
[02:11:26.620 --> 02:11:33.820]  money bombs we were able to build this structure hire the people uh and build the tv studio and
[02:11:33.820 --> 02:11:40.140]  now we've gotten to the point where we need this money bomb around 20 of the money each year now
[02:11:40.140 --> 02:11:44.540]  that we need to run this operation you know it takes millions of dollars to run this people then
[02:11:44.540 --> 02:11:49.340]  go what you're making millions no no i'm it takes millions to run this understand that's the cost
[02:11:49.340 --> 02:11:55.020]  of running this operation and uh we have now uh a little bit late this year that we're going to
[02:11:55.020 --> 02:12:00.460]  webster tarply a little bit late this year launched it normally i promoted a month out but
[02:12:00.460 --> 02:12:07.500]  i've been so busy with the nightly news so busy with special reports uh so busy with everything
[02:12:08.460 --> 02:12:15.580]  that we're launching this just um what like 14 days before and so you can start donating now if
[02:12:15.580 --> 02:12:21.900]  you'd like to uh we're going to broadcast 24 hours again with special guest and a lot more coming up
[02:12:21.900 --> 02:12:28.540]  on the third in fact they have the date on there i just finally saw uh this morning this site completed
[02:12:28.540 --> 02:12:34.460]  this morning uh and uh you can be the first to donate via credit card paypal you can also mail
[02:12:34.460 --> 02:12:45.820]  in your donations uh now uh to our address uh here info wars po box 19549 austin texas 78760

[02:13:00.940 --> 02:13:05.660]  and if you scroll down it's a rocket i you know i told the folks let's not do a radio tower
[02:13:06.700 --> 02:13:12.460]  because somehow folks thought that was a pyramid or something but i said obviously with a thermometer
[02:13:12.460 --> 02:13:19.660]  or something it's got to be you know a top-down symbol uh so it's a rocket a buck roger style
[02:13:19.660 --> 02:13:24.140]  rocket i had set a Saturn rocket with at the missile gantry but this is what they came up with
[02:13:24.140 --> 02:13:29.500]  i think it's better than my idea it's kind of an old bugs bunny skull rabbit uh you know uh
[02:13:29.500 --> 02:13:35.100]  warner brothers a rocket uh the type that blasts off from caper and everl actually looks like a
[02:13:35.100 --> 02:13:41.020]  verner von brawn v1 or v6 i forget the name of those the point is it looks like a 1940s rocket
[02:13:41.020 --> 02:13:47.420]  and the goal is $500,000 sounds like a lot but we need to hire four or five more reporters
[02:13:47.420 --> 02:13:52.940]  servers equipment uh satellite uplink type systems and we're going to be shooting a video that shows
[02:13:52.940 --> 02:13:58.300]  what we've done the last 16 years what we've done the last four years of money bombs what we've built
[02:13:59.020 --> 02:14:03.020]  going to the next level that's why it's a rocket we're trying to go to the next level
[02:14:03.020 --> 02:14:09.420]  we're trying to blast off and escape the globalist you know clutches trying to escape the god of this
[02:14:09.420 --> 02:14:15.500]  world i guess and get outside of this system and up into valhalla so again the new website
[02:14:15.500 --> 02:14:19.260]  if you want to check it out there'll be videos up there in the next few days i'm even shoot a
[02:14:19.260 --> 02:14:24.380]  quick one today but the highly produced one will be up the next few days is info wars money bomb
[02:14:24.380 --> 02:14:31.020]  dot com info wars money bomb dot com or you could simply go to info wars dot com forward slash
[02:14:31.020 --> 02:14:37.100]  money bomb uh and start donating today uh now uh we're gonna probably get pechenik on about 40
[02:14:37.100 --> 02:14:41.340]  after because i really want to have some time with tarply and i also need to get into promoting
[02:14:41.340 --> 02:14:46.620]  this money bomb please help us get the word out about it because we are the alternative media
[02:14:46.620 --> 02:14:51.580]  we are the tip of the spear we're doing something no one else is doing no one else has done or ever
[02:14:51.580 --> 02:14:56.460]  done what we're doing at this level uh we're the best there is doesn't mean doesn't mean i'm that
[02:14:56.460 --> 02:15:02.140]  good my crew is great but i'm doing the best i can okay and we need your support to get this done
[02:15:02.140 --> 02:15:07.420]  so fuel our rocket so it can blast off i think they said that once it goes to 500 000 the rocket
[02:15:07.420 --> 02:15:14.220]  does take off so uh we'll see if we meet our goal this year we came in about 60 000 of it last year
[02:15:14.220 --> 02:15:18.540]  and i didn't just claim that we made our goal and you know add the fiat made up money in there
[02:15:19.820 --> 02:15:28.220]  but we need to reach our goal this year to really be able to continue uh confidently and expand some
[02:15:28.220 --> 02:15:32.940]  which is what i want to do obviously the economy is going into freefall now shifting gears he was
[02:15:32.940 --> 02:15:38.460]  just there a few months ago under bombardment they've said Muammar Gaddafi is dead he did promise to
[02:15:38.460 --> 02:15:43.900]  stay and fight would have been lauding thing we know that was fake because of the evidence with
[02:15:43.900 --> 02:15:50.220]  this i don't know uh and uh again al-qaeda has been given all these service to air missiles now
[02:15:50.220 --> 02:15:55.340]  so we're told we have to have domestic checkpoints on highways as i told you they would do to stop
[02:15:55.340 --> 02:16:00.140]  the al-qaeda missiles that were given to al-qaeda that's been given libya so to break this down joining
[02:16:00.140 --> 02:16:06.380]  us via video skype is webster griffin tarpley historian uh and also economist uh webster what
[02:16:06.380 --> 02:16:12.940]  do you make of this hi alex well certainly it's a it's a horrifying spectacle whatever the reality
[02:16:12.940 --> 02:16:21.020]  is right to see all of this gloating and um disgusting uh celebration about uh the alleged
[02:16:21.020 --> 02:16:27.100]  death of Gaddafi now let's stress this is alleged and it's coming from sources that are notoriously
[02:16:27.100 --> 02:16:33.900]  unreliable that is to say the transitional national council the people that nato has appointed as the
[02:16:33.900 --> 02:16:40.780]  puppet rulers of the country uh there are now two stories that seem to be competing uh i think the
[02:16:40.780 --> 02:16:48.700]  basic reality is there was some kind of a uh motorcade of Gaddafi forces of some kind that was
[02:16:48.700 --> 02:16:54.220]  bombed by nato because that is the operative arm of what's going on in the area of sirta where
[02:16:54.220 --> 02:17:02.220]  after two months since the the nato invasion of tripoli they were closing this pocket at the
[02:17:02.220 --> 02:17:08.860]  inside of sirta and certain Gaddafi forces were apparently attempting to get out so there's a story
[02:17:08.860 --> 02:17:15.820]  that this person's convoy was bombed by nato aircraft and then there's an embroidered story
[02:17:15.820 --> 02:17:21.260]  which seems to borrow from the Saddam Hussein which is that Gaddafi had taken refuge in a drainage
[02:17:21.260 --> 02:17:27.660]  pipe underground now i stress again it's all alleged by some of the yeah that's done and not
[02:17:27.660 --> 02:17:33.580]  make him look like a guy dying on the battlefield but hiding as a rat i mean that's classic psychological
[02:17:33.580 --> 02:17:38.940]  warfare he's called them deservedly they have been called rats and vermin all around the world
[02:17:38.940 --> 02:17:44.060]  and they are so they want to be able to apply that to him that he's a sewer rat and so forth
[02:17:44.060 --> 02:17:48.620]  you have to remember somebody like Gaddafi he's not called the desert fox for nothing
[02:17:48.620 --> 02:17:54.380]  and somebody like this i think is likely to have doubles right the so-called doppelganger so if you
[02:17:54.380 --> 02:17:59.980]  have doubles maybe if you're going to take a position in sirta you must have a double or two with
[02:17:59.980 --> 02:18:04.620]  you so the question is now at the moment where the siege comes to an end where the siege can't be
[02:18:04.620 --> 02:18:12.780]  maintained because of nato bombing then did these rebels kill a double or did they kill Gaddafi now
[02:18:12.780 --> 02:18:20.700]  the other question is we can see on al jazeera and agence france press they have films of Gaddafi
[02:18:20.700 --> 02:18:27.260]  being captured alive apparently wounded or alive again an individual purporting or they claim is
[02:18:27.260 --> 02:18:33.020]  Gaddafi captured alive this person is then loaded into what looks like a pickup truck or they call
[02:18:33.020 --> 02:18:39.580]  it an ambulance i don't know being obviously harassed by these these terrorist al qaeda goons
[02:18:39.580 --> 02:18:45.260]  and then later on they show you pictures of the of the same person allegedly dead so
[02:18:45.260 --> 02:18:50.540]  a massive contradictions even hillary clinton who was of course eager to gloat when she was
[02:18:50.540 --> 02:18:55.420]  told about this said well of course we've heard fantastic stories from these people before in
[02:18:55.420 --> 02:19:02.060]  fact we heard he was killed inside of his compound a few months ago uh and and we heard he ran to
[02:19:02.060 --> 02:19:08.620]  venezuela and all of this uh also we know the rebels have been losing quite a bit so this could be a
[02:19:08.620 --> 02:19:13.100]  propaganda coup or he could have been killed in some other african country when the special
[02:19:13.100 --> 02:19:17.820]  forces went down to yaganda last week i mean the truth is when we've been lied to by a group
[02:19:17.820 --> 02:19:22.460]  over and over again we can't believe a word they say so we just don't know precisely there there is
[02:19:22.460 --> 02:19:28.540]  now this this air of mystery i believe obama obama wanted to hang back and gloat last because we
[02:19:28.540 --> 02:19:33.900]  thought socozy gloating by the way he's he's speaking right now uh yeah so obama's on right
[02:19:33.900 --> 02:19:39.580]  now but he he waited because everybody else has now gone first banky moon went first uh madame
[02:19:39.580 --> 02:19:45.420]  ashton of the european union uh haig the foreign secretary socozy of course trying to get out there
[02:19:45.420 --> 02:19:51.180]  in front now obama comes last which is also his stealth profile in this entire thing so let us
[02:19:51.180 --> 02:19:55.340]  just bracket this now let's just stay there stay there i want to get your analysis straight ahead

[02:24:13.580 --> 02:24:19.820]  okay so obama just finished speaking a few minutes ago uh el presidente and maybe he's
[02:24:19.820 --> 02:24:25.420]  a qaddafi double because he pulled that gene Simmons photo uh right next to qaddafi i mean
[02:24:25.420 --> 02:24:31.180]  he does have a lot of a lot of doubles gene gene Simmons has been a rumor to uh to actually be qaddafi
[02:24:31.180 --> 02:24:34.940]  there's even a better one than that where he looks just like qaddafi we're showing it to
[02:24:34.940 --> 02:24:40.540]  prison planet dot tv viewers uh but uh by the way there's a story i want to get into it's up at
[02:24:40.540 --> 02:24:46.620]  the drudge report dot com on the bottom of the left hand side it's our article um it says uh
[02:24:46.620 --> 02:24:52.300]  egypt's top facebook revolutionary now advising so the state department has their guy advising
[02:24:52.300 --> 02:24:57.420]  occupy wall street i want to get into that color revolution uh as well and where you see that going
[02:24:57.420 --> 02:25:06.300]  but finishing up go nim yes but but but finishing up with uh with a qaddafi go ahead look uh
[02:25:07.260 --> 02:25:11.260]  let's let's assume for the moment that these reports are true we don't we don't know uh
[02:25:11.260 --> 02:25:17.020]  uh one question is then what's with the succession uh one some of these reports say
[02:25:17.020 --> 02:25:23.340]  another son of qaddafi motasin has been either killed or captured then there's saif he's principally
[02:25:23.340 --> 02:25:30.460]  the the political heir to to qaddafi the father so saif al islam what's with him they have stories
[02:25:30.460 --> 02:25:36.460]  now his motorcade is surrounded and uh he's going to be captured who knows right maybe that's him
[02:25:36.460 --> 02:25:43.100]  maybe that's a double for him uh there's also then kamis kamis reported dead by some asserted to be
[02:25:43.100 --> 02:25:49.260]  alive by others certainly alive is aisha the daughter she's i believe in algea so a lot of this
[02:25:49.260 --> 02:25:55.340]  goes on there's also musa ibrahim the very courageous and capable spokesperson for the uh for the
[02:25:55.340 --> 02:26:00.940]  qaddafi regime and he is also uh continuing to operate and some messages may come through
[02:26:00.940 --> 02:26:07.340]  syria watch that rai channel in in syria but now assuming qaddafi is out of the picture what
[02:26:07.340 --> 02:26:13.500]  happens well the obvious thing is this was the only thing that kept this rebel coalition together
[02:26:13.500 --> 02:26:18.460]  and the idea is this inside the rebel coalition you have two main groups one are the qaddafi
[02:26:18.460 --> 02:26:25.260]  renegades and the qaddafi retreads people who were ministers who then betrayed qaddafi so this would
[02:26:25.260 --> 02:26:30.860]  be jalil who is the head of state he's the head of the of the council and gibreel who's the head of
[02:26:30.860 --> 02:26:37.900]  government hillary clinton's boyfriend now gibreel has already said that he will quit when the war
[02:26:37.900 --> 02:26:43.740]  ends uh and from the other side you've got the al qaeda people right the actual terrorists the
[02:26:43.740 --> 02:26:48.780]  killers the people who have been fighting in uh and what i'm reading they're the dominant group
[02:26:48.780 --> 02:26:53.740]  and and now they're saying they've got thousands of shoulder launched uh service to air missiles so
[02:26:53.740 --> 02:26:58.620]  we've got to all give our rights up because the freedom fighters have missiles so the idea is you've
[02:26:58.620 --> 02:27:03.580]  got the qaddafi renegades and the qaddafi retreads on the one hand and that's the public international
[02:27:03.580 --> 02:27:08.620]  face of the new regime if that's what it is and on the other side you've got the killers the bloody
[02:27:08.620 --> 02:27:14.060]  handed al qaeda veterans who have been killing us forces and and carrying out acts of terrorism
[02:27:14.060 --> 02:27:19.260]  according to anybody's definition and at the top of that we seem to have this guy bel haj hasadi
[02:27:19.260 --> 02:27:24.540]  that i had identified back in in march and hasadi has he's done things like telling gibreel and
[02:27:24.540 --> 02:27:30.700]  jalil you guys get out or he but he barges into meetings and says remember you can't decide anything
[02:27:30.700 --> 02:27:36.860]  without me i'm bel haj hasadi and i'm i'm the top dog here in in triply so well it's also reported
[02:27:36.860 --> 02:27:42.860]  that qatar uh that their general is backing the al qaeda people yeah they have to choose sides and
[02:27:42.860 --> 02:27:47.100]  i guess maybe they want to be on the winning side but they say at these meetings the al qaeda guys
[02:27:47.100 --> 02:27:53.740]  have the general behind them and literally they say hey we've got the weapons sure so this looks
[02:27:53.740 --> 02:27:58.860]  like a a civil war brewing now the qaddafi side is the third side in the civil war and that i believe
[02:27:58.860 --> 02:28:04.780]  is the south right those the black guys in fezzan and the southern part uh remember a couple of days
[02:28:04.780 --> 02:28:10.540]  ago nato actually made a statement saying to african countries hey you guys in mali and in
[02:28:10.540 --> 02:28:18.780]  qad and in uh burkina faso or anyplace else sudan don't you dare give asylum to the qaddafi clan
[02:28:18.780 --> 02:28:24.620]  because we are coming after them right and we're nato and we're in your face so uh that has something
[02:28:24.620 --> 02:28:30.460]  as you're pointing out before something to do with this uganda story right that that obama is now up
[02:28:30.460 --> 02:28:38.620]  to seven wars right we've got iraq afghanistan libya pakistan yemen somalia and uganda which
[02:28:38.620 --> 02:28:44.300]  then becomes three more right now wait stop right there there's forces in columbia there's now us
[02:28:44.300 --> 02:28:50.780]  forces we've confirmed inside mexico 40 000 dead the last three years bigger than vietnam per year
[02:28:50.780 --> 02:28:56.380]  per capita i mean this is just full global invasion what's your count a dozen maybe we may be up to a
[02:28:56.380 --> 02:29:01.500]  dozen wars maybe 15 right with obama this guy's the limit does he get more peace prizes though
[02:29:01.500 --> 02:29:07.100]  if he gets a hundred i think they're going to institute a Nobel prize for hypocrisy and and
[02:29:07.100 --> 02:29:12.380]  and give it to him so this i think this is at the same time this is a horrible perspective
[02:29:12.380 --> 02:29:17.660]  for the people of libya remember what's going to happen now is economic liberalization they're
[02:29:17.660 --> 02:29:23.100]  going to get the joys of the free market oh boy they're going to get everything privatized that
[02:29:23.100 --> 02:29:28.780]  was not privatized and the oil will now be looted by that doesn't mean actually privatized it means
[02:29:28.780 --> 02:29:33.420]  handed over to the bankers stay there i want to finish up on the economy and i want to look at
[02:29:33.420 --> 02:29:38.140]  what's happening in europe and tie it into the us because they're announcing a long steep drop
[02:29:38.140 --> 02:29:45.020]  for american standard of living cnbc globalism means you're poor but you pay more taxes to the

[02:34:26.300 --> 02:34:31.180]  all these new agencies all these new control freaks who work for the offshore banks to
[02:34:31.180 --> 02:34:37.740]  assanguiate to suck dry the country to raise your taxes and then hand the infrastructure over
[02:34:37.740 --> 02:34:42.860]  to foreign banks who then will charge you for everything you paid to build now finishing up
[02:34:42.860 --> 02:34:47.980]  with libya now uh they can use that as the front door for the full african invasion
[02:34:48.620 --> 02:34:53.020]  as you said in the obama deception tarply now finishing up in one minute on that i want to
[02:34:53.020 --> 02:35:00.860]  then segue into the announcement of 70 plus trillion in bank of america in fact that article
[02:35:00.860 --> 02:35:04.620]  was here but i don't have it yes due to run it in he had it for the tv show tonight the bank of
[02:35:04.620 --> 02:35:10.460]  america 70 plus trillion backstop by the federal government our whole deficit's 14 trillion but
[02:35:10.460 --> 02:35:14.620]  but this is the privatization it's just give all our money to banks and then the banks tell us
[02:35:14.620 --> 02:35:20.860]  how to live our lives pretty good if you can get that work webster well the the problem of course
[02:35:20.860 --> 02:35:25.820]  is um everybody's complaining now right well occupy wall street they have a list of complaints
[02:35:25.820 --> 02:35:30.780]  everybody's got complaints and the big question is what do you do what's the action well you need
[02:35:30.780 --> 02:35:36.220]  a political mass movement to break the back of finance capital in the form of wall street uh
[02:35:36.220 --> 02:35:42.460]  frederick douglas once said power concedes nothing without a demand so you want to have
[02:35:42.460 --> 02:35:48.620]  political action have some demands uh obvious things nationalize the federal reserve impose
[02:35:48.620 --> 02:35:54.060]  that one percent wall street sales tax stop the cuts to the social safety net stop foreclosures
[02:35:54.060 --> 02:35:58.380]  and fraud closures that'll hit bank of america very hard because they're out there stealing
[02:35:58.380 --> 02:36:04.220]  people's uh people's uh people's homes rebuild the entire infrastructure be it road rail energy
[02:36:04.220 --> 02:36:10.460]  public building schools canals water systems and create 30 million new productive jobs in other words
[02:36:10.460 --> 02:36:15.500]  a mass strike a general strike growing out of the occupy wall street you got the only
[02:36:15.500 --> 02:36:21.580]  problem is you've got a sweep aside the current gaggle of counterinsurgency agents who are now
[02:36:21.580 --> 02:36:27.260]  running the show the people from ad busters the situation is international these pathetic
[02:36:27.260 --> 02:36:33.900]  indignados of madrid who are the biggest failures uh i had a lady on my show saying the indignados were
[02:36:33.900 --> 02:36:38.460]  a soap opera for zombies who thought they were making the revolution get those people out of
[02:36:38.460 --> 02:36:44.780]  there and where there are wherever you find facilitators and the general assembly and consensus
[02:36:44.780 --> 02:36:50.140]  kick them out go to the american method that's called majority rule and rights of the minority
[02:36:50.140 --> 02:36:56.140]  are taken care of get rid of the facilitators ask who is funded by foundations and if you are
[02:36:56.140 --> 02:37:01.340]  please leave get out uh that will that will clear the air enormous yeah but my thing is they want
[02:37:01.340 --> 02:37:06.940]  to push for austerity on the middle class to pay in banker bailouts and on the right they got herman
[02:37:06.940 --> 02:37:13.740]  came pushing a new sales tax on the people to track and and control everybody uh what do you make
[02:37:13.740 --> 02:37:19.180]  of the french and the germans not coming to an agreement because i've i've seen the the tentative
[02:37:19.180 --> 02:37:25.260]  agreements it's the total transfer of any sovereignty left in europe webster uh to this new
[02:37:25.260 --> 02:37:32.300]  private banking system that you'll pay your carbon taxes your vat to i mean they are really trying to
[02:37:32.300 --> 02:37:38.380]  do to europe what hitler couldn't do uh but because it's economic it's supposedly cutesy
[02:37:38.380 --> 02:37:41.900]  and we're being dominated by the ponzi scheme operators who are the ones that should go to
[02:37:41.900 --> 02:37:47.180]  prison if you look at the uh the dynamics of imposing austerity in europe there it's done
[02:37:47.180 --> 02:37:51.980]  under left-wing auspices i guess it's done that way here to at least under obama papandreou of
[02:37:51.980 --> 02:37:56.940]  greece the biggest agent of the international monetary fund is a socialist these from the
[02:37:56.940 --> 02:38:02.780]  socialist or second international used to be called the yellow international zap potato of spain same
[02:38:02.780 --> 02:38:07.900]  thing a socialist now it doesn't mean they're socialist these guys are bankers boys they're pure
[02:38:07.900 --> 02:38:13.100]  agents of finance capital but the rhetoric and the cover is so-called socialist uh you look at
[02:38:13.100 --> 02:38:17.980]  some of these other countries it gets to be the same thing the number one task there it's the same
[02:38:17.980 --> 02:38:22.780]  thing you want to do here kick out the agents don't let these people dominate they're having a
[02:38:22.780 --> 02:38:29.100]  general strike in greece it's the 12th the 13th or 14th time get rid of this papandreou get him
[02:38:29.100 --> 02:38:34.540]  out of there and if you get some right-wing monster and the pp or whatever this is called in in spain
[02:38:34.540 --> 02:38:40.620]  same story then you can have actual class struggle in a much clearer atmosphere some of the resistance
[02:38:40.620 --> 02:38:45.180]  in europe comes from german bankers and it's interesting uh this guy schoibela the guy you
[02:38:45.180 --> 02:38:51.500]  see sometimes in the wheelchair he says well these these uh bondholders need to take a haircut right
[02:38:51.500 --> 02:38:57.660]  they should they should get 20 or 50 or whatever percent lopped off their their bond holdings and
[02:38:57.660 --> 02:39:03.100]  of course trichet the outgoing head of the european central bank says horrors horrors we don't want
[02:39:03.100 --> 02:39:08.540]  any any austerity for the bank the bankers they say we want the sanctity of debt the sanctity of
[02:39:08.540 --> 02:39:13.500]  contracts if it's a labor contract they destroy it but if it's a contract with a bondholder then
[02:39:13.500 --> 02:39:19.980]  they say okay this has got to be sacrosanct well it won't work because these countries are in immediate
[02:39:19.980 --> 02:39:24.780]  need of a debt moratorium um something similar could happen here by the way you just take one
[02:39:24.780 --> 02:39:30.540]  trillion dollars of student loans and cancel them right and let those zombie bankers eat the losses
[02:39:30.540 --> 02:39:34.860]  otherwise you're not going to have another generation right we the the whole fat process of
[02:39:34.860 --> 02:39:39.660]  family formation and building careers and having children we're going to have a demographic crisis
[02:39:39.660 --> 02:39:45.420]  worse than we think because people are being crushed by their student loans so the idea is now
[02:39:45.420 --> 02:39:51.420]  the perspective of mass struggle lies open the mass strike period is here now get into it and
[02:39:51.420 --> 02:39:57.100]  intervene with a program kick out the agents kick out the facilitators and and start fighting for
[02:39:57.100 --> 02:40:01.660]  a problem all right well well look we're gonna have to get you back on to talk more about your
[02:40:01.660 --> 02:40:06.140]  idea for solutions but undoubtedly they admit the state department and others are running this
[02:40:06.140 --> 02:40:11.100]  occupy wall street thing in an attempt to have them just call for more taxes which is exactly what
[02:40:11.100 --> 02:40:16.220]  the megabanks want taxes what what tax the wall street sales tax is exactly what you want that's
[02:40:16.220 --> 02:40:22.060]  not what they're calling for they're calling for a sales tax wait wait wait who's day the nurses right
[02:40:22.060 --> 02:40:27.260]  american nurses united this is a militant union and they're good these are some fighting ladies
[02:40:27.260 --> 02:40:32.380]  they fought that pig schwarzenegger to a standstill in california and they're now intervening into
[02:40:32.380 --> 02:40:36.700]  these things saying we want to transfer a tax that means the wall street sales tax and the only
[02:40:36.700 --> 02:40:41.660]  reason that doesn't go through is because you got a bunch of facilitators these creeps the people
[02:40:41.660 --> 02:40:46.060]  who wouldn't let john louis come in and wreck everything they touch they wouldn't they wouldn't
[02:40:46.060 --> 02:40:49.900]  allow this stuff to be voted on because otherwise it would be well so we're gonna have to look at
[02:40:49.900 --> 02:40:55.340]  that more later but uh i appreciate you joining us talk about the situation in liby i i appreciate
[02:40:55.340 --> 02:41:02.060]  you being on with us will we'll talk to you more in the near future um yeah here's an article right
[02:41:02.060 --> 02:41:08.380]  here holy bailout this is uh this is being reported on by roiders the associated press
[02:41:08.380 --> 02:41:14.220]  this particular article um a printer didn't didn't tell me where it was that i had it in my stack
[02:41:15.020 --> 02:41:21.740]  yesterday and uh yeah this is the daily mail okay that's what i thought they need to set those

[02:41:30.700 --> 02:41:40.780]  of bank of america derivatives trades and it goes on through what's happening just unbelievable so
[02:41:42.140 --> 02:41:47.820]  i love how these banks always lecture us about communism you know i hate communism i hate socialism
[02:41:47.820 --> 02:41:53.500]  but now we have a domesticated population deindustrialized country the banks have stolen tens
[02:41:53.500 --> 02:42:01.020]  of trillions now they want tens of trillions more and they've got the republicans running around and
[02:42:01.020 --> 02:42:07.820]  the democrats running around it it's just unspeakably bad to see all of this happening
[02:42:07.820 --> 02:42:12.300]  william k black who we've interviewed we're gonna get him back on a guy that uh prosecuted a lot
[02:42:12.300 --> 02:42:17.740]  of these people in the past says not with the bank but with a whimper bank of america's derivatives
[02:42:17.740 --> 02:42:22.860]  death rattle i mean this country is getting ready to go belly up and there's no mistake you got all
[02:42:22.860 --> 02:42:28.300]  these new wars they want to start you got the fake killing and bin laden you got the fake killing of
[02:42:28.300 --> 02:42:37.020]  uh amour alalaki all these people now i've got to say that this does fit the mo for somebody
[02:42:37.020 --> 02:42:40.300]  like qaddafi who said he was going to fight to the death but we've got all these conflicting
[02:42:40.300 --> 02:42:46.860]  stories hillary won't say that's confirmed uh could it be a body double i don't know but you
[02:42:46.860 --> 02:42:53.740]  notice they're they're talking about this now while europe goes into a freefall and while cnbc
[02:42:53.740 --> 02:42:59.100]  announces that austerity's here america's over a long steep drop for america's standard of living
[02:42:59.100 --> 02:43:03.020]  he's been on a lot with us lately because so much has been happening and we've only got him
[02:43:03.020 --> 02:43:07.500]  for about seven eight minutes as we go to break here dr steve pacinic uh formerly with the state
[02:43:07.500 --> 02:43:11.980]  department black ops overthrow governments you name it talking about the bin laden thing being
[02:43:11.980 --> 02:43:17.500]  fake before they ever rolled him out uh and when we got contacted this morning he's saying he
[02:43:17.500 --> 02:43:23.340]  smells a rat here so i wanted to give uh his perspective uh doc what's your what's your view
[02:43:23.340 --> 02:43:27.980]  on this whole qaddafi thing right now well right now they've lied once again i mean it's
[02:43:27.980 --> 02:43:33.740]  has been the ozama bin laden lying the lying of the uh mexican cartel and tehran and once again
[02:43:33.740 --> 02:43:39.340]  you have the same mo you have a president who hasn't done anything he wants to run for reelection
[02:43:39.340 --> 02:43:45.820]  he's diverting attention to uh qaddafi and the answer was remember the hundred troops that were
[02:43:45.820 --> 02:43:52.060]  sent down a week ago into chad in niger that's the southern part of libya there they are special
[02:43:52.060 --> 02:43:58.220]  forces has always had to deal with a foreign leader the same way we did with saddam we saying it was
[02:43:58.220 --> 02:44:04.220]  not killed the rule of law and the divine rule of kings still works i've been involved in 20 years
[02:44:04.220 --> 02:44:10.140]  of transitions and takeouts of leaders of world governments and even idiom we didn't take out
[02:44:10.140 --> 02:44:16.380]  this is an absolute unmitigated lie the reason i'm concerned about it is once again some military
[02:44:16.380 --> 02:44:23.260]  our president our secretary's state is lying there's no way that hillary clinton is can go into libya
[02:44:23.260 --> 02:44:28.620]  and denounce that she's going to recognize a transitional government without having had
[02:44:28.620 --> 02:44:34.860]  qaddafi's life saved and we've had belgian special forces counted niger and fighting in
[02:44:34.860 --> 02:44:39.980]  sudan and we have our own special forces who will take him out and put him up in the sahal region
[02:44:39.980 --> 02:44:45.980]  with his family his wife left to aljiri a couple of weeks ago we do not kill foreign
[02:44:45.980 --> 02:44:51.820]  legions i was involved with idiom in yuganda we sent them to sotiravia i have killed a couple
[02:44:51.820 --> 02:44:57.980]  hundred thousand i was involved with noriega we sent them over to spain i was involved in
[02:44:57.980 --> 02:45:05.500]  the canary i mean every leader that we've dealt with we do the rights of keeping we take them out
[02:45:05.500 --> 02:45:10.700]  chuchescu the same people even romsfeld admitted we're going to do to chuchescu just a time of
[02:45:10.700 --> 02:45:16.060]  shame that we did to chuchescu we did not take out chuchescu we burnt the body it's a scyops
[02:45:16.060 --> 02:45:21.580]  technique but more importantly we have this continuous series of lies coming out from all uh
[02:45:21.580 --> 02:45:29.180]  uh uh obama and from hillary clinton and from our intelligence and from newland and once again
[02:45:29.180 --> 02:45:34.700]  this country has to say why are we getting lied to at a moment where we have economic problems
[02:45:34.700 --> 02:45:40.540]  at diversion and the president by the way is now getting reelected and has john biden joseph biden
[02:45:40.540 --> 02:45:46.780]  one of the retards i think of american politics going up there to file for reelection so this is
[02:45:46.780 --> 02:45:52.620]  a diversion once again there's no way the toffee has been killed he's been involved too long with
[02:45:52.620 --> 02:45:57.820]  a cia he's been involved too long with british intelligence with french intelligence with
[02:45:57.820 --> 02:46:04.300]  the sahal region he controls the sub sahal region niger is important where he's got to do the french
[02:46:04.300 --> 02:46:08.780]  you're involved cadets with a french you're involved niger supplies 80 percent of french
[02:46:08.780 --> 02:46:15.420]  nuclear fuels and our special forces were ostensibly sent to to chase down the ukandan warlord
[02:46:15.420 --> 02:46:20.860]  killer now was sent to it to probably take out the doffie and work with him and now what should
[02:46:20.860 --> 02:46:25.260]  have happened is he should have been trialed in front of the icc just like the luxury of it that
[02:46:25.260 --> 02:46:30.940]  this administration once again needs to lie consistently on foreign policy to make this
[02:46:30.940 --> 02:46:36.780]  president look as if he's tough and strong and the lies keep on going and going my concern
[02:46:36.780 --> 02:46:42.620]  is more about the american people and the legitimizing of the office of the presidency
[02:46:42.620 --> 02:46:48.540]  the office of the secretary of defense and state and the credibility of our military
[02:46:48.540 --> 02:46:52.380]  particularly the special operations soldiers because there's a lot of guys who were involved
[02:46:52.380 --> 02:46:57.820]  a lot of guys got killed it is not true that we were not involved we had mercenaries involved we
[02:46:57.820 --> 02:47:02.860]  had french soldiers involved we had belgium soldiers involved in british there's no way
[02:47:02.860 --> 02:47:07.740]  they killed low market doffie that's not our operating mode and i've been involved in 30 years
[02:47:07.740 --> 02:47:13.500]  worth of takeouts and change regimes so i could assure you i'll put up a million dollars if there's
[02:47:13.500 --> 02:47:19.100]  no way if and that's there no way that they killed the doffie they will place him in some
[02:47:19.100 --> 02:47:24.300]  isolation ports somewhere in the saha region and our special forces are involved with this and once
[02:47:24.300 --> 02:47:29.180]  again the president lied at which point he's going to stop lying i have no idea if the american
[02:47:29.180 --> 02:47:35.020]  public has to demand transparency and truth particularly after the nonsense with mexico
[02:47:35.020 --> 02:47:39.900]  and tehran where they started to try to start a war the nonsense of osama so you think this is
[02:47:39.900 --> 02:47:44.140]  another you think this is a well i mean they've got a london guardian now is saying what they
[02:47:44.780 --> 02:47:50.700]  they're putting out official photos will show those on screen it's the headlines warning contains
[02:47:50.700 --> 02:47:58.300]  graphic images and video we can distort anything alex we do that professionally all the time we
[02:47:58.300 --> 02:48:03.260]  did it with osama ben laden when you had all those tapes that was all docked we did it with
[02:48:03.260 --> 02:48:08.620]  asadam who's sitting in his kids i mean those are flat photos that can be docked there's no way
[02:48:08.620 --> 02:48:14.940]  am i six british intelligence sas are going to take out a leader when in fact a leader had an
[02:48:14.940 --> 02:48:19.660]  economic investments with these people there was no way we're going to take him out and kill him
[02:48:19.660 --> 02:48:24.380]  because he should have been brought to trial it's awkward they can't bring him to trial because he
[02:48:24.380 --> 02:48:29.820]  can indict a lot of the world leaders including golden sacks who you remember had a million six
[02:48:29.820 --> 02:48:35.420]  a billion six trade and screwed it up and asked the dot feed to take an equity position in
[02:48:35.420 --> 02:48:40.940]  gulman sacks so this is more of an embarrassment to our intelligence to the british intelligence
[02:48:40.940 --> 02:48:45.100]  if they keep on insisting they can call me conspiracy but there's a problem i've been
[02:48:45.100 --> 02:48:52.380]  lecturing on on scyops regime change for 20 years before mcnair i've been teaching this to end down
[02:48:52.380 --> 02:48:57.820]  deception denial i've been involved in more regime change than anyone individual in this
[02:48:57.820 --> 02:49:03.500]  administration for sure i know the individuals involved and i can assure you they are lying
[02:49:03.500 --> 02:49:09.260]  let me ask you this question let me ask you this question we just showed videos and photos
[02:49:09.260 --> 02:49:14.380]  now that reportedly they got him torturing shot him in the legs and then shot him in the head
[02:49:16.220 --> 02:49:20.940]  i mean if this is a scyop they've actually produced more we know they've created fake
[02:49:20.940 --> 02:49:25.340]  bin Laden videos before and then said they threw him in the ocean we don't do that to world leaders
[02:49:25.340 --> 02:49:30.060]  you yourself you're the one who gave me the tip off months ago when you said the divine
[02:49:30.060 --> 02:49:34.620]  right of kings you have to explain that to the audience that since the beginning of time from
[02:49:34.620 --> 02:49:40.380]  the biblical times to the new testament through the medieval ages up to british law including
[02:49:40.380 --> 02:49:47.100]  american law we did not we do not take out foreign leaders we claim we take them we create pictures
[02:49:47.100 --> 02:49:53.580]  of it in order to give a certain end of the story i have no love for Gaddafi i was involved
[02:49:53.580 --> 02:49:58.460]  in the original raid under Reagan so i have a pretty good now it's like putting a napoleon on
[02:49:58.460 --> 02:50:04.220]  alba i mean i mean because other elites don't ever like to see kings have their heads cut off
[02:50:04.220 --> 02:50:09.900]  they like to basically keep themselves above the fray i mean there's no doubt that bin laden's
[02:50:09.900 --> 02:50:14.380]  fake you're just saying knowing the players involved maybe they grabbed a body double and
[02:50:14.380 --> 02:50:20.620]  killed him i mean who knows no no this is this is total distortion lying it's consistent think about
[02:50:20.620 --> 02:50:25.100]  it for a minute alex and your audience get very smart and this is why you're so important
[02:50:25.100 --> 02:50:31.660]  bin laden was faked i predict that we talked about the fact that the war this nonsense story that
[02:50:31.660 --> 02:50:38.620]  came out of mexico involving uh kairan even euler was a came to say that this was but so we knew
[02:50:38.620 --> 02:50:44.460]  that was fake that stopped israel stopped they dealt with Hamas and now i'm telling you this is
[02:50:44.460 --> 02:50:51.020]  fake because they don't want to bring um omar qaddafi to trial his family was already uh taken
[02:50:51.020 --> 02:50:55.900]  out about a month or two months ago to alcheria but what's interesting is it's not an accident

[02:54:15.900 --> 02:54:21.180]  all got to give our rights up because al-qaeda is going to get us now but al-qaeda is the good guys
[02:54:21.180 --> 02:54:26.380]  tsa checkpoints all over the country dragging families out of their cars they tried it with us
[02:54:26.380 --> 02:54:32.780]  last night that video premiere this evening it's pretty powerful i get in their face big time
[02:54:32.780 --> 02:54:37.020]  at prism planet dot tv seven o'clock what did i ever do to you that we're going back to pacenic
[02:54:37.020 --> 02:54:42.700]  here to finish up what qaddafi said is he begged for his life libyan prime minister confirms that
[02:54:42.700 --> 02:54:50.380]  former dictator is dead wounded weakened covered in blood and dirt the fallen dictator was dragged
[02:54:50.380 --> 02:54:56.540]  from a truck to meet his unceremonious hand first he said it was a gutter or a spider hole in front
[02:54:56.540 --> 02:55:01.740]  of a brain mob mua mar qaddafi the former libyan leader begged the revolutionary soldiers for his
[02:55:01.740 --> 02:55:07.660]  life like a musolini end becoming increasingly desperate he asked one rebel leader what did i
[02:55:07.660 --> 02:55:13.020]  ever do to you but his pleas fell on deaf ears the deposed despot was mercilessly shot to death
[02:55:13.020 --> 02:55:20.540]  he spit blood heralding the end of a terrible 42 year epoch in libyan history uh doc we only
[02:55:20.540 --> 02:55:25.900]  have about three four minutes left uh they're lying what this is a classical denigration of
[02:55:25.900 --> 02:55:30.540]  the world leader in order to make sure that he came out with being humiliated in that the will
[02:55:30.540 --> 02:55:36.780]  of the forces transitional forces had won i'm not questioning the fact that qaddafi as regime should
[02:55:36.780 --> 02:55:41.260]  have been ended but not questioning the fact that this president repeatedly has to lie in front
[02:55:41.260 --> 02:55:47.020]  of the american public sodas are cia the cia was involved in this special ops was involved
[02:55:47.020 --> 02:55:52.860]  is not an accident you have special ops going into cad and central advocates from five days ago
[02:55:52.860 --> 02:55:58.060]  and you have to show biden asking for a reelection of the president to show how powerful he is when
[02:55:58.060 --> 02:56:03.420]  he can't do anything domestically and then you have the pathological liar illy clinton going to
[02:56:03.420 --> 02:56:08.620]  libya there's no way that woman who's basically very scared and very ineffectual would go to libyan
[02:56:08.620 --> 02:56:13.260]  recognize transitional committees so we have once again an obsession and this administration
[02:56:13.260 --> 02:56:19.820]  is lying and i what i care about is the delegitimizing of the volatility of this institution of america
[02:56:19.820 --> 02:56:25.340]  which he doesn't belong to and our soldiers and our intelligence and our national security apparatus
[02:56:25.340 --> 02:56:31.340]  we've got to change that and that's a doc something that makes me think you could be right uh is
[02:56:31.340 --> 02:56:37.100]  they've released a new fake video of hillary learning and getting excited just like the fake
[02:56:37.100 --> 02:56:42.460]  situation situation room and they do say she's going to libya she's the one that's been caught
[02:56:43.260 --> 02:56:49.500]  lying in iraq and syria claiming she flies into war zones that are under fire and it turns out
[02:56:49.500 --> 02:56:54.860]  it's all lies so i mean these are confirmed liars why believe anything well no no they
[02:56:54.860 --> 02:56:59.660]  confirmed lies i'll tell you when we were involved in bossy over one judge he was the one who held
[02:56:59.660 --> 02:57:05.660]  back her husband who's another pathological liar clinton who allowed 800 000 or one is to die even
[02:57:05.660 --> 02:57:10.060]  though they were going to be uh killed before and he was warned about it and she was worried
[02:57:10.060 --> 02:57:16.060]  about his political career this is a pathological liar who's married a pathological liar who works
[02:57:16.060 --> 02:57:21.900]  for pathological liar i don't care if they get rid of all of them but what we need is a reaffirmation
[02:57:21.900 --> 02:57:27.740]  of the american government that has legitimacy transparency and the fact that people can no
[02:57:27.740 --> 02:57:33.340]  longer be lied to you because we have no jobs we have a dysfunctional government and we have to
[02:57:33.340 --> 02:57:38.380]  change it none of the legislators have said anything so you see they're all cowards the
[02:57:38.380 --> 02:57:43.260]  democrats and republicans i have no love for patafi but i can tell you he's a very smart guy you
[02:57:43.260 --> 02:57:49.260]  don't stay power 53 years and you don't suddenly get killed and humiliated and he was taken out
[02:57:49.260 --> 02:57:54.620]  quietly by our special forces that were sent out a week ago which is what the reason they were sent
[02:57:54.620 --> 02:58:00.620]  there was for the lord resistance army in yuganda i worked in yuganda i took out edm me and we sent
[02:58:00.620 --> 02:58:06.620]  him to uh to study arabia he ended up and he killed over 100 000 people so there's no way our
[02:58:06.620 --> 02:58:11.740]  special forces was not involved i'm ashamed of patreus i'm ashamed again of the intelligence
[02:58:11.740 --> 02:58:17.340]  community and the military and i'm afraid that our special forces are being used as cannon fodder
[02:58:17.340 --> 02:58:22.620]  as is our military and our intelligence we have to go and protest this again and only you
[02:58:22.620 --> 02:58:28.060]  and only you alex came forth years ago with the notion that we don't kill uh and the divine
[02:58:28.060 --> 02:58:34.460]  rights of king and this president is just an obsessional obsessional pathological lot
[02:58:34.460 --> 02:58:38.460]  doc we're out of time lord willow we'll be back tomorrow we'll be back tonight seven o'clock
