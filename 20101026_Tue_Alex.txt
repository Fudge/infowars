[00:00.000 --> 00:11.560]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.560 --> 00:19.140]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.140 --> 00:23.100]  Texas Alex Jones
[00:23.100 --> 00:31.220]  Tuesday October 26 2010 it's the Alex Jones show live and I'm your host Paul
[00:31.220 --> 00:37.220]  Joseph Watson editor and writer for prisonplanet.com Alex is flying back
[00:37.220 --> 00:42.380]  from California today so I'll be your filling host for the first hour in the
[00:42.380 --> 00:46.220]  second two hours that we're gonna replay some of the best interviews from the
[00:46.220 --> 00:51.060]  Alex Jones show over the past couple of weeks and we're gonna be taking your
[00:51.060 --> 00:56.580]  calls in the next segment if you want to load up the board the number is 800 259
[00:56.580 --> 01:04.820]  92 31 that's 800 259 92 31 and we're gonna talk about whatever you like but of
[01:04.820 --> 01:09.460]  course we're on the eve of the mid-term elections and there's already evidence
[01:09.460 --> 01:15.940]  of not only debate fraud people cheating during political debates but also now
[01:15.940 --> 01:23.140]  vote fraud that's right have Fox News 5 reporting voters suspicious of fraud at
[01:23.140 --> 01:27.740]  ballot box some voters in Boulder City said they are concerned about fraud at
[01:27.740 --> 01:32.780]  the electronic ballot box voter Joyce Ferrara said that when they went to vote
[01:32.780 --> 01:37.420]  for Republican Sharon Angle her Democratic opponent Senator Harry Reid's
[01:37.420 --> 01:42.940]  name was already checked oh really and here's another vote voter problems
[01:42.940 --> 01:48.620]  voter reports problem with ballot machine New Bern's son journal Sam
[01:48.620 --> 01:52.860]  Laughing House of New Bern said he pushed the button to vote Republican in all
[01:52.860 --> 01:58.180]  races but the voting machine screen displayed a ballot with all Democrats
[01:58.180 --> 02:03.620]  checked oh he cleared the screen tried again and then the article goes on to
[02:03.620 --> 02:09.340]  explain how it took him five separate attempts until he was allowed to vote for
[02:09.340 --> 02:14.660]  who he wanted so it seems the establishment is looking at playing
[02:14.660 --> 02:20.100]  its ace in the hole and resorting to this vote fraud of course we've had
[02:20.100 --> 02:25.740]  months and months of endless contrived smears against Sharon Angle and Rand
[02:25.740 --> 02:31.940]  Paul none of which have had any effect whatsoever and in fact the polls show
[02:31.940 --> 02:36.820]  have helped the chances of both candidates so now we're going to see
[02:36.820 --> 02:43.500]  dirtier and dirtier tricks from this discredited and desperate establishment
[02:43.500 --> 02:49.820]  and lo and behold that's right it's a new month so that must mean a new Rand Paul
[02:49.820 --> 02:57.060]  smear and the latest is a Rand Paul supporter video shows stomped on a
[02:57.060 --> 03:03.540]  George Soros activist Autobot representative of the move on foundation
[03:03.540 --> 03:08.660]  during Rand Paul's debate with his Democratic opponent Jack Conway yesterday
[03:08.660 --> 03:13.820]  so I guess now that just means that Rand Paul likes to go around stomping on
[03:13.820 --> 03:19.180]  liberals who disagree with him that's the cry from the liberal blogs and forums
[03:19.180 --> 03:23.900]  at the moment so we go to this clip now play the clip a member of move on dot
[03:23.900 --> 03:28.740]  org pushed her way through a crowd of Rand Paul supporters with a sign police
[03:28.740 --> 03:33.540]  say she wanted to get her sign close to the candidate as he entered KET studios
[03:33.540 --> 03:38.980]  so a picture could be taken and posted on the website in this video it appears
[03:38.980 --> 03:43.140]  someone grabbed her wig and she tripped and fell that's what a man wearing a
[03:43.140 --> 03:47.780]  Rand Paul t-shirt stepped on her she refused treatment from emergency
[03:47.780 --> 03:52.700]  workers police trying to identify the man in that video and are trying to
[03:52.700 --> 03:56.860]  determine if he stepped on her intentionally she has filed an assault
[03:56.860 --> 04:01.540]  report so far because they have not identified the man police have made no
[04:01.540 --> 04:07.980]  arrest and there was a day so that's right now according to all the leftist
[04:07.980 --> 04:13.980]  blogs anyone who supports the Tea Party is also now a brown shirt that's right
[04:13.980 --> 04:18.660]  you know these establishment funded liberals bang on all day about the
[04:18.660 --> 04:24.220]  disgrace of anyone other than them invoking Nazis and Hitler in the course
[04:24.220 --> 04:29.980]  of a political debate and then there's one incident like this and the Nazi
[04:29.980 --> 04:34.780]  rhetoric comes out in full force but I mean you know look out the window I
[04:34.780 --> 04:39.580]  don't see tea party activists burning down synagogues or you know abducting
[04:39.580 --> 04:44.820]  liberals from their houses as they sleep which is what the brown shirts did now
[04:44.820 --> 04:49.780]  this guy who stomps on the girl in the video is obviously a complete moron and
[04:49.780 --> 04:55.820]  he needs to be charged with assault but did we see leftists up in arms when
[04:55.820 --> 05:00.820]  people like Kenneth Gladney was attacked and called the n-word for handing out
[05:00.820 --> 05:07.860]  you're out on the road the last place you want to be is on the road but if the
[05:07.860 --> 05:12.900]  unfortunate happens you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets there's a

[06:03.580 --> 06:07.580]  generator number one new climate legislation could easily double or
[06:07.580 --> 06:11.820]  triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control how
[06:11.820 --> 06:16.100]  much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government
[06:16.100 --> 06:20.460]  control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number
[06:20.460 --> 06:24.540]  three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and
[06:24.540 --> 06:29.100]  now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[06:29.100 --> 06:33.220]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[06:33.220 --> 06:37.180]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power
[06:37.180 --> 06:41.020]  generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I
[06:41.020 --> 06:43.740]  really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from
[06:43.740 --> 06:49.740]  science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com

[08:07.020 --> 08:13.380]  continues it's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[08:13.380 --> 08:20.500]  Paul Joseph Watson filling in for Alex Jones on this Tuesday October 26th now
[08:20.500 --> 08:24.020]  we've got so much to talk about we're basically running over the brakes I'd
[08:24.020 --> 08:31.900]  like to hear what you want to discuss on the program today at 800-259-9231 and
[08:31.900 --> 08:37.660]  we played the clip just before the break there of this move on operative who was
[08:37.660 --> 08:43.180]  attempting to have a confrontation with Rand Paul she was stopped by Rand Paul
[08:43.180 --> 08:47.540]  supporters and one of them later appeared to were stomp on her head or at
[08:47.540 --> 08:53.300]  least on her neck now as we were saying obviously this guy needs to be hit with
[08:53.300 --> 08:58.100]  assault charges immediately but what's interesting about the reaction from the
[08:58.100 --> 09:03.140]  leftist blogosphere is the fact that they're now trotting out this all tea
[09:03.140 --> 09:08.420]  party supporters or brown shirt you know angry right wingers who want to engage
[09:08.420 --> 09:14.860]  in violence and yet almost every example that we've documented thus far shows
[09:14.860 --> 09:19.900]  that it's the leftist in fact that are the most violent and unwieldy people
[09:19.900 --> 09:26.380]  engaging in extremist activities in the course of this mid-term election for
[09:26.380 --> 09:31.320]  example Kenneth Gladney this was the guy who wasn't even a member of the tea
[09:31.320 --> 09:35.340]  party at the time who was handing out don't tread on me flags a political
[09:35.340 --> 09:40.940]  function he was called the n-word by these union thug operatives these
[09:40.940 --> 09:46.220]  Obama supporters and he was beat up didn't see them you know spewing brown
[09:46.220 --> 09:50.420]  shirt rhetoric than that happened didn't see them spewing that rhetoric when an
[09:50.420 --> 09:57.340]  Obama supporter down in North Carolina punched a conservative full in the face
[09:57.340 --> 10:02.660]  for simply speaking out against our dear leader and the bailout and of course
[10:02.660 --> 10:07.860]  you remember it was last November when answer hired thugs viciously attacked
[10:07.860 --> 10:13.380]  Dave Colquitt of Floridans for immigration enforcement again leftist
[10:13.380 --> 10:20.180]  thugs engaging in brutal violence in pursuit of their political agenda but
[10:20.180 --> 10:23.860]  there were no cries of brown shirts from the liberals who are saying that today
[10:23.860 --> 10:29.060]  in response to this Rand Paul incident and in fact this is the very first
[10:29.060 --> 10:34.340]  example I can recall of tea party supporters ever engaging in any violence
[10:34.340 --> 10:40.060]  whatsoever I mean the Obamanoids are on the rampage every week punching people
[10:40.060 --> 10:45.180]  in the face beating them up with their signs and yet you don't hear the George
[10:45.180 --> 10:50.660]  Soros funded mouthpieces like media matters and think progress complaining
[10:50.660 --> 10:55.220]  about a black man being called the n-word and then beaten up unless it's
[10:55.220 --> 11:00.140]  carried out by tea party activists which of course hasn't happened but when the
[11:00.140 --> 11:06.340]  loving liberals do it the silence is deafening and that's because you know you
[11:06.340 --> 11:12.100]  can't sell a fear mongering campaign about the rise of the angry right as MSNBC
[11:12.100 --> 11:18.540]  labeled it and how critics of Obama are racist extremists intent on violence
[11:18.540 --> 11:23.300]  when the only racist extremists actually carrying out the violence are all
[11:23.300 --> 11:29.060]  leftist Obama supporters but you know I guess we should at least be thankful for
[11:29.060 --> 11:34.300]  the fact that think progress which is one of these media organizations pushing
[11:34.300 --> 11:39.660]  this story today admits to quote driving the White House as message and
[11:39.660 --> 11:45.540]  agenda that's right their own director Jennifer Palmiere admitted that this is
[11:45.540 --> 11:51.500]  a group that claims on its own website that it's non-partisan is bankrolled by
[11:51.500 --> 11:57.500]  a think tank headed up by John Podesta head of Barack Obama's presidential
[11:57.500 --> 12:02.620]  transition team and it's committed to quote driving the White House message
[12:02.620 --> 12:08.100]  and agenda how very non-partisan it's like saying that you know Carl Rose
[12:08.100 --> 12:14.820]  non-partisan to Republicans on the other hand media matters which is the kind
[12:14.820 --> 12:18.820]  of a sister organization that they all sit on the same boards they're behind
[12:18.820 --> 12:24.860]  the same activist projects as think progress media matters is still trying
[12:24.860 --> 12:29.020]  to cling to the conviction that they're not another front for George Soros and
[12:29.020 --> 12:34.220]  the Obama administration last week Alex was talking about how somebody from
[12:34.220 --> 12:39.140]  media matters who was interviewing him point blank denied the fact that the
[12:39.140 --> 12:44.940]  organization took any funds from George Soros and then just days later it made
[12:44.940 --> 12:50.660]  worldwide headlines that Soros had donated a million dollars to media matters
[12:50.660 --> 12:55.980]  and of course you know they're joined at the hip with think progress they run a
[12:55.980 --> 13:01.140]  you know educational outreach called progressive media which is again headed
[13:01.140 --> 13:07.860]  by John Podesta this Obama administration transition chief so these
[13:07.860 --> 13:11.900]  White House front groups like media matters and think progress who are
[13:11.900 --> 13:16.780]  aggressively pushing these smears against Rand Paul Sharon angle and other
[13:16.780 --> 13:22.380]  tea party members receive millions in donations from these billionaires like
[13:22.380 --> 13:26.500]  Soros and other wealthy elites people linked to Hillary Clinton people like
[13:26.500 --> 13:32.420]  that and all the money is going towards number one attacking of course Glenn
[13:32.420 --> 13:37.020]  Beck but now several times a week every time we look on the media matters
[13:37.020 --> 13:41.940]  website they're attacking Alex Jones he's become the number two target behind
[13:41.940 --> 13:48.100]  only Glenn Beck and if media matters are not attacking Alex then think progress
[13:48.100 --> 13:55.500]  is and of course driving home the White House as message and agenda is all
[13:55.500 --> 14:00.100]  part of the relentless smear campaign against against not only Rand Paul but
[14:00.100 --> 14:07.220]  also Sharon angle because both have a very real chance of defeating the
[14:07.220 --> 14:12.940]  incumbent politicians in the upcoming midterm elections so now we have we've
[14:12.940 --> 14:18.060]  got liberals everywhere flogging this new non-story Rand Paul supporters are
[14:18.060 --> 14:24.020]  all now brown shirts who want to beat up their political adversaries I mean we've
[14:24.020 --> 14:29.420]  got a running joke here in editing and posting stories to prisonplanet.com
[14:29.420 --> 14:34.140]  every day every day we get up in the morning do a Google news search to find
[14:34.140 --> 14:40.620]  out what Rand Paul has not done today what he has not done and what was it the
[14:40.620 --> 14:45.060]  other day Rand Paul didn't Rand Paul didn't put his name to newsletters that
[14:45.060 --> 14:50.620]  said quote monkeys gave birth to black babies that's right Rolling Stone
[14:50.620 --> 14:55.620]  magazine just casually throw it out there that Rand Paul was involved in these
[14:55.620 --> 15:00.220]  newsletters of course his name's not on any of them there's no connection
[15:00.220 --> 15:04.420]  whatsoever but you know what the hell would just throw it out there anyway
[15:04.420 --> 15:10.940]  just like you know Rand Paul kidnapped women against their will drugs them and
[15:10.940 --> 15:18.540]  forces them to worship false gods oh yes the disgraceful aqua Buddha scandal
[15:18.540 --> 15:25.420]  the serious grave aqua Buddha scandal the 30-year-old college prank in which the
[15:25.420 --> 15:30.740]  woman who was involved almost immediately after the story broke retracted
[15:30.740 --> 15:36.020]  said the whole thing was quote no big deal but the Washington Post still to
[15:36.020 --> 15:44.260]  this day maintains that Rand Paul's involvement in this 30-year-old hazing
[15:44.260 --> 15:49.300]  trick which was about a hundred times milder than anything George W. Bosch or
[15:49.300 --> 15:55.780]  John Kerry engaged in with their skull and bones initiation that it has a you
[15:55.780 --> 16:01.460]  know a major bearing on a senatorial campaign 30 years later and they're
[16:01.460 --> 16:08.500]  still obsessing about it to this day the dreaded aqua Buddha meanwhile ignoring
[16:08.500 --> 16:14.780]  the fact that the people funding Jack Conway's campaign Paul's opponent also
[16:14.780 --> 16:19.460]  tipped off his brother Conway's brother to the fact that he was being investigated
[16:19.460 --> 16:24.700]  for drug trafficking we got that story posted on prisonplanet.com today so
[16:24.700 --> 16:30.100]  where's where's media matters or think progress on that one imagine if Rand
[16:30.100 --> 16:37.120]  Paul's campaign had been funded by people allegedly engaged in conspiracy to
[16:37.120 --> 16:42.220]  pervert the course of justice you know in a drug trafficking investigation but
[16:42.220 --> 16:49.700]  no it's all about the aqua Buddha the aqua Buddha rain supreme how can that be
[16:49.700 --> 16:56.580]  a bigger controversy than criminal money allegedly funding Conway's campaign
[16:56.580 --> 17:03.460]  imagine if that had come out about Rand Paul but again it's all about the
[17:03.460 --> 17:07.660]  aqua Buddha it has been for the past couple of months and it still is I want
[17:07.660 --> 17:12.300]  to hear what you think about this new smear against Rand Paul we're gonna go
[17:12.300 --> 17:16.460]  to your calls and the first caller is Christopher in Alabama Christopher go
[17:16.460 --> 17:21.420]  ahead how are you doing today great Christopher what's on your mind today
[17:21.420 --> 17:26.340]  well I want to use you to hopefully get to Alex Jones or his producer I've been
[17:26.340 --> 17:30.620]  trying to get in touch with Alex now for almost two years it really bothered me
[17:30.620 --> 17:33.740]  with that I heard on on his show on Thursday that he had the guy on I
[17:33.740 --> 17:40.260]  didn't talk to the guy that had terminal cancer you know I'm talking about was
[17:40.260 --> 17:44.140]  this the guest that was on Alex's show are you talking about Lindsay Williams's
[17:44.140 --> 17:51.020]  source yeah it's also has terminal cancer we could really easily save his
[17:51.020 --> 17:56.220]  life if you guys are interested and I want to talk to you all fair to give
[17:56.220 --> 18:00.620]  you some really interesting information I have twins that have a very rare
[18:00.620 --> 18:03.860]  disease called PKU with a never eat protein the rest of life no milk no
[18:03.860 --> 18:06.660]  chicken or cheese no fish no birthday cake no ice cream nothing that's
[18:06.660 --> 18:11.820]  protein if they take it in it becomes very toxic goes to the brain and eats
[18:11.820 --> 18:15.780]  up the brain and causes extreme mental retardation because of my twins I
[18:15.780 --> 18:20.300]  decide to go out and try to find a cure for can't a cure for their PKU in the
[18:20.300 --> 18:24.020]  process of doing it we found many different cures for everything on the
[18:24.020 --> 18:28.020]  planet rediscovered and they've been there forever it's just our government
[18:28.020 --> 18:34.460]  has covered them up and it is beyond sad and in the process of studying PKU my
[18:34.460 --> 18:38.540]  children's levels continue to go up and we couldn't figure out why and being
[18:38.540 --> 18:41.020]  that I was in the gym business and own quite a few health clubs I thought I
[18:41.020 --> 18:44.420]  knew a lot about nutrition and then I was forced to study nutrition and things
[18:44.420 --> 18:49.700]  I found out with what would beyond frustrate you to start with aspartame
[18:49.700 --> 18:53.940]  because of my children on the back of every diet product on in the country it
[18:53.940 --> 18:58.380]  says that's a kid to know it contains the only okay through my children if they
[18:58.380 --> 19:03.180]  drink that diet drink it will eat up their brain instantaneously okay it does
[19:03.180 --> 19:06.380]  the same thing for all your listeners that drink diet drink it just takes a
[19:06.380 --> 19:10.100]  much slower process and it's one of those soft-kill weapons that they use
[19:10.100 --> 19:15.300]  against us and it's beyond sad but we have technology that we've had over
[19:15.300 --> 19:20.700]  30,000 terminal cancer patients hepatitis lime TV that we put the FDA
[19:20.700 --> 19:25.180]  says that aspartame's good for us I mean all the studies that say it's good for
[19:25.180 --> 19:30.140]  us are funded by the same organizations putting aspartame in the food can't we

[24:00.180 --> 24:24.100]  it's the Alex Jones show live I'm your host for today Paul Joseph Watson going
[24:24.100 --> 24:29.460]  to move your calls shortly I was talking before the break about media matters
[24:29.460 --> 24:35.420]  this organization that's tied at the hip with the John Podesta Obama White House
[24:35.420 --> 24:40.660]  controlled think progress this organization media matters that just
[24:40.660 --> 24:46.220]  received a million dollars from billionaire globalist George Soros I
[24:46.220 --> 24:50.660]  said that their number one target was Glenn Beck with Alex Jones number two
[24:50.660 --> 24:55.380]  maybe I have to revise that position because their top story on their website
[24:55.380 --> 25:00.980]  today Beck and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones are two of a kind and in this
[25:00.980 --> 25:07.500]  article they attempt to use the claims that Alex has made to discredit Glenn
[25:07.500 --> 25:13.860]  Beck basically by saying that they're espousing the same incorrect rhetoric and
[25:13.860 --> 25:19.140]  one of the things they say is quote Beck and Jones repeat same falsehoods
[25:19.140 --> 25:24.140]  about Holdren and this of course relates to John P. Holdren the White House
[25:24.140 --> 25:30.580]  science are and it says John it says the Alex Jones claims Holdren says forced
[25:30.580 --> 25:35.820]  abortions and mass sterilizations are needed to save the planet and media
[25:35.820 --> 25:41.820]  matters reprints this as if just just by printing it that it immediately
[25:41.820 --> 25:48.940]  discredits it we've got John Holdren's 1977 textbook eco science we've got the
[25:48.940 --> 25:55.180]  screenshots from the textbook where he openly advocates forced abortions mass
[25:55.180 --> 26:02.460]  sterilization programs even devices mandatory implants implanted in women
[26:02.460 --> 26:06.580]  to prevent them from becoming pregnant until they receive government
[26:06.580 --> 26:11.980]  permission that's not our words that's in his own book and they they don't even
[26:11.980 --> 26:17.820]  try to disprove it don't even have an argument and that it just goes through
[26:17.820 --> 26:23.980]  a litany of examples Cass Sunstein it denies the fact that Cass Sunstein called
[26:23.980 --> 26:28.500]  for infiltrating conspiracy websites which is exactly what he called for in
[26:28.500 --> 26:35.380]  his own 2008 white paper perhaps media matters and they don't put a name on
[26:35.380 --> 26:39.620]  this article there's some coward and some anonymous coward hiding behind it
[26:39.620 --> 26:43.980]  because they don't have any information to back up their claims but maybe the
[26:43.980 --> 26:49.740]  coward that wrote this article should have read the 50 odd page Holdren
[26:49.740 --> 26:54.020]  white paper as I did in which he explicitly states that the government
[26:54.020 --> 26:58.820]  needs to infiltrate conspiracy theorist websites I mean get it straight you
[26:58.820 --> 27:03.420]  don't have any credibility when you're tied at the hip with George Soros and the
[27:03.420 --> 27:10.860]  White House you're not non-partisan I mean this is the group that's engaged in
[27:10.860 --> 27:16.460]  the educational outreach program progressive media with think progress
[27:16.460 --> 27:23.420]  that's headed up by John Podesta who worked directly for Obama was the head
[27:23.420 --> 27:29.740]  of his presidential transition team these smears not only on Rand Paul and
[27:29.740 --> 27:34.540]  Sharon angle as we've seen today but also on our very own Alex Jones are
[27:34.540 --> 27:38.820]  coming through these media organizations that are nothing more than
[27:38.820 --> 27:43.980]  propaganda fronts for the Obama administration as we've proven that and
[27:43.980 --> 27:48.660]  I'm basically going to document this all in an article that will come out either
[27:48.660 --> 27:52.300]  later today or tomorrow but what do you think about this we're going to go to
[27:52.300 --> 27:57.060]  another caller Jonathan in Kansas Jonathan go ahead
[27:58.180 --> 28:06.500]  Jonathan you're on the air no we lost Julio in Illinois you go ahead Julio
[28:06.500 --> 28:11.900]  Paul Joseph it's always great to talk to fellow freedom fighter from across the
[28:11.900 --> 28:16.100]  pond everyone who listened to the Lindsay Williams interview please go to
[28:16.100 --> 28:23.100]  your Bibles and read 2nd Corinthians chapter 7 13 and 14 and you know if we
[28:23.100 --> 28:28.380]  all pray for repentance throughout the world freedom will survive Paul my
[28:28.380 --> 28:32.300]  question about the Mockingbird media I've been asking Alex about this and I
[28:32.300 --> 28:36.060]  think you you write unbelievable articles if we could do something if we
[28:36.060 --> 28:41.700]  can get like a mass collection of videos clips articles of the Mockingbird
[28:41.700 --> 28:47.900]  media and get a Google search term put it to number one I mean I'm at media
[28:47.900 --> 28:52.780]  matters right now and I mean they talked about Beck and Jones embrace a new
[28:52.780 --> 28:57.860]  world order and they promote the invisible and
[28:58.740 --> 29:04.620]  dumb hello Paul yeah go ahead okay sorry I thought I lost you there for a second
[29:04.620 --> 29:09.500]  I mean if people on media matters go to invisible Empire the movie they will
[29:09.500 --> 29:12.820]  obviously see that media matters is nothing but a joke and they will hear
[29:12.820 --> 29:17.900]  George Bush speaking to the Army at a ceremony about a new world order on
[29:17.900 --> 29:24.500]  September 11th 91 the Mockingbird media really discussed me and me being a
[29:24.500 --> 29:30.660]  broadcasting major at my university looking at third-party organizations
[29:30.660 --> 29:34.860]  they're they're allowed by law to do this so if we could expose Rupert Murdoch
[29:34.860 --> 29:38.660]  being in favor of amnesty in a North American Union in America though he's
[29:38.660 --> 29:41.740]  Australian who's the right for him to tell us this and secondly Paul quickly
[29:41.740 --> 29:46.100]  it's okay stay there we'll be back after the break
[29:46.100 --> 29:59.100]  we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[30:01.100 --> 30:05.860]  hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone this
[30:05.860 --> 30:11.380]  is our last chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this agenda that
[30:11.380 --> 30:15.100]  we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home I've turned members
[30:15.100 --> 30:20.140]  influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the shots I
[30:20.140 --> 30:25.540]  think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention full
[30:25.540 --> 30:30.460]  of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel
[30:30.460 --> 30:34.820]  held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world
[30:34.820 --> 30:38.580]  government Tim Geithner Bernanke their arsonists they're asking for more
[30:38.580 --> 30:42.540]  matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the checkout to today seems
[30:42.540 --> 30:48.180]  like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the

[31:09.220 --> 31:13.460]  agree perhaps a recession ended for the bankers and government employees but for

[33:16.420 --> 33:21.340]  media matters these white house propaganda fronts media matters again
[33:21.340 --> 33:26.420]  today engaged in a smear against alex jones this happens now and on almost
[33:26.420 --> 33:31.980]  daily basis now there's a there's a segment in their article called beckon
[33:31.980 --> 33:38.140]  jones fear monger over global governance and it says jones Copenhagen climate
[33:38.140 --> 33:42.500]  summit designed to create global government using carbon taxes in a
[33:42.500 --> 33:47.260]  video posted to youtube jones claimed that the climate conference in Copenhagen
[33:47.260 --> 33:51.420]  had as part of its agenda a plan to create global government and global
[33:51.420 --> 33:57.300]  governance using carbon taxes and media matters reprints this as if it's some
[33:57.300 --> 34:04.620]  kind of conspiracy theory I mean the UN secretary general banky moon wrote in a
[34:04.620 --> 34:10.380]  los angeles times it was actually an interview with the los angeles times this
[34:10.380 --> 34:15.180]  was shortly before the Copenhagen climate conference quote we will establish a
[34:15.180 --> 34:20.940]  global governance structure to monitor and manage the implementation of this so
[34:20.940 --> 34:25.740]  that's the UN secretary general saying it it's not alex jones saying it it's
[34:25.740 --> 34:30.780]  not Glenn Beck and yet they reprint this as if it's a claim as if it's a
[34:30.780 --> 34:35.660]  conspiracy theory that Copenhagen was about trying to get a carbon tax through
[34:35.660 --> 34:41.100]  and the UN secretary general said it in an interview with the LA times a few
[34:41.100 --> 34:46.980]  days before the conference I mean they say that the fight that alex talks about
[34:46.980 --> 34:51.260]  a new world order creating a network of international laws to regulate and
[34:51.260 --> 34:56.340]  control and dominate nations is another conspiracy theory oh really we've only
[34:56.340 --> 35:01.620]  got hundreds of elitists and power brokers saying that exact thing almost
[35:01.620 --> 35:07.420]  every single day we've got a clip here of the EU Commission president van
[35:07.420 --> 35:13.860]  rompe when he was sworn in saying that very thing play the clip 2009 is also
[35:13.860 --> 35:18.260]  the first year of global governance with the establishment of the G20 in the
[35:18.260 --> 35:23.580]  middle of the financial crisis the climate conference in Copenhagen is
[35:23.580 --> 35:29.220]  another step towards the global management of our planet
[35:29.220 --> 35:34.900]  I'm the global management of our planet but you know creating a network of
[35:34.900 --> 35:39.500]  international laws to regulate control and dominate nations that's a conspiracy
[35:39.500 --> 35:43.580]  theory according to media matters just by the fact that you know the head of the
[35:43.580 --> 35:50.020]  EU the head of the UN Gordon Brown Sarkozy anyone else you care to mention on
[35:50.020 --> 35:55.460]  any given day is saying precisely that I mean how how dumb do they take their
[35:55.460 --> 36:00.660]  readers for I mean no no surprise that this the writer of this article has
[36:00.660 --> 36:05.380]  chosen to remain an anonymous coward because all these claims are completely
[36:05.380 --> 36:11.780]  without any foundation whatsoever what do you think about this Julio in Illinois
[36:11.780 --> 36:17.980]  go ahead yeah Paul they also have about the council on foreign relations about
[36:17.980 --> 36:23.500]  geoengineering about that could be in conspiracy if anyone goes on Google and
[36:23.500 --> 36:27.940]  look up it looks up indirect and semi-direct aerosol campaign there's a
[36:27.940 --> 36:32.340]  link the third or fourth link from the council on foreign relations promoting
[36:32.340 --> 36:37.060]  aerosol campaigns chemtrails for climate change again these people think
[36:37.060 --> 36:41.980]  they're think we're think we the people are ignorant and we need to do a an
[36:41.980 --> 36:46.060]  article and put a third term number one and Paul how is it across the pond in
[36:46.060 --> 36:50.460]  chemtrails are people aware do people care or are they too busy at the pubs
[36:50.460 --> 36:56.380]  watching English Premier League soccer I know here people are just concerned
[36:56.380 --> 37:03.060]  with college football and the NFL how is it in in Great Britain well to respond
[37:03.060 --> 37:08.860]  to your first point I mean they they've got a section on Beck Jones and the CFR
[37:08.860 --> 37:14.540]  and they say that Jones has attacked the CFR and talked about how the CFR have
[37:14.540 --> 37:19.620]  advocated quote geoengineering projects and they reprint it again with no
[37:19.620 --> 37:24.580]  qualifying explanation for why it's a conspiracy theory without mentioning the
[37:24.580 --> 37:30.300]  fact that the council on foreign relations released a whole report a PDF
[37:30.300 --> 37:36.500]  document in May 2008 called geoengineering workshop on unilateral
[37:36.500 --> 37:41.620]  planetary scale geoengineering it's in their own documents they're released a
[37:41.620 --> 37:47.100]  report saying it needed to be done but when Jones talks about it it's a
[37:47.100 --> 37:52.180]  conspiracy theory and you know when Glenn Beck Glenn Beck doesn't even talk
[37:52.180 --> 37:56.740]  about geoengineering but they're using Alex they're trying to tie Alex to
[37:56.740 --> 38:02.860]  Beck to discredit Beck when everything that Alex talks about is laid out in
[38:02.860 --> 38:07.980]  the documents that the CFR themselves released I mean it's amazing with
[38:07.980 --> 38:14.740]  regard to people waking up to chemtrails in Britain there's a lady in Ireland I
[38:14.740 --> 38:20.220]  think the sovereign independent website has reported on this on a regular basis
[38:20.220 --> 38:25.660]  who is going to the Irish Parliament regularly to protest chemtrails and I
[38:25.660 --> 38:29.660]  think you'll only see that movement you know emerge as it becomes more and more
[38:29.660 --> 38:34.780]  obvious that these trails linger for hours and hours I mean I can see it for
[38:34.780 --> 38:39.780]  myself I'm right over the flight path of Birmingham Airport and I mean you know
[38:39.780 --> 38:44.820]  you barely get a sunny day at all it's always hazy and all the investigations
[38:44.820 --> 38:50.660]  into chemtrails the news the local news TV station that did the investigation
[38:50.660 --> 38:56.100]  found barium and these other heavy metal compounds that had emerged from these
[38:56.100 --> 39:00.940]  chemtrails that had dropped to the ground and then you read about the fact
[39:00.940 --> 39:06.740]  that they're advocating injecting the atmosphere with sulfur and it plays
[39:06.740 --> 39:11.300]  directly into what we're seeing in the skies of course side effects of sulfur
[39:11.300 --> 39:17.180]  the health effects are just dreadful including reducing the power of the
[39:17.180 --> 39:22.300]  immune system so I mean this is when that you know when they're talking about
[39:22.300 --> 39:26.060]  whether we should do geoengineering that they're already doing it and we're
[39:26.060 --> 39:30.780]  seeing the evidence for ourselves in the skies above us and like I said more and
[39:30.780 --> 39:35.060]  more people are becoming aware of it we're gonna move on to Liz in Illinois
[39:35.060 --> 39:38.660]  Liz you're on the air go ahead
[39:38.660 --> 39:48.820]  um I don't know sorry if this is a little bit off topic but I don't know I think needs to be said I I made your new philosophy but did take a
[39:48.820 --> 39:54.060]  number of women's studies classes that were actually very anti-globalization
[39:54.060 --> 39:59.100]  especially in the corporate end but I wanted to speak about the negatives of
[39:59.100 --> 40:05.260]  globalism from a feminist point of view I learned that globalization affects
[40:05.260 --> 40:12.140]  women most in most countries the worst like for example in factories they
[40:12.140 --> 40:16.100]  usually use female laborers because they're believed to be docile
[40:16.100 --> 40:22.100]  NASDA and GATT has caused mass migrations from Mexico and southern
[40:22.100 --> 40:27.820]  countries because they can't find work that isn't just slave wages they come
[40:27.820 --> 40:32.980]  here and when women are really at the bottom rung of their society like in a
[40:32.980 --> 40:38.900]  lot of countries and in a globalized economy when it's you know falling apart
[40:38.900 --> 40:44.740]  it's worse than the women in countries where they're considered less than men
[40:44.740 --> 40:50.380]  and you know and we women in the West are manipulated into thinking we're ugly
[40:50.380 --> 40:55.380]  convince us to starve ourselves to death to fit into clothing that was most
[40:55.380 --> 41:01.900]  likely made by a woman in a third world country paid slave wages and then Walmart
[41:01.900 --> 41:06.580]  sells the clothing and treats their woman badly but I really think that real
[41:06.580 --> 41:13.020]  feminism is breaking from the system that oppresses humanity as a whole not
[41:13.020 --> 41:17.540]  not bringing women into the system to work for it to vote for it and to pay
[41:17.540 --> 41:24.900]  taxes to it well that's exactly right I mean take for example Aaron Russo of
[41:24.900 --> 41:29.780]  course was close friends with Nick Rockefeller and Rockefeller told him
[41:29.780 --> 41:35.780]  directly that the early feminist movement was directly funded by the elite not to
[41:35.780 --> 41:44.180]  empower women not to you know encourage the growth of a fairer society it was
[41:44.180 --> 41:49.860]  done to turn them into tax slaves they only would were able to tax 50% of the
[41:49.860 --> 41:54.660]  population at the time after feminism you know not to say that women can't have
[41:54.660 --> 41:59.100]  careers but what it did do for the elite and this was the stated purpose as
[41:59.100 --> 42:04.380]  Rockefeller told Russo was that it got women out of the house it broke up
[42:04.380 --> 42:08.100]  families even more divorce rates went through the roof and of course they were
[42:08.100 --> 42:13.740]  able to tax another 50% of the population and as you've said globalization is
[42:13.740 --> 42:19.860]  about basically shipping your job off to a third world country where slaves who
[42:19.860 --> 42:25.300]  are treated like dirt a lot of them women do your job for peanuts and that's
[42:25.300 --> 42:30.900]  the the destruction that globalization has wrought on the economy thanks for
[42:30.900 --> 42:38.460]  the call is Mike in Minnesota go ahead Mike how you doing I think all the
[42:38.460 --> 42:44.420]  politicians have perverted our political system we need to restructure this
[42:44.420 --> 42:51.460]  government where the bankers can't get their fingers into the cookie jar our
[42:51.460 --> 42:57.660]  job I don't know if you know like from 15 years ago we had a very strong
[42:57.660 --> 43:03.580]  country 20 years ago even stronger but I don't know if people remember this one
[43:03.580 --> 43:08.260]  last pro-Rampal president he said if this nasty thing goes through you're
[43:08.260 --> 43:13.140]  gonna hear sucking sound of all the jobs leaving this country and pretty much
[43:13.140 --> 43:18.220]  that's what's happened the fucking jobs have left the country and then it started
[43:18.220 --> 43:23.740]  off with our politicians letting all these illegals into the country and they
[43:23.740 --> 43:29.420]  knew most of the math population of the United States did not like it they
[43:29.420 --> 43:35.460]  wanted them to stop it but they did nothing to stop it and then once we our
[43:35.460 --> 43:42.060]  country got diluted with illegal aliens and then they turn around and now they're
[43:42.060 --> 43:49.140]  shipping all the jobs to China where prisoners not just women prisoners are
[43:49.140 --> 43:54.780]  taking your job you no longer have a job if you're listening to me because of
[43:54.780 --> 44:02.660]  this and then all the factories are moving there and now all it just it's a
[44:02.660 --> 44:08.860]  collapse we're in a collapse right now and in the England what they did when
[44:08.860 --> 44:15.140]  this happened way back they would go after the king kill him what do you think
[44:15.140 --> 44:20.420]  about that well I mean it's like what Max Kaiser said in France you know they
[44:20.420 --> 44:23.980]  beheaded people but you know I mean you're not only using your jobs to
[44:23.980 --> 44:28.860]  prisoners in China you're losing them to prisoners in America there's a
[44:28.860 --> 44:34.020]  whole industry based around it so that sucking sound is very clear as we
[44:34.020 --> 44:40.220]  approach 2011 as globalization has wrought its deadly consequences on
[44:40.220 --> 44:44.420]  America and the rest of the world thanks for the call Corey in France go
[44:44.420 --> 44:50.100]  ahead Corey hey Paul I'm a first-time caller I'm originally from Wisconsin but
[44:50.100 --> 44:55.620]  now I live here in France where do you live in France the protests going on
[44:55.620 --> 45:00.380]  here in France huh yeah where are you based in France I got some interesting
[45:00.380 --> 45:04.620]  information I speak French so I get to read the newspapers and online stuff
[45:04.620 --> 45:09.500]  and one of the guys from the left party the Socialist Party he's actually the
[45:09.500 --> 45:15.300]  chairman he came out and he's saying that agent provocateurs have been
[45:15.300 --> 45:20.900]  infiltrating the protests and causing violence now we are we were an article
[45:20.900 --> 45:26.380]  about it last week basically he said that these black balaclava wearing
[45:26.380 --> 45:31.660]  anarchists who are from the schools were basically completely discrediting the
[45:31.660 --> 45:37.700]  unions burning cars and throwing rocks through Starbucks front windows doesn't
[45:37.700 --> 45:41.860]  really do an awful lot to stop the government moving ahead blockading
[45:41.860 --> 45:46.420]  fuel depots certainly does get their attention but as we've explained all
[45:46.420 --> 45:52.900]  along these are black block anarchists are nothing but useful idiots that the
[45:52.900 --> 45:57.500]  establishment exploits on a regular basis to its own ends you know the
[45:57.500 --> 46:02.580]  support rate for the unions was running at 70 80% in the media when these
[46:02.580 --> 46:07.420]  protests began as soon as you had all the images of anarchists smashing up
[46:07.420 --> 46:11.500]  shop windows and burning cars that approval amongst the rest of the
[46:11.500 --> 46:17.140]  population soon began to sank and of course the pension reform is awaiting
[46:17.140 --> 46:22.460]  final signature I believe today but where are you based in France Corey I mean
[46:22.460 --> 46:27.900]  have you had trouble getting petrol getting gas I'm here in Leo France which
[46:27.900 --> 46:32.580]  is about an hour north of Paris so I'm really far north in France and most a
[46:32.580 --> 46:36.140]  lot of the gas stations here ran out of gas a couple days ago but they've got
[46:36.140 --> 46:41.260]  more fuel now but I don't have a car but the gas station next to my house they
[46:41.260 --> 46:45.540]  were out of fuel for a couple days but I just wanted to add about what this guy
[46:45.540 --> 46:50.460]  said he said that people witnessed people in plain clothes going in the
[46:50.460 --> 46:54.620]  crowd throwing stones smashing windows and then they would walk out and put
[46:54.620 --> 46:59.540]  their police armband on well they were actually you know they were playing
[46:59.540 --> 47:03.740]  closed people protesting they would go smash windows break things and then they
[47:03.740 --> 47:09.540]  would walk out with the riot police and he has a picture on his blog with two
[47:09.540 --> 47:13.460]  gentlemen in plain clothes that have armbands on right next to riot police
[47:13.460 --> 47:17.860]  and they have their faces covered up in the hoods over their heads so was this
[47:17.860 --> 47:24.340]  reported in the mainstream news I'm sorry was this reported in mainstream news
[47:24.340 --> 47:29.820]  yeah it actually was they mainly talked about just the accusations of him
[47:29.820 --> 47:37.060]  saying that police are doing this but it's in like the French press agency the
[47:37.060 --> 47:42.500]  TF1 the 20 minutes but I haven't found anything about it in English speaking
[47:42.500 --> 47:48.060]  news agencies just French speaking news Wow if you could send me an email
[47:48.060 --> 47:52.460]  Watson at prisonplanet.com with those links and that information I'll
[47:52.460 --> 47:57.380]  definitely be interested in doing a story on that thanks for the call we
[47:57.380 --> 48:04.180]  went to John in Ohio who disagrees go ahead John yes I am I was interested in
[48:04.180 --> 48:09.180]  last caller because he mentioned that the exposure of police police agent
[48:09.180 --> 48:14.020]  provocateurs and government provocateurs really false flag terrorism was
[48:14.020 --> 48:19.780]  exposed by a socialist organization in France I think that people ought to
[48:19.780 --> 48:25.180]  realize that we've been lied to about the nature of left and socialist pro
[48:25.180 --> 48:31.260]  organizations I used to listen to Alex Jones and loved the populism the
[48:31.260 --> 48:38.380]  anti-establishmentism but lately my disagreements with which was originally
[48:38.380 --> 48:43.060]  they're copying the IMF and the World Bank and the Wall Street's policies
[48:43.060 --> 48:48.700]  of attacking any kind of social assistance program any kind of welfare
[48:48.700 --> 48:53.260]  welfare safety net programs as something that despicable nanny state
[48:53.260 --> 48:58.860]  exactly copied the plans across the world now to impose this kind of
[48:58.860 --> 49:02.940]  slashing of these programs and all living standards to funnel the money into
[49:02.940 --> 49:07.580]  the World Bank and the Wall Street vultures and I'm also very concerned
[49:07.580 --> 49:14.940]  that this has even worsened now that this support for Rand Paul the fact that
[49:14.940 --> 49:20.660]  media matters is a front for often for the White House doesn't obscure the
[49:20.660 --> 49:24.260]  fact that there are good reasons to oppose Rand Paul the fact that he is
[49:24.260 --> 49:30.780]  out and really a neocon Zionist who supported very servily everything
[49:30.780 --> 49:35.580]  that Israel is done in instigating trying to instigate war against Iran
[49:35.580 --> 49:40.060]  sending out a post to all of his supporters saying that anything that
[49:40.060 --> 49:44.580]  Israel wants to do including war against anyone in the region and and against
[49:44.580 --> 49:50.260]  Iran is perfectly supportable this is that this is the line of the Zionist
[49:50.260 --> 49:54.460]  this guy may not be their favorite neocon but he is an absolute neocon and
[49:54.460 --> 49:59.340]  it violates everything that I think Alex Jones who I agree on some of his
[49:59.340 --> 50:03.140]  positions but not on his right wing positions says he is opposed to in
[50:03.140 --> 50:07.620]  these wars against Iran and Iraq and the rest of it round Paul is strictly on
[50:07.620 --> 50:13.380]  the other side and I think it's okay thanks for the call yeah Sharon angle
[50:13.380 --> 50:18.740]  Rand Paul they've got proposals they've got policies that not all of us agree
[50:18.740 --> 50:22.980]  with but the fact that the Obama administration media front groups
[50:22.980 --> 50:27.300]  viciously attacking them on a daily basis suggests that they see them as a
[50:27.300 --> 50:31.820]  threat now we've wrote countless articles about how the higher echelons of
[50:31.820 --> 50:36.060]  the Tea Party has completely been infiltrated by Republicans yet there
[50:36.060 --> 50:40.820]  are still some candidates who aren't part of that takeover I firmly believe
[50:40.820 --> 50:45.100]  that Rand Paul and Sharon angle are two of them may not agree with their
[50:45.100 --> 50:49.100]  geopolitical policies but I think if they got into office that's something we
[50:49.100 --> 50:54.460]  could certainly turn their ear on they do get into office we'll be going to the

[54:14.660 --> 54:19.820]  it's the final segment of the Alex Jones show on this Monday Tuesday sorry
[54:19.820 --> 54:25.460]  October 26 2010 now caller before the break was talking about Rand Paul's
[54:25.460 --> 54:31.020]  support for Israel now to be sure Rand Paul has come out with some terse
[54:31.020 --> 54:36.780]  rhetoric on his website about a so-called special relationship between the
[54:36.780 --> 54:41.860]  United States and Israel basically he's playing politics to get the support of
[54:41.860 --> 54:46.660]  Republican voters go back to his original newsletters things that he
[54:46.660 --> 54:50.220]  actually did write about unlike the things that the mainstream media says he
[54:50.220 --> 54:55.020]  wrote about which he had nothing to do with whatsoever you read what Ron Paul
[54:55.020 --> 55:00.540]  actually said quote by far the most powerful lobby in Washington of the
[55:00.540 --> 55:05.780]  bad sore is the Israeli government and he said that the goal of the Zionist
[55:05.780 --> 55:10.980]  movement was to stifle criticism of Israel so that's what Rand Paul said
[55:10.980 --> 55:16.260]  in his own independent political newsletter back in the early 90s so just
[55:16.260 --> 55:20.740]  because because he comes out with some terse statement saying he supports you
[55:20.740 --> 55:26.980]  know America's allies he's playing politics to get votes I mean come on look
[55:26.980 --> 55:33.620]  at his dad look at his newsletters from the early 90s I think the true foundation
[55:33.620 --> 55:37.700]  of Rand Paul's geopolitical outlook would quickly become clear if he was
[55:37.700 --> 55:43.060]  elected and that would be of the limited viewpoint of defense and not
[55:43.060 --> 55:47.620]  occupying foreign countries that similar to that embraced by his father Ron Paul
[55:47.620 --> 55:52.300]  so I mean just go back and look at what Rand Paul actually wrote and the
[55:52.300 --> 55:57.220]  documents the ideas that were the foundational basis of his entry into
[55:57.220 --> 56:02.700]  politics in the first place we're going to go to Ronald in Jersey sorry yeah
[56:02.700 --> 56:09.140]  Ronald in Jersey go ahead you're on the air Ronald fine go ahead Ron what's
[56:09.140 --> 56:13.740]  on your mind it's a little bit off topic but I wanted to talk about this a
[56:13.740 --> 56:17.260]  little bit I know a lot of people appreciate my country because it's an
[56:17.260 --> 56:23.140]  endemic problem what I was 17 years old I was sold that you know I needed to go
[56:23.140 --> 56:27.500]  to college and that getting a college degree regardless of basically what it
[56:27.500 --> 56:32.580]  was in was important and my parents you know signed a student loans we signed a
[56:32.580 --> 56:37.860]  promissory note jointly and basically now that the globalism has helped
[56:37.860 --> 56:41.460]  crash the system you know we've subsidized our own failure and we've
[56:41.460 --> 56:45.140]  been convinced that low prices and buying cheap products for China would
[56:45.140 --> 56:50.580]  benefit us you know you know well I'm unable to pay this debt and you know
[56:50.580 --> 56:55.180]  it's been I've been put in such a position where you know the debt is not
[56:55.180 --> 57:01.580]  even dismissible in bankruptcy court it's basically a surf to you know the
[57:01.580 --> 57:05.780]  bankers and they took this they take this promissory note and just like the
[57:05.780 --> 57:12.100]  mortgage fraud they sell it to they sell it ten and twelve times over and make
[57:12.100 --> 57:16.740]  money up and down and I'm expected to pay this debt for the rest of my life it
[57:16.740 --> 57:20.140]  can't get from under it so I wanted to see if you had any for specific
[57:20.140 --> 57:24.500]  information about student loans and you know the fraud that's behind them as
[57:24.500 --> 57:29.540]  well as most other debt instruments in our country well that's right I mean in
[57:29.540 --> 57:33.020]  the in the UK a lot of people think you can get away from student loans by
[57:33.020 --> 57:37.860]  simply moving out I'm afraid that's not the case as he said they hound you down
[57:37.860 --> 57:43.580]  and it's this whole process of you know getting you into debt simply to be
[57:43.580 --> 57:46.940]  indoctrinated to become a servant of the establishment which is what
[57:46.940 --> 57:52.300]  university is all about I went to university and it's it's about parroting
[57:52.300 --> 57:56.940]  what they tell you the best university student is somebody who can regurgitate
[57:56.940 --> 58:00.900]  wholesale what's fed into them they don't teach you how to think and if you
[58:00.900 --> 58:04.660]  go to YouTube and watch them valedictorian speaks out against
[58:04.660 --> 58:09.620]  schooling I think that will exemplify exactly what I'm talking about in that
[58:09.620 --> 58:14.740]  context final caller Martin Florida quickly 30 seconds go ahead
[58:14.740 --> 58:20.620]  you were talking about how there's a debate fraud and it's true in Florida
[58:20.620 --> 58:26.260]  there's a libertarian Senate candidate who's being restrained from being in the
[58:26.260 --> 58:30.940]  debates due to the fact that the three candidates plus the media got the
[58:30.940 --> 58:35.220]  web we've got a story on the website stay tuned Alex is back tomorrow prison

[01:01:28.380 --> 01:01:31.940]  well this is a short segment but just you told everybody what was going to
[01:01:31.940 --> 01:01:36.260]  happen how did you know and what did you say was gonna unfold and where are we
[01:01:36.260 --> 01:01:41.060]  going from here well the pieces came together back in 1972 I was a Marine
[01:01:41.060 --> 01:01:45.860]  Corps pilot flying over Vietnam and I saw the Vietnamese people panicking and
[01:01:45.860 --> 01:01:49.820]  they wouldn't accept US dollars and they wouldn't accept piasta their
[01:01:49.820 --> 01:01:55.180]  currency and all they wanted was gold and I knew something was up at that point
[01:01:55.180 --> 01:01:59.260]  and over the years the pieces just kept coming together so that's where it
[01:01:59.260 --> 01:02:03.860]  started for me that's when you really started to learn how monetary systems
[01:02:03.860 --> 01:02:07.660]  really work well the pieces like I said I wish I could say I knew I mean even
[01:02:07.660 --> 01:02:11.220]  today as much as I know they still it's still smoking mirrors as far as I'm
[01:02:11.220 --> 01:02:16.100]  concerned absolutely but going back just in the last five six years you've
[01:02:16.100 --> 01:02:19.580]  predicted exactly what's happening now yeah well that's not hard to do I mean
[01:02:19.580 --> 01:02:23.820]  all you do is listen to what Greenspan was saying and Bernack he was saying and
[01:02:23.820 --> 01:02:27.760]  Clinton and Bush and he kind of gets the idea that you're being you know it's
[01:02:27.760 --> 01:02:32.700]  screwed so it wasn't that hard to figure it out it's just I think the toughest
[01:02:32.700 --> 01:02:37.780]  thing for people is what can I do what can I as an individual do and I think
[01:02:37.780 --> 01:02:42.940]  that's where my company Rich Dad comes in as we teach people how to avoid the
[01:02:42.940 --> 01:02:51.980]  pitfalls of falling prey to the ultra rich you know let's get into falling
[01:02:51.980 --> 01:02:55.940]  prey to the ultra rich this system they've created to destroy our wealth and
[01:02:55.940 --> 01:02:58.860]  transfer to themselves then we'll get into your solutions after the break but
[01:02:58.860 --> 01:03:02.260]  when you talk about falling prey to them how are people falling prey to them
[01:03:02.260 --> 01:03:06.940]  what are their what are their traps they're laying well the idea of saving
[01:03:06.940 --> 01:03:11.140]  money that's ridiculous was after after 71 when Nixon broke the Brent Woods
[01:03:11.140 --> 01:03:16.020]  agreement and put us on the dollar standard not the gold standard that
[01:03:16.020 --> 01:03:21.820]  anybody who was saving money was the biggest loser and in 1974 the government
[01:03:21.820 --> 01:03:27.460]  passed Orissa Employee Employee Retirement Employee Retirement Income
[01:03:27.460 --> 01:03:32.540]  Security Act and the reason they did that as best I can tell is because my
[01:03:32.540 --> 01:03:36.660]  general my father's generation the World War II generation wasn't in the stock
[01:03:36.660 --> 01:03:40.700]  market because they got hammered during the Great Depression so guys like my
[01:03:40.700 --> 01:03:45.580]  dad you know he wouldn't go into the stock market so in 74 they passed Orissa
[01:03:45.580 --> 01:03:51.540]  which is now the 401k and now they require most employees to put their money
[01:03:51.540 --> 01:03:57.380]  into a mutual fund and I don't know if you know the ratio but John Bogle of
[01:03:57.380 --> 01:04:01.700]  Vanguard says you put up 100% of the money you take 100% of the risk and
[01:04:01.700 --> 01:04:06.620]  they take 80% of the profits and this compounding expenses this rips the
[01:04:06.620 --> 01:04:09.940]  little guy apart they don't have a prayer for their retirement but they have
[01:04:09.940 --> 01:04:14.580]  all these well-paid pitchmen out there to give people you know the illusion that
[01:04:14.580 --> 01:04:18.220]  they're making a smart investment right and then what happens in our schools is
[01:04:18.220 --> 01:04:22.780]  the bankers go to the school to tell you kids to save money at the same time the
[01:04:22.780 --> 01:04:28.660]  Fred may know Obama printed what 1.9 trillion and then they keep telling you
[01:04:28.660 --> 01:04:32.860]  to invest for the long term in the stock market and as you know long-term
[01:04:32.860 --> 01:04:37.020]  investors for the last 10 years have made zero they've actually lost money but
[01:04:37.020 --> 01:04:41.780]  gold's up four-fold though they try to suppress it Robert Kiyosaki Rich Dad
[01:04:41.780 --> 01:04:46.260]  com an icon out there no need to really introduce him we're gonna come back from
[01:04:46.260 --> 01:04:49.780]  this quick break and give him the floor to walk through the pitfalls of the
[01:04:49.780 --> 01:04:53.980]  elite the scam investments versus what he does with his money to great success

[01:06:26.340 --> 01:06:30.500]  legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather
[01:06:30.500 --> 01:06:34.460]  is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their

[01:09:59.420 --> 01:10:03.900]  prison planet dot TV Robert you started getting into some of the ways they
[01:10:03.900 --> 01:10:07.260]  transfer our wealth let's go over that and then ways to protect ourselves and
[01:10:07.260 --> 01:10:12.020]  then where you see this society and economy going Robert well when you say
[01:10:12.020 --> 01:10:16.380]  to your child go to school get good grades and get a safe secure job the
[01:10:16.380 --> 01:10:21.420]  moment you've done that you've programmed to pay taxes at that point so the
[01:10:21.420 --> 01:10:26.620]  harder you work the higher percentage of taxes you pay and then they tell you to
[01:10:26.620 --> 01:10:32.060]  save money and the problem with saving money as you know from the you know the
[01:10:32.060 --> 01:10:36.940]  fractional reserve system the Fed and the Treasury allowed to print money so
[01:10:36.940 --> 01:10:41.500]  your money is devalued in the savings plan the third when they print money
[01:10:41.500 --> 01:10:45.500]  you're eaten alive by inflation and you can see inflation creeping up in food
[01:10:45.500 --> 01:10:50.180]  right now and in the fourth way is they tell you to put it into a retirement
[01:10:50.180 --> 01:10:55.340]  plan filled with mutual funds stocks bonds and things like that and what
[01:10:55.340 --> 01:11:01.700]  happens is the taxes go against the person who does that but also their
[01:11:01.700 --> 01:11:06.460]  money is flowing to the rich now I don't I'm not saying it's wrong because you
[01:11:06.460 --> 01:11:11.620]  know every coin has two sides so the money is always flowing to guys like me
[01:11:11.620 --> 01:11:16.540]  so when I write rich dad poor dad and all this I'm saying look that money in
[01:11:16.540 --> 01:11:22.260]  savings is going to me your money in your 401k is going to me and when you pay
[01:11:22.260 --> 01:11:26.900]  taxes that money goes to me and I do mean me so that's why I wrote rich dad
[01:11:26.900 --> 01:11:31.700]  poor dad was to wake people up and say look you only have basically two choices
[01:11:31.700 --> 01:11:36.740]  you're either going to make the money or have your money stolen and that's the
[01:11:36.740 --> 01:11:42.380]  system it's terrible well earlier you were talking about the pension funds and
[01:11:42.380 --> 01:11:48.340]  the ratio and 401ks the mutual funds now they're openly this is already
[01:11:48.340 --> 01:11:52.220]  happening in Europe it's called austerity we're almost all the taxes we pay
[01:11:52.220 --> 01:11:56.860]  goes to service debt that they made out of nothing via fractional reserve
[01:11:56.860 --> 01:12:02.220]  banking and now the derivative scan that even leverages it further and we know
[01:12:02.220 --> 01:12:07.340]  that now they're announcing oh we're going to save Social Security by raising
[01:12:07.340 --> 01:12:12.220]  the tax we're going to save your private pension fund your 401k by taking it and
[01:12:12.220 --> 01:12:16.500]  putting a tax on it and so now as people get ready to retire and record
[01:12:16.500 --> 01:12:21.260]  amounts magically they're changing the system to steal most of that as well and
[01:12:21.260 --> 01:12:24.700]  then through government-run health care they make you pay into the system I mean
[01:12:24.700 --> 01:12:29.980]  it's incredible it's fascism is what it is it's not even socialism anymore you
[01:12:29.980 --> 01:12:33.340]  know fascism was like where the government does it at the point of a gun
[01:12:33.340 --> 01:12:38.620]  to fortunate do things yes and that's what that's what you know I fought in
[01:12:38.620 --> 01:12:43.340]  Vietnam twice and I didn't fight for fascism or socialism I fought for
[01:12:43.340 --> 01:12:48.220]  capitalism and I think that's what's being robbed from us it is a free capital
[01:12:48.220 --> 01:12:52.100]  of society go through the basics and talk about some of your new books
[01:12:52.100 --> 01:12:56.460]  conspiracy of the rich eight ways the eight new rules of money and a unfair
[01:12:56.460 --> 01:13:00.380]  advantage on one of the newest books but I mean go through specifically then
[01:13:00.380 --> 01:13:05.180]  quantify what you mean by when you pay taxes it goes to you know Ben Bernanke
[01:13:05.180 --> 01:13:10.540]  when you pay when you make money they get it so something I mean how do you
[01:13:10.540 --> 01:13:13.980]  make money and keep it explain that well let me explain there's always two sides
[01:13:13.980 --> 01:13:20.380]  of a coin I've never seen a one-sided coin yet so the tax laws are really
[01:13:20.380 --> 01:13:25.820]  designed to make the rich richer the problem is if you go to school and get
[01:13:25.820 --> 01:13:31.500]  a job will become a doctor or lawyer the tax then flows to the rich so a guy
[01:13:31.500 --> 01:13:36.380]  like me I have never made I have made more money in the last three years
[01:13:36.380 --> 01:13:45.180]  2007 2010 tax free and so debt and taxes work with those with financial
[01:13:45.180 --> 01:13:51.180]  education debt and taxes work against those without financial education so
[01:13:51.180 --> 01:13:55.740]  you go to Harvard or Oxford and all this is still no nothing about debt and
[01:13:55.740 --> 01:14:01.500]  taxes I am millions of dollars in debt but that debt makes me rich tax-free
[01:14:01.500 --> 01:14:06.100]  and that's where financial education kicks in this stuff they teach kids to
[01:14:06.100 --> 01:14:09.860]  put your money in a mutual fund I'm glad they do that because that's where I get
[01:14:09.860 --> 01:14:14.140]  my money from that's the really the two-second side of the coin okay explain
[01:14:14.140 --> 01:14:18.900]  that to people well there's two kinds of people either part your money which is
[01:14:18.900 --> 01:14:23.380]  savings and pensions and people who move their money this in in my world of
[01:14:23.380 --> 01:14:28.740]  finances called the velocity of money I want my money back as soon as possible
[01:14:28.740 --> 01:14:32.820]  so I can buy another asset and I mean an asset that's not sponsored mutual funds
[01:14:32.820 --> 01:14:38.740]  so I'm constantly moving my money and what the system the banking system does
[01:14:38.740 --> 01:14:43.940]  is programs you to park your money so you put it into savings and you you know
[01:14:43.940 --> 01:14:48.180]  the save save save save and then you put it in a retirement plan let's say
[01:14:48.180 --> 01:14:54.580]  starting at 25 and you hope is there at 65 I do not do that and a financial
[01:14:54.580 --> 01:15:00.340]  education would teach you how debt and taxes make the rich richer and that's
[01:15:00.340 --> 01:15:04.020]  all I'm saying to people when I wrote rich dad poor dad I said your house is
[01:15:04.020 --> 01:15:09.460]  not an asset it's the bank's asset and if you could wake up to that oh no no
[01:15:09.460 --> 01:15:13.020]  you don't know what you're talking about and now we have people who are
[01:15:13.020 --> 01:15:16.420]  walking away from their mortgages because the mortgages worth more than the
[01:15:16.420 --> 01:15:22.940]  house and that's what a little financial education these guys wouldn't be able to
[01:15:22.940 --> 01:15:26.700]  brainwash it with you I'm not going to go to bad people I'm saying if you don't
[01:15:26.700 --> 01:15:31.740]  know someone's gonna pick your pocket and and your books quantify that down to
[01:15:31.740 --> 01:15:34.820]  find detail but but give people the basics as they're saying well what is
[01:15:34.820 --> 01:15:41.380]  this Robert you know talking about what is he saying here I mean tell us what
[01:15:41.380 --> 01:15:45.540]  you do with your money and and what the rich do with their money okay first of
[01:15:45.540 --> 01:15:48.660]  all there's two books people should read they want to understand rich dad rich
[01:15:48.660 --> 01:15:53.220]  dad poor dad was really the basics and rich dad poor dad is a book on accounting
[01:15:53.220 --> 01:15:59.860]  but it sold 24 million copies because it explains what our school system doesn't
[01:15:59.860 --> 01:16:04.180]  teach you even in accounting classes and the second book is a book called the
[01:16:04.180 --> 01:16:08.580]  cash flow quadrant and a quadrant is the four people that make up the world of
[01:16:08.580 --> 01:16:13.220]  money the e-quadrant stands for employees so you could be a CEO or a
[01:16:13.220 --> 01:16:17.940]  janitor the trouble with the e-quadrant is that's the highest the second highest
[01:16:17.940 --> 01:16:22.060]  tax of all the quadrants that started in nineteen forty through the current tax
[01:16:22.060 --> 01:16:27.180]  payment act which went against the Constitution and they could tax they the
[01:16:27.180 --> 01:16:32.180]  government got paid before the employee got paid now the next quadrant is the
[01:16:32.180 --> 01:16:36.580]  s-quadrant which stands for small business self-employed or specialist like
[01:16:36.580 --> 01:16:43.060]  a doctoral lawyer the tax laws changed for them in 1986 with the tax reform act
[01:16:43.060 --> 01:16:46.380]  and they were just you know that was part of the Reagan thing they were trying
[01:16:46.380 --> 01:16:51.020]  to collect more taxes on the right side of the quadrant there's B and B stands
[01:16:51.020 --> 01:16:56.940]  for big business 500 employees or more and I stands for investor there's an
[01:16:56.940 --> 01:17:02.220]  investor class now many people invest like they invest in a mutual fund but
[01:17:02.220 --> 01:17:07.500]  they're not they invest but they're not investors investors are pure capitalists
[01:17:07.500 --> 01:17:12.180]  because they're always raising capital so for a guy like me since I have more
[01:17:12.180 --> 01:17:17.740]  than 500 employees and I'm always raising capital via debt and things like that I
[01:17:17.740 --> 01:17:24.260]  pay no tax see if you look at the tax code the internal revenue tax code most
[01:17:24.260 --> 01:17:29.980]  of the code is how to avoid taxes but the trouble is if you go to school and
[01:17:29.980 --> 01:17:33.740]  you're taught by the socialists of the school system they're actually teaching
[01:17:33.740 --> 01:17:39.100]  you to be the proletariat the working class working for the bourgeois the rich
[01:17:39.100 --> 01:17:44.300]  and I don't want to be bourgeois I just want to be a capitalist I don't want to
[01:17:44.300 --> 01:17:49.100]  pay all that tax if the government needs guys like me who provides jobs and I
[01:17:49.100 --> 01:17:54.540]  have large apartment houses and I have oil wells I produce constantly so the
[01:17:54.540 --> 01:17:58.300]  tax laws are written for me except the school system doesn't tell you about
[01:17:58.300 --> 01:18:02.820]  the other side of the coin so how do you how are you you know physically you know
[01:18:02.820 --> 01:18:06.340]  living nice houses have a lot of money sell you know tens of millions of books
[01:18:06.340 --> 01:18:11.500]  but then not paying any taxes well because debt and taxes are written for
[01:18:11.500 --> 01:18:16.460]  people on the B and the I side of the quadrant you see what you have to when
[01:18:16.460 --> 01:18:21.060]  1973 I came back from Vietnam I was a Marine helicopter pilot went down three
[01:18:21.060 --> 01:18:25.940]  times I refuse to fight anymore I'd had it because I knew I was being lied to by
[01:18:25.940 --> 01:18:30.540]  government so I come home and I asked my poor dad the head of education what should
[01:18:30.540 --> 01:18:35.700]  I do he says why don't you go fly for the airlines I said well then I become a pawn
[01:18:35.700 --> 01:18:40.060]  of the system so if I went to listen to my rich dad and became an entrepreneur
[01:18:40.060 --> 01:18:44.860]  because I did understand a little bit about tax incentives and investing up
[01:18:44.860 --> 01:18:49.700]  like this so I took up real estate courses starting in 1973 because you
[01:18:49.700 --> 01:18:54.740]  have to learn to manage debt because as you know is after 71 that the dollar
[01:18:54.740 --> 01:19:00.460]  became debt so you have to learn to manage debt so today I borrow millions
[01:19:00.460 --> 01:19:04.580]  of dollars tax-free I buy these apartment houses there are a hundred
[01:19:04.580 --> 01:19:09.940]  percent finance and I've done this most of my life I have no equity into the
[01:19:09.940 --> 01:19:16.020]  property and the more I use bank money OPM the less I pay in taxes then I get
[01:19:16.020 --> 01:19:21.420]  things like depreciation amortization and those other tax incentives because I
[01:19:21.420 --> 01:19:26.580]  provide large apartment houses because the government needs housing for people
[01:19:26.580 --> 01:19:31.740]  also I get tax incentives for oil production I don't buy oil stocks like I
[01:19:31.740 --> 01:19:37.060]  would never touch Exxon or BP shares what I want is a percentage of the
[01:19:37.060 --> 01:19:42.060]  production so when the prices of oil go up I make more money it goes down I
[01:19:42.060 --> 01:19:45.980]  still make money because the moment let's say I invest a hundred thousand
[01:19:45.980 --> 01:19:49.780]  dollars in oil production I get a 28 percent return on my capital
[01:19:49.780 --> 01:19:54.700]  instantaneous tell you what stay there let's continue to quantify this with
[01:19:54.700 --> 01:19:59.620]  Robert Kiyosaki of rich dad calm I'm Alex Jones of prison planet calm stay
[01:19:59.620 --> 01:20:03.780]  with us is it really possible to get out of debt without payment plans or

[01:24:09.460 --> 01:24:14.780]  oil well operations or drilling operations the average person who can't
[01:24:14.780 --> 01:24:19.820]  buy be a big apartment houses and most people actually know in Austin have done
[01:24:19.820 --> 01:24:23.980]  well over time that's exactly what they do do what does the average person start
[01:24:23.980 --> 01:24:29.540]  doing to get in the right quadrant that's a great question my whole stick is
[01:24:29.540 --> 01:24:33.660]  why don't we have financial education our schools you see that's where it starts
[01:24:33.660 --> 01:24:39.020]  and that's where the brainwashing begins you talk about info when I was in
[01:24:39.020 --> 01:24:42.220]  public school that's all they taught me was how great 401ks I'm sorry you said
[01:24:42.220 --> 01:24:47.740]  that's where the info war starts now it's like you know the NEA the National
[01:24:47.740 --> 01:24:53.100]  Education Association forms calls of the National Extortion Association and they
[01:24:53.100 --> 01:25:00.420]  really are agents of the ultra risk to prevent people from knowing how the tax
[01:25:00.420 --> 01:25:05.580]  and debt systems work so all I did was having a rich dad who didn't go to school
[01:25:05.580 --> 01:25:10.540]  my best friend's father if I he's he kind of helped me crack the code and it
[01:25:10.540 --> 01:25:14.980]  began to understand why you know why there's no financial education our
[01:25:14.980 --> 01:25:20.420]  schools why did they try and control the media all the time and I got to be
[01:25:20.420 --> 01:25:25.340]  very suspicious and I'm not against our troops but I went to Vietnam twice and
[01:25:25.340 --> 01:25:29.660]  I realized I was being lied to and so that's when I kind of woke up and said
[01:25:29.660 --> 01:25:33.140]  okay I'm gonna listen to my rich dad I'm gonna find out what's really going on
[01:25:33.140 --> 01:25:37.060]  so that's all I do when I write rich dad poor dad I'd say your house is not an
[01:25:37.060 --> 01:25:41.660]  asset I got hate mail from my friend to a realtor you know I didn't say don't buy
[01:25:41.660 --> 01:25:47.740]  a house it's not an asset and and you know in 19 I mean 2002 I wrote rich dad's
[01:25:47.740 --> 01:25:52.340]  prophecy and it was about the biggest stock market crashed in history that's
[01:25:52.340 --> 01:25:56.940]  still coming and it's about the 401k and at that time Wall Street Journal smart
[01:25:56.940 --> 01:26:01.380]  money and Money Magazine just hung me up the flagpole it was the second cruise
[01:26:01.380 --> 01:26:06.260]  affection you know I was like cheese I remember yeah I could crucified by those
[01:26:06.260 --> 01:26:10.100]  guys and then today our school system still bring in the bankers and tell you
[01:26:10.100 --> 01:26:13.620]  to save money and they still bring in the financial planners and tell you to
[01:26:13.620 --> 01:26:17.500]  put your money in a 401k for the long term and I'm saying that's another side
[01:26:17.500 --> 01:26:22.380]  to that that's where I make my money is on ignorance and all I do in a rich dad
[01:26:22.380 --> 01:26:26.420]  is I listen to the other side that's a free country make your choice okay so
[01:26:26.420 --> 01:26:30.140]  you're somebody making $200,000 a year keeping about a hundred thousand
[01:26:30.140 --> 01:26:34.380]  after taxes what what does Robert Keyless how can you do I would take a
[01:26:34.380 --> 01:26:38.740]  class you know in 1973 I took classes on real estate I don't you know
[01:26:38.740 --> 01:26:42.660]  residential real estate I meet these idiots like in my account he says yeah
[01:26:42.660 --> 01:26:46.700]  I'm a real estate investor I own a house I said no you're a consumer you're not an
[01:26:46.700 --> 01:26:51.660]  investor no I'm an investor but it's such war run they don't nothing about tax
[01:26:51.660 --> 01:26:56.100]  code and all this stuff and property management and all the things that make
[01:26:56.100 --> 01:27:02.100]  you rich so I started off back in 1973 little one bedroom one bath condo on the
[01:27:02.100 --> 01:27:07.740]  on the beach of Maui and that's where it began today on about 4,000 units five
[01:27:07.740 --> 01:27:11.020]  golf courses luxury hotels well production throughout the world and
[01:27:11.020 --> 01:27:15.180]  business throughout the world goldmine silver but I didn't listen to the school
[01:27:15.180 --> 01:27:18.660]  system and that's the difference well that's like ten years ago they said do
[01:27:18.660 --> 01:27:21.940]  not buy gold and silver it's a bad investment they're still saying it but
[01:27:21.940 --> 01:27:27.020]  it's a 1980 inflation it's supposed to be 2,500 an ounce issue to see me I was in
[01:27:27.020 --> 01:27:32.140]  2000 on CNBC and they said what are you investing I said gold they said that's
[01:27:32.140 --> 01:27:38.860]  stupid it's 275 an ounce I said that's smart but they don't want gold to go up
[01:27:38.860 --> 01:27:43.180]  as you know because it means the fiat currency of the world is gonna come
[01:27:43.180 --> 01:27:48.020]  apart and when it does gold's go into the moon and and right now if you don't
[01:27:48.020 --> 01:27:50.980]  have much money and I've been saying this for years because I'm actually at
[01:27:50.980 --> 01:27:54.740]  silver but silver is the best investment of all because it's a consumable
[01:27:54.740 --> 01:27:58.460]  precious metal whereas gold is horrid for the first time in the history of the
[01:27:58.460 --> 01:28:03.820]  world there is more gold than silver on planet earth so silver is a bargain
[01:28:03.820 --> 01:28:07.340]  even at 25 bucks and I hear that's right Ron tell me I don't have any money I
[01:28:07.340 --> 01:28:11.340]  said Jesus you're not 25 bucks you don't have that you're in big trouble well
[01:28:11.340 --> 01:28:14.420]  what silver was five and a half six dollars ten years ago it should look
[01:28:14.420 --> 01:28:17.740]  almost 25 an ounce right now I'd say that's a pretty good investment in
[01:28:17.740 --> 01:28:21.980]  anybody anybody could start buying one silver dollar a month I mean come on
[01:28:21.980 --> 01:28:27.140]  yes exactly right and I think silver is the biggest sleeper of all I've been
[01:28:27.140 --> 01:28:30.940]  saying this for years and you know everybody watches gold I have lots of
[01:28:30.940 --> 01:28:35.380]  gold I have a gold mine in China silver mine in South America but silver
[01:28:35.380 --> 01:28:40.580]  because I'm in the I'm in the industry I understand who buys my sober it's
[01:28:40.580 --> 01:28:44.580]  industry that's right it's used in in in manufacturing you name it water
[01:28:44.580 --> 01:28:49.820]  purification electronics every computer every cell phone and correct me if I'm
[01:28:49.820 --> 01:28:54.060]  wrong but I've read a lot of numbers and statistics in reports that the other
[01:28:54.060 --> 01:28:57.420]  now selling more gold than they are mining each year for the first time but
[01:28:57.420 --> 01:29:01.460]  it's even worse with silver that they can't find the silver they need to
[01:29:01.460 --> 01:29:06.620]  supply you're exactly correct and I'm in the industry I can tell you that wow
[01:29:06.620 --> 01:29:10.540]  we'll start getting into that that's really interesting well it again it's
[01:29:10.540 --> 01:29:14.940]  really simple you don't have to go to college for this silver is consumed silver
[01:29:14.940 --> 01:29:20.580]  is like oil you know it's burned up he doesn't come back so silver is being
[01:29:20.580 --> 01:29:25.100]  burned up at higher speeds and the more we shift to the information age you know
[01:29:25.100 --> 01:29:29.740]  the more high pads that Apple comes up with that it's like lithium in Afghanistan
[01:29:29.740 --> 01:29:37.300]  we know why we're there lithium mines I'm sure Robert you know so you'll
[01:29:37.300 --> 01:29:40.140]  probably be in that we're gonna come back long segment coming up sorry about
[01:29:40.140 --> 01:29:44.900]  that break we got to go to it let's get into why they told us don't buy gold and
[01:29:44.900 --> 01:29:48.100]  silver I mean they knew the rich were in there buying it they wanted it for
[01:29:48.100 --> 01:29:55.220]  themselves we'll be right back we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex

[01:33:34.020 --> 01:33:40.900]  best-selling author researcher investor businessman self-help he is our guest we
[01:33:40.900 --> 01:33:45.700]  got about the 25 minutes left with him rich dad.com's the website Robert a
[01:33:45.700 --> 01:33:50.900]  continuing with gold and silver starting out a few decades ago there in your
[01:33:50.900 --> 01:33:55.500]  little bungalow in Hawaii now to owning you know a major oil drilling
[01:33:55.500 --> 01:34:01.340]  operations goldmine silver mine 4,000 plus apartment units and you know how
[01:34:01.340 --> 01:34:05.620]  to basically use the tax system they've written for the elite where you pay
[01:34:05.620 --> 01:34:10.820]  almost no taxes yes it's a matter of financial education you know I mean
[01:34:10.820 --> 01:34:15.700]  some guys are hiding running into the hills and joining different you know
[01:34:15.700 --> 01:34:19.860]  resistance groups I just decided to become a capitalist and play by the
[01:34:19.860 --> 01:34:24.940]  same rules they were playing because I fought in Vietnam twice for capitalism
[01:34:24.940 --> 01:34:30.100]  I didn't fight for fascism which we have right now or socialism you know this
[01:34:30.100 --> 01:34:33.660]  idea of Robin Hood you know you take from the rich and you give to the poor just
[01:34:33.660 --> 01:34:37.940]  creates more poor people but that's what our school system teaches them they
[01:34:37.940 --> 01:34:42.660]  want surf so you they want to give a man fish not teach him how to fish yes and
[01:34:42.660 --> 01:34:46.980]  we just creating we just mass producing mass manufacturing poor people where do
[01:34:46.980 --> 01:34:51.820]  you see a national education is cool does not you know it's not that works where
[01:34:51.820 --> 01:34:56.140]  do you see gold and silver going well I got back I caution people in gold and
[01:34:56.140 --> 01:35:01.060]  silver because you know I started when gold was around 265 an ounce and I
[01:35:01.060 --> 01:35:06.940]  tracked it I was in gold and silver at 85 back in the 70 so I want you to go up
[01:35:06.940 --> 01:35:10.580]  and down and I think they've got to watch out for his interest rates if if the
[01:35:10.580 --> 01:35:14.380]  skyburn act he gets desperate here he jacks interest rates let's say the 10%
[01:35:14.380 --> 01:35:19.380]  gold and silver crash so you really just don't buy gold and silver you've got to
[01:35:19.380 --> 01:35:24.100]  understand the dynamics that causes prices to go up or down but they're
[01:35:24.100 --> 01:35:26.860]  signaling they're going to continue with the lower interest rates and they're
[01:35:26.860 --> 01:35:30.340]  going to hyperinflate the currency that would that would be a major indicator of
[01:35:30.340 --> 01:35:34.260]  it going up it would be but I don't trust them I don't you know how do you tell
[01:35:34.260 --> 01:35:37.500]  when they're lying with their lips are moving so people got to be ready to dump
[01:35:37.500 --> 01:35:41.500]  their gold and silver if the indicators come out no it's not that I think I think
[01:35:41.500 --> 01:35:46.940]  you and I are holding gold and silver at very very good price but I I think what
[01:35:46.940 --> 01:35:50.860]  I'm concerned about is the guys that come in with a gold let's say passing
[01:35:50.860 --> 01:35:55.140]  3,000 they're the ones who are going to take the hand I tend to agree that's what
[01:35:55.140 --> 01:36:00.300]  I tell listeners just for my gut is that if inflation to 1980s 2500 an ounce I'm
[01:36:00.300 --> 01:36:04.260]  going to start getting real nervous when it gets up there yes 25 is I think I
[01:36:04.260 --> 01:36:07.940]  think you're pretty accurate on that it's time to start pulling in your horns
[01:36:07.940 --> 01:36:12.420]  and look at something else like right now I'm actually pulling in my horns on
[01:36:12.420 --> 01:36:18.020]  gold once it passed 1100 is a little too rich for me I still bought silver but
[01:36:18.020 --> 01:36:22.180]  now I'm investing in my solar company so because I think they all look like you
[01:36:22.180 --> 01:36:25.700]  guys are saying that's the way it's going to go so that's where I mean that
[01:36:25.700 --> 01:36:30.380]  so you basically look at the trends and had your bets throughout the trends and
[01:36:30.380 --> 01:36:34.300]  don't just plump your money down in a bank getting almost zero percent that's
[01:36:34.300 --> 01:36:38.700]  correct and the thing I watch for I mean my father my poor dad was a politician
[01:36:38.700 --> 01:36:45.300]  I don't trust those guys I love my dad but they don't know Jack there is no
[01:36:45.300 --> 01:36:50.340]  correlation between politics and business well wisdom today he is buying
[01:36:50.340 --> 01:36:54.740]  into whatever the establishment says and they're there to fleece you right and
[01:36:54.740 --> 01:36:59.460]  the reason I want to be on your show show is because of info wars I have wars I
[01:36:59.460 --> 01:37:05.540]  agree 100% they want to control what you hear and what you think and they will
[01:37:05.540 --> 01:37:09.620]  censor you know there's no censorship bunch of bull you will be censored in
[01:37:09.620 --> 01:37:15.500]  this country so that's the thing I'm saying you got to understand that you
[01:37:15.500 --> 01:37:19.700]  have to be smarter you know what I'm terrified of right now there's going to
[01:37:19.700 --> 01:37:23.500]  be what they call you know when it goes parabolic when gold passes three thousand
[01:37:23.500 --> 01:37:28.980]  and everybody will roll in there and then they're gonna get suckered out again
[01:37:28.980 --> 01:37:34.860]  happens every time after the real thing well welcome that's what my gut tells me
[01:37:34.860 --> 01:37:39.340]  is when to get out of the bubble at the right time yeah but also it's not so much
[01:37:39.340 --> 01:37:44.660]  when you get out it's when you get in and getting in is when your profits are
[01:37:44.660 --> 01:37:49.060]  made when you buy and so you look all the suckers right now whatever you know
[01:37:49.060 --> 01:37:54.220]  it's the same thing I see all these guys we buy gold we buy gold we buy you know
[01:37:54.220 --> 01:38:02.100]  turn it in you know the bubbles coming and all the suckers will roll into the
[01:38:02.100 --> 01:38:07.900]  market well when you've got two percent of the population in gold and they're
[01:38:07.900 --> 01:38:11.500]  talking about maybe ten percent in the next two years yeah that's when you know
[01:38:11.500 --> 01:38:17.020]  there's a serious situation but I think I think there's a long time and this is
[01:38:17.020 --> 01:38:22.420]  my personal view until they do try to deflate the bubble yeah and that's why
[01:38:22.420 --> 01:38:28.860]  you know gold at 13 gold at 15 gold at 2 I would say not a bad buy but I'd be
[01:38:28.860 --> 01:38:33.300]  very cautious because desperate people do desperate things I mean you saw what
[01:38:33.300 --> 01:38:37.260]  Bernanke said a few days ago he says I don't understand the price movement in
[01:38:37.260 --> 01:38:44.340]  gold Bernanke you look I printed that stuff we can also see wild gyrations up
[01:38:44.340 --> 01:38:48.460]  and down before it's all over yeah so we could see a false popping in the bubble
[01:38:48.460 --> 01:38:53.140]  I have lots of gold and lots of silver I'm just cautioning you know I agree don't
[01:38:53.140 --> 01:38:59.740]  come in late I agree Robert you talk about info wars you talk about how we're
[01:38:59.740 --> 01:39:02.700]  being lied to when we look at this military industrial complex owned by
[01:39:02.700 --> 01:39:06.500]  the big mega six banks they're now openly saying that they're gonna start
[01:39:06.500 --> 01:39:10.140]  taking pension funds and taxing and we talked about that so desperate people do
[01:39:10.140 --> 01:39:15.380]  do desperate things at your bottom line looking into your crystal ball where do
[01:39:15.380 --> 01:39:18.380]  you see society I mean you see this recession depression getting worse
[01:39:18.380 --> 01:39:22.020]  where do you see this going well it's all relative you know I mean the other
[01:39:22.020 --> 01:39:27.180]  old saying if your neighbor loses a job it's in a recession if you lose your
[01:39:27.180 --> 01:39:30.820]  job you're in a depression mm-hmm another part more rich dad where I
[01:39:30.820 --> 01:39:36.020]  personally stand from if you understand the rules of the rich it's a really a
[01:39:36.020 --> 01:39:40.060]  good time to get rich you know I'm not saying being poor is bad I just don't
[01:39:40.060 --> 01:39:45.140]  look good in poor clothing yeah there's ways to make money and in any market
[01:39:45.140 --> 01:39:48.500]  yeah so if you sit in there listening to what your mommy and daddy told you you
[01:39:48.500 --> 01:39:51.860]  know it was go to school and get a job work hard save money by a house that's
[01:39:51.860 --> 01:39:56.660]  an asset and give your money to the to Wall Street through a 401k you're
[01:39:56.660 --> 01:40:03.420]  probably gonna get pleased well Robert we're being pleased we're honored to
[01:40:03.420 --> 01:40:05.780]  have you here today and I've got a bunch of other questions I want to throw you
[01:40:05.780 --> 01:40:10.380]  in rapid succession but what was the main what's the main knowledge you want
[01:40:10.380 --> 01:40:16.060]  to impart to our listeners I mean well basically you have to understand the
[01:40:16.060 --> 01:40:19.580]  rules of the rich I'm not saying they're good or bad a lot of greedy poor
[01:40:19.580 --> 01:40:23.060]  people a lot of greedy rich people but the smarter you are you don't become a
[01:40:23.060 --> 01:40:27.860]  victim to it I mean you need to take control exactly what Alex Jones is
[01:40:27.860 --> 01:40:32.740]  saying you need to take control of what you put inside your head you know if you
[01:40:32.740 --> 01:40:37.540]  don't control that you're screwed you've got to take control of what you put
[01:40:37.540 --> 01:40:41.420]  into your head so if you listen to those garbage the school system puts out
[01:40:41.420 --> 01:40:45.820]  politicians put out at Wall Street puts out and banks put out you're gonna you
[01:40:45.820 --> 01:40:50.180]  don't get hammered I've seen breakdowns of the average CNBC host with their
[01:40:50.180 --> 01:40:55.500]  predictions they're wrong over 87% of the time somebody like yourself and and
[01:40:55.500 --> 01:40:59.500]  others we have on our right more than 90% of the time but but it's not that a lot
[01:40:59.500 --> 01:41:03.220]  of those pundits are stupid there they're selling a fraud they know what
[01:41:03.220 --> 01:41:08.020]  they're doing they have to say what they say if they say what I said or what you
[01:41:08.020 --> 01:41:13.140]  said they'd be fired it's that simple I mean they're not bad people that's kind
[01:41:13.140 --> 01:41:17.380]  of what I'm putting out there we're not bad people we're just we haven't taken
[01:41:17.380 --> 01:41:22.180]  control of the information in our brain and there is that lie of advertising
[01:41:22.180 --> 01:41:26.020]  that perceptions reality we'll know if you stumble off a thousand foot cliff
[01:41:26.020 --> 01:41:29.500]  and you think there's water at the bottom and and there isn't your perception
[01:41:29.500 --> 01:41:33.460]  that you saw water at the bottom isn't isn't going to save you no I'm not
[01:41:33.460 --> 01:41:37.420]  just reading this little was from smart money magazine those but those guys
[01:41:37.420 --> 01:41:42.700]  really hate me but anyway they had this poor guy is 58 years old he says I
[01:41:42.700 --> 01:41:47.020]  don't have a pension what should I do they said save money and get a 401k I
[01:41:47.020 --> 01:41:51.500]  mean it's the same dogma from the guys that brought you this financial crisis
[01:41:51.500 --> 01:41:56.300]  oh they're now saying give them more power over the entire world financial
[01:41:56.300 --> 01:42:01.100]  system and they'll save us yes exactly I mean that's like you've got to take
[01:42:01.100 --> 01:42:05.980]  control of what you put in your head let's talk about your your overall view
[01:42:05.980 --> 01:42:10.020]  of politics and in the direction the world's going there there's a large
[01:42:10.020 --> 01:42:14.500]  awakening happening correct me of your if you disagree speak about that but
[01:42:14.500 --> 01:42:18.780]  also things like other lies like like what do you think of government-sponsored
[01:42:18.780 --> 01:42:22.340]  terrorism what do you think of the Gulf of Tonkin being staged to get us into
[01:42:22.340 --> 01:42:25.940]  Vietnam War what's your view on some of the rabbits they may pull out of their
[01:42:25.940 --> 01:42:31.140]  hat I don't I wouldn't put it past any of them that's that's all I don't know
[01:42:31.140 --> 01:42:35.900]  they're true or not true I you know like I always say to people take care of my
[01:42:35.900 --> 01:42:40.020]  thing God helps those who help themselves I help myself and I watch what
[01:42:40.020 --> 01:42:45.900]  they say I always know the self-interest it was always self-interest so so I just
[01:42:45.900 --> 01:42:51.260]  watch am I why are we in Iraq and Afghanistan you know I don't understand
[01:42:51.260 --> 01:42:54.820]  that and when I say that a lot of times as well you're not patriotic I say hey
[01:42:54.820 --> 01:42:59.700]  moron I went to Vietnam twice what did you do you know I've seen war ocean
[01:42:59.700 --> 01:43:04.580]  Clinton never saw war and that's why they sent him well it's not patriotic to be
[01:43:04.580 --> 01:43:10.940]  used to expand a corporate empire and and and and to kill a million Iraqis yep
[01:43:10.940 --> 01:43:18.140]  all in the name of what I don't know but I you know you and I on the same page
[01:43:18.140 --> 01:43:22.100]  you got to take control of what you put in your head you know what I don't like
[01:43:22.100 --> 01:43:26.700]  about school is I didn't really have much choice of what I could learn you know
[01:43:26.700 --> 01:43:31.580]  it's kind of government sanctioned propaganda so you know I was in my third
[01:43:31.580 --> 01:43:35.620]  year of calculus I'm nearly flunking out they go when am I ever gonna use this
[01:43:35.620 --> 01:43:40.340]  stuff when am I gonna use calculus the teachers that I don't know so that why
[01:43:40.340 --> 01:43:47.740]  am I studying well there's a war on for our minds that's our slogan exactly and
[01:43:47.740 --> 01:43:53.820]  that's why there's a war but you are ultimately the person that decides yeah
[01:43:53.820 --> 01:43:56.580]  I think about the general public who are starting to wake up a little bit but
[01:43:56.580 --> 01:44:01.620]  they still have no clue how deep this almost hologram of disinformation is
[01:44:01.620 --> 01:44:06.180]  that's projected into society and then we repeat the disinfo and that gives it
[01:44:06.180 --> 01:44:10.660]  that tangible reality but it's not reality yeah well let me ask you this what
[01:44:10.660 --> 01:44:16.660]  do you think if the Fed like right now we're at about 96% debt to GDP you know
[01:44:16.660 --> 01:44:20.580]  I mean we have and with the biggest debtor nation in the world what do you
[01:44:20.580 --> 01:44:27.020]  think is going to happen if they print more money it is going to hyper-inflate
[01:44:27.020 --> 01:44:32.380]  the currency drive-up prices but then the new debts and fractional reserve
[01:44:32.380 --> 01:44:36.620]  banking calculations that are made will be made in the new denomination and value
[01:44:36.620 --> 01:44:42.260]  and so we'll just stay in debt and actually get into worse debt so well
[01:44:42.260 --> 01:44:46.140]  what kind of action are you taking so that's really that's what they'll
[01:44:46.140 --> 01:44:49.860]  probably do and I think what you're saying what I'm saying it's not so much
[01:44:49.860 --> 01:44:53.900]  what they're gonna do is what are you and I gonna do well I know what I'm doing
[01:44:53.900 --> 01:44:56.820]  my main mission is just to wake people up so they know they're how they're
[01:44:56.820 --> 01:45:00.460]  being hammered because the big central banks have openly stated their plan it
[01:45:00.460 --> 01:45:07.220]  was to engineer all this collapse society and then use the social unrest as a
[01:45:07.220 --> 01:45:11.860]  pretext to swing around the homeland security grid on the American people and
[01:45:11.860 --> 01:45:16.500]  that's already now coming from behind the curtain into plain view and so I'm
[01:45:16.500 --> 01:45:21.300]  simply pouring almost all of our assets into this information warfare
[01:45:21.300 --> 01:45:26.420]  operation to counter the system so I guess I'm kind of like a for lack of a
[01:45:26.420 --> 01:45:30.860]  better term you know kind of like flying my information warfare plane you know
[01:45:30.860 --> 01:45:34.860]  into the deck of their biggest capital ship just trying to get people to
[01:45:34.860 --> 01:45:38.700]  realize what's happening and we've got emergency backup to find the operation
[01:45:38.700 --> 01:45:43.780]  with gold and silver investments I'm trying to intensify the amount of films
[01:45:43.780 --> 01:45:49.700]  and and material I'm putting out but that's basically it as outstanding thank
[01:45:49.700 --> 01:45:53.660]  you for doing that because that's really what it's gonna take is that somebody
[01:45:53.660 --> 01:45:59.220]  has to stand up and the more people stand up and wake up the less power the
[01:45:59.220 --> 01:46:06.100]  opposition has well what I do is rich dad is I explain how the rich play the
[01:46:06.100 --> 01:46:12.180]  game and that way I have a choice of games I just you know I wouldn't send my
[01:46:12.180 --> 01:46:16.100]  kid to school to get a job because you're just being programmed to be
[01:46:16.100 --> 01:46:21.420]  proletariat working class I'd rather have my kid learn to be a capitalist you
[01:46:21.420 --> 01:46:24.540]  know and that's what I fought for that's why that's all I'm saying I fought to
[01:46:24.540 --> 01:46:29.780]  capitalism and we have a bunch of fascist Nazis running the show they're
[01:46:29.780 --> 01:46:37.420]  not even socialists yeah socialism's bad enough but at least theoretically some
[01:46:37.420 --> 01:46:42.220]  of the stolen loot gets to somebody but here it just all goes offshore to these
[01:46:42.220 --> 01:46:46.300]  people and they just get away with more and more I mean it's scary to know
[01:46:46.300 --> 01:46:50.460]  there's this much hubris in the ruling class well what's what frightens me is
[01:46:50.460 --> 01:46:54.820]  when the government has that much when I fear my own government that's not a
[01:46:54.820 --> 01:46:59.820]  good sign tell us about the most important books people can order from
[01:46:59.820 --> 01:47:02.940]  rich dad calm and what your latest book covers you talk about an unfair
[01:47:02.940 --> 01:47:07.860]  advantage the conspiracy of the rich the eight the eight new rules of money I
[01:47:07.860 --> 01:47:11.100]  talk about that well conspiracy with their rich was the last book and that's
[01:47:11.100 --> 01:47:16.100]  it explains a lot of people already know it's how the fed started you know the
[01:47:16.100 --> 01:47:20.300]  Brent woods but why we don't have a big section of this why there's no financial
[01:47:20.300 --> 01:47:25.220]  education at school so that goes back to 1904 with John D. Rockefeller and the
[01:47:25.220 --> 01:47:29.180]  General Education Board and at that point they took all financial education
[01:47:29.180 --> 01:47:33.780]  out of the school system and that way they could program people to work for
[01:47:33.780 --> 01:47:38.420]  the rich and our school system the NEA and all those guys they're quite happy to
[01:47:38.420 --> 01:47:42.300]  have them controlling the education system and they take the money out of
[01:47:42.300 --> 01:47:45.980]  your paycheck for most Americans so you don't even really notice how much
[01:47:45.980 --> 01:47:49.940]  they're grabbing right that was a 1943 is called the current tax payment act
[01:47:49.940 --> 01:47:55.660]  in 86 was that the 86 tax reform act which then got doctors and lawyers so
[01:47:55.660 --> 01:47:59.540]  today doctors and lawyers or the self-employed or small business pay the
[01:47:59.540 --> 01:48:06.460]  highest tax as possible now when you look at May I paid zero tax yeah as
[01:48:06.460 --> 01:48:10.820]  England goes so goes the rest of the the world with all this tyranny have you
[01:48:10.820 --> 01:48:14.300]  have you noticed in the last month the government's announced that all paychecks
[01:48:14.300 --> 01:48:17.300]  will now be deposited with the government first and then they will pay you
[01:48:17.300 --> 01:48:20.940]  digitally to your bank account what they wish they really want to get us on
[01:48:20.940 --> 01:48:26.700]  this cashless system so they can really target the entire black market economy
[01:48:26.700 --> 01:48:30.780]  and shut it down I haven't heard that but that's why it's not socialism it's
[01:48:30.780 --> 01:48:36.420]  fascism when you fear your own government we have a problem we have a
[01:48:36.420 --> 01:48:40.460]  very big problem and what I was saying is for the last break there's no
[01:48:40.460 --> 01:48:44.420]  correlation between government and business there are two different worlds
[01:48:44.420 --> 01:48:49.260]  that's why Obama has less than 7% of his staff with any real-world business
[01:48:49.260 --> 01:48:54.420]  experience they don't know anything else but to help themselves by taking our
[01:48:54.420 --> 01:48:58.180]  money what political advice would you give in the states rights movement
[01:48:58.180 --> 01:49:02.020]  taking back control of Washington I see that as the best round I mean what
[01:49:02.020 --> 01:49:06.220]  politically you know talking to 2 million activists right now people that
[01:49:06.220 --> 01:49:11.700]  are really taking action Robert what would you what are your best ideas for
[01:49:11.700 --> 01:49:17.540]  for for blocking this this fascist cartel well the best way is take care
[01:49:17.540 --> 01:49:20.980]  yourself you know everybody wants to change the government which is almost
[01:49:20.980 --> 01:49:25.100]  fundamentally impossible there's too many people making too much money with
[01:49:25.100 --> 01:49:30.060]  exactly the way it is Wall Street and Goldman Sachs being one of them but I
[01:49:30.060 --> 01:49:34.500]  can change me and what you've been hearing me say is that I play by the
[01:49:34.500 --> 01:49:38.820]  rules of the rich but if you don't know what those rules are you're in trouble
[01:49:38.820 --> 01:49:42.340]  the conspiracy of the rich is where it kind of starts and this is the first I
[01:49:42.340 --> 01:49:47.020]  know my publicist and released it but my next book an unfair advantage the power
[01:49:47.020 --> 01:49:51.540]  of financial education goes into how debt and taxes make guy like guys like me
[01:49:51.540 --> 01:49:55.420]  rich but our school system will never teach you that because they don't want
[01:49:55.420 --> 01:50:00.100]  you to know that so I just explained the rules of the rich I didn't watch out
[01:50:00.100 --> 01:50:05.420]  for myself and that way and I make a lot of people rich and all this but if I
[01:50:05.420 --> 01:50:09.940]  don't take care of myself I can't save anybody else so that's kind of my
[01:50:09.940 --> 01:50:14.900]  ground I my father was a political animal he ran for governor of the state
[01:50:14.900 --> 01:50:19.940]  of Hawaii you know and that was the most horrifying ugly thing I'd ever seen in
[01:50:19.940 --> 01:50:24.220]  my whole life so I don't have any faith in the two-party system I don't have any
[01:50:24.220 --> 01:50:28.180]  faith in government because as you and I know the Fed and the central banks
[01:50:28.180 --> 01:50:32.380]  control the world there was a Washington Times article about the only city in the
[01:50:32.380 --> 01:50:37.740]  nation to becoming even richer and expanding and jobs is DC the cancer is
[01:50:37.740 --> 01:50:41.980]  growing yes and that's what that's why I'm not political you know I would just
[01:50:41.980 --> 01:50:47.940]  rather be an independent like a coyote you're running around the place well
[01:50:47.940 --> 01:50:50.900]  certainly for you individually that's good and it's wonderful to see people
[01:50:50.900 --> 01:50:55.820]  to be rugged individualists like you are Robert but they're just adding more and
[01:50:55.820 --> 01:50:59.420]  more taxes more and more controls more and more selective enforcement I see
[01:50:59.420 --> 01:51:02.780]  this down the road or they're going to start trying to selectively change rules
[01:51:02.780 --> 01:51:08.420]  or selectively enforce them to try to shut down the cowboys like yourself yeah
[01:51:08.420 --> 01:51:11.960]  but they can't afford to that see you understand the really the rules they
[01:51:11.960 --> 01:51:17.540]  have to shut themselves down in my best defense is to play on their side so you
[01:51:17.540 --> 01:51:22.740]  know the inside baseball rules you basically are with the owners of the
[01:51:22.740 --> 01:51:27.260]  casino because you know their blueprints so you're safe yes and that's what
[01:51:27.260 --> 01:51:32.220]  Rich dad stands for I just teach you there's two sides to a point and these
[01:51:32.220 --> 01:51:35.380]  people who are sending their kids to school the biggest communist thing I've
[01:51:35.380 --> 01:51:39.780]  ever seen you know the kids just get brainwashed there and they don't know
[01:51:39.780 --> 01:51:43.580]  learn anything about money I'm not against education I'm against brainwashing
[01:51:43.580 --> 01:51:48.380]  they just turn their children over to the system that's correct where they
[01:51:48.380 --> 01:51:52.980]  train the kids to tattle on you to spy on you that the environment's dying have
[01:51:52.980 --> 01:51:56.860]  you seen the TV ad they're running in England where the school teacher asked
[01:51:56.860 --> 01:52:00.660]  the you know like sixth graders what will you do for the environment and when
[01:52:00.660 --> 01:52:09.300]  some of the kids say I'll do nothing she murders them no anyway you know I mean
[01:52:09.300 --> 01:52:12.740]  that sounds crazy but that was put up by the 1010 project I promise you it's
[01:52:12.740 --> 01:52:16.180]  called it's called splattergate just Google it guys as you find the London
[01:52:16.180 --> 01:52:23.260]  Guardian article about government to take British paychecks okay yeah there it
[01:52:23.260 --> 01:52:26.220]  is on the headline British government to seize all paychecks what do you think
[01:52:26.220 --> 01:52:30.780]  of that Robert well it doesn't surprise me like I said this is it goes on in our
[01:52:30.780 --> 01:52:36.780]  country to 1943 current tax payment at 86 tax reform act just understand that my
[01:52:36.780 --> 01:52:40.620]  new book was coming out is called an unfair advantage it may be out in a
[01:52:40.620 --> 01:52:45.060]  month or two months the first has been announced but in there I'll I explain
[01:52:45.060 --> 01:52:50.340]  how the taxes and debt make me rich you have to know how to use debt and you
[01:52:50.340 --> 01:52:55.260]  have to know how to use taxes in your favor but to try and change this rule
[01:52:55.260 --> 01:53:00.340]  I don't put much faith in it they're going to always take from the poor and
[01:53:00.340 --> 01:53:05.260]  give to the rich that's what that's what's going on and I'd rather just be
[01:53:05.260 --> 01:53:08.740]  rich and not be part of the poor and they've got the so many of the poor
[01:53:08.740 --> 01:53:12.980]  tricked into thinking they lobby government yes to protect them from the
[01:53:12.980 --> 01:53:19.260]  ultra-rich yeah the ultra-rich finance the government yes yes that's why when
[01:53:19.260 --> 01:53:23.700]  they repealed like a McCain fine goal I knew it was all over see what McCain and
[01:53:23.700 --> 01:53:27.060]  fine goal we're trying to do was limit campaign contributions well that was
[01:53:27.060 --> 01:53:31.540]  thrown out the window so now when people think was one man one vote that's not
[01:53:31.540 --> 01:53:39.420]  true it really is one million dollars one vote I'm not telling anybody anything
[01:53:39.420 --> 01:53:44.940]  new the rich always control it so I just chose when I came back in 1973 from
[01:53:44.940 --> 01:53:48.820]  Vietnam I said I'm just gonna be on the rich side I don't want to be like my
[01:53:48.820 --> 01:53:52.860]  poor dad a school teacher fighting the system you have no power when you have
[01:53:52.860 --> 01:53:57.500]  no money you have no power when the taxes are just eating you alive okay well
[01:53:57.500 --> 01:54:03.100]  let's say we got a 71 year old person who's got a million dollars in their
[01:54:03.100 --> 01:54:08.500]  retirement fund what would you do with that million dollars I buy real but I'm
[01:54:08.500 --> 01:54:13.820]  not you can't do that because you know I've been trained for all these years
[01:54:13.820 --> 01:54:16.740]  yeah that's the problem because you've got to have the specific knowledge not
[01:54:16.740 --> 01:54:19.860]  just the money exactly and that's why I said again 1973 I started taking real
[01:54:19.860 --> 01:54:23.060]  estate courses not because of real estate but I have to learn to manage
[01:54:23.060 --> 01:54:26.540]  yeah knowledge is power and so even the people have money if they don't have the
[01:54:26.540 --> 01:54:30.660]  knowledge or the time to implement it they can't do it but you have studiously
[01:54:30.660 --> 01:54:36.620]  built and built and built until now I mean I mean I mean how much is your total
[01:54:36.620 --> 01:54:41.220]  empire worth ballpark I don't know but I made more than two million a month
[01:54:41.220 --> 01:54:47.140]  without working tax-free so it's not a lot of money I'm not Donald Trump or
[01:54:47.140 --> 01:54:51.940]  stuff like that but two million a month tax-free is pretty good well not to
[01:54:51.940 --> 01:54:56.500]  mention your books yeah that's not that's not including my books or anything
[01:54:56.500 --> 01:55:01.740]  else that's just from income from my real estate my investments but 26 million
[01:55:01.740 --> 01:55:07.860]  plus copies of books yeah I just wrote those books after I was already rich no
[01:55:07.860 --> 01:55:10.420]  I understand that trying to impart that and that's really something
[01:55:10.420 --> 01:55:14.740]  revolutionary you've done that's really contributed to people understanding
[01:55:14.740 --> 01:55:17.980]  what's happening and I've seen these success stories of people that have put
[01:55:17.980 --> 01:55:21.820]  your system into motion they have become fabulously wealthy as well what's not
[01:55:21.820 --> 01:55:26.660]  so much wealthy is they now have control over their lives you see if you learn the
[01:55:26.660 --> 01:55:33.820]  rules of the rich which is get in debt you will get richer you see as knowledge
[01:55:33.820 --> 01:55:39.700]  is power but misinformation is damaging and so all of these guys who are trying
[01:55:39.700 --> 01:55:43.940]  to you know save their house and save money for their retirement and all this
[01:55:43.940 --> 01:55:48.940]  I think that's good if you have no information but yeah if you want to beat
[01:55:48.940 --> 01:55:52.540]  the system you got to get smart I saw an article in the Wall Street Journal a
[01:55:52.540 --> 01:55:55.740]  few months ago where they admitted that it's the people worth over ten million
[01:55:55.740 --> 01:55:59.540]  dollars they're the first to walk away from a house that's upside down but
[01:55:59.540 --> 01:56:02.860]  then a blue collar person they'll go down with the ship yes but that's
[01:56:02.860 --> 01:56:06.820]  changing right now because I was at my local Italian restaurant that the three
[01:56:06.820 --> 01:56:11.580]  cooks came out and said hey can we ask a question I said yes we we haven't paid
[01:56:11.580 --> 01:56:16.220]  our mortgage in 18 months and I said why'd you stop you said because the
[01:56:16.220 --> 01:56:21.220]  mortgage was greater than our house I said well you're pretty smart
[01:56:22.220 --> 01:56:28.900]  I said you're so far behind you're not my head amazing Robert thank you so much
[01:56:28.900 --> 01:56:31.700]  for spending time with us I hope that you'll come back with us in the future
[01:56:31.700 --> 01:56:34.860]  and I'm I'm a flatter that you're aware of the show and the work we do here now
[01:56:34.860 --> 01:56:37.100]  I've heard a lot of good things about you I heard you're causing a lot of
[01:56:37.100 --> 01:56:40.700]  trouble so that's why I had to call up well sir hopefully we can have you on
[01:56:40.700 --> 01:56:44.620]  every few months and and and really get into you know in depth on the important

[01:56:47.340 --> 01:56:53.340]  Robert Kiyosaki just amazing interview there this hour is almost over and I
[01:56:53.340 --> 01:56:56.740]  tend to agree with Robert I mean I think when gold goes above 25 right now
[01:56:56.740 --> 01:57:00.020]  that's when it becomes a bubble and dangerous but I do agree with him I have
[01:57:00.020 --> 01:57:02.940]  so many people who don't have a lot of money ask me where do I get in well you
[01:57:02.940 --> 01:57:06.540]  get in with silver dollars and silver half dollars and I have the man on the
[01:57:06.540 --> 01:57:10.060]  phone who months and months ago bought silver when it was two three dollars

[01:58:51.940 --> 01:58:55.700]  five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator number
[01:58:55.700 --> 01:58:59.460]  one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill
[01:58:59.460 --> 01:59:03.980]  number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric

[01:59:08.220 --> 01:59:12.820]  in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the
[01:59:12.820 --> 01:59:16.820]  country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist
[01:59:16.820 --> 01:59:21.180]  legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is
[01:59:21.180 --> 01:59:24.900]  always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their
[01:59:24.900 --> 01:59:29.060]  power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator provides

[02:01:31.620 --> 02:01:36.060]  did they boy that's one of the worst showings of a Texas football team that I
[02:01:36.060 --> 02:01:41.220]  can recall in my memory you know especially at home you know you guys are
[02:01:41.220 --> 02:01:45.940]  usually unbeatable in Austin or Dallas as the case was where did you end up
[02:01:45.940 --> 02:01:51.340]  playing them well I forgot to mention you did XFL and NFL didn't you yeah I
[02:01:51.340 --> 02:01:55.740]  did I did three years of the National Football League got to a Tampa Bay
[02:01:55.740 --> 02:02:00.860]  radio and one with the Vikings and then I did one year that the XFL existed
[02:02:00.860 --> 02:02:06.540]  well football you know it's just played at different levels by the
[02:02:06.540 --> 02:02:10.980]  professionals that do do it and but it's still the same game whether you're
[02:02:10.980 --> 02:02:15.380]  playing at that junior higher high school or all the way to the pros when we
[02:02:15.380 --> 02:02:20.100]  were down in New Orleans after we were done doing our investigation I had to
[02:02:20.100 --> 02:02:23.420]  fly out the next morning you were there for a few more days to continue your
[02:02:23.420 --> 02:02:27.380]  investigation did you ever get a chance to go to that Vikings and Saints game
[02:02:27.380 --> 02:02:32.980]  well I had the opportunity to go but unfortunately the show came first and we
[02:02:32.980 --> 02:02:37.700]  had gone out that day way out to the tip of the golf which is a few hours drive
[02:02:37.700 --> 02:02:42.260]  from New Orleans and unfortunately I didn't get back until they were actually
[02:02:42.260 --> 02:02:47.500]  kicking it off and you know you shot with us in the heat down there I was
[02:02:47.500 --> 02:02:52.060]  pretty exhausted so I took the easy way out I just went up to my hotel room and
[02:02:52.060 --> 02:02:56.540]  watched it on TV well gov a lot is happening we're gonna get a break in a
[02:02:56.540 --> 02:02:59.860]  moment but I want to get into the show I mean obviously I've been a consultant
[02:02:59.860 --> 02:03:02.980]  and I appear in quite a few of the episodes that are coming up but I have
[02:03:02.980 --> 02:03:09.300]  to say in the last season was shocking and informative from what I've seen it
[02:03:09.300 --> 02:03:13.580]  looks like this one's shaping up to even be more hardcore I think so I think it's
[02:03:13.580 --> 02:03:18.860]  about the topics are even if I can I don't know how you say they're better you
[02:03:18.860 --> 02:03:24.700]  know the more exciting even and the other thing on the production and on our
[02:03:24.700 --> 02:03:29.380]  end of it any time you go from your first season to your second season you're
[02:03:29.380 --> 02:03:34.660]  going to iron out some of the rough edges you're going to do better on you
[02:03:34.660 --> 02:03:39.300]  know the focus of what you're trying to accomplish and so a second season there's
[02:03:39.300 --> 02:03:42.900]  always the first season to do in a show like this you kind of fly by the seat
[02:03:42.900 --> 02:03:47.980]  of your pants now the second season you have a good idea of what works and what
[02:03:47.980 --> 02:03:52.500]  doesn't work and how to go about getting the information we need to get so I
[02:03:52.500 --> 02:03:57.020]  think it's always a work in progress and hopefully I was an improved work in
[02:03:57.020 --> 02:04:04.700]  progress when we come back we'll get into as many of the episodes as we can and
[02:04:04.700 --> 02:04:09.780]  and squeeze as much info as we can out of you governor but a quick question what's
[02:04:09.780 --> 02:04:18.340]  your favorite episode right now because that's the one that you know had my
[02:04:18.340 --> 02:04:24.540]  passion for 30 odd years now of reading and studying about it so that's the one
[02:04:24.540 --> 02:04:30.340]  that really strikes home with me and also because my feelings about JFK of
[02:04:30.340 --> 02:04:36.620]  this if if a code a talk that happened if you can remove a president our
[02:04:36.620 --> 02:04:43.100]  president and get away with it well what can't you do that let's see that's what
[02:04:43.100 --> 02:04:47.820]  to me lays the table for anything that comes later if you can do that Alex what
[02:04:47.820 --> 02:04:52.100]  can't you do governor Jesse Ventura is our guest for the full hour we're gonna
[02:04:52.100 --> 02:04:56.460]  come right back and continue with the JFK investigation he's conducted he's
[02:04:56.460 --> 02:05:02.780]  got some groundbreaking information Alex told you the government announced
[02:05:02.780 --> 02:05:07.580]  recently that the recession is over it ended on June of 2009 the millions of
[02:05:07.580 --> 02:05:12.100]  Americans unable to find work might not agree perhaps a recession ended for the
[02:05:12.100 --> 02:05:15.500]  bankers and government employees but for the rest of us things seem to be
[02:05:15.500 --> 02:05:19.420]  getting worse gold and silver haven't heard the news either they've begun their

[02:08:00.780 --> 02:08:08.940]  he's the t-rex of political talk Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[02:08:08.940 --> 02:08:15.380]  former Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura is here with us today kicking off the
[02:08:15.380 --> 02:08:20.580]  promotion we're honored to have him for the second season of conspiracy theory
[02:08:20.580 --> 02:08:26.780]  here's USA today's headline Jesse Ventura's conspiracy theory raises
[02:08:26.780 --> 02:08:32.380]  further questions and it's a pretty balanced report here it's going to be
[02:08:32.380 --> 02:08:38.860]  kicking off October 15th 10 p.m. Eastern Time 9 p.m. Central on true TV it was
[02:08:38.860 --> 02:08:43.300]  the number one hit show last year and I had so many people saying only eight
[02:08:43.300 --> 02:08:49.060]  episodes we want more I've gotten so many emails so many calls so many you
[02:08:49.060 --> 02:08:52.780]  know people on the street have said you know bring back the show and and now
[02:08:52.780 --> 02:08:55.420]  that the second season has been announced people are calling me saying
[02:08:55.420 --> 02:09:01.420]  will there be a third season Jesse I don't know you know again this is cable
[02:09:01.420 --> 02:09:07.660]  or satellite television so it runs differently than than regular network
[02:09:07.660 --> 02:09:14.140]  TV in the fact that they buy them by for lack of better term the lots like they
[02:09:14.140 --> 02:09:18.580]  bought seven then they bought eight and that's the way they do it there it's not
[02:09:18.580 --> 02:09:23.820]  like a yearly thing like network TV does and all that so whether they they
[02:09:23.820 --> 02:09:27.820]  could order another eight of them at any moment they could do it today or they
[02:09:27.820 --> 02:09:31.900]  could wait till the conclusion or whatever and because that's the way it's
[02:09:31.900 --> 02:09:36.700]  done in cable television what if network TV wanted to say give you Larry King
[02:09:36.700 --> 02:09:40.620]  show because I know people talked about that or one of you to do a broadcast
[02:09:40.620 --> 02:09:47.980]  going to put me to replace Larry King right well what have you got offered a
[02:09:47.980 --> 02:09:53.500]  broadcast television show would you would you even accept it or or is or is
[02:09:53.500 --> 02:09:58.100]  Mexico too too much fun I don't know if you know again it's one of those
[02:09:58.100 --> 02:10:02.460]  hypotheticals Alex that until it happens I'm not going to even bother thinking
[02:10:02.460 --> 02:10:06.260]  about it because there's nothing you know happening right now that
[02:10:06.260 --> 02:10:12.540]  indicates that and and so I just keep doing what I do and now if if it does
[02:10:12.540 --> 02:10:17.300]  rear its head well then I'll have to sit down and make the decision on what
[02:10:17.300 --> 02:10:21.340]  you know what I prefer to do getting back into the television show for
[02:10:21.340 --> 02:10:24.620]  stations that just joined us we were talking about your favorite of the eight
[02:10:24.620 --> 02:10:30.260]  episodes of your investigations being the JFK and I I'm privy to some of the
[02:10:30.260 --> 02:10:32.620]  groundbreaking research you guys have done I don't know how much you can get
[02:10:32.620 --> 02:10:35.580]  into but you were making the point that if they can kill a president in broad
[02:10:35.580 --> 02:10:39.460]  daylight and get away with it they can do anything and that's basically what
[02:10:39.460 --> 02:10:43.780]  Bruce Willis told Vanity Fair last year he said you know my whole views change
[02:10:43.780 --> 02:10:48.180]  since I researched JFK because clearly the same people that killed him are in
[02:10:48.180 --> 02:10:53.980]  control today well it seems so you're gonna see a lot of tie-ins and I'll
[02:10:53.980 --> 02:10:59.460]  just say this and I'll be real open about it it's a great majority of our
[02:10:59.460 --> 02:11:05.580]  investigations and shows these eight shows in a great deal of them at some
[02:11:05.580 --> 02:11:09.460]  point at some point during the investigation
[02:11:09.460 --> 02:11:18.380]  Halliburton shows up it's amazing the tentacles that this company has into our
[02:11:18.380 --> 02:11:25.020]  foreign affairs and and things that are going on with our country it seems along
[02:11:25.020 --> 02:11:29.180]  with our country right below the United States comes the word Halliburton
[02:11:29.180 --> 02:11:36.780]  and of course we all know who operates and runs that good old Mr. Cheney yeah
[02:11:36.780 --> 02:11:43.460]  and I mean it's it's amazing every time I do it but conspiracy theory a great
[02:11:43.460 --> 02:11:51.820]  majority of them at some point paperwork will lead us to Halliburton when you were
[02:11:51.820 --> 02:11:55.220]  down here in Texas I don't know how much we can get into ahead of the show but I
[02:11:55.220 --> 02:12:00.620]  tell you that was amazing at that particular facility oh yeah oh yeah they
[02:12:00.620 --> 02:12:06.740]  all are and you know and you know and I I'll go into like in the JFK situation
[02:12:06.740 --> 02:12:11.020]  people I want them to tune in the show because they will hear the first
[02:12:11.020 --> 02:12:16.940]  confession and believe me Lee Oswe has been dead for a long time so it certainly
[02:12:16.940 --> 02:12:25.100]  isn't him would it be so you know that's the main thing I answer on JFK is the
[02:12:25.100 --> 02:12:31.580]  big question is well what will your show show this year that's new and I think
[02:12:31.580 --> 02:12:36.860]  the confession is pretty dynamic doing your in-depth I mean you've been
[02:12:36.860 --> 02:12:40.820]  studying the JFK assassination for decades your new books got us several
[02:12:40.820 --> 02:12:45.260]  very informative chapters American conspiracies that by the way we carry
[02:12:45.260 --> 02:12:51.100]  at info wars.com the folks want to get it but did your investigation just
[02:12:51.100 --> 02:12:55.500]  confirm your previous research or did it cause you to question? No I think it
[02:12:55.500 --> 02:13:00.460]  confirmed what I've believed in studying that particular conspiracy for many many
[02:13:00.460 --> 02:13:07.660]  years I felt very vindicated kind of sat back and thought gee I was right. You know
[02:13:07.660 --> 02:13:11.580]  I noticed consulting and and in traveling around the country to a few
[02:13:11.580 --> 02:13:15.500]  places whether you man here in Texas that over and over again it was a mirror
[02:13:15.500 --> 02:13:19.620]  of last season like when you were at harp when they hide inside the buildings
[02:13:19.620 --> 02:13:25.140]  and won't come out I mean they act very suspicious. Oh it's terrible I mean we we
[02:13:25.140 --> 02:13:32.660]  went to one place that they call a residence and I mean I've been a
[02:13:32.660 --> 02:13:37.740]  governor and I've traveled to state prisons before and I could not
[02:13:37.740 --> 02:13:41.620]  distinguish between the two except for the name on the front of the building.
[02:13:41.620 --> 02:13:47.740]  Yes a residence center with barbed wire and placecapes for children. Yeah and
[02:13:47.740 --> 02:13:53.020]  that was the real and and then the response is no comment I mean the thing
[02:13:53.020 --> 02:13:59.100]  that I hope people get out of this is that we can't even ask our government a
[02:13:59.100 --> 02:14:04.940]  question let alone expect them to give us an answer. That's what the great big
[02:14:04.940 --> 02:14:10.660]  story I'm learning and doing this show and I find that very offensive Alex
[02:14:10.660 --> 02:14:16.500]  because we are the ones that pay we're the tax payers and I'm sure I can
[02:14:16.500 --> 02:14:21.780]  compare South Minneapolis to Texas if the way it worked when I grew up in
[02:14:21.780 --> 02:14:26.740]  South Minneapolis is if you're paying out the money that makes you the boss. Yes.
[02:14:26.740 --> 02:14:32.700]  And somehow we've lost sight of that that we are the boss we are the ones that
[02:14:32.700 --> 02:14:40.580]  pay the money taxes these people work on our money so therefore we should be the
[02:14:40.580 --> 02:14:45.820]  boss now I understand that sure you've got national security issues sure you got
[02:14:45.820 --> 02:14:49.540]  things that you have to protect as a government I've been on both sides of
[02:14:49.540 --> 02:14:55.820]  the fence but the point is unless it deals with something of total national
[02:14:55.820 --> 02:15:00.820]  security why can't we we don't have to know the details but certainly they
[02:15:00.820 --> 02:15:07.700]  can admit to what things are like I'll tie it in with area 51 I mean everybody
[02:15:07.700 --> 02:15:11.820]  knows there's a base there yet the government officially doesn't denies
[02:15:11.820 --> 02:15:20.220]  one exists now what type of nonsense is that my tax dollars pay for that secret
[02:15:20.220 --> 02:15:25.220]  base out there and I think I have every right to know it exists and I think I
[02:15:25.220 --> 02:15:30.300]  have every right to be protected from it this base out there has no gate it has
[02:15:30.300 --> 02:15:35.980]  no distinguished markings that indicate that you're trespassing on a
[02:15:35.980 --> 02:15:40.980]  government base and yet there's a sign there that says they can use lethal force
[02:15:40.980 --> 02:15:45.820]  well look at what's happened very disturbing Alex they can kill you for
[02:15:45.820 --> 02:15:53.940]  trespassing technically well going back to 1947 governor they made the national
[02:15:53.940 --> 02:15:58.140]  security state through the National Security Act and since then tens of
[02:15:58.140 --> 02:16:02.620]  trillions of dollars go into a secret black hole trillions are missing from
[02:16:02.620 --> 02:16:07.020]  the Pentagon under Clinton Bush and now Obama they tell Congress in the C-span
[02:16:07.020 --> 02:16:10.540]  hearings we won't say where the money went foreign banks have stolen trillions
[02:16:10.540 --> 02:16:16.300]  in the bailout they won't say where the money went exactly I mean this is the
[02:16:16.300 --> 02:16:21.860]  biggest case of criminal white collar crime that could possibly be let's talk
[02:16:21.860 --> 02:16:29.460]  about that simply as basic as this Alex we can't even have a paper trail we
[02:16:29.460 --> 02:16:35.540]  can't even get a receipt like going to an ATM an ATM at least offers you a
[02:16:35.540 --> 02:16:40.500]  receipt something that you can have in the palm of your hand that says you did
[02:16:40.500 --> 02:16:44.980]  what you did we can't even get a receipt from our government over the
[02:16:44.980 --> 02:16:49.260]  millions and trillions of dollars and I have to laugh when the debate gets to
[02:16:49.260 --> 02:16:55.500]  health care and they talk about paying for it Alex if we just accounted for
[02:16:55.500 --> 02:17:00.500]  all the money in these two wars and all the rest of it they spend on this crap
[02:17:00.500 --> 02:17:04.700]  we could pay for health care to where we don't probably have our own doctor
[02:17:04.700 --> 02:17:10.060]  living in the garage well yeah that's true the total defense budget is two
[02:17:10.060 --> 02:17:14.140]  trillion every year a trillion 100 billion on record and another 800 plus
[02:17:14.140 --> 02:17:21.700]  billion on top of that governor speaking about secrecy and all of this
[02:17:21.700 --> 02:17:25.300]  we were talking about Congress keeps asking the banks where's the money and
[02:17:25.300 --> 02:17:29.780]  they say we won't tell you you you did do a big investigation on Wall Street
[02:17:29.780 --> 02:17:33.900]  talk about that well it's that Wall Street was the one that I thought was
[02:17:33.900 --> 02:17:40.420]  gonna be the most difficult show because it's so I mean these power brokers and
[02:17:40.420 --> 02:17:44.900]  their money they know how to put up the smoke screens they are professional at
[02:17:44.900 --> 02:17:52.860]  doing that of making things so convoluted so hard to understand and
[02:17:52.860 --> 02:17:58.460]  that's how they get away with it and but it turns out from all indication our
[02:17:58.460 --> 02:18:04.460]  people are telling me the Wall Street show could be the best of the lot because
[02:18:04.460 --> 02:18:10.420]  they said we managed to break it down into a simplistic form to where everyone
[02:18:10.420 --> 02:18:15.540]  out there will truly understand what happened give us as much of an insight
[02:18:15.540 --> 02:18:19.020]  into the episode as you can without giving it all away well it's just that
[02:18:19.020 --> 02:18:24.380]  we we go out there and we we deal with people some of them are going to prison
[02:18:24.380 --> 02:18:30.820]  and these are people that are at best mid-level and yet we're made to believe
[02:18:30.820 --> 02:18:35.340]  that these are that these are the culprits remember this about the whole
[02:18:35.340 --> 02:18:41.260]  Wall Street to Bollackle it if the people going to jail are not the ones
[02:18:41.260 --> 02:18:46.460]  truly responsible most of them were caught up in the middle of all this mess
[02:18:46.460 --> 02:18:51.220]  and really had no way to get out of it and they're the ones that are gonna fall
[02:18:51.220 --> 02:18:55.940]  on the sword go to the slammer well they always burn a few underlings sure and
[02:18:55.940 --> 02:18:59.500]  that's what's good that's what you're gonna see on our show we talked to a
[02:18:59.500 --> 02:19:03.700]  few of these underlings and I'll tell you they're very vocal because they're
[02:19:03.700 --> 02:19:07.980]  they're not very happy that they're the ones that are going to jail and the big
[02:19:07.980 --> 02:19:12.340]  criminals are walking away scot-free and more wealthy well I know a little bit
[02:19:12.340 --> 02:19:17.060]  about the show and the research it's bombshell and and are you worried again
[02:19:17.060 --> 02:19:20.220]  like you were last year and I mean you have any private bets with the crew
[02:19:20.220 --> 02:19:24.900]  that this may not air no I have full cops I'll be stunned this year if it
[02:19:24.900 --> 02:19:29.820]  doesn't they put everything on last year and there's no indication I've gotten
[02:19:29.820 --> 02:19:36.540]  whatsoever in fact Mark Juris who's they had a true TV he told me when I told
[02:19:36.540 --> 02:19:41.580]  him about my gentleman's bet he told me eye-to-eye he said I can assure you
[02:19:41.580 --> 02:19:47.220]  governor there wasn't one discussion about your show not going on well that's
[02:19:47.220 --> 02:19:51.020]  another big question they've denied world government they've denied CIA drug
[02:19:51.020 --> 02:19:54.900]  trafficking they've denied human experimentation you know giving people
[02:19:54.900 --> 02:19:59.060]  syphilis all over the United States and Latin America our own government now
[02:19:59.060 --> 02:20:02.820]  they just pretty much admit it like three months ago the CIA came out in the
[02:20:02.820 --> 02:20:07.540]  Washington Post and said yeah we put out fake bin Laden videos and then now
[02:20:07.540 --> 02:20:11.980]  they have Robert Shapiro who works with us because Alex they're so arrogant now
[02:20:11.980 --> 02:20:17.060]  because we we sit back and and I guess they figure there's nothing we can do
[02:20:17.060 --> 02:20:22.260]  about it anyway that's the only conclusion I can come to I agree with
[02:20:22.260 --> 02:20:26.380]  you but I think it's it's several things it's also that the alternative media has
[02:20:26.380 --> 02:20:30.460]  now overall displaced even the mainstream media and they can't deny this
[02:20:30.460 --> 02:20:35.580]  anymore so to keep any credibility they just have to basically admit some of
[02:20:35.580 --> 02:20:46.980]  this and that was my next question I'm sure you've seen in the news but it was
[02:20:46.980 --> 02:20:51.180]  in the BBC last week inventor of the internet no it's not Al Gore the real
[02:20:51.180 --> 02:20:55.460]  inventor came out that guys Google that put it on screen for me you know inventor
[02:20:55.460 --> 02:20:59.140]  of internet came out and said the internet is being shut down incrementally
[02:20:59.140 --> 02:21:03.700]  with this cyber security and I noticed that they admit now in the media that
[02:21:03.700 --> 02:21:09.860]  Israel launched this this this this worm that attacked Iran and China and
[02:21:09.860 --> 02:21:13.780]  others but then the government came out and said see we need cyber security to
[02:21:13.780 --> 02:21:17.900]  take over the infrastructure of the web and spy on you because of this new worm
[02:21:17.900 --> 02:21:22.260]  they the government launches the attack and then says we need to take your rights
[02:21:22.260 --> 02:21:27.100]  to keep you safe of course that's standard operating procedure you know
[02:21:27.100 --> 02:21:32.660]  people need to understand clearly that whenever government tells you they're
[02:21:32.660 --> 02:21:37.500]  gonna protect you and keep you safe the only way they can achieve that is by
[02:21:37.500 --> 02:21:43.220]  putting you under by taking your freedoms and I personally and I'm
[02:21:43.220 --> 02:21:49.820]  speaking only for myself I would rather have my freedoms and face the fears of
[02:21:49.820 --> 02:21:57.140]  life than I would to be given this cozy safety bet underneath the domain that
[02:21:57.140 --> 02:22:01.980]  allows me to freedom there's a new report out from Tennessee where a guy in the
[02:22:01.980 --> 02:22:07.300]  county didn't pay a $75 fire department tax so they came out and watched his
[02:22:07.300 --> 02:22:11.260]  house burn but then put the neighbors out because that house then caught the
[02:22:11.260 --> 02:22:15.780]  neighbor's house on fire whatever happened to the laws about failure to
[02:22:15.780 --> 02:22:18.620]  render aid if I'm driving down the street and somebody's just got a car
[02:22:18.620 --> 02:22:21.980]  wreck and I don't stop and help them I can go to prison but but now under
[02:22:21.980 --> 02:22:27.380]  privatization our taxes go up but they're laying off police firemen and
[02:22:27.380 --> 02:22:31.140]  they're saying if you don't pay all these new fees when your house is burning
[02:22:31.140 --> 02:22:36.300]  we're not gonna put it out well indeed that's that's a that's a total shame
[02:22:36.300 --> 02:22:39.940]  and it's it's we should be embarrassed that's something like that could happen
[02:22:39.940 --> 02:22:47.620]  um well it's it's read what I brought up in my USA Today article Alex I mean I'm
[02:22:47.620 --> 02:22:53.060]  sure I'm gonna get plenty of flack over this I said far more important than
[02:22:53.060 --> 02:22:58.620]  building a mosque in New York City is I would like to ask why religion doesn't
[02:22:58.620 --> 02:23:02.700]  have to pay property taxes for the services that they receive and they're
[02:23:02.700 --> 02:23:08.300]  rendered on an equal basis that all the rest of us have to pay for which is fire
[02:23:08.300 --> 02:23:17.700]  police and and uh uh uh the maintenance of your streets how come churches get
[02:23:17.700 --> 02:23:23.180]  back for free well I'll say this all the rest of us have to pay when they're
[02:23:23.180 --> 02:23:28.920]  getting me I mean if someone disrupts church a policeman will come in at the
[02:23:28.920 --> 02:23:33.460]  call and take care of it if the church catches on fire the fire department will
[02:23:33.460 --> 02:23:38.260]  put it out and if they need their roads plowed up in Minnesota the public
[02:23:38.260 --> 02:23:44.300]  plows do it how come they don't have to pay and everybody else does well I'll
[02:23:44.300 --> 02:23:47.420]  say this because in the first amendment it says Congress shall make no law
[02:23:47.420 --> 02:23:50.540]  respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise
[02:23:50.540 --> 02:23:55.380]  thereof and I agree with nothing to do with that this is called getting
[02:23:55.380 --> 02:24:01.100]  services from the public domain on a piece of property well I'll be honest
[02:24:01.100 --> 02:24:05.900]  nothing to do with restricting religion no I'll be honest with you with the
[02:24:05.900 --> 02:24:10.220]  power to taxes the power to destroy I didn't know that churches didn't have
[02:24:10.220 --> 02:24:15.340]  to pay for the fire department well that's enough to pay for nothing at least
[02:24:15.340 --> 02:24:19.540]  in Minnesota maybe in Texas they do but I can unequivocally tell you in
[02:24:19.540 --> 02:24:24.220]  Minnesota on how to lay our property tax system and I think it's the same
[02:24:24.220 --> 02:24:32.060]  everywhere religious places don't have to pay nothing well I'll say this the
[02:24:32.060 --> 02:24:35.420]  reason they didn't want that because of the government starts having taxes they
[02:24:35.420 --> 02:24:39.740]  can then have tax incentives like George Bush's faith-based initiative where the
[02:24:39.740 --> 02:24:44.420]  government starts paying churches and this is Alex this is apples and oranges
[02:24:44.420 --> 02:24:49.620]  this is owning property and getting public services brought to that property
[02:24:49.620 --> 02:24:55.260]  no no I understand what you're saying that to me you can't absolve them of
[02:24:55.260 --> 02:25:00.980]  that just for fear of the other that shouldn't happen they should be some
[02:25:00.980 --> 02:25:06.780]  buildings these are properties that get services from the public domain which we
[02:25:06.780 --> 02:25:12.780]  all chip in and pay for okay if you're an atheist why should your tax dollars
[02:25:12.780 --> 02:25:16.980]  if you don't believe in God and you don't believe in any of that why should
[02:25:16.980 --> 02:25:22.420]  your tax dollars go to pay for those places to get services rent no no I see
[02:25:22.420 --> 02:25:26.460]  your point just like in Travis County why should I have to pay money to pay
[02:25:26.460 --> 02:25:30.380]  for elective abortions and that's the problem once we get a big government
[02:25:30.380 --> 02:25:36.540]  period then a lot of us are forced to be you know paying for things that that you
[02:25:36.540 --> 02:25:40.820]  know we don't want well no it's not even don't want it's if it's out there
[02:25:40.820 --> 02:25:46.820]  anyone that uses it should be required to participate that's the difference
[02:25:46.820 --> 02:25:52.900]  Alex they're using it it's being provided and they're not having to pay
[02:25:52.900 --> 02:25:58.780]  for that participation why now it's an interesting point why do they get off
[02:25:58.780 --> 02:26:03.780]  free why why does all the rest of us have to pay and like I said if you an
[02:26:03.780 --> 02:26:10.100]  atheist you have to pay and this entity doesn't and it's not getting in the
[02:26:10.100 --> 02:26:15.940]  portion or anything like that it's doing daily things that happen in life that
[02:26:15.940 --> 02:26:21.860]  are required to be done how come they get a free ride on it well it's a powerful
[02:26:21.860 --> 02:26:26.020]  lobby but I do see your point shifting gears another subject you talk you talk
[02:26:26.020 --> 02:26:30.460]  about your father even before people were protesting the Vietnam War and of
[02:26:30.460 --> 02:26:34.820]  course he was a highly decorated World War two veteran he was criticizing the
[02:26:34.820 --> 02:26:38.820]  Vietnam War beforehand you talk about your father in USA today oh yeah no I
[02:26:38.820 --> 02:26:42.740]  just told them the story about how my dad I would come home with the teachings
[02:26:42.740 --> 02:26:47.660]  that they were teaching me in school and my father and I would be at the dinner
[02:26:47.660 --> 02:26:52.900]  table and have battles over it because he didn't feel we were being told the
[02:26:52.900 --> 02:26:58.860]  real truth in school and it turned out he was correct and I always liked to
[02:26:58.860 --> 02:27:04.780]  laugh about it today my dad died 91 but I always tell people you know it's
[02:27:04.780 --> 02:27:11.500]  amazing he died 91 but he gets smarter every day so the things he told me
[02:27:11.500 --> 02:27:17.980]  growing up now that I'm 59 years old I'm looking back and remembering how
[02:27:17.980 --> 02:27:23.940]  extremely bright this man was about world affairs and here's a guy that only
[02:27:23.940 --> 02:27:28.820]  went to eighth grade he was a World War two veteran and worked his whole life
[02:27:28.820 --> 02:27:35.540]  as a street laborer you know it's he do a lot of stuff well it's sad that so many
[02:27:35.540 --> 02:27:39.660]  of that great generation are dying off both my grandfather's of course World
[02:27:39.660 --> 02:27:43.860]  War two veterans and you know when we're out on the road driving around or in
[02:27:43.860 --> 02:27:48.980]  airports you talk a lot about your dad and those lessons he taught you briefly
[02:27:48.980 --> 02:27:53.700]  get into that story about he was really too old to even join the military and
[02:27:53.700 --> 02:27:59.100]  all the combat he saw well he my dad went into age 36 which was the oldest you
[02:27:59.100 --> 02:28:05.660]  could possibly be and he he had I think six bronze battle stars he was not
[02:28:05.660 --> 02:28:11.500]  North Africa then Normandy Battle of the Bell Dramagen Bridge and Zio and
[02:28:11.500 --> 02:28:17.580]  finally Berlin and he got out of four years and I got out and the fun part of
[02:28:17.580 --> 02:28:23.380]  the story is when he got into his latter 60s my aunt went back to Pennsylvania to
[02:28:23.380 --> 02:28:27.540]  the coal mining towns where he was born and they discovered his birth
[02:28:27.540 --> 02:28:31.700]  certificate that turned out he was a year older than he thought he was so he was
[02:28:31.700 --> 02:28:35.780]  too old even the in really yeah he was he technically was too old to be allowed
[02:28:35.780 --> 02:28:41.380]  in the military and or maybe he knew and just lied to go anyway I don't know you
[02:28:41.380 --> 02:28:45.900]  know about that your mom was in the war too yeah my mom was a nurse in North
[02:28:45.900 --> 02:28:53.340]  Africa and she served in North Africa and and the amazing thing about her was
[02:28:53.340 --> 02:28:58.260]  as she got old every night they do the reruns of mash and she would watch the
[02:28:58.260 --> 02:29:02.820]  evening news and never miss mash right after it before she'd go to bed which
[02:29:02.820 --> 02:29:06.900]  was probably very similar because mash was Korea and it was probably very
[02:29:06.900 --> 02:29:11.700]  similar to you know just a few years earlier in North Africa and of course
[02:29:11.700 --> 02:29:15.220]  your dad being in the European theater and the North African that was really
[02:29:15.220 --> 02:29:18.700]  the toughest battles they say statistically was against Erwin Rommel the
[02:29:18.700 --> 02:29:23.620]  Desert Fox yeah that's what they say you know the knowledge that I have of it
[02:29:23.620 --> 02:29:28.220]  and you know knowing that my mom and dad were both in North Africa against Rommel
[02:29:28.220 --> 02:29:32.940]  who was probably the best Nazi general I would have all accounts of me didn't
[02:29:32.940 --> 02:29:36.500]  Hitler have him killed in the end he was jealous of him because Rommel was
[02:29:36.500 --> 02:29:40.820]  secretly trying to work with folks to get rid of Hitler governor Jesse Ventura
[02:29:40.820 --> 02:29:44.980]  is our guest to the new show premieres the 15th of October we're gonna come back

[02:29:56.940 --> 02:30:00.020]  radio network
[02:30:01.660 --> 02:30:06.460]  hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone this
[02:30:06.460 --> 02:30:12.100]  is our last chance to not relive history as a finishing off this agenda that we
[02:30:12.100 --> 02:30:15.660]  pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home I've turned in this
[02:30:15.660 --> 02:30:20.740]  influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the shots I
[02:30:20.740 --> 02:30:26.100]  think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention for
[02:30:26.100 --> 02:30:31.020]  the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel
[02:30:31.020 --> 02:30:35.420]  held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world
[02:30:35.420 --> 02:30:39.140]  government Tim Geithner Bernanke their arsonists they're asking for more
[02:30:39.140 --> 02:30:43.100]  matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the checkout to today seems
[02:30:43.100 --> 02:30:48.660]  like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of

[02:33:07.780 --> 02:33:12.820]  former governor Jesse Ventura and this is the Alex Jones show I recommend you
[02:33:12.820 --> 02:33:18.060]  all pay attention to Alex because Alex and I are teaming up again this fall for
[02:33:18.060 --> 02:33:22.580]  a second season of conspiracy theory where we will attempt to get to the
[02:33:22.580 --> 02:33:29.980]  bottom of these conspiracies until then keep watching and listening to Alex
[02:33:32.980 --> 02:33:39.940]  I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against every form of
[02:33:39.940 --> 02:33:47.300]  tyranny over the mind of man Thomas Jefferson it's Alex Jones on the GCN
[02:33:47.300 --> 02:33:55.100]  radio network well the man himself the iconic Jesse Ventura is our guest for
[02:33:55.100 --> 02:33:59.300]  the rest of this hour and we appreciate him giving us the first radio
[02:33:59.300 --> 02:34:04.100]  interview as he kicks off the promotion for the second season of conspiracy
[02:34:04.100 --> 02:34:09.540]  theory Jesse can do you know yet what the first episode is going to be what
[02:34:09.540 --> 02:34:13.220]  they're gonna air for I can't tell you it's in the stone but I think the first
[02:34:13.220 --> 02:34:17.940]  one is Plum Island let's talk about Plum Island then we'll get into water
[02:34:17.940 --> 02:34:22.100]  that's another episode yeah well Plum Island what's interesting about that
[02:34:22.100 --> 02:34:27.100]  of course is it's located right on the end of Long Island and really what
[02:34:27.100 --> 02:34:32.660]  intrigued you about it is to go into the history of it it's it's a biological
[02:34:32.660 --> 02:34:40.100]  center where our government tests out biological diseases on animals in which
[02:34:40.100 --> 02:34:44.420]  like hoof and mouth and things like that to prevent it that's the upfront
[02:34:44.420 --> 02:34:50.980]  story about about Plum Island now the conspiracy in Plum Island is this
[02:34:50.980 --> 02:34:56.100]  Lyme disease the first recorded case was found in Lyme Connecticut which is
[02:34:56.100 --> 02:35:00.820]  right across the water from Plum Island and then you go into the history of
[02:35:00.820 --> 02:35:06.420]  Plum Island and you learn this the godfather of Plum Island is a Nazi
[02:35:06.420 --> 02:35:10.820]  named Eric Traub and at the end of World War two he was right underneath
[02:35:10.820 --> 02:35:17.220]  Himmler and his expertise was creating biological warfare using ticks and
[02:35:17.220 --> 02:35:22.020]  mosquitoes and inflicting them upon another country with devastation of
[02:35:22.020 --> 02:35:26.900]  biological warfare well he probably should have stood trial at Nuremberg but
[02:35:26.900 --> 02:35:30.820]  of course we all know at the end of World War two there was a battle between
[02:35:30.820 --> 02:35:35.660]  us and the Soviets of how many scientists we could all get and he's one
[02:35:35.660 --> 02:35:40.940]  that made it here and now we're good to that we got Warner Von Braun who's the
[02:35:40.940 --> 02:35:46.180]  godfather of our space program in NASA but we also got Eric Traub whose
[02:35:46.180 --> 02:35:52.420]  expertise was biological warfare using ticks and mosquitoes he is the godfather
[02:35:52.420 --> 02:35:59.140]  of Plum Island he is the man that created this place so I mean call me you
[02:35:59.140 --> 02:36:07.220]  know paranoid Alex but anytime I know that a Nazi created something and we're
[02:36:07.220 --> 02:36:14.020]  now using it my suspicion rate goes up is that the logical thing to do well
[02:36:14.020 --> 02:36:19.180]  absolutely and as you know they're now building 36 level four bio weapons labs
[02:36:19.180 --> 02:36:24.420]  in the middle of nowhere but also in major cities like San Antonio Texas and
[02:36:24.420 --> 02:36:28.180]  in places like that and there's a lot of evidence that not just Lyme disease
[02:36:28.180 --> 02:36:35.580]  came from Plum Island but also that the West Nile virus and so many other
[02:36:35.580 --> 02:36:40.580]  zoological types things and now we're gonna put this on screen I'm sure you it
[02:36:40.580 --> 02:36:44.180]  came out a few days ago that not only did they give black men syphilis for 40
[02:36:44.180 --> 02:36:47.500]  plus years and kill them and let them spread it but now they've apologized for
[02:36:47.500 --> 02:36:53.020]  the US government in secret testing injecting thousands of Guatemalans with
[02:36:53.020 --> 02:36:59.980]  syphilis I mean Alex am I missing something or would we classify that
[02:36:59.980 --> 02:37:06.700]  terrorism it is terrorism yes yeah I mean how come our country can do things
[02:37:06.700 --> 02:37:11.300]  that are terrorists and we're not called yeah I mean I got in trouble you know
[02:37:11.300 --> 02:37:17.100]  Fox TV won't have me on anymore because I made the statement on there when I was
[02:37:17.100 --> 02:37:22.140]  on the months ago I said that why are we so shocked that we would get attacked by
[02:37:22.140 --> 02:37:27.300]  terrorists when our country's been practicing terrorism for going on 50
[02:37:27.300 --> 02:37:33.540]  years we just call it foreign policy and they got angry and asked me to cite an
[02:37:33.540 --> 02:37:38.500]  example and the quick one that came into my head I said well what about Cuba I
[02:37:38.500 --> 02:37:43.380]  said we've attempted to assassinate their leader on multiple occasions I
[02:37:43.380 --> 02:37:48.340]  said we've we tried to destroy their cane fields we've bombed ships in their
[02:37:48.340 --> 02:37:54.940]  harbor and of course we all know you and I about the nice guy Orlando Bosch he's
[02:37:54.940 --> 02:37:59.780]  a guy that blew up a Cuban civilian aircraft with a hundred some people on
[02:37:59.780 --> 02:38:04.660]  board and was pardoned by George Bush senior yeah that walking free today the
[02:38:04.660 --> 02:38:09.020]  Cuban Olympic team and that's admitted that he was CIA contracted yeah and now
[02:38:09.020 --> 02:38:13.860]  is that not an act of terrorism well let me bring this up to you then if
[02:38:13.860 --> 02:38:18.180]  that's not been explained to me the difference well well there's two issues
[02:38:18.180 --> 02:38:21.020]  here and I want to get back into the government sponsored terror both the
[02:38:21.020 --> 02:38:25.380]  stuff they staged but the the open terror that they call foreign policy a
[02:38:25.380 --> 02:38:30.140]  thousand drones bombing Pakistan and and they admitted they kill one person of
[02:38:30.140 --> 02:38:34.020]  interest that may be a terrorist they claim it's okay to kill a hundred
[02:38:34.020 --> 02:38:38.420]  innocent people at a wedding but but and I want you to speak to that governor
[02:38:38.420 --> 02:38:41.940]  but separately you're saying specifically well because that's big news
[02:38:41.940 --> 02:38:45.900]  Fox News has told you because I was used to be on there all the time as a
[02:38:45.900 --> 02:38:50.660]  guest you're not allowed on now because they don't officially tell me but they
[02:38:50.660 --> 02:38:58.540]  won't book me the last time I went you know it used to be I could at least get
[02:38:58.540 --> 02:39:04.180]  on with Hannity now I can't even get on with him that Kennedy O'Reilly and all
[02:39:04.180 --> 02:39:09.500]  of them see they're the kind of guys that they thrive upon being able to
[02:39:09.500 --> 02:39:13.820]  bully people and the problem is I can't be bullied usually well that's the issue
[02:39:13.820 --> 02:39:18.180]  is that Glenn Beck calls you stupid but I know you well you're extremely smart
[02:39:18.180 --> 02:39:23.380]  but also street smart that calls me stupid yeah guys YouTube Glenn Beck
[02:39:23.380 --> 02:39:27.460]  calls Jesse Ventura stupid he does an imitation of you he says yeah I was in
[02:39:27.460 --> 02:39:31.780]  a dressing room with him this way Alex this comes from a guy who's only claimed
[02:39:31.780 --> 02:39:40.420]  to fame in his entire life history is being a top 40 disc jockey absolutely
[02:39:40.420 --> 02:39:44.380]  and he calls it and he says I'm stupid huh well I'm gonna try to pull this club
[02:39:44.380 --> 02:39:49.940]  but no I don't care I consider the source but I mean coming from a guy
[02:39:49.940 --> 02:39:54.060]  and nothing against disc jockeys you know I have nothing against that
[02:39:54.060 --> 02:39:59.100]  profession it's an honor but I know you well but you can't hardly call yourself
[02:39:59.100 --> 02:40:03.980]  a foreign policy specialist if your entire background is being a disc jockey
[02:40:03.980 --> 02:40:08.020]  well well my point is is that in the tape it was from his radio show he claims
[02:40:08.020 --> 02:40:11.340]  that you were in a dressing room with him and quote tried to intimidate him
[02:40:11.340 --> 02:40:18.220]  if memory serves and absolutely I I intimidate all the people at Fox he
[02:40:18.220 --> 02:40:22.940]  joins a good company called O'Reilly Hannity and the rest of them well I was
[02:40:22.940 --> 02:40:27.380]  gonna expand on that I mean I've seen you with Hannity where he completely
[02:40:27.380 --> 02:40:31.820]  capitulates and they're just unable to dominate you but you're not bullying
[02:40:31.820 --> 02:40:36.460]  them you're very calm and and and just lay out the facts the thing is you have
[02:40:36.460 --> 02:40:41.620]  to remember something Alex you have to treat journalists in different ways
[02:40:41.620 --> 02:40:47.260]  because each one of them thrives on being successful in a certain manner and
[02:40:47.260 --> 02:40:54.500]  the Fox people thrive on being bullies so the key to interviewing with them is
[02:40:54.500 --> 02:41:00.460]  to show them they can't bully you and that you know you in turn bully them
[02:41:00.460 --> 02:41:07.300]  did you see when John Stuart was on with O'Reilly I mean John Stuart
[02:41:07.300 --> 02:41:12.220]  destroyed O'Reilly it's the first time I've seen O'Reilly lose control of his
[02:41:12.220 --> 02:41:18.220]  show John Stuart had full control of O'Reilly show and O'Reilly was just
[02:41:18.220 --> 02:41:23.620]  pumping in little bits and pieces when he could yes I have seen that and if
[02:41:23.620 --> 02:41:28.300]  anybody is a bully it's it's O'Reilly he'll cut off a mile he'll cut off
[02:41:28.300 --> 02:41:32.420]  people's mics he'll get in their face and tell them to shut up they all are
[02:41:32.420 --> 02:41:37.540]  it isn't just him they're all that way that's the persona there well people
[02:41:37.540 --> 02:41:43.940]  need to understand Fox News is not Fox News it's Fox Entertainment well well
[02:41:43.940 --> 02:41:47.380]  since we raised this I want you to hear it and be able to comment here's Glenn
[02:41:47.380 --> 02:41:53.460]  Beck talking about Governor Jesse Ventura here it is I heard Jesse Ventura what a
[02:41:53.460 --> 02:42:03.220]  dope this guy is I heard Jesse Ventura who's nothing but a big fat dumb bully
[02:42:03.220 --> 02:42:10.060]  and trust me I know he tried to intimidate me in the in the makeup room
[02:42:10.060 --> 02:42:17.060]  one day before CNN show and he's just a bully he's big dumb he's slow he's
[02:42:17.060 --> 02:42:21.820]  definitely a big dumb animal and he is a bully that's you know the you know the
[02:42:21.820 --> 02:42:29.460]  only offense I take out of that Alex what the only offense I take how dare Glenn
[02:42:29.460 --> 02:42:42.980]  Beck called me fat not dare him that's that butterball called me fat excuse me I used to be called Jesse the body Ventura
[02:42:42.980 --> 02:42:48.380]  well I gotta say granted I am not in the shape that I was in when I was at the peak
[02:42:48.380 --> 02:42:53.660]  of my pro wrestling career at the height of athleticism but I still am in pretty
[02:42:53.660 --> 02:42:59.580]  good shape let me be clear that's I take from that is having Glenn Beck called me
[02:42:59.580 --> 02:43:06.300]  fat when's the last time he looked into a mirror well he certainly isn't a
[02:43:06.300 --> 02:43:10.500]  feminine twerp but but I mean to be serious here I remember right after you
[02:43:10.500 --> 02:43:14.100]  had your hip surgery you came down and visited me in Austin and and that was
[02:43:14.100 --> 02:43:17.780]  the biggest you'd ever been maybe maybe ten pounds overweight but you know when
[02:43:17.780 --> 02:43:21.740]  we were flying around the country I saw you pull your shirt up a few times we
[02:43:21.740 --> 02:43:25.380]  were changing and stuff and I mean for somebody who's 59 I've never seen anybody
[02:43:25.380 --> 02:43:30.660]  with ripped muscles like you governor well I'm not the best built 59 year old
[02:43:30.660 --> 02:43:36.020]  in the world I'm not going to claim that but I train every day I work out
[02:43:36.020 --> 02:43:42.420]  constantly if you're going to go down an attempt to surf in Mexico do you think
[02:43:42.420 --> 02:43:47.660]  you can do it being big and fat there's Glenn that's what he called me I can't
[02:43:47.660 --> 02:43:57.500]  believe he could have him of all people could call me fat that right there
[02:43:57.500 --> 02:44:02.060]  should kill Glenn Beck's credibility completely well I didn't mean to get off
[02:44:02.060 --> 02:44:07.980]  into him I know I'm laughing about it Alex it's good humor I'm not but I rate
[02:44:07.980 --> 02:44:13.460]  there nothing about that I consider the source well you know Glenn is covering a
[02:44:13.460 --> 02:44:16.940]  lot of world government stuff but then he blames it on low-level Communist
[02:44:16.940 --> 02:44:20.700]  professors instead of admitting our Pentagon I have the Rand Corporation
[02:44:20.700 --> 02:44:25.700]  documents I have the global trends 2025 a transformed world the policy of the
[02:44:25.700 --> 02:44:29.260]  megabanks that run the military industrial complex that Eisenhower warned
[02:44:29.260 --> 02:44:34.020]  us about is to have corporate welfare and to steal the wealth of the people to
[02:44:34.020 --> 02:44:37.300]  make us more easily controlled and meanwhile he's claiming some low-level
[02:44:37.300 --> 02:44:41.380]  professor you know is the top of the pyramid and I think people are getting
[02:44:41.380 --> 02:44:45.140]  wise to him that's why his ratings are plunging and the New York Times talked
[02:44:45.140 --> 02:44:48.940]  to him and he admitted that he's got major friction with Fox and they may
[02:44:48.940 --> 02:44:53.180]  throw him under the bus I mean you may not see Glenn back in a year well you
[02:44:53.180 --> 02:44:58.340]  know what he won't care he's made his money you know he's become
[02:44:58.340 --> 02:45:03.380]  exceptionally wealthy for what he does because of and let me throw that out to
[02:45:03.380 --> 02:45:09.340]  the people of the United States because of the millions of lemmings out there
[02:45:09.340 --> 02:45:14.780]  they could take someone like Glenn back and make him a Messiah I mean what does
[02:45:14.780 --> 02:45:18.100]  he care for Alex he's made a ton of money well I think that's the
[02:45:18.100 --> 02:45:22.340]  establishment joke they got a feminine and I was reading the New York Times
[02:45:22.340 --> 02:45:27.460]  article they admitted he's a feminine said that's good and and and and they
[02:45:27.460 --> 02:45:30.780]  admitted constantly flip-flops and they said they're proud of that in this New
[02:45:30.780 --> 02:45:36.700]  York Times piece and so the face of the anti-New World Order unless you talk
[02:45:36.700 --> 02:45:42.780]  about Alex Jones Ron Paul or Jesse Ventura is Glenn Beck who just radiates
[02:45:42.780 --> 02:45:48.300]  it's not even fair to women to call him a feminine it's it's well you know again
[02:45:48.300 --> 02:45:54.620]  I'm more disappointed in the people of this country than I am him you know how
[02:45:54.620 --> 02:45:59.220]  could they be led by the nose by somebody who's that is unqualified at
[02:45:59.220 --> 02:46:06.660]  anything is him he's never done anything he found a bitch in the in the
[02:46:06.660 --> 02:46:10.740]  radio world and the TV world and he found a bitch of people that he could
[02:46:10.740 --> 02:46:15.380]  lead I mean you know remember there that the people are easily led you know
[02:46:15.380 --> 02:46:19.940]  well he criticizes Obama which is fair for reading off a teleprompter but he
[02:46:19.940 --> 02:46:24.500]  admits he uses a teleprompter everybody does the teleprompter is a marvelous
[02:46:24.500 --> 02:46:28.660]  thing I think the only I think the only jealousy comes in the fact that George
[02:46:28.660 --> 02:46:35.900]  Bush couldn't read one we're running out of time and this interview is really
[02:46:35.900 --> 02:46:39.980]  getting powerful here but I want to get back into the episodes let's talk about
[02:46:39.980 --> 02:46:42.940]  the water episode because I was asking her to break I said what do you think
[02:46:42.940 --> 02:46:46.620]  is the most scary and you said water and I tend to agree with you because these
[02:46:46.620 --> 02:46:50.540]  multi-nationals well I mean tell folks what you discover I go out with the
[02:46:50.540 --> 02:46:56.140]  Native American chief and we go to Lake Mead if I bite Hoover Dam you know the
[02:46:56.140 --> 02:47:00.420]  water source from Las Vegas I got let me finish with this I got news for you
[02:47:00.420 --> 02:47:06.380]  people within the decade Las Vegas is gonna have no water Lake Mead is down
[02:47:06.380 --> 02:47:17.700]  125 feet let me repeat that 125 feet down I stood on a plateau there 60 feet
[02:47:17.700 --> 02:47:22.860]  below the ledge where docks were still up there where less than a decade ago
[02:47:22.860 --> 02:47:28.900]  kids were fishing off them the water was now 60 feet below where I was standing
[02:47:28.900 --> 02:47:36.300]  at and the water show that we do if it does not terrify the people of this
[02:47:36.300 --> 02:47:40.500]  country then nothing will and of course you interview me for that you came to
[02:47:40.500 --> 02:47:43.820]  Austin to investigate it but but but how much more the investigation can you
[02:47:43.820 --> 02:47:48.100]  talk about I mean clearly you show how these that's enough Alex just to say it
[02:47:48.100 --> 02:47:52.340]  leads us to the north at the northern Peninsula of Michigan and the Great
[02:47:52.340 --> 02:47:58.060]  Lakes which is home to 20 percent of the world's fresh drinking water and who
[02:47:58.060 --> 02:48:02.500]  gets to have the water we don't get to have it but somebody else does well
[02:48:02.500 --> 02:48:09.540]  watch the show I will be very clear on the show what can you say about the
[02:48:09.540 --> 02:48:17.700]  police state camps show well that I will say this it again reaffirms you all
[02:48:17.700 --> 02:48:22.380]  remember when Michael Moore spoke to congressman connears and he set Michael
[02:48:22.380 --> 02:48:25.700]  Moore down and said let me tell you something we don't even read the bills
[02:48:25.700 --> 02:48:32.340]  we vote on yes you will be reassured of that again because I sit down with the
[02:48:32.340 --> 02:48:37.860]  congressman who assures me up and down that there are no FEMA internment camps
[02:48:37.860 --> 02:48:42.980]  being built in the country and when we you should see how funny it is on camera
[02:48:42.980 --> 02:48:49.060]  when we then show him the bill he was co-sponsor of a homeland security which
[02:48:49.060 --> 02:48:53.740]  states that they would be building no less than six of them and that's on top
[02:48:53.740 --> 02:48:56.580]  of the other camps they've got under some he didn't even know it was in the
[02:48:56.580 --> 02:49:02.620]  bill that's the point these people are not reading what they vote on they're
[02:49:02.620 --> 02:49:08.220]  being told by the political parties how to vote let's get into another episode
[02:49:08.220 --> 02:49:11.900]  what can you say about the oil spill I mean this is really powerful well again
[02:49:11.900 --> 02:49:15.820]  the oil spill we investigate conspiracies and to be blunt and
[02:49:15.820 --> 02:49:20.100]  straightforward there's a strong suspicion and a lot of circumstantial
[02:49:20.100 --> 02:49:26.740]  evidence that that oil spill was done intentionally and you know we talked to
[02:49:26.740 --> 02:49:29.420]  some homeless people down there were actually clean cut who came down to get
[02:49:29.420 --> 02:49:33.300]  jobs and they said they wouldn't hire for the cleanup you said exactly what I
[02:49:33.300 --> 02:49:37.980]  was thinking you said hey buddy be glad you didn't get that job with exactly
[02:49:37.980 --> 02:49:44.180]  because you know that the stuff they're using down there this disperse it has
[02:49:44.180 --> 02:49:50.380]  four lethal chemicals in it including I think cadmium and arsenic and two other
[02:49:50.380 --> 02:49:56.500]  lovely things and I'm for the life of me trying to figure out how adding
[02:49:56.500 --> 02:50:04.300]  billions of barrels of lethal chemicals to already saturated oil water is a good
[02:50:04.300 --> 02:50:10.420]  thing I can't figure that out now I am not a scientist but it doesn't make
[02:50:10.420 --> 02:50:17.700]  sense to me that by adding poison to the water is going to be beneficial more
[02:50:17.700 --> 02:50:24.980]  so than just the oil in the water now you got two of them in there we're gonna
[02:50:24.980 --> 02:50:29.620]  come back with our final segment of Governor Jesse Ventura I might twist his
[02:50:29.620 --> 02:50:35.900]  heart really five more minutes in the next hour and and we'll get into all
[02:50:35.900 --> 02:50:40.740]  this hyping of stage terror and we'll talk about another 9-11 investigation

[02:54:30.620 --> 02:54:34.300]  know the days are getting shorter it's getting cold up here in Minnesota and
[02:54:34.300 --> 02:54:38.820]  the window of golf is slowly closing and that tells me it's time to start
[02:54:38.820 --> 02:54:42.980]  surfing that what are you shooting in golf oh I'm just a you know if I'm
[02:54:42.980 --> 02:54:47.540]  shooting well I shoot in the 80s if I'm shooting not so well I play in the 90s
[02:54:47.540 --> 02:54:50.260]  that's pretty good you got to get you down here and play our producer jaren
[02:54:50.260 --> 02:54:54.980]  he's yeah he's a pretty good guy now governor we've only had about four
[02:54:54.980 --> 02:54:58.900]  minutes left I'm sure you've seen the hype that you know the terrorists we
[02:54:58.900 --> 02:55:03.340]  have specific targets in Europe in the US turns out they had drills planned two
[02:55:03.340 --> 02:55:09.740]  months ago it's a global drill and it just so happens it was scheduled for
[02:55:09.740 --> 02:55:13.900]  this week and we have all these White House people even under Obama saying we
[02:55:13.900 --> 02:55:17.440]  need a terror attack that's in the financial times of London to make people
[02:55:17.440 --> 02:55:21.180]  trust their government again you know Governor Ridge admitted they issued fake
[02:55:21.180 --> 02:55:25.460]  terror alerts under Bush is that not psychological terrorism yeah well it
[02:55:25.460 --> 02:55:30.460]  also you know if they're talking like that then it kind of winds back to 9
[02:55:30.460 --> 02:55:36.900]  11 should we start questioning it you know if it takes a terror attack to
[02:55:36.900 --> 02:55:42.140]  bring the country together then the country is in pretty bad shape in my
[02:55:42.140 --> 02:55:48.260]  opinion and and you know that the timing of these things they always do them
[02:55:48.260 --> 02:55:52.060]  look at the elections where all of a sudden right before the election we
[02:55:52.060 --> 02:55:58.100]  did an Osama bin Laden tape I guess the best thing I can say is to the people
[02:55:58.100 --> 02:56:02.980]  out there wake up and smell the coffee start paying attention a little bit
[02:56:02.980 --> 02:56:07.700]  more and start looking beyond the sound bite news for your answers but then
[02:56:07.700 --> 02:56:12.540]  again I'm on the Alex Jones show so essentially I'm preaching to the choir
[02:56:12.540 --> 02:56:17.260]  well we have a lot of new listeners governor are obviously no but so many
[02:56:17.260 --> 02:56:21.820]  don't listen to you Alex and so many don't listen beyond the sound bite news
[02:56:21.820 --> 02:56:27.060]  and it's it's those people we have to try to reach briefly tell us about the 9
[02:56:27.060 --> 02:56:32.620]  11 episode it's it's the Pentagon well the 9 11 episode the most exciting part
[02:56:32.620 --> 02:56:38.560]  of it will be that I speak to a woman who was right in there when when the
[02:56:38.560 --> 02:56:43.780]  alleged plane hit and you will hear an eyewitness account from someone who
[02:56:43.780 --> 02:56:48.500]  was right in there and she says some very startling things has this verified
[02:56:48.500 --> 02:56:54.700]  your suspicions oh yeah it's reaffirmed my yes very much so if they took it that
[02:56:54.700 --> 02:57:03.700]  way rather than the other way well I'm lost whenever you talk 9 11 long enough Alex eventually you
[02:57:03.700 --> 02:57:09.820]  start doubting yourself you start questioning yourself and when I speak
[02:57:09.820 --> 02:57:15.260]  to a woman who survived the Pentagon and was right in there and she reaffirms
[02:57:15.260 --> 02:57:22.380]  my my suspicions well that's good for me too I need that every now and then
[02:57:22.380 --> 02:57:26.100]  because it just seems you're out there fighting the unwinnable war and
[02:57:26.100 --> 02:57:31.140]  occasionally you need an ally but but clearly people are starting to wake up
[02:57:31.140 --> 02:57:34.220]  I mean not not not everybody but I mean I mean you've been around the country and
[02:57:34.220 --> 02:57:42.180]  I hope so but I but see wake up doesn't mean that the tea party well you know
[02:57:42.180 --> 02:57:48.100]  people need you know that's I don't know whether wake up is gonna take place I
[02:57:48.100 --> 02:57:53.500]  really don't but but hopefully people are starting to question more the things
[02:57:53.500 --> 02:58:00.180]  they're told and not just this self-blinded belief that they with our
[02:58:00.180 --> 02:58:05.540]  egos that the government can't lie to us that the government can be bad they
[02:58:05.540 --> 02:58:10.700]  can be because government is merely people and we need to lose the ego that
[02:58:10.700 --> 02:58:15.820]  to play possibly evil people can be elected to powerful positions you need
[02:58:15.820 --> 02:58:21.060]  only look at Germany in the 1930s to clearly understand that well the show's
