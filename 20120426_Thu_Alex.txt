[00:00.000 --> 00:12.360]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.360 --> 00:33.200]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:33.200 --> 00:40.600]  the news just gets crazier and weirder and more out of control by the millisecond
[00:40.600 --> 00:48.720]  if you go up to info wars.com on this Thursday edition you will see red-linked
[00:48.720 --> 00:56.800]  Russian troops to target terrorists in America as part of a drill and then I
[00:56.800 --> 01:02.520]  read into the article it's in the RIA Novostat that's the big government media
[01:02.520 --> 01:09.840]  of Russia it's in the Chinese news it's in all Chicago newspapers it's in
[01:09.840 --> 01:16.200]  mainstream news and then we have links to the New York Times admitting they're
[01:16.200 --> 01:21.720]  training Boy Scouts to take on disgruntled vets in the NLE09 exercise
[01:21.720 --> 01:27.240]  national level exercise 09 FEMA put out a press release saying troops from 15
[01:27.240 --> 01:33.680]  different nations were training to quote take on domestic terrorist and then
[01:33.680 --> 01:37.640]  there were other headlines that came out there were Congress asked generals
[01:37.640 --> 01:42.560]  about plan to use Mexican and Canadian troops against domestic extremists
[01:42.560 --> 01:48.280]  inside the US and that was even the Washington Post this is so crazy but
[01:48.280 --> 01:52.880]  it's not and again we got Senator Grassley saying our secret service wasn't
[01:52.880 --> 01:57.840]  infiltrated by hookers Russian spies and I'm like hey I don't want to be
[01:57.840 --> 02:01.080]  securely arrested I want the Bill of Rights you're probably a Russian spy
[02:01.080 --> 02:05.920]  hey the Russians work with the UN and the New World Order the globalist that's
[02:05.920 --> 02:08.920]  all part of the New World Order the megabanks are playing all the countries
[02:08.920 --> 02:12.840]  off against each other it's world government shut up Russian spy Jones
[02:12.840 --> 02:19.600]  why you were on Japanese TV once to you work for them meanwhile Russian troops
[02:19.600 --> 02:24.760]  now I remember a BBC article in fact Paul Watson has written this excellent
[02:24.760 --> 02:30.880]  article but I want him to dig up that BBC article from like what 2005 where
[02:30.880 --> 02:36.320]  Ukrainian troops were setting up real checkpoints in Scotland searching
[02:36.320 --> 02:41.120]  harassing people and it said the public was panicking they are really training us
[02:41.120 --> 02:47.200]  I mean I sent got to get that at it we have the video I sent Rob do and crew
[02:47.200 --> 02:50.920]  a year and a half ago to Chicago we got to cover this one out we knew tonight
[02:50.920 --> 02:56.440]  with a package of video and there were Dutch troops there were Czech
[02:56.440 --> 03:01.760]  Republic troops and Polish troops training with local police with American
[03:01.760 --> 03:06.520]  role-players to put Americans in camps there it is Ukraine Marines stop
[03:06.520 --> 03:12.240]  drivers BBC bam I want to beef Watson's article as hardcore as it is I want that
[03:12.240 --> 03:16.920]  in there print that for me too please you're watching on prison planet TV you're
[03:16.920 --> 03:21.560]  seeing this stuff come up live time I want to I want to send that over to
[03:21.560 --> 03:28.520]  Watson also when I have NLE09 added and I want to not snapping up my crew I'm
[03:28.520 --> 03:32.720]  snapping to make myself think I do that sometimes I also twiddle my fingers I
[03:32.720 --> 03:38.920]  think everybody does that the point is NLE09 key Washington Post article
[03:38.920 --> 03:46.200]  headline something like Congress asked generals to explain foreign troops to
[03:46.200 --> 03:52.200]  be deployed in U.S. something like that the point is it's all there and I've
[03:52.200 --> 03:58.240]  been to the urban warfare drills where they're training to take our guns here
[03:58.240 --> 04:04.440]  it is Kurt Nemo's article 2009 but again we have a link directly to the Washington
[04:04.440 --> 04:12.040]  Post on it and to the press release by FEMA and then here's the BBC right here
[04:12.040 --> 04:16.680]  I mean Ukrainian Marines stop drivers an apology has been issued to civilians
[04:16.680 --> 04:19.400]  caught up in the incident involving armed soldiers taking part in the NATO
[04:19.400 --> 04:24.040]  exercise in Southwest Scotland you know it's funny I've been to these drills
[04:24.040 --> 04:28.040]  where they go and then actually set up real checkpoints on the road and start
[04:28.040 --> 04:31.480]  pulling real people over going into neighborhoods and the Marines come over
[04:31.480 --> 04:36.960]  to us with their guns with the police and well in one case our camera guys the
[04:36.960 --> 04:40.760]  police detained them until the people explain you know this is America and
[04:40.760 --> 04:46.640]  basically the police chief was like not for long buddy I mean government is and
[04:46.640 --> 04:51.200]  they know our military is gonna rebel against this when they nuke Chicago the
[04:51.200 --> 04:55.040]  globalist to say patriots did it or the military confiscate guns they're gonna
[04:55.040 --> 05:01.240]  bring in spit stats I'm telling you Russian troops Chinese troops four five

[08:58.080 --> 09:02.240]  sure that we're energy dependent on the globalist and can't take care of
[09:02.240 --> 09:06.400]  ourselves and we have more oil than Saudi Arabia just in the lower 48 not to
[09:06.400 --> 09:14.080]  mention Alaska we have Obama in the New York Times Wall Street Journal and MSNBC

[10:22.040 --> 10:27.160]  months ago then 450 million rounds of hollow point 40 which which is they can
[10:27.160 --> 10:31.800]  launch a war with hundreds of armored mobile pill boxes for highway check
[10:31.800 --> 10:36.920]  points I saw Bill Clinton talk about that in the 98 but it's here TSA

[10:54.080 --> 11:01.920]  land and where do you stop they've got the big insurance companies I've got
[11:01.920 --> 11:06.800]  news on that the new American reporting on it today where basically you'll get a
[11:06.800 --> 11:12.320]  discount if you wire the new black boxes going in the cars that's in the map 21
[11:12.320 --> 11:17.960]  transportation bill that also has this UN passport bill in it and you'll get big
[11:17.960 --> 11:20.760]  discounts if you let them wire in and track where you go and what you do
[11:20.760 --> 11:24.640]  they're just priming the pump to get everybody ready for it to be mandatory
[11:24.640 --> 11:32.960]  where it's wired in to the augmented system that you put in your car and they
[11:32.960 --> 11:38.880]  admit all of this total control over every facet of our lives and Google
[11:38.880 --> 11:45.160]  says the plan is to then demonstrate that robot cars are safer that robot cars
[11:45.160 --> 11:52.680]  are safer than humans and so now humans aren't allowed to drive there's already
[11:52.680 --> 11:57.960]  robot cars in most states driving around robot 18 wheelers so that everything is
[11:57.960 --> 12:02.200]  automated surveilled and control we're letting the globalist who hate free
[12:02.200 --> 12:06.960]  humanity faves us out using our money and our energy when we purchase these
[12:06.960 --> 12:12.640]  products we're paying for all the spy tech tracking tech control tech added
[12:12.640 --> 12:16.120]  on to it and most technology experts we've interviewed like dr. Stahlman
[12:16.120 --> 12:21.840]  others have pointed out this is why the tech has so many glitches is because it's
[12:21.840 --> 12:29.120]  got so many backdoors and tracker systems added to it now this is our top
[12:29.120 --> 12:33.680]  story and we're just now twittering it out at twitter.com forward slash real
[12:33.680 --> 12:38.120]  Alex Jones will put that article on screen for people you cannot make this
[12:38.120 --> 12:42.600]  up let me read the article to you Russian troops to target terrorists in
[12:42.600 --> 12:49.440]  America as part of drill now this is hidden in plain view on Russian news
[12:49.440 --> 12:56.640]  Chinese news and US government announcements and a tiny blurb in another
[12:56.640 --> 13:04.880]  US publication but for all intents and purposes this is not broken yet Russian
[13:04.880 --> 13:10.200]  troops to target terrorists in America as part of drill now I'm gonna read the
[13:10.200 --> 13:17.960]  article but I want to explain something here's the BBC Ukrainian Marines stop
[13:17.960 --> 13:23.600]  drivers running checkpoints as part of NATO drill same thing here
[13:23.600 --> 13:28.120]  there's another one NLE09 FEMA takes preparations for martial law the next
[13:28.120 --> 13:33.320]  level April 21st 09 Kurt Nemo direct links to the FEMA press release where
[13:33.320 --> 13:38.120]  they state troops from 15 nations took part in preparations for fighting
[13:38.120 --> 13:43.440]  domestic terrorists in the United States go read it for yourself my point is
[13:43.440 --> 13:47.640]  I'm giving you the tip of the iceberg I have been to urban warfare drills all
[13:47.640 --> 13:53.160]  over the country and I've seen Australian I've seen Israeli I've seen
[13:53.160 --> 13:57.560]  French I've seen Dutch I've seen Polish I've seen Czech Republic I've seen
[13:57.560 --> 14:04.160]  British I've seen Scottish I've seen I've seen a lot of foreign troops I've
[14:04.160 --> 14:10.240]  seen Latin American troops training with with army with Marines to take on the
[14:10.240 --> 14:14.520]  American people and admitting in the role-playing that's what it's for and I
[14:14.520 --> 14:18.440]  get into the event and then an hour into it they'd have a plain clothes
[14:18.440 --> 14:23.200]  Marines show up freaking out going Alex Jones get out of here this is on tape
[14:23.200 --> 14:27.680]  it's in police state 2000 and I'm like but it's in Oakland California it's in
[14:27.680 --> 14:32.000]  this city I'm allowed to be here and they're like no you're not get out of
[14:32.000 --> 14:37.720]  here then I just would always have backup local reporters that I would send in as
[14:37.720 --> 14:42.560]  citizen observers and we got the footage of the Marines they take the young the
[14:42.560 --> 14:48.920]  the the the the youngest ones out there and train them that when they take the
[14:48.920 --> 14:52.480]  militia that surrendered out of the apartments they put them on their knees
[14:52.480 --> 14:56.920]  and they shoot them in the back of the head
[14:58.160 --> 15:02.600]  but by the way go to Paul Watson's new article on the Russians and click on the
[15:02.600 --> 15:06.440]  New York Times link because we do we do that all the time where it says I told
[15:06.440 --> 15:11.720]  you about this years before it was in the news Explorer scouts train to take on
[15:11.720 --> 15:16.160]  disgruntled vets and more the headline is they try to take on terrorists and
[15:16.160 --> 15:20.720]  more and the first line is they're killing roleplayers who are disgruntled

[15:30.760 --> 15:34.840]  in the article let me read the first line of the article for folks and I get
[15:34.840 --> 15:39.240]  calls going how dare you be against the Boy Scouts I love the Boy Scouts be
[15:39.240 --> 15:43.200]  honest be good be prepared be it's wonderful it's sick that it's being
[15:43.200 --> 15:48.880]  taken over ten let me read the first paragraph ten minutes into the errant
[15:48.880 --> 15:52.760]  mayhem in his town near the Mexican border and the gunman a disgruntled Iraq
[15:52.760 --> 15:56.160]  war veteran has already taken out two people one slumped on a desk the other
[15:56.160 --> 16:00.400]  covered in blood on the floor the responding officers 18 age boys and
[16:00.400 --> 16:05.720]  girls the youngest 14 face trip wire a thin cloud of poisonous gas and loud

[16:25.840 --> 16:34.240]  police officer and he was a commander and it said the number one enemy is vets
[16:34.240 --> 16:37.560]  vets are the enemy we're surveilling them we're watching them they either hire
[16:37.560 --> 16:43.360]  them to be cops or you're the enemy and they do a psychological test if you
[16:43.360 --> 16:48.200]  won't follow orders and are a veteran you are the number one enemy of the
[16:48.200 --> 16:53.280]  foreign banks that hijacked the country I'm gonna say this very simply foreign
[16:53.280 --> 17:00.040]  banks that want a global monopoly and hate the free market and who hate the
[17:00.040 --> 17:06.720]  individual population foreign global banks have taken over the federal
[17:06.720 --> 17:10.440]  government the national security system and now the NSA when Congress says let

[23:57.600 --> 24:12.840]  independence let me just briefly explain to everybody exactly what's going to
[24:12.840 --> 24:18.240]  happen here let's get a hold of this the globalists have created a high-tech
[24:18.240 --> 24:24.920]  control grid system that is phased in in upgrades that everyone clamors for and
[24:24.920 --> 24:30.200]  the whole thing is designed to disconnect humans from the land from
[24:30.200 --> 24:35.120]  reality where you can't work on your own car where everything's got surveillance
[24:35.120 --> 24:40.680]  tech built into it and finally where everything is automated and this
[24:40.680 --> 24:46.760]  process is not being done to empower you or because you're demanding it it is
[24:46.760 --> 24:52.120]  being done show that when they release the controlled bio weapons they can
[24:52.120 --> 24:57.160]  kill 80 to 90 percent that's the public numbers of the population in orderly
[24:57.160 --> 25:02.440]  fashion all the soft killing the increased cancers the diabetes the
[25:02.440 --> 25:06.640]  neurological disorders the toxins in our food and water all by design we even
[25:06.640 --> 25:11.000]  have the documents where they do it the 10,000 percent increase in cancer in
[25:11.000 --> 25:16.280]  children and different pediatric cancers all of that is just a background
[25:16.280 --> 25:22.960]  ambient warm-up that's why I'm fearless because it did there is no future if we
[25:22.960 --> 25:30.760]  don't stop these people now I have seen foreign trips from all over the world
[25:30.760 --> 25:38.800]  Latin America Europe Eastern Europe Australia New Zealand Israel train to
[25:38.800 --> 25:48.400]  take on the American people I have never seen Russians and the Russians are very
[25:48.400 --> 25:55.440]  excited about this and they are training to quote take on terrorist at a US
[25:55.440 --> 25:58.800]  military base now we've got the cooperative nugget footage from the
[25:58.800 --> 26:02.640]  early 90s with the general announces and down in Louisiana we are the forces of
[26:02.640 --> 26:06.160]  the New World Order we played those clips it's in my police state films and
[26:06.160 --> 26:10.800]  then it shows Eastern European former Soviet block troops training to take on
[26:10.800 --> 26:16.840]  Americans and then I went to very drills like that and people back in you
[26:16.840 --> 26:23.200]  know 97 98 99 2000 they thought it was fake oh there's no way those are real
[26:23.200 --> 26:26.680]  Marines training and saying on tape they're training to take on American
[26:26.680 --> 26:30.360]  gun owners there's no way I see them doing house-to-house gun confiscation
[26:30.360 --> 26:36.640]  drills in Oakland or Hebron Maryland Alex must have had a fake aircraft carrier
[26:36.640 --> 26:39.600]  the Coronado come up of course it was in the newspapers they were doing the
[26:39.600 --> 26:44.480]  drills and I show the news articles to thousands of Marines foreign troops my
[26:44.480 --> 26:47.320]  director friend Rick link letter you know actually heard people saying that
[26:47.320 --> 26:51.120]  about it because it was such a shocking film police day 2000 he said well
[26:51.120 --> 26:53.600]  number one he said I was out in California when that was happening Alex
[26:53.600 --> 27:00.800]  and number two that would cost 25 30 40 50 million to do that I mean now it's all
[27:00.800 --> 27:10.640]  admitted but people couldn't believe that it was happening and I don't blame
[27:10.640 --> 27:17.960]  them in a way Russian troops to target terrorists in America is part of drill
[27:17.960 --> 27:23.080]  it's being reported by the Russian state TV and print and the Chinese are very
[27:23.080 --> 27:27.400]  excited about it of course our government's given them the Panama Canal
[27:27.400 --> 27:34.920]  there are Mexican troops in Mexico there over 6,000 Chinese government front
[27:34.920 --> 27:38.560]  companies in the US but none of that's a threat though it's the militia and
[27:38.560 --> 27:43.240]  returning veterans the exercises which will mark the first time the respective
[27:43.240 --> 27:48.320]  countries to airborne forces have held joint drills on US territory will
[27:48.320 --> 27:53.720]  revolve around the reconnaissance of imaginary terrorist camp and raid and
[27:53.720 --> 27:57.960]  will also involve evacuations of the troops by helicopter the Russian
[27:57.960 --> 28:01.520]  soldiers will also be given access to US special services weapons at Fort
[28:01.520 --> 28:05.800]  Carson however the Russian troops won't just be confined to US military base
[28:05.800 --> 28:09.800]  on May 27th they'll be out in the local community hitting a baseball game in
[28:09.800 --> 28:13.400]  Colorado Springs just like they have troops at the Kentucky Derby the
[28:13.400 --> 28:16.760]  Super Bowl and I told you that was acclimation now the Kentucky Derby I was
[28:16.760 --> 28:22.240]  watching it last year at Waterloo ice house eating a chicken fried steak with
[28:22.240 --> 28:26.480]  my wife and children and my wife goes you know the Kentucky Derby look and I
[28:26.480 --> 28:30.920]  turn it's the end and people around the field they had troops with guns
[28:30.920 --> 28:35.840]  barrettas aiming them at people why couldn't you have state police when they
[28:35.840 --> 28:43.480]  run on the field do that no it had to be army with guns and so it's just part of
[28:43.480 --> 28:47.360]  the act when they admit it's part of the acclimation they have high school
[28:47.360 --> 28:51.360]  events all over the country now from New Mexico to Florida from Texas to New
[28:51.360 --> 28:55.400]  Jersey where little kids always see on the news are opening their hello kitty
[28:55.400 --> 29:00.160]  bag to be searched by the army and they pat them down just all the armies at the
[29:00.160 --> 29:05.920]  local football game but the borders wide open it's banker dawn it's banker
[29:05.920 --> 29:10.440]  dawn it's not red dawn it's banker dawn and again our own criminal banker run
[29:10.440 --> 29:15.080]  government try to start a war in Georgia with the Russians in four years ago in
[29:15.080 --> 29:20.640]  LA so there's lots of backstabbing going on and stuff here as well but the
[29:20.640 --> 29:24.800]  announcement comes at a time when the Russian actually has troops working
[29:24.800 --> 29:30.160]  cooperation with China points out business insider Eloise Lee making
[29:30.160 --> 29:34.000]  reference to one of the largest ever Russian Sino-Nable drills currently
[29:34.000 --> 29:39.040]  underway in the yellow sea openly for war with the US the Chinese president said
[29:39.040 --> 29:43.480]  two months ago okay there's more coming up and then I'm gonna give the number
[29:43.480 --> 29:47.200]  on you and all the other news but it's just all part of the twilight zoning of
[29:47.200 --> 29:55.480]  America we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN
[29:55.480 --> 30:03.240]  radio network this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider
[30:03.240 --> 30:07.560]  buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily
[30:07.560 --> 30:11.680]  double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants
[30:11.680 --> 30:15.600]  to control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true
[30:15.600 --> 30:19.240]  total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[30:19.240 --> 30:23.800]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[30:23.800 --> 30:28.440]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding
[30:28.440 --> 30:32.200]  the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids
[30:32.200 --> 30:35.640]  every year thousands of families lose their power from weather related
[30:35.640 --> 30:39.560]  damages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup

[33:39.880 --> 33:45.840]  each other to distract and divert and impoverish this is all openly stated
[33:45.840 --> 33:50.040]  and now they're openly announcing their world government their new agenda 21
[33:50.040 --> 33:55.560]  covered by the environmental movement to shut down industry and individual
[33:55.560 --> 34:02.160]  liberty private property it's all being announced the rural council Pentagon

[34:39.440 --> 34:44.400]  misappropriate and and and charge them under something else this is total
[34:44.400 --> 34:50.840]  lawless government and I just keep repeating that this is a made a situation
[34:50.840 --> 34:56.520]  and people have woken up under Obama but when Mitt Romney gets in there which
[34:56.520 --> 35:03.400]  could happen you're gonna see so many conservatives and libertarians just go
[35:03.400 --> 35:08.080]  to sleep because Romney and the Democrats will have a fake fight with each
[35:08.080 --> 35:13.360]  other and the discredited MSNBC will attack Romney well if they're attacking
[35:13.360 --> 35:20.560]  Romney then he must be good and he will take on all of these tyrannical actions
[35:20.560 --> 35:25.120]  and expand them he again has admitted that he wants to ban semi-autos he
[35:25.120 --> 35:29.720]  supports carbon taxes he supported government-run health care now he
[35:29.720 --> 35:33.280]  claims he doesn't support that but mark my words and people say well then what
[35:33.280 --> 35:38.000]  do we do keep Obama in there mark Moreno who's advised Congress and work
[35:38.000 --> 35:42.960]  center in off he agrees he says it would be better for this country if Obama
[35:42.960 --> 35:47.480]  stayed in because he's hated his approval rating plunges and plunges and as he
[35:47.480 --> 35:52.800]  tries to grab dictatorial power people are gonna resist him but in comes Romney
[35:52.800 --> 35:56.720]  that's why he's getting more money now than Obama from the big banks in comes
[35:56.720 --> 36:02.480]  Romney he'll have a couple years of time to con people and to continue all the
[36:02.480 --> 36:09.560]  events now I got to tell you personally I don't find Romney as nasty or you know
[36:09.560 --> 36:17.880]  wicked as Obama but I assure you I'll learn to low them as you will and all
[36:17.880 --> 36:22.160]  the so-called left will suddenly get mad at torture and secret arrest and
[36:22.160 --> 36:28.160]  warrantless wiretapping if Romney gets in they'll suddenly get real moral but
[36:28.160 --> 36:31.000]  they're the ones cheerleading Obama and saying they don't care I mean it's just
[36:31.000 --> 36:35.480]  it's such a game like my guys in there so I supporting and it's gonna be the
[36:35.480 --> 36:42.880]  same thing with with Romney that we saw with Obama and it's such a parlor trick
[36:42.880 --> 36:47.120]  but it doesn't work now people wake up in six months not two or three years now
[36:47.120 --> 36:50.720]  so time's running out for the globalist that's why they're trying to just
[36:50.720 --> 36:58.480]  totally overwhelm us right now Russian troops to target terrorists in America
[36:58.480 --> 37:02.840]  as part of drill and then we've got in le09 we've got this happening in the
[37:02.840 --> 37:07.280]  European countries they've got foreign troops in Australia New Zealand I was
[37:07.280 --> 37:11.360]  reading in fact guys I forgot to send this to you I was reading it last night
[37:11.360 --> 37:19.600]  and my I am crash so I didn't send it to you it was in Sydney Morning Herald or
[37:19.600 --> 37:23.000]  not I follow a link from there to the age I can't remember which newspaper I
[37:23.000 --> 37:32.720]  was on just type in Australia setting up its own TSA and it's modeled after it
[37:32.720 --> 37:35.880]  it's exactly the same naked body scanners and it was how they were
[37:35.880 --> 37:40.000]  hiring and running ads and it's global standardization and it'll be the
[37:40.000 --> 37:43.960]  airports first everybody'll get upset it's designed to get you upset then it
[37:43.960 --> 37:47.920]  will be the highways then it'll be the street corners and they're gonna say oh
[37:47.920 --> 37:52.160]  we'll just face scan you now to prove you're good and they're already
[37:52.160 --> 37:57.320]  announcing that oh the answer is you'll be approved for travel through this
[37:57.320 --> 38:01.800]  traveler card and people will be like good let me have the travel card but
[38:01.800 --> 38:05.480]  wait if you read what Homeland Security says they're gonna sell you on the
[38:05.480 --> 38:10.300]  travel card but you still may be singled out that their single be three
[38:10.300 --> 38:15.280]  avenues total groping strip searching interrogation member of Congress from
[38:15.280 --> 38:18.760]  San Antonio was in mainstream news yesterday saying they know who he is
[38:18.760 --> 38:23.600]  they single him out they know he's criticized TSA so they have the police
[38:23.600 --> 38:30.200]  there to threaten to arrest the congressman this was in the news yesterday
[38:30.840 --> 38:37.680]  if he doesn't stand there and let them squeeze and hurt him and and and and
[38:37.680 --> 38:46.400]  well you call it racking someone in fact guys what congressman was that his
[38:46.400 --> 38:52.160]  name does not Conceco yeah yeah yeah I mean I want him on I want him on Ron
[38:52.160 --> 38:57.560]  Paul talked about it Ventura's talked about it I mean they they don't do it to
[38:57.560 --> 39:04.200]  everybody it's like a it's certain perverts usually the supervisors look
[39:04.200 --> 39:07.000]  they're just getting you ready to put their hands on you and disappear you when
[39:07.000 --> 39:14.280]  Rob do got arrested at the g20 peacefully covering things on tape they came and
[39:14.280 --> 39:17.160]  said okay you're with mainstream media you're not you're arrested and they put
[39:17.160 --> 39:20.760]  him out in the rain all night at an army base with troops walking around with
[39:20.760 --> 39:23.920]  police and black uniforms and they were driving in with a lot of people with
[39:23.920 --> 39:33.000]  bags over their heads I mean this this is a this is authoritarianism I told you
[39:33.000 --> 39:36.720]  15 years ago they were black mass to intimidate you and to cover their
[39:36.720 --> 39:40.360]  identity I mean like executioners do like the foxes the elite police in
[39:40.360 --> 39:45.640]  Mexico have for 70 years and now we've had police chiefs and manuals go public
[39:45.640 --> 39:49.520]  where they admit you just type in police chief admits they were black mass to
[39:49.520 --> 39:53.880]  intimidate and they say yeah we want to intimidate the public that's the shift
[39:53.880 --> 39:57.640]  is they want to intimidate the public now you got more sophisticated people
[39:57.640 --> 40:01.160]  like Chief Art Acevedo in Austin who wants to go back to old-fashioned
[40:01.160 --> 40:06.640]  uniforms nostalgia old-fashioned police cars but push a bunch of police state
[40:06.640 --> 40:12.640]  stuff so real smiley real slick real friendly oh we're here to help you and
[40:12.640 --> 40:21.280]  maybe he drinks his own Kool-Aid but he does a lot unconstitutional stuff but
[40:21.280 --> 40:24.120]  whether they're in the old-fashioned police uniform of the modern we're
[40:24.120 --> 40:32.200]  gonna intimidate you when you're not in Kansas I'm not in Kansas anymore and now
[40:32.200 --> 40:38.560]  they're sending out their microwave guns to the tea parties to intimidate
[40:38.560 --> 40:46.480]  people and their sound cannons and why because they're getting ready to implode
[40:46.480 --> 40:50.520]  the economy they want a new dark age in their own words before I continue with
[40:50.520 --> 40:55.440]  the article about Russian troops that target Americans before I get into Paul
[40:55.440 --> 40:59.080]  Watson's article at prisonplanet.com and infowars.com I just
[40:59.080 --> 41:08.880]  twittered during the last break a article by an amazing writer there on our
[41:08.880 --> 41:15.040]  site and I'm always really bad at pronouncing names always want to plug
[41:15.040 --> 41:17.680]  this guy but then I'm always too ignorant and too slow to get one of my
[41:17.680 --> 41:21.720]  crew knows I'd actually pronounce things right to tell me cuz you know I've got a
[41:21.720 --> 41:29.200]  lot of gifts but I'm missing some things it's Saman Mohamedi I believe you
[41:29.200 --> 41:33.240]  pronounce it writes amazing articles almost every day for us and it says the
[41:33.240 --> 41:42.200]  global war on heritage nationalism nature cultures history and humanity let me
[41:42.200 --> 41:44.840]  read these quotes he begins his articles with it really like how he does his
[41:44.840 --> 41:50.000]  articles once again prosperous and successful crime goes by the name of
[41:50.000 --> 41:59.840]  virtue good men obey the bad might is right and fear oppresses law and that's
[41:59.840 --> 42:06.440]  Seneca the younger the madness of Hercules here's another one unjust rule
[42:06.440 --> 42:17.280]  never abides continually that's Seneca the younger and they know that the
[42:17.280 --> 42:19.840]  unjust know that's what they're trying to use technology what they call the
[42:19.840 --> 42:23.400]  final revolution where they say in their own words so those of us that are like
[42:23.400 --> 42:32.080]  ravenous wolves those of us are the beast men can have our way with the
[42:32.080 --> 42:37.200]  population and they it's in all their literature we are the true humans we
[42:37.200 --> 42:41.600]  don't have their morals we love to dominate and control and stomp and
[42:41.600 --> 42:45.000]  trample and be trampled and with this technological revolution the final
[42:45.000 --> 42:49.360]  revolution we will finally exterminate the original human system and rebuild it
[42:49.360 --> 42:53.160]  whatever image we want and that image means blowing the planet up out of sure
[42:53.160 --> 42:58.920]  willingness and nihilistic pleasure and so be it we will destroy earth I've got
[42:58.920 --> 43:03.160]  top futurist and globalist with those quotes I was paraphrasing an in-game
[43:03.160 --> 43:08.680]  linen wrote poetry about that they all talk about and then we'll blow the earth
[43:08.680 --> 43:14.560]  up you're like why they're like because you know why we're just like yeah because
[43:14.560 --> 43:19.680]  you should have cast for the role in the exorcist that's why because there's
[43:19.680 --> 43:25.480]  something dark manifesting in you and again if you don't believe in spiritual
[43:25.480 --> 43:34.000]  entities whatever might as well be I mean why why would Stalin and linen it's
[43:34.000 --> 43:38.440]  it's been released by the Russians in the last few decades where the NKVD
[43:38.440 --> 43:41.160]  would come out and say aren't we've been imprisoned or killed half this town
[43:41.160 --> 43:45.200]  everyone's submitting doing exactly as they're told what do you want and and
[43:45.200 --> 43:54.360]  linen would cry and write it more blood more terror kill and linen that's where
[43:54.360 --> 43:58.680]  in that Clint Eastwood movie what's the name of the Clint Eastwood movie with the
[43:58.680 --> 44:02.920]  crazy guys on the side of the highway shooting rabbits he has a trunkload of
[44:02.920 --> 44:06.080]  rabbits and he's running around crazily with a shotgun shooting the rabbits
[44:06.080 --> 44:11.480]  one that's got Jeff Bridges in it Jeff Bridges Clint Eastwood will take the
[44:11.480 --> 44:15.640]  name of the movie it's a great movie I always thought that was something Clint
[44:15.640 --> 44:22.440]  Eastwood because I he wrote that the memory serves I always thought he just
[44:22.440 --> 44:25.800]  made that up and I was like man Clint Eastwood came up with that no that's
[44:25.800 --> 44:34.120]  what linen would do thunderbolt and lightfoot yeah about bank robbers and
[44:34.120 --> 44:38.360]  that's what linen would do but he would have them deliver little white rabbits
[44:38.360 --> 44:42.760]  to this island and he would run around shooting them hacking them abiding them
[44:42.760 --> 44:48.400]  and of course he had a syphilitic brain as well it turned out but folks if you're
[44:48.400 --> 44:52.440]  a new listener my crew in there will sit there and type in whatever I'm saying
[44:52.440 --> 44:55.960]  they found mainstream articles about Nero dressing up like a werewolf and
[44:55.960 --> 44:59.720]  raping and murdering children in public in Rome I'm not making this stuff up
[44:59.720 --> 45:02.840]  occasionally we get stuff wrong we're the first to admit it and here is a
[45:02.840 --> 45:06.600]  correction by the way thank God it's a correction I'm glad something you know
[45:06.600 --> 45:10.400]  horrible that we're reading about isn't confirmed now the new American did an
[45:10.400 --> 45:14.000]  analysis and found well it could be used to block the transport of guns period
[45:14.000 --> 45:17.600]  because it allows arbitrarily the pulling of any permit they want in
[45:17.600 --> 45:21.960]  transportation without law or due process so it is a horrible police state
[45:21.960 --> 45:26.400]  bill and Joel Scousins the one that first alerted us to it that the article
[45:26.400 --> 45:31.000]  that we posted by another writer was not correct the IRS is not saying outside
[45:31.000 --> 45:35.200]  of law they will confiscate your firearms though we're on a manual saying that
[45:35.200 --> 45:38.520]  and so that's why we gave it credence it was a misinterpretation and we
[45:38.520 --> 45:43.720]  corrected that to what we put a blurb above the article we'd linked to I wish
[45:43.720 --> 45:49.680]  that this information was not accurate I mean I wish they weren't confirming
[45:49.680 --> 45:54.080]  they're going to ban children doing chores on farms killing the family farm
[45:54.080 --> 45:57.080]  that's the backbone of it killed children involved learning how to do it
[45:57.080 --> 46:02.320]  it's over and next started on this in Europe parents can't tell their kids to
[46:02.320 --> 46:07.440]  beat us do chores they want you totally screwed up ready for the new robotic
[46:07.440 --> 46:10.320]  environment to come in where everything's done for you you're basically a
[46:10.320 --> 46:16.860]  wirehead in the matrix ahead of the Superbile releases it's all public
[46:16.860 --> 46:20.360]  Rockefeller Foundation that's how I know all this and we link to it all the
[46:20.360 --> 46:25.120]  time we have writers that link to it it's all happening continuing with his
[46:25.120 --> 46:32.160]  article starts with quotes here is perhaps the most striking irony of the
[46:32.160 --> 46:39.200]  life of Antichrist filled as it is with perverse opponents to the life of the
[46:39.200 --> 46:45.480]  Messiah the demonic has its own form of incarnation bestial not human and with
[46:45.480 --> 46:51.280]  the object of securing man's subjugation rather than his liberation his
[46:51.280 --> 46:57.720]  death rather than his life this preoccupation with domination and death
[46:57.720 --> 47:08.880]  is of the essence of hell you read that again that was Roland Moushat fry God
[47:08.880 --> 47:12.920]  man and Satan patterns of Christian thought and life in paradise lost
[47:12.920 --> 47:18.080]  pilgrims progress and the great theologians Princeton University Princeton
[47:18.080 --> 47:23.960]  New Jersey 1960 page 39 let me read that again to you because this is of the
[47:23.960 --> 47:27.600]  essence right here this is kill steal and destroy you know why they do this
[47:27.600 --> 47:31.880]  because it's beautiful to them by the way Jacobson did find it last week on
[47:31.880 --> 47:37.040]  his own from six seven years ago we found the Schwarzenegger photos online we
[47:37.040 --> 47:42.240]  stumbled across of him in Austria I was wrong it wasn't Germany at a art house
[47:42.240 --> 47:47.840]  privately buying art of images of dead babies and saying how beautiful it is
[47:47.840 --> 47:54.520]  so let's do a news piece on that soon we found it doesn't matter look at the
[47:54.520 --> 47:59.720]  New York Times all the top-selling art now is goblets of pus and maggots and
[47:59.720 --> 48:07.720]  skulls you're like what was a dead buzzard in my backyard I live on a few
[48:07.720 --> 48:11.320]  acres you know walk I saw this dead buzzard it's still nothing will eat it
[48:11.320 --> 48:14.560]  the carrion creatures won't eat it so it's like a month later it's still
[48:14.560 --> 48:20.480]  stinking I mean why is that beautiful but see I'm not totally screwed up I
[48:20.480 --> 48:25.600]  can look into their mindset though that's why sometimes I illustrate their
[48:25.600 --> 48:33.840]  spirit and show you what they think of you not so much channeling it but just
[48:33.840 --> 48:40.600]  giving you a mirror image a glimpse a tiny glimpse I've studied the enemy so
[48:40.600 --> 48:44.480]  long careful that you do not look too long to the abyss at least you become the
[48:44.480 --> 48:49.000]  abyss I've got to remember that every day
[48:52.200 --> 48:58.040]  here is perhaps the most striking irony of the life of Antichrist filled as it
[48:58.040 --> 49:03.320]  is with perverse opponents to the life of the Messiah the demonic has its own
[49:03.320 --> 49:08.040]  form of incarnation bestial not human and with the object of securing man's
[49:08.040 --> 49:13.480]  subjugation rather than his liberation his death rather than his life this
[49:13.480 --> 49:25.360]  preoccupation with domination and death is of the essence of hell Roland frying
[49:25.360 --> 49:30.240]  then it has quotes my quotes here humanity is under attack declared
[49:30.240 --> 49:36.080]  Alex Jones in December 2008 I know there is a lot of people out there that try to
[49:36.080 --> 49:41.680]  deny the issue we cover here out of fear he said because there are real monsters
[49:41.680 --> 49:46.120]  in this world and they control the heights above us they introduced the
[49:46.120 --> 49:49.880]  poisons into the food supply the water we drink the air we breathe they are
[49:49.880 --> 49:56.800]  releasing plagues upon the earth they are drunk on the blood of billions and it
[49:56.800 --> 50:03.840]  just goes on where he has quote after quote after quote here a very powerful
[50:03.840 --> 50:08.400]  researcher and writer read it at prison planet calm and in full wars calm and we

[50:13.920 --> 50:19.880]  us there well that's my fault because I never really plug it properly we need to

[01:01:14.240 --> 01:01:18.520]  answer is stop buying any of this big corporate stuff fight fire with fire

[01:01:23.120 --> 01:01:27.040]  the few votes we got left is the money they can cheat elections they can do

[01:01:31.240 --> 01:01:36.360]  submission well in my mind I think it's gonna backfire on them Mark in Texas

[01:01:39.680 --> 01:01:45.960]  very good to be on you're a difficult guy to get a hold of I only have just got a
[01:01:45.960 --> 01:01:50.760]  general statement to make guys I was away from my radio for a while but I will
[01:01:50.760 --> 01:01:59.920]  say this based on the comments that I see are you hands-free on your phone no I
[01:01:59.920 --> 01:02:04.080]  am not I'm actually trying to break the wind from where I that's rough one okay
[01:02:04.080 --> 01:02:08.080]  it's rough one real bad go ahead make your point anyway the point is based on
[01:02:08.080 --> 01:02:12.960]  the comments that I'm reading out there in the news there are a great deal great
[01:02:12.960 --> 01:02:18.400]  many people very aware of these things and I find that very encouraging and I
[01:02:18.400 --> 01:02:20.920]  share your sentiment I don't think these people are going to get away with what
[01:02:20.920 --> 01:02:24.400]  they're doing I think it's that I could state how outrageous it is but that
[01:02:24.400 --> 01:02:27.600]  would be overstate the obvious but I also wanted to just take the
[01:02:27.600 --> 01:02:32.360]  opportunity since I have for a long time tried to get into this show and just
[01:02:32.360 --> 01:02:38.440]  express to you my personal thanks I've been listening and watching you from way
[01:02:38.440 --> 01:02:43.320]  in the beginning brother and I'm really pleased with your progress and I'm
[01:02:43.320 --> 01:02:48.040]  pleased with the with the results of your efforts and you do not stand alone
[01:02:48.040 --> 01:02:52.920]  when it comes to speaking the truth and sharing it willingly and unafraid so
[01:02:52.920 --> 01:02:56.680]  thank you well thank you what do you make of the announcements that they're
[01:02:56.680 --> 01:03:01.280]  having Russian troops to target terrorists in America as part of drill
[01:03:01.280 --> 01:03:07.000]  and this is mainstream news they're very very proud of it well obviously this is
[01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:12.280]  a very troubling this is almost like you're gonna wake up at some point and
[01:03:12.280 --> 01:03:19.000]  you're gonna you're gonna hope to wake up from a very bad strange twisted dream
[01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:24.000]  is it that what's happened in all these other countries Cambodia Cuba Russia
[01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:28.200]  China Eastern Europe all over Latin America all over Asia this is how the
[01:03:28.200 --> 01:03:32.080]  rest of the world lives our forebears weren't perfect but they fought to have
[01:03:32.080 --> 01:03:36.300]  rule of law to keep government small and to defend individual liberty you get
[01:03:36.300 --> 01:03:40.880]  rid of that you're in a world of hurt right and we are as I think you've said
[01:03:40.880 --> 01:03:45.920]  before in the past and it's certainly true we we stated an exception to the
[01:03:45.920 --> 01:03:52.920]  rule or we did we're we're sliding ever so quickly into becoming the rule of the
[01:03:52.920 --> 01:03:59.120]  rest of the world and I doubt frankly that that will be successful I just
[01:03:59.120 --> 01:04:03.840]  don't look forward to the types of things that will be necessary to keep
[01:04:03.840 --> 01:04:08.040]  that from happening and I certainly hope I'm wrong about that but well God
[01:04:08.040 --> 01:04:12.840]  bless you my friend how long you've been watching or listening to the show oh

[01:04:35.920 --> 01:04:39.880]  to believe things are gonna get better but they're not Ron Paul really won the
[01:04:39.880 --> 01:04:43.360]  first stage he was the guy he could have been our president we could have
[01:04:43.360 --> 01:04:46.840]  reversed it but the criminals who've been caught committing thousands of other

[01:08:01.480 --> 01:08:14.480]  music
[01:08:14.480 --> 01:08:17.480]  get your motor around
[01:08:17.480 --> 01:08:24.360]  head on the highway looking for freedom looking for adventure in whatever comes
[01:08:24.360 --> 01:08:29.360]  Yeah, nothing's gonna make it happen.
[01:08:29.360 --> 01:08:41.800]  Thank you so much for joining us, it is the 26th day of April 2012 and we are continuing
[01:08:41.800 --> 01:08:45.560]  with your phone calls and the news coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[01:08:45.560 --> 01:08:50.840]  I'm gonna play for the first time here on air some of the incredible entries that we're
[01:08:50.840 --> 01:08:58.640]  getting now, more than 20 a day, by InfoWars listeners who are taking part in the $10,000
[01:08:58.640 --> 01:09:04.280]  cash prize contest to be in the running to be chosen to work here in Austin, Texas at
[01:09:04.280 --> 01:09:09.440]  the InfoWars radio slash TV slash film web system.
[01:09:09.440 --> 01:09:13.400]  We're looking for reporters for the nightly news, radio, you name it, one female, one
[01:09:13.400 --> 01:09:20.800]  male, $5,000 each, whoever wins then is in the running, if it all works out to be reporters.
[01:09:20.800 --> 01:09:24.320]  But I think we're also gonna end up having some correspondence, there's just too many
[01:09:24.320 --> 01:09:25.320]  good people.
[01:09:25.320 --> 01:09:30.400]  Then I have to budget out whether it'll be consideration for people's sites or their
[01:09:30.400 --> 01:09:35.160]  own news systems, then being reporters for us, correspondence, then they're trying to
[01:09:35.160 --> 01:09:38.000]  organize that, then there's the management of that.
[01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:44.280]  But we've got like 500 or more incredible entries and we have been trying to watch them
[01:09:44.280 --> 01:09:49.160]  every day and trying to keep track of them, it's gonna take at least a month when this
[01:09:49.160 --> 01:09:54.560]  month ends, you've got until the end of the month to get your video into us.
[01:09:54.560 --> 01:09:58.440]  There's banners on the right hand side of infowars.com to take part in the contest.
[01:09:58.440 --> 01:10:02.480]  You can just link through there and find out all the rules and where to send them and then
[01:10:02.480 --> 01:10:05.200]  see all the entries.
[01:10:05.200 --> 01:10:08.640]  And then we're gonna have to go through these and try to choose who the winners are.
[01:10:08.640 --> 01:10:10.680]  This is gonna be hard.
[01:10:10.680 --> 01:10:14.720]  But I think the second, third and fourth places, though we didn't have those places, you just
[01:10:14.720 --> 01:10:18.160]  got one male winner, one female winner, we're looking for male and female reporter, two
[01:10:18.160 --> 01:10:22.600]  of them will be that they'll be more than one winner when it comes to actually working
[01:10:22.600 --> 01:10:26.920]  with us and being correspondents because a lot of people actually gave us this idea.
[01:10:26.920 --> 01:10:33.560]  They said, look, I don't want to move from Seattle or New York or Miami or Dallas or
[01:10:33.560 --> 01:10:38.840]  wherever Minneapolis, St. Paul, Chicago, Kansas City.
[01:10:38.840 --> 01:10:43.160]  I don't want to move from where I live, but I'd like to do reports for you once a week,
[01:10:43.160 --> 01:10:44.640]  once a day, once a month.
[01:10:44.640 --> 01:10:47.160]  Hey, knock yourselves out.
[01:10:47.160 --> 01:10:48.160]  This is awesome.
[01:10:48.160 --> 01:10:51.080]  Be in Fall Wars correspondents out there.
[01:10:51.080 --> 01:10:55.080]  Very, very exciting what's happening because this, I was really just looking for that native
[01:10:55.080 --> 01:10:56.080]  talent out there.
[01:10:56.080 --> 01:10:58.320]  This has turned into something a lot bigger.
[01:10:58.320 --> 01:11:04.000]  So that's coming up with Rob Do and continuing with calls into the third hour here today.
[01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:05.000]  Here's some of the crazy news.
[01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:06.560]  Let me just mention it before I go back to your calls.
[01:11:06.560 --> 01:11:11.600]  Coming up, Russian troops to target terrorists in America is part of drill, joint U.S. Russian
[01:11:11.600 --> 01:11:14.120]  anti-terror exercise, stokes, fears of martial law.
[01:11:14.120 --> 01:11:18.000]  Paul Joseph Watson in full Wars.com and he's got links to mainstream news.
[01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:21.000]  This is, this is in the news like, oh yeah, the Russians are trying to fight us with the
[01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:22.000]  government.
[01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:25.480]  Well, yeah, the bankers will use anybody they can.
[01:11:25.480 --> 01:11:26.840]  It's banker Don.
[01:11:26.840 --> 01:11:34.440]  It's been Bernanke Don EU calls for Russian airborne troops to take U.S. calls for Russian
[01:11:34.440 --> 01:11:38.360]  airborne troops to take and hold in for airport.
[01:11:38.360 --> 01:11:40.160]  That's a article here.
[01:11:40.160 --> 01:11:46.280]  But I also have, I have my, where's my BBC article?
[01:11:46.280 --> 01:11:52.720]  That's the one I was talking about where the NATO troops took over, yeah, in Scotland.
[01:11:52.720 --> 01:11:53.840]  We'll just put that back on screen.
[01:11:53.840 --> 01:12:00.600]  I guess I gave it to do and I have that added to Paul Joseph Watson's articles.
[01:12:00.600 --> 01:12:01.600]  Thank you, sir.
[01:12:01.600 --> 01:12:02.600]  There it is.
[01:12:02.600 --> 01:12:08.320]  Ukrainian Marines, stop drivers in Scotland, BBC, NLE09 FEMA takes preparation for martial
[01:12:08.320 --> 01:12:09.320]  law to next level.
[01:12:09.320 --> 01:12:13.040]  I mean, that's the type of headlines here.
[01:12:13.040 --> 01:12:16.840]  That is the type of bizarro craziness that we're dealing with, but there is some good
[01:12:16.840 --> 01:12:17.840]  news.
[01:12:17.840 --> 01:12:19.320]  Now, multiple states have done this.
[01:12:19.320 --> 01:12:26.680]  This is from the new American, perhaps prodded by Virginia's success in passing a law preventing
[01:12:26.680 --> 01:12:30.440]  the federal government from apprehending and indefinitely detaining citizens of the state
[01:12:30.440 --> 01:12:32.520]  without charge, just disappearing you.
[01:12:32.520 --> 01:12:33.520]  Where'd Bob go?
[01:12:33.520 --> 01:12:34.520]  Well, you know where he went.
[01:12:34.520 --> 01:12:35.520]  Don't talk about it.
[01:12:35.520 --> 01:12:36.520]  He'll be next.
[01:12:36.520 --> 01:12:42.780]  The legislature of Arizona on Tuesday passed its own anti-NDAA bill.
[01:12:42.780 --> 01:12:43.780]  Very exciting.
[01:12:43.780 --> 01:12:45.280]  Get to that more later.
[01:12:45.280 --> 01:12:48.080]  Meanwhile, here's MSNBC.
[01:12:48.080 --> 01:12:49.520]  Obama can't hardly wait.
[01:12:49.520 --> 01:12:53.800]  The New York Times examines how Obama is using his executive powers as he faces a Congress
[01:12:53.800 --> 01:12:55.040]  blocking many of his initiatives.
[01:12:55.040 --> 01:12:58.680]  And it goes on to say he can't wait to totally ignore Congress.
[01:12:58.680 --> 01:13:01.320]  He's going to legalize the illegals, the article says.
[01:13:01.320 --> 01:13:04.560]  He's going to pass gun restriction laws.
[01:13:04.560 --> 01:13:06.720]  He's going to shut down more power plants.
[01:13:06.720 --> 01:13:10.720]  He's going to ship more jobs to China, paying with taxpayer money to move General Motors
[01:13:10.720 --> 01:13:12.840]  to China.
[01:13:12.840 --> 01:13:13.840]  I'm not joking.
[01:13:13.840 --> 01:13:14.840]  That's Detroit Free Press.
[01:13:14.840 --> 01:13:17.840]  I mean, whoa, Twilight Zone.
[01:13:17.840 --> 01:13:21.240]  I mean, I just cannot believe how fast this is moving.
[01:13:21.240 --> 01:13:29.200]  Meanwhile, Bernanke is now saying they may raise interest rates in 2013 or 2014, but he
[01:13:29.200 --> 01:13:31.960]  says the economy's doing great.
[01:13:31.960 --> 01:13:34.840]  But while talking to Congress, he's sung another tune.
[01:13:34.840 --> 01:13:36.240]  For the bankers, it is going great.
[01:13:36.240 --> 01:13:40.840]  They are really destroying things to consolidate anti-free market cronies.
[01:13:40.840 --> 01:13:41.840]  Look at this.
[01:13:41.840 --> 01:13:42.840]  This is CNS News.
[01:13:42.840 --> 01:13:43.840]  We're going to play this clip in a moment.
[01:13:43.840 --> 01:13:49.880]  Bernanke points to increased possibility of sudden financial crisis.
[01:13:49.880 --> 01:13:54.760]  Bernanke said that while nobody knows, really, your, I mean, and Starmark is totally rigged.
[01:13:54.760 --> 01:13:56.040]  That's even in the news today.
[01:13:56.040 --> 01:14:00.440]  When a financial crisis will come, it surely ever closer.
[01:14:00.440 --> 01:14:05.160]  And remember, they engineered the crisis in 08, demanding unlimited trillions.
[01:14:05.160 --> 01:14:14.120]  So let's go ahead and play a clip of Lord Bernanke telling Congress this.
[01:14:14.120 --> 01:14:17.800]  Here it is.
[01:14:17.800 --> 01:14:25.600]  Okay, our computer had a heart attack.
[01:14:25.600 --> 01:14:44.560]  A highlight.
[01:14:44.560 --> 01:14:48.160]  economy is then close to full employment.
[01:14:48.160 --> 01:14:52.440]  Of even greater concern is that longer-run projections based on plausible assumptions
[01:14:52.440 --> 01:14:57.360]  about the evolution of the economy and the budget under current policies show the structural
[01:14:57.360 --> 01:15:02.200]  budget gap increasing significantly further over time and the ratio of outstanding federal
[01:15:02.200 --> 01:15:05.120]  debt to GDP rising rapidly.
[01:15:05.120 --> 01:15:09.000]  This dynamic is clearly unsustainable.
[01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:11.920]  These structural fiscal imbalances did not emerge overnight.
[01:15:11.920 --> 01:15:16.980]  To a significant extent, they are the result of an aging population and especially fast-rising
[01:15:16.980 --> 01:15:21.360]  health care costs, both of which have been predicted for decades.
[01:15:21.360 --> 01:15:25.760]  Notably the CBO projects that net federal outlays for health care entitlements, which
[01:15:25.760 --> 01:15:34.160]  were about 5% of GDP in fiscal 2011, could rise to more than 9% of GDP by 2035.
[01:15:34.160 --> 01:15:37.640]  Although we have been warned about such developments for many years, the time when projections
[01:15:37.640 --> 01:15:41.560]  should become reality is coming closer.
[01:15:41.560 --> 01:15:45.360]  In a large and increasing level of government debt, relative to national income runs the
[01:15:45.360 --> 01:15:49.360]  risk of serious economic consequences.
[01:15:49.360 --> 01:15:53.400]  Over the long term, the current trajectory of federal debt threatens to crowd out private
[01:15:53.400 --> 01:15:57.560]  capital formation and thus reduce productivity growth.
[01:15:57.560 --> 01:16:01.200]  To the extent that increasing debt is financed by borrowing from abroad, a growing share
[01:16:01.200 --> 01:16:07.280]  of our future income would be devoted to interest payments on foreign-held federal debt.
[01:16:07.280 --> 01:16:11.080]  High levels of debt also impair the ability of policymakers to respond effectively to
[01:16:11.080 --> 01:16:16.040]  future economic shocks and other adverse events.
[01:16:16.040 --> 01:16:20.640]  Even the prospect of unsustainable deficits has costs, including an increased possibility
[01:16:20.640 --> 01:16:23.280]  of a sudden fiscal crisis.
[01:16:23.280 --> 01:16:27.080]  As we have seen in a number of countries recently, interest rates can soar quickly if investors
[01:16:27.080 --> 01:16:32.240]  lose confidence in the ability of a government to manage its fiscal policy.
[01:16:32.240 --> 01:16:36.520]  Although historical experience and economic theory do not indicate the exact threshold
[01:16:36.520 --> 01:16:41.400]  at which the perceived risks associated with the U.S. public debt would increase markedly,
[01:16:41.400 --> 01:16:45.520]  we can be sure that without corrective action, our fiscal trajectory will move the nation
[01:16:45.520 --> 01:16:48.480]  ever closer to that point.
[01:16:48.480 --> 01:16:52.840]  To achieve economic and financial stability, U.S. fiscal policy must be placed on a sustainable
[01:16:52.840 --> 01:16:58.680]  path that ensures that debt relative to national income is at least stable or preferably declining
[01:16:58.680 --> 01:17:00.160]  over time.
[01:17:00.160 --> 01:17:02.760]  Attaining this goal should be a top priority.
[01:17:02.760 --> 01:17:07.760]  Okay, so there you go.
[01:17:07.760 --> 01:17:13.000]  And we will go back to your phone calls here in just a moment.
[01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:15.280]  In fact, let's do it right now.
[01:17:15.280 --> 01:17:17.400]  Mike in New York, you're on the air.
[01:17:17.400 --> 01:17:18.400]  Hey, Alex.
[01:17:18.400 --> 01:17:19.400]  Mick, go ahead.
[01:17:19.400 --> 01:17:21.400]  Glad you got me on, Alex.
[01:17:21.400 --> 01:17:22.400]  It's Mick.
[01:17:22.400 --> 01:17:29.560]  I got a couple of questions here, but I just want to say you're doing a great job.
[01:17:29.560 --> 01:17:31.320]  Two things, really.
[01:17:31.320 --> 01:17:39.040]  Would you urge people to not vote if the choice comes down to Obama and Romney only?
[01:17:39.040 --> 01:17:43.400]  You know, people can do whatever you want, but Obama was bought and paid for.
[01:17:43.400 --> 01:17:46.360]  I knew he'd be bad and people got suckered by it because they wanted change.
[01:17:46.360 --> 01:17:50.040]  It'll be the same thing with Mitt Romney, and it's really just all theater.
[01:17:50.040 --> 01:17:51.240]  It doesn't even matter.
[01:17:51.240 --> 01:17:56.160]  We get 55, 60% turnouts for national elections.
[01:17:56.160 --> 01:17:59.320]  We get 8% or a little higher for local.
[01:17:59.320 --> 01:18:04.320]  Where you can still get in is local, and that's where the globalists have taken over as well.
[01:18:04.320 --> 01:18:08.480]  So I just see the national elections, if it's not Ron Paul, as a distraction.
[01:18:08.480 --> 01:18:15.440]  That's why Ron Paul has already won by injecting real issues and staying in the race and showing
[01:18:15.440 --> 01:18:18.280]  that he was cheated in early states, which they now admit.
[01:18:18.280 --> 01:18:20.520]  I mean, imagine, Ron Paul would have won the early states.
[01:18:20.520 --> 01:18:25.280]  He did win them, but if they would have admitted it, not stolen it, the party machinery, and
[01:18:25.280 --> 01:18:30.720]  if the controlled media hadn't gone along with it, Ron Paul would be the front runner
[01:18:30.720 --> 01:18:36.440]  right now, and he would beat Obama in every Gallup poll out there in the fall, and he
[01:18:36.440 --> 01:18:38.040]  would be our new president.
[01:18:38.040 --> 01:18:42.640]  The American people are actually waking up, but that's not what's going to happen.
[01:18:42.640 --> 01:18:45.240]  So people say, well, then why did you support Ron Paul?
[01:18:45.240 --> 01:18:48.800]  Because by not running, we wouldn't even be able to expose the fraud.
[01:18:48.800 --> 01:18:50.760]  We wouldn't be able to inject issues.
[01:18:50.760 --> 01:18:54.360]  We show it's a rigged game by engaging.
[01:18:54.360 --> 01:18:56.840]  I would love to believe Mitt Romney's a good guy.
[01:18:56.840 --> 01:19:02.320]  He has a very nice personality, just like Obama does on the surface, but he is a vulture,
[01:19:02.320 --> 01:19:05.960]  crony, capital, anti-free market globalist.
[01:19:05.960 --> 01:19:09.440]  He is, I mean, look at his fruits in Massachusetts.
[01:19:09.440 --> 01:19:15.560]  He was pro-abortion, pro-open borders, carbon taxes, anti-gun, and conservatives will go
[01:19:15.560 --> 01:19:18.680]  in there and vote for him, and he becomes president.
[01:19:18.680 --> 01:19:23.960]  They'll sit back while he passes carbon taxes and gun control, because all they want to
[01:19:23.960 --> 01:19:27.880]  do is feel like they're winners, and that they're guys in there.
[01:19:27.880 --> 01:19:30.840]  I mean, it's just like the idiot Obama supporters.
[01:19:30.840 --> 01:19:36.200]  They're just as dumb as a box of rocks.
[01:19:36.200 --> 01:19:37.680]  Does that answer your question, Mick?
[01:19:37.680 --> 01:19:42.600]  Kind of, and I had one other question I was just wondering.
[01:19:42.600 --> 01:19:45.800]  Without a violent solution, I mean, what's going to be the shatter around the world?
[01:19:45.800 --> 01:19:49.480]  I mean, what's finally going to bring this to a breaking point where finally the American
[01:19:49.480 --> 01:19:51.160]  public says enough is enough?
[01:19:51.160 --> 01:19:55.280]  You never know where it'll start, but it'll be like little farmers, they'll try to come
[01:19:55.280 --> 01:19:59.280]  take their kids, they'll try to send in the military, they'll be a shootout, and then a
[01:19:59.280 --> 01:20:01.160]  brush war will start, stuff like that.
[01:20:01.160 --> 01:20:05.080]  Sick of the globalist, you genesis control freaks adding poison to your water, and laughing
[01:20:05.080 --> 01:20:06.760]  as you get sick and die?
[01:20:06.760 --> 01:20:08.960]  Start purifying your water with ProPure.
[01:20:08.960 --> 01:20:13.640]  My friends, I've done a lot of research, and the best gravity filter out there, bar none,
[01:20:13.640 --> 01:20:18.120]  is ProPure, and it's available discounted at infowars.com.
[01:20:18.120 --> 01:20:21.640]  These filters are silver and pregnated to prevent bacterial growth.
[01:20:21.640 --> 01:20:25.800]  There's no priming required, it's NSF42 certified.
[01:20:25.800 --> 01:20:30.840]  Optional fluoride filters can reduce fluoride up to 95%, easy to set up and use, doesn't
[01:20:30.840 --> 01:20:32.360]  require electricity.
[01:20:32.360 --> 01:20:35.260]  Purify water from lake streams, ponds, and wells.
[01:20:35.260 --> 01:20:38.680]  This filter system leaves in beneficial minerals, which is key.
[01:20:38.680 --> 01:20:42.760]  Save money by not buying bottled water, and avoid BPA that leaches from the plastic.
[01:20:42.760 --> 01:20:45.480]  ProPure is the best gravity-fed filter out there.
[01:20:45.480 --> 01:20:50.600]  That's what my family uses, infowars.com already has the lowest price on ProPure, but if you
[01:20:50.600 --> 01:20:56.160]  add the promo code WATER at checkout, you get an additional 10% off at infowars.com.
[01:20:56.160 --> 01:21:03.000]  You can also call to order 888-253-3139.
[01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:06.520]  That's what it sounds like when a burglar kicks in the door of a dark house that looks
[01:21:06.520 --> 01:21:08.080]  like no one is home.
[01:21:08.080 --> 01:21:10.160]  Don't let your home be the next target.
[01:21:10.160 --> 01:21:13.800]  Make it look like someone is home watching television with fake TV.
[01:21:13.800 --> 01:21:18.200]  Fake TV is a small electronic device that makes the same light as a real television.
[01:21:18.200 --> 01:21:21.400]  So from outside, it looks like someone is home watching TV.
[01:21:21.400 --> 01:21:26.000]  Fake TV plugs in just like a lamp on a timer, but is far more convincing to burglars.
[01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:30.960]  Fake TV deters burglars, costs far less than an alarm, and is highly recommended by numerous
[01:21:30.960 --> 01:21:32.280]  police departments.
[01:21:32.280 --> 01:21:34.160]  Use it anytime you're away from home.

[01:21:49.960 --> 01:21:50.960]  both of you.
[01:21:50.960 --> 01:21:59.560]  Call 877-5-FAKE-TV or go to faketv.com, faketv.com, the burglar deterrent.
[01:21:59.560 --> 01:22:04.440]  4, 5, 6, even $7 a gallon.

[01:22:08.840 --> 01:22:10.280]  with no end in sight.

[01:23:55.280 --> 01:23:56.640]  The choice is clear.

[01:24:03.640 --> 01:24:16.760]  There's a gun and ammunition just inside the doorway, using only an emergency.
[01:24:16.760 --> 01:24:17.760]  The American people know that.
[01:24:17.760 --> 01:24:26.480]  They're buying 5 million guns a month, and they hope the globalist hope they can divert
[01:24:26.480 --> 01:24:30.120]  this by puppets like Romney and Obama.
[01:24:30.120 --> 01:24:35.720]  They hope they can make you think the buck really stops with them.
[01:24:35.720 --> 01:24:38.960]  It's like the TSA.
[01:24:38.960 --> 01:24:40.280]  I can't stand them.
[01:24:40.280 --> 01:24:44.920]  They make me angry, but they're the low-grade moron idiots that will sit there and violate
[01:24:44.920 --> 01:24:48.040]  people's rights and be radiated themselves all day.
[01:24:48.040 --> 01:24:51.960]  What about the Congress allowing this to happen?
[01:24:51.960 --> 01:24:53.480]  What about the president?
[01:24:53.480 --> 01:24:55.360]  What about the special interest?
[01:24:55.360 --> 01:24:58.480]  What about the companies like RapistScan?
[01:24:58.480 --> 01:25:01.480]  It's actually called Rappascan, RapistScan.
[01:25:01.480 --> 01:25:04.120]  What about them?
[01:25:04.120 --> 01:25:06.440]  What about boycotting their subsidiaries?
[01:25:06.440 --> 01:25:08.720]  What about getting aggressive?
[01:25:08.720 --> 01:25:11.840]  What about spreading the word about this radio show that's reaching more people than any
[01:25:11.840 --> 01:25:14.040]  other single venue?
[01:25:14.040 --> 01:25:18.280]  What about spreading the word about infowars.com, the systems fighting tooth and nails and censor?
[01:25:18.280 --> 01:25:21.480]  Why do you think they want to start censoring talk radio on the Internet?
[01:25:21.480 --> 01:25:22.480]  Use it or lose it?
[01:25:22.480 --> 01:25:24.960]  It's not just we need to use it before they take it away.
[01:25:24.960 --> 01:25:28.680]  We use it to keep it.
[01:25:28.680 --> 01:25:33.800]  Now you asked where the shot heard around the world is going to happen.
[01:25:33.800 --> 01:25:37.600]  The shot heard around the world has already happened in the Info War, but will there be
[01:25:37.600 --> 01:25:38.600]  a physical trigger?
[01:25:38.600 --> 01:25:45.160]  I hope not, because the globalists are going to sit off shore while the military and the
[01:25:45.160 --> 01:25:49.480]  police get absolutely chewed into a million pieces, and that's part of the plan.
[01:25:49.480 --> 01:25:51.120]  It's all public in the Rand Corporation.
[01:25:51.120 --> 01:25:53.280]  I've written articles, done films, cited it.
[01:25:53.280 --> 01:25:54.840]  You can look it up.
[01:25:54.840 --> 01:25:59.320]  There's always been plans, and I've had Colonel Craig Robertson and countless others, and
[01:25:59.320 --> 01:26:03.440]  it's been on C-SPAN, where they admit the plan is to have a civil war.
[01:26:03.440 --> 01:26:07.720]  It's one of the plans, since the caller asked about this, it's a big deal.
[01:26:07.720 --> 01:26:12.320]  Chew up the infrastructure, collapse for a year or two, then bring in I-4.
[01:26:12.320 --> 01:26:13.320]  Bring in NATO.
[01:26:13.320 --> 01:26:15.440]  Bring in foreign troop contingents.
[01:26:15.440 --> 01:26:16.520]  It's in the video games.
[01:26:16.520 --> 01:26:17.920]  It's in the comic books.
[01:26:17.920 --> 01:26:21.080]  They're acclimating everybody for this.
[01:26:21.080 --> 01:26:25.320]  In fact, guys, queue up the trailer for Shattered Union.
[01:26:25.320 --> 01:26:26.720]  It's on YouTube.
[01:26:26.720 --> 01:26:28.320]  We've got it saved, too.
[01:26:28.320 --> 01:26:32.680]  But it's a video game where a civil war starts, things break up, and again, the globalists
[01:26:32.680 --> 01:26:38.440]  create mega-regions, but then break up the subregions within that were the actual original
[01:26:38.440 --> 01:26:39.440]  country.
[01:26:39.440 --> 01:26:40.840]  You understand?
[01:26:40.840 --> 01:26:45.600]  They create global unions and regional unions, but destroy it within.
[01:26:45.600 --> 01:26:51.080]  It'll start with another wake up, or it'll start with the trying to shut down the rural
[01:26:51.080 --> 01:26:54.960]  farms and stuff, and cops get killed all the time, but the bureaucrats are going to
[01:26:54.960 --> 01:26:58.480]  get killed more, trying to take property and stuff, and they try to keep it quiet when
[01:26:58.480 --> 01:26:59.480]  it happens.
[01:26:59.480 --> 01:27:00.480]  But there'll be flash points.
[01:27:00.480 --> 01:27:02.160]  There'll be brush fire rebellions.
[01:27:02.160 --> 01:27:05.440]  It's happened before, since the country was founded when the Rockefellers were out west
[01:27:05.440 --> 01:27:10.560]  stealing property with different security firms like Pinkerton Boys and others.
[01:27:10.560 --> 01:27:15.160]  You see the old Westerns that are like fiction following fact, where the railroad comes into
[01:27:15.160 --> 01:27:18.440]  town and says, we're taking your waterholes and your gold mine, and the local's like,
[01:27:18.440 --> 01:27:21.720]  no, you're not, and they shoot the guy on the street, and the town stands up to him.
[01:27:21.720 --> 01:27:23.240]  There are hundreds of real stories.
[01:27:23.240 --> 01:27:24.720]  That's why I love history.
[01:27:24.720 --> 01:27:30.160]  There are whole books where it's just, the whole middle of the country, Texas, right
[01:27:30.160 --> 01:27:35.240]  through the west, and the feds couldn't hold it, and the foreign bankers couldn't hold
[01:27:35.240 --> 01:27:36.240]  it.
[01:27:36.240 --> 01:27:37.240]  They ended up losing.
[01:27:37.240 --> 01:27:40.080]  People were just starting killing.
[01:27:40.080 --> 01:27:44.280]  You know, they'd come into a town in Colorado and murder a whole village of people that
[01:27:44.280 --> 01:27:48.160]  had, that were squatting on their own gold mine.
[01:27:48.160 --> 01:27:54.560]  But then the Pinkerton security people, well, they started falling down and hitting their
[01:27:54.560 --> 01:27:55.560]  heads.
[01:27:55.560 --> 01:28:05.120]  That was back when Americans knew they better stand up for children murdered by the Rockefellers.
[01:28:05.120 --> 01:28:11.720]  Does that answer your question, Mick?
[01:28:11.720 --> 01:28:14.520]  I love how they always say, I want to hold over and get your question right, and I'm
[01:28:14.520 --> 01:28:15.520]  about to go back to them.
[01:28:15.520 --> 01:28:16.520]  They hang up.
[01:28:16.520 --> 01:28:17.920]  Let's give somebody a minute and a half here.
[01:28:17.920 --> 01:28:20.440]  Brian in Colorado, speaking of Colorado, go ahead.
[01:28:20.440 --> 01:28:21.440]  You're on the air.
[01:28:21.440 --> 01:28:22.440]  Hi, Alex.
[01:28:22.440 --> 01:28:24.440]  Nice to talk to you.
[01:28:24.440 --> 01:28:25.440]  Yes, sir.
[01:28:25.440 --> 01:28:27.760]  A couple of quick points.
[01:28:27.760 --> 01:28:36.240]  I live on a major thoroughfare in Colorado from Denver to basically Utah, and they're
[01:28:36.240 --> 01:28:43.120]  building a monstrous, I guess it's a fusion center in Utah.
[01:28:43.120 --> 01:28:45.640]  Yeah, they're building them all over the country.
[01:28:45.640 --> 01:28:49.440]  Yeah, but that giant one in Utah is mega massive.
[01:28:49.440 --> 01:28:58.480]  I've been seeing them bring these huge, wide-load water tanks, green military colors through
[01:28:58.480 --> 01:29:00.680]  the thoroughfare that I'm at.
[01:29:00.680 --> 01:29:01.680]  Yeah, no, no, no.
[01:29:01.680 --> 01:29:06.440]  There are abilities, admittedly, to be self-sufficient against its enemy, the American people.
[01:29:06.440 --> 01:29:11.200]  Well, what I saw the other day were two giant ovens.
[01:29:11.200 --> 01:29:16.840]  They were two gigantic, green, the same green color ovens with a little window that was
[01:29:16.840 --> 01:29:20.720]  about six inches thick and a door on the back with no handle.
[01:29:20.720 --> 01:29:25.960]  That was actually in the Rocky Mountain News, now defunct, great paper, that under Homeland
[01:29:25.960 --> 01:29:30.040]  Security they purchased ovens that could cremate tens of thousands a week.
[01:29:30.040 --> 01:29:31.040]  I'm not kidding.
[01:29:31.040 --> 01:29:32.040]  I'm not up.
[01:29:32.040 --> 01:29:33.040]  I'm not joking.
[01:29:33.040 --> 01:29:38.320]  They said for during a plague, yeah, there's a lot of news about crematoriums at military
[01:29:38.320 --> 01:29:39.320]  bases in Colorado.
[01:29:39.320 --> 01:29:45.200]  I mean, you're right there, smack dab in the middle of New World Order, Command Base West,
[01:29:45.200 --> 01:29:47.200]  London's Command Base East.
[01:29:47.200 --> 01:29:50.360]  I want to hear more about this.
[01:29:50.360 --> 01:29:54.120]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.120 --> 01:30:01.120]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:24.120 --> 01:30:31.120]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run, we're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[01:30:54.120 --> 01:31:04.800]  Right now, the average family spends one fourth of their income on food.
[01:31:04.800 --> 01:31:08.960]  It's time to cut your food budget in half by using the best, most affordable food on

[01:33:31.200 --> 01:33:37.560]  The most ravenous, wicked globalists you can imagine are openly in control of our country
[01:33:37.560 --> 01:33:43.640]  and are busily trying to bankrupt every man, woman and child to bring in a hellish system
[01:33:43.640 --> 01:33:45.520]  of total control.
[01:33:45.520 --> 01:33:51.960]  No parental rights, forced inoculations, open borders, you can't teach your children
[01:33:51.960 --> 01:33:53.480]  the faith you wish.
[01:33:53.480 --> 01:33:57.820]  They must go to government training camps or private schools that are government accredited.
[01:33:57.820 --> 01:34:01.680]  It is hellish and it's all going to move faster and faster.
[01:34:01.680 --> 01:34:05.160]  They're now out in the open saying kill babies up to age three.
[01:34:05.160 --> 01:34:09.560]  We've got Bill Gates saying kill grandmothers, hire teachers, laughing about it, the teachers
[01:34:09.560 --> 01:34:10.560]  clap.
[01:34:10.560 --> 01:34:13.960]  We're going to go to the infowars reporter contest video, just a couple that came in
[01:34:13.960 --> 01:34:14.960]  yesterday.
[01:34:14.960 --> 01:34:18.840]  And if you're not watching on PrismPlanet.tv, you really want to for the third report with
[01:34:18.840 --> 01:34:22.120]  the young lady with the machine guns.
[01:34:22.120 --> 01:34:24.920]  Something like a young lady firing machine guns.
[01:34:24.920 --> 01:34:28.520]  So, so that is coming up.
[01:34:28.520 --> 01:34:30.960]  Rob do's in here with us.
[01:34:30.960 --> 01:34:36.440]  But right now, let's go back to a very serious subject, Brian, you know, normally if somebody
[01:34:36.440 --> 01:34:41.840]  called in and said, I'm up here by the NSA base being built, you know, right by Colorado
[01:34:41.840 --> 01:34:46.400]  and Utah that Congress has said they want to know about, they were told, hey, we don't
[01:34:46.400 --> 01:34:48.960]  work for America, shut up.
[01:34:48.960 --> 01:34:51.240]  We illegally spy on everybody.
[01:34:51.240 --> 01:34:52.240]  You know, we do what we want.
[01:34:52.240 --> 01:34:54.320]  Now drink some fluoride, take some shots.
[01:34:54.320 --> 01:34:56.800]  Aren't you supposed to have cancer by now?
[01:34:56.800 --> 01:35:02.200]  So, so the giant illegal command base, but it's funny, the Rocky Mountain News, I guess
[01:35:02.200 --> 01:35:07.120]  when our business peers go like so many newspapers, good paper actually, even at the editor on
[01:35:07.120 --> 01:35:11.680]  your big mainline paper, they reported on the governor's press conference about the crematoriums
[01:35:11.680 --> 01:35:17.280]  they bought to cremate tens of thousands a week during a plague and that those were at
[01:35:17.280 --> 01:35:18.280]  military bases.
[01:35:18.280 --> 01:35:20.520]  So that is in the news.
[01:35:20.520 --> 01:35:21.520]  That sounds crazy.
[01:35:21.520 --> 01:35:22.520]  It's real.
[01:35:22.520 --> 01:35:23.520]  The problem is people always blur the lines.
[01:35:23.520 --> 01:35:26.520]  I was reading, I'm going to go back to the call in a minute, we'll put him back on hold
[01:35:26.520 --> 01:35:27.520]  for a second.
[01:35:27.520 --> 01:35:28.520]  I want to make this point.
[01:35:28.520 --> 01:35:31.040]  Ukrainian Marines stop drivers.
[01:35:31.040 --> 01:35:37.280]  That's BBC as part of a drill, NLE09, FEMA working with 15 nations to fight domestic
[01:35:37.280 --> 01:35:38.280]  terrorists.
[01:35:38.280 --> 01:35:39.600]  That's from their own fact sheet.
[01:35:39.600 --> 01:35:41.280]  Go look it up for yourself.
[01:35:41.280 --> 01:35:45.440]  Those are real things, our article out of the Chinese and Russian and U.S. News, Russian
[01:35:45.440 --> 01:35:50.520]  troops to target American terrorists, Russian troops to target terrorists in America as
[01:35:50.520 --> 01:35:57.000]  part of drill, joint U.S. Russian air, exercise, stokes, fears of martial law.
[01:35:57.000 --> 01:36:00.640]  And then I went to the next article thinking it was the stack I had earlier, but they'd
[01:36:00.640 --> 01:36:02.040]  come and added something to it.
[01:36:02.040 --> 01:36:03.040]  Nobody's bad.
[01:36:03.040 --> 01:36:04.040]  This happens.
[01:36:04.040 --> 01:36:08.560]  And it was EU times, pure disinfo on purpose.
[01:36:08.560 --> 01:36:12.000]  And this has got to be government because I've noticed they always take real stuff and then
[01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:13.560]  add a lie on purpose.
[01:36:13.560 --> 01:36:14.560]  And never the truth.
[01:36:14.560 --> 01:36:16.880]  It always comes out from the Kremlin.
[01:36:16.880 --> 01:36:19.400]  Yeah, I don't think your mic's hooked up properly.
[01:36:19.400 --> 01:36:22.920]  So we may even have to do this next hour, but whatever.
[01:36:22.920 --> 01:36:27.080]  Point is, is that, yeah, it always has to do with the Kremlin or where we got to find
[01:36:27.080 --> 01:36:31.240]  out who runs this, because then this gets injected and then when we cover real stuff,
[01:36:31.240 --> 01:36:33.240]  they'll say, oh, that was that EU times.
[01:36:33.240 --> 01:36:35.400]  And even it just happened to me.
[01:36:35.400 --> 01:36:39.200]  And we'll also get articles submitted that look real and I go check them quickly and
[01:36:39.200 --> 01:36:40.400]  it looks accurate.
[01:36:40.400 --> 01:36:41.400]  And then it's not.
[01:36:41.400 --> 01:36:44.920]  I mean, it's just, it's so much crazy stuff is happening.
[01:36:44.920 --> 01:36:48.200]  And then when I see a site that, you know, accidentally gets stuff wrong sometimes, that's
[01:36:48.200 --> 01:36:49.200]  one thing.
[01:36:49.200 --> 01:36:50.200]  This news is moving so fast.
[01:36:50.200 --> 01:36:55.480]  But when it's always wrong on purpose, attached to real stuff, that's called a honeypot.
[01:36:55.480 --> 01:36:56.480]  What were you trying to say, dude?
[01:36:56.480 --> 01:37:00.200]  Yeah, that comes out of, they always say, special report coming out of the Kremlin.
[01:37:00.200 --> 01:37:01.600]  That's how it always starts.
[01:37:01.600 --> 01:37:06.680]  And or this special report prepared that our sources got and it's always inside Russia.
[01:37:06.680 --> 01:37:10.400]  And it's that, that writer that we all know and love is, you know, we're going to say
[01:37:10.400 --> 01:37:11.400]  your name.
[01:37:11.400 --> 01:37:12.400]  It doesn't even matter.
[01:37:12.400 --> 01:37:15.720]  I mean, I mean, the point is, is that Watson was calling a minute ago going, Alex just
[01:37:15.720 --> 01:37:16.720]  mentioned that.
[01:37:16.720 --> 01:37:17.920]  And I'm like, oh, yeah, it's in the stack.
[01:37:17.920 --> 01:37:19.920]  It's like Glenn Beck bought it and went with it.
[01:37:19.920 --> 01:37:20.920]  Yeah.
[01:37:20.920 --> 01:37:21.920]  You know, and that the Russians are going to go to the airport.
[01:37:21.920 --> 01:37:25.920]  No, they're going to be at the nearby military base training to fight you and your family.
[01:37:25.920 --> 01:37:29.640]  We have an article with all the government links, all the admissions video.
[01:37:29.640 --> 01:37:31.320]  We've shot all of it.
[01:37:31.320 --> 01:37:32.600]  You need to get in there and get that.
[01:37:32.600 --> 01:37:34.200]  We made a film when we went to Chicago.
[01:37:34.200 --> 01:37:36.520]  I mean, it's Polish and American troops.
[01:37:36.520 --> 01:37:37.720]  There's Latvian troops there.
[01:37:37.720 --> 01:37:42.080]  They had the Polish secret of FBI equivalent called the, and they're called the B.O.
[01:37:42.080 --> 01:37:45.560]  And they had U.S. school kids taking part in it and being rounded up and having their
[01:37:45.560 --> 01:37:46.560]  guns taken.
[01:37:46.560 --> 01:37:47.560]  Yeah.
[01:37:47.560 --> 01:37:48.560]  Well, that, that was the worst part.
[01:37:48.560 --> 01:37:52.720]  I thought it was the Polish troops holding guns over Boy Scouts and, you know, treating
[01:37:52.720 --> 01:37:55.200]  them, you know, yelling at them, telling them to line up there.
[01:37:55.200 --> 01:37:56.560]  It was a fake terrorist attack.
[01:37:56.560 --> 01:37:59.680]  But again, I've been to these drills myself many times.
[01:37:59.680 --> 01:38:01.200]  They're training to take on Americans.
[01:38:01.200 --> 01:38:02.360]  I have it on video.
[01:38:02.360 --> 01:38:03.360]  Right.
[01:38:03.360 --> 01:38:08.960]  They admitted, NLE09, FEMA.gov admitted, you know, nine, this was foreign troops for
[01:38:08.960 --> 01:38:11.640]  Americans, four terror attacks in the U.S.
[01:38:11.640 --> 01:38:15.120]  And then again, at the Olympics, they had Mexican and U.S. troops in Canada.
[01:38:15.120 --> 01:38:16.120]  Yeah.
[01:38:16.120 --> 01:38:17.880]  And our troops are working with other countries.
[01:38:17.880 --> 01:38:21.080]  So when something happens, say in Poland, it's going to be U.S. troops.
[01:38:21.080 --> 01:38:23.120]  It's not going to be Polish troops rounding people up.
[01:38:23.120 --> 01:38:24.840]  It's going to be somebody else, some other country.
[01:38:24.840 --> 01:38:29.120]  Because it's global banker government, just like the Russians used to send troops from
[01:38:29.120 --> 01:38:33.320]  one end of the country, 5,000 miles away to the other end, because you don't want people
[01:38:33.320 --> 01:38:37.280]  from the local area trying to suppress the population, because the troops will turn against
[01:38:37.280 --> 01:38:38.280]  you.
[01:38:38.280 --> 01:38:42.840]  Like in Tiananmen Square, they didn't respond for almost an entire day, like 12, 14 hours,
[01:38:42.840 --> 01:38:48.640]  because they had to bust the troops 600 miles down from another subgroup that speaks another
[01:38:48.640 --> 01:38:49.640]  dialect.
[01:38:49.640 --> 01:38:50.640]  Right.
[01:38:50.640 --> 01:38:51.640]  And that's the way you do it.
[01:38:51.640 --> 01:38:52.640]  You don't do it with your buddy down the street.
[01:38:52.640 --> 01:38:53.640]  He's not going to take your guns.
[01:38:53.640 --> 01:38:58.040]  But, you know, the Polish troops probably will take your guns.
[01:38:58.040 --> 01:39:00.040]  They won't do it here if they're smart, though.
[01:39:00.040 --> 01:39:01.040]  They're going to be some problems.
[01:39:01.040 --> 01:39:05.120]  Well, they use German troops against us, because the English-speaking troops were having trouble
[01:39:05.120 --> 01:39:07.560]  with other English in the colonies, the Hessians.
[01:39:07.560 --> 01:39:09.360]  All right, let's go back to the callers, sir.
[01:39:09.360 --> 01:39:12.360]  I don't know if I can believe you or not, but you should obviously get some photos.
[01:39:12.360 --> 01:39:13.920]  I'm not saying you're a liar.
[01:39:13.920 --> 01:39:19.040]  All I know is somebody needs to dig up the Rocky Mountain News where they, it was like
[01:39:19.040 --> 01:39:22.520]  governor and crematoriums for plague.
[01:39:22.520 --> 01:39:23.520]  But go ahead.
[01:39:23.520 --> 01:39:24.520]  Tell us what you saw.
[01:39:24.520 --> 01:39:31.160]  The most disturbing thing was that they had a glass window in it to watch the burning.
[01:39:31.160 --> 01:39:35.000]  It certainly was some kind of a cremation chamber.
[01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:38.400]  It had huge ventilations to pump smoke out.
[01:39:38.400 --> 01:39:46.040]  On the other side, there were giant gauges for propane or some other gas to pump in.
[01:39:46.040 --> 01:39:48.080]  There was no door handle on it.
[01:39:48.080 --> 01:39:49.160]  It was all metal.
[01:39:49.160 --> 01:39:50.840]  There was metal and glass.
[01:39:50.840 --> 01:39:51.840]  That's all it was.
[01:39:51.840 --> 01:39:52.840]  It was built as an oven.
[01:39:52.840 --> 01:39:54.600]  It was a giant oven.
[01:39:54.600 --> 01:39:55.600]  I'm certain of it.
[01:39:55.600 --> 01:39:56.600]  And it was the same color.
[01:39:56.600 --> 01:40:00.600]  There's all the other material that I've seen them trucking through on wide loads heading
[01:40:00.600 --> 01:40:01.760]  toward Utah.
[01:40:01.760 --> 01:40:04.880]  And this has been going on for a couple of years, but this is the first time I've seen
[01:40:04.880 --> 01:40:05.880]  those.
[01:40:05.880 --> 01:40:09.880]  All I know is they say they will secretly arrest Americans, torture you and kill you.
[01:40:09.880 --> 01:40:14.160]  And they've been creating brigades of demons that enjoy doing it just like they hired defunct
[01:40:14.160 --> 01:40:19.240]  and fired federal and state prison guards, run Abu Ghraib, rapes in the Army's own report.
[01:40:19.240 --> 01:40:24.440]  General Tagumbus on report, admitted, raping children in front of their parents.
[01:40:24.440 --> 01:40:26.240]  That's who runs our country.
[01:40:26.240 --> 01:40:27.240]  Get photos.
[01:40:27.240 --> 01:40:28.240]  Get it out to everybody.
[01:40:28.240 --> 01:40:30.760]  In fact, we need reporters to go up.
[01:40:30.760 --> 01:40:31.760]  Local news has been covering it.
[01:40:31.760 --> 01:40:33.720]  Wire magazine's been covering it.
[01:40:33.720 --> 01:40:35.600]  We've been to the NSA base in San Antonio.
[01:40:35.600 --> 01:40:38.600]  They try to come over in the Walmart parking lot and tell us we can't.
[01:40:38.600 --> 01:40:43.640]  Wait, you illegally surveil us, but you're feds off of your little reservation telling
[01:40:43.640 --> 01:40:44.640]  us we can't.
[01:40:44.640 --> 01:40:45.640]  We ought to go down there.
[01:40:45.640 --> 01:40:46.640]  I'm sick of it.
[01:40:46.640 --> 01:40:48.400]  I'm sick of your crime.
[01:40:48.400 --> 01:40:49.400]  You're not Americans.
[01:40:49.400 --> 01:40:53.680]  You work for Goldman Sachs to destroy this country and you run Al-Qaeda on record as
[01:40:53.680 --> 01:40:56.920]  Sybil Evans, your own person inside the NSA exposed.
[01:40:56.920 --> 01:40:58.080]  Thank you, sir.
[01:40:58.080 --> 01:40:59.080]  I'm done.
[01:40:59.080 --> 01:41:01.960]  And people are inside the NSA going, well, I'm not a traitor.
[01:41:01.960 --> 01:41:03.120]  You're compartmentalized.
[01:41:03.120 --> 01:41:05.840]  You're doing illegal stuff, passing it on.
[01:41:05.840 --> 01:41:08.280]  You're so sloppy at Bilderberg four years ago.
[01:41:08.280 --> 01:41:12.800]  They had NSA and all the side offices and I could walk right in and listen to you.
[01:41:12.800 --> 01:41:14.720]  You're so stupid.
[01:41:14.720 --> 01:41:16.360]  And there you are spying on everybody.
[01:41:16.360 --> 01:41:17.640]  I can hear you in there.
[01:41:17.640 --> 01:41:21.760]  You're doing about your Navy and Air Force and Army satellites and dial in and listen
[01:41:21.760 --> 01:41:22.760]  to this person.
[01:41:22.760 --> 01:41:23.760]  Listen to that person.
[01:41:23.760 --> 01:41:27.200]  All right, Rob, do I want to shift gears now and we'll go into the next segment.
[01:41:27.200 --> 01:41:28.520]  This is very exciting.
[01:41:28.520 --> 01:41:29.520]  What's happened?
[01:41:29.520 --> 01:41:32.160]  Give us a little briefing on the reporter's contest.
[01:41:32.160 --> 01:41:35.040]  People've got five more days to get their submissions in.
[01:41:35.040 --> 01:41:37.120]  This is just amazing the type of entries we're getting.
[01:41:37.120 --> 01:41:41.000]  Now we're going to start almost every day in the next month playing some of the better
[01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:42.760]  submissions here on air.
[01:41:42.760 --> 01:41:43.760]  Right.
[01:41:43.760 --> 01:41:48.240]  The deadline, just so everybody knows, April 30th, 2 p.m. central, when the show ends,
[01:41:48.240 --> 01:41:50.600]  that Monday, that will be the deadline.
[01:41:50.600 --> 01:41:53.600]  If you send it in at 2 0 1 central, we're not going to accept it.
[01:41:53.600 --> 01:41:56.840]  So get it in before the show ends on Monday.
[01:41:56.840 --> 01:41:58.320]  And we've had some great reports.
[01:41:58.320 --> 01:42:03.800]  I've really been excited looking at all these, lots of, you know, some people have better
[01:42:03.800 --> 01:42:04.880]  technical skills.
[01:42:04.880 --> 01:42:06.720]  Some people have better interpersonal skills.
[01:42:06.720 --> 01:42:10.120]  Some people have both, you know, and it's been really awesome.
[01:42:10.120 --> 01:42:14.600]  One guy who entered the contest early on, he was one of the first guys, he was, he went
[01:42:14.600 --> 01:42:21.280]  to a United Nations Korean War Memorial and basically had guns encased in cement.
[01:42:21.280 --> 01:42:25.880]  And he was there and he has this great kind of northeastern accent, his name's Dan Baddandi.
[01:42:25.880 --> 01:42:28.960]  And he's going off on it and going off on, he starts reading from the Second Amendment.
[01:42:28.960 --> 01:42:30.800]  He's, you know, they better not try that stuff here.
[01:42:30.800 --> 01:42:35.920]  I mean, that's the kind of moxie, you know, we're looking for, you know, for info warriors.
[01:42:35.920 --> 01:42:39.880]  And he submitted something on the 24th, he posted on the 24th.
[01:42:39.880 --> 01:42:42.320]  We posted it last night and I was blown away.
[01:42:42.320 --> 01:42:44.080]  He's going to a Ron Paul rally.
[01:42:44.080 --> 01:42:47.280]  He's standing there beside the stage and all of a sudden he's backstage or Ron Paul and
[01:42:47.280 --> 01:42:50.680]  he gets, you know, a one interview question, which is, you know, better than what most
[01:42:50.680 --> 01:42:52.360]  people get, especially with Ron Paul.
[01:42:52.360 --> 01:42:53.960]  And, you know, he was there.
[01:42:53.960 --> 01:42:55.760]  He was at the right spot at the right time.
[01:42:55.760 --> 01:42:58.240]  Agenda 21 and my only, and we're going to play that right now.
[01:42:58.240 --> 01:43:03.640]  My only frustration is we don't have the money to hire four people, much less, you know,
[01:43:03.640 --> 01:43:05.640]  the dozens of incredible people.
[01:43:05.640 --> 01:43:12.040]  I've never had a contest this hard because it's so good and everybody that submits something,
[01:43:12.040 --> 01:43:13.040]  you're being seen.
[01:43:13.040 --> 01:43:14.120]  It's getting the word out.
[01:43:14.120 --> 01:43:15.120]  You're becoming the reporter.
[01:43:15.120 --> 01:43:16.120]  You already are.
[01:43:16.120 --> 01:43:21.160]  So even if you don't win, keep doing it as an info wars auxiliary reporter or start your
[01:43:21.160 --> 01:43:22.160]  own group.
[01:43:22.160 --> 01:43:23.160]  Right.
[01:43:23.160 --> 01:43:24.160]  This is so exciting.
[01:43:24.160 --> 01:43:25.160]  Great job folks.
[01:43:25.160 --> 01:43:28.680]  And I've noticed a lot of the comments, Hey, you know, I found you because of this contest.
[01:43:28.680 --> 01:43:29.680]  This is great.
[01:43:29.680 --> 01:43:32.920]  So we're, we're making connections just by people making these videos and there's banners
[01:43:32.920 --> 01:43:36.400]  on the right hand side of when a link through and see the submissions and read the rules
[01:43:36.400 --> 01:43:37.400]  and stuff.
[01:43:37.400 --> 01:43:42.440]  And also people can go to info wars.com forward slash reporter dash contest.
[01:43:42.440 --> 01:43:46.840]  In fact, I'll Twitter that out too for people just in case they don't wait, do something
[01:43:46.840 --> 01:43:47.840]  the next few days.
[01:43:47.840 --> 01:43:48.840]  You could be the winner.
[01:43:48.840 --> 01:43:49.840]  And you have time.
[01:43:49.840 --> 01:43:53.160]  There's plenty of time to, I mean, you can shoot the report in 20 minutes and you can
[01:43:53.160 --> 01:43:54.160]  run again.
[01:43:54.160 --> 01:43:56.920]  There's two winners, one male, one female, 5,000 a piece.
[01:43:56.920 --> 01:44:01.440]  But the point is that you, they might, the people that win the money may not end up being
[01:44:01.440 --> 01:44:02.600]  the reporters.
[01:44:02.600 --> 01:44:03.880]  Just put you in the running for that.
[01:44:03.880 --> 01:44:07.080]  They may not want to move here, but we'll have a whole pool of other people we can look
[01:44:07.080 --> 01:44:08.080]  at and go, well,
[01:44:08.080 --> 01:44:10.080]  And by the way, we didn't even mean to do that.
[01:44:10.080 --> 01:44:11.080]  Listeners pointed that out.
[01:44:11.080 --> 01:44:12.080]  Right.
[01:44:12.080 --> 01:44:14.720]  A couple of them said, I don't know if I want to move, but here's my submission.
[01:44:14.720 --> 01:44:15.720]  You know, do I have to move?
[01:44:15.720 --> 01:44:17.160]  A lot of people are asking, do I have to move?
[01:44:17.160 --> 01:44:18.160]  If I win?
[01:44:18.160 --> 01:44:21.640]  No, we can, we can do something as we don't have, I mean, we can get paid something or
[01:44:21.640 --> 01:44:24.840]  have your own side or get a local sponsor, then we'll play it.
[01:44:24.840 --> 01:44:25.840]  They'll get business.
[01:44:25.840 --> 01:44:26.840]  I mean, I don't know.
[01:44:26.840 --> 01:44:27.840]  We'll work something out.
[01:44:27.840 --> 01:44:28.840]  Thomas, we're so busy.
[01:44:28.840 --> 01:44:29.840]  We don't have time to haggle with everybody.
[01:44:29.840 --> 01:44:34.280]  You want to attack the new world order, you want to be in the fight, be an info wars auxiliary
[01:44:34.280 --> 01:44:35.280]  reporter.
[01:44:35.280 --> 01:44:40.680]  And again, we'll center that article for people so they can see it and get it out to folks.
[01:44:40.680 --> 01:44:41.680]  Okay.
[01:44:41.680 --> 01:44:50.720]  Let's go ahead and play this first video, Ron Paul, Ron Paul exposes agenda 21.
[01:44:50.720 --> 01:44:53.360]  Just a little note to our reporters, give it a headline like that, because that's what
[01:44:53.360 --> 01:44:55.480]  he does.
[01:44:55.480 --> 01:45:00.080]  For Ron Paul, agenda 21 is part of a larger globalist takeover, instead of getting to
[01:45:00.080 --> 01:45:04.440]  470 views, now that we've linked to it, we'll get 10,000, then it would get 100,000.
[01:45:04.440 --> 01:45:05.440]  Right.
[01:45:05.440 --> 01:45:07.400]  Because you got to actually call it what it is.
[01:45:07.400 --> 01:45:12.200]  It's fine to have infowars.com reporter contest, Dan Badandi interview with Ron Paul and Romney.
[01:45:12.200 --> 01:45:13.200]  That's great.
[01:45:13.200 --> 01:45:14.200]  That's a good headline.
[01:45:14.200 --> 01:45:18.360]  But no, Ron Paul attacks agenda 21, something like that.
[01:45:18.360 --> 01:45:19.360]  Here it is.
[01:45:19.360 --> 01:45:25.680]  All right, Dan Badandi, infowars.com, and yes, stand here with Ron Paul, Ron Paul, question
[01:45:25.680 --> 01:45:28.360]  today is, what were you going to do if you got to get in his presence in the United States?
[01:45:28.360 --> 01:45:31.600]  What would you do against agenda 21 of the United Nations?
[01:45:31.600 --> 01:45:33.320]  I'd like to get out of the United Nations.
[01:45:33.320 --> 01:45:38.600]  What I'd like to do is I would want to have any attack on our national sovereignty, and
[01:45:38.600 --> 01:45:40.600]  that's what agenda 21 does.
[01:45:40.600 --> 01:45:46.920]  And I think as a threat right now, they talk about currency reform because they know what
[01:45:46.920 --> 01:45:50.640]  we know that the currency is in trouble, they'd like to do it under the United Nations, and
[01:45:50.640 --> 01:45:55.200]  I complain tonight in my speech that our president thinks you're going to war under the United
[01:45:55.200 --> 01:45:56.200]  Nations.
[01:45:56.200 --> 01:45:58.200]  So when it's at 21, that's just a further step.
[01:45:58.200 --> 01:46:03.200]  And all I do, I believe in local sovereignty, individual sovereignty, state sovereignty,
[01:46:03.200 --> 01:46:07.800]  and minimal federal government, I just don't think that we should put up with more losses
[01:46:07.800 --> 01:46:17.960]  on it to an international government.
[01:46:17.960 --> 01:46:22.120]  The answer to 1934 is 1776, a giant banner.
[01:46:22.120 --> 01:46:25.880]  You know what I like in the beginning of this, he's shooting himself as he's sitting in line
[01:46:25.880 --> 01:46:30.680]  in traffic going to see Ron Paul, and he said, there's two miles ahead of me of traffic,
[01:46:30.680 --> 01:46:34.080]  there's a mile behind me, and we're all going to see Ron Paul, and he goes, I bet there's
[01:46:34.080 --> 01:46:38.880]  nobody at the Romney, you know, speech, and they're both in Rhode Island that day.
[01:46:38.880 --> 01:46:41.400]  And I thought that was, I mean, it's just, it's great.
[01:46:41.400 --> 01:46:44.000]  And it wasn't masterfully produced, you know.
[01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:47.120]  He's taking action and he got Ron Paul.
[01:46:47.120 --> 01:46:48.120]  Exactly.
[01:46:48.120 --> 01:46:51.040]  That's the essence of victory, resistance is victory.
[01:46:51.040 --> 01:46:55.120]  You may get your butt kicked politically a hundred times, you're going to get tougher.
[01:46:55.120 --> 01:46:56.120]  Right.
[01:46:56.120 --> 01:46:59.240]  And there's another one, I think Aaron's going to post this article, or this video with
[01:46:59.240 --> 01:47:03.640]  another video that it's some info warriors who went to the Washington, I don't know
[01:47:03.640 --> 01:47:07.560]  if it was a primary or a caucus, and they were exposing the.
[01:47:07.560 --> 01:47:10.720]  They caught total fraud right there pulling the vote machines out and saying, no, they
[01:47:10.720 --> 01:47:11.720]  weren't vote machines.
[01:47:11.720 --> 01:47:12.720]  These weren't bad.
[01:47:12.720 --> 01:47:14.560]  And then they catch him and it's just, oh, I don't not doing it, and then shows her
[01:47:14.560 --> 01:47:15.560]  with them.
[01:47:15.560 --> 01:47:16.560]  Yeah.
[01:47:16.560 --> 01:47:17.560]  Because that's their military op.
[01:47:17.560 --> 01:47:18.560]  I'm not doing that.
[01:47:18.560 --> 01:47:20.560]  I mean, you can have a knife stabbing a baby and you're like, that's a baby.
[01:47:20.560 --> 01:47:21.560]  No, it's not.
[01:47:21.560 --> 01:47:22.560]  Look over there.
[01:47:22.560 --> 01:47:23.560]  And then they go.
[01:47:23.560 --> 01:47:24.560]  Yeah.
[01:47:24.560 --> 01:47:25.560]  I mean, you know, it's all military tactics, folks.
[01:47:25.560 --> 01:47:26.560]  Understand that.
[01:47:26.560 --> 01:47:29.800]  So that's, I mean, the reports are amazing that are coming in.
[01:47:29.800 --> 01:47:30.800]  Great stuff.
[01:47:30.800 --> 01:47:31.800]  You want to go to the next one?
[01:47:31.800 --> 01:47:32.800]  Yeah.
[01:47:32.800 --> 01:47:39.400]  This one's from Bradley D. Rose and it's the vanishing of the bees, the EPA and Big Pharma.
[01:47:39.400 --> 01:47:42.920]  And you know, here's a here's a good example of, you know, using green screen with some
[01:47:42.920 --> 01:47:43.920]  really nice.
[01:47:43.920 --> 01:47:45.360]  Very professionalist voice is great.
[01:47:45.360 --> 01:47:46.360]  The topic is key.
[01:47:46.360 --> 01:47:49.080]  We won't have time to play the whole thing, but here's a few minutes of it.
[01:47:49.080 --> 01:47:54.000]  And then we come back with a very well spoken reporter with machine guns.
[01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:56.080]  We're not playing it because she's in a bikini.
[01:47:56.080 --> 01:48:08.800]  Here it is.
[01:48:08.800 --> 01:48:13.680]  I'm Bradley D. Rajay reporting for info wars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[01:48:13.680 --> 01:48:19.560]  And this is gut check, a weekly, unflinching look at the stuff that really matters in
[01:48:19.560 --> 01:48:21.120]  your world.
[01:48:21.120 --> 01:48:26.200]  Since 2006, something odd and alarming has been happening to commercial beehives throughout
[01:48:26.200 --> 01:48:28.360]  the United States.
[01:48:28.360 --> 01:48:33.360]  Beekeepers returning to these hives find that the bees are completely gone, vanished without
[01:48:33.360 --> 01:48:34.760]  a trace.
[01:48:34.760 --> 01:48:39.880]  This phenomenon has been labeled CCD or Colony Collapse Disorder.
[01:48:39.880 --> 01:48:46.680]  CCD typically occurs in early winter or spring when the bees that leave the hive to go foraging
[01:48:46.680 --> 01:48:49.560]  for pollen simply do not return.
[01:48:49.560 --> 01:48:55.760]  The hives appear to be normal, with active queens developing many brood, with ample food
[01:48:55.760 --> 01:48:56.760]  stores.
[01:48:56.760 --> 01:48:59.040]  They just simply leave and don't come back.
[01:48:59.040 --> 01:49:03.480]  This pattern is followed by the rest of the hive and with no apparent reason.
[01:49:03.480 --> 01:49:08.720]  The vacant hives have had active queens developing many brood and the hives are well stocked
[01:49:08.720 --> 01:49:14.280]  with food and has been reported to have affected nearly one third of all commercially managed
[01:49:14.280 --> 01:49:15.920]  hives.
[01:49:15.920 --> 01:49:22.600]  This is particularly disturbing when you consider that 76% of all food production and 84% of
[01:49:22.600 --> 01:49:27.480]  all plant species rely on bees for pollination.
[01:49:27.480 --> 01:49:32.080]  Imagine for just a moment what would happen globally if over a few short years, three
[01:49:32.080 --> 01:49:38.240]  quarters of the food to be grown, harvested and consumed was completely gone.
[01:49:38.240 --> 01:49:43.600]  The inevitable riots, famines and wars that would occur would be of such an astronomical
[01:49:43.600 --> 01:49:47.880]  proportion it would dwarf anything that we have seen in modern times.
[01:49:47.880 --> 01:49:53.000]  The loss of life would be measured in billions, that's right I said billions with a capital
[01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:58.480]  B and the devastation would not just affect humans, all creatures that walk and swim on
[01:49:58.480 --> 01:50:03.040]  earth would be affected by this food circle of life.
[01:50:03.040 --> 01:50:07.800]  There have been many theories on how CCD came into being and how it works.
[01:50:07.800 --> 01:50:12.800]  Some studies show wide ranging ideas and testing that has provided partial answers, but until
[01:50:12.800 --> 01:50:20.120]  now no concrete link has been scientifically proven that connects CCD to this mystery cause.
[01:50:20.120 --> 01:50:27.440]  Alright and the full report is at infowars.com vanishing of the bees, the EPA and big pharma.
[01:50:27.440 --> 01:50:31.480]  I like what he did, he needs to re-upload it though, but the fact that there's a lot
[01:50:31.480 --> 01:50:36.680]  of typos in this, that means I think he's doing it on purpose to be like us.
[01:50:36.680 --> 01:50:37.680]  No comment.
[01:50:37.680 --> 01:50:41.840]  No, I mean I think John Baum is just saying he's one of us, this guy may actually have
[01:50:41.840 --> 01:50:42.840]  joined the team.
[01:50:42.840 --> 01:50:43.840]  He may.
[01:50:43.840 --> 01:50:44.840]  I mean sir.
[01:50:44.840 --> 01:50:45.840]  It was a great piece though.
[01:50:45.840 --> 01:50:48.600]  No no no, great delivery, great info, great research.
[01:50:48.600 --> 01:50:49.600]  Check your typos.
[01:50:49.600 --> 01:50:53.360]  Check your typos everybody, us included, we're having a typo meeting today after the show
[01:50:53.360 --> 01:50:54.360]  actually.

[01:54:10.440 --> 01:54:15.040]  All right, third hour coming up with your phone calls and giant news.
[01:54:15.040 --> 01:54:16.880]  I've got to get to all this news.
[01:54:16.880 --> 01:54:22.000]  Police launch abusive midnight wake up calls at 4 a.m.
[01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:23.760]  Wait to hear about that.
[01:54:23.760 --> 01:54:25.960]  And by the way, the police don't like it.
[01:54:25.960 --> 01:54:28.160]  They're complaining, but they're being ordered to do it.
[01:54:28.160 --> 01:54:30.080]  That's what this tyranny is all about.
[01:54:30.080 --> 01:54:35.360]  We've got big breaking news from Paul Joseph Watson at infowars.com and Steve Watson also
[01:54:35.360 --> 01:54:37.560]  was part of the report.
[01:54:37.560 --> 01:54:44.080]  This secretly prepares to evacuate Chicago during NATO summit, standby shelters ready
[01:54:44.080 --> 01:54:45.080]  for residence.
[01:54:45.080 --> 01:54:49.040]  Now, this next clip, I've always made the point that they use like Miss America and
[01:54:49.040 --> 01:54:54.320]  stuff to sell you in world government, anti-family, they tell them to have those messages to win.
[01:54:54.320 --> 01:54:58.360]  And I've always made the point that, you know, bikini girls with machine guns is what'll
[01:54:58.360 --> 01:54:59.720]  sell the Second Amendment.
[01:54:59.720 --> 01:55:04.360]  And no, that's not what we're exactly looking for in the reporter thing, but it is interesting.
[01:55:04.360 --> 01:55:06.400]  And it does make some good points.
[01:55:06.400 --> 01:55:10.320]  And this is what's going to really get the general public into the Second Amendment.
[01:55:10.320 --> 01:55:11.320]  And this is what's happening.
[01:55:11.320 --> 01:55:14.640]  In fact, what's that punk rock song, bikini girls and machine guns?
[01:55:14.640 --> 01:55:16.520]  The point is, is that this is a very...
[01:55:16.520 --> 01:55:22.280]  The dimension of bikini girls with machine guns.
[01:55:22.280 --> 01:55:23.280]  It's the cramps.
[01:55:23.280 --> 01:55:24.280]  Turn it up.
[01:55:24.280 --> 01:55:32.560]  Then we'll get into all the serious news there, but we've got to have some fun.
[01:55:32.560 --> 01:55:39.560]  Bikini girls with machine guns.
[01:55:39.560 --> 01:55:42.560]  All work and no play makes an infall warrior a dull boy.
[01:55:42.560 --> 01:55:47.600]  Yeah, no, but it's just fun to make the Second Amendment exciting and to get young people
[01:55:47.600 --> 01:55:49.280]  period involved in it.
[01:55:49.280 --> 01:55:52.920]  Yeah, I believe Amanda Liberty is 20 years old is what they said.
[01:55:52.920 --> 01:55:57.400]  Yeah, so this video is up at infallwars.com in the contest area as well, along with all
[01:55:57.400 --> 01:55:58.400]  the...
[01:55:58.400 --> 01:56:00.400]  And we're going to be airing these every day, at least three every day.
[01:56:00.400 --> 01:56:03.080]  Now, we've just got enough time to play this before we go to break.
[01:56:03.080 --> 01:56:08.240]  Here is that report of her listening on radio, XM166, however you're listening, go to infallwars.com
[01:56:08.240 --> 01:56:09.240]  to watch the video.
[01:56:09.240 --> 01:56:10.240]  Here it is.
[01:56:10.240 --> 01:56:19.080]  Love the sound of the machine guns.
[01:56:19.080 --> 01:56:20.080]  Sound of freedom.
[01:56:20.080 --> 01:56:23.080]  Hi, my name is Amanda.
[01:56:23.080 --> 01:56:30.680]  I may only be 20 years old, but I can see what is going on in our country.
[01:56:30.680 --> 01:56:34.440]  I have one of these because the government can't and won't protect you.
[01:56:34.440 --> 01:56:38.720]  We are now a nation known to start wars.
[01:56:38.720 --> 01:56:42.440]  We feel compelled because of our insecurity that we have to go over to these other countries
[01:56:42.440 --> 01:56:44.440]  to maintain our empire.
[01:56:44.440 --> 01:56:49.360]  I'd like you to see what I see.
[01:56:49.360 --> 01:56:53.800]  This is important, so please pay attention.
[01:56:53.800 --> 01:56:56.760]  Basically, our country and way of life is under attack.
[01:56:56.760 --> 01:56:59.880]  Our government has been undermined by a group of criminals.
[01:56:59.880 --> 01:57:05.360]  Know that sounds unlikely, but if you look at the facts, it's plain as day.
[01:57:05.360 --> 01:57:08.640]  You cannot get the truth from typical TV news.
[01:57:08.640 --> 01:57:10.400]  They are lying to us.
[01:57:10.400 --> 01:57:18.800]  There are precious few sources for current news that isn't propaganda.
[01:57:18.800 --> 01:57:23.040]  Alex Jones of Info Wars is someone who we the people he trusts.
[01:57:23.040 --> 01:57:27.880]  Alex Jones hosts the real news online and broadcasts on the radio.
[01:57:27.880 --> 01:57:29.880]  He always tells the truth.
[01:57:29.880 --> 01:57:31.800]  Listen to Alex and his guests.
[01:57:31.800 --> 01:57:34.360]  These people are trying to help America.
[01:57:34.360 --> 01:57:49.520]  You can watch Alex Jones at infowars.com or you can see him on YouTube.
[01:57:49.520 --> 01:57:50.520]  Yeah, no, absolutely.
[01:57:50.520 --> 01:57:57.840]  I want to see the target she's shooting, but expanding on that, Rob, again, that's the
[01:57:57.840 --> 01:58:01.920]  perfect type of group where they could just hurt her boyfriend that shot that and produced
[01:58:01.920 --> 01:58:04.640]  that where they could be correspondents in Florida.
[01:58:04.640 --> 01:58:06.600]  I know he also works for one of the sportsman channels.
[01:58:06.600 --> 01:58:07.600]  He was telling us.
[01:58:07.600 --> 01:58:08.600]  Totally.
[01:58:08.600 --> 01:58:10.100]  But I mean, but we need correspondence.
[01:58:10.100 --> 01:58:11.320]  The thing is we need to raise the funds.
[01:58:11.320 --> 01:58:12.640]  We're going to actually pay him something.
[01:58:12.640 --> 01:58:13.640]  Yeah.
[01:58:13.640 --> 01:58:16.720]  But again, we're looking for two reporters in house, but also stuff like that.
[01:58:16.720 --> 01:58:21.480]  Perfect to have a gun review or something like that where we can have people in other
[01:58:21.480 --> 01:58:23.600]  states that follow the reports.
[01:58:23.600 --> 01:58:25.280]  Great job to you guys.
[01:58:25.280 --> 01:58:26.280]  Very exciting.
[01:58:26.280 --> 01:58:30.160]  Another wonderful submission, third hour coming up.
[01:58:30.160 --> 01:58:31.160]  Thank you so much, Rob.
[01:58:31.160 --> 01:58:32.160]  We'll have more tomorrow.
[01:58:32.160 --> 01:58:33.160]  Oh, yeah.
[01:58:33.160 --> 01:58:34.160]  We got hundreds of these.
[01:58:34.160 --> 01:58:37.160]  That's a nice sampling of them, and they're just rolling in.
[01:58:37.160 --> 01:58:45.440]  I'm Alex Jones of infowars.com, hardcore news coming up, hour number three, G.C.N.

[01:59:03.120 --> 01:59:12.120]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[01:59:12.120 --> 01:59:19.240]  They're so bright in every stitch guarantee you love the way they fit.
[01:59:19.240 --> 01:59:25.320]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[01:59:25.320 --> 01:59:30.280]  Blue diamond gussets got it, others don't.

[02:00:11.680 --> 02:00:13.840]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.840 --> 02:00:18.000]  He's Alex Jones on the G.C.N. Radio Network.
[02:00:18.000 --> 02:00:25.000]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:25.000 --> 02:00:37.240]  All right, we're into hour number three here.
[02:00:37.240 --> 02:00:40.440]  I've got to be disciplined.
[02:00:40.440 --> 02:00:45.640]  We'll take 30 minutes of calls here and then I'll get into the big news.
[02:00:45.640 --> 02:00:46.640]  There's a lot of it.
[02:00:46.640 --> 02:00:50.240]  The news I haven't covered yet in the breaking news.
[02:00:50.240 --> 02:00:52.240]  Right now, let's go to Carl in Oregon.
[02:00:52.240 --> 02:00:53.240]  Thanks for holding Carl.
[02:00:53.240 --> 02:00:54.240]  Hey, what up, dude?
[02:00:54.240 --> 02:00:55.240]  Hey, man.
[02:00:55.240 --> 02:00:56.240]  How you doing?
[02:00:56.240 --> 02:01:00.240]  What do you think of those submissions to the InfoWars contest?
[02:01:00.240 --> 02:01:02.480]  That looks pretty cool, dude.
[02:01:02.480 --> 02:01:04.360]  I got to get me one of those.
[02:01:04.360 --> 02:01:06.440]  One of those machine guns?
[02:01:06.440 --> 02:01:07.440]  Yeah.
[02:01:07.440 --> 02:01:08.440]  Machine gun girl.
[02:01:08.440 --> 02:01:09.440]  Yeah.
[02:01:09.440 --> 02:01:10.440]  She's number one on my list.
[02:01:10.440 --> 02:01:12.640]  I put her in top of the running if it was me.
[02:01:12.640 --> 02:01:15.480]  Well, I think what we're going to do is we're going to take some of the finalists if we
[02:01:15.480 --> 02:01:18.480]  can get our little cheap poll system on InfoWars to work, right?
[02:01:18.480 --> 02:01:20.920]  Because usually we get like 30,000 votes in two days.
[02:01:20.920 --> 02:01:24.440]  Now, it's like 1,000, so something's wrong with it, but we're about to get a new polling
[02:01:24.440 --> 02:01:25.440]  system.
[02:01:25.440 --> 02:01:29.720]  And so we can have like five videos at a time and then I can say, okay, who do you vote
[02:01:29.720 --> 02:01:31.560]  for out of this group of five?
[02:01:31.560 --> 02:01:37.120]  And then I'll kind of let that narrow it down and then I'll pick because we've got hundreds
[02:01:37.120 --> 02:01:38.120]  of these videos.
[02:01:38.120 --> 02:01:39.520]  I don't know what we're going to do.
[02:01:39.520 --> 02:01:40.520]  Awesome, dude.
[02:01:40.520 --> 02:01:41.520]  Famous quote.
[02:01:41.520 --> 02:01:46.520]  I'm as mad as hell and I'm not going to take this anymore.
[02:01:46.520 --> 02:01:49.520]  Howard Beale Network, 1976.
[02:01:49.520 --> 02:01:50.520]  Awesome.
[02:01:50.520 --> 02:02:00.320]  Yeah, I had a question and about Kevin Trudeau, the guy that you had on about two and a half
[02:02:00.320 --> 02:02:01.320]  years ago.
[02:02:01.320 --> 02:02:06.720]  I paid for a book, sent a check in to get his natural cures that the government doesn't
[02:02:06.720 --> 02:02:08.120]  want you to know.
[02:02:08.120 --> 02:02:11.560]  I never got it and I never even got my check back.
[02:02:11.560 --> 02:02:15.760]  Do you know how he's doing these days and is it possible I can get that book?
[02:02:15.760 --> 02:02:20.920]  Yeah, I'm sorry when we have guests on sometimes and they plug something, I can't be responsible
[02:02:20.920 --> 02:02:21.920]  for what's happening.
[02:02:21.920 --> 02:02:25.880]  I know he's had a lot of troubles with the government and all sorts of other stuff and
[02:02:25.880 --> 02:02:30.640]  I had him on just because the government was trying to shut him down as a guest a few times,
[02:02:30.640 --> 02:02:34.840]  but I don't really know Kevin very well.
[02:02:34.840 --> 02:02:37.240]  So I'm sorry to hear that happened to you, sir.
[02:02:37.240 --> 02:02:41.480]  Yeah, so I've been trying to recover from this at that point, but now I'm trying to
[02:02:41.480 --> 02:02:43.080]  call to get the longevity products.
[02:02:43.080 --> 02:02:46.200]  Can you go ahead and fire out the correct number for me to call so I can order the beyond
[02:02:46.200 --> 02:02:49.920]  tangy tangerine and be pollen burst and rebound?
[02:02:49.920 --> 02:02:50.920]  Yes, sir.
[02:02:50.920 --> 02:02:54.840]  Guys, we put in FullWarsTeam.com upon screen, I meant to plug that in the last two hours
[02:02:54.840 --> 02:02:55.840]  and look at the difference.
[02:02:55.840 --> 02:03:00.960]  I've lost 40 plus pounds and it's not even meant to be a weight loss, but we heard Ben
[02:03:00.960 --> 02:03:04.720]  Fuchs, pharmacist Ben Fuchs and others about a year ago, I was already promoted because
[02:03:04.720 --> 02:03:09.320]  I know it was really good and Ted had a big response with it with several of the products.
[02:03:09.320 --> 02:03:11.760]  He took their joint care stuff and it really helped.
[02:03:11.760 --> 02:03:17.240]  He was going to have surgery on his knee and so Aaron got on it and has now lost 90 plus
[02:03:17.240 --> 02:03:18.240]  pounds.
[02:03:18.240 --> 02:03:21.560]  In fact, I told him, okay, now it's time to stop just because I eat the tangy tangerine
[02:03:21.560 --> 02:03:24.240]  pollen burst rebound and stuff.
[02:03:24.240 --> 02:03:25.960]  It's just a liquid drink.
[02:03:25.960 --> 02:03:29.120]  It makes you drink more water and stuff like that.
[02:03:29.120 --> 02:03:35.120]  And if you go to the website, infowarsteam.com, you can get big discounts on all of it there
[02:03:35.120 --> 02:03:36.120]  on the site.
[02:03:36.120 --> 02:03:37.840]  You can sign up, become a distributor and get discounts.
[02:03:37.840 --> 02:03:41.520]  You can sign up for the auto ship and qualify for that and get free shipping.
[02:03:41.520 --> 02:03:50.840]  The number is 877-551-1301, 877-551-1301 and that's infowarsteam.com.
[02:03:50.840 --> 02:03:54.840]  It's also a business opportunity if you want to become a distributor and we are formed
[02:03:54.840 --> 02:03:58.440]  up phone teams and people that are part of that to answer the questions.
[02:03:58.440 --> 02:04:02.560]  My dad like a year ago was like, yeah, I'll write another vitamin and then he saw my mom
[02:04:02.560 --> 02:04:06.000]  get on it and have all these great responses but just beyond tangy tangerine.
[02:04:06.000 --> 02:04:08.080]  Now he's doing it, totally sold on it.
[02:04:08.080 --> 02:04:11.360]  He's a dentist and he's out there promoting it.
[02:04:11.360 --> 02:04:17.920]  So again, infowarsteam.com, try it and become a believer.
[02:04:17.920 --> 02:04:21.560]  All I know is I take beyond tangy tangerine at least four times a day.
[02:04:21.560 --> 02:04:25.280]  They say take it twice a day, four scoops, two scoops per serving.
[02:04:25.280 --> 02:04:32.080]  I do like one scoop four times a day that's the daily allowance they recommend and because
[02:04:32.080 --> 02:04:36.400]  I don't like it that strong and I end up drinking more water, it's just good all around.
[02:04:36.400 --> 02:04:38.440]  The rebound's great when I want to really work out hard.
[02:04:38.440 --> 02:04:44.800]  Somebody's going to work out twice now and then the polymers is amazing, super B vitamin
[02:04:44.800 --> 02:04:48.160]  and other vitamin, turbo charge, a bunch of minerals.
[02:04:48.160 --> 02:04:49.160]  It's awesome.
[02:04:49.160 --> 02:04:52.040]  There's a bunch of other products, infowarsteam.com.

[02:07:00.800 --> 02:07:05.440]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:07:05.440 --> 02:07:09.760]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:07:09.760 --> 02:07:14.080]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company
[02:07:14.080 --> 02:07:15.400]  allows you to have.
[02:07:15.400 --> 02:07:16.400]  It's true.
[02:07:16.400 --> 02:07:21.160]  There's no government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:07:21.160 --> 02:07:25.480]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:07:25.480 --> 02:07:29.480]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:07:29.480 --> 02:07:32.960]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:07:32.960 --> 02:07:36.680]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[02:07:36.680 --> 02:07:41.400]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[02:07:41.400 --> 02:07:45.200]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science,
[02:07:45.200 --> 02:07:46.600]  one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:07:46.600 --> 02:07:50.840]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:07:50.840 --> 02:07:52.480]  That's mysolarbackup.com.

[02:08:01.680 --> 02:08:08.320]  Ease the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:08.320 --> 02:08:12.880]  Okay, I want to run through a whole bunch of your phone calls.
[02:08:12.880 --> 02:08:15.840]  Then, I want to get into the news here.
[02:08:15.840 --> 02:08:20.800]  More Americans than projected filed jobless claims last week, and now the Democratic Party
[02:08:20.800 --> 02:08:24.560]  is saying, vote for Obama, not so that you get a job.
[02:08:24.560 --> 02:08:29.480]  He already promised everybody jobs, free houses, free cars, milk and honey, but all he did
[02:08:29.480 --> 02:08:34.440]  was deliver tens of trillions of dollars offshore banks, crime syndicate, and core designs
[02:08:34.440 --> 02:08:36.760]  allowed to steal billions and not get in trouble.
[02:08:36.760 --> 02:08:43.280]  So Obama, President Obama, is now saying, vote for him to have your jobless benefits
[02:08:43.280 --> 02:08:44.280]  extended.
[02:08:44.280 --> 02:08:46.840]  Yeah, and then bankrupt all the businesses.
[02:08:46.840 --> 02:08:53.080]  They'll get a job somewhere for a month, quit, get unemployment for five years or whatever.
[02:08:53.080 --> 02:08:54.760]  Not like you can even live on that.
[02:08:54.760 --> 02:08:58.320]  It's the new economy, exactly where the bankers want you because that brings the country deeper
[02:08:58.320 --> 02:08:59.360]  into debt.
[02:08:59.360 --> 02:09:04.840]  And big breaking news by Paul Joseph Watson, I'm going to cover after I get to more of
[02:09:04.840 --> 02:09:06.720]  your calls in detail.
[02:09:06.720 --> 02:09:11.160]  Government secretly prepares to evacuate Chicago during NATO summit, standby shelters
[02:09:11.160 --> 02:09:12.800]  ready for residents.
[02:09:12.800 --> 02:09:16.920]  A leak directive issued by the Red Cross indicates that the federal government has prepared
[02:09:16.920 --> 02:09:19.280]  plans to evacuate Chicago during the NATO summit.
[02:09:19.280 --> 02:09:23.320]  Yeah, they use every event now as a little martial law federalization drill.
[02:09:23.320 --> 02:09:29.160]  And all over the world, G20 and NATO, they tell the country how to run the operation.
[02:09:29.160 --> 02:09:30.160]  So it's about globalism.
[02:09:30.160 --> 02:09:32.400]  It's about standardization.
[02:09:32.400 --> 02:09:36.600]  An email sent to Red Cross volunteers in Milwaukee area notes that NATO summit in May
[02:09:36.600 --> 02:09:41.560]  could create unrest or another national security incident.
[02:09:41.560 --> 02:09:46.360]  The American Red Cross in southeastern Wisconsin has been asked to place a number of shelters
[02:09:46.360 --> 02:09:49.000]  on standby in the event of an evacuation of Chicago.
[02:09:49.000 --> 02:09:53.760]  The email, which was leaked to CBS reach where the feds getting ready to blow something
[02:09:53.760 --> 02:09:59.200]  up so they can pose a savior talking about that more.
[02:09:59.200 --> 02:10:02.520]  And police launch abusive midnight wake up calls.
[02:10:02.520 --> 02:10:07.400]  Police in Virginia have announced an initiative for officers on midnight shifts to knock on
[02:10:07.400 --> 02:10:10.240]  your door between 12 a.m. and 4 a.m.
[02:10:10.240 --> 02:10:14.200]  If they don't think your car's parked properly or whatever and demand you come talk to them.
[02:10:14.200 --> 02:10:19.240]  Just all part of the midnight visit for everyone needs to get a TSA grope or a police officer
[02:10:19.240 --> 02:10:20.240]  visit.
[02:10:20.240 --> 02:10:23.840]  And I've seen other reports where if your door's not locked, the police will come in.
[02:10:23.840 --> 02:10:26.040]  In fact, that's not in the World Net Daily article.
[02:10:26.040 --> 02:10:27.040]  You guys searched that.
[02:10:27.040 --> 02:10:29.920]  I know I've seen it probably 50 times in the last few years.
[02:10:29.920 --> 02:10:31.240]  It's all federally standardized.
[02:10:31.240 --> 02:10:32.800]  All cops are all feds.
[02:10:32.800 --> 02:10:33.800]  They don't even know it.
[02:10:33.800 --> 02:10:36.560]  You know, the police chief just told them what to do with federal grants.
[02:10:36.560 --> 02:10:40.560]  Police to inner homes if door unlocked.
[02:10:40.560 --> 02:10:41.560]  Something like that.
[02:10:41.560 --> 02:10:42.680]  And it's all part of this.
[02:10:42.680 --> 02:10:47.240]  The crime's exploding not because of the giant welfare state or 7 million in prison training
[02:10:47.240 --> 02:10:51.560]  everybody how to be a criminal or the fact that we're run by criminals.
[02:10:51.560 --> 02:10:57.160]  No, there's crime because you don't have your door locked, which again is an excuse for
[02:10:57.160 --> 02:11:01.800]  police to creep around your house at night and try to open your door and look in your
[02:11:01.800 --> 02:11:02.800]  window.
[02:11:02.800 --> 02:11:05.760]  Now they have this thing where they claim, oh, 911 call to your house.
[02:11:05.760 --> 02:11:07.680]  We're coming in without a warrant.
[02:11:07.680 --> 02:11:09.080]  Then they take your guns.
[02:11:09.080 --> 02:11:10.880]  I see that all the time.
[02:11:10.880 --> 02:11:12.880]  Let's go ahead and go to Ryan in Alaska.
[02:11:12.880 --> 02:11:14.880]  Ryan, thank you for holding.
[02:11:14.880 --> 02:11:15.880]  Yes, sir.
[02:11:15.880 --> 02:11:23.080]  Hi, you were talking about operation of Mountain Guardian and the use of the stadium in an
[02:11:23.080 --> 02:11:24.080]  emergency.
[02:11:24.080 --> 02:11:25.880]  And I'd like to speak to that.
[02:11:25.880 --> 02:11:27.880]  Yes, sir.
[02:11:27.880 --> 02:11:28.880]  Go ahead.
[02:11:28.880 --> 02:11:33.080]  The first thing I would like to say is a quote from a film you were in, Camp FEMA.
[02:11:33.080 --> 02:11:34.080]  Yes.
[02:11:34.080 --> 02:11:39.800]  An elderly Japanese man who was in a internment camp in America during World War II.
[02:11:39.800 --> 02:11:44.720]  He says they didn't have the facilities to house 120,000 persons.
[02:11:44.720 --> 02:11:48.600]  So they took over racetracks, fairgrounds, places like that.
[02:11:48.600 --> 02:11:54.920]  And we didn't have football stadiums and NBA stadiums and major baseball fields like
[02:11:54.920 --> 02:11:56.760]  we do now back then.
[02:11:56.760 --> 02:12:00.360]  No, they admit that that's what the sports stadiums are for.
[02:12:00.360 --> 02:12:05.120]  They admit in the Emergency Centers Act and all these other acts, the civilian inmate
[02:12:05.120 --> 02:12:09.480]  labor camp program that they're training to lock up several million political dissidents
[02:12:09.480 --> 02:12:11.200]  and of course take your property.
[02:12:11.200 --> 02:12:12.560]  That's always the funnest part.
[02:12:12.560 --> 02:12:15.640]  And they're hiring lots of little criminals who want to do it.
[02:12:15.640 --> 02:12:19.440]  And the globalists don't care if those little criminals get killed trying to put us all
[02:12:19.440 --> 02:12:20.440]  in camps.
[02:12:20.440 --> 02:12:23.720]  That's all part of the fun because then the Russian troops can be brought in.
[02:12:23.720 --> 02:12:24.720]  That's right.
[02:12:24.720 --> 02:12:32.040]  Mainstream news, Russian troops in America up at infowars.com, training to take on the
[02:12:32.040 --> 02:12:39.400]  American people and more TSA have been caught this time trying to ship in 10 pounds of cocaine.
[02:12:39.400 --> 02:12:40.400]  Go ahead.
[02:12:40.400 --> 02:12:41.400]  I'm sorry.
[02:12:41.400 --> 02:12:43.320]  I have a list of verifiable.
[02:12:43.320 --> 02:12:47.440]  Anyone can go to Google and type in these country names next to prison camp stadium and
[02:12:47.440 --> 02:12:48.440]  it'll bring it up.
[02:12:48.440 --> 02:12:49.440]  It's all historical.
[02:12:49.440 --> 02:12:53.960]  I've got 12 countries here that for sure have turned stadiums into prison camps.
[02:12:53.960 --> 02:12:54.960]  I'll read it real quick.
[02:12:54.960 --> 02:13:01.600]  We got Chile, Germany, France, the U.S., Rwanda, India, Trinidad, Mexico, Japan, Libya, Syria,
[02:13:01.600 --> 02:13:02.600]  and Sarajevo.
[02:13:02.600 --> 02:13:03.600]  And they're those people.
[02:13:03.600 --> 02:13:04.600]  Yes, sir.
[02:13:04.600 --> 02:13:05.600]  They always do.
[02:13:05.600 --> 02:13:06.600]  Afghanistan did.
[02:13:06.600 --> 02:13:08.080]  The Cuban communists did.
[02:13:08.080 --> 02:13:10.280]  I mean, hundreds, all of them do it.
[02:13:10.280 --> 02:13:15.320]  In the movie Red Dawn, because it's just well-known, so in a fiction movie, they're held at the
[02:13:15.320 --> 02:13:20.240]  local football stadium, remember, and they've got all the movies playing and brainwashing
[02:13:20.240 --> 02:13:22.920]  and America and the founding fathers are pigs.
[02:13:22.920 --> 02:13:25.160]  Well, you don't need to be in a sports stadium now.
[02:13:25.160 --> 02:13:29.880]  You turn on the news and the founding fathers are pigs and the free market is a cesspit.
[02:13:29.880 --> 02:13:32.720]  We live in a giant reeducation camp.
[02:13:32.720 --> 02:13:34.600]  We live in a giant reeducation camp.
[02:13:34.600 --> 02:13:39.120]  I mean, they're telling parents your children can't do chores and we're going to take your
[02:13:39.120 --> 02:13:43.200]  DNA at school without your consent and we're going to give them shots without your consent.
[02:13:43.200 --> 02:13:45.760]  All of it, lawless, scum, criminal government.
[02:13:45.760 --> 02:13:51.240]  I mean, again, you get around these government people, they think they're God.
[02:13:51.240 --> 02:13:56.240]  You understand the CPS, the biggest private contractors for CPS to take people's kids
[02:13:56.240 --> 02:13:59.840]  outside of real courts is Dinecore.
[02:13:59.840 --> 02:14:04.000]  Dinecore has been caught in congressional hearings and worldwide running giant child
[02:14:04.000 --> 02:14:06.200]  kidnapping rings.
[02:14:06.200 --> 02:14:09.040]  I mean, this is who runs America.
[02:14:09.040 --> 02:14:14.360]  The most vile scum the planet could even comprehend.
[02:14:14.360 --> 02:14:15.360]  We are hijacked.
[02:14:15.360 --> 02:14:16.360]  I'm sorry.
[02:14:16.360 --> 02:14:18.200]  Anything else on the sports stadiums?
[02:14:18.200 --> 02:14:21.480]  Just type in FEMA does drill at sports stadium.
[02:14:21.480 --> 02:14:24.040]  FEMA practices putting people in sports stadium.
[02:14:24.040 --> 02:14:25.120]  I mean, it's all there.
[02:14:25.120 --> 02:14:30.160]  They say in the emergency centers establishment act that they will take people to sports stadiums
[02:14:30.160 --> 02:14:34.640]  and then the really bad folks, they want to really torture good.
[02:14:34.640 --> 02:14:38.160]  They fly out or bus out or diesel out.
[02:14:38.160 --> 02:14:39.960]  We went last year to Denver.
[02:14:39.960 --> 02:14:45.240]  They practice taking the elementary schools kids to the Denver stadium and the cops came
[02:14:45.240 --> 02:14:47.600]  over and said, don't film this.
[02:14:47.600 --> 02:14:49.320]  That wasn't even announced in the media.
[02:14:49.320 --> 02:14:53.280]  We have video of them all over the country.
[02:14:53.280 --> 02:14:55.680]  They're saying, we're going to take your kid during a disaster.
[02:14:55.680 --> 02:14:56.680]  You can't pick them up.
[02:14:56.680 --> 02:15:01.440]  Yeah, there's Darren McBreen at the Denver Broncos deal, Mile High Stadium where they
[02:15:01.440 --> 02:15:02.440]  take the kids.
[02:15:02.440 --> 02:15:04.360]  I mean, this is America.
[02:15:04.360 --> 02:15:06.440]  This is not a joke.
[02:15:06.440 --> 02:15:08.560]  I'm sorry, is there anything else?
[02:15:08.560 --> 02:15:13.720]  FEMA press release from 2007, just after Hurricane Katrina, they say, or they're talking about
[02:15:13.720 --> 02:15:18.960]  on baseball fields that had been used as camps and they're bragging about turning them back
[02:15:18.960 --> 02:15:21.600]  over to the community and how they fixed them all up afterwards.
[02:15:21.600 --> 02:15:26.360]  And a few real quick quotes from that is, the softball field was used as an emergency
[02:15:26.360 --> 02:15:29.920]  temporary housing site for nearly 40 families after Katrina.
[02:15:29.920 --> 02:15:33.440]  Next paragraph is the parks and recreation director receives regular help from Jerry
[02:15:33.440 --> 02:15:36.400]  Harper, a FEMA contractor monitor.
[02:15:36.400 --> 02:15:40.320]  And then later on, it says eight of the 12 closed parks that temporarily housed more
[02:15:40.320 --> 02:15:41.520]  than 600 families.
[02:15:41.520 --> 02:15:46.120]  And that's just one example from a FEMA press release.
[02:15:46.120 --> 02:15:52.440]  And the countries I had mentioned earlier with the stadium camps in India, Mexico, Japan,
[02:15:52.440 --> 02:15:56.480]  and Libya and Syria, those are just within the past two years that that's happening.
[02:15:56.480 --> 02:16:01.040]  Well, you know, it's freedom to have your kids taken to the sports stadium and they're
[02:16:01.040 --> 02:16:02.040]  just trying to keep us safe.
[02:16:02.040 --> 02:16:06.720]  I mean, anytime somebody sees somebody with a gun, they'll shut down a whole neighborhood
[02:16:06.720 --> 02:16:07.720]  now.
[02:16:07.720 --> 02:16:10.560]  It's all about staying in your homes, remain calm.
[02:16:10.560 --> 02:16:15.480]  They've got daytime curfews, even for adults all over the country now.
[02:16:15.480 --> 02:16:20.320]  Just just training you, just slowly easing you, oh, the Russians are trained to take
[02:16:20.320 --> 02:16:21.320]  you on.
[02:16:21.320 --> 02:16:26.240]  Oh, the government's buying armored mobile pill boxes, oh, 450 million hollow point
[02:16:26.240 --> 02:16:27.240]  rounds.
[02:16:27.240 --> 02:16:28.800]  Oh, all these agencies are getting weapons.
[02:16:28.800 --> 02:16:34.000]  Oh, their Department of Education has created illegal SWAT teams and raids people for unpaid
[02:16:34.000 --> 02:16:35.760]  debts even though there's no law.
[02:16:35.760 --> 02:16:38.920]  They got guns, they're government.
[02:16:38.920 --> 02:16:39.920]  That's the law.
[02:16:39.920 --> 02:16:43.600]  Congress is like it's against the law to launch that war without approval.
[02:16:43.600 --> 02:16:44.600]  Shut up, Congress.
[02:16:44.600 --> 02:16:48.280]  Hey, you're building a giant NSA base, you gotta talk to us about that.
[02:16:48.280 --> 02:16:49.480]  Shut up, Congress.
[02:16:49.480 --> 02:16:53.240]  Hey, you're secretly arresting people, you gotta tell us about that.
[02:16:53.240 --> 02:16:54.240]  Shut up.
[02:16:54.240 --> 02:16:58.360]  The army is standing by and if they won't do what they're told, the Roskies are standing
[02:16:58.360 --> 02:17:01.920]  by.
[02:17:01.920 --> 02:17:04.440]  Russian Spitznets.
[02:17:04.440 --> 02:17:09.320]  Russian troops to target terrorists in America as part of drill, joint U.S. Russian anti-terror
[02:17:09.320 --> 02:17:14.240]  exercise, stokes fears of martial law, fears of martial law.
[02:17:14.240 --> 02:17:17.640]  The law says TSA can't touch your genitals even on the outside.
[02:17:17.640 --> 02:17:19.400]  How do they go inside your pants?
[02:17:19.400 --> 02:17:21.120]  Because it's an emergency.
[02:17:21.120 --> 02:17:22.760]  We're in martial law.
[02:17:22.760 --> 02:17:29.960]  We're on the stovetop in the pot like Bugs Bunny with the pygmies ladling curry sauce
[02:17:29.960 --> 02:17:31.120]  over his head.
[02:17:31.120 --> 02:17:35.880]  We need to get out of the pot, okay?
[02:17:35.880 --> 02:17:38.360]  Let's go ahead and talk to Ryan Alaska.
[02:17:38.360 --> 02:17:39.720]  Thank you, sir, for your call.
[02:17:39.720 --> 02:17:41.640]  Let's now talk to Tom in Pennsylvania.
[02:17:41.640 --> 02:17:42.640]  You're on the air.
[02:17:42.640 --> 02:17:43.640]  Hey, Alex.
[02:17:43.640 --> 02:17:44.640]  How you doing?
[02:17:44.640 --> 02:17:45.640]  Oh, I'm doing great.
[02:17:45.640 --> 02:17:47.640]  Living in the twilight zone, you know.
[02:17:47.640 --> 02:17:55.320]  Hey, on the Russian thing, the first time I heard about this was back in the 80s by
[02:17:55.320 --> 02:17:57.640]  Southwest Radio Church of Oklahoma City.
[02:17:57.640 --> 02:17:59.640]  I don't know if you're familiar with them or not.
[02:17:59.640 --> 02:18:00.640]  Yeah.
[02:18:00.640 --> 02:18:01.640]  I've been on there once as a guest.
[02:18:01.640 --> 02:18:02.640]  Great, great folks.
[02:18:02.640 --> 02:18:03.640]  Okay.
[02:18:03.640 --> 02:18:09.200]  Now, I heard about that in the late 80s about the Spetsnaz, you know, it's a treaty in the
[02:18:09.200 --> 02:18:11.360]  United States and they were put on it.
[02:18:11.360 --> 02:18:12.840]  Listen, I talk to people in the military.
[02:18:12.840 --> 02:18:15.520]  They say they train with them all the time and they say this whole thing with Russia
[02:18:15.520 --> 02:18:16.520]  is fake.
[02:18:16.520 --> 02:18:17.520]  Okay, go ahead.
[02:18:17.520 --> 02:18:25.320]  Now, about 10 years later, I was working with a few Russians and I was, you know, got pretty
[02:18:25.320 --> 02:18:30.080]  friendly with them and I just asked them, he was in the Army, Russian Army.
[02:18:30.080 --> 02:18:35.200]  I just asked him, I said, what do you know about the Spetsnaz here in the United States
[02:18:35.200 --> 02:18:40.800]  and he just started telling me, he says, yes, I know them and they're working with the technology
[02:18:40.800 --> 02:18:44.320]  companies up in New York and so on and so forth.
[02:18:44.320 --> 02:18:48.920]  Yeah, no, I mean, listen, our government doesn't exist.
[02:18:48.920 --> 02:18:54.800]  It's run by Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, who funded Gen 21, who hates America is the target.
[02:18:54.800 --> 02:18:59.600]  They use America to launch all the wars, take all the hate, get in debt while the whole
[02:18:59.600 --> 02:19:02.840]  time, here's the Panama Canal, here's these islands of the Chinese, here's these islands
[02:19:02.840 --> 02:19:03.840]  of the Russians.
[02:19:03.840 --> 02:19:07.960]  Here, here's 20-something billion to ship General Motors out of the country.
[02:19:07.960 --> 02:19:11.840]  I mean, it's just shut down the farms, shut down the factories, harass these people, just
[02:19:11.840 --> 02:19:12.840]  get their guns.
[02:19:12.840 --> 02:19:16.920]  I mean, the government is run by absolute enemies.
[02:19:16.920 --> 02:19:21.520]  I don't know how they, of course the feds blew up Oklahoma City, of course they carried
[02:19:21.520 --> 02:19:22.520]  out 9-11.
[02:19:22.520 --> 02:19:27.120]  It's not the federal government, it's the bankers and they run the Muslim extremists.
[02:19:27.120 --> 02:19:29.640]  They run Al Qaeda publicly now.
[02:19:29.640 --> 02:19:33.960]  You notice they say the war on terror is now over and that the new war is on the returning
[02:19:33.960 --> 02:19:39.080]  vets and libertarians because we're the ones, the libertarians, the constitutionalists, we're
[02:19:39.080 --> 02:19:44.760]  the only Americans left, we're the enemy, we're the enemy because we're common sense,
[02:19:44.760 --> 02:19:50.760]  we're decent, we got red blood ready to defend the Republic, we're the enemy, we're the enemy
[02:19:50.760 --> 02:19:54.240]  and the military's wakin' up so they're now the enemy.
[02:19:54.240 --> 02:20:20.240]  You understand the bankers are gonna detonate nukes and bring in Russians and chai-cogs.

[02:22:56.440 --> 02:22:58.640]  ProEM1, the raw probiotic.
[02:22:58.640 --> 02:23:03.360]  Hey there, you've reached Claire, leave me a message.
[02:23:03.360 --> 02:23:04.360]  Claire, it's Anne.
[02:23:04.360 --> 02:23:08.520]  Hey, you know that hormone balancing product we talked about before, the all natural one.
[02:23:08.520 --> 02:23:13.600]  Ambron, well, I gotta tell you this, not only did Ambron stop my hot flashes, but since
[02:23:13.600 --> 02:23:19.200]  I started the Ambron program, I have lost so much weight, seriously, even my belly
[02:23:19.200 --> 02:23:24.200]  fat, it's gone, I haven't been this thin in years, I feel great, give me a call.
[02:23:24.200 --> 02:23:28.560]  The leading cause of weight gain in women over 40 is hormonal imbalance, until you balance
[02:23:28.560 --> 02:23:31.640]  your hormones, it can be practically impossible to lose weight.
[02:23:31.640 --> 02:23:36.800]  Ambron restores hormonal balance naturally, so the weight can just fall off, yes, even
[02:23:36.800 --> 02:23:41.520]  that stubborn belly fat, plus Ambron eliminates other symptoms of hormonal aging too, so with
[02:23:41.520 --> 02:23:45.760]  your hormones in balance, you can feel great, and finally lose the weight.

[02:24:00.160 --> 02:24:25.160]  Hey, Rob Jacobson, just brought me some really good news from months ago, this is from March
[02:24:25.160 --> 02:24:32.160]  29th, KVUE TV ABC in Austin, UT to get fluoride-free water fountains, the students brought all
[02:24:32.160 --> 02:24:36.320]  the documents and said you're not allowed to put fluoride in our water, they plundered
[02:24:36.320 --> 02:24:41.920]  out all the major government studies admitting it's massively increasing cancer, seven-fold,
[02:24:41.920 --> 02:24:46.720]  in just one type of bone cancer, and the CDC, because their own scientists rebelled, there's
[02:24:46.720 --> 02:24:53.120]  good people in the government, the top is scum run, they had almost every CDC scientist,
[02:24:53.120 --> 02:24:58.120]  CDC, EPA, and FDA, they've had rounds of it over and over in the last 12 years when they
[02:24:58.120 --> 02:25:02.160]  go to Congress and have thousands of their scientists signing documents saying brain
[02:25:02.160 --> 02:25:06.880]  cancer, bone cancer, deadly, it's not just regular fluoride, it's all these other toxins,
[02:25:06.880 --> 02:25:12.560]  they brought this to the University of Texas and pointed out that they've said stop using
[02:25:12.560 --> 02:25:18.760]  it as a pesticide, bioaccumulates, yeah, it's in your food, it's so deadly, and then it's
[02:25:18.760 --> 02:25:22.800]  causing kidney disease, I can't believe I'm reading this in the statesman, this is reality
[02:25:22.800 --> 02:25:29.040]  happening, if we just recognize the total hoax of the new world order, it could all end,
[02:25:29.040 --> 02:25:35.360]  if we just embrace common sense and sanity and say no, the government's never been on
[02:25:35.360 --> 02:25:41.320]  farms telling people their kids can't work, and so what if there was some problem sometimes,
[02:25:41.320 --> 02:25:46.480]  the greater evil is you, you don't have jurisdiction here, scum, the locals will deal with it if
[02:25:46.480 --> 02:25:51.320]  there's a problem, aren't you the government caught bringing drugs in, aren't you working
[02:25:51.320 --> 02:25:57.120]  for farm banks, you traitorous filth, the big thing is stop being scared of them, oh
[02:25:57.120 --> 02:26:01.440]  you're the feds, all these movies, whether these incredibly powerful, cool people, they're
[02:26:01.440 --> 02:26:09.160]  a bunch of scum, excuse me, UT to get fluoride free water fountains, Austin, the University
[02:26:09.160 --> 02:26:13.880]  of Texas will be the first school in the nation to provide fluoride free water fountains,
[02:26:13.880 --> 02:26:18.200]  student government approved the bill, 35 to two Wednesday night to protect women and
[02:26:18.200 --> 02:26:24.520]  African Americans, because it's like in studies, fluoride has like double the effect on Africans
[02:26:24.520 --> 02:26:28.800]  for whatever reason, they're not sure why, but boy it really messes up black folks, let
[02:26:28.800 --> 02:26:33.160]  me continue, and it's really bad for women's thyroid, so it's kind of like Mercury's
[02:26:33.160 --> 02:26:39.560]  worse for boys in all the studies and also in rats, Mercury's worse for male mammals,
[02:26:39.560 --> 02:26:47.120]  but fluoride's worse for women and Africans for whatever reason, so they actually have
[02:26:47.120 --> 02:26:53.200]  some reality here, wow, student government approved the bill, 35 to two Wednesday night
[02:26:53.200 --> 02:26:58.560]  to protect women and African Americans, that's also using political correctness against them,
[02:26:58.560 --> 02:27:02.440]  like oh yeah, you claim you want to help black people and women, well here's the studies,
[02:27:02.440 --> 02:27:09.600]  they're like oh, continuing, studies show these two groups are particularly vulnerable
[02:27:09.600 --> 02:27:16.640]  to fluoride toxicity, I can't believe I'm reading truth out of the local KVUE, I'm having a hallucination
[02:27:16.640 --> 02:27:25.640]  here, hey, hats off to you, I'll tell you, I'll lick KVUE's boots if they would just
[02:27:25.640 --> 02:27:29.880]  do this, I just want to save some lives, hey, let me give you a curtsy right now, hold on,
[02:27:29.880 --> 02:27:37.360]  wide shot please, how do you like that, I bow to you, kneel, bow, in fact I think they
[02:27:37.360 --> 02:27:40.880]  need to get an anti-Skexi award for this right now, please cue up the death of the
[02:27:40.880 --> 02:27:46.240]  Skexi Emperor for us, all right, continuing, because the Skexi Emperor heard he wasn't
[02:27:46.240 --> 02:27:51.800]  gonna be able to fluoride people at UT and suck their soul and he got very upset, continuing,
[02:27:51.800 --> 02:27:59.400]  the EPA and CDC lowered the maximum level of fluoride water by 42% in 2001, that's actually
[02:27:59.400 --> 02:28:04.840]  not accurate, what they said lower it from 1.1 parts per million, I guess that is, 0.7,
[02:28:04.840 --> 02:28:15.000]  I guess that's accurate, so there you go, oh, brain cancer, bone cancer, oh, all these
[02:28:15.000 --> 02:28:19.280]  people getting all these bone diseases like pageants and the rest of it connected directly
[02:28:19.280 --> 02:28:26.360]  to fluoride, but they love their government, drinky, drinky, drinky, all these spinal problems,
[02:28:26.360 --> 02:28:30.800]  spinal burrs, all of it and it's toxic waste, it's not even sodium fluoride, go look it
[02:28:30.800 --> 02:28:37.800]  up, on average over 200 chemicals, some places 300 plus, including lead, mercury, arsenic,
[02:28:37.800 --> 02:28:49.320]  wait, wait, wait, oh, there's more, go read the list, stronium, uranium, radium and the
[02:28:49.320 --> 02:28:56.640]  list of goody goods, again, I'm an extremist, I'm sorry, foreign banks took over the country
[02:28:56.640 --> 02:29:01.440]  and by the 50s and 70 plus percent of the nation were paying millions of dollars in
[02:29:01.440 --> 02:29:06.080]  some cases to buy off local officials to make sure they put this in our water because they
[02:29:06.080 --> 02:29:10.880]  care about our teeth, yeah, and I guess they shot people up with syphilis, including little
[02:29:10.880 --> 02:29:15.800]  kids in Latin America or the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, all over the world causing
[02:29:15.800 --> 02:29:20.440]  giant paralysis, but they don't call it polio, they give you a polio shot and you get paralysis
[02:29:20.440 --> 02:29:25.600]  and a lot of the kids die, 46,000 last year, a lot of most of them can't walk those that
[02:29:25.600 --> 02:29:33.200]  lived, that's nice people, because Bill Gates is nice, I mean, he's a hero and again, I mean
[02:29:33.200 --> 02:29:37.680]  why not have, there's an inside video of a Builderburg group meeting on screen right
[02:29:37.680 --> 02:29:44.280]  now by the way, we'll be right back, stay with us, infowars.com, your call's coming
[02:29:44.280 --> 02:29:50.520]  up tons and tons.

[02:30:03.160 --> 02:30:07.120]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:30:07.120 --> 02:30:11.800]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly
[02:30:11.800 --> 02:30:15.960]  into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[02:30:15.960 --> 02:30:20.600]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[02:30:20.600 --> 02:30:25.840]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver
[02:30:25.840 --> 02:30:32.720]  solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream with continued
[02:30:32.720 --> 02:30:36.160]  legislation threatening the sale of nano-silver products.
[02:30:36.160 --> 02:30:41.760]  You can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:30:41.760 --> 02:30:47.040]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.

[02:31:06.720 --> 02:31:08.880]  Start purifying your water with ProPure.
[02:31:08.880 --> 02:31:13.520]  My friends, I've done a lot of research and the best gravity filter out there, Bar Nun,
[02:31:13.520 --> 02:31:18.040]  is ProPure and it's available discounted at infowars.com.
[02:31:18.040 --> 02:31:21.280]  Its filters are silver and pregnated to prevent bacterial growth.

[02:31:23.200 --> 02:31:25.720]  It's NSF-42 certified.
[02:31:25.720 --> 02:31:30.760]  Optional fluoride filters can reduce fluoride up to 95% easy to set up and use, doesn't
[02:31:30.760 --> 02:31:32.280]  require electricity.
[02:31:32.280 --> 02:31:35.200]  Purify water from lake streams, ponds and wells.
[02:31:35.200 --> 02:31:38.640]  This filter system leaves in beneficial minerals, which is key.
[02:31:38.640 --> 02:31:43.000]  Save money by not buying bottled water and avoid BPA that leaches from the plastic.
[02:31:43.000 --> 02:31:45.440]  ProPure is the best gravity-fed filter out there.
[02:31:45.440 --> 02:31:47.440]  It's what my family uses.
[02:31:47.440 --> 02:31:51.720]  Infowars.com already has the lowest price on ProPure, but if you add the promo code
[02:31:51.720 --> 02:31:55.520]  water at checkout, you get an additional 10% off at infowars.com.

[02:32:00.960 --> 02:32:02.240]  Hi this is Alex Jones.
[02:32:02.240 --> 02:32:06.200]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage
[02:32:06.200 --> 02:32:07.840]  vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[02:32:07.840 --> 02:32:11.880]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver
[02:32:11.880 --> 02:32:12.880]  or gold?
[02:32:12.880 --> 02:32:16.240]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country and it's
[02:32:16.240 --> 02:32:18.400]  possible that could even happen again.
[02:32:18.400 --> 02:32:22.560]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid
[02:32:22.560 --> 02:32:23.620]  seeds.
[02:32:23.620 --> 02:32:28.880]  They call it a survival seed bank and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense
[02:32:28.880 --> 02:32:30.760]  food for you and your family.
[02:32:30.760 --> 02:32:31.840]  And here's the best part.
[02:32:31.840 --> 02:32:36.080]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way and you actually get enough seeds
[02:32:36.080 --> 02:32:38.560]  to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[02:32:38.560 --> 02:32:41.800]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[02:32:41.800 --> 02:32:48.600]  That's survivalseedbank.com or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[02:32:48.600 --> 02:32:52.720]  That's 877-327-0365.
[02:32:52.720 --> 02:33:09.200]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:09.200 --> 02:33:17.520]  Before we get serious and get back to your calls and more news here today, I wanted to
[02:33:17.520 --> 02:33:25.560]  point out that we give people the Skexie Award here from the Dark Crystal when they do something
[02:33:25.560 --> 02:33:28.520]  particularly nasty to humanity.
[02:33:28.520 --> 02:33:32.600]  And I want to give a Skexie Award to those, the two people that voted against the Student
[02:33:32.600 --> 02:33:38.400]  Council to not remove hundreds of deadly chemicals out of the water, including radioactive isotopes
[02:33:38.400 --> 02:33:40.360]  that are put in the Austin water.
[02:33:40.360 --> 02:33:45.560]  Oh yes, in the name of your teeth.
[02:33:45.560 --> 02:33:49.000]  And again, I've been talking about this for years, finally local media, it's happening
[02:33:49.000 --> 02:33:52.400]  all over the country, is checking and going and testing the pipes and saying, this is
[02:33:52.400 --> 02:33:55.560]  60 something times or 20 something times the level of radiation.
[02:33:55.560 --> 02:34:01.560]  They're like, we don't know why it's in the pipes coming out of the water treatment plant.
[02:34:01.560 --> 02:34:02.560]  Never mind.
[02:34:02.560 --> 02:34:04.560]  Well, can we test the fluoride you have?
[02:34:04.560 --> 02:34:05.560]  Nope.
[02:34:05.560 --> 02:34:08.360]  Sandy says that's the homeland security.
[02:34:08.360 --> 02:34:09.360]  That's what they said.
[02:34:09.360 --> 02:34:12.720]  No one's allowed to see that for security.
[02:34:12.720 --> 02:34:17.000]  Even nice people have us put it in the water, you know, they got memos how they want to
[02:34:17.000 --> 02:34:22.840]  give you cancer and sterilize your Rockefeller Foundation, they've moved on to sterilants
[02:34:22.840 --> 02:34:28.320]  in the in the vaccines and GMO, but good old fashioned fluoride.
[02:34:28.320 --> 02:34:33.680]  There's nothing like bone cancer, brain cancer, thyroid disorder and nothing like your wife
[02:34:33.680 --> 02:34:38.880]  going into menopause early and her hair falling out, you know, record numbers of that.
[02:34:38.880 --> 02:34:44.480]  So don't you ask to look at what's in the fluoride sides that don't say what's in it.
[02:34:44.480 --> 02:34:49.840]  Just got a skull and crossbones and everybody knows that means is good.
[02:34:49.840 --> 02:34:52.040]  So no, you can't film in here.
[02:34:52.040 --> 02:34:57.240]  You are allowed to have a tour so you can come into the Austin treatment plant.
[02:34:57.240 --> 02:34:58.240]  It doesn't matter.
[02:34:58.240 --> 02:35:01.280]  We filmed it all anyways and shut her by the skull and crossbones and how the fluoride
[02:35:01.280 --> 02:35:07.360]  drips and eats holes in the concrete and metal in our hidden video report show to those
[02:35:07.360 --> 02:35:12.880]  that voted for keeping the carcinogen filled witches brew in the water.
[02:35:12.880 --> 02:35:15.840]  I give those two against the 35.
[02:35:15.840 --> 02:35:20.000]  You failed, of course, because the worm is turning, the pendulum is swinging, the giant
[02:35:20.000 --> 02:35:24.880]  is awakening, the train left the station, Genie's out of the bottle.
[02:35:24.880 --> 02:35:27.880]  Your fall has already begun, you just hadn't figured it out yet, every other cliche under
[02:35:27.880 --> 02:35:28.880]  the sign.
[02:35:28.880 --> 02:35:32.640]  Let's go to the Skexy Award, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:35:32.640 --> 02:35:43.920]  Oh, it's Lord Rockefeller, Lord Rockefeller at the next Builder-Berg meeting, it's Richard
[02:35:43.920 --> 02:35:55.480]  in Haas, out of the CFR, that's about what David Rockefeller looks like now, mine, I
[02:35:55.480 --> 02:36:25.040]  am still Emperor, oh, life extension failing, even though he sucked a lot of souls, oh,
[02:36:25.040 --> 02:36:36.640]  I like that one, that's Hillary Clinton, there's David Rockefeller, hey, Jim Tucker, what
[02:36:36.640 --> 02:36:40.440]  do you think David Rockefeller's doing there right now, probably slurping his soup, that's
[02:36:40.440 --> 02:36:45.360]  a Jim Tucker quote, all right, that's enough of that and a little enjoyment, also you have
[02:36:45.360 --> 02:36:48.960]  to denigrate the enemy, they don't like that being pulled, they want you to be scared of
[02:36:48.960 --> 02:36:53.160]  them, so don't be scared of them, they want you to worship them, they think they're powerful,
[02:36:53.160 --> 02:36:57.280]  they're a bunch of scum, and they want you to think they're invincible, no, you're not
[02:36:57.280 --> 02:37:04.560]  trash, only way you'll be invincible is you destroy the planet, I guess you are, could
[02:37:04.560 --> 02:37:09.160]  be invincible because you're so crazy, but you'll still fail in that process as well,
[02:37:09.160 --> 02:37:14.080]  we're gonna defeat you, human instinct and everything else is already activating, most
[02:37:14.080 --> 02:37:16.960]  of the people buying guns right now don't even know why they are, they say I don't trust
[02:37:16.960 --> 02:37:22.000]  the government, people know, they know, they know, Kevin in Kentucky, you're on the air
[02:37:22.000 --> 02:37:30.520]  sir, what do you think of the Coveted Skexy Award, hold on, the Coveted Skexy Award, do
[02:37:30.520 --> 02:37:39.120]  you feel honored to follow that sir, yes I do, good, yes I do, okay good, go ahead,
[02:37:39.120 --> 02:37:47.440]  I'm sorry, you had a great interview yesterday with Dr. McCullough, yesterday, I in my opinion
[02:37:47.440 --> 02:37:58.440]  used to be consolidated into just the issue of the GMOs, and vote yes, as he said, on
[02:37:58.440 --> 02:38:05.840]  the ballot initiative, that is the key, yeah, because if the states start letting us label
[02:38:05.840 --> 02:38:14.760]  food when it has insect genes in the corn or pesticide in the corn, it's over for them,
[02:38:14.760 --> 02:38:20.840]  exactly, and by the way we forced Prozac and all serotonin reuptake inhibitors five years
[02:38:20.840 --> 02:38:26.240]  ago after 20 years are close to it, to finally put on the label what their own study showed
[02:38:26.240 --> 02:38:30.600]  that it causes massive suicides and psychotic activity, now they're being sued and losing
[02:38:30.600 --> 02:38:35.840]  over that, that they knew, so see, we'll break their arm politically, we're gonna rip it
[02:38:35.840 --> 02:38:39.800]  out of their socket, I'm telling you, we got them out of the arm and it's like we're not
[02:38:39.800 --> 02:38:44.440]  letting go, it's like bail off with Grendel, Grendel may be big and bad and stink, at the
[02:38:44.440 --> 02:38:48.360]  end of the day, we're gonna rip his arm out, he's gonna bleed to death and go home to
[02:38:48.360 --> 02:38:56.880]  money, money to Haiti by the millions, it's time to send a little bit of money to one
[02:38:56.880 --> 02:39:04.640]  state in our nation and let them make a difference, if you really care about humanity, well if
[02:39:04.640 --> 02:39:11.000]  you care about beating these people, I mean look, the globalist are bags of scruffy-less
[02:39:11.000 --> 02:39:16.680]  buzzard droppings, literally, that's insulting to buzzard droppings and I mean that, buzzard
[02:39:16.680 --> 02:39:21.080]  droppings are actually part of God's creation, just the globalist look like buzzard droppings,
[02:39:21.080 --> 02:39:26.120]  I'll put you that way, the point is these people are the enemy of everything, you're
[02:39:26.120 --> 02:39:34.240]  not alive if you aren't in absolute total 110% opposition to everything the New World
[02:39:34.240 --> 02:39:39.400]  Order is doing, you're not alive, all these people are like I'm bored, my life doesn't
[02:39:39.400 --> 02:39:45.600]  matter, but you're not alive, you see the beauty when you're awake, you see the evil
[02:39:45.600 --> 02:39:52.080]  when you're awake and these people are shuttered, they're all TV heads that are so miserably
[02:39:52.080 --> 02:39:57.800]  unhappy, start taking some risk in your lives, start facing reality, start getting aggressive
[02:39:57.800 --> 02:40:06.360]  and you'll really be alive, so alive you won't be able to control yourself, I like that that's
[02:40:06.360 --> 02:40:14.200]  good, I appreciate it, I hear you brother, I hear you, I appreciate your call, let's
[02:40:14.200 --> 02:40:20.680]  go ahead and talk to Jason, I couldn't make out that last part, Jason and South Dakota
[02:40:20.680 --> 02:40:27.480]  you're on the air, how you doing, good brother, I just first off I wanted to thank you for
[02:40:27.480 --> 02:40:33.840]  the awakening that you've given me and through me, all kinds of other people, but I know
[02:40:33.840 --> 02:40:39.560]  you've talked about this quite a bit, but I found a particular program, it's called
[02:40:39.560 --> 02:40:47.560]  DoD Starbase, I don't know if you've ever heard of that, is that a TV show, no it's
[02:40:47.560 --> 02:40:53.480]  a program, it's a DoD Department of Defense youth program, yeah I've been on a bunch of
[02:40:53.480 --> 02:41:00.840]  their programs, let me see DoD Starbase, yeah you can go to starbasedod.org is their website,
[02:41:00.840 --> 02:41:13.640]  you'll see starbasedod.com, that's a thing for kids in science, I downloaded their annual
[02:41:13.640 --> 02:41:19.360]  report from last, 2010, no I found that it's a youth program, yeah I'm aware of this, they
[02:41:19.360 --> 02:41:25.320]  got an NSA CIA one too, go ahead, I was just going to read just a couple lines here of
[02:41:25.320 --> 02:41:32.280]  this annual report that I got, says the DoD Starbase program integrates DoD into the surrounding
[02:41:32.280 --> 02:41:37.520]  communities and enhances the DoD influence in those communities, it also allows DoD to
[02:41:37.520 --> 02:41:42.800]  develop shared conditions with the community, that will provide valuable educational opportunities
[02:41:42.800 --> 02:41:43.800]  to students.
[02:41:43.800 --> 02:41:48.640]  The only thing the DoD wants to do is it works for the foreign banks, is shut down your economy
[02:41:48.640 --> 02:41:54.800]  and so that you have to work for them and so it's like they blow your ship up and then
[02:41:54.800 --> 02:41:59.480]  shell you a life raft, and again not the people that are in the military themselves, but the
[02:41:59.480 --> 02:42:05.440]  DoD itself, I mean it's there, our government is not our government, sorry go ahead.
[02:42:05.440 --> 02:42:11.160]  It's just, when I ran into it it really bothered me because it talks a lot about how they're
[02:42:11.160 --> 02:42:20.080]  targeting at risk youth up in the poorer communities and how they're training them to be the workforce
[02:42:20.080 --> 02:42:25.040]  or the DoD in the future, so they're just trying to gain their military strength when
[02:42:25.040 --> 02:42:26.040]  they're young.
[02:42:26.040 --> 02:42:30.360]  I just wanted to bring that to light, I know you've talked about, no they're there influencing
[02:42:30.360 --> 02:42:34.000]  them, just like pedophiles try to get them while they're young, I mean this is a criminal
[02:42:34.000 --> 02:42:38.920]  system and you've got DoD recruiters lying and telling 14 year olds they'll put them
[02:42:38.920 --> 02:42:42.480]  in prison if they don't, you know sign the forms or have their parents sign them even
[02:42:42.480 --> 02:42:48.040]  though you can't sign them and then tricking them once they turn 17 or 18 and then they
[02:42:48.040 --> 02:42:53.360]  promote those people that do that and again it's just a total culture of criminality and
[02:42:53.360 --> 02:42:59.080]  again all you do is type in DoD Starbase, the second link down and you can actually
[02:42:59.080 --> 02:43:04.640]  put it up on screen for anybody that wants to be able to see that, that's not it, that's
[02:43:04.640 --> 02:43:07.720]  the hold on one second, that's not it, hear it, you want me to come show you, I'll come
[02:43:07.720 --> 02:43:19.240]  show you, I'll play music for a minute, hey thank you caller.
[02:43:19.240 --> 02:43:38.600]  Well I won't back down, no I won't back down, you can stand me up at the gates of hell,
[02:43:38.600 --> 02:43:46.120]  but I won't back down, no I'll stand my ground, I won't be turned around, and I'll keep this
[02:43:46.120 --> 02:43:49.600]  world running.
[02:43:49.600 --> 02:43:52.800]  Okay we were able to find it, there's a whole bunch of them, it's defense.gov, the Office
[02:43:52.800 --> 02:43:58.800]  of Assistant Secretary of Defense Reserve Affairs and it's a youth program and again
[02:43:58.800 --> 02:44:03.000]  they have this also with the Boy Scouts and they train them to kill veterans, it's like
[02:44:03.000 --> 02:44:06.840]  we're going to train you to kill the last crop and then we'll train the next group to
[02:44:06.840 --> 02:44:11.480]  kill you, because by the way do we tell you we're eugenics bankers who ate America, but
[02:44:11.480 --> 02:44:17.160]  we're wearing American flags so everything's fine, so there is that article, okay let's
[02:44:17.160 --> 02:44:23.320]  go to, oh I guess who's up next here, Lance in Kansas, you're on the air, welcome.
[02:44:23.320 --> 02:44:27.960]  Good day Mr. Jones, I just want to tell you thank you so much for all the work that you
[02:44:27.960 --> 02:44:28.960]  do.
[02:44:28.960 --> 02:44:31.480]  No need to thank me brother, no need to thank me.
[02:44:31.480 --> 02:44:35.800]  The risk you put you and your family into is awesome, I am a rookie, I've been listening
[02:44:35.800 --> 02:44:42.880]  to you since December 31st, 2011 and you are the only New Year's resolution I have ever
[02:44:42.880 --> 02:44:44.880]  kept.
[02:44:44.880 --> 02:44:50.560]  I grew up in a Catholic home in Southeast Kansas, I live in Lawrence, Kansas now, went
[02:44:50.560 --> 02:44:56.320]  to church, did all that Catholic stuff, four months listening to you, my religious faith
[02:44:56.320 --> 02:45:01.520]  is stronger than ever been in a Catholic church, I thank you.
[02:45:01.520 --> 02:45:06.120]  The gold with scum can kill me, but I will live eternal happiness in the kingdom of
[02:45:06.120 --> 02:45:10.160]  heaven with all of my soldier brothers of God.
[02:45:10.160 --> 02:45:15.920]  And also I have a testimony to give of this young Jebedy stuff, it is amazing, I have
[02:45:15.920 --> 02:45:22.080]  had three left knee surgeries due to football from high school and college, I need a fourth
[02:45:22.080 --> 02:45:29.400]  for a second meniscus reconstruction, I live in pain, lived in pain every day, it's just
[02:45:29.400 --> 02:45:34.080]  the question was how much pain would I be in when I woke up, it was a weather bad, severe
[02:45:34.080 --> 02:45:40.440]  pain, the weather is good, I am in mild pain, it would be January 2013 until I could have
[02:45:40.440 --> 02:45:47.000]  left knee surgery number four and I said I am not living my life that long in pain,
[02:45:47.000 --> 02:45:53.960]  taking these crap drugs, pain relievers, muscle relaxes, anti-inflammatories, three days on
[02:45:53.960 --> 02:46:02.720]  tangy tangerine, my pain is gone, I also started taking osteofex gloidal silver, the plant
[02:46:02.720 --> 02:46:08.200]  dried minerals, I feel like I am 15 again, in the gym strong as a horse.
[02:46:08.200 --> 02:46:13.280]  Now that's my problem is I am totally craved, let me just again sir, people say this was
[02:46:13.280 --> 02:46:19.560]  a set up call because they haven't tried it, I get all these vitamin and mineral offers
[02:46:19.560 --> 02:46:24.840]  all the time and won't take them because they've always are claiming this or that and I don't
[02:46:24.840 --> 02:46:30.480]  know if it's true, I want to promote what I believe in and as I said about 16 months
[02:46:30.480 --> 02:46:37.760]  ago or so, a station owner, I was out there speaking in central California, he was like
[02:46:37.760 --> 02:46:41.040]  look you just got to try this, Ted had been on it and they were telling him to have knee
[02:46:41.040 --> 02:46:45.760]  surgery, Ted Anderson was also out there and Ted said no this really worked for me, you
[02:46:45.760 --> 02:46:52.000]  should try it, so I got some, people around the office liked it, I never really used it
[02:46:52.000 --> 02:46:56.240]  because I wasn't in the habit, I took a little bit, lost like five pounds or something, it's
[02:46:56.240 --> 02:46:59.480]  not even weight loss, but it's just once you have the minerals and nutrients you need like
[02:46:59.480 --> 02:47:03.160]  with the beyond tangy tangerine, you're just not as hungry as I've said a hundred times
[02:47:03.160 --> 02:47:07.160]  and you know since you raised this and I happen to have a thing of osteofex right here because
[02:47:07.160 --> 02:47:10.680]  I take it, not that I even have a lot of joint pain and stuff but it's just it's so good,
[02:47:10.680 --> 02:47:13.560]  I've been jogging a lot more and my knees were hurting a little bit, not anymore with
[02:47:13.560 --> 02:47:20.440]  this, but the point is that Ted said it worked, then I watched Aaron in less than a year lose
[02:47:20.440 --> 02:47:24.400]  now over 90 pounds, but when he lost like 40, I was like that's it, I'm doing this,
[02:47:24.400 --> 02:47:27.920]  so I started doing just part of what Aaron was doing because he's back there, he's taken
[02:47:27.920 --> 02:47:32.520]  like three, four times of the stuff I am of young Jebedy and so I started taking like
[02:47:32.520 --> 02:47:36.320]  two or three of them and now I'm taking four or five of them and I've lost over 40 pounds
[02:47:36.320 --> 02:47:39.680]  and I've got so much more energy but yeah, that's part of the Alex pack, they've got
[02:47:39.680 --> 02:47:46.000]  discounted at infowarsteam.com, Beyond Tangy Tangerine, Ultimate EFA's, just the Super

[02:48:28.040 --> 02:48:33.440]  to me Lance and actually went and tried it, how fast did you feel the effect?
[02:48:33.440 --> 02:48:38.160]  See, we don't know that we're totally vitamin and mineral deficient because even if we take
[02:48:38.160 --> 02:48:42.520]  most of the so-called vitamins, they go right through you, it's the fact that these are
[02:48:42.520 --> 02:48:49.040]  organic, that they are the raw form and that it's liquid and that it's such huge dosages
[02:48:49.040 --> 02:48:50.040]  of it.
[02:48:50.040 --> 02:48:52.880]  What happened when you got on the young Jevity at infowarsteam.com?
[02:48:52.880 --> 02:48:59.040]  Well, it's funny because when I received the products in the mail, it was a rainy cloudy
[02:48:59.040 --> 02:49:06.720]  week and so my knee pain was at a six or seven on that stooped hospital scale they used and
[02:49:06.720 --> 02:49:10.800]  I just started with canine canterine and the EFA's only.
[02:49:10.800 --> 02:49:12.920]  Did you call it canine, tangy, tangy, tangy?
[02:49:12.920 --> 02:49:18.840]  No, my four-year-old calls it tang, tang, tangy, tangy, tangy, tangy, tangy, tangy,
[02:49:18.840 --> 02:49:20.160]  tangy, tangy, tangy, tangy, tangy.
[02:49:20.160 --> 02:49:22.480]  That's cute, go ahead and tell me more.
[02:49:22.480 --> 02:49:30.240]  Literally, it took three days for my pain to go away, my everyday chronic knee pain.
[02:49:30.240 --> 02:49:34.720]  One other myth I want to just clarify with all the other listeners, you promote it as
[02:49:34.720 --> 02:49:37.920]  a weight loss and say you get your vitamins and minerals, you lose weight, you're not
[02:49:37.920 --> 02:49:38.920]  as hungry.
[02:49:38.920 --> 02:49:45.960]  Well, I played wide receiver, I'm slim built and I'm not losing weight, I'm still staying
[02:49:45.960 --> 02:49:51.800]  hungry in the gym, I've just got my vitamins, my minerals, my energy, fuel for the fire
[02:49:51.800 --> 02:49:55.840]  in the gym, tangy, tangy, tangy, protein shake, rage against the machine and global
[02:49:55.840 --> 02:49:58.480]  hate and scum and I can move the world.
[02:49:58.480 --> 02:50:02.280]  Oh man, I need to do some of that, I need to start lifting weights, thank you so much
[02:50:02.280 --> 02:50:03.280]  for the call.
[02:50:03.280 --> 02:50:08.120]  I started lifting weights about once a week, I don't know, back in late November and then
[02:50:08.120 --> 02:50:12.440]  I dropped that weight on my chest and for a month and a half separated those ribs, I
[02:50:12.440 --> 02:50:17.440]  need to get back in the gym because that's really what's going to make me lose weight,
[02:50:17.440 --> 02:50:22.080]  I need to do the high repetitions, lots of it, naturally boost my testosterone with some
[02:50:22.080 --> 02:50:27.960]  dead lifting and squats and full body exercises.
[02:50:27.960 --> 02:50:31.520]  I've got to get in the gym, that's the next phase but I've just, I've got to find the
[02:50:31.520 --> 02:50:36.560]  time because I'm up here working most days till seven or eight at night, then when I'm
[02:50:36.560 --> 02:50:44.760]  on the weekend, I want to spend time with my family and get that jog in but it's important
[02:50:44.760 --> 02:50:45.760]  we all be healthy.
[02:50:45.760 --> 02:50:46.760]  Thank you so much.

[02:53:56.880 --> 02:54:10.960]  You know, Obama said he can ignore the Supreme Court, and he said Congress can go to a very
[02:54:10.960 --> 02:54:11.960]  hot place.
[02:54:11.960 --> 02:54:17.840]  But it is being reported Arizona has passed a law against the feds being able to secretly
[02:54:17.840 --> 02:54:25.240]  kidnap people, and it's instructing the county sheriff and state police and others to block
[02:54:25.240 --> 02:54:28.240]  federal agents from engaging in crime.
[02:54:28.240 --> 02:54:30.040]  Amazing from the New American Magazine.
[02:54:30.040 --> 02:54:31.520]  That's not getting any national attention.
[02:54:31.520 --> 02:54:32.520]  It deserves it.
[02:54:32.520 --> 02:54:38.640]  Now, here's another one, very exciting, feds spanked by Supreme Court over Arizona SB
[02:54:38.640 --> 02:54:39.640]  1070.
[02:54:39.640 --> 02:54:41.160]  I mean, it's a crime wave.
[02:54:41.160 --> 02:54:42.160]  Mexico's collapsing.
[02:54:42.160 --> 02:54:45.600]  Arizona went from low crime to high crime.
[02:54:45.600 --> 02:54:50.000]  They're trying to defend themselves, and they said, oh, it's racist to control the border.
[02:54:50.000 --> 02:54:55.000]  Well, the Supreme Court's saying, no, I mean, why do we have states?
[02:54:55.000 --> 02:54:59.440]  So I mean, the Supreme Court, as bad as it is, I got to be honest, I don't like the Republicans
[02:54:59.440 --> 02:55:03.120]  because they do a lot of police state stuff, but the Democrats in there, they all just
[02:55:03.120 --> 02:55:08.080]  want to like, if they were in charge, they would just completely got the country.
[02:55:08.080 --> 02:55:09.240]  But maybe that's good.
[02:55:09.240 --> 02:55:12.720]  Maybe just let them come, let them announce everybody's going to be arrested.
[02:55:12.720 --> 02:55:17.960]  I mean, so we can start arresting them.
[02:55:17.960 --> 02:55:18.960]  Here's a new headline.
[02:55:18.960 --> 02:55:22.880]  By the way, it is coming out that Eric Holder also helped ship hang grenades into Mexico.
[02:55:22.880 --> 02:55:23.880]  Part of Fast and Furious.
[02:55:23.880 --> 02:55:27.360]  Those weren't from gun shops.
[02:55:27.360 --> 02:55:32.040]  Obama should revoke Eric Holder's and come clean on Fast and Furious as Representative
[02:55:32.040 --> 02:55:34.440]  Stephen King.
[02:55:34.440 --> 02:55:37.600]  These are criminals that that's intensifying.
[02:55:37.600 --> 02:55:40.760]  Just so much amazing news.
[02:55:40.760 --> 02:55:44.880]  Also there's a big bailout being talked about with student loans, but that doesn't mean
[02:55:44.880 --> 02:55:50.560]  really pay off your student loans with taxpayer money because they're going to have socialism
[02:55:50.560 --> 02:55:54.440]  might as well be direct to the people, at least there's some benefit that way.
[02:55:54.440 --> 02:55:58.840]  I'm not even saying that's good, but no, it's just bail out because people can't pay the
[02:55:58.840 --> 02:56:04.120]  banks the student loans, but then still make you pay a reduced amount to them.
[02:56:04.120 --> 02:56:06.480]  Kind of like these mortgage deals.
[02:56:06.480 --> 02:56:09.840]  Yeah, we're going to let you extend your mortgage, but if you ever make one mistake,
[02:56:09.840 --> 02:56:10.840]  we instantly take it.
[02:56:10.840 --> 02:56:14.360]  You know, it's like, we'll take you out of the frying pan and put you in the oven here.
[02:56:14.360 --> 02:56:16.640]  How does that sound?
[02:56:16.640 --> 02:56:21.440]  Even in the economic news, it is all just wild record unemployment, record people being
[02:56:21.440 --> 02:56:26.400]  laid off, Federal Reserve running around saying get ready for implosion.
[02:56:26.400 --> 02:56:27.520]  We've got Salazar.
[02:56:27.520 --> 02:56:30.640]  No one knows if US headed to $9 a gallon.
[02:56:30.640 --> 02:56:36.160]  Department of Interior Secretary Ken Salazar said no one knows it may go to $9 a gallon.
[02:56:36.160 --> 02:56:39.240]  Total Twilight Zone information on that front.
[02:56:39.240 --> 02:56:43.800]  I didn't get to this yesterday and didn't get to it today, but the Wall Street Journal
[02:56:43.800 --> 02:56:47.760]  says a black box in your car and they go on to admit that's in this bill that will also
[02:56:47.760 --> 02:56:52.080]  let the IRS revoke your passport that goes on to describe it like I'm a conspiracy terrorist.
[02:56:52.080 --> 02:56:54.720]  They admit it's true, but I'm still bad.
[02:56:54.720 --> 02:56:58.880]  The same bill that allow the IRS to revoke passports of citizens accused of owning more
[02:56:58.880 --> 02:57:00.360]  than 50,000 in back taxes.
[02:57:00.360 --> 02:57:04.000]  Of course, it'll be $10 in back taxes later and they just say that too.
[02:57:04.000 --> 02:57:09.880]  They just say you owe it and take the right according to prisonplanet.com, a website of
[02:57:09.880 --> 02:57:15.280]  radio host Alex Jones described by Rolling Stone as a giant in America's conspiracy
[02:57:15.280 --> 02:57:16.280]  subculture.
[02:57:16.280 --> 02:57:23.480]  And I think they think that by saying Alex Jones says the black box is tracking you,
[02:57:23.480 --> 02:57:24.480]  it's discredited.
[02:57:24.480 --> 02:57:28.760]  You got it the other way around, but keep being delusional.
[02:57:28.760 --> 02:57:31.400]  Here's another one or maybe it's a fan sneaking it past the editors.
[02:57:31.400 --> 02:57:34.840]  I've been told by some big writers on this one that, listen, I'm going to attack you
[02:57:34.840 --> 02:57:36.640]  a little just so the info gets out.
[02:57:36.640 --> 02:57:38.600]  This is how I get it past the idiot editor.
[02:57:38.600 --> 02:57:42.200]  By the way, I'm putting info or stickers up around my neighborhood.
[02:57:42.200 --> 02:57:47.400]  I'm like, yeah, I mean, you know, more on editors.
[02:57:47.400 --> 02:57:48.400]  You will be crushed.
[02:57:48.400 --> 02:57:53.740]  Anyways, continuing, shiding biometric face recognition technology and transdermal sensors
[02:57:53.740 --> 02:57:59.040]  that prevent an inebriated person from driving a car info wars.com, another of his websites
[02:57:59.040 --> 02:58:04.200]  suggested that a system could be established that would force every driver to get permission
[02:58:04.200 --> 02:58:08.520]  with the government's already saying that it's us saying it from a government to drive.
[02:58:08.520 --> 02:58:13.880]  It's an iris scan demands their identity and good standing with the IRS.
[02:58:13.880 --> 02:58:18.240]  And it goes on to talk about the fact at all that's real, but I'm still cookie and that
[02:58:18.240 --> 02:58:21.080]  Ray Kurzweil is talking about it.
[02:58:21.080 --> 02:58:27.600]  Okay, a lot of other big news and info wars.com hands off the internet, new Ron Paul article
[02:58:27.600 --> 02:58:33.000]  just went up at info wars.com government secretly prepares to evacuate Chicago during
[02:58:33.000 --> 02:58:39.000]  NATO summit, Russian troops to target terrorists in America, all at info wars.com.
